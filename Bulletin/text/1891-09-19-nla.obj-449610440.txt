SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1801.
Bogus Banks.
The closing months of 1891 promise favour-
ably to see the death and burial of most of
the bogus banks of Australia. Within the
last few years these institutions have broken
out like an epidemic in all parts of this con-
tinent, but more particularly in New South
Wales. They mostly arose suddenly and
without warning. In the evening there was
only a void, and in the morning there was a
full-grown bank, with an enormous paid-up
capital, and a ponderous reserve-fund, and a
large sum to the credit of profit and loss
account. There w r as an empty office to-day,
and to-morrow there was a glaring pro-
spectus, also a table and three cane chairs, a
Hebrew with an overhanging beak, a pot of
ink, and an advertisement, and out of these
materials the private bank was constructed.
Some of these establishments had a more or
less remote connection with time-payment
furniture and oleographs that are traded off
on the instalment plan ; some of them also
dealt in bills of sale and loans which are
secured by a mortgage on the bedstead ; and
they all had a long list of directors who
struggled desperately to lend a solid, solvent,
affluent expression to their names by affixing
“Esq.” to the bald and naked “John
Hogg” with which nature had endowed
them. Now and then some especially thick-
headed and impecunious legislator appeared
on the directorate, but there was a second-
hand aspect about tire board and the entire
office—an unspeakable and indescribably
subdued air of back lanes and the
three-card trick, which prevented the new
institutions establishing an influential con-
nection in monetary circles. The staff’s eyes
were too close together, and it had too
much oil on its hair and bogus jewellery
on its claws, and it grabbed too hungrily
after the deposits, and it was too ready
to offer any interest under the sun so long
as it could trade off its deposit-receipts for
hard cash, and, taking it all round, the
“ bank ” was or ought to have been a trans-
parent fraud from the baseless assertion on
the front-door to t he ash-barrel in the yard
—from the chairman of the board down to
the office-boy—a fraud in its advertisement
and its prospectus and. its balance-sheet—in
its general manager and its auditors—in the
howling lie painted on the plate-glass w indow,
and in the blatant untruth on its note-paper,
and the soul-destroying perjury on its official
seal and its gigantic brass-plate. In short,
the average Australian private bank started
as an imposture at the beginning, and will
remain one till it bursts, and in all its deal-
ings there is no good in it.
* * *
There are certain infallible signs by which
the bogus banks can be invariably distin-
guished from those other institutions which
were built to last, instead of being merely
built to burst. In the first place, none, or
hardly any, of them had any visible begin-
ning. They appeared in a full-grown state,
without notice or any apparent process
of formation. Even in a country where
money is much more plentiful than in Aus-
tralia, the organisation of a great financial
institution is a work of time. It is necessary
to get the capital together, and the list of
shareholders is generally made up of the
names of well-known capitalists. But the
majority of the now “banks” of recent
years went through no preliminary stage
whatever, so far as the public eye could
discern, and the £200,000 or so of paid-up
capital was subscribed mostly by uncertifi-
cated insolvents, tenth-rate pawnbrokers,
cheap and gaudy clerks, and miscellaneous
individuals in nnpaid-for clothes, who had
formerly lived, with no visible means of
support, as commission - agents with no
commissions, or as money-lenders with no
money to lend. They were shifty-looking per-
sons with no furniture, no banking accounts,
and no assets ; some of them had been in
gaol, some of them were endowed with
aliases, a good many had been co
respondents, and almost all were otherwise
shady. All combined they could not reason-
ably be suspected of even the semblance of
affluence, and the assertion that they had
put up the alleged capital of even the
smallest bank that ever existed, without
turning a hair, was a palpable absurdity.
The manager of the institution was
generally tit and appropriate company for
the founders, inasmuch as he seldom looked
like a man whom any sane board would
leave in an unchained condition in the
vicinity of any capital—paid-up or otherwise.
The board, as already mentioned, consisted
mostly of certain obscure persons, all of
whom were denominated “Esq.” Half of
them gave no addresses, and the other half
hailed from localities where capital is
notoriously scarce. And, finally, the auditors
were almost invariably some now individuals
who had just opened a small office in a back
street, and who had no reputation to lose if
they attested and swore to the solvency of
everything and everybody in one act.
* # *
The bogus bank, having got over its preli-
minary stage, and emerged into the present
tense, may also be known by the manner in
which it pays lavish dividends and hungers
after deposits—deposits that are fixed for
three years, in particular--at any price.
It professes to make its income by discount-
ing bills, granting overdrafts, and lending
out money on mortgage, and in all these
branches of industry it is almost impos-
sible to realise more than 7 per cent, all
round on a steady average. The legitimate
bank, therefore, seldom pays anything like
a respectable dividend for the first few years
of its existence. It lends out its * own
capital; it also receives immense sums on
current account without interest, and lends
a considerable portion of them the
returns therefrom being clear profit ;
it prints notes and lends them at
interest—-another item which is mostly pro-
fit ; it pays small rates for deposits”, and
makes advances at high rates with the pro-
ceeds ; it gains a small but never-failing in-
come from the accidental destruction of
notes which go out in exchange for hard cash
and never comeback ; and even with all these
and many other sources of income its pro-
gress is generally slow. It is only when a
large reserve fund has been accumulated that
the genuine bank begins to pay large divi-
dends ; and even then in a period of great
depression it often gets into serious diffi-
culties. The National Bank of New Zealand,
as a fair example, has written off more than
two-thirds of its capital in losses resulting,
not so much from bad management, as from
hopeless stagnation; and all the profits of what
is commonly termed “ legitimate banking”
have proved insufficient to make business
profitable. But the bogus bank—a term
which probably covers three-fourths of the
institutions which have sprung up of recent
years—has h irdly any of these advantages.
It has very little paid-up capital to lend—of
that fact the long lists of notoriously im-
pecunious directors is a sufficient guarantee.
It makes little or no profit out of current
accounts, for it pays interest on them, usually
at a liberal rate. It has no note issue, and
thus a most valuable source of revenue is cut
off; and it pays tremendous rates of interest
for deposits, which is the one never-failing
sign that disasteivmust come to somebody—
or everybody—at some period in the near
future. Also, though its visible income is
infinitesimal and precarious it almost in-
variably pays larger dividends from the very
beginning than does the legitimate bank
with all its multifarious sources of profit.
* * #
The piratical financial institution lives, in
fact, mostly by taking in deposits and lend-
ing out the money of depositors, and in most
cases it pays for these deposits about two per
cent, more than it can possibly hope to
realise even in the most profitable branch of
business. The working expenses of the
establishment, the rents, the lavish salaries,
and the bad debts are all unprovided for, and
there is a dead loss besides. Therefore the
dubious bank always offers its most lurid
terms for deposits that are “fixed for three
years,” that it may have time to burst
decently, or to bolt, or to pass on the
responsibility, before the day of repayment
arrives. And in many cases it even offers
an additional inducement of one or two per
cent, on top of the original nine or ten,
provided the deposit is renewed for a further
term, which is an open and unvarnished
acknowledgment that the institution desires,
at any cost, to avoid repayment as long as
possible. The current rate of interest at
that future period may be only 4 3 per cent.,
and the banker who joyously pledges himself
to pay 10 or 12, regardless of all chances or
contingencies, is obviously a person who
would undertake anything, if the date of the
undertaking were only far enough ahead.
Occasionally, too, he announces in one and
the same advertisement that ho wants to
borrow money from the public at 10 per
cent., and is willing to lend money to the
public on mortgage at six—a discrepancy
which ought to give his scheme away even in
a lunatic asylum, for under this system any
man could lodge his money with the com-
pany and borrow the same money back at a
reduction of four per cent., and thus get a
gratis annuity out of the institution for
life. And the establishment which professes
to pay lavish dividends by giving away per-
petual annuities to everybody is a vain thing
and of no account,
* * 9
Another of the reliable brands and ear-
marks of the fraudulent bank is the land
which it invariably has for sale cheap, on
longer and easier terms than were ever
offered by any other institution. The deposit
is small, and the interest is generally about
5 per cent., although the property was
ostensibly bought with money borrowed from
the public at nearly twice that figure, and
the establishment almost objects to cash,
and would rather sell on slow instalments
than otherwise. And the reason of this is
plain and easy of comprehension, for the
land is mortgaged to the last extremity, and
the instalments, as they come in, are swal-
lowed up in salaries and interest, or in
staving off rampant creditors who decline
to renew ; and as the company cannot convey
the land to the purchaser when his last pay-
ment is made, it has a preference for long
terms, and would gladly fix the land-buyer
for three years or more, even as it fixes the
depositor. The ultimate breakage is inevit-
able, but if the mass of the deposits fall due
just about the time when the bulk of the
land transactions are approaching comple-
tion, then the establishment can collapse or
bolt with a light heart, and a joyous con-
sciousness that it has scooped-the last avail-
able cent from everybody concerned,
# * *
The fraudulent bank is the only institution
of its kind which ever inserts the goodwill
of its business as a valuable asset in its bal-
ance-sheet. It is the only institution which
professes to have commenced business by
buying up the valuable connection of some
impoverished individual who owned nothing
but a small office, and paying him a large
sum in cash as an equivalent ; and when this
is done it may be safely assumed that there
was no business to buy, and no capital to
buy it with, and that the sum in question
was stolen out of the deposits and divided
among the directors. It is also the only
establishment whose balance-sheet shows a
record of absolutely unfailing prosperity.
The genuine bank, however successful, has
its years of depression and loss, but the
murky concern, which offers such surprising
terms for deposits, always announces a
lavish profit, no matter how ruinous the
times may be. It may be known also by the
fact that the profit is always represented by
the increase in the two items, “Advances ”
and “ Freehold Property,’' In other banks
these items often decline, while the item
“cash on hand” increases; but in the
bogus institution the supply of actual coin is
always limited, and the whole profits are con-
centrated under the two headings above-
mentioned. This facts looks all the more
surprising at a time like the present, when
freehold property is falling in value daily,
and it is difficult to find good securities
on which to make advances; but the ex-
planation is sufficiently easy. The advances
increase, because the directors and the
manager, and the manager’s uncle and the
directors’ brothers, have all taken large
overdrafts out of the depositors’ money, and
“ blewed ” the proceeds on horses, or
jewellery, or wild-cat mines, or ladies
with golden hair, and as the money
will never be repaid, they charge them-
selves 40 per cent, interest with a light
heart, and the interest keeps the asset called
“ advances ” piling up in the balance-sheet,
and the balance-sheet brings more deposits,
and out of the deposits more dividends are
paid and more advances made, and all is joy
and serenity. And the “freehold property ”
also mounts up, because the company bought
land to the value of £lO,OOO, on which £9OOO
is still owing ; and collected £4OOO in
instalments from credulous purchasers, and
the land is now worth only £6OOO in
a falling market, notwithstanding which fact,
the complaisant valuator has given his certi-
ficate that the property is now good and
sufficient value for £13,000. And because
of the surprising prosperity manifested under
these two headings, the “ goodwill” lias also
been written up 30 per cent,, and thus a
glorious future is assured for everybody
concerned.
» * «?
The bogus bank might possibly eke out a
precarious, hand-to-mouth existence on the
summitof a land-boom, but in times of depres-
sion, or even in times of moderate prosperity,
its case is absolutely hopeless. Therefore,
it becomes a mere sepulchre for lost deposits,
and a burial-place for dead shareholders,
and makes hardly a pretence of solvency.
Its one unfailing feature is its ceaseless
hunger after deposits. Other banks at times
almost hesitate to receive these, when profit-
able outlets are scarce, and they are paying
interest on money which is lying idle in their
vaults, but the bogus bank clamours for them
at all times and on almost any terms. It,
will cheerfully undertake to pay nine or ten
per cent, to depositors, and ton per cent,
more to shareholders, and will offer at the
same time to lend money to the public at
five or six, quite regardless of the fact that
it thereby loses some 15 per cent, in addition
to Avorking expenses. It never does lend
the money to the public, of course, for some
of it goes to stave off impatient creditors
and the rest is scrambled for by the directors
and the staff; and it is regardless of the 15
per cent, loss—it would lose 65 per cent,
with equal calmness. Its books are chaos •
its balance-sheet is constructed by putting
down any figures that will slaoav a profit of
45 per cent. ; its officials drift into a state of
maudlin recklessness in Avhich they collarthc
money almost openly as it comes in, and buy
jewellery with it; and its paid-up capital and
reserve-funds are betAveen £300,000 and
£400,000. And then some day a creditor
avlio Avon t be staved off presents a claim for
£lOO, and after that there is nothing but
general smash and emptiness. Sooner or
later they mostly go the same road. The
bank whose one ambition is to get
deposits fixed for three years on any
terms is utterly and absolutely hopeless,
and even Peruvian bonds or the repudiated
debentures of Honduras are more promising
than its securities. And then the liquida-
tion comes on as the final act, and all is over.
Nobody sends the directors and manager into
penal servitude, for there is a doubt in the
alleged mind of the court whether the case was
one of fraud or mere negligence. Nobody
gaols the auditor avlio swore to the company’s
prosperity, though he was obviously either a
gross swindler or a person who obtained
money under false pretences, inasmuch as he
pretended to be an auditor and yet couldn’t
or didn’t audit. The only individual who
comes to grief is the junior clerk who got
demoralised and took a hand in the general
scramble at the last moment, and bought a
bangle for a barmaid with the proceeds.
And the luav always drops on him like
billions of bricks, for the code of this Chris-
tian land is built that Avay.
Woman's Work.
The Sydney Trades andi ILabour Council (loot
an important step when it decided upon the
admission of delegates from; women’s associa-
tions. But it did not amount f!o> the recognition
of any new or revolutionary principle.. The
earnest advocates of whatever it is that may be
implied by the comprehensive' and hazy term
“ woman’s rights ” are in error in supposing
that the Labour Council thereby gave the
weight of their approval to the incursion ®f
women into the labour market as competitors,
Avith men. That question remains just where
it was before. The real meaning of the action
of the executiA 7 e of associated labour is this:
Recognising the fact that the labour market in
many departments is largely supplied from the
ranks of the female sex, they see that it is
better, in the interests not of Avomeu only, but
of labour as a whole, that these workers should
be organised and in touch with the general body
of workers. If it be a good thing to have large:
numbers of women in the army of wage-earners,,
then the benefit will be made all the more pro-
nounced by haA-ing them properly brigaded and
taught the regulation drill. If it be a bad.filling,,
then this course will minimise the evil. The
affiliation with women who are actually Avage-
earners is a measure of self-protection for the
male workers, and it leaves the desirability of
having them as wage-earners an open question*
** # v
And it is a serious question. It is a question
that is not in any way settled by asserting the
fundamental equality of the sexes, or by the
repeated sneer at the chivalry of the man who,
in the struggle for existence, pushes his weaker
sister aside. ■ The problem is a bigger one than
at first sight it looks. It is more than the
Avoman » problem ; it is the race - problem.
Whether woman’s true sphere is in the home or
in the factory is, Avhile things stand in their
present position, a triviality only fit for dis-
cussion in a debating society. Whatever her
“sphere” may be, a woman has the same
natural right as a man to engage in the occupa-
tion she finds best suited to her tastes and
Avants, let it be Avhat it may. If her inclina-
tions lead her to boiler-making, then, as an
abstract matter of right, no one is entitled to
step in and throw difficulties in the Avay of her
making boilers. But the practical question is
not what is right in the abstract, but what is
expedient in actually existing circumstances.
In every quarter of the civilised Avorld
to-day we see men fighting for the mere
chance to labour, in the hope that if they
succeed in getting the chance, they and their
wives and families may attain to something like
the measure of comfort enjoyed by a badly-
treated cab-horse; and knowing that if they fail,
it spells starvation. That is now the normal
condition of millions of our fellow-creatures on
the face of the globe. It is the logical and
inevitable outcome of modern social and
industrial conditions. In. face of such a state
of things, all talk of abstract rights is mere
babble. Will the woman wdio goes boiler-
making intensify that state of things, or will
she help to mend it ? If she adds one jot to the
bitterness of the struggle, all the abstract right
in the Avorld Avill not alter the fact that her
influence is for evil,
# * #
The two watchwords of civilisation in its
present stage are Monopoly and Competition.
Monopoly places in the hands of one class all
the natural factors of production, and drives
the other class into competition for the privilege
of access to them. Wages are ultimately
regulated by competition. When competition
is unrestricted, the well-known “iron law
brings wages doAvn to the loAVcst point at which


wage-earner and those dependent on him
tlie x jgt. That is to say, the wages in any
ca Lv.nnitV will depend entirely upon the
con „ e size of the family and the standard of
aVel fort or discomfort —below which it is
Possible for that particular community to
TLml Suppose the average family to con-
/ t of four individuals, and the lowest possible
BIS on which they can live to be half-a-
Jlwn a-head per week, then under un-
' Hl j,.fed competition wages will inevitably
I to ten 1 shillings a week. If the
irerage size of the family be reduced, then
f hfl tendency of the wages will be to come
wn in proportion. Thus, if the number of
0 remaining unmarried increases until the
average family—that is to say, the number of
individuals represented by each worker the
Linker of mouths fed by each pair of hands—
p reduced to three, then the rate of wages will
, jto 7s. 6d. a week. In other words, every
Lir of hands will, under unrestricted competi-
Hon earn just enough to feed the number of
Laths that on an average each pair of hands
“ („ f ee a. Mouths, not hands, determine the
•ate of wages. If, in a community of 1000, 250
' wage-earners, their combined earnings will,
miwhly speaking, just suffice to keep 1000
months from starvation. If, then, 250 more
mirs of hands are pressed into the service, the
result will be, not that the combined earnings
will he twice as much, but that wages will fall
till the gross receipts represent as before, the
bare subsistence of 1000 mouths.
* * *
Such, in outline, is the iron law of wages,
where ’ competition is unchecked. Trades-
unionism has supplied a check, but in the
nature of things, as the workers are now
beginning to see, it can only be a temporary
one. If the fortress of monopoly remains un-
shaken, trades-unionism must inevitably, in the
L go down before the growing pressure of
Free Competition. And it is beyond question
that the presence of women in the labour-market
must intensify the pressure. If the women are
isolated, unattached, independent units, without
husbands or brothers, or lovers, to contribute to
their support, then their influence on the
labour-market is exactly that of so many un-
married men, with just so much difference as
arises from the lower wage which they are con-
tent to accept. But when the wage-earning
women are members of a family, they represent
a danger which always threatens to become a
disaster. So long as it is only in scattered
cases that the wife or daughter helps by her
earnings to eke out the wages of the head of
the family, it may possibly be that in these
cases the family is in a slightly more comfort-
able position than one dependent entirely on the
earnings of a single pair of hands. Taking the
previous hypothesis of 10s. as the lowest
weekly income on which the average family of
four can exist, then of two equal families, one
getting 10s. from the work of the father, and
the other getting 15s. from the combined work
of father and mother, the latter family is on
the face of it better off. It has a weekly
margin of five shillings. It can store up for a
rainy day. It can indulge visions of entering
one day into the ranks of the capitalists.
* # *
But let this system of wage-earning wives
cease to be the exception, and become the rule,
and the iron-law comes crushing down in its
irresistible, relentless might. Once the average
pair of working hands comes to earn on an
average more than is absolutely necessary for
the number of mouths it has to the margin
will inevitably be pared away by Free Compe-
tition. Where once the man earned 10s. for
his family of four, eventually the man and
woman together will be able to earn only 10s.
This we see demonstrated in Maoriland, where,
under the woman-compositor system, two com-
positors, man and wife, earn together very
little, if at all, more than one male union com-
positor earns in Australia. The law is
inexorable. Mouths, not hands, determine the
rate of wages. Woman’s work, whatever it
maybe for the individual woman, means for the
race of workers as a whole increased competi-
tion, increased power to the oppression of
monopoly. If monopoly is still to reign, thus
everything that increases competition amongst
the workers is an evil. There are at present
two divergent tracks which seem to lead to the
ultimate destruction of monopoly. Labour
may use a ballot-box and the forms of constitu-
tional legislation intelligently, and do it in that
way. Or the race of unrestricted competition
may be allowed to go on, until the pressure on
the toiling bottom strata of humanity becomes
intolerable, and the pent-up forces break out
in a wild, bloody, shattering upheaval, spread-
ing ruin and universal devastation. If this
last method is to be accepted as embodying the
only hope for mankind, then the sooner the
catastrophe is precipitated the better, and
every form of headlong competition, including
the employment of women and children as com -
petitors with men in the world’s labour market,
should be encouraged. But if any other solu-
tion of the great problem is open, then the
onus of proof rests on those who put it forward
as a desirable thing that women should exercise
her undoubted natural right to labour side by
side with man.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Pauper Franchise.
Ihe visual Conservative person levels this
conundrum at the Sydney Telegraph
h i am to keep step with the times I must accept the
yveed that men are no longer the architects of their own
fortunes, and that there is no appreciable difference
letween the thousands of intelligent working-men who,
■ v industry, thrift, and self-denial, practised through
many years, have made homes for themselves and their
a muies, and the lazy, improvident, self-indulgent crowd
M the result of guzzling, gobbling and gambling,
'ana themselves in the poorhouse. The former not only
Provide for themselves, but also for the necessities of the
mate while the latter are simply pensioners on their
oiinty. Gian led that some are in the workhouse from
mstortune rather than from thriftlessness or vice, si ill I
'Him the number would be small. Anyhow, taxation and
l' t )| c se ntati° , i are no longer to be correlated. Vi bat is to
the practical outcome of this freak ? The pauper vote
, . v ®rpool would greatlv outnumber that of the free
utm', 6 'Pendent who earn their own subsistence outside,
i. 1 e , at of Parramatta would probably be one-half as
lai Sc, &c., &c.
Wrong ! 0, corpulent Tory ; altogether wrong!.
Men are the architects of their own fortunes
still, and they rise on the stepping-stones of
dead depositors to higher things. But, alas !
it isn’t the individuals who were addicted to
“guzzling, gobbling and gambling ” who are in
the asylums, nor the intelligent workmen, en-
dowed with industry, thrift and self-denial,
who are outside. Nobody makes or can make
a competence by pure industry and honesty—
by digging, or pick-and-shovel business, or
other honourable employments of the same sort;
and it is the broken-down handicraftsman and
digger and pick-and-shovel gentleman who crowd
up the benevolent institutions. Almost anybody
can make a competence by being a bloated
guzzler with a totalisator, and such men
rarely get into a benevolent institution
in their old age. The D.T.’s corres-
pondent, in fact, has got the situation in an
inverted sort of way, and his facts are all
standing on their heads. More paupers come
to their sad fate through steady industry and
thrift than through any other cause. Some of
them got crippled and blasted through being
industrious in mines, and many more were
wrecked through falling off high scaffoldings
while toiling on tall buildings. A large num-
ber were thrifty, earned very little, spent very
little, and saved very little, for 50 years, and
then somebody bolted with their savings in
their old age, and if they had drunk the money
instead they would have died in middle life,
and never reached any poor old age at all.
Almost all of them came to grief through some
sort or variety of hard work, but the individual
who got disabled while loafing, or reached a
patriarchal age and became a venerable pauper
through hard eating, is a myth. The assump-
tion of the average Tory wdio writes to the
Telegraph, that a man who is poor must be
base and lazy, and that a man who is rich must
be honourable and industrious, is an obvious lie,
else the average monarch would bo dead-
broke, and the asylums would be full of
monarchs, while the ’bus-driver who works
16 hours a day for £2 a week would be a mil-
lionaire, and live in a marble palace. There-
fore, when the paralysing question arises, “Is
the pauper to have a vote ?” The Bulletin
respectfully answers Yes. It probably took
him 40 years of incessant labour and unfailing
honesty to become a pauper, and it would be
mean and ungrateful for his country to go back
on him in his old age. And in taking such a view,
this paper acts upon solid Scriptural authority.
When the Lord pronounced a blessing on the
poor He heaved His anathema at the rich and
the conservative and the people who write to
the Daily Telegraph. Ho did that because
He knew how little Judicious fraud and loafing
were required to make a capitalist, and what
unspeakable airs the capitalist put on by reason
of his loafing.

Immoral Combinations.
It would never do to let a number of men combine as
they pleased to interfere with the just rights and natural
liberties of others. — Brisbane Observer.
That certainly would never do—or, rather,
ought not to do ; but it is done daily. Pre-
liminarily— wanted, definitions. What are
“just rights and natural liberties?” The
Observer would tell you “ the right of any
man to sell or buy labour on any terms agreed
upon ” —which means the right to accept the
least which the man on top offers, or to starve.
“ Just rights and natural liberties ’’ include the
right of every law-conforming citizen to live
by his labour on full feed and during healthy
hours, and the chance to develope himself
physically and mentally to the extremest
possibility of his stature and dimensions.
Now, let us see who they be who “ com-
bine as they please to interfere with the just
rights and natural liberties of others.” The
monopolists. How' are prices of commodities
regulated ? By supply and demand ? No.
By “rings” and “corners” and capitalistic
combinations? Yes. The Adelaide, Melbourne,
and Sydney millers have been notorious for
their skilful manipulation of the flour market.
Their operations have put thousands of pounds
into their own pockets —the pockets of a score
—at the expense of thousands of people, thou-
sands of struggling toilers to wdiom any sudden
misfortune meant ruin. Was this a legal com-
bination ? What town householder has not had
a severe experience of the greed of the coal-
rina's, that even out of the extreme misery and
destruction of the big maritime stri ke extracted
merriment and hard cash —aye, and boasted
of it and gloated over it? Who needs to be
reminded of the steamship “ pools that
now squeeze the public like an orange ?
What about carrying-company combinations ?
What gas-user hasn’t been defrauded by gas amal-
gamations ? How about tram companies ? 1 o
say nothing of banks, stock exchanges, land
rings, and a hundred other capitalistic mono-
polies that are cupping the community of its
life-blood? These combinations that “ interfere
with the just rights and natural liberties
of others ” are everywhere strewn around.
Yet, papers like the Brisbane Observer
chant paeans of praise to their “ laudable
enterprise,” and tell us that all this ’ pro-
putty,” acquired bv moral fraud and chicanery,
is “sacred,” that it has “rights” to be vene-
rated, and that to challenge its tenure is to
introduce chaos. It is debatable whether chaos
itself would not be more intrinsically just than
the present lattice-work of robberies. The
Observer itself is in “combination” with
other capitalistic papers, and can’t stand on its
own feet. The Brisbane newspaper proprietors
and printing houses are all in this a ery category
of men wdio “ combine as they please, I he
vials of wrath of the Observer “ and sich ” are
poured out only upon the workman. These
conditions cannot continue. They are daily
changing. And the first combinations to be
put down are those of the monopolists them-
selves the horse-leeches wdio combine to bleed
the masses wdiite, and yet shriek of injustice
w lien workers unite.

The Sydney Morning Herald wants to know
if “ the Labour-party would think it equally
right for another large party to sit in the Acw
South Wales Parliament, simply and avowedly
as representatives of the interests of Capital ? •
This question is superfluous. The Labour-paity
has been returned in consequence of a wide-
spread idea that previous Houses sat simply,
though not by any means “avowedly, m the in-
terests of Capital. The party’s blunt avowal that
it has been returned in the interests of Labour
while believing that when these interests aie
best served the whole community is benentc
will possibly have the effect of unmasking those
who have, heretofore, served Capital only and
claimed to serve all classes. The Herald
then insinuates that N.S. Wales is going to the
dogs, because a number of measures are being
brought forward, “intended to secure special
a ’vantage to a certain class at the expense of
( .her classes.” Had the Herald spoken truly,
or possessed the faculty of seeing clearly on the
question, it would have said that these
measures were calculated to remove certain dis-
advantages under which “ a certain class (the
wage earners) laboured, and to deprive ‘ other
classes” (the landlords, employers and usurers)
of certain privileges of which they have become
unjustly possessed, and which are now held in
defiance of humanity and popular outcry.
The Herald objects to the time of Parliament
being so largely occupied with democratic
reform. For this the Labour-party are not to
blame, but Parkes and the other Ministers,
who have for years promised these reforms,
while religiously keeping them in the back-
ground. The representatives of Labour have
simply opened the flood-gates that allow the
long dammed-back tide of necessary reform to
pour through. The Herald objects “to the
demoralising courting, by word or act, of the
Labour-party. ” That will be unnecessary when
the party has a majority in the House, then
the Herald may rest in peace.
The general traffic manager of the Queensland
Railway Department recently ukased that
“ officers, including stationmasters, superin-
tendents, inspectors and telegraph-operators,”
should sever their connection with the Queens-
land Railway Employees’ Association “ as at
present constituted.” When pressed to dis-
close the gravamen of the objection to the
Q.R.E.A., the official reply was that the experi-
ence of the Commissioners was “ that strict
discipline cannot be so long as
officers and men are permitted to join the same
labour organisation.” This is the bogy of the
marine-officers-and-seamen coalition resurrected
and transplanted to railway soil. It might as
well be urged that it undermines discipline for
officers and men to belong to the same lodge of
Masons, of Oddfellows, of Buffaloes, or even of
Good Templars. Yet we see this phase of
equality every day. Among the tars of the
British squadron there are many Good Templars,
for instance, and in lodge there are common
seamen who are Templar officers, empowered
to sit upon their own ship’s officers if the latter
transgress any lodge rules. But Jack obeys
Brassbuttons just as cheerfully and loyally
when outside lodge meetings. The fact is that
Railway Commissioners Mathieson, Johnston
and Gray are toadying to the fads of Lawyer-
Premier Griffith, the exclusive, and Sir Thos.
MTlwbaith, the haughty. Minister for Rail-
ways Unmack has admitted that the Commis-
sioners’ order was issued “ with the full know-
ledge and sanction of the Cabinet, after
discussion and consideration.”

The latest New South Wales loan is a dreary
commentary on the prosperity that is born of
Foreign-trade, and on the hideous financial
muddle left by M'Mxllan, that alleged heaven-
born person whom the Foreign-trade press used
to hold up as the bright and shining light of
finance. New South Wales, as we write, wants
to borrow 44 millions at one jump, and if the
money is not forthcoming the province will
thereupon be up a tree, for the late Treasurer
left £1,800,000 of urgent liabilities behind him,
and there are £1,500,000 of old debentures to
be retired. Therefore the loan is to be
floated at a minimum of 95, and an extra
half-year’s interest will be thrown in, making
the real minimum about 93. If the loan
aces off the country loses over £300,000,
and o-ets only about £1,000,000 cash in hand in
return, which looks like buying ready money
very dear ; and if the loan doesn’t go off, then
N S.W. files its schedule. It is the same old
story. When a Treasurer retires in a hurry
owinv to ill-health or urgent private business,
it is about 24 chances to one that he is clearing
out because he has pawned the national shirt,
and is at his last financial gasp ; and therefore
he wants to hand over the muddle to his suc-
cessor. And the successor floats a loan grace-
fully because he isn’t responsible for the
shortage ; and when his turn comes he also
quits owing to ill-health, or something, and his
successor finds another shortage, and floats
another loan. And every Treasurer, when he
comes in, is going to put things straight, and
keep them so for ever, and nearly every
Treasurer, when he goes out, goes out hurriedly
because of ill-health. They are an unhealthy
crowd.

monstrous —pass the harp, if you please.
In the decade 1879-89 there was a decrease
in the number of first-class passengers on British
and Irish railways from 39,000,000 to 30,000,000 ;
a fall in the number of second-class passengers
from 03,431,000 to 02,878,000 ; but an increase in
the number of third-class passengers of no less
than 222,000,000! The democracy does move,
after all.
A cake of gold, valued at over £4OOO, from
the New Pinafore claim, was exhibited in an
ironmonger’s window in Brisbane-street, Laun-
ceston, last week. On the strength of the sight a
man borrowed half-a-crown to “wet the crush-
ing.” Two months ago he held some hundreds ot
shares in the company, but forfeited them through
his inability to pay calls. Shares sold at 335. the
day he borrowed the coin.
Fitzgibbon, since assuming chief control
of the Melbourne sewage, has officially announced
himself as E. G. Fitz Gibbon. The big G. fits
Gibbon capitally.
Gibbon, by the way, means a monkey. Fitz
means “the son of.” Ain’t it ?
The (London) Dwarf, says our corres-
pondent, appears to be fast attaining a large cir-
culation to the prejudice of the Hawk. Ihe
moving spirit on the Dwarf, is the well-known
American Mr. Chandor, whose name is not
unknown in English Courts of Justice in connec-
tion with the case of that eccentric old lady Mrs.
Bloomfield-Moore, who has a strange penchant
for young men, actors and mesmerists. He was
mixed up in some way also with the Hughes-
Hallett menage. The Dwarf owes its initial suc-
cess to the fact that Gordon-Cumming made use
of it to give to the world his story of the baccarat
scandal.
Dear Bulletin, —I notice in your weekly
by-references to the Irish Home Rule movement
that, whilst attributing the anti-Parnellite result
of the late by-elections to clerical influences, you
also attribute these influences to sinister motives.
Allow me to tell you that when you attribute
such motives to the great body of the Irish priest-
hood, you give your readers an exhibition of the
most glaring ignorance of the social status of, at
least, an important section of the Irish people.
It is, I know, unnecessary for me to inform you
that the root of all the discontentedness to be
found in Ireland is of an agrarian nature. While
the Irish farmers are constrained to support the
coffee-palaces and brothels of London and Paris,
for the delectation of their absentee landlords,
they and their families have frequently to eke out
an existence on potatoes [and Indian corn-meal —
a mode of livelihood that is naturally a bye-word
throughout the English-speaking world. Now,
as the great body of the Irish clergy come from
the middle-class farmers, would you kindly apply
to them the words of Virgil :—“ Non ignarus
mali, disco succurrere miseris.” From the time
they leave the cradle till they leave their father’s
home, they are unwilling spectators of the land-
lord lash under which they see their parents
wince. I take it for granted you admit they are
men _then don’t tell me that men educated in the
school of adversity, as they have been, can be so
dead to every human feeling as to pursue a course
that would be in direct antagonism to the welfare
of those who are related to them by every tie that
he world holds sacred. —Yours, etc., Blayney.
One Father Moore, of Melbourne, has
proved to the satisfaction of all good, confiding
Catholics that the Holy Coat at Treves is the real
maginnis. He tells the sweetest little yarn of
how a certain Empress Helena picked up the coat
(for a mere song, no doubt) on a pilgrimage to
Jerusalem, made for the special purpose of dis-
covering relics. Before, or after, annexing the
sacred garment, Helena found three crosses, and
was sore perplexed as to which was the right one.
So she routed around Jerusalem until she fell over
a sick woman, or, say a woman readied up for the
occasion by the Hebrew all-sorts gentleman who
had Helena in tow. Whereupon the Empress
prodded the sufferer with each cross in turn,
“ and when the third cross touched her she was
made well instantly.” “And so,” says good, old
Father Moore, “there is no doubt that that was
our Lord’s Cross.” Then, with a somewhat
sobered air of conviction, he adds —“It is not
probable that the coat which the Empress Helena
obtained as Christ’s coat was other than the true
coat.” Why, certainly not. Nothing is probable
except that Helena was an imperial idiot to go
and die in the ordinary way she did, when she
might have taken the cross back to Rome with
her, and have sat on it till the crack of Doom. As
for the few dealers who kept such a safe cure in
stock without administering a thump to the local
invalids—well, their disgraceful conduct seems to
indicate that they were embarked in the under-
takering line, and regarded immortality as
inimical to business.
The Australasian, 'in an article on the
Legal Profession Amalgamation Bill :
The distinction between the barrister and the solicitor,
between the public advocate and the man who prepares
the case and sees the witnesses and does all the routine
work necessary for a trial in the law courts, has existed
for centuries, and may even be said to go back to the days
of the Roman Forum. An arrangement which is thus
founded upon experience and has endured for many years
has surely something to recommend it.
A nice argument, this. Out upon the Roman
Forum ! Dirt and snakes are both older than the
Roman Forum, but they are just as objectionable
as if they were invented yesterday. The same
argument applies to lepers, and smashed hats, and
ulceration of the intestines, and if a thing must,
merely because it is old, have “ something to
recommend it,” then ulceration of the intestines
is obviously a noble institution. Therefore let us
whoop for ulceration of the intestines. And while
we are about it, let us raise three cheers for
murder, and sudden death, and premeditated
homicide, and ash-heaps —for old bones, bad
drainage, evil smells, the pig under the bed, the
a-oat in the rose-garden, stale fowls, ignorance,
dandruff, lies, paganism, nakedness, the slaughter
and eating of aged parents, alligators, pestilence,
worms old fish, slime, blasphemy, and decayed
eels for they are, all older than the Roman Forum,
and things that have endured so many years have
surely somethin?/ to recommend them. And the
only tiling, according to the Australasian s own
argument] that has nothing at all to recommend it
is the Australasian itself, for it isn't as old as
the Roman Forum or any other Forum—not by a
very large quantity.
A second edition of that most successful
book, The Bulletin's illustrated “ History of
Botany Bay,” is now ready. A copy will be
mailed to any Australian address for Is. Id. in
stamps.
O ! Andrew Clark, could you refuse
To go when you were bid !
It was no credit to your views
To act the way you did ;
Besides, put on what airs you choose,
Vou must believe in Kidd.
Bor 'tis a custom of the trade
()f which vou can’t get rid ;
When d outers come to patients' aid
The simple truth is hid
(Or smaller fees you would be paid)
Beneath a skin of lid.

Of justice I’ve a high sense— *
I want my liquor libertee,
But not a liquor license.

Fitzgibbon on the height of fame,
Alas! uneasy sits,
For since he changed his ancient name
They’re gibbing Gibbon fits.

My Dear Moorabinda, —
Strictly spring weather for the first day of the Spring
Meeting of the A.J.C., at Randwick, on 12th inst., with
ransacked wardrobes as a consequence, of course. The
two vice-regalities—Lady J. and “Her Excellency” of
South Australia—were very nicely turned out. Lady
Jersey’s dress was of salmon-pink crepe cloth made with
a demi-train and trimmed with greenish silver floral gimp
applique, basque of fine cream-lace finishing the round
bodice, which was made frontally in folds from right to
left. Bonnet in gold and pearls trimmed fore and aft
with bunches of red currants and leaves, black tulle fall
and 6cru lace parasol. Lady Kintore (accompanied by
the gude mon, ye ken, in a necktie too fight for his terra-
cotta cheek) wore a pale-grey lustre, embroidered round
the feet with grey chenille, and pansies and leaves in
natural colours, single pansies dotting all over the front
of the skirt, a border of pansies and leaves trimming the
bodice, which had a front of mauve satin smocked at the
top. A narrow sash in mauve and green satin ribbon fell
at the back, and the etceteras were a small bonnet in gold
wire trimmed with velvet pansies and leaves, and tied
with short green velvet strings, a black parasol with a
white ivory cockatoo on the handle, a miraculous match
in grey gloves, and don’t let me forget the rough-edged,
unmounted single eye-glass Lady K. applied to her right
optic at moments of excitement. It was a dreadfully
crude effort—something like the “ eye-glass ” the broken-
booted masher evolves (by grating on the kerbstone) out
of the wreck of a tumbler.
The other women promenaded the cropped green lawn
in the frills and flowers which are so pretty after the
sombre winter things. White, grey and fawn were the
general colours, the number of white gamps on the grass
poetically suggesting plum-blossoms blown by the breezes.
The prettiest girl I saw on the course wore cream muslin
with a small eau-de-nil spot, eau-de-nil ribbons about it,
and a straw hat covered with white ostrich-feathers.
Another pretty girl (not quite so pretty as her sisters used
to be) had a bad fit in pearl grey and a big hat trimmed
with white crepe and yellow roses. Mrs. Rupert Caring"
ton (now looking quite matronly) had on a black dress,
the seams of the loose jacket braided with Hussar braid,
vest of mauve satin, lavender gloves, and a small bonnet
trimmed with violets and buttercups. By-the-way, how
is brother Rupert No. 1 going to wear his gold watch-
chain ? It is now laced across on a level with his armpits,
and if it keeps on rising will probably end its career as a
necklace. Black, powdered with pansies, and a ridiculou 3
“ little” bonnet en suite was smartly worn by a gay and
festive society matron with an Edith Bland profile •
rich grey satin and brocaded gown with Louis coat and
demi-train edged with grey ostrich feathers was a very
handsome shell for a rather unprepossessing “ nut” ; and
a lady in green, with a Jersey nose, had unwisely crowned
herself with pale pink roses. The victorious Stromboli
was paraded on the lawn with the Derby ribbon round his
neck, and the spurred blood on his ribs, and really one
deduced quite a solemn moral from the sight. v
To sum up Spring fashions as revealed at the races.
It is evident that novelties are scarce, and that old styles
will keep in till Summer. All the best women were demi-
trained, a taking mode for the lawn, supplemented by
the “kerridge,” but a draggle-tailed exhibition for the
block, followed by the twopenny tram, and don’t you
forget it. One or two wore high paniers and coat-tails,
but without an “ improver ’’—this style looks wet-hen-ish
caught sideways. Skirts are mostly plain gored and,
judging by the revealed play of limb, usually worn
without petticoats too; basques were frequent, and round
bodices loomed around, while anything seemed to be
“as worn” in the hat fine, from a bow and a bunch of
flowers to a pointed thing the size of an umbrella. The
whole secret lies in the way you put them on.
Apropos of the “feasts” at which “ladies” fly round
with cups and plates, it is said that some of these philan-
thropists have petty larceny in their eye all the time, and
seize a bun here and a banana there —stowing the spoil in
a pillow-case pinned under their skirts, I suppose. One
well-known “helper” is a terror at putting her dessert
up her sleeve, so the other evening, as she went skimming
after bonbons-“for the men, my dear!’’—somebody
solemnly remarked : “ Mind you don’t take them home
with you, Mrs. Blank.”
The committee of the N.S.VV. Art Society held their
annual conversazione, at their Pitt-street location, on
“ IX Sept.,” as the programme (designed with a wondrous
tangle of naked cherubs and jackasses by Madame Roth)
had it, and a surging throng crept in, of course. The
committee, in double bowing-line, received the visitors
as they tripped over the mat, and lightning sketches by
most of the artists present, and songs by Miss Josephine
O’Reilly, filled in the time very soothingly—though it
must have hurt one artist’s feelings, as he made his
“lightning” attempt in a bored way, to hear a shrill
female voice remarking, “ Oh ! I know what it’s going to
be ! I remember it! ” And yet they say all women have
tact.
Those who went to gaze on Art by night got the dazzle
of gas in the glass of the pictures, and the colours hope-
lessly bewitched all along the fine, so they gave it up and
socialised. Lady Innes, in nectarine-coloured silk con-
trasted with apricot guipure and embroidered chiffon, did
the walls assiduously, and Sir George Innes was there
smiling at his purchases. Lady X, extremely see-more
in white and blue streamers, rested a fat, pink arm up to
the elbow in the acuted angle presented for her support
by an artistic K.C.M.G. and did the gallery frame by
frame; the chiding judge who “won’t have it” and the
chidden counsel were there, obviously not “playing
chaneys,” though it is a physical impossibility that one
should loo> *<<fcr the other’s head with a cold, unseeing
glare. Madame Roth, in sage-green and high-gilt wire
collar, and a string of savage’s beads round her throat and
a cluster of daffodils at the belt, looked like the frontis
piece to an Art Journal. Mrs. J. R. Ashton (wife of the
President) wore black and white ; somebody with pretty
fair hair was mermaidish in seagreen fisher’s net; and the
wearer of a grey frock with chiffon frills and gloves en
suite tried hard to look magaziney, even to the extent of
sitting on one foot on the deep-backed couches. That’s
the worst of artists’ celebrations. All the women have
such a predisposition to leave their corsets off and ruffle
their maiden hair, that an ordinary creature with just her
Sunday frock on has a vague idea that she is a jarring
note.
With the men fringing round the Gaiety shrine, ‘twas
small wonder that it seemed all skirts at St. Vincent’s
ball, held in the Town Hall the same night, and at which
six hundred turned up. There was a little rush of men
after the theatres, and the naval contingent (all insatiable
deadheads, who invariably argue that because their men
take their toothaches to be cured at the hospital they
ought to pose as free-pass pillars of that worthy institu-
tion) did their duty even to barn-dance lengths, so, per-
haps, those bevies of seated damsels were only resting'
after all. Vice-regal patronage of the most advanced
type, of course ; Lady Jersey, smiling and amiable, in
ivory silk draped with cream lace at the feet, caught
with tarantula bows of green velvet; green velvet hows
on each shoulder, and diamond ornaments. Lady Kin-
tore in faded puce, brocaded with ox-eye daisies and
trimmed on the bodice with white chiffon, diamond orna-
ments. Lady Scott wore a pretty girly-girly gown in
pale-blue satin, the skirt shrouded in pale-blue tulle, with
festoons of pink roses at the feet, the coat-tail train of
blue satin, festoons of pink unmounted roses on the
corsage. Mrs. W. P. Manning (Mayoress) opened the ball
with the Governor, and wore a handsome black lace and
jet gown, diamond ornaments. The rest was dust and
ashes, generally writing, because a handful of nice gowns
(I like a saffron brocade with beetles’-wing trimming, and
another fellow, with buttercup epaulets and simile Vutur
cups studding the gauze front suggested poetry) make me
forget a fat black-haired matron classically gotten up in
a red wrapper hauled in at the 4C-inch waist by a white
girdle ; or another Katisha in pea-green satin and a baby
sash tied high ; or a much-painted female in a mulberry
chiton and no corset, who had forgotten, or never meant,
to shake the powder out of her ears. The band was
rather erratic in time, and the floor rather fast, but the
supper was too well done tor a charity spec, as usual, and
among the people one wanted to smile at were Dr. de
Lambert, Mr. “Jack” Nathan, Mr. Wagner (from Mel-
bourne), M. J. Barlow, Mr. and Madame Kellermann —
and, of course, Dan O’Connor.
The Gaiety Company’s first fusillade of dangerous
puns at the Theatre Royal on Monday was certainly
the event of the evening—the place was powdered
with Governors’ aide-de-camps and things like that—
Wallington silhouetting his Wellingtonian profile in a
prompt box filled with a buck party, the boyish Earl of
Ancrum, in his element between two society girls ; and
society faces, led to the slaughter at seven-and-sixpence
per head, rose dimly from every velvet chair or perched
uncomplainingly on any ledge that offered. Neverthe-
less—perhaps because there were many men—the house
didn’t scintillate, except where the electric-light shone
on the gold-wash, don’t you know. The Hill party had
Mrs. Rupert Carington in the midst thereof in a
salmon-pink gown and opera-wrap edged with 6cru
feathers ; Miss Nellie Hill wore a black lace and silk gown
with electric-green butterfly in the hair. Mrs. S. A. Moss,
in the 0.P.-box, wore black velvet; and Mrs. (Dr.)
Schwartzbach with her, in dark red. Our Frisky in the
front row, as usual, wore cream, and the most elegant
woman there had a dim seat in the back row, but which
was moighty convanient for foregathering with nice
young men over the rail during the short waits.
In “Ruy Bias,” pretty Florence Levey and dainty
Sylvia Grey had nearly all the dressing, though Nellie
Farren (somebody behind me, of course not a woman,
enthused that she hadn’t altered an eyelash in the last 20
years) wore a taking black and silver rig on her first
rapturously-received entrance ; and a violet velvet and
satin cap and gown with a glitter of diamonds, was
festive. In the first act, Levey, who dances like a daffo-
dil, wore a rather “suburban” effect in pink with
caterer’s-decoration-like garlands of white flowers, but
Sylvia Grey (an hilarious medico in the circle—which his
name is Mac., and he is getting bald fast, poor man—wildly
shrieked—" Oh, you beauty 1” as she finished her first
pas seul) wore a lovely frock in sulphur-green silk with
sprays of wistaria on the bodice, the Turkish effect under-
neath in purple silk edged with single flowers, and a waist,
scarf of white spangled in silver giving an airy effect as
she kicked. And, by the way, why don’t lady Thespiennes
who turn the scale at 16-stun exercise as danseuses in
their off time ? If it enlarges the calves, it certainly
spiderises the party from thence up’ards.
The “ Arts and Science ” Exhibition in connection with
the Sydney Y.M.C.A. was opened to slow music on Bth
inst., when a good crowd thronged in. The show was not
at all fine-drawn, and what surprised me about it was the
manner in which water was shown up in its bonniest
fight. In the model-department, there was some>water
in a glass bulb with the air extracted, and which made an
awful racket (like somebody spilling tacks) when shaken
up and down, and the principal microscopic draw was a
drop of water, in which horned blue monsters with ten
tails went swarming about. Now, this didn’t strike me
as being a good way to lure the members on to the filter.
An interesting exhibit was a five black-and-red snake —
the first time, in all probability, that a snake was ever
seen at the Y.M.C.A.—and a fire-screen, designed in
raised waratahs and foliage, was beautifully worked*
Is it true that an Australian M.P. is going to remove
his butterfly spouse some miles back, out of touch with
her crowd of Petrarchs? If he does, he should photo-
graph every Lovelace on his retina, or else he may be
tricked as was another gentleman who carted his flirty
pansy-blossom a “ hundred miles from the railway line,’’
where the giddy moths soon forgot her, except one who
roamed along one day in the guise of a jewellery-
drummer. He had only disguised his fatal beauty under
a red moustache, but hubby entertained him because “ he
could see he was a gentleman ” —bought a watch from
him, but neglected to set one on him, and—but what is
the use of sketching the result ?
Sydney citizens—instigated by Rev. Mr. Shearston, of
Trafalgar House, ably seconded by Mayor Manning-
entertained the petty officers and crews of the Britisli
fleet at high tea and a concert in the Town Hall, on 10th
inst. Provision was made for 700, but only GOO turned
up at the nicely laid and decorated tables set in the base-
ment. Dozens of helpful damsels spilt gravy and vege-
tables all over poor Jack in a winning amateur way, and
even went to the length of pinning nosegays into his flap
collar. The cross table at the top (under the care of Mrs.
Berry Drinan) had the Mayor for centre-piece with Mr.
Daniels, Mayor Stokes, Rev. Shearston and others
scattered around, and although the quenchers were only
tea and coffee the break-up was very lively—marines
waltzing together, and some of the tars barn-dancing
when the cigars began to circulate.
At the concert in the upper hall a large party had seats
on the platform. Sir “ Precedent” was there, gold-bound
as usual, taking copious notes with a silver pencil. Lady
Scott (who doesn’t like Hobart-or can it be the Hobart
people?—well enough to put herself to the trouble of
going there this time) looked unutterably bored in a mul-
berry gown toned with black guipure, jet bonnet, and
half fall. Mrs. Manning (Mayoress), in heliotrope and
bonnet en suite, held the beautiful bouquet of English
primroses, violets, ferns, and snowdrops presented by the
sailors ; and two well-known Sydney ladies in the pat-
ronising party wore evening dress, but wisely kept their
cloaks on when they saw how the cat jumped. The
artistes contributing comprised Colhourne-Baber (who
secured an enthusiastic encore and a bouquet for her
“ Kerry Dance ”), some of the Sydney Liedertafel filters*
Mr. Schoou (encored for his cornet solo), and M. Wiegand,
and, of course, there were speeches to the gallant tars,
who presented rather a Bacchanalian appearance with
wreaths of flowers around their necks-some with three
and four white lilies in their jumpers. Which reminds
me that some of the sailors took the floral display for an
indigenous effort, and one man held up a pink camelia
with the query—“ Do these yere grow in the fields,
miss ?”
Governor Jersey isn’t reputedly a plunger, hut it cer-
tainly looked rather suggestive to sec Ills Ex. foot-
padding it home on Derby-day through the Centennial
Park. It gave him a dead-broke aspect as if the hollow
joy of “picking them” had induced him to render up
even his cab-fare, and his bools w ere dusty and his hat
ssemed several sizes too much, and if he hadn’t been a
banker-governor anybody would have taken him to he
the ordinary “knowing” race-frequenter suffering a bad
attack of disillusion. Which reminds me that the
Sydney high-world coterie have of late taken to
“Shanks’ pony” with great enthusiasm—possibly to
reduce undue avoirdupois with an eye to the subjugation
of the Gaiety girls, who may cherish an objection to
tickling double chins.
A certain Australian Legislative Council has at least one
member at the present time who is unable to conform to
the modern prejudice that requires a man to he able to
write his own name, or that of his rich employer. A
candidate for a coming L T pper House election is not going
to have this slur cast upon him though, and on com-
mencing his campaign he placed himself under the tuition
of an able instructor in caligraphy. Success appears to
have crowned his efforts, for lie can, with only three
weeks’ practice, laboriously scrawl his cognomen on a
sheet of paper after the manner of Brough in “ Dandy
Dick.” The tutor has hopes that by the time the election
comes off, his pupil will be able to write with his tongue
in his mouth, and without his front hair in the ink bottle-
One skeleton in the cupboard is generally as much as
most men canstand, but the man who bought Dr. Beaney’s
celebrated skeleton evidently thinks that one more or
less in the house doesn’t matter.
A penchant for other men’s wives appear to run in
families. A very near relative of a youth who not long
before his death figured as co-respondent in a Riverine
divorce-suit, heard in Sydney, lately visited Melbourne,
and returned to England by a recent mail, not alone. The
children and the injured husband were carefully left
behind.
The original owner of a station (at which an Australian
Governor was lately entertained) and grandfather of a
lady who, the other day, made what is generally regarded
as rather a brilliant match, lost all his money and friends,
and for some years before his death was an ostler at a
Murray River shanty. The present owner of the station
commenced fife as an ostler in Purcell’s Horse
Bazaar. This lively stable has been a mascotte, and more
than one millionaire commenced fife here as a valet des
chevaux—beginning with Tommy Monahan, of St. Hilda,
and including—a St. Hilda squatter who owns magnificent;
N.S. VV. property; the late richly-gilded Mickey Dawson
(before he went into private practice), father-in-law
of Fitz Gibbon and a certain millionaire ex-coach,
whip, not unknown in connection with Mount Morgan.
Mr. Charles A. Harris, lately with Dr. Slate, has
begun the practice of his profession as a dentist at
St. James’ Chambers, top of King-street, Sidney, with
a boy in buttons, a suite of artistic rooms, afternoon
tea for lady sufferers, and a charming lady-assistant who
holds the patient’s hand and sees that the reviving spray
doesn’t take the crimp out of her front hair. Mr. Harris
is an enthusiast, and has several new ideas. Nervous
people wifi all like the artificial teeth that can be screwed
into stumps in the gums instead of having those hard and
fast nuisances pulled out.
Fanny Enson’s benefit at the Criterion on 9th inst. drew
the usual crowd of women solemnly chewing chocolate
with their Sunday frocks on, there being the same per-
centage of men present as there are stones to a grocer’s
pound of plums. The “Man-woman” was there, with
her arms folded, and one lady, evidently not a matinee-
haunter, came in a white evening dress with kid gloves,
but quenched her glory under an ulster as she grasped
the tailor-built situation. On the stage, Mrs. Brough, in
the Screen scene from “School for Scandal,” wore a cen-
tury dress in ivory satin and yellow ; but Cates, as the
naughty man, was altogether too ethereal for a black-
satin suit—beside the paniers of Lady T. he looked like
the shadow of a stick of licorice.
Miss Frances Cogdon (with a dot of £60,000) was united
in the bonds of matrimony to Mr. Alec. MTntyre, in
Melbourne, the other day. Alec is fair, fat and 50, and
might be mistaken at a cursory inspection for Duncan
Gillies. His claims for distinction rest principally on the
fact that he was an adorer of the famous Emelie Melville
company in their palmiest days. The lady is the only
daughter of the late Police-magistrate Cogdon, the
handsomest man in Ballarat, in the early sixties (they do
say he was brought out of his room at Craig’s with his
beard in curl-papers) ; the cash, however, comes from her
grandfather, Bob Threkeld, an old Melbourne identity,
whom all old colonists will remember at Kirk’s livery-
stables, and afterwards at the Saracen’s Head. Alec has
not been treated with reckless generosity in the matter of
settlements.
A very fashionable marriage parade was nipped
in the bud recently by the death of the
bride’s grand - aunt or somebody. This was most
aggravating, after the bridegroom had arranged to
pay £5O (of the bride’s money) to ring the Cathedral
chimes all day ; another £5O out of the same purse, for
retaining the services of his Lordship the Bishop—and a
like sum for the assistant supernumeraries. The wedding,
however, came off directly the funeral was over ; so that
the funeral baked meats served tor the wedding-breakfast,
Yours affectionately,

The annual ball given by the East Zetland Masonic
Lodge at West’s rooms on 3rdi nstant, added another one
to the list of successful Sydney Masonic balls held this
year, commencing 8.30 and ending next day. Mr. J.
Harris represented the Grand Lodge in wonderful regalia,
and Mrs. Nicholls wore the handsomest dress—yellow silk
and seed pearls. The supper was very well done.
Mrs. W. P. Manning’s dance is to he held in Sydney Town
Hall to-night (Thursday). It is expected to’degenerate
into a hall.
Manly Wild Flower Show takes place on 23rd instant,
and the usual floral ferment is now going on at Our
Village. Discreet matrons sail forth in spring carts at
early morn to catch the lurking waratah in his lair.
Gov. and Lady Jersey entertain the members of the
Synod at a garden party at Government House on 25th
instant. Interesting that the Synod and the A.J.C. meet
at the same time and season !

Not having been seen in Sydney for
about four years, “ lolanthe ’’.proved a trump card
that might have been turned-up to advantage at
an earlier period. Crowded houses followed it
from start to finish, and on Saturday, the closing
night, when the Comic Opera Co.' received an
enthusiastic send-off, much money was turned
away.

Of “ Ruy Bias” it may be said in the
words of a German critic : “ This may funny be
in the land of roast-beef and plum-pudding, but
vulgarly stupid and inartistic seems it here.” It
is simply highly-gilt bosh, with even less con-
tinuity of purpose and ingenuity of situation than
“Evangeline,” chock-full of stage-tricks that are
stale, and puns that are passe, albeit brightly
carried off by folks whose gifts might have been
more fitly devoted to higher branches of the art to
amuse. Even when viewed as an avenue for men
to discover how women look when partially divested
of the delusiyeaids to contour supplied bymilliners
burlesque fails in what might be assumed to be its
purpose, for the improvements provided by pads
and puffs, tucks and pigments, are calculated to
mislead the most critical eye that ever blinked
through an opera-glass. “ The proper study of
mankind is woman 1” Yes, but when you place
50 or 100 women before an audience of men there
is no opportunity for critical study or analysis.
Two shapely limbs are more seductive than a hun-
dred so-so ones, just as a nicely-cooked gigot
right under your nose is more appetising than
fifty legs of mutton hanging up in the butcher’s.
Woman, collectively and in the raw, is always
inane, usually tedious.

All the Gaiety folks, especially Farren
and Leslie, were warmly welcomed back. We
don’t see much alteration in any of them, either
for good or bad, except, perhaps, in Storey, whose
new eccentric dance seems more suggestive of com-
plete dislocation than anything he did here during
the prior visit. Of the new people, Grace Pedley
is no great vocalist, but sings pleasingly. She got
warmly encored by an easily-pleased house on
opening for “The Song that reached my Heart,’’
though, with the surroundings, “The Bloke that
sneaked my Tart ” would have been more appro-
priate. Florence Levey is a very graceful dancer,
who achieved at least equal rank with Sylvia Grey
ere the conclusion of her first caper. Nelly
Farren, suffering badly, so ’tis said, from influenza,
was just as raucous and as popular as ever, and
Leslie still travels on the bald-head racket. Danby
got a big encore for “ After Me,” sung in a back-
slum, long-beer voice, but refused to sing “Bally-
hooly,” saying that if they (the audience) had not
forgotten it he had. One of the funniest things
in the show is the Leslie-Farren burlesque, on the
minstrel manner, in “ My mother told me so ” and
the alleged clog-dance that follows.

It would be just as well to have the various
gags localised, for the Sydney “ push ” don’t hold
much stock in the Eastern Market and Ballarat.
By the way, the scenery, especially of the first and
third acts (Gordon’s), is very beautiful.

There are some smart quips in “The
Ambassador.” The definition of a man of the
world as “One who knows better and does worse,
and so cosmopolitan that he embraces more women
than his wife,” for instance ; or this, “Moralists
say we’re never so happy as when we are good,
but the truth is that we’re never so good as when
we’re happy.” Despite this happiness of phrase,
however, it was unfortunately withdrawn in
favour of “The Middleman” on Saturday night.
Unfortunately, because there is such a lamentable
difference between the last and the first perform-
ance at Sydney Garrick of that peculiar play. Of
the original east, only five remain in the bill and
all as originally placed. They are excellent as ever;
For the others, let silence be the tombstone over
efforts abortive and uninteresting—nay, wearying.
Three nights of “ Tatlow ware ” were followed by
two of “The Profligate,” and one each “A Scrap
of Paper” and “The Idler.” “The Village
Priest ” goes up on Saturday for six nights, and
the Darrells open on the following Satm-day in, it
is said, “The Sundowner,” while Cartwright and
Co. fly to Brisbane, where they play a twelve-
night season, returning to Melbourne for a fort-
night ere sailing for England.

Sydney Her Majesty’s was visited by the
officers of the auxiliary squadron on Saturday
night last, but their presence in the dress-circle
failed to induce that influx of the fair sex that
might have been anticipated, and so they sat and
glowered at each other in solitary silence dismally
thinking what heaps of loveliness they were wast-
ing on a desert bare. George Rignold celebrated
his fourth year of management by giving away
souvenirs, varying in value from a shilling to fifteen
guineas, on Monday last, but, dripping wet from
his dive into the many tons of water that compose
the Regent’s Canal, was obliged to depute Harry
Jewett to speak a piece for him to the clamorous
audience. Wednesday night closed the season,
and the Company skipped on the following day to
Melbourne. Laura Yilliers opens on Saturday m
“ A Celebrated Case.”

less amusing, took its place on Saturday

so enjoyable as formerly. Mrs. Brough

as did George L. Gordon’s Mr. Meanly, a creature
Addled in vellum, bound in red-tape, and
labelled “Soulless quilldriver.” Annie Taylor’s

mnted cook, but was forcible enough. Neither
Miss Spoug nor Bessie Major filled fully
the slippers of their predecessors, and the

scene, a hall with many exits, identical with that
of the representation of “ Friends,” is very ex-
eellentlv painted by Spong and Churchward, and
furnished’ in better taste and with more judg-
ment than anything in its line yet seen here.

The benefit given to Fanny Enson, prior
to her departure to England, was scarcely so well
attended as the occasion deserved. Bessie Kig-
nold opened by singing “Lights o London
Town” from the orchestra; then Win. Rignold
successfully burlesqued the manner of the very
heavy tragedian in “T. he Lights, aided by Her
Majesty’s Co. Old Cathcart, as bir Peter, ovei-
lapped his associates; Mrs. Brough, Messrs.
Cates. Greenaway and Welch, in the screen-scene
from “ The School for Scandaland the Criterion
Co aided by Myra Kemble and Emma Gwynne,
played a slab of a not very effective act from
“Impulse.” The Sasses played their “Umbrella
comedietta; Harry Jewett finely recited Shamus
O’Brien,” and Louise Davenport trotted out the
trashy, toadying “Kissing Cup’s Race,”
of tomrnyrot in which there is at least one sir
in each line. Ryley sang “ For Love of Thee,
and Elton did “ The Dashing Mihtaire.” Results
at treasury, respectable.

Every one should applaud organist
Wiegand for having the courage of his opinions in
refusing to play nothing but the “ ugly ” music of
the so-called advanced school of the day. The
Bullei’lN has no patience with the twaddle talked
by some people on this subject. Wild, weird,
long-haired cranks rush up and down the piano,
producing a complete kaleidescope of hideous
chords and call it the ‘‘advanced
Violinists struggle wildly with helpless fiddles
and tear out wails that might well be taken for
the cries of a porker in distress, and this forsooth
they tell us is the new school ! Melody, pure and
simple, is regarded with ineffable scorn and yet
Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Handel, Haydn,

The Dampiers finished up their season at
Adelaide with that old, invariable yell of agony,
“East Lynne.” It came off with all its ac-
customed vigour ; but the old play badly wants to
be re-written. If Levison’s bell-topper were a
shade less shiny, and if Lady Isabel would swear
in her exile instead of weeping with such a damp,
oppressive weep, and if she would return to find
her heir putting a head on another boy, instead of
snuffling in the last stage of Sunday-school con-
sumption, and if Archibald Carlyle could be run
over by a bullock-dray before the play begins, and
somebody could come on in the first act and
mention casually that he is dead, things would be
much better. Anvhow, the company escaped
alive, and will reproduce Mrs. Wood’s dreary
shriek at Broken Hill, unless a justly-outraged
Providence intervenes, and the scenery is struck
by lightning, and the takings are blasted by the
artillery of heaven. Tanner has finished his fast.
He was a slow exhibition while he lasted, and the
sight of a thin and hollow human being sitting in
a chair, and thinking mournfully of provisions,
grows wearisome in course of time. Johnel
.Sullivan has also gone to Adelaide. His reception
in that mild, quiet, grandmotherly city, and how
he puts a tail on the audience, and the number of
waiters he has killed, and how he goes home and
gambols with his mighty feet on the ruins of the
supper, and prances amid the mustard and grease,
and dashes the furniture to Sheol and back again,
when business is bad, may possibly be further
alluded to on some future occasion. With the ear
of faith we can hear the hollow crash of his
arrival, and the groans of the ticket-taker who
committed suicide by asking Johnel for his ticket,
and we can just make out afar off the noise of
John wrecking his cab with his fists because the
driver doesn’t go fast enough. Williamson’s
Comic Opera Co. will open shortly in the “Gon-
doliers,” and Stacey starts at Garner’s Rooms
with “Hans the Boatman,” as soon as billiardist
Roberts vacates. Monty Brown, manager for
this latter show, loolced with a cold, injured
expression upon The Bulletin’s local representa-
tive, and declined to let him in. This was mis-
placed humility upon his part. The Bulletin
man is not at all haughty, and if he had gone in
he would have associated with the manager on
equal terms, and wouldn’t have looked down on
him in the least. The pressman who would hurt
the feelings of a humble but well-meaning
theatrical individual takes a base advantage_ of
his superiority, and is unfit to be an Australian
citizen.

Melbourne Princess’ was ominously un-
crowded on Saturday night, when “The Late
Lamented,”—a title bearing no reference to the
lost Gaiety Company—put in a first appearance.
Adapted from “Feu Toupinal,” by Mr. Fred.
Horner, this farcical comedy is a maze of mis-
understandings, and a joke that seems too in-
geniously complex for a weak-minded audience.
Undoubtedly, it is a clever piece of work. Horner
lias put in his thumb and pulled out all the best
French plums from the original pie to flavour his
English version.. But much of the fun, being of
the subtle kind that requires quick appreciation
and rapid consumption, was lost in the rough and
insufficiently rehearsed performances of Saturday.
“The Late Lamented” was a mercantile person
named Nicholson, with mutton-chop whiskers,
who divided his domestic life into equal parts and
left a couple of widows to revere the same
memory, unbeknown to one another—a tame, but
determined widow in London, and a wild, frisky
little relict on the island of Cyprus. The
bereaved females marry again, as women will
under slight provocation, and when the curtain
rises they are living on two different flats in West
End mansions, with the two different flats who
(also unbeknown to one another) are filling poor
dear Nicholson’s two pairs of shoes. In each
instance the course of true second love runs
smooth although the husbands offer some
slight objections, on principle, to the constant
laying of floral tributes on Nicholson’s sarco-
phagus, more especially as they themselves are
always pressed into the solemn pilgrimage to the
bone-yard, and compelled to carry the basket. The
widows never happen to meet on these occasions,
nor to notice that somebody else has been strewing
flowers over Nicholson’s mouldering dust. It is
possible that boys promptly come and steal the
blossoms immediately after each visit. Portraits
of Nicholson, in his habit as he lived at “ home ”
and in Cyprus, hang in the best room of either
flat, and that commonplace impostor is decaying
in an odour of sanctity, so to speak, until an old
military mash of the larky Mrs. N. comes visiting
the gentleman who took over the other Mrs. N.
The misleading disclosures made by this major
from Cyprus, assisted by elaborate misconstruc-
tions elsewhere and the general idiocy of a man-
servant produce two acts of tangled agony ter-
minating in the usual explanation. The ghost
of Nicholson gets into hot water as the curtain
falls. An uneasy and, in many cases, ill-fitted
cast made but a poor start with “ The Late
Lamented,” as already mentioned. Two or three
of them may be expected to put more dash and
breadth into their performances forthwith, but it
is unlikely that a harmonious tout ensemble can
ever obtain under present circumstances. Gour-
lay plays the principal husband in a comical yet
altogether uncanny style, too much like that of a
genteel clown out of pantomime. The method is
irreconcileable with anybody else’s. His red wig,
stage voice, facial make-up, and tragic comedy
incline to the supernatural, and are distinctly out
of touch with modern civilisation. Brough would
put a far happier construction on the same part.
Maggie Moore, as the leading wife, is fast tpning
herself down to light comedy requirements,
and manages to make a partial success, but
Maggie Knight and Hans Phillips infuse very
little life into the minor married couple.
The monotony of Royce’s gutturals doesnt
dim his popularity, as the drivelling old retainer,
whilst Snazelle seems likely to hit the mark after
a little more practice in the major character. He
started brightly enough on Saturday (in fact, the
whole first act was well, if slowly, played), but
missed his chances as time went on. A conviction
that his trousers were braced up six inches above
the normal level seemed to settle upon Snazzy s
soul and haunt his hilarity, until at last his talent
became small and insignificant as compared with
his boots. Nobody appeared to the manper of
the comedy born, with the one exception of Edwin
Kelly, who realised the fleeting character of
Nicholson’s lawyer with a tender care and delicate
humour that naturally had no charms for the
gallery. The quiet excellence of Kelly s acting,
a perfect concealment of art by art, was a treat
which very few seemed to appreciate. “The Late
Lamented” will scarcely last until “ The Merry
Duchess ” is ready to tune up. Yet there is real
grit in this show—mostly under the surface.
“Jane” is making very good wages at Melbourne
Bijou, and the place suits her, Jane’s place is as
unconventional as herself. She is parlour-maid to
a young bachelor in “rooms” where a man-
servant is kept. The bachelor, being a gay, reck-
less dog, doesn’t come home oftener than once a
fortnight, presumably, so one can t marvel that
William and Jenny should fill up the spare mean-
time by falling in love. William, we imagine,
can stand on the mat outside Jane’s door and sing
of his affections all through the livelong night,
without “master,” away on the razzle-dazzle,
being any wiser. A couple so situated would
naturally drift into matrimony. The reputation
of the “ rooms ” demands that fatal step. Pattie
Browne might be a less melo-dramatic adopted
parent of the rag-baby, but her general briskness
atones for much that is open to criticism, and the
damsel comes off triumphant in all respects.
Brough’s conception of the sat-upon spouse grows
more airy, Anson is the most gloriously insane
uncle that ever accepted a sham pledge of a flec-
tion, and the others help to make “Jane roll
along like an earthquake. No change for another
week or two. ,

The absence of prima-donna Guidotti,
through sickness, has made itself painfully felt m
“ Les Huguenots ” at Melbourne Alexandra.
Madame Boema, the substitute in an all-important
character, seems to fish for her most difficult
notes, and they are not particularly fine when
landed. Nor does Madame fill the billet satis-
factorily in any other respect. The mischance
which has so marred this production of Meyer-
beer’s masterpiece is the more regrettable, because
of the evident intention to have ma_de_ it a first-
class entertainment. The fair Matioli is a nice
young queen, and Vilalta generally gets there
with his tenor music in the face of difficulties
with a strange soprano. Travaglini and lons,
the bassi, come well through heavy tasks, also,
Sisco and Signorina Oavalleri appear quite at
their best. As for the musical forces under the
accomplished Napoleon, they are now in grand
condition, and even the mounting is not to be
snorted at. The Cutticas were to appear again
in “Lucia” on Wednesday, to-night (Thursday)
sees the last of “ Les Huguenots,” and on x nday,
good old “Rigoletto” will bring his histromc
hump to the front.

The Opera House is “ resting” with closed

Fred Belton used to relate, in Sydney, one of his early
London static experiences, with Mrs. Honey, the Nellie
Barren of her day. He had not long been married, and
was acting with her in the “Middy Ashore, where she
impersonated the Middy. She had to dress on top of a
flight of stairs, and implored him to carry her down, be-
cause she was afraid some of the bolt-ropes might give
way,
Madame Simonsen says the “Huguenots isa queeily
unlucky opera. Last season her Madame Cmti fell ill,
and she had herself to do Valentine, and this season Mdlle
Guidotti falls hoarse, and Boema has to be fetched tor
Valentine. But “Ernani” has from all time been re-
garded as the most luckless opera in Melbourne.
Melba is having her stage dresses built by Worth, of
Paris. And, bv the way, a London paper claims Melba
and Alhani as “two English artists.;’ Imperial
English, we presume, seeing that one is an Australian
and the other comes from Canada.
' Poor Win Robins, who plays the leading lady’s part in
the new London play “The Trumpet Call, had an
unpleasant experience on the first night. She has to
make a quick change of costume, but in the hurry o
dressing did not fasten her dress very securely. The
result was that, during a most pathetic scene, her skirt
became undone and down it dropped. Unluckily her
under-garments were few, she wore no petticoats in
point of fact she had nothing on but her “combinations,
so there she was facing the audience, winch, of course
set up a yell. It was an awtul moment, but the lady
preserved her sangfroid, and quietly pulled up her skirt,
fastened it and went on with the scene, amidst cheers,
as if nothing had happened. The next evening Beve-
ridsre before going on the stage, knocked at the lady s
dressing-room door and said, “Oh, Win Robins, are you
going to play this evening the same business you did
last night?”
Alfred Cellier comes to Australia for a rest. He unfor-
tunately suffers from lung-disease.

A Sydney pressman recently received the following
polite epistle: “Dear Sir,-After some difficulty I have
ascertained that you are the contributor to the C
n theatrical column. A paragraph came under my
notice in last week’s issue, containing some remarks of a
personal character against a valued friend of mine (Miss
n ) Now, let me tell you this—that unless you insert
a few’words stating that the remarks were intended in a
locular strain, and not to be insulting, I shall take an
early opportunity of thrashing you m some public place. I
expect to see the apology, if not in this week s issue, at
any rate in that of the following.” How enviable is the
position of dramatic critic !

At Melbourne Bijou they have spoilt the amphitheatre

earlv door. Your shilling playgoer, backbone of the shop,
is always persecuted by the dodge of giving him a pen too
small, to squeeze an extra coin out of him Why not
give ’em heaps of room, as at the London East End .
Whv should the opera orchestra be forced to wear even'
intr dress when the play orchestra isn’t ? It is not as if
the orchestra was elevated on the stage. Comes as a
hardship on the Musical Union, and is a mere London and
Parisian figment.
The ouera staging, Melbourne Alexandra, is shockingly
bad. Compare Lyster’s “ Huguenots,” of 30 years ago. A
novelty is the cow ballet. There ought to be a bullock-
bell accompaniment.
Good old Benham is on the pit side door at the Mel
bourne Opera. Sighs over the “Huguenots, as the Rip

yet there. .
There has been a bit of newspaper paragraphing about
Henrv Irving’s loss of voice, all of which, no doubt, was
in the interests of that Prince of Cheap Advertisers
Morell Mackenzie. As a matter of fact Irving suffers
from a very slight affection of the uvula, which is apt to
enlarge with any sudden change of weather, and it has
been Considered advisable to use the knife This has
been magnified into “a delicate and difficult operation,
performed with much skill by that eminent specialist
s’j.. M m ” etc. The fact is that the operation is of the
simplest kind, and was performed on the writer by
Lennox Browne without any fuss or bother. All Browne
said was, “Now off you go, don t catch cold, and don t
drink spirits for - 24 hours.’
NR S. Smythe now calls himself “the Moltke or
managers.” This, now that he has Monsieur Max O Rell
in tow, simply won’t do.
The Much-Travelled writes that he has liquored up
with Irving, at a side table, and asked for the Great
Henry’s views respecting an Australian tour. Irving s
views were hazy and uncertain, apparently.

One or two of the Adelaide critics were lately complain-

as“a set-off against a previous protest that he lacked fire.
However, business-which is the only critic worth
troubling about—gave Alfred favourable notices all the
time.
Drury Lane will hold about £575 at ordinary puces.
Melbourne Royal people have tried to persuade the
Rio-nolds to open in something with more human in-
terest and backbone than “The Merry Wives. The
brethren however, think that a good Falstaff is a sure
attraction for three or four weeks, and very likely they
are right.
It has puzzled everyone-the non-success of “ Lady
Bountiful ” (says our London correspondent). It is one
of the sweetest plays ever written, was beautifully acted,
and needless to say, superbly mounted, and yet the
public hold aloof and could not be induced to look at it.
Is this a sign of the decadence of taste ? People flocked
to see “ Sweet Lavender,” yet this play, which is not the
same genre , fails to attract. All the while that rubbishy
drama, “The English Rose,” drew enormous houses.
In the new Adelphi drama by G. R. Sims and Robert
Buchanan there is a church-scene so suspiciously like the
scene of Lydgate Old Church in “Lady Bountiful” that
the critic of the Daily Telegraph drew attention to the
coincidence. Even the incident, an interrupted mar-
riage, is the same. Of his own accord Mr. Pinero has
come forward to acquit the authors of “The Trumpet
Call”—which is the title of the Adelphi play—of plagiar-
ism. Mr. Pinero states that immediately after the pro-
duction of “ Lady Bountiful ” at the Garrick, Mr. Sims
wrote to him and stated that a church-scene with a mar-
riage incident formed part of the story of the play upon
which he and Buchanan were then engaged. This makes
the coincidence all the more remarkable. In his letter to
the D.T. Pinero writes: “In justice to my friend, Mr.
G. R. Sims, and to Mr. Robert Buchanan.” Why this
distinction? Is not the aggressive Robert “a friend” of
Pinero’s?
Felix Tanner, who lives on an empty stomach, is going
to challenge Succi and Jacques to fast for the champion-
ship of the world. Tanner, by the way, had an all-round
shrinkage in Adelaide. He lost 36 lbs. in weight, 6 inches
round the chest, 7 inches round the centre, and his
banking account receded several inches.
On Thursday last, the fourth anniversary of He.i
Majesty’s opening, George Rignold gave “Jim” Hazlitt,

in the wings and be able to ring up to the second.”

few viveurs in the immediate vicinity of the pair,

many extolling the virtues of Marshall’s Tonic
Nervine, I think I should, unsolicited, add my

have invariably found that a bottle of this in-
estimable tonic has brought relief.—Yours faith-
fully, William H. Steadman.
Francis Adams, in the Fortnightly, on
Australian bushmen ;
Behold this native-born Australian of the interior, o*
the first and second generations, sullen and sombre-
souled, everlastingly confronting a hostile sun, his
digestion ruined with an endless stream of tannin (he
calls it tea), a spare eater, a spare drinker, pre-
cociously and neurotically amorous, biliously and satani-
cally proud, able to shoot rabbits and birds with a rifle,
and to sit any horse yet born from morning to night. He
cares so little for the curse of existence that on occasion
he will grinningly throw away his life for a trifle. When
he begins to blow or to swear his drawling words, super-
human lies, or face-whipping curses come out of him in
one long, nervous spasm. The English condemnatory
volubility is utterly gone. His generosity is reckless in'
its extremity. Touch his heart, and he tends you in your
hour of sickness like a woman in love. It is not for
nothing that one lives in desperate drought-land on
mutton, tannin and unspeakable damper.

POLITICAL POINTS
Mr. Houghton, M.P., has tabled a Motion
for a plebiscite oil the N;S.W. fiscal question;
Disraeli: “The struggle to come, ill
England, is between National and Cosmopolitan
principles.”
Central Australia n; Nick Willis's' Boiitke
paper; has a heading—“Odf Membet dll the
Job.” Candid;
S. A; Savings Bank lias ; 1’d,03(5 depositors:,
ilith aggregate deposits of *2,158,227. This
averages £2B 17s;
Preiniei’ Parkes, too 1 exhausted to sit dut
the ordinary sessions of N.S.W. Assembly, desires
the House td sit also on Mondays.
Dr. Cockburn’s speech in H A. Assembly
on his motion for ministers to be appointed by the
House was due of the ablest efforts of his Parlia-
mentary career.
Political economy in brief: Every man
according to his greed. Socialism : Every mail
according to his deed. Communism : Every man
according to his need.
!H.A. Register: —“ The high standard of
life among its population is. of more consequence
to Australia than the rate of profit, which land-
owners can raise from its soil.”
It is a sad sight to see how many semi-
paralysed members totter, shuffle or slide into the
N.S.W. Upper House. We mean it is a sad sight
for a so-called democratic country.
B- D. Morehead : “ I am a freetrader and
will remain one as long as I live.” Sir T.
MThvraith ‘‘ As long as it suits you.” Quondam
mates, and they know each other.
Graham Berry is “coming back into Vic-
torian politics. He might as well save himself
the trouble. He cannot hope to succeed as an
tion de hereof Paddysmarketaria.
When the Commonwealth Bill was debated
in tiie Tasmanian House of Assembly, the House,
to a man, indignantly scouted Parkes’ impudent
personal pretensions with reference to Federation.
The N.S.W. Assembly have altered that
clause in Parkes’ clumsy, ill-worded, verbose
People’s Representation Pill, which authorised a
Retnrning-officer, after he was dead, to appoint a
deputy.
Whde Attorney-General Simpson and
Vice-President Suttor have special chairs at the
table of the N.S.W. Legislative Council, the other
Government representative, P.M.G. O’Connor,
takes a back seat.
The elders of theN.Z, Upper House threw
out (by a majority of two) the Woman’s Suffrage
Pill which the gallant Commons of Maoriland
tuul agreed to by a majority of 25, the voting
having been 33 to 8.
There are 84,397 voters’ names on the
Queensland electoral rolls, besides which 14,968
fresh claimants have applied for registration since
the beginning of this year. Another 685 and up
goes the total to 100,000.
Parkes may patronisingly call his Minister
of Education “ Little Busybody,” but Oarruthers
regards himself as the coming N.S.W. Premier
for all that. You smile ! Well, someone must be
Premier when Parkes goes.
Hume: “There is no abuse so great as
not to be attended with a variety of beneficial
circumstances, and in the beginnings of reforma-
tion the loss of these is always felt, while the
benefits are the slow effects of time.”
As Mr. Justice Foster (N.S.W.) is going
to Europe on sick leave, it is understood “up
King-street” that Attorney-General Simpson will
take an Acting-Judgeship with “contingent
remainder,” and Mr. Edmund Barton, Q.C., is to
have the Chief Law Officership.
In Brisbane is said that the whips on both
sides have strict orders to guard the Coalition
Government against a defeat in any of the
guerilla attacks of Labour-men Glassey and
Hoolan or of the discontented ex-Speaker Groom,
perpetual member for Toowoomba.
Dilke makes much of Earl Grey's pre-
science in attempting, in ’49, to provide for a
Federal Assembly of Australia. But if Dilke
chooses to remember so much, don’t let Australians
forget that had Grey had his wish the Australian
would have been convict dependencies to-day.
In 1848-9 the Launceston Examiner
(Tas.), in a series of articles which bear internal
evidence of having been written by the Rev. John
West, afterwards editor of the Sydney Morning
Herald (!), advocated for the Australias separa-
tion from Great Britain and annexation to the
United States.
Dear Bulletin, —l think I may as well,
let you know now that the inventor of the term
'* Commonwealth,” as applied to Australia, was
neither Parkes nor Deakin, but—who do you
think? No other than that dear, devoted, all-
wool patriot, John Macarthur. The evidence is
extant. More anon ! — Price Waruxg.
“ J he one-mau-ohe-billet” rule will shortly
be recommended to the favourable notice of the
cretary to the N.S.W. Civil Service Board. He
draws £<>oo in that soft billet, and about £4OO in
the equally soft billet of secretary to the Civil
per vice Commission. He is erroneously supposed
by many widows Of civil servants to be the
board.
Mayor Cohen, M.P., “ working-man’s
representative,” gave himself away very badly the
other day at the local labor demonstration. Said
he : “ This is the fifth occasion on which I have
attended the celebration, arid if, as I hope to, I
bpntinue to retail! the confidence df North
Adelaide electorate, I will probably attend the
gathering for years to come.”
Every novfr arid fcheri a loyal idiot,
deceased, leaves a sum of money to a reigning
monarch, because he or she is a, reigning monarch.
A. -E rench marquis has just bequeatlied two
million francs to the Corate de Paris, on the
ground that lie would be a monarch if they gave
Him his tights; It’s hard to be compelled to draw
ori one’s imagination for a royal legatee.
This. N.S.W. Opposition decided iri dances
td arraign Hindle, M.P., before the House in ton-
sequence of his having stated at Parramatta that
though d riumbet of landboomers arid mining
bdodlets had been swept out df the Assembly
yet, unfortunately; a few remained; But Hindle,
iristead of being bluffed, rejoiced at the about-to-.
be afforded opportunity fdr exposure; and so the
tliihg fizzled out;
1/. L. Smith asks the Victorian Assembly
to look with suspicion upon the utterances (scrri-
tinise the accents as they fall) df the member for
A NARROW ESCAPE.
SHE : “My sister Charlotte was born on the Ist. of January, I was born, on the 4th., and
my sister Clara was born on the eighth.
HE: “Why good gwatious you were neawaly twiplets.”
Warrnambool (Jack Murray), because he has
“already declared himself a Republican.” But
Smith—to give that loyal cockney creature his due
—didn’t make this damaging announcement until
Murray had told him he knew as little about a
breakwater as he knew about physio.
A sign of the times is the fact that
Minister Garruthers (N.S.W.) is showing people
how all Yass belongs to one old lady, and that at
Goulburn and at Peel River 400' miles of
land and 54 miles of water frontage be-
long to an English, firm that had not a single
shareholder living in the province. Also that
in the Illawarra district the same state of things
existed, and that an enormous estate belonged to
two absentee Englishmen.
B. R. Wise's amending Bill imposing
municipal taxation on the unimproved value only
of land has set the N.S.W. property-holders by
the ears. A “ Suburban Alderman ” —probably a
member of the Single-Tax League, for the Single-
taxers run in all .shapes and under all sorts of
names—in the S.M. Herald, calls upon “all who
have a stake in this great land, and have at heart
the progress of this noble country,” to sit on such
rascality.
Tom Glassey, Labour member, the other
day elicited from the Queensland Minister for
Lands that the Isis Downs run comprised 297
square miles of country which had been leased for
21 years, from January 1886, at a rental of fd.
per acre. That is to say, at £2 a square mile, or
for the whole of the immense area only £504 a
year, with a monopoly of 21 years, and the chance
of buying up “ the eyes ” of tile coluitry at the
lowest possible price.
Ex-President GrevV was always the
people’s friend, though his son-in-law, Wilson,
ruined him. Grcvy sprang into notice even over
the Revolution of 1830, Charles X’s, when his
principles were identical with those that marked
him in 1880. In 1848 lie was again to the fore,
arid did all he could to spoil Louis Napoleon’s
game, wherefore he was only heard of again after
Sedati and Metz, when he became President of
Assembly, then President of the Republic.
Sir Joiin Bray, the present S;A. Cllie*

Queenslarid sugar-plantations are to be guaranteed
tAo years’work, at 11s. per Week for the first
year, and 12s. per Week for the second ; rations
per Week for each riian—l2lb. of beef or mutton,
31b. rice, 51b. flour or 71b. bread, 21b. sugar. Alb.
coffee and Alb. salt. What is this but slavery ?—its
object the degradation of the white man who was
not bred on riiaocaroni ? Are visions about, or
are these things really happening under the rule
1 °
of the virtuous Sir Sham Griffith, who so nobly
objected to South Sea blackbirding?
The Colonial Sugar Co. is importing 500
Javanese to work its Goondi plantation, near
Geraldton, N.Q. About 18 months ago, a mere
handful of Javanese up there made a determined
figh t against the authorities, and as the total
armed force of the district is two constables, one
of whom is always absent on escort-duty, a rising
of 500 Javanese, in addition to those already on
the ground, would give the white men in the
district no end of trouble. These Javanese are
under a 3-years’ engagement, at 6s. 3d. per week
and rations !
King Billy, of the Macleay River, N S.W.,
now deceased, upon being asked what he must
liked in all the world replied : “Oh glassa rum,
my word!” “Now suppose you had the rum
what else would you like ? ” “ Bit bacca, I dhink.”
Being further interrogated as to wliat desire he
would next wish to gratify, Billy scratched his
head and replied : “Nudther glassa rum ray
pinny word.” This puts the whole nigger-vote
question into a nutshell. The nigger doesn’t want
a vote. He only wants rum and bacca. And
then more rum, and then some more bacca unto
seventy times seven.
On one Queensland run, 20,000 acres have
been selected at 10s. per acre. Treasurer
MTlwraith’s stone-broke policy is to sell cheaply
big areas to land-gobblers, and the colonists may
expect to see agents for secret syndicates acquiring
all the finest Queensland areas which the said
syndicates will afterwards absorb and hold to the
detriment of hona-fide men working for their oivfi
families. And MTlwraith’s estimate of the
year’s land-tevenue will probably be as far out
Were his calculations of his famous
tive, r/uasi-revenue tariff of 1888.
There are two Mackenzies in the Madfi-
land Legislature who hate each other with a dark
bloodthirsty, piratical hatred. Therefore, wheh
the Hansard officials sent the proofs of a speech
to the wrong Mackenzie by mistake, he waded in
to blast the other mail’s character for evermore
The things He made the other Mackenzie saV
that speech were calculated, had they been pub-
lished, to make hirii a thing of loathing and ah
Object of public scorn. Then at the last moment
the right Mackenzie got the proof, and when he
saw what he was alleged to have said his rage ivas
of a kind that only blood could appease.
Having declared recently that the Opposi-
tion was responsible for the time expended in
N. S. Wales Parliament in committee over the
“People’sßepresentation Bill,” the S.M. Herald
the other day somersaulted in a leader, ahd
ehaeavbiired to put the entire blame on the
shoulders of the Labour-party. Had the Herald
honestly desired to expose the culpable individual
it Would have stated that the Premier who intro-
duced such a crude, bomplbx and ill-constructed
measure to the House was solely responsible.
Palkes never had any constructive genius or any
capacity for selecting subordinates it) possession
of the faculties lacking in himself.
Mitchelson, M.P., of Maorilaud, has got
about the surest seat in all Australasia. The last
three men who ventured to contest his consti-
tuency all died by violence almost immediately
afterwards—two of them by suicide—and now
anybody who wants to live gives Mitchelson a
walk-over. The two suicided individuals both
went the same way; a blight, or a curse, or a car-
buncle seemed to come over them immediately
after the election, and they pined away, and went
mad, and then they softly deposited their brains
on the floor and died. Still even Mitchelson can't
last for ever. Some day, we suppose, he will lose
his seat, and then he will probably hang himself
on the door-knob in the Parliamentary refresh-
ment-room, and the tragedy will be finished.
It is stated by certain enemies of the
N.S.W. Labour-party, that in one of the Sydney
city electoral labour leagues, several hundred
members voted by ballot for the nomination of
a certain bunch. The ballot-papers were ap-
parently 0.K., but when an effort was made by
post to collect the “ sustentation ” fees, only
about 100 living members of the league could be
found. The votes received by post, which deter-
mined the choice of candidates, were those of
absent men, dead men and myths. The rolls, in
fact, had been stuffed, and there can, of course,
be no identification of the ballot-papers, when all
the free and independent voted anonymously per
mail. And similarly in regard to another elec-
torate.
Gillies lured the Victorian Government
into a tight place the other night, and then crept
silently away to revel in his saponaceous smile.
It was at Duncan's instigation that Premier
Munro enlarged a schedule of proposed expendi-
ture on public buildings, with the result that
many of the “ins” voted against the amended
list, whilst only a few of the “ outs ” were included
in the Government’s narrow majority. Deakin
and Pearson (be it noted) supported Munro’s
inane attempt at pleasing the other side, but
Dow, Wrixon and J. B. Patterson voted as hard
as they could against their own policy of twelve
months ago. _ Gillies supported neither side, but
simply remained true to his secret principles.
When_ the muffin-bell rang the leader of the
< )pposition was numbered with the missing. He
had retired to some far off pub. for a drop of Scotch
whisky and a snigger. It was a fair average
illustration of how the old and artful variety of
politician serves his country.

.\fter a long and desperate struggle with

The editor of the Tasmanian Ohur.ru
News (a High Church Anglican clergyman)
calmly asks his readers to furnish for the benefit
of a correspondent some clue to the authorship ot
“Eceo Homo,” and, information as to the, char-

Church when such mammoth ignorahee and wilful
perversity exists atoong its leaders ?
G. B. Barton and Frank Hutchinson were
named by Halley as tile litterateurs to whom, in
conjunction, and if not so arranged-, separately,
the work of compiling his memoirs was to be
entrusted. It is understood that only the inagni-
ficent ideas entertained concerning literary re-
muneration by the man who holds the bag, pre-
vents Halley’s wish being acted upon.
Randolph Churchill’s highly - paid : for
letters from South Africa to the Daily Graphic
are ghastly productions. ' They are neither clever
nor amusing. G. R. Sims says he is prepared to
wager the cost of the letters that more people take
an interest in the umbrella of the weather Sibyl,
whose effigy appears on the front page of the
paper, than they do in Randy’s lucubrations.
Edward Davy Harrop, manager of the
L unices ton (Tas. j branch of the Commercial Bank
of that island, whose signature is familiar vvliere-

barring Henry Gyles Turner, the most literary ot
colonial financiers. He read and remembered
everything.
Prince Ferdinand, late of Bulgaria, is still
undecided about marrying his sister’s daughter,
lies afraid their characters may be too much
alike, and 'then there’s a tradition in this family

The powerful .conception df assassination
by discharging a squirt-full of anhydrous acid
against the breast of the .victim, which .forms the
central motive of D. Christie Murray and Henry
Herman’s novel, “He (Fell Among J liieves, is
certainly not original to the authors. Percy K.
Meggy, the Secretary of the late N.S. \*. .Labour
•Commission, used the .idea in a curious stretch,
-“The History of a Shriek,” .published m a
Bathurst paper three-years ago.
Nicholas John Brown, the now Tasmanian
Speaker, won’t wear a wig-—not that he .objects
to the ornament itself so much as to .being shorn
>of the luxuriant and much-cherished clusters of
gold and silver curls .which droop around bus
leonine head. The superb, full-bottomed wig w
which Ex-Speaker Keibey used to deliver his
impressively solemn rulings is now used as a
scarecrow on his Entally estate.
“ Captain " Audley Coote, once well-
known as mate of a Sydney-Brisbane -steamer,
and now a member, of Tasmania’s Legislative
Council, got fooling with a policeman-in-plam-
clothes for his handcuffs, believing the “ blue-
bottle ”to be an impostor. “Bobby” closed the
spring, and Coote and he had.to walk a mile or so
to the nearest station ere they could get them
unlocked, Bobby having “lost the key !”—so he
said.
A Melbourne reporter “ interviewed” olid
rif the captains who was mixed up in theGambier-
Easby collision, and made that seaman in
his repott, that when the accident occurred ne
put his trust iri Providence.” And now the
captain is going about like a bag or lions, and
contradicting the statement in powerful language;
He says most distinctly that he didn t put nis
trust in Providence, either then or at any other
time, and ho wants to thrash the mart who said
he did.
R J. M'Cullocli, the newly-appointed
judge of the Victorian Racing Club, has an
unrivalled memory. When the writer first met
him.(in a newspaper-office years ago) JVI. Culiocti
sat clown ;at 10 o’clock at night, to write
for the mottling publication an extended re-
port* bf a.. race-meeting, describing in detail
the movements of the horses in every race,
which teat he accomplished in an admittedly
accurate and satisfactory way without a note ot
any kind. And so with a coursing-meetmg

Phil. May is now universally recognised
as being in the top rank of the world’s great black-
and-white artists, who may be numbered on the
fingers Of one’s hands. His success in Europe is
only bounded by Ins health, which is uncertain.
An Australian lately-returned from England saw
a letter addressed to May by the editor ot the
Graphic, who, alluding to some of Phil s sketches,
said that he “had seen nothing which had im-
pressed him so much since his poor friend, Calde-
cott, first astonished them all.
The man who contributed (from Loudon)
to the Melbourne Agk bis reminiscences of Poet
Gordon’s last hours —which account knocked the
bottom out of Patchett Martin’s version is
George Collins Levey, formerly editor of that one-
time radical sheet. Levey was, perhaps still is, a
glutton at garnished language. W hen the formes
were late, the talk between Levey and Blaekham,
overseer of the Aop printers, was just beautiful. it
sounded as though 20 S. Y. Winters were around
witli their own patent vocabularies of Original
and Unadorned Objurgation.
The “ Jayuil ” is not the only Dan
O’Connor in Australia. Rev. Father O'Connor,
of Wexford, Ireland, who has been collecting
funds in Australia towards the rebuilding of his
ancient parish church, has also been looking for
his long-separated brother, Daniel of that ilk,
whom he the other day discovered in the person
of the barman of the Cambrian Hotel, Mary-
borough, Vic. They had not met for 33 years .
We are here tempted to remark that if lather
O’Connor hadn’t met Dan in charge of the pub.
he would have found him in charge of the police-
station. _ _
John Alger, of Alger’s wharf, Sydney, is,
like George Thornton, of somewhat uncertain age.
Ear back, in the fifties, he was a sort of standing
dish at parties. It was the custom 111 those primi-
tive davs to propose toasts at supper, and John,
like George Reid to-day, was always called upon
to return thanks for the ladies. To look at the
old fellow now with his hoary beard, one can
hardly realise the fact that he was ever a smart
ladies’ man. One of his daughters was married,
the other day, to a man with a donble-baxreUeal
name —manager of a branch bank at Rensington
(London.)
In a Southern province, the grandson of a
.Commander of the Forces (colonial) is a working
miner, and the foreman of his shift is a son of a
Rear-Admiral; a chain-man in a neighbouring
surveyor’s gang is a grandson of a former Governor,
and a boat hand on the steamer which brings
supplies to the mine is a first cousin of the present
Governor of another Australian province, while
the caretaker in the boat’s-office at the home port
is the eighth son of another Governor. Every
man Jack of the lot had, at one time, an indepen-
dent income, and every one has “ dossed” in
No. 2 Boiler, Cole’s Wharf, or similar institutions.
Let us not sneer at Monaco or its prince,
who has alonger pedigree than any other potentate,
great or petty, in Europe. Fqr more than eight
centuries the title passed down a direct line qf
males. It was net until 1731 that a daughter qf
the house had to -take up ,the running, and ,tbe
present Prince is her great grandson. A revolu-
tion in the little Principality would cause thirty
.deceased .sovereigns, all .of the same blood, qr
politely supposed Jo have been, Jo tqrn in their
coffins There never was such another family for
nursing the same old billet from generation to
generation. No idea of work has coursed through
.their delicate blue veins for ; a thousand years.
Mac Somebody, editor of a Launqestqp
,(Tas.,) daily, has the strong weakness of being too
fond of thrusting Ins personality and his office
into the public eye. He was a witness t'other
day at the inquest on the body qf young Hall,
the Sydney defaulter, and in the report the oppo-
sition paper simply described him as a “ journa-
list » Next time he met the reporter, be taxed
that note-taker with refusing him the honours of
his position. “ Well, aren't you a journalist ?”
Which reminds one ,pf the story told ot Words-
worth .when staying at Patterdaje. I rank Mar-
shall, then a child, was sent out into the garden
to call Wordsworth in to supper, ami said, Your
wife wants you.” “My boy,” said Wqrdsworth,
“.you should say ‘ Mrs. Wordsworth,’ .not your
wife •’ ” The boy replied,■“ She,is your,wife, isn t
she ?'” The poet’s reply is not given.

The same skd, sorrowful* old story; ThO
ollief sufferers in the Bank of Van Diemen’s
Land smash are lone widows, poor orphans, ahd
impoverished old ladies, and this while certain
high officials and particular pets were allowed to
overdraw to the tune of £lO,OOO, £20,000, and even
up to £52,000!

A Waiter of the Australia iJotel, questioned
as to Sara’s alleged marriage with Darmont, said,
sagely—“ Well, we didn’t know of it, and you’d
think a thing like that would leak out somehow—
but, mind yet; there Was a terrible lot of priests
hanging round her for the last day or two before
she sailed.'’ It looks as though the interesting
event came off. Sara would naturally require a
terrible lot of priests to prepare her for a rentree
into the married state.

Yachts are expensive things to keep.
Even the solid millionaires of .Sydney dabble

A lot of fuss is being made over the case
of Barnett, or Burnett, the ricketiy Sydney crank
who, after being ordered to gaol for three years
for indecent offences, was released (on an official
medical certificate that he had heait-and-lung
disease and couldn’t live long) only to commit
similar offences again. But who ever heard
more than a whisper about the release of
the wealthy Petersham (Sydney) alderman
who got seven years for forging the name of
a dead man, and a year or so afterwards was
seen calmly driving round in a nobby buggy
behind a spanking trotter ? It is averred, by the
way, that prior to his release —on what ground
it was assented to has never been stated —that
municipal magnate parted £lOOO to a denomi-
nationally-controlled charitable institution.

The objection urged on behalf of the public
to the hearing of the divorce-cases in camera,
remindsus of at leastonecelebrated Australian case
which was heard in open couit, notwithstanding
the position of the parties. Sir Robert Moles-
worth, Judge of the Supreme Court cf Victoria,
sought a divorce from his wife (both now dead) in
consequence of her alleged misconduct with,
amongst others, the late R. D. Ireland, Q.C. A
good deal of the case was mere suspicion, and
although tried before a “brother Judge” the
petitioner did not succeed. Dawson, who appeared
for Mrs. Molesworth, was unsparing in his satire
on the old Judge. J. D. Wood, who appeared for
Ireland, asked his client, in the witness-box, if
“on his honour,” he ever had any criminal
intimacy with Mrs. Molesworth. “Dick” placed
his palm over the region of his heart, and with
great solemnity declared “on his honour ” that he
never had. J. D. Wood is the only one now left
who took part in the case.

A certain lawyer who contested a N.S.W,
constituency at last general election went to the
women’s type-writing rooms and offered them all
his work if they would give him 50 per shent dis-
count — i.e., if they would write for a penny
a folio (twopence being the usual rate). The
affronted typists vow that they will make it hot
for that lawyer should he ever again dare to lift
up his voice on a public platform.

Labour-delegate Dyson (N.S.W.) is of
opinion that barmaids are “either too proud or
too debased ” to help themselves, and can never be
unionised. lie thinks they should be abolished ;
During floocltime Condobolin (N.S.W.)
suffered several kinds of famine. The township
rations ran low and slush-lamps were the order of
the night. But “the most unkindest cut of all ”
was that the Condobolin fays ran out of hairpins,
and the local blacksmith was favoured with orders
to make patent skewers out of fencing-wire.

Dear Bulletin, — He your doggerel on the
loquaciousness of Chinese wives and the conse-
quent penalty. There is a tribe of blacks in the
Northern Territory of S.A. who do not allow
their women to speak at all after marriage. This
law is strictly enforced, and obeyed, but I do not
know the penalty incurred by disobedience. The
gins above a certain age all converse by means of
signs. This tribe occupies the dry country
between the heads of the coast rivers running into
the Gulf and those falling inland, a sort of
debateable land between the coast and the in-
terior. In the ear ier days of the overland
telegraph-line an old man and his gin
came in to Powell Creek station and
were allowed to stay there. They got some
rations and a little tobacco, which they soon
learned to use, and did the usual blackfellow’s
work of bringing up the horses and milkers.
Nothing could induce the gin to utter a word. As
an experiment, her ra’ions and tobacco were
stopped, but it availed not. Tin n they stopped
the old man’s rations, and at last his tobacco.
This was too much for him, and ho sternly com-
manded her to speak. She did so : she turned on
her husband, and belaboured him with all the
long-pent curtain-lectures of years, all the bottled-
up abuse that should have been doled out in
instalments was paid in full. Next she went for
t;ie station-master, and then for all hands, wind-
ing up with the Chinese cook, who encountered
her valiantly in Chinese, and the two went at it for
hours. Finally, as she could not be stepped, she
had to be cast out, like a second Hagar, into the
wilderness. The aboriginal plan works well so
long as the rule is not infringed.— Delcomyn.

The Bulletin earnestly recommends the
foregoing facts to the attention of the Australian
women’s literary and debating societies.
The N.S.W. memorial to the late sculler
Searle, champion of the world, which was ordered
some time ago from some foreign country or other,
is about to be landed in N.S.W,, so that we shall
soon hear about an unveiling ceremony. A fig
for your public memorials ! After all the gush
and blather, they have not up to date raised quite
£lOOO as a memorial towards the chair of language
which is (or ought to be) established at Sydney
University in remembrance of bluff old Jack
Robertson. And how about the Dailey memorial,
concerning which there was such a flourish of
trumpets? And is Henry Kendall’s memorial yet
paid for? And how many years did they take to
raise a metal effigy of old Doctor Lang? Most of
our “ public memorials ” are gross shams. Look,
for instance, at one of the latest, the statue raised
at Melbourne to cranky Gordon, the demented
higger-slayer of the goUdah ! What does that
represent ? The nation’s appreciation of the
alleged virtues of the departed monomaniac? No !
If it really and truly represents anything more
than an advertising fake of a little Imperialistic
mutual - advertising society in and around- the
Argus newspaper office we should like to know.

The latest tumour about the Sydney daily
looming Protectionist paper, alleged to be (this is a
Very cautious paragraph) projected, is that it is to
be run chiefly by Victorians ahd with Victorian
capital. This somehow reminds one of the un-
happy first days of the Sydney Daily Telegraph,
Which was manned exclusively by Victorian re-
porters, who used, especially late at night, to write
about the “ Yarra” when they meant the Parra-
matta.

We crane our mental necks across the sea
in joyous expectancy of the new book, Sir Ber-
nard Burke’s “Colonial Gentry” Baronet
Clarke, son of rich Butcher Clarke and
so on. Is Parkes a gent ? Is Berry ? Is
Gillies ? London Daily News already
slashes up this nauseous muck. Wentworth
refused the baronetcy because he wanted to
be Lord Vaucluse. Sir Salmon Wilson gave
£40,000 to Melbourne University for a peerage,
which never came. But we may yet witness
an apotheosis of the podgy-raan with the flame-
coloured whiskers. His son (the umbrella
hero), it is cabled, is to marry a daughter (broken-
mouthed) of the late Duke of Marlborough. Thus
.will be united the two illustrious houses of the
hero of Blenheim and King Alfred the Great.

Verbatim extract from speech delivered at
the N.S.W. Art Society’s dinner, the other night,
about one a.m. : “ You talk about Lord Jersey as
a Governor ; my Gord, you say he’s the best we
ever had ; my Gord, I don’t think so; my Gord
no; I’ve known plenty of Governors, my Gord,
heaps of ’em, and they all said to me, my

and the sneaker and audience wobbled out into
the strept, fell down three times, and found them-
selves on their own door-steps.

The A.N.A. is doomed. It appears that
the champion goal-kicker of Victoria was born in

In St. Kilda (Melb.) Cemetery there is a
touching tombstone showing above the inscription
a design, in slight relief, of a hand holding a jug
at the angle one likes to see it held at on a warm
day. The stone was erected by a Mrs. to the
memory of her late husband, who kept a pub. and
was cut down like a flower in the act of filling a
jug of beer. _ He had just finished putting a head
on it with his right arm, “ the strong arm,” when
the awful summons came, and the beer, presum-
ably, began to slip from his nerveless grasp as
depicted on the tombstone.

Fourteen new names were added lately to
the roll of N.S.W. solicitors, which now numbers
considerably more than 600. Law is a very pay-
able industry if managed properly. Five leading
legal firms in Sydney net between £lO,OOO and
£20,000 each per annum, which is a tolerable
profit when you come to think that most of the
work is done by clerks. Apropos of the magni-
ficent salaries paid to managing clerks, a certain
Australian solicitor sometime ago engaged a
young English solicitor to conduct his business
(salary £l5O per annum) while he toured, the
Continent. The Englishman annexed £2OOO and
disappeared, and has never been captured although
a warrant was issued for his arrest. Last Christ-
mas the writer of this par came across the
quondam managing clerk at a big coffee-palace in
a neighbouring province where he held the
onerous position of “ boots.”

Labertouche, secretary to the Vic. Rail-

constitutes a distinguished visitor in the free-pass
sense of the term. Its wide significance extends
from the globe-trotting duke to the sister of an
English soft-goods agent, who comes out with her
brother on one of his periodical business-trips.
The social status of a distinguished visitor is an
unknown quantity down to a certain point. It is
essential that he or she shall be
Hinglish, in comfortable circumstances, and well
able to afford the price of a ticket. Poverty
never travels on a free-pass,

Item from Sydney paper :
QYDNEY HOSPITAL.—WiII the Nurse to whom
kJ a gentleman raised his hat yesterday please
to enclose an address to “F.,” Daily Telegraph
■Office.
Very likely she will. And then if she is acute
and business-like nurse there will presently be a
ruined and insolvent “F.” lying about, and after
a few weeks of joy and bankruptcy he will gather
up the hat abovementioned, and steal away to
some place where he can cool on a damp hillside,
and the vanished smile of the cash that is dead
will never return again. For though we have
seen a good many advertisements from men who
wanted to get acquainted with a nurse, we have
never yet seen an “ad.” from one of them an-
nouncing that he had got rid of the nurse again,
and wasn’t acquainted with her any longer. The
newspaper is full of the footprints of the men who
go in, but there are no traces of the men who come
out again. They are financially eaten by the
nurse, we presume.

A certain Abraham Fogel, of Sydney,
lately saved 4s. Bd. by using obliterated stamps on
his receipts. He explained matters by stating
that he had fallen overboard in the Harbour with
the stamps in his possession ; but after it had been
pointed out that he wasn’t likely to meet anybody
under water who would take the stamps out of his
tail-pocket, and obliterate them with ink, and
then put them back again, he compromised by
paying (in accordance with the merciful verdict of
a jury which could have fined him about £600)
£7O. Dead loss on the transaction, £69 15s. 4d.
Thus is the old order of things stood upon its
head. Many a man has got 4s. Bd. from a person
named Abraham and paid £7O for it, but when
Abraham gets 4s. 8d and pays £7O, the end of
time and space is assuredly at hand, and the crack
of doom is coming with seven-league boots down
the loud-resounding corridor of history.

THE FINE COLONIAL GENTRYMAN.
(A PICTURE FROM LIFE.)
He’s lord of half a million sheep,
And reaps a fleecy crop,
And when he isn’t fast asleep
He’s mostly “talking shop ;”
He never gave a pound away
Which didn’t bring him two ;
His parents were sent out, they say.
Aboard the Jamberoo —
This fine Colonial Gentryman,
One of our golden time !
He loafs around the “ Block M and smokes,
He’s loyal to the Queen ;
H e cannot see the point of jokes
Unless they are obscene;
He casts a small, suspicious eye
On all who haven’t “ stuff,”
And when the season’s extra dry
His adjectives are rough
This fine Colonial Gentryman,
One of our golden time !
He boozes in a brainless style
With kindred squatter men,
And buys a painted harlot’s smile
Just every now And then ;
He thinks the world is going wrong
When shearers make a stand ;
He’s sure the beggars’ souls belong
To owners of the land —
This fine Colonial Gentryman,
One of oitr golden time !j
He tries to ape the heavy swell,
But cannot judge the “side
However, he does something well—
He knows the way to ride.
Then let us drain a bumper to
Dame Nature’s dullest work,
The “ lag’’-begotten Johnnie who
Has got his name in Burke,
As a fine Colonial Gentryman,

Of dear, departed Ben,
Could work the point as he was seeking arter;
But now his eldest son
Will quickly get it done -
They’ll “ Bart-ify” the hub of Marlbro’s darter!

RADAM’S MICROBE KILLER.
9 Smith-street, Balmain, N.S.W.,
11th August, 1891.
To Radam's Microbe Killer Company.
Dear Sirs, —1 have been a great sufferer for oyer
sixteen years from pains in the legs from the hips
down to the toes, and also in great misery for
nine years from a kidney disease, during which
time I found I was losing the use of my legs,
particularly the right one, from weakness in the
joints. I tried nearly every known remedy, and
received but little relief until I commenced to use
the MICROBE KILLER.
It is now eight weeks since I commenced its
use, and having used two one-gallon jars, I find
myself an entirely different man. I believe a
little more will entirely cure my complaints, as I
can say that I have not felt so well for eight or
nine years, and can now do my work as well as
ever I could, and also enjoy my meals, which for
many years I could not.—l remain, yours thank-
fully ’ THOS. FISHER

There was an interesting point about a
waees case, tried the other day at the other end
of the world. At Westminster County Court,
Miss Chappel, house and parlourmaid (a sign of
the times was that she is spoken of by the
naners as “Miss” instead of Sarah or Mary),
sued a Mr. Kennedy lor nine days’ wages at 16s.

R. J. Whelan, in it description of a 1000-
Ihiles ride across Queensland, tells how he had as
companions for the first part of the journey two
voung fellows bound for Normanton—one return-
ing to a young wife after six months’ absence, and
the other going to get married. The rivers were
a p bankers, but this ardent pair compelled
Whelan to dash through all obstacles. At Vena
Park he parted with them, but afterwards heard
that they rode four horses to death and were fined
at Normanton for furious driving.
Dr. Richard West-
rum, who died at .Syd-
ney recently, from a
self -administered
over-dose of morphia,
was a typical German
who loved science.
He had many friends,
and was esteemed
everywhere as a good
■surgeon and a good
fellow. The circum-
stances of his death
were peculiarly pain-
ful. A couple of
vears back he fell out
of a buggy and hurt
his knee. The injury
remained, and it was
discovered that the
joint was tuberculous.
This effectually lamed
him, and he took to
his bed, in which he
lay in one position
for at least fifteen
months. Meanwhile,
tuberculous lung-
disease progressed
rapidly, and it was
to end his terrible
suffering, which, as a
medical man, he knew
could only be termin-
ated by death, that
he took the morphia.
The doctor was
formerly a house-
surgeon at Sydney
Hospital, and it is a
ghastly fact that he
was the last of four
resident doctors who
left that institution
in succession each
to die of phthisis !
Thequarters provided
forthehouse-surgeons
were, until the advent
of Dr. Hull, the pre-
sent medical superin-
tendent, a perfect
death-trap. There is
a lesson in sanitation
for an incredulous
public. The saddest
part of this sad busi-
ness is that not one
out of the four dead
young doctors was a
eons titutionally-
phthisical man.

Dr. Beehag, the
clever young medico
who died of typhoid

attack from which he
died.

Exhibition, the other evening, with much
brilliancy. The symbolic pageant was capital.
There were two big trophy-cars. One enshrining

six fine girls typifying the Australian provinces.
# # *
The representation of Parkes in the
Federation tableau at the mask ball aforesaid,
was greeted with roars of laughter. This was
rather hard, considering that the Germans in-
tended to do honour to the Hairy Bismarck,
whose snowy locks ■ and stately mien, combined
with an old-fashioned nail-can and black-green
suit, occupied a great deal of time and attention
in their get-up.
At the recent annual dinner of the British
Authors’ Society, Mona Caird refused to rise
When the Queen’s health was proposed, and her
example was followed by two or three other ladies
of less note. Lord Monks well was chairman of
the clinrier; and in giving permission for the
customary post-prandial smoke, he laid especial
stress upon the word gentlemen. Notwithstanding
this broad hint, several ladies produced cigarette-
cases and lit up. The German habit of smoking
during meals is gaining ground in England, like
everything Teutonic. Oscar Wilde always puffs a
cigarette after soup and after game.

On the last voyage of the Warfego from
Melbourne northwards a bright little maiden
made a surprising sensation on board, and broke
the moral bank of the community. She was
pretty, and aged about 18, and she was travelling
alone—therefore the male passengers set her down
as an orphan going out to face the cold, hard
world by herself, and they looked after her
tenderly." But the second night out, just as the
ladies were beginning to enjoy the moonlight, and
their husbands and brothers were organising the
customary poker-party, there was a burst of wild
melody and a flapping noise somewhere On deck;
Then there was a sound like somebody drawing a
cork in a secluded corner behind one of the deck-
houses, and a sudden howl, and a bit of an opera;
It was the bright little maiden, and she Was out
on an unholy toot with a bottle of brandy. A
motherly old female went and remonstrated with
her amid the shadows, but she said she
wouldn’t go home till morning, and asked
the old lady to “ come-an’-’avedrink ” ! Then she
broke loose and fled along the deck to the smoking-
room, where she offered to marry the entire poker-
party and assured them that they were jointly
and collectively the only man she had ever loVed.
Having finished this statement she embraced
three of them and breathed into their ears. Here
the captain and two officers took a hand and
gently shifted her below, and as she went she pro-
posed to the three of them. After which the
stewardess confiscated the brandy-bottle and
locked the erring girl in an empty berth for the
night, and left her calling for drink in her dreams.
The poker-party broke up early that evening ; it
consisted mostly of elderly gentlemen who hadn’t
been proposed to by a bright maiden of 18 for
many years, and the shock was too much for
them.

THE GREAT REMEDY FOR PAIN.
ST. JACOBS OIL.
WHAT IT IS.
SIX STANDARD VIRTUES.
Ist. It is in one word a cure ; it is not merely
a relief, and in no sense a cure-all; it is the
product of scientific research.
2nd. It strengthens while it sooothes and sub-
dues, heals and cures ; it literally conquers pain.
3rd. Its effects are curative and permanent to
the whole group of muscular miseries and nervous
agonies.
4th. It does not merely irritate the outer sur-
face, nor does it merely soften or relax a constricted
muscle. To its specific action a superior curative
virtue is superadded.
sth. It penetrates deeply but gently; search-
ingly and surely seeking the pain spot in an effort
to conquer.
6th. _ Each constituent of the formula has a
recognised intrinsic virtue to serve most surely
the cure of pain.
WHAT DOES?
What becomes of the word after it is spoken?
Also, what becomes of the light when the candle
is blown out? .Both these queries were gravely
propounded for discussion some years ago in the
Debating Society of a country township in
A' ictoria by a member who was an earnest seeker
after truth. Both subjects provoked a considerable
deal of unpleasantness, which in one instance, at
least, culminated in physical violence, and the
removal of a highly respected stock and station
agent, who was a God-fearing man with one leg
shorter than the other and a lar,ge family, to the
local hospital for repairs. But they were never
satisfactorily solved, and ip the course of the effort
some neighbors ceased to be friends; relatives
even became temporarily estranged, and one
estimable family of Polish origin and the Hebrew
persuasion became so broken up that it could
never again be united. The wife went to her
mother, the husband went on the roads with
jewellery, the son stole all the horses off the town-
ship reserve and headed for Queensland, and the
daughter went to service. This is a true story,
and all brought about by a crank, who suddenly
disappeared and was never seen for years until he
turned up a little while ago in the same locality
as a book canvasser. And now he is dead.
W Inch is of no consequence except as a subject
whereon to congratulate everybody in all the
colonies wherein he might have strayed at some
time had he lived. The only question'on the same
lines that has never been answered is—“ What
becomes of all the people who are annually blown
up by kerosene explosions ?’’ Of course, any
answer to that must be pure guesswork, though
some of them who have come down again have
promptly guarded against a repetition of the
incident by purchasing Luxene, the new illu-
rninant, from one or other of the undermentioned
firms : Messrs. J. Barlow and Co., T. W. Eady
and Son, Mason Brothers, Limited, D. Mitchell
and Co., 1 illock and Co., J. Keep and Sons,
Holdsworth, Macpherson, and Co.. M‘Lean
Brothers and Bigg, Limited, Fred. Butcher,
Robert Miller, and J. F. Barrett, Sydney; J.
Ireland, R. Hall and Sons, and David Miller,
Newcastle. But with regard to those whenever
return the query still awaits solution. What does
become of them ?
AN APT QUOTATION.
“ Suit the action to the word, the word to the
action.”— Shakespeare.
The word is “ Waterbury,” the action comprises
the insertion of the digits into that receptacle of
your habiliments where you conceal the proceeds
of your daily toil and the prompt withdrawal of
13s 6d. This sum will procure a Waterbury watch
series E, a faithful and reliable time-recorder ; or,
if you can afford to dip a little deeper into your
pocket and part with 22s 6d, invest in a series J
or L. These are marvels of mechanical and
inventive ingenuity.
The J is a short-wind, stem-setting watch, with
quick-train, back-racket, jewelled duplex escape-
ment, sunk seconds-hand, enamelled dial, and
dust-proof case. The new ladies’ Waterbury
(series L) is a similar watch to the above, made in
a smaller size and without a second-hand. It is a
neat and elegant little article, and, above all, an
accurate time-keeper.

“Why
Because
A Parisian has been sent to gaol for in-
sulting the executioner: “ There goes the assassin!”
he shouted. Which reminds one that good old
oir Allred btephen once strongly advised the
oydney hangman— so says that grim functionary—
to take a libel-suit against Sydney Evening News,
which had spoken of the finishing-schoolmaster in
disparaging terms. In our mind’s eye, Horatio,
see that alleged interview between Sir
Alfred and Jack Ketch. What an historical
picture it would make !
Before a French correctional tribunal the
. V a y a woman was charged with marital
infidelity, her paramour being one Bodin, also
arraigned. The husband proved his ease and
then asked for mercy on behalf of Bodin. “ Ah,
Monsieur le President,”said he, “you don’t know
Justine ! She is a regular demon, and has been
the scourge of ray life ever since I married her.
You cannot imagine what a relief it is to be rid of
her. Bodin, poor man, has taken my burden upon
himself. He little knows wjiat is in store for
him. (Shrieks of laughter.) The Court gave
Justine six days’ gaol, and allowed poor Bodin to
escape with a fine of IOOf. only.
The Lord Mayor of London was lately
made a baronet for entertaining the German
Emperor. “ The entertainment cost the Mayor
very little and the public a great deal,” says Moon-
shine. “ The public cannot have a baronetcy, of
course ; still, in recognition of its share in the
affair, we do not see why a baronetcy should not
be conferred upon the city rate-collector.” This
is the soundest argument we have read for a long
time in any Tory paper,
, This is the manner of sub-contract as she
is practised in Queensland, West Australia, ay,
and N.fe.W. for that matter. A takes a big rail-
way contract and lets it out in hunks to sub-con-
tractors. B and C take from A a fairly large
job at a price per cubic yard that doesn’t nearly
cover the cost of construction. B and C have
not a cent between them with which to pay
wages, but they have a notion and they know how
to home-make grog. So they run up a kennel
which they call a boarding-house, and on the
strength of their contract get credit from the
butcher, baker, and storekeeper. Then they
engage men, but only such men as agree to board
at their hash-house and patronise deeply their
home-made fuse Toil. By and by, as the contract
is about finished, B bolts to Guam with all the
cash A pays him, slipping up his wages-men and
the storekeepers as well, while C stays behind,
pretendedly cursing B, goes insolvent, gets for-
given and generally pitied. Then C combines
with D to take another contract, and plays the same
old game, at the end of which it is C’s turn to slope
and join B in Guam. The law should deal
strictly with sub-contracts, by at least making
the chief-contractor responsible for all wages.
Let the chief protect himself against the sub. by
special agreement and the withholding of pay-
ments to the sub. until the latter’s men’s wages are
paid and duly receipted.

who will forward the Pamphlet hy return mail.
We would respectfully refer as to our reliability to the Editor of this paper.
Let it be distinctly understood that this is no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a grain of medicine of any
kind required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst cases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption,
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in-
cluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, am
of other internal organs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically ncutia
lising and removing their causes, thus (dinning
nature herself to do her work uninivcdcd.
We now simply repeat that the new treatment
acts so radically and fundamentally upon the vital
circulation without the least danger to the most
delicate constitution, that there is not a form ot
disease that flesh is heir to, which will not be
affected favorably to the patient by an intelligent
use of this method of treatment.
In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to le-
require a “Pledge of Honor” from those purchas-
ing it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
of their own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only moans by which our just
rights in the discovery can be mantamed.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
providing they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
Read the Reports from Sydney Papers.
The Australian Temperance World says;- We can
thoroughly recommend it as a Rename treatment that
must benefit most all disorders. It requires no outlay
after purchasing the pampnlet. It is based upon
thorough! v hygienic principles, and we believe every
thorough user must receive benefit. One great considera-
tion with ladies will be that it secures a clear skin and
speedily does away with a muddy complexion, and
removes all eruptions ar sing from diseased conditions of
the'blood. We have made"ourselves familiar with the
pamphlet, and heartily endorse it.”
Presbyterian, of July 4, saysWe have seen the
pamphlet, and can thoroughly recommend its rationale.
The Freeman’s Journal says: —“ After a careful perusal
of the pamphlet” we have no hesitancy in recommending
e treatment which Dr. Hall -discovered.

The Sydney Mail srysWe have seen the pamphlet,
and although we cannot reveal its secrets, we can beai
testimony to the bona-Jldes of the advertisement.
Martin's Home and Farm says:-" We can recommend
it as a genuine thing.”
The Aultßaliax Star says:— “lt is thoroughly purify-
ing hygienic, and rational in the highest degree.’
Truth says;—“ It is beyond a doubt all that is claimed
Times sayslt will, we believe where cure
is not possible, assist in alleviating ; and to folks suffering
from habitual constipation, indigestion, deficient cir-
dilation, and poorness of blood, it cannot fail to be of
bC T!rfshanc Evening Observer saysA feature of the
treatment is that it requires no extra expense after the
first cost of the pamphlet, and can he applied as easily in
the bush as in the city.”
The Echo, Bulletin, and other leading papers speak in
similar unqualified terms. _ . , ~
Austh ALIAS Independent says:—“To suffering humanity
wc regard the discovery as a wonderful boon.”
The following testimonials from ministers, doctors, and private persons speak for them
selves and they are but a drop in the bucket of the thousands received
DR. R. E. STEVENS’ INDORSEMENT.
Dr. Stevens, of Syracuse, N.Y., was the first
M D. to whom we revealed the new treatment-
more than 20 years ago. In writing to a friend,
about a year ago, he gives the following
■>: * * * * “Nearlv twenty years ago in this city Dr. A.
Wilford Hall gave 'me privately a detailed history of a
hygienic treatment he had discovered and adopted some
twenty years before, and which lie had practised con-
tinuously upon himself up to that time. The histoiy
included an account of the failure of the health, the
reasonings and conclusions which led him to adopt the
treatment, his rapid restoration to health, &c. I' rom the
time of hfs first mention of it to me I have been enniely
satisfied that it saved him from a lingering consumption
and death ; and that in the years following as I have evi-
dence to satisfy me, its continued practice has so affected
the nutrient and eliminating functions as toe to Ins
physical structure a greater degree of sohuily, or, in
other words, a higher specific gravity than that possessed
by any other man living. I learn that lie has peisistently
continued the treatment to the present time - forty years
in all—and that his present health and vigorous condition
may rightfully be compared to the ‘ bloom of youth,
though he is nearly seventy years of age. The tests I
have made of the treatment upon myself and in my prac-
tice in the twenty years past, have convinced me that
great practical benefit may be derived by members of the
medical profession and others from a careful study of the
rationale of the treatment as discovered by Dr. Hall, the
details of which he proposes to give in his forthcoming
book. A debt of gratitude will sure ybe due to him for
whatever scientific advances he may be able to unfold in
the line of assisting nature to ward of! disease, and in the
restoration of health. It. F. Stevens, M.D.

I find myself entirely cured of that very painful com-

“ Mr J. C, Oakman, 8 O'Connell-street, Sydney.—Dear
Sir —Yours of July 14 to hand. Thank you very much
for’you r kind offer, to help me in case I could not under-
stand thoroughly the pamphlet or if 1 found difficulty in
amilving the treatment. It is not the case. I understand
English as well as French, and as for the treatment it has
already done a world of good, and the pamphlet is worth
hundred times the money. If it had been translated in
French I would have advised some friends and
relations at home to buy it. This is the
reason why I was asking, and I hope it will soon
he translated in every known language and spread
all over the world. I have been suffering from dyspepsia
for the last 20 years, and a few days of this treatment
has done me more good and given me more relief than
all the’remedies I ever tried before.-1 am, dear sir, yours

“ ** x Touchinsr your wonderful discovery, I take much
pleasure in saying I am delighted with its effects upon
my system. I sent for it that I might know its influence
on a healthy person. I have now used it about three
months, and intend to continue its use during my mortal
life. The treatment produces a general refreshing, in-
vigorating effect; sharpens my appetite, sweetens my
sleep, and makes me feel as though I had a new lease of
life. 1 have persuaded several of my brethren of the
ministry to send for your Health-Pamphlet, and so far as
1 have heard from them they are exceedingly pleased.
One of them said to me a few days ago, * I would not
take £5O for it. It knocks the bottom out of disease.’ I

month the treatment desciihcd in Dr. A. W. Hails
health pamphlet, and I certainly feel a wonderful
improvement in health, so great that I cannot describe
how very different my feelings are, for life is now enjoy-
able ; hut for nine years past it has often been very
miserable. In the head I have suffered dreadfully, owing
to softening of the brain, and often partial tempoiaiy
paralysis of tongue, and other parts; also frequent
severe pains at the heart, with less and less capacity foi
work, and other troubles, all of which ha\ e ccas< d to
trouble me except a slight occasional reminder at the
heart. lam exceedingly thankful to the Almighty, and
to Dr. Hall, and yourself, that I am so well, for a month

“j C. Oakman. Dear Sir,—l have very much pleasure in
testifying to the efficiency of Dr. Hall’s hygienic treatment.
I have been a sufferer from indigestion and constipation
in its worst forms for the last eight years, and during
that time I have consulted four (4) medical practitioners
of great skill, but have received very little relief. I have
used a terrible lot of pills and patent medicines. At first
they used to give me a certain amount of relief, but for
six months before using Dr. Hall’s remedy they were quite
useless For three months before using the hygienic
treatment I suffered terrible pain in my stomach and
bowels, especially at night. I could not sleep hut very
little and had frightful dreams. Mrs. M‘lnnes had to put
mustard plasters and hot flannels across my stomach
before I could get any relief. I have been using the
hv'denic treatment for five weeks, and thank God it has
gi “en me great relief. Since I have started to use it I
have not felt any pain, and can sleep quite sound every
ni"-ht I have not felt the slightest touch of indigestion
since,'and can eat three hearty, good meals every day.
Everybody says how well 1 begin to look. My wife and
daughter also use it with good results. I have not the
slightest doubt but that it will cure diseases of the
stomach liver, hidnev, and bowels.-Faithfully yotitT,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The most necessary qualification for a suc-
.f.ii bank official, in these business times, is a
Sough comprehension of the twin arts of ' lying
f °!> and “levanting.” At the first blush it
«muld appear that the would-be levanter has no
Sce-or, at least, a very slender chance-of
caning from this island continent, seeing that he
f! watched at every port, and on every outward-
bound vessel, by an army of heaven-born detec-
ts and lynx-eyed and inspired police, who are
Clairvoyants at seeing, and trance-mediums at m-
Snreting “a clue.” Think of the complex
organisation arrayed against the solitary, and
Cften unaided, attempting absconder ! His des-
C- Dtion is recorded at every police-station in
J,. v province, but as the description is invariably
!! unlike the “ wanted ” as human blundering can
mke it, perhaps that dosen’t matter much;
housh on the other hand, as the average bobby
always reads the description upside-down and m-
Cde out, perhaps it does matter after all. His
photograph is largely circulated amongst the sea-
port officials, but, as he generally alters his facial
appearance, this also has to be discounted. The
free and urgent use of the telegraph wires is avail-
able to the whole body of thief-catchers, and any-
except a balloon can be stopped anywhere
cn route “on suspicion.” It is owing to the com-
nlpteiiess of police organisation that the occasional
cultures, which the public are taught by the press
to regard as “ sensationally smart,” are made, but
there are nothing more than the ordinary
seauences of the driest routine work. Ihe police
nfficial —the “D” or the common constable—
always moves in fixed grooves. His “information
received ” is the result of the treachery of a
“fiz°ig” or criminal traitor in his pay often a
less offender whom he could arrest if he chose,
hut whose peccadilloes he ignores in consideration
of his “ peaching ” services; still more frequently,
a ladv of shadowy repute who has, as her tempor-
arv husband, a criminal, or an associate of
criminals. Once get outside of police routine and
the whole service is at fault. A “ wanted who
knows the official methods needs only money and
cool assurance to circumvent them.
# * *
I could tell—and I will tell some other
time if The Bulletin thinks fit—a strange,
weird yarn of a successful “lying low ’ and a
subsequent clean “levanting,’’the peculiar feature
of which was that the “wanted was taken
aboard an outward-bound vessel m a police-boat,
and by the very police-officer who held the
warrant for his arrest, and who was going to
search that vessel for him. I could—and may
possibly-tell another anecdote about another
wanted, who hid for many weeks, and who fed
and “grogged” sumptuously every day in a
government building, under the very noses of the
police of a large city ; but the poor devil got so
sick of his retirement that he at last gave himself
up and faced the resultant music.
I have been led to think of thtse things from the
receipt of a letter from a former friend of mine,
who went wrong and is at present at Honolulu
for the benefit of his health. The letter of this
—I am sorry to say unrepentant man—shall speak
for itself :
Honolulu, Sunday, 00th, X —, 1891.
My dear , You will see by the above heading that *
am in safety enjoying the fruits of my big coup. lam
satisfied, thank you. I have gained the ambition of my
life. When I look back at my chances, as some one said
once (was it Clive or Warren Hastings?), I am astonished
at my own moderation. It was a work of years. I was a
pious little messenger-boy, and very lucky on race horses.
1 was a steady and a careful book-keeper, with the devil's
own fortune at fan-tan. I made a splendid confidential
clerk and learned some “ points’' from the directors, who
insisted on explaining to me the weaknesses in the exist-
ing bank laws. They didn’t want those laws meddled
with, however, because though there were many holes by
which the bank fell through, there were still more holes
which let the customers through, and a general repair
would have left the institution in the lurch. When I was
promoted to be manager of a branch I knew that my
chance had come. I did the confidence trick in the old,
old way—the Sunday-school racket and the church-choir
enthusiasm. I needn’t put you up to my methods of
‘‘ general scoop.” Should 3 r ou ever get a billet iii a bank,
though, I’ll send you out the fullest rules and regulations
to guide you on your royal progress to wealth.
How did I get away ? As simply as taking a tram. I
trusted no one except Bill Rogers. I trusted him because
he would have been compromised himself if I bad been
cotched. I did not even* confide in my wife and family.
I had to get them a distance away on a complicated yarn
that wouldn’t interest you ; it was very easily invented. Bill
and I soon came to the conclusion that the safest way to
“ lie low ” until the “ hue and cry ” was a hit abated, was
as an invalid in the house of a policeman in a marine
suburb. Bill knew of just such a party—a thick-headid,
goodnatured Irishman, described in the evening papers
Is a “ very intelligent officer.” “To be coorse ” (he said
in reply to Bill) “ I will oblige yere frind, th’ sick malm,
an’ it’s the purty shpare room Oi have, an’Molly s the
kindest craythur that iver drew the breath av loife.
And so I lay for many days in the calm seclusion of the
official bosom, shamming sick, being visited almost dary
by the local doctor, and letting ray beard grow (I only
had a moustache before) and only going out on dark
nh-hts for brief exercise. The weeks sped on, and as my
whiskers began to form a natural framework of disguise
around iuy features, I thought it was time to make the
next move. So I gradually recovered-to some
extent-and one blazing morning I hade tie
policeman and his wife a sad and tender faie
well, and departed feebly with a view to completing my
recovery in the mountains. Then I made for the loneliest
place on the adjacent sea-shore, and having bathed my
face and hands, neck and forearms, in lemon-,puce, I lay
drying in the sun on the glittering sand. The transfor-
mation was wonderful. In two hours I was like a half-
baked nigger. I lay low in my new capacity all day in
the hush, and that evening Bill Rogers fetched along a
romdi suft of clothes, a swag and a hilly, and a soft telt
hat? I started on the wallaby taking the south-east
coast I turned up at the new Pamhula diggings where I
opt work on a claim for a time- navvy work. I soon
sickened of the eternal pick and shovel, hut it was
necessary as part of my sate plan. After a few weeks on
Pamhula I went on to the seaport of Eden, in company
with other returning prospectors. I was only one among
a dozen bronzed diggers (the lemon-juice trick had been
repeated several times), and I caused no suspicion. 1 got
away to Hobart-pretendedly en route for the Zeehan
silver-mines—by a small steamer, and the rest was easy—
an unsuspected and open voyage to this joyous island,
where everybody is either a happy nigger or an absconder^
I send you these particulars in case, dear bov, you may
ever need to skedaddle suddenly. Enc osed are ten £2O-
- that I omitted to change into gold before I lef t > t
are of no use to me here. Their numbers are not know n

benefit of any Bulletin readers who may need to
“ slide ” surreptitiously. Also, to give the polioo
a hint.—Yours, &e., The Dipsomaniac.

Far away in the blue distance the yellow ocean stretches

In the Bourke (N.8.W.) Police Court the
other day a charge of gross cruelty to a camel
fell through because the lawyer for the defence
submitted that “a camel was not an animal
within the meaning of the Act, ’ and the Bench
concurred. This was the only defence that was
raised, therefore we presume it was the only one
available. Anyhow the cruelty seemed to be
proved with sufficient clearness, but evidently
that didn’t matter; anybody can tie up a camel
and build a tire under it on the strength of this
dcision.
The bar of Merry’s Royal Hotel, Croydon,

space is 150 ft. in circuit and 32 T. in zone breadth.
Merry rather imagined the diggers of the first
Croydon rush knew the use of a bar. If the
above dimensions are correctly staged and ie
back-shelves of the bar form the diameter of the
half-moon, then, according to geometrical oscula-
tions the depth of the landlord’s part of the bar
is between 15 and 16ft., and covers an area of a
trifle more than 44i sq. yards (with counters);
while the public or drinking zone, winch is out-
side the counters and presumably clear standing
space, has an area of a fraction less than 3oi 2 sq.
yds. This, fr a wild bush hotel, should be baid

Truth.
Truth, greatest of the virtues and rarest, has so
long been a stranger to ordinary commercial
business, that when a perfectly conscientious
man maintains even a well known fact, that tact
assumes an additional importance, ihe truth
that should be sacred is twisted, and turned, and
mutilated, and in many cases utterly suppressed,
to suit the commercial ends of enterprising
unscrupulous people. There are many of these
who will unblushingly steal facts relating to the
operations of others, of which they are only the
fraudulent and valueless representation. Looking
at the fact of truth’s scarcity in the proper light,
we must of a necessity value it the more because
of its rarity. And therefore, the following letter
from Father Fahy, of the Sydney (N • '' •»
Presbytery, speaks volumes for the efficacy of
Warner’s Safe Cure. Here is the reverend fathers
letter to 11. H. Warner & Co. “ Sydney, IS .S.W.

highest terms, by men whose sole object was
truth, and to help their fellow creatures D. W.
Fahy, Catholic Priest. And the whole and
absolute truth about Warner’s Safe Cure is just
this ;—lt is an infallible cure in kidney and liver
diseases, and all the physicians of the advanced
schools believe that if the kidneys are kept pure
and workable, which only Warner’s Safe Cure can
effect, people would escape ninety per cent, ot
disease. This is the absolute fact, as thousands ot
persons in Australasia willingly testify.

On Satm-ctay last Mr. J. B. Clarke’s Stromboli
earned off the A. J.O. Derby after a desperate race with
Uxide, which latter animal got left in the second place by
a short head. The head was so short that if Oxide had
put out his tongue at the last moment he might
have won even then. The time was 2.41, and
0n u ,P n three occasions was the event run with
mo • iLJ* 00 *”!’ the shortest time being Trident’s
" 1,1 i°° 6 - ■“ter was third. Mr. George Hill’s Marvel
scooped the Epsom Handicap with a brilliant rush at the
last moment. Muriel, which sundry knowing individuals
declared to be the only possible winner of last year’s
Melbourne Cup, was second, just far enough off to lose,
and near enough to cause bitter execrations among those
who backed her at 16 to 1, and saw their money rise
hotore them like a dream and then fade away. Elymas,
? i ~v* 1 animal, was third, and sundry lavishly
backed brutes were nowhere. Both Stromboli and Marvel
were favounles at even money. The Hurdle Race was
taken by Bettma, a neglected outsider. Affiance, another
outsider, gathered in the Trial Stakes. The Spring
Stakes were carried off by Megaphone in brilliant fashion,
with Albemarle second, and that mysterious animal High-
born, which so gracefully lost last year’s Melbourne Cup,
close behind.

owner of Common being very much in funds by the
horse s big successes, wouldn’t sell his hero if he thought
there was a reasonable chance of getting another fifteen
thousand (and interest) out of him. Common, moreover
was never brought out as a two-year-old, and has only run

Arthur Rae, one of the members for the
Murrumbidgee, has given notice of the following
resolution, which he proposes to move in the
iN.S. W. Legislative Assembly on 20th October
That in the opinion of this House no form of federation
will prove acceptable to the people of N.S. Wales which
does not provide for the complete political independence
ot the Australian Commonwealth under a Republican form
of government.
That motion, it may be presumed, is not likely to
be placed before the House by Speaker Abbott,
who will probably declare it to be “ unconstitu-
tional, and in contravention of the “oath of
allegiance to Her Majesty,” to which Rae
subscribed on taking his seat. Speaker Abbott
course, carefully forget to state that
the oath of allegiance ” is a bogus thing,
an enforced (though empty) ceremonial gone
through only under penalty of absolute dis-
franchisement. However, let it be imagined
that Mr. Speaker does not raise the constitutional
spook, and the motion actually is submitted to the
present Assembly. How many of the sitting
members would vote for it ? In the first place
the cowards wouldn’t vote at all, but it is to be
taken for granted that existing machinery could
provide for a call ”of the House and compel
these to assume definite divisional positions.
1 here are many members who would have to vote
straight ” whether they liked it or not—who
would have to vote in harmony with their outside
utterances. For instance, the members for
Northumberland would have to vote—we believe
they would gladly vote —for Rae’s motion.
Avowed Republicans, of whom there are many
in the House, would have to vote for it. The
members for Bourke would have to vote for it
A very large percentage-if not every man jack-
et the Labour-party would have to vote for
it. But the motion would nevertheless be lost
Let it be supposed that this stage had
actually been arrived at. What would Premier
Parkes do? Would he take the judicious and
statesmanlike course of being timely unwell ?
Would he re-break some funny-bone and relegate
his Parliamentary duties to Bruce Smith ? Or
would he, as in duty bound by his “ oath of alle-
giance,” at once rise from his Ministerial seat,
and, seriatim, move that the seat of each rebel
each seditious violator of his “Hoath hof Halle-
giance” be declared vacant? If he did this—
what would follow? A tame submission? Not
in Australia. A dissolution of Parliament? Or
an outside revolution? In either event, the
embryo which now “ is without form and void ”
would vitalise into an entity of discernible pro-
portions and shape and with a self-developing
destiny—the Australian Republic. The Austra-
lian Republic is coming along all the time.

Sweet innocent, take an old man’s advice,
Don’t be wishing for what’s so nice ;
Beware of those lovely girls you meet,
Though the daintiest shoes encase their feet
And the prettiest stockings their legs adorn,
For a rose oftimes conceals a thorn.
They may be everything proper, ’ tis true,
But they probably know too much for you.
Beware of them, and beware of drink ;
Ere you swallow the poison just pause and think.
So go and join a temperance band
And walk with them lovingly hand in hand.
Round the Shops and Shows.*
One of the most interesting “snrin»”
windows in the city is Mrs. M‘Cathie’s, 81 KiL
street. Here one sees the most tasteful milling
and the daintiest of childrens’ garments on viev/
whilst the display of the various styles of
now worn is something to remember. The eoorl!
at this establishment are all selected with perfeoi
taste and judgment, therefore no lady can mat
any mistake by making her purchases here

Mr. Cecil Hordern, of 480, 488, 490
George-street, also makes a handsome show in
windows. Mdhnery seems to be the strong poffi

by the scores of smart hats and bonnets of
all shapes and sizes shown at the principal shops
.But it would take a brave show of millinery V.
beat that of Mr. Cecil Hordern’s. The arrange

thing unique, and the primroses write their
owner s name quite cleverly. It is worth going to

Soap is one of the most extensively-
advertised articles of commerce, and it strikes the
casual observer as an anomaly that while English
and American manufacturers have actually to
import their tallow from our shores and reshinit
« S s ? a F’ P a yi n g double freightage, they can
still afford to spend large fortunes annually in
advertising their brands and compete and beat
local makers in their own markets. Surely this is a
conundrum the Labour-party might solve but
nonour where honour is due. A local firm are
turning out a soap in tins called “Maefie’s Cold
Water Soap ’’ which is the best and most efficient
soap for washing clothes we have seen tried and
we have no hesitation in recommending its use to
the wearied and worried housewife

It is a fact worth remembering that Mr
Leon Harris of Market-street, gives the top price
for opals and pearls in the rough. But this is not
all—he also shines as a gem-cutter and diamond-
setter. Any piece of jewellery, no matter how
old-fasmoned it may be, can, under the skilful
touch of Mr. Harris, be re-modelled, so ladies can
keep pace with the fashions of the day, as far as
their jewels are concerned, at a very trifling cost.

(Special Bulletin Translation.)
TTe died the chief of a high tribunal, an upright
Tndfre whose irreproachable life was known and.
'honoured in every court of France. Advocates,
counsellors, judges, bowed low as a mark of pro-
found respect before his white spare face, lightened
bv those profound and brilliant eyes.
He had passed his life in punishing crime and
nrotecting the weak. The swindler and the raur-
L rer had had no enemy more dreaded ;he seemed
to read in the depths of their souls their most
secret thoughts, and to penetrate at a glance the
whole mystery of their plans.
Now he was dead, at the age of 82, followed by
the homage and regrets of a whole nation. A
vpo-iment of soldiers had escorted him to his tomb,
and men in white ties had poured out over his
coffin lamenting words and tears that seemed
81 Yet this strange paper was found by his notary,
stupefied at the discovery, in the desk where he
had been in the habit of keeping the records of
great criminals. It was headed simply ;
WHY?
June 20, 1851. The trial is over. I have con'
demned Blondel to death. Why did this man
kill those five children? Why? One often meets
men for whom the destruction of life has a certain
voluptuous charm. Yes, it must have a charm
the sweetest of all, perhaps, because is not
killing the nearest approach to creating ? Make
and destroy ! Those two words embrace the
history of the universe, all that is—yes, all. Why
ia it so intoxicating to kill ? ...
June 25.— T0 think that there is a being there,
living, walking, running. A being ? What is a
being? That animated thing, bearing in itself
the principle of movement, and a will that regu-
lates the movement! It belongs to nothing, that
thing. Its feet are not attached to the soil. It
is a grain of life stirring on the earth; and that
crain of life, that comes no one knows whence,
you can destroy as you will. Then it is gone,
nuite gone. It rots, it is no more.
H June 26. —Why, then, is it a crime to kill ? Yes,
why? Oa the contrary, it is a law of nature.
Every being’s mission is to kill; it kills for life’s
sake and it kills for killing’s sake. To kill is in
our nature; we must kill. The beast kills un-
ceasingly, every day, at every instant of its
existence. Man kills unceasingly, for food ; but
as he feels the need to kill for pleasure, too, he
has invented the chase. The child kills the in-
sects he finds, the little birds, all the little living
things that come in his way. But that does not
satisfy the irresistible craving that is in us for
massacre. It is not enough to kill beasts, we are
to kill man. Formerly, this craving
was satisfied by human sacrifices. io-day,
the necessities of social existence have made
murder a crime. The assassin is condemned
and punished. But we cannot live without yield-
ing to this natural and imperious instinct for
death, so we soothe ourselves from time to time
with wars in which one whole nation destroys
another. Then there is a debauch of blood, a
debauch in which the armies run mad, and which
makes drunk even the quiet citizens at home, and
the women and the children as they read under
the lamp at night the glowing descriptions of
slaughter. . . . .
One might think that those whose mission it is
to accomplish these human butcheries would be
despised. No, They are overwhelmed with
honours. They are dressed in gold and bright
scarlet; they wear plumes on their heads, and
decorations on their breasts; crosses, rewards,
titles of all kinds are heaped upon them. Ihey
are proud, respected, loved by women, cheered by
the crowd, solely because their calling is to pour
out human blood. They drag through the streets
their instruments of death, which black-coated
passers-by regard with envy. For to kill is the
great law implanted by nature in the heart of
every being. There is nothing grander or more
honourable than to kill!
June SO. -To kill is a law ; because nature loves
eternal youth. In every unconscious act she
seems to cry “Quick! quick! quick!” ihe
faster she destroys, the faster she renews.
July 2. —A being—what is a being? Every-
thing and nothing. By the mind, it is the reflex
of everything. By memory and knowledge, it is
an epitome of the world, whose history it bears in
itself. A mirror of things and of deeds, every
human being becomes a little universe in the
universe.
But travel; see the nation swarm and seethe,
and man is nothing ! absolutely nothing ! Take
ship, get away from the crowded land, and soon
you see nothing but the shore. The imperceptible
being disappears, so small is he, so insignificant.
Cross Europe in a fast train, and watch from the
window. Men, fur ever men, men innumerable,
unknown, swarming in the fields, swarming in the
streets; dull peasants knowing just enough to
turn the soil; repulsive women knowing just
enough to make soup for their males and bear
children. Go to India, go to China, and you will
see teeming millions of beings who are born, who
live, and who die, leaving no more trace than the
ant crushed on the path. Go to the land of the
negro, squatting in his mud hut; to the land of
the Arab, sheltered under the dusky canvas
flapping in the wind, and you will realise that the
isolated, determinate being is nothing. The race
is everything. What is a single being, this or
that individual of some wandering tribe of the
desert? These races are philosophers; they do
not trouble about death. A man counts for
nothing with them. You kill your enemy ;it is
war. So it was with us in the old days, from
realm to realm, and from province to province.
Yes, travel round the world and see the human
creatures swarm, innumerable and unknown.
Unknown? Ah, that is the solution of the pro-
blem. To kill is a crime, because we have
numbered and marked the individuals. As they
are born, they are registered, named, baptised.
The law claims them. The unregistered being
does not count; kill him on the moor or in the
desert, kill him on the mountain or in the plain,
and what does it matter? Nature loves death,
and she does not punish the slayer.
The real sanctity, then, lies in the registry-
office, It is that which protects a man. The
being is sacred because it is enrolled in the register
—the legal holy of holies!
The State can kill, because it has the right to
revise the register. When it has destroyed two
hundred thousand men in a war, it strikes them
off its list, it wipes them out by the hand of its
clerks. There is an end of it. But we who can’t
make alterations in the public records must res-
pect life. Oh ! Register, glorious divinity who
reignest in the temples of the State, I salute thee.'
Thou art greater than Nature herself.
/ July 3.— There must be a strange, exquisite
pleasure in murder. To have there, before you, a
living, thinking being; to make a little hole in it—
just a little hole—to see the flow of the red some-
thing we call blood, that makes the life—and then
to have nothing before yon but a heap of limp
flesh, cold, inert, empty of thought! .
August 5. I who have passed my life in judg-
ing, in condemning to death by spoken words to
death by the guillotine—those who have put to
death by the knife—l ? if I were to do as the
assassins have done whom I have punished I .
who would know it ?
August 10. —Who would ever know it ? Would
they suspect me, me —especially if I chose a being
in whose removal I could have no interest ?
August 15. —Temptation ! The temptation has
entered into me like a creeping worm. It creeps;
it never rests; through and through my body;
into my mind, that can think only this one thought
—to kill; into my eyes, that ache for the sight of
blood, of death; into my ears, that ring un-
ceasingly with a mysterious something—horrible,
blood-curdling, maddening, like a being’s last cry;
into my legs, that tremble with desire to be gone,
to be gone to the place where if will be; into my
hands, that quiver with the craving to kill. How
sweet it must be, how rare, how worthy of a bold
man, one superior to the common herd, who is
master of his own soul and who seeks refined
sensations !
August 22. I could resist no longer. I have
killed a little animal as an experiment, a com-
mencement. Jean, my servant, had a goldfinch
hanging in a cage at the pantry-window. I sent
Jean on a message, and took the little bird in my
hand. I felt his heart beat. He was warm. I
went upstairs to my room. From time to time I
squeezed him harder; his heart beat faster; it
was cruel and delicious. I nearly choked him.
But then I would not have seen his blood.
I took a pair of scissors, short nail-scissors, and
out his throat in three snips, very gently. He
gasped, and struggled to escape ; but I held him ;
oh ! I held him; I could have held a mad dog.
And I saw the blood flow. How beautiful blood
is, how red and bright and clear! I longed to
drink it. I dipped the end of my tongue in it.
It is good. But he had so little of it, the poor,
little bird. I had not time to enjoy the sight of
it as I should have wished. It must be superb to
watch a bull bleed !
Then I acted as assassins do—real ones. I
washed the scissors, washed my hands, threw out
the water, and carried the body, the corpse, into
the garden to bury it. I buried it under a straw-
berry-plant. It will never be found. Every
morning I shall eat a strawberry from that plant.
Really, you can enjoy life when you know how.
My servant cried over his bird ; he thought it
had escaped. How should he suspect me ?
Ha, ha!
August 25. —I must kill a man. I must.
August SO.— lt is done. What a little thing
it is!
I went for a walk in the wood at Vernes. I
was thinking of nothing—nothing at all. There
was a child on the road, a little boy eating a slice
of bread and butter. He stopped to see me pass
and said—
“ Good morning, M’sieu President.”
The idea came into my head: “ Suppose I kill
him.”
I replied : “You are all alone, my boy ?”
“Yes, sir.”
“All alone in the wood ?”
“Yes, sir.”
The longing to kill him made me drunk as if
with wine. I approached him very gently, con-
vinced that he was going to run away. Then I had
him by the throat—l squeezed it, squeezed with
all my strength ! He stared at me with affrighted
eyes ! What eyes! Round, deep, limpid,
terrible ! Never have I known an emotion so
overpowering—but so short! He clutched my
wrists with his little hands, and his body writhed
like a feather on the fire. Then he moved no
more.
My heart beat, ah ! the bird’s heart! I threw
the body in a ditch, and grass upon it.
I went home and had a good dinner. What a
little thing it is ! At night I was very gay, light-
hearted, almost youthful. I spent the evening
with the prefect. They thought me brilliant.
But I did not see the blood !
August SO. —The corpse has been discovered.
They are hunting for the assassin.
September I. —Two tramps have been arrested.
The evidence is insufficient.
September 2. —The parents came to see me.
They were in tears. Ha, ha!
October 6. —Nothing has been discovered. Some
wandering vagabond must have done the deed.
Ha, ha ! If I had seen the blood flow I think I
should be calm now.
October 10.-—' The desire to kill has got into my
marrow. It is like the fever of love that tortures
you at twenty.
October 20. —Another ! I was walking along the
river bank after breakfast. Under a willow-tree
I saw a fisherman asleep. It was noon. There
was a spade in a neighbouring potato-field which
seemed to have been put there expressly. I went,
for it, and came back. I raised it like a club, and
with one blow of the edge I split open the fisher-
man’s head. Oh, he bled, that fellow! Red
blood, thick with brain ! It ran into the water,
trickling softly. I walked gravely away. If any-
one had seen me ? Ha, ha! I would have made
a splendid assassin.
October 25. —The affair of the fisherman has
made a great stir. The murder is attributed to
the nephew, who was fishing with him.
October 26. —The juge d’instruction* declares
that the nephew is guilty. Everyone in the town
believes it. Ha, ha !
October 27. —The nephew defends himself very
poorly. He had gone to the village to buy bread
and cheese, he says. He swears that his uncle
was killed during his absence ! Who will believe
such a story ?
October 28. —The nephew is so distracted that he
has almost confessed. Ha, ha ! Justice!
November 15. —They have overwhelming evi-
dence against the nephew, who was his uncle’s
heir. I will preside at the trial.
January, 25. —T0 death ! to death ! to death !
I have condemned him to death ! Ha, ha ! The
crown-prosecutor spoke like an angel! Ha, ha !
Another ! I shall go and see him executed !
March, 10. —It is over. They guillotined him
this morning. He is quite dead, quite! It is
delightful! How fine it is to see them slice off
a man’s head ! The blood spurted out in a
stream ! Oh, if I but could, I would have bathed
in it. What an intoxication it would be to lie
there, and get it in my hair and in my face,
and to get up red, all red ! Ah ! if they knew!
Now I shall wait; I can wait. It would take
such a little thing to have me caught.

Sydney
In an excursion train travelling between
Bundaberg and Brisbane, Q. —upwards of twelve
[ hours distance —the other day, the passengers
were only allowed out of the train —an ordinary
one, unprovided with conveniences—for twenty
minutes during the whole journey. The result is
some lively newspaper correspondence, and, it is
hoped, a lesson to the railway-commissioners.
The best-advertised man in the U.S. just
now is cne Dr. Whitney, of Chicago, who the
other day sewed up a terrible wound in the hand
of a casual patient, a poor man. He demanded
three dollars for the operation, but the man pos-
sessed only two, whereupon Whitney cursed him
and ripped up the wound again with a knife. The
patient fainted outside and was picked up by the
police. From what one reads about Whitney in
the Yankee press from New York right down to
New Orleans it would have been better for
Whitney that he had been lynched.
A gentleman famous as the discoverer of a
certain well-advertised N.Q. mine is now in Syd-
ney. The last time we saw this potentate, who
now appears to feel very well towards himself, was
at a Cloncurry ham-and-cgg banquet, on which
occasion he, assisted by a local celebrity known as
Poker Bill, wound up the festivities by heaving
the crockery and furniture out of the window and
pitching after them the Chinaman who did the
catering for the occasion. The distinguished
Northern visitor will no doubt regard the Sydney
whisky as being very mild after so long a course
of the copper-mine brand dispensed by Father
Lacey, of Cloncurry.
An honest and trustworthy ” young
Chinese in the employ of the Pest and • Telegraph
Department, at Port Darwin, has just confessed
to having stolen the 115 oz. of gold which lately
disappeared in transit. John Chinaman is an A 1
thief. The other day, at Pine Creek, N.T., a
European struck a rich patch of reef gold and
took a couple of buckets of the best out of it for
safety . These he put in his camp and slept along-
side them accompanied by two dogs and armed
with a revolver. In the morning the quartz was
all gone, but the revolver and clogs were in their
places. Not long ago some Chinese were caught
under rather ludicrous circumstances night-
thieving at Pine Creek. Ere going out on prowl
each Chow had put a bell around his neck and
provided himself with hobbles. This explained
how it had been that the European miners used to
lose their best s'one and yet heard no sounds even
if they remained awake all night save the tinkling
of bells and the rattling of the hobble-chains of
What they innocently supposed wore grazing
horses.

No medical man advertising in these colonies has medical
degrees which can be compared with his. Such eminent
qualifications, together with his recognised straightfor-
ward treatment, has naturally gained for him the reputa-
tion of being the
ONLY LEGALLY QUALIFIED DOCTOR
advertising in these colonies who combines with special
Knowledge Honest Treatment, as may easily be ascer-
tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony.
No diseases cause so much misery and distress as those
included in my speciality.
All Men Young and Old,
Suffering from the results of early follies or ex-
cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costiveness, palpi-
tation, singing and pains in the ears and head,
specks before the eyes, giddiness, weakened
memory, pains in the back'and chest, varicccele,
diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism, impure blood, weakening discharges, impaired
vigor,sterility, premature decay,stricture nervous-
ness, groundless fears, bashfulness, lassitude and
NERVOUS DEBILITY, should lose no tii’ne in
consulting him, since he has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at a distance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interruption to
their business, by giving a full and clear descrip-
tion of their symptoms, and the necessary medi-
cines will be forwarded to them. On receipt of

or of Is., his book on “ Nervous Debility.”
Dr. Alex. Paterson,
201 Macquarie Street North (opposite Parliament House)
There are four Melbourues, the other
three being in Derbyshire, United States, and
Canada.
In the present unsettled state of the Aus-
tralian legal profession it is interesting to note
that Governor Arthur (Y.D.L.) dismissed his
Attorney-General, J. T. Gellibrand, for unpro-
fessional conduct in drawing pleas for a plaintiff
and afterwards acting against him in court. The
Attorney-General’s conduct was vindicated by the
English bar. It was found that the first counsel
in England often acted against a retaining client
and sometimes drew pleas on both sides.
Dear Bulletin, - Herewith, another anec
dote of the thousand and oneth other great man*
As I remarked before, one ought to perpetuate
memoirs of great men while they are still alive. It
gives them a chance of telling the publisher that
he’s a prosecuting policeman. Here is an aco unit
of my little meeting with the now much-adver-
tised Sir Lepel Griffin. Ho wore a wreath of
smoke from a German china pipe, likewise a
smoking-cap, a velvet coat, and a pair of em-
broidered slippers. In the coolest way he pointed
at me with his pi pe-stem and asked Jim Alexander,
Major R. A., “ Who’s your friend ?” Now, Lepel
(not then Sir Lepel) was in an embroglio with Dr.
Leitner, editor of Public Opinion, published in
Lahore. The sore point was that Leitner had
referred to L.G. as ‘'an oiled Assyrian,” and
them was my sentiments. I could not help hear-
ing his question, so I took it on myself to answer,
“A greasy Babylonian.” Not much fun there,
but those were the only words I ever ad-
dressed to Sir L. G., except the single syllable
“ Done,” when lie offered to back Vedette against
The Cure. But I saw him again at the club table
d’hdte. Peace had been proclaimed, and jolly old
Leitner was proposing the health of Mr. Griffin
when the (alleged! Oiled Assyrian interjected,
“ Let us rather drink to the health of all honest
men; you may sit down, Dr. Leitner.” Of
course, when your health is drunk you are sitting,
but there was a nasty sneer in the tone. The
doctor ran round and slapped the speaker’s
cheek, not very hard, but it was a blow. Then
there was a row, and (I fancy we were winey) I
believe the doctor was off to his bunga’ow to get
his pistols, when ho fell into an open, deep drain
and broke his leg. How the leg an ! the matter
were patched up I never heard. — Hikam A biff.
LITTLE OF THE GUN NOTHING OF
THE DOG.
When Rip Van Winkle awoke from his nap in
the Catskill Mountains in America, lie found him-
self an old man. His dog was dead long ago, and
nothing was left of his gun but the lock and
barrel. And when he went back to the village of
Falling Water, where he used to live, nobody
recognised him. His wife, believing him dead",
had married an innkeeper. Right enough too,
for Rip had lain on the mountain-side, sound
asleep, for twenty years.
A long snooze ; but it seems to me I’d rather be
asleep half my life at a stretch than to stop awake
and be miserable. Yet here is a woman who says,
“ I can truthfully say that for eighteen years I
Was never free from pain for a single day.”
Mercy ! think of that. What a wretched way
to live! Yet I suppose millions of folk crawl
along through the world in that style. Not be-
cause they want to. Heavens, no ! But because
they can’t help it. This was her situation, and
an army of other women (besides crowds of men)
can sympathise with her.
She says : “For over twenty years I was weak
and sickly. At first I had a bad taste in the
mouth, poor appetite, and an uncomfortable feel-
ing at my chest and sides, and often tried to
obtain ease by holding my sides with my hands.
After eating I had grout pain ; it was like a load
at my chest, and I could not bear it until I
vomited all my food up. I would be quite faint
from the want of food but was afraid to cat. At
times I had bad attacks of spasms which nearly
doubled me up, and I rambled up and down the
house for hours together, for I could not even lie
down. Of course I lost a deal of sleep, and in a
morning was so weak and faint I scarcely knew
how to get out of bed and downstairs. For
eighteen years I was never free from pain for a
single day.
“ I saw doctor after do tor, and took a great
quantity of medicine without finding any real
relief. They would not say what was the cause of
my ailment. I was fast wasting away, and did
not think I could live much longer, when one day
in 1881 my husband heard from Mr. Joseph
Cooper, of Bourne, of a medicine called Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup, which he said had cured
him. ‘IfI am spared,’ I said to ray husband, ‘ I
will try it.’ I did so, and before I had taken the
first bottle I found relief, and after taking four
bottles more I was quite well and strong.
“ That is now ten years ago, and 1 have been in
good health ever since, taking just an occasional
dose of the syrup. After my recovery the clergy-
man said to my husband, “Your missis gets
about very different to what she used to do,’and
he told him that Mother Seigel’s Syrup had
wrought the cure. People tell me I look better
than I did twenty years ago, and I feel so strong
that I can now dig potatoes and do work with
anyone, notwithstanding I am 05 years of age.
“My husband suffered terribly from rheuma-
tism and flux, and has found wonderful benefit
from the same medicine. He says he would have
been in the churchyard long ago but for Mother
Seigel’s Syrup. For myself, I can say it saved my
life, and I wish others to know what it has done
for me and mine. (Signed) Mrs. Esther Ayr,
wife of William Ayr, of Thurlby, near Bourne,
Lincolnshire.”
In this brief and simple way Mrs. Ayr tells a
story the full details of which would fill a book.
What hopes and fears ! what hours of keen sorrow
and deep darkness she must have experienced.
Yes, indeed. None can even imagine it except
those who belong to the great Sisterhood of Suffer-
ing. Where she mentions one symptom of her
disease she actually could have named a dozen.
For her malady—the fearfully common and fatal
one, indigestion and dyspepsia—has as many signs
and forms as the mind has fancies, or the heavens
have clouds. From it, as from sin, come a thou-
sand pangs and pains to torment and to crush
helpless humanity. Seeing what her great dis-
covery has accomplished in this and multitudes of
like cases, how good a friend to her kind was
Mother Seigel! Rip Van Winkle awoke from his
nap to find himself old ; Mrs. Ayr awoke from her
long night of illness to find herself young again.
Is not the moral plain enough for all the suffering
millions in England ?

ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAB THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARE UNAWARE OP HIS'GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED PROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE

BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE..
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE FROM DISEASE, SEND POR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.

What folly it would be to cut grass with a pair of scissors I Yet peo-
ple do equally silly things every day. Modern progress has grown up
from the hooked sickle to the swinging scythe and thence to the lawn
mower. So don’t use scissors!
But do you use SAPOLIO ? If you don’t you are as much behind the
age as if you cut grass with a dinner knife. Once there were no soaps.
Then one soap served all purposes. Now the sensible folks use one soap
in the toilet, another in the tub, one soap in the stables, and SAPOLIO
for all scouring and house-cleaning.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Is everywhere recommended as the best rem-
edy for the cure of scrofula, scrofulous and
cancerous humors, chronic catarrh, eczema,
boils, pimples, sores, and all disorders origina-
ting in impure bloo.d. It neutralizes and elimi-
nates the acids that cause rheumatism, gout,
and dropsy. It regulates the liver and kidneys,
gives tone to the stomach, increases the appe-
tite, aids digestion,
Cures Dyspepsia,
and makes the weak strong. No other blood
purifier is composed of such carefully selected,
highly concentrated, and skilfully united in-
gredients. For nearly half a century this prep-
aration has, in both hemispheres, been the
standard tonic and strengthening medicine. It
is universally approved by the medical profes-
sion, and benefits the enfeebled system at all
seasons of the year.

(Fob The Bulletin.)
The clouds are wild in the western heaven,
The wind blows chill from the sea,
And the wan waves rise, and break, and rave
In endless monotony,
Like the pitiless fate that has touched with fire
My dead past life and me.
And the haggard eyes of the troubled past
Look out from the storm-tossed spray,
On a present as sombre and dull and drear
As the mist on the breast of the bay ;
for I have no faith in the life I live,
No faith in the light of the day.
I have fiercely fought, and ever failed
In the world with its selfish throng,
Where the weak are trodden beneath the heel
Of the tyrannous power of the strong.
Where that which is false is heeded most -
Where right is governed by wrong.
Where in years long gone I sowed the seed
Such a bitter fruit has borne—
A harvest of sadness and sorrow and pain,
Of cherished hopes rudely torn,
Of broken faiths and loves long fled,
And roses that hide the thorn.
And o’er my pain-smitten life there looms
A future all lone and grey,
Which bears in its breast the fruit of sins,
Of the years that have passed away—
Which menaces ever in language harsh,
In W'ords that I cannot say.
Still the distance a golden halo lends,
A wavering shadowy grace.
Shaded with change and a darkened past
And deeds that were wrong and base,
And out from this endless chaos gleams
A woman’s marvellous face.
A radiant face as fearless and fair
As the gleaming summer skies
With the last sweet scent of faded flowers—
From the shadow seems to rise,
With the glittering light upon her hair,
The luminous light in her eyes.
The storm wraok lowers, the sea rolls on,
And breaks in the swelling bay ;
The faith from my heart forever has fled,
What more can 1 do or say ?
For I have no faith in the life I live—
No faith in the light of the day.
Brisbane, Aug. 10.
H. E. P. M'DONALD.
Two years ago an experiment was started
at Thursday Island (Q.) for the production of
pearls by artificial means, and the scheme has
turned out a success. By setting up a process of
complicated irritation the unhappy oyster is made
to grow pearls against his will, which is remark-
ably good for the grower, and remarkably bad for
the oyster. The Bulletin would like that whole-
souled philanthropist, Mr. E. J. H. Knapp, of
Sydney, to look into this matter. Brutality to an
oyster is just .about ten degrees worse than
brutality to a horse, for the oyster can’t kick,
neither can it bolt. The tinned oyster is a tender
and delicate vision, and should be treated with
kindness ; and the oyster stew is a reflective thing
which sits and thinks at the bottom of the sea.
The brutal, sordid speculator who would inflict
life-long suffering on this gentle and soft-voiced
fruit is a degraded wretch and unfit to live—a
being hardened by the love of gain and debased
by greed. Anybody who tries to perpetrate any
such outrage on an oyster in our vicinity must
climb over our dead body to do it.
The Bulletin rises to suggest the urgent
necessity for a reform in the matter of con-
spiracies. It is moved to make this proposal by
the dire monotony of that shearers’insurrectionary
plot about which the Queensland press is still
raving at intervals. The Bulletin doesn’t know
and doesn’t care whether there ever was any plot
at all, but if there was it was a remarkably
-clumsy one, else it would either have succeeded in
one jump, or it would have failed quietly, and no
one would ever have heard anything about it.
The amateur conspirator, in fact, is a failure, and
he can’t conspire worth a rap. Therefore it has
occurred to us that there should be a good opening
for a limited liability company which would
always keep on hand a staff of trained and
efficient conspirators, and conduct nefarious
plots on a fixed percentage. The chief essentials
for the business are a stock of dark lanterns and
slouched hats, and a capacity for making signals
in cypher and hovering mysteriously at obscure
corners, and interring compromising documents in
cellars at midnight; and the company would under-
take all these branches of the business and conduct
them in a way that would give general satisfaction.
Corners would be mysteriously hovered at with
punctuality and industry, and at the lowest
current rates, and two or more corners would be
hovered at on reduced terms. In the case of
anybody who wanted to get up a conspiracy on
the plan adopted by the lamented G. Fawkes, the
company would undertake to stand in a cellar and
look gloomily at a stack of coals if required. A
quantity of collars would be “stood in” at cut
rates. Treasonable telegrams would be despatched
and received, and compromising documents buried
secretly at midnight and afterwards discovered
through the agency of the company’s own base
deceiver. Base deceivers would be supplied at a
surprising reduction on all previous quotations.
Oaths would be administered, and bones found,
also dark alleys and ruined buildings lurked in
suspiciously. Owing to its long experience
of the trade, the company is convinced
that it could lurk in a way that no
private firm could compete with, and look
more suspicious than anybody ever previously
heard of. Dynamite would be heaved, at a mere
shade over cost price, at the company’s own im-
perial tyrant, who would be always at the office
from nine till four—on Saturdays nine till one;
republics proclaimed by private arrangement ;
seditious pamphlets always kept in stock, and the
characters of the minions of despotism blasted by
contract. If necessary, Freedom would shriek
when Kosciuscko fell Kosciuscko always on
hand. Insurrections got up, either with or with-
out bloodstained massacre, at the shortest notice.
The cadaverous office patriot would languish on a
straw bed in a dungeon after the conspiracy
burst, and utter moral sentiments through the
window to the weeping multitude and make them
groan at the bloated autocrat. Bloated autocrat
furnished on shortest notice. Terms, spot cash or
marked cheque.

During the height of the Palmer rush
enormous prices were charged for supplies, and
the queerest tricks were resorted to for the pur-
pose of quitting certain goods for which there
proved to be no demand. One of the first store-
keepers to arrive brought as part of his stock a
large quantity of horse-shoe nails and rubbed his
hands in delight when he heard that his was the
only supply on the field. However, there was no
demand for the nails, and the clever speculator
found himself “had.” The miners got wind of
the fact and rubbed their hands in the joyful
belief that for once the biter had been bitten, and
so every man who visited the store asked in a
casual, satirical sort of way if the boss “ had any
nails ” ? But Shylock grinned grimly and
answered not. By and bye the storekeeper’s
opportunity came witli what threatened to be a
Hour-famine. He had the only stock of flour, and
calmly announced that, pending further arrange-
ments, all persons buying at his establishment
would have to take a pound of horse shoe
nails with eacli and every 10 pounds of flour.
Loud were the curses, but the men could
not help themselves. In fact, they were “had”
over and over again. They couldn’t see the
force of humping horse-shoe nails over the‘stony
ridges between the store and their camps ; so, as
each man left the store he would throw away his
thare of the nails, and then the nigger hired for
that purpose by the boss, would gather them up
and have them in readiness for the next applicant
for damper-foundation with horse-nail trimmings.
The scheme worked for a while, only some of the
men got suspicions, and finally comprehending the
sell they induced the merchant to administer a
dose of nails to an abandoned shaft, said dose
consisting of all his remaining stock.
The same old story. At Brighton (Eng.)
the other day John Muspratt, a Cambridge
graduate in divinity, got into trouble for brutally
assaulting and threatening to murder a girl who
had refused to marry him. He was released on
promising “ to go to Australia and not return for
three years.” The British beak is always ready
to let off the British blackguard if he will promise
to go to Australia, and, under our grand old Con-
stitution, there is no means by which the said
blackguard can be kept out. The procession keeps
on coming with never a stoppage. The advance
guard consists of a great array of cancer patients,
and consumptives, and individuals with livers
all awry and diseased kidneys. Then behind them
marches, a hundred or so abreast, the vast army
of expatriated drunkards with b'eared eyes and
shattered hats, arid the big battalions of bounced
lunatics, who have been shunted just ere their
disease became too conspicuous. Still they come.
Then tin re is a rolling tide of wife-beaters,
forgers, small embezzlers, brutal-assault men, and
all the miscellaneous gang who were short in their
cash, and who undertook to go to good old Austra-
lia instead of going to gaol. And at the tail-end of
the horde come the phalanx of assorted bigamists,
the Sunday-school snufflers who had led the choir
astray, the escaped pastors who have left with the
trust funds, and the Irish informer with a tumour
in his stomach. They are a gaudy crowd, all
loafers, all bent on looking after the ‘‘silken
bonds,” and all dreadfully in need of a cwt. of
pig-iron as a sinker, and then a drop into the
fathomless sea.
The Marriage of Metals.
A MARVELLOUS SAVING OF LABOUR AND TlMv
SILENCE AND SPEED A SPECIALTY. *“
A MACHINE THAT WELDS IRON AND BRASS
THE ELECTRIC WELDING COMPANY. ’
The welding machine can be seen daily at th.
Exhibition Buildings, Melbourne, Saturday!
excepted. It is in charge of Mr. Thomas T
Hraper, who is explaining its working on behalf
of the Electric Welding Company.
It has attracted a great deal of attention from
practical men, real ironworkers, who gain thpL
living by the sort of work they were witnessing
and their verdict is unanimous— summed un
one word—marvellous. 1 1
To the ordinary layman, the average represents,
ti ve of the intelligent public, it was a silent puzzle
It performed such unquestionably clever wort
with so little of the bustle and noise that aecom-
panics the old-fashioned method of the smithy
and only taking a few seconds where 15 minute
had been requisite.
The welding is accomplished without noise or
hammering. There was no bier anvil and rust
strewn floor, no smoky smithy with ponderous
bellows and bed of coal; but merely a machine
which might have been a sewing machine, and
which was tended by a young man in the guise of
a clerk m a fashionable suit of clothes, with a
pendant watch chain. There was an absence of
the muscular village blacksmith, and his leathern
apron and the flying sparks. The whole apparatus
might have been located in a lady’s draw ing-rooni
and even the conversation need not have been
interrupted.
Lying about were samples of the work done •
steel, iron, brass, even lead, welded together, and
the most difficult problems solved satisfactorily
Tor instance, one of the jobs which have long been
desirable, but regarded as impracticable, has been
the joining of fractured tram-cables. Tins has
now been accomplished by the electric welder.
Hitherto when a cable parted the only way of
joining was by the splice, which, however neatly
performed, was necessarily cumbrous. Now the
process is so simple that a child could do it. It i s
only necessary to saw off the ends evenly, brino-
the pieces together, and turn a switch. The
electric current is responsible for the repairs. For
a second or so, possibly 10, the wire ends for the
distance of an inch on each side of the joint in-
crease in brilliancy till they glow'. A lever is
pulled meanwhile, so as to effect the union, and
the weld is complete with the turning off of the
current.
Nothing could be simpler to look at, nothing
more interesting; and to the expert, accustomed to
old methods, it is little short of miraculous. The
principle involved in the new art is that of
causing currents of electricity to pass through the
abutting ends of the pieces of metal which are to
be welded, thereby generating heat at the point of
contact, which also becomes the point of greatest
resistance, while at the same time mechanical
pressure is applied to force the parts together,
with the advantage that the interior of the joint
T! a f efficiently united as the visible exterior.
With such a method and apparatus, it has been
found possible to accomplish not only the common
kinds of welding of iron and steel, but also of
metals which have heretofore resisted attempts at
welding, and have had to be be brazed or
soldered. As regards strength it has beeli
demonstrated that the weld is the last point
at which the iron breaks under the severest tests.
The variety of uses to which this method
applies is almost endless, ranging from the
welding of heavy cables to jewellers’ chains, and
being suitable lor soldering, brazing, shaping,
forging, riveting, and bending of metals, no
matter of what kind. The machines of the
Electric Welding Company possess the character-
istics of simplicity of instruction and adapta-
bility to an almost eu ft® list of requirements in
the metal-working business, including even the
tempering of springs and the welding of dissimilar
metals. Like many other new inventions, it
comes from America, and the success which its
production has met with oyer in the United States
bids fair to be repeated in Australasia, judging
from the favourable criticisms of those most
capable of judging, the practical iromvorkers who
have examined its operations in Melbourne.
As regards the commercial side of this electric
welder, it is proposed to supply the machines to
the trade on lease, merely charging for the work
actually performed, as in addition to its other
ingenious qualities it automatically registers the
number of welds performed by it.
The prospectus will be shortly issued, and there
appears to be a successful future for the opera-
tions of the company.

gWORX CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 188 S.
To H. P. Kugelmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but 1 became worse every day, wasting away until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
chd of three months I was taken had one morning, and
yomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty’s
Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
County of Grant, this 10th dav of December, 1888.
