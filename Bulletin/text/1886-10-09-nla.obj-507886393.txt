THE BULLETIN.
SATURDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1886.
Down on the Bed-rock.
With characteristic vehemence and with
lestionable taste—also characteristic, the
ydney Press has seized upon the “ Mount
Rennie outrage” as a text for most extrava-
antly-worded sermons upon city larrikinism,
.. id with similar unseemly haste the pulpits
have followed in the same violent strain.
: Inch as we applaud the righteous indigna-
‘ ion of these authorities, we are still unable
i i perceive that they have noticed the most
i nportant lessons taught by Sydney out-
ages, or that they have dilated upon more
Wan half the truth revealed by this ghastly
spectacle of wrecked and ruined woman-
hood. To invoke the hangman and the
logger as allies of maidenly innocence
against the “lower classes,” is consistent
nough for those who hold that the weapons
of legal savagery alone can cure human
depravity ; but to charge the degraded lar-
rikin with full responsibility for the utter
uin of these women, the ultimate victims of
-ruel assault, or to brand them as the only
dimers against the social code, is to misinter-
pret the testimony of evident facts. All the
outrages ” recorded in Sydney’s annals go
to prove—That when lawless men of the
lowest class jointly assault a woman
their victim is always one who has
already been hurled to the very depths
of social depravity, while, on the other
iiand, the victim of “ gentlemen,”
co-operating in similar fashion, is usually
■lure till subjected to their pollution. A
. bird conclusion drawn from daily observa-
tion is that virtuous and modest girls of any
age or station have nothing to fear from lar-
rikins, but are in constant danger of being
insulted, wronged, and ruined by men in the
garb of gentlemen—we use the word in its
conventional sense.
In briefly reviewing the most noticeable o:
Sydney crimes consummated by gangs o:
brutal men, it is necessary to obliterate th
fanciful distinction made by the press between
“ assaults” committed by “ gentlemen” anc
“ brutal outrages” chargeable to “larrikins.
The cases, except in the virtue of the victims
are almost identical in motive, manner
cruelty, and disgrace. First on the shame
ful list is the North Shore case of some year
ago. Here the victim was an innocent girl
while her assailants belonged to the respect
able classes. The latter, seven in number
were all convicted on the capital charge, anc
condemned to death, but the sentences were
commuted and all of the prisoners have since
been released. Some of them at the presen
moment are shedding the delicate aroma o
their aristocracy in patrician circles, ant
those who have uncles in the Assembly are
most likely serving their country by drawing
monthly salaries from the public Treasury
The next in point of time was at Woolloo-
mooloo, and perpetrated by larrikins. The
woman, Elizabeth Phillips, whose death,
while lying drunk on a mound of gar-
bage in a city slum, was accelerated
by the savagery of her assailants,
had already sunk about as low as a woman
could sink in shame. Her last persecutors
merely thrust her out a little deeper, and she
died. But who led her to the edge of that
reeking slough ? Once her feet, we presume,
were set in the paths of virtue, and she was,
as many who saw her but a few years since
can testify, an exceedingly beautiful woman.
Who first Jed her astray only two or three
can toll, but half Sydney knows that in the
early days of her disgrace she was the mis-
tress of an exceedingly well-paid Civil ser-
vant, who, in his official capacity, had to
indirectly assist in the prosecution of those
whose alleged violence closed her worthless
life. When cast off by this gentleman she
was for some time “ kept ” by a distinguished
member of Sydney society —an aristocrat
whose record seems to be no bar to his entry
into the most exclusive circles. Abandoned
by him, Elizabeth Phillips went down hill
with fearful velocity, and when her name
was mentioned as one who had died on an
ash-heap in Woolloomooloo many men could
scarce believe it to be the same woman who
had so recently been accustomed to drive a
stylish roan pony in a neat little buggy
through. Sydney streets. Who betrayed
Elizabeth Phillips the virtuous wo know
not ; who assisted the downward career of
the beautiful Elizabeth Phillips is widely
known ; it was only the effigy of Elizabeth
Phillips, deprived of \ irtue, grace, beauty,
and all else that could attract, which the
filthy larrikin ultimately consumed. Who
most sinned against the woman ? The men
who robbed her of the sum of endowments
which made her “a little lower than the
angels,” or the men who at the last took
from her the life which alone was left to
her ?
* * *
Closely akin to this affair at Woolloo-
mooloo was the Mount Carmel outrage,
similar in the class of persons guilty of its
commission, and only differing as far as its
victim was concerned in her list of previous
protectors.
* * *
Turning from contemplation of such larri-
kin outrages, we arc impelled to notice some
alleged crimes said to have been committed
by gentlemen. Of these the Hunter’s Beach
case is perhaps the most instructive. Two
young girls were persuaded to go out
sailing one evening by two gentlemen.
Next morning a boat was moored at
Hunter’s Beach, and one of the girls
complained to a policeman that she and
her friend had been criminally assaulted.
Arrests were made of the alleged assailants,
and the case came before the St. Leonards
Police Court. The evidence of a doctor and
the policeman was taken, and • then the en-
quiry was adjourned. When again called
on, it was found that the remaining witnesses
for the Crown were unwilling to give their
evidence. No steps whatsoever w T ould seem to
have been taken to prevent interested parties
from arranging matters with the hostile
witnesses, and the prisoners were set at
liberty without more ado, notwithstanding
that the most brutal violence had been em-
ployed in the commission of the capital
offence. Both defendants were reported to
have been well-connected, and possessed of
considerable influence. Here we quote from
the Sydney Globe, which writes of the
Mount Rennie prisoners :
“If there were the slightest suspicion that jus-
tice would be baffled in this case, which, as the
perpetrators are not influential, is extremely un-
likely&c., &c.
The Hunter’s Beach defendants were influen-
tial. ' They were gentlemen, and the out-
raged girl w r as, according to the testimony of
the doctor, a man in the first rank of his pro-
fession, indubitably pure immediately prior to
that little excursion. If public suspicion be
correct as to the circumstances of this case, it
goes to prove our rule that gentlemen
usually select virtuous girls when they co-
operate in crime,
y'r *
Another alleged case in point is the North
Harbour mystery. Its incidents are toler-
ably familiar. Elizabeth Brown was in-
duced by an accomplished ‘ ‘ lady friend” to go
down on a little afternoon excursion to the
camp of Messrs. Griffiths and James near
Manly. The story for the defence is that
the girls missed the return steamer, and the
quartette spent the hours from teatime till
something after midnight resting upon separ-
ate couches, and beguiling the hours by
philosophical conversation of an improving
character. Then the girl Brown care-
lessly strolled out of the tent, and was
not seen again till they found her outraged
body, bereft of life, on the adjacent beach.
We cannot say that either of the well-con-
nected gentlemen—one was a Civil Sen ant,
the other a merchant’s clerk—or the lady
friend, know anything of the crime that had
been certainly committed, but would point out,
for the purposes of our argument, that
the examining surgeon’s evidence pointed to
the fact that impurity had not before that
night been a blemish of the girl’s life. With
the Mount Rennie affair we cannot at the
time of writing deal: while the matter is before
the courts we prefer not to prejudice the case
of the accused men as our journalistic and
clerical contemporaries have done.
So much at present for our first and second
points, and in support of the third, viz., that
modest and virtuous girls of whatever station
in life have more reason 'to fear the insults
and vice of men in the higher than in the
lower social grades, we would ask what man
in Sydney is the greatest pest, annoyance,
and danger to innocent girlhood ? The same
answer will come to many lips. He is a
member of Parliament, who by some credu-
lous persons is still esteemed a model of rec-
titude. A nocturnal street-prowler, and a
libertine of the most remorseless order, his
very glance directed at a faithful wife or at
her twelve-year-old daughter in the public
streets is a blasphemy against female virtue.
His presence in the House is a libel on re-
sponsible government and an indelible dis-
grace to his constituents, and the father
whose young daughter is ruined by his
agency would be committing a crime against
womanly purity by consenting to suffer the
wrong to be smothered in shameful silence.
And who is the next greatest social pest ?
Another M.P., who, although a married
man, drags his wife’s honour through the
mire in his unrelenting attack upon the in-
nocence of girlhood. And who next ? It
is difficult to tell. There are so many
human blow-flies in all the professions that
it is almost impossible to assign priority in
blackguardism to any of them.
* * *
And of the lesser offences against woman-
hood, those which may be classed as insults
and annoyances, men of the more refined
rank are by no means guiltless. It is a fact
easily provcable by observation that a modest
girl may walk unaccosted past expectorating
bands of foul-mouthed larrikins in the worst
purlieus of Woolloomooloo, for the typi-
cal hoodlum molests only those on or below
his own moral plane and intuitively sees all
the forces of law and of society arrayed be-
hind the decent woman who does not
dawdle. But in George-street, Sydney,
after dusk there would be much more to fear
from the gentlemen to whom the enlighten-
ment of female ignorance is a life-work. The
use of the word “gentlemen” here may
seem to be obviously incorrect, yet in ac-
cordance with common usage it is not so, for
as society is now constituted a ‘ ‘ man of posi-
tion ” does not cease to be a gentleman when
he becomes a blackguard. This fact is at the
root of the immorality of the age. A prince
who makes a tour through the colonies with a
squad of mondaines at his heels is still effusively
welcomed and admired by the overwhelming
majority of persons who are more loyal to
royalty than to virtue ; a Lonsdale does not
cease to be a welcome companion of bishops
because he happens to be a publicly-pro-
claimed adulterer ; a Dxlke coming to Aus-
tralia would be worshipped by society though
all the allegations against his honour were
believed ; and the notorious libertine, if he
be rich, and careful of his dress, need not
fear to meet with a cold reception in the
halls of the fashionable, and need not want
for a wife, so long as that misery-breeding
proverb that ‘ ‘ married rakes make the best
of husbands” is still believed and acted upon.
* * *
If any effective reform of the social evil is
to be made, it must commence by the adop-
tion of the truth that a blackguard cannot
lay claim to the privileges of gentlemen.
Sermons will be preached in vain, the authori-
ties will, in the words of the immortal
Knapp, “ cat, cut and cauterize” to no pur-
pose, and Social Purity societies will uselessly
work for the expulsion of suggestive pictures
from tobacconists’ windows so long as seduc-
tion is considered as the sport of gentlemen,
and so long also as the bishops and Lonsdales,
the Fitz-Smyths and Dtlkes, walk arm-in-
arm together. Until the social system is
completely changed in its treatment of such
offenders, outrages will ever be rife ; it is
useless to try to enforce virtue by lashing
the larrikin into decency. He is but the
final result of a mammon-worshipping social
system. While he sees that reputed aristo-
crats, his superiors in rank, are wont to
occupy their spare time in seduction and
adultery, with the tacit approval of the
powers that be, the larrikin will consider it
a proof of gentle breeding to go and do like-
wise, and in pursuing this resolution he will
from time to time mightily shock the refined
ones by his coarseness of method. Let us go
right down to the bed-rock of the subject.
The outrages-of Mount Carmel and Woolloo-
mooloo are but the outcome of the system
which permits seduction to be ranked as the
pastime of gentlemen.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Bloomsbury Bishop.
The one class of immigrants more hurtful to Aus-
tralia than the wall-eyed Chinaman is that
which includes foreigners who come out here as
governors, their flunkeys, and bishops. Aliens in
sentiment and habit, the governors make it their
one aim to degrade Australian aspirations to a low
Imperial level. Each one, unless his genius con-
fines itself to money-grubbing, deems it his mis-
sion to help grovelling colonists who wish to sell
the birthright of their land for a paltry mess of
Imperial pottage. Each of them wishes to make
the colony which pays him a weak imitation of
England, with himself as its gingerbread king.
Broken-down roues, insolvent lordlings, and aris-
tocratic duffers are sent out as Imperial Bagmen,
and so far the colonies have born the infliction
with a patience that is more a vice than a virtue.
Similarly, it has hitherto been the practice to go
into tho highways and byways of the English
Church to worry up all the bishops required for
colonial use. The latest result of this practice is
seen in the appointment of the Rev. Field
Flowers Groe, or Goe, as some messages have
it, to the See of Melbourne. For months past
Hennxker Heaton, Sir Graham Berry, and
others have been searching for some servant of the
Nazarene willing to sacrifice himself for £2OOO a
year, but for some time no clerical Pooh-Bah
was discovered whose family pride yearned
for a cash insult of this description. The
present nominee was on the list considered by the
Sydney committee when the local diocese was
without a head, but his nomination was thrown
out on the first ballot. Therefore Melbourne, in this
case, takes the mansummarily rejected by Sydney.
That, however, is a small matter ; the real evil is
that tho SouJ.e.-n cj'.ony will bo governed in
Church affairs by a man whose 55 years spent in
England have materially impaired his pow er of
adapting himself to altered conditions. Imbued with
English ideas, saturated with English prejudices,
and governed in his judgment of men and things
by the rules applicable in England, he will, on his
arrival, be as capable of mismanaging the busi-
ness of his diocese as his predecessors have been.
It is an offshoot of the disgraced and corrupt
Church in England that he will try to maintain
here, not a vigorous organisation suited to the
freedom of the country, and the wants of its
people. So long as the Anglican Church here
is bound to the English model, so long will it be
barren of influence and benefit, and while Eng-
lish bishops are imported any substantial reforma-
tion is impossible, To import Bloomsbury bishops
for the Anglican Church is as unjust and mis-
chievous as to bring over shiploads of Irish and
Italian firebrands and fanatics for the Romish
church; in either case the importation tends to
alienate the sect from the sympathies of Aus-
tralians,

Drunk!
“Another disgraceful scene in the Now South
Wales Legislative Assembly,”—this is a standing
heading in the Sydney daily newspaper offices.
Once or twice a week a virtuously-indignant
Press relates, with an amusing air of surprise,
how one honorable member, in the course of what
is facetiously termed “debate,” referred to his
friend, the honorable member opposite, in terms
which even a pious Jew would in his wrath re-
frain from applying to a hog, and how certain
other honorable members then joined in the ob-
scene fray and brought about “something like a
pothouse brawl.” Now, why does not the daily
Press —say the S.M. Herald, which pays its two
proprietors about £250 a day. for guarding the
public interests—why does not the Sydney Morn ,
ing Herald, which is always in the Assembly
Chamber, and is perfectly well aware of the true
state of things, say the word right out ? “ Drunk ! ”
is the word. There are in the Legislative Assem-
bly of New South Wales several members who are
always—let us use plain Saxon—in a beastly state
of “ booze.” They are men who dare not attempt
to put on their boots until they have environed at
least three whiskies apiece, and each morn-
ing they arise to rebuke a Divine ITovi
dence which has ordained that the head of
the drunkard shall until midday be six
sizes larger than his hat. In the House they
snore, and drivel, and hiccup, all the time. When
they are comatose they hold their heads down and
slobber, just like the ordinary drunkard who has
not been raised by the vote of the intelligei.t
elector to the high and holy office of a member of
Parliament; when they are excited they become
delirious; and when they are so much less drunk
than usual that they are able to walk past the
Speaker and bow to him without upsetting their
physical balance, the medical members of the
House nudge each other in the ribs and say :
“ Tut-tut! Just look at him—hopelessly alcohol-
ised —what a post-mortem he’ll make! ” A com-
mittee, consisting, say, of Doctors Tarrant,
Renwick and Mackellar, M's.P., should at once
be appointed -to report as to th°fitness of
the most notorious of the Parliamentary
sots of New South Wales to remain out-
side the walls of an Asylum for Hopeless
Drunkards. And when the committee have re-
ported, the drunkards should be handed over to
Dr. Creed, M.L.C., in the interests of experi-
mental cremation. They’d burn like blazes.
♦
Princely Piety.
The Melbourne Age, in a recent isiuo, devoted
a leading article to a comparison between the
Scotch strictness of the Sabbath as observed in
Melbourne and the fashion in which of late it has
been possible to spend this day in Sydney. The
Age doesn’t quite know what to make of it.
Melbourne is the capital of the most Radical
colony in Australia, and Sydney the head-centre
of Conservatism, yet the Conservative capital has
its Sunday music-halls and concerts, whereas in
the home of Australian Radicalism men and
women must seek their Sunday amusement in
church or go without any. The explanation of
the anomaly which so puzzles the Age appears to
us very accessible. It is to bo found in the in-
fluence exerted, unconsciously perhaps, but Hill
exerted, by the principal daily newspapers of
Sydney. In the first place, each of our morning
papers being conducted by clergymen, the normal
appetite of the average citizen for sermons is fully
satiated during the week by the perusal of these
productions every morning under the thin and
transparent disguise of leading articles. In the
second place, one of the morning dailies insidi-
ously undermines the pulpit and saps its vitality
at the very tap-root—pew-rents—by publishing
every Monday morning the alleged pith of theser,
mons preached on Sunday. There is consequently on
the part of its readers no necessity to go to church
at all. But still more virulent is the attack
upon Sabbath observance made by the S. M.
Herald. That journal is still pious in some
features. Its occasional efforts at sparkling
writing, for example, positively reek of Scriptural
derivation and deep solemnity. But its Piety has
of late been much subordinated to its Loyalty. The
Herald still patronises the Almighty with a good
deal of unaffected condescension, but it worshii s
the Prince of Wales and all the Royal Family.
And only the other day it informed its readers
that the Most Holy the Heir to the Throne habi-
tually held extremely pleasant Sunday evening
parties at which music by distinguished artists,
and an occasional carpet-dance, and fun generally,
were indulged in. Now as the S.M. Herald has
uniformly preached in its daily sermons that no
member of the Royal Family can by any means
whatever do wrong, the inference impressed upon
its readers is necessarily that it is right and even
commendable to spend the Sabbath evening in
entertainments and gaiety ministered to by pro-
fessional ladies and gentlemen more or less con-
nected with the stage and concert platform. Con-
sequently the moral perceptions of its readers
have been so obscured that they no longer see
with clearness the infamy of similar amusements
being provided for loyal and devoted worshippers
of the Queen, God bless her, and the Royal
Family, in the theatres of Sydney. We hasten to
furnish an antidote against this deplorable cor-
ruption. There is a sharp and clear distinction
between the Prince’s entertainments and ;those in
Sydney. His Royal Highness is too deeplj' imbued
with Kerristian conviction and genuine piety ever
to so far forget his duty to his Maker as to make
a charge at the door ! There you have the essence
of true religion in a nutshell, and we call upon
the authorities to enforce, without a moment’s de-
lay, all the severit es of the act of Charles 11. of
pious memory, against persons who give Sunday
entertainments without being provided by the
State with a sufficient income to give them free of
charge.

Wales’ Upheaval.
The snobbish effort to ra s so, by means of
two-guinea subscriptions, a of plate
for the Prince of Wales has ignominiously collapsed,
and Wales has at last begun to comprehend that
even the most faithful and devoted of colonists do
not think his “distinguished services” worth
forty-two shillings of legal tender. But Wales
spent so much time in assimmilating this fact that it

became difficult for him to retreat from his posi-
tion with dignity. It was necessary to decline the
absent testimonial, for which he had so obviously
been waiting, and to state that under no circum-
stances could he dream of accepting a subscription
which, to judge from present appearances, could
only be made to look respectable by being changed
into copper and fetched along in a wheel-barrow.
Yet had Wales to thank the grovelling promoters
for their ghastly failure, and to say that he
“deeply appreciated” their compliment. The
subscriptions are to be transferred to the Colonial
and Indian Institute, and will probably
suffice to pay a fortnight’s salary to
the janitor of that establishment. The empire
on ((which the sun of slush-born loyalty
never sets is convulsed with delight at Walks’
generosity ; and a hundred naked tribes are now
filled with solemn joy because the Prince has
refused a testimonial which he couldn’t get, and
announced that he feels compelled to decline a
gift which nobody has offered to him. Over the
length and breadth of the globe the news has been
spread. The Digger Indian heard it while feebly
prospecting for wild carrots, and, abandoning his
chase after that subterranean vegetable, he sat
down to admire a man who would reject such an
offering, and thus throw away the chance of
acquiring at one fell swoop enough carrots to last
a life time; the Maori prophet heard it and is
more than ever convinced that “the potato is
cookedthe information was flashed to Hong
Kong, and the Chinaman there thinks of deposing
Joss in favour of the obese son of Victoria
Regina. But even a British Prince cannot well take
coppers, especially in the present instance, when
no coppers are available, and Wales has, there-
fore, perpetrated a sudden moral upheaval which
will place his name on the eternal page of history
alongside that of the most self-sacrificing heroes
of antiquity.
Fat and Lazy.
“ We are grown fat and lazy,” the Spectator
says, meaning by “we” the people of England,
and in relation to manufactures. Germany is
heading us in foreign trade, underselling us in the
markets of the world, and the reason is that Ger-
many is full of vigour and energy while w r e have
become “fat and lazy.” So it is written in all the
bald simplicity of utter falsity, and is it not re-
markable evidence of the truth of that old Scriptu-
ral prophecy, “ The Lord shall send you a strong
delusion, and ye shall believe a lie.” The Free-
trade of the Spectator is a strong delusion in-
deed, and the statement of the fatness and laziness
of the manufacturers of England is the gross and
palpable lie. Fat and lazy ! Why, at the time
that article was written artisans and manufac-
turers’ hands in England were starving by tens of
thousands —starving because of Free trade, starving
because, following the strict rules of political
economy purchasers of all classes of goods went
to Germany where men work twelve hours a day,
and to Belgium where men, women, and children
work sixteen, rather than to England where,
through the emancipation wrought by trades’
unions and against all the efforts of the most
strenuous advocates of Freetrade, a reasonable
proportion of the day has been secured for rest.
Doubtless some fat and lazy manufacturers looked
at the starving, and said : —-“ They will come to
by and bye. A little more hunger, a little more
cold, and we shall have them at our own terms.
They can’t emancipate the whole world, these
trades unionists, and under our glorious system of
Freetrade we can array the whole world against
them.” It need hardly be said that the Sydney
Daily Telegraph takes the “fat and lazy”
theory of the Spectator as sound, and preaches on
it as an actual and demonstrable fact.
If there is one man in Australia who has a deeper
and holier reverence for free ads., or shows more
conspicuous ability in landing them than the
Anglican Bishop of Sydney, we must humbly con-
fess that wo are as yet ignorant of his address.
Some pretty gorgeous things in the free ad. line
are done by circus-agents, theatrical managers,
and liver-pill men, but the very best of them are
beaten in a walk at their own game by “ Alfred
Sydney.” One device which is very dear to him
—or rather cheap to him and dear to the news-
paper man —was worked to a large extent last
week, when there appeared in the Evening News
a miserable little five-line ad. under “ Wanted,”
inviting applications for the billet of sub-matron
at the Church Home. By itself the announce-
ment would have attracted a strictly limited
amount of attention, but that the Bishop con-
tributed to the same issue of the paper an
ingeniously-worded letter alluding to the
vacancy, awarding a quantum of praise
to the “ present excellent matron,” detail-
ing the qualities indispensable to her suc-
cessor, and incidentally stating that his Lord-
ship graciously condescends to concur in the
opinion of some one or other. The letter alto-
gether occupies just ten times the space of the
ad., and it must remain an open question whether
the letter was written by Alfred Sydney for the
sake of the ad., or the ad. paid for to enable the
insertion of the letter. Either explanation is
creditable to his Lordship, more especially as he
worked the same racket on all the other Sydney
papers on the same date, and makes a practice of
getting at them similarly whenever he condescends
to subsidise them to the extent of a shilling in
advertising any church biz. Alfred’s ingenuity
in getting his sermons printed is too notorious to
be worth a notice here, and after considering the
marvellous strategy of this good Bishop we are
forced to the conclusion that the time when the
“ children of the world ” used to get ahead of the
“ children of light” passed away for ever as soon
as Alfred Sydney cut his eye teeth. His Lord-
ship yanks the biscuit on the free ad. racket any-
how, even from such scientists in the same line as
“the much-travelled” Zulu Thompson, Lily
Langtry, and Warner’s Safe Cure man.
What of Gurth the Thrall of Cedric?
This letter is the letter of a thinker.
Perhaps he has not thought very far, and perhaps,
too, the thoughts are from his heart as well as
from his head. Nevertheless, the germ of a great
ideal may be seen in the column he has written :
Editor Bulletin. —Sir, —Every form of litera-
ture that has attempted to defend what is left to
the workman of his natural right, or that has
tried to rouse him into exerting himself to recover
the rights filched from him and hidden away like
stolen goods by modern law-makers, has always
heen treated with obloquy or open oppression by
all shades of the non-producing classes.
The Southern slave-holders ostracised, or
tarred and feathered, or murdered outright, the
man who taught their workmen (slaves) to read;
the aristocracy and gentry of England, some 50
years ago, opposed the education of the slave
classes of the old country, because they knew that
if the slaves were educated ‘ they would all want
to be masters,’ and there would soon ‘be no
workmen.’ The arguments of the non-producing
property holders of that day were in that respect
perfectly sound, for I trust that even now there
are no workmen and no servant girls in the sense
in which they were in England 50 years ago. The
household ‘ slavey’ who tailed 16 hours a day for
her greasy ‘ grub ’ and two shillings a week, has
passed away, is extinct —as extinct and as won-
drous strange as Silurian or Mammoth. The law-
makers and so-called Christian churches of that day
struggled hard to prolong her existence by the
sacrifice of millions of lives in war, and of
thousands of millions of money—the result being
a naked minus quantity—a legacy of foreign hate,
a national debt of a billion sterling (that never
can be paid), and a national flush of red-faced
shame which they still struggle to teach the serf is
‘ Glory.’ Aye, for even yesterday the Christian
bishops of Australia lifted up their voices to the
God of the poor and helpless and blasphemously
asked a blessing on those who went forth to cut
black throats in the Soudan.
* * *
Still the serf of the past is dead—dead as
the press-gang. The sunlight of education has
poured down on the unwholesome mass, and
plants of a fresher growth have within the space
of two score years supplanted it. And still the
destruction is not stayed. The built-up forest of
horrible rules which we call law is day by day
being felled. The loathsome trunks may still
encumber the surface, voracious suckers may still
flourish in some secluded spots, but many a
‘ Forest Devil ’ is at work, and one by one the
ugly-fanged roots are upheaved, rolled into heaps
and burned. Now that the land is being rapidly
stumped and cleared, let us look for the labourers
who are to do this new world’s work. Are they
to be called by any of the old-world names—helot,
serf, slave, thrall, working man ? I venture to
think not —I hope not.
At the risk of being laughed at, I will try and
guess what will happen in this respect in the day
of the near future.
In the field of the workman’s mind,
humanity will probably be divided into two
classes. Firstly, those persons who year by year
produce more wealth than they destroy; secondly,
those who destroy more wealth than they produce.
He will perceive that he has a direct interest
in prolonging the existence of the former class,
and just as direct an interest in the extinction of
the latter.
He will wonder at the absurdity of tolerating
the millionaire, the landlord, the usurer, the
lawyer, the soldier, the expensive ‘lady,’ and the
vast myriads of non-producers, while he allows
the whole rancour of his aversion to be turned
against the comparatively harmless common thief.
For if the thief be imprisoned for any reason,
it must be because he cannot live without de-
stroying the world’s wealth by the amount of food
he eats and the clothes he wears out. This thief
must, if he live and remain a thief, continue
destroying wealth, and he does not create wealth
to replace it. Therefore, he must die—not neces-
sarily the man, but the thief.
Now, if we are interested in the destruction of
the wealth-destroying, non-producing thief, who
perhaps makes the world the poorer by a hundred
pounds worth of bread, beef, wool, &c., every
year, how much more are we interested in the
destruction of the man or woman who destroys
wealth ten times as fast and creates none to re-
place it ?
I worked this question out on a leaf of my
prayer-book amid the expensive fumes of scent-
bottles and the rustle of rich silks in my church-
pew six months ago, and I commend the exercise
to the sages of the Australian Parliaments as ex-
cellent practice.
And now I wonder if it is right, if it is
natural, that there should he any distinct working
class at all.
If we say that a working class must exist,
we cannot escape the question. Out of what
material is it proper it should be formed ?
Let us first decide —Out of what material
should a working class not be formed ?
Of course if any are to he exempt from labour
it must he those who are physically unsuited to it:
The weak, the small, the uncared-for and broken-
down, the badly-nurtured. Of the remainder —
Shall we eliminate those with light hair ?—Unjust
to those with dark hair. Still the question pends :
Where is the material proper to perform the world’s
labour ? In lieu of the old widows of the wash-tub,
worn shapeless with toil, whom shall we place ?
Where are the lusty, over-fed masssive wenches of
the wealthy classes ?—the sixteen-stone duchess —
daughter of a hundred kings, nurtured on port-wine
and seasoned turtle? The men and women to
whom hard toil will be the less hideous —the ‘ well-
bred ’—the well-nourished—the muscular —those
who, in good condition, weigh the heaviest.
Surely this is the class out of which, with the
least evil, the working class must he formed.
But the heart and the reason begin to speak—
While ,fully admitting that it is more honor-
able and just, in fact Christlike, to insist that a
man or woman shall toil because he or she is best
fed and biggest and strongest, rather than because
poor and comparatively starved, still we must
rectify the wrong done to the ponderous progeny
of the blue-blooded classes.
In fact there must be no slave-class—no body
of helots forced to do the whole labour of a world.
All shall work !
There must be no mincing body of patent-
leathered gentry, who ‘ work only with their
brains.’ It requires quite as much ‘ brains ’of the
ordinary sort to become an average carpenter as
it does to become an average anything —doctor,
engineer, lawyer, soldier, architect, sculptor,
musician, statesman, novelist, poet. The mass of
them are mere copyists of the John Stephensons,
the Goethes of the present and past ages, and their
true value is the amount of labour turned into
wealth that may be fairly got out of them over
and above what they consume.
To work, sirs! with axe and mattock, that
others may have the fair share of leisure and rest
of which your unproductiveness assists to rob
them. To work, all of you! Men and women,
perhaps for two or three hours every day, perhaps
for 10 years eight hours per day, and then —free-
dom ! But away with young ladyism and the
* brain work ’ fraud. And shall there be less re-
finement ? Will the gods of our earth do their
work the less well awaiting the verdict of a thou-
sand millions of leisured educated men ? Will the
expression of thought roll less nobly from the soul
of prophet or poet because from childhood he has
been trained to feel shame at his ancestors who
allowed the poor and the weak, the young
children, the aged and the unfortunate, to toil,
while they were rigging themselves out in the
tinsel of unproductive frippery, and seriously
playing at kings and cardinals, taarristerism and
soldierism, as if it were all real and to last, and
never to be wondered at and laughed down ?
Whatever will the C.M.G. man do with his
C.M.G.-ship in that day—the millennium —when
‘ The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and
the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and they shall
not destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the
Lord Rough.”

The Referee
When the Ly-ee-Moon went down, Bishop
Barry preached a special sermon to thousands of
his flock, imploring their charity for the helpless
widows and orphans, and the result was —what ?
—£33. On the settling night of the late A.J.C.
meeting, the Bathurst trainer, Burton, walked
into Tatt.’s, and addressing those fiends in human
form (vide parson Jefferis on gambling), the book-
makers, said: “Gentlemen, Roger Davis, the
jockey, had his arm broken in the last Suburban
Handicap, and as this is his second fall during the
past few weeks, he is down on his luck at pre-
sent.” In one hour’s time nearly £lOO was raised
in that room for the crushed boy.

The great institutions of Australia are at
last beginning to be properly recognised in
England. Even the blase Labouchere was startled
when he received a circular about a Melbourne
“ Cup consultation,” and he rises to ask if 44 James
Walters, secretary, the Club Hotel, King-street,
Newtown, Sydney,” was ever a member of the
firm of Bailee and Walter, who flourished in
London 15 years ago and were mixed up in the
glorious Benson swindle. The effusion, he thinks,
is somewhat in the style of the enterprising
Walter of those days. But then Labouchere is
rather recent in the matter of Australian 44 consul-
tations.” If he knew them a little better, he
would be aware that the style was always the
same, and the results to the investor are much the
same also.

Walter G. George, the English ex-amateur
pedestrian, who is coming to Australia, lately ran
a mile at Lillie Bridge Grounds in the astounding
time of 4min. 12fsec. Hitherto the occasions on
which a mile has been run in 4min. 20sec. have
been few and far between. George was known to
have cut that time by a fraction of a second, and
Cummings, Ms unsuccessful opponent, was ac-
counted to have achieved a phenomenal perform-
ance when he established a record of 4min.
16 l-ssec. George has thus established Ms claim
to be the most wonderful runner at a mile ever
known. It is now cabled that George has beaten
Cummings in a ten-mile race. By the way,
Malone, of Sydney, suggests that a match should
be arranged between himself and Samuels, the
aboriginal, with a view to the winner being pitted
against Hutchens, who will be in Sydney shortly.
Clipped from the London Referee ; —‘ 4 A
Subscriber (Narandera, N.S.W.) : T. Malone did
not run at amateur championship sports 1880. In
1881, in first heat of 100 yards, Cowie was first,
Cleaver second, Malone third, Myers fourth.
Cowie won easily by a yard, the Irishman was
a foot behind Cleaver, and the American about
the same distance in the rear. Myers got badly
away. Course slightly down hill. Time, 10 l-sth
sec. Malone did not run in final, which Phillips
won by a foot from Cowie. In long jump Malone
was second with 22ft. 7in., P. Davin being first
with 22ft. llin. They jumped down hill. At
championship sports, 1882, in second heat of 100
yards, Malone got best of start, and beat Phillips
by two yards, but in final Phillips was first, Cowie
second, and Malone third. Phillips won by six
inches, three yards dividing second and third.
Time, 10 l-sth sec. Malone won long jump with
21ft. Bin. He was considered a fair man over
here, but there were several amateurs who could
heat him. He never showed very great form at
440 yards. Hutchens deposited £lOO to make a
match with anybody, hut Malone did not cover it. ”

The Melbourne Sportsman solemnly warns
Mr. James White against doing as he likes with
his horse Trident. The writer, apparently, has
got his “ bit” on the brother to Navigator, and he
winds up by saying that if the Hon. J. W.
scratches the horse for the Y.R.C. Derby, “he is
a holder and less honourable man than I take him
to he.” It is such skiting as this which provokes
owners to assert their prerogative and snap their
fingers at public opinion. As far as we know,
Mr. White has not yet backed Trident for the
Victorian Derby, and if he can win the race with
a second string, he will certainly be “bold”
enough to scratch the crack, and leave his honour
to take care of itself. Now-a-days, seemingly, a
man who is lucky enough to possess a good
animal is expected to refer to the sporting press
for instructions as to when and where he is to
run it.

If Beach has received a bona fide offer of
£2OOO to go to America and row Hanlan, why does
“Our William” hold off I His seeming high-
headedness may probably be explained away by
the mistake of an 0 in Reuter’s telegram. £2OO,
we guess, is the price which Hanlan is prepared
to give or take, and it is certainly as much as he
will get the chance of taking. The Canadian may
find it hard to accept Ms present position in the
aquatic scale, but we can scarcely credit him
with possessing the sublime impudence to ask
£2900 for the pleasure of coming over to Australia,
Until the ex-champion has re-asserted his claim to
he considered a power on the water, there would
be very little money in a match between him and
Beach, on the Parramatta or anywhere else.
Bearing this in mind we can only think that
Hanlan is bluffing with his recent offers and chal-
lenges. Granting that Beach kept him fooling
about in Australia, that is no reason why he can
keep our man fooling about on the other side.
Hanlan stayed here in the hope of winning back
his reputation. Beach holds his reputation, and
is able to please himself, and after giving every-
body a fair chance for the last four or five months
the all-conquering William can afford to ignore
Hanlan’s tardy vapourings without laying himself
open to the charge of funk.

The defeat of the Australians by Kent
was not so inexplicable after all. Kent appears
to have worked quite into the front rank of Eng-
lish counties, and boasts, in the four Hearnes, a
cricketing family worthy to be classed with the
renowned Graces or Walkers. The bowling of
Alec, and the batting of G. G. Hearne (also a first- '
class bowler) have been very successful during
the past season. Within a fortnight G. G. Hearne
scored 63 (not out) against Australia, 117 against
Yorkshire, and 53 and 126 against Middlesex,
making an average of 116 for three innings in first-
class company. In the latter match another of
the brothers, Frank Hearne, scored 47 and 142.
These are quite as good as the best achievements
of the Graces in their best days, and the chances
are that when the Australian Eleven meets an
All-England team it will be found to include
three members of the Hearne family. It is a pity
that none of them are coming out with Shaw’s
crowd, which (with the exceptions of Lohmann
and Maurice Read) will be composed of North of
England players.
* * *
The most extraordinary feature about the
Beach-Wallace Ross match was the fact that it
ever came off. Let’s see. Matterson heat Ross,
Teemer heat Matterson, Beach beat Teemer. On
paper, Beach had such an uncommonly soft thing
that we are almost inclined to doubt the genuine-
ness of the match. None of the English scullers
can find “monkeys” to give away in this reckless
fashion. They never open negotiations with a
man of any calibre, now-a-days, without first
stipulating for a few seconds’ start. If Wallace
Ross really was backed, and with British gold, it
might just as well have been laid out on Perkins
or Bubear, for the sake of auld lang syne.
* * *
As soon as Billy Farnan gets about again
we may be having another merry mill ’twixt Mm
and Jackson. Then, if Farnan succeeds in again
taking down the darkie’s number, we shall see
Lees wresting the championship from Ms old
opponent, and losing it once more to Jackson—and
so on. This is what may happen. But, judging
from what we saw on Saturday week, it will be
good odds against Farnan if he ever gets into the
ring with Jackson again.

12,938 runs for the loss of 621 wickets,
were scored by the English teams against the Aus-
tralians during the recent cricketing season. The
Australians scored 12,043 runs for the loss of 631
wickets.
MELBOURNE SPORTING ITEMS.
(From Our Own Correspondent.)
At Melbourne Hunt Club meeting, the
amateur jockeys only reserved one race for them-
selves. The form they showed in that event fully
justified their modesty.
The Tasmanian horse, Duke of Athol, en-
gaged for Caulfield, ran In the mile and looked
well enough, but was evidently very sore and was
hopelessly beaten at a furlong. Six furlongs
seems to be the length of Ms tether. * I vote
against him for both Cups.
For the mile, Kohai and Levite were said
to he heavily backed. Neither got a place, but
perhaps neither showed true form. Anyhow, I
don’t think Levite has the remotest show for
Caulfield. lam more careful about Kohai. The
stable perhaps has really something good in
Mozart, who, I should say, holds Kohai safe over
any distance.
Gardenia, the Caulfield pet, piloted by
O’Brien, sailed along evidently satisfied with her
position at the finish, but perhaps ere Caulfield
ends she may he nearer the front.
Giovanni ran well for six furlongs, hut re-
quires more time. As for Islander it puzzles one
how he escaped notice. At three furlongs he was
20 lengths behind everything ; the calm style in
which he cantered after his field was delicious
and utterly out of keeping with his splendid track
form. Keep your eye on Islander.
The S.A. party, who were cocksure, were terri-
bly disappointed at the defeat by Mistletoe (King-
ston stable) of their Maribyrnong candidate,
Hortense, who ran second ; Harridan, from same
stable, was third. The three are engaged for
Maribyrnong Plate, as also are Patience, Lieder-
tafel, Glentworth, Albert Lodden, St. Michael,
Teuton, and Lady Lovel, who also started. To
win they must improve considerably. Mr. Pear-
son’s withdrawal of Bedouin in favour of his
second string, Citadel, disappointed many who
look upon him as one of the few Victorians likely
to keep the prize from Sydney.
At Flemington there is uneasiness at the queer
form shown by Quentin Matsys in his work. Mr.
Dakin ascribes it to muscle-soreness; some
amongst us here think Quentin good for Caulfield,
hut I don’t dream of him. If the distance were a
mile the big chestnut might be dangerous with his
weight. The extra four furlongs will stop him.
The much-cracked-up Remus has gone wrong
while doing good work and thriving on it. He
has been eased off. This is bad luck for Cook,
whose chances were brilliant.
Eagle Grange is progressing nicely under Abe
Davis ; although perhaps not up to Cup form he
may shine in small events.
The frolicsome Leshia’s stable are, I hear, some-
what confident of victor? at Caulfield if the mare
be well, but I vote against her.
The above, with Dunlop, St. John, Levite, First
Consul, King’s Son, Islander, and Don Giovanni

Flemington for Caulfield Cup. Barring St. John

ning.
Caulfield Foal Stakes looks a moral for Yetman
should he come from Sydney. Victoria’s only
hope is the speedy Epicurean. As I write I don’t
know if Tabard will see the post. I hope he does,

The Guineas is more open. I am hopeful of
Maddelina, but I am afraid Victoria’s chance of
getting the stake is “ Buckley’s show.”
The Melbourne scribes, especially “ Augur,”
still harp and snarl over Ringmaster’s scratching

that if hackers choose to handle fire they must

religiously away.
THE CAULFIELD RACE MEETING.
(From our Occasional Correspondent.)
[BY WIRK.)
Melbourne, Tuesday.
In forwarding you my anticipations so far ahead
of the opening of the meeting, I am placed at a
great disadvantage. However, the following
may he near the actual results :
Maiden Plate, one mile —Menotti, Lord of the
Manor, Buckley.
Hurdle Race, two miles—Dunrobin, Distiller,
Ocean.
Great Foal Stakes, half-a-mile —Epicurean, Yet-
man, Lava.
Caulfield Guineas, one mile —Maddelina, Vol-
cano, Acme.
Toorak Handicap, one mile—Hogmanay,
Maroney, Richworth.
Billy Hoskins!
Poor old Billy Hoskins is dead. And nlany and
many an old fellow looks in the glass and shrugs
his shoulders and thinks it is time to put off the
old Adam and get ready for the next world.
Billy’s official record puts him at 71, but people
who had listened to him yarning about old days
would judge him to be at least 100. He was a
shining light on the stage in London twenty years
before New South Wales obtained the privilege of
responsible Government, and before that he had
made a name in the provinces. Then before he
faced the footlights at all he had passed through
Cambridge, though without carrying much away,
perhaps, and had been called to the bar. The old
man was full of memories, and lived a big life till
the very last. He was nearly a generation older
than George Coppin and Harwood and Grevillc
He came out in the first flush of the gold time,
and played away through all the Vic'oriau
theatres from the earliest pavilion on Bendigo to
the last new Royal in Melbourne. Billy was very
much a marrying man. One of his most brilliant
efforts in this way was his espousal of Miss
Florence Colville In Christchurch, New Zealand.
With Colville he starred his way from the Bluff
right North, giving the rustics of the little provin-
cial towns their first taste of genuine comedy. At
Christchurch he arrived at the conclusion that it
was not good for man to be alone, and so Miss
Florence Colville became Mrs. William Hoskins.
And what a day there was in Christchurch at that
illustrious wedding ! The chief person in the
Cathedral city of Maoriland at that time was Sir
Cracroft Wilson, otherwise “ The Nabob.” The
Nabob had a place at Cashmere, filled with his
share of the loot of many an Indian city, where he
lived in a sort of oriental splendour with
servants innumerable, and, as guests, all visi-
tors to the city who had seen the world and
could talk about it. Billy was there, of
course, aud from Cashmere was married. The old
Nabob, straight as a pine, brown as a hazel-nut, and
with a moustache lying like a wisp of snow
across his face, drove his four greys up to town,
and the Bishop, in lawn sleeves, met them at
the door, and Flo. Colville looked innocent
as an angel and pretty as an hour! ; and many
people of the town got drunk that night. What a
day of pomp it was ! How the horses pranced
how the drums heat and the bells rang, and old
Billy stalked dignified through it all, as his name-
sake the Kaiser through a court function ! But
things changed, alas ! Billy came to Sydney ten
years after, and the Christchurch bride was not.
There was another wedding, for the old
cavalier hated to he single, and somehow fine
women seemed to think more of him on the verge
of three-score-and-ten than of most young fellows
of flve-and-twenty. He gave himself away again,
this time to a sweet creature of 17, and went
down to Melbourne, and there Bishop Moorhouse
gave Mm a commission to teach his clergy to read
the church lessons and their sermons. Yes, Billy
held a class of divines, and his lordship did not
disdain at times to he amongst them. It was
about Ms last good work—Ms later attempts at
play were melancholy to those who remembered
him in the digging days. Hamlet’s father’s Ghost
was about the only character left that would fit
him. As the Ghost at times he stalked with dig
nity. Poor old fellow, he will be haunting many
a stage now, and many a memory. And by all
who knew him well the memory of Mm will
always be courteously entertained, for all the
record of his life was good and bright. Fifty
years on the boards, fifty years in the blaze of a
footlight, a competent actor from first to last, and
always and in all things a gentleman.

More tales about colonists on the “bust.”
One of them, who was at a party at Eaton Hall,
went up to his Grace of Westminster and ex-
claimed with a smile, “ Glad to make your
acquaintance, Duke.” Then he shook hands with
the aristocrat who looked at him as if he had
pawned his bones and lost the ticket, begged a
photograph from his album, got the ducal auto-
graph on the back, told the duke he would look
in again when passing, and strolled away.
Says the Sydney Echo, in a leader
“ The eight-hour privilege is an indirect cash con-
tribution levied upon the working-man ; he has to
pay it in the shape of increased rent, and a per-
ceptible increase in the price of |comraodities. Is
the financial position of the Australian mechanic
any better than that of the English artisan?
That is a problem which is well worth working
out.” The Australian workman should paste this
extract in his hat. Was ever so monstrous a
question asked since the world began ?
When we saw in the Sydney Evening
News on Eight-Hours’ Day an ode by “ One of
the Employed” ; (signed “ J. Cook”) beginning
with “ Arise ! thou glorious orb ” and winding
up with
“ Then all the world shall know in stem reality,
Australia is the labourer's land of liberty,”
we at once knew it was in every sense of the word
strictly original. But the excellent verses “By
One of the Unemployed,” printed directly above
the aforesaid ode, and purporting to have been
brewed expressly for the occasion, were not
original. The News, which is eternally prating
about “ the encouragement of Australian litera-
ture,” deceived few decent people by its impudent
attempt to palm off as its own a well-known set of
verses which first appeared eight or ten years ago
over the signature of Mr. Garnet Walch, of
Melbourne.
The eight-hours’ demonstration in Sydney
last Monday was the greatest event of the kind
ever known in N.S.W. Twenty-two trade
societies were represented, and they mustered a
total of 10,000 men—an army of which the colony
has every reason to be proud. But somehow the
Conservative Press, even at this late hour, seems
to retain a grudge against the emancipation of
the working classes, and though the ultra-respec-
table S.M. Herald raises no protest it shoves the
little Echo in front to cast a stone at the move-
ment. Among the columns of laudanum printed
on brass which make up that journal, we actually
read that it is this same eight hours’ system which
raises rents and does other sinful things tending
to make life a burden to the poor. We always
thought that rents went highest in localities where
jobbers had run land up to £ 00 a foot or so, and
ascribed the extortions practised to monopolies
and swindles, hut the Echo seems to know better
—it is all owing to the fact that a stiff-necked and
brutal race won’t work 16 hours a day.

“lolanthe” at Sydney Royal is as gay
and as utterly absurd as ever. Everything is
mixed and confused, and the madman who
endeavours at the commencement to wrestle with
latitude and longitude is laid prostrate in one act,
and falls down in a quivering heap with a gsogra-
phical nightmare sitting on his chest. The scene
appears to be laid in England, if it is fair to judge
from the stolid Tommy Atkins who is upheaved
in the last act, the comic Chancellor, who, like all
British Chancellors, flings his robes on his head
and dances in Palace Yard, Westminster, and the
assemblage of peers—the wildest lot of crowned
guys who ever blocked a Deceased Wife’s Sister
Bill in the Upper House; but mixed with these is a
shepherd who hardly answers to the heavy mud-
footed, clay-pipe-smoking English animal, and
who says he comes from Arcadia, and a shepherd-
ess belonging to the same locality. Strephon, too,
is obviously a man of peace, and yet in the land
where Arcadia used to be the agriculturist goes
armed like a brigand, and everybody is haunted
by an uneasy consciousness that Eyoub Pasha is
somewhere beyond the distant hills, and that his
Syrians and Bashi-Bazouks are keeping an eagle
eye on things in general. Under these circum-
stances there is no resource but to throw geography
and anatomy to the winds and go in for unscien-
tific enjoyment, and the nightly crowd at the
Royal do this in real earnest.

Miss Alice Barnett, we learn, has renewed
her engagement with the company for another 12
months, so her billet as the Fairy Queen may be
regarded as permanent. She is a tall and power-
ful Queen, capable of throwing a fairy or an insur-
ance-agent at least two miles, but she looks a
sovereign every inch—there are a good many inches
altogether—and her singing is good throughout.
Mr. Howard Vernon, as the Lord Chancellor, is
doubled up with his weight of nisi prius lore ;
his song regarding nightmares and dreams is
about the best in the opera, and the chief objec-
tion to be made in his case is that he is much
too “spry” and a little too grotesque for his
part. Miss Ida Osborne is reported to have
been standing on her head at the bottom of a
froggy stream for 25 years, but she makes a
charming lolanthe; and, as regards the other
characters, they might have been considerably
worse. This remark applies—among others —to
Mr. Brennir, who, in the part of Strephon, ap-
pears to be oppressed by the recollection of his
decaying extremities and his immortal upper half.
Even in his duets with Phyllis, when he might
reasonably be expected to be joyful, his legs seem
to be weighing on his brain, or, more probably, he
is thinking of the unspeakable Turk who hangs
like a cloud over his native Arcadia, and thus the
Moslem casts a dark shadow upon the opera which
we would like to see effaced.

There is the Devil to pay at Sydney Royal
Standard, that individual being the centre figure
in “Faust,” and large audiences assemble nightly
to see their old friend. Mr. Dampier’s Mephis-
topheles is a sardonic, dancing fiend, dressed in
lurid crimson, who blows his sheolic nose on a red
handkerchief ; he appears generally to travel in
bad weather, and he heralds his arrival by bang-
ing a gridiron against a stump, which row is
passed off as thunder. He has a hook
nose and a black moustache, and when he grins
that wild, pernicious grin of his, his nose comes
down to his jaw and his moustache goes up to his
eyes ; he has a laugh like a shriek from the front
end of a half-cremated live hyena ; and he has a
reprehensible way of inviting a sinner to “ come
down with him —down —down —down,” and then
he grabs the victim by the neck and they both
descend into that eternal place whereof there
never was any bottom.
* * *
In the very first act he buys up Faust’s
soul on a short and very hot bill, payable in
blazes, and restores that patriarch’s youth by way
pf “ value received,” but even at this early period
h is plain that Faust has been bought cheap. To a
Pure and simple-minded person, too, it is shocking
to see how the sulphurous goblin trots after his
Purchase when the latter is going in search of his
best girl, and screeches that he will have the lady
utso, and then he adds, with a terrible whoop, that
they are all going down together—“ down, down,
down”— to a land where even Fahrenheit would
burst, and where a man is only released from his
stove for a second in each 10,000 years that he may
tell his underdone neighbour how darned hot it is
getting. But even Mephistopheles has his weak
Points. When Faust follows Marguerite into a
ohurch the demon remains outside and prophesies
sudden death to a crowd of drunken students, but
be is seized with abject terror at the sight of a
cr pss, and the sound of a church bell smites him
agony. In the third act Faust s suit with
Marguerite it prospering ; his ill-omened shadow
uiakes love the while to a Gamp-like female, who
puts as the lady’s guardian, but when the fat nurse
featherbeds herself against him with her arms
r °und his neck, and asks if he has never thought
°f settling down with a wife and a home of his
he is forced to fly. Dame Martha even plans
*h elope to perdition, and expects the fiend to hump
her luggage wrapped in a sheet, but the scheme mis-
purries. From this point all is gloom. Marguerite’s
brother is killed; her mother dies poisoned,
and the broken-hearted girl is imprisoned on a
charge of murder. Faust, in despair, drags his
embodied curse with him to the gaol and demands
his assistance to free his sweetheart, but the
weather is bad and the hoarse and coughing devil
is in a disagreeable temper and blows his sardonic
nose gloomily. Ultimately Marguerite is released
but only to die in her lover’s arms; Mephisto-
pheles watches her last agonies with an appalling
grin on his rat-trap jaw and calls on her to come
down with him, but she escapes ; and then he
rushes vengefully at Faust, the earth gapes
asunder, and the pair go down amid a yell of
horror and a rush of flame and smoke. We
noticed with regret, however, that the bottomless
pit was covered only by a cracked board, and we
would urge the management to look after this. It
would be awkward if some of the fiends were to
break out and rush the stalls.
* * *
Mr. Dampier was one of the best devils
we have ever seen ; we would advise him to stick
to this line of business, and start a sheol of his
own in Wolloomooloo. Mr. Baker as Faustus the
philosopher, and Mr. Boothman as Faust the
gallant, were good, the latter especially; Miss
Dampier was only a moderately attractive Mar-
guerite, and in comparison with the splendid
demon who haunted her steps she looked but
second rate. Mr. Leston made Slebel a wildly
comic object fit only to be covered with treacle
and set out to catch flies; Mr. E. Holloway as
Valentine was a walking curse, or rather a walk-
ing object too fond of cursing ; and Miss Julia
Merton gave satisfaction as the nurse. The rest
of the company were mostly drunk as the exi-
gencies of the tragedy required, and gave good
promise of waking with quite a number of heads
on them in the morning.

Sydney Academy is now occupied by the
Rickards-Leete combination—a versatile crowd
who seem to be more different people rolled into
one than any other people that we ever saw rolled
into anything. In “ Spoons,” for example, Mr.
Harry Rickards is announced as appearing in the
eightfold capacity of Jack Marlingspike, Joe Jug-
gins (a horsey, doggy individual), C. G. Fitzbattle-
axe P. Brown, Podophyllyn Plum, Deep-sinking
Dick, Captain Baker, Apollo Jones (who is said to
be a goat), and Simpson Breezes—though as the last
individual is described as being “ far away,” it
might be supposed that he would appear in that
character best by not appearing at all. The re-
maining seven members of the company divide
15 parts among them, making a good all-round
average of three apiece. Leaning up against the
door-post, enveloped in a hideous blizzard, with a
man in a tall hat blocking the way in front and a
man with a bad cold alongside, we tried to take a
comprehensive view of “ Spoons ” —and failed.
We know no more about it now than when wo
commenced. The incidents tread fast on each
other’s heels, like Genesis chasing Revelations, or
Isaiah Cohen doing an intellectual steeplechase in
pursuit of Charles Dickens; there are a rich
brother and a will, a detective, a very cheap
horse, some hot coffee, and a number of songs
which seem to take well with a mixed audience ;
there is a burglarious visitor who climbs into
somebody’s house—or at least he climbs into the
programme, which is circumstantial evidence of
the fact, and there is a wild, weird mixture of
everything with nothing on top. “ Spoons,” as wo
learn, was written expressly for Mr. Harry
Rickards, but if anyone had written a thing like
it for us and requested us to play eight characters,
each worse than the other, and the whole let
combined worse than the worst individual mem-
ber of the gang, we would have had his brains on
a battleaxe. The acting was pretty good through-
out —at least the daily papers say so.
MISS ESSIE JENYNS.
As “JULIET.”
In the new and improved edition of
Shakespeare, which is shortly to come before the
public, it is Romeo, not Macbeth, who murdered
sleep, and at Sydney Opera House he not only
perpetrates this act of slaughter nightly, but he
drags the ensuing corpse nine times round the
stage. There is, however, a marked improvement
on previous performances—he used to drag the
mangled remains 18 times, and even then he
looked as if he hungered for another canter. Miss
Essie Jenyns, at Juliet, is, as before, the life and
soul of the piece ; she is as beautiful and as suc-
cessful as ever, and half the male audience are
longing to throw Romeo into the middle of North
Queensland and take his place under the balcony.
Miss Jenyns is an actress of whom Australia has
good reason to be proud ; she is a native of the
land, having been born in Brisbane—date pot
stated, but it was certainly recent, and is the
daughter of the late Dr. Jenyns, of that city,
and step-daughter to Mr. W. J. Holloway.
Her first appearance was at Hobart, where she
played the page in “ Richelieu ” with Mr. Cres-
wick as the wily, far-reaching Cardinal ; she next
performed in Adelaide along with George Rignold,
who was starring in “ Henry Y.,” and since then
she has steadily advanced in popularity. In 1881
she proceeded along with Mr. Holloway to Europe
and studied for a short period in Paree, and on her
return she commenced playing a series of Shakes-
perian characters with great success. During the
present season she will enact the roles of Imogen,
j Beatrice, Rosalind, and Ophelia, and if her ren-
dering of Juliet is to be taken as a criterion she
will become more than ever a popular favourite
in Sydney.

The Fisk Jubilee Singers have commenced
a campaign at the Y.M.C.A. Hall, Sydney, and
are drawing very good houses. This combination
is rather an old one, and in the time of the original
Jubilee Fisk they were bent on charitable objects
alone; since then, however, they have turned
away after the mammon of unrighteousness, and
with very encouraging results. Their repertoire
covers everything from the Lord’s Prayer down to
“It’s never too co-ho-o-old to be baptised,” and
by this judicious mixture they come as near to
pleasing everybody as a Jubilee African could well
expect. Pathos and comedy are mingled together
all tinough; “Didn’t the Lord deliver Daniel”
merges suddenly into asoulful wail “and Jo-honah
from the interior of the Wha-a-ale,” and that
whale fetches the audience every time.

At a recent amateur dramatic performance
in aid of the building fund of a N.S.W. country
church, an incident happened which has caused
much scandal in a quiet community. The piece
was of the “ East Lynne ” style, one of the local
aldermen taking the part of the gay deceiver,
while the only daughter of the baker assumed the
role of the frail and ultimately dishonored and
deserted wife. The first two acts wont very well,
the drop-scene at the conclusion of each falling
amidst thunders of applause. The scene had been
down for hardly two minutes the second time
when it went up again with a run, and a sight
which made some of the leading residents turn
crimson with shame met the gaze of the audience.
In the middle of the stage was a table covered
with bottles and glasses, and seated round wore
the various artistes, male and female, discussing
long beers and sandwiches. The startled per-
formers were greeted with along, unearthly howl,
and tore off the stage in anything but a dignified
manner. The prompter, who was an absent-
minded man, was the cause of the trouble ; he
thought when he saw the assemblage gormandis-
ing that the 3rd act was to open with a land-sale
picnic and accordingly ran the curtain up. The
upshot of the whole affair was that the church
refused to accept the proceeds of the performance,
the parson preached a sermon on the “ Immorality
of the f-tage,” the baker’s daughter was tabooed
out of “society,” the alderman had to resign his
seat in the Council, and the prompter got 24 hours’
notice to leave the town.

The Lynch Family are still pounding along

The new Polytechnic in George-street,
Sydney, has lately been opened by that old wielder
of the birch and quill, Mr- Alfred Cane, who for
so [many years performed the frightful task of
answering all the questions asked by readers of

the “ Children’s Column.” No man could be better
fitted for the task he has undertaken than Mr
Cane, to whom we wish every success. We hope
he hasn't left the D. & G. on account of any absurd
idea that the “Peeress’”letters make our little con-
temporary too breezy for a domestic circulation.

Since the Japanese Village was built in
Melbourne, all sorts of sensations have disturbed
the calm current of its rural life. The young lady
who was fired into the loving grasp of her sweet-
heart out of an 81-ton gun is replaced by a young
gentleman who may be graphically described as a
regular cough-drop. Mr. Ala,- the sensation in
question, is shot up 20 yards into the air, catches
hold of a trapeze, and dives headforemost into a
net 20 yards below. A clever twist at the last
moment enables Mr. Ala to drop comfortably on
his back instead of breaking his neck. The
“ serial flight” is of the kind which immortalised
Lulu some 17 or 18 years ago, and is accomplished
we believe, by the aid of the very same machine
with which that spurious fair ‘one fraudulently
vaulted into many masculine affections. There is
no deception, gentlemen, about this performance,
and it is, in point of blood-curdling merit, superior
to anything done by the much-talked-of George
Conquest The exciting possibility of something
going wrong is attracting good business to the
Village. It isn’t that the public want an accident,
doncherknow, but they take a pleasure in satisfy,
ing themselves that one hasn’t occurred. As for
the Japs., they have never enjoyed village life so

The Alexandra Theatre, Melbourne, went
off with a tremendous bang on Friday last. From
a sassiety point of view the opening performance
was an undoubted success. Inside were assem-
bled rank, fashion, and a glittering crowd of dead-
heads —outside gathered an admiring multitude of
the great unwashed. By 8 o’clock the excitement
was tremendous. An approving murmur from
the mob in the street announced the arrival of
George Rignold and Miss Kate Bishop. A mighty
yell greeted His Excellency the Governor and
party. Anon another murmur, followed by a
popular demonstration from the pit, told us that
the Broughs and Boucicaults were taking their
seats in the orchestra stalls. Then somebody
spotted The Bulletin representative, and a cold
shudder went right through the house. The next
quarter of an hour flitted pleasantly away in up-
roars and speeches. Mr. Jules Joubert came before
the gorgeous plush curtain and orated something
about ladies getting home rule, and the sun never
setting on the British Empire. The tear was still
standing in our eye .when Mr. Joubert led to the
footlights Miss Julia Sydney, the manageress.
Mies Sydney proved to be a handsome
lady, handsomely attired, whose neat little
speech was marred by evident nervousness, and
the unmistakable restlessness of the hack seats.
This disaffection was caused by people standing in
the centre gangways. One London “copper”
would have put the matter right in about a
minute. A small detachment of Victorian police
miserably failed to grapple with the difficulty, and
it speaks well for the temper of a colonial audience
that the show was allowed to proceed. Possibly
the pittites who couldn’t see were consoled by the
knowledge that they weren’t missing much.
Truth to toll, “ Bad Lads ” was not a very dainty
dish to set before such a right royal audience.
When Mr. Walter Craven wrote down “ Bad
Lads ” as “ a new and original farcical comedy ”
we hope he blushed. The characters and plot
have been filched from “ Forbidden Fruit ” and
“ The Magistrate,” robbed of their humour, and
subjected to all sorts of indignities. The strongest
of companies would fail to get much fun out of
such a farrago of tomfoolery as “ Bad Lads,” and
the Alexandra Company is inclined to ho
not strong—a little delicate, in fact—in
its constitution. A Miss Eliza Clairborne
as a confiding young wife looked suitably simple
and pretty. Mr. Robert Inman kept himself at
ease under very trying oircumsfances; and Mr.
George Leopold obtained a few laughs at the ex-
pense of many grimaces. Of the others it is suffi-
cient to say that Miss Zaidee de Rot he (billed as
from the Avenue and Royalty Theatres, London)
gives us an impression that she must have filled
one line parts in the great metropolis. “ Bad
Lads ” played for a full three hours on the open-
ing night—just one hour too long. Cutting down
might do a little for the piece, but not much. It
requires to be born again. The title is a misno-
mer. Mr. Craven’s comedy should be re-chris-
tened “ Bad Egg ’’ and chucked away as soon as
possible. The management has a nice new house,
distinguished by many novel and pleasing features.
But it is not a luxuriously-appointed house, and
will look uncommonly bare if the programme isn’t
speedily changed.

American engagements. Evidently she will, for
the New York Mirror says : “ Lord Lonsdale
comes over to pilot as well as pay for the Cameron
folks, and Lord Londesborough is expressing much
anxiety lest the similarity of their names get him
mixed with the management.” There is some-
thing peculiarly rich about Londesborough’s
anxiety. He has devoted the whole of his
life to “ running ” pretty actresses in the same
way and on the same terms as the other fellow.
Some of the little gems which Londesborough
selected in the rough were polished, at vast ex-
pense, into clever performers. Emily Fowler and

fession after “ breaking off” with the nobleman

William Stedmau, of Sydney, has had a
narrow escape from enrolment in the noble army
of martyrs. He is possessed of a short temper
and a father-in-law, and the other day he received
a telegram regarding the latter which made the
former boil over. The message stated that the
relative in question had kicked his ancient bucket,
and called on William to come and bury him—
a prospective expense which seems to have made
him feel nasty, but he felt still worse when he
found the alleged corpse-in-law smoking his pipe,
and seemingly good for another 20 years of exis-
tence. Then he told the mouldering object that
he had come to bury him, and that he meant to
do it before he went away, and finally growing
frantic he seems to have asked tho smoking de-
ceased why the blazes he was alive, and why ho
hadn’t been born dead in the first place, and thus
saved all the bother. Upon this the remains of
the old man began to grow vicious, and he said
that he wasn’t going to become a damp unplea-
sant body merely to satisfy his son-in-law’s insane
thirst for corpses, and Anally the agile dead rushed
away to get a summons against the man who was
so intensely anxious to inter his bones. The
magistrate, however, dismissed the case, but the
signs are that when the old man really passes
away he will require to bury himself, for his son-
in-law is hardly likely to make the attempt again.

Editor Bulletin.— Sir, —The Australian
public has always a good word for the liberal man.
It gave a little to Von Bieren, the fraudulent
insolvent, as he stood in the dock the other day,
because it knew that he had not all through his
I colonial career been utterly selfish. It did not quite
harden its heart against absconder Holt as it might
| have done, because it was aware that when he
| was affluent he had done many and many a
| generous action ; and even when Adolphe Bechet,
the convicted arsonist, was led disgraced from the
dock, there were good and honest and influential
men who, because they knew that the unhappy
prisoner’s life had not been one of self-seeking
only, were not ashamed to hold out their hands to
him ere he was taken to the felon’s cell, and wish
him all the luck that could befall a man whose
folly had doomed him to herd with criminals for
seven long and awful years. But the liberal men
of the community are not those who most loudly
advertise their own generosity. There is one
tolerably vulgar man who gives huge semi-
public entertainments, which are designed
to bo magnificent and are attended by scores
who only go to stoke themselves with his
liquor and his viands. He thinks he has contrived
to build up for himself a reputation for open-
hearted generosity and lavishness, whereas there
arc hundreds in this community who now know
that while his champagne was flowing down the
throats of the mob whose applause he thought to
buy, his bailiff was selling up the furniture of an
old penniless widow tenant of his, who had got
back in her rent. The wino of such a man is bitter
to the mouth. —Yours truly, Christian Socialist.

Mayor Young’s invitation to the “ Austra-
lian Jubilee Municipal Meeting,” at Sydney, did
not excite much interest in Perth (W.A.) The
councillors merely read his letter, instructed the
Town Clerk to acknowledge same, and passed on
to gas, without even expressing their pleasure
at Jubilee Y.’s condescension. Most of them are
M.L.O.’s, and they look down on an ordinary one-
horse mayor with supreme contempt, and estimate
him about as highly as a Salvation captain. They
might, perhaps, come on the invitation of a
governox', but even then they would require a
guard of honour, and a gorgeous fossil to walk in
front with a drum, and clear the way,
Apropos of the Moran- Vaughan burial
imbroglio, we read that “ all that the wealthiest
Roman Catholics do for sons and daughters who
‘go into religion ’ is to provide them with a very
moderate annuity—seldom more than £6O or £lOO
a year —the principal of which returns to the
family on the death of the annuitant. When the
heir to an estate becomes a priest or a monk, he
usually waives his claims in favour of his next-of-
kin, taking only enough for his actual support.
Of the eight sons of the late Colonel Vaughan, of
Courtfleld, Herefoi’dshire, six entered the R.C.
Church. But Courtfleld did not pass into the
hands of the Bishop of Salford, who was the
eldest son, nor into those of the late Archbishop of
Sydney, or of Father Kenelm Vaughan, or of the
redoubtable Prior of Fort Augustus, but to Major
Vaughan, the fifth son.”
It seems that Violet Cameron, heroine of
the recent Lonsdale scandal, made one of those
marriages for which fascinating opera houffeisls
are famous. Violet was taken in. She thought
she had a real catch in Monsieur David de Ben-
saude, but as a matter of fact, David has never
contributed anything towards the housekeeping
expenses since the day when they were made one.
As a lover he hired private boxes and flung
bouquets to her, so Violet —little noodle—took
him on trust as a millionaire Frenchman without
a single misgiving. Others, like her, do the same.
They are so “tricky,” so cute, so versed in the
world’s ways (stage world), and above all, can
X’eckon men up so well, that they refuse fifty good
offers and waltz off with some transparent fraud,
whose only possessions are his debts. And when
they find how dear their folly has cost, they take
it out in giddiness.
Now-a-clays you sec Henniker Heaton s
name in every London paper, from the Times down
to Town Talk. The very latest abouthim comes by
wire : he has offered to construct another Anglo-
Australian cable in consideration of a Government
subsidy of £360,000. The London Echo (which
brought about the reduction of inland newspaper
postage to a halfpenny) says ;—“We wish Mr.
Heaton every success in his endeavours to obtain a
universal international penny postage. In procuring
an offer from agreat Australian steamship company
to take letters direct by sea to Australia for one
penny each, he has given such a wound to six-
penny postage between Great Britain and Aus-
tralia as it cannot i - ecover. From henceforward
all persons having correspondence with Austra-
lasia will know that sd. out of each 6d. postage
they are obliged to pay is due to the action of the
Boat Office, who have placed themselves in such a
position that they are obliged to pay to the pre-
sent contractors 500 per cent, more than they
could get the mails carried for at somewhat less
speed by a powerful steamship company. As a few
days’ difference in the length of time taken by a
letter to or from Australia is of little importance to
most persons, especially the poorer classes of emi-
grants and others, it would be an immense boon
to them if Mr. Heaton’s suggestion could be car-
ried out. At present- 6d., in thousands of cases,
is almost a prohibitive rate.” So that, you see,
Henniker is not merely on the road to fame. He
has already got there.

The Victorian “ army ” is to be raised

The South Australian land revenue for the
years 1885-6 only fell £65,000 below the Treasurer’s
estimate. He must surely be related to the Hon.
G. R. Dibbs. He calculated that £192,000 would
be realised from this source, but the total only
amounted to £127,000. £195,000 is the estimated

Sir Graham Berry writes to the Victorian

Mr. Gladstone, in a very recent letter to

The Bundaberg Chamber of Commerce,
headed in this matter by Mr. D. F. Johnson, is
effectively agitating for the erection in Queensland
of State Metallurgical Works for the reduction of

of much attention in all newspapers, considering
how largely our progress is dependent upon the
development of mineral resources.
Colonel Hope declares it to be a fact that
to-day “there is not afloat in the British Navy
one single heavy breech-loading gun that the
captain of the ship has not heen ordered not to

the British swords are as unserviceable as the
breech-loaders with which England’s ironclads are
decorated.
Thus speaks Mr. George Coppin, touching
his recent Yurrupean experiences : “ As to Imperial
Federation, when it is talked about, most practical
minds ask what it means, and they find no ex-

don’t trouble at all about it. “Imperial Federa-

sixpenny pamphlet. Its aims are —More colonial
billets for British Tories.
The Imperial Parliament had not been
sitting more than a very few moments
when the Tory cat was let out of the
Tory bag. Ireland is to be governed by
the sword. Sir Redvors Duller has been sent to

“Atticus” makes a suggestion in the

eternal fitness of things it would then require

Here we are (says 'Vanity Fair) at as
critical a period in the history of the country as it
has ever known, and we are practically without
an army on which the country can depend in the

the “ voice of the people ” has come to at last

So the Sydney D.T. has taken another
curve! It now tacitly advocates the abolition o'
the lash, for in a strong two-column contributed
{and doubtless paid for) articleby “ F.M.,”itallows
that well-knownprofessionalwritertosay: “I know
it would serve no good purpose to flog them (the
Mount Rennie offenders) or to flog anybody ; and
any man who will give a little thoughtful study to
the history of the lash in this colony will share
that most profound conviction.” Rut when the
lash is abolished and that must come soon—the
Australian people should not forget that Th k
Bulletin was the one paper which for years and
lars stood alone in advocating the abolition of a

Advance Australia ! Wo’vo trounced the
hole world on water, and wo are now in a fair

as follows :—United States of America, £1 13s
. ; England, £3 7s. lOd. ; Now South Wales,
13s. (id. ; and Victoria, £4 Ids. lid. It’s a bit
ajar on N.S.VV. vanity to find the Cabbage
irdon ahead, but still the Cornstalks have the
prome satisfaction of knowing that, young and
1 as their colony is, it spends throe times as
uch per head for lire-water as the United States,
d nearly one-third more than “drunken
igland.” One million of people spend £4,870,971
year on grog, and yet teetotal truth-upendors

The way the money goes. In the N.S.W.
egistrar-General’s office there are two Siberian
aves who act in conjunction with the Registrar-
enoral as Lands Titles Commissioners. These
vo officials are paid by fees, while the Registrar -
eneral receives £750 a year, but no “perks”
hatever, as chairman of the Commission. This
sar the two lucky dogs expect their little re-
uneration to total fully £BOO each. During the
ist month they sat eight hours for which they
ire fully drew £162 10s. between them. If this is
fair sample of their monthly drudgery, it seems
iat they draw £BOO each for 96 hours’ work, or 16
lys of six hours each—exactly £5O a day. If this
oncy comes out of the pockets of those who
igage these fortunate commissioners, they have
ndently more money than brains; but if it
>mes out of the Government Treasury, the Minister
ho sanctions the job should be shot out of office
ithout a moment’s warning.
More and still more re-inforcements are
Ding to Burmah. Already there are about three
ddiers and a field battery keeping guard over
ich nigger for fear he should organise himself and
>bel, and if he lights out for freedom the guns
re ready to shell the inside out of him before ho
in take refuge in the nearest beer-saloon, but
lis armament is not found sufficient. It has been
nacted by Providence that the white man shall
ervade all creation to the confusion of every de
sription of coloured trash, that the pagan who
ghts shall be mashed up so that his own mother
ron’t know him, and that the heathen who runs
way shall have his spine blown out by a long-
ange rifleman, and Anally, that the Bible shall
ver continue to be the true source of England’s
veatness. In obedience to the dictates of
Tovidence Burmah will soon be represented by
no surviving native with a w T ooden leg, and a
Iritish general with a wooden head.
More progress ! Hon. Dr. Mackellarwill, on
,n early date submit, in the N.S.W. Legislative
Jouncil a resolution affirming that no one shall
, e hanged or flogged in pursuance of a judicial
entence who has not been pronounced of sound
aind by a committee of medical experts. Dr.
dackellar says he is convinced that under the pre-
ent system insane people are hanged and flogged,
md as the doctor has long boon chief medical
ifilccr to the Government he ought to know some-
hing about the matter. Very few people have
.yen the faintest idea how much insanity exists in
"he world or how many people pass as being in
heir right minds who arc really the victims of
arain-disease. In all Europe there is only one
royal family which is free from the taint of mad-
ness, and only one hereditary sovereign—the
Emperor of Russia—whose sanity is beyond sus-
picion—unless, indeed, we give the infant King of
Spain the benefit of the doubt, and this alone
should furnish a very instructive lesson.
The Imperial Review (Melbourne) says :
—“France will have the New Hebrides, and Ger-
many Samoa—as certainly as Holland. Germany
and France will agree about these things, and the*
opposition in England itself is tvl save as Aus-
tralia worries Lords Granville and Rosebery in the
persons of Graham Berry and Co., and the Royal
Colonial Institute. . . ’ It is only this trouble-
some province of Victoria that is kicking up the
row, for obviously none of the other Australian
provinces care much. In Victoria it is an upper-
class agitation, as hollow as can be, the middle-
class being almost indifferent, and the working-
class not caring two straws. However, we may
look confidently to the people of Great Britain,
who will never consent to become embroiled with
the French, with the wrong on our side. Note
how the Governor of Victoria, Sir H. B. Loch,
has been reduced to an insignificant puppet by
the intriguing of Sir Graham Berry in London
Mr. Justice Higinbotham must be delighted,
bearing in mind his denunciations of the sj stem
which made Her Majesty’s Ministers in Victoria
subservient to Downing-street and the Governor.
A very fair idea of the style in. which the
insanity dodge has been played off by some of the
favoured criminals of N.S.W. may be gained
from a perusal of the debate in the Upper House
on the case of Louis Bertrand. Dr. Creed quoted
the case of Patrick Hall (a near relative of tho
bushranger, Ben. Hall), who was twice convicted,
and while serving his second sentence, received an
injury, which, it was alleged, would lead to a
danger of losing his life, or reason, if further con-
finement was insisted on. He was, therefore, re-
leased, and in a few days after, this man, whose
health was said to be utterly broken down, and
whose brain was supposed to be fast giving way,
found to be most ably conducting intricate
business with a solicitor on a question of land, and
was riding long journeys on horseback through
the bush in perfect health of body and mind.
Bertrand’s own case was equally remarkable, for
shortly after he was relegated to a lunatic asylum
as being too mad even for the gallows, he was
actually engaged as ciachman to the supermten
dent of tho asylum, and was at liberty to drive
the wife of that officer about the streets of Parra-
matta. This we take to be the highest confidence
that can be placed in a coachman.

There was some disappointment felt last
Thursday when it was found that Lady Carington
would not be “at home ” as usual, but had flitted
with H.E. to the National Park. A considerable
number of visitors to Sydney had put off' their re-
turn for a few days in order that they might “look
in” on vice-royalty, and it is needless to say they
thought her ladyship might have stayed in to see
them and gone a-parking some other day.
* * *
His Excellency and Lady Carington gave a
large musical party on Tuesday evening, the 28th
September. A “select” party of the Sydney
Liedertafel were “ rounded up ” by a well-known
gentleman to sing for the amusement of the guests
on the occasion ; hence much discord in musical
quarters. By the way, not a few people attended
the affair thinking there was to be a dance.

H.M.S. Nelson leaves Sydney on the 14th
inst. for Melbourne, where she will remain for
the races. Then she will no doubt find her way
to Hobart, in order that the Russians may not find
the place defenceless during “ the season.”
* * *
A very successful and fashionable concert
was given in Sydney Protestant Hall on Ist inst.
by professional and amateur performers. A
duet on two pianos by Mrs. Boesen and
Mrs. W. Cooper was well received. Miss
Frances Saville sang in charming style,
her appearance greatly enhancing the effect.
Her toilet was a most tasteful one, the front of
the skirt a mass of thick white jetted lace, per-
fectly fitting bodice (also richly jetted) and very
long train of rich brocade, cream and pink being
the predominant colours. Lord and Lady Caring-
ton, with a largo Government House party, were
present, and took much interest in the performance.
The front of the stage was beautifully decorated
with flowers and evergreens. Immediately in the
front stood a lyre almost covered with tiny
white flowers, the whole having a most pleasing
effect. The hall was well filled. We should think
that a good sum will be handed over to Miss
Bessie Doyle (a most promising young musician,
pupil of Herr Josef Kretschmann), for whose
benefit the concert was given.

H.M.S. Miranda lias returned to Sydney
from the Islands. The reports are—sport dull
and niggers shy. Tickled a few of ’em with ball

Jubilee, illuminating a few villages with shell.

Captain Brooke and the officers of H.M.
p opular ship Opal gave an afternoon dance on board
at Farm Cove on Wednesday, 29th inst. The Opal
is comparatively small, but every effort had been
made to utilise all the space possible. Some time
ago the officers of this ship attempted to give a
dance on shore, but they were sternly forbidden
to do so by the Admiral. They have, however,
done their best to return the hospitality of Sydney.
If there was any fault to find with the supper it
was that it was more sumptuous than was neces-
sary. The hosts had wisely restricted the number
of guests, and, as they had protected the gang-
ways with a file of marines and loaded guns, few
who had not been asked thought it worth while
to attend. The crew of this ship are daily
expecting the arrival of the Thalia, the vessel
that is to relieve them. Consequently, they had
a homeward-bound pendant flying from the main.
As usual, there was a good deal of dancing, the band
of H.M.S. Nelson performing admirably. Lady
Carington was attired in a very simple and quiet
costume of brown cloth, with golden embroidered
panels, bonnet and parasol en suite ; Mrs. Arthur
Blackwood appeared in cream brocaded satin and
gold bonnet.

A beautiful little example of feminine
spite is subjoined. It came to us on scented paper
enclosed in a pink envelope:—“A social writer
has a pretty story, and loves to tell it. It’s this :
‘ Oh, do you know, the dear Governor told me he
cannot bear to read any ‘ social ’ but mine. He
says ” —and so on. It is back-scratching with a
vengeance, as H.E. is spoken of in terms that
make his mistress a bad second, and Albert a
worse third.

The inaugural performance of the Burwood
Amateur Dramatic Association took place at the
local School of Arts, on 30th ult. The pieces
played were “Betsy Baker” and “Little Toddle-
kins.” The Misses Sandeman and Miss Friend
sustained a portion of the responsibility, and did
not disappoint; while of the gentlemen Mr.
Christopher Little bore off the principal honors.
The large and fashionable audience were at the
outset of the performance electrified by a pro-
logue in verse of a distinctly Burwoodish brand,
the bard being Mr. G. Cansdell. The object of
the entertainment was to pay the expenses. The
object came off.

“The Vagabond’s” diplomacy, writes a
Bulletin correspondent, “shone forth at Chester
Town Hall the other day, on the occasion of the
presentation of the Colonial gang to the magnates
of this place. The Duke of Westminster took
down to dinner the local lady mayoress. Follow-
ing this august couple, the Mayor had on his arm
the present beautiful Duchess of Westminster (No.
2,by the way). Hard on the heels of this aristocratic
pair what spectacle, think you, met the disgusted
eyes of Burdett Smith and Co., who were far off in
the rear 2 Not to prolong the agony, the third
couple consisted of the ever immortal Julian
Thomas, upon whom rested the nude and some-
what over-plump arm of the wife of the Bishop of
Chester. When Burdett beheld this he closed his
eyes and almost fell off in a swoon on the tesselated
pavement.”

An irreverent Australian who has just met
the Prince of Wales in England thus writes to a
Queensland friend: —“Albert Edward, who re-
ceived F and myself in what I suppose should
be termed a ‘ gracious ’ manner, is a fat —perhaps
I should say squat—bald-headed man of the
German Jew type. He talked with us for several
minutes and seemed to be anxious to give one the
idea that he thinks himself no better than the
man he is talking to. But nevertheless I somehow
formed the impression that if you allowed him to
see that you entirely coincided with him in his
estimate of himself he would endeavour to sit
down on you ‘in one act.’ I have met in Aus-
tralia scores and scores of far more kingly men
than the Heir Apparent—he appears to be right
down commonplace in fibre. He is not taller than
T. N. Fitzgerald, the Melbourne surgeon, but
what a pigmy he would look alongside that
Napoleonically broad-browed little man, who, I
see, was selected to write, and has written, for
the latest edition of the best-known English sur-
gical text-book the article on hydatids. That is
what I call fame ! The selection is indeed an
honour for Fitz. ; the colonies are lucky in possess-
ing n surgeon who, if he chose to settle in London,
would make —well, perhaps neither he nor any
other man could anywhere make much more than
his present professional incomeof say£ls,oooayear.
Returning, however, to A. E. I was told the
other day that he had dismissed his valet because
the latter, in shaving him, presumed to catch hold
of the royal nose. The dignity of the Crown has,
it is plain, to be jealously guarded now-a-days.”

The scene is laid in Government House,
longitude 115, Australia. A dinner party was
assembled, and an exiled flunkey had just finished
banging a gong when the hostess —a pretty but
superstitious lady who, according to report, is a
spiritualist and amuses herself by calling up dead
sinners and asking them how they like the climate
—gave a cry of horror, and exclaimed, “I won’t
go to dinner! There are 13 ! ” Reasoning, coaxing,
and entreaty, were all of no avail. The lady was
immovable ; the Governor grew mad ; and the

guests, who saw their victuals fading away till they
looked like Chinese perspective, used hungry
western cusses under their breath. Fortunately a
happy thought struck the lady, else they might all
be waiting yet. She summoned the gorgeous
menial and said : “James, give my compliments
to Mr. Bigphool; tell him to get ready as quickly
as possible and come to dinner.” There was
another awful pause, during which the guests
grew ravenous enough to devour each other, but
just as the Governor was beginning to -give vent
to some remarks, and the cook down-stairs was
subsiding into tears over the ruined dinner, the
door opened, Mr. Bigphool appeared in swallow-
tail and the crisis was over.

“In Melbourne, another disease from which they
suffer is the English, or rather Scottish, Sunday ;
which in one way came to our relief, as, when wo
arrived at our place of destination, the Customs
officials were at prayers and allowed us to pass
into the town unmolested. . . . Public-houses
are entirely closed on Sunday here, but the bottle
passes vigorously at the street corners, and if peo-
ple ever do get drunk in Melbourne, be sure they
doit on the ‘blessed Sabbath.’” The table at
Menzies’ Hotel pleased him, but of the attendants
he writes : “ There is a strange air of familiarity
about the servants, as, indeed, there is about all
people employed in what we at home consider
menial positions in these colonies. Don’t think I
object to this ; I don’t; so long as men and women
do their work, I have always been ready to accord
them full freedom to anything short of absolute
rudeness ; indeed, undue civility is ever distaste-
ful to me—it only means expectation of gratuity.
Still, no one can help feeling surprise at the
change. I felt surprised, and so I commit my
surprise to paper. Almost as soon as I got ashore
I was seized with an acute attack of mine ancient
enemy the gout. When I began to get about,
‘ Well, how’s the gout this morning V or, ‘ Hullo,
your game leg seems a bit better,’ in a tone which
suggested ‘ old feller ’ at the end of the sentence,
was my usual morning’s salutation from the more
agreeable of the men servants. Not the waiters,
who are too busy to talk and who are fairly polite,
but the other men, the porters and cleaners and
gentry of that ilk.”

There are a good many stories thrown
against the “ books ”by the holy brethren. Here
is another stone, but there’s some gold in it. When
Holt’s wife was left pretty well penniless, it was
not the club men, who had made thousands out of
him over the “ green cloth,” that helped her in her
sorrow; but the loud-voiced sons of the ring put
together no less a sum than £7OO, and started the
poor lady back to her friends. More than this,
they mean to give her husband a “lift” when ho
gets out and finds himself “cut” by the crowd
who “travelled” with him when ho was on the
road to ruin. Just throw that stone again. It
will never hit a Union Clubman.

Even the red-headed aristocrat and the
lady with the perpetual cold who haunt Govern-
ment House, Sydney, can learn something in the
matter of toadyism from N. 55. Lady Jervois, lilted
Lady Carington, is charitably inclined, and him-
particular fad is an annual doll-show, the
of which go to buy unmentionables for the local I
heathen. This year her consignment of undressed
wax and wooden babies came to hand as usual,
and she appealed to the ladies who compose Wel-
lington ‘ ‘ sassiety ” to undertake the duty of mak-
ing garments for the naked innocents. A day
was fixed accordingly when all the tone of the
capital was to roll up and the images were to be
taken away for the purpose of being dressed,
but an hour before the time some ladies, who 1
were not “ in sassiety,” got in and abducted the
consignment, leaving only three broken-nosed
dolls behind. They sent word that they intended
undertaking the work themselves, and, of course,,
hope to And admission to Government House when
they bring back their load. Lady Jervois is so*
mad that she is half inclined to send a policeman
to recover her property.

As the lowest blackguards in Sydney now
delight in holding high revel at Googee, the trams
running in that direction often carry heavy
top-loads of larrikins. The other day a foul-
mouthed hoodlum, who regards the wide world as
a mere spittoon, incontinently expectorated on the
hat of a gentleman who had the misfortune to be
his travelling companion. The latter, a quiet
person who is not to be trifled with, calmly took
off his tile and deliberately wiped it on the artis-
tically-braided paget coat of the man with
the mouth. The latter, white with passion,
doubled up his fist, perceiving which the man
with the hat at once gave his carefully-dressed
friend a lightning backhander that made him
“ see stars.” The gentlemanfrom Woollooraooloo
dropped dead for two minutes. Then he came
round a bit, but considered it advisable to be half-
dead for five minutes more. Presently ho stood
up somewhat “ groggily,” and on being asked in a
most brutally cynical manner “ whether he wanted
any more ?” blurted out; “Oh, you’re too good
for me. But (in a sulky tone), “ I don’t see why
you should a made such a noise about that. A
follow’d think you was a nobleman or a dook.”

This is how a London paper refers to the
recent beslavering of “ representative Austra-
lians :—“ Some of the money voted for the pur-
pose of entertaining them has been wasted in the
perpetration of great follies, and our reckless
method of procedure is likely to give them the
wrongest of impressions with regard to England’s
real financial position.” Just so. Now that our
well-fed friends are returning to us, we shall hear
much about the increased prosperity of England,
and the improved condition of the masses. Our
representative ones have been looking at English
life through champagne-glasses and the smoke of
shilling cigars. When men who leave their
country in disgust, and with twopence in their
pockets, return thither to be stroked down by
obsequious mayors and corporations, it is hard for
those men to believe that their native coimtry
hasn’t been going ahead during their absence, or
that the people haven’t all been making their
piles. They erroneously compare the struggling
friends of their youth with the ostentatious enter-
tainers of their old ages.

Foster (eldest daughter of Hon. W. J. Foster,

George-street printer. The bride wore a handsome
white ottoman silk draped in the front with
orange blossoms and wreath to match, with long
tulle veil. The chief bridesmaid, Miss Helen
Foster, and the second, Miss M‘Lardy, were attired
in white embroidered muslins, white lace hats
with cream feathers, and looked exceedingly
pretty. Miss Jeffreys, of Molong, a little fairylike
maiden of two years old, was the third brides-
maid. A number of handsome costumes were

youngest daughter of Captain Adams. The bride,
in the usual wedding attire, looked very pretty ;
also the seven bridesmaids, who were dressed in
pure white China silk, each carrying a bouquet
horse-shoe shape, composed entirely of Marguerite
daisies. A large number of guests were present.
A dance in the evening, attended by about 70
visitors, brought the day to a pleasant end.

You’re the airiest thing,
Light as bird on the wing.
Or a skyward leaf on a tall, tall tree.
Or as flowers that rest
On a new bride’s breast,
Or as light as a false lover’s perjury.
In this world of whirls,
Where the white-necked girls
Are brilliant in lace, and are flushing with glee,
Perchance I might say
You are like to the spray
That is white on the waves of the wind-brown sea.
Where the tread keeps time
In a sliding rhyme
To the grand “ Blue Danube ” or sweet “ Ma Vie,”
You’re a floating belle,
As your partners tell,
The best in the room—that is their decree.
In resplendent halls,
Where the waltz-tune falls
Like a cadence from heaven’s own harmony,
Oh, your dancing rare
Is beyond compare,
You are queen of the realm where the light feetgled
The ball’s nearly done,
The last dance but one,
An enjoyable night, so they all agree ;
But—l’ve something to say,
You are going ? No, stay
Just a minute—now don’t turn away from me.
Ye 5, I know, there’s the band,
But don’t dip out your hand,
Here’s your programme—my dance —we’re en-
gaged. you see;
Take me and my name,
Look, I’ll spell yours the some —
It’s for life now, as well as for twenty-three,

Lord Carington says he is not going in for yachting much
himself. This is to be regretted, as so many would follow

The East Sydney Football Club picnic at Longueville was a

ended, as usual, with victuals, an arrangement which seemed
to give general satisfaction.

The hot wind carried up a lady's beautiful hack-hair in a
crowded street, iu South Melbourne, and left her blushing

On Saturday afternoon Mrs. Edward Moriarty gave a
most successful garden party at her residence, North Shore.
Between 50 and 60 guests were present. Dancing and singing
was the order of the programme.
A leading Sydney undertaker went to a recent hospital
ball with his family in a mourning coach. The sad procession
moved from his residence at 9 p.m,, and returned at that

“ It seems to me,” said Mrs. Foxpaw's particular friend,
“ that dear Maria is living in better style than ever since she

gave her.”
The Bombala Quadrille Club held their first ball in the
local School of Arts on Wednesday, the 29th September. The
programme included 24 dances, and the ladies’ dresses and
the excellent supper made up for ary slight deficiencies in
the music.
There are no old maids in Japan. When a woman doesn’t

“ Menevia,” Snail’s Bay (N.S.W.), was, on Friday, 24th
ult., the scene of a pleasurable dance, given to signalise the
occupancy of the villa by its new tenants. Every provision
had been made for the comfort of the guests, who danced
With much emphasis till daylight.
Tight-lacing goes on as badly as ever. At a Sydney
Suburban hop, recently, a loud report was heard, which
proved to be the bodice of a too-tightly-compressed damsel
bursting from her shoulder to her waist! And “ oh, what a
falling off was there !” She was hastily enveloped in blushes
and a cloud.
On Wednesday, the 29th ult., an Oxford and Cambridge
dinner came off at Baumann’s Cafe, Sydney. Oyer 50 guests
were present, including Lord Carington (jn the chair), Bishop
Barry, Professor Scott, Mr. Wallington, and others. Toasts
were crowded in as thickly as there was room for. Affair

In a N.S.W. town there is a hank-manager who is so lovely

enamoured of himself.
„At a Sydney wedding (which would have been very
fashionable ” had it not been very (inlet) the other day, a
young woman turned up, accompanied by a three-year-old
doy, whom she insisted on bringing under the notice of the
bridegroom. However, the bride didn’t seem to mind—she
told ’em to go ahead with the music. And they did,
We must not he too hard on the Sydney Government
House young man who wears the balloon trousers, and the

are the custom in this country. Courtney, M.P., presented
himself to be sworn in the Commons lately, neatly attired

sky-blue necktie, and with a red flower in his button-hole.
A fascinating young London lady, who can handle the
pbbons, has resolved to be independent and make a for-
tune. She proposes, therefore, to start a splendid hansom
cab, to drive it herself, and charge triple fares. Should she
be patronised she will start sevex-al more, each driven by a
young lady. The idea is a joyous one. No more shall the
brutal cabby descend from his perch at 3 a.m. to take it
°ut.of the penniless swell.
‘ One thing is certain,” says an English paper. “ Everybody
officially connected with the Exhibition is delighted with the
Prince of Wales. He has treated them all royally, and on
several occasions has personally seen to the comfort of the
commissioners. The climax was reached the other day
when several of them had tea with the royal family, the
Princess with her own fair hands pouring out the fragrant
jmhea, and inquiring with her own sweet voice if they all
took milk and sugar.
Dr. Wynne, who went broke recently in London, seems to
have the financing bump well developed. He said that a
gentleman had been paying him £550 a year “ for being

At this year's British Medical Association Congress the
lament spoke on “the higher education of women, con-
A in the light of Herbert Spencer’s dictum—that the
that t re( } u ' s i tie of good living was to be a good animal, and
nat- t 0 , a nation of good animals was a first condition of

Captain Pincombe, who seems to have

In Australia when a captain runs his ship
ashore out of sheer pig-headedness, the news is
published as “Marine Intelligence.” And simi-

cell, the item is labelled “ Police Intelligence.”
It is now reported that Alexander of Bul-

his boots in his hand for want of time to put them
on.

Mrs. Taylor, the Melbourne “nurse,”
who was tried for malpractice last w T eek, is a most
difficult lady to suit with jurors. Nothing in the
shape of a bald head or a grey beard goes down
with Mrs. T. This is unkind, considering how
much bald-headed men have, indirectly, done for
her, at one time or another.
The proprietress of a Melbourne hash-
foundry sued a boarder who refused to pay his
rent. It was proved that he was under age, and
the clerk of the Court cheerfully reminded her
that providing for minors “ was a mug’s game.”
“He’s not a miner,” growled the purveyor of
homes for single men ; “he’s a railway porter.”
Judge Innes complains of the immense
strain of work placed upon the Supreme Court
Judges of N.S.W., and risks the opinion that
when a judge some day dies on the Bench more
consideration will be shown for his surviving
brethren. If Judge Innes feels that his brain re-
quires a thorough rest the best thing for him to do
is to take a seat on the jury. We are ready to
draw his salary.
In these pleasure-seeking days it is inter-
esting to learn of a novel recreation. The Mel-
bourne Jews —we have it on the authority of a
local paper—“spent their time in fasting and
lengthy devotional exercises” upon their New Year's
I )ay. This should be a valuable hint to the blase
man of the world who is bored to death for want
of something to do. He can occupy himself with
not eating anything for 21 hours.
The 1200 juveniles attending the Mayoress
of Melbourne’s fancy dress ball are to be photo-
graphed at their hostess’s expense. In the ordinary
course of things a certain percentage of these
young people will live to bo photographed at their
country’s expense—in quite a different sort of
fancy dress. We don’t want to damp their
ardour just at the very outset of their career,
but our assertion can be backed up with figures.
Speaking of the so-called N.S.W. Defence
Force, Plain Bill observed that Captain Walker,
whilst engaged night and day laying down tor-
pedoes during the Russian scare, was also “ ad-
ministering the great Telegraph Department of
the colony.” Just so. And the infuriated people
of this country were whooping mad to know why
the great Telegraph Department couldn’t hurry a
special “wire ” along any faster than a wooden-
legged man could kick his hat.
It is just 150 years since the last case of
“pressing to death” took place in England. In
those good old times when a man was brought up
for stealing a loaf, or something of the kind, and
refused to plead, they tied him down on the floor
and put a stone weighing 1001 b. on his stomach.
If he still, kept silent, the weight was gradually
increased to 3501 b. and then the executioner
jumped on him and finished the job. We can
afford to shudder at these things, for no legal
atrocity half so awful has happened in N.S.W.
these four months.
An Adelaide paper, reporting a cattle
show held a fortnight ago, said that “ His Honor
and Mr. C. Rake were the only exhibition of
Poland China boars, and two splendid speci-
mens they were. Here, too, the judges were set a
difficult task, but they decided in favour of Mr.
Rake. These two immense pigs were all that
could be desired, and naturally enough they came
in for a large amount of attention.” The law of
libel must be loose in S. A. We know of a good
many eminent men in Sydney who answer the
above description admirably, but it would cost us
more than we care to think of if wo alluded to
them as “ these immense pigs.”
Some of the Melbourne papers have made
George Darrell sit up by asserting, through the
medium of a letter, that he plagiarised the “ Sog-
garth” from one of “ Garryowen’s” (Edmund
Finn’s) stories. Now George is going to make the
papers sit up, to which end he will use £lO,OOO
worth of blue paper as a lever. Before the case
goes to the jury, your Honor, we would like to
ask the plaintiff a question. Is it not a fact, Mr.
Darrell, that much of the interest of the drama
you dedicated to Plain Bill lies in the fact that
your gory villain makes the Soggarth an accom-
plice to his crimes by revealing the same to him
in the confessional ? And that the pivot on which
what is called your “ dinner-mong ” turns is the
unwary reference by the said villain to the afore-
said crimes, when the before-mentioned Soggarth
alone was present, and no sacramental seal of
secresy closed his lips, as in the former case ?
Answer in the affirmative. Then, your Honor,
wo submit that plaintiff is entitled only to a non-
suit, as the principal story in Mrs. Hall’s well-
known book, “ Legends and Stories of Ireland,
turns on exactly the same incident.
THE AUSTRALIAN
POLICEMAN.
t
We have a new find out to communi-
cate to the world, and are as proud thereof
as a boy with a broken arm. The police of
Australia are getting fat. Treat it not
lightly, dear reader ; tis a matter of vast
moment, and a grim fact. Taken from his
shovel and his hoe, and placed upon a
heat where the languishing cook, and the
big meat-pie abound, the youthful pro-
tector of our persons and our portable
valuables rapidly acquires oleaginous
matter, and feelingly appeals to thecountiy
for more uniform. The muscular, wiry
constable, with an eye which penetrated
like a gimlet, is but a memory. Ho is dead
and to-day his beat resounds with the
elephantine tread of an epicurean copper.
The policeman’s best friend cannot but ad-
mit that his efficiency is impaired by otiose-
ness. A man in the last stages of fatty de-
generation cannot be -expected to pursue
the fleet larrikin with success, or capture a circus-tiger, out on a visit, with the celerity necessary to the public peace. Then the snow-dropper, the
chicken-thief, and the gay garotter, are turning the development to account, and rarely do we peruse our respected morning contemporary without strik-
ing a case of some wily footpad butting a zealous officer in the vest, and getting right back to the Barcoo with a peaceable citizen’s property, while the
public servant is fossicking round for wind. The frugal wife of the Sydney “ trap ” finds material enough in his discarded inexpressibles to make the son
and heir a sabbath suit and a school cap, and have scraps sufficient for a patch-work quilt, a door-mat, and a kettle-holder ; this is a good thing for his
family, we admit, but how about our bleeding country ? Endeavours of a strenuous nature must he made to restrain the force’s tendency towards corpu-
lency, or a hard-working community will soon he saddled with the hoarding and lodging of a few battalions of waddling comatose monsters—they can’t all
get into the Waxworks. There is but one remedy, and we give it to every purchaser of a copy of The Bulletin. Bind the cooks over to keep the pieces.


BEFORE AND AFTER.
1 ‘ Will you have a plate of Icecream, dear!” he asked. “ No,
thank you, I never eat cream in the winter,” she sweetly re-
plied “ Well, do try a dish of those delicious Oysters, won’t
you, pet,” he continued. “ No, Alfred, they are so dear,”
“I thought I was the only thing that was dear.” “Oh,
Alfred, I must go home.” “ I am so sorry," he said. “ Oh,
pet I know what you want. Let me order a bottle of that
famous St. Louis Lager Beer?” Her Beautiful blue eyes
lighted up. Just a tint of crimson appeared upon her lovely
face. When she could breath easy, she said, “ Oh, Alfred
do.”

is the latest triumph of
Science. It is a noble
alloy, possessing the enact lustre, beauty
and endurance of sterling Sold. A legi-
timate use has been found for this noble metal, by
working it into Jewellery of the most exquisite de-
signs. The Oriental Gold Co.,
of 474 George St,, Sydney, has
large consignments of these lovely goods, which they
sell at a fraction of the oest of Sterling Gold Jewellery,
No one can detect the difference. Send for a

ESTABLISHED 1883.
WE have again much pleasure in addressing
our customers and the public. The rapid
expansion of our business, and the repeated orders
we receive from customers who dealt with us as
far back as 1882, are gratifying proofs that our
Goods and our method of doing business give
satisfaction.
We continue the same system. We buy direct
from the makers in London, Paris, and New York
all such Goods, Watches, &c., as are not the pro-
duct of our Company’s own works. We add a
fair and reasonable profit, and SELL FOR CASH,
thus avoiding bad debts, and steering clear of the
evil system of charging rates which compel paying
customers to make good the default of bad marks
HERE IS THE BASIS OF OUR SYSTI M.
The full value must accompany any order, or no attention
will be paid to it. Payment can be made by Postage Starnes
of any Australian colony up to £1 worth, by Cheque or uy
P. O. 0., payable to the Oriental Gold Co.
The Goods ordered will be sent at once. If they a'c not
approved they may be returned per first post after delivery
uninjured, and we will, according to the wish of the customer,
either substitute another article to same value, or
WE RETURN THE MONEY IN PULL
deducting merely the trifle of actual postal charges.
Thus; Suppose you want a Brooch—you describe, as nearly
as possible, the sort of pattern you prefer, or you leave the
choice entirely to us, and you remit, say 10s.
We endeavour to match your description, if sent, or n any
case we do our best to please and satisfy you.
On receiving the Brooch, or other article, if you don t entirely
like the pattern or style, write by first mail explaining in whas
respect you would like it to differ—returning the Rrooci n>
the same good order as you received it —thereupon we win
try again, and send a second one to same value.
Or, if you don’t like the first Brooch at all, and want your
money back, we will send back the full sum, less the posrar
outlay incurred.
We make this pledge in all seriousness, although whh
something of a light heart; because, although we have iui>.
thousands of orders by post on same terms, dMvag r»

A REMARKABLE FACT
in connection with the late Calcutta Exhibition,
and one which cannot be too highly valued for its
peculiar bearing upon these colonies, is the in-
creased knowledge of Australia which has been
already manifested through its agency, and the
evident interest that has been awakened in a direc-
tion in which it would be highly profitable and
in every sense advantageous for us to have
intimate relationship.
THE CITY OF PALACES,
As the metropolis of British India is called, is a
commercial centre of great importance ; and when
our hopes are realized of a big trade being opened
between these colonies and that vast emporium,
the advantages will be in every way enormous.
The population of Calcutta in 1881 was 683,458 —
that is without Howrah.
Among the many
SUCCESSFUL EXHIBITORS
at the Calcutta Exhibition were the proprietors of
St. Jacobs Oil, the world renowned remedy. Day
by day this great boon and true
FRIEND OF SUFFERING HUMANITY
is extending its beneficial influence. Testimonials,
unsolicited, are sent to the agents, accompanied
by grateful expressions of thankfulness on the part
of those who have been saved from disorders of
various kinds, or who have been relieved from pain
of long-standing by the timely use of the Oil, which
acts like a charm. Necessarily, the agents are un-
able to do more than select a few from the large
number of letters sent; and it may have been
observed that such as have been published repre-
sent all classes of society—persons engaged in all
manner of pursuits, from the hardy miner and the
sailor, whose occupations are those of hardship and
exposure, to the office clerk and others engaged in
sedentary occupations, and also the wealthy free-
liver.
ONE OF THE EXHIBITS
that obtained special distinction was, as we have
said, St. Jacobs Oil, the most celebrated medicine
of its class, perhaps in the world. The experience
of the Judges appointed to award prizes enabled
them to confer upon it a distinction never before
bestowed upon any other patent medicine, and
they accordingly award it
THE GOLD MEDAL.
Testimonials of the most convincing character,
showing the marvellous curative powers of the
Oil, as locally experienced, were forthcoming ; and
it was on the strength of these, and the general
evidence presented to them, that the Jurors
awarded the medal. This fact speaks volumes, I
and needs no explanation or comment to further 1
recommend it.
IMPORTANT TESTIMONY
of the value of the cure has been furnished by the
Inspector of Post-Offices at Calcutta, who used the
oil with most beneficial results whilst an inmate of
the Hospital at Sealdah, suffering from smallpox
It is as follows :
“Campbell Hospital, Sealdah,
Calcutta.
“Having heard of the healing and curative
powers of St. Jacobs Oil in cases of sore throats,
pains, &c., and suffering while in this institution
with a sore throat, I obtained the permission of the
medical officers, who attended me for small pox,
to use it, and have much pleasure in stating that
a single application gave me much relief, and in
three days, using the oil twice daily, I felt rid of
the sore throat. I have no hesitation in recom-
mending the use of the same to others, and feel
sure they will find the oil gives instantaneous
relief. I would also here mention that with the
sore throat I had a severe pain in the jaws, which I
was removed after only two appliations of St. I
Jacobs Oil.
“ (Signed) E. A. Pereira,
“Head Inspector of Post-Offices.’
ACCEPTED BY THE FACULTY.
It will be observed that the above testimonial
derives an additional value to the great majority
that have been published, from the fact of the
medical officers of that institution having so far
recognised the merit of St. Jacobs Oil as to re com-
mend its use by a patient under their care. This,
however, is not the only instance of the “faculty ”
having overcome proverbial prejudice.
FURTHER AFIELD. ,
Leaving Calcutta and coming nearer home, we
may take a peep at a pretty little city in the
Britain of the South, as some people call it. The
writer refers to Christchurch, New Zealand. There
are many old residents of New Zealand now
located here, and, apart from what is known in
that colony as provincial jealousy—a feeling
which, the writer believes, is fast dying out —those
New'Zealanders will ready admit
THE CATHEDRAL CITY
to be one of the prettiest of the towns in the two
islands. It was a Church of England settlement
originally, and has remained very English—very
much “Church of England”—and just a little
slow-going and Conservative, perhaps, ever since.
It has an extensive back country, and the output
of grain and wool from the port (Lyttelton) each
year is very extensive. Here, in this city, some |
time since, one of those useful exhibitions was
held, the building having been erected not far
from the banks of the pretty artesian river, with 1
its fringe of weeping willows —the last to shed
their leaves, and the first to don again their deli-
cate garb of green.
THE AVON
is the name of this stream upon which boating
parties enjoy themselves during the milder months
of the year, and which meanders through the
town, and constitutes one of the great attractions
of Christchurch.
Walking though the Exhibition Building during
the latter days of its brief existence the writer
came upon
AN OLD FRIEND,
or rather a somewhat new friend —a friend that
has done much for a great many people in this
world of aches and pains. It was St. Jacobs Oil,
which here also gained the distinction of a gold
medal. Throughout New Zealand the oil has
effected some remarkable cures, and testimonials
to that effect have been freely given by both
Europeans and Maoris —the latter regard it as
magical.
A SHORT RETROSPECT.
But who, it may be asked are the proprietors of
this St. Jacobs Oil that we heard so much about ?
And by way of anticipating such an enquiry, the
writer proceeds at one to state the facts.
The firm is styled the Charles A. Vogeler
Company, and is at present composed of Mr.
Chrisian Devries (President of the National Bank
of Baltimore), Mrs. M. A. Vogeler (widow of the
late Mr. C. A. Vogeler), and Mr. H. D. Umstaetter
(a journalist of high repute, and the author of some
well-known humorous works).
The offices and works of the firm are located at
Nos. 184, 186, and 188, W. Lombard-street, Balti-
more ; and over 600 hands are employed on the
premises, including the largest printing office in
the State, regularly engaged in producing the
“ St. Jacobs Oil Family Calendar, and Book of
Health and Humour. 1 ’

ANDREW BERGLAND.
Above is a portrait of Andrew Bergland, the brave sailor
who, at the disastrous wreck of the Ly-ee-Moon, so gallantly
saved the life of the boy Adams. Bergland, who is a man of
splendid physique and only 26 years of age, is now actively
practising as a sculler, and bids fair to become one of the
champions of Australia at no distant date. Elias Laycock,
who has watched his practice, is reported to have said that
he would give £5000 to have his strength and chances.
Miss Blanche : “Wouldn’t you say, Mr. Bow-
string, that Mr. Highnote has a falsetto voice?’
Mr. Bowstring: “Well, I don’t know, Miss
Blanche, as I should say quite that; but I know
that he has a false set o’ teeth, and does not wear
one of those beautiful and stylish £3 3s. suits, to
measure, cut by one of the eight high-class cutters
employed by Summerfleld and Company, the great
juvenile outfitters, 235 and 237, Pitt-street,
Sydney.
Mittchell’s old established and reliable original
reform chemist shop, 141 King-street, was recently
purchased by A. A. Rigney, of Bega, who will
conduct both establishments on the standard prin-
ciples for which he is well known.
CALLED BACK.
The busy throng in Pitt-street is called back to
gaze with wonder at the beautiful display of Spring
goods in the windows of Summerfleld and Company.
The well-known excellence of our boys’ clothing,
the pretty designs and moderate prices need no
comment. For big boys and youths, we are show-
ing a very superior line of long trousers suits at

A Good Remedy for a Cold.—On going to bed
take a dose of Freeman’s Chlorodyne, either in
water or camphor mixture. The diaphoretic action
of this excellent remedy speedily produces a
general glow, followed by a free perspiration, dur-
ing which the pulse improves in character from a
feeble to a full, elastic one, a good night’s sleep is
obtained, and on waking in the morning the cold
will be found to have dissapeared. The certainty
of the action of Freeman’s Chlorodyne is very re-
markable in Ague; it frequently prevents an
attack, or, failing this, reduces the violence of the
ague fit to a minimum. In many countries Free-
man’s Chlorodyne has entirely superseded the use
of Quinine, and in the tea gardens of India noth-
ing else is given for Ague and other forms of Fever.
Insist upon having “Freeman’s” only. Trade
mark, an Elephant.—obtainable from all chemists
and storekeepers.
IN THE PAST THIRTY YEARS
There have been many remedies advertised for the cure of
kidney and liver troubles and diseases of the urinary organs.
Of only one can it be said “It is never known to fail.” That
one is Dr. Bell’s (Kidney and Liver) Bitters.
Said he: “ I’ve been married thirty years and
have never given my wife one cross word.”
“ That’s because you never dared to, uncle,” said
a little nephew; “if you had auntie would have
made you hop.” Silence fell upon the circle, until
the red-headed servant girl came in and remarked
that the boy had better put on his new half-guinea
wear-resisting suit that had just arrived from
Summerfleld and Company, the Great Juvenile
Out fitters 235 and 237, Pitt-street, Sydney.
The Queen’s visit to the Colonial Exhibition
had curious results. Society flocked to the shew
and the throng of beautiful women of the highest!
rank was unprecedented since the earlier part of
Her Majesty’s reign. The ladies’ dresses were an
exhibition of themselves, and the swell operators
among the London cut-purses made a field-day
The Duchess of Westminster had a jewelled watch-
chain, worth two hundred guineas, neatly cub
away with pincers, and Lady Dudley lost a neckleft
and locket, valued at three hundred and seventy-
five guineas for the gold and gems alone. As a
work of art and a family jewel the locket was
priceless. The Hon. Mrs. Cholmondely had a
jewelled bracelet actually stolen from her arm in
the pressure, and a most audacious attempt was
made to snatch a diamond earring from the ear
of the Countess of Exeter by a person who dis-
appeared in the crowd. Not any of the stolen
jewels have been recovered, despite the utmost
exertions of the police. The Marchioness of Ely
also lost a most exquisite necklet and locket, the
beauty of which had but a few minutes before
been commented on by the Princess Beatrice in
the private retiring rooms of the royal party ; and
Lady Rosebery had a massive albert chain snipped
clean away from her watch. In these last two
instance, however, London Society is laughing at
the expense of the thieves. It appears that a
great number of the leaders of fashion in England
warned by past losses, do not wear their family
jewels on public occasions, or when shopping
They take the precaution to wear jewellery which
is indistinguishable from sterling gold and real
gems, but which, despite its beauty and lasting
quality,! s com aratively costless. This is known
as Oriental Gobi, which is made in all the most
delicate and beautiful designs, and can therefore
be worn with impunity by the highest ladies In
the case of Lady Rosebery and the Marchioness
of Ely it was these goods which deceived even the
practised eye of the cleverest London swell mobs-
men, and which had called forth the encomiums of
the Princess Beatrice. This curious incident has
occasioned quite a sensation in London, and has
created an extraordinary demand for these oriental
gold articles of jewellery. The manufacturers
have a branch in Sydney at 474, George-street.

not be out of the fashion.

Last week, Mr. Marsh, S.M., of Sydney,
in sentencing to four months’ imprisonment a man
convicted of indecency, told prisoner that he had
narrowly escaped being flogged : “It was his
previous good character alone which stood him in
good stead, and saved him an ignominy which,
had he been subjected to it, might have driven him
to perdition.” The Bulletin recognises in this
magisterial utterance a sign of progress. A res-
pected magistrate has publicly stated that the
lash is an ignominy calculated to drive to
perdition the man who receives it. Up to the
present moment flogging has been airily dispensed
in the civilised colony of N.S.W. as though it
were whisky and seltzer, or ham sandwiches, or
holy water. But, anyhow, N.S.W. is getting rid
of convictism by degrees, and will be quit of it en-
tirely when the last of the old fogies now in
authority is shot into the dustheap. Four years
ago they tied up and brutally flogged a man with
ten years’ good character, who had unconsciously
done an act of indecency while drunk. To-day,
however willing they may be to act otherwise,
they are restrained by the growing force of public
opinion from going through the hideously unmean-
ing atrocity of lashing a depraved creature with
probably a diseased brain, even though that crea-
ture has been found guilty on what seems to be
conclusive evidence of an act which, in the opinion
of the magistrates, justifies them in sending him
to gaol for four months.


Few people are aware of the alarming prevalence of
Kidney and Liver diseases, especially among those who
have arrived at or are past middle age. It is declared
on good authority that fully one-half the deaths in
this country are sither directly or indirectly the
result of Kidney or Liver disease of some sort.
A great majority of men above 40 years of age are
afflicted with some sort of affection of the Kidneys or
Bladder, and these diseases arc on the increase. Per-
sons are often seriously affected before they know of
it themselves, and thus these insidious disorders get a
good foothold before anything is done to dislodge
them.
Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes, Bright’s Disease, Incon-
tinence, Debility, Catarrh of the Bladder, Albu-
menuria, &e., are among the many forms of these
diseases. Most of these are very difficult to cure,
defying the powers oftentimes of the best physicians
obtainable, and are pronounced by many to be
incurable.
Physicians state that many forms of Kidney and
Liver disease are very difficult to detect, as in diseases
of this form oftentimes there are no symptoms of a
marked nature. This is one of the reasons why they
are so difficult to cure.
Dr. BELL’S (Kidney and Liver Bitters) is a Specific
for Kidney and Liver troubles, Bladder and Urinary
Diseases, Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes, and all of that
class of disorders.
It cures Biliousness, Headache, Jaundice, Liver
and Stomach troubles, Dyspepsia, Constipation, and
Piles.
It cures Intemperance, Nervous Diseases, General
Debility, Female Weaknesses and Excesses.
It is thoroughly reliable, highly recommended,
works promptly, relieves at once, and was never

ROWLANDS’ ODONTO is the best, purest
and most fragrant preparation for the teeth.
Health depends in a great measure upon the
soundness of the teeth and their freedom from
decay, and all dentists allow that neither washes
nor pastes can possibly be as efficacious for polish-
ing the teeth and keeping them sound and white
as a pure and non-gritty tooth powder ; such
Rowlands’ Odonto has always proved itself to be.
ROWLANDS’ EUKONIA is a beautifully pure,
delicate, and fragrant toilet powder, and has
lately been much improved. Each box has inside
the lid a certificate of purity from Dr. Redwood
Ph D., F.C.S., &o. Sold in three tints; white,
rose, and cream.
ROWDANDS’ MACASSAR OIL can now be also
had in a golden colour, which is especially suited
for fair or golden-haired children and persons.
Four sizes.
Ask any dealer in perfumery for Rowlands’
articles, of 20 Hatton Garden, London, and avoid
spurious worthless imitations.
