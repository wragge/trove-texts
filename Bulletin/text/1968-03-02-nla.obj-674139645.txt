What did Melbourne’s
biggest office building
say to Alcoa aluminium?
“Colour me Duranodic”
The A.M.P. Society’s St. James project,
under construction in Melbourne, repre-
sents the first massive order for Alcoa’s
new Duranodic 300 permanent colour
finish for aluminium. The architects were
looking for two qualities in the material
to be used for doors, windows, entrances,
shop fronts, etc.
1. Optimum resistance to weathering
and wear.
2. An attractive bronze colour.
Alcoa Duranodic'provided the ideal answer
Throughout the world, Duranodic 300
finishes are defying extremes of climate
and hard wear. Duranodic 300 finishes
permeate the metal’s structure to give
in-depth colour. They provide a rich,
hard finish which is colourfast,
permanent and lustrous.
They are a product of Alcoa research
specially developed for architectural
exterior and interior surfaces where
wear is excessive and maintenance is
difficult. The selection of Alcoa
Duranodic, immediately following its
introduction, fof Melbourne’s biggest
office building is a quick and striking
testimonial to its superior qualities.
Duranodic 300 medium bronze is but one
of the permanent colour finishes
available for aluminium from Alcoa
of Australia.

ONE MORE
WEEK
PRODUCTIVITY
IT WAS PERHAPS tactless of “TV
Times” to give the “This Day Tonight”
team a prize for productivity during
their holidays. According to the item,
two wrote a book each, another thought
about writing one, another laid down
a cellar. These are no doubt worth-
while activities, but, after all, the pro-
gram has been off the air for ten
weeks (during which time, among other
things, a Prime Minister died and
another took office) because, in that
now classic phrase, “the ABC has run
out of money.”
It is hard to think of a private firm
with finances so haphazard that it could
afford to have people employed but
unproductive for so long, and the “This
Day Tonight” team is only one small
part of the ABC affected.
RUNNING MAN
“I BEGAN, ’ Michael Pate told us in
the splendors of the Garden Court Bar
at the Wentworth in Sydney, “chasing
ambulances for the Sydney ‘Daily Tele-
graph’.” Fie had for several years been
copy boy, reporter, and radio writer.,
and had continued ever since to com-
bine writing with his work as actor
on stage and screen. He had worked
Michael Pate ...a succession of Red
Indians
often with James Mason, most notably
in “Five Fingers” (the story of Oper-
ation Cicero), and in “The Secret
Sharer,” adapted from Joseph Conrad,
under the direction of his and
Mason’s close friend John Brahm.
And Mason had often written and
co-produced. So it wasn’t surprising
that together the two men had recast
parts of Peter Yeldham’s script of “The
Age of Consent,” to be shot in the
Barrier Reef in March and April with
a complex financial backing, including
money from Columbia, Pate, Mason,
and overseas groups and from a wide
variety of Australian investors, with
Columbia release.
Pate went to Hollywood in the late
’forties when a Universal talent scout
saw him play on stage in Sydney in
“Bonaventure” as a half-wit in a
story about nuns in a storm-bound con-
vent and he was recommended to the
then boss of Universal, Australian A 1
Daff. Desperately ill from a dysenteric
complaint which involved constant
haemorrhaging, he went through physi-
cal and mental agonies with the part
tyhen “Bonaventure” was filmed (with
Claudette Colbert) as “Thunder on the
Hill.” The director had to make him
play the part according to notes in a
musical scale, and even rehearsing some
dialogue in a foreign language, to get it
right.
Later, in “All the Brothers Were
Valiant,” he had to have a fight in a
ship’s cabin with Robert Taylor. At the
end he was knocked out cold, but no
one realised until later that he had
haemorrhaged so violently from his
illness he was practically at death’s
door. Incredibly, he managed to survive
grim bouts of sickness and a particu-
larly nasty operation to appear as a
succession of Red Indians, cretinous
jailers, and grim-faced villains in scores
of movies.
He even managed to survive “The
Maze,” a mad film in which he was
the custodian of an outsize frog-like
creature, apparently the monster heir
to a fortune and locked up in an attic
room like the legendary denizen of
Glamis Castle. No doubt his pained
expression in this and other films was
due not merely to his ailment but to
the script.
But, after slogging through bad pic-
tures and some good ones for
20 years, he’s glad to be making “The
Age of Consent,” and he personally
was involved in the choice of subject,
with a 50 percent share in the property,
which he bought from Norman Lindsay
several years ago and brought to James
Mason’s attention. “Lindsay is a great
artist - a Caravaggio, a Rembrandt,”
he said with affectionate awe. “And
this story with a painter and a
beautiful girl as its subject —is Lindsay,
isn’t it?”
SEARCHING FOR SAINTS
THE PUBLISHER’S bluiß calls it “an
allegorical fairytale,” but Sydney writer
Dal Stivens’ new novel, to be published
next week, has involved him in some
devious research on a question of fact.
Titled “Three Persons Make a
Tiger,” the novel concerns a legendary
Chinese figure, the Monkey King, who
has managed to invoke the wrath of
Heaven, and to rehabilitate himself
undertakes to bring back four saints
from Australia.
After some small difficulty with the
Australian Immigration Department
(they detain him as an illegal immi-
grant), he comes across an impressive
series of what he takes to be wall scrolls
depicting the life of a knightly hero
long since dead, decides he has found
his first saint, and proceeds to the hero’s
burial place to dig him up and admin-
ister an elixir of life. Hence Mr.
Stivens’ problem.
“The scrolls are actually Sidney
Nolan’s Kelly paintings, and although
I call Kelly Jed Kell Lee in the story,
I thought I’d better be accurate about
where he is buried, because I was sure
somebody would try to catch me out
on it.”
So, in 1962, Stivens began what was
to become a lengthy and exhaustive
correspondence with the Victorian
prison authorities.
“They told me that Ned was origin-
ally buried in quicklime in the grounds
of the old Melbourne jail in Russell
Street. It was a communal grave, un-

Tactical Missiles: A report from General Dynamics
Evening the odds against
surprise attack:
Even for those who weren’t there, news-
reels of World War II and the Korean
War have made this scene familiar:
Troops are moving along a road or
field. Suddenly, an enemy plane swoops
out of the sky with machine guns and
cannons blazing. Troops scatter for
cover. A few fire at the disappearing
plane —but in vain.
Today, the foot soldier does not have
to head for cover. He has an equalizer.
Now the scene would go like this:
An enemy plane is seen in the dis-
tance. An infantryman shoulders a wea-
pon that resembles a bazooka. Through
an eyepiece he sights the plane, squeezes
a trigger and a missile whooshes out of
the tube. Seconds later, the plane ex-
plodes.
Such a weapon is now moving into
the hands of field troops. It is made by
General Dynamics and called Redeye.
It is a tactical guided missile designed
to be used by one man.
The bullet that gets
a second chance:
A bullet or shell is affected by gravity
and wind, but, by and large, once fired
it continues in the direction it was orig-
inally pointed.
A sharp eye, a steady arm and an ac-
curate gun are all you need to hit a
stationary target.
A moving object has to be “led”—the
gunner judges where the moving object
will be in a few fractions of a second
and points his bullet there.
But to “lead” an airplane traveling at
the speed of sound, miles high and able
to change its direction in a hurry, you
need a guided missile.
An effective surface-to-air weapon
must be capable of fast reaction. Its
warhead must be powerful enough to
destroy an attacking plane. Its speed
and range must be enough to reach the
attacking aircraft before the plane’s
offensive weapons can be launched
against ground troops.
But the real key is in the word guided.
The guided missile, like its evasive
target, can be steered and sometimes
steer itself. In fact, you might call a tac-
tical guided missile a “bullet that gets a
second chance.”
Let’s take a look at three produced
by General Dynamics—Terrier, Tartar
as well as Redeye—to see how some tac-
tical missiles work. All are essentially
defensive weapons.
Terrier and Tartar are supersonic,
solid-fueled missiles used by the United
States Navy. Both have what is known
as “semi-active homing” guidance. This
involves a complex of shipboard radar
and computers, combined with sensing,
computing and controlling devices with-
in the missile itself.
When search radar aboard a ship
finds an oncoming target, a radar illu-
mination beam, controlled through a
central computer, seeks out the attack-
ing plane. The radar waves reflected
from the airplane are picked up by a
sensor in the nose of the missile, which
will chase its target to intercept even if
the plane changes course several times.
Terrier:
Terrier is the bigger of the two. On its
launcher aboard a Navy cruiser, it is
about 27 feet long. The first 15 feet are
the missile proper. The second 12 con-
tain a booster rocket for propulsion.
Terrier is always ready to go. Almost
within the instant that the illumination
beam fastens on the approaching air-
craft, Terrier is triggered.
The booster blasts the missile off the
launching rack. The finder is already
receiving the reflected beam from the
target. Two small charges within the
missile have already ignited. Their burn-
ing gases turn two small turbines. One
provides power for the guidance and
control systems. The other operates a
hydraulic pump whose fluids move the
small guidance fins on the missile’s tail.
As the booster burns out and then
drops away, a sustainer rocket within
the missile proper commences firing to
continue necessary velocity to intercept.
Tartar:
Tartar is similar to Terrier, but more
compact (15 feet long and about 1,200
pounds compared to 27 feet and about
3,000 pounds for Terrier).
Its booster and sustainer are com-
bined into a single-rocket engine. When
Above: Cruiser fires a Terrier. Right: Diagram shows radar
waves sent from a ship and reflected from a plane being re-
ceived by sensor in nose of the missile. Even if the plane takes
evasive action, the missile will change course to intercept.

2. This is an actual photo of a Redeye missile (arrow) entering the jet exhaust of a
drone airplane. Immediately after this photograph was taken, the plane exploded.
1. An infantryman (above) fires a Red-
eye missile at a target drone airplane.
Tartar gets its signal, the engine gener-
ates high initial thrust to shoot aloft,
then reduces its force to provide the
long sustained velocity to reach and
chase a distant target.
Both Terrier and Tartar, in spite of
their size, can be fired repetitively al-
most as fast as a bolt-operated rifle.
Diagram shows how missile changes
course as the target changes course.
Stored in automated magazines, they
can be lifted onto a launcher, hooked
into the central computer radar control
and fired within seconds.
Ships equipped with Terrier or Tartar
can defend themselves against an armada
of attacking aircraft today far more ef-
Tartar (15 feet)
fectively than would have been possible
against a single aircraft ten years ago.
Redeye:
Redeye is designed to destroy low-flying
aircraft rather than high-altitude super-
sonic attackers. Four feet long and three
inches in diameter, it weighs only 28
pounds complete with its launcher.
Redeye’s heat-seeking guidance is
wholly self-contained. Reaction time is
little more than it takes the soldier to
lift the launcher to his shoulder, find the
attacking aircraft in the sighting scope
and squeeze the trigger. By that time,
Redeye’s infrared sensor has locked
onto the source of heat it must follow.
A small charge projects the missile
from its launching tube. At a distance
far enough to protect the soldier from
rocket blast, a fuse lights the major
rocket charge. Miniature computer cir-
cuitry within the missile directs a set of
Redeye launcher
Redeye missile (4 feet)
steering fins which enable Redeye to
change direction as necessary and chase
the target at supersonic speed until it
intercepts it.
During the long history of combat,
the advantage of surprise has almost
invariably lain with the attacker. The
modern tactical missile now more than
evens the odds for the defender. At Gen-
eral Dynamics we are already develop-
ing newer ones with still more punch.

marked to foil bodysnatchers. Then, in
1921, the prisoners were moved from
the old Melbourne jail to Pentridge,
because they were going to establish
the Emily McPherson College of
Domestic Economy on the site of the
jail.
“But the graveyard was left undis-
turbed until 1937, when they erected
the Melbourne Institute of Technology’s
Engineering School there. My corre-
spondent explained that quicklime does
not destroy bodies completely and that,
inextricably mixed, the bones in the
communal grave were dug up and
transferred to Pentridge.
“But I think I must have touched
something off somehow, because, just
after I began making inquiries, a con-
troversy started up in the Melbourne
‘Herald.’ Someone wrote a letter claim-
ing schoolboys had souvenired some
of the bones during the move, and the
man who operated the mechanical
shovel which dug them up wrote back
to say the boys hadn’t got anything and
all the bones had been transferred.
“One thing still puzzles me, though.
The prison authorities assured me the
graves were undisturbed until 1937, yet
I once read a report that Ned Kelly’s
skull has been in the basement of the
Institute of Anatomy in Canberra since
1929.”
Whether or not Ned Kelly had more
than one final resting place, Jed Kell
Lee is revived by the elixir in readi-
ness for sainthood, and to provide Mr.
Stivens’ novel with a title, which is
based on an old Chinese proverb illus-
trating the point that fiction repeated
often enough becomes fact.
“A philosopher once said to the King
of Wei, ‘Suppose somebody should tell
you a tiger is howling in the market
would you believe him?’
“The King replied, ‘No, certainly
not.’
“ ‘Suppose two people told you?’
“ ‘Then I should be sceptical.’
“ ‘And if three people told you?’
“ ‘Then I would be inclined to believe
it.’
“So saints are pretty hard to come
by, especially in Australia, but repu-
tation does count.”
END OF THE ROYAL
THE PASSING of Sydney’s Royal
Arcade is being mourned by devotees
of our more expansive and decorative
past. However, what is being regretted
is, as can be seen from this drawing
of the Royal Arcade from an 1882
“Bulletin,” a mere shadow of the elab-
orate original.
Today’s Royal Arcade is unroofed
and a not unpleasant clutter of stamp-
shops and kiosks with a renowned
Bloom’s health food shop as its centre.
Its most romantic feature now is a
faintly Italianate covered bridge link-
ing the upper floors. However, whatever
its present-day shabbiness is, it is still a
good deal more attractive than the
recently built arcades, most of which
have about the charm, proportions, and
inviting qualities of a stormwater
channel.
The Royal Arcade, running between
Pitt and George Streets, is to be de-
molished and replaced with a $2 million
development.
This virtually leaves only the Strand
Arcade as the survivor of the series
of elaborate arcades which were built
in Victorian times. The Strand has
recently been refurbished and seems in
no immediate danger of demolition.
No one has as yet exerted himself
about preserving shopping arcades
which were one of the most typical
developments of Victorian city life.
The National Trust seemed interested,
but with the financial resources of the
Trust and the vast sums involved in
redevelopment, it would, for the Trust,
have to be a matter of persuasion not
of purchase.
A more cheering matter is that Syd-
Royal Arcade in 1882
ney now has what is most certainly
the only doctor’s surgery named The
Shipwrights Arms. A doctor who re-
cently leased the old building next to
the Hero of Waterloo Hotel in The
Rocks area is restoring it, and restora-
tion will include preserving the old
pub’s name which has just been un-
covered on the facade.
According to Professor J. M. Free-
land in his “The Australian Pub,” The
Shipwrights Arms was opened by John
Clarke in 1833 in the house he had
built on the site. There were already
four pubs with the same name in The
Rocks. Clarke ran the pub until 1837
when he moved to Hunters Hill. The
Shipwrights Arms was taken over by
George Paton, who built the Garrison
Church, and who, in 1845, got a licence
for the Hero of Waterloo, which he
built next door to the Arms.

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
Secrets of
the NO
DOUBT CLINCH
YOUR CORRESPONDENT, using
the most brilliant Kim Philby tactics,
has come across a priceless secret docu-
ment. Security measures were extreme.
My agent did not want to be seen, so
he slipped into the Domain, near the
Shrine, at 3.50 a.m. He left the docu-
ment in an empty stubby by the third
sawn-off elm.
One remembered a court case in
Melbourne when an encyclopedia
salesman told how there was a script
for door-to-door sales and the worst
sin was to deviate from that script. It
began, said he: “Good morning. My
name is I’m from the promotion
department. Don’t be alarmed, this has
nothing to do with sales. We are using
this district as a test area.”
However, until now this page had
never been able to snaffle an original
undamaged script, and now one feels
for salesmen who have to learn it by
heart. It’s almost as long as “Hamlet.”
It also includes stage directions.
Here’s the scene: you can take it
that our man has triumphed, he has
announced he is from the promotional
department, and he has his captive
audience of Mr. and Mrs. Jones sitting
in the living-room.
“Now (pause) we would POSSIBLY
like to have YOU as an advertiser for
US, and we would pay you for it. Not
in actual cash by the way, but by
placing one of these BRAND-new, 13-
volume reference libraries in your
home, YOURS to keep as an advertis-
ing medium, at NO cost to you NOW
or ever (pause) (not too seriously).
What would be your reaction to that
idea?
“You don’t think there’s a catch in
it, do you, Mr. Jones? Tell me, have
you ever been given something valuable
for NOTHING before? (pause) Well
then, we’re not going to start it. I
wouldn’t insult your intelligence by say-
ing we have no catches. As a matter
of fact we have THREE catches
altogether.”
(List them firmly, ticking them on
your fingers as you do.)
“Number one: we ask a family to
give us permission to use their names
as owners of the set.
“Number two: 60 to 90 days after
a family have received their set we ask
them to send us a letter in their OWN
words telling us exactly what they
think of the set as a whole and give
us permission to use the letter in our
promotion material.
“Number three: we expect the
families we include in this program to
treat the library as if they had bought
it themselves (pause) keeping it up to
date themselves. (No pause.) These are
the three things we ask. If a family
USE this library, they are BOUND to
talk about it.
“Do you sincerely believe that yours
IS the sort of family that would use
and appreciate a library of this type
in your home over many years to
come?
“Mr. Jones (pause) Mrs. Jones?
(silently judge their answers) I see
(exclamation mark). Mr. Jones, WHY
do you think it would be valuable?
(Judge his answer before asking Mrs.
Jones the same question.) I see, in
other words, you BOTH feel that some-
thing like this would be a fine asset
in your home? (pause)
Then our script is divided into two
sections—“lst close,” “2nd close,” and
then, NO DOUBT CLINCH. Ist close,
with lots of pauses, explains that Mr.
and Mrs. Jones, to prove their sin-
cerity in this, must take the year-book
and information service for ten years
at just (pause) £lB.lO a year. The
company then, to prove its sincerity,
gives a two-volume dictionary and
eight volumes of junior classics.
Smartly switching now to dollars, Mr.
and Mrs. Jones are told they’re get-

pointing at the slot). This is actually
a conscience slot, Mrs. Jones; in case
your husband cheats a little on the
beer money he can slip it back in here
without you ever finding out about it.
“The point being, if a family keep
the date with the loose change from the
grocery money, or even less than they
spend on cigarettes a day, at the end
of the month they will find they have
£6 in this bank. If they send this to us,
then within 30 months they will have
taken care of the entire TEN-YEAR
PROGRAM of keeping the library up
to date. (Throw back to wife) What
do you think of the little bank idea,
Mrs. Jones?
“As this is a promotional program,
we would like to return the seven
and a half years’ bookkeeping savings
made this way, back to the family
and we do it this way.”
The script says that the family gets
a five-volume Book of Knowledge and
a Bible, bound with white morocco,
worth $42. “Now let me go through
the whole thing quickly once again.

orate one by one, finish with ‘. . . and
all this is for just four bob a day.’)

library will be of benefit to you and
your family?
“Two, can we rely on you to write
us that letter? Who will write? you,
Mr. Jones?
“Three, as this is only a promotional
program, we only want to create good-
will, so that at the risk of sounding
ridiculous (pick up a bank) I must ask
you: can you afford four bob a day?
“In that case there is just one other
thing I would like to do on behalf of
my company and that is this (walk
toward Mr. Jones): I would like to con-
gratulate you both and welcome you
into this program on behalf of . . .

certainly has been a pleasure to pre-
sent it to you and, frankly, I think
I have found an excellent family.
“Well, what I would like to do now
is to sit between you so that I may go
through this fairly simple enrolment
form with you minutely so that you
may be sure there is nothing on it I
haven’t told you about already. Would
you like to do this for me?” (Dim
lights. End of clinch.)
Just one thing is gravely worrying
your correspondent (Big frown) (long
pause). Why did they use the name
Jones? (Pause.) Obviously for their
promotion they have their eye on De-
tective Jones, father of the quads, Barry
Jones, the quiz king, Susan Jones of
Ansett-ANA, and Andrew Jones, MHR.
(Pregnant pause.)
Take Andrew Jones; once he has his
13-volume encyclopedia, his informa-
tion service, ten year-books, five
volumes of knowledge, his junior clas-
sics, two-volume dictionary and Bible
bound in white morocco, he’s going to
be (big smile) really something. (Ex-
clamation mark.)

-BY LISTENING
He learnt French as a child by listening to other people. You
can do exactly the same through Linguaphone. The only
difference is that you listen to the voices of distinguished
speakers and professors on Linguaphone recordings (45 r.p.m.
or tape). What they say is specially designed to help you learn
the language in a short time an incredibly short time.
Learning by Linguaphone is wonderfully easy. The process
of learning almost takes you by surprise. You find yourself
speaking the language, capturing the right accent and intonation
without any particular effort. To make sure you learn the
written language at the same time, you follow each lesson in
an illustrated textbook. Linguaphone is the finest audio-visual
way of learning a language.

What a piece
of work
is a monkey!
ON THE
MARGIN
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
ONE OF THE more reliable ways of
making a name for yourself is to be-
little the human race. Talented people
have been at it for a long time, from
Isaiah to Malcolm Muggeridge. I have
come across three of them in the past
few months.
The first is Dr. Eric Berne, author
of the book “Games People Play.”
According to this American psychiatrist,
practically all human activities work,
talk, love are in essence a series of
trivial games. His compatriots are
deeply impressed by his message that
their lives are as pointless as Gin
Rummy or Monopoly, and have bought
vast numbers of copies of his treatise.
Another belittler is Marshall
McLuhan, the Canadian expert on
“communications.” His particular tar-
get is literacy. The human species has
been spiritually crippled, he believes,
by the decadent habit of writing and
printing words. Its salvation lies in giv-
ing up reading and watching TV pro-
grams the more brainless the better.
I need hardly add that McLuhan has
found many supporters and has been
appointed to a better job, as a professor
at Fordham University.
The third knocker takes a zoological
line of attack. Dr. Desmond Morris, in
his book “The Naked Ape,” treats
human beings as a breed of hairless (or
relatively hairless) monkeys. Their most
noteworthy difference from other kinds
of monkeys, he finds, is their obsessive
interest in sex. Homo sapiens, as de-
picted by Dr. Morris, is a very libidi-
nous character indeed. His carryings-on
which the Doctor describes with an
abundance of detail compare un-
favorably with the chaste and temper-
ate domestic lives of gorillas. Some

might consider that Dr. Morris places
disproportionate emphasis on this side
of human behaviour, but his approach
has had at least one satisfactory result
—it has made him a lot of money.
Although not a professional zoologist,
I suspect that Dr. Morris’ main con-
clusion is open to dispute. Over the
years, as the parent of four children,
I have spent a fair amount of time
outside the monkey cages at Taronga
Zoo. From my observations I
have formed the opinion that the in-
mates are by no means deficient in
erotic impulses. I would not say they
are more enthusiastic than human
beings, but for steady, consistent effort
they are hard to beat.
The disparaging quality of Dr.
Morris’ book does not lie so much in
its picture of humans as oversexed
monkeys as in its indifference to human
accomplishments. Other writers, more-
over, have taken up the theme of our
simian kinship. The time has come to
speak up in defence of human beings.
Granted that monkeys are more
athletic, peaceable, and clean-minded,
there are still some things we do better
than they can. If it is fair to stress
human demerits in a book called “The
Naked Ape,” it would be fair to write
a derogatory piece on monkeys called
“The Hairy Human.”
Dr. Morris seems to regard hairi-
ness as a virtue in itself. It does keep
monkeys warm, but it is allied with
an inability to wear clothes well. I
have seen apes in a variety of cos-
tumes Eton jackets, red suits with
velvet smoking caps, striped bathing
suits but they never looked fully at
ease. A well-dressed human, whether in
formal or casual gear, has an air of
self-assurance which monkeys cannot
achieve.
I consider also though the point
is controversial that human eating
habits are superior to those of
monkeys. The chimpanzee’s skill in
peeling bananas has been much ad-
mired. Yet it, hardly compares with
the human ingenuity shown in open-
ing a tin of sardines (especially the
British kind without keys).
Monkeys can learn to dance with
some agility, but none has been able
to master advanced routines like the
fouettes in “Coppelia.” An American
taught an ape to drive his car, and
liked to startle other motorists by the
sight. He claimed that it was better-
tempered than human drivers. The
animal failed to obtain a licence, how-
ever, and could not be trusted in
dense traffic.
Personally I defy all these detract-
tors of humanity. To Dr. Berne I say
that in writing this article I am not
playing a game; I am making a serious
effort to earn a living. To Professor
McLuhan I say that I like being
literate, and would be glad if all
Professors of Electronic Communica-
tions were held incommunicado. And
to Dr. Morris I say that, although this
article is not very good, it is better
than a monkey could do.

And the
captain's name
was Emden
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
OVER IN HMS DEVONSHIRE’S
wardroom an officer called Rodney is
saying, well, actually, at the beginning
of visits like this one to Sydney there
are more men than girls at parties,
but halfway through things have a
funny knack of changing, you know,
the chaps are sort of going out with
one girl regularly, what he means to
say is, then there are more girls than
men at parties ...
And in Flag Officer Second-in-
Command Far-East Fleet’s quarters,
Rear-Admiral Edward Beckwith Ash-
more is saying he is having 20 guests
tonight, the trouble with that number
he never gets the chance to talk to them
properly; and also, pleasant though his
quarters may be he believes in
comfort, and travels with his own
record and tape players, bits of pottery
and paintings, and leaves more holes
in ship’s walls than anyone else in the
Navy pleasant though they are,
they’re undeniably cramped. So tonight
Admiral Ashmore will overflow on to
the deck under red-and-white awning
provided, he says gloomily, the wind
drops . . .
And down one of the steelplate
passages Lieutenant David Carver, who
is ship’s public-relations man, but cannot
see the point of a Press-cuttings book,
is called to report to his own office.
But that’s ridiculous. He is here.
Who is ordering him to come to his
own desk? Actually, Lieutenant
Carver has already had his share of
problems, what with GOC’s visit this
morning, no he can’t remember
GOC’s name, and one or two other
matters which he would rather not
pursue at the moment. Ah here’s
Commander Peter Russell, the Ad-
miral’s secretary, pale, spectacled, and
his white uniform knee-socks bristling
with assorted biros and propelling
pencils, saying the Admiral can spare
a few minutes now.
Six years ago when Admiral Ashmore
anchored at these shores he got away
from the Navy and toured Kings Cross
in grey flannel bags and plain shirt. He
hopes to repeat the exercise this trip,
but, the way things are going, is not too
optimistic. Well, there’s Sir Roden
Cutler’s lunch at Government House
this afternoon, followed by a look at
the Opera House, then his own party
tonight; cooked, he might say, by his
Chinese chef, Chiu Seng, without whom
he does not travel. Then he’s off to
Canberra, then Melbourne, then Sydney
and more socialising. People here are
very kind.
. . . and that’s ZEST down there,
painted that hideous green, says Lieut-
enant Carver, and this is the ship’s heli-
copter, and that’s the missile-launching
pad and, yes, the missiles are roughly
under our feet; we have to watch the
heat a bit; it’s all right, if there’s a fire
the hose goes, but if anyone happened
to be down there they’d drown, you
know, from vaporisation, you know,
they wouldn’t breathe air, their lungs
would fill with water . . . ah, yes, this
is the Admiral’s awning. Do you know,
all those social-page people have asked
to cover the Admiral’s party but he
says people who go to private parties
don’t like publicity, do they?
The wardroom is filling up for pre-
lunch drinks. It is decorated with fog-
colored cushions and floral lampshades,
dark brown woodwork, Princess Alex-
andra’s picture smiles down from one
wall, she launched Devonshire; Their
Royal Highnesses, government issue,
smile to one another over the dining
tables. Photographs of Devonshire’s
arrival in Sydney are on sale for $1
each. God, that’s ten shillings, cries a
bearded lieutenant, one of two officers
left over from a beard-growing com-
petition. Lieutenant Carver supposes
they think sets suit them. Four Ameri-
can R and R guests arrive in civilian
clothes, more Naval officers in varying
degrees of elegance. Captain Richard
Emden, the ship’s Commanding Officer,
walks in and there is an immediate
uprising of loose and fitted shorts.
“I hope,” he says, after his intro-
duction to what Lieutenant Carver is
now calling the premier news maga-
zine of Australia, “I hope you will deny
that story in Granny someone-or-other’s
column about us not dipping to the
12ft. something-or-other Sailing Squad-
ron when we came in. We didn’t dip
because we didn’t see them.” Anyway,
the Captain’s sending an officer to
apologise and invite the club’s manager
on board for a look around. That should
smooth things out, don’t you think?
Lieutenant Carver nods in complete
agreement.
Captain Emden is also enjoying his
stay in Sydney, with one reservation:
well, there should have been four
“Vogue” models at the party the other
night, but he didn’t see anyone who
could be thus described. Oh, sir, says
Lieutenant Carver, there were two in
way-out clothes . . .
Actually, Lieutenant Carver has, at
this moment, far greater needs than
meeting “Vogue” models in way-out
gear. What he’s got to buy quick in
order to join the social whirl are swim
shorts, black shoe laces, buttons, and
socks. The laundry has chewed all his
up.


Expecting too much
of New Guinea
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
WHEN Professor K. S. Inglis, the Act-
ing Vice-Chancellor of the University
of Papua and New Guinea, gave a talk
on his university last week he touched
on the kind of last-ditch prejudice
toward the university that also
represents the last-ditch prejudices
toward change of any kind that is still
to be found among some Australians in
New Guinea.
He quoted the attacks of the Port
Moresby journal “Black and White” on
the granting of an honorary degree to
Lord Casey when he declared the uni-
versity officially open last year. After
saying that giving the Governor-General
a degree was an insult to the people of
Australia because the degree would be
recognised only in Papua and New
Guinea, “Black and White” went on to
say: “Meanwhile, there will evolve
in the Territory a clique of half-baked
idiots who, by virtue of their attendance
of a university whose degrees mean
nothing, will set themselves up as in-
tellectual and social leaders of their
own people . . Money will go on being
spent on this university ... an institu-
tion which can well be compared to a
badly managed chook farm. By the
time any eggs are gathered they’ll all
be rotten.”
“Black and White’s” prejudices are
too catholic to be limited to universities.
For instance, it recently made this com-
ment on the present elections for the
House of Assembly: “After the next
elections elected membership of the
House will be increased—meaning that
there will be more morons doing their
best to bugger-up the country.”
Of course in one sense such state-
ments express more than prejudice
against Papuans and New Guineans:
they also express some of the old Aus-
tralian larrikinism that used to despise
all education as balderdash and all
politicians as crooks. Professor Inglis,
in fact, points out that scepticism about
the present readiness of Papuans and
New Guineans for university study may
tend to be concentrated among Austra-
lians in the Territory who have not
themselves had the opportunity of uni-
versity education. Even in Australia
older Australians often feel a kind of
resentment toward the educated young;
edge is given to an existing bitterness
when among those who are now better
educated than their elders are those who
until recently were regarded as lower
forms of the species.
Dangers in attitudes to the University
of Papua and New Guinea are not in
the exclusive possession of reactionaries.
There is a tendency among even those
who would see themselves as of pro-
gressive inclination to set exceptionally
high standards for Papuans and New
Guineans, standards Australians them-
selves do not reach, and when these
standards are not met to be excessively
sceptical. In an article in the latest
issue of “New Guinea,” Professor Inglis
also says that some expatriate education
at Port Moresby compares the actual
situation there with a dreamy version of
the situation in Australia or elsewhere.
He says, “At the end of 1965 I was
invited to look at some School Certifi-
cate papers in History and Geography
written by candidates in Territory High
Schools. The examiner said as he
handed them to me that I was in for
a shock. Some of them were certainly
ignorant and badly expressed and con-
fused. But I had just been reading in
Canberra some papers written by can-
didates for a public service examination
roughly equivalent to Leaving and I
felt no great bump as I travelled from
the one set of papers to the other . . .
I think the examiner had forgotten what
examination papers elsewhere were
really like! ‘These students seem to
think that Adolf Hitler and Julius
Caesar were somehow contemporaries,
living together in a timeless abstraction
called the past.’ That was said to me not
of students at the University of Papua
but by a lecturer in history at the Uni-
versity of Adelaide.”
It is no good building up ideal
models of what humans should be and
then blaming Papuans or New Guineans
for not reaching them. For example,
in looking at the standard of Members
of the House of Assembly we should
not expect to find a mixture of the
oratory of an Edmund Burke with the
organisational skill of a Robert Mc-
Namara. As legislators go, the standard
of our Members of Parliament in Aus-
tralia is not all that wonderful, yet
we get by. Even the electors in Papua
and New Guinea should be approached
with a certain self-modesty. The kinds
of “maturity” sometimes demanded of
them by Australians are of a kind that
Australians themselves cannot yet meet,
nor any other nation on earth.
It is even more important that Aus-
tralians should not judge new institu-
tions in Papua and New Guinea by the
extent to which they , provide faithful
copies of Australian institutions. After
the Political Science Summer School
in Canberra this year Minister for
Territories Barnes had something
to say on television about how, in Port
Moresby, they should imitate the “West-
minster” system of government, as we
do in Australia. For one thing, since our
system of government is federal as well
as parliamentary, Australian govern-
ment is a mixture of Westminster with
Washington. For another, Westminster
itself now doesn’t seem to be doing
much of a job anyway. There is every
sign that a Presidential system of gov-
ernment would be more apt to the prob-
lems of an independent New Guinea
as it may also later prove to be apt to-
the problems of Australia.
Sensible arbitration
or recurring nonsense?
COMMENT
BY
PETER
SAMUEL
IF THE Prime Minister were looking
through the millions of diverse factories,
offices, and Government agencies of the
Australian economy for somewhere to
start an efficiency drive he could hardly
do better than start with the outfit in
Little Bourke Street, Melbourne, called
the Arbitration Commission. He would
probably find it needed some new staff.
I suppose the Arbitration Commis-
sioners have some sort of judicial im-
munity against losing their jobs, so such
simple remedies are not immediately
practicable. But the Government really
must do something about it, to limit
the havoc it wreaks. Its so-called work-
value cases seem destined to produce
unprecedented confusion, litigation, in-
flation pressures, and industrial strife.
Last week’s second-stab metal-trades de-
cision is just as bewildering as the first.
It is hard to find anything to be said
in its favor from whichever viewpoint
you look at it.
The first difficulty is the lack of any
argument in support of the decision,
“Because this is an essentially practical
decision in which we have striven to
reach common ground in a practical
way, we will not follow the usual prac-
tice of publishing detailed reasons for
arriving at this common decision,” the
Commission said. That prompts the
question: why cannot practical decisions
be explained? It prompts the aside that
previous decisions in which there has
been an attempt at explanation were
presumably not practical, and it
prompts the observation that in not one
work-value case has the Commission
given reasons.
The truth is that meaningful criteria
for determining work-value have never
been determined. An economist asked
to find some meaning in the term will
say that there is none, beyond the con-
cept of “marginal productivity”
(roughly the addition to revenues
achieved by the employment of an extra
man), and that is the same as market

rates of pay. But, rather than look
at work-value from the side of value of
output, the Arbitration Commission tries
to determine it from the irrelevant side
of the costs or inputs of the worker (his
length of training, the nastiness of the
job, the mental strain, etc.). Because
the Commission’s theory has never been
developed systematically, it gives no
way of quantifying or relating various
criteria chosen, so after the Commission
has done its detailed study of the work
and workers it is investigating it is no
better off than when it started. It
still has to pluck a figure from the air,
and it will have to go on doing this
unless it can work out what it means
by work-value. No one else can.
The second aspect of the Commis-
sion’s second-stab judgment is the
astonishing naivety it reveals when it
states its surprise that absorption of
over-award payments had not occurred.
Except in the case of disputes between
extraordinarily weak unions and extra-
ordinarily cohesive employers (the
journalists’ case is an example) over-
award payments are almost never ab-
sorbed.
The Commission has set an astonish-
ing precedent with its suggestion that
full increases must generally be paid
and over-award payments maintained
in the second metal trades’ judgment.
The function of the Commission in the
past has always been the determination
of minimum rates of pay, and the
Commission itself has often emphatic-
ally declared this. Are we now moving
to the extraordinary concept of personal
award rates where a worker can claim
the support of the Commission for, say r
above the minimum just because that
was the amount he had been able to
get from his employer before the award
was raised? The employers would soon
want this arbitration on over-award
payments reciprocal so that maximum
wages were determined by the Com-
mission.
Of course, the final criticism of the
second-stab metal trades judgment is
that they tried to have it both ways.
While rejecting the insertion of an ab-
sorption-is-OK clause in the award and
saying that there should be no absorp-
tion and that over-award payments
should be maintained it left its loophole:
“But we recognise the possibility of the
odd case where some absorption is in-
escapable.”
The Commission obviously realises
the danger of setting a precedent in its
general insistence on non-absorption, so’
it leaves a loophole. Through that
loophole every hard-pressed ' machine-
shop owner will try to take his case for
absorption. As the President of the
Metal Trades’ Association put it: “The
Commission is leaving it to employers
and the unions to slog it out.”
Unless the Government does some-
thing about the Commission this sort of
nonsense is going to recur every few
months over the next three or four
years as each union in the country
applies to have its work valued by this
strange crew of amateur valuers and
inept arbitrators.


AUSTRALIA
The Member for Higgins
announces his team
Prime Minister Gorton at the pre-announcement Cabinet
meeting last Friday
Ministers Bury, Hulme, and Fairhall were sure of places in the
new Cabinet
MR. GORTON’S team is very much a
compromise. He foreshadowed his
caution at the weekend by saying there
would be no major reshuffle, neatly spik-
ing expectations of a clean sweep after
several of his proposals ran into stiff
opposition at Friday’s Cabinet meeting
in Melbourne. It was at this meeting
that he made his compromises.
Rebel Senator Reg Wright, who has
often crossed the floor to vote with the
Opposition, was given the most lowly
of all portfolios—the Department of
Works, which is almost purely adminis-
trative in its ministerial workload. Gor-
ton had wanted Wright as his successor
to the position of Leader of the Govern-
ment in the Senate, soon if not immedi-
ately, but he was told that this would
be “rewarding disloyalty.”
He backed down on that one and is
now doubtful about his ability to get
Wright through to replace Senator An-
derson when he retires. But that fire-
ball Mr. W. C. Wentworth (with whom
the P.M, went “into smoke” recently)
was successfully got into the Ministry
despite the intense opposition of the
more stodgy members of Cabinet who
describe him as erratic and irresponsible.
Mr.. McEwen was almost as solid as a
brick wall with Mr. Gorton, refusing
to shift any of his weaker men. The
figure of Mr. Barnes will still be seen
greeting the natives in New Guinea,
speaking paternally to them of the need
to keep their options open. He does have
the Northern Territory taken from his
grasp, but since it has gone to his young
colleague Mr. P. Nixon, along with the
Interior Portfolio, it has not left the
hands of the Country Party.
Silvertail Howson and PR man
Chipp, both of whom bungled their port-
folios and led the Snedden-for-PM cam-
paign (the “wavelength of the era”
phrase was Chipp’s), are dropped. Few
members of Cabinet objected.
Three of the four new members of
the Ministry have some reputation for
administrative dash and imagination.
Scott, in the Department of Customs,
is a long-service man who came from
the right State, but there is no doubt
about the enterprise of Wentworth
and Wright; and Lynch, a former
management consultant, is the Liberal
Party’s systems man. He has been
given Army because if the Department
is. to be expanded rapidly and efficiently,
then it needs a man with organisational
ability.
The appointment of Lynch, a
Catholic, will do something to under-
mine the argument that the Liberal
Party is Protestant in orientation. He
was campaigned against so vigorously
by the Victorian Liberal machine and
the Victorian Liberal establishment that
he only just got the preselection at the
last poll.
As Prime Minister, Mr. Gorton is
obviously not going to have the same
friendly relations with his external
party machine that Holt had by flatter-
ing them, and Menzies simply by being
Menzies. Gorton is still for them
something of an upstart. Even the mild
reforms he has introduced will cause
disquiet.
Mr. Gorton is not hurrying himself
greatly. His announcement of a new
Ministry was not accompained as ex-
pected, by changes in public service
lines of responsibility. And there was
no change in departmental heads.
It was generally understood in Can-
berra last week that Mr. Gorton had
decided to send his departmental head,
Sir John Bunting, off to another post
and replace him with Mr. Hewitt, of
the Universities Commission, renowned
for his bluntness of manner and sharp-
ness of mind and tongue, and long Mr.
Gorton’s favorite public servant.
The present incumbent, Sir John
Bunting, was a typical Menzies appoint-
ment, the epitome of the cautious ad-
ministrator. Devoting himself to detail
and routine, always the mediator, hand-
ling paper well, the model of discretion,
he initiated nothing. Gorton wants
Hewitt and Mr. Kenneth Jones of the
Department of Education, and a separ-
ate Cabinet Secretariat, but he has had
to compromise on these desires for the
time being. There were, last week,
suggestions that Sir Alan Westerman,
his Department of Trade and Industry
falling apart at the top through resigna-
tions, had had enough of it and was
off to Japan as Ambassador, opening the
way for Bunting. But there seems to
have been a hitch in that scheme.
Gorton also had to compromise in
the matter of age. Three of his new
Ministers are in their 60s and have
been in Parliament since 1949, almost
deserving their positions on time served.
Lynch is the lone new representative of
a younger generation of Liberals. Gor-
ton would have liked to get people like
Mr. Andrew A. Peacock, Kevin Cairns,
and Tom Hughes into his Ministry, but
he could not bring himself to swing his
axe so wildly as to make room for them
at this stage.


The Task Force
A more comprehensive role
THE GOVERNMENT seems to be
losing its argument with the Press and
Mr. Whitlam over whether it has
changed its policy on troop deployment
in Vietnam. For it now looks as if
policy is changing, whether the Govern-
ment has intended it or not.
The TET offensive of the Commun-
ists on towns and cities has seen two of
the three Australian battalions out of
Phuoc Tuy for a month, to cover the
Bien Hoa air base. It also seems that
two of the three battalions will gener-
ally be deployed out of the province un-
less the Communists substantially rein-
force there.
At present in Phuoc Tuy the Com-
munists have a provincial mobile bat-
talion (D 445) of about 400 very tough
and experienced troops, split into
platoons and squads roaming in several
parts of the province, a Chau Due dis-
trict company of about 100, and
between 50 and 300 guerillas of varying
activeness. All the Viet Cong main
force troops of the Fifth Division are
out of the province. The 275 VC regi-
ment disappeared in September-
October last year, and the 274 around
the New Year. Evidently they moved
to the deep base area of Zone D,
beyond Bien Hoa air base and closer to
the Cambodian border.
The Communist deployment of six
main force battalions out of the
province is being given as the justifica-
tion for long-ranging Australian opera-
tions outside Phuoc Tuy. But these leave
only a small Australian force in the pro-
vince, a large proportion of which will
always be tied up in defending the
Task Force base at Nui Dat and the
horseshoe position to the south, or else
in resting from operations. Hardly more
than two or three companies will be
available at any one time for patrolling
and ambushing and manning check-
points in the province.
This means that the number of
troops available for intensive pacifica-
tion work in the Australian tactical
area of responsibility in Phuoc Tuy
will be much reduced. Cordons and
searches of villages to pick up VC in
villages, and to gather intelligence on
their activities and check for arms
caches, are needed frequently if guerilla
activity is to be kept down. In addi-
tion, control over the movement of
people and strategically important
material like food and drugs requires
continual patrolling, wire barriers, and
checkpoints.
It is doubtful whether this sort of
anti-guerilla work can be maintained
at a high enough pitch if two-battalion
out-of-province operations become
common. There simply will not be the
necessary number of troops left be-
hind.
Whether policy has changed in the
direction of American-style large-scale
mobile operations, and away from
counter-insurgency, remains to be seen.
But in statements issuing from the
Defence Department there seems to be
the indication of a major change in
policy. In his last statement on the sub-
ject, Defence Minister Fairhall said:
“The major military task of the Austra-
lian force is directed against enemy
main force units to prevent their launch-
ing major attacks on population centres
and important installations.” The
Government has never published the
A Task Force soldier strings wire in
the Bien Hoa jungle
Task Force on move,
also in Bien Hoa
brief to the Commanding Officer when
the Task Force was first sent to Phuoc
Tuy, but it is understood to have said
that his job was to help the local
government authorities restore the
piovince to their control by providing
the population and officials with pro-
tection against the Viet Cong.
In other words, the Australian mili-
tary task was to be far more compre-
hensive than Mr. Fairhall’s new
definition of it. The doctrine on which
comprehensive counter-insurgency was
based was largely devised by Colonel
Ted Serong (founder of Canungra, now
a Westmoreland aide) and Brigadier
Stuart Graham (relieved of his com-
mand of the Task Force at Christmas,
now at Northern Command). Their
doctrine dictates a concentration of
effort of separating the Communists
from the people by a variety of counter-
insurgency control techniques, and
keeping them away by patrolling and
an intense searching for supply caches
on which they depend for movement.
Direct operations against the main
force units are given low priority be-
cause it is reckoned that they are
generally less productive than smaller
scale work among the villages.
The Army’s counter-insurgency men
would argue that the main force in
a war like Vietnam will become con-
stantly less aggressive as they have to
spend their energies in replacing food
and supplies, which they used to get
from the population, from already
strained supply lines from North Viet-
nam or Cambodia; and without the
infrastructure in the villages to fight
for they will lose morale and wither
through defections. To encourage
defections, tiny bands of three or four
Special Air Service bravados would be
dropped into the mainforce jungle base
areas to chuck grenades or place booby
traps, or sets of claymore mines
ambushes (then run for their lives to
a waiting helicopter), but the main-
body of troops would not. generally be
sen t after the Communist regiments
ou t in the bush. That, it was argued,
was generally unproductive, because of
the Communists’ ability to disperse,
and dangerous because of the possi-
bility of big ambushes and extensive
booby traps systems,
Until about November last year, this
was the doctrine which generally pre-
vailed in planning Australian opera-
tions. It looks as though it may be
going by the board, and that the Aus-
tralians are adopting American fire-
power-plus-mobility doctrines.


Voyager Commission
Further questions
THE DEBATE IN Federal Parliament
which will follow the release of the
report of the second Voyager Royal
Commission is sure to be lively. Enough
questions seem left unanswered or only
partly answered for Opposition mem-
bers to make something of it, especially
since Liberal back-benchers had fought
so hard against ministerial indifference
toward setting up a second Commission.
When it was finally constituted last
year, the Commission sat for 85 days
at a total estimated cost of around
$600,000, with these general terms of
reference:
1. Whether any of the allegations
made by Lieut-Commander Cabban re-
garding the drinking habits and sea-
manship of Captain D. H. Stevens were
true, and, being true, established that
Captain Stevens was unfit to retain
command of HMAS Voyager?
2. If it is found in answer to Ques-
tion 1 that Captain Stevens was unfit to
retain command of HMAS Voyager:
(a) Did the Naval Board know, or
ought they have known, of such unfit-
ness to retain command, and were they
at fault in failing to relieve him of
command?
(b) Should the findings made in the
report of the Royal Commission relating
to the loss of HMAS Voyager be varied,
and, if so, in what respect?
3. Whether the allegations in the
document by Lieut-Commander Cab-
ban disclosed evidence which was avail-
able to counsel assisting the Royal Com-
mission and was improperly withheld
from the Royal Commission?
Perhaps one of the most debatable
items in the second Commission’s report
is that referring to Captain Stevens’
“horseplay” at his birthday party
aboard Voyager in Tokyo in 1963, when
he “bounded along on his hands and
knees toward the dinner table” after
having “consumed a substantial quan-
tity of alcohol during the day” and,
though having only one drink at the
dinner, was later “suffering from
stomach pains of a severe nature” due
to his ulcer.
This the second Commission did not
regard “as a matter for any grave cen-
sure at all,” although during its hear-
ings the Flag Officer in Command,
Australian Fleet, Rear-Admiral Peek,
in reply to a hypothesis outlining just
suck events, had said, “I would allow
a court-martial to adjudicate on the
matter” of whether such a captain
should be relieved of his command.
The possibility which might occur to
a bystander is that an officer might
come aboard his ship mildly intoxica-
ted, if not actually “drunk,” and if, for
instance, a fire broke out, he might
be able to think and act clearly
if not further affected by a health con-
dition which had been successfully con-
cealed from the Naval Board.
How Captain Stevens managed to
conceal the effects of his ulcer from
the Board for so long, although it seems
this was more or less common know-
ledge among some of his fellow officers,
is a question not adequately covered
in the findings. It raises a further
general question as to whether or not
the Commission was too easily in-
fluenced by normal traditions of Ser-
vice fellowship traditions which, in
this instance, seem to vie with regula-
tions as to drinking which every airline
pilot, and for that matter anyone who
drives a car, has to observe.
The average motorist, reading the
Commission’s report, might be forgiven
for thinking that it dismisses too airily
the Navy’s clubby attitudes toward its
officers’ drinking on board when others’
lives are at risk, which is always.
N.S.W. elections
No Labor comfort
IT SHOWED HOW much its 25 years
of office in N.S.W. (1940-65) had
hardened the arteries of the N.S.W.
Labor Party that the 'best that its leader,
Mr. Renshaw, could do to excuse his
defeat at last Saturday’s election was to
blame changes in the electoral boun-
daries for the victory of the Askin
Government.
In fact, the boundary changes made
under Mr. Askin’s first Government
were extremely moderate, not even fully
correcting the pro-Labor bias that had
been built into the boundaries during
the preceding quarter century. The
measure of their moderation was that
only a one percent swing in Labor’s
favor last Saturday would have won
them the Government with a minority
of votes. There is no doubt that, in the
manner of State politics, the boun-
daries will now change much more to
the advantage of the Liberal-Country
Party coalition, with an increase in
country seats. Labor is going to find
the coalition much harder to dig Gut
next time.
Mr. Renshaw’s whinge about the
boundaries—as if it were unfair that
they did not follow the tradition of
strongly favoring Labor was merely
the last movement in a humdrum
Labor campaign which suggested that
LabOr had learned nothing in the first
three years of its exile. As an Opposi-
tion, Labor had left almost all ot the
running to the Government so that
when Mr. Renshaw came in at the end
with a flurry of old-fashioned promises
it is doubtful if most of the voters even
knew that the promises had been made.
With no preceding groundwork, they
did not register.
In making his promises, Mr. Ren-
shaw was said to have been impressed
by the something-for-everyone tech-
niques that Mr. Askin had used in the
1965 election, but Mr. Renshaw may
have misunderstood what Mr. Askin’s
long list of promises really amounted
to. The Askin' promises had not been
promises in the old-fashioned sense;
they were a kind of detailed dramatisa-
tion of the inadequacies of Labor Gov-
ernment. People wanted to vote the
1965 Labor Government out, and Mr.
Askin’s promises fitted in with some-
thing they already had in their minds.
Mr. Renshaw’s Opposition had not pro-
vided any impetus for the electorate to
want to vote out the Askin Govern-
ment, so that his promises just seemed
politician’s vote-getting blarney. In any
case, Mr. Askin did manage to offer
something to almost every significant
section of the community: Labor’s
imagination, or its staff work, was not
so thorough.
Mr. Whitlam cannot find one crumb
of comfort in the voting figures. On
the face of it they show a shift of a few
decimal points in Labor’s favor, but if
allowances are made for uncontested
seats in both elections and several other
minor factors are taken into account,
it looks more likely now that Labor’s
support dropped by somewhere between
one to two percent compared with the
1965 election. It might be only two
percent above the disastrous figure to
which it dropped in the last Federal
election, the Calwell debacle of 1966.

Cultural relations
Room for growth
THE SIX WEEKS, ten countries
Asian tour of the Australian Ballet
Company (performing in Bangkok this
week, fresh from Kuala Lumpur)
represents the biggest cultural export
Australia has yet made to Asia. There
is likely to be more of it.
Knowing that cultural relations are
recognised by many countries as a most
effective way of projecting a national
image, creating respect and interest,
the External Affairs Department last
year set up a functional section for
cultural relations. Staffed by some
“culture vultures” who do have a genu-
ine interest in the intrinsic value of
cultural exchange, the section is inter-
ested in maximising the impact of
cultural activities in areas of foreign-
policy importance to Australia.
The first major project it sponsored
was the Asian tour of “the Tintookies”
puppeteers. Armed with taped com-
mentaries in the languages of the
countries they visited, $BO,OOO of
Government money and External
Affairs assistance with travel bookings
Leaving fur the Ballet Company’s Asian tour, Marilyn Jones, Sir Robert Helpmann,
and. Barbara Chambers
and administrative arrangements, the
Tintookies visited a dozen Asian
countries, and were seen by over
100,000 people. They made a great
impact in Burma, of all places, prob-
ably doing more to project Australia’s
image in that hermit country than any-
thing before.
The Depaument of External Affairs
is particularly interested in further
tours of Asia. It already has a cultural
attache in Tokyo and has presented
books to many Japanese university
libraries. And sent Hal Porter to lec-
ture on Australian literature. Soon an
Australian woman, under External
Affairs auspices, is going to lecture to
Japanese audiences on of all things
flower arranging.
The Australian Government is sup-
porting a Korean proposal for a cul-
tural centre sponsored by ASPAC to
be situated in Seoul. Its first project
will be to establish a panel of trans-
lators to make available some of the
literature of the region in the languages
on the nine member countries. Patrick
White may be able to look forward to
editions in Malay, Korean, Filipino,
and Thai?
Exhibitions of painting are another
way of communicating culturally, and
in Pakistan now there is an Australian
art collection on tour, with 34 paint-
ings by such artists as Blackman, Boyd,
Coburn, Perceval, Tucker, and Wil-
liams. In New Zealand, 40 pieces of
sculpture are on show.
The tour of the Australian Ballet
Company was initiated by the Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust but has been
thoroughly pushed through by the
External Affairs Department, which is
guaranteeing any losses up to $lBO,OOO.
Their experience in the mechanics of in-
ternational movement are essential if a
band of happy-go-lucky artists are to
get their visas in time, book the right
halls, get their props through Customs,
and overcome all the other numerous
fiddling pre-requisites to a successful
tour.
One of the problems of Australian
cultural groups like the Ballet Com-
pany, and for that matter the sym-
phony orchestras, is that Australia it-
self does not provide the year-round
audiences necessary for financial via-
bility. The Commonwealth Govern-
ment is already subsidising their activi-
ties, through the Elizabeth Theatre
T rust, to the tune of close on a million
dollars a year. It is therefore logical
to provide them with work and con-
tinuity by sending them on overseas
tours for two or three months a year.
But if the whole program is to be
better co-ordinated, then it would look
as though some administrative re-
arrangements are needed. Perhaps the
half dozen odd agencies at present
projecting Australian “culture” over-
seas need to be brought under one roof
either under External Affairs or
even possibly under a Ministry for Cul-
tural Affairs, if that doesn’t sound too
Orwellian.
At present, External Affairs has a
section of half a dozen officers who try
to ease the administrative problems of
Australian cultural groups going on
tour, dispensing limited subsidies on
occasions and, via posts overseas, try-
ing to get books on Australia distribu-
ted to libraries. The News and In-
formation Bureau, which operates under
the Department of Territories, has a
budget of s2£ million and a staff of
500, and a good proportion of its work
might be termed cultural relations. So
is a lot of Immigration Department
publicity-seeking on behalf of Australia.
Also, there is the Department of
Education and Science, publishing the
journal “Hemisphere,” intended to
promote Asian-Australian understand-
ing and giving scholarships. Radio Aus-
tralia and the National Film Board
make their contributions, finally, in
“promoting the arts.” And in arranging
Australian participation in expositions
like Montreal’s last year and Osaka’s
in 1970, the Prime Minister’s Depart-
ment makes a contribution to Austra-
lia’s cultural impact overseas.
No one in Government has really
ever tried to sort all this out and add
it up, but our guestimate is that Aus-
tralian taxpayers are putting up about
$5 million a year in support of cul-
tural promotion overseas. This means
that at present we spend no more than
Singapore.
Cambodians borders
Important outcome
“YOUR HIGHNESS, in getting recog-
nition of your borders, you seem to
have achieved some sort of diplomatic
coup. I have been round long enough
to know that there is usually some
give and take. What has Australia
gained from your country?” To this
final question at his Press conference
in Canberra last week, Cambodian
Foreign Minister Prince Norodom
Phurissara, smiled and said simply.
“Our friendship.”
Cambodian friendship was, until
September last year, one of the Aus-
tralian Government’s most prized
diplomatic assets. But frozen by a
refusal to recognise Cambodian borders
where they were disputed by neighbors,

and a clash over the Cambodian
Government acting as intermediary in
sending Monash student money to the
Viet Cong, it was not easily regained.
It took an unprecedented about-face by
the Australian Government. Canberra
had beforehand gone out of its way to
underline its non-recognition of Cam-
bodian border claims, but last week’s
joint Phurissara-Hasluck statement said
that “The Australian Government in
conformity with the United Nations
Charter, recognises and respects the
territorial integrity of the Kingdom of
Cambodia within its present frontiers.”
Australian External Affairs officials
refuse to comment on whether this
implies a recognition of Cambodian
claims to areas occupied by South
Vietnam, but Prince Phurissara said he
understood Australia had agreed to
recognise the frontiers as stipulated by
the Cambodian Government: “We
think that your recognition gives us
moral and legal support.” He went
further, saying that in the case of an
emergency in the form of aggression
from outside, his Government might
call for troops from friendly countries.
Quickly he was asked, “Would you
make that call on Australia?” to which
he replied: “I will if necessary.” But
Cambodia could handle insurgency
itself.
After the Press conference, there
were jokes of a war between Thailand
and Cambodia flaring up over a temple
in the disputed border area, with both
countries asking Australia for troops:
Thailand under SEATO and Cambodia
because of Australia’s recognition of
its border claims. Journalists rushed to
telephone the Thai and Vietnamese em-
bassies to get their reaction to the
situation. But both were being properly
diplomatic.
The Vietnamese have more important
matters on their minds than any dis-
putes with Cambodia over off-shore
islands, and the Thais point out that
SEATO implies no automatic commit-
ment to meet calls for assistance. Also
that SEATO was most unlikely to be
invoked in relation to a border dis-
pute with Cambodia since it was pri-
marily designed as a counter to Com-
munist aggression. And in any case the
Thai Government was itself keen to
improve relations with Cambodia, and
was hopeful there would be no armed
clashes.
Of greatest long-term interest were
Prince Phurissara’s comments on the
problem of Viet Cong incursions into
Cambodia and use of the border regions
of his country as a sanctuary for fight-
ing the Vietnam war. Were the Russians
likely to lift their veto on his country’s
request for a more effective Inter-
national Control Commission force to
supervise his borders?” We don’t think
the Russians will change their mind, but
to keep proof of our goodwill we (keep)
asking for a strengthening of the ICC.”
It was put to him that if his Govern-
ment was convinced the Russians would
continue to block every proposal for
strengthening and making effective the
ICC, why did it not try to make alter-
native international arrangements for
assistance in policing its borders? Be-
cause the Russians would block any
such attempt at effective supervision
and, of course, left unsaid was the point
that to go to Western countries alone
for assistance in border policing would
be tantamount to abandoning Cam-
bodian neutrality.
In any case, from Australia’s point of
view the most important outcome of the
talks was that they signalled a complete
restoration of Australia’s special rela-
tionship with Cambodia. Thailand and
South Vietnam had been prevailed upon
to accept Australian recognition of their
difficult neighbor’s border claims in the
interests of keeping lines open to Phnom
Prince Norodom Phurissara and PM
Gorton last week
Penh, where Australia represents Saigon
and the United States.
With relations fully restored, the
modest level of economic aid could be
stepped up, and three new projects
were announced. Mr. Hasluck announc-
ed that contracts had been let for a
third consignment of 120 irrigation
pumps worth $260,000, and that con-
tracts would soon be let for six flood
control pumps costing $285,000 for a
project to protect the low-lying capital
city. He also promised a Snowy Moun-
tains team to finish design work on a
Mekong project dam to cost $U.5.33
million.
Australia would benefit by cultural
exchange. Prince Phurissara announced
at the Press conference that the Royal
Ballet of Cambodia, one of the most
famous in the world, would visit Aus-
tralia. There have been requests that
it appear at the Adelaide Festival of
Arts in 1970.


OVERSEAS
A slow burn ready to
flare up in Manila
From Harvey Stockwin
IT WAS SCARCELY noticed in the
world’s Press, preoccupied as it was
with the attack on the American Em-
bassy, that the Saigon offensive
launched by the Viet Cong during the
Tet holiday also saw the destruction
of the Philippines Ambassador’s resi-
dence. Needless to say, the Manila Press
was less concerned with helicopters
unable to zero in on Ambassador
Bunker’s workplace than they were
with Ambassador Salceda being escorted
to safety by three Filipino soldiers
later decorated his house made “un-
livable” and his cars destroyed.
The story by itself neatly illustrates
Manila’s tendency toward isolation from
the outside world (including the rest of
the Philippines) and equally the reverse.
What happened subsequently high-
lighted the fact that Filipino-American
relations are not the happy filial part-
nership the outside world frequently
imagines thepi to be.
Briefly, in the wake of the residency’s
demolition a Bill was tabled in Manila
by Congressman Amante authorising
the dispatch of two combat battalions
to Vietnam in addition, that is, to the
PHILCAG Civic Action Battalion
already there. To the complete con-
trary, Congressman Mitra hinted
strongly, while one or two newspaper
columnists, notably J. V. Cruz, openly
suggested, that such hawk-like manifes-
tations were uncalled for since there
was no knowing the Viet Cong did the
demolishing, and very likely the CIA
did the job in order to get the two
battalions.
At this, battle was joined as it
is every day on every conceivable
issue—to give the right Filipino per-
spective. Those supporting Amante
applied the doctrines of Anti-Com-
munism while those behind Mitra
applied the dogmas of Anti-Ameri-
canism. A Congressional investigation
into whether the Viet Cong intention-
ally carried out the attack or not was
suggested and may eventuate.
Wittily one non-partisan columnist
suggested the Viet Cong might not
be a forthcoming source and the Con-
gressmen, like the Foreign Office,
would eventually get their information
from the Americans.
Inevitably the debate escalated into
“Should we or should we not support
the U.S. in Vietnam?” Congressman
Enverga (who last year shocked some
Manila circles by wining and dining
communist diplomats in Washington
without inviting any American
officials) called for the removal of
United States bases, while Foreign
Secretary Ramos stoutly defended their
desirability. The newspapers were
filled with lists of Filipino civilians
reported safe many are in Vietnam
on construction works for U.S. firms
as well as the usual war reports. The
safety of the PHILCAG was well can-
vassed, while the fact that South Viet-
namese soldiers pilfered the instruments
and belongings of Filipino doctors and
nurses hard at work helping the
wounded and the dying was well
reported.
Meanwhile, President Marcos was at
pains to put himself above hll the
“politico guerilla warfare,” and must
have been thanking his intuition for
making this possible. Concluding his
ASEAN tour a little before the attack,
he had stated firmly at Manila air-
port that the Filipino commitment to
Vietnam would be maintained but not
increased.
While Marcos shrewdly, if not too
convincingly, tried during the Vietnam
crisis to convey an image of a Filipino
Government making its own inde-
pendent assessment of the situation (one
commentator was nearer the mark when
suggesting the Asian desk at the Foreign
Office was in dire need of strengthen-
ing), at the same time he authorised the
Bill for the next PHILCAG appropria-
tion and sent it to Congress for
approval.
No doubt it will be passed. But
despite his apparent unconcern Marcos
may well be worried. So far he has
hitched his wagon to the Filipino-
American alliance.
“Marcos may well be the last of the
intimately pro-American Presidents,” 1
said one top American observer to me
in Manila recently, and as if to under-
line his comment there is already specu-
lation that Marcos may unhitch his
wagon after he is re-elected next year.
The main point now is, of course, that
his re-election chances might well be
affected, seriously, if America fails in
or withdraws from Vietnam. During
the election last year the only Liberal
Senator, Victor Benigno Acuino, jun.,
made considerable play with the Viet-
nam issue on the grounds that it is
civil war in the first place and the
Philippines needs all the Civic Action
it can provide for itself in the second.
Nacioncalista candidates such as Ex-
Vice - President now Senator Pelaez
responded effectively in “the house is
on fire, don’t you help put it out?”
tradition. PHILCAG is only doing
just that, not lighting any fires itself.
But all the same it won’t make things
Even though he is sending two more battalions to Vietnam, Philippines President
Marcos may unhitch his wagon from the unpopular American alliance


easier for Marcos if the fire is not
properly extinguished.
Above and beyond such calculations
the fact is, as Raul Manglapus points
out so eloquently, that the Philippines
is itself alight and doing a slow
burn in relation to America at the
same time. Marcos is in the tenuous
political position of defending the
proposition that old friends are the
best tenuous because the number
of those who want to jettison the
“special relationship” is increasing.
The feeling that the United States
has paid more attention to ex-enemies
such as Japan than to old friends such
as the Philippines; the belief that
America has got more out of the
Philippines than vice versa and has
taken Filipino friendship for granted;
the fact that ulterior motives are
readily ascribed to American actions
whereas previously they were not (that
the CIA had enough time to attack
the Residence may seem unbelievable
in Melbourne. In Manila the fact is
it can be believed); the converse fact
that what passed for nationalist asser-
tion elsewhere in Asia is dubbed anti-
Americanism in the Philippines; these
are but four of many manifestations
which suggest the correctness of a
leading Filipino historian’s conclusion.
“Deteriorating relations with America
are almost inevitable—l am sure anti-
Americanism will increase in future,”
he told me.
Crucially, in the 20 years since inde-
pendence, relations with America have
been closer than one would expect them
to have been, while today international
pressures force them closer than they
ought to be. To the problem of
Filipino instability is added the uncer-
tainty of Filipinos concerning their
national indentity. While Vietnam
events make Thais wonder how in
future they will express their identity,
these events only illustrate that Fili-
pinos have yet to find any agreement —
except the continual disagreements of
Manila politicking.
In a confused and murky situation
one certainty emerges. Were Austra-
lian-Filipino relations themselves less
indistinct there would be an oppor-
tunity for Canberra to be both a closer
friend of the Philippines and a better
ally of America.
Vietnam
What's Charley
really cooking up?
IS KHE SANH America’s Dien Bien
Phu? The question seems less relevant
in Da Nang than it does to the outside
world. American commanders in the
I Corps area are not so obsessed with
the fate of Khe Sanh as many outsiders
are. The reason is that the Tet offen-
sive and its aftermath are showing the
beleaguered Marine garrison in Khe
Sanh to be one part only of a much
larger communist plan for getting con-
trol of Quang Tri and Thua Thien,
South Vietnam’s two northernmost
provinces.
In these two provinces the National
Liberation Front has created “people’s
revolutionary committees.” These com-
mittees are designed to assume the
functions of an administration after the
South Vietnamese Government organs
have been “wiped out at all levels.”
While there is a good deal of revolu-
tionary hot air in all this, it is a pointer
that cannot be ignored—especially by
those who have seen the actual con-
dition of these two provinces.
Although the Thua Thien people’s
revolutionary committee may not stand
for much, neither, at the moment, does
the Saigon Government’s administration
in the province. There are persistent
and circumstantial reports of some pro-
vincial officials and army officers going
over to the NLF. But most of the 2000
civil servants in these provinces are
simply untracable. According to the
province chief 300 of them have been
executed, but hard proof is lacking. A
great many more are likely to have
been ideologically softened up or just
plain frightened by the Communists.
The underpinning provided by Ameri-
can advisers has also gone, since most
of these advisers have been either killed
or kidnapped.
The countryside of both provinces,
except where it is actually occupied
by Government or American troops, has
almost certainly returned to insecurity
or even to Viet Cong control. In
Quang Tri, half the “revolutionary de-
velopment” teams returned to the towns
when the Communists attacked. The
other half stayed on, and nobody yet
knows what has happened to them. The
prize development areas around Hue
in Thua Thien province appear to have
been abandoned since the South Viet-
namese regiment, providing security for
them, had to move back to defend the
city itself.
Although some pessimists fear that
other provinces might be in a similar
fix the Viet Cong have so far formally
claimed to have “completely liberated”
the “entire countryside” in Quang Tri
and Thua Thien only. And it is only
Hue that has produced a passably con-
vincing pro-Viet Cong political group-
ing made up largely of veterans of
the 1966 Buddhist-led demonstrations
against the Government with some-
thing like political roots, particularly
among intellectuals. But there is no
solid evidence here or elsewhere that
the militant monks themselves have
come out actively for the Viet Cong.
Where the Viet Cong go next is not
clear and must largely depend on how
quickly they can recover from their
defeat in Hue, finally wrested from
North Vietnamese control on Sunday,
after some of the bloodiest fighting of
the entire war. The Communists
Old Glory propped up by a chair, a
tired Marine by a wall in Hue
struggled fiercely to the last to tighten
their grip around the city and tried to
continue supplying their forces within
the citadel, where the main battle was
fought. They failed at the cost, accord-
ing to Government military sources, of
5363 North Vietnamese dead.
The tenacity of the Viet Cong opera-
tion in and around Hue puts the
communist threat along the demili-
tarised zone and at Khe Sanh into a
clearer perspective.
Before the Tet offensive the Marines
had warned General Westmoreland that
Khe Sanh would be attacked as a
diversion to thrusts against the rest
of Quang Tri Province and Hue. This
could still be the order of priorities; the
Marines do not feel that communist
losses in the Tet offensive preclude
a major attack on Khe Sanh. “Let’s
not get enamored of our big kill,” said
one staff officer, “70 percent of the
enemy’s forces are still out in the
paddy.”
The Marines foresee a situation in
which they would be tied up in Khe
Sanh and the demilitarised zone while
the Communists continue their political
and military thrust at the Vietnamese
administration and the populated areas.
This attempt at exploiting a near-
isolation of the American forces is sug-
gested by another passage in the first
decree of the Hue revolutionary com-
mittee. The decree talks of an eventual
situation in which American forces
would cease to interfere in Vietnamese


In the final charge, backed by U.S. Marine artillery, crack South Vietnamese
troops captured the Royal Palace within the Hue citadel walls on Sunday
affairs and stay put in their camps and
bases.
This is not such wild talk as might
at first be supposed, at least so far as
the nervous inhabitants of Quang Tri
and Thua Thien are concerned. There
have long been persistent rumors in
these provinces of a contingency plan
by the Americans and South Vietnamese
to withdraw their forces to the natural
mountain defence line north of Da
Nang. Regular denials of any such
thing by the Government have not
killed the gossip.
Given that today there are 44 Ameri-
can battalions in the north whereas
two years ago there were only two
Marine divisions, these fears look exag-
gerated. But the new Viet Cong offen-
sive, in all its aspects, has possibly had
more success here than anywhere else.
So it is small wonder that'feven Marine
officers these days should be hard
pressed to explain their position in Khe
Sanh. The brave defence of this out-
post seems to have uncomfortably little
to do with the complex communist
effort to take over the whole northern
sector.
Singapore
Year's non-event
AS BRIEFLY reported in last week’s
Bulletin, the people of Singapore
“elected” a new Government on Nom-
ination Day. The 1968 Singapore
General Election ended before any
Party had produced its manifesto and
consequently it would seem likely to
end up as the major South-East Asian
non-event of the year.
Polling day in the seven constituen-
cies wherein 84,883 Singaporean voters
will have a choice is not until April
17. The People’s Action Party could
possibly lose one seat. It would be
surprising if they lost two. It is
distinctly likely that the PAP will in
fact be returned in all 58 constituencies.
Short of all Opposition Parties be-
latedly now getting together and some-
how managing to organise a substantial
protest vote against Lee Kuan Yew in
his Tanjong Pagar constituency—thus
causing the Prime Minister to lose face
—the election “campaign” can con-
tain no surprises.
What does this reduction in absur-
dum of the “consensus” approach
to politics mean? Is it an emphatic
indication that the “action” given the
people by Lee Kuan Yew and com-
pany meets with wholehearted
approval?
Hardly. For one thing, while Singa-
poreans’ political consciousness is high
compared to most Asian States there
is still a good deal of political apathy.
Many Singaporeans are too preoccupied
with their own survival to worry over-
much about what the PAP does for
national survival. The business of many
Chinese particularly is very definitely
business —to the exclusion of politics.
Apathy of a kind is also engendered
by the sometimes too tough a way the
PAP plays it, though this is not the
same as agreeing with the various
Opposition Parties as they now cry
“foul!” Nonetheless there is some truth
in the cynicism that the PAP, having
given a scant nine days for nominations,
would have given only nine days for
campaigning, too, had many opponents
been nominated. Since only seven
came forward it is argued they felt
safe to allow two months. However
this may be, the fact is that politics
is not a genteel pastime. Any Party
that hadn’t already organised itself
with a complete slate of candidates
seven days before dissolution has no
business thinking it can “oppose” the
PAP in the first place. In this sense
Opposition complaints resemble light-
weights arguing whether they should
climb into the ring to fight Joe Louis.
Against this, undoubtedly the long
years of stringent preventive deten-
tion laws have inhibited moderates even
as they have worked effectively to cur-
tail the freedom extremists so easily
abuse in a developing country. Some
would go further and argue that the
real political struggle in Singapore is
between Lee Kuan Yew and Lim Chin
Siong the Barisan Socialist Secre-
tary-General who has been behind bars
a long time and continues to think it
is worthwhile waiting against the day
when Peking pressure prises open his
prison. To a large extent this is
true. Domestically the PAP victory in-
dicates the growth of the Singaporean
English-educated, the Barisan defeat,
the relative decline of the Chinese-
educated. International developments
might change many things. As Lee
Kuan Yew recently pointed out,
essential decisions with regard to Sing-
apore’s future will be taken in Wash-
ington, Moscow and Peking.
Basically, then, the mandate of
heaven is still with the PAP in-
ternally and externally. The Chinese,
after all, unlike Western democrats, do
not see a political dialectic as an essen-
tial part of the political process. The
dialectic comes only when contending
forces dispute the mandate. This
largely uncontested election symbolised
the fact that the PAP retains heaven’s
and the voter’s favor —but in five years’
time the view of things might be very
different.
Put another more Singaporean way,
one might liken this “victory” to the
Singaporean Chinese belief that the
liqueur Benedictine is good for preg-
nant mothers (Chinese advertisements
show them taking it in tumblers) and
that chicken essence can help put them
in the family way. As for such quaint
beliefs, so for the PAP and Lee Kuan
Yew you cannot be certain it works
but it is as good a way of going about
things as there is.
U.S. spy ships
Embarrassing echo
THE TWO United States destroyers
attacked by North Vietnamese patrol
boats in the Gulf of Tonkin in August,
1964, were “intelligence - gathering
vessels.” While denying a complete
identification of the ill-fated Pueblo
mission of last month, the U.S.
Administration has now formally con-
ceded that “electronic surveillance” was
one of the purposes of sending the two
ships into the Gulf of Tonkin. It was
the fourth such espionage mission in two
years.
This is one of a number of new facts
disclosed by testimony given earlier
last week to the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee by Mr. Robert
McNamara and released at the week-
end. In the course of a six-and-a-half-
hour grilling on the incident —which led
to the first American bombing of North
Vietnam and to the passing of a joint
Congressional resolution giving the
President unlimited powers over the
war—the Secretary of Defence also
revealed:
1. That he had been guilty of
“ambiguity” in stating in August, 1964,
that the U.S. Navy “was not aware” of
simultaneous action by the South Viet-
namese Navy against two North Viet-
namese islands. (Mr. McNamara
admitted that what he called “the High
Command” knew all the details, while
even the two American destroyers in


the area at least had knowledge that
the operation was taking place.)
2. That five hours before the 64
American retaliatory air strikes against
North Vietnamese bases the U.S. Naval
Task Force Commander on the spot
sent a message urging “a complete
evaluation before taking any action.”
The Commander warned that “freak
weather effects and over-eager sonar
(radar) men” might have been respon-
sible for earlier reports of enemy
“torpedoes fired” and other contacts.
3. That at one stage even the
Commander-In-Chief in the Pacific,
Admiral Ulysses S. Sharp, had
cautioned the Commander of the
Seventh Fleet that a careful check must
be made to ascertain that there had
been a second North Vietnamese attack
on the destroyers. In doing this, Mr.
McNamara explained, Admiral Sharp
was merely reflecting his own telephone
advice “to be damned sure that no
retaliatory action was taken until any
doubts as to what went on were elimi-
nated.”
Despite this new evidence about an
already highly controversial incident,
the Secretary of Defence vigorously de-
fended the Administration’s decision to
regard what had occurred as sufficiently
serious to justify the first aerial bomb-
ing of the North. In particular, Mr.
McNamara consistently rejected any
allegation that the two American de-
stroyers had at any time infringed
North Vietnamese territorial waters
pointing to the fact that it was not
until September, 1964, that Hanoi first
formally claimed a 12-mile limit.
The orders to U.S. ships were at all
times to stay eight miles from the
North Vietnamese mainland and four
miles from the offshore islands.
Clearly unhappy about the obvious
analogy with the Pueblo incident, the
Secretary of Defence contended that
there was no inconsistency between the
American response in each case and at
one point declared: “I think the Pueblo
case was different in the history that
preceded it. In 1964 we had clear
and convincing evidence that North
Vietnam was directing military opera-
tions of the Viet Cong in the South,
was supplying men for those operations
by sea as well as military material in
large quantities, and, therefore, that
there was greater risk for our operations
in the Gulf of Tonkin than there was in
the waters off North Korea.”
At no point did Mr. McNamara
allow himself to be drawn into the
question of how far the attack could
now be considered to have justified
the President’s immediate request to
Congress for the passing of the so-
called Gulf of Tonkin resolution—the
famous “blank cheque” endorsement of
his conduct of the war.
However, a probably characteristic
Senate reaction came from Senator John
Sherman Cooper, a moderate Repub-
lican. While making it clear that -the
Secretary had satisfied him that an
Hundreds of Asians queuing for vaccination in Nairobi at the weekend hoping
to beat Britain’s immigration restrictions
attack had taken place and that the
whole incident had not been a put-up
job, Senator Cooper said: “I do not
believe that on the facts that have
now been presented to us the nature
and scope of the attack were sufficient
for the submission and adoption of the
Tonkin Bay resolution.”
British immigration
What human
rights?
THE WILSON GOVERNMENT has
gone all the way with Right-wingers
of both parties on measures to stem
the panic flood of Asian immigrants,
with British passports, who are reach-
ing Britain from Kenya. The British
Prime Minister, with a Bill hastily intro-
duced this week, will defend Britain
from its external citizens who do not
happen to have close British connec-
tions—in other words, the non-whites.
Kenya Asians, Malaysians, and others
with full British passports will no
longer enter freely the country of their
nationality; a mere 1500 work vouchers
a year keep them at bay.
This means that the same system will
apply to them, only more strictly, as
applies to those who qualify under the
Commonwealth Immigrants Act. De-
pendants of immigrants under this act
will now be at mercy of wide dis-
cretionary powers exercised by the
Home Secretary before they can join
their relatives. More reasonably, there
are proposals to extend to 28 days the
period within which an illegal immi-
grant is in danger of deportation.
Politicians on both sides of the House
are eager to use social conditions in
Britain as an excuse to keep out more
Commonwealth immigrants and their
families.
However, it is one thing for Britain
to say it does not want the British
citizens of Asian descent who live in
Kenya and another thing to make the
new Bill, which goes through Parlia-
ment this week, work. Constitutional
lawyers have already pointed out it
could be impossible for Britain to en-
force the Act without the co-operation
of the Kenya Government.
Kenya is entitled to refuse to receive
back any British citizens turned away
from Britain after the Bill becomes law
on February 29. If Asians with British
passports but without the necessary
work vouchers arrive in Britain in de-
fiance of the Bill, they cannot be
repatriated to Kenya unless the Kenya
Government is willing to have them.
Nor can they be. sent to any country
but the one from which they began
their journey. Because Britain insists
that its legislation is not depriving any-
body of his existing rights, such people
cannot be made stateless.
Therefore, the entire success of the
Immigrants Bill rests with Kenya. It
is impossible to forecast Kenya’s
attitude to requests to accept the
return of thousands of Asians with
British passports who might continue
to reach Britain. The new Bill antici-
pates this threat by providing for a
fine of £stg2oo and two years’ im-
prisonment for captains of ships or
aircraft who carry passengers con-
travening the regulations. It is impos-
sible to say how effective a sanction
this will provide.
Another difficulty, which the Immi-
grants Bill does not cover, is what
would happen if the Kenya Govern-
ment decided, for reasons of its own
national interests, that it was not will-
ing to allow British subjects to go on
living indefinitely in Kenya. Such a
decision would impose on Britain the
legal responsibility for admitting all
her subjects living in Kenya.
The new Immigrants Bill could also
run into trouble with the European
Court of Human Rights over its
amended conditions by which families
of immigrants can be united. The
court already has before it the com-
plaint of a Pakistani immigrant who
alleges that the existing Act offends
against the Human Rights charter by
preventing his family from becoming
reunited.
The United Kingdom Committee for
Human Rights Year, 1968—appointed
by the Government has protested to
Mr. Wilson that the proposed immigra-
tion laws are a “quite definite breach”
of the United Nations Declaration of
Human Rights.

Backing away from Britain?
“THE BRITISH attitude to Australia
is extraordinary,” said “The Times”
in a recent editorial. “It always
has been. It is a compound of
upper-class condescension, a profes-
sional or intellectual superiority com-
plex, middle-class snobbery over the
accent, and sturdy artisan self-interest.
What European country even the
most parochial and petty-minded if
it possessed the family relationship and
cultural affinities with Australia that
Britain has would take them so lightly
and leave their upkeep so nonchalantly
to a small minority of the footloose and
the fonvard-looking? Australia is for
Britain a window' on a wider and sun-
nier, if in many ways more strenuous,
world . . . Britain’s future, once present
difficulties are overcome, ought to con-
tain a return to, and a rediscovery of,
Australia. Otherwise a coming, and
claustrophobic, British generation may
have bitter regrets over a lost inheri-
tance.” On this an Australian can only
comment: serve them right. Almost all
of the drift in relations between Aus-
tralia and Britain has been on the
British side. It is Britain that has done
the backing away, or the falling down,
and although this does not provide any
occasion for recrimination on Austra-
lia’s part (because Australia should
not expect anything of Britain by
right) it does mean that Australians
should now concern themselves with
the question of whether there is any
backing aw'ay of their own that they
should now engage in. In this article
w'e survey some of the possibilities.
Britain as a problem in foreign
policy. Australia should at once estab-
lish its relations with Britain on a
normal diplomatic basis. It has been
our habit to give a special status to
relations with Britain as if it were some
special kind of country. The Australian
High Commissioner in London has
traditionally been a former Cabinet
Minister (and usually an Anglophile):
he should now be a professional diplo-
mat. Relations with Britain, unlike
relations with every other country, have
been controlled by the Prime Minister:
they should now be controlled by the
External Affairs Department. This
change should be carried out partly as
a sign of the times, but there is a
more important reason than that, and
this is that we should now adopt a
policy of trying to force the English
elites to have a policy toward us that
better suits our interest and that is
different from the condescension cor-
rectly described by “The Times.” The
way to do this is not by the old
sycophancy but by bringing pressure
on to the elites through the ordinary
British people, who are not con-
descending toward us but see us as
cousins. This means that we must learn
to speak out not as whingers, but
as a nation determined to go its own
way with no special regard for Britain.
A skilful use of honesty rather than
flattery could turn the question of
Britain’s relations w'ith Australia into
a political matter, and this should be
our objective; it might then mean that
British Governments would be more
anxious to save our friendship. At the
same time we might save a little money
on Australian representation in Britain.
For the moment we spend more in
London than we spend altogether on
our embassies in the United States,
Japan, Indonesia, New Zealand,
Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Cam-
bodia, Thailand, Taiwan, and Korea.
The myth of the Commonwealth.
The Commonwealth has been all but
useless to its member countries, other
than Britain. It has been of some use
to the African States as a pressure
group, but its principal function has
been to act as a sop to British self-
esteem. Since the very stuff of the
“English sickness” has been English
illusion and conceit, it might do Brit-
ain good if the Commonwealth broke
up in some dramatic and humiliating
way. A more imaginative Australian
Government might have threatened to
• withdraw from the Commonwealth this
year, in a protest that could have been
made on behalf of Malaysia and Singa-
pore, after the British announced that
they were going to break their promises
to those two nations. This would have
created such a shock among ordinary
Britons that their elites w’ould have had
to take it into account. In the future
we should not hesitate to treat the
Commonwealth as a disposable thing.
Its rhetoric of racial tolerance is in
itself admirable, but it merely serves
as a cloak for the realities of intoler-
ance in race relationships. It is essen-
tial for Australia’s development as a
nation that we should accept racial
tolerance, but the place for us to do
that is at home.
An Australia-Britain defence pact?
It is sometimes better not to raise
questions to w'hich the answer might
be “no,” but it might now be to Aus-
tralia’s advantage, in co-operation with
New' Zealand, to raise, specifically and
publicly, the question as to whether
Britain would now be prepared to
enter into a pact with us in which all
three parties would be pledged to assist
each other in the event of some exter-
nal aggression, even if only in limited
ways. If the answer was “no,” the effect
of this on ordinary people in both
Britain and Australia would be bene-
ficial. If the answer was “yes,” we
would have gained something.
Australia’s role in South-East Asia.
We should cease talking about filling or
not filling “vacuums” in South-East
Asia, or even thinking any more about
the British in that area. Our ultimate
strategic objective should be a mutual
non-aggression pact between ourselves
and our neighbors. Our economic
strength is equal to that of our four
nearest South-East Asian neighbors
combined and we should be prepared
to use this strength in the area, at
some cost to ourselves, to the advantage
of our neighbors; we should greatly
increase efforts at cultural, intellectual,
industrial, and general social exchange
wdthin our region; because it might
come in handy, we should increase Aus-
tralia’s military strength, not just by
spending money but also by using our
brains to get more for the money we
spend, so that we have a credible force
of a standard required for its tasks; in
the meantime, if Singapore and
Malaysia want us to help them with
their own defences when the British
go, we should help them in what seems
the most effective way (which does not
necessarily mean providing the same as
the British only less of it). If we have
good luck in our end of South-East
Asia and regional co-operation grows,
Australia should help in the business of
trying to interest external powers in
the region. If Britain is not interested,
what does that matter? Why not
Canada? Sweden? France? There
are a lot of industrial nations in the
world prepared to play some role ir>
the developing areas.
Living with America. By any ordin-
ary rules, the British departure from
Malaysia-Singapore gives Australia a
slightly stronger position in its rela-
tions with America; however, no one
can predict what America’s attitude to
South-East Asia will be by the time
the last British forces go. The best
policy for Australia is to play a role
in the Malaysia-Singapore-Indonesia-
Philippines area commensurate with
its comparatively great economic
strength. There are no greater sup-
porters than the Americans of the idea
that Australia should play a strong,
independent role in this region. By the
beginning of the next decade the
Americans are most likely to help those
who help themselves.
Co-operating with New Zealand. The
New Zealanders have been more
shocked by the sight of Britain’s back
than the Australians. This is the time
when Australia should extend a few
more fingers of the hand of brotherly
co-operation to New Zealand. But, to
be effective, co-operation should be
built up from the bottom, on easy issues
first. For the moment the questions that
divide the two nations principally
economic questions should be
ignored, if they are too hard, and this
is no time to be raising grandiose
schemes of political unity. We should
be exploring instead those hundred and
one forms of minor co-operation
and not only between governments —-
that are likely to work, on something
of the same patterns as those by which
the Scandinavian nations have extended
co-operation between themselves.
Winding up in the South Pacific.
Even at the time when Mr. Wilson was
pledging a continued British presence
East of Suez, his Government was
anxious to grant independence to the
500,000 people of Fiji and to hand over
the 150,000 living in the smaller South
Pacific islands to Australia to administer
and finance. But Australia rejected this
responsibility, and the Colonial Secre-
tary, having visited Fiji, feared for the
effects of independence on inter-racial
relations between Indians and Fijians.
Besides, the $3,000,000 a year that
Britain puts into these colonies seemed
hardly worth saving. Australia has been
rather flinty-hearted toward these de-
pendencies. Apart from founding and
paying a third of the bill for the South
Pacific Commission, its aid to the region
is a modest $420,000. It has started a
small training program and sent out a
few experts and a bit of equipment, but
three years ago it refused a loan of
$12,000,000 for Fiji development (al-
though Australia is the power that
makes money out of Fiji). Australia’s
unspoken policy has been to encourage
the colonial powers in the South Pacific
France and the United States as well
as Britain—to stay put. However, if the
British ever wanted to pass on their
responsibilities in this area, to whom
could they pass them on other than to
Australia and New Zealand?
Britain as Australia’s bank. Even
before Britain’s devaluation knocked
something like $lOO million off our
London funds (and cost us $4O million
in insurance cover), there had been a
steady decline in Britain’s role as our
anker, from 80 percent of total over-
seas reserves to about 60 percent by the
ovember devaluation. About 60 per-
cent of our reserves are still held in
ondon, although only about one-third
0 our foreign trade is with sterling
countries. It is believed that one reason

so much of our foreign exchange is kept

ling £2BO million after devaluation)
and it is reluctant to switch more
funds out of Britain for fear of losing
the right to refinance loans m London.
T ° ~ ...
In any case, these loans will now cost
i * j ,
less to redeem and the interest bill will
be smaller and the same goes for
private-company borrowing in Britain.
For example, as a result of devaluation,
BHP will save $2.68 million on the re-
payment of its £stg.7-|- million debent-
ures issue to London that matures from
1977 to 1987. And it will also save
about $3 million in interest. Unless
there is a complete collapse of the ser-
vices provided by the City of London
—insurance, shipping, capital-raising—
there will always be some incentive for
Australia to use London as one of its
banks, no matter what happens to
sterling as a world currency. And the
fact that so many companies in Aus-
tralia are British subsidiaries or associ-
ates will also keep London as a large
centre of financial interest for us. But
there are many strong reasons for
switching a larger proportion of our
reserves into dollars, even though this
currency does not look very safe either.
The continuing increase in govern-
mental dollar loans and the large
private borrowings to finance develop-
ments, for example, could provide some
incentive to cover them more satisfac-
torily with foreign balances in dollars,
particularly as this borrowing market
looks like being far more important in
the future than Britain. Then there is
the simple and sensible advantage in
bargaining with the U.S. that would
come from having a large proportion
of our reserves in dollars. Australia
has to make up its mind which of the
two countries, Britain or the U.S., it
would most like to maintain this sort
of negotiating position with, realising
that it is impossible ever to have a
really strong position in the U.S.
because of our size and that we have
special reasons for keeping dispropor-
tionate amounts in Britain.
Britain as a trading partner. In trade,
the major switch away from the old
reliance on Britain as a market and a
supplier seems certain to continue. Two

years ago, Britain and Japan were about
on a par as major markets for Aus-
tralian exports; last year Japan in-
creased its buying by 25 percent while
Britain took 15 percent less, to fall into
third place behind North America in
the major customer league. Britain, as
a customer, has backed away from us
faster than we have backed away from
Britain. Sixteen years ago Britain took
about one-third of Australia’s exports,
but this proportion has come down
(largely because of the drop in wool)
to only about 12 percent. But while the
proportion of British goods that make
up Australia’s imports has come down
by half in 16 years, it is still around
23 percent. This has happened mainly
because the British industries, such as
the textile industry, that use our imports
have struck bad times. Direct competi-
tion from other suppliers, evident in
butter, for instance, where we have to
share the market on a quota basis, or
in meat, has not been nearly as strong,
but if devaluation is making it greater
and if Britain goes into Europe it
would become very great indeed. There
is still a tendency for many British
goods to be imported into Australia
only because of the past associations the
importing companies have had with
British companies, or because they are
British subsidiaries, or simply because
other countries have not built up a big
enough trade in them to Australia to
justify having an Australian agency for
them. This sort of trade is certain to
decline. In addition, the Government’s
keenness to wipe out British prefer-
ential tariff entry into Australia in ex-
change for greater entry into other
markets, like Japan, will remove from
many British goods the temporary price
benefits they should get from devalua-
tion. On top of that, Australian com-
panies affected by any increased com-
petition from Britain can complain
about it to a committee that has been
set up by the Department of Trade.
Continuing pressure from Japan for a
greater share of Australia’s imports (the
trade imbalance is now about two to
one in our favor, with our exports there
set to soar when the iron-ore boom
hits top gear in a couple of years)
should also knock British exporting
interests. British shipping lines are tak-
ing the view that their future lies
increasingly in handling Australia’s


BACKING AWAY?
Asian trade. Late last year there was a
bitter struggle by three British shippers
to force their way into the nine-member
“Conference” handling Australia’s Asian
trade in a fight that jeopardised their
positions in a new containerised con-
sortium to handle our British trade.
The British as investors in Australia.
British investment in Australia was cut
in half last year and at only $137 mil-
lion made up only about 28 percent
of the total from all countries, com-
pared with 45 percent from 1962 to
1965. American and Canadian invest-
ment here last financial year was about
double that of Britain and made up
54 percent of the total; only two years
before Britain had been clearly our
biggest source of capital. Since then
there has been a massive inflow of
British funds here, firstly as a hedge
against sterling devaluation and then
simply as an investment decision to
get into an expanding market. If
Britain’s devaluation works and its
economy gets back on the move, this
investment in Australia could well ease
off as opportunities develop in Britain
but offsetting this would be an im-
provement in direct investment by com-
panies in their sudsidiaries or associates
in Australia. For Britain’s stake here is
very large. If devaluation fails, the
flight of British money here could rise
even further, unless the British Gov-
ernment takes such stringent capital
controls that sterling would have ceased
to be useful as a reserve currency. Two
years ago the British Government
severely limited the amount of direct
investment British companies could
make in Australia, although it left the
way open for investors to buy Aus-
tralian shares. The recent metals boom
on the Stock Exchange has been largely
kindled with British money and its
dwindling strength reflects a fall in the
flow from Britain, allied with the pros-
pect of even more restraints in next
month’s British Budget. It is probably
because of this Government policy (and
along with hard times for many British
parent companies at home) that the
proportion of profits earned on British
investment in Australia has gone up
from 40 percent to 60 percent in the
past four years. The decline in British
investment here reflects a decline in the
flow of British technology; far more
advances in local technology nowadays
owe their origin to the U.S. than to
Britain, as the U.S. has tended to con-
centrate its investment in new industries
(or at least those where technological
developments have been strikingly
large), while the bulk of British in-
vestment has tended to be in areas of
no technology whatsoever, like com-
merce (British money has financed a
major proportion of the recent re-
development of Sydney’s office jungle
around Bridge Street), or where tech-
nology is less important, as in merchant
activity. Unless Britain goes broke we
are likely to continue to receive British
money, its flow limited by what hap-
pens back home, but we are not going
to get much in the way of British skill
and ideas.
The boom in immigration. In 1959
Sydney University published a Current
Affairs Bulletin entitled “British Emi-
gration—End of an Era?” The pamphlet
concluded with an emphatic affirmation.
The author, a well-known demographer,
expressed no doubt whatever that the
era of British immigration to Aus-
tralia was coming to an end. He could
hardly have been more wrong. The past
four years have seen the largest inflow
of British immigrants to Australia in
our history, at a figure more than double
the 1950 s average. Our net immigration
gain is now more British than at any
time since the post-war immigration
started in 1947 almost two-thirds,
compared with as little as a third in
the 19505. Other European countries are
developing economic growth rates which
have given their nationals that sense of
continuing improvement in material liv-
ing standards that is supposed to mark
a modern industrialised society, but the
British will probably keep on coming
to Australia, whatever the relations be-
tween our governments: people can
sometimes see things that their govern-
ment is too clever to understand.
Going overseas. Australians are still
going to go to Britain for a holiday,
or to work there for a while, or for
further training, or to live there for
good. The reasons why they choose
Britain are much the same as the
reasons why British immigrants choose
Australia the language, the sense
of commonalty. But Britain is no longer
the most exclusive country of destina-
tion for those who seek their liberation
“overseas.” Holiday patterns are be-
coming more diverse; the enticements
of America will drain more of our
brains; and the future of immigration
from Commonwealth countries into
Britain becomes more uncertain. As
colored peoples take the rhetoric of
the Commonwealth seriously, and the
British resist their settling in Britain,
there is a tendency to restrict this
immigration by methods that appear to
be “fair” in not discriminating between
one Commonwealth country and the
other, so that Australians face some
restrictions. But, apart from this, there
is a rapid widening of horizons. In
five years in the 19605, while the num-
ber of Australian residents travelling
abroad for business or holidays doubled,
the number going to Britain increased
only slightly. Not only is the propor-
tion of Australians who go to Britain
for education or further training grow-
ing smaller: the total number is also
growing smaller.
Doing ourselves honor. The Vietnam
War has caused the first serious chal-
lenge to London as the fount of Aus-
tralian honor. The Returned Soldiers’
League is bitterly angry that the award
of medals to Australian soldiers is still
controlled from Britain, with the
humiliation not only of delays but also
of having Australian gallantry in Viet-
nam awarded under methods controlled
by a power that is not fighting in Viet-
nam. Of the awards announced last
week, many were for engagements as
long ago as last April. Most of the
soldiers decorated are now back in
Australia; some of them have been dis-
charged. There are also complaints of
the embarrassments caused by tying to
British conventions Australian attitudes
to decorations from Allied powers. The
RSL, quite correctly, wants the whole
thing handed over to the Australian
Governor-General. This is supported by
almost all the younger service officers,
who prefer an “Australian” style to a
British one, but it is resisted by the
older men, who usually still model
themselves on the English style. How-
ever, if the RSL really presses the Gov-
ernment on this subject, it is likely to-
win. If it does win this will leave us
in the situation in which while ser-
vicemen’s medals become of Australian
origin the rest of our honors system
will still be tied to the antiquities of
Old England, a system that might some
day best be resolved by dispensing alto-
gether with British honors, as the
Canadians have, and as almost every
other Commonwealth country has. To
get ourselves a flag of our own, as the
Canadians have, all we need do is to-
declare our ensign a flag; it seems
ridiculous that the Union Jack should
still flap over the residences of Austra-
lian Governors or even be seen at all
in Australia, except at flags-of-all-
nations displays, or on the car of the
British High Commissioner. And the
recent new orchestration of “Waltzing
Matilda” shows that we have the music
for a national anthem, so why don’t
we have our own national anthem, as
every significant Commonwealth coun-
try has, apart from New Zealand? And
it may soon be time for us to consider
the fact that of the 26 Commonwealth
countries Elizabeth II is now Queen
only of Britain, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, Ceylon, Sierra Leone, Trini-
dad, Malta, The Gambia, Guyana, and
Barbados.
One Bulletin reader recently wrote to
us saying that Australia had always let
Britain down—Gallipoli, Greece, Crete,
Tobruk, Singapore ... we had a history
of surrender! But apart from Australians
like this, whose Anglophilia is a reflec-
tion of mental disturbance, the change
in Australian attitudes to Britain that
began when Singapore fell in 1942 has
accelerated in the last few years, and
particularly in the last few months.
However, while it is now something on
which most people are likely to agree
at a cocktail party, there is still a slow-
ness to contemplate the full implica-
tions of our mutual drifting away. It
may only be when the forms and cere-
monies of Australian national life are
completely de-Anglicised that we shall
fully act as a nation that understands
where in the world it is.

The Great Arbitration Court Robbery
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
BEHIND AND ABOVE the Chief
Justice’s chair in the No. 1 Court
of the Arbitration Commission rests the
Australian coat-of-arms, with crown,
kangaroo, emu, and shield. The cham-
ber owes its existence to Section 51 of
the Constitution, which empowers the
Federal Government to make laws “. . .
for the peace, order, and good govern-
ment of the Commonwealth with re-
spect to . . . Conciliation and arbitra-
tion for the prevention and settlement
of industrial disputes . . .”
After the events of recent weeks it
might be suggested that these words be
dropped, another instrument be placed
alongside the shield on the coat-of-arms
on the Arbitration Commission wall,
and the inscription added: “I bring not
peace but a sword.”
On December 11 last year the nation’s
metal trades workers were toiling away,
fitting, turning, and forging, vaguely
waiting for some kind of a rise apart
from ad hoc factory and shop disturb-
ances, consciously unprepared for wide-
spread strikes and disruptions. Then
came the majority judgment of Mr.
Justice Gallagher and Commissioner
Winter in the Metal Trades work
value case, and the newspaper head-
lines which seemed to declare immedi-
ate pay increases from 10 cents (duster,
and duster’s assistant) to $10.05 (tool-
maker and scientific instrument maker),
with a standard $7.40 raise for quali-
fied tradesmen such as fitters and
turners, boilermakers and faggoters.
Not many weeks later the advocate
for the Metal Trades Employers, Mr.
Jim Robinson, was back in the Com-
mission’s No. 1 Court declaring to
the president, Sir Richard Kirby, and
his four specially summoned colleagues
on the Bench that the metal trades'
were faced with “a nationwide dilemma
without precedent in Australia,” exacer-
bated by an “intractable nationwide
situation of both agitation and confu-
sion,” and the Communist Party and its
associate members in the Metal Trades
Federation were not far away from
organising a national strike.
Strikes and threats of strikes hun-
dreds of thousands of manhours lost
so far; Industrial Court fines which
could mount beyond $250,000 (unions
can be fined $lOOO a day under the
penal powers); wildcat stoppages, work-
to-regulation strikes; rigid adoption of
safety and training procedures; and
even lockouts. To the embarrassment
of the Conciliation and Arbitration
Commission everyone concerned knows
the answer to the question, where did
it all begin?
The more important question is, why?
And an answer involves the rather pre-
sumptuous task of outlining the weak-
nesses in the majority judgment of the
metal trades Bench. But the trouble
which has mounted would seem to sug-
gest that the following criticisms should
be made of the Gallagher-Winter de-
cision:
• In the first place it was not an ade-
quately comprehensive work-value in-
quiry. Although the Gallagher-Winter
judgments propose to lay down rates
of pay for the value of work done by
320 trades and occupations, most of
these were not properly investigated and
some of them were not studied at all.
As the third member of the metal trades
Bench, Mr. Justice Moore, said in his
brief and pertinent judgment: “It is my
view that there was sufficient material
of all kinds before us to allow the
assessment of the work value of ap-
proximately 70 classifications, but no
more.” No such constraints tempered
the findings of Mr. Justice Gallagher
and Mr. Winter, who no doubt were
anxious to get as wide a spread as pos-
sible to the unions which had been
waiting a couple of years for a rise.
However, arbitration must not only
be done, but it must be seen to be done,
and the lack of evidence demanded by
the majority opinion of the Bench will
have the effect of making union leaders
and advocates wonder if there is any
point in a thorough preparation of
work-value cases. Conversely it will
make employers’ organisations lose con-
fidence in the Commission and probably
more intransigent and aggressive about
industrial disputes.
• The majority judgment does not
seem to have been issued with enough
thought to the possible economic con-
sequences. By the time the dust has
finally settled, it is quite possible that
the metal trades wage bill will rise by
something between $6O million and
$9O miliion annually. Despite the
Gallagher-Winter suggestions of the
opposite, some substantial flow-on is
inevitable to other industries Mr.
Justice Moore said, “No matter how
hard we may try to prevent any flow
from this decision it is my view that
some flow is likely to occur.” The
flow-on possibilities have been vari-
ously estimated.
Even allowing for exaggeration, it
was not altogether surprising that the
Minister for Labor and National Ser-
vice took the unusual course of criticis-
ing the Commission in public, exploding
into print with “History will determine
whether the members of the Commis-
sion which today handed down majority
decisions in the Metal Trades case came
to a calamitous conclusion with lasting
consequences for the Australian econ-
omy . . . the decision disregarded the
most elementary workings of the Aus-
tralian labor market . . .”
• The Commission’s escape clauses for
employers in the words of Justice
Gallagher “there is nothing in principle
to prevent an employer from using
existing over-award payments to offset
the increases” seem to have been in-
serted without any idea of their conse-
quences or much attention to the previ-
ous history of metal trades awards. On
page 151 of his judgment Justice Gal-
lagher actually notes that “employees
almost invariably receive over-award
payments and in the past increases to
marginal rates made on economic
grounds have not been absorbed (my
italics), that is to say, employees have
continued to receive tbe over-award pay-
ment and the arbitral increase has been
added to it . . .”
In the light of this insight it is sur-
prising that Mr. Justice Gallagher did
not see that a break with the tradition
of loading arbitral increases on to over-
award payments was likely to be in-
terpreted by many workers and union-
ists as an attack on just wages. In his
commendable attempt to bring award
wages in line with actual wages, Mr.
Justice Gallagher noted the traditional
practice and then forgot its likely im-
portance. There can be little doubt that
if he had thought more about the way
the unions would react the increases
granted would have been significantly
smaller; and employers may have paid
them without hedging.
• The Commission paid no attention
to the manner in wbich its judgment
would be reported. It may have been
irresponsible or at least careless of the
Press to splash the amount of the in-
creases in the headlines without giving
due attention to the absorption clauses
in the Gallagher-Winter judgments,
but the mood to create the biggest sensa-
tion was predictable. To many workers,
who did not bother with the fine print,
it seemed that the Arbitration Commis-
sion had given them increases which the
employers were trying to take away by
legalistic skulduggery. Some union
officials have played quite dishonestly
on this suspicion; others have rather
understandably been reluctant to put
the employers’ case to their members.
• The proceedings of the Commission
were quite deficient in not properly
ascertaining the extent and nature of
over-award payments in the metal
trades, and the various other fringe and
substantial benefits in the forms of
bonuses, piece-rates, holidays, superan-
Arbitration Commission president Sir
Richard Kirby...
nuation, security, which affect conditions
of employment. The Commission was in
the position of making a substantial
award without knowing exactly wh<it
was happening in the industry. Justice
Higgins of the original basic wage de-
termination would not have approved.
In balance it should be pointed out
that the members of the Commission
responsible for the majority judgment
have previously distinguished themselves
with their tolerance, good judgment,
and arbitral skill, particularly Justice
Gallagher in the Maritime and Coal
industries. Therefore it may be better
to look for the source of the present
trouble in the arbitration system as pres-
ently conducted rather than concen-
trate on one slip-up from a particular
Bench.
The chief weaknesses of Australian
Federal arbitration would seem to be
these:
1. The ambiguity in the Act itself as
to how much weight the Commission is
to give to the effects of its decisions on
the economy;
2. Arbitration and the protection it
offers have encouraged the continued
presence of small unions weak in mem-
bership, finance, leadership, and research
resources;
3. Basic wage rises in recent decades
have tended to help the more skilled
workers at the expense of the poorer.
As one of Australia’s foremost authori-
ties on industrial relations, Mr. Ray
O’Dea, has put it: “The lowest paid 20
percent of award employees depends
most on the basic wage increase, but
the virtually automatic rises in fares on
public transport bears on it most
heavily. The last basic wage increase
was not followed by higher consumption
as was hoped, but by higher savings,
obviously not by the lowest paid because
the cost of basic commodities quickly
ate up the wage increase.”
4. Again, in the words of O’Dea,
arbitration discourages responsibility in
the parties for compromise and co-
operative effort to raise productivity.
For example, a union can gain a wage
rise through arbitration and not have
to improve productivity through aband-
oning dargs, ‘make-work,’ and ‘feather-
bedding’ practices.”
These weaknesses are however largely
offset by a number of advantages which
countries in which collective bargaining
is the rule do not have:
L Uniform wages and conditions have
prevented pockets of underprivilege
from developing in Australia as they
have in the U.S.A. and even in Britain.
2. Weak unions and employees who
might otherwise be exploited by power-
ful employers are able to seek and win
the protection of the Commission at
little cost or effort to themselves.
3. By and large, the arbitration sys-
tem seems to solve more disputes than
it raises, and to create more industrial
peace than would apply under collective
bargaining. A British Ministry of Labor
Bulletin of 1965 showed that on a
ten-year average Australia lost 378 days
per year per 1000 employees compared
with a loss in the United States of 1044
days. The Australian figure was lower
than that of Belgium, Canada, Den-
mark, Italy, and Japan.
In addition it should be remembered
that, despite the Jeremiah tones of em-
ployers’ spokesmen and industrial ad-
ministrators, a certain amount of fric-
tion is unavoidable in a mobile economy
in which expectations of workers are
led to increase at the same rate as the
Gross National Product and probably
faster than real productivity. The
existence of militant ideologues and
virtual agents of hostile powers on the
scene is a contributing factor but not
always a primary cause of events.
It sets things in balance to read the
words of a former Prime Minister. “All
the machinery has been created, every-
thing has been provided to ensure an
ideal position in industry, but unhappily
the result has not been what was ex-
pected. The Arbitration Courts have
been defied, organisations have flouted
awards, and have arrogated to them-
selves the right to obey the, law when
it suits them, and when it does not to
resort to direct action. The great
majority of trade unionists in Australia
desire to see arbitration functioning suc-
cessfully, but the extremists are deter-
mined that it shall not. Surely there is
something tragic in a democracy such
as Australia, in the will of the few over-
riding the wishes of the majority.” Lord
Bruce, in 1928.
Some changes in arbilraiion and in
the regulation of the economy can be
effected only by Constitutional altera-
tions, which an appeal to the voting
public is unlikely to bring about. Others
might be achieved by imaginative Com-
monwealth policies which would cut too
soon across the interests of powerful
pressure groups: and are therefore not
much more likely to be made than the
former. A proper incomes policy, for
example, would run into insurmountable
barriers on both grounds.
Whilst it is inevitable that there will
be some less rewarding aspects of a
compulsory arbitration system, three
strong suggestions may be made for its
improvement. The first is to amend the
Arbitration Act to .stress the importance
of the economic consequences of the
Commission’s decisions. The Metal
Trades Employers’ Federation has been
working for this for some time. The
Vernon Committee was equally con-
cerned with the economic consequences
of the Commission’s decisions.
Another recommendation is that the
Government work hard to improve the
quality of men, both judges and com-
missioners, who have the responsibilities
of making the system work. The Metal
Trades work-value case apart, there
have been some curious and self-contra-
dictory judgments made over the past
15 years, and a general criticism is that
the Commission is not generally intelli-
gent or experienced enough to ask the
key questions and assemble the most
appropriate data for resolving its cases.
Perhaps the best suggestion and it
may go deeper than the previous two
is to attach to the Commission a
thoroughly professional research and
advisory bureau of economists and in-
dustrial-relations experts. The Act has
been tampered with in various minimal
and major ways nearly 50 times since
1954 without much improvement.
If the Commission had its own expert
methods of quickly calculating the eco-
nomic consequences of its decisions, it
would probably take them much more
into account (and it is worth noting
that there have been times when the
“capacity of the economy to pay” was
uppermost in the Commission’s mind).
It could also gain protection from
questionable decisions such as the Metal
Trades judgment if its own industrial
relations bureau were available to advise
on the likely industrial consequences of
decisions before they were proclaimed.
In matters of doubt the Commission
would then be much more inclined to
return to the parties to find out how
they would react and how trouble from
disagreements about awards might best
be avoided.
A bureau of professional advisers and
research workers might also lead the
Commission to treat its jurisdiction less
in legal terms with the advocacy, rhetor-
ical exaggeration, and debating that im-
plies, and more in terms of the total
factual situation, negotiation, and com-
promise settlement such as the one
i cat bed last week.
A\iih its role in determining wages,
industrial peace and therefore produc-
tion, and, one hopes, its eventual influ-
ence on productivity, the Arbitration
Commission is not so far behind Treas-
ury in its national economic importance.
It seems time it was manned so that in
quantity and quality its performance
could match its responsibilities.
Six presidential members, a dozen
Commissioners, a couple of Conciliators,
their personal assistants, and some cleri-
cal staff is a relatively small outfit for
the making of such huge decisions.
Apart from Dr. Sharp, the Registrar,
and, of course, the judges, no one else
in the Arbitration Commission’s head-
quarters, so far as is known, has a uni-
versity degree.
If the Commission is to perform well,
contribute to economic efficiency, ad-
minister justice, and settle disputes in-
stead of creating further ones, the best
investment for its future may be in the
services of an adequate professional staff
to assist in charting the economic and
industrial background and foreground
of disputes. The capital outlay would
be returned in the prevention of an
average-size strike.

Behind North Korea’s Nev Belligerence
By JOSEPH KUN
THE MOST important question to be
answered about the Pueblo incident re-
mains: what led the North Koreans to
carry out their daring and successful
raid on a U.S. Navy ship? This ques-
tion is heightened by the fact that North
Korea, in spite of its sizable land forces
and its Soviet-built air force, remains a
third-rate conventional military power
only recently recovered from the des-
truction of the Korean War. Its fac-
tories, hydro-electric plants, railways,
and airfields are highly concentrated
and vulnerable targets well known to
American intelligence. There is, of
course, no complete and satisfactory
answer; but a close look at North
Korea’s current position in the inter-
national Communist movement, the
country’s domestic problems, and the
views of its leaders on the problem of
Korean reunification can give some in-
sight into the origins of the episode.
North Korea’s stand in the inter-
national Communist movement has
been characterised by its striving for
noncommitment between the Soviet
Union and China. But noncommitment
has been elusive because of a variety of
factors: the country’s size (a territory of
only 46,800 square miles with a popu-
lation of less than 13 million) its loca-
tion (the only Communist country be-
sides Mongolia having common bord-
ers with both China and the Soviet
Union), and its status as a divided
country with U.S. forces stationed im-
mediately to the south.
In the face of this American presence,
the North Korean regime could only
have been irritated by Khrushchev’s
views on peaceful coexistence as enunci-
ated at the Twentieth Congress of the
Soviet Communist Party in 1956.
Pyongyang-Moscow relations were
worsened, too, by Khrushchev’s
advocacy at the same meeting of the
elimination of the cult of personality,
which prompted a number of ambitious
North Korean Communists to attempt
in vain to undermine the position of
party boss Kim II Sung. And in the
example of Khrushchev’s roughness to-
ward smaller Communist Parties such
as the Albanian, the North Korean
leadership saw a potential menace to
the independence of the Korean Work-
ers’ Party (KWP).
In 1962, shortly after Albania’s ex-
pulsion from the Communist common-
wealth and under the direct impact of
Khrushchev’s Cuban fiasco, the North
Korean Communists began to follow a
pro-Chinese (and consequently anti-
Soviet) line. For the next two years or
so, they were China’s staunchest ideo-
logical allies except for the Albanians.
With the ouster of Khrushchev in
October, 1964, North Korean politics
entered a new phase. In the emergence
of the new Soviet leadership, the Pyong-
yang regime saw an opportunity to
steer the country back toward what it
considered to be an uncommitted stand.
Soviet military aid was soon resumed,
and trade relations between North
Korea and the Soviet Union were nor-
malised. But the balance had just been
regained when the Chinese Cultural
Revolution intervened. Maoist extrem-
ism in China and Peking’s growing
pressure on other parties for ideological
allegiance, inevitably alienated the
North Koreans. Thus, somewhat unwill-
ingly, North Korea began to lean even
more toward Moscow, forming closer
ties economically, politically, and in
Party affairs.
This change, however, does not neces-
sarily mean that the Russians are now
“in” in Pyongyang. When advising the
North Korean regime on delicate politi-
cal situations such as the one arising
from the Pueblo seizure, Moscow may
have some difficulty in recommending
caution, for the dogmatists in Pyong-
yang would be ready to cite such advice
as new evidence of Moscow’s inclination
“to preach class collaboration and to
give up fighting imperialism.” In order
to avoid that stigma, the Soviet leaders
are careful not to take the role of
peacemaker. Yet at the same time they
must be aware that relatively small
incidents may easily lead to regional
conflicts or even to a world conflagra-
tion.
All this shows that on a number of
fundamental issues the differences be-
tween the North Korean and the Soviet
leaders remain substantial. North Korea
continues to profess an attitude of plain
hatred toward the United States
equalled only by that of Cuba. This
policy has been mainly a response to
the presence of American troops south
of the Demilitarised Zone, which the
North Korean leadership apparently be-
lieves to be the mainstay of the present
South Korean Government. Despite
evidence to the contrary, Pyongyang
seems convinced that were it not for
the U.S. troops, the South Korean
people would be both willing and able
to overthrow the Government. Thus
North Korea’s task is not only to en-
courage but also actively to stir up the
Koreans in the south to opposition
against their government and its Ameri-
can ally.
Kim II Sung believes that the north
should form a “powerful revolutionary
base” that would guarantee the eventual
reunification of Korea. But in spite of
tremendous economic assistance furn-
ished to North Korea by other members
of the Communist bloc after the
Korean War and the relative success it
has achieved in the construction of an
industrial base, its economy is still beset
with difficulties.
North Korea’s siding with China in
the Sino-Soviet dispute led to Soviet
economic retaliation. The need to build
up a domestic weapons industry created
by the discontinuation of Soviet mili-
tary assistance severely affected the
country’s overall economic development.
The ambitious targets of the Seven
Year Plan (1961-1967) remain unful-
filled. In October, 1966, the party
openly admitted its failure and, while
blaming the difficulties on the Sino-
Soviet conflict, announced the prolon-
gation of the plan for another three
years. The building of a defence in-
dustry remains the regime’s, major pre-
occupation and continues to retard the
development of the economy. October,.
1966, also marked the beginning of
Pyongyang’s more belligerent policy to-
ward South Korea. At the party con-
ference held in that month, Kim II Sung
called reunification a supreme national
task and an urgent question “that brooks
no further delay.”
Since then, the time limit has been
At the Korean Armistice table ... more incidenw[?]an ever
even more closely defined. “We must
accomplish the South Korean revolu-
tion, unify the fatherland in our genera-
tion,” Kim pledged at a session of the
North Korean “parliament” last
December. “The people in the northern
half of the republic should always re-
member their brothers in the south and
be determined to liberate them at all
costs. . . . They should be firmly pre-
pared ... to accomplish the cause of
unification by joining hands with the
South Korean people whenever called
upon to come to their aid as the
struggle of the people surges forward
and the revolutionary situation ripens
in South Korea.”
The primary cause for this urgency
is Pyongyang’s expressed concern over
the fact that after more than 20 years
of separation, “the gulf between North
and South Korea is growing wider in
the political, economic, and cultural
spheres.” In Kim’s words: “The
national community of our people,
formed through long history, is gradu-
ally fading away.”
The stress placed on the speedy re-
unification of the two halves of Korea
at the last conference of the KWP al-
most immediately resulted in a numeri-
cal increase in North Korean infiltrators
in the south. But it was not only a mat-
ter of numbers: the character of the in-
filtration activity changed from action-
agent espionage into a plainly military
enterprise. In newly established train-
ing centres in North Korea, hand-
picked military personnel (preferably
with family connections in the south)
are being trained to slip into South
Korea and to carry out subversive
activities ranging from sabotage to
assassination.
The band of North Korean infiltrators
that was captured some five hundred
yards from the South Korean Presi-
dential Palace on the night of January
21 possessed all the characteristics of a
well-trained infiltration unit. Among
its members were regular officers of the
(North) Korean People’s Army (KPA).
Consisting of thirty-one members, the
unit was divided into three teams armed
with modern infantry weapons, includ-
uig anti-tank grenades. It was dis-
patched to assassinate South Korean
President Chung Hee Park and other
political figures. Unlike the infiltrators
into South Vietnam, however, the North
Korean teams have found no- under-
ground support in South Korea, whose
citizens feel they have a stake in their
country’s development. In fact, they
have turned in many of the infiltrators.
. Simultaneously with the increase of
infiltration activity there has been a
noticeable increase in the number of
border incidents along the 155-mile-
ong Demilitarised Zone. According to
frequently quoted figures, the number
of incidents rose from 50 in 1966 to
some 550 in 1967. Significantly, one of
the sharpest of such incidents, signal-
ling the beginning of a new phase of
activity, took place during President
Johnson’s visit to Seoul in November,
1966, less than a month after the last
KWP conference.
The sudden increase in North Korean
belligerence was clearly connected with
the changes that occurred in the leader-
ship of the KWP at that conference.
Of the 11 full and alternate members
newly elected to the Politburo, six held
the rank of general. They included such
high-ranking military figures as the
chief of the KPA’s general staff,
General Choe Kwang; the director of
the KPA General Political Bureau,
General O Chin U; and the Minister
of Public Security, General Sok San.
The Minister of Defence, General Kim
Chang Pong, was promoted from alter-
nate to full membership in the Polit-
buro.
What moved Marshal Kim II Sung
and his military followers to adopt such
a belligerent policy immediately after
the Party conference? The stepping up
of North Korean infiltration into the
south is undoubtedly designed to slow
the spectacular economic progress of
South Korea and to spread uneasiness
and fear among the population. In con-
trast to the setbacks in North Korea
during the first South Korean Five-Year
Plan (1962-1966) agricultural produc-
tion rose 35 percent and the gross
national product grew some 8.5 percent
a year. Historically, South Korea, with
45 percent of the land area and over
two-thirds of the population of the
peninsula, has been the poorer region.
Thanks to some $4.5 billion in U.S. aid
and the energy of the people in a
revitalised economy, this is not true
today, and the picture of progress in
the south is rankling to the regime in
Pyongyang.
The increase in the incidents along
the Demilitarised Zone is aimed at
assisting the Vietnamese Communists
by diverting the attention of the United
States and by making it difficult for
South Korea to send additional troops
to South Vietnam. And the North
Korean Communists take advantage of
the incidents they provoke along the
Demilitarised Zone to remind their own
population of the constant danger of
“imperialist aggression,” and to demand
of them more vigilance, higher work
efficiency, and more production.
The bellicose leaders in Pyongyang
have on the whole been successful in
their calculations. While the damage
caused to the South Korean economy
by direct sabotage can hardly be meas-
ured in absolute terms, the Republic’s
economy has undoubtedly been strained
by the expense of maintaining an army
of 550,000 men, an estimated 200,000
more than the North Koreans have

NORTH KOREA
under arms. The recent commando-
attempt on Seoul, the first since the
Korean War, was aimed at spreading
confusion not only among the popula-
tion but in the Government as well.
The growing intensity of infiltration
from the north has induced the Govern-
ment' to delay any increase in the
number of South Korean units already
in Vietnam. Further intensification of
the raids could even lead to the recall
of some or all of the 47,000 Koreans,
now serving in South Vietnam.
Finally, the partial success of the
commando raid has created serious
discord between the United States and
the South Korean Government. The
South Koreans resent American pre-
occupation with the fate of the 82 cap-
tured crewmembers of the Pueblo at a
time when, in their opinion, a much
larger issue is at stake. The direct
secret negotiations held over the Pueblo
affair between American and North
Korean representatives (from which
the South Koreans were excluded) did
not strengthen the confidence of the
Republic’s authorities in the solidarity
of its partnership with the United
States.
While the seizure of the Pueblo was
not directly connected with the in-
crease of North Korean infiltration in
the south, it was by no means
accidental. The North Korean leader-
ship knows that the United States is
deeply preoccupied with the war in
Vietnam. Already under attack by
domestic and foreign critics of the Viet-
nam conflict, the U.S. administration
would think carefully before getting in-
volved in a war with North Korea for
the sake of rescuing an intelligence ship
and its crew.
The North Koreans did not miscalcu-
late. The seizure of the Pueblo toqjc the
United States by surprise. And it so
happened that this diversion coincided
with the Viet Cong assault in the cities
of South Vietnam. American attempts to
prevent the capture, undoubtedly ex-
pected by the North Korean military
who sent out eight MIG-2 Is to cover
the manoeuvre, failed to materialise.
Whether the capture of the Peublo was
a long premeditated action or was
prompted by Pyongyang’s firm belief
that the U.S. intruded into North
Korean territorial waters, the ease with
which the seizure was executed and the
lack of American ret...iation can only
lead to further experiments in what the
Communists call “adventurism” and sil-
ence the more cautious elements, if any
exist.
The Pueblo case has undoubtedly
strengthened the influence of the North
Korean military. It must also have rein-
forced their conviction that while in-
volved in a war in Vietnam, the United
States cannot afford to open a second
front in Korea. But if not a second
front, North Korea has now become a
second source of major disturbances.


Raising hell every day
“HOW DO YOU LIKE,” somebody
said as the protesters filed out of the
inquiry at the Sydney Town Hall to
determine whether or not main roads
should slice the newly fashionable sub-
urb of Paddington into pieces, “being
described as a Mallee fowl?”.
The reference was to the suggestion
by poet and broadcaster John Thomp-
son that the inhabitants of Paddington
resembled Mallee fowl, an enclosed
community, he implied, with rituals
and ways of living specifically its own.
However, there are not all birds of
a feather in Paddington, although there
has been a high degree of solidarity
against the proposal to split the suburb
in three and demolish a large number
of terrace and other old houses for the
provision of main roads. Paddington
is still essentially a mixed area and
that is probably its chief charm, al-
though the newcomers have tended to
make it sound rather snobbish, enclosed,
and fiercely self-defensive. Its noted
terrace-houses are now often absurdly
overpriced, pretty enough externally,
but cramped inside with insufficient sun
or air.
But there are many things most
people in Sydney would not like to see
go there, so it is easy to sympathise
with the fury Paddingtonians feel at
the idea of arterial roads pushing
through, making iron spaghetti out of
fancy ironwork, reducing carefully re-
stored houses to heaps of rubble.
Recently, apropos of the renewed
move to bring back Utzon to finish the
Opera House, a letter-writer in “The
Sydney Morning Herald” quoted C.
Hartley Grattan, the writer on Aus-
tralia of an earlier generation, as
saying, “What Australia needs is some-
one to raise hell once a week.” Some-
times it seems now that in some Sydney
suburb or other someone raises hell
once a day. The issues may not be
world shattering, but the fire and fervor
are there.
The Paddington battle is just one
more manifestation of what has been
going on for many years in Sydney.
Few cities in the w'orld can have citi-
zens as zealous of their right to live the
way they want, regardless of city plan-
ners. There is nothing wrong with this,
although at times the arguments for
leaving things as they are do not seem
entirely rational.
For years, arguments have gone on
between the planners and the locals, in
suburb after suburb. Part of the trouble
has been that there is no really
adequately worked out grand plan for
Sydney, as the Minister for Local Gov-
ernment, Mr. P. H. Morton, is the first
to admit, too, much replanning has
taken place piecemeal instead of on
an overall basis.
If Paddington is worried about roads,
then Hunter’s Hill, that calm, rather
selfconsciously beautiful suburb at the
junction of the Parramatta and Lane
Balmain residents make their viewpoint
clear
Cove Rivers, is agitated about home
units. Last month 800 residents cram-
med into the local town hall while
Judge David Hicks, who chaired the
meeting, uttered the warning that
Hunter’s Hill would become “another
Kirribilli.” What the residents of Kirri-
billi, who include the Governor-General
when he is in Sydney, along with a
large number of people who live in
high blocks of units with wonderful
harbor views and plenty of sea breeze,
must have made of that pronouncement
one cannot imagine.
The local council was left in no
doubt of the position it occupied. “I
feel,” added the Judge, “that if the
council subject to pressures from
speculators and developers knows it
is bolstered by a tremendously strong
following in the municipality, it will
make its task more easy in resisting the
inevitable pressure.” In other words, the
unit people may push, but the voting
strength is elsewhere, and don’t forget
it.
Balmain, too, has expressed its rage
in no uncertain manner. Container
berths caused an upset in April, 1967,
and the latest unwelcome arrivals are
chemical storage tanks. At the height
of the container-berth upheaval there
was talk of “a rape of the Balmain
peninsula.” A letterbox opinion poll
was taken, with 14,500 slips sent out,
and there was no doubt where everyone
stood on the issue. Had anyone differed,
they would presumably, like any Pad-
dingtonian who now feebly asked for
a wider Jersey Road, be torn limb from
limb.
Something of the acute historical
consciousness and civic pride of Bal-
mainians can be gauged from letters to
the Press with messages like: “Can one
today find Aboriginal kitchen middens
still intact less than one mile from
the GPO? The caves are safe for the
moment, but already shipyards en-
croach on them . . . that Balmain
should be remorselessly despoiled with
contemptuous disregard for the clam-
orous protests of its 30,000 residents
is an affront to the most basic principles
of democracy and an act of wanton
vandalism by statutory authority.”
No doubt anyone who pointed out
in a faint, small voice that Balmain
was always a place of port activity,
and owed much of its charm to that,
would be silenced with a blow.
Nigel Ashton, chairman of the
N.S.W. State Planning Authority, is an
unusual cross between a suburban,
steady gardening type and a city plan-
ner, conscious of wanting to keep the
wattle-and-blue-gum security of Upper
Suburbia intact, yet by his office com-
mitted frequently to disrupting it. Torn
in two, he is far from being the Baron
Haussman he so much admires, and
often seems to the casual eye to be
reduced to sitting gently but precari-
ously on the sharpened points of a
garden fence.
Yet he came out rather strongly in
the course of a long conversation, on
Balmain: “Where you have ports, you’re
bound to have anti-port activity, and
Sydney is a port. Balmain has had a
good deal of secondary port activity
for a good many years, and you’ve got
to have these things somewhere. No-
body wants them, but you can’t be
friends to everybody.”
However, the saviours of suburbs are
mere tyros at making their viewpoint
heard effectively compared with the
nature conservation groups. One might
easily put them above the National
Trust in their dedication, alertness, and
what is very like cunning at putting
pressure on weak spots.
After a great deal of well-directed
endeavor, and considerable support from
newspapers, a recent decision by the
Administrator of Warringah Shire (put
in when the council was dismissed) to
hand over four acres of Dee Why
lagoon to a bowling club was set aside
by the Minister for Local Government
until the shire has an elected council.
The chances that an elected council
will hold the needs of bowlers above
those of aquatic birds seem remote.
Current agitation is over the decision
by the Minister for Lands to allow an
airport to be built in Duffy’s Forest on
Sydney’s North Shore, adjoining
Kuring-gai Chase. Conservationists here
are fighting for the preservation of wild-
flowers in the area and urging that the
120 acres involved should be joined to
the Chase.
So self-confident have the nature
conservationists grown that one was
recently pressing for the exotic trees
which have been planted in the new
Australia Square replaced with lemon-
scented gums. If that movement gains
strength, what will be the end of Can-
berra?

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Exploring the wayward course
of capital inflow
PREDICTING, EVEN FOLLOW-
ING, the course of capital inflow into
this and any other country is not a
game for tyros, unless they remember
Professor Paisch’s golden rule that if
you’re in deficit on your current account
you are importing capital, and if you’re
in surplus you’re probably—depending
on the fluctuations in your overseas re-
serves —exporting it. One of the
hardest exercises the Commonwealth
Statistician undertakes is to get figures
for capital inflow from year to year,
and he always ends up with a huge
figure for errors and omissions un-
accounted for when he has notched up
all available information on capital
movements. He wouldn’t waste his
time trying to get month-to-month
figures, because he knows it is impos-
sible, at any rate to be of practical use
to anybody, with any degree of accur-
acy or reliability. This is not to say that
the exercise for outsiders is not enor-
mous fun, especially in the December-
January period, when the trade figures
are usually distorted and, in the case
of the two most recent of these months,
trade figures have been the plaything
of shipping disturbances like the Lon-
don docks strike.
It is possible from the trade figures
for these months and the fluctuations
in our overseas .reserves to arrive at a
fantastically high figure for capital in-
flow lately, a sum which if converted
to an annual rate would put even the
high figure for two years ago (1965-66)
in the shade. It would be more than
three times what we had last year. The
usefulness of these arbitrary calculations
(which we will refuse to put a precise
figure on because in fact it would be
misleading) is that they show that—
though the Commonwealth Statistician
himself doesn’t say so —we’ve been the
target of a flood of hot money from
Britain and other, mostly sterling area
sources, in the past five months or so.
It probably reached a peak in Decem-
ber and January sometime (or so it
would seem in the absence of later trade
and reserves figures and calculations on
the basis of them).
There seem to be two points to
make about this. One is that it appears
that most of this money is likely to
stay here indefinitely, though some re-
patriation of it could well occur should
British buyers of our shares (mostly
minerals shares in recent months) de-
cide to take their profits. Even in the
latter event it is on the cards that
rather than send their funds home they
would seek other investment avenues
for them in this country, especially if
(as widely feared in financial circles
here) the British Budget imposes a ban
on overseas portfolio investment by
private British residents (the main
source of the recent bulge in our
capital intake). The other point is that
this bulge should not lull us into a false
sense of security about the future extent
to which we can expect capital inflow
to buttress our balance of payments.
This is not to cry wolf but only to rub
in the message that both the U.S. and
Britain are going to send us less capi-
tal than they have for several years
past and in consequence we will have
to look even harder than we have
been doing to galvanise the balance of
payments through the strong arms of
our trade.
New Zealand
Improving exports
AT LAST THE New Zealanders are
beginning to think we are not such
bad fellows after all. Latest trade
figures show that even before they got
the benefits of devaluation their trade
imbalance with Australia was being
significantly improved. The combina-
tion of dampened demand for Aus-
tralian goods in New Zealand because
of the Government’s generally restric-
tive measures, with an increase in ex-
ports to Australia as N.Z. manufac-
turers were forced to look for markets
and as the Australian economy con-
tinued to go ahead, meant that in the
first five months of the current finan-
cial year N.Z. lifted its exports to Aus-
tralia from one-quarter of the level
of its Australian imports to one-third.
This was the result of a 20 percent
or $4 million rise in Australian pur-
chases of New Zealand goods to $24
million combined with a percent
or $lO million fall to s7l| million
in Australian sales to New Zealand.
According to the New Zealanders, the
improvement in their exports to Aus-
tralia was just about double the 20
percent shown in the Australian statis-
tics, a difference that cannot be ex-
plained by devaluation. Nevertheless,,
the N.Z. Government is clearly pleased
with the increase, no matter what
figure is used: “N.Z. exports to Aus-
tralia have begun to move in the right
direction, said the N.Z. Minister for
Trade, Mr. Marshall, when announcing
his version of the statistics for the first
half of 1967-68 last week.
And now that last November’s de-
valuation has made Australian goods
more expensive to New Zealanders
(and New Zealand exports more attrac-
tively priced to Australians), this trend
could well continue. For it is allied
with continuing tariff reductions under
the New Zealand Australian Free Trade
Agreement, which may well now turn
out to be more to New Zealand’s bene-
fit than Australia’s, despite New
Zealanders’ uneasiness about the
NAFTA when the major dispute be-
tween Australian Paper Manufacturers
and New Zealand’s Tasman Pulp and
Paper Co. was at its height last year.
The major single increase in N.Z.
exports to Australia in the first half of
1967-68 was in forest products, with a
million rise for the first six months
being due mainly to a big jump in
paper (but with timber exports also
contributing following the Australian
Government’s decision to lift the duty
on douglas fir). But major increases
in exports of manufactured goods
meant that forest products’ share of
total trade with Australia eased from 58
percent to 53 percent. To some extent,
the bigger manufactured exports seem
due to Australian manufacturers send-
ing components to New Zealand for
assembly and re-export to Australia.
This appears to have been a factor in
the more than doubling of exports of
some electrical appliances, like refriger-
ators, electric stoves, and electric
shavers.
“Such well-established export lines
as travel goods, crockery, books, toys,
and carpets have all continued to in-
crease,” said Mr. Marshall; floorcover-
ing multiplied by almost seven times to
about $1 million for the six months.
So far Australian manufacturers
have not inundated the Department of
Trade with special complaints about
this increase in N.Z. exporting here,
although some local papermakers are
objecting, and toy-makers have sought
special protection, but mainly from
Britain. Most are making any repre-
sentations they need through the com-
mittees set up to deal with the general
question of devaluation.
But it seems unlikely that the Aus-
tralian Government will take any
action that would seriously restrict New
Zealand’s chances of building up its
exports here, except in those products
where there is some dispute about the
real country of origin.

Tariffs
Japanese hopes
THE JAPANESE WERE BEING very
polite about it, at least not as blunt as
some Press reports (“The Australian’s,”
for instance) would make it appear, but
discrimination written into the tariff
via imperial preferences, and now taken
a considerable distance further in
British exporters’ favor by sterling de-
valuation, has them pretty worried.
Nobody, except The Bulletin, has said
openly that imperial preferences should
be scrapped or phased out, but that is
what the Japanese are thinking, even if,
as Mr. Kimitaka, vice-president of the
Japanese External Trade Organisation,
put it in Melbourne recently, “tariffs
are your business, an internal matter.
We have to adapt. We can only ex-
press a hope.” Maybe Mr. Sato put it
rather more forcibly to Mr. McEwen
in Tokyo last week, along with some
other matters, such as getting an early
and successful conclusion to the nego-
tiations for a double tax agreement be-
tween the two countries, which have
been dragging on for so long.
In some directions, of course, such as
chemicals, Japan has been getting under
the British importer’s belt and, in the
case of the link-up of Sumitomo and
Albright and Wilson (U.K.-owned),
could well expand their already con-
siderable presence in the Australian
market despite the tariff disadvantage.
In others, such as man-made fibres, they
are so near the end of their tether that
they’re going to make a strong protest
about it at the Tariff Board. Again,
although not all that strongly en-
trenched in the Australian market for
toys, Japan will doubtless be cheering
when Australian manufacturers (who
have about half the market in toys, and
Britain the biggest slice of the re-
mainder) make their expected applica-
tion for emergency protection in face
of the flood of cheap toys coming here
from Britain since devaluation of ster-
ling. As much as 12 to 15 percent has
been cut from the price of British toys,
which practically neutralises the appli-
cable 17 percent tariff barrier, which in
any case is much lower than the MFM
rate.
Iron ore
Quality worries
JAPAN IS THE best place to find out
what is happening in the Australian
iron-ore industry. Hamersley Iron’s
technological department chief, Mr.
J. G. Munro, and chief geological en-
gineer, Mr. D. M. Murenna, will be
in Tokyo for four days from March 2,
according to the Japanese trade Press,
to discuss counter-measures for the
drop in the iron content of their fines.
The deterioration became apparent
since early last year, “drawing industry-
wide attention.”
Hamersley guarantee a 62 percent
iron content in the fines, but for many
months this failed to measure up and
dropped as low as 61.4 percent an
important slip to the Japanese steel-
makers with their insistence on a con-
sistent product. During the stay the
two Hamersley men will be discussing
the pellet plant, due to be commissioned
at Dampier on March 15, with the
first shipment in April. If their fines
are not maintaining quality, and fines
are the feed for the plant, it must be
assumed that measures would have to
be taken to ensure consistency of pellet-
plant feed; this would probably entail
crushing high-grade lump ore to get
fines for blending.
Nickel
Finders' keepings
A STUDY in contrasts was thrown up
on the Western Australian nickel scene
by the personalities who have made
their mark on the Kambalda-Kalgoorlie
developments. On the one hand, Mr.
George Cowcill, the prospector who
found the ore that led Western Mining
Corporation to their bonanza at Kam-
balda, complained that his $25,000 re-
ward was inadequate; the company re-
plied, in a restrained manner, that
when he was asked what he thought
his find was worth he suggested $2OOO,
and was astounded when more was
offered.
On the other hand are the Joneses.
Mr. C. B. C. Jones and his sons, Barton
(30), Robert (27), John (24), and
Burchell (22), own “Coona Downs,”
“Cowarna Downs,” and “Hampton
Hill”—stations in the Kalgoorlie area.
But they are also part-time prospectors,
and last week the Jones’ leases became
news. Like Mr. Cowcill, they had dis-
covered ore south of Kalgoorlie before
the boom; now this area is taken up
with mining tenements. But they
moved instead north of Kalgoorlie, up
the Leonora line near Scotia, where
they found nickel ore assaying an
average of 2.54 percent.
They took out their claim and then,
in December, offered an option to six
of the bigger companies; many more
showed interest subsequently. And this
has become the basis for a joint venture
of Great Boulder Gold Mines Ltd. and
North Kalgurlie (1912) Ltd., who
jointly secured the option over the
area 35 miles north-west of Kalgoorlie
(Kambalda is 35 miles to the south-
east). The Joneses won’t say how much
this was worth, but they certainly
would have got more for their find
than George Cowcill did for his.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy : Three months after sterling and
New Zealand devaluations, ' the Australian economy, as
measured by unemployment figures, is declared very steady
. . . Gross national product in terms of 1959-60 prices rose
5.7 percent in 1966-67. The Commonwealth cash loan which
closed on February 3 raised $125 million. Trading bank de-
posits rose to a record $5819.5 million during January.
A Full Bench of the Commonwealth Arbitration Com-
mission ruled that 30 percent of some wage increases granted
to skilled and semi-skilled metal trades employees will be
deferred until at least August, and rejected an employers’
request for a specific award provision permitting absorption.
For the markets l On Australian stock markets, the
mining boards, centre of such intense speculative activity,
took one of their worst beatings ever, and certainly the worst
this year, as fears spread of restrictions by the British Govern-
ment on portfolio investment in Australia. Tuesday and
Wednesday were the worst days, with good recovery evident
by Friday morning.
The London stock market ended the week still on the
downtrack; industrial stocks went into retreat as fears of
a tough budget on March 19 kept buyers at bay . . . The
three-session rally on Wall Street culminated in some profit-
taking, as there was nothing in business news to inspire
further buying, and the possible call-up of 50,000 more
reserves for Vietnam added downward pressure to the list.
For companies: The Commercial Bank of Australia
is offering one CBA share for every three General Credits,
to assume complete ownership of the hire-purchase associate
. . . Boral directors declined to confirm or deny the revived
rumors of a link with the French owned Total group. Duly
and Hansford directors are engaged in negotiations which
could lead to a takeover bid.
Chevron Sydney is making its third repayment of deben-
ture principal (6jjr percent) on March 8. Shareholders and
security holders of ICIANZ are being approached for $l2
million of debenture money . . . Australian Fertilisers share-
holders for a one-for-three issue at $2.50 (50c premium) to
finance the construction of its $lO million sulphuric acid
plant.
At the halfway mark (December 31) Frozen Food re-
corded 34 percent profit increase, allowing earning rate on
bonus-increased capital to rise to 33.6 percent . . . Bond’s
profit was a record, but increases in raw cotton prices, higher
wage costs could reduce profit for the full year . . . Chrysler,
VW, Fiat, Rover, and Japanese car distributor, LNC, more
than doubled profit when sales rose from $14.1 million to
$23.7 million . . . Plastyne’s interim dividend, increased from
4-| to 5 percent suggests an increase in the annual rate for the
sixth successive year. Grace Bros, lifted interim dividend from
6J to 7 percent . . .
WMC made new nickel intersections at Kambalda West,
with grades up to 8 percent . . . and WMC, with BH
South have jointly established big reserves of lithium (the
lightest of all metals, used as a reagent in the manufacture
of organic chemicals) at Mt. Marion, near Kalgoorlie . . .
Nabalco Pty. Ltd. has signed with the Federal Government
to establish an alumina plant at Gove, N.T. EZ’s zinc-lead
deposit at Beltana (S.A.) has proved reserves of 250,000
tons at 40 percent zinc, but the orebody is still only partially
outlined . . . Earnings in the first half were significantly
lower, reflecting delayed sales of lead and copper concen-
trates, and difficult operating conditions in Tasmania . . .
Renison’s rate of tin production has been substantially higher
so far in the current year.
MEN AND MATTERS
THE USUAL complaint that “the
trouble with Australia is there are no
really able managers” is wearing
a bit thin these days. The number of
Australians who have done so well in
local branches of American companies
that they have gone on to greater
successes in America is growing rapidly.
This week, one of them, Matt Lurie,
the 51-year-old vice-president of the
Matson Navigation Company in charge
of passenger ship operations for the past
two years was back to Australia for
a quick visit after attending the 34-
nation meeting in Taiwan of the Pacific
Area Travel Association (of which he
is senior vice-president).
Lurie, an ex-Qantas man who joined
Matson 12 years ago as New Zealand
manager in Auckland, has been head-
quartered in San Francisco (following
a two-year spell in Hawaii) since 1962
as general sales manager for the South
Pacific service.
So he can talk as an American (even
though his accent is still clearly
Australian) when he goes to Washing-
ton soon to press the PATA’s violent
objection to the U.S. Government’s
proposed travel restrictions that are
aimed at saving about $U.5.500 mil-
lion a year in foreign exchange. Since
severe restriction of U.S. travel in the
Pacific area would bring serious dam-
age to the economies of many under-
developed countries (and increase their
need for U.S. aid), Lurie claims that
the more sensible thing for the Govern-
ment to do would be to try to encour-
age more foreign tourists to come
to the U.S. to offset the heavy tourist
imbalance; if last year’s 30 percent
rise in tourists going to the U.S. con-
tinued, this would bring in the same
amount of foreign exchange as the
Government is trying to save by its
proposed restrictions (that would not
only damage the tourist industry but
also invite the threat of foreign
retaliation).
THIRTY YEARS AGO it took rather
longer than it does now to catch the
receptive ear of the Tariff Board from
whom we all need to be protected
almost as much as we need its
protection. When the Australian
domestic washing - machine industry
was in its infancy, it took from 1933
to 1938 for John Edward Stamp,
who at 68 is still head of his family
firm, John W. Stamp Pty. Ltd., Mel-
bourne engineers, who’ve been going
just on a hundred years, to get a high
enough tariff to compete effectively
with imports. Although still keeping to
its proprietary company status (and
without any present intention to depart
from it), Stamps has since grown into
a multi-million dollar business with the
Matt Lurie
J. E. Stamp
highest of reputations in this and other
trades.
Mr. J. E. Stamp, who was at Scotch
and Melbourne university (where he
graduated in science), took over the
management of the firm from his father
(John W.) when it was still a partner-
ship (dissolved in 1929) soon after his
return from knocking about the U.S.
where, for a while, he was a mechanic
in the National Cash Register Co. at
Dayton, Ohio. In the States he picked
up the idea of developing a domestic
washing-machine and, back in Austra-
lia, designed one whose basic principles
are embodied in the firm’s modern pro-
duct which is one of its two biggest
money-spinners. The other is machinery
for the meat industry, long one of the
company’s specialties.

THE HIDDEN WEALTH
WHO WILLTAP IT ?
...rural ‘cost squeeze’ will be beaten by
The Law of the Minimum’
The magnitude of the cost problem fac-
ing the man on the land is illustrated by
the fact that, although rural production
rose by 25% during the 1950’5, net in-
come actually fell by 20% over the
same period. These are official figures
for the Commonwealth of Australia.
To simply say that this can be altered
by increasing yield per acre is to under-
state the dramatic possibilities now being
disclosed by some emerging and startling
facts about plant growth—facts which
will trigger a revolution in agriculture
expansion.
Instead, we now know that if care is
taken to obtain the maximum use of the
resources—soil and water—yield will be
greatly increased and costs substantially
reduced.
The key to the situation is in a simple
but little-appreciated fact of plant
nutrition.
This fact is called ‘The Law of the
Minimum’ and states—‘The growth of
plants is limited by the most deficient
plant nutrient element present, all others
being present in adequate amounts.’
This means that an apparent abundance
of water and soil nutrient elements is
wasted if one of the elements is in short
supply. Thp plant will only progress to
the maximum ‘ceiling’ set by the most
deficient element, and it is a fact that
most Australian soils are deficient in
one or more of the vital elements of
nutrition.
If we can identify, in each particular
case, the elements which are limiting
plant performance and supplement them
readily, the plant (be it crop or pasture)
will use the full contribution to growth
made by all other elements present.

FERTILIZERS:
KEY TO FARM
PROSPERITY
It is immediately obvious that the extra
‘bonus’ in yields will be more valuable
to the man-on-the-land than increased
acreage—fixed costs will not be increas-
ed. He will tap the surplus capacity of
his land at present being wasted.
The process of supplementing the limit-
ing elements of plant nutrition is best
undertaken by the application of chemi-
cal fertilizers containing the elements
vital to plant growth. The most import-
ant of these are nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium and sulphur, because these
are required in large amounts. Second-
ary and trace elements, notably cal-
cium, magnesium, molybdenum, zinc,
boron, are also necessary.
Today, Greenleaf is manufacturing fer-
tilizers containing these elements in the
varying proportions required for the
balanced nutrition of our crops and pas-
tures.

Stock exchanges
and capitalist
imperfections
BY J. C. HORSFALL
YOU DON’T NEED to be an econo-
mist or a finance expert to know that,
under the capitalist system which Aus-
tralia prefers to use somewhat imper-
fectly to conduct its economic arrange-
ments, industries wax and wane accord-
ing to their ability to make profits,
whether such profits result from the
irrational preference exercised by an
unintelligent community or otherwise.
The acknowledged national barom-
eter of the ability of industries and
the various public companies in their
ranks to make profits and so attract
the capital they require to progress is
the stock exchange, even if to out-
siders the several Australian stock ex-
changes sometimes seem to be play-
grounds for gamblers without perhaps
as much gilt about as in Monte Carlo.
In fact, the stock exchanges do this
job of sorting the wheat from the chaff
pretty well. And one doesn’t necessarily
have to participate in the play to appre-
ciate that the more effectively the pro-
cess works the more efficient will be
the country’s economic performance on
which everybody’s standard of living
depends. That this is generally recog-
nised these days is all to the good.
People in the thickest part of the fray,
even company chairmen, are more ex-
pansive about their role, some being
inclined to enjoy an inflation of their
public image in the process. Even solid
citizens like Sir Lindesay Clark, chair-
man of Western Mining, who in the
old days used to hide his light under a
pile of Toorak bushels, can these days
tell a Press conference with the utmost
candor that profits are his business (as
if we didn’t know).
For those who regard the recent
money-making in minerals shares some-
what jealously, there are compensations
in taking a philosophical approach.
Nobody can deny that in the national
interest most people would prefer to
see capital supplies going into the most
productive uses. This is not because,
simply, certain people will make more
profits, but more because our richest
natural resources will be developed to
the country’s best advantage this way,
and not by everybody hanging around
while the life companies decide to
change their investment habits in the
light of such modern concepts as cost/
benefit analysis and capital flows. West-
ern Mining will get all the Australian
capital it wants through the time-
honored method of the establishment
of mammoth premiums on its shares
through the normal play of market
forces and share splitting, with the
stock exchanges’ excalators and com-
puters running hot in Sir Lindesay’s
cause. Nobody like, say, a board mem-
ber of the AMP, the Arbitration Com-
mission justices, Albert Monk, or even,
for that matter, Harold Wilson and
Roy Jenkins (who’ve obliged the Lon-
don end of WMC’s capital raising exer-
cise) are going to cause Sir Lindesay
any loss of sleep.
Nor, for that matter, are any of
these gentlemen likely to be keeping
Sir Colin Syme and his fellow BHP
board members awake at nights as they
approach the new rounds of capital
raising for the group’s oil and natural-
gas projects. They know better than
anybody that there’ll be a rush to come
to their funds-raising party.
For the moment one’s more objective
thoughts are less with the elite like
WMC, BHP, and the rest (well able
to look after themselves) and more
with industrial companies which, per-
haps through no fault of their own,
are going through dog days on the
stock exchanges, most of them with
Kelly’s chance of whetting investors’
appetites to the point of subscribing
to new capital issues. However, it isn’t
only sad for such companies as these.
One also has to think of the impli-
cations of this neglect for the economy.
If some of the imponderables stem-
ming from this neglect seem to come
from the overall inadequacy of capital
in sight to do everything we want in
development (not to speak of the
enormous claims of defence on capital
supplies) others seem to stem from in-
ternal pressures quite outside the heavy
demands on capital for minerals de-
velopment.
Mr. Monk may not be causing the
minerals knights any wakeful hours,
but the conjuncture of ACTU and
Arbitration Commission forces is play-
ing merry hell with the prices of en-
gineering shares on the stock exchanges.
Look at it this way. If these companies
fail to get the long-term capital they
need to expand or even to maintain
their operations, we are going to see
some very awkward twists in the in-
dustrial structure, twists which could
well make a mockery of pious decisions
to award wages to workers far in ad-
vance of their contributions to produc-
tivity, measured in national accounting
or particular industry terms, or how
you will.
To put it at its bluntest, the invest-
ment image of Australian public com-
panies engaged primarily in metal
working (that is, without mineral at-
tachments like BHP) is currently the
worst it has been since the war. In
the case of McPhersons, whose shares
are almost back to par after being more
than two and a half times par some
years ago, no underwriter would risk
his reputation in backing a new issue of
capital, and it would be hard to dress
up an issue in sufficiently attractive
terms to get shareholders to subscribe
to one. This throws the expansion pos-
sibilities for such companies back on
their cash flows and reserves, which in
the latter case are already mostly
absorbed in their businesses. Few of
them would have much chance of find-
ing sufficient funds for expansion from
cash flows if their profitability were
further eroded to the extent envisaged
if they cannot absorb the new Arbitra-
tion Commission awards in present
over-award payments.
Yet it is on the metal working in-
dustries more than any other that we
are relying for the absorption of immi-
grant labor and, so, for the rapid ex-
pansion of the population and the
economy in general. It would be all
right if we were prepared to scrap our
pretensions of becoming a great in-
dustrial country or even if we were
prepared to see the whole price struc-
ture lifted to an extent which would
force us to devalue. But are we? Or
do we mind if the diversion of capi-
tal into minerals to the neglect of the
present industrial growth-pattern results
in Australia becoming a giant quarry
for the benefit, mostly, of wealthy
local and overseas interests?

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
The sweet clang
of mining
equipment in W.A.
THE “BUY ME SOMETHING FAST”
which has enlivened trading opera-
tions pretty well since the year be-
gan now seems to have changed to
“Do you think I should buy, and if so
what?” Traders, except for a very
occasional good old - fashioned - style
bullish-type outburst, are being notice-
ably more selective, quicker at taking
profits, and more content with smaller
gains. They are, no doubt, wondering
when and if the mining bubble will
burst—and if the U.K.’s new “horror”
Budget will be the pin that does it.
Overseas portfolio investment is one of
the very few areas which still allows a
sterling outflow from England. It is
probably a good 50/50 bet that Mr.
Wilson will plug it. Regardless, how-
ever, of whether he does or he doesn’t
there is a good possibility of a last-
minute panic-buying spree with large
quantities of funds flooding into Austra-
lia a few days before Budget day (there
almost always is in cases like this). But
just what happens after March 19
is anyone’s guess. If the Pommies aren’t
allowed to invest out here any more it
seems probable that the market will
ease back with the sulks (not to men-
tion lack of buying support). If there
is no imposition of restrictions it seems
equally probable that there will be a
bit of an ease-up anyhow. With the
pressure off, British investors will prob-
ably take a breather and consider their
next step before taking it. Either way
it seems a reaction of some type can
be expected. It will be well worth-
while remembering what the Boy Scouts
say ...
While on cliches (and I’m constantly
accused of this), here’s one more. It’s
one I’ve been plugging for quite some
time—“Go West young man, go West.”
I harp on this one because it seems to
me that the clang of the mining equip-
ment disturbing the quiet wastes
(there’s a paradox) of Western Austra-
lia will soon be echoed in the tills of
shrewd investors right around the con-
tinent. The mining giants that are
transforming the West are also
creating an unprecedented boom in
many of Western Australia’s listed
companies, particularly those making or
distributing industrial machinery. Wig-
mores Ltd. is one of these.
This company is a Perth-based dis-
tributor of agricultural machinery,
earth-moving equipment, and Cater-
pillar tractors. Its record has been
impressive. Since 1961 its earning rate
has increased from 28 percent to 38.2
percent. Last year it earned $775,000,
a record which covered the company’s
15 percent dividend 2.5 times over. At
$4.30, around $1 below the last year’s
high, the company looks good value
(especially since prospects are much
better than a year ago). I bought 300.
Another company that looks good to
me despite the uncertainty of the min-
ing market is the recently listed Mining
Traders Ltd. This company appeals
simply because of the wide and proven
experience of its directors, all well-in-
formed men and extremely well placed
to take advantage of any situations
offering (either crashes or booms) in
the mining market. They are Mr. K. H.
McMahon (the well-regarded mining
consultant and a director of several
mining companies), Mr. M. R. L. Dowl-
ing (a director of Kathleen Investments
and a partner of the Sydney stockbrok-
ing firm Patrick & Co.), Mr. J. S.
Millner (a director of Australian Oil
and Gas Corporation and the Washing-
ton H. Soul Group), and Mr. J. E.
Roberts (an accountant and director of
Pioneer Concrete, Kathleen Invest-
ments, Rutile and Zircon Mines (New-
castle), and Coff’s Harbor Rutile).
This week I decided to do what the
rest of the market is doing with its
mining shares. I sold off my Amalga-
mated Petroleum after a holding of only
one week and after a rise of only 2
cents. The deal yielded a profit of
$lB6, so I can’t really complain. I
can’t complain either about the CBA’s
offer to take over my holding in General
Credits at a figure which will probably
be around 90 cents (they cost me only
71 cents).

IS IT JUST bad luck that diversi-
fications go so poorly with British
Tobacco, while things go so much
better with other soft-drink makers,
other packaging companies, other ice-
cream makers—and are even showing
signs of improvement for other pastora-
lists, and frozen food producers? The
latest annual report from British
Tobacco is a disappointing document,
with the promise of further gloom (at
least in the accounts) once the sorry
matter of Sou-West Frozen Food
Packers is settled in the courts.
Apart from the higher cigarette pro-
f
fit that was the only reason for the

earnings for the year to last October

there was little to cheer about. And
even m cigarettes the company is
worried about health attacks and still
protests, ostrich-like, that there is no
satisfactory scientific proof of a con-
nection between smoking and health,”
while it spends more and more earn-
ing less and less from its non-smoking
operations.
But things may not be as gloomy as
they seem for British Tobacco—nor as
bad as the market fears in marking the
shares down from last year’s peak of
$2.92 to $2.38. Admittedly this is
what we quite wrongly said last year
when there seemed every indication
that the company’s unfortunate diver-
sifications away from smoking would
soon pay off. But the fact that they
have still failed to do so does not
mean that they never will, even if this
y ea f’ s |*dy improvement will be held
back a bit by special problems caused by

that surprisingly did badly )ast year
(profit remained “satisfactory,” which
j s a p OOJ - result at a time when other
companies were increasing their profits)
are expected to do a lot better this
year, despite the slowdown in paper-
board usage, because of administrative
improvements and the fact that a
greater proportion of the profits will
remain within the group.
Directors expect the soft-drink divi-
sion to show the benefits of last year’s
considerable spending on new-product
promotion, particularly following last
July’s price rise. Frankly, they will
need a lot of luck to win the battle
for “mixer” drinks they set off with
Schweppes last year, but their cans and
screw-top bottles in the Shelleys line
could help restore at least Shelleys’
profit which fell last year by almost
19 percent for the first time ever.
Snack foods are clearly doing better.
Hard ice-cream looks set for improve-
ments, as the ice-cream price war has
definitely ended (largely because
British Tobacco took over so many of
the contestants!), and soft ice-cream
\Yill no longer be a drain on profits this
year, following the massive losses of
income and capital resulting from the
Dairy Frost disaster; mobile distribution
has now ended.
The poultry business should bring in
higher returns this year, but there will
still be substantial losses in the frozen
foods section unless something unex-
pected happens. And it could. There
seems little doubt that this industry
needs further rationalising; judging by
British Tobacco’s past form, there seems
every indication that acquisition of the
Petersville group would be a conceiv-
able way that British Tobacco could
solve its problems in this area. Peters-
ville’s poorer result suggests that some-
thing needs to be done there, too.
IF THE LEVEL of optioh activity is
any guide, then there is still a boom
psychology around despite the market’s
uneasiness. Last week about 60,000 call
options were taken out on Longreach
Oil, most of them requiring its shares
to go up to 95 cents before the buyer
breaks even, let alone getting any profit.
Now that prices had fallen to 73 cents
by the weekend, the attractions of a
modest speculation in the options mar-
ket to follow this lead at much cheaper
prices are fairly high. This latest batch
of Longreach options follows a sub-
stantial number written a month or so
ago. Someone is very confident indeed
about this stock.
Another oil stock that has been
strongly sought in the options market
lately is Oil Search, whose attractions
are strictly petroliferous, while Long-
reach’s are metallic. Last week’s volu-
minous buying of Oil Search shares
was accompanied by more options buy-
ing (about 3000, which is relatively
modest compared with the huge num-
The Chartist says:
MT. LYELL MINING & RAILWAY could be an interesting situation for investors
in view of recent market action and in relation to the strong rise in the LME
copper price. This stock has not been a good trendline study since 1964 although
at times quite fast intermediate rates of appreciation have been achieved. The
consolidation pattern formed during the area of trading in 1965 and 1967 suggests
that price could move up to a first target of $2.70 and a higher one about $3.60
in the short to medium term. Any price rise above the recent breakout price at
$2.10 on high volume would indicate that the targets could ultimately be achieved.

bers written earlier this year. The big
problem about Oil Search shares is that
everyone and his dog seems to “know”
that there is oil in the Phillips drill
hole going into a structure which
extends well into the adjacent Oil
Search tenement.
When the news about these oil
sands is eventually released, there will
probably be few investors around who
haven’t already heard about it and
already bought their shares. Neverthe-
less, if the rumors turn out to be fact,
Oil Search shares could well be worth
closer to $2 than $l, which would be
a nice profit for those who paid 11
cents only a year or so ago.
Other stocks that featured in last
week’s options trading were Cleveland
Tin, Hill 50, Peko, Ravenshoe (which
has been attracting a bit of attention
in recent weeks), Thiess (whose market
downturn has been accompanied by
some expensive options buying as
someone clearly disagrees with the mar-
ket), Hamersley, Great Boulder, and,
as usual, BHP. There has also been
some interest in the Planet group.
LAST WEEK’S 16 percent fall in
mining shares still leaves many stocks
in a very vulnerable position. There is
a big collection of companies with no
other assets than a head office and
high hopes that have been kept boom-
ing by whispering campaigns, by the
promise of big news soon to hit the
market. Well now it’s money up or
shut up. Unless the news comes pretty
quickly and is pretty good, these stocks
are destined to return to the obscurity
from which they so recently emerged.
But the big stocks that actually do
have workable deposits of the new
booming metals should not be too vul-
nerable, always remembering that a $1
fall in BHP sounds bigger than a 5-
cent fall in Planet Oil but that they
both represent the same proportion.
There is no doubt that just as the
greatest proportionate rises come from
the little stocks, so will the falls.
The bigger mining companies have
some measure of insulation not only
because a far greater proportion of
their shareholders are real investors
rather than speculators ready to get out
quick but they also have the resources to
keep coming out with -good news, like
WMC and BHP last week; they do
have something below the surface.
The result of last week’s decline in
minerals was that the non-ferrous min-
ing section of the Sydney Index lost
nearly all its 1968 rise, settling down to
within 2 percent of its end of Decem-
ber level.
But for the rest of the market the
situation looks more satisfactory right
now. The only section of the index
down so far in 1968 is building and
construction, which has already fallen
six percent to take some of the gilt off
last year’s increase. The best rise has
come from the fuel, light, and power
section, which has risen 18 percent and
has gone most of the way toward re-
covering last year’s fall. Other finance
and transport have continued to do
well and textiles have recovered a bit
of last year’s losses, as generally good
interim results have come from the big
cotton companies.
But these rises were not the only
reason for the 6 percent lift in the
Sydney share price index. Clearly, the
index is dominated by BHP; when
BHP smiles, the index smiles. The 20
percent lift in the steel and engineering
section since December is BHP, and
it provided a fair proportion of the
rise in the all ordinaries index.
Whether the continuing good oil
news from BHP will be able to hold
the index up if a general market fall
develops, as some observers expect (but
mainly in mining), is yet to be seen.
The accompanying table of share
prices which up-dates a similar table
appearing on this page in the Jan-
uary 6 issue also corrects some mistakes
appearing at that time, particularly in
the pastoral and trade and services
groups.

The Melbourne market
Playing it safe
and cautious
THE MARKET’S IN a highly sensi-
tive state with everybody telling every-
body to keep some cash up the sleeve
for the critical British Budget day when
Mr. Roy Jenkins cries “enough” to
those British who’ve been leading the
Australian market for so long. No need
to look far for the hour-to-hour trend-
setters. The office boy from Potters
tells his girlfriend in the now oh so
plush lounge of the Mitre how he sold
his North Kals at the top, has been in
and out of Metals Ex and VAM, and
she, capping his chat: “I’m sticking
with my Boulders!” Or is it the
shadowy figure walking at twilight in
the Domain muttering to himself, “If
I sell my Greensbushes at 30 I’ll net
300!” The man on a South Yarra pave-
ment (his dog sniffing yours) saying,
“I’m sure Phillips have got it; I’m
going to float a copper show with 40
percent lead, and what about Loloma!”
These are the hourly trendsetters.
But the oracle of Capel Court is still
working, too. In fact, last Monday we
thought we heard a ghost, but it turned
out to be a former finance editor of
The Bulletin peering through the shades
at the Haliburton Investment meeting
where Mr. “Cam” Johnston was
striking the familiar cautionary notes
in no less stentorian a fashion as his pre-
decessor, notes such as: “Indiscriminate
investment, particularly in mining
stocks, which have yet to offer more
than speculative promise, is usually un-
wise and appears particularly so at this
time.” He is as strongly for the selective
attractions of solid stocks and the con-
vertible note as Mr. Ricketson was. So,
in their former direction, will be the
investment departments of the institu-
tions, who, if their top men are not to
be seen in the Mitre bar or “reinvest-
ing” profits at the TAB, will, from their
ivory towers, continue to decide the
ultimate trend of markets.
Macpherson’s 12.3 percent profit lift
in the past half year puts a better com-
plexion on the $2.00 shares, which, even
in the face of the Arbitration’s decision
to make 70 percent of the recent work-
values award payable immediately,
made good headway from their all-time
low of $2.34 to $2.50 during the week.
However, as the higher wages will have
to be paid retrospectively to January
22, it is anybody’s guess whether the
profit improvement in the first half
will be maintained in the second. Per-
haps it would be safer to assume that
last year’s 1.6 times cover for the
8 l-3rd percent dividend (a rate held
since the one-for-two bonus issue was
made in 1961) won’t be much im-
proved on for the full year. At best
one could possibly expect earnings to
get back to the level of two years ago,

that is, 14.4 percent, from which they
dropped to 13.5 last year.
Although the shares have recently
been regarded around the market as in
line for a recovery, the nearer they re-
treated to par (remember they are $2
shares) the big metal trades wage slug
could call for a reassessment of the
possibilities. The position looks pretty
open and future profits could well hinge
on how effective the company’s reorgan-
isation of its activities into profit
centres —along the same lines as
adopted last year by BHP—proves to
be and how rapidly it can be effected.
That some progress has been made in
this direction was obvious from the
chairman’s remarks at last year’s annual
meeting, but with plants and merchan-
dising scattered so widely in various
parts of the Commonwealth and new
ones continuing to be added the full job
would seem to be a herculean task.
Another engineer, Turner Industries,
based at Nunawading, has also been
under cloud this last year or more and,
unhappily, it shows no signs of break-
ing. What this company wants most is
for heavy rain to set in, and stay in, so
that people will have a use for its motor
mowers. As there is hardly any grass
left in Victoria and not much in South
Australia, the company’s sales have
dropped precipitously, not only of
motor mowers and mower services but,
to a lesser extent, of cabinet hardware.
Even though the drought’s full effects
were not felt on sales until the end of
October and don’t look to have fallen
all that much—by $200,000 or so from
$4.2 million —net profit for the half
year to end December was cut from
$185,000 to a mere $65,000 (plus an
unexpected rebate of $35,000 not yet
taken into account relating to 1966-67).
Obviously, as the company says, per
unit overheads have weighed heavily
on net profit, and it also complains of
rising labor costs.
It has to start raining sometime
around here, but the darkest hour
before the dawn is going to be a long
one for Turner’s, because a decent
deluge is not expected until May. If,
in the interim, Turner shares could go
down even further from their present
lowly 23 cents (50-cent shares) it might
be an idea to put a few of them away
for a rainy day, so to speak. According
to the inflated stocks position there
appear to be plenty of mowers on hand
for such an event (with, of course, cor-
respondingly increased current liabili-
ties to match).
One of the few brokers one' found
with a second or two to spare from
his minerals-happy clients mentioned
that Victoria Insurance, now yielding
3.6 percent on dividend and 4.2 percent
on earnings at the current price of
$3.45, and Schweppes at $1.63 yielding
even less (3.3 percent) on dividend
and 5.2 percent on earnings, were both
overpriced. But he couldn’t stay long
enough to say why. On the other
hand, there were a couple considered
to be cheap at current prices. One is
John Mcllwraith Industries, whose 50-
cent shares give the excellent dividend
yield of 7.9 percent and an earnings
yield of 10.8 percent at the ruling
price of 95 cents (they’ve been up to
$1.05 this year). The other stock is
Rocke Tompsitt, the pharmaceuticals
manufacturer and wholesaler, whose 50-
cent shares (now 6 cents off the year’s
low at 66c) offer 7.6 percent on divid-
end and a 12.8 percent earnings yield.
Even accepting the jaundiced view
that all that glitters (be it in the way
of dividend or earnings yields) is not
necessarily gold, there would seem to
be a good case for switching out of
both the former low-yielders into John
Mcllwraith. But considering what hap-
pened to Drug Houses of Australia’s
profits recently and the various pres-
sures operating to squeeze the pharma-
ceutical industry in the interest of
keeping down the national drug bill it
might be advisable to steer clear of
Rocke Tompsitt, even at its present
price, until the air clears a bit. Anyway,
even if Rocke Tompsitt has a good
record of profit increase, year by year
you almost need a microscope to see
them.


Behind the balance sheets
J. Fielding: a stock with an
embarrassment of riches
IT LOOKS LIKE a pretty good re-
covery over the past 12 months, the
$1.30 improvement to $5 in the price
of shares in J. Fielding and Co. Ltd.,
the packaging maker cum investor.
But, in effect, this did little more than
reflect the $1 a share rise in the value
of Fielding’s holding (which it pre-
sumably still has) of 225,000 shares
in BHP during that time. And no
doubt the remaining 30 cents of the
rise is largely accounted for by in-
creases in value of the other shares,
particularly CRA and Hamersley, held
in Fielding’s massive $9 million-odd
investment portfolio.
For by now the bulk of Fielding’s
assets are tied up in investments and
rental properties, which are bringing
in close to half its net profits. Its own
packaging operations only account for
about 15 percent of the group’s net
assets (on the current market value of
its share portfolio and on the basis
that its balance sheet liabilities are
overwhelmingly related to its manufac-
turing rather than its investment
activities). And the company’s holdings
in various associated fibre container
makers around Australia only lift the
proportion of its net assets involved
in packaging to less than 20 percent.
So it is sensible that the price of
Fielding’s shares should have responded
so significantly to changes in the value
of the share portfolio that now provides
probably 70 percent (at today’s market)
of the value of Fielding’s net assets
although the book value of its rental
properties, which now make up about
eight percent of net assets, appears to
understate their market value very
substantially indeed, and so these pro-
perties are far more important to Field-
ing’s than they appear.
But so far the market does not
appear to have taken into account the
fact that Fielding’s is doing quite well
out of its packaging business, too.
There seems little likelihood that New
Zealand’s devaluation or the extension
of the New Zealand-Australia Trade
Agreement, or the battle between APM
and Tasman Pulp over liner-board will
do the company any harm at all; these
could even do it quite a bit of good
by reducing the cost of some of its
raw materials without in reality making
the company any more vulnerable to
New Zealand competition.
In any event, there has been a 40
percent increase in profits from the
group’s own packaging operations over
the past three years (which compares
fairly well with the 34 percent increase
in Australian paperboard production
during the same period). This year,
packaging has not been so buoyant,
with paperboard production up only
about five percent in the first period
of the year and with directors of
Fielding’s reporting merely that aggre-
gate sales from manufacturing sources
were “maintained” in the December
half-year and that manufacturing
profits were equal with those of the
previous corresponding period.
This slowdown in the growth of
manufacturing profits will not prevent
Fielding’s from coming out with another
record profit this year, as “income from
sources outside the group” showed an
increase that was “satisfactory” (which
probably means fairly large, in this
company). So directors have increased
the interim dividend to indicate an
annual rate of 18 percent, which will
take about $480,000 but probably still
leave another $400,000 or so in retained
profits, the bulk of which will go into
the investment portfolio, if last year is
any guide (the company spent $460,000
on shares in 1966-67).
This continual buying of shares natur-
ally results in rising tax-free investment
income, which, from listed investments
alone, last year made up more than a
quarter of the net profit of $884,500
(and the unlisted investments appear
to return a healthy dividend, too). In
keeping with Fielding’s conservative
return, tax looks high in relation to
taxable income, suggesting that some
non-deductible items, like the $13,000
a year depreciation on buildings last
year, are, in fact, deducted.
Fielding’s is not doing much about
expanding its packaging operations, on
which it spent only about $50,000 last
year, mainly in extensions to the Kings-
grove factory by adding about 16,000
feet of floor space. It has been coping
with increasing sales out of existing
capacity, for the industry went through
a difficult period a few years ago when
it expanded well ahead of demand, with
the result that there was severe price
competition, particularly from newer
groups trying to establish their position.
But these are now willing to go along
with the general “understanding” on
prices in the fibre packaging industry,
which is a factor in the greater
“stability” in the industry in the latest
year noted by the chairman, Mr. L. T.
Fielding.
There is significant scope for greater
efficiency (and higher profits) in the
industry, however. Like its competitors,
Fielding’s plants at Kingsgrove, the con-
tainer division (Fielding Industries Pty.
Ltd.), and the carton, printing, and box
divisions (Jayfield Pty. Ltd.,) operate
on a one-shift basis only, plus overtime.
Overseas, most container plants run
on three shifts, with maximum use of
plant facilities.
Fielding’s plants have been all at
Kingsgrove since December, 1961. The
land (15 acres) was bought in 1954,
and appears to have multiplied six-fold
in value. The company is using approx-
imately two-thirds of the area. Re-
valuation of the freehold in the latest
financial year, to the Valuer-General’s
1962 valuation, put $290,000 more on
the freehold property, permitting a one-
for-ten bonus to shareholders as at last
October, making the eighth bonus since
the 1932 par issue.
There are plenty of reserves avail-
able for another bonus. Last year the
company transferred $673,527 surplus
on realisation of shares and properties
since 1920 from general reserve to capi-
tal profits reserve.
The company’s embarrassment of
riches dates back to the founding Field-
ing, who was successful with tin share
investments in the first war years. Since
then, a huge share portfolio of listed
investments has been amassed whose
book value of s3.Bm. is more than
double the $1,864,000 fixed assets in-
volved in the company’s own manufac-
turing, and whose current market value
is probably more than five times as
large. J. Fielding’s rental properties,
shown in the books at cost of
$1,081,000, are made up of a couple
of oldish city office blocks and about
a dozen residential blocks,
The company looks for an overall re-
turn of cost of these of 10 percent
after land tax, and is always on the
look-out for properties. Exceot for a
couple of suburban blocks (built in
Petersham) all these properties were
bought pre-war, and as more than half
are rent-controlled the return is not as
good as it could be, but the blocks are
well maintained, and their market value
would be, with vacant possession,
several times book value. (A subsidiary,
Hendron Pty. Ltd., does maintenance
of the buildings and general contract-
ing for outsiders.)
In addition, Fielding’s has another
$BO,OOO in bonds, $664,000 in fixed
deposits, debentures, and loans on
mortgage and $476,000 in unlisted com-

CLEAN vs. SMUT
It is a fact that ten years ago, before the emergence of the great Australian Aff-
luence, people and places really did look cleaner. Today, our beaches, highways, parks
and populace appear to be on the losing end of the battle for cleanliness. But not
our office buildings. Certainly not office buildings that are cleaned and cared for by
Crothall. They wage a battle against dust, dirt and grime that is never ending. And
they are winning. Crothall people, Crothall materials and the Crothall system of
cleaning is a combination that cannot be beaten. For premium quality cleaning service

panics, which is made up of a 50 per-
cent interest (jointly with Sands and
McDougalls) in Corrugated Fibre Con-
tainers Pty. Ltd., with a corrugated
and solid fibre plant at Sunshine, Vic-
toria, on 16 acres of land which, in
turn, has a half interest in Fibreboard
Containers Ltd. of Adelaide, also mak-
ing corrugated and solid fibre contain-
ers. The value of Fielding’s investment
in these associates is clearly greater than
that shown in the books.
Fielding also has a 20 percent interest
in Tasmanian Containers Pty. Ltd. of
Launceston, giving it, like so many
others in the field, interests in several
States, so there is almost no interstate
competition. Freight and the time
element almost prohibit manufacturing
in one State for delivery in another.
Likewise, New Zealand packagers pre-
sent no threat to Australian packagers,
notwithstanding the New Zealand de-
valuation, the introduction of roll-on,
roll-off shipping facilities in three years’
time, and the Australia-New Zealand
Free Trade agreement.
Glimpses of the huge inner reserves
(probably making it worth as much as
$8 a share) make the company attrac-
tive takeover bait, but management
feels it pretty much has effective con-
trol, so long as dividends are high,
bonuses regular, and the investments
seem well handled. For there is every
prospect that Fielding’s will continue to
be at least as rewarding a stock in the
future as it has been in the past. The
purchaser of 100 £1 shares ten years
ago would today hold 390 $1 shares
if he had taken up his entitlements,
showing a doubling of his, original in-
vestment in market value, with a 70
percent improvement in annual income.
The company will have no difficulty in
maintaining the present 18 percent
annual dividend, four-fifths of which
could be provided by investment income
alone. This is a solid stock.

Security analysis
United Packages: growing pains
in a lively industry
GLANCING THROUGH the “Modern
Packaging Encyclopedia” (published
by McGraw Hill Inc.) one cannot fail
to be impressed by the ingenuity of the
modern packaging industry.
The packaging industry is now very
big business and accounts for about 2
percent of Australia’s gross national
product. So big is the packaging in-
dustry’s appetite for raw materials that
in the U.S. it consumes 96 percent of
the annual output of glass (except flat
glass), 50 percent of paper and paper-
board, 20 percent of plastics, 10 percent
of timber, and 8 percent of steel and
aluminium. The U.S. leads the world in
both the overall volume of production
and in the rate of consumption per head
of population. Packaging materials rate
of production per head of population in
the U.S. averages about 5001 b. a year
with a value of about SA9O.
In Australia, the production of
packaging materials on a per capita
basis is equivalent to about 40-45 per-
cent of the U.S. rate. The actual
consumption rate would be much lower
again, however, because about 55 per-
cent of Australia’s foodstuffs are ex-
ported, and these absorb a considerable
volume of the packaging materials pro-
duced in Australia. Foodstuffs remain
the largest single user of packaging
materials throughout the world.
According to a widely quoted source,
the current composition of packaging
materials produced in Australia shows
paper products as holding 39.4 per-
cent of the market, metal 25.2 per-
cent, textiles 9.4 percent, plastics 9.1
percent, glass 8.1 percent, wood 5.5
percent, and others (the supporting
items of closures, cushioning materials,
labels, tapes, tags, adhesives, twine)
3.3 percent. The overall annual rate
of growth appears to be at about 6-8
percent, with paper and glass at about
8 percent, plastics at about 20 percent
(but approaching 30 percent in some
specific product areas), metal at about
4 percent, wood at a static rate, and
textiles showing an absolute decline.
If we follow U.S. trends, we will see
paper increasing its shares of the over-
all packaging market to, say, about 45
percent (that is up by about 5 per-
cent on the current level), while
textiles will fall away heavily (in the
U.S. textiles account for only 1 per-
cent of the total packaging volume).
Metal, glass, and plastics on U.S. trends
will retain their approximate current
shares of the overall packaging market.
United Packages Ltd. impresses me
as the company with possibly the
greatest immediate potential in this
most alert and alive industry. The
name United Packages is new and
was only adopted in July, 1967, but
under its original name, Queensland
Can Co., the company has been in
business since 1921 and has been a
listed public company for almost 39
years —the company is listed on the
stock markets in Brisbane and Mel-
bourne and will shortly make its debut
in Sydney. United Packages is a more
appropriate name for the company, for,
despite its Queensland origins, up to
45 percent of the company’s sales
volume is derived outside the State
borders. Moreover, far from the need
to emphasise the original metal-can
side of the business in the company’s
title, my information is that paper
packaging now represents 60 percent
of the total turnover composition, com-
pared to 30 percent in metal and 10
percent in plastics.
Metal cans dominated the company’s
business until the late 19405, although
there had been a measure of diversifica-
tion in paper packaging and printing.
In 1948, total assets amounted to
$960,368, pre-tax profit to $85,198 and
Earned for Ordinary to $67,372. Over
the past 20 years, shareholders were to
see the company’s total assets increasing
by 19.2 times, pre-tax profit rising by
15.7 times, and Earned for Ordinary by
14.3 times. Over the same period, turn-
over is said to have increased by about
18 times. This is very rapid growth by
Australian standards.
The main element of growth came
in 1961 with the acquisition of the
listed Melbourne company Paper and
Board Industries Ltd. This gave the
company access to factories in Victoria,
South Australia, and Western Australia.
In 1968 the group operates 15 factories
with a total floor space of 1,200,000 sq.
ft. There are six factories in Brisbane
(Rocklea, West End, New Farm, Moo-
rooka, Yeerongpilly, and Darra) and
other plants are at Townsville and
Rockhampton (Qld.), Huntingdale
(Melbourne), Mildura (Vic.), Berri
(S.A.), O’Connor (Perth), and Bridge-
town (W.A.). Sales offices exist at all
these centres and also in Sydney.
The company is in the forefront of
new technical breakthroughs in the in-
dustry. For example, it was one of the
first to commercially produce and
market the PVC bottle, which is shat-
terproof, as clear as glass, and only
1-16th its weight. In Europe, where the
technical development in this product
area is most advanced, PVC bottles are
being used to package cooking oils, in-
stant coffee, cocoa, cordials, even wine,
and there is a possible breakthrough
■ into carbonated soft-drinks under de-
velopment.
In paper packaging the company is
one of the three largest producers in
Australia of corrugated containers, and
also manufactures folding paper boxes
and set-up paper boxes. Corrugated
containers are by far the principal type
of paper and paperboard containers
produced in the world, for it is claimed
that they can be made rigid and strong
enough to ship a refrigerator, flexible
enough to wrap around a lead pencil,
and can be fashioned into virtually any
size or shape. Ten years ago Australian
production of corrugated containers was
only one-fifth of the U.S. rate on a
per head of population basis, while
today it is two-fifths. United Packages
have just installed an 87in. Langston
Masson corrugator machine, at a cost
of about $500,000. This machine is one
of the widest and fastest corrugators in
Australia and is capable of producing
4550 sq. ft. of container material a
minute, comparing favorably with the
most modern in the world. If fully
operating on a continuous basis, 24
hours a day, 7 days a week, this
machine could produce up to 25 per-
cent of Australia’s current demand for
corrugated containers.
One new phase of the company’s
business which shows promise is in the
production of PVC sheets, pipes, and
fittings. Plastics are giving metal, con-
crete, and earthenware a run for their
money in stormwater fittings and in
general piping and fittings. Vinlon Pty.
Ltd., a company in which United
Packages acquired a one-third interest
in 1964, became a wholly owned sub-
sidiary in July, 1967. PVC sheets,
pipes, and fittings already account for
five percent of United Packages’ group-
turnover, and the company conserva-
tively estimates an annual rate of
growth of 25 percent from this activity.

The company has been showing
signs of growing pains over the past
few years, with assets increasing at
about double the rate of profit growth,
as is shown in the company statistics for
the 1963-1967 period in the table above.
Packaging is a very capital-hungry
industry, but shareholders who are
patient should find this stock reward-
ing. The industry whisper is that the
company is poised for a buoyant era in
profit growth.
At $1.26, the shares command a
dividend yield of 4.4 percent and the
price earnings multiple is 14.1. I would
buy at this price.

Difficulties and potentials in
the exploitation of natural gas
INVESTORS have sometimes been
described as disappointed speculators.
Such a description carries with it the
implication that immediate and per-
haps lesser rewards are worth more
than a steady, but long delayed sure
thing. This seems to have been the
case at least as far as petroleum ex-
ploration in Australia has been con-
cerned. As pointed out in a very com-
prehensive survey on natural gas con-
tained in the latest issue of the Bureau
of Mineral Resources Quarterly Re-
view of the Australian mineral indus-
try, the discovery of deposits of natural
gas in Australia has been incidental
to the search for oil, and has been
largely considered to be of inferior
economic importance. The companies
which in fact have been the most ener-
getic seekers for oil have had con-
siderably more success in discovering
accumulations of natural gas than they
have had in finding oil reservoirs.
For the most part, circumstances
have forced these companies to dis-
regard their deposits of gas and con-
tinue looking for an oil flow from
which to make their fortunes. For as
the article mentioned above points out,
it has only been in the past few years
that sufficient progress has been made
in the fields of land and ocean trans-
mission, liquefaction, and petro-
chemistry, for natural gas to be no
longer an embarrassment to its dis-
coverers in Australia that is, as gas
has been exploited for many years over-
seas, particularly in Canada and the
U.S.
The major obstacle to exploiting
local deposits of gas has been the
finance required for the construction
of pipelines from otherwise viable de-
posits found in Central Australia and
Queensland. In the local market for
developmental finance in the past few
years, there have been many much
more attractive ventures and the rate
of return required from local investors
has been too high for the' economics of
natural gas exploitation, an essential
ingredient of which is cheap finance
due to the prices of other fuels. Many
of the earlier pipeline companies in
Canada were able to obtain public
money by way of debentures offering
rates as low as 3 \ percent.
Here in Australia, it has been neces-
sary to obtain Government finance for
the construction of pipelines from our
two biggest deposits of gas, while oil
pipelines have been able to pay for
finance from private sources. The gas
pipeline to be built by the Associated
Group of oil companies is an exception,
being financed by the group itself
jointly with the Southern Union Gas
Company of Dallas, Texas. In this
case the difference between the more
immediate reward of an oilfield and the
long-term income from the pipeline
is heightened by the fact that the Asso-
ciated Group does not expect to re-
ceive any return from sales of its
gas for at least eight years, although
the actual pipeline company will re-
ceive sufficient income in managerial
fees to pay dividends to the two com-
panies.
It is a fact of life that to obtain
large quantities of developmental
capital at reasonable cost, future de-
mand must be established for the
mineral to be extracted. This assurance
is looked for in the form of long-term
contracts for supply and there is little
doubt that our iron-ore deposits would
have remained untouched without the
contracts obtained for supply from
Hamersley, Mount Goldsworthy, and
Mount Newman. This is perhaps an
even larger consideration in the fin-
ancing of pipelines for natural gas as
the servicing charges must necessarily
be lower as a result of the strong com-
petition it faces from other types of
fuel such as oil, coal, and hydro-
electricity.
At the present time the outlook for
natural gas as a feedstock for chemical
plants in Australia is even more pro-
scribed. Surplus capacity exists at most
chemical complexes and the by-products
of petrol refineries are already widely
used by chemical plants situated in the
main industrial centres.
In spite of the difficulties imposed
by distances and competition from other
types of fuel, the development of
natural gas deposits in Australia has
proceeded at a good pace. It was only
three years ago that Santos obtained
large gas flows from its Gidgealpa and
Moomba fields and BHP’s first off-shore
well was sunk only a couple of years
ago.
Both of these companies have now
obtained customers for their gas and
both are expected to be delivering to
Adelaide and Melbourne respectively
by the middle of next year. The Asso-
ciated Group has taken much longer
to obtain customers for its gas but by
next year it, too, will be piping gas
to metropolitan Brisbane.
Apart from these large deposits,
other accumulations of natural gas
have been proved to exist at Mereenie
and Palm Valley, both near Alice
Springs, and in the western coastal area
of Papua, in areas drilled by Oil Search
in 1956, 1958, and 1960. The well
currently being drilled by Phillips
Petroleum in the Gulf of Papua, a
few miles offshore, has also indicated
the presence of sizable quantities of
gas. So far the deposits on the mainland
of Australia have won out on the score
of distance from market, but the very-
high flow rates encountered in Papua
could well mean a revision of the com-
mercial possibilities of gas from
deposits encountered by Oil Search and
Phillips.
Santos’ Gidgealpa field contains wells
which, on an open flow potential were
calculated to be capable of producing
29.5 million cubic feet per day, 23.2
million cubic feet per day, and 82 mil-
lion cubic feet per day in three wells;
the Mereenie field contains wells which
had an open flow potential of up to
60 million cubic feet per day; and
BHP-Esso will be supplying the Gas &
Fuel Corporation of Victoria with
200 m. cfd.
Oil Search has had flows which com-
pare quite well with these. The Kuru
No. 1 well, which was drilled in 1956
to a depth of 968 ft. flowed at a rate
exceeding 100 m. cfd. per day and
became uncontrollable, taking five
months to seal; in 1958 the Barikewa
No. 1 had an open flow potential of
108 m. cfd, while the lehi No. 1, dril-
led two years later, produced gas with
an open flow potential of 135 m. cfd.
All these wells were relatively close to
the Papuan shoreline where Phillips-
Petroleum is currently drilling an off-
shore well. Initial testing of the gas
zone in this well flowed gas at a rate
of 22.4 m. cfd. This well was drilled
after a previous well a few miles away
had to be sealed after several uncon-
trollable gas blowouts.
Ten years ago the large gas flows
encountered by Oil Search were
certainly an embarrassment, but the
company’s potential as a gas producer
should not be too readily discounted at
the present time when Japan is buying
gas from Alaska, more than twice as
long a sea trip, at the rate of 135
m. cfd. The past ten years have also
seen the establishment of Comalco’s
bauxite mine at Weipa and the begin-
nings of other mineral projects at the
Gove Peninsula in Arnhem Land and
the McArthur River. For projects such
as these the transport of natural gas
from Papua could well prove reason-
ably attractive, as both Weipa and
Gove are not much further from the
Gulf of Papua than Adelaide is from
Gidgealpa.
Notwithstanding these possibilities
it is probably still doubtful that holders
of Oil Search are really prepared to
become long-term investors in a natural
gas industry, although many of them
have already shown a remarkable
amount of patience.


Commodities
Copper's record
COPPER PRICES escalated to the
highest price on record in London last
week a ton for wire bars) —
the previous trading high had been
chalked up at £790 a ton on April 5,
1966.
The record high level was reached
following eight consecutive days of
rising prices as depressing rumors fol-
lowed depressing statements on the
eight-month-old U.S. copper strike.
Over the previous weekend, mem-
bers of the panel which is seeking a
solution to end the stoppage, announc-
ed that the strike would continue until
the copper companies and the unions
discarded their rigid preconditions of
settlement. As a first step along this
line the panel suggested that producers
and unionists alike should modify their
stands on company-wide bargaining.
But the unions insist that any contract
agreement with a company should
apply to wages and conditions in all
the company’s units, and the companies
are being equally stubborn about stick-
ing to the present system of local wage
contracts.
The panel for their part have no
suggestions as to how the two parties
should set about resolving this differ-
ence, whereas the Administration, des-
pite a pale appeal for a “prompt set-
tlement” in the holy name of “national
interest,” are still persisting with state-
ments to the effect that the supply of
copper is at an acceptable level and
emergency measures are not yet war-
ranted.
This could well be so, despite the
loss in output of well over a million
tons caused by the strike and despite
an acute shortage of the metal on a
world-wide basis. Hopes in London
had been pinned to the panel’s dis-
covery of a way out of the U.S. strike
and were temporarily disappointed.
But as the prices on the London Metal
Exchange were escalating some late
arrivals to meet deliveries upped the
stock by 1400 tons. This had no im-
mediate effect on prices, but by the
end of last week prices of wire bars
had declined again to £740 per ton.

Hamersley $7.75, Peko $8.20, Woodside $1.52, WMC $45.50,

THE LAND
Wheat: an FAQ definition
IT IS DIFFICULT not to see more
than a little complacency in Mr. S. C.
Hodgson’s recent defence of Australia’s
“fair average quality” (FAQ) method
of wheat standardisation. Admittedly
this country has never found it par-
ticularly hard to dispose of its export-
able surplus. Yet, whatever the anti-
cipated perfections of the forthcoming
International Wheat • Agreement, com-
petition in world trade seems certain
to increase (if only because of con-
siderably greater exports from the
European Economic Community), so
it could be of great advantage to our
possible customers to know exactly
what they are getting. Australia’s
grading system is obviously not so fine
as that practised by some other major
exporters.
A few months ago the Wheat Board’s
chairman, Dr. A. R. Callaghan, hap-
pened to mention that continuance of
the FAQ classification was not neces-
sarily inevitable and that work was
being done on more exact typing.
Quality, and the meeting of desired-
end uses, could become as much a
problem for wheat in the future as it
now is for wool. A progress report
from Dr. Callaghan might therefore
be appreciated.
Mr. Hodgson, who is chairman of
the N.S.W. Grain Elevators Board, does
admit the clear advantages of fixed,
permanent statutory grading. What-
ever the grades available from season
to season, the buyer knows what he
is buying before he sees it. There are
no fluctuating levels, as in the case
with the seasonal determination of
FAQ. A measure of product differentia-
tion occurs in Australia from the fix-
ing of separate FAQs for each wheat-
growing State; indeed there are two
standards in N.S.W., the semi-hards of
South Australia, and the additional
premium wheat of Queensland. With
all these differences, Australia must sell
wheat by sample, which is not necessary
for Canada and the U.S.A. with their
predetermined standards.
The complacency enters when Mr.
Hodgson defends Australian methods
on the ground of their practicality and
their savings in administrative costs.
These benefits are, of course, apparent,
especially for storage and inspection.
Indeed, Mr. Hodgson remarks on the
“thousands of inspectors” involved in
Canada to supervise the requirements
of the Canada Grain Act. Australia, he
added, might be moving toward that
end, but there needn’t be any quick
legislation to copy Canada.
There may not much longer be suf-
ficient defence in arguing that, even
without statutory grading, not all Aus-
tralian wheat is actually sold FAQ.
“The FAQ wheat is just the general
run of the crop and, with variations, it
represents a practical system which is
in process of evolution,” Mr. Hodgson
reiterates. The process should be
speeded up.
A meticulous theoretical examination
of “Grading as a Market Innovation”
has been made by Mr. J. W. Freebairn
and published in the September, 1967,
issue of the “Review of Marketing and
Agricultural Economics.” This con-
cludes that “no buyers are made worse
off and the satisfaction of others is in-
creased. With respect to producers, a
grading innovation, whilst always in-
creasing the returns of some producers,
may also reduce the returns of some
other producers. Considered as an
aggregate, society’s utility should be
increased by a grading innovation via a
more efficient allocation of resources
which grading facilitates by increasing
the level of market knowledge.”
The harsh realities of heightened
market competition may bring that
kind of rarefied discussion very much
down to earth. The external position
at present looks tolerably easy and ex-
port opportunities plentiful. But ques-
tions must always hover over the per-
petual continuance of Communist
China’s huge demands. Just here, too,
the recent French sale of 500,000 tons
should raise plenty of doubts. France
quite plainly could not compete against
current world prices; the sale was sub-
sidised by its Common Market part-
ners at a higher than usual rate.
More significant in the long run is
the Common Market’s possible new
status in world wheat trade. The
Market’s support prices are certain to
lead to greatly increased production in
France. Lower relative supports for
West German and Italian wheat should
lessen expansion in those two countries;
most experts do not believe those lower
outputs will offset the French produc-
tion rises. Imports from non-member
countries will fall and exports to third
countries advance. The implication for
other big wheat exporters is quite clear.
Australian wheat authorities should
proceed on the assumption that world
wheat trade is not going to become
easier, or even less competitive, when
the new agreement begins to rule.
There is every case for moving toward
an exact and guaranteed certification
of quality. Its increased cost, though
an economic hindrance, may have tcv
be faced.
Agrisearch
Ruminating on rubbish and urea
PENNSYLVANIA STATE University
had us blowing a windy whistle recently
when it claimed to be keeping cattle
sleek and milking well on a diet of
newspapers and molasses. The signific-
ance of this newsword diet is its impli-
cation that animal nutritionists are on
the verge of finding practical ways of
feeding ruminants more cheaply while
providing them with fodders that do
not compete with the needs of other
animals and man. This step may not
seem very important in Australia with
its unending plains of grass, but in the
crowded world beyond our shores any-
thing that helps to alleviate the com-
petition for existing feedstuffs holds
tremendous appeal. The sad fact is that
the efficiency of feed utilisation in beef,
lamb, and milk production has barely
improved during the past 30 years,
whereas in poultry products impressive
strides have been made. The six experi-
mental heifers in Pennsylvania con-
sumed a daily ration of 2J pounds of
cut and ground paper either ordin-
ary newsprint or glossy magazines
mixed with an equal quantity of
molasses, and for dessert, as it were,
there was some soybean meal and corn
silage. (Wags might wonder whether
these cows would be able to stomach
some publications, even chopped up and
liberally sugared.)
Reports from Finland now relate that
Nobel Prize-winning chemist Arturi
Virtanen has done something much
more impressive. He has not merely
managed to replace a large part of the
normal fibre in a cow’s diet with really
rough roughage, but virtually all the
protein with the simple chemical urea.
Virtanen first won world acclaim about
two years ago when he demonstrated
that he could maintain average produc-
tion from a small dairy herd fed en-
tirely on an artificial diet. His latest
achievement uses practical materials.

For instance, a typical feed mix con-
sisted of: oats, 10.31 b.; barley, 2.91 b.;
beet pulp, 8.61 b.; hemicellulose, 6.41 b.;
straw, 21b.; sawdust, 1.11 b.; urea, lib.;
plus vitamins and minerals. The hemi-
cellulose, known as Masonex, is a by-
product of the country’s large hard-
board manufacturing industry and is
usually dumped as waste although its
energy content surpasses molasses.
On the ration, which is extremely
poor in true protein, one of Virtanen’s
heifers produced 13,0001 b. of milk
in her first lactation period and finished
the year with a body-weight equal to
that of similar heifers on a normal diet.
Another of his heifers on an even
poorer mix, because it completely
lacked grains (potatoes, beet pulp, oat
straw, wood by-products, and urea),
produced 10,7001 b. of milk and gained
bodyweight. This animal ate urea at the
remarkable rate of a day, a
quantity which provided her with 65
percent of her total nitrogen require-
ments. The milk production figures of
both cows are quite respectable con-
sidering that the heifers belong to the
small Finnish strain of Ayrshires.
While urea feeding is practically ig-
nored in Australia it has become a well-
established practice in the U.S. Most
dairy herds and feed-lot cattle are now
offered urea at the rate of 101 b. per
ton of silage or 151 b. per ton of con-
centrate. In some of the latest Ameri-
can rations the urea content has been
lifted to the point where it supplies the
animals with a quarter of their nitro-
gen. This fraction is regarded by Ameri-
cans as very daring, but it will be seen
that Virtanen’s rations contain more
than twice as much. He has avoided
poisoning his cattle by taking care to
raise the urea content of their diets
very gradually over two to three
months. During this period, the sugar
and starch portions of the diet are kept
high to stimulate fermentation and
build up a dense population of the
right kind of bacteria in the rumen.
These organisms snatch up the ammonia
released from the urea before toxic
quantities can enter the bloodstream
and convert it into amino-acids, the
building blocks of protein.
One of the exciting possibilities
arising out of Virtanen’s work is that
it could make dairying and beef pro-
duction practical in the tropical parts
of the world where land cannot be
spared for pasture and where the
human population desperately needs
all the protein it can get. Many of
these tropical areas have the where-
withal for manufacturing urea and
conditions are ideal for growing sugar-
cane, which yields more roughage and
carbohydrate per acre than almost any
other plant. Trees and scrub are also,
of course, so plentiful that they are
the bane of these areas at the moment.
But Virtanen has shown that woody
material can replace up to 30 percent
of the total feed in a ration when
enough urea is included.

Towering sermon
By PHILLIP ADAMS
The Crucible. Arthur Miller. Mel-
bourne Theatre Company, Russell
Street, Melbourne.
“ONE WALLOW doesn’t make a
summa,” someone recently observed
about that nasty, narcissistic play of
Miller’s so aptly titled “After the Fall.”
After “Salesman” and “Salem” he
really shouldn’t have embarrassed us
like that. However, having seen John
Sumner’s peremptory production of
“The Crucible,” I, for one, am willing
to forgive and forget. In this angry
play, Miller may use the theatre as his
pulpit, but he gives us a towering ser-
mon.
The play was, of course, written as
PHOTOGRAPH BY HENRY TALBOT
Monica Maughan and George Whaley in “The Crucible,”Melbourne Theatre
Company
an allegory on the crackpot despotism
of McCarthy. “The Salem tragedy,”
Miller writes, “developed from a para-
dox ... in whose grip we still live.
Simply it was this: for good purposes
the people of Salem developed a
theocracy, a combine of State and
religious power whose function was to
keep the community together and to
prevent any . . . disunity that might
open it to destruction by material and
ideological enemies. But all organisa-
tion is and must be grounded on the
idea of exclusion and prohibition.”
So, in Salem just as in Washington,
there came a time when the repressions
were disproportionate to the threat
against order, and the witch-hunt
began “a perverse manifestation of
the panic which sets in when the
balance began to turn toward greater
individual freedom.”
Now, fifteen years later, the play
shows every sign of escaping its con-
temporary environment and becoming
a classic. For when the girls of Salem
begin screaming their screams and
naming their witches, we’re seeing a
phenomenon which has occurred under
every authoritarian from Torquemada
to Stalin.
John Sumner (whom exhausted
actors describe as being something of
an authoritarian himself) believes that
a play should have speed first and
subtlety second, so he insists on a
relentless rhythm in his production.
From the beginning, when the first
crack appears in the New England
edifice, through the earthquake which
inexorably follows, until the end when
John Proctor struggles to his feet in
the rubble it’s full steam ahead and
the devil take the hindmost.
Nonetheless, cast members managed
to squeeze in some excellent if some-
what breathless performances. George
Whaley’s folksy Proctor was far more
credible than the usual heroic interpre-
tation. Monica Maughan was perfect as
his frail, pale wife, and John Gregg’s
Reverend Hale grew more impressive
as the play developed. As Deputy-
Governor Danforth, Frank Thring was
his usual commanding presence, and
Alan Hopgood impressed as the surly
Giles Corey. Richard Prins, who always
spoils us, contributed settings which
were intimidatory in their axe-hewn
hugeness and enthralling in their detail.
Loyalty rewarded
By MALDON WALKER
BRISBANE Arts Theatre patrons will
have their loyalty to little theatre re-
warded this year and the progressives’
“spend a dollar to earn two” policy
was vindicated at last week’s annual
general meeting of the theatre.
Melbourne actress, producer, and
general influence Bunney Brooke will
be joined by local playwright, producer,
and actor lan Austin in conducting
theatre workshops throughout the year.
Austin recently returned from seven
months in the United States. He is a
television producer for a Brisbane
advertising agency and was sent over-
seas by his firm.
A full-scale Broadway world premiere
is planned for his play “The Flower
Pad” later this year. The Brisbane Arts
Theatre will follow immediately with
the Australian premiere. His “Pancake
and Extras,” which he wrote in Aus-
tralia some years ago, will be produced
by a Greenwich Village little theatre
this month.
The Brooke influence on the BAT
began last year when Miss Brooke
made several dashes from Melbourne
to stand-in for local players who were
unable to make it on the day. She
liked Queensland and the BAT inti-
mate set-up and decided to stay. At
present she is producing and leading
the cast in Albee’s “A Delicate
Balance” and running workshop twice
a week. A third workshop is open for
applications. A total of five a week is
envisaged.
Later this year, Miss Brooke will
produce Arthur Miller’s “Incident at
Vichy” and Carson McCullers’ “A
Member of the Wedding.” Austin will
produce William Goodhart’s “Genera-
tion.”
BAT director Ray Dunlop said
that during 1967 the theatre showed
a record net profit of $6426. Gross
profit on productions increased from
$14,781 to $18,200. Audiences totalled
more than 40,600; door takings were a
record $32,779.


Films
Bergman's bleakest
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Winter Light. Director, Ingmar Berg-
man.
A Lesson in Love. Director, Ingmar
Bergman.
Stranger in the House. Director,
Pierre Rouve.
“WINTER LIGHT” is the third of the
Bergman “trilogy,” after “Through A
Glass Darkly” and “The Silence.” The
films are only thematically connected,
each one being a statement of Berg-
man’s profoundly pessimistic view of
human nature. This one is the bleak-
est statement yet of his discouraging
theme, but perhaps its finest distillation.
Bergman doesn’t repeat the fashion-
able catch-cries of “non-involvement”
and “lack of communication.” His
characters are dreadfully involved with
each other, and communicate only too
articulately - but only to inflict
wounds.
The central character of “Winter
Light,” the pastor of a snowbound
country district, is one whose search for
God is hopeless because he has turned
his back on man. He mourns his
idealised dead wife though an enig-
matic remark by the church organist
plants a small doubt about their de-
votion during her lifetime; he shows
a complete lack of love or sympathy
toward his devoted mistress, and com-
pares her vocally and at length with
the dead woman. When a neurotic
parishioner, obsessed with fear of the
growth of hatred in the world, comes
to him for help, the pastor’s chilly,
self-pitying homily drives the man to
suicide.
The film, whose action takes place
during one beautifully photographed
wintry Sunday, ends with the pastor
starting his evening service in a church
empty except for his mistress —“Where
else have I to go?” she asks miserably
and the verger and organist who
would rather be elsewhere. “It may be
that this service will give him back
his lost faith,” says the Press-sheet
synopsis hopefully. Not a chance, I’m
afraid.
If you’ve never seen a Bergman film,
this would be a daunting one to start
with. Fortunately, the supporting
feature is in much lighter vein. “A
Lesson in Love” is an earlier Bergman
film, not seen here before, a frivolous
tale of the reconciliation of a straying
husband and wife. As always happens
in his movies, the casting and acting
are brilliant, with Gunnar Bjornstrand,
who gives a splendid performance as
the ice-bound pastor in the other film,
proving that he’s got a considerable
flair for light comedy, too.
James Mason surprisingly manages a
pretty good performance in “Stranger
in the House,” a dreadfully botched
movie based more or less on a good
Simenon novel which once made a
sound, straightforward French film.
The transplantation of the story from a
French provincial town to England
makes nonsense of the whole thing
from the start. As well, the director
(French-born, though he’s been work-
ing as a producer and scriptwriter in
England) can’t make up his mind what
sort of picture he’s making—a thriller?
A sociological treatise? Or a desper-
ately mod film full of symbolism and
cinema-verite?
Avant Guardsvan
By PHILLIP ADAMS
English Underground Films. Dendy
Theatre, Melbourne.
FAR AND AWAY the best film in this
latest ÜBU collection was David Glad-
well’s “Untitled Film,” depicting a
child’s first confrontation with death.
While a farmer wrings the neck of a
chicken in eerie, hypnotic slow-motion,
Gladwell intercuts with rhythmic
images of harvesting, the liquid move-
ment of a leaping cat, and the child’s
slowly expanding expression of horror.
By stretching every fragment of time
until it hovers in the air, the feeling
of psychological shock is achieved and
intensified with images of great beauty
and purity. The photography was by
Joseph Losey’s son Gavin.
Bruce Beresford’s “King Size
Woman” is a colorful account of
Nigeria’s brilliantly painted buses with
their biblical names like “The Lord
is My Shepherd” and “Lead Kindly
Light.” It was skilfully edited to the
beat of a Nigerian rock-’n-roll group,
whose sound had its own fascination.
“Dream A 40” is a sub-Kafka fan-
tasy concerning the sexual guilts of two
homosexuals. It was pedestrian in con-
cept and uneasy in execution, although
a heavy petting session managed to
arouse the audience’s interest and/or
anxiety. Emigre Australian Don Leavy
contributed “Point of Noon,” a two-
minute visualisation of Christopher
Brennan’s poem, which, while an
accomplished piece of work, had a sus-
piciously fashionable look about it
like an avant garde TV commercial.
“The Adventures of X” was filmed
in London by an all-Australian team
with a music track by Seb Jorgenson
(a former music and drama critic of
The Bulletin).
Put together with rough-as-guts Oz
enthusiasm, it concerns a skinny weak-
ling who writes off for a host of direct-
mail self-improvement courses. After a
series of indecently funny episodes, he
emerges as a monster worthy of Dr.
Frankenstein.
A likable indigenous offering was
“Sunday in Sydney” by the ABC’s
talented Michael Pearce. This was a
disorganised but lively account of a
city’s sabbath, in which the hell-fire
street sermons of corner and radio
evanelists were juxtaposed with more
secular activities.
Opera
Amateur effort
By JOHN CARGHER
Der Freischutz. Weber. Victorian Opera
Company. Union, Melbourne.
THE ELIZABETHAN Theatre Trust is
presenting five operas this year. The
Victorian Opera Company is producing
five operas this year. There the re-
semblance ends. The Trust spends an
astronomical multiple of the dollars and
cents laid out by the VOC for its five
productions; it is no reflection on the
Trust that its offerings are very far
from astronomically ' better than what
the VOC offers to its as yet limited
audiences.
The first-ever local opera subscription
series consists of five works, Weber’s
“Der Freischutz,” followed by Mozart’s
“Seraglio,” Britten’s “Albert Herring,”
Rossini’s “Cinderella,” and Verdi’s
“Nabucco,” all to be produced during
the coming months in the newly, and
elegantly, rebuilt Union Theatre. The
opening production of “Der Freischutz”
was an excellent example of the com-
pany’s virtues and failings. Among the
former, the choice of works which are
tuneful, enjoyable, yet unlikely to be
performed in this country, highlights the
fine musical direction the company en-
joys at the hands of Leonard Spira.
“Der Freischutz” was an important
milestone in operatic history which
pointed the way to Wagner in an era
when Mozart and Rossini were king.
The musical aspects, of the performance
were good enough to allow an accurate
picture of Weber’s intentions to be
heard and seen. However, the dramatic
potential of both stage picture and the
work of the artists was not realised to
the full, i
The standard of the soloists,, with one
exception, was very much better than
could reasonably be expected, and the
orchestra remains the main strength of
the company. If Spira’s conducting-
appeared a little slack compared with
past achievements, minor Spira is still
very much major in terms of orchestral
direction even in some professional
companies. The ladies dominated the
evening. Margaret Field is an admir-
able, if too exuberant, comedienne with
an excellent voice. Her Aennchen was
the outstanding character and her duets
with Anna Nagel’s Agathe were a de-
light. Miss Nagel is a fine leading sop-
rano, though she does not yet pass as a
professional. Trevor Reed has an excel-
lent stage presence, a fine manner, and
a good voice which is limited only in
the lower reaches. His Caspar was im-
posing in all but the vital Wolf’s Glen
scene, in which the producer failed to
exploit his potential.


Music
Print and practice
By PAUL FROLICH
THE FINAL two Sydney “Prom”
concerts seemed to prove my suspicion
that, no matter how interesting a pro-
gram may look in print, in actual lis-
tening it is rare for more than one
item to leave a lasting impact. For the
fourth concert, the list of composers
ran: Britten, Stravinsky, Dreyfus, Grieg,
Lilburn, and Dvorak.
Britten was represented by the Over-
ture “The Building of the House,”
opus 79, wriLten last year. Though com-
petent, this is not very substantial music
neither to offend nor to rouse great
enthusiasm. George Dreyfus and New
Zealander Douglas Lilburn were equally
inoffensive. Dreyfus’ “Music for Music
Camp” has some recognisable merit
as a piece for a hastily assembled
group- of competent students; it was
not enough of a challenge for a pro-
fessional symphony orchestra and
proved lightweight in wit, usually Drey-
fus’ strong suit.
Stravinsky’s “Momentum pro Gesu-
aldo di Venosa” was a much richer
experience. The 16th century was
more strongly in evidence than Stra-
vinsky’s own contribution, which was
all to the good. The work uses the
material of three Gesualdo madrigals,
and I will concede that the colorful
instrumentation used may enable in-
experienced listeners to approach a
deeper appreciation of early music.
The great surprise of the evening,
for me at any rate, was Dvorak’s “Te
Deum.” John Hopkins is not only to
be thanked for playing this work; he
conducted the large orchestral forces
and combined choirs with aplomb and
success. The choirs might have bene-
fited from longer rehearsals, baritone
John Brosnan from a more flexible
style. Against that, Judith Ashby proved
a splendidly controlled young soprano,
with a voice big enough for operatically
dramatic sections and full of fine fervor.
The final concert of the series was
distinguished by the inclusion of two
of the most iconoclastic composers of
recent times: Ives and Grainger.
After Rossini’s “Thieving Magpie”
Overture and Elgar’s “Sea Pictures”
the evening’s first meat was provided
by Charles Ives with his short “Un-
answered Question,” one of the most
daunting pieces of orchestral mystifica-
tion. Written in 1908, it is daringly
modern in concept, played by strings
and a wholly separate ensemble of wind
players. But for the intrusion of jet
engines and ambulance sirens from out-
side, the quietly beautiful string music
would have been more haunting, broken
into as it is periodically by the trumpet
and its woodwind followers.
“The Warriors” was written by Percy
Grainger between 1913 and 1917 and
is probably his grandest orchestral work.
Conceived for a non-existing ballet, it
uses enormous instrumental resources,
including three pianos and a wide range
of tuned percussion instruments. In
places it requires three conductors and
employs such modernisms as striking
piano strings in pairs with drumsticks.
It is music of enormous energy and
demonstrates Grainger’s inventive
ability, which is still widely unrecog-
nised.
Art
Words, words...

Group 1, Gallery A, Sydney.
Group Exhibition, Central Street Gal-
lery, Sydney.
Andrew Sibley, Komon Gallery, Syd-
ney.
THE DOCTRINAL and terminologi-
cal dispute now slightly disturbing the
art world recalls such issues as whether
the Heidelberg painters were really im-
pressionistic and whether the image is
central to art, but the current discussion
has theological or, if you wish, Big and
Little Ender overtones. It’s all about
terms to describe the uniformly sur-
faced, flat, clean-edged paintings like
those at Central Street or those of Dale
Hickie, Partos, Aspden, Jacks, Leach-
Jones, or Syd Ball.
Tony McGillick, who manages the
Central Street, objects to “hard-edge,”
which he says is no longer used in
U.S.A., the land of its origin, and
prefers Clement Greenberg’s “post-
painterly abstraction.” Of course, both
these terms are not much used today
because their first use simply indicated
the rise of a new movement and became
less useful as individuality, well in
evidence at Central Street and A, began
to emerge. Terms like Cubism and
Impressionism do describe, but time-
slot definitions like post-painterly
abstraction and post-impressionism are
simply too vague.
Maybe the coiner of terms, Green-
berg, who will be in Australia in mid-
May and later in New Zealand, will
elaborate on these issues: meanwhile,
Dr. Donald Brook has proposed
“Adventitious Abstraction,” as he
thinks the new abstraction is not, con-
trary to Patrick McCoughey’s view, a
thing-in-itself, but gathers nourishment
from all over. He could have called it
Contextual Abstraction, which might
have made the problem about his
terms clearer: must we see the work in
a context to grasp it or does its con-
textual origin explain it?
You see what’s happening; I’m dis-
cussing the terms and not looking at
paintings, and when one does look
through a haze of terms we are involved
in an Event similar to that of the
peasant girl’s vision of the Holy Mary;
it has to be tested for theological
validity. Does her vision (read paint-
ing) involve the correct concept? East
November, Claes Oldenburg buried
this issue when, as a contribution to
the Sculpture in Environment show, he
had two gravediggers sink a hole to
inter unseen sculpture in New York’s
Central Park. There was no sculpture,
of course, and the point is that if art
is not a visual matter but a concept,
let’s not be worried about unique
visions, paintings, and sculptures. Odd,
isn’t it, that after fifty years of being
told to shake off visual habits we have
put on the conceptual blinkers.
In 1913 (and this is relevant because
Duchamp’s archives, now at Melbourne,
will be seen soon elsewhere )
Duchamp’s Nude Descending a Stair-
case was described derisively, yet with
some sign of perspicacity, as an explo-
sion in a shingles factory, a collection
of saddlebags, or a Staircase Descend-
ing a Nude. The deriders had at least
looked. The new non-criticism, which
includes attacks on Hard Edge as
anonymous and international plagiar-
ism, simply vilifies, and it’s time to
reconsider criticism as the examination
of how formal values relate to feelings,
passion, emotions, and aesthetic mean-
ing.
The doctrinal debate has other irri-
tating side-effects, for it has given this
Central Street show an unwarranted im-
portance: there’s a moral here about
pioneers and consolidators, for the
Gallery A show is superior to that at
the trail-blazing Central, where only
Tony McGillick, with tough, impacted
diamond shapes softened by gently
fluctuating color, and Schlicht, pursu-
ing his quiet, tonal repetition of forms,
show distinct improvement. Watkins,
somewhat fallen from pure Grace, has
a swirl of sharp-edged shapes, partly
surreal and cereal-package inspired, and
quite unlike his previous shallow sur-
faces. Despite detractors, there is
variety here: Noritis is a relational
painter, depending on the tug and
trajectory of forms; Dillon deals in
harsh optical effects; Johnson shows
how encompassing blue can turn matt
black into a void; and White how forms
can both spill from and rush back to a
painting with some impetus.
At Gallery A the variety is further
extended: Partos has two large arrow-
heads in flight, leaving a wall empty
behind but retaining some of his former
Picassoid fervor; Aspen’s bounded areas
are like doors to nirvana, Sellbach is
intrigued by the colorful life at the edge
of his large scalloped form, Treweeke
is developing a sinister, carnivorous
flower garden through Art Nouveau, and
Clarke, in some beautifully reposeful
work, discloses the powerful classicism
that informs much Hard Edge and tex-
ture painting.
Here I can’t do justice to all these
painters who have revolutionised the

Two Naive Painters
Naive painter James Fardoulys at work in his studio
Mr. James Fardoulys, whose work is shown on this page,
and Mr. Charles Callins, whose paintings are on the next
page, are two painters working in Queensland. “Naive” is
now generally accepted as a more accurate description than
“primitive” for this style of work, but it is clear that Mr.
Fardoulys and Mr. Callins are naive in only one sense.

scene with an unprecedented display of
talent, nor can I remove some of the
injustices recently heaped upon that
modest artist Andrew Sibley, who has
attained a new, lyrical ease; there is
less psychological and more whimsical
and visual distortion as he seeks the
out-of-focus, slipping glance at the
world. This smudgy melting is usually
balanced by clear-cut forms as in The
Dressing Table or sharp drawing in an
excellent Siill Life in Grey. There is
rather an imbalance in Sibley’s atti-
tudes: he likes the sour opulence of
Van Dongen, but Baconian dogs and
sofas prowl through his paintings and
he may find a rewarding corrective in
Klee, who has begun to interest him
more. Sibley has an expressive finesse
that might appear uncommitted when
compared wi h the apparent honest
clumsiness of Ken Whisson, who has a
characteristic painting at Stern’s $l9O

display a turmoil of the emotions or
declare your allegiance to what is,
theoretically, flat-earthism in painting
to be a painter. Sibley is a decorative
and wandering maverick but a painter
nonetheless.
Boyd's Bible
BY BARRY HUMPHRIES
ARTHUR BOYD is now firmly estab-
lished, along with Russell Drysdale and
Sidney Nolan, as an internationally
famous Australian artist. Since his work
was chosen to represent Australia at the
Venice Biennale in 1958 he has lived
and worked in London, apart from
periods of extensive travel on the Con-
tinent, and in this time his painting
has shown an astonishing growth in
richness and eloquence.
In Europe he has been honored in
many ways; London’s Whitechapel Gal-
lery gave him a large retrospective
exhibition a few years ago, and he has
been constantly busy, between the exe-
cution of public and private commis-
sions, in designing ceramic murals,
tapestry, book illustrations, decor, and
costume for Covent Garden, as well as
exhibiting regularly in Europe and Aus-
tralia.
Soon, at the Adelaide Festival, Aus-
tralians will have an opportunity to see
a suite of recent paintings which I be-
lieve to be the finest and most astonish-
ing things he has done. The theme of
these large panels is biblical, for bibli-
cal and mythological themes have
always obsessed him, even intruding,
from time to time, upon the most tran-
quil of his Australian landscapes. The
presence of a black crow or horned ram
beside some limpid dam or secret gully
must be read as an omen, for Arthur
Boyd has always discerned and ex-
pressed what is inimical and super-
stitious in the Australian landscape.
The new pictures are inspired by the
Book of Daniel and King Nebuchad-
nezzar, who “dreamed dreams, and his
spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake
from him.”
The madness and delirium of a fugi-
tive king is the theme of each of these
remarkable canvases. “Thou shalt be
driven from men, dwelling with the
beasts of the field, and thou shalt be
made to eat grass as oxen . . Draw-
ing on this theme of exile and degrada-
tion, Arthur Boyd has created a kind
of Old Testament Stations of the Cross
through which the figure of Nebuchad-
nezzar stumbles until madness itself is
seen to have some huge cathartic
nobility. Frequently we see the King
in flames fallen like Icarus or like
some anguished meteor last year
Boyd saw a Vietnam protestor immo-
late himself by fire on Hampstead
Heath. Sometimes he stalks blind be-
neath stars sprouting blue flowers an
echo of the demonic cripples in the
artist’s Port Melbourne paintings of
1942. At other times, Nebuchadnezzar
swims chin up like a lost white dog
through a waterhole in a wilderness,
and one is reminded of the strange
sentinel dog in the Piero di Cosimo
picture in the National Gallery, Lon-
don, which Arthur Boyd has quoted
and interpreted in so many of his paint-
ings in recent years.
Indeed, the images in this remark-
able series are extrapolated from a
whole repertoire of imagery which
Boyd has assembled and refined over
nearly thirty years. The cripple, the
ram, the hunter, the swooping crow,
the writhing and observed lovers, the
brides, windmills, waterfalls, and
wheatfields, and, through all, that suf-
fering metamorphosed being of Arthur
Boyd’s imagination, “his body wet with
the dew of Heaven, till his hair was
grown like eagles’ feathers, and his
nails like the claws of birds.”
The elements of the marvellous and
the fantastic are perhaps stronger in
these paintings than in any other works
by this artist. Yet I believe they are
most powerful and coherent. The
splendors and miseries of King
Nebuchadnezzar’s passion are enacted
within a sublime Australian landscape
painted with a freedom and bravura
which Arthur Boyd has not, I think,
previously equalled.
As a colorist, Arthur Boyd emerges
triumphantly in this series. He has
painted skies and fire and gold and
falling water before, and he has painted
man in the midst of it all, but never
with such incandescence or such brio.
All those many gifts seem to have
coalesced here; so that each picture is
a single and astounding gesture and
not merely a series of little victories
over pigment and figment.
Yet it is not the presence of a great
technique which finally wins and moves
us, but the intimate presence of a very
great artist.


BOOKS
A man whose thoughts are far
more memorable than Mao’s
The New Industrial State. J. K. Gal-
braith. Hamish Hamilton. $5.30.
THE VAGUE FEELING that there
is something rather naughty about
being fat and well-off in a world where
so many people are starving has for
years stimulated the American middle-
class into massive bursts of “do-
goodery,” as Rotary, Lions Clubs, and
so on around the country have
struggled to show which has the
greater social conscience.
Now this uneasiness has been given
a new dimension; now the industrial
system that produces this affluence is
itself being shown as a danger to free-
dom, a threat to the proper objectives
of a liberal, democratic society. Now,
in his most important book yet, John
Kenneth Galbraith, the archetype
American liberal with an almost Calvin-
ist concern about the evils of affluence,
has provided uneasy Americans with a
real and admirably presented intellec-
tual position against the accepted truths
of the industrial society, exploding its
myths, slaying its dragons, and point-
ing the way to salvation.
It is all so well written; its read-
ability in a field renowned for the dull-
ness of its practitioners adds a dis-
turbing persuasiveness to Galbraith’s
line of argument. He should be read
with all defences up. For, despite the
remarkable good sense of so much of
what he has to say, there is an awful
lot of overstatement, of bad economics,
and poorly argued assertions. But his
latest book is hugely important. It is
far more than simply a sequel to “The
Affluent Society,” whose relationship
to “The New Industrial State” is one
of entree to main course. With its
massive popular appeal, it will certainly
confirm Galbraith as the best-selling
economist in history. He has yet to
prove the most influential.
His thesis is, simply, that “We are
becoming the servants, in thought as in
action, of the machine we have created
to serve us.” The system that has
brought prosperity, mass production,
and professional management is getting
out of hand. Already, two-thirds of
American business activity is in the
hands of only 500 or so giant cor-
porations; the task Galbraith sets is
not to resist the growth of large cor-
porations but to resist accepting the
goals of this sort of industrial system
as goals for society as a whole, of pre-
venting our lives being submerged to
its demands.
It is the genius of the industrial
system that it makes the goals that
reflect its needs efficient production
of goods, a steady expansion in their
consumption, a powerful preference for
goods over leisure, an unqualified com-
mitment to technological change,
autonomy for the technostructure, an
adequate supply of trained and educa-
ted manpower co-ordinate with
social virtue and human enlighten-
ment!
If we fail to resist, “Our wants will
be managed in accordance with the
needs of the industrial system; the
policies of the State will be subject to
similar influence; education will be
adapted to industrial need; the disci-
plines required by the industrial system
will be the conventional morality of
the community. All other goals will
By MICHAEL BAUME
be made to seem precious, unimport-
ant, or anti-social ... It will not be
freedom.”
His analysis of the nature of the
modern industrial state is not drama-
tically new; as a brilliant synthesiser,
he is far more indebted to other
thinkers around the subject than his
acknowledgements would suggest. But
the very act of collecting their views
into one beautifully presented parcel
gives them a new, more significant
impact. He recognises .this lack of
originality in the various lines of attack
he develops on the American business
myths: “The control by the mature
corporation over its prices, its influence
on consumer behaviour, the euthanasia
of stockholder power, the regulation by
the State of aggregate demand, the
effort to stabilise prices and wages, the
role of publicly supported research and
development, the role of military, space,
and related development, the influence
of the firm on these Government acti-
vities and the modern role of education
are, more or less, accepted facts of life.
What is avoided is reflection on the
consequences of putting them all
together, of seeing them as a system.”
His basic point is that real power in
the new industrial state, which passed
from the entrepreneurs who built up
their corporations to the managers who
Galbraith ... conservatives wrong
ran them in the “managerial revolu-
tion,” has now moved on again to what
Galbraith calls the “technostructure,”
the large collection of people inside a
corporation who contribute to group
decision-making. “Nearly all powers—
initiation, character of development,
rejection, or acceptance are exer-
cised deep in the company. It is not
the managers who decide. Effective
power of decision is lodged deeply in
the technical, planning, and other
specialised staff.”
The technostructure has become
autonomous; it has removed itself
from control by the stockholders, has-
acquired its own internal sources of
capital, so that it no longer is subject
to the directions of financiers, and has
reduced the relevance of trades unions.
The result of this is that the corpora-
tion fulfils a different kind of role
and has a different set of objectives
from those in the old-style capitalism.
It aims now at maximising growth in
sales rather than profits; at organising
markets to suit its ends rather than
responding to the demands of the con-
sumer; of having an influence on gov-
ernment through the civil service rather
than political parties.
But, most important of all, the cor-
porations are coming closer to the
State. “The industrial system will not
long be regarded as something apart
from government,” says Galbraith. “In
time the line between the two will
disappear. Conservatives have looked
in the wrong direction for the danger.
They have feared that the State might
reach out and destroy the vigorous,
money-making entrepreneur. They have
not noticed that, all the while, the
successors to the entrepreneurs were
uniting themselves ever more closely
with the State and rejoicing in the


result. They were also, and with
enthusiasm, accepting abridgement of
their freedom,” says Galbraith, who
did not even give a pafcsing acknow-
ledgement to Schumpeter, who wrote
all this, but not nearly so nicely, many
years ago.
He extends the Schumpeter thesis
by arguing that there is no real free-
dom in the market-place in the new
industrial society; that demand can be
so manipulated by the devices of
persuasion (particularly television)
that it is unreal to see corporations as
serving the wishes of consumers. “Large-
scale industrialism requires that the
market and consumer sovereignty be
extensively superseded. The initiative
in deciding what is to be produced
comes not from the sovereign consumer
. . . but from the great producing
organisation which reaches forward to
control the markets that it is pre-
sumed to serve and, beyond, to bend
the customer to its needs. And in
so doing it deeply influences his values
and beliefs . . . The imperatives of
technology and organisation, not the
images of ideology, are what determine
the shape of economic society. (Gal-
braith ignores the reality that the pro-
ducts of the new industrial state have
brought a better life; that the motor
car, television set, drip-dry shirt, wash-
ing machine, “miracle” drugs, and so
on are bought not simply because an
ad-man has created a market by mak-
ing people think they want them but
because they serve a useful purpose;
they are desirable.) He is clearly right
about the impact of the State on the
market: “The industrial system requires
a large public sector for the stabilisation
of aggregate demand. And the system’s
planning reaches its highest state of
development in modern military pro-
curement.” So Galbraith sees no rea-
son for an ideological conflict with the
Russians. “Convergence between the
two ostensibly different industrial
systems occurs at all fundamental
points. In time, and perhaps less time
than may be imagined, it will dispose
of the notion of inevitable conflict
based on irreconcilable difference.”
The conflict he welcomes is that
aimed at separating the industrial sys-
tem’s goals from those of society; of
seeing it in the “fitting light as an
essentially technical arrangement for
providing convenient goods and ser-
vices in adequate volume ... a detached
and autonomous arm of the State, but
responsive to the larger purposes of the
society.”
“If the industrial system is only a
part, and a relatively diminishing part,
of life, there is much less occasion for
concern. Aesthetic goals will have pride
of place; those who serve them will not
be subject to the goals of the industrial
system; the industrial system will be
subordinate to the claims of these
dimensions of life. Intellectual prepara-
tion will be for its own sake and not for
the better service to the industrial sys-
tem. Men will not be entrapped by the
belief that apart from the goals of the
industrial system —apart from the pro-
duction of goods and income by pro-
gressively more advanced technical
methods —there is nothing more in life.”
But Galbraith does not tell us how
it is possible to get the best of both
these worlds; his whole argument sug-
gests it is impossible to do so —that
the pursuit of industrial pleasure pro-
duces the pain of servitude to the mon-
ster that provides it. He shows us where
to go, but not how to get there.
Galbraith, nevertheless, does provide
a magnificent collection of apposite
phrases; his “thoughts” are far more
memorable than Mao’s; someone (and
it will probably be Galbraith) should
collect them. Here are a few to start:
“What counts is not the quantity of
our goods but the quality of our life.”
“The danger to liberty lies in the
subordination of belief to the needs of
the industrial system.” “Economics as it
is conventionally taught is in part a
system of belief designed less to reveal
truth than to reassure its communi-
cants about established social arrange-
ments.” “The annual meeting of the
large American corporation is perhaps
our most elaborate exercise in popular
illusion.” “The enemy of the market
is not ideology but the engineer.”
“Aesthetic achievement is beyond the
reach of the industrial system and in
substantial measure in conflict with
it.” “The autonomy of the technostruc-
ture is a functional necessity of the in-
dustrial system.” “The industrial sys-
tem requires a mechanism for making
men want what it provides.”
The effects of
protest
By T. K. TOBIN
The Intellectuals and McCarthy: the
Radical' Specter. Michael Paul
Rogin. Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Press. $l2.
DURING THE ANTI-WAR demon-
strations in America last October, the
protest movement held up two masks
for the mass media. Dr. Spock’s face
was impressed on one of them: during
a march he tried without success to
climb under and then over a police
barrier; in desperation he finally told
the policemen in charge that he was
rather anxious to commit civil dis-
obedience and, with all the tact of
school ma’ams well-versed in the
doctor’s toilet-training theories, they let
him. The reporters solemnly licked
their pencils and noted “The arrest
this morning of famed child-
specialist . . .” Thus the right of every
man not only to step out, but to be
seen to step out was publicly re-
affirmed.
The other mask was eyed by Robert
McNamara from his window as the
protesters gathered to paralyse the
Defence Department; it was as intricate
as the New Left is ecumenical about
radical issues, and as bizarre as the
political promiscuity of Californian
hippies singing “We Shall Overcome”
on (of all places) the Pentagon lawn.
It was also as violent as the assault de-
tachments storming the steps to offer
bloodied heads to police truncheons
and the ever-discriminating television
lens.
Michael Rogin’s book is relevant to
those events because he raises the ques-
tions of the role of protest in a mass-
democracy, and whether a social theory
that stresses institutional stability is not
in fact a conservative and therefore
anti-radical one.
He successfully cuts McCarthyism
down to size by pointing out the role
of various elites in trying to exploit it:
the Republican Party, for so long out
of national office, was prepared to
tolerate Senator McCarthy to gain
more purchase with the electorate; his
Senate colleagues were loath to risk
the traditions of seniority, etc., by de-
priving him of his committee power;
the Press gave him notoriety because
exposes and threats sold papers. It
was only when he moved against the
Army, thereby threatening, the network
of conservative elites —in other words
“when he became radical”—that they
deserted him and hastened his down-
fall. Even when the polls showed a
majority of Americans “supported”
McCarthy he did not entice them away
from their normal voting habits, and
so could not appeal to the people (over
the heads of the political leadership)
to save him.
The irony of Rogin’s thesis would be
that McCarthy was not only responsible
for the unmaking of radical intellec-
tuals, but that he scared them into a
defence of stability, that he converted
them into conservatives. Rogin argues
that the social theory of pluralism, as
presented initially in “The New Ameri-
can Right,” edited by Daniel Bell, was
the panic-reaction of once-radical intel-
lectuals to the spectre of McCarthyism,
which hastened them to the end of their
Joseph McCarthy . . . committee power


journey away from the Left to an
acceptance of modem America, and
its conserving ethic of industrialism.
They launched a theory aimed at the
. . •,.* c • , 1 . i. ,
stability of the social system which was
i ~ c ,i ■
as much a therapy for their own
trauma as an analysis of the nation’s
political history. As a result of their
fear of mass movements that spurn
the institutional channels of protest and
seek to invalidate the social consensus,
he says that the pluralists attributed to
“peripheral radical movements the
diseases they had previously located at
the heart of the American ethos.” Intel-
lectuals such as Bell, Lipset, Hofstadter,
etc., took fright at a non-existent mass
movement and dropped their radical
bundles in the process.
„ . . , . „ • i
On an academic level, Rogin does
set up a case to be answered about the
popu ist natuie and thieat of Me-
Carthyism; he does not succeed in dis-
counting the ideological and mational
dynamic of earlier agrarian populism,
which of itself is a consistent under-
pinning of pluralist theory. On an
operational level, his book is an attack
on the “end of ideology” school as a
liberal training centre in a conservative
commitment to political stability. It
reads like an attempt to rescue the
protest movement from the charge that
“they seek influence through direct
action—riots, strikes, marches; sus-
picious of parliaments, mass move-
ments prefer the streets” ... or the
Pentagon lawns. As such, Rogin has
done implicitly what he accuses the
“ex-radical” pluralists of doing—
importing social values and prescrip-
tions into a descriptive social theory—
as if masks did not invite judgments.
Rogin sees the theory of pluralism
rather as an anti-missile missile, aimed
at destroying the ideological warhead of
a reform tradition suspicious of exist-
ing political structures as effective or
valid means for the transformation of
American society. His argument, there-
fore, attempts to jam their radar the
pluralists who launched their theory to
intercept McCarthyism failed to see
that it had no warhead to begin with,
that it was not a mass movement of
the radical Right at all, but rather a
traditional conservative movement that
was both central to and episodic in
American political history. He rejects
the view that it grew out of an earlier
Left-wing agrarianism revealing its
genetic characteristics by a populist out-
burst of frustration and resentments,
claiming as its scapegoats the Eastern
Establishment, the industrial aristo-
cracy—and liberal intellectuals.
A never-ending dialogue
By G. P. MOLNAR
The Practice of History. G. R. Elton.
Sydney University Press. $3.00.
THERE ARE TWO ways of reading
this essay by a distinguished Cambridge
historian. One is in the terms recom-
mended by the publishers: as a contri-
bution “to the present debate about
the question ‘What is history?’ ” The
other is to read it as reflections of a
professional on some aspects of his
craft. One’s estimate of the book will
vary greatly, depending on which of
these two approaches one adopts.
Taken at its most serious, as an
argument about the nature of history,
Dr. Elton’s essay is very tedious. It
contains plenty of polemics on behalf
of the autonomy of history against tho'se
who would subordinate it to the social
sciences, or to the requirements of
prophesying or of moralising. Here, the
main enemies are “sociologism” and
Marxism. Other targets are various
forms of scepticism about the possibility
of historical knowledge, and relativistic
reservations about its worth. The
objects of criticism are not always
clearly identified, nor are they ever
presented at their strongest. The case
Dr. Elton brings against them is not
sufficiently tightly argued to convince
anybody but the converted.
The same can be said of the position
from and for which the author argues.
His view of history is that it is the
study of dead humanity for its own
sake, in which a professionally acquired
and fostered scientific attitude is
brought to bear on the material
remnants of the past. On the research
side history is a dialogue between the
historian and the evidence. In its
written presentation it is an art, the
art of constructing vivid and intelligible
narratives and analyses in jargonless
ordinary language.
All of this is painfully unoriginal.
Some of these theses had been first
supported in the 18th century, and
there is scarcely a point of substance
in the book which has not been widely
anticipated, mostly by despised non-
historians. Those ignorant of philo-
sophers of history are condemned to
repeat them. Nor has Dr. Elton found
any novel, fresh, and conclusive reasons
in justification of this time-honored
view of history. It is hard to see how
anybody who (unlike the reviewer) is
not already strongly attracted to Dr.
Elton’s conclusions could come to
rationally accept them on reading
“The Practice of History.”
It is not at all difficult, however, to
approach this work from an entirely
different point of view. Then it sud-
denly comes to life. The study of
history is a practice, not only in the
sense in which all scientific - activity is
practical, but more narrowly so, since
history, like philosophy, and quite un-
like the natural sciences, cannot boast
that the bulk of its findings are con-
gealed in a body of authoritative,
settled conclusions. Historical findings
are fluid and highly revisable; the study
of history is a never-ending dialogue.
To talk intelligently about a practice
in this sense, be it carpentry, journal-
ism, child-rearing, or history-writing,
requires different capacities from those
used in abstract theorising, and such
talk is to be measured by different
standards. A craftsman, listened to
without rationalistic impatience, will
tell one a lot that is interesting, and a
little that is profound, about his work.
He will never tell all, for what he
knows cannot be fully unpacked in the
telling. Its essence lies in the doing.
Many of Dr. El' on’s remarks make
good sense if viewed as practical
reflections rather than as attempted
philosophical analyses. His objection
to the “New Ways in History”"
school, that the application of sophisti-
cated statistical techniques to distant
history fails for want of suitable data,
is surely sound as far as it goes. In
supporting his claim that politics is of
central importance both in the teaching
and the writing of history, he shrewdly
points out that past politics is better
documented than most other areas of
historical concern. The conservatism
of Elton’s vision of history can be seen
as the conservatism of the practitioner.
Those involved in doing, having prac-
tical experience of the ins and outs of
an ongoing activity, are always con-
scious of limitations, of pitfalls, and of
the baselessness of the the optimism
of reformers. It is from such insiders*
views that any conservatism gains its
plausibility and strength. This orienta-
tion stands Dr. Elton in good stead.
At the same time “The Practice of
History” is heir to some of the con-
genital weaknesses of conservatism.
That a historian of the 1960 s cannot do
much with the statistical information
surviving from the 16th century is true.
Yet it does not show that the historian
of the 22nd century will not be able to
make startlingly effective use of the
statistics of the 20th century surviving
to him. Again, ever since the Depres-
sion, the amount of documentation of
all kinds on the economic life of indus-
trialised countries has increased greatlv.
Economic facts are becoming as avail-
able to historians as political ones. The
general moral is that history as an
academic subject is itself capable of
historical change and that our
appraisals of what history is must not
entirely overlook what history can
become. It is not enough to regard
what presently exists as the outcome of
cumulative past changes, the culmina-
tion of a scientific tradition. The
present is also the forerunner of the
future. For all we know a new-fashioned
history is already maturing within the
womb of the old. Then would we not
look foolish for having declared such
a conception impossible?

How an ounce of
Clarified Butter
brings out
a ton of flavour.
Clarified Butter (pure dairy butter with
the water, salt and curd removed)
brings out natural flavours in cooking
in a way no other cooking fats or oils
can. Because you use less Clarified
Butter than other fats (just enough to
cover the pan) food comes to the table
less greasy. The rea/flavour gets
through. And because you cook in
Clarified Butter at lower temperatures
than normal, foods don’ttoughen up.
Try this Chicken Cacciatore and see if
' what I say isn’t dead right.
‘ CHICKEN CACCIATORE ?
1,3-3% lb. chicken
1 oz. Clarified Butter
2 med. onions, chopped
% lb. mushrooms, sliced
4 tomatoes, skinned and chopped
1 oz. tomato paste
salt and pepper
pinch paprika
1 cup chicken stock (chicken broth
cube and water)
2 tabs, dry red wine (claret
or burgundy)
Cut chicken into serving pieces and fry
in heated Clarified Butter until golden
brown. Set aside. Fry onions and
mushrooms adding extra Clarified
Butter if necessary. Add chicken
pieces, tomatoes, tomato paste, salt,
pepper, paprika, stock and wine. Cover
and simmer gently approx. 1 hour.
Serve with buttered noodles sprinkled
with grated Australian Parmesan

NATURE'S FINEST
Self-sacrifices
By SANDRA HALL
The Cats of Benares. Geraldine Halls.
Heinemann. $2.65.
Don’t Look at Me Like That. Diana
Athill. Chatto and Windus. $3.15.
INDIA’S POWER TO bewitch and
bewilder, to send Anglo-Saxon logic
and values somersaulting has compelled
many novelists to write about it. And
Geraldine Halls does so with a sure
sense of all its contradictions. An Aus-
tralian who spent two years living and
working in Delhi, she conveys vividly
India’s atmosphere of debilitation and
the hierarchy of helplessness on which
it stands so precariously.
Yet although “The Cats of Benares”
is a novel of a particular place and
time, it is by no means a “social” novel,
since the troubles afflicting India are
woven quite deftly into the story of a
love affair between Richard Mardellis,
an Englishman working on rural educa-
tion projects for UNESCO, and the
Australian wife of one of his colleagues.
Richard is married to Pamela, a woman
whose self-absorbtion verges on neuro-
ticism and whose hatred of India dates
from the incident which gives the book
its title.
Pamela and Richard are staying in
a Benares hotel that is overrun with
half-starved stray cats. The hotel staff,
in accordance with the Hindu faith,
will not destroy them, although they do
lock about 50 of them in an empty
room without food or water in the
hope that God will do the rest. Instead,
they are freed by an irate European
who hears their symphony of miaows.
Pamela happens to see them totter
weakly out of the room, and despite the
fact that she doesn’t really like cats
she takes pity on some of the prettiest
kittens, feeding them meat and milk in
her room.
One is pregnant, she takes in more,
and before long her brief surge of
philanthropy has spawned consequences
beyond her control. By the time
Richard, who is away on business, has
returned, the feline collection has
grown to 38, and a distraught Pamela
can do nothing but contemplate the
chaos.
Her helplessness angers Richard, and
he refuses to deal with the situation for
her: “What you’ve done,” he told her,
“is stupid, sentimental, and self-
indulgent. The only thing that’s better
off is your conscience. You’ve simply
deprived the creatures of the power
to survive.” Pamela eventually drowns
the cats, much to her own horror and
that of the Hindus, but Richard’s words
remain as a commentary on his own be-
haviour toward her in their marriage.
When he finally decides on divorce,
so that he can marry the woman he
wants, Pamela retaliates with the most
negative act of all—suicide. The ghilt
she leaves behind cripples the Aus-
tralian woman’s resolve and she feels
she cannot inflict the same pain on her
own husband.
Self-sacrifice, Miss Halls is saying,
generates its own momentum, and its
victims are never predictable. And “in
the muddle of India” there is no
shortage of victims. One is Shankar, a
young friend of Richard’s who is mak-
ing a name for himself in the National
Film Board, until he wins a scholarship
to study documentary film-making
abroad. He is away for more than a
year, and when he returns his job has
been given to a man with none of his
ability. “Six hundred failed BAs and
half a dozen jobs ... In India the
biggest mistake you can make is not
to be there.”
Miss Halls never loses sight of her
theme, but it’s a measure of her skill
that she manages to cloak it in several
guises. One is also grateful that she
avoids the temptation of feminine intro-
spection, telling the story from
Richard’s point of view rather than
that of his mistress or his wife.
Diana Athill has no such compunc-
tions. “Don’t Look at Me Like That”
is in the full tradition of the modern
English feminists whose cry is not so-
much “give us right” as “spare our
feeling.”
Miss Athill’s heroine, Meg, does have
one -old-fashioned inhibition, although
she does her best to pretend it isn’t
there. She’s frigid, and her first affair
is more a matter of duty than enjoy-
ment or moral rebellion. But she man-
ages to surmount her lack of sexual
passion by falling in love with a
married man and being allowed to
suffer.
Miss Athill is 50 and, despite a col-
lection of short stories and an essay in
autobiography, this is her first novel.
She writes about women as percep-
tively as any of her younger counter-
parts, but there is a certain lack of
unity in the book. Not until the end
does it become clear that her attitude
toward her heroine is anything but one
of sympathy, and the final disapproval
has an unconvincing ring.
A CLASSICAL CASE
OK for Catullus to prate of cats r
piss and frangipanis
Or the Latin equivalents. Equally
OK for him
To get away with pederasty and
murder (in a sense).
He’s long gone and famous now who ,
no doubt, once was
A timorous type like myself —
In private a loud-mouth
Driven ranting to the back wall of
his burrow
There to round with a rodent’s teeth
On bigger and (relatively speaking)
better rodents.
There to bleed and rot or quick-
smart beat it
Into a silence redolent of lyrics.

SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
How not to
entertain a
visiting VIP
THE VISITING executive with
gourmet tastes suffers when in Aus-
tralia. No matter how skilled in the
ways of the table, how well versed with
wine, this worldly man returns home
with a briefcase better treated than
his palate. Our visitor has three un-
happy hurdles to overcome. Complete
entertainment, the expense account, and
time.
It is good that executives have a
fun-loving image makes the busi-
ness of business more relaxed but to
suggest that they also enjoy really fine
food is an infinitely more complicated
image to accept.
In such a short time how should
one “entertain” a visitor away from
the conference table? Inevitably the
arrangements are as detailed as an
operational order, seldom left for a
yes-no decision and always totally con-
suming. “Can’t let the fellow be bored
or feel he isn’t wanted.” But the
fellow just wants to be left alone to
walk the streets, to discover for himself
a small restaurant that perhaps serves
the true food of the area.
Poor fellow, he has to endure a sur-
feit of half - dressed girls with his
oysters, a Japanese black-and-white
minstrel with his Chateaubriand, and
even a Tahitian dancing team with his
bombe Alaska. All this in the interests
of fun-loving business entertainment!
Of course we do mean well it’s just
that the executive away from home is
seen, internationally, as incapable of
enjoying a quiet, beautifully prepared
meal.
On his second visit he obviously has
his feet on the ground and isn’t quite
as drowned by our good cheer. Good
eateries are known, contacts made, and
“Le Grand Bit” is not grabbed in
teeth. But the first visit presents the
problem, and here am I with the aim
of reducing the height of the hurdles
we put in his path.
Airlines have created the mad rush
and made it possible for the business
trip to be just that. Time is, as I was
told by a car dealer on a thousand-
acre dairy property . . . money. “But,”
said I, “so is your health.” He paused
a moment, grunted, and carried on
milking. He had purchased the farm
to gain leisure!
Is it too glib to say, add a day?
Because this is my slogan for every
single visit made by every single execu-
tive who values his health. By adding
one day and avoiding at all costs having
this day used for extended discussions,
he can breathe easily for a few hours
and discover his own special restaurant.
I have travelled over 45,000 miles in
the past seven months just looking for
this kind of eating place; not always
with success. The famous venues are
always the selection of the tourist
offices, and Australians are usually
classified as having American tastes.
How would you like to arrange an
itinerary for a VIP in Sydney, places
where he can sample the best of our
local produce presented in faultless
manner? You would need to base the
selection on your own experiences, and
if you are unaware of his tastes perhaps
you may include a nightclub or an
evening at the Cross just in case.
I set out to discover for myself
exactly what treatment a stranger can
expect. Armed with a rather pukka
accent, I rang several numbers asking
for advice on the best restaurant that
Sydney offers, especially where I might
eat the best local foods. Travel Head-
quarters were pleasant but regretted
that everyone was out at lunch. The
girl advised me to speak with the
“What’s on in Sydney” publishers. They
were most helpful, but gave me a list
of seven establishments that included
five of our worst restaurants.
Then, having asked for the best food,
I was offered: “Old convict house
good convict area brand new decor
old fashioned lovely view beaut
fountains.” “But I really want good
food it doesn’t matter about the
decor!” I was duly refered to the Gov-
ernment Tourist Bureau. Again most
friendly. “Hope you’re not after local
dishes there aren’t any other than
steak ’n eggs, not very elegant” (with
much mirth). “You should go to the
. . . it’s an old convict area.”
So I decided to try two techniques
I have used successfully overseas. I
rang the head porter at a very swish
hotel and asked for his advice. “Cer-
tainly, sir, the very best food can be
had at the ... it has an old convict
atmosphere . . .”
In desperation I fell back on a devi-
ous if not dastardly ruse. I rang the
most often recomjnended restaurant
needless to- say, the one with old con-
vict atmosphere, and spoke to the
owner in a snooty voice. “This is Mr.
Griffith-Jones’ personal secretary. Mr.
Jones dined incognito at your estab-
lishment last night and asked me to
pass on his compliments for your ex-
cellent service and splendid food.” The
owner was pleased, if a little puzzled.
“I wonder if I might ask you to
recommend another venue for Mr.
Jones, with the same excellent food—
the decor doesn’t really matter.” A
lengthy thoughtful pause ensued.
“It’s difficult,” he replied, “but I
would suggest you call Graham Kerr.”

What "good news"?
“Good news for the locals” (8., Jan.
27) isn’t as good as it could, or should,
be, since a high proportion of Aus-
tralia’s defence spending will still be
overseas.
Where, for instance, is the industry
capable of major overhauls of our
F-Ills and their highly sophisticated
systems? Who will overhaul, or produce
spares for, the mobile radar essential to
the operations of our Mirages?
Where is the Australian-designed, or
made, tank suitable for South-East
Asian operation? Where are our Austra-
lian-designed, or made, missiles, air-to-
air, air-to-ground, ground-to-ground, or
ground-to-air?
What Australian-designed gun has
the Army used since the World War
II Owen? What has happened to the
CAC C-31 design-study for a super-
sonic trainer, ground-support aircraft
for the 1970 s and ’Bos.
Have we the facilities for the pro-
duction of naval vessels above frigate
class? Where will our missile destroyers
go for major refits? The anti-tank
Ikara missile and the anti-submarine
missile amply demonstrate that we
have the talent to design, and the
ability to produce, such weapons. Why
aren’t there more? Or will they go the
way of the Jindivic of the ’sos, a bril-
liant start, but that’s all, a start?
Where is the man who will count
the loss to Australia for the failure to
develop such facilities or systems? It
forces us to depend on foreign nations
for spares. At present the three ser-
vices operate an amalgam of French,
British, Italian, Canadian, and Ameri-
can equipment; militarily we are the
United Nations. And from all this we
receive none of the benefits of new
industries or technological fall-out.
Sweden developed its own Saab and
Viggen aircraft, Israel developed its
own air-to-ground missile and sub-
machine-gun. We have developed the
art of buying overseas.

"I was a chalkie..."
Your correspondent Pamela Newton
(8., Feb. 17) asks why I stayed so long
as a teacher in a Catholic college. The
answer is pretty simple: I did it because
I wanted to. Which was just as well,
because there are certain factors which
inhibit the movement of teachers from
one independent school to another:
(1) The necessity to prove one’s
“stability” by staying put in one place,
no matter how poor the conditions, for

at least three years. Most independent
school principals would regard as sus-
pect any man who wanted to move
after only one year.
(2) The fact that there is no com-
mon superannuation scheme amongst
independent schools; when a teacher
moves from one school to another there
is almost invariably a loss of ultimate
superannuation benefit. One receives
back one’s previous contributions in a
lump sum, it is true, but one must
start afresh at the bottom of the new
school’s superannuation ladder if it
has one. The ultimate benefit at re-
tirement of the previous school’s contri-
butions is thereby lost.
1 am sorry that Pamela Newton
found those aspects of the Catholic
education system’s pedagogic indiges-
tion of which I wrote “confusing,”
although I suspect that future educa-
tional historians will find them not only
confusing but confounding.
At the same time, her suggestion
that I could make a good living by
writing funny stories was very much
appreciated. I fear, however, that the
delivery of over 8000 lessons to con-
fined groups of Catholic adolescentia
during a five-year period has drained
the well-springs of inspiration almost
dry.

Our man in...
Just a few lines concerning an article
(8., Jan. 27) about Australia treating
Britain as simply another foreign
country. The suggestion was made that
the high commissioners be made am-
bassadors. I believe, though, that this
was gone into back in the late ’forties
when India became a republic, and
in so far as Australia is concerned, and
other “monarchies,” such could hardly
be, as an ambassador represents the
head of state. Obviously it could hardly
be that Queen Elizabeth as Australian
head of state could be represented to
herself as United Kingdom head of
state! This is avoided in the case of
high commissioners, who represent only
their governments.
Of course, to my way of thinking,
all this is so much foolishness. Let this
country become a republic and stand
forth in the world in its own right, with
its leaders in the clear, no ceiling over
the head of every last Australian in
that no one can aspire to the high
position of head of state, etc. I also
note the article about the procedure for
awarding military decorations to mem-
bers of the forces and how ridiculous
all that is. Let this whole matter be
settled by having such things taken care
of entirely in Australia, and all decor-
ations being Australian and from no
other country!
As a fellow American citizen, I’ve
just written to Mrs. Gorton and urged
her not to become a naturalised Aus-
tralian, if she has not done so already.
Please don’t misunderstand. It is not
that I am against Australia or being
an Australian citizen, if that were all
there were to it I am against British
subjection, and it is'that part of the
process which is far more important
legally. It is that feature which abso-
lutely prevents me from considering
any change from my valued U.S.
citizenship. I would not be anybody’s
subject, no matter how nominally I
would wear no one’s collar, no matter
how loose. I would neither hug nor
allow near me any chain, even a paper
one!
Anyway, keep up the good work of
showing up the humbug which is a
feature of the British connection and
which helps to retard this country’s
development. Yours for an Australian
republic.

S.A.'s social welfare
Commenting on Miss Price’s letter
(8., Feb. 24), there can be no reason-
able doubt that South Australia now
leads the way in social welfare: but
on the other hand I know of no plans
of the Dunstan Government to take
measures to ensure that family social
workers understand the details and
dimensions of the new Social Welfare
provisions. That, it seems, -may be a
serious weakness in an otherwise com-
mendable program.

Masons and Catholics
The article “Masons & Catholics” in
the January 13 issue of The Bulletin is
most timely and appreciated. It is a pro-
gressive sign when the worshipful
leaders of the ancient and honorable
order spare a thought for the future
survival of the fraternity which calls
for the outlawing of the sectarian
“muck-rake” and a more human
understanding, not only between
“Masons and Catholics” but in the fel-
lowship of the human race.
The free world is today starving for
the factual history of the fate of the
Anglo-Saxon Brotherhood of Mankind,
founded on the Chair of Saint Augustine
and the Latin fathers, and universally
acknowledged for over a thousand years
as “the salt of the earth.”
What happened to it?
All documental evidence of its exist-
ence is now buried in the dust of
oblivion in the London Museum, the
sacred property of the Premier Grand
Masonic Lodge of England.

Taronga Zoo
Mr. Highham suffered from muddled
thinking when he wrote “The future is
bullish at Taronga” (8., Feb. 10)..
Take, for example, these two sentences:
“Despite the improvements he has
already brought about, the Zoo looks
altogether better-swept, the animals
are just beginning to be better housed.
Strahan admits that the drains are
poor, the water system fails to work,
and the ferry wharf is in ghastly shape”;
“Animals aren’t, just because they are
in a zoo, tame; not even the fish,
which, the aquarium keeper told me,
often violently attack each other if
they’re left too long together in small
tanks, and will even tear and rend
their own species.”

Willoughby, N.S.W.
One of Australia's
missing parts
“Observer’s” comment (8., Feb. 24)
criticising Australia’s failure to bring
the Philippines closer into the orbit
of her foreign policy answers itself
when he states that the Philippines
“shelter more fully under the wings
of the American eagle than we do.”
In the days before many organs-
of the mass media of communication
built up a fantasy of so-called world
opinion and the idea of projecting
national images (real or false), the
blunt statement that the Philippines-
lie within the American sphere of in-
fluence would have served your cor-
respondent’s purpose.
Such spheres of influence still exist,
with the amount of influence exerted
dependent on the force or threat of
force wielded by the influencing power.
Australia’s influence in South-East Asia,
like Russia’s in the Middle East, will
depend on the armed forces which
she can deploy.
