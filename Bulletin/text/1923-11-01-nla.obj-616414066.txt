The Poet as Teacher
To me, I must confess, the poet and the
teacher are quite different persons. I would
no more think of going to the poet for what
generally goes under the name of instruc-
tion than I would of going to my grand-
mother for an outline of the discoveries of
modern* science or for the speculations of
modern philosophy.
Those wlio imagine that they are exalt-
ing the poet by"representing him as a teacher
have a mistaken view of the nature and
function of poetry.
Sir William Watson represents the poet
as sitting
above the clang and dust of lime
With the world’s secret trembling on his lips..
The “world’s secret” may tremble on his
lips, but, if I have read the history of
thought aright, it has never got beyond them.
It is as much hidden from the poet as trom
the rest of us. Nor is he necessarily a very
profound philosopher, or a very learned
scientist, or even, in tlie ordinary sense, a
very wise man. It is notorious that poets
have been of every shade and variety of creed
and opinion. There have been Con-
servative poets and Radical poets, reli-
gious poets and irreligious poets, pessi-
mistic poets and optimistic poets, poets
who have loved liberty with fanatical
fervor and poets who have cringed to
tyrants, poets who have been keen men ot
business and poets w T ho have been imprac 1-
cal fools. Poets, in a word, differ like the
rest of us, because they are subject to the
same limitations, and are the victims ot the
same prejudices and passions, lhey are not
God-like. They are human, mostly very
' lU The "claim that the poet has in some mys-
terious way discovered the world s secret,
m refuted by the fact that some of the
greatest poetry is the expression of the in-
scrutable mystery of things, lake bhaks-
peare’s
We are such stuff .
As dreams are , made on, and our little me
Is rounded with a sleep.
That is fine poetry. , But, far from being a
revelation of the mystery ot things, it is
a frank admission that no such revelation
i.s possible. The view that knowledge of
the “wold’s secret” is part ot the poet s
equipment is utterly refuted by the fact that
some of our greatest poetry affirms that that
secret can never be known.
The function of the poet is not to instruct,
but to inspire. He does net add to our
knowledge; he gives us a deeper sense or
the things we already know. He does not
tell us new truths;' lie gives ns an acuter
sense of the old ones. He reveals, if he re-
veals at all, the beauty of things, not tlie
truth of things. And he can hardly be said
to do even that. For it may be held .that
he creates the beauty that lie paints, lhe
glamor he throws over all things is the
glamor of his own soul. 1t_ is 1 the light that
never was on sea or land that is to say,
the light of his own imagination. To again
quote Watson :
The poet gathers fruit from every tree,
Yea, grapes from thorns and figs from thistles, he .
At his touch the meanest weed that grows
Tow'ers to a lily, reddens to a rose.
The poet reveals, not the Universe, but
himself, which is infinitely more interesting.
Embedded in all the tvorld’s great poetry is,
not the secret of the Cosmos, but something
far more enthralling—-the secret of the
poet’s soul, and, for that very reason, the
secret of the soul of every one of us. Tor
the poet is really ourselves—ourselves be-
come articulate and gifted with the_ power
of making music and song out of the joys
and sorrows of our lives.
I like to think of the poet, not as a
philosopher grappling with the riddle of life,
nor as a scientist wresting from Nature her
reluctant secrets, nor as a sage sitting away
up in the cold altitudes of wisdom looking
dow r n with scorn off tlie follies of men, but
as one of ourselves, feeling as we feel, but
with greater intensity ; seeing as we see, but
with clearer vision; hating as we hate, and
loving as we love, but with more poignant
passion. There is something of the child
in all poets, just as there is something of
the poet in all children. Every child is
poet-hearted, for to tlie child-mind every-
thing is now and strange, and, therefore, full
of magic and romance. As we grow old and
experience day by day for years the same
emotions satiety steals upon our souls., We
become blase. The magic goes out of life.
The old tune, once enthralling, becomes tedi-
ous. Then comes the poet with bis splendid
super-sensitiveness, bis_ cluld-like capacity
for seeing romance in simple things, his gift
of putting his emotions into a song, and,
above all, his power to infect us with liis
own spirit; and, lo! he restores to us our
lost universe, and gives us back its vanished
glory!
Far from regarding the poets, with Shel-
ley. as *“the unacknowledged legislators of man-
kind,” or. with others, as the great inter-
preters. 1 prefer to regard them as the un-
sophisticated children of Nature who never
quite grow up; to whom the world is au
unfading fairyland, life a thrilling adven-
ture, love a heart-stirring romance; the
universe a sort of colossal box of toys.
I do not mean to suggest by anything I
have said that a poet may not be a man
of powerful and original intellect. That
would be to forget Shelley, Goethe, Burns
and others. Great poetry implies great
qualities of mind. Still, just as a man may
be a great thinker, without being a great
poet, so a man may be a great poet without
being a great thinker. To some extent the
very qualities which go to malfe a man a
great poet disqualify him from being an
• accurate reasoner. The poet’s thoughts are
steeped in emotion. In a sense, he thinks
with li is heart. He gives free rein to his
imagination. He is more concerned with
beauty than with truth. Accordingly, while
the poets have often been men of great men-
tal power, the world has rightly classed
them as artists rather than as thinkers or
philosophers, and lias gone to them for joy
and solace, not for instruction and Wisdom.
WALLACE NELSON.
In Defence of Musical Ignorance
I liave listened, just as a listener, to a
jreat deal of music, and 1 have decided that
;here is more pure nonsense talked about
it than any other of the arts. The real
‘lover of music” always abhors popular
lieces such as sentimental ballads and lilt-
ng dance tunes. These, it is explained, are
too obvious, too simple, too definitely rhyth-
mical to thrill the soul of one who has
‘appreciation” of good music. Good music
is, of course, classical music, and only the
favored few are able to rise to the Olympian
heights of appreciation. But suppose you
analyse one of those classical pieces that
thrill the souls of the music-lovers. I do not
mean analysing its technique. There is too
much of that and too many people who
know all about technique. Suppose you
analyse the sound that it makes when it is
played, for that is all that interests me.
Take any one of the whole list of approved
classical pieces, that are played and appre-
ciated by the smug middle-class “music-
lovers” and you will find running through it
a certain very definite theme. “Theme” may
not be the technical name for it, but I want
to get away from technicalities, it sounds
like a theme, so I call it a theme. At times
it becomes very distinct, in some composi-
tions it is distinct throughout, but this is
supposed to be bad. The super-classical
pieces have* this theme so completely dis-
guised that one needs to hear the item
played a number of times before one can
recognise it at all. To be able to recognise
it and to smile approval is to qualify as a
truly orthodox music-lover. But once that
theme is discerned through the thick fog
of meaningless runs and clever finger exer-
cises, it becomes evident that the theme it-
self is nothing else than the tune of a sen-
timental ballad or a dance that could easily
become popular. What makes the piece
classical are the trimmings —those meaning-
less, tiring, monotonous displays of musical
verbiage that make the piece hard to play
and the theme hard to discern. Eliminate
them and, in most cases, you would have
the air of a sentimental ballad.
There was a time when literature was
like that. The reading public began to, grow
at an alarming rate soon after the printing
business became established, and those intel-
lectuals who had felt themselves very high
on the scale of social distinction due to their
ability to read saw the exclusiveness gradu-
ally slipping from them. At about that
period the writer who wished to win the
approval of these was forbidden to say what
he meant in language that was easily under-
stood. He was expected to ransack his
memory and the dictionaries for long, little-
known words and to use these instead of the
shorter, simpler and more definite ones. He
was expected to string long phrases upon
one another and, if possible, to spread one
sentence over an ♦entire page. He had to
go into his subject in a round-about manner
and only come to his point gradually, and
to be very careful not to make quite clear
what the point really was. In this man-
ner only the cultivated were allowed to
understand what they read, and thus their
prestige as the only true patrons of litera-
ture was preserved for a time. It was only
after Hazlitt, .Lamb and Wordsworth had
rebelled against these standards that we got
honest writing.
That is what is happening to music.
Until recent years musical instruments and
musical training were available only to the
few. Music was to them a symbol of social
superiority. But now new methods of
manufacture and more liberal industrial
conditions have placed these things within
the reach of most. Almost every home has
its piano; many have their violins; People
do not, however, spend money on pianos and
violins and expensive lessons because they
really love music ; they spend it because they
love and desire social prestige', and these
things are to their minds the symbols of it.
They are finding now that the significance
of music as an exclusive possession is being
destroyed by the custom of teaching it to
everyone. So, to protect and prolong their
exclusive right to pose as the appreciators
of music, they rear these standards of class-
icism. Classical music as it is understood
to-day is simply verbosity translated on to
the music-stall.
The musicians who are worshipped by our
critics and patrons of music are not neces-
sarily people of artistic insight. They are,
in most cases, merely technicians with ab-
normal wrists or throats. They have by
long practice and natural adaptability ac-
quired the knack of performing gymnastics
with their hands or voices. Thus they are
able to render without flaw all the sense-
less trills and complicated runs called for
by the composers of our disguised senti-
mental ballads. They do not interpret. To
interpret would be to cut out all the super-
fluous verbiage and leave the theme bare
and undisguised. That would not only call
down upon them the anger of the critics and
patrons; it would rob them of their own
calling as well, for there are very few of
these compositions that could not be ren-
dered by a 10-year-old girl had they only
been written in a straightforward and
honest manner. Besides, these musicians
are not interested in interpreting the music
they play. Their trade is to reveal their
marvellous technique, which means that their
trade is to perform musical acrobatic tricks.
Most of our musical criticism is technical.
That is because the business of-the critic is
to keep music exclusive. If you eliminate
from almost any current musical criti-
cism the inane remarks about technique,
you will find there is nothing of importance
left; and what is left is pure platitude. A
few there are who try to write sane criti-
cism, but they are not popular with the
music-lovers. They have not flattered the
musical aristocrat’s sense of exclusiveness.
When he reads such an article he realises
that almost anyone could understand it, and
that alarms him. But such critics are rare,
and the reason is plain. They have found
that unless they talk of technique there is
nothing to talk of at all.
This does not mean that music is a lost
art or that it is decadent. It means that

music is slowly being freed from class-donn-
nation, and that the autocrats of the musi-
cal world are struggling to keep their grip
upon it. But their grip is becoming weaker,
and it may not be long before we will have
real music. Just what it will be like can-
not be said, but we may feel certain that it
will be something very much better than the
obscure technicalities of the present-day
classicism. When analysed the writings ot
the learned in the days of verbose literature
reveal very little beneath the verbosity.
Wealth of meaning and charm of expres-
sion came only when the old standards had
been rejected. And when we have succeeded
in rejecting the futile profundity of our
modern musical standards, we may with
reason hope to find in music the beauty and
the splendor that we now seek but so sel-
dom find.
LESTER WAY.
Tolstoy’s Last Days
After the defeat of the White armies, the
Bolshevik Government, which had been per-
secuting Tolstoy’s followers—his daughter
Alexandra had been sent to prison, and his
works proscribed—now feeling its position
more secure, began to adopt a more tolerant
attitude. Alexandra was appointed custo-
dian of the Tolstoyan museum at Yasnaya
Polyana, and a publishing company was
formed to bring out a complete edition of
Tolstoy’s works under the editorship of
Vladimir Tchertkoff, who reserved the right
to withhold any matter which he might not
deem it expedient to publish. This contract
was intended to put an end to all the dis-
putes which had been raging over Tolstoy’s
will, in which he had bequeathed his works
to the nation. Some time ago the “Central
Co-operative” of Moscow issued a book by
Tchertkoff entitled “Tolstoy’s Flight.” In
this work the author revealed tbe secret
causes which drove Tolstoy to abandon his
home and set out on the pilgrimage which
ended in his death at the little wayside sta-
tion of Astapovo. The publication of the
book gave rise to a furious polemic. Some
applauded Tchertkoff’s action ; others, in-
cluding members of the Tolstoy family and
some friends, made a violent attack on bim —
notably Tolstoy’s son Leo, in a series of
articles in Figaro. Whether Tchertkoff
acted rightly or not in making public mat-
ters of so private and intimate a nature, the
fact remains that he has given the world a
human document of the greatest importance.
He reproduces the most intimate pages of
Tolstoy’s diary—thoughts which Tolstoy never
during his lifetime, dared reveal to anyone.
He kept them in a notebook which was never
allowed to go out of his possession.
“I kept silent for 10 years,” Tchertkoff
writes in The Last Days of Tolstoy (Heine-
mann), “but now I feel the time has come
to state frankly what I know.” His 10
years’ silence he explains by his unwilling-
ness to reveal things which would hurt the
feelings of Tolstoy’s wife. Sofya Andreyevna.
Sofya died in 1919, and Tchertkoff felt that
the barrier to further silence on his part was
now removed. He tells us that his chief
motive for speaking out is derived from the
fact that history shows that it is difficult if
not impossible to get at the truth about any
event after the death of all the contemporary
witnesses. “The true story of Tolstoy’s life
must be preserved for future generations.”
For years Tolstoy had suffered much
heartbreak from the contrast between his
life of luxury and domestic quarrels and his
published teachings. As far back as 1895
lie wrote a letter of farewell to his wife, in
which he declared his intention of leaving
bis home. He did not, however, carry out
his intention. He was surrounded in his
home by a silent hostility which he felt bit-
terly. To his friend Novikoff he confided in
1910: “I have never hidden from you that
in this house I have suffered the torments
of Hell, and that for a long time I have de-
sired to leave it and retire to some quiet
spot in a forest.... But God has not given
me the strength to break with my family.
My weakness is perhaps a fault, but I can-
not make others suffer for my own nersonal
satisfaction.” The idea of leaving Yasnaya
Polyana was then abandoned for a while.
A month before his flight he wrote again
to Novikoff: “I will not die in this house.
I have made up my mind to go away to some
unknown place, and perhaps in tlie end I
shall die in your hut.” He fled from home
on a night in October, 1910, but he had not
gone very far when he was forced to stop at
Astapovo, stricken by a mortal illness. There
he died on November 10, attended by liis
friend Dr. Makovitzky.
Tolstoy’s influence in Russia was enor-
mous. All classes, from the Czar down, felt
it. He was to tbe Russian what Voltaire
and the Encyclopaedists were to the French
Revolution. Peasants, soldiers, officials,
nobles, priests and working-men all saw the
force of his attack on the Government, and
in spite of its enormous power the ruling
class -was unable to summon to its defence
sufficient support to maintain its hold on
the country. When the revolution broke out
the whole machinery of government toppled
to the ground like a rotten tree.

The Federal Capital Territory
To a great many people Canberra is a
collection of foundation-stones and very
little else. But that the district is also
rich in historical associations is proved by
a little book of 90 pages entitled Canberra,
the work of W. Davis Wright (John Andrew
and Co., Sydney). Mr. Wright was born in
the neighborhood in 1841, and is one of the
oldest surviving sons of original settlers.
Back in 1800 the authorities comman-
deered two vessels lying in Sydney Harbor,
and sent them to Java for supplies of rice
to relieve a food-shortage then becoming
serious at Parramatta and elsewhere in the
young settlement. The vessels, which were
lost on the voyage, belonged to Robert Camp-
bell, who had arrived in Sydney in 1796.
After a lapse of no less than 23 years Mr
Campbell was granted 7000 ewes by the
then Government as compensation for his
lost ships. He commissioned an ex-officer
ot the Bcots Greys, named Ainsli*e, who had
touglit at Waterloo, to choose a suitable
area of land for the sheep. Ainslie eventu-
ally settled at Kamberry, a s the aboriginals
called it, in 1823, and formed the first stock
settlement m th e district. The meaning of
the native word Kamberry seems _to have
been lost. The little town of Ainslie re-
mains as a memorial to the first white man
to see the district.
Mr. Wright has divided his booklet into
sections, each section being the history ot
one of the early families. There are over
20 of them, and many of their descendants
are residents still. Duntroon, now the site
of the Military College, was originally the
homestead Piallago, built by Robert Camp-
bell, and there are Campbells still living
within sight of the old homestead. Captain
Alured Tasker Faunce, who became the first
police-magistrate at Queanbeyan, in 1837,
and Commissary-General Ryrie, grandfather
of Major-General Granville _ Ryrie, are
two other names associated with this early
history. Lake George was found to be quite
dry when traversed by Charles McKechnie,
another early settler, in 1838. A number
of years later fish were introduced to the
lake by Terence Murray, the original holder
of Yarralumba. His old homestead, now
called Yarrolumla, is where the visiting
politicians of to-day are housed during their
stay in the Federal territory. Murray gave
the world two distinguished sons —Gilbert,
the Professor of Greek; and Hubert, for
many years past Administrator of Papua.
Of still earlier inhabitants of the Federal
Territory Mr. Wright gives us a few
glimpses. He describes a fight he witnessed
between two blackfellows in a yard along-
side the kitchen of Tuggranong Homestead,
10 miles from Queanbeyan. The natives
were armed with nulla-nullas and shields,
and after seven rounds, during which only
one blow actually got home, one of the pair
bolted. (Tuggranong Homestead now houses
the historian of Australia’s part in the war,
Mr. C. E. W. Bean, and his staff.) As a
lad he was in terror, he tells us, of “Hong
Kong,” chief of the Kamberry tribe. Once
he overheard Hong Kong order his. gin to
carry his spears. She refused, saying she
had to carry the piceanniny. Plainly the
easy way was to get rid of the piceanniny.
So her lord swung the child round by the
ankles and dashed its head against a tree,
after which he threw the body to the ants.
For residents of the district “Canberra”
should prove of fascinating interest ; and as
the capital grows out of the foundation-stone
stage, the little history is bound to be in
demand among students and collectors of
Australiana.
G. B. LOWERY.
The Words that Spoil the View
Middleton Murry is probably right when
he writes in the Adelpiii that romanticism
“is itself the English tradition,” and that
the modern classicism —so called —"is no
more important than an exotic fashion in
trousers.” Yet even such a downright state-
ment does not deal fully with the position.
Romanticism was certainly the moving
force of the best achievements of the Eng-
lish mind. Rut why give that force a name
at all? The moment you come to look for
definite examples of romanticism and classic-
ism you discover that in all the higher
fields of literature they arc inextricably
mixed. Get down to bedrock and the two
terms at most only represent two moods of
a single mind. It is so with nearly all the
words that stand for a complex idea. Thus
one writer tells us that iShakspeare was a
“medievalist,” as if that term placed him in
a separate glass-case and definitely labelled
him forever. Sliakspeare has great feeling
for the Middle Ages, it is true, and great
sympathy with the ideas on which that
period tried to work out its economic,
national and moral salvation ; but he has
the same kind of understanding sympathy
for ancient times, and now and again he
becomes utterly modern. Milton’s method is.
Greek till he comes to the point where Greek
method and that of the romantic English
ballad blend and are one. Eift out special
passages from their setting, and they are as
racy of the woodlands and hedge-rows as the
work of the lyric dramatists who preceded
►Shakspeare; for those dramatists also were
touched by the far finger of Greece, through
Italy and the new English translations of
the classics.
Classicism and romanticism may have a
real meaning in French literature, but even
in its most modern guise the work of Eng-
lish writers refuses to be grouped and classi-
fied. A romanticism which will include
Wordsworth, Tennyson and Coleridge and
exclude (Swinburne is every way ridiculous.
To suppose that we have come into a new
era of letters is to imagine an altogether
vain thing. The whole progress of the
craft is continuous; the fashions have lasted
a season, but there are no more “schools” of
literature than there are of life. Thirty
years ago the works on literature placed in
the hands of students were full of “schools.”
One belonged to the “Lake School,” another
to the "School of Pope and Dryden,” a
third —and this was the most wonderful
grouping of all —-to the “School of Byron
and Shelley.” Painfully the student sought
to find the points in common that made
Coleridge, Wordsworth, Southey, Scott,
Leigh Hunt and a few otners a group set
apart. Why, they naturally asked, was
Shelley not included in the list? Could any
voice be more like Shelley’s than that of
Coleridge in his “Ode to France”? Did not
Shelley and Wordsworth both maunder
about dull things in much the same fashion?
And if Scott was allowed in, why was
Byron shut out? Did not Byron largely
follow the pathway Scott had shown him?
There is nothing more individual than
literature. There is no writer of real con-
sequence from first to last whose work is
like another’s —if we except the dramatists
of the Elizabethan and Jacobean times,
whose similarities were probably due to the
compulsion of the primitive theatre of the
time. Shelley and Wordsworth approach,
but there is no mistaking them. In Shel-
ley’s throat there is always a reedy flute;
Wordsworth’s voice grows very thick and
husky. To call Pope and Dryden close kin
is to insult the brave old John, who could
be incoherent and ragged but never mincing.
A little time ago we read much in our news-
papers about the Australian this, that or
the other English writer. A certain sort of
dull critic always conceived of writers
appearing in pairs at some distance of space
or time, and was never satisfied unless he
could group them or compare them. That is a
foolish business and much to be deplored;
so is every attempt to make a drawing-room
or class-room chatter out of names and
phrases which are supposed to have a cata-
logue value. There can be no harm in say-
ing that Keats is like a younger Milton;
but the article on Keats that makes a
separate comparison of Keats with each
writer whom he resembles in a single line
is guilty of an irritating waste of words.
After the biographer with too much to say,
the critic with nothing to say is about the
worst literary disease from which we suffer.
Cut out the groupings, the classification
names and the useless comparisons, and most
critics who have nothing to say will be un-
able to write it.
DAVID MCKEE WEIGHT.
M. H. Molony says the last word: —
In his second article on Oghams Mr. Wright
quotes me as saying that “nobody of consequence,
known to me, except Mr. Wright and the ancient
bards, suggests that Ogham was in existence
before Christianity.” It would seem that he
thinks I was an ass egregious enough to write
my .notes on his article without having familiar-
ised myself with the chapter on early Irish
writing in Dr. Douglas Hyde’s “History.” The
root of the trouble is that he confuses what I meant
when I said “before Christianity” with what the
authorities he cites from Hyde’s book meant when
they said “pre-Christian.” I meant, literally, before
Christ; they meant before the introduction of Christi-
anity into Ireland, in the fourth or fifth century after
Christ. The Ogham controversy at that time circled
about the hypothesis put forward by Bishop Graves,
an eminent scholar, who had practically discovered
the key to the interpretation of Ogham script. Dr.
Graves maintained that the Oghams were all post-
Christian —between the fifth and seventh centuries.
The authorities cited by Mr. Wright were concerned
to show, and did show, that most of them were pre-
Christian—that is, before the fifth century—and
many probably pagan. One of the little ironies of
criticism is illustrated by the fact that Professor
Mac Neil is rapped over the knuckles almost as
smartly by Mr. Wright asi I am—pushes the date of
origin of the Oghams much farther back in pagan
times than the relevant authorities cited by Mr.
Wright. Professor Mac Neill thinks the Oghams
came into being contemporaneously with Christi-
anity, or very shortly after. Arbris de Jubanville
does not “take their pagan origin for granted” in
suggesting that a pagan of the fifth century would
know them. On the other hand he does assert that
they were based on Latin. I don’t know why Mr.
Wright cites Whitley Stokes, whose remark, that
certainly some of the Celts could write their own
language before the fifth century, gives no support
at all to his case. Douglas Hyde himself is almost
equally useless to him. He dates Ogham from about the
second century, says it is unquestionably of Irish
origin and peculiar to the Irish Gael, and that
there can be no doubt it is based upon the Roman
alphabet.
“Exul”: I entirely disagree with “M.B.’s” asser-
tion (B. 27/9/’23) that “the study of a language,
being merely a means to an end to be obtained with
infinitely more interest and less labor by the read-
ing of translations, is a process which in itself
possesses little nr no cultural value.” As a mental
discipline and a means of instilling accurate habits
of thought there is nothing to equal language
study. To write a composition in Latin, for instance,
demands a nice appreciation of the 'exact meaning
not only of Latin but also of English words and
phrases, and so indirectly teaches the student to under-
stand his own language better. I agree that children
are taught “too many frills” nowadays, but Latin
and Greek don’t come under that heading. Too
often are professional men horrible bores because
they are unable to talk intelligently about anything
but “shop.” Although their classical authors are
seldom disturbed now, I am quite sure that those of
my medical friends who, like myself, worked hard
at the classics in their youth would not exchange
for much fine gold the richness of thought and bioad-
ness of outlook that have resulted to them from then-
labors. It is never the man who has studied the
classics who belittles their educational value ; that is
always done by those who haven’t and who don t
know what they’ve missed.
“Wilfrido”: Apropos of prohibited reading matter,
a Maoriland friend of mine paid a year’s subscrip-
tion to La Vie Parisienne. He found the numbers
came very irregularly and those that did arrive were
frayed and dirty. Meeting- a post-office official, be
mentioned the matter. “The magazine is pro-
hibited,” he was told; “but we don’t mind letting
a few through occasionally, because the clerks like
to have a look at them. Only, when they get hold
of them, you must take your chances of receiving
them. If you complain, they will be stopped alto-
gether.” He pursued his investigations further, to
find that the practice adopted in the Government
department had been followed by his own employees,
who placed the copies on his table after they had
been the rounds of the office.
A Satchel of Books
Historic Cambridge (W. Heffer and Sons). A book-
let containing a pencil-sketch by J. M. Delbos, and
a brief note of each of the colleges. L. F. Salzmau
supplies a foreword.
Stories of Love and Laughter, by Muriel Hine
(John Lane). Half of the dozen short stories in
this book make a more or less connected narrative;
the others have no connection with the parties next
door. The material is mostly thin; but this prolific
writer has her big public, and knows how to give if
light entertainment.
The Tale of the Old Temple, by J. E. Magraw
(T. Maskew Miller, Cape Town). Though written
and published in S. Africa, there is nothing “colonial”
about this story of rural England—a story of such
extraordinary simplicity that, but for a single ini i-
dent, one might have believed it the work of a 17-
year-old convent schoolgirl. There is no sense of
reality about it; and the writer goes through his
200-odd pages on stilts.
The Shorn Lamb, by Emma Speed Sampson (Reilly
and Lee, Chicago). Another of Mrs. Sampson’s nigger
stories; and there is insight and a quiet humor in
them all. She knows something besides the nigger,
too—she knows what the nigger is liable to do for
the white family. There is a fine contrast here in
the Taylors and the Bollings, who, with their depen-
dants, 'fill a book which is cordially recommended to
those who are interested in black-labor experiments
in general, and in Uncle Sam’s tremendous problem
in particular.
The Road to Delhi, by R. J. Minney (John Lane).
Judged as a story, there is too much preaching in
this; but if you want to be interested in a person
while you get solid and sane instruction in recent
political developments in India, you can’t do better
than read about Motihari, the little brown kid who
was picked up on the road to Delhi and taken io
Calcutta. And while you are getting acquainted
with Motihari and the tremendously important In-
dian problem, Minney runs off on his screen a suc-
cession of most enlightening- views of the Indian
mind.
The Strange Attraction, by Jane Mander (John
Lane). Here is a vivid story of the struggle between
love and the desire for freedom in the person of an
attractive Maoriland girl. The scene is laid in a
country town in the Auckland district, and Miss
Mander has got the right atmosphere and peopled
it with the right kind of folks. And, indeed, nobody
could know more about the make-up of those same
Enzed towns, for Jane grew up in Whangarei. Being
her dad’s daughter she had to have an election fight
in her novel, with Massey triumphing over Joe Ward.
For sheer lyric beauty Jane’s descriptions of the
Maoriland bush will take a lot of beating.

The Passing
of the Horse
Slowly but surely the horse is
passing from the farm life of
the nations.
Every lover of Dobbin may sin-
cerely regret this, but modern
farming conditions make it im-
perative.
Sentiment cannot stay the on-
ward march of progress.
Horse labour is such a vital
factor in the cost of production
that it must be considered.
With the increased price of feed
and care and the larger invest-
ment in animals, the question cf
costs becomes an important one.
Animal power has a very low
efficiency, it is subject to
disease, needs careful attention
during the entire year, and is
seriously affected by climatic
changes.
Mechanical power is supplanting
animal power for the very prac-
tical reason that it is more
fficient and more economical.
Progress demands £More Vower!
The CASE Tractor supplies a full
measure of pcrwer for farm 'work
One reason why CASE Tractors are superseding horses is because they can supply
more power* Not only that —the power supplied by the CASE is more reliable,
more efficient, more economical*
This increase of power means better farming and eliminates many inconveniences
of old methods which make farm work like slavery*
The CASE requires attention only when in operation, and such is its mechanical
efficiency that even then it requires only a minimum amount of attention.
The CASE is the only power required on the farm and every CASE owner can
draw on CASE Service whenever required*

“Gentlemen, you are mighty poor
Business Men!”
This remark came out during a departmental conference in a wealthy
company. It helps to explain why executives are turning to the
Alexander Hamilton Institute in larger numbers than ever before.
IN the quiet, almost luxurious,
directors’ room, the depart-
ment heads of a certain large
manufacturing company were
called together by the general
manager.
One after another the produc-
tion manager, the purchasing
agent, the head of the planning
department, and the sales man-
ager expressed themselves. The
burden of each man s excuse
was the same: “If I had received
proper co-operation from the
other departments, we would
have met our quota easily.”
The general manager spoke
last, a keen, aggressive man of
38, who had been brought in
from outside.
“Gentlemen, you have told
me far more than you imagine,
he said. “It’s perfectly clear
what is the matter with this con-
cern. You men have forgotten
that it is a business and not
merely a collection of depart-
ments. You are first-class
specialists, experts in your own
departments, but
Gentlemen, you are mighty poor
business men.”
This was met with dead
silence and angry glares.
“I’ll repeat it,” the general
manager said. “You —all of you
—are poor business men. You’re
a group of stars, but you aren’t a
team. Each of you knows his
own viewpoint; he knows his
work and knows it well. But you
do not know enough about each
other’s problems to make this
company an effective business
unit.
“The sales department must
know more about production
and accounting and costs; the
production department must
think more in terms of sales and
credits- —each one of you must
get more vision of business as a
whole, in all its varied and inter-
related departments. That s
what this company needs, and it
needs it badly.’
The next day, at the general
manager’s invitation, a repre-
sentative of the Alexander
Hamilton Institute visited that
office, and every departmental
head enrolled for the Modern
Business Course and Service.
More than 24,000 Managing
Directors Enrolled.
The Alexander Hamilton In-
stitute was founded 1 1 years
ago by a group of business
leaders, who recognised that
modern business was tending to
produce specialists rather than
to develop executives.
Its appeal has been always to
successful men, to men of
mature years, who had already
made a favorable start in their
chosen line of work. More than
24,000 company heads have en-
rolled with it during the last 1 1
years, many of them along with
their most trusted associates.
This is the significant thing,
however; in the past six months
the number of enrolments re-
ceived by the Institute has been
larger than at any similar period
in its history; the average age
of the men enrolling has been
higher; their present position in
business higher on the average
than every before.
As never before, the leaders
of business enterprises are de-
manding better business training
for themselves and for the men
on whom they most depend.
Will You Spend an Evening
with the Facts?
The facts about the Institute’s
Course and Service are con-
densed into a booklet that aims
to answer ever}r question which
a thoughtful, ambitious man is
likely to raise.
To promote a wider under-
standing of its training, its pur-
poses and its results, the Institute
offers a copy of this booklet to
any reader of this publication
who will request it. In a single
evening you can have the full
facts. The booklet is called
“Forging Ahead in Business.”
It will inspire you, it will cheer
you, it will guide you; but do not
waste your time or ours unless
you are ready to do your part.
We ask you to send for this book
because we want you to take the
Alexander Hamilton Institute
Modern Business Course, and to
benefit by its service of guidance
and tuition. We frankly state
we have no desire to waste time
with the “curious” man or
woman. Those who interest us
and whom this Institute can
serve are they whose earnest
ambition is to WORK their pas-
sage to the top and out from
mediocrity. If you are one of
this class, your copy of “Forging
Ahead in Business” is waiting
your command at this very
moment. Write your name in

The Artist.
The darkness of the night has ceased ;
The shadow on his canvas faints,
And on the palette of the east
The artist Day has flung his paints.
The scene with magic brush he sweeps;
Rich colors everywhere he showers;
And on his widespread canvas leaps
The red and gold of clustered flowers.
On ragged walls he puts a sheen
Of russet light; he paints the sea
With white-capped waves, blue, fair and
clean,
And cool, green depths of mystery.

Hibiscus.
The pale hibiscus, where the water creams
Upon the beach, leans down and from
above
Sheds yellow silken blossoms that the breeze
Bears to the restless, softly-sighing seas —
Petals as frail as any ship of dreams,
As frail as any woman’s ship of love.
Like lily cups upon the foam they float,
Dewed with the sparkling silver salt-sea
spray,
Soft saffron petals on a sapphire sea,
All ocean cradled, rocking slumbrously
On gentle tides, each one a golden boat
Rich freighted with the sunshine of the
day.
The jewelled waves run to the coral reef
Bearing the fairy fleet beyond my reach.
Their loveliness is gone, as morning mist
Fades from the hilltops that the sun has
kissed,
Passed like the beauty of an autumn leaf
Far from the golden shimmer of the beach.
The yellow petals of hibiscus float
Upon the water, drifting from above
To rest upon the foam-tipped green and
blue....
Be pitiful, O Sea ! Be gentle, too,
O Sea of Life, with every frail dream-boat
We launch, rich-laden, with our hope and
love.

ETHEL MARTYR.
The Harbor Dreams.
Sending streamers of light afar,
Circling lamps on the shore gleam bright;
Stirless under the star-strewed sky,
What does the harbor dream to-night?
Never a wind awakes its sleep,
Never the cry of a flying swan ;
Is it of days to be it dreams,
Is it of days and nights long gone?
Carven, colored and jewel-bright,
Radiant nights and noons it knew
Back in the past, ere Phillip’s ships
Clove its waters of peerless blue.
While the world with its woes and wars
Strove and sorrowed, in peace it slept;
Silence older than measured time
Watch and ward on its beauty kept.
While in glory ’neath northern stars
Banners fluttered and armies tramped,
Blind to beauty along its shores
Wild-eyed men by their dim fires camped.
Ever and ever it dreamed its dream,
Hushed, unhearing the far world’s din;
Bathed in splendor and calm it saw
Phillip’s ships through the heads sail in.
Oh, I think when their sea-worn hulls
Dropped their anchors, and lay at rest,
Splendid visions of future fame
Sent a thrill through its heaving breast;
While drums sounded and bugles called,
Breaking the sleep of its lustrous bays,
Forward looking through years and years,
Ships it saw of the whaling cays ;
Bluff-browed ships on its bosom lay,
Tired of winds and of wastes forlorn,
Manned by mariners tough and brave,
Brown and rugged and weatherworn.
Then, when whaler and whaling men
Sailed away from its shining bays,
Forward looking through years and years.
Ships it saw of the clipper days.
Ripples rose at the sight of them,
Rose and raced to their gilded sides;
Stately brides of the sea were they,
Ships beloved of the winds and tides.
Passed the clippers ; yet still a-dream,
Dreaming ever of future fame,
Forward looking through years and years,
Iron ships through its portals came ;
Lights of green at their starboard side,
Lights of ruby agleam at port,
Mammoth ships from the sea came in,
Tramp and liner, to pay it court.
So a-shimmer with streaming lights,
Stirless, sleeping in cove and bay,.
Thus it dreamt, but what further sight
Shines before it no man might say.
While the tide on its mission moved
Under planets and stars that gleamed,
Pale and lone as its circling light,
Thus I dreamed that the harbor dreamed.

RIGHTEOUS BUTTRESSES OF EVIL.
“I have travelled and investigated all over the
country, and I now unhesitatingly affirm that the
enforcement of our laws has reached a shocking state
of laxity. In every town they are broken openly
and flagrantljr. In the city matters are, if possible,
worse.” — Albert Lane, M.L.A., to N. S. Wales
Christian Endeavor Union Convention.
Mr. Lane might have gone further and pro-
tested not merely against the laws and cus-
toms which are broken, but against many
of those which exist. Some of the rotten-
est have an intimate relation to what should
bo the business of Christianity. Those which
control our public hospitals, for example.
The State says, over most of the Common-
wealth, that the public must directly contri-
bute half the upkeep of the hospitals, and
the churches for the most part agree that
this arrangement is beneficial to the citi-
zens’ souls. From the standpoint of the
indigent sick, who are the traditional charge
of the churches, the system is bad; viewed
from other points it is worse. In N. S.
Wales last year the hospitals drew £458,81S
in Government grants, £132,230 in patients’
payments and only £355,870 from subscrip-
tions and from the frequent charity “drives,”
big and little, which are a feature of the
community’s social life. It is impossible to
estimate with anything like accuracy the
huge sums frittered away on hospital balls,
hospital concerts, hospital cabarets and the
rest, but the total must be enormous. A
recent hilarious function, where things were
done on an unusually lavish scale, produced
£42 for the cause; and it is not uncommon
for these shows to make a loss. Small won-
der that in most of the States the hospitals
are chronically hard up, if not insolvent, and
that as often as an epidemic arrives sufferers
have to be turned away! The exception is
Queensland, where, in the words of a recent
issue of the Medical Journal of Aus-
tralia, “an examination of the accounts of
most of the smaller hospitals shows that,
even when prices have been at the highest
for years, the hospitals have been able to
carry 0n.... This has, however, been due
primarily to the receipts from the Golden
Casket Art Union, which has been an im-
portant factor in the finance of the hospitals
of Queensland for the past two years.”
* * * •
There are two problems which every honest
Christian should consider in a detached
spirit:—
(1) Is it not better that a certain amount of
gambling should be frankly condoned than that
people suffering from curable troubles should be
permitted to die ?
(2) If any gambling is to be condoned, should
not the choice lie with the more innocuous forms of
it?
In N. S. Wales recently, an unchallengeable
authority having proclaimed “the definite
failure of the voluntary system of hospital
maintenance,” there was talk of saving the
situation by means of a State lottery. A
State lottery is, no doubt, an undesirable
expedient, not to say a measure of despera-
tion, just as the Queensland Golden Casket
is; but the perniciousness of such institu-
tions is relative. By comparison with
modern horse-racing they are things of
virtue. Yet the moment the State-lottery pro-
ject was mooted organised Christianity be-
gan an attack on it which presently resulted
in its death. A well-advertised sermon
preached in Wollongong on “That National
Scandal, the Proposed State Lottery,” was
characteristic of hundreds delivered before
and since—discourses chockful of construc-
tive plans for defeating petty gambles, such
as lotteries, which do little moral or econo-
mic harm, but containing no clear demand
for the abolition, or even the limitation, of
racing, which probably does more damage
to the home life of the Australian working
classes than anything else. It is agreed by
sociologists the world over, and it is not
seriously questioned by the most Savona-
ROLA-like priests and parsons, that mankind
will have a certain amount of gambling. It
can no more be totally prohibited than flirt-
ing. The need could be met in perhaps 90
per cent, of cases by a regulated gamble—
one which would limit the speculator to the
purchase of a ss. ticket, or a series of them
—and the whole of the profits might be allo-
cated to the hospitals. The State, as has
been already remarked, condones gamb-
ling on racecourses, and the churches, to the
extent that none of them embarks on an organ-
ised campaign to lessen, much less abolish,
it, are equally guilty. Racecourse gambling
is not a once-a-week or once-a-month affair,
like a lottery or art-union gamble: it can be
indulged in every day of the year in this
country bar Sundays. No one but a lunatic
dreams of “plunging” on a lottery: every
second punter imagines from time to time that
lie has unearthed a stable secret which is
going to spell fortune for himself and disas-
ter for the Ring. In practice the Ring
almost invariably takes the cash and he “the
knock,” but that does not deter myriads of
others from playing up their money and the
money of their employers on similar lines.
Said Attorney-General Bavin during the
debate on his proposed Crimes Act amend-
ments last week: —
It was impossible to assign to one cause the in-
crease in crime; but in view of the class of crime
he thought it could safely be said that a very large
percentage of crime and dishonesty was directly
traceable to gambling.
Since the law gives a virtual monopoly of
the gambling trade to certain racecourses, he
would have been within the mark in saying
that the increase of crime is due to racing;
an institution which is honored by the
highest in the land, and which —a matter
of cause and effect, maybe—goes practically
unassailed by the Christian churches.
* * * *
The incoming chairman of the Congrega-
tional Union of N. S. Wales began his re-
cent address with a striking truth :
An analysis of modern life revealed many weak-
nesses, one of the most serious and the fruitful
occasion of others being its lack of reality. For the
great mass of people the surface things had set up
a state of hypnosis, in which life was taken as it
came, and there was little, if any, reflection.
We see this state of hypnosis employed by
the forces of evil to their own profit in other
directions than at race meetings where, under
the patronage of the nation’s most promi-
nent churchmen, Protestant and R.C., quasi-
criminals are licensed to prey on criminals
in embryo. There is a tremendous vote,
emblematic of righteousness, for prohibition ;
a much smaller one for liquor reform. No
citizen who permits himself to reflect, and
who is willing to face the realities, can be-
lieve that, if prohibition were carried in an
Australian State to-morrow, the results
would be anything but disastrous. The mass
of the people are immeasurably less ready
for it than those of say, Maine (U.S.A.),
which, after three-quarters of a century
of the experiment, is still sufficiently un-
regenerate to be the stronghold of the Ameri-
can rum-running trade. No Australian
State has the means of enforcing such a
policy; and, indeed, the task would be suffi-
ciently hopeless if it were undertaken by
the Commonwealth. On the other hand, a
tremendous amount of practical good is to
be achieved by liquor reform —by a steady
effort to raise the standard of the hotels
and of the drink they supply. The same un-
thinking Puritans who do excellent work
for the most devastating form of gamble
that was ever invented are likewise the best
friends of the most ruinous class of booze-
vendor. Organised Christianity could deal
v.d. —which, with gambling and drink, has
been classed as Australia’s chief curse—a
deadly blow by the simple process of agree-
ing unitedly to tackle it free of that “state
of hypnosis” which causes it to appear a
subject for silence and inaction in righteous
circles. But, like gambling and drink, it is
a problem which requires to be approached
with an eye to the realities, and to the im-
mediate needs of the situation. The error
under which so many good churchmen labor
is that because certain crimes are fashion-
able —law-breaking of the sort witnessed by
Lane, M.L.A., the Randwick Ring, the
mean pub with its stock of liquid murder,
and so on—it is not their business to head
a crusade against them. It will be a dark
day for the retailers of ruin when their natu-
ral enemies cease bleating complaints that
do not hurt in the least, and become active
on practical lines. Meanwhile Catastrophe
will continue to prosper while Christianity
remains atrophied.
UNCLE’S “STRANGLEHOLD.”
On the Americanisation of Australians: —
There are constant additions to the overwhelming
volume of evidence that American domination of the
cinema theatre is a bad thing for Australians who
are growing up. Sometimes the illustration is fur-
nished by an unfortunate urchin who leaps from the
brow of a lofty cliff, “the way they do it at the
pictures,” or points a revolver at his forehead and
pulls the trigger. Sometimes the public reads that
a youthful devotee of the silent drama, fired by the
example of the Hooded Yegg, or -of Zapata, the Hold-
up King, has embarked on a thrilling career of bur-
glary. Or a representative man like Frank Tate,
Victorian Director of Education, warns the Imperial
Education Conference in London that “British habits
of life and ways of expressing thought and emotion
are being insidiously affected by films produced
in America” —films objectionable on the score of
“vulgarisms in speech,” and, above all, of “a
certain over-emotionalism of treatment and a lack
of the reticence and reserve associated with good
manners.” Or an organisation like the Sydney
Rescue Work Society plaintively announces that,
owing partly to “the frequent exhibition of films
dealing with sex questions, which tend to give young
people entirely false views of life, and to lead them
to ldok lightly on moral lapses,” its labors have
been increased.
# # # o
Some American screen-plays are saturated with a
sloppy morality. Others implant a distaste for honest
work and matrimony in the minds of feather-headed
young females, encouraging them to imagine that,
like Messalina Podesta in “Souls for Sale” and
Claribel Cokayne in “Aromatic Passion,” they
wer e born to lead the lives of social butterflies,
loafing on and receiving the lingering embraces of
some superlatively handsome lover, color no object.
As to that, a Sydney business-girl, described as “of
prepossessing appearance,” sued a Japanese recently
for breach of promise of marriage. In the box she
stated that she had surrendered to his blandishments,
that there was an infant, and that the co-author, in-
stead of legitimising it, as he undertook to do, had
transferred his affections to another white girl. All
this might conceivably have happened had the cine-
matograph never been invented. But there is no
getting away from the unpleasant fact that Austra-
lian girls have become familiar in the picture-
theatre with the spectacle of at least one Japanese
screen-actor resident in America, and of mimes got
up as Africans, making love to white women and
being glorified in the process. There is no weightier
cc'unt in the indictment against American screen-
“art” than that it has clothed miscegenation with a
false glamor of romance—-and this in a country
where preservation of race-purity is the all-in-all.
*■*•**
When in Queensland half-Priminister Page was
interviewed by the Brisbane Diggers who have honor-
ably distinguished themselves in the campaign for
more Australian pictures and less American rubbish.
After listening to an exposition of their fifty-fifty
proposal—a film to be turned out locally for every
one allowed through the Customs —he “promised to
go carefully into the matter with Mr. Austin Chap-
man when the Tariff Board is ready with its report.”
Much depends on that document, but little is hoped
from a Board which has caused it to be announced
that it shrinks from protecting the Australian
picture-maker, either by imposing substantial duties
on foreign stuff (now admitted at rates which
amount to an insolent fraud on the taxpayer) or
by prohibiting imports beyond a specified footage
per annum. The Board is afraid that the latter
proceeding would “offend America.” It wouldn’t
offend any American whose feelings are worth con-
sidering. That type of American is the most savage
critic of his country’s villainous photo-plays, of
the imbecile journalism (slavishly imitated* in Sydney
papers) which has grown up about them, and of
the beastly orgies and crimes which have made
Hollywood infamous. The classic satire on the
American silent drama has been written by Harry
Leon Wilson, who recently visited Australia. In
his novel, “Merton of the Movies,” he shows that
the alleged “art” of the screen is all artifice and
bamboozle, and that the pictures are made by a
parcel of absurd fakers and “beautiful morons” for
a public composed in the main of noodles and
barbarians. The best class of U.S. citizens will take
no exception to measures calculated to discourage the
importation of Hollywood offal and to foster the
production of pictures which will make some appeal
to intelligence and healthy Australian sentiment.
* * * *
Anyhow, what has Americani opinion to do with
Australian policy? If Australian interests demand
an embargo on American films, the thing should be
done, whether it will “offend America” or not.
America is never deterred from rejecting consign-
ments of Australian goods or expelling Australian
citizens by fears of offending Australia. The last
steamer from the U.S.A. brought three Australians
who had been refused admission to Gaud’s own
country, and imprisoned for weeks in an immigration
depfit, because they had “exceeded the quota,” the
quota, in Australia’s case, being 279 per year. By
the same boat came the representative of an Ameri-
can movie co., whose business here is to swell its
undertaxed profits on films allowed in at a tithe of
their real value, and dutiable on that tithe, or less.
Obviously the gentleman should have been told that
Australia had no use for him, the quota of American
movie agents having been exceeded long ago. In
place of that he was allowed to land and to hold
forth in one of the newspapers on the impossibility
of developing an Australian picture industry. There
is no impossibility about it, as he knows perfectly
well. By extending the national fiscal policy to
cinematograph films, Australia could develop a very
successful picture industry; it has all the other
requisites, notably a first-class climate and a first-
class market. As to the market, the British Trade
Commissioner noted in his last annual report that
the Australian public had paid £3,574,740 in one
year for admission to cinema theatres. He added
that “an appreciable sectionl of the public is tired
of American films, and genuinely desires to see high-
class British and Australian productions,’' but the
desire has not been gratified because “American film
interests have a stranglehold” on the business. In
consequence • of this stranglehold “Australian film
production is almost at a standstill, although Aus-
tralian scenery and episodes of Australian life lend
themselves to artistic and interesting treatment.”
A contributory cause of the stranglehold is the fiscal
folly of Australian Governments, which allow copies
of American screen-plays, struck off in the country
of origin for a few hundred dollars (this can be
done although the original may have cost a million
dollars, as the press-agent asserts), to come in at
lid. per foot. The result is that the Australian who
spends £4OOO or £5OOO on a “feature” has to com-
pete, with agents who can land any number of Yankee
films, in a form ready for exhibition, for £lOO
apiece at the outside. When this abominable
swindle is stopped, by means of ad valorem duties,
an embargo on the fifty-fifty principle, or both, Aus-
tralian producers will make pictures, and good ones,
too. And the profits will remain in Australia for
the nourishment of Australian industry, instead of
streaming across the Pacific into the pockets of
foreigners, who don’t care a dump for the Common-
wealth, and who, judging by their poisonous pro-
ductions, are of a low order of intellect and
morals, and are often venomously anti-British into
the bargain.
THE UNHOLY CITY.
In a house opposite mine a person of the
female persuasion is attacking “The Holy
City” with energy worthy of better results.
Another, a door or two away, is liable to do
the same at any day or hour or moment.
There is no adequate precaution to meet the
case.
How the place became holy is a mystery,
yet it seems to be little use to argue against
it. If one wanders through the voluminous
but not very illuminating pages of “Hymns
Aged and Moderate” he finds everywhere
the expression of a pious yearning to get to
old Jerusalem in this life, though very few
people go and more wish they hadn’t; also
a crave to find a new and permanent Jerusa-
lem after death. It seems no great repay-
ment for the trouble and expense of dying.
Pious prose literature of the cheaper sort
reeks of Jerusalem, and it is- mentioned at
least twice in every impromptu Methodist
and Salvationist supplication.
The city was built in the days of ’way
back by idolaters. Nothing particularly good
is mentioned concerning its early life or its
early aspirations after better things, and
barring one or two casual references, one
with a dead body in it, the place drifts into
the Scripture rather late. It remained
foreign, alien and idolatrous for 300 or 400
years after the Hebrew had begun to impose
liis crude and violent form of piety on the
rest of Palestine. Then it was added to the
kingdom, and started on its way to be Zion
and the Holy City, by one of the worst
characters in Holy Writ— Joab, the eldest of
David’s Three Bad Nephews, who were also
among the principal sources of Uncle’s great-
ness. No nephews ever waded in blood and
bowels and shame to uncle’s throne more
valiantly or more whole-heartedly. They
may not actually have helped him with his
Psalms, but otherwise the Three Musketeers
were men of many uses, and for more than
40 stormy years they, or the survivor of
them, kept their royal master in fear of los-
ing his soul at any moment.
The musical female is still going for all
she is worth.
The record suggests that many bad things
and few good ones were done in the Holy
City. The first and greatest monarch mar-
ried there off and on, and had several more
families there. One of the wives was
married already, but the eldest and most reli-
able of the Three Musketeers put her hus-
band out of the way by arrangement. The
second monarch married probably the largest
aggregate wife on record there, and became
a fratricide and a brisk and promising idola-
ter at the same address. Twenty subsequent
sovereigns kept the flag afloat with diminish-
ing glory. They became worse as they
shambled on, till six out of the last seven
aren’t credited with a redeeming feature
among them. Then Jerusalem I. was wiped
out by divine order as too unholy to be toler-
ated, while mildly respectable places like
Babylon and Tyre and Damascus went on
their prosperous way for centuries. Indeed,
Damascus booms to this day, so far as a
Mohammedan town is likely to boom.
Jerusalem 11. led a precarious existence
for a shade over 500 years, mostly under
foreign domination. It owed what beauty
and dignity it possessed mostly to Herod, a
foreign gentleman of 10 wives and a thou-
sand murders, who adorned it greatly not
very long before its second fall, so that, like
many other females with a past, it died
painted. A great faller was Jerusalem, the
same as Delhi, but it lacked Delhi’s wonder-
ful rising capacity, and its habit of becoming
the capital of a new empire when the old
one was used up or blown out. The second
fall of the Holy City, like the first one, has
been ascribed to extra-special unholiness, and
it was a mad, wild spectacle of promiscuous,
unorganised fighting, with civil war inside
and every other sample of war outside. It
was not only that brother slew brother in
the streets and alleys. He also slew grandpa,
and wasn’t very particular what became of
mother-in-law. That was the end of Jerusa-
lem 11. Sixty years later, a heathen, for no
very visible reason, made a beginning of
wliat is now Jerusalem 111. and worshipped
Jupiter there.
The unmusical female across the street be-
gins to flag in her efforts, and to flop by the
wayside. *
The Holy City is held in high esteem by
Jews, Christians and Mohammedans. But
Judaism wasn’t born there, and, in fact, it
was quite an old institution when David
moved the portable Ark to his new head-
quarters, and danced before it with no
drapery on his hindquarters, to the great
scandal of his first wife. Christianity, in
its pure, original form, had its origin in
Galilee. The second or inferior or theologi-
cal edition, devised by Paul the Hair-
splitter, which prevails (though with many
variations) to this day, dates from the
heathen city of Antioch. Mohammedanism
was a faith which just happened along with
its bag as any other traveller might do. Odd
sects and casual bigotries and superstitions
might originate in the Holy City, but not
kona fide religions. It was always out of
luck. The Redeemer was not born there,
nor were His parents. Not one of the
Apostles was born there. The only real
apostle whose home was reputed to be in the
province to which Jerusalem belonged was
Judas Iscariot (Judaii of Kerioth). Of
the five apostles whose trade is on record
four were fishermen, and no one fishes at
the Holy City except for travellers. There
is no definite reason to believe that Christ
ever slept a night in the .Tebusite town of ill
omen. The Condemnation took place there,
which is nothing to the old spot’s credit, but
the marvels of the Resurrection and the
Ascension took place elsewhere. The latter
took place in two localities elsewhere, and
both localities are shown to the unsuspecting
visitor. Jerusalem was the scene of few
miracles. The atmosphere was not congenial.
It is an unprogressive little town, which
was cleaned by Herod, and again, after an.


interval bv General Allenby, and possibly
in between'. It is one of the few cities which
stand neither on a river, lake nor harbor, but
it "is perched on a shocking kind of rock,
and was a good fortress in bow-and-arrow
times, and even in subsequent or catapult
days.’ The little Jebusite State seems to
have’ consisted chiefly of a hill and a -hole,
and it was natural to build on the hill, in
order to keep an eye lifting for Hebrew
adventurers approaching with Arks.
The female opposite has providentially left
off. Possibly she is dead, but that seems too
much to hope for.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
“The Indomitable Spirit of Anzae.”
The fact that two United States land syn-
dicates have been nosing around N. S. Wales
with offers to do business has filled Premier
Fuller with optimism, and the way that
one-time economist has been going on of late
has been dreadful to behold. All the States
have got the loan-immigration-land-settlement
craze badly, and as the Commonwealth,
which is the same lot of people over again,
has got it also, everybody has got it twice.
That is to say, the Commonwealth has gone
mad about buying population except for its
own estate in the N. Territory, and is agi-
tated about everybody’s business barring its
own exclusive business. Fuller’s situation
is not exactly that, he wants a loan boom,
which would look superfluous, as the biggest
loan boom Australia ever dreamt of is going
full speed now, but he wants to pile another
one on top of it, and gaily put a skyscraper
on the leaning tower of Pisa. It was at a
club luncheon that he recently made his
really strenuous effort, and this was a part
of it:—
In the past our progress and development have
been trifled with, and the people’s conception of
what a magnificent young country like ours really
requires has been dwarfed accordingly. The Govern-
ment would be justified in spending considerably
more than was proposed in introducing the 0000
immigrants, particularly as practically the whole of
the money would be returned to the State. It was
something of a reproach that their American friends
seemed to have greater faith in the resources of the
State than many of the people had. A few months
ago an American wanted to secure large tracts of
Crown land, and now a syndicate apparently was
ready to put a huge sum of money on another scheme.
Yet when the State Government proposed a big
national development scheme on safe, sound lines,
the very bigness of the idea seemed to frighten some
people. But surely the indomitable spirit of Anzae
would not forsake Australians in the less hazardous
tasks of peace-time development.
So G. Fuller wants the Ma State, which
only pawned Posterity last year for ten or
a dozen millions, to get a move on, and have
a real bender, At a first reading there is
something fine and bluff in this shout that
we should have confidence in our country and
go ahead, and it almost sounds like some-
thing Danton might have spoken with
frenzy in his eye and his shirt-collar flying
in the wind. On a second view it seems
more like an appeal to have confidence in the
infant, and, with an indomitable Anzac spirit,
to shove him into the front of the battle.
The Fuller Government proposed to intro-
duce 6000 immigrants at a cost of £9,000,000
in loans, and leave the bill to baby. Through
stupidity or laziness or ignorance or some-
thing, it is now alleged that the cost will be
£19,000,000; but politicians with a “concep-
tion of what a magnificent young country
like ours really requires” are not daunted
thereby, and say bravely that, so long as they
have the handling and spending of the
money, it doesn’t really matter how much
baby is let in for. Their confidence in them-
selves and their own Anzac spirit is so
humble that a member of the Fuller Cabi-
net has declared that it is impossible to pay
for primary schools out of revenue; on the
other hand his confidence in baby is so enor-
mous that he proposed to charge schools to
loans, and let baby pay for his own educa-
tion. There could be only one lower depth,
and that would be for dad to charge his
clothes to loans, and call on Posterity to pay,
on the plea that it was out of consideration
for him, and to avoid bringing discredit on
him, that the old man didn’t go about like
one of the people that make D. R. Hall
blush. The two United States syndicates
which came around here on speculation bent
certainly showed more confidence in N. S.
Wales than the average political Australian,
because they proposed putting their own
money into their ventures, not the next
generation’s money. That lesson seems to
be lost on Fuller and co. One syndicate
also showed much more confidence in the
Ma State’s outports than the local politician
can be induced to do. for it wanted to risk
its capital in the development of Port
Stephens, one of the three fine natural ports
which the Fullers keep in an inaccessible
condition in the imaginary interests of Syd-
ney. But though these strangers beat
Fuller and co. hollow on two points, neither
of them, so far as is known, proposed to
bring in raw and impecunious settlers whole-
sale at some £3OOO each. The Fuller Gov-
ernment’s plea is that totals don’t really
matter because the amounts are to be “re-
turned to the State” —are recoverable, in
fact. And it is equally true that all advances
are recoverable, provided they can be re-
covered.. For instance, Russian bonds and the
money invested in the State trawlers which
Geo. Fuller fathered.
Poincare and His Critics.
When a Papuan pioneer returns to Aus-
tralia, after half a lifetime spent in the
study of the inhabitants and their ways, it
is not often that a newspaper is discovered
with sufficient effrontery to lay down tin'
law to the veteran on the best methods of
dealing with Papuan natives. It is recog-
nised that, even where the wanderer is of
unusually poor mentality, his special know-
ledge puts him in a strong position. There
is a type of newspaper in Australia which
makes no such concession to the Prime Min-
ister of France. And yet he has quite as
much special knowledge of Germans as any
Australian has ever had of Papuans. Poin-
care is now 63. Besides being an eminent
writer and a member of the Academy, he is
I ranee’s leading commercial lawyer. 'Clearly
hi is not an easy man to deceive. Thirty
years ago, when he first held Ministerial
office, he began studying Germany and the
psychology of the Germans. His investiga-
tions satisfied him that there would be no
peace for Europe or the world till the Ger-
man States, and particularly Saxony,
Bavaria and Prussia, were separated to the
extent of having different tariff, coinage,
legal and postal systems, as well as distinct
armies, police forces, etc. If France was
not able to disintegrate Germany, he argued,
Germany would do that or worse to France.
He was right to the extent that the Ger-
mans tried ; their avowed intention, until the
entry of the U.S. into the war, was to oblit-
erate France. When the peace arrived Poin-
care was disclosed as almost the only states-
man with a policy. While political matinee
idols of the Lloyd George type were leap-
ing eloquently from a scheme for “going
through the Hun’s pockets for the last mark”
to one of “giving our late foes a chance to
rise again, as Britons always did,” Poin-
care pursued a set course. He had said
little while the fighting was in progress: he
has said little since it ended. But he has
always said the same thing—that the Ger-
mans understood neither repentance nor
peace, and that it would be suicidal of the
French to ignore the fact. He prophesied
that the Germans would default in their re-
parations payment, and they did. He pro-
phesied how it would be done—by Govern-
ment refusals to impose taxes or to charge
payable freights and fares on the State trans-
port systems, and by private-enterprise in-
vestments abroad —and he was right. He
threatened after last year’s short coal deli-
veries to occupy the Ruhr, and after the
default at the end of January he did so. He
was assured by writers of the English “Man-
chester School” that he had blundered; that
the ruing bleiben of the Ruhr workers would
beat him. The passive resistance of the in-
habitants of the Ruhr valley collapsed in
the briefest possible time, as Poincare had
said it would. He still believes that Ger-
many could be organised into solvency by
her capitalists—though admittedly the task
is now tremendous—but that the will to pay
is lacking; and he considers that with bank-
ruptcy the confederation must dissolve.
There is no doubt this will benefit France:
it should mean security for a century. But
Poincare also affirms that the Germans will
work as diligently and well for the common
commercial good of Europe in a disintegrated
condition as ever they did while members of
a predatory empire. And here, too, he has
sound claims to be taken seriously.

More Whitewash Imminent.
R. E. O’Halloran, one of the Eastern
Suburbs M’s.L.A. in the N. S. Wales Assem-
bly, has moved for “the appointment of a
select committee to inquire into and report
upon the conduct and administration of pony-
racing in this State.” J. G. Arkins (St.
George) observed pertinently:—
It is rather strange—l do not know how it
occurs — but Mr. O’Hallohan, who is one of *he
members for the Eastern Suburbs, which is the
hub of racing in N. S. Wales, has moved for the
appointment of this committee, which includes
amongst its members Mr. Oakf.s, Mr. Goldstein
and Mr. Jaques, all of whom represent the Eastern
Suburbs. These gentlemen live in the locality which
is the centre of racing—the locality where the
fraternity that controls racing, namely, the book-
makers, reside.
Just as a man is rarely the best judge of
his own case, so a politician is rarely a
good judge of the case of an influential con-
stituent. much less a colony of them. H. V.
Jaques, who is one of the committeemen
charged with the duty of taking a judicial
view of what has been termed “a cancer in
the body of the working-class,” immediately
disclosed that pony-racing has an admirer
in him :
The Associated Racing Clubs are at the present
time conducted very, very well indeed. To-day we
read in the newspapers that they are going to add
5000 sovereigns per year in prize money to each of
four meetings under their control, a thing which
has never been done before in the history of racing
in the world.
What can be expected, in such circum-
stances, but a hearty testimonial to the
goodness of character and purity of motives
of the racing bosses? In any event the job
is a difficult one. It calls, first, for an admis-
sion of the undesirability of certain prac-
tices. Now. some of the most unmitigated
ruffians on the turf are in an unassailable
position by reason of the fact that their
doings are accepted in the best circles as
legitimate. If a private citizen ran a
gambling establishment —whether for the
purposes of roulette or baccarat at high
stakes, or two-up on the lowest scale —it
would be enough, from the standpoint of the
police, for witnesses to testify that they,
had patronised the place. There would be
a raid, heavy fines, and all the rest of it.
But the private individuals who make huge
incomes out of the gambling that goes on
at the pony meetings are immune from the
moral reproaches, as well as from the mone-
tary penalties, which attach to professional
gamblers elsewhere. Those who consider
that pony-racing should either be put on a
non-proprietary basis and drastically con-
trolled as to gambling potentialities, or
wiped out altogether as a public menace
and nuisance, might bring a whole army of
ruined toilers in support of their claims,
only to be met with the argument: “What
have these unfortunate persons to do with
us? It is legal to bet at pony meetings.
Unless they have been swindled in some
way, and can prove it, they have no griev-
ance to which we can listen.” In point of
fact, most of the swindles, or near-swindles,
that characterise the racing business have
been legitimised by the benign hand of tra-
dition. What Parliamentary committee, for
example, would dream of examining a wit-
ness who had been required to pay racing-
owners a proportion of his sweep money—
presumably to run their animals straight?
Even the A.J.C. committee accepts this as
honorable business on the part of a racing
stable. The Parliamentary committee which
is to report on the pony-racing scandal may
hear a number of antagonistic stories and
rumors, and it can also rely on hearing
plenty of adulation. But. bias apart,
there is little, if any, hope of its being able
to hand Parliament a useful set of conclu-
sions, for the very good reason that nearly
all the accepted premises assume actions to
be creditable on a racecourse which, off
it, would be considered dishonorable and
detrimental to the happiness of individuals
and the prosperity of the State.
Russia ant! the Wheat Market.
The literary W. M. Hughes, who is under-
stood to speak also for the political W. M.
Hughes, grew bitterly angry the other day
over the matter of a syndicate of British
and Russian capitalists, which is putting
up £1,000,000 to promote the purchase and
marketing of Russian wheat. “The same
amount of money invested in a scheme for
developing Australian wheat-growing would,”
he said, “give much better results.” Enlarg-
ing on this text he proceeded to draw a pic-
ture of Australia’s future :
There is no other way by which Empire migra-
tion can be carried out successfully than on the
basis of land settlement, and as, apart from cotton
—which promises great things, but is, as yet, only
in its infancy, and which, in any case, will be largely
cdnfined to comparatively limited belts of our
country—this can only be effected by increasing
the area under wheat, it follows that upon the devel-
opment of wheat-growing depends the rapid peopling
of this country. There is room for tens of thou-
sands more wheat farmers, for Australia is potenti-
ally one of the world’s greatest granaries. Every
acre in areas with a sufficient rainfall, now devoted
to sheep, put under wheat increases its productivity
and value many times. Money invested in Australia
for this purpose is a gilt-edged security.
If the future of Australia depends on this
vegetable the outlook is very gloomy. One
trouble is that, despite the most intensive
borrowing with a view to settlement—mostly
wheat settlement—there is less land under
wheat than there was a good many years
ago, when the debt was not much more than
half its present size. The petted vegetable
tapers off almost to nothing at the Queens-
land border, less than one-third of the way
up the map, and so far as N. S. Wales is
concerned it begins to taper very consider-
ably north of a line draw from about Trial
Bay inland. Possibly the conditions fail
to some extent. A handy book of reference
alleges:—■
The ideal conditions are a long and rather wet
winter, a cool and rather wet spring, and a warm
to hot summer, with little rain, especially in the
ripening period.
And that doesn’t sound much like Australia.
Last year the N.S.W. railways sacrificed over
£1,200,000 in carrying grain, flour, hay,
straw and chaff below cost —at least, they
were carried for that amount less than the
average charge, and the average charge,
judging by the balance-sheet, about repre-
sented cost. Wool, a product which the ex-
Prime Minister, with his ignorance of sugar
and sheep and ships and natural products in
general, would root up to make room for
more wheat, on the other hand yielded the
Ma State railways £290,000 over the cost of
carriage. It is a sturdy, solvent product, so
the Department charged it £1 Bs. 7d. for
the same haulage for which it only dared
charge wheat ss. 6d. lest the anaemic plant
should die. With the additional aid of a
Government guarantee, and lavish loan ex-
penditure to settle new growers as the old
ones fled, the wheat industry pretty well
held its own last year. But it has few
prospects, except for local supply, by reason
of long land distances, absurdly long sea
distances, the necessity for carriage by other
people’s ships, high wages, the mortgaged
state of the new settlers, the lack of that
“long and rather wet winter,” etc., the abun-
dance of rabbits, and other causes. If Rus-
sia, once the greatest supplier in the world,
but lately a famine-stricken beggar, is com-
ing back, then the loan cranks who talk of
Australian dependence on wheat exports had
better give up the ghost. But there is a
man’s job waiting for Australia, and it is
expressed in these figures:—
Two Months’ Trade Returns.
Imports (mostly manufactured goods) £23,663,564
Exports (supposed to pay for same) . . 10,282,250
Deficit (value of urgent job waiting) £13,381,314
Allowing that some of these goods can’t be
produced, or substitutes found, in this coun-
try, the figures should still represent
£70,000,000 per annum of work to be done
here, for reliable customers here. Australia
doesn’t want to import wheat-growers, or to
kill its wool industry (almost the only sol-
vent primary industry of the lot at the
moment), or to worry whether foreign Bol-
sheviks are back in the grain trade or not.
It wants to stop foreign loans, which find
their way here in the shape of foreign goods
to the harm of our industries; to bring in
artisans; to put six extra storeys on the
tariff, and to build new factories and new
industrial towns like the very deuce.
Side-lights on Prohibition.
S. Talbot Smith writes :—
Some months ago l reviewed “Rackhouse,” a
new novel by George Agnew Chamberlain. It
called the bootlegging business “an industry whose
phenomenal rise makes the miracle of moving pic-
tures as a fortune-mill look slow and conservative
by comparison.” But the hero, who took part m
it, found that he had to fight for his trade, and
even for his life, at every turn. “We don’t dare
send out a truck without an armed guard, with
four gunmen, and someone on top of them that we
can trust.” And still they Were held up on quiet
roads (which were naturally the sort they had to
take, with their illegal goods) and robbed of the
lot. I called this a readable romance “incredible
to Australians if even one-fourth of it were true
or possible.”
And now I find this in the American Legion
Weekly, which is a U.S. journal of repute: —
Death—sure, swift and violent —hovers over every
big booze deal made in the under-world to-day.
The rum barons are trembling. The death-rate among
them is mounting to amazing heights. Frantically
they are looking for a way out. They have hired
gunmen to protect them and the contraband in
which they deal —only to find that these gunmen
give aid and information to the enemy. They can-
not appeal to the forces of law and order, for they
realise that booze bas no rights, and that the Courts
have little sympathy for a cheater who has been
cheated by a cheater. They are between two fires,
and must resort to the only law the underworld
knows —gun 1aw....
Prohibition-enforcement officers estimate that the
hijackers get more than a million dollars a month
from the bootleggers. Yet there is never a howi
of protest from the victims. Many turn hijackers,
engage their own gunmen, and retrieve their losses,
while many hire more gunmen and attempt to fight
off the wolves. The bootleggers live in terror of
the hijackers, and the hijackers in terror of each
other. It is off the coasts of the U.S. that the big
money is handled by bootleggers and rum-carriers.
And it is the sea that receives the human toll which
they pay for the hazardous work they do. The
steamer John Dwight was sunk last April off the
Massachusetts coast. Subsequently eight bodies were
washed ashore. She was loaded with bottled ale.
Pirates, they say, murdered the crew, scuttled the
vessel, and escaped with 90,000 dollars known to
have been aboard. They got away with approxi-
mately 200.000 when they boarded the schooner
Patricia Behinan, kidnapped or murdered the cap-
tain and crew, and abandoned the ship off Long
Island. When she was picked up the decks had
been splintered by machine-gun and rifle bullets,
and were littered with empty shells.
Never in the history of seaport cities have so
many floaters —dead men—been picked up in a
period of 12 months as have been reported by
coroners to April 1, 1923. The sea is daily giving
up the remains of bootleggers and hijackers who
have sacrificed their lives in the struggle for gold.
Hardly a week passes that the coastguards do not
pick up a drifting craft with one or more dead
men, riddled with bullets, in the cabin or on the
deck.
The public conscience of the U.S. wasn’t ready for
the Volstead amendment when it arrived, and it
is plain that the position is no better to-day, if
indeed it isn’t worse. America, which always does
things on the grand scale, has provided the world
with its biggest example of an unenforceable law
making a desperate effort to function, and naturally
the outcome has been the biggest instalment of
anarchy the republic has known. Since, in accord-
ance with a simple economic law, bootlegging
must continue until the inhabitants of America do
what no other white race has done yet— i.e., achieve
a distaste for alcohol —the “hijackers” will also pre-
sumably remain in action, with the enforcement
officers impartially pumping lead into both armies.
A colossal price in human lives and civic moral
for a doubtful experiment.
Words of Comfort.
Bruxner, M.L.A., who leads the Separa-
tion movement in N.S.W. Assembly, is con-
fident of success, though when he explains
his confidence he isn't particularly convincing.
This was part of a recent utterance: —
There is no constitutional difficulty in the way of
forming new States. People who say so are talking
moonshine.... Adequate provision, has been made in
the Commonwealth Constitution Act for creating new
States. ... In the history of the British Empire
self-government has been refused on one occasion
only and we lost a. continent by that refusal. I refer,
of course, to America. The Britisher wants to man-
age his own affairs. This movement must come to
fruition. It is only a matter of time.
It might be called an unfortunate collec-
tion of remarks. To start with, peaceful
New Staters might be well advised not to
drag in the familiar American precedent too
hard. The Thirteen Original States had
self-government. In fact, they had a lot of
self-governments, and the space to put them
on was so small that one of these old entities
blooms to-day with a Governor and two
Houses of Parliament ruling over 1067 sq.
miles. Some of the constitutions began so
early that self-government was almost ahead
of population. The row which arose with
stupid old George 111. and his Cabinet was
about the interpretation of some of the con-
stitutions (or "charters”), and the people in
London started to amend them so as to clear
up doubtful points. Ireland, and not the
handful of American States, was really the
place where self-government was long and
persistently refused ; and Ireland hasn’t been
officially lost even to this day. Next, the
off-handed statement that "adequate provi-
sion has been made in the Commonwealth
Constitution Act for creating new States”
has to be accepted with great caution. In
one sense the “provision,” so far as New
England in N. S. Wales is concerned, is just
what it was 100 years ago so far as New
England in America was* concerned. That
is to say, the power that forbids secession
may change its mind and let its people go
if it likes, but it never likes unless it is licked
hard. In another sense the position in Aus-
tralia is worse. The British Parliament
could grant Separation, and in the end it did,
but the Commonwealth Parliament can't. In
fact, the whole case is a sea dotted with
jagged reefs of complication, of which these
are some:—
The British Government and Parliament have
abjured the right to interfere with self-governing
States in such matters, and bids them make the best,
of their constitutions a.nd get along as they can.
It explained this point td Graham Berry, of Vic-
toria, when he asked the people in London to amend
the very ill-conceived “charter” they had bestowed
on the infant colony. Having lost 13 self-governing
States by doing what a stupid king considered the
good and fatherly thing- by them, J. Bull takes few
risks nowadays.
The Commonwealth can’t create new States, no
matter what the demand or the advisability, but
by a curious inversion of logic it is authorised to
prevent them being formed even if there is no
obstacle in the way, except itself. Clause 124 alleges
that a new State may be formed by taking a bit of
territory from an old one provided the local Parlia-
mentary majority consents, and Clause 123 puts it
that the area of a State may be diminished or
altered (and a new State can’t be carved out of an
old one without both these things happening) pro-
vided a majority in the local Parliament, and a
majority at a local referendum, give their approval.
Then the Commonwealth Parliament may let the new
State in upon equal terms, or it may offer to let
it ip with such a paltry fragment of representation
(Clause 121) that it will wish it hadn’t taken the
trouble, or it may refuse admission altogether, it
looks wildly absurd to picture the Commonwealth
Parliament objecting, but if Riveriiia, New England,
and Central and Noifh Queensland came in as States
on equal terms, the voting power of, say, Tasmania
in the Senate would drop from one-sixth to one-
tenth, wherefore its members might think hard.
No doubt, the difficulties would be scrambled
over in time, supposing the matter of form-
ing a new State got as far as the Parlia-
ment ; still these terms represent part of
Colonel Bruxne®’s “adequate provision.”
They are in addition (o tin l preliminary
struggles with the State Parliament and tin;
Slate referendum, which have hardly started
yet. It is reassuring to have the Colonel’s
guarantee that there is no constitutional diffi-
culty in the way, but for a man with no
difficulty in the way his progress isn’t fast.
The advantage of realising the difficulties is
that it is possible to get up a healthy excite-
ment about them, and healthy excitement is
good for any cause.
The ‘Lights o’ Carpentaria.
“Matelot” on the worries of the bridge : —
For the last three years or so two of the “light
vessels,” built for the Commonwealth Lighthouse Ser-
vice have been moored to the river bank at Bris-
bane, albeit the lettering on each proclaims that it
ought to be in Carpentaria. In the “Light Lists”
published by the Admiralty a “vessel” is shown as
being in position near Proudfoot Shoal, in order to
minimise the dangers that have to be negotiated by
the master of a ship making Thursday Island or
Torres Strait from the westward. But the Ad-
miralty must have given up the establishment of the
light as a hopeless proposition, for on the latest
charts there is no mention of this safeguard to navi-
gation.
The only reason that is advanced for the dila-
toriness is that the expense of towing even one light

vessel is. more than the Department can face. This
might be regarded as a refreshing instance of depart-
mental economy were it not for the fact that several
recent notices to mariners announce that the power
of quite a number of lights on the coast is to be
increased. Doubtless this is a wise provision, but
to the sailorman it seems a pity that the money
required could not have been used for even more
necessary jobs, such as the establishment of the Car-
pentaria vessel. The Lighthouse Service has done
much excellent work in Torres Strait, but
nothing can excuse the non-utilisation of these two
vessels when the job for which they were built,
rightly regarded as essential, is not being done by
anything else. Is it going to take a marine disaster
of appalling magnitude to force the Department to
place these expensive pieces of machinery where they
should be? We have a navy eating its head off, a
Commonwealth fleet mostly lying idle, and yet a
simple little bit of towage like this is being post-
poned indefinitely.
Another matter worth noting is that there is not
a single direction-finding station on the whole
of our island continent. In practically every other
civilised country in the world to which ships may
go, these invaluable aids to safe navigation are scat-
tered around their coasts. By their aid the ship-
master can accurately ascertain his position in thick
or foggy weather. It may be said that such things
are not needed in our sunlit waters. But are fogs
and dirty weather quite unheard of on our southern
coasts ? At the other side of the world the master
of a ship can now take his vessel Tight up the
Channel, rounding the dreaded Ushant with compara-
tive ease and safety, without once seeing any light or
land. Here the master must trust to luck, and his
passengers and crew to Providence.
Labor Looks in at Hobart.
The end of the Lee Government came some-
what unexpectedly last week. It is only, a
month since the reorganised Nationalist
party successfully withstood a vigorous no-
confidence onslaught by the Opposition •
then the House settled down to put through
a Land and Income Taxation Bill, and to
consider the Government's financial pro-
posals. After several protests from the
Farmers and Pastoralists’ Association
(mostly earnest land-tax dodgers), the Leg.
Council tore all but the innocuous clauses
out of the Income Taxation Bill, and told
the Government to reduce expenditure be-
fore daring to suggest further taxation —
especially of land. Premier Lee, while pro-
testing that he had already cut expenditure
to the bone, and had saved no less than
£70,000 last financial year, in the end meekly
accepted the ultimatum of the Lords and
their drastic amendments, despite the Oppo-
sition’s suggestion that In' should put up a
fight for supremacy with the House of Pri-
vilege. Then came the financial proposals;
whereon, for reasons not very clear,
three ultra-Tories — Grant (Denison).
Blyth (Wilmot) and Murdoch (Frank-
lin) —expressed their disapproval of Lee's
finance, and voted with the Opposition.
Counting pairs, the voting was 16 to 13.
Contrary to expectation, Administrator
Nicholls refused Lee a dissolution, a re-
fusal that so offended the Premier that he
publicly protested* and wrote to his Ex. to
say that, under the circumstances, he did
not feel disposed to the usual course of re-
commending his Ex. to send for the leader
of the Opposition. But the Administrator
sent for Lyons just the same, and after
assuring himself that Lyons could com-
mand a majority in the House, handed him
the Premiership. The position is that the
Labor Government (Lyons, Premier, Trea-
surer and Railways; Belton, Lands and
Works; Ogilvie, Attorney-General and Edu-
cation ; Guy, Chief Secretary; and Lawson,
M.L.C., as honorary) takes office on the pro-
mise of “reasonable support” from four
Nationalists and Speaker Evans. “Reason-
able support” is interpreted to mean that the
new Government will be granted three
months’ supply and an adjournment to en-
able it to bring down its financial pro-
gramme. If Labor’s financial proposals suit
the four or five Nationalists who have broken
away from Lee, presumably the “reason-
able support” will he continued. But an
election wall surely come within six months.
The battle at the polls seems likely to be
a scramble for individual seats, much more
personal and sectarian than political, especi-
ally as far as the Nats, are concerned. On
its purely political record the Nat.
party should be annihilated, for it has failed
to keep the State’s finances on an even or
approximately even keel, has increased the
public debt from £14,000,000 to £23,000,000
in seven years, and has displayed neither
seamanship nor courage on the voyage. It
cannot even speak hopefully about a reor-
ganised Ministry of Nationalists or of a
combined Nationalist and Country party
Ministry, for there have been five reconstruc-
tions in seven years, and every possible com-
bination of the parties mentioned has been
tried. Tas. Labor is not in much better
case for a confident appeal to the electors,
for, while its printed policy reads like some-
thing progressive, it has its full share of
time-servers and trimmers, and there is prac-
tically no political organisation of working-
class voters outside. In any case neither
side caii secure an overwdielming victory.
The Hare system of voting bars that sort
of punishment for political malefactoi-s. By
making it practically impossible for the elec-
tors to completely annihilate one party at
the polls, that voting system amounts to a
condonation of the most grievous political
offences.
Insulin and the Medical Press.
The conclusions of a country med.: —
With a pessimism that is becoming habitual the
Medical Journal of Australia tells us in an edi-
torial that the sooner the public can be persuaded
to forget the word “insulin” the better it will be
for the victims of the “uncanny disease” of diabetes.
This outburst is hard to understand in view of the
well-considered, logical, scientific and withal modest
reports of the discoverers of insulin. Professor
MacLeod, of Toronto, writing in the British
Medical Journal of August 4, 1923, describes the
experiments which led to the isolation of the sub-
stance and the physiological effects of its injec-
tion into the systems of both human and animal dia-
betics. The results were constant and conclusive;
and it was shown that by means of insulin the
percentage of blood-sugar could be controlled, and
hence also the onset of the graver symptoms of dia-
betes.
That the drug is potent is admitted; also that
its gross misuse is likely to be accompanied by very
untoward results. It is not considered advisable
to administer the substance to diabetics whose malady
could be adequately controlled by dieting. There
are some diabetics, however, in' such a pass that no
regimen, however 'strict, is availing, and many more
whose symptoms may be controlled only by a diet
little removed from utter starvation. It is for
“ONCE ON A TIME THEBE WAS A MAN.”
“With malice toward none, with charity for all'. . . .let us bind up the nations’ wounds. . . .”
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
CITIZEN OF THE WORLD: “Ah, if America were only now led by someone like you!”
these that insulin seems likely to prove more than
useful; and enough clinical evidence has been
obtained during the last 12 months in Canada and
England to bear out the hopes of its sponsors.
Against over-dosage adequate safeguards are provided,
firstly, by fairly frequent estimation of the blood-
sugar, or, if this should fail and through some error
in technique on the part of the physician, the adminis-
tration of glucose and (in some circumstances)
pitruitrin causes the subsidence of the alarming
symptoms. What more could one ask?
The writer of the editorial, who in the nature of
things can have had no more practical experience of
his subject matter than the rest of us, objects to
inculin ostensibly on the grounds (1) of lack of
permanency of the treatment — i.e the injections in
the present state of our knowledge must be given at
the proper intervals—and (2) of the inability of the
average medico to make an accurate computation of
the blood-sugar content. The necessity of continuity
of treatment is admittedly a disadvantage; but would
any doctor, for that reason, withhold treatment from,
say, those myxo-doematous sufferers whom thyroid-
gland extract changes from imbeciles to men? In
any case, as MacLeod, Banting and others point out,
. there is no evidence to show that the rest given to
the insulin-producing tissues in the body by the
introduction of exogenous insulin will n:t result in
the rehabilitation of these tissues. This phenome-
non has already been observed in the dog.
With regard to the second 1 objection we have the
word of Professor Robertson and Dr, de Crespigny,
of Adelaide, that any average medical student
can learn the technique of blood-sugar estimation
in on e day, and a competent nurse in four days; and
Professor Robertson and Dr. de Crespigny alone
amongst Australian workers have had practical and
clinical experience of insulin. Special sets for the
purpose have been on sale in England for some
months; and as a matter of fact the procedure pre-
sents no difficulties at all even for the country prac-
titioner whom the Journal, with its horizon shut
off by the tall buildings of Macquarie-street, is at
some pains to deride.
The real reason of the Journal’s opposition, in the
opinion of one who has read very carefully the
available literature on the subject, is an unreasoning
hatred of any advance in medical therapy which is
sufficiently dramatic to warrant notice in those
dreadful sheets which it contemptuously lumps to-
gether as “the lay press.”
Britain’s “Cheap Breakfast.”
The Argus lately put it this way
The fact that there are now 1,250,000 unemployed
in Great Britain, whereas France, Belgium and
Italy are industrially active, is due to the cir-
cumstance that Britain is paying her debts and
taxing her people heavily.
France may not be paying her debts, but she
is supporting an army of close on a million
men, and she has poured out money on the
restoration of her industrial areas. Unlike
Britain, she has a protective tariff, with
these results —that she has no unemploy-
ment problem (the capitalist is, in fact, find-
ing it increasingly difficult to buy labor) ; that
hundreds of thousands of would-be workers
are not having their self-respect sapped by
the receipt of State doles; that Frenchmen
are able to remain Frenchmen instead of
going into exile; and that government is
stable. Britain’s army of unemployed is no
new thing. Years before the World War
the social reformer Booth proclaimed that
“there are 12i millions in the U.K. either
starving or -on the verge of starvation.”
These unfortunates were not the victims of
the debt-paying habit or of taxation, but of
the “cheap breakfast-table.” The voting
power over most of Britain is still in the
hands of the small, harried man in a poor
job which just keeps him and his family.
His wage or salary is small, and if he asks
for an increase his employer explains that
incomes in countries which enjoy the price-
less heritage of a cheap breakfast-table
always have been small and always must be.
With this assurance the petitioner goes hope-
lessly away and votes for Freetrade. Yet
in so doing he must know, if he has any
reasoning powers, that li£ is voting for some-
thing which will diminish his capacity to
pay for his cheap breakfast, to the extent
ultimately of making it an extremely dear
breakfast. For the past five years the Brit-
ish taxpayer has had to pay over 75 millions
sterling per annum in unemployment doles
alone. A rough calculation of what this
means, not only in lessened incomes to those
who have to find the money, but in de-
teriorated national earning power, in social
unrest and in loss of population will show
that the Briton’s “cheap breakfast” is really
one of the most expensive luxuries he enjoys.
»
There was nothing bashful about Prime Min-
ister Bruce’s plea that the British Govern-
ment should reduce the interest on Austra-
lia’s war debt to the moderate figure which
Britain is itself charged by the United
States. The argument was that Australia
had been the first of the States to fund the
debt it owed to the Old Man in London —
in other words, to hand over its written
10U and fix dates of repayment —and
that it had acquired special jnerit thereby.
It certainly was prompt, one reason being
that a pretty big sum advanced by Britain
as wages for Australian troops was payable
in casli on a fixed date, and to prevent the
default looking too glaring a p.n. was
offered in haste. When the war accounts
began to be disentangled it was found that
Australia owed the British Government more
than all the other Dominions and Colonies
put together, Hughes being an expensive
and casual campaigner. In fact, Canada
had done such solid work in the way of
supplying arms, ammunition and sundries
for the war that it ow T ed nothing, and had
a big sum to collect—but, then, it wasn’t
run by Hughes. The loans which Britain
made to various Allies have proved so far
a magnificent array of bad debts, and the
one streak of luck the Old Man had in the
whole business was that he beat down his
Yankee creditor a point in the interest
rate. But his position is still that he is
paying interest on a thousand millions of
war borrowings and getting nothing out of
a thousand millions of war lendings. Aus-
tralia suggests that it should stand in with
the Old Man on his one streak of luck; but
it proposes to let the Old Man have all the
non-paying war-lendings himself. It really
looks a bit mean of an able-bodied son—
especially at the moment when said able-
bodied son is talking in a very loud voice
of the vast natural wealth of his own estate.

“Gunner” : The “Girl Graduate in Munich”
w r ho writes (B. 25/10/’23) of the “harrow-
ing tales of children being shot down for
making faces at French officers” and con-
cludes : “One simply can’t dismiss all the
evidence,” does not greatly impress me. As
lan Hamilton says in his latest book,
“lies about the enemy are as necessary in
war-time as poison gas” ; and it has to be
remembered that France and Germany are
virtually at war. As I 'write there lies be-
fore me a “dodger” (propaganda variety)
consisting of a photograph of some children
surrounded by an inscription in Spanish.
Translated, the latter reads :
TERRORISED !
A lucky snapshot taken by an American reporter
residing in Berlin who travelled the Ruhr territory
for his employers (a Chicago newspaper). The
reporter was able to surprise this scene in front of
a house at the very moment a French officer and
his men arrived there!
The children are standing in line with their
arms out. At a glance they might be ward-
ing off a posse of soldiers, though why they
should have attempted the task, and why the
soldiers should have allowed the American
reporter to photograph the scene, appears
strange. Still stranger that the youngsters
had obviously been “dressed” and “sized,” as
they say in the army, before facing the
enemy. The explanation is afforded by a
copy of the Hamburger Fremdenblatt
(9/4/’23), which features a number of phy-
sical-culture pictures on its “Woman’s
Page.” Prominent amongst them is the iden-
tical photograph that is now being exploited
by the Berlin hate-purveyors : it shows the
youngsters performing a well-known physical-
jerks movement. The discovery did not sur-
prise me. I took the trouble to investigate
half a dozen blood-curdling and universally
believed propaganda yarns (Bi-itisli) while
at Querrieu and thereabouts in TB, and found
that every one of them was a baseless lie.

William Clowes calls for a large reform:—
Our present method of dividing the year, arranged
and amended from time to time by churches, States
and accidents, is on a par with the English system
of land measurements. It takes us half our lives to
learn how many days there are in each month. In
the middle of the month it calls for much calculation
(failing an almanac) to find what day the month
commenced on, and we are too tired to reckon up
what day Christmas will fall on. Now, the whole
thing can be made perfectly simple and regular in
five minutes from the time the nations interested
say the word. It is only necessary to divide the year
into 13 months of 28 days each. Start every month
on a Sunday or Monday, as may be arranged, for the
first day of the month, and make one day of the
year, say, Christmas or New Year’s Day, without a
date at all, so that the sequence of the days and
their dates will not be disturbed by the odd day in
the year. Thus, as December, like all other months,
would commence on a Monday, Christmas Day would,
by present methods, come on Thursday, 25th; but
by my method it would come between Wednesday, 24th,
and Thursday, 25th, and would just rank in the
calendar as Christmas Day—no date. At leap-year
Boxing Day would be coupled with Christmas Dav
and treated in the same way. If the idea had suffi-
cient publicity, the system would come into use as
surely as the metric system will some day.

POLITICAL
POINTS
It is getting on for 7S years since a
Tory Priminister, returned as a Protection-
ist, went over to Cobdenism and rent his
party in the process. Last week another
Tory Priminister announced at Plymouth
that he had come to the conclusion that
“the only way to fight unemployment is by
protecting the home market.” It is a de-
liverance that will become historic, but for
the present it means only that the next elec-
tion will be fought on the fiscal issue; no
change is to be made during the lifetime of
the present Parliament, which may last till
1927. As to preferential trade, there are
to be “slight extensions or adaptations of a
principle sanctioned by the Legislature”—-
preferential duties obtain in respect of
chicory, cinematograph films, cocoa, coffee,
(Med fruits, sugar, tea, tobacco and wine—-
but nothing further until more is sanctioned
by the electorate. And when that may be
no man can tell.
Distracted at the prospect of the bond-
holder demanding fulfilment of Queensland s
promise to repay the seven loans maturing
on July 1, Theodore will hasten to London,
when the Parliamentary session is over, to
avert what he calls “the horrible menace.
Meantime, as a sop to the brutal creditor,
cattlemen whose Grown rents were raised
under the 1920 Repudiation Act are to have
them “reviewed” for five years from July 1.
1921. In view of this act of contrition, and
of the £9 ISs. sd. standing to the credit of
the General Debt Reduction Fund, the “hor-
rible menace” may pass. Yet the Old Man
is sure to demand a higher rate of interest
on his 12-odd millions, three of the loans
having been floated at p.c. and four at
4 p.c. The price of Queensland’s improvi-
dence (it has had from 32 to 39 years to
save up the money) will be at least £200,000
a year for the term of the renewal loan,
whatever it may be.
Archdeacon Boyce, of Sydney, is one of the
few who still hold with local option :
“Pussyfoot” Johnson when in Svdnev said that the
winning line of action was “first the town, then
the city, then the country, then the State, and then
the nation.”
As this fine old citizen, but misguided en-
thusiast, naively remarks, “a policy of elec-
torate option would be all but certain to
win several of the 24 large areas.” And if it
did more harm than good would come of it.
The rich and near-rich would get all they
wanted: liquor would be taken into homes
where it was never taken before. The poor
would be catered for as well; but if there was
any difficulty about their getting liquor, the
tendency would be to drive them out of decent
districts into those where local option hasn t
a hope. Nation-wide prohibition is at least
arguable: local option is merely a device to
enable residents who can get all the drink
they want outside the electorate, to be vir-
tuous at the expense of residents who can’t
manage it so easily.
Some remarks die hard. Premier Dibbs’s
“Damn Chicago!” was one of them. Gover-
nor Beauchamp’s “birtlistain” was another.
A third sample was ex-Premier Dooley’s
description of his political masters as “un-
couth crooks.” But something beyond the
average was Premier Fuller’s invocation of
“the indomitable spirit of Anzac” in his
appeal to N.S.W. to borrow even more than
it is doing, and have a jolly time, and squash
the next generation with the bill. The
“bold policy” of sending baby to Gallipoli
while his old man loafs and drinks beer at
home is something that should be put into
song.
The bill to amend the Crimes Act, which
Attorney-General Bavin (N.S.W.) hopes to
get through this session, contains this sound
proposal:—
Any presumption of law that an offence com-
mitted by a wife in the presence of her husband is
committed under the coercion of the husband is
abolished.
Attention was focussed on this idiotic law
during the recent Peel case in England.
This was a racing swindle in which, though
the wife supplied the money and most of the
brains, the husband went to gaol alone, on
the presumption that the lady had acted
under compulsion. As instancing the lengths
to which the doctrine is carried, a married
woman had actually pleaded guilty to a
crime at the Old Bailey, when the Recorder
discovered that her husband had been with
her when the offence was committed. He
promptly discharged her. The coercion con-
vention dates back, of course, to early feudal
times. The marriage vows have similar
origin, and are a source of natural irritation
to logical-minded women’s righters.
Prohibition is now receiving the attention
of the philosophic historians and the psy-
chologists. R. 11. Towner, whose two-
“IN GOOD KING CHARLES’S DAY.”
“A man in Victoria has been fined 58. under an Act of Charles 11. for bringing in a load of fire-
wood on Sunday.”
SHADE OF CHARLES : “Ho, ho! Look at ’em! Posterity makes a man acquainted with
strange bedfellows!”
volumed “Philosophy of Civilisation” is
the most-talked-of American work of its
class this season, had, of course, to deal with
the whole question of liquor and liquor con-
trol. Ilis conclusions on a matter recently re-
ferred to by the Australian Prof. Griffith
Taylor are definite
Where alcoholic beverage is freely used, intellect
has always risen. Where drinking and non-drinking
nations come into armed conflict, the former always
win. Instead of destroying the groups to which it
was known, it has made them ever victorious. They
are universally superior, corporally and spiritually,
to the non-drinking groups.
As for Prohibition, apart from its inherent
wrongness, it begets, naturally and inevitably,
an army of spies, without which it is unen-
forceable. And as espionage rotted the moral
fibre of Spain and Italy under the Inquisi-
tion, so it will rot the moral fibre of any
other country that persists with Prohibition.
Besides the drought in the North and West and
the falling due of 3| and 4 p.c. London loans,
the Theodore Government is troubled with
domestic dissension. A.L.P. branches pro-
test that it has departed in recent legisla-
tion from the platform shaped at the Emu
Park Conference. Militant Reds and mod-
erate union secretaries are equally dissatis-
fied. There are also malcontents in the
Caucus, and if the wilder spirits have then-
way an independent party of industrialists
will burst into being. Much more likely is
the formation of a left wing, voting with
the Government on vital issues and flailing
it when it doesn’t move fast enough.
George Reid’s Six Llatters campaign, in
which Australia was represented as a semi-
savage standing with a billhook to push civil-
ised immigrants off into deep water, still
bears fruit. Frank Tate, Vic. Director of
Education, found that most Swedes and
Danes didn’t know anything else about Aus-
tralia except that immigrants weren t
allowed to land there !
The cables tell us:—
Viscount Goto has announced officially that the
known deaths caused by the Japanese earthquake and
fire total 150,000.
As The Bueletin observed when the news
came through, earthquakes are hardly ever
half so black as the press first paints them.
Regarded as a world-Power, Japan is as for-
midable to-day as she was before the dis-
aster. Australia is growing feebler on land
and sea, and Britain —somewhat weary may-
bo of our practice of doing nothing for the
Flag but cheer it—is not showing- anything
like her old disposition to indefinitely pro-
tect our sea trade. This country’s tragic
weakness cannot be obscured by sniggering
“Alarmist!” at men who speak the sober
truth, as Senator Plain did a few days ago.
And least of all from the penetrating eyes
of the Japanese.
In an expansive moment, Bill Everard, the
berry-growers’ champion, moved a no-con-
fidence motion (so he persuaded himself it
was) in Vic. Assembly, but found himself
alone, and let himself be defeated on the
voices. The casus belli was the Govern-
ment’s refusal to reduce railway freights
and fares. Treasurer McPherson weaved in
swiftly with a “can’t-be-done” speech, the
burden of which was that increases had
taken place in most countries of the world ;
that Vic. had been moderate compared with
some (20 p.c. less than N.S.W., for in-
stance) ; and that even a 5 p.c. reduction
would mean a deficit of £500,000. Bourchier
and Dunstan, of the Cocky malcontents, and
Beardmore, the passed-over leader of the
Country Liberals, presented arguments for
a decrease, but had they talked till they
were black in the face the Government wou'd
have remained unmoved. Unfortunately
when Governments won’t move, the country
producer sometimes has to. If he has to
pay higher prices for everything he buys,
and can’t get higher prices for anything he
sells, then he simply has to throw in the
sponge.
A picture of the Dawson Valley land
which is to be irrigated on the day-labor
principle was recently exhibited in one of
the rooms at Brisbane Parliament House.
Next day there was hung alongside it a sheet
of blotting-paper bearing the legend “Bowen
Iron and Steel Works,” which were to have
been built with the £9,000.000 London loan
that Theodore didn’t get. The blotting-
paper was an inspiration of genius. Labor
loan-jobs being noted for their absorbent
qualities.
A curious legal back-kick of our compli-
cated industrial law has struck a bricklayer in
Melbourne. Working on the construction of a
motor-garage, he sustained an injury which
led to his instituting a suit under the Work-
men’s Compensation Act. It was at this
point the Law let loose the unexpected hoot.
Having elicited that the tradesman had been
earning over £8 per week, it drew his atten-
tion to the fact that on his own statement
he had ceased to be a “workman” within
the meaning of the Act. If lie had loafed
sufficiently and earned a pound or so less,
the fool-law would have had no qualms it
would have passed him as a real workman.
As Vic. Premier Lawson was away nurs-
ing a cold, it fell to Allan to compliment
Irvine on the excellence of his imitation of a
Rubber Stamp during Gov. Stradbrokes
absence. Older political birds like Peacock,
Robinson and McPherson had to sit back
and watch the head of the Cocky party take
this lead at the Executive Council meeting.
But to do Allan justice he is anything but
an assertive person, and must have more
than once in the past few weeks said A
plague on precedence!”
Very little work has been done by the
Vic. Parliament since Premier Lawson came
back from his world-tour. Unless there is
a wonderful speeding up in November, and
for three weeks in December, there is no-
thing for it but a summer session, and the
old dog-show wing of the Exhibition Build-
ing now used as a Parliament House is un-
suitable for such emergencies. Twenty years
ago Irvine, then Premier, borrowed the
Spring-street Houses, tenanted by the Com-
monwealth Parliament for a summer session.
That was when his Reform Bill was passed.
The first N.S.W. Labor Ministry (1910)
included McGowen, Premier and Treasurer ;
Beebv, Instruction and Labor; Trefle, Agri-
culture ; Macdonell, Colonial Secretary
michael, Assistant Treasurer; Griffith,
Works; Edden, Mines; Holman, Justice ;
Nielsen, Lands; and Flowers, V.P. Leg.
Council. Trefle and Macdonell have an-
swered the Last Division bell; Holman is
at the Bar and Beeby is on the Bench, Edden
is a political Julius Caesar, and Carmichael,
Griffith and Nielsen are dim shapes in twi-
light. Wasn’t it Danton who said in the
evening of his days: “Better be a poor
fisherman by the seashore than take any
part in the government of men”?
According to the verdict in Holman v. the
Perth Sunday Times, it may be libellous to
call a Labor candidate a Communist. Having
fastened the appellation on Holman, who
stood for Fremantle at the Federal election
last year, the paper went on to explain that,
being a Communist of the Russian descrip-
tion, he was “up to his neck in the German
conspiracy against British industry,” and
the jury decided it was worth £3OO and costs.
Actually, Holman was a conscriptionist, and,
though well over the military age and with
a numerous progeny, he volunteered for war
service. One of the 190.1 batch of West-
ralian Labor Assemblymen (he arrived at a
by-election a few months after the original
six), he represented Murchison for 20 years
and was Works Minister for a few months
in the Daglish Government. He has been
secretary of the timber-workers’ union for
ever so long.
“O. McKay M.”: The Bulletin deplores
(18/10/’23) the “medheval attitude of our
laws towards mental defectives.” I sug-
gest that the administration rather than the
letter of the law is at fault. For instance,
Section 425 of the Victorian Crimes Act,
1915, lays it down that a person who, in the
opinion of a jury, has committed a crime
while insane may be ordered by the Court to
be held until the Governor’s pleasure is
known. The Governor can order confinement
during his pleasure. If or when such a per-
son is released, the Governor may impose
such conditions as he thinks fit, and any
Court of Petty Sessions is empowered to
punish breach of those conditions bv order-
ing a return of the defective to confinement.
If those provisions were observed, and if
Judges and juries were a little more prompt
in including Puddifoots and Froggatts in
the “insane” group, the community might
feel more secure.
“T.P.”: In the Austin Hospital an ex-
soldier is dying of T.B. He has a wife and
five kiddies, the eldest 11, but no pension.
The authorities, it is understood, contend
that the disease in this case antedates the
war. The family being destitute, it is left
to a couple of benevolent societies to do the
best they can for them. This case is not an
isolated one, but surely if men were accepted
as fit for service by Government medical
officers the onus is on the Government to
treat them as if they were fit when they
joined up. In a civil action a jury would
almost for a certainty find in the man’s
favor for three reasons: (1) If lie was
tubercular the Government shouldn’t have
accepted him; (2) after accepting him it
caused him to expose himself to conditions
which favored the development of the dis-
ease; and (3) it kept him from making that
provision for his family which lie might-
have made if he had remained at home—he
mightn’t have made any provision, but there
are thousands who did, and we kept him
from being one of those thousands.
THE WAY OF THE STALWART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Theodore will consider the question of
going into Federal polities at the end of his present
term in the Queensland State Parliament.”
It’s good to ride on the Labor wave and dine with
Mr. Fat,
On the bacon’s back to swank around for the Pro-
letariat ;
It’s nice to sail on the tranquil sea of the socialistic
State,
To bask in the balm of a three-year calm is indeed
a glorious fate.
The “slaves” “go dead,” as the Abos. say, when once
the poll’s declared ;
The “stalwart” stows their “chains” away, when
their grievances are aired ;
The plebiscite is a ghost that fades and (lies at an
early age,
And the stalwart’s safe in the Labor play on the
Red Objective stage.
The youth that taps the selection door with a life's
ambition hot
Cools off at ease in the rushing breeze of the stal-
wart’s chariot;
And the stalwart swanks in the first saloon of the
(socialistic barque,
While the levied slave toils on for aye in the stoke-
hole’s dusty dark.
The Union “heads” to the stalwart go to plead for
the rank and file,
And hate the job, for they know his way and his
bureaucratic style;
But the whip cracks loud in the hustings dust
and the Union secs, all quail—
They fear the wrath of the stalwart clad in his
Parliamentary mail.
Then when the “call to a higher sphere” rings loud
in the stalwart’s ears,
Again he jangles the poor slaves’ chains and tunes
up the r hopes and fears.
So the wold kow-tows to the stalwart king as
he stamps on the Labor planks—
But a lot of “slaves” are growing wise in the Pro-
letariat’s ranks.

*Portion of year only.
According to the published accounts, the
year’s net profit was £596 short of the
amount required to pay 74 p.c. But the
directors do not count as profit £25,000 which
they dropped into an insurance fund, or
£12,500 placed to credit of a repairs, re-
newals and replacement reserve, it is prac-
tically certain that the £37,500 so appropri-
ated was true profit, because depreciation
was otherwise provided for, and it is only
four years since £240,000 set aside for in-
surance and £320,000 reserved for replace-
ments were both converted into bonus scrip.
It is probable, therefore, that the net profit
was nearer the £211,289 shown in the intro-
ductory table (giving 9 p.c. on capital) than
the figures disclosed by the directors. That
result is remarkable in view of (!)■ the de-
pressed—or, at any rate, uneven—state of the
coastal shipping trade; (2) the small re-
serves of this co. in relation to its heavily
bonus-inflated capital; and (3) the large
holdings of gilt-edged securities turning in
5 p.c. or so. Obviously some of the hold-
ings in other cos. have been producing fat
returns. Anyway, shareholders have had
their usual 74 p.c. iliv., and as they received
three shares for one in the 1920 reconstruc-
tion, the return on the £775,045 of capital
prior to that year—and £202,870 of it was
bonus scrip—-runs to 224 p.c. for old holders.
The management continues to conceal the
true liquid position of the co. When ship-
ping was at war-boom values, the directors
sold a number of steamers at prices greatly in
excess of their book-values, and most of the
proceeds went into Government securities
pending the replacement of the vessels sold.
So far there has not been much inducement
to add to the fleet, and the management still
holds an unspecified amount of gilt-edged
securities which it includes with fixed assets
and shares in other cos. in the published
balance-sheets. At June 30 there were
slightly more than 2| millions in that
composite item; in addition £323,662 of
Commonwealth loans were shown separately,
besides other liquid assets (including stocks
and stores) totalling £291,540. So far as
it can be probed the liquid position for the
past three years has varied in this way:—
1921. 1922. 1923.
Liquid assets ..£595,048 £609,563 £615,202
Liabilities (excluding
Provident Fund). . 241,880 192,879 232,331
Surplus assets ..£353,168 £416,684 £382,871
The comparisons are not of much value
without information as to the volume of
Government IQU’s tucked away elsewhere
and as to the nature of the numerous inter-
ests in other cos. However, the figures dis-
close how very snug is the co.’s position
nowadays: visible investments in public
securities alone exceed all outside liabilities
by £91,000-odd. The settlement in the
co.’s favor by the House of Lords of the
Warialda collision dispute and the pay-
ment of compensation by the S. Aus. Har-
bors Board for the resumption of the co.'s
Commercial Wharf at Port Adelaide have
no doubt expanded cash holdings. However,
they will be cut into soon. So far only
small vessels have been commissioned, but
contracts have been let for the construc-
tion of two steamers each of about 5000
tons deadweight. Further, the general-
manager is off to England to “study the
latest developments,” and the marine super-
intendent has been there for some months.
From an investor’s point of view the Adel-
aide S. S. is a proposition very different
from wliat- it was a few years ago. There
are now 2,325,135 shares to receive divs.,
and a lot of that scrip came from the writing-
up of assets. Capital nowadays is assisted
by less than £167,000 of visible reserves.

The deficit in the table is the amount of capi-
tal which is not represented by tangible
assets. The £73,353 is not the full measure
of the ebb flow of shareholders’ funds. The ex-
cess of outgo (including establishment and ex-
tension) over and above Life department
revenue has been £92,103, and in the Acci-
dent branch £3500; and £12,500 in shares
to the promoter has been paid away.
The actual deficit is greater, because
to that total of £108,103 must be added the
actuarial liability under policies which
existed at August 31 and for which no pro-
vision had been made, and, so far as ordi-
naries are concerned, there is a further
accrued liability (approximately £10,000) to
holders of the 125,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs.
fully-paid to 10s. Including this commit-
ment, the cost of formation, of establishing
19 branches throughout the Commonwealth
and Dominion and in S’Africa and the ex-
cess of working exes, over income have run
into £llB,OOO-odd, besides an unknown
amount required for policy reserves. How-
ever, the management is not confronted with
making good the whole of that deficit; those
shareholders who were induced to pay ss.
premium by the talk of glittering prospects
recouped £31,250, and the actual amount to
be made good before capital has the backing
of 20s. in the £ of tangible assets is £70,853,
plus the gradually increasing reserve re-
quired for Life contracts and plus pref. divs.
accruing.
During the period of 19 months covered
by the first accounts 3911 policies for
£1,105,350 ( less re-insurances), producing
an annual premium income of £47,850, were
put on the books. For the 12 months to
August 31 last 4526 policies for £1,263,233,
carrying an annual premium income of
£50.272, were accepted. In addition, the
Accident branch had a premium income of
£15,024 for the past year. Of course, not
all the policies written have been continued :
for instance, against the £47,850 of pre-
miums which the business of the first
accounts showed, last year’s renewal pre-
miums amounted to only £30,526. Assuming
80 p.c. of last year’s new business sticks, the
Southern Cross has developed a premium in-
come of approximately £85,000 from Life and
Accident policies. The future depends en-
tirely on the management keeping down costs,
and thus permitting sufficient premium in-
come to accumulate for policy liabilities.
The directors’ report declares that all
branches are now "practically self-support-
ing, and, therefore, the future can be faced
in the most optimistic manner.” The “Wild
Cat” will be very surprised if that desirable
stage in the eo.’s career has been reached;
for the past 12 months the outgo in claims
and expenses, eliminating £lO,OOO charged
as additional “establishment expenses,” was
£10,534 more than total premium and inter-
est receipts. For operations to have become
“self-supporting,” the position must have so
changed that revenue exceeds expenses and
claims and also provides reserves for the
amounts accruing under policies. The size
of the assurance business considered in rela-
tion to the cost of maintaining almost a
score of branches suggests that a much
larger volume of steady renewal premiums
is required, and that the cost of winning-
new assurances must be cheapened. Disre-
garding the £lO,OOO charged to establishment,
and also £2OOO written off equipment, last
year’s renewals cost-rate was 20.4 p.c. and
the new-business rate 204 p.c.—taking as a
basis for calculation that the cost of new-
business is 10 times that of old.
The accounts of the Ordinary branch
showed £87,076 of income: premiums
accounted for £72,086, and interest, rent, “ap-
preciation of assets within valuation there-
of” and other receipts put in £14,990. During
the year the co. bought premises in Mel-
bourne, and the directors announce that
“within a few weeks” written offers were
made for the building at an advance of
£30.000 on the price paid. On the strength
of these offers they have taken the premises
into the books, not at cost price, but at “80
p.c. of its valuation.” The extent of the
inflation is not disclosed, but £2OOO of it
was employed to write down the book value
of motor-cars, office furniture and fittings
to “bedrock value.” After this juggling
freehold properties had a book value of
£84,846 ; on the other side £67,500 had been
raised by mortgaging the premises. Other
assets were public securities, £65.758 ; mort-
gages, £13.223: loans, £7458; agents’
balances, £12,920; outstanding premiums
and premiums within days of grace, £12,869 ;
cash and interest accrued, £3547: sundry
debtors, £5936. Stationery and office and
field equipment had book values totalling
£11,755.
Tlie heavy cost of establishment and of
life-writing operations lias so far not been
a matter of concern to policy-holders. There
are net tangible assets for £120,000 or so,
and that far exceeds existing liabilities under
policies. The outlook for shareholders, how-
ever, is certainly not of the “brightest
nature.’’ Under the most favorable circum-
stances some years of profitable operations
are required to recover sufficient of the de-
ficit to warrant policy-holders hoping for
bonuses or shareholders dreaming of divs.
And, of course, the ordinaries will be well
in the background when divisible surpluses
do show up. Those who paid up 7s. 6d. per
10s. share—a half-crown call was made dur-
ing the past year—and not forgetting those
who contributed ss. per share premium, have
the prefs. ahead of them, and divs. accruing
at the rate of £5OOO p.a.

Happenings in the Modern Permanent Build-
ing Society during the past year have had a
bearing on the affairs of the Southern Cross
Assurance, which purchased the Modern’s
freehold premises. Thirteen years ago the
Modern Permanent, which had a rough spin
when the Melbourne land-boom crashed,
effected a final clean-up by writing down
values to what then appeared to be safe
levels. The book value of the Collins-street
property was reduced from £78,000 to
£50,000, and it remained at that figure until
the recent sale to the Southern Cross. The
Modern’s, latest accounts show a net sur-
plus on realisation of assets amounting to
£24,505, and that was almost wholly from
the Modern building, because the only other
sale of property was the trifle of £424 (book
value) of old vacant lands still held when
the financial year opened. These figures sug-
gest that the assurance co. paid approxi-
mately £74,500, plus, perhaps, commission,
etc., on the deal. The Southern Cross wrote
up the cost price, and at August 31 the
building, fittings and additions were given a
book value of £84,846. This, the assurance
co. announced, was 80 p.c. of the valuation,
others having “within a few weeks of the
purchase made written offers for the building
at an advance of £30,000 on the price paid.”
So a comparatively old building which was
conservatively valued at £50,000 a dozen
years ago is now in demand at £105,000 or
so. Even assuming that the Modern people
treated values too drastically in their recon-
struction, the appreciation shown by the
offers made to the Southern Cross is the
most striking evidence of the newest boom
in property values. Perhaps it is on sounder
foundations than the one of the ’eighties;
but it is a boom, nevertheless, which has
been developed artificially. It is not neces-
sary to look beyond the effects of the war
“prosperity” and the financial status of the
purchasing co. in this particular case, to
learn the nature of the inflation.
In its 1922 financial year the Modern
Building Society showed a net return of
£3778 from its premises, that amount return-
ing slightly more than 74 p.c. on the written-
down book value. The net return was less,
because to finance its advances the property
was mortgaged for £25,000. The sale has,
therefore, made £49,500 more available for
mortgage. Some of the proceeds have already
been lent out, but apparently the society is
still carrying a considerable portion of the
sale price, holding a mortgage from the
Southern Cross. The latter’s accounts
showed a £67,500 blister on the property;
the Modern merely adds an “etcetera” to its
balance-sheet statement of mortgages. The
building society’s position has so altered
that, after paying latest divs., there were
£63.000 of reserves backing £96,605 of paid
capital, and total funds have to earn only
a trifle more than 6 p.c. to return 10 p.c. oil
capital. D'iv. prospects have been bright-
ened by quitting the property, but the future
of the Society depends on the care which is
exercised when granting new advances. The
co.’s position is cosy: besides having large
reserves protecting capital, its outside liabili-
ties are small: at July 31 it was working on
only £16.671 of deposits and £5380 bank
overdraft, all outside debts totting up only
£22.812. The only assets other than the
“balances due on mortgages, etc.. £185,954.”
were £664 of accrued interest and odds-and-
ends.
Australasian Trustees, Executors and
Agency Go., Ltd. —Vic. Legislative Assem-
bly was stirred last week by “amazing revela-
tions” regarding the Southern Union Insur-
ance float. That co.'s chairman, general-
manager, two directors and solicitor are the
provisional directors of the proposed Austral-
asian i., E. and A. Co., Ltd., which has
been seeking Parliamentary approval to
establish a new trustee co. The bill was re-
ferred to a Select Committee, which made
amendments and then recommended accept-
ance ; but instead of adopting its recommen-
dation the Assembly has thrown the bill
back to the Committee to investigate the
directors’ association with the insurance co.
and the Security Underwriters Pty. The
latter was the “underwriting” concern with
a paid capital of £l5, owned by George aud
Mina Abbott, which harvested very large
commissions and sold scrip far in excess of
the insurance co.’s requirements; mostly
through its agency 1,892,364 shares were
placed. Nevertheless, Snowball, M.L.A., who
is fathering the trustee bill, declares that
“there was nothing in the incident that
was reprehensible.” The effects of the colos-
sal impudence of that venture were revealed bv
the “Wild Cat” last year (B. 12-19/10/’22
and 30/11/’22). The share-selling co.’s
affairs were also investigated by the Crown
Law Department, which decided that the
State had no power to interfere.

The belated inquiry which the Select Com-
mittee is to undertake has been ordered evi-
dently with the object of preventing a recur-
rence of the Southern Union promotion
methods. The Southern Union directors who
are seeking permission to establish the trus-
tee co. have thus been placed in the position
of justifying themselves, and as the infer-
ence has been made in Parliament that some
of the Board received a “cut” of the share-
commissions, they should not hesitate to
assist the committee to probe every corner
of the insurance boat. Some of the direc-
tors were certainly innocent to an extent;
with the lamb-like public they came in with
their good cash, though probably at par in-
stead of at the stiff premiums demanded by
the promoters after share-selling had
proved easy. One of the provisional direc-
tors of the trustee co. joined the insurance
Board when most of the damage had been
done. But one and all of them have, to
say the least, been indiscreet; it was their
business to make themselves fully acquainted
with the operations of the Security Under-
writers Pty., but they allowed the scheme to
continue without effective protest until the
eleventh hour of the float, when, even as lay-
men in insurance matters, they should have
known, as guardians of the interests of
existing and prospective shareholders, that
the stiff premiums asked for the shares
were not justified, and that, capital
far in excess of underwriting require-
ments had been raised. Apparently they
did not terminate the underwriting agree-
ment until some time after The Bulletin’s
disclosures, and they continued to sit with
Mr. Abbott on the Board. Hence the ques-
tion arises whether the insurance co.’s direc-
tors have displayed all those qualities which
a trustee concern requires.

The troubles which piled on Gold's
Hosiery Mills (Sydney) when the directors
intimated that they were not in a position
to pay instalments of debenture interest due
on September 1 and November 1 have eased
temporarily. Following on several confer-
ences between directors and committees re-
presenting the two classes of debenture-
holders, the co. announces that, “subject to
confirmation by debenture-holders, satisfac
tory arrangements have been agreed upon
which will permit the business of the co. to
be carried on.” The immediate effect of
the arrangement is the proposed appoint-
ment to the Board of F. W. Browne, manag-
ing-director of Wright, Heaton and Co., to
represent the second debs., and of Win. John-
stone, formerly managing-director of Lasset-
ter and Co., to watch the interests of the
“G” debs. The debenture-holders will now
have a direct voice in the management; in
fact, they and the bank will henceforward
practically control the co.’s affairs, unless
the directors can perform the miracle of re-
placing a big portion of the debts with fixed
capital. The co.’s financial troubles have
been due to the policy of depending wholly
on borrowed money to finance the expansion
of the business. The position as at June
30 was reviewed by the “Wild Cat” last week
(B. 25/10/’23).
“Ex-Broker”: Melbourne Stock Exchange
is suffering for the sins of those boom-time
committeemen who invested £100,090 in half
the E., S. and A. Bank corner in 1887, and
put up fantastic premises. The building was
and is still a tragic failure, and the dark,
dull, airless call-room, approached by lifts
with a capacity of four passengers, has
killed many good brokers by gradual suffo-
cation and lung diseases. To get the
£lOO,OOO, the committee boomed the price
of seats to £2500, averaging about £1750, for
50 extra seats that never should have been
created. There are 129 seats, or 79 too
many for the business to be done. In-
stead of buying back and cancelling the need-
less seats, the committee actually struggles
to keep them filled. The fewer the members
the more business they divide, and the more
valuable are their seats. Tell that to a
Melbourne sharebroker, and he will reply:
“It’s not true ; the more members the more

The value and adaptability of Pioneer Wood Pipe
has been proved in hundreds of installations ranging
in locality from the tropic north of Queensland to
the snowy highlands of Tasmania. Wood is a non-
conductor which serves to keep the water cool in
the hottest climate and protects the conduit itself
fronv frost-bursting in cool places. Other advantages
of Pioneer Wood Pipe are its cleanliness, its immunity
from corrosion, and electrolysis, its lightness, sim-
plicity and cheapness. Find out more about this
modern conduit. Our illustrated book will give

General-manager George Weir doesn’t bore
Rroken Hill North shareholders by the length
of his latest report. Indeed, a little more
information might well have been vouch-
safed • for instance, the £52,000 allocated for
expenditure on plant might be explained,
and some figures supplied as to slnne dumps
on hand, etc. A feature of the directors
report is Weir’s recommendation of the
British purchase. Evidently his long so-
journ in Collins House, with only a trip or
two per annum to the Hill, has altered the
views he held in the days when some of his
directors wanted to tie the Junction North
with the North. At that time Weir was so
much against the proposed fusion that he
had a carpenter locked in his office for a
couple of weeks making a wooden model ot
the two mines, to show the Board the error
of its ways. Yet there was far more justifi-
cation for that proposition than for the
British one. It will be of interest to note
what becomes of Amalgamated Zinc plant,
which will finish its career of usefulness dur-
ing the next few months unless the slime
dumps at the North are passed over. The
plant is all on North leases. It is, of
course, possible that Amalgamated Zinc may
yet pick up the North slime-dumps. And
there is a bit at the British, too, which
might come in handy. It is not improbable
that the North will sink a new mainshaft on
the Victoria Cross lease; although the bulk
of the developed ore is on the old North
lease there is a fair bit of ore on the Vic-
toria Cross side.

Broken Hill Prop, is to re-open its mine
shortly and try its luck with the. all-flota-
tion process, which has proved such a winner
on dump treatment. This means the scrap-
ping of the huge gravity-treatment plant, but
it will be justified by high recoveries and a
cleaner separation of the metals into the
respective concentrates. One drawback will
be that the concentrates will be practically
all slimy, but that doesn’t matter so much
as it used to. Somerset and his staff at
I’irie Smelters will tackle anything with
lead and silver in it (and a bit of copper,
too, if it comes to that) and turn out the
finished metal without trouble. Pirie has
got over all the difficulties that the German
smelters used to make such a fuss about in
days gone by. The adoption of the new
system by the Prop, does not necessarily
mean that other mines will rush in. Ine
silver tenor needs to be high to warrant the
extra cost of grinding fine for flotation.
* * * *
Wallaroo and Moonta’s position has be-
come so desperate that shareholders have
been called together in Adelaide to-day
(Thursday) to consider whether the co.
should be put into liquidation. Only five
years ago there were reserves exceeding a
quarter-million —more than £200,000 ot
them had accumulated in the previous seven
years, when a half-million (156 j p.c. on
capital) had been distributed in divs. The
only div. since 1918 was 7J p.c. in 19_1).
By June 30 last all reserves had been ex-
hausted, and Profit and Loss was £161,737
to the bad. Worse still, £161,919 of debt
had piled up, and that was only £14,593 more
than the tally of all liquid assets, including
stocks of metal, stores, etc. The drift has
continued, and as the copper market is _ still
very low and the future uncertain, neither
the" bank nor private financiers can be ex-
pected to provide the funds required to con-
tinue production, or even to maintain the
mine and plant in good condition if the co.
decided to shut down indefinitely. It seems
almost impossible to avert the tragedy of a
wind-up. In their declining days. the mines
have only low-grade stuff available, and
under existing working conditions and in
present markets profit-earning is out of the
question. The suggestion in the S. Aus.
Leg. Assembly that the Government should
assist the co. to prospect for new ore-bodies
was surely not prompted by the directors;
it would be incredible that the management
of a mining venture which has distributed
almost millions in divs. should in the
end seek State charity to search for payable
mill-feed.
Old records reveal that the M'oonta mines
gave £5,396.146 of bar copper from. 1889 to
the time of their amalgamation with Wal-
laroo and paid divs. of £1.168,000. Wal-
laroo had supplied £2,229,096 of copper and
earned profits of £430,254. Since amalga-
mation the combined shows from 11,392,802
tons of dressed ore have won 330,547 tons
copper worth £12.340,000, and paid
£2,638,000 of divs. From first to last the
two groups have distributed to shareholders
£4,236,254 from copper sold for £19.965,268,
so that a tidy balance went to labor, and
into plant, fuel, mine supplies and realisa-
tion costs. Since 1891 the best div. years
were 1906-07 when, with copper at more
than £B6 a ton, 10s. was disbursed in one
year and 17s. 6d. the next, with a humble 2s.
following in 1908. Two 10s. were paid in
both 1917 add 1918, and 15s. in 1916, when
copper was well over £llO.
The Lloyd George, Gibraltar (W.A.),
supplies results to June 30 in balance-sheet
form. During the year 13,524 tons yielded
by amalgamation 63700 z. worth £25,766,
while the cyanide plant treated 5725 tons of
sands and slimes for a recovery of 4950 z.
worth £lBOO. Working account showed a
credit of £2458, but Profit and Loss was
£3902 on the wrong side. The co.’s worst
millstone is the £7401 shown on loan
account; the lenders presumably are asso-
ciated with Prescott’s, Ltd., of Sydney,
where the directorate has its headquarters.
An “option” over a block of shares is still
in abeyance; at the end of September the
managing-director had the right to take up
10,000 contribs. at 55., but the market had
a sick appearance at the time, and the con-
tract is still in the air. No doubt the manag-
ing director is wild with himself for refusing
15s. for the scrip when Adelaide pushed the
shares to that figure about the middle of
this year. In his mine report, Alfred Forbes
stresses the “puzzling nature of this highly
irregular and unusual ore deposit” when re-
ferring to the southerly workings. Inciden-
tally, too, he admits that in this freak, which
has “a flat underlay to the westward instead
of the normal easterly underlay shown above
No. 1 level,” lies the future of the mine, as
at present visible. The stopes above No. 1
level north are about depleted, and in No. 2
north drive 50ft. of crosscutting and 65ft. of
driving on lode material found nothing better
than 2dwt. stuff. The 10-liead battery, which
replaced the old Huntingdon in May, is a
capable plant, treating from 80 to 100 tons
in 24 hours. If the disturbed country in the
south workings could be replaced by more
orderly strata, the management would have
less to think about at night.

Boulder Perseverance is at present West-
ralia’s best mine. This year the “Percy”
has yielded bullion worth £170.000 from
40,000 tons. Gt. Boulder (£220,000), Ivan-
hoc (£200,000) and Golden Horseshoe
(£174,000) beat it in gold production, but
they have had to treat about twice the ton-
nage to do so.

The newest “oil” find in Westralia petered
out when the Mines Department scrutiny
pronounced the “seepage” a mixture of kero-
sene and soapsuds or some kindred concoc-
tion “of an artificial nature.” Interested
parties were slick enough while the hectic
flush lasted. One Sydney co. promoter re-
ceived an urgent telegram offering an option
over an “adjoining lease,” the terms being
£5OO by telegraph and £5OOO in a month.
* * * #
Mararoa (W.A.) announces that its option
on the Emu leases at Reidy’s, near Cue, is
a free one, and that prospects are bright.
That’s one side of the picture. The general
belief is that the property contains only a
small ore deposit which has already been
investigated and turned down by well-known
mining men.
* * * *
Big Ben Development syndicate, Gunda-
gai (N.S.W.), has broken the silence again.
This time it announces that more ore would
have been available for the battery but for
the bad weather. “In the tunnel the ore-
channel was met at 127 ft.” Just at this
interesting stage the information under that
head evaporates. “The battery is running
two shifts on good ore, and the first 200 tons
should be cleaned up at the end of the
month.” Jusso. This threat has been held
over the heads of shareholders for about four
months, and the only outcome has been the
regular call of 10s. a month. The fortitude
of scrip-holders is admirable.

“Sol”: An impression gains ground that
Itawang tin (F.M.S.) has been the victim of
a boosting campaign. No. 2 run of the 14in.
electric plant extended over nine weeks, and
a mere £B2O profit resulted with tin well over
£2OO. The yield of 38 tons from 175,000 yd.
was mediocre enough for anything, and in-
quirers are told that all the rich ground is
ahead. It would need to be; but folk wlio
dabble in tin concerns are becoming just
a little tired of this familiar story. The
property was originally estimated at36o work-
able acres out of 600, which were expected
to yield I.lBlb. per yd. from 23,500,000 yd.
From April 1 to June 11 this year the steam
plant produced 80.6401 b. from 90,000 yd., with
later results of 53.7601 b. from 64,000 yd., and
47,0401 b. from 54,000 yd. The electric plant
shows up worse, its first run giving 80,6401 b.
from 110.000 yd. and its second 85,1201 b. from
175,000 yd. Estimates of profits issued last
year commenced with 15 p.c. with tin at
£165, went to 25 p.c. with tin at £lB5, and
30 p.c. at £2OO. Last January, with tin
at £lB5, shares reached 3s. 3d., huge parcels
being placed on the Sydney market. Later
on, however, the market was consistently
forced down, despite a bull market in tin.
and nowadays, with tin well over £2OO, the
shares are rickctty below the par rate of
2s. 4d., having touched 2s. Id. Malayan
holders have been selling consistently, but
the question arises whether rhe stampede
there has not been the repercussion of Syd-
ney market operations.
* * * *
Though the glories of Walhalla (Vic.)
have faded, the locality still has a charm for
the co.-promoter. The latest float is the
Long Tunnel South, which has acquired 50
acres. The ridge to be exploited lies to the
west of Cohen’s, a proved dyke and reef run-
ning parallel for the full length of the lease.
Down to 100 ft. 200 tons have been gouged
out and crushed for oOOoz. of gold, and
values, according to the prospectus, are still
underfoot. A suggested tunnel into the hill-
side is calculated to give 400 ft. of backs.
The latest “oil seepage” is reported to
have been found hidden in the bush of the
Glenelg River. Charlton Dod and “Bux”
Lyne are the examining scientists for the
South Aus. Oil Wells, which seems to have
got there first. They have identified the
rare bird. In the market it is told that the
seep is moved at times to give out a gallon,
and at others a teaspoonful, and market
prices pulsate accordingly. It is a wonder
that it has kept out of sight during these
long years of fishing for jewfisli in the
stretches of the beautiful Glenelg. Dod and
Lyne announce that their sample is a dark,
crude oil of fair density. A bore has been
sunk about six miles away, and the struc-
ture is declared to be favorable, just as Base-
dow said it was farther along the coast at
Robe. Government Geologist Baragwanath
and his staff are to examine the find.

Queensland Mines Minister Jones’s de-
cision that leases shall not exceed 10 acres on
the new Mount Isa silver-lead field has
stirred up a hornet’s-nest among the miners
who got in early on 15 acres, while it has
not pleased the ultra-“reds” of Cloncurry,
who are barracking for small claims. The
question at present is, who is to get the
extra five acres of existing leases, particu-
larly on the richest crops? The decision is
obviously intended to give gougers a good
run, but in the end it may prejudice develop-
ment of much ground where values will not
be high. Options have already been secured
over certain leases and claims, particularly
on the Mount Isa and Black Star lodes, so
the gouger regime may not last long. All
the latest reports continue optimistic, and
the field is considered of such importance
that the Mines Department is moving to have
a detailed geological examination made of
the surrounding country.

Queensland’s northern tinfields are
afflicted by drought, and crushing is held
up. Herberton and Stannary Hills have
both felt the pinch. The Arbouin, on the
latter field, blossomed out last crushing with
200 tons going 4 p.c. after turning out 24 p.c.
regularly of late. As this mine lias been the
leading producer the rise is noteworthy, and it
is expected to continue, as some of the pre-
sent faces bulk 5 p.c. to 6 p.c. The Great
Northern has likewise improved; the last
crushing topped 14 p.c., and the mine looks
well.

Quartz from the big 15ft. formation at
460 ft. in the Wellington bore, Charters
Towers, has been assayed, but wont only be-
tween 2dwt. and 3dwt. There w-ere 17in. of
quartz where the drill hit the lode, and now
the question is whether it is worth another
hole in case the shoot has been missed. The
belief that it is the Moonstone-Perseverance
lode weighs against another bore, because in
that quarter it has been very barren gener-
ally. The South East Day Dawn got no-
thing thereabouts in past years.
* * * *
Lander Oil is ready to start its first pros-
pecting hole at Orallo (Q.). A w r ater-bore
is down 250 ft., and tapped supplies with
which to carry on operations. The Roma gas
strata should be passed through at under
2000 ft. Below r that lies the land of promise.
* * * *
George Blakoe, who has been in and out
of two or three tin-shows on the Kangaroo
Hills in the last couple of years, appears to
be on his best proposition at present in the
Golden Horseshoe. This is a chlorite lode
shewing tin-stone freely down to a depth of
35ft., and IS tons going about 25 p.c. have
come out so far. The lode varies up to lain.,
and appears to have a chance of developing
into something good.
The coal seams at Injune Creek, near
Roma (Q.), have had a further test by
owner Haenke, who is also interested in
Balgowan and Rhondda collieries. A pros-
pecting shaft has proved three seams: the
top one is 2ft. sin. thick, 37ft. lower down
is another going 34ft., and 70ft. deeper a
4ft. seam. Levels have been taken for a
tunnel and a siding, and it is proposed to
put the work in hand at an early date.
Periodically Herberton (N.Q.) comes to
light with something out of the way in tin
lodes. The latest is Bassi and O’Malley s
Scorpion claim, on the western side of the
main tin-belt. After patient and systematic
prospecting Bassi has opened up a lode for
16ft., and 7ft. dowm it is reported to be 6ft.
wide and to bulk 1 ( p.c. tin.
Queensland Mines Minister Alf .Tones has
been casting doubt on the value of the dia-
mond drill for prospecting gold reefs. In
Westralia notable instances of the drill locat-
ing a reef are on record, the latest being in
1916, when Tom Duff, of Edna May Deeps,
located the continuation of the Edna May
reef in the Deeps lease at 498 ft. This gave
the Deeps heart to go on with development,
and at the same time determined the life of
the Edna May, which market theorists had
put down at about 800 ft.
The fluor lode near Almaden looks much
the best yet unearthed in Queensland. The
B. H. Prop, is keenly interested and has had
an official on the spot sizing it up. The
lode is very pure and for size and prospects
easily beats Emuford, where the co. for-
merly got its Queensland fluorspar.

“Oka”: The remarks of “Green Seas”
about “Pelorus Jack” (B. 11/10/’23) give
me a chance of adding something of my own
to what has already appeared about the
famous fish with the queer habit of charging
out of the cove at French Pass and, after
doing the Gaby Glide at the bows, dropping
back and resting its tail on the stem of the
vessel. This programme he would vary by
diving to port and under the ship, coming up
amidships on the starboard side. When Jack
disappeared it was generally supposed that
some, squareheads, who were around the coast
in whaling vessels, had rubbed him out, acci-
dentally or otherwise. But there are at least
two seafaring men who know differently.

ping Co.; the other is myself. We were
aboard one of that company’s vessels, on the
way from New Plymouth to Wellington,
some 12 months after Jack disappeared, and
at a point about 200 miles from French Pass
we saw a fish break at the bows and a little
later appear on the starboard side. Both of us
said “Pelorus Jack!” simultaneously. After
that I saw the fish in much the same place
regularly for over eight months. And he
wasn’t a figment or a fantod, for my ony
drink on those trips was pure water tiom

“Hamer” : How’s this for a model wife ?
Seventeen years ago there disappeared from
the suburban home of a Sydney couple a
servant-girl who had obvious reasons tor
leaving. A couple of months later an infant
was found on the doorstep. After a fruitless
effort to find the mother, the couple, who are
childless, adopted the waif. The other day
the real mother turned up to claim her oil-
spring. She explained that her first husband
was dead ; her second was the father ot the
infant which she had left on the doorstep .
hence her desire to claim her long-abandoned
daughter. She had other children, however,
and was induced to waive her claim. But
the amazement of the child’s foster-mother at
the story was responsible for a queer revela-
tion : the gentle lady had for nearly 17 years
imagined that her husband was the father ot
the child, and had never reproached him
with as much as a word.
“Wealsman”: The Chief Justice of Tas-
mania has just delivered a useful bit of law
to his fellow-citizens by ruling that a man
who witnesses the signature of the testator to
a will under which the witness’s wife is a
beneficiary thereby cuts the lady clean out of
her legacy. In the case under notice two
sisters, both married, were to share equally
in their brother’s estate. But one of them
claimed the lot, on the ground that the hus-
band of her dear sister had witnessed the
will. She won, and takes everything. The
Chief Justice called the Law the same old
ass by saying it was hard on the disinherited
sister that she should have to suffer by
reason of the fact that her brother was suffi-
ciently friendly Avith her husband to ask him
to witness his testament; but there was no
help for it, though it was all an obvious acci-
dent. The will was home-made, and, as
usual, nobody knew it was loaded. The fool
section in the local Wills Act reads (Sec.
15) :
And be it further enacted that if any person shall
attest the execution of any will to whom or to
whose wife or husband any beneficial devise, legacy.,
estate interest, gift or appointment, of or affecting
any real or personal estate (other than and except
charges and directions for the payment of any debt
or debts), shall, be thereby given or made, such
devise, etc., shall, so far only as concerns such per-
son attesting the execution of such will, or the
wife or husband of such person, or any person claim-
ing under such person or wife or husband, be utterly
null and void.
So a man who marries a prospective heiress
cannot be too careful.

before I was there in
’6B. When I was sent
on my mission by the
Surveyor-General I was
supplied by the office
with a map showing
everything in the lo-
cality that was then
known. This map
showed a traverse of a
road from the old Main
Western-road at Mt.
York, following the
divide between the
waters of the Colo and
the Grose, passing over
Mt. Tomah and con-
tinuing towards Rich-
mond. 1 have no doubt
that this road, known
as “Bell’s Line” and
used as a stock route
until superseded by the
railway, is the traverse
referred to by “The
Oldest,” but it does
not go within several
miles of Mt. Wilson.
My work was connected
with the above by a
traverse three or four
miles in length, form-
ing the present road of
access. The ridge form-
ing Mt. Wilson and Mt.
Irvine is plainly to be
seen from Bell’s Line,
and might very well
have been sketched in
roughly by Govett, or
whoever made the
traverse. But there
was nothing to take
him into it; indeed
it would merely have
led him into a cul-de-
sac.
“Bad Australian”: “In me young days,”
Paddy O’Heliir told me, “I was a blue-wather
sailor, an’ things wint well enough until I
shipped outa Puget Sound f’r Milburn’ wid
a rampagin’, roarin’, curse-o’-God, blue-nose
skipper. Be th’ hokey, that thrip gave me
a bellyfull an’ more av sayfarin’; so as soon
as we med Sandridge I shlipped me cable an

“Well, what do you think?”

her clatther that I med off to Milburn to

“Azac” : A propos German corpse factories,
I think the fiction owed its growth, if not its
origin, to the different meanings assignable
to the German word “korper,” which can
mean corpse or carcase. In 1!)17 many Eng-
lish papers asserted that dead Fritzes were
being boiled down. The Times, to prove its
assertion, quoted the following translation of
a German Army order :
It has been necessary once more to lay stress on
the fact that, when corpses are being sent to the
corpse utilisation establishments, particulars as to
the unit, date of death, illness and information as to
contagious diseases, if any, are to be furnished at
the same time.
The translation reads very differently when
the w r ord “carcase” is substituted tor
“corpse” ; and the substitution is quite per-
missible, as the German word used in the
army order was “korper.”
“Whitehall” on some impending changes:
Sydney’s greatest exodus of struggling hash-house
keepers, seedy old gentlemen and callow boy-lodgers
will occur shortly when Alberto-terrace, Darlinghurst,
is handed over to the house-breakers. For the best
part of a half-century it has been going- down hill in
the social sense. Like the vanishing terrace at the
southern end of Hyde Park, which first housed nota-
bilities like Alfred Stephen and the original Win-
deyer, then became a haunt of doctors, and finally
sank to genteel seediness, Alberto-terrace was de-
signed after a common London model. There are
thousands of such flat-faced aggregations in every
quarter of the great city. Utterly unsuited to Aus-
tralian conditions, the only marvel is that some of
them still remain—notably in the once-fashionable
“Rocks” district. The Darlinghurst deal is another
triumph for unearned increment. It was made pos-
sible by the huge sums that have been poured out on
the widening of William-street; for now William-
street may not continue to be a mere shoot through
which the moneyed classes are fired on their journey
to the city and home again. Thirty years ago most of
London’s Brompton-road was as unfashionable as
William-street is. The rise of Harrod’s lifted it un,
and it is now a smart promenade and a tremendously-
valuable shopping and flat-dwelling centre. If this
happens to William-street—and there are indications
that it is going to —then Potts Point should bloom
again into the expensive exotic it was in the middle
of last century.
“Fleet Street” (Bond.) : That Miss Lily
Butler who got herself taken so seriously at
Government Houses and elsewhere in Aus-
tralia a few months ago, is now providing
entertainment for the
Australian “colony” —
entertainment mixed,
however, with some
exasperation. She has
a genius for getting
interviewed; and from
the published stories
one gathers that you
must cling tight to
your ship in an Aus-
tralian port or chance
being eaten. Of course,
Miss Butler decided to
take the risk. “She
went right up into the
Never Never Land, to
places where no other
white woman had been
before”; she got so
close to the cannibals
that “I could see them
in the distance, and I
must admit I was par-
ticularly anxious that
I should not figure on
their menu”; and at
an overland telegraph
station “I could see
the natives who two
years before had eaten
the operators.” They
always take the i r
first-born roasted, it
seems : it pleases thei r
gods and brings luck
to the rest of the
family. What ought
to be done with people
like Miss Lily Butler
it is hard to say. A
mere rebuke would be
quite ineffectual. So
long as there is adver-
tisement to be got,
Miss Butler will be at
the early doors. But,
seeing that the Gov-
ernments are in the
thick of an immigra-
tion propaganda, it does look as if Australia
House might well take some notice of the
lady’s grotesque caricatures.
* * * *
“G.T.”: Re “Ashmead” on great girls in
the bush (B. 18/10/’23). Fifty years ago
a young gin, stark naked, with a billycan
full of water, left the Balonne River at
Mooraby (Q.) to find a young fellow lost
out in the dry country. Two days later they
were both back on the river, but the gin was
dead. I was the young fellow, and the pity
is I haven’t the ability to write an adequate
eulogy of one of the bravest hearts that ever
beat in a human breast.

“Centurion”: “Hambone” is right in Ms
contention (B. 25/10/’23) that the German
saw-edged bayonet, of which so much fuss
was made, was only issued to pioneers and
sappers for emergency sawing, etc. But the
combination weapon was not peculiar to the

sword-bayonet form it was once on issue to

saw many of them in Australia in days gone
by. and no doubt the armorer’s stores still

CARROTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Brick-red, heaped in a hawker’s cart,
With green bruised crests and the earthy smell
They carry with them of the loamy nests
In market-gardens that knew them well,
They hold the orange of sun-baked walls,
Green of jades in a Chinese jar ;
And a golden sun and a silver rain
Have shaped them into the wares they are.
Why do I think of mulberry-trees
Stained in the crimson splash of fruits,
A wooden swing with a creaking rope
That in and out of the shadow shoots,
Silkworms nibbling a crinkled leaf —
Feeding up, that we may despoil—
And over there by the garden fence
Carrot-tops in the crumbling soil?
A homely dream with a taste of youth—
Youth only tastes of its carrots raw!
But I heard the creak of that lazy swing
When carrot-tops in a cart I saw.
I stand with my feet on the earth to-day.
Did the old tree die? Did the new rope break?
I don’t like carrots, but, hawker —here!
I’ll buy a bunch for a lost youth’s sake!

“Randolph Rentless”: A new tabernacle,
of which the foundation-stone was laid the
other day at Newtown (Sydney), attests the
growth of Mormonism in Australia, although,
of course, the queer marriage doctrines most
popularly associated with the faith are not
mentioned. The sect has, it is alleged, 60,000
missionaries scattered about the world ; but:
this army of bagmen, paid originally from
headquarters, nowadays pays for itself, since
the adherents they secure are required to
supply funds for carrying on the work. The
tithe is a rigorously enforced article of Mor-
mon belief. The Maori is said to be about
the readiest convert —as far back as 20 years
ago Mormonism was practically the accepted
faith of Hori and Henare in Gisborne ana
some of the adjacent districts.
* * * *
A native tells more about the ’Loo: —
After the grant was made to Commissary Palmer
it was known as “The Farm,” and the hundred
acres were enclosed. A wall was built running
from the bay to the lower edge of Cook
Park; thence a ditch and hedge of furze ran up
Oxford-street as far as Darlinghurst Gaol, where it
turned again towards the bay. The cottage in
which the Palmer family lived was built close to
where the Bank of N.S.W. now stands in William-
street. Several of the Palmers were buried in a
vault which was dug at the corner of William and
Woolloomooloo streets, but the remains were subse-
quently removed. I doubt whether the Riley , family
bought the property direct from the Palmers, as the
farm was occupied by several people in the interim.
Riley, by the way, husband of the purchaser, com-
mitted suicide there.
“Zao” : Talking of record-breaking in the
line of infant-production. Certain districts
and streets seem to have a leaning that way.
When I lived in—well, never mind where
(it’s no good scaring house-hunters), the
top of the thoroughfare led off with a young
Australian. Three days later, two doors
along, the Stork shot twins down the chim-
ney. The following week the benevolent
fowl perched upon a roof-tree with a consign
merit of triplets. It was then that a small-
boy chum confided to me the foreboding
which filled his youthful soul. “There’s a
new ’un up at Gill’s and Jones’s have got
two, and round at Sim’s there’s three—it’s
coming up the street.” It certainly seemed
to me that it was, and gathering force as it
approached. I’m not superstitious, but—-
anyway, I never did believe in living in the
same place all your life.
“The Rumpus”: Mention of “pullers” by
“Schnorrcr” (B. 11/10/’23) recalls an ex-

“If I marry the doctor I can he ill for nothing.”
“Why not marry the parson, sweetest, and he good for

pcrience of an old friend of mine. He was
standing in front of a tailor’s shop in Mel-
bourne, waiting until I returned from a
chemist’s across the street, when an insinuat-
ing person gently drew him away with
“Come inside, sir; we have a wonderful
variety of suiting material to choose from.”
Bolts of different cloths were heaved on to
the counter, and cards of samples pushed
into his hands. “But,” he began to protest
feebly, “I can’t see” “You will in a
moment,” interrupted the “puller,” beckon-
ing another conspirator. “Air. Snips, this
gent, can’t see the advantage of purchasing
his new suit here. Just show him our special-

value low-price goods and convince liim.”
I poked my nose in the shop as my poor old
friend again entered his protest. “But I tell
you I can’t see,” he said earnestly; “I’m
blind !”
* * * *
“Kowsara”: Commandeering a 14ft.
“flattie,” and with no chart but a map torn
from a school atlas, three young men who had
been at the Townsville (N.Q.) unemployed
camp set sail in the early hours of the
morning for Papua, on the offchance of find-
ing jobs more plentiful there than in the
section of Australia they were leaving. Two
kerosene tins of water and the freshly-killed
carcase of a goat comprised the com-
missariat. They chose a bad day for their
enterprise. Saturday is sailing day for the
local club, and before noon the theft of the
racing flattie was discovered. The police
motor-launch was soon in pursuit, and be-
fore many hours it returned to town with
the adventurous trio in tow. They reckoned
they’d had a fighting chance of pulling
through, and they preferred it, anyway, to
police rations. Of course they knew they
were “pinching” the boat: but they swear
the owner wouldn’t have been the loser if
they had got to New Guinea.
“Caveman” on deep-water superstitions:—
Many skippers of deep-sea ships still believe that
there are plenty of days in the week better than
Friday for sailing, and set their
plans accordingly. On closing
the hatches the capsizing of a
cover is almost a form of man-
slaughter. Should the wind fail,
or come from the wrong quarter,
a sheath-knife stuck in the fore-
mast, on the side from which wind
is desired, is sure to mend mat-
ters. Another remedy for lack of
motive power is a form of bribery.
I saw the old man come on deck
one evening, look round at the
glassy sea and empty sky, and then
pitch a penny over the side. He
was a stolid old chap, too, and
level-headed. AVhen I broached
the incident in the fo’c’s’le all
hands agreed solemnly that they
had never known such action to
fail. Spilling salt is always an
unfortunate occurrence. When a
seaman dies the old man sells his
effects, at auction among the crew.
But the buyers know better than to
wear the clothes on the same
voyage. Many sailing-ships even
now carry a shark’s tail nailed on
the end of the jibboom. Some
member of the crew may fall over-
board during the voyage, but as long as the tail’s
aloft he won’t he attacked by any tiger of the sea
that may be prowling about.
“Lexite”: Everyone should be careful
about jumping on a moving train, but for
a man with a Past to do it is a challenge to
the Fates. A citizen who comes in this cat-
egory fell between the train and the platform
not long ago, and was picked up uninjured.
There his good luck ended. He was prose-
cuted for an offence against the railway by-
laws, and the publicity given to the case
led to the offender being sued immediately
after on a long-outstanding judgment debt.
He had just cleared up that mess when an
inquiry came from Brisbane as to whether
the man mentioned in the newspaper report
resembled a vanished husband (photo en-
closed) who had deserted a wife in Brisbane
seven y. -rs before. He did; and then the
Brisbani police remembered that the same
man was wanted for embezzlement and
escape from custody. Nothing else has turned
up yet, but he’s busy digging over his years
to try to discover what might.
“Hobnobster” : I nominate the
Assyrian as the champion liar. I
was at the Grafton (N.S.W.)
Show recently, and in a lavatory
saw an altercation between two of
them which ended in one being
chopped about with a knife. The
incident lasted only a few seconds,
and I was the only eye-witness. I
had almost dismissed the matter
from my mind when I received a
subpoena calling on me to give evi-
dence in an assault case. As the
hearing progressed I found that
one side had 10 witnesses who saw
the affair from beginning to end,
and the other 11, including myself.
“Sturt”: In the view of the Syd-
ney and Melbourne litigant law
costs are amazingly moderate in
South Aus.; nevertheless the recent
arbitration over a resumption of
wharves, mostly on the Port (Adel-
aide! river, meant some plums for
the profession. A pressing question
put to Barwell in the Assembly
brought out that the Government
paid £16,000 to its own counsel and
£13,000 as costs to the other side.
The case was 18 days before the
Supreme Court and 116 before the
arbitrators. While the public was
looking dubiously at the figures
someone jumped in with an assur-
ance that there was more to cheer
than to cry over, as the co. owning
the wharves was awarded only
£354.000, and had claimed just half
a million more than that. It was
a case where the optimist sug-
gests that the mackerel was well
worth the million-odd “sprats.”
* * -jf-
Ettie A. Rout's kick :
The Daily Sketch (Lond.) continues the story of
Miss Lily Butler, C.8.E., the Australian explorer.
The latest heading is “Loneliest Woman in the
World —London Girl Who Lost Her Fiance in the
War Found Her Ideal in a Black Man and Married
Him.” The Digger who died was evidently very
lucky. His intended, according to Miss Lily,
“drifted up country as cook on the backbl'ock
stations” ; met a black man, declared him to be her
“ideal,” and “marry him she did, in native fashion”
—Miss Lily being an unmarried lady does not go
into details. She went to one of Kidman’s stations
—“a country worse than the Sahara, barren, desolate
and frightfully h0t.... not a blade of grass or a
tree.” And when the car broke down “the relief
was a buggy drawn by half a dozen horses with a
half-paralysed, nearly-blind old man to drive
them. He brought me to the hut of some telegraph
workers, but how we ever survived that mad ride in
the dark I don’t know.” And worse was to follow:
“From the window of my shack I saw a camp Are,
and around it a crowd of naked aborigines. These
were the men who only a few years ago were canni-
bals, and I was terribly frightened.” “But ‘Bless
you,’ said the telegraph man, ‘they are all right.
Why, they'd eat canary-seed out of your hand.’ ”
“All the same, I was not so sure,” adds Miss Lily.
Of course —she wasn’t going to give up her cannibals
for a handful of canary-seed! And the grand finale:
“And now, after ‘humping my bluey,’ as the Aus-
tralians say of the traveller in the waste lands, after
four years I’m back home to tell people that for
those who don’t mind solitude and work there is a
great opening in Australia.” There is need fer a
law in Australia that all Patriotic Females bo
muzzled before they escape to England to run self-
glorification geysers calculated to ruin the prospects
of sensible migration for many a long year.
**. * *
“Delver”: The excavators working at the
corner of Barrack and George streets, where
the Commercial Banking (Company of Syd-
ney is re-building, have a better chance of
dropping across an old cow-bell or wooden
milk-pail than of finding a bag of gold. The
spot was originally occupied by a dairy, pro-
bably the first in Australia. The proprietor,
a woman, was allowed to fence off a block
of land running back approximately as far as
York-street. She remained there from about
1810 to 1815, when the George-street Bar-
racks were built on this site, and the sergeant-
major’s bellow replaced the lowing of the
milkers. It was not until the late ’forties
that the swaddies were shifted to Padding-
ton. At the time of the military removal the
Commercial Bank occupied premises on the
post-office side of George-street, down to-
wards King-street.
“Azrim”: The casual Australian again.
This morning, in the park near my home, a
tyke deposited a set of grinders at my feet.
Shortly afterwards a man shambled along,
still heavy-eyed from the previous evening.
“You haven’t seen a set of teeth about here,
have you?” he called. “Lost ’em last night.”
I indicated the gnashing apparatus on the
grass. He picked them up and examined
them. “They look like ’em,” he, said, and
before I could stop him he had crammed
them into his-mouth and was working his
jaws furiously. “Them's them.” he said,
and with a nod he and the molars started
down the path.

Dear Girl, your anger is misplaced ;

The kiss I stole I would return;
Or keep it, dear, as treasure lent,
With interest at cent, per cent.

For that your bright lips are to blame—-

From one who feels his fault no shame,
But as a churl himself would view
To plead excuse for kissing you !

One of its most picturesque figures disap-
peared from Australian journalism with the
death, on Monday, of W. F. Corbett, who for
37 years had been writing on -athletics in
Sydney, mostly for the Referee and its
allied papers. He had drifted into press work
from the telegraph operating room. His own
pile of trophies won at sculling, swimming
and bowling was formidable ; but it was as
a boxing writer that he made a reputation
which held good in America and England as
well as here. Corbett’s knowledge of the
craft, history and personalia of the ring was
a thing to wonder at. Fie was 67 at the
end, but he retained a remarkably youthful
spirit, and although he easily held the record
as a quantity producer of “copy.” he was,
up till his last illness, just as keen about
every little par. as the youngest cub keyed
up by the glamor of seeing himself in print.
J. S. T. McGowen will be the first N.S.W.
Premier to have a memorial erected as a
tribute to his purely religious services. It
is to be a monument at St. Paul’s Church,
Redfern, where the old Labor leader was
Sunday-school superintendent for long years,
and inside it a casket will contain some tools
he used as a boilermaker and other memen-
toes. McGowen’s father was also attached
to St. Paul’s Church, though up till 1867
lie was a publican in Victoria.
A. U. Alcoek, whose method of defrosting
frozen meat by electricity is interesting
British importers, is a son of the Vic. manu-
facturer whose memory is kept green on a
thousand billiard-tables. When about half
bis present age Alcock fils took an invention
to London, but was forestalled by a foreigner
who chanced to have been working on a
similar idea. He looks like having better
luck with his defrosting process.
The resignation of H. J. Baker as Chair-
man of the Vic. H.C.L. Commission came as
a godsend to the evening papers, which had
little else to splash on that day. Baker had
come to the conclusion that with a scope so
narrow and only four or five months for the
job the Commission couldn’t do anything
effective; and there was no undertaking that
its recommendations would be enforced, any-
how. Mrs. Glencross, No. 3 on the Com-
mission (fee, £lO a week), sniffed loudly,
but Reseigh. No. 2 member, was tactfully
taciturn. Lawson has now filled the vacancy
with E. C. W. Kelly, a lawyer who lectures
on politicial economy at the ’Varsity. And
still nobody expects anything.
Melbourne and Ballarat High Schools are
losing their heads —Hocking and Refshaugc
—at the end of the year. Hocking was
allotted by Tate the seemingly impossible
task of making co-education successful for
students between 14 and 19 in a ricketty old
building, planned, when Vic. was in swad-
dling clothes, for a model State school and
Education Department combined. He took
hold, and turned out some of the State’s
brightest boys and girls. Retiring on a
pension of £5OO, he goes to Britain next year.
Refshauge, who is nearly as famous in Bal-
larat, is taking to the land.
Jack Goss, of Wanganui, who won the
amateur golf championship of Maoriland this
year by defeating veteran Arthur Duncan,
went away to the Big War with the
Enzeds, and came back an eye short. Still,
he can see as much with one as most golfers
can with two.
Little Lewis Cohen, retiring from the
Adelaide mayoralty after his ninth year of
it. doesn’t mean to leave the City Council,
which he first entered in 1886. (He has had
three years as councillor and 12 as aider-
man.) The retiring aldermen this year are
Moulden and Isaacs, and as they have always
backed him loyally Cohen won’t oppose them,
but goes for a councillor’s seat. There being
no apparent anxiety to climb into the
mayoral chair among those who have not
been in it, Glover is going to have another
term.
Missing his first Melbourne Cup for more
than 30 years, Dr. Grey Thompson, Govern-
ment Medical-officer at Launceston —he
passed out a few days ago. He had many
interests beyond doctoring—was chairman
of the Mt. Bischoff Co. and had a finger in
most of the other mining pies in the Speck.
N. S. Wales lost its most ancient tooth-
puller when Moses Emanuel died last week
aged 85. The old chap was better known
as a musician and singer than as a dentist,
although he had a big business in Wynyard-
square. Besides lending a fine baritone voice
to many concerts, he had dabbled in the
managerial pool of opera production. When
“Lucia di Lammermoor” was staged for the
first time at Melbourne Opera House, it was
his sister, Carrie Emanuel, who played the
name-part, and brother Moses financed the
production. He spent nearly all his life in
Australia ; he was only four when his father,
a musician, settled in Ballarat.
The first Australian to sit in the House of
Commons was barrister T. Chisholm Anstey,
a native of Van Diemen’s Land, who, at the
1547 election, was returned for Youghal as an
Irish Nationalist, his sponsor being Charles
Gavan Duffy. The defeated candidate was
the Hon. Charles P'onsonby. Anstey sat in

Clerk of Bendigo,
who is on the

one Parliament,
and at next elec-
tion Isaac Butt
captured the seat.
One of the Ansteys
was Sec. for Lands
and Works in the
first Ministry in
the Speck under
responsible gov-
ernment, the head
of the team being
Col. Champ, after-
wards Inspector-
General of the
Penal Department
in Vic.
Charlie Bray, who died at Temora
(N.S.W.) a few days ago at 95, worked a
puddling plant on the old Lambing Flat
diggings, and was an eye-witness of the anti-
Chinese riots which were the genesis of the
White Australia policy. When Ben Hall
and his gang tried to stick up the gold escort
from the Flat Bray was one of those whom
they made prisoners on the road just before
the escort was due. No harm came to him,
and the bushranger' was always something
of a hero in his eyes after that.
T. F. Clieeseman, Curator of the Auck-
land (M.L.) Museum for half a century,
lived to see plans out and £150,000 in hand
for a £200,000 War Memorial Museum. His
own particular line was botany, and on
Maoriland flora his word carried weight in
the world. The Linnsean Society gave him
its gold medal, and he had the Hector Medal,
the highest honor conferable by his own insti-
tute. He could not have got much else be-
yond satisfaction out of his life-long devotion
to Maori land’s trees and plants, for the
material rewards of pure science- over there
would be rejected with derision if offered to
a navvy or a fireman.
The impending retirement of jV.S.W. Chief
Justice Cullen brings Shand, Iv.C., into dis-
cussion again. Shand is only 58, and would
thus have a good way to go before he
touches 70, which means retirement. Though
he has been deaf to suggestions of a minor
Judgeship, the Chiefs job may appeal to him.
Reverting to the system of promoting some-
body trained in the gaols, the Vic. Ministry
has decided to make Barclay, Governor of
Melbourne Gaol, liead-man at Pentridge in
succession to Conder. The same thing was
done in the Police Department after the
comet-like careers of Steward and Gellibrand.
Australia is to be ransacked for a suitable
Penal Inspector-General—at £750 or £BOO.
Australia has too many Governors for the
P. and T. Department to remember. When
the Stradbrokes returned from the Fog a
few weeks ago, a Vic. legal dignitary des-
patched to Perth a congratulatory telegram.
The wire was addressed to the wrong boat:
and the P. and T. Department, carrying out
the regulations to the last full-stop, reported
the missive as undelivered. Storming over
the ’phone to a Commonwealth official in
Melbourne, the indignant sender declared,
“But surely everybody here knows Lord
Stradbroke!” The G.P.O. admitted that
might be so. “But you can’t expect every-
body to know him in West Australia,” he
added.
There were originally five houses in Lyons-
terrace, the 80-odd-years-old Sydney pre-
mises which are in the knacker’s hands.
Chief Justice Stephen, at the Elizabeth-
street end, had for next-door neighbor Dr.
Wallace, one of Sydney’s leading medicoes of
the period. For nearly 60 years the terrace
was patronised by medical men till it was
regarded as the Harley-street of Sydney.
Among them were Dr. G. Marshall, father
of the present Macquarie-street physician,
Hamilton Marshall; Dr. J. Moffitt, father
of the senior medical-officer of Ivenmore Men-
tal Hospital; Dr. Byrne, dentist; Dr.
Andrew Brady, patriarch of Macquarie-
street; and Dr. W. Mac Murray. The late
Herbert Maitland was one of the last doctors
to take down his plate from the terrace rail-
ings.
Another old hand to pass out recently was
-Tames Shannon (88). He came from Argyle-
sbire as a lad, tried his luck on the goldfields
of Vic. and Maoriland, subsequently took up
country in the Riverina (N.S.W.), and later
was manager of the Belmont Park estate for
his brother-in-law, Major Philip Charley.
S. Aus. is having a brisk controversy over
the appointment of Julius, from Tasmania,
to the job of Conservator of Forests. Cor-
bin, of the ’Varsity, is the local tree-autho-
rity, and was sounded by the Public Service-
Commissioner ; but the Government went be-
hind the Commissioner and outside the State.
Barwell says the local man has the academic
attainments but not the administrative capa-
city.
Australian sculptor C. Web Gilbert is to
be represented in S. Aus. by a bronze statue
commemorating the fallen soldiers of the
suburban district of Burnside. It will be
a striking figure of an Australian soldier in
action, and is to be erected at Rose Park
in the vicinity of the soldiers’ memorial
avenues. Fred Johns has been the moving
spirit as sec. of the memorial.
“Sclinorrer”: Died recently in Brussels,
one of the religions heroes of the war—
Armand Bloch. Chief Rabbi of Belgium for
32 years. He refused to sign an undertaking
to obey the orders of the Germans, and he
preached a sermon during the 1916 Pass-
over in which he declared that “people who
do not demand liberty and who resign them-
selves to slavery are cowards.” This got him
six months’ gaol. Ilis brother was Chief
Rabbi Abraham Bloch, of Lyons, who was
killed while carrying a crucifix to a wounded
soldier who had mistaken him for an R.C.
chaplain.
"Beauval” : Mention of Major-General Sir
Robert Porter (B. 25/10/’23) stirs my
grateful memory. One warm afternoon in
1917 I was at the St. Sylvestre-Cappel cross-
roads hoping for a lift into Hazebrouck. A
car approached and I held up my hand. As
it stopped, I noticed that the occupant was
a blinking General and I swiftly changed
the stop signal to a salute. I quite expected
to be “strafed” when I explained what I
wanted, but what I did get was a cheery
greeting, a lift not only to Hazebrouck but
to Da Motte, where my billet was, and a
cordial assurance, when I was put down,
that the favor extended to me had been
“Quite a pleasure, my boy.” While my dens
ex machine was in the hospital at Haze-
brouck, where he had stopped for a brief
inspection, I asked the driver who the Old
Man was. But by this time you’ll have
guessed it was Major-General Porter, Direc-
tor of Medical Services for the 2nd Army-
now surgeon on board the Khyber.
H. J. BAKER, who has resigned the chair-
manship of the Vic. Cost of Living Com-
mission, believing that, as constituted, it
is only a waste of time.
On October 18 Anglican Arclibish. Itiley,
of Perth, had been 29 years in gaiters. He
was ordained deacon in 187 S, priest in 1879
and consecrated bishop at Westminster in
1894 by Benson, of Canterbury, assisted by
six other Gaiters. Twenty years later he
became an arclibish. and Metropolitan of
the newly-formed ecclesiastical province of
Westralia. One of the most popular pre-
lates in Australia, he is a cheerily human
person, and his recreation is work.
THE DAYS OF OLD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We ride about in motor-cars, with luxuries supplied ;
Our lives are served by Modern Thought with Science
by its side.
Whenever we are out of sorts, or feel an inward
pain,
The doctor makes no foolish guess, but puts us right
again ;
And yet old dotards quote their youth, and we are
gravely told
We’ve lost the splendor of the days that used to
be of old.
The days of old when men were men—and very often
brutes —
And every day the gallows-trees hung out their dread-
ful fruits !
When men were like the cabbages that in. their vil-
lage grew —
This, with a town some miles away, was all the
earth they knew.
Yet even then the greybeards talked about the
age of gold
When life was really splendid—in the fruity days
of old.
The hoary frauds plagued Charlemagne; and Caesar
had to hear
What glorious times were in the youth of men whoso
days were sere.
The caveman even knew the bores (unless he killed
them quick)
Who talked about the days of old till younger men
were sick.
Through all the ages known to man the wretched
tale was told
About the splendor of the days that used to be of
old.
Earth holds its purest metal still; the future keeps
the best;
Man climbing up a mountain side has still to gain
its crest.
Horizons broaden as we climb, though lagging age
may sigh
For scenes it knew when youth was green and strength
and hope were high ;
But in this knowledge we can smile while agdd
gamblers scold —
Things never were as splendid as they used to be of
old !

ACROSS AUSTRALIA
A remarkable Overland” drive —Freemantle to Sydney in 85 Days
One. of the greatest achievements in the history of Australian motoring is the fine
performance of Drivers, Car, and Tyres just registered by Messrs. E. Croysdijl and
V Allerton of Melbourne, who, despite most adverse weather and route conditions,
succeeded in establishing New TranscQntinental Motor-car records between Fremantle
—Adelaide (beaten by I*l hours 40 minutes), Fremantle—Melbourne (beaten by
26 hours) and Fremantle—Sydney (beaten by 16 hours 14 minutes). The CAR used
in this great feat was an 18-H.P. 4-cylinder “OVERLAND ” shod with Australian-made
DUNLOP
(SMBmtEfl
It was a terrific test of TYRES, calling for the utmost dependability, as the success of
the undertaking depended on their staunchness. As usual, “ DUNLOP ” quality
withstood'the gruelling drive and came through in a remarkable. condition. They
were stock tyres; just the <same as supplied to our many thousands of patrons.
The new records for this 'overland route are: —
FREMANTLE— ADELAIDE
FREMANTLE— MELBOURNE
FREMANTLE— SYDNEY
(1734 miles) 130 hrs. 20 min.
(2329 miles) 155 hrs. 25 min.
(2889 miles) 199 hrs. 21 min.
The Previous Records were also held on Dunlop Tyres
The NEW DUNLOP CORDS - specially made, for Australian roads
give remarkable mileage, their quality, construction, and extra air
space ensuring free-from-trouble service at a price unapproached by
imported tyres. Fit them and be satisfied! Garages can supply.

“Cobba Cobba”: My entry for the Equine
Old Age Stakes is a pony owned by J. A. Powell,
of Mackay (N.Q.). A full 46 cane seasons have
come and gone since he first saw daylight, and he
looks fit enough to weather a few more years. Since
a foal the old chap has taken molasses with every
feed, and his present condition gives the lie to the
many who affirm that the use of molasses as a
fodder is very injurious to all classes of horses.
“Thusa Gamp” (Papua) : “Orion” and
“Early Bird” (B. 21/6/’23) having told of the
lady shearers, I put forth a claim for women
planters. AVho in these parts has not heard of the
indomitable Mrs. Mahony, of Sudest, trader and
planter; of the plucky little Mrs. Ede, isolated in
the Lachlans, and her thrilling stories of trouble-
some natives in the days when her son was a babe
in arms and her husband was away recruiting; of
that well-loved “Mother of Misima,” Mrs. Boyd, who
lived up in the mountains with her husband, pros-
pecting? For over eight years Mrs. Boyd never saw
another white woman, while working her' own claim
and sewing, cooking and nursing stray diggers, as
well as keeping the (then) savages from raiding her
stores. Many a time Mrs. Boyd has had her revolver
handy as she stood in the creek washing gold ; but
the great-hearted old lady won the confidence of
the “boys” with her never-failing humor, bravery
and medicine chest. Then there is Madame Bernier,
with her beautifully-kept plantation—“the busiest
woman in the Pacific,” the local people call her.
Her planting, her well-built house, poultry runs and
even her toolhouse would put many a, man planter
to shame. And her gardens! AVhat man would
think to have rose-beds adjoining his lounge, glow-
ing creepers over the copra-houses, and g'ardens well
stocked with southern vegetables, and yet do the
long hours of plantation routine work as. well ? To
see Madame in her well-cut suit, with top boots and
gloves, as she goes about her many duties, makes one
realise that she is still a very charming person; and
when you have eaten a lunch she has cooked you
bow to the woman while admiring the masculine will
that can manage her own large plantation, work her
labor and remain—Madame Bernier.
“Jimmy ’Possum”: “Borum’s” reference
to pillows made from the fibre of stringy-bark (B.
27/9' ’23) gives me the creeps. When stripping
bark years ago it was my job to shin up and cut
the top girdle, and the doing I got
from the spikelets of the outer bark
when peeling stringies still makes
me feel uncomfortable whenever I
think of it. These spikelets pene-
trate one’s clothing and set up an
irritation of the skin that becomes
almost unbearable after a time. I’d
Sooner pillow my napper on a por-
cupine than on a cushion made from
this stuff.
“Karee” : A few Bulletins
ago some bird wrote asking how long
carp lived. In the Royal ponds of
Fontainebleau are huge monsters,
which people flock to feed on Sundays,
and which are said to have been put
in by Gabrielle d’Estres in 1607. An
aunt of mine lives in a moated
chateau in Sologne. Regularly after
meals a gong is beaten, and huge
carp, covered with water-weeds and
shell incrustations, and bearing silver
rings on their gills, come under the
old banqueting-hall windows to re-
ceive scraps. When I was a kid my
aunt told me they were the luck of
the Lude family, and were first let
loose in the moats by one of her
husband’s ancestors in the 12th cen-
tury, and that should harm befall any
of them the Ludes would come a
crash, or words to that effect. Anxious
to probe the truth of her yarn, with
a brother and a bow and arrow I
souvenired one of the fish, and on
cleaning its silver ring (which, un-
known to my venerable auntie, I pre-
sented years after to the museum of
my Alma Mater) we found that the
old lady had slipped slightly, the
date on the stamped coat-of-arms be-
ing 22/7/1728 —which, however, is
fairly respectable. In spite of my
sacrilege the luck of the Ludes is
still going as strong as the whisky
chap; but somehow since that pisci-
eidal stunt I’ve been collecting thuds
—starting from the acute pains in
my little Mary which followed mv
trying to assimilate the rank and leathery flesh of
my victim.
* * * *
“Mouldy Ribs” : In none of the recent
pars about precocious flappers among stock was it
mentioned that the heroines kept on doing it; but
I had a young heifer that, after having given birth
to a bonny young bull calf when she was barely
TO STILL SCANDAL’S TONGUE.
JACKIE: “By cr[?], boss, mine tinkit I bin clear out of here.”
BOSS: “Why, Jackie?”
JACKIE : “Well, boss, mine missus say your missus bin talkit me too much. She bin
goin’ make trouble, mine tinkit.”
11 months old, produced another when her age stood
at 20 months, still another at 29 and a fourth when
she was 39 months old —all bull calves. After that
she apparently reckoned she’d done her bit, for the
fourth calf proved to be her last, and when I sold
her for beef at 7 years of age she pulled the
scales at 8491 b.
“X2X” : In the North it is a firm belief
that the only sure cure for an acute chronic case of
“Bareoo spew” is the patient’s removal to the tem-
perate south. I know a man, however, who con-
tracted the disease nearly 10 years ago in the Long-
reach (Q.) district, and after - everything (including
treatment at the Townsville Tropical Medicine In-
stitute) had failed to give him relief, left Long-
reach and went to live in the Temora (N.S.W.)
district. A few weeks afterwards the characteristic
vomiting ceased, only to return with the following
summer, and although he has never since left the
locality he still suffers as badly as ever in the
summer months. In one year symptoms of “Bareoo
rot,” with which he had also been afflicted, made
their re-appearance, but purely local treatment was
sufficient to banish these. Although evidence points
to the disease having a bacterial origin, it seems to
be more of a metabolic disturbance in his case,
despite the fact that, so far as he is concerned,
etiological factors previously reckoned essential ire
absent.
“Nor’-West" : I agree with “Wandi” (B.
4/10/’23) that “Yarrum” is altogether wrong in
asserting that the Murray cod was introduced ; but
“Wandi’s” suggestion that the Murray River
may have got its title from Binghi's name
for the fish (“murree”) won’t hold water.
The big trickle was christened' by Cap-
tain Sturt after a forgotten potentate in Eng-
land- —Sir Charles Murray, Secretary of S'tate for
the colonies.
“Riverina”: Queer accidents? I know a
Murray cocky’s wife who was horrified one day on
seeing her daughter, aged 18 months, being dragged
along by a cow’s horn, the point of which had pierced
the little one’s cheek. Strawberry—a very quiet
beast —had apparently done the deed accidentally
with a sudden swing of the head. The child suffered
little injury and the scar left by the puncture soon
became almost unnoticeable.
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum”: “Two Seas” (B.
G/9/’23) grinned because someone suggested that a
dingo might long- for human companionship. Well,
nearly 30 years ago, in a district in which warri-
g-als of the pure type can still be found to-day, I
was riding through unsettled country when a large
red-yellow dingo appeared in the track 100yds.
ahead. I put my dog after him, but, Warrigal being
too fast, old Nelson soon gave up the chase and re-
turned. As I rode on, I saw the dingo hop on to
a log and watch me out of sight. Two hours later
I happened to look behind, and there he was fol-
lowing less than 60yds. away. I sooled old Nelson
again; but after a half-hearted chase of 80yds. or
so he came back, and although I repeatedly tried
to induce him to tackle the dingo he disdained to
take any further notice of him. Thence on Warrigal.
with carelessly cocked-up tail and lolling tongue,
panted behind just like a tame deg, coming within
4yds, of the horse’s heels at times. Whenever l
looked back he would pull up short, regarding me
watchfully, and follow on again as soon as I faced
ahead. Occasionally he’d trot off the track to sniff
into a hollow log—behaving, in fact, in every war-
like an ordinary tyke. He followed for six hours,
then suddenly trotted off into the bush, and I
saw him no more. That was a full-blooded dingo,
and if it wasn’t my company he wanted, what wa„
HIS HOUSE IN ORDER.
F RIEND: “My goodness, man! I hope your
wife’s not waiting up for you.”
DRUNK : “Gonnabed — hie —long ago. I tole
Em’ly—hic—purra light in keyhole, an'
— an’ go a-bed!”
lie after? And why did he follow in the friendliest
'fashion after being chased? And, again,, why
wouldn’t my dog—a fierce fighter—tackle the dingo,
which wasn’t a lady ?
“Yarrum”: Is there a slower-growing ani-
mal on earth than the crocodile? A publican at
Mossman, near Port Douglas (Q.), had a juvenile
Cft. long-, and it added Sin. to its length in five
years. And it was well fed, too. At that rate
a croc. 20ft. long must be well over 200 years old —
which might account for the long fellow’s teeth
being- so few and so rotten.
(Continued on page 2^.)
DOING FINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I get a letter now and then
From mates I used to know,
AVho find the time to push a pen
For half a page or so.
To tell me how they’re getting on
They “send along a line,”
And when the postman’s been and gone
I see they’re “doing fine.”
Old Ben is on a little farm,
He calls it Yanco Flat;
He trusts I’m keeping out of harm,
And means a lot by that;
The flies are ruining his fruit
And eating up the vine;
He thinks he’ll give the place the boot—
But still he’s doing fine.
The wily Norman’s after oil—
He has his lease at last —
He lost, on ’planes and failed at toil,
But those bad days are past;
And up among New Guinea bogs,
AVhere men on men’s flesh dine,
And many good men reach the dogs,
1 learn he’s doing fine.
And Banjo (guess his other name)
AA'rites down from Gippsland way ;
He’s in the farm-utensils game,
And seems to make it pay ;
He mags to eockies large and small,
And sells a milking line,
And where the gum-trees .still grow tall
He travels, doing fine.
And Jock's come in from counting ewes,
And Starke’s got home from work;
You’d never dream, to read their “news,”
They’d ever seen a Turk.
They' seldom talk about the war,
Or mem’ries of the line,
But build a house and sink a bore,
And keep on doing fine.
You’d never dream unless you knew
That they had been to Hell;
They keep their Hell-marks cut of view,
And if of that they tell,
A HELPFUL HINT.
TEARFUL LADY : “I’ve come to tell you, sergeant, that
Fve missed me ’usband again for a fortnight.”
SERGEANT: “Well, perhaps if ye took a few lessons, ye’d
be able to throw straighten!”
The scenes are set by pleasant tracks,
Some miles behind the line,
With smokes and tucker in their packs,
And all hands doing fine.
And somehow their forgetting ways
Seem neither strange nor new;
They were the same in other days,
AVhen skies were not so blue ;
In days when, wallowing in mud,
They headed for the Rhine ;
Or, soaking stretchers with their blood,
They fainted —doing fine.
And I have come to understand
These Digger mates of mine.
And know the wasters fill the band
That rends the air with whine;
The fighting Digger’s fighting still,
As he fought in the line ;
And whether life is good or ill,
He’s always doing fine.

“McGoonk”: A few days ago I brought
home a four-day-old baby bunny, thinking it would
interest our infant; but as it was not received cor-
dially by her Highness, I placed it beside the cat,
who at the moment was busy giving her five young - -
sters their first meal. To my surprise Puss promptly
claimed the new-comer, and it very soon discovered
where the tucker was and made itself at home.
Bunny is well established now and gets his full
share of provender; and if we shift all the babies
out of their nest the old cat, in replacing the family
in the basket, always grabs the i-abbit first.
“Spadger”: A rod-polled Angus steer was
bought by a teamster in our district, and when the
yoke was first put on him he went mad and tried
to turn a somersault over it. lie landed with his
head doubled beneath him, and the teamster on
investigation found that the dud acrobat had broken
his neck. Having no weapon handy, he left the
beast where he was and went on. Next day he came
back meaning to despatch the unfortunate youngster,
but found him feeding about unconcernedly. For
years that broken-necked steer wandered* in the
paddock, always in good condition and advertising
his state only by the fact that he was unable to
move his head more than four inches from the ground.
THE IDLE RICH.
“Gripes, Mary, you Unlit y’self fine lady orright since we hin get
dis horse. Y’ gettin’ too flash ehen to ’urry y'self.”
“Ringer” : Reverting to the Ragged Thir-
teen (B. 6/9/’23), old-timers with whom 1 hare
conversed invariably spoke of “The Wild Colonial
Boy” as the leader of the mob, and although,
like “Bill Bowyang” (B. 28/8/’23), I’ve heard “The
Queensland Orphan” mentioned, the former seemed
to me to be the King G. “Monkey Mick” and
“Texas”—the latter a Yank —were two others I’ve
heard spoken of with pride. These two started a
butcher’s shop somewhere about the Ord (W.A.).
The cattle they killed belonged to anyone, and in
most eases they gave the meat gratis. Duffing
cleanskins was their downfall, but they escaped
arrest through the ,aid of a sympathetic policeman.
“Monkey Mick” under his dinkum name afterwards
ran a pub at Kalgoorlie.
“Green Hide Pat” (Oodnadatta) : “Ringer”
can add the following members of the Ragged
Thirteen to the 100-odd previously collected
NO TWO WAYS ’BOLT THAT.
STRANGER: “Am I .on the right track?”
TTIBUTER: “ ’Pends on where be goin '."
by him. The. first nine at any rate are as near
correct as it will be possible for him to get, if he
collects another 100-odd. The “Thirteen” at the
time they left Central Australia for Kimberley were:
Sandy Myrtle, Pat Daley (“The Priest”), Hugh Camp-
bell. Jack Jones (“Warnicker Jack”), Jack Martin
(“The Orphan”), Tom Nugent, Bill Austin, Jim
Norman, Matt Curwood, Tom Carrington, Tom Lyons,
and a couple of others whose names have slipped
my memory.
“J.8.1L”: I have come across scores of
men who claimed to belong to the Ragged Thirteen,
but the only one I knew for sure to have gone
with the gang right across to the Ord (W.A.) about
1886 was Charles O’Reilly, who was the first white
child born in Mackay (N.Q.). He was after that
horse-breaking, etc., in Central Queensland, and
had often tried to join the A.I.F. in the late
scrap.
* * * *
“Toe L.”: “Golub’s” par (B. 27/9/’23)
re the rat that killed
a 10ft. carpet-snake
reminds me of an inci-
dent that occurred
during the strike at
Mc K a y’s Harvester
Works, Sunshine (Vic.),
a few years ago. One
of the men caught a
young tiger-snake about
a foot long and put it
into an old kerosene-
tin. Later in the day
a mouse was caught
and dumped into the
tin also. To our sur-
prise, the mouse
showed no sign of
fear—he just stood
stock still for a few
seconds, then made a
quick bound on to the
snake and buried his
teeth in the back of
its neck. The “fight”
was over at once, all
the honors being with
the mouse. I’m pleased
to be able to add that
the mouse was given
his liberty, and told
to carry on the good
work.
“Bill R.” : Experienced gunmen know that,
notwithstanding the velocity of a flying wild-duck,
when shot in the air they invariably jerk several
feet backwards, stagger, and then (when dead) fall
almost perpendicularly. The remarkable shot by
Bill Rumph, whereby two crossing black ducks were
slain at Wallaga (N.S.W.), was a proof of this. One
of the birds shot through the head fell like a
plumb-bob; the other, only winged, struggled on
and hit the earth at a distance of 312yds. I know,
because I fired the somewhat fluky shot. And I
would like “Wolf” (B. 4/10/’23) to believe that I
am still in the flesh, although described as “the
late” in his par.
“Ragar”: Here’s still another case of a
dingo being, if not actually owned by, on very
friendly terms with, a man. In the ranges beyond
Gympie (Q.) a slut in-
troduced herself to a
Swede selector one
night as he slept on
his shakedown under
the fly. She was right
inside and close to the
man when he awoke,
but was off like a
shadow when he moved.
Next night she wis
back again. He told
me that it took him
over a month to get
her sufficiently at her
ease to allow him to
stand upright. After
that she would slink
into his camp after
dark every night and
stretch herself out
under the fly, but was
always away before
dawn. She’d eat the
scraps of food that
were tossed to her,
even taking the tough
samples of poorly-
cooked damper which
were now and then
offered. The Swede
swore that she was at-
tracted by the music
he nightly produced on
a mouth-organ, and she
would remain motion-
less for an hour on
end, listening to it. [
only once saw' her actu-
ally in the camp, and
then but for a moment,
for she rose with bared
fangs and bristling
hail’ and sneaked off as
I rode up. Others saw
her frequently, but
never in daylight. She
was pure dingo, and
almost khaki color.
“Billy Brolga”: The reference of “Two
Seas”; to tough o'd horse-breakers (B. 13/9/’23) re-
calls one Jimmy Rafe, who went west in Bananaland
a while back. Jimmy was still breaking-in when
bronchitis finished him at 74. It was his boast
that he had had every breakable bone in his body
smashed at some time or other, and when you saw
the fearless way he tackled anything that came
along you weren’t disposed to doubt his word. James
was a word painter, and when , things went wrong
he hurled verbal color right and left. Although
hasty-tempered and rough with unruly animals, he
was kind to his prads as a rule, talking to them
caressingly in a mixture of native lingo and pidgin-
English.
“Pick” ; Sheep will follow any leader, and,
profiting by this, the “yarder-up”—-the rouseabout
who has the least coveted job in the sheds —often
has a well-trained decoy, to pilot the stubborn mobs
into their pens. On many stations poddy wethers
are constantly employed at shearing and drafting
times, and so accustomed to the job are they that the
yarder simply opens the gates and they fill the
pens by leading up the stupids in their turn. At
many Out-West peeling establishments goats—always
more manageable than the woollies —are regularly
used as leaders, and poddied calves are also often
pressed into the service. And one strenuous time at
Bringaree (N.S.W.), when the sheep were almost too
poor to crawl along the races, the station’s tame
emu always stalked solemnly in their van as they
staggered towards the chairs.
“The Rumpus”: Can any Abo.-councillor
speak with authority re the variations of the kooka-
burra’s laugh ? When I was a youngster in Banana-
land the local Binghis took great notice of Jack’s
mirth, especially in the early morning or late even-
ing. Different tones and longer or shorter hilarity
all had weather meaning, and the nigger could aiid
did lay his plans accordingly. When the Govern-
ment used to issue annual blankets to Black Brother,
it generally happened after the winter rains had
started ; but always a week or so before the first
actual shower members of the tribe would pay a
visit to the police-station and make., known the
coming wet conditions. When questioned about
their unerring knowledge they always asserted that
the kookaburra “tell it this pfeller.”
“Larry Longun”: “Bill R.” says (B.
13/9/’23) he knows of only one sort of timber
(yellow-box) that equals red-gum for durability in
the ground. Has he never heard of yellow stringy-
bark? This timber, or its kindred, will outlast
any gum, besides being practically fire-proof. I
know a fence of very light posts of yellow stringy
which is still serviceable after withstanding the
ravages of the weather and annual bushfires for more
than half a century. The only posts demolished by
fire were those which happened to be in the way of
a falling burning tree and those in the water-courses
around which debris collected during floody weather.
“Sir Spen” : I once saw a curious result
of promiscuous inbreeding on a station in the
Moree (N.S'.W.) district. A number of sheep in-
tended for “killers” were segregated in a small
paddock, and no precautions taken towards regu-
lating the love affairs of the male progeny. After
a few years it was noticed that the horns of the
younger generations began to assume all sorts oi
fantastic shapes. Some grew an extra twist or two
with real corkscrew effect, and others sprouted
straight; but the daddy of them all was a noble
head bearing a pair of horns curling gracefully
downwards in the usual style, while an extra pair
branched skywards about 2ft., like the antlers of
a stag.
“Lou” : A practice which hasn’t much to
recommend it is that of keeping a “night horse”
yarded all night on the far-out stations, so that it
can be used to run up the mob in the morning,
feed should always be available for the lonely one,
but it hardly ever is; and no one seems to think
of rugging him for his long, still fast from sun-
down to dawn. Many a kindly horse tailer mounts
an empty shivering animal, for what is oftentimes
quite a strenuous muster, with a fellow feeling for
the poor beast.
* * * *
“Barcoo”: There was a howl of derision
out west over a recent par about the running down
of a dingo in a motor-car. Well, listen. Hamilton,
manager of Longford station (C.Q.), while out in-
specting his windmills, spied out in the centre of
one of the claypan plains that reach almost to the
horizon and are almost as level as a billiard table,
a full-grown dingo that had been known to be
inside the dingo-proof (?) netting for 12 months,
but had always evaded trap and bait. The car was
set full speed at the warrigal. It had him screwing
in the first quarter of a mile, and eventually ran
clean over him. By this time he was a thoroughly-
cowed dingo, and was easily brought down with a
shot from a breech-loading gun from the car.
Incidentally, anyone attempting to emulate this feat
is warning-ly informed that in the excitement of the
chase the machine was turned so sharply when the
dog doubled that the contraption, by the look of its
wheel tracks when viewed after the run, must
have just missed capsizing, as it had apparently
turned round on little less than its eyebrow.
ALL DESERT.
“Where does this road lead to?”
“Nowhere, loss. The no-lieense coves has
got both pahs closed up now.”
“Two Seas” re-introduces his gent.-help:—
Although ’Arold was reared in Sydney he isn’t a
natural genius among horses, and the difference be-
tween the near- and the off-side has been a sore
subject between us ever since he arrived on the
creek. The other day I again explained to him, in
words of one syllable, that if he stood behind the
horse the near-side was on his left hand, and the off-
side on. his right. That evening after supper i
noticed him staring thoughtfully at a portrait of
Carbine over my fireplace, and 1 seized upon the oppor-
tunity of testing him. “Is that the near-side or the off-
side you’re looking at?” I inquired. “’E’s onlv
got one side —’ow can I tell?” replied ’Arold. “Well,
what is that one side?” ’Arold got up from his
chair, squinted at the picture from the corner
nearest old Carbine’s rump, then remarked: “That’s
just wot puzzles me, boss, because I can’t get fair
behind ’im to see, can I?” By the time I had re-
covered consciousness ’Arold w'as in his den at the
back. Next morning, when saddling up, I had an
inspiration. I called ’Arold. “See this pouch
strapped to my saddle?” He did. “That pouch
always hangs on the near-side, so perhaps you’ll be
able now to remember which side to unbuckle the
girth.” “Ah, now you’ve said somethink,” said
’Arold gratefully. “If you’d told me that at the
start w'e’d er saved er lot er rows.” That afternoon
Jack Bradshaw turned up, and his horse was handed
over to ’Arold to off-saddle and feed. Two hours
later Jack went out to saddle-up, and I w'as lighting
my pipe at the kitchen fire, when I heard him roaring
up ’Arold. “You blighted idiot!” he was shouting.
“Haven’t you learned yet how' to unbuckle a girth?
What the devil do you mean by doing it on the off-
side?” “I didn’t,” howled ’Arold, “that’s the near-
side.” “Who told you that?” barked Jack. “The
boss told me,” shouted ’Arold. “And I don’t believe
either of yous knows the near-side of an ’orse yerselves.”
I thought it was time for me to take a hand in the
argument, so I went outside; and when I looked at
Jack’s saddle 1 groaned. “O Lord, you're carry-
ing your pouch on the off-side !” “What the blue blazes
has that to do with it?” gasped Jack, looking as
though he had suddenly landed in a lunatic asylum.
“Do with it?” I echoed. “Your blankv pouch has
undone weeks of weary teaching, and destroyed
’Arold’s faith in my infallibility.” Then I explained
the reason of ’Arold’s confidence that he had taken
off a saddle right for once and had been kicked for
doing it.
THE SINGLE-FURROW PLOUGH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I was strollin’ round the paddicks,
Lookin’ at the ’arf-grown w’eat,
Were the wild oats near the fences
Is a foot above yer feet,
W’en I stumbled over somethink
That was lyin’ in me track,
An’ it fetched me down a buster,
An’ I landed on me back.
Then I swears, an’ says,
“Cord spare me days !
Wot ever’s ’it me now?”
An’ I found I’d struck an old, old friend—
The single-furrow plough !
She’d been lyin’ there fergotten
In the weeds beside the fence
Since the days w’en us poor cookies
Sold our w’eat at eighteenpeuce.
An’ fer ev’ry single furrow
I’ll go bail we walked a mile;
An’ we arsked ourselves, “Well, blarst it!
Is it worth the blanky w’ile?”
But the wife an’ kids
Took no ’arf bids:
So I says to me, “You cow!
If they can stick it w’y can’t you
An’ the single-furrow plough!”
Then at larst the “stump-jump” started,
An’ the “super” an’ the “drill,”
An’ the agents rose the prices
At the Balaclava mill,
An’ we didn’t go insolvent
Quite so often in a year,
But we sang the Song of Sometime
An’ the days of Better Beer!
Still in kind of ways
Them were the days,
W’en we toiled with sweatin’ brow
As we trudged be’ind the two-horse team
An’ the single-furrow plough !

Dame Margaret Davidson and tlie two
children sailed by the Euripides on Saturday,
and the wharf was crowded with friends to
call a last good-bye. The Lieut.-Governor
Cullens were the last to leave the boat; the
Justice Gordons were there, and Mrs. Willie
Collins and a group of little girl- and boy-
chums from the classes that Daphne and
Diana had attended in the Gordon home.
From an early hour flowers had been pouring
into the family’s cabins, until just before the
Euripides sailed they resembled a garden
close, with roses and lilac holding pride of
place. Dame Margaret, looking thoroughly
distressed in her mourning, stood at the rails
waving good-bye. Rut the big good-bye had
taken place on Thursday, when for the
last time she had stood in the ballroom of
Government House, and had shaken hands
with a long, long queue of Sydney’s women.
Incidentally, the women’s testimonial is now
over £5OO.
Saturday hoist a blue tent of sky, laced
through with the song of birds and tlie glow-
ing leafage of late Spring, over the garden
fairs that sprang on many a lawn in the
cause of Charity. The ex-pupils of Redlands
did well for the Children’s Hospital from a
fete in the school grounds opened by Mrs.
Philip Street: Professor David’s lady pro-
vided a Yale-key of speech for another in
the spreading grounds of the Renwick Rabies’
Hospital at Summer Hill; and Mrs. Charlie
Oakes gave a sprightly pusli-off to the fete
at Tressillian, the mothercraft training-home
at Petersham. Dr. Clubbe —no finer friend
has the Sydney child than he —put forward
a plea for more accommodation at Tressillian
for nurses and mothers; and Charlie Oakes
dropped words of good cheer over the
gathering.
Acting-vice-reine Cullen opened this year's
exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society on
Tuesday afternoon —it is being held, as
usual, in the Education Gallery. The out-
standing work is in hand-woven scarves and
bags. Jessica Rootli and Miss McKenzie
are responsible for the colorful corner that
might be a stall in a Persian bazaar. The
Gallery bought one of the bags woven by
Miss Rooth, and so that future ages might
not say needleeraft was wholly neglected in
this jazzy generation, a d’oyley worked by
Mrs. Maxwell has also been secured for the
national treasure. A vase by Mrs. Eyre and
some bookbinding by Miss Alston will also
live in the Gallery cabinets. The basket
work and leather goods are up to standard,
and Mrs. Algie’s silver spoons are a joy to
lovers of form.
The Astor —the Macquarie-street block of
flats that will prove the towering landmark
for its part of the city that Kingsclere is
for Darlinghurst—was opened last week with
pomp and Ceremony mingled with ices and
tea on the roof garden. The pomp and cere-
mony was supplied by Premier George Fuller
and other politicians, who took an hour or
two off from the work of the country to
hand out a welcome to the materialisation
of this new scheme in house-building. In a
way you buy your flat: that is to say, you
buy a certain number of shares in the co.
which owns the block, and this shareholding
gives you rights to part of the building. For
practical purposes £3500 will buy you a flat
—and when you don’t want it you can sell
your shares. Eaditli Walker is in the new
colony, and Dr! Foreman, and half a hun-
dred others. From the roof one sees the
kingdoms of the earth, or, ’tanyrate, every
quarter of the city; green tree and glistening
harbor, and beyond the shimmering water
terraces of coral roofs and emerald
spaces; and Pinchgut looking like a
toy at your feet. To stand there with
the wind blowing from a limitless hori-
zon, and Port Jackson a straight track to
the Heads, is like perching in the prow of
a vessel whose port of call could only be the
Happy Isles.
The most exclusive limousines in Sydney
parked outside the Palais Royal last Friday
night, when the ball in aid of the Prince
Alfred Hospital kept moving to such feet-
inspiring classics as the “Sheik of Alabam.”
The popular Mrs. Tommy Marks secretaried
the dance. She and her doctor husband
spread an extensive dinner party at the Aus-
tralia beforehand, and in a season of lovely
roses the centre bowl of deep-red beauties
on her table caused a general sigh of ad-
miration. At the Palais notables like Theo
Marks and the Earl of Strathspey disported
themselves under the forest "of paper
streamers that rustled aloft, or sat in the
funny little palanquined boxes that suggest a
pantomime on the primrose path. The de-
corations of the Palais are truly weird and
wonderful. Bronzie Clonan and her partner
won the first place in the jazz contests;
and Bendrodt and Peggy Dawes glided about
in a Chicago in which a sleuthing spot-
light failed to discover a flaw. The French
Consular Campanas and the Attorney-
General Bavin couple added to the mad
revelry.
The big afternoon flutter of the week was
the Cabaret Tea at the Wentworth arranged
by the committee of the Operatic and Car-
nival Ball. The ball was in aid of the Hos-
pice for the Dying, and the money from the
Cabaret went to wipe out the expenses. Red
roses were everywhere. Josephine Marks
was the pirate at the entrance door who
offered them at a shilling each, and sold a
garden full. It was easy money—the beau-
ties had petals like black satin and a per-
fume so heady that it made every woman
imagine herself a houri in a Persian garden.
(Fortunately everybody’s husband or near-
husband was too busy on his job to come
dancing, so there were no homes disrupted.)
Jean Curlewis, whose mother—Ethel Turner
she was and for writing purposes remains—
is probably the mostly widely read of Aus-
tralian authors (her “Seven Little Austra-
lians” holds pride of place in the kiddies’
section of the public libraries of Norway),
was married the other night at St. Luke’s,
Mosman, which had been turned into a rose-
walk by the bride’s girl chums. Up an
avenue of pale pink and deep red Jean
walked on father’s arm (lie’s Judge Cur-
lewis) to meet her future lord, Dr. Leonard
Charlton, of Pymble. She was frocked in
a fairy-like confection of shimmering satin
and pearl-encrusted tulle that surely
eclipsed the most intoxicating vision of bridal
finery ever dreamed by one of mother’s flap-
per heroines. A long wash of silver tissue
train embroidered in languishing silver roses
frothed after the pretty girleen, who was
further embellished with a mist of tulle veil-
ing and an armful of white rosebuds. Four
bridesmaids, Ailsa Cullen, Amy Hungerford,
Hylda Holdsliip and Lucile Stewart, in
spreading skirts of pink taffetas and black
tulle hats, finished with pink posies and
streamers, were colorful decorations, and
Jean’s brother Adrian rendered first-aid to
the ’groom. The wedding meats were spread
at Avenel, the Curlewis home, where Ethel
Turner Curlewis did the honors in a frock,
mostly glistening black sequins, that flew a
■ wing-like effect in georgette as blue as her
own eyes; and the Lieut.-Governor Cullens
(he proposed the health of the bride) added
their congratulations to those of over a
hundred other lights in the legal and medical
worlds. The newly-weds sailed for England
on Saturday.
Mrs. Frances Zabel, the lady of this pic-
ture, has come to anchor in Sydney after
26 voyages in Europe, Asia and Africa.
Westralians need no introduction to her;
she was an early goldfielder, and was later
connected for years with the Perth Daily
News. It was she who founded the Book
Lovers’ Library in the western capital, that
oasis of art and literature which all young
aspirants to fame looked upon as a high
altar. Here you found the book that was
nowhere else in Australia, or beautiful prints
of Old Masters. Here, too, many a young artist
sold his first
picture, for
Mr s. Zabel’s
library always
li a d friendly
wall space at
the disposal of
a hard-up be-
ginner. Tli e
lady also wrote
and published
the F. Z. Re-
view, a little
monthly de-
signed “on the
J ack Horner
principle o f
putting my
thumb into a
good book, and
serving up the
plums in a
way that read-
ers may judge
whether they
like that particular literary pie or not.” The
lady is an intimate of many of the writers
of England, and she numbers the Yeats
family, Susan Mitchell and “A.E.” among
her friends. She has now taken over the
Roycroft Library in City House, Pitt-street.
Mrs. Zabel still nurses her great sorrow.
Ferdinand—he was his mother’s only son, a
brilliant Melbourne Grammarian, and the
most youthful F.G.S. of his time —after
being interned in Germany throughout the
war, died of fever somewhere in the heart of
Africa a couple of years ago.
St. Mary’s harbored some handsome frock-
ing when Jean Kerr, of Glebe Point, became
Mrs. Arthur Hatherleigli Weston. Jean
wore her ivory satin in a classic drape, en-
veloped her head in mists of tulle, and drew
after her a trail of silver train that in the
gloom of the Cathedral suggested the path of
the moon across the harbor. There were
four bridesmaids and a tiny trainbearer
whose frocking was a froth of silver lace and
pink georgette: The Lochinvar of the occa-
sion had four henchmen to stand by him,
and there was a monster cake-cutting at
the Australia to round off the day.
Rene Tanqueray, the gazelle-eyed French
Vice-Consul in Sydney, has taken the plunge
and offered himself in matrimony to Dadye
St. Laurence-Toner, who now flies the usual
keep-off-tlie-grass warning to other suitors.
The young man, who has a manner as gentle
as the silken whisper of leaves, saw two
years’ active service in the Champagne and
Aisne sectors and two years’ further service
as interpreter with the U.S.A. Expeditionary
Forces. This is his first Consular job.
Dadye is three-quarters Maorilander and
an old pupil of the Sacred Heart Convent
(and that’s the swaggahest school of the
Dominion). On mother’s side she’s a niece
of Enzed’s K. C. Tole, who for a time was
Minister for Justice in the Rickety Isles.
Here’s a May Moore picture of Rhoda
Wager, whose hand-wrought jewellery is one
of the striking features of the Arts and
Crafts show
this week.
Mostly of oxi-
dis e d silver,
beaten into
mediaeval and
original d e-
signs, her rings
and brooches
are toys for
anyone’s de-
light. Funny
little vanity-
bag mirrors,
with gum-nuts
woven around
the edge, sug-
gest Marianas
and moated
granges, and
the Lady of
Shalott when
she knew
Tennyson’s
eye wasn’t on
her. Miss Wager (Mrs. Percy Ashton out-
side the studio) is an exhibitor also with
the Society of Artists, and several fine pieces
of her work have been secured by the
National Art Gallery.
There’s been a lovely morsel of gossip for
the birds and the beetles during the past
mating season—Alec Chisholm, the nature-
study king, has been preparing the nest
which “Dearest” (the baby name has stuck)
liazeler, of Brisbane, is about to share after
a gorgeous ceremony and a wonderful wed-
ding feast stage-managed by bride’s aunt, the
famed Mrs. J. Cain, of Lennon’s Hotel. The
bridegroom’s friends have been scattering
congratulatory bird-seed for him during the
past fortnight. Inky Wayfarer Sowden was
one host. The Ornithologists also tendered
him the cutlet of congratulation, a floating
bowl and an upstanding kingfisher. Neville
Cayley had painted the menus (two love-
birds) ; there were present Dunbabin, Hull,
and other bird-men; and they had with a
fine sense of the fitness of things picked
the kiosk in the Gardens for their luncheon.
Nellie Black, the violinist of the family
orchestra which was known in Maoriland as
the “All Blacks,” returns to Enzed to fulfil
a matrimonial engagement with J. Prentice,
of Invercargill. Nellie was a Dunedin lass,
but how she will enjoy Invercargill’s dour
climate after sunny Sydney takes a big note
of interrogation. Complimentary foodstuffs
and ornate ices have been spread before her
for weeks past by admiring friends.
A generous Digger has offered Dame Alice
Chisholm his cottage at Corrimal to be used
as a seaside home for country women until
the Country Women’s Association has built
its own camps. This is an echo of gratitude
from the days when Dame Alice’s camp at
Kantara was the Mecca of Digger and
Tommy on their way to the lines.
Edwin Geach looks slim and rejuvenated
after a long holiday jaunt with his wife.
Though his clothes have the cut of Bond-
street, Geach says his “nose was flat” when
Mrs. Geach got her way in furrin shops.
She began with Grace Palotta’s place in
Colombo, and finished up with Fiftli-avenue
on the way home. The Fifth-avenue trunk
went a-missing at Auckland, and Mrs. Geach
stayed behind to trace her treasures. After
four days of tragedy they were discovered
among the baggage of a third-class passenger
in a Salvation Army Home! The Geaches
flew from Brussels to Paris, and had an hour
or two of intense interest: much of the
route was over the red-tiled roofs of newly-
built France. A ’plane that was a few
hours ahead of them was burnt to cinders —
passengers and all. Geach was horrified
to discover that they carried a cargo of
picture-films—and knowing all about films
he wrote strong letters to London on the
subject. Like every Sydney-sider who wan-
ders, he is glad to be home.
Former Sydneyite G. G. Masson, Inspec-
tor of Agriculture (he was lieutenant of the
9th A.L.11.) at Haifa, Palestine, and his
wife (she was nurse J. M. B. Andrews,
A.A.M.S., of Sydney) were at home to the
Stork at Mt. Carmel on July 20, and the
wise bird dropped a bouncing'baby-boy into
the home circle as a souvenir.
Colonel MacFarlane, the good-looking,
athletic eligible of the Queen Vic. Barracks
staff, has taken a soldiering appointment
in India. That’s where the eyes of many
of the young fighting men are directed just
now. He’s a good dancer, and that is one
passport to the social life in the hill sta-
tions.
Nell Joske and her mother are in the
Sydney exodus to Europe; so are the Waley
mother and daughters.
A striking Biblical play called “Esther,”
by Beatrice Wilson, has been read by the
Sydney Lyceum Club. Esther Kahn has
composed some musical illustrations, and the
whole will be sent to the Piccadilly Lyceum
Stage Society in London.
It’s to be the country’s turn next. Gay-
field Shaw has secured an up-to-date motor-
lorry, which is to be transformed into a tra-
velling gallery, to show Australian paintings
and etchings in the country towns. He is
now making final arrangements for the grand
tour.
A Brisbane postcript:—
Sir Matthew flew to Toowoomba and rested a
space at the M neas McDonnells’ place, where he
learned something about the new Federal Labora-
tory and Baby Clinic ; then he paid a visit to Sun-
thorpe, and got back to the home town on the 25th.
At the last night of the A.N.A. Eisteddfod his Ex.
spoke up for the musical ability of Australians. As
music comes naturally to a large proportion of young
Aussies, he thought the clear air and the sunshine
had much to do with their spontaneous carolling.
In the competitions, the sweet-toned Curlew male
choir, in Buck’s “Twilight,” scored a first, with the
Sanclgate Orpheus Glee Club hard upon their winning
notes.
Laurence Grossmith, who is strutting the quarter-
deck as Ambrose Applejack before going into
Quarantine, says some pretty things about the
Sydney Criterion as an ideal theatre. On his open-
ing -night in His Majesty’s here there was a very
big house, and in the audience were Judge Shand
and his lady, the Whittinghams, the Cecil O’Beirnes,
Tullys, Norwood Browns, C. 0. Mants and Morgan
Lancs.
At Long-reach the other day, Edna Cory, daughter
of the late Charles Cory, of Hughenden station, said
“I will” to Eric Donald Inglis, of Wellshot. Two
braw pipers played before and after taking, and
Parson Wilson administered the ceremonial dose. The
honeymoon is shining over Sydney.
The Royal Automobilites ran their own cars and
other peoples’ to Sandgate for the crippled babies’
pathetic little yearly jaunt. Gingerbeer, buns, fruit
and sweets were demolished on the grass, and then
the clouds grew black and the 700 chicks had to be
dashed back to town again. Somehow, it always
rains on the day the mites have their picnic.
Hutchison Cass has been carried off as Com-
mandant to Hobart, and the Colonel’s lady has had
several functions served up for her. The latest was
Mrs. J. L. Wooleock’s shivoo at Lennons’. Mr.
Woolcock and Mrs. Sandford helped, and the gathering
included the Arthur Pierson and Harding dames,
the Huybers, Lefanu and Eric Molle, Capt. Ham-
mond, A.D.C., the Deardon and Kirwan girleens,
Mary Grant from Bowenville, Lex Macnaughton and
John Flower.
While up on Mount Cootha the R.A.C. of Queens-
land held a moonlight jazz in the One Tree Hill pavi-
lion the other evening, and a big roll-up tried the
new floor.
For George Sampson’s orchestral concert there was
a good muster in the Exhibition Concert Hall. His
Ex. had with him the Digby Denhams, Mrs. J. Jack-
son, Tom Mcllwraith Taylor, Grace Deshon, Capt.
Hammond and Michael 1 Rogers. The Shands and
Espie Dods, Canon de Witt Batty, and the Canon
Camplings were also among the listeners.
On the same night “Twelfth Night” was staged in
the Centennial Hall by the Shakspeare Society be-
fore a gathering of professors, doctors, society folk
and Tom Heney.
Dr. A. B. Brockway, who has published novels
under the name of “Archibald Birt,” was married
(for the second time) in St. Mark’s at Woody Point
a few days ago. The bride was Mrs. Allen Walker,
of Woody Point, and she played her part in grey
marocain and a gold tissue hat. Her son gave
her away, and her daughter and the bridegroom's
daughter stood by her. Brother medico C. F. Marks
best-manned, and the honeymoon rose over Stan-
thorpe.
The Education Department is setting out to give
girls outside the metropolitan area a hand. It has
had two railway waggons fitted with tables, seats
and equipment for instructing 12 students in cook-
ing, dressmaking, millinery and housewifery—the
equipment includes two stoves and two sewing-
machines. Provision will be made for courses in
six small towns in one year, with intervals of two
years between visits.
We have made up our minds to go * gay in the
first week of December to celebrate the 100th
anniversary of our birthday. John Oxley, an early
Surveyor-General, discovered us; a tableau repre-
senting his landing will be staged. Processions,
regattas, inter-State cricket and fireworks will be
other features. An inevitable “Back to Brisbane”
week will also be included, and a historical record
of the early days of the city is being prepared as
a memento.

must necessarily wear
SILK Half-Hose, it follows that an
improvement in the QUALITY,
the APPEARANCE and the
SERVICE of Silk Half-Hose
at a REDUCTION IN COST
must necessarily be con-
sidered a genuine boon.
And that is just what
“SYLK - ARTO” accom-

in its manufacture has the
unique attribute of being a PURE SILK
THREAD, yet possesses the LUSTROUS
FINISH which is the most attractive feature of
the finest Artificial Silk. At the same time, it is
capable of WEAR-AND-TEAR RESISTANCE
never before equalled by either Silk or Artificial

Henley and the sunshine tempted a record
crowd to the Yarra banks. The three-shilling
reserve was thickly populated, but the social
elect mostly stayed away, perhaps owing to
the sudden slump in houseboats. The craft
on view were mostly colored canoes which
floated down the watery track freighted with
bright-eyed youth. Both Government Houses
turned out to the carnival. The Forsters
interned themselves all day on the presiden-
tial boat, but the Stradbroke pair strolled
round to the joy of the crowd, which had
come to view all that was to be seen. Lady
Forster wrapped herself in ermine above a
fawn frock, while the Stradbroke Countess
flew a fawn cloak and beamed on the world
from under a small flower-dressed hat. The
Earl did his promenade hand-in-hand with
the littlest Rous son, Christopher. Irene
Vanbrugh and her stage companions also
viewed the scene from the presidential barge,
where ex-Senator George Fairbairn hosted
with graceful geniality and some assistance
from son Clive’s father-in-law, Edmund
Jowett. Captain Pitt Rivers and Jack Fis-
ken chatted on the upper deck, and medical
kuiglit Charlie Ryan, vividly blue-shirted,
was busy with a pocket camera. The Arcli-
bisli. and Mrs. Lees were there, and Col.
Willie Robertson convoyed his good-looking
wife and their small son. (Daughter Mary
is budding out as a grown-up at the Leslie
Stuarts’ forthcoming whirl.) Melbourne
Club sec. Captain Tracey brought Ins
famous smile and his pleasing other half,
and General Cuscaden had under his wing a
pretty daughter and Betty MacMeickan, m
grey silk (just back from a month at the Clive
Fairbairns’ Albury squattage) ; the Seymour
Dennises and several other social lights
shone on the proceedings.
The Governor-General and Lady Forster,
who issued commands to their annual ball the
other day, have now broadcasted pasteboards
for the usual garden party on the following
afternoon.
Both vice-regal houses -were represented at
the Palace Theatre on Saturday night for
the release of Hugh Ward’s farce-comedy,
“Tons of Money.” The Forsters came in for
a warm greeting, and the crowd thereafter
nearly shattered the roof with a wild and
woolly welcome to the Stradbroke pair. Lady
Forster was cloaked in black dashed with
blue- Mrs. Pitt Rivers veiled herself m a
white silken shawl under a glittering head-
dress, while Lady Pat Blackwood sparkled
in red. The cheery Stradbroke Countess flew
gold embroideries on sleeveless black hang-
ings, and bandaged her head with gold;
daughter Helena, who has brought back a
friendly smile from her London season, was
also inkily frocked, and the lady-help, Hester
Phillimore, who is a good-looker, was clnf-
foned in pink. Hugh Ward and his wife sat
in the pen adjacent to the Forsters, and Dot
Brunton’s mother was alongside the Strad-
brokes’ box. Of course, Dorothy had to
voice her thanks in finale —the house howled
for it. To do so she had to climb over a
ton of floral trophies which walled in the
stage-front.
Ex-Gent.-help Lord Digby’s sister Venetia,
who fluttered captivatingly for a couple of
weeks as the vice-regal Forsters’ guest, has
now booked a life journey with a naval loot,
one Cornwallis, who wears 0.8. E. behind
his name and O.W. in front of it.
The day the Stradbrokes landed back in
Melbourne they arrived at the Town Hall
a bit ahead of schedule time, and found only
a guard of honor of Boy Scouts waiting to
receive them, the Gaud Mayor and his cor-
poration colleagues being’ seated upstairs
waiting for an intimation by ’plionc that the
vice-regals were on their way from Port
Melbourne. Which recalls an incident con-
nected with Kitchener’s visit to Hobart. A
guard of honor was drawn up outside the
railway station, and the Mayor, town clerk
and aldermen, arrayed in all their war-
paint, were seated in open carriages in readi-
ness to bid him welcome, when a message
came through that the train would be an
hour late. Thereupon the mayoral party
returned to the Town Hall, after leaving
directions to be ’phoned for m time to meet,
the train. The first message must have been
a hoax, as not 10 minutes later the train
bringing “K.” arrived. After inspecting the
"uard of honor he at once left for Govern-
ment House in the carriage awaiting him
Then the fun began. After the visitor had
got a good start the flustered Bumbles
arrived on the scene only to find their bird
flown, and they started off in frantic pur-
suit. That was the only time Kitchener
ever fled before an enemy, and he thorougn y
enjoyed it.
The Alliance Frangaise, which has been
piling up social weight, threatens to revive
a taste for culture in this jazz-ridden citj.
It has now sent out an S.O.S. for new mem-
bers, and is getting an encouraging response.
Hon. sec. P. Herry intimates that future acti-
vities will be reinforced by a series ot little
dinners at the Lyceum Club at four-and
threepence per eater, the first to be seivtd
on Nov. 23. .
Ladv Forster, who frou-froued glittering
blue panels under a black satin dommo, smiled
vice-regal approval of the Alliance s bteiaij
“swarry” in the Independent Hall. Little
Ladv Pat Blackwood, dimpling under her
Ex’s wing, was fur-coated to the chin over
a splash of deep red; and gent.-lielp Law-
rence beamed cheerfully m the offing. Co
sul Turck, aided by the president, Mrs.
Jirnmv Dyer, the vice-president, Mrs. Alber-
tine Gay, and lion. sec. Herry, convoyed the
vice-regal presence to the place ot honor.
Prof. Lodewyckx talked enlighteningly for
half the time about a traditional hero of the
Netherlands, and the remainder of the pro-
gramme was filled in with a highly diverting
comedy. Those who had an intimate acquaint-
ance with the language chortled delightedly
while those who had not did their best to
look intelligent.

dren, is having another look at England. 1

The Lawn Tennis Association refuses to let
the swamping of the new courts at Looyong
get it down. The grass plots are being dried
off and top-dressed for early use, but the
asphalt courts will have to be made over
again. The damage runs into about £4UUU.
There was a general howl of I told you
so” after the disaster, for the ground has
always been submerged in very wet seasons;
but now means are being devised to shoo off
any future floodings.
The other night the committee snapped its
fingers at the debacle by staging a second_jazz
event in the Kooyong clubhouse Ehe lights
shone dimly with a rosy glow, and the oiches
tra played with a restrained delicacy, re-
membering that the crowd was there to chat-
ter as well as dance. Among the fox-trottcrs
were Gerald Patterson and his wife, cham-
pioness Esna Boyd and association sec Koch

Eileen Starr, whose well-poised soprano
has been frequently aired on the concert plat-
form here and in Sydney, has stepped on to
the newly-engaged list with Reg Russell, son
of the Houghton Russells, of Box Hill.
The ’Varsity Corn’s complimentary con-
cert to Frances McCall packed the Town
Hall on Friday night. The star items were
provided by the youthful soprano herself,
beginning with “Elizabeth's Prayer,” from
“Tannhauser,” ending with “Lo Hear the
Gentle Lark.” The Tasmanian girl, who is
still in the early training stages, warbles
with a natural grace which up for
most of her technical disabilities. She pos-
sesses a voice of surprising range and
quality, a fine stage presence and a tem-
peramental artistry which found a perfect
outlet in “Robin Adair.” Even in this land
of songbirds, few voices are laden with
greater possibilities.

Frank Rigo is about to test the quality
of Melbourne’s alleged musical hunger with
a four-weeks’ season of grand opera m Lng-
lish. It will begin at the Playhouse on
December 22 with “Hansel, and Gretel
the first Australian production. Unfortu-
nately the date will land the enterprise right
into the silly season, which is also the hot
season, when half Melbourne is cooling oft at
the seaside or the mountains. Afterwards
the co. will go on tour. Rigo s idea is to
plug the waste flow of Australian vocal
talent. Melba is cheering the venture on
and has backed her verbal cheers by cabling
for 250 shares in the co. All the local
musical heads are actively supporting the
enterprise, and the James Dyers have topped
the subscription-ticket list with a £5O cheque.
Last week Dr. Hoystead’s wife roped in
her lady friends to chin-chin her elder
daughter, Dorothy Salmon, over the Menzies
teacups. Mrs. Hoystead flew insets of
Oriental colors on her raven marocain, and
had blue feathers on her black hat. Dorothy,
who steams off to Colombo with her newly-
made husband aboard the Ormuz, was organ-
died in yellow tuckings and smiled beneath a
superstructure of black with yellow-and-
white flowers in the vicinity of her left ear;
while flapper-sister Edith radiated under the
rosy glow shed by a red hat topping a dove-
grey frock. , , , .
Lord Clifton. Earl Darnley’s son and heir,
who is now seeking to uphold the family

took a second plunge last month at a London
registry-office, this time with Lady V' md-

monial ties, with Daphne Mulholland, were
snapped by a decree in 1919. The bride-
groom’s Australian mother was I lorrie

General Victor Selheim’s little wife lias

the way has been already paved. ihe
mothers, who must certify that they are
unable to foot the . bill for their own ex-
penses, will travel in batches, of !-• .. ,
scheme will not operate until 1925, which
leaves lots of time to prepare for the cam-
paign. It even leaves enough time to con-
sider whether there are not nine-and-forty
better ways of spending the money.
Maud Grantham, holiday-making in Dick-

A line or two from Adelaide: —
Pripce Alfred College staged its fete in its own
grounds at Kent Town with Lady Bridges, in black,
with wide red sleeves and a be-silvered black toque,
as its official opener. The proceeds, which were
considerable, go to the hall and new class-rooms
that are to be the college’s war memorial. Lady
Bridges opened another fete at Prospect in aid of
that suburb’s kirk, and the Kidman dame gave her
benediction to one at Unley that had the local war
memorial as its objective.
There have been a couple of young people’s con-
certs —one at Norwood in aid of the Save the Chi -
dren Fund, with Miss Whitby’s small dancing pupils
as the star performers; and another at the Wilder-
ness school, where Miss Brown’s scholars got Prot.
Darnley Naylor’s benediction for their effort to raise
funds ‘for the local babies’ home and to provide
winter fuel for the old people at the cottage
homes.
The Navy League got together a record muster of
members for its Trafalgar Day jamboree in the
Town Hall. His Ex. was on the sick list, but
Lady Bridges came and read his message, supping
afterwards with the committee. Our next Gaud
Mayor 0. R. J- Glover, who is the League s pi esi-
dent, was the host of the evening, Premier Barwell
the speaker, and officers and men from the Adelaide
and her sister ships were among the guests.
All exhibition of water-colors by Miss Denny Scott
took a goodly crowd to the May Club the other
afternoon. The Barwell dame, in smart black and
grey, said an appreciative word or two in declaring
the show open, and people racking their brains for
odds and ends to send to England for Christmas
fell thankfully upon some of the smaller sketches
of local beauty spots. ~
The Bridges went to the Burra for that flourish-
ing township’s show, which gave his Ex. a chance
of saying something about the district’s war recon
—l6OO men sent to the Front, £60,000 subscribed
to patriotic funds and £156,000 to war and peace
loans. And the Burra’s total population is I'd).
Their Exes, came back to town in time to dine
some of the officers from the visiting warships and
bid representatives of the younger generation to
dance with them afterwards.
The Weigalls are making good their promise to
k-ep an eve on Rita Coonan on the other side. She
writes of "singing at a fete at Petwood where “evi-
dently they did like my voice, for some of them
promised to be on my working committee after-
wards’’—among them Lady Carisbrook and Lady
Birkeijhead—and plans are afoot for a London con-
cert in November which Princess Beatrice and possi-
bly other Royalties will attend. Melba heard the
songstress again, and gave her letters to a teacher
of dramatic acting in Paris and to the director of
the National Opera Co.
Adelaide is at last moving its Consumptive Home
right away from the city. The former Asylum for
the Insane, alongsida the Botanic Gardens, has for
20 years been used for the purpose. Gloomy and
low-lying, it was always entirely unsuitable. Since
the war the military T.B. cases have been pleasantly
housed on a sunny hill-slope at Bedford Park, a quiet
place about six miles out; and arrangements are
being made to put the other establishment alongside
in the same conditions.

Derby Day results at Flemington are
pretty sure to work a change in the Melbourne Cup
market, which has, at time of writing, been running
on certain fixed tines for weeks. The Melbourne
Stakes should surely settle the doubt. as to Back-
wood and Fred Power. There have been so many-
handsome English horses that gave promise of
doing handsomely but were never induced to do it.
Derby form, in its bearing on the Cup outlook, is
largely a matter of Shrapnel, who shaped like a
stayer at Randwick and has the minimum weight in
the Cup. A narrow defeat of Shrapnel in a fast-
urn Derby by King Carnival or Rahiri would mean
that he would meet both on ever so much better
terms in the two-miles race. But the Spearhead
colt is reported to be giving his trainer some trouble.
The Hotham Handicap, in which King Ingoda revealed
himself last year, will next Saturday put the acid
on his stable-companion, Bitalli. Punters will not
forget that the Hotham Handicap field 12 months
ago included the three horses who were subsequently
placed in the Cup, the actual winner and the third
being the same in both races.
Among the proved and probable stayers, David is
not to be ignored, though his chance looks inferior
to those of Rapine, Heir Apparent and Sister Olive.
Thus far the mare has stood up to her work, and
her fourth _in last year’s Cup, behind three light-
weights, gives her solid claims to consideration.
Rivoli and King Ingoda are better worth backing at
liberal odds than some of the questionable stayers
at “any price you like.” Hard-and-fast adherents
of Bitalli declare that gelding, at 6st. 131 b., to he a
better thing for the Cup than was King Ingoda, at
7st. lib., a year ago. His track form, whilst under
James Seobie’s care, at Flemington, has been excel-
lent, and if he could run fourth in a Sydney Oup
when he was a three-year-old, he must be thrown into
the Melbourne Cup at 6st. 131 b. now that he is a
five-year-old with an Adelaide Tattersall’s Cup to his
credit. That is the contention. But Bitalli’s one win
up to date doesn’t prove that he is trustworthy.
He ran nowhere, with 7st. 51b, up, in the last Sydney
Cup; moreover, The Cypher, as a three-year-old, ga v e
him a year, 181 b., and a handsome beating in a 12-
furlong race at Randwick. Who will maintain that
Bitalli is a better stayer than The Cypher ? Con-
dition is the trouble with Eccles’s four-year-old ; he,
too, has been worrying his handlers. Comptroller
is another with some pretensions to be backed on
the stamina he revealed in the A.J.C. Waverley
Handicap and his light weight, yet the son of Sir
Dighton is not so attractive as Bitalli. Rapine,
Backwood, The Cypher, Sister Olive, Heir Apparent,
Bitalli and Shrapnel are selected as likely to stay
the distance. After Derby Day some of them will
have to be discarded, but at present one’s pre-
ference is for Backwood, and then Rapine.
King Carnival should win the Derby. He finished
close to the winner in the Randwick classic, and
flemington will suit him better ; also he looks more
solid than a month since. And Flying Wynne will
have a chance in the Maribyrnong Plate to con-
firm the impression she made on good judges by
her brilliant victory at Flemington four weeks earlier.
The penalty has stopped many Maribyrnong Plate
fancies in the past, but it may not stop Flying
Wynne.
When Easingwoltd had asserted his consistency by
winning the W. S. Cox Plate, at Moonee Valley,
with a nice bit to spare, from Whittier and Purser,
the query was raised as to whether he was really a
much-improved horse since this time last year, or
merely the same Easingwold a year older. He
would have won the 1922 W. S. Cox Plate but for
v loloncello; and again in the Cantala Stakes, the
Linlithgow Stakes and the Fisher Plate, at the Mel-
bourne Cup meeting, it was Violoncello that beat
him. But Westralians who saw the chestnut win the
Kalgoorlie Cup with a big weight would not touch
him at Flemington ten weeks later. They asserted
that he had lost a lot of his condition on the way
over. Since his last Spring campaign Easingwold
has never failed to run a decent race. He was second
in the Newmarket and in the Caulfield, and in his
last six tries he has never been further back than
third.
Two three-year-olds in Black Scot (Kenilworth —
Biackacre) and Valwyne (Valais —Beanbrie) showed
fair form —Black Scot in a six-furlong sprint, which
he annexed by a head, and the other in the Moonee
Valley Cup, in which she was a close second to
Princess Mernda (B’s), with the favorite, Comique,
a good third. Accarak and the Sydney horses
Note, The Epicure and Mirthmaker, shaped disap-
pointingly, but the race was a severe test of stamina,
the 13 furlongs being traversed in 2min. 44sec.
* * * *
“0.K.” ; A chance was missed when Wyn-
ette was omitted from the Melbourne Cup entries.
Thrown into the Caulfield Cup at fist. 111 b., the mare
would presumably have been let into the long race
at less than 7st., and with a penalty added she
would still have been the best-handicapped animal
in the race. Wynette’s breeding suggests stamina ;
her manner of winning the Caulfield event indicated
that another half-mile would not have been too far
for her. Certainly, she finished as though she had
greater staying power than anything near her at the
right end. Easingwold, Yacamunda, The Tyrant,
Whittier —what would Wynette have had to fear
from them over a fast two miles? Shepherd King, a
C.C. winner, finished second to Sasanof, at Fleming-
totti, after getting badly buffeted in running. Uncle
Sam was third in the Melbourne after his first
Caulfield Cup. But mares have trained on better
from- Cup to Cup than stallions or geldings. Grace
Darling, winner of the tragically sensational Caulfield
of 1885, was beaten only a head for the Melbourne
Oxenham’s. mare Acrasia, with the blood of Gaulus
and The Grafter in her heart, won the Flemington
event after running third at Caulfield. And Vanity
Fair, who looked a woman of no importance, showed
her grit by running second to The Victory for Mel-
bourne Cup after scoring third place at Caulfield.
Wynette strikes one as just the sort of mare to shine
over 16 furlongs at Flemington under a moderate
weight. But the opportunity was lest.
“Fax”: Unsophisticated grandstand punt-
ters at the Melbourne Cup meeting may be warned
against losing their money to cormorants who bet
on the outside of the “ring,” and who used to bet
“place only” until their wretched way of doing
business was prohibited by the V.R.C. committee.
These licensed occupants of valuable space now con-
fine themselves, seemingly, to laying doubles, such
as “Second and the Larst,” “Third and the Fifth,”
“Fourth and the Larst.” The object in every case
is to get in as much coin as possible before there
can be any possible call to pay out, during which
long interval .the punter who may have fluked the
first leg of the double is expected to lose his ticket
whilst drunk, or to forget he; ever had a bet, or
drop dead from natural causes. Occasionally, doubt-
less, somebody does back a double with one of these
merchants, and receives payment on his ticket —but
how he is swindled in the price! It is never more
than 40 to 1, although the field in each race is
rarely less than 15. If a punter picks the two
first favorites he makes a worse investment than if
he backed them singly on the “accumulator” prin-
ciple. If he backs long-priced starters 40 to 1 repre-
sents only a fraction of the odds that would be fair,
even at bookmakers’ prices. At totalisator prices
some of these doubles would work out at 400 instead
of 40 to 1.

“F.A.”: Zev’s defeat of Papyrus (B.
25/10/’23> should wean the English from their folly
(but it won’t, of course) of “having a fly at any-
thing.” The futility of trying to build a boat with
a cruiser’s stability and the lines of a racing yacht
has not yet dawned upon Thomas Lipton. Neither

did re-peated failures prevent the Hurlingham Polo team
from shifting a mob of ponies across the Atlantic
and expecting them to be at their best a few days
after arrival. In the case of Papyrus the change
was from grass to loose loam, from the English cli-
mate to the American, from perfect to imperfect
condition. How could a horse rocked for six days
on the stormy Atlantic be at his top three weeks
afterwards? Had a representative Australian punter
been on the course when the bags were opened he
would have put his shirt on Zev, and then departed
to some secret haunt as wet as the course and as safe
as his money.

In the Warrnambool-to-Melbourne road-
race, promoted by the Dunlop Rubber Co., 141 riders
completed the 165-miles course. The winner was
P. Wells (Malvern, Vic.), whose handicap was 56min.
and time 8.37.5. But the thickest laurels were
garnered by P. O Shea, the Maorilander, one of the
bunch of half a dozen on scratch ; for the third time
he proved himself the Australasian road champion,
cutting out the distance in 7.57.41. The Colac-to-
Melbourne 100-miles race for amateurs was won by
N. McLeod (6min.) in 4.55.22. Fastest time was
put up by S. Ramsden, whose 4.52.42 beat the
Australasian professional record for that distance.
THE CONQUEROR,.
HE: “Ai bent Anderson once, y'know!”
SHE ( incredulously ) : “You don't mean it!”
HE: “Ai do. Ai beat him in a wace to the

For want of a suitable speedway Sydney
motor-cyclists do their racing- on a cinder track
at Victoria Park. This is uncomfortable for the
spectators and dangerous for the competitors, as
was tragically shown on Saturday, when there was
an attendance of 8000. Disney, a rider from beyond
the Murray, justified the high opinion of the Vic-
torians by winning a ten-lap race (Hi miles) in
llmin f>7fsec., getting a speed of over 56 m.p.h.
from his Indian machine. Billy Oonoulty, on his
Douglas, took the Royal Handicap (5 miles 5 fur-
longs) from scratch in 5min. 4.31see. ; in his heat
he worked up to 58 m.p.h. And D. Brewster, also
riding an Indian, recorded 9min. 19sec. in winning
a nine-miles scratch event. But all three took risks,
and in the side-car race two outfits came down in
taking the last turn. When the ambulance arrived
Sid Murray, one of the drivers, was dead.
* * * •
Saturday was a black day for Australian
sport. In Melbourne Jack Dunstan, the naval heavy-
weight, died in St. Vincent’s Hospital: after a fight
with Max Gornik at the Stadium. For 15 rounds
Dunstan had held his own, but only the gong saved
him in the 16th and 17th, and the first punch in
the 18th —a right on the chin—felled him for the
count. The probabilities are that the fall did more
damage than the punch. But it is time the Law
stepped in and prohibited the stupid and brutal
20-rounder, which has been abolished in Britain and
the U.S.A. Boxing promoters should also be com-
pelled to insure their men agfiinst accident, as
jockeys are insured by the racing clubs. There have
been too many cases in Australia of poor devilk
being killed or permanently injured in the rii g,
and nothing done for the dependants beyond a per-
functory off-night “benefit,” or the hawking-round of
an ill-advertised hat.
The large crowd that remained away from
the Sydney Stadium on Saturday missed a real fight.
There has been a generous percentage of duds among
the foreign bruisers consigned to the Stadium man-
agement, but Luis Plees (9st. 91b.) deserved his
place in the crate. This he indicated as early as
the third refund, when he dropped Paul Demsky for
“nine” with a right swing. The bell saved the
Queenslander —so-called because bis parents came
from Russia, and a remote ancestor, maybe, from
the Wicklow Mountains —but he bogged in resolutely
and was on his feet at the end of the 60 minutes,
though several times punched to the canvas. There
was a roar off approval for the verdict, “Pices the
winner.” A match with Bradley' should he the
Belgian’s reward as soon as Archibald is ready.
* * * *
“FY7”: “Quarter-sheet’s” parable of
pedestrianism (B. 25/10/’23) recalls a painful inci-
dent in which a Brisbane friend of mine was impli-
cated. He had been nursing a sprinter in the usual
fashion of those days, boarding, lodging and wash-
ing the youth, with a little pocket-money on the
side. He had his eye on a big handicap at the
Exhibition, and was starting his man in a fairly
decent sprint in which he was to run the custom-
ary bye. Judge of his annoyance when he learned
that the ped. he had warmed in his bosom was about
to spike him with his own shoes, so to speak, having
been suborned by certain unscrupulous ruffians to win
the minor event. In those days, sprinters at the Exhi-
bition were locked up in little cubicles to change ;
from , these they were escorted to the track by
officials. But the faithless ped., having been locked
up, discovered that someone had abstracted his
running shoes and left a pair several sizes too large.
Appeals to the official escort, who had been “worded,”
were vain, and access to his secret backers was
impossible. The consequence was that he ran a
lumbering hundred in twelve and a half. The hurt
to my friend’s honor was healed to some extent by
his arrangement with a couple of Tommies to lay
to their limit against the gent with the canoe-like
shoes. Having collected his cut he dismissed the
perfidious ped. with the advice to mend his ways
and rid himself of the ingratitude that is sharper
than a serpent’s tooth.
C. .T. Lane (Melbourne Grammar) and
P. McM. Glynn (Xavier) have made atldetic histnrv
for their schools. Lane won the 100yds., the 220
and the 440 at the public-schools sports last year.
This year he not only repeated the performance,
but broke two records, running the 220 in 22 4-5sec.
(l-5sec. better than H. W. Neate’s time, which had
stood for 10 years), and the 440 in 50 l-5sec. —A. E.
Hartkopf’s 51sec., made 14 years ago, was the pre-
vious best. Glynn, a fine footballer and cricketer, won
boith mile and half-mile —a feat which no profes-
sional would dream of attempting—in 1922 and 1923.
His time for the latest half-mile was 2min. 4sec.
Though not “all out” —he finished 35 yards ahead
of the second man —he cut a second off the record
established in 1910 by K. Watson, who subsequently
became Australasian champion over a middle distance.
Glynn is a son of the eloquent Patrick McMahon
Glynn, one of the few remaining founders of the
Commonwealth, and South Oss has the makings of a
top-notch athlete in him.
Had the bookmakers gone to Henley-on-
the Yarra instead of to Moonee Valley (it isn’t
their habit, fortunately), they would have had a
more prosperous day. Disaster smote most of the
favorites. In the final of the Grand Challenge the
Melbourne eight made Mosman (N.S.W.) and Mer-
cantile (Vic.) feel weary—Sandy Bay and Mercantile
(Tas.) had been beaten in heats. Vv'endouree (Vic.)
dragged the Stewards’ Challenge away from the
Murray Cods, who had held it until: the barnacles
got thick on it; but Merbein partly redeemed the
reputation of Murray River rowing by landing the
Eflswick Challenge, despite the handicap of 2st. lib.
over-weight in the coxswain’s seat. Their president
Angus Poster, an aspiring youth of 67 summers,
handled the rudder lines: he still sculls in a channel
at the fruit farm. In the Murray Bridge boat were
W. H. Pfeiffer (stroke), Graetz,"Sladden and Cum-
mings, all members of the crew that won the eights
at Perth last Easter. By inflicting a two-lengths
defeat on them the Ballarat men badly damaged the
argument that the Murray Bridge eight should be
sent to Paris without demonstrating its superiority
in a preliminary test.
The spirited batting of A. G. Moyes and
R. M. Boyce gave Gordon (64 behind on the first
innings) a fine win over Western Suburbs. The pair
rattled up 136 in 62min.: Boyce’s 71 included 2
sixers and 9 fours, and in Moyes’s 81 were a sixer
and 12 fours. Itelleway’s 6. for 40 (12 for 87 in
the match) was another big factor in the victory.
Versatile Otto Nothling also hit like a giant for
Sydney Uni. v. St. George. Thanks largely to his
vigorous 124, n.o., Uni. closed their innings with
seven wickets down, and had time enough for a
first-insnngs win, but it was the closest of close
things—the last St. George wicket was taken with
what, in any circumstances, would have been the
last ball of the day.
“Centurion”: “Great Elm” (B. 25/10/’23)
is well within the mark when he hints that South
Australia’s churlish refusal to support Queensland’s
application for admission to Sheffield-shield cricket
is inspired by apprehension. South Oss, however,
is prepared to make a sporting concession. It will
not send a team to Brisbane, or even let its XI
stay on in Sydney after the match against N. S.
Wales, and meet the Bananalanders on the Cricket
Ground, with which the latter are fairly familiar
If, though, the Queenslanders are ready to trail all
the way to Adelaide, South Australia will give them
a game on Adelaide Oval, the only one on which the
Croweaters seem able to make a convincing showing'.
The Shield has been in existence for 27 seasons, and,
in that time, South Australia has only won it three
times, the last in 1912-13. Lord Sheffield provider!
for the inclusion in the competition of new States,
but left their election in the hands of the three
foundation States, which share the considerable
profits. The only available means of comparing the
recent form of Queensland ard South Australia is to
take their performances against practically the same
N.S.W. XI (Boyce’s) in 192.1-22. S.A. was defeated
by 17 runs ; Queensland won by 165.
“Winkle”: Odder than that incident at
Lord’s, wnere the off and leg stumps were skittled
and the middle one untouched (B. 18/10/’23) was
a thing that occurred at Sydney in the ’seventies.
Then Edward Gregory bowled the centre stump right
out of the ground, leaving the outside ones intact,
and the two bails still resting on top.
The year 3923 has put up a memorable
record in one department of sport, i.e., swimming
the English Channel. This summer no fewer than
three athletes, greased with crafty unguents and
tended assiduously by bottle-holders in following
craft, propelled themselves across the silver streak,
whereas in all the preceding ages (as far as is
known) only two men have accomplished the feat.
None of the three were Britishers, and the last two
managed the lob from the French coast, in consider-
ably better time than has ever previously been put
up. which suggests not so much that long-distance
swimmers are improving as that this particular test
of strength and dogged endurance is being approached
more scientifically than ever before. Probably Webb
was the first man to swim the Channel in 1875, and
yet, after all —who knows ? Some prehistoric ancient
Briton, with no other means of eseaning from his
foes or his creditors, may have done it, in the days
when watches and newspapers and bovril and brandy
and body-coatings of protective oil and all the rest
of the modern Channel-swimmer’s paraphernalia were
thousands of years away. He mightn’t have been
able to tell anyone about it, or found anvone to
believe him if he tried. All that he could do on
landing in France would have been to bless his stars
and thank his Druidical gods, and shake himself all
over like a retriever dog.
“O.McK.M.”: Melbourne Uni. Sports
Union has awarded double blues to N. F. Mitchell
and J. R. Hasker, both members of the cricket and
football groups. Nobody has equalled F. A. H. Boyn-
ton’s feat of securing full colors in cricket, foot-
ball, rowing and rifle-shooting, though F. C. Ross, one
of the stars of South Melbourne football team, last
year won recognition as an athlete, an oarsman and
a ’bailer. Pat O’Hara Wood, when at Trinity, won
his spurs in two sports. His brother Arthur went
one better —he was a rifleman as well as a cricketer
and tennis-player. Phil Le Couteur, now head of
Vic. Methodist Ladies’ College, was accepted by the
Rhodes trustees in consideration of his triple blue.
For Oxford v. Cambridge he took eight wickets in
one innings, and made a century in addition, thus
virtually winning the match for his side.
South Aus. has a real veterans’ rifle-
match, the contestants being marksmen for not less
than 40 years. Last year eight old ’uns lined up,
and this time there were 11. J. F. Le Leu won on
both occasions : but this year he had to shoot off a
tie (96 at 200, 500 and 600 yards) with G. Yeo-
mans, who started shooting in England in 1867
and was prominent in the Sandridge (Vic.) artillery
before rising to a high place in the S.A. Railways.
Yeomans is 81.
AMONG THE PONIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“About 95 p.c. of the licensed pony trainers of
Sydney were ‘stone broke’ ; a number didn’t even
have the live shillings necessary to make them finan-
cial members of the association. Between wins they
lived on each other or borrowed a few pounds from
the bookmakers.” — Kingsley, secretary <rf the Poriy
Owners and Trainers’ Association, before a Parlia-
mentary Select Committee.
Deem not the depths of want they plumb,
Those hapless figures who entreat
A copper from you or a thrum
For making music in the street,
Stuff that affronts the tympanum
And sets the nerves on edge a treat.
Poor they may be, but there are “stonies’
Stiffer than these among the ponies.
Vex not high Heaven with complaints
Merely because you find it hard
To earn a crust at pavement paints,
Or scooping bottles from a yard,
Or buzzing round with rent distraints,
Or being (like me) a minor bard,
Or blacking boots, or selling conies—
The struggle’s harder training ponies.
True, you may seldom see the oil
Of smug prosperity anoint
The wanderer where the billies boil,
The resting actor at “The Point,”
Or him who does the slushie’s toil
Back of the ninepenny eating joint.
But louder far than theirs his moan is
Who puts the polish on the ponies.
And hasn’t he cause to curse his lot
Who, when his neddy fails to score
For months on end, has always got
To cadge upon his neighbor’s store
(Assuming that it’s there) for what
Will scare the dingo from the door,
And needs must keep the books his cronies
Or starve to death among the ponies?

THE INKY WAY.
“Geo. Rich”: When Governor-General Forster de-
clared the .new Perth P.O. open our local paper
gravely chronicled that the ceremony was performed
“in the presence of a large number "of no abilities.”
London Clarion, for nearly 32 years the organ of
socialism in England, has put up the shutters. Blatch-
ford in his valedictory says: “Thirty-two years ago
we put to sea in a sieve, and during the last 10
years the sieve has not been carrying us, but we
have been carrying the sieve.” The war broke many
worse men and institutions than the Clarion.
“8.R.A.” : The unexpected arrival of the Meriones
at Newcastle caused a fever in Sydney newspaper
offices. It was the first vessel to reach Australia from
Japan since the earthquake and fire. Several reporters
rushed from Sydney ,to the northern port to hunt
for photographs. The Daily Telegraph man got in
first and bagged 15. But by the time he had gained
his prize the last train for Sydney had left New-
castle. He promptly hired a fast car, but after
a mad flight over about a. hundred miles of rough
roads it broke down some miles out of Parramatta.
He was not beaten vet: he hobbled into the old town
in time to catch the 5.30 train for the city. By
9.30 a.m. an edition of the Telegraph containing
the first Australian pictures of the chaos wrought’ in
Japan was on sale. It was good work.
Norman Freeburg, A.J.A. president in N. S. Wales,
has abandoned Common Cause, the Sydney direct-
action sheet, for a sub.’s chair on Smith’s. Free-
burg graduated on the staid old Town and Country
Journal (Sydney), and afterwards covered miles
per week in Brisbane Worker. , S. A. Rosa —-the
well of English undefiled, who for years edited
Sydney Truth, takes charge of Common Cause.
On his retirement from Truth, a few months ago,
Rosa considered the prospects of starting another
Sydney Sunday paper, Fact —-it was to give the
whole truth and nothing but the truth —but the
scheme did not mature. Rosa is no novice at ultra-
radical. journalism, having wielded a ready pen for
reform as far back as the early ’nineties. With him
ag sub. sits Arthur Rae, another of the Red Lights
of 30-odd years ago.
“Albatross”: “Hugh’s” John Norton yarn (B.
27/9/’23) recalls the experience of an old-time free-
lance who interviewed John re a permanent job.
The proprietor was exceedingly affable and con-
fessed to an appreciation of some of the applicant’s
copy he had noticed in other papers. “Your stuff’s
tiptop,” said John. “I like it. Come and see
me next week and I’ll see if I can ‘fix’ you.” The
journalist was profuse in his thanks as he shook
hands ; but his face fell a little when Norton peered
unpleasantly close into it and sniffed. “As I said
before,” pursued the potential employer, “I like
your stuff; but there’s one thing I don’t like about
you, and that’s your beery breath!” “I
can’t help that, Mr. Norton,” came the reply; “it’s
the only breath I’ve got!” “You’ll do!” growled
John.
“Randolph Rentless”: Reference to the delay in
bringing out the World, Labor’s long-promised Syd-
ney daily, was made in the course of a recent libel
action against the Daily' Mail. The scheme was
started in 1910, and in a few years the unions
subscribed £132,000 out of nominally required capi-
tal of £250,000. What was not stated, however,
was that nine years ago a skeleton staff had been
engaged, and everything was in readiness for a start.
Well, almost everything—the war came when the last
load of necessary machinery was on the water in a
German boat. Before the consignees could get it
there came the soaring newsprint shortage; and the
staff was dismissed' when the decision was reached
that no start would be made till the war was over.
Union enthusiasm seems to have almost expired now,
for, in spite of a fresh appeal for funds, only £lOO
has heen subscribed in the last three years. The
money is mostly invested in Macdonell House, a fine
city rent-producing property.
“Hertodot’s” reminiscence of a Tribune: —
The first time I met John Norton (B. 27/9/’23)
was on a Brisbane-Sydney steamer. The soi-disant
Napoleon was clad in soiled and torn trousers, ragged
undershirt and a large check cap which enveloped
most of his face; it required the united and strenuous
efforts of a crowd of retainers to get him on board
and safely stowed below. Twelve hours later he
appeared on the vessel’s main-deck apparently re-
freshed by sleep, but still wearing his bizarre cos-
tume, to the consternation of the lady passengers.
After a stroll around he made his way to the steer-
age quarters. There, after having secured a spit-
toon from the smoke-room, he dredged his trouser
pockets and produced a wad of notes from one and
a fistful of beer-bottle capsules from the other. Dis-
tributing the latter amongst the interested crowd,
he announced that he was prepared to offer the notes
as prizes for those who could toss the greatest num-
ber of capsules into the spittoon from 20 feet
away. As the onlookers included a large contingent
of racecourse parasites, there was a blackguard rush
to secure capsules, in the course of which Norton
was nearly pushed overboard. Several fights
started over the conditions of the competition, and
soon a mild riot was in progress. At this stage
the captain, a husky six-footer, and a gorilla-necked
mate chipped in, and Norton cursed them both
with great fervor and unction. Totally unimpressed
by the luxuriance of the diction, the mate, at a
signal from the old man, picked up John as though
he were a babe and carried him, struggling, kicking
and blaspheming, to his cabin. He lay very low for
the remainder of the trip.
THE HIGHBROWS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O poets of class and of status,
Whom erudite critics attest
As dowered with celestial afflatus,
Of genius glowing possessed,
Entranced by your glittering phrases,
I own that I’ve frequently been,
But I find myself groping in mazes
When I try to decide what the blazes
It is that you mean.
You sing, and anon panegyrics
On heads of each other you heap ;
There’s music, one feels, in your lyrics
That ripple and gurgle and leap;
You have quaffed Hippocrene for your potion,
There isn’t a shadow of doubt;
Your sonnets are tense with emotion,
Though I seldom can hit on a notion
Of what they’re about.
Your flowers are a trifle obtrusive,
Your colors are gorgeous and rare,
But most of the rest is elusive —
If there’s more that you meant to be there.
The peaks of Parnassus your eyes on,
With shadowy problems you clinch
In words that bedeck and bedizen.
But where is the mental horizon
You widen an inch?
Is subtlety characteristic
Of the Georgian bard and his lay ?
Or are you so cryptic and mystic
Because you have nought to convey ?
E’en Browning, in whom there abounded
Expressions that puzzle and rasp,
Whenever dissected and sounded,
At least some ideas propounded
A fellow can grasp.
Is it Celtic, this bardic incursion
In mystery’s tangled demesne?
This vehement, rabid aversion
To speech that is Saxon and plain?
Oh, brows superciliously wrinkling,
Brows twined with the laurel and bay,
.How many, d’you think, have an inkling
Of what in your cadences tinkling
You’re trying to say?

(Ice-less)
No matter where you livo
you can have this plant. For
those who have no electric cur-
rent available we supply a
LISTER petrol engine, or
arrangements can be made to
couple up the plant to any
power you have available.
Soft-drink dispensers, hotel-keepers, club stewards, butchers and others
handling food and drink, besides housekeepers generally, have hitherto
depended on melting ice for keeping things in palatable condition, 13U 1
Producing cold by melting ice is wasteful, expensive and insanitary.
Mechanical refrigeration avoids these faults—hence its universal use for
commercial cold-storage plants. , . ,
The “D.G.” REFRIGERATOR is a household-size, mechanical cold-
producer. It is simple, safe, efficient and cheap to operate —the only running
expense being the power to drive the plant two or three hours aaily. the
“D.G.” works on the “ammonia-compression” system, which is recognised by
experts as the best form of mechanical refrigeration yet tried, and is the one
used in practically every commercial and ship s plant. The manner in which
this system is applied in the “D.G.” Refrigerator is approved by leading
engineers. . ,
The “D.G.” not only supplies a long-felt want, but must soon be accepted
as an indispensable part of the domestic equipment. Already the demand has
exceeded our expectations. Write now for illustrated leaflet if you wisn to

“Tons of Money,” a fast and furious farce-
comedy, imported from the London Shaftes-
bury, was paid out at the new Palace in
Melbourne on Saturday night, under a run-
ning fire of chuckles from an overflowing
audience. The three-decker, which was built
up by Will Evans and Arthur Valentine,
tears along at express speed, without once
skidding off the rails of the neatly-constructed
plot. The chief laughter-makers are a young
inventor, Aubrey Allington, and his even
more inventive little French wife. The pair
are discovered facing the awful blue-writted
consequences of a Rolls Royce life on a Ford
income. But things proceed to ginger up
with a fat legacy for Aubrey, which in the
event of his demise passes to Cousin George
in Mexico. The latter being conveniently
listed as shot dead, the French daughter of
Eve tempts her weaker half to diddle his
creditors by bequeathing the wealth to her
before vanishing in the smoke of an explo-
sion in his laboratory, the idea being that he
shall resurrect himself later in the likeness
of the defunct George. The plot matures,
but, the butler having readjusted the clock
hands, Mrs. Aubrey fires the fuse before
hubby has time to get away. A fine first
curtain discloses the wretched inventor in a
dreadful condition of wreckage after the
blow-up. Disguised with a goatee and an
American burr, he returns home—to he con-
founded by a second Yankee-tongued and
goatee-chinned George. And so the compli-
cations proceed, until the story unwinds it-
self in a final curtain.
“Tons of Money” brings Dorothy Brunton
back to us; and the uproarious greetings on
Saturday held the show up for some minutes.
As Aubrey’s giddy French wife, Dot showed
her old form. Her endearing spontaneity has
in no wise diminished : she still throws her-
self into her part in the old hoydenish way.
Her Louise, who tearfully boasts that her
husband, gives her everything credit will buy,
is a typical English girl, fresh, pleasing and
natural, despite a superabundance of foreign
accent and gesture. The lengthy farceur,
Charles Heslop, who comes here with a big
London reputation, is apt to be a shade too
tireless. Slick of ’" T e and tongue and limb,
he is temperamentally and technically equip-
ped for his job. But one tires a little of his
incessant juggling—with words and limbs
and everything else he has to use. As the
real George’s devoted widow, who recognised
her hubby in all three holders of the name
by the way they kissed, Sylvia Shaw is
always in the picture, although her work is
rather academic. Andrew Higginson is the
pretender, and Douglas Calderwood gave an
excellent account of himself as the real
cousin from Mexico. Charles Road Knight.
Emma Temple and a newcomer, Maidie Field,
completed the fine cast.
“IRIS," AT SYDNEY ROYAL.
Frederick Maldonado, (Oscar Asche) turns
Iris (Diana Wilson) into the street
and smashes up the flat.
The Melbourne public is flocking—in
moderation —to see Howett Worster as the
dashing highwayman Macheath, with his
Lucy and his Polly and his retinue of lesser
loves. Good as the rest may be, Worster
dominates “The Beggar’s Opera” by virtue
of a fat part and an unsuspected ability to
quite fill it. Jack Cannot, who lias intro-
duced sundry cheap modern gags in his
otherwise excellent rendering of the rogue
i eachum, should have his unseemly innova-
tions severely stamped out. And pretty
folly should cease from trifling with her
diction in some of her ravishing vocal num-

season at Her Majesty’s the Sydney Reps,

Pretty Peggy fluttered off the Melbourne
1 nncess s perch on Friday night to make
way for a fresh consignment of “Rockets,” in
which Charles Austin, the Pounds sisters

Melbourne friends and admirers before going
on to Sydney. This will leave the Prin-
cess s to Allan Doone, who will unpack a
new Irish production,. “The Young Gossoon.”
Incidentally, Lorna Pounds is contemplating
a breakaway to the dramatic stage, leaving
Toots to try her luck behind the comic-opera
footlights.

Belinda continues her flirtatious way at
Melbourne King’s, and as no hint of a change
of shows has been
released, Irene
Vanbrugh will keep
on juggling with
her three admirers.
The story that
Milne wrote the
play round the
lady is an easy one
to believe; but one
would never sus-
pect the writer of
fitting out Dion
Boucicault as a
hard-headed busi-
ness man with a
passion for statis-
tics. The part of
Baxter sags on
Dion like a hand-
me-down, and, evi-
dently realising it,
he is forever striv-
ing to smooth out
the creases. Janet
Eccles continues to
be an attractive
young thing, but
she overworks the

At Melbourne
Royal “Sally” is
still demonstrating
tli e impossibility
of keeping a good
girl down, even
though she is only
a dish-bather; and

Walter Kirby’s silvery tenor was in the
pink of form for the first of his Melbourne
Cup concerts, and the Town Hall house —a
rather thin one—bubbled over with an en-
thusiasm which knew no difference between
the best and the worst items. Asa lyric
tenor,_ Walter Kirby deserves the, sweetest
adjectives in the flapper’s lexicon; but to
harness him to heavyweight stuff is like put-
ting a Cup winner in a brewer’s van. Yet
Walter is to be commended for his nice
sense of showmanship, which guards him
against the pitfall of monotony. At this
first concert he covered a wide field with
generally excellent results ; but in one item
well out of lyric range, and which
he warbled with eyes fearfully glued
to the MSS. clutched in his hand,
he was frankly not in his element. A
grand-opera number earned every ounce of
the applause which followed; but it was
in soul-stirring ballads, in French, Italian
and English, that he ravished his hearers as
usual. His perfect diction is a thing to
cherish, and his art has increased 'in in-
tensity since he jettisoned his sob note for
a more subtle form of appeal. Phyllis
Hazell, who owns a full-toned soprano of
rather hard quality but with some amazing
contralto notes, revealed temperamental vir-
tues in “The Lament of Isis,” and a poor
sense of values in an encore number —a giddy
little coon song, which fitted neither her voice
nor the occasion. William Burrell, whose
injured thumb is now on the mend, earned
honorable mention for his unobtrusive but
delightful accompaniments

“Pygmalion,” with Mrs. Pitt Rivers as
leading lady, will arrive at Her Majesty’s on
November 13, and stay for the three follow-
ing nights, with a matinee on Thursday. All
the best people are, of course, supporting the
season, which was primarily designed to
swell the Queen Victoria Hospital funds.
lhe whole of the matinee takings will go
to that cause; the evenings’ harvest will be
divided up between the Hospital, the Sick
Actors’ Fund and the Repertory movement.
\ ice-royalty will smile on the first night and
the matinee, the J.C.W. Co. is looking after
the theatre arrangements, and Boucicault
will throw in some recitations.

Wirths’ circus and menagerie is still the
best show in Melbourne for any deserving child
to take its parents to. It is an adequate con-
necting link between the old and the new in
sawdust and spangles, tights and horseflesh
being blended with the latest inventions in
breath-taking daredeviltry. At last Satur-
day’s matinee Prince Giuseppe Bigongi made
his bow. There are plenty of infants who
can beat this artist for bulk, but he packs
inside his pygmy soul-case enough nerve for a
battalion, and cheerfully bounces on and off
galloping horses, although the beasts must, to
one of his size, measure up as big as ele-
phants. Alfred Clarke, an English acro-
batic jockey, makes the impossible seem ordi-
nary, and Evans and Perez treat all laws of
gravitation with contempt from either end of
a 30-foot pole. Loud applause goes to the
performing dogs; but the prize for beauty is
so easily the warthog’s that all other entries
are withdrawn.

An adaptation of Robert Chambers’s best
seller, “The Common Law,” provides the
week’s thrill at Hoyt’s, in Melbourne. It
depicts a charming and nicely brought-up
damsel driven to earn her crust as an
artist’s model in the hectic atmosphere of a
N’York studio, and emerging from the ordeal
unblighted. “The Common Law” is followed
by that even more powerful hair-raiser, “The
Tiger’s Claw,” in which Jack Holt and Eva
Novak get the biggest headlines. “Grand
Larceny” is the Majestic’s long suit. This
points no particular moral but tells a stir-
ring tale—all about a flirtatiously inclined
damsel, and it has a refreshingly unusual
final curtain. When the thrill has died down
the house is cheered up with the latest J. J.
Bell yarn, “Macgregor’s Sweetheart,” which
is a sandwich of love and laughs. Betty Bal-
four—Mary Pickford’s serious rival —is en-
gaging as Macgregor’s best girl.

“A Southern Maid,” which has arrived at
last at Her Majesty’s, in Sydney, appeals
more to the eye than to the ear or the under-
standing. A critic who has had a bad day
at the races might object that the humor is
unsatisfying in quantity and quality, and
that, instead of the dramatic thrill which the
audience has a right to expect when the
Latin-American heroine, being the inheri-
tress of a vendetta in good going order, is
presented with (1) a lethal weapon and
(2) instructions to destroy Sir Willoughby
Rawdon, her lover, there is the preposterous
anti-climax of a comic hold-up. But no
one can complain that it hurts him to look
at swart Cliilenos, Castilians or Cubans in
the picturesoue costumes of their country,
whatever it is, or at English yachting girls
in colored wigs and ravishing panta-
loons, or at the market-place, the cafe
and the orange grove in which the plot
is unfolded. The thing is sumptu-
ously colorful; indeed. Asche, who produces
it, the Colemans, who painted the scenes,
and the Londoner who designed the costumes
share the honors with Gladys Moncrieff.
That excellent young Queenslander —a some-
what ampler Gladys than when she was last
in Sydney—has never been seen in a part
that suited her better. The impression she
produces, as never before, is that there are
temperament, personality and brains in her
eouipment, as well as a beautiful voice.
When she thanked the first-night audience “on
behalf of my company,” one felt that she
had earned the right to discard the distin-
guishing adjective for the proud personal
pronoun. Claude Flemming is also very
effective as a melodramatic rascal, with
humorous moments, and the convincing band
of cut-throats associated with him in the
vendetta are headed by a noticeable figure,
Neville Towne. Sir Willoughby’s songs are
sung in an agreeable fashion by Robert
Chisholm, whose acting is very uneven—
sometimes stiff and awkward, sometimes sur-
prisingly forcible. Acceptable work is also
done by Arthur Stigant. William Greene,
Reg Purdell, Dorothy Purdell and Clarice
Hardwicke.

At Sydney Theatre Royal, Oscar “Maldon-

malevolence incarnate, a huge spider weav-
ing the web in which Diana “Iris” Wilson’s
pretty feet are to be hopelessly entangled.
The final curtain-fall on 2cwt. of impotent
fury is a revelation in dramatic possibilities.
“The O’Brien Girl” is in her seventh

no visible abatement in her lure.

“Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife” has another
eight nights to run at Sydney Criterion. On
Saturday week “Joseph Entangled” will
arrive with Lawrence Grossmith. It is a
comedy written by Henry Arthur Jones
nearly 20 years ago dealing with the scandal-
mongers of London’s Smart Set of the period.
At Sydney Tivoli Ada Reeve will con-
tinue to deliver the goods with the London
mark on them for another week —the singer
of “When Richard the First Sat on the
Throne” was never in better voice or more
ebullient spirits. Harrington Reynolds is
a bright and pleasing patter-merchant, and
the Hanlon Bros, do some clever and rather
novel pantomiming in “The Haunted Hotel,”
while the gods look with favor on that vast
and bouncing piece of femininity who appears
on the bills and the quivering boards as
Juno Mills. But, saving always Ada the
Inimitable, there is no performer who com-
pels more admiration that Creighton, the
Fidgety Genius. His juggling is a triumph
of skill and dexterity.

“The Covered Waggon” is pursuing a
rough trail across Sydney Crystal Palace
screen. A better-than-average story, it de-
picts a little of the hardships that the Ameri-
can western pioneer found himself up
against-—though Heaven knows why we
should go to Uncle Sam for that sort of
thing. Lyceum clients are being introduced
to that immaculate and reckless young agony-
column advertiser, “Bulldog Drummond,” and
almost all favor his nonchalance and dare-
devilry. The additional film at the same
house is also good. Betty Balfour, Eng-
land’s premier screen comedian, is the star,
and is very nearly at her best. >To round
off a good programme, there are pictures of
the Japanese holocaust. The Strand pre-
sents “The Tiger’s Claw,” wherein a jilted
Romeo flies to India to forget, and is saved
from all sorts of horrors by the lady who
previously handed him his pass-out check.
Within the same house Clara Kimball Young
plays the prima donna in “Enter Madam” in
a capital manner. At the Globe “Bobin
Hood” robs the rich to pay the poor—a noble
impulse that is lost upon Fagin’s gang in
“Oliver Twist” at Hoyt’s.

From an Adelaide critic:—
Lionel Lindsay is having a one-man show at
Preece’s Gallery, and paying a long visit to Hans
Heysen’s country studio meanwhile. The water-colors
are nearly all in his now familiar Spanish style.
The etchings, too, are characteristic; and most
interest centres in the woodcuts. Sales are numer-
ous. Van Raalte opened the show, and Lindsay took
the opportunity to say a few words for the stay-at-
home Sydney artists, with a rap for those travelled
rivals who join the Chelsea (London) Art Club in
belittling Australian work.

Adelaide Royal has been filling in time
with a Frolics party, in which Colin Crane’s
singing and Clem Dawe’s resolute fooling
take the attention most. The management
might cut out the Ninon de L’enclos song.
It was strong stuff in its original setting, as
sung by the lurid lady herself in the French
Court scene of “As You Were” ; as offered
by a nice girl, apropos of nothing, in a con-
cert programme, it is a needless offence.

The Majestic has a stronger variety bill, be-
cause varied by athletic turns, Mello and
Nello being prominent; the same thing ap-
plies, at the Prince of Wales, to Belle Marie
and the Charlberts. In pictures, the leading
feature of the moment is a film version of
“The Bohemian Girl” at West’s, with the
Marble Halls and other ballads sung by a
lady billed as Vera Thrush.

THE FACE POWODER
‘‘Caesar's Ghost”: The movie finger lias
written an order for the remodelling of the
Lyric, Sydney’s first picture-house, and for a
time the biggest cinema theatre in the world
—America in those days was satisfied with
relatively humble affairs. J. D. Williams,
afterwards boss of the First National, called
the structure into being in 1910; now
£40,000 is to be, spent in converting it into
the Lyric Winter Garden Theatre, with all
the latest Prohibition!and improvements, ex-
cept that there will be no hooch in the milk-
chocolate. Other changes are occurring in
the world of animated shadows. But there
is no sign of these wealthy companies set-
ting to work on the manufacture of Austra-
lian films, although the Tariff Board protests
that it is taking the matter up.
“Muljarra”: “Dot” Brunton, the adorable
little Aussie who has come back to star for
Hugh J. Ward in “Tons of Money,” at
Melbourne Palace, has a long-endurance
admirer somewhere in the hinterland of
Cook, one of the “stations” on the Trans,
line. He is always on hand to feast his
eyes on his divinity when she crosses the
continent, although lie has to ride about 100
miles to do it. When Dot was on her way
to Blighty in 1921 he insisted on presenting
her with a bale of wliite-dingo pelts which
he had tanned himself. They proclaimed
their doggy odor so opulently, however, that
Dorothy was obliged to have them labelled
“Not wanted on voyage,” and stowed away
in the bottom of the hold. A curious feature
of the desert idyll is that this Corydon of
the, open spaces worshipped Dot long before
he met her. He had collected a sheaf of
newspaper and magazine pictures of her, yet
the first time she walked past him on the
Cook station he did not recognise her, and it
was by the merest chance that he discovered
that he was actually within hand’s reach of
his idol. His vociferous “Gorblimey”
wrung the withers of the welkin, and made
even the listless passengers sit up and stare.
“Jacky Roo” : Alfred Hill is composing
tlie music for Hugh McCrae’s “The Ship of
Heaven,'’ and promises the complete opera in
a few months. “The Ship” has been floating
about for a year or so waiting for Arthur
Benjamin to do the score, but Benjy was
too busy with pianoforte work. Hill has
manned “The Ship” with enthusiasm, and
says it will have a successful voyage.
“Hamfat” on stage strikes: —
The strike of stage-hands in Melbourne reminds
me of a show in which the chief mechanist (and
part-proprietor) was quite frequently on strike. His
assistant liked beer, too, and they usually went on
strike together. When well stung, Scenes would grow
morbidly introspective, and remember as slights the
disinclination of ladies of the co. to regard him as
a man and a cousin. The refusal of Horatio Hamfat,
the leading man, to join him in a drink, and other
insults of the kind, would also be brooded over
until red revolution broke out, the gore spurting
from noses with which fists had come violently into
contact. Then Scenes would be thrown out of
the stage-door, with the loyal assistant. Contrition
came swiftly. Pathetic thoughts of ill-hung scenery
would surge in the mechanist’s soul. In his peni-
tence he would become importunate, and, to pre-
vent his going round to the front of the house
and pleading from the back-stalls I to be allowed
to do his work, he Was usually readmitted, after
being kept parleying at the door until the show
was nearly over. This precaution was neglected one
night with unhappy results. As the hero was declaiming
to the heroine, who had come to . visit him in his
cell, about the merciless strength of his prison
walls, the said walls quivered, fell apart, and dis-
closed two trousered legs. They were the legs of
the over-zealous Scenes, who, being disgusted with
the way the scenery had been put up, had resolved
to pull it to pieces and erect it afresh. It was
merely rotten luck which impelled him to do it at
this moment.
“E.T.” : That Rod Page article on Leonard
Merrick (B. 25/10/’23) recalled to my mind
a slight young man with a pale face and.
deeply sunken eyes who “walked-on” with
me in a long-forgotten play by Henry Arthur
.Tones, “The Noble Vagabond,” at London
Princess’s, in the year—well, never mind.
Merrick did not stay long on the boards—l
don’t remember him getting beyond “walk-
ing gentlemen” and “understudies” ; but his
stage experience served him well when he
started writing. In addition to his many
novels he is the author of several plays—
three of them written in collaboration with
George R. Sims—but none had the charm
of his books or were half as successful,
though Merrick once quaintly described him-
self as “an unsuccessful novelist.” If all
readers were of my mind, he would be their
favorite author.
“G.A.C.”: Frank Russell’s “Harwood
Blood,” which went up at London Kings-
way just before tin l last English mail left,
does not seem likely to make a name for
Australian drama in London. The Times,
while giving it a fair-sized notice, does not
even bother to mention the author’s name.
It says, however, that the first act, which
takes place in Alaska, is “rich in color,”
and that the various performers “made the
best of what would probably be a successful
film story.” Evidently the Repertory
Players judged it differently: they wouldn’t
be likely to produce what they thought a
mere potboiler.
“Patrick”: Sydney conductor Alfred Hill
has surely carved more air than any other
man of his age. He was only 15 when he
was engaged as conductor of the orchestra
of Wilson and Majeroni’s Opera Co. for the
Christchurch and Dunedin (ALL.) season;
and that was 37 years ago.

A RTIST ( nervously ) : “She’s got to have an-
other coat on yet!”
DEALER ( brutally ) : “And you might chuck

“Bouragi” : “Te Babarantiko” lias a dig
at Hurley for the ridiculous claims credited
to him in the advertisements of his latest
series of Papuan pictures. Still, the blame
may lie less with the enterprising little chap
than with the advertising fiends employed to
boost his show. Villainous ignorance of their
subjects' seems to be the outstanding cliarae-
teristic of these gentry. I am thinking at
this moment of a giant poster ad. on the
back pages of the evening papers. It is an
announcement of a picture depicting the
“overlanding” by waggon trains to the Cali-
fornia goldfields of 1849, and the traditional
attacks by Indians. In the foreground of
the ad. is a mounted Indian brave clasping
a modern .44 Winchester rifle; and the
earliest Winchester didn’t arrive until 1804.
“G.A.C.”: Brisbane is having its last
theatrical kick prior to gettiug down to sum-
mer. Grossmith’s will probably be the last
show at His Majesty’s until March or so next
year. He did only fair business with Apple-
jack—audiences enthusiastic but thin. Nellie
Bramlcy is in her last nights at the Royal,

THE AOTOR : “I feel uncomfortable —as
though I’d left something behind at the
theatre.”
HIS FRIEND : “Probably a bad impression.”
playing “Little Lord Fauntleroy,” and soon
the only permanent dramatic house in .Bris-
bane is to be given over to musical comedy—
“So Long, Letty,” etc. The city picture
shows are doing well, but not so well as those
in the suburbs, which are crowded during the
two or three nights a week they are open.
They are all more or less open-air, with can-
vas chairs and permission to smoke; and if
you can watch Mary Bickford with the river
breeze curling round your ears, it isn’t likely
that you are going to toil into town to sit
on red plush in a steam-batli.
“Pollardian” adds his testimony:—
May Beatty (B. 4/10/’23) was certainly the
cleverest actress in our old co. I was in the. chorus
and doomed to stay there (sang tolerably well, but
couldn’t act a bit), and we all regarded May as
versatility itself. Her best part was La Poupee.
Cecil Lawrence, who stage-managed the London,
Australian and M.L. productions of that opera, con-
sidered her “doll’’ the most wonderful performance
he had ever seen. I remember well the opening
night of “Falka,” at Auckland. We were all ready
to start, when Marion Mitchell, who was to play
the name-part, suddenly lost her voice—speaker’s
throat —and couldn’t utter a sound. May Beatty
knew the music, but not a line of the dialogue.
Pollard went on and explained the situation, offer-
ing to return the money or to substitute any other
opera in our list. Nobody left. The audience voted
for “The Gondoliers,’’ and we put it on just as
we were, in our “Falka” rigs. I never saw any-
thing so grotesque, but the house enjoyed it. By
degrees we drifted off to change, and before the end
of the first act we were all Gondoliers again. That
was Saturday night. May spent what was left of
it and all day Sunday swatting her lines and
rehearsing. By Monday night Marion Mitchell had
recovered her voice, but Pollard decided to let May
stick to the part. In it she made one of the
biggest hits of her life. Willie Percy played Arthur
to her Falka; poor Harry Quealy was Tancred.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: A Danish inventor is
alleged to have produced a talking-film in
which the voice perfectly synchronises with
the action on the screen. There have been
many attempts to remove the silence from
the silent drama. Even Australia, where
these innovations take some time to arrive,
was introduced years ago to a film with a
phonograph attachment. Unfortunately the
arrangement worked so badly that the hero
could be heard demanding that the villain
should unhand the girl just as he was galloping
madly over 200 miles of sagebrush desert to
rescue her from a fate worse than death. It
broke down altogether when the auxiliary
villain, having been shot by the chief male-
factor, started to make his confession when
the film itself was showing what happened a
month after his funeral. I am sceptical of
that Danish report.
“Wilson Hill,” from California: —
A delectable trifle called “Getting Gertie’s Garter
got something else after running 90 days in Los
Angeles. It was hauled up before a beak, who
called it lewd, and fined most of the participants
50 dollars, though two of the ladies were let off
with half that penalty. Westralian Marjorie Bennett
and Gwen Burroughs were members of the co. Mar-
jorie made a brief, dramatic speech about Yankee
freedom, and vowed, amid tears, to catch the first
boat back to Australia.
“Cobba-Cobba”: Townsville (N.Q.) lias
just given a cyclonic reception to a "polite
vaudeville” co. from the effete South. So
insistent became the “bird” that the manage-
ment put on a couple of muscular silencers,
and they were kept busy. For suggesting that
the gent, who sang “I’m the Stoker” should
go back to his predestined implement, the hre-
shovel, three critics were shown the door. But
ic took a lot of persuasive eloquence to get rid
of a Greek waiter, whose Hellenic pride was
hurt by a Dago jazz song. He insistently
demanded the return of “me one and da
sixapence.” A converging movement on the
part of the chucker-out corps decided him to
let “da dam’ robba keepa da. mon.”
“F.A.” : Manifestly an “and” was omitted
from the statement that Patrick
“played minor roles with Julius Knight in
‘Ben Hur’” (B. 18/10/’23). After a year
or two at Otago Uni. Patrick hung out
his sign as a toothsmitli in The Octagon.
Dunedin. He came across to Sydney at the
instance of Reynolds Denniston, another
Dunedinite, and joined J. Knight as a super.
He did good work as Tresliam in “The Breed
of the Treshams.” Jerome was a natural
elocutionist, and his sound education was an
asset, but he lacked versatility. This it was
that limited his usefulness and made his
“rests” long and frequent.
“O. McKay M.” : The two dainty Conser-
vatorium lassies had just soared to the last
high c. “Did you like our duet, Monsieur
Patapon?” inquired Betty of the French
visitor. “Ah, Ma’m’selle” —and the Gaul’s
eyes sought the stars in rapture—“eet was
beautiful, exquise, wonn-deer-fool! Ze duet,
it was superbe. Only one way would I like
you more better, and zat it is in ze singlet!”
“Wink”: A most accommodating name for
a Sliakspearean actor is Augustus. In the
portrayal of characters full of dignity and
circumstance, such as Claudius, King of Den-
mark. what could read better on the pro-
gramme than “Augustus Neville”? Or apter
than this for a comic or villainous part:
"Autolycus (a rogue), Gus Neville”?
“Orb” : “J.F.11.” (B. 25/10/'23) stirs old
memories of the carbonaceous pigment days.
Billy Emerson it was who brought the Cogill
brothers here in the ’eighties-—by the way.
they were Friday and Tuesday Afternoon in
one of the Firm’s pantos. Another member
of Emerson’s co., baritone Alf Holland, is
still in Sydney; he was Cerberus for Walter
Bentley’s late unlamented Actors’ Associa-
tion. Tom Buckley, too, was, until recently,
one of Alleh Doone’s bhoys.
“Second Murderer”: When on tour with
Alfred Dampier in ’96 we bumped “King”
Cole at Quirindi (N.S.W.), where he had a
tent and was pulling teeth and cheap-jacking
elixirs and such. Dampier reckoned the
opposition so strong that he asked Cole to
close down for the night and give us a chance.
This the long-haired hustler did, and Dam-
pier publicly thanked him for being a sport.
“T. 0.1.”: I heard Coppin make that
“gas” speech (B. 25/10/’23). He had
patched up his quarrel with G. V. Brooke,
and the latter was appearing with him in
“The Honeymoon,” by Tobin —G.Y.B. was
the Duke and Coppin the Mock Duke. The
speech, a long one, was delivered in the Mock
Duke’s habiliments.
“Flyman” ; Larry Foley (B. 11/10./’23)
wasn’t only an actor: he had a lease for a
time of the Gaiety Theatre, Sydney, meta-
morphosed from the R.C. Guild Hall. It
never made a fortune for Larry or anyone
else as a theatre, but Charlie Campbell, a
contemporary of Foley’s in the pugilistic
business, did pretty well by turning it into
a boxing joint. Just now it is the Southern
Cross Hall, with the Catholic Club in the
“flies.” In its Guild Hall days Gracie
Plaisted, the Vivians and other mummers,
now almost forgotten, played in it. I shall
never forget Larry’s outburst when his last
tenants left owing the rent, and he found
he couldn’t even “close” on Jerry Mahony’s
drums.
“Lond.”: A lot of old-time musical suc-
cesses have just been set free by George
Dance (B. 11/10/’23) for the use of ama-
teur players. They include “A Chinese
Honeymoon” and “The Lady Slavey,” both
immensely popular in their time; also “Ma
Mie Rosette” (never so much thought of in
England as in Australia), and more recent
work like “Miss Hook of Holland,” “Our
Miss Gibbs” and “Kissing Time.”
“Stallite” : Apropos of Jerome Patrick (B.
18/10/’23), Brisbane theatregoers had the
novel experience of seeing him on the screen
and in the flesh during the same week. The
spoken play was “Daddies,” the photo-play
“Three Men and a Girl,” in which he ap-
peared with Marguerite Clark.
THE PURISTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Even the revised version of ‘The Beggar’s Opera,’
presented at Her Majesty’s, Melbourne, on Caulfield
Cup night made the audience flinch and gasp occa-
sionally ; and this was no light accomplishment, especi-
ally as some of them were very obviously drunk.”
—The Australasian.
A classic play? Allowed.
But this exacting crowd,
Whose brows wou.d hardly cloud
At the most gaudy
Lingerie and leg display,
Found eighteenth- century Gay
Improper—shall we say?—-
Or (frankly) bawdy.
They would have watched serene
The Frencheut bedroom scene ;
Maids moved to smile have been
And men to chuckle;
The naughtiest revue
Would have embarrassed few
Of them. But this was too
Close to the knuckle.
Iler face behind her fan
Full many a woman ’gan
To hide—and many a man
In stalls and boxes
Gasped and seemed like to elioke-
As on their minds it broke
The stage was packed with folk
Like thieves and doxies.
E’en devotees of Horse
Flinched and turned pale perforce,
Commenting sourly “Coarse!'’
Or muttering “Risque!”
While hardened bookies frowned
And made the sort of sound
That means disgust profound
(On top of whisky).
A house that might have viewed
N. Lindsay’s nudest nude
And chanced on nothing rude
Enough to shock it,
Its head) in horror hung
At names that are among
Those at Poll, lVac hum flung
And Lucy Lockit.
Well, ’tis'n’t my affair.
At least the author's where
He cannot turn a hair
Or care a copper
That punters aft’r a day
At Caulfield found his play
Immoral —shall we, say?—
Or just improper.

IF YOU want to look your best, you
must be properly corseted—for no
woman ever looked well, or felt well
or appeared to the best advantage, if she
was wearing the wrong corset.
Is the corset you have on perfectly com-
fortable ? Does it exactly fit your figure ?
Or does it “ride up” on your body and
bulge the flesh at the waist, or push up
under the arms, or dig into your legs or do any of those distracting
things that make you uncomfortable and tire you out and give you
that “corseted look that adds years to your apparent age?
When you buy a corset you want one that is comfortable,one that
will make most of the natural grace of your figure, one that will
wash well and wear well, one that will protect your health and fter-
nally guard you against the injustice of looking older than you are.
Buy a Gossard Corset
Twenty years ago Mr. Gossard discovered in Paris a new kind of
corset a corset that laced in front, designed for herself by a
French Countess, the Countess Fould de Grasse. Because this
new principle in corsetry offered a protection to the health as well
as to the appearance, Mr. Gossard introduced it to the feminine
world, and the practical artistry of Gossard designers has devel-
oped it to its present perfection. Your own family physician will
agree with other undisputed medical authorities that the front lac-
ing Gossard is the only corset that will give you ideal support.
This matter of designing for your type is the whole secret.
Gossard artists, after studying thousands of women, classified them
into nine figure groups and created special models to take care of
the particular figure needs of each group. There are Gossard Cor-
sets created with just the support you need at your age and weight
to give you the proper proportions of the type to which you be-
long. Your Gossards will be differently proportioned and differ-
ently boned from the corsets created for the other figure groups.
Perhaps you have been buying your corset by waist measure alone.
That is a fatal mistake and one of the most common causes of cor-
set discomforts. If you want an exactly-right
corset, one that will always he comfortable,
one that will never need “breaking in,” all
you need do is to select a Gossard designed
for you. It is sure to fit you perfectly and
be absolutely comfortable every minute you
have it on.
Go to the Best Store You Know
Do you realise for how little you can buy
these comfortable, graceful, sensible, beautiful Gossard Corsets?
You can get one for as little cost as the ordinary corset. But no
matter what you pay, the Gossard corsetiere who fits you will
know types as well as corsets and will guarantee your satisfaction.
Gossard Brassieres
Gossard Brassieres like Gossard Corsets are designed for the needs
of the nine figure groups. The new Longerlyne models are priceless
to the woman who heretofore has been unable to find brassieres wich
special shaping to support and flatten the diaphragm and with extra
length to prevent them from slipping up over the lower tops of
the modern corsets. Yet they are most reasonably priced within
the reach of every purse.

Miss Eleanor Gray, the Gossard Corset Specialist, whose years of

Dorothy’s Dilemma
(By “Phlox.”)
WHY over don’t you bring him up
to the scratch, Dorothy?”
“Oh, aunt, how can you talk
like that?”
“Well, my dear, one must be practical
these days. You’re the eldest of the family,
and you’ve never yet been engaged. There’s
May and Edna married and Babs engaged,
and now that you have a nice man paying
you attention, you don’t do your part to-
wards leading up to a proposal. Don’t you
care for Jack Hutton?”
■'Tes, aunt. I’m just crazy about him.
But I can’t ask him to marry me.”
“All the same, I do think you might give
him a little more encouragement. But who
knows? The spirit may move him to propose
at the dinner-dance at the Wentworth to-
morrow night. You must look your best,
Dorothy.”
“I only wish I was as lovely as Mrs.
Merton.”
“Mrs. Merton is very beautiful, but I don’t
know that she is the best companion for a
girl. I hear that all young men are in
love with her. She’ll fascinate Jack Hutton,
if you’re not careful. They say she was
the cause of Mary Fletcher’s engagement
being broken off.”
"Mere idle gossip, aunt. A woman can’t
help being fascinating.”
The Wentworth Cafe was all gaiety and
brightness; the softly-shaded lights throw-
ing a glamor over everything. In the
beginning of the evening, Dorothy had en-
joyed herself; now she felt that the sun
would never shine again for her. Jack
Hutton had taken Mrs. Merton into the
palm court, and appeared to be talking earn-
estly to her. After all, her aunt was right.
She was dangerous.
Before long, however, Mrs. Merton and
Jack Hutton returned to the ballroom. Jack
made for Dorothy, and proposed that he
should take her into the palm court and
show her the gold fish. Before she knew
where she was, Jack had taken her arm
and led her out.
With faltering voice he told her the old,
old tale, and he added, “If it hadn’t been
for Mrs. Merton, I would never have sum-
moned up the courage to ask you. She said
that you are the sweetest girl she knows,
and that it would be a lucky man who got
you.”
They stayed in the palm court a long
while, talking as if the world existed only
for themselves. When Jack led her back
to the room she walked as if on air.
Next day Dorothy mused on all that had
happened. How wonderful it had been! She
was so happy. There whs, however, one
thing that troubled her and marred her
otherwise complete happiness. But she
could not confide in her aunt or her sisters;
they would only laugh. Happy
Mrs. Merton would understand. She would
talk things over with her.
Mrs. Merton was in, in the maid said, and
would she mind stepping into her bedroom,
where she was just taking it easy and
resting ?
Dorothy talked long of her engagement.
Then, after some hesitation, she mentioned
to Mrs. Merton that she wore false hair
over her ears, and she had always heard
that men detested women assisting nature
in that way. Jack would probably despise
her for it. “But what am I to do?” she
exclaimed with a sigh. “My hair is so thin
and scraggy that it would be impossible to
dress it in the fashion without using some
false hair. If I only had your hair, Mrs.
Merton! How glorious it looks falling
down!”
“My dear, any healthy woman can have
good hair by looking after it.”
“I’m quite sure I would go to any trouble
if I thought I should ever have hair like
yours.”
“But you don’t need to go to a great deal
of trouble. All I do to keep mine luxuriant
and glossy is to shampoo it regularly with
Stallax. Usually, too, at the change of the
seasons I make a simple tonic at home. To
make the tonic I get from the chemist a
package of pure boranium, and mix it witfl
half a pint of bay rum. I rub it well into
the scalp night and morning for a week or
two. You can’t beat boranium for restoring
dull and lifeless hair, and making healthy
hair more beautiful.”
“Will the stallax shampoo and the bora-
nium tonic make my hair thick enough to
do without ear muffs?”
“Certainly, my dear. After using the
stallax shampoo and boranium a few months
your hair will be beautifully thick and
glossy. You won’t need any ear muff's then.”
“Please forgive me, Mrs. Merton, if I ask
what that cream is that you are rubbing into
your face?”
“It’s mercolized wax, but I suppose you
know what wonderful stuff it is.”
“Indeed, I don’t.”
“Then I’d advise you to get a tin at once.
It’s the best possible cream for the com-
plexion, because it imperceptibly removes the
old, worn-out skin, and reveals the baby skin
underneath.”
“But does the young skin last?”
“Yes, if you use the wax regularly. You
know that in time the sun and wind dis-
color the skin, and you need to periodically
remove the discoloration.”
"Oh, it’s after six—I must be going. You
have been very helpful to me, dear Mrs.
Merton. But not a word, please, to un-
people. I can’t thank you enough for help-
ing me out of my dilernma.” — Advt.

Bushwhacker: You go too far. There are
and have been hundreds of thousands of Irishmen
and men of Irish birth in Australia who are not
“hated.” A few Australian politicians and parsons are
or profess to be bitter sectarians ; the vast majority
of Australians don’t know what the beastly thing
is... .O.L.I.: Thanks; we’re afraid we’ll have to
admit that we can’t remember all the jests that
have been printed... .Jack Marlow: Too much like a
telegram—topical verse should flow freely
Swinger: Better consult a vet M.McC.: Try
some off your own bat D.J.MeL.: All rather too
obvious.. . .Lucy K.: Not a bad attempt, yet not well
enough done for a sonnet A. B., Jnr.: Prose
written out to look like verse. ... Namoa: The verse
depends on its song, and it doesn’t sing. The
sketch fails for lack of substance... .L.M.P.: Not
nearly up. ... V.K.T.: They don’t say enough....
Edwin W.: Painful verse in a language unknown
to us G.W.W.: Weak in too many places....
Gum-Burrow: Dreadful A.P.I.: No interest for
us G.L.L.: They don’t stir anything in us....
Sport: Too thin, and would call for much sand-
papering before use Q.P.: Not up Aarvi:
Pleasing enough in its way, but this is a poor
market for that class of goods J.C.M.: Must go
back. . . .E.J.G.: Says .nothing fresh. . . .I.A.F.: Not
well enough done H.A.Y.: Read some of our
stories, then read a telegram, and see the differ-
ence in manner Ripponlea: Oh, well, we suppose
we ought to congratulate you:—-
Quiet and meditating,
I sate on the edge of a Bluff,
And the waters were palpitating
Where the rocks were rough ;
I poised and gazed below me,
To take the awful plunge,
But then my nerves deserteth me
Like water out of a sponge.
' Don C.: Something seems to have turned you
sour. .. .Old Colonist: Too crude....Noo South:
Your jests have the marks of the Flood on them....
W.J.S.: It’s not clear what they were all laughing
about. .. .B.V.E.: Bad verse ; poor idea... .Geigh
T.: You don’t make as much of it as you might....
James: Only a poor pretence of verse.. . .E.R.R.:
Glad to know that your muse will “asend her silver
throne to smote a chaster music from her lyre, repeal-
ing Heaven’s wonders.” You’ve evidently got your
muse well broken to double harness.... Quest: It
hops, but it can’t hop in P.C.E.: Tame little
thing Leonore: Nicely done, but too slight
Will J.: The verse is very bad Hall B.: You
can’t manufacture words at will to supply needed
rhymes. At least you can—and do —but this is an
unprogressive paper where such practices are con-
cerned .... Max W.: There are some suggestive phrases
in the “Beloved” set of verses; the thing is worth
working at. But why do you write modern English
and then throw in “thy” and “doth”? Mombak:

With arm of brawn Mick stepped aside*
And glance of scorn ; And on Pat’s hide
He went for his opponent, Landed one he felt;
Patrick O’Flaherty, Sparring around
Ilis hair all carroty, Opening Pat found,
Under Mick’s guard, And with awful blow
On his nose hard. Mick crumpled up slow
All in a moment. Receiving cine below the belt.
....Ray M.: Haven’t an idea what it’s all about.
. ...J.M.F.: “The Moth” is well enough done, but
that sort of thing has been done so often that it
is as familiar as a poached egg.... Julie B.: The
rain was tapping, falling on the wings ot night,
treading the corridors, creeping like a moonbeam
and awaking echoes like a bell. Evidently very
noisy and oppressively silent; also very wet and
rather on the dry side.... W.E.D.: Doesn’t convince;
and the whole thing is about as pleasant as a dead
plague rat. ... J.E.P.: Don’t care for them....
Majela B.: The yarn leaves our deeps unruffled....
F.W.S.: Trick verse that doesn’t quite get there
Venturino: Not enough marrow in its bones....
Jinhie D.: Indifferently done.... Darrell S.: A lum-
bering ard obvious attempt to make mirth..'..
T.A.C.: It doesn’t make a yam. . . .P.P. (Egypt):
Only matter for a small par. in the shark yarn....
K.T.O.: “Charlie” doesn’t shout for print W.J.T.:
There is no grip in it A.M.M.: It is neither
verse nor prose. . . . A.R.C.: Idea no good and hand-
ling poor.... B.V.E.: That subject, has been done to
death and you don’t contrive to make it attractive.
A.B. (Elsternwick) : Not well written; not
worth writing, anyhow John B.: “Night Dreams”
hasn’t enough beef and Yorkshire pudding in it....
A.H.G.: Matter ridiculous ; verse bad John B.:
The verse is mixed and the signature looks like
the expiring agony of a wasp drowned in ink
The Overlander: Misses Fred A.: “The Passing
Pioneer” has holed out Colin W.: Not the goods
fo. this barrow. .. .T.A.W.: Point wants sharpening.
• * * - Stan F.: Poor stuff. . . .W.J.B.: “Annie” is
not bright enough to be asked in T.C.: A pity
to waste good work on such a worn-out idea....
Steve H.: Call in the vet. to one or two of the
lame verses; and then we shall be glad to see
them again Dar: Some of “Merlane” is verv
fine; some of it tramps heavily.... Norman S.:
Good material turned to poor account. You leave
the reader to do too much guessing. .. .Rhoda R.:
Too small. . . . A.E.K.: That’s a good plot; but you
haven’t done the necessary work on the detail” to
make it convincing.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Kisum : No better... .E.M.E.: Some promise; but
broaden out and draw larger to allow for reduction.
• • ...L.L.: You may understand Fritz’s morals, but
you certainly don’t know his anatomy. .. .WAV'.:
Curiously transparent timber in that fence A.E* :
Neither face is human... .J.R.U.: Drawing not quite
up B.D.B.: If it’s meant for a Chinese calendar
it s excellent; if it’s meant for anything else it’s
awful J.B.: You’ve missed badly with those fore-
shortened legs W.A.C.: Ancient gag... .H.W.T.:

motcir-ataxia is comfortably fixed in the basket....

ably do better next time.” You can’t do worse.

REXONA: the Surfer’s Friend.
To all lovers of outdoor sport a dip in the roaring breakers on a summer’s day is indeed
romance. Next day the sunburnt, blistered hands and scarlet face are painful realities. This distress
can be avoided by the application of soothing, cooling, healing Rexona to the face, hands and arms.
Try the following treatment after your swim, and you will be delighted with the happy result:
First bathe the face, hands and arms in tepid water, making a good lather with Rexona Soap.
Massage with this, then softly dry and apply Rexona gently to the skin. If this is done there
will be no after-effects from exposure to the sun, no regrets after a happy day, for the skin,
soothed by the wonderful influence of Rexona, will quickly regain its normal temperature and
comfortable coolness.
You will find Rexona Skin and Facial Soap ideal as a shampoo for the hair after your dip.
Rexona Soap and Rexona in its dainty pot should stand on the toilet table of all who indulge
in outdoor sports.
Your
beautify
Hair.
Do you know that in less than ten minutes you can double the
beauty of your hair? It becomes light, wavy, fluffy, abundant, and
appears as soft, lustrous and charming as anyone could desire, after a
simple wash with Rexona Soap. A delightful surprise awaits those
whose hair has been neglected, or is scraggy, dry, brittle or thin.
Rexona Soap cleanses the hair of all dust, dirt or excess oil, and in
a few moments you have doubled the beauty of your hair. Rexona
Soap dissolves every particle of Dandruff, cleanses, purifies and invigo-
rates the scalp, for ever stopping itching and falling hair. If you care
to have pretty hair, and lots of it, get a tablet of Rexona Soap to-day.

“Adamascus”: The Queensland Prohibi-
tion League is inviting plans for a hostel in
Brisbane estimated to cost £45,000. The
property has a frontage of 196 ft., and was
given to the League by the Brisbane Total
Abstinence Society. Donations of £15,000 and
£6OOO and two of £5OOO each have already
been offered, so evidently there will be no
shortage of the necessary cash. When com-
pleted the hostel will embody the ideal of the
League—a pub without a bar.

“Dash Dotty” : The recent bad breakdown
of telegraph lines between Melbourne and
Sydney emphasises the folly of running all
the wires along the one route. With the ex-
ception of one line which; is on railway-
poles, all the connecting w T ires are on the
same sticks. It only wants one or two to
fall and a complete dislocation occurs. An
alternative set of lines should be built down
the N.S.W. coast and then via Gippsland to
Melbourne. This would provide a wealth of
spare wire for “patching” purposes, and it
would need an extra-good blow to disconnect
the two capitals.
“Sturt”: Adelaide’s best site, or there-
abouts, the Grenfell-King-William corner,
past which every tram of every route in city
and suburbs passes, is at last to carry a
decent building. The T. and G. Insurance
Co. bought it as long ago as 1912 for
£30,000. They have at last grown tired of
waiting for building costs to come down,
and so are going to show Adelaide how the
thing should be done. The new place will
run from the Register office well round into
King William-street, displacing the present
little old shops, and its 10 storeys above
ground will make it by far the highest build-
ing in the city.
* * * #
“Yarrum” : The discussion had turned on
the structural requirements of hotels. “Bal-
conies is _ all right; make no mistake about
that,” said Torpy. “When Wentagong was
flooded out in 1913 all the women and child-
ren were taken to the churches on the hill,
and us men were quartered in the two pubs.
It rained heavens-hard for 10 days; and for
two of them 20 or more of us was bangin’ by
the skinuvourteetli on the slippery roof. The
other pub, just across the street, had a bal-
cony • and here was us poor cows on the
cold iron, while the other lucky coves were
out on the balcony drinking gin hot and wav-
ing their glasses to us. Cruel, that’s what
it was! A pub without a balcony ortn’t to
get a license.”
* * * *
“T.P.”: It’s a quarter of a century since
I first preached in The Buleetin the desir-
ability of Australians growing their own to-
bacco. In those days we were told we
“lacked the mysterious tobacco-atmosphere
quality of portions of the U.S.” and the
“niggers with innate knowledge who tended
the plants.” Much more recently I predicted
success for the many Upper Murray (Vic.)
men who were taking the business up seri-
ously. This is their first year, and J. Gil-
mour, of the British-Australasian Tobacco
Co., has just finished a business trip to the
new districts. Result: 25 tons at prices up
to 3s. per lb., all flue-cured and all grown by
white labor. Th e expert is satisfied there is
plenty of land suitable for extension. One
man can attend to five or six acres; an
experienced grower can cultivate 10 acres
with additional labor at periods. One farmer
sold four tons. All the growers are increas-
ing their areas.
* * * *
“Mendelian” considers the hog
If Australia is to keep the bailiff out by exporting
primary products, it would be as well that the kind
of pioducts that are wanted and will command the
best price should be exported. Economically the pig
is the real king of beasts, and his products of the
right quality have never gone begging for a market.
" !lat is the riff ll * Quality for export purposes is the
question that presses. Giving evidence before the
Carruthers Committee, C. J. Mcßae, president of
the N.S.W. Primary Producers’ Union, stated: “We
cannot get our bacon on the English market because
the English taste is different from ours. They pre-
fer a heavier bacon. They would sooner take bacon
containing a lot more fat and salt. I went into
these matters with the representatives of English
firms. ’ That our net exports of hams and bacon in
only £257,823 and of lard only
£374,818, or a mere half-million or so all told,
certainly stresses a disagreeable fact. That there is
an almost unlimited market for pig-products in Eng-
land that country’s imports are proof; and with our
frequ'ent gluts of milk and maize and other crops
we ought to be well placed to produce these lines.
Is it beyond Australia’s capacity to breed and cure
and send along the article the market wants and
will pay for?
THE GIVEN SPOT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
All Cow Flat was in carnival —
’Twas “Back to Cow Flat Day”;
From far-off towns came one and all
To make the season gay.
The undertaker brought his hearse —
No Cow Flat man was he,
But there was business to nurse,
And so he joined the spree.
Each banner with its chaste device
For local loyalty pled:
“Buy Locally and Hang the Price,”
A sign of Herman’s said.
Each citizen his own renown
Proclaimed in language terse;
“Be Buried In Your Own Home Town”
Hung gladly from the hearse.
Higgs on his concertina played,
Whilst someone banged a tub ;
These led the marchers as they strayed,
But paused at Dolan’s pub....
The long day passed with shout on shout
And song and merry din,
For as some from the bar came out,
More thirsty souls went in.
The City Press was there, and he,
When evening hours had come,
With phrases writ exultantly
Made all the long wires hum.
“When the procession moved away,’’
He wired (well was he shot),
“It took it over half a day
To pass a given spot.”

“Belyanda”: “Cuzenos” complains (B.
20/9/’23) tliat the name of G. E. Dalrymplo,
the N.Q. explorer, is nowhere commemo-
rated on the map—tliat not even "a pub
or a horserace" is named after him. Quite
true; but there’s a Dalrymplc Shire, one of
the largest in North Queensland. Its head-
quarters are Charters Towers.
The new lectureship in plant pathology at
Adelaide ’Varsity goes to Geoffrey Samuel,
son of J. Iv. Samuel, one of that city's min-
ing and financial men. lie came back last
week from a 10 months' tour, having been
sent to Britain, Holland, France and South
Africa to study diseases of plants before
starting his teaching work.
“T.E.A.” : “.Tacky Boo.” who suggests (B.
27/9/’23) that all half-crowns of George lll.'s
time bear the date on the tail side, is no
authority on numismatics. The half-crown
of George 111., coined in 1816 and subsequent
years, had the date on the “head” side. In this
coinage the arms of Scotland were substi-
tuted for’ the lilies of France, which had
been quartered in the English arms since the
days of Crccy and Poictiers.
Huge railway stores are to be erected by
the Vic. Railway Commissioners at Spots-
wood, a mile from Newport workshops. The
Railway Standing Committee has given its
approval, as it is satisfied from its inspection
of the existing scattered and mostly out-of-
date storehouses that they make handling,
distribution and supervision more costly
than if the big stock were kept at a central
depot. Building and equipment will take
from 18 months to two years.
“Caveman” : Did anyone ever know a Jew
sailor? After several voyages in wind-
jammers and steamers, and some years of
shore work among deep-sea crews, I can’t
recall a single instance. I have come across
a Kaffir, an Eskimo and an Australian black
tramping the decks of sundry craft, but never
a Jew —a Jew, that is, of European stock.
The reason can hardly be a racial aversion to
salt water—Jews will start on any voyage if
there is a prospect of profit at the end of it.
“Herodot”: For sheer hard luck, how’s
this? In the pockets of a man who was
knocked down by a motor in Mel-
bourne and killed were three sweep
tickets, two for Tatt.’s and one for the
Golden Casket. The drawings took place
the day after the ticket-holder died in hos-
pital, and prizes were won by all three —
several hundred pounds. To cap it all, the
wage-earner to whom Fate was so spiteful
had been investing in Tatt.’s for years with-
out ever drawing a bean.
“A. Bone”: During the prohibition cam-
paign in Queensland, a large poster appeared
in a prominent street of Rockhampton, ex-
horting the people to
Vote
2
3
X.
Next morning it read: —
Vote
2 pints of beer
3 times a day
Xcept Sunday.
“Yarrum”: Travelling through the Mudgee
(N.S.W.) district, a couple of us stopped
at the only pub for breakfast. There were
five boiled eggs on the table ; and we finished
them. At the door the landlady demanded
Is. 6d. from me and Is. 9d. from the cobber.
He asked why the charge was not the same,
and was told : "You het three heggs—’Tilda
was keepin’ an heye on yeh through the
hauger-hole.” I have been scared of auger-
holes ever since.
“Randolph Rentless” : No ; generosity does
not pay. There is a “two-up joint” in Surry
Hills (Sydney) which celebrated its tenth
anniversary the other night, and till then
had a record unsmirched by raids. The boss,
a man who runs his motor-car and owns
horses, opened liis heart for the occasion,
and got a supply of liquor on the premises
for the entertainment of old customers and
friends. The beef talked; and a hastily orga-
nised police raid was the next item on the 1 ’
programme.
The big and the little of it. When a Vic.
Treasury officer smashed a finger while shut-
ting a safe, surgical aid was summoned and
£1 11s. Od. paid. This trifling item is set
down in a separate line in the unforeseen and
accidental expenditure list presented to Par-
liament, and only the same space is given to
the items: “Entertaining visitors and others
in Melbourne, £ll.BB 11s. 9d.” ; “entertaining
visitors and others in London, £l3l 10s. 7d.”
Dissected, the last two items would have pro-
vided something much more interesting than
a jambed finger.
“Lexite": A queer story of “the luck of
thirteen” comes to me from Condobolin
(N.S.W.). A lady of that far-back town
presented Australia with her 13th contribu-
tion to the population on Sept. 13, the baby
being a healthy youngster who scaled 131 b.
It was christened when 13 days old; and
its grandfather, taking the sequence as a
tip, backed number 13 in the Epsom and Met-
ropolitan acceptances. It was the right “oil,”
for he scored wins on Claro and Sir Andrew.
Now the family is pursuing its luck in Tatt.’s
as the “Thirteens Syndicate.”
“ Jarrah” : In blissful disregard of the regu-
lations, a skirted passenger one day recently
tried to smuggle her dog aboard a Kalgoorlie
tram. The lynx-eyed conductor intercepted
the intruder with his foot, and as he rang
the car away swept it gently but firmly off
the platform on to the road. The enraged
female turned on him and demanded angrily,
“Are not dogs allowed to ride on these cars?”
“No,” abruptly answered the ticket-clipper.
“Then stop the car and let me off,” she re-
plied with an assumption of outraged dig-
nity that was only partly responsible for the
smile that flickered along the line of strap-
hangers.
“Mendelian”: Under its Child Welfare
Bill the Fuller Ministry proposes to grant
(Part 8, Section 48) “a written license
authorising a male child of or over the age
of 12 years to engage in street-trading.”
The bill is also concerned in trying
to cope with mental deficiency. A great
fuss is being made about “dead-end”
jobs and the difficulty in dealing with the
product thereof. Has the Government asked
the special police their opinion of what
street-trading is apt to lead male infants to?
Employers complain of the difficulty of get-
ting apprentices to train. Is a boy that
started street-trading at 12 likely to make a
good apprentice?

The Laughing Windows.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OVER the drab roofs dancing,
Theddarn,w r n, with rosy feet,
Comes merrily advancing
To smile upon the street.
Its rays of sunlight lightly
Amongst the shadows run,
And dingy windows brightly
Are laughing at the sun.
Last night, like tears drip-dripping,
I listened to the rain,
And somewhere, my heart gripping,
A child’s weak cries of pain.
The winds, each leakage raking,
Passed with a moaning breath ;
A sick man’s cough out-breaking
Contained a note of death !
And when the storm its scuffle
Ceased in the dreary street,
I heard the hopeless shuffle
Of some poor vagrant’s feet.
Thus, whilst I lay, to shiver
With thoughts of slumber slain,
Life seemed to me a-quiver
With misery and pain.
Miles upon miles of pain-ways
Outspread like fearful wens,
I saw decaying laneways
Where mankind made its dens.
Dull streets in dull streets ended—
They stretched out mile on mile....
But now the day is splendid,
And dingy windows smile.
The breeze is soft and fragrant;
The children’s voices rise;
Even the passing vagrant
Has courage in his eyes.
The. laughing windows sadness
Have banished. Smiles each pane,
As man’s soul takes its gladness
And gives it back again!

HAMER.
The Jackass.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MORE than once during the morning
old Scotty, as the children called
him, had decided to give up teach-
ing and try some other game. And not the
first time. But what else could he do? No-
thing! Nothing at all! Thirty years of
struggling with refractory children had lelt
him helpless, and his bad leg, packed with
varicose veins, was a continual reminder that
he had better stick to the paths he knew.
He sat in his chair, surreptitiously watch-
ing the clock, and listening to a thin girl
droning out the rivers of China. Twenty
minutes more! Three weeks on h riday till
the Christmas holidays! That was the way
his mind ran. Aloud lie said with an all-
ot asking something he really wanted to
know: ~
“Now, tell me the largest town on the
Hoang-Ho, Jessie.”
The boys in the back seat were scuffling
over a bronze-winged beetle that had c pme
whirring into the room from the hot paddock
outside, but he pretended not to know. That
was the safest way. An hour before, irri-
tated beyond endurance by the way little
pellets of paper were whizzing across the
room, he had said :
“Now, then, you boys! If there s any
more disorder in that back seat I’ll cane the
whole lot of you.”
That had quietened them for a time, but
shortly afterwards, when he turned to the
blackboard, there had been a twang of elas-
tic, and he had felt a hornet-sting on the
back of the neck. The test had come. In-
stead of meeting it, he had gone on writing,
a flush of humiliation creeping up to the
bald dome of his forehead.
Many incidents of this kind had sapped
Ms confidence, and increased theirs.
They had mastered him and he knew it,
but he ploddc-d along shiftlessly, with his
eye on the clock and the calendar. He hau
always a hope that after the holidays things
might be different. The rowdier boys would
probably not come back, and he would assert
his authoritv over the rest with more vigor.
Anything to" get through those hot, summer
days, when the sun crackled on the tin roof
and the air inside was so stifling that it made
the brain drowsy and incapable of effort!
“We’ll go out five minutes early to-day,
he announced. “Now, you little girls, eat
your lunches in the shade and keep) cool.
And you, Jim Tracy! Don’t let me catch
you outside the paddock or it’ll mean an
extra half-hour after school.”
A wild yell, and they scattered over the
hot paddock like a mob of cattle. The
teacher returned to eat his lunch, though
the meat sandwiches Mrs. Goyt had cut did
not tempt him. He felt exhausted, and
wanted nothing better than to lie down in
some cool spot by the creek and watch the
kingfishers skimming along the water. That
was how he spent his Saturdays and Sun-
days, with sometimes an excursion to the
township to get a couple of books from the
School of Arts.
Yells came from the playground, a clatter
of feet from the verandah, and he had a
sense that curious eyes were peering in at
him through the windows. Impudent young
monkeys! He was ashamed that he could
be so cowed by a handful of children: yet
how formidable they were in the mass, and
how tireless in devising ways to torment
him! Tlsev knew all his weaknesses—his
love of birds, his fear of the inspector, his
dislike of scratchy pencils—and they worked
on them with subtlety and persistence.
Hfirdly a week passed but one of them
brought news that the inspector was in the
township, and they nudged one another and
giggled when lie watched the windows for the
first sight of a hiiggv coming down the road.
Absent-mindedly he unrolled a crumpled
piece «f paper that had fallen near his desk,
and there saw- his image as it appeared to
their eyes. There was th e little wart-like
nose, the bald head and the prominent eyes
standing out on stalks like a prawn’s. From
beneath the grey, drooping moustache issued
a balloon that enclosed the scribbled words :
“Now. then, you boys in the back seat!”
Jim Tracy’s writing, without a doubt!
Scotty had seen that caricature before, done
by other hands, on slates and exercise-covers,
even cut into the bark of the white-guratrees
by the creek. Only deep hostility, he felt,
could lend such cunning to the impish fingers.
Probably some young rogue, smarting from
the cane, had given shape to the image first,
and much practice had reduced the lines to
a convention, so that they could all draw it.
He crumpled the paper between his- fingers
as a little girl appeared at the door.
“Well, Jessie, what is it now?”
“Please, sir, Jim Tracy’s caught a jackass.”
“What?”
“Jim Tracy’s hooked a jackass with a bent
pin and a lump of bread.”
A warm flush spread over Scotty’s face as
he jumped up and went to the door. Any
hint of cruelty to birds roused a passion in
him that he could not control, making his
very knees tremble. In the corner of the
paddock he saw a group of boys standing
under a tree, holding a jackass at the end
of a long string. There was a din of voices,
and the bird, every feather in its body ruffled,
was making futile efforts to disgorge the bait
and get away.
Scotty appeared among the crowd of grin-
ning boys with the swiftness of some heavy
stone set rolling down a hill. He caught the
jackass and set it free; then stood up and
glared around him. The flush had left his
face, and it was white as chalk.
“Jim Tracy,” li e said thickly, “come inside
with me !”
A silence spread over the whole playground.
For the moment passion, real passion, had
made Scotty supreme. The boy, a big, over-
grown fellow with black eyes and a mop of
tangled hair, looked round at his mates as if
for support; but seeing them withdraw from
him he slouched inside. There was a look
of sulky rebellion on his face.
“What’s this for?” he demanded. “Every-
one picks on me.”
Scotty could hardly trust himself to speak
as he took the cane from the drawer.
“Hold out your hand.”
Twice the outstretched hand flinched away
from the pane as it came swishing down. In
exasperation Scotty cut sharply at the boy’s
legs. Then lie felt the cane jerked out of his
fingers, and heard it snap as the boy broke it
before his eyes and rushed out of the door.
In all his career nothing quite like this
had happened. The afternoon session was one
long nightmare. There was no open mutiny,
but feet scraped along the floor, forms were
knocked over, and slates fell with a clatter.
On all sides he felt himself surrounded by
hot; rebellious eyes. Jim Tracy was the
hero of the school, and though none knew 7
exactly what had occurred, they had all seen
him running down the paddock and home
across the creek. In the corner, too, the
broken cane still lay!
That night, sitting on his lonely verandah,
.Scotty felt that things had reached a climax.
He could not go on any longer. For thirty
years he had been teaching, and for nearly
twenty he had been going downhill, till he
had reached this isolated spot, with a hand-
ful of children he could not control. The
image of those fiendish young figures dancing
round the hooked jackass was before his
eyes, and he felt that he himself was the
tormented bird. Their mocking laughter was
in his ears as he choked and spluttered.
“That’s it,” he thought. “A tormented old
jackass! All youngsters are cruel, and they
hate birds.”
He had once had hopes of Jim Tracy.
There was something human and likeable
about the boy when school was out, and he
was away from the rest. Sometimes he
stayed behind to borrow a book from the
library, and once they had gone fishing to-
gether up the creek. But there w r as a per-
versity in the boy’s nature that made him the
worst of the lot v'hen he was rubbed the
wrong way. And now he had lost his hold
on the only mind he could make any appeal
to !
“I’m a sick man,” he told himself, shuf-
fling to the cupboard where he kept his
whisky. “I need something to put me right
—inspector or no inspector.”
He knew 7 that if he started drinking now
there_ would be no pulling up while a drop
remained. Generally when the temptation
was insistent he left the key in charge of
Mrs. Goyt. This time, though, he had kept
it in his waistcoat pocket. He was opening
the cupboard when a faint knock sounded.
He closed the door with a snap. “Come in!”
he said gruffly.
There was a shuffling of boots on the ver-
andah and a face appeared at the door, blink-
ing at the light. The boy’s hat was pulled
down low 7 over his eyes, but it could not
conceal the half-furtive, half-adventurous
look that lurked in them.
“Mother sent you over a bit of mutton,”
he said awkwardly. “A forequarter and a
few chops. We killed to-night.”
He w 7 as embarrassed and ill at ease, but
not more so than the teacher.
“Thanks, Jim,” said Scotty, his back still
turned. “That’ll be a surprise for Mrs.
Goyt in the morning, eh? Come inside a
moment.”
He put the mutton on the cupboard, and
then cast _ his eyes vaguely round the room,
ns if looking for some means of communica-
tion. Finally he took up the packet of
apples Goyt had brought from the township.
“Have some fruit,” he said, holding it out.
“Not much about till the peaches come in.
I’m sorry for wdiat happened this morning,
Jim.”
The boy took an apple, and then looked
up with a shame-faced expression.
“I didn’t hook that jackass, Mr. Byett.”
he blurted out. “It was some of them little
blokes. I’d only just come up.”
“You had!” Scotty gasped in astonish-
ment. “Then I made a mistake.”
The boy looked confused.
“I suppose I could have stopped them,” he
admitted. “I’ve given some of them a belt-
ing for trying it on before.”
There was genuine regret in his voice, but
no sense of abasement. He seemed to feel
that the affair was an unfortunate one, from
which none of them had emerged with much
credit. Scotty filled his pipe with clumsy
fingers, and ransacked the empty spaces of
his mind for words.
“You’ve got a lot of influence with them,
.Tim,” he began. “I wish you’d use it more.
There’s better sport than baiting helpless,
dumb things. It isn’t easy for me to show
them that, though.”
Not a word about the incident with the
cane ! There did not seem to be any words

Don t let that dull, constant backache discourage you.
Worry will only make it worse. The sensible plan is to
find the cause and correct it. That nagging backache
may be Nature s way of warning you that all is not right
with your kidneys.
When the kidneys fall behind, the blood becomes over-
loaded with uric acid and other poisons. You suffer
daily backache, and a tired, weak, all-worn-out feeling.
You feel nervous and depressed; your head aches; you are
dizzy and annoyed by bladder irregularities.
You want to be well, and the best way to get well is to
give the weakened kidneys the help they need. Just take
things easier for awhile, and help the weakened kidneys
with Doan s Backache Kidney Pills. Doan’s have helped
thousands and should help you. Ask your neighbor!
TESTIMONY FROM SYDNEY PEOPLE.
TWO PERMANENT CURES.
Mrs. S. Drew, 30 Briggs Street, Camperdown, Sydney, says“ Some
time ago my kidneys were in a seriously disordered state, and in consequence
I suffered terribly. My back never stopped aching, and I often used to feel
I could hardly bear it any longer. The pain took all the life and energy
out of me, and I was almost crippled with the ailment. Dropsical swellings
showed on my legs and ankles, and there was puffiiness under my eyes. The
state of my health worried me terribly, and as I had taken all sorts of
remedies without deriving any benefit I was beginning to think I would
never be well again. However, to make a long story short, at last I got
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and they proved a godsend. The first couple
of bottles eased my suffering a little, and seven bottles of the pills cured me
completely. The backache has gone, the dropsical swellings have disappeared,
and I feel splendid. I have pleasure in recommending Doan’s Pills to all
kidney sufferers.”
Mr. John Simmons, Dutton Road, Eankstown, says:—“For some years
1 suffered dreadfully from backache and kidney trouble. I was under a
doctor tor a good while, but his treatment did not benefit me very much.
A mend of mine heard of a wonderful cure by Doan’s Backache Kidney
t ills, so he urged me to try these pills, and I decided to do so. After taking
one bottle I felt very much better, and as I kept on with them the improve-
ment was maintained until finally I was completely cured, and I have not
r> £ -n a , Slgn backache and kidney trouble since. Doan’s Backache Kidney
t ills have my hearty recommendation, and I hope many will benefit by my
experience and give them a trial.”
Five years later Mrs. Simmons says:—“My husband has had no return
ot ins old complaint since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured him some
years ago. We always keep this medicine in the house and find it a most
beneficial tonic for the kidneys.”

VANCE PALMER.
Cats.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MY friend the Professor is a fussy
little person with ideas -on Evolu-
tion, who whiles away my franti-
cally busy office hours with long' discussions
upon his theories. He, I might add. does all
the discussing : I am merely a departmental
head with ideas only on Circumlocution.
When, therefore, he pranced excitedly into
my office this evening with a light in his
short-sighted eyes which I have learned to
know, and making queer little bubbly gurgles
in his throat like a neglected coffee-pot, I
put away from me all the impedimenta of
a busy Government official and prepared for
a long session.
In the Professor’s hand was a cutting
from the evening paper. Putting it carefully
down on the table before me, he stood by
while I read it, crowing triumphantly the
while. It was headed in bold type :
MYSTERIOUS CASE.
Well-known Society Youth Runs Amok.
And it read :
Before Mr. Bumblewig, P.M., at the City Police
Court to-day, William Tenterfield Rushton, a young
man, well known in society circles, was charged at
the instance of the S.P.C.A. with malicious cruelty,
causing the death of seven cats. Evidence for the
prosecution stated that last night, about 11 o’clock,
Mr. Neaton, one of the Society’s representatives,
was aroused at his home at 43 Sm'all-street by-
defendant knocking at the door.
On Mr. Neaton opening- it, defendant, who seemed
to be in a state of great excitement, demanded to
know if lie (Mr. Neaton) possessed any eats. Mr.
Neaton admitted to two.
“Yellow and white ones?” queried defendant
eagerly.
One, Mr. Neaton told him, was of that color.
At this defendant became still more excited, and
demanded the production of the cat. On Mr. Nea-
ton’s refusal, defendant wanted to buy it, offering
prices which Mr. Neaton could only' describe as
extraordinary. On being questioned as to the pur-
pose for which he required it, defendant became
exceedingly violent in manner, and shouted “Kill
’em! Kill ’em all!”
He thereupon showed Mr. Neaton seven dead cats,
all yellow and white, which he had left at the
gate. Mr. Neaton remonstrated with him, where-
upon defendant struck him violently upon the nose.
Mr. Neaton then called Constable Toslo and gave
defendant in charge.
In reply to Mr. Bum hie wig: “Defendant seemed
perfectly sober, but was evidently laboring under
intense excitement.”
Constable Toslo gave evidence of arrest.
Defendant was remanded, bail being allowed.
I laid the paper down and looked at the
Professor.
"Well?” I asked.
“Well!” he echoed eagerly. “Isn’t it all
there? Doesn’t it prove my theory up to
the hilt? Here we have an undeniable in-
stance of the sudden intervention iof an anti-
pathy dating from an earlier evolutionary
period ; a retrocession to a former existence.
It is perfectly evident to me that this un-
fortunate young man, in one of his transi-
tions in the carnivorous order, yvas a dog, and
that the antipathetic influence in his exist-
ence at that remote period was a white and
yellow cat. Some great shock has now set
in motion an extra-mundane psychological
current carrying him hack to this inherent
and ineradicable characteristic of that evolu-
tionary phase, and, for the time being, ion
that particular point, the poor young fellow
is a dog. Isn’t it plain to you?”
“It’s rot to me,” I replied shortly, “see-
ing that I know the whole story.”
"The whole story? Ah, come, my friend,
this is interesting. You shall tell it to me,
and I shall be able to carry my theory to
the utmost limit of proof.”
“Well,” I said, “to begin with, you must
know something of the character of my friend
Bill. He is quite an ordinary sort of per-
son, with the usual accumulated likes and
dislikes—with one exception. His hatred
of cats has existed from his earliest infancy,
and is the strongest feeling in his whole
make-up.”
“Ah!” broke in the Professor eagerly.
“That just proves”
“It originated,” I continued loudly and
firmly, “with the home-cat breaking the por-
celain vase in the drawing-room and Bill
getting the blame and the subsequent smack-
ing. As he grew up, various things occurred
to strengthen his antipathy, until it reached
such a point of intensity that he recently
left home and moved into nooms of his own
because the new next-door neighbors harbored
a cat!
“About three months ago he fell in love
with a lady—whose name is immaterial. The
match was ideal in every way, as each had a
plentiful supply of what the other lacked.
She had money, beauty, no position and very
little brains. Bill was without means, ugly,
socially well-placed and brainy.
“Everything went well, and it was arranged
that Bill should visit her home last night
to see her people. It was his first visit, as
the two had met before only in town, and
he took me with him. I have a car—Bill
hasn’t—and there was an elder sister, I be-
lieve, to be kept away. I’m that sort iof
middle-aged bachelor.
“On the way I all but ran over a yellow
and white cat. Bill wanted me to stop the
car while he killed it, and railed at me for
missing it.
“ ‘Something,’ he said, ‘tells me that if that
cat isn’t killed to-night it will be no good
to me. Do go back and have another shot.’
“I laughed at his nonsense, and went on.
But he was right.
“ ‘Seeing the family’ was the usual kind
of ordeal, in which you all sit round and
mouth unintelligible insincerities for inter-
minable hours. Everyone knew why Bill
had come, and everyone knew what was going
bo happen—or they all thought they did, but,
of course, had to pretend they didn’t. How-
ever, Bill was progressing favorably, and I
had nothing else to do, so I didn’t mind.
“It was at this juncture, when everything
was going well and nobody was looking half
so bored as he really felt, that a large white
and yellow cat stalked majestically into the
room, with such an air of glad-to-be-at-home-
ness that it was obviously one of the house-
hold ornaments. If it wasn’t our previous
acquaintance of the road, then Nature must
have invested in a duplicator.
“Stretching itself with thorough enjoyment
that cat made straight for Bill. Cats, I might
remark, were as irresistibly and unerringly
attracted by his personality as they were
subsequently deflected by his boot.
"There was a heavy, sickening pause. Tra-
gedy was in the air. The members of the
family glanced nervously at one another, and
at Bill. His fiancee was leaning forward,
her lips parted as though to speak, a look in
her eyes which I could not fathom. For a
perceptible moment the world seemed to stand
still. Nobody breathed, the only sound the
low purring of the cat as it rubbed against
Bill’s leg. Bill’s face was a picture. He
gazed down at that cat with hornor. His
right foot writhed beneath his chair, his toes
working up and down. I knew that he was
consumed with a desperate longing to kick
that cat into the next suburb ; so 'I glanced
appealingly at him. Surely he could see that
he was on his trial!
"Suddenly he looked -up and saw his sweet-
heart’s face. In a second his mind was
made up. A shudder ran through his
frame; then he deliberately bent down
and picked up that cat and nursed
it! A sort of long-drawn sigh went
round the room. Conversation was hastily
resumed, and Bill, a picture of disgust and
misery, strove hard to interest himself and to
be affable, while still spasmodically stroking
and fondling the cat. I flashed him a look
of congratulation.
"After about an aeon, it seemed, we
rose to go. Bill shuddered himself free of
his burden and drew his fiancee aside for his
own private good-byes. The cat thereupon
made straight for me. Not deeming it
necessary to go to such lengths as Bill, 1
contented myself with rubbing its back with
my foot.
" ‘Fine cat you’ve got here,’ I remarked to
my host.
“‘Cat!’ he exploded. ‘Fine catV He aimed
a lavish but futile kick in the direction of
the fleeing animal. ‘Cats!’ he exclaimed
again. ‘I hate them, loathe them. We
haven’t a cat in the place. I thought it
belonged to you and came in your car. And
I tell you, sir, when I saw your friend nurs-
ing the confounded thing to-night I—l could
have kicked him ! I bet there isn’t another
family in Australia hates cats as much as this
one does.’
“I had my own ideas on this point, but
kept them to myself and took a speedy de-
parture, feeling infinitesimal.
“Why the lovers chose the figtree near the
gate for what they had to say is beyond my
comprehension, but the fact remains that, sit-
ting in the car, I could not help overhearing
their last remarks. I shall tell you only that
part which concerns this story. ‘l’m terribly
sorry, Bill,’ I heard her say, ‘but it’s no use.
I hate them, and I don’t think I could ever
trust a man that liked them. No. I’m sure
I could never marry a man who was fond
of cats !’
"I didn’t speak to Bill on the way home.
I know Bill. In any case, we didn’t go far.
As I slowed down coming to the punt Bill
opened the door without a word, and vanished
into the night. I didn’t try to stop him.
As I said before, I know Bill.”
T picked up the cutting again.
“And this,” I said, “is apparently the
sequel.”
The Professor leapt excitedly to his feet.
The light had returned to his eye, the bubbly
gufgle to his voice.
“But all that,” he cried, “merely proves
my theory. You see”

Content.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now that my life’s so spent
That only peace remains
I sorrow not for bygone joys,
And fears and hopes and pains.
For what I’ve been I am,
And what I’ve had is me.
And what I shall be —ah. the thrill
Of that dear mystery!
I’m free as sunny air
That toys with daisy-chains,
Now that my life’s so spent
That only peace remains.
