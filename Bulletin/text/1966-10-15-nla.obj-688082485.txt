COONAWARRA ESTATE
Coonawarra Estate is the original “Coonawarra”. This famous vineyard
was founded in 1890 (an illustration of the original cellars appears on
every label of genuine Coonawarra Estate wine). Years of careful culti-
vation have consistently produced vintage wines of exceptional quality.

Mihailov’s Speech
Sir,
In my capacity as President of the
International Commission of Jurists
I have just received the text of a
speech hitherto unpublished, in-
tended to be made last month by the
young Yugoslav University Professor
Mihail Mihailov in the city of Zadar
on the Adriatic Coast.
Mihailov was arrested in Zadar on
the Bth August, 1966, just before he
was due to make the speech. He was
sentenced to one year’s imprisonment
for having spread false information and
having disseminated banned printed
material, and other violations of the
Press law and the criminal code, to
all of which he pleaded not guilty.
The State Prosecutor also accused
Mihailov of having aimed at provoking
dissatisfaction among the population and
diminishing the confidence of citizens
in State authorities. The speech which
has reached my hands will deserve to
take its place in Yugoslav history, and
indeed in the history of man’s fight
for freedom everywhere.
It was to have been delivered at the
opening of a Zadar conference to
launch a new magazine. Mihailov leads
off with a quotation from what George
Orwell had written in 1945: “Fifteen
years ago in order to defend freedom,
we had to fight the Conservatives, the
Clericalists, the Fascists. Today, free-
dom has to be defended against Com-
munism and their fellow-travellers.”
The following extracts will show
what an epoch-making document it is,
coming as it does from one who had
declared himself a Socialist, opposed to
a Capitalist society:—
“The most awful thing in a totali-
tarian regime is not so much the exter-
nal physical terror as the collectivisation
of soul which leads to the extinction of
the very instinct of freedom in the
individual.”
“No healthy society can survive with-
out political democracy which is the
condition for economic and cultural
progress.”
“The aim of the proposed new maga-
zine is to create the spiritual and ideo-
logical conditions for the development of
political democracy in our country
“It is important not only to criticise

the existing order but also to build up
and propagate another idea”
“]Ve must have a clear stand in
matters of religion. A society cannot be
f ree as long as people are not entirely
f ree to make their own religious choice,
either for some organised form of
religion or for atheism.”
“To separate the spiritual life of man
f ro m his outside civic duties means to
free him and establish the basis for a
further liberation of the individual, for
spiritual freedom is the basis of all free-
doms. Western liberalism would never
fttve been without the preceding cen-
turies of Christianity. Democracy is
the projection into the social sphere of
authentic Christianity.”
“In spite of all its deficiencies, the
worst multi-party system is better than
the best one-party system.”
“Because the basis of our enterprise
is the Yugoslav Constitution and laws,
the magazine must endeavor to
strengthen the independence of the
judiciary from any form of Party
pressure.”
“Democracy is possible only within
the strict rule of law in a society where
no single individual or group can stand
above the law. The freedom of the■
individual and the rule of law are the
bases of democracy, and every regime
which does not respect these principles
is anti-democratic.”
What touches me personally is that
so much of it, and particularly the last
few quotes, sounds exactly like the
ideals proclaimed by the International
Commission of Jurists, with which I
have been closely associated for so long.
In a final flourish Mihailov again
quotes the pretentious words of the
Yugoslav Criminal Code, the Law on
the Press and Other Media, and the
Constitution itself, all purporting to
confirm the freedom of the Press, and
other fundamental freedoms of
democratic society.
But to no avail. Mihailov was found
guilty for the initiatives he had thus
taken.
Whilst I personally think that
Mihailov and people who think like
him are mistaken in their belief that
true democracy can be achieved in a
completely socialised economy, his
speech is of the greatest significance as
part of an attempt to break free from
Communist tyranny and shows, as I
have said, the seeds of doubt in his
own mind on that very point.

To the Mitcham P.O.
Sir,
In his article “To the Mitcham
P. 0.” (8., Sept. 24), Brian Buckley
refers to the publication “Progressive
Teacher.” The Council of the Vic-
torian Teachers’ Union at its recent
Meeting carried the following resolu-
tion concerning that publication:
“That the VTU express its condem-
nation of the anonymous attacks made
on present and past councillors,
branches, branch executives, and other
members of the VTU made in a publi-
cation, ‘Progressive Teacher,’ Vol. 1,
No. 1. That the VTU condemns the
undeclared members of the Progressive
Teachers’ Association for their inter-
ference in the internal affairs of the
VTU and resents their attempt to dis-
rupt Union affairs by the introduction
of party politics. Further that the
VTU affirms that it is the fundamental
right of individual members of the
Union to hold whatever private views
they wish to hold, and that Council is
confident that its decisions are made
independently of any such views.”

C.S.I.R.O. and its Budget
Sir,
The Agrisearch article “C.5.1.R.0.
and its Budget” (8., Sept. 24) was writ-
ten by someone who appears not only
to be totally ignorant of C.5.1.R.0. but
also to have set out to write an un-
favorable report. The article states that
the only work C.5.1.R.0. has done for
“the man on the land”, as mentioned
in the Annual Report 1965-66, is some
work on bovine vibriosis, early weaning
of lambs, sheep selection, pruning and
watering of sultanas and on some new
pasture species.
The C.5.1.R.0. Annual Report gives
short statements on approximately 100
topics, of which approximately 50 are
of direct importance to practical agri-
culture. Moreover, this annual report is
only an abstract of C.5.1.R.0.’s work
prepared for presentation to Parlia-
ment. Detailed accounts of research in
the field of primary industries are given
in the reports of the biological Divi-
sions.
Your reporter does not seem to
understand the reference in the
C.5.1.R.0. Annual Report to State De-
partments of Agriculture with regard
to regional research and extension. In-
formed people would know that the
C.5.1.R.0. research is done on a
national, principle-seeking basis. Where
its findings have to be applied in specif-
ic regions the State Departments have
the structure and the facilities to carry
out this much-needed “ad hoc” re-
search, as well as extension work to
disseminate their own, Universities’ and
C.5.1.R.0.’s findings.
The most infuriating part of this
article is that dealing with the high
proportion of overseas scientists in
C.5.1.R.0., particularly since I am one
of them. If it were true that a “long
and close association with a region’s
agriculture is . . . essential for a
scientist if he is to make useful sug-
gestions or applicable findings” most
Australian agricultural scientists would
be as badly qualified as one from over-
seas, as it is clear to anyone who knows
anything about the Australian environ-
ment that conditions in different States
and even in different regions within
States are as different from each other
as conditions in Australia are different
from those in Europe, the U.K., or the
U.S.A. However, your reporter did not
appear to be aware of the requirements
of a scientist, which are, among others,
an inquisitive mind, intellect, a good
training in scientific methods, persever-
ance, and an appreciation of problems.
The obvious reasons for the high pro-
portion of foreign scientists in
C.5.1.R.0. (and, by the way, also in
the State Departments and the Uni-
versities) is that Australia is a fast

growing country, which cannot supply
jhe number of scientists needed for its
rate of development. Furthermore, the
record of foreign research scientists in
C.5.1.R.0. shows that most of them
stay for indefinite, long-term periods,
greatly exceeding the period of first
appointment. Finally, he infers, that
C.5.1.R.0. scientists are grossly over-
paid by stating that their salaries “range
substantially higher than those of Uni-
versity-trained C.5.1.R.0. professors.”
The fact is that the salary of
University-trained C.5.1.R.0. personnel
ranges from $3065 to $9931. The only
C.5.1.R.0. scientists who have salaries
comparable to or higher than Uni-
versity professors are Assistant Chiefs,
Chiefs and Members of the Executive.
The generally accepted career range of
C.5.1.R.0. scientists extends to $9209
(which is well below that of a Uni-
versity professor) for a productive
scientist (promotion in C.5.1.R.0. is
by merit).

Death of a University
Sir,
Mr. Arnold Beichman’s discussion of
Professor Lewis Feuer’s extraordinary
piece on Berkeley (8., Sept. 24) has
just been called to my attention. I dare
say that none of us who have been at
Berkeley during the past two years
would describe the experience as easy,
and it is doubtless true that our difficul-
ties are not altogether over. But as a
description of the realities in Berkeley,
Professor Feuer’s article is not simply
misleading; it is almost totally unrecog-
nisable to most of us on the scene. Its
distortions and careful omissions, as
well as its point of view, would require
a far more elaborate analysis than can
be managed in a letter of this kind;
Professor Feuer is a man of consider-
able polemical skill, whatever his
motives. The best reply, for anyone
who might be impressed by his antici-
pation of Berkeley’s imminent demise,
could perhaps only be supplied by a
trip to our campus and conversation
with as many students and faculty as
possible.
I understand that a number of soon-
to-be-published comments from repre-
sentatives of the New Left are almost
as bitter in their treatment of Uni-
versity policy as they are toward
Professor Feuer, a somewhat ironical
circumstance in the light of Feuer’s
charge that we have somehow been
taken over by what he regards as
authoritarian radicals. The fact is that
Berkeley has been under attack from
extremists on both sides. This has been
uncomfortable, but it should also be,
ln a sense, reassuring.
I should like to comment specifically
?? just one of Professor Feuer’s claims,
be seems eager to give the impression
that many members of the Berkeley
acuity are resigning .from the Uni-
versity because of our recent troubles.
his is simply untrue. Our tenure
acuity numbers about a thousand; last

country whose imports exceed $2,177 million
each year. Prosperous, fast-growing South Africa
is a nation with high living standards, people who
buy the same high-quality goods we make here in
Australia. Little wonder an evergrowing brigade
of Australian business men are exploring South
Africa for new business opportunities.
Whilst they’re about it, they’re also exploring

N.B. Taking in South Africa as part of a world trip costs very little in

Liberals and the Bank
Sir,
Your correspondent Don Oxley in his
item “The Bank and the Liberals”
(8., Oct. 1) appears to have given the
impression that the choice for the
Queensland Treasurer, Mr. Chalk, was
between Party policy and State interest
and that State interest won the day
against the wishes of the Party. The
majority of Liberals feel that such was
not the case that, in fact, the two
choices offered were both compatible
with Liberal philosophy therefore the
decision had to be made only on the
basis of what was best for the State.
The actual choice was between the
Commonwealth Bank, who offered the
State certain financial benefits, and the
commercial (private) banks, who
offered nothing on the grounds that
“principle” was involved. In normal
business dealings the choice between
any two offers is always that which
offers the better value, and in this case
it’s not difficult to see which banking
organisation offered the “best deal.”
Thus, it’s the view of many Liberals
in Qld. that the decision in favor of
the Commonwealth Bank was con-
sistent with the best traditions of private
enterprise and, being in the best inter-
ests of the State, the decision was
doubly acceptable.
The reason that the Commonwealth
Bank asked for exclusive rights to the
schools is not hard to see when the
agreement was first signed many years
ago, there were no private savings banks
in Qld., now there are at least four
in the field. Under these circumstances
the majority of Liberals sees nothing
wrong in an exclusive contract which,
again, is a normal business arrange-
ment, which is how most Liberals sum
up the whole affair—a good business-
like arrangement.
NOEL DAVIES

A Priest’s Complaint
Sir,
“Cleric” complains that the Roman
Catholic Church ‘ ‘is somewhat obsessed
with the quantitative approach to re-
ligion” (8., Sept. 24). Apparently it is
now wrong to regard as practising
Catholics those who obey the Church
in hearing Mass on Sundays and going
to the Sacraments; nowadays only
those who “are spreading love and
truth” and are “deeply concerned with
the problems of humanity” are to be
counted as Catholics.
A person who attends Mass and the
Sacraments is most certainly a prac-
tising Catholic. But, like all the rest
°f us, he is a sinner; like all other
Catholics he is one of the good and bad
fish in the net. In Newman’s glowing
words, he is one of “the vast assem-
blage of human beings with wilful pas-
sions and wild intellects brought to-
gether into one by the beauty and
majesty of a Superhuman Power.”
This Power is the Catholic Church, a
living organism, not an organisation:
the Mystical Body of Christ. Of course,
Catholics should spread love and
truth, but, sinners as they are, may
they not hope also to receive love and
truth from Christ, “who in every re-
spect has been tempted as we are, but
without sinning”?
Certainly there are, and always have
been, “priests who have nothing to
say,” priests who are lacking in zeal,
even priests “who badly need a recon-
version”—but are priests not also sin-
ners? Only one parish priest has been
canonised in the entire history of the
Church —the Cure d’Ars.
Amid many other remarks, “Cleric”
complains that “the Church’s attitude
to the modern world is still largely
one of suspicion and bewilderment

rather than optimism and commit-
ment.” To quote Newman once more
the spectacle of the world is surely one
“to dizzy and appal.” How can the
Church be “committed” to it, deeply
infested as it is with sin, error, and
corruption? I fear that, like many an-
other man, both clerical and lay, i n

CATHERINE MACKERRAS

PUBLIC APATHY
86 Years Ago: October 15, 1880
QOME SI FA would seem to be
the chosen policy of Sydneyites.
Come si fa means, in effect, “Oh, I
can’t be bothered”; but all history
tells us that people who “can’t be
bothered” eventually get bothered in
a way they little care about. Come
si fa did not win the “battle of
Runnymede,” as our good friend
O’CONNOR called it last week at the
Masonic Hall; nor did it effect
American Independence; nor pass the
Reform Bill of ’32; nor establish
Italian Unity; nor emancipate the
French from the thralls of a corrupt
and tyrannical Court.
These considerations are of course
suggested by the remarkable apathy
displayed by the people of Sydney
anent the encroachments of late
attempted, in various directions, on
their liberties. Liberty of speech was
attacked by an attempt to gag all
public lectures not personally
approved of by the Colonial Secre-
tary, and though a public meeting
was held and a few speeches made,
the matter was allowed to drop, for
people could not be “bothered” any
further; and it was only the good
sense of the House that stifled it.
Then there was the miserable PROC-
TOR business, and again people could
not be “bothered”; and what is done?
True, a public meeting was held; but
where were the leaders, the repre-
sentatives of the people, who should
have taken part in it ? They could not
be “bothered”: come si fa had taken
possession of them. This it not as it
should be.
If a firm and united stand is not
made against these encroachments
they will take root and grow and put
out yet further ramifications, and
eventually defy eradication to any but
the most violent measures. Those who
refuse to take part in active opposi-
tion to them are sycophants, who
truckle to those in power and tacitly
proclaim their approval of these en-
croachments. Thus they are them-
selves in training for the exercise of
tyrannical rule when it shall fall to
them to use it. Let, therefore, the
electors of Sydney carefully take note
of those who, having been chosen to
protect their liberties from infringe-
ment, traitorously shirk their duties,
preferring rather the smiles of the
great, the sweets of golden promises,
and the ease of the doctrine of come
si fa.

Face of the Week
The possibility that President John-

Manila conference became a cer-
tainty that he would come for three
days before. ALP president Senator
Keeffe called for peaceful demonstra-
tions to the President “against Aus-
tralian involvement in Vietnam.’'
Earlier in the week university
students in four eastern States held

Canberra and 26 arrests in Brisbane.
Sir William Hudson said Australia
had hardly scratched the surface in
using irrigation as a food producer,

tains Authority to harness five

OCTOBER 15, 1966
Before the Interruption
TT is a fine question, who is the
more responsible for the almost
incredible emptiness of the con-
scription debate in Australia the
Government or the ALP? The ALP
continues to attack the Government
for forcing youths to go to Vietnam
when, as Alan Reid points out on
page 14, not one youth is or can
be sent unwillingly to Vietnam: at
every stage he may choose to join
the CMF instead. This applies to
aliens as well as to Australians! The
breath-taking question arises, why
on earth the Government has taken
so long to make this absolutely
clear, why it has so long allowed
the ALP, the demonstrators, the
protestors, etc., to get away with
broadcasting the widespread error
that a conscript has no choice.
There is obviously something
gravely wrong with the Govern-
ment’s sense of public relations,
but now that it has at last realised
the need to clear up misunderstand-
ing we may hope that the defence
debate will return to the real
issues being discussed before we
were, as it were, interrupted. For
example: the Government con-
tinues to issue vague statements
from time to time on the progress
of the defence build-up, but it has
offered no satisfactory explanation
of why, for several years now, the
money actually spent on defence
has turned out to be less than the
amount budgeted for. Presumably
bureaucracy is hampering defence
spending.
But the problems are not only
financial. As Peter Samuel points
out in his article on the Canungra
Jungle Training Centre in this
issue, the training of troops will
suffer unless Canberra shows more
hustle and decisiveness. At this
camp, undoubtedly one of the best
in the world, the great competence
and dedication of the staff seem
to have led to complacency at
headquarters. A huge new work-
load has recently been imposed
without more money and staff
being provided: in the long run,
therefore, morale and standards of
training are likely to suffer.
There are also problems of equip-
ment. The new light machine-gun
has proved unsuccessful in Vietnam
and is being withdrawn from
service which suggests a serious
failure in design and testing. There
is also trouble with the American
machine-gun in jungle conditions:
it is cumbersome in design, its
numerous protuberances make it
catch in vines, and there have been
a disturbing number of instances
of jamming. These are not trivial
difficulties to troops in the field.
There are also fundamental and
inadequately debated questions of
the structure of the defence build-
up. By 1970 we will have a very
large force of interceptor planes
capable of protecting the country
from the most advanced bombers;
we will have a force of incom-
parable strike planes in the F-l 1 l’s;
and the Navy will have a strong
anti-submarine force to protect
convoys. But all this has a rather
dated smell about it, since for
some years ahead we shall almost
certainly be involved in Counter-
insurgency wars of the Vietnam
and Malaysia type, which require
far more emphasis on the Army
than on the Air Force or the Navy;
our target of 10,000 combat troops
will surely have to be raised.
It is tragic that there is not an
Opposition which believes in
defence to press issues of this sort.


COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA
DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE
SERVICE IN THE CITIZEN FORCES AS AN ALTERNATIVE
TO NATIONAL SERVICE
Men who are required to register for national service may seek to serve as members of the Citizen Forces
as an alternative to rendering national service in the Regular Army Supplement under conditions which are
set out in detail in the Form N.S. 1a attached to the National Service Registration Form.
THIS AUSTRALIA
“Madam, He Does Not Have To
Go To Vietnam!”
Labor Leader Arthur Calwell has announced that the Labor Party intends to
fight the November 26 Federal elections on the related issues of conscription
and Vietnam. The Liberals have raised the interesting question: “Is there, in fact,
conscription for overseas service in Australia?”
With 1037 of the 4159 Australians
now engaged in the Vietnam struggle
National Servicemen (figures at July 27,
1966), the obvious answer to the Liberal
query is “of course there is conscrip-
tion.”
But the obvious is not always the
correct answer. Recognising that the
Labor Party will undoubtedly attempt
to make a major feature of the con-
scription issue, the Liberal Party has
supplied its candidates with a document
for use when the demonstrators put on,
as they inevitably will, their emotional
demonstrations at election meetings. The
Liberal Party document makes the point
that no Australian youth has to go to
Vietnam. He has to make a decision on
whether he will do part-time National
Service in Australia as a member of
the Citizen Military Forces or not.
If not he takes the risk that he might
be called up to serve two years as a
National Serviceman and go to Viet-
nam for 12 months’ service as part of
an integrated unity of regular troops
and National Servicemen.
In other words, there is no compul-
sion upon the youth to serve in Vietnam.
But there is a compulsion upon the
youth to make a choice between serving
in the Australian Military Forces, or
taking a risk that he might be called up
to serve militarily in the Vietnam war.
As the Liberal document puts it:
“When a 20-year-old youth (including
an alien) fills in his registration form,
he is invited to make a clear choice. He
may simply register for National Ser-
vice (a formal procedure compulsory
for all 20-year-olds) and elect to take
no alternative action.
“Alternatively, he may elect, if at the
time of registration he is already a
member of the Citizen Forces, to serve
as a member of those forces as an
alternative to National Service. Such
Citizen Forces service will be for six
years, or for five years for those who
have already completed efficiently at
least 12 months of such service prior
to registration.
“As a further alternative he may
elect, if not already a member of the
Citizen Forces, to join such forces and
to serve the requisite six years. Where
existing Citizen Forces units are not
readily accessible or where “the nature
and character” of a youth’s employ*
ment prevents him from fulfilling the
the normal service requirements of at-
tendance at night parades or weekend
bivouacs, a special unit of the CMF is
being created in each State to “pro-
vide such men with an equal oppor-
tunity of enlisting in the Citizen Forces
as an alternative to rendering National
Service.”
The Liberal document states that
these quotes are from the official form
“Service in the Citizen Forces as an
alternative to National Service,” which
is included in every registration form.
The form can be posted or delivered
to the National Service registrar 14
days after the closing date for regi-
stration.
There seemed to me there must be a
flaw in this analysis of the situation of
20-year-olds. Otherwise, Labor would
not be screaming conscription and the
Liberals would not be tamely accepting
the charge that they were imposing con-
scription of Australian youth. But the
official documents that the 20-year-olds
have to fill in tend to confirm the Liberal
analysis. The Government has not
sought to hide or soft-pedal the fact that
it is presenting the youths with a choice
not to conscript.
In the centre of the registration form
is inserted a sheet (and I am assured
After the choice off to Vietnam.
that the sheet is inserted in every form)
headed prominently “service in the Citi-
zen Forces as an alternative to National
Service” and setting out the alternative
for those who desire to take it. Even
if the youth filling in the form misses
this, in the body of the registration form
itself is a section “service in the Citizen
Forces as an alternative to National
Service.” Just to make doubly certain
there is a page of forms for those
either serving in the CMF or who
have applied to join the CMF to fill in.
The only possible flaw in this argu-
ment I could find was a paragraph in
the main registration form which reads:
“favorable consideration (for exemption
from National Service) will be given
only to men who are not members of
the Citizen Forces if there are suitable
vacancies in which they can be enlisted."
I am told that there are “suitable
vacancies” for all those who apply.
If the Liberal case is correct (and
on paper it seems to be) Government
candidates during the forthcoming
election campaign will be able to deal
more than adequately with women who
stand up and declaim, “you are con-
scripting my son for Vietnam.” They
will be in a position to hand the inter-
jector the official documents and tell
her, “Madam, he does not have to go
unless he elects to take the one-in-
seven chance of going, but to be com-
pletely sure of not going he will have
to do part-time service with the CMF
in Australia.” '
It will be interesting to .see if Labor,
particularly Labor’s Left-wing, which
is planning dramatic confrontations
between Government candidates and
emotional women as part of the elec-
tion campaign, finds a counter to the
Liberal argument that Australian
youths are not being conscripted, but
presented with a choice between serv-
ing part-time in Australia with the
CMF, or taking the risk of being called
up as National Servicemen liable to
serve in Vietnam.
ALAN REID


Republican Royal Tour
Journalists lounged against the walls of the corridor talking in the droll and
sparing manner which is their custom, and waiting. We were waiting longer than
usual, despite the fact that there had already been a half-hour postponement.
Mr. Holt is usually very punctual in
Inviting us into his room for his weekly
Press conference cum briefing. But the
fact that he had something more im-
portant than usual to say was con-
firmed when Miss Mary Newport, his
charming assistant, rather nervously
announced to the assembled crowd that
the PM will have a one-and-a-half
minute announcement for radio after
“the briefing, so if you like to get your
tapes . . .” That, of course, confirmed
the speculation that LBJ was coming
all the way as one corny comment had
it.
“All smiles today,” said Mr. Holt as
the first journalists filed in, obviously
quite elated that President Johnson
had finally been persuaded into making
the visit. Both he and ebullient Am-
bassador Ed Clark had spoken to the
President several times urging him to
come and it was finally confirmed in
a long telephone call early on Thurs-
day morning. Though Mr. Holt has
only a photograph of Harold Wilson
on the shelf behind his desk, it is obvi-
ous that Mr. Johnson is his favorite
allied leader. His famous “All-The-
Way” statement is said by people close
to him to have been an entirely spon-
taneous expression of affection and re-
spect for Lyndon Johnson the man.
So a man of Mr. Holt’s great warmth
will undobutedly have much personal
pleasure and pride in being host to the
President.
Chewing on his glasses, Mr. Holt
said diffidently that the visit was his-
toric. “I am pleased to play some part
in adding this particular chapter to the
Australian story.” Of course the visit
is highly political, and why not? Viet-
nam is the great election issue and so
the democratic process requires that
public attention should be focused as
sharply as possible on subject. What
better than the opportunity for every
Australian to see the President of the
United States in person expounding his
hopes and desires and objects and the
constraints within which his policies are
made.
IT will be a fantastic Republican
Royal Tour as well. About two hun-
dred will be in the Presidential party.
Advisers, speechwriters, aides, the
much-publicised security men, and the
odd cabinet minister or two thrown in.
Harassed American Embassy officers
talk in terms of a following of 300 jour-
nalists, and they can be obscenities, said
one official. They each expect personal
service.
Political officers will no doubt be
getting together with members of the
advance party of assistants to sum up
the local political situation so that the
President can be advised of what is
and is not tactful to say. Gallup Polls
have suggested that about two-thirds of
Australians are prepared to say they
are all the way with LBJ, including
something like 50 percent of Labor
voters, so the mass of the people will
no doubt give him a warm welcome.
Opponents of American policy will no
doubt realise the danger of further
alienating public opinion by attempts
at disrupting the tour or staging pro-
test stunts. This must be one of Mr.
Calwell’s thoughts. But the least that
can be said of most of the protesters
is that they are very sincere in their
protest and so there will undoubtedly
be plenty of stirrings.
The Communist Party will not be
found wanting. Anticipating the visit,
“Tribune” said in its editorial: “If
he comes here, Australians will know
how to demonstrate their indignation.”
Mr. Johnson’s job will be to convey the
sincerity of his desire for peace and
his corresponding determination to see
justice done. As he put it in his State
of the Union address: “War is always
the same. It is young men dying in
the fulness of promise. It is trying to
kill a man you do not know well
enough to hate. Yet as long as others
will challenge our security and test the
dearness of our beliefs with fire and
steel, then we must stand or see the
promise of two centuries tremble.”
PETER SAMUEL
Killing Adult Education
Retrenchment of academic staff because of lack of funds is an almost unheard
of event in Australian universities. But this could be only one of the results if
the Commonwealth Government goes ahead with its foreshadowed plan to with-
draw financial support for adult-education programs in the universities after the
end of the 1067-1969 triennium.
The announcement by Senator Gor-
ton last month that the Commonwealth
endorsed the approach of the Uni-
versities Commission on adult educa-
tion has so far led only to a few
politely phrased cries of dismay in
letters-to-the-editor columns in New
South Wales and one notable public
expression of agreement with the
decision in Victoria. One of the
reasons for the lack of loud disapproval
from the academics involved in adult-
education work is not their reticence
but their uncertainty as to just what
the Commonwealth’s final decision will
be.
Yet while there is little being said
, j j j
publicly the adult-education depart-
rl . 1 ~ v
ments are very worried. The Common-
wealth does not provide all the moneys
for adult education departments, but
the sums are large enough to cause con-
cern. At the University of Sydney it
amounts to about $70,000 in an annual
expenditure of $220,000 and it is the
University of Sydney’s adult-education
activities which are most vulnerable.
Even if academic members of staff
could be absorbed in other university
departments or other universities the
feeling in New South Wales both at
universities and in bodies like the
Workers Educational Association is that
i i r £ j i, i ,•
the whole future of adult education
in that State is in jeopardy and that
the decision is a retrogressive step which
will stunt the growth of adult education
throughout Australia. It is felt that
standards, innovation, experiment, and
controversy will all suffer.
In Victoria the universities play a
very marginal role in adult education
but a statutory body, the Council of
Adult Education, has a large program
of classes and activities and is the
State’s main adult-education organisa-
tion. The CAE director, Mr. Harold
Badger, has welcomed the Common-
wealth Government’s announcement.
l n some quarters in New South
Wales the announcement by Senator
Gorton is seen as a victory for the
“Badger view” of adult education. For
the differences between the States are
not just matters of approach. They are
differences which arise out of two
opposed views about the role of the
university in adult education; indeed,
about the role of the university in
society,
a sta t emen t to THE BULLETIN
last week, Mr, Badger welcomed the
decision °J *5 Commonwealth Govern-
ment and said that he hoped that it
i j .1 i j u
would mean there would be some
long overdue thought and atie ntion
directed to making proper provision
f or adu i t education in this country.”
Mr. Badger continued:
“University participation in adult
education has been most unsatisfactory
and bas j n m y o pi n i o n prevented the
universities from doing what they
should w done about the matter
because they have directed their ener-
gies to doing the wrong things. Uni-
versities are not, and should not be
encouraged to be, institutions for the

“This has been my view for many
years and it was because I had reached
this conclusion in 1946 that I left the
University of Melbourne and helped to
form the Council of Adult Education,
I have never seen any reason to change
my view and I consider that the argu-

All airlines have pilots. So why be so proud of ours? Because we know them
right from their very first plane ride. Where other airlines buy pilots,
we train them. From scratch. Even though it takes seven of our 56 plane fleet
to do it. And puts our senior captains into the instructor’s seat.
And keeps our graduate pilots in the co-pilot’s seat. For a year at least.
And logs each of our captains 10,000 hours or more, before they ever see
the flight deck of a DCB. And still they could be 5,000 hours away
from the controls. Of course, they do make the most experienced flight
engineers, navigators and first officers in the business, which is what
we are after. Exactly. But perhaps you think we’re a little extreme.
(Especially if you know how many pilots we lose to other airlines who buy
and don’t train!) But to us it’s worth it. Because it gives us an edge.

education work of the universities are
specious and unsound.”
In Mr. Badger’s view, universities
should do three main things in rela-
tion to adult education—they should
organise and conduct refresher and
other schools for their own graduates
and provide specialised courses for those
people qualified to participate in them:
they should undertake research into
adult learning: they should encourage
adult education in the way Victorian
universities do by making their re-
sources available. In practice this means
by allowing their lecturers to take
courses in their own time.
In New South Wales a tradition go-
ing back to the 19th century has led
to a completely different view of the
role of the university. The University
of Sydney, for instance, would strongly
dispute Mr. Badger’s claim by implica-
tion that its participation in adult edu-
cation has been “unsatisfactory.” For
a start it takes the completely opposite
view on what is an “appropriate func-
tion” for a university. It believes adult
education IS an appropriate function
and it has a department staffed by 17
academics engaged solely in adult-edu-
cation work. The educational program
of this department is worked out by
the university, the teaching staff
for all classes has to be approved by
the university senate, the publications
of the department, such as the widely
circulating (60,000 per fortnightly issue)
Current Affairs Bulletin are university
publications and, it is claimed,
therefore guarantee an airing of con-
troversial views less likely in a publica-
tion sponsored by a non-university
body. Last year there were 5400 en-
rolments in 177 Tutorial classes run on
a wide range of subjects. This year the
department has introduced for the first
time a three-year intensive study pro-
gram which includes ancient history,
economics, psychology, philosophy, Eng-
lish literature, political science, and the
evolution of Western civilisation.
enrolling in these courses
undertake to do the prescribed read-
ing for the 25 two-hour meetings each
year, which have the standards and
assignments of an equivalent university
course. There was a rush for enrolments.
Another advantage claimed for a uni-
versity adult education department is
that it is more likely to experiment
and innovate. Sydney University is the
only university in Australia to have
successfully run an adult - education
series on television over a number of
years. It claims that it does not dis-
sipate its efforts in organising adult
education because the administrative
work is largely handled by the Workers’
Educational Association while it handles
the educational planning and teaching
functions.
Other New South Wales universities
are also active. At the University of
New South Wales and at the University
of New England off-campus teaching
in adult education has been developed
together with the more specialised post-
graduate and extension studies. Mac-
quarie University was planning to
undertake adult-education work but
may find it difficult to do so if no funds
are available from the Commonwealth.
The final decision on the future of
adult education in the universities will
depend on the outcome of talks, prob-
ably next year, between the States, the
Universities Commission, and the Ad-
visory Committee of Advanced Educa-
tion. All universities, whether they are
very deeply involved, such as Sydney
or only marginally concerned like Mel-
bourne, are known to be opposed to the
recommendation to withdraw Federal
funds from adult education.

Security No. 2
A second security service “affair”
in as many months and allegations of
political censorship by a TV producer
who resigned from the New Zealand
Broadcasting Commission: these two
incidents last week gave the Labor
Opposition some useful ammunition
against the National Party. The national
elections, after all, are in late November.
In the latest security “affair,” students
at the Victoria University of Welling-
ton claimed that a National Party
official and a senior government ser-
vant attempted to use the resources of
Security Intelligence to smear a uni-
versity lecturer. The student paper
“Salient,” and student executives burst
into print with allegations that were
reported in the daily Press and dis-
cussed in the corridors of Parliament.
The paper reported that a Psychology
lecturer, Mr. R. Boshier had been
elected in a questionable way to the
position of Vice-President of the Uni-
versity National Club. Then, according
to the report, the National Party Head-
quarters, in an attempt to aid the
“orthodox” club members, used their
office to pry into Mr. Boshier’s back-
ground from the files of the security
service.
Mr. Boshier had taken his post in
the club without being a member or
a sympathiser of the party. In fact, he
had a wide reputation for his criticism
of the Government’s Vietnam policy.
From his position in the club he publi-
cised a motion condemning New Zea-
land’s participation in the war.
But club members, although anxious
to chase the cuckoo from their nest, did
not take kindly to the party’s tactics.
In a move that was well received in
the University, but which could lead to
the party excommunicating them, they
released the news of National Party in-
tervention. This led to extensive pub-
licity and prospects of more public
scrutiny of the role of the security
service. It illustrated the absence of ade-
quate safeguards against misuse of infor-
mation and the abuse of power. The
service has no constitutional basis and
Mr. Kirk, leader of the Labor opposi-
tion, has contrasted New Zealand with
the Australian example in urging a
statutory basis.
'pHAT was after the first incident at
Auckland University (8., Sept. 10).
It does not guarantee that his party will
make an issue out of the question in the
imminent election campaign. The new
case involves a political party’s use of
Security Intelligence information for
partisan ends; the earlier case involved
academic freedom. But both cases illus-
trate the need for a close scrutiny of
the services’ role in New Zealand.
The allegation of political censorship
in the state broadcasting monopoly
raised not only important principles of
unfettered discussion, but also the ability
of the New Zealand Broadcasting Cor-
poration, which is given a measure of
statutory independence, to resist covert
political pressure from any government.
The main figures involved include TV
producer Gordon Bick, who produced
“Compass” (a public affairs program)
and who has now alleged inter-
ference with the Corporation’s decisions;
the Director-General of Broadcasting,
Mr. G. H. Stringer who denied the
charge and the Leader of the Opposition
who has called for a full public enquiry
into the policies of the NZBC. The
final straw for Mr. Bick was the efforts
of the Under-Secretary for Finance,
Mr. R. Muldoon to scuttle a discussion
of possible price rises when the Decimal
changeover is introduced next year. The
NZBC has a policy of “all sides must
be heard” when arranging programs,
and as Mr. Muldoon refused to let
Government be represented in this
issue, the program was killed.
Bick alleged this and other inter-
ference had occurred before, and his
charges were echoed by Political Science
lecturer Dr. R. Harrison.

by your own staff to accommodate any sized products. There
should be no nuts or bolts to meddle with—they are time wasters.
PRICE. Truly efficient design produces the least expensive rack-

Every year or so somebody pricks
Victoria’s public conscience on
the Aboriginal question. Questions
are then asked in Parliament, let-
ters rush in to editors, the papers send
out a squad of feature writers, abuse
is swopped on all sides, quick action is
promised by administrators, and after
this ceremonial dance the debate dies as
suddenly as it grew.
The latest round of ceremonies was
provoked by Dr. Donald Thomson,
head of the Melbourne University
Anthropology Department, who said
that “the policy of assimilation being
interpreted by the Aborigines Welfare
Board and the Victorian Government
is a policy of extermination.”
The immediate impact of Dr. Thom-
son’s remarks was made sharper be-
cause he was baldly reported as having
said that “the Government is pursu-
ing a policy of extermination.” His
reference was mainly to Lake Tyers
Aboriginal Settlement in Gippsland,
more than 200 miles east of Treasury
Place. Last year the Government legis-
lated to close the settlement in its old
form and resettle the Aborigines there
in Gippsland towns. The settlement
was to be made a permanent reserve,
to be used only as a camping station
for transient Aborigines.
The scheme met with hostility both
from Aboriginal leaders and white
Gippsland residents, who were alarmed
by the failure of a similar assimila-
tion program in the town of Traralgon
two years earlier. The opposition was
strong enough to cause the new plan
to be abandoned. In the meantime
the Lake Tyers Settlement has been
running to seed. The small houses are
decaying, there is no running water
in them, most are bare of furniture and
filthy. Most of the men are without
jobs and those who want them cannot
get them. Many of the Aborigines
spend most of their money on cheap
liquor. Their leaders expect nothing
and hope for little. Some are resent-
ful; some are beyond it in an alcoholic
fog. Nearly all are purposeless.
A rational policy of improvement can
be based only on the resources avail-
able and the needs of the Aborigines
at Lake Tyers (now about 60 or so)
and those in the rest of the State who
want to use Lake Tyers.
The resources would seem to be:
• The 5000 acres of land at Lake
Tyers;
• The 400 head of cattle there owned
by the Government;
• The desire of some of the Aborigines
to work on the land at Lake Tyers;
* The desire of a few others to live
at Lake Tyers and work in towns
nearby.
The needs would seem to be:
* A permanent area for Aborigines
to live and work together if they wish;
* A reserve where Aborigines can visit
their blood-brothers or stay for a while
between jobs and shifts of residence.
What is clear is that there is no
quick or simple solution to the plight
of the Aborigines. They need a maxi-
mum of opportunity both economic and
social. Lake Tyers should be able to
provide permanent residence and per-
manent agricultural work for those who
are not ready or do not wish to be
assimilated into white towns and life.
The State Government must provide
the financial assistance and the social
and agricultural experts for this task.
So far it seems to have been strangely
beyond the resources of Government
and State.
While attempts at assimilation must
be encouraged, at present the
Aborigines need a permanent home of
their own where they may learn to
live and work in reasonable dignity. At
the moment Lake Tyers is a disgrace, a
grim testament to the truth of a recom-
mendation of a recent Minister for
Aboriginal Affairs: “The cemetery area
(of Lake Tyers) will be reserved in
perpetuity for Aboriginal burials.”

OVERSEAS
Vietnam’s Kemal
Whenever President Johnson orders a fresh peace offensive, such as the one
currently under way, it becomes clear that a favorable response by Hanoi would
most likely spark off a major tussle between the Americans and the South
Vietnamese Government of Air Marshal Ky.
Whenever the Americans raise hopes
of a breakthrough to peace, Marshal Ky
makes a point of publicly diminishing
them. This grim phenomenon recurred
when the latest peace offensive was
initiated from Washington. The
American Ambassador to the United
Nations, Mr. Arthur Goldberg, made
a speech which U Thant, the Secre-
tary-General, described as “very im-
portant.” In it, the Ambassador an-
nounced American willingness to sus-
pend the bombing of North Vietnam
the moment the Hanoi Government in-
dicates, publicly or privately, a willing-
ness to begin a corresponding de-
escalation. He also made it plain that
the United States feels the hitherto
vexed question of Viet Cong represen-
tation at a peace conference can be
solved without too much difficulty.
Up to now, official American talk
has been of a conference at which the
Viet Cong representatives would be
“observers.” Thus Goldberg’s remarks
marked a distinct advance. They were
followed up by Vice-President Hubert
Humphrey’s remark that the Ameri-
cans actually would recognise the Na-
tional Liberation Front as a negotiating
party.
Marshal Ky responded by emphas-
ising that as far as he was concerned
there could be no question of the NLF
being party to peace negotiations. He
regretted that some American senators
were too anxious to negotiate peace.
It is interesting, returning to Viet-
nam after some month’s absence, to
notice the difference in attitude to the
Vietnamese war among those who view
it in America and Britain and those
who view it from Saigon. In Washington
and London most talk seems to centre
on the problem of how to end the
war by getting the various parties con-
cerned together as soon as possible—
and the NLF is certainly one of the
parties concerned: how, in fact, to end
the carnage in the shortest possible
time while avoiding further escalation.
In Saigon, however, attitudes are
quite different. Here there is intransi-
gence in high places'—and an extreme
bellicosity. There is little talk in official
circles of how to reduce the conflict—
and a great deal of talk about how to
inflict still more damage on the enemy
in both South and North. The sort of
question prevailing here is: will the
Americans send troops into the Mekong
Delta area—the very heavily populated
region of the South where the Viet
Cong are well dug in but where large
scale operations seem certain to kill
ur maim Vietnamese civilians who are
already suffering considerably from air
and mortar attacks? Most people here
seem to believe they will. And no one
seems unduly concerned about the at-
tendant risk of staggering civilian
casualties.
Yet, in Washington debate rages be-
tween State Department officials and
the military on this important point.
One can see why, it is as much a
politico-psychological question as a
military one.
Again: in Saigon, Vietnamese Gov-
ernment officials seem to be urging
escalation in the shape of a ground
invasion of the demilitarised zone and
even farther north. (“The North Viet-
namese must be taught a lesson.”)
While this may not happen, the fact
that the idea is being so cavalierly can-
vassed is indicative of the emotional
climate here. Official Saigon is a region
of “hawks.”
QNE of the reasons for Saigon’s tough-
ness is clearly the new-found posi-
tion of Marshal Ky. He is now more
strongly entrenched in power than ever
before. He is evidently beginning to see
himself as Vietnam’s Kemal Ataturk.
There is not much doubt that the Ameri-
can Embassy and foreign diplomats here
see him in that role, too. It is true that
he has achieved a remarkable degree of
political stability in South Vietnam. The
Buddhist militants are in disarray or in
jail. Although one can never quite be
sure, there seems no likelihood of a
military coup against him.
With Ky in this dominant position
—and well aware of it—how will the
Americans deal with him if Hanoi
finally responds to peace feelers from
Washington? Or if the Viet Cong re-
sponds? The American Embassy here
would say that when that point comes
warm American-South Vietnamese Gov-
ernment relations will prevail over
“differences of approach.” But will they?
It still seems as if any sign from
Hanoi or willingness to talk peace could
create a political crisis in South Viet-
nam. And the question thus remains:
what would the Americans do if it
then turns out that the sole obstacle
between their desire, shared with so
many Vietnamese, for negotiations is
a handful of generals the Americans
themselves have supported? It is a
question that America’s allies who have
troops in Vietnam might reasonably be
expected to put to President Johnson
when they meet him at Manila this
month.

Asia: In Peking on China’s
National Day, Defence Minister Lin
Piao accused Russia of joining the
U.S. in “peace talk swindles” over
the Vietnam war. North Vietnam and
Russia signed a defence supplies and

You can look at the
new Sebel/Hille* chair from any angle
and still ask:
how can it be so good
and cost so little?
Because it's moulded from a completely
pew material —high-flexing-strength
polypropylene. A specially tooled
production line also minimises costs.
So the new Sebel/Hille chair can be sold
in quantities for as little as $B.OO
(£4.0.0) each. Three seat colours—
bone, charcoal, tangerine. Widely used
overseas, the Sebel/Hille has a big
future in Australia for schools,
universities, clubs, hotels, motels,
halls—wherever large quantities of
comfortable, handsome, strong and in-
expensive stacking chairs are required.

Who DID Kill Kennedy?
Two years after the Warren Commission’s report into the assassination of
President Kennedy a crucial doubt remains: was there a second assassin? The
Warren Commission said not, but as the diagrams show its answer rested on the
theory that one bullet must have hit two men —a theory that is seriously
challenged. Meanwhile, evidence that might shed light on these central problems
-—the photographs and X-rays taken at the autopsy —remains mysteriously hidden.
Iwo new books on the Warren Commission and its findings have added to the
widely circulating doubts. Mark Lane’s “Rush to Judgment” is by an American
lawyer who spearheaded the criticism of the Warren Commission even before
it presented its findings. “Inquest” is a master’s thesis which the writer, Edward
Jay Epstein, has expanded into a book.

'JpHE Warren Commission found “persuasive evidence” that the first bullet entered
the base of Kennedy’s neck and exited at the front, then passed through Con-

throat was an entrance wound, not an exit wound, produced by a shot from in front.
Epstein argues from the first FBI report of the assassination that Kennedy’s back
was pierced six inches below the collar-line (he cites Kennedy’s jacket and shirt,
drawings of which are shown above, in support of this theory) and that a downward-
directed bullet could not have exited from his throat. He suggests that the small
hole in Kennedy’s throat was caused by a fragment from the fatal bullet which
struck Kennedy’s head.

Black Power
& Whitelash
Floyd McKissick - “Black Power”
Exactly two years after Barry Gold-
water and his conservative Republican
cohorts waited in vain for the white
backlash —more appropriately, perhaps,
the whitelash—to rescue them at the
polls, the expected phenomenon has
occurred.
The Republicans are certain to be
helped substantially this November, in
the “off-year” elections for Congress,
State Governorships, and other offices,
by the dramatically swelling wave of
public revulsion against Negro riots in
the streets of northern cities, strident
demands of “Black-Power” advocates,
and the concentrated Negro push for
speedier desegregation of white schools
and neighborhoods.
Every indication points to significant
Republican gains on this issue, which
now overshadows the war in Vietnam,
growing inflation and rising prices, and
similar domestic problems, in the minds
of the American electorate.
The most recent Gallup Poll dis-
closed that the resistance of whites to
measures for the improvement of Negro
living had reached its highest point in
four years, with 52 percent of the popu-
lation now convinced that the Johnson
administration was pushing integration
“too fast.” Louis Harris, another pro-
fessional pollster, predicted on television
the other evening that the whitelash
could be decisive on November 8. It
could tear the Democratic Party apart
at the seams, said Harris, and affect
45 percent of the congressional seats
being contested.
The Republican Party’s top strategists
brought the race issue into the election
campaign this week, by releasing results
of its own public opinion survey show-
ing that 58 percent of those questioned
regarded civil rights as the predominant
issue in the election. Then former
President Eisenhower also issued one
of his rare political statements, declar-
ing that the public was “very rightly
definitely angry” about both increased
crime and violence and urging the Re-
publican Party to “take the strongest
possible position and pledge to remove
this curse.” His remarks seemed to
echo the strictures of Barry Goldwater
against “crime in the streets” during the
1964 Presidential campaign.
Bliss also attacked the Democratic
Administration for having “condoned
and encouraged disregard for law and
order.” This statement was later elab-
orated upon by the Republican leader
in the House, Representative Gerald
Ford, who recalled that Vice-President
Hubert Humphrey had said last July in
New Orleans that he might riot, too, if
forced to live in a Negro slum. Hum-
phrey has since changed his tune, and
has been pleading for “law and order”
when advocating gains for Negroes.
Actually the Republicans were but
taking a leaf out of the campaign book
of the segregationist Southern Demo-
crats, who have been scoring a series
of smashing political victories in Party
primary elections in recent months.
Victory in a Democratic primary is
virtually tantamount to victory at the
polls in the South due to the predom-
inant number of Democrats. In
Georgia, a hate-monger named Lester
Maddox, who had given up a prosper-
ous restaurant business rather than serve
Negroes, and then supplied axe-handles
to segregationist mobs, won the Demo-
cratic nomination for State Governor
in a close primary battle with an oppo-
nent committed to integration. Georgia
had been regarded a comparatively en-
lightened State, with a bright record
in school and restaurant desegrega-
tion.
JN Marylands, a traditional border
State between North and South,
George Mahoney, another foe of Negro
progress, particularly in housing, won
the Democratic nomination for State
Governor from a moderate on race
issues, Representative George Sickles.
“Your home is your castle—protect it”
was Mahoney’s battle cry, and it went
over well in the middle-class suburban
areas near Washington, D.C., and the
State’s major city of Baltimore.
In Arkansas, Jim Johnson, a founder
of the notorious White Citizens’ Coun-
cils, defeated five opponents “soft on
segregatin’ ” in the Democratic prim-
ary for Governor. In Louisiana, John
Rarick won Democratic nomination for
the House of Representatives by depict-
ing Representative James Morrison, the
incumbent in office, as an “LBJ rub-
ber stamp” and ally of the “Black-
Power” voting bloc in Congress.
Earlier in the year the South’s lead-
ing segregationist, Governor George
Wallace, of Alabama, had to retire
from office, but succeeded in getting
his wife elected in his place over nine
other candidates. Wallace has
announced he will seek the Presidency

in 1968 as a third-Party candidate,
and he is being taken with the utmost
seriousness by leaders of both major
Parties, who fear the race issue may
be even more explosive two years
hence.
The San Francisco riots shocked the
nation far more than previous racial
6utbreaks in the same pattern in Chic-
ago, Cleveland, Brooklyn, and else-
where in the North. The lovely bay
city has always been known for
liberalism in politics as in the arts and
had a good integration record. But,
like every American city, San Fran-
cisco has its Negro ghetto. The riot
started there in the classic manner—
with a policeman killing a Negro youth
who had failed to heed a summons to
halt. Then came the Molotov cock-
tails, hurled from rooftops, the snipers’
bullets from windows and doorways—•
and the massive repression by hun-
dreds of police and National Guards-
men.
This is the sickening pattern of racial
violence that has developed in recent
years. The days of Martin Luther
King’s peaceful street marches are past.
The new “Black-Power” advocates,
such as Floyd McKissick and Stokely
Carmichael, of CORE and SNNC,
and the Black Muslim extremists view
King and his non-violence movement
with contempt. Civil rights marches
no longer make news. Riots make
headlines—and widen the gulf between
black and white, which is a major goal
of those who envision a totally separ-
ate black State as the sole solution for
America’s race problem.
J)ISENCHANTMENT of white Lib-
erals has been a notable develop-
ment as the civil rights battle moved
from the South to the North, as the
Negroes demanded access to better
neighborhoods in New York and Chi-
cago and as the younger “Black-Power”
advocates displaced older leaders as
spokesmen for the Negro. Liberals of
white skin, it seemed, harbored many
of the same fears and prejudices 'hey
had once condemned in their conser-
vative brethren—particularly as regards
integrated housing. Fighting the Negro
battle in the South was one thing—but
when the fight moved into one’s own
street in the North it became some-
thing else again.
Sincere civil rights supporters of both
races have been dismayed by defection
of Liberal support for further legisla-
tion in the Senate and in local legisla-
tures. The once-powerful civil rights
lobby in Congress and the State capi-
tals has dwindled sharply in numbers
and influence. At the same time, the
spark has gone out of the drive to en-
force existing integration laws. As
Senator Jacob Javits, a lifelong fighter
for Negro rights, recently noted,
“The white resistance against riots
and ‘Black-Power’ sloganising now
threatens to extend to retrogression in
enforcing laws already on the books.

CANUNGRA
“JTC’s Business Is CRW ”
By PETER SAMUEL
THE very south-east corner of
Queensland is a rich source of
caricaturist allusions. Along the
beach is assembled all the paraphernalia
and sensuousness of the Lucky Country
at its luckiest. But just 30 miles inland
from Coolangatta and Southport—“ten
minutes in a chopper is the Army s
Jungle Training Centre, Canungra. _ It
is the Army s most prestigious and im-
portant camp. .
JTC s business is CRW, ’ they will
tell you there, meaning that they are
training men for the nasty task of
fighting counter-revolutionary warfare
in South-East Asia. “And there’s more
to JTC than Battle Wing with all its
ballyhoo. There’s Tack Wing and
Adam Wing, too.” At Canungra they
also tell you they are fed-up with the
ballyhoo. They have had five TV and
film teams through this year already,
which means there are lots more films
on the way portraying the New Go
Army, where men spend their time
scrambling up rope nets, whizzing over
creeks on flying foxes, and hurling
themselves over obstacles, all amid the
noise and smoke of simulated warfare,
while in their quieter moments they
search for poor witchetty grubs to eat.
In one film, by the way, you will
most likely see the soldiers going along
the obstacle course from finish to start
'—to provide a few in-group laughs for
the locals. “And that witchetty grub
jazz is strictly leg-pull. In war our
blokes have more important work to do
than grubbing around for food. They
can lump five days’ rations on their
backs and after that get it dropped in.”
Of course Canungra isn’t ballyhoo,
and it isn’t very new, either. It was
founded at the height of World
War II by Colohel “Bandy” Mac Do-
aid, at the time the Japanese were
moving into New Guinea. Colonel
MacDonald, who lives in the Sydney
suburb of Coogee, is a wizened little
man of 70, but the fire and pride
which made him a great wartime leader
still show through,
Brought back from a command in
thc Middle East in 1942, he was asked
to expand the Guerilla Warfare School
at Victoria’s Wilson’s Promontory
into a full-scale battle school for
troops going to fight the Japanese. He
told General Blarney it was “bloody
stupid” to train men for New Guinea
there, and, with three others, set off to
explore the Tamborine area, “the
closest rain-forest country I knew of.”
And so, in a great hurry, around
Christmas, 1942, the Canungra camp
was established as Australia’s jungle
warfare centre. There, the emphasis on
physical fitness and adapting to thick
vegetation were first laid down and
appropriate training techniques and
devices developed. “Jap ruses” were
demonstrated to troops and lectures
given with titles like “You and the
Native”—“Do not interfere with his
women, steal his pigs, or rob his gar-
den” were the first elements of what
is now described, rather pretentiously,
as winning the hearts and minds of
people. The camp quickly gained rec-
ognition, and a newspaper report as
early as April, 1943, said that it had
become “world famous,” officers from
the U.S., Canada, the Philippines, and
Britain having been sent to it. “It is
now recognised as something of an
academy of military science in the
methods best suited to fight the Jap-
anese,” the report said,
Under MacDonald some 60,000
Australians were trained at Canungra


during the war. It was closed in 1945
but reopened when the Malayan in-
surgency began in the early ’sos. It
has had a succession of distinguished
commandants, among them Colonel
Serong, who is at present a consultant
to the U.S. Army, advising on the train-
ing of Vietnamese Government special
forces. But it has been under the
present commandant, Colonel Ken
Peddle, that Canungra has become a
really big show.
Until the commitment of the Task
Force to Vietnam, Canungra trained
between 800 and 1500 men a year, the
number depending on whether there
was a Malaysian battalion going through
or not. But this year the camp’s
throughput rose eightfold and next
year it is expected that 9000 will re-
ceive one form of training or another.
The biggest, as well as the most
spectacular, part of the Centre is Battle
Wing, in charge of Lieutenant-Colonel
Joe Mann, DSO, a soldier right out
of a film set. A Company Comman-
der in Korea and a member of the
first team of Australian Vietnam
advisers, Mann is “The Boss” to his
team of officer and warrant-officer in-
structors. He supervises the courses
directly related to the Vietnam War.
Army Headquarters has recently issued
orders that every man being sent to
Vietnam must do a Canungra Battle
Wing course. Next year some 90 major
courses of an average of four weeks’
length will be given, and it is in these
that the very filmable spectaculars are
used.
QLIMBING ropes, scrambling over
obstacles, and jumping off towers is
all designed to give the “Digs” confi-
dence and toughen them physically.
They have a long day, from 5.30 a.m.
to nine or ten at night. Instead of
marching, they always run. In classes of
30 to 60 they learn a variety of the
techniques needed to fight in tropical
country. One of the cliches of the
camp is that “a picture is worth a
thousand words,” and there is a very
able demonstration company of troops
permanently encamped at Canungra
which puts on a great variety of stunts
for the trainees. In lessons on “con-
tact drills” they will ambush or be
ambushed, and in the “cordon and
search” of the mock Vietnamese vil-
lage they will provide a bit of action
by tossing a grenade simulator in the
direction of the troops, or one will dart
out of a tunnel to test the placing of
the coi'don.
About an hour is spent by each group
watching a demonstration of Viet Cong
booby traps set up in a special enclo-
sure across the river from the camp.
The instructor explains how the Viet-
namese have traditionally had to pro-
ject their villages from tigers and so
have adapted their skill in devising
animal traps to guerilla warfare. He
then shows them spiked logs set up to
fall from trees, spiked “panji” pits, and
grenades, arrows, mines, and bullets
unleashed by numerous types of trip-
wires and other triggers. After a tour
of this gallery of horrors, the troops
feel more like following the constantly
invoked instructions to keep off paths
and bridges and “keep switched on or
the Cong will get you without you ever
seeing him.”
The troops are trained to move in the
jungle out of reach of traps and ambush
points, but this requires skill in naviga-
tion. So a good deal of time is spent
learning and practising with the pris-
matic compass, identifying natural
features from maps, and developing the
bushman’s instinct for finding his way
by learning the lie of the land and
remembering trees and creeks. All this
is vital for effective patrolling and also
for the quick call-up of air and artillery
support.
Canungra has several shooting ranges,
though none with the old-fashioned
bull’s-eye type targets. Canungra’s
ranges are equipped with targets which
pop up for two or three seconds, or
move along, and balloons, bottles, and
tins to be quickly recognised and shot
at in rapid succession. The emphasis
is on the speed of reaction at' close
quarters rather than accuracy at a dis-
tance.
Such, in brief, is the nature of
Battle Wing training. In 1967 the
equivalent of five full battalions, or
4200 men, will go through Battle Wing
company by company to be trained as
units in courses lasting a month. For
a week of that month the emphasis will
be on individual fighting skills such as
shooting and fitness, the next week on
the operation of the ten-man section,
followed by a week at each of the
platoon and company levels. The
numbers of troops to be trained next
year are unprecedently large, and so the
burden of instruction is being shifted
very much on to the trainee units’
officers, who will attend special cadre
courses beforehand. In addition to this
“sub-unit” training, some 2800 rein-
forcement . and replacement troops,
picked from here and there in the Army,
will be formed into classes of 60 for
generalised battle efficiency courses. In
all, about 7000 regular troops will go
through compared with less than 5000
this year. Should the Government
decide to send more troops to Vietnam
next year, the trained men will there-
fore be available.
At the same time Canungra proceeds
with three six-week courses for Vietnam
Advisers, the number being trained
staying at 130 annually. These are the
responsibility of an unassuming, intel-
ligent young major, Jock Irvine, with
personal experience as an adviser with
the South Vietnam forces.
Battle Wing also continues to take
the usual “odds and sods” from the
RAAF, the Navy, Duntroon, the CMF,
and the Army Staff College. But the
main burden of its work is as the
finishing school for troops being
readied for Vietnam action. But, as I
was told many times, Canungra is not
only Battle Wing.
Tack Wing and Adam
Wing, too.” “Adm.” is the abbrevia-
tion for administration, and this section
of the centre trains the Army’s busi-
ness managers, the adjutants and
quartermasters. Six groups of two
dozen men each year receive intense
tuition in the business procedures in-
volved in keeping the Army moving.
Tactics Wing, under astute and articu-
late Major Vic Dobson, plays a big part
in determining the promotion prospects
of Army officers. It runs the courses
in general military tactics, which must
be passed if lieutenants are to become
captains, captains majors, and majors
colonels. In addition, there are CMF,
officer qualifying and refresher courses
—a total of about a dozen courses a
year. Tack Wing training centres on
tactical problems involving the manipu-
lation of units larger than the company,
with the stress on counter-insurgency
and limited war situations. Having
been briefed on a hypothetical military
situation in the area and given a com-
mand task, the students fly out by heli-
copter to do all the reconnaissance they
require. After an hour or so figuring
out a solution, they expound this in a
model room, learning, and proving
themselves, by a process of criticism
and self-criticism in the group.
Clearly Canungra is Australia’s most
important Army training camp and the
quality of its work and its future will
have a large bearing on the Army’s
overall performance in the years ahead.
There are, however, a number of prob-
lems.
FIRST, as a jungle training centre
Canungra is not particularly well en-
dowed with jungle, and in not so long
will be very short of this important
environmental commodity. The centre
itself covers eight square miles of vary-
ing country; from southern-type euca-
lypt and casuarina bushland through
the thick creeper-laden vegetation,
which is true jungle, to the monumen-
tal rain forest with its relatively clear
floor below a 200 ft. canopy of continu-
ous tree-top. Yet there isn’t anything
like enough in eight square miles for
training on the scale Canungra is
currently undertaking. It is fast being
shot up, walked out, and generally used
up.
It is already only possible to use

the grounds of the Centre for individual
training and elementary patrol and con-
tact drill. Training at the platoon
level and above and navigation exercises
must all be done far afield, over the
border in N.S.W. in the Roseberry and
Wiangaree State forests, a good half
day’s drive away from Canungra.
Road-building from Canungra
through the MacPherson Ranges would
make the area more accessible and re-
duce the time wasted in travelling be-
tween the camp and these outer training
areas. Even then it seems doubtful
whether they will continue to be of
very much use in five or six years’ time.
N.S.W. authorities evidently have am-
bitious plans for roads and firebreaks
through their forests and if these go
ahead there will be a greatly dimin-
ished amount of virgin rain forest avail-
able.
The best stretch of rain forest in
southern Queensland is in the Laming-
ton National Park lOO square miles
of magnificent country which spreads
out just south of Canungra and
stretches down to the N.S.W. border.
It is, however, prohibited ground.
Occasionally JTC trainees stray into
the Park and like good conservation-
ists the Park trustees kick up a great
fuss and the Canungra authorities
abjectly apologise. They issue yet
another set of orders forbidding any-
one from going anywhere near the
area. .
p the last war this was the centre’s
main training ground, but 1966 evi-
dently is peacetime. No one at Can-
ungra will say they want to be allowed
to use the Park, let alone that it should
be used for Army training. Yet they
do not deny that they are very short
of training ground, and so it becomes a
question of general community policy.
Which has the higher priority, the better
training of our soldiers or the preserva-
tion of what is undoubtedly a uniquely
beautiful sweep of virgin sub-tropical
rain forest?
This raises a second problem with
Canungra. It doesn’t have anything like
a South-East Asian climate. It has a
goodly supply of leeches, mosquitoes,
and snakes which give it some of the
appropriate hazards and discomforts.
And it is hot and quite sticky in sum-
mer. But in other seasons it isn’t re-
motely tropical or monsoonal. In winter
the temperature can drop down to a
bracing 20 degrees below.
Canungra therefore does not pro-
vide any acclimatisation. It does not
give troops experience of the intensely
humid and enervating conditions which
prevail in the areas in which they will
fight. For that the Army would have
to go to New Guinea. That might not
be good international relations in
which case the Atherton Tablelands
might be a pretty good alternative. At
the present time, however, while Can-
tmgra’s training program is being accel-
erated, any shift would be disruptive.
That should wait on the numbers
attaining a plateau.
Canungra’s third problem is accom-
modation and facilities. Fantastic

motor fuel
The development of Caltex Astron began right in the engines of cars like yours —and dozens of other well
known makes. Caltex scientists analysed the fuel needs of today’s driving. Then they developed Astron to
provide peak performance in all cars under all operating conditions. This quality is what makes Caltex
Astron different from other gasolines.
Caltex Astron keeps fuel and power systems in “go” condition, prolonging engine life and saving main-
tenance costs. Here's how:
CALTEX ASTRON CLEANS AND
PROTECTS FUEL SYSTEMS
1. Astron protection begins before you buy it. Chemical
reaction with certain metals found in storage and dis-
tribution systems can cause deterioration of ordinary
fuels. Caltex Astron contains a special metal deactiva-
tor to prevent such deterioration.
2. Astron protection of your fuel system starts in your
tank. Astron coats the walls of the tank with a thin
molecular film to prevent rust and corrosion. By using
Astron you avoid rust blockages in fuel lines, pump,
filter and carburettor.
3. Astron keeps carburettor throat and jets free from
gummy deposits that can form with other petrols. These
deposits cause stalling, uneven slow running and fuel
wastage. If deposits have formed Astron’s detergent
action will clean them out and prevent them forming
again. This action is so effective you will feel power
coming back within 2,000 miles of switching to Astron.
4. Astron’s balanced formula prevents vapour-lock
stalling your engine in summer. It also prevents car-
burettor icing in winter.
5. Astron prevents formation of zinc carbonate in car-
burettors a type of corrosion that affects the carbur-
ettor alloy.
Caltex Astron keeps fuel systems in “go”
condition
CALTEX ASTRON RENEWS AND
MAINTAINS POWER SYSTEMS
1. Astron chemically modifies combustion chamber
deposits so they will not become incandescent and
cause pre-ignition or surface ignition. Surface ignition
is a silent thief of your engine power. It causes faulty
combustion, loss of power and robs you of fuel econ-
omy. Surface ignition is also responsible for more
rapid engine wear and in some instances leads to ex-
tensive piston damage.
2. Astron treats deposits on spark plugs, greatly re-
ducing their conductivity, eliminating power-wasting,
spark leakages and misfiring. Astron keeps spark plugs
healthy, more than doubling efficient plug life.
3. Astron’s formulation ensures controlled burning of
the combustion charge so thatfull power and therefore
best possible economy of operation is achieved.
4. Astron’s composition is so balanced to deliver the
right performance for every situation

* Fast warm-up and acceleration

though it may seem, it is a fact that
the massive increase in overall military-
expenditure in the current three-year
build-up provides for no new works at
Canungra. This, despite something like
a tenfold increase in the training pro-
gram! One answer is that, since Can-
ungra is a battle training school, the
troops should “rough it,” living out in
tents, digging trench latrines, and wash-
ing in the rivers, preparing their own
food. But this suggestion hardly bears
serious examination. The scale of the
training schedule at 10,000 a year is
too great, and the poor eight square
miles of the Centre would be quickly
consumed and other training areas run
down faster.
Instructional staff, permanently liv-
ing at the centre, certainly deserve per-
manent accommodation. They are ex-
pected to work up to 70 hours a week
because of staff shortages, and they
deserve at least the facilities available
at other camps. The 1966 and 1967
build-up at Canungra was confirmed
policy in late 1965, and it could have
been anticipated perhaps as early as
December, 1964, following the general
statement of new military policy in
November of that year. Provision for
the 1967 establishment should have
been well on the way to completion by
now. In fact it is still fighting its way
through the numerous checks and
counter-checks which Canberra makes
to ensure that the taxpayers’ money is
not misused.
A $4.5-million set of buildings has
been approved by Queensland Army
authorities. This consists of four stan-
dard barrack blocks for officer trainees
and staff, about 100 houses for married
staff, lecture theatres, and model rooms
for Tactics Wing, extensions to messes
and canteens, and general utility works.
The only “luxuries” would seem to be
a gymasium, a swimming-pool, and
squash courts, all of which are to cost
about $BO,OOO. But final approval is still
not forthcoming. Not a sod has turned.
JRONICALLY, the staff shortage at
Canungra means that all the extra
accommodation and facilities will not be
needed right away in 1967. Happily,
instructors do not look like having to
live in tents.
There are more basic problems loom-
ing. There are at present insufficient
lavatories, showers, and laundries to
cater for the surge in trainee numbers
which will enter the camp in mid-
November and in February next year.
$170,000 is required for this job, but
even this money is not yet authorised,
although repeated requests have been
made. Is a lack of lavatories to hold
up Australia’s defence?
Delay on the $4.5-million building
program could just be accounted for
by doubts as to the life of Canungra
as the centre for jungle training. A
more likely explanation is that, as with
the $170,000 lavatories, it is sheer
bureaucratic inertia.
The fourth problem with peacetime
Canungra is that soldiers are going raw
into battle without having had realistic
training with live ammunition explod-
ing around them. In World War II
Canungra ran real battle inoculation
courses, aimed at getting troops used to
having things fired at them. In the
Korean War many soldiers went through
live battle training at a camp at Hara-
mura in Japan. The professionals say
that there is no substitute for such
training if tough troops are to be pro-
duced.
Safety standards also mean that
Canungra will soon have difficulty find-
ing new firing ranges, for regulations
insist on a hill 300 feet high behind
and 150 feet high at the sides. These,
some say, are unnecessary and excessive
requirements.
It is also possible to criticise the
policy which dictates that every Viet-
nam soldier without exception must do
the battle efficiency course. It is
essentially an infantry course, with most
time devoted to the navigation, patrol-
ling, and contact drills required for in-
fantrymen operating out from base.
Certainly there is a case for training
other arms —artillery, armor, engineers,
cooks, and quartermasters defensive
procedures and getting them fit. But
it seems to be overburdening an already
overloaded training system to give them
all a full infantry course.
There is a danger that a
myth of Australians as super-
soldiers is being created.
At Canungra, among men who have
fought in Vietnam and among men who
will soon go to fight there, the whole
of the parliamentary and academic de-
bate about conscription and Australia’s
Vietnam involvement seems rather un-
real. There is not a shadow of doubt
about the fact that conscription works
well as a system integrated with the
regulars and any disentanglement would
be acutely disruptive. Some of the
national servicemen told me they did •
not like being in it, though many of
these said the protesters made them feel
sick. Any romantic leftist illusions
about us being up against a wronged
peasantry, driven by indignation to
spontaneous violent protest, are soon
dispelled. Canungra’s instructors, not
realising I think what they are doing,
are able through their detailed know-
ledge of the Viet Cong to make any
such thoughts look quite ridiculous. The
only “dissent” I was able to pick up in
a week at the Camp was from a trainee
who had just completed his tour of
the VC booby traps. Laconically he
commented: “Do we have to keep on
just mucking around with these
bastards? It’s about time we put a few
great bombs on the lot of them.”
Many of the national servicemen do
not seem to regard themselves as any
different from regular enlistees. Several
of them pointed out in conversation that
the recruit who volunteers is in much
the same situation as the conscript. He
does not know in detail what he is in
for and he has v to sign up for three
years. Once that fateful step is taken
he is as much subject to orders and
compulsion as the conscript. He, too
may be forced to risk his life in war.
So the distinction between volunteer
and conscript greatly diminishes in
meaning once the original induction is
past.
There is not a breath of jingoism
about Canungra, and a suggestion that
the Government might get its Viet-
nam troops by a series of appeals to
patriotism draws a string of derisive
obscenities. There seems to be very
little left of the old belief in the value
of voluntarism.
I T is rather obvious, although few will
say anything explicit, that there
are fears among senior Army men that
the furore about the larger issues is
leading to complacency about the
quality of our troops. There is a dan-
ger that a myth of Australians as super-
soldiers is being created. Undoubtedly
they are among the best jungle-fighters
in the world and undoubtedly they go
into war as well prepared as any. Aus-
tralians often seem to have a better
blend than many of the qualities of
resignation, which allows them to make
the best out of a bad situation, and
disrespect for authority, which makes
for initiative.
So, the theory goes, they can be
made very good soldiers. And the
training is effective because it is more
individual and intensively concen-
trated on the problems of close
fighting.
There have been many deficiencies
in the performance of the Army in
Vietnam, covered up by a bizarre com-
bination of very real gallantry in the
field and good public relations at
home.
For example, patrols have clashed
with one another and got lost on occa-
sions. The use of radios and co-
ordination with air and artillery has
often been poor. At times marksman-
ship has been atrocious, one ambush
being successfully sprung but net a
single Viet Cong hit, though all were
close. Machine-guns have repeatedly
jammed and the new Owen carbine
has had to be abandoned. Logistic sup-
port has at times been poorly organised,
important items of equipment simply
not arriving. Individual instances of
deficient performance do not mean very
much. There is a certain inevitability
about teething troubles. Maybe in the
end victory in war goes to the side
that bungles least.
But we are dealing in the fate of a
select thousand, and if they are to fight
for us they deserve the very best
training and equipment. Canungra
should be enabled to live up to the
simple aim set by its founder, “Bandy’
MacDonald, “to teach men to do their
job and get back home again.”

The Radical Right
Less for Politics than for Kicks
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
QUIETLY going about the business,
or some of the business, of Gov-
ernment in Canberra and five
States, and optimistically moving to-
ward a Federal election in late Novem-
ber, the Liberal and Country Parties
seem heedless of warnings that alien
bodies are silently encroaching.
The first warning comes from that
unlikely source, the Victorian Labor
Party. Secretary Mr. Bill Hartley
claimed last week that the National
Civic Council (President, Mr. B. A.
Santamaria) for some time has been
infiltrating the Liberal Party. He
alleged that the infiltration has been
strong in the town of Ballarat, where
“an organiser who complained about it
was sacked,” and in the pre-selections
for the seats of Flinders and Gisborne.
The Country Party, he said, is being-
subverted by the NCC in the Wim-
mera, Latrobe Valley, and Riverina
districts. According to Mr. Hartley,
“the NCC’s basic aim is to set up in
Australia a type of clerical Fascist
State,” which would “repress liberty
and turn Australia into another Spain
or South Africa.”
If the NCC is Fascist-leaning, one
wonders what reserves remain in the
store of Mr. Hartley’s vocabulary to
describe another group nibbling around
the edges of the mainland government
parties, the group represented organ-
isationally by the League of Rights and
editorially by the “New Times” and
the “Australian International News Re-
view.” The recent unsuccessful opera-
tion of this eccentric band in the Liberal
pre-selection for the N.S.W. seat of
Warringah shows their growing self-
confidence, if not strength. (THE
BULLETIN, Sept. 24, Oct. 8).
In Victoria the League of Rights
may have been more successful, for
there is evidence that one Liberal MP
and at least one Liberal candidate for
the next Federal election (and fav-
orite in the betting for the seat) are
either members or fellow-travellers of
the League. In addition, Sir Wilfrid
Kent Hughes, in some ways one of
Victoria’s most distinguished politicians,
is a regular contributor to the “News
Review.” Summers are not made by
a few swallows, and there is not suf-
ficient evidence for a “Right Rides
Again” scare story; however, scat-
tered here and there over the political
plain are sufficient birds of ill-omen to
constitute an identifiable Australian
radical Right Wing.
On the extreme tip are the Fascist
migrant societies and our own in-
digenous Nazi party. Chief among the
former are the twin branches of the
Balkan Ustashi, the Croatian Libera-
tion Movement, and the Croatian
National Council. The Croatian Lib-
eration Movement was formed in
Mussolini’s Italy round 1930, as a train-
ing school for the future puppet gov-
ernment, which was to follow the Axis
invasion of Croatia and the Balkans.
This Quisling government was duly
set up in 1941 and its reign of terror
was a vicious micro-image of the rule
of the German Nazis.
At the end of the war the surviving
members of this regime fled to Argen-
tina, from where they spread their doc-
trines of nationalism, anti-semitism, and
national socialism to Croatian com-
munities throughout the world. Their
agents have established the two front
organisations which operate in Aus-
tralia. Their proclaimed long-term aims
are to work for the separation of
Croatia from Yugoslavia, to set up a
Fascist government in “liberated”
Croatia.
The disciples of the Ustashi move-
ment are only a small minority of the
Yugoslavs in this country, but they
actively work against the assimilation of
their countrymeh into Australian
society, and perpetrate minor acts of
terror in their own communities against
political opponents (whom they always
call Communists).
Immigration Department
'J'HERE are similar but weaker Fascist
societies among other migrant com-
munities, including most other Balkan
and Baltic migrant communities. Among
them are the Lithuanian Information
Alliance and the anti-Bolshevic Bloc of
Nations. They trade on nationalism,
anti-Communism, and religious loyalties,
but their influence will not survive with
much strength into the second genera-
tion. They should be adequately dealt
with by the police and the Immigration
Department, but lack of specialists in
these matters in both of these arms of
the Australian Government administra-
tion means that Fascist abuses among
our migrant groups often go undetected.
Their views are often seen in the
Sydney-based quarterly “News Digest-
International,” which prints a variety
of anti-Communist articles, some intel-
ligent and factual, others quite fan-
tastic.
Compared with the extremist
migrant groups and their publications,
our own home-grown extreme Right
is merely a small bunch of ratbags, in
the game less for politics than for
kicks. Half a dozen of them received
some in Melbourne last May Day
when their Nazi uniforms aroused the
anger of a largely Left Wing crowd on
the Yarra bank, who assaulted them
with fists, elbows, and boots.
The Aussie Nazis probably number
fewer than 20 and the less publicity
they receive the more quickly they will
fade into the night.
Moving in from the extreme Right
edge of the political spectrum and
closer to the centre one confronts the
“League of Rights,” “The New Times,”
and the “International News Review.”
Anti-semitism is an identifying feature
of each, just as it is in the more ex-
treme organisations, though it is a bold
pen which declares the fact: the angry,
well-irrigated flood of correspondence
which always follows this charge and
the inevitable counter-charges and
denials are a purposeless ritual, a paper
dance without meaning.
Eric Butler and his League of Rights
have been described often enough, but
the “Australian and International News
Review” has been circulating only since
April last year: It has been called
“extreme Right Wing” but shows little
evidence of Fascism.. It displays a
nationalism bordering on jingoism, an
anti-Communism bordering on the
obsessive, a strong suspicion of Gov-
ernment and its administrative appa-
ratus, and a firm belief in white man’s
rule in Africa.
Jewish and Left Wing critics of the
“News Review” have called it our
equivalent of the John Birch Society
journal “American Opinion.” But
this charge is not altogether correct.
One would expect extreme Right-Wing
magazines to suggest that Communists
were probably behind Harold Holt (as
the Birchites said they were behind
Eisenhower), that the United Nations
was a Commie plot, that foreign aid
was a waste of money, that the welfare
state corrupts its members, that trade
unions are a national danger, and so
on.
In fact, the “News Review” rarely
suggests these things and on most issues
adopts a conservative rather than an
extreme-Right position. However, it
does link up with the radical and rat-
bag right over South Africa, Rhodesia,
and in its not-too-s übtle anti-semitism.
The first issue brazenly declared:
“Apartheid means ‘separate develop-
ment,’ as distinct from ‘segregation,’
which is the issue in the U.S. It means
the right of one people to have a
separate identity from another. This
is the course chosen by white and black
South Africa (my italics). It believes
that the white races are superior and
likely to remain so, and that mixing
with coloreds will inevitably weaken the
breed, “mongrelise” the race, and per-
haps even kill us all off: According to
Sir Raphael Cilento, the chief editorial
influence on the magazine, Australia is
in more danger from “foreign germs
from Indonesia than from foreign
arms.”
This emotional racism spills over into
anti-semitism. The “News Review”
thought Dr. Knopfelmacher was a good
anti-Communist until it discovered that
he was a Jew. . . .

DISCRIMINATION against Abo-
rigines in country centres can have
far-reaching effects. By tradition, in
some towns white people sit in the back
stalls and dress circle at picture theatres
and Aborigines put up with the less
comfortable view of the screen from
the front stalls.
However, for stage performances
audience preference is generally for
front stalls, for which prices are also
higher. But social attitudes in country
towns are not sufficiently flexible.
When the Australian Ballet Company
was visiting some centres, Aborigines
sat —alone, of course—in the front
stalls and higher prices could be
charged only for the dress circle. So
even though the tour has been ex-
tremely successful, it is less profitable
than it might have been.

Whitehouse takes over the Chevron
Hotel, Sydney, marking the end of
the long period of receivership which
followed the collapse of the Stanley
Korman empire. If you order a late
cup of breakfast-coffee on October 31,
you might get a separate check for it.
But within weeks, the Qantas Went-
worth hotel in Chifley Square opens.
There is no set date yet, just Novem-
ber, but workmen are taking down the
protective hoardings around what has
already been christened Alcatraz, after
being roundly condemned as the most
unsightly building in Sydney. How-
ever, appearances aren’t everything and
there seems little doubt that within a
short time the Wentworth will take
over a large part of the international
and interstate traffic from the Chevron.
There has been a bit of nervous
sprucing-up at the Australia and the
Metropole, hard by the Wentworth,
lately, but the Wentworth and the
Menzies will probably share most of
the jet trade.
What may be another stroke of luck
for Qantas is that there should be a
fair number of people, trained in hotel
management to international standard,
available in Sydney. To comply with
legal requirements, all the Chevron
staff will be discharged at the takeover
and only those Mr. Whitehouse feels
he needs will be re-engaged. However,
it remains to be seen whether Mr.
Whitehouse will get many of those he
wants. The Chevron’s general manager,
Mr. Frank Christie, is at the head of
those leaving.
Most ideas of what the Whitehouse
regime will be are only report. Mr.
Whitehouse, who owns about 16 hotels
in Queensland and Northern New
South Wales, is not yet living in the
hotel and has made few pronounce-
ments about what he refers to as his
“pub,” beyond saying he intends to
run it at a profit.
He has made it clear, however, that
he intends to enlarge drinking facilities
and to change the character of the
Silver Spade, where many international
entertainers have appeared, including,
currently, Mickey Rooney. On October
29, Andy Russell finishes his season in
the Silver Spade and the veteran Ameri-
can Pat O’Brien is due to open on Octo-
ber 31, to be followed by Pearl Bailey
and Gary Marshall.
The Chevron is taking bookings
.beyond October 31, although it is
doubtful how long major entertainment
will continue. The American booking
agent, Carlos G'astel, after making it
clear in New York that he believes his
contract with the Chevron to supply
artists until 1968 was to be included
as part of any takeover agreement,
arrives in Sydney for discussions with
the parties involved.
But one way or another, the Chevron,
as Sydney has come to know it, is going.
A remarkable number of people seem to
have formed a sentimental attachment
to it. It has had a fine staff at many
levels. From the moment that the Hil-
ton people were told that the first thing
an Australian expected to see on his
dining-table was not a pitcher of ice,
but a bottle of tomato sauce or a bottle
of beer, the Chevron has had a distinc-
tively Australian character, in spite of
the “international” gloss.
It has had a lot of battles, one of
them being to keep at bay what is
euphemistically known as the “unde-
sirable element” of Kings Cross. This is
a battle Mr. Whitehouse, particularly if
he offers increased drinking facilities,
will have to continue.
But, as many people within the hotel
admit, something had to be done, and
the new management will certainly do
something. But when one thinks of Mr,
Whitehouse, in his simple Queensland
way, envisaging those acres of the
Silver Spade room filled with beer-
drinkers, profitable hour by profitable
hour, one wishes that someone had told
him about the Sydney clubs.
A Nos Moutons
M. MATHIEU MATEGOT is a Hun-
garian-born French national, who is to
design three tapestries, each 17 feet high
by 10 feet wide, for the entrance of the
new National Library being built in
Canberra. As a preliminary, M. Mate-
got has been brought to Australia for a
quick look-around to see what sort of
country he will be designing the tapes-
tries for.
His visit, of little more than a week,
might be called instant, inspiration. He
was shown Sydney (for people), North
Queensland (for sea and undersea),
Central Australia (for earth colors) and
Canberra (for Canberra).
Somewhere in this itinerary it became
clear that everywhere M. Mategot
went, discussing his tapestries (he has
designed more than 500, and from ex-
amples and slides he brought with him
they appear very beautiful and varied)
he tactfully stressed that he always
used Australian wool.
One supposes that the revival of
hand-woven tapestries in France in
the past 30 or 40 years might not really
involve any substantial increase in wool
consumption, but the N.S.W. Graziers’
Association was sufficiently excited by
M. Mategot to hold a Press conference
for him in Sydney. Like most Press
conferences these days it was attended
by a large number of people, many
of whom seemed only marginally inter-
ested in the proceedings. The rest
seemed either agricultural reporters or
those on what might be called the
cultural beat. These groups found a
curious common ground in M. Mate-
got.
The proceedings were considerably

slowed down by M. Mategot’s lack of
English.
Had M. Mategot been given carte
blanche with the tapestries for the
National Library, he was asked. Of
course. Would they be abstract in de-
sign? No, nothing he. designed was
abstract. Everything in his tapestries
was found in nature.
But, asked an agricultural reporter,
coming in with a curly one, when M.
Mategot said wool, did he mean pure-
bred Merino, comeback, or crossbred?
These distinctions proved beyond the
resources of the interpreter and little
of the fact that in Australia when you
talk about wool, you don’t mean just
any wool, and when you talk about
sheep, you don’t mean any sheep
seemed to get through to M. Mategot.
As M. Mategot was designing for
the National Library, had he read any
Australian writers? No, but he intended
to when he got back to Paris. In fact,
he said, when he returns with the tap-
estries in 18 months he expects to
speak English. What had he noticed
particularly in Australia? What would
inspire him? The landscape, the hand-
some men, the beautiful woman, the
beautiful children.
That was all very well. But, asked
the agricultural reporter, had M.
Mategot seen any sheep? “Non,” said
M. Mategot. “Non, mais je connais
le mouton.”
Mr. Alfie Watts
IN the issue of April 30, THE
BULLETIN published a story by
David McNicoll marvelling at the feats
as a duck-shooter of a well-known
Narrandera identity, Mr. Alfie Watts.
Mr. Watts has complained to Mr.
McNicoll that some aspects of the
article are capable of being understood
as indicating that Mr. Watts is impe-
cunious and neglectful of his personal
appearance. No such suggestions were
intended by the article, which was
written in praise of Mr. Watts and his
feats of marksmanship. THE BULLE-
TIN and Mr. McNicoll regret any dis-
tress caused to Mr. Watts.
Prognostications
OLD MOORE’S ALMANACK, that
end-of-year inspiration of cartoonists, is
being issued in Australia this year for
the first time. The Australian edition
gives a quick run-down on prospects for
1967 for such public figures as Joan
Sutherland, Bobby Simpson, Jack Brab-
ham, and Bob Dyer.
On political prospects, Old Moore
points out that Prime Minister Harold
Holt was born with his Sun in the
sign Leo in trine to Saturn and apply-
ing to a conjunction with Mars. The
Mars influence, according to the ex-
pert, clearly signifies his support of the
Americans in Vietnam and his decision
to bring in conscription. *
Astrologically, Arthur Calwell is less
well placed next year. He will, accord-
ing to Old Moore, be under unfavor-
able influences with not the same
strength in his vibrations as Mr. Holt.
Old Moore gives a complete rundown
on astrological prospects for the Syd-
ney Opera House, about the only view
of the project not yet put forward.
The Almanack points out that when
the decision to go ahead was made, Mars
(under which architecture comes) was
in the sign Aquarius in almost exact
trine to the planet Neptune—an out-
standing configuration,
But since then, as we all know, other
influences have been at work and Old
Moore’s prediction now is: completion
of construction during the period 1973-4
and its destruction by fire around 1982.
The Tetters of Trevor Gooseboot
(Intercepted by Will Rushton)
Dear Mother,
As I have not received any form of communication from you recently, I
imagine you are still under heavy sedation. This is for the good, as I see that
the Labor Party Conference touched on many of your blind spots and, as Dr.
Pearson has constantly reiterated, the chewing of carpets is extremely bad for
your digestive system.
Tremendous excitement here in Australia, or to be more accurate in the
Australian Press. After some initial doubt, it is now verified that Looney Bins
Johnson is coming to the Antipodes. Last week the Press was full of hypothesis.
“President Johnson is coming to Australia or not, as the case may be. Should
he come, he will be accompanied by 7000 security guards, many of whom
will be arriving shortly to check arrangements for the proposed visit, if it occurs,
which is unlikely.” There were even photographs of the type of Sydney house
from which President Johnson might well be assassinated were the visit to
take place and were such an attempt to be made at the time. There was even
an identikit portrait of a possible assassin.
Now, however, it is definite. As if he hasn’t enough Election problems of
his own, the President of the United States is coming to do three days’ house-
to-house canvassing for Mr. Holt, the little-known Prime Minister. At the time
of writing, it is uncertain what his plans will be. I imagine he will appear, like
all visiting American entertainers, on the “Tonight Show,” the “Barry Crocker
Show,” “Dita and Buzz,” and so on. He may well do an Hour Special for BP
(with a few tasteless jokes about BP and Buddhists). He will certainly meet
Mr. Holt, probably with a hearty Texan cry of “Hiya, Sir Robert!”
Anyway, Australia is full of the fact that their Great Ally, the most Powerful
Person on Earth, is on his way, or not, as the case may be.
Yours ever,
Trevor.


Fashion, out of
Mothballs, at
Randwick
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
ALAS, nothing half so exciting as
the Jean Shrimpton-Melbourne
episode to report from Ladies’
Day at Randwick last week. “Well,
it’s the wind,” explained one race-
goer. “It cramps one’s style a bit.”
All the same, there was a lot of acci-
dental knee-showing and, in some
cases, a squally gust would reveal
rather more suspender than is nor-
mally appropriate on this sort of occa-
sion.
And so there was no traditional
Left: Miss Ita Buttrose, women’s editor
of the Sydney “Daily Telegraph,” who
was judged the best-dressed woman in
an outfit valued at more than $BO in a
contest sponsored by the “Sydney
Morning Herald” at Randwick on
Ladies’ Day.
parade on the lawn of the Members’
Enclosure. Instead, everyone fore-
gathered inside and stared surreptiti-
ously at one another’s efforts. Con-
versation very quickly took a turn to
underwear, and as trade at the bar
improved, startling revelations were
made as to vests and other intimate
garments that had been hastily re-
trieved from winter mothballs.
The arrival, then, of Mrs. John
Laszlo in a sleeveless white black-
spotted silk suit was a near sensation.
Everyone said how brave she was to
wear it, and Mrs. Laszlo, welcoming
pneumonia with open goose-pimpled
arms, smiled from beneath her side-
swept white straw hat trimmed with
black and white roses in a rather
defiant way.
After a while, an alcoholic frank-
ness crept into the comments of the
clothes about, and we thought the time
had come to get a non-biased opinion
from the society column girls.
One, hatless and near-faceless in
large dark glasses, had been covering
Ladies’ Day at Randwick for nine years
and she thought this the most uninspired
one of all. The most outrageous outfit
she could remember was last year when
courage was Courreges, and a girl had
appeared in helmet, boots, visor glasses
and all. Older women had laughed, it
was cruel but that’s women for you.
No, she didn’t go around interviewing;
another girl did that. She came because
she knew who everybody was. Some-
times a new face appeared on the
scene, but not often. When it did she
removed her dark glasses and asked
their name. Goodness, no, she wasn’t
bored. She loved coming to Randwick.
Another felt a bit liverish from the
night before at the Black and White
Ball. She thought the clothes dull and
she was sick of people. People, how-
ever, were not sick of her. They were
clamoring for her presence at all kinds
of social gaiety the following week. “I
don’t normally go after publicity,” said
one woman sotto voce, “but this is
rather special. We do hope you’ll be
with us?” She will not.
However, the “Sydney Morning
Herald’s” Spring Fashion Fiesta com-
petition went on regardless, and one
judge, Mr. Gordon Adams, who flew in
specially from Melbourne, made the
labored observation that “there was
quite an excellent variety of styling
even though the weather was not con-
ducive to this sort of thing.” First prize
for the over-$BO outfit went to an
opposition journalist, Mrs. Alasdair
Macdonald, who as Miss Ita Buttrose is
women’s editor of the “Daily Tele-
graph,” clad in navy-and-white Op art
dress and coat. “I was stunned,” she
said. “I thought someone would surely
have told them who I was.” No one, on
either newspaper, gives much for her
chances on winning on October 15.
(In fact, it wasn’t the “Herald’s” week.
After the Black and White Ball the
night before, they published a photo-
graph of another opposition journalist,
myself.)
What with all this excitement, we
had quite forgotten lunch. Too late.
Everything, except champagne at $7
a bottle had gone. We were, however,
very glad to hear Sir Roden Cutler
had enjoyed his salmon, beef, straw-
berries and cream, and thought how
nice it was for his 40 or so guests in
the Queen’s room to be presented with
white leather, gold-embossed card
holders.
The Vanishing
Governor
WE thought we’d take a turn round
the floor to see if Sir Roden
Cutler had eaten all his chicken.
He had gone. Not a sign of him any-
where.
He and Lady Cutler arrived at the
Black and White Ball in tremendous
style. We had done our mingling and
exchanged greetings with groups of
friends in the foyer, and we had com-
mented on the general inelegance of
gentlemen in dinner jackets carrying
Qantas bags bulging with bottles. Some
brought their own portable ice-boxes
and were charged 40 cents for the
privilege. We had also noted who
received silver stars for their dresses
and who (name withheld) had picked
one up from the floor and pinned it to
her bosom when no one was looking.
Then we had gone through into the
Trocadero ballroom and taken our
seats at the table.
One hour later there was a sudden
and welcome roll of drums and
His Excellency, the Governor, and Lady
Cutler with their entourage walked
from one long red-carpeted end of the
ballroom to the other. The drums rolled
until the party had taken their seats
in a sitting-room-like arrangement of
sofas and chairs.
Everyone saw the Governor beauti-
fully up to that point. He and Mrs.
Marcel Dekyvere, who is President of
the Black and White Committee, sat
chatting. Drinks were served, the
dancing resumed, and then poof! no
Sir Roden. He had left.
Anyway, on with the ball. The Troc-
adero was transformed. Trellis-work
and ivy everywhere, aqua roses, silver
streamers, black-and-white-streamered
ceiling, not forgetting a tinsel cage in
the foyer which held two fluffy white
swans smothered in roses. Credit
where credit’s due: a Mr. Hayman
did the decor, a Mr. Bartram erected
the chandelier, and committee members
took five months to make the 3200
roses.
Someone later described it all as a

lavish French garden setting and said
all the ingredients for a sumptuous
party on the Riviera were provided.
The waitresses in their red woolly
cardigans would have seen the funny
side of that as they battled past steel
stackable chairs up and down the long
rows of tables. But. long before they
served our portions of butter, followed
by a goodish interval before the arrival
of bread rolls, followed by what seemed
like eternity before the arrival of luke-
warm chicken, raw tomato, cold peas
and potatoes, long, long before this, the
Dance of the Dresses took place.
This was to determine who wore
the most attractive black or white
dresses. Everyone with silver stars took
part, and some without silver stars did,
too. The single girls went on first to
the strains of “You Do Something To
Me,” followed by the matrons, whose
signature tune failed to register, but it
was something slow. Miss Cherie
Traynor won the former section in
white crepe. Mrs. Peter Hanlon, the
wife of Mrs. Dekyvere’s hairdresser,
won the latter in white chiffon. Some-
one said afterwards that neither dress
was new.
Then came the Dance of the Best
Hairstyle, which took unto itself
marrieds and singles who had previ-
ously been presented with plastic
flowers. The winner, a pretty blonde
with a name ending in “inski,” nearly
passed out at the announcement.
Hurrah—or some such exclamation —
food! Served half an hour later than
anticipated, followed a bit too soon for
our liking by the Black and White
Derby. This is a race which has some-
thing to do with cotton-reels, and I
will take the word of the society col-
umnist who reported “excitement ran
high as the 34 ‘jockeys,’ daughters or
friends of members, took their places
for the start of the race.”
The evening, however, wasn’t devoid
of all excitement. Two couples at our
table had a difference of opinion, we
had our photographs taken, an ice
bucket leaked, and we stayed on to see
if our Lucky Program might win a
prize. We missed by six.
Parliament Versus the People
By DON LIPSCOMBE
TO people outside Perth —and indeed
to many within the city the
central issue must seem ridicu-
lously inflated: should the archway of
the Old Barracks at the head of St.
Georges Terrace be torn down, or
should it be allowed to stand in the
centre of a developing freeway system?
Parliament wants it to go, the people
want it to stay.
Normally in such confrontations, the
Government can keep an ace up its
sleeve or at least hold its cards close
to its chest; in this issue all the cards
are on the table. The people are in
the unusual and edifying position of
watching the politicians squirm. There
are no final, expert opinions to be
pulled out of the hat. The man in the
street can see all that is needed to put
him on the same debating level as the
experts and politicians.
The Old Barracks, which would have
celebrated their centenary this year,
were built to house the “pensioner
guard,” the militia and police at the
time of convict transportation, men
later to become the first soldier settlers.
As town planner Professor Gordon
Stephenson points out, the Barracks
were built at the top of the hill in the
classical position of defence. For this
reason he is among those who favor
the old symbol being replaced by Parlia-
ment House, “the most important sym-
bol expressing the kind of society in
which we live.”
Everyone regrets that only the
remnants, the archway, are left. A
ring-road freeway planned 12 years ago
slices a 100-yard-wide, 35ft.-deep scar
through the hill between the Old Bar-
racks and Parliament House and
eliminates the wings that gave the arch-
way balance (although there is a color
picture of the entire structure on the
cover to the West’s telephone directory,
printed several weeks after the wings
came down). It was “sheer butchery,”
in the words of architect Julius Elischer,
the way the wings were bulldozed down
and the building was left with a bare
backside and cauliflower ears; badly
executed partial demolition, he points
out, would make any memorial in the
world look ridiculous.
The National Trust has given the
Barracks an “A” classification, that is,
of major importance, to be retained at
all costs. And the Historical Society
and the specially convened Barracks De-
fence Council has joined the fight. The
Defence Council’s chairman, Bishop
C. L. Riley, believes the Old Barracks
to be “one of the best summaries of
life in Western Australia,” in contrast
with Parliament House, “a very solid
kind of pigeon-hole in which all
Government business can be shelved.”
Argument that the Old Barracks
archway could never be aesthetically
pleasing has been countered ferociously
by Paul Ritter, Perth’s imported town
planner, who points out that he can
look at the issue without the emotion
of many of the heritage-lovers. And
he believes Parliament House can be
made to look “ten times better” with
the perspective of the archway between
it and the city.
All this boiled over politically when
the Premier, Mr. David Brand, made
the Government’s case clear with re-
markable candor. The Government
wanted the archway to go, he said. “The
Government is there to make decisions
and this is what the Government has
decided. The Barracks stand in the
way; I can’t see why our symbol of
democracy should be tucked away.”
He has commissioned a poll, which
began last week without under-
taking to bow to the majority if the
majority opposes Parliament.
M R. BRAND has stumbled uncharac-
teristically through a series of illogi-
calities and misstatements over the Bar-
racks. He has spoken at length of
democratic processes without undertak-
ing to allow democratic processes to
work. He has said the Government
stood firmly behind the National Trust
yet in this case cuts directly across the
Trust’s strongest recommendations.
Yet the people, and not the Opposi-
tion, have made the Government
squirm over this. The Opposition have
repeated the Premier’s platitudes about
symbols of democracy and in doing so
have eroded one of democracy’s most
basic regulators. They can be relied on
to vote for demolition when the
promised resolution comes before Par-
liament . . . and this makes so much
nonsense of Mr. Brand’s statement that
the people, if they didn’t like it, could
vote out the Government in 1968.
In the broader context of this naked
issue, the Premier’s supporters are dis-
turbed by evidence that he is losing
touch with the people—and they wince
as he trots out arguments as trans-
parent and unconvincing as the
emperor’s new clothes.

1969. Undoubtedly later on we will
have an Eastland, Westland, and
perhaps even a Nor’-Nor’ Eastland.
Sometimes, particularly when that
familiar bill arrives early in the
month, one gets the impression that
Myers is Melbourne and Melbourne
is Myers.
Actually, that time is not signi-
ficantly far off. Back in the grand
old days there were splendid
department stores all around Mel-
bourne, but now only the colossus
in Bourke St. matters.
One has to hand it to Myers.
While they swallow us all, it
has to be admitted they have the
enterprise. Northland already has
been an instant success. Our Myer
loving citizens fought to get out
there. On the first day 150,000
people turned up. One appreciates
the magnificence of this when one
realises that on this Tuesday, a
normal working day, Northland was
loved even more than Australian
Rules Football. You see, 47,000
more people went out there than
to the Grand Final. The parking
area, which holds 4000 cars, was
overflowing all day and Myer
directors must have been gratified
to witness the scene at 9.05 a.m.
Shirts were offered for one dollar
each and the crowd was so thick
salesmen had to throw fresh bundles
over the heads of customers to re-
stock the counters.
Your correspondent, naturally,
drove out there and on the way he
mused that the name Northland, no
doubt, was inspired by Disneyland
with the famous classic sections of
Adventureland, Frontierland, To-
morrowland, and Fantasyland.
JpiRST, from at least three miles
off, one sees the 210 ft. steel tower
with a great N on top and then it’s
just like homing in on the beacon.
Actually, it is all beautifully done.
After five miles of unrelieved ugli-
ness, Four Square store and Coca-
Cola signs along High Street and
Plenty Road, it is comforting to find
a shopping area that is not a misery
to the eye.
Unlike Chadstone, Northland is all
enclosed and completely air-condi-
tioned. So if you arrive by bus, you
come in through a covered way and
never get your feet wet. Sadly the
covered way service is not provided
for the motorist. You practically need
a motor scooter to come in from the
distant corner of the parking area.
Inside the malls are very large and
very wide. There are tubs of indoor
plants, there is piped music and
natural light comes down from clere-
story windows. In the centre court
there is a waterless fountain, which,
from the lofty ceiling down to the
floor, is made of 350 fluorescent
plastic discs and the idea is that
these shimmer and give the effect
of falling water.
Perhaps this comes under the head-
ing of Fantasyland, but some critics
complained that the Romans, the
Greeks, the Babylonians employed
the world’s greatest artists to pro-
duce water fountains, but it took
Myers to improve on water with
plastic.
so your plebeian correspon-
dent thinks the pldstic waterless
fountain is very fetching indeed and
it even ties in with the lush Spring
plastic flower counter nearby.
There’s a baby-minding centre,
there’s a bistro, there are sale-
able paintings on the mall walls,
and one can take a choice of William
Frater, Max Middleton, Joyce
Thompson, and others.
And particularly interesting, right
in the middle of the way there is a
Mr. Whippy stall. Mr. Whippy, who
has been hounded out of districts by
many a suburban council, has found
this air-conditioned Northland
haven. Mercifully he doesn’t appear
to be playing “Greensleeves.”
Another feature is a rotunda out-
side, which is nothing more than a
nice old-fashioned market with 35
stalls, where you can buy fish, meat,
fruit, cheap shoes, jewellery, Paddy’s
Market style.
The big point is, what will North-
land do to the city? Myers for years
have studied the average area of store
space per head of population, and
going on their Chadstone experience
they claim that with steady growth
of population Northland will have
no effect on the city. Actually, there
has been a slight drop in city sales
this year and it remains to be seen
whether Northland will drop sales
even further.
Flowever, the rest of the city
workers won’t complain. Already we
have demolished one city building
and spent $2.75 million to create a
city square.
Why not press on? As each depart-
ment store fails we create another
city square, so that by the time we
have Fantasyland, Adventureland,
and Tomorrowland, the city of Mel-
bourne will be utterly just
as it was in our namesake’s day.

COMMERCIAL & GENERAL ACCEPTANCE LIMITED
(Incorporated in New South Wales)
Registered Office:
CAGA House, 453 Kent Street, Sydney, N.S.W.
Chairman’s address delivered at the ninth
Annual General Meeting of members of the Company 9 September 27, 1966
I am pleased to report that the Con-
solidated Net Profit of the parent and
subsidiary Companies for the year
ended June 30, 1966, was $1,974,898
after providing $1,205,598 for Income
Tax. This compares with a net profit
after tax of $1,529,068 for the previous
year. The 1966 result includes for the
first time the figures of Australian Equity
Corporation Ltd. (AEC).
An interim dividend of 5% was paid
on March 25, 1966. This together with
the recommended final payment at the
same rate will make 10% for the year.
SHARE CAPITAL AND RESERVES
Paid up capital was increased on July
1, 1965, by the issue of 8,000,000 shares
of 5/- each at a premium of 1/3 per
share. Share premium Reserve was in-
creased by the total premium on this
issue of $1,000,000 to $2,507,916.
At June 30, 1966, the paid up capital
of $14,000,000 was supported by reserves
and unappropriated profit of $5,026,118
making shareholders’ funds of
$19,026,118.
OPERATIONS
At June 30, 1966, Gross Receivables
including the AEC Group, but after
allowing for depreciation on lease con-
tracts of $2,079,194 were $127,966,298.
Receivables increased in all categories
but lease contracts showed the strongest
rise increasing during the year from
$5,908,580 to $10,584,301.
The provisions made for all contingen-
cies are considered to be adequate. Work-
ing funds are invested in short term
transactions, whilst the amounts required
to finance the Group’s operations are
borrowed overall on long term.
Group liabilities due over the next two
years are covered three times by amounts
receivable in the same period.
FUTURE PROSPECTS
As to the prospects for the 1966/67
financial year ... it seems likely that
the rate of growth achieved by the
Company in the past will not be main-
tained. The major part of the Company’s
business is still related to the motor in-
dustry and the reduced level of activity
in that field will produce a reduction in
the volume of terms business.
The Company for some time has
entered into other fields of finance. These
operations are now producing a good
volume of profitable business and will
have the effect of cushioning the ex-
pected reduction in volume in the Con-
sumer Credit Section.
PROPERTIES
During the year a new building was
erected in Adelaide. This was opened on
May 10, 1966, by Mr. J. C. Irwin,
the Lord Mayor of Adelaide, and the
opening was attended by a representative
group of citizens. Our South Australian
business is substantial and operations in
that State are most satisfactory.
We are established in all States other
than Tasmania and progress has /been
most satisfactory and, in every / case,
profitable.
Branches in country centres continue
to show sound growth and it is pleasing
to take the Company’s services to areas
which have consistently given strong
support to CAGA.
AUSTRALIAN EQUITY
CORPORATION LTD.
As from July 1, 1965, AEC has been
a wholly-owned subsidiary.
That Company and its subsidiaries
produced a consolidated net profit after
tax of $281,102 for the year to June
30, 1966.
The planned reduction of Receivables
in this Company will continue during
the current year.
Operating efficiencies have been
achieved following standardisation of
internal systems with other Companies
in the CAGA Group.
When this Company became a wholly-
owned subsidiary of CAGA on July 1,
1965, AEC were in the process of collect-
ing accounts where the interest was not
being brought to account. Considerable
progress has been made and it is ex-
pected that all principal amounts will
be collected plus some portion of the
interest which is still not being brought
to account.
DIRECTORATE
Reference is made in the Directors’
Report to the retirement from the Board
of Sir Edward Knox, who has been a
member of the Board since the inception
of the Company. I know that you will
join the members of the Board in ex-
pressing to Sir Edward sincere gratitude
for his contribution to the success of
the Group.
As provided in the Articles of Associ-
ation, The Commercial Banking Com-
pany of Sydney Limited appointed Mr.
B. J. D. Page, who was an ordinary
Director as an appointee Director.
Sir Norman Nock who retires by
rotation at the Annual General Meeting
in accordance with the Articles of Associ-
ation, being eligible, also offers himself
for re-election.
Mr. John D. Bates, who was appointed
by the Board as an ordinary Director to
fill the casual vacancy retires and being
eligible offers himself for re-election.
GENERAL
It has been my habit to say something
of finance companies in general principle.
I say again very definitely that when
engaged in an efficient and properly
supervised business they form an essen-
tial part of modern finance and modern
living and do not lead to extravagance.
On the contrary, by utilising the
services of finance companies people are
able to enjoy the standard of living to
which they are entitled.
Few would say that a young family
with a reasonable income was not en-
titled to, in fact, did not require a motor
car. Their only chance o> ownership
in many cases is to deal witn a good
finance company.
There are many similar avenues for
the proper position of finance companies
in our social and financial structure to-
day. Their resources are used in industry
and commerce as well as by individuals,
and when the business undertaken is
high-class and efficiently administered
finance companies form an essential part
of our overall structure. Without them
our industry and social standards would
recede.
We do not seek in any way to replace
or lower the importance of the banking
system, but we do fill a need in the
modern community.
Your Company is aware of its obli-
gations to depositors and shareholders
and to the general financial framework.
While its growth has been quite rapid
it has always been aware that its trans-
actions must be fair and sound and have
regard to the general economic picture.
I would say again that without finance
companies, and I mean sound and con-
servative finance companies, the world
structure, not only that of Australia,
would face retrogression and depression.
We are an integral part of the modern
world. We use our funds in a safe and
secure manner and we feel that in doing
so we are contributing in a proper section
of today’s financial structure.
Today, as with all, we meet with severe
competition for funds and, regrettably,
at such a time, interest rates and costs
tend to rise unreasonably. We realise that
we must watch this in a conservative
way and not let the present position
take charge and place an undue
burden on those who are our good cus-
tomers. It should be realised that the
major competitors to the Finance
industry for funds are generally long-
term borrowers in large and spasmodic
amounts we borrow consistently, day
by day, for periods more suitable to the
ordinary investor or depositor.
Our position is a proper one in living
and business today although affected in
short term by factors of a spasmodic
and temporary nature.
THE COMMERCIAL BANKING
COMPANY OF SYDNEY LIMITED
I would repeat, as I did last year,
that The Commercial Banking Company
of Sydney Limited contributes a great
deal to the success of your Company
and that we are most appreciative of
the assistance given by the Officers of
the Bank.
MANAGEMENT AND STAFF
The Directors express their thanks to
the executive and staff for their effective
and loyal service during the year.
R. J. VICARS.
Chairman of Directors.

THE OTHER SEX
Words, Idle Words
“TYTHAT a suspicious pudding!” K.
W says, and the others all stop
munching and develop thought-
ful expressions on their faces as though
they are trying to remember some-
thing like antidotes to poison. Not
I. I know K.
„ T ,... , , „ ,
Its very suspicious indeed he
continues enthusiastically. May 1 have
some more?
Suspicious delicious K.’s use of
words is always stimulating. I enjoy
listening to him. .He never hesitates
for the operative word but pulls them
out like change from his pocket and,
not stopping to sort, flips in the one
that feels right. The sentence often
gets an unexpected bonus.
“I’m engaged to a dentist,” he once
told me, Next Wednesday at two.
And when I mentioned I might write a
story about him, he immediately asked
“ F T act or fnctl °n? i ,
It was piy task, when he was a
childj to take him to school for his
interview. The mistress-in-charge was
Mrs. Holmes, who showed us into a
classroom decorated with sheets of
large, loopy handwriting, profiles of the
King and Queen, nose to nose, and
patches of wheat growing in wet cotton-
wool.
“Well, K.,” said Mrs. Holmes, hav-
ing settled us into tiny seats opposite
her desk, “what kindergarten did you
attend?”
“It was a private one,” I answered
for him. “The local one was taken over
as offices, so some of us got together
and . . ”
“Thank you!” Mrs. Holmes inter-
rupted. “Thank you! I think if K.
answers, it would be better.”
So I left it to the two of them.
“Did you learn to count at your
kindergarten?” she asked.
“Yes,” said K., looking round the
room. And counted up to ten to show.
“And did you learn the letters of the
alphabet?”
“I know all of them.” And prattled
off the lot.
“And did your teacher show you
how to write the letters?”
“Yes,” he said, “I can read and
write.”
Mrs. Holmes was impressed. So was
I. Bowled nearly over.
“Let’s try, then,” she said, getting
up and chalking a capital C on the
blackboard. “What letter is that, K?”
“C” he said, pronouncing it phoneti-
cally.
RIGHT. It’s a kuh,” agreed Mrs.
Holmes, and chalked up a capital
A. “And this one?”
“A!”
“And this?”
“77” he said, glancing at the third
letter.
“That’s very good,” Mrs. Holmes de-
clared, and pointing to each letter in
turn she pronounced carefully and
phonetically, “C . . . a ... t. Now.
What does that say?”
“Feathers,” he told her.
Now, grown up, he is more cautious,
but still pleasingly reckless with words
when he is excited. Married, and rent-
ing a house, he came home late one
night and surprised a man in the garden
who made off over the fence. K. tele-
phoned the police. “You must send
someone straight away,” he shouted.
“There’s been a prawler in the garden
and my wife’s having a baby.”
The mystified police kept asking what
K. thought were stupid questions.
“I’ve told you. It was a prawler,”
he bawled, “and he just hopped over
the fence and may be in the lane. If
you hurry you might get him.”
Eventually they understood. “Oh,
you mean a prowler!”
“Prowler, prawler, whatever it is.
Anyway, one of those Creeping Toms.”
The prawler was not caught, but his
wife was not bothered by him again,
and the baby was all right, too —though
he was premature by several weeks.
“They’ve put him into one of those
human cribs,” he explained to me as
he gave me the news.
Later, I went to see him with K.
The nurses were all making a fuss over
the undersized crumpled red creature.
“He may be the smallest baby in the
hospital,” K.«said fondly. “But he’s the
populest.”

BRAMBLES
NEWS
A Story in Metal
Australian Owned — Australia Wide
Volume 3, No. 7
October, 1966
Brambles News this month tells the story of the
Manufacturing Division, illustrating major projects
and highlighting some achievements of general in-
terest. The scope of operations undertaken by the
Division, through Brambles Metal Products, W. G.
Pickrell, James Tickle & Sons and Brambles (N.Q.)
Engineering is well illustrated on this and succeed-
ing pages; demonstrating once again the vital part
which Brambles plays in supporting — through
Service — Australian industry.
The round-up of Manufacturing Division projects
begins with a story about the Bankstown Square
shopping centre in Sydney, opened late last month.
This is a $17 million project and covers 26 acres
in the heart of the most rapidly developing district
of Sydney. David Jones Limited, who have chosen
164,000 sq. ft. of the Centre to extend the family
merchandising tradition in this area, commissioned
Brambles Metal Products to supply all of the steel
shelving for storage purposes.
Brambles Metal Products manufactured and in-
stalled three-quarters of a mile of adjustable steel
shelving for David Jones, as well as 221 full length
clothing lockers.
THE VALUE OF YOUR SIGNATURE: Brambles
Metal Products have standard lines in steel office
furniture, but also custom build to any design.
Typical of this is the Customer Signature Card
Index Cabinet specially manufactured for the
Commonwealth Savings Bank to secure and give
quick access to the signatures of valued customers.




B[?]LES
MANUFACT[?]UNG IN METAL
The University of New South Wales, through its
industry service Division “Unisearch”, provides
facilities for scientific investigations into all types
of industry problems. The University has recently
completed a wind tunnel for studies of the aero-
dynamics of design of building components,
vehicles, and many other uses. Brambles have long
experience in meeting the exacting requirements
of research bodies.
W. G. Pickrell’s accent is on skill and diversity,
from the manufacture of complex fabrications for
a process industry, in all commercial metals, to
smaller items such as tankers for the man on the
land.
Air pollution is a major community problem. W. G.
Pickrell now announce their nomination by
McPherson’s Limited as a sub-contractor for the
fabrication and installation of a wide range of fume
and dust collection equipment. McPherson’s
Limited are licensees of Wheelabrator of U.S.A.
and Tilghman’s of U.K. — world names in combat-
ing air pollution. Some industrial processes re-use
part of the waste collected.
A Carbon Steel Wash Column, 57 feet high and
14’6” in diameter at its widest point, and weighing
17 tons. The column was fabricated for a large
chemical processing plant; built in sections and
assembled in the open due to its massive size.
W. G. Pickrell’s plan is to extend facilities for the
manufacture of similar units because of the increas-
ing demands being made on technical skills and
production capacity.
General purpose trailer tankers for the man on the land.
The Engineers of the North, Brambles (N.Q.)
Engineering, supply to the growing primary and
emerging secondary industry of North Queensland,
engineering manufacture to the Brambles standard
of service and quality.
Their activities are as diverse as their southern
cousins and the accompanying illustrations show
some of the more recent projects.
Mount Isa Mines Limited in north-west Queens-
land last month opened a new mining shaft to carry
men and materials almost 4,000 feet underground.
The Brambles north-Queensland Division manufac-
tured two ore skips for the new shaft. Each skip
carries 650 tons of ore per hour up the shaft from
the underground crushers. The skips demonstrate
the type of heavy fabrication work made at Towns-
ville.
Erection of steelwork by Brambles (N.Q.) En-
gineering at Collinsville, North Queensland, on a
coal washing plant.
The vast distances of North Queensland require site
crews to work far from their base. Brambles (N.Q.)
Engineering took its photograph of part of the
new vast alumina plant at Gladstone to which our
site crews made some small contribution.
A welding operation in progress on Lucinda Aqua
Ammonia Tank, 80 feet in diameter and 30 feet
high. The tank was erected by welders of Brambles
(N.Q.) Engineering.


CASTING IN METAL
Fabrication of metals is not the only way of turn-
ing out the finished product, and the story of
Brambles Manufacturing Division is rounded off
with some illustrations of work from the Newcastle
foundry of James Tickle & Sons, one of the biggest
iron foundries in Australia.
Quality of castings is all-important. This is achieved
by metallurgical and laboratory control at all stages
of production. The Tickle foundry is one of the
very few capable of producing the 10 ton unit pic-
tured. The casting measured 12’4” deep, with a
metal thickness of If”. It is an inlet end water box
component which forms part of a condensor unit for
the Munmorah Power Station in New South Wales.
Skill and diversity produce parts for steel mills
and small motor cars.
Quality control originates with the sand for mould-
ing the molten metal. The Tickle foundry is the
proud possessor of a unique and exclusive sand dry-
ing and cooling plant, designed and manufactured
by the Development and W. G. Pickrell Divisions
of Brambles.
A lacework of steel frames the two new cupola
furnaces of the latest design now installed in the
Foundry.


HOLLYWOOD
THE city of dreams is also now the
city of Watts, of ex-film actor
Ronald Reagan, hoping to gal-
lop right into the Governor’s residence.
It is a city of acute conflict where the
dreams are not only on celluloid but
also on LSD soaked into illicit lumps
of sugar obtainable in a friendly
neighborhood delicatessen. And the
deep-sleeping palace of the old Holly-
wood seems about to change.
There is a certain rattling of the
gates here, a stir among the lush semi-
tropical undergrowth. Even the beauty
herself, peroxided, immaculately eye-
lashed, lit by the glossiest cameraman
in the business, shows signs of protest —
as if she might, at any moment, wake
up and start behaving like a real, live
girl.
A good deal of the remoteness of
Hollywood in the past was simply due
to its geography. It can never have
been much of a place for everyday life,
this promised land, and that’s what
Hollywood must have seemed to those
three Old Testament prophets Jesse
Lasky, Sam Goldwyn, and Cecil B.
de Mille as they fled across the desert
from the tyranny of the Eastern Film
Trust, to establish the first studio in
an empty barn on the intersection of
Selma and Vine. The great desert and
the wide ocean protected them, the
sun shone with immaculate brightness
nine months of the year, and oranges
fell from the trees as readily as film-
struck girls were to fall from the
counter stools in Schwab’s Pharmacy.
It’s a land flowing with oil and money,
and you can understand here why
Moses became such a favorite in the
work of Mr. de Mille.
I came down from the sky, an Eng-
lish writer clutching a French farce of
the 1900 s. The last time I wrote a
film it was about Swiss Cottage, where
I lived, and to do the work I was
placed on the top floor of the Ilikai
Hotel, Honolulu. Once tangled with
the movies it’s better to let things hap-
pen and not ask too many questions.
The days when writers were abused,
spat at by Louis B. Mayer, or left in
solitary confinement for months on end
are certainly over. My own producer,
courteous and endlessly considerate, was
quite content for me to spend my time
alone with Feydeau by the pool of the
Beverly Hills Hotel. Drunk with his
present power, one Hollywood writer
drives far out into the Nevada desert
to sit at work in his air-conditioned Lin-
coln and demonstrate his independence
of the producer’s telephone.
Sometimes, however, growing lonely,
I went into the studio to see if my
script would raise a Mormon smile. I
also went to see the two progressive
writers.
They worked in collaboration, these
two writers, and they were in com-
plete agreement about everything; so
much so that one often interrupted the
other’s sentence and carried it to its
mutually agreed conclusion. They were
apologetic about their comfortable
homes. Both had been social workers.
Their office was decorated with revolu-
tionary slogans: and they were rather
shocked that no one was shocked by
them. They were in their thirties, part
of a generation which still pickets, goes
down to Watts to explain to Negro
housewives how much they’re being

cheated on the price of vegetables, and
remembers, like a childhood dream, the
name of Henry Wallace.
“At Berkeley now you see these beau-
tiful students. Young, healthy, and
really shapely, girls. But they’re
definitely cool on politics. And what’s
even more ridiculous . . .” the second
writer finished his friend’s speech regret-
fully, “they’re even cool on sex.”
The blacklist days are over, and so
are the times when the leading Left
Wing writers, denied work, were called
the “unfriendly ten.” Unlike my first
visit to Hollywood, there was no feel-
ing of fear in the air. The two pro-
gressive writers doubted if you could
actually get money for a film attacking
the war in Vietnam, although they said
people are always announcing they’re
going to try it.
Also gone are the days of the con-
veyer-belt of Hollywood productions,
when scripts were written by hacks who
never saw them after they had been
handed to the director, and films
directed by men who never saw them
once they’d gone into the cutting-rooms.
Writers are wooed and treated nomin-
ally as artists, at least before they sign
their contracts.
“These young producers talk a lot
about Jean Luc Godard before you
agree to write a film,” the first pro-
gressive writer said and, as usual, his
collaborator finished the sentence. “But
once we start work, somehow the men-
tion of Jean Luc Godard never crops
up again.”
All the same, something’s going on.
The Fox lot is busy on film produc-
tion, whereas the major studios of a
few years back had largely become foc-
tories for television serials while their
offices financed film production in
Europe. At Columbia Martin Manu-
elis, producing “Luv” with Jack Lem-
mon, said hopefully that the day of
conventional family drama was over,
because everyone can see that on tele-
vision. So “Luv” has a leading actress,
Elaine May, who looks like no one’s
idea of a film star, and an English
director, Clive Donner, apparently
happy on his first day on a Hollywood
set.
Being English, he looked about the
youngest person there. American film
unions are extremely jealous of new
entrants, and technicians there are far
older than their English counterparts.
They say, no doubt untruthfully, that
you can never track the camera too fast
in Hollywood films, in case the operator
has a heart attack and falls off.
“Think 20th!” The sign on the Fox
lot is big, bigger than the mortuary ad-
vertisement opposite the gates. I closed
my eyes and tried; but, somehow,
purely twentieth thoughts failed to
come. All around I heard sounds of
the farmyard—ducks, geese, cows wait-
ing to be called on the set of “Dr.
Dolittle.” A property man wearing
white boots and carrying a lasso ran
swiftly past after a frightened goat.
I went to dictate Feydeau’s plot, a
weird and erotic square dance, to my
secretary. She was a grey-haired lady
who lived, as far as I could understand
it, by the Mormon Temple. During
my dictation she cracked not a smile.
At the end of it she said, “You’re
French, aren’t you?”
“Why should you think that?”
“Well, I can tell. You’ve got a
foreign accent . . .”
She was right, of course. England
and France, on the other side of the
great desert, are both indistinguishably
remote.
We were in the Tunnel of Love.

banged open, and Jack Lemmon and
Elaine May came floating in in a small,

Miss May worried about her teeth,
which certainly looked more like
human teeth than the fluoride adver-
tisement mouths of the old type of
encapsulated leading ladies.

On the way back, hungry, to work
she passed a photograph of just such
a mass-produced star. “That’s what
I really wished I looked like,” she said.
“You don’t,” Jack Lemmon told her
firmly, “wish anything of the sort.
Of course he was perfectly light,
“I must go back to Hollywood be-
cause there the film stars are coming
down to being people, and the people
n 0 longer want to be film stars. So
said Andy Warhol, the sullen-looking,
creator of happen-
mgs and endless underground films.
Although it would be too much to say
that this desirable state of affairs is
universal, there are signs of it on the
horizon.
The Strip—the brashest, brightest
mile of Sunset Boulevard— caters for
all ages. First, the great hoarding “Let
Forest Lawn take care of it all.” Then
the middle-aged entertainments—the
Largo, the Body Shop, and a grim
restaurant sign which simply sa y s
“Topless. Buff. No cover. Lunch.
Dinner. Bottomless.”
For the young the “Galaxy” and the
“Whisky a Gogo,” where the groups
are so deafening, singing their English
songs, that pads and pencils are pro-
vided for conversation and where, high
above all the bright, bobbing heads, a
lonely girl in green Capris dances end-
lessly like, an electric fish in a great
glass tank.
There’s the “Trip,” where Warhol’s
group, “Plastic Inevitables,” perform to
the accompaniment of faintly sado-
masochistic films flashed on the walls,
and the sad singing of a blonde. And
advertising “No lectures on the avant-
garde. “Freak in-classes,” and “Hate
art sessions,” is Cinematheque 16, home
of the underground film.
I met an actor who had Mr. Warhol,
and about a dozen of his entourage,
living in his house. “It was terrible,”
he said. “Everywhere I went, even into
the john, or upstairs to fetch a packet
of cigarettes, or out into the kitchen
to boil soup, there he’d be filming me.
I got so sick and tired of instant cinema
that I decided to take Nico down to the
Planetarium at the other end of town,
and as we got there a voice said, ‘Would
you mind walking down those steps
again, but slower this time?’ It was
Andy making another underground
film.”
gOME of the underground films are
funny. Some—like one I saw which
combined falling leaves, naked bodies,
and the music of Scriabin —are as arty
as old Royal Academy pictures. Others
simply prove that by faithfully record-
ing life you can be as boring as life
itself. All the same, a young audience
packs into Cinematheque 16, and the
films themselves are another attempt
to break down the old cliche of Holly-
wood.
The past, of course, is always with
us. At the service station you can buy
maps of the stars’ fabulous homes and
still discover the address of Rudolph
Valentino (2 Bella Drive, Beverly
Hills), Jean Harlow, and C. Aubrey
Smith. At 1168 Cold Water Canyon,
an agent said, “Frank Sinatra still
lives like a monarch of the East.”
I went up to see some abstract
artists living in the Bel Air Palace,
which William Randolph Hearst built
for Marion Davies. The swimming-
pool surrounds the house like a moat,
but it’s cracked and empty, full of
fallen trees. We sat in the deserted
ballroom eating cinnamon toast, and
one of. the abstract artists switched on
the waterfall, producing a brown
trickle in the undergrowth outside.
“It’s wonderful to be in such a his-
torical place,” he said, hanging his
corrugated-cardboard collages on the
mural of gipsy dancers in the ballroom

“This was a home built of pure love!
You do feel that, don’t you?”
I went up to Topanga Canyon, up
past the big surf of the ocean, high
in the mountains that look like North
Italy, where the houses are built of
wood and plaster and hang perilously
to the edge of the road. “I had a bad
situation here,” said the girl who
lived there. “Two girls in a Buick,
and they must have been stoned out
of their minds, drove straight through
the wall into my bedroom. Knocked
the bed clear across the room. Since
when this house lets in air.”
“Have a little Cannabis,” said a
writer. “Very good stuff, grown near

swung over the canyon, and his

“The life here’s apart from the film
community,” said one of his friends.
“The film community tend to get up

on a tray. That’s hardly living, is it?
You know what I like to do—l like
to get high and take a joint and smoke
and get on a freeway and just drive.
In the morning I like to do that. Not
in the rush hour, of course. Man, we
have everything here—even if you ask
for an Englishman we can produce one
—Christopher Isherwood! I have
made the decision to give up writing.
How can you find a situation in'which
you can write without corrupting your
personality in some small regard?”
It was a question I was unable to
answer. At the drugstore I bought “The
Informer, 15 cents.” It has many
advertisements for, among other
things, “Instant Sex, easily activated
with warm water, mailed in plain
wrapper”-—but it is for the agony
column that I like to read it. It’s full
of liberal married couples, anxious to
meet other liberal married couples, and
young Mexicans wishing refined Ameri-
can men friends. That week an ex-
nun, fresh out of the convent and
starved of romance, was advertising for
a sincere friend.
At 7 a.m. on television the news
programs start. Three women, dressed
as for a garden party at Buckingham
Palace, flicker on to the screen to
discuss life. “I think women don’t
have to pay for psychiatry if they have
a hair color.” “Repeat each morning,
I must, I must, try to improve my
bust.” “I think Andy Warhol’s just
laughing at us.”
By the pool it’s 130 degrees and a
very beautiful girl comes to ask if I’m
interested in film production—parti-
cularly in Israel. “It seems we’re doing
a comedy there—it’s apparently called
‘Moisher Air Conditioning.’ ”
But I’m going home, back over the
desert, to England, where the issues
seem grey and blurred, the battles are
mostly over, and the sophisticated
people will realise, at the drop of a
syllable, that I’m not French at all.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Sparkling Salzburg
By PAUL FROLICH
RETURNING to Salzburg after an
absence of almost 30 years, I
found few immediately obvious
changes. Its main theme, as always,
is the music of Mozart and the presen-
tation, on rainless Sundays, of Every-
man. But Salzburg, before 1938, had
an elegant audience, made up from
well-to-do music-lovers from all parts
of the world. Today’s audiences are
rather less elegant and not quite as
cosmopolitan. Just about half the visi-
tors now are German. Many who,
before the war, had to go to Salzburg
or else spend their summers without
music are now abundantly catered for
in many other centres, some of them
less crowded than Salzburg and more
fashionable, most of them less expen-
sive.
During my few days at Salzburg, I
heard two concerts and three operas,
I saw the large “New” Festspielhaus,
renewed my acquaintance with the
smaller, older one, and with the
Mozarteum, the Residenz and the enor-
mous open-air theatre, designed pri-
marily for Max Reinhardt’s famed
“Faust” production and hewn out of
rock.
Two of the operas and both con-
certs were devoted to Mozart’s music.
The exception was Henze’s new opera,
“The Bassarids.” The Festival’s pre-
occupation with Mozart’s music suited
me very well; the Salzburg program-
ming of “II Seraglio” and “The
Marriage of Figaro” enabled me to hear
all of his major operas during my cur-
rent European trip. The first of these,
sung, of course, in the German original
text, was conducted by John Pritchard;
having taken over from Zubin Mehta,
who, by all reports, started the opera’s
season spectacularly; Pritchard invested
the gay charade with fine style and
pace. The production was enchanting;
the sets no more than hinted at Selim’s
palace, in silhouette against the sea, and
the singers delivered their arias in
front of the limelight, their faces
shaded, themselves appearing stylised
cut-outs against the brilliant blue back-
ground. The orchestral playing was
among the Vienna Philharmonic’s best
ever, brilliant and, throughout, of the
utmost accuracy and finesse.
While Pritchard and producer Gior-
gio Strehler were the heroes of the
evening, the singing and acting were
by no means negligible. Anneliese
Rothenberger excelled as Constanze, a
part which clearly suits both her voice
and her dramatic inclinations. Almost
equally good were Fernando Corena
as Osmin (despite a poor German pro-
nunciation), Fritz Wunderlich as Bel-
monte, and Reri Grist, a charming
Blondchen with a lovely voice. Michael
Heltau as Selim Pasha was at his best
in “Martern aller Arten.” It was only
Gerhard Unger, as Pedrillo, who left
me a little dissatisfied by his lack of
comic ability.
Good as this had been, it was the
Salzburg “Figaro” that turned into
the most enthralling occasion. The
orchestra was again very good, firmly
led by their principal conductor, Karl
Bohm, who, to my taste, was a little
pedestrian and lacks the dramatic in-
spiration displayed two months previ-
ously by Josef Krips in “Don Giov-
anni.” The opera was brilliantly staged
and costumed. This was a definitive
“Figaro”; not only was the production
near-perfect in every detail, but the
singing and acting were also outstand-
ing. Owing to Reri Grist’s sudden ill-
ness, Susanne’s part was taken over
by the delightful Graziella Sciutti, a
truly brilliant singer with delicious
figure, face, and voice and with man-
nerisms ideally suited to the part. As
Sciutti was the perfect comedienne, so
Claire Watson, as the Countess, was
the grand tragedienne; though, at
times, one suspected a certain lack of
temperament, her wonderful voice, in
big dramatic outbursts, as when care-
fully controlled, brought her moments
of great triumph in “Porgi amor” and
“Dove sono.” Almost on a level with
these two remarkable singers was Edith
Mathis, a charming Cherubino, who
delivered “Voi che sapete” with utter
assurance. The best of the men was no
dpubt Geraint Evans as Figaro, but I
found him to be less than perfect vocally
because of unfamiliar emphases and
some oddly placed melodic accents.
The rest of my Salzburg Mozart
listening was two concerts. One, con-
ducted by the Mozarteum director and
great musicologist Bernhard Paum-
gartner, was given by the Camerata
Academica of the Mozarteum, an ad-
hoc group which included many of the
Mozarteum’s youthful professors. The
good doctor is not an outstanding con-
ductor; aristocratically negligent, he
often gives no beat at all for lengthy
stretches, his indications, of any kind,
are extremely sketchy, and his methods
could have wrought havoc with any
body of less disciplined and competent
players. It was only right at the end
of the concert, in the B flat symphony
KV 319, that Paumgartner suddenly
seemed to become interested and he
then delivered a simply brilliant Allegro,
skipping, even dancing, to conclude
the concert, which had also included
the early KV 181 symphony. I was far
happier about the central section of the
program, which introduced pianist Jorg-
Demus and bassist Tugomir Franc.
Demus, whose Schubert recording I’ve
loved for years, and who has now made
wonderful tapes of Debussy’s music for
“Angelicum” of Milan, proved a con-
vincing spokesman for Mozart’s E flat
major concerto, KV 482. He is still a
young man and European listeners know
him best as regular accompanist for
both Fischer-Dieskau and Schwarzkopf;
his playing, compared for instance to
that of Lily Kraus, seemed a little lack-
ing in virility and the more obvious
poetry, but this was amply compensated
by his outstanding sensitivity, delicacy,
and clean touch.
Mr. Franc, who sang two Recitatives
and Arias (KV 432 and 512), is the
possessor and controller of a simply
enormous bass voice, a true bass which
is at its best at the bottom of the range.
He modulates this remarkable voice
excellently at all times and is, in my
opinion, a far finer singer than Kim.

Borg, to whom I have heard him
compared.
The only other Mozart I heard was
at a final rehearsal (the concert itself
being booked out) by the Mozarteum
Orchestra —Salzburg’s own permanent
orchestra, throughout the year—con-
ducted by Carlo Zecchi. When Zecchi
visited Australia a couple of years ago,
I regarded him as a somewhat inade-
quate conductor and under the condi-
tions of such a tour —excessive travel,
Collegium Musicum of Zurich play-
ing on a platform built over an arti-
ficial lake in the shadow of the Lion
Monument, Lucerne.
insufficient rehearsals, varying orchestral
standards, and language difficulties—l
might well find him inadequate again.
Given a program of his choice (he
claims to specialise in Mozart) and a
body of very competent players who
stay together whatever happens, he was
able to prove his exceptional sensitivity
and his talent for getting the best out
of a bunch of rather touchy individu-
alists who clearly respect his knowledge
and thoughtfulness.
Hans Werner Henze’s opera “The
Bassarids” is not a work easily fitted
into the existing scheme of things
operatic. Set to a text by W. H. Auden
and Chester Kallmann translated into
German for Salzburg, compounded of
symbolism and imagery, it is based on
Euripides’ incomplete “Bacchantes”
and I have no doubt that it contains
some of the composer’s finest dramatic
music. The libretto, which I studied
thoroughly in both languages, is both
harrowing and poetic, but unfortunately
very little of this can be heard as, for
much of the time, several performers
sing different lines simultaneously, the
orchestra plays something different
again, the action is obscure to any who
have not read the libretto repeatedly,
and, to top all, the acoustics of the
new Grosse Festspielhaus (it must seat
well over 2000) achieved some rather
peculiar effects.
The opera in one Act, with an Inter-
mezzo, is performed without a break
and I feel that no ordinary audience
should be expected to suffer over two
hours of obscurity without the relief of
an interval.
On this occasion, the audience was
as grand as anyone could wish, but few
of them went away thoroughly satisfied.
The best music in the opera is the
orchestra’s, and the Vienna Philhar-
monic played wonderfully well under
Christoph von Dohnanyi’s relentless
direction, building up to simply terrify-
ing crescendi of winds and percussion.
These sections had been specially rein-
forced for the work in which the strings
play a rather subordinate part through-
out. The production was not, in every
respect, exactly what the meticulously
detailed author’s instructions called for,
but it was gripping and terrifying
enough for all that. Purged by enor-
mous volumes of sound, impressed by
the singing outstanding were Loren
Driscoll, Kostas Paskalis, William
Dooley, Kerstin Meyer, and Ingebord
Hallstein—and the standard of acting,
I emerged thoroughly shaken.
The final musical engagement of my
European jaunt was at the Inter-
national Festival of Music, Lucerne.
The Festival lasts for 26 days and the
list of artists engaged for it was a very
impressive one; during my three days'
stay I could, regrettably, hear but little,
Most of the Festival’s fixtures are
housed in the Kunsthaus, a restrainedly
modern and quite attractive concert
hall seating some 1400 listeners in good
comfort and with fair acoustics,
In this hall, I heard an amazingly
fine concert given by the Cincinnati
Symphony Orchestra under their per-
manent conductor, Max Rudolf. This
amiable gentleman proved to be a very
firm and wholly musicianly director,

gave us William Schuman’s “NeTy Eng-

McWilliam’s Lexia, recently intro-
duced to the Australian market, is a
distinctive, dry white table wine
which could not be exhibited in any
Australian Wine show, because there
was. no classification for this new
variety.
McWilliam’s, therefore, entered it
overseas, and are justifiably proud of
receiving a top Gold Medal award.
In the short time it has been available,
this wine has received considerable
acclaim. McWilliam’s Lexia is made
from the grape variety know as Lexia,
and was produced at McWilliam’s
Robinvale Winery in Victoria.
During fermentation the temperature
was maintained below 55° F., and
this has helped to retain in the wine
a very powerful aroma of the grape,
as well as a tremendous volume of
flavour. This light, dry white table
wine is an ideal accompaniment to
most foods, particularly seasoned fish
dishes, white meats and poultry.
Other successes at Ljubljana for
McWilliam’s included Gold Medals

loosely based on the work of the 18th
century American composer William
Billings, this work was new to me.
Some of Schuman’s music is said to be
fairly difficult, but this suite is simply
attractive, easy on the ear, and quite
uncomplicated.
The first concert of my stay at
Lucerne was given in the almost r magi-
cal setting of the Lion Monument. With
the audience seated under the open
night sky, facing a small artificial lake,
we listened to the Collegium Musicum
of Zurich, conducted by the renowned
Paul Sacher, with soloist Agnes Giebel.
The performers were on a platform
erected over the water, which separated
them from the audience, perhaps to
the detriment of clear sound, at the
foot of Lucerne’s Lion, carved into the
face of a soaring cliff of rock. The first-
rate string and wind ensemble included
Brenton Langbein and two other mem-
bers of the Kammermusiker who toured
Australia earlier this year and so en-
livened the Mittagong Easter Festival
I was indeed happy to renew
acquaintance with them over a glass of
excellent wine. The setting was wonder-
ful, the playing was good, but the pro-
gram (though wholly devoted to
Mozart) somewhat dull.

Call It What You Like. ABC-TV.
IT is a long time since those musicals
in which, traditionally, every song
had to be preceded by a spot of
conversation with a key word in it, no
matter how ineptly placed. Such a
long time that someone at ABC-TV
may believe it’s a new idea, suitable for
use in “Be Our Guest,” one of the
much-publicised new afternoon shows
grouped under the general title of
“Take It Easy,” both such normal,
corny ABC-type names that they en-
tirely belie all the mod implications
which surround them.
“Be Our Guest,” in a motel setting,
has Lorraine Bayly, Gordon Glen-
wright, and Jack Allan, of the older
generation, Sean Scully and Jackie
Weaver as the younger.
The premiere last week began with
Sean Scully involved boyishly in some
“business” with luggage of The Flana-
gans, which led to someone mentioning
waking up in the morning, which led
The Flanagans to put their heads to-
gether to sing a song of that name. A
different but equally tottery method
was used to work Normie Rowe into
the action. Switchgirl Jackie Weaver
got a wrong number, refused to believe
it was guest Normie until he proved
it by lying on his bed and singing
into the telephone, with the backing
of a group and organ apparently wired
into the woodwork.
An ABC voice invited the audience
to "Be Our Guest” tomorrow at 3.30.
Sir, no thanks. If this foolishness is
“family entertainment,” I am only
moved to wonder what kind of family
the ABC has in mind? The show seems
only worth viewing as an example of
how wrong the ABC is to chase the
ratings chimera.
The resultant conflict could be the
reason why, in “Australian Playhouse”
recently, Tony Morphett’s drama
“Objector” had a narrator speaking one
moment of “the unfamiliar, improbable
taste of blood in the mouth,” while
the youth, slapped across the face by
his father, reacted with “Lay off me,
why doncha?” The play kept wander-
ing from prose poetry to plain Aus-
tralian and back again, like a novice
punter trying to pick a two-horse race
without a form guide. As noted in
these pages last week, Tony Morphett
works for—and within the special
atmosphere of —the ABC.
Among the chiding must be another
example of failing to mention a good,
new imported show in ABC publicity.
This is the BBC’s “Call It What You
Like,” now visible on ABC-TV in
several States at 9.30 one night
or another. It is British humor verging
on satire, similar to but not as
“naughty” as “Mavis Bramston.” Most
of the sketches are very funny, very
well done. Perhaps it is ABC policy
to publicise only new local material,
likely to be condemned by those awful
reviewers and needing Mother’s help,
while the Awful Press can be depended
on to publicise the better shows?

case no leniency can be considered, since
troop morale is dangerously low.
Losey shows no actual fighting (which
even in an anti-war film has a way of
looking romantic), merely sketching in
the filth and carnage with official still
photographs; his grainy photography
carefully avoids any hint of patriotism
or heroics. Tom Courtenay makes
Hamp an extraordinarily moving figure
—■dim, trusting, civil, and subservient to
his “betters” even in extremis and
Dirk Bogarde’s unselfish performance
as the defence counsel makes its own
impact without trying to steal Court-
enay’s thunder.
A film of considerable quiet charm,
“All the Way Home” is belatedly re-
leased here and then tucked away un-
obtrusively as the wrong half of a
double bill. Based on James Agee’s
novel “A Death in the Family,” it is
the simple story of an ordinary family
disrupted by the father’s accidental
death, and of the painful beginnings of
adjustment to loss by his wife and child.
Alex Segal’s direction is unnecessarily
elegiac even in the happy early
sequences, but he conveys in a beguiling
way the cosy domestic atmosphere of
half a century back; and Jean Simmons
and Robert Preston, actors of astonish-
ing warmth, strength, and sensitivity,
bring authenticity to what is a genuine
love story of people who bicker and
differ, whose principles and ideas are
often opposed but whose love and inter-
dependence is enduring.
There is no such conviction in “The
Slender Thread,” an efficiently made
film about a Lifeline-style organisation
(pompously called Crisis Clinic) which
gets a telephone call from a woman
who has taken poison. While the
clinic tries to trace the call, the would-
be suicide garrulously explains that the
husband has become estranged from
her on finding out about a premarital
indiscretion. Actually the husband
(seen in flashback) looks like such a
sanctimonious prig that he’d be a small
loss.
The whole thing has the sentimen-
tality and trumped-up drama of a
“Reader’s Digest” article, and even
such capable actors as Anne Bancroft
and Sidney Poitier can’t really salvage
it.

Talent Submerged
Balson, Crowley, Fizelle, Hinder. Art
Gallery of N.S.W.
Nancv Borlase. Macquarie Galleries,
Sydney.
AN exhibition of the pioneer ab-
stractionists Fizelle, Crowley,
Hinder, and Balson, in one of the
very few theme shows mounted by the
N.S.W. Gallery, and a show by Nancy
Borlase, a kindred spirit, at the Mac-
quarie, brings to the surface a con-
sistent movement almost drowned by
neglect and the advent of abstract ex-
pressionism in 1956, which behaved, in
word and deed, as though no other ab-
straction had happened in Australia.
The action painter, espousing spon-
taneous automatism and the instant-
personality gesture, had no time for an
art derived from Metzinger, Lhote,
Gleizes, and Marcoussis, an art of
frontal forms, quiet color, flat patterns,
and shallow space.
Lhote and Gleizes, who influenced
Fizelle and Crowley, and through them
Balson, have been criticised for retreat-
ing from pure cubism to a realist
imagery modified by cubism and termed
by Herbert Read cubist academicism.
Locally, only Fizelle, however, remained
addicted to monumental nudes in
decorous fawns and creams in the man-
ner of Lhote and Gleizes, but even he,
in 1960, when illness forced him to stop
painting before he died in 1964, came
close to pure abstraction in a gloomy,
grey improvisation on a staircase.
Crowley, Hinder, and Balson by the
late ’forties were purely abstract and
were showing what was meant by dyna-
mic and architectonic forces with an

untroubled, unforced skill that makes a
lot of present, local hard-edge look
flaccid and contrived. By 1947 Grace
Crowley was creating a set of purely
abstract and joyously ecstatic color-
shape arrangements; in 1945 Balson
painted a work that presaged much of
the hard-edge and optical modes. He
was to turn briefly to Pollock’s tote-
mic period with broad floods of Indian
red and white on blue, and finally, in
what now appears as among our fine
abstractions, paintings like veils of con-
fetti, of finely fragmented surfaces, pul-
sating like a Mark Tobey, without
points of emphasis, far removed from
their cubist origins and, escaping from
straitjacketed restrictions, gently
panting with new-won freedom.
Without this show, accompanied by a
fine catalogue, and Daniel Thomas’
piece in “Art and Australia” in 1965
one sees how easily a real talent could
be submerged by the popsters and hard-
edgers.
Hard-edgers should find something in
Hinder; he has always been concerned
with linear drive and the expansion of
masses, though his color has remained
thin and cool rather than dense and
radiant in the manner of hard-edge
painting. His is a varied and meticu-
lous talent, and influences range from
the isolated and severe forms of Kan-
dinsky and Malevitch to the kaleido-
scopic overlapping of colors and forms
in a style akin to Marc’s or Feinin-
ger’s.
W HAT impresses about Hinder and
his fellow pioneers is the amalgam
of intellectual analysis and sheer sensi-
bility; what warns is the general lack
of recognition they received and how
war and fashion and a mushroom gen-
eration of artists can obscure talented
contributions.
Nancy Borlase is not a fashionable
painter: the colors are almost drab, look
worn, wan, and subdued; there are no
hypnotic images, pop or abstract, iso-
lated in uniform areas of paint, to
petrify you. Her work swarms with
abstract patterns derived mainly from
water, rocks, and, especially, sinuous
boughs and serpentine leaves. The pat-
terns, flat and shallow, and the color,
dehydrated and restrained, have that
air of lushness frustrated that is typical
of Sydney’s coast.
Gone are her earlier, closely im-
pacted circles and oblong areas that
used to interlock with a tough inevi-
tability.
Now the elongated, willow-leaf forms
and sinuous streams twist and swirl
over the whole surface as though
caught in an eddy; some writhe as
though in a vortex. Emblem is a flat
maelstrom with happy calmness at the
edges, and Visitation a quite splendid
accumulation of interpenetrating shapes
overlapping a bit like a Whiteley but
without any of his flaccidity or whim-
sicality. In fact, Nancy Borlase is dead
serious, and her intensity gave the show,
to cursory glances, a monotony, but
second looks revealed that the exhibi-

Thomas. Jane Strek, Sydney.
DYLAN THOMAS the poet was
also the Poet or Artist of popular
legend—a roistering bohemian,
devoted to whisky and women, for
whom life was one long party. This
is the Dylan Thomas of “Dylan,” which
is based on John Malcolm Brinnin’s
“Dylan Thomas in America,” a Bos-
wellian record of the poet’s four visits
to America, and on Caitlin Thomas’
“Leftover Life to Kill.”
The play is merely a succession of
incidents strung together from Brin-
nin’s book. But, in spite of the fact that
Sidney Michaels vulgarises and distorts
these episodes for the sake of fairly
cheap theatrical effects, he does man-
age to reproduce enough of the wit
and eloquence of Dylan Thomas in the
dialogue to carry the play along in the
theatre.
“Dylan” is, first and foremost, a
vehicle for the actor who plays the title
role. Fortunately, in Peter O’Shaugh-
nessy, the Independent production has
an actor who is able to play the part
with outstanding success. Mr. O’Shaugh-
nessy is well suited to portray Thomas’
eloquence, wit, flamboyance, and his-
trionic ability, but the strength of his
performance lies in the complexity he
gives to the character. When I heard
Dylan Thomas give a poetry reading
l n Oxford in 1952, what struck me,
apart from his charm, were his mod-
esty> informality, and self-depiecating
humor. Peter O Shaughnessy shows
these many sides of the man as well as
the drunken roisterer.
He is strongly supported by Marcella
Burgoyne as the fierce, wild, beautiful
Caitlin, who, as she says in “Leftover
Life to Kill,” was more a natural
“ r
ters the production, like the play and
no doubt partly because or it, is oiten
makeshift. s

Han Play Season begins with three short

and presentable dramatic exercise.
“The Currency Lass” is a musical
comedy written in the style fashion-
able in 1844, while “I’ve Come about
the Assassination” and “The Pier” are
comedies of the absurd or black
comedies written in the style fashion-
able in 1966.
“The Currency Lass” is a comedy of
errors which begins when Edward Stan-
ford writes to his uncle in England
that he is engaged to marry a native
girl in Sydney. “I’ve Come about the
Assassination” is a political farce in
which a young Hamlet in black leather
is unable to make up his mind to kill
his father, who was yesterday’s revolu-
tionary leader and is tyrant,
“The Pier” is about a couple of per-
verts called Sidney and Keppell. Sid-
ney has spent the past 21 years in
hed in his furnished room devouring
oranges, not daring to go out for fear
he might yield to his compulsion. The
solicitous Keppell visits him regularly
to replenish the oranges,
Friends at the theatre were evenly
divided in preference for the old and
the new. I preferred the period charm,
the songs, and the presentation of “The
Currency Lass,” which is directed by
Robin Love joy with a much surer
hand than he applies to the two modern
plays. Gaye Anderson plays the Cur-
rency Lass with delightful virtuosity
and Edward Hepple gives a neat per-
formance as Uncle Samuel Simile, “a
devotee to dramatic composition.”
A light touch is also necessary, in
my opinion, for playing comedy of the
absurd. The whole point surely is for
the characters to seem natural although
they are behaving absurdly or neurotic-
ally. Rob Inglis gets it right in “The
Pier” with a well-observed sketch of
the heavily solicitous Central European
Keppell.
MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Genet’s Reality
The Maids. Genet; A Slight Ache.
Pinter. Sheridan, Adelaide.
GENET often appears more
Sartrean than Sartre, and per-
haps that is why Sartre wrote a
book about him. Solange and Claire
are seen right at the peak of a Sartrean
situation: are they only “things”
called Maids, or can they transcend
the imposed definition, which is also
sometimes their own? They play at
being “Madame,” but it is not the solu-
tion, since Madame herself is only play-
ing at being Madame. Death is no
solution, either, although Claire chooses
this as her way out finally, and thus
gives Solange the new definition of
Murderess. No one is quite real, every-
one is acting a role imposed from the
outside. The only answer is an in-
human, almost impossible, honesty,
which is the Sartrean point Genet does
not allow his Maids to reach.
Pinter’s “A Slight Ache” can enter-
tain and stimulate also. It opens
softly, inanely, at English breakfast,
midsummer, country house, and con-
tinues, slightly aching, through to din-
ner, by which time Edward is obsessed
by the mute Matchseller, who simply
stands and negates until one can almost
feel the garden shrivel and the china
shatter. Flora becomes obsessed, too,
but in a direct and predatory way.
Deciding to bath and bed the Match-
seller, she negates the negation, and as
the play ends the choking country-
house comfort closes in, over, and
around the characters in their Pinter-
esque limbo.
The double bill is excellent; ideal
for the small, intimate Sheridan
Theatre. This theatre has an earned
reputation for high production stan-
dards, and the loss to television of
Leslie Dayman, who was a good pro-
ducer as well as the theatre’s best
actor, is hurting them badly. Mr.
John Jarvies’ production, his first in
Adelaide, is on the most amateur level.
There is an almost total misunder-
standing of what the plays are about,
and his new group of actors simply
cannot act.

BOOKS
A Flight of Peacocks
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
A Woman’s Hand. Patrick White,. In-
cluded in Australian Letters, Spring,
1966. $1.25.
WHITE is fundamentally an
ecstatic and visionary, in the
line of Revelations, Blake, Whit-
man, and Lawrence rather than the
cooler Apollonian line of Virgil, Spen-
ser, or Tennyson. Visionaries are often
uncomfortable people to grapple with
and one man’s vision may be another
man’s poison.
With the passage of time White’s
vision seems to be intensifying. There is
a very strong moral element in White’s
vision. His indignation at what is spiritu-
ally deadening is becoming louder and
angrier. Conversely his concern for
those who are pure and innocent is
also increasing. His vision is becoming
starker and there is less and less neutral
experience between the opposite poles
of good and evil.
“The Aunt’s Story” was first pub-
lished in 1948 and contains in its first
half some of the most beautiful and
relaxed writing which White has done.
Already many of his most important
later themes are beginning to be devel-
oped. Aunt Theodora is the prototype
of the spiritually pure, slightly mad
simpletons who figure in later works.
Theodora’s domineering and vicious
mother foreshadows White’s female
dragons who try to burn and eat up
everyone with whom they come in con-
tact. However, she has none of the
calculated and inexorable malice of
Mrs. Jolley in “Riders In The Chariot”
or the barren fury of Mrs. Fazackerley
in the story under review.
Perhaps an indication of White’s
shift in emphasis is his increasing inter-
est in the play and short story. Both
forms favor a simplified, dramatic ex-
position of ideas. He has become more
colloquial, but only in order to lash
and satirise the accumulation of modern
trivia and banalities. In much of
White’s later work one senses the
presence of an invisible audience ready
to laugh at lines such as “She would
really have to see about taking up a
charity, like Meals on Wheels.”
One feels the influence of the dra-
matic form in the opening paragraph of
“A Woman’s Hand.”
“The wind was tearing into the rock-
plants, slashing reflections out of the
leaves of the mirror-bush, torturing
those professional martyrs the native
trees. What must originally have ap-
peared an austere landscape, one long
rush of rock and scrub towards the sea,
was prevented from wearing its natural
expression by the parasite houses cling-
ing to it as obstinately as wax on dis-
eased orange branches. Not that the
houses weren’t nearly all of them, tech-
nically desirable, some of them even
Lovely Homes worth breaking into . . .”
It is a chilling opening, and the grim
leer at the “Lovely Homes” makes it
even colder. We are soon introduced
to Evelyn Fazackerley, who is like the
Lovely Homes which prevent the land-
scape from wearing its natural expres-
sion. Because she feels it is time to
assert herself she tells her husband to
walk more slowly, as that is what re-
tirement is for. As she and her husband
walk along the seafront, they reminisce
about some old friends of theirs from
Suez, who have come down in the
world since those days. Their own
comparative well-being is obviously a
source of satisfaction.
Mrs. Fazackerley is one of White’s
recurring nightmare-women. She is
the inverse of Mrs. Jolley in “Riders
in the Chariot.” Unlike Mrs. Jolley,
she has a certain amount of sterile cul-
tivation and she is childless. However,
the possession of a certain amount of
brains does not prevent her from being
a complete bitch. Her husband is not
much better. He is a tired, rather
pathetic figure who has been looking
forward to rereading “War and
Peace” in his retirement but has never
quite got around to it. His youthful
enthusiasms as a schoolboy poet have
gone by the board.
B UT as Mr. and Mrs. Fazackerley
stroll along the seafront they sud-
denly encounter Clem Dowson, an old
school friend of Harold Fazackerley,
with whom he used to discuss poetry.
There had been a previous encounter
between the parties in Egypt many
years ago, when Mrs. Fazackerley had
had a rather repulsive physical experi-
ence with Clem Dowson. True to form,
she had turned from her door a dis-
reputable-looking Greek friend of Dow-
son’s whom she later found out was a
professor.
But Clem now lives in a small,
eccentric bachelor cottage of wood,
perched precariously on the cliff. Clem
is silent and self-contained, one of
White’s “pure” characters.
Mrs. Fazackerley then arranges a
meeting between Clem and an old
acquaintance of hers called Nesta Pine.
She feels that Clem needs “a woman’s
hand.” However, she is motivated
more by the desire to interfere than
by generosity. She imagines Nesta
visiting Clem.
“She could hear their joint silence.
Yet, why should it not seem natural?
Mushrooms congregate. And spawn
together. Horrid expression . . .
“On an incongruous occasion—but
the Whole business was incongruous—
Evelyn Fazackerley allowed herself a
vision of the elderly Nesta in one of
the more convulsive attitudes of love;
a great jack-knife of sprung flesh, the
saucered rump, breasts heaving and
plopping like a pot of porridge come
to the boil.”
The savagery and physical disgust is
as strong as in Swift. Nesta and Clem
do the dirty on Evelyn and get married
without consulting her. She later re-
ceives an amazing letter from Nesta,
which completely stuns and lambastes
her.
Up until this point the story has
been unrelievedly grim and oppres-
sive, but this letter strikes a note of
extraordinary beauty and tenderness.
The letter goes like this:
“Dear Evelyn,
I don’t know why I am writing
except to say how fond I am of
you. Clem is fond of you, I be-
lieve, but would never admit.
Neither of us says much, which is
the strangest part of it —I have
lived with peacocks all my life!
Most people do not know the
peacock redeems. I began to realise
when we visited that church above
Salonika — or convent, was it? —
so deserted we could not decide —
when the evening was suddenly
filled with silent peacocks — never
before had I seen them in the air
— then settling to roost, their tails
turned to branches of cedar.
Clem, I think, does not believe
in redemption because he has no
need of it. His eyes are perfectly
clear. You couldn’t flaw them in
competition with a crystal. Al-
though he and I are in so many
ways the same, there we differ.
Well, my poor Evelyn, you did
not see the sunset! Let me tell you
it mostly shrieks with the throats
of peacocks — though sometimes
it will open its veins, offering its
blood from love rather than
charity.
NESTA PINE.”
I have quoted the whole of the letter
because of its importance. In the con-
text of the story it is quite shocking
and magical. At a logical level it is
explained by the fact that Nesta has
gone mad and cut her wrists.
In fact, her madness is the madness
of those who are spiritually pure and
understand the meaning of redemption,
which is the positive aspect of White’s
vision.
Sometimes I feel that the objects of
White’s satire are not worth the effort
that he spends on them and that he is
using dynamite on slugs. However,
when one has a total vision of exis-
tence, such as White has, or Blake had,
then everything that exists is important
and is worthy either of praise or blame.

McAuley on Metrics
By J. M. COUPER
A Primer of English Versification. James
McAuley. Sydney University Press.
$1.50.
THIS small book does very succinctly
and effectively what it sets out to
do: it gives, for the student, a
conspectus of English versification. It
does this, moreover, with the firm and
reassuring confidence of the man who
knows what he is about. The reader
is in the hands of a practitioner willing
to say what is done, and to say it with
crisp reliance on his judgment, not be-
cause he is bound to be right but be-
cause he has done it for himself. His
approach is from experience rather than
from study, not that the study is
scamped. He has what King Lear had:
authority—and without exerting it.
The course to be taken is carefully
planned: from stress to the establish-
ment of metrical norms, the necessary
variation of these norms if metre is to
live, the superimposing of speech stresses
concurrently on the metrical accents,
the proper speaking of verse, the artistic
subtleties of words in relation to each
other in the poetic line, a short dis-
mission of other forms of versification
(e.g., syllabic and free verse), a glossary
of terms.
The exposition of all these things,
while thoroughly responsible and
reliable, does not command unvarying
assent, because it is not in the nature
of such a subject to do this. “The
reader,” McAuley once says, “may wish
to dissent from some of these suggested
readings, and he is quite entitled to
do so.” Indeed, it is a reasonable com-
pliment that the interested reader pays.
So we have
/ xx / / xx/x/
Creeps on|the soft|touch of|a ten|der tone]
To say that Crashaw gets a special
effect by two reversed feet may save
the logic or rationale on which Mc-
Auley’s book is built, may, in addition,
save the young student from the muddle
of finding that the rule of “one foot,
one heavy accent” can sometimes be
successfully declined, but there is an-
other logic. McAuley observes, very
well, that the role of metre “is to pro-
vide a fixed scheme, across which the
endless variety of stress fluctuations can
play as one line succeeds another.” In
Crashaw’s line the fixed scheme seems
to be choriambic (/xx/) and it is help-
ful to say so, for the pleasure of the
line is to feel this very tug of the
stress against the fixity.
/ xx / / xx/x/
Creeps on the soft|touch of a ten|der tone|
The special balance, and the special
pace, are at once suggested.
Similarly, his scanning of
x / x / x/ x /
Yet once|more o|ye lau|rels andj
X /
once more,
and of the other line from Lycidas,
calls in question the mere rejection of
the spondee as a “mare’s nest.” One
would gladly grant practically all that
he says —“that the unaccented syllable
i in a foot can bear any degree of stress
up to and including equality, without
changing the metrical character of the
foot.” If he had even said, up to and
beyond equality, one would still allow
the definition to be not only candid
but just. It is the disturbance of
the fixed scheme, it is the smother-
ing of the measure in the drift of
the line, that makes the ambi-
valent delight of poetry. And the scheme
must be there to be disturbed. Is
it adequate, however, to say ta-rum-
ti-tum-ti-tum-ti-tum-ti-tum, and then
hastily write this half page about how
Milton is recalling, and using, the
tones of the classical elegiac hexa-
meter, recalling, let us say, Theocritus,
Idyll 11, and not Shakespeare’s Sigh no
more, ladies, sigh no more, and then
perhaps to draw up a box showing,
both cogently and interestingly, the
consonants, the vowel pitch, the vowel
quantity, the stress, the scansion, all
indubitably exerting on the line as
sweet an influence as the Pleiades?
Does not the shortness of human life
force the invention of some shorthand,
and, at the risk of perversity, might
not this shorthand be
/ \ / xx/x /
Yet once|more O yejlaurelsjand]
\ /
once more|,
although, one must ruefully admit
the basic iambic pentameter is con-
trapuntally suppressed? But only until
Milton’s third line, when it is effort-
lessly reasserted, a delight that he
often indulges in this elegy that turns
the shadow of death into the morning.
In the first half line, to the caesura,
Milton is deliberately picking up the
mantle of young Daphnis with his silver
voice, and singing the Lityerses song
again.
In all of this, one must also gladly
allow that only by assuming such a
firm and lucid logic as McAuley’s can
any fruitful discussion, or even grasp,
of English versification be reached.
It is debate and speculation of the
foregoing kind that the writing con-
tinually raises, insisting as it does on
attention to the line in its place in the
poem.
What McAuley has to say on verse-
speaking is a piodel of good sense and
good taste. His best chapter is the
one on Articulation and what he calls.
Word-Build. It gives him most free-
dom to demonstrate the enormous
variety of effects possible to poetry. One
is induced to see, briefly, that in these
matters of weight and pace and plac-
ing every line brings its own spirit to the
laws, and that McAuley is the man
to point it out, exactly, unfussily, and
refreshingly, in the manner of this
apercu on enjambment:
“The expressive effect may be en-
hanced by not hurrying on . . . Then,
sometimes, in that silence, while he
hung listening . . .”
But this had to be a brief book. The
attention is easily teased by such nice-
ness of distinction, and, as the author
himself says, “enough is enough.”
I write this sonnet the size of a tomb..
Look away. I write this sonnet the size of a tomb.
I lay on the bed of needles, six floors high,
And, wheeled out of time, looked into my window’s room,
What the visiting sharp alternative put by,
The plotted miles down there, beamed wood and stone,
Grind-stone, headstone, bungalow yards of bone.
Look away. I write my sonnet the shape of these
Little sepulchres of our offices in life,
The survivals we build on that bring us to our knees,
Burial before the needle or the knife;
And nothing should surprise us in that wheeled state
When we look through windows on the rooms we vacate:
Nothing: nothing but the bed, sharp bed, set high,
The alternative that the tombs, down there, put by.

Art in a Hothouse
By ELWYN LYNN
Private View: The Lively World of
British Art. Bryan Robertson and John
Russell with photographs by Lord
Snowdon. 267 black and white, 101
color reproductions. Nelson. $18.40.
THE joint authors of this highly
readable, heavy, and handsome
illustrated guide through recent
and contemporaneous contemporary
British art announce that it’s a
view from inside the Art Establishment
in which they, and no doubt
Lord Snowdon, too, are en-
trenched. Russell is art critic for
“The Sunday Times,” and Bryan Rob-
ertson director of the taste-making-
and-challenging Whitechapel Gallery.
(He collected Australian art in 1960
for the important survey at his gallery
in 1961.) .
The book is no eulogy; it’s full of
Establishment self-criticism, for, despite
the fact that the authors believe Lon-
don to be one of the three great cities
of art, all is not as bright and clear
as Snowdon’s excellent color shots.
There is, they say, much lamentable
amateurishness, a wariness of the
scholar and expert in the organisation
of art, over which recent painting and
sculpture have somehow triumphed.
Russell sees the amateur-trustees, whom
he finds discreet, hard-working, and
fair, “both tardy and ambivalent in
their attitude to living art,” but Robert-
son says they are not renowned for im-
partiality, seek social advancement,
and, as in America, generally replace
the dedicated and knowledgeable direc-
tor with the mediocre.
This blowing the gaff publicly on
what is usually said (in Australia, too)
privately sets the tone of much of the
book, but is their enthusiasm for
Britain’s art, if not its organisation,
justified?
Lawrence Alloway, who has just re-
signed as curator of New York’s Gug-
genheim and who is the finest ideas
man produced recently from London —
the authors mention him once —said
(19/6/66) in the “New York Times,”
of London, called by Robertson the
most civilised city and by “Time” the
swingingest city: “It still has a curfew
of 11. England has made a contribu-
tion to fashion, both male and female,
and there you are. The new English
sculpture? That’s exactly like the
fashions. The ‘Queen’ magazine, mini-
skirts and polychrome sculpture—a
package for the young moderns. As
pop culture, I adore it, but U.S. art
is streets ahead.”
Ignore Caro’s girder-metal sheet poly-
chrome sculpture, leave aside the dis-
quiet in a Bacon, a Souza (not in the
book), a Nolan, or a' Moore (whose
concern with psychic warfare is over-
stressed by Russell), and the rest looks
complacent. U.S. artists find English
art short on urgency, abrasiveness, and
an obsessive desire to push to the limit.
There is too much contentment with
amateurishness, whimsy, and detach-
ment. English art can look so civilised
as to be effete, representing an abne-
gation of the feelings. There’s more
caprice in a top-popster like Hockney
than satire, and the celebrated Cohen
brothers look like playboys of the mild
art-nouveau arabesque.
If the art is not the best, the authors
keep art issues before us. What makes
London a centre is the aesthetic-mone-
tary aura of the salesrooms of Sothe-
by’s and Christie’s and of the deals of
internationally orientated galleries like
Gimpel Fils, Marlborough, and Kas-
min. These, along with the promotional
prowess of redoubtable figures like Mrs.
Lilian Somerville of the Arts Council,
are deftly delineated, but how power
in the art world of scholars, dealers,
schools, and collectors really works
goes untreated.
It’s a most enjoyable book, mingling
near-gossip with lively and often
definite notes on the artists; text and
illustration take turns in co-operative
stimulation, though some of the black-
and-white plates are too artily granu-
lated and pale I’ve met Russell,
Robertson, Melville, and Bridget Riley,
but can only recognise the last two
from the photographs. If Miss Riley
poses too tastefully between optical
paintings, Roger Hilton is shown too
tastelessly with whisky bottle to lips,
even if he is a defiantly happy con-
sumer.
Maybe it’s a symbol, because, in the
final analysis, this is a consumer’s book
that momentarily records what gives.
Waking is easy
Waking is easy. Sleeping
brings the savage beast
which comes creeping
in unfamiliar form
to satisfaction at your breast.
Those are priests
who with blue eyes
discover dangerous beasts
but keep them in green gardens
of their mercies.
These are dark devils
bulking in the black,
whose range of airy evils
knows no definition
of a line. Thus wak-
ing, and not sleeping,
is wasteful of tears,
for wakeful weeping
can fashion scrutable forms
for infinite fears.

A Stranger With a Bag. Sylvia Townsend
Warner. Chatto. $2.65.
Ary- i c *7q ci* j
1 the age of 73, Sylvia 1 ownsend
... 6 . .’ . ... .
Warner is still writing delicately
moulded short stones, a lut
two have appeared over the past few
in New \ orker.
Miss Warner used to write about the
devil, now, forty years after her fam-
ous Lolly Willowes she concentrates
? n th <; devil s disciples, usually catch-
mg them or their victims in flight
(escape is one of her main preoccupa-
tions) and dissecting them neatly with
her wit. Today, when she calls up the
symbols and omens of darkness, it is
always discreetly managed: they appear
only as the manifestations of a well-
informed sceptical mind.
All the stories in “A Stranger With
a Bag” have the quality of dream. The
title story immediately establishes a
delicate balance between the ambiguous,
trance-like atmosphere of impending
evil and the irrepressible absurdity of
, r ’ A
a murderer with a cold in the nose and
a carving . knife in his hand . A down-
trodden drudge of a commercial travel-
ler in beeswax is compe lled to leave his
train at a station where it never usually
st and is drawn to an apparently
deserted house fenced in b ilexes>
laurel and iron spikes that he has
often ed but never seen be f o re. H is
mome ntary escape from routine self
imo a scene of farcical tragedy opens
a rev elatory exploration of the sub-
conscious landscapes of his own mind,
But he turns his back on the truth
and retreats? « wading through dark _
ness as through knee-high water,”
allowing nothing to stick but the mud
still caking his shoes,
Horror takes a different form in
“Fenella,” with the sensitive English
schoolgirl’s dawning realisation that
the macabre “doll” in frilled blue satin
and popping glass eyes in the deserted
Italian church is really the embalmed
body of the local village “child-
saint.” The 13-year-old also retreats
to the haven of her monstrously un-
feeling mother in a luxurious hotel,
tactfully leaving the reader to draw the
discreetly hinted conclusion—the dead
body on show in the transparent coffin
could be the shrinking “Fenella” her-
self, entombed in the cold vault of her
parent’s insensitivity.
Child-eating mothers seem a particu-
lar obsession of Sylvia Townsend War-
ner. There are several permutations
in these stories. “Their Quiet Lives”
is the tragi-comedy of two adult sib-
lings who finally break through the
vampire net after years of useless ser-
vice and sacrifice, one with a secret
marriage, the other with a flight into
a religious order, only to have the ges-
tures flung back in their faces. The
tyrant dies a sudden but normal death
without even realising that they had
escaped her.
“An Act of Reparation” has some-
thing of the sting of Moravia’s well-
known short story “Don’t Delve 100
Deeply,” but with an added twist to
drive the point further home. The
overweening vanity of the exacting
male is the same, but the circumstances
are somewhat altered, so that we are
made to see how much our own con-
ceit colors for us the actions of others.
Swelled with pride, the husband is
blissfully unaware that the favorite
dinner his ex-wife cooks for him in
his new wife’s kitchen is not a lure to
get him gack but a thanksgiving offer-
ing for her own release.
STILL worse are the twin-headed
monsters —husband and mother —
oppressing the wife between them as in
“Healthy Landscape with Dormouse,”
using the awful paraphernalia of a gro-
tesque picnic complete with wet-lettuce
sandwiches and stale bought cakes
smelling of coughdrops from an ancient
wicker hamper as instruments of tor-
ture. And there is the claustrophobic
nursery throwback of “Johnnie
Brewer,” who returns to visit his
grandmother and great-aunt Miranda
in their English country house with
daisies on the lawn and the silver tea-
pot on the damask cloth. The two old
ladies call a momentary truce in their
systematic Virginia-Woolfing of each
other’s self-respect to take a toothsome
bite out of “little” Johnnie instead.
About everything in this volume there
lingers the immediately indentifiable
aura of the English, which may be one
of the reasons why Miss Warner has
always been successful in the States. But
for every meadow starred with king-
cups, every cuckoo in the woods, every
fine china plate of thin bread and
butter, and every village store with
bull’s-eyes in the window, there is a
toad in the shrubbery, an owl hooting
in the alders, rats in the cellars, and
a dead snake on the path.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
No more Drought
JUST as the drought came on in fits and starts and was
upon us before we really realised, so it has been on the
way out. It has been a series of hesitant steps put,
followed with monotonous regularity by staggers back in.
As always it is difficult to draw a satisfactory line, but it
now looks as if we are across it, and it is time to proclaim
finally that the drought is broken. Right back at Christmas-
time there was good rain over many drought-affected
areas, but that turned out to be the proverbial flash in the
pan and was quickly lost. The same happened in April
and May and announcements that the drought was broken
proved premature. The winter and early spring in eastern
Australia were unusually dry again. But August and Sep-
tember have washed fears away with persistent, well-above-
average rains over almost all drought areas. Soaking falls
of 5 to 10 inches have accumulated at all but a few spots
on the coast. It will now take a lot of dry for us to slip
back into trouble again.
The result is that we go toward summer with better-
than-average prospects for the rural sector. An all-time
record wheat acreage is sown —over 20m. acres —larger than
the 1930 total of 18.2 m. which has stood for so long. Not
that anyone expects yield per acre to reach the levels of
the bumper 1964 harvest, when an average of 20 bushels
an acre was reaped. In all the four big wheat States
the early dry delayed sowing or retarded early growth. This
suggested a harvest of 335 m. bushels, the official estimate.
But the recent rains have given that a conservative appear-
ance and there is no reason to doubt that the final crop
will be up around the record 370 m.-bushel level.
Prices are holding up well. The possibility of a new
“leap forward” in China will gladden the hearts of wheat-
growers, since this is likely to postpone indefinitely the
time when that country will be self-sufficient in food-grains.
As long as the thought of Mao continues to wreak economic
havoc, China will be a secure market.
For sheepmen, the problem is no longer feed or water,
but stock. Queensland and N.S.W. could use 25 percent
more animals than are available, and prices have been
going up. Higher meat prices may cause housewives to
cut back a little on their purchases, so marginally reducing
slaughterings of potential breeders. But restocking can hardly
proceed at more than about 3 percent a year, so the drought
loss will take several years to recoup. And the shortage
of sheep remains a chronic problem in the west. Despite
the fact that the wool clip is bound to remain small, overall
earnings look like staying strong. The main danger is the
longer-term one that high wool prices will accentuate the
competition from synthetics through encouraging more sub-
stitution for wool and further research on improving
synthetics’ quality.
For beef men, the situation looks promising on both the
local and overseas fronts, with high local prices for quality
meat likely to continue as drought-induced shortages con-
tinue for some time. And for the big exporting graziers,
particularly in Queensland, the U.S. market seems likely to
provide adequate returns for manufacturing grades, not only
because of U.S. population growth but also because of the
demands of the armed services (although there has been
little evidence so far, apart from some U.S. Navy purchases,
MEN AND MATTERS
THE return of 46-year-old Eric
Clementson to the corridors of
power in the Project Development
Wynyard Holdings group after two
years in exile is now complete.
And all his adversaries have gone,
particularly the former chairman of
PDC and Wynyard, Mr. Colin Gray,
senior partner in the Sydney account-
ing firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell,
who has been replaced at PDC by Mr.
Bruce Smith, and at Wynyard by Mr.
Cyril Stevens, another Peat Marwick
man.
One of a family of six (he is now
the father of five), and brought up on
a farm in New Zealand, Clementson’s
rudimentary education ended with his
joining the railways as a porter, then
the NZ Army as a private. The war
took him to Italy and Japan—and left
him a private. After it, he became a
carpenter.
A short spell working for an N.Z.
•builder convinced him there were not
enough opportunities in N.Z. and he
came to Australia in 1948, starting off
his own small building operation, “E. S.
Clementson, Builders,” with a couple
of houses at Castlecrag and some wool
sheds in the country. This country
boy got his first big break when he
won the contract to build the $1 mil-
lion Glen Innes hospital. And then he
got into the big stuff. In between he
found time to win
licences for Syd-
ney’s first drive-in
picture theatres,
which he built and
sold, and for going
back to his farming
roots by runing a
highly efficient
dairy farm at Liver-
pool (which he is
now subdividing
into building blocks,
as if to mirror the
move he made from farming to build-
ing).
In any event, he has a really big
farm to look after now to satisfy all
these rural drives—the 2 million acres
of leasehold in the Kimberleys (with
a meatworks at Broome) that he
bought for himself in 1963 and sold to
PDC just before the board blow-up
two years ago.
PERKIN-ELMER CORPORATION
of Connecticut did the polite and
inspired thing in appointing a
local man as managing director of its
first venture in Australia. The first
product this U.S. scientific instrument
maker will manufacture (mainly for
export) at its new factory at Glen
Waverley, expected to be in operation
in mid-1967, is an instrument developed

by CSIRO for use in detecting minute
leaks in laboratory and industrial
equipment. The up-and-coming Aus-
tralian executive chosen is Dr. J. G.
Campbell, whom they grabbed after
he’d been only a year or so director
of the Wool Testing Authority.
Born 39 years ago and schooled
(Geelong Grammar) in the purple and
still there (in Lansell Road, Toorak),
Dr. Campbell mapped out an academic
career for himself after getting high
honors in science at Melbourne Univer-
sity, where three years as senior demon-
strator in physics gave him an appetite
for industry. In 1956 he left to start
at the bottom *— at APM, spending
the next nine years in the paper mills,
ultimately as senior research physicist
at Fairfield.


that the U.S. forces are buying any of their Vietnam meat
requirements in Australia).
The short-term rural prospect, therefore, is quite bright,
gut, with the drought over, attention must shift to the
longer-term problems of raising efficiency and keeping down
costs.
The Need to Think Ahead
IN November, 1964, the then Prime Minister Menzies
announced the celebrated three years’ defence program
providing for the military build-up which is now in
progress. From $594m. in that financial year, expenditure
was to rise to s74om. in 1965/6 to sB44m. this year, ending
up at sBsBm. next year. Quite properly the Government
has not stuck rigidly to this schedule and a number of new
purchases of equipment have been made and a small expan-
sion made in the Army’s manpower target. The larger
Vietnam commitment has also boosted costs. But so far
there has been no attempt at the official level to reconcile
the new figure announced in the Budget with the figure in
the plan.
Such plans are an admirable innovation, since annual
Budgets provide too short a time span in which to carry
through major projects. But if they are to be useful, the
reasons for departures from plan must be spelled out and
revised versions put out from time to time. If the defence
report expected in Parliament this week does not clear up
these points, then the Government should ensure that this
is done promptly.
There has been a lot of complaining about the Govern-
ment’s attitude toward local defence industry. Some of this
can be dismissed as self-interested protectionist thinking
which would lead Australia toward a type of siege economy
if taken seriously. There is a lot of equipment which cannot
be produced here except at immensely greater cost than
overseas. On the other hand, an attempt by the services
to plan further ahead would indicate better to local industry
the opportunities or big, continuing sales.
All in the Mind
WHILE the ANZ Bank is busy convincing businessmen
that the current slowdown in business is because of
problems that are “all in the mind,” the fact remains
that it will need cash as well as psychology to kick the
economy along.
In this week’s quarterly survey, the bank recognises that
the general slackness in the economy is not only persisting
but “there have been strong indications of these trends
becoming more intensified in recent weeks.” But it claims
that “when all the relevent factors are taken into account,
there seems little justification for the present lack of buoy-
ancy in the general business outlook and the conclusion must
be drawn that the problem is largely psychological. In
these circumstances, it would be most opportune for positive
steps to be taken to restore confidence and stimulate a
return to general business activity.
“The necessary stimulatory action, against the background
of the large-scale, long-term developments that are taking
place, would therefore need to be only marginal. Such
marginal action at official levels could well pay substantial
dividends without running any risk of causing inflationary
pressures because of the unused capacity at present available
ln the Australian economy.”
But the Government is scooping off the cash that could
have helped things along and is spending more and more
of it overseas. And it would take a brave man to adopt
a buoyant “things are great” attitude while the uncertain
international trading outlook adds a few more furrows to
businessmen’s frowns these days. It seems quite wise for
businessmen to run for cover when they see the left hand
of Government (in the States) undoing all the allegedly
stimulatory” work done by the right hand (in Canberra),
•hi these circumstances, the greatest bit of confidence the
business community could get would be if the economic
authorities showed they knew what they were doing.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The Federal Government is
seeking sl2om. in its second cash loan for 1966-67,
with steady long-term interest rate of percent . . .
For the second successive month, Australia had a trade
deficit in September, largely because of the arrival of
the Navy’s newest guided-missile destroyer.
Following the lead of other States, the Western
Australian Government in its Budget has raised stamp
duties and will also bring down legislation to abolish
quarterly adjustments to the State basic wage . . .
The N.S.W. and Victorian Premiers are to discuss
their States’ financial difficulties with the Prime Minister,
pressing for a more generous share of tax revenue under
the Commonwealth-States tax reimbursement formula.
For the markets : Equities continued to be treated
with circumspection, and the Australian share markets’
performance over the week was unimpressive. But there
is plenty of money around for debenture issues; BHP’s
$4O million offering was heavily oversubscribed and had
to be rationed. IBM’s is in keen demand.
Dealings in the £stg.6om. ICI loan stock dominated
the London stock market, but other debentures moved
higher in sympathy . . . Anticipating lower corporate
earnings and displaying concern over confusing news
from Vietnam, Wall Street slipped to its lowest level in
nearly three years.
For companies: Pioneer Concrete Services
starred in the news, making an early profit announce-
ment (up from $1.57m. to $1.73m.), because of last
week’s bid for Rowlands Quarries and then an offer
for F. W. Williams, whose directors approved of it as
a rescue operation from Martin Corporation (which
claims $46 percent acceptance to its bid). The Pioneer
cash and shares bid gives Williams’ shareholders the
option of taking ACI shares instead of the cash element
of the offer ... To consolidate its position in N.S.W.,
Blue Metal Industries is negotiating to bid for Emu and
Prospect Gravel and Road Metal Co. Earlier in the
week, BMI had reported steady trading for 1965-66,
despite losses on the now-completed Mascot runway
job, on which they have made “substantial claims”
against the Commonwealth . . . Attracting more market
attention because of the rush of takeovers in the indus-
try, Consolidated Quarries reported steady trading,
thanks to a better second half.
The Myer Emporium opened its slBm. regional shop-
ping centre at Preston, and reported a record profit
for the group of sllm. from sales of $273m. . . .
In the West, David Jones W.A. (formerly Foy and Gib-
son’s) lifted profit 7 percent to $231,000 . . . Clothing
specialist John Sackville and Sons made only $252,000
net, compared with $364,000 in 1965 . . . Federal
Woollen Mills, of Geelong, lost less, but Castlemaine
Woollen Co., which went into receivership the previous
week, announced that losses were greater than the year
before.
In food, White Crow’s profit edged slightly higher,
while Tancred Bros., the meat processor, is issuing
free scrip (one-for-five) in lieu of dividend . . . and T. A.
Field lifted profit 17 percent to $650,000 . . . Another
record result came from essence maker Keith Harris,
which held dividend at 20 percent even though the
previous year’s 20 percent included a special bonus
payment of 2| percent . . . Maltster Barrett Burston
lifted interim dividend from 6J to 6J percent . . .
Rumors flew about British Tobacco’s possible entry to
brewing with a plant in Victoria to invade Carlton and
United’s territory.
GUD Holdings (filters and gaskets) lifted dividend
from percent to 26 percent., and from earnings
up to 56.3 percent is making another one-for-four
bonus a year after the last one . . . Eight months sales
and profits have been good enough for Email to lift


MERCANTILE CREDITS LIMITED
THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
30th SEPTEMBER, 1966
Chairwnan's Address
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I have pleasure in welcoming you
to this, the Company’s 31st Annual
General Meeting. It is the first at
which I have had the privilege of
being Chairman following the retire-
ment of Mr. D. C. Cameron on Ist
July this year, and who was Chairman
of this Company for the past 30 years.
Mr. Cameron has decided not to seek
re-election to the Board at this Meet-
ing as he might otherwise have done
and so he is with us today for the last
time as a Director of the Company. I
want, therefore, to express my personal
appreciation and that of all our Direc-
tors to Mr. Cameron for the great con-
tribution he has made to the Company.
Under his leadership the Company
has grown from a small enterprise to
become one of the leaders among the
finance companies in Australia. I know
you will join me in ,wishing him many
years of good health and enjoyment of
his retirement.
In recognition of his services the
Board would like to grant to Mr.
Cameron a retiring allowance of
$10,000; under the Provisions of the
Companies Act this will need share-
holders’ approval and a motion to this
effect will be put before you shortly.
Referring to the Accounts, the
Annual Accounts and Directors’ and
Auditors’ Reports have been sent to all
.shareholders and I expect you have
read them with interest.
The past year has been an impor-
tant one in the Company’s history;
new records have been achieved. The
net trading profit for the year of the
Mercantile Credits Group of Com-
panies amounted to $1,476,299, after
providing $503,715 for taxation.
After providjng for the preference
dividend this represents an earning rate
of 20.09% on the increased ordinary
paid up capital compared with 18.91%
for the previous year.
During the year your Company made
successful offers for Bonwood Pty. Ltd.
and Richmond Export Pty. Ltd., two
Associated Companies. Through these
acquisitions we gained the benefit of
the use of certain retention monies for
a number of years and in addition
made a direct capital profit. After
these purposes were achieved we were
successful in disposing of the structures
of these two companies, which were no
longer trading nor were they contribut-
ing further to the Group profits other
than by the use of their funds which
would be replaced in the event of such
a sale. These two subsidiaries were in-
cluded as guarantors in respect of the
parent Company under the debenture
stock trust deed and before they could
be sold it was necessary to obtain the
approval of the debenture stock holders
to give the Trustee discretion if re-
quired to release any subsidiary from
such obligations under the Deed. The
two subsidiaries were then sold and
provided a net capital profit of
$182,382.
TRADING OPERATIONS
Looking back over the past year your
Company and its finance subsidiaries
were able to do a record volume of
business in spite of intense competition
and in fact in the latter part of the
year we were unable to accept still
further business which was offered to
us because of the heavy demand on our
available funds. Your Company con-
tinues to enjoy the utmost confidence
of its depositors and debenture holders
as is illustrated by the fact that of a
record maturity during July, 1966,
holders re-invested a large proportion
of maturing funds with the Company
for further periods. Nevertheless we
require to increase the overall borrow-
ings to achieve a satisfactory ratio to
consolidated shareholders’ funds, which
latter since June, 1964, have increased
by $5,237,338.
During the year under review two de-
benture issues were opened for public
subscription. Both were oversubscribed.
Total public borrowings including these
Debenture Issues at the year’s end
amounted to $52,006,864.
Business transactions are well-spread
over a number of classes of business
and as a result your Company retains
flexibility in its operations and is able
to meet competition. As the subject of
bad debts has been in the news recently
I want to tell you that our debtor
accounts are under continual scrutiny
in the preparation of our final accounts
for each half year. After consultation
with our Auditors every known bad
debt has been written off and every
doubtful debt adequately provided for.
Because of the spread of our business
and the high standard of acceptance
the incidence of bad debts in your
Company has always been small.
SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
I can report that all subsidiary com-
panies traded profitably for the year.
One of these, a small Adelaide Finance
Company, named Invicta Finance Co.
Limited, purchased by us in conjunction
with the establishment of a Branch in
that city, will be liquidated during the
current year. Our industrial activity
in Perth, the W.A. Netting and Wire
Co. Limited, continues to be profit-
able.
To enable this Company to expand
and develop it will be necessary to
increase its capacity and this is having
the attention of your Directors.
DIVERSIFICATION
As mentioned by the Chairman at
the meeting last year, your Directors
are aware of the benefits to be gained
in association in ancillary financial
activities and your Company recently
acquired an interest in Martin Cor-
poration Limited, a specialised invest-
ment house, in association with other
interested parties, including Baring Co.
Ltd., a leading London merchant bank,
and Cater Rider and Co., an old-
established London discount house.
Through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Insured Housing Loans Limited, it
plans to provide high-class securities
to the investing public in conjunction
with an additional source of existing
finance at favourable rates.
OFFICE PREMISES
The Company’s continued progress
and expansion has made it necessary
to seek new offices and accommodation
in several centres. During the latter
part of 1965 our Melbourne Branch
moved to modern premises at the
National Mutual Centre in Collins
Street. In Canberra during the current
year we purchased a three-storey build-
ing at 33 London Circuit and as men-
tioned in the Directors’ Report we are
planning to move the Head Office and

AUSTRALIAN FINANCE CONFERENCE
A number of Finance Companies are
deriving increasing benefits by the pool-
ing of knowledge, information and ex-
perience through membership of the
Australian Finance Conference. Your
Company is actively engaged in this
Conference and our Managing Direc-
tor, Mr. M. D. Thompson, has this
year been elected to the position of
Deputy Federal Chairman of Confer-
ence. This Association is carrying out
research and developing statistics and
other economical information which is
proving of value to the rapidly develop-
ing finance industry, and this informa-
tion is made available not only to
member companies but to authorities
responsible for administering legislation
governing industry activities and for
charting the progress of Australia’s
economy. Your Company, together with
other Conference members, appreciates
the work of the Commonwealth
Bureau of Census and Statistics which
is widening the range of official
statistics of the industry.
Another valuable activity of Confer-
ence is in the field of public education
in the wise use of instalment credit and
it will continue this work for the bene-
fit not only of the industry but also
consumers. It is important that in-
vestors and borrowers be protected by
legislation but at the same time it is
the responsibility of legislators to en-
sure that the laws are practical and
fairly balanced between both those who
use and those who grant credit.
EXECUTIVES AND STAFF
Your Company has been the leader
in thought and action in the finance
industry and your Directors recognise
the need for study both in Australia
and overseas of changes which may be
of benefit to the Company. With this
in view, the General Manager, Mr. W.
M. Thompson, and Mr. J. R. Ashley,
Assistant to the Managing Director,
are at present overseas studying leasing
methods and finance activities; the
knowledge they gain should prove to
be of value in the future.
I know that you will wish me to
express to our executives and staff in
all offices appreciation of their loyalty
and zeal in the achievement of the
year’s results which are before you and
I want to congratulate them on their
part on this excellent achievement.
I now move that the Accounts and
Reports as tabled be received and when
this has been seconded they will be
open for discussion.

PETER SAMUEL'S CANBERRA
Indonesia's Economic Mess
CANBERRA has its various fashions
in conversation. In diplomatic
circles it just isn’t done to discuss
the biggest topics. So at the diplomatic
cocktail parties late last week LBJ’s
coming visit did not even rate a men-
tion. All the talk was about Dr. Roe-
slan Abdulgani, the leading Indonesian
Government man who was unexpectedly
in Canberra for three days last week.
It was an extraordinary visit from its
lack of fuss, as much as anything. He
simply decided on his way home to
Djakarta from New York that he would
like to spend a few days in Australia.
So he called in—an unusually sensible
procedure, but one that by its break
with formality and convention had the
Diplomatic Corps chattering.
At first the flustered embassy des-
cribed the visit as “private,” but the
number four or number five man in
Government simply does not make
private visits to anywhere. So it became
an “unofficial” visit. In response to
requests, a Press conference was
arranged and it turned out to be a
positively sparkling performance. Dr.
Abdulgani, who is chairman of the
National Planning Council and is des-
cribed as a special adviser to the Presi-
dent and General Suharto, exudes a
new Indonesian spirit.
There was no nonsense about the
past. The economy had collapsed into
shambles as a result of Confrontation.
And he had no excuses for the past
policy of hostility toward Malaysia.
He was soon talking about the
economy, which was the key to general
progress toward a measure of stability.
To contain inflation, production must
be raised toward consumption. This
is a matter of getting .transport and
factories going again, because these have
been allowed to run right down. “We
need spare parts most of all. Do not
give us rice as yet. We cannot trans-
port it.” The Army is being directed
to devote an increasing proportion of
its energies toward, civic work—build-
ing bridges and roads and growing its
own food so it was not too great a drain
on the nation.
In international relations, the im-
mediate problem of debt repayment has
been put off for the time being with
the successful negotiation of a three-year
moratorium. Private investment is to be
encouraged again, and a new foreign
investment law is to be introduced with-
in the next few weeks.
A journalist asked him about the
future of the existing Australian invest-
ment in Indonesia: The Aspro factory
in Djakarta. This produced a lot of
jovial banter about whether it was
Indonesia which had the headaches or
foreign countries dealing with Indon-
esia. Promising to enquire about
arrangements for a settlement with
Nicholas. He said that foreign con-
fidence was the key to a resumption of
investment and the extension of credit,
“This is something we cannot force.
We have nothing to hide. We have our
strengths and our weaknesses. Our
weaknesses are there for all to see and
we do not attempt to disguise them any
more. And we have policies for tackling
them. Certainly, everything seems to
point to the creation of a better climate
for investment in Indonesia.
Abdulgani was insistent that the era-
of extreme Left policies was com-
pletely closed. The Communists, he
said, had promoted class struggle in
Indonesia, but this was completely arti-
ficial and they were most unpopular
among the mass of the people. Socialism
remains one of the five principles to
which Indonesia subscribes, but this
does not imply nationalisation
“socialism is simply social justice.”

When North Meets South
By CROESUS
BEARDING Dr. Rex Patterson in
a suburban den on his one-day
visit to Melbourne last week, I
confirmed an impression that though
he’s looking at Australia upside down
compared with most of us, one must
not berate him because of it. Anyway,
being born in Bundaberg, he has a good
excuse for taking a posture which de-
velopment pundits in Victoria would
find most uncomfortable.
Understandably, as a man from the
north, Patterson is greatly concerned at
the bias in national policies which up
to this have barely nodded at the aiea’s
full economical development potential.
He has made us all aware of that dur-
ing his as yet brief encounter with
politics as MHR for Dawson (Qld.),
but many people will be unfamiliar with
the hard logic and reasoning—the
man’s commanding grasp of facts —
behind the concern for the north which
nagged him so long as director of the
Northern Division of the Department
of National Development.
The most interesting of the arguments
he put up to me is that on balance of
payments considerations, Queensland is
a better proposition by far than the
southern States for the deployment of
capital. In support of this claim he
adduces figures showing that over the
past decade Queensland earned a sur-
plus of $3150m. in its overseas pay-
ments, while together N.S.W. and Vic-
toria incurred a deficit of ssloom. (as
capital items would figure in such a
calculation and would be extremely
difficult to align on a State basis, his
figures would be open to challenge, I
would say.) He goes on to argue that if
Queensland did not earn its big off-
setting surpluses, the southern States
would have to reduce their imports
drastically, retard their rate of econ-
omic growth, and cut back employ-
ment.
JQR. PATTERSON elaborates on the
north’s capital starvation. Apart
from capital for the Ord Scheme, uot a
cent of Federal Government assistance
has been given to water conservation
there over the past 16 years (I pre-
sume this excludes loan money via
Federal Government channels). This
is a parlous state of affairs on his show-
ing that three-quarters of Australia’s
surface water is located in northern
regions. How much of this is har-
nessable? Whatever the technical pos-
sibilities, it seems true that, as he says,
“Today we have the absurd paradox
of millions of acre feet of water flow-
ing to the sea through proven and
established areas devastated by
drought—and these droughts are cost-
ing the nation colossal sums.”
Whatever the engineers may think of
the possibilities, economics-wise Patter-
son believes (and strongly) that we
should be looking at northern basins
such as the Fitzroy, Burdekin, Burnett,
Pioneer, and Gulf rivers in Queensland,
the Daly and Adelaide rivers in N.T.
and the Ord and Fitzroy in W.A. in
terms of future food bowls to serve
Asia, and as areas which could support
heavy concentrations of people.
Nonetheless it seems pretty obvious
that even on established economic feasa-
bilities in particular basins, national
development requires a far greater em-
phasis on water conservation. In Patter-
son’s view this should be given “almost
the same” priority as defence.
Patterson said he was well aware that
water is not the only national resource
claiming increas-
ing attention for
deployment of the
limited supplies of
capital available
at the present
time. The list is
short perhaps, but
spectacular, with
iron ore, crude
oil, and natural
gas, to name a few
screaming out for
capital. But as
has been shown
Rex Patterson
by the drought in the past few years,
water is not such a long-term matter as
many people used to think. Indeed, go-
ing on stirrings in the water provision
profession itself, Dr. Patterson is not a
lone voice in submitting that to regard
it as a long-term problem will be at our
our economic peril. I noticed at a re-
ception for Patterson at the ALP Party
rooms in Henty that Sir Ronald East,
former chairman of the State Rivers
and Water Supply Commission, was
swopping notes with him, and recently
in Canberra a galaxy of international
water experts gave notice at an ECAFE
water resources conference that they
meant business in the field.
The Australian delegate to this in-
ternational conference, Mr. R. A. Hors-
fall, not only thought that a national
water resources plan for Australia was
desirable—perhaps in Patterson’s terms?
—but that it had good prospects of
being implemented. He seemed to be
thinking of the northern basins even
more than his own in the south (he is
deputy chairman of Victoria’s State
Rivers and Water Supply Commission)
which, have had bountiful sums lavished
on them under a ten-year development
plan now in its fifth year. He thought
that though water development was
primarily a State responsibility, the
Snowy Mountains Authority and River
Murray Commission augured well for
future successes.
In looking forward to inter-State co-
operation being extended to even more
significant projects with the objective
of increasing rural exports and food
surpluses for distribution in the ECAFE
region, it would seem that the most
useful route of co-operation would lie
in the capital allocation rather than
the technical field. As Dr. Patterson
sees it, the south is being succored with
capital for water conservation while
the north is being starved.
If Victoria’s water authorities are go-
ing to concede this, as Horsfall seemed
to be suggesting, then, subject to poli-
tical acceptability, there may be some
hope for the northerners. Without poli-
tical concurrence, of course, nothing can
be expected to happen. In any case the
needs for more water conservation m
northern N.S.W. are so pressing, as
evidenced in the past year or more, that
future efforts at inter-State co-operation
at the expense of capital provision at
least for that State could run into
difficulties.

ONE OF THE WORLD’S 5 GREAT WHISKIES
J. C. HORSFALL'S MELBOURNE
Skeletons in CBA's cupboard
MANY banks have been started in
Victoria over the years. Few
have survived. Amalgamations
have swallowed up a lot and many
more have simply been put out of
business. The two sole Victorian regist-
ered survivors among the private trad-
ing banks are the National Bank of
Australasia, which has been going strong
since 1859, and the Commercial Bank
of Australia (not always so strong)
since 1866.
It must be very satisfying for the
Commercial Bank of Australia to have
started life on the same spot in Collins
Street as it lives on today after a hun-
dred years, but the history the bank
gives of these years in its annual report
sent out last week is more notable
for what it leaves out than for what it
contains. It gives the impression that
the bank has grown to its present emi-
nent place in the Australian banking
structure it is the fifth biggest pri-
vate trading bank on a sort of up-
ward straight line progression with
barely a dint in it. A more faithful
account would have at least said some-
thing about the really rough period the
bank went through after the land
building boom collapsed in the eighteen
nineties.
The history dismisses this awkward
period with one mere phrase, referring
to “the financial troubles of the early
eighteen nineties.” One might have ex-
pected the bank to feel secure enough
now to fill in the picture of this trying
era, which tested its powers of survival
to the limit. Even if, apparently, longe-
vity is what you make it, any bank
which could safely outlive such an
experience should feel confident of last-
ing for ever.
After a recital of achievements from
1866, the history is interrupted abruptly
at 1892 on the eve of the CBA’s greatest
agonies. It is only picked up again in
1906, when they are over and the bank
is expanding into Tasmania (it had
acquired other banks in S.A. and
N.S.W. before 1892). All certainly must
have looked fine in 1892 when the pre-
sent head office in Collins Street was
erected (there have been a few alter-
ations since), when deposits were, for
those days, a substantial $24 million
and there were more than a hundred
branches _(today there are 531 branches
and 339 agencies).
Another yawning gap in the bank’s
present history is the failure to mention
its entry, via General Credits, into the
hire purchase business in Australia by
the purchase of a controlling interest
(now 42 percent) in that company in
1956 and to give an account of its
experiences in that field. Strangely
enough, elsewhere in its latest report
the bank relates how it got into HP in
New Zealand last year.
One might be tempted to think that,
considering the evil days General Credits
fell on a few years ago when it went out
of the dividend list, the CBA was
anxious to veil another adverse experi-
ence. Yet surely the achievements of
General Credits since Mr. D. G. Mc-
Omish, one of the CBA’s chief inspec-
tors, moved in as general manager erase
any stain on the bank’s escutcheon. One
would imagine net revenue from the HP
side, which provided more than 10
percent of last year’s profit, has been
somewhat higher than, say, from the
bank’s wholly owned savings banks here
and in N.Z. The savings banks at least
get an honorable mention in the his-
tory, as does the CBA’s joint venture
with three overseas banks in Midland
and International Banks Ltd. a couple
of years ago.

Battle for the Pacific
THE 20 United States airlines which
will present their cases for licences
on the transpacific routes to the
U.S. Civil Aeronautics Board on
November 15 are expected to spend
more than ten million dollars on this
presentation before the conclusion of
the hearings toward the end of 1967 at
the earliest.
The five airlines most vitally in-
terested in the South Pacific route and
given any chance of obtaining a licence
are: American Airlines, Braniff, Con-
tinental, Eastern, and United. All except
Braniff have had top-line executives
from their head offices visiting Austra-
lia on public-relations missions since
May.
When the actual hearings begin in
Honolulu on February 15, the airlines
will fight over the right to operate a
second U.S. service to Australia in com-
petition with Pan-American Airways, at
present the sole U.S. flag carrier to this
area. Airline executives generally re-
gard the South Pacific route as a plum.
Eastern Airlines and United Air
Lines have so far put in the biggest
effort. It is not too late for other
airlines to follow. For the third time
in five months, Eastern executives have
visited Australia. The first time a party
led by Mr. Arthur D. Lewis, senior
vice-president, held functions in Syd-
ney, Melbourne, and Canberra for all
the people who mattered.
Last July, Mr. Charles G. Braden,
Regional Director Pacific, made a
special trip from Honolulu to address
the Australian Federation of Travel
Agents. And at the end of September,
Mr. Braden was accompanied to Aus-
tralia by Mr. George Gordon, Vice-
President Marketing, and Mr., James
Mortonsen, Vice-President of Young
jnd Rubicam' Inc., advertising agency
for Eastern. They were not only meet-
ing people but they were out to get
what information they could.
They saw 4 executives of ANTA,
Ansett-ANA, TAA, and Quantas to
study their plans for the future.
What might be called the South
Pacific department at Eastern now
numbers some 30 senior personnel.
Their alloted task has been to study
Australia and the South Pacific econo-
mically and culturally.
"JJNITED Air Lines had its president,
Mr. G. E. Keck, visit Australia last
July and they gave a “very polished
exposition” of United’s case for the
South Pacific route. United is the
world’s largest airline by far in terms
of passenger miles and numbers of
passengers carried (more than 20 mil-
lion passengers a year). United’s presi- (
dent has now sent a prestige color
brochure to all those people he met in
Australia, setting out in detail United’s
case for the South Pacific route.
Eastern has so far not selected an
Australian manager. A number of
people have been considered, from air-
line sales executives to top level and
well-known airline chiefs. United has
its own office in Sydney with Mr. Bill
Hyde, well known in the Australian
WHILE the U.S. airlines battle
for rights across the Pacific,
strong pressure for fare-
cutting on Pacific routes appears to
have been rejected at the Honolulu
meeting of the International Air
Transport Agreement, which re-
quired unanimity in such decisions
and which adjourned at the week-
end.
Canadian Pacific pressed for a 20
percent fare cut, but all other air-
lines on this route opposed this,
offering reductions only on special
tickets. Pan-American and UTA
wanted a 25 percent cut on round-
trip excursions (CPA asked for a 40
percent cut!), but Qantas preferred
to limit reductions (of 30 percent)
to tourist? on “all-included tours’’ of
at least 21 days, which would then
cost only 10 percent more than the
normal fare, on the grounds that
tourism is the growth sector and
ordinary round-trip reductions
would not attract more businessmen
passengers.
travel industry as director for Southern
Asia and South Pacific.
American Airlines and Trans World
Airlines also have their own offices.
Braniff is represented by a firm headed
by Mr. Charles J. Henry, who was
Pan-Am’s director in Australia during
the ’sos. Trans World Airlines, one of
America’s big three, also has an office
in Sydney but the airline is likely to
place more emphasis on its application
across the Pacific to complete its round-
the-world routes than on the South
Pacific routes.
Eastern and United seem to have the
big advantage of having springboards
for the South Pacific route, Eastern
from Mexico City, and United from
Honolulu.
Eastern Airlines believes that
the Mexican springboard gives it a
strong case for becoming the second
carrier, as it does not duplicate Pan-
Am’s service from the U.S. West Coast
to the South Pacific area.
But its strongest point may still be
that it could generate vastly increased
business to the South Pacific with its
$U.5.26 million annual advertising ex-
penditure spent among the thickly
populated eastern United States. The
airline believes that dt could multiply
several times within a few years the
30,000 people a year travelling to the
South Pacific at present.
All this should not make Qantas too
unhappy, as it must get a large share
of the business generated by the vast
advertising expenditure of whichever
leading U.S. airline gets the licence,
expenditure which the Australian air-
line is quite unable to match. Qantas
has already proved that it can gain
the confidence of U.S. nationals, as it
is now carrying more than half of all
Americans travelling to the South
Pacific.

THE bonus share fad—handing out

is not as silly as its detractors
make out. But it does present the stock-

shares in the companies practising the

The philosophical argument about

generally been on the point that these

and that they do not represent any in-
crease in a shareholder’s equity in his
company.
In fact, however, they do represent
a tangible increase in the dividend com-
mitment to shareholders an increase
that is worth money. And because of the
negotiability of an extra share, it is
worth more in market terms than a
simple promise by directors to pay a
higher dividend on existing shares. But,
in reality, that is what it means.
And despite all the newfangled in-
vestment theories that have come into
vogue in the last decade it is what
shareholders are getting (or expect to
get) in dividends that matters in the
end.
And then there are all the other
advantages like shareholders avoiding
paying tax on dividends, if no dividends
are paid in cash. For the bonus shares
would come from capital reserves, not
taxable revenue reserves. But even this
can be misunderstood.
There is no question of sneakily
beating the tax man on this; the bonus
shares mean that more money is going
to be handed out in dividends in the
future and therefore more tax will be
paid. It only defers the date of the tax
payment —but increases the amount.
The only danger in this device is
that it may be used by companies whose
boards may not be genuine in their
desire not to pay dividends for capital-
raising purposes; it may be used to mask
serious liquidity problerhs on a day-to-
day basis without the money to be re-
tained being used in expansion that
would create increased earnings for the
future. For that is the point of the
whole exercise.
BRISBANE broker Corrie & Co.,
always a lively firm, has taken
issue with the market over the
pricing of Mt. Isa shares. He argues
strongly in a circular to clients that the
higher local copper price would bring
a considerable increase in Mt. Isa’s
earnings for no additional cost and
without any further increase in pro-
duction. And with the $2B million
K 57 shaft and No. 2 concentrator aimed
at lifting production by 50 percent he
says: “Blind Freddie can see what this
will mean in terms of profits and bene-
fits to shareholders. But in pricing the
shares at $4.40 the market apparently
can’t.” So he urges clients into the
stock, pointing out that the 2.2 percent
yield from the indicated 20 percent
dividend is the highest the market has
seen in years.
Back in April, THE BULLETIN
The Chartist says:
ASSOCIATED PULP & PAPER MILLS LTD. was included in the survey on
paper stocks (THE BULLETIN, March 12, 1966) and at that particular
time had formed a base to support a rise to approximately the $2.25 level,
although no definite uptrend had been confirmed. After rising to a high point
of $1.74 in January of this year, prices have fallen back toward the base level at
$1.35 and it has become evident over recent weeks that the situation is deteriorating
technically and investors could expect the stock to fall to a more pessimistic down-
side objective between 95c and $l.OO.
The present time is a critical one for this stock, and sales below $1.30 could be
viewed seriously owing to an absence of support levels back to 1960. Although the
price movements over the past seven years could be regarded as somewhat
cyclical, any break in the 1965/6 support level at $1.34 would indicate that the
stock could be about to resume a major downtrend and should be avoided by
investors. Last sale price on 4/10/66 —$1.36.

noted the “exquisite timing” of Corrie
& Co.’s recommendation to clients to
quit Ansett shares (they were then
about 78 cents) and switch to Comeng
(then $1.14) for “political” reasons.
How have clients gone? Corrie was right
about the profit trends of these com-
panies but so far he has not been able
to show any great stockmarket victory,
for despite Comeng’s 33 percent profit
rise and Ansett’s increase of only 13
percent, the market for both has eased
slightly since April (with most of the
Ansett fall being apparently due to
the bearish Corrie circular at that
ti me )- #
In any event, Corries last week once
agam urged clients out of Ansett (whose
Queensland image would not be too
good right now) and into Comeng
which effectively suggests that in in-
vestment the railway is the safer way.
NOW that the drought really has
broken, the anti-cyclical investors
could be sparing a thought for
the agricultural equipment industry,
which has quite sensibly taken a bat-
tering in the market during the past
year or so. In particular, Ralph
McKay, the Borg-Warner associate
that makes discs for ploughs (and a
sizable range of farm machinery) seems
to have reached an interesting stage.
Last year’s profit fell 12£ percent, not
a bad result in the circumstances.
The drought “materially affected”
sales of discs and tractor wheels and
rims, but the company says things are
improving; it made an unstated capi-
tal profit when it sold its $70,000
Wheels and Rims interest (which had
not yet provided a dividend but had
contributed rent) and this additional
cash will add to the plentiful liquid
funds of $150,000 in the books at June,
Last year the market thought this stock
was worth over $2, but it is now sell-
ing at only $1.25; by next year it
should have gone some of the way back
toward that level,
A S on numerous other trade fronts,
Australian Paper Manufacturers
has a close ally in NZ Forest
Product’s chairman, Mr. W. L. Wyber,
in its annoyance that Tasman Pulp and
Paper is planning to superimpose the
manufacture of packaging board for
the Australian market on its pre-
dominantly pulp and newsprint opera-
tion. Mr. Wyber’s irritation, expressed
at his company’s annual meeting in
Auckland last week, was all the
stronger because as well as the threat
of competition from Tasman Board
in his own sphere, apparently the NZ
Government had been fully informed
about Tasman’s decision from the start
and had condoned it despite its pos-
sible repercussions on the working of
the Australian-New Zealand trade
agreement.
Since APM recently announced it
was stopping buying pulp from Tas-
man, obviously something will have to
be done to stop the tit for tat be-
fogging of the rationalisation of timber
products relations supposed to be
inspired by the trade agreement. In
the meantime, however, NZ Forest
Products itself is playing ball and its
übiquitious exporting activities, coupled
with its current expansion, evoke inter-
est in the shares, the more so in view
of the highly satisfactory result for the
past year to March, 1966, when earn-
ings rose from 15.5 to 18.9 percent and
the dividend was pushed up to 9 per-
cent after five successive years at 8
percent.
As the “NZ Economist and Tax-
payer” notes in recommending the shares
(which have fluctuated between 302
and 260 on Australian exchanges this
year and are currently around 275 to
yield, 4.1 percent on dividend, and
8.6 percent earnings), the profit and
dividend lift this year makes them
statistically cheap. Behind all that, it
emphasises that NZ Forests is in an
industry basic to NZ and the continua-
tion of its expansive trends may be
expected.
GOING hand in hand with Myers to
the latter’s new Northland shop-
ping centre at Preston (opened
with some assuring side-remarks about
democratic share ownership to Mr.
Calwell by Sir Henry Bolte last week)
is one of Melbourne’s oldest and most
esteemed retailing companies, The
Leviathan. As last week’s potted history
tells us, the Leviathan has been trading
on the comer of Swanston and Bourke
Streets for 114 years or so (Myers has
only been in Bourke Street since 1912).
While more a minnow than a levia-
than compared with Myers, in recent
years the company has been in a more
expansive mood than at any time in its
long history, having gone as far afield
as Queensland, where its new subsidiary
had a record profit in the year to July
31, up 9.2 percent. Overall, the group
reported its own result to be 11 percent
higher, contrast to the slender after-tax
improvement in Myers reported last
week. The Leviathan offers a dividend
yield of 7.3 percent (more than twice
Myers’ 3.1 percent) covered by earnings
of 11.6 as against. Myers’ cover of only
7.1 percent.
MARKET cynics are wondering
what lies behind the 32 percent
rise in the market price of
shares in the unimpressive Sydney in-
vestment company Reinvestment (Aus-
tralia) Ltd. at a time when the stock-
market as a whole, in which its funds
are invested, has done nothing.
Reinvestment’s $2 shares are now
around their 1966 peak of $1.85 (or only
25c below their asset backing) after
being as low as $1.40 earlier this year.
The company is not due to begin pay-
ing dividends for another eight years.
The rise does not appear to be due
to the recent result for 1965-66 —unless

NEW ADDITION TO

the market was expressing its pleasure
that the company avoided any further
capital erosion. For in the year to June,
Reinvestment’s net profit (after one-
fifth of its total income went to man-
agement and directors’ fees) rose only
fractionally to $49,000. This, a 4.3
percent return on capital, would have
added only 8.6 cents a share to the
assets backing (so providing almost all
the latest year’s rise).
If the reason for the 45 cent rise
in the share price while the assets back-
ing (the key to value in a non-dividend-
paying investment company) increased
by only 10 cents, was another possible
takeover offer, the company is un-
aware of it. Last year the Cowan In-
vestment Service Group made an offer
which was rejected by the board and
did not proceed.
This board is made up of four dir-
ectors, Messrs. B. J. D. Page, C. H.
Locke, R. N. Cadwallader, and E. R.
Griffin who together hold close to 40
public company directorships, and a
secretary-director who is an accountant.
As could be expected with a boom-
time investment company float of seven
years ago, the company suffered an im-
mediate reverse when the market col-
lapsed. After one year it had lost 30
cents of its $2 assets. By June last year
it had managed to struggle back to par
in assets backing but only because
its undistributed earnings over that
time had totalled 35 cents.
The latest balance sheet shows that
the market value of a portfolio that cost
$1,370,000 was still only $1,203,000
but the 8.6 cents increase in undis-
tributed earnings to almost 44 cents a
share lifted the assets backing to $2.10.
So shareholders who have done without
dividends for six years have in offect
earned 10 cents per $2 share (or less
than 1 percent a year) on their money.
Unfortunately the company is still
picking a few bad ones; the latest
accounts showed that Reinvestment had
added a further 5000 shares in Boral
(of which Mr. Griffin is managing dir-
ector) to its portfolio at an average
price of almost $2 during 1965-66. They
are now $1.65.
THE stockmarket does not seem to
think so, but there is money to
be made in mortgages. Shares in
Trade Credits, whose small size is
something of a market disadvantage,
are now yielding 9 percent, although
the largest part of the company’s funds
are secured on real estate mortgages.
The company has just come out with
a further increase in earning rate from
23f percent to percent. Reserves
are more than half the paid capital,
assets backing is more than $3.20 a $2
share (around the price the shares are
now getting in the market), and the
price-earnings ratio is very low at only
b. 9 times.
The management apparently knows
how to run the business in bad times
as well as good the dividend record
has been unbroken since 1936 and
annual payout has been 15 percent for
the past 12 years.

MINING
Falls For the Barriers
IT did not need the recent lower
profits from the Barriers to point
home the fact that the boom in lead
and zinc prices had ended. At least one
leading Australian stockbroking firm,
Ord Minnett T. J. Thompson and
Partners pointed that out clearly in
a comprehensive publication last
February.
It is worth going back to the con-
clusions reached by that survey now
that the market appears uncertain of
where it is going in lead and zinc.
The broking firm then said that the
outlook for lead prices over the three
years to 1968 “cannot be viewed
optimistically” when seen against pro-
jected increases in world production
and consumption, and that production
may be expected to be in excess of
consumption by 1968. For zinc, it
said the growth rate in demand is likely
to ease while production is already
ahead of consumption with the result
that the zinc market must become more
competitive. This seems to be what
is now happening.
But the Australian stockmarkets have
not become depressed by this. Prices
for North Broken Hill shares rose last
week after the news that the lower
profit was not as bad as forecast and
that dividend had been held. At
around $3.72 they are not much below
the year’s best of $3.88, and are his-
torically quite high.
For Broken Hill South shares, the
situation is confused by prospects from
copper (which has not yet done nearly
as well as hoped) and aluminium, as
lead and zinc takes a diminishing role
in its expectations. But South’s shares
have recovered to $2.55, almost back
to the $2.60 level that obtained before
the poor profit news and lower dividend
of two weeks ago. This is also his-
torically high.
LONDON COMMODITY PRICES
Are the lead-zinc miners overpriced?
There are suggestions that the outlook
for these metals is not as bad as in re-
cent downturns because the world in-
dustry is dominated by large-scale min-
ing companies who have greater con-
trol of production than for other metals,
there is less Government interference,
and no political problems. The elim-
ination of the Korean War stockpiles
and control of overcapacity, it is
argued, have left lead-zinc in a far
healthier basic position with the result
that while prices will continue to fluc-
tuate there is every chance that exces-
sive swings either way will be short-
lived.
But the fact remains that lead prices
moved below £stg.B3 a ton on the Lon-
don Metal Exchange last week for the
first time since April 27, 1964. And
zinc prices, after several weeks of
strength due to technical market factors
and “influential” buying, began to
weaken again and had dropped back
to £97 a ton for spot zinc.
On probable production and demand
trends further weaknesses for both
metals, including cuts in the £lO2 a ton
producer zinc price, are virtually en-
sured.
The Squeeze on Grapes
THE current bonus share issue from
Lindemans and ten percent profit
rise from Penfolds shows that
things are going very well indeed for the
winemakers. But many grapegrowers,
particularly in South Australia, are
far from happy.
The Federal Grapegrowers’ Council
of Australia has written to the
“Bulletin” saying that a recent article
(“B.” August 20), “Penfolds breaks
South Australian links,” needed some
“drastic correction” and presented “the
facts regarding comparative grape
prices.”
The letter from G. W. Lucas, the
Council’s secretary, says: “Your corres-
pondent states that the switch to N.S.W.
of Penfolds winemaking activities is
largely the result of a difference in
grape prices of about $6.00 per ton.
This statement is belied by the list
below of prices paid for the 1966 vin-
tage in Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area
and in South Australia:
Per Ton
S.A. N.S.W.
Gordo 543-50 $50.00
Grenache 46 00 45.00
Pedro 44.00 46.00
Palomino 46.00 48.00
Sultana 42.50 44.00
D o rad i 110 43.00 40.00
“These varieties account for 95 per-
cent of the wine production. Further-
more in the MIA, a bonus is paid on
grapes which ripen to above-standard
sugar content, which in an average vin-
tage could add another $2 to prices.
“In accounting for Penfold’s policy
of gradual withdrawal from South Aus-
tralia, where it has received a century
of support from the thousands of small
grapegrowers who must now seek alter-
native outlets for their traditionally
excellent grapes, let the facts be known
and not misrepresented in an effort to
pin the responsibility for this loss to
South Australia upon a government
which was forced to protect these pro-
ducers.
“Despite constant rising costs the
level of grape prices has advanced in-
significantly in the past decade, growers
being faced with economic problems
beyond their control.
“Price negotiation in the 1966 vintage
failed completely, necessitating protect-
ive action by the Government, and it
is interesting to note that, despite cries
of ruination by winemakers when prices
were gazetted at a figure midway be-
tween what was asked for and what
was offered, not one grape was left on
the vines.
“While on the one hand winemakers
have ‘never had it so good’ judging

by their published earnings, grape-
growers are wondering how long their
credit with banks and packing sheds will
stand the strain.”
One of the major factors in the move
to N.S.W. by the two big “listed” wine
companies has been the freight question,
and it is on freight that the letter from
Mr. Lucas first appears to break down.
The prices he quotes for South Australia
seem to be those on the River Murray
irrigation area, but there is a freight
charge of $6 a ton, on average, that
companies who process these grapes in
the Barossa Valley have to pay for cart-
age, while Murrumbidgee Irrigation
Area prices are quoted as delivered at
the winemaker’s cellar door.
But cost is not the only consideration.
Unfortunate as the winegrowers’ pos-
ition may be, it seems at least partly due
to the fact that they have not been able
to adapt to the changes taking place
in the wine industry—particularly the
swing from fortified to table wines.
The grape varieties listed in Mr.
Lucas’ letter are claimed to represent
95 percent of wine production. But
most of these varieties represent the
production of fortified wines or forti-
fying spirit, which ignores the point
that 10 years ago production was 80
percent fortified wines and 20 percent
table wines, whereas today the relation
between these two types is 60 percent
to 40 percent, and table wines are
mainly responsible for the increase in
wine sales.
WINEMAKERS claim that, regard-
less of advice they gave about re-
planting or extension of areas such as
Loxton, little notice was taken by
growers of the recommendations for the
planting of table wine varieties. In con-
sequence the S.A. winemakers are still
forced to depend largely upon their
own plantings for their raw material
for table wines—despite considerable
increases in Rhine Riesling and Caber-
net Sauvignon prices offered by makers
to encourage the planting of these
varieties. And as the major market
for wines produced in Australia is
N.S.W. and Victoria, this constitutes a
further 20-25 cents increase in freight
to these markets.
Mr. Lucas’ comment that, despite the
increases in S.A. grape prices, no single
grape was left on the vines failed to
mention that there was a considerable
drop in the harvest by comparison
with the past five years, and that this
was the cause of the full intake. An-
other omission was that the growers’
pool was still holding considerable
stocks of brandy produced for them
in order to absorb past surpluses against
a market demand that was falling,
owing to excise increases in the 1965
Budget.
And to make it all the more disturb-
ing, the contest between the L-CL and
Labor in South Australia for the seat
°f Chaffey, which is by no means a
blue ribbon seat to either party, has
resulted in grape prices entering the
Political arena.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
In a generally quiet market, interest focused on rights issues,
especially G. J. Coles and Petersville, and a special sale of
Western Mining rights made their volume heavy.
The market for ACI, F. W. Williams, and Pioneer was
sensitive to influences in the takeover contest for Williams.
Recovering from a six-year low, Burns Philp put on a total
38c to $3.88. Aberfoyle Tin lost 22c to $1.90 as investors tired
of waiting for a dividend.

Caught Out on Brambles
THE stockmarket did not like the
fall in pre-tax profit and lower
* earning rate announced by
Brambles Industries Ltd. at the end of
T u ly. Since then the shares have fallen
from $1.78 to $1.47 (they had been as
high as $1.92 earlier in the year). And
the chartists think that the 50-cent
shares, now yielding 5.1 percent, could
even drop a bit further in keeping with
the continuing slide in the road trans-
port group of companies.
But Brambles’ shares have fallen
enough to make them interesting on
several points-
The market’s uneasiness about pro-
fits appears to stem from the fact that
the company’s pre-tax profit‘fell by
$257,000 or 8 percent, a point directors
have so far failed to mention in their
annual report, which speaks only in
terms of net profit' (up marginally by
$26,000 after an unexplained cut in
taxation from $1.4 million to $l.l
million).
But the company’s heavy expenditure
on its expansion program, which has
involved substantial cash raisings (last
year $2.6m. through debentures and
$2.4m. through shares) would presum-
ably have resulted in significant taxation
benefits and no doubt the chairman will
make that point at this month’s annual
meeting. In addition, depreciation total-
ling about sBm. in the past three years,
plus profits retained, have generated
large sums internally.
However, there does appear another
source of market uncertainty in the
sharply different experience the com-
pany has reported for the first half com-
pared with the second half of 1965-66.
Business appeared to have slowed
down considerably in the second six
months, with pre-tax profit being about
25 percent lower than in the first half.
This is not the usual situation; in the
previous year, second-half profits were
well above the first half’s.
No doubt this will be discussed at
the annual meeting. And the doubling
of stocks and work in progress over
the past year to June and the increase
in debtors from $5.7m. to $7.3m. after
increased doubtful debts provision of
$297,000 will probably be the subject
of comment from the chairman also.
But even with the tax concessions
due on the heavy expenditure on plant,
tax is still more than 45 percent of
pre-tax profit (excluding non-taxable in-
vestment income). And it is also worth
noting that this company, has become in
the past two years a very generous pro-
vider in relation to its stated net profit,
as it appears to keep on the side of
caution by over-depreciating as the
continual profits earned on the sale of
fixed assets testifies. In 1965-66 an-
other $BO,OOO came into the accounts
that way.
And, on a more mundane note, it
seems that the company had at least
another $200,000 dollars due to it last
year in dividends which will not be
seen in the books until 1966-67. For
Brambles’ 50 percent holding in Brec-
kett Pty. Ltd. means that it will share
the $1 million dividend (up $400,000)
declared by Breckett for the year to
December, 1965. In the 1965-66
accounts, Brambles’ total investment in-
come totalled only $438,941 (a rise of
less than $20,000 from the previous
year). It is evident that the $200,000
increase to $£ million in the Breckett
dividend due to Brambles had not been
paid by last balance date as the com-
pany clearly runs well behind in taking
its Breckett dividends into account. This
should give profits a healthy boost this
year.
Breckett Pty., owned equally with
Heckett Engineering Co., of Pennsyl-
vania, won a ten-year contract in 1956
to recover steel scraps from the BHP
open-hearth slag and refuses at New-
castle and Port Kembla. This was re-
negotiated in 1964-65 on a lower pro
rata basis and to cover the new steel-
works at Whyalla.
Brambles is a company well worth
looking at not only because of a likely
improvement in traditional operations
but because its heavy capital expendi-
ture should begin to pay off in a few
years, the trend to containerisation
should bring benefits to its transport
side, and its significant moves into steel
merchandising should also prove re-
warding. This company is one that
should recover sharply in the stock-
markets in any economic upswing.

STETSON STROLLER-
get with the
stetson 100 k...
the look of success
in lightweight felts
In over a hundred years the Stetson
look of success hasn’t changed a bit.
But the styles certainly have. Every
season Stetson is way out in front with
the right shapes, the right shades to top
the newest suits. And this new ‘Stroller’
is a typical Stetson hat-trick—a versa-
tile, lightweight, plain felt sporting a
handsome plaited band. With the feather
mount it’s a casual—without it, a for-
mal. Just one fine example of over 50
Stetson stylings for Spring/Summer—
at all leading men’s hat stores. Get with
the Stetson look now!
STETSON
• y "*,
Here's the ‘Centennial’, one
of the more conservative
Stetson plain felts.
In popular patterns, too!

More Copper Ups and Downs
WITH the Australian copper price
now moving in sympathy with
the London Metal Exchange,
there are certain to be many more
sudden moves like last week’s when
the local price was increased from $950
to $lO5O a ton.
And as LME prices have since risen
even further to about $l2OO, the pros-
pects are that Australian prices could
take another sudden, if short-lived,
jump. Since Australian copper pro-
ducers decided on August 8 to get
closer into line with world prices to
stop fabricators taking substantial
profits out of exporting copper, and
lifted their' price from $B7O to $1250
a ton, the price has swung down to
$ll5O on August 16 and then to $950
on August 24.
No matter what the long-term price
implications of the latest U.S.-Chilean
$U.5.500 million expansion program,
aimed at doubling Chile’s output to
1.2 million tons within five years, the
short-term picture is of more ups and
downs in price as “unforeseen develop-
ments” continue to upset the copper
market.
The most dramatic of last week’s
“unforeseen developments” was the
flooding of 500 feet of the 1900-foot
main shaft at a Roan Selection Trust
mine on the Zambian Copperbelt. In
1965-66 the mine produced 23,000
tons of the RST group’s 281,000 tons
copper output.
In the U.S., a strike at Anuconda’s
Inspiration Copper property also gave
prices a boost on the London Metal
Exchange. The strike comes at a
time when U.S. consumers are buying
on the London Metal Exchange and
other overseas markets at high prices
to meet military needs.
But the main attention of traders
was focused on yet another facet
of the Rhodesia-Zambia dispute. Be-
cause Zambia has been concentrating
on using alternative rail routes to the
sea, to minimise payments to the rebel
Rhodesian regime, the Zambian system
is short of rolling stock.
Copper’s problems continue to
engender their own, drastic solutions.
The breakthrough for stainless-steel
water pipes, which came during the
1964-65 copper price boom, is con-
tinuing as stainless producers stress the
price stability of their product.
GLOOM about the economic outlook
in Britain, the U.S., and Western
Europe has spread to the wool
market, where prices have steadily eased
since the current season began. Coming
weeks should give a pointer to whether
or not the gloom is well-based.
Higher interest rates around the
world, which raise the cost of holding
stocks in the wool textile industry, have
been cited as another cause of the
early weakness. If so, demand should
pick up as stocks reach their new limits.
Britain is still an important factor in
the world industry, and the economic
measures there add some weight to the
bearish side of the picture. But if
world consumer demand does not
suffer the downturn the industry fears,
buyers who have held off may re-enter
the market later in the season.
MOVES toward a new world con-
ference on sugar began in
London late last month with a
preparatory Working Group meeting.
Should the preliminary talks show
signs of progress a full-scale meeting
might be held next year.
But Cuba’s intransigence may again
be a major factor reports say that
Dr. Castro had not bothered to send a
delegate to the preliminary talks. L
is not thought that the recent hurricane
which passed through Cuba has done
important damage to sugar plantations.

THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT- significant growth from an idea
How many people know as they use thousands of tons of
Australian-made paper in stationery, books, magazines
and printed brochures that behind this highly organised
regular supply lies an unusual story of progress.
Thirty years ago, all our fine paper was imported because
pulp for this paper came from long-fibred wood, of which
Australia had little. Despite those who said it could not
be done, pulp for fine paper was made here from our own
short-fibred eucalypt trees and a great new industry,
Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Limited, was born.
From idea to idea, process to process, quality to quality,
right through to catering for most of Australia’s needs
in fine paper, the company’s large mill at Burnie, Tasmania,
has never stopped developing its resources and its
products. This saves us millions of pounds in overseas
exchange every year.
And the long and short of Australia’s growth, too, is the
ability to stand on our own feet and develop our own ideas.

SECURITY analysis
Competition for Wormalds
A check to rapidly rising earnings
WILD CAT PAGES
ALTHOUGH there are many that
will argue that investors are
more concerned with “earnings”
than with dividends, it is a matter of
record that the price of shares of Wor-
mald Bros, has fallen 20 percent since
it was announced that the final divi-
dend would be reduced from 5 cents to
3 cents per share. During the same
period, Group 10 of the Sydney Stock
Exchange share price index has fallen
only 2.4 percent.
In making the announcement that
the dividend would be reduced to pre-
serve cash, the directors stated they
felt that the general liquidity position
nationally was so tight that it was
essential to retain a larger proportion
of earnings to reinforce the company’s
cash position during the coming year.
There is every reason to agree with
the directors, and conservation of funds
in such circumstances should therefore
be regarded as a prudent step by a
Board which has the long term interest
of the shareholders at heart. One there-
fore wonders why the market should
have marked down the price of Wor-
mald Bros.’ shares so severely.
During 1965-6, earnings per share
were approximately 13.8 cents, which
is slightly higher than the previous
year’s figure of 13.3 cents. If we regard
the 1962-3 and the 1963-4 years as
rather exceptional, then there would
seem to be a fairly good reason for
assuming that, on average, Wormald
Bros, can earn about 13.5 cents per
share. This figure would appear to be
the average earnings per share for the
1961-2, 1964-5, and 1965-6 years. The
shares are currently selling at only
8.3 times this figure, whereas I would
normally have expected them to be
selling at ten times earnings.
JT may be as well to study other
profitability ratios to see whether the
trends are at all different to those of
published per share earnings, for clearly
the market is anticipating a fall in
profits during 1966-7 probably to about
the earnings level of 1963-4.
One profitability ratio which can be
studied with a certain amount of con-
fidence in this case is the ratio of net
profit before tax, depreciation, and in-
terest on long term debt to t,otal
capital employed. Over the period from
30th June, 1962, to 30th June, 1966,
total capital employed has increased
V $2,675,000 and, of this amount,
$912,000 represents net loan raisings.
The word “net” is used advisedly be-
cause the loan capital at 30th June,
1963, is about the same as at 30th
June, 1966. In other words, the whole
the increase occurred between 30th
June, 1962, and 30th June, 1963. Re-
serves—mainly retained profits in-
creased by $1,048,000 and the minority
interests also increased by $566,000.
The remainder of the increase was in
“Long term provisions,” for other capi-
tal remained unchanged during the
period apart from the conversion of
the convertible notes to ordinary shares
in July, 1962.
The trend in the ratio of net profit
before tax, depreciation, and interest to
total capital has been:
Year to 30th June 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Percentage 15 7 10.2 14 5 16 '6 16.3
Index 1962-100 100 '65 92 106 ‘lO4
This would be quite a good record
over a period which has been notori-
ous for reducing profit margins and
falling profitability. It is also interest-
ing to note that a strong recovery was
made from the very depressed levels
of 1963.
If we look at profits before tax and
depreciation that were available to the
ordinary shareholders of Wormald
Bros, and relate these to ordinary share-
holders’ funds, we would get a good idea
of the way the ordinary shareholders’
share of group profits has been increas-
ing. The figures are:
Year to 30th June 1962 1963 1964 1965 1956
Percentage 20 0 12.0 17 8 22.3 20.7
Index 1962-100 100 60 89 111 103
While the variations are a little
wider, the trend in these two ratios is
almost identical. In the latter the drop
in the ratio for 1965-6 is perhaps a
little more marked.
Another ratio which can be calcu-
lated is the adjusted earnings per share.
In this case, we make an assumption
that the whole of the pre-tax profit was
subject to tax at the full tax rate opera-
ting in Australia. As the group com-
prised 59 Australian subsidiaries at
June 30, 1966, in addition to 19 New
Zealand subsidiaries, there is a rather
large measure of estimation in this
particular ratio. It is, however, a
measure of pre-tax earnings per share,
and the figures are as follows:
Year to 30th June 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Cents 11.6 5.8 8.9 14 1 13 5
Index 1962-100 100 50 77 121 116
Again there is evidence of a strong
recovery from the low point of 1962-3
followed by a downturn in 1965-6.
Wormald Bros’ connection with the
building industry is a little tenuous.
The 1966 annual report shows that
the group is divided now into five
basic divisions: fire protection, elec-
trics, “Steelbilt” (office furniture and
equipment), Metalbilt (rolling shutters,
grilles, fire doors, sliding door track),
and air-conditioning. In addition, there
are six subsidiaries covering printing
and publishing, spray painting equip-
ment, security equipment, electrical
and electronic equipment, fire protec-
tion chemicals and medical safety
equipment, clothing and allied products.
Three of these divisions, fire protection,
electrics, and air-conditioning, would be
dependent on the level of new non-
dwelling building activity, but the re-
maining activities hardly depend on
new building. Unfortunately, we have
no idea of the contribution that the
various divisions make to the group
profit.
It is perhaps significant that the
downturn in Wormald Bros.’ share price
has coincided to some extent with sug-
gestions that the level of non-dwelling
building will tend to fall during 1966-7,
but it is more likely that investors are
concerned that the fierce competition
that seemed to have caused the sharp
decline in profit in 1962-3 may recur
during 1966-7. Certainly, if earnings
per share and dividends per share are
to fluctuate in the future as they have
done over the past five years, it is
difficult to suggest a suitable price for
the shares.
T HE average dividend over the past
five years has been 8.2 cents per
share and the average earnings (on the
adjusted basis) would be 10.8 cents per
share. Over a longer period (seven
years), the overall trend in adjusted
earnings per share has been downwards,
but only slightly.
Even though the shares are now sell-
ing at their lowest point for nearly a
decade, it is impossible to say that, in
today’s market, they are under-
valued. If it should be proved next
year that the check to the rapidly rising
earning rate (from 1962-3) was only
temporary, then a marked upward
revision of the price level would be
necessary.

Rothmans of Pall Mall
(AUSTRALIA) LIMITED
ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN
Twelfth Annual General Meeting, 1966
The increase in excise on cigarettes and the
general economic conditions were unfavourable
to the quality market in the past financial year.
At the same time, costs of tobacco and labour
increased, while the market was generally dis-
turbed by extensive price-cutting at retail level.
Under these circumstances the net profit for the
year is a good effort. It is almost as high as the
1965 record, even after charging off various
exceptional items set out in the Directors’ Report.
The total cigarette market grew by about 5%
over the previous year, and the Company did not
participate in this, so that its share of the market
fell. This was not viewed lightly or optimistically
by the Board, but carefully prepared plans to
regain this position could be implemented only
when the time was favourable,
The first step was the introduction of “Puro-
Thresh” tobaccos, matured under a new process
which improves the smoothness and smoking
quality of the cigarette. A similar process is being
adopted in many parts of the world, including
overseas factories of companies associated with
other Australian manufacturers. It is important
to note that your Company has at least two to
three years’ start on its competitors, who cannot
even commence to use the process 1 before next
year’s Australian auctions, and must then wait for
the tobacco to mature. The Company’s brands
used tobaccos matured under this process from
February 1966.
Rothmans enjoys a very high reputation for
insistence on quality. As I have said on earlier
occasions, we were not prepared to produce a
cigarette brand for the lower-priced market unless
it would meet fully our concept of quality. In the
face of rising costs, the economics of launching a
brand to compete with the cheap and medium
market were unsatisfactory without a change in
the price structure. When this took place on
Ist July last, the plans for this sector became
feasible.
You will be glad to know that the “Grenadiers”
brand, released on Ist July at 35 cents for 20, has
met with instant acceptance. Its volume of sale at
this point of time is well ahead of target and it is
expected to take a sizeable share of the market as
the full marketing campaign develops. There is
every reason for it to succeed, because it has
demonstrable points of superiority over competi-
tive brands.
Simultaneously, another notable move was
made. Rothmans King Size Filter was made even
longer than before and was also increased in
weight and content of tobacco. Hitherto, there
was little noticeable difference between the speci-
fications of cigarettes in the quality market and
those in the cheaper market, although cheaper
cigarettes were less in diameter and/or in length,
quite apart from tobacco content and quality.
Now there is a demonstrable superiority i fl
Rothmans King Size Filter.


The new extended size of Rothmans King Size
Filter sets a new standard of dimension and
tobacco content for the quality market, but even
more important is the fact that it has improved
the smoothness of smoking quality. This action
immediately places a number of brands selling at
the quality price in a worse competitive position.
The brand was the only one to give extra value at
the time of the price increase.
At this point, it may interest you to know that
there is not one competitor’s brand which sells as
much as 50% of Rothmans King Size, and claims
of increases by various well-advertised brands
often relate to market shares in each case of com-
paratively small volume mainly between 5% and
71% of the total market.
The change in price structure of the industry
at Ist July, 1966, had our fullest support and
approval. It must undoubtedly curtail the degree
of price-cutting which has been going on and give
the industry better stability. It will restore the
earnings of retailers and distributors to a reason-
able level.
Excise duty has loomed large in our destiny in
the last two years, and it is appropriate for me to
say something about this form of tax.
I do not want to appear plaintive about this,
because excise changes are a natural hazard of
our business, and the tax is a well-established and
major form of government revenue.
However, it is a doubtful economic weapon,
at least when applied to cigarettes. Far from curb-
ing purchases, increased excise adds to pressures
for higher wages, without creating any improve-
ment in productivity to justify such increases, and
this is more the case with cigarettes than any other
commodity. Experience in the United Kingdom
is an outstanding illustration.
Under the system applied in Australia, move-
ment in excise produces an inequitable result.
Excise duty on cigarettes is based on the total
weight of the cigarette, including tobacco, filter,
cork and paper. Every one of the Company’s
brands has a higher weight than competitors at
similar retail prices, so that an increase in the rate
°f excise gives an advantage in profit margin to
brands with lower weights.
There is an alternative escape route, to erode
the weight of tobacco and the quality of the cigar-
ette, but we have steadfastly refused to do this.
Our reputation for quality is our fundamental
strength.
An increase in excise can also create con-
sumer resistance to the higher prices, so that, at
least for a time, smokers will turn to cheaper
products. In each of the last two years, we found
a downturn immediately after the Budget in-
creases, followed by a gradual upswing as the
public re-asserted its desire for quality. Because
of this, we are now aiming to entrench ourselves
in the cheaper market as an insulation against this
situation in the future.
We are of the opinion that the Commonwealth
Government should re-examine the system -of
excise, and its effects. Certainly, the system should
not create unwarranted advantages and disadvan-
tages as between one manufacturer and another.
I turn now to the year ahead of us. Despite
predictions in the Commonwealth Budget, there
is no sign yet of any surge in the economy, but
there are hopeful signs that rural incomes may
take a turn for the better and of some slight
growth in secondary industry. An uplift in the
general level of economic activity will be of advan-
tage to your Company.
We have taken bold steps and set a hot pace
to retrieve our previous share of the market, and
we have further moves prepared ready for action.
Despite the vigorous competition, we appear at
this point to have made some progress, and if this
continues, our story this time next year should be
pleasing in terms of sales and profits.
I stress that there is no easy road to success,
and we know from past experience how it some-
times takes more than a year for well-conceived
brands to become fruitful. But, as stockholders,
you can be confident that our organisation will be
doing its best to accelerate success.

MAN ON THE LAND
Why the Merino Ban Must Go
MYSTIC BELIEF in the superiority
of a breed of animal (or man)
usually ends in disappointment.
Everyone knows the Australian Merino
is the best sheep in the world for wool.
But will it retain its superiority? Most
people in this country, whether on the
land or off it, appear to assume that
it will, so it seems pertinent to point
out one or two facts which could lead
to a different conclusion.
We have tremendous admiration for
the breeders of the past, and present,
who have devoted themselves to what
must be often a lonely and expensive
vocation. We are very well aware that
some breeders recognise the dangers of
complacency.
Maintaining a breed is just as diffi-
cult, maybe more difficult, than im-
proving a breed. Yet in maintenance,
rather than improvement, may lie de-
feat.
History shows us clearly that the
greatest improvement in a breed in-
variably takes place in an era during
which economic conditions permit a
good profit to be made the bigger
the profit the faster the rate of im-
provement. But the harsh fact is that
the profit in breeding is now not par-
ticularly encouraging. Breeders have
therefore tended to follow the only
course open to them. The stud register
has been closed since 1921 and in the
past few months moves have taken
place to close the circle even tighter.
It may well be that from now on
the only people permitted to breed
■ stud Merino sheep will be those who
already maintain studs or those ap-
proved by them. This is understandable,
because the breeder cannot control the
ever-mounting costs and wages spiral
and all that goes with it —inflated land
values, probate, land taxes, and so on.
But it is not good. It may stave off,
but only temporarily, the inevitable
decline.
This is the same procedure as
adopted by Spain at the time of Philip
11. As the original owners of the
“Ovegas Merino” (the wandering
sheep) the Spanish believed that no
one else could ever produce their
equal. But it happened. The electors
of Saxony, in what is now Germany,
managed to produce even better
Merinos. They, too, believed they
would never have rivals.
John Macarthur, with help from Sir
Joseph Banks and others, laid the foun-
dations of the Australian sheep industry,
which is a Merino industry, and which
became in a relatively short period the
world leader. We should not forget,
but often do, how rapidly the Austra-
lian sheep industry progressed. Mac-
arthur sent his first bale to England in
1808. By 1860, only 50 years later, the
industry was well established. By 1880
it was no longer necessary to import
sheep for breeding purposes —the Ver-
monts from America imported by Sir
Samuel McCaughey and others at that
time were the last importations, and
there has always been argument over
whether these particular importations
were a good thing or not.
B Y the 1900 s the Peppin Riverina
type Merino (the dominant influ-
ence thereafter) had been well estab-
lished, and about 20 years later the
register was closed and export of the
Australian Merino prohibited by law.
Ever since the ban on the export of
Merinos was brought in there has been
argument against it. The point today,
in 1966, is that removal of the ban at
this stage may not be as meaningful as
those who chafe under it imagine. It is
commonly believed that removal of the
ban would see a tremendous rush of
buyers to Australian sales. What we
may be forgetting is that other people
have not been sitting still. For instance,
it is now 40 years since South American
breeders have been denied access
(officially) tQ Australian blood. It i s
highly likely that there has always been
some smuggling, but, nevertheless, large-
scale purchases have been prevented.
The 40 years since 1926, when the ban
was imposed, may correspond in South
America to the great period of experi-
mentation in Australia between, say.

iB6O and 1900. South America could,
at this stage, be only about 20 to 30
years away from a fine wool sheep
equal, if not superior, to the Australian
Merino.
Whatever the surmise, the fact is
that Britain this year doubled her pur-
chases of South American (mainly
Argentine) wool, whereas her Austra-
lian purchases dropped remarkably.
Ten years ago Britain bought 25 per-
cent of all Australian wool. In 1965-66
she took only ten percent of our clip.
South American wool is not as good,
yet, as Australian wool, but it is
cheaper. South America has today what
Australia had 40 years ago (and has
NOT today)—large land area and
comparatively low costs.
South American nations do not belong
to the International Wool Secretariat.
The IWS has been trying hard to get
them in. The reason they do not come
in, according to the IWS, is “tradi-
tional suspicion and political insta-
bility.” For a politically unstable con-
tinent they have done rather well for
themselves in keeping out of two world
wars this century and a dozen flare-ups
since World War 11. If their wool-
marketing methods are “chaotic” it
does not seem to frighten buyers
away. The real reason South American
countries stay out of the IWS could
well be that it suits them. They will
give every kind of support to the IWS
except the support that really matters
—putting up money.
JF they are denied Australian Merino
blood they can still obtain Merino-
type stock from many parts of the world
to work on. There are still Vermonts in
U.S.A., Rambouillets in France, and,
presumably, sheep in Spain. The Aus-
tralian Merino was created from a
strange and varied mixture. Into it
went blood from Spain, Saxony, other
parts of Germany and Austria, the
Cape, Silesia, and England. The Cor-
riedale, exported in great numbers to
South America, is in some respects a
part-Merino sheep. Too much, in any
case, can be made today of breed
characteristics. Advances in wool manu-
facturing technology compensate for
shortcomings which 40 years ago would
have been insurmountable.
The IWS will doubtless keep trying
to get the South American countries
to contribute, and doubtless they will
find all kinds of reasons for putting the
day of payment off.
There will be increased demands in
Australia for lifting the Merino export
ban, and this may come about. But
anyone who imagines that merely lift-
ing the ban will revitalise Australian
breeding seems certain to be disap-
pointed.
Inevitably there will be plans for
e yen more massive taxpayer contribu-
tions to the wool industry by way of
grants and subsidies, yet the results to
date are hardly impressive.
Despite all the undoubted “break-
throughs” in scientific farming theory,
the harsh, unpalatable fact is that all
the millions of dollars expended since
the war have resulted in an approxi-

head, or an annual increase of less than
0.3 percent.
Economics tells the story: in the
grand days of the wool industry boom
(and bust) of last century they reckon-
ed on getting a return on capital of
between 17 and 25 percent per annum.
Today, any sheep property returning
more than three percent is a remark-
able one indeed Lit would be interest-
ing to know what they are getting in
South America, and the mere fact That
it is impossible to get a clear answer
suggests it is rather better than three
percent.
Considering the circumstances it is
perhaps only natural that caution, com-
. placency, and conservatism should pre-
vail in Australia.

AGRISEARCH
Attacking the Fruit Fly
WILY ways of controlling Queens-
land fruit flies are reaching
fruition. One approach aims at
swamping a district with laboratory-
reared, sterilised males. The other
uses certain odors to lure the flies to
their doom. Both methods have now
been tested successfully on a pilot scale
at several different centres in inland
New South Wales. People in univer-
sities, CSIRO, the N.S.W. Department
of Agriculture, the Atomic Energy
Commission, and private firms have
co-operatively devised and implemented
these programs. The Rural Credits
Development Fund of the Common-
wealth Reserve Bank provided most
of the financial support.
Both attempts depended for their
success on being applied against
isolated populations of the pest. How-
ever, it may be possible to use
them on a much wider scale in
future. The sterile-male method of
insect control was first invoked
by E. F. Knipling, of the United
States Department of Agricul-
ture. About ten years ago he used it
to eradicate the screw-worm, a fly-
strike pest of cattle equivalent to our
sheep blowfly, from Curacao, an island
in the Caribbean Sea. Subsequently,
this control technique has been applied
on the U.S. mainland, where the fly
occurs over a vast area. It is now
thoroughly suppressed in Florida and
over broad sections of the neighboring
States. This suggests that if an appro-
priately large attack was mounted here
the Queensland fruit fly could be
annihilated not merely in isolated
pockets but all along the coastal fringe
from Cairns to southern Victoria,
where the fly’s population is almost
continuous.
The Knipling method can work with
the fruit fly because the female usually
mates only once. The problem is,
therefore, to flood an area with a suf-
ficient number of sterile males so that
the chances of a female meeting a
fertile male in the natural population
is very low. If laboratory production
of sterile males can be maintained at
a high rate, a few successive releases
should suffice to cause the wild popula-
tion to fade out of existence com-
pletely. When the Sydney insectary for
raising fruit flies was working at peak
capacity it was turning out a million
sterile males a week. This number was
enough to saturate the local popula-
tions of the fly in the townships of
Warren and Trangie.
Between the end of winter and the
following March, over 12J million
sterile males were distributed in Warren
and nearly million in Trangie. To-
gether, these towns would not cover
more than about two square miles. This
gives some guide to the magnitude of
an operation needed to knock out the
fruit fly along extensive coastal belts.
The American campaign soaked up an
immense amount of money, organisa-
tional skill, and trained personnel, but
was tremendously profitable, neverthe-
less. Our greatest difficulty here prob-
ably would be in getting enough
money and skill together to launch a
big enough assault to clear an economic
and strategically important fruit-
growing area.
PROFESSOR H. G. Andrewartha,
University of Adelaide, and Profes-
sor L. C. Birch, University of Sydney,
guided the attacks on Warren and
Trangie. The fruit-fly population at
Trangie was naturally isolated, but rein-
forcements from surrounding infested
areas could fly into Warren. Not a
single maggoty fruit was found in
Trangie during the campaign, and in
Warren only a few appeared on the
outskirts of town toward the end of the
season. These probably resulted from a
few females that had been fertilised
outside the area and immigrated into it.
The flies were sterilised by exposure
to a carefully measured dose of nuclear
radiation at a precise stage of their
growth—on the eighth day of pupal
life, to be exact.
The other tactic of using lures is,
however, because of the cost factor,
likely to become a routine control prac-

tice sooner. The idea of enticing pests
into traps is as old as pests themselves,
but getting it to work with insects has
generally failed until quite recently.
Once again the Americans have pro-
vided several totally successful ex-
amples, and the world’s entomologists
are closely watching other experiments
currently being conducted by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
Three years ago, using a lure
method, the USDA eradicated the
oriental fruit fly from Rota, a 35-
square-mile island of the Mariana
group in the western Pacific. The cost
of this operation worked out at a mere
50 cents per acre. The lure: methyl-
eugenol, and a fast-acting insecticide
were absorbed on to strong paper discs,
which were then distributed from an
aircraft. Earlier, an invasion of
Florida by the Mediterranean fruit fly
was knocked out similarly by means of
a different lure, and yet other lures
are being used against the Mexican
fruit fly in California and the gipsy
moth in the north-eastern States.
The important thing about these
lures is that they are fairly specific,
i.e., their attractiveness is confined as
a rule to only one species of insect.
Moreover, the method avoids the need
for repeated, widespread spraying with
chemicals, which often leave toxic
residues on food and kill good animals
along with the bad. Nor does the
method involve the risk of provoking
immune reactions among pest popula-
tions, which leads to the formulation of
ever more poisonous sprays.
The Australian excursion into this
sophisticated field has not proved to be
an immediate, unqualified success, but
its results are very encouraging, none-
theless. Two lures were found for the
Queensland fruit fly. One made by ICI
consists of partially digested casein and
linseed, and attracts, quite strongly,
both the males and the females. The
other, a pure although complex chem-
ical, interests only the males of the
species.
Twelve isolated towns in central and
north-central N.S.W. were chosen for
the experiment. Either one or other of
the lures or both were distributed
throughout nine of the towns, while the
remaining three were left untreated as
comparisons. The lures plus insecticide
(malathion) were absorbed on small
pieces of “Caneite” which were nailed
to fences, trees, etc., in a regular
pattern.
THE experiment ran for two years.
First-year results were quite dis-
appointing, although the towns in
which both lures had been spread were
not seriously plagued by the fruit fly.
The following year all lures worked
much more effectively. Fly-damaged
fruit was very rare in the towns baited
with the double lure. In one, for in-
stance, only one infested fruit was
found during the entire season. In
contrast, up to half the fruit in the
untreated towns contained the fly’s
maggots.
Further studies are in progress which
aim to elucidate a system of practical,
large-scale control. Commercial fruit-
growers, backyarders, and travellers
pestered by inspectors at road-blocks
throughout the eastern States will be
eagerly awaiting the developments.

SPECULATORS DIARY
Higher pay, shorter hours
Company directors of the world, unite
FRIDAY, September 30, was annual meeting day. Why so many companies
selected this day would require some specific research. Perhaps it was because
it was the last day in the first quarter of the new year. Or perhaps it was the
following long weekend (in N.S.W.) that encouraged directors to parade them-
selves before getting away from it all.
Obviously unable to attend all of
them, I settled on one — Fire Fighting.
Expecting more directors than share-
holders, I was surprised to find it was
difficult to get a seat when I arrived
ten minutes late. Apart from a reason-
ably full and informative address by
the chairman, the most interesting part
of the meeting was the discussion on
the proposed increase in the directors’
fees. One shareholder reckoned that
£5O a directors’ meeting (note the use
of the old currency) was enough for
anyone. Another, who immediateily de-
clared himself a liberal, launched out
about the injustice of rising costs for
the man on the land. And so it went
on.
This business of directors’ fees (and
for that matter retiring allowances)
for directors is an old perennial. My
view is that provided it bears some re-
lation to the success of the business
(preferably measured in terms of profit-
ability), and also to the size of opera-
tions, then apparently exorbitant fees
are generally justified.
In most cases an outsider is simply
not qualified to pass judgment on a
fair amount for fees. An exception
would appear to be Petroleum Invest-
ments. With an investment portfolio
having a current value of only $300,000,
or $200,000 less than the capital origi-
nally subscribed, and with a fee already
being paid to an investment consultant
to manage it, I’m surprised that direc-
tors still can feel they are entitled to
$2OOO a year.
£jOME cynics would favor the forfeit-
ure of directors’ fees when a com-
pany makes a loss. If such a rule were
imposed, the directors of Toft Bros,
would not be too happy. Despite an
auspicious beginning in October, 1965,
when the company was first listed, a
loss of $17,000 for the full 65/66 year
has just been announced. Even though
weather conditions were poor, the 14
percent fall in sales of sugarcane har-
vesting and loading equipment is in
stark contrast to the huge expansion
scheme in the sugar industry com-
menced in 1964.
A vivid illustration of the effect of
this shock result was the immediate
fall in share price from 70c to 35c. Bad
as the news may be, this slashing of
the price seems too extreme. I bought
500 shares at an average price of 3/ c
These days it seems that I rarely
deal in shares other than those below
par or those in the mining industry.
After an absence of only one week
L. J. Hooker is back in the portfolio!
So far the shares have behaved in a
most satisfying way. In at 32c to catch
the run up to 39c. Just managed to ex-
tract myself at this price before the
reaction took the shares back to 35c.
Now I hope to see them rise above 40c.
For the final purchase of the week
I swung over to the West: In Perth
Passiona Bottling Co. (Perth) Ltd. has
been proving that the soft drink business
can be as lucrative as a similar business
in the eastern States. Also now that
General Foods has started the ball roll-
ing with the takeover of Cottees it
seems that Passiona Bottling could be
in the takeover path. Even ignoring this,
the dividend yield of 4.4 percent is
reasonably attractive for a genuine
growth proposition. My order for 200
shares was executed at $l.BO.
A busy week in selling. With the rise
in Peko Wallsend to $2.43 and with the
dividend thrown in, I managed to clear
the stock without loss. Steel Mills at
80c gave me a $24 profit. A smaller
but very much quicker profit of $l4
was shown on the Associated Securities
rights.
Transactions this week were:

600 Peko Wallsend 2.45 $1462
500 Steel Mills .80 $392
