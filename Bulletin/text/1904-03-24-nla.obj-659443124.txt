leonainie.
Leonainie —Angels named her,
And they took the light
Of the laughing stars and framed her
In a smile of white ;
And they made her hair of gloomy
Midnight, and her eyes of bloomy
Moonshine, and they brought her to me
In the solemn night —
In a solemn night of summer.
When my heart of gloom
Blossomed up to greet the comer,
Like a rose in bloom ;
All forebodings that distressed me
I forgot as Joy caressed me—
Lying Joy ! that caught and pressed me
In the arms of doom.
Only spake the little lisper
In the angel-tongue;
Yet I, listening, heard her whisper—
• • Songs are only sung
Mere below that they may grieve you—
Tales but told you to deceive you—
So must Leonainie leave you
While her love is young.”
Then God smiled and it was morning,
Matchless and supreme ;
Heaven’s glory seemed adorning
Earth with its esteem.
Every voice but mine seemed gifted
With the voice of prayer, and lifted
Where my Leonainie drifted
From me like a dream.

That only walk by day.

A. M. Fairbairn’s somewhat depreciatory article < in Her-

criticism- ‘‘Spencer had not a speculative genius, pro-

Genius for generalisation and a power of expressing

SCALP AND HAIR
Something for Mothers to Think About
EVERY CHILD born into the world with an inherited
of early developed tendency to distressing* disfiguring
humours of the skin* scalp* and blood* becomes an object
of the most tender solicitude* not only because of its suf-
fering but because of the dreadful fear that the disfigura-
tion is to be lifelong and mar its future happiness and
prosperity. Hence it becomes the duty of mothers csf
such afflicted children to acquaint themselves with the
best* the purest* and most effective treatment available*
viz., THE CUTICURA TREATMENT.
Warm baths with Cuticura Soap, to cleanse the skin of crusts and scale 3
and soften the thickened cuticle, gentle anointings with Cuticura Oint-
ment, to instantly allay itching, irritation, and inflammation, and soothe and
heal, to be followed in the severer cases by mild doses of Cuticura Resol-
vent Pills (see below), to cool and cleanse the blood, are all that can be
desired for the alleviation of the suffering of skin-tortured infants and
children and the comfort of worn-out, worried mothers. A single set 13
often sufficient to cure when the best physicians fail.
Millions of Women Use Cuticura Soap
Assisted by Cuticura Ointment, for preserving, purifying, and beautifying the skin, for
cleansing the scalp of crusts, scales, and dandruff, and the stopping of falling hair, for
softening, whitening, and soothing red, rough, and sore hands, for baby rashes, itchings,
andchaflngs, in the form of baths for annoying irritations and inflammations, or too freo
or offensive perspiration, in the form of washes for ulcerative weaknesses, and for many
sanative, antiseptic purposes which readily suggest themselves to women, especially
mothers, and for all the purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery.
CunoußA Resolvent Pills (Chocolate Coated) are prepared to meet the wants of
delicate women, and sensitive children, and are pure, sweet, and tasteless. They . o
beyond question the most successful blood purifiers and humour cures yet compounded.

Various Verses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Gloaming Hours.
Oat on the harbor, across the dusky bay,
With nothing but the far, faint stars above ;
Surely when love wills it we can always find a
way,
For the wisdom of all wisdom is in love.
Twilight, and shadows, and wonderment of
dreaming,
Soft hands and brown hands in the dark unseen,
Far across the golden lights are vaguely, dimly
gleaming,
With a waste of whispering waters in between.
Soft sways the drifting boat; the tide is on the turn,
You two are very silent in the stern.
Drifting with the lazy ebb, sheltered by the
shore,
Faint comes the music of the distant ferry band.
Surely such a night as this was never known
before
In the gloaming by the shadow of the land.
Through the hills a night bird’s cry from a far
lagoon,
Wailing down amongst the whispering trees,
While close at hand the hidden reef in lazy,
sleepy croon
Swings the silent night-waves sleeping on her
knees.
Space and kindly darkness, and a ripple ’neath the
prow,
“ What are you two whispering softly in the boiv f ”
Now the moon between the Heads strews her
petals down,
In our wake the silver lightnings play ,•
Swiftly and silently we leave the gleaming
town
For the warm and dusky shadows of the bay.
In the years that are to be, when the nights are
old,
Will this love of ours—this dream-love—last?
Or, when the fires are dying to the ashes grey and
cold,
Will it fade to but a memory of the past ?
The tide turns, the moon wanes, blaze the stars
above.
Bow and stern are dreaming fancies lorn of love.
N.s.w.
CARO.
A Pagan Hymn.
I am weary of dawn and sunset, I am weary of
night and day ;
But God is God, .and the soul shall live, though
the body may pass away.
All that is fair is fleeting, the sin of all sins is
birth,
For the Lord who has doomed us to Heaven is
King and Priest of the Earth.
Why should the soul be tor! ured with the dread
of eternal life ?
Oh ! if the soul were ashes we might end for ever
the strife.
I have led the life, I am weary, I have rioted
with the throng
And worn the crown of triumph and woven the
garlands of song. 7
The raptures of sin have played me their scarlet-
and-gold symphony—
Of women and roses and wine, and stars and the
foam of the sea.
I have watched the glitter of swords and seen
them flash in the sun—
That is the joy of living, but life is all famislud
and done.
But the world is a drifting shadow that mooks as
it fades away,
And Time itself grows weary, and stars glow
haggard and grey.
At noontide the garden rejoices, and the sun is as
gold on the lawn.
But the swords are rusted, the roses fade, and the
women are pale in the dawn.
I am weary of strife, of heaven and earth, of the
passions that hold us in thrall,
And I pray that the soul may be only dust—to
forget is the best of all.

The skein is snapped,
And the hand is still;
She will spin no more
By the window sill.
’Twas a poor design
And a paltry task ;
Could a common soul
For a better ask?
It was all her own,
And 'twas large enough.
Her own small life
With the smootli and rough.
But even that
In the middle broke,
And she spun no more
Nor sighed nor spoke.
It is incomplete,
And it lies awry,
But none may finish it,
You nor I.
’Twas a poor design,
And it lies half-spun,
And none can guess
Why ’twas e’er begun.
Ah, the skein is snapped
And the hand is still,
She will spin no more
By the window sill.

A Lesson Worth Learning.
Hsepatitis and Dyspeptic Misery.
“A BLESSING TO WORK & LIVE.”
The Case of
Mrs. B. EAGAR.
(For the Eedfem Times.)
It is impossible to read the following
statement of the condition of things de-
scribed by Mrs. Bertha Eagar, of No. 145
Walker-street, Redfern, without being
struck by certain phases and facts in her re-
cital. Carrying her memory back eleven
years, Mrs. Eagar said :
“ It is that length of time since I was re-
leased from a complaint of such great ob-
stinacy that there was every reason to think
I would never be the same woman again.
Why I say this is because my sufferings ex-
tended over a period of six months or
more, and half that time I was under the
care of a doctor.”
“ What complaint was he treating you
for?” asked our reporter.
“ My ailments were as numerous as they
were difficult to cope with, but I am of
opinion that they were occasioned by a dis-
eased state of my liver. Be that as it may,
I know that indigestion was one of the prin-
cipal features of my illness, and I became so
serio sly affected by it that before long I
was a completely helpless invalid. When I
had been taking medicines prescribed by my
physician till I knew it was useless to drink
any more I did not know what to do next,
for I was so feeble that I could not walk
across the floor It seemed a cruel thing to
throw so much money away, and waste so
much time for nothing, but when people are
ill, you know, they will spend their last
penny, if necessary, in buying things which
they expect to do them good. And that is
the very reason why I consider it my duty
to divulge to all mankind the fact that it
was only through using Clements Tonic at
the eleventh hour that my awful sufferings
were checked. Through reading a kindly-
disposed person’s testimonial I started tak-
ing it, and ever since those words appeared
before me I have regarded them with as
much respect as though they had consti-
tuted a message from an angel above. When
I come to consider how much agony I en-
dured I am devoutly thankful that the right
remedy came at last.”
“Was it after eating that you felt so
ill ? ”
“ Well, if you like to call it eating, it
was, but my appetite was so very quickly
appeased that I could not take even a
moderate meal. Two or three mouthfuls of
light diet we e always enough, and then the
most unmerciful pains in the chest started.
Had you beheld my anguish you would have
been moved, as the suffocating sensations in-
duced such desperate efforts to get my
breath that an onlooker would have feared
I was going to choke. A fearful state of
weakness was brought about, and I was
compelled to lie down the greater part of
the day, my household duties, of course,
being out of the question so far as I was
concerned. A dreadful aching pain settled
across my brow, as if its mission was to
destroy all the pleasures in life, and it cer-
tainly succeeded, for I felt cheerless and
careworn beyond expression. This state of
things was bad enough in the day time, but
when I hid to go through the same horrors
*t night, for the want of sleep, my sorrowful
condition can be imagined. Gradually the
tlesh wasted off my bones, and in the mean-
‘iine my skin changed to a pallid hue, while
the weaker I got the more my limbs ached.
My lips and hands were as white as if my
'l"°d had turned to water, and when I
•aised my head I became quite giddy. If I
tried to walk upstairs I felt so dazed that I
ould not go two steps alone, a strange mist
•Iso appearing before my eyes, which nearly
I ways felt swollen and weak, as if I were
tillering from a severe cold. Acute pains
truck me between my shoulder-blades, too,
while the aches across my loins were as pain-
ful as they could be. My mouth was never
free from a taste as bitter as gall, and there
was a sticky substance over my tongue
which I could never wash off, these two ad-
verse elements combined making me con-
tinually feel sick.”
“How did your nervous system bear up
against all this ? ”
“ Very well for a time, and then my
nerves gave way quite suddenly. The least
excitement produced a fit of trembling, my
mind also being agitated on the slightest
provocation. But, so far as that goes, my
brain always seemed to be in a restless state,
for if I got an hour or two’s doze, it in-
variably meant that I had some kind of ugly
dream, the recollection of which frightened
me on awaking.”
“ You certainly had very little comfort in
life at that time, Mrs. Eagar.”
“ There was really nothing left for me to
live for, and the melancholy thoughts with
which I was seized through my heart pal-
pitating very badly made me heartily sick
and tired of everything ; but when I read
about Clements Tonic I thought I might at
least get a little better if I tried it, and I
think my present appearance speaks for it-
self. When my recovery began it was by
acquiring an appetite through the use of
Clements Tonic, and already that medicine
had done me more service than all the other
decoctions put together, because there was
an inward sense of comfort after my food
which told me that digestion was being pro-
perly performed. Ido not wish you to be-
lieve that this wonderful amount of relief
came instantly, because such a thing, con-
sidering the plight I was in, would be im-
possible, but it was certainly the speedy and
direct result of taking Clements Tonic, and,
moreover, I was soon sufficiently eased from
headaches and pains to admit of sound
sleep helping me towards the goal I desired
to reach. The medicine I was taking suited
my complaints splendidly, as the fearful
pains in my chest diminished as each dose
of Clements Tonic was taken, while flatu-
lence and giddiness were remedied quite
mysteriously. Drowsiness and despondency
were wafted away by the medicine, which
was likewise bracing together my shattered
nerves, and its regulating powers had a
beneficial effect which I have enjoyed up to
the present day. My skin soon became
clear and bright, which showed that
Clements Tonic had a more powerful in-
fluence over my blood than any physic I had
hitherto purchased, and the unpleasant taste
was altogether removed from my mouth. It
did not take a great deal of Clements Tonic
to rid me of those wearying aches which had
come upon me through excessive weakness,
and when they were gone there was nothing
to stop me from doing my housework with
as much activity and cheerfulness as ever.
Indeed, it was a blessing to work and live,
for before my last bottle of Clements Tonic
was finished I was well and sound in every
respect, and not one of my old ailments has
troubled me since. A lesson like mine
should be taught all invalids, so you can
publish these words in any way you
choose.”

Songs of the Sea.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tramp Steamers.
The ships still bear to the sea, and wave by wave
The wide, green waste enfolds its cradled dead;
In wrath and spray the wind-gusts shriek and rave,
And careless surges toss the heedless head ;
With sightless eyes and cold, white face and pallid
lips
They drift, the human debris of the old lost ships.
The ships still bear to the sea; by day, by night
Is played the game of death, and one by one
Pass those who lose, out quickly from the fight,
To take the other prize which they have won ;
And all, at times, have fought and looked death
in the eyes,
Who tramp the world in ships in search of mer-
chandise.
The ships still bear to the sea, and still the dead,
A tribute to the greedy surge, are paid ;
Fabric and fragment, spar and tattered shred,
And white, bleaefited bones of sailormen are stayed.
There, in the salt sea slime, they lie, in the
lambent gloom,
In a boundless, restless, unmarked, ever-shifting
tomb.
The ships b§ar back from the sea, and, heat or
cold,
Dim dawn, or blazing noon, or setting sun,
Storm-wrack or calm, the sailormen—grey and
old—
Laugh as men laugh whose dreary toil is done.
And the great sea goeth to and fro upon its stones,
Shapening with tireless hands a shelf to hold
their bones.

EDGAR HEANE HARRIS.
The Barrier Isles.
When winds o’ June were cool and fair
We launched our boat—we waved adieu ;
We sped to tropic sea-ways, where
The waters melt in changing hue;
We sped where proud Pacific’s blue
Is stoutly pent for myriad miles
By coral bulwarks rooted true,
In seas that lap the Barrier Isles.
And lonely peaks the pine that bear
Looked o’er the land—a warder-crew—
And seemed to warn her well: “ Beware
The foe that breaks the Barrier through ;
As we uprise from ocean blue
And pen his wrath with sea-girt piles,
See you—ye hold you steadfast, too,
In seas that lap the Barrier Isles ! ”
At night the soft and moon-lit air
Would throb and throb—as on we drew —
With starry song, divine and rare,
That rose and fell and rose anew ;
And deep within the sapphire grew
A wondrous growth of coral wiles
Where strange sea-ereatures flashed and flew
In seas that lap the Barrier Isles.
Nay—tell me not of sea-wolf’s lair,
Of skies whose Boreal flash beguiles,
How may their frozen charms compare
With seas that lap the Barrier Isles !
Q.
P.L.
The Outer Sea.
Ghostly mystic whisperings are sounding on the
breeze,
Murmuring of the loves of other years ;
Cadence low and mournful, sighing through the
trees,
Harmony of sorrow and of tears.
The past must be forgotten and hopes more firmly
set —
The hopes that promise bright futurity
Other hearts will love us, for love is living yet;
And so our thoughts must seek the Outer Sea.
Vast expanse of water, shimmering in the noon,
Reaching to a sky-line dim and far ;
Shattering waves and misty, as the breezes croon,
Break on beaches where our futures are.
And the ocean’s music, sung with every tide,
Does it tell of happiness to be ?
Hope is in our heart of hearts, and so we slowly
glide
From this world and towards the Outer Sea.
Where the rollers rise and fall, sparkling in the
light
With the jewelled splendor of the sun ;
Corals capped of pearly foam, gilded, hued, and
bright,
Shining like the night stars, one by one.
Where the air is calm and fragrant, in a haze of
silver sheen
Fraught of happy fancied visionry,
There I hasten when I think on what I might
have been,
And, soul aweary, seek the Outer Sea.

Certain Tory Doctors and the N.S.W.
Birth-rate.
The Bulletin makes no apology for returning to
the subject of the N.S.W. Birth-rate Commission,
already alluded to in last week’s issue. The
subject is one of great importance ; the need to
find a remedy for the trouble —although the
trouble is not yet so bad as is generally supposed
—is also very great; and the Birth-rate Com-
mission shamefully misused its temporary power
to divert attention from the real source of the
evil, to indirectly lay the blame on a class which
it must have known —if it was even threatened
with intelligence—was the one least responsible,
and, apparently, to betray its trust and sacri-
fice truth and honesty for the gratification
of a sordid, squalid personal spite. Cer-
tain medical men of the most hopelessly Tory
character are understood to have been the moving
spirits of the Commission, and they are generally
held to be mainly responsible for the silly lie-
bv-implication, that Trades-Unionism and Labor
legislation caused, or must shortly cause, a decline
in the arriving Cornstalk infant. To use the
Commissioners’ own words: —
Legislative regulation of the conditions of employment
has not as yet, so far as can be traced by statistics, had
any tangible influence on the birth-rate,’ but we cannot
overlook the fact that restrictive regulations of trade,
designed to abolish competition, effectually interfere with
the continuity of employment in many walks of life, so
that the income of those employed is more or less pre-
carious, and this cannot fail to indirectly discourage the
existence of large families and the natural increase of
population which would ensue therefrom.
This is the statement which The Bulletin
characterises as a lie—a silly, childish lie un-
worthy of any grown-up oitizen of alleged in-
telligence.
* * * *
The class affected by Labor legislation and
trades-unionism (barring shearers, who form a
thin scattering of population all over the country)
is confined mostly to the workmen’s districts of
Sydney and to a few mining towns outside. The
published information in the official annual,
“ Vital Statistics of N.5.W.,” as to the birth-rates
of these separate districts is somewhat scanty,
except as regards Sydney. Newcastle, Lithgow,
&c., were, in the earlier reports, mostly lumped
in with adjacent districts. Even as regards the
separate birth-rates of separate districts of Sydney
the information only covers a very few years.
Still, it is interesting and most instructive. In
the following table, in order to save decimals, the
number of births is given as compared with every
100,000 inhabitants; the fact that none of these
suburbs has 100,000 inhabitants makes no diffe-
rence in the relative proportion of things :

These statistics cover the whole metropolitan area.
They are hardly so comprehensive as they might
be (statistics seldom are) yet they demonstrate
several things:—
(1) That in every case the working-man’s quarter—the
one where the population is most directly affected by
trades-unionism and Labor legislation—shows a far larger
birth-rate than the fashionable quarters where the old
Tory doctors of the Birth-rate Commission and their
friends reside. Also it, in every case save one, shows a
birth-rate above the general average of N.S. W.
(2) That in the artisans' quarters, where live the people
directly affected by trades-unionism and Labor legisla-
tion, the birth-rate shows its largest increase.
(3) That the only places in the metropolitan
region which show a decrease are the affluent district
to which Randwick belongs, and which also includes
Vaucluse, Bondi, and Woollahra; and the city itself,
where are the great horde of Macquarie-street doctors,
the Governor, the people who live at the Australia Hotel,
and the denizens of Potts Point. These are also the
districts where the rate is below the N.S.W. average.
(4) But for the falling away of the birth-rate in these
regions and in the agricultural districts of the country,
where trades-unionism is unknown, the birth-rate, appa-
rently, wouldn’t be decreasing.
• • * *
Drs. Mackellar and MaoLaubin and their
fellow Tories on the Birth-rate Commission
undoubtedly held a brief for the rich, and
apparently they were resolved to drag in a curse
at trades-unionism and at Labor legislation
by the hair of the head if it couldn’t be
dragged in otherwise. There are many
causes of the declining birth-rate—too many
to enumerate. One is the wholesale prac-
tising of abortion by very many members of
the allegedly honorable profession of medicine
—the profession to which Drs. Mackellar,
MacLaurin and Foreman belong. Another is
the fact that dignified and respectable papers
which cordially approve of the whole doctrine of
Toryism, and enthuse over the views which the
above-mentioned gentlemen hold, constantly ad-
vertise the means of procuring abortion. Behind
this there is the persistent disinclination towards
child-bearing of tne rich Tory class—the class which
can afford to rear children, the class to which Drs.
Mackellar and MacLaurin and their friends
are attached —as evidenced by the miserably low
birth-rate in their suburbs as compared with the
suburbs inhabited by trades-unionists and Labor
members and such-like patriotic characters. (The
exceedingly low birth-rate in the families of
medical men is also a consideration.) Then there
is the habit, among the wealthy class which holds
the same political views as Drs. MacLaurin and
Mackellar, of leading a lazy, loafing existence
in hotels, where children are objected to.
There i» the objection of the Tory landlord
of the MacLaurin and Mackellar political
class to let his houses to people with
children. There is also his insistence that his
house-servant, flunkey, groom, coachman, boun-
dary-rider, station-hand, married couple, &c.,
must be “ without encumbrance” —that they must
have had no children, or that, if they had them
and the children didn’t die naturally, they must
have killed them or otherwise got rid of them. No
one ever heard of a trades-union carpenter or
bricklayer performing operations to bring about
abortion, or running a paper which advertised
abortionists, or demanding that his flunkey should
be without encumbrance, or sacrificing the pro-
spect of rearing a family because the possession of
young children would make it inconvenient for
him to live at the Hotel Australia. All these sins
against the birth-rate belong exclusively to the
rich Tory class for which the rich Tory medicos
of the Birth-rate Commission held a brief, and
to pander to whose prejudices they so grossly
misued their little patch of brief authority.
* • * *
When the latest complete N.S.W. statistics
(those for 1902) were published they showed a
birth-rate for the whole State of 2715 new infants
per annum to each 100,000 inhabitants. The
metropolitan district, as a whole, showed an
increase as compared with 1900; the country
a decrease. Around Sydney the exclusively
working-man group of suburbs which com-
prises Newtown, Camperdown, Erskirieville, and
St. Peters had a birth-rate at the proportion
of 2965 per 100,000 people—2so above the average.
The exclusively working-man’s group comprising
Redfern, Darlington, the two Botanys, Waterloo,
and Alexandria showed 2815—100 above the
average. The comparatively elegant and
wealthy group comprising Vaucluse, Woollahra,
Waverley, Randwick and Paddington showed
2240—n0 less than 475 below the average. And
if it hadn’t been that reasonably democratic
Paddington was lumped in with the four rich
Tory suburbs things would have been vastly
worse; the exceedingly high-toned district of
Vaucluse, for instance, had a birth-rate in the
proportion of 1650 per 100,000, or 1065 below the
average; while exceedingly gorgeous Randwick,
when taken by itself instead of being grouped
with the workmen’s quarters of Paddington, only
registered in 1902 at the rate of 1733 new infants
for 100,000 people, or 982 below the State’s aver-
age. The position may be more clearly under-
stood by a further table of figures which shows the
birth-rate for 1902 of one or two purely aristocratic
districts as compared with those of some towns
and districts inhabited almost entirely by work-
men of the trades-union brand (in the case of the
country towns the comparative figures for 1900
are not in the writer’s hands, so it is impossible
to show whether things are getting better or
worse): —

The list of districts occupied by the rich which
show a birth-rate below the N.S.W. average
might be extended indefinitely—they are all below
the average. So might the list of workmen’s
districts; they are almost all above the average,
and two of them (Newcastle and Lithgow) hold the
State record. But there are no such results as
those of Lithgow and Newcastle in agricultural
towns. In Bathurst, for instance, where there is
practically no trades-unionism and no trades
affected by Labor legislation—Bathurst, the centre
of a district of tenant farmers, crushed by the
exactions and misrule of Tories of the poli-
tical clan of Mackellar and Mac Laurin —the
births are at the rate of only 2462 per 100,000 —
far less than in the stifling bye-streets of Redfern.
Maitland, agricultural, rich, and free from trades-
unionism and trades affected by Labor legislation,
is even worse—its shocking birth record is 231 o
per 100,000; and Grafton (2655) and Wagga (2584)
are also below the average. Sydney, as a who e,
has a birth-rate that is below the average ot tne
whole State, but for that the rich and luxurious
parts of Sydney are wholly responsible.
* * * *
The fair inference is that the people who
are promoting and practising race suicide m
N.S.W. are the rich; that the people who,
wherever they control affairs, are forcing race-
suicide on others are the rich ; and that wher-
ever trades-unionism is strong, and wherever
the population is devoted to trades which come
within the range of such Labor legislation as
exists in N.S.W., the birth-rate is highest.
In such strongholds of Labor and trades-
unionism as Lithgow, Newcastle and Broken
Hill the rate is the same now as it was
for all N.S.W. a dozen years ago, and there
has been no decline worth mentioning. The
worker, even in the hopeless climate of the
Barrier, still does his duty to his country; the
luxurious dwellers of Randwick and Vaucluse have
almost left off doing theirs. In view of such
results the attempt of sundry rich and stodgy
Tories to profess that Labor legislation is respon-
sible, or shows signs of being responsible, for the
slackening of national growth is about the most
ghastly piece of effrontery —not to say mendacity
—the State has seen this generation.
The Navigation Bill.
The Freetrade press has greeted the Protectionist
Navigation Bill with the air of shocked surprise
that is usual to it whenever it is suggested that
the Australian is a reasoning, civilised being,
capable of making things and owning things, not
merely of hewing off wool and herding cattle for
more progressive people, and borrowing money to
keep his children in a sand-shifting job. It shocks
the Freetrade conscience to think that the Aus-
tralian should make boots and clothes and loco-
motives and run steamers. Far better, according
to that dismal economic faith, to do Gibeonite
jobs for Europe, and nourish a set of parasitic im-
porters to secure what of the higher things of civi-
lised life we can afford to buy out of the results of
* ‘natural industries. ” The proposed Protection to an
Australian shipping industry is, therefore, met with
hearty curses, and again the bogey is paraded of
the dreadful results any action to secure for A us-
tralians the Australian trade will have on the
foreigner. Yet if Australia commits itself to
Freetrade in shipping, it will be about the only
nation on earth—except Switzerland —having any
pretence to civilisation which is so foolish. Prac-
tically every European nation protects its ship-
ping interest. Britain for a while, after many
generations of Protection, attempted Freetrade
in shipping, but recently confessed the idea a
failure, and by an expensive system of subsidies
withstood the attempt of the American Shipping
Trust to monopolise a section of its carrying
trade. The United States, France, Germany,
Russia, Italy—all protect their shipping more or
less stringently. It is the usual thing for a
country to refuse its registration to a ship unless
the bulk of the crew and all the important
officers are of the nation’s citizenship; and to
refuse to any but locally-registered ships the right
of such trade as the nation can control. The
United States has a particularly effective, system
of shipping Protection. Unless a boat is regis-
tered in the U.S. she cannot carry passengers or
cargo from one U.S. port to another (under this
rule the Maoriland Union S.S. Co. had recently to
abandon its share in the American service, because
its Maoriland boats couldn’t trade between Hawaii
and San Francisco). To be registered in the U.S.
a vessel must be built in that country, must be
owned chiefly in that country, and must be manned
in great part by the citizens of that country. If
the owners of a vessel, after complying with all
these conditions, should spend any considerable
sum on repairs to the vessel in any foreign port—
unless in case of proved emergency—they forfeit
all rights under that registration. Thus Uncle
Sam seeks to make it certain that the benefits of
his trade shall be kept for his citizens.
* * * •
In other countries the shipping law is on very
much the same lines and, in addition, huge
subsidies are given from State funds to encourage
shipping enterprise. France and Germany are
said to pay such extensive subsidies to the vessels
which trade to Australia that they could almost
carry cargo for nothing and still not incur losses.
And, in Germany’s case at least, great precau-
tions are taken that the cargoes carried do
not come into competition with German
industries. The vessels may take what they
like to Australia; that is only keeping the
Australian workman out of a job; but they
may take nothing back which will com-
pete with the German artisan or farmer,
only raw products such as wool and
ores to keep German factories going. Britain
at one time carried its shipping Protection to
such excesses as to attempt to secure an absolute
monopoly of ocean-carrying. That attempt, in
spite of strong naval backing, failed, and then, in
Cobdenite zeal, Britain went to the other extreme
and tried Freetrade in shipping. But never quite
completely. Shipping still got subsidies for
postal and naval reserve services, and finally
Freetrade was confessed to be a failure as far as
the carrying industry was concerned when the
American Trust threatened the very existence of
Britain’s Atlantic fleet, and the British Govern-
ment responded with the subsidy to the Cunard
liners. Britain, however, whilst protecting and
subsidising shipowners, still neglects to protect
seamen, and, as a consequence, the Boy of the
Bulldog Breed is vanishing from the merchant
service, to be replaced by the nigger, the
Levantine, and the Scandinavian. That neglect
is not likely to continue long, as its effect
on navy recruiting is already being severely
felt, and the fact is beginning to dawn upon
British statesmen that it is useless to have a
gigantic navy without enough skilled men to
man it, and with no possibility of getting them,
even by resorting to the press gang. With the
outbreak of war Butta Singh, Trikopopulos,
and Olaf would be either useless for naval pur-
poses or unavailable, being needed in their own
countries. Thorough Protection to the shipping
industry or a crippling of the navy, that is the
alternative which Britain has to face; and the
choice is clearly indicated in the big strides
already made towards Protection. Yet, Aus-
tralia is urged by its Freetrade press to reject the
Navigation Bill, to stand by Freetrade in shipping,
and be the one lone Hatter among the nations in
this regard.
* * * *
The Bulletin finds fault with the Navigation
Bill, not for what it proposes, but for what it
shrinks from. A Navigation Bill, to meet the
requirements of the Commonwealth, should have
these as its vital clauses :
No vessel, unless registered in Australia, shall carry
passengers or cargo from one Australian port to another.
All vessels trading from one Australian port to another
must be manned, as to their crews, by three-fourths Aus-
tralian citizens ; as to their officers, exclusively by Aus-
tralian citizenß. All shipping employees to be included
in the benefits of the Arbitration Act.
After this Act has been in force five years no vessel not
already registered as Australian shall be so registered,
unless it has been entirely built in Australia.
Every Australian vessel of a suitable type shall be at
the disposal of the Australian Government for defence
purposes in war-time ; every Australian seaman shall be
trained as a naval reservist.
That would be a patriotic Bill, giving to ship-
owners and seamen adequate Protection, and
demanding from them in return service in defence
of Australia when needed. It would at the same
time create a ship building industry and an effec-
tive naval reserve. The Navigation Bill of the
Australian Government falls very far short of
that. It proposes—
Non-Australian ships must not carry cargo or passengers
from one Australian port to another unless they pay
Australian rates of wages as fixed by the Arbitration
Court, but makes the exception that Westralian ports are
not to be reckoned ; the law will stretch westward as far
as Adelaide, and no farther.
Owners of foreign ships (which are distinguished from
British ships) must obtain a license if they wish to
engage in coastal trade, and must give bonds that they
will observe Australian wage conditions, and must not
receive subsidies from foreign Governments. But in the
case of ships from countries which allow British ships
Freetrade conditions these provisions are relaxed, and
their ships are treated as British ships (it is not clear
whether this clause covers foreign ships which receive
subsidies hut come from countries which allow British
vessels an open field).
Thus the Bill boils down to a small Protection
to Australian shipowners by a provision that fair
wages must be paid to seamen on vessels trading
between Adelaide and Port Darwin, provided they
go by the eastern coast of Australia. Between
Adelaide and the last port on the western coast
the old cheap labor competition may continue. In
view of what might be proposed it is a very
inadequate Bill indeed. The idea of excluding
Westralia from the operations of the measure
is singularly paltry. If nigger-labor com-
petition is an unfair thing between Adelaide
and Melbourne it is just as unfair a thing
between Adelaide and Perth. The excuse
is that whilst Perth lacks railway communication
with the East this exception is necessary. But
that reason might be as well advanced on behalf
of Hobart or Cooktown. The fact seems to be
that in this matter the Westralian members
allowed considerations of their own convenience
to smother their principles, and had enough in-
fluence with the Labor party and the Government
to get their own way. As an instalment of
reform the Bill might be accepted, but a strenuous
effort should he made in committee to extend its
usefulness. The division of the Australian coast
into two parts, on one of which the seaman may
be sweated and the Australian shipowner driven
out by black labor competition, is absurd.
The distinction between foreign ships and
British ships is another anomaly. There
should be only two classes of ships and
those distinguished purely by economic con-
siderations —the ships which pay a fair Aus-
tralian rate of wages and those which do not.
It is useless, probably, to hope for a widening of
the scope of the Bill, so that it will protect the
Australian shipbuilder, the Australian shipowner,
the Australian sailor and Australian national
interests. But it might at least be improved to
declare for a fair Australian wage rate right round
the coast.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Prospects of Propsting.
The meeting of the Tasmanian Parliament this
month is a sorry gathering of ghosts, wasted
efforts, broken hopes, unpleasant recollections,
spooks, and derelicts. Sometime in the not very
long ago the Propsting Government came into
existence with a huge majority, a multitude of
rash promises, and a programme of reform. In
its first session the Upper House —the House of
Rich Landlords —laughed a metallic laugh and
crammed every one of its reform measures into
the waste-paper basket, and the whole Propsting
programme went to the dogs. The Government
had a large majority in the Assembly, and had
just been elected by a large majority at the polls.
As for the Upper House, its members mostly hold
their seats because, under the property qualifica-
tion, such a very few Tories are eligible to sit in
the* Council that it is seldom possible even to
Set up a contest. According to Launceston
Ixaminer, the last time the principal members
of Tasmania’s House of Landlords were elected
(the last time, that is, when they didn’t have a
walk over, and the last time when the people
weren’t simply forced to return them for lack of
any other candidate), and the number of persons
who voted at these last contested elections, were
as follows:

These aged relics, therefore, made no pretence of
having any recent mandate from the people, but
in their senile insolence they threw the whole
programme of the people’s Ministry into the
gutter all the same. Now Parliament re-assem-
bles with the same old programme, the same old
prospects, and a much older and less hopeful
Propsting. The old reform measures are to be
sent up again, and the papers which support
Propsting —seeing that no daily paper in Tas-
mania dares to suggest the use of strong measures
as regards the House of Lingering Remnants—
express a mild hope that the Dodery Chamber
will think better of it this time. At the same
time they know perfectly well that the Dodery
Chamber, drunk with wealth and arrogance, will do
nothing of the sort; it will just throw out the reform
measures all over again. As the warmest journal-
istic supporter of the Propsting Government re-
marks, “matters have now reached an acute stage,’
and it leaves things at that. It is announced by
papers that are in the Government’s confidence
that, if the Council again rejects all Propsting’s
measures, he will dissolve the Assembly —will
penalise the House that did its duty to influence
the House that didn’t. If Propsting is defeated
at the polls, through the people growing weary of
the whole purposeless business, he will resign. If
he is successful, he will come back strongly armed
a second time with the popular mandate—and the
Council will throw out all his reform measures
again. It is also announced that, failing every-
thing else, Premier Propsting will introduce a Bill
to provide for the election of a Convention to draft
a new Constitution—which Bill the Council
will stamp on with ribald laughter, as usual.
Not even the most violent daily paper in Tas-
mania dare say openly that the only adequate
remedy is to abolish the Council, and that the
only way (barring revolution) to abolish the Coun-
cil is for the Assembly to stop all supplies, and
disband the whole public service, and go back to
Chaos, until the silly old men consent to their

own abolition. There isn’t one daily paper m
Tasmania, or one politician, that is prepared to
face the situation, or to realise that it is impossible
to get reform without breaking something. If
Premier Propsting isn’t prepared to take some
such course as this, the next best thing is to
abolisti the Assembly and let the House of
Dodery run the whole show. The Assembly
does nothing nowadays and can do nothing
while the present arrangement lasts, for the House
of Dodery reverses all its acts; and if the
present state of things is to last, the cost
of the Assembly might as well be saved.
Also its abolition would produce three good
results. It would abolish the stupid bi-cameral
system. It would make the people realise their
position. At present they are ruled by the
House of Dodery, but the nominal existence of
the futile Assembly prevents them recognising
the fact; if the matter were brought home to
them in all its naked horror, they would probably
make their House of Dodery reform itself if they
had to coerce it with clubs and road-metal. And
under the proposed system every Tasmanian demo-
crat would recognise the advisability of extending
the power of the Australian Parliament —the one
wholly democratic Legislature in Australia —and
would howl for Federal graduated land, income,
and absentee taxes, Federal railway management,
a Federal Arbitration law which would include
State public servants, Federal control of educa-
tion, and many other desirable things.
The Victorian Railway Policy.
Chief Railway Commissioner Tait, of Victoria,
has been talking to the Standing Railway
Committee in this way:
We have now inspected nearly the whole of the
Victorian railway system, and in doing so have been
in nearly every portion of the State. Our observations
lead us to the opinion that railway development in
Victoria is considerably ahead of the general develop-
ment and requirements of the State and public, and that
if the Victorian railways are to be made to pay their
way (that is, to earn their operating and maintenance
expenses and interest and other charges in full) no more
non-paying lines should be built until much of the land
along the existing lines which is suitable, and is or can
be made available for closer settlement, is taken up
for that purpose. There are hundreds of thousands of
acres of land along the existing railway lines which
should be utilised before money is expended to afford
railway facilities to additional areas.
This is common-sense talk as far as the Commis-
sioners can go; but it is somebody else’s business
to go further. Suppose railway construction
stops now, obviously the “hundreds of thou-
sands of acres of land along the existing
lines ” will jump in value. So long as
new lines are being built people are not forced
to pay extortionate prices either to rent or to pur-
chase lands in the older parts; they can go out
and get the new land for little or nothing. But
if, as the result of Commissioner Tait’s policy,
there is no such outlet, owners of land served by
existing lines will be masters of the situation.
The proper thing, undoubtedly, is to stop railway
construction until available lands are occupied;
but that step must not be taken at the expense
of those who want to go on the land to use
it. If the stoppage of railway building is
to simply result in increased competition for the
property of absentee landlords, and in increased
rents to be sent to them, then the country might
almost as well go on borrowing to build lines that
won’t pay. The State will be ruined in either
case. If the stoppage of railway construction is
to add to the value of the desirable land served by
existing lines, then the State must see that it, and
not the owners of the land, get that increased
value, so that the money may be spent for the
general good—used, for instance, in paying off
the debt on the line which has made the land of
so much value. That will involve no hard-
ship upon the present owner. It will be
simple and elementary justice. Added value
haying been given to property by something
which the State is doing, the State has surely a
better right to that added value than anybody
else. If the Vie. Government doesn’t back up the
Commissioners’ policy with a heavy graduated
land tax and an absentee surtax, it will be like
saving the State from one robber in order to bind
it and hand it over to another robber —saving it
from the man who takes interest in order to put it
at the mercy of the man who takes rent.
A Financial Reform.
Treasurer Waddell of N.S.W. lately laid it
down as part of the new policy of economy that
the expenditure of borrowed money must not on
any account, for some time to come, exceed
£1,500,000 a year, and “nearly all the money
borrowed (except for renewals) should be devoted
to the repurchase of lands for closer settlement.”
This frantic tolly and extravagance is called
economy in N.S.W., and seems to be pretty
generally accepted as such. When the matter is
closely considered, it appears that Treasurer
Waddell proposes first, as a severe reform, to
raise £1,500,000 a year in loans, which, in pro-
portion to population, is much the same as if
Britain borrowed, in time of profound peace,
about £45,000,000 a year from Germany or
America to keep its head above water, instead of,
as it does, putting up several millions a year out
of revenue in reduction of old loans. Then, even
this frenzy of borrowing is only proposed as a
temporary economy—it is to last for some time,
but later on, it appears to be considered, N.S.W.
may start to howl on the loan market in a louder
voice. Most of this loan money is to be devoted
to the repurchase of large estates for closer
settlement. When these estates were sold the
proceeds were spent as revenue—over £50,000,000
of N.S.W. revenue has been obtained out of
lands in one way and another—but when they
have to be bought back again the revenue will
not disgorge the money, or any part of the money,
originally received. Also, the Waddell Govern-
ment keeps on selling land and treating the
proceeds as revenue, while it is to commence
buying the land back at a greatly enhanced price
out of loans. In almost any country save
Australia this would be called utterly insane
finance; but in Australia it is seriously proposed
as economy and vigorous reform. Again, there
is no mention of any scheme to prevent big
estates accumulating again. There is no graduated
land tax in N.S.W. to make the holding of large
estates unprofitable. The State keeps on selling
land to selectors, and using the money as
revenue; and the selectors keep on selling out to
large laud grabbers ; and the State is to borrow
money to buy back the land at a greatly increased
price from the large grabbers and re-sell it to
small holders; and there is nothing to prevent
them selling out again to large grabbers ; and then
the State will, presumably, borrow again to buy
out another generation of big landholders at a
further increase of price, and so the thing will go
on ad infinitum. N.S.W., as a matter of fact,
has no need to borrow a penny for the resumption
of large estates. All it requires is a graduated
land-tax on so heavy a scale (with an absentee-
tax on top of it), that the holding of big estates
(especially by absentees) in the fertile part of
the country will become utterly unprofitable.
Then the Government could sit back and
watch the big estates cut themselves up
ten times more rapidly than the State could
possibly do the work. Also, it would have
the pleasure of knowing that it had made the
aggregation of further big estates wholly im-
possible. The new race of small landholders
would get the land at a much lower price than if
it was bought up by the State; the graduated
land-tax would itself reduce the exorbitant value
now put on agricultural property. And instead
of adding <£1,500,000 a year of new debt to its
already intolerable load the State would enjoy
about £200,000 or £300,000 a year of new revenue
at first and a diminishing amount afterwards,
which it could devote to public works or to paying
off old debts. The only visible difficulty in the
way of this simple expedient is that in N.S.W.
any process of reform which doesn’t involve a
loan is regarded with dark suspicion. The loan is
a guarantee of respectability, so to speak.
The Dirty Socialistic Farmer.
If it were not for the injury he indirectly causes
to others it would serve the anti-socialistic farmer
right if he were left severely alone. For his
benefit, the Victorian Government, a while back,
imported an expensive Director of Agriculture,
and desired him to do his best towards improving
a “ great natural industry.” Having taken stock
of matters, this Director, Williamson Wallace,
lately met a conference of Western Victorian
dairy-farmers, and laid before them a complete
scheme for bringing Victorian butter up to the
highest existing standard, and keeping it there.
Having at first told the farmers that 60 per cent,
of Victorian butter was made from privately
separated cream, under no supervision whatever,
and that out of 104 shires and boroughs
producing milk, from which the butter
was ultimately exported, not a dozen were
inspecting their dairies and milking-yards pro-
perly, he told them he proposed to substitute
licensing for registration, thereby doing away
with a lot of trouble in collecting fees and in pro-
secuting dirty and obstreperous cow-punchers;
he also desired to abolish, over the greater
part of the State, the provedly incompetent
and farcical system of municipal inspection
and to substitute therefor Agricultural De-
partment inspectors, who would in no way be
responsible to the dairymen, and who would in-
struct as well as inspect. Only those shires,
he said, which had hitherto inspected their
milk factories properly would continue to do so,
retaining their present powers as long as they
acted up to the gospel of cleanliness. Having
listened to Mr. Wallace with their customary
bucolic stolidity the assembled delegates
enthusiastically and unanimously resolved
that “they were opposed to the system of
Government interference with dairy-inspection,
which is being satisfactorily carried out by
several municipal councils,” etc., etc. —but they
were ultimately persuaded to meet the Director
and Minister in Melbourne to talk matters over.
These cow-wallopers from the notoriously rich
western district of Victoria evidently labor
under the mistaken impression that the State
originally started the butter export industry by
bonuses, and kept it going ever since by arranging
for cheap freights and by supervision and regula-
tion, solely for their private profit and advantage.
Such is not the case. The idea was to benefit
the State generally—the farmers, the consumers,
the factory hands, and the employees on wages—
as to the latter both by tending to raise wages and
by providing more employment than before.
That the State’s intention has not been
carried out fully the farmer himself well
knows —also, he knows why. But the in-
dustry having been put on its feet, and
affording much employment that did not exist
before, it is the first business of the State to see
that the shiftless, dirty or lazy farmer doesn’t
close any of those avenues of employment; and
the absurd system of municipal inspection, under
which Councillor Smith appoints the man who
will have to inspect—and ought, perhaps, to con-
demn —Councillor Smith’s own dairy, having been
an obvious failure, it is the State’s business, as
well as its duty, to step in and do the inspection
itself, as it should have done from the first. The
point is that the farmer has no locus standi in the
matter, any more than a dozen or so contractors
who build sections of a railway for the State.
Before the citizens are allowed to use the line it is
tested and passed by competent, trained inspec-
tors ; any contractor who claimed the right to
inspect his own section would be laughed at as an
amazing joke or a new sort of lunatic.

Australia’s Deficiency of Defence.
Mr. Chapman, Australian Minister for Defence,
took the occasion of the St. Patrick’s Day luncheon
to speak in approval of the Australian military
system and administration :
Those who said that we had no munitions of war in this
country were counting their chickens before they were
hatched. There was a very good ammunition factory in
Melbourne, and, though they did not propose to publish
all they were doing in this respect to the world, he could
say that, as far as the finances would permit, good work
was being done, and there was no question of what Aus-
tralia would do if menaced by a foe. He was hopeful
that, in regard to war material, Australia would soon be
self-contained, and not dependent upon over-sea sup-
plies. Those who told these direful stories about the
defective condition of the defences were croakers.
This is very vague reassurance. On all sides
there is grumbling and discontent. Forces already
inadequate are rapidly dwindling in numbers.
It is known that the number of modern rifles in
the country is absurdly inadequate. Of modern
artillery there is practically none. The coast
defences are confined to a few out-of-date forts ;
there is no torpedo fleet, and the conditions of the
naval subsidy to Britain give no assurance that
there will be any warships at all for coast defence.
These are facts—“direful,” certainly, but abso-
lutely accurate and full justification of “croak-
ing,” and not to be swept away by the mere
“ hope ” of a Minister that soon Australia will be
self-contained as regards military material—a
hope which, under the circumstances that nothing
is being done to build even a small-arms factory,
is practically equivalent to a hope that the moon
will soon supply Australia with cheese. The
military position is such as demands root-and-
branch reform. The forces are run at present on
British lines. Britain is a vastly rich country,
thickly peopled, and with a navy so strong as to
give British politicians the idea that they can
play the fool with the army in safety. Australia is
a poor, debt-ridden, thinly-settled continent, with
no navy and no reliance other than on the skill
and courage of a small population against foreign
attack. It cannot afford, therefore, to follow the
British system of extravagant muddlein organising
its defences, and must look around for some other
model, cheaper and more efficient. That is
to be found in the Swiss army. Switzerland,
like Australia, is a democratic country, and
has no need, therefore, to make its army a
refuge for titled noodles. It has a popula-
tion even smaller than that of Australia,
and the narrowness of its resources compels
frugality (as does the extent of Australian debts).
The Swiss army is, for a population of 3,500,000,
a big one; 500,000 men can be mobilised almost
instantly. It is a cheap one, the total cost being
about £1,000,000 a year (Australia spends nearly
that much on its miserable jumble of a defence
force). The Swiss army is, according to the judg
ment of military experts, an efficient force, and
certainly its reputation has kept the soil of
Switzerland free from invasion for a full century.
The essence of the Swiss military system is
reliance upon a common patriotism to secure a
practically universal training; caste privileges
and class luxuries have no place. From boyhood
every male citizen is drilled and is brought up to
the obligation of giving a small space of his time
each year to military training. A few specialists
are kept permanently employed as instructors,
but there is no standing army, no barracks full of
soldiers whose idle hands must naturally turn
to mischief. The army is the nation. So it
should be in Australia.

The Westralian Elections.
The platform on which Westralian Laborites will
appeal to the electors early in May suffers from
its size ; there are many non-essentials scattered
amongthe essentials—the thing wants dry-blowing.
Most, however, of what is best in political pro-
posals is included, except the cessation of borrow-
ing. Apparently Westralian Laborites have
swallowed the lie that theirs is a young country
which needs developing, and that the only way to
develop it is to borrow. Westralia certainly is
a young country that needs developing, but
it is also a young country out ot which
the wealth is being torn with a bewildering rush ;
and the idea of hanging on to a fair proportion of
that wealth for the development of the country
has not yet soaked into the party. Two millions
a year of profits, made by digging up the
country’s wealth, are being sent out of the State.
It would be a perfectly fair thing for the State,
having been lightened of that much of its
wealth, to claim a fair proportion of it for the
development of its wealth in other parts.
Instead of doing that, however, the State
allows its wealth to be carted off and
then borrows it back at a stiff rate of interest
to develop other wealth. And that other wealth
will, no doubt, go the same way. The same
locally : the extraction of about £9,000,000 worth
of gold a year is adding hundreds of thousands to
land values, and the State borrows heavily,
instead of taking a substantial part of those land
values to develop other wealth to replace that
which is being exhausted. It is folly—folly of
which a private concern couldn’t be cap-
able .and go on living—and still the Westralian
Laborites say no word concerning it. Apart from
that omission, the party’s platform is one that
any Liberal ought to be glad to stand upon. It
includes a progressive land tax, with exemptions
up to £3OO, a progressive tax on incomes (though
there is no distinction, as there should be, between
incomes derived from personal exertion and those
that flow from investments), a progressive absentee
tax ; the abolition of the Hackett House ; State
banking; and the nationalisation of the liquor
traffic. There is much else, but these remain
after the dry-blowing process ; and in fighting an
election the rest would probably best be left on
the tailings heap for the time being.
The Indeterminate Sentence.
An ill-regulated Melbourne lady, of poor manners,
recently threw some much-needed contumely on
the methods of alleged charitable institutions, and
incidentally put the case for the “other side ” in
the much discussed matter of indeterminate
sentences. She was first discovered in a comatose
state on St. Kilda’s Esplanade and after the
doctors had pumped considerable poison out of
her and nursed her back to life, she was invited to
explain her actions. The court offered to send
her to a “charitable home,’’but the lady broke in
hastily: “I am sick of these homes; I have had
enough of them. I would sooner go to gaol
because when your time is done you can get out.”
She was remanded to give someone a chance to
offer her a billet (probably at a sweating wage).
Seeing that Premier Bent is now proposing the
introduction of indeterminate sentences, and that
penal authorities in other States are by way of
following suit, the lady’s protest—founded on per-
sonal experience—is opportune; and, seeing that
the indeterminate sentence system is supposed to
be as much for the ad vantage of the prisoner as any •
one else, her view of the matter is entitled to con-
sideration. Most of the so-called “charitable”
homes are merely places where the obstreperous
damsel and the giddy girl are compelled to toil
hard, and on “ probation ” ; that is, on an inde-
terminate sentence. As soon as they are con-
sidered “ regenerate ” and fit to be trusted alone
they are put in a situation —and there have been
rumors that the hard-worker who is of real value
to the institution often takes a long time to
officially regenerate. It was against the hope-
less outlook, the ever-vanishing, ever-distant
chance of freedom, that the comatose lady
of St. Kilda Esplanade protested. “When
your time is done you can get out.” It
is easy to talk of wise administration, but
every country —let alone every State in this
country —cannot hope to always possess a keen
judge of human character, a sympathetic man or
woman who can perceive, appreciate and reward
honest effort while differentiating between that
and hypocritical snuffle. And, beside all that,
there is the large question of political and social
influence, which is liable to lead the authorities
to perceive evidences of reform in the man with
a “pull,” and not in the other man. Those who
are advocating the indeterminate Sentence as a
panacea for much crime, are hereby invited to
consider it from the “subject’s” point of view.
The Bulletin doesn’t say that it is the correct
view, still it deserves to be heard.
Sydney Telegraph, in its underhand campaign
against the N.S.W. Arbitration Court and the
Federal Arbitration Bill, prints an article—
“ The Success of Voluntary Arbitration.” Well,
N.S. Wales had voluntary arbitration for years ;
and Coghlan, the State’s official historian, tells
in the State’s own official history (“ Wealth and
Progress of N.S.W.”) what sort of success it was .
After the termination of the maritime strike of 1890 a
Eoyal Commission was appointed for the purpose of in-
quiring into the causes and means for prevention of
industrial disputes. The introduction into Parliament
early in 1892 of a Bill to provide for the establishment of a
Council of Conciliation and Arbitration was one of the
results of the Commission. The Bill became law and was
to continue in force for four years from March 31, 1892.
Under it two Councils were established —a Council of
Arbitration, consisting of three, and a Council of Concili-
ation, consisting of 18 members. . . From the time the
two Councils were appointed to the end of 1894 only one
case of conciliation and one of arbitration were dealt with
by them. Negotiations were opened in a large number of
cases, but without success ; the principle of the Act being
a purely voluntary one, the Councils had no power to
bring either party to a dispute before the industrial
tribunal.
So, having tried voluntary arbitration for two
years, and proved it an unmitigated failure, Par-
liament in 1895 deliberately refused to vote
supplies to continue the farce any longer. And
this is the system which the Telegraph impu-
dently calls a “success” !
*
In S. Australia another child’s death is reported,
the deluded parents having followed the tenets
of the bald and whiskered fraud Downs and
refused to call in medical assistance. It would be
no interference with “religious liberty” if the
persons who make a profit out of preaching such
brutality as “faith-healing” were to be prose-
cuted, and put out of harm’s way in a prison.
An adult who, having a disease or meeting with an
accident, cares to die without medical aid is within
his rights, so long as he dies quietly and decently
and doesn’t disturb the neighbors by howling,
or doesn’t bleed publicly to death in the streets.
He has the same right as any other suicide has—
or should have—and there is plenty of unconse-
crated ground to bury him in if society is so par-
ticular that it objects to such people mouldering
in consecrated earth. But the person who prac-
tises his brutal doctrine of neglect on helpless
children, and lets them die miserably in honor of
his snuffle, should get three months in gaol, and
any heartless, hog-like “prophet” who incites
him to it should get three years. Faith-healing is
the doctrine of fools. Also it is the doctrine of
callous and parsimonious people who let their de-
pendents die to save medical expenses. What a
chance was missed by stepmother Macdonald,
now under sentence of death in Queensland for
the slaying, by prolonged cruelty and neglect, of
her step-daughter, in not pleading, as an explana-
tion of the neglect, that she was a faith-healer and
had “ left the matter to God ! ” Then she might
have had at least one sympathiser ; Dowie would
Erobably have burst a blood-vessel in the fury of
is defence.

A Melbournian writes: —
There was a quaint up-rising in Melbourne Town Hall,
the other day, when “a representative gathering oi'
ladies” met to form a “ Women’s Political League.”
During the past two years there have been some curious
conservative meetings in Melbourne ; but for first-grade,
high-stepping, pure-merino Toryism, the gathering under
notice easily established a record. Even the few males
present —A. E. Clarke, Fairbairn, M.L.A., and
M‘Cutchkon, M.L.A.—were in thorough keeping with
the prevailing sentiment. M‘Cutcheon’9 whole speech
bristled with refreshing remarks, and he fairly bolted
when he came to the Arbitration Act
“ If that Act were passed it would be impossible for an
employer to start a business or, indeed, carry on any
business that he might have started. . . . The Act would
enable employees to rule their employers.”
Then, taking a long breath, M‘Cutchkon wound-up :
“ It would no doubt surprise them to hear that Aus-
tralia owed £200,000,000, and the interest on this money
would go on growing greater so long as Socialistic legisla-
tion continued to be put on the Statute-book.”
And just when M'Cutciibon was getting interesting—
when he was, no doubt, going to explain how his party
would reduce the interest and pay otf the loans, and how
the £200,000,000 mentioned had been spent by the Labor
party in building Trades Halls and running eight-hour
day processions—the report stops short. But it sounds
quite natural to find a Miss Ebden, in seconding
M'Cutcheon’s motion, declaring that “ it had surprised a
good many present to hear the state of affairs as described
by Mr. M'Cutcueon.” Then the meeting got quite com-
fortable, and references to “ the conservative class being
left out in the cold so far," and “ amongst the conserva-
tive class there was a great lack of discipline,” blcame
quite common. A “ badge of membership ” was decided
on, and a committee of twelve was elected. Then the
gathering shook out its frills, put its scented haiidker-
chief into its reticule, and tripped daintily down the
steps into the common sunshine.
The House of Dodery.
(AND SENILE LEGISLATORS GENERALLY.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They bend beneath the weight of years,
And yet their hate is strong
For all that dries up human tears
Or fights with human wrong ;
The heart is hard as granite old,
The brain is dull—the pulse is cold.
They sit enthroned in pomp and state
As Pharaoh, girt with awe ;
They pass a niddering veto on
Each just and gentle law ;
The dottrel’s voice is nearly sped,
The dottrel’s soul is past and dead.
The balance in the bank is good,
The mental balance gone;
And yet the roots of prejudice
In stubborn strength live on }
The senile fibres feel decay,
The senile hate is fresh to-day.
’Tis said that Wisdom comes with Age ;
Go—tread that fiction down !
For only poor and paltry craft
Is twined in Age’s crown ;
If Wisdom lurk in coward fear
In sooth the sages all are here !
It heaves—does Age —a futile curse
On all the hopes of Youth ;
It spits in pallid impotence
To foul the face of Truth ;
In Custom’s grip—a hopeless slave—
It gibbers on beside the grave.
When youth and love and hope are dead
And aspiration cool,
When all that’s left is but a blend
Of dotard and of fool,
A nation lifts with tender care
A wreck to fill the Judgment Chair.
When all that lent to life a grace
Is buried deep for aye,
When mind is but a flickering flash
That fails behind the clay,
With oare we lift the Form Decayed
To slowly die where laws are made.
To slowly die where laws are made
And leave the touch of death,
Where all should glow with legal life
And heave with legal breath ;
Where law should pulse with pulsing land,
We pine beneath a ghostly hand !

W. F. Hawtrey advertised his “Two Mr.
Wetherbys” as “a lesson for wives.” Every
man, of course, saw Hawtrey’s meaning clearly
enough. He and his author, St. John Hankin,
wanted to let woman know that man isn’t an
animal she can fool with for ever, and that if she
wants her husband to go on loving her she must
let him have some joy on his own account. The
bad Mr. Wetherby, who is Hawtrey, married a
lady with ideas of her own about such things,
and she put her foot down with such emphasis
that a legal separation followed. It lasted for 12
months. Then, when the lady found that grass
widowhood had all the inconveniences of the real
thing without its compensations, and wanted
to return, Hawtrey put his foot down with
emphasis, said he had mislaid the love
he once had for her, having had no use for it for
so long, and wouldn’t have her back. The lady
felt hurt at this development. Hawtrey ought to
fire off a gun at this point to drawn attention to
the fact that the moral is in the neighborhood.
Down at the Lyceum, in fact, they would
emphasise it by making the distracted lady rush
headlong under a steam - hammer, which would
stay up while she addressed the audience and bade
it take warning by her unhappy fate. The man
who had paid ss. to have his wife taught what a
dreadful thing it is to come between a man and
his fun would then go away feeling satisfied that
even his wife couldn’t have missed the point.
As it is, there is another Mr. Wetherby—Mr.
Gregan McMahon Wetherby, the good one; held
up by everybody as the type of all the virtues;
who even satisfies his elderly maiden aunt.
He is the bad Wetherby’s brother. And then
something happens and the truth is out that the
domestic paragon is a fraud. And just because
Hawtrey didn’t fire off a gun, or use a steam-
hammer, you could hear it all over the place in
women’s voices that that was the lesson —that one
man isn't to be trusted more than another. It
really does seem a bit hard on a man to spend half-
a-sovereign to have that idea put into his wife’s
head ; the chances are that it will get there soon
enough, anyhow, and for nothing.
* * * *
Compared with “The Lady of Ostend,”
“ The Two Mr. Wetherbys” hasn’t so striking a
main situation—not so garish a one, anyway—but
there is more and better workmanship in the
play. The dialogue is smart rather than witty,
with some good things in it. The bad Wetherby’s
ultra-virtuous wife can’t understand why her
husband won’t have her back —there must be
another woman in the case. “What immoral
minds you moral people have! ” he says.
But, here and there, there is a visible
straining after epigram and paradox. Most
of the good things are given to the bad
Wetherby—the Hawtrey Wetherby—to say ; and
Mr. Hawtrey helps the author out exceedingly
well. His French Count in the “ Ostend ” piece
cannot bear comparison with his study in this.
Poorly played, “ The Two Mr. Wetherbys’’could
never be a success. There are none of the
boisterous farce effects which seem to be looked
for in comedy—which, anyway, seem to be the
most popular things in modern comedy. Its suc-
cess is a matter of brains rather than of lungs and
acrobatism, and Hawtrey supplies the brains.
Miss Lane (the bad Wetherby’s wife with the stiff
upper lip) gives support of the same kind. The
other Wetherby’s wife, Miss Winifred Austin,
vyasn’t always audible on Saturday night, and put
little force into her work, except in the one
dramatic scene of the play—where the Bad
Wetherby teaches his lesson—which was the best
thing of all. McMahon is a passable other
Wetherby, and the rest of a small cast deserves
neither high praise nor a brick. The opening
house was overflowing.

It is impossible to any longer conceal the
fact that Fitzgeralds’ circus opens at Belmore
Park, Sydney, on Saturday. The truth is
mighty and will prevail, and even though it is
buried in a cave and boulders are heaped above it,
it insists on rising up at the box office and
exhibiting itself at the very moderate charge of
four, three, two and one. The Fitz. circus now
includes a Strong Man (Dr. Gordon) who carries
a horse up a ladder and does the other
feats of strength that seem to be recognised as the
right things for a strong man to do. Why a
strong man should invariably carry a horse up a
ladder The Bulletin knoweth not; if this
paper were in that line of business it would
carry a bookcase or a cow occasionally
for variety, and it would sometimes carry
some popular myth of the hour like the Six
Hatters or the wrecked crew of the Petriana. Six
Japanese wrestlers, engaged (it is announced) by
Mr. Taranoski Kitamura, and all members of the
wrestlers’ trades-union of Osaka, are delayed on
the way, but if they don’t stop to wrestle with a
Russian ironclad on the high seas they will be
here by April 2. Everything else that the soul
of man can crave in the way of horse, dog, girl
and such-like exponents of circus art are also
included in the bill.

When visiting artists appear as stars they
must be judged as stars. From that point of
view, Miss Lilian Foulis is not of the first magni-
tude ; hardly of the second. This is not to say
that she is not an excellent violinist, since in the
first class there are never more than two or three
at a time, and in the second from a dozen to a
score. She plays beautifully and delicately, and,
as she is still at the right end of her career, she
may in a few years develop a greater individuality.
At present, the pretty young Scotch thistle gives
somewhat the impression of playing things as she
has learnt them. In time, her tone ought to
become very fine; her cantabile (why cannot that
word be popularised to “singing-effect ’’?), as we
are told the Times puts it, “ is delightful to listen
to.”

Sydney Lyceum is still sicklied o’er
with the green light on “The Face at the
Window,” but Le Loup will shriek for the last
time on Friday night. On Saturday “The
Ladder of Life ” will be revived.
* * * *
A second visit to “ Sign of the Cross,'’ at
Her Majesty’s (Sydney), and a prior study of the
programme reveals the fact that our old-young
friend Lily Titheradge is playing the boy Ste-
phan us in the splendidly-staged production.
Lily’s acting in the “Two Little Vagabonds”
years ago will not soon be forgotten, and she now
plays the ancient Roman boy as well as she then
played the modern British one. Her Stephanus
is boyish, pathetic, and as natural as could be ex-
peoted. Such a lot of imagination is necessary to
conjure up the possible boy of 1900 years ago.
We don’t know the Roman male offspring very
well; we know still less of the Christian martyr
boy—the regenerate boy who never dragged the
cat’s tail or smoked a cigarette at the street cor-
ner. But many types of boy existed in old Rome,
so Stephanus may have infested the catacombs,
previous to painting the Coliseum red. Apart
from taking her thrashing like a man, Miss
Titheradge looks the boy part capitally, and her
back view as she goes in to speak to the lions
does not cause a smile, as did the rear aspect
of one small martyr when the “Cross”
first came to Sydney. End of this week will
see the close of the trago-comedy. If it stopped
longer Mercia would have to get her sainted robe
washed all round the foot of the skirt. “Teach
you in the public schools, lady ? ” asks Marcus S.
of the maiden. And this is the first intimation
to the unlettered public that there were State
schools in Rome. Mercia might have replied,
“ What! in this frock ! ” It is tied around the
feet and swathed to the knees, and lies 10 inches
all around on the Roman roads. And probably
the Appian Way and the Forum were no cleaner
than George-street North.

Next Saturday “ the Pierrot Enter-
tainers” open in St. James’ Hall, Phillip-street,
Sydney. Their entertainment is said to be on
the same lines as that of Mel. B. Spurr, only they
are four. The Pierrots don’t mention their
names, which is a curious exhibition of modesty
in theatrical life, but they are said to be good
though anonymous; the suppression of identity is
not with a view to avoid direful after-conse-
quences.

The Tivoli's bill now includes an educated
monkey—put on, presumably, to show the man
from the country, who is down for the Show,
what great things a little schooling can do for us.
For the rest the programme is still mostly comedy
and music. Miss Frances Leslie, an American
soprano, who is understood to be out here for her
health’s sake, gives tone to the proceedings and
acts as a sort of counterblast to the monkey.
Singing of the quality which she provides is not
often heard in the halls, to which,_ by the way,
this is Miss Leslie’s first introduction —she is in
opera in her own country. Clarke and Hamilton
still give their very clever performance; but they
are going soon now, and the Empire girls will
come in their place; and the place will be very
hard to fill.

Next week is the Passover of Melbourne
shows, and now is the time for pasting “Last
Nights ” across the broad bosom of every poster.
“ A Country Girl ” no longer booms at Her
Majesty’s, having given place on Tuesday (D.V..)
to a revival of “Ma Mie Rosette,” which will
hold the Williamsonian fort until Saturday. And
then the Comic Opera Co. (minus Rose Musgrove,
who is engaged for the forthcoming “Darling of
the Gods ”) will leave Melbourne once again, with
a view to returning in the inevitable future.
Meanwhile giddy-minded Rosette aforesaid is
dreaming the shocking things that might eventu-
ate if she were to lead herself into temptation at
the king’s chateau—dreaming of how she would
forfeit her good name as a gardener’s daughter,
and become a scandalous Marquise, clothed in
sin and diamonds, and horribly disliked by the
king’s previous girl. The Bulletin cannot swear
to the production of “Rosette ” on Tuesday, but,
up to the moment of going to press, this Journal
had no doubts on the subject.

The larcenous Indian who swallows a dose
of Rough on Rats, also the pair of painted appari-
tions who suffer the stomach-pump for his mis-
deed, continue to be casually hugged by the
wrong girls at Melbourne Princess’s. “A
Stranger in A Strange Land ” is a slicker farce
than it was three weeks ago, which is to say
that the Willoughby Co. rush it through with
more vim and agility than at first. Miss Laura
Nicholls, in the character of a purblind bride
is a particularly bright and earnest young
Bendigonian, and Miss Roxy Barton looks the
part of a Yankee heiress, but the habit of putting
out her right arm to give point to her obser-
vations grows rather tiring after one has wit-
nessed the feat for the fiftieth time. Among the
four men who don’t fly around in blankets, the
lengthy quack doctor is open to considerable
improvement, likewise one of the three Indians
fails to conceal the fact that he stands
about a foot shorter than the others. Two or
three nights of “What Happened to Jones,” will
finish off the season next week in time for the co.
to resume its Indian Mutiny at Sydney on
Easter Saturday. Melbourne has a long-standing
affection for “Jones,” and two or more nights of
that historic bagman should fill a public want.

There will be a matinee at Her Majesty’s
on Saturday for the benefit of Pete Hughes, the
merry little man of theatrical business who has
for many years been associated with the J.C.W.
enterprises. Pete is about to leave Australia, and
his friends of the profesh are contributing to this
matinee in the same spirit that moves a church
congregation to give the shepherd a purse of
sovereigns when he resigns his practice. The
programme constructed for the occasion is just
about strong enough to draw all Melbourne.
* * * *
Bland Holt’s season at Melbourne Royal
closes on Saturday. “The Flood Tide” is
accepted as the brightest and, in many respects,
the absolutely best of the melodramas from Drury
Lane. It might be more convincingly inter-
preted by sundry members of the co. who per-
form their respective duties in a cut and dried
manner of their own without trying to get inside
the character of the part. But if the acting, as a
rule, is not true to the play, it is at least the work
of experienced players, and the general effect
of their efforts is satisfactory as usual. The
scene of Captain Walter Baker’s persecution by
the true born British cads of his regiment would
be quite impressive if the principal cad (Albert
Norman) didn’t make himself so extravagantly
unpleasant. Norman’s only way of uttering
scornful remarks or insolent speeches is to declaim
them at the insulted-parties as though he were
asking to be kicked, and the situation is made to
look impossible by their seemingly unnatural
self-restraint. The officah’s hatefulness is absurdly
overdone. Other overdone things in the perform-
ance are the “ light ’’ comedy business by Bland
and Mrs. Holt and the light tragedy business
by Miss Ross; but the occasional bits of
pathos are so insufficiently done that they
present a raw appearance. All the same,
Melbourne will be ready for a revival of “The
Flood Tide” next time its well-beloved Holt
resumes possession of the Royal. Cecil Raleigh
has made some alterations in the play since it was
first produced. The real Thompson is a less
eccentric dipsomaniac than he was, and the
moderately wicked mother of the bogus Mrs.
Thompson gets drowned in the flood scene instead
of being left lamenting among the luggage at a
railway station. But the original version, as
staged by Bland Holt, is more than good enough
to go on with.
* * * *
At the Opera House a considerable change
of bill is promised for Saturday, and a further
contingent of new artists will arrive a week
later.
* * * * >„
Mrs. Sims Reeves “in a Repertoire of her
Late Husband’s Songs” seems a somewhat un-
accountable item to Australian audiences. The
younger people don’t understand that her head is
“made up” to resemble her late husband's top
piece, as far as that of a thin-faced young woman
can be made to suggest a broad-faced old man who
wore a moustache. On the other hand, the lady’s
efforts to imitate her husband’s way of getting his
notes off his chest are quite astounding to the
many Anglo-Australians who remember Reeves in
the days when he w.as still able to sing fairly
easily. Born in 1822, he was presumably a septu-
agenarian before his young pupil—the future Mrs.
R.—heard him sing at all. Certainly she isn’t
old enough to have any recollection of how he
used to perform before his voice had gone to
pieces. The little woman’s imitation of Reeves
the Ruin gives one no idea of the tenor in his
prime, but it is interesting for its oddness. A
sort of vocal memorial to a famous identity.
* * * *
Miss Marguerite Henderson, the Vic-
torian soprano who was' farewelled two or three
years ago, has returned with, perhaps, a some-
what smaller voice than the one she took to
Europe for cultivation. She gave a concert at
Melbourne Masonic Hall last week, and although
her singing, in the advanced-amateur sense of the
words, was bright and artistic,, it didn’t nearly
fulfil the predictions of her old Conservatorium
admirers. Miss Henderson was to have been
“another Melba” by this time, but for the pre-
sent she seems content to work in the same
narrow, German groove as before. A constant
devotion to German lieder dulls the edge of
▼ocalism.

The Majeronis have finished their season
at Adelaide Royal with the old reliable “His
Natural Life.” The public supported them fairly
well, but not so well as they deserved. Previous
productions included a drama built round an air-
ship, and one evening only (oddly described by
the management as a “ Ladies’ Bargain-Night ’ )
of the weepful “East Lynne.” The-Tivoli
season has also ended. The Six Empire Girls
have gone, and the Two Bells (who bore an
amazing resemblance to two of the “ Empires ”),
and those particularly neat wire-walkers, the
Brothers Powers, and Sayles of the india-rubber
mouth; and darkness has descended once more
upon the House of Rickards.

Another remarkably fine profit is shown, equal to
£24 Bs. 2d. per cent, on the paid capital of £75,000.
Even on total funds (capital and reserves) the return was
at the rate of £l3 18s. per cent.; and still some people
wonder why the State should cast an eye in the direction
of insurance business —why it can’t be content to confine
itself to the things that yield 2 per cent, or so, and leave
the things that yield 14 per cent, to Private Enterprise !
Certainly the co. has had more luck than usual in
the matter of losses during the past year. Still, it is
many a year since there wasn’t a big margin between
losses and premiums. The past four years’ figures are
Premiums Losses p.c.

So in four years only 52'8 per cent, of the net premiums
have been returned to the insurers in the shape of claims.
The other 47’2 per cent, has gone either iri expenses or
in profits for the co. On the whole, these co.’s Ought to
congratulate themselves upon keeping such a business
for so long. The co.’s interest on investments (nature of
investments, as usual, not stated) amounted to £4114,
which was at the rate of about £4 2s. per cent. Interest
alone was thus equal to paying a dividend of just about
64 per cent.

Chemist John Digby, who has several shops
scattered over suburban Melbourne, has been up to one
of the oldest and riskiest tricks of his very tricky trade.
He has been playing the old game of substitution, and
was burned pretty badly in Justice Hood’s court the other
day. For months he had been bamboozling his Pink Pill
customers with the well-worn story that he had in bulk
some pills which were “ just the same as” Dr. Williams ,
at a fraction of the price. Wonder why this piece °‘
fraudulent impertinence thrives so well in the drug
trade ? It is much the same as if one asked at a book-
stall for a novel by George Meredith, and was urged
by the beardless youth behind the counter to take
one by Marie Corelli instead. “It is really
just as good, and ever so much more for the money.
The impertinence of the insinuating chemist’s clerk is
just about as bad in its way. Digby gave his customers
the imitation, but Justice Hood gave Digby the genuine
article. There were half-a-dozen witnesses in court ready
to swear, with dates and all the details complete, that the
fraud had been perpetrated repeatedly by Digby himseit
and his assistants. The official analyst was also
on hand to testify that his “ just as good ” pills contained
only one or two of the ingredients, and had none of the
medicinal properties of the genuine. When Digby saw
the array of evidence he sought a settlement, ine
Pink Pill people then let him down lightly. After the
settlement, Justice Hood granted the injunction and
awarded them £5O damages and costs, which win
probably run into several hundred pounds. Time was
given to Digby to pay. If imitators generally got more
of this sauce there would soon be a roaring trade tor
Judge Molesworth and his bankruptcy associates in tne
other States. There is some prospect of this, as Dr.
Williams intimated that there were a couple more
chemists to put through their facings at once, and more
evidence is being collected against others who are
adopting the plan of getting rich quickly by living on tne
other fellow’s reputation.

The process of handling and treating ores has
made a great advance in the few years just passed. The
change has been in the direction of handling low grade
ore in large quantities, and making a closer saving than
was formerly possible. In the early days the miner was
compelled to place his reliance upon the relatively small
and scarce bodies of high grade ore. The 'change
mentioned above has enabled him to turn his attention
from these relatively scarce deposits of high-grade ore to
those of greater extent and corresponding number, viz;
the low-grade deposits. The handling of a large body of
low-grade is a safe commercial venture and one now
eagerly sought for. Any improvement in mining and
milling machinery now made is with the idea of utilising
those deposits and the handling of these low-grade ores is
now the most important problem engaging the attention
of mining men. The process of concentration is of such
great importance in the various processes of ore treat-
ment, that any real and practical improvements in the
methods or machines used for the purpose, should be
entitled to close and impartial attention of those
interested. In this connection the Wilfley Concentrator
has proved itself to be a machine of the first order of
merit and the rapidly increasing sales proves that the
mining men in Australia are quite alive to its merits.
Over 600 tables have already been sold in Australia, and
the Austral Otis Engineering Company of South Mel-
bourne, who are the Sole Agents and Manufacturers, are
kept fully employed in making the tables.*

British manufacturers have been beaten in an
open competition by an Australian engineering firm. We
have ascertained that the Mond Gas Co. of Staffordshire
have accepted the tender of Mephan Ferguson, of Mel-
bourne, for the supply of about 13 miles of Ferguson’s
Patent Lockingbar Steel Pipes, from 18 inches to 36 inches
diameter. The machinery for manufacturing these pipes
has all been made at Ferguson’s General Engineering
Works, Footscray, and shipped to Tipton, in Staffordshire,
where the branch works are being erected. The same
firm have also erected engineering and pipe works at
Wanganui, New Zealand, and have contracted to supply
the Wanganui Borough Council with about 20 miles of
Spiral Riveted Steel Pipes for the town water supply.*

Neither the increase in income nor the increase in the
amount added to funds has been quite up to the level of re-
cent years ; nevertheless, in both respects very substantial
progress has been made, and it has moreover been accom-
panied by a substantial reduction in the expense rate,
which is a matter of very considerable importance.
The total funds in the ordinary branch now
amount to £774,578. This is independent of the
company’s capital, which is, for some reason or other,
included among the liabilities of the industrial branch.
That is to say, the business of that branch is charged
with dividend (£2000) at the rate of 10 per cent.
The funds earn only a little over 4 per cent.,
so that about 6 per cent, on the capital has to
come out of the industrial profits, while the
ordinary department goes scot free—at least no
dividend charge is disclosed in that department. The
last, and apparently only, time when there was such a
charge was in 1901, when both departments were charged
with £2OOO, or 10 per cent, each on the total capital.
It would be just as well if it were made clear that there
are no dividends included among “net expenses” in
the ordinary branch’s revenue account.)
The figures for the other branch of the Citizens’
business show considerable improvement in some respects
and fair improvement in others :

The funds of this department, including the £20,000
capital, now amount to £370,682. Claims under indus-
trial policies are remarkably erratic. For a few years
prior to 1903 they appear to have been under the
normal; last year they approached more nearly what
looks like the normal, with the result that the additions

While do l u lt; { wdl be hardl A' worth their
Ahile to take much further interest in the co.’s

they are concerned, just where they were. Practically all
that has been done that concerns them is that something
definite has been arranged with regard to the annual
deficiency—it is to mount up at 5 per cent, compound
interest. Not an ounce of the old burden is removed ;on
the contrary, it seems to have been" made more certain
that, sooner or later, the line and works will fall into the
hands of the debenture holders, unless the co. has some
stroke of luck of which at present there is no sign ; while,
even if foreclosure can be averted, the chances of there
being anything for the ordinary shareholders after the 8
per cent, preference shares (4 per cent, cumulative) have
been satisfied look too remote to be worth considering.
The figures that follow show the surplus of earn-
ings on the railway over working expenses :

Working expenses include nothing for renewal of rolling-
stock, which is now becoming necessary ; so that the real
improvement is not -so good as the figures indicate.
Moreover, as to the amount available to pay interest,
&c., the figures must, of course, be considered in con-
junction with the gradual increase in debenture capital
shown above. As to the ordinary shareholders, their
position is like this :
Net earnings in 1903 £17,654
Earnings after paying for renewals, <&c... 15,493
Rent and Interest on Debentures.. .. 20,374
Amount to pay Preference Shares, 8 p.c. 8,000
Amount by which Surplus must increase
before “ ordinaries ” can get 2£ p.c. 19,381
And, of course, with every deficiency in rent and
debenture interest added to the principal debt, the
amount by which the present surplus of earnings over
working expenses must increase will grow larger ; thus
through the £4BBl added last year to the debt, another
£245 must be earned net before the “ ordinaries ” can get
a bite. And by 1911 another £7OOO a year must be
added, as the sinking-fund provision will then come into
operation ; so that from that year the surplus must be
£42,119, or about three times more than it was last year,
before the “ ordinaries ” will get even 2J per cent. It
must, by 1911, reach £35,619 before even the prefer-
ence shareholders get paid. And the longer the look-in
is delayed, the more hopeless the prospect becomes on
account of the cumulative provisions now attached to
debentures, lessors’, and preference-share interests.

And at this point the association decided that it could no
longer carry on, and resolved to go into liquidation. The
co. still holds properties set down in the balance sheet at
£80,041, but on the basis of last year’s transactions they
do not appear to be worth more than £61,200. If the
difference between the real and the book values of the
remaining properties is the same as the difference
between the two values of the properties realised last
year, then the whole of the capital is lost and about
£4500 besides. If the mortgages (£15,493) are not worth
20s. in the £ then the loss is greater. On the experience
of the previous seven years the result would be a good
deal less satisfactory than that; in order to reduce the
liabilities by £14,606, the assets were reduced on paper
by £34,730 ; but this included payment of 3 per cent,
interest on deposits, which still amount to £56,734. How-
ever it is viewed it is clear enough that all the capital
has gone and something else as well, though how much it
is as yet impossible to say. Apart from amounts owing
to depositors, the principal liabilities are in respect of
balances owing on properties, £26,309.

The paid capital is now £75,000, against £69,000 six
months ago. Profits show a very serious falling away.
Without any writing-off for wear and tear they were
equal to only £8 13s. 2d. per cent, per annum on
shareholders’ total funds (capital and reserves) as at
the commencement of the half-year, as compared
with £ll 18s. Id. in the preceding term; and
that term showed figures far poorer than its
predecessors.. With a reasonable amount written off
for depreciation, the actual return would probably be
something under 5 per cent. The reserves consist
of—lnsurance reserve £44,000, reserve for depreciation
£44,000, and replacement £7500 ; practically, all is used
in the business—the total investments apart from the
business amount to only £8622. A satisfactory feature is
that the co. continues to expand its business entirely
wkh its own money, and maintains a small credit bal-
ance ; an unsatisfactory one is that steamships, buildings,
plant, debentures—every thing, in fact, that the co. owns—
are still included in the balance sheet at cost price, which,
considering the habit things have of deteriorating and
wearing out, is not likely to be the actual value by a
good bit. The reserves shown above are, therefore, de-
scribed as nominal, pending something that looks like a
reasonable writing-down for depreciation.

The present co. took over the goodwill, as shown above,
at £40,000 ; this amount it is writing down steadily, and
has now reduced it to £34,000. A better profit is shown
for the year, notwithstanding a considerable reduction
in earnings :
„ . 1902. 1903.
Earnings .. .. £139,797 .. £118,530
Running expenses .. 89,362 .. 67,087
In 1901 the running expenses amounted to 46 per cent, of
earnings ; in 1902 to 64 per cent. ; last year to 56* per
cent. In 1902 the profits were equal to 36£ per cent, of
the earnings \ last year to per cent, of the earnings.
This, of course, is without making any allowance for de-
preciation. These figures don’t, somehow, seem to square
with the theory that Australia is rapidly becoming a worse
place for the capitalist. The net return (profit less
depreciation) was in 1902 at the rate of £7 17s. per cent. •
in 1903, £8 4s. per cent. The writings-off for depreciation
seem very liberal; in 2 years 8 months £56,722 has been
written off steamers, plant, etc., or equal to about one-
sixth of their total cost. The undivided profit is goino-

for *- he past half-year is stated above at

this bonus is paid are very nearly the same as thev were
for the corresponding half of 1902-3; in the half-year to
January 31st, 1903, they were £7267, and in the past half-
year, £7247. Still it is worth while noting, especially in
view of the recent protest with regard to the expense of
management, that this'striking similarity has only been
achieved by writing considerably less off furniture, pre-
mises extension, &c., during the past half-year. The
progress of things can be best shown, perhaps, by bring-
ing the figures for the August-January half-years
together J

These working expenses are exclusive of bonuses voted
by shareholders to staff. The figures don’t vary much,
but the small variation that there is is not in favor of the
latest half-year—looking at the matter from the share-
holders’ point of view. Still, expenses do not seem high ;
they were at the rate of 2s. llfd. per £ of cash receipts
in the past half-year, as against 3s. Ifd. five years ago.
On the turnover, profits are almost stationary. To
January 31st, 1896, the net profit was £7 18s. 3d. per
cent; it is now £7 16s. 4d. The paid capital is £6997 ;if
that were made the basis of reckoning, the profit would
be dazzling.

The society begins with a splendid business connection.
In a little over eight months its cash receipts have
amounted to £45,599; the Sydney C.S. 00.-op. only-
showed such figures as that after it had been
25 years in existence. So far, of course, the
society merely begins to feel its way. The net
profit amounts to less than 6d. per cent, of the turnover,
as against the Sydney Co-op.’s £8 or so. But the Mel-
bourne society has been doing a vast amount of pre-
liminary- work, which will not have to be repeated ; also,
it has been laying in experience, which is a valuable
asset, though it can’t be shown y-et in the balance-sheet.
Prospects have been reckoned good enough to justify' the
directors in closing for a block of land in Flinders-street
at £10,750 ; now it has to be decided how the balance of
purchase money (£10,000) shall be paid and the land built
upon. Of the capital (£30,000), £22,243 is already called
up ; so that, presumably, there will be a fresh issue,
which will be far better than falling deep into debt for
the purpose. Already, the society has an overdraft of
£1667, and even that is a handicap.

The reserves of this co. move up and down without ex-
planation. In the half-year ending June 30, £467 came
from somewhere, and, as it had been added to the re-
serves, was treated as profit; in the past half-year £455
disappeared so.mewhere, and as it is represented that
the co. is that much worse off, the amount is treated as
loss. If the profit and loss account were followed the
figures showing net profit would be

Even without the unexplained disappearance, therefore,
the half-year’s dividend of 6 per cent, on' the capital of
£200,000 was not quite earned. On shareholders’ funds
(capital and reserve) the profit (£5516) was at the rate of
£4 16s. 6d. per cent, per annum, which isn’t bloated
enough to suggest that the engineering industry has any
too much Protection so far.

Broken Hill feels better than it has done for
three years, and it doesn’t feel very well even now. The
firmer lead market has helped ; but the recent improve-
ments in the metal-extraction processes are the most
cheerful feature. The success of the magnetic separation
of the Junction North’s ore has put some heart into the
holders of shares in the northern group—Junction,
Junction North, and North. Victoria Broken Hill has
looked up, too ; but for. the present it is a gamble pure
and simple. It isn’t a mine yet; it is only a “ position ”
prospect. As to the results from the magnetic concen-
tration of the Junction North parcel, compare the
recoveries in the concentrates with those got by ordinary
concentration at the southern mines :

B.H. Block 14’s managing direotor (Edward

Australian Government Assayer Goyder, he has contrived
a separator which, w'orking apparently in connection
with the acid process, has got out 90 per cent, of the zinc
contents. If they can do that outside the laboratory, it
will be about twice as good a result as the magnetic
separators are accomplishing.

Lo. (Vic.). Stock has been bought and hoarded for the
past month by New Dempseyites, who have other
interests at Stirling. Just as Grant Meudell lost the
company, so may Gilpin lose it. Dealing in shares is
lively, but it is a game of the ins and outs. The outs are
believed to hold two-thirds of the scrip, and the ins fear
the fate of their directors. A clean sweep of all officials
is contemplated by the outs when they get the chance.

Somehow, the public doesn’t take to Jubilee,
Scarsdale (Vic.). The mine is well worked, and not a
farthing is. wasted. As for market, there is none. No. 10
is the mainstay just now, but crosscuts are going in.
below that. Present yield is under lOdwt., and directors
hope to resume monthly shilling dividends. Perhaps the
reason of the mistrust of the show is a doubt as to
whether the gold will carry down. The bottom crosscut
should help to settle that matter.

It’s odds on that the action in which John
Brandon, legal manager of the Great Central Freehold
Mines, sued O. W. Chapman and John Higgins for £3333,
balance of £5OOO said to be due on the purchase of 20,000
shares in the Great Central, will go to the Privy Council.
The Full Court would not permit Chapman and Higgins
to acquit themselves of the liability on the plea of
misrepresentation, so, unless they do go to the Privy
Council, they will have to pay. Both are wealthy, and
bull-necked in their stubbornness.

HUSBAND : “ Wifesh tol' me be sure posh lettersh."
This is how a Melbourne man (per daily
paper advt.) threatens his wife
I F Mrs. Hart does not return within 3 days, will be
J- obliged to have housekeeper. W. D. Hart.
A rather numerous husband is now await-
ing the attentions of a Melbourne jury. The
gentleman married in January, 1894, and the
following April faded away to that abode of grass
widowers, “ the West.” In ’96 his wife thought
it time to look him up, and found him married to
No. 2. For this he got five months, which seems
very moderate. Last week he was charged once
move with bigamy at Port Melbourne having
wedded No. 3 last November. He told the court
that, having been away from his real wife for
seven years, he thought he had a right to marry
again; also, that he reckoned the five months
imprisonment equivalent to a divorce and a general
clearing up. As the third wife assured the court
ahe knew all about his miscellaneous habits, and
was quite content to be No. 3, there doesn t seem
to be any damage done beyond the wasting or
much good coin in marriage fees. But the Judge
who tries the case may think differently. Some
Judges do think differently.

Rum was closely associated with the St.
Patrick’s Days of early Botany Bay and its
dependencies. On the very first anniversary of
Patrick a convict was caught thieving a jorum,
and for the offence was led fty a halter around
the settlement and given three dozen on the bare
back. On the same day a boy gulped a few
mouthfuls out of the doctor’s rum bottle and wB5
promptly given 100 lashes, and a woman got fifty
tor a similar offence.

Some remarks about South Australian
liquor, made at a recent inquest, are worth public
“ AUhehiquest on Isabella Stewart, who died on Sun.
day at Port Adelaide from burns, the police witnesses
stated that they found a bottle labelled Old Red.
Sub-inspector Doyle stated that the wine referred to
was a cheap wine, and that it almost drove unfortunate
Tailors out of their mind. The Government Analyst
stated that the wine contained 3379 per cent, of proof
gnirit, equal to 15£ per cent, of absolute alcohol.
P The coroner, in summing-up, commented very severely
on the matter. He mentioned the name of the
stated that a man committed suicide at East ArteiaiOe,
and left a letter, which was put in as evidence, to the
effect that the act was caused by drinking wine made by
that firm. A man who manufactured such stuff should
be scorned by all honest tradesmen.
Being “scorned” by other tradesmen is likely to
do a vast amount to put down Old Red ;it
promises to be about as effective as looking coldly
on a crocodile, or speaking in severe terms about
Mount Blanc, Surely Jenkins State can devise
something more reliable than scorn as a remedy
for 3379 per cent, of proof spirit !

The North Melbourne Bench lately laid
down the law that when a man marries a lady
who has had a—er— lapse, he is responsible for
the maintenance of her previous mistakes
Seeing that the gentleman in the case had only
married his wife on condition that she got some-
one to adopt the impediment, the Bench* order
to bring the youngster back and rear it as his own
takes himoonsiderably by surprise. Stall, some-
one must support the casual offspring in question,
and the new husband may as well do it as anybody
else. . -
“ Leo ” : There is a certain
Maori settlement at Mania, a little bay
in the Hauraki Gulf (Maoriland),
where about 150 assorted natives grow
fat and live filthy among pippy shells
and unhealthy pigs. The Christian
and moral influence which we are led
to believe has been imparted to and
accepted by Seddon’s dusky children
has not yet reached Mama or other
such places. The people have already
acoepted Mormonism as the only road
to eternity and moral perfection. Ihe
place is visited periodically by a witch
doctor who kills the old and sickly by
commanding them to walk into a creek
up to their necks and stay there halt
the night. He is presented with two
or three young girls in payment for his
service?, and lives like a mid-African
savage until the school-master makes
it too hot for him. This kind of Maori
seems to be quite beyond redemption.
The children are, in some instances,
exceptionally smart, but they return to
semi-savagery as soon as they leave
school, and never practice what they
have been taught.

“ Burglar Bill ” : The old belief
that a low forehead is absolutely
necessary for a successful career in
crime was exploded years ago. The
most dangerous criminal I ever met
had a five inch marble slab above his
eyes, that would have been worth
thousands to him if he had taken to
religion. He wore a 7\ in hats, but
was a small man otherwise. He had
about fifty convictions against him in
other States, yet he was posing as a,
first-timer, sang in the choir, and
turned his noble forehead towards the
narrow path with much determination.
St. Patrick’s Day wasn’t proclaimed a
public holiday in N.S.W. this year, and nobody

Lately Tasmania’s military forces not only
ref used to parade, but added insult to the refusal
by attending in their private capacity and howling
at their general. As a result, the general now
recommends the absolute disbandment of eight
infantry companies and two companies of artillery.
When Australia’s comic army gets tired of soldier-
ing, it calls the general bad names, or clods the
field-marshal, and gets its discharge.
The average Maorilander isn’t nearly so
tired as his Australian brother, but a postal
official at Green Island takes the prize coupon
from all rivals. He achieved notoriety by plant-
ing letters under logs and things, pleading after-
wards that be was really too tired to deliver
them. Missives were found intact except for
ravages of insects. The carrier has been remanded
to the Supreme Court for the cure of his inor-

As a by-issue of the libel suit, Ogier v.
Norton, Melbourne Full Court has decided that
if a lawyer undertakes an action on his own behall

spoiled the full beauty of the decision by refusing
to allow Mr. Lawyer Ogier fees for instructing
himself as to his own case, or calling to see him-
self about his case. Yet an item, “Long and
special consultation with myself when I advised
myself that an action would lie, £2 2s. , would
give a most artistic air to a lawyer-litigants bill

“THE DECLINING BIRTH-RATE."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is said we are immoral, and a wicked, sinful lot,
And a most disgraceful people such as other folks are not;
They are virtuous in England and in Germany ana
France, _ .
And it’s only in Australia that the Devil gets a chance
Let me follow Teece and Ooghlan, let me also have a say
In this storm of wild conjecture which bewilders folks
Can mankind go on increasing ? I reply distinctly—NO l
All the world has fewer people than it had long years
ago!
“Why,” you ask, and very rightly, “why this regular
decline?"
The reply is very simple, it is obvious, reader mine .
Though a pair may have no children —and it doesn b
matter why;
Every child must have two parents 1 That’s a fact you
CAN’T deny.
Those two parents had FOUR parents, which four parents,
’twill be seen
Must have had at least EIGHT parents, which eight
parents had SIXTEEN.
And as clear as mud the fact is—it is absolutely true
That those sixteen parents’ parents must have numbered
THIRTY-TWO.
And those parents’ parents’ parents would, of course, be
SIXTY-FOUR !
Just you keep on counting backwards through the misty
days of yore I
Why the populace in Eden (or arithmetic deceives)
Was ten thousand million Adams and ten thousand
million Eves !
They’d five thousand million Abels and five thousand
But "the °Ca?ns"killed all the Abels, which sufficiently
How the world grew still more empty with the onward
Till "the phrase, “ Declining Birth-rate,” now keeps
ringing in our ears !
You may say I’m talking rubbish as this jingle I indite,
But to talking weary nonsense there is no pre-emptn e
talk about the birth-rate and bewail our hap-
ArenTthe ONLY silly people who can talk alot of rot!

Like the rippling wave of a sunset sea,
Or a chime of bells faint falling,
Was the golden rune of that melody,
With its old-world echoes calling.
And the faded hopes of a bygone day
Were twined in its haunting cadence;
And I dreamed the dreams that had passed away
With a vanished maid of maidens.
And I grieved no more o’er the wasted years ( I
Nor wept for my lost endeavor ;
For anew faith rose, as the sun appears
When the night and the morning sever.
My faint heart leaped to the joyous hymn,
The woes of the twilight scorning;
The end had come of the vigil grim,
And my soul sang, “ Lo, ’tis morning 1 ”

Kangaroo Island (S.A.), the home of the
Uomeite family which has just let its baby die
rattier than call in a doctor or give it medicine, on
the plea that if the Lord wanted it to live it
wouldn t die, is just the sort of place whence
cranky notions might be expected. Probably this
island was occupied earlier than any other part of
i, } whalers certainly had stations there
about as soon as Adelaide was settled, if
not sooner. And it is just about as civi-
lised now as it was then, and very little
more populated. Voliva’s alleged yarn that 30
families are going to quit Kangaroo Island for Zion,
is a palpable flam ; 30 distinct families couldn’t be
scraped off the whole island. Except barley-
growing on a small scale the place has no settled
industry, and doesn’t seem likely to get any; and,
except in the case of three or four specially-favored
tamihes, the life is as rough as any that is lived in
Australia. In the southern half of the island the
only signs of civilisation are finger-posts and pro-
vision-boxes maintained by the Marine Board to
help people who may become shipwrecked on a
wild and utterly desolate shore, where shipwrecks
have been pretty numerous. From part of the
northern coast S. Australia gets a good deal of its
hsh supply ; but the few islanders don’t fish, and
the fashermen who run down the gulf from Glenelg
and Adelaide rarely land. Most settlers, inter-
marrying as these have done, would drift into
ordinary savagery under similar conditions: but
there was a strain of emotional “religiousness”
about several of the original families, and “Dowie-

the witness, and gibbering of
the witness at the interpreter,

on the shady side of a profit-bearing
purrant-bush for the remainder of
their days. It is commonly sup-
posed that the first thought
of the retrenched civil ser-
vantis to go “on the

Some preposterous top notes of Tory
alarm have been sounded by the Melbourne mer-

Horrors of Socialism are said to be threatening
the Bulwarks of Liberty, also the fate of Property
is trembling in the balance, and the Progress of
the Community is Menaced by the mischievous
adherents of Maloney. The Labor party is
devastating the sacred plains of Commerce, and
ruin can only be averted by a desperate Rally of
Respectability on behalf of the Lord Mayor.
Those Melbourne merchants are doing their best
to curdle the blood of Patriotism. A rabid
individual named Scarlett has warned all True
Citizens to expect the worst should M'Eacharn
be defeated. This is what will happen to Mel-
bourne if Socialism puts Scarlett and co. to confu-
sion : “People with money, who keep things
going, will leave and spend their money else-
where, and mansions at Toorak will be for sale at
the same prices as ordinary seven-roomed villas. ”
And vile socialists will rent them on degrading
terms ! Also the Bunyip will wander up and
down a desolated Collins-street, and the flying-fox
will smell high in the Exhibition Building, and
where the Sydney express used to start from
Spencer-street station nothing will start except
the hyaena going out at night to look for bones.

“ Chasselas ” on a religious matter :
Victorian churches are on the warpath, trying to saddle
the school teachers with the responsibility of teaching
the kiddies Bible lessons. Know a country State school
only a gunshot from the manse, and though several
parsons have been in charge during the last 15 years,
none have availed themselves of the privilege of teaching
Scripture after school hours. The holy stirrers-up of
sectarian strife are taking a sort of fool vote in Victorian
towns, and announce big majorities in their favor all over
the State. But when Tommy Bent suggests a referendum
on the question, the clerical wrigglers howl against it in
a way suggestive of something wrong with their so-called
majorities. The secular system of education is blamed
for the irreverence of Australian youths. Perhaps
that irreverence is much more due to the encourage-
ment by the clergy of pushing evangelical Yankee bag-
men, who introduce religion (as they would their wooden
nutmegs) with nigger jokes and parodies on sacred
hymns and impudent familiarities with Divine persons
and things. The average Australian has a keen sense of
humor, and the Yankee hymns, nigger coon songs, and
general gospel of hustle and hair oil, are too much for
him at present.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, March 22, 1904.
My Dear Arini.—
A Sydney-sider returned from a visit to Mel-
bourne remarks upon the great amount of enter-
taining-indoor, or in gardens—done by society
and sub-society in that capital. At homes, after-
noon teas, dinners, dances, riding parties, chase
each other or run concurrently. Melbourne’s
forces are more consolidated than those of Sydney
and its natural-beauty places on the coast-line
difficult of access (and for that matter not much
worth accessing). So the entertainers are more
dependent on each other than are Sydney
people who take their pleasure out-door in
launches on the harbor, or at Port Hacking and
the beautiful National Park river. The Mel-
bournian thinks nothing of stopping in Melbourne
all tlie year round and entertaining without
regard to season. The Sydneysider—everyone
who can rake together a few pounds—goes away
to M.L., or to Tasmania, or to the Mountains,
for from one month to four. At Easter the
Sydney woman wakes up, and is more or less
awake—generally less—until the end of July,
when she drowses again until it is time to get up
and see about frocks for the Spring races.
Melbourne seems to be a cheerful place
to live in just now for one “in society,” if
many of the entertainers are like the Ross-
Sodens (she was a Tyson legatee) who live
in Mandeville Hall (formerly the residence
of the Joseph Clarkes). At a recent Ross-
Soden “At home” the usual programme of
dancing, billiards, bridge, and cooing in the
conservatory was enriched by a “ memory-
table” in the morning-room. Something under
a hundred articles were spread upon the table,
and those who wished to “memorise” and try for
a prize were admitted in detachments (and in
dead silence), and allowed a two minutes’ study
of the table. Afterwards the students wrote
down the names of as many of the articles as they
could remember. The Forrest lady, with her
alert brain, scored as usual. She recollected
nearly everything on the board, and took first
prize, a beautiful white ostrich feather fan with
mother-of-pearl sticks. This gift idea is all right
for the guests, but what sort of a notion must the
hosts have of themselves when they reckon they
need a “ draw ”of that sort ? It’s bringing social
affairs down to the level of the “ popular ” city
churches.
The academic, the bagpipe and the musical
sections of our community combined to give Miss
Lilian Foulis a hearty reception on her first
Australian appearance, on Saturday night at
Sydney Town Hall. Whatever the last may
think of her musicking, the first (headed by Dr.
MacLaurin) and the second (the Highland Society)
had probably prejudged her merits, when she
talked to them in a pretty brown-heath-and-heather
little brogue, as one whose music would surely be
something finer than the bagpipes—if such were
possible. It was excellent music—sometimes for the
space of a few heart-beats it was exquisite; but the
widely-advertised comparison with Lady Halle is
hardly judicious. However, Miss Foulis possesses
the advantages of youth and a magnificent fiddle,
and everything may be hoped and even expected
for her.
In the matter of appearance she does herself in-
justice. Like so many tall girls she droops her
head forward from the nape of the neck and
thrusts out her chin. This applies, of course, to
non-fiddling moments, but there is no reason
why she shouldn’t carry herself proudly and be
art-like from forehead to feet. She has
uncommon eyes like those of Swinburne’s
“Felice” —and nice hair that would stand the
Crossley style of dressing, but which at present
is crammed down as if it were of no account.
Mrs. Fitzgerald’s notes are always as welcome
as rain in a parched land—especially the high
ones. Her gown—a green chiffon over white and
strapped with chiffon velvet—was most successful.
In a Sydney separation case, lately dragging its
distracted length through the divorce courts, the
petitioning wife alleged that her husband threat-
ened to hire an Irishwoman to beat her every
morning, “in order to set her up for the day”—
I suppose he meant to knock her down for the
day. I don’t know whether to be more impressed
by the weariness of the man who proposed to
thrash his wife by deputy, or by the insult to
Erin embodied in the proposal to engage an Irish-
woman for the business. I have read somewhere
that in Corea no gentleman beats his wife person-
ally ; the lady is caned by an upper servant under
the husband’s supervision, and ne languidly waves
bis pipe, or his hat, or the cruet-stand, or some-
thing, as a sign to the servant to leave off when
be considers his helpmate has been sufficiently
bruised. I don’t know what truth there may be
in this story, but Corea seems tired enough fpr it
to be a fact.
Mrs. See, the wife of State Premier John See
who died last week, had been ill for nearly a year,
though not confined to her house for that period.
A complication of diseases beset the poor lady,
and of late she suffered greatly. Mrs. See was a
Miss Matthews, and stepdaughter of Mr. Kid-
man, a Sydney provision merchant. She had
considerable private means, and had a pretty taste
in old ivory, lace, and china, and possessed some
fine diamonds. Seven of Mrs. See’s ten children
survive her. One daughter is married to Mr. Sam
Hordern. Youngest daughter, Lily, is one of the
acknowledged beauties of Sydney. State Premier
See (with a son and daughter) was in Maoriland
at the time of his wife’s death, and Acting-
Premier Wise had to cable the grievous news.
Our old friend, Lady Hopetoun, is described by
the society salaamer in M. A.P. as being “ a very
pretty woman with large, blue eyes.” Wonder
what she has done with the very dark optics she
used when in Australia ? Besides, Lady Hopetoun
isn’t “ pretty.” She may be handsome, which is
much better than “pretty.” The last named
adjective ought not to be projected at a really
tall woman.
Concerning the riding masculine-fashion of some
girls in the recent polo-gymkhana at Melbourne.
The innovation is practised in some very toney
circles in England. A recent magazine article
had illustrations of various “ county ” ladies who
are “masters of hounds.” One of the pictures
showed “Mrs. Cheape (who owns and hunts
her own packs) and her daughters ready for
a start.” I looked from the picture of six
mounted figures to the printed phrase and back
again in wonder. There was obviously one
lady in the group. She wore a riding-habit and a
matronly outline. The object back of her was
obviously a groom with side-whiskers, so the four
young persons in riding-breeches, short coats, and
boxer hats must have been Mrs. Cheape’s
daughters. They looked like nice (very plump-
legged) boys, and they rode as boys ride, and
didn’t dally with the divided-skirt compromise.
Most of these changes are for the better. If the
goose’s saddle presently becomes extinct ’twill be
because the gander’s saddle is better for the goose.
Miss Lili Sharp, a Victorian phenomenon who
went Londonward some short time ago, is now
Mrs. Rafalewski. Doesn’t the name suggest a
jungle-like head of hair and finely-frenzied eyes?
Mr. Raf. is said to be a pianist.
To what devices the lack of dress-pockets has
driven women ! In S.M.H.’s “Lost Dog” column
appeared an advt. from a Strathfield lady offering
a reward for the recovery of her garter, “con-
taining two sovereigns and some jewellery.”
What about opening her “purse” in a public
thoroughfare? Did she —but the rush of sur-
mises is smothering.
A new misery has fallen upon the telephone
subscriber; that of having a trumpet—an ice-
cream man’s trumpet evidently—blown in her ear
whilst she is speaking to her dearest friend in a
distant suburb. Every telephoner must have
noticed and bad - worded the annoyance. I
haven’t solved the mystery of that trumpet. Who
blows it, and why ?
A tame season is ahead of us. The British
fleet will not be back until after the Show, so it
will also miss the first day’s racing and a big
dance to be given by 30 unmarried hostesses. At
least the frisk-givers will miss the fleet, for the
gold-strapped merman is a most important item
in this over-girled community.
I was told lately of a favorite moneyed bachelor
who, five years ago, secured the portraits of 48 girl
friends of his—all nice good-looking girls whose
fathers are of this or that “ learned profession ”
panelled one side of his library with them, and
waited for the originals to marry. He is waiting
yet (to give a wedding present, I suppose), but
not one of the 48 has changed her maiden state.
My informant said that the girls are all North
Shore residents. Which I don’t believe.
Alice Hollander tells an interviewer of her
matrimonial engagement to a Mr. Tannet Walker,
who at time of interviewing was at college at
Oxford. She met him whilst she was singing in
the grey-green town, but does not expect to marry
for some time. Possibly the gentleman is very
young and she intends to wait until he is fully
grown up.
Bondi (Sydney) has a lady barber. Her practice
is restricted to Sundays, and the fee, one shilling,
is, everything considered, not high. A delightfully
spick and span bike with an ingeniously arranged
bag are the outward and visible signs of her
calling. Those who happen to be on her calling
list say that she is a veritable artist, and cheerfully
pay a shilling for the Sunday shave.
Lily Titheradge, interviewed by the Plater,
tells that she has two sisters on the stage and two
engaged to be married. She herself married some
few years ago a medical student. Her father has
almost given up daffodils in favor of golf. Mrs.
Henry Bracy has one of the prettiest flats in
London, and her two sons are getting bn well
towards stardom.
Miss Isabel Abercrombie Duff, daughter of
N.S.W. ex-Governor Duff, is engaged to be
married to Mr. Ronald Malcolm, of Walton
Manor, Epsom, England.
A fashionable audience at first night of
“Two Mr. Wetherbys” at the Criterion. Pure
merino men and women all over the house —even
the galleryites looked like aides-de-catnp and
Government House debutantes. Tlje Austin
family were in force in the stalls to hearten their
relative, Miss Winifred Austin, who takes the
part of Margaret, the younger Mrs. Wetherby.
She wears her clothes with an air of distinction,
and carries herself gracefully, and speaks well,
and her back view when she’s indignant (which
is nearly always) is like that of the offended wife
in Orchardson’s “First Cloud.”
Such sighs—for the days that are no more—
went up from all the female Pointers when they
read of the military Dangar’s special presentation
to the King. ■ He used to be the best-liked man
(by women) in Sydney, and was a fat, good-
natured, accomplished chappy, with a hobby for
amateur theatricals.
Grace Jennings Carmichael, who used to write
pretty verses for the Australasian, has died in
London of pneumonia. She had quite a vogue
amongst mothers and girls with the maternal
instinct, for her theme was always childhood-
children’s quaint sayings, their joys and tears and
deaths, and the rounded limbs of babyhood, one
was a Gippslander, and her little muse was at its
best during the years she was a nurse at the
Children’s Hospital in Melbourne. Some 10
years ago she married a Mr. Mullis and went to
England. With the arrival of her babies (five
children survive her), the inspiration to poetise
over babyhood would seem to have flickered out.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent: —
“ At a distance the Yarra ‘ Henley ’ revels on
Saturday had a deceptive air of gaiety and joy.
The enchantment faded with a nearer approach.
There it was seen that the Yarra was the same old
Yarra, with the same defunct dog, the same debris
and the same—alas! —the same whiff. Though flags
were flying from Princes Bridge to the Morgue,
though there were quite six ‘house-boats,’ (which
looked like slightly glorified editions of the Boot
Trunk which Thekkla Dubberke knew about),
though society had mustered in force and had
brought its strongest scents, still Henley-on-Yarra
wasn’t far enough removed from the idea of
Revels-on-a-Drain to suggest pleasure.
“ Thousands of folks lined the sloping banks
(carpeted in spaces), or walked under the elms, or
clustered in the house-boats, while the race-skiffs
shot over the prescribed course and the pleasure-
boats plied to and fro—all with more or less
farcical effect. The least dingy of the river
kennels was that flying the ’Varsity colors. But
fashion concentrated on the more spacious boot-
box of Mesdames Buckley, Landale and Fairbairn.
From this, Miss Landale, in beauteous attire,
looked out as a pictured belle might from a very
shabby frame. Near by, the balconied house-boat
of the Vice-regals flew the flag of great rejoicing.
The M'Eacharns, the Fitzgibbons, and sundry
callers, circled about the greater Exes, and the
local Waxellency. The most suitably accoutred
were Mrs. Mollison and Miss Muriel Cumming.
They both wore blue and white, the latter in
strict boat-dress style. Miss Landale was too
sumptuous for a small wherry; she needed a
gondola.
“ Intense interest was taken by a big batch of
bank promenaders in the afternoon tea consump-
tion on the leading barge, and as the elect drained
their cups the onlookers gave grim smiles. The
fact was that someone was espied a short time
before the kettle boiled rinsing the cups in the
stream of much departed doggie.
“ All alone —as the Scriptural sparrow on the
house-top—sat an influential Society leader at the
Yarra revels on Saturday, just because the aides
had neglected to summon her to the Northcote
presence. Invitations to the lesser house-boats
were ignored, and she’sat with her indignation
tightly laced in on the grassy slopes with the
great Unimportant.
“An extraordinary point of law has just been
settled. A young, orphaned bride expended a
large sum of money on her ceremonial trappings
and trousseau. The marriage went off as expen-
sively as she pleased. A few years passed, and
her trustee found himself charged with remissness,
neglect of duty, and other lawless things in per-
mitting an appalling sum to be spent by his charge
in an unwarranted manner. He was reminded by
the lady that he should stand the brunt of such
folly. Lawyers’ letters followed pointing out the
law on the point, and finally, after the distracted
trustee had consulted an authority, the sum
demanded was paid up by him—this being con-
sidered a cheaper thing than law proceedings.
But he wasn’t smart enough by half for such an
emergency. He should have sent in a contra
account claiming the full value of all the wedding
presents, and so on, attracted by the expensive
ceremony.
“ How does Toorak find out what a Vice-regal
lady favors in the way of underwear, or the
quality of the sheets she actually sleeps in ? Who
first had the temerity to finger the pillow-covers,
and peep into the trunks, and dilate with an air
of authority on the ‘ exquisite texture ’ and the
‘ monograms ’ that are woven into various gar-
ments ? At present, Toorak talks of little else
but the cobweb finery of the lady’s hidden cloth-
ing and dream-garb, and other intimate dress-
matters.
“An interesting person at present anchored in
this port is Mr. Bert Nicholson, the one-time
representative of Whitaker Wright. In Mel-
bourne young Nicholson had a reputation as a
boxer and an all-round athlete. Then he suc-
ceeded to a snug billet as business manager in
Westralia for an aristocratic English dame.
Later he caught the attention of W. Wright and
became his representative in outpost work.
“Hundreds steamed off London-wards last
Tuesday; the German liner had a complement of
200 more than crowded the Orontes.
“ Miss Inez Bensusan is keeping her end of the
stick up abroad. She is elocuting at ‘At Homes, ’
interviewing Stars, and penning original yarns.
A recent story from her in the London Referee
is a little bit startling.
“ Mrs. Bulky-Johnson has arrived —a tall, grand
personage, with a figure and the art of wearing
clothes.
“News comes that Baronet Clarke’s wife
whizzes round in the most gorgeous motor that
any Londoner boasts. Mayfair and grass-widow-
hood certainly have their consolations.
“ Young Rep. Kelly is welcomed to the Toorak
fold, and takes his petting quietly. Mr. Kelly
does the Block in a new-fashioned coat, by which
he takes the eye of the peripatetic charmer; and
if useful Acts of Rarliament followed on the lines
of trousers-creases, and a bold style in shirts was
the mark of a progressive mind, Mr. William
Kelly would be a useful addition to the Legis-
lature.
“ The military son of Mr. Nicholas Fitzgerald
(of the beerage) is making the most imposing
match scored by any Australian to date. Lady
Constance M'Kenzie is said to have an income of
£60,000 a year, a lot of exalted Scottish connec-
tions, and unrivalled personal qualities as a sport.
And, what is more to the clannish heart of papa
Nicholas, the religious nature of the alliance
(alliance is the due term) is satisfactory.
“ Miss Margaret Baskerville, who takes the
lion’s share of wall and pedestal space in the
current Yarra Society Exhibition, sails to Europe
immediately, to study sculpture in Paris, London,
and elsewhere. Up to date her highest achieve-
ment is an original work ‘The Sea-Urchin.’ In
the same show, Dpuglas Richardson’s ‘ Discovery
of Gold in Victoria,’ dwarfs all other efforts in
statuary.
“ One or two Federal Ministers are, not to put
too fine a point upon it, henpecked. On a recent
occasion, when one department broke out (as it
does annually) on a Saturday junket, the Minis-
terial chief excused his absence and put forth the
shame-faced explanation that his wife, who was
denied much of his company during the week,
required his devoted attendance from Saturday
till Monday.
“The idea that the widow of Graham Berry
is a feeble old lady is erroneous. She was
quite 25 years her husband’s junior, and has
preserved a youthful complexion and a very
bright manner. You don’t forget, even now,
that this second wife of the departed politician
was a beauty in her youth. The youngest Berry
daughter is in school frocks still, and inherits the
good looks of both parents.
“At the theatrical carnival, the comic-opera
cricket girls—round of cheek and upstanding of
figure—fearlessly faced the searching sunshine, in
frank hats and simple skirts, topped by sweaters.
The daylight comeliness of said charmers came as
a slap in the face to the sort of woman who
habitually argues that stage-beauty is merely a
matter of make-up, and that outside the limelight
the belle of the boards stands a haggard wreck.
Some people forget that the chorus girl is chosen
from a crowd of applicants—chosen for her form
and features—and that the powers of make-up
are limited. It emphasises the charms of Beauty,
but would scarcely be capable of disguising the
defects of Frump.
“Evelyn Scott (Nan, in the ‘Country Girl’)
scored belle-honors among the Trump Queens,
who dispensed tent-tea. Prettier off the stage
than on, she tripped to and fro, a smiling Hebe,
creamy of complexion, hazel as to eyes and hair.
Slung coquettishly by a strap over the shoulder of
her smart, woolly white coat, she wore a sporty
money-bag. Florence Young, smart and ‘ correct ’
in brief-skirted black, had an upstanding cockade
in her soldierly hat. Celia Ghiloni, also in all-
black, sported a different build of millinery—
a Gainsbro’ structure with white tulle strings.
Outside, George Lauri, in immaculate top-hat
and frock-coat, smoked a fat cigar and paced
along earnestly as if anxious to let the crowd
see that he was a more comely fellow than might
be apparent in the more comic disguises to come
later. Reginald Roberts, on the other hand,
capered all the afternoon, his nose painted scarlet,
and his scalp planted with red-tufts.
‘‘ On the concert platform. Rose Musgrove, as
a doll, affected short white-muslins and frilly
pantalettes, threaded with blue ribbons. Lauri,
her doll-partner, was a broad-shouldered ‘little
Lord Fauntleroy,’ in scarlet-sashed black-velvet,
and complexion like a red sunset. Maurice
Dudley’s ‘ Mdlle. Bartho,’in next-to-no-skirt and
quantities of rose-tights, would have shocked the l
eye of Purves, K.C., who said in court, t’other
day, that gilded youths displaying their ‘ thick
legs ’ at polo sports were far more indecent than
the Mutoscope pictures. Another concert
tion was ‘Rajah’ Bantock, who sang an alleged
comic song in subdued fashion, with his two hands
clasped as usual on his lowest vest button.
“ At the Medical Association’s reception (March
19), in the Pianola Hall, an attractive item was
the singing of graceful Beatrice Miranda.
The guests of the evening were new medical
Professor Osborne and his wife. The new-
comer, who fills the shoes of Dr. Martin (gone
to an English appointment), has done previous
professorial work in Ireland, England, a,nd
on the continent of Europe. Here he (like
his predecessor in office) only gets part of
the emoluments set aside for the Chair,
practically but not nominally filled by him.
Its life-occupant, who did good work in
his day, rests from his labors with a share
of the salary. Sydney ’Varsity is rich as Croesus,
compared with our poor thing. To begin with,
we never had anything to compare with Sydney’s
rich bequests and endowments, and such as we
had were raided by a dishonest official. Thanks
to his schemes, some of the endowments have
practically ceased to exist. At the medical even-
ing, middle-aged doctors compared notes as to the
student-frolics of their youth, and called upon
cheery old Dr. Jamieson to pronounce on the
respective merits of the boys of the past and
present, as viewed by him in his role of lecturer.
The canny Scot declared the case was ‘ one for
consultation.’
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.


GIRLS OF TO-DAY.
-Lhe girl of to-day will bo the woman of to-morrow—and womanhood will make great demands upon her
slender blood-supply. If her blood is not equal to these new demands, her strength and liveliness will be
drained away, and she will slip into chronic ill-health—perhaps into a hopeless decline. Nothing can tide her
safely over the crisis except plenty of pure, rich, strong blood. Her blood is too weak for this strain if she is
pale and languid, if she suffers from dizziness 01 headaches, if her appetite is fickle or her heart disordered, if
she is easily tired, or if a little exertion leaves her breathless. These are the signs that her blood-supply is
over-taxed—these are the first symptoms of that decline which may end in Consul, ption if her blood is not
built up immediately with Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. They actually make new blood. That is
the simple, scientific reason why they carry growing girls safely over their critical time of change, and make
them develop into strong, ruddy, full-breasted young women.
“When I was about 14,” says Miss Florrie Smith,
Harrow Road, Auburn, “ my blood got thin and watery,
and 1 began to suffer from bad headaches. I had pains in
both my sides, which later on spread atl over my body. My
appetite failed, and I could not sleep. My complexion
became yellow, and my gums quite white. I was as
languid as could be, and always wanted to be lolling about.
I lost all interest in life and naturally grew very despon-
dent. I took different medicines, and mother tried to
cure me with simple home re imdies, but none of them did
me any good. For two years I kept getting worse instead
of better, when a, friend advised me to try Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People. As soon as I could, I got some
at Anthony Hordern’s—and I had taken only two or three
boxes when I felt a great deal better. Then I began to eat
heartily, and everyone remarked how pink and rosy my
complexion was. By the time I finished about six boxes I
was as full of health and energy as any girl in Sydney. I
owe my complete return to good health to Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People.”

“ Their Excrescences ” would fit the State
Governors better than “ Their Excellencies.”
DEAIvIN.
A presence fine ; a meaning' good ;
A velvet sheath ; a sword of wood.
C.R.
After all there is one thing for which we
should be grateful to Elijah Dowie. He is about
the only recent misfortune that hasn’t been laid
at the door of “ socialistic legislation.”
No wonder Melbourne hustled Elijah the
Restorer out of the city. It has had Irvine, the
Restorer of Confidence, and it has Bent the
Restorer of Prosperity, and it felt that a third
Restorer was too much.
Rodney Cockburn, one of the reporters on
the staff of Adelaide Register, is a nephew of
Elijah Dowie, and has been offered a good position
in Zion if he will flit from the S.A. oapital to the
other Holy City near Chicago.
The Speck Government has had a windfall
in the probate duty on the estate of the late
v\ illiam Hart, M.L.C. That old Tasmanian
politician left a trifle of £429,240 —-roughly speak-
lug, about one-eightieth of the whole net value of
Tasmania.
Miss Jennings Carmichael (Mrs. Mullis),
just dead, was a sweet singer of small sweet
rhymes. James Brunton Stephens, 10 years ago,
called her “the Jean Ingelow of Australia,” and
tins was a title she confessed to be ever striving
to deserve.
It used to be remarked in Adelaide that,
whereas Senator Chaffey Baker was about the
most unpopular man in the State, he always
managed to get hold of any position he chased
after, and apparently it is to be the same in the
r ederal Legislature.
If Mrs. McDonald, now under sentence of
death, is hanged, she will be the first woman to
go to the scaffold in Queensland for 17 years.
Ellen Thompson was the last; it was husband
murder that time. John Harrison, the third
party, was hanged, too.
The photographs of Irvine and Bent
appear on the front page, and immediately under-
neath the title, of a little Melbourne publication
called “Mmd and Body.” One of those half-
truths that are worse than lies. “Body ”is true
but where, 0 where, is “Mind?”
A TREASURY-DAY SKETCH AT HER
MAJESTY’S, MELBOURNE.
Geelong (Vic.) County Court took half-an-
nour lately to decide whether an “infant ” of 51
was entitled to register his own birth or not.
finally decided in his favor—mercifully, for in
the nature of things that man has not long to live,
and it would be hard for him to die before he was
legally born.
Commonwealth Government has joined
with that of Cape Colony in urging the release of
fjieutenant Witton, sentenced to imprisonment
for life for complicity with the Bush veldt Car-
bineer outrages. Possibly England is keeping
V\ itton in gaol until it hears of the release of the
Six Petnana Hatters from the dungeons of the
Commonwealth.
Minister Perry and Educationist Bridges
of N.S.W. have been decorated by the French
Government for their exertions in adding to the
fund for the Martinique disaster. The school-
children who supplied the money, and who were
morally whipped out of their pennies, are supposed
to be amply rewarded by the glorification of the
pair of posturers at the head of the show.
“ As a matter of fact, Mr. Bent’s claim to
take the leading place among the statesmen of
Victoria can no longer be denied.” So wrote the
editor of a little Yic. weekly, wondering the
while if his readers would stand it. But the
casual compositor made it read “as a matter of
fat, and the rash assertion became a mere plati-
tude to which nobody could take exception.
Elmore : Still the fortunes come. A
f y°m Strathbogie (Vic. j—name,
U ilhaan Gibbs has left for England to collect an
d J° rt , u . n ? v . ar . ious !y estimated at £50,000 or
£ l OO,OOO. which, it is said, five successive ancestors
were too tired to collect. So, presumably, another
inquiring Australian head will shortly be inserted
into the lair of that more or less imaginary beast
called Chancery.
Westralia’s new Auditor-General, C. S.
Toppin, learned his book-keeping at Christy’s—
the London people who make more hats than any-
key Jr se in , e wor ld. He came out from the
Cold Country for the West Australia Land Co.,
passed thence into the railway department, became
accountant, and was then chosen for hisnew billet
from a. couple of hundred applicants at nearly
doubled salary. He is still well under 40.
Bairnsdale (Vic.), on the borders of the
haunts of the mysterious bunyip, boasts an ardent
naturalist, Mr. George, who, when not dissect-
ing insects, or the handicraft of Nature generally,
follows his calling as an horologist. His enthu-
siasm in pursuit of his hobby is unbounded.
That the bunyip has not yet been run to earth
is not his fault, for he has explored the nooks
and crannies of Gippsland to the Back of Beyond
looking for it.
Amongst recently celebrated birthdays was
that of Mr. James Pemell, who on St. Patrick’s
anniversary commenced his 89th year. The old
veteran got to Sydney in the thirties, after having
witnessed thecoronation procession of William IV.
He was a member of the Sydney corporation at
the outbreak of the gold fever, and represented a
Sydney constituency in the Parliament of 1859,
and Canterbury in the Parliament of 1865. At
that time his place of business was in Parramatta-
street, now known as George-street West.
The municipal Council of Hurstville
recently issued assessment notices and adver-
tised the same. Each ward notice is headed
“Original grantee, Robert Townson,” followed
by a list of reputed owners. Robert Townson
was an LL.D., who arrived in Sydney on July 6
1807, in the ship Young William. He came oit
with a written promise of 2000 acres of land,
which Gov. Bligh refused to give him, as he had
no orders. After much correspondence, Townson
got his grant from Gov. Macquarie in 1810.
Died at Greymouth (M.L.) Dr. C. L.
Morice, in his 85th year. He first came to these
parts in the ’so’s, and eventually settled down in
Greymouth in ’64. He was given to a boisterous
manner that was entirely deceptive. His son
married Premier Seddon’s daughter. Seddon
offered him an M.L.C.-ship, which he vigorously
refused. Few drovers could equal his picturesque
expressions on occasion, and that was one of the
occasions. The “old doc.” lived for his profes-
sion, and a doctor who does that leaves many
friends. Often he doesn’t leave much money.
When royalty goes in for being squalid
and indecent, it certainly makes a success of the
work. There was a royal marriage, recently, in
Germany, and it is mentioned as “a striking
feature ” —that is the gentle way the report put it
—that the bride, Princess Marie of Reuss, was
led into the chapel by her brother, the reigning
prince, who is “a totally incurable lunatic.”
Then when the bridegroom saw his ape-like rela-
tive gibbering at him beside the altar, and gam-
boling round the sacred edifice on all-fours, he had
a chance to realise what his wife might become,
and what his children possibly would be like.
“J. A. C.” : T. P.’s Weekly, re-
viewing Plowden’s “Autobiography of a
Police Magistrate,” tells a story of Whistler,
which I do not remember seeing before.
Says Plowden : “ Whistler was the only man
I have ever met in whom personal conceit,
whether real or assumed, was a positive
charm. There was a private view at the
Grosvenor Gallery. Almost the first friend
I met was Whistler, and he very good-
naturedly tqok me up to a full-length portrait
which he was exhibiting of Lady Archibald
Campbell. After I had done my best to ex-
press my humble appreciation, I asked him if
there were any other pictures he would advise
me to look at. ‘ Other pictures! ’ said Whistler,
in a tone of horror. ‘ Other pictures ! There
are no other pictures !’ ”
Everyone connected with Graham
Berry’s embassy to England 25 years ago is
now dead. Berry himself was the last of
the crowd. The Assembly voted £5OOO for
three ambassadors, but only two were ap-
pointed, Berry and Professor C. H. Pear-
son. The “constitutionalists” of Flinders-
lane appointed Henderson Africanus, a black
newspaper-vendor, as the “third ambas-
sador,” and gave him a farewell banquet—
tickets two guineas. The speeches were re-
ported in full by the late Daily Tklegkaph,
and Africanus loftily referred to Berry and
Pearson as “my fellow-ambassadors” and
“ray colleagues.” But the shipping agents
were got at, and refused to give Henderson
a passage in the same steamer with the
Premier and the Professor. There was really
a third man that the public didn’t hear about.
It was Police-Sergeant Mills, who, as Chief
Secretary’s orderly, sat outside Berry’s door and
announced arrivals. When the three got to
London, and did their business —to try and wipe
out the Victorian House of Landlords—Mills
begged “lave to see me peeple, sorr, in th’ ould
sod beyant.” He got the “lave,” crossed the
Irish Sea, and returned to Melbourne with a sod of
turf, a few cuttings of shamrock, some pots of
snake-proof soil and a few other things that he
hoarded at his crib in Melbourne suburbs for the
rest of his days.
A South Coast farm of 20 acres has for
years been profitably worked by three orphan
spinsters. The “baby” has just turned 75. They
dig, chop, milk, sow, reap, slaughter, and do all the
laborious work on their potato patch without any
outside assistance. They are a healthy trio of the
Amazon type, and not even the baby would be
seen in a 40-acre paddock with base man.
A PROPHECY.
“And it came to pass that Elijah , the Pie-
biter, was taken down in a chariot of fire."
Macdonald and his wife, the pair who
killed stepdaughter Grace at Longreach (Q.) by a
gruesome process of slow torture, are both
people with short, thick necks. In a general way
the person with that kind of isthmus between the
head and the rest of him, or her, is worth avoid-
ing.
“ D.J.C.” : Donald Mackintosh, the bril-
liant (?) member for Cambooya (Q.), is a Scots-
man, but liberal to a limit. One day Donald lent
a tarpaulin (for no fixed period) to a friendly
neighbor to throw over his haystack. After a
few months the tarpaulin did not return, and
Mackintosh interviewed the neighbor, who flatly
refused to part with it. Donald sought legal
advice, to no avail. When standing for Parliament
Mac, like the rest, promised all sorts of things
should they “do him the honor.” He received a
shock when some uncouth youth yelled out:
“ Garn, yer can’t get yer own tarpaulin back;
what’ll yer get us ? ” However, Donald was duly
elected, and, among other things, he promised
Pittsmouth (the centre of his electorate) a “bore.”
The place has had a bore ever since, and it
remains for Steele Rudd to shift it next election.
The abandonment of Trial Bay prison,
erected on Daggers Point (whence the
name ?) recalls old contractor Macquarie,
who helped to build the edifice. Mac-
quarie left one bright joke behind him.
He fell into difficulties in his later years,
and once, just as he was about to give
a lavish picnic on board his steam launch
in Sydney harbor, a bailiff came on board
and seized the vessel for debt. The
picnic came off with the bailiff on board.
In the evening the “security ” was left in
the clutches of the law, but Macquarie
started the engine before he got ashore,
and the bailiff, who didn’t know how to
stop th ; machinery, steered the captured
asset in circles about the harbor for four
hours and shrieked for help. It was one
of the most cheerful events which ever
happened on Sydney harbor, but a
humorless court gave Macquarie three months.
Memories of Isaac Nathan, fcomposer of
Byron’s Hebrew Melodies, are recalled in the
death of one of his sons, Henry Lynd Nathan,
and the arrival in Sydney of his granddaughter’
Miss Lilian Foulis. Isaac Nathan came to Sydney
in 1841 and built himself a residence at Rand wick
which he named Byron Lodge, after his friend
and patron, the poet. He was accidentally killed
while getting out of a tram car on the old Pitt-
street tramway in 1863. He left several children.
Dr. Charles Nathan being one. The recently!
deceased Henry Lynd Nathan was godson of
Capt. Lynd, who was Barrack-Master in Sydney
when the military were housed in Wynyard
Square, and the personal friend of Leichhardt,
the explorer. Captain Lynd was a poet of some
note, his elegy on the supposed death of Leich-
hardt being very pathetic. Nathan set the elegy
to music, and the piece was to be given in the old
Victoria Theatre on a certain night, but while
Captain Lynd was dressing for the theatre
Leichhardt turned up at the barracks. The lose-
able explorer went to the theatre and heard his
own elegy sung. A daughter of Isaac Nathan
married Dr. Foulis, of Glebe Point, the vocalist
just arrived being a descendant.
A memorial in bronze is about to be
erected, at the expense of the Maoriland Govern-
ment, to the memory of Hori Grey, in St. Paul’s,

When “Jack” Taverner, now off to
London as Vic. Agent-Genera!, was attending an
agricultural conference in Sydney during his tern*
m the Turner Government, lie took with him
ex pelt Pearson, now South African Director of
Agriculture. Pearson was a mild person of
serious mien, and hung on to Taverner’s coat tails
like a suspecting chaperone. They were staying at
ti i 6 Australia, and there was a very happy pub.
with private bars just a little way off. Taverner
felt one evening that he had endured just enough
of Ins expert’s doleful company. “Tell you what,
Pearson,” he remarked ; “you ought to drop in
at that pub. down the road for an hour or two.
it s the place all the squatters go to. You might
be able to get a yarn with one or two of them and
pick up a few hints.” In half-an-hour Pearson
returned vvitli a face even longer than usual.
I m afraid you’re mistaken about that place,”
he said. “ When I asked whether there were any
squatters about, a barmaid came round and
wanted to sit on my knee.”
A Melbourne pressman on/ Peacock’s
successor:—
Donald Mackinnon, the new leader of the Victorian
Opposition, is a young, prematurely grey' barrister.
He is very wealthy, his family having made a pile of
money out of Western District land, and he has never
senousl.v followed his profession. Most of his time is
occupied in trustee work connected with his family
estates. Immediately af.er his admission to the bar he
became associated with George Higinbothain, and
assisted him in the 1890 consolidation of the Victorian
statutes. During that association Mackinnon became
democratised. That is, Higinbothain did politically with
Mackinnon what a strong magnet will do for a steel nib.
The nib will remain a nib, but will retain certain of the
qualities of the magnet for some time afterwards.
Mackinnon remains an aristocrat, but some of Higin-
botham’s democracy hangs about him still. By and
by the influence will wear off, and Mackinnon will know
himself for what he is. It is not true, as frequently'
stated, that he is related to the Maekinnons of the
Argcs. He was elected to the Assembly in 1900 for
Prahran, and his track on the political chart lacks that
straightness and boldness necessary in a leader
of men. On those parts of the chart covering
women’s suffrage, the reform movement and the
railway strike the track is very faint and curly.
He went into Parliament as an opponent of
women’s suffrage, and last session introduced a Bill to
enfranchise women. When Irvine dissolved Parliament
on the alleged Reform question, Mackinnon was almost
persuaded to sign the Reform League ticket. During the
debate on the outrageous Strike Suppression Bill he
missed a grand opportunity. Instead of taking up the
position that Irvine and Bent had broken the law, and
that the strikers were fighting to keep the patches of
the tattered document together, which he, as a lawyer,,
knew to be the correct one, he shuffled. He condemned
the Ministry and the strikers in the same breath. If he
an . David Syme can come to terms over the question of
religious instruction in State Schools—David’s paper is.
against and Mackinnon for—it is likely that he will get
the support of the Age at next election.
DYING HARD.
Melbourne Cemetery trustees are advertising
that as they have to close on 30th March “now

Lord Loftus, recently dead at the adequate
age of 87, would have had on the whole a happier
career if he had never been Governor of N.S W
Coming, after a distinguished career in the
Foreign Service—straight from St. Petersburg in
fact-the free-and-eas? atmosphere of Australia
was not suitable to his tastes And Loftus was-
poor, and not able to be poor with dignity. His
life at Government House was a series of struggles
to keep out of the petty debts courts, and he-
was not always successful in chasing the bailiff
from the door. Withal he was an able and a
kindly man. He stood up bravely against the
hanging tradition of N.S.W. and saved more than
one life from the scaffold in those days whin, in
the ferocious social and political code of the State
it was thought to be making the best pisil.Te use
of a o , im ; T ,al to hang him.

“D.H.R.” : The copious rains have pro-
duced something besides grass. All over the
mountain districts there are great fields of
thistles measuring miles in extent, and growing
to heights of 8 and 10ft. Many landholders en-
deavor to get rid of these by burning, but they
are the least inflammable of growing things.
One farmer, while making strenuous efforts to
burn thistles, lit a neighboring squatter’s paddock
and destroyed 50 square miles of grass-covered
country, and 7000 sheep.

“Nod” contributes his wheat legend :
I think “ Bob R ” is right re agriculture 25 years ago
(Bulletin, 3/3/04). Take, for instance, the country from
Geelong to Terang (Victoria). I never saw less than 40
bushels, and up to 80, at any time between 1864 and 1874,
all put in with single-furrow plough. Go now to Mode-
warre, Winchelsea, Ondit, Mount Gellebrand, Birregurra,
Oolac, Oamperdown, or Garroo, and you won’t see one
8-bushel crop.
The Bulletin doesn’t profess to know what ex-
traordinary crops there might be in 1864-74 be-
tween Geelong and Terang. But the average
wheat crop of Victoria in 1864 was less than 10
bushels to the acre; in 1874 it was under five
bushels to the acre; and the average for
eleven years was something like 15 bushels.
And that was before the Mallee began to
be included in the wheat area, and by its
habit of yielding one peck to the square league
pulled down the averages. The Bulletin fancies
somehow that the old-time wheat crop is some-
thing like the giants in Genesis—enlarged by
distance.
* * * *
“ Marque Reel ” : “ W.W.” (B. 21/l/ ; 04),
re growth of trees, talks rubbish. He contends
that surveyors’ marks, &c., cut into trees remain
stationary because the wood at that point is dead.
But if the barrel grew upwards it would carry the
small patcli of dry wood with it, otherwise it
would have to grow past it, as a stream of water
would flow past a stake driven in its course.
There is nothing to hold the few ounces of dry
wood down ; the tree beneath it is alive, and,
according to “ W.W.,” is growing all the time. I
have seen saplings bored and wires run through
them for fence ; though saplings have doubled in
height, wires have not risen. The main branches
of trees are not formed when the tree is young.
The tallest gum started life as a bushy plant ; but
as new branches are added on top the under ones
wither away and drop off. All upward growth is
of new wood. I have also pruned fruit trees when
a year old, and 20 years after the early forks had
not risen, although the trees had grown to a great
size. Saplings forking at the ground grow to trees
in that form, forming what is known to bushmen
as sister-trees—be., trees joined together at the
butt.

SOME CONSOLATION IN SHEOL.
MR. TAPLEY (a Sydney citizen who has reached there in a Sydney muggy
month): “ There's one thing I Like about your climate — it’s a dry heat.”
“ Bob R.” writes :
After branding me as a fine old Conservative, you might
have spared me those wheat statistics! I confess
you have caught me on the hop re 40-bushel crops—as
“averages.” In the late ’7o’s and ’Bo’s 1 have seen
4 ) bushel crops, and agriculturists of that date will
bear me out —isolated cases, I admit, but nevertheless
facts. What I wished to point out is that, with all our
advanced ideas on agriculture and up-to-date machinery,
there is no material average advance in wheat production
on the period of rude implements, and that the farmers
of the latter period were far more prosperous than those
of the present day. And the reason is not far to seek.
The single-furrow plough was a cheap and lasting imple-
ment, and did its work better than the up-tj-date,
expensive American “gimcracks” now used—it was
slower, no doubt, but the early agriculturist did
not aim at rushing in an enormous quantity
of crop—he put in a small area well! In getting off his
crop he used a mower and thresher, saved all his grain
and straw; the smart, present-day cocky, with his large
areas ripening at once, rushes over it with a stripper or
“ harvester,” leaving a considerable quantity “ shedded
out” by the wind in the paddock—sometimes he leaves
the most of it! My argument is that “ intensive ” farm-
ing with cheap and lasting implements gives a better
return and pays better than “extensive” farming
with the expensive and deli maci i es now in
use. That’s my opinion only, and if any modem
millionaire cocky wishes to call me an infernal liar
he will suffer no bodily harm at iny hands.
The Bulletin’s theory is somewhat dif-
ferent from the above, and it doesn’t reckon
that the single-furrow plough was the cause
of the farmer’s old-time prosperity. Nor
does it reckon that he went in for intense
culture in the old days ; it rather fancies
he was a great deal less intense then than
he is now. But in the ’7o’s and ’Bo’s he
averaged ss. or ss. 6d. for his wheat where
he now gets 2s. 6d. Further, practically the
whole of the wheat-growing was then in the
comparatively well-watered country; the great
mass of dead-broke farmers that are now
struggling in the dry regions hadn’t come
into existence then, and so the unpros-
perous agriculturist didn’t loom up in the
papers as he does now. On the fertile
North Coast, for instance, the yield per
acre was greater in 1901 than in 1887, and
on the Hunter it was better in 1897-1901
than in 1881-1887, though in the latter years
the land was much less exhausted by culti-
vation. But the prices were different —
very different indeed, and even if the
farmer went back to the scratchy, in-
efficient methods of his forefathers, he isn’t
likely to get those old prices back again.
“W.S.T.”: Be “ Bullaman’s ” statement
(B. 4/2/’O4) about apparent transformation of a
gum-tree into an iron-bark. Divested of some
exaggeration, the phenomenon may be attributed
to some hybridisation, an occurrence referred to
by Mr. Maiden, our Government Botanist. The
subject is worth study, as hybrid eucalypts have
apparently become permanent types, as happens
in the animal kingdom. It is not improbable that
the “messmate” (E. obliqua) is an altered
stringy-bark, the vernacular name having been
conferred, it is asserted, by a keen-eyed black-
fellow, who dubbed it “messmate, brother be-
longing to stringy-bark.” LB° W the deuce did a
blackfellow get to know of such an out-of-the-way
word as “messmate”?— Ed. B.] Bushmen have
long observed such freaks in trees, which they
style “bastard box,” “bastard mahogany,” and
so on, a custom referred to by the late Baron von
Mueller in one of his works on eucalypts.
* * * *
“R.”: Be “ W.P.C.” (B. 18/2/’O4), on the
bitter aloe. Aloes are very plentiful here. One
species flowers regularly every ten years, another
has been known to bloom well every three years.
Still another, watched with great interest by an
old resident, bloomed last year for the first time
for 20 years ; it is flowering again this year, per-
haps due to phenomenal season. By the way,
crows congregate round the bitter aloe tree when
it is in flower, and they pull the flowers off one by
one and make as much noise as if they had struck
a dead lamb.
“Bunny”: “Jim Pan’s” string of 40
camels is a small affair for Broken Hill. A tra'n
of 82 camels has just arrived from Menindie
carrying 13i tons of general merchandise and soft-
goods for a Broken Hill firm. Goods came by
boat from Adelaide to the Red Sandhill (I mean
miserable Menindie), and are camel-carried thence
to Silver City. Takes camels days to do the
Menindie-Broken Hill journey (about GO miles).
Seven men manage the menagerie. The leading
camels are caparisoned (what a royally rich sound
that word has !) in gorgeous style witli plush, gilt
braid, rich hangings, shell embroideries, tinkling
bells, &c. This large train was not commanded
by Abdul Soojee Bhag, but by Goolab Turban.
* * * *
“C.C." writes: “A.L.M.H.” (B. 17/3/’O4)
inquires the why and wherefore of the expression,
“Miserable as a bandicoot.” Its meaning is
obvious enough if “ orphan ” is put before the
animal’s name and “on a burnt ridge” is added
on after it, but the Australian generally leaves
half his sentences unfinished, or clips them both
fore and aft. Can’t expect him to remark, “Those
clouds betoken that we shall shortly be blessed
with a refreshing shower of rain,’ when “Looks
like rain ” conveys the same amount of informa-
tion ; or “ I wish you a good day, mate,” when
“ ’Day, mate” suffices. By the way, “Miserable
as an orphan bandicoot on a burnt ridge ” was a
favorite expression of Henry Parkes, but don’t
know if he originated it. Don’t know, either, if
his request to “Go outside, and bark with the
other dogs,” made to the noisy portion of his
audiences, was original. Some of the similes of
the bush are very expressive, and deserve to be
recorded. The one, “He looked like a clothes-
peg on a wire clothes-line,” to describe a skinny
man riding a skeleton horse, is graphic.
* * * *
“ War E.” : In his list of the accomplish-
ments of Southern-line “travellers,” “C.C.”
(8., 3/3/’O4) misses a couple. The ex-Fellow,
or ex-something else, of Oxford or Cam-
bridge, who reads to you a lengthy manu-
script on “ The Affinity of the Soul.” He
knows The Bcllyteen would pay him well
for it, but he hasn’t the stamps. Give
him a “bob,” and he goes to the nearest
pub. for them. Another is the political
traveller, and he’s fairly frequent too.
His “speeches” from the pub. verandah
are often more interesting, and certainly
more earnest, than those of the average
M.P. I never grudge him a beer-he
earns it. Both types are generally old and
bleary-eyed, and try to impress you that
they are something better than they look.
The journalist traveller is a species new
to this beat; but country editors reach now
for the paste-pot when one of them puts
his touzled head into the sanctum.
“Mym” sends two questions and a ML
fact:
Can any bush Cinquevalli take two freshwater mussels
and break the shells of both, at the same time, by knock-
ing them together? Have never seen the feat done yet.
What kind of spider, insect or caterpillar is it that
makes the handsome silky purses found hanging to grass-
stems by Vic. rivers—especially the Ovens?
Beechworth (Vic.) boasts a gold-dreamer, whose dreams
have been verified on several occasions—Skidmore by
name, a miner. On the last occasion, the dreamer “ had
a dream” to the effect that under a certain stone in
Dirty' Creek, adjacent to his home, there was a quantity
of gold. He told his parents of his dream, diverted the
trickling flow, and earned £lB before breakfast. These
dreams are now looked upon as ordinary happenings of
the Skidmore family.
“ Caro ” about an evil thing :
Last full moon, with little more than a capful of wind,
we were sailing, drifting lazily, from point to point, when
somewhere off Forty Baskets we noticed a dark shadow
shepherding the boat. Going about, we surprised the
substance in the shape of a large shark, who evidently
had us on his mind. Taoked over to the Heads, and
about half-way across we found him still following. A
bag lowered from the stern brought him up with a
stealthy rush to within 20ft., but no closer. He followed
silently in our wake all the time we were out, and only
when we made for our landing-place in the light of a
busy wharf did he disappear in the general dimness. Out
of curiosity we took the same route the next night, and
suddenly in the moonlight we saw the black fin emeige
and give chase. It was impossible to shake him off.
Missiles had no effect, and though we slewed almost on
him once, he sheered off placidly under our bows. The
next night was not so clear, but our black tracker made
his appearance as before—this time closer to the boat.
One of the crew hung over the stern watching his move-
ments, and barely a quarter of an hour afterwards elec-
trified us by a most deplorable exhibition of hysterical
fright. It was terrible to see-he whimpered from ihe
bottom of the boat that he was being mesmerised over-
board. We made for home. Things had gone far enough,
so on the next trip preparations were made for the shark's
destruction, if possible. But, though the shadow dul\
appeared, he kept his distance and scorned the entie ng
biit. The party returned unsuccessful with neither
nerve-shakeu boy. I wonder if any other boat has been
treated to this gruesome surveillance ! From our obser-
vation, sharks must possess the same powers of hypnotism
as snakes.

“ Wer.” : A writer, who had spent much
of a long life among horses, says in Harper's
Magazine :
I believe the horse to he part maniac and part idiot.
Every horse at some time of his life develops into a homi-
cidal maniac. I believe any man who trusts himself or
his family to the power of a horse stronger than himself
to be lacking in common sense, and wholly devoid of
ordinary prudence. I have driven one commonplace
horse every day for six years over the same road, and
then had him go crazy and try to kill himself anil me
because a leaf fluttered down in front of him. I have
known scores of horses, apparently creatures of routine,
go wild and insane over equally regu'ar and recurring
phenomena. No amount of observation can tel', when
the brute will break out. One mare took two generations
of children to school over the same quiet road, and ih m
in her nineteenth year went crazy because a rooster
crowed alongside the road. She killed two of tbe
children. If any man can tell me of one good reason why
man should trust a horse, I should he glad to know.
Most bushmen have faith in the ordinary hack,
but are unanimous in classing the stallion among
the animals that can never be trusted. But even
the quietest old moke is to he treated with respect.
The Bulletin, I think, a few years ago, cited the
case of the miner’s boy, who had been in the habit
of hanging on to his horse’s tail while climbing out
of the cutting. He had done it hundreds of times,
hut one day the old horse lashed out and killed
him. The horse is a gun that is always loaded.

“Cecil P.” : Be the sweating of children
in N.S.W. dairy districts. I have known
of (literally) thousands of such cases. The
kiddies are up at the first peep of dawn;
bring in cows ; help in milking ; bolt a breakfast
and trudge to school. Home in the afternoon ;
after cows again ; milk again and do odd chores.
Supper, generally, by lamplight. Then home
lessons (God help us all !). To bed with dazed
brains—and so on, year in, year out. Often the
product of incestuous marriages—between first
cousins of the same bovine breed—is it any wonder
that their constitutions are bad, their physical
blemishes so common as to pass without comment
and that they are stupid to an incredible extent?
The manager of Yudnapinna station, who
has been breeding mules in the Far North of S.
Australia for some years, gives those animals a
much better character than they usually get.
First he says that the comic artist who always
presents a mule in the act of kicking is clean out
it—“there isn't a kick in the crowd of them.’
For obstinacy, though, they deserve all that has

been said of them. Cross them anyhow, and they
will sulk, and then you might as well give in at
once. The Yudnapinna experience is that toi
rough, backblock work, in a country of drought
and desolation, they beat everything else that
lives. One curious fact in connection with them
is that the mares are unspeakably cruel to the
foals, and often attack them with such savage
ferocity that they kill them.
ODE TO WYONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh ! dreary Wyong, up whose crooked street
Perambulates a goat, with dismal bleat,
The only sound of life, save now and then,
A cackle comes from some old laying hen.
’Tis true I saw a bullock-team to-day,
A man, and dog—but these have gone away ;
And now I gaze both up the street and down,
One sign of life—that goat—in Wyong town.

The account is given in S. Australia of a
mare which, in order to get back to her old home,
swam Lake Alexandrina some years ago. In a
straight line the distance is between 15 and 16
miles. The animal was old at the time —certainly
over nine years—and was so exhausted by the
journey that she could not rise for two days after
she stumbled ashore. Mr. Hacket, manager of
Narrung Station, gives the particulars. The mare
was bred on Glencoe Station.

“D.H.R.”; Up New England (N.S.W.)
way things are in a bad plight. It is reported
that there are over 200 unemployed (part of the
Government batch landed at harvest time) camped
in and around Inverell. The stations are practic-
ally besieged with requests for tucker. In conse-
quence of this, several stations have displayed
notices on their roadside gates to this effect :
“No hands wanted ; no rations given ; trespassers
prosecuted.” Some of them have simply, “No
admittance.” One has “Beware of the white
dog.” That notice is very successful; though the
real white dog is a poodle about nine inches high.
In a recent bike tour through Warialda, Inverell,
&c., met about 300 unemployed in various stages
of starvation.

“ Hiphen ” : “ Prooshan’s ” sensational
story about holding the breath while grasping a
bull-dog or ant or other wild animal to prevent it
biting one, reminds me of an adventure I once had
with wild bees. Together with a country friend
I intruded on a wild-beehive. The animals were
wild—very; also, they were not at home to
visitors, and turned out to tell us so. I took
the hint and a hurried departure, breaking
several records and my braces in reaching an
adjacent waterhole, where I became a submerged
tenth. After a few moments (during which I
certainly did hold my breath), I combed the
slime and water-lilies from my eyes and looked
round for my friend. To my horror he was lying
face downwards on the ground—motionless,
wlnle a swarm of angry insects hummed and ha-ad
and used bad language about him. Presently
they drew off, and I went to his assistance,
expecting a coroner’s inquest. To my surprise
he got up unscathed—with not as many bites as
are to be obtained at a sea-side boarding-house.
After he had ceased laughing in a silly and
uncalled-for manner at my condition, he
explained that as, after a bee has stung, it
retires from business and hands in its checks,
it is naturally careful that when it does sting
'k 101 , ne on a deserving object. Therefore,
by shamming dead or remaining perfectly still,
THE LATE MRS. JOHN SEE, wife of the
Premier of N.S. W.
the bee is persuaded that you cannot be the dis-

■ , Bullseye ; Instead of messing about
with expensive incubators, which give a big per-
centage of loss, our poultry-farmers, in summer at
least, should follow the example of two Australian
turds—the brush-turkey (talegalla) and the mallee-
foen—which place their eggs in a mound of leaves,
and leave the kindly warmth of vegetable decom-
position to do the rest. Present writer knows of
«.t least one resident on the Macquarie (up Warren
wa.y) who, every year, hatches a number of
■chickens in his kitchen-midden in the open air.
He just places the eggs under an inch or so of
ashes, and m due process the chickens arrive.
“D.K.”: Away back
in Victoria, where I am at
present, there are 36 in-
habitants, out of whom
no fewer than eight are
“ratty.” One man is
rarely seen except at
full moon, and then he
goesquietlyabout look-
ing for the apostle
Paul, up trees, etc.
Says so far he hasn’t
come across him (from
what I know of the
place he’s not likely
to), but he very often
sees Moses sitting on
a post. Another, a
woman, keeps watch
at night in case
Irvine, Bent, or other
notorious characters
take it into their
heads to come down
her chimney. She
has defences of
barbed wire cunning-
ly arranged in case of
emergency. On her
sane nights she helps
herself to her neigh-
bor’s wood, veget-
ables, etc. Another
man thinks he is a
detective, and is for
ever investigating
cases, as he calls it.
He keeps saying that
the other seven luna-
tics are “as silfejiis
rabbits,”and that fpjy
ought to be locked)flip
for their own safety.
Whenever they aremen-
ioned he taps his fore-
head significantly and
winks. The remaining
cranks have their own
little ways of livening up moonlight nights. The
sane 26 (myself included, so far), have to do their
walking on dark evenings, or else be gibbered at
by the person who finds Moses sitting on a post or
pursued by the detective. A T o one, so far, has
made any complaint. There is no policeman, no
telephone, no anything. Just 20 miles away from
civilisation, in an open-air lunatic asylum.
“ E.S.S.” : J. W. R. Clarke,
writing in the S. M. Herald (9/3/’04) on
the destruction of protected birds, ex-
plains that the ibis is the bird commonly
known as : ‘ the happy family ” or the
“twelve apostles.” No greater rot was
ever printed. The ibis is a large wading
bird, the others are small perehers, or
forest birds. The straw necked ibis
(Geronticus spinicollis, Jameson), com-
monly known as the black-and-white
ibis, is bigger than a Mallee hen. It goes
in large flocks, and usually fly in V-for-
mation. The white ibis ( Threskiornis
strictipennis, Gould) is about the size of
an ordinary crane. This bird is rarer
than the other, and is more often seen in
pairs than in flocks. Both have naked
heads (black-skinned) like the leather-
head, and have curved beaks, about 6in.
long. The glossy ibis ( Plegadis falci-
nel/us, Linn.), which is much smaller,
is feathered on the head. The twelve
apostles ( Struthidea cinerea, Gould) are
about the size of the spotted bower birds,
lea len-grey in color, with black wing-
feathers and tail. They build small
round mud nests on top of a limb. All
travellers are familiar with these birds.
They will dance around your feet, and
pick up crumbs within reach of your
hand. The ibis will rarely let anybody
approach nearer than 50 yards. The
happy family, or grey-crowned Poma-
tastomus ( Pornatastomus temporalis) is a
trifle smaller than the “twelveapostles.”
The general coloring is light slate;
breast, tawny; throat, white, with a
good deal of smudgy white about the
head ; and the black tail is tipped with a
band of snow whit . It builds a fairly
large nest of sticks and leaves, wedged
among small upright branches.

“F.J.W.”: Among the many
things the white cockatoo likes to chew is
indiarubber. Rode out, the other day, to do a bit of
duck shooting. Left my bike under a tree while I
went in search of game. On coming back, cocky
had mangled the Jjack tyre, and, judging by the
feathers and absence of bird, he must have
received a severe shock when he got through the
inner tube, and the bike “ blew out ” right in his
cheerful countenance.

Mr. Fred Turner’s valuable paper (read to
the Linnean Society originally) on the botanv of
the Darling district (N.S.W.j has been printed as
a pamphlet. It catalogues all the known plants
of that dry region, and, in an introductory note,
describes some of the most notable varieties. The
first work on the subject, its completeness seems
to promise that, for some while, it will be the last.
WISE FORESIGHT.

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will betaken of
communications insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must ap ear on 1/?. Xo liability is under-
taken in any case re contributions voluntarily sub-
mitted, whether sent by >ost or hanited in ; and in
no case will Mi. be returned unless stamps (of any
State) accompany.
J.L.S. (Healesville) : Will print your letter.
But (1) with regard to building societies, there is hardly
one in Australia that is making bread and cheese, and
most of them have gone broke through lending to people
like you more than the property was worth. (2) There
are more dead banks than live ones in Australia, and of
the live ones only about one-half are doing much good.
That kind of brigandage hasn’t paid very well on the
whole. (3) As to life assurance societies, if you pay up
your premiums and another man doesn’t pay his, would
you like your money to go to pay his policy when he
dies? Also, have you ever considered the Victorian
farmer (especially the dairy-farmer) in his capacity as a
brigand ? Nardo : Not well enough put; and you don’t
give any authority for your statements about Russia
Kigig: You can’t write English yet Zoma: Verse
feeble. Other piece moderately funny G.T.W. : In-
different workmanship Onlooker : Manner pretty
good ; matter not interesting enough H.H. : Not
strongly enough treated for such a well-worn motive.
. ...Ajam: Mere inanity. You apparently lack every
literary qualification Orion: Sorry unsuitable... ;
Mathala : When your uninteresting description of a Dutch
dance in the Transvaal costs us sd. for deficient postage,
it rises to the dignity of an insult Herr Bloak : Poem
to Gwendoline has gone to the devil E.G.H. : Very
large and loose, and wild and whizzing ; also very hard to
understand A. Essilmont: Not enough in it... .Beau-
mont S. : Would hardly suit us... .H. Burgoyne : No
merit in either Icicie : You haven’t the necessary
lightness of touch The Chiel (Q.) : Fairly smart, but
belated Carnation: Not up to standard Argo :
Ver3' flat and tame Jasper : No ; we don’t advise you
to persevere Renzy (or something like that): A truly
wonderful poem. So here goes:—
Other contribution firmly declined Ex-Victorian : You
don’t read the paper closely ; renegade Murray has been
often condemned.... Quinces: You forget that various
?thn S u U f'L ber , their Ten Commandments differently
(though they disregard them unanimously), so vour
Seventh Commandment joke would miss fire Weno :
Very crude and feeble— Albacutya : Neither quite up tc
the mark. ‘ 207” : Moderately funny, but too trifling
.. ..a.p.ls.: A long way below publication 1eve1....
Aerxes: A dreary wilderness of words Pere Jacques'
JNo;we don’t intend to print it... .Hoppy: We always
return rejected manuscripts when stamps and address
are sent Ruby King: It’s an opulent name, but the
poetry is poor—in fact, quite destitute A Quaint
Kiter : Too quaint by a long way... .Medico : Bells are a
cracked verse subject....A.Y.S. : On the whole, Tiib
Bulletin would advise the State servants of Victoria to
ect the ablest men, irrespective of most else,
they want men who will be thorns in the side of the
ry party, and make it regret the separate representa-
lnicluity" • -. p ip ; The reason George Reid doesn’t
appear so much in the caitoons is that G.R. is a dwin-
dling dog nowadays, and his importance doesn’t merit
as many pictures as before M.P. : (1) Your verses
don t deserve to be printed; (2) you don’t deserve to be
well slated in the Corres. Column.” J.W.D. : Poetry
aoesn t run in your family, that’s evident. Your pa’s
poetry is indifferent; yours is worse... .Scallywag : We
na\e decided that question so as to avoid further con-
troversv. Every bush teacher thinks the city teacher is
, !’. er , than he is ; every city teacher thinks the same
ot the hush teacher... .E.D.: “Only” doesn’t get near
tne mark Hiphen (and many others): Please note
that the Bible doesn’t say that Elijah went up in a fiery
cnanot. The Bulletin has allowed one of its artists to
perpetuate the old fallacy because his picture touched
the soul of the religious editor, but the matter must go
no further....E.D.S. : Thanks; will be glad to get
report, but present writer heard that preacher, and was
not much impressed. Religion is largely a matter of
temperament; some people are susceptible to it, others
not. But when religion of any brand makes a man feel
better and act better he can reckon he’s about on the
right track....C.R.B. : Well versed, but sentiment too
trite.... Unsuitable : H.G.R., Brisbane, H.T.R., Wonye,
Eileen M... .Otipoki : You dodge very actively away
from your lie about N.S.W. having had Freetrade Minis-
ters m the past, but it remains the same old lie. If you
really are serious about the paper question it may
interest you to know that in the matter of that industry
even Victoria was foolish enough in the past to foliow
your fiscal policy, and through too much Freetrade the
article required isn’t procurable. Bulletin has tried
repeatedly to negotiate for Australian supplies, and hopes
when your fiscal superstition is sufficiently dead, to get
them... .Outcast : Too difficult to fix up for print....
Th.M. : “Love’s ABO” a purely artificial yarn Sp.:
Magazine Yarn” too gruesome D.M.P. :So many
people write about their longing for the bush and the
hills and the creek that the thing needs to be extra well
done to pass C.C.B. :It simply means that that was
the average rate received for all the produce sent over
the N.S.W. lines during the year. An immense quantity
was doubtless carried free, which reduced the average....
F.E.P.W. : Verse no good. Prose—scrawled on both
sides of paper—under consideration Barbara S. : The
compliment is Al, but the verse, alas! is Z 3....
Mervyn : Will be glad to hear from you again. “ Un-
fortunate occurrence ” will make no difference.... A.G. :
Such rhymes as “ benificence-improvidence,” “miracle-
cynical,” “ freely-chimpanzee” are awful. Then you
make six rhymes in succession : “for you,” “in you,”
“of you,” “for you,” “to you,” “to hell with you.”
These are worse than awful... .Darkey : Nothing in it
Nawrik : Not a bad yarn, but diluted into insipidity
with too much verbiage.
IN PUSH SOCIETY.
PROUD WIFE : “ Can ’e fight? Can’t ’e just?
Look at my face. He done that in ’arf a
round."
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
Schmidt: One returned. The other may do as a sug-
gestion Bagman : Drawing rough and joke geological.
G.W.A. : No point about joke, unless it is mistaken
for something indecent M‘G. :No good. Destroyed
as requested.. .. Widdy : Not a very fresh joke... .James
D. : Lindsay’s name appeared on the drawing because
it was his drawing. The suggestion was yours, but the
sketch which accompanied it was wholly unsuited for re-
production... .G.M.F. : It may be very ingenious and
extraordinary and remarkable, but we don’t seem to have
much use for “ blotography.”
THE ELM TREE.
I sat under The Elm Tree,
And gazed across the bay,
Watching the dear old ship,
Sailing over the cruel, cruel, waves,
For on her was my greatest friend,
W T ho was sailing far away.
The ship was now obscured,
From view,
But still I gazed,
Fancying, that I could see her,
Kneeling by The Cabin Boor,
Praying for God’s guidance,
For all on board,
I turned away from The Elm Tree,
Which a heart more heavier than before.
The night was drawing nigh,
The wind began to blow,
I thought of my dear friend,
Far out on the waves,
The wind blew stronger and stronger,
Vnd the signal gun was heard,
For the ship went down,
With crew at hand,
But mv dear old friend,
Was saved.

Westralia will have a general election for both
Houses in May. Premier James’ idea was to
split the country into Ministerialists and Labor-
ites; but Pigott’s small band of Tories, who
mostly represent square miles and bullocks, will
not have any of that. Their idea is that the local
results of the Federal elections have put “the
dread of Labor domination” into the great heart
of Groperdom, and that the Tory ranks will swell
until nothing less than the Government benches
will hold them. The little bit of reform which
the Hackett House let through last session won’t,
however, help them. Bullocks, ticks, and square
miles are still represented ; but the Assembly has
lost its plural vote, and the bullock-and-tick
member isn’t as strong as he was. The Hackett
House, on the other hand, stands just about where
it did—it will still represent only about one-sixth
of the Assembly electors (21,000 out of 120,000);
so even the Groper who “dreads Labor domina-
tion ” need not be much alarmed. Even though
Pigott should come back with only two fol-
lowers the House of Hackett will still be on
guard.

Concerning the suggestion that “godlessness”
has much to do with keeping the cradle empty,
and that if the churches were more active the
cradle would be rocked oftener, consider the posi-
tion in S. Australia. In proportion to population,
no State has so many of either church buildings or
clergy ; while the various Methodists, who have
some thousands of unpaid “local preachers,”
number more than a fourth of the whole popula-
tion nearly twice the proportion in any other
State. Probably this great frequency of preacher,
and the constant holding up of a scorching here-
after to the sinner has had something to do with the
rarity of the State’s illicit infant; anyway, on the
basis of either total births or per 1000 of the popu-
lation, S. Australia’s illegitimacy rate has been for
many years the lowest in Australasia and almost,
if not quite, the lowest in all that part of the
world which collects figures abcut such things.
On the other hand, if the preacher has been able
to scare the illegitimate infant off the premises,
he has been a gloomy failure in enticing the other
sort; in fact, S. Australia, with most preacher and
most church, has stood for years past pretty
regularly at the very bottom of the Australian
birth-rate list. Only Victoria was lower for some
> T ®£F S . a ?,d even Victoria hasn’t been so low since
1‘JOO. Further, somehow the S. Australian
experience knocks up against the idea that the
baby still arrives with all its old regularity in an
agricultural community, because there the
youngster can soon earn his crust driving up
the cows. Possibly, though, S. Australia has so
tew cows left that it recognises that the existing
number is quite adequate for the job, wherefore
the agricultural argument doesn’t apply. The
great birth-rate remedy is obviously to get more
cows.

0. De Thierry, in the United Service Maga-
zine :—
We argue that the colonies owe us gratitude because
we bear the responsibility of their protection. But do
we ? No such responsibility has ever been assumed by
England since first she entered the colonial field. On the
contrary, defence in the British empire is based on the
principle of self-help ; which, like self-government,
marks out the colonies of England from the colonies of
other powers. As for the navy, its duties in war time
will embrace the protection of British commerce in
general, and of food-stuffs and raw tna erial in particul r.
Naturally, then, there will lie no distinction as to the
country if origin, and the colonies and their keenest
rivals can command the active interest of England on
equal terms. It is not so long ago since the use of
the British navy was given to the United States
in the Spanish-Amerioan war. Yet for want of
similar action, Canada has had to sacrifice rights
and territory as though she belonged to the weakest,
instead of to the strongest, Empire in the world. In the
same way a great war will find our fleets protecting the
commerce of Argentina as freeiy as they protect the com-
merce of the Dominion or Australasia. Nevertheless,
contributions are expected only from colonials, and
because they are in no hurry io pay, we place the
responsibility on them, rather than on our own insular
cosmopolitanism We cannot eat our cake and have it.
We demand of them money aid to the navy, which we
forget will protect the commerce of their rivals in war-
fare. This is too much to ask of them or any people,
particularly when they have no voice in he councils of
the Empire. Until we make some distinction between
our children and others in the home market, it is useless
to expect any material help towards defence in peace
time, because the means to pay it is drained to foreign
countries by our system of free imports.
A Woman’s Power.
The smiles and favor of a beautiful woman are
Heaven enough for most men. But beauty and
grace in woman are founded on good health. Good
health depends on good digestion, and that in-
variably follows the use of Mother Seigel’s Syrup,
a tonic made of fruits, roots and herbs. Beauty
and strength spring up beside it, as flowers on a
sunny slope. It brightens the eyes, clears the skin,
and gives vigor, vivacity, and health to the
languid and weak. All women need it occasionally ;
tens of thousands use it daily. “I was greatly
troubled,” wrote Mrs. Brankier, of 48, Pacific-
street, Newcastle, N.S.W., on February 28th,
1903, “by chronic indigestion. Several doctors,
whom I consulted at different times, quite failed
to do me any good. But about twelve months ago
I heard of a wonderful cure of indigestion in this
city, effected by Mother Seigel’s Syrup and
resolved to try it myself. After taking the Syrup
for a few days I felt like a different woman, less
than four bottles being sufficient to effect my
complete cure, eradicating all traces of indigestion
from my system. I cm strmglv recommend
Seigel’s Syrup to all persons afflicted with indiges-
tion and stomach derangement, being convinced
by my own experience that they will find it a
speedy and reliable cure.’ *
During 1902 of the 29 patients who died
in the Melbourne gaol hospitals 21 were uncon-
victed, and against some of them no conviction
had ever bean recorded ! Under Victorian condi-
tions nowadays the gaols are getting to be reserved
principally for the poor and honest.

That exceedingly optimistic individual
Treasurer Gardiner, of Westralia, has been blow-
ing a trumpet about the size of a railway tunnel
to the general effect that no State is so well-fitted
to pull through when Bull cuts off the supply of
loans as his patch of sand and Groperdom.
1 here is probably a rough awakening preparing
for the vociferous Gardiner. Westralia, in pn>
portion to population, has borrowed and lived on
loans during the last ten years to an extent that
no other country on earth ever dreamed of. Even
now it is borrowing more than twice as heavily
in proportion to its population, as N.S. W. did in
its worst days, and the hird-up Eastern States
have themselves been lending to Gardiner’s State
to keep its head above water. For this prize
mendicant to begin putting on airs is a humorous
proceeding.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The eight-hours system in the Victorian
railway service is being gradually uprooted by
the Irvine-Bent crowd. Porters and station-
masters in the country districts are working 9, 10,
and even 12 hours a day, and the engine-men
average about 9J hours a day.
N.S.W. scraped up another very tem-
porary £250,000 loan last week, and Treasurer
Waddell, being asked to what use the money
would be applied, stated beamingly, “to loan
purposes exclusively.” Valuable information !
N.S.W. is full of loan purposes.
There is still a smell about Vic. Lands
Department, though pious M‘Kenzie has de-
parted Latest hint of scandal is given by a
selector, W. A. Crabtree, who claims that the
Department is trying to hustle him out of half his
land to give it to a member of Parliament.
The last Queensland labor vessel, the
Clansman, arrived in Bundaberg a few days ago.
It was licensed to recruit 36 “boys, but only
secured 19. There are practically no “boys
returning to the islands voluntarily now.. Lx-
pirees ” can earn nearly the wages of a white man.
Arthur Reid, of Kalgoorlie Sun, is a can-
didate for a seat in the Westralian Upper House
on refreshingly novel and democratic lines. His
programme is, briefly, absentee-tax, income-tax,
graduated land-tax, and abolition of the Upper
House. In other words, Arthur Reid wants to
be made 1M.L.0. so that he may vote foi the
abolition of himself and the rest of the effete
institution. The Bulletin thinks a great deal
more of his pluck than of his chances.
Someone ought to muzzle the Jingo asses
of -Vustralia, if only to prevent them basiling their
own god by telling the truth about it. A member
of the tribe (name of Stoddart) bleating the other
day (asses don’t bleat as a rule, but it’s near
enough), under the auspices of the Sydney branch
of the Empire League (E. C. V. Broughton’s
league) said : “It is not patriotism, but hunger,
that fills the ranks of the British army.” In
other words, the “ Bovs of the Bulldog Breed
have to choose between the workhouse, the gaol,
and the army. Surely the wickedest pro-Boer
never said anything quite so treasonable as that.
THE GHINO-BRITISH RACE OF THE FUTURE ,
DESTINED TO DEFY THE WORLD.
“When the Chinese became Chrisuanisid and intermarried
(!) with Britishers the tear of war throughout the world would
be groundless (sic) as together they wou.d be able to defy the
other nations. God made the Emperor of China as much as lie
mad' him (the Mayor), and he asked them to drink his (the
Emperor’s) health.”— The Mayor of Ballarat at the dinner of
the Chinese Bo Leona Society.
WHITE AUSTRALIAN : “ Well, God nut it have made the
Emperpr of China, and possibly also the Mayor
of Ballarat, but who made this? ”
Senator Higgs, from Queensland, had an
easy victory for the position of Chairman of Com-
mittees. He beat “Bobby” Best by 17 votes to
12. Higgs is the most solemn, woe-begone, dreary-
looking man m the Federal Parliament, but pos-
sesses one of the brightest and most nimble intel-
lects in Australian politics.
N.S.W. Premier John See returns to
Sydney this week, and the fate of the Cabinet
will then be decided. Most of the Ministerial
following rather hope for the retirement of Mr.
See. That would facilitate a reconstruction with
a financial reform programme, which holds out
about the only hope of escaping annihilation at
the polls.
Fortune is not favoring the Tory cause in
Victoria. First Bent, he of the wild roar and
the unspeakable manners, becomes its leader.
Now the Opposition is relieved of the incubus ot
the leadership of Peacock, the vain bird who is,
more than anyone, responsible for its disorganisa-
tion, and Mackinnon, who succeeds Peacock,
is suspected of being a strong man. He can t well
be weaker tham Peacock, anyhow.
Amid all the shoreless seas of drivel which
constituted “the debate on the address-in-reply,”
Labor Representative Thomson, of Queensland,
supplied one little item of common-sense. He
stated (in minutes) that there should be no
address-in-reply, and that the Australian Parlia-
ment should get right on with business. This
was after Pumpkin Smith had pounded the air for
hours and whirled his coat-tails all over the
place.
The labor colony which was started at
Leongatha (Vic.) a few years ago is beginning to
get on the nerves of Premier Tom Bent. He has
called for yet another report on the past, present,
and future of this settlement. Meanwhile, the
Director of Agriculture is “controlling” the land
and the 80 residents thereon, who are maintained
at a cost of Bs. 6d. per head per week, the time of
the 80 men being devoted —so Bent says —to the
management of 80 cows.
N.S.W. Attorney-General has framed new
rules in regard to art-unions. In future no per-
mission is to be granted for an art-union (save for
the purpose of disposing of genuine works of art)
unless three responsible persons enter into a bond
to the amount which the lottery is expected to
raise. Also the promoters must give a guarantee
that all the money, less a sum not exceeding 10
per cent., shall be handed over to the oharities
which it is intended to benefit.
Bent’s Government and the ’Pootra
League are to stump the State together for the
Victorian June elections, a committee of the
Cabinet having arranged to work with a sub-
committee of the League’s executive to that end.
Which is doubtless right and proper from a Tory
point of view—but if a Cabinet committee were to
fight an election hand in hand with a committee
of the Trades Hall Council, what sort of an
uproar about “Trades Hall domination” would
the Fat party raise?
The daily newspapers are all at sea in
their speculations on the Federal political position.
Sydney Telegraph reaches the height of absurdity
when it pictures Ministers George Turner, Drake,
Chapman and Playford following Lyne in a move-
ment to reconstruct the Cabinet with Kingston,
Isaacs and Watson. A few facts are: Watson
will go into no Ministry “ on his own ” ; the Labor
party will not follow Lyne; Kingston will not
follow Lyne (since with any change he will be
called upon to lead, why should he ?); and Turner
will stand by Deakin.
Premier Deakin should muzzle his Post-
master-General, who, speaking at Mudgee
(N.S.W.) on the inclusion of State employees in a
Federal Arbitration scheme, said :
Such an action would be an invasion of State rights.
If it were attempted, the States would be in open
rebellion.
Such silly talk is probably Mr. Fysh’s idea of
“ backing up ” his chief ; but it will be awkward
to explain away when, as is quite possible, the
course of negotiation brings Premier Deakin to
accept a complete Arbitration Bill.
“The Rook” : Be supposed in-
capacity of women to record their votes
sensibly. I was poll clerk in a certain
hamlet at recent election for Senate and
Representatives, and found that the
women knew their business better than
the men ; in fact, the latter were, in
nine cases out of ten, directed by the
returning officer. Latter usually said :
“Now, Reorge, you are called upon to
exercise the franchise in three different
ways to-day. First, there’s the House
of Representatives, then the Senate, and
then the ninety.” He didn’t call it the
Reduction of Members. He then said:
“For the House of Representatives we
have the old tried horse, Mr. Blank
Blank. He has always stuck to the
farmers (or miners, if voter wore gum
boots), and I think —.” “Oh, yes, I’m
goin’ fer ’im olright. Just cross the
other bloke out, will yer? I left me
specs, at home.” Most of them left
their specs, at home that day. One
ancient voted for old Bill and Protec-
tion in the House of Representatives,
and after putting his paper in the ballot
box, came to me with the other docu-
ment. I asked: “How do you vote?
Protection or Freetrade for the Senate? - ’
“Oh, Freetrade, certainly.” So the
Pulsford bunch scored, and thus this
mighty male intellect voted both ways.
1 smiled many timesthat day.
Melbourne Age has begun a quiet
little agitation for the repeal of the
Kailway Trust Lands Acquisition Act.
Syme owns most of the land along the
Lilydale to Warburton railway line.
When a trust was formed under the Act
and lumps of Syme’s property were
acquired for the purposes of the line,
he put in exaggerated claims for com-
pensation. Trenwith was Railway Minister
at the time- and he fought those claims.
The Age then howled for the repeal of the law,
and Trenwith point blank refused to budge,
quoting from Syme’s newspaper to show that it at
one time was an enthusiastic supporter of the
Act. Nothing has passed between Trenwith and
the Age since' then, save objurgations and road
metal.
Sydney Tir.r graph, in a weep about the
prospective retirement of British shipping com-
panies by reason of the Federal Navigation Bill,
supplied some new and remarkable information.
It seems that the trade doesn’t pay, that the
P. and O. and the Orient co. and the others, run
it at a loss—out of philanthropy, and a desire for
fresh air, and a craving to see us occasionally and
to have a look at the scenery. Also that these
companies don’t want any purely coastal trade
here, and never did want it, and haven’t got it,
and will be so mad at losing it through the action
of the new Navigation Law that they will go
away and never coine back.
OLD GRATER ACTIVE.-MONT TOMMY
BENT IN ERUPTION.
This famous old crater exploded recently at
Warracknabeal (Vic.) and threw up a great mass
of adjectives, verbs and interjections. It rained
burnt pronouns and other parts of speech for
many miles round.
When the anti-Socialistic farmers of
Warracknabeal (Vic.) got Bent into a quiet
corner, they immediately pushed at him three
resolutions all advocating straight-out Socialism :
(1) Disapproving of the system of middlemen m
settling people on Crown lands, and desiring the
Government not to part with direct control of
Crown lands, but hold them in trust for the people;
(2) free distribution of seeds and plants for test-
ing soil in different places (Bent promised this) ;
(3) urging the passage of an Adulteration of
Manures Act, and the appointment of an inspec-
tor to carry out its provisions. Either the farmer
is a numbskull who doesn’t know Socialism when
he sees it, or else he knows it is such a good thing
that he wants it all himself and won’t let anyone
else have any.
Governor Le Hunte did more than put
his foot in it after the ordinary mild, guberna-
torial fashion when he started advocating the
introduction of the Bible into S.A. State schools.
He cheerfullv suggested that the Bible Society,
which he was then addressing, should find the
necessary 62,000 Scriptures—presumably in order
that the new system might start at once without
any waste of time in obtaining Parliamentary
sanction. It would be interesting to know if the
parsons who have chewed Le Hunte’s ear so early
in his career clearly informed him that a popular
vote was taken on this matter not very long ago,
and that the decision was flatly against them ;
and that he is talking, not only against the Jaw,
but also against the clearly-expressed will ot the
people.
Worth noting that most of the cases in the
N.S. W. Arbitration Court over which employers
cry out indignantly, arose, not out of breaches
of awards of the court, but of voluntary agree-
ments entered into by employers and em-
ployees, and then registered as rulings of the
court. Employers having come to agree-
ments do not wish to keep them ; that is
the reason of three-fourths of the penalty-
cases.
Launceston (Tas.) hasn’t had an election
for the House of Dodery for 18 years, but next
May there will be two. William Hart died the
other day, but as less than three months would
elapse till an election by effluxion of time, “the
Act ” said no bve-election should take place. In
May, Adye Douglas, the father of the,Tasmanian
bar, and the father of Tasmania for the matter of
that, goes out. He’ll be 89 years old on June 18
next, wears a spoiting white hat, and never rides
in a tram or trap. Douglas is a curious blend of
Tory and Radical. A lot of people at Launceston
think that Douglas ought to represent the Tamar
city till he crosses the floor of the House to the
oreat majority. But Peter M'Crackan, who used
to be a member of the Assembly, is going to tackle
old Adye, and next May Launceston will have a
political razzle such as it hasn’t had within living
memory.
Some miserably crooked business,has been
engineered with Premier Bent in the matter of a
proposed inquiry into “secret commissions”
allowed by the shipping companies to certain
butter export agents in Victoria. These agents
are alleged to have squeezed the companies for a
commission on shipments made by them, and
represented that the said commissions were going
into the hands of the butter producers, whereas
they were really being pocketed by the agents.
The butter producers demanded an inquiry, a,nd
Premier Bent announced that a Royal Commission
was to be appointed for the purpose. After the
lapse of eleven days, when the statement had
been repeated several times, and leading articles
had been published in a large number of news-
papers supporting the appointment of the Com-
mission, Bent broke out in a new place with the
news that the Government never decided to have
a Commission, and that he never said it did.
Six or eight pressmen are prepared to swear to
the contrary, but their voices are drowned by
Bent’s yell.
A wonderful array of Tory talent collected
at Scott’s Hotel to support Money McEacharn in
the fresh election for the Melbourne seat in the
House of Representatives. It was called in the
press “business men’s meeting,” and black-type
headlines were put up about “socialism.
talking wildly about the terrible socialistic
monster that was threatening everyone's liberty,
all present solemnly pledged themselves to the
sacred service of McEacharn. In his most solemn
moments the Tory is always comical. In this case
the comic feature was that not one of the 10
took the solemn pledge has a vote for the
bourne division. No doubt what they meant o
say was that they would do all they could to
coerce their employees living in the city, a “
those occupying their dirty shanties m thesqua 1
portions of Melbourne, to vote for McEacharn.
This was one of the tricks played at the origina
election, upset by the High Court. Evidently i
is to be played again for all it is worth.
George Reid’s Victorian pal, Max Hirsch,
has been badly walloped out by the Court of
Disputed Returns. Max, the excitable German
foreign-trade advocate, petitioned against the
return of Phare/. Phillips, for the Wimmera seat
in the House of Reps. The point taken by Max
was a tricky one. A polling-place at N 1 IN 1 was
not opened on the day of the election. On a sub-
sequent day the poll at Ni Ni was taken, and
Hirsch wanted to take advantage of the absentee
sections of the Electoral Act to enable all his
friends in the electorate who hadn’t past a vote on
the day of the election to record their votes at the
postponed poll at Ni Ni. The High Court decided
that absentees could vote at the postponed poll,
provided they belonged to the locality in which
the poll was postponed and were really absentees
on the date when such poll was taken, lhat, of
course, knocked Max Hirsch*endwise. If he had
secured the whole of the votes entitled to be
recorded at Ni Ni it would have made no differ-
ence to Phillips’ majority. What Hirsch was
after was to bring absentee voters from any part
of the electorate to vote at Ni Ni. Petition dis-
missed.
“’Demos ” has a theory :
Land resumption by the Government as a check on
fraudulent assessments for taxation purposes could only
be fully successful under a determined Treasurer and a
sound Treasury. The law needed is one to require the
assessment of estates in plots of limited area, and to
provide for individuals purchasing through the courts at
a ten per cent, advance on the assessment plus actual
value of improvements.
Not much ! The law most needed is one which
imposes a graduated land-tax running up to 3d.
or 4d. in the £ on very large estates, with 50 per
cent, extra on absentees. When the law is so
fixed that a bit of land which is worth £OOO stand-
ing by itself is only worth £5OO, or £4OO, or £3OO
(by reason of the tax on it) when it is part of a
large estate, the value diminishing as the estate
grows bigger, then the land will cut itself up.
There need be no loans, no worry about pur-
chases, no complicated legal machinery—and the
tax will be bringing in money all the time. JNo
state in Australia has yet tried a land tax heavy
enough to make the holding of big estates in the
fertile parts of the country absolutely unprofit-
able ; if the experiment is only tried it will be
found an infallible remedy while human nature
remains what it is.
COMPULSORY REPURCHASE.
“In speaking at Warracknabeal (Vic. on Saturday,
the Premier (Mr. Bent) announced that the Governtment
would introduce a Compulsory Purchase Bill duinng the
coining session. The compulsory clauses would not be
used while it was possible to deal with owners. No
estate under £20,000 would be touched by compulsory
purchase, and no estate would be purchased except by
resolution of both Houses.”
TOMMY BENT: “ Between you and me, brother,
there’s nothin for you to worry about."
George Reid occupies his usual curious
po3ition°over the Federal Arbitration Bill.. On
the clause which excludes State public servants
from the operations of the Bill, he declares he is
with the Deakin Government, and at the same
time all his trusted lieutenants are battling round
whipping-up votes against the Deakin Govern-
ment. George is supposed to lead the Oppose
tion, and this combination of George Yes and
Opposition No has a curious effect. It suggests a
two-faced George riding both ways at once on a
two-headed horse.

CALLAGHAN & SON, 395 georce st„ Sydney.


“ Tiki,” from Dunedin (M.L.) :
During the Boer war the most ferocious Boer-baiter in
Dick Seddon’s Jingoland was the Dunedin Star, run by
Cohen. The same Cohen is now to the front as the boss
Pro-Monkey. Cohen cannot find space in his columns
for any correspondence that reflects the, least on
yellow pet, or that hints at the linprobabilitj of him
being able to permanently flatten out the Bear. Bu
then kirk-ridden, humorless Dunedin is violentlj yellow
in this contest. The Black Brigade has opened an anti-
Bear campaign from the pulpits, and tells that if there
is any animal that smells sweet in the nostrils of the
Lord it is the Monkey.
From ’Frisco Wasp, pointing to the
coming Yellow Peril:
It will not be so easy to exclude the Japanese from
California as the Federation of Labor seems to think. If
Japan is not afraid to try conclusions with so great a
power as Russia, which can put three millions of men in
the field, she might be rash enough to cope with tne
United States. A war with Japan would not be a very
desirable thing for this Coast, for she has a powerful
fleet, which grows more so every year. While she could
make no impression on the United States with any army
she could raise, she might do a great deal of damage to
Coast cities and commerce.
If the United States feels a bit of uneasiness as
to the Japanese power, what about Australia .
And yet our press is just now barracking freu-
?iedly for the Yellow Man’s cause.
“Dead Earth ” remarks :
Your recent par. about the testimonial cadge and
curse in the civil services of Australia was well timed.
As a case in point : I know pf a N.S.W. country post-
master in receipt of next to nothing a year, who lately re-
ceived from headquarters a cordial invitation to subscribe
to a testimonial to retiring Deputy Postmaster-General
Dalgarno (salary £920 per annum). Now, if Mr. Dalgarno
was aware of and permitted this cadge, in what way did
his position differ from that of any ordinary mendicant
who is run in by the police for asking coppers in the
street ? The only difference I can see is that he haon t
the excuse of poverty ; he didn’t need the coppers. That
ought to aggravate the offence. If a poor man, for
begging from a rich one, gets three months, how much
(supposing Mr. Dalgarno was in any way responsible for
the business) should a comparatively rich man get for
begging from poor men ?

The Go-on-the-Land Rot.
“ Steve ” on the rot above-mentioned :
From one end of Australia to the other the shoddy-
graphists of the daily press are constantly advising the
people at large and the unemployed in particular to “go
on the land.” Moreover, the said shoddies incessantly
urge the various Governments to “settle the people on
the land ” that they may “ develop our vast natural
resources.” Probably not one of these parrots ever
stopped his screeching to consider how to get the people
on the land. Bight from the North sugar districts of
Queensland down the coast and inland, all the arable
lands are practically monopolised. Certainly there
are areas still open for selection, but the distances
from markets are a bar to their being profit-
ably cultivated even if the fear of drought was not
ever present. On the coastal rivers and districts and in
the accessible inland districts of N.S.W. land monopoly
reigns supreme. Victoria is in even a worse state, while
the deserts of South Australia and Western ditto may be
left out of the question. In any of the States mentioned,
even where Crown land is available, just consider what
going on the land means. First, application and waiting.
Next, survey fees ; then implements, stores, etc., fares for
self and family to selection, a tent or hut or house to be
erected, land to be cleared and fenced—probably
two years hard toil before a crop goes in. Then a small
crop and more fencing and grubbing and clearing. Three
years labor toiling all hours before any return is secured
i.e. if seasons are favorable. All of which means from £l5O
to £3OO cash outlay, not to speak of labor and hardship. If
seasons fail, a mortgage to the storekeeper, a few j’ears
struggling on to disaster, and a submerged cocky and
family reduced to the level of serfs. Go for freehold, and
a man needs to have a small fortune to start without a
mortgage and an interest burthen. What hope has the
average citizen, employed or unemployed, of securing the
freehold of sufficient dairying land at £l5 an acre, or
sugar or wheat land at £3, £4, or £5 per acre cash down ?
Certainly the several Governments have made faint
al tempts to resume suitable areas, but they are as a drop
in the bucket, and without advances to build, clear, fence
and crop, are of no use to the city dweller and unem-
ployed, even if said dwellers and unemployed had farming,
dairying, or other agricultural knowledge or experience.
The third and the worst opening is to rent land from one
of the large landlords. Whether this is done straight out
or on the shares—halves or tribute--system, the result is
the same. Instead of “ a sturdy yeomanry ” (to use the
phrase of the press cacklers) being established “as a
backbone to the country” (more cackle), this system
simply settles a horde of serfs or helots, who live and
have their being at their landlords’ beck and nod. To
finish.with the “go on the land” rot. At present,
cockying of all kinds is a precarious occupation. Dairying
and sugar-growing-—the first, because it is not overdone ;
the second, because it is buttressed with Protective
duties—are a shade better. When they reach the turning
point, and arrive where wheat-growing now is—what
then ? Consider present prices of produce, and that very
soon in every line Australia will have a large surplus to
export in competition with stuff produced with cheaper
labor and off more fertile land in countries nearer to
Europe. Down come prices, and with them agriculture
at large. Will the purblind cacklers who are yelling to
settle thousands on the land consider these things, and
give us a rest? While resting, they might consider
schemes to throw land in good situations open, help
settlers to go on it cheaply, and provide local markets,
per Protective duties, for the produce.
Victoria’s dilapidated railways have got so
far on the road to ruin that even the easy-going
shire health officers are now sniffing suspiciously
at station buildings. The station-master’s house
atLyndhurst was lately condemned as uninhabit-
able by the Dandenong officer, but the Depart-
ment stdl charges a high rent for the “ dwelling ”
to its sweated servant.
Years ago, the head of a N.S.W. Govern-
ment Department appointed his son as a junior,
I hat son’s promotion was of the meteoric order.
If a vacancy occurred three steps above the son,
the head would send for the two obstructionists
and inform them that he did not consider them
capable of filling the vacant position, but, to save
t-iem the humiliation of his having to say so, he
would advise them to decline the position. They
always did so, and the son went up the ladder
t.’ree steps at a time. The man who knows the
right time to be a son has a future before him.
London Spectator on the Chinese inva-
sion of the Rand :
The passport system of residence in eraastula, and the
orcible repatriation, make it a system of slavery ; and as
the Chinese never' submit to slavery, there will be the
possibility of rebellion followed by bloodshed. Moreover,
as the Chinese Government will certainly reject such
terms for their people, we run the danger of seeing the
oi l system of kidnapping, with its accompanying horrors
?„r!!!hV! y °'r board S , hip -’ ? nce nio r e revived. If we cannot
enrich the Transvaal without this plunge back into bar-
barism—which we do not believe-the Transvaal must
stay poor.
A return tabled in the House of Reps.,
the other day, shows that, so far, 44,117 persons
have been admitted to the Commonwealth under
the Alien Immigration Restriction Act: 352 have
been excluded, comprising 2 Africans, 2 colored
Americans, 1 Arab, 2 British subjects, 8 Cape
Verde Islanders, 3 Chilians, 99 Chinese, 6 Cinga-
lese, 6 French subjects, 4 Greeks, 5 Hindus 1
Mauritian, 1 colored Portuguese subject, 5 South
Sea Islanders, 5 West Indians, and 2 not specified,
in all, 13 colored persons passed the educational
test, comprising 1 Assyrian, 2 Cingalese, 1 East
Indian, 2 Eurasians, 2 Hindus, 1 Japanese, 1
Maori and 3 West Indians ; and they form about
the best 13 arguments against that test that The
Bulletin lias so far met with.
S u ig e ry is coming along. A Crookwell
(JN.S.W.) medical man, assisted by a Goulburn
ditto, opened up the side of a phthisis patient
lecently, and drained the diseased lung of several
pints of pus. The patient has progressed satis-
factorily since. _ Though this is probably the
first case of its land in Australia, the well-known
-Ur. Godlee, of London, has carried out several
similar operations successfully of late. Said that
the new method of treating phthisis holds out
hope for even the most advanced cases.
The Natal Mercury thus laments in a far
country:
Can Australia be surprised at antipathy being shown
to some of their compatriots in South Africa when we
read of proposed legislation such as that put forward bv
iiSiiSfrtli P T art>: ‘“NewSouth Wales, which seeks now to
abolish the Legislative Council, to abolish State Governor-
ship, and to abolish public borrowing? This “down-
with-every thing procedure in the Australian colonies
s repugnant to enterprise, and has driven many able men
from those colonies. ... We do not want Australian
political methods here.
this is the first N.S. Wales has heard about its
Liabor party declaring against borrowing. It is
to be hoped the glad news will shortly be con-
firmed.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
It is announced by Foster that the M. 0.0. lost
considerably on the tour of Warner’s team. Unfavorable
weather affected the takings on several occasions, but so
also did the funereal style of batting on both sides.
Neither team had a Jessop to draw a crowd. Warner’s
team came out to win, and played to win, but it was not
the sort of combination to score at the turnstiles.
* * * »
Warner, being banqueted by E. T. Smith (after
the latter’s long-standing custom) on his last evening in
Australia, encouraged S. A. to believe that it would have
five men in the Australian team next year—naming Hill,
Gehrs, Newland, Claxton, and Jennings. Difficult to see,
however, how room could be found for Hill, Gehrs and
Jennings besides Trumper, Duff and McAlister and two
wicket-keepers—eight batsmen chosen before the bowling
begins to be considered.
* * * *
The debt of over £BOO, which lay like a whited
sepulchre at the door of the S.A. Cricket Association at
the beginning of the season, has been wiped off mainly
through the visit of the English team.
* * * *
That awful person, the cricket analyst, has been
hard at work ever since England won the rubber proving
that the Australians were really the better cricketers.
The latest discovery is that, because in the five tests the
Englishmen scored 2333 runs from 5572 balls, and the
Australians 2424 from 4803, our men were the more dash-
ing batsmen. Perhaps so, but all the figures and
decimals in creation don’t alter the fact that England
won, and this brooding over the debris is a sorry waste
of intellect. The ashes are gone, and no amount of hol-
lering into the empty urn will alter that sombre truth.
* * * *
Considering the shrewd common sense dis-
played by Warner as captain, the announcement that he
is going to write a book comes as a shock. The effusion
will probably wreck the bald-headed skipper’s reputa-
tion.
• * * *
Warner’s departed cricketers showed in the last
match of their tour that they could do as they liked with
S’Australia. They had previously made a holy show of
Victoria and a respectable exhibition of N.S.W. In a
number of minor outside matches they pulled the enemy’s
leg, just as the Australians in England pull the leg of the
weaker counties, playing indifferently for the first half of
the game, and doing “ all they know” when there is any
leeway to make up. No previous Eleven from England
was equal to Warner’s lot in the power to pull itself
together when the game seemed to be going against it.
• * * *
The cricket insanity has struck N.Q. hard.
Charters Towers has clubs called respectively the “ Bleed-
ing Duffs,” the “ What Ho, Elijahs,” and the “ Come On
Dowies.” Trade matches are such as Knives (Butchers)
v. Razors (Barbers), or Mullockers v. Truckers.
*■* * *
Warner’s team put in its last day at Adelaide
playing British football (“Socker”) against a club that
struggles along in that city. Three or four of the
Englishmen knew nothing of the game, but those who
did completely overmatched the local men, and scored 7
to nil in an hour’s play. The lengthy Foster, who was
supposed to defend the goal-posts, grew tired of doing
nothing, and going forward instead, kicked three of the
goals himself.
Sydney first-grade cricket interest ceased sud-
denly on Saturday. On that fatal afternoon North
Sydney was belted by the Glebe by 37 runs, Waverley
played a draw with Leichhardt-Balmain, and Burwood
downed Redfern with 154 to the good. This left Burwood
with 10 competition points and its nearest rival, Glebe,
with only four. There is only one round to play. If
Glebe beats Sydney, the butcher suburb will only have
six points; and even if Burwood goes down before
Waverley, Waverley will have but four points and Burwood
will still head the list with eight. So, no matter what
happens, Burwood wins the season’s premiership. Top
position would probably have been occupied by North
Sydney had it not produced or owned so many cham-
pions; Buff, Hopkins and Hickson come from there, and
while they battled for the ashes their club was being
. belted in their absence by other electorates which did
not produce champions. Moral: In electoral cricket, do
not produce champions.
* * * •
The glory of Australian cricket may have de-
parted, and the boxing kangaroo lie slugged out by the
Yankee, but at swimming we still hold the pot-plants.
World records have been tumbling around like ninepins
lately, and the Australasian Championship meeting
should prove itself an annual event. At the third
carnival, at the Coogee Aquarium (Sydney), on Wednes-
day last week Dick Cavill again met Keran, this time in
the 440yds., for which Cavill held the record-time of
sinin. 28 l-ssec., made in Newcastle, March 2nd, 1902.
They got away together. Keran went to the front, only
to be overtaken in the fourth lap, and.they led alternately
till, in the 17th lap, they kicked off simultaneously.
Cavill made a tremendous effort and shot away, winning
by two yards from Keran in smin. 26sec.—2 l-ssec. less
than his own world record It was a great victory, but a
costly one. The effort had been beyond his strength, and
Caviil had strained his back, so that Saturday found him
suffering from lumbago, and quite unable to appear in
the final carnival at Bondi.
Consequently the mile championship on
Saturday was much shorn of interest; never-
theless, every bit of available space was occupied by
sightseers, and it was announced that Keran would
endeavor to break George Read’s figures for the distance,
put up in Woolloomooloo Bay nearly three years ago.
The ouly other competitors were C. N. Smith (N.S.W.)
and F.-W. Springfield (Q.), both mere schoolboys. From
the start Keran streaked away through the clear, green
water, and the two schoolboys battled for second place.
Reran gained yards every lap, and. the boys
led one another alternately till the three-quarters was
passed, when Smith left 'the 'water. Springfield
gamely went on after the man who travelled like a
Brennan torpedo. Keran finished 125 yards to the good
in 24min. 36 l-ssec. Another world’s record-has gone
broke, the time being lOsec. less than Read’s. The
plucky Queensland boy did it in 26min. 31 3-ssec. Had
Cavill been present and in good condition, the contest
would have been the most exciting Australia had ever
seen. But Cavill had neglected to train, held -Jiis
opponents too cheaply, and when he struck that hard,
refractory proposition, Keran, his carelessness found him
out.
•*' ■ * *
Although South Sea Island boy Wickham won
the 100 yards championship race at Boridi oil Saturday,
his time (60sec.) was not a record. Dick Cavill did
it in 68sec. at Farmer’s baths, Sydney, in January, 1904
(the record that has not yet been officially passed). It
was l-sth worse than Fred Lane’s figures, put up at
Leicester (Eng.) in 1902, but beat Joey Nut tail’s world’s
professional 61£sec. and Lemoyne’s American 61 2-ssec.
So although not the fastest, it was a very creditable per-
formance, and would have been much speedier if Wick-
ham hadn't swum a most erratic course across the bath,
instead of going straight down to win. If Wickham
could only learn to swim with his head there would be
possibilities about him.

“R.A.K.”: About that unkind jibe at our
beloved Yarra (B , 17/3/’O4) re the new-born Australian
Henley. As a patriotic Melbourneite, I object to mullock
being poked at our winding stream. Of course it’s not
an Amazon or a Mississippi, but it can give the parent
Henley site some points. Our river is pretty well as
broad as the Thames at this point, and the banks, instead
of being flat and even, are splendidly adapted for holding
a large crowd and giving everybody a view. The Yarra
has certainly never dried up within the memory of man,
which is more than old pa Thames can say, for not many
years ago a cricket match was played on the bed of the
river at Teddington, about 10 miles as the crow flies from
the Tower Bridge. Leaning over Princes Bridge on a dark
night, and watching the city lights gleam on the dark,
broad, swiftly-rushing waters, and thinking of all the
suicides that have been borne along under the dark
arches and all who are to come, provides one of the few
thrills remaining hereabouts. If we haven’t got a Yar-
bour, please leave us our Yarra !
• * * *
Melbourne’s first annual regatta —the Australian
Henley, vide programme transpired last Saturday.
From a sporting point of view, it was a choice function ;
as an imitation of Henley-on-Thames week it was a gaudy
farce —it wouldn’t even pass as a parody of that joyous
carnival. Above Princes Bridge the “ authorities ” had
planted half-a-mile of galvanised iron-sheeting, carefully
erected with the corrugations lengthwise, so that the übi-
quitous small boy could step easily up and roost on top.
(Barbed wire and a large policeman prevented him getting
down into the sacred area inside.) Half-a-crown was
charged to this reserve, but a better view could be
obtained free from the bridge and the approaches. The
one novel item, the thing that was to distinguish this
from the common everyday regatta, that was to make it
swell, swagger, superior, Hinglish, and overwhelming,
was the fleet of house-boats. Alas 1 those who have seen
Henley’s house-boats—those gorgeous, or cosy, or free-
and-easy floating homes, where genius, notoriety, stage
stars, and rich nonentities keep house for a week —
must have shrieked with scorn as they beheld the five
“house-boats” moored in a solemn line just ten paces
apart. As a matter of fact, they were just common, or
mud, punts, with a rough pine staging on deck, lightly
dressed in art muslin. After all the preparations, the
anticipatory advertising—just a second-hand hired punt,
dolled up like a peep-show to-day, and to-morrow carting
away the slush as usual from the depths of the Yarra!
Certainly, one genuine house-boat pervaded the scene—
an ancient steam launch with its engines removed —but
it was occupied by a lively push of quite unrepresentative
citizens, who gave a pleasing though subdued imitation
of Cockney ’Arrv’s capers. By the way, the affair was
hon. secretaried by one Rivett, a capting, of whom
somebody remarks that “ his methods afford no
ground for compliment.” A sec. of that sort is a grave
mistake. Unless the press gives the names of house-boat
owners and their guests, etc., there won’t be any house-
boats in future. But the racing was good, and the huge
crowd outside the “reserve” enjoyed seeing H. Bourke,
of Launce3ton, walk off with the Challenge Sculls, and
the Ballarat R.C. (mostly manual workers) win the
“Eights” for the third time, having previously beaten
all comers at the Barwon and Ballarat regattas.
* * * *
N.B.W. Rowing Association regatta on Parra-
matta River (Sydney), Saturday, was an ideal outing.
The river was dotted over with craft of every shape and
size, and yet old hands shook their heads and said in-
terest in rowing was dead. If it is the blame cannot be
laid to the surroundings or the oarsmen. Sydney’s
victory over Glebe in the Champion Eights by 19sec. was
moderately easy, but Mercantile and Balmain Enterprise
put up a fine tussle in the Senior-Junior Fours. The
Enterprisers were stronger and heavier, but, apparently,
were not accustomed to swivel rowlocks, and the result
was that a number of crabs were caught. While the
Balmain crew was struggling with the unexpected fish,
Sydney won the race.

Hundreds of people, from all parts of Maori-
land, travelled to Wanganui to see the first meeting
between the cracks Achilles and Machine Gun in the
classic Jackson Stakes. Both broke all track records
prior to the meeting, but on the day it was boggy, and
Achilles won an3’how, Machine Gun being last in a field
of four. Stead’s crack couldn’t get along at all in the
mud. Geo. Clifford’s filly, Chryseis, which couldn’t be said
to have a 100 to 1 chance of beating Machine Gun under
ordinary conditions, ran a meritorious second. Which
just shows what may happen sometimes in a classic
event. Geo. Clifford often starts neddies which haven’t
the remotest show—for pure sport, to make a field, and
induce clubs to keep events on their programmes.

Orack trotting pony, Major Taylor, was bred by
Mr. Robt. Eckford at Moree (N.S.W.) and is a gelding ;

Major Taylor, with a sulky attached, bolted three miles.

Rosehill Nursery Handicap (Saturday) intro-
duced something worth having “ a bit on ” at the right
time in the Lochiel —Dona filly, Flora McDonald, trained
by Tom Payten. She is a sister to that whilom con-
sistently good performer and Caulfield Cup winner (1899)
Dewey. Flora McDonald’s dam has foaled every year but
ohe during the past 13, and among others given the turf
Dowry, The Maine, and Jacobite.

Two Manawatu district (M.L.) farmers were in
luck at recent Wanganui Cup meet. Particularly sweet
oh Ghoorka’s chance for the big thing they toted the nag
to the extent of £so' and'stooped verging on £5OO. Four
other winners were subsequently “spotted” and each
brought a big div. As it would perhaps take years of
hard graft to clear what the pair gathered in a few days
by betting, they’ll probably keep going at the game until
they get tied in a financial knot—it’s the usual sequel of
a stroke of luck, at least as far as-backing horses is con-
cerned.

Backers of favorite (Sir Faust) in Carlingford
Mile at Rosehill Saturday had hard luck indeed, and
Israel dropped in for that windfall which of ten goes Israel’s
way in the most desperate situation. Outsider Chere
Amie, who had (heavily backed) failed badly earlier in
the day, just pipped Sir Faust on the post by a head
through Barden allowing his mount to slow down. ’Twas
a repetition of the same jockey’s experience with Long
Tom in the last Summer Cup, which Bridegroom won.

Randwick touts are gone on M.L. filly Glad-
some’s galloping powers. That animal is of the low,
thick-set order, apparently nothing above 15 hands, and,
considering the racing and travelling done by her
during the past five months, looks remarkably well.
Saturday last saw Gladsome give convincing evidence of
speed ; negotiating 7fur. in 1.30, she made a record for
Randwick course proper, and consequently wiped out
the best Cruciform did six months ago. The little lady’s
prospects for A.J.C. Autumn meet are consequently
more than promising, and she’ll probably carry stacks of
coin first time of lining up.
Other sections of the Commonwealth came very
mn oh to the support of S. Australia s big things uooa

A duskv runner, named Isaacs, recently won a
bi- foot ra^ e up North, and his party landed a good
stake. He was financed by two of the Chosen, and his
name pulled him through. „
Footracing is booming in Brisbane, and the
usual “rin-insr in” is proceeding apace. Kecentiy
several aboriginal runners have scooped the pool (or ttiem
gaffers have scooped it), and most of them are shrevunj
suspected of being Charlie Samuels or hingsmtll in dis
guise. As one nij. is mostly like another mg., it s hard
to sort them out. At the same time, it hasi beeni yv s y
pointed out that if three aboriginals are tether they
can’t all be Samuels, no matter how much he may be
disguised. , *
“ Plain Bill ” : What’s this about cricket being
the Australian national game ? What’s the matter with
“two-up”? The principles of this.noble game are in-
stilled into the mind of the Australian from earliest
childhood, and its adherents in all classes, young wia ® >
are numberless. From the nipper backblox Sundaj
“ school ” with a boy “ keepin’ nit ” at either end, to the
patrons of the big city dens, and away to the shearing
sheds, navvies’ and drovers’ camps of the furthermost
out-back, the game that has the greatest hold on young
Australia is “two-up,” and wherever a few of us are
gathered together with money in our pockets there also
will be the two pennies and the kip.

Dear Bulletin. — Did you ever note the move-
ments of the professional pigeon obliterator when he walks
out to extirpate a stupified bird cooped in a trap a few yards
from his mark ? Watched one the other day. He took
four sups of whisky (anymore might destroy his aim),
tightened his belt, took his expensive Gatling and care-
fully loaded it. Then he laid £1 to 10s. that he would
kill with the first barrel, and a wave of expectation
thrilled the onlookers. He walked out bravely to his
mark, like Napoleon crossing the Alps, brought the gun
to his shoulder and swept the horizon. The shoulder
wasn’t satisfactory. So he tried again. “Gordelpus.
said the bookmaker. “ Pull!” said the assassin. Down
went the centre trap, and a light-colored pigeon hopped
out and started to pick up grass seeds. “Save the
cartridge,” said the fielder ; “ kill him with a stick.
The secretary admonished him severely for disturbing
the shooter. A boy bowled a wooden ball at the bird, and
it rose slowly. Then the gun blasted the atmosphere,
and the victim fell, the shooter covering it ready to use
the second barrel if it attempted to fly away and dis-
honestly remove the Jib. of shot he had put into it.
After that he walked proudly back to the pavilion, and
the other Nimrods cheered vociferously. The bookmaker
paid the half-sovereign ; then went and sat on the fence,
with his lower lip hanging like a pelican's pouch.
•* Ain’t yer goin’ to bet?” said the next champion waiting
at the gate. “ Blime ! ” said the fielder, “ I’ll take even
money myself and kill a crateful of ’em with a catapult.
They’re ’arf dead.”—Marat.

Coursing agony started afresh at Belmore (Syd-
ney) Thursday' and Friday last week, and will be inflicted
weekly the next five months. Opening show was any-
thing but edifying. Dogs generally were not half trained,
while hares weren’t trained at all, and mostly shaped as
if they had just been dumped down 6n the ground for
that particular meeting ; also conditions underfoot were
hard as flint, and weather hot enough to render the sport
still more cruel than it ordinarily is. Stock of hares ran
out before any of the finals could be decided, conse-
quently' every stake (four) resulted in a division. The
general depression which the event caused was intensified
by the fact that the manager, who took the usual
siipper’s place on an emergency, was dragged over by a
couple of dogs, and sustained a dislocated shoulder and
two broken ribs. Belmore’s shutters ought to go up
after this.

Hock Keys-Monty Andrews fight at Sydney
National S.C. was exceptionally clever and exciting
throughout. Sydney hasn’t, for some time, seen a match
so even, so skilful (most of the time), and so pregnant
with incident. Only twice (in the second and twelfth
rounds) was either on the floor, and he (it was Keys each
time) rose on the moment and was into the thick of it
immediately. Andrews often appeared to be doing con-
siderable work when he really did nothing that would
count, though it worried Keys a lot, for he was hustled
and roughed—pushed mostly. Keys fell weak at times,
and looked like collapsing ere the round closed, but he
pulled himself together remarkably—his fine science
standing to him the while—and then notched points very
quickly. Once, when sagging and oscillating ominously,
and apparently an easy prey for the enemy, Keys side-
stepped a fierce rush beautifully, and Andrews ran head-
long into the ropes. At the close of 60mins. (20 rounds)
fighting the referee declared in favor of Keys (a good ver-
dict), and the bulk of the house applauded, while some
dissented. They will meet again if Keys beats Casey in
a match now pending.

Struggle in Melbourne Monday night between
Jack McGowan and Charlie Frost for lightweight bruising
honors of Victoria was a bitter 20-round fight. McGowan
got the verdict although he suffered the major portion of
the thumping and showed it, but his swings and hooks,
flooring Frost frequently, were probably a big factor in
bringing him the decision. Those who saw Frost oppose
Tim Hegarty in Sydney recently will be surprised at him
cutting anything even near with a pug of McGowan’s
reputation, for then he made a poor showing indeed.
McGowan and Frost met before at Sydney National S.C.,
and Frost did all the scoring till Mac got the long waited
opening for his right and Frost was sent out suddenly.

Old-time bare knuckle and glove fighter, Peter
Newton, benefited in Melbourne last week, and long
laid aside through physical incapacity for work, is
just 50. He was a great performer in his day, doing
best at 9.8. The ’7o’s saw Peter settle Jack Finlev
in 30mins., “ Dubbo ” in 37mins., “Flash Patsey ”
in 30mins., and Fred Scott in 32mins. : and 22 years since
he knocked out Melbourne blacksmith, Farnan (since
dead), who beat Peter Jackson. Fights with Hicken and
other lights of the punching game followed. Peter was a
high-class bruiser, and one who didn’t hesitate to concede
a couple of stone occasionally sooner than lose the chance
of a match. Present-time champions haggle over ounces.
Peter’s position seems to be the fate of most of his calling,
unless a pub comes to the rescue.

Football is in the air. Clubs are bolding annual
meetings and the sheep are being enrolled for the
slaughter. Also, preparations are being made for the
slaughter to be witnessed in greater comfort. The
people who run University Oval, Sydney, are adding to
the grandstand and providing separate rooms where each
side can resuscitate out its own players without inter-
ference from the side which laid them out.

As an essay on the cussedness. of things in
general the fact that the Sydney Thousand final was
fixed for last (Wednesday) night, after this valuable paper
had gone to press, takes a lot of beating. Taylor
and MacFarland displayed great generalship in the
winning of their semi-final heats. They both caught the
front bunches at the bell. Farley came at the long
Yankee, but MacFarland shot through and won by a
length. Taylor, having caught up, dropped into second
position and let the others make the pace ; then he won
by the usual jump from the ladies’ pavilion by two
lengths. MacFarland’s time was lmiri. 59 l-ssec., and
Taylor’s lmin. 58 l-ssec.
» * * *
The beating of Major Taylor by Floyd Mac-
Farland in the Kent Plate mile scratch race on Saturday
night was a splendid exhibition of skilful riding while
travelling at a dizzy speed. The other starters were Don
Walker and Hardy Dow ning. Gudgeon, Farley, and Ftl-
sell, about three of the fastest pacers on the continent.
each led a lap in the order named, and Tavlor was leading
on the inside when the pacers dropped out at the hell.
Downing dashed up 'O Taylor and tried to break n\v:n,
and Taylor fought him right round to the members stand,
where Downing’s steam gave out. MacFarland swung
with a splendid sprint, and Taylor realised that he was
being double-banked. But he was game and whirled his
feet in a manner that was good to see for 30}ds., wne
MacFarland got in front. Taylor tried to hang on to ms
wheel, but Mac. got a clear length ahead, and then he
flashed down the slope and took the inside running,
that Taylor’s amazing final jump would have to he on
the outside. Taylor did jump, as he never jumped
before in Sydney, and amid thunders of applause came
right up to the long fellow’s pedal. But it was hopeless ,
the “Handicap King” had put on a terrific pace, and
Taylor never got past that pedal. He finished there.
The time (lmin. 53 3-ssec.) was fast, but not equal io
MacFarland’s own time (lmin. 49sec.) in the Mosniai
Mile, the previous week. Taylor did not start in tne
mile scratch, but MacFarland did, and won it in lum .
36 4-ssec.
* * * *
Major Taylor is anxious to meet MacFarland
singly for £lOO on Sydney C.G. track. The race would
be a most popular fixture, blit if it does eventuate tm
paper backs Ham. MacFarland’s win of the Kent 1 lat
was really due to Downing having exhausted_ laylor in
the wild cat struggle from the bar end of the shining
stand to the Members’Pavilion, and to the promptness
with which Mac. swooped down on the inside running
immediately he was a length ahead. Man to man, Ham
is the boss wheelist in Australia these days.

Play in the ninth tennis match, Victoria v.
South Australia, on Adelaide Jubilee Oval, Saturdaj,
surprised Victorians, who left Dunlop and Brooks at
home under the impression that they had a soft thing.
Harbison, who hasn’t shaped in Adelaide for years, was
one' of the home side, and he, after a close tussle right
through, beat Tatchell—easily the best Victorian. Old
form came back to Bowen and Baker, who scored from
visitors Saxon and Barnard handily,, but Tatchell and
Barnard were too good for the home pair in the doubles,
beating them practically on one stroke in a magnificent
game. Then Harbison and Taylor accounted for Saxon ana
Heath. Victorian ladies’ team only secured one game that
afternoon, and the Crow-eater State petticoated reps,
won both doubles. Miss Payne (S.A.), among Australia s
finest lady players, was much in evidence —Miss Addison
never had a hope with her. Contest concluded Monday,
Victoria winning ladies’ and gentlemen’s matches easily.

Coming Easter week will see the biggest
gathering of bowlers in one centre Australia has ever
known. Maoriland, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania
are sending teams, and 75 N.S.W. reps, have been
chosen to oppose them. The selection spreads over --
clubs —City contributing the greater number (5), and the
others from i down to 1 each.

Victorian bowling pennant tourney, concluded
Saturday, saw Armadale Club make a record for that
State, and equal Petersham (N.S.W.) Club’s achievement
accomplished last year by winning the big honor and the
“B ” competition. Final of the pennant was between
Armadale and Essendon Clubs. Latest is the fifth Hme
Arr ladale has gathered club supremacy, and the second
oci asion in succession the Pennant has gone its way
wi hout one defeat.
(Continued on page 29.)
Though it isn’t game to say it itself, the
S.M. Herald is letting its country correspon-
dents hint that the Electoral Commissioners
(Judge Murray, Statistician Coglilan, and Curry,
Under-Secretary for Lands) are corrupt. For
example:—“Every electorate around is clipped
to preserve Ballina, the seat of a Cabinet Minis-
ter and— “The Ministei-ial supporters at Bal-
lina, Tweed, and Richmond have, by a singular
coincidence, been favored in all the divisions, while
the Opposition members in Lismore and Tenter-
field, by an equally remarkable coincidence, will
have to contest the next election under weighty
handicaps.” Why does the Herald meanly allow
these miserable innuendoes ? If it wants to say
that these three highly-placed and perfectly inde-
pendent officers are grossly corrupt, why doesn t
it say so plainly and do a public service by
proving the charge? The miserable smirch-
ing of men’s characters in this underhand
fashion is disgusting. It is also shamefully
unfair. If the old Ballina electorate, held by a
Government supporter, is left intact, so in the
same part of the State have the Opposition dis-
tricts of Tenterfield, Armidale, Glen limes,
Tamwortli and Newcastle East. All these have
been treated in exactly the same way as Ballina
made up to the required size by “ tacks” of parts
of adjoining districts. .

A woman who seems to have found very
httle joy in her married life applied for a divorce
in .Sydney last week. One of her experiences
consisted in living for 12 months in a tent in
the hush, and on another occasion she put in a
ong spell of wood-chopping for the support of
her family, At the date of her application she
had been joined in holy matrimony with an in-
toxicated counter-jumper for 27 years, and the
court decided that she deserved her release.
When Tory employers try to rush Austra-
lian farmers and producers into the ranks of those

cry of Down with Socialism ! ” said farmers and
producers ought to think hard over this clause in

ment 2 °
With a view to assisting wherever possible those en-
gaged m the cultivation of the soil, and as a preliminary
to the establishment of an agricultural bureau, you will
be invited to consider the best means of assisting the
farmer, by bounties and otherwise, to grow new crops
and find new markets. Speedier and cheaper transporta-
tmn to the large centres of population of meat, butter,
and fruit under improved conditions is much to be
desired.
That’s rank Socialism sure enough.
Billson, M.L.A., of Fitzroy (Vic.), got;
down to solid business when interviewing Premier
Bent lately on an “umemployed” deputation.
roaring out that he couldn’t start many
much-needed works on an empty treasury and.
that he couldn t borrow in a market at £92, Bent
glared at the deputation and yelled “Where am I
to get the money?” Billson replied, “You are
not placing us in a fair position when you put that
question. If you find it impossible to carry on the
government of the State as it should be carried on
nnd ask the members of the Labor party to take
the position, I am qunte prepared to-morrow to.
wi° lt- T ? ent ’ ‘‘ Tbat is not n ‘y question.
Where am I to get the-money ? ” Billson, “ Adopt-
business methods; nationalise the tobacco in-
dus'ry and put on a land tax.” Bent opened his
mouth to roar again, but. changed his mind and
closed the orifice..

A hard, ugly-looking bib of rock has been
heaved m Victoria at the silly crowd just now
bawling out for the cramming of immigrants into
Australia. Lately two vacancies for laborers
at the Government House gardens were advertised
m the morning papers. Before 9 o’clock over 200
men made application for the jobs, and when the
day was over it was found that over 300 had been
in search of them. The wages were 7s. a day.
Still, the Tory position in shouting for immigra-
tion is understandable. If there had been 600 men
applying for the jobs instead of 300 there would
be a big chance of the 7s. a day being very soon
reduced to 3s. a day.
Miles Flynn, one of the nine men who
escaped for a few hours from the Dry Creek
Stockade (S.A.), made an impassioned appeal
before the justices who tried him for gaol-breaking
saying he wished to escape to have his trial re-
vmwed. Flynn is serving 20 years for a highway
robbery that was never conclusively proved against
mm. His defence was a remarkable alibi, which
one of the Crown witnesses was prepared to sup-
Lawson, convicted with Flynn, said he
hadn t seen the latter for eight months before the
robbery, though he acknowledged his own guilt.
As .r lynn said, he was sent to gaol because of his
previous bad character. Another of the escapees
setupths novel defence that he was dissatisfied
with the gaol doctor, and wished to seek outside
medical advice.
Likenesses of local detectives are found in
several houses in Sydney, and are quite common
in the hands of people suspected of living by their
wits. Sydney detectives never did try hard to
conceal their identity, but the liberal parting with
their photos looks too big a concession to the
criminal, class. They might as well wear uniforms

Are \}ou quite sure
you are enjoying the exact Tobacco that suits you, or are you simply
smoking on, the same old pipe that you have smoked for years -because,
you've smoked it for years ? If you are the least little bit inclined to make a
change, do it now, for never in the history of Tobacco manufacture was
there such a wonderful improvement, both in the growing of the leaf and in
the making of the tobacco therefrom.
You would be pleasantly surprised to find that m
HAVELOCK Tobacco
you had found something far and away better than anything you had dreamt
of. There is no brand in the World that is so alluring in flavour and solid
in quality as ** Havelock/' and one trial would convince you, that there
is more real satisfaction and pleasure to be got out of smoking a genuine
tobacco than you were aware of.
Try a Plug or a Tin of “ Havelock" Tobacco. Smoke it, say, for a month,
and then see if anything would tempt you to go back to any other brand,

“ Ex-Australian ” writes from the land
which our ancestors wisely quitted :
I gather from the Red Page (17/12/’O3) that snobbery is
bestirring itself in Sydney. I have just had 12 months’
experience of the beastly thing in a small English country
town. It is a dull hole, and could only be made pleasant
by the sociability of its inhabitants, which quality
doesn’t exist. Local society is divided, broadly speaking,
into four classes —the laborers (who touch their caps
and say “ Sir ” when spoken to) ; the tradespeople
(minutely subdivided, some businesses being considered
less degrading than others); the professional class
(despising the traders and aspiring to equality with the
swell mob); and finally the swell mob—landed gentry,
gentlemen farmers, and the like, who ignore the
laborers, despise the tradespeople, and patronise the
professional crowd hn not sure that the Anglican
parson ought not to oe in a class by himself —he is such
an extra special snob, since he professes to serve the
Carpenter of Nazareth, and would rather be found dead
than dining with anyone below the rank of a doctor.
Nonconformity is, of course, a bar to any social recog-
nition by the “ upper ” class, and is considered almost as
abominable as trade. I don’t find that the peasantry
grovel—they don’t expect to be treated as being of the
same flesh and blood as other men, and so don’t seek for
any kind of civility. The tradespeople behave respect-
fully to the professionals, and obsequiously to the
aristocracy ; the professionals behave in a contemptuous
way to the tradesmen and grovel to the swells ; and
the latter are monarchs of all they survey until
Royalty happens to visit the place, when they fall
over themselves in their eagerness to crawl to the
foot of the throne. That is country life in England,
where people are taught from their childhood to order
themselves lowly and reverently to all their betters;
“ betters ” meaning, characteristically, their superiors in
rank—birth, not merit, being the English standard of
value. Contrast this existence with the freedom and
goodfellowship of the Australian bush, where a man is
valued for his own sake, and where work is considered
no degradation ; and as you Australians value your social
happiness, crush this foul reptile snobbery before it grows
any bigger.

LAND SETTLEMENT
IN
Western Australia*
Land settlement proceeds in this State with
undiminished celerity. Queensland and
Western Australia, at the present time,
stand unrivalled in the work of developing
their rural lands, but, in so far as we lie
south of the tropical State, the advantages
we have to offer are proportionately more
important. A better climate probably
accounts for the extraordinary pace at
which settlement is spreading over the
South-West of this State. Moreover, in
no State have the results been so uniformly
regular and encouraging as in Western
Australia, due, no doubt, in a large degree
to the singular reliability of the rainfall this
part of the Commonwealth can boast of.
Almost to an inch, the settler can tell
what he will receive, and even the very
months in which it will fall. The value
of such a certainty is one almost beyond
calculation. In other States, save in a
few very favored districts, the farmer
has to take his chance of a diminished
rainfall, of occasionally none at all, and
in any event of one of which it is not pos-
sible to gauge with any accuracy in advance
the seasonal distribution. These advant-
ages, coupled with the excellent prices
offered for produce, the possibilities of com-
bining mixed farming with corn growing,
and the sure spread of efficient means of
communication, are some explanation for
the attractions which the farmers of other
States seem to find in an increasing degree
in the too long neglected Western colony.
The month of December just expired has
been one of the most prosperous known in
the annals of land settlement. On certain
occasions, such as on the discovery of the
Kiiuberleys, and later on, following the
recent report of Mr. P. S. Brockman, there
may have been more activity in pastoral ap-
plications, but taking the aliei a ion sections
of the Land Act throughout, in conditional
purchases, in homestead blocks, in grazing
leases, and even in pastoral leases, the result
which Mr. Hopkins has to chronicle is
one of the most cheering and decisive yet
made public.' 'ln purely agricultural lands,
forconditional purchaseand homestead farms,
no less than 84,613 acres were applied for,
showing, as regards the former, an increase
of twenty-seven applicants and of 9762 acres
applied for, as compared with the previous
month, and as regards the latter an increase
of twenty-three applications/ and an acreage
of 2124. In addition, grazing-leases to the
extent of 21,783 have been applied for, show-
ing an increase of ten applications though a
decrease of 61 acres. A large number of
grazing leases are, it is known, taken up with
a view to adapting them to agricultural pur-
poses. If these be added to the conditional
purchases and homestead farms, we shall
have 106,396 acres taken up under the clauses
dealing with agricultural holdings. This
does not include the applications under the
Land Purchase Act, which amounted to 23
for a total of 5467 acres. These are most
remarkable figures, and seem to show that
something not unlike a boom is taking
place in agricultural land. It must be re-
membered that this is apart from the land
locked up in the Midland concession—a huge
area which must yet be brought into use to
sipply the demands of new settlers. It is
an interesting fact that the lands, most in
request are those which promise to be corn-
growing. The applications in those districts
which are supposed to be suitable for mixed
farming, and especially for dairying, are far
more scanty This may be partially due to
the fact that good vacant land is not so
abundant in those districts as elsewhere, but
it may also be ascribed in some degree to
the high rate of wages prevailing, which for-
bids such an occupation as dairying being
entered upon with any strong prospects of
profitable results. It is for these reasons
that Victoria is able to chronicle the immense
butter export which she sends annually to
this State. The total export of butter from
Victoria during last December was set down
at 6,370,1951 b., valued at £243,732. Next
to the United Kingdom, Western Australia
is the largest customer Victoria can boast
of, and, at the rate of the butter shipments
for last December, Western Australia stands
to pay Victoria in the year something over a
quarter of a million sterling alone for this one
article. Eggs may be set down at something
like a couple of thousand pounds a week.
This, however, is an import which the ex-
tension of corn-growing promises success-
fully to attack, unlike its neighbour com-
modity—butter.
The immense demand for land in Kimber-
ley, it might be thought, would have ex-
hausted the applications for pastoral leases,
but during the last month the requirements
of graziers led to 71 new applications being
sent in, totalling 1,910,743 acres. An ex-
amination of the areas under requisition
shows that applications for Kimberley land
are rapidly nearing an end, due, no doubt,
to exhaustion of the territory available. At
present the Western and the Eastern divi-
sions stand supreme, each of these having
over 600,000 acres applied for. This fact in
regard to the latter is specially gratifying.
It shows that the dryer and more un-
promising areas in the State are now being
sought out by pastoralists, and the success
many of these have attained under apparently
disadvantageous circumstances is one of the
most reassuring events in the rural settle-
ment now going on in this State. Alto-
gether the total amount of land applied for
during the month may be set down at
581 applications, for 2,017,139 acres, which
shows an increase on the preceding
month of 39 applications and of 218,231
acres. If this be continued for a very
few years, most of the possible land in
Western Australia will either pass into the
hands of private owners or be held under
lease from the Crown. The fruits of this
settlement will not be seen at once. On the
contrary, both for the pastoralist and the
agriculturist some years must elapse before
our settlers find their expectations justified.
In the meantime, it would be unfair to the
Lands Department to pass from the subject
without a word of recognition of their efforts.
Of Mr. Hopkins it may, without hesitation,
be said that he has proved himself by far the
most efficient Land Minister who has yet
given his services to the State, and the
immense increase in applications for land
must be largely due to his steadfast and per-
sistent efforts to advertise our resources. It
is, above all things, pleasing to be able to
add that from all directions come expressions
of gratitude and approval from those who
have been induced to make the change to
Western Australia from other parts of the
Commonwealth. Another period of such
efforts will leave Western Australia in a
different position as regards the relations
between producer and consumer.— Advt.

“Kyarr ” : Saw an improvement on the starting-
harrier a.lititle while since. 'Twas at a bush meeting on
the Mu tray ((Vie. side). Instead of flag, starter had a few
yards of.ret! wool. He fastened one end to starting-post,
•and getting on the outside of the course he held the
other end. Horses lined up as at barrier, and at “go ”
he snapped the wool. Only once did a horse break
through. Good starts resulted, apd riders seemed to be
with the idea. Was told it was a local device.
■Certainly it reduces expense and waste of time to a mini-
mum. In districts that are too poor to pay for the wool
-grass pan be used.
The putting on of Hirst to bowl at Cotter in the
second innings of Australia was distinctly suggestive of a
tit-for-tat spirit. The young N.S.W. man had sent some
very wicked balls at the Englishmen when they were
“batting,” or, rather, defending themselves from the
deadly missile, in their first innings. For awhile they
had positively no choice between getting out or getting
hurt, so they struck wildly at the rising ball and got out
Cotter’s appearance at the wicket was the signal for
Hirst to come along and give the fast bowler a dose of his
own medicine. The second delivery happened to send a
stump flying as though a cannon ball had struck it os
there was no more anxiety for Cotter. He was dismissed
without a bruise on his character.

Trumble’s seven wickets for 28, in the fifth test
included a hat-trick performance, his second in England-
Australia matches ; previous similar achievement was
against Maclaren’s combination in Melbourne two years
ago. At one time last week Trumble had six for 11, and
looked as if he was going to shatter records. Another
wicket for less than six runs would have wiped out
Rhodes’ and Noble’s seven for 17.

“Old-Timer”: Said that only Caffyn and
Lawrence, of the first All-England team that visited
Australia in 1861, are still above the earth. Caffyn (76
now) has a hairdresser’s shop in Surrey—he had one in
Hunter-st., Sydney, for some time. Caffyn tells that the
idea of sending an English team to these parts originated
with Messrs. Spiers and Pond, and its members each
received £l5O and exes.

“S.T.S.”: Par (8., 18/2/’O4) about the lowest
cncket-score on record, Oxford’s 12 against M. 0.0. in
1877, omits an interesting point about that downfall.
The hero of the occasion was our own genial “ Better
not" Wellington, who, going in about half-way down
the list, remained there, with the imperturbability
which has distinguished him ever since, while wickets
and empires and other small objects crashed about him.
His share of the 12 was 7 not out, a triumph under the
circumstances. He had only got into the eleven at the
last moment.

“ War E.” : A novel point in horse law cropped
up at the recent Temora (N.S.W.) races. Two horses
were nominated for a race, but one of them scratched a
little while before the event. Later the owner, changing
his mind, asked the committee to withdraw the scratch-
ing and allow him a start. This was done, and both
horses started. The scratched horse won, and the owner
of the other horse protested. The committee is now
scratching its head.

There’s room for action by the temperance
crowd against the owner of Victoria’s crack colt Emir
who doses his nag liberally with whisky before each race.
A big knock for the cold water section is the fact that
Emir has run some of his best races under that treatment.

“F.J.W.” : I know a man who bought a motor
cycle, 2£ h.p. Each morning he rides 20 miles to his
work, and on arrival takes off the bank tyre of his
cycle, hitches on a belt, anchors the machine to a stand,
and connects with a circular saw. He cuts 3in. wood all
day, and in the evening replaces his tyre and rides home.
The other evening, on his way home, he rode over a
rabbit, and bunny made a pie for the family dinner.
Where will that motor’s usefulness stop?

“ D.H.R.” : There are many ways of improving
the wearing capabilities of bikes, the knowledge of which
takes a deal of money from agents and manufacturers.
A common thing with bikists is a covering for the inside
tube made from well-tanned kangaroo skin. The other
day met two Salvarmy men with bullock-hide tyres over
the rubber ones—hairy side out. They told me that this
rendered the tyres absolutely unpuncturable, though it
made them run a bit dead. I had never struck the
bullock-hide before.

Major Taylor says that the only serious spills he
has ever had in his racing career have been while com-
peting with Ivor Lawson. The first was at Boston,
U.S.A., and the second at Melbourne, and he carries per-
manent scars as the result of each. In fact, the Major
regards racing against Lawson as the only unhealthy
branch of his business.

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to

he murdered as they flew half-dazed out of a trap 20yds.

N.S.W. National Rifle Association is making
an audacious request to the Australian Parliament for
£2OOO to send a rifle team to Bisley in July next. The
Association considers that collecting the necessary funds
by private subscriptions to despatch the team was too
much hard work, and it is going to pester the Australian
Parliament because it is a “ national matter and
the expenses should be defrayed by the Government.”
The request is a solid exhibition of cheek, and if the
making of pot-hunting rifle-shootists is a “ national
matter,” it is hard to see where nationalism will end.
At any rate, it is pleasing to note that the Association is
only on the high road to be refused ; but the refusal will,
no doubt, be classed as a political crime, and eventually
become a part of the Dry-Dog platform.

Lacrosse is likely to get a big show in Adelaide
through the quarrel of the Football Association with the
Uval authorities. There are about 400 players in the city

match with Victoria drew a 6000 gate on the Oval itself.

“E. Durst”: “ Australasian’s ” statement re
island-boy Wickham having introduced a new form of
racing, “ that of running along the bottom of the baths,”
which “ Plunge ” (8., 25/2/’O4) rather satirically comments
on, is a fact as far as the running part is concerned. The
racing portion is fiction, for the simple reason there’s no
one to compete with the brown boy. Deflating his lungs,
his body becomes dead-weight and he sinks. Without
bending 1 his legs, he stoopa until' hie hands touch the
bottom. Then he runs monkey-like, clutching the
bottom with his hands and toes, making almost s great
a speed for a distance of 15 yards as he does when in
a “ full burst ” on the surface. It is only in shallow,
firm-bottomed baths such as Bronte or Bondi that he
successfully performs this feat.

Duncan is going to retire from Maoriland football.

retirement.

t’other day, was a captain in Richmond Union club for
years, and this season “ skippered ” a very successful rink

owned the championship of Victoria in 189.1, and had
been a member of Victorian combinations opposed to
Sydney for many years past. Three hundred bowlers
attended the funeral.

And cricket do not know.
It is a game whose very name

We put our “ toppers” on the shelf,
Our soft, brown felts we don ;

At every meal we yell and feel
The joy of vict’ry great.

Charters Towers (N.Q.) figures for February.—
Stone-18,425 tons for 20,44&0z. ; cyanide-17,750 tons for
87500 Z.; assayers—l 69 tons for 1083 oz.; calls for month,
£0619 • for two months, £18,053 ; divs., month, £43,44-,
two months, £72,892. Compared with the same months
of last year, a decrease of £8969 is recorded in calls, an
an increase of £19,100 Jn divs.
. The shaft of the Central Block Co. (Charters
Towers) was sunk a distance of 336 ft. in 13 weeks ; or at
the rate of 26ft. per week. A depth of ’• 4oft - (f i r ° l j 1 ft 4 °4a S
to 544 ft.) was put down in four weeks, and 31ft. was
timbered (slabbed) in addition. The size of the shaft is
15ft by 4ft. 6in. and the formation granite. This per-
formance probably constitutes a record in shaft-sinkuig
in Australia. Four Ingersoll-Sargent drills of the D 9
type were used in sinking, and the men worked three
shifts, each shift doing 42 hours per week.

Even taking in mines, “concessions, rights,”
works, buildings, and everything else at cost price, the
New Ohillagoe (N.Q.) deficit is £66,499, not, of course,
reckoning debenture expenses, &c., as an asset, if a
reasonable amount had been written off annually for
depreciation the position would show up much wvorse--
certainlv £75,000 worse. The actual loss on the past
year’s operations, still writing off nothing for wear and
tear, was £17,370 ; the co. brings that up to£lB,.osbj
writing off a trifle from the purely paper asset of deben-
ture expenses, &c., previously mentioned. As to current
liabilities and liquid assets the position is something like
this: Liquid assets-coke, &c., and stores, £21,810,
bullion and products, £12,093; cash, £18,520 > total,
£52 423. Sundry creditors, £24,921. Surplus, £27,50-.
Certainly the co. also holds Mungana shares of a face
value of £25,000; but they may be for the present dis-
regarded. It has also sundry debtors for £11,022. In
view of this small surplus, which has probably been re-
duced by losses made since Dec. 31st, payment of the de-
benture interest on April Ist is obviously impossible. The
co.’s share capital is £696,857, and its debenture capital
£498 250. It will have to do about £45,000 better than it
did last year in order to pay its shareholders a 4 per cent,
div and £lOO,OOO better in order to do that ,in addition
to writing off 10 per cent, for depreciation of works,
plant, &c. m .
The New Ohillagoe Co. will ask Bull to make
concessions in the rate' of interest on debentures (now 5
per cent.) or to help carry on the railway to the
Etheridge. Shareholders in the new co. have stumped
up over £130,000 in calls, the bulk of which has
gone to satisfy an old bank overdraft and to
pay £30,000 a year in interest. Lady Jane and
Zilhnanton claims are the present stand-by of smelters,
but water stops big work on these mines. Rail-
way traffic was valued last year at about £60,000, but
only £25,000 worth came from the public. That is what
the debenture-holders have to look to if the mines shut
down, and £25,000 per annum, less working expenses,
will not give much interest on, roundly, £500,000. Now
is Stewart and Smith’s chance to prove that their original
report on the field was right. If debenture-holders find
they are in a corner they may listen to the Hoover and
Keats Etheridge-Chillagoe scheme, taking the view that
any stick helps a pig on. What has to be looked at is
that £lOO,OOO has been spent in Ohillagoe for develop-
ment. Chapman, Knox, and John Moffat,t are now off
the board, so the only originals left are J. S. Reid and
Harvey Patterson.

On the recommendation of manager Moss, an
additional 10 head is to be added to the Hainault (W.A.)
mill In pushing off the co.’s reserve shares a good deal
was made of the locating of the Perseverance lode by the
bore in the South Kalgurli, 90ft. south of the Hainault
boundary. As the Hainault’s deepest workings are at
650 ft., there is a long way to go to test the find at 1500 ft.
Unless the shares can be worked up to par, it is unlikely
that the Australian shareholders will take up their pro-
portion of the new issue, and it is doubtful whether the
Bull holders will meet their calls when due. Should they
fail to toe the mark, the financial position of the concern
will be far from satisfactory.

Emperor, Cue (W. A.), has been reconstructed
for the third time with an assessment of 25., which is
expected to realise £17,000. Nothing good can be said of
it. Even its London control is in hands that might be a
great deal better.
Among sensational crushings recently announced
from W.A. are the Yando, Pyke Hollow, in the Yerilla
district, of 32 tons for 7750 z. ; and the Sydney Mint,
Kunanalling, of 52 tons for 9520 z. The latter show has
had previous rich returns, but the former is new.
• * * *
Golden Ridge, Boorara (W* A.), has started an
extra 10-head of stamps, 4nd will in future treat nearly
1500 tons monthly. The co. is one of the few local
concerns which has stayed its hand in paying divs. till it
was fully equipped. It now owns a 20-head mill with
rock-breaker and concentrators all paid for, and is in a
position to work very cheaply. The first div. of 3d. per
share, or £390, was recently declared, and it will be
followed monthly. The directors intend to build up a
reserve fund instead of distributing profits right up to
the hilt, until the co. is in a strong financial position.
The co. is in 31,200 shares, quoted at £2 15s. to £3.

In December last the following official report
was published in the papers by the Ivanhoe Junction :
“ Ore, 12in. wide, assaying 290 z. to the ton over a length
of fully 20ft.” In February it was reported2soft.
level : Lode opened for 105 ft., very regular in character
and shows free gold all through ; Ift. of ore in south
fac.' value 30dwt. per ton ; north face, 3ft. of ore, value I
15dwt... 150 ft. level : Driven 50ft. ; average value for 2ft.
wide, 2oz. per ton.” In the face of this, the test crush-
ing comes out 3dwt. per ton, and, as the shares fell from
6s. to less than 3s. before its announcement to the public,
it looks very much as though somebody got hold of the
information before the public had it, and sold out. If
this is so, it is scandalous. On the face of it, it looks
scandalous ; and until a satisfactory explanation is forth- j
coming, the only safe thing for the public to do is to
leave the Ivanhoe Junction severely alone.
* * * *
South K ilgurli (W.A.) during February treated
10,048 tons ot t tilings for 28390 z. This pans out at over ]
sdwt. per ton, but, as the gold is worth only 50s. an oz.,
the average is really 3|dwt. Sinking the main shaft is
still proceeding, but it will be some time before sufficient
reserves are blocked out to justify the re-starting of the
treatment-plant. If developments should confirm the
diamond drill bore, which cut the Perseverance lode at a
depth of 1500 ft., worth 4oz. per ton for a width of 14ft.,
the mine has still a future before it. It may be pointed
out that this Perseverance lode has not been worked in
the sulphide, as late manager Isles said it was no good
below the oxidised zone. The reef is, therefore, untouched
below the 300 ft. level, and may add a lot of ore to the
mine’s reserves if the diamond drill has spoken the
truth.
At Poverty Point.
P. R. Dix, the one-time king of the vaudeville business
in Maoriland, is not so conspicuous in the monarch
line as he was. At one time he spread all over the
State, but latterly he only operated in Wellington, and
now the Council has closed up his theatre (the Royal),
pending certain structural alterations. In his palmy
days Dix was fat, pleasant and easy-going, and was badly
imposed upon. He is still fat, but it is the fatness of one
who has lost faith in many things. Meanwhile, John
Fuller and his sons have been steadily drawing in the
small silver coin, which they have, with great pers-
picacity, invested in the freeholds of the halls they
originally leased.
This year’s Conservatorium scholarship for music at
Adelaide University goes to a Broken Hill miner’s
cottage. The winner is a small boy named. Tonkin, a
violinist of remarkable promise, who was “ discovered,
even among Broken Hill people, only a few months ago.
Sylvia Grey, the dainty Gaiety burlesque dancer of
yore, tells a story of a young barrister who bought her
photo at a London shop for eighteenpence, and wrote
across the bottom of it, in a bold, feminine hand,
“Always affectionately yours, Sylvia. He stuck the
inscribed portrait on the mantelpiece at his chambers,
and was happy in the envy of the other Johnnies until it
chanced that'his sister, who had seen the Picture, was
introduced to Sylvia Gr6y. The brothers precious
souvenir didn’t long survive this meeting between the
girls. “Affectionately Yours” called round to the
impostor's chambers and put his treasured purchase on
the Are.
Fred B. Norton, advertisement agent and general
humorist, is on the sick-list again, and his Melbourne
friends are organising a benefit for the versatile citizen.
An entertainment worthy of the occasion will be given at
the Athenaeum Hall on the 13th (a Wednesday) of next
month. A smart show being assured, the promoters are
now engaged in securing the services of a “ large and ap-
preciative audience.** Several hundred tickets are already
floated, and active steps are being taken to supply the
necessities of deserving purchasers. The irrepressible
Norton has been forbidden to joke for the next three
months, but he disobeys the doctor’s order on the slightest
excuse. When told that applications for tickets were
rolling in, he shook his head warningly aud said, “ Pray
insist upon having the highest references in every case.
Don’t forget that this is to be a Testimonial Benefit Per-
formance.”
“ R.0.X.” : Permit me to snort at a Poverty Point
contributor who recently anticipated Hugh J. Ward’s
appearance at Drury Lane with the comment that that
comedian, with his “ weak voice,” would be lost on the
stage of London’s most expansive theatre. Recent
notices to hand are unanimous in recognising his per-
formance as artistic and a distinct gain to a cast com-
prising Dan Leno and a number of other leading actors.
Though Australian theatre-goers usually saw the man in
subordinate parts, the paucity of material on which he
worked would have surprised many who watched him
from “in front.” When the “Emerald Isle” was in
rehearsal Ward received two slips, comprising about a
dozen sentences, as his part in the opera. From this
flimsy material he built up the quaint Hogarth-like
character, which was an undoubted feature of the Mel-
bourne production. Courtneidge (the brain behind the
scenes during the recent Shakspearean season) saw the
result, and was so enthusiastic that he advised Ward to
<>•o to London. As to Ward’s “ weak voice ’’—the lamented
Girard, of pleasant Bronson memory, had a much weaker
voice, but he nevertheless “ sang” his way into favor.
News comes from London, that recent
wool-sales had to be postponed on account ot the
fog. The air was so thick that it was impossible
to tell which was wool and which was gloom, , and
after ten bales of fog had been sold at auction, and
the buyers had breathed in most of the wool by
mistake, they gave it up.
Adelaide, generally supposed to be a quiet
and retiring city of the elderly unmarried aunt
description, gave preacher Dowie the most violent
reception he has yet met with in Australia.
Sharebrokers are said to have been conspicuous in
the shindy. One of them dropped bottles of
sulphuretted hydrogen on the floor and .created a
searching perfume. Also songs were sung, and
the surplus crowd outside had free fights with the
police, and windows were broken, and in a
general way the “Prophet” was routed with
great loss.
The Llamas of Thibet—so a probably un-
reliable cable states-hope to lmep back the
British exDedition under Colonel Younghus

There is a beautiful cuss-site just south of tlie

level, and one can stand on the verandah and
swear at 90 miles of. gorge and precipice.

“ H.S.R.” on the Chinese : —
i?« query b y"Nymsie"(B. 25/2/’04) as to importation
of Chinamen. Dr. Dang, in his “ Freedom and Inde-
pendence," mentions the importation of 1000 Chinese into
Moreton Bay alone, besides those imported into other
pxrts of Australia, and he says that “ that district has
actually contributed not less than £13,000 for the impor-
tation of foreigners through the heinous policy of the
Colonial Office.” The book referred to was published in
1852. _ I have heard old men in Queensland talking of
breaking in mobs of Chinamen as if they were horses, and
oni Ellangowan (Darling Downs) there was an out station,
called the Old Chinee Camp, which I was told was used
for this purpose. It is safe to say that the Chow was
here in 1845. i ,.
Heaton’s “ Dictionary of Dates ” has it that the
first importation of Chinamen was in N.S.W. in
1848, when some obnoxious capitalists brought in
a shipload ; also that the first importation to
Brisbane was in 1850. In 1875, 2000 Chinese were
landed at Cooktown.
T. P.'s Weekly gives some specimens of
mixed metaphor. A Bow (London) vestryman
described the local baths as a “ millstone hanging
round the necks of the ratepayers like a white
elephant.” A member of a school board in Mid-
lothian taunted a fellow-member with having
“ pressed forcibly home a shadowy accusation
which was but the reflection of an invisible bug-
bear.” The late Lord Kenyon once warned his
hearers that “if an individual can break down
any of those safeguards which the constitution has
so wisely and so cautiously erected by poisoning
the minds of the jury at a time when they are
called upon to decide, he will stab the administra-
tion of justice in its most vital part.” An eminent
American orator once delivered himself as follows:
“The muddy slough of politics is the rock upon
which our party has split in twain, and fallen in
pieces from the pinnacle of imperishable fame.
Let us then gird up our loins, so that we may go
forth with a clear head.”

“ Deeby ” : One of the dreariest of the
dreary N.S.W. western towns is Wellington. It
is also one of the oldest and most dilapidated. It
is fast becoming a Chinese town. The local far-
mers and residents support the local Chinese
stores almost exclusively. Of course, half-caste

After you have vegetated a while in Wellington
you will discover that a Chinaman is never con-
victed at the local police-court nowadays. Once
in the remote backblocks of history, a Mongol
was found guilty of stealing a large quantity of
onions and was severely punished by being fined
a small sum. But that was the exception, and
besides, it was an offence against property.
Babies seem to be coming in again to some
extent m Maordand. Down to 1880 that State
had the highest rate in Australasia : by 1887 it
had absolutely t lie lowest. Bottom seems to have
been reached m 1900, when the baby rate per 1000
of the population was 25‘60 ; but from that point
there has been a steady recovery, until last vear
it got to 26-61—an improvement of one small

Burglar Bill ” : Be fasting performances.
Knew a prisoner who fasted for seven days be-
cause his petition was refused. The food trucks
were placed inside the door of the wing and each
prisoner was handed his share as he marched by.
I marched behind this man and he, refused his
dish morning, noon and evening for seven days.
He had only a pot of water and a
bottle of medicine in his cell, so it
was a genuine performance. The warder m
charge of the cookhouse, who stood alongside the
trucks, never said anything. He had only one
facial expression—a chronic stomach-ache look—
so that I couldn’t tell if lie had noticed the faster.
None of the other prisoners knew. On the morn-
ing of the eighth day the hominy tin was handed
to him. His hand went out, came back, then flew
out again and closed on it. After breakfast I
looked at the tin as he brought it downstairs. It
was shiny inside ; he had wiped it out with a piece
of bread. The man who beats his stomach will
sit undisturbed in Hades.

CHRONIC CONSTIPATION REMOVED.
A STARTLING FACT.
Nothing in organic derangement produces more sickness than
constipation, it is insidious in its development and progress.
It is the hot-bed of all infectious and contagious diseases.
The bowels are the main-sewer for carrying off the waste
matter and foetid products of the body.
The longer the residuum is allowed to remain, the more
immovable it becomes, with consequent risk to health.
The immediate results are indicated in sick-headache, bilious-
ness, coated tongue, foul breath, sour stomach, skin erup-
tions such as pimples, boils, eczema, etc.
The pimples, blotches, and disfigurements are but the outward
manifestations of the poisons within.
The gentlest natural corrective to constipation is a famous
preparation medically commended — Kutnow’s Powder.
Kutnow’s Powder is a scientific production in which are
incorporated the health-giving virtues from the most
famous European medicinal springs.
Taken in the early morning before breakfast, Kutnow’s Pow-
der acts gently but efficiently, flushing out the alimentary
duct, and forming a delightfully refreshing and palatable
draught.
THE GREAT SACRIFICE.
Hundreds of people sacrifice tlieir health on the altar of
procrastination.
Warnings innumerable occur, but a strange indifference holds
sway, with sooner or later terrible consequences.
The neglect of precautionary measures in correcting constipa-
tion involves the gravest risk to those with sedentary
occupations.
The use of drugs, pills, and drastic powerful purgatives is
most dangerous, and only accentuates the difficulty.
After the purgative, the constipation becomes more and more
pronounced, and weakens the natural peristalsis.
Kutnow s Powder, on the contrary, simply flushes the bowels,
disinfects the duct, and invigorates the natural action.
Are you a victim to this terrible scourge to health ?
Do you find occasional difficulty in regulating the bowels ?
If so, take Kutnow’s Powder and that difficulty will be
removed.
KUTNOW’S POWDER can be obtained in capsuled
Bottles from all Chemists and Medicine Vendors.
IRRESISTIBLE TESTIMONY.
A TRAINED NURSE writes:
, . . “ 59, West Derby-street, Edge Hill, Liverpool.
Dear Sirs, —Having given your Kutnow’s Powder a fair trial, I feel it my duty to let you
know the results. I have given it in two special cases of chronic constipation, with the result
that one patient is now quite well; the other only needs an occasional dose. Both are cases of
several years’ standing. As a nurse of great experience, I think your Powder is excellent.—
Yours truly, “NURSE F. PHILLIPS.”
SIGNOR FOLDESY writes:
“ 11, Bloomsbury Square, London, W.C., 10th Dec., 1903.
. , V ,e benefit I have derived from Kutnow’s Powder compels me to state that those afflicted
with Liver trouble or Constipation may rely absolutely on your preparation for permanent
relief and perfect health. It is a delightful remedy, and seems to impart new life into the
system. Yours truly, « ARNOLD FOLDESY.”
A Note of Warning.
The above facts and the weighty testimony apply to Kutnow’s Powder and to Kutnow’s
Powder only. No other preparation contains the same virtues as Kutnow’s Powder. A word
of warning is therefore perhaps necessary when you wish to buy the genuine article and to
derive the same satisfaction as those who have already used it. Kutnow’s Powder can be
obtained at all Chemists and Medicine Vendors. See that the fac-simile signature, “S. Kutnow
and Co., Ld.,” and the registered trade mark, “ Hirschensprung, or Deer Leap,” are on the
outer carton or case in which the bottle is packed, and also on the label on the bottle. The
signature and trade mark will alone insure your obtaining the
GENUINE KUTNOW’S POWDER.

my ease to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage

Mr. W. G. Hearne, Geelong.—
Dear Sir, —
Your letter and Bronchitia Cure to hand quite safe.
I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronohitis Cure three times a day a* directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am,
dear Sir,
“ Your* very truly,

HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL.
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HEARNE S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extraot runs as follows: —" As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearties
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me tins
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
ood liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
I very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
I never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
l very much. The doctor told her husband that there v> as
I nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it ,
j but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
I the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

The Coasting Trade.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Mid strident shout and ming’Od din,
And curses loud and bold,
Hot winches swing their burdens in
Above a flare-lit hold.
Sharp dog-hooks grip, the slings haul t; J.t,
Close-looped around a prize
Of heavy crates, or booty light
Of varied merchandise.
Along the gangway lightly trips
A maiden’s dainty shoe;
An ankle trim most coyly slips
By accident, in view.
Along the gangway also falls
The lumper’s vulgar boot,
As either Love or Duty calls
The Beauty or the Brute.
With glug and gasp a harbor tide,
Polluted and unclean,
Sucks oilily the coaster’s side,
And creeps the piles between.
Impatient at its vile caress,
In bondage fretting, she
Strains tight her shore lines in distress
To meet a cleaner sea.
“ Let go your for’ard spring, my lads;
’Vast heaving aft,” he cries—
The skipper’s at his post, my lads,
Good wishes and good-byes
Ring out across the widening stream
And faintly die away,
As with the .ferry lights abeam
She ploughs the starlit bay.
1' Ist keeled, and light of draught to cross
The doubtful depths afar
Of all-uncertain seas that toss
About a Northern bar ;
Broad-hulled and fitted for the trade
The river trade, that pays—
In straight routine her life is laid
On coastal waterways.
She lifts to meet thp coming surge,
A knife of commerce keen,
An iron slave to hold or urge
A dividend machine.
And as the South Head light sweeps out,
White-banded o’er the main,
As willing as a wife, she leaps
To take her work again.
She heaves her glossy flanks adrip
With darkly spouting brine—
A serving maid, a cargo ship, - - - - ~
i 'Test contract-built on Tyne,
Soft purring, like a petted cat,
In great content of soul,
Has found her pleasant habitat
Along the open roll.
Newcastle lights will dimly show
Before the dawning gray,
And as the sunlit billows go,
Soft-armed to clasp the Day,
Seal Rocks their heads will grimly lift,
A-watching for strayed hulls,
vhere to and fro, unresting, drift
The circling, screaming gulls.

And sparing of discourse.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Mb. Carter, that Chinaman in Brogan’s Lane
wants to see you at once.”
“Brogan’s Lane, dear sister, is full of China-
men. Unregenerate, the most of them, I fear,
and on whom the good seed has fallen but to
perish. And it is very oppressive outside.”
“ But the man lie sent was most insistent; said
that it was very important that he should see you.
He is very ill.” |
“Ah, well!—truly has it been said that there
shall be no rest for those of His anointed whose
mission it is to preach His saving gospel. Did
this wretched Chinaman send any name ? ” in*
quired the Rev. Carter.
“No ; I thought you would know him. He is
that horrible, fat old man who gave sister Hannah
the jade bracelet. ”
“Humph ! ( Li Goon. Well, I must go, I
presume.”
Kicking off his slippers—one pf the numerous
pairs embroidered for him by adoring feminine
parishioners—and taking up his hat. and a faded
green umbrella, the missionary set out for Brogan’s
Lane.
*** * .
It was the usual lower-class Chinese quarter,
squalid and reeking of stenches Asiatic in
intensity—a quarter in which most of the hovels
surrounding his own were the property of the
insistent Li Goon. - i
The latter, when found by the clergyman, was
lying on a wretched bunk made up of old bags,
nailed to a stretcher. The dirty yellow tint of his
face was horribly accentuated by sickness, as lie-
lay caught in the grip of spasms of coughibg that
threatened to shake his crazy cOuch to pieces.
“Well, Li; what is the matter? Yiou are,
indeed, looking ill, my friend. If I could but
persuade you to listen to the Message. Do not, I
beseech you, perish in that darkness that com-
passes those who die not in the Lord.” ’
“All li, Misser Carter. Ino come along your
joss same way common coolee. Him alia time lice-
Clistian. Now me die . .. me savee want do 1
good alia same missionally man. You savee my
lillee white gal, Nellie, eh? Now me come die,
me think me make her my lillee stay-at-home,
who you call ’im, wife, eh. You inally us, Misser
Carter?”
.“What! marry you to that wretched creature
with whom you have lived in vice and wretched-
ness?. Well, yes,” he added, after a moment’s
reflection; “on condition that i*—if, as I
imagine ”
All li, you fetch Nellie ’long; she welly good
gal. Catch her nex’ door ; she talkee Black Bill.”
* * * *
_ Dutside, an animated discussion was being con-
ducted between the fair, if somewhat frail, Nellie
and the aforementioned Black Bill. He was
piessing the girl to adopt a course of action to 11
wmch she offered hesitatingly a half-frightened,
opposition.
“ But Bill, I don’t trust Li. He’s deep, is Li r
you blokes what only sees ’im when yous is markiru’
tickets don’t know ’im like me that’s lived with,
im. He scares ir,e, I can tell yer.”
“ Garn ! No bloomin’ Chow ain’t goin’ to choke
me off a good thing. He’s chuckin’ in ’is alley -
any mug can see that'; an’ if ther old fool wants
ter splice yer, well, the better fer us. S’posin’ r e>
gets ther strength of that splosh we took from ’is
box. If yer ’is missis, it’s all sigarno. If yer
am t, well—it’s a stretch fer the pair o’ us when
we re copped.”
“ But, Bill, yer ” |
~ “ ’Struth ! Yer give me ther pip. It’s just this.
Awkin s a gime what ain’t fer me, with them
Johns chasin’ yer round like a dorg. I’ll chuck it

• u * o° u on » °^ e S’*!- It’ll pan out orli
rl Jmt. Say—chuck us a couple of deeners. I’m
off to the school; so long ! ”
The Rev. Carter, proud of his new convert-
thought the occasion a fitting one on whioh ta
deliver a homily to the prospective Mrs. Li The
proceeding was cut short by that wholly unre-
pentant damsel, who made her way to the room,
in winch the marriage was to take place. Arrived
there, the ceremony was at once proceeded with.
At its conclusion the Rev. Carter, with the
business instinct of his profession predominant
deemed the moment a fitting one in which to pro-
pound a pet scheme by which he hoped to wring
from his apparently moribund convert a generous
portion of his worldly possessions, to be devoted
to mission purposes.
After asking the newly-made bride to leave the
room, a request to which she gave a flat refusal, he
returned to Li.
“ My friend, you are now within sight of your
eternal rest and to you may come the call at any
moment. Let me entreat you then to help cany-
on the good work of drawing your benighted
tellow-countrymen from the darkness in which
they are struggling. I will bring to you within
the hour a lawyer, who will draw your will up for
you. Surely, Li, you will devote a portion of
your means to the , r
Here his appeal was brought to an abrupt con-
ifer 11 by an outburst from the indignant Nellie -

“ If evidence is wanting of the existence
of a remedy that will cure the splitting
headaches that women are sometimes
troubled with, I am the person who can
give that evidence,” says Mrs. A. Moon, of
164 Regent-street, • Redfern, Sydney. 1
have had most wretched times with my
head, being quite knocked up and unfitted
for work, having sometimes to lie down all
day. I was also troubled with Constipation,
which I expect was the main cause of my
headaches and the untold misery that fol-
lowed. I had heard of your Bile Beans, but
had little faith in medicines, so many had
failed to afford me relief, but, in the end,
was persuaded to give them a trial, i hew
beneficial effect was marvellous, and a short
course proved sufficient to restore me to
health. That was some few years ago, but
1 I still use Bile Beans as our family medi-
cine. and find them satisfactory in every
respect, differing from many medicines 1
have tried, in that they do not leave be-
hind them that nausea or griping feeling,
and I can always depend on them to tone
up the liver, and restore energy to the
whole system.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We’ve laid our course south-east by east,
Around old Pencar- ROW,
Where the surf hoi’s up like the frothing yeast,
And the ocean breezes blow.
East away and south by east.
But—none of us wants to go.
The skipper’s in love with a half-caste girl
(Oh ! her lips are full and red !)
“ It's lonely out where the currents swirl ;
I’d rather stay here,” he said.
We re singin’, “ We’re off to the Rio Grande*
And the capstan’s movin’ gay ;
But we’d sooner be bearin’ the German band
In Oriental Bay,
Where the women walk in their dainty gear,
And the moon comes risin’ slow—
Ah ! yes, we know what course to steer,
But—none of us wants to go.^
The mate is gone on a black-eyed Dream
(She gave him her waist to squeeze),
And he’d rather lie out in the gleam
Of the stars than face the seas.
We’re givin’ the home-bound songs a fl ng
To the roll of the lazy swell ;
’Twill Vie many a night ere we hear the ring
Of the Kelburne tram-car bell,
As it takes its load to the moonlit hills
Where there ain’t no lamps to show —
The fores’l shakes and the stays’l fills,
But—none of us wants to go.
The second mate and the cook are down
Below, for they’ve got d.t.’s,
Arid the height of ambition with them’s to drown
Themselves in the cool, green seas.
We’re leanin’ our arms on the weather rail
As the nor’-east drives her through,
Watchin’ the in-bound Sydney mail
And wishin’ we’re in-bound too.
They sang a hymn as we got the breeze,
And the parson said, “ I know
You’ll act like men on the angry seas.”
But— he didn’t have to go.
Oh ! the skipper he clung to his half-caste queen
(My oath !. what a queen she were),
And I thought of what is and what might have
been
Last night on the mountain spur,
Where the cable cars came past a-whirl
With their lamps a-blazin’ bright;
But it came to be “ last down car ’’—poor girl!
And it came to be “Just —good night.”
She was neat and trim in her pretty gear,
And her eyes were wistful. Oh !
We know what glitterin’ course to steer,
But—none of us wants to go.
For the mate is gone on a lovely Dream,
But we reckon he’ll wake up soon ;
And the second mate and the cook, they seem
To be off in a ten-year swoon ;
And each of us, caged for a four-months spell,
Will think, at least for a while,
Of a rattlin’ coup in a Chinkie hell,
Or else of a woman’s smile.
“For Those in Peril at Sea ” they sang,
As we swung her away so slow';
But it isn’t the peril that brings the pang ;
It’s—because we d<sn’t want to go.
But the course is east by south and east,
And we've passed old Pencar- now ;
The water boils at her boivs like yeast,
And the skipper he's broodin' so ;
But what we toould like don't matter the least
Because —we have got to go.

“The Gate of Cursing.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I drew nearer to look. Yes !— it was a human
skull, weather-worn and bleached, and spiked to
the ancient wall. The shadow of a palm-leaf
came and went across its gleaming whiteness, and
the brilliant scarlet bell of a campanula, drooping
rakishly over one caverned orbit, marred with a
grotesque abandon the sightless sternness of the
thing’s regard. Beneath it was a lintel-stone,
topping the green-stained pillars of a built-up
gateway. But the masonry between them looked
as old as they ; the secret of this sealed-up, skull-
surmounted portal was certainly no recent one.
I climbed the lusty creepers, tore away a hand-
ful of tendrils from the lintel, artdfound a Dutch
inscription—of which all I could make out was
that it concerned one Pieter Elbeffeld and finished
with “Den 22nd April, 1722.” Stay ; here comes
a Javanese-a gentleman, by his gold-embroidered
" bajuandthe gems on his kns handle. Perhaps
he will know. •. , . .u in
I scrambled down, and pointed to the skull,
“Pieter Elberfeld,” I asked; “does the great
lord know who he was—or why this skull hangs
thus upon the wall ? ” . . ,
The “great lord” took his cigar from his jet-
black teeth, glared at me with his rat-like eyes,
' spat fiercely on the ground, and walked on with-
out a word!
*.• * * *
After dinner, when the cigar-fumes were as the
smoke of a city, I mentioned the matter to my
hosts at the club. “But, perhaps he didnt
understand Malay!” I concluded. Though I
have alwavs supposed that the difference between
it and the" Javanese spoken here”-
“Isn’t very great,’ De Beer put in. Neither
is it. And I fancy he understood you only too
well. How do you say he looked?” ....
“As if he would have had no violent objection
t °SSwM»® jolly Dutch laughter—from
all but a little, crab-apple man with a long
“imperial,” as white as his linen jacket. „
“ Monsieur VAnglais is typical of his nation,
l.e said in French. “He attaches no importance
, lu„ historv of any people but his own. Other-
he wo,Sd »ot "w See cl to ta told why .h ;s
Native gentleman resented an insulting inquiry n
Fat appears to have been a very proper manner
There was a chorus of protest before the burly
De Beer could get a chance to say—“ Van Dupper,
you are illogical. If our guest here is ignorant or
the historical episode in question, how could tie
have intended any violence to the yellow-skin s
feelings? Also, Van Dupper, you are rude.
and the company calls upon to make you
apologies to the Heer Englander ! ’
But the Heer Englander wasnt going to set
this one drop of vinegar against a flood of genial
Dutch politeness to the stranger- • , ~
“There is no apology needed, ’ I said. Ana,
if I am so much to be pitied for having never
heard of Pieter Elberfeld, perhaps the excellent
Heer Van Dupper will enlighten me !
The mollified little greybeard came over and
shook my hand. “I will, Mynheer—l will!
And there’s nobody in a better position to do it.
Don’t let any of these fellows spoil the story tor
you, but present, to-morrow, in the proper
.quarter, a letter which I Will give you. It will
procure you access to the official records, and
you’ll find the story well worth re-casting .
And—whether it was or not—here it is.
* *• * ' *
It is a curious physiological fact that, although
the reverfcive tendency of the half-caste is gener-
ally towards the inferior race, a still further
infusion of that race’s blood will often cause
reversion towards the superior.
In Meeda Elberfeld—a three-parts Javanese—
were strangely reproduced the complexions,
mental and bodily, of her European grandfather ;
whereas, if Pieter Elberfeld, her father—with but
half the yellow blood —had not been heart and
soul Javanese enough to plan the extermination
of the Dutch, the present writer would not, in
the Jaoatra suburb of Batavia, have smelt a story
in a walled-up gate. y
But just within this gate/one night many a
year ago, Meeda Elberfeld was consenting to a
private marriage, because to her soldier-lover her
half-caste father had averred that, sooner than
unite her to a Dutchman, he would cut her throat
with his own hand. ; , . ,
“Which is the more strange,” whispered
Sybrandt Overbeck, “ in that your father is him-
self more Dutch than you are.”
“He hates the very word ! the girl said.
“And, sometimes, I even think”—she stopped
and shuddered.
“What, Meeda?”
“Nothing ; at least, nothing yet. Away now,
Gybrandt, for it is late, and he may look into my
room.” , ~
An hour later, when the darkness of impending
thunder had shut out the midnight stars, Elberfeld
did look into his daughter’s room. The girl lay—
to appearance —fast asleep, and for half-a-minute,
lamp in hand, he watched her. I hen his fierce
face darkened more as his eye, travelling from the
girl’s almost white arm, fell upon the dusky hand
that held the light. > , ■
“ Who would think that I am the nearer of the
two to this accursed race of tyrants?” he mut-
tered. “But, glory be to Allah! their hour
approaches! ” ‘
Meeda, catching these last words, arose and
followed her father, as he put out his lamp and
stole away in the darkness. The faint sound of
his slippers guided her to where, beside an open
door, he stood and exchanged a whispered word,
with one person after another, entering cautiously •
in the darkness, to the number, as she judged, of
half-a-hundred. Then, when in an inner room-
they talked together in low tones, she listened to-
such purpose that her ears, there is little question,
saved the Hollanders in Batavia from extermina-
tion complete and utter. But her depositions,
covering. 50 foolscap pages, must here go into 20
lines. ,
Except her father, every man present, Meeda
gathered, was a native prince of influence, and
upon kris and Koran every man swore solemnly
to carry out his part of an undertaking in which
Elberfeld had collaborated with the two brothers,
of the Sultan of Matarram. Which was this.;
The Sultan was to be slain, and the ferocious pair
of brothers were to reign in his stead, on condition
that they first assisted Elberfeld, with 30,000
men, to fall upon Batavia in- the night and
slaughter without mercy every full-blooded Dutch
man, woman and child in the Residency.
“And then,’ said Elberfeld exultingly, “our.
example will be quickly followed wherever else in
Java these accursed white vermin have made a
nest. And every man who has within him a drop
of native blood will have reason, then, to bless
God for what he has ignorantly considered a taint
and a disgrace.” .
The oaths were sworn again ; the fatal date was
named; a final meeting was fixed for the night
before —and back fled Meeda to her room, horri-
fied and trembling—for was not her Sybrandt
“ full-blooded ” ? And Sybrandt Overbeck, when
the information reached him, took it straight to
his colonel.
• * * •
It was the last night. Two in the morning
would soon come; the conspirators were less
cautious on the eve of fruition, and there was
light enough in Elberfeld’s house to show that
amongst the fierce-eyed little chieftains were half-
a-dozen women, armed with the inevitable kris,
and thirsting for the slaughter.
. One of these it was whose ear first caught a
faint sound as of shuffling feet in the garden.
-Elberfeld darted out—then back, with his kris
drawn and his eyes distended.
“Out with the lights !” he hissed, “and make
for the other door !”
But the other door was guarded, too, and when,
at a hoarse command, a score of damar-torches
flared up, they shone upon the long bayonets of a
line of soldiers that completely encircled the
house. And—so short and sharp is the Dutch
soldier in Asia—when the chiefs were ordered
to throw down their krisses, they knew it was
either that or instant slaughter. Sulkily they
heaped their snaky weapons on the floor, and there
would have been no killing—then—had not one of
the women, with a mad screech of desperation,
darted fiercely upon a grey-headed sergeant who
stood in advance of his men. But that experi-
enced warrior—coolly catching her kris-thrust
upon the shoulder of his bayonet—kicked her legs
from under her, and smashed her skull, as she lay,
with the heel-plate of his heavy firelock. Which—
as the other five women were afterwards smothered
with pillows —was, perhaps, just as well for her.
Of the male conspirators, four lost their heads,
and all the rest their right hands—save Elberfeld.
For him was reserved that more unusual penalty
for which the recording official appears to have
invented the curious term “ equination ’ —the
wrenching of limbs from body, to wit, by four
strong horses, driven in different directions. The
ghastly particulars of which transaction—minutely
set forth in the record —may very well be left
there. And to this day his scheming cranium—
however little it may adorn my tale—points well
the moral of the words :
“Behold here the skull of that memorable
miscreant, Pieter Elberfeld, whose herewithin
house has been levelled and this gate walled-up,
so that in this, his accursed den of treason, no
man may raise a stone or plant a tree any more
for ever.”

Covered with Boils
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla Cures Severe Case of Impure Blood. Also Im-
proves the Sight. A Blood-Builder.
W'
v.
Mr. James Jonnson, engineer, oi
South Forbes, New South Wales,
sends us his photograph, and says:
“My whole body being covered
with boils, I was induced to try Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla (through an advertise-
ment in the local paper), and after
taking one bottle I am entirely free
from any eruption whatever. I also
found it beneficial to the eyesight,
being a strengthener not only of the
blood, but of the sight. I can and will
confidently recommend this valuable
blood-purifier to all suffering from
similar complaints as myself.”
This is a splendid testimonial, and
we trust it may prove of great benefit
to you, giving you renewed confidence
in this grand family medicine.
“Ayer’s Sarsaparilla makes the blood pure.” This is a very short sen-
tence ; yet it may mean everything to you, even life itself. “Everything
depends upon the blood.” This is another short sentence, and yet how
true it is. When the blood is pure and rich, then the nerves are strong
and steady, the brain is clear and active, and the skin is free from rashes
and eruptions. If you are not in the best of health, get this grand medicine
at once. You will feel its tonic, strengthening effects before a couple of
days have passed.
Be sure you get “Ayer’s” Sarsaparilla. The old reliable Sarsaparilla. .
Do not run any risk. Look out for imitations. •

“Nym” : Put in an afternoon at Melbourne Aquarium,
t’other Saturday, admiring the finny comedians, trage-
dians, and clowns in the tanks, and paying- my disre-
spects to my old friends the pelicans, monkeys, and
turtles. The fish are all mixed up like pickles, promis-
euous-like, but their movements amused me. What
fussy little objects the toad-fish are, likewise the gaudy
little cowfish and 'cobblers. But there is a pathetic
side to it all—the one-eyed schnapper. He is a little
fellow whose happiness has been blighted in infancy.
One side, of his face is bright and cheery, and full of ex-
pression ; then he turns round, arid the other side is a
blank walhof fish—an unseeing area of meat—a sightless
calamity and a desert. I feel so sorry for the one-eyed
little schnapper that I will never go to the Aquarium
again. He made me weep into his tank.
“T.D.” : Mentioned by Poster Fraser, in his round-the-
world book, that, at Moscow, he heard grand opera in
four different languages, each principal singing his
mother tongue. But Melbourne can beat that record.
At the old Princess’, “ Fra Diavolo,” I believe, was once
put on in five languages—English. Italian, French,
German, and Spanish. Mrs. Palmer, then Rosina Caran-
dini, was in the cosmopolitan cast. The bulk of the
audience imagined they had been listening to Italian
opera. Not till next day did they learn that they had
really been feasted in five tongues.
“ T.D.” : Many people who watch the posturings and
extraordinary gyrations of Mrs Sims Beeves on the
Rickards stage imagine that she is giving a faithful
representation of her dead husband’s manner. Reeves,
however, did not act his songs, except facially. He used
to place himself solidly on the centre of the platform,
bend forward a trifle, and keep that way right through
his song. Nobody understood better than Reeves the
necessity for keeping still if a really good vocal tone was
to be produced. Even on the opera stage he seldom
shifted about very much when singing. Opera-goers
nowadays would call him a “stick,” but the singers of
the old days thought more of the preservation of their
voices than they did about dramatic forcefulness.
M!ss Bertha. Faning writes from London : “ Still under
euccessful voice-culture with Mine. Guy D’Hardelot at
Sarah Siddons’ house in Upper Baker-street. This
historical building- is about to be demolished to make
room for railway premises. A plaque in front inscribed :
‘ Mrs. Siddons, actress, lived here. Born, 1755; died,
1831,’ was placed there in the seventies to mark a famous
spot in theatrical annals. The house is still in sound
condition, and contains several memorials of the great
tragedienne, including a small painted glass window
designed and erected by herself, and showing medallion
portraits of Shakspeare, Milton, Cowley, Spenser and
Dryden. Mrs. Siddons bequeathed her ‘ leasehold house
in Upper Baker-street' to her daughter Cecilia, with her
* carriages, horses, plate, pictures, books, wine and furni-
ture, and all the money in the house and at the banker’s.'
Cecilia and her brother George also received by their
mother’s will the inkstand made from Shakspeare's
mulberry tree at Stratford and the bard’s gloves, which
Mrs. Garrick presented to Mrs. Siddons. And now my
Australian voice is ringing through these ancient rooms
aromatic of art, and my upper tones know no fear.”
“ F.E.P.” : Surely Maoriland is the great show country
on earth, taking into consideration its limited popula-
tion. At present travelling here : Ten dramatic com-
panies (some of them big concerns), two circuses (Fitz-
geralds’ and Wirth’s), eight vaudeville shows, two
lecturers, four concert companies, and at least a score of
cin., kin.., bi. and other “graph” shows. Also, the land
is literally creeping with amateur companies.
Joe Chamberlain is the idol of the London ’alls just
now. At one of the suburban palaces of variety, so-
called, an elderly actress has been reciting a “ poem ” to
the glory of Protection. Not Preferential Trade with
the beastly kawlinies, don’t you know—but Protection.
“ JiA.C.” : Surely George Coppin must be the father,
not only pf the Australian stage, but of all stages.
Eighty-five years of age, and 81 of them passed in
theatrical business ! He was only four when he made his
first appearance with his father's company. At seven he
was playing violin solos. He is possibly the only actor
living who has played with Edmund Kean.v
Oscar Asche furnishes M.A.P. with his biography.
Born at Geelong, “ a Sleepy Hollow sort of a place.”
Spent childhood’s days fishing in Corio Baj\ Sent to
school away up in the “Dandelong” range. Saw Ned
Kelly and his gang there (did anybody else ?). Appeared
in school tableaux as Henry VIII. surrounded by his
wives. Afterwards went to the Melbourne Grammar
School. Studied for engineering. The dramatic society
of the school scouted him. Matriculated, and then went
for two years on a cattle station. Next employed at a
Victorian vineyard. Then at a Sydney wine merchant’s,
but only for three weeks. After that had a leisurely
time at home, his people being well in Acted in a piay
for the benefit of the Children’s Hospital, “ Royal Stan-
dard Theatre, Sydney. Sept. 13th, 1890.” Wanted to go
on the stage. His father was Norwegian, and said : “ If«
you want to be an actor you must go to Norway.” Went
accordingly. Studied at Bergen, under Manager Hansen.
Then went to Christiania. The manager said : “ You’re
an English actor; go to London.” Asche did. Got
nothing to do. Returned to Norway. Then “ the Aus-
tralian banks went smash ” and stranded him. Returned
to Lpndon. Engaged at the Opera Oomique by Arthur
Dacre and his wife, Amy Roselle. Had a five-line part in
“♦Man and Woman,” with the Dacrea, H. Neville, H.
Standing, Lena Ashweli, Eva Moore, &c. Then joined
Benson’s Shakspearian co.; with them from 1893 to 1901.
Married Lily Brayton.
“Adelaide”: “Hamlet’s” suggestion (8., 25/2/’O4)
that the Adelaide Royal needs an actor-manager, who
could play “East Lynne” and such things to keep the
house open in summer, is rendered idle by just one fact :
Adelaide wouldn’t go to see them if he did. This
small city has been over-educated in matters dramatic,
and will only have the best, though on that it will spend
its last shilling. The Broughs often took mate
money here —literally more, not just relatively *to
population—than in Melbourne. The same is' true
of the Bernard Beere visit, and doubtless of
others since. W.vbert Reeve departed, after a long
experience of resident managership, vowing bhat it was
the most difficult place imaginable to cater for ; all the
money you made ove’r some big attraction you lost in the
next forfenighUbver the Show put on to fill in time—per-
haps a quite respectable melodrama, which the public
absolutely ignored, and the newspapers described with
humorous contempt. Reasons : small ness of theatre-going
population, and comparative absence of visitors'to town.
Mtiny of the keenest supporters of the theatre are com-
paratively poor; but they contrive to see (once) every
new play that is known to be good, just by never spend-
ing on the seGond-rates or on revivals. Rickards is
having much the same experience at the Tivoli. Sandow,
Ginquevafli, and now Vulcana may test the holding capa-
city of the house, but for six months in between a
moderate co. is not drawing enough to pay expenses.
Inevitable result, an alternation of first-class attractions
with intervals of closed doors.
