“The Best Thoughts of the Best Men.”
A few weeks ago, on the occasion of a ques-
tion regarding tome Parliamentary records,
Premier Parkes was reported to have
stated from his place in the Assembly
that he wished the reports of the speeches
made in the New bouth ales Legislature
to be preserved intact chiefly because they
contained the best thoughts of our best men.
The claim that a colonial Assembly or a
political congress of any country contains
the best mei/in the colony or country, and
that iheir most valuable thoughts are to be
found in its records is a bold one. Let us
test it.
* * *
If by the “ best men ” are meant those of
the purest lives, the highest acquirements,
the choicest natural gifts, the broadest views
of mankind, ■or the keenest into
human nature, we deny the Premier’s as-
sumption. If by the “best thoughts” are
meant those which have done most to amuse
or instruct men ; to help along the world s
progress, dissipate the clouds of national
prejudice, or uphold the standard of civilisa-
t on, we deny it more emphatically st.ll. At
former periods of the world s history there
was a far greater tendency than at present
for able men to find their way into the
national councils. But at no period since
the myths of nomadic hordes gradually gave
place to trustwoithy annals will it be found
that: either the ablest men the nation could
bring had 1 places at the council-board, or,
liaVing them, took care to speak their best
thougnts from such pulpits. Confining our-
selves to the last hundred years or so, how
poor and mean, compared with those of
others, have been the contributions of the
worLds politicians totlm world s knowledge or
cuture! Take ti e bist of them—the two
Pitts, Burke, Pox, Castlebeagh Mel-
bourne, Macaulay, Aberdeen, Palmer-
ston, Gladstone, Disraeli, Bright, or
the foreign Thiers or Bismarck. Even ad-
mitting some of these to bo or to have been
men of a talent akin to genius, their best
thoughts were not uttered in Parliament,
but said or written outside it. Granting for
the sake of illustration that every spoken
and written word made use of by the pro-
minent men named had been uttered before
the assembled representatives of their
various countries, still how ignobly would
their incursions into the realms of fancy or
of fact compare with those of the gifted
men who gave us “ Faust,” “ Les Miser-
ables,” “ The Origin of (Species,” “ Sartor
Resartus,” “ The Stones of Venice,” or the
thousand-and-one literary and scientific
masterpieces which have changed not alone
the current of men’s thoughts but the face
of the globe they inhabit. The poor Ayr-
shire ploughman, who, from amidst squalid
surroundings sent forth the half-indignant,
half-defiant watchword, “A mans a man
for a’ that ; ” the struggling valetudinarian
who, tight in the grip of circumstances
almost as dismal, electrified England with
the “ Song of the Shirt ” struck truer notes
and preached loftier sermons than those
struck or preached by the “ Treatise on the
Sublime and Beautiful ” or the “ Lays of
Ancient Rome. '
♦ * *
So far from the best, i.e., the most
talented, men finding their way into poli
tical assemblies and enunciating their best
thoughts, the very contrary is the case, _ It
has long been recognised almost as an axiom
that to be successful as a politician you must
not be an intellectual head and-shoulders
over the community. In politics marked
mental superiority is a hindrance rather than
a help. The qualities that go to make a
profound thinker or a great discoverer
will either retard the representative’s ad-
vancement or altogether close the door of
public life in his face. Bismarck’s success
ia due not so rtmch to talent as to unscrupu
lousnesa. So was the first Napoleon’s ;so
was his putative nephew’s. No one who
has followed the great German statesman’s
career since the pour parleys preceding the
combined raid on little Denmark in 18G4
needed to read the late Count Beust s
memoirs to discover that the Iron Chancellor
was “ unscrupulous ” —the word is Beust s
—or, in the words of an English Minister,
un homme sans foi ni loi. Of the Bona-
partes it is scarcely necessary to speak.
Indeed, their work spoke for itself in the
volleys that rid the uncle of the inconvenient
Due D’Enghien and the nephew of the
December Kepubiicans. It Pas been said
that only a man of commanding genius could
have done what Bismarck hafs done—-could
have wielded into one homogeneous mass
the mutually-repelling members of a common
body arm fashioned a migh'ry empire before
tho eyes of astonished Europe. People who
say this forget- if they ever knew—-that for
centuries the teachings of the foremost
German thinkers have all been towards a
united Fatherland, and that to give Prince
Bismarck the credit of having accomplished
it is just about as sensible as to give a
clergyman credit for making a runaway
couple on©, because when they called at the
parsonage he happened to be the re to marry
them. No doubt the Prince united Ger-
many as the priest did the lovers, hut
neither Chancellor nor curate would have
been of mudb use if preceding events had
not paved th© way. 'The power wielded by
Bismarck was given him by the Dream of
Babbarossa.
* * *
The case of John Stuart Mill is an
illustration of the fact that in a constitu
tionally-governed country at least it is not
safe to be intellectually great if you desire
public life. It will not be denied that tho
famous British apostle of utilitarianism the
man who gave th© schools their best text-
book on logi<? and the world, tho fine examin-
ation of Hamilton’s philosophy—was a man
of parts or “of light arid leading.” The
latter phrase is Benjamin Disraeli’s. We
do not quite understand it, and never met a.
person who did ; but as it is now freely
quoted by all who- accept the primrose as a
power in politics, and as We are much at-
tached to that fiower and the cause it sym-
bolises, wo have as good a right as any to
Lord Beaconsfibld’s mystic utterances.
For a short time Mill represented West-
minster in the House of Commons, but his
thoughts were so much beyond the ken of
Sir Henry Parkes’ “best men” that the
latter gave expression to their views by
cock-crowing and other means. Soon Mill's
constituents deserted him, and he lost his
seat; not, however, before he had discovered,
as many others had done before him, that,
when a person is pregnant with a great
thought, Parliament is, perhaps, the worst
place of all in which to seek delivery.
* * *
It is time to turn to colonial Assemblies.
Before doing so, however, it would be as
well to point out that in a lately-published
and eminently successful American work,
entitled “ Triumphant Democracy,” the
author, Mr. Carnegie,, shows very clearly
how, when Democracy is in full swing, great
men are not only not required in the Legis-
lature, but are actually out of place there.
This opinion is so intrinsically probable, and
so consonant with the oft-quoted advice of
the Swedish statesman to his son, “Go
forth, my child ; travel, and see for yourself
how little wisdom is required to govern the
world,” that it may be accep cd without ar-
gument. And now, for colonial Parliamems.
At the very beginning it might be as well
to clear the ground by throwing out a chal
lenge. Our challenge is this: We will
undertake never again to say a word
about the £25 due to us by the N.S.W.
Minister for Mines, Mr. Abigail, for
proving him—for proving, that is, how he
made a mistake in saying he never advocated
a Protective policy in any form—if his col-
league the Premier will point out in any
colonial Hansard a thought or idea of worth
which had not been differently or better ex-
pressed by some English or colonial writer
or speaker. We do not exclude the Parlia-
mentary utterances of Sir Henry Parkes
himself. We shall go even further, and say
that he (the Premier) is at liberty to search
not alone hia own extra-Parliamentary
speeches, but the published volumes of hia
poetry for such evidences of originality. In
one sense, no doubt, this challenge is rash,
as British poesy contains nothing so truly
original as the best of Sir Henry s stanzas.
In fact, there appeared to be but one link
wanting in the great chain of originality,
and in the “ Murmurs of the Streams ” he
found it. Still, having thrown down the
glove, we shall not budge.
* *, *
In the self-governing colonies of Australia
—if the term “self-government” can be
fairly applied to provinces which are obliged
to accept their supreme executive officers
from the ends of the earth, and which have
their supreme appellate court in a little
island twelve thousand miles away—there is
but one way of learning how members speak
when they speak at all, and what they say
when they say anything. This is by attend-
ing the Parliamentary debates, it is popu-
larly supposed that if you cannot hear them
speak you can at all events read in the morn-
ing journals or in Hansard what they say.
Such is not the case. Before Hansard goes
to press they are allowed to make certain
emendations, while, so far as the newspaper
reports are concerned, each broad sheet
makes a member speak or not, say this or
that, just as it likes. Attend a session, then,
if you have time, and we guarantee that it
will not be time wasted. Before you, ac-
cording to Sir Henry Parkes, are the
colony’s best men. . Why they do not use
better English is puzzling. Minister and
member ; old hand (parliamentary) and raw
recruit rise in their places and fairly be-
wilder the listener with wordy slip slop. It
is rare to hear from any of the intellectual
elite assembled half-a-dozen consecutive sen-
tences of fairly correct English. And the
thoughts drtssed in this motley language are
worthy of their apparel. It is droll to listen
to a Minister of the Crown as he enunciates
vulgar thoughts in the language of a Mrs.
Malaprop. Droller still to listen to his
claim for the pre-eminence of such bourgeois
speculations and of the men who gave tnem
utterance. The first thing that is apt to
suggest itself to a strange visitor to any
colonial Legislature is, “if the men before
me are the best the country can produce, it
must be depressing to see and hear the
worst or even the second best.”
* * *
The fact is, the foremost minds of a com-
munity are never found among its rulers or
its representatives, and, as the world grows
older, there is less chance than ever of the
brightest intellects taking to politics. Nor,
as Carnegie points out, is it either necessary
or desirable that they should. Except in
great crises like that which resulted in the
sweeping away of American slavery. Govern-
ment, particularly of the Democratic tvpe,
requires not so much commanding abilities
as plain coramonsense and unsullied honesty.
It has too long been the custom to attribute
to public men a superiority which they were
far from possessing. This tendency is even
more observable in new countries than in
old, and the politicians of the former are not
slow to take advantage of it. Take Victoria,
for instance. Her public men will not sulier
by comparison with those of New
South Vv ales. The present Chief Justice
Higinbotham can certainly hold his own
for intellectual or moral excellence against
any New South Wales public man of the past
or of the present. But what has Mr.
Higinbotham said or done that will be re-
membered as long as some of the poems of
Gordon ? By his views on the precise
position to be assigned to Jesus and the
apostles he caused, it is true, a gentle flutter
among the miserable Melbourne sinners who
mortify the flesh on five thousand a year
and alio use at Toorak. But Mr. Higin-
botham’s scepticism is of the mildest
and daintiest sort. It is merely the
A B C of unbelief. To anyone ac-
quainted with the writings of the great
German, French, and English thinkers, the
idea of the judges having told the world
anything it did not know before, is laughter-
provnkiug. Again, take the case of the late
Marcus Clarke. Gibbon, one of the
greatest scholars of the E'ghteenth Oentuiy,
and the incomparably greatest historian of
any, wrote of Fielding, “He was of tie
younger branch of the Earls of Denbigh,
who drew their origin from the Counts of
Hapsburgh. The successors of Charles V.
may di dam their brethren of England ; but
the romance of ‘ Tom Jones,’ that exquisite
picture of humour and manners, will outlive
the paiace of the Escurial and the Imperial
Eagle of Austria.” And it might be said
with equal truth that the story of “His
Natural Life,” that terrible picture of man s
! inhumanity to man, will outlive the memo-
j ries, not alone of Sir Henry Parkes’ best
! men, but of their best thoughts—will be
1 read with mingled auger and pity when the
! very name of the Victorian Premier, Gillies,
who now denies a pittance t . the author’s
struggling widow, has gone down, in com-
pany with those of Sir Henry’s favourites,
to a common and unregretied oblivion.
The Bonouring of Office.
The State and strictly insular religion of the Eng-
lish is primarily responsible for the limitless and
unspeakable evils wrought by official slowness,
blundering, corruption, and thieving
wherever the British plant themselves. Right
through the centuries the people have been taught
by priests fatted and pampered by ihe State, to
rest their hopes of everlasting salvation on a
blind, uncritical faith in the sanctity and power
for gocd of the Sovereign and all his underlings.
The formula runs: ‘'Fear God and honour the
Kicg,” the teaching whereof is plainly that the
head of the State is a vicegerent of the .almighty,
and to dishonour him —to criticise, that is, his
performances whether personal or by proxy—is to
commit blasphemy and incur divine wrath and
eternal retribution. In order that there should be
no mistake as to the extent of the area over which
the religious awe of the people for officialdom
must be spread, if the anger of the Deity is to be
stayed or appeased, the Church has gone carefully
into details, and enumerated a long list of func-
tionaries who must perforce be implicitly obeyed
and held in deep respect, ending with the toler-
ably complete summary : “ And all persona placed
in authority over us.”
** * .
In England itself the outcome of this “ reli-
gious'’ instruction is a monstrous condition o>
official incompetency an d crooked def ding, extendic g
down from Victoria, by the grace of God Queen.
Defender of the Faith, and so forth—down
through all the departments, of Government to
the petty constables and parish beadles. That
the Queen herself sets an example of both
these things is a proposition supported by
abundant ar.d unimpeachable proofs. In the dis-
charge of her simplest duties she is obstinate and
wrongheaded to a degree calculated to drive from
the service of the country all ministers of large
capacity and independence of thought; and she is
perpetually raising a fuss over matters almost too
puerile to engage the attention of a child As to
her official purity, Sir Charles Dilke and other
competent authorities have proved that she
annually pockets at least £lOO,OOO in defiance of
the Civil List Act, which statute provides that any
portion of the £172,000 yearly allowed for her
tradesmen’s bills, not actually expended for the
I purpose named, shall be returned to the Treasury,
while vouchers for more than £60,000 to £70,000
l er annum have not been forthcoming since 1862.
And the methods and conduct of her Majesty ad-
mirably typify the methods and conduct of the
whole pack of red-tapeists and hangers-on who run
the machinery of Government, general and muni-
cipal. Yet in England the “best” people raise
their hands in pious horror if anybody ventures to
whisper the patent facts of the situation. The
superstition instilled into them for ages about
honouring the king and obeying and venerating
all persons placed by him in authority over them
holds in bonds inextricable their reason ; and they
submit patiently to unjust laws, to the cruel
and biased administration of the same, to govern-
ment in the interests of the classes and inimical
to the masses all along the line, to a political con-
stitution and a social system honeycombed with
corruption and alive with crawling parasites ; and
are content with a State pyramid with nothing in
the shape of honest substantiality about it save
the hangman who stands minaciously on its apex.
* * *
Here in Australia the same superstition,
though no doubt to a less extent, bars the
way of justice and progress at every point. Ah
important modicum of that “ divinity which doth
hedge a King,’’ according to the partly inherited
and partly acquired belief of the people, descends
upon every piece-holder under Government ; and
what is euphemistically called “public opinion”
is shocked if anyone who has contrived to free
himself from the popular delusion dares to give
expression to adverse criticism on an erring public
servant. The consequence is that the laws, often
bad enough in themselves in all conscience, at
times are so atrociously administered as to make
the very name of “justice” a byword and a re.
proach ; while, as for the management of extra-
judicial affairs, that is simply a nauseous pot-
pourri of inefficiency and theft, A majority of the
officials are not base enough or clever enough tosteal*
but exhaust their intellectual powers in strenuous
efforts to discover the rationale of how not to do
anything whatsoever. A fair proportion, it ill
fair to say, are of superior capacity, and hence
the public arc robbed one Way and another to ah
extent incalculable, and in a manner shrouded in
I that closest cf all veils —the “ open secret,” known
to everjbody, but of which it is not the proper
caper for anybody to whisper. This state of things
cannot continue much longer, either in the
Mother Country or in the communities that have
inherited the blasting prostration of reason which
underlies the condition. Already in Englaid
politicians and writers in the Press are beginning
to sound what bids fair to swell into the death-
knell of the “fear God and honour-thc-Queen”
doctrine, and when that is gotten rid of the rest
is all plain sailing. In Australia, nobody, with
the exception of one or two uninfluential poli-
ticians, has attacked public servants with any
success. Ihe fault lies almost entirely with the
Press, which, in these colonies, lacks well nigh
every quality that goes to make public journalism
a ub ful and beneficent institution. The Aus-
tralian Press has no originality of thought, no
real honesty of purpose, and, above all, has not the
courage of its convictions. It is always “on the
wait.” watebir g to see how the cat jumps, and
has never yet bten instrumental in initiating any
important reform, or assis ing materially in the
advancement of a refoim, until the end was on
the eve of realisation.
• «■ ♦
This characteristic cf the Australian Press has
recently been exemplified in a remarkable manner.
The hideous facts of the notorious Mount Rennie
trial are still frt sh in the minds of the public. On
the very morning of the infamous execution of
four lads, whose guilt of the offence imputed was
never satisfactorily proved, the S.M. Herald,
which lor weeks previously had preserved an apa-
thetic attitude in the matter, came out with an
article severely condemnatory of the conduct of
the trial, the innuendo of the whole contention
being that the Judge who presided thereat was
unfitted for his hgh office. Here is a sample of
I the Herald’s argumentation in its own words,
the italics being the present writer’s :
“ Jl is the rcvff essence of our criminal jurisprudence that
everp prisoner should not only be allowed the benefit of counsel
in, his defence, but that every reasonable facility should be
afforded him by the Court as well as by the Crown, It has
rarely happened that any cause for complaint in this respect
has arisen of late years; but the present instance is a proof
that even this merciful rule is not without its exceptions.
Whatever the facilities afforded to prisoners on ,their trial
may be, they can be of little avail ichen the sittings of the Cour
are protracted from day to day to such an extreme as to ex-
haust the physical and mental energies of counsel and jurymen
alike. The celebrated Tichborne trial in England was only
one of many instances in which Courts presided over by the
most eminent of English Judges have patiently sat from day
to day, for weeks together, for the purpose of administering
justice in the merciful spirit of English law. But no case has
been heard of in modern times in which English Judges have
compelled jurors and counsel in criminal cases involving issues
of life and death to sit all through the night in spite of repeated
2>rotcsts and requests for adjournment .”
For the Herald this account is very, very strong.
Ic might have added that the same Judge exhi-
bited a like indecent and unwarrantable haste in
the trial of Johns (an undefended prisoner, after-
wards hanged) on a capital charge ; and it might
have argued with more directness that, so
far from calling upon accused persons to defend
themsfflves in the small hours of the morning, it


was the bounden duty of a British. Judge to pro -
Mbit a prisoner from so doing, even if the latter
were so foolish as to wish to engage in the task.
But the story is good enough. It sufficiently jus-
tifies the belief that Judge Windeyer violated
the fundamental principles of natural, not to
cantingly say British, justice.
* * *
Well, in the Victorian Assembly a few days ago
Mr. David Gaunson, influenced in no small
measure most probably by the above-quoted judg-
ment, animadverted in strong terms on the con-
duct and character of the judge concerned ; and
forthwith the selfsame paper, which had'demon-
strated that that functionary represented in his
conduct something like the negation of justice,
discovers that Mr. Justice Windeyer even
under the circumstances complained of by Mr.
Gaukson, rendered a valuable service to society,
and that his accuser is guilty of “ruffianly
coarseness,” and other dreadful things. The
Herald is brimful of pious horror at Gaunson’s
assault on “a resolute administrator of the law,
and protector of the interests of the weak against
lawlessness and violence ” ! This is the old stand-
point of the place-and-power worshippers. The
holder of office is always to these infatuated
beings the protector of the weak and deserving—
for the king reigns by Divine right, and the
authority of the placeman is simply the delegated
authority of the king, and therefore of God, They
don’t stop to observe that it not unfrequently hap-
pens that the alleged “ protector of the weak ” is
in reality the assailant of the weak. If there is any
truth whatever in the Herald’s statements of
January 7, Justice Windeyer showed himself to
be, to all intents and purposes, a resolute foe
of the true spirit of the law, r - of weak-
ness as personified in the accused wretche->
brought before him for trial, and a friend and ad-
vocate for power, as represented by the Crown
and its minions. The horrid superstition referred
to will not permit of chose circumstances being
perceived, however plain and prominent they may
be. The simple fact that Justice Windeyer is
“ placed in authority over us ” negatives in what
these people are pleased to call their minds the
suspicion that he can be fallible, and the doubt
that he can be otherwise than omnipotent on the
side of truth and justice. The Herald, mark
you, uses Mr. Gaunson simply as a pivot on
which to turn the old idolatry of power. So far
as Mr. Gaunson is concerned, very likely he did go
beyond the issue. But our task to-day is not to
defend Mr. Gaunsons “ruffianly coarseness” cr
his point of view in any way where it differs from
that of the Herald's own prior argument. No
added strength is needful to make out a sufficient
case against Mr. Justice Windeyer, and the sys-
tem of transmitted Divine right of which he is a
creature.
* * *
It assuredly behoves the people of Australia to
break the false glamour that has been cast
upon them by the well-paid industry of their ‘ ‘spiri-
tual pastors and masters ”in the past. As things
go we are simply perpetuating a state of things in-
volving misery and wretchedxms 3 for the mas?es
of the people as the complement of the unnatural
ease and luxury enjoyed by the “classes.” It is
an axiom of sociology that “ an unjust reward is
the indirect cause of injustice ad infinitum.” To
secure tolerable comfort for the multitude the in-
efficient and backsliding holders of tffi ;e must all
be cast nto outer darkness as a condition precedent.
Howlongaperiod wifi elapse before this is generally
perceived is a problem hard to solve. One would
sometimes think the end too remote to be taken
into account. But the human race has occasion-
ally had a sudden awakening—has cast away
ancient beliefs and superstitions between the
rising and the setting of the sun, and returned to
reason as to the True God after ages spent in
bowing before gilded creations of priestcraft and
kingcraft. It is surely not taking a too optimist
view to trust that in the near future Australians
at any rate will pitch the played-out absurdities
of the English to the winds, judge every public
servants strictly on his merits, and insist on legis-
lators and administrators alike performing in the
interests of the whole body of the people. In such
oase, Mr. Justice Windeyer, we submit with
Peat confidence, would be impossible, inasmuch
13 however able and conscientious he may be he
safficted with mental defects which render it
utterly inexpedient that he should continue to dis-
pense criminal law from a bench of justice.

charge of 2s. per 1000 gallons, which is about cost
price. But the Colonial Secretary refused to pay
the charge, on the ground that the asylum was
a hospital or a charitable institution, which
are specially exempted in “ country towns ” from
paying for the water supplied them by municipal
corporations. This matter has been before the
Primary Judge in Equity for some weeks, and has
manifestly cost his Honor a vast amount of
laborious research into antique statutes, commen-
taries, dictionaries, and other means of enlight-
ment. The industrious Sir W. Manning said
there could be no doubt whatsoever that morally
the Government ought to pay, but the question
was whether it could be legally made to pay. If
that is so, then why should Government raise
any dispute ? The sum claimed was less than £SO
per annum. The costs in the case will probably
amount to at least ten years’ rates, not to mention
the loss involved in the wasted time of the Judge
and other public functionaries engaged in the
settlement. It is curious to note that in this
matter the moral and the legal rights were not,
contrary to custom, mercilessly cast asunder by the
court. His Honor decided wholly in favour of
the Borough Council with costs against the Go-
vernment—for the good and sufficient reason that
the asylum in question is neither a hospital nor a
charitable institution. The direct and indirect
outlay maybe set down at £2ooo—forty years’
payment of the charge in dispute ; and yet people
wonder why the unfortunate Judges can’t get
through their work, and wonder why the Govern-
ment is troubled with a constantly-increasing
deficit.

Parkes’ State House.
When Premier Parkes submitted his scheme for
the “fitting celebration of the hundredth anniver-
sary of the colony ” he waxed “ immense ” touch-
ing the State House feature of the programme.
On an elevated site in the proposed Centennial
Park he recommended the erection of “ an edifice
for great national purposes.” This, he said, was
“ not to bean ordinary hall or museum, but a
great structure, identified with the national life
of the country.” “All countries,” he went on to
say, “ have some spot which maybe characterised
as the home of their national life, some place
which may be considered the altar on which their
highest offerings are laid, some place round which
the nation, as such, rallies on great occasions.”
And this “great structure” was to be
designed and constructed so as to provide
“a great hall or amphitheatre" wherein
could be held “ great national assemblages and
commemorative celebrations and services of a
national or special character.” It was also to
contain a suite of apartments “ for the proper
keeping and exhibition of such archives, records,
and memorials of the colony as may hereafter be
collected and preserved ‘' all books, documents,
maps, printed or written matter, and reliques as
may be illustrative of the historical, material, and
industrial stages of the colony’s progress, and of
the various aboriginal races of Australia, their
customs, languages, and ethnological characteris-
tics.” It was to contain, furthermore, “ a gallery
for the reception of statues and pictures ” ; and,
finally, “ a public mausoleum for the interment of
those who have been honoured with a public
funeral.” All through his speech on that occasion
Parkes’ keynote was grandeur. His State House
was to be not less “ great” in point of size than
the “ great national” genius and aspiration it was
intended to ty \ ify. The idea of a vast amphitheatre
in which the multitude might congregate and weep
over dead heroes, or glorify living specimens of the
genus, was conveyed in every sentence ; and the
Assembly was fairly carried away by the electric
contagion of the brilliant and imposing concep-
tion. But Parkes had a different tale to tell last
week. Having secured Parliamentary sanction
to his scheme, he advertised for competitive
designs, proffering the munificent reward of £l5O
to the architect who succeeded in getting his
plans declared, by some unknown authority, the
most suitable ; and the Sydney architects waited
on him with the complaints that this offer filled
them with surprise and grief, that they never
before felt so humiliated, and that no body of
professional gentlemen had ever-hither to had to
submit to “such a slap in the face.” Parkes
tnereupon proceeded to unsay all he had told the
House about the “great structure.” A popu'ar
error had somehow arisen, he averred, as to the
need for an enormous building. The great hall or
amphitheatre was in fact to dwindle into a small
apanment. “The Mausoleum would be quiie a
small place—only a few bodies would be deposited
there.” The gallery of art would be strictly
limited in area; while, as for the historical, in-
dustrial, ethnological, &c,, museum, that might,
we are led to suppose, be omitted altogether, for
the whilom eloquent advocate of this “great
feature” of the “Centennial Palace” was last
week silent on the subject. This is extremely
disappointing, and so the architects seem to feel.
They went to Parkes inbuad with the idea that
the State House is a “ grand conception, looking as
it does into the dim vista of futurity, when mil-
lions of people yet unborn will inhabit this great-
territory, and be able to look back with approval
upon tuis statesmanlike act of a nation’s love and
pride of country in its Centennial year,” and more
than ever filled with surprise and grief to hear
from the originator’s own lips that his amphi-
theatre, art gallery, musaum, and Charnel house
were intended to be stowed away in a Liliputian
edifice, the designing whereof was not worth
more than £l5O. Thus nas the mighty project
shrunk and shrivelled as its practical fulfilment is
approached. By and by we shall hear that the
exigencies of the N.S. W. Treasury will not permit
of the “ great national palace” being larger than
a sentry-box. or smaller than a tin of sardines, or
more architectural than a galvanised iron shed.
Judge Higinbotham’s recent re-affirmation of
his Unitarian principles has sent Melbourne piety
circles into a state of ferment. The smug-faced
crew to whom “ doxies ” and “ isms” are meat
and drink (and plenty of both) are girding up
their loins for the inevitable newspaper fray.
They are grinding out columns of theology so
weird and mysterious that, after sitting up all
night with the blessed correspondence, we have
come to the conclusion that the terew faith wants
more finding than a winner of the local Cup. It
would have been better if Higia botham had kept
his ideas strictly to himself, and not caused excited
crowds to gather at the corners of Melbourne
streets to discuss the Deity from a materialistic
standpoint. Moreover, we disapprove of religion
getting into tha hands of the lawyer chaps. They
will so cumber it with technicalities that unless a
man takes his case right away to the Higher
Court he won’t be able to save his immortal soul
in the short space of a lifetime. Pretty soon no
one will be able to say the simplest prayer under
six and-eightpence. ,
The leading articles of the S.M. Herald are re
markable for their length, their stupidity, and
their obscurity. When they can be followed
along their tortuous passages they will be seen to
cordially shake by the hand Imperialism, Jingo-
nsm, and Property. Such an article last Friday
stated that Republican institutions gave little
security for property, that their existence de-
pended upon a chapter of accidents, and that a
barricade or two in the streets with the rising of
the populace might destroy them in a day. Pooh '
A contented populace never yet rebelled against
good law and order, such being according to their
wishes. And the “ History of England ” tells us
a different tale than that of monarchies respecting
property. But the creed of the Herald is that
ot the rulers of the day, which is opposed to the
creed of the people. Have we not now to witness
under monarchy the steel-gloved defence of pro-
perty in Ireland against the wishes of the people ?
the tyrannical powers given to property holders
and their sympathisers there by the Crimes Act
will be used with brutal force against the people ;
but the greater the oppression the likelier the
revolt
The blessings derived by Australia from her
partnership in the Empire are again illustrated by
the Imperial income-tax levied on Australians
residing in Great Britain, although their income
is drawn from this country, a Frenchman, or any
other foreigner, escapes this impost because he
hasn t got a dear old mother country. To tax
Australian property, no matter by whom held, is
simply infernal impudence on the part of any
foreigner whatever, and ought to be met by a
good stiff tax on all English assets owned out here.
• it for tat is fair measure, but we fancy i hat Eng-
land would ba the first to stand in astonishment
at the process when so applied to herself. Of
course the above rule should apply equally to all
taxes, so it would be as well for (say) Victoria to
send in an account to the English Government for
the amount of protective duty estimated to be
due on goods imported into Britain for the con-
sumption of Australians who live or have capital
invested there.
We have before us a copy of the N.S, Wales
Freetrade Association’s income and expenditure
for the past year, and a remarkably cheerful piece
of reading it is. Including the noble band of
half-crown donators to the good cause, there are
about 300 city subscribers on the list, Messrs.
Hardib and Gorman, Fairfax and Sons (of the
S.M. Herald), John Frazer and Cos., topping
the columns with £SO each; the amount pooled
for the year ending June 30th, 1887, is £llolss. 2d
The monster Freetrade banquet, at which old
Jack Robertson so unmercifully trounced the
cadging business,'realised £lßl 165., and out of
this the committee paid away £l9B 3s. 3d. What
became of the balance is not stated, but in all
probability it was laid aside for funeral expenses
to be spent when the day should arrive to bury
the cause for ever. The Association’s deficiency
up to now borders on £SOO, and it is significant that,
ah hough the landlord of the rooms in which the
Association’s business is done is a staunch Free-
trader, still he has faithfully promised to land the
whole of the official paraphernalia into the street
if his little bill be not promptly settled. It must
be a phthisical cause when not a single Calico
Jimmy, or soft-goods magnate in the land thinks
it worth while to put up even a “fiver” to save
its Lares and Penates from the degrading grip of
the bum-bailiff.
The Case of William Roy.
The Bulletin has so far acknowledged subscrip-
tions to the amount of £l6 3s. 9d. received by it
on behalf of William Roy, the soldier who now
lies blind and paralysed in Parramatta Asylum
As already stated, Roy wears the distinguished
conduct medal, awarded him for his gallant con-
duct at Roike’s Drift, where, though at the time
an invalid, he rushed through the flames during
the fight to save the sick from the burning hospi-
tal. He subsequently received from the hands of
the Queen an autograph Bible, end his portrait is
to be seen in the celebrated painting by De Neu-
ville now in the New South Wales National
Gallery. The unfoitunate man, who since
his admission to the wretched asylum that
is now his home, has, according to the
report of the gentlemen appointed to enquire into
the management of the N.S.W. Government
charities, been treated with wanton neglect and
cruelty, is in a hopeless condition of health, and
will while he lingers be utterly dependent on the
good offices of those who may wish to make a
substantial protest against the hollow-hearted
system which, while it spends lavishly to com-
memorate triumphs gained chiefly at the cost and
never for the benefit of the class from which the
common soldier id drawn, callously permits a
brave private to die in misery. The Bulletin
hopes to collect a considerable sum for Roy, and
undertakes to see that he is directly benefited by
its expenditure. The following additional dona-
tions are now thank/ully acknowledged :

Editor Bulletin,-The history of Ireland since
the Union has been one long series of Coercion
-Bills, earned by majorities in an English Parlia-
ment in the teeth of the bitter opposition of the
constitutional representatives of four-fifths of the
Irish people. The latest of the black record is de-
scribed by the greatest Englishman of the day as
a causeless, insulting and insidious Bill, intended
to create a crisis. Doubtless, Mr. Gladstone
meant thereby that it was meant to exasperate
the Irish to desperate expedients, and hence give
the Tories the long-wished-for opportunity for an
indiscriminate use of lead and steel. The Tories
know well that there is only one way to govern
Ireland from Westminster—by blood and iron.
They have not yet had, in this reign, a valid ex-
cuse. Perchance, they think the Crimes Act will
create one—that an outraged people will grow
weary of waiting and resent this last crowning in-
sult by an appeal to force. It would be vair.
The Irish would be crushed to the earth—wiped
out. There would be a great silence, and the
Ministerial report would be that there was peace
and contentment in Ireland. It would be the
peace and content of Poland. Some special ex-
cuse has been brought forward for every coercion
bil!; but the rea! aim of all of these appeals to
legalised force has been to stamp out the just and
natural desire of the Irish people to exercise their
inherent right to be governed by their own repre-
sentatives in their own way. Yet people dare to
wonder that the Irish love not the Union The
marvel would be if they did. Love is not‘gained
by tyranny, and it is tyranny pure and simple to
persistently withold from a nation its natural
rights—rights enjoyed by the Australian colonies
and to crush out with an iron hand every legi-
timate attempt to attain the use of those rights
This is what majorities in the British Parliament*
which is based on the principle that laws should
be made for the people and with the people’s con-
currence, have been persistently supporting. This
is why the Irish hate the Union, and this is
wherefofe Home Rule is dearer to every virile
than all other things earthly are. Till
the Gagging Bill to close the mouths of his repre-
sentatives in the English Parliament had passed
into practice, and till the last blow of the Crimes’
Act is consummated, there might still be some
satisfaction to the patriots of Ireland in continuing
to send representatives to the House of Commons
and m patiently bearing with the restricted liberty
of free speech they enjoyed at home, for there
was still some means to defend and plead then-
country a cause ; but now the ever-present gag
and soon the gaping prison, await and will awaß
the lush delegate and the Irish agitator who dare
to proclaim their nation’s rights. There is no longer
hope at Westminster. It is now noplace for the re-
presentatives of Ireland, and their best way of im-
pressing this fact on the world and of moving the
hearts of nations would be by shaking off the dust
of their feet against St. Stephen’s. Let them rise
as one man in their places in that House, and in the
presence of the assembled legislators of Britain pro-
claim that they appealed from the decision of that
Assembly to the people of the United Kingdom ;
that they repudiated its decrees, and that their
places in that House should know them no more
till the people of Great Britain should rectify the
wrongs and establish the rights of their outraged
country. Let the Irish Representatives then pass
over into Ireland and meet in Convention in com-
pany with the noble leaders of the English.
Democracy. Let them state their case as
nearly as the letter of the Coercion Act
would allow, and publish a manifesto to
the Democracy of the Empire, and if this docu-
ment bore the signature and was upheld by the
voice of William Ewart Gladstone, and the
other great Liberal leaders, it would, un-
der the circumstances of its issue’ ap-
peal irresistibly to the hearts of tens of' thou-
sands who, though loving their liberty, have not
thought of Ireland. For the rest let the people
present a calm, patient front to the Crimes’ Bill.
Let it be met with such a wide and universal and
relentless boycott as has not yet been known in
Ireland. Let this passive resistance—though it
causes a burden, grievous and scarcely to be
borne to the national defenders as well as to the
emissaries of the strangerc— but be firmly and un-
flinchingly carried out, and the Crimes Act and
much other authority beside it will beat the air o •
serve no other purpose than to exist as an emblem
of tyranny and as a band of iron to strengthen tho
union of the patriots of Ireland. Let it bo
boycotted in the cradle, at the altar and tho
grave, in the streets and in the fields, at the table
and the fireside, in the market-place and in tho
chapel. Boycott it in sickness and in health, in
joy and in sorrow, in riches and in poverty. Let
it be boycotted to-day and to-morrow and to
death. Thus will an act of tyranny perish, and
thus will the Irish people defeat the malice of
their enemies, and thus will they show by a
Spartan determination to suffer ail for liberty that
they are worthy of its enjoyment —Yours truly,
W. Mackworth Harrison, Charters Towers’
North Queensland, 2nd July, 1887.

Although the intense selfishness of man
Protrudes its brazen front and leads the van,
A nobler view of life exists I
Although a gilded monarchy may rule,
Supported by the sycophantic school—
An independent spirit lives I
Although there are the dukes, the earls, the lords,
the bishops, and such leeches now in hordes—
The people are, and they advance!
Although a few, now poor, in time grow rich,
I orgetting then they left the human ditch—
Ihc truest hearts, they never will!
Although the poor, who’ve neither lands nor food,
Incited are to spill each other’s blood—
They know not what they do-they will t
Although the superstitions still prevail
To tempt a ghostly and a yellow gale—
Undaunted science daily grows I
A nobler view of life exists to thwart
The selfish feelings of the human heart,
And soon will lead the van !
An independent spirit lives and spreads
To tear the garb of monarchy to shreds—
For monarchy is doomed !
The people now advance to life’s ideal
(Equality, fraternity)—they feel
That Liberty triumphs !
The truest hearts, no matter rich or poor,
Are leading on, and victory is sure—
Then social life is gained !
The people then will know and guard their power,
And help the helpless, who will blessings shower
On happy social homes !
Let Science flash its all-reflecting light
And educate the world that Right is Might —
And Right the only God !

serve a man when he is straining his every nerve

There are two Deans at Winchester, one a

Somebody sent a wire to “ Dean. Winchester ”
(the trainer), after the Derby. It was wrongly
delivered, and so it fell out that as solemn ser-
vice was progressing and the Dean sat enthroned,
a telegram was handed to him, and he opened it
and cast his eyes up to heaven in dire perplexity,
for it said : “ Ormond has won !”

Prime-Meat Barry’s Patter Song,
THE BISHOP’S PREVARICATION;
or,
“ITS OWING TO THE MEAT”
I find It is reported in a wicked Sydney sheet
That I told the English people the Australian
elite
Were sensual and lawless and consumed their
whisky neat.
Now what 1 really said to them I’ll with your
leave repeat:
I said that you were wicked, but I laid the blame
on Meat;
I told them that for beauty none could with your
girls compete,
They were e’egant and neat, they were sweet, but
indiscreet
(But I said their indiscretion was brought on by
eating meat.)
I told them that your working man his wife and
children beat,
Twas not drink that made him do it —it was
what he had to eat.
I told them Sydney s’atesmen were puffed out
with vain conceit,
That the height of their ambition was to use their
fists and feet,
Considering it was quite the thing to wrestle in
the street,
And that rather than pay railway fares they’d
ride beneath the seat
(But I added it was owing to Demoralising Meat).
I told them your policemen found dead babies on
their beat
With a Herald or a Telegraph to serve as
winding sheet,
But I told them this sad state of things was caused
by Sydney meat.
I told them that ycur Harbour they would find it
hard to beat,
And that your beef and mutton they would find it
hard to eat;
I told them Sydney tramcars were considered
quite a treat
To anyone vho had a taste for soot, dust, smoke,
and heat.
Now, I think that I have told you all I don’t wish
to secrete,
So hope if any people think me guilty of deceit
They’d say, as I have said for them, “ It's owing to
the meat.”

That scientific society upon the Stanislow
could have learned much at Penrith, N.S.W.,
where an awful ghost story has just gone bung.
The other day, at Penrith, one or two people saw
a troubled-looking apparition prowling round a
dark and lonely spot. It was plain a horrible
murder had been committed, so they searched the
spot in daylight. Yes, there were the remains of
the assassinated victim—there were his broken
ribs, the fragments of his poor skull, the decayed
and tattered remnants of his rags. By and bye
the coroner took possession of the bones and
handed them over to anatomical experts, who
pronounced that “ while none of the portions of
bone could be affirmed to be parts of a human
being, some of them were undoubtedly those of a
lower order of animal." But The Bulletin re-
spectfully submits that the inquest must go on,
inasmuch as there is nothing in the report incon-
sistent with the theory that the bones formed part
of one or more of the electors hy wh m Sammy
Lees was returned to the N.S.W. Parliament.
Victoria by the Grace appears to pursue a policy
of ‘‘slobber” on all public occasions. Royal
functions are en'iveqed by little family kissing
games for the delectation of the newspaper re-
porters. Thus we read that after the West-
minister Abbey service there was more lip prac-
tice than you can ste anywhere outdde a Sunday
school picnic when the teachers get together.
Sassiety organs have furni-hed full particulars of
this “ pretty scene of family affection.” First of
all plump Bektie made an emotional peck at his
royal mother's hand, and was awarded wi h a
chaste salute on the cheek bone. Then two other
princes made their pecks, but retired without
being muzzled by their august relative. Sud-
denly the Queen (in accordance with stage busi-
ness previously arranged by the Lord Chamber-
lain) was “carried away by the impulse of the
moment,” and commenced to kiss the whole
family circle. The two princes were recalled and
received their “ busses” like everybody else. It
was sublime. Not a dry eye was left in the Abbey
when this ostentatious osculation had come to an
end. By such shallow devices does Her Gracious
keep her fat salary and perks,

Mr. Dampier having apparently, like
many another good man, made his pile with
“Rags and Bones,.” had them carted off the
boards of the Royal Standard on Monday, to make
room for. our persecuted Jewish friend of the last
century. “Leah, the Forsaken.” This drama is
strung into five acts, which impress one with the
belief that old-time Christians, instead of ham-
mering one another for the love of God, as they
do now-a-days, confined their persecuting charity
to the pork-scorning Hebrew. Most of the per-
secution is showered on Leah, who consoles her-
self by annexing the heart of Rudolf, a Gentile
masher, already engaged to a fair young thing
wich flaxen hair and a snowy apron. With the
aid of an apostate Jew, Rudolf is led to believe
that Leah is only in love with his money, and he
returns to the arms of his fair Anna, after having
cast off Leah with more force than scorn. Rudolf
then leads the fair Anna to the altar, or rather
Anna leads him, when Leah again turns
up and invokes the names of all the
patriarchs from Adam to her uncle in a
malediction upon her faithless swain that would
have made a bullock-driver burst with envy.
Rudolf studies the pattern of the carpet while his
jilted girl is doing the cursing, but he lives long
enough to make atonement and obtain forgiveness
from Leah, who exposes Nathan, the villain, and
then dies right off just when the audience are be
ginning to think that Rudolf ought to forsake bis
gentle Anna or get a divorce and marry Leab.
Miss Lily Dampier as Leah was tearfully pathetic,
and Mr. Dampier as Nathan, the bald-headed
apostate, made a remarkably murderous-loukicg
sneaking persecutor. Mr. Edmund Holloway was
quite at home in the shoes of Lorenz, the fa-nur
and magistrate. Rudolf, filled by Mr. A. Booth
man, requires a little more practice in love
making. Mr. W. E. Baker was quite holy as
Father Hermann, while Mr, H. Beaten filled the
dual requirements of doctor and barber success-
fully. Miss Annie Marsh, as Anna, fairly filled
the duties of a less than umally jealous sweet-
heart and wife.

At Sydney Criterion the “Pickpocket”
continues to draw full benches. Young Dion
Boucicault, as Andrew, the writer, grows upon
you the more you see him ; and the ancient Har-
wood, who is always growing upon his audience,
inasmuch as every night he perpetrates some
fresh gag, is greater and greater as Grumbledon.
The piece looks like having quite a run.

Bland Holt’s “ second novelty ” at the
Sydney Royal is emotional and dreadful enough
to please the most enthusiastic devotee of the
sensational, and awfully realistic notwithstanding
its extravagance. “Alone in London,” as the
play is somewhat inappropriately called, deals to
a large extent with the se imy side of life, and the
authors succeed, in an apparently strained effort,
in portray ing one first-rate villain, and s an dry lessor
lights of the genus —the first-rater contriving to
lead the heroine a life sufficiently miserable to
satisfy the most ardent lover of stage wretched-
nesi. Annie Meadows is (of course) an innocent
country girl, and she throws over an honest
bumpkin admirer, Biddlecomb, in favour of a
London swell mobsman, Richard Kedcb'ffe, on
whose treatment of her and conduct generally turn
the major part of the interest. At one time things
go pleasantly for Annie. Her spouse gets into
“ quod,” and she is taken in hand by a pilanthro-
pist and made a sort of lady help. But Redcliffe
turns up again, as bad boys always do, Annie and
her child are dragged off and made quite too ex-
cessively unhappy, and finally the unfortunate
woman is driven to desperation by her husband's
employment of their little son as an assistant in
the burglary of her benefactor’s banking house.
She frustrates this feature of the programme, and
Redcliffe puts her in a sewer and opens floodgates
admitting the Thames. But the rustic lover of
bygone days arrives in time to save Annie from
drowning, Redcliffe is killed off, and the curtain
falls with the recently created widow happy in the
prospect of eventually being led to the altar by
the previously discarded B.ddlecomb.
♦ * ♦
The chief attractions of ‘ ‘ Alone in
London” are produced by the scenic artist, whose
work is splendidly performed in every detail, and
Mr. George Gordon merits the highest commenda-
tion. None of the characters are artistically
drawn. Tae villain Redcliffe is too utterly void of
any quality other than devilish, and Annie is
weak and meaningless. Miss Agnes Thomas
struggles haid Fto make something out of
Gipsy Tom, a waif and stray of the “Jo” species,
but the part does not allow of any particular
success. 'The Jenkinson of Bland Holt is skilfully
done, and the audience is interested and amused
whenever this funny villain is on the s age Mrs.
Walter Hill, as Biddy Maloney, is suited right
down to the ground, and helps to good purpose to
throw welcome rays of lightintothe dismally shady
pictures of low London life. The drama must
have cost a pretty penny to produce, and should
enjoy a long and profitable run.

A good house, and Joe Davis, who is back
from Newcastle, to look after it, greeted the
fourth representation of “Boccaccio” at the
Sydney Gaiety. W T ith Bill Greeno in a wondrous
suit of black and gold as Leonetto, the opera
beuffe couldn’t fail to be what it was—a success
big enough to make Rev. J. howl with suppressed
gladness Miss Ivanova in the title idle went up
top, her acting being even over the average ability
of prima donna. Thetiio, Lotteringhi. Scalza,
and Lambertuccio (Farley, Dean, and Lester) were
good enough to make us burst a pair of white kids
(our number is 18 in glo ?es, address them to the
office) in frantic applause, and there is enough
whisky in the three to make a sympathetic poet
in the front row hiccough. In fact, the prin-
cipals were too satisfactory to die early. As for
the ladies, they were wonderfully beautiful! They
wear a yard of gold fringe and silktights, and
even then some of them come up to the foot-
lights and complain that there is too much
of their clothes ; but, there wasn’t much his-

At Toulouse menagerie, a ferocious lion
did full justice to his family traditions by tearing
the arm off a poor musician who went too near

artillerymen, who drew their swords and attacked

more ferocious, and he devoured the man's arm
before the eyes of the horror-stricken people.
Several persons fainted away at the ghastly spec-
tacle, and everybody left the menagerie, the in-

lion-tamers arrived, the furious beast was licking
his blood stained jaws and glaring hideously at

A lion plays one of the
leading parts in his new

proving drama, Frayne
had to shoot an apple
off the maiden’s head.
He never failed but
once, and that was once
too many for the girl.
The bullet hit her brain
instead of smashing the
apple. Poor Frayne was
tried and acquitted of
any murderous design on
his own “intended.’’ It
was a sad affair. But if
she had lived to become

the dead from amid the

discovered that, though
the lower boxes had been
burnt away, the topmost
was somehow left intact,
and protruded like a
little square cage from the
wall. In it three ladies
were still s itting. They
had died of suffocation, but were not even
scorched, and the mortal remains sat there side
by side, two leaning back quietly in their chairs,
the third with her fan still in her hand and her
head resting on the ledge in front of her. For
four days they stared down with sightless eyes
before the workmen could reach their lofty perch,
and then they were removed and buried. No one
came to claim them, and their identity was never
discovered,

-Our old friend Luscombe Searelle is play-

hotel in the dead of night—because the accommo-

and the waiters not so attentive as they might be.
After his departure the landlord missed some
blankets from the bedroom Searelle had occupied,
and sent over to Searelle’s new quarters to see
if they had become accidently mixed up with
Searelle’s luggage. The irascible Luscombe
naturally returned to the abode he had abandoned,
called the landlord a mean cad and an adjective
liar, and knocked him down as often as the unfor-
tunate fellow could pick himself up. The magis -
irate who investigated the business said ; “No
doubt there had been a disagreement,” but hfc
commended the gentle Luscombe to show more
control over his temper in the future, and in the
meantime to pay a penalty of £5, which the G.L.
did, together with £1 to the local poor box.

The vanity of old actors is proverbial in
the profession. A benefit performance was to take
place at the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, about
eight or nine years ago. Two old actors, who had
consented to dig themselves out of their long re-

quarrels during the rehearsal of a farce. Both of
them wanted the centre of the stage at every
opportunity, and there was war in consequence.

A strange discovery was recently made
near Cooktown (Q.) On the far J north shore near
the foot of Mount Amos a traveller came across
the remains of a vessel which has apparently lain
there for a century or two. The coast-line has
silted up and left it far above the present high-
water mark, and huge mangroves have grown up
between it and the water. Some old Bristol
galley or Dutch trader evidently visited tho.-e
shores long before Cook was heard of, and left her
bones on the sand, while the crew were probably
killed and eaten, and the men who ate them were
eaten in turn, and those who devoured the second j
lot grew old and withered and became too tough to
be made into a decent lunch years and years before
the white man attempted to colonise Australia.
The worm-eaten wreckage of the old ship alone
remains to tell the tale, and if, on close inspection,
it proves that the spirit of the’ age has breathed
upon what is left of it it should at once be brought
down to Sydney and planned in Parkes’ Charnel
house as a sac'ed relic.

We always feel sorry for the bailiff, the
saddest and worst-banged man in the community.
Nobody loves him, and everybody claws at him
and aims hot water at his head. Those whom the
gods love die young, and so does the bailiff; but
the gods have nothing to do with him—it’s the
other fellow. He gets bald early, for women who
t.re behind with their rent reach for his hair, and
regularly every Monday morning he gets his ear
shifted. Then on Tuesday he generally gets it
shifted back again, and it seldom remains two
(Uys in the same place. Furniture rushes at him
on the smallest provocation ; so do farming imple
ments and live-stock, and cooking utensils fall on
him from a great height. People are always in-
venting new troubles for the bailiff, too, and t his
brings us at last to what we wanted to say all
along. The very latest is that the other day two
of the children of misfortune went to reason with
a farmer who was very deep in debt, and when he
saw them coming he hid himself and left his wife
to talk to them. Accordingly that lady locked the
door and remarked suave’y from the window:
“ Good maimin’ to yez. It’s the master yez want
to see, I don’t doubt now. Well, wait a bit in the
yard, and OiTl sind him to yez." And with that
she went out to the barn and “ shoo’d ” the bull
round the house, and that excited animal came
along with a roar and scattered the bailiffs in the
shadow of a wink.

In addressing the Melbourne Y.M.C.A.
Dr. Goe, who is becoming funnier than any
funeral, urged the young men and women to
follow virtuous and holy lives, such as that of
Lord Cairns, who rose every morning at 4 o’clock
and held communion with God till 6 o’clock before
entering on his legal studies. This dispels our
impression that Lord Gumboil always remained
up till 4 a.m.—at which hour he returned to the
ancestral halls from the Savoy Theatre via the
Gaiery bar and Scot t’s oyster-saloon and Romano’s
restaurant and the Cafd Monico and the Ship
Hotel, and so on. But seriously, when the in-
genuous Goe tells us that old Cairns “ arose every
morning and held communion with God till
(i o’clock before entering on his legal studies,” he
merely tells us that Cairns condescendingly gave
the Deity two hours' start of the Devil. The good
Bishop, however, does not tell ns how it was
that the Almighty was able to spare two hours
every morning to listen to the orisons of a lawyer.

Mr. Forbes-Leith, late President of the
Victorian Field Naturalists’ Club—a body of mild
enthusiasts who go into raptures over the dis-
covery of a rare specimen of potato-bug, and weep
upon each others’ necks when one of their number
triumphantly produces a new variety of yvorm—
has returned from Europe with a Roman lamp
2000 years old which he bought at Malta regard-
less of expense. It gives a light about half as
good as that of a shepherd’s slush-lamp. But then
look at its associations. Horace may have written
his satires by its feeble glow, or Catiline initiated
his friends into the details of his dark conspiracy.
What is far more likely, however, is that some
beady-eyed Maltese living in a cellar manufac-
tured it to beguile the unwary stranger, and that
it was first lit with a tandstickor match struck on
a pair of London-made breeches.

The Hawthorn (Melb.) Inspector of Nuis-
ances is a man of erudition who occasionally
drops into Latin. At such moments the local
Council find it very trying. They didn’t larn no
Latin when they was boys, bless your ’art, but
just had a good plain Henglish heducation which
henabled them to do sums as ain’t too differcult.
An’ when it comes to munney, carn’t they buy up
a dozen of them fine scholards as puts on such
hairs? In course they can. But we must re-
sume. Well, last week the inspector put in his
written report about an absent-minded cow which
wandered within the sacred precincts of a rate-
payer’s garden. The inspector stated that he
was duly summoned to the scene of trouble, but
when he arrived “the cow was non est .” At this
stage of his narrative the classical inspector was
interrupted by a good plain Hinglish councillor,
who wanted to know where the cow was. “ Non
est," whispered another borough magnate, who
had a dim remembrance of seeing the expression
in some book. “ And where was that ?” thundered
plain Hinglish, They put the good man right by
explaining that non est is furrin for “gone away,”
and the cow case was eventually disposed of.
But the inspector ia despised by the Council from
this day for'ard. There's too much of the
scholard about him.

There has been a lot written about Adam
Lindsay Gordon in one way or another lately.
The latest contribution to the literature already
a-cumulated,concerning him appeared in the Mel-
bourne Herald the other day. Here it is
“ The poet’s le<s were so long ihat when astride
some of the colts he could cross them underneath
the animal.” Tnis is one reason, we suppose,
why he had such a good grip on Pegasus. Bat alt
this praise of, and interest in, a man long after
his body has dissolved into gases with hard names
strikes us as being rather late in the evening.
Why not have v, a* med him with them while he
was alive ? Ha, at any rate, would not have
wanted to borrow money from his admirers. Ti e
poet seems to be like the prophet. He is never
thought much of in his own country—or his own
generation, for that matter. A rhyme--
Four hundred and eighty stray dogs —col-
lected in the streets of Melbourne during the last
six months—were drowned by the police the other
day. Stray men generally save the police that
: roub'e. On the whole, it is better to be a stray
dog, in Melbourne, than a stray man, Tire dog is
seldom, it ever, accused of being a burglar
because he has to walk about at night, not having
a place to sleen in, and rarely goes about wanting
to sell his soul (dogs have soul?, or else there is no
future for a lot of people we know) for a pint of
beer. All this happens to a man. Therefore we
say it is better to be a stray dog than a stray man
Even The Bulletin’s reliable penny
c irse is not equal to the occasion at times. On
the banks of the Murray, in the extreme north-
west corner of Victoria, a blackfellow was lately
buried, and above him was placed a monument
consist ing of his tent and blankets, and a quantity
of logs, all hound together with a flshibg-net. The
other day, however, two men, who were white
outside and Chinese within, knocked this tomb to
pieces and “ raised the wind “ by selling the dead
nigger’s tent to a wood-cutter. One of them re-
marked, “ Wot a lark !” and the oth°r said, “Wot
(Pcs a haboriginal want with a tombstone ?” The
man who would turn a deceased native s monu-
ment into beer must have been born in a vat.
A little excitement took place recently in
a Queensland back-blocks township. The local
paper mildly describes it as a disturbance, but
one of the parties concerned, who ran a mile in
3 minutes 30 seconds and wished he had died
young, says it was a mixture of nightmare, Sheol,
blue fire, and blood. A mounted drover began
the trouble ; his hair was standing up with drink,
and he aslrecl a policeman if he thought the
country paid him or any other lantern-jawed
death’s head, all legs, and eyes and meat pies, to
stand scratching his back against a lamp-post. He
also asked him if he wouldn’t like to go down
town and whack a widow or an infant to keep his
hand in, and the officer, feeling that his reputation
for courage was at stake, said, “ What Te ye
givin us?” Then the drover said
and galloped at the policeman, adding that he
would knock him into hashed ass, and the con-
stable cast one wild backward glanca at his aged
mother and his married sister, who lived in the
second house i;ound the corner, and his home.
MORE ADULTERATION.

HAVE BELIEVED IT! ACTUALLY WATERING THE GAS NOW!”
which he never expected to see again, and the dog,
and the steak and qnions which his wife was pre-
paring for supper, and uttering a piercing yell he
skipped for sweet security down* the street.
The drover followed him, using reprehensible
language, and forced him to dodge from side to
side to avoid being run over; another officer loomed
ahead, but seing what was going on he also fled ; a
publican ran beuind the caravan, throwing broken
bottles at the, drover ; the minister’s dog-got in
front, and had all his ribs stove in before he knew
where he was ; and then at last the hunted
policeman found refuge under a corner verandah
and told hi-, enemy he would run him < in. The
drover got off, and, reaching under, hit him in
the ear ; the other policeman bit the drover in
the back while he was doing it and ran away ;
and then the victor got on his horse, and wi h a
wild “ hurroosh” went off at a gailop. Half-an-
hour later he returned, apologised, and shook
hands with the two officers, who hung on to him,
and tried to handcuff him, wbeseupon he hit them
both id the face with his hat and again de-
parted. About 7 o'clock that evening, however,
he appeared for the third lime, and said he had
c me t j surrender and the constabulary pair,
j aided by two trends, made another effort to
j tie him up. At first he was content with telling
; them io stop it, but when they still persisted he
raked their legs from under tnem with his foot,
and had some supper and allowed himself to be
locked in a cell. Ic is understood that at his
trial the first policeman, if his ear is sufficiently
recovered, will testify that he fought with the
prisoner for three hours, and ultimately succeeded
in wrenching from him two revolvers and a spiked
club, after which he took him “ into cushtody,
yer Honner,” in spite of his struggles.

bers who arose and walked out of the Victorian
Parliamentary gallery while Gaunson was abusing
Windeyer didn’t leave because they specially re-
spected the smiling Judge. They left out of sheer
envy of Gaunson’s slanging powers.
A bill for the protection of game is under
the consideration of the Indian vice regal council.
Tnousands of unarmed peasants are annually
killed by wild beasts, yet the preservation of game
la considered much more important in order to
provide sport for the milingtary rulers of India.
The Age, speaking of the Argus, says :
‘ An unbroken series of precedents demoaa' rat- s
that no cause to which that pap r gives its -pp si-
tion ever fails to succeed.” It might have added
tdat everything which the Argus supports is
eventually blown down by the honest breath of
po.ular opinion.
The Irish are keen lawyers. Their benevo-
lent rulers having given them a brand-new Coer-
cion Act, they have ungratefully gone and killed
its chief clause by turning the National League
into a trades’ union. The Tories have got to do
their work over again and make an act to stamp
out trades’ unionism.
Mr. Nimmo, Victorian Minister of Public
Works, mildly suggests a means of relief for the
decrepit and unfortunate. He advocates the
Scotch system of a tux rn heritors and landowners
which enables any homeless wr«tch to demand
“ proper assistance and relief from his native
parisn. Bravo. Nimmo ! the co>d waierhe
swears by hasn’t chilled his heart or muddied his
faculties.
Of the ■personnel of tho Victorian Ministry.
Gillies looks cool and juicy ; Deakin seems to ha
on wires : Dow puzzled and awfully busy ; Dur-
ham looks just out of a band-box ; Wrixou, re-
served, amiable, and full'of “possibility of com-
pliance.” Any artist wno wants to catch the ex-
pression of absolute negativeness had better watch
the faces of a deputation whichhadjust “ thanked

’Viable Enery, Champion Egotist, after
jerking out 1713 ‘‘ls" in his Molong speech,
modestly concluded: “If the Government be
spared we shall endeavour to direct the policy of
the country in the guidi> g light, and to the great
ends/have indicated to you this evening.” We
are much obliged to Henry for this remote hint
that there are one or two other people besides
himself in the N.S. W. Ministry.
“Why do the authorities allow our Chinese
quarter to remain in the condition in which it is
admitted to be?” asks the Melbourne Hbrald.
Well, we guess it’s because the lands and tene-

The Russian bear has invaded Victoria
The animal was brought over by a couple of

The petty German “ Royalties ” at the
English Court are “ displeased” because the
dusky Queen of the Sandwich Islands has hem
recognised by her Gracious as a sister Sovereign.
Hence this thusnesa. She now “takes precr-
dence ” of the petty Serene Transparencies of
Lagers will von Hamme-bung, Schwillensau'en-
schewedischturnipstein, Rutterbrod von Schnaop-

The English Admiralty officials take the
cake for stupidity. Several war >hips were fitting
at Newcastle on Tyne, and hundreds of tons of
coal were dragged by train from Cardiff to New-
castle to fill their bunkers ! Another man o’-war
was fitting in the Forth of Clyde, within sight, of
a steam colliery, and the inspired idiots at White-
hall actually sent coal from Cardiff to put on
board her. Thus we see that even our heaven
born administrators can learn a bit about “how
not to do it” from the old folks at home
The London Daily News has boldly de-
clared that, by the proclamation of nearly all
Ireland under the Crimes Act, a gross on rage has
been committed on that country. Comm-mtii g
on this, the Argus says : “ The above express! n
of opinion by the Daily News possesses no sig j
niflcance, as that paper is an organ of the Glad-
stone-Parnell party.' What cool impudence!
When the Argus correspondent cables over halt
a column of lies from the Times, the public is
never warned that the landowners' organ is
merely perjuring itself in tne interests of the
Salisbury-Hartington clique.
Exports from the U.S. during the first
three months of this year increased by £5,600,000,
and the imports by £1,934 000. In England, as
compared with the same period in 1886, during the
first four months the exports increase-! by only
£1,952 949, and the imports by £10,622,472, In
April the imports to Great Britain show an in-
crease of £5.083,171. while the exports decreased
slightly as compared with the previous year. If
Great Britain continues to go to the bad like this,
she will have to send for Pulsford to prove that
Freetrade is a gladsome and a glorious policy.
The other day there was a vacancy in a
N.S.W. Southern Police magistracy, and one of
the most capable officers in the colony with an
unblemished rec ud and 47 years’ experience was
aopointed to fill it. A rew mouths previously he
had been removed from a former appo ntment
where he had with his family made an effort at
settling down for the remaind: if his life. No
sooner, however, had he been installed in his last
office than he was again removed to make way
for a favourite of the department, a much younger
man with an official existence of only 14 years.

The London police-magistrates have been
much worried of late by Tottie Smith. Tottie is
aged 19, and is a sparkling beauty, but she turns
up once a week among the drunks attired in a
bodice and striped petticoat, with a bustle tied
conspicuously outside. Also she has no boots or
stockings. She winks at the gaoler, and tells the
magistrate she would like to adopt him ; and oc-
casionally she appears carrying a pair of corse r a
under her arm. When last heard of she said that
if she were only let off this time she wou'd leave
the country, from which we presume some benevo-
lent society is going to export. Tottie t" Australia.

Rev. John Husking, a Melbourne Metho-
dist parson, is growing downright hungry in the
service of the Loard. The flock has left off giving
John any salary, on the ground that he
refuses to support the doctrine of a material hell.
At latest dates the Rev. John—reduced to six
stone nothing, preaching weight—was sending
round the colßcdon-plate in behalf of his own
Sunday dinner’s fund. Poor preacher he repre-
sent,ed to his flock that ‘if a man preached the
00-pel he had a right to be paid for it.” That’s
true. The itinerant organ-grinder has a right to

Sh u!d woman-suffrage ever be granted
here, there is one man who will wish he had a
flour-mill tied round his neck and were buried in
the deep blue sea. That man is our “Answer to
Correspondents” artist. Already one fair enthu-
siast has sent along enough pink paper for a
circus-poster, and if we read her cockatoo fence
sryle of writing correctly, she wants us t o “ tell
her all about ‘ Protection,’ and ‘ Home Rule,’ and
the ‘Land Bill,’ and ‘ P.-yment of Memb-rs'’ and
what are the real duties of an Ad Val'rem.”
That’s about all she wants to hear of this trip, blit
she cautions us to “ explain these subjects fully
and in language easily understood by a new be-
ginner of Political Economy." Simply that and
nothing more! Why our fair friend omitted to
ask for the usual recipe for removing freckles
and a tasty way of dishing up cold mutton is a
greater mystery than the Bermagui trouble’ but
we are very certain that the men who advocate
woman-suffrage after this notice will never die in
their beds while we can wield a meat-axe and
get within cooey of them.
Parkes fa developing his ideas on the com-
ing female elector. He is “sure that no woman
would even vote for a man who got drunk, or a
man who was unkind to children, or one who was
cruel, or one who did not give his attention to
the treatment of destitute and orphan children.’
Quite so. No one need expect a vote from Si
Enry’s female reformer unless he wears a blue
ribbon, wheels the baby-carriage at least one hour
per day, is a member of the Society for Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals, and takes an absorb
mg interest in Lady Carington’s Queen’s Fund
Sir Enry’s emphasises the fact that the lady voter
should go to the ballot-box just in the “ same way
as she went to the market to purchase, say a
pound of sausages.” We were not aware that
anybody contemplated her going to the ballot-box
on roller-skates, or in the slight garb of a Papuan
princess. But Parkes is a poet, and we must let
him down gently—as usual.

At dinner time one day last week, at
Sydney School of Arts, an assistant was placed at
the head of the stairs, and as people came up they
were asked to state their numbers on the sub-
scriber’s list. Those without any tumbled down
stairs by the dozen. The bona-fide subscribers
grinned, and actually had a chance to read the
periodicals; The Secretary has not interfered in
this matter a moment too soon.

A Sydney clergyman inveighed the other
Sunday from the pulpit against the reading of
novels of the London Journal order. “ A young
married woman,” he said, “is not filled with
extra love for her poor devil of a husband, who
perchance has just come home from the Govern-
ment relief works, if she has been spending her
hours in the company of dukes, earls, and mar-
chionesses.”

At the bank at which Queen Victoria’s
private account is kept a strict rule prevails that
it shall only be open to the inspection of the clerks
immediately engaged in connection with it, and
the penalty imposed on any other employe who
may venture to view the ledger is instant dis-
missal. A young fellow who was appointed to a
position in the establishment, and who was sent
into a room where the ledger containing the debit
and credit account of her Majesty was kept, in-
fluenced by an unlucky curiosity, was induced to
open and view it. He was seen by a brother
clerk, who reported the incidents, and the re-
sult was that the unfortunate delinquent was
immediately cashiered, notwithstanding that
he pleaded that he was quite unaware of the con-
tents of the book when he had seen it.

Two members of the Queensland revenue
police entered the Clermont Club one evening re-

Good luck seems to attend the name of
Hennessy. A Reverend father of light, James
Hennessy, has been presented 65 sovereigns on
leaving Gundagai for another vineyard, and the
congregation burst into sobs during the ceremony.
We can easily understand this—for who would not
sob on parting with James Hennessy ? It is but
fair, however, to his reverence to state that he
seems to have made his little purse out of the
anti-Cognac movement.

In a western Queensland township, the
other day, the junior partner of a local firm rushed
into the editorial sanctum, and, seeing that the
great man was not in, looked up the only composi-
tor on the premises and told him that his senior
partner’s wife had just given birth to a “big,
bouncing boy,” and not to forget to publish a
notice of the event. The informant was in a
hurry and had no time to write down the particu-
lars. The comp, was also in a hurry with his
work and a large quid of tobbacco, but neverthe-
less he promised to see to it. When the customer
had gone some time the comp, recollected that a
birth announcement had to he made; and having
been a little absent-minded he was puzzled which
of the partners should be credited with the baby.
Reasoning from the hurried appearance of his
visitor, he concluded the baby was born unto
the junior partner, to whom he therefore gave the
benefit of the doubt. When that junior partner
saw the birth announcement in his name he went
straight to the office with an eight-pound axe.

A powerful limelight was thrown on the
duties of a lady companion at North Shore
(Sydney) police court the other day. A young
lady (‘-of prepossessing appearance”) was sum-
moned for deserting her hired service. This
charming creature was engaged at £3O per annum
as a “lady companion,” and her duties consisted
(she found this out afterwards) of feeding, bath-
ing, and dressing the kids, making beds and
assisting in the kitchen, with the compensating
privilege of dining with the family and sitting in
the “ droring-room ” any evening she got finished
in time, which must have been pretty seldom if
she performed her duties faithfully, bhe is now
thinking of hiring out as a general servant. No
more gentility for her,

One of the largest American tobacco-
manufacturers says that when a cigar-maker
desires to do his employer lastn g damage, he goes
to work on the Dest leaf, and puts a single hair
out of his head in each cigar. This trick is almost
impossible to detect, and yet it will destroy the
flavour of every c>gar it is applied to, and in
time irretrievably ruin the best brands. The only
remedy is to employ none but bald-headed rollers.
At the banquet given to Sir Henry Parkes
at Parkes, the town of which he is godfather, a
rugged local maghate said—As a compliment, if
you please ! - that Sir Henry and the town much
resembled each other, in that they “both had
risen from nothing.” Now we come to think over
the matter, there is yet another resemblance.
Neither of the pair is anything much to “blow”
about, eVen now.

The London correspondent of Adelaide’s

Mr. Phil, Robinson, late editor of the Court and

A jilted young man at Drey’s Plain (Vic.),
drank himself to death to assuage his sorrows.
His girl was so overcome by remorse that she
killed herself with strychnine. The swain was a
fool and so was she. We are sorry for her death :
the poor little woman was too innocent and
artless to know, and to console herself by the re-
flection, that had he suicided decently with
strjchnine and left a note for the coroner saying
that some girl had jibed hem, scores and scores of
women would have goj o about laying the flatter-
ing und ion to their souls that one man at least
had died for the love of them When the time comes
for us to swallow five grains of the deadly alka-
loid and die we Will scribble on a piece of paper :
“I die for the sake of the woman whom I love,”
and then, after dissolving the drug, we will stir it
into a small bottle of bitter beer and drink the
draught, well knowing that when the news gels
into the papers a lot of those whom we have loved
will be too knowing to come round and tearfully
gaze for the last time upon our poor clay— they
will be frightened of meeting all the other girls.
And then a lot of the little simpletons who don’t
believe that wo ever had any other girls—all
they will do will be to each complacently remark ;
“ Dear me I Poor fellow, I never did think he
was finite right He was always a little strange
in his manner, but I did not anticipate he would
end himself—how dreadful ?—for my sake.” And

one corner of the Venetian blind to see bow many

With commendable thoughtfulness, the
Australian Gaslight Company has furnished each
of its patrons with a highly moral circular contain-
ing enough excellent advice to make their heads
ache for a jear. The first item on the list tells us
to “ turn on the meter-tap full for cooking,” and
the last contains the solemn and' much-needed
warning, “ Do not grumble at the amount of your
gas-bills.” Having unfortunately given our own
circular away in mistake for a £5 note to a blind
man round the corner, we have to trust to our
memory for the rest of the admirable hints given,
but we fancy the following fill the programme
correctly:—“Remember that the instrument can’t
lie. Never turn the meter off under any considera-
tion, as this is detrimental to dividends, and tak-
ing a mean advantage of a guileless company
whose directors lie awake half the night devising
plans for your own welfare and comfort. If your
meter leaks, let it leak, and be thankful you can
afford to keep a meter of any kind whatever. This
will save the plumbers’ bills, and make the Gas
Co. love you. Remember, that summer nights
are short, and those of winter long—but, owing
to a merciful dispensation of Providence, the gas-
meter keeps up to its top average all through.
Pay your gas-bills punctually, aid, if necessary,
two or three times over; remember the Lord
loveth a cheerful giver, and bis dat qui cito dat —
he gives twice who pays double. Never speak
disrespectfully of the Gas Co., for it burns to
you, and to lighten your darkness —and
pockets also. Keep your lamps trimmed and
your gas turned full on night and day. Remember
the parable of the foolish virgins who cut off their
gas, and when the bridegroom came they were
booted out, like dead rats, from the festiv e board
because they didn't know enough to keep them-
selves warm. Lastly, burn all the gas you can,
and pay for as much more, if possible, and when
the collector calls look upon him as an angel of
sweetness and light. P.S. —This is a goak.

A woman —we beg her pardon, a lady—

Feeling a strong craving to behold Sydney
culchaw balancing on two pairs of wheels and
a sickly grin, we stowed ourselves into a hansom
and made for the Columbia Skating Rink last
Thursday night. When we got there a band was
complaining about something in the key of G
sharp and some people were falling down and
trying to look as if they liked it, on skates. Cer-
tainly rinking is the very poetry of motion when
you can do it, but then
so very few can, doncher-
know, and the spectacle
of a fascinating girl with
a seductive ankle taking
a header on to the waxy
floor, and in so doing
tripping up her escort,
who also conies a big
cropper, followed by the
old gentleman behind who
doesn’t look where he’s
going and falls over the
pair in his turn, might
amuse some people, but
not us. When Skinner
himself floats round,
though, with a dreamy
expression and two inches
of dudeish shirt-cuff (not
to mention his heavenly
mustivey) the married
men look fierce at their
flirty spouses and tell
them that this is “no
place for them, d’ye

Now that the Bras-
seys have departed we
feel charitably disposed
towards them, and in-
clined to remember a
yarn greatly to the credit
of Lord Tommy’s papa,
which runs just like
this. In the dawn of life
Lord B'spapawas a young
man with lots of energy—
a good character and (it
follows) no cash. He
was in the emoloy of a
Chester banker, Mr. Wardell. Being (like his
sons wife) of a pushing turn of mind ho saw his
way to enter on small contracts. At last he was
offered a very large railway contract far beyond
his means. In his extremity he waited on his old
boss, laid the facts ef the case before him, and
asked him for a large advance “But,” he con-
cluded, “ I have no security to offer you.” “ Yes
you have—the best a good character. You
shall have the money.” (Mr. Wardell lived before
the days of defaulting clergymen.) Now comes
the poetry of the affair. Years after, when Brassey
was a second Croerus, a rumour got about that
Warden’s bank was shaky. Brassey heard of it
and sped to Chester. “ I have just heard the bad
news. What sum do you require?” Several
hundreds of thousands was the hopeless amount.
“ You shall have it,” “ But I have no security at
all! ” “ Yes you have—the best—a good charac-
ter.” Toe bank was saved, and years after, as
embezzling accountants prayerfully skipped to
Honolulu they blessed the saving name of B assey
proportionately to the size of their appropriations.

The letter of Prince Albert the Good to

a blessing before he could go on with the ceremony
and who was going to regard it as his future safe-
guard and joy, must have be-n very much in love

Writes a correspondent :
“ Adelaide has been overwhelmed with excitement over
the appearance of the ‘ N.S.W. Contingent.’ First to come
was Sydney's Jubilee Mayor, Alban Riley, who was enter-
tained by Mayor E. T. Smith. It would be difficult indeed
to decide which of the two paid the more ‘jammy ’ compli-
ments to the other. We awarded a ‘ dead heat,' but it was a
close contest, and they both seemed intensely relieved when
they had finished their speeches. Lord Catiogton (the Ade-
laide papers will spell the name with two ‘ is’), accompanied
by Ministers Abigail. Clarke, and Barns, were next received.
H K. exhausted his somewhat limited vocabulary in re-
ferring to S.A.’b musical Governor, Wobinson, and the
said Wobinson did likewise in regard to Smith, but
they both survive. Fair Adelaide’s ladies think Lord
Caringtou extremely good-looking, but his feet—oh ! !
Lord Bertie, we believe, mashed successfully. Habigail has
been giving Adelaide people a specimen of his oraton-. I i
response to the toast of ‘N.S.W.’ the Minister for Mines
said, without a smile, that ‘Adelaide was honoured by the
flower of the N.S.W. Parliament, and many distinguished
people, and he felt some diffidence in the presence of so
much N.S.W. eloquence’ How’s that for high? S- eaking
of Habigail, we hear that one Adelaide Bulletin reader
had actually the effrontery to call on him at his hotel and
ask if tie had yet settled the oft-rendered account of that
paper for £25 The result of the interview is not chronicled.
Ministers Clarke and Burns have each had I heir innings at
talking—rubbish, and no doubt the whole party will have a
lot more to say on their return to Sydney. Bx-Attorney-
Geueral Jack Want and T. Walker, M.L A., are the more
recent arrivals in pious Adelaide. It is worthy of note that
no remark was made by any one of these personages respect-
ing the loyalty of the citizens of Sydney, and ‘ the enthusi-
astic meeting ’ which was held. One would have expected a
lot of snuffle on this head.”

bounding billow, calling out frantically for the
stewardess. Shortly after they arrived in Mel-
bourne she quarrelled with her Lothario, Tna
cause of the quarrel has not been divulged. Per-
haps he was a little too premature in giving him-
self airs ; perhaps she discovered in time that his
morals were not as good as she thought they
were. Anyhow, she left him hastily one day, and
took refuge with her grandmamma. It was a
bit of bad luck for him, as she had drawn—so it
is said—£7 000 out of the bank only a day or two
before. He might, with some economy, have
lived several months on this before he found out
that there was an incompat bility of tempera-
ment between them. There are several morals to
be drawn from this story. One—for men only—
is that when a man runs away with a
rich girl he should ba careful how he
offends her before she has entrusted him with
the cash. Another—for parents—is that they
should never allow their daughters to be taught
by a male musician, no matter how old or how
ugly ha may be. Hands are apt to meet a great
deal too ran ?h in fingering tae keys of a piano.
We once knew an old musician—he was over 70
years of age—with wamry eyes, and a red nose,
who could —and did —cause young and handsome
girls to follow him as the rats did the Pied Piper
of Himelin. Yet gazed at with the masculine
eye he was as feeble and frowsy-looking a crea*
ture as you would wish not to meet. You had to
take a drink after talking to him in order to get
the taste out of your mouth. But, notwithstand-
ing, there was some diabolical charm about him
which made the hearts of women as wax in his
hands A piano under the spell of a master is the
finest of love-makers. We would not like to say
as much for a trombone. Yet another moral for
girls is—that they should not leave their happy
homes to fly to far lands with long-haired Or-
pheuses before they have mado sure that the
Orpheuses are virtuous. It might be better still
if they (the girls) were not to run away with
musicians at all. Why not choose journalists ?.
They are disinterested and care nothing for money
—except a little now and then for ram. Besides
their morals are above suspicion. Let ua remark,
before we are misunderstood, that this is a general
statement, and does hot apply to ns (except as far
as the purity of morals goes) personally. Any
girl coming to this office wanting us to fly with
her will not ba asked to sit down. We have been
flown with, as much as we think "good for our-
selves already. By the way, the musician who
flew the other day is slid to have left bahind him
a practice worth £lOOO a year. We shall not be
surprised to hear of him next as the orchestra in a
freak-of-aature show, nor to hear of the proprietor
of same coming forward one evening and address-
ing the audience something after this fashion :
“ Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to say that in
consequence of the orchestra having abducted the
Fat Lady there will be no show this evening.”
Let that Fat Lady take warning in time. The
heroine of this little story is now living in retire-
ment practising variations on Watts' hymns.

Touching that blasphemous Jubilee ser-
vice at Westminster, it is stated that “ most of

A fat Chinese last week performed on

despatch i.e., he, instead of cutting his throat
(which according to the most celebrated physiolo-
gists is a painless operation) slashed open his

Which recalls the fact that a most sensational
abdominal section was performed the other day by
one of the honorary surgeons of Sydney hospital.
The patient was a man, and made a splendid
recovery.
There is, in Coonamble, a policeman who

CORRESPONDENCE
Tn« Bulletin will return all unsuitable MSS. when the
address is specified and stamps are enclosed. But we desire
those sending MSS. to distinctly understand that we are not
responsible for the preservation or transmission of such
MSS.
“ H.W.” : We don't think much of Mr. Henry
as a bard....” H.W.M.” : You have proved that a ring can
be square. You have squared the circle, in fact. All right,
go and talk into the ear of poor old Euclid “ S.L.E.”
suggests “Longbeeria” as a new name for N.S. Wales
"Vic.” (Narrabri); Very acceptable. ... -l S.D." : Very well
done. But the question of a decimal system of coinage is
not just now a burning one. The burning question—the
“boss" burning question—is how to obtain coin of the sort
now used... .“C.S.E.” : You might just as well ask how it is
that Mrs. Langworthy was enabled to find under the laws of
the Argentine Republic an instant justice denied her by
British courts....“ Bargo " : The tyrant Merzentius had a
pleasant little trick of fastening a living prisoner to a dead
one, so that the former would be killed by the gradual
corruption of the latter. Persons who, like yourself,
believe in keeping a virtuous wife chained for life
to a drunken, brutal husband seem to be able to
improve even on the fiendish cruelty of Merzentius,.,,
“ E. Bulkeley”: How do you reconcile your contentions
with the fact that the Irish poor are evicted “ in the Queen's
name?’".O.A.” (The Hsart, Gippsland): Please write
to the Secretary, Mr. W. M. Foote, who will forward you
prospectuses, &c,*.." E.L.G.”; As Governor Loch is so
stingy, why doesn't the Australian Natives’ Association,
which makes such a splutter about people being born in
Australia, offer a prize of their own to the mother of
triplets? This is the manner in which great nations are
built up —3*' E. Bernstein” ; Parkes has broken his pro-
mises, has he ? Never mind, he can make plenty new ones.
”B. Masson”: We hardly think that Premier
Gillies will this time have the conscience to make himself
disagreeable over the proposed Parliamentary grant of
£lOOO to the widow and family of Marcus Clarke, consider-
ing that for the somewhat needy family of Australia’s first
litterateur Mr. Reid, M.L.A.. asks only half as much as was
required to meet the expenses of Gillies’ pleasure trip—
charged to the revenue “ Ooorong ” ; Many thanks. Go
ahead "L.L.S."; The latest theory about the Ber-
magui mystery is that Mr. Young and party were poisoned
and their bodies taken out to sea in a boat (which as it was
found bow-on to the rocks could not have drifted ashore.)
The holes in it, which were made from the inside outwards,
could not have been the result of accident. It is altogether
unlikely that one murderer would undertake the risk of
shooting four men —“ W. Semple”; There are some
manias just as bad as alcoholism or morphia-eating, aud one
of them is the desire for politico,! distinction on the part of
men whom nature and education have unfitted for anything
better than calling their neighbour a liar in the Legislative
Assembly or plotting against him behind the carefully-
" tyled” doors of some miserable se"ret society ‘ R.B.’
(Oooma): The butcher has seized our encyclopedia and our
memory man is down with brain fever ; we can’t tell you
....‘ Thomas’ (Albnry): The S.M. Hbbald simply makes

reader for proof ; manufactures in America could not have
been established and brought to inch a high state of perfec-
tion within so short a period without Protection. More

1 society, 1 and if the people of Powong consider their affairs
of more importance—to themselves—than the Queen’s

things are relative ~‘J.A.H,’; Will examine. Wi-
lliam Nelson’ (Tilpa, Vic,): Next week, perhaps
‘ W.B.M.’: 1 A Surprise for the Premier,’ you leave off before
you get to the ‘sur,rise’; will consider the other ‘screed’
you send us. Nimrod 1 (Vic.): Thanks ‘ J. H. Parker’

attend ‘W. G. Taylor ’; We are not quite clear about the
‘ Football Polka ’; is it to (be performed as a pedal exercise,
or is lingering’ permissible? ‘ J.S.’ (Gundagai): ‘Bung’
is aboriginal for ‘dead,’ hence if the joint stock company to
which yon refer has gone ‘bung,’ you can look for its re-
mains in the local boneyard ‘Bushy’ (Mount Mac-
donald): Your letter was somehow mislaid; propound
your query again and we will endeavour to satisfy you..
‘ W.H.B’ (Brisbane): The metre of you ‘pome’ is all out of

than any other quality....‘G J.T ’ (Randwick): Thanks.

Jay Gould, who has obtained a railway and
telegraphic monopoly in China, aud has started a
huge bank at Shanghai, fancies that he has now
complete financial control of the Chinese Empire.
J. G. has evidently never been in court during

A wedding of some interest to Sydney
folks took place on June 4tb, at Bt. Augustine’s,
Queen’s Gate, London, when “Miss Helena Chad-
wick, daughter of Mr. R. Chadwick, of fUgecliffe
Road, Sydney, who, with Mrs. Chadwick, is at
present on a trip to Europe, was married to Cap-
tain George Osborn, R. A., adjutant of the South
Durham Artillery Volunteers.
Mr. De Lisle, M.P., for promising to
break whose neck Mr. Healy was, according to a
late cable, suspended from attendance ,at the
Commons, is a prominent member of the most ex-
treme branch of the Conservative party. In
other words, Mr. De Lisle is a fashionable English
Homan Catholic Tory.
There was a somewhat crowded attendance
at the second last dance given by the ladies of the
Hand wick Assembly at Nithsdale on Thursday
last, but not sufficiently so to mar the comfort of
the dancers. Among the pretty costumes was
that worn by a daughter of the hostess, who looked
charming in pale pink ottoman silk. Her married
sister wore cream silk trimmed with beautiful
lace. The fiancee of a young lancer looked pretty
in white tulle relieved with brown.
The arrival in Sydney from Adelaide of
H. Lord Carington, last Friday, was the cause
of some little disappointment to his staff. They
gathered expectantly on the railway platform and
gazed into the carriages of the 11 a.m. train, but
failed to find him. However, he turned up at
I. p.m. and explained thst he had been stuck
up by a deputation or some other awful boah at
Goulburn, doncherknow. Captain Baynes met him
with a guard of honour, which included the in-
evitable Lancers.
Lady Carington, accompanied by her
daughters, Lord Shaftesbury, and Major Gas
coigne, visited the Mint on July 27, probably to
procure some Jubilee coins to place in the founda-
tion-stone of a Mission House on Edgecliffe Road,
which she laid on Saturday latt.
The Australian Club ball, on the 29fch ult.,
passed off pleasantly. New and stylish dresses
were the exception. Lady Carington wore a
pale blue costume and diamonds ; Mrs. C. Hogg,
an exceedingly pretty dress of pale green net and
satin, with dark green striped velvet and satin
bodice and panels, pink feathers and ribbons;
Mrs. H. M'Quade, a very stylish black satin and
tulle dress, bodice cut V shape back and front;
MDs Metcalfe, a lovely white satin and net
frock ; Mrs. W. Mitchell, a becoming heliotrope
gown ; and Mrs. W ise, pale pink crepe de chine.

INSOMNIA.
One of the chief maladies of the age is Insomnia,
and from this terrible nerve disturbance spring
the most painful and hopeless diseases. “If I
sleep to-night I will spend to-morrow (Sunday)
morning with you. If you don’t see me you will
know what is the matter." Such notes as these
were quite frequently received by the writer from
an old friend, one of the most brilliant men of his
time. He was an indefatigable business man, and
always on the top wave of prosperity. His
success he attributed to his untiring industry.
This man was undoubtedly correct No depart-
ment of his vase interests was ever neglected, and
with all this labor he managed to keep abreast of
his time in all scientific and literary matters. But
for years he was not able to sleep, and, strange to
relate, with all his intelligence, this fact was
utterly inexplicable to him. He disregarded all
warnings, laughed at the predictions of the wise,
and grew weasel' and more irritable as the days
rolled by. This gentlemrn had not a single bad
habit. He never touched sprituous liquors, nor
did he use tobacco in any form. His only excesses
were intellectual excesses. His arch enemy was
ambition, and it wrecked him quite as thoroughly
and tragically as intemperance in a less refined
form might have done. Sleep is nature's great
restorer, without it insanity and death ensue, lo
the weary brain to which sleep is a stranger,
breaking down,under the pressure of business, or
stress of househo'd cares, we offer with entire con-
fidence a brain tonic and restorer tried and found
reliable in three continents, which is both harmless
and effec f ive. It contains no opium, cocoaine, or
other harmful drug to create a morbid appetite,
and leave its victim infinitely worse than before,
rendering him totally unfit for business or pleasure 1 ;,
and morally and spiritually blasted, but is com*
posed of ingredients harmless as water, and sooth-
ing and beneficial in its effects. Such a remedy is
Warner’s Safe Nervine, now put on the Austra-
lasian market for the first time, although wellj
known in England, the United States, and Canada.
It is for sale in two sizes, at 2s 6d, and ss. per
bottle, the os. size holding 18 ounces, the same as
Warner’s safe cure. “Through the avenue of
insomnia a man is pretty sure to travel one of
three houses,” Charles Lamb once told a friend,
“to the mad house, the poor house, or the house
of refuge. If he passes these he will bring up at a
hospital, public or private, and this place, to my
mind, is almos't as bad as the others.” This was
the conclusion of the brilliant “ Elia,” and it is
none the less true to-day. If you find you are not
sleeping well you are in danger. It is a danger
not to be trifled with. Avoid it at once by pur-
suing the path we have pointed out, and secure
that blessed boon—Sleep, that
“ Barrier ’twlxt day and day,
Mother of fresh thoughts and joyous health."
The eminent Eastern traveller and writer,
Madame Dieulafoy, has made herself more
“eminent” still by appearing in a Paris theatre
on a fashionable “first night” performance
attired in men’s evening dress—trousers and a
dress coat, open pointed waistcoat, white tie,
short hair, &c.

Harden cel liver.
Five years ago I broke down with kidney and
liver complaint and rheumatism.
Since then I have been unable to be about at all.
My liver became hard like wood ; my limbs were
puffed up and filled with water.
All the best physicians agreed that nothing
could cure me. I resolved to try Hop Bitters ; I
have used seven bottles ; the hardness has all gone
from my liver, the swelling from my limbs, and it
has ivorked a miracle in my case; otherwise I
would have been now in my grave.

Poverty and Sntlcring.
" I was dragged down with d«bt.povert,y and miffe log for
years, caused by a sick family and large bills for doctoring.
I was completely discouraged, until one year ago, by the
advice of my pastor, I commenced using Hop Bitters, and in
one month we were all well, and none of us have seen a sick
day since, and I want to say to all poor men, you can keep
your f imilies well a year with Hop Bitters for less than one
doctor’s visit will cost. I know it."

and if he has taken your money for anything else indict him

ETTER THAN PHYSIC.
Owing to the unprecedented success which has
attended the sale and use of Dr. Scott’s Electric
Brushes in Europe, America, and Australia, as
shown by the accumulated mass of unsought testi-
mony to their value, we are now in a position to
offer them to the public at the prices named ;
No. 1 Hair Brush Is. 6d.
~ 2 do .. ... Cs. Od.
~ 3 do Bs. 6d.
~ 4 do 10s. 6d.
„ 5 do 12s. 6d.
Flesh Brush 12s. 6d.
Bath Brush 17s. Cd.
Tooth Brush 2s. Od.
These brushes are all made of pure 1 ristles, not
w re; the brush handle is made of a new odorless
composition resembling ebony, a combination of
substances producinga permanent electro magnetic
current, which acts immediately, and the strength
of which can be tested at any time by a small com-
pass s applied with each brush,
The hair brushes will positively cure nervous or
bilious headache in five minutes, neutralise th e
distressing agony of neuralgia, prevent falling
hair and baldness, dandruff, and diseases of the
scalp. I hey will make the hair grow long and
glossy, arrest premature greyness, and soothe the
weary brain.
The flesh-brush is said, by the Surgical
Gazette, to be “ better than all liniments and
embrocations.” It keeps the skin healthy, beauti-
fies the complexion, and imparts vigor and energy
to the whole body.
The bath-bni'h is one of those comforting de-
velopments of modern science, the value of which
can only be appreciated by using it. It speedily
cures all pains and aches resulting from colds,
impure blood, and impaired circulai ion.
The Royal Dental Society of London testify in
the strongest terms as to the great benefits which
speedily follow the use of Dr. Scott’s Electric
Tooth Brush, and many experts in dentistry de-
clare it to be the greatest invention in dental ap-
pliances since the manufacture of artificial teeth.
Any or all of these brushes are handsome toilet
accessories, and \ory durable.
If you cannot purchase them in your immediate
neighbirhood we will send by post to any part of
New South Wales, on receipt of price named, with
6d. added for postage.

Dr. Tanner, M.P., of the Irish party, is
the terror of the Tories. While Pinafore Smith
was in the middle of a maundering Jubilee speech
lately, Tanner jumped up suddenly, and asked
whether the Government had engaged the Poet
Laureate to compose a Jubilee ode on Coercion.
Ireland seems to be a land where the
heart-rending and the ludicrous are inextricably
interwoven. At the Bodyke evictions the fortified
cabins of John Lyddy and the Widow MacNamara
were captured after a whole day’s siege, in which
200 police and 100 soldiers formed the attacking
force. As soon as the army retired, both families
re-took possession. “Force is no remedy.”

The Victorian Supreme Court judges have
asked the Melbourne Corporation to pave the
roads about the new Law Courts with wood, and
also to preserve the neighbourhood from the dull
fumble of tramways. The Aegus says that tan
should be laid round the court buildings. Wonder
how would Higinbotham, C.J., and his five J.’s
like to sit in the Sydney Supreme Court with the
eternal roar and pant of the Government trams
going on outside the door ? The Argus is sur-
prised that j udges’ears should be so abnormally
sensitive. There was a justice of the Common
Pleas in Ireland who couldn’t deliver a judgment
in comfort if an ass brayed outside, and was
unable to pass sentence of death if wedding bells
rang out from a neighbouring church. Mr. Justice
Ball on one occasion while presiding in an assize
town sent out a policeman to have a marriage-
bell silenced at a church hard-by. The constable
succeeded in having “ th’ ordher o’ th’ coort ”
obeyed, but got a severe scalp wound from an old
boot which had been meant for the bride. When
he returned into court he dropped his baton on the
floor amid a dead silence, and was summoned
before His Lordship and severely rebuked. No
sooner had order been again restored than a defiant
donkey outside, for the larceny of which a
prisoner was awaiting his trial, began to bray like
mad. This was too much for old Ball, who said
he’d fine the sheriff if the court was further dis-
turbed. A constable then rushed out of court and
induced the donkey by a bribe of carrots and
thistles to “ howld his jaw.”
In Queensanld, on a recent hot day, a
coach rolled peacefully along a rough bush track.
All was calm and still, and no sound broke the
solemn silence except the creaking of the un-
greased wheels, and the occasional croak of the
thingumbob and the thrill whistle of some tropical
fowl whose name is too long for our space. Then
suddenly a huge snake was observed sleeping
right in the track and the wheel went over it. It
was killed, but in its death agonies it fixed its
fangs in the vehicle, and in less than a quarter of
an hour the coach swelled to such a frightful ex-
tent that it got jammed and had to be left behind.
Mr. Alfred Bennett is now requested to oblige the

John Norton, the N.S. W. labour agitator
is a journalist by profession, his first essay on the
Press having been as a junior reporter of the
Manchester Guardian. Subsequently he acted
as private secretary to Sir Edward James Reed,
the* late Chief Constructor of the British Navy,
now member for Cardiff In the Commons.
Thereafter Mr. Norton lived on the Continent for
a time, and was for some years connected
with the Levant Herald, an English and French
journal at Constantinople. Afterwards he went
to Asia Minor as the special correspondent of the
London Daily Telegraph, and was present at
the bombardment of Alexandria. Mr. Norton ar-
rived in Australia some four years ago. His first
literary work in Australia was done as a contri-
butor to The Bulletin. He is not yet 30 years
of age.
We recommend those who purpose furnishing
Hotel, Cottage, or Mansion to call at Lawler’s 608
George-street, Sydney. And we would advise
furnishers to walk round the se i eral well stocked
showrooms in the Central Emporium and get the
salesman to show the best value they can submit,
and then to get each head of a department to
make out a list of whatever was considered first-
class value, and to take the several lists away and
analyse them at leisuie, deducting this item as un-
necessary, or improving upon another, or adding
sundry necessary furnishing requisites in all
probability omitted from the first estimate or lists.
In this way furnishing becomes easy and in the
end safe, as without doubt it is sure.
Now we will commence with the sth floor wher
the Carpets and Leanhrugs and Doormats and
Matting and Linoleum and Oilcloth for the floors
ate. Lpon this floor LaWLER’S show the Tapes-
tries and Velvets and Repps for covering furniture,
as als"’ Tablecovers and Window Curtains in all
the present fashions and material.
First we find that we want Carpet fo certain
bedrooms upon which we do not want to spend
much money. We ask the salesman to show us a
line of Tapestry Carpet, telling him that although
we want a cheap Carpet, yet we do not want a
common or ill-patterned thing.
At once you have placed before yon a range of
Tapestry Carpets at 1/4A yard.
Surprisingly low though the price is yet the
patterns are good and the Carpet most service-
able.
A best spare bedroom next calls for attention
and something deeent is demanded. Wilf you go
3/- or 2/9? Youihinkfora moment and ask to
be shown a line at 2/-, The pattern you find quite
to your satisfaction and as the quality is all that
can be desired you select at 2/-.
A sitting room long keeps you doubtful whethe r
to use Linoleum or Oilcloth or Carpet. At last
you decide in favour or Carpet. You incline for
Brussels but are tempted to inquire whether a
cheap Brussels at 3/- will wear as well as an ex-
cellent 1 apestry at the same money, Tne sales-
man, if honest, will at once decide the matter. A
best Tapestry at 3/. will look better and wear longer
than a Brussels at 3/- or 3/3. You elect to have ihe
best Tapestry in preference and »t 3/-. You can
get ‘ Crossieys” very best from Lawlers. The
Drawing room can have a nice and effective
Tapestry Carpet if you ihiuk fit, but will hanker
after one of the nice thiugs in best Brussels, and
we would say have one by all means.
Best 5 frame Brussels Carpet can be had at the
Central Emporium at 3/9 per yard. An “ extra
super” at 4/-. But 4/6 turns out a carpet that
will last for many a long year, and stand hard
wear too and may be had in all the aesthetic
tints.
Oilcloth and Linoleum, two articles of floor
covering which every one tells the other they had
bought so cheap at such and such a shop may be
had in abundance at LaWLER’S and in several
qualities.
Before touching the price, we would state that
the stock being imported diiect from the factories
is quite new aud that there is not one bad pattern
in the house.
But upon the ticklish and much vexed question
of piice we can only say customers judgment will
be sorely taxed and must be guided largely by the
salesmen who in turn are ruled by the reputation
of the makers.
There is nothing upon which one may be more
deceived than floorcloths. Ranging in prices as
follows: —
Id., 5d., 7d.,9d., lid., 1/6-, 2/-, 2/9, 3/-,
3/3, 3/9, 4/-, 4/6.
You are anxious to put down a good-looking clot-6
upon the hall and landings. You would like to
cover the whole of the space. You don’t care to
exceed 2/-a yard. Can you lay a good-looking
cloth at the money ? You can, you can get a very
good-looking cloth at the money, but there is a
great difference between a good-looking and a
lasting and durable cloth.
If you want a lasting and durable Oilcloth or
Linoleum you will have to pay 3/- at the very
least. If you want a really best, Naims Kirkcaldy
‘ super ”it will cost you 4/3, or 4/6. It cannot be
had for less, and indeed costs 4/- in any of the
London or provincial houses.
Mattings from China—plain or fancy or superior
and in best colorings. Lawlers arrange for special
shipments and the buyer in Hong Kong selects the
newest and best patterns.
Of fancy Matting, yard wide, Lawler’s can sell
if a roll of 40 yards be taken, a very serviceable
Matting at 6d yard, or will supply cut lengths at
7£d.
Then there is a range at 9d. 1/3, 1/6, 2/-, 2 6,
3/-.
Door Mats strong and heavily set with webbed
backs made of best fibre, all sizes, at lowest
possible prices.
For instance a mat weighing 91bs. 5/9, and
extra large door mats weighing 18ibs. 12/-.
Fancy fibre mats with wool borders 4/6 to 15/-.
Door mats or mottled slip mats 1/11 and 2/3 paten
Axminster door mats, superior line, 3/6.
Wool mats in fancy colors 4/6, 5/6, 6/6.
Large fancy jute Tapestry mats 2 yards long
1 yard wide, 1/9, 2/6.
China slip mats with border and reversible,
2 yards long 1 yard wide, worked edges and re-
quiring no border 1/3. 1/6, 2/-.
Hearth Rugs in Tapestry. Fancy patterns 4/6,
5/9, 7/6, 10/6.

Truly LAWLER'S Emporium 608 George-street
is a thoro agh and excellent and economical place
at which to furnish.
Treasure to the extent of 95 millions ster-
ling was recently discovered in a mined palace at
Rabat, Morocco. The Emperor annexed the coin
with all possible despatch, and now Queen Vic-
toria is in an agony'of rage and grief because the
Morocco potentate was not invited to take part in
the Jubilee ceremonials.
Curate: “ Have you been confirmed,
boy?” Boy: “ Yes. sir, I was done three times.”
Curate: “Done three times! What do you
mean!” Boy: “Yes, sir; once by Dr. Brown,
once by Dr. Green, and once by Dr. White.
Mother said if it wasn’t done three times the con- j
flrmation wouldn’t take.

A Two-edged Argument.
“ Lord Salisbury has just publicly stated that all the world was at variance with England on the subject of Freetrade. “That policy,” remarked his lordship, “ is condemned by everyone but ourselves.” — Cablegram.
JOHN BULL: “I’M BEGINNING TO BELIEVE THAT ALL THE WORLD IS LIKEWISE AT VARIANCE WITH US ON SUBJECTS OTHER THAN FREETRADE. JUST LOOK BEHIND YOU, MY LORD."
