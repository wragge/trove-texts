low internal resistance which
is only from 1/3 to 1/6 of
that found in other batter-

What Is Poetry?
The passion for trying to define some-
thing plagues us all. It is a moot point
as to which reaches the more hundreds of
thousands—the formulae into which poets
themselves, philosophers and men-in-the-
street have sought to distil the quintes-
sential meaning of this marvel we call
poetry, or the host of stars visible with a.
telescope in the Milky Way.
In divine inspiration, a fertile imagination
(“One makes a poet. Imagi-
nation, the Divine Vision,’’ says Blake), a
capacity for accurate imitation or lively
invention, an “emotional” temperament, a
fineness of moral fibre (he who hopes “to
write well hereafter in laudable things
ought himself to bee a true Poem,” con-
cludes Milton), a passion for seeking the
most obscure strands in the nexus of cosmic
truth and for adventuring to the “land of
Luthany,” realism, supernaturalism, a fear-
less directness of virile expression (“It may
almost be said that before verse can be
human again it must learn to be brutal,”
said Synge), even the workings of the sex-_
impulse (for Jean de Gourmont declared,
with French frankness, “All true poetry is
sensual, and even sexual,” while Burns more
mildly but still ardently exclaimed, “For
my own part, I never had the least thought
or inclination of turning poet till I got
heartily in love”) —in each of these, and in
as many more equally varied characteristics,
has the essential ingredient at various times
been found. There is not even a common
agreerhent as to what constitutes its anti-
thesis.
Two thousand five hundred years ago,
Simonides, according to Plutarch, rashly
addressed painting as dumb poetry, and
poetry as speaking painting. “What folly is
this!” exclaims the German polyhistor Less-
ing in his “Laocoon” (published a bare 200
years before you and I were born), and
proceeds at length to point out that, while
poetry employs arbitrary, successive,
audible symbols, painting works with _ the
aid of natural, coexistent, visible signs.
There now, there’s the difference for you!
Plato, as everyone knows, granted to poets
the possession of a “divine madness”; and
in his “Poetics,” the first reasoned treatment
of the subject, Aristotle emphasises the
imitative character of the art.
But let us confine ourselves to our own
literature, where the scope is wide enough.
Sir Philip Sidney, in the “Apologie,” our
earliest notable prose critique, reminds us
“it is not riming and versing that maketh a
Poet, no more than a long gowne maketh
an advocate,” and justly claims the Psalms
to be a “heavenlie poesie.” Keats, con-
forming to the traditional theory of the
“divine rapture” of composition, writes in
one of his letters: “If poetry comes not as
naturally as the leaves to a tree, it had
better not come at all.” Wordsworth de-
clares that “all good poetry is the spon-
taneous overflow of powerful feelings.”
Against these set William Morris’s down-
right “That talk of inspiration is sheer non-
sense”; and on another occasion: “If a chap
can’t compose an epic poem while he’s
weaving tapestry, he had better shut up.”
As to its function, Ben Jonson styles it “a
dulcet and gentle philosophy which leads on
and guides us by the hand to action with a
ravishing delight and incredible sweetnes.”
Wordsworth gives us in more prosy fashion
the same thought: “The end of Poetry is to
produce excitement in coexistence with an
overbalance of pleasure,” and announces
his own compositions as having a specific
purpose, namely, “to illustrate the manner
in which our feelings and ideas are asso-
ciated in a state of excitement.” Here, as
everywhere, Shakspeare does not fail us;
and there probably exists in all literature
no finer expression of the true scope and
method of the art than the famous para-
phrase of Plato in the last act of “A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream.” And where can
be found a more stirring claim as to the
practical significance of the bard’s work
than in the magnificent peroration to
Shelley’s magnificent “Defence,” with its
superb final flourish of “Poets are the
unacknowledged legislators of the world”?
Not even the briefest possible treatment
of the subject dares to omit mention in
passing of Milton’s triad on the ideal poet-
ical style, “simple, sensuous, passionate,” or
Gray’s reference to the “pure, perspicuous
and musical” character of lyric expression.
Lastly, as to the countless more formal
definitions. Of these, as Aunt Sally says
in the “Piccalilli Piccanies’ Page,” we select
for printing and special commendation the
following: the present laureate’s “First, the
right words; secondly, those words in the
right order; thirdly, the agreeable sound of
them in sequence”; Arnold’s “A criticism of
life under the laws fixed by poetic truth
and poetic beauty”; Coleridge’s deliberate
“A poem is that species of composition
which is opposed to works of science by
proposing for its immediate object pleasure,
not truth; and from ’all other species
(having this object in common with it) it
is discriminated by proposing to itself such
delight from the whole, as is compatible
with a distinct gratification from each com-
ponent part”; and Shelley’s charming
“Poetry is the record of the best and hap-
piest moments of the best and happiest
minds.”
But to the making of definitions there is
no end, They are bound by the natural
variation of the human mind to be widely
diverse, and in part contradictory, and are
equally certain from the infinite character
of the. subject each and every one to be
woefully inadequate. In the end I come
back with the fullest feeling of satisfaction
to sturdy old Ben Jonson’s simple and
forthright “A Poeme, as I told you, is the
work of the Poet; the end and fruit of his
labour and studye. Poesy is his skill or
'Crafte of making; the very Fruit it selfe,
the reason or forme of his work.” And
really, after all, what more is there to say?
RICHARD MEREDITH.
The Plutocratic Author
What has happened to Anglo-Saxon lit-
erature? I am quite prepared for the retort
that nothing has happened to it, but that
a great deal may have happened to me, that
I live in a backwater of my own conser-
vatism and that the current is still running
strongly elsewhere. Yet 20 years or so
ago the said literature made a noise that
the most indifferent ears could hear. In
fact, they could not avoid hearing it. I
remember when a new poem by Rudyard
Kipling was cabled round the world. Tele-
graphic rates are ever so much cheaper now,
but no Englishman’s poems are considered
worth cabling to-day. Earlier still the latest
chapters of a book by Dickens were rushed
by special messenger across the Atlantic and
received on the other side with the public
interest now lavished on an adulterous coun-
tess. Meredith’s “Diana of the Crossways”
caused a world-wide flutter, and a new book
by Thomas Hardy was an event. His great
epic poem, “The Dynasts,” was, in its way,
a best-seller, like Ethel M. Dell. A new
narrative in verse by Masefield was a sub-
ject for cabled comment, and a large public
hung on the triple skirts of Arnold Bennett’s
“Clayhanger.”
The point is that all these pre-war writers
justified the interest.taken in them. A dis-
cerning critic could build up a reputation
for prescience on them. If he was a good
judge of author-flesh he could back his
fancy year after year and never be haunted
by the fear that he would be let down.
When Conrad, last of the Titans, published
“Almayer’s Folly” the cognoscenti recog-
nised a master. Although the general public
took another 15 years to discover him the
Role had leapt fully armed into the arena.
He proceeded to pile one opus upon
another, each more majestic than the last.
His final work is only a fragment because
his death intervened—but what a magnifi-
cent fragment it is! A critic who put his
shirt on a new writer to-day on the strength
of a preliminary gallop would have to bor-
row his tramfare home. J. M. Tomlinson,
for instance, produced a book 10 years ago
which plainly said that here was a figure
of future renown. When last heard of he
was in- an editorial chair in London, criti-
cising other writers’ books. Aldous Huxley
published two or three novels apparently
of infinite promise. Then he became a
dramatic critic and passed from sight. Cer-
tainly he soon threw the job up in dis-
gust, but his subsequent production has
not come up to early indications.
Coming to the quasi Anglo-Saxons of
America, the position is much the same.
James Branch Cabell took a long time to
hammer out his peculiar style, but finally
he beat out that freak of the Twentieth
century, “Jurgen.” By all the rules, his next
book should have been better. Instead, it
was not quite so'good. Sinclair Lewis pro-
mised to be the Dickens of American low
life, but his “Elmer Gantry” is mere news-
paper stuff compared to “Babbitt.” Theo-
dore Dreiser has inspiration, but his tech-
nique grows steadily worse. Numerous
other writers throw up one good book and
then fade into obscurity. He would be a
bold person who prophesied that because of
“Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,” a profound
study of the eternal feminine, the States
had fathered a new Mark Twain in Anita
Loos. Eugene O’Neill is the lonely excep-
tion that seems to emphasise the rule. His
“Marco Polo” is a true ripening from
“Desire Under the Elms.”
And it isn’t because the literary gents
are being starved. Never has the public
poured out its largesse to letters with less
stint. In America, which sets the standard,
the author must commit suicide to avoid
dying a millionaire. There are at least
10 magazines in that fabulous land with
circulations of over a million apiece.
Editors fight like stockbrokers in the pit
for the privilege of buying the writer’s
goods. If a new novel runs into less than
a quarter of a million it is not considered
a real success. The serial rights are more
valuable than they were, and Hollywood is
in the market for the worse novels of the
year. It recently paid one author £20,000
for screen rights and then discovered that
the story wouldn’t film. Where Meredith
was content with a good cellar and a cot-
tage at Boxhill, Joseph Hergesheimer re-
quires a palace and spends £30,000 on the
furniture inside. To make a noise com-
mensurate with his literary importance, a
writer needs to-day to be at least as rich

They Call It Freedom!
Freedom! The shout goes up from the
lips of thousands of modem artists. Free-
dom from the rules that bound the poet,
the composer, the painter in the days gone
by—that are still binding some old-fashioned
ones. Freedom! Self expression!
Freedom for Poets! Have you rea.d those
reviews that publish solemnly the highbrow
stuff which highbrows solemnly declare to
be great? Let me quote one such poem:
it is by Lydia Bruce, of Chicago, U.S.A.:—
MY TOWN.
I hate the town
Where I was born,
The little town
With the one street
And the barber’s shop
And the paper dog
In the gramophone shop.
I hate the little town
Where I was bom.
In a special note the editor assures us
that this is “forceful style,” “powerful de-
scription,” “surrealistic atmosphere.” True,
there is no metre, no rhyme, no form. True,
if you choose to write it as you write
prose it would not be a poem at all. True,
it lacks all that old-fashioned fogies like
myself used to call poetry. But, then, all
the rules and regulations, metre, rhyme
and the rest were only fetters that had to
be thrown off. Freedom stands revealed.
Freedom for Music! Have you heard
that modem music which is not fettered
by old rules? I commend to you “Hyper-
prism,” by Edgar Varese, a French New’
Yorker. A fiddle or two, a trombone, a
flute, a French horn, a double bass, playing
anything anyhow in any old key (I really
doubt whether there is any key), together
with a ship’s siren, a hammer and anvil,
Chinese blocks, a lion roar, little drums,
medium drums, big drums, tom-toms, tym-
pani and cymbals. That is the orchestra.
It has been actually performed in London.
Eugene Goossens, junior, conducted, and the
composer, who was present, declared it to
be “magnificent.”
Freedom for Opera! They gave a modem
opera at the Opera Comique in Paris. True,
it caused a riot and was not repeated. But
that was not the composer’s fault. The
rioters were not advanced enough. There
was no melody. The voices and the
orchestra were neither in tune nor in the
same key. The heroine, before leaving her
wealthy husband to elope with a poor but
modern artist, sang to us all about the railway
time-tables, third-class fares and the price
of a room with a double-bed in a cheap
hotel. In the second act, when the lovers
were in the said room with the said double-
bed, and the lady’s shoes were worn out, they
sang a duet without melody, about bargain
sales and the price of shoes they could not
afford to pay, while weird noises in the
orchestra “illustrated the state of their
minds.” After which the riot started.
Freedom for Painting! Have you been
in a modern salon and have you seen the
landscapes that resemble a Dutch cheese,
houses that look like the remains of a
derelict kerosene-tin, portraits that remind
you of human monstrosities that should
have been destroyed at birth? “We are
not photographers,” the modern painter will
tell you. “We try to express not what we
see, but what we feel. Our painting is
intellectual.” Maybe. To my obsolete way
of thinking, if these paintings represent their
feelings, then they must feel hideousness
when they behold beauty, lack of shape
where there is symmetry, filth where there
is innocence.
They call it freedom.
I remember a lout who spat against
the wall on a railway-station platform. The
stationmaster reprimanded him. “This is
a free country, ain’t it?” he replied.
Which was freedom, too.

The Artistic Lover
Wonderful is the difference between
our way and the Continental way of treating
men of genius, when the man of genius
happens to be, among other things, a man
of many love affairs. Here is a just pub-
lished life of the Hungarian Franz Liszt
by that eminent French litterateur and bio-
grapher Guy de Pourtales. Everyone
knows that Liszt was the supreme genius
of the piano. On that subject there is
nothing new to be said. It is the story
of the man’s life, and the respectful, even
reverential, way it is treated that gives a
reader in this country something to think
about.
Everything he wanted came to Liszt,
almost without the asking. He had honors
paid to him by kings; he had love made
to him by princesses; he had gold showered
on him by impresarios; and he had his
carriage pulled along by adoring mobs in
every chief city of Europe. To all this he
added the flair of a man of religion. It
is on record that when, in his middle age,
he was residing in Rome, Pope Pius IX.
paid him the honor of a personal visit. A
little later, at the age of 54, he decided to
become an abbe, and was admitted by
the Church to minor orders. When he died
at Bayreuth, in 1886, in his 75th year, he
had collected most of the world’s laurels;
and there was not much doubt, in the pious
circle round him at the last, that some
quite special honors were waiting for him
in the world to come.
He was an infant prodigy, the son of a
certain Adam Liszt, whom Prince Ester-
hazy had made overseer of one ol his
Hungarian estates. His Hungarian-Magyar
ancestry was not in his favor. Paris was
the centre of the art world; and to the
cultured Parisian a person of Magyar descent
was not so very much better than a savage.
But Liszt was an exception to all rules.
Tall, slight, with a shock of black hair and
a manner at the piano that women found
irresistible, he swept audiences of all nation-
alities in front of him. His mixture of
romantic aestheticism with the emotionalism
of a Byron and the courtesy of a Bayard
carried him from one triumphant “affair” to
another. At the age of 23 he eloped with,
or let himself be carried off by, an infatu-
ated Frenchwoman, the Comtesse d’Agoult,
who was married and six years his senior.
Their irregular union lasted, with some
intervals of absence, for eight years. Three
children were born, one of whom, Cosima,
emulated her artistic parents by forming an
alliance with Wagner while the latter’s
wife was alive.
We hear of episodes with the German
actress Charlotte de Hugn and with that
dashing demi-mondaine Lola Montez, of
whom the respectful biographer tells us
“he allowed her to make love to him.”
At one stage Sand came into the
picture; and she seems, though the details
are obscure, to have caused some breach
between Liszt and Chopin, though they
subsequently made it up. There was a
prolonged association with the Russian
Princess Carolyne of Sayn, described by
M. de Pourtales as “an impassioned
Amazon.” “The strong piety of each drew
them together,” naively explains the bio-
grapher. At Weimar, in 1868, when the
music-maker was nearly 60, Baroness Mey-
endorff appeared, and Liszt, we are in-
formed-note the delicate suggestion that,
no gentleman could do otherwise —“yielded
to this supreme force.” Then a year or
two later there was the Countess Janina,
described as “a jealous creature,” who
wrote from America to her virtuoso, then
engaged on his piouS musical work “The
Christ” —“I am setting out this week to
pay you for your letter.” She actually did
arrive, with pistols and poison phials, and
stormed into the great man’s bedroom. We
are told, however, that he repulsed her
“with admirable calm.” No pity, you see,
for the woman who was so ill advised as to
be jealous over a man like Liszt!
It is all very interesting, and not without
an object-lesson for those brought up in
a different atmosphere and inheriting an-
other sort of tradition. No English bio-
grapher could write the story of Liszt as
M. de Pourtales writes it. The English-
man, with all his admiration for the artist,
would be on the defensive; he would be
apologising most of the time for the man.
The Frenchman cannot see there is anything
to apologise for. “Liszt had many loves,”
he tells us, “but the order which dominates
his works, as it governed his life, was pur-
suit of an ideal.” It is the same ideal that
Shelley put into verse: —
In many mortal forms I rashly sought
The image of that idol of my thought.
But in English-speaking countries the ex-
cuse for the amorist—pursuit of an ideal-
does not hold. An earlier biographer of
Liszt, James Huneker, describes him aptly
enough as “the most pursued man on the
continent.” A few years earlier Byron had
the same distinction in England. But
Byron was hounded out of the country,
Shelley was ostracised, and Keats ignored.
If it is true that to understand everything
is to forgive everything, we have something
to learn from other nations in the way of
understanding of the artistic temperament.
That much may be conceded—even if we
still refuse to glorify rakishness because it
happens to be allied with a gift of music
and a haunting smiie.
A. J. B.
Early Days
Professor Shann, of the University of
Perth, has compiled a book which is really
the story of the well-known Bussel family
over a period of some 20 or 30 years. This
family left England about 1830 and settled
in the south-eastern corner of Westralia.
The book is mainly made up from letters
and diaries written by different members of
the family. It takes its name, “Cattle
Chosen,” from the original head station.
The station itself was named from the fact
that its position was fixed by a wandering
cow. The book, a beautifully-written story
of hardship and real adventuring, is as inter-
esting as any novel, and is real Australian
history.
And the main characters in it, real people
and real pioneers, are cultured, refined
people. Why is it that practically all Aus-
tralian writers, when they set out to write
stories of Australian life, ignore characters
like the Bussels? John Bussel was an
English gentleman and a close friend of
Governor Stirling. Amongst his first belong-
ings brought here were his English and Latin
poets. To him the settlers turned for advice
and help. His was the brain and the driving
power that converted what was virgin forest
into what is now thriving settlement. And
working at the foundations of the Australian
nation were in those days many John Bus-
sels. There could never have been an Aus-
tralian nation without them. And without
their kind Australia could not hold its own
to-day. Yet when Australians set to the
making of Australian stories they generally
turn for their main characters anywhere but
to the refined, cultured man. He, if he is
used at all, is given the part of villain and
caricatured. He, the energy-stimulator and
director, is regarded as a sort of imitation
Englishman, and therefore not good Aus-
tralian.
No one is going to deny that unlettered
shearers, bullock-drivers, cocky-farmers,
laborers and even swagmen may have excel-
lent qualities. But they are not the only
ones that have excellent qualities. Educa-
tion does not always strip a man of these
things. Followers of these occupations .play
an essential part in nation-building, but it
is only the part of the bricklayers in the
building of a cathedral. The cathedral could
not well be built without them. But it
would not be built at all if it were left to
them.
There is no doubt Henry Lawson has had
a tremendous influence on Australian litera-
ture. With his natural genius he described
Australian life from his point of view. Now
the tendency is for Australian writers to
describe life as he described it. They blind
themselves to Australian life as it is from
other points of view. And there are other
points of view. A book like “Cattle
Chosen” shows that plainly enough. The
sentimental idealisation of one class at the
expense of other classes is detrimental to
historical truth. Historical truth is the
main feature of “Cattle Chosen.”
ALAN D. MICKLE.
A Satchel of Books
Lulcundoo, by Edward Lucas White
(Benn). A collection of short stories in
horror—deadly if taken near midnight.
The Treasury, by Thomas L. Heath (Put-
nam). A volume of “The Whitehall Series”
designed to provide authoritative informa-
tion about the various departments of gov-
ernment in England.
Chained , by Frank Hird (Chapman and
Hall). John Dcrington made a will by
which he left an ample fortune to his
daughter Jane, but bound her by conditions,
one of them the maintenance of a cattle-farm.
How Jane bore her chains and slipped a link
on to a lover makes an entertaining novel.
Marguerite , Count Morin, Alfred de Vigny
and the Path of Glory, by Anatole France
(John Lane). The essay on Alfred de Vigny
is now translated into English for the first
time. “The Path of Glory” includes some
of France’s latest work, a series of papers
bearing more or less directly on the Great
War.
Palm Fronds, by E. Coungeau (Smith and
Paterson, Brisbane). A small volume of
poems, many of them contributed to The
Bulletin and the Woman’s Mirror. The
author has a keen sense of the music in
words, and makes her compositions ring
sweetly to the ear. Though without any
striking originality of thought, the poems
are creditable in form and rich with color
and imagery. A worthy addition to Aus-
tralia’s not overladen shelf of poetsi.
The Constant Wife, by W. Somerset
Maugham (Heinemaun). A comedy in three
acts. The play was staged in 1926 and received
the discriminating applause of the limited
number of playgoers who appreciate literary
value in drama. The lines of the comedy
are packed with .epigrams sometimes merely
smart but frequently reflective.
The Hygiene of Youth and Beauty, by
Josif Ginsburg (Cornstalk Co.). An Aus-
tralian edition of a work by a Los Angeles
plastic surgeon whose business appears to be
moulding the human face and figure into the
lines of conventional beauty. An instructive
book that should be kept on the top shelf
out of the way of prying menfolk.
The Letters of Richard Wagner (Dent).
This first volume of Wagner’s letters,
selected and edited by Prof. Wilhelm Ult-
mann, covers the period 1830-58. That
Wagner did not estimate the spiritual force
of music in Albion too highly may be judged
from the following: “Good English com-
positions—correctly worked out as examples
in arithmetic, but without a trace of
imagination or invention.”
Wine, Women and. War (Heinemann).
A diary of disillusionment, the record of the
actions and reactions, recorded almost at
the moment of their execution and percep-
tion, of a young American attached in the
Great War to the Intelligence branch of the
TJ.S.A. forces. It makes no pretension to
literary style, but is written in a staccato
fashion that though it hits at first ends in
boring intensely.
Number Fire Joy Street (Basil Black-
well). Many children will knock at this door,
which gives entrance to an ample hall
wherein are gathered dragons and witches,
blue dogs and green parrots and all sorts
of quaint creatures introduced by Walter
de la Mare, Compton Mackenzie, Algernon
Blackwood, Hilaire Belloc and many others
who have left their studies where they manu-
facture highbrow novels for grown-ups to
come to number five and make merry the
hearts of children. A very delightful book.
Dog-face , the Story of a Quest, by John
Easton (Fhilip Allan). About 12 years ago
a sect appeared in Lhasa known as “The
Blue Hats,” composed of fanatics who aimed
at the destruction of the Dalai Lama and
the control of Tibet. The leader was known
as the Dog-faced Abbot. An Englishman
named Fevcrsham became embroiled in the
affairs of the organisation, and disappeared.
After many years he attempted to communi-
cate with the outside world by a messenger
through whose murder a cipher concealed
in a prayer-wheel fell into the hands of
Ralph Merriton, manager of a tea-garden in
the foothills of the Himalayas. The story
then turns on the adventures of Merriton
and his resourceful friend Major Clampetc
in attempting to penetrate to Lhasa in order
to rescue Feversham. A gripping yarn.


Avoid This Condition
Use Cuticura to help prevent
premature baldness. Dandruff
and irritation point to an unhealthy
condition of the scalp which leads
to falling hair and premature bald-
ness. Regular shampoos with Cuti-
cura Soap, assisted by Cuticura
Ointment when required, do much
to prevent such a condition.

Lullaby.
The swans are plucking their breasts for
thee,
Whiter than any snow;
And the pollen that cumbers the homing bee
Comes from the hills aglow
With scented blossom, a seething sea,
Where the laughing breeze hangs low.
The stars are paving a twinkling way,
A-dust for thee with gold;
And deep in the death of the warm-blue day
The billowed clouds grow cold;
And over the hills, oh far away,
The sheep have turned to the fold.
The waves are singing a haunting song
For thee of the wave-blue eyes;
And the mer-folk are weaving it, swift and
. strong,
A shimmering spell which vies
With the million quivering lights that throng
The blue of the midnight skies.
The swans are plucking their breasts for
thee,
Softer than any snow;
There is a song in the heart of the sea,
And the homing bee hums low;
The birds are silent upon the tree,
But the cricket is singing down below.

The Red Road.
The Red Road’s calling, and I must follow
Up the track that the bellbirds know;
Where bracken laces the purple hollow
The whipbird’s calling, and I must go!
It climbs to the wild dawn’s restless glory ;
It cuts a path past the tall white gum ;
It beckons me, like an unread story;
It stirs my soul, and it leaves me dumb.
Here, where the shadows love to linger,
Dappling leaf-patterns on curving track ;
Traced by the magic of fairy finger,
Umber, and neutral and soft lamp-black.
I have gone with the white mist’s gentle
weeping;
When the mountain wind was keen and
strong;
I have known it waking, and watched it
sleeping,
When the night of winter was bleak and
long.
I have seen Spring pass in her wistful
dreaming,
And the wattles have quickened to fairy
gold.
I have seen the moon’s white wonder,
gleaming
On a tale that is never too often told.
All its moods I have loved, and taken ;
Its very self I have made my own
When the trembling gums by the gale were
shaken;
When its glamor was mine and mine alone !
The Red Road’s calling, and I must follow
Up the track that the bellbirds know;
Where bracken laces the purple hollow
The whipbird’s calling, and I must go!

The Choosing.
They want me to marry a lass with a farm,
And indeed for herself I wish her no harm ;
But, though she may drive with her butter
to town,
My Margery’s arms are softer than down.
1 know that the lassie has gold of her own
That her house and her barn are builded
of stone;
But she hasn’t the look of someone 1
know—
For Margery’s arm is whiter than snow.
She has cocks and has hens, and has turkey-
and geese,
With a pig in a pen for constant increase ;
She has bees at the swarm, and hives full
of comb—
But Margery’s arm would bring a man
home.
I’ve a wish for the farm but none for her-
self,
For she sits up as stiff as plates on a shelf;
And maybe, at night, I’d be chilled to the
bone —
But Margery’s arm is warm as my own.
Now what would you do if you had to be me,
With choice of good gear, or a lass on your
knee?
Would you turn to the lass and let the
farm go ?
For Margery’s arm’s as deep as the snow!

You raised me, Love, from darkness drear
Into a world of strangest bliss.
New life you breathed into my soul
And raptures brought me with your kiss.
I care not what the end shall be,
Nor count the seeds of sorrow sown;
One hour of Love has sweetened Death—-
I thank Thee, God, that I have known.

Pan.
I caught a glimpse of him within the shade
Among the cool green-tangled water-weeds.
I heard sweet echoes of the tune he played
Upon the magic reeds.
And the wild wonder of his music stole
Upon my captured senses, weaving round
My prisoned thought and my enchanted soul
A silver web of sound.
I glimpsed the bright eyes of a naiad there,
Her nut-brown head low-pillowed on the
grass.
A dryad twined the ivy in her hair,
The pool her looking-glass.
The freshness of cool water filled the glade.
The purling ripples blent their melodies
With those wild tunes the magic piper played
Beneath the leafy trees.
Whence came this vision of deep woods and
bowers,
Of trailing honeysuckle, bee-possessed;
Dim forest aisles and fragile pallid flowers.
White waterways at rest,
Old drooping willows drenched in tender
green,
Grey shadows shot with emerald and gold,
Depths unexplored, young moss and ferns
between
The lichened rocks age-old?
Shall he, the lover of secluded vales,
Frequent this sun-assaulted treeless plain,
Where day by day the hope, the courage
fails.
Where day by day the grain
Withers and wilts ; beneath the pitiless light,
Onslaught of heat and blinding splendor,
dies;
Where silent, stricken, finding no respite,
The brown earth breathless lies?
Nay, for the dream has passed of waters cool
And far faint echoes of the wood-god’s
tune,
Whose pastoral melodies were wont to fill
The hush of the mid-noon.
Not here ’neath brazen skies, in glaring day,
Unveiled, stark, garish, terrible comes he,
But in the deep-green woods of far away
He pipes in Arcady.

ETHEL MARTYR.
At Noon.
[n the lazy heat of the golden noon,
The blue burnt out of the cloudless sky,
I thank the gods for the treasured boon
Of green leaves meeting a wearied eye.
In the quiet peace of the living green
Fs deep content and a solace cool
From the aching brown of the pastures lean,
The dancing haze aud the phantom pool.
In the green of leaves is the breath of sleep,
The cool caress of the crystal dew,
In a quiet reach where a man may creep
To fashion his broken dreams anew.
You may keep if you will the colors rare
Of day’s debut and the day’s demise,
But let me have for the midday glare
The tender green of the river trees.
QUEENSLAND.
ELOUERA.
The Mocking Present.
I stood upon a terraced height
At glowing end of day,
When ’neath me, like a bowl of wine
Brimful, the Harbor lay.
Made captive by the magic scene,
So lit, so glorified,
I saw all ships, since Phillip’s ships,
At anchor on its tide.
As there I stood held by the Past,
To all the Present blind,
I saw that Fleet, that motley Fleet,
Stems heading to the wind.
Great craft and small, they lay at rest,
Safe moored and canvas furled,
That once had sailed the seas that wash
The ports of all the world.
Barques, schooners, brigs and full-rigged
ships—
Craft seen no more by men
On any sea, ’neath any skies—
I saw them all again.
While, richer, rosier grew the light
From western wells outpoured,
Above them fluttered many flags,
And many sea-birds soared.
Then, suddenly, a warning blared
As, black of hull and mast,
A collier stealing out to sea
Recalled me from the Past.
As trailing rolling smoke behind,
That grim shape steamed to sea,
No more a bowl brimful of wine
The Harbor seemed to be.
Then, while I still dim-visioned them,
That fleet of old-time craft,
Grey twilight fell, and at my side
The mocking Present laughed.
As on and on the collier crept,
Smoke trailing, trailing foam,
I sought the noisy waterside
And took a ferry home.

ECONOMY ON THE HORIZON.
The report goes abroad that 'the Federal
Government has taken fright at its own
lavishness and the lavishness of the States,
wherefore a campaign of economy is fore-
shadowed. Ministers are expected to spread
their postal and telegraph programme,
amounting to four millions for the year,
over various years, and to abate their velo-
city at Canberra, and they will urge the
States not to ask for the Commonwealth’s
name on the back of the promissory-note
so largely or so often.. The reason assigned
is that the big works and jobs programme
of last year has been followed by a bigger
one,' and that the money can’t be got at
reasonable interest, and perhaps not even at
moderately unreasonable interest. From this
it may be suspected that the New York
money market, viewed as a boundless source
of supply, has already shown signs of weari-
ness. But public economy hasn’t com-
menced yet; it only looms in the offing. On
the other hand poverty and distress have
commenced; in fact, the chairman of the
N.S.W. Northern Collieries Association
stated the other day that ‘"never before in
the history of the State had the slackening
of trade been so intense.” This shows that-
the biggest loan policy and the biggest
effort to pay wages to everybody for build-
ing mostly-unprofitable works are dust and
ashes, and the more intensely the vision of
prosperity is pursued along these lines the
more velocity does the retreating apparition
develop. This is especially the case when
productive industry is hampered by strikes
on a vast scale, job control and short-hour
and long-wage decisions manufactured in
freak courts wdiich at times refuse to hear
evidence.
* * * *
A grotesque aspect of the position is that
the moneys raised in London or New York
to provide work here don’t provide work
here. They never come here. A great part
stays where it is to pay interest and other
charges, which now amount to some 33
millions a year. Unless some Government
can add hard labor to economy, and pay this
great sum with Australian products, it must
go on raising this sum, with something more
added each year, just as if it had never
heard of economy. Anything raised abroad
over and above the amount mentioned
arrives in the shape of goods, and in that
case our own people are minus the employ-
ment involved in making the goods. There
is thus a gloomy suspicion that the cutting
down of public works policies, if it stands
by itself, will leave the awful financial situ-
ation abroad very much where it is. On
the other hand, local loans do provide
work if spent on public jobs constructed with
local materials. That is to say, they take
men away from what should be productive
toil—the making of things which can be
sold to help in meeting the nation’s lia-
bilities —and put them to the making of
things which can’t. And most of these,
when made, are a permanent tax on the
community; and this tax is often so great
that it would have paid better if the
builders had been enrolled in a stand-
ing army and set to the healthy occupation
of learning the goose-step.
* * •!* *
The position is one in which any scheme
of economy alone is bound to be insufficient.
It is necessary to also strike the import-
ing business a mighty blow. And that can-
not be done unless the Arbitration Courts co-
operate; for raised duties can be nullified
by higher costs. The point indeed has been
reached when there is need for the closest
co-operation betw r en the Tariff Board and
the Arbitration Court; and as part of its
economy programme the Federal Govern-
ment should see that this co-operation is
established.
EVIDENCE, INFERENCE AND THE
JURY.
When Mrs. A swears in the witness-box
that she saw Mr. B, her neighbor, take up
a brick and throw it at a Pomeranian dog,
the darling of Mrs. A’s heart, and there-
upon the pet died, she is giving direct evi-
dence. When, however, Mr. B’s tyke is
poisoned and he proves that Mrs. A had
uttered threats that she would be even with
him in the matter of the Pomeranian, and
furthermore that on a particular day she
had purchased poison of a kind calculated
to kill dogs, and still furthermore that at
or about the time of the decease of the tyke
she had been seen in her garden carrying
dog-enticing meat, he is giving indirect or
circumstantial evidence applicable to the
inquiry as to who killed the tyke. It points
in the direction of Mrs. A, but is far from
conclusive, despite what Mr. B’s family
may think. There is no necessary connec-
tion between the facts and the inference.
The casual observer may look askance at
Mrs. A and “have his doubts on her,” but
that is not sufficient in law. Could by any
sweep of the imagination the murder of the
tyke come before a Judge and jury, his
Honor would doubtless point out to the
12 wise men that, admitting the facts stated,
it was for the jury not merely to ask them-
selves whether those facts were consistent
with Mrs. A’s guilt, but whether they were
inconsistent with any other rational conclu-
sion. Could Mrs. A and she alone have
caused the death? Were the facts sufficient
to exclude every other hypothesis but the
one reflecting on the lady? When Joseph’s
cup was found in the innocent Benjamin’s
sack, the fact looked very damning against
him, and doubtless the Egyptians would
have found it all-sufficient without worry-
ing about the subtleties of circumstantial
evidence. Young Ben’s plaint that some-
one had put it there wouldn’t pass in the
Egyptian police-court. Yet Joseph knew
it to be true.
* * * *
Eminent Judges have declared that evi-
dence of circumstances may sometimes be
more conclusive than the direct evidence of
facts. Direct statements of alleged facts
may take on the color of personality, where-
as indirect circumstances are less likely to
be imbued with any characteristic taint. Yet
the public mind has always been suspicious
of convictions on circumstantial evidence.
So much depends on inference, and the man
who would not doubt his neighbor’s truth-
fulness may have a mental reservation as
to his capacity for drawing sound deduc-
tions. It is easier to detect a lie than it is
to run down a fallacy, reasoning in a dry
light being the precious gift of an endowed
few. The mind has been compared to “the
distorting power of an uneven mirror im-
parting its own nature to the true nature
of things.” As Baron Alderson remarked,
“the mind is apt to take a pleasure in adapt-
ing circumstances to one another and even
straining them a little, if need be, to force
them to form parts of one connected
whole.” It is probably due to an inherent
doubt of the capacity of the average man
to in all cases draw a fair inference or come
to an undoubtedly sound conclusion out of
a tangle of perplexing facts and circum-
stances that cases depending wholly on
circumstantial evidence are viewed with
dubiety.
* * * *
Often, too, there is a sense of dispropor-
tion in vital inferences depending on, it
may be, very small facts. That a man
should be convicted on a laundry mark or
meet his end through the crossing of a “t”
seems a distortion of values. Yet Lord Chief
Justice Cockburn said in the great Mat-
lock will case: “The habit of crossing a tin
'to’ in a particular way was its most convinc-
ing incident.” all men are more or less
prone to appraise their fellow men on a
face valuation. Take the notorious Crippen.
There was a man convicted on absolutely
circumstantial evidence who appeared to
be a quiet, kindly, gentle sort of person said
to be popular among his acquaintances for
his courtesy, and living apparently on very
good terms with his wife; yet he carried on
a second life beneath this surface crust of
virtues and murdered his wife under cir-
cumstances of heartless infidelity and with
cool premeditation. He was seemingly so
good a man that it required an effort to
conceive him to be the callous brute he
was. It is because of the uncertainty of the
personal factor in every man called upon
to be the judge of his fellow men that the
very excellent principle embodied in weigh-
ing circumstantial evidence has been
evolved—not to return a verdict of guilty
unless the jury is satisfied that upon no
rational hypothesis other than that alleged
against the accused can the facts be
accounted for.
OUR NEIGHBORS IN THE NORTH.
The Teuton is a person very much admired
in military circles in Japan. When Nippon
is spoken of as “the Britain of the Pacific”
there are quiet smiles behind discreet hands;
but when she is dubbed “the Prussia of
Asia” the inheritors of the old Bushido
spirit can hardly contain their banzais.
During the war it was difficult for some
Japanese to dissemble their admiration of
the Prussian even though their country was
at war with him. Nowadays they view his
resolute return to the scenes from which
he was forcibly evicted six or seven years
ago as further proof of his possession of
the virtues that made modern Japan. They
regard the German-trained advance of
Russia into further Asia via the land routes
as at least as important as the invasion by
Western Europeans via the sea, especially
as the latter have received a setback recently
which has landed them where they were
when they started 400 years ago, namely
in the coastal ports of China.
On the commercial side the new Japo-
German treaty provides for the resuscitation
of the badly-damaged economic constitu-
tion of Nippon by means of German in-
dustry. In return the Germans agree to
let Japan into the secrets of certain dyes
alleged to be the exclusive property of
German firms. The German receives all
the benefits of the most-favored nation
clauses in right of residence, leasing of land
and the like, and in return agrees to admit
Japanese into Germany without let or hin-
drance. The Japanese who want to reside
in Germany are few and far between, but,
compared with the Australian and American
attitude, the friendliness of the Teuton is
soothing to the nation’s pride. Japan
already has a treaty with Russia which
leaves each party free to devour the seg-
ments of the Chinese and Korean melons
already in their hands.
Consequently recent events in China did
not cause the military -realists of Japan
particular concern. The British struggle to
maintain the supremacy of the white man
in further Asia they viewed with the detach-
ment of so many Buddha images. When
some geishas were outraged in Nanking
they hardly changed their facial expres-
sion, whereas a few years ago they would
have occupied a province. They viewed
the Bolshevik regime in Hankow with the
same unconcern. So long as British bay-
onets preserved their cotton-mills and bank
balances in Shanghai the rights of the
foreigner in the rest of China could go
hang. Their allies, the Russians and the
Germans, had no rights to lose, having had
them removed at the instance of the
Western European Powers during the war.
An immediate result or by-product of
all these conflicting aims is a very sur-
prising thing. It is the muddled movement
courteously described as Chinese National-
ism. Fifteen years ago the idea w T as scarcely
known. If China went to war half the pro-
vincial viceroys promptly declared their
non-connection with the business. To-day
even the most debauched bandit in uni-
form proclaims his depredations as a crusade
on behalf of the country’s sovereign rights.
The Christian General Feng has committed
some tidy massacres of fellow Christians
in the cause. Even Peking welcomed the
successes of the rebels of the South because
they were supposed to be spreading the
same gospel or ideal. A few years ago
the Northerner regarded the Southerner as
scarcely human. To-day the Shanghai mob
(which chants a language no Cantonese can
make head or tail of, though he can read
it) is striking, boycotting and rioting on
their behalf. Still further north, the Tien-
tsin mob has shown a similar disposition.
A genuine nation of 400 millions (or what-
ever the figure really is) shouting for the
flag, bawling its national anthem (when
composed) and aching to impress upon the
world its sacred unity assumes the dimen-
sions of a cosmic jimjam.
Meantime Europe, as the Japanese
framers of the German treaty affirm, is a
camp divided against itself. So struck, in
fact, are the foreign residents of Shanghai
with the possibility that they may be for-
gotten in the international hurly-burly that
they have formed a Fascist party to look
after their own independence.
FENG-SHUI.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The New Theory of Arbitration.
If the object of a Court of Arbitration is
to preserve industrial peace, irrespective of
any other consideration, then Judge Beeby
must be congratulated on his adroitness in
ending the dispute, strike, lock-out or what-
ever it was that kept the wharf-lumpers of
Australia from their lumping for seven days.
The Judge did not arbitrate. Instead, he
issued a ukase. The ukase pleased the
wharfies’ federation immensely, since it de-
clared, in effect, that in one important par-
ticular the law or award made by Beeby
to govern their industry was, in the opinion
of Beeby, after consulting Beeby, an ass of
a law, proof of that being the abso-
lute refusal of the wharfies to obey it. The
concession saved the faces of the federa-
tion leaders, -who were afraid that for once
in a way their bluff was going to be called,
and the shipowners had to accept the situa-
tion because Capital can’t afford to be any-
thing but law-abiding.
The interim award legalises defiance of
the main award on the matter of pick-ups
until such time as the Court (which is go-
ing to give the wharfies’ case precedence
over those of all other workers because they
are so very turbulent and disobedient) shall
make an entirely new award.
With whatever good intentions Judge
Beeby's ruling was framed, it specifically
and definitely adds the following principles
to the theory of industrial arbitration: —
(1) An object of the Arbitration Court
is to end any strikes or lock-outs that may
occur in defiance of its jurisdiction.
(2) To effect that purpose the action of
labor unions which have refused to obey
an award may be-legalised by the Court with-
out reference to either party.
(8) The extent to which the Court may
proceed in legalising defiance of its own
awards shall be in exact ratio to the ability
of the labor union concerned to penalise the
community by its lawlessness.
Why the principle should be confined to
the Arbitration Court this paper does not
know. Criminal Court proceedings, for
example, would be much more exciting if
accused persons were provided with fire-
arms and allowed to make demonstrations
in the dock.

The Curse of the Casual.
Most of the labor troubles that beset Aus-
tralia arise in occupations that are wholly
or partly filled by casual laborers. In this
category may be placed the wharf-lumpers,
ships’ firemen, seamen, miners and mine
laborers, shearers and shed-hands and men
employed on road construction and other
public works. The degree of casualty, of
course, varies in various occupations. In
some, as in the case of the wharfies, the
engagement may be for a few hours; ships’
firemen and seamen sign on for a voyage;
shearers go from station to station; miners,
in many instances, if thej 7 feel that way,
may have steady jobs. But taken as a
class this unit of the industrial army
has very little sense of responsibility to-
wards those who employ him. He hardly
knows an employer; he only knows an em-
ploying class. His only spiritual advisers,
the union bosses, din it into his ears on
every possible occasion that he is a deeply
wronged individual, and that the best way
to right his wrongs is to do as little work
as possible and get as much as possible
for it.
To the extent that he is the victim of
social conditions and industrial institutions
that conspire to make him an unfaithful
servant, the casual worker is wronged. An
intelligent State—if such a thing can be
imagined—would do everything a State may
legitimately and helpfully do to wipe casual-
labor off the map. It, is frightfully expensive,
terribly slow, and extremely unreliable. Its
worst enemy is the machine. Automatic
stoking machines, oil-burning appliances and
the introduction of the motor-ship threaten
to make the stoker unnecessary. The ten-
dency, too, with shipping companies is to
endeavor to give good seamen practically
a permanent engagement. In the United
States machinery is used in mines to an
extent unparalleled in other countries. Fewer
miners are needed, and those who are em-
ployed have a higher sense of responsibility
—expensive machinery is in their care —and
the competent man is sure of a permanent
job.
Too much donkey-work is done by men
in this country. Australian ports are notori-
ously ill-equipped—some of the methods in
vogue on some wharves, even- in Sydney,
were old when the Shepherd Kings ruled


Egypt. The vagaries of shipping, no doubt,
necessitate that an elastic working force
should be available, but with more
machinery and a clear conception of the
fact that casual labor is bad for everybody,
wharf work could be reorganised so that
fully half the number of men at present
employed would have permanent jobs. The
principal obstacle in the way is the wharfies’
federation, which detests the idea of per-
manent employment, and guards the sacred
principle of casual labor like a tigress
defending her cubs.
But the casual laborer will have to go.
His place in modern industry grows smaller
with every improvement in equipment and
organisation. He is an industrial and poli-
tical menace, continually breaking loose
and upsetting apple-carts, and the only way
to cure him is to end him.

The Demand for a Belisarius Pratten.
Customs Minister Pratten, doing battle
with another deputation, said that he
wouldn’t for a moment dream of putting
higher duties on socks and stockings than
the Tariff Board recommended. Still, there
was no reason why he should have made
the hosiery duty a deferred one and given
the importers seven months in which to
load up; and the fact that he made the iron
and steel duties lower than the Board’s
recommendation was inconsistent. Dreams
shouldn’t work exclusively in favor of the
outsider.
The Minister of Customs added that it
was for the stocking industry to satisfy
the Tariff Board by sworn evidence that it
needed immediate assistance and not assist-
ance seven months ahead, and to show that
it was capable of supplying the nation’s
requirements if it got what it asked for.
A Pratten cast in heroic mould—a Napo-
leon or Hannibal or Belisarius Pratten,
or even an Abraham Lincoln Pratten —
might take the sporting risk, if there is one,
of a temporary shortage in legwear while
Australia is rising to the industrial occasion,
and close the door hard. To postpone the
granting of full Protection, unless the manu-
facturers have achieved without it the re-
sults which it is expected to bring about,
is illogical and Freetraderish. The new
duties on rice, potatoes and such-like
weren’t hampered by the proviso that the
farmer must grow the rice and potatoes
and such-like first and be Protected after-
wards.
Anyhow, hosiery isn’t absolutely essen-
tial, as is proved by the fact that most
people dispense with it one-third of the
time. In addition to all else, darning is an
honorable occupation. And supposing,
though it seems impossible, that despite
gigantic efforts the local furnishment of
hose should prove so inadequate that the
last stocking fell into disrepair and the girl
was visible through it, any Government
which embodied Scipio African us Pratten
would import a consignment of the en-
velope for the lower limb, pay itself the
duty, however high, and then put the goods
on the market at a reduction.
This line of thought might be applied to
all manner of articles. And if unreasonable
demands re long wages and short hours
made a new difficulty, something might be
done to meet the case if the Court of
Dethridge, Lukin and Beeby was given an
indefinite rest.
•
The Great Pro- Russian Delusion.
Lloyd George belongs to the extensive
band who love their enemies but hate their
friends; they are willing and anxious to do
good to those who have injured them, but
have no particular use for those who have
helped them. Lately he lamented to a
body called “the League of Nations Union”
because Russia had been “robbed of pro-
vinces,” wherefore its rage, he seemed to
hold, was fully excusable. Apparently the
inverted little Welshman would almost give
Poland and Finland back to Russia as a
reward for its misdeeds.
A great Red literature of deception has
grown up over these lost provinces, but
the story is simple enough. The Czardom
was replaced by a republic which tried to
be a genuine republic. But the Red
element, which wasn’t hanged in time,
appealed to the tired people with a pro-
gramme of immediate peace, all the land
for the farmers, all the factories for the
artisans, and most things for everybody.
Its revolution was a glowing success for
many reasons, one being that the army
wanted to disperse back home and not be
out of the division. Then the usurping
oligarchy intimated to the Hun that Russia
was “out of the war,” really believing, it
would seem, that a polite resignation was
sufficient. The Hun replied that it could
get out at a price; and though Trotsky
urged a frenzied effort to get the demoral-
ised and almost wholly disbanded army
together again, his pals realised that if any-
thing of the sort was attempted, after the
wonderful promise of peace, it would be
easier for the troops to kill them than the
enemy. So the Hun got his figure, which
was the surrender of Poland, Latvia,
Esthonia, most of Southern Russia (the
black-soil country), some of the oil regions,
and Finland. The more remote parts were
made nominal republics till the Hun would
have more time to organise his plunder.
Lenin and Co. saved their revolution
out of the debris, and not much else. But
the German collapse became obvious a half-
year later, despite Russia’s desertion, and
Fritz fled out of Odessa. Now the Lloyd
Georges and the Rammy Macdonalds seem
to consider it a shame that Soviet Russia
didn’t get Poland, Lithuania, Finland, etc.,
back into bondage, and all the tribe of
Red-Flaggers agree. They also agree that
it was Britain and the Allies who robbed
Russia, and not the imperial military Hun.
If Fritz had won the war, as he nearly
did, it is interesting to speculate as to
which bit of timbered country he would
have hanged the boss Muscovite com-
munists on. No one can picture him toler-
ating, just beyond his new border, a Gov-
ernment with a mission to paint the world
Red and an incurable desire to meddle in
all the world’s concerns.
«
John Bull Takes to Drink, Too.
The sad news is cabled from London that
Mr. Leacock, or Lowcock or Cockles, or
something like that, who is something or
other to some society for the promotion or
protection of British interests in some way
or another, has heard of our tariff by cable
and is shaken up. The same is reported
of a certain Corcoran, possibly the ex-
captain of the Pinafore. When the message
concerning him left England he hadn’t
proceeded far through the document, but
he was convinced that this country had
gone too far.
Messages like these are exceedingly com-
mon and very ridiculous. If the British
economist would study Australia’s rocky
affairs more carefully he would find that
it will have to get a much more prohibitive
tariff than has been dreamed of yet, or else
go broke and become a wreck on the floor
of the loan market, a culmination which
would be unpleasant for all parties.
In this connection it may be noted that
J. Bull, despite his deep-rooted Cobdenism
and Adam-Smithism, does a little in the
way of Protection himself now, and but for
Baldwin’s rash promise to let the matter
rest for this Parliament he might do more.
Next Parliament he probably will. The
United Kingdom safeguards its sugar-
refining industry (ss. 7d. to 11s. Bd. per
cwt., according to quality), clocks and
watches (33A p.c.), lace, embroidery and
similar fluff (the same), wireless apparatus
(the same), motor-cars, bicycles, tricycles
and accessories (the same), cutlery (the
same), musical and scientific instruments,
records and accessories (the same), articles
made wholly or in part of silk or artificial
silk (the same), gloves (the same), syn-
thetic chemicals (the same), optical glasses
and optical instruments and parts (50 p.c.).
Then it protects beer, hops (£4 per ton),
spirits, almost every kind of article, includ-
ing jam, which contains sugar, and a con-
siderable number of sundries including
tobacco and matches. In fact, the Old
Man is practising a little as a Protectionist
and getting his hand in, though he tries
to conceal the fact from himself lest the
shock might be too much for himself in
his weak state.

Why Labor Polls So Well.
The Australian is not groaning under the
foot of a tyrant, and the Australian is not
a fool; yet, in spite of all the criticism
there is of the Labor party, both Federal
and State, by a good many more than
Nationalists, it polls well nearly always. At
the last N.S.W. State election Labor, of
course, was beaten, but in spite of all the
discontent in its own ranks the aggregate
vote was very high and only the Farmers'
party saved the Government.
The reason is probably resentment, pos-
sibly largely subconscious, at the spirit of
detachment shown by the Nationalist
leaders, both State and Federal. The Aus-
tralian is a live person, as a nation he is
practically 100 per cent, literate, and he
wants to know what is doing and what is
likely to be done. The Nationalist leaders
treat him with that superior air that might
be shown by a managing-director to a
junior clerk. The Labor leader, on the
other hand, makes some real show of treat-
ing the voter as a co-partner; he tells him
of the heights to be scaled and the diffi-
culties to be overcome, and the Aussie rises
to it, just as he did in the war. English
officers who captained Australians during
the S. African War, or the bigger thing of
1914, found that if they consulted their
men and told them what their objective
was they won their confidence and co-
operation. They treated them differently
from the English troops and it paid. The
Nationalist leaders treat the Australian as
if he did not want to know, and, even if
he did, that it is not his concern.
The Bulletin recently said “The Prime
Minister is at his best when, the Govern-
ment is under fire.” It is then that he
stirs up admiration and invites confidence.
But his common attitude is quite different;
and unless this superior detachment, this
indifference to the psychological make-up
of the Australian, is abandoned, it is doubt-
ful if a Nationalist Ministry will be returned
in any State or in the Federal House,
unless fortune is kind and provides some
convenient scare at an opportune moment.

Coffin Ships.
The recent conviction in Britain of W atkin
James Williams, a Welsh shipowner, for
sending out two steamers in an unseaworthy
condition, with the result that one of them
foundered with a loss of 23 lives in a
North Atlantic gale, will be welcomed by all
those whose job takes them to sea, as
well as those who desire to see a flagrant
scandal wiped out.
When Samuel Plimsoll succeeded in
having the load-line mark which bears his
name made compulsory by the Merchant
Shipping Act, it was hailed as the dawn of
the Millennium, as far as the seafarer was
concerned. But though, with its modern
additions, it has saved many thousands
of lives, its safeguards are too often obser-
ved rather in the letter than the spirit;
and indeed their very existence serves at
times as a shelter for men who are pre-
pared to do all that the law allows. The
familiar circle on the ship’s side with the
horizontal line through the middle indicates
the summer freeboard in salt water. It is
supplemented by lines showing the free-
board in fresh water, “Indian summer,”
“Indian winter” and “North Atlantic win-
ter.” The last is the lowest line of all, which
means that for the worst conditions the
ship is allowed most freeboard. But many
ships are sent out into bad-weather con-
ditions loaded down to marks intended to
apply to entirely different conditions, with
the result, as with the Eastway in the case
previously referred to, that many lives have
been sacrificed. We have had far too much
of the same sort of thing in Australia. It
is only a few years since two modern coastal
liners foundered with all hands in gales
which older craft rode out, one on the east
coast of Australia and the other on the
west. Later,- an old steamer designed for
tropical waters was permitted to leave Syd-
ney for the Islands, and went down with
loss of life off Newcastle. A year or so
ago, between Brisbane and Rockhampton, a
coastal cargo-carrier dived under in calm
weather and took most of her personnel
with her. In between and round about
these happenings the little colliers which
ply between Sydney and Newcastle or the
South Coast, with their often open
hatches awash, have been contributing
periodically to Davy Jones’s locker, usually
with the customary human sacrifice.
The fact that the Plimsoll mark is not
a fixture for all conditions ought to throw
at least a moral responsibility upon owners
and agents. If they take, under threatening
conditions, all that it is legal for them
to take under the best conditions, then,
even if the law cannot reach them, public
reprobation should. If it became prime
facie disgraceful for a ship to be lost at
sea —disgraceful, that is, to the owners—
the losses would be far fewer than they
are.

Should the G.P. Do His Own Surgery?
“Dr. Nil”: What "Quack” said about this
matter was partly right (B. 17/11/’27). What
“Another Quack” said in reply was all
right (B. l/12/’27). And this is what I
have to say after 40 years of general prac-
tice.
Every medical student, during his cur-
riculum, gets a chance of becoming a fair
average surgeon, unless the curriculum is
a rotten one. Many of these students, after
qualifying, are put on hospital resident
staffs, and expected to do any emergency
major surgery without assistance. If they
are not capable of this duty they are a
fraud imposed by the medical authorities
upon the patients and the public. As a
matter of fact, the great majority of them
are perfectly capable.
Some are born to surgery; some achieve
surgery; some have surgery thrust upon
them. Amongst the specialists in surgery
are not a few of the last class, and amongst
the country doctors of South Australia are
many of the second. I have not had the
pleasure of meeting the “born” surgeon yet.
I know what sort of surgery is being done
in the country towns of S.A. because, having
been obliged to cease practice on my own
account owing to ill-health, I have been
“relieving” for the last four years, and there
is no better way of seeing the inside of
other men’s work. And I am able to say
that what with good teaching, modern
aseptic methods, and the fact that they
usually have time for care and deliberation,
the genera] run of G.P.’s are quite well able
to do most of the commoner major opera-
tions described in the books both safely
and satisfactorily. It is true that in my
father’s time, and in that of my grand-
father, surgery was such a risky business
that only the elect dared to touch it. But
I have seen my son do, in a “bush” hospital,
operations that my father would have sent
to a London specialist.
The “big” men need not get breezy, how-
ever; there are always lots of people who
would rather pay £lOO than £2O for getting
their appendices out.

Who Killed Bonds?
Dear Bulletin, —Your lucid article (B.
8/12/’27) does not touch on one aspect of
Bonds’ failure. There has been lots of
talk about cheap foreign goods, but no
one has asked a question of that vast army
of good spenders who are well provided
with clothing needs and buy their stock-
ings by the half-dozen. These powerful
purchasers condemn Australian stockings in
three words—“ They don’t fit.” It is use-
less to erect fine factories, to fill them
with costly machinery, to secure preference
and to advertise widely without consulting
the taste of the final purchaser. Women
are adamant in matters affecting then-
appearance, and nothing on earth will in-
duce them to wear stockings which bag and
wrinkle easily at the ankle, and which almost
need a steam winch to keep them hauled
up taut and smooth; and these are the two
outstanding faults of Australian stockings
to date.
Meantime we have the spectacle of Bonds
in distress, and our papers showing whole-
page ads. for foreign stockings costing up
to two pounds a pair.—Yours, etc., Eliza.
Forget It!
Someone improved on Dr. Johnson’s
famous dictum by saying that Hell was so
full of people with good intentions that
their feet were sticking out of the windows.
Even so one can view the ultimate desti-
nation of the good folk who are endeavor-
ing to set up an aboriginal State in some
undefined section of Northern Australia.
The idea started in Adelaide a couple of
years ago. Since then money has been col-
lected, an organisation formed and political
pressure brought to bear to accomplish the
aims of the league. Briefly, the notion is
to carve out a reservation in Northern Aus-
tralia where the remnants of this country’s
aboriginal population shall be brought
together and trained to constitute a self-
governed abo. State.
It is a fine ideal at the bottom of it. But
its promoters have fallen into the old error
of supposing that, because all aboriginals
are black, and classified as a group apart
from the white man, they must necessarily
think and live as a homogeneous people.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
The thousand divisions of caste and custom
from the Leeuwin to Cape York have made
the aboriginal population of Australia one
of the most strangely diversified collections
of units of a single race which the world of
anthropology knows. Nowhere more than
in the Australia of the aborigines are the
“crimes of Clapham chaste in Martaban.”
Yet it is this curiously diversified race, some
of it yet in the Stone Age, as in Arnheim
Land, and some of it all too sophisticated
by the touch of civilisation, that the South
Australian philanthropists desire to throw
together into one melting-pot. The result of
such a scheme could be nothing but ruinous
failure, with elements of tragedy tacked on
to it.
It remains for the press and public of
South Australia to divert the ardor and cash
of the philanthropists into channels more
likely to benefit our black brother.

A Cry from the U.S.A.
From the president of the Immigration
Study Commission of America:—
Statistics show your Commonwealth, after
Canada, practically leading the world in
speed in filling your vacant spaces. Your
population, according to Dr. East of Har-
vard, doubles in 34 years. Japan doubles
only in 64 years. France, in 436 years.
It is evident you can fill up all your
vacant spaces suitably. Have you therefore
not a deep spiritual responsibility to your
forebears, the splendid Nordic-British, who
alone could have wrested your territory from
a none-too-complaisant natureV Do you
need really immigration from areas with
coolie-wage conditions.
Where color difference exists you are in-
stinctively alert. In the case of immigrants
from non-Nordic Europe, however, folks are
prone to be indifferent. Yet the danger to
your institutions is greatest from these.
So deeply does America feel it that,
by a succession of immigration restric-
tion acts, she has cut the quota of Italians,
for example, from approximately 250,000
to 3675 annually. Our experience showed
that even the second and third gen-
erations are not Americanised, that these
non-Nordics tend to herd into colonies.
There, by mass-force, they try to maintain
the customs of their native lands, and thus
weaken those institutions which are your
and our common heritage from Britain.
Mixing races destroys race purity. One can-
not unscramble eggs.
America, by her Quota Act. is trying to
conserve her Nordic blood. Has not your
Dominion a similar world responsibility?

Part of the St. Peter’s (Sydney) C. of E
cemetery is being resumed for road-widening
purposes. During the city’s short history
this is the tenth instance of wholesale dis-
interment, and shows the advantages of
cremation in at least populous centres. The
demand for outlet on the part of growing
populations can generally be relied upon to
elbow the inhabitants of the cemetery to
places further afield. During the next half-
century the prospect is that some of the
remains will have been removed three or
four times. The Acts of Parliament which
give the resurrection authorities the right
to raise the dead always stipulate that dili-
gence must be exercised in the collection
and identification of the remains; but there
is more diligence than accuracy. Mark
Twain said that if the dead got out of
their graves and read their epitaphs they
would think they were buried in the wrong
place. They would probably have very
good grounds for the reflection after, say,
the fourth general camp-shifting. And cre-
mation offers such an easy, such a natural
and such a cleanly way out of it all.
♦ —:
Apparently the now mercifully ended Film
Commission has failed to discover the exist-
ence of an American film combine in Aus-
tralia. This is strangely reminiscent of a
commission appointed in 1914 to inquire
into the allegation that the American Meat.
Trust had gained a footing in Australia.
Though many Queenslanders were aware
that huge new works were being erected on
the Brisbane River under the supervision
of strangers with a strong nasal accent, and
though the new co.’s articles of association,
filed in Brisbane, showed the necessary list
of shareholders to contain the name of one
of the most famous firms in Chicago—the
balance was made up of the solicitor con-
ducting the registration and several of his
clerks—the Good Old Commission found
that the thing was a figment of the imagi-
nation. That done, it wasn’t long before
the new firm came out in its true colors,
and continues so to this, day—though it
is really non-existent if a royal commis-
sion’s finding is worth a tinker’s dam.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The latest row from Canberra is because
what arc, called tariff-touts have appeared
there and have actually buttonholed mem-
bers. But why not? Do members know
everything there is to know about every
industry that is or might be?
The N.S.W. Government promises, after
Parliament reassembles in April, 1928, to
effect radical amendments in the Unfair
Rents law, and make the building of small
houses for letting purposes possible again. It
is satisfactory to know that the pledges of the
Bavin Government are pretty reliable, but
it would be a good thing if it would break
this one to the extent of doing the job in
February instead of April. Unemployment
is everywhere, and it is a pity to add to it
by encouraging the Legislature to loaf at
street corners for four months.
Walter West, shire sec. of Traralgon, re-
gained the South Gippsland seat for the Vic.
State Nationalists, beating Laborite Buckley
by 680 on the last count. Labor expected
a victory when Buckley got 356 S first pre-
ference votes, as compared with 2126 in
April, and was staggered to see the almost
solid way in which the supporters of Morley,
the Cocky candidate, gave their second pre-
ference to West. The result is an unpleasant
reminder to the Hogan Government that it
commands only 28 votes in a House with 65.
The U.S. Shipping Board has complained
to Congress that Australia gives tariff pre-
ference to British goods which come through
Canada and not to those which travel via
the United States, and thus favors- British
Empire shipping as against Yankee vessels.
Some other Australian regulation which is
said to work the same way is also objected
to, and though Australia has refused to
budge the proper U.S. department is Going
To See This Put Right. President Coolidge
has also complained to Congress about the
size of the British navy. The Empire seems
to be in for a hot time.
Westralia (pop. 385,000) has hitherto had
six salaried Ministers, the same as South
Aus. (pop. 570,000), but a bill increasing
the number to eight whizzed through the
Perth Parliament the other day. So Milling-
ton (Leederville) and Cunningham, from
the goldfields, are now among the happy band
of brothers. Five industrious Cabineteers and
a couple of honoraries would suffice for the
Perth Government’s job, but something has
to be done to keep up the fiction that the
most prosperous State in Australia really
needs the lavish grants it is getting from
Bruce and Page.
The seven Commonwealth ships are to be
offered for sale on condition that the buyers
keep them on the British register, and main-
tain (for how long isn’t yet stated) an
equally good or better service to Australia.
As the marine unions have threatened to
make things boiling hot in these waters for
these ships when sold and for all the buyers'
other vessels, this is a splendid chance to buy
trouble, and offers are likely to be few and
low. On the face of things it should be
easier to sell the ships unconditionally to
Smith, and then arrange for a new and
equivalent service, if one seems necessary,
with Brownjones.
It required an all-night sitting to smash
the Tote Bill through committee in Vic.
Assembly, with an amendment allowing
women to patronise the machine. From an
hour before midnight until lunch-time the
debate waged. Nominally Prendergast was
in charge, but Premier Hogan was very
much in evidence, and, sure of his numbers
on the main things (Whip Jewell was very
diligent), he kept on. Towards the end of
the debate he left Tunnecliffe in charge while
he with his nair (Opposition-leader McPher-
son) went off to open a stove factory at
Footscray.
The dissipated Crown Prince of Roumania,
who abandoned his Crown Princess and his
claim to the succession and bolted with a
strange female, seems to have a fair chance
to get back, or start a civil war, or some-
thing. He may return in time to be a
Christmas Carol.
THE EXPLANATION.
“The new comet discovered from Melbourne is, according to the astronomers, of erratic habit.”
It is now evident that the visit of British
Minister Amery was an ear-biting expedition,
the object being to get still better terms for
the British exporter to whom this country
has already given so much ; and he met with
great success. More British duties were
reduced than were increased, and John
Bull’s preference was extended. Moreover, the
absurd action of Customs-Minister Pratten in
cutting the iron and steel duties below the
Tariff Board’s recommendation is already
held responsible for the diversion of a huge
railway order from Newcastle, the British
tender winning by a narrow margin. Still
there is a roar of disapprobation and inci-
vility from British papers and Chambers of
Commerce because John 8., who already, in
most years, sells here more than lie buys,
doesn’t get bigger favors.
Time is of little account in arbitration
courts. Judge Beeby (Federal) was re-
cently occupied for an hour with an applica-
tion that a man (only one) employed in
“heating screw couplings and running a nut
up and down while the iron was hot” should
be classed as a blacksmith instead of a
blacksmith’s striker. The answer was in
the negative. At the same time Chief Judge
Dethridge declined to order that when a
carrier wanted an article shifted a member
of the Storemen and Packers’ Union should
do the shift. He also refused to rule that
one unionist should pack the cart while the
driver looked on, and then that the driver
should start the vehicle while his ex-colleague
watched him go.
In the course of a session of 21 working
days N.S.W.’s Bavinshaw Government got
rid of the Sydney Municipal Council and
Meat-Boarder Kay; suspended the collection
of the disastrous Child Endowment tax;
modified the erratic autocracy of Piddington ;
stopped the steal of the Roads fund, and
did other creditable deeds here and there.
And it borrowed three millions in London
for three months, having inherited there a
financial cupboard without even a bacon-
rind in it. The normal condition of the
Ma State is to have an overdraft in London
except occasionally just after a loan; this
time, apparently, the overdraft was top-
heavy and long-dated money was scarce and
dear. So recourse was had to a stopgap
transaction in Treasury bills, which is the
device of the man who pays for his lunch
by the deposit of his umbrella, and goes out
to see his uncle about the redemption monoy.
It was discovered a few weeks ago that.
Shannon had been carrying on as second
Vic. Railway Commissioner since April 9,
1926, without authority, somebody having
forgotten to have the necessary Executive
Council order passed. The re-appointment
was made at the end of last month and dated
back to April, 1926, but lawyers have cx-
pressed the opinion that there will have to
be validating legislation. The rank and file
are wondering whether Clapp will cite this
piece of forgetfulness in his next “Do It
Now circular.
if our Arbitration system is to be retained
Governments will have to devise and enforce
penalties for the insolent contempt of law in
which unions like the Waterside Workers’
Federation periodically indulge with im-
punity. These measures are necessary for
the safety of the State since (as one great
branch of the English-speaking people found
last century) persistent and unpunished
lawbreaking on the part of a large section
may lead to civil war. Imprisonment is out
of the question where offenders are num-
bered by the thousand, and substantial
fines, which some suggest, would be a
burden on the women and children.
But disfranchisement of the lawbreakiug
unionists for the period of one general elec-
tion (Federal or State as the case might be)
is practicable and would have a chastening
effect, particularly on the officials, who all
want to get into Parliament or exercise poli-
tical power in some way.
The Federal Government owns four rail-
ways, including the five-mile infant in the
Canberra territory, and the published
accounts continue to be mysterious. For
instance:—
Cost, with Interest
Rolling Stock. Interest. Per Cent.
Port Augusta-
Kalgoorlie .. £7,614,277 £117,547 £1 10 1
Oodnadatta . . 2,854,801 106,804 3 14 10
N. Territory.. 1,750,772 93,272 6 6 7
Canberra .. 82,945 1,0 79 1 6 0
For the previous year the interest charged
against the Canberra railway was at the
rate of ss. Id. per cent., so there is no lack
of variety. As regards the big three, the
completed line (Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie)
paid, for 1926-27, £31,326 over and above
working expenses, tvhile of the two un-
finished or dead-end lines the Oodnadatta
one lost £6574 and the N.T. one lost £2242.
Both show great improvement—quite enough
to justify the Government in changing the
whole affair to standard gauge and putting
some real energy into the business.
The burden of President Coolidge’s mes-
sage to Congress was that the U.S. has
“foreign commerce and ocean lines of trade
unsurpassed by any other country,” and
therefore, in effect, it must keep up with
Britain in naval matters. Britain’s refusal
to disarm further was alluded to with
severity. J. Bull’s islands could hardly stand
a two-months’ blockade, while the U.S. could
live on its own resources for a century, and
J.B. has 106 times as much oversea
territory to protect as Uncle Samuel has.
But Uncle turns a blind eye to these con-
siderations and his other eye is hard and
hostile. The President also remarked that
the U.S. is “doing good” and “walking
humbly,” and that it has exhibited an “un-
precedented attitude of generosity.” It is
well to know these things.
The proposal to reduce the Federal land-
tax on “big estates” valued at £5OOO and
over roused Deputy Labor-leader Scullin to
move:—
That in view of the grave and expanding obliga-
tions of the Commonwealth, and of the urgent need
for the subdivision of large estates to increase pro-
duction and to meet the keen demand for land,
reduction of land taxation is not justifiable.
On a continent where 90 per cent, of the
soil is still public property and 43 per cent,
unoccupied property there may be land
famine close to the overgrown cities, but it
can’t exist everywhere. As 10 years (1916-
26) of industrious “settlement” led to there
being, by official estimate, about 55.000
fewer people engaged in cultivation, one isn’t
sure that there is a keen desire to stay on
the land. And, anyway, the Federal land-
tax revenue is mostly derived from town and
city allotments, including “great estates”
with 20ft. frontages, which can’t be cut up.
Geelong has thrown off all its former
shyness and is now so persistent in assert-
ing its claims that an exasperated Labor
Minister said: “There are only two places
in Victoria, and Geelong is both.” And yet
it is a long time since the Pivot furnished a
Minister. The last one, Plain, drew only
a fortnight’s salary; his (the Elmslie)
Ministry toppled after 13 days in December,
1913. His predecessor was Gurr, who lasted
from 1900 to 1902, though not exactly a
success.
Victorian law is a stranger to ferocity.
It lately assessed at 20s. the case of a man
who drove his car on the wrong side of the
road and knocked dow T n a girl, but three
young men at Bendigo met with somewhat
sterner treatment. Their various offences
were entering a hotel after hours, perform-
ing so violently that the landlord called on
six boarders for protection, undressing i:i
the street, chasing young women who fled
in terror from their unclothed pursuers,
carrying on a Satanic revelry for 90 minutes
and using bad language which the belated
constable heard while 250 yards distant.
The Court put on its most bloodcurdling
expression and made it £5.
J. Bull is embittered because his adverse,
balance of trade keeps many of his people
unemployed, though he lacks the nerve to
improve the situation by vigorous tariff
action. The small and postponed Australian
duty on hosiery has made some sections in
England especially wrathful. Still John
spends over £2,000,000 on imported legwear,
chiefly Yankee, and sacrifices his own market
while hunting for ours.
KNIGHTLY DOINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“By 25 votes to 23 the Yic. Assembly removed
the prohibition against women betting on the totali-
sator contained in the original bill. One excited
speaker stigmatised the provision as ‘an insult to
noble womanhood.’ ”
Sister, they sought to do your sex a hurt,
To fix a stigma on your blouse and skirt;
To bar you from the crowds that soon shall
swell
And surge around the pari-mutuel;
To rob you of a free-born Briton’s right
A modicum to wager, or a mite,
On what to him or her appeareth good—
A wanton slur upon your womanhood.
No Lady Astor here might plead your cause
And heap a woman’s scorn on man-mads
laws,
No Preston Stanley make.it her affair—
I doubt if either would had she been there.
Yet to your rescue bounded knightly lads
As chivalrous as old-time Galaliads,
And equally insistent to redress
The wrongs of dames and damsels in distress.
In burning words that flew across the floor
The flimsy sophistry in shreds they tore
That the machine whereon your brothers
blew
(Or will) their brass were best debarred to
you.
They bore them back, still fighting grimly,
those
Who sought unjust distinctions to impose,
Who unto war co-winners grudged to give
The chance on fields of peace to win a div.
Sister, in many a once-forbidden sphere
You sit to-day, man’s equal and his peer.
Shame on the band who banned by voice
and vote
Your woman’s right to elbow at the tote
Him whom you jostle, be you maid or wife,
In nearly every other walk of life!
Here’s to your paladins, a knightly pack—
Next, I suppose, they’ll tell you what to
back!

“Strict Veg.”: Frank Webster, of “The
Student Prince” company, got mixed up in
a typical stage situation in real life the
other day. He was motoring with his wife
and a friend to Black Bock (Vic.) for a
game of golf, when a dishevelled and blood-
stained man rushed out of a side street and
clamored to be saved from a person Avith a
gun who had threatened to shoot him. The
actor’s heart was touched by the story, so
he invited the terrified fellow to hop on and
accelerated for half a mile. Then the sup-
posed victim of the aggression said, “This
will do, thanks,” jumped off and disappeared.
Later the obliging motorist was confronted
by an angry man with two bullet-wounds in
the head who asserted that the escapee had
attempted to murder him. He had a gun, it
is true, but it was the other fellow’s!

“C.Q.”: The “International Police Force,”
whose picturesque arrival in Melbourne was
reported a few months
ago in The Bulletin,
is gathering way. At
any rate it has gained
some Australian re-
cruits, and the fact
that some of its mem-
bers have faced a Syd-
ney police court on a
vagrancy charge may
invest them with a
halo of martyrdom.
The idea behind the
I.P.F. is beautifully
simple. A Yankee non-
entity conceived the
idea of raising a vast
constabulary on behalf
of the League of
Nations for the en-
forcement of world
peace. T hat body
turned the charlatan
down, but he was in
no way discouraged.
He has branches in
various parts of the
world to-day collecting
fees for him on a 25
p.c. commission basis.
The notion is so ridi-
culous that it is hard
to believe that any-
body could be induced
to subscribe. Yet a
member showed me a large book full ot
signatures and amounts donated. Some of
the hardest business heads in Melbourne had
been stung for a guinea.

“Ming”: “Queen competitions” (B.
8/12/’27) ? The man who did the organis-
ing for one of these events in our country
town confided to me, months afterwards, that
he reckoned himself lucky to have escaped
with a whole skin. There were 13 candi-
dates, and the ructions began with the first
sixpenn’ortli of votes recorded. The compe-
tition ran for three hectic months, and dur-
ing that time there was no manner of insult
the organiser was not called on to endure;
he still has a collection of anonymous letters,
most of them threatening, that would under-
mine the reputation of half the families in
the district. Two queens smacked his face,
not content with smacking one another’s; one
queen’s father threatened to horsewhip him
and two queens’ mothers came to blows on a
point of etiquette on his office floor. The
night the finals were announced he prudently
had a nervous breakdown and, escaping the
pageant that was billed for the following
night, returned to the city. There he spent
most of his organising fee in recuperating.

perience of “heaving the log.” I was en-

trusted with the lio.ur-glass, or the 28-second
glass. The officer of the watch cast the log-
ship over the stern, and when the 12 or .15
fathoms of “strayline” had run over the
taffrail, and the piece of leather that marked
the first knot appeared there, he yelled
“Turn!” I dutifully upended the glass, but
I was so interested in the proceedings of an
albatross which was apparently mistaking
the logship for something edible that our old
hooker had reeled off about 20 knots before a
biff on the ear reminded me that I had for-
gotten to yell “Stop” when the sand had run
out. Holding the reel aloft was no joke when
the ship was heeling over or diving into a
head sea; the ham-and-egg mariner on the
modern smoke-stack has something to be
grateful for in the patent log that saves him
from any exertion.

“Mundowie” : Storekeepers’ “shinplasters,”
mostly for 10s. and 205., used to be common
enough in the north-west corner of the Ma
S'tate (B. l/12/’27). They were not drawn
on any bank, and there was no sound
guarantee behind them, so they were no use
to anybody outside the district. I remem-
ber one man who liked to give his plasters
in exchange for cheques and good money, but
showed a certain displeasure when he was
paid with them. He seemed to think lie
was geting nothing for the goods. If any
got lost or destroyed in circulation, that was
the issuer’s profit, and he liked his currency
to be out taking risks. He would trot down
to the pub with a 20s. plaster, have a couple
of drinks, and jog back to the store with the
good change. But he felt like a ruined man
one day when the publican bought £2O worth
of groceries and paid for them with a pile
of the shopman’s own shinplasters. Bung
had saved them all with malice aforethought.

“Georjay” : The Nor'-West of W.A. wor-
ried along without banknotes for many a year
(B. l/12/’27). I remember when the first
bank opened at Port Iledland. Prior to that
the paper currency consisted of shinplasters
issued by a firm of local storekeepers; when
the bank opened what was left of such
negotiable instruments was deposited, after
being cancelled, in a barrel at the back of
the store, pending incineration. Some
natives, prowling around, discovered the
hidden wealth, and helped themselves liber-
ally thereto. They were the most disgusted
persons in Australia when they tried to cash
the paper.
“Murkah” : Speaking of lie-women or she-
men (B. l/12/’27), I can still remember a
glimpse I had, when a boy, of Bill-Marion
Edwards. That celebrity of other days pulled
up at our house dressed in masculine attire
and driving a hooded waggon, and fell into a
conversation with my mother on the sub-
ject of clothing. Presently it transpired that
Bill was Bill in all respects save one—sox.
There Marion came in. "If I wear trousers
till I die,” announced the freak, “I'll wear
stockings under them.”

“Oxmead” : A male impersonator who had
a six mouths’ run in W.A. some 1(3 years
ago was a young English girl who had been
a teacher in a school run by sisters of the
church at Kalgoorlie. The daring soul left
at the end of term and re-appeared at Fre-
mantle in masculine attire. The first job
that came her way was that of page-boy in
a club, where her deftness and quickness
soon won her good opinions. After that
she touched the fringe of several callings
without anyone having the slightest sus-
picion of her sex. She might have kept up
the deception longer had not her disappear-
ance from the school set worried relatives in
England inquiring. The police department
was invoked and some detective, brighter
than most, presently got on the girl-boy’s trail.
Shortly after reverting to skirts the young
lady married, after having enjoyed fuller
opportunities for sizing up the male of the
species at close range than falls to the lot
of most brides.

“Five Eight” : Touching these widely dif-
fering estimates about the speed of the
Tahiti and the Greycliffe offered at the re-
cent inquiry. The engineer below in a ship
who has pressure gauges to hand is almost
the only one who can give a fairly reliable
estimate about a vessel’s speed. To a deck
officer working his ship in and out of port
such a computation is mostly guesswork.
Passing stationary objects and craft going in
the opposite direction will give the most
experienced seaman a false impression. Nor
should it be ignored that excessive slowness
can be as dangerous as excessive pace. A
single-screw ship steaming in the harbor
under five knots if called upon to act smartly
in case of emergency would probably not have
enough steamage way on to answer the helm.

“Centurion”: The news that a Swedish
military officer and liis wife have been
arrested for selling military secrets to the
Soviet is a reminder that the wages of
espionage are seldom commensurate with its
perils. This particular couple assert that,
though they were on the job for some months,
all they got was £6O. This bears out Basil
Thomson’s revelations of the German espion-
age system in Britain, as they appear in the
ex-Secret Service Chief’s book “Queer
People.” Thomson says that there were 30
established German resident spies scattered
all over Britain, each with a certain tail of
subordinates. Twenty-nine of these were
arrested a few hours before the declaration
of war in 1914, only one making his escape.
Investigation revealed that the average pay
of these “centres” was £2 a week, with a
very occasional bonus for a good coup. In
very few cases are such people actuated by
patriotism ; they are out for the plunder and
seem to be content with a very poor share
of it.

“X.D.” : The ways of the crook are past
fathoming. A Melbourne family recently
locked their house up for six months and
went to Paris. When they came back they
found everything untouched, yet a few days
later, while they were out for the evening,
the place was ransacked.

“C.Q.” : There is one man in Geelong (Vic.)
who continues to openly use a sprinkler
despite the water restrictions forbidding all
devices for damping the ground except the
humble watering-can. He is Dr. A. Sheppard
Grimwade. Foreseeing trouble he sank a
bore in his back yard, and struck a plentiful
supply at about 100 feet. He “divined” it
himself, too, with a switch cut from one of
his own trees.

“Sol. M.”: Sympathy for the-criminal is
a strange, mad passion in Melbourne. The
other day Molloy was charged with having
shot at Rice with intent to do grievous
bodily harm, and with unlawfully wounding.
He admitted without any reservation that he
shot Rice, whereupon the jury found him
not guilty on both charges. Judge Wasley
tried to say something adequate, but words
failed him. Demosthenes or Cicero might
have felt the same way.

“Whynot”: Unscheduled stops? Some
years back, when “staffs” were exchanged by
the drivers of trains and stationmasters, I
was a passenger on a slow “mixed” for
Townsville. All of a sudden the train
slackened pace where there was no sign of a
station, pulled up, and then began slowly to
retrace its way, with the fireman desperately
searching the grass on either side of the
track. Impatient questions elicited the in-
formation, couched in fiery language, that
the staff had disappeared during the last
three miles or so, and was suspected of
having fallen out. As it seemed that we
could not get into Townsville without it,
about 50 passengers tumbled out and aided
in the search. After a mile’s retreat the
staff was retrieved and we resumed our
journey amidst the cheers of a near-by gang
of fettlers.

“Chevroford”: The motorist running out
of Melbourne through Diggers’ Rest towards
Bendigo is reminded of the convict days by
the numerous great stone barracks) three
storeys high, with superintendent’s quarters
adjoining. He gets another reminder of the
same bad old thing which isn’t so casually
accepted. The Country Roads Board has
great respect for and has preserved
portions of the old prisoner-built cobblestone
road.
* * * *
“Bihai” : I don’t doubt that the concrete
portion of the Tulagi Gaol, which was
erected in 1909, will comfortably hold the
40 or 50 Malaita tribesmen who are to be
tried for murder (B. l/12/’27). It doesn’t
take stone walls to make a prison in Papua.
The average native has little, if any, objec-
tion to'- gaol,' with itsithree regular meals a day
as against two uncertain ones in his village,
a frequent tobacco ration, nothing heart-
breaking in the way of labor and a feeling
of security which he seldom knows in his
own community. There was a case in
Samarai (Papua) where the white gaoler
went on the scoot. His flock, returning in
the evening from work, couldn’t get in. They
formed search parties and found their cus-
todian—and the key of their cage. The
former they carried to his quarters and put
comfortably to bed before making themselves
safe for the night. And it wasn’t the
prisoners, either, who blew the gaff and got
the erring gaoler the sack.

“Two Seas” : The Uondon cat’s-meat man
(B. 8/12/’27), with his “Mee-Mee-Mee-yor!”
cry may be doomed to extinction with the
disappearance of the horse, but other of the
old cries will die harder. With his stock
in a wooden tray, covered by a piece of thick
green baize and balanced on his head, the
muffin-man still chants “Muffins and crum-
pets all ’ot.” The gypsy-looking derelict
with the home-made props and clothes-lines
may still be heard in the suburbs with his
shrill “Buy a prop, buy a line!” while his
consort turns her dark eyes upward to the
windows as she warbles, “Will you buy a
broom for the lady, or a little one for the
baby.” The man who used to chirrup the
news that he had green turves and ground-
sel for caged birds had to find some other
lay when the fields around Hampstead gave
place to bricks and mortar. But the plaster-
image merchant, generally an Italian, who
was advised by the drunken sailor, after he
had broken the arm of Napoleon, to “knock
his eye out and sell him as Lord Nelson”
still disturbs the peace of the quiet streets,
and the secondhand clothes-dealer still carries
his blue sack and his pyramid of cast-off lids
around the outskirts of the Big Smoke,
pausing occasionally to cry “Old clo’, old
do’ ” in the melancholy tones of a mopoke.
An attempt to abolish any of these ancient
institutions is always met with stern oppo-
sition, as was shown by the uproar over the
proposal to remove the flower girls from
Piccadilly Circus, where some of the “girls”
had occupied the same pitch for 50 years or
more.

“Kerys” : To Lord Liverpool, when Gover-
nor of Maoriland, belongs much of the credit
for shutting down on the infliction of long-
winded speeches on defenceless soldiers. It
was the custom at Auckland to collect the
returning soldiers as they left the troopship,
parade them in one of the big wharf sheds,
and keep them standing there while various
local celebrities and patriots delivered
lengthy and boring addresses on the war and
the noble part the Dominion had played in
it- There were many protests, but the
authorities persisted till the Governor took
the matter into his own hands. Arriving
The Binksons’ automatic man arrived
safely —
There was
nothing it
couldn’t do —•
and after an argument, pitched
Binkson out —
and proved a treasure.
But one day it succumbed
to Binkson’s whisky—
-t t aj d -
and quite put Mrs. B. m a
quandary.
THE AUTOMATIC MAN.
The papers report the invention of an automatic man which obeys words of command by the human
voice through the medium of wireless impulses.”
one hot morning, Lord Liverpool found
some hundreds of just-landed men, more or
less damaged, awaiting him with an air of
pained resignation. He mounted his dais
with a resolute air, and remarked, “Men,
welcome home.” Then he dismounted and
proceeded to other matters. He left a
gasping public and several lines of grinning
Diggers, but after that the elongated speech
of welcome was a thing of the past.

“R. 0.8.”: These are hard times for poets
—and poetesses. One of the latter, a young
country school-teacher, wrote some verses
about various Australian birds and for-
warded them to the Education Department
in the hope that some might be regarded as
suitable for insertion in the elementary
school readers. In one of the lady’s efforts
the crow was made to say “This lamb looks
weak, I’ll whet my beak.” After three
months’ wait this particular lyric came back
with the following official annotation:
“Statement regarding crow not approved.
Suggest lines be altered to show value of
crow as check to blowfly pest.”

“E.T.”: A hangman once presented me
with his visiting-card fB. 24/11/’27), quite
an artistic one, too. When James Berry was
selected in the face of some brisk competition
as England’s official scragger. I happened to
be in a hotel at Bradford, his native city,
There I saw the newly-appointed official
being welcomed home by some of his friends
and admirers, and was formally introduced
to him. Some months afterwards" I was
' again in Bradford, hurrying to the theatre
for a Christmas pantomime rehearsal, when
I was hailed by a man whose face I failed
to recognise. Seeing I had forgotten him, he
ostentatiously drew a credential from his
pocket and handed it to me. It was a highly-
colored Christmas card featuring robin-red-
breasts, a snow-clad church and other
emblems of the season of peace and goodwill.
Turning it over I read upon the back:
“James Berry, Public Executioner.”

“A.A.H.” : A Perth bottle-oh has found a
really practical use for the sort of pet that is
generally kept in a cage. His white cockatoo
accompanies him on his rounds and takes
its turn at shrilling out the slogan of the
calling. It is impossible to tell the voice
of the feathered assistant from that of its
master.

“Miro” : Though in a few cases the Maori-
laud civilian-officer clung to wartime rank,
most of them dropped back into private life
with silent celerity. The son of our village
butcher had attained the rank of major and
annexed sundry coveted decorations. I had
never seen the village hero, but a few days
after his return I called at the shop and
found a new and very expert young man re-
ducing suet to fragments with professional
skill. “Chop it as small as you can, Major,”
instructed the customer, and I realised I was
watching the possessor of a D.S.O. back on
his job again. But though I lived in the
village for five years after that I never again
heard his war-ranK mentioned in public.
* * * *
“Mephisto”: There is at least one resident
of Brisbane who regards the time-payment
system as a detestable invention. He is, or
was, a lover who presented his fiancee with
a pianola purchased in this manner. Later
they quarrelled and the swain broke off the
engagement. The lady did not offer to return
the instrument, so the gentleman asked for
it and received a pointed refusal. He then
threatened to cease payments and notify the
firm to re-possess itself of the pianola, but
the lady replied that if he did she would sue
for breach of promise, and pointed out that
the article in dispute would be a piece of
telling evidence. The young man is still pay-
ing instalments on a pianola he never sees
or hears.

“X.D.”; A Hobart bench of magistrates
had a case of cow-stealing to consider
recently. The accused, ’ who was charged
with stealing Strawberry in 1920, had been
captured in N. S. Wales only the other day.
It turned out that he had paid his bail and
the expenses of his extradition, also the
owner of the cow had died and the present
address of the animal concerned was not ou
record. So the verdict was that the long
arm of the law had over-reached itself for
once and that it was time to let bygones be
bygones.
* * * *
“Unity” : It isn’t only the juvenile house-
breaker who is liable to be puzzled by a
gold coin. A 16-year-old Sydney office-boy
the other day found a suspicious-looking item
in his pay-envelope. After gazing at it with
deepening suspicion he took it to the account-
ant. “That?” said the figure expert. “You
should be glad to get hold of one. It’s a
half-sovereign !” The boy had never before
seen one.
* * * *
' “Coot” : A novel suggestion as to the cause
of a fire which recently broke out in the
untenanted tower of Melbourne’s Working-
men’s College was put forward by the Fire
Brigade’s chief. The theory was that a
sparrow had picked up a wax match from
the street below and carried it to its nest,
and that the heat of the sun, beating on the
i)0-feet tower, had done the rest.
“Nikko”: Maoriland trains,
like Australian ones, sauntered
over the countryside in delight-
fully leisurely manner in the
old days. I recall one little
hamlet where the school-teacher
regularly travelled to the city on
Saturday morning. Once when
she didn’t appear a perturbed
s.m. sent one of his kids run-
ning up to the boarding-house
with a message that he could
only hold the train for five
minutes. Fortunately the re-
spite proved sufficient, Miss
Blank, who had obviously over-
slept herself, appearing at the
Inst moment with unlaced shoes,
minus a hat and carrying an
unwrapped water-melon under
her arm. But the person who
mostly benefited from the lei-
sured march of the country
train was an elderly man who
took small contracts for pasting
advertisements on country sta-
tions and adjacent buildings. He
would descend and get to work
immediately the train reached a
station, and I never saw him
unduly hurried, though occasion-
ally the guard had to mention
that it was a bit past starting-
time, and perhaps he’d better
postpone putting the ad. on the
village store until the return
trip.

“Iford”: The tin-hare con-
troversy rages in countries as
far apart in everything as Spain
and Australia. Cabled 'that
Prime Minister and near-dic-
tator of the former land has
barred the synthetic chase on
the ground, among others, that
it will interfere with the natu-
ral sport of real coursing—one
seems to remember that Don
Quixote included a lean grey-
hound among his scanty posses-
sions. Nevertheless, recent Lon-
don files suggest that whatever
the case against the new
“sport,” De Rivera’s apprehen-
sions are quite unfounded.
There is a. four-months’ close
season for the tin hare in the
English winter, and it is claimed
that dogs which have distin-
guished themselves'at the much-
boomed game return to the pur-
suit of the flesh - and - blood
quarry not only with undi-
minislied eagerness but with in-
creased proficiency. Meanwhile
in the N. S. Wales Assembly
last week it was seriously
argued by an ex-Labor Minister
that gambling on the speed of
dogs should not be suffered to
interfere with the vested attrac-
tions of horse- and pony-racing,
because the horse is a useful
animal and the dog is not!

“Long Un”: The swagman
■ who pulls up a motorist for no
better reason than to try and
cadge a bit of tobacco is more
likely to get a discourteous re-
buff. I know a wayfarer who
lias hit on a much more diplo-
matic opening. He plants his
swag behind a bush, pulls up a
driver—one with a pipe in his
mouth for preference—and asks
if the latter has seen a couple of bay horses
along the road. The driver hasn’t, and the
pedestrian bewails the fact that he has been
looking for the prads all day and has run
right out of tobacco. His method, he assured
me, has always worked, except on one lam-
entable occasion when he had the bad luck
to strike a man to whom he had told the same
tale a week before.
BLONDE AND BRUNETTE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
We’re vexed to distraction both early and
late
(We meaning the maidens for wedlock who
wait),
And what of the suitors who halt or demur?
Which type do they favor —what beauty
prefer ?
In recent romances you can’t but remark
That the fair are more highly esteemed than
the dark ;
Now there comes another who alters the tune
And says men like blondes but they marry
the brune.
It’s lovely to draw the glad eyes of a man
With the charms that we show and the lures
that we plan,
But lovelier by far if lie come with a ring
To hold us secure ere our youth’s on the
wing.
So blondes we must be to be sure of his
glance,
For if we can’t draw him we’ve never a
chance;
And then we must change if we’d fasten him
down
And bind him with tresses of raven or brown.
So be wise and take warning by Helen of
Troy,
The blondest of blondes and the creature of
joy;
She angled for Paris and caught him ere
long,
But “ Marry her!” No—for her color was
wrong.

And never a spar nor lasliin’
Is out of place. I write a cheque.
My bank-book is the only wreck.
Milady always fills her bag
When modes she goes a-hunting:
Though trailing them she’ll never fag,
There’s mercy in her, blunting
The keenest lust to slay a bill;
My credit is the only kill.
Milady’s clothes are hymns of praise,
Each day hears joyous matins
From harmonising blues and greys,
From singing silks and satins ;
And swift I close my rifled purse
And strangle a full-blooded curse!

“Morkrum”: Seven months ago an Aus-
tralian conosived a notion for rendering
the postal money-order system practically
fraud-proof. The • utmost he could have
hoped for here was a pound or so for the
suggestion—had it been adopted; accord-
ingly he sent it to his brother in the U.S.A.
and the sum of 500 dollars was
cheerfully paid for a very simple and practi-
cal idea. On the official advice (whether
posted or telegraphed) the sender writes a
question and answer. This query is put to
the receiver: Date of your birthday?—or
whatever it may be. Or there may be some
identification like this: “Payee’s left little
finger missing.” Since its adoption four
months ago the scheme has given excellent
results• America, of course, gets the credit.
“Zirk”: Undoubtedly wireless has saved
many lives at sea (B. 24/11/’27) ; had it
only come a year or two sooner some message
might have gone out into space from the
Koombana before she went down, somewhere
between Port Hedland and Broome (W.A.),
in 1912. But at that time very few ships
were fitted with wireless, and only two
stations in Australia had been opened, Sydney
and Perth. In 1913, a year after the dis-
aster, a station was opened at Broome and
vessels trading on the coast were fitted out
with transmitting and receiving apparatus.
The first Australasian-owned merchantsliips
to be equipped with wireless were the liiver-
ina, the TJlimaroa and the Zealandia, of the
Huddart-Parker line, in 1910.
“Mugwumpian”: Some old chaps indulge
in quaint hobbies. Binks, an old Moonta
identity, was accustomed to occupy himself
in applying to the King for every Australian
Governorship which fell vacant. The most
curious part of it was that he received
answers, which he would display with real
pride. There was no doubt of their genuine-
ness. They came . from the Colonial Secre-
tary’s office and invariably thanked Binks
on behalf of his Majdsty for his patriotic
offer to serve the Empire, while regretting
that it was not at present the policy of his
Majesty’s Government to recommend the
appointment of gentlemen in the dominions.

“Sol. M.” : An eminent London doctor has
proved that the bacilli of “one of the most
dreaded diseases” is good for 2(i years anyhow,
lie did it by burying the organisms in a test
tube, and waiting. On release, they promptly
killed a guinea-pig and seemed good for
another century or
several centuries. This
is another argument
for cremation, however
displeasing it may. be
to the reverend contro-
versialist of Auburn
(N.S.W.) who writes
so copiously on this
and every other sub-
ject to the S. M.
Herald. After all,
burial is a wormy de-
vice, practised by
ancient .Tews and
ancient pagans, and
old Fossil Man and
his fossil wife incluued
it among their nasty
habits before the use
of fire was known. As
the world fills up it
becomes more objec-
tionable, owing to the
difficulty of getting
far enough away from
the remains.

“F.S.H.”: Touch-
ing this controversy
about the German
raider Wolf (B.
l/12/’27), I am told
—and my informant
was on the patrol that
searched Bunker Head
for the elusive sea-
plane—that when the
raider was seen pass-
ing slowly up the
coast the only armed
vessel in Port Jackson
was the old Franklin.
At this stage someone
in authority hit on the
idea of burning green
coal in some old hulks,
the volume of smoke
being intended to de-
lude the Wolf’s skip-
per into believing
there was a small fleet
in the harbor getting
up steam. The dodge
worked, I am assured; the Wolf left in a
hurry, and Sydney never realised how close
it had been to getting a taste of war.

to the same authority the Chow is the only

opposed to fact. Admittedly the colored man
handles far too much of our trade, but there
are white storekeepers and restaurateurs
who could have supplied all “Kelby’s”

years I claim to know more about it than

through Torres Strait (B. l/12/’27) The
narrowest part of the passage is 100 miles
Point to point, so that it would be pos-
sible for a whole squadron to make the trip
without anyone on Thursday Island (or
Papua) seeing it. In any case it is more
than doubtful whether the Wolf passed
through Torres Strait. According to her
own skipper’s book, she went in the opposite
direction after leaving southern waters, and
intercepted the Makambo between Woodlark
Island and Rabaul on a course exactly oppo-
site that which would lead her to Torres
Strait. As to the story of the German
plane flying over Sydney, the evidence of a
dozen competent witnesses, most of them
navigating officers of captured ships, is all
against it; they are agreed that the ’plane
was dismantled while the privateer was on
the south coast of Australia.

“M.G.S.” : If any Australian operator, in
the Commonwealth or private cable service,
had been caught paraphrasing overseas
cables and radios during the war, as
“Kwinana” alleges this class was instructed
to do when the spy fever was at its height
(B. 24/11/’27), 1 guarantee he would have
got the sack. Only the censors were
empowered to mess about with telegrams.
The operator's job was to transmit the things
correctly and see that the number of words
agreed with _ the charge. The Chief Censor
and liis assistant once called on me in an
Australian capital and asked me, in taking
a certain telegram, to bluff the sender that it
contained two more words than was actually
the case and charge him for the same.
Their motive for wanting to add two words
to the wire was a good illustration of the;
imbecilities in which censors habitually in-
dulged. The cable was addressed to Prime
Minister Asquith, Lord Haig and other
notabilities, and was a rambling resolution
about Home Rule passed at a meeting of
Australian Irish. The censors were afraid
that the message, as it stood, might under-
mine our leaders’ determination to win the
war, but they were more afraid of the de-
vastating tongue of the red-haired Hibernian
who brought it.

“Cuchulain”: There are accidents so
queer that their very nature can only be
dimly guessed at. In the Lismore (N.S.W.)
district a lad of 17, a recent arrival from
England, was sent to bring in two calves,
lie never returned ; searchers found him un-
conscious and at the point of death. Appa-
rently he had tied the animals together with
a rope. Either the calves turned round
quickly, twisting his knees in the rope, or
he may have been attending to a boot. Any-
how the indications went to show that they
had knocked him over and the back of his
head had struck the ground with sufficient
force to fracture his skull. The calves were
too young for either playfulness or savagery.

“Rob P.”: Brisbane cops are speculating
as to what sort of a job they are going to
have enforcing the Firearms License Bill,
which will shortly become law, seeing that
it is an unarmed force which is expected to
wrest forbidden weapons from the under-
world. In the other State capitals the police
are armed as a matter of course, but a Bris-
bane officer of the law can only use a revol-
ver at his own risk and without the protec-
tion of his official position. In fact, Queens-
land is the one State which jibs at shoulder-
ing full responsibility for the effective enforc-
ing of its laws.

“Murkah” : Marriage is responsible for far
more changes of creed than any direct pro-
selytising. Thomas Moloney was an Irish-
man and a Catholic, with as neat a farm as
any in the district. His son Denis took up
with a nice young Protestant lady, who
“turned.” A year or two afterwards Thomas
Moloney and his wife departed this life; later
son Denis followed them. Next a Presby-
terian parson cast wistful eyes on the ex-
Prot. lady and in due course marriage event-
uated. Now, her son, Denis Moloney, and
their son, Alexander Murray, both attend the
Presbyterian kirk, and the ex-parson farms
the Moloney selection.
WHEN CAPTAIN SIMPSON CAME
ASHORE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the sailormen’s old stories
Of the half-forgotten glories,
The rivalries and triumphs
Of the sailing-clipper days,
When they made the famous chantey
Of the good ship Rosinante—
Who “came driving up the Channel
Till the spray becomes a haze” —
In these ancient yarns and stirring
There's a mention keeps recurring
Of a wondrous Captain Simpson
And his more than wondrous ways.
Talk of spuny’n, beer or spices,
Skippers’ tyrannies and vices,
Porto Rico, Punt’ Arenas,
Any sea or any shore,
It’s an even-money wager—
That at last some bearded stager
Will remark, “Now, that reminds me
Of when Simpson came ashore.”
I have questioned fo’c’s’le sages,
Grizzled tars, all types and ages,
For the nature of the exploits
W hicli endowed him with such fame ;
Where the vessel was located
When those deeds were perpetrated
That have wreathed this deathless glamor
Round this doughty skipper’s name.
I have sat for hours together
Through discussions on the weather
Experienced in the ’sixties—
Never since, though, or before—
Hoping that, as potent liquor
Made tough shellbacks’ eyelids flicker,
I might glean authentic tidings
Of what Simpson did ashore.
I’d die happy, could I ever
Reap the fruits of my endeavor
To elucidate the mystery
Of the Captain’s fabled deeds;
Then, at Peter’s awful portal.
I might say, “I was the mortal
Who wrote the ‘Life of Simpson’
That everybody reads.”
But the sailormen’s old stories
Never specify the glories,
Tim eppers and the frolics
To be laid at Simpson’s door ;
MIGHT GIVE HIM A FEW POINTS.
Couldn’t I kiss you good night? Nobody would be any the
wiser!”
“I—l flatter myself that you would be.”
None has ever yet reported
In what haven he cavorted;
Though I purchase ale unstinted,
Rums and whiskies by the score,
Nought will render them explicit,
And I always seem to miss it....
What was it Captain Simpson did
The night lie came ashore?

The absorption of the Western Australian
Bank dominates the movements in last year's
figures. The Wales bought the business, as
from March 28, for £875,01X1 in fully-paid
shares, equal to £2,012,500 on the basis of
the market value of the purchaser’s scrip at
the time the offer was made. At September
30, 1020, the W.A. Bank had a paid capital
of £700,000 and reserves which it valued in
its books at £1,310,850; together £2,010,850.
Thus the Wales, which had looked askance
at mergers and absorptions for 109 years, at
once acquired a substantial business with a
considerable goodwill at a very satisfactory
figure. One immediate result has been to
move the Wales from fourth to an easy first
place as a deposit holder amongst the asso-
ciated banks in Westralia. At the same time
shareholders in the vendor bank gained a
wider security and improved their immedi-
ate return and their prospects. The reserves
and undivided profits taken over have been
entered by the Wales in its books at
£865,851, and £265,000 of that has been
transferred to the provident and pension
funds and capital account, the latter lo bal-
ance the purchase consideration. No doubt
the Wales, which has grown strong on a
traditional diet of caution, considered that
its old Westralian friend had been not quite
as conservative as it might have been so
a tidy sum has been whisked away to inner
reserves.
During the year paid capital ( £7,423,410 at
September 30) increased by £1,423.440, of
which £548,440 was on account of a new
par issue, the balance representing the pur-
chase consideration of the W.A. Bank. Dis-
closed net earnings for the past 12 months
were £100,508 greater than the combined net
profits of the two banks in 1926 and repre-
sented 17.3 p.c. on average capital compared
with 18.3, 16.3, 14.1 and 13.8 p.c. back to
1923. For the 1926 term the W.A. Bank
netted 16.6 p.c. on its capital. Shareholders
for the third time in succession received an
extra 2 \ p.c. with the final div., but a “not
to be regarded as permanent” label was
attached. Nevertheless the 124 p.c. was an
easy matter, leaving 27.7 p.c. ""of the year’s
net earnings in the business, and that made
visible reserves equal to £l5 13s. Sd. per £2O
share, which the market values at £45. The
buyer at that figure gets 54 p.c. on his
purchase as long as last year's rate of dis-
tribution continues, or 4.4 p.c. on a 10 p.c.
div. basis, and, of course, he has prospects.
All new share issues since 1912 have been
at par.
In the next table the general prosperity of
recent years, partly real and partly arti-
ficial, is reflected in the growth of deposits :

The spring in last year’s deposit figures
was mainly the result of transfers from the
W. A. Bank. The increase over the com-
bined figures of the two institutions in 1926
is only £36,288, and that is because the
growth in ordinary current account and fixed
deposits was nearly offset by a decrease of
£1.600,000 in Government-controlled de-
posits. Acceptances show little movement,
but the note circulation sprang £Bl,OOO-odd,
of which £70,000 was on account of Maori-
land business, the balance ( £11,000) repre-
senting a legacy from Westralia. The
advances business continues to grow faster
than deposits, despite efforts to arrest the
movement. It cannot continue much longer;
the whole scale of public and private expen-
diture must be overhauled :

Of the £5,391,000 increase in advances
last year £4.200,000 was on account of the
Westralian business, the balance being well
spread amongst the other States and Maori-
land. The W.A. purchase also accounts for
all but £20,000 of the £220,000 increase in
the book value of premises.
Total liquids were £1.040,755 less than
the combined figures a year ago. due largely
to the heavy Government withdrawals re-
ferred to above:—

Nevertheless the financial position was com-
fortable. At Sept. 30, 42.4 p.c. of the total
liabilities to the public (£71,085,289) was
in liquid form and 21.8 p.c. was represented
by coin, bullion, notes, etc., and money at
short call, Also the bank was holding only
£5 7s. 4d. of the public's money for every
£1 of its own funds. Advances were 86.7 p.c.
of deposits. Though the outlook in the pas-
toral and agricultural industries is bright,
the money-market may yet be tighter before
it gets easier.

Profits are still hanging back in the collar,
due to poor underwriting results. But invest-
ments bring in a tidy sum ( £31.589 last year),
so the cautious management of this Dunedin-
controlled concern decided that it would not
matter if a little of the underwriting profit
was distributed and added 6d. to the final
div., making it 124 p.c. That called for an
extra £5OOO, and then the £37,500 handed
out was less than three-quarters of the year’s
net earnings. The balance (£14,307) 'made
reserves more than l\ times greater than the
paid capital (£300,000), of which two-thirds
represents bonus scrip handed out since 1916.
Over the last five years approximately 60 p.c.
of the total net revenue has come from
investments. Last year’s £51.807 was 17.2
p.c. on capital compared with 16.3, 20.9, 11
and 32.3 back to 1923, the average for the
five years being 19.6 p.c. as against an aver-
age 27.7 p.c. for the preceding five years.
The co. does a big marine business; that and
the heavy fire losses of recent years are
responsible for the shrinkage in earnings.

The management, which can judge a risk
with the best of them, pursues a conserva-
tive policy, making no serious effort to reach
out after new business, and in consequence
the growth in premium income has been
comparatively slow. The improvement last
year amounted to £11,883. The continued
drop in the expense rate, which had climbed
very high in 1924, helped the final figures
along, and the underwriting profit moved up
to 8.9 p.c. compared with 7.7, 15, 1.5 and
18.3 p.c. in the four preceding years. From
Ili.e policy-holders’ point of view the National
is unusually strong. Paid capital and re-
serves (£762,603) are 31 times last year’s
net premium incomp, or over twice the
amount usually looked for. In addition
shareholders can be called upon to find
another £700,000 if it is required, and there
is no need to worry about the nature of the
security, which is in this form: —

Last year £33,452 was added to the very
comfortable proportion of cash and nego-
tiable securities, and the amount invested in
mortgages dropped from 13.9 p.c. to 13 p.c.
of the balance-sheet total.
The market looks at the co.’s snug posi-
tion and gives £3 17s. for the £5 shares
paid to £1 10s. each. The return to tin
investor at that price is 4.8 p.c. on a 12i
p.c. div. basis; and the backing amounts to
£2 10s. lOd. per pound of capital paid up.

Thus far only meagre returns have been
won, but the stage is set for better earnings.
Last year two new machines were installed
in India and two in Ceylon, and foreign
profits moved up £3974, reaching £12,469;
but the gain there was largely offset by a
drop of £2484 (making them £4156) in
Australian profits, which were affected by a
new method of calculating betting divi-
dends. However, there has been a partial
return to the old system, and earnings should
benefit. Contracts are in hand for the erec-
tion of four new machines in the F.M.S.
and two at Perth (W.A.). Those at the
latter centre are not expected to be in
use before Dec., 1928, but returns from the
former should benefit the current year’s
earnings. To finance new business 132,500
3 0 p.c. prefs. were issued just before the
books were ruled off, and that made paid
capital £235,616 in 50,000 10 p.c. cum. prefs.
and 191,966 ords. at Oct. 31—-there was
£8270 unpaid and £1920 calls paid in
advance. When all the money is in, 6 p.c.
to the ords., after attending to the' prefs.,
will call for £lO9 less than was netted last
year.
The future is largely wrapped up with
the success of foreign contracts, the most
important of which, so far, is the Long-
champs (Paris) deal. It is reasonable to
expect that, as a result of this Paris estab-
lishment, business with other countries will
follow. The co. is already in touch with
the proper quarters in England, where pros-
pects are said to be good. In the subsidiary
which took over the French contract, the
parent got 100,000 fully-paid ords. for
rights and guaranteed the div. on 100,000
10 p.c. cum. pr.efs. for 20 years. Owing to
delays, due to no fault of the co., the Paris
machines are not expected to start earning
until April next; meantime the parent has
to advance_ the pref. div. The amounts
involved will be a charge against future
earnings of the pup. and the parent’s
and loss figure's will not he affected
thereby, unless, of course, the advance be-
comes a bad debt.
The growing activity is visible in balance-
sheet figures:—
1923. 1926. 1927.
Paid capital .. .. £191,825 £206,879 £235,616
Liabilities .. .. 9,520 13,495 17,289

Shares in other cos. .. —-■ 100,000
Cash .. .. .. 6,604 13,683 30,691
The large cash balance will he reduced as
work on the new contracts proceeds, but
creditors were covered more than twice over
by book debts and stocks. During the year
£19,121 was added to the blanket item,
“Patent rights, models, plant, totalisators,
prepayments, .etc..” making it £217.817.
Exactly how much of that is intangible is
not known to the outsider, but there are
grounds for suspecting that a big portion of
it is froth. Against tbe total a depreciation
reserve of £23.420 has been built up out of
earnings. Last year the co.’s share holding
in the French subsidiary was tossed into the
pot; but the extra £lOO.OOO thus provided
merely offsets an asset that, under existing
terms, will cease to earn anything in 20
years’ time. Until the intangibles, which
overshadow the accounts, are replaced with
solid assets, there must be a good deal of
uncertainty in the position.
The market values the pr.efs. at about par,
and the ords. at about 16s. 3d. The return
at the latter figure is a shade 7| p.c.
on a 6 p.c. div. basis.

The completion of one of the contracts
with the S. Aus. Government and a better
volume of small orders, which kept the
Victorian factory busy throughout the year,
improved profits by £10,313, making them
£19,183. That was after providing for
taxation, for the cost of shifting the Vie.
factory (the lease was resumed without
compensation the co. unsuccessfully
appealed to the High Court), and paying 8
p.c. interest on £30,000 of deoenture money
plus (by the terms of this issue) 10 p.c.
of the profits on the S. Aus. contract. The
provision for taxation and contingencies
stands in the books at £21,792. The more
or less liquid surplus grew from £14,005 to
£48,599 and the book value of the fixed
assets, freehold and plant was £2058 greater
at £47,399. So the co. really did better than
the figures in the table suggest.
For all that, it is having a stiff uphill
climb and there are many steep grades to be
negotiated yet. Lack of working capital is
one of the chief obstacles. Paid capital is
£305,670 in 50,000 A prefs., 5670 B prefs.,
and 250,000 ords., the last lot handed to the
vendors fully paid for patent rights. For
the first three years most of the available
cash was locked up in a contract with the
Melbourne Water Board; small orders re-
turned nothing worth speaking of, and share-
holders have been timid about putting more
money into the business. In March last
they were offered 47,990 prefs., but only
3660 were taken up.
Balance-sheet figures have moved in this
way:—
1925. 1926. 1927.
Debentures .. .. £30,490
Other liabilities .. £17,343 52,867 £44,170

Book debts . . .. 5,433 33,556 26,967
Cash and deposits . . 7,563 13,075 11,679
The board is so well satisfied with the year’s
results that it has decided upon an extensive
programme of expansion. New factories are
to be established at Singapore and in N. S.
Wales, Queensland and Westralia, but no-
thing is said as to what new contracts, if any.
have been secured. Profit-making is largely
governed by loan expenditure, and apart
from an inevitable slackening in that respect
there is a steadily-growing competition in
pipe-making. A further development, for
which arrangements are in hand, will be the
formation of a subsidiary in Australia with
a nominal capital of £1,000,000 to take over
and work Hume Steel’s foreign rights. But
apart from 10,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs. to lie
taken up by the parent in order to provide
immediate working capital, it has not been
decided yet what scrip, if any, will be
offered locally. The intention is to co-
operate with the Hume Pipe Co., which
made good progress last year with the .sale
of its foreign patents. The L T .S.A. is
sfioken of as the first place of operations.
Hume Steel’s prefs. carry a non-cumula-
tive 10 p.c., but advance with the ords. in
any dividend the latter may receive. Last
year’s net profit was nearly 31 times their
usual requirements. They rank equally
with the ords. in the event of liquidation, so
the investor who is looking for security
above all things had better turn the other
way. At Sept. 30 he could see only 4s. sd.
per £1 share in net tangibles. The market
prices the A shares around 225., and the
return to the investor at that figure is a
shade over 9 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis.

“Towkay”: The scare about the world’s
shortage of tin in the near future need not
be taken seriously. Improved methods and

It is the last-mentioned which has saved the

now English capital is being invested there,
both in re-opening old mines and developing
new ones. There appear to be still many
alluvial dredging areas in the world, par-
ticularly in Siam, while the stabilisation of
the price of tin at £250-£3OO would warrant

The progress in the treatment of shale
and low-grade coals for oil is reviving in-
terest in the huge deposits of brown coal in
Victoria. The Bergius process has long
been regarded as one most likely to profit-
ably treat a low-value product under the
handicap of high production costs. The Aus-
tralian rights are held by an Australian co.
whose experts have added improvements. The
final laboratory experiments were carried
out 18 months ago at Sydney Uni., and have
since been confirmed on a commercial scale
at the company’s plant in Germany. Results
indicate that under existing conditions the
shale and low r -quality coals of N. S. Wales
and the brown coals of Victoria will yield
a profit. But sodden masses or those with
deep overburden are still beyond hope.

Roma is the hub of the geological world
in Australia these days. Professors Wool-
nough and H. C. Richards have just re-
turned from official investigations. Dr. Jen-
sen and E. C. Smith have been there on
private jobs connected with oil prospecting
areas. De Vila, the Batavian (Java) geolo-
gist, recently sprinted up, bent on private
investigation. Malcolm Newman has just re-
turned from inspecting American oilfields,
and intends having a look at Roma. Wool-
nough’s latest statement that much more pro-.
specting is necessary before a producing well
can be hoped for really summarises the “Wild
Cat’s” statement of a few weeks ago that
the se.arch for oil was only starting with the
two new bores lower down the dome, and
that further developments were not likely
till they got down to their objective.
* * * *
Professor Woolnough reports that unques-
tionably oil is coming from the Roma bore;
but it isn’t a bit like crude petroleum. As
a matter of fact the gas has to be let go
every other day, and between 100 and 200
gallons of oil are salved on -every such occa-
sion—really condensed from the vapor. But
it is a refined oil; and apparently the refin-
ing process is taking place somewhere in the
neighborhood. Nature, of course, could easily
set up a retort underground. The purity of
the product is very interesting; but it sug-
gests that the source of the gas is some
distance away.
# $ $ ' $
One of the groups interested in Roma
consists of well-known Sydney men, shep-
herded by E. A. Laurence, the Sydney soli-
citor, who has been interested in the search
for oil since 1922 —he has been the main-
spring of the Lander co. throughout its
troubled life. These men, who have formed
a co. called Builders, Ltd., don’t despise
money, but it has been put to them that it
is a national duty to prove the Maranoa
basin, and establish the industry if the
material exists; and it is on this basis that
the co. has been formed. Builders, Ltd., will
not hold any country on its own account.
The idea is to form a number of small cos.
(no-one can hold more than 20,000 acres),
over which Builders, Ltd., will exercise a
certain control. Each will have a very small
capital—it is not thought that more than
£5OOO will be needed—and its work will be
purely geological prospecting, probably with
a diamond drill operated by contractors.
Builders, Ltd., will provide part of the capi-
tal of these cos. and will assist wherever
assistance is shown to be needed. Their
records will be collated, and on the evidence
thus provided it will be determined where
a bore shall be put down to tap oil—pre-
suming that that step is found to be justi-
fied. It is expected that the Commonwealth
Government will subsidise the actual cost of
drilling the prospecting holes £ for £. Of
course, cores will be taken out and pre-
served. .
The delay of the Queensland Mines Depart-
ment in granting prospecting areas to holders
of oil permits has been due to a desire to
protect the public from the rapacity of com-
pany-floaters who have got in first in certain
areas and have spent no money in prospect-
ing. Some of these floats were designed to
snare 25 to 30 p.c. of the total issue as paid
ups for the onerous and expensive work of
getting a permit. The Government has de-
cided that only 74 p.c. of the issue shall be
p.u.. plus any cash expenditure incurred. A
further 124 p.c. can be issued pro rata as
fully paid to purchasers of contribs. Any
number of shares may be held in reserve, but
in all future issues all shareholders shall
rank pari passu as to rights and interests
in proportion to their holdings.
While great credit is due to the Govern-
ment for trying to block the speculator whose
aim is to squeeze oil out of the public, it
is doubtful whether a prospector can do
much with 74 p.c. in paid ups. If, as will
generally happen, he must go to the public
for money, lie is liable to find the under-
writers wanting all of the 74 p.c. It should
be possible to draft a regulation severely
restricting the paid-ups in a purely prospect-
ing venture, but giving the Minister authority
to empower the distribution of 25 or 30 p.c.
in paid-ups if and when prospecting proves
anything good. What we have to guard
against is the repression of Australian in-
vestment in these oil-prospecting ventures.
If that happens we shall certainly have
American oil people coming in and saying:
“Your own people have done nothing with
this. Now give us a chance.”
* * * *
Dr. Jensen writes that, in his opinion,
“Catalyst” (B. l/12/’27) has made the
following mistakes-
(а) The Roma gas is not a dry gas, but contains
enough petrol to merit being styled a wet gas.
(б) If most of the world’s great oilfields contain
indications of some sort, as “Catalyst” says, why
does he adopt such a pessimistic view of the Roma
indications'?
(c) If “Catalyst” had the least geological know-
ledge of the Roma district he would not suggest
that the missing part of the Roma gas (or oil)
might be hundreds of miles away. Buried ridges
divide one artesian basin into many distinct basins,
as boring results show.
(d) The Roma gas and oil is not derived from
the Cretaceous, but from the Lower Jurassic; nor
is “Catalyst” right in saying that even one per cent,
of the world’s gas-wells is derived from the Cre-
taceous.
(e) Dr. Wade in his reports, analytically ex-
amined, admitted that the chances of payable oil
were best in Queensland. His knowledge of Queens-
land geology was much less than that of the Queens-
land geologists who have never seen an oilfield, but
who nevertheless from oil bulletins from all parts
of the world understand the principles of oil geology
as well as the best oil geologists of the world. To
trained gelogists, who have applied their minds to
oil geology, experience of oilfields, however advantage-
ous, is not necessary.
(/) There are much greater authorities on oil
than Mr. Cunningham Craig. His remarks on Roma
in his work “Oil Finding” were based on papers
and bulletins published from 15 to 27 years ago,
and he had no opportunity to take into cognisance
recent work. It is equally unfair to Mr. Cunningham
Craig and to the case' for oil in Queensland to
quote from his work in a matter in which he was
undoubtedly behind the times.
(g) “Catalyst” mentions the Anglo-Persian geo-
logists sent around by the Federal Government, and
says they “came and went and were silent,” They
were not silent; they reported: “The most significant
feature of the gas struck at Roma is the fact that
it is what we would speak of as ‘wet gas.’ Such
gases are usually associated with oilfields, and while
they have been observed in districts where no oil
has been found such instances are rare.”
* * * *
Dan Green writes re Roma oil permits:
The “Wild Cat” said the other day that the holders
of Roma oil permits made, roughly, three groups.
I don’t know anything about any such groups. I
certainly don’t belong to any one of them.
In 1923, after Lander Oil Co. had selected its
site, Dr. Jensen and I went to Roma and pegged
out five 2000-acre blocks (the maximum area under
the Act then) ; Messrs. J. S. Hanlon and Lewis
MacDonnal were asociated with us then, and still
are, and not anyone else. In 1924 the Theodore
Government declared the area a Government reserva-
tion and returned us our fees; but Minister for
Mines Alf Jones promised us the right to re-select
the area should the reservation be thrown open.
This has been done, and we have been granted an
oil permit. Under the present Act we were entitled
to select 10,000 acres each, but we have been con-
tent to re-peg our old area; that is and has always
been Dr. Jensen’s choice. He is at present making
a survey to locate the sites for wells and scout bores.
Bullfinch (W.A.) is bucked up by a find
said to be a continuation of that made by the
late Dorrie Doolette and his mates. Dis-
covered in 1910, Bullfinch immediately began
to produce tens of thousands of pounds’
worth' of gold, and promised to be a wonder.
A disturbance at shallow depth, however,
spoilt it; but the big low-grade lodes in the
northern workings enabled the mine to go
on turning out gold for years, and contribu-
ted largely to its total yield of nearly
£1,000,000. The London co., which acquired
the show' after a few picks had been put into
the ground, gave it up a few years ago, and
wmrking parties are now in possession.
* * * $
Perth is thinking of again turning its
attention to the reefs of Edjudina, on the
eastern side of North Coolgardie. This
field has 10 miles of workings which have
shown good average yields at shallow depths.
A mile of ground on the north end was
selected for trial by Perth speculators a year
or two ago, but lack of capital nipped the
enterprise in the bud. At that time values
in ‘hard ground at 200 ft. were declared to be
all right, and in one spot a winze, down
280 ft., showed the gold to be living. The
doubt is whether the shoots are big and
plentiful enough to warrant development.
* * * *
The Commonwealth Government having
decided that Australian iron ore might just
as well be sold to the foreigner as wheat and
wool, a Japanese expert is now en route to
the West to negotiate with a Perth syndicate
for supplies from Yampi. A tentative agree-
ment for the shipment of 150,000 tons or
mora a year is expected to be signed early in
1928.
An Adelaide crowd of modest means has
sent someone to the West to look for gold
alluvial. They are banking on Professor
David’s statement of a year or so ago that
more than the 36,000,0000 z. of gold already
produced there is still contained in the
unproved alluvial deposits of ancient river
beds on the Murchison, East Murchison, Mt.
Margaret and East Coolgardie goldfields.
* * * *
Something out of the usual in mining re-
ports has been furnished by Robert Sargeant
and R. B. Clark, prospectors for Alluvial
Gold Deposits Syndicate, an Adelaide con-
cern. The pair have put in two months pro-
specting in the salt-lake country in Central
W.A., from Lake Nannine to Lake Lefroy.
At Lake Carey the prospectors obtained good
values over a fairly large area, and a dredg-
ing lease of 500 acres has been applied for to
the eastward of the Devon mine. A fair
amount of gold has been got from the lake-
bed in the past by casual prospectors, includ-
ing one 250 z. nugget. A feature of the dry
lake-bed is that it is covered with the foot-
prints of aboriginal fossickers, showing
sharply in the cement-like surface. When
there is water in the lake the natives walk
all over it “specking” gold, the little specks
showing up clearly under a few inches of
water. Working the dry ground seems to
be beyond their capacity. It is proposed to
work the area by sluicing, using gravel and
nozzle-pumps driven by an electric motor.
This will be the first property of its kind
tested with a plant, though the Government
returns show' that over IOOOoz. has been won
from 1J acre in the vicinity by very primi-
tive hand-working methods. Other lakes
tested promise well, and if the present ven-
ture turns out a success the salt lakes may
attract further attention from alluvial gold-
seekers.

Portion of the pontoon for the Palmer
River Gold Co.’s (N.Q.) dredging plant has
been unloaded at Cooktown and transhipped
to Laura. Another 35 tons will complete
the plant, and as soon as the dry season
commences, about May next, a start will be
made, with two 6-ton motor-lorries, to
transport the material from Laura to the
field at Strathleven. Thel route is over
heavy sandy country, and the £2OO to be
spent on repairs by the Cook Shire Council
won’t go far towards making it less heavy.

The Bluff coalfield (C.Q.) has a remark-
ably fine seam of smokeless coal varying from
12ft. to 18ft. thick of clean fuel. Owing to
lack of a market it has been worked merely
by a small party of tributors. Lately it
caught the Australian Admiralty’s eye, and
a test shipment of 1300 tons was sent for
trial on the cruisers. The coal is low in
ash, has fine steaming qualities, and in
B.T.U.’s is one of th-s highest in Australia.
Reports have gone on to England; and if
the Admiralty is satisfied regarding its
clinkering properties, it will have a
great chance of displacing Westport coal in
the Navy. With a seam of that size a very
big tonnage is available in a small area.

In the Wynyard district (Tas.) an old-
time prospector has found an alluvial deposit
in a concentrated form which has given
some assays of high value for gold; three
small samples of the wash going 1090 z.,
12oz. and 420 z. to the ton. Naturally con-
centration was responsible for these results.
A further surprise was that from one sample
the following metals were recorded: Silver,
50z.; platinum, 3oz. Bdwt.; osmiridium, 4oz.
4dwt. 16gr.; and tin, 6 p.c. Mclntosh Reid,
State Director of Mines, made a flying visit
to the area and examined the few potholes.
He reported the existence of gold, tin, silver,
osmiridium and platinum, but did not think
there was enough wash to be payable. A
prospecting syndicate is, however, to care-
fully test the ground.

Ronpibon, one of the Palfreyman interests,
shows an improvement on its October figures
(33 tons from 92,000 yards, or .861 b. per
yard) with 42.25 tons from 79,000 yards, or
a trifle better than 1.281 b. to the yard. The
co., which was formed in Melbourne in 1916,
holds 314 acres in Southern Siam, and its
dredge, which did not commence digging
until 1924, has been earning fair profits from
this and the Ronpibon Extended. Average
results have not measured up to original
boring values of well over a pound to the
yard; but the past two months have
improved solidly.

Burma Malay, a Sydney holding and
prospecting show founded in November,
1925, has announced that it intends to
enter on an active prospecting campaign.
To do this reconstruction has been con-
sidered necessary, and a meeting was held
at the office in Kuala Lumpur (F.M.S.)
last month to effect this. Capital is to be
increased, and the question of an issue of
free shares is under consideration. Burma’s
original authorised capital was £50,000 in
£1 shares. Issued capital was 30,000
shares, all f.p., 20,000 being held in reserve,
the promoters receiving 15,000 f.p. shares.
In November, 192 G, the co. floated Katu
to work an area at Puket, in Western
Siam. Burma Malay got £70,000, or
£30,000 in f.p. shares in Katu and £40,000
in cash, paying the owners and holders of
surface rights out of this. Katu’s author-
ised capital was £lOO,OOO in £l shares.
Issued was 30,000 shares f.p., 320,000 con-
tritis. paid to 7s. 6d., and 10,000 shares in
reserve. The area is about 550 acres, bored
by E. N. Mulligan, one of the directors.
He estimated 401 acres as suitable dredging
ground having an average of ,871 b. of 72
per cent. t.o. per c.y. The electrically-
driven dredge of 125,000 yards capacity per
month is expected to be ready by July next,
Shipments from England having begun.
How far these arrangements and others in
connection with another subsidiary, Renong
Consolidated, will be affected by what the
directors’ report calls “certain difficulties”
in carrying out the directors’ original pro-
posals is not known.

That all shareholders in the Westralian
manganese mines are not thrilled by the
fact that the railway has been completed
is shown by an advt. announcing 375 ordin-
aries for sale at 18s.
•!'
According to official figures Great Boulder
made £l5OO profit for September and £lOOO
for October. Many shareholders would be
arrested were they to state publicly what
they express privately concerning this appar-
ently sloppy method of furnishing informa-
tion to them.

South Kalgurli (W.A.) has paid divs.
regularly for years and looks like doing so
for a long time. Latest half-yearly estimate
of ore reserves show an improvement on
the previous one, and, unlike most Kalgoorlie
gold-mines, the shadow of this one seems
to be growing more instead of less. Care-
ful management has a lot to do with it.

Judge Wasley, of Vic., struck the right
note the other day, when, addressing a
witness who was a musician, he urged him
to give his evidence “double forte and an-
dante, with few rests.” And he did it with-
out a quaver.
“Piriti”: Comparison of Maoriland’s Pri-
ministers Balance, Seddon and Massey in a
recent par. reminds me of an interview with
A. W. LACEY,
Labor M.H.R.
for Grey (S.A.).
King Dick. As I
went in a member
passed out. Never
did a man display
self-satisfaction so
blatantly. Seddon
was lying back in
his chair and rum-
bling with laughter.
“What’s up, Dick?”
I inquired. “Did
you see Blank go
out?” he asked.
“He seemed pleased
with himself,” I
replied. “Ho-ho-
lio!” roared Sed-
don. “He came to
see me about get-
ting a job for a car-
penter on the Wil-
son wharf. I asked
his opinion about
Imperial affairs, and
he forgot all about
his poor dam’ car-
penter.” He tapped
a finger impres-
sively : “If you
want to sidetrack a
man, ‘consult’ him
on some important
matter; it never
fails !”
Stephen, Bishop of Carpentaria, runs the
rule over an area far greater than that of
many a European principality. It covers
York Peninsula, the Territory into Oentralia,
and the Torres Strait islands to New Guinea.
The tall bishop has sailed in cockroachy
pearling boats, and camped with miners,
cattlemen, timbermen, sandalwood-getters
and buffalo shooters. Few men have mixed
with such a variety of men of all creeds,
colors and opinions. He is on his way to
London, in search of funds for the diocese.
And he has been invited to preach in Can-
terbury Cathedral and Westminster Abbey
—a double-barrelled compliment that is
probably without parallel.
A vote of thanks seems a simple thing
to move, but some men would nrefer to move
the Pyramids. David Uniapon, the educated
full-blooded aboriginal who lectures to
Scotchbyterian audiences throughout Aus-
tralia on mission work, was being handed
a verbal bouquet at a recent meeting. “People
have been telling us,” said the enthusiastic
mover of the motion, “that the only thing
the aborigine is fit for is to be made a
Christian. Now we have evidence that he
is fit for something better.”
Ned Hanlon, who represents Ithaca, a
Brisbane seat, is the youngest member in the
Queensland State talk-shop. He went to*
Egypt and later France with the sth Bat-
talion, and came back after the Armistice
with three stripes on his arm. He caused
a miniature earthquake in Labor circles
prior to the last Queensland elections by
dumping Jack Gildery, who had held the seat
for more than a decade.
Students from the Cardinal’s College at
Manly (Sydney) who have voted for Mon-
signor Tom Hayden every time his name has
come up for a nomination' for a mitre may have
another chance—he is up and about again
after a severe illness. Possibly no cleric in
the world has so often been close to episco-
pal honors and missed. Always in the first
three, lie has just as regularly been beaten
on the post. Principal interest attaches to
the veteran because he is the last of the
“foundation professors” of the Cardinal’s
College of half a century ago who is still
at the institution and in harness.
An Australian has succeeded in securing
one of the Melbourne Uni. plums. Dr. E. J.
Hartung lias been allotted the Chair of
Chemistry, which lie had filled temporarily
for a year in place of Prof. Rivett. After
getting his D.Sc. degree at Melb. ’Varsity
five years ago he visited and studied in
Europe and U.S.A. At 34 he is young
enough to be a driving force in Uni. life.
Old Palmer miners will remember Owen
Reynolds, who drove his teams from Cook-
town when the gold was being won by the
ton from the great Northern field. Later he
became proprietor of the Commercial Hotel,
which, when Coolctown lapsed into obscurity,
was shifted holus-bolus to Gladstone. Rey-
nolds was one of the first men on the Palmer
and the first teamster to come overland from
Townsville through Mount Surprise—at that
time virgin country. That was in ’73. To-
day, with some old fossickers, he sits out-
side the Great Northern in Cooktown ex-
changing reminiscences of the times when
the wily Chinese scratched millions out of
the alluvial fields of the North.
Had the advice of Leonard Rodway, the
Speck’s botanist, been followed 30 years ago,
Mt. Wellington, the background of Hobart,
would to-day be forest-clad. As a youngster
the sea caught Rodway’s fancy. He was a
cadet on the Worcester; Togo, later to
become an admiral of the Japanese fleet, was
a fellow-snottie. For a while Rodway sailed
on windjammers in the coolie-carrying trade.
He deserted a life of adventure and took up
tooth-carpentering. But that ugly feature of
life did not appeal to a man for whom love,
of nature was above all other things, and he
relinquished practice for his beloved plant-
hunting.
A relic of Australia’s earlier history is
the neglected grave of “Thunderbolt” (Fred
Ward) in the old cemetery of Uralla, near
Armidale (N.S.W.). Thunderbolt was killed
while fording Uralla Creek in an attempt
to escape the pursuing police. The tomb-
stone on Thunderbolt's grave reads “Erected
by the residents of New England. Thunder-
bolt (Fred Ward).” No “sacred to the
memory of” ; not even a date. This is sur-
prising, as the bushranger was popular in
the district. Thunderbolt had the reputa-
tion of never robbing the poor; on the con-
trary, he often supplied hard-up farmers
with money.
Lake Bonney. into which the water is
drained from the Millicent Flats, in the
s.e. of S.A., was discovered in the ’fifties by
a traveller named Bonney. It empties into
the ocean between sandhills. Some children
playing in the hummocks the other day
unearthed a gold watoh in a remarkable
state of preservation. As it bore the name of
Bonney, it is presumed that it was lost by
the discoverer. It had been hidden for over
70 years.
Usually age prevails in important honor-
ary appointments in the Jewish community,
but at 33 Saul Symonds has been made pre-
sident of the N.S.W. Board of Hebrew
Education. Although the son of a wealthy
father, Symonds won his way through the
University. He became modern languages
master at his school while studying for the
law. He was admitted to the Bar six years
ago. The previous president was Rabbi
Cohen, who, following some agitation about
the failure to extend Hebrew education to
the younger generation, has taken the new
position of Director of Education.
Few Victorians were better known for
their many parts than Gustave Ramaciotti,
who passed over in Melbourne the other day
at 66. He was closely associated with the
Firm in theatrical enterprises, but he was
no chocolate soldier. Whenever the bugle
blew he rushed offstage to see what it was
about. He attended the Italian W “ in J ll
poll on behalf of his native land but, when
the Great War arrived lie was too old toi
active service, and held various headquarter
Jobs at home. If he had lived another year
he would have completed half a century of
service with the military forces of the States
and Commonwealth. The late Bng.-Gene
was a brilliant master of tongues and authoi
of a book on the Tripolitan disturbance.
C. C. Kingston had a succession of young
law partners, and two of them got into
politics. One, George Ash, died too soon;
the other, A. J. McLachlan, is the Senator
the Bruce-Pages sent off to Melbourne to
help settle the wharf-labor trouble. Me-
Lachlan was a
country solicitor
when Kingston
asked him to join
up, and the big
man never had an-
other partner. The
state in which Mc-
Lachlan found his
senior’s affairs
ought to have
warned him to leave
politics alone; but
it didn’t. Physi-
cally, he is the big-
gest man in the
Ministry he has
only an honorary
job, though he was
Attorney - General
while Latham was
away and in his
home city he has a
great practice as a
commercial lawyer.
There couldn’t be a
better training for
this last job his
colleagues gave
him.
HUGH WRIGHT,
of the Mitchell
Library (Sydney).
There’s an old boatman down by Man-o’-
war Steps, Sydney, who has been rowing
people backwards and forwards to vessels
on the harbor for more than half a centnry.
His name is H. A. Richards. Most of the
ships were sailing vessels in the days when
he started, although an occasional paddle-
wheeler thudded up the harbor. To-day the
20,000-tonners take up their berths with
phlegmatic precision, but there still are
strays in the streams which bring odd fares
to the. old boatmen of the water-front.
Tom Gilchrist, although over 65, is being
retained until the end of the year as clerk
of Vic.’s Legislative Council. Ileywood
assistant-clerk, is also due for retirement.
Whatever rearrangement of staff takes place,
Percy Poole, the Usher and Clerk of Com-
mittees, will get a step up. The road to
promotion will be opened for one or two
Assembly officers. Gilchrist left the Argus
27 years ago to join the Parliamentary staff.
W. H. McCarthy, choirmaster of St. Pat.’s
R.C. church on Church Hill, Sydney, is lay-
ing aside the baton after 15 years. The name
of W. 11. McCarthy was known in Sydney
half a century ago when its owner —the
father of the choir-master —opened business
in Hunter-street as a chemist. One
brother, Bob, after giving the pill business
a trial, entered the Society of Jesus. Another
brother took up the scalpel and practises in
Dubbo (N.S.W.), and a third joined the
Devil’s Brigade.
One of the oldest inhabitants of Western
N.S.W., who saw the first train for
Broken Hill puff out of Menindie the other
day, was William Maiden, who has lived in
those parts for 65 years. He arrived in
Australia at the age of two. His parents
settled at Pooncarie, through which the
youngster saw the passing of Sturt’s expedi-
tion to Central Australia. When he was a lad
of 13 the family moved on to Menindie.
Maiden played a part in the search for silver
in N.S.W. He pegged out a claim at
Thackaringa in 1875 with Paddy Green,
storekeeper at Menindie, and that brought
some money. And he sold other blocks pro-
fitably, although he would have been a mil-
lionaire could he have foreseen what those
leases would bring to their later owners.
Australia lost one of its keenest art col-
lectors when Thomas Colledge went west.
Fifty-four years ago he went to Tingha
(N.S.W.) as a mine manager. His first hobby
was the accumulation of mineral specimens.
When he had gathered together the finest
collection in the State he started anew on
art stones, timbers and abo. implements.
Unfortunately, when his fine home, Fair-
view, was destroyed by fire a few months
back most of the valuable collection was lost.
He had notched 86 before the end came. -
R. G. Nesbit, who is leaving the Licensing
Court to become S.A.’s new Crown Prose-
cutor, is a son of the brilliant Paris Nesbit,
K.C., who died recently. He was in prac-
tice with his father and N. A. Webb, late
Judge of the Federal Arbitration Court,
now himself in private practice. Reg
Nesbit, when in the twenties, was a cham-
pion ped. and won the valuable Stawell
Gift.
After close on half a century’s service
John Gilder, Victoria’s Chief Electoral
Officer, has said good-bye to the service.
Beginning as a lad of 13 in the post office
at Sale, he went on to the Mines and Chief
Secretary’s Departments till he found his
real place in the electoral branch. Gilder
is only 61. He was one of the three com-
missioners who redistributed Assembly seats
last year, and that did not make him popular
with Labor, although the new electorates
helped to put Hogan and co. in office if not
in power.
R. J. Tillyard, whose specialty is the dis-
covery of insects to sool on to plant-pests
and diseases, wasn’t long in Australia on his
recent visit before he got an offer from the
Commonwealth Government to become its
chief entomologist. He has accepted. Till-
yard is a 46-year-old Englishman who, after
acquiring a doctor’s gown in science at
Cambridge, came to Sydney and taught
maths, and science at the Grammar School.
By way of diversion he picked up a D.Sc.
from Sydney Uni. and a Fellowship of chc
Royal Society—the latter came his way for
a treatise on dragon-flies. Eight years ago
the privately-endowed Cawthron Institute of
Research at Nelson (M.L.) attracted him
as director. Now he has a wider field, but
one in which he has already worked from a
distance.
Seventy-three years have passed since the
storming of the Eureka Stockade on the
goldfield of Ballarat. In his recently pub-
lished book J. Grattan Grey mentions that
at Timaru (M.L.) is living John L. Potter,
now nearing the century, whose claim to be
the sole survivor of the rebels appears to bo
indisputable. “Although his hair is snow
white, he is wonderfully well preserved,’’
says this chronicler. “He has never worn
glasses, never lost a tooth, has never had
a day’s illness and never feels tired. He
neither drinks nor smokes and still retains
a clear recollection of all events connected
with the rising of the diggers.”
11. P. Williams, first campaign director of
the N.S.W. Country party, pushed off a move-
ment which is now half the Government of
Australia. Williams directed the C.P. cam-
paign for 10 years, and was editor of Land,
the party organ. While on a world tour
as representative of the N.S.W. Meat Board
in search of markets for beef and mutton,
he became interested in wireless, and that
brought him the offer of his present job with
2FC —the big Sydney broadcasters.
The papal nuncio to Sydney’s Eucharistic
Congress next September will.be Archbishop
Cerretti, already well known in Australia,
where he served as papal delegate for a few
Judge CURLEWIS, the husband of novelist
Ethel Turner, and himself greatly
interested in keeping the dead cat of
Yankee and Australian slang out of the
well of English.
years. Cerretti is regarded as the Vatican’s
greatest diplomat. He has been papal nuncio
in Paris for the past few years. After the
Sydney Congress he will proceed to Brisbane
to lay the foundation-stone of Australia’s
largest Catholic cathedral. The building is
to be constructed of Australian material only,
and will cost half a million.
NO PLACE FOR HIM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Speaking at a reunion of returned soldiers at
Canberra, Mr. Hughes said he had never been able
to discover any sign of life in the Senate. Another
speaker recalled that the ex-Prime Minister had
previously likened the institution to ‘a morgue with
36 bodies on slabs.’ ”
No passionate harangues. No angry strife.
No voices bandying invective shrilly.
Less like a scene of animated life
Than some dim morgue or mausoleum
chilly.
Seldom a flash of wit to light the gloom,
Or counteract suggestions of a tomb.
It wouldn’t do for Billy.
No burning eloquence with import rife
For Governments whose paths are rough
and hilly.
No roars and cheers to rouse, like drum
and fife,
The drowsing legislators willy-nilly.
No rows worth speaking of. No fret and
fume.
No whirling words compound of spleen and
spume.
A hopeless House—to Billy.
The galleries are empty. Scarce a wife
But what would find such entertainment
silly.
No guillotine to drop the cutting knife.
No chueker-out required, in vestments
frilly.
To drag defiant brawlers from the room.
A Chamber, you may readily assume,
Of Horrors, this —for Billy !

“Nuces”: I was riding down a track
through the scrub one morning when my hat
was plucked off my head. The cause I
found to be a thick line of cobweb stretched
from side to side of the track (about 7 feet
wide) and of exceptional strength. Now,
what spider did that?
“Sucre”: I turned over a piece of moist
bark in my cabbage patch and brought into
view a small spider. It had a deep-blue
head, a scarlet back and under-carriage and
a deep-blue posterior. It was equipped with
four “oars” on each side of its carcase and
two abaft its “lamps.” Name, please!
* sfc * *
“Milltrack” : “Failin’ trees on ’illsides, is
it?” Tassie Charlie began. “Fye failed ’em
on ’ills like the side of an ’ouse an’ on’y
’ad trouble with one. An’ even that one
done me a good turn. I’m out on the
ranges splittin' on me lonely, about five miles
from ’ome, w’en I find I’m clean out o’
tucker. So I writes a letter to the missus
askin’ 'or to send me some. While I’m
waitin’ for the bullocky to take me letter
in I pins it with a file to the butt o’ the
tree I’m failin’. When I thinks me tree’s
going where I wants it there’s a puff of
wind, and over she goes backwards,-straight
down the ’ill out o’ sight, an’ just then I
remember I ’aven’t give me letter to the
bullocky. That night, while I’m thinkin’
of ’oofing it in for tucker, who should I see
JUST THE RIGHT FIT.
“Gib it job, boss?”
“Nothin’ doin’, Jacky.”
“That budgery good job, boss. I take him.”

with a tucker bag strapped on ’er back
When that tree goes down the ’ill it finishes
up in me back yard. The old woman comes
rushiu’ out thinkin’ the end of the world’s
come, and the first thing she spots is me

concluded, with a belligerent glare around,
"you mightn’t berlie’e me, but I splits
twenty thousan’ palin’ out o’ that tree in
me week-ends right at me own door.”
* # * *
“Barangkali” : I can’t agree with “Yohn”
(B. 24/11/’27) that the snake’s suscepti-
bility to music is a myth. A cobra was
seen in the undergrowth opposite my place
in Katong, and my boy undertook to have
it removed. Early next morning an Indian
fakir arrived and commenced playing a
barbaric tune on the fife. Presently there
was a movement in the grass, and two
cobras made their appearance and were
promptly despatched. “Yohn” can’t con-
vince me that those cobras were enticed out
of the undergrowth by movements of the
fakir’s hands.
“Nikko”: A Sydney man and his wife,
enjoying a back-to-nature holiday, pitched
their camp in a remote valley in the Blue
Mountains near a pool. One morning the
husband was fishing, and his wife, wishing
to brighten the camp with a little music,
placed the portable gramophone on a tree-
stump. Rising presently to change the
record, she discovered that the audience had
been increased by two. When her husband
arrived the snakes had vanished, but her
description of the two brown heads swaying
to the strains of a violin solo led to an
embargo being placed on the gramophone for
the rest of the holiday.
“Pick”: When we had the Bibbenluke
sheep on the summer runs at Kiandra —there
are more snakes to the acre in the Kiandra
district than there are to the square mile
in any other part of N.S.W. —our nightly
pastime was reckoning up the crawlers we
had waddied during the day. The man who
regularly topped the tally was a shepherd
who always carried with him his concertina.
Again, when a long’un took up his home-
stead area under our hut at Bukalong the
squeak of a fiddle proved the prelude to his
death.
* * * *
“Cassidy”: Is the committee familiar
with the bombardier-beetle? It is a kind of
walking flame-thrower, being able. to eject
a jet of fire, apparently containing phos-
phorus, when disturbed or touched; this
explodes with a hiss into bluish smoke on
coming in contact with the air, and inflicts
a sharp little burn, leaving a yellowish stam.
The beetle can fire five or six shots without
recharging. I have spoken to hundreds of
bushmen about these insects, but very few
had heard of them; the majority were
inclined to think I had been imbibing too
freely. The beetles live under stones or logs
in swampy ground, are black and tan in
color and about three-quarters of an inch
in length. I recently collected some fine
specimens in the Wellington (N.S.W.) dis-
trict, where they have existed for the past
25 years to my knowledge, but in a very
limited area —about 50 yards of a small creek,
where there is permanent water. I have
searched for them in many places inland, but
have failed to locate them anywhere else,
though I understand they can be found on
the Myall Lakes in the Hunter River district.
New Guinea also produces a similar but
larger species. America has them too.

“Wingella”: “Sea Nomad” is right and
“Carisbrook, Jun.,” wrong in regard to the
putting out of the light on Clark Island.
Commander Bennett, of the Geranium, took
moving pictures of the re-floating of the
Tasman, and of the Clark Island light, and
I have heard him positively declare that the
light was put out by a moth’s fluttering
wings.
* * * *
“Cartot”: Touching “Ming’s” story of
the migration to sea of dragon-flies from the
Maorilaud coast (B. 10/11/’27), such occur-
rences are by no means rare in the insect
world. Some years ago, near Brunswick
Heads, I witnessed a migration of the small
black-and-brown locusts so plentiful on the
N.S.W. North Coast in summer-time. The
exodus began with twos and threes, followed
by small swarms numbering perhaps a few
dozen; these gradually increased until there
was a procession extending for more than
half a mile, with only a few gaps here and
there. The tail-end finally vanished over the
sea, heading due east in a perfectly straight
line.
* * * *
“Hotspur”: We were camped on the
Thomson (Q.), where no wood exists. The
cook brought out the old quart-pot, filled it
with water and lit a tuft of grass. The
fire jumped from tuft to tuft while cookie
laboriously followed its trail with the pot.
Yard by yard his smile grew larger, and
moment by moment the water warmed, until
at last it boiled, when he gave a joyful
shout —followed by a loud curse. He was a
mile from camp and had forgotten the tea.

THE OED DE-LICENSED PUB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lizzie struggled bravely onward, loaded up
with camping gear,
Though at times her engine groaned like
some lost sold :
For the track was rough and rutted —it
required some nerve to steer,
To dodge a stump meant landing in a hole.
Clouds of dust and heat excessive
Made the atmosphere oppressive,
While the insects were a torment and a
goad
My language was unlawful,
And my thirst was something awful,
When I saw a joyful sight beside the road.
’Twas a “wayside inn” I’d spotted, and I
almost gave three cheers,
As I raced the old ’bus forward at her top.
I thought of smiling barmaids and a row
of foam-capped beers,
And wondered just how many I could stop ;
But my sweet anticipation
Soon was changed to consternation,
As round that tumble-down old place I
strode.
I was dumb and disconcerted
To discover ’twas deserted —
Just an old de-licensed pub beside the
road.
Life and gaiety had vanished —all the doors
were locked and barred ;
Never more the cheery lights would pierce
the gloom ;
And around the broad verandah, where the
drunken' swaggies sparred,
All was peaceful now, and silent as the
tomb.
I stood and ruminated
On the subjects they debated
In that bar-room, when the amber liquid
flowed ;
Shearing tallies they recounted,
Rucking prads were oft remounted.
In that little out-back pub beside the road.
ANOTHER THOUGHTLESS FELLOW.
HOUSEHOLDER (to pilot, after the crash ): “Struth, mate, you ain’t left the missus much
room ter chop tin! wood.”
For the-place to hear of records and the
deeds of super-men
Is at shanties where the booze is flowing
free;
When the thirsty souls foregather and they
fill ’em up again '%
Here’s where unknown “champs” by dozens
you may see:
Out-back runners, wrestlers, scrappers,
Fencers, drovers, shearers, trappers;
And the bloke whose bullocks hauled the
bigarest load ;
Men who swam the raging torrent —
All vaunted her-e, I’ll warrant,
At this old de-licensed pub beside the road.
Now the tussocks grew around it, and the
fast encroaching scrub
Seemed to creep, with stealthy movement
towards the door.
And the sunlight through the windows of the
long abandoned pub
Showed green spears of grass protruding
through the floor.
With its walls all dirt-bespattered,
And its signboard sagged and battered,
There was little in the mildewy abode
Mirth and jollity suggesting,
Or a crowd the bar a-breasting
At this old de-licensed pub beside the road.
With thirst unquenched I turned away, and
cranked old Lizzie up,
And I wondered just how many weary
miles
Lay between me and the fervid joy of just
one brimming cup
Served with (or minus) woman’s witching
smiles.
And I’ve tried to write a chanty
To the old deserted shanty,
Where in days agone the good brown
liquor flowed ;
Wliereunto the traveller wandered,
And his hard-earned cash was squandered
In that now de-licensed pub beside the
road.
VICTORIA.

“Wang” : Dad had had wireless installed,
hut the first night, after an hour’s listening,
he was disposed to be peevish. “The thing's
a fraud,” he grumbled; “there’s nothin’
worth listenin’ to. Why don’t the bloke give
us somethin' of int’rest t’ country people—
what won all th’ prizes at th’ Wangabilly
Show yesterd’y, or somethin’ like that?”
The announcer spoke: “Sam Daliler’s Tin-
tinnabulating Tintiunabulists will now give
a selection.” Dad snorted, but paused in
the .act of removing the ear-phones. A
pleased look came into his eyes and spread
over his whiskers. “Here, Mum,” he cried,
handing over a spare set; “put these on,
quick. There’s a bloke bein’ married in
Melbin, an’ th’ fellers down there are tin-
kettlin’ him. Listen!”

“Carty Mac”: Is the sparrow driving
smaller native birds off the map? Before
it got a footing, we were accustomed to
find the home product chasing noxious
insects from gardens and orchards; now we
are greeted with the unmusical squeak of
hordes of the drab importation as it devours
everything in the shape of seed. Meanwhile
insect pests are increasing. One gardener,
finding the sparrows too cunning to accept
baits,- tried to scare them by displaying
THE TWO AWFUL EXAMPLES.
“Why don’t yer wash yer ’ands before yer sit down to dinner?”
“Gam, somethin’ bitin’ yer? Wat’s this—a gaol or a hospital?”
prominently in the back yard a stuffed eagle.
Ilis fowls at once sought cover, and the
delighted marauders partook of bran and
pollard under the protecting wings of the
dummy.
* * * *
“Biro”: One of a brood of honeyeaters
reared in our garden received extra attention
from its mother, and spent its time about
the ground. Being curious I caught the
little flutterer and examined it. On one
of its feet where claws and toes should be
tlmre are just tiny stumps. I am still unde-
cided whether I should kill it or not.
“Up North”: A rare fish found in the
waters around Stephen’s Island is the sabay,
a thick-set fellow with a spiked head; the
natives boil it down for its oil, which has
medicinal qualities. Long ago, the legend
runs, Badi, who possessed supernatural
powers over birds and fishes, lived on
Stephen’s Island. One day he carved in
wood the rough form
of a fish and threw
it into the water.
Instantly it was trans-
formed into a shoal of
swimming fish with
spikes on their heads.
Badi speared one and
cooked it in a shell.
He tried the fish on
the ants; they backed
up for more. He flung
a piece to his dog and
the tyke barked an
(neore. Some white
pigeons flew overhead
and swooped down for
their share. “It’s
killed none of ’em.”
mused Badi. He tried
some himself, and
spent the remainder of
the day spearing more.
On the western side
of Ugar Badi still
gazes out over the best
sabay ground in the
world, for he transfigured himself into a rock
towering up out of the water. On the land
behind him the natives will point you out
the fireplace where he cooked his first sabay,
and two roughly-hewn stones —the first birds
upon which he tried the fish.
* * * *
“Pfella”: I am satisfied that some spiders
can take up the slack of a released web-
line. Towards sunset I watched a West-
ralian specimen—brown body with yellow
stripes, and about 2Hn. from leg tip to leg tip.
Her fly-trap was nicely laid out in the fork
of a grape-vine, but business was quiet, and
she decided to visit a honeysuckle bush about
six feet away. When she spun the line to
bridge the gap a light breeze was blowing
from the right quarter, but it veered a point
and the loose end missed its object. Yellow
Stripes waited on the off-chance for fully five
minutes; then she calmly withdrew the
streamer, and it went in where it came. out.
A quick change of position about two feet
northward, and the long web-feeler was
played out again, this time finding a honey-
suckle twig. Yellow Stripes was over like
a shot to make all fast.
❖ ❖ ❖ *
“Prop”: I caught a budgeregar (or shell-
parrot) which had most of its feathers
turned at the end like a French fowl. It
was unable to flv beyond the long grass.
I carried it home in the quartpot and intro-
duced it into a cage of redbeaks. In a few
days the finches showed their friendliness by
trying to straighten its feathers. They gradu-
ally pulled out every one that had a tendency
to curl, paying particular attention to the
tail. Now every feather is straight, and the
little parrot can fly like a streak. Though
he will hop on anyone’s finger, he will not
allow you to touch his tail.
❖ * * *
“Momokeni”: On a coral island an ento-
mologist friend of mine set out to dig down
under a white-ants’ nest to get the queen
ant. As protection from sun and rain while
the hole was being dug. a thatched roof was
put up. After getting down 10 feet and fail-
ing to reach the queen’s chamber, the ento-
mologist tossed the job in. A few days after
he noticed a goanna at the bottom of the
pit. Knowing the climbing powers of the
reptile he was amazed, weeks later, to find
it still there. He tried to drive it out, only
to discover that a bit of overhang near the
ton kept it prisoner. He became interested
and visited the thing frequently, wondering
how long it would live without food and
water —the ants had sealed up their broken
THE RECIPE.
“Where do you get drink? You don't
earn anything.”
“Well, if you don’t let it go no further, your Worship, I’ll put you on to it. Hop in t
when there’s a shout for more than six—they don’t seem to notice the extra one?"
passage and deserted their nest. Doubtless
a few grubs, beetles and moths came its
way occasionally, but beyond these it had
no food and certainly no watch Neverthe-
less, for the four years during which I knew
it to be there, it lived and appeared to be
none the worse; on my last visit it was
quite as lively as when I first saw it.
:? * * *
“G. Bung”: Another Papuan vegetable-
sprinter is the snake-bean, which runs
“Biliai’s” vine (B. 13/10/’27) a good second
for quick growth. It is an amazing cropper,
and a dozen plants will keep an average
household fully supplied. The beans are
very tasty; the flavor is like that of French
beans. They grow well in the warmer parts
of Australia, and need little attention.
* * *
Bunny”: The little five-year-old girl from
the city clung to her mother’s hand as the
farmyard unfolded its rather fearsome
delights. Suddenly slio caught sight of a
calf-skin hanging on the fence. “Mum,” she
squealed, “who took the peeling off the cow?”
* * >]: *
“Carisbrook, Jun.”: “Mei’s” horse (B.
3/11/'27) which found its way home across
20 miles of scrub is not uncommon. A
few months ago a mob of Mt. Surprise (Q.)
horses were taken across 400 miles of drought-
stricken country to a station in the vicinity
of Croydon. They were paddocked there
for a week, and then grassed beside the only
water within 20 miles. A fortnight later
the majority of them turned up at their
home pastures at Mount Surprise; a few
even returned to the station from which
they had been brought to Mt. Surprise. In
crossing the intervening country they must
have made wide detours off the original track
to avoid fences.
* * *
“Hinemoa”: A resident of Pleasant
Point (M.L.) was motoring down wliat is
known as the long cutting when something
struck the windshield of the car and shat-
tered it. Simultaneously, screaming like a
child in pain, a hare somersaulted into the
face of a back-seat occupant, cutting his
mouth badly and dislodging several teeth.
The shower of broken glass inflicted damage
on every other passenger. Puss had evi-
dently been sitting in the road when,
dazzled by the headlights, it had leapt into
the air and gone through the shield.
:J: :Jc #
“Mata Mata” : The fact that the Papuan
native knows little about insomnia was
brought home to me when my cook boy,
with a broad grin, asked me for some murra-
murra (medicine) for his big toe. The toe
was half gnawed away, and in horror I
asked him what he had done to it. Still
smiling broadly he replied: “Sinabada, las’
night I sleep, an’ big feller rat ’e come an’
kaikai my big feller toe altogether!” “You
no wake up?” I asked incredulously. “Sina-
bada, I sleep; I no wake up,” he said. I
have often envied sound sleepers, but realise
now that in Papua at least unbroken slum-
ber may sometimes have its disadvantages.
“Returned Empty” : Touching white kan-
garoos (B. 27/10/’27). One was shot on
Beryl station, near Muttaburra (C.Q.), some
years ago. It was roughly stuffed and given
to the manager of Kensington Downs, and
is still there.
si: S': si: *
“Carisbrook. Jun.”: The Westralian
natives’ initiation ceremonies differ widely
from those of the Cape York abos. (B.
I know two white men who
witnessed the rites of the Wallal tribe. The
initiation business takes several years and
begins when the boy is about 10 years old.
He is first admitted to the lesser corrobor; es
and the minor seasonal ceremonies. Win n lie
is about 12 the circumcision corroboree t..kes
place. The boy is led back to his gunyah,
and next night undergoes the fire test. For
several consacuiive nights lie is submitted to
various other tests, and if lie sustains them
in a befitting manner is formally graduated
in man’s estate.
* '•[' * ❖
“Conger” : Not many years ago the Torres
Strait natives set great store on divination
bv skulls. The Zogo-man, gazing into the
eye-sockets of a swinging skull within the
gloomy Zogo-house, would, after half-hyp-
notising himself, ask questions about the
incoming seasons and the intentions of
enemies. The skull answered by the open-
ing and closing of its jaws, and by low his-
sing sounds, supposed to come from where
its nose had once been. The majority of
skulls were, however, useless for divination
purposes. One that had belonged to a very
clever nig., or to a Zogo-man who had been
a noted diviner, always gave the best results.
If an ordinary man felt aggrieved over a mis-
fortune, he would collect a skull (when the
owner wasn’t looking), hand it over to
the Zogo-man for formal enchantment, and
then place it on the grave of a relative as
a go-between, supplying the missing link
between him and the spirits of the dead.
He could thus convey through the new skull
a message asking the relative to square
things with the spirit concerning a matter
troubling the sender.
it: :Ji $
“Toonooba”: Along the shelving foreshores
northward from the Fitzroy mouth (C.Q.)
flat, thin plates of pearly translucency, four
inches or more in diameter, are to be found
after severe blows. They are the valves of
the curious window-glass shell placuna. The
discs have a micaceous cleavage and may be
cut into small panes. These are an unex-
ploited source of wealth in Australia; there
is a considerable demand for them in Europe
and America, where they are used in church
windows and for lantern-screens, shades and
the like. This bivalve may be farmed; at
Malabon (U.S.) oyster- and placuna-beds
are contiguous.
* * * *
“Moe”: In New Britain the favorite
method of tethering a snake until required
for the table is to tie it to a bamboo pole
by a long plaited vegetable thong. This is
fixed to the snake’s neck, wound around the
pole a couple of times and tied at its other
end to the reptile’s tail. When fastened in
this way the most energetic wriggler is help-
less. It is a common thing for the natives
to keep one for two or three days, the
ends of the pole being placed in the forks
of two trees well above the ground. While
so tethered, the snake will not for a minute
cease to wriggle; it will often keep up its
struggles for two days or more. The natives
of New Britain differ from the snake-eaters
of New Guinea in devouring only a few
choice cuts around the base of the tail; those
of the mainland eat everything except the
bones.
THE POCKET-ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It wanders from the tick-gate where the
main road’s traffic spills,
The Pocket-road that lightly winds amid the
dreaming hills,
Where long warm days of sunshine and misty
wreaths of rain
Have flung down fields of glowing green,
like emeralds in a chain.
The Pocket-road goes treading a measure
old and slow,
The while she croons a melody of days of
long ago,
When life ran not so swiftly and men had
time for dreams
As they worried out a pathway with the slow
feet of the teams.
The Poclcet-road with laughter runs up the
hills and down,
And gathers beauty in her hands to fashion
her a crown;
She loiters like a naughty child that will
for mischief seek,
And at each winding of the way she splashes
through a creek.
Oh, the Pocket-road runs lightly with her
face towards the west,
The blue sea croons behind her, and the
green hills kiss her breast,
And having lingered idly by pasture, field
and farm.
She skips across a mountain to the green
vale of Main Arm.

"Slinga” : “Poncirus” (B. 17/11/’27)
discourses soundly enough about concrete,
but he leaves out certain details. I’ve had
30 years’ experience with the stuff, and
regard it as the most valuable building
material ever introduced to Australia, so
may be excused for adding a few hints:—
Aggregate: The stone should have rough
surfaces. Smooth water-worn gravel is bad.
as there is no key for the cement and sand
to grip. Stone should be “knapped” or broken
until no piece is larger than two inches in
any thickness.
In heavy work such as floors for garages,
tankstands, etc., “plums” of solid stone may
be inserted, but these should .be of such size
that not less than two inches of concrete can
be laid all round them top and bottom, and
not less than, six inches between them.
Otherwise they form a lino of weakness.
Small stone and chips are useful, as they
help to fill interstices, and hard bricks,
broken up, are excellent.
Sand: This must be . sharp or gritty.
Dusty, “floury” stuff such as wind-blown
desert sand is not good—there is no “key”
to it.
Cement: There are plenty of good Austra-
lian cements on the market. Cement must
be kept dry before use. It is highly hygro-
scopic ; that is, it will absorb moisture just
as lime or salt does, from the atmosphere.
Before mixing, all lumps must be rubbed or
rolled to reduce them again to dust. Dis-
card any lumps that are flinty, as these
have set and arc useless. A bag contains li
cub. ft. of cement.
Water: About 20 per cent, by volume of
the mixed concrete is required. Avoid mak-
ing the mixture sloppy. A rough test is to
squeeze a fistful in the hand, when water
should just exude.
Sea water can be used, but soft water is
best. Water containing vegetable matter —
such as peat—is bad. So is water contain-
ing acid. . Water containing lime or gypsum
or chalybeates is all right, although it may
cause a slight variation in the time of set-
ting.
Proportions of materials (all measured by
bulk, not by weight) : For reinforced con-
crete or best-quality work: 1 part cement,
2 parts sand, 4 parts stone.
For medium work such as walls, founda-
tions and floors: 1 cement, 2| sand, 5 stone.
For heavy walls (not walls of tanks) :
1 cement, 3 sand, 6 stone.
The following table shows the quantities
of the materials required for one cubic
yard of concrete in the various proportions
given above :
Proportion. Cement, Sand, Stone,
lb.. cub. yd. cub. yd.
1:2:4 548 .45 .90
1:21:5 450 .46 .92
1 : 3" : 6 383 .47 .94
It will be seen that the total of the three
quantitites for any one proportion amounts
to more than one cub. yd. This is because
the cement and sand flow into the inter-
stices between the stones. In the 1,2, 4
mixture, for example, to make 27 cub. ft.
of concrete the quantities would be: Cement
6.75 cub. ft., sand 12.15, stone 24.30, total
33.2 cub. ft.
Gauging: In order to get the right pro-
portion it is essential to use a box-gauge.
It is convenient to make this so that it holds
a definite part or fraction of a cubic foot.
Construct of 3in i lin. scantling a box-
frame without either top or bottom, Sin.
square b l ' 3in. deep, inside measurement.
Now Bin. x Sin. x 3in. equals 192 cubic
inches, or one-ninth of a cub. ft.
The gauge is placed on the mixing-board,
described later, and filled just flush with the
top with sand, cement or- stone, so many of
each, according to the mix required.
A good method is to measure the stone
first, then the sand, until you have half
the amount of these, then all the cement
required, then on top of that the remainder
of the stone and sand. This prevents the
cement being blown away when you begin
to mix it. .
Mixing-board: It is a waste of time to
use too small a board. A board 4ft. square
is convenient. The bottom of a galvanised-
iron tank is useful. The board should be
even-surfaced, with no cracks through which
the water can run taking with it the
cement. In an emergency a tarpaulin can
be used, but will soon be ruined.
Mixing: The board being placed level and
bandy to the job to be done, pile the mixture
on it dry. For amateur work, single-handed,
two cubic feet is as much as can con*
w.-.eiuiy be handled at one mix.
Take the 1-3-6 mix as an . example. The
total “units” are I+3 + 6, making 10.
Now, since the gauge holds one-nintli of a
cub. ft., 20 gauges will be a little more than
2 cub. ft.—just a nice bulk to handle.
Put the gauge on the board, fill with
broken stone, lev.el off, lift tlie gauge, level
the pih; of stone, replace gauge, refill.
Repeat six times in all. Now do the same
three times with sand. Then, fill the gauge
twice with cement, then three times with
sand and then six times with stone.
Turn over thoroughly with a shovel three
times, working from one side, at the bottom,
to the other and back again. Flatten out
the top and make a hole. Pour in about a
gallon of water and turn the dry mix into
it. being careful none runs away taking
with it the cement.
When the water is absorbed, flatten out,
make the hole again and repeat until you
have the stuff the right consistency. About
41 gals, of water will bo required. Then
give the whol ■ mix two or three times over,
seeing that there are no “dry” patches or
sloppy “pockets” in it. You are now ready
to put tlie concrete into place and ram
lightly.
Calculations: Many people waste time and
money by neglecting to calculate the amount
of the various materials required. It is
useless to pile up a lot of cement that will
only deteriorate. Far better to buy just
what you require as necessary.
Take a simple example: It is required
to put a floor 6in. thick in a motor-garage
12ft. x 20ft. What materials are necessary?
12ft. x 20ft. x Ift. equals 120 cub. ft. of
concrete, or 4$ cub. yds. Use the 1-2+5
mixture. The quantities required are:
Cement, 4.5 cub. yds. x 4501 b. per cub. yd.,
20251 b 17 bags ; sand, 4.5 cub. yds.
x .46 (see table), 2.07 cub. yds.; stone, 4.5
x .92, 4.14 cub. yds.
WHEAT-GROWING IN THE MALLEE.
“Glenfield”: To the observant Mallec
cocky the experience of this dry year should
be of untold value, for the dry times will
assuredly come again.
Outstanding observations are that early
and well-cultivated fallow is essential. Early
sowing shows well-formed heads standing
well out of the shot blade and containing
plump grain, in marked contrast to late
sowing, where the heads are only half de-
veloped and contain shrivelled grain. Light
dressings of super, prove to be a penny-wise-
and-pound-foolish policy. Where 901 b. super,
is applied to the acre the plants are well
stooled, with no signs of burning off and
free from disease, compared with spindly
short growth and an excess of weeds where
super, has been skimped. The use of drought-
resisting varieties of seed, bred by the Agri-
cultural Department to stand dry conditions,
has proved their worth. These varieties have
been tested on Government plots over a
series of years, and it is remarkable that
they are not more generally sown. Finally,
the practice of sowing stubble land, except
after a drought year, only enlarges the bank
overdraft.
TAKE-ALL IN WHEAT.
“Burrum” : Take-all in wheat is a serious
disease in the Wimmera and Mallee, at least.
Vic. Ag. Dep. recommends that the stubbles
be burnt, the fallowing done early, and
fallows kept clean. It also notes that taka-
all is less prevalent after the growing of
oats, and less liable to occur on red soils
than on black. The recommendation and
observations seem to be based on the acci-
dental discoveries of farmers, but are none
the less valuable. The starvation, by de-
priving the fungi spores of a host when oats
are grown, is a means of repression almost
as mechanical as fallowing. The difference
in results on various classes of soils is not
such a simple matter to explain.
It is well known that lime soils pre-
dispose plants to many diseases, many of
which may be noticed on badly-worked Wim-
mera black soils. On the other hand, potash
and iron in soils are antagonistic to many of
the same diseases. Chlorosis in plants is
akin to anaemia in man, and arises from a
variety of causes, as many as in man’s com-
plaint. As may be sunnosed, a slight touch
of that disease in plants makes them more
susceptible to other more definite diseases.
An excess of lime predisposes to chlorosis.
A sufficiency of potash and iron, particu-
larly iron, counteracts it. In the Wimmera
black and red soils under my observation,
the potassic and iron contents are much the
same in both types. But their value as
fungicides in the red may be counteracted
and superseded in the black by that soil s
far greater proportion of lime (0.2 p.c. lime
in red, 4 p.c. in black —20 times as much).
The theory receives more solid support in a
quite definite statement of Bourcart, who
says take-all may be prevented by burying
in the soil 701 b. of green vitriol (sulphate ot
iron) per acre.
A. H. Renard gives sulphate of iron more
than a good mention, though not naming
take-all particularly as one of the diseases
it is efficacious in preventing. When it is
remembered that the probability of a take-
all infested crop is the only thing that pre-
vents many farmers from sowing stubble
land, the value of a cheap and certain pre-
ventive is obvious.
THE N.S.W. “WHEAT BELT.”
• “Whoatear”: Isn’t it about time that
someone unbuckled the wheat belt and
pushed it further north? Ever since that
mythical girdle was fastened round the waist
of N.S.W. there has been a fixed idea in the
mind of the agriculturist, and he (or most
of him, anyway) would no more think of
attempting wheat-culture outside of the
charmed circle than he would of breeding
elephants. But there was a time when wheat
was harvested in the Southern Tablelands,
and an excellent sample it was. Back in the
’fifties, and later, Goulburn maintained three
big flour-mills which were kept going with
local wheat, and the flour found a ready
market. Further back still, a water-mill
on the Wollondilly was kept going solely
on local wheat, and the flour and offal
was carted in bullock-waggons to Sydney.
If wheat paid then, why not to-day, when
a tractor can do the work of four horses?
There is still land available, and wheat is a
good crop to follow spuds.
A FLAX-GROWING EXPERIMENT.
“W.P.D.”: An editorial (B. 17/11/’27)
comments on the small quantiy of flax grown
in the Commonwealth at present, and states
that the quantity produced in Victoria is
negligible. But things may be better before
long. Mr. Greig, an A.I.F. man, after the
war inspected all aspects of the flax industry
in Britain and on the Continent, and, con-
vinced of the necessity of finding a more
economical way of separating the fibre from
the straw, designed improved machinery for
the purpose. Finding no opening for his
invention in the Old Country, he moved his
plant to Drysdale (Vic.) and improved it in
the direction of obtaining a greater percent-
age of long fibre to the ton and lessening the
difficulties of dealing with the straw in wet
weather.
He induced a number of farmers in the dis-
trict to grow flax and bought their crops at
£5 per ton. Yields have averaged two tons to
the acre and go up to three tons. The flax
is cut and harvested with a reaper and
binder, like hay, and delivered at the mill
without the cost of stacking and rehandling.
It is claimed that the Drysdale plant will
make possible the development of the flax
industry in Australia, and allow the mill
to compete in the London market against
European fibre.
Rope and string manufacturers in Vic-
toria are helping the new industry to their
fullest ability and are using the fibre in their
products. Probably a much larger quantity
could be disposed of immediately and ab-
sorbed by local manufacturers, and inquiries
show that the demand for the fibre is increas-
ing, while British mill-owners are favorably
impressed with the quality of the product
and can take it at a price which will leave
a profit to the producer. From 100 tons of
flax as delivered by the grower, 20 tons of
fibre are produced, 15 tons of linseed and
65 tons of straw. The straw, by the new
process, can be converted into chaff which
cattle and sheep eat with avidity.
Experiments in flax-growing have also
been tried in Queensland, and where there
is a fair rainfall during the winter months
the crop will flourish. The reason why it
■was not persevered with was the lack of
a market for the crop.
CHAMPION MILKERS.
“St. Rawberry”: Ere “Milker” (B.
l/12/’27) is overwhelmed with entrants for
the milkers’ championship, let me issue a
word of warning. The man who milks more
than eight cows in full milk within 60
minutes is not doing his job properly.
To sit down to each cow with the grim
intention of buzzing her off within five
minutes is to invite trouble. The careful,
steady stripping-out of a cow is essential,
for it is this that induces the secretion of
larger quantities of milk. A cow makes milk
more or less at will, literally turns blood
into milk when she feels so inclined; so if
handled easily and leisurely she will produce
juice actually whilst being milked. But grab
her lactatory appendages and haul out iust
what she has kindly made whilst standing
in the yard or bail, and you’ll surely rob
yourself of a gill of milk —just work out the
value of a gill per cow twice a day in a herd
of 30 for 12 months. Aren’t the extra few
minutes worth while? Now, let’s hear from
the assassin who does "15 an hour —easily:’
MILK RECORDS AND FEEDING. !
“J.H.8.” : “Azac’s” remarks on faked dairy
records (B. 10/11/’27) display ignorance of
the subject. He seems to consider that to
get milk out of a cow you just pour a lot of
food down her neck and stick a bucket under-
neath. If Strawberry or Wagga Gladys, or
whatever her name, is given too much food
she has to sleep it off and forgets to attend
to her job of making milk.
As a matter of fact, to produce a record-
making cow the feeding is begun long before
she starts her lactation period and goes on
with a careful regularity until she has
finished. Any such irregularities as “Azac”
suggests would immediately upset Straw-
berry and turn off the milk-tap sufficiently
to put all thought of a record out of mind.
PLEUROPNEUMONIA IN CATTLE.
“Dingo”: Pleuro-pneumonia, which has
been steadily on the increase in N.S.W. dur-
ing the past two years, lias recently invaded
the metropolitan area. Of purely bovine
diseases it ranks second only to rinderpest
as a killer, but is easily restrained by inocu-
lation and quarantine. Most of the N.S.W.
outbreaks can be traced to “carriers” (re-
covered animals) from Queensland. For
obvious reasons dealers and agents bitterly
resent the imposition of quarantine restric-
tions, and Sydney and suburban dairymen,
who are nearly all forced to buy cattle. on
credit at some time or other, are frequently
terrorised into concealing the disease. The
registration of veterinary surgeons and ino'cu-
lators has proved a step in the right direc-
tion, but the notification of infectious disease
in stock required by the Stock Diseases Act
is still very difficult to enforce!
Strange to say, preventive inoculation
agai.-sc iueuro-pimunionia w.tii natural virus
from the clmst cavity, which has done: so
much towards stamping out the disease in
Australia, is still regarded as more or less
useless by a large percentage of English
and Continental veterinary authorities.
FIGHTING GRASS-GRUBS.
“Tahune” : The Speck’s pasturage has in
recent years suffered much from the. rav-
ages of grass-grubs, and the trouble is in-
creasing. There are two varieties —the corbie
(or. oncopera) and the perina. The first-
named is a white or beetle grub, and the
perina is a moth. The corbie is difficult to
deal with owing to its habit of burrowing
about nine inches into the earth. Heavy
rains give it a set-back, but in dry seasons
it flourishes. At the instance of the Federal
Government, Dr. R. J. Tillyard has been
investigating, and suggests using the Maori-
land vegetable caterpillar, or club-headed
fungus, as an antidote to the perina. But
there is no need for imports, as Tds. has
four or five distinct species of its own. Vege-
table caterpillars, so called, belong to a group
of fungi known as Cordyceps, which thrive
upon living or dead insects and grubs.
Myriads of spores are shed freely and widely
distributed on to leaves and undergrowth.
A caterpillar, or grub, in feeding transports
the spores to its alimentary canal, where
they germinate and grow, penetrating the
wail of the insect’s intestine. The caterpillar,
not relishing the inward trouble, buries itself
in the soil and the fungus flourishes apace
—eventually absorbing the whole tissue of
its host but leaving the outer mould or
covering intact. The Cordyceps, with re-
production in view, sends up a shoot -in
some cases a foot above ground. This carries
a small bulrush-shaped tip, in which myriads
of spores are evolved and distributed for
fresh mediums to repeat the process.
I have found dozens of the freak in which
every wrinkle of the caterpillar is retained,
the original internal substance being replaced
by the fungoid growth.
A WORD FOR ELECTROCULTURE.
“Silentio”: Writers on this page have
been cynical about the value of electrical
current as a seed stimulant, but there s
at least one practical man who believes in it
and makes a good thing out of it. That is
Alex. Bennett, of Fairfield (N.S.W.), who
works wonders with flowers and vegetables
on an area of ground that looks most unpro-
mising. His treated seeds have been tried
out in most States with excellent results.
From a special battery current is applied to
the seeds; this is said to aid germination
and productivity, and also to act as a pre-
ventive of many plant diseases. A special
case is the wilt in tomatoes. It is claimed
that plants raised from seed electrically
treated have flourished when the disease has
outed non-electrified plants. Plenty of water
is one of the essentials to the success of
treated seed, the soil being a secondary con-
sideration. Rock-melons of lSlb.. cabbage of
301 b. and marrows of 351 b. have been grown,
and one grower in Vic. claims to have taken
over 40 tons of tomatoes off an acre. Ben-
nett also doctors sick plants, applying cur-
rent from apparatus made by himself, the
results being wonderfully successful.

Dodge Brothers Four supports the contention of
leading automotive engineers that the car of the
future will be comparatively light and of medium
wheelbase.
For it will travel rough roads with greater com-
fort than other cars of its weight, and forge its
way through traffic as no larger car can do
with safety.
Dodge Brothers motor has always been noted
for economy of fuel and oil, but in this new Four
with the famous “124” motor, oil economy is
made more certain by an improved lubrication
system and petrol consumption is reduced one
fifth.

RATS.
“Koolonga” : Tell “Bill R.”(B. 10/11/ 27)
that a more certain method of scaring rats
than using caustic soda has been tried with
success on many stations in Victoria. Trap
a rat, half-roast it over a fire, and leave the
carcase in a place where the pests are sure
to find it. I haven’t struck a case yet where
they hadn’t all cleared out for good before
24 hours was up.
A different method was practised by a
man who wanted live rats for vivisection
purposes, but it was just as good in ridding
a place of the pests. Finding a rat-run, he
would leave several saucers of overproof
sweet wine about in the evening and do the
rounds to collect the drunkards sliortly after
midnight. I know it was useless for him to
have a second try at a run, because he
worked my sheds one night two years ago
and there hasn’t been a rat here since. The
teetotal rats evidently were alarmed at the
disappearance of their drunken mates and
took warning.
BULRUSHES IN DRAINS.
“N.M.L.”: There’s no cure for bulrushes
in drains, but they can be prevented. I
treated a drain about 20 years ago, and for
three years while I was there it never grew
a rush worth troubling about. I hear it is
still free. When first a new drain is run,
five or six rushes to the mile will show them-
selves. If those baby rushes are lifted out
clean, right to the furthest tendril of their
roots, and thrown away clear of the drain;
they’ll wither in the sun in a few hours.
Next week there’ll be three or four to the
mile. Lift them out clear and clean and
let the sun attend to ’em. Next week there’ll
ne two or three to the mile. Treat ditto.
From that on, with longer periods between
inspections, there’ll be but one rush showing
itself every here and there about two to three
miles apart. That drain may be left unat-
tended for a month. A man may ride along
it and put it in perfect order again with a
minimum of trouble. It’s set for ever with
reasonable care.
CITRUS BUD-SELECTION.

wrong in suggesting that Luther Burbank s
methods arc of much use to anyone desirous
of propagating good-type citrus-trees. Bur-
bank is chiefly famous for having fathered
new varieties of fruits (mostly deciduous)
by “fixing” or perpetuating new types from
mutations, either natural or arising from his
hybridisation experiments. Mutations appear
in deciduous fruits only amongst seedlings,
and practically never from budding, whereas
citrus-trees are notorious for mutations from
budding. Indeed, it is only because it is
comparatively easy to fix new types of plums,
peaches, etc., by bud-propagation from sport
seedlings that so many different varieties of
each deciduous fruit exist. Burbank was
always chasing new varieties of plums,
peaches, etc., whereas the citrus man is fran-
tically doing the exact opposite, trying to
keep the old strain true.
No citrus-grower on a commercial basis
wants to fiddle about “for perhaps 20 years
or so,” as “W.N.F.” advises, in order to
develop a profitable citrus grove. Most of
us want to make money at the game before
we die rather than present posterity with
the result of an experiment which may prove
a failure anyhow. The Valencia and Wash-
ington Navel, of which there are thousands
of trees scattered about Australia, continu-
ously bear heavy crops of perfect fruit. In
propagating citrus for commercial planting
all we require is to keep true to these per-
fect types, and we can do so in one genera-
tion of trees if we know how and are in
luck. A. D. Shamel, the famous citricul-
turist, advises that not only must one choose
parent trees of proved quality and quantity
production, but also cut buds only from twigs
which are actually carrying perfect-type
fruits, the citrus-tree being so liable to
mutations that even the next twig may pro-
duce off-type progeny. Shamel’s method has
long since, at Riverside and other Californian
centres, been proved to produce the greatest
percentage of true-to-parent-type citrus-
trees.
But no method can be relied upon to pro-
duce the desirable 100 per cent., and there is
just as much likelihood of “W.N.F.’s” fourth
or forty-fourth generation producing a big
percentage of off-type trees as was the case
with the first generation. “W.N.F.’s” ideas
of a continuity of selection are right for
almost every living thing except citrus. A
perfect orange is a perfect orange, and that’s
all there is to it, but no sheep, cow or horse
is so perfect that it could not be improved
upon.
Of course, quantity production must be
considered, but provided the parent tree
is perfect in quality and not a shy bearer,
the quantity production of the progeny if
true to type depends almost entirely upon
the soil, cultivation, fertilisation and general
management of the grove.
POULTRY-KEEPINO FOR
ORCIIARDISTS.
“Milltraek”: “.Tack Point” (B. 24/11/’27)
touches on the fringe of a very interesting
subject when he asserts “there’s money in
ehooks.” Part'cularly might this apply to
orchardists. and it has always been a source
of wonder to me that more of them have not
seen the possibilities of the industry run in
conjunction with their present occupation.
An old friend of mine in the Somerville dis-
trict (Vic.) who works 30 aci’es of apples
also runs upwards of 2000 fowls throughout
his orchard, and in consequence not only
ruts his manure bill to a minimum and keeps
the insect pests down, but actually pays the
working expenses of his orchard and usually
has a tidy balance to bank. The average
orchardist would, of course, find a flock of
that size rather a handful, but. by starting
in a small way. buying a few good birds or
settings (and they must be good), he could
in a couple of years, with average managerial
care, confidently look forward to a profit of
£1 per 100 birds per week, and that without
devoting much more of his time to them
than he now gives to the dozens of nonde-
script fowls one usually sees running round
any orchard or farm.
COTTON IN QUEENSLAND.
“Mapee”: The coming cotton season in
Queensland will probably decide whether the
industry is to peter out altogether or go
ahead and become firmly established, as its
supporters hope and believe it will. The
output has been steadily decreasing since
1924, the boom year; last seasons total
production being 4800 bales of cotton lint,
and about 2000 short tons of seed. L
production drops much below these figures
it is questionable if it will pay io
operate the ginneries and oil-milling machin-
ery necessary to prepare the product for
market. In its renewed agreement with the
Cotton Board the 8.A.C.A., which owns and
operates all the ginneries in the State and
the oil-mill at Whinstanes, stipulates that it
will only pay the full price per ton agreed
on provided a minimum of 4000 tons is
delivered. This means that unless last sea-
son’s crop is at least doubled the grower will
not be receiving full value for his product,
and the industry wants all the return it can
get at this critical stage. However, the
season so far has been exceptionally good,
and indications are that there will be a record
crop for the acreage planted.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Boronia”: The method recommended by
“J.G.” (B. 10/11/’27) to prevent heavily-
laden fruit-trees from breaking down is
easily the best one. He should have added
that when the winter-pruning is being done
the wires should be released. Unless this is
done there is a danger of the wire cutting
into the bark when the sprig-sap starts to
rise and causes the branches to swell.
“P.A.”; For young stock such as foals,
calves and pigs limewater is very useful.
Add half a bag of slaked lime to a cask of
rainwater and stir well. When it settles
it forms a clear, colorless and odorless liquor.
It can be given without fear to young stock.
Apart from being a mineral constituent in
food, it acts as a corrective and anti-acid,
and renders curd in milk less dense and more
digestible. When empty the cask can be
filled with water again as lime dissolves
gradually. When the mixture loses its
peculiar flavor more lime should be added.
“Mullarula”: When a cattle brand hap-
pens to be too hot and burns too deeply, the
result is often a hard liorn-like growth.
Sooner or later this gets knocked off, and
the result is a running sore which never
heals if left to itself. An animal so afflicted
is liable to lose condition, and may die.
About as much arsenic as can be put on a
sixpenny bit, dropped into the sore, will eat
away all the corruption and leave nothing
but a scar. A beast so treated should be
put in a crush where there is not room for
it to turn round, and left there for a few
hours. Otherwise the poison may be licked
off by the patient or some of its mates, with
disastrous results. . .
“Poncirus”: Fumigine on citrus fruits,
caused by brown olive scale, wax scale and
aphis, may be easily removed by damp
sawdust. Place a quantity of the sawdust
in a cliaffbag with about a bushel of fruit
and with a person at each end of the bag
vigorously shake and roll the fruit back-
wards and forwards for two or three
minutes. Practically all the smut will be
removed, the fruit is brightened up and a
shilling a case is added to the value of the
fruit. . .
“Hop Scrub”: There is a simpler and
more permanent system of bracing fruit
trees than the “Maypole” type of support.
Use screw eyes or staples in the main limbs.
To these fasten pieces of 12-gauge galvanised
wire and attach the ends of these wires to
a steel ring. 2in. in diameter, so that the
wires radiate from the main limbs to the
ring which should be in the centre of the
circle which any well-pruned tree forms.
The staples won’t harm the tree and the
wire braces interfere less with such orchard
operations as pruning, spraying or apple-
snatching than any other form of support.
The weight is distributed equally around the
tree and the wire-braced tree will stand up
to the heaviest crop. The Californians have
proved it.
“Barangkali”: The large pineapple plan-
tations of Hawaii adopt a method of keep-
ing down weeds which might be followed
by Australian fruitgrowers. After the
ground has been prepared for planting, layers
of mulch-paper, three feet wide, are put
down for miles on end. The young pineapple
plants are planted through the paper, just
leaving enough foliage showing through to
ensure a healthy growth. It is claimed by
the planters that the paper keeps the earth
at an even temperature and holds the mois-
ture in. In Hawaii last year 18,000 miles
of this paper was used.
“N.M.L.”: Should a horse show reluctance
to step backwards take in your hand the
loose skin under the animal’s neck at about
the point where the neck joins the brisket.
Gather that skin in your hand, pinch slightly
and press a trifle in the direction in which
you wish the animal to go.
“Curlew”: The vet.’s invariable prescrip-
tion for ringworm in cattle and mange in
dogs is iodine, which is comparatively ex-
pensive, very volatile, and not readily acces-
sible in the bush. One part of kerosene to
three parts of oil, preferably raw linseed, is
just as good. One dressing is enough. Apply
with a paint-brush. The mixture is excel-
lent also for cuts and sores and is a horse-
breaker’s remedy for girth galls.
“Two Seas”: For blocking watercourses
under rabbit-proof fences I have found
plain galvanised-iron suspended from the
bottom of the fence far more serviceable than
the length of wire netting recommended by
“Pick” : Where there isn’t time for attend-
ing to framed beehives, but one or two
swarms are kept to provide the home with
honey, box the bees in an ordinary sound
case with a two-inch square hole cut
through the top centre. Over this hole tack
a strip of queen excluding zinc—then fit
another smaller box above, leaving no means
of entrance except through the zinc. After
filling the lower box the working bees will
pass through the zinc and use up the space
provided by the upper storey, but the queen
being shut out, there will I,herein be no brood
comb. At any time this compartment may
be lifted, and the honeycomb extracted,
without disturbing the bees or destroying
the brood comb.

AUSTRALIAN CROOKS’ WEEK.
“F.S.” : Australian Authors’ Week having
been such a success, an Australian Crooks’
Week was inaugurated, the convener being
Mr. Fagin O’Moses, the well-known receiver.
The proceedings took a willing turn from
the start. Mr. Sikes-East. 8.A., whose cul-
ture is the pride of the Underworld, threw
a bombshell into the reception given by the
Motion-picture Producers’ Association, by
denouncing the unpatriotic subservience of
its members to Hollywood. The Americau
crook had made the American film world-
famous. Would anybody have the hardi-
hood to assert that the Australian crook was
inferior in any way to liis brother across
the Pacific? Yet Aus-
tralian picture - pro-
d ucers consistently
ignored him. The
speaker gave point to
his remarks by hur-
riedly departing with
tile watches of all the
members of the com-
mittee.
In liis Crooks’ Week
sermon the Bishop of
Collingscray said that
there was dark as well
as light in Nature.
Without Vice there
could be no such thing
as Virtue. If mankind
were perfect what
Would there be to
preach about? The
crooks were discharg-
ing a necessary func-
tion of society.
Mr. O’Moses made
an impassioned appeal
over the radio for the
people not to be
ashamed of what had
maliciously been called
their Birthstain. It
had laid the founda-
tions of his fortunes as
well as of many others.
The Australian
Journalists’ Associa-
tion gave a magnificent
banquet. The guests of honor included re-
presentatives of every degree of villainy.
The chairman said that no true newspaper
man would ever forget his indebtedness to
the Underworld. The steady way in which
it maintained the flow of crime from day
to day was most praiseworthy.
The Week was terminated with a touching
ceremony. Golden handcuffs, broken, were
laid on the grave of “Squizzy” Taylor.
BECOMING.
“Becomes her,” was the highest praise
In good Queen Vic.’s censorious days
For everything that young Eve wore;
Now what the modern miss displays
Becomes her more and more.

RETROSPECT.
Dear, our poor understanding
Forbade us realise
That Fortune fair was handing
To us a noble prize:
When our hearts with love were thrilling
In the noon of a radiant day,
And you got twelve eggs for a shilling
Or a mug of beer for a tray.
Reaped fields appear the barest
That bore the plumpest grain;
Scenes that are far seem fairest —
Youth will not come again.
Jlut nothing shall ever cozen
My dreams from our joyous lot,
When eggs ivere a deener a dozen
And ale was threepence a pot.

in South Australia.”
P.P.: “The couples all wait in a queue;
I put it, your Honor, that you,
Might take ’em by dozens and do
The job quicker. ’
Judge: “If this thing increases, I see,
South Aus’ll have one big decree.”

BYSOM AUBREE.
BILL’S CAR.
Dad Jupp mistrusted cars. Returning
home late at night in his buggy, he always
viewed with alarm their searciilights playing
upon his horse. Old Dobbin would prick h.s
ears and distend his nostrils. He hated
motors, too.
Dad loved his horses so well that he even
begrudged young Bill the use of one; and
there was trouble whenever Bill returned
late from a dance. “Keepin’ the • horse
bangin’ around the hall till all hours.” Dad
would growl.
At the first opportunity Bill put down a
deposit on a second-hand car ; and it was a
great day when he drove his ’bus to the
farmhouse door.
“Come on, all of yer,” he yelled. “Hop
in an’ I’ll drive yer ’round.”
Mum came out of the kitchen and proudly
took her place beside the driver. The girls
and young Jimmy tumbled into the back
seat.
Dad, at work on the lower paddock, viewed
with astonishment the wobbling advance of
the vehicle as his family paid him a visit.
“Have yer all gorn mad?” he roared.
“Bill’s bought a car,” Mum explained.
■ “From the sound,” said Dad, “he’s got a
chaffcutter."
Bill colored. “It’ll be all right when 1
understand it better,” he said.
But his hopes were not realised. The
longer lie had the car the more it rattled, and
the longer it spent with its bonnet up at
the side of the road.
It was Mum who raised the first objection
to Bill's car; Bill so often didn’t arrive home
till the early hours of the morning, and a
horse would be much less likely to break
down than a car, she said.
As Mum’s antipathy grew Dad’s distaste
abated. He found that farmers who owned
cars were always earlier at the creamery
than he was. As he had begrudged Bill the
use of a horse, lie did not care to borrow
the car; but he realised its advantages.
When Mum’s birthday arrived Bill grew
thoughtful. He drove into the township and
returned on foot, in his hands a parcel con-
taining a present of a dress length.
“I thought you said you had no money,”
his mother exclaimed in surprise. Bill
grinned. “I sold the car,” he explained.
“Sold the car!” Mum and the girls echoed.
“Aw,” Bill explained, “it was always
breakin’ down. Made me look a goat, stickin'
me up along the road. I’m goin’ ter buy a
horse.”
“What did yer get fer it?” asked young
Jimmy.
“Forty quid,” Bill exclaimed. “Where’s
Dad?”
“Gone inter the township,” answered
Mum. “It’s a wonder you never saw him.”
A lively tooting along the drive sent the
family outside the door.
“It’s Dad!” a chorus of voices announced.
With a rattle and creak, an ancient motor
drew up at the yard gate.
“I thought I’d be earlier with the cream if
T had a car,” Dad said. “S<> I got a mate
fer Bill’s.”
A SHORT CUT.
The son of the house had drawn closer.
Carefully he scrutinised the ancient ’bus.
Then he pronounced his verdict. “It’s my
old car!” he declared.
“Eh?” ejaculated Dad.
“I said it’s my old car,” Bill explained.
“I sold it to Jenkins this morning.”
“What did he give yer fer it?” Dad asked
in a whisper.
“Forty quid,” said the son.
Dad Jupp groaned.
“What did you pay fer it?” Bill ques-
tioned.
Dad spat viciously. “Eighty bloomin'
quid,” he roared. “The dirty itiief!”

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
THERE is a time when all good men and
a lot who aren’t and never have been
good feel as if they ought to go to a
party. Even the ultra-good, who die young,
get the feeling in dreams sometimes —the
feeling that there isn't any past or future,
hut only an extremely objectionable present
which calls for obliteration. How you oblit-
erate it, either dreaming or waking, is a
matter of individual taste.
Alick McPherson had quarrelled with
Jean. Jean was once a girl and was now
a woman. She was Alick’s Avife. She had
been in that condition for eight years, and
this Avas the first time they had had a real
quarrel. That might'have been a beautiful
thought to look back upon had she paused
to think of it, but she had not paused.
Instead, in a moment of almost lyric frenzy,
.she told Alick she Avas sick of the sight of his
silly fat face. ■
That Avould hurt if the Jean in the case
Avere as homely as a biscuit-barrel. But
when Jean is still a strapping lass, and
sonsy forbye, it deals Man a nasty dig in
his spiritual solar plexus, Avhieli is Avhere
he keeps his vanity.
Hence Alick, with a feeling that the
heavens had been rent asunder, the earth
devastated and the sea dried up, rushed out
of the house .and sought balm of the sort
they sell across a tall counter Avith a damp-
proof top.
These things befell in the spacious days of
old when, if you went adventuring like that,
you could go on and on and on, even if you
only drank beer, until the past became a dim
recollection of things that happened to some-
one else, the future a groundless super-
stition and the present a particularly amus-
ing chapter in a very funny book.
By 8 p.m. Alick was moving through a
rosy-hued kaleidoscope in which the only dark
bits of glass were thost that fitfully showed
the sonsy—l insist on the adjective—Jean
declaiming vindictively about a fat .face. A
disagreeable vision, and one calling for
another and another cup to drown the
memory of the impertinence.
Swept into the ambit of the jlream by the
fell clutch of circumstance swims the fine
commanding figure and appealing, if slightly
passe, face of Kate McShane. They came
together at ten o’clock, and it was a case
of love at first, or possibly double, sight.
She was working a beer-pump. Has anyone
ever noticed the large number of exception-
ally beautiful and superior women who used
to operate those things after about nine at
night? They became innumerable near the
end of a perfect day.
They spoke, exactly of Avhat it boots not
to repeat. I think that Alick, his native
caution relaxed by the hour, the place, the
potations and the dear one all together, must
have spoken of his unhappy domestic plight.
He may even have spoken, such Avas the
transparent candor of this deeply injured
soul when in drink, of the crisis that had
Avrecked his life. As I think I said before,
it boots not.
It is very painful to me to have to write
the next sentence. Alick—or it may have
been Kate (see Genesis for confirmation of
theory)—seems to have suggested that they
need not necessarily part when the clock
chimed the hour of curfew. It was ten or
eleven or some such two-figure amount in
those days.
So it came about that when the clocks of
the town, one after the other —-you know
what town clocks are—-were broadcasting
their twice-a-day record performance in the
art of reiteration, Alick and Kate were in
Kate’s boudoir. She slept on the licensed
premises, as most bar-ladies did in that day
and generation. A bottle of that fragrant
liquid which the Scots say is the only thing
to which the word Scotch is applicable was
a silent third party to the conversation —
silent save when it punctuated the proceed-
ings with a pleasant guggle—and it was
ably supported, as the theatrical critics ivill
say, by a soda-syphon and two tumblers.
All might have gone as ill as you could
expect or hope had not Alick, after an inter-
lude devoted to candid and glowing references
to Kate’s personal charms, most of which
were on view, reverted to the subject of
Jean and his matrimonial tribulations. He
gave a sketch of the idyllic happiness of
his courting days in faraway Aberdeen, and
deplored the terrible change that had com©
over his spouse in the intervening eight
years. Not but that she was still a per-
sonable body and fair to look upon. Alick
insisted on that.
At the mention of Aberdeen (in the orig-
inal Doric, into AA'hich Alick had relapsed
under the influence of the national beverage,
there are five r’s in the word, or maybe
six) Kate McShane Avent silent for a space.
She was looking back across the gulf of the
years while Alick went on talking. It was
in Aberdeen that Kate first went a-roaming
in the gloaming, and the memories were
bitter-sweet. “Ouai,” she said at length,
“I’m frae Aiberrrdeen mysel’, and I had
mony a sweethairt there. D’ye mind that
graund auld Scottish song ‘Ben Bolt’? I’ll
sing it for ye.” And she lifted up her voice
and sang, not raucously as you might have
expected, but in a thin little silvery soprano
full of tears. But it wasn’t “Ben Bolt” she
sang:—
And my fause 10-over sto-ole the ro-ose
An’ 0-011I3' le eft the thor-orn behind.
“Wumman,” said Alick solemnly, “ye sing
like a Florence Nightingale. Ye sing like
Jean, an’ she has a voice that maks bairnies
greet.”
“Is it that awfu’?” asked Kate in all
sincerity.
“Awfu’? Wlia said it was awfu’?” snorted
Alick. “I’m tellin’ ye she can sing like a
gramophone. I mind me things that she sings
that bring tears to my een wi’ the pure pathos
of it all. There’s ‘Auld Lang Syne,’ an’ ‘Scots
Wha Ilae,’ an’ ‘Everybody’s Daein’ It’ an’ the
like. It’s juist pathetic. An’ tae think we
were that happy an’ contentit in oor ain
wee but an’ ben, wi’ a t.-p. piano-player
an’ a mairble clock an’ twa china dogs
on the mantelpiece; an’ then she up air
tells me she’s sick o’ the sicht o’ ma silly
fat face. I ask ye, Kate, I ask ye as mon
tae mon, if anny wife has the ,richt tae say
that tae her guidman that she marriet an’
swore tae honor an’ obey?”
It was then that Kate rallied to the
defence of her sex. “Aye,” she said impres-
sively, pouring herself a tot that made dilu-
tion a work of supererogation, “she has that
richt. What arre men? Wurrms an’ fules!
Think shame to yoursel’, Alexander Mac-
Phairson, boosin’ an’ canoodlin’ here in my
apairtment when your puir wife is sobbin’
oot her hairt on her pillow, thinkin’ over
SHE LIKED AN EPICURE.
MISS NEAR SIDE .: “So that’s the man who wanted to marry you!”
MISS FRIZZY HAIR : “Yes, dear, and I told him he hadn’t a hope. Still, you know,
darling, I do admire his taste.”
an’ over of the bonny days lang syne when
you and she were the worrld an’ a’ tae each
itlier. Dae ye no ken, ye dirrty dog, how a
wumman cherishes the memories of her
courtship? Dae ye nae ken hoo she’ll forgi’e
an’ forgi’e an’ forgi’e the mon she auce
lo’ed? She flared oot at ye and ca’ed ye
this an’ that, juist tae enjoy the makkin’
up agen. But what dae ye ken aboot a
wumman that ne’er had but one, an’ had
only one bicker wi’ her in eight years by
your ain account of it. AA T hat a mon to live
wi’! Mon did I say? Ma certes !” Pausing
for breath she poured herself another allo-
pathis slug.
Alick slipped an arm round her shapely
unclad shoulders. A resounding smack on
the cheek made him take it a.way agaiu.
“Tak’ your hands off me. Alexander Mac-
Phairson,” stormed the lady, “an’ gae back
tae your puir wife that’s greetin’ at hame,
sore o’ hairt. Gae back to her, an’”
“I wull, I wull!” gasped Alick, conscious-
stricken. “I’ll gae back an’ I’ll beg her for-
gi’eness on ma bendit knees for havin’ been
unfaitlifu’ tae her even in thocht —for it has
been nae mair, as ye ken, Kate McShane.
Ye liae opened my een, and I respect ye as a
noble an’ adorrrable wumman. Will ye no
gie me a wee bit kiss at pairtin’?”
Kate was nothing if not broad-minded.
They kissed. And Kate looked upon him
kindly and spoke more in sorrow than in
anger. "Alick,” she said, “ye’re a likeable
loon, but that’s nocht, for I’ve found most
men likeable —that’s ma weakness. But
ye’re a dom fule. Ye hae nae idea—nae
idea whatever —how to treat a wumman.
Gae ye back and beg forgi’eness on your
bendit knee an’ she’ll laugh at ye. Gang
in roarin’ like a lion an’ mak’ her beg yeir
parrdon for the wurrds she said an’ she’ll
respect and lo’e ye.”
“But,” stammered Alick. whose eyes were
beginning to bulge forth alarmingly, “I’m
in drink, an’ Jean’ll comb ma hair for that.
She’s got a terrible down on drink, has Jean.
An’ I canna quarrel wi’ her. I juist canna.
I lo’e her tac much.”
“AVeel, ye’d better mak a stairt wi’
quarrelin’,” said Kate uncompromisingly,
“or be a puir henpecked body a’ yeir life.
If I desairved it McShane used tae bash me
wi’ a leather belt till I couldna stir, but
I worrshippcd the verra ground lie walked
on. But he never raised hand agen me
unless I desairved it. He was a past mon,
an’ I wish, times —but that’s middling tae
dae wi’ you. Off wi’ ye, MacPhairson, an’
leave me to my maiden meditations.”
“Maid’n ,” started Alick. Then he
thought better of it. There was a look in
Kate’s eye. So he went.
:Jc :|c sjc *
The little house was wrapped in silence.
Alick had half-expected to find Jean waiting
up for him. But no. Not a light any-
where. His first instinct was to take off
his boots and creep in quietly, but Kate’s
advice had fired his Celtic soul. He was
relieved to find that he wasn’t quite as shot
as he ought to have been on the night’s
liquid record. Tli e
Yale key went home
at the third essay,
and lie found himself
in tin' liftlo hall. ,T ■
put his hat on the
rack very carefully
and went through to
the kitchen, where he
switched on the light.
There was a note pinned to the kitchen
dresser. Texts lie had learned in infancy
crowded on Alick’s mind. “Be sure your
sin will find you out” : “What ye sow, that
also shall ye reap” ; “The way of the trans-
gressor is hard”; “The wages of sin is
death.” But what was in the note? He
drew nearer, but Jean’s sprawling hand-
writing was just a blur. Was it to say she
had gone home to her mother, or run away
with the grocer’s man, or that she had cut
her throat with Alick’s safety-razor?
He tore the paper from its pin and held
it with both hands on the table —the letters
would merge and mingle and quiver. He
read:
Dear Alick,—There are two hard-boiled eggs in
the pantry under the little basin, and I have cut
you some bread and butter and corned beef.- —Jean.
She had written it in ink and something
wet had partially obliterated the words
“pantry” and “beef.”
Alick didn’t feel hungry, but it seemed
advisable to follow the kindly lead thus
given him. He went softly to the pantry,
the door of which was a quarter open, and
stepped inside. Something hit him on the
head with a resounding clang, and suddenly
he was deluged with cold water and gasping
for breath.
He backed into the kitchen, swearing
softly, and there in the doorway stood Jean,
smirking with derision.
“So you’re home, my drunken beauty,”
she said with false affability. "I thought
Id punish you and I haven’t finished with
yop yet. We’ll talk more of this the morn,
Alick, my man. I’ve made you up a bed
on the dining-room sofa, and you can just
go to it and sleep it off.” Then she was
gone, and he heard the key turn in the door
of her bedroom. And she had never looked
so pretty, lie thought regretfully.
The lump on the top of his head was
getting bigger and more painful every
minute, and liis clothes were drenched, lie
shivered. Nothing for it but to get them
off and go meekly to his appointed place.
Yes, the sofa was made up, with two
blankets and liis pyjamas laid out on the
pillow. And liis supper was on a little
table by the sofa. lie got his clothes off
and dried himself in the bathroom. Then
lie put on his pyjamas and sat down on the
sofa, pondering. Women were too damned
clever, lie reflected muzzily. No chance to
act on Kate McShane’s advice.
His eye fell on a tack-hammer that lay
on the mantelpiece between one of the ch.ua
dogs and the marble clock. It was half-past
one, so the clock said with a silvery ping.
He looked at the tack-liammer as Lady
Macbeth may have eyed the dagger. It
had a long claw, and it might be used as a
lever. And Jean had never looked so pretty.
His jaw set. lie put his right hand to the
hammer like Jael in the Scriptures, and
strode down the hall. The bedroom door
always had been a loosely-fitting affair and
one wrench pulled the screws from the hasp.
He stepped firmly into the room and
switched on the light.
Jean lay perfectly still, her nose red, her
pillow dank with tears. He almost melted,
but remembering in time that he was a
lion, he roared “Jean, wake up!”
A very small voice, shaken with sobs,
answered “What’s the matter, Alick; is the
house on fire?”
“No,” he said sternly. “I’m coming to
bed, that’s all. I don’t like that damned
sofa and I don’t like your funny tricks.”
The vernacular into which he had lapsed
under the magic influence of J. Walker and
the eyes of Kate McShane had vanished,
and lie spoke Australian. “Get up!” he
thundered.
“Why?'’ asked Jean, (startled.
“I think you’ve gone mad with
drink. That’s the matter with
you!”
“Perhaps I am drunk,” sail
Alick severely, “and perhaps I am
not. But you get up!”
She got up out of bed and con-
fronted him bravely enough. Only
five foot two was Jean, with eyes
of blue, and Alick’s heart skipped
a beat. She was sonsy—l insist that
she was sonsy. But men must work and
women must weep and the sooner it’s
over the sooner to sleep. Alick pulled his
spouse roughly towards him, laid her over
liis knee and gave her six hearty spanks.
“Now,” he asked firmly, “have I got a
silly fat face, and are you sick of seeing
it?”
No answer save sobs. Six more spanks.
Then —“I didn’t mean that Alick, really
I didn’t. But you are so annoying some-
times. You knew I wan ted to gp to the
pictures and you never thought of asking
me if I’d like to go. I’ve been a goo-goo-
goo-hood wife to you, Al-alick, and you
never have the sli-sli-slightest thought' for
me. I hate you.”
Six more spanks. “Do you hate .me?”
asked Alick ominously.
“No!” exclaimed Jean explosively, strug-
gling to her feet. “Come to bed like a good
lad. I love you, and well you know it, you
great big fool!” And then, a little later:
“I put the big glass jug in the ice-chest
for the morning, Alick. I thought you’d
need it. Now don’t say you haven’t got a
good little wife.”
“I have— now,” muttered Alick drowsily.
CHARLES BLAKE.
“Natar”: The New Guinea native makes
use of some strange varieties of binding
oaths. In one place, on the mainland coast
of the Mandated Territory, the object upon
which such oaths are taken is a small piece
of carved stick, used for no other purpose.
It is said to have been in the possession of
the village for unrem'embered ages, and
extraordinary reverential value is attached
to it. In another village the native swears
upon a fragment of dried-up human flesh,
while in a third place, near the Dutch
border, the skull of a child is used for the
purpose. When such a pledge is taken it is
usually gone through with scrupulous fidelity.

Gan a settler recover half cost of mainten-

—2449.
The settler may by notice in writing,
require his neighbor to assist in equal pro-
portions in repairing the dividing fence. If
the neighbor refuses or neglects to assist,
then, after the lapse of six months from
tlic date of service, if no reasonable excuse
is given, the settler may carry out the job
himself and may recover half the incurred
expenditure from the neighbor as money
laid out for his benefit.
Can you (jive me particulars of the s.s.
Waratah and its sinking? —26B3.
The Waratah was a 9000-ton twin-screw
steamer of Lund’s Blue Anchor Line, She
left Adelaide for London July 7, 1909, coaled
at Durban and sailed for Capetown on July
26. She was sighted the next day by s.s.
Clan Maclntyre. It is reasonably certain
that the Waratah capsized in a heavy westerly
gale on July 28, when off the South African
coast; 211 lives were lost, including 92
passengers.
My horse teas stalled in the joint of the
fetlock. A splinter was extracted hut de-
spite all manner of treatment over the
past six months the animal can scarcely walk.
Can anything he done? —2513.
The horse is apparently suffering from
septic arthritis. A chronic condition has
set up and it is doubtful whether any
treatment will now avail. If the animal can-
not be used for stud purposes, it should be
destroyed.
Has coffee been grown successfully in Aus-
tralia ?- —2448.
In Queensland the area under crop reached
547 acres in 1901-02. In 1925-26 it was

Can freehold property with water frontage
he purchased in Victoria? —2332.
Crown lands in Vic. were once sold to
the water’s edge. Since 1871 water front-
ages to the sea and streams have been per-
manently reserved, and no freehold titles
may be acquired for the frontage except
with the authority of Parliament.
Is there a mono-rail line in Ireland? What
style is it? What is the principle of the
Brennan mono-rail? —2522.
Yes ; between Ballybunnion and Listowel.
It is a Lartigue system, the train being
straddled over a central elevated rail. Louis
Brennan’s cars run on a single rail laid on
the ground, stability being maintained by a
heavy gyrostat revolving at great speed in a
vacuum.
I want a job as a stewardess on a deep-
sea vessel. (1) Where and how should I
apply? (2) Must I join a union? (3)

ney, in person. (2) Yes, but not until a
position has been obtained. (3) Nine hours
per day within a spread of 15 hours.
How to treat dirt tennis-court with oil? —

feet.
(1) What is the cause of heavy coating
of the tongue? (2) What are the early
symptoms of cancer of the tongue, and is
there any cure without operation? —242o.
(1) Heavy coating of the tongue can
be caused by many" things. Probably the
commonest is constipation. (2) The first
symptom of cancer of the tongue is generally
the appearance of a warty out-growth or
ulcer in the front two-thirds of the tongue.
When the ulcer has progressed a little it
has hard rolled-over edges, a ragged, foul
floor and bleeds easily. Only a properly
qualified medical man can distinguish be-
tween a cancer ulcer and the various other
kinds met with in the tongue. There is no
cure without operation. As cancer of the
tongue is one form of the disease where a
cure is certain if taken early, it is a matter
of life and death that not a minute be lost
in seeking a competent surgeon.
When was the first submarine cable con-
nected betiveen Australia and England, and
what was the route? (2) When was the
Pacific cable opened for traffic? —2sl4.
November, 1871. The cable ended at
Port Darwin and ran through Banjoewangie,
Batavia and Singapore, and then via Bom-
bay and Madras to London. The S.A.
Government constructed an overland line
from Port Darwin to Port Augusta, 1971
miles, completed August 22, 1872. (2)

(1) Is it possible to get an injurious
shock off a 12-16 volt accumulator? (2)
Which is correct —accumulator or storage
battery? (3) Is the ivork of the battery
to convert low-tension current into high-
current for use at the spark-plug? (4)
Would it be possible to obtain a greater
shock from the accumulator than from the
spark-plug? (5) If the voltage is increased
by the battery, ivhat is it at the spark-plug?
2524.
(1) No. (2) Secondary battery is the
term. (3) Yes. through an induction or
spark-coil. (4) From the spark-plug. (5)
Voltage increases roughly by ratio of
primary turns to secondary turns on induc-
tion-coil, i.e., 10-volts battery 10 turns on
primary; 100 turns on secondary, approxi-
mately, 100 volts at secondary terminals.
What is a cure for tender hands? —2637.
Hands easily affected by traumatic derma-
titis sometimes defy all care. You must be
very particular to avoid strong soaps and
strong winds. Where healing is obstinate
keep hands out of water and soap altogether
and cleanse with olive-oil. Removal of the
cause of irritation is practically the only
remedy.
How can I become a teacher of carpentry
at a technical college in N.S.W.? Is prefer-
ence given to ex-pupils of a technical college?
—2379.
You do not state whether you wish to
qualify for appointment as a full-time or
part-time teacher. If you have served an
apprenticeship and are still working at the
carpentry trade, you would be eligible for
appointment. If you have had teaching
experience or have been through the
carpentry classes these would be added
qualifications. Appointments are made by
the Public Service Board, which in the first
place advertises vacancies.
Hoic long would it take me to become an
optometrist, and what would it cost? —2507.
N.S.W. Institute of Optometrists, 74 Pitt-
street, Sydney, Conducts classes which start
in'january next. The full course takes three
years and costs £7B 15s.
Is an upper plate of false teeth detrimental
to the singing voice? Does it make it impos-
sible to impart “color” to the singing“? Does
the material in the plate make any differ-
ence? Does any professional singer of note
wear false teeth?— 247o.
Many professional singers have false teeth.
“Color” is due to mental and emotional
rather than physical influences. The effect
is not detrimental so long as the plate is of
gold or silver. Iloland Foster, of the N.S.W.
iConservatorium, informs us that the vocal
expert of Melbourne Conservatorium has
perfected a method of attaching false teeth
without using a plate, thus overcoming any
actual or imaginary interference. Dr. I bai-
ley Ham, of Collins-street, Melbourne, conld
supply information on this point.
Is there any reliable information concern-
ing the Hindu or Egyptian “rope trick” in
which a fakir, working in the open, throws
a rope into the air where it remains sus-
pended while a small boy climbs to the top
and disappears —2s2o.
Maskciyne, the famous conjurer, spent
much time and money in the East in a vain
attempt to track down the rope trick, or any
person who had ever seen it.
Is it permissible for owners of motor-
cars and motor-cycles to sound. ' their hooters'
without reason? May a motor-cycle be
driven along the footpath?— -2441.
The N.S.W. Motor Traffic Act provides
penalty for “any unnecessary noise made
with the horn or alarm attached to any
motor vehicle,” and forbids persons driving
motor vehicles along footpaths.
Did Marcus Clarke, author of “For the
Term of His Natural Life,” write a play that
teas prohibited by the police? What teas
its title', why was it prohibited and when?
—2551.
,“The Happy Land.” It was a satire on
the Graham Berry Government in Yic, and
was played twice during January, 1880.
The play, was further prohibited and printed,
and printed copies were seized and destroyed
by? .the police. As Marcus Clarke was a
civil servant, it was written under the name
of TI. E. Walton, a friend and actor who
took the leading part in another version,
which was played soon after Clarke’s was
prohibited.
To prevent sun-burn, or to minimise
its effects after sea-bathing? —2s64.
Apply calamine lotion before or carron-
oil after bathing.
(1) In ichat manner arc members of the
Upper Houses of the various Australian
states appointed? (2) How many politicians
are- there in Australia, and how are they

What arc the initial symptoms of T.BJ
—2013. . ,
Tuberculosis may attack any organ in the
body and may produce widely different symp-
toms. T.B. of the brain, for example, is quite
different from the same disease of the blad-
der. Presumably you refer to tuberculosis
of the lungs; in this the initial symptoms
are loss of weight and energy, a cough vary-
ing according to the advance of the disease,
night sweats and coughing up of blood.

Certain methods in the motoring world
have earned unquestioned acceptance as best
■ —by both British and American engineers
and by truck owners in general. Methods
embodied in such units as Timken Tapered
Roller Bearings, Floating Rear Axles, Over-
head Valves, Cast-iron Pistons , Full Pressure-
feed Lubrication Equipment, Spicer Universal
Joints, etc. Why be content, then, with some
parts in your truck admittedly not as good as
these? It means better service to have them
all —and the Brockway 35cwt. “Highway
Express” embodies them ail!
It has an overhead valve Wisconsin truck
motor developing 50h.p. at only 2100 r.p.m.
—lubricated by full pressure-feed to gudgeons
through drilled crankshaft. (Even the valve
mechanism has forced lubrication, through
hollow rocker shaft.) Its accessible Brown
Lipe gear-box has Timken tapered roller bear-
ings—easily adjusted. A two-piece propeller
shaft, with three Spicer universals, eliminates
“whipping.” The full-floating rear axle, on
Timken bearings, has an axle shaft which
takes none of the truck’s weight. Final drive
is by spiral bevel gear. And the chassis has
five cross members, preventing all twist
through road camber and all warping strain
on the body. Standard equipment includes
power tyre pump, five 32x6 cord tyres, Leece
Neville self-starter, generator, etc.
The “Highway Express” averages 15
miles per gallon of petrol—less than half a
pint of oil per 1 000 miles. Apply at the near-
est address below for full particulars and
demonstrations.

30 TONS IN ONE HAUL—an actual incident.
Back wheels sunk almost to differential in soft earth, front axle resting on
ground, front wheels locked against direction of return to road and on a 1 -in-4
grade between Leura and Katoomba (Blue Mountains, N.S.W.) this 5-ton lorry,
with its load, defied the efforts of another heavy lorry to move it—could not
be hauled out even by this lorry and a steam roller combined. Finally, W. Wright s
Brockway 4-tonner, carrying 1\ tons, was tried.
In reverse, at the lowest of its nine speeds, it lifted out the stranded truck witn
ease —ploughing a foot-deep furrow, 20ft. long, with the latter s near side locked
front wheel. Regular drivers on the spot estimated the total haul at 30 tons. (Wit-
nesses confirm the report. This Brockway is recognised as the most powerful truck
on the Mountain route. In the first nine months it covered 30,000 miles under
consistent overloads, at a total cost of only 15/6 for repairs and replacements
excluding tyres. —F.P.L,.)

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
J. M. C. Forsayth, who owned the erratic
Royal Roue and backed him for a fortune
in Ballymena’s A.J.C. Derby, threw in for
a big win on Yiolian in a division of the
Trial Stakes at Canterbury Park on Satur-
day. It was so long since Violian had raced
-—he is an unsexed son of Violoncello and
showed capital form as a two-year-old early
last season —that some of the bookmakers
were caught napping, 20 to 1 being laid in
places, though it was fours at the close of
operations. And then the good thing came
undone, for Violian was beaten a head by
Genuine (3 to 1). a three-year-old brother
to Lady Valais; Portlight (7 to 1), the third
horse, was lengths away. A race in public
or another gallop or two would have done the
business for Violian, who will now be well
looked after by both handicappers and book-
makers —worse luck for Forsayth.
M. Poison, who trains for A. J. Matthews,
the bookmaker-owner of Fuji San, essayed
to win both divisions of the Flying Handicap
with mares racing in his own colors. Lilah
(3 to 1) failed him in the first division,
being beaten into third place by the Maori-
land-bred Jazz Baby (9 to 2) and Padicol
(7 to 1) ; but Lady Buckinbar (7 to 1) had
things all her own way in the second divi-
sion once she caught Greenie (9 to 4), who
is a stopper if there ever was one. Lady
Buckinbar was ridden by little Pike, whose
big brother Jimmy rides Fuji San and Pre-
posterer for the Matthews-Poison combina-
tion ; she should win again presently—at the
Christmas meeting, perhaps. These sprints
were run in pouring rain, which did not cease
for the rest of the day.
The Canterbury Handicap, to which £5OO
Avas added, Avas a good betting race, there
being money for Prime Don, Fondant (each
4 to 1), Lovebox (7 to 1), Wedding Eve,
Night Heron, Spaghetti (each 8 to 1), Obey
and Valamita (each 10 to 1). Night Heron
and Prime Don had the finish to themselves,
Teddy Keys’s horse, who improved consider-
ably on his effort at Warwick Farm, dispos-
ing of the three-year-old by a long head. Fon-
dant was three lengths away, with Wedding
Eve and Valamita next. Prime Don was
knocked back at the seven-furlong post, and
his supporters swear that the interference
cost him the race, but racehorses are peculiar
animals and this is by no means certain.
The track was in such a state that it took
Night Heron 2min. to run the 11
furlongs. He is a useful customer, particu-
larly when the going is heavy, and is a Sum-
mer Cup possibility with 7st. 101 b.
McCarten, who had ridden Jazz Baby, got
a race out of Royal Sun (4 to 1) in the
Welter. On a previous occasion at Canter-
bury Park the M.L. jockey was blamed for
the defeat of Sunstar’s son, but lie made no
mistake this time. Rosso, the favorite, was
apparently bothered by the going, and Min-
jerookah failed badly.

A PLUS MAN.
SNARLE: “What’s your golf handicap?”
SNORLE: “Thish!”
Quite the feature of the afternoon’s racing
at Mentone (Vic.) on Saturday was Waran-
ton’s success in the Plate. The old gelding
had looked a little unlucky to be beaten by
Donace at the Valley the previous Saturday,
and despite his load of lOst. 121 b. the public
sent him out favorite at 9 to 4; Translator,
who had lOst. 51b., was next in request at
3 to 1. Getting none the best of a bad
start, Waranton didn’t appear on the scene
until’half-way ur» the straight, where Trans-
lator looked a likely winner. However, the
favorite came fast, caught the Linacre geld-
ing near the distance, and beat him by nearly
a length, Serotina, a 20-to-l shot, being a
good third. Waranton’s last four starts have
produced two wins and two close seconds.
He is a sterling sprinter, and Translator is
also speedy and game, though not quite in
the same class.
There were only six starters for the Men-
tone Handicap, but the presence of Textile
added some distinction to the affair. The
Caulfield Cup winner, who was making his
reappearance after a brief —very brief —spell,
was favorite at threes, Horoscope being at
7 to 2, Smoke Bomb and David Garrick at
fours and Chickling at fives—McShortodds
was determined to be on the safe side. Textile
was leading at the distance, but in a great
finish Horoscope just snatched the decision
from him by a head, David Garrick being
three parts of a length further back third.
As at Sandown, Horoscope was ridden by
Harold Jones, as also Avas Waranton.
Backers, who had been doing fairly well, got
a nasty jolt when The Cretan (20 to 1)
landed the Purse from Quandary (15 to 1)
and Garina Younger (S to 1). The Cretan
is oAvned and trained by old-time jockey
Chris Moore.
Hs * H-
“Tuart” : Betting on the pursuit of the tin
hare is, or is to be, prohibited in every
State except N. S. Wales. In the Ma State
an obliging Labor Government authorised
“investors” (as it called them) to establish
the disease in Sydney and Newcastle, al-
though Parliament had objected. The new
Government, on going into the matter, found
two tin-hare companies racing four nights
a veeek in Sydney, and another lot of “inves-
tors” preparing to introduce night trotting.
It was also advised, as its Chief Sec. said,
that “within a 40-mile radius of Sydney
there are now held annually 64 horse-racing
meetings, 72 pony-racing meetings and 00
trotting meetings, making a total of 196.”
The Government would have averted a lot of
trouble by declaring tin-hare betting unlaw-
ful, as has been done in Westralia and Vic.:
instead, it has contented itself with making
betting after sunset unlawful. This, of
course, will render further legislation neces-
sary. In the meantime the tin hare will
clash with the horses and the ponies. My
only hope is that the competition with the
pony meetings will settle both.
* * * *
“Tedrieh”: E. Davidson, a Cowra
(N.S.W.) jockey, rode nine firsts and one
second in a programme of 10 races at Gul-
gong recently. Most of the winners were
from the stable of W. H. Kurtz, a Mudgee
trainer.
* * * *
“Roodee”: In riding 164 winners during
the English flat-racing season (B. l/12/’27),
Gordon Richards broke the post-war record
of 143, put up by Steve Donoghue in 1920.
This is Richards’s second season on top;
though he had to drop out through illness, ho
headed the list with 118 winning mounts last
year, stopping Donoghue’s trot of four suc-
cessive seasons. But neither jockey will
ever approach Fred Archer’s best achieve-
ment—246 winners in 1885. Competition
is much keener than it was in the days
of “The Tinman.”
* * * H!
“Two Seas”: Whatever may be said in
favor of the jockey crouching over his
mount’s withers in a flat race (B. 8/12/’27),
there is little doubt that in riding over the
sticks such an attitude generally leads to
disaster if the horse raps the fence. The
jockey is of no earthly use to his mount in
that case. Yet one frequently hears the
idiotic remark, from those who were never
on a horse, “The jockey fairly lifted his
mount over the last hurdle.” They ought
to try lifting themselves over a sheet of
paper by their long ears. When this scribe
learned to ride he was taught to throw his
weight forward as his mount took off at
a jump, and lean backwards as it topped
the fence and landed. We wore our leathers
just long enough to enable us to clear the
pommel when standing up in the stirrups.
We controlled the horse. The monkey on
the withers can’t. Let those who think
differently try the Tod Sloan seat on a buck-
jumper.
# * # #
“Ike Mcßagg” : One of the handicaps im-
posed on bookmakers who have not had the
benefit of a classical education is the bestowal
of unusual names upon racehorses. I can
remember when the Tommies had to tackle
monikers like L’Abbesse de la Jouarre
and Euphrosyne. Modern taste is rather in
the direction of simplicity, but the Aga
Khan is reviving the old tongue-twisters;
he races prads bearing the names of Blan-
chailles, Mahableshwar, Prince Firouze and
Aryavardha. Fancy having to yelp those
out with the money coming all ways and
prices shifting accordingly! Betting “in
running” would be out of the question—in
six-furlong flutters, at all events. A cove
wouldn’t be able to get some of ’em out in
the time between the barrier going up and
the judge placing the wrong horse first.
* ❖ *
“Bourse”: Among the many outside
agencies which are impinging on the book-
maker’s rights is a French system permitting
a punter to insure himself against loss when
backing jumpers. If the monkey leaves the
saddle and remains unglued, you get back
the amount of your stake, less 10 per cent,
for insurance. If he mounts again, you get
the whole of the stake back. If the nag
wins or gets a place you collect the div.
* * * *
“Amateur Urger” : The nag which emerges
from between the shafts of a butcher’s cart
to win good races is not unknown in racing
legend, and the good performer that pro-
gresses backwards to the shafts of a hansom-
cab has also been heard of—though what
the poor brute does for his chaff in these
days of motor-cars deponent knoweth not.
But a Derby winner which has been con-
verted to hurdle-racing purposes is some-
thing new, as far as the writer is concerned.
This has been the lot of Oomir, winner of
the Tasmanian Derby last December. The
other day. the once Rolls Royce prad started
in the Hurdles at Sundown Park (Vic.)
and finished in the Ford class. Sic transit
gloria “neddy,” as the classics have it.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Though Lacliie McDonald, of Maoriland,
got the verdict on points in his 15-round go
with Bruno Frattini, of Italy, at Sydney
Stadium on Monday night, the descendant of
the Caesars was not disgraced. The Maori-
lander was 6-|lb. lighter than Bruno, whose
weight was given as list. 10^lb. (he could
have shed a few pounds with advantage),
and used a snappy left to some purpose in
the earlier part of the light. Frattini, on
the other hand, had all the better of the
last few rounds; McDonald was nearly out
in the 14tli. The newcomer made a good
impression, and with improved condition
should bother our middleweights.

for the world’s heavyweight championship,
got another daddy of a belting last
from Johnny Risko at Cleveland, U.S. Scott
was a punching block for Risko till the
seventh round, when he sank to the floor and
demanded a verdict on a foul. The referee
couldn’t see it. Scott says he is returning
to America to figure in the elimination bouts
again next year. It seems hardly worth
while.

DEAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Don’t touch the favorite,” ’e said.
“It’s dead!”
Of course, I’m not the sort that falls
For any o’ these flamin’ stalls
About this ’orse and that; but Joe,
’E's different. ’E oughter know.
Y’ see, ’e’s trackin’ with a jane
That knows a bint that Nipper Bain
Is squarin’ up to. So I goes
And puts me roll on old Bluenose,
And waits about to grab the dough.
I know Astliore could win, but Joe,
’E said,
“Don’t touch the favorite. It’s dead!”
“ ’Ot case the favorite,” ’e said.
“It’s dead !”
So back I goes and ’ as some more
Of Bluenose. Nipper’s on Asthore;
And, stone the crows, the ’orse ain’t bred
That could get ’ome (not with ’is ’ead)
When Nipper takes a reef on ’im.
And Bluenose —why, old Blue could swim
Against the rest, against the tide,
And still be easy ’ome and dried.
It seems a shame to take the dough,
With Nipper in the gun—and Joe,
’E said,
“ ’Ot case the favorite. It’s dead !”
“Just watch the favorite,” ’e said.
“It’s dead!”
And, struth ! And ain’t I watcliin’ it,
Out on its OAvn and on the bit;
And still and all, it don’t look like
That Nipper’s pullin’ much. Ah, strike!
A man just oughter go to bed
And nurse ’isself; to think ’e shed
’ls milk-teeth on a flamin’ course,
And learnt ’is letters from an ’orse,
And still can go and do ’is dough
On any tabby’s yarn ; but Joe,
’E said,.
“Just watch the favorite. It’s dead!”
“Don’t touch the favorite,” ’e said.
“It’s dead!”
“I didn’t touch it—no !” I squealed ;
“And neither will the flamin’ field.”
Just mucked it out, and come ’ome strong,
With Nipper soolin’ it along,
’Bout ’alf the straight ahead of Blue.
And Joe, ’e said, “Why, blime.... Sue,
She must ’ve got the tale all crook.”
“Too true,” I said, “but this ain’t—-look!”
And when they rushed to pick up Joe
(Of course, that don’t get back me dough)
I said,
“Don’t touch the silly coot. “E’s dead!”
“ ’Ere’s ’opin’, anyway,” I said,
“ ’E’s dead !”
victoria.

That active and elusive atom Teddy Green
(Bst. lib.) met Archie Cowan (Sst. 61b.) at
the Leichhardt Stadium on Friday night,
and won an unquestionably correct award
at the end of the 12 rounds scheduled. The
cousin of Jack Green — avlio gained the
featherweight and lightweight titles before
cruel over-use of his youthful energies put
the extinguisher on Avhat should have been
a great career—gets more slippery every
time he boxes, and the speed of his short
legs and evasive head had the dangerous
Cowan quite bemused at times.

“B.M.’s” hail and farewell: —
Albert Griffiths (“Griffo”), the most brilliant
boxer of all time, died in New York last week
penniless and friendless. He was about 55 years of
age. He first came into notice as a small and dirty
preliminary boy at Larry Foley’s White Horse Hotel
hall, George-street, Sydney, where Camden Chambers
now stand. He then sold papers in the streets, and
lived in a humble dwelling on the Rocks. All
newsboys haA'e to fight, and in his little affairs
“Griffo,” as his mates called him, had shown excep-
tional ability. Hence his modest appearance at
Foley’s, late in 1887.
He boxed in the hob-nailed bluchers he wore at
his Avork. 1 remember how the habitues of Foley’s
used to laugh as he clumped about the ring so
hobbled. Hut they soon began to appreciate the
fact that the puny and silent kid was something
out of the -common.
Early in 1888 “Griffo” had begun a boxing
career that was to carry him to world-Wide fame.
His two battles at Foley’s with Abe Willis were
epics. He Avon the first on points and, hearing that
Willis was dissatisfied with the verdict, gave that
very clever bantam another chance. On the second
occasion he cut Abe to pieces and knocked him out in
the fifth round.
Thj lease of the White Horse was falling in, and
the Sydney Amateur Gymnastic Club was formed,
with quarters in the old Masonic Hall, York-street.
There “Griffo” fought for purses which steadily
grew fatter. He was still a quiet, unassuming boy
when that wonderful Aucklander Billy Murphy came
back from America bearing the Richard K. Fox gold
champion belt, won, after a desperate 10 rounds, at
San Francisco, from Ike Weir, till then holder of
the world’s featherweight title. Murphy, welcoiped
at the S.A.G.C., expressed regret that there was no
fitting opponent in Australia to meet him for the
championship. “Griffo” —a clean and neatly dressed
“Griffo” now —climbed through the ropes. “Genel-
men,” he said, “I’ll fight Mistah Mairphy.”
The club put up a purse of £350 ( £5O to the
loser). It Avas a thrilling fight for 16 rounds; then
Murphy turned it up, saying his hands were useless.
They met again about a year later, at the same
place. Again “Griffo” was victorious.
Up to this period Albert had been temperate and
modest, but flattery went to his head. He took to
drink and high life and became incorrigible. On
one occasion he promised Captain Morse that he
would go to San Francisco by the mail steamer
Alameda, and was given a valuable outfit so that he
might appear a credit to himself, his sponsor and
the country. He was actually aboard, and the
Alameda had started to leave Woolloomooloo Bay,
when “Griffo” took a header, swam to the Avharf
and was hauled ashore. He became the leader of a
push, and would beat the streets at the head of his
gang getting booze in public-houses, under duress,
and bailing up erstAvhile admirers and backers. “I
can’t ’old de push if yous don’t fork out de splosh
fer a few boozes,” he would say, and the threat Avas
invariably effective. He even thus blackmailed men
who had practically picked him out of the gutter.
Then, to the general relief, Ted Alexander, a
young Sydney JeAV domiciled in San Francisco, came
from that city Avith the money for “Griffo’s”
passage and a list of prospective fights. And to
the general surprise the “fedder” signed up and
accompanied Ted to California. He had a couple
of fights under Alexander’s management, made a
big sensation and a lot of dollars, then threw his
benefactor over. In later years he fought and beat
the greatest in the land, but ruffians robbed him of
decisions and dollars. Drink got such a hold on
him that he Avas done Avith as a fighter in the early
thirties, but - long after he became a mere deadbeat
he was pointed out to visitors and “Avritten up” by
authorities like Jim Corbett as the master of
Lavigne (conqueror of Walcott), McAuliffe, Dixon
and Gans —and the cleverest boxer that ever climbed
through the ropes. And he was fated to die in a
New York dosshouse !
The Ins and Outs
With the luck of the game against them,
the South Australians went down heavily in
their first Sheffield Shield match of the
season. They made only 177 and 159
against Victoria’s total of 646 for eight
Aviekets. Harris (61) batted Avell in South’s
second knock, but Blackie (4 for 45) and
Morton (3 for 47) proved too much for the
side on the damaged wicket.
* * * *
“Kir” : Bert Ironmonger, who did so well
with the ball for Vic. v. South Aus., learned
his cricket with milkeans as wickets, pieces
of pine as bats and withered oranges
gathered from his father’s orchard as balls.
He was born at Pine Mountain, which is
about 50 miles from Brisbane, and the
artistic manner in which he used to bam-
boozle the boys of the village with his breaks
moved Pine Mountain to prophesy that he
would be in the Australian eleA’en some day.
The prediction was never fulfilled, but left-
handers distinctly inferior to Ironmonger,
now a veteran, have played in Test matches.
* * * *
“C.L.D.”: Patsy Hendren, now coaching
young cricketers in S. Aus., saAV a lad at St.
Peter’s College shaping like a tradesman.
“Strange how he reminds me of Clem Hill,”
said the Middlesex man. “Why, lie’s got
many of Clem’s strokes.” It happened to
be a son of Clem's eldest sister. Clem, it
will be remembered Avas discovered at Prince
Alfred College by Joe Darling and George
Giffen, and it was through George’s per-
sistent advocacy that the youngster secured
his first trip to England. Adelaide Soccer
people, by the way, want to keep Hendren
in South Aus. as a coach, and are pre-
pared to make him a big offer. But the
international is obliged to return to Eng-
land and play for Middlesex; his agreement
with the S.A.C.A. is limited to this season.
* * * *
“Bumpkin”: lan Lee, of the South
Melbourne team, is surely the • youngest
cricketer ever to play in a district first
eleven. He is 13. In the match against
Carlton he made a splendid catch at square-
leg. The crowd roared and the bowler
kissed him.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: It has early become
evident that the extended Sheffield Shield
contest will tend to Weaken touring teams
because of the inability of some of the
cracks to spare the time. The Queensland
team going south will be minus Hornibrook
and Ron Oxenliam; L. E. Qxenham and L.
Lister, a Townsville batsman of high repute,
will fill the places. N.S.W. will field
THE WAY OF IT.
RRINGSLDER: “Did the other bloke knock ’im?”
DISGUSTED SECOND: “Nah! ’E ’ad sich a good smother ’e nearly suffocated ’imself.”
Andrews, but Gregory cannot visit Mel-
bourne and Adelaide. O’Reilly has been
dropped, and Bradman and Scanes come
into the team. Why young Nicholls, the
Cumberland fast bowler, has not been given
a chance it is hard to understand. South
Australia, for its part, has dropped Hal-
combe in favor of Scott, formerly of Mar-
rickville.
* * * * «
“Bramall Lane”: After all the shouting
and the tumult, Herbert Sutcliffe is not to
be captain of the Yorkshire County team. He
cabled his withdrawal from South Africa,
where he is playing with the M.C.C. team, and
the job has been taken on by an amateur,
Captain Worsley, who has played for the
M.C.C., the Army and the Gentlemen, as
Avell as the county. There is much talk of
snobbery, but, reading between the lynes,
it looks as if Sutcliffe’s resignation was really
due to the feeling aroused among his brother
professionals in the Yorkshire XI. Most
of the crack amateurs of to-day Avelcoim-d
the appointment; it was left to Rhodes, Kil-
ner, Dolphin and others to make nasty
remarks and demand reasons why their own
claims were not considered.
Racquet and Bawl
The first series of Davis Cup trials In
Sydney were spoilt by the rain. In what
play Avas possible during three days the out-
standing event was the defeat of Victoria’s
lan Mclnnes by R. O. Cummings. Both
showed fine form in the recent Victorian
championships; Cummings’s consistency
brought him home on this occasion. E. T.
Rowe, the South Australian, scored a point
by beating Jim Willard in three consecu-
tive sets, after losing the first two.
* * * *
“Hotham”: Mrs. O’Hara Wood (Vic.)
and Louie Bicker ton (N.S.W.) are to accom-
pany Esna Boyd and Daphne Akliurst on the
S’African and European tour. The team will
leave Fremantle on March 12, and will
spend a month in South Africa. Then will
come the French championships (May 21 to
June 3) and Wimbledon, which begins on
June 25; the ladies will probably play in
mixed doubles with members of the Austra-
lian Davis Cup team at Wimbledon.
* * * *
“Bumpkin”: The impression I carried
away from Ivooyong is that Crawford is
easily the most promising of the colts. On
a Avet court, badly ploughed, and with sodden
balls, Patterson beat him in the Vic. singles
championship, but these are conditions in
which experience counts. Moreover, Gerald
can still work out the longest game of
strategy of any man in the Australian field.
But Crawford is undoubtedly a coming man.
He has the right temperament for the game.
He tends to run too much around the ball
to get it on his forehand, but his driving is
assured and his footwork fine. As regards
doubles, however, the tournament revealed
no born combinations such as Brookes and
Wilding provided.
* * * $
“Cut Shot” : The French L.T.F.’s annual
ranking list is of particular interest at this
juncture, as showing the estimation in which
their own countrymen hold the players who
will be with us in January. Lacoste is in
the place of honor; then come Cochet,
Borotra, Brugnon, Landry, Boussus and
George.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: The English L.T.A. is
after the scalp of the “player-writer,” so
called. Its objection is not So much to the
actual writing as to the fact that most ten-
nis stars who indulge in the lucrative prac-
tice simply hire out their names to the news-
papers employing them. The association
holds that this is “contrary to the ethics of
amateur sport,” which may be true. But
isn’t it for the organised journalists to take
action, in Australia as well as Britain,
rather than the tennis associations?
* * * *
“Top Spin” : The American tennis authori-
ties, possibly Avith a gloomy idea that they
may not otherwise see them, have invited
the Australian Davis Cup players to visit
U.S.A. on their way back to the Common-
wealth. The women’s team is also invited,
and if the Australian authorities can screw
up their courage the addition to the tour
will be all the better for the players and
tennis generally.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Toolburra”: Several queer crow and golf-
ball stories have appeared in The Bulletin,
but the golfers of Warwick (Q.) are pre-
pared to swear to this one—on a stack of
Bibles, if need be. A local player drove a
“screamer” at the “cultivation” hole. As
he approached the lie—the golf ball’s, of
course—a crow swooped down on the nice
new pill and carried it off. The ball was of
the variety known as “Kroflite.” Yet there
are some people who will tell you there’s
nothing in a name.
* * * *
Tommy Howard and W. Corry beat
Walter Clark and V. James in their match
for £5O a-side on the Royal Sydney Club’s
links. The game occupied two days, 36
holes being played on each. At the end of
the first day Clark and James were 3 up;
Howard had been off his game, and the lead-
ing pair had played good, steady golf. On
the Saturday Howard found himself; he
had the opposition’s lead cut out at the
fifth, and forged ahead at the eighth. But
Corry was less consistent than on Friday,
and Clark and James, hanging doggedly on,
were soon on level terms. The play see-
sawed right up to the final hole, Howard
and Corry halving on the 72nd and winning
on the post, on e up. Sinclair and Sou tar
have challenged the winners.
* * * *
In the tussle for the Manly Summer Cup
Eric Apperlsy showed a return to his old-
time form by returning a card of 74 for the
IS holes —four up on the stiff Manly bogey
of 7S, and a record for the course. The same
club’s summer handicap was taken by G. 11.
Wyld, with a stroke score of 83. His handi-
cap was 10, and he won with 73, L. C.
Emanuel (18) being second with a net score
of 74 and a stroke total of 92.
* * * *
“Brassey”: Adelaide is putting on “dog”
about its municipal golf-links, which visitors
have described as the best in Australia —one
enthusiast proclaimed them “the finest muni-
cipal links in the world.” Much salt may
be taken with statements made after the
return to the nineteenth, and the consequent
feeling of being at peace with the world, but
the course deserves its high reputation. In
addition to all the usual modern aids to
good golf, the fairways at the approaches
to the greens have been planted with couch
grass, and are kept in a perpetually clean-
shaved state by a mower pulled by a motor
tractor.
* * * *
“Hoot, Mon”: Night golf (B. S/12/’27)
is years older than Arnaud Massey’s essay
at the Forest of Marly. Golf is played at
night on a full course at Briarcliffe
(TT.S.A.), fairways and greens being electric-
ally lit. In 1914 a match Avas played at
Bushey Park, England, at midnight, with
no illumination save a number of motor
headlights. The match was a four-baller;
the players were W. G. Astor and Edward
Ray against S. Froy and J. Batley. Then
there is the classic instance of the two Scots
who started to play a match at night with
balls coated with luminous paint. The argu-
ment that ensued when one of them tried to
sink a glowworm on the ninth green caused
the match to be abandoned. The rules com-
mittee of the Royal and Ancient was
apprised of the circumstances with a request
for a ruling.
$ Sfc & |J|
“Cleek” : The N.S.W. team to visit Maori-
land in chase of the Ivirk-Windeyer Cup will
consist of W. R. Smith, C. N. Smith, Dr.
Sydney Jones and Dr. R. Iv. Brown, with
W. Dobson and C. Maschwitz as emergencies.
Nigel Smith won the Queensland foursomes
championship, with H. R. Sinclair, in 1925,
and was champion of the Royal Sydney in
the same year. Dobson was Concord’s crack
in 1925-26. The others are well-known club
players, and should give a good account of
themselves.
* * * *
“Claypan”: Queensland’s professional golf
championship Avas won by Dick Carr, who
carried off the open championship in 1926.
Playing almost par golf all through, the
Sandgate pro. beat Arthur Spence, of the
Royal Queensland, by 4 up and 3 to play,
after having been 5 up on the first 18 holes.
A feature of the tourney was the play of
the Maryborough pro., 'A. Gemmell, who was
badly wounded while serving with the Argyll
and Sutherlands in the war. A spine injury
has so affected the tendons of his hands that
the Scot has to play with the ordinary posi-
tion of his hands transposed, but he gets a
very long ball from the tee for all that. He
Avon into the last S, to be beaten by Carr,

AUSTRALIAN AGENTS: R. TOWNS & CO., SYDNEY.
“Float”: That Queensland long-distance
utility test (B. 8/12/’2T) was rivalled by Iv.
S. Hall, of Uerth, who drove an Austin
Twelve from Adelaide to Yundamindera
(W.A.), a distance of 1G74 miles. The track
followed included large areas of deep sand
and rock outcrops, and on one occasion it
took eight hours to cover 114 miles. The
longest day’s run was 323 miles; the average
mileage was 18. S per hour; petrol consump-
tion averaged 23.9 miles to the gallon; and
actual running-time was 89 hours. The car
called for no adjustment to engine or chassis
from start to finish.

“Chevroford” : Parts of the road through
the Coorong, the elongated lake that runs
parallel with and less than a mile from the
Southern Ocean for 70 miles, are perhaps the
worst in,the world. But one 13-mile section
is as perfect a speedway as the Florida fore-
shore on which Segrave made his record.
Its foundation is hard, ivory-smooth pipe-
clay ; it has a natural top-dressing of sand,
and even the most ancient Fords forget their
age when they are on it. If this track were
near Melbourne or Sydney it would make a
fortune for its owners.

are preparing to beat Major Segrave’s 203
m.p.h. record is being built by the Stutz
Company and will have an engine of a trifle
less than four litres capacity, with a power
equivalent of 400 b.h.p. The car’s own
speed is to supply the supercharging effect,
and the resources of the Federal Air Force
have been placed at the designers’ disposal
for carrying out aerodynamic tests. Frank
Lockhart, who holds the American speed
record*with 170 m.p.h., has been selected as
•the driver of the new ’bus.

“Trans” : Two Victorian riders, R. McLel-
lan and S. Gordon recently completed a
trip from Adelaide to Darwin and back in
an Indian Chief motor-cycle and side-car,
and claim to be the first to do the trick.
They left Adelaide in August, and reached
Darwin on September 29; their actual trav-
elling time was 20 days, an average of 150
miles a day, though no attempt was made to
, put up time records. On their return to
Adfelaide the journey was extended to Syd-
ney. At the end of the 5700-mile journey
both the machine and the original Goodyear
tyres were in excellent condition.
' "Trembler": One Charles Kilmeyer has
driven a standard Whippet roadster from
Sacramento, California, to New York in
five days three hours. The distance is 3205
miles. A short halt was made each day for
rest, food and fuel replenishment; the speed
most of the way was between 50 and 60
m.p.h. Considering that the route lay across
the Rockies and other considerable mountain
ranges, the feat says as much for the Ameri-
can roads as it does for the car.

“Ball Race” : The N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union
has completed arrangements for the trials
which are to determine the selection of the
track cyclists to go to Amsterdam. These will
be held at Sydney Sports Ground on January
7, 10 and 14, and will include a three-
quarter-mile race —as a test for the Olympic
1000 metres event —and an individual time
test over a kilometre. Each State is entitled
, to send four representatives, entries closing
on December 17. The Australian amateur
championships are to be held concurrently
with the Olympic tests and on the same
track.
Miscellaneous
The Waratahs met with their second de-
feat last week; Pontypool, one of the less
prominent Welsh clubs, beat them 6-3. The
visitors played most of their second string,
and the story of the Oxford match was re-
peated in the failure of the re-adjusted side
to combine, while the Welsh forwards suc-
cessfully exploited the dribbling game. The
Saturday game against combined Lancashire
and Cheshire was won easily by the tourists,
29 to 11; Malcolm, of Newcastle, played for
the first time since his injury at Oxford. It
-was the twentieth win of the tour, as against
two losses and a draw, points scored being
360 to 140. The next game will be against
Scotland at Edinburgh on Saturday.
“Shrewsbury” : The sending of Jack Ford
off the field by the Cardiff referee nearly
caused international complications of a kind.
The question arose as to whether the Welsh
Rugby Union should take action itself, re-
port the matter to the International Board
or pass the offender, on to the jurisdiction
of his own union. I ocal action being decided
upon, the Taffies found that the indignity
of being sent off was sufficient punishment,
so Ford will be available to play against
Scotland and England. The decision was in
keeping with the fine ,‘sporting spirit shown
by the Cardiff team, which pleaded with the
referee to give the boy—he is little mor.e—
r.nother chance.
“Don Crew”: The triumphs of the
Waratahs remind me of a chap who visited
Fogland with a team in the long ago. He
had provided himself with but one suit of
togs, hoping to buy another as the tour
advanced. But the trip was not a success
financially, and in time the suit faded to a
rusty green. To hide this imperfection he
always wore an overcoat. One hot day
when the team was leaving the hotel for the
practice ground the wing three-quarter
stopped him. “I say, Smiler,” the winger
said, “why are you wearing an overcoat on
a stifling hot day like this?” Smiler gave
his coat a hitch and wrapped it round him
carefully. “Well, you don’t want the mob
to take a man for one of the Irish Rifles,
do you?” he growled.
* * * *
The Dunn Shield competition at Sydney
Sports Ground resulted in Western Suburbs
gaining the club championship for the third
year in succession. Jim Carlton, the St
"Joseph’s College schoolboy, won the 220yds.
easily in 22 l-ssec., equalling T. W. McNam-
ara’s Shield record. The track was soggy,
and it was the youngster’s finest performance
to date. W. Mclyoy won the quarter-mile
low hurdles in 59sec., and C. S. Stuart
took the half-mile in lmin. 59sec. —r ipital
times both, considering the state of the track.
Carlton, Hunt, D. W. M. McKay, Stuart,
Scott (hurdler) and Austen (walker) are
to represent N. S. Wales in the Australasian
championships on the other side of the
Tasman.
* * * *
“Spike”: Arrangements for the despatch
of the Olympic team to Amsterdam are at
last assuming a tortoise-like rapidity, in com-
parison with the snail’s pace of the past few
months. The Federal Government has pro-
mised to contribute £2OOO conditionally on
£5OOO being privately subscribed. The catch
lies in the ability of the Olympic Federation
to raise the £5OOO. With only three months to
go, no effective appeal for funds seems to
have been started. If the heads are doing
anything it must be in the manner of the
gentlewoman in reduced circumstances who,
compelled to sell peanuts in the streets for
a living, murmured “Pea-nuts ! Good gracious,
I hope nobody can hear me !” It is now pro-
posed to send a team of 12, instead of the 25
originally suggested. Not much of a repre-
sentation for a country which won three
events at Paris in 1924.
❖ * ❖ *
“Shrewsbury”: The annual athletic con-
tests between Oxford and Cambridge fresh-
men saw Australians well represented. J.
R. Mann, of Geelong Grammar, was in the
Cambridge team which won the 440-yards
hurdle relay, while Harrison, of Queens-
land Uni., and W. C. Wentworth, of the
Armidale (N.S.W.) School, were members
of the Oxford string which took the mile
and the two miles. Cambridge won by 3 events
to 2. In the trial eights, the Australians
were also in evidence. Allan MeCullouch,
N.S.W. Rhodes scholar, rowed 3 in Oxford’s
B crew, which beat the A’s. 11. C. Mor-
pliett, another Geelong boy, was No. 6 in the
losing crew.
F. E. KALMS, ex-lawn tennis champion of
N.S.W., whose recent form has brought
him under consideration as a Davis
Cup candidate.
“Fitzroy”: The vogue of rowing in
Queensland was well evidenced at the Bunda-
berg Club’s regatta when three crews from
Brisbane, two from Rockhampton and one
each from Maryborough and Bundaberg com-
peted in the State championship fours. The
three-mile race was won by the Bunda-
berg crew, stroked by D. Young, in 17min.
17sec. Evidently the tropical languor one
hears so much about was away on a holiday.
“Slide”: The N.S.W. Rowing Associa-
tion’s championship regatta is set down for
the Parramatta River course next Saturday.
The big event will be the State champion
eights, and Leichhardt, which took the
champion-fours title from Mosman recently,
hopes to repeat the dose in the eights. But
Sydney, improving every spin, may upset the
applecart of both, and Haberfield, the
youngest of the Sydney clubs, also has
hopes.

“Fitzcray”: The four-oared championship
of Yic. will be rowed on the Yarra next
Saturday. Six Melbourne clubs have, entered,
while University will also he there if it can

howler, who came off once more in the

find a boat; Ballarat City, Wendouree and
Barwon are to represent the country. Mel-
bourne has won the event for the past three
years with the same crew, equalling the
record put up by the Yarra Yarra club 30
years ago.
* * * *
“Robot”: Sydney tin-hare enthusiasts —
if they have any enthusiasm left since the
legislative ban on night betting—will read
with interest the cabled information, that “an
Australian who arrived in Durban in Sep-
tember” is forming a company, “in spite of
the discouraging attitude of the authorities,”
to promote the dog-racing industry in Boer-
land. He has sent to Australia for 100 grey-
hounds, and intends establishing gambling
media of this type at Durban, Capetown and
Jo’burg. This reads uncommonly like our
old friend “Judge” Swindell, who introduced
the exhilarating sport to Sydney, and, having
cleaned up £20,000 in a few months, left
for fresh mugs and pastures new. But
South Africa is a different proposition from
Australia in such respects. Outside pony-
and horse-racing, the Afrikander has little
time for “sports” where the cash considera-
tion is the beginning, middle and end. Most
promoters who have attempted similar stunts
over there have found the boom fleeting and
their presence undesired. And Afrikander
law has a quick and forthright way of deal-
ing with people whose room it considers pre-
ferable to their company. It just pushes
them through the window, as it were.
He He * Hi
“Bumpkin”: I read the views of a titled
English visitor on croquet. It hurt him to
think that Australians did not treat the
game with respect, if not with awe. He
asserted that it was really great exercise,
even suited for young people. Then I read
an Argus report of an international match
in Melbourne. “Miller,” I learned, “missed
the tice, and Colonel Du Pre began with a
three-ball br.sak.” Thereupon Miller “rushed
Du Pre’s ball to 2 corner, played to the
second hoop and made an all-round break ;o
the sixth, leaving the balls packed [cour-
teous fellow!] for Mrs. Miller,” Miss Steel
“just ran the first” and Mrs. Miller “laid
herself a perfect rush.” Here Colonel Du
Pre “retired to 2 corner,” presumably blown
out. Whereupon Mrs. Miller “fired again”
and “completed her brilliant performance by
rushing her partner’s ball to the rover hoop,
making it, and pegging out.” Impressed
by this description, and remembering what
the titled English visitor had said, I went
to a croquet match prepared to find that
the game had changed since I played it as
a child. It would be no longer the stately,
solemn ritual of yore. Nowadays the teams
would rush to and fro, perspiring freely, and
totter into the pavilion at half-time to be
r-esuscitated by their trainers. I came away
convinced that the Argus’s croquet corres-
pondent has missed his vocation. He should
be writing Wild West scenarios for the
films.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Mulgo”: Some enterprising ’Frisco firm
is trying a shipment of kangaroo meat. If
it pots the stuff Australians will doubtless
get it back and consume it in large quanti-
ties, as they do other potted mysteries. One
can easily imagine kangaroo and beans (or
pork) becoming a favorite delicacy. Tinned
kangaroo-tail soup from America may even
rival the tomato soup that comes here from
the other side of the Pacific.
* * * #
“Gouger”: Queensland’s biggest submarine
cable job has been completed, in spite of con-
tinuous south-east blows. The cable con-
nects the overland telegraph-line at Cape
York and runs to Horn, Thursday, Hammond
and Goode islands; part of it has been down
for 30 years. Vic. Doig, a young Townsvil-
lain, did the job; the craft employed were a
launch and a surf-boat.
* * M: *
“Harold Hardupp”: “Beetart” misses
the point (B. l/12/’27) about the “adap-
tations” of classical compositions sold in
music-shops. Certainly correct scores are
available, but they are called adaptations. In
this way music publishers can collect the per-
forming fees secured under the copyright
treaty to which 30 countries are parties.
* * *
“The Listening-Insect”: One of the pro-
blems of radio communication out back is
the difficulty of generating power. During
the war power was constantly needed at short
notice in unexpected places, and some inven-
tive cove hit on the idea of driving a genera-
tor by joining it up to a stationary bike furi-
ously pedalled. This idea is being applied by
the Australian Inland Mission in the centre
of the continent. The modern short-wave
equipment doesn’t need much juice, and an
energetic abo. can provide it economically.

“Peter Pyro” r The cash-order habit
flourishes like prickly-pear. A ladies’ hair-
dresser in a Sydney suburb has this an-
nouncement in the window :

“0.P.H.” : Little encouragement was given
by Chief-Sec. Prendergast (Vic.) to the
request of Coburg City Council that about
60 acres of the Pentridge area—practically
half the prison property—should be set aside
for parks and gardens. The land is worth
about £lOOO an acre, and when the time
comes for a new penal establishment a con-
tribution of £llO,OOO or thereabouts might be
welcome. The old Melbourne gaol site, or
most of it, is being used for educational pur-
poses.
* * * $
"Spazzum”: The Parliamentary staff at
Canberra grinned when it received orders
not to escort visitors over the costly carpets
laid down for the Yorks lest damage be done
by the trippers’ feet. The authorities didn't
consider it necessary to take up the hand-
woven floor coverings while extensive altera-
tions were in progress. Instead, scaffolding
was erected on top of them, and heavy steel
girders were hauled into position to take the
galleries, while thousands of bricks were
removed to make doorways.
* * * *
“Coot”: The Bank of N.. S. Wales isn’t
the only Australian banking institution
which uses paper made in U.S.A. (B.
8/12/’27). The Commonwealth Bank issues
all its drafts on similar paper, and the motto
“Made in U.S.A.” is the most prominent
feature of the document.
H= * * #
“Prickly Jack”: The trainload of 800
tons on the Silverton Tramway Co.’s line
(B. l/12/’27) is far from being an Austra-
lian record. It is a common sight to see the
Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta train arrive at the
S. Aus. end with a gross load of 1050 tons,
comprising wool, sandalwood, salt and fire-
wood ; ruling grade, 1 in 100.
: != * * *
“Yolk”: The November wool sales in
Sydney closed with competition brisk and
prices strong. Once more fine-quality wools
in free condition were in strong demand.
Comebacks and crossbreds also met a good
inquiry at sound prices, and even dusty and
wasty qualities ruled higher than the year
before. Germany was a heavy buyer of
skirtings, Japan and France bought freely,
and even Yorkshire was more confident. The
Soviet took a large quantity of free-condi-
tioned wools.
“Ula”: A Melbourne publican has this
notice posted in the bar -
Cheques for sole, cheap. Inspection invited.
He told me the other day that the dashed
things were quite hard to sell.
* # * *
“Waiwera”: In Melbourne suburbs con-
sumers are still asking why they have to pay
for the use of meters in connection with
electric lighting. The butchers and grocers
may yet follow this precedent and put some-
thing in the bill for the use of their scales.

Rain—steady, soaking rain—spoiled tiie
unlatching of the Australian Manufacturers’
Exhibition on Saturday. The show is
harbored in the pavilions of the Showground,
and the opening was led by Sir Dudley de
Chair, dressed from head to heel in Austra-
lian-mades. Even the brolly under which he
sheltered bore an Australian brand. But
no umbrella could have kept all the rain
spots off his liglit-grey suit as he inspected
the guard of honor drawn up in the ring.
Here a garden party in aid of Sydney
Hospital which was to have accompanied
the opening of the exhibition was submerged
and pronounced drowned within half an
hour. The Police Band was washed out of
the ring within ten minutes, and finally the
only Casabianca was the guard of honor.
Elaine de Chair and Mrs. Horncastle sup-
ported his Ex., and Government House rooms
were later the richer by a great basket of
lilac and Christmas bells which the State
skipper’s little daughter bore home for com-
pany.
In spite of the rain, the exhibition had
drawn hundreds to the Showground; but
as most of the visitors had left town before
the storm burst and were entirely unpre-
pared, whichever pavilion first sheltered
them they stuck to. The Hall of Industries
and the Hordern Pavilion are closely settled
with display booths. It was interesting to
find how many articles in daily use are made
in Australia- —boots, shoes, hats, tweeds,
printing presses, books, wines beer and con-
fectionery : everything it would seem, except
tin hares.
There really seems a hoodoo on the Show-
ground this year. Rain, heavy, dour and
penetrating, has ruined every function there.
Easter Show, Spring Show and now the
Manufacturers’ Exhibition have simply been
pelted by the Clerk of the Weather.
Speckless as a man-o’-war was the Oron-
say for the Orient line’s Jubilee party. What
the first Orient ship that traded to Australia
50 years ago would say if she could see
this flapper grand-daughter, so to speak,
would be worth hearing. Probably she’d
consider her a fast piece, and point out that
in her day ladies did not litter the ocean
with butt-ends of cigarettes. But, anyway,
the Oronsay’s lieai-t seemed to be in the
right place the other night, for the company
celebrated its half-century by a ball for the
Limbless Soldiers, and the spick-and-span
liner lent herself to the arrangements with
a sort of smiling alacrity. She decked her-
self with flags, girdled herself with roses and
palms and the pink chalices of gladioli, and
turned on a blaze of golden and blue flames.
She swung to the rhythm of an irresistible
jazz band, while on her decks 800 dancers
glided and stepped in blithesome mood. The
top deck of all was the scene of the dance;
for the deck below, where colored lights like
non-stop Catherine Avheels tore round and
round, you steered when in need of a draught
of claret- or hock-cup, with which were
served luscious marzipan cakes, known for
some mysterious reason as free-and-easies.
Real supper, a knife-and-fork wrangle with
turkey, was followed among other things by
meringues the size of Mount Everest, to
which they bore a striking resemblance,
except that they were stuffed with enough
cream to drown a cat in.
The State Exes, came about nine o’clock,
aided and abetted by Dame Clarissa Guthrie
Reid and Mrs. Horncastle, just arrived from
England. Lady de Chair glittered with
diamonds, and her brocades flashed Persian
reds and golds. Dame Clarissa Reid was
lit up by a tiara that made her look like
the Great White Way, but on her silvery
satins her orders were a reminder that life
is not only froth and bubble. Sea-blue frock-
ing suitably served with pearls adorned Mrs.
Horncastle, and Elaine de Chair was a spiral
of blue-silk fringe. Chief Justice Street’s
wife was president of the committee, and,
dressed in fragile silver and lilac,- she led
the Welcome procession that greeted the
vice-res. Following her in the hand-clasp came
Orient general-manager Dowdell, Captain
Shelford, the Premier’s lady and the Jim
Fairfaxes and Florence Aikman. The Jim
Fairfax lady was very resplendent in mul-
berry georgette with opals. Two nice-looking
Raven sisters wore one ear apiece bared to the
breeze, while the other side of their shingle
was fluffed up. The Premier’s wife ruffled
it in cherry and gold. Betty Willsallen shone
like a fresh pink rosebud. A newly-returned-
from-Paris kept her left arm warm from
wrist to elbow with thin diamond bracelets
that are that city’s last word. The
uneven hem was on every second woman.
If it had not been included in the original
design of the frock, the effect was cleverly
achieved by a georgette and lace lean-to —
the Sydney girl is nothing if not adaptable.
Movie-director Stuart Doyle was the
first to claim the kiss of beauty at the ball
organised by the motion-picture industry
in aid of the Limbless Soldiers’ Fund. All
the way across the Wentworth floor went
Stuart to the foot of the orchestral dais,
and there received the chaste salutes of Eva
Novak, Phyllis Gibbs (who might have
stepped out of grandmother’s locket in her
spreading lavender moires) and the ethereal-
looking Jessica Harcourt. Each kiss cost a
fiver, and in close line after Mr. Doyle came
Clarence Moss, of the Kiddies’ Hospital,
and other well-known citizens. As busi-
ness slackened the kisses were offered at
bargain rates, and when the girls counted
up they had made £lOO for the fund. Among
the tables flitted attractive lasses from the
Lyceum in blue and white, and to every
man and woman sold a jaunty paper cap.
The hostesses sold the decorations from their
tables, and one basket of orchids brought
over £ll.
The Kindergarten Union has made up its
mind to found special play-schools for
crippled children. To help this work ener-
getic secretary Mrs. Beatrice McDonald
some months ago started a Best Sports
Competition, for which different sections of
the community put forward a lady fair or
brunette. These were voted for at the
ordinary Queen Competition rates, and the
result is £5560 for the fund. Not only
empty glory came to the prize-winner. Mrs.
Vandenberg, who came first with nearly
200,000 votes, was presented with a Citroen
valued at £4lO. Mrs. Stewart Dawson,
whose husband is the King of Diamonds,
received a cheque for £lOO, and Miss Peggy
Gray, the Business Girls’ “sport,” has one
for £5O to put in the toe of her Christmas
stocking. Last Friday was settling-up day,
so the president of the union, S. S. Cohen,
paid out over a brew of tea at the Ambassa-
dors. Here the committee, the prize-
winners, kindergarten enthusiasts, and the
barrackere-in-chief attacked mountains of
buttered toast and cream cakes with the
energy of a freshly unthrottled vacuum.
It is a pity the Women’s Handicrafts
should put up the shutters, as it must on
December 23. The association was the
middleman between the stitchery and embroi-
deries of the clever but impecunious needle-
woman at home and the public. The prin-
cipal reason for the break-up after 15 years
of business is the inability of the Aus-
tralian woman to compete in price with
foreign labor whose needlework is becoming
more and more in evidence. As to the
quality of the goods, there has been no
slackening; indeed, the last show in the Edu-
cation Galleries a few weeks ago was a par-
ticularly fine swan-song.
The girl with the top-o’-the-morning look
in her eyes is Lorn a Byrne, a happy girl who
decided to make land work her life’s business.
She’s an Agricultural Science graduate of
Sydney U n i.,
a n d learned
the practical
side of her job
at Hawkesbury
College. Her
ambition is to
own a farm of
her very own.
Meantime she
is the sun-
shine weaver
attached to the
A g r i c ultural
Bureau. She
travels east
and west and
north and
south of the
State giving
friendly lec-
turettes and
demonstrations
to the Cocky’s
missus on how
to make a home garden, how to decorate a
home —in short, not only how to overcome
but actually to make a glory of the so-called
drawbacks of the settler’s life. Lorna was
one of the women who staffed the Better
Farming Train, May Moore made the
picture.
If there is anything in the old adage, then
Providence should shower a few gifts on
the Women Painters of Sydney. They cer-
tainly do help themselves. Now they are
about to raise a prize and scholarship fund
for Women Artists. It will be done by
means of the popular Battle of the Queens,
and the tourney will be known as the Poster
Queen Contest. The Allen Taylor and
George Fuller ladies are in to win, and so
are Mrs. W. A. Holman and Mrs. Mark
Foy, junior, and about 45 others. The idea
is a good one, and the girl artist will appreci-
ate the move to help her win fame and
fortune.
Professor MacCallum’s lady has decided to
resign from the presidency of the National
Council of Women. For over seven years
she has led the N.S.W. branch of this
important woman’s movement; and the mem-
bers of the council are giving her a party on
Friday afternoon in the Great Hall of the
Uni. ' The big act will be the presentation of
a portrait of the ex-president. Mrs. Sydney
Herring, president of the Women’s Country
Club, is also resigning. She and her General
go off for a jaunt to Europe in the New
Year.
The youngster in this picture who is
contriving at
the one time
to look plea-
sant and pen-
sive is Wini-
fred Sliaw, the
clever little
poetess Single-
ton lias pro-
duced. Her
fi rs t book,
“The Aspen-
tree,” holds
great promise
—promise that
her future
books need not
be quite so
academic.
With a new
volume of vers,:
(unpublished)
and a play or
two, Winifreu
left with her
mother for London last week. Before she
went she was the guest of the Society of
Women Writers. Her father is a well-
known Singleton solicitor.
The R.S.P.C-A. had found the amiable
Albert Goulds kind enough to lend the
beautiful grounds of Eynesbury for the fair
in aid of the down-trodden animal. But
Saturday decided to give the R.S.P.C.A. too
much of a good thing, and simply rained cats
and dogs. Premier Bavin, whose wife writes
clever kiddy verse about the gentle antelope
and Jumbo at the Zoo, officiated at the open-
ing, and foresaw better laws to protect our
dumb friends. A white pony and a large
bulldog gathered in doubloons and ducats —-
well, at any rate, pennies and thripnies for
their poorer friends in a gentle walk about
the grounds. Cake, sweets and jam competi-
tions garnered in still more for the Cause.
The fete for the Crown-street Women’s
Hospital was again spoiled by rain last
Saturday, after waiting a fortnight after the
date first fixed for the sun to smile. The
stalls had been arranged on the tennis court
of the Albert Littlejohns’ home at Darling
Point, but before Dame Mary Cook had
finished her opening speech down came the
rain. The stock of the art stall, however,
was sold at Mrs. George Earp’s home during
the week.
Still another wedding in the records of
St. Mark’s at Darling Point —the linking
up of Babe Barriskill, youngest daughter of
W. Barriskill, of Chesham, Elizabeth Bay,
to Robert Carter, only child of the Harry
Carters of Darling Point.
Flora Elin Maliood, of Wollstonecraft,
came to St. Philip’s on Church Hill to
exchange vows with Thomas Taylor Henery,
of Lindfield. The attractive bride’s white
georgettes blazed with crystal and rhine-
stone embroideries and drew a daffodil-lined
satin train A froth of Brussels lace and
tulle veiling was kept in place by a coronet
of orange blossom, and the bridal flowers
were a sheaf of golden roses. Two maids
in palest gold chiffons, their skirts showing
the uneven hem line, carried a mass of
golden pansies, gladioli and blue delphiniums
and gay blue shoes into the procession. The
bride’s parents did tlie honors at the Went-
worth.
Kathleen Johnson, niece of the Phippses
of Mosman, was married the other w’eek in
London to Captain Errol Manners. R.N.
Her uncle, Surgeon-Captain R. Hughes,
R.N., gave her away, and with his wife
hosted the wedding reception at the Lang-
ham.
Two engagements have caused a flutter
out Darling Point way—that of Nonie Rob-
inson, of Edgecliff, a daughter of the late
Dr. W. Robinson, to Douglas Fell, of North-
wood ; and Colleen Simpson’s to Trevor Har-
vey, of Elizabeth Bay.
Teresa Clark, afterwards the Mrs. Ilort-
Brown who died last week at the age of 91.
was born shortly after her parents’ arrival
in Sydney, and was christened at St. James’s
Church. The family lived in what is now
the heart of business Sydney, in a house sur-
rounded by a garden and fruit trees. Her
father, Francis Clark, was the architect who
designed St. Patrick's on Church Hill and
several public buildings, and assisted in the
plans of St. Mary’s. His daughter married
Dr. Henry Hort-Brown 71 years ago; she
spent a lifetime in Queensland before re-
turning to live in Sydney. Though then 80 she
was such a keen worker for the Red Cross
during the war that she was one of those
whose services were chosen for special recog-
nition.
Gladys Moncrieff, whose magnificent sing-
ing in “Riki-Tiki” and “The Blue Mazurka”
gladdened London musical comedy, where a
minimum of voice is all that is expected of
the leading lady, is coming home. The
Fullers have been lucky enough to secure
her, and she will take the name part in
“Rio Rita” at the conclusion of the Gonsalez
grand-opera season.
Anybody who desires to give a moderately-
priced etching, woodcut or painting for a
Christmas present can’t do better than turn
into the little show at Burdekin House. This
lias been arranged by Neville Barnett, a
friend of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital,
which gets a rake-off from the sales. Mid-
way through last week the Viking’s lady
opened the exhibition in company with her
two visitors, the small Dame Clarissa Reid
and Mrs. Horncastle. Mrs. Charles Walker,
who is organiser-in-chief for Prince Alfred
and who is just back from her travels in
America, did the honors. Noticeable among
the offerings are some characteristic book-
plates—one or two by our old friend Georg?
Collingridge, and many from the pens of
decorative girl artists.
The tragedy of Mrs. Nelson, the little
grey old lady who looked after the cloak-
room at the Palace Theatre, has come to an
end. She was really only 53, but sorrow
over the loss of her only son, who was
reported missing after one of the big engage-
ments in France, whitened her hair and
loosened her grip on life. The son had been
a treasurer of Williamson’s theatres, and
the Firm looked after the old lady, who went
on hoping that in some miraculous way her
boy would reappear. Years ago she was con-
nected with the State Children’s Relief De-
partment ; she was sub-matron of Ormond
House when that was the chief asylum for
neglected children.
An epileptic working girl was condemned
in Sydney the other day to three months’
gaol for stealing a few articles of clothing
from her lodging-house. There was no medi-
cal assessor on the bench, there wasn’t even
a psychiatrist in the witness-box to help
the magistrate measure the poor girl’s sense
of responsibility. The chances are that to
imprison her for theft was just as monstrous
as it would be to send Owen Cox or Billy
Hughes to gaol because they are physically
incapable of doing a day’s navvying or wharf-
lumping. Probably both the magistrate and
police know this quite well; the police, at
any rate, showed themselves very sympa-
thetic. But there is no institution to which
the unfortunate sufferer can be sent. So
far N. S. Wales has disregarded the epilep-
tics or pointed them either to the lunatic
asylum or to the gaol.
Through the Fire Brigades’ annual appeal
on behalf of the hospitals, these institutions
benefited last week to the tune of £55,894.
Wearne, M.L.A., handed over the cheques
on behalf of the Government to the repre-
sentatives of the various institutions; and
if he had listened he Could have heard the
usual grumblings over the allocation. Cer-
tainly the public ought to be better in-
formed about the principle adopted in the
allotment.
Those two energetic young men George
Brooke and Teddy Cahill celebrated their
return to tlve London concert world by a
recital at which the front rows were entirely
occupied by Royalties, duchesses and the
like. But their second appearance was
really more interesting. A Lady Burgh and
Mrs. Burkhurdt, who have started an ex-
clusive f rockery and smockery, hit upon
the brilliant idea of engaging the artists to
provide a musical accompaniment to their
first big mannequin parade. There is no
news yet about the programme, and we can
only hope that the singer chose “O Sleep,
Why Dost Thou Leave Me?” when some
Titian-haired enchantress entered in a set
of passionate pyjamas.
A young gentleman w r ell known at Darling
Point decided some time back to go and grow’
oysters at Woy Woy. The other day he
landed a pearl. This way. Having got a
slightly higher price than he expected, with
utter recklessness he became the fifth-holder
in a ticket in the Golden Casket, and in
exchange for his one bob Fate handed him
a thousand pounds. The moral is doubtful.
It may be “Go and grow oysters at Woy
Woy,” or perhaps “Never take more than a
fifth share in a sweep ticket.”
Mrs. Don Symington, whose husband was
so long associated with Levers’ plantations
in the Solomons, left recently with her
tall husband for Rabaul, w 7 here his new
appointment lies.

The Union Jack, Australia’s Cross an i
the stars and stripes in close embrace, sup-
plemented by gaily-colored balloons, formed
the decorative scheme at Scott’s when the
E.S.U. held its American night. U.S.A. Con-
sul-general Garrels and his fair-haired wife,
she in a deep apricot-liued frock with embei-
lishment of gold lace, headed the guests of
the evening, who were welcomed by presi-
dent Osborne. Jazz and bridge whiled away
the time, the card players occupying the
lounge, which was dolled up with pink gladi-
oli, hollyhocks and palms. The United States
flag in miniature decorated coat-lapels and
corsages, and committee-members were dis-
tinguished by posies of crimson carnations.
Dr. Ethel Osborne was hostess, wearing
black georgette, over which was draped an
embroidered shawl. In the throng were Mrs.
Eric Harrison, in nut-brown, one of a party
that included Mrs. Rogers Thomson and her
daughter Kathleen, the latter wearing many
frills of silver lace below a corsage of pink
taffeta. Others who supported the entente
were Major C. J. Matthews’s wife, in drap-
eries of iris mauve; Dr. Guthrie Plante's
helpmeet, in a lace gown, enriched with ruby,
gold and dull green beads; Mrs. Harold
Clapp, in a vellum-colored frock, steel
embroidered ; secretary Richard Gipps’s life-
partner, in ivory brocade, patterned in pink
rosebuds; the Monty Grover couple, Judge
Beeby and his wife, Alice Richardson, Mrs.
Watson Robertson, Mrs. Britomarte .Tames,
arrayed in white georgette, and the Percy
Blackbourns.
The Auxiliaries of Alfred Hospital didn’t
have the whole-hearted co-operation of the
Clerk of the Weather for their three days’
fete last week. Mayor Morell set things
going on a day that was oppressively hot;
on the second day it rained, and it was not
till Saturday that a nice blend of sunshine
and cool breeze gave the organisers a chance
to reap an adequate harvest. The president
of the hospital, F. D. Miehaelis, thanked
the Morells for their kindness, and handed
the Mayoress a posy of pink carnations and
rambler roses. Mrs. Miehaelis, Robert Knox,
chairman of the Auxiliary workers, with
Mrs. Knox in a frock of bois-de-rose lace
with shady millinery, matron L. Mann and
some members of the board of management
were to the front during the opening
ceremony. The numerous stalls scattered
over the grounds endeavored, by cheerful
decoration, to live up to the fete’s front
name of Colorland. The stalls were supple-
mented by side-shows, including a merry-go-
round, pony rides, a fortune-telling booth
and a treasure hunt. Mrs. Barry Thomson,
president of the entertainments committee,
was assisted by Mrs. Edgar Dye and May
Rimington, who were hon. secs, of the fete.
Effie Ball, who almost entirely furnished a
stall of dolls of all kinds, was another who
lent valiant aid. and the nurses spent many
of their off-duty hours as saleswomen in their
well-stocked corner.
The Christmas party held at the Town
Hall on Saturday afternoon to sw r ell the
Million Shilling Fund that is to endow a
permanent orchestra suffered by the fact
that the date clashed with that of the
3LO children’s rally at the Auditorium, and
the attendance was less than was expected.
However, the youngsters that icere there
enjoyed themselves immensely. There was
a conjurer, dancing, a fancy-dress competi-
tion, a feast and a Christmas tree, gifts
from which were distributed by Santa Claus.
Pupils of Jennie Brenan, in white tulle skirts
with rose-wreathed brows, swayed gracefully
•n a Chopin ballet. Esther M. Levy, assist,
hon. sec. of the fund, in a pretty watteau
mode frock, was one of the chief workers.
Mrs. Herbert Brookes supervised all the
arrangements.
Students of Albert-street Con. whirled in
a bal manque on Thursday night at the
V.A.S. Galleries to help the fund to establish
a permanent orchestra. Soprano Beatrice
Touzeau. the president, gave dignity to the
hop with a graceful dull gold gown of the
Empire period. Phyllis Drake, hon. sec.,
danced in black velvet and figured satin
modelled on early Victorian lines, and Iris
Turnbull, who held the purse, delved into
yet another part of the past and arrayed
herself in the mode favored by the Court of
the fourth George.
Senator Guthrie and his wife entertained
Sir Henry Cowan and his lady at tea at the
Windsor on Friday afternoon, and invited
representatives of all sorts of social organisa-
tions to hear the views of the guests of
honor on the subject of migration and pre-
ference to British goods. Mrs. Guthrie’s
simple frock was of seaweed-pink, allied
to a stitched corded silk hat in black and
rose. Lady Cowan, who topped a flame-
colored gown patterned in black and gold
with a large black hat, made an earnest
appeal on behalf of British films, and her
husband urged Australia to encourage the
migration of folk from the Old Dart instead
of admitting so many foreigners. The pre-
sident of the Housewives’ Association, Mrs.
Glencross, who is also the president of the
National Council of Women, thanked the
guests for their words of wisdom.
Lady Cowan, in a frofck of magenta
coloring with a dado of pincushion-like
flowers of the same shade around the skirt,
talked to members of the Housewives’ Asso-
ciation, congregated at the Women’s Auto
Club rooms, on Thursday night. Mrs.
Glencross, president of the association, whose
pale-pink robe was diversified with gold-
tasselled lace, welcomed the guest and
handed her a large bunch of roses that were
by great good luck a perfect match for the
visitor's raiment. Madame Lena Conly and
Grace Evans sang, Lady Cowan made a
plea for preference for British films and
other goods, and Mrs. Britomarte James was
congratulated on her elevation to the unpaid
magistracy.
In the wedding of the week the chief figures
were Kathleen Ursula, otherwise TJla, only-
chick of Dr. Murray Morton and Mrs. Mor-
ton, and Lt.-Commander E. C. Rhodes,
R.A.N., son of the late Ernest Rhodes and
of Mrs. Rhodes, of Sydney. The ceremony
took place in the ballroom of the bride’s
home at Queen’s-road—the parties are not
of the same faith—and an improvised altar
was decorated with white blossoms. The
bride’s attire glistened with silver bugle-
beads and diamente, over silver tissue. A
lengthy veil of Limerick lace, a gift from the
Convent of the Good Shepherd, Abbotsford,
floated over white tulle and a train of satin.
Nancy Hewlett, wearing a frock of hydran-
gea blue topped by a hat of mushroom pink,
was a ’maid; and Pam McPhail steered
the leading lady’s train. About 150 guests
were entertained afterwards. The newlyweds
will set up house in Sydney.
Rhona McKellar’s wedding with Tom
Guthrie’s son Fred was a homestead affair,
held at Wopriwyrite, the MeKellars’ western
district home. The bride carried a cloud
of golden wattle blossom, which clustered
around an ivory-white gown draped with a
lace veil that was set with eardrops of
orange-blossom. Her two sisters, Jean and
Mary, and the bridegroom’s sister Mary were
’maids.
This quizzical face belongs to Thelma Fahey,
of this city, who, with Beth Powell’s assist-
ance, will give a recital for children this
month at Ken-
sington Town
Hall to pro-
vide Christ-
mas fare for
the little in-
mates of St.
Cather ine’s
Orphan a ge,
Geelong. This
will be Miss
Fahey’s first
platform ap
p e a ranee,
though li e r
musical
studies under
Dulcie Bland
have pro-
ceeded far
enough to en-
able her to
qualify as an
Associate of
the L.C.M. She
is not satisfied and intends to go on climbing
the ladder. At present there is no thought
of a professional musical career —nothing
beyond assisting needy charities —but as the
young lady has yet to celebrate her nine-
teenth birthday there is time for more am-
bitious ideas to develop. Ruskin made the
picture.
Wearing white georgette, much frilled,
and a tulle veil, Phyllis, youngest daughter
of Mrs. Thompson, of Williamstown. was
yoked to William John Llamilton Skene,
who manages a tea plantation in Assam,
India. Two ’maids, in frocks of petunia
pink with silver lace, were in attendance.
The bridegroom is the eldest son of Mrs.
D. A. Skene, federal president of the
National Council of Women.
A glittering token has been slipped on the
finger of Marie Louise Froones, of Parkville,
by John Strauglian Amess, whose family-
address is Bolinda Park, Riddell.
The Western district has said good-bye to
its most popular girl, Mardi Younger, who
recently became Mrs. Brian Baker. Her
liome in future will be in the Cold Country,
at Sevenoaks, Kent. She smiled her fare-
wells last week, and with her husband set off
for a saunter through Canada and the
United States before settling down in the
Old Dart.
The Austral Salon farewelled Madame
Agnes Janson one night last week, and
some substantial remembrances were handed
to the lady, whose 22 years’ residence
in Australia entitle her almost to be
looked upon as one of ourselves. Born in
Sweden, she became an operatic singer—
her most notable role was Carmen —-and
later trained aspiring songbirds at the Uni.
Con. She has resigned that post and in-
tends to live in Sydney. H. A. Thomson,
who acted as spokesman for many friends
and admirers of the pleasant singer, handed
her a cheque as a parting gift. Swedish
Consul Helin produced a similar present,
subscribed by the Scandinavian community
in this State, and kindly letters were read
from Dame Nellie Melba and the Vic.
Vocalists’ Society. After saying her thanks
Madame Janson sang a couple of numbers
from the Bizet opera in which she scored so
many triumphs in Europe. Other soloists
were Madame Elsie Davies, Mary liusden,
Myra Christiansen and Gini Scott, and the
Lyric Choral Society’s choir was also heard.
This is Mabel Down, of St. Kilda, who
has the gift of being able to weave melodies
to fit verses, grave or gay. The late Howard
White sang her “Out of the South” at his
last concert
here, and took
back to Eng-
land her fine
setting of Ber-
nard Cronin’s
poem “T h e
North Wind.”
“The Three
Angels,” pub-
lished by Allan
and Co., was a
favor ite in
many camps
during the Big
Scrap. Miss
Down received
all her musical
training from
the late Mrs.
\V. Hatch, who
held Parisian
diplomas and
taught a very
limited num-
her of pupils. A children’s operetta, some
pieces for piano and violin and some pianistic
backgrounds for monologues—Lorna Reid has
used many of them —stand to Miss Down’s
credit. She gained fourth place in the
Australian song competition in connection
with the Duke of York’s visit, for which
there were 630 entries, beating all other
women composers.
Once again Esme Allee is gathering cheer
for the children of lighthouse-keepers on
isolated parts of the Vic. and Tas. coasts.
Gifts will be gladly received up to the end
of this month at the Lighthouse Office, 35
Wills-street, or at Anzac House. As these
lighthouses are visited only twice a year, in
January and June, the kiddies have to wait
some weeks before Santa Claus can possibly
get at them.
Dr. Charles Bage launched John Farmer’s
show of portraits and still-life pieces in oil
at the Athenaeum Hall. The artist, who
got his first training at the National Gallery
and then studied under Max Meldrum, went
abroad for a finishing course, and has
developed an attractive and distinctive style.
Mrs. Farmer, who also plies brush and
pencil, was at the opening, a study in fawn
tones in georgette and lace, with stone-
colored felt hat. Mrs. Charles Lempriere
and her daughter Helen, Elma Roach, Mrs.
Conrad Sayse and Margaret Joske were
among the first viewers. Bowls of purple
foxglove cheered some of the vastness of the
hall.
On Friday afternoon Irene Vanbrugh, in
a black-and-white floral-patterned silk coat
and skirt shadowed by broad-brimmed rasp-
berry-red millinery, introduced the Christ-
mas exhibition of the Arts and Crafts
Society to public notice in a neat little
speech. She received as a reward a dainty
book-mark and a posy, and Tranthim Fryer
voiced the thanks of members. The show,
which will be open for a couple of weeks,
includes articles of metal, wood, leather and
raffia, together with needlecraft, jewellery,
calendars, book-markers, water-color sketches
and black-and-white drawings. A new note
is struck by some very fine colored photo-
graphs of Victorian wild flowers, the work of
Ruth Hollick.
Some beautiful miniatures shown at
Cheyne’s in Collin s-street last week were
the work of the widow of artist Penleigh
Boyd. As Edith Anderson, younger daugh-
ter of the late .T. G. Anderson, once upon a
time Director of Education in Brisbane, she
studied art in Paris for several years, and
is now putting her talents to practical use.
Fine specimens of recently-executed pottery
by Merric Boyd, her brother-in-law, who is
well on the road to recovery from illness,
added interest to the exhibition.
A Brahms sonata for piano and violin
played by Rita Hope and Coral Trenerry,
was the principal item of the Musical
Society’s final 1927 concert. These two
musicians who, with 'cellist Helga Bren-
necke, constitute the society’s trio, also con-
tributed a Mendelssohn number. The British
Music Society’s string quartette was
heard in a Schubert foursome. Madame
Gregor Wood and her husband supplied
attractive vocal fare, and May Tellefsen,
who tackled the difficult “Etudes Symphoni-
ques” of Schumann, showed considerable
pianistic promise.
Dame Nellie Melba, looking radiant in
white with a glistening of moonlight-blue
fringe and wearing a bandeau of diamonds,
was quite close to the stage at the Melbourne
Symphony Orchestra’s concert on Friday
night. She is president of the orchestra,
over which Fritz Hart waves the baton.
Mrs. Robert Power and Mrs. R. Landale,
both in black, were with the diva. Posies
were handed to Dame Nellie and to Mayoress
Morell, who, with her husband and daughter
Sheila, occupied the’ centre of the d.c. Dr.
Georgina Sweet, Dr. Constance Ellis, Mrs.
Fritz Hart and Mrs. William James, who
was enjoying some reflected glory from her
husband’s brilliant pianoforte playing in an
Arensky concerto, were also well in the fore-
front.
Grace Evans’s students had the help of
Benno Scherek, with Paula Scherek fond-
ling her violin and Grace herself showing
li-er pupils how a soprano voice should be
used. Of the students Elsie Thomas, Edna
Johnson and Nance Sinclair were conspicu-
ous successes; and No. 8 on that list pro-
duced some notes that would pass anywhere.
Minister Beckett, who controls health,
regards as rather drastic the proposal of
the Health Commission that smoking should
be prohibited in the precincts of a theatre
or public hall during a performance, and
has given opportunity for protest. He
pictured the possibility of Mayor Morell,
Chief Magistrate of Melbourne, being haled
before fellow beaks for offering a cigar or
a cigarette, with a lighted match, to a friend
at the Town Hall during an interval of a
concert —what are intervals for, anyhow,
now that the pubs close at six? It looks
as if there will have to be withdrawal or
modification of the proposed regulation.
Wallace Ross recommended the abolition of
the Health Commission, and that might be
easier to carry out,
Our youngest hostess, Joan Clarke, has
regretfully parted with Greta Lempriere,
an Australian, girl whose family decided
some few years back to settle in London.
When the death of Miss Clarke’s mother,
Mrs. Reggie Clarke, made the return of her
daughter necessary, Miss Lempriere decided
to come here with her chum and help fill the
large Toorak homestead, the management of
which fell on Miss Clarke’s young shoulders.
Commissioner Clapp has made a bid for

While chasing kangaroos he fell off his horse

Mrs. Douglas and her General are having
a busy visit, being much in demand by
relatives and friends. The lady is a daughter
of the late Tom Fitzgerald, in liis day a
top-notch Melbourne surgeon, but since mar-
riage claimed her she has lived abroad. Her
sister became the wife of Ted Officer, an
artist whose memory is still green. His
widow has remained in her home surround-
ings.
“A.G.M.’s” notes from London :
Maorilanders are having a share of the London
limelight. In addition to Isabel Wilford’s success
at the Lyric, there is a new mimic at the Stoll,
Keith Wilbur, who goes one better than other mimics
by his bird calls and animal cries heard only under
the Southern Cross. His reproduction of a jazz
band distances English entertainers’ efforts. A
musical play by Mrs. Ethel Brumfit, “The Maori
Princess,” will shortly be produced by the British
Empire Academy with a cast of Dominion artists.
Lieutenant L. Keysor, the Australian V.C., met
with a mishap last week-end while rehearsing in a
film “For Valor” at Hounslow. His part was to
reproduce the incident that led to his decoration.
At Gallipoli he threw back the jam-tins used as
bombs by the Turks before they could explode, and
when the Turks discovered the trick and shortened
the fuses he extinguished the fuses with sand and
got off scot free. But in the film version of the
incident the flash powder exploded, injuring him
badly.
“Are You Married?” a comedy by an Australian
journalist, Charles Caston, has been produced at the
Q Theatre. It was described as having been played
for two years in Australia, which gave the Daily
Mail critic the chance for a nasty gibe—that it
must have been played better than it was at Q.
Wilma Berkeley, the soprano Melba discovered
and coached, is in the bill at the Coliseum.

«
N
The world’s finest type of engine
in the Falcon * Knight Six
The famous Knight double sleeve engine is recognized by
automotive engineers as the finest type of motor car engine.
The new Falcon-Knight six-cylinder engine with seven-
bearing crankshaft, is designed and built to give a su-
perior degree of performance that is always smooth and
quiet. It has a flash of pickup and instant speed not
generally found in other types of motors.
The fame of the Knight-engine is built on its record of
countless thousands of miles of service with unusual free-
dom from carbon trouble and mechanical repair—known
as “The engine that never wears out.”
The Falcon-Knight chassis throughout is designed and
constructed in keeping with the excellence of its engine.
Whether or not you contemplate the immediate purchase
of a motor car we should appreciate an opportunity to
show you the new Falcon-Knight models at our show
rooms and to take you for a demonstration drive.

Ascot lawns' are looking well just now,
and bright-hued flowers and grass green
from heavy rainstorms formed an effective
background for summer gowns on Saturday.
Lady Goodwin, who came with his Ex., wore
mushroom-pink and a rose-pink Bangkok hat.
Mrs. Sleight, in cream mariette and pink
with a large black hat, was with the U. R.
Carters, Mrs. Carter wearing pink-and-blue
floral crepe de Chine. Mrs. Cecil Palmer
was also in pink and blue, with a rose-pink
hat; Mrs. M. G. Daymen was in white with
black-and-white check bordering; Mrs.
N. A. H. Campbell was in shell pink, and-,
with Lady Goodwin, went to tea on the com-
mittee-room verandah. Mrs. J. Cadell Gar-
rick wore black and white, Mrs. W. H.
Smith Avas in almond voile patterned in
violet and cream, with brown visca hat, and
Mrs. R. J. McNab wore striped crepe de
Chine in jade and pink.
Their Exes, journeyed to Southport for the
High School’s speech-day, and had lunch
at the Pacific with Canon and Mrs. Dixon
in a setting of pink roses and pink and blue
hydrangea. The De Witt Battys were also
guests of the Dixons. The big hall of the
new school heard the speechifying. Frank
Vidgen won the Chelmsford Cup this time,
and Sir John congratulated him. He will
be the first recipient of the Edgar Walker
memorial prize, inaugurated this year.
The Goodwins went to the prize-giving at
St. Margaret’s, Clayfield, where Lady Good-
win presented the prizes and received a gold
brooch in the form of the, school badge.
Alwyn Armstrong, captain of the girls’
school, handed over the token, and bishops
and judges were in the applauding throng.

girls gave a ver y i oll y tittle dance

The Repertory. Society added another
laurel leaf to its wreath with the perform-
ance of Clemence Dane’s “Bill of Divorce-

Katherine Cullinane, as the twentieth-cen-
tury daughter of a nineteenth-century
mother, was extraordinarily successful, and
Jack Mitchell, as the father, returned to
sanity after 15 years in a lunatic asylum,
was little short of masterly. The play ran
for three nights to full houses.
Sir Tom Bridges, late Governor of S.A.,
was a guest at Government House for a few
days, but most of his time in Tas. is being
spent m luring the wily trout at New Nor-
folk, where he stays with Dr. Reid before
going to M.L. to tackle the swordfish.
The linking of Captain Arndell Lewis,
eldest son of Elliott Lewis and his lady, to
Amy Stewart, only chick of Mrs. T. Hunger-
ford, was the largest social event of the
week. The bridal array was of heavy ivory
satin, with three flounces of rose-point lace,
each rose’s centre being defined by a diamond
dewdrop. The long train was embroidered
in silver, crystal and diamente, with heavy
r rench roses of cloth of silver. The long
tulle veil fell from a head-dress in Russian
style, outlined with tiny orangebuds, and
the bride carried a bouquet of white roses.
The maids were Ailsa Cullen and Beryl and
Joyce White (Sydney), all cousins of the
bride, and their frocks were of rose du Barri
taffeta, with silver lace falling from the
natural waistline to an irregular hem. Little
caps of net, caught with a tiny posy of
pink roses behind the right ear, formed novel
head-dresses. The bride’s mother wore a
coat of old ivory lace mounted on georgette,
hat with lace crown and black brim, and an
ermine necklet. The Lewis lady was in
mole and blue georgette and velvet. At the
reception at Ilatheway House later, the
rooms were decorated with roses of every
shade, mingled with delphiniums. The
bride cut the cake with her husband’s
sword.
Mrs. Kerr Cameron, a daughter of the
O’Grady, is spending a couple of months at
Government House with her two small
daughters.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
Adelaide was sorry to lose Sir Tom
Bridges. His recent sale of paintings, the
work of years, in the interests of the limbless
soldiers, has made us realise, perhaps rather
late, that he is a jolly good fellow. The gift
of £3OO was very useful to the disabled Dig-
gers. He had a great farewell at the North-
terrace station when he left for Melbourne
on his way to Tasmania, where he will bo
the guest of the O’Grady. Later he goes to
Maoriland on a fishing excursion.
The Henley-on-Torrens festival was held
under conditions that called for furs rather
than summer frocks, and the Floating Palais
reaped a harvest, as people had to dance to
keep warm. The Bruce lady judged the
decorated boats, and the effective mah jongg
effort of the Barcarolle Ladies’ Rowing Club
was given a first prize. Rowing men, past
and present, rolled up in full force, but the
poor attendance of the general public left
the Rowing Association a few hundred
pounds on the wrong side of the ledger.
Lavington Bonython has relieved Wallace
Bruce of the mayoral gold chain. The Bruces
became very popular during their civic reigu.
The Bonythons have had previous experi-
ence in office, and should fill the position
admirably.
Clive Carey is responsible for a new
departure in connection with the Elder Con.,
the opera class giving performances with
appropriate scenery and costume. The class
has produced scenes from Mozart’s “Mar-
riage of Figaro - ’ and Gluck’s “Orpheus.”
Madame Dorothy Back, who scored a suc-
cess in Melbourne some months ago with
Clive Carey in operatic concert items, played
the Countess in the Mozart opera with much
vivacity, and Edna Lawrence, who had the
name-part in “Orpheus,” acquitted herself
well. Hilda Barnes Appeared as Eurydice,
and Isabel Burton as Love.
Muriel Farr was a passenger by the Com-
orin fov India, where she will be the guest
of Sir Anderson and Lady Martin, who
visited Australia last year. Travelling by
the same boat was Mrs. Theodore Bruce,
returning to a son and daughter in England.
She hopes to see Adelaide again in three
years’ time.
For Helene Taylor’s second concert on

Winifred Guy’s poster show in the art hall
of the Technical School had a vice-regal
kick-off. Bertram Mackennal’s “Speed,” ad-
vertising Scottish railways, came in for lots
of praise. Griffenhagen, Orpen and Jack are
among famous artists represented. Miss
Guy, who has in her possession over a thou-
sand posters, was a school-teacher in
Brighton, where she invented a scheme for
interesting her pupils in the Dominions by
means of posters. She has managed to see a
great deal of Australia, earning her way
with her exhibitions and collecting Aus-
tralian travel posters which she will show
in England on her return.
An engagement which had its genesis on
fairway and putting-green has been an-
nounced. Mollie, daughter of McMillan,
C.J., holder of the Women’s Golf Champion-
ship of W.A., has accepted Reg Forbes, one
of our brightest golf stars, as a permanent
partner.
The earnest gaze at things upward and
onward, caught for this page by a Milton
camera, emanates from Agnes Brown, a
young musi-
cian who has
made a very
practical use
of her talents
and has also
gained a great
deal of valu-
able experi-
ence in the
process. In her
early teens
her pianoforte
technique was
sufficiently ad-
vanced to
secure her an
engagement as
orchestral
pianist with a
Union Thea-
tres touring
show, and for
some time past
she has been
the organist of the orchestra of the Prince
of Wales Theatre, of which her dad is the
manager.
The latest news of Phyllis Turner, the
young contralto who left this State a couple

bagged the champion cup at the North Lou-
don Musical Festival. She has two other
cups already, one from Bristol Eisteddfod
and the other from the Stratford Festival,
and 12 medals, some of which are for piano-
forte and elocution. Also she won the
Sainton Dolby prize for singing at the
R.A.M., and is an L.R.A.M., an A.R.C.M.
and an A.I.L.A.M.

would tell a girl “Thou art my heart’s jewel”?
Story is about as convincing as a summer resort’s
board bill. .. .Ex-patient: Well, he also included in
the same category a large section of his own pro-
fession ; so he obviously didn’t refer to them all
as quacks 5.8. M.: As shapeless as a splodge

“Wisp” did not live up to its promise. ...L.S.W.:

TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
F. 8.: Fewer scratches and firmer lines, please
H.C.F.: Perspective all wrong, and figures need re-
drawing G.V.P.: One pun was more than enough.

sodden. .. .T.D.: You have no bent for it. .. . Y.A.P.:

THE INKY WAY.
“Leo Lear”: The Adelaide Register is
not the only paper in these parts that was
originally printed in London. In 1841 Smith,
Elder and Co. published the Australian
and New Zealand Monthly in Cornhill,
and distributed it in “the colonies.”
“Iron Acton” : Perkins, M.11.R., who used
his Parliamentary position a few weeks ago
to make an abusive and offensive attack on
an occupant of the press gallery, is under-
going a punishment which perhaps fits his
offence as appositely as anything W. S.
Gilbert could have devised. When he rises
to speak the press gallery empties; only
Hansard reports him nowadays.
“Bi”: Item from the country news of
Melbourne Argus :
KOROIT.
A concert in aid of the Association for the
Advancement of the Blond resulted in a profit of
£l7 3s.
Can it be that Koroit gentlemen prefer
brunettes?
“Jobber”: My first par appealed on the
Red Page when I was 15, and 1 carried it
about until the paper went back to its
original pulp. During the succeeding 29
years I have appeared in every page except
the last. During the big scrap I had better
luck than many contributors at the Front,
getting pars through from the Peninsula,
unread by the Censor on my giving him my
word of honor that thg envelope contained
nothing but soldier stories of no military
value. I had the same experience in France
and Egypt.
Grave Snatcher”: Something unique in
the way of an amende honorable from the
Rabaul Times f25/11 /"27) :
The Times apologises for and withdraws the allega-
tions of dishonesty made against Mr. -. They were
made in a time of stress and trouble. It is further
regretted that a notice of this nature did not appear
in our last issue.—-E.V.H.
And the management of the Times absolutely de-
clines to be associated with this apology.—C. H
Hughes.
“Cog” : The Bulletin payment which I
appreciated above all others was one made,
at my own request, in kind. I had smuggled
a par or two through from France and had
asked in exchange, if they should prove
acceptable, some tobacco and cigarettes in
return. In the push of August, TB, we had
outdistanced canteen and Comforts Fund
units, and smokes were at a premium. Some
of us were using dried tea-leaves, when the
Bully’s parcel arrived in the very nick of
time. Even the Colonel shared in the dis-
tribution, but he was a poor sport, for my
next par. not only failed to get past him but
earned for me a reprimand.
“Uramao”: A brother wayfarer on the
Inky Way who has had some success with
more ambitious work is an entrant for
The Bulletin £5OO Short Story stakes.
Till he passed the 17,000-word post he was
as keen as mustard, and when not pounding
his typewriter was studying the literature
of the various makes of motor-cars m the
£5OO class. Meeting him the other day I was
surprised to find all his jauutiness had
flown. Presently he laid bare the wound
that pained. The cub reporter on the local
rag (circulation 1500) called on him and
patronisingly offered to sub-edit his story.
He hasn’t got over it yet.
“Leo Lear”: Add to the list of short-
lived publications of the early days Arden s
Sydney Magazine, which came to light in
September, 1843. The editor was an opti-
mist in some respects, for he announced his
intention of paying for contributions “two to
five guineas, according to style and reputa-
tion of author.” In other ways he was some-
thing of a pessimist: “I charge 3s. 6d. a copy
on delivery, no annual subs., as I may fail to
produce continually for that period.’ M ith
the second issue was presented a memoir
and portrait of Ben Boyd.
“I\X.” : The late J. J. Knight, of the Bris-
bane Courier, was one of the dozen Austra-
lian newspaper men who went to the 1 .S.A.
and Europe in 1918 as guests of the British
Government, and saw something of the war-
zone and a good deal more of the home front.
For a while it looked, in fact, as though he
might be chosen as a compromise leader of
the expedition; but in the end it was decided
instead to draw up a roster and cut up the
job of talking at the endless receptions and
lunches and dinners —these latter on war-
rations. Two or three of the party scratched
for all speech-making events, chief of this
section being Geoffrey Syme, of the Age, and.
it was a godsend to some of the others when
Frank Anstey was picked up in London as
representative of the Labor press—he and
William Sowdcn. of Adelaide, were the
most practised talkers of the party. Anstey.
who was supposed to he little in sympathy
with the war, never once made the nervous
members of the expedition uncomfortable.
Campbell Jones, of the Sun was the most
provocative. Influenced, perhaps!, by the
Northcliffe press, he wasn’t at all ready
to say that everything in the garden was
lovely. Knight was always the peacemaker.
PANACEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When my youth was in its flower, and the
world a fairy patch,
Where the gods were wont to gambol and
their glad surprises hatch,
All the riches that adorned it were as
nothing to the glint
In the Correspondence Column of the magic
words “Will print.”
When my turn, as with all mortals, came
to bear Misfortune’s frown,
And black Trouble on his charger rode my
last defences down,
’Mid the darkness and the debris there was
still one thing could mint
Joy from out the leaden metal of my life,
the words “Will print.”
Now that life has riper measure, and my
days have fuller grown,
And I reap at last the harvest of the labors
I have sown,
Though no more my cup of life is filled with
hand that knows no stint.
My slow blood still can tingle at the magic
words “Will print.”

IS YOUR PETROL SAFE ?
Why Risß Fire or Theft ?
If you keep petrol in tins bear in mind the ever-present possibility of fire.
A leaking tin, a tin carelessly left open, or spilt petrol needs only an accidental
match or a spark to cause destruction, worry and perhaps untold grief.

Don’t trifle with dan-
ger, make your petrol
safe.
Tim illustration shows
the better, safer method
of storing it.
The “Macson” Petrol
Storage outfit is made
especially for installation
in private as well as com-
mercial garages.
It comprises a strong,
electrically - welded steel
container, to which a
Semi - Rotary pump,
especially adapted for
pumping petrol, is con-
nected by strong, suitable
piping. A 10ft. length of
Petrol hose with brass
nozzle is supplied, also a
tiller pipe. An air vent is
fitted to the container.
The “Macson” outfit
Can be placed wherever
convenient, but probably
the best place is under-
ground, outside the garage.
Here it is safer from
theft than it is when in
easily handled tins. An-
other advantage is the
saving of space in the
garage.
With this Outfit you are enabled to buy petrol in bulk and
SO EFFECT A CONSIDERABLE SAVING PER GALLON.
This saving will soon pay for the initial cost.
You will also save the time and trouble wasted in frequent small purchases.
FOR THE SAKE OF SAFETY AND ECONOMY
INSTAL THIS BETTER METHOD OF PETROL STORAGE.

-♦
More than the usual allowance of pro-
fessional stiffening has been put into Pshaw’s
“The Philanderer,” which last Saturday
superseded “The Show” at the Sydney
Palace; the second production of the Reper-
tory seasou has seven characters (exclusive
of the small girl who makes a pert page-
boy at the Ibsen Club), and four of them
are pros., presumably needed to lend
naturalness to the playwright’s habit of mak-
ing his characters machine-guns for Shavian
humor. Leonard Charteris, the philanderer
of the piece, is an unreal young snob who is
a leading light in the mixed club where
membership depends upon a guarantee by
Sponsors that the applicant, if a woman, is
unwomanly, and, if a man, unmanly; he
chats in a caddish but cheerful fashion about
the affection that two women, whose fathers
are pals, have for him, and, having eventu-
ally disposed of the one he has ceased to
want by getting her engaged to a medical
scientist who is brokenhearted because it is
proved that the devastating liver disease he
thought he had discovered does not exist, he
stands the loss of the other with supreme
philosophy. She decides that she loves him
too well ever to be happy with him ; and that
conclusion having been reached, Pshaw, satis-
fied with having entertained the world for
two hours with his quaint views, closes down
without inflicting sentences upon any of
his characters—except the unfortunate Dr.
Paramore, who is to mam’ Julia Craven.
But, as Charteris remarks, he may not realise
what being married to her means for about a
year.
* * * *
Zillah Carter, who arrived in Australia to
play with Margaret Lawrence, but owing to
a change in the repertoire intended for that
lady, is only now making her first Aus-
tralian appearance is the jealous, undisci-
plined, emotional Julia, with an occasional
tendency to be melodramatic. It is not an
easy part, but the lady handles it rather well.
Ellis Irving is the philosophical young
bounder who philanders; but it is Gregan
McMahon, as Colonel Daniel Craven, and
Arthur Greenaway, as Joseph Cuthbertson,
who sustain the interest of the play. They
are the representatives of the Old School
at war with the feminist modernism; and
Craven is also the possessor of a liver which
is an interesting subject of conversation,
and which Dr. Paramore (played well by
Harold Watch) hopes will become historic.
His demand that his daughter Julia, if she
cannot be ladylike, shall at least be gentle-
manly is admirably made. Beryl Lynex,
apart from a too evident consciousness of
being on the stage, is good as the girl who
decides not to be the philanderer’s wife, and
Pearl Appleton is pert and flippant as
Sylvia Craven, who has really made up her
mind to be a manly woman. Gloria Mans-
field does well enough as the page-boy to
get the “hands” of the audience at each
of her exits.
* * v *
A packed house saw the reopening of
“Wildflower” at Sydney Majesty’s on Satur-
day. Gus Bluett made his start as a Wil-
liamson comedian in this piece at its first
staging in Melbourne; and, though he has
done good work since, he has done nothing
better than his Gaby. The velveteen gar-
ments and song opportunities of the peasant-
lover Guido also continue to suit Herbert
Browne. Marie Burke, if not quite as fresh
and lively as in her earlier presentations
of the rampageous Nina, remains as attrac-
tive as ever; and Marie Le Varre scores full
points as the flirtatious lady with the high-
pitched, insincere laugh. La Roche, formerly
played by Charles Zoli, gets increased girth
and unction from Cecil Kellaway; Rowena
Roland is charming, but fails to look con-
vincingly cattish as the spiteful Bianca;
Roy Russell has slipped adequately into the
part of the colorless fortune-seeker, Alberto,
who wears a uniform merely because a uni-
form looks attractive on the stage; and
Frank Hawthorne shows all the sympathy
it is possible to display as Luigi without
treading on the corns of the comedy. Acro-
batic dancing by Josephine Head, Albert
I-lugo and Ramona offers good compensation
for the absence of the whirling Cansinos;
the first lady is inclined to be tall and
willowy, with a seeming absence of the rubber
muscles of the average dancer, but some of
her tricks are in the nature of exploits.
The catchy music still sets the audience
humming, although the melodies did not
sweep the suburbs as those of much less
successful pieces have done.
“A Cuckoo in the Nest” will elbow “The
Whole Town Is Talking” out of the Sydney
Criterion on Saturday night. Muriel Starr,
who has been touring with her own com-
pany, having Harvey Adams as her lead,
will reappear at the Palace on Christmas
Eve; in the following week the “Wildflower”
revival is to cease in order to allow “The
Girl Friend,” a new musical comedy, to
come on at Her Majesty’s. The Royal
is the only one of the Williamson show-
houses unaffected by the riot of change; to
discard “The Terror” would be like pulling
a horse which is going great guns with a
12 lengths’ lead. “Tweekie” also makes its
finish at the Empire on Wednesday night
next, in order to let “The Film Girl” in
as a theatrical Christmas box. “Archie”
will last through Christmas at the St.
James, but the Grand Opera House will
cease this week to consider “What Happened
to Jones” and turn its attention to Frank
Neil’s panto, (morning and afternoon ses-
sions). A brief hour of panto, is also to be
run into the Tivoli programme.

The Manufacturers’ Exhibition was set
going last Saturday at the Agricultural
Show Ground (Sydney) with a luncheon
at which the State Governor appeared,
clothed solely in Australian goods, to deliver
his blessing. The exhibition, which is to
run until New Year’s Eve, is helped out
with programmes of side events, band play-
ing, and Saturday motor-racing on the
Speedway Royal. On the opening day the
military display had to be postponed through
rain, but a fleet of ’planes did some stunting,
and the First Medium Artillery Brigade had
its brand-new Hahti tractors out to show
how.the horse lias done his dash as a gun-
puller, whilst the operations of a tank
showed another side-line of modern warfare.
There are exhibits which will surprise
people who are prone to regard Australian
industry as still in its infancy; the exhibi-
tion is big and ramified enough to require
several days’ inspection.
It says a lot for the success of Tom Katz
and his saxophone band at the Sydney Tivoli
that they can star it on equal terms with
such an artist as Owen McGiveney. The
remarkable act the Protean provides has
the audience breathless and almost incredu-
lous. On one occasion there is no more than
a swing of a door between his disappearance
as one character and his reappearance as
another. Dick Henderson scores many hits
with his quick-fire patter, and the rest of
the programme gives few grounds for com-
plaint.

Jim Gerald switched to “The Naughty
Husband” at Fullers’ (Sydney) on Saturday

“Man-Power,” screened at Sydney Lyceum,
is a forceful story showing the struggle of a
plucky mechanic to save the settlement of
Peaceful Valley from inundation. As a
result of cloudbursts the breaking of a big
dam is threatened ; the mechanic sets off
with a train of trucks, loaded with dynamite,
to create an earthquake which will save
the valley. The picture grips as it turns
from the tractor laboring round dangerous
cliff roads to the increasing leakage in the
dam. A previously unmentioned trimming
of “What Price Glory,” which is
doing well at the Prince Edward, is Hal
H. Carleton’s parable picture, in which
he shows the quarrels between a remarkable
assortment of trained animals, who fight
desperately without, apparently, hurtiug
one another, until the philosophical bulldog
John Bull decides to end it all by calling a
League of Nations conference. The Crystal
Palace keeps going with “Seventh Heaven” ;
and “False Shame” is shown at the Adyar
Hall, with a curiously illuminative change of
sessions. Two of the night sessions, which
used to be for men only, are now reserved
for women.
THE SYDNEY
REPERTORY
THEATRE
AT THE
PALACE.
Gregan McMahon as the odd Mr. Odiham
in “The Show”; and Harold Watch as
Dr. Paramore in “The Philanderer.”
A picture with a pantomime flavor will
be shown at the King’s Hall (Sydney)
for a week from Saturday next. The manage-
ment has secured the film version of “Peter
Pan” and “A Kiss for Cinderella,” both pre-
pared under J. M. Barrie’s own direction —
the former is for the afternoon and the latter
for the evening sessions.
Water-colors and woodcuts :
There is nothing very assertive about the work
of C. E. S. Tindall, whose water-colors are shown
at the Fine Art Gallery, King-street, Sydney. The show
is mainly composed of harmonious color schemes in
such scenes as “On the Hawkesbury”; in this, as
in a Gloucester landscape, the contrast of sunlight
and shadow is admirably used. In “The Argyll-
shire” there is vigorous treatment of a harbor picture. -
“Belltrees” and “Sunday in the Bush” are two others
that attract attention.
A mixed collection of woodcuts, drawings and
prints is occupying the Grosvenor Galleries, which
have done with the weird fantasies of the “Con-
temptuous painters,” for the benefit of Christmas
picture-buyers. Ure Smith has some vigorous draw-
ings ; “The White Porch, C'ampbeilltown,,” and
“Willows, Picton,” a view of sun-faded pasture, are
particularly effective. Margaret Preston contributes
enough woodcuts for a one-woman show; they are
mostly well done, but a few are merely grotesque.
Thea Proctor is a less successful woodcut con-
tributor, although “The Swing” is nice; and Ethel
Spowers does well in the same line. There are a few
exhibits of the work of Continental artists. Breslern-
Roth revels in the grotesque; but Carl Rotky is
impressive in “Lake in the High Mountains.” Some
Japanese prints are interesting in their Own way.
* * * *
The legal irregularities leading up to the
acquittal of Mrs. Leslie Crosbie, of the
Federated Malay States, are attracting large
audiences to Melbourne King’s. Despite its
gaudy Oriental postmark, however, “The Let-
ter” fails to conceal the fact that it belongs
in the pigeonhole marked “Melodrama.”
Where Maugham has scored is in banishing
the banal sentiments usually associated with
this class of amusement to the final curtain.
The spectators, having been continuously
entertained, are easily able to forget that a
woman as cold, calculating and self-absorbed
as Mrs. Crosbie isn’t likely to continue to
waste her talents pretending to love a hus-
band she despises. Mention of the husband
reminds this Showman that he didn’t give
Hubert Curling as much praise last week
as he earned. A deceived husband on the
stage is always a ridiculous object. Unless
he turns the table on his faithless missus by
making himself acceptable to another lady,
all right-thinking playgoers despise him as a
ninny. Mr. Curling was eminently ridi-
culous, but he was a touching figure in his
sincerity as well. Only once on the open-
ing night did he raise a titter from the
crowd.
William James at the piano was the most
interesting item of the Melbourne Sym-
phony Orchestra’s concert at the Auditorium
on Friday. The ascetic-looking young ex-
Digger is always sure of a good reception
from the public. Pie is gratefully remembered
all over Victoria —also doubtless in Perth,
Darwin and Kainscliatka—for leavening with
good music the heavy meal of sermons 3LO
serves up on the Sabbath. As soloist in the
Arensky concerto in F minor—the one
with the giddy scherzo which makes one feel
as if hordes of skaters were careering up
one’s spine and tobogganing down —James
was brilliant, and he scintillated almost to
the same degree in the Mendelssohn piece
about the magic sounds and sights liable
to be heard and seen by imaginative tourists
in Fingal’s cave. The clever Victorian had
the scores on the piano, but he did not bury
himself in them as do some other local
musicians. After James had vacated his
stool the symphony people dealt with the
Tschaikowsky Nutcracker suite, the set of
Chinese, Arabian and Russian crockery Ver-
brugghen used to hand round so often and
so well. Some of the original freshness and
delight was in it. The star event was the
Brahms symphony which some superfluous
person has labelled “Spring.” This suave
work was finely treated, especially by the
strings. Fritz I-lart’s pupils are to be con-
gratulated on the best orchestral show staged
in Melbourne for many moons. Dame Nellie,
G.8.E., has recently consented to be presi-
dent of the organisation, so her bravas should
be an even louder feature of the concerts
than ever.
* ;Jc * *
Generally promising playing and warbling
by the student soloists, and frequently poor
orchestral support, was furnished at the
annual concert of pupils of the University
Con. Lorna Trist showed herself a clever
pianist in the lengthy first movement of the
Brahms D minor Concerto, and certainly
beat the band. A first appearance with
orchestra is a panicky period for young
people, and they should at least be able to
count on well-rehearsed instrumental help.
Betty Kelly, a pupil of William James, did
well in a first hearing of a Minuet and Vari-
ations bv Arthur de Greef. Marjorie Schmidt
carried off the honors among the violinists in
the Paganini Concerto; Marjorie Prockter
and Hermia Barton were creditable runners-
up. Some likeable warblers were Isis Wil-
liams, Beatrice McEvitt, Myrtle Wise and
Cscille Bucknall.
* * *
As usual, the Melbourne Philharmonic
Society will have a distinguished imported
Voice to supplement its Christmas singing of
“The Messiah.” This time it will be the
Scotsman Hislop. Dec. 20 and 24 will be
the dates and the Town Hall the place.
:|:
The bulk of modern playgoers demand less
than personality, piquancy and intelligence in
an actress nowadays. Their definition of a
star is—a heavenly body. So Margaret Law-
rence as “Our Wife” is wasting the frag-
rance of her comedy on the desert chair at
Melbourne Royal, where “Queen High” is the
revusical attraction announced for Christmas.
“The Student Prince’s” investigation into the
anatomy of Kathie’s melancholy will probably
last His Majesty’s through the festive season,
but “The Ghost Train” will be sidetracked
shortly to find room for “The Alarm Clock”
at the Athenseum. The management takes
the precaution of announcing it as a laugh-
able comedy. There are so many comedies
these days that aren’t.
* * * *
Max, Moritz and Akka, simians, of Holly-
wood, have arrived at the Tivoli, Melbourne.
Despite rumors to the contrary, they are
easily distinguishable from the ordinary low
comedian from those parts. The theatre is
still engaged with the Di Gatano revue,
though the concern would probably reveal
itself as rather a thin and impecunious enter-
tainment if the smutty farces on the infernal
triangle were excised. Sadie Gale is a grace-
ful little bather in the spotlight’s enchanted
pool, which is also being visited as frequently
as ever by the eight local “Darlings of the
Dance.”
* * * *
Stiffy and Mo’s version of the wharf strike
has been called off at Melbourne Bijou. Not
a day too late, either. It was in danger of
being declared black by amusement-seekers,
who are finding the well-assorted pair’s new
brand of nonsense more to their fancy.
“The Demi Bride” is the brightest jewel in
Host’s Melbourne diadem this week. It is
laughable enough. “Finger Prints” is the
Majestic’s scream. “Melbourne’s Wonderful
Tramways” are also being shown and they
make an interesting film, but if some of Mel-
bourne’s wonderful tram-users were shown
swinging agilely from straps the picture
would gain in truth and interest.

are exploited to the full in Lionel Lindsay’s show of

51 tinws. (Figure audited twice and found correct.)
Goats, pigs and oxen also appear in a sparse manner,
but there is not a solitary yellow cab. Which sug-
gests that Spain is a poorly organised country, fertile
mainly in rags, squalor and the picturesque. Lind-
say has concentrated on the picturesqueness to good
effect. The eye lingers lovingly over “The Shadow
of the Vine” and “The Moorish Market, Granada,”
and the beautifully realised girl over the washtub
in No. 4. These are lovely specimens of realism,
carried as far as the etching medium can take them.
But a too-exclusive search for the romantic is apt
to lead the sincerest artist astray. If the values
in No. 21, to give one instance, aren’t hopelessly
out, writer has never used his eyes on Nature. It
is an interesting fact that, although the public is
popularly supposed to be an ass in the matter of
art, the best bits of realism in the show were
crowned with general approval in London, and, judg-
ing by the red spots, the same diadem is being
handed out to the very same prints here.
Late winter blooms in Melbourne: —
John Farmer is a Meldrumite modified by a visit
to France. In his portraits he occasionally carries
his impressions further than most true-blue Meldrum
disciples would consider honest, but in the best of
his wares now inviting customers at the Athenaeum
he achieves that startling effect of reality, together
with a gawkiness of subject, which distinguishes the
school. Mr. Benno Scherek, the venerable Melbourne
musician, is rendered with remarkable truth, and the
portrait of Mrs. J. Warne wastes no time on empty-
compliments. “Mrs. Frank Russell,” however, has
been shamefully despoiled of her characteristic
charm, and some of the others look like rush orders
for the Christmas season. Air. Farmer, when he
likes, can do careful and sincere work. His still-
lifes have the glow of a craftsman’s pride about them.
Another art interruption from Melbourne :
The public having become intensely alarmed and
restless over the problem of the Felton Bequest
and the question of Mr. Frank Rinder’s competency,
our Entirely Imaginary Reporteir jumped on a
Swanson-street aerobus and interviewed a member
of the committee.
He found him lighting a cigar with a sheaf of
newspaper cuttings.
“I expected to find you looking in the glass for
grey hairs,” remarked our reporter.
The committeeman dug our representative jovially
in the ribs.
“Not on your life, young man,” he shouted. “It’s
a beautiful morning and everything in the garden’s
lovely !”
“But you are being attacked on all sides and
accused of being incompetent bunglers who don’t
know a work of art from a bull’s foot.”
“I know,” he twinkled. “Isn’t it dreadful?” And
he screwed up one of the cuttings and neatly tor-
pedoed a blowfly with it.
“Well, what are you going to do about it?”
asked our reporter.
He handed our interviewer a Monopole and courte-
ously lit it for him with another newspaper cutting.
“Look here,” he said, more seriously. “Here’s
Air. Dingbat, of the Daily Dogseab. He says art
is Significant Form. So, if you will pardon the im-
pertinence, is your old aunt. So, when you come to
think of it,” he added reflectively, “is a Ford car.”
“Here is Air. Aluckle, of the Alidday Moonbeam.
He says art is a thing of Beauty and a Joy for ever.
So is a greyhound stretched out to the limit, especi-
ally if he is winning and you have your money on
him. Here’s Mr. Doodle, of the Evening ’Awk’s
Egg. He says art is a Universal Quality. So are
dirt, death and the internal secretions. Here is
Mr. Whiffle, of the Weekly Wangle. He says art
is the endeavor to imitate natural appearances. So
are a photograph and a stuffed elephant. Here is—•
but quant, sufj. —l see you are a person of reason-
able intelligence.” And he demolished another blow-
fly with the last of the cuttings.
“You observe that the critics all have definitions
but they all happen to be different. There is safety
-—for us —in numbers!”
“And what is your definition of a Work of Art ?”
asked our reporter.
The genial expert tiptoed away and placed his
ear to the door of the room wherein his colleagues
were preparing a fresh communique With which to
temporarily placate the press and public. Then he
placed a finger to his lips and whispered, “I haven’t
got one!”

Pat Hanna’s Diggers arc still struggling
against erratic weather at the Garden
Theatre. Their Digger Quartet is a fine
vocal combination which should be secure of
better patronage when the colleges and
schools break up. At the Majestic Robert
Robert’s Bon Bons have given place to
George Storey, Charles Zoli and the Story-
ettes. West’s Pictures are providing comedy
in “Silk Stockings” found by a young wife
in hubby’s pocket. The supporting film,
“Hound of the Deep,” is the work of Frank
Hurley, who gave us “Pearls and Savages”
not so long ago. The Wondergraph is screen-
ing a pretty French picture in “On Ze
Boulevard,” with dainty Renee Adoree as
the star. The Grand Theatre has a war
attraction in “For Wives Only.” At the
York Theatre, “Camille” is still drawing
tears. The Repertory Theatre has devoted
three nights to a production of Clemence
Dane’s problem play, “A Bill of Divorce-
ment.”
Poverty
Point
“Caesar’s Ghost” : In securing Gladys Mon-
crieff as a leading woman the Fullers have
done well. J.C.W.’s appreciation of the
Moncrieff’s drawing powers was shown by
the rapid rise in her salary. Gladys, how-
ever, had even bigger ideas as to her value,
and went to< England. There she made a
personal success, but could not induce the
public to cotton on to inferior plays. What-
ever the Fullers are giving her, she should
return them good dividends, for she is the
natural successor to Flo Young.
“Santander”: The first night of “The
Letter” in Melbourne resembled the New
York premiere in the fact that in both
cases Leslie Crosbie’s weapon jambed at
the critical moment and only portion of the
ammunition was emptied into the body of
Hammond. In the Melbourne instance the
vengeance of Irene Vanbrugh had to be
satisfied with four explosions, a ready
stagehand supplying the balance of the six
demanded by the script. Looking back over
Irene Vanbrugh’s career in the last 25 years
I cannot recall her hitherto shooting a single
stage character.
“Joey” : Pantomime seems to have gone out
of favor in Australia, but it annually pro-
vides Australians, among others, with good
salaries in England. Kitty Reidy will be prin-
cipal boy in “Humpty Dumpty” this Christ-
mas at th.e Palace, Manchester; Jay Laurier,
seen here on the Tivoli circuit, is to be
chief comedian. Another “Humpty Dumpty,”
at the Empire, Liverpool, will introduce
Vera Pearce and Wee Georgie Wood in the
leading parts.
“Goldilocks” : The mummer liked his part,
and liked the Sydney surf-beaches, and he
had thought lie was fixed for a long spell.
So when told he was to go to a Melbourne
show he grumbled. “I hate Melbourne,” he
said. “I never know what to do with a
week-end there.” The managerial represen-
tative glanced at him sourly. “Why not keep
your hat on it?” he said.
“Craiser” : In a recent musical comedy in
Melbourne the male chorus of bucolics wore
smocks and the quaint costumes raised
snickers in the audience, large numbers of
whom were down from the country for holi-
days. Yet it is a pity, in a way, that the
rural Australian hasn’t invented some sort
of uniform, instead of doing his job, usually
under a broiling sun, in a seedy replica of a
city suit, topped off with a lounge felt.
This unromantic habit of his is a serious
obstacle in the path of good Americans
who want to make Australian pictures.
“C. Ockney” : Louis Napoleon Parker lias
written a play called “Queen Victoria.” It
cannot be staged in England, owing to the
rule that members of the Royal Family either
living or recently dead must not be por-
trayed on the boards, but it is to be done
by an English co. in New York, with Fay
Compton in the title-part. Norman Page,
who staged Maeterlinck’s “Blue Bird,” and
also played the cat in Australia, is the pro-
ducer.
“Goldilocks”: When the Criterion Theatre
block goes a few old boarders will have to find
new headquarters. One well-known mummer
has used it as his Sydney address for 23 years.
The Cri. is the most theatrical of all Syd-
ney’s hostelries; its location on Povierty
Point helped- it to that distinction decades
ago. And not all those who use it as an
address are boarders. A vaudeville agent who
had the job of engaging artists for suburban
shows used one bit of the frontage so con-
stantly as a stand that it was jestingly called
his office.
“H.P.” : Does anyone remember the great
German-American actor-manager Daniel
Bandmann? During his Dunedin (M.L.)
season a bleak, snowy night kept the audi-
ence away. Bandmann was induced to face
a poor house, but jibbed when snow came
through the leaky roof and walked off.
Smythe rushed round from the front to say
that the local critics thought his performance
superb. The “much-travelled” knew his man.
Bandmann resumed operations after a scene-
shifter had blocked up the roof.
“I. Phelps”: Leon Gordon (B. 8/12/’271
is bringing as leading lady Gwynneth Gor-
don—no relation, by the way. Among the
plays in which he will be head man are
Gerald du Maurier’s “Interference” and a
Noo Yoik shocker called “Crime,” as well
as “The Trial of Mary Dugan.” This last
has dripped off the pen of Bayard Veiller,
author of “Within the Law” and “The Thir-
teenth Chair.” Its novelty lies in the fact
that the whole of its story is enacted in
a court-room, and the usual theatrical inter-
vals are missing.
“L.H.”: Years before he thought of writ-
ing “The Mystery of a Hansom Cab,” Fergus
Hume turned out a play. He called it “A
Woman's Scorn”; it was produced at the
Queen’s Theatre in Princes-street, Dunedin
(M.L.). Naturally, the funny fellows of
his acquaintance never missed an oppor-
tunity of asking him how the Woman's
Corn was. Possibly because of this experience
Hume did no more theatrical work, though
some of his novels have been dramatised,
notably “The Cab” and “Madame Midas.’
“Dr. Nil ,f : A good opportunity of compar-
ing English with American films was pre-
sented in Adelaide when “Blighty” and “Is
Zat So?” appeared on the same programme.
In “Blighty,” with Ellaline Terriss and sev-
eral other fine artists doing the leading parts,
the acting was excellent; there was no exag-
gerated face-play or overdone gesticulation.
And the play itself was clean-cut and free
from padding and explicit enough to have
gone without sub-titles. The American film-
farce was all that one expects to see when a
Hollywood perdoocer is trying to be funny.
Back-falls, giving lengthy views of southern
aspects; trousers coming down; hideous
grimaces and incessant gum-chewing. And
yet the English production ended in silence,
whereas the audience screamed with joy at
the Yank fillum, especially the trousers part.
“H.G.F.”: Irving Sayles, the negro com-
edian, had the strongest objection to being
called “coon” off the stage. He did not mind
Les Warton addressing him as such on the
stage, but outside! Once when visiting a
gaol—a habit he had—Sayles was addressed
by a long-distance prisoner who knew his
sensitiveness on the subject. “What am de
time, coon?” the convict said. “You (loan
wanta know de time,” Irving replied; "you
ain’t goin’ nowhere.”
“L de R.”: Despite the laudations, I can’t
quite see how the reported rise to fortune
of Frank Neil will benefit the Australian
stage. Up to date Neil has practically con-
fined himself to the silliest and lowest form
of American farce. His methods of pro-
duction are of the crudest. A Neil play
is one long bellow, into which is shoved any
bit of irrelevant business that will raise a
laugh from the most moronic section of the
audience. There are capable actors in the
Neil companies, but their capacity isn’t
noticed in the din. Field Fisher was an
engaging comedian under J.C.W, manage-
ment. Under the Neil direction he threatens
to become merely a noise. Of course, it
may be that the actor-manager and now
theatre-owner intends .to raise his standards
as his prosperity grows, but bad habits are
hard to get out of.
“Cauboy”; The Fullers have bought an
Italian opera company and propose to launch
it on Australia in March. As this is the
month tentatively selected by the Firm for
its gr’opera season, some interesting things
should happen. Two hordes of Latins may
be deposited simultaneously on our wharves.
Two clouds of press-agents will then bom-
bard the newspapers with paragraphs about
the lifelong devotion of Signorina Fatanforte
for her maternal aunt and the burning desire
that has always consumed Count Avanutha
to see Australia. Two managements will be
sending deputations to Dame Nellie Melba
to grace the opening night, and State Excel-
lencies will be compelled to grant precedence
to one or the other and cause public heart-
burnings thereby. As the repertoires of
both parties are largely composed of the good
old stock screams, it is possible that “Car-
men” or “La Tosca” may be staged on the
same night, in which case there will not be
enough musical critics to go round. Whether
there will be enough audience to go round
remains to be seen.
“St. John’s Wood” (Lond.) : Henry Wood,
nothing if not original, has set the English
musical world agape with the collection of
wood-winds he got together to reproduce the
tone-colors of Bach’s time. For “St. Mat-
thew Passion” at the Norwich Festival he
had eight flutes, 12 oboes (including four
archaic ones) and eight bassoons. He is not
the first conductor to utilise old-world instru-
ments. Twenty years ago Leon Caron raked
every music-shop in Sydney to get ancieut
wood-winds —or substitutes —for an extract
he was giving from the forest scene in his
own opera “Mata-Miti,” a work that never
saw the light save in scraps at Sydney con-
certs
THE LIMIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Aye, times are hard, you bet your life they
are,”
He told me as he set his pewter down
And gazed dejectedly around a bar
Which Thespians affect in Sydney town.
“In days like these a Tree might have to
clown
For bread, an Irving strike a hungry time.
Once in Sliakspearean parts I won renown,
Now I must play a Dame in pantomime!”
I signalled to the goddess in the car
(Hebe, to wit) for more October brown
(Mere dinner-ale sounds less poetic, far).
“Come blow the froth off this,” quoth I,
“and drown
Thoughts of that reddened nose, that dingy
gown,
Those shapeless bluchers with the part that
chime.”
“Ah, cut it out,” he muttered with a frown,
“I gotter to be a Dame in pantomime.”
REHEARSAL.
“The stage manager swore terribly at me, so I asked him to please use a language 1
understood.”
“Yes. and then?”
“Well, the brute meowed.”
He gulped his beer and chewed on a cigar.
“A Dame!” he growled and qualified the
noun—
“A blanky Dame, and I was once a star
Till movies knocked our calling upside-
down ;
A shining star and now, poor luckless
lown !
Like Lucifer I fall from the sublime,
To be—the crown, for sure, of sorrow’s

In youth with Julius Knight upon a par,
Belike an Asche or Wilkie in liis prime,
Scant wonder that he felt it as a jar
To be a scraggy Dame in pantomime.

Alemite Penetrating Oil
ŧ
A graphite lubricant de-
signed especially for use
where extreme penetrating
qualities are essential. Un-
excelled for lubricating mo-
tor car springs. Works in
between the spring leaves
without jacking up the car.
Aperfect lubricant wherever
a light oil is needed. Dis-
solves rust, prevents cor-
rosion. Speeds up dismant-
ling work by loosening
tight bolts and nuts. Sold
in pint and gallon tins, and
1 arge drums. Can be sprayed
on with a special sprayer
equipment.
/
Why
you should ask about lubrication
when you buy your next car
Of course you are interested in economical
driving. You want high petrol mileage, low oil
consumption, long wear from tyres —but re-
member these facts.
First, that repair shop records show that three-
fourths of the operating costs of running a car
consist of depreciation and repairs.
Second, that 80% of these repairs could easily
be prevented by proper lubrication of chassis
bearings.
Proper lubrication means that the lubrication
system must be easy to use, for this means
that lubrication will not be neglected. It means
that the system must provide positive lubri-
cation, for this means that the lubricant will
get to the bearing, stay there and protect the
moving parts against friction and wear.
Alemite Lubrication System is
easy and positive
If the man who is selling you a motor car tells
you it is equipped with the Alemite High Pres-
sure Lubrication System you can feel abso-
lutely safe. It is easy to use and never fails to
lubricate thoroughly.
That’s why it is in use on more than 10,000,000
motor cars today. Why 93 out of every 100
American-made cars are equipped with it at
the factories.
Use it every five hundred miles and prevent
those big repair bills —cut the cost of operating
your car from a half-penny to a penny half-
penny per mile.
Your present car can be Alemite
equipped at small cost
You’ll be surprised at the low cost of having
the Alemite System installed upon your car.
The work can be quickly done, too.
It merely means that the old-fashioned grease
or oil cups on your hard-working, dust-exposed
chassis bearings are replaced by dust-proof
Alemite fittings.
How the Alemite System works
It is simplicity itself. The handy Alemite com-
pressor gun containing the lubricant is placed
over each fitting. A twist of the wrist forces
clean, fresh lubricant entirely through the bear-
ing, forcing out the old, gritty grease at the same
time. You can do the work yourself in a few
minutes or any service man will do it for you.
If your regular service man cannot supply you
with Alemite fittings or any of the Alemite
Products shown at the left, write to any of the
distributors listed below and you will be taken
care of promptly.

Nothing adds to a girl’s charm and beauty more than an exquisite skin and perfect com-

Fifes and Fairies.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
UP the long meadow and over the rill!
Down where the glade
Dips to the shade,
Under the beeches silvering the hill;
Long ways and slow
Our steps must go—
Dusk may discover us following still.
I heard the first strain ere the dawn’s waking
ray,
Softly at first,
Then in a burst
Of strange eldritch music that filled the
young day;
I could not wait
By a latched gate
With those wild notes echoing down the green
way.
It was the song of myriad flutes,
Delicate, clear,
Distant, then near,
While the sky’s space was filled with the
rapture of lutes,
Fifes high and shrill
Pealed on the hill,
Fading, as when the west wind its lyre
mutes.
Ah yes! I know that the flute was a bird —
Some speckled thrush
In a thorn bush,
And the lute in the sky that my eager heart
stirred
But a sweet lark
High in the dark....
But what of the fifes of the dawn that I
heard?
Somewhere up here in the light, blowing airs
Is an elf-town
Hidden deep down,
Where the pyxies were holding one of their
fairs;
Through the still night
By glow-worm light
The dear little people were bartering their
wares.
All sorts of queer little fangles were sold —
Marigold frocks,
Spiderweb socks,
With silver of sage-bush and gorse-bloom for
gold;
Till dawn was near
The fifes played clear,
For a fee of an acorn and six nuts all told!
When the fifes start I shall find the way
there,
Close to the ground,
Making no sound;
Give me a bluebell to bind in my hair!
And when I come
In the morn home,
I’ll bring you a thistledown frock from the
fair!

LILLA GORMHUILLE MCKAY.
Out of Touch.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“\/0U know, Curly, it’s mighty lonely
here. Of course, we have our games
of bridge and all that. But—l’ve
been thinking it over a lot lately—what we
really want is a wireless set. Lots of the
chaps at Rabaul have got them. It would
brighten things up; we wouldn’t be so utterly
out of touch.”
So that was it! For some days past, off
and on, Enderby had been eyeing me specu-
latively, while I in turn had been experienc-
ing the uncomfortable feeling that once more
I was about to be used as a lever for some
suggestion which would concern the others.
By “the others” I mean Stockwell, the plan-
tation overseer, and Baker, the medical
officer’s assistant; like ourselves, on the staff
of the Kiap (District Officer) and living
under the one roof. No doubt Enderby’s
suggestion would also interest Koma, our
Melanesian house-boy, but I did not include
him in my thoughts at the time.
In the half light, as we sprawled on the
deck-chairs set out on the broad verandah, I
could not see Enderby’s face clearly, but
that note of suppressed eagerness in his
voice had not escaped me.
. For a full minute I withheld reply to the
inferred question. A queer cove, young
Enderby, I was thinking. So diffident; pos-
sessing our confidences, but revealing so little
of himself; womanly in many ways, yet like-
able on the whole; much more like a city
clerk—a strange misfit in this tropical island.
So, taking advantage of the others’ visit
to village, he was sounding me!
“There’s something in what you say,” at
last, guardedly, I answered. “But d’you
think a man would be getting his money’s
worth? For a good many months in the
year, during the monsoon season the thing
w °uld be quite useless.”
’Yes, that’s true, Edwardes,” Enderby
admitted ruefully. “But I had thought of
that.”
“We’d require at least a four-valve set to
get the stations through at loud-speaker
strength—l take it that as there are four
of us, we’d need a loud speaker?” I then
essayed. “And what would the whole outfit
C °?, Some thing like fifty quid?”
~ I I suppose it would.” He had become
disconsolate now, but not entirely so. For,
although I had been speaking bluntly, I had,
out of sympathy for Enderby, accepted the
roatter as one involving monetarily the four
or us; and I could see that he had appreci-
ated this.
A breeze rising up from the sea set the
asuarmas stirring. For the moment I had
thought that it was Enderby’s, that sigh.
u you think it could be done with a
enner all round?” presently I said, changing
n i so, I’ll consider about putting
U to the others.”
ctockwdl was the difficulty. I found. In
point of years he was the senior member of
our household. His was an explosive nature,
not improved by his over-fondness for gin.
“Muck up our games of bridge—that’s
what it would mean !” he exclaimed when I
had put the case to him. “There’s a lot of
damned silly twaddle in these broadcasting
programmes, too, judging from what I’ve
read in the papers. No doubt Koma would
appreciate the Billy Bunny stories!” he
added scathingly.
His fear that our games of bridge would
cease was, I saw, Stockwell’s main objection.
He was a strikingly able exponent of the
game, and we others had caught some of his
enthusiasm, with the result that bridge had
become almost a nightly feature.
“We could turn the thing off any time we
want to,” I persisted. “They’re broadcast-
ing race descriptions now, you know,” 1
added, making it appear as an afterthought.
Though never really a betting man, and not,
through our isolation, in a position now to
indulge, even if he was, Stockwell had taken
more than a mild interest in the doings on
the Australian turf. Some friend of his in
Sydney regularly passed on to him a racing
rag, in which he obviously found a distinct
satisfaction.
The shot had told; plainly I could see
that Stockwell was weakening.
With Baker it was plain sailing. All he
said was, “What’s Stocky got to say?”
I went to a lot of trouble on Enderby’s
account; and he almost overwhelmed me
with his gratitude.
“Why couldn’t the fellow state plainly
to all of us what he wanted?” later, irri-
tated, I asked myself. “A queer cove,
Enderby. The poor beggar doesn’t seem to
be overburdened with cash —I suppose, being
a widow, his mother needs most of it.”
In due course—the phrase has its own
application in the Islands —the wireless set
arrived complete with accessories, including
a pair of headphones, which, so Enderby
said, would facilitate tun:ng-in to the various
stations.
None of us knew much about wireless, nor
was there any operator from whom we might
seek advice, for there was no radio-station
at Talmaka. However, Enderby eagerly took
upon himself the job of installing the set.
Even Stockwell showed signs of excite-
ment when we gathered round Enderby,
watching him, the headphones clapped to his
ears, turn the discs this way and that. At
last he raised his hand excitedly; soon he
had plugged in the loud-speaker flex. Weakly
at first, but increasing in volume as he fiddled
with the grid-leak, came the statics-distorted
strains of some far-distant orchestra.
Koma alone, I was surprised to note,
seemed unimpressed. He was familiar with
the gramophone—-the Kiap had one—l then
reflected. But when presently we heard the
studio man announce the next item Koma’s
eyes grew large. Singing he had heard on
the gramophone, but apparently not the
speaking voice. When the address which fol-
lowed had extended some ten minutes, our
house-boy exhibited further signs of amaze-
ment.
“Him talk-talk plenty long, that feller!”
he ventured, his broad lips parting wide.
“That feller talk along Sydney—hh no talk
from box,” Baker remarked to him. We all
turned to watch for the effect of this.
“Sitt-eny!” But the amazement quickly
faded from Koma’s eyes. Shyly he fingered
the tip of his scarlet lap-lap. “Master talk-
talk gammon!” at length he replied.
There was a general laugh, and we left it
at that.
There was no bridge that evening. The
novelty of wireless; the fact that we could
be in touch with the main Australian cities
at will; receive news that teas news to the
world; the variety of the fare —these things
held us fascinated. Unlike listeners-in on
the mainland, provided with newspapers of
current date, we were in ignorance of what
the programmes held in store; and there was
a certain fascination in this.
Yet before long the wireless began to hold
less and less interest for us—with the excep-
tion of Enderby.
“How about a game of bridge?” I had
been on the point of proposing it myself, but
I was glad that it was Stockwell who had
done so.
Enderby tumad quite pale. It was evident
to him that the whole three of us were in
accord with Stockwell’s proposal.
“Come on, Enderby, what about it?” Stock-
well persisted, a trifle gruffly. “We’re rely-
ing on you for a four, you know.”
Enderby hung his head in silence; his
fingers twitched nervously. “All right,” he
at last replied, in a flat, submissive tone.
“But would you mind”—he hesitated —
“would you mind if I keep the headphones
on when I’m playing? I could tone down the
reception so that no one will overhear any-
thing coming through. And I’ll be able to
hear the “calls” right enough—l’m so keen
on this wireless, you know.”
There was some demur at this, but finally
we conceded the point.
In that secretive way of his, he played
quite a decent fist, young Enderby. His man-
ner of play was strikingly at variance with
his general make-up; game to chance any
reasonable finesse, he was a plucky “caller”
and became adept in the art of preventing his
opponents from declaring their strength.
“One no trump”—extraordinarily effective in
his hands, that favorite call of his!
We had imagined that, listening-in with
the headphones clapped to his ears, his atten-
tion would become distracted from the game;
and we were ready to “come down” on
Enderby should that prove the case. But
his play did not appear to suffer; he gave
us no opportunity to protest. If he failed to
hear a call he would temporarily withdraw
one of the ear-pieces; this was rather irri-
tating. but it seldom happened and we let it
pass. The musical items, seemingly, attracted
him; during the “talks” he would remove
the headphones. Music, he said, assisted him
to think, but when someone was speaking
it was difficult, he admitted, to concentrate
on the game.
The arrangement worked well enough—
until that evening. In the cut for partners
Enderby had drawn Stockwell, who, in cele-
bration of a rise in his pay, had consumed
rather more than his usual amount of gin.
or five rubbers had been played; already
Koma was preparing the supper things; and

Zam-Buk is applied to a cut,
burn or other injury, all smarting pain
and irritation disappear. The great relief
this treatment affords is due to the fact
that Zam-Buk is a refined balm of natural
herbal origin and not a compound of animal
fats and zinc, mercury and other coarse
drugs. Next, Zam-Buk

the tissues. Its germicidal and antiseptic
properties are to-day regarded as indispens-
able whenever a wound has had exposure
to germ infection.
Zam-Buk is the relentless foe of the
germs of festering, blood-poison, eczema,
etc. It ‘‘medically” cleanses the tissues,
drives out all pus and poison,
ţ
with new, healthy skin. This tissue is
created cell by cell, so that soon all trace of
injury is removed. Whether it be a super-
ficial injury or a deep-seated skin disease,
Zam-Buk will give results superior to any
mere ointment.
Chemists and Stores everywhere sell Zam-Buk at 1/6 a box,
or 3/6 family size. Zam-Buk Medicinal Soap, 1/- a. tablet.
THE PERFECTLY BALANCED FIRST-AII
it seemed that Baker and I could do nothing
wrong. At all events, Stockwell was forced
to declare that neither Enderby nor he could
do anything right.
As the game proceeded and matters with
our opponents went from bad to worse, more
than once I observed Stockwell glance mean-
ingly in the direction of his partner’s head-
phones. But Enderby would not take the
hint.
Presently, to my surprise, for the play at
the moment had scarcely warranted it, I
sensed a quick tremor pass through Enderby;
he had been seized with some sudden excite-
ment. Apparently the others had not noticed
his agitation—lie was sitting nearest me.
Something coming through the ether had
gripped him, I concluded, and I fell to won-
dering what it could be.
It was now his turn to play. But for
once, judging from that unusually long pause,
he had allowed his attention to wander from
the game.
“Come on, don’t be all night!—get it
over!” Stockwell growled impatiently.
Enderby pulled himself together with a
jerk. Presently, uncertainty clouding his
features, he released a card. It was incon-
ceivable, but there it was: Enderby had
trumped, first lead of that suit, his partner’s
ace !
Stockwell’s drink-reddened eyes remained
fixed on the offending card.
“Speed the plough! My ace, man, my
ace! D’you mean it? Here, take those
cursed headphones away from your muddled
head. By hell, I mean it!”
Unsteadily, threateningly, Stockwell had
risen to his feet.
“Here, shut up, Stocky—no rows here!”
l managed to interpose—to no purpose.
Enderby had turned very pale, but his
eyes were blazing. With the headphones
still clapped to liis -ears, he also had now
risen from his chair.
For a moment Stockwell paused. “You
won’t, eh? Then, by God, I’ll make you!”
he shouted, beside himself in his rage. And
before I had time to restrain him, he was
crashing past me, making for Enderby!
Was Enderby going to hold his ground?
At first it seemed so. Then, with a womanish
squeal of alarm, gripping the headphones
firmly against his head, he hastily retreated
from the table. Now, his breath coming fast,
Stockwell was almost upon him!
“Look out! —for God’s sake, look out!”
I was the first to see the danger, but my
warning had come too late.
I saw the supper-table tilt up; the lamp
which Koma had placed there temporarily
lurch forward. Simultaneously, the head-
phones still to his ears, Enderby had turned,
arrested by the flex as it had caught round
the ledge of the table.
There came a blinding flash, the splinter-
ing of glass, and the room shook. The lamp
had burst; and Enderby, huddled up on the
floor, blood dripping from his face, had re-
ceived the full force of the explosion.
Saturated with kerosene, the mat beneath
the uptul-ned table was spurting tongues of
flame. With a cry of terror. Koma had
rushed from the kitchen into the room.
Stockwell was the first to collect himself;
snatching the dishcloth from Koma’s hand,
he quickly subdued the flames, while Baker
and I rushed to Enderby’s aid.
Muttering brokenly in self-recrimination,
Stockwell had now joined us. “Poor beggar!
It it hadn’t been for me, this would never
have happened !” he kept on repeating, until
Baker, after completing his examination,
sent him off to bring the M.O.
By the time the M.O. arrived we had
placed Enderby on his bed, and with the aid
of a wet towel had him in some sort of order.
“Burns and abrasions severe enough—and
he’s had a pretty bad shock,” finally the
M.O. pronounced.
“I could see that he had suddenly become
excited —something of some importance, or
of unusual interest to him, must have been
coming through the wireless at the time —
wonder what it was?” I remarked to the
others as, afterwards, we discussed the acci-
dent.
For the first day or two it was touch-and-
go with Enderby. But, devotedly waited on by
the patient Koma —for whom he had shown,
far more consideration than any of the rest
of us—h. 3 began to improve a little.
“I’ll bet on it!” Baker declared —and he
was right. For the first thing Enderby did
on properly regaining consciousness was to
ask for the wireless. It was a comfort to
him, he pleaded; his room lay just off the
living-room, and he would be able to hear it.
At last the M.O. gave way. And so once
more the loud-speaker came into almost con-
tinual use —the loud-speaker, for Enderby's
wounds would not permit of his use of the
headphones.
He was accepting his misfortune uncom-
plainingly, it was pleasing—and yet pathetic
—to see. Nor did he show any sign of
resentment towards Stockwell, whose dis-
play of temper, not unjustified, had, of
course, indirectly caused the accident. Natu-
rally enough, although we could scarcely
press him, we were anxious to hear what
Enderby might have to say. But he seemed
disinclined to discuss the matter: “the wire-
less cord —the lamp,” he would smile feebly,
and that was all we could get out of him.
That same week the M. 0., after having
satisfied himself as to Enderby’s condition,
set out on a vaccination tour to some of the
outlying villages; and Baker, being his
assistant, went with him. I felt a little
uneasy as I watched them go, and on that
very evening I had genuine cause for alarm,
for most obviously Enderby had suffered a
relapse. In his weak state he became quite
feverish —incoherent at times. Though he
needed peace and quiet, he put me in a
quandary by insisting that the wireless
should remain on.
“What do you think about it?” I asked of
Stockwell. “The confounded thing’s going
day. and night!”
Stockwell’s reply put me more at ease.
“If he wants it, it would be better to let him
. have it,” he said readily enough.
At the office, on the following afternoon,
I found myself becoming more and more
apprehensive on Enderby’s account. It
chanced that Stockwell, too, was working
in the building—writing up his reports.
“Look here, Stocky,” I said suddenly;
“somehow I feel anxious about Enderby. I
know that Koma will be looking after him
all right: but still I think Pll take a run
over and see if all’s well.”
The faint sound of some orchestra issuing
from the loud speaker served to reassure me
as I reached the verandah of the house.
Quietly I entered the living-room—and sud-
denly stopped short, for plainly I could hear
Enderby’s voice calling me by my name—by
my nickname. “Curly !” He had been want-
ing me, then?
As I moved forward a step or so I could
see through the doorway into his room. My
eyes opened wide; for there on the mat be-
side Enderby’s bed, in a half-kneeling, half-
sprawling attitude was Koma, trembling as
if from some fright; and Enderby, his arm
moving convulsively, was clutching at the
native boy’s tousled hair. Thoroughly mys-
tified, I made no move—seemed unable to,
in fact.
“Curly, you won’t think hard of me,
Curly?” I heard Enderby gasp, still ruffling
Koma’s hair.
My own curly head—that explained it! In
his fever, Enderby imagined that he had
been talking to me!
“It was mean of me, Curly—l said we
needed it because —because we were so much
out of touch! But what did I care for the
news!” Distinctly I could hear Enderby;
and then, experiencing momentarily an un-
pleasant sensation that I was eavesdropping,
I heard: “No, it was when I got that letter.
She said, she said —you don’t know how fond
I am of my mother. Curly—she said she’d
be getting an engagement—quite a lot of
work —singing for 28K.. .. “God ! and that
would mean”——
The sudden intensity in his voice had
caused me to draw back involuntarily.
“Why, of course it would mean that with
a wireless set I could hear her here — here !
It wouldn’t be so lonely then; I had some-
thing to gain! But forty pounds—forty
pounds! And she was in need of all I Could
spare! Forty pounds ! But, if we shared it,
that would only mean ten —only ten ! You
didn’t really want to spend that tenner,
Curly. The others, too !”
Enderby gave a deep sigh,
“That copy of the native ordinance you
were looking for —have a look—have a lodk !”
In his delirium, he had switched on to an
office matter —for the moment only, it trans-
pired.
“Where’s Baker, Curly? And Stockwell,
too? Stocky! Ah, that night I fooled up
the bridge—she was singing then ! That
was why—she was singing then. Listen!
Listen, Curly ! What was that?”
From behind me the loud-speaker was
spluttering out some announcement. “Ender-
by”—l too had caught the name!
Enderby had now raised himself bolt
upright in his bed. He had turned his head,
and with fixed, unseeing eyes was gazing
through the doorway in my direction.
Startled into action by that sudden move-
ment, his chocolate-colored body glistening
with sweat, Koma had scrambled to his feet.
With upraised hand, I checked his exclama-
tion of astonishment on catching sight of
me.
I felt that I w-anted to, but somehow I
could not, take my eyes away from Enderby’s
face. Vaguely I became conscious of the
sound of a piano tinkling out an interlude.
More than once have I tried, but I am unable
to recall a single word, not even a faint
suggestion of the tune, of the song Enderby’s
mother sang. I was watching her son, his
face now full of expression—of a satisfaction
wonderful to behold.
Stabbing at my heart came Koma’s anti-
cipatory cry! His head on liis chest, Ender-
by had fallen half sideways, half forward.
“Him die! Him die, Master! Him die,
quick fineesh!” Blindly, beating his head
in his grief, Koma pattered past me—-out on
to the verandah.
The wireless spluttered horribly. “Madame
Enderby will now sing her second number” —
the announcer's voice came booming. through
the loud-speaker, burning into my brain as I
continued to contemplate that motionless
form, the tragedy of it. Brusquely I turned
to the wireless set; with a resounding click
I pressed back the plug on the singer unseen
.... and unseeing.
The house now seemed strangely silent.
From wutliout came the booming of the surf
on the reef. Between the cocoanut palms,
as, looking up, I gazed through the window,
I caught glimpses of the familiar stretch of
sea.
I would draft it to-morrow, I fell to
thinking; to-morrow —that letter for the
Iviap to sign. But it would be another three
weeks yet before the Administration steamer
would come—and go. Another three weeks
yet.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Paling fence and half-built wall—
Nothing else is there at all
Save a hack yard overgrown
And a proud foundation-stone.
Sydney digs down far beneath,
Pulling out her ancient teeth—
Stumps extracted painlessly
For the beauty that will be.
Hovels huddle haplessly
At the feet of towers free;
But so ugly are the gaps....
City Beautiful?.... Perhaps!
Vegetation growing rank;
All the rest a dreary blank
But that gilt and carven stone
Of a dead man now unknown.
Yet a beauty lingers there:
Once I saw a love-lost pair
Kissing in a near-by door —
Paradise it was, and more!
