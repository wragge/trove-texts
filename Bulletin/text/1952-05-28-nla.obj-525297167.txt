Medieval Architecture
Perfectly Portrayed At
Bury St, Edmunds
TlURY ST. EDMUNDS, in Suffolk,
W takes its name from the young martyr,
Edmund, the Christian king of East
Anglia, who chose to die rather than give
up his faith and divide his kingdom with
the Danish invaders in a.d. 870.
Tradition asserts that he was placed
against an oak-tree and shot to death by
arrows. In 1848, this tree, known as St.
Edmund’s oak, was uprooted and deep
within its wood was found an arrow-
head.
King Edmund was buried at the small
settlement beside the River Lark, the
name of which was then known as
Beodricsworth but later changed to Bury
St. Edmunds, and his shrine became a
centre of local patriotism and religious
fervour which drew pilgrims from far and
wide. In later years the original shrine
was replaced by a magnificent church
and monastery which, in the eleventh-
century, was the noblest and wealthiest in
England. Its prosperity was shared by
the town which grew up around the
Abbey and its market became the trading
centre of West Suffolk.
During the succeeding five centuries
Bury was visited by many monarchs who
heaped gifts upon the Abbey of St.
Edmunds. In 1539, however, the great
monastery was dissolved and thus Bury
ceased to be a monastic borough.
The ruins of the Abbey are still to be
seen in the Botanic Gardens entered
through the imposing Abbey Gate,
illustrated here. A stone tablet on the
site of the Great Altar lists the names of
the revolting barons who gathered there
in 1214. At this historic meeting, pre-
sided over by Archbishop Langton, they
drew up the “Petition of the Barons”
which was to become the basis of Magna
Charta, that greater charter of English
liberty which was sealed by King John a
few months later in 1215 at Runnymede.
This historic event is commemorated
today in the motto of Bury St. Edmunds,
which is “The shrine of the King, the
Cradle of the Law.”
Some idea of the magnificence of this
great Abbey can be gained from what is
left of its ruins, chief of which is the
Abbey Gate on Angel Hill. This
elaborate Gothic structure, built in 1347,
was the fortified principal entrance to the
Monastery attached to the Abbey, and is
a perfect example of medieval
architecture.

THE "BOREE LOG" MAN.
John O’Brien of Around the Boree Log
holds a unique position in Australian
balladry as the chronicler of the
Catholic Irish who, one way or another,
have done so much to fill up the empty
spaces of the outback ; and, after a gap
of many years, it is pleasant to see a new
book from him— On Darlinghurst Hill
(printed for Monsignor T. O. Wallace by
Ore Smith Pty., Ltd.). It sends the mind
back to the O’Briens bouncing off to
church on Sunday mornings in “The Old
Mass Shandrydan,” spilling wheels and
babies at every bump; and to that im-
mortally delightful and lugubrious ballad
in which
“We’ll all be rooned,” said Hanrahan
“Before the year is out.”
But though it awakes these memories,
and though a new book of John O’Brien
verses is said to be ready for print, On
Darlinghurst Hill should not be mistaken
for another Around the Boree Log. “On
May 30, 1952,” says Monsignor Wallace
in his brief preface, “the Parish of The
Sacred Heart, Darlinghurst, will celebrate
the 100th anniversary of the First Mass
within the completed walls of its own
parish church.” Digging up the history of
the parish, John O’Brien has written a
modest little book in prose to celebrate
the occasion.
Thus On Darlinghurst Hill is written
for Catholics rather than mere heathen
like the present reviewer ; and particu-
larly the Catholics of Darlinghurst, or
Sydney in general; and it has the inevi-
table limitations and aridities of all local
histories —lists of priests, lists of churches,
tabulations of “firsts,” all appropriate to
the occasion but of little interest to the
reader outside the special audience for
whom it is intended.
But the surprising thing about it is how
much there remains, beyond the tabula-
tions, to interest anybody who cares for
Old Sydney and Australian history at
large. In its easygoing, light-hearted way
the monograph is really a model of its
kind, full of good stories and colorful
personalities that would make it read-
able anywhere. It has been put together
not by some desperately polite and
nervous amateur, as are so many local
histories, but by a writer who is, for all
his apparent casualness, a born raconteur.
Take, for example, John O’Brien’s vivid
and compact portrait of Monsignor
Carroll, who was in charge of the Sacred
Heart Church at Darlinghurst for 27
years; *
Born in Kilkenny, Ireland, in 1835,
Monsignor Carroll was brought to Aus-
tralia when he was five years old. The
family finally settled at Appin Lodge, about
three miles from the village. They main-
tained the old Father Therry Church there
for many years, and on the death of his
sister, Elizabeth Carroll, in 1930, the pro-
perty—7oo acres—situated in the present
parish of Campbelltown, passed into the
possession of the Archdiocese. Andy
Lysaght, the ironbark Attorney-General in
the N.S.W. Government a generation back,
was a sister’s son.
His [Monsignor Carroll’s] passing robbed
the Archdiocese of a unique figure. Tall,
straight as a rush, physically and ethically,
his long black tonsure-coat fastened at the
throat and flogging in the breeze, he might
have walked through the pages of Canon
Sheehan’s stories. He favored the silk-hat
of the soup-tureen variety, with the two
little tassels bobbing decorously at the back.
The manufacturers scrapped the model when
he, their last patron, closed his account.
He always wore an umbrella which he used
as a metronome to beat the measure of his
priestly gait
In his last illness he was taken to St.
Vincent’s Hospital, but, being unacquainted
with the methods of modern nursing, he
was extremely unhappy. They did things
to him there which he had never heard
of in all his born days; so he arosj at
midnight, and, altogether absent-without-
leave, clad in his long, flowing night-attire,
he made his way up the street to the
Presbytery, resolved to die in his own bed
in peace if not in comfort. The end came
in a couple of days. His obsequies, in the
unfinished building, were the first ceremony
held in the new Church of the Sacred
Heart.
Most Sydney people, with fond
memories of King’s Cross, Kenneth
Slessor’s poetry or Darlinghurst Jail, have
a special affection for John O’Brien’s
territory yet perhaps have never paused
to inquire how Darlinghurst got its name ;
from Lady Sarah Darling, “the wife of
the most disliked Governor we ever had,
with the exception of Bligh.” That point
settled, John O’Brien goes on to remind
us:
And so it came to pass that at a dinner
given by the Turf Club, of which he
[Governor Darling] was president, while
someone in a post-prandial speech was
working up to eloquence about the “Exports
of the Colony,” that bunyip thing known
as “A Voice”—which is heard at meetings
but never tracked down —called “What
about the Guv’ner?” and was loudly
applauded. The Governor was indignant,
and marched out —the chin elevated; while
the band, instead of seeing him off with
“God Save the King,” struck up “Over
the Hills and Far Away.”
We visit Darlinghurst Jail in the days
when the old South Head-road, now
Oxford-street, ended at the prison as a
road, petering out into a rough bush
track used by riding parties out for a
day’s adventure. There are property-
advertisements from Surry Hills, offering
delightful rustic blocks with orchards and
running streams ; the Busby Bore, which
gave Sydney its first reticulated water-
supply ; and the one-eyed coachman, a
veteran of Waterloo, who used to drive
passengers out to see the elephant at
Watson’s Bay.
Property squabbles about William-
street, the effect of which was to give
Sydney the bottleneck at King’s Cross,
led to further quarrels about Sturt’s ex-
pedition down the Murrumbidgee. The
story of the building of the old Sacred
Heart Church, Darlinghurst, and the diffi-
culties of raising funds, brings up the
ingenious suggestion put forward by a
Belgian priest who, to overcome the
objections to dancing as a money-raiser,
proposed that the women should dance
together at one end of the hall and the
men at the other.
There is the founding of St. Margaret’s,
quoted from an article by the Rev. Father
R. J. Murphy—how the present St. Mar-
garet’s Hospital for Women originated
when a policeman brought in to Mrs.
Gertrude Abbott a girl from the street
who was about to have a child ; the estab-
lishment of the first St. Vincent’s Hos-
pital, with the celebrated row about the
Protestant Bibles ; Father Woolfrey, who
said the first Mass at Watson’s Bay and
is also remembered as the inventor of
“Woolfrey’s Rheumatic Cure,” which
“had a great sale and was highly recom-
mended by all the old sufferers round
Waverley and Paddington.”
Probably the most colorful and dra-
matic of all the stories —next to the appal-
ling item about the bushranger who rode
with his hangman and his coffin from
Sydney to Goulburn —is the picture of
Archbishop Folding, “when nearly 70
years of age, with the temperature well
over the 100 mark,” spending a week in
an open sulky searching the Weddin
Mountains for Ben Hall and O’Meally
in the hope of bringing those rather tough
hoggets back to the fold.
The book —altogether a very pleasant
and informative piece of reading—has
been printed in an attractive format and
is illustrated with historic prints and
photographs.
A Novel of Sydney .
Though her setting is middle-class
suburbia on the outskirts of Sydney in-
stead of the alleyways of darkest Darling-
hurst, Helen Fowler has assembled such
a jolly lot of sadists, psychopathic
murderers and more-or-less harmless
neurotics in The Shades Will Not Vanish
(Angus and Robertson) that the novel
irresistibly reminds this reviewer of Ruth
Park’s The Harp in the South.
There is Julian Kyles, an artist so
browbeaten by his dominating wife that
he has “defeat written all over him.”
There is his son Alec, another artist,
driven by the possessive mother into a
routine Freudian complex that keeps him
a semi-invalid. There is James Car-
michael, the head of Miss Fowler’s
middle-class family who, for no reason of
any consequence to the plot, is suffering
from a paralytic stroke and expecting
another.
There is young Martin Croft, the boy
who does dreadful things to children and
animals, cuts his mother about with a
knife, and, at the end, possibly as a
distant echo of Conrad’s Stevie in The
Secret Agent, blows himself up with a
hand-grenade while trying to blow up a
soldier and two girls. There is ‘Martin’s
mother, who seems herself a little dotty
in a mildly religious way; and, in the
background, her mother, who died in an
asylum.
Finally there is Paul Quentin, the
returned prisoner-of-war who provides
the central suspense of the story by per-
mitting the reader to wonder whether or
not —and by what horrible process—he
is going to murder two little children.
These are the offspring of Paul’s friend
Adrian Carmichael, who died when they
were both prisoners in Malaya and who,
before his death, was troubled by his
wife’s infidelity, which she had confessed
in a letter.
With all this lurid material —once she
had decided to use it; which was not
altogether wise—there were two courses
open to Miss Fowler: to write a terrific
drama of morbidity in the manner of
Dostoievsky, or to write a thriller. But
her novel is neither the one nor the other,
nor is it successful as a mixture. Like
Miss Park she softens her horrors into
a conventional happy-ending; and her
whole situation—both the very unusual
direction of Paul’s neurosis and the
Carmichael family’s calm acceptance of
this obviously dangerous person as a
desirable visitor to the household—is too
improbable for serious consideration. As
a thriller it is rather more effective; but,
particularly when Paul carefully explains
to young Martin exactly where he can
find him to blow him up, too naive in
its mechanism.
The story is, in. fact, essentially too
horrible to turn into the harmless enter-
tainment of a thriller; but Miss Fowler,
clearly unwilling to face the full implica-
tions of her own plot, gets over this
neatly by never once saying, in so many
words, exactly what the soldier means to
do. So she is able to pretend that this
alarming central story is hardly
being told at all; and so, with
her grace of style, her charming pictures
of middle-class family life, her tasteful
furnishings and pretty gardens, hoi* pleas-
ing light wit and her nice young girls
chattering about their love-affairs, she is
able to make a surprisingly readable
novel of it, and one that may well be
popular. _ ~
The Shades Will Not Vanish is a first
novel, and, in spite of its weaknesses, it
is quite as effective as the average best-
selling novel published abroad —it is so
competently handled in many ways that
we shall undoubtedly be hearing from
Miss Fowler again. This reviewer doubts
whether morbid psychology is really her
forte ; but she may yet do very well either
in the thriller or in the Galsworthy kind
of novel of middle-class manners of
which, in Australia, being devoted to
romantic exploration of the slums, history
and the outback, we have had far too
few.
VARIOUS VERSE
NIGHT ON A MOUNTAIN.
Night on a mountain I have known.
Velvet purple. 1 was alone.
1 watched the wine-glass moon decant
Crystals of stars, red and distant,
Over the sleeping hill of stone.
I heard the stillness after bees
hived their honey in old trees.
And mist, wave-deep on river land,
Rolled and softly fumed in the wind
That wearies every farmer’s eyes.
A lone bird hidden in the valley
Ribboned its dark bramble coolly
V(ith a song of wakefulness. I thought,
Beneath a moment Atlas-caught,
And bowed in dreaming labor slowly
Weighed the world. The wattle drdpt
A sense of golden snow adept
In beauty on my brow. 1 drew
It down, lucent in a shell of dew,
To light my vision. Then I slept.
QUEENSLAND.
DAVID ROWBOTHAM.
ROCKS AT POINT DANGER.
It is the sea, and not this snarl of rocks,
that is angry.
Just look at the sea and down at the dog-
stolid rocks
At bay, fangs bared. It is the sea that is
hungry
Leaping up at these others that do not
know what licks
Their loins to a hunger-frenzy soup-
bones a-boil
Which they are, standing in the sea. If
they
Should bite as in a storm, they seethe with
madness, toil
As in biting a flea; sea dwindling away,
And they are exposed, show whiter their
fangs for dread
Of something they cannot bite. It is
always
They are afraid; and, like a mad dog,
mad.
Dogs, and afraid! Seems sea’s like their
master's whip.
Let them but sight a mast —to canine eyes
It is a limb, a leg—beware, the ship!
QUEENSLAND.
JOHN BLIGHT.
THE GOLDEN BIRD.
I watched the new moon fly
behind a summit tree
to perch on an upper branch
and so look down at me.
Upon that very instant,
the glowing gully rang
with a kookaburra ® laughter,
while frogs and crickets sang.
I was a dreamy lad,
walking the bush alone;
it was thirty years ago. , .
In all that I have known,
the frogs have never croaked,
the crickets never chirred,
so blithely as on that night
when the moon was a laughing bird,
new moon, a golden bird,
perched high, with beak in air,
when I was a dreamy lad
and the bush was everywhere.
VICTORIA.
REX INGAMELLS.
LIMESTONE COUNTRY.
This white rock remembers the sea.
It is no wonder,
for the sea made it.
It was laid down under
a sea that once
broke here in sonorous thunder,
A mash of shells
fine-ground to silt
settled, drifted and settled
until a hard floor was built,
was thrust up,
broken into slabs that tilt
and seem to run like tidal-waves,
antediluvian waves, across the land.
Men are not conscious now of rock-
time.
They talk instead of improved
pastures,
the benefits of lime,
while the centuries that fit our human
rhyme
are ticking off mere seconds.
But I am certain there have been
men here who were not so deaf
to the sound of eternity’s voice,
who turned from their own thoughts
sometimes,shutting down a curtain
on their thinking and talking
in order to listen,
looked up
at the cliff-top
and saw in the cloud’s motion
more than illusion
of a great wave toppling
above them,
about to crash down and overwhelm
them.

EVATT'S BIG TWIST.
The scene during the debate in Canberra
on “Labor’s” patronage of Dr. Burton,
now fraternising in Peking, was one of
complete rout and desertion on the
“Labor” side. The “Labor” front-bench
left its leader lone and forlorn.
It was quite obvious that none of the
harder-fighting units of “Labor’s” leader-
ship was anxious to have an opportunity
of condemning the wandering doctor.
The defence of their own leader and
support for his repudiation of his protege
and of every principle which has gained
him authority in public affairs was left
entirely to the opponents of Communism
—Mr. Arthur Calwell, Mr. Keon and all
those whose backing would do Dr. Evatt
most harm among the great Communist-
led unions. And though they did sup-
port him, it was with the air of men
who, axe in hand, find themselves
threatened with the loss of the chicken
which they themselves are about to lop.
Very little stress was laid in the re-
porting of the debate on its salient
features. The sponsoring organisation
which is sending Dr. Burton abroad was,
Mr. Anthony remarked, organised under
the tutelage of Mr. J. R. Hughes, a
member of the politbureau of the Aus-
tralian Communist party, after he had
visited the Warsaw Peace Conference. In
the circular asking for funds to send Dr.
Burton away Mr. Hughes was mentioned
as one of the sponsors. As several
members of the Government side stressed,
the same circular mentioned Mr. Clive
Evatt, Dr. Evatt’s brother, as president
of the sponsoring body, and Mr. Albert
Thompson, one of J. S. Garden’s old
Praetorian Guard and a staunch Left-
winger of the A.L.P. Executive, as vice-
president. Senator Morrow, a “Labor”
member of the Senate, was named as
one of those who had expressed his
willingness to accompany the delegation
but did not go.
There are many ordinary citizens who
would be inclined to agree with Dr.
Evatt’s viewpoint that the Government
ought to withhold passports to these
conferences—indeed, about a couple of
million of them very nearly succeeded in
making their opinion, exactly in line
with Dr. Evatt’s current views, felt at
the recent referendum on the Communist-
party Dissolution Act to the extent that
the Government could have acted in
such cases. But the devastating fact, as
pointed out during the debate by Mr. W.
Kent Hughes, Minister for the Interior,
is that the man who opposed their view
night and day was Dr. Evatt himself. The
whole of his effective argument during
the long fight against the ban on the Com-
munist party was based on his submission
that no state of war existed in Australia,
that therefore it was not only an out-
rageous invasion of personal liberty for
the Government to use defence powers to
deal with the Communists but that the use
of such powers was in fact illegal, because
the country was not de facto at war.
It was upon this very ground, argued
before the High Court as counsel for the
Communist party, that he defeated the
Communist-party Dissolution Act, secur-
ing the assent of the court to his view. It
was upon this very ground more than any
other that he defeated the Government’s
referendum to secure authority to alter the
Constitution and make the Act law.
That he should so soon adopt a com-
pletely opposite viewpoint illustrates his
inborn readiness to subordinate prin-
ciple to expediency. Had the Govern-
ment proposed to ban the journey he
and his followers would have been heard
screaming that it was an act of Hitlerism,
an infringement of the rights of the indi-
vidual, a measure destructive to the rights
won by democracy from the tyrants and
a denial of every principle established
at Runnymede and Eureka.
But since the Government’s legal
advisers hold, no doubt the more strongly
because of Dr. Evatt’s resounding victory
as the advocate of the Communist party
before the High Court, that war-
time defence powers cannot be applied
to prevent the issue of passports to Dr.
Burton and his friends, and that there
are no adequate peace-time powers in
existence to prevent their travelling, Dr.
Evatt is prepared to admit that everything
he has argued in the last year is wrong
and that all his arguments for three years
have been baseless.
“Labor” has nobody to blame for its
present position but itself. It knows per-
fectly well that if the Government were
to introduce legislation to try to deal
with the passport position it would find
a pretext—direct or indirect —to oppose
it. If it did not, the “Labor” party would
be torn to pieces from the inside by the
very elements which were so silent during
the debate on the Burton affair.
The party’s about-turn on the question
of the employment of Dr. Burton is as
complete as that of Dr. Evatt on the
question of the Government’s right to use
war-time powers in respect of national
security as affected by the Korean war.
It was Dr. Evatt who, in six years, in
defiance of the rights of permanent civil
servants and of the returned-soldier
preference laws, promoted Dr. Burton, at
the age of 32, to the post of permanent
head of the External Affairs Department.
It was the “Labor” party, headed by Dr.
Evatt, which, a few months ago,
attacked the Menzies Government for
removing Dr. Burton from a position in
which every secret of Australia’s foreign
policy was at his disposal to the junior
position of High Commissioner to Ceylon.
This was held up as an instance of wicked
persecution of a brilliant official because
of his personal political opinions. But in
the debate last Wednesday night Mr.
Spender was abused as a guilty man for
employing him even at Colombo.
During “Labor’s” reign it appointed
a number of persons who were avowed
Communists to official and party posi-
tions and ignored and even jeered at the
protests of the then Liberal-C.P. Oppo-
sition. On its war-time trade-union Prime
Minister’s Advisory Committee a majority
of the members were also members of
the Central Committee of the Communist
party —Thornton was included. Its official
liaison-officer between the unions and the
Government was J. S. Garden, once
a most notorious Communist. It
appointed Arthur Rudkin, fresh from
jail, into which he had been sent
after trial in war-time for spying in the
interests of the Communist party abroad,
to a position connected with the produc-
tion of defence material in the C.5.1.R.0.
It amended the industrial laws dealing
with the waterfront knowing without a
shadow of a doubt that its amendments
would make J. Healy, a member of the
C.P. Central Executive, also a member
of the Stevedoring Commission, drawing
Government fees. It let the con-
victed Communist conspirators Ratliff
and Thomas out of internment in defiance
of the strongest recommendation against
their release by the Internment Appeals
Tribunal. It interned the innocent
Australia First men.
These instances can be multiplied. Yet
in the face of such facts the “Labor”
speakers on Wednesday night of last
week had the blatant audacity to
attack the present Government for con-
tinuing to employ Communists whom
“Labor” itself appointed and whom it is
not easy to get rid of once they are in
office.
It is time that Parliament devoted a
day or two to the examination of the
infiltration of the services during the past
few years by Communists and others
whose only qualifications lie in their
political affiliations. The result might
give “Labor” even more ground for self-
pity than it feels it has at present.
Blackmail and Banditry.
The methods practised by the N.S.W.
Government in resuming land have no
parallel in any British community. The
nearest comparison would be behind the
Iron Curtain. The old-time highwayman
used the same technique. Under this bill
banditry will be suppressed
They first clap a proclamation over a
landowner’s land which prevents him from
selling it to anyone else. Then, when they
decide to acquire it, they write to him: “If
you like to go along quietly we will give
you 1942 value plus 15 per cent. If you
have the audacity to contest this, we will
withdraw the 15 per cent, and resume the
land on values ruling on February 10,
1942. If we do not receive a reply within
14 days we will proceed on the 1942
valuation basis.”
If that is not blackmail I don’t know
what is.
Thus P.M.G. Anthony in the debate on
the Commonwealth Government’s bill
provoked by abuses in N.S.W.’s
administration of returned-soldier settle-
ment, using Commonwealth financial
grants in the process. Interior Minister
Kent Hughes, in charge of the bill, ex-
plained that, a formal agreement between
Commonwealth and State Governments
for terms of State acquisition of lands
for this purpose having been declared
invalid by the High Court, a committee
of Commonwealth and States’ Crown
solicitors unanimously recommended that
the only means by which the Common-
wealth could insist on just terms of com-
pensation for property resumed was by
legislating under section 96 of the Con-
stitution, which provides that financial
assistance may be granted to any State
“on such terms and conditions as Parlia-
ment thinks fit.” The three principal
States, he said, were unwilling to amend
their Closer Settlement Acts to provide
for just terms; however, resumption
terms in Queensland and Victoria were
“within reason,” but the position in New
South Wales was different.
A chorus in defence of the McGirr-
Cahill “banditry” arose from N.S.W.
“Labor” members. They can see nothing
wrong in forced sales of resumed land at
1942 prices plus 15 per cent., but the re-
fusal of arbitration tribunals to award
trade-unions marginal rates of pay 100
per cent, above those ruling even in 1949
is a howling injustice. The self-righteous
Mr. Haylen said the N.S.W. Govern-
ment’s procedure as narrated was “fair
enough.” That other renowned barracker
for fairplay, the member for East Sydney,
thought it “very regrettable to hear a re-
sponsible Government being described as
engaged in legalised robbery and black-
mail.”
But he could find no reply to the
facts quoted by Mr. Fairbairn from
Farrer electorate, where, he said, 28
properties, embracing 561,000 acres, had
been resumed by the McGirr-Cahills in
the manner described at a loss to the
owners of £2,118,000, and he estimated
that in all N.S.W. landholders had been
robbed of some £2O million. Mr. Fraser
of Eden-Monaro, whose argument in
defence of the Macquarie-street Ned
Kellys would make a corkscrew look like
Euclid’s straight line, thought it was “un-
reasonable” to expect the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment “to pay beyond what was
obviously a true value.”
Glaring instances of injustice done
have been published in these pages during
recent months: —■
There was the outrageous case of the
Merriginnie property in the Wakool dis-
trict. The owner took it up in 1876 and
spent his life in developing it for his
children and getting it free of debt.
descendants were forced out by McGirr’s
bailiffs, because they—ex-servicemen them-
selves, too —fought to keep their land
rather than yield it up to a Government
which offered only £4 12s. an acre when
anybody in the district would have paid
£lO for it. When the McGirr Government
was defeated in the courts over this bare-
faced robbery, it brought down special
legislation to validate the disgraceful busi-
ness and pursued it afresh. The family
was dispossessed in the cause of “settling
ex-soldiers.” Yet three families, descen-
dants of the original purchaser, owned
Merriginnie at that time. Including 12
adult children, every male among them an
ex-serviceman!
There was the one-armed farmer of
Tocumwal whose land the McGirrs de-
manded of him at £8 an acre when it was
valued at £2O and adjoining land had been
sold at £3O. He was so enraged that he
travelled to Sydney and called a public
meeting, where among the speakers two
airmen (one of them “just back from
Korea”) declared that every decent
returned soldier looked on the McGirr
acquisition terms as atrocious and many
of those already settled believed that a
Government which could force acquisition
on such terms would probably take it back
at some whim in the same way.
Mr. Cahill’s comments on the Canberra
debate make clear that he supports
entirely the McGirr land-confiscation
policy. He says the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment is “out to scuttle the N.S.W.
soldier-settlement scheme” —which, as
regards the blackmail procedure, may be
true —and that he “will not pay grossly-
inflated boom prices.” This is no answer
to the charge against him and is a reflec-
tion on his own Valuer-General. Any
“scuttling” of N.S.W. soldier-settlement
will be by his own act. There will be
Commonwealth money available for
dealing on just terms.
What is also made clear is that this
blackmailing attitude towards larger
landholders is part of the N.S.W. Social-
ists’ general policy for treatment of all
rural industry. When Mr. Cahill’s late
leader did a bit of scuttling of his own
into a highly-paid job outside Parliament,
the political ill-health that smote him
started with the resistance by N.S.W.
dairyfarmers to his attempt last spring to
fix butter prices, too, at 1942 values, or
something like them. When, in the first
result, butter disappeared from Sydney
homes (but not from “Labor” Ministers’
tables) because the McGirrs “fixed” the
legal price at under-production-cost, a
deputation of dairymen from the north
coast came down to Macquarie-street.
On their return home the president of the
Casino P.P.U. told a public meeting how
the head of this blackmail Government
received them:
He told our deputation that if owners
did not get their farms back into pro-
duction they would be resumed and given
to returned soldiers and others who would
produce butter. He said the industry's
leaders were satisfied with returns, so the
fault must lie with the farmers.
The incredible leader of this “Govern-
ment” acknowledged the correctness of
the deputation’s report and told the
Press:
The Government might have to “permit”
People to farm land as its situation and
potentialities demanded We have the
names of many ex-servicemen who are
wming and anxious to carry °”
....And wheatfarmers have sown only
3,000,000 acres for wheat this harvest, the
smallest for seven years,
The Commonwealth Government’s
action exposes the N.S.W. “Labor” policy
in office towards small farmers and large
landholders as one and the same. It is
the policy of socialisation of the means
of production, distribution and exchange,
to be pursued by any and every under-
hand method of administration if the
electorate will not tolerate the direct
a Pproach. Yesterday it was via price-
fixing and nationalisation of the tradmg-
banks; today it is through threats and
depreciation of prices for land and tor
products from the land,
The attack on private enterprise is
spreading with the Cahill Government s
announcement that road-hauliers, whose
service the community has supported in
spite of prohibitive special taxation, are
shortly to be taxed still higher and also
denied permits to carry certain goods,
This is the latest effort to save the N.S.W.
railways from collapse. The railways
cannot manage even to carry the coal
waiting for them from the northern fields
to Sydney ; yet from July and August on-
wards the Government is going to con-
fiscate the road-hauliers’ business in
carrying beer and petrol. It does not
matter that, following the destruction of
the coastal shipping by “Labor” politics,
it takes the railways 14 days to transport
from Sydney to Melbourne or Brisbane
what the road-hauliers deliver in 36
hours. The railways simply cannot carry,
and till lately never contemplated carry-
ing, the freights that used to go by sea ;
now the Cahills say that the road-carriers
of private enterprise are “stealing” these
freights from the railways,
This is the sort of “State development”
for which the Cahills want more and
more Commonwealth money.
Beattie, V.C., of St. Nazaire.
“Macnell’s” tribute:
Captain Stephen Halden Beattie, V.C., Legion
D’Honneur, Croix de Guerre, R.N., has been
in destroyers pretty well all his service hie;
so that command of Australia’s frigate-squadron
(a recent appointment) finds him on familiar
plating. .
Beattie got his Cross in an exploit which
deprived the Germans of the only dock on the
Atlantic seaboard capable of taking the Tirpitz.
It was towards the great dock at St. Nazaire
that Bismarck was heading when the British
Home Fleet altered her destination; if Tirpitz
replaced her in the Atlantic she would,
assuredly, have to make use of the same dock.
The Royal Navy decided on a policy of denial.
On the night of March 28, 1942, a small
British force, comprising old destroyer
Campbeltown, a .brace of Hunt-class destroyers
and a few fast motor-torpedo-boats and gun-
boats, sneaked for the Loire, some six miles
up which lay the dock, stoppered by an enor-
mous steel caisson.
Campbeltown’s captain, Lt.-Commander
Beattie, had been about to go on leave when a
phone message from Admiralty ordered him
to Devonport.
“The idea was simply to ram Campbeltown
against the caisson. I’d had no experience of
ramming—luckily—and those who had were a
bit chary of talking about it. However, 1
estimated that at 20 knots the bow would
buckle back far enough to place our cargo nicely
against the caisson.”
Completely darkened, in every barrel a shell
and in every stomach curling tension, the little
force crept for the mouth of the Loire. At
12.45 a.m. the north shoreline of the estuary
was sighted. Speed was reduced. The little
craft crept on; the night fell wide and dense
on all sides. Except where, to port, the black
curtain was slashed .by vivid blue, green and
white tracer welcoming the diversionary R.A.F.
bombers. It was a comforting fireworks display.
Then, without warning, from the bulking
bank ahead, an Aldis lamp flashed a peremptory
challenge. A gunboat answered. Unconvincingly.
The next moment a great eye of light opened
and searched the silvered wave-tops. Others
followed. The whole estuary, with its bow-
waved intruders, was outlined in hard, revealing
brilliance. Then the basin erupted into flashes
and rocked with sound.
Discovered, Beattie increased to 20 knots.
Campbeltown tore up-river, the target for every-
thing on both banks which would bear, her
own guns flaring in spirited reply. The destroyer
quivered, continuously, with the vicious upthrust
of bursting steel.
“But, land-gunners, y’ know” —a deprecatory
wave of the four-ringed sleeve —“they under-
estimated our speed. Most of the stuff landed
aft, clear of the charges forrard. Though the
bridge took one now and then.”
A mile to go. Campbeltown’s superstructure
was pretty well razed. But her stokers kept at
their boilers, and her forrard 12-pounder,
manned splendidly by cooks and stewards,
spouted valiantly at the blaze of flashes ahead
and on both sides. Crouched where they could,
the 70-odd commandos she carried waited.
Meantime the supporting gunboats, flat-out
at nearly 20 knots, scurried round Campbel-
town, “in rapid, independent,” making a very
good job of confusing the enemy gunners,
adding their stabbing quota to the vicious lace-
work of tracer criss-crossing the torn river.
It had been arranged that Campbeltown
should strike the caisson at 1.30. At 20 knots,
with a flood-tide of close on two knots to
help her, she struck. “There was a hell of a
crash.” Time was 1.34. Never has a British


destroyer been four minutes late for a
rendezvous with such glorious and devastating
effect. , , „ -.i-h h ac k like silver-

11 a.m., Beattie saw no point in hiding his
identity,’ and revealed it, to be met with the
faultless-English reproach: “But what an
Sn°a^old T &er.” amaBe hUge
While Beattie was listening to this typically
Teutonic assessment of his effort some 40
senior German officers, including the officer-
commanding in the area, were aboard or round
the crippled destroyer rammed in the dock-gate,
devising means to haul her out. Close on 400
other officers and men were likewise clustered
in the vicinity, sightseeing the Englanders’ folly.
While they watched, marvelhng at the apparent
fruitlessness of the operation, the acid was
quietly completing its work. Shortly after
11 a.m. the fuses acted. Close on four tons
of amatol expended its giant strength in a
rupturing blast that blew the caisson clear oft
its sill and into the dock, exposing the vast
cavity completely to the sea. And 440 sight-
seers to a better life. Campbeltown had dis-
charged her final duty faithfully, forcefully and
The Germans were not lacking in imagination,
anyway, as regards the bravery of the man who
had conned her up those deadly miles. While
in a p.-0.-w. camp between Bremen and Ham-
burg the commandant “cleared lower-deck” and
read out Beattie’s V.C. citation.
As well as for his stokers (“a splendid
bunch”), Beattie has a word for the French in
the area. As the commandos got to work, and
explosion followed explosion across the basin,
the French workers thought the Second Front
had come. They acted accordingly, to the effect
that fighting and confusion reigned for upwards
sf. »Sire ayS rOUnd
Before the war Beattie served in those re-
doubtable old contemptibles Vendetta, Voyager
and Waterhen; so that his choice as leader of
Australia s anti-submarine frigate-squadron is
a happy one. And not less so because of the
anti-submarine experience, culled from War II
sailings in the Mediterranean and on east-
coast convoys, he brings to an important arm
or our rsavy.
PLAIN ENGLISH
Mr. Menzies Abroad.
After an apparently successful series of
talks in Washington and New York, Mr.
Menzies is in London to carry those on
defence a stage further with Mr.
Churchill.
The defence talks embrace policy in the
Far East, policy in the Middle East, the
question of an Australian voice in both if
its forces are to be involved expressly
or implicitly, and help in rearming such
forces on the mutual-aid basis of, for
instance, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation, especially if members of
the presumptive Middle East Defence
Pact are to be, ipso facto, members or
associate members of N.A.T.O. The
situation broadens out from a starting-
point something like this:
The U.S.-Australian-N.Z. mutual defence
treaty, for mutual security in the Pacific
after restoration of full sovereignty to
Japan, requires a joint Pacific Council
to give to this pact visible life. The U.S.
Secretary of State’s announcement of
agreement on formation of this Pacific
Council marks this item off Mr. Menzies’s
list. Following upon it come the question
of provision by U.S. of modern combat
aircraft for the R.A.A.F. on a grant-
aid basis, and a request for early dis-
cussion on the Pacific Council to frame
joint policy on the future of Formosa,
and towards China generally, especially
as a reservoir of aggression by “volun-
teers” against Indo-China and Malaya.
Assistance in equipment of Australian
defence forces, actual and to be raised,
is necessary also if Australia is expected
by Britain or U.S.A., or both, to con-
tribute to the international forces defend-
ing the Suez Canal area under the pro-
posed new agreement with Egypt.
Greece and Turkey, members of the
Middle East defence group, are to be
admitted to N.A.T.O, or financed and
equipped for the purpose as though they
were admitted. Any commitment accepted
by Australia would have to be assisted
in the same fashion. And Australia
would likewise require some voice in
Middle East defence policy.
The question arises; How much can
Australia, with limited means of action,
undertake in such international commit-
ments? Mr. Menzies has repeatedly
declared that Australia is tackling three
big jobs at once —fighting inflation in
order to prepare for general develop-
ment, rearming along with her British
Commonwealth partners and her Ameri-
can treaty-partners to meet the Soviet
aggression, and endeavoring to expand her
food-production in accordance with
Anglo-American requests. He has said,
very properly, that we cannot do all these
things at once without help. The Aus-
tralian Government accepts as a prime
duty towards its allies the obligation to
increase production of foodstuffs.
From this two things follow; (1) The
need for money’s-worth in capital goods
to increase food-production ; (2) provision
of necessary war equipment in which Aus-
tralian home-production must inevitably
be limited. Hence dollar-loans and
grants-in-aid of military and air arma-
ments. It is reported that Mr. Menzies
has made satisfactory progress in these
directions and that, as to the first part,
150 million dollars —balance of his
original request for 250 million dollars
two years ago—will probably be provided
by the International Bank.
In London Mr, Menzies has to get
these arrangements interlocked with the
plans of the Imperial General Staff and to
find out whether Britain means to join
the U.S. Government in refusing to recog-
nise the Communist Government in
Peking. The U.S.-Australasian Pacific
pact has raised that detail to a degree of
some importance. He has also to get a
clearer picture of Middle East obligations.
His first London weekend was historic
for the signing of the contractual agree-
ments between the Western Powers and
Germany preparatory to a formal peace-
settlement.
Offices of "Profit."
If the Federal Government feels em-
barrassed about Speaker Cameron’s
opinion on the legal position of under-
secretaries it has only itself to blame.
The Bulletin raised the question months
ago, and the Speaker has always refused
to recognise their status, whether they
were paid or not, holding it as his opinion
that their offices might be unconstitutional
or invalid in another way.
The Nicholas Commission on salaries
reported:
Doubt has been raised as to whether
the seat of an under-secretary would not
be forfeited if he were to receive any
salary in addition to his Parliamentary
allowance.... Subject to the interpretation
of Section 44 of the Constitution, we
recommend that an under-secretary or an
assistant-Minister be paid an additional
salary of £5OO per year.
'Section 44 referred to deals with M.P.s
holding offices of profit under the Crown.
The Government has provided £5 ss. a
day travelling expenses for each of these
“assistants” —an arrangement which has
not been announced to Parliament.
Neither has the position of the new sub-
Ministers been regularised by statute.
British practice, which provides the
precedent for our own —remember that
the Constitution is a British Statute —
holds that a salary need not be attached
to an executive office to disqualify the
holder.
If the office is an executive, and at
any time has had emoluments attached
to it, or if regular fees are attached to
it in any shape or form, even if the person
concerned does not take them, it appears
to disqualify.
In fact, the only way in which a mem-
ber of the House of Commons may resign
his seat is to secure appointment as
bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds or
Northstead, which not only have no fees
or salary attached but which actually
have only a purely nominal existence.
How far the matter goes in modern
practice is shown by the case of an M.P.
who sat on a minor appeal board within
the Royal Ordnance Factory during the
war. Members met once a month. The
Government, on legal advice, was com-
pelled to pass an Act of Indemnity (which
the Australian Government could not do
because of the limits of the Constitution)
to validate his position, even though he
did not take the small monthly expense
allowance.
The matter should certainly be settled,
in view of the very serious consequences
which can flow from the unseating of a
member whose vote has helped to make
laws and whose past proceedings in the
House would shed their privilege if it
were found that he had been sitting
illegally from the beginning.
At the same time the Government
might investigate the question of its
rights to pay some other salaries which
do not seem to be protected by the Con-
stitution, and particularly whether it is
lawful to* give tax-free allowances to
members and to pay different allowances
for different electorates; also whether it is
legal to pay two allowances to members
—one frankly as salary and one as ex-
penses.
Dr. Burton on the Way.
Leaving for Peking with his delegates
bound for the “Peace in the Pacific Con-
ference,” Dr. J, W. Burton said that the
delegates were going away to “learn what
the organisers have to say.”
What has Dr. Burton himself had to
say? Last year, when the Persian
and Egyptian crises were at their
worst, he wrote to the “Canberra
Times” (October 17) saying that
“there is no case for the presence of
British troops on Egyptian soil, especially
in these days of growing independence.”
With that Moscow was in hearty accord.
He declared that it was a “meaningless
cliche” that “The Middle East is our life-
line,” and was therefore apparently in
favor of surrender of control of Suez
Canal. He supported the view that be-
cause “India, Pakistan and Ceylon don’t
get excited” about the Persian oil question
and the dangers from aggression we
should, as an Asian country, follow their
viewpoint and “pursue common policies
with them” ; that “logically acting with
Asian countries along with others,” we
should “follow a neutrality policy with
respect to any Middle East and European
situation even in the event of world war” ;
this especially seeing that we “have no
significant contribution to make in forces
or supplies in our present position.”
This article was published when both
Houses of Parliament were sitting, and it
was on the breakfast-table of every
member in Canberra. It was printed at
a time when Dr. Burton was himself in
Canberra and was having daily sessions
with the Opposition, which must have
been aware of what he had written.
Dr. Evatt should also have been aware
of Dr. Burton’s views expressed in
“A.1.M.” (“Australian Independent
Monthly”) in December last because his
own article attacking the Japanese Treaty
was printed on the opposite page of the
journal. In that Dr. Burton held—and
his article seemed to be corollary to Dr.
Evatt’s own —that the Japanese were being
rearmed by the United States and “egged
on to fight but to aggress North instead
of South,” that the peace-treaty with
Japan had been “forged as a war weapon
with which to attack the Asian continent,”
and that a deal was made “for breaking
with Commonwealth mediation in Korea
and leaving the question of Dutch New
Guinea unsettled to provide a possible
outlet for surplus Japanese population.”
It is unbelievable that the “Labor”
party and its leaders did not know and
had not discussed these views before Dr.
Burton was endorsed at the beginning of
April as official A.L.P. candidate for
Lowe Federal seat. Somebody should
challenge them specifically to say whether
this was or was not so.
Holt's New Bill.
Labor Minister Holt’s new arbitration
bill pleases neither industrial party. A
deduction that, therefore, the amendments
proposed must be the desirable com-
promise does not necessarily follow. Much
will depend on the Chief Judge himself.
Most serious flaw in the arbitration
structure is the habit of unions—regarded
as a right—of rejecting awards, or parts
of awards, which do not please them.
Employers must obey the court’s orders
without question; unions are not so
bound. That is the attitude. Mr. Holt
said again, in his speech on the bill, that
under this detailed system for concilia-
tion, arbitration and (now) a limited right
of appeal where there is objection to a
decision in original jurisdiction (under
the commissioners) “strikes should be
obsolete.”
There is, in truth, no “right to
strike” under this system in our increas-
ingly complex industrial economy. There
is a right to appeal to the court against
a grievance, but no right to strike. This
the unions will not admit. Some of the
most powerful unions—controlled as
pawns in their own game by Communist
executives —have even declared that they
do not recognise the court or its authority,
and aim at destroying both. The council
of the Miners’ Federation has said this
in so many words, and other Communist-
led unions—the A.E.U. is the latest —
have made clear that their policy is to
exclude themselves from the court’s
jurisdiction entirely if that suits them.
There is no remedy against such
political strikes save the operation of
punitive powers by the court, which, as
the Minister says, is to be avoided in a
system whose primary function is con-
ciliation and arbitration. The unions
naturally object, but wilful defiance of the
court by some unions has brought on this
measure to defend its authority.
Mr. Holt says the Government “believes
the court should be in a position to deal
with the whole wage”—the basic wage
and skilled margins. Yet the jurisdiction
of commissioners as to marginal wages
remains, with “limited right of appeal” —
a right which is likely, on the scheme
described, to be pretty generally used by
each side. It will not, however, be appeal
after decision in original jurisdiction so
much as reference by request from either
party during original hearing. In any
case, the Chief Judge can say whether
the commissioner’s decision shall be final.
The A.C.T.U. promptly registered ob-
jection to the bill because it provides
for even this limited right of appeal.
Yet the A.C.T.U. has been barracking for
appeal to the court from the Galvin
award, and even countenancing unions’
“direct action” because the court has
refused to hear an appeal as being beyond
its jurisdiction.
As for the 40-hour week and the
C-index as basic-wage fixer, the remedy
is left, as before, to what good sense the
parties themselves can generate for useful
action. Incidentally, the Chief Judge’s
conference to extract good sense (if any)
seems to have foundered without trace.
Duggan's Lament.
Mr. J. E. Duggan, the Deputy-Premier
of Queensland, is that rare personality
a pessimist in office. Normally “Labor”
men when drawing the Ministerial issue
of shekels see the world in rainbow colors
and smell the scent of the approaching
millennium all about them.
Nothing, however, is well with Mr.
Duggan’s Australia. He seems, indeed,
by his outlook to be qualified for the
presidency of a large bank or some other
doleful institution which deals in currency
other than rainbows.
Mr. Duggan has been abroad, and on
May 12, at Toowoomba (Queensland),
contrasted —as every traveller does —the
lot of peoples who go regularly to bed
hungry and who are to be seen “carrying
little baskets of soil to replace erosion”
with those of his own land:
In Australia people are doing as little
as they possibly can in their occupations,
doing all they can to catch the Government,
to filch something from somebody else.
There was a time when, before the war,
men and women would hesitate before
taking a packet of pins in a store. But
at the present time there are many who
would not hesitate to take a dozen pairs
of trousers and often get away with it
with impunity... .people will pilfer from
stores, pilfer from their employer, pilfer
time on the job and neglect the, obliga-
tions of facing up to reaUty. Farmers
don’t want to grow crops, men want to
work as little as possible, and everybody
wants to live for himself and not for
anyone else.
So he urges Australians to think not
as Liberals or “Labor” men or Jews or
Gentiles, but purely as good Australians
—voting, of course, without demur for
Mr. Duggan and his followers and accept-
ing gracefully the results of his State's
polls in electorates which during 30 years
of “Labor” rule have been so arranged
that “Labor” can never be defeated
except by an unimaginable swing. And.
of course, those who follow his advice
must not inquire too closely into the
ethical habits of the Government itself,
such as illegally selling tickets in its huge,
squafid lotteries in other States or into
the influences which have brought about
the immoral or amoral conditions which
Mr. Duggan so deeply deplores.
They should abstain from inquisitive-
ness on these matters in the interests of
Mr. Duggan’s comfort, since inquisition
might reveal how much the constant
preaching and example of “Labor” on
the virtues of leisure and the highest
squeezable wage have done most to
destroy the moral fibre of the average man,
who has been taught by State education
systems and from the political platform
that the employer and the capitalist are
greedy robbers wrongly holding what is
the rightful possession of the “toilers,”
to whom it is to be restored by Socialism ;
that gambling is something which the
State officially approves and carries on
and that hate is a normal weapon of the
class-war.
Any investigator in Queensland, the
land in which confiscation, repudiation,
suppression of private enterprise to save
bankrupt Socialist concerns, official
lotteries and the technique of establish-
ing a permanent dictator-Government
under a nominally democratic electoral
system, would find the origins of most
that Mr. Duggan deplores in the prin-
ciples established during the glorious
reigns of his political progenitors, Messrs.
T. J. Ryan and “Red Ted” Theodore.

Branches and Agents throughout the Commonwealth
twice in 40 years, also increases th<
tension between Russia and the West.
The Russians never have believec
that the “contract” (or treaty) could be
arranged. They have always had con-
fidence that at the last moment France’s
fears would get the better of her; bul
this danger was overcome by binding
guarantees given by Britain and the
United States. The contract, of course,
is subject to ratification by the Parlia-
ments of Britain, France and the U.S.,
and it will operate only when the scheme
for a European army has been agreed to
by Continental Parliaments.
On the eve of signature the Russians,
who have maintained a threatening
attitude given reality by heavy military
investment and rearming in Eastern
Germany behind their Iron Curtain,
issued a Note answering the suggestion
of the Western Allies for a four-Power
conference on an all-German peace and
free elections, Moscow objects to the
proposal that elections should be held
under U.N.O. supervision and proposes
elections under control of the four
occupying Powers operated through a
commission. But it is quite obvious that
the Russian Note is, as usual, mere
propaganda.
Having begun seriously to arm Eastern
Germany, in which there are more than
300,000 of Russian front-line troops apart
from auxiliaries, and having begun to
build a defence system in it very similar
to the Siegfried Line, Moscow’s Note
declares:—
The Bonn agreement makes unity more
remote and difficult because It binds
Western Germany by obligations, whereas
Bast Germany is free of any such commit-
ments and is developing under conditions
favorable to the unification of Germany
into a single democratic, peaceful State.
It is so peaceful and democratic that it
is like the Soviet Union —any citizen,
for instance, who wishes to visit Western
Germany or a foreign country can only
do so by “escaping” as from jail, as
hundreds do every month.
Four-Power control, of course, would
fail, and Russia knows it would. In the
past the Kremlin has seen to that.
The last time it was tried, on the basis
of the arrangements made at Potsdam, it
nearly ended in war and was at last
abandoned.
POLITICAL POINTS
Doc, Evatt’s comment that the result
of the Liverpool by-election for Mc-
Grrrrr’s old seat in the N. S. Wales
Assembly had a national significance was
correct in that the voting was an index
of the present unpopularity of the Federal
Government rather than of the popularity
of N. S. Wales “Labor.” At the last
general election McGrrrrr held the seat
by 12,381 votes to the Liberal Fitz-
patrick’s 6935. There was also a Com-
munist in the field; he collected 527
votes. On Saturday, in a straightout
fight the “Labor” candidate N. J, Mannix
scored 14,048 and Fitzpatrick 6374.
Thus the Liberal vote is down
600 and the “Labor” tally, in addition
to the Communist parcel, is up 1100. No-
thing that the N. S. Wales Government
has done in the past two years justifies
the increase in confidence indicated by
the improved figures, but it seems likely
that the concerted howls of Cahill and
company, aimed at branding Menzies
and Fadden as villains scheming to rob
N. S, Wales of its birthright, have had
some effect.
With a precarious majority of one—
and a temperamental one at that —N. S.
Wales “Labor” has found it expedient
to spend most of the time since the 1950
election in recess, and it is in that blissful
haven at present. The Liverpool gains
are spurring the more hopeful of the
party to press for an early election before
the wicked-Federal-Government yam
becomes too threadbare. Probably
Cahill will wait a little longer. There’ll
be another by-election on June 28—
Ashfield, vacant since Athol Richardson
became a judge.
N. J. Mannix, the new member, is a
former private-secretary to ex-Premier
McGrrrrr. His ex-boss is reported to have
taken an active part in his campaign.
As a citizen the chairman of the Mari-
time Services Board is entitled to his
political opinions, but as a rule the holder
of such a post refrains from active
partisanship.
Attempts were made at the annual
conference of the N. S. Wales Country
party to carry a motion urging the aboli-
tion of the provisional-tax system as far as
primary producers are concerned, but
after party-leader Bruxner had spoken
strongly against the motion it was
defeated. He told delegates that under
the plan about to be introduced they
would still be “miles ahead of salary and
wage-earners,” who paid their tax week
by week:
The trouble is that a lot of people have
been carried away by propaganda and
statements that are not correct.
That remark could be applied with equal
truth to most of the Government’s
financial policy.
The same conference criticised the
Commonwealth Government for not
taking action to prevent the nationalisa-
tion of industry. While commodity-con-
trol boards (almost all originally created
by State Governments in which C.P. men
shared) continue, the menace of nationali-
sation exists —in fact, it does exist so
far as the producers of the controlled
commodities are concerned. Will the
Country party support abolition of the
potato, milk, egg, honey, banana and
canary-seed boards?
Ward has returned to the charge regard-
ing the David Jones letter-of-credit. He
still wants an inquiry and should be given
it, but upon terms decided by Parliament,
which can instruct him to give evidence
and reveal the name of the person who
he says gave him information from
departmental letters. Then, if he pro-
duces anybody who has broken the law
that person should be dealt with in a
proper way and Ward along with him. It
is surely time that Parliament became
tired of his habit of acting as self-
confessed accomplice and protector of
persons who filch documents or informa-
tion from official files to discredit the
Government which employs them. He
has boasted before of being kept fully
informed of what goes on inside certain
Government departments.
While the controversy about the status
of Parliamentary under-secretaries at
Canberra was being salted with the plea
that their appointment was imperative
to relieve wilting Ministers of their un-
bearable burden of detail, the where-
abouts of the Unlucky Three was as
follows;
Mr. J. Howse left on Tuesday for a
four-months’ trip to Europe.
Mr. Hamilton was reported holidaying
in Darwin after an operation.
Mr. Swartz, the newest appointee, was
engaged in military duties at Puckapunyal
which will occupy him for the next three
weeks.
As Queensland “Courier-Mail” put it;
Troops Fly With Peking Men. Perhaps
the people referred to are fossils, but it’s
a safe bet the original Peking Man
wouldn’t want to be seen dead with them.
In Hong Kong Dr. Burton told reporters
he and the rest of the delegation were
“seeking peace and pursuing it.” Red
China, at present engaged in aggressive
war in Korea, seems a strange place in
which to seek peace. As to the pursuit,
in what direction does the delegation in-
tend to pursue it if it gets away from
them in Peking?
Latest “non-Communist” to arrive in
Peking for the so-called peace conference
is the Red Dean; it only remains for
Jessie Street to turn up and the happy
family will be all complete.
Long-service leave, in the general con-
ception of the term, is leave given in
recognition of continuous service with
one employer over a considerable number
of years, usually 20. How it can be
applied at all to casual employment
baffles the understanding of ordinary citi-
zens. But not the Brisbane Trades and
Labor Council. The mathematicians of
that body have been on the job and have
evolved a proposition which is to be put
to the State Industrial Court. Their plan
is that casual and seasonal workers shall
be entitled to long-service leave on the
basis of 6.24 minutes for each day
worked.
If this claim is admitted it will be in-
teresting to see how long it is before
long-service leave is granted to casual
bookies’ clerks, who have just lodged an
application for a minimum of £4 10s.
for a Saturday afternoon’s pencilling.
After that it will probably be the casual
punter’s turn.
London “Daily Mirror” has published
an apology to Prime Minister Churchill
and has agreed to pay his costs and make
a contribution to charity in settlement of
his libel action arising out of an article
published at the time of the general elec-
tion. The paper’s front-page on polling-
day carried a picture of a hand holding
a revolver, with a finger on the trigger.
Below it were photos of Churchill and
Attlee, with the caption “Whose Finger?”
The published apology says, among other
things, that the defendants wish to make
it clear that they had no intention of
suggesting that Mr. Churchill did not dis-
like the possibility of war as much as
they did themselves. It now remains for
Herbert Morrison to say that he was only
joking when he called Winnie a war-
monger.
Memories of the man who called the
cook a thingummy were roused by a case
in the Arbitration Court in which a
ship’s fireman sought an order compelling
the Seamen’s Union to restore his mem-
bership privileges. The fireman’s story
was that at the time of the Communist
referendum last year, while employed on
the inter-State steamer Balarr, he had an
argument on the subject with the cook.
The cook had hit him and he had hit
the cook. As a sequel he had been told
that the management committee of the
union had suspended him indefinitely and
had advised him to seek other employ-
ment. The court granted him the order,
with costs against the union. N. S. Wales
Attorney-General Clarrie Martin appeared
for the fireman; F. W. Paterson, former
Communist M.L.A. in Queensland, for
the union.
The annual conference of the N. S.
Wales A.L.P. branch will be held in
Sydney the weekend after next —as usual
behind closed doors. This is a pity, in
view of the alleged emptiness of the
A.L.P. exchequer. With the Ferguson
appointment. Dr. Burton’s nomination,
the industrial-groups and the date of the
State election coming up for discussion,
seats would be rushed at a guinea a time.
Anyway, somebody should make a fortune
selling bandages and sticking-plaster out-
side the door.
W. A. Coghlan, a spokesman for the
tractor trade, told Brisbane reporters that
the trade imports about £3O-million-worth
of tractors a year, but is not worried by
import-cut legislation. The statement got
nothing like the publicity it would have
if Mr, Coghlan said his people were
worried
The news of the collision between the
American carrier Wasp and destroyer
Hobson was hardly cold when the U.S.
Navy announced that Wasp was back in
full commission. A new bow was cut
from a sister-carrier in mothballs and
riveted in place of Wasp’s 75ft. of
crumpled nose. The job took a New
Jersey shipyard 10 days—claimed to be
the world’s fastest major ship-repair job.
There is not likely to be a challenge from
Cockatoo or Williamstown —time there,
even for destroyers, is measured in years.
Forgetting for the moment its dismal
prophecies of ruin and unemployment as
a result of the Federal Government’s
financial policy, the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment is considering increasing the first
prize in its Special Blottery from £12,000
to £lB,OOO, at the same time jumping the
price of tickets up to 15s. The argument
is that the move will bring in more dough
and that the public will line up for the
15s. tickets just as readily as for the
ten-bobbers. P’raps they will, but the
proposal makes “Labor’s” pretended
fears of an unemployment pool sound
rather hollow. Or is it just that, come
boom, come slump, “Labor” loves
lotteries?
Dubbo (N.S.W.) show society put a
shearing contest on its programme, and
naturally chose the Saturday for it, as that
would be the day when the biggest crowd
would attend. Then it was discovered
that the idea was in conflict with the
shearing-award, which bans shearing on a
Saturday, and the contest was abandoned.
Sydney R.A.S. had better check up on
the woodchoppers’-award.
Natural-increase and migration ran
neck-and-neck in contributing to the
growth of Australia’s population during
1951 ; the figures were 111,512 and
111,433 respectively. Total population at
December 31 was 8,538,736.
Bert: There’s a lot of difference be-
tween being a brilliant lawyer and political
opportunist and being the successful
leader of a party.
From Molongloside;
“S. M. Herald’s’’ Conberra correspondent
says that “Mr. Speaker’s new bombshell may
prove his last His startling views on the
constitutional position of under-secretaries are
highly embarrassing to the Government, and
may finally persuade Government members to
take active steps to obtain a new Speaker.”
It seems a novel proposition that because a
Speaker utters an impartial opinion embarrass-
ing to a Government it should throw him out.
When that precedent is introduced Parliament
may as well close its doors. It is only one step
from expelling private members who express
opinions embarrassing to the Government.
In any case the “S. M. Herald” should reflect
that so far both Mr. Cameron and the presi-
dent of the Senate have been ultimately vic-
torious in everything they have tackled. Their
measures to curtail privileges of the Press and
civil servants at the expense of the public
purse have been approved by the Joint House
Committee. The “Herald” itself agrees now
that some private members believe that when
he restricted Press privileges within the House
“the Press had what was coming to them,”
and that in his “campaign to clean up the
House he won more admiration than blame....
there was not much regret at the passing of
poker-playing and s.-p.-betting from Parliament
House.” Yet “S.M.H.” at the time of the
“clean-up” held, with others, that gambling
in the House was limited to penny-poker in
private rooms and that a “clean-up” was an
act of tyranny. Even the Opposition has come
to approve the Speaker’s private attitude of
aloofness from the Governor-General.

totalled £118.7 million, compared
with an estimate of £lB2 million
for the year. At April’s rate of
spending the defence bill for the
year (subject to any year-end
adjustments) will be in the
vicinity of £l5O million, or more
than £3O million below estimates.
It is interesting to note that
out of an estimated Budget ex-
penditure of £941 million for
the year the Federal depart-
mental vote amounts to £4O
million. (That is apart from
business undertakings, such as
the post-office, Commonwealth
railways, broadcasting, etc.) By
far the greatest civilian charge
on Commonwealth revenue to-
day is the cost of social security
—pensions, child endowment,
free medicine, etc. The States
also take a huge whack, and
the interest bill runs into close
on £7O million a year.
The Governments at the
present time are faced with a
contracting base for the collec-
tion of revenue. There has been
a great slump in wool income,
and the taxable profit from wool
will drop in a greater degree ;
so will the taxation rate. After
close on a year of low wool
prices there is now a tendency
for values to recover ; whether
this will continue into the new
selling season starting next Sep-
tember or thereabouts remains
to be seen.
Treasurer Fadden proposes to
bring down his Budget early in
respect of next year. Some time
in July has been mentioned. It
promises to be a difficult job,
this estimating of income and
outgo for the financial year
1952-53. Professor Bland,
M.P., said in the Representa-
tives last week that “if we are
committed to another £ 1000-
million Budget next year, then it
National Money Problems
The statement by the Federal
Treasurer that the estimated
Budget surplus of £114.5 million
would not be realised is sup-
ported by Treasury figures up to
April 30. With two months of
the financial year to go only
about 53 per cent, of the esti-
mated income tax had been col-
lected, and, though heavy collec-
tions are usually made in the
months of May and June, it
appears that much of the tax due
from the rural areas will be held
in abeyance in view of the fall
in wool prices and the hard
season experienced in some
States, more particularly Queens-
land.
Actual figures for the 10
months showed income-tax col-
lections of £297 million, with
£265 million still to come in. In
Sir Arthur Fadden’s opinion, col-
lections will be “appreciably
lower” than this estimated out-
standing amount. Also, payroll-
tax and sales-tax collections will
be less than forecast, while
Customs and excise revenue will
be up. And post-office revenue
will be very much below esti-
mates, largely because there has
been a falling-off in the use of
postal facilities, principally tele-
phonic and telegraphic, since
prices were increased some
months ago.
The deferment of 40 p.c. of
1951-52 provisional taxation in
the case of woolgrowers (allowed
because of the fall in wool
prices) would cost the estimates
about £5O million, Treasurer
Fadden said last week.
Whilst revenue, on the whole,
threatens to be down, some forms
of expenditure are also below
estimates. The item that stands
out in this regard is defence: up
to the end of April outlay
means that there will be no
possible reduction in taxation.
It means that sources which we
were able to use last year but
which have now dried up will
not be available to us this
year.” Bland foresaw the
possibility of even heavier taxa-
tion for 1952-53.
Certainly if it is intended to
go on under full sail yyith recent
expenditure plannings the next
financial year promises to be one
of considerable stringency—pro-
"Are you the bloke who advertised for an aggressive
salesman ?”
vided the price of wool does
not recover substantially. We
are now beginning to feel the in-
fluence of our low productivity
in its effect on real income and
real saving, as well as upon the
costs structure. The drop in im-
port income, which for a while
tended to disguise our problem,
has revealed the deficiency in all
its starkness.
Australia is finding out—the
hard way—that the 40-hour
week, as worked, is standing in
the way of all our major
economic and industrial objec-
tives. This country will soon
have to learn, also, that there is
no half-way house between
Socialism and Capitalism. In
Australia at present we have a
parasitic sort of Socialism suck-
ing the life out of Capitalism,
which as a result is in grave
danger of falling completely
down on its job of producing the
nation’s essentials. And Social-
ism has nothing to offer in their
place.
Rura! Relief
The relaxing of some restric-
tions on bank credit last week
had mostly to do with the acqui-
sition of rural properties, house-
purchase, and the provision of
working capital for business and
industry. For the purchase of a
rural property, or additional
properties, up to £15,000 may be
advanced. Up to £3500 may be
lent for the erection or purchase
of a house, with “reasonable
accommodation” in excess of
this provided it is repaid within
six months of date of occupa-
tion. Advances with time-limits
may be made for the purchase
or taking-up of shares or for
subscription to Commonwealth
loans.
In regard to rural taxation,
Treasurer Fadden brought down
a tax-amendment bill into the
Representatives. Introducing it,
Fadden said that the Government
had decided in March to grant
woolgrowers whose income in
1952 had declined from 1951
levels the right to defer up to
40 p.c. of the 1951-52 provisional
tax payable. That decision had
already been put into effect, and
the new bill validated these defer-
ments. The amount of the
1951-52 revenue which would be
foregone would be about £5O
million.
A woolgrower would be en-
titled to defer up to 40 p.c. of
the 1951-52 provisional tax
payable by him so long as he
sent to the Taxation Department
an estimate of his 1951-52 tax-
able income, and so long as the
amount deferred was justified by
that estimate.
In future, all taxpayers would
be given the right of assessing
their own provisional tax, sub-
ject to departmental approval,
and a margin of error of 20 p.c.
would be allowed ; they might
be charged a penalty if the error
was more than that.
Referring to an article in B.
14/5/’52, a correspondent has
pointed out that no taxpayer,
pastoralist or otherwise, pays
more than 16s. 6d. in the £ in
taxation. That is so ; but many
pastoralists recently have re-
ceived assessments considerably
in excess of their total income
for 1950-51 simply because the
provisional tax paid in that year
was based on a lower (previous
year’s) price of wool. This year’s
income is more or less back to
that lower price, but provisional
tax for 1951-52 as well as actual
tax for 1950-51 is based on
1950-51 income. Hence the
present 40 p.c. deferment per-
mitted in certain cases by the
department.

325. 6d. The co. not long ago
announced a 1\ p.c. div., which
compares with a previous dis-
tribution of 5| p.c. The div.
received by Linoleum Holdings
from its shares in Michael
Navin and Co. (Aust.) Pty., Ltd.,
the operating co., was 8 p.c.,
compared with a previous 6 p.c.
The operating co.’s figures are
not disclosed, but it is under-
stood to be doing very well,
even though turnover has been
affected by the recent general
setback to trade. Shortage of
hessian has stopped the manu-
facture of printed linoleum, but
a limited quantity of felt-base
lino, is being produced with the
help of the Scottish parent.
Linoleum Holdings’ shares look
attractive as a lock-up—if they
can be got.

surplus wools is being wound
un, with chairman Harry
Shackleton as liquidator. When
it was set up in 1946 it was
reckoned it would take 10 years
to clear the war-time surplus, but
the carryover of 17,800 bales
from 1950-51 —all that was left
of the 10| million bales it began
with —has been sold. Total
profits from the sales, with some
war-time profits, reached

World travellers start off on the right foot
Every year, the “Wales” gives thousands
of travellers specialized free travel service. So
I arranged for the Bank’s travel department to
book my customer’s passages and make their
hotel reservations. I also supplied them with
a circular letter of credit and travellers’ cheques.
These will save them the risk of carrying too
much money in cash. Wherever you go, you,

From Herbert Holman
The Government has sus-
tained another body-blow in the
sweeping Labor gains at the local
elections. When all explana-
tions and excuses are made, a
net gain of 641 seats in the
boroughs alone is not easily to
be discounted. The total vote
of just under 50 per cent, is high,
even when compared with the 83
per cent, of the last general
election. Particularly significant
is the inroad the Socialists have
made into Tory strongholds.
1 ogether, these two circum-
stances suggest that confirmed
but inactive Tories have stayed
away, while the “don’t-knows,”
inflamed by relentless mouth-to-
mouth propaganda, have regis-
tered their resentment against
the Government’s declared in-
tention to be unpopular when
necessary.
There’s no doubt that the in-
censed voters have been both
unreasonable and unfair, since
the cause of much of their dis-
satisfaction was due to the hang-
over from the Attlee Govern-
ment. There’s also no doubt
that, were Abe Lincoln alive to-
day, he’d modify that dictum
about not fooling the people,
for too many of them are, in the
stress of deliberately-provoked
emotion, repudiating a good
chance of national survival.
The Conservative party has
been forced to recognise, some-
what late in the day, the effec-
tiveness of the closely-knit, un-
swerving Socialist propaganda
machine ; the more so since Mr.
Morrison, after his ineffectual
faltering as Foreign Secretary, is
once more on top of his job in
the very antithesis of statesman-
ship working-up ungentle
passions against the Tones.
Electoral Bribery
This propaganda is not only
conducted by whispers from
door-to-door, in the local “co-
ops,” fish-and-chip shops and
factory canteens. Its powerful
seeds are sown ostentatiously at
high level. To wit:
(1) Mr. Strauss’s threat in the
House of Commons that a new L>abor
Government would re-scramble the
unscrambled steel - nationalisation
and offer poor terms of compensa-
tion to shareholders.
(2) Mr. Morrison’s comparable
threat to potential investors fn
private road-haulage.
(3) Mr. Bobens's statement, later
reiterated in the Lords, that a Labor
Government would free the Health
Service of any part-payment by the
“insured.”
The first two instances, apart
from the narrow party advan-
tage of packing a pistol, are
hardly conducive to stability in
the industries concerned ; and the
third is no more than a squalid
device, particularly as Mr.
Robens belongs to those who,
when in power, had to admit to
the need for a “ceiling” on the
soaring Health Service costs. i
In the House of Commons,
the Opposition has been surpris-
ingly quiet. This may be the
lull before a great offensive
against the intended modifica-
tions to steel and transport. Mr.
Bevan, of whom much knight-
errantry was expected, has tem-
porarily faded out of the lists.
Maybe he realises that he can sit
pretty, since his characteristic
leadership is not required. In-
deed, everything seems to be
coming his way. Even some of
the trade-union bosses, who dis-
like and distrust him, have to
admit that their path, if not coin-
cident, is a close parallel to his.
And, with the conferences
coming, Mr. Attlee has all the
freedom of movement of a man
in a wind-tunnel.
And Now—Daltonism
Recent developments have
proved that the traditional agree-
ment between Government and
Opposition over foreign policy
is as brittle a facade as that
which covers up the disunity
within the Labor party. Such is
the arrogant momentum of a
“movement” from the Left that
what started with a disagree-
ment with the moderates over
part-payment for dentures has
now engulfed foreign policy.
Here it is the self-assured jack-
in-the-box, Mr. Dalton, who has
burst out as an upper-class
Bevan, seeking to undo the pains-
taking work that has gone to-
wards the integration of Europe
west of the Curtain.
By contrast, Mr. Eden’s voice
is little heard. He presumably
is busy conciliating, patching-up
and constructively working for
peace. Whatever the short-
comings of Mr. Churchill’s Gov-
ernment —and there is plenty of
criticism, both from responsible
observers and from Tories them-
selves —there can be no dispute
about the proper course it should
take.
Between Friends
Australian culture here in
London is nothing if not asser-
tive. The music association is in
modest but active being, drama
is ready and there is news of a
third society, this time of artists.
Now a naturalised Australian,
Hans-Hubert Schoenzeler, who
has studied music for 20 of his
26 years, latterly at the Sydney
Conservatorium, has founded a
Dominion Orchestra. This small
string ensemble was very well re-
ceived at its first concert, held
recently in the hall of the Royal
Empire Society.
Programme-building for occa-
sions such as these is always
difficult, since the audience sub-
stantially comes to encourage
and be entertained rather than
to tease its brain with problems
of musical intellectualism. On
the other hand, composers and
executants, while deservedly
seeking, to show what they are
capable of, tend towards
academic virtuosity. The result
is that chamber music, which has
been well-defined as “music
among friends,” can all too
readily convert those friends
who are merely listening into
bewildered but polite estrange-
ment ; and the more so when
under-rehearsal and a less than
first-class technique combine to
roughen the edges. At the other
extreme, the “Viennese Night”
in pier-pavilion fashion is as un-
rewarding to the artists as it is
patronising to the audience.
Mr. Schoenzeler struck a good
balance without stooping to con-
densation ; the more tuneful
items were not hackneyed. He
is a bold and musicianly con-
ductor with a keen sense of
style. Quite undeterred by the
circumstances —his ensemble was
necessarily somewhat patchy—
he acted as if it had the unity
and understanding of long and
close association, often with in-
spiring result. A too-uniform
tone and some faltering in the
quieter, slow movements were
noticeable, and concertante
failed to come to terms with
ripieno in the Vivaldi “Concerto
Grosso,” but the tuttis were
warm and lively.
The inclusion of a strident and
recondite first performance was
unfortunate, but the faint praise
of polite applause was quickly
turned to advantage by a well-
known Haydn serenade.
It was unfortunate that one
of the orchestra’s aims—to pre-
sent a new work by a Common-
wealth composer—was defeated
by the sickness of the South
African mezzo-soprano who was
to have performed a group of
songs by a New Zealand com-
poser, But an Australian bari-
tone stepped in at short notice.
The artists were one-third Aus-
tralian, the remainder represent-
ing Canada, South Africa,
Jamaica and that other, often-
neglected Dominion, Great
Britain.


Society
“Mac Hoots”; In Taylor - square,
Darlinghurst; Saturday afternoon, when
every Sydney motorist, having consumed
his midday beer, hurtles pellmell for the
races or the football, led by stampeding
herds of taxi-drivers. There strolled
across Taylor-square in the sunshine a
young man pleasantly preoccupied in
eating potato-chips from a paper-bag.
Emerging, as by a miracle, from under
the front-wheel of the utility ahead of
me (which had just committed three
successive breaches of the traffic-laws in
the space of 200 yards) the young man
loudly told the driver to pull his head in.
The driver roared back at him. The
young man, exasperated beyond measure,
hurled his paper-bag of potato-chips at
the utility and strode on. The driver,
stopping in the middle of the road, leapt
out, chased after him, and socked him on
the jaw; and there in the middle of
Taylor-square they fought very prettily,
to the great delight of all. Moral: You
never know what will happen when you
stroll in the sunshine eating potato-chips
in Sydney on a Saturday afternoon.

“Jasby”: I wonder what simile they
use in Norway to describe a tram jam-
packed with passengers. In this country
we used to say “packed like sardines,”
and no one could deny that the fishy
contents of the tins that were the main
export of Scandinavia were packed to a
degree of tightness that was the envy of
theatre-managers and transport depart-
ments alike. The phrase no longer has
any meaning. Last week I opened a tin
of sardines —not the smallest size, either.
It contained five sardines and enough
spare space for them to practise forma-
tion swimming in the oil. If that is any
indication of how full the Oslo trams
are nowadays, then that city’s tramway
system must be even closer to bankruptcy
than the Sydney rattletraps.
* * * *
“Bo”: It doesn’t surprise me in the
least that the Rockefeller Foundation’s
staff of 200 doctors, nurses and helpers
have despairingly withdrawn from the
five Egyptian villages in which for three
years they have conducted a ceaseless but
futile battle, using tons of D.D.T., chlor-
dane and gammexane, against the house-
fly. The expedition estimated that at the
close of their long campaign the fly popu-
lation was back again to its original
density of 100 to the square yard after
suffering only a temporary setback. If
the fly population in that land of wells,
yells and smells can now muster only
that density they must have suffered heavy
mortality since I was there. Our tent at
Heliopolis couldn’t have been five square
yards in area, yet the fly population in it
never fell below 5000, with a cloud of
several thousand always just outside the
flap battling to get in, One of our staple
items of diet was fig-jam, which the Army
supplied in 71b. tins. Immediately they’d
hear the sound of a tin-opener being used
the whole fly population right out to the
Sphinx would make a fly-line to our
mess-hut and by the time the lid was
open they’d be stacked 2ft. deep
above it. In the end we had to eat the
flies with the jam; to extricate ’em from
their indistinguishable surroundings either
in the tin or on the dodger was quite
hopeless. I have a theory that the inter-
vening heavy fly mortality has been
caused by the flies constantly settling in
the eyes of the Gyppos.
* * * •
“H.C.8.”: At regular periods a truck
drives around our locality carrying two
or three youths who, with an accuracy
unsurpassed by the local newspaper-
deliverer, fling rolled brown-paper bags
into every house. A printed form
attached to each bag requests that the
receiver place any old rags or worn-out
clothes inside and leave the offering near
the front-door. Another truck delivers a
similar bag to be filled with waste-paper.
My spouse received one of the rag-
containers, filled it, and parked it on the
front-porch as requested. That night I
fell over it. Three nights later I fell over
it again. Falling over the thing became
a habit. My howls of protest met a stock
answer: “Well, the form says to leave it
there ; if I bring it inside the chap may
come when I’m out.” A fortnight later
I came home late and didn’t fall over the
bulged bag—mainly because it wasn’t
there. No, the rag-collector hadn’t called.
Fed-up with seeing the thing about, my
wife had bunged the rags back and put
the bag in the waste-paper bag. Three
days later the “rag” truck came around
again—delivering more fodder for the
waste-paper truck.
* * * *
“Cobalt”: Signs of the times! I
phoned a Sydney pictureframer (not the
leading firm) and asked the girl if she
could make sure that two watercolors
“ Confess , Cynthia—is this the man you met in the country last year?”
which were to be framed for sending-in
day of the Watercolor Institute would be
ready on time. “Well,” she said, we ve
instructed the factory that they’re to be
ready by that date, but I’m afraid you 11
have to ring up again the day before
they’re due, to see if the factory has sent
them,” I asked, couldn’t she remind the
factory to have them done on time, other-
wise they’d miss the show. “Oh,” she
said, “I don’t think so. The factory gets
“How much Would you charge to saw up a load of firewood?”
very annoyed if we remind them.” And
I daresay the factory does —what a long
time it is since the customer dared get
annoyed if work wasn’t done on time.

“Gulliver”; An Australian weapon-
test flopped (B. 14/5/’52) at Pittwater,
N. S. Wales, towards the end of World
War 11. An aircraft was to drop an
Australian-made torpedo so that it would
explode spectacularly against a rocky
headland. Many small craft, packed to
the gunwales with brass of unparalleled
magnificence and departmental officials
all above black-Homburg rank, floated
well back from the point where the
torpedo was to enter the water ; the plane
came in right on the line, but much too
high ; the infernal machine hit the water,
bounced, turned right over, and headed
at full-speed towards the semicircle of
boats. Though he will not swear to it,
my informant, who was circling the scene
in a Catalina, says there were Admirals
paddling with their hands overside, and
Heads-of-Rooms tearing up floorboards
to do likewise ; anchors jerked upwards,
wheels and tillers went hard over, and
anything that looked like a starter-buttoa
took an awful bashing. Luckily the fleet
parted in time and the home-made
menace ran itself out and sank. The
sole sufferer was the Marine posted with
fixed bayonet in a dinghy above the
carcass; the recovery-party found him
next day flaked out and fast asleep on
the floor-boards, and upon him was
visited the accumulated wrath of that
talented gathering of buck-passers.
Girls of a family of my
acquaintance visiting their mother’s grave
found three vases they regularly fill with
flowers transferred to a stone-bordered
but unnamed grave some distance away,
and filled with Mother’s-Day flowers . . .
Morals and sentiment don’t always go
together.
* % * *
“Sackville”: I apologise for many past
jeers at such weather-reports as “Mainly
fine with intermittent showers and more
rain” and “Variable winds from mild to
strong, reaching gale force at times.”
In Sydney’s maze of man-made gullies all
those things could be happening at once
within two blocks of one another. During
a recent visit to the Big Noise I stood
on a Market-street corner facing Quay-
wards and saw a flag on a tall Barrack-
street building straining to a westerly
while less than a hundred yards away
another flag flew in exactly the opposite
direction; I saw men wearing overcoats
and gloves at 11 a.m. while City Council
employees in the next street were stripped
to the buff. But for real vagaries of
temperature I handed the palm to Rail-
way-square: in a jeweller’s window an
ornamental barometer-thermometer gave
the temperature as 34 degrees, while an-
other, nine inches away, was enjoying the
comparatively mild climate of 56.
* * * *
“Bass”: A Perth daily described
Tapestry’s Moonee Valley win: “He
took a run on the rails three furlongs
from home and then made haste for the
p05t....” Reading it, I could hear those
Victorian punters howling, “Make haste!
Make haste!”
* * * *
“Uramao”: Now Bung’s on the mat in
New Zealand ; a licensing commission is
perambulating the country. A North
Island Bung was warned by the local
magistrate presiding over the licensing
commission that he must make alterations
or lose his licence. Bung got busy ; then
he was hailed before the same magis-
trate in the Magistrate’s Court, on charges
of breaking building-control regulations.
* * * *
“Cauboy”: Can’t agree with actor
Donald Wolfit, who questions the tact
and discretion of the Old Vic. Com-
pany in taking “Othello” as one of the
productions to be presented in its tour of
Africa, a continent distracted by the
color question. Evidently Mr. Wolfit
thinks that Shakspeare was taking sides in
“Othello” and that his play was a bit ot
propaganda for a White England. I
don’t think that any such idea ever entered
the bard’s head. He just took the story
as he found it in The Hecatomithi or
G. B. Giraldi Cinthio, plus a few details
from the story in an ampler version, put
into it his humanity and great under-
standing of human nature and made the
yarn live. He was an artist, not mere
propagandist like those fashionable Leftist
writers who write plays from Joe Stalin’s
standpoint and call ’em literature.
A VISITATION.
0 what can ail thee, wretched wight,
So pale by day, so wan by night?
The answer is, I’ve got the . . . Gripes,
One must not speak like common types!
The proper phrase, to the polite, is
“A case of gastro-enteritis”;
So, this week, no extravaganza
Involved of phrase, prolix of stanza
Which one can hardly leave half-way
And come back knowing what to say,
But couplets, short and sharp and neat
That quickly end, and are complete.
One moment, please. X must begone.
Await me. I’ll return anon . . ,
Where were we? Well, it had to be
When Mokje went without his tea —
A night’s starvation was enough;
He soon threw-up, and threw it off.
Next evening, it struck again;
John even suffered with disdain,
After some argument, to soil
His “palate fine” with castor oil,
Which failed to stay in prison pent,
But soon returned the way it went —
Alas, one feels, on such occasions,
Divided loyalty’s persuasions;
One longs to say, “Now, look here, durn it, yer
Making a fine mess of the furniture!”
But one retains control, somehow;
“There, son, do you feel better now?”
Don’t help me up; I still can totter.
Yes, when you gotter go, you gotter . . .
Now, where ? By this time, Mrs. Swill
Was looking peaked, you might say, ill.
Her only comment was a terse
Remark that, well, she could feel worse—
Deceit, of course; but one forgives
These inexactitudes of wives;
I’d even praise the small deceit
That helps to keep them on their feet
To see the cat and children fed
And bring my breakfast in to bed:
Could it have been the cauliflower,
She asked, that had her in its power?
The cheese? The jam? The little cakes?
The milk? The weekly tart she bakes?
The ah, no! no! we couldn’t bear it,
The thought that it might be the claret
That made our little firm infirm —
And so we settled for A Germ.
Don’t go; but please excuse me, all —
The telephone—an urgent call . . .
Yes, well, by now, perhaps, you’ve guessed
That I was stricken with the rest;
1 crept at midday through our door;
The castor-oil came out once more
And, standing by the kitchen-sink
I said, “Observe a Christian drink!”
(As Addison desired to die)
But in my son’s malicious eye
I saw no Christian charity,
And in my wife’s exuberant measure
1 saw some unconnubial pleasure—
So, in the circumstances, friend,
It’s noble of me to attend
And give you this —these —interviews,
Though, if you’re wanting further news
I’d ask you, please, to show more lenience
And visit me at my convenience.

“Old Unionist”: Many of these New
Australians, without seeming to loaf,
manage to do a great deal less work
than dinkum Aussies who make no
pretence about their loafing periods but
buck in when they decide to end them.
Still, one with me is at least a trier. A
job had to be done with old materials, and,
handing the job to him, I told him to do
it as well as possible. “Mister,” he
assured me earnestly, “I vill do heim
better than possible.” That high aim was
not attained ; but it wasn’t a bad job.
“Kelms”: The two unluckiest men in
Australia must be thft trick rifle-shooter
at the 1951 Perth Royal Show, puncturing
balls in a tent, and the young man
struck in the leg two tents away by a
.22 bullet. Of all the people at the Show,
the victim had to be a bleeder, a
hemophilic ; a normally superficial wound
required in this case repeated blood-
sdf
transfusions, and action that rendered the
leg a 90 per cent, disability ; and though
medical evidence was that the leg was less
useful than a wooden one, the man’s con-
dition made amputation impossible. He
claimed heavy damages, and got them.
* * * *
“Kelvin”: I got my first grey hairs
because of atrocious calligraphy (B.
7/5/ ’52) on discovery of £4 Is. 6d. differ-
ence between the master-control-account
?nd the individual bank-balances of a
thousand-odd Binghi capitalists, the Gub-
mint's raw material in a Torres Straits
area. I sweated firkins of blood, then
wired south, confessing my depravity.
Do nothing, the South replied, until the
audit inspector arrived. That official
descended upon me, added my Binghi
balances, and got a perfect reconciliation.
I took a tot of o.p. and tried —£4 Is. 6d.
out. We then added the columns to-
gether. calling each figure aloud. Mid-
“Peace at last!"
way, he called “Nought” when I called
“sixpence.” Close investigation showed
that I had been adding as £4 Is. 6d. the
word “Nil” inscribed in my own hand
to show that one Tomsana Tarpot had
blued his worldly wealth to the last
penny.
* * * ♦
“Curate’s Egg”; The acrobatics of
Melbourne cable-tram conductors (B.
7/5/’52) were nothing to the perform-
ances of a Brisbane counterpart. To
the flappers up in front he crooned the
latest hit-tunes, and to the toilers in the
rear smoker he sang barroom ditties and
had a suitable item for each section as
he moved fore and aft. He reached the
zenith of his art on the day when, to
deafening plaudits, he emulated the per-
formance of a gentleman in an advertise-
ment the trams were then carrying, who
hung by his toecaps from the handles of
the straps provided for standing pas-
sengers in order to read with greater ease
the upside-down portion of a passenger’s
newspaper.
“Minto”; Transport systems all over
Australia are now in the gun ; losses on
Adelaide Municipal Tramways Trust hit
the headlines every few weeks, with dis-
cussions of shorter sections and higher
fares. Adelaide conductors are more
courteous than their Sydney colleagues,
but they have plenty of cheek. Finding
himself nearly prostrate under a weight
of coins, the Adelaide conductor makes
a circuit of the tram bawling “Change
of a pound. Who wants change of a
pound?” Apparently their toes get
trodden-on like those of common
passengers; ours showed a lovely sense
of either self-protection or sarcasm this
morning, wearing football-boots.
“Doric”: The N. S. Wales Act putting
the onus on passengers to pay their fares
probably applies in Milan. I took a seat
in a tram there, and awaited the con-
ductor ; then noticed a rather lordly
person in uniform in a comfortable chair
railed-off from the vulgar; passengers
were queueing to pay him money, which
he rang-up in a kind of cash-register be-
side him, languishingly handing back
tickets —it was enough to make our foot-
board-clamberers die with envy. The
fare was 25 lire, about threepence,
whether you went one stop or all the
way.
“Oswin”: Thirty years ago I was a
patient in the Victorian Eye and Ear
Hospital on the corner of Victoria-
parade and Gisborne-street. The donging
of a bell every time the cable-tram passed
intrigued me, but no one could explain
until, years after, an old cable-tram driver
told me that wherever a curve was to be
rounded the driver put on a spurt until
the bell rang. That was his cue to release
the doover that gripped the cable. The
tram would keep going until it rounded
the curve, when he would grip the cable
again. That also was why the driver
was called a gripman.
* * * *
“Loulalo”: Phenomena like the
Brocken Spectre and mirages are caused
by freak combinations of light-waves,
atmospheric conditions and visual aware-
ness. Years ago, in Portland (Vic.), the
stationmaster and others were astounded
to see the train which had left some time
before and which, according to time-
table, should have been at another station
30 miles away slowly shunting along the
main line, which runs between the road
and the ocean beach. Ringing the other
station to find out why the train was
returning, the s.m. was assured that the
train was not only where it should be
but was, at that moment, shunting to the
tank to take on water. The approaching
apparition vanished as suddenly as it had
appeared, but was the subject of gossip
and speculation for a long time after.
The favorite theory was that it was some
form of photographic projection with
light-waves reflecting from the mirror of
the near-by ocean.

“Q. Ree”: I can’t see how “P.0.M.C.”
(B. 30/4/’52) could lie “prone” on his
back —unless, like Janus, he has two faces
facing opposite ways. Otherwise,
“supine.”

“Akarana”: In re inscriptions on build-
ings to perpetuate owners’ names;
“Hamer” (B. 7/5/’52) mistook the King-
street building opposite the Supreme
Court —it was Darley Chambers, after
Sir Matthew Darley, C.J., which was
acquired by Crowley and changed to
Crowley Chambers. Crowley’s grouch
was against Darley, C.J., who, in 1904,
presided over a defamation trial in which
Crowley was plaintiff. Long Innes was
not concerned with the matter, and was
then a junior barrister,
“Winchester”: Bent-street, Sydney,
was named after Ellis Bent, Judge-
Advocate during part of Macquarie's
term, not Surveyor-General Bent —my
authority is “The Street Names of Early
Sydney and Some Street History,” by
C. H. Bertie, Vol. XXXVI Part 1, of the
Royal Historical Society’s Journal of
1950. That the origin of the name is
not generally known helps prove
“Hamer's” statement (B. 7/5/’52) about
passing fame.

“Den”: Roget’s Thesaurus of English
Words and Phrases is 100 this year; it
first appeared on April 29, 1852. Peter
Mark Roget (1779-1869) was an English
doctor of Swiss descent. He entered
Edinburgh University at 14 and gradu-
ated at 19; his aptitudes, besides bio-
logical butchery, were mechanics and
chess; he was for 22 years secretary to
the Royal Society. On retirement from
this secretaryship he began compiling the
Thesaurus which he had been planning
since his twenties; a reference book
which, instead of explaining the meaning
of words, like a dictionary, would present
an idea, and then list the words by which
it could be expressed. At his death, aged
90, 28 editions had been printed. The
only two subsequent editors have been
his son, John Lewis Roget, and his
grandson, Samuel Romilly Roget.

“L.S.M.”: Potential customers can
relieve the tedium of door-to-door
canvassing. During the depression I gave
one woman a sample bottle of lemon
hand-lotion. “Mr. T she
said when 1 next called, calling
me by the name of the firm,
“how much of that little bottle
of lemon you gave me the other
day would I use in making a
pudding for my husband?”
Knocking early one morning at
an open door I was sur-
prised by the lady of the house
coming round from the side. “Go
straight through,” she said. I stayed
put. “Go on,” she repeated. “Go
straight through to the bedroom. It’ll
be all right.” I said, “There must be
some mistake.” She looked me over
again, her glance settling on my sample-
case. “Aren’t you the doctor?” she
asked. Another woman listened patiently
to my long discourse on a synthetic egg-
mixture, then smiled and said very kindly,
“Oh, but, Mr. T , we keep fowls!”
I sold her some poultry-powder.

“Quilliam-street”: The bishop whose
reported death on the seashore prostrated
his English relations was no Queensland
divine as stated by Hamilton Fyfe in his
memoirs (B. 21 /5/ ’52). He was Augustus
Short, first bishop of Adelaide, who ruled
the diocese from 1847 to 1881. The
shore was Largs Bay beach, about 10
miles from Adelaide; the name of the
newspaper eludes me, as does that of the
sea-serpent.

“Becks”: “Alsace” wants to know who
Philgarlic was (B. 21/5/’52). Originally
the term meant a bald-headed man, the
line of descent being peeled garlic, pilled
garlic, pilgarlic. The Oxford Dictionary
notes a first reference to pilgarlic in
1529 and records that by the 17th
century the word was used in a “ludi-
crously contemptuous way” and later,
with the adjective poor, in the self-
commiserating sense of “poor me.” I
fancy Billy Elton or some other comedian
of his vintage used to refer to himself as
“poor old Philgarlic,” and that this is
where “Alsace’s” father, like mine, got
the term. There is probably also some
connection with the circus clown, tradi-
tionally bald, and always the butt of
everyone in the show,

“P.0.M.C.”: Old-time-style, heavy
hobnailed boots, real hobnails, might be
available to “Kelms” (B. 14/5/’52) at the
general store of any mining township.
I wouldn’t guarantee that the soles aren’t
highly - compressed brown - paper, but
they’re tough. As an ex-coalmine :
electrician, I can assure him that the
hobnails really grab the ground on steep or
slippery grades—Rothbury averaged one
in 2\ —and the boots support rather than
tire when one grows used to their un-
gainliness.

the motherly ministrations of Kreisler’s

incapable of looking after himself —which
may have been right; Galli-Curci send-
ing a message to a girl in a corner seat

VERY SAD CASE.
“Ever-increasing lunch costs fall with greatest,
feveritv on the younger members of the office stalls.
—Sydney “D.T.” correspondent.
Cedric, our office-boy, a callow youth,
A very racy, tenuous specimen,
Who wasn’t quite on speaking terms with 1 tutu,
Who coughed over a gasper now and then
And boasted but one expletive: “Aw, struth.
Noted was he for these; he had a yen
For speech in words limited to one syllable;
Also, he was accounted quite unfillable.
By nine-fifteen his cavernous, empty turn
Would think his throat was cut; and then
would he,
Parking behind his ear his chewing-gum,
Fall with a very wolfish sort of glee
Upon the dozen sandwiches his Mum
Had cut him for his lunch. But that would be
Only a temporary alleviation
Of post-breakfast, pre-morning-tea starvation.
The strength thus gained from this modest repast
Would last young Cedric almost until noon;
By then the effects of that long-drawn-out fast
Were such that, in grave danger of a swoon
From weakness, he would totter out at last,
His inside doubtless shrivelled like a prune.
To gather pies and buns would be his mission,
Then joyously he’d speed their demolition.
When not somnambulating he would eat.
Thus did he pass his rather pleasant day.
Never had he been known to be replete.
The estimation was that, of his pay,
Some eighty-five per cent, he’d use to beat
The pangs of ’tween-meal hunger. His display
Was something to astonish —and to flummox.
One theory was that he possessed two stomachs.
But then meat pies were just a trizzy each;
The same for large, well-filled cream horns.
As well,
For tuppence he could get a hefty peach,
A thickly-buttered roll —enough to quell
His hunger for a bob. Bereft of speech
Was Cedric when there tolled the awful
knell,
When pies shot up to prices astronomical
And thereby shrunk his intake anatomical.
Still hollow-legged, Cedric’s a junior now.
It costs a quid to take her to the flicks,
And fifteen-bo.b for ties that are a wow.
So that, for high-priced food, he’s left with
nix.
A very serious problem, you’ll allow,
One that might well perplex a Dotty Dix.
In short, spiralling costs —Oh, what vexation!
Have made poor Cedric victim of deflation.

The WILLOW
KING
by HENRY
WILLIAMS
IT was impossible to imagine
Frederick Podmore as ever
having been younger than
forty. He dwelt in a per-
petual fiftyish twilight, a neat,
restrained, unobtrusive figure
who sat in the corner seat of a
bus or suburban train as easily
and as naturally as more dash-
ing men in more dashing ages sat
astride fiery chargers.
Frederick Podmore had never
ridden a horse in his life;
furthermore, he had no wish to.
His equestrian interests were
acutely limited in time to a week
in November, when, because he
was not a man to defy great
national traditions, he bought,
against his better judgment, a
two-shilling ticket in the office
sweep for the Melbourne Cup.
The firm of J, Lumley and
Son, for which Frederick Pod-
more had worked for more than
thirty years, was pleased to
describe itself as “an old-
established firm” and had large
imposing red-brick offices stand-
ing a little way off the
suburb’s road. It engaged itself
in the manufacture of bear-
ings, castings, supports, brackets
and other useful commodities
that do not very often come up
for discussion in intellectual
circles.
Beginning with the firm as a
shy, well-mannered junior of
seventeen, Frederick Podmore
had become, by dint of con-
scientiousness and reliability
rather than any forward bril-
liance, one of the heads of the
staff.
He was polite to his colleagues,
but never familiar; acquaint-
anceship for him never developed
into anything more. He seemed
a man quite contented with his
own company.
He lent a donnish air of
decorum and unworldliness to
the commeraal atmosphere in
which he moved. A breezy
young traveller had once
addressed him as “F.P.,” but
Frederick Podmore had assumed
the look of an aloof monarch
frowning upon the familiarities
of a forward and ill-mannered
courtier.
The other members of the staff
generally regarded him as a
slightly eccentric but likeable
figure. There was a pleasing
negativeness about him, and he
was explained to any newcomer
by some such remark as “That’s
old Podmore. He’s bats about
cricket.”
ONCE a year the employees
of J. Lumley and Son en-
gaged in a cricket match, Staff
versus Works, and it was only
on these occasions that Frederick
Podmore seemed really to come
into the orbit of his fellow-
men.
At the firm’s annual dinner he
was an uncomfortable back-
ground figure, nervously sipping
a small glass of whisky and
always taking the first oppor-
tunity to leave and go home
after what, for him, had obvi-
ously been a most pointless and
unprofitable evening.
But on each occasion of the
annual cricket-match he was a
man aglint with purpose. For
twenty-five years he had been
opening batsman for Staff, and
upon the slightest provocation
he would inform anyone, be-
tween quiet whiffs of his pipe,
“I have never yet failed to reach
double-figures.”
His style of play had become
institutional in the annual cricket
matches of J. Lumley and Son.
He would come out like a man
who realised that the fate of
empires hung upon the preserva-
tion of his wicket, presenting a
broad unscoring bat to any ball
that was not asking to be
smacked to the boundary: such
balls he would push for a wary
single. No amount of raucous-
sounding advice from impatient
and ill-mannered onlookers to
“have a go” could shake him
out of his massive caution: the
self-appointed task of reaching
double-figures was one which
Frederick Podmore pursued with
the relentlessness of a fanatic.
One memorable year he had
been what had looked suspici-
ously like l.b.w. on the first ball
of the match. In fact, Mr.
Perkins, the meek and elderly
cashier acting as umpire, had
raised his hand. Frederick
Podmore was not of a very im-
posing stature and had no beard:
but he had remained standing
at the crease, glaring at Mr.
Perkins in a manner that the late
vV. G. Grace could never have
surpassed. Mr. Perkins had
hurriedly reversed his decision,
and, in his usual laborious
and crab-like style, Frederick
Podmore had gone on to double-
figures.
When he had made his in-
evitable ten runs, however,
Frederick Podmore’s style always
underwent a phenomenal change.
It was as though he felt that the
attainment of double-figures
released him from the mesh of
caution, the burden of doing-
die - thing -by - the - team, the
shackles of responsibility.
Casting aside the style which
suggested a parallel, in progres-
sive rate, with the glacial move-
ments of some geological ice-
cap, he would immediately try to
emulate the gayer moods of
Harvey and Miller, waltzing
down the pitch with toreador-
iike fire, wielding his bat like
some wine-drenched d’Artagnan
flourishing a rapier. Thus,
though he had never scored less
than ten, he had never scored
more than twenty, and was
usually out through trying to hit
some ball to which Bradman
would have played a straight bat.
CAUSE and effect are oft
related by the flimsiest and
most finely-drawn texture of
chance; and the cause of
Frederick Podmore not continu-
ing indefinitely into the future
as opening batsman for Staff
was the advent of Roger K.
Hickman.
Roger K. Hickman’s entry
into the hierarchy of J. Lumley
and Son was in turn the result
of the tendencies of the most
recent J. Lumley.
J. Lumley, Junior, had dreams
of expansion much grander than
those of any of his predecessors.
His highest wish was to be
termed “dynamic,” and in pur-
suance of this wish he had
visited the United States of
America, where he had persuaded
Roger K. Hickman, who came
under the somewhat vague classi-
fication of “efficiency expert,”
to come to Sydney to be env
ployed by J. Lumley and Son as
a production supervisor.
Roger K. Hickman was a
dynamic young man who drew
graphs and talked a lot about
output, efficiency and schedules.
Frederick Podmore was not
sure that he liked Roger K.
Hickman, but he had been will-
ing to keep an open mind on the
subject until one day about three
weeks before the annual cricket
match, when the American had
declared, within Frederick Pod-
more’s hearing, “I don’t know
what you guys see in cricket.
If you once saw a good game
of baseball you’d put away your
cricket bats for good.”
Frederick Podmore’s normally
unaggressive features had frozen
into a mask of indifference.
Despite Roger K. Hickman’s
declamation, preparations for
the match had proceeded along
normal channels, and Roger K.
Hickman himself, who was an
adaptable and forward fellow,
was actually numbered in the
Works eleven when the day
arrived. He had put in two or
three evenings’ practice in “this
trick of bowling,” as he called it.
THE match was always
played on a sports-ground in
Leichhardt. It was a single-
innings game, and Works had
batted first and amassed the
respectable total of 107.
Frederick Podmore, clad ia
immaculate white flannels, wear-
ing his privately-owned batting-
gloves, had gone in to open for
Staff with one of the junior
accountants.
Reg Armstrong, chief tool-
setter, and captain of the Works
eleven for many years, had been
accustomed to nonchalantly
throwing the ball to the bowler
of his choice to open the attack.
With Roger K. Hickman on the
field he had no such choice. As
Staff’s opening batsman walked
to the pitch, Hickman grabbed
the ball, took off his pullover
and loudly announced that he
would “take first throw and see
THE SNAKE.
Withdrawing from the amorous grasses
from the warm and luscious water
the snake is soul untouched by both
nor does the fire of day through which it passes
mark it or cling. Immaculate navigator
it carries death within its mouth.
Soul is the snake that moves at will
through all the nets of circumstance
like the wind that nothing stops,
immortal movement in a world held still
by rigid anchors of intent or chance
and ropes of fear and stays of hopes.
It is the source of all dispassion
the voiceless life above communion
secret as the spring of wind
nor does it know the shames of self-confession
the weakness that enjoys love’s coarse dominion
or the betrayals of the mind.
Soul is the snake the cool viator
sprung from a shadow on the grass
quick and intractable as breath
gone as it came like the everlasting water
reflecting God in immeasurable space—
and in its mouth it carries death.

“Free Ballooning,” said Mr.

Frederick Podmore took strike
against the boisterous Roger K.
Hickman, and as the American,
arms flailing wildly, came to the
end of his long, staggering, and
enormously intimidating run,
Frederick Podmore, with raised
bat and set jaw, advanced from
his crease, intent on hitting the
first ball into the nearest Pacific
inlet. That airy remark of the
American’s anent the trivialities
of cricket had obviously gone
deep.
Only an infinitesimal propor-
tion of Podmore’s herculean
strokes ever did connect with the
ball. A split-second later,
Hickman's odious and triumph-
ant “Yippee!” loud in his ears,
Frederick Podmore turned with
horror-stricken eyes to view the
wreck of his wicket. The proud
record of twenty-five years had
been broken by a yorker, bowled
by a man who thought cricket
was inferior to baseball. Never
again would he be able to tell
anyone “And I’ve never yet
failed to reach double-figures.”
There was the pale, set cast of
tragedy about Frederick Pod-
more’s features as he began his
slow walk back to the pavilion.
Under such a cloud, one
imagines, did Hannibal turn back
towards Carthage, did Napoleon
leave the charred shell of
Moscow and begin his weary
trek back to the West. The still
Leichhardt evening was charged
with doom.
Frederick Podmore’s team-
mates had enough sense of the
occasion to say nothing beyond
a few words of commiseration.
He sat apart, a disconsolate,
wretched figure, and after two
or three more wickets had fallen
he put on his jacket and left.
Dazed, unseeing, uncaring, he
walked out recklessly into the
Parramatta-road as though it
were a secondary highway be-
tween Oodnadatta and Charlotte
Waters, and was promptly
knocked down and fatally in-
jured by a tram going to
Circular Quay.
|_l E had lived by himself in a
1 small brown stone house in
one of the quiet streets of Stan-
more. His nearest relative was
a married sister, and it was she
who went through his personal
belongings after his demise.
When she finally found the key
that opened the locked drawer
in the sideboard and saw the
sheaf of carefully-preserved
letters held together with a
colored band, her womanly in-
terest quickened. She had some-
times wondered why her brother
had never married.
But these were not love-
letters ; in fact, they were not
letters at all. They were score-
sheets, written out in violet ink,
•the calligraphy executed with
loving care.
They covered a period from
about 1930, and detailed the
scores in a gargantuan series of
fictitious Test matches between
England and Australia, in which
England would have been easily
triumphant if it had not been for
the epic achievements of a certain
F. Podmore, opening Australian
bat.
Thus, one of the earlier score-
sheets recorded a match in which
the rest of the Australian eleven,
including Kippax, Ponsford and
Woodfull, had been skittled for
a mere 83 ; but the day had been
saved for Australia by F. Pod-
more, who carried his bat for
176. On another glorious occa-
sion, when Bradman had been
clean-bowled for a miserable
five, F. Podmore had been
caught Hammond, bowled Lar-
wood, 268.
The record continued through
the years. All the other names
were adjusted to the times, but
F. Podmore was there on every
sheet, enjoying a perennial prime,
impossibly constant in his
mammoth scores, the everlast-
ing sheet-anchor of his side.
The most recent match
recorded was one in which
Morris, Harvey, Miller, Hassett
and several other not entirely
unaccomplished batsmen had
been dismissed for an amazingly
low number of runs; but once
again Australia had been saved,
because F. Podmore was caught
Hutton, bowled Wright, 203.
A SHEAF of papers pinned
together separately detailed
the complete scores in the annual
matches of J. Lumley and Son
ever since F. Podmore had been
opening-bat for Staff. In these
veracity had been observed, and
F. Podmore had scored 10, 12,
15, 11, 10 and so forth: not as
imposing as the Test matches, but
at least there had always been
double-figures against his name.
On the last sheet, carefully
prepared beforehand and all
ready for completion, were the
names, in batting order, of the
two teams that had taken part
in the last fateful match. But
a Circular Quay tram had spared
Frederick Podmore the final
despair of writing, in violet ink
in that exquisite and painstaking
hand,

ABORIGINALITIES
“Mat’s Mate”: We got into the Albion
at Coota. (N.S.W.) in time for tea, and
after that, drifted into the “lownge,”
where we discovered a somewhat aloof
young bloke listening to the wireless. He
glanced at us in a manner which plainly
suggested that he hoped we wouldn’t be
so uncouth as to speak or otherwise
interrupt, and we respected this silent
request. The radio was playing a record-
ing of a piano solo. When it ended the
young bloke said reverently, “Oh, good.
Oh, good.” Mat spoke up. “Aw, 1
dunno,” he said. “That’s The Melody
in F,’ ain’t it?” “It is,” said the y.b.
coldly. “That’s right,” Mat said. “Well,
that bloke didn’t do a bad job, but y’
ought t’ hear Moiseiwitsch on it. He’d
make that bloke look silly.” The young
bloke looked at Mat. “Where did you
hear Moiseiwitsch?” he asked. “Couple
of years back,” Mat said. “On the radio
in the Commercial at Echuca.” “And
you believe he is better than this fellow?”
“Too blanky right.” “Well, let me tell
you that was Moiseiwitsch you just
heard.” Anyone else would have been
dashed, Not Mat. He stood up his full
6ft. 2in. and glared down at the young
bloke. “Whatinell’s that got to do with
it?” he roared. “I still say the way he
“Serves you right. Now maybe you'll do something about those white-
ants
played it at Echuca was a hundred per
cent, better.” The young bloke gave me
a wild and defeated look and got him-
self out of there.

“Vet”: Had a small job that called for
a tradesman, so booked-up the only one
available. A week or so back he arrived,
did the work, then sought me to tell me
what I owed him. “Strike me!” I
gasped. “That’s over nine quid a day.”
“The time don’t come into it,” he ex-
plained. “Shouldn’t matter to you how
sobri I finish. Y’ see, it’s contract. I
work out all me jobs this way now, and
keep me own hours. Gripes, I thought
y’d’ve noticed I worked later last night.”
Then, last week, I wanted a cow brought
out from town. I was flat-out, and it
seemed more economical to get a youth
to bring the beast out, then catch a ride
back on a motor-transport. He duly
arrived at the yards where I was dosing
stocks. “Here’s y’r cow,” he announced.
“And that’s a fiver y’ owe me.” “A fiver
for half a day’s work!” “It’s what we
reckon the job’s worth y’ pay on, not
the time it takes,” he grinned. “They all
do it that way now.” Yes? Well, I’m
wondering how other cockies contend
with this new menace. Do they buy
wages-tax stamps from their own pockets,
over and above the highway-robbery
demand, or do they meekly submit to the
popular criticism that the cocky avoids
such things by falsely claiming his jobs
are done by contract?

“Curate’s Egg”: Doddering Dame
Nature, whose reproduction-schedules
give evidence of the anarchy of her long-
term planning, is a ruthlessly efficient
police-informer. The hands of even
identical twins have minor pattern-dis-
crepancies distinguishable by the finger-
print expert. Mirror-twins, about a
fourth of all identical twins, might have
caused trouble, as their hands make
identical markings; but here Nature has
again proved her thoughtfulness for the
Force; the whorls in their prints are re-
versed, hand for hand, digit for digit.
The same image-in-reverse extends to all
facial and bodily features of mirror-twins,
even to clock- and anti-clockwise whorls
in the hair of each; indeed, those who
claim that the mirror-pattern extends to
the minds of mirror-twins adduce the
famous French pair, Auguste and Jean
Piccard: Auguste seeks his scientific
laurels in the stratosphere, while Jean
seeks his in the bathysphere.

“Wai-Weer”: Apropos of the move to
bring in Filipinos for the pearling in-
dustry in North Australia, the wheel seems
to have turned full circle. Filipino
divers came into the picture in northern
waters in the early dress-diving days of
the ’seventies; but they went out again
when tempting offers came to the pearlers
from Japanese divers, who said that (un-
like the Manila-men) they weren’t worried
about religious scruples in working on
Sundays, and would be very happy
(excuse!) to receive lower wages than the
others. Statistics show that by 1893 there
were 498 Japanese employed at Thursday
Island alone ; in 1913 the T.I. figures were
—Europeans, seven, Filipinos, 22, and
Japanese, 655, out of the total 1300
or so engaged in the industry, the others
being chiefly mainland aborigines,
Papuans, Torres Strait and South Sea
Islanders and Malays. The Influence of
the Nips in the industry was such that
on one occasion on Thursday Island 700
of them staged a big demonstration
when making demands for further conces-
sions from the pearling companies, which
were forced to capitulate. This was one
of the happenings which caused the
natives of the neighboring Torres Strait
islands to ask: “Who boss? Whiteman
or Japanee?” I’m wondering, if the
Filipinos come back again, how long it
will be before the old procedure is re-
peated.
“M.S.”: It was Hec’s first day fencing
for old Bill. The line was already pegged,
and on the tick of time old Bill dropped
a shoulderful of tools on the site, and
they started in. Slowly the row of post-
holes travelled up the lightly-timbered
slope, until Hec stopped at a big grey-
box that cut the edge of the line. “Leave
that’n,” yelled Bill. “No time f’r that
now. We’ll fix that later.” Hec skirted
the obstacle, glancing as he did at many
more trees that must come out before
the job could be satisfactorily completed.
“Get back to the end of the queue!”
At 10 minutes to 12 old Bill set fire to
some rubbish and put on the billy.
“Time!” he bawled, as the bubbles rose.
“Alwuz believe in givin’ a man his full
hour f’r dinner,” he remarked, as Hec
came up. “Hurry an’ get stuck inter y’r
samwidges.” No sooner had they eaten
than Bill was again on his feet. “Might’s
well get that tree off, while we’re doin’
nothin’,” he suggested. “Bring the saw,
will y’, while I get the bar.” The tree
was down, and the stump almost out of
its hole, when, pausing for breath. Bill
again glanced at his ancient time-piece.
“Gripes, just on one,” he puffed. “Time
we stopped messin’ round here now, Hec,
an’ got back t’ work.”

“Macnell”; Divers reported that
Orcades’ hull, after kissing the mud in
Port Phillip, was undamaged. But
(though sub-surface coral snags can peel
steel-plates open like a banana-skin) it
is the sea pounding against a resistant
hull that is a ship’s main enemy. I’ve
seen an Arab dhow in an Indian Ocean
monsoon, riding easily into ’em with a
wisp of foresail up, barely shipping a
cupful. She was borne on the waves
sliding under her. Once, in the Kiriwinas,
I went aboard a long tanker which had
slid half her length up on a reef ; beneath
her unsupported stern the sea dropped
deep. A strong wind raised waves which
battered her resistant iron tail with re-
lentless savagery. Inside you could hardly
hear yourself talk for the incessant clang ;
each wave lifted itself in a ridge of
apparent liquidity and struck like a steel
hammer, belting and wrenching. Our
frigate, with all her 6000 horse-power,
could exert a pull of only 14 tons on the
tow-wire. Luckily the big Navy
tug from Singapore reached her in time.
The reef had scraped a few holes which
pumps could have handled; the sea
would have scrapped her.

“W.M.H.”: Most consistent worker at
the Parafield (S.A.) Government poultry
farm was a White Leghorn which laid
281 eggs and won the annual egg-laying
competition by one egg. Usually one
bird builds up a big lead early, and wins
by a wide margin, but this year the even-
tual winner was closely challenged
throughout by an Australorp which, had
it not suffered an attack of nerves on
the last day, might have managed a draw.
Allowing the winner the same conditions
as other workers—a five-day week, eight
public holidays and fourteen days’ annual
leave, Mrs. Leghorn delivered the goods
on every working day and did overtime
on another 42 days.

“Gravelsnatcher”: That account of
“Aestur’s” mate who ran the way the
tree was falling and got his hair brushed
(B. 30/4/’52) took me back to when I
was scrub-rolling in the wheatbelt. You
know the way it’s done—you drag a big
roller behind a tractor, with a side
draught that allows the tractor to skirt
the scrub that the roller is to push over.
By glancing over your shoulder you can
usually see what’s coming, but occasion-
ally you’d underestimate the height of a
tree and you’d look around to see it
bearing down on you. That posed a nice
problem. You could sit there and take
the blow, hoping that only the top leaves
would get you, or you could stop the
tractor and hope that the tree still had
sufficient grip on the soil to keep it
upright while you got out and chopped
it down. If you stopped and it con-
tinued to fall you were hit with lower
branches than if you kept going, but if
you got knocked out you couldn’t be
run over by the stationary roller. That
has happened to blokes who took a
chance and kept going, and were knocked
off into the path of the roller. Of course
we could always have jumped and left
the tractor to its own devices, but that
never seemed to occur to us. No, I don’t
know how the modern young bloke
would tackle that problem at all.

“G. Elburg”: The report of a com-
mittee set up by the British Home Office
to investigate alleged cruelty involved in
field sports included this gem:
It was proved
that animals do
not experience
fear or mental
stress to the
degree imagined.
Hunted foxes, for
example, will
even stop and
kill fowls while
being chased by
hounds.
Huntin’, alas, is not what it was in the
good old days. Now the field is mounted
on Clydesdales and the pack is composed
of pugs recruited from my lady’s boudoir.
Reynard consequently has plenty of time
for his poultry meal as he ambles along a
mile or so ahead of the hunt.
* * * *
“Tarsal”; One of our most useful
drugs was first discovered by a quack
(B, 19/3/’52). Some 150 years ago in
England an old woman was in business
as a herbalist; she used a potion which
was eagerly sought by sufferers from
heart complaints. The local doctor be-
came curious, for that herbal extract
was undoubtedly giving great relief to
some sufferers. He procured a bottle of
it and had it analysed, to find that it
contained extracts of barks, roots and
flowers. Five of them were utterly
worthless from a medical point of view,
but the other one was a real treasure —
an extract of foxglove flowers, whose
active principal, digitalis, has the effect
of slowing down the heart’s action. A
wonky heart can rest only in that tiny
pause between beats; digitalis lengthens
those pauses, enabling the heart to
recover quicker than if untreated. It
stands to reason that among the weird
and wonderful substances used as medi-
cine by quacks, Chinese or otherwise,
there will occasionally be something
beneficial, but for every such case there
are a hundred others where the sufferer
swallows ground-up fossil teeth, dried
and powdered maggots, rat-gall and other
abominations, Adelaide once had one of
these Chinese quacks; the medical staff
of Royal Adelaide Hospital used to see
frequent examples of the harm which be
had done.
WALKABOUT.
Come! Let us tramp to where the leichhardts
spread
Their dark-green mantle where the waters flow.
We’ll climb tall mountains, to behold below
Grand rugged scenes. Or let us hear once more
Slim sheoaks sighing by the sandy shore,
As south-east trades go hissing overhead.
We’ll go by plane, and hear its engines roar
As through the clouds we glide; and see below
The dark-green lines of trees where waters flow;
To gaze enchanted on some well-known town,
Now chequered pattern on the green and brown
Dull wavy surface of the earth’s broad floor.
We’ll visit cities where the ferries ply
Over green waters, and we’ll see the flow
Of human beings racing to and fro,
A roaring moving horde that fades as night
Comes into being with the neon-light
That casts its radiance to the cloudy sky.
Then back once more to roam the lonely North
And hear the native hunters in their camp
Shout ’midst the chanting . . . Hear the pound-
ing stamp
Of dancing tribesmen . . . Let us hear anew
The lazy droning of the didjeridoo
Waking dark ghosts to tread the hot red earth.
We’ll light our fires by night when winds blow
cold.
The earth shall be our bed, the trees our home.
We’ll ride the years with laughter as we roam.
Bush-shades shall be our shelter from the sun,
And then at last when drifting days are done,
Our thoughts will still go on though we are old.
N.T.

“Salmon Gums”: Add to Binghi’s
medical knowledge (B. 7 / 5 / ’52) a realisa-
tion of the value of eucalyptus-oil. His
cure for rheumatism was to dig a trench
a couple of feet deep, fill it with sticks
and small logs and set fire to them.
When the ground was sufficiently heated
a layer of eucalypt leaves was placed in
the trench and the sufferer was laid on
top of them. Another layer of leaves
followed, after which the trench was
filled in. The patient stayed there with
only his head showing until the doctor
reckoned he’d had enough, Don Munday,
who saw them treated that way out near
the Warburton Ranges, declares the cure
to have been pretty effective.

“Sackfair”: Old Buffer’s bulging eyes
were beginning to return to their sockets
when Charlie, his neighbor, came stroll-
ing across the paddock, but he was stiff
in a raging temper. “Blasted agents! ”he
roared, glaring at the cloud of dust fol-
lowing a car down the road. “They
come askin’ a man does he want to sell
his farm, and the moment he shows any
interest they start pickin’ it to bits. That
coot started off by findin’ fault with me
fences. What’s wrong with ’em —con-
siderin’ their age? Then he has ago at
that there gate ; reckons you shouldn’t
have to lift a gate back. Gor’ strike me,
if he’d had to open some of the gates
I’ve seen! Then he has a smack at the
“Stop worryin'—I telly' they won't go without us!"
house. He don’t like the way them three
lean-to roofs follow down one after the
other; tried to argue that there ain’t
enough head-room when it got to the
last addition. I just let him have his
head ; but when he starts tryin’ to tell
me this tank’s half-empty I done me
block properly.” Charlie nodded sympa-
thetically, finished rolling his cigarette,
and idly tapped the tank with the round
tobacco-tin. He looked surprised, tapped
a little higher, then lower. “You know,”
he said apologetically, “that’s your water-
line, that rung there.” “ ’Course it is,”
thundered Buller. “That’s why I flew at
the stupid coot. Tryin’ to tell a man his
tank’s half-empty when the blasted thing’s
half-full!”

“C. Coral”: Yet another Pelican
Island is located in Princess Char-
lotte Bay, off the N.Q. coast. It
got its name from Captain King, of the
Bathurst, when he was surveying up that
way in 1819, and consists almost entirely
of dead coral. King and Allan Cunning-
ham, the botanist (who was collecting
specimens for Kew Gardens), went ashore
there a year later, and found a flock of
pelicans with about 20 young ones, which
they killed and skinned for the down.
Cunningham doesn’t seem to have men-
tioned any pelican skeletons, but I recall
an island in Torres Strait where piles of
bird skeletons and bones could be seen,
mostly at the base of a tree-trunk. In
this case, though, neighboring islanders
told me carpet-snakes were responsible
for the collection, disgorging them after
disposing of the rest of the meal,
* * * *
“O’Shamus”; Nostalgia overtook me
while strolling through a city store. I
stopped, scanned the perfume bar, then
lifted a delicately-made sandalwood fan.
Its Chinese picture-story meant nothing
to me. Instead I saw a little home at
Barton, on the Nullarbor Plain. Dad
chopping wood. Children racing up from
nowhere to sniff the fragrance billowing
from an old gnarled stick. I saw two old
wood-cutters with axes across their
shoulders trudging towards scrub-covered
sandhills. The fallen sandalwood,
trimmed and stacked on lorries. Loaded
on to railway trucks. Shunted on to the
tea-and-sugar-train. Fading on its way
to Port Augusta. Yes, China bound!
“Can I help you. Madam?” The spell
was broken. Quickly I paid for the
fragrant morsel, my bit of the old nor’-
west.

“Taswegian”: Don’t know what the
“starlings” were that “Fairf” heard (B.
7/5/’52), but do know that the common
English bloke —black-green coat, jewelled
waistcoat, ragged beard, head-nodding
strut —has more than “a call”: he owns
a repertoire of musical sighs, bubbles and
whistles; and although he cannot boast
a song like the spring song of the black-
bird, he makes up for it with his talent
for mimicry, rendering in miniature the
summer-bird’s shirr, the warble of the
white-backed magpie, the chromatic scale
of the pallid-cuckoo. His chimney-top
concerts are particularly welcome here in
the Speck, for when winter has robbed
us of the fair-weather artists he adds his
voice to the voices of the honeyeaters
(who have been driven from the bush to
the gardens) and all-the-year-round per-
formers like the magpie and butcher-
bird.
* * * *
“Kelms”: Don’t know how it’s done,
but I can assure “Dee” (B. 7/5/’52) that
the curlew does vary the color of its
eggs to match the surroundings, at least
in W.A. The eggs are generally a stone
color with brown blotches, but the shades
of those two colors vary considerably
with the color of the ground. And I
can’t see “Dee’s” objection to the state-
ment. If, as he thinks, the explanation
of, say, a chameleon’s ability to change
color “lies in some mechanistic reaction
to the new surroundings,” then can’t the
same apply to the laying of an egg? A
“ He's not so strong — it's a HOLLOW tooth!"
chameleon doesn’t take days to change
its color; the change commences almost
as soon as the animal is placed against
a different colored background. So “diet
containing components of the new color-
pattern” can’t enter into it. Eggs are
colored by means of a pigment in the
bird’s body, and, frequently, out of a
clutch the last egg to be laid will have
less coloring than the others, indicating
that the supply of pigment has run out.
I think it’s at least as feasible that a bird
could vary the pigment in its eggs, as that
an animal can vary the pigment in its
skin.
* * * *
“H.A.L.”: I’ll confirm everything that
“The Missus” says about hares dancing
(B. 19/3/’52). I can also offer her this
advice: if she is fond of hare on a
plate, and the pusses use that same piece
of ground on moonlit nights, she can
wait until they are engrossed in their
play, then walk up, select the best one,
bend down and grab it with both hands,
the right one gripping its neck and the
left one the small of its back, the thumb
on one side of the backbone and the
fingers on the other, pressing well into
the loin. Held like that, there is no
chance of the captive scratching or biting.
They appear to be quite oblivious of
human presence until seized. Hares play at
all times of the year on a smooth patch in
a level paddock at the first light of
dawn. Here they gather to squat in a
circle, sometimes a dozen at once; sud-
denly they begin to race around in a ring,
to stop as abruptly as they started. After
a rest, they go on again ; just as the light
’tarts to broaden they break the circle,
cace off in different directions and within
a few seconds there’s only that beaten
track on the ground to show that they’ve
been there.

“Solitude”: Seventyfiver was riding a
borrowed nag, and, making camp that
night on Blackfeller Bend, there came a
sudden exasperated cussing from the
region of his hack’s forelegs. “Blasted
hobble-strap must ’a’ bin rotten,” came
the explanation, after a few minutes.
“Broke clean through. Aw, cripes, what’s
a bloke gonna do now, Sol?” Collecting
wet firewood at the moment, I had
worries enough of my own. “If I let the
beggar go he’ll clear out,” came the voice.
“There ain’t enough feed about t’ tether
’im, an’ not a bit o’ fencing-wire in
miles. Whatcha reckon, Sol?” I struck
another match, and glared at the result.
“Ain’t even got a throat-lash on me
bridle,” resumed the voice, “or I c’d use
that. You got anything, Sol? Dunno
why they can’t make decent hobbles,” he
growled, “or else train their blasted nags
prop’ly. Aw, git t’ hell, Blue.” He broke
off to shove the mong to one side. “You
ain’t no good. Y’ got nothin’ t’
Eh? By cripes, yair, y’re right; so y’ have.
A good strong collar, eh? C’mere then.”
The voice paused for a minute or two,
then there was a satisfied grunt as the
old bloke rose. He glanced meaningly in
my direction. “One thing I like about
Blue,” he remarked to a gum-tree, “he
can think o’ somethin’.”

“Betcha”: Old Ted’s girl was very
proud of her abundant hair, and when,
at the local hop, the bloke from further-
out stared constantly in her direction,
she took it her crowning beauty had
brought another conquest! As the night
continued the bloke moved gradually
closer until at length he grinned git his
target along a mere couple of ffcet of
wooden bench. “Nice hair y’ got,” he
opened presently. “Thick, ain’t it, and
long.” The damsel smiled, and the con-
versation progressed. “Bet that hair o’
yours ’d be beaut in a plait,” remarked
the bloke a couple of dances later. “It’d
plait good an’ even, an’ stop sort o’ put,
wouldn’t it?” Supper followed soon
after; another dance or two ; then, as it
came time for home, the bloke decided
he was now sufficiently acquainted to
make his big approach. He took a deep
breath and moved in. “I wonder if you’d
—er.” He paused uncertainly. “You
live way out the other side of Brumby
Ridge, don’t you?” the girl put in.
“Yair.” “It must be awful lonesome out
there.” “Aw, I dunno. But, as I wus
sayin’, I wonder if y’d give me a bit of y’r
hair to take back home. Just a bit —
’bout so much.” The girl simpered. “Aw,
g’ on; y’d never miss it with that crop,”
he urged persuasively, “an’ I reckon it’d
make a beaut cracker f’r me stockwhip.”

“Brick E.”: The hills were swarming
with bunnies, but we were meat-hungry.
The builder had dumped us down on the
site of the new homestead, left us with
plan, materials,
camping - gear,
and provisions,
and had said
the owner
would keep the
meat - supply
up. On the
second day his
nibs brought a
flap of mutton, then he seemed to forget
we existed. After nearly a week of
vegetarian diet those rabbits began to look
like a mocking mirage to a thirsting
prospector. From across the creek came
a visitor. The old cove listened to our
whinge. “Aw, cripes,” he sympathised.
“I’ll set a few of me traps over here fr
yez.” Just before sundown he came back
and fulfilled his promise. We were about
to turn in for the night when a high-
pitched whistle came shrilling out of the
dark. “There’s our breakfast,” said the
chippy. “Not much sense in leaving him
there to suffer all night,” I opined, and,
in the callowness of my youth, led the
way to collect the trapped bunny. Before
we’d reached the trap another squeal
broke out. I was in the act of extricating
the second meal when the old bloke
burst upon us. If he wasn’t mad! We’d
hunted every rabbit away for the rest of
the night. We had no right to come near
the traps. We ought to learn to mind our
own business and wait till things were
given to us. It was then he caught his
fingers while savagely setting the trap
again. Then he really got angry. And
that was how I learnt that you could kick
a trapper’s dog, pinch his ’bacca, clear-
out with his missus, swipe his beer —and

NOBODY’S HORSES.
Through the night a muted neigh floats in on
the air’s caress
whence distantly a tall bright bay stands alone
and masteriess,
blurred against a misted moon
and the township’s deep lagoon.
Black and taffy, chestnut, grey, a-doze around
the arid yard,
hind hooves resting, heads to knees, where the
earth is baked stone-hard,
till the drovers in the lane
turn them on the road again . .
Nobody’s horses—ponies, draughts, farm-bred
hacks, and stock unbroken;
not for them the questing hand, murmurous
endearments spoken;
not for them the strain and spring
and ribboned pride of crowded ring.
Not for them the rhapsody of monsoon insanely
pouring
through deep eroded passes where the January
flood goes roaring,
unshod hooves on a burning track
or whip-weals’ smart on caking back;
Not for them the morning skirl of darting birds
in leafy corners,
violets crushed underfoot v#ith dewdrops there
as silent mourners;
furrows drawn till day grows late,
schoolboys calling from a gate . . .
Nobody’s horses on a mass migration, going
meekly, blindly,
leaving comfort, leaving fear, voices harsh or
voices kindly,
heading for an unknown quarter—
mobs of horses, sold for slaughter.

TRAPPED.
Oh the dawn-shot scrub-fox dangles loose
As I stride downhill in the fox-gold morning
And the sun is trapped by a spider’s noose
Between two boughs of a kurrajong burning.
In the crook of the road’s brown arm reclining
Gerroa’s roofs bloom from dun to rose
And over Black Rock like a kestrel shining
Time hangs still till the green wave moves.

THE VITAL MIDDLE EAST.
Militarily, always extremely
important (as Australians have
cause to know), the Middle East
now has a new role, as a vast
airfield, making it more import-
ant than ever before.
And now with the R.A.A.F.
joining in—as a beginning of
Australia’s new part in its de-
fence —the vital area becomes
again a focus of direct interest.
In overseas comment it has
been given a high-priority place
among the things to be discussed
with Mr. Menzies on his present
visit.
Australian airmen and troops
going there will find great
changes. A “New York Times”
correspondent has depicted it as
virtually one huge, vital and ex-
panding airdrome, from which
the strategic-bombing arm of the
Western side (which in this re-
spect means mostly America)
can be brought into immediate
and direct contact with any
aggressor in Europe or in
Western Asia.
Bases such as the immense
new landing field south of Casa-
blanca —one of five being built
in French Morocco—have, the
correspondent points out, tre-
mendous strategic implications.
Today the U.S. can keep its most
telling weapons—atomic bombs
and the huge planes that
carry them—safe in the heart of
America. Yet at a moment’s
notice, they could be moved to
Moroccan and other fields in a
matter of hours and brought to
bear upon a Power instigating
war.
Actually, an aerial armada
could take off from Carswell
Field in Texas and be on the
outer periphery of the Middle
East in less than a day,
“By gradually—if expensively
—developing the facilities of the
Middle East as the world’s best
airdrome, with vast stretches of
flat lands and generally excellent
weather, the United States can
make the power of its own most
valued weapons immediately
effective on a global basis.
Morocco is just the beginning of
this new strategical concept....
“If one recalls that a 836
carrying a payload of 10,0001 b.
can fly 5000 miles and return
non-stop one realises the full
implications involved. One has
only to take a divider, fix it
to the proper scale and swing it
in an arc northward and east-
ward on the map from Morocco,
to see how much of the earth’s
surface could be rendered vul-
nerable to an invading force.
“This development of global
strategy can be expanded as
much and as far as American
planners deem necessary and
economically wise. The farther
onward it moves across the
Middle East toward the petro-
leum deposits which are among
the treasures it hopes to protect,
the more efficient it is likely to
become.
“America already utilises
similar massive foreign bases —
in Greenland and in England, for
example. But, in a sense, these
are more isolated. In the Middle
East exists a vast potential air-
craft-carrier bordering a sea
under complete Allied control
and containing the fuel that
makes the dominant weapon
mobile.”
West's Weak Spot.
The Western Powers, in
London “Times’s” appraisal,
face greater dangers to their
positions in Asia than they faced
in Europe at the time of the
Communist coup in Czecho-
slovakia in February, 1948, and
they are less well organised to
meet them.
In Asia, it comments, they
have still no general agreement
on strategy for defence; they
fight far from their bases ; a,nd
many of the peoples are divided.
As Western strength grows the
balance of power may be better
adjusted, and as the Asian
peoples experience the benefits
of the independence and the sup-
port that have been granted
them, they may themselves be-
come more solid in resisting the
new imperialism. But for some
time ahead the Western Powers
may find it hard even to maintain
their positions:
“Direct Chinese intervention
is not the greatest or even the
most probable danger. China
has her own difficulties in
supplying and organising her
manpower; even now she has
not proclaimed any determina-
tion to intervene openly.
“What is certain is that China
will continue to give the
maximum encouragement and
some military supplies to the
insurgents in Indo-China and
give at least guidance to the
insurgents elsewhere, all in the
hope of wearing down Western
strength in the area.”
It means (the “Times” con-
cludes) that the Western Powers,
faced with the prospect of hav-
ing to fight a number of penin-
sular wars, will have to decide
which areas are vital to their
security and therefore to be held
at all costs.
Uncle Sam Fails.
“It is time to point out that
there has been a downright dis-
graceful failure to deliver
weapons and war goods in any-
thing like the quantity promised”
—that is to the Western com-
mand.
There has been plenty of U.S.
criticism of Europe’s tardiness ;
this, for a change, is U.S.
criticism of U.S.
It appeared in an article in
New York “Herald Tribune,”
which adds:
“Since the aggression in
Korea, about $lO billion has
been appropriated to strengthen
Western Europe against renewed
aggression, the bulk of this
money for arms. Of this great
sum, only about $1.4 billion
worth of weapons has actually
been delivered to this country’s
[America’s] Western Allies. And
much even of this comparatively
miserable sum represents arms
from surplus stocks in the United
States and in Germany.”
Speaking of it as “a record of
abysmal failure,” the article also
comments:
“This is having a deeply
dangerous effect throughout the
Western alliance. As Winston
Churchill told the British Parlia-
ment recently, British rearma-
ment has been delayed for at
least a year because, although
‘there is no question of reproach
on either side,’ Great Britain ‘has
not received aid in keeping with
our defence burden undertaken
by the late Prime Minister.’ The
effect on the other N.A.T.O.
partners is even more serious
than on the British, who produce
the great bulk of their own arms.
Arms promised for France and
other continental allies simply
have not been delivered.”
Arms-race Runners.
Describing it as “a strange
kind of arms-race” in which “it
begins to look as if only one
side is really running,” “U.S.
News and World Report” points
out that when Korea set the race
off (now getting on for two
“El Tiempo.” Bogota, Colombia.
“A PRETTY DOVE. TOO BAD IT HAS THIS ESCORT .”
years ago) Russia had the troops,
tanks and planes to sweep across
Europe and go deep into Asia.
Russia now has many more
tanks and planes—plus atom-
bombs ;
“The West, at the start, didn’t
even have enough to stop the in-
vasion of Korea or Indo-China,
let alone halt Soviet sweeps
across Europe or the Middle
East. The West, now, can hold
in Korea but not win, and still
lacks forces in being to turn
back a Soviet invasion of
Europe.
“As the West is running this
race: Britain is tiring on the
first lap, cutting its speed by a
third, taking four years to cover
a three-year course. France,
limping badly, has stumbled on
the first turn. Western Ger-
many, counted on heavily, isn’t
even in the race yet. U.S., far
out in front with the dollars,
appears to be talking a better
race than it is running.
“In London, Winston
Churchill complains that the
R.A.F. has no planes ready for
use like the U.S.’s F-86. British
arms-plants have trouble equip-
ping Britain’s four divisions in
Europe, three in Asia, three in
the Middle East. Goal —22
divisions equipped—looks far
off. In Paris, the official record
shows anus-production in 1951
at a rate of around 450 million
dollars, or about one per cent,
of France’s gross income. In
Washington, though dollar
totals for arms are astronomical,
it’s admitted the U.S. isn’t yet
turning out enough tanks or
planes for Korea, let alone
Indo-China and Western
Europe.
“The official boast is that the
Allies are producing four times
as much in arms as when Korea
started. The hard fact is that
this isn’t enough if the Allies are
to win the arms-race.”
Noting the tendency in
London and Paris to blame the
U.S. for lagging arms-output
[American critics also hit Uncle
Sam on this score], it quotes Mr.
Churchill to the effect that the
U.S., more than a year ago,
promised to send Britain 314
millipn dollars’ worth of
machine-tools, that delivery is
only beginning now, and that
the U.S. also promised 300
million in military aid for the
current year, but it hasn’t shown
up yet.
French officials it quotes to
the effect that last November
the U.S. agreed to give France
600 million in military and
economic aid for the current
fiscal year, most of which aid
is yet to come.
“The truth,” adds “U.S. News
and World Report,” “seems to
be that the West doesn’t really
want to rearm.”
Many More to Feed.
Emphasis by a London
“Times” special correspondent
on the British Commonwealth
countries’ large population
increases since the war signposts
probably the most important
single cause of the current food
shortage:
“In Britain itself the popula-
tion rose from 47,500,000 in
1938 to an estimated total of
50,600,000 in 1950, or by
approximately 6 per cent., but
this proportion was far out-
stripped by the increases of 21
per cent, in Canada, of 19 per
cent, in Australia and New
Zealand, of 23 per cent, in South
Africa, of 31 per cent, in Ceylon,
of 17 per cent, in the colonies
and of 50 per cent, in Southern
Rhodesia.
“If the Commonwealth’s
exports of food (of which the
major part comes to Britain)
have failed to increase by as
much as might have been
expected in the last few years,
the cause is readily understand-
able. All or nearly all of the
great food-exporting countries
of the Commonwealth have a
growing number of mouths to
feed at home.”
Britain’s food future, m the
circumstances, is seen as pre-
carious.
Various Voices.
Former Attlee Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Gaitskell: “Let
us have no illusions, without
America fully committed to the
defence of Western Europe we
could not withstand Russian
aggression, France and Italy,
rent with internal dissensions,
would collapse and the whole of
Europe would fall speedily
under Russian control. And if
anyone thinks that Russia would
not take advantage of such an
easy expansion, he had better go
and talk to Marshal Tito.”
British Home Secretary, Sir
David Maxwell Fyfe {at an
Institute of Actuaries’ dinner in
London) : “It is a tribute to the
actuarial profession that people
all over the world can feel secure
with their assurance policies in
British offices. Life-assurance
provides the largest single source
of personal savings in this
country today.”
British Minister of State,
Selwyn Lloyd: “As we [i.e.,
Britain] are so interested in the
European Defence Community,
you may ask whether it would
not be simpler and better for us
to become full members of it.
I think not. Our strength derives
from our position as centre of
the Commonwealth and sterling
area, and as the bridge in the
Atlantic community between the
continent of North America and
the continent of Europe. We
should forfeit this position if we
became simply one element in
the European community and
both they and we would be the
losers.”
Sir Hartley Shaw cross, M.P. :
“We should build up on
N.A.T.0., extending its member-
ship to the whole Commonwealth
and to all the free democracies.
We should enlarge its scope to
cover the economic problems of
peace as well as the serious
possibilities of war.”
U. Secretary of State,
Acheson: “The limitations on
the European economies are real
limitations. They cannot be
removed by exhortations or by
carping. The average citizen in
Western Europe has an income
about one-third that of the
average U.S. citizen. He pays
about the same percentage of
that meagre income in taxes.”
V. A. Grantham, chairman of
the Chartered Bank of India,
Australia and China: “The
plain fact of the matter is that
Great Britain must live within
its income. In other words,
Great Britain is taking more out
of the common pool than it is
putting into it. This position
can only be rectified by putting
more into the pool and/or by
taking less out, which means
working harder and /or lowering
the standard of living.”

Haddon Rig Sires more than measure up to
the most exacting standards set by stud
breeders and growers. The steadily increasing
demand for them is much more than a tribute
to seventy years of achievement; it is an
acknowledgment that Haddon Rig Sires are a
very sound investment.
Raised on the open plains, Haddon Rig Stud
Rams are hardy and robust. True to type,
they possess all the essential qualities—
massive frames, true conformations, dense,
soft-handling wool and high lambing percen-
tages—together with the ability to transmit
all these invaluable characteristics.
Haddon Rig’s remarkable record at the
Sydney Ram Sales is striking confirmation of
the Stud’s peerless reputation. Over the last
12 years, Haddon Rig has averaged over 25%
of the total proceeds of all Merino Rams sold
by auction. Last year’s top aggregate—
£3B,377 —was again taken by Haddon Rig for
the twelfth successive year.

SUNDRY SHOWS
BROWNLEE.
John Brownlee, the greatest
male singer Melbourne has pro-
duced, came back the other
evening to Melbourne Town
Hall, where he hasn’t been heard
for 20 years, and sang to so
many empty seats that the
acoustics were affected. This is
a common phenomenon at the
Melbourne Town Hall and has
bewildered many virtuosos. To
ascribe any lack of tone in the
singing to the singer and not to
the acoustics would be adding
injustice to impoliteness, because
it seemed very -impolite of Mel-
bourne to absent itself in large
numbers from a concert by its
most distinguished singer.
There is no reason to suppose
that it wasn’t a more mature,
more experienced and probably
better singer who stepped on to
the platform to receive this icy
greeting, or that he had ever set
himself a severer programme.
A delightful panel of French
songs, including “L’Hiver,” some
sturdy Purcell, Schubert and
Schumann, an aria from Mehul’s
opera “Ariodant” and
Papageno’s Song from “The
Magic Flute” were sung with the
customary Brownlee polish and
delicacy of shading. Raymond
Lambert gave the customary
good account of himself at the
piano.
The city made amends for its
early neglect by rolling up for
Brownlee’s second and final con-
cert, and giving the baritone a
warm reception, to which he re-
sponded with the most sustained
burst of relaxed singing that has
been heard in that place for a
very long time, and looking as
merry the while as his first song,
Bach’s “Good Fellows.”
Then followed five songs from
Schumann’s Dichterliebe,
sensitively rendered, and to show
that there was plenty of cricket
in him, he let his voice range
through ditties as widely
different in mood and character
as “The Statue of Tsarkoe” by
Cui and the rollicking drinking
song of Ravel. His last gift was
a bunch of lovely British folk-
songs.
"Don Giovanni."
Before being dragged down
by devils amid smoke and flame
to the Tophet for which he so
worthily qualified (admirably
stage-managed, this), John
Brownlee—as the gay libertine
who left a trail of betrayed
women in his wake, but did it in
so gay, insouciant and melodious
a manner as to make his pecca-
dilloes seem not unattractive—
sang of his amorous triumphs
with unexceptionable diction —
so essential if the audience is
to get the full benefit of Lorenzo
da Ponte’s witty libretto.
This was the Brownlee whom
concert audiences did not see —
the trained actor, in costume,
moving with practised ease.
His was a more mature, subtle
lover than the alternative Don,
John Young, who nevertheless
cut a dashingly youthful figure,
Alan Eddy’s Commandatore and
John Dudley’s Ottavio were ex-
cellent.
A surprisingly good piece of
buffoonery was put on by
Raymond Beatty, who, as
Leporello, sang the Catalogue
aria capitally. Betty Hooper’s
Zerlina was a charming piece of
coquettishness. Phyllis Rogers,
as Donna Anna, had too many
anxious moments in the high
reaches of her voice—sometimes
the note wasn’t quite reached.
Stefan Haag, whose production
was lively and imaginative, was
the oafish Masetto. John Rowell
spread himself handsomely in
the decor, and his costumes had
authenticity and richness. Joseph
Post conducted.
Dunlop Contes
The number of arrived and
struggling - to - arrive Australian
artists who tried to get in on
Dunlop Rubber’s latest annual
Australian art contest was as-
tounding. Less than a tenth of
the pictures submitted escaped
the screening of judges Daryl
Lindsay, Will Ashton and R.
Malcolm Warner and reached
their temporary Valhalla, Tye’s
Gallery, in Bourke-street, but
they were enough to fill the four
walls. The scope of the contest
was increased this year by the
division of prizes into separate
sections, and prizes were awarded
for oils and watercolors.
First award for oils went to
Harold Thomas Greenhill for
his “Homes on Manly Point,” an
affair of beach and houses after
the manner of Cezanne but
without the quality of that
master, the second to Murray
Griffin for “The Shearer,” a
piece of rather blatant illustra-
tion in which shearer, shorn,
fleece, flesh and clothing all
differ in color but are all of the
same texture, and third to
“Summer at Kanmantoo,” by
Charles Bush, a slick view of a
wheatfield with farming imple-
ments filling up the foreground.
Fourth award for oils went to
Reginald Rowed for a dark
study of the Wilson Hall after
its immolation.
There was no first award for
watercolors, the second going
to W. R, F. Richardson for a
limpid sketch, “The Dry Cross-
ing,” and the third to Max Rag-
less for a sketch of Hobart.
Unplaced foi no apparent
reason were Ludmilla Meilerts’s
bright “Street in Melbourne,”
Jack L. Koskie’s “Eden, N.S.W.”
and Lawrence M. Daws’s smoky
rooftops in “Hawthorn Coach-
house.”
Abstract Circus.
Robert Klippel’s “construc-
tions” at Sydney Macquarie
Galleries, towers and convolu-
tions of bits of wood painted in
bright reds and blues, look like
wedding - cakes, lift - wells,
skeletons of Christmas - trees,
skyrockets, abstract essences of
paper-flowers, toy xylophones
with their mallets, frameworks
of modern architecture, stands
of toothpicks, merry-go-rounds,
circus-tents and meccano: and,
as decorations for the nursery or
even curiosities for a modern
flat, with the basic “disquiet” of
surrealism here modified to mere
playfulness and ingenuity, they
may be found quite pleasing.
Some of Ralph Balson’s
abstract pastels, keeping com-
pany with the “constructions,”
also have a decorative quality,
smoother and softer in color,
like designs for fabrics or wall-
paper ; but Mr. Balson’s large
patchwork oils, with their little
oblongs of red on the immense
squares of grey, have always
looked like the most fantastic
waste of time to this reviewer,
and still do. Wyndham Lewis
himself said the abstractionists
were trapped in a cul-de-sac.
In the N.S.W. finals of the
A.B.C. Vocal and Concerto
Competition Marjorie Conley
was an easy choice in the sing-
ing section, her rendering of
“Una Voce” from “The Barber
of Seville,” with her naturally
pure coloratura easily surmount-
ing all the chordal acrobatics,
putting her well ahead of her
rival, James Harris, who spoiled
what chance he had by declining
the written high note towards
the end of the Prologue to
“Pagliacci” in favor of a lower
one. Rainer von Zastrow made
himself also the logical choice
for the instrumental section with
a forceful and musicianly inter-
pretation of the First Movement
from Brahms’s Concerto No. 2,
also the selection of Vladimir
Pleshakov, who, like James
Harris, was commended. Ronald
Woodcock, also commended,
played part of the Sibelius Violin
Concerto with no little musical
insight but at times a rather dry
tone,
* * * *
The Queensland section of the
A.B.C.’s Annual Concerto and
Vocal Concert was disappointing
this year, and the judges made
no secret of their opinion. There
did not seem to be much to
choose between Margaret
Stinson’s winning performance
of the first and second move-
ments of the Beethoven second
piano concerto and Jill Barrie’s
Mozart, but perhaps the lack of
distinct crispness in the latter
told against her. The judges
had some difficulty in deciding
between Judith Mycock’s sing-
ing of Dinorah’s “Shadow
Song” and Keith Mann’s spirited
version of “Honor and Arms”
by Handel, Both artists when
at their best showed distinct
promise, and both were marred
by uneven and woolly tones at
times. John Farnsworth Hall,
conducting the Queensland
Symphony Orchestra, seemed
most co-operative with the
young artists, but the orchestra
was guilty of occasional lapses.
* ♦ * *
There was a time, almost
within the memory of our elders,
when the tragedy of “Maria
Marten,” foully done to death
in the Red Barn, was received
seriously, yet when the Queens-
land University Dramatic
Society presented the classic
melodrama several nights ago it
raised more laughs than a film
revival or a fashion show.
Although few of the cast were
able to remain within the spirit
and style of acting the piece re-
quired, the two principals, Peter
Munro and Shirley McCorkin-
dale as the villain and the
innocent girl, gave excellent per-
formances, evoking in turn sym-
pathy and hisses from the
audience. Against the passages
of high seriousness that the
passing of time has transformed
into comedy, the orignal comic
relief now appears as merely
boring and should have been
pruned. That would have saved
on the excessive number of
scene-changes and would have
allowed the audience to be
abed before midnight.

Not since the end of 1946, when the
co.’s £1 shares were jammed at the
official ceiling level of 68s. 3d., has the
scrip—one of the “blue-chip” stocks in
the market —been available at lower
prices than those prevailing during the
last couple of months. A year ago the
figure stood at 87s. 6d., ex new issue ;
it had fallen to 60s. early in April last,
and then strengthened to 68s. following
publication of the latest accounts. At 68s.
the immediate return is 3.7 p.c. on a
12i p.c. div. basis. The investor who
looks for, say, 4.5 p.c. on his money
therefore counts on a 15 p.c. distribution,
or other benefits.
The div., steady at 10 p.c. for the 29
years to 1948, was lifted to \\\ p.c. in
1949 and to 12i p.c. in the following
year and has remained steady since. The
capital account has moved this way since
1911; —

At March 31, 1952, there was still
£266,004 to come on the last issue. Issued
capital thus stands at £3,000,000, on which
12|- p.c. will call for £375,000, or £33,125
less profit than the cautious board claimed
last term.
In order of profitability the three main
divisions of the big organisation are
merchandising, investments and shipping ;
and activities spread throughout the
Commonwealth and New Zealand, out
over the south-west Pacific and north to
New Guinea and Singapore. There is
also a branch in London and another in
San Francisco.
Bigger trading and rising prices bumped
up merchandising turnover last term, and
better returns from investments and
shipping contributed to the pool, too.
The improvement in gross earnings was
£414,835, or 15.5 p.c.: —

* Includes taxation.
Working exes., mainly salaries, wages and
provision for taxation, gobbled the gain
and £4660 besides. It was the lower but
still liberal allowance for depreciation
(£375,044, down £27,243) that put the
spring of £22,441 in the final profit figure,
lifting it to £408,125. That was equal to
17.2 p.c. on average capital compared with
19.3, 18.1, 17.2, 16.4 and 15 p.c. back to
1947. It leaves out of the reckoning a net
unexplained reduction of £85,380 in the
insurance and sundry branch and other
reserves (now £2,950,136). A year ago
the chairman said part of these reserves
might be used to write down the cost
(£A692,000) of the new 3750-ton island
cargo vessel Makekula, which was com-
pleted early in 1952. Over the years there
has been more wheat in the ear than the
eye could see, as disclosure of £717,819
of inner reserves in 1949 suggests.
The holding in subsidiaries (£2,520,544)
was increased by £330,142 during the
year. Principal offshoots are Burns Philp
(South Seas), Burns Philp (New Hebrides)
and Burns Philp (New Guinea). The
parent also owns a big and flourishing
chain-store business operating in Queens-
land and northern N. S. Wales under the
name of Penneys. Since the close of
accounts, this section of the organisation
has been passed to a wholly-owned sub-
sidiary, Penneys, Ltd., which has a paid
capital of £2,000,000 —in size it thus ranks
next after Wool worths and Coles.
Sundry shareholdings and Government
securities (£978,964) were reduced by
£630,142. The shares consist mainly of
scrip in Queensland Insurance, Bankers
and Traders’ Insurance, and in a string of
country and suburban stores in N. S.
Wales—the latter interests were acquired
mostly since the war.
Another inter-island trading vessel of
2500 tons has been ordered in Scotland
for delivery in August, 1954, at an esti-
mated cost of £A440,000. One of the
older vessels, the Morinda, has been with-
drawn from service and is now for sale.
It is doubtful whether the shipping
section, once a handsome contributor to
the pool, now earns an adequate return
on the capital involved. It is, however, an
indispensable link with the outposts of the
organisation.
The feature of balance-sheet figures is
the growth in working capital, or trading
assets:

This well-handled organisation was
established by the enterprising Wunder-
lichs in the 1880’s, and has been
developed by them, and the team they
gathered around them, into the largest
and most successful thing of its kind in
the Commonwealth. From factories in
all States the co. and its associates feed
the building and construction trades with
terra-cotta roofing tiles, architectural
facings, asbestos-cement (durabestos)
sheets, shop fronts and pressed-steel par-
titions, etc.
Since it took over the business
in 1908 the co. has never failed to
pay a div. Post-war demand has run well
ahead of expanding production, which
has been hampered by shortages of
materials, labor, transport, electric-power,
etc.; and adequate housing remains a
problem which a constant flow of
migrants will accentuate.
It is doubtful whether the present
curb on building through the tighten-
ing of credit will do much more
than reduce the long delays that
have occurred between order and
delivery dates. Looking ahead, the board
has planned erection of new factories and
extension and modernisation of old ones.
So that shareholders may know clearly
where they stand, the chairman, Alfred
Wunderlich, says the aim is to stabilise
the div., if possible, at 10 p.c. for some
years to come, and to finance capital
commitments out of surplus earnings and
a £500,000 loan arranged “on favorable
terms” with the A.M.P. Society—only
£220,000 of the money had been drawn
at Feb. 29, 1952. It is a sound long-term
policy which should enhance the value of
the ord. scrip as a holding proposition.
Last term’s bigger output from ex-
tended plant more than offset the effects
of rising costs, etc., and net earnings
benefited by £20,406, reaching a record
£147,963. That was after allowing
£91,335 (up £18,986) for depreciation and
unspecified amounts for taxation and pos-
sible fluctuations in stock-values, as well
as for the div. (£7310) on staff partners’
certificates. The £147,963 was enough to
pay the pref. divs. (£11,200) and show an
attractive 24.9 p.c. on the £547,633 of
ord. capital as against 21.2, 18.9, 19.1,
17.6 and 11.9 p.c. back to 1947. Of the
10 p.c. div. 1 p.c. was tax-free. That left
£81,999 (55.4 p.c. of the year’s net earn-
ings) to plough back into the business,
of which £22,650 was passed to the staff-
partners’ fund, etc. (now £152,750), which
is non-contributory and on which a 5 p.c,
div. is paid. As an incentive to a loyal,
efficient and contented staff, this partner-
ship scheme —the foundations of which
were laid by the late Dr. Otto Wunder-
lich —is said to be working well.
Expansion is the outstanding feature of
balance-sheet figures:

The year’s net addition to plant was
£206,383, largely on account of new tile-
works at Northgate, near Brisbane, which
came into production after the close of
last accounts. Stocks increased by
£129,299 and book debts by £73,095. To
meet the outlay the co. raised the
£220,000 already referred to on mortgage
from the A.M.P. and increased the
amount coming to sundry creditors, etc.,
by £66,814.
Asa backing to its efforts to increase
production and reduce costs the co. has
provided its workers with the most
modern plant and equipment available.
Still, it would be folly indeed to suppose
that all we need do is sit down and wait
for the managerial revolution to solve all
our difficulties. Labor must make its
contribution, too. One very effective way
in which it could help to further increase
output, reduce costs and counter infla-
tion is by working a longer week. Our
present boasted standard of living, with
all sorts of concessions, amenities and
social services, cannot be justified by
either our present efforts or earning-
capacity.

The level of earnings of those engaged in
the raw-sugar industry depends mainly
upon seasons, prices, costs and the ton-
nage of raw sugar exported. The three
seasons to the end of 1950 were among
the best in the history of the Queensland
sugar-belt. Last year drought and
severe winter frosts stalked the land,
especially south of Townsville. That
meant lighter crushings of cane, reduced
output of raws, a smaller export surplus
and higher unit costs, which were also
bumped up by increases in wage-rates,
prices for raw materials and transport
and handling charges.
The average price received per ton of
raws is the combined result of sales on
both local and export markets. In good
seasons roughly half the raws produced
are exported to the U.K. under a Gov-
ernment bulk-buying contract, and they
have fetched around £5 a ton more than
the price received in the home market,
where the figure is fixed, under a com-
plicated formula, by agreement between
the Federal and Queensland Govern-
ments. The tonnage exported is there-
fore an important factor in the average
price. Indeed, returns from exports have
largely taken care of the steep rise in
post-war wage, raw-material and other
costs in the industry. The average price
for the 1950 season was £27 16s. per
ton. The 1951 figure has not yet been
announced, but is expected to be not less
than £34.
Gibson and Howes operates as both
grower and miller in the Bundaberg
district; and the co.’s plantations are fed
by an efficient irrigation system, which
considerably mitigates the effects of
drought. Hence the co.’s output of raws
last season was only 9385 tons lower
at 23,980 tons. The higher average price
helped to soften the blow from this and
other sources. So, after setting aside
something for taxation and cutting the
allowance for depreciation (£17,597) by
£7297, the drop in net earnings was only
£9965. The £38,795 of profit claimed
was 11.8 p.c. on average capital as against
17.4, 18.6, 25.9 and 14.2 p.c. back to
1947. The distribution was lowered from
12 p.c. to 11 p.c., and the £2696 that
remained lifted free reserves to £187,904.
In addition there is a depreciation re-
serve of £360,073.
The outlook for the industry is one of
growing demand in both its markets. The
new eight-year sugar-pact with the U.K.
provides for the export of 600,000 tons
raws p.a., or 200,000 tons more than
formerly. The Central Cane Board has
lifted individual mill peaks accordingly,
and the cos. are installing additional plant
and equipment to handle the extra ton-
nage. To help meet the cost G. and H.
issued 140,000 new £1 ords. at par in
November, 1950. When all the money is in
—£84,138 was still to come at the close
of last accounts —paid capital will be
£420,000, on which 12 p.c. would call
for only £1640 more profit than was
earned in 1950.
As for the current term, the drought
has broken, but crushings are expected to
fall a little short of the 1951 figure. Also
costs have overtaken the home-
consumption price again; so millers and

Higher metal prices—London
1951 averages per ton were lead
£5163.7 (up £555.5) and zinc
£5171.7 (up £551.4) —better pro-
duction of ore and concentrates
and the increased earnings and
distributions of subsidiary and
associated cos. enabled Con-
solidated Zinc Corp. to nearly
double its declared net profit and
pay a higher div. for 1951:

The lift in the div. from \l\

is labelled bonus, fitted in pretty
well with market anticipations.
U.K. income tax and exchange
make the 20 p.c. worth 13.1 p.c.
in Australian currency. Still, the
price of the co.’s f.-p. £1 shares
(Australian market) fell from
41s. 6d. in Dec., 1951, to 295. 6d.
last week. That was because the
market for the shares follows the
market for the metals. Last
week the London average per ton
was lead £SI29 and zinc £SI66.
Six months ago the figures were
£S 176.5 and £SI9O respectively.
The Australian fixed price for
each metal remains unchanged
at £A6S per ton, and has done
so since Sept, 1950.
New Broken Hill Consoli-

Women's Letters
From Sydney
Wool Week, which begins today, isn’t
officially a woman’s affair, but the social
engagements listed this year seem to
make it so. There is to be a cocktail
party at the Showground today given by
members of the N.S.W. Sheep Breeders’
Association, also a dinner dance at the
Pickwick for the British sheepbreeders.
Tonight is the annual ball at the Troc.
of one of the biggest wool firms. There’s
the Wool Ball on Saturday at Romano’s,
a cocktail party on Sunday, and George
Falkiner’s party at the Pickwick Club on
this-day-week. Add to this the manne-
quin parade of wool clothes at the
Showground and you have ample excuse
for making a trip to Sydney for Wool
Week “an absolute necessity.”
If the pen is indeed mightier than the
sword, the ties between England and
America should be growing stronger with
each year, for Professor Bruce Suther-
land, speaking at the P.E.N. Club during
the week, said that for every American
who studies his own literature nine study
English literature, as opposed to five who
study Italian, six French and four Latin.
The study of Greek has practically died
out in American universities, said the
Professor, but Russian is being taken
more seriously than American. Professor
Sutherland, who has been studying Aus-
tralian on a Fulbright scholarship, and
who returns to America shortly, led a
stimulating discussion at this club meet-
ing, mainly on the topic of American
literature. The Max Affords were among
the listeners and talkers, also that G.O.M.
Sir Robert Garran, poet Nancy Keesing,
writers Nourma Handford, Gladys Lister,
Mrs. B. Muscio and Madame Baja, who
said she was not a writer, but was
interested “on the consumer side.”
“Fodgie,” of Lower North Adelaide,
takes exception to this Letter’s reference
to “swinging along in the barn-dance to
the strains of ‘Sweet Rosie O’Grady’ and
the like,” adding “It would be rather
quaint to find oneself in a barn-dance
swinging along to the time of a waltz.”
Now, Fodgie, that’s fudging! In
N.S.W., at any rate, it’s quite common
for the barn-dance to go through four
stages, first to the usual tempo, second
the progressive stage (change partners),
third swing to waltz-time, fourth finish
with march-time. It may not be a true
barn-dance, but it’s good fun, although
rather exhausting if one is over 18.
It was really wonderful to see the large
numbers of music-lovers who went along
to hear young Viennese pianist Paul
Badura-Skoda. Sydney people must
already have spent a fortune on the con-
certs of Gieseking and be breaking
into their money-boxes for the National
Opera, but they still seem to be willing
to forgo something else to hear a really
brilliant musician such as this.
In town this week for a few days is
Mrs. E. M, Anderson, from Fortrose,
Ross-shire, in the highlands of Scotland.
Sponsored by the Imperial Relations
Trust, Mrs. Anderson aspires to “do” the
whole of Australia (Northern Territory,
Alice Springs, all the States) in six months
and to return full of information about
us to her home. Judging by the energy
with which she took in and moved from
function to function in Sydney, her plan
seems quite feasible. She did say (in a
charming Scots voice) that everyone asks
her questions here, whereas what she
wants to do is to listen. Interested in
the Women’s Rural Institutes in Scotland,
Mrs. Anderson has, in Australia, been
taken under the wing of the C.W.A.,
which has prepared an impressive itinerary
for her and attended to all the details,
so that she will have all the more time
for “listening to us” and finding out all
about us.
The Lyrebird Writers, under the
auspices of the W.E.A., have arranged
to have a series of 10 lunch-hour poetry
recitals which will begin at 1.10 p.m.
on June 10 and each successive Tuesday
after that. The poetry is all from Aus-
tralian writers —the readers listed are
J. D. B. Miller, Roland Robinson and
Muir Holburn. The fee for the full
series is 10s., which includes tea “for
those members wishing to eat their lunch
during the readings.” This seems to be
about the best value noted to date in
this inflationary age. The place of meet-
ing is St. James Hall, 161 Phillip-street.
Remember the Baby-Louis heel? Well,
it’s coming back into fashion again after
being regarded for years as quaint or
silly. There are several examples in the
high-style department of one of our lead-
ing stores, where it is shown in satin and
suede. Heels are quite in the fashion
news all round (heels on shoes that is,
not human heels), because of their really
glamorous trimmings, diamente and
beading. Satin shoes are becoming more

Here is an interesting note trom a
reader about Alice Guerin Crist, one ot
Australia’s few women ballad-writers,
“Years ago readers of the Brisbane
Catholic Advocate used to look forward
to the weekly verses contributed by Alice
Guerin Crist. Some readers of the old
Home Budget’ may also remember her
wor k, a few examples of which weie also
printed in the Bulletin. I was reminded
tl.lhe other day when, in the Sydney
Municipal Library, I came across a copy
er book, When Rody Came to Iron-
bark and Other Verses. It was a nostalgic
pleasure to renew acquaintance with ner
tuneful simple accounts of pioneering life
anc * the people who lived it. I wondei
h° w many people remember, for instance,
D Shea, the big lailway ganger who
never intended to shock pious people
when he d say. Aw, glong, go-to-he!l,
go-to-hell now in a mildly expostulant
wa /- Very charming period pieces these,
This cheery face belongs to Margaret
Waddell, daughter of Sir Graham and
Lady Waddell, who has just been
appointed Honorary Director of Branches
for the Red Cross. Miss Waddell served
with the A.A.M.W.S. during the war,
spending two years with the 2/ Ist A.G.H.
in Bougainville, Rabaul and New Britain,
She has been a member of the V.A.D.
since 1939 and was associated with the
Red Cross branches in the Cootamundra
district, where she formerly lived. In
her new job she will have 608 branches
throughout the Stale in her charge.
Nearly every visitor to Sydney com-
ments on the way we don’t use our
harbor, and we mostly agree that it’s a
shame. The new bus-and-ferry transport
from the North Side which begins this
week should fix all that. Willy-nilly
people are being forced to take to harbor
travel, and mostly they object. It will
be interesting to see, however, whether
there is a noticeable increase in good
temper from those “over the water.”
There is no doubt that that little quiet
space of water-travel at the end of the
day does a lot to smooth out city-worry-
lines and to send one home more amiable
than if one had travelled by a crowded,
noisy train or tram.
Rose-planting time brings to mind the
general lack of romance there is in the
names of this exquisite flower. Really,
nylon stockings get more glamorous
names. “Madame Butterfly” is fair, but
how prosaic are “Picture, Editor McFar-
land, Warrawee, E. G. Hill, Apricot
Queen, Texas Centennial.” Etoile de
Hollande is better but hard to say, while
Goldilocks and Pinocchio have pleasant
associations yet seem somehow inap-
propriate. We have it on the authority of
Shjakspeare that a rose will smell as
sweet under any other name. Still, it
wouldn’t look the same.
The opera premieres continue to be
somewhat brilliant assemblies. The past
weeks saw the opening nights of “Caval-
leria Rusticana,” “Pagliacci” and “Don
Giovanni.” Mr. and Mrs. Vernon Treatt
were present on Wednesday, also the
Minister for Education and Mrs. Heffron,
Mr. and Mrs. E. O’Dea (they certainly do
get around), the Erik Langkers (Mrs.
Langker wearing a lovely flowery printed
white organdie), and the Carl Lorenzes.
Mrs. Lorenz wore a full-length opera coat
of gold brocade. Of the younger set the
most consistent first-nighter is perhaps
Margaret Daniel, who is seen at nearly
every opening—musical, ballet or opera.
From Melbourne
Empire Day was celebrated by the
young contingent of the Victoria League
in Victoria with a late-afternoon party
at which 120 guests were received by
Mrs. Basil Dunn, Doris Bell and Jim
Brock in the absence of president
Marjorie Tatnall. A bowl of red, white
and blue flowers was set in the reception-
rooms. The loyal toast was proposed by
Air-Vice-Marshal G. Harcourt-Smith,
R.A.F., who was accompanied by his
wife. Official guests included Sir Norman
and Lady Mighell, she wearing a rasp-
berry-red wool ensemble and matching
hat; Mrs. lan Connell, whose black
cloth jacket-suit was worn with a jade-
green felt cloche; Mr. and Mrs. John
Casson and Jimmy Hanley; Adrienne
Maxwell, whose pretty watermelon-pink
tent-coat was worn over a black frock;
Margaret Bain, who chose a black jersey
jacket-suit; Joan Nesbitt, who highlighted
her junior-blue coat with a scarlet felt
cloche banded with gold embroidery;
Garda Tinker in a high-necked long-
sleeved black jersey top and a full skirt
of gunmetal velvet with jet embroidery
at the hips ; and Vicki Cook, whose suit
of tiny black-and-white checks had for
company a pillarbox-red hat.
The attractive lass pictured here is
Elizabeth Anne Spraggett, who has just
been appointed secretary-companion to
the Governor’s wife. Lady Brooks. She
is the only daughter of Colonel R. W.
Spraggett, private secretary to the
Governor, and Mrs. Spraggett. Educated
in England, Anne, who has a variety of
interests, including music, is tall and
slender, and has a winning personality.
Lovely pink, bronze and yellow
crysanthemums, red berries and yellow
iris made gay the South Yarra residence
of Henry E. Stebbins, Consul-General
for the U.S.A., and Mrs. Stebbins when
they gave a late-afternoon party for the
recently-arrived American public-rela-
tions officer, Joseph W. Thoman, and
Mrs. Thoman. The hostess wore an
ankle-length frock of garnet-red faille
with jet embroidery set in the centre of
the off-the-shoulder bodice and on the
bracelet-length sleeves. Mrs. Thoman’s
full-skirted and sleeveless dress of
benedictine-grey paper-shantung was
worn over a stiffened petticoat. Among
the 200 invited were the Archbishop of
Melbourne, Dr. J. J. Booth, and Mrs.
Booth, the Chief Justice of the High
Court of Australia, Sir Owen Dixon,
and Lady Dixon, Sir John and Lady
Latham, Sir Charles and Lady Lowe and
Sir John Medley, With the Lord Mayor,
Cr. O. J. Nilsen, was his daughter, the
Lady Mayoress, Mrs. John Inkster, whose
cocktail frock of black-and-pastel-blue
embroidered faille was worn with a large
black hat.
The Consul for China, T. Liu, was with
his wife, who wore a gold satin gown
heavily patterned in multicolored
flowers and silver-fox cape. Mrs. Garnet
Carroll added a tiny white ermine cravat
to her black coat, and matched it with
a tiny white ermine muff; her black hat
was wide-brimmed. With Captain R.
Denbo, the U.S. Naval Attache, was Mrs.
Denbo and their daughter Wayne, whose
black taffeta frock had very full sleeves
of white organdie. With the Herbert
Allens was their goddaughter, Angela
Barrington, and with Conrad Charlton,
of the A.8.C., was Mrs. Charlton. Mrs,
F. P. Callahan topped her junior-blue
jacket-suit with a dusty-pink cloche
embellished with gold sequins. Mrs. E.
Daum’s black satin frock featured a
pleated skirt and was worn with an
osprey-trimmed black hat. With Captain
Charles Burge was his wife, whose B°ld-
toned cloche was worn with a black frock
and mink coat.
When things are missing from her
home Mrs. F. W. Hiring never worries—
she knows where they’ll be. When the
curtain rose at the Arrow Theatre on the
opening night of “The Man Who Came
to Dinner” it was not surprising to her to
see many of the pieces on stage. Her
son Frank stars in this Moss Hart play
as Sheridan Whiteside and gives a fine
performance. So does Professor Keith
Macartney, who portrays Beverly
Carlton, In the big audience was Mrs.
G. Schweig, from Sydney, whose beige
wool coat had a huge lynx-fur collar.
She was with her daughter, Mrs. Maurice
Copolov, who as Pearl Sweig is often seen
in productions at the Arrow and Little
Theatres.
Myra Roper, principal of the Univer-
sity Women’s College, was guest-speaker
at the Australian-American Association
Women’s Group monthly meeting,
held at the Delphic. The speaker
delighted her audience with her com-
ments, serious and otherwise, on univer-
sity and college life as she saw it on her
recent extensive tour through the U.S.A.,
where she visited and stayed at many of
the seats of learning. Mrs. R. G. Casey,
president of the Women’s Group, was in
the chair. Also in the record attendance
were past-president Mrs. Rupert Downes,
Mrs. Boyce Gibson, Mrs. T. Spensley and
Mesdames Gladys Myer, Rufus Ramey
and S. F. Rowell. Plans for the Coral
Sea Ball were also discussed at the meet-
ing. This function will be held on June 6
at the Roy ale Ballroom, and the U.S.
Ambassador Pete Jarman and Mrs. Jar-
man will come specially from Canberra.
One of the features of the ball will be
a dance performed by hula maidens.
Decorative motif will be tropical. There
are still a few tables to be booked with
Mrs. J. Paxton (8J2825).
Delegates from every corner of the
State have been in this city for the House-
wives’ Association’s general conference.
The acting-president, Mrs. Gladys Hain,
M.A., LL.B., presided. The annual
report showed that the association has
been busy with its objections to cost of
living and inflation. In fact, it has
fought the battle of the housewife in every
way. And, as a means to an end, a recipe
was given to every delegate and member
of the Housewives’ Association.
This recipe, a substitute for meat, is a
potato-cheese-and-tomato pie. It takes
11b. potatoes, 1 dessertspoon butter, 3oz.
shredded processed cheese, seasoning,
chopped chives or onions and milk. Boil
potatoes in skins till tender, peel and
mash with butter, cheese (shredded), salt
and pepper and enough milk to make
creamy but not too moist. Line an oven-
proof dish with potato, sprinkle with
cheese and brown under griller or in oven
for a few minutes. Place halved toma-
toes, cut side up, in the pie, sprinkle
with seasoning, shredded cheese and some
chopped chives or spring onions and put
back under griller or in oven until
tomatoes are heated through and lightly
tinted on top. This dish, says the associa-
tion, has good food-value, is successful
as a vegetable or main course and is very
good for children.
Though the winds of winter swept the
city, in the warm salon of Douglas Cox
mannequins brought a foretaste of spring
and summer. Here were the gay cottons,
the filmy silks and chiffons, the satins and
tie-silks —all made-up in the latest over-
seas trends. This young Flinders-lane
fashion-artist has presented for the first
time in this country a selection of
Jacqmar filament silks in lovely flower-
prints, and in prints which tell the story
of ballet, opera, poetry and drama. Most
important is a new poplin everglaze, a
cotton with a silk finish which, because
of its softness, allows for draping in many
ways. Cotton patterned in polka-dots or
stripes, a new shantung, “Dupion,” which
has a slub finish, and a striped seersucker
are among the newest fabrics. The full
skirt is the one for the coming season.
The theme of this collection is “breadth
without thickness,” and the slim silhouette
is presented from front to back, with side
width accentuated.
Hips are emphasised by pockets, side-
panels (often pleated) or by fullness,
drapery and pannier effects in the more
formal dresses. Bodices are moulded and
uncluttered, but soft draping and tucking
often continues through to the skirt. The
soft sleeve, which widens at the elbow
and gives a batwing effect at the back, is
the obvious balance to the wider hip-line
and tends further to minimise the waist-
line. Colors are mostly soft and delicate,
among them being play-green, peacock,
limeade-green, dream-blue, true-blue,
cocktail-yellow, sweetcorn, sun-yellow,
chiffon and sandstorm-beige, pago-pink,
foam-pink, platinum, salute-blue (navy),
rave-red, black and all shades of copper.

PERSONAI ITEMS
There seems to be some fertilising
quality about the Chair of Botany at
Sydney University. Two professors in
that field have already flowered from
there to sunnier things—Theodore Osborn
went to the Sherardian Chair of Botany
at Oxford, Eric Ashby to a botanical seat
at Manchester, before growing on to the
vice-chancellorship of Queen’s University,
Belfast. Now Norman Burges, Dean of
the science-faculty at Sydney ’Varsity as
well as botany professor, is off to the
University of Liverpool. Born at East
Maitland (N.S.W.), Burges had been at
Cambridge from 1934 to 1938 —in the
latter year elected a Fellow of
Emmanuel College. When Hitler began
sowing his harvest, Burges joined the
R.A.F.’s Bomber Command, a wing-
commander in the signal-branch. Forty,
he’s been botanising at Sydney University
since 1947.
Reginald John Bond, secretary of the
Westralian Housing Commission for the
past seven years, goes to the Under-
secretaryship of Metropolitan Water
Supply. With so many clamoring for
homes Bond has had his work cut out.
He’s managed to remain an efficient,
courteous administrator. Now he’ll have
one of the most peaceful jobs in the local
public service.
S. H. BEATTIE, V.C., of St. Nazaire.
(See page 6.)
“Ceg”: When young Frank Godden
stepped off the Orient Company’s pioneer
vessel Lusitania (half-steam —half-sail) at
Port Melbourne in 1883 and then joined
the Victoria Bowling Club at Carlton, he
couldn’t have thought he would still
be a devotee of the game close on 70
years later. Doyen of Melbourne antique
dealers, he must he the oldest playing
bowler in Victoria —possibly Australia.
He wears the medallion of the Royal
Victorian Bowling Association issued to
“Super Veterans” of the game, and plays
at the well-known Queenscliff Club.
He relinquished his gallery and show-
rooms in Queen-street some 10 years ago,
after having been under vice-regal
appointment to five State Governors from
Lord Brassey onwards. Antique-dealing
is in the blood ; he gained his London
experience with his father in Leicester
Square, brothers were also in it, and a
nephew is vice-president of the London
association. Now 92, Frank still rolls a
deadly black-’un.
Born 1882 and still rowing strong,
Westralia’s veteran oarsman, George
Rogers, who 31 years ago stroked West-
ralia’s record-breaking King’s Cup crew.
He still does his 12-mile rows, and in try-
outs never misses an exact 160 strokes
to the mile. Rogers laid the foundation
of a superb physique when, a boy in
London, he did gymnasium-work under
an instructor who had been trained by
Sandow.
The panel that selected John Joseph
Pritchard to be S. Australia’s Rhodes
Scholar for 1935 knew a thing or two.
Having gained his B.Sc. at 18, and the
degrees of B.M. and B.Ch. at Oxford
at the age of 24, Pritchard has been
appointed Professor of Anatomy at
Queen’s University, Belfast. In the Old
Country since his Oxford emergence, he
was on the medical staff of the Mill Hill
Emergency Hospital in London’s early
air-raid days, and while there was invited
to lecture at University College, London.
Educated at St. Peter’s, Adelaide Uni-
versity and St. Mark’s, he was the eighth
student of St. Mark’s to get a Rhodes
Scholarship.
“Conda”: Aboard an Australian cruiser
in the Pacific war a group of matelots
were watching an artist painting a scene
which took in the starb’d seaboat. The
respect sailors feel for any science they
don’t understand was heightened as they
watched the seaboat grow strake by
accurate strake on the canvas. “ ’Struth! ”
one whispered, “he’s even got the lay
of the ropes in the right direction.” One
of the few Australian artists who can
draw naval craft in a manner not likely
to make a catfish seasick, Frank Norton
got the lay of his subjects to such com-
petent degree that he was appointed, in
1941, the R.A.N.’s official war-artist.
New Zealand-born, he came to Australia
as an infant, studied at the East Sydney
Technical College under Fred Leist, and
is now on the teaching staff of that
college. In between, he did commercial-
poster and illustrative work, which
disciplined his powers and proved his
adaptability. The other day he was
appointed official naval war-artist in the
Korea area, with the temporary rank of
lieut.-commander.
“Jock”: I would like to substantiate,
from personal experience, “Oliver
Filter’s” assessment of Captain Noel
Chavasse (B. 30/4/’52). A medico
attached to the 1 / 10th Battalion, Liver-
pool Scottish, Chavasse won his first
Cross at Guillemont, on the Somme, in
August, 1916 ; the Bar to it in front of
Wieltje, in the Ypres sector, almost exactly
a year later. Here he was fatally
wounded. He was buried at Vlaman-
tinghe. The first man to receive the
Victoria Cross twice in one war (he won
M.C. as well, on the Ypres salient in
1915), Chavasse was highly regarded by
officers and men —there was never a man
who gave more unsparingly to the service
of others. A devout man himself, he
had for father Bishop Chavasse, the dis-
tinguished cleric of Liverpool.
Leslie C. Diver, who won the West-
ralian Central Province seat made vacant
by the death of former Minister for Agri-
culture G. B. Wood, is, like his prede-
cessor, a practical farmer, with first ex-
perience of the land in 1910. Then his
father and brothers were pioneering the
Yorkrakine district. Ten years later Diver
took up land on his own account, and
since 1938 has been sheepbreeding on
his Landale merino stud-farm, wheat-
growing, cattle- and pig-raising. President
of the Merredin and Districts Zone
Council of the Westralian Farmers’
Union, he has firsthand knowledge of
the province’s problems, but his political
pothooks were learnt during his seven
years’ chairmanship of the Kellerberrin
Road Board.
“Hamer”: Reg Allen, passed on at 93,
was last survivor of “The Allens”
noted in law, money, the inner-ring of
society (the one that avoids rather than
courts publicity), sport and the theatre.
To the general public Reg was best
known by the electric brougham in
which he used to travel about Sydney
right up to within a few years of his
death. Sons of Sir George Wigram Allen,
who built Toxteth Hall at Glebe, and
held a wide acreage of land extending
into adjacent suburbs, “the boys” showed
that the Australian revolt against im-
ported habits of life was general by
disposing of Toxteth and setting up their
own houses on less baronial lines, though
each of them probably became wealthier
than their parent. George Boyce went
to England and stayed there ; the Boyce
Allen who led an English cricket team
was his son. He, R. C. and Herbert were
great cricketers, pillars of strength to the
I Zingari team for years, and two had
intercolonial appearances: the cricket
enthusiasm was indicated by the legal
firm’s habit of allowing its staff rationed
holidays when big matches were being
played, without loss of pay. Reg and
Arthur became the greater financial part
of the J. C. Williamson firm ; their first
enthusiasm was the Broughs, whose tours
of Australia they financed. And all of
them were great racing men, Reg being
probably the longest-service committee-
man of the A.J.C.
Honorary membership of the compara-
tive medicine section of the Royal Society
of Medicine, London —the first to be
awarded to a Westralian —goes to Dr.
H. W. Bennetts, director of the animal
health and nutrition laboratory of the
Westralian Agricultural Department. A
serious-looking scientist whose height has
been reduced to an inch or so above six
feet by a scholar’s stoop, he earned the
distinction by his knowledge of animal
diseases. Among these was his discovery,
in 1929, of the cause of entero-toxaemia
in sheep, and the development of a pre-
ventive vaccine which saved pastoralists
thousands. Other successful work took in
toxic paralysis in sheep, rickets in lambs,
and falling-disease in cattle.
The Bulletin called on Monsignor
Hartigan (“John O’Brien” of the boree-
log) at the Rose Bay convent, that lovely
pile rearing its massive, weathered sand-
stone on the heights overlooking the
Sydney flying-boat base, to find a stooped,
silver-haired giant with a fixture of a
cigarette-holder jutting from a jaw like a
kauri-stump, a wise, kindly eye and a
large respect for the Red Page. The talk
lingered pleasantly on the wheel-bases
and speeds of cars (Hartigan was the
second priest in Australia to own one);
on paintings (the convent owns a fine set
of prints of the masters); on ships and
their flags (from his book-packed study
he hobbies with identifying every ship
that enters the harbor) ; and, of course
(Hartigan having recently written the
history of Sydney’s Darlinghurst parish),
on books and the men who write them.
And on reminiscences. One of the best
in a full life was of the time young Harti-
gan struggled for miles through Snowy
River mountains to administer the last

sacraments to a dying stockrider named
Riley. To entertain the sick man’s
friends —mainly riders —the young priest
recited, appropriately enough, “The Man
from Snowy River.” It was received in
a strange silence. To the reciter’s query,
one stockman jerked his thumb towards
the sickroom door. “The bloke inside is
the man from Snowy River.” Hartigan
claims it was later proved that he was
The pen-name stems from his watching,
in a country town, a milk-vendor named
John O’Brien go past —he was known for
selling adulterated milk. “Adulterated
milk,” I thought; “that’s me. So John
O’Brien it was.” Patrick Joseph Hartigan
was born at Yass 72 years ago—his mind
is as young as ever.
That T.A.A., starting from scratch
five-and-a-half years ago with one DC-3
aircraft, today operates the largest in-
ternal air-route network in the Empire
LESTER BRAIN, of T.A.A.
speaks for good generalship—Lester
Brain, the organisation’s general-manager,
can accept much of the credit. A bank-
clerk in 1922, young Brain was one of
five selected from 700 applicants for entry
into the R.A.A.F., and a few years later
was cleaning up air-derbies in Queensland
and N.S.W. as one of Qantas’s two
original full-time pilots. In the big stir
of 1929, when airmen Anderson and
Hitchcock perished in their attempt to
find the Southern Cross, down in the
wastes of n.-w. Australia, it was Brain
who located the lost aircraft. For that
he was awarded the A.F.C. He hit the
headlines again six weeks later when
Owen and Moir came down on the coast
of Arnhem Land en route from U.K.
Brain quietly sat down and worked out
air-currents, speeds and other factors and
then flew straight to the spot. The pro-
ceeds of a fund an enthusiastic public
opened was handed to the Queensland
Aero Club. In 1934 he flew out from
England the first DHB6 airliner, to open
Qantas’s Brisbane-Singapore run; later,
as wing-commander in the R.A.A.F. Re-
serve, he ferried Catalinas from the U.S.
At 49, having a passion for safety, he
still takes flying refresher courses.
Into the Silence:
In Perth, at 57, Edward Thomas Morgan»
W.A. Department of Agriculture. One of his
greatest contributions to agricultural science
dealt with copper deficiency in soils, which he
was the first to demonstrate in the Statens south;
his corrective measures resulted in an increased
yield of 25 per cent, per acre, putting his
State well to the fore in potato-growing. He
was foundation chairman of the Westralian
Potato Marketing Board.
In Melbourne, at 68, Charles Thomas Cromie,
one-time partner of Melbourne’s Lord Mayor
Nilsen and a director of radio-station 3UZ.
Director, as well, of Neon Electric Signs, and a
leading mason and bowler.
At Campbell Town (Tas.), at 42, Allan Gordon
Hayes, one of Australia’s star machine-shearers.
He had removed more than half a million
fleeces, with 318 as his top tally for eight hours.
In Melbourne, at 88, William Howe, J.P.,
a long-standing stalwart of the Port Melbourne
civic administration. On the council for 42
years, he had been the suburb’s mayor five
times.
In Perth, at 65, George Gordon Campbell,
for many years first-assistant at Scotch College,
and, in his day, one of Westralia’s finest
scholars and athletes. Entering Scotch as a
pupil in 1898, he graduated in Arts from Mel-
bourne University and returned west to teach
at Perth Modern School. With the 11th
Battalion, A.1.F., in War I (part of the time
as an instructor of Australians going through
the O.T.C. at Oxford), he returned a captain,
and joined Scotch College. A tall, square-built
man, he excelled, both as performer and coach,
in rowing, swimming and lacrosse.

Culling Sheep.
Shadow-chaser”; Cull as
soon as the lambs are weaned.
When culling for age the main
criterion is the ewe’s prospective
ability to rear another lamb
under prevailing conditions.
Ewes too old for second-class
country will last another two
years on rich flats. A fat-lamb
breeder’s main concern should
be with teeth and udders. All
spindly-toothed and broken-
mouthed sheep should be re-
jected.
Never use raddle or any indel-
ible marker. For your job a
“dabber” in a clay or mud mix-
ture will suffice. Nothing adds
to the rejected look of a pen of
culls in a saleyard more than
raddle-marks to the full length
of the sheep’s back. A clay
mark on the forehead or the
back of the neck will disappear
in a few days after serving its
purpose.
Reject all ewes with faulty
vessels. Feet must be carefully
examined for traces of foot-rot,
and the legs for permanently
swollen joints due to arthritis.
Two - tooths make com-
plicated culling, as you must
now consider conformation,
type, wool and constitution.
First choose a half-dozen of the
right type and have them in a
pen near where you are work-
ing for comparison with border-
line individuals. Reject all wool-
blind sheep, those with overshot
or undershot jaws, enlarged
joints, or doubtful feet.
It is preferable to cull before
dipping, but if this is incon-
venient delay the job for a
month or so, as dipping alters
the sheep’s appearance for
a while.
Sydney Sheep Show.
“R.N.”: According to N.S.W.
Sheepbreeders’ Association
president, Mac Falkiner, there
are £1,000,000-worth of sheep
on Sydney showground today
for the opening of the 1952
Sheep Show.
Pre-show preparatory costs
this year were the highest oh
record. Breeders estimate a cost
of £4O for each sheep shown.
Fifteen years ago pre-show costs
were estimated at £lO a sheep.
Feed and transport costs have
risen astronomically. Aircraft
will bring many sheep direct
from distant State and inter-
state stations to the ground. The
1200-head of show sheep have
eaten 54001 b. of special feed
each day between them for the
last 12 months. Shearers, who
normally receive about £ls a
hundred for ordinary rams, were
paid special higher rates to shear
the show sheep.
Although wool prices during
the last 10 months averaged
73.82 and. per pound compared
with 151.39 and. per pound in
the corresponding period last
year, breeders expect sale
prices to maintain last year’s
rates. Average price for the
1218 rams and ewes sold at the
1951 sales was 180gns. One ram
sold for 4000gns., a world
auction record.
Tick-control.
“Oxo”: E. W. McCamby,
well-known Central Queensland
cattle-breeder, told a conference
in Rockhampton that use of
modern insecticides to control
cattle-tick was more expensive
than the whole cost of running
a property 10 to 15 years ago.
There were wonderful methods
of tick-control, he said, but all
were too dear.
J. B. Shannon junr., St.
Lawrence, said tick caused some
of their greatest losses. He did
not think the menace was being
tackled from a scientific point
of view with as much vigor as
the losses warranted. At certain
periods the ticks disappeared and
did not come back for 12
months. This might give
scientists something to work on.
Other speakers criticised the
N.S.W. methods, which entail
cattle being dipped every 14
days in a strong arsenical solu-
tion. P. A. Elliot said it was the
acme of stupidity for N.S.W.
authorities to insist on cattle
being dipped in an arsenical solu-
tion, after they had been dipped
in one of the modern insecti-
cides, before they could cross
from Queensland into that State.
He believed they were almost
back to where they were 10
years ago in regard to tick.
Some Queenslanders are
beginning to think the ticks are
developing a tolerance to D.D.T.
mixtures. Whatever the truth of
these matters, it is plain that
tick-prevalence is not being re-
duced, and that present methods
of control aren’t good enough.
Santa Gertrudis.
“C. Punch”: The Santa
Gertrudis cattle, breeding of
which is to begin in Queensland
shortly, are roughly a type fixed
on | Shorthorn and f Brahma
blood. It is the only breed of
cattle ever developed in
America.
There will be two projects in
Australia. One will be a breed-
ing run where S.G. bulls will be
produced. The other will be for
the production of beef-cattle.
Two companies have been
formed, one for each project.
King Ranch Australia, Ltd., was
organised by the King Ranch
of Texas and a group of Aus-
tralian graziers. This firm
bought Risdon, 7500 acres in the
Warwick district, where breed-
ing will be done and auctions
held. New Twin Hills, 250,000
square miles, north of
Clermont, was bought by
Associated Stations, Ltd. In this
are the King Ranch, the same
group of graziers and Swift’s
Australian Company, Ltd. Here
will be demonstrated what the
breed can do as it is used to up-
grade existing herds.
The new breed was developed
after years of work, record-
keeping, and study. The first
cross was made with Brahma
bulls (they were i pure, the best
obtainable at the time) on pure-
bred Shorthorn cows. Sub-
sequently the Brahma bulls were
replaced with bulls of a better
and more uniform type.
The best red heifers were
selected from this first cross and
mated with the best red bulls
carrying a similar percentage of
Brahma blood, but unrelated.
Through selection, the breeders
sought to develop a stud in
which the bull-calves would be
red in color and superior to the
first cross of the Brahma bull on
the Shorthorn cow. It took two
or three years for the best in-
dividual to be found among the
first-cross bulls, and until this
bull was found, progress was
comparatively slow.
This animal was Monkey,
and not only was it found that
he was the best bull ever seen on
the King Ranch, but his off-
spring also, both male and
female, have proved themselves
to be superior range and beef-
animals and prepotent in most
circumstances. Close inbreed-
ing was practised so that the
whole herd is now descended
from Monkey.
The S.G. is the first breed of
cattle that does not run a sun
temperature. Its ideal adapt-
ability to hot climate is shown
by the fact that calves at wean-
ing-time average about 1001 b,
more than British breeds. Under
normal conditions on the King
Ranch (not the extreme drought
of the past three years), S.G.
calves at eight months of age
will average 5001 b., and four-
year-old steers, finished on grass
for market, average about
14001 b. It is claimed that S.G.
have great resistance to heat and
to insect-pests, hardiness, pro-
pensity to fatten and early
maturity.
Hybrid Maize Again.
“R.A.S.”: Three acres of
Sundrise hybrid-maize, saved by
irrigation during the recent
drought in the Mudgee (N.S.W.)
district, is expected to yield 131
bushels an acre. Many un-
irrigated maize-crops in the same
district died during the drought.
The high-yielding Sundrise
stand is on R. Menchin’s mixed-
farming property at Willowtree
Flat. The crop won first place
in the Mudgee maize-competition.
The yield from Menchin’s
crop is expected to exceed by
100 bushels an acre the State
maize-yield average of 30
bushels an acre. H. N. Sarina,
R.A.S. Registrar, says Menchin
selected for a second maize-
sowing land which previously
had been used for a long period
as a pasture, ploughed it early
in July, worked the land three
times, reploughed it in August,
cultivated and harrowed the area
twice more and planted the
hybrid-seed in October, in rows
only 3ft. apart.
Making a Rose Garden.
“Big Billy”: If space is not a
major consideration, choose an
unshaded location away from
tall trees. Give protection from
prevailing winds by a wall or
hedge. Good drainage is a
“must.” If soil is inclined to be
gravelly, clayey or chalky only,
it will need careful preparation.

“This oughter git results , Martha.”
Teas, chinas, rugosas and many
wichuraianas do best on a light
gritty soil, while the hybrid-teas,
hybrid-perpetuals and briers
thrive on a heavy, retentive soil.
A bed sft. wide will allow two
rows of bushes each a foot from
the edge of the bed and
separated from each other by a
3ft. space. Three rows may be
planted in a bed 6ft. wide if the
bushes in the centre row are
placed diagonally between those
of the outer rows.
When preparing the soil dig it
deeply and use compost freely.
Then dress the surface with
slaked-lime at the rate of 4oz.
per square yard. Heavy soils
can be made more friable by
digging in materials such as
wood-ashes, sand or by liming.
Before selecting the plants
visit a botanic gardens or
nursery where roses are doing
well and make a choice from the
species which are thriving, A
good bush should have four
strong roots, a mass of fibrous
roots and four strong stems.
Plants benefit from being sunk
in a bucket of water for an hour
before planting. Shorten over-
long roots, remove damaged
roots and any leaves or seed-
pods and cover the roots to pre-
vent drying. Remove only one
plant at a time from the cover.
The hole must be large enough
to take the outspread roots and
deep enough to allow the point
of bud union to be about an
inch below the surface of the
soil. After distributing the
roots, lightly sprinkle with soil
plus a handful of bone-dust or
bonemeal, cover with a further
three inches of soil and tread
down firmly.
For standard roses drive a
stake into the ground before the
plant is put in, and don’t tie
firmly until the plant has settled
down. Standards need planting
a little deeper than bush-roses.
Climbers should be planted 6in.
from the supporting structure,
each in a site about 18in.
square.
New Fodder Process.
“Sigh Low”: There is no
doubt of the efficacy of the pro-
cess described (B. 14/5/’52) as
a South African discovery for
converting waste material into
palatable silage. It has already
been demonstrated that such
material can be converted into
either compost or silage by
treatment.
Silage is much more difficult
to make than compost, as it re-
quires a rather exactly controlled
fermentation. When making
silage from green material it is
not hard to effect such control,
as the material contains its own
essential bacteria and fermenta-
tion enzymes, together with their
food-supply in the form of
sugar, etc. It also provides its
own heat, which is prevented by
pressure and the exclusion of
air from becoming too great.
With dead stuff, however,
water, organisms in pure culture
to secure the right kind of
enzyme fermentation, and their
food-supply (molasses) must be
added. Though palatable silage
can thus be made, its feeding-
value will be poor in com-
parison with that made from
green cereals or maize. Most
of the nutriment from straw
and stalks has already gone into
the grain.
For other reasons, the S.A.
process is unlikely to interest
Australian farmers. The labor
requirements and trouble
associated with it put it out of
consideration except where
abundant cheap labor is avail-
able, as in India and Africa, and
where there is a chronic dearth
of feed for several months each
year.
Silage material of such low
feeding-value would only be
suitable for large, rough stock as
a less-than-bare maintenance
feed.
Further, not many coastal
dairyfarmers in Australia make
silage nowadays. Those who do
realise that it should be of the
highest possible quality for milk-
production. The majority, how-
ever, prefer to depend on sown
THE WEATHER.
By Inigo Jones.
A new southern sunspot group entered the southern
track about May 18 and should produce the cyclical minor
rains of the latter part of May. Entering as it did while the
last southern group was still capable of reaction it produced
a further disturbance and gave some very good rains.
Following the minor rain there should be a cold spell
and then showers prior to the important main rain of mid-
June.
The present sunspot period is taking a rather unusual
course, which agrees with my theories. The recent
opposition of the magnetic fields of Jupiter and Uranus
proves the connection between the sunspot curve and the
planetary positions, and its effect on weather. Overseas
findings confirm this.

A Poultry-shed.
“Inver”; Make it neat in
design, well built and large
enough to provide ample room
for the birds. Be sure it fits in
with local Government regula-
tions. Its appearance can be
improved by strips of lawn or
concrete along front and sides.

modate 12 hens.
Feeding Calves.
“Myrrhee”: Linseed-meal is
an effective substitute for butter-
fat, which few calves get after
the first few days. Give the meal
in a mixture of crushed oats
and pollard in the proportions
of crushed oats 41b., linseed-
meal 31b. and pollard 21b.
Mix these well and add 4ygal.
of water; bring slowly to the
boil, stirring occasionally, and
simmer for 20 minutes. When
cool, the mixture forms into a
jelly-like mass which is fed in
separated milk at the rate of
a pint to lj pints a day. Make
sufficient to last two or three
days, no longer, particularly in
hot weather. Slightly larger
quantities are given in water if
skim-milk or whey isn’t avail-
able.
Hints for the Farm.
“Springvale”: May and June
are the best months to apply
organic manure to asparagus-
beds. Stable-manure or compost
spread in layers and lightly
forked is ideal. Poultry-manure,
plus super, at the rate of 21b. to
the bag of manure, is also a
good dressing, using a bag to 10
square yards. In acid soils, a
dressing of lime is beneficial a
week or two before the final
dressing.
“Billjim”: Green slime can be
prevented from forming in
troughs by placing a short
length of copper wire in the
water.
“M.”: Mix powdered blue-
stone with four times its weight
of fine sand (251 b. of bluestone
to 1001 b. of sand is sufficient for
one acre), and sprinkle the
mixture around swampy areas,
dams and other watering-places
to kill fluke snail. If you don’t
fluke will kill your sheep.
“Sparker”: When making
simple electrical repairs without
the correct tools the job of
stripping the insulation from
wires isn’t easy—unless you slip
the wire between the claws of
an ordinary hammer and pull.
That’ll strip the rubber and
cotton away.
“Rann”: The only way to
beat onion-weed in the home-
garden is by constant cultivation
and lifting out every bulb that
can be seen. The bulb will not
stand constant cutting. Every
time a stalk appears cut it off.
Don’t expect success under 12
months at the earliest.

TO YOUNG MEN
As always , Australia looks with great
pride upon her Servicemen
As in the critical war years, our sailors, soldiers
and airmen to-day have the respect and admira-
tion of every loyal citizen. And never before
have Servicemen enjoyed such fine career oppor-
tunities. To-day the modernised Navy, Army
and Air Force have become important career
grounds, packed with opportunities for keen
young men seeking to share in a vital national
task and at the same time satisfy personal
ambitions. There are now more than 100
different specialist occupations throughout the
Services. There are special facilities for techni-
cal training. There are ever-increasing openings
for improvement due to rapid expansion. There
are special privileges, pension and gratuity plans,
all of which make Service life the outstanding
career of the day. Get the full story without
delay.
AN IMPORTANT FACT ABOUT SERVICE PAY
There is one basic fact that makes a substantial
increase in a Serviceman’s income. The value of
the “extras” over and above cash pay. As an
example, an 18-year-old Serviceman who has
completed his basic recruit training (usually 3 to
6 months') earns over £9\ls\- a week and in
addition is provided free of cost with food,
clothing, accommodation and medical and dental
attention. Married men receive special extra
allowances.

Diplomat.
“The British Foreign Office, in
announcing that Burgess and Maclean,
the two diplomats who disappeared
behind the Iron Curtain, have now
been sacked, has explained that this
action was taken as a ‘routine discip-
linary measure,’ as they had now been
absent without leave for nearly a
year.”
This almost rashly impulsive
action demonstrates clearly how
the Foreign Office has speeded
up since the old days when my
Uncle Eustace was in the service.
Eustace joined as a cadet, and
“But Mummy wants to go THIS way."
a brilliant future was predicted
for him at the Diplomatic
Academy when he gained top
place in the practical subjects,
taking first-class honors in
flicking a glass of drugged wine
into an aspidistra while pretend-
ing to drink it, delivering an in-
sult in such a manner that the
insultee is under the impression
he is being complimented, telling
lies so that the tongue is not
visible in the cheek from close
quarters, and in bowing from
the waist.
So meteoric was his rise in the
service that by the time he was
34 he had got his appointment
as second secretary to the First
Secretary to the Consul at
Manana, capital of the banana
republic of San Molo.
It was in this capacity that
one day he opened a communi-
cation from Foreign Minister of
San Molo, Senor Castanet. In
it the Minister complained that
Senor Euslace Boobe (his spell-
ing of my uncle’s Christian-name
might have been inaccurate, but
at least it had penetration) had
insulted him at the reception to
the new Panaravian Ambassador
by swallowing his sherry in one
gulp before he, Senor Castanet,
could take a sip from his. He
considered it demanded a written
apology as well as 10,000 pesetos
compensation for loss of dignity
and prestige he had suffered.
By this time Uncle Eustace
was getting fed up with eternal
bowings and sherry-drinkings;
also, he had a natural talent for
vinegary invective, and its forced
suppression at times got him very
depressed. So in a rebellious
burst he turned up the corner of
the communication and wrote
“Rattled, eh, Castanet? Well,
you can go to hell!” signed it,
sent it back to the Foreign Office
of San Molo and, anticipating
the bullet, packed up and went
off on a chamois-shooting ex-
pedition—he was getting short
of cleaning materials for his old
one-lung Di Dion —without even
telling the Consul.
Nearly two years later he re-
turned and, being reminded of
a borrowed book, and remem-
bering he had left it on his desk,
he went back to the Consulate
to get it.
When he went in the First
Secretary turned on him a look
which might have held in it
something of mild remonstrance
had it not been so diplomatically
dissembled, seemed about to
raise his eyebrows but thought
better of it, and said mildly “Oh,
Mr. Boobe, re that business of
the concessions for fly-swats,
corset-bones and crystal-balls
sought by the Gafflesmerk Gew-
gaw Company—the Foreign
Minister of San Molo is asking
for an answer to the letter he
wrote last September-12-months,
You have been away on that
mission into the interior or what-
ever it was rather longer than
we expected. Would you give it
your attention? Oh, and I forgot
to mention the F.O. has
approved of your appointment
as from last February as first
secretary to the Second Secre-
tary —you will be in charge of
inviting and arranging guests to
functions in the strict order of
their importance —it means a
salary-increase of £l5 annually.”
As Uncle Eustace hadn’t been
able to get financial backing for
a concession for ice-skates for
which he was angling, he was,
temporarily at least, glad to re-
sume his diplomatic duties. In
another few years he had risen
to the eminence of first secretaiy
to the First Secretary, his duties
being almost entirely social. So
smooth had he become in this
sphere, in fact, that even after
having soaked up 27 sherries at a
ball he could lead a cotillon,
carry on a learned discussion on
Babylonian blank verse, of
which he knew nothing, or hold
forth on the hybridisation of
new strains of self-bending
bananas.
But the long-continued ex-
posure to constant bowings,
polite lying and sherry-drinking
was brewing in him another re-
bellion. One night at a reception
he injudiciously took a 28th
sherry, and all the repressions
he had been bottling up for years
exploded. Going up to the
President of the Republic or San
Molo, he slapped him on the
back so heartily the Presidents
top'-set flew across the floor.
Then, jerking a thumb over his
shoulder at a stout woman, he
said loudly “What are you feed-
ing your missus on these days,
Ricardo? She’s getting like the
side of a house!” Then he stag-
gered home to pack.
It was about seven years later
that Uncle Eustace —long settled
in Australia, where he was in-
dulging a natural genius for in-
vention by trying to evolve a
process for de-smoking smoked-
fish —received a letter from
London. It was from the F. 0.,
advising him that should he per-
sist in overstaying unauthorised
the final irrevocable step
might have to be deeply con-
sidered of dispensing with his
services.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Luxury Hotels
The Queensland Government’s refusal
to subsidise the Royal Hayrnan Hotel on
the Barrier Reef is not surprising. With
few exceptions, the very expensive pub-
bery at a holiday resort anywhere in the
world shows either a small profit or is in
the white-elephant class. Conversely, the
well-managed venture which sets out
to cater for people on lower incomes
is usually a financial success.
An outstanding example of this is the
Butlin holiday camp in Britain. As a
lad its originator ran a hoop-la show. All
his rivals worked on the principle “Never
give a mug a break,” and regarded £3
per day as good takings. Butlin went for
a bigger turnover by giving the player a
better chance to win. As a result, the
crowd thronged his stand and won a lot
of prizes. At the end of the first day he
found he had taken £lB and paid out £l2.
Butlin applied that principle to cater-
ing for holiday-makers. He was not
interested in wealthy patrons; he wanted
to give Mr. and Mrs. Ramsbottom and
Young Albert good value for their
money. He did, and made a fortune for
himself.
In the Barrier Reef we have a tourist
attraction which rivals anything offered
by California, Florida, Honolulu or the
West Indies. What we need on the islands
along the reef —and also in equally
charming winter-sunshine resorts in
places such as the tip of Cape
York and along the coast of W.A. from
Carnarvon northward —are rows of com-
fortable but not luxurious shacks, to
cater for the people with a limited
amount of money to spend. The adver-
tised charge should be inclusive in fact
as well as name. Staff— and its attendant
troubles for the manager —should be kept
to the minimum by the system which
works so well in America.
There, free holidays are offered to
people willing to work. It is done on a
roster system; each person spends one
day in dish-washing, sweeping, bed-
making, in the laundry, or as cook’s off-
sider, and one day as a guest. It can be
done on alternate days, or one week on
and one week off. When all meals are
provided on the cafeteria self-service
system and the guests are given to under-
stand beforehand that there isn’t a host
of lackeys to wait on them —and to be
tipped—the reasonably-priced holiday be-
comes a fact.
Much attention is given to the possi-
bility of attracting wealthy Americans
here for holidays as a source of dollars.
I’ve studied the species at close range, and
agree with the hotelkeepers that tourists
of this type, with their exacting demands
in the way of service, are not worth
bothering about. Americans of another
class, however, are well worth attracting.
They haven’t much money to throw
around —but they will spend what they
have just as they do in their own country,
without asking for luxury accommodation.
All they require is a chance to see some-
thing different, plus sport in the way of
fishing, shooting, etc. We can offer it.
Some day an enterprising man will
offer the person of average income the
holiday of a lifetime, at a reasonable
cost. He will also make quite a bit
of money for himself. —H. A. Lindsay
(S.A.). __
Loans
Some of the reasons why I shall not be
contributing to the State Premiers’ astro-
nomical loan demands;
In the past I let the Government have
the use of my spare cash in the belief that
the capital was not merely secure, but
available when I might need it. The
Government paid me £3 2s. 6d. a year for
each £lOO I lent. Today, if I want my
money, I must sell my £lOO for some-
where about £9o—which means that
about three years’ interest (on which I
paid income tax) has gone down the
drain.
I don’t trust the State Governments to
use my money to the best advantage.
Among other things, I don’t propose to
help finance a lot of boards which pro-
vide soft cops for ex-politicians.
I’ll be sorry if shortage of loan-money
creates unemployment, but I feel that, if
Government jobs were a little harder to
come by, they would be more highly
valued by those lucky enough to land
them. These might then work a little
harder and, if the example proved catch-
ing everyone might work harder, and very
soon increased production would be
helping to solve our national money-
“ He's a lefthanded genius.”
troubles. A brief period of unemploy-
ment might well be the dose of physic we
need.
Experts tell me that the cure for in-
flation is to increase the quantity of goods
and/or reduce the amount of cash avail-
able. Convince me that loan-moneys will
be exclusively and economically spent on
expanding such services as power and
transport to increase production, and I
might invest in them. Otherwise I can
only see them as inflationary increases to
the amount of cash in circulation. — Hist
(N.S.W.).
Inflation
A, H. Traversi’s cure for our present
troubles is merely to revert to the gold
standard and stick to it. Even if that
were possible, the cure is not quite so
simple.
The gold standard as a control on
paper currencies has failed to survive in
this wild 20th century, and the authorities
who issue the note currency have no
control of the complicated forces which
are causing our present inflationary plight.
They cannot induce people to work
harder, or the profiteer to charge a fair
price, so they must increase the note
issue as and when it becomes necessary
to do so.
The debasement of our currency is
the inevitable consequence of the weak-
ness of the human animal under condi-
tions which could be real prosperity.
If the note-issue was not increased
there would be payless paydays and banks
unable to pay withdrawals, and allthe
panic that would ensue.
The gravitation of gold to the U.S.A.
has not been due to any deliberate
debasement of currency by other coun-
tries, but to their need of goods from
the U.S.A. —which needs few imports.
The U.S.A., with nearly all the world’s
gold in its coffers, and notwithstanding
Gresham’s law, is also a bad sufferer
from currency debasement, inflation or
what-have-you.
I can suggest nothing other than what
is stressed by “H.H.S.” (B. 16/4/’52), that
we need a Government determined on
any steps, however distressful, which are
essential to the economic survival of the
nation, and we also need electors with
sufficient intelligence to keep that Govern-
ment in office.—L. J. H. (Vic.).
Liquor Reform
If “Mullum” (B. 23/4/’52) had lived
for 24 years in the old, unregenerate slum
of Sandridge (now Port Melbourne) and
remembered the old days when every-
thing was wide open, he might have
modified his enthusiasm for long hotel
hours.
The pubs were wide open before
breakfast, and I do not know when they
closed —after midnight. The “boys”—
seamen, “lumpers,” biscuit-makers, glass-
blowers, sugar-baggers, soap-makers—
used to drink everything in sight, and,
though there was no unemployment, there
was stark poverty, and the wretched
wives had to make out on the few and
grudged shillings from the stalwarts who
drew the wages.
I don’t know what other causes have
been at work, but certainly a reduced rate
of excessive drinking has come with re-
duction of hotel hours. Possibly the
missionary work of the despised
“wowsers”, has had something to do
with it.
That is not to claim that “wowsers”
have had the final say in re-
ducing statutory hours. Their influence
has helped, but the main cause has been
the awards —not even a publican likes
having to pay overtime rates.
The long-established custom is to re-
gard the drunk, awheel, afoot or in the
gutter, as the complete and perfect clown.
If, instead, we treated him as the filthy
and disgusting object he really is, we
might, in a generation or two, breed some
kind of conscience in the matter. —
H. E. R. (Q.).
“Mullum” (8.. 23/4/’52) does not recog-
nise that the people so fanatically
opposed to grog are mostly those who
see the social consequences of alcohol in
all their terrifying bleakness. The good-
fellowship of the bar is a notable and
meaningful part of the ordinary com-
merce of human affairs, but it is the social
worker, the clergyman and the people of
their class who see all the evil.
That the evil arises from the mis-
use and abuse of grog is clear enough,
and the wreckage of homes, lives and
careers and the utterly hopeless miser)
are too self-evident to be passed over
unawares by any sensible person.
“Wowser” is a product of brewery
propaganda, not a true figure of real life
except in rare and pathological instances.
The late Canon Hammond, for instance,
had too large a humanity for any but a
hopeless pub-hunter to call him a
wowser.
Some degree of social control over grog
is necessary, and the best to be hoped
for is that the average citizen’s freedom
of choice and decision about alcohol
will be maintained, while the strongest
possible safeguards will be placed
around its abuse.
Nobody is blameless. The man who
resents the interference of the militant tee-
totaller fails to see the social problems
lurking in the background, simply be-
cause, to him, there is no personal social
problem. The militant teetotaller fails to
realise that there seems to be some pro-
found neurosis hidden deep in the whole
human make-up which has led almost
every civilisation to find this curious form
of self-expression or self-escape.
A lot of nonsense is talked about it.
The plain fact is that grog to the average
man is a relaxation which brings no
serious harm to himself, his dependants,
or his social/economic obligations. And
laws will always tend to be made for the
average man.— Dee (N.S.W.).
Municipal Rates
Excessive though rates are, property-
owners would not object so bitterly to the
increased municipal assessments for 1952
if councils made even a pretence of giv-
ing some return for the money.
Garbage and sanitary collection-levies
are exorbitant enough, but at least they
provide for necessary services. Despite
the rapacious rates, however, there
are the generally potholed condition of
most streets and footpaths, filthy and
often blocked gutters and open drains
and the unkempt state of reserves.
Paspalum, noxious weeds, thistles, etc.,
run riot, and, if individual householders
didn’t display a lot more pride than their
Civic Fathers, most footpaths would soon
become overgrown.
Councillors chant the dirge of the 40-
hour week and high wages, but the sums
collected by them in recent years should
have been enough to make garden-
suburbs of sandhills or the wildest bush.
Anyway, it’s high time municipal
bodies were obliged to furnish ratepayers
with more exact accounts of annual
revenue and expenditure. Also overdue,
all adult persons in a municipality
should, after a reasonable time,
share the burden now borne entirely by
property-owners or would-be property-
owners. Surely it isn’t unreasonable to
expect all persons sharing the amenities
of established communities to share the
responsibility of footing the bill. —

You could take your change in dingo scalps
in the good old days before Nation
“Howell yer ’ave yer change, mate? Dingo scalps or ‘shinplasters’?” We can’t vouch for the
exact conversation, but that was what you were liable to be asked by a country storekeeper, in
die good' old days, before we got all tangled up with banks and pound notes.
in the outback of those times there wasn’t a
bank in every town, so storekeepers gave you
change in promissory notes. These were
known as “shinplasters”—why, we don’t know,
but we gather that they must have been made
of some pretty stout material, to stand the
knocking round they’d get before being re-
claimed. Dingo scalps, worth 7/6 at a Police
Station, were also passed around. They’d
travel from town to town, and finally wind up
at a place with a Police Station where they
could be cashed.
This free and easy currency system depended
for its success on the honesty of the men con-
cerned. Inevitably it broke down when one
storekeeper, smarter than the rest, started
baking “shinplasters” in an oven before he
handed them out.
They would last for one or two days, then
disintegrate into thousands of dust-like frag-
ments. He got away with it for a while, but
was caught eventually, and “shinplasters”
. . .discredited. , .gradually disappeared,
1 oday, with the high cost of labour it would
be very convenient if you could pay off a
shearing team in rabbit-skins, for instance.
Unfortunately it has to be in real cash.
HIGH WAGES AND WORN OUT EQUIP-
MENT COST GRAZIERS BIG MONEY
Wages have skyrocketed, and although there
has been a recent slight reduction in shearers’
rates you can’t afford to lose any time during
shearing, or you’ll be up for quite a substantial
loss. .
Take the case of a Queensland grazier whose
shearing gear let him down, right on shearing
time. The contractors arrived with a team to
shear 7000 sheep. With the grazier’s seven
stand plant they reckoned on cutting out in
less than three weeks.
During the first couple of days it took two
experts, working flat out all the time, to keep
five of the seven stands going at once. At times
the whole plant had to be stopped for major
repairs. The shearing would have taken them
nearer five weeks than three.
As soon as the grazier realised the position he
had the conversion unit rushed from the city,
but it cost him a day’s waiting time for shearers
and pressers, and an extra day’s pay for shed-
hands and cook, as well as food and lodging
for the whole team. . .roughly about £50.
On top of that he had to pay extra for rush
delivery and installation, so he was probably
down a good £80 or £90 above the cost of
new gear.
The gear was in such a bad way that it must
have cost the grazier £30 or more a year, for
the previous five or six shearings, to keep it
running. He could have paid for a completely
new plant, and saved trouble and money, on
the amount his old plant finally cost him.
In this, as in many other cases, the grazier was
not really at fault. He had been told by
previous experts, evidently wanting to curry
favour, that his gear would last a few more
years. But it eventually decided to give up the
ghost altogether, and he was trapped... a
victim of his own false economy.
CONTRACTORS WANT GOOD
EQUIPMENT
Shearing contractors often have teams of
shearers who refuse to go to a shed because
of bad gear. A few months ago a committee
of Graziers in the Bourke district tried to get
a fixed price for contract shearing.
Commenting on this, Mr. L. G, Mclnnes, of
the Shearing Contractors Association, said ‘‘If
the present committee is to meet with any

solid foundation for resistance by ensuring that
they not only comply with the law regarding
housing and amenities for shearing employees,
but that they supply the BEST POSSIBLE
EQUIPMENT for the job.”
YOUR GEAR MIGHT SHEAR BUT.. .
Apart from actual breakdowns and hold-ups
you get all these troubles with old gear, , .
<1 Noise and vibration from worn bearings and down-
tubes,
• Transmission losses from worn, greasy cone pulleys
and worn bearings.
• Added wear and tear on handpieces from sloppy
drive.
• Varying speeds from stand to stand caused by dif-
ferent diameters of trimmed-down cone-pulleys.
• Increased engine running and maintenance costs,
because wdrn-out plain bearing transmission places
a much greater load on it.
If you want a smooth, trouble-free shearing
with a team of contented shearers on the job,
you must give them good equipment. You’re
not only helping them. . . you re being a truly
sound business man too. . . just as you are
when you trade-in your old car on a newer,
more efficient model.
You will actually make more money by keep-
ing every piece of mechanical equipment right
up to the peak of operating efficiency.
NEW PAY RATES
FOR SHEARERS
Rates of pay for shearing employees have
dropped. This is in accordance with the
agreement on wool value allowance for the
1932 season.
The rates did not drop in direct proportion
to the value of wool. They were partly offset
by the Basic Wage rise of 15/- in November.
These rates will operate from May 19th, but
they are only tentative, as the Commissioner
has not heard all claims. Final rates should be
fixed by the end of June, and some alteration
could occur.
Main changes in rates are;—
Old Rate. New Rate.
Shearers, per 100 .. £7 19 6 £6 7 6
Shed Hands “Found*''.. 15 5 0 13 18 10

This is not a substantial drop in rates. It means
that graziers, who are fighting a very real
battle against synthetic fibres, will have to turn
to modem farming methods and modern
equipment to cut their production costs.
Graziers must produce better wool, more
cheaply, and the only ways of doing it are to
carry more sheep, with the help of pasture im-
provement, and install more and better
mechanical aids.
GOOD SHEARING GEAR MEANS
LOWER PRODUCTION COSTS
If you have good, up-to-date shearing gear
you cut out a large slice of your maintenance
bills,
Moffat-Virtue Gear, with its Full-floating
Transmission, can help you to lower those bills,
and increase your yield as well.
• Full-floating Transmission eliminates any drag on
the cone pulley from the downtube. No matter
how hard the shearer pulls on the handpiece the
speed of the cutter does not vary.
• Sheep are not bruised by the plucking action of
the cutter. . .wool growth is unhampered by
damaged wool follicles. . . and second cuts are
greatly reduced. x
• Comb, cutter and handpiece breakages are reduced
too, by the Shock-absorber Spring. In burrs or
other slight obstructions this spring causes a frac-
tional hesitation, which clears the trouble without
disengaging the handpiece.
• When the handpiece locks completely the spring
automatically disengages the handpiece from the
downtube.
The Full-floating Transmission and the Shock
Absorber Spring are standard equipment on
all Moffat-Virtue shed-type Gear.
They are exclusive to M.V. Gear, and full
details can be obtained from any of the Dis-
tributors listed at the bottom of this page.
