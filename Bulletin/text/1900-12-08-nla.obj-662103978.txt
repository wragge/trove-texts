FOR AUSTRALIA.
THE object of life, for everything
living, is the satisfaction of natural
appetites. Even in the simplest
organisms there must exist some quality
of satisfaction ia the fulfilment of func-
tion to differentiate them (for example)
from the unorganised rock-crystal or the
insentient machine. The self-conscious-
ness of the ephemerae may be so vague
and slight as to be incognisable even by
themselves; yet their day's flight is the
satisfaction of an instinct, and in that
satisfaction they have their share, how-
ever minute, of the principle of Jife.
As organisation becomes more complex,
the share increases. To the bird
which trills to its mate in the sun-
shine must be conceded some con-
sciousness of an achieved object of exist-
ence—some sense of the nature and
value of the reaction of its organism to
the power of living which the universe
supplies. And the human animal differs
from others only in the greater com-
plexity of its organisation, which gives it
more desires to satisfy, and inore capaci-
ties of satisfaction. The crowds which will
witness the celebration of the establish-
ment of the Commonwealth in Australia
seek, in their way and degree, precisely
the same object as the bullocks which are
slaughtered for their sustenance or the
horses which are tamed to draw their
vehicles—they seek to live as fully and
continuously as they are able. And from
pageanjt or music or oration each man in
the,-crowd will receive precisely as much
stimulus as his physical constitution per-
mits—the word physical being used in its
wider sense to include the psychical which
flowers from it. He will get the satis-
faction of such appetites as he possesses,
in the measure that his vital energy
allows, to the extent which the celebra-
tion supplies.
* * * m
This is obvious enough; but the
is often forgotten. In the sway which
the habit of words, the habit of facts,
exercise over the mind, we are apt to lose
sight of the physical basis of life by
attending too exclusively to modes of
living. Yet the utter dependence of
nearly all human beings on the satisfac-
tion of sensual appetites for their realisa-
tion of life shows how closely still even the
best of us are allied with the brutaL So to
the crowds which will witness the celebra-
tion of the Commonwealth we supply, as
means of rejoicing, flags, and bands
of music, and triumphal arches, and the
spectacle of soldiers marching, and the
empty verbiage of temporary politicians.
Those are the methods by which the
appetites of crowds are satisfied—
barbarous enough, since usually neither
the blare nor the glare is harmonious,
and the speeches, in a country where
oratory is unknown, are usually inept
and futile ; —and not barbarous enough,
since, in many of the times we call bar-
barous, pageantry was a science and
speech-making an art. And the man in
the crowd will stare till his eyes are
itigued, and listen till his ears are
tigued, and run hither and thither till
s legs are- fatigued; and when his
bck of nervous energy is exhausted,
I will return to his crude home
Ih the knowledge that he has not lost
Jay, since his senses of seeing and
hearing and his capacity for locomotion
have been satiated to the .utmost. And,
with the best wit in the world, we can
devise no other method of public rejoic-
ing which will satisfy the crowd so well.
The crowd’s ideal of the pleasure of life
is still essentially the child’s idea, the
savage’s idea, 'of Blare and Glare—a
series of sensations as violent as possible,
culminating in nervous and
auto-intdxication.
* * * *
The celebration by Blare and Glare of
the establishment of the Commonwealth
is the process by which we ma'ke intelli-
gible to the crowd the supposed signifi-
cance of the Commonwealth : it is a kind
of picture-writing by which we give objec-
tive shape to the idea of the Nation. If
a sufficient number of violent sensations
are associated with that idea, the crowd
cannot but be impressed with the im-
portance of the Nation. For the rest, it
will translate the idea into its own men-
tal language by the aid of instinct. In
the process of evolution, the character or
the necessities of the human animal have
at different times made desirable or in-
evitable the acquisition of various in-
stincts secondary to the main instincts of
Self-Preservation and Self-Reproduction.
These instincts have been inherited and
transferred in greater or less intensity
from race to race, from generation to
generation. Chief among them are the
instinct of the Family, the instinct of
the Tribe or Community, the instinct of
Religion or Ghost-Worship, the instinct
of the Race or Country. And looming
beyond these we can see the instinct of
Humanity and the Universe arriving in
a natural progress—based on the idea
of expansion of the Ego in the
All. But neither the instinct of
Humanity nor any other secondary in-
stinct is intellectually defensible unless
conceived in terms of the individual’s
primary instinct of Self-Preservation,
unless conceived as Self-Preservation
raised to a higher plane. Self-Preserva-
tion is the only instinct which absolutely
justifies itself, since to preserve one’s-
self is to live, and to live is at all events
to fulfil a function, to receive sensations,
to satisfy the original appetite for living.
All the other instincts involve a gift of
life. The individual gives to his mate,
to his children, to his community, to his
country, to humanity. And the gift is
only intellectually defensible when it is a
valid exchange, when the individual
receives in the sensations which his
organism demands an equivalent of the
energy which he expends upon others. It
is not more’ blessed to give than to
receive. But it is blessed to give when
the gift brings an equivalent receipt of
the sensations which comprise the quality
of life of which the individual is capable
: —and if possible a little more than an
equivalent. And that is the sole reason-
able basis of ethics for any individual.
**, * •
We are no longer content with the
primary instinct of Self-Preservation.
Other instincts have developed so greatly
that many human beings are willing
and eager to sacrifice their lives to
the life of others ; —-but only be-
cause such dying is the best way of
living they can find at a given point of
life. The man who fights for a shibboleth
and is killed satisfies his appetite equally
with him who runs away for the satisfac-
tion of his appetite of mere living.. The
problem of life for any individual is, How
can I satisfy most appetites 1 how receive
most and best sensations ?—and he solves
it according to his nature and capacity.
The man in the crowd is a crea-
ture of habit: he accepts without con-
sideration the instincts which heredity
and environment have implanted *in him.
But it would be profitable to him and to
others to pass their instincts and habits
in array, and ask of each/ How does this
increase my life 1 What does it give me ?
How does it pay me?
* * * *
The instinct of Patriotism, of Love of
Race and Country, is that which the
establishment of the Commonwealth calls
to stand at the bar of judgment. How
will the Commonwealth benefit the man
in the crowd who welcomes and acclaims 1
What fuller life will it give him 1 What
appetites of living will it satisfy ? And,
on a reasonable survey, it may be found
that, except for a slightly increased
chance of self-preservation, a slightly in-
creased chance of profitable living, it
gives him nothing—except what he can
makfe out of it. He is still dependent for
his life on himself: the Common-
wealth is worth just so much as
he can make it worth, and no
more. There is no salvation in the
abstract idea of Australian union: its
chief value is as a stimulus to effort, and
the effort must always be the concrete
effort of the men who compose the union.
There is no profit in having a nation to
die for, unless the individual’s instinct to
die for a nation is so strong that dying is
his best living. There is no profit in
having a nation to live for, unless the
nation will give in satisfaction of the
individual’s appetites an equivalent of the
energy which he devotes to living for it.
The Commonwealth, as an abstract idea?
may give the satisfaction of the instinct
of devotion to country ; it can supply a
target for a hitherto unsatisfied instinct;
but beyond that, as an abstract idea,
it gives nothing. The practical value of
the Commonwealth to any individual, as
a means of better living, will depend up-
on himself and the other individuals who
compose the Commonwealth. And, after
the celebration and the shouting, the
worth of these constituents will be much
as before. There is no magical quality
in this union : no millennium is to be
reached by the declaration of a Federal
Act in so many chapters , and so many
clauses. We suppose that the Common-
wealth will give us greater scope for
effort, a wider field for energy; but it is
always our effort, our energy.
• • • *
The Commonwealth must justify itself.
For those who have a patriotic instinct,
whose profit to themselves comes merely
in satisfaction of the appetite for patriot-
ism, it may be justified already. But for
those whose patriotism does not go so
far as instinct, who ask that patriotism
stand and deliver its reasons why energy
should be expended in its service,
who ask that it supply an equiva-
lent in life for the life which it
exacts, the Comrdonwealth must supply
reasons. Australian union should be
made to pay every Australian individual
—not in money, but in fuller life. The
standard of living in Australia is so low
at present—not in comparison with the
standard of living in other countries, but
in comparison with an attainable ideal,
in comparison with the actual attainment
of some Australian classes—that it is
easily possible for good government to
elevate it for all. But good govern-
ment does not consist merely in
the passage of Parliamentary Acts,
devised mainly to meet a temporary
emergency, and needing continual amend-
ment. It does not consist in the adapta-
tion Of policies to current needs, or in the
adaptation of means of commerce or
finance to the temporary requirements of
the community. These things are neces-
sary and have their value; but they
are not the things which are most
necessary and of the greatest value.
Not to politics, but to statesmanship we
must look for the creation of a Common-
wealth which will fully justify itself to
the individuals who compose it; and
statesmanship in Australia is hardly to
be seen. Yet its main principles, as
applied to this country, are so simple and
familiar that they have been vulgarised
into almost-discredited catch-words.
» * * *
The first is the development of natural
resources, involving the settlement of the
community on the land as self-supporting
producers of the means of living. Cant
phrases these, in the mouth of every
hustings ranter ; yet so little valued in
the strife of petty factions and the
advancement of self - seeking poli-
ticians that after more than a hun-
dred years of government one-third,
of the whole Australian population
is concentrated in the capital cities.
Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, in
particular, are like huge cancers whose
ramifications of disease spread far into
national life; and the non-productive inha-
bitants whom they nourish are' supported,
at the cost of the primary industries
of the community. In our overgrown
cities health and strength are sapped ;
the habit of productive labour is lost;
and the character of the people sensibly
deteriorates. For every growth of Sydney
or Melbourne, for every clerk added to
the immense civil service, the producing
industries of the country must sooner or
later pay unless the loan bill is met
by insolvency. The city tribe of clerks
and similar employees is the last class
which should be encouraged to increase.
Every one of them has to be carried on
the back of some struggling farmer or
miner or stock-raiser. And the cities
hitherto have been continually cockered
and pampered at the expense of the
country towns and the country settlers.
The first essential of national life, as of
individual life, is self-preservation; and
the way for a nation to preserve itself
is to engage as many as possible of
its people in the actual production of
food and natural wealth immediately
convertible into food. The first business
of the Commonwealth, for many years
to come, will be the transference of popu-
lation from city to country, where in-
dependent homesteads can be established;
and the deliberate starvation of endow-
ments to the cities that the country may
be fed. If our cancers are not extir-
pated, they may yet destroy the nation.
* * * »
Next in importance to the preservation
of national life is the preservation of the
race, the purification of the national
blood. This also is a vital necessity, to
which schemes of commerce and industry
must always rank second. The mixed
British breed on which we build our race
is as good a breed, on the whole, as
any to be found ; and for all men who
are fit to be merged in it the Common-
wealth should have a welcome. But,
living,as we do on the border of Asia, we
are always exposed to the danger of
Asiatic incursions, and it is certain that
the establishment of Asiatic settlements,
or of a Eurasian breed, will tend to de-
grade and destroy the white breed and
the white Commonwealth. The South
Sea Islander is similarly barred from
Australian citizenship. To good Asiatics
and South Sea Islanders bad whites
may be inferior; but the white
races have won from the centuries
a possibility of development along
their own lines which is not shared
by the Asiatic or the Islander. Nothing
at all—no question of local profit or tem-
porary advantage—should be permitted
to interfere with the vital and permanent
necessity of preserving Australia for
white Australians.
* * • *
The third abiding principle of states-
manship for the Commonwealth is the
principle of the equalisation of fortunes.
A proletariat has no reason to be patriotic.
In Australia we have not yet reached the
extremes of wealth and poverty to be
seen in elder nations; but the division
between rich and poor tends to increase,
and already we have a numerous class of
paupers living from hand to mouth, and
dependent on chance employment for
subsistence. Good government can do
much to level the disparity of classes. It
cannot make all men equal, but it can
give to all equal opportunities as far as
the sphere of government extends. The
Commonwealth can tax the rich for the
benefit of the poor, and ensure to some
extent a re-distribution of wealth at each
generation. It can place education within
the reach of all, capital within the reach
of the industrious—always with the aim
of making as many of its citizens as pos-
sible their own employers, independent of
wages. And this without thwarting en-
terprise or hampering real progress.
* * * *
These three principles are principles of
statesmanship, which should • always be
borne in mind, however the ship of state
may tack to catch a prevalent wind of
trade or politics. Everything else is sub-
ordinate. The mechanism of government
may alter from time to time ; but the
objects of government must always be
national existence, racial preservation,
and a national prosperity in which every
citizen may share in proportion to his
desert. And if these objects be reason-
ably well attained, it will be possible to
justify all the enthusiasm to which the
establishment of the Commonwealth has
given birth by proving to nearly every
individual in the community that Pat-
riotism. Pays.

As the years roll on the old-established
business of W. H. Paling & Co. continues to in-
crease, and the firm now occupies 48,000 square
feet of floor space. The firm are the largest
importers of pianos in Australasia ; sometimes
three ships, following each other at week or two
intervals, will bring 400 pianos to Paling & Co.
Makers include such well-known names as Stein-
way, Brinsmead, Lipp and Son, Feurich, Ecke,
Victor, and Belling. The firm’s third floor is
entirely taken up with the smaller class of musical
instruments—violins, guitars, banjos, polyphons,
musical boxes and band instruments. Paling’s
are agents for organs by Estey and Co. and Story
and Clark, and can supply elegant models at low
prices, suitable for churches, drawing-room, school,
or open-air services. Paling’s carry everything in
the musical line, and country visitors will find it
very enjoyable to pay Paling’s a visit.*

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Babies in the Bush.
They trotted away from the homestead fair,
Ere the leaves in the noon-tide drooped •
They trotted along by the stockyard bare,
And under the rails they stooped ;
Each chubby brown hand “lest a bad wind
bio wed ”
Held fast to a sailor hat —
They had begged to go “where the daisies
growed ”
And the buttercups out on the flat.
Oh, sing me a song of a fairy bright,
Of a spirit the bell-birds know,
That guides the feet of the lost aright,
Or carries them up thro’ the starry night
Where the bush-lost babie3 go.
We wander away as our fortune needs,
When our feet are strong to roam ;
But what is the spirit that always leads
The toddler’s feet from home ?
A belt of timber, and, miles beyond.
The awful scrubs aglow—
Oh, plead in prayer that it is not there
. That the bush-lost babies go !
We thought of the tales that the bush can tell,
As the awful suns went round —
“And we’ll find those babies asleep and well
As bush-lost babes are found.”
We searched all night and we searched all day,
We searched thro’ the broiling week,
But never a sign of a baby’s foot
Was found by that lonely creek.
The mother waits ’neath the noon-tide glare,
And under the midnight skies,
Till the wild fixed look of a life’s despair
Comes into her hopeless eyes.
But the strong man kneels by her side and turns
Her face from the clearing bare,
To the stars above, with a husband’s love—
And “ Our bush-lost babes are there ! ”
And she sings in her heart of a fairy bright,
Of a spirit the bell-birds know,
To guide the feet of the lost aright
And lead them on to a land of light
Where the bush-lost babies go.

HENRY LAWSON.
In Thule.
“ There was a king in Thule,”
And so the legends say,—
Who loved his mistress truly,
For ever and for aye.
There was a king in Thule,
And he would constant be;
There is a king in Thule,
In Thule, ’cross the sea.
And when the red sun, splendid,
The gate of dawn unbars,
And when the scroll unended
Is opened of the stars,
He sits still drinking, lonely,
And in his fancy he
His true-beloved only
For evermore may see.
Before, and aye behind him,
The tide of life may pass,
If but his vision find him
Her dead face in the glass !
N.s.w.

To spend the afternoon of Xmas day
pleasantly, get all your friends together in a

that matters will go very cheerily till the bell
rings.
" Edson ” : Flit Kin had a wife. Perhaps
it would be more correct to say that Flit Kin’s
wife had him. Flit Kin was a small, worried
Chow, and his frau was a tough lump of an Irish-
woman, who ran him unmercifully and had
merely married him in order to have a good mate
to assist her in her mining operations. Mary was
a great alluvial digger, and knew the business as
well as any man on the Piper. She worked hard
herself, and made Kin work harder, and Kin sub-
mitted meekly, like a man without a soul, even
when the wife of his bosom landed him in the ribs
with a pick-handle, or prodded him with the
sluicing-fprk. One day I stood by the windlass
while Flit Kin was hauling dirt, waiting for Mrs.
Flit Kin to come to the surface. Presently the
missus gave a signal, and Flit started to haul. The
hole was a shallow one, and looking down I saw
Mrs. Kin’s face coming up out of the shadow
with wide eyes and protruding tongue. “ Lower
away ! Lower away !” I yelled. “ You’ve got
her round the neck ! ” Flit Kin looked at me
dully, and lowered again without any particular
haste. Then, when it was slack rope and I was
starting down, he said, with effective pantomime,
“ Lope loun’ my missy neck, all a-same hang ? ”
“Yes,” I answered. He looked at me with pro-
found reproach —“ Whaffoh you no’ min’ you own
dam business ? ” he said.

Yankee Doodle at the Front!
An incident in the Boer war as related by a returned Officer.
'Kk regiment of our Australian infantry was travelling (as depicted in
the smaller photograph) to Belmont. At Graspan we were
xzc
entertained by the
garrison of Gordon
Highlanders sta-
tioned there, and
when taking our
departure by rail
were accorded the
customary musical
send - off by the
garrison band,
which, on this occa-
sion, consisted of
two drummers and
a piper. As our
train moved off I
heard the cry on
all sides from our
boys —‘ Yankee Doodle !! ’ ‘ Yankee Doodle !! ’ and there in the distance
was an almost exact representation of the Yankee Doodle tobacco brand
so familiar to all Australians. The band after seeing us aboard were
returning back along the road to camp, and as we passed they sturdily
marched and played, whilst we, with the familiar tableau before us
reminding us so of home, cheered wildly. I instantly took out my kodak,
and, although the train was moving fast, secured a fairly good picture,
with the idea that perhaps my friends (the Dixsons) in Australia would like
to have it. On many a weary march afterwards, when smoking the army
regulation tobacco, did we long for just one pipe of the old far-off favorite.”

Time.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
" Who painted Time with beard of white
And snows upon his head ?
He hath, in sooth, not painted right,”
The mourning Poet said.
Time is a Housemaid, young and fair,
Clear-eyed, with cheeks abloom,
Who, in the House of Joy-and-Care,
Toils ever with her broom.
Without the House of Joy-and-Care,
Without the open door,
A Narrow Box it standeth there
For aye and evermore.
And Virgin Time, along the Hall
Of this dull House of Life,
With ready broom she sweepeth all
Our sorrows and our strife.
The Narrow Box it holdeth well
The laughter and the tears ;
The Narrow Box it holdeth well
The Dust of all the years.
N.S.W.
E. J. BRADY.
McBride’s Bay Mare.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I once ’ad a ’oss,” said Mcßride, “ an’ she was
a bay mare an’ a fair cow, an’ no mistake.
“ She belonged to Jimmy Dow afore I ’ad ’er,
an’ he gave five-ten an’ an old plough for ’er, un-
broken. .
“Jimmy warn’t a bad sort, considering but he
jseter cuss something terrible, an’ when he wanted
that old ’oss ter go he useter cuss like mad.
“By-an’-by the old ’oss kinder got useter
this, an’ she wouldn’t go till yer cussed like mad.
Then Jimmy got in ter the habit of cussing all
along —just like other coves ’ud whistle an’ sing ;
so the old ’oss got kinder useter this too, an’ no
matter how ’ard ye was going, she’d stop as dead
as a door-nail the minute yer stopped cussing !
“Well, one wet season, when Jimmy an’two
other coves was bringin’ a mob over the border,
Jimmy got an abscess under ’is tooth, an’ every
time he’d open his mouth ter cuss, it useter give
him reg’lar jip, an’ as soon as he’d shut it an’ start
moanin’ the ole ’oss ’ud stop dead.
“ ’E cussed his head the size of a pumpkin fust
lay, an’ couldn’t open it the next, so them two
loves takes it in turns ter cuss the ole ’oss along.
“Fust Ned ’ud cuss a mile, an’ then Ted’ud
cuss a mile, an’ Jimmy ’ud be groanin’ and cussin’
till they gets ter Bourke.
“When they’d got them cattle yarded them
coves cleared, an’ Jimmy, knowin’ ’e ain’t fit ter
cuss ’ome ag’in, comes ter me.
“ I didn’t know nothin’ about that cuss dodge
then ; so when ’e arsts eight quid fer her, I beats
im down ter seven-ten an’ a bottle of whisky fer
’e’s tooth.
“ Well, I didn’t use ’er for a few days, ’n then
when I gets on she wouldn’t budge an inch. So I
starts cussin’ like mad, an’ as soon as I rips out
the first Word, orff she goes like a good ’un ; so,
seein’ ’ow well she goes, I stops, ’n’ she stops, an’ I
, falls right over her ears.
“ When I gits on ag’in I cusses pretty fair, an’
the more I cusses the more she goes, an’ we did
the five mile ter Boulton’s in no time.
“ ‘ Noo ’oss ? ’ sez Boulton ter me.
“ ‘ Yaas ! ’ sez I.
“ ‘ I think I know that ’oss,’ sez ’e, and ’e starts
cussin’ like mad an’ me an’ the ole ’oss goes like
, ’ell.
“When I gits back ’e tells me all about her ’an
when I knowed, I could er cussed ’er ten mile as
easy as drinkin’ beer.
“ When I starts ’ome ag’in I ’ad a fair cow of a
time. I was tired an’ couldn’t cuss more’n a
hundred yards, ’n’ then I’d stop, an’ she’d stop, an’
we’d take a rest, an’ then I’d cuss another
hundred, an’ then she’d stop agen, an’ we’d take
another spell, an’ if yer counts how many hundred
yards it’s from ’ere to Boulton’s yer’ll find ’ow
many spells we had afore we got ’ome.
“After that, when the kids ’ud be in bed and
I uhe missus ’ud be out yarnin’ at Green’s, I useter
go up into the loft and start practisin’ a five-mile
cuss. It was terrible ’ard work that, an’ it took
me three hours four nights a week afore I could
cuss seven-thirty-five, which was her time for the
five mile, if yer cussed middlin, without stoppin’.
“D’yer know that parson—the Baptist cove?
Well, ’e came over ter my place one day, an’ I
seen ’e’s gone on the ole ’oss as soon ’e spots ’er.
“ ‘ That’s a fine ’oss, Mr. Mac.,’ sez ’e.
“ ‘ Yes,’ sez I, ‘an’ she’s as good as she looks ! ’
“ ‘ I wanter buy a good ’oss, Mr. Mac.,’ sez ’e.
“ ‘ Ten quid on the table an’ she’s yourn,’ sez I.
“Well, ’e wanted ter see ’er paces, an’ so I
sticks ’im on the verandah an’ starts the ole ’oss
about a ’undred yards away, so’s ’e couldn’t ’ear,
an’ then starts cussin’, an’ the ole ’oss starts goin’
like blue-murder.
“‘Fine, very fine indeed,’ sez ’e, after I’d
finished. ‘l’ll take her at yer own figger,’ sez
’e, an’ ’e sticks the money on the table.
“ Well, when ’e changes saddles with ’is other
’oss, ’e gets on. ‘Now, me beauty ! ’ sez ’e ; ‘be
orff,’ sez ’e, an’ shakes the reins like this ; but she
wouldn’t budge.
“ ‘ Oh ! but you must, now,’ sez ’e ; ‘ you really
nust,’ sez ’e, an’ gives ’er a dig ; but she didn’t
take no notice, but jist ’angs ’er ’ead like a weepin’
willow what’s tired.
“ ‘ ’Ow’s this ? ’ sez ’e. ‘ She’s a jibber,’ sez ’e.
“ ‘No,’ sez I; ‘she ain’t,’ sez I.
“ ‘ Why don’t she go then ? ’ sez ’e.
“ ‘ That’s a pe-cule-er-arity ov ’ers,’ sez I.
“ "Ow?’ sez ’e.
“ ‘Yer ’ave ter cuss,’ sez I.
“ ‘ Cuss ?’sez’e.
“ ‘Yes,’ sez I, an’ I showed ’im ’ow, an’ him an’
the ole ’oss goes down the road like a ’ot wind.
“You oughter seen his face when ’e comes back
; leadin’ the ole ’oss an’ lookin’ blacker nor a
nigger.
I “‘D’yer mean ter inform me,’ sez’e, ‘as this
yer ’oss won’t go till yer swear at ’er V sez ’e.
“ ‘Fact,’ sez I.
“ ‘ Ver-il-y,’ sez ’e, ‘ this ’ere ’oss is a himp of
Satan ! ’
“ ‘ You’re wrong,’ sez I (fer I ’ad ’er papers in-
side) ; ‘ she’s outer Polly Brooks by Randulf ; ’
but ’e didn’t seem ter know that breed —leastways
he didn’t take no notice.
“ ‘ You must take ’er back,’ sez ’e.
“ ‘ Why ? ’ sez I.
| “ ‘ I’ll prossy-cute yer with false pretences ! ’
“ ‘ Well,’sez I, considerin’, ‘l’ll trive yer eight
quid fer ’er an’ say no more about it,’ sez I.
“ ’E argyfied a bit, but I got round ’im all right;
but when ’e went ’e got regular mad, an’ sez ’e :
‘ Yer a fittin’ pair,’ sez he, ‘ an’ it’s well fer ’osses
iher ain’t no after-life fer them ! ’ sez ’e.
“I think he was a bit ratty ! ” said Mcßride.

The Westralian Forestry Department,
learning one of the best lessons its neighbor,
South Australia, has to teach, is distributing
parcels of seed of the date-palm for experimental
sowing north of the Murchison. The idea is to
hand out packets to prospectors and others going
far afield, with the request to drop a seed or two
at every likely-looking spring or pool or “ soak.”
In eight or ten years plants should be in bearing.
A very good plan adopted by the explorers and
early surveyors of far-west N.S.W. and South
Queensland was to similarly distribute melon and
pumpkin seeds. The melons, even down to late
times, have kept many a droughty traveller on his
legs, while the pumpkins have been the mainstay
of several shearers’ strike-camps.
“ Living water” is the most appropriate descrip-
tion that can be given of the wonderful diamonds on dis-
play at the Goldsmiths and Silversmiths Alliance, 90
King-st., Sydney. Their Xmas exhibit this year far sur-
passes all previous efforts. The Alliance wish to call
attention to their Souvenirs in commemoration of the
Australian Commonwealth, which comprise an immense
variety of miniature photographic medallions, set in solid
gold and crystal glass, containing life-like photos, of their
Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York, Lord
and Lady Hopetoun, and the leading celebrities of the
Commonwealth. They are also exhibiting their most
novel Registered Commonwealth Souvenirs, which have
been manufactured in the form of silver and gold
Brooches, Pendants, Hat Pins, Cuff Links, Shoe Lifts,
Seals, Match Boxes, Belt Clasps, Sugar Tongs, Berry
Forks, and Souvenir Spoons. The Goldsmiths and Silver-
smiths Alliance cordially invite visitors to Sydney during
Xmas holidays to inspect their latest novelties in Watches,

Nothing Done.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The whare looked very dirty. Its filth was un-
romantic, and the black pig which sunned its
belly at the doorway might have been taken for
the figurative Beast.
There was the usual porch, painted originally a
sickly yellow, but stained by wind and smoke to
a color that in human complexion we call “bad
liver.”
Buxton, an exceedingly cleanly young man,
plainly showed his displeasure and stepped
forward with Agag-like delicacy. The occupants
of the porch favored him with an apathetic stare.
“Tenakoe, pakeha !” whined the woman.
“A d— Englishman!” growled the man.
“ Hullo, you there ! Don’t put your confounded
feet on Pompey.”
Buxton apologised for disturbing the pig, and
nervously pulled down his shirt-cuffs. The back-
blocks were new to him, and the greeting of the
Pakeha-Maori was strange to the usages of Pall
Mall.
Meanwhile, the man and woman continued
smoking impassively, and the pig luxuriously
turned over in the mud.
“I —er—in fact,” began Buxton.
“Am a trespasser,” continued the man, rudely.
‘ Perhaps, but only by accident. I lost my
way—got into a road that led to nowhere.”
“I have heard my estate”—the man waved his
hand with a sarcastic gesture, indicating the
quarter-acre clearing—“ called many names, but
your title is certainly the most original ? Martha ”
—he turned to the woman —“Martha, you dirty
daughter of a dago dog, your respected husband’s
estate is termed ‘ Nowhere !’ ” He abused the
woman without raising his voice, in a calm, mono-
tonous way, as if to curse her was a weary duty,
and, the task finished, he questioned Buxton.
“ Who sent you here ? The loafers at the pub. ?
Or was it that white-livered skunk of a parson,
who’s afraid to face even my poor little Martha ? ”
The woman grinned, and showed a fine set of
teeth. Buxton shook his head, wonderingly.
“No. I don’t quite understand you. I lost my
way, that is all.”
“So, you’re not a Joshua, come to spy
out a blot on civilisation ? And, by the way, I
suppose you don’t carry any cheap jewellery or
beads on your person, because, if you do .
That’s only chaff. I know you don’t. Here,
Martha, bring the chair for our distinguished
European visitor.”
The woman rose to her feet, displaying a big,
heavy-boned figure. The outlines of her fleshy bust
and limbs clearly showed beneath the thin cotton
blouse and skirt which draped them, and her feet
were bare, as were the man’s. She plunged into
the darkness of the whare, presently returning
with a wooden kitchen chair.
“You hardly appreciate the honor,” remarked
the man. “That is my chair of state. When I
am quite sober—which happens possibly twice a
year—l sit in my chair and try to imagine that I
am a white man again. Occasionally I use it to
knock Martha down with, for which reason I
think you will find one of the legs somewhat
groggy- I notice,” he continued, “ that you have
let your pipe go out. I would advise you to
smoke ; strangers sometimes regard the odor of
rotten shark as rather overpowering. It’s a
matter of habit. I expect I should equally dis-
like caviare—now.”
Buxton lit his pipe gratefully. “Look here,”
he said, hesitatingly, “I don’t know your name,
and I’m not enquiring into your business—but,
damn it all, man, you needn’t make things worse
than they are. You know what I mean. You’re
—you’re just trying to exaggerate the concern.”
“ Thanks,” said the man slowly ; “you’re white,
and we’ll drop the play-acting biz altogether.
Martha, you slut, clear. This talk is pakeha.”
When the woman had gone the men smoked a
while in silence.
Then the Pakeha-Maori: “ Varsity man ? ”
“Yes. John’s, Oxford.”
“Ah ! I’m a Balliol.”
After which another relapse of energetic
smoking.
“A tourist?”
“No. Dabble in black-and-white line. Just
now I’m working up illustrations for a globe-
trotter who’s caught the pen-fever.”
The man blew clouds of smoke more energeti-
cally.
“ Funny thing, that. Some time or other I was
in the same line myself. As far as I can make
out it must be twenty years ago.”
“Ever do anything now?” queried Buxton
with interest.
“ Yes, when I’m sober. That’s perhaps twice a
year, as I told you before, and, strange to say, the
fit’s on now.” From inside his shirt he pulled out
a small drawing-book and handed it to Buxton.
“Just filled it, and to-morrow I shall burn it.
Funny, isn’t it?”
Buxton opened the book, and, with close atten-
tion, turned the leaves. It was five minutes
before he had finished, and he still held the book
in his hands, almost reverently.
“Good God ! man,” he said, excitedly, “d’you
know what this is? It’s genius—downright
genius! They’re rough, some of them—but,
Caesar, they’re great! If I could do that work I’d
have my country-house and a yacht in a few years’
time. Why, you’ll be the rage in no time. Come
away from this place, and you’ll ”
“ Never do anything! Never did, never shall,
never can ! ”
“But you have ! ” cried Buxton, holding up the
book.
“ That will be gone to-morrow,” said the man,
quietly. “It will go with my soul. My soul
that sits up in the trees somewhere, and mocks
and jeers and laughs at me. It says * You
beast, you shameless low animal, would you claim
what is mine. Burn it, tear it, destroy it. You
never did it. You never could. You sold
your birthright years ago drunkard, sot
that you are; and now you would steal mi/
property. So, you see, I burn the book, and
my soul is satisfied and says ‘ now you may drink
and lie in the dirt, and accept Martha’s
and—be happy ! ’ Of course, this is all rot and
rubbish, but it seems real to me—nerves bad, I
suppose—and—and I can’t get away from it.”
Buxton looked at him hopelessly.
“Consider,” he said, falteringly, “what the
world loses through your scruples.”
“Loses!” answered the man. “Loses the
sight of genius degraded. I think it may recover
the loss.”
Buxton looked at the book in his hands with an
expression on his face easy to read.
“You would like it ? ” said the man. “ I will
make a deal with you. I’ll sell one page at a
price.”
“ How much ? ” queried Buxton.
“ I’ll take payment in kind—one page—any one
page—for a case of fizz—the genuine article—and
three bottles of three-star. The other fit’s coming
on, and I’d like to taste King’s Peg again.”
Buxton carefully selected a page and tore it out
of the book. “It’s a bargain,” he said; “I’ll
take this one, and send you the stuff down from
Auckland.”
“ A coincidence,” murmured the man, looking
at the torn-out page. “That’s Martha’s father
on the spree.”
* * • •
Six months later Buxton revisited the whare.
It was empty, and in the corner of the clearing
some neatly-cut characters on a small board
announced the reason :
H. G. H.
Died of King’s Peg.

RDOAR M. DELL.
My First and Last Tenant.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The agent explained to me that the occupant of
the house he was about to let—gazing at me with
ophidian eyes—would be suzerain of a house in the
next allotment. A fence ran between the two
residences. The house I was looking at was a
small, squat, sturdy cottage, with chimneys like
corkscrews, and, though up to its knees in accumu-
lated dirt and dust and general detritus, carried
an expression of dogged insobriety which pleased
me greatly. There are also in its construction
the evident signs of sudden happy thoughts—all
different and all contradictory—on the part of the
builder. Steps and passages led into rooms which
seemed to have no purpose. One room I remember
more than the others. It had no window ; it had
no fireplace ; it had no apparent reason for being
at all, and yet it had a distinct aliveness —the dull,
helpless, but malignant look which appears in all
things that man has deserted. The verandah had
a trellis, and over the trellis trailed an aged vine
that held out three—l counted them —bunches of
white grapes. Banksia roses ran over the trellis
and curved their slender arms around the dead-
brown branches of the vine. The impression was
of Anacreon very old and poor, but still proudly
and gravely drunk, rising suddenly out of his
quiet Grecian grave into a new plug-hatted world.
I saw all this, and, of course, the agent had me
in his hands. “That tree in the backyard,” I
observed, “is a fine tree.” It was a tall, mourn-
ful willow tree.
“Yes,” said the agent, “itis a fine tree —a very
fine tree.”
“ That branch, though—the one that hangs over
the little pool—is picturesque enough, but rather
cumbrous, don’t you think ? ”
The agent smiled pensively.
“ That branch has a history,” he said. “The
last tenant of this cottage—he was a jeweller by
trade, name of Lyons—tried to hang himself from
that branch. People next door cut him down
just in time.”
I took the house at once.
* * * «
The little cottage next-door was one of those
dwellings which are rarely seen off the operatic
stage and outside the drawing-books for beginners.
It was simply smothered in white roses, and even
from the chimney a daring rose shook a laughing
head in the air.
“You will, of course, collect the rent for this
place,” said the agent.
“ Of course,” I remarked.
I began to understand the feeling of Property.
I belonged to the Landlord Class.
* * * *
A week after I had taken the house my wife
was fortunate enough to find a tenant for the
cottage.
“ Artist! ” I said, thinking of the white roses.
No j rabbit-seller,” she replied. “His horse
is in the front yard.”
So it was—eating the roses.
Presently the Owner of the Horse appeared. A
weasel-faced man with shifty eyes.
“ Discarded jockey, or groom,” I said to myself.
I was wrong about the jockey—right about the
groom. He curried and caressed that old sphinx-
headed horse, and cooed to it, and made a whist-
ling sound—peculiar to grooms but apparently
much appreciated by horses—through his teeth.
“ Good fellow,” I said to myself again. “Ani-
mals know.” I thought so then. I now think
that they know a great deal more than is good for
them.
I opened a bottle of claret—9s. 6d. per dozen—
to celebrate the occasion.
My new tenant and I drank success to each
other. He did not presume, and I kept my pride
in hand. I felt as though I were a Squire talking
affably to one of his tenant-farmers.
I may say that I had paid a woman to scrub the
place all over. A previous occupant—one who is
now moving in larger circles—had painted his coat-
of-arms and written the motto of his family over
the kitchen fire-place. The good, honest hired
woman assiduously scrubbed coat-of-arms and
motto away. But the cottage was indubitably
clean.
I was in town that day and was talking to some
Bohemians—men whom I used to like as boon
companions and I told them that I was no longer
a Revolutionist or a hater of the Patman. Even
the Patman had responsibilities and excuses for
living.
Nevertheless, I was quite serious, and looked at
those good-hearted fine fellows—clever and bright
in their own way, but knowing nothing of busi-
ness or the Responsibilities of Capital—with a com-
passionate eye.
“ The question of landlord and tenant is as old
as the legend of the Garden of Eden,” said the
Cynic, stroking his grizzled beard. “Ifl am not
mistaken, you said last Saturday that landlords
were the scum of the earth.”
Well, Iliad said something of the kind, but he
is a poor sort of man who cannot occasionally
alter his mental point of view, and reconstruct his
horizon.
It might be good enough for them to sit guzzling
beer in a hotel, but a landlord has better business
in hand. I left them, and went home to look
after my property. Six shillings a week was the
rent of the cottage covered with roses.
The first week’s rent was paid in rabbits.
That was right enough. A man with a family
can always use rabbits, in one fashion or another.
The second week’s rent was paid in rabbits.
Toujours perdrix !
Then there was no more rent.
I was walking around my property one morning,
smoking and thinking that, after all, it was a
devil of a business to be a landlord. And then,
looking out from the window of my cottage, I saw
a face with curled chestnut hair and wonderful
laughing hazel eyes.
I went into my cottage and asked if any repairs
were necessary. Could Ido anything at all ?
The lady was the wife of the rabbit-seller, and
she was one of the prettiest women I had ever
seen. I considered that she was quite thrown
away on the weasel-faced man.
Six weeks more and no rent. I was in debt
myself, Ihe lady and her weasel-faced husband
were at my back-door explaining why they could
not pay me my rent regularly. The husband
offered me an ancient barraeouta as something off
the account.
“ I know these excuses,” I said. “ I have no
doubt that you mean well—but what am Ito do
in the meantime ? The barraeouta you offer me
is, no doubt, a good, respectable fish, but I cannot
use it as an asset. Kish is not currency with the
people I deal with ? ”
The couple seemed distressed, but I set my
mouth and made myself stern. “Itresolves itself
into a question of paying—or going,” I said,
stiffening my shoulders against the back-door.
And the woman with the pretty hazel eyes, and
the weasel-faced man implored me to give them a
little more time and not carry tilings to extremes.
At that same moment, at the front door, my
wife was - making the same old excuses to the
agent.
“It’s no use,” I heard him say, “My friend
must make a call on you.”
Hib friend was the bailiff—and he called.
Next morning when I went out with the
bailiff—he knew me—for a drink, I saw that my
tenant had gone, and had taken with him all the
roses that covered the cottage, and every lock
from every door, and every bit of iron, or lead, or
brass, he could lay his hands upon.
I have had many bailiffs since then, but no more
tenants.

Marble and Mire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We were daring in our Springtime, for we left the
lands of old,
And we laughed at myth and mystic and the
legendary gold,
And the faith our fathers cherished, we dismissed
it with a jeer,
As a feeble thing and futile for the days that drew
a-near;
And we boasted in our puissance we would fashion
things anew,
Till a world of whitest wonder into vision round
us grew;
We would turn to fairest temple ev’ry dream of
our desire,
We would build a State of marble from a people
made of mire !
O, the cities of our vision—o, the castles of our
dream !
0, the spires that kissed the heavens and were
mirrored in the stream !
0, the laughing Peaks of Morning—o, the loving
lands of Day ;
And the clasped hands of nations that forgot to
fight and slay !
0, the cannon that we buried with the helmet and
the spear !
0 the grave wherein we covered ancient Mammon
with his gear!
0 the gods who laughed above us when they saw
the fools aspire
To the lifting up of marble when their hands are
filled with mire !
And the Sun beheld us toiling in his splendour as
he rose,
And the Day beheld us moiling all aweary at his
close,
And the Moon in gentle pity looked upon us sweet
and far :
(She had seen the Tower of Babel that should kiss
with yonder star.)
And the sages, who were watching with a wonder
in their eyes,
In the’r kindness to our blindness would admonish
and advise,
But we bade them wait a moment till we brought
the glory nigher,
Till we wrought a state of marble with a people
made of mire.
We are weak and we are weary—and our grief has
left us gray,
And the glories that we dreamt of are but pun>
heaps of clay,
And the men we thought of raising have but
spurned us with their feet,
And our noblest and our bravest have been stoned
in yonder street ;
And our broad and deep foundations were uprent
with pick and bar,
And the people clamoured— “ Leave us ! we are
happy as we are ! ”
And the axe was ever o’er us with the scourge and
with the fire—
We had dared to think of marble when the souls of
men were mire I
There were gentle souls who loved us, but we left
them sad and lone,
That the work might wax and prosper and the
goodly seed be sown ;
And they died in desolation, for the land was
waste and seie,
When we did not heed the calling of the gentle
hearts and dear;
But the weary world is left us with its scoffing
and its scorn,
With its chilling shades of Even and its memories
of Morn,
And the temple we were building is a burnt and
blackened pyre—
O, the curse of craving marble when the hearts of
men are mire !

A PAGE OF VERSES WRITTEN FOR “THE BULLETIN.”
Proletaria.
The sunny rounds of Earth contain
An obverse to its Day,
Our fertile Vagrancy’s domain,
Wan Proletaria.
From pole to pole of Poverty
We stumble through the years,
With hazy-lanterned Memory
And Hope-that-never-nears.
Wherever Plenty’s crop invites
Our pitiful brigades,
Lurk cannoneers of Vested Rights,
Juristic ambuscades.
And here hangs Rent, that squalid cage
Within which Mammon thrusts,
Bound with the fetter of a wage,
The helots of his lusts.
With palsied Doubt as guide, we wind
Among the lanes of Need,
Where meagre Hungers scouting find
But slavered baits of Greed.
The wet-lipped Lamia’s of Caste,
Awaiting our advance,
Our choicest squadrons’ fealty blast
With magic smile and glance :
Delilah-limbed temptations flit
Among our drowsy rows,
And on our willing captains fit
The badges of our foes.
What wonder sometimes if in stealth
Our starker outposts wait,
And, in the prowling eyes of Wealth,
Dash vitriol of Hate !
Or if our Samsons, ere too late,
Their treasons should make good,
By whelming in the temples’ fate
Their viper owners' brood !
Our polyandrous dam has borne
To Satan and to God
The hordes of Night, the clans of Morn,
That through our valleys plod.
Ah, motherhood of misery
For Christ-child as for pest !
The more her womb’s fertility
The drier grows her breast !
Too many linger on the track ;
A few outstrip the time ;
Some, God has tattooed yellow, black,
And some disguised with crime.
Art’s living archives here abound,
Carraras of Despair,
And those weird masks of Sight and Sound
The Tragic Muses wear.
Tho’ blind and dull, ’tis we supply
The painter’s dazzling dreams ;
The rolling flood of poetry
From our dumb chaos streams.
Nay, when your world is over-tired,
And Genius comatose,
Our race, by Nemesis inspired,
Old Order overthrows.
With earthquake-life we thrill your land,
Refill the cruse of Art,
Revitalise spent Wisdom, and
Resume our weary part.
The palace of successful Guilt
Is mortared with our shame;
On hecatombs of Us are built
The soaring towers of Fame.
We are the gnomes of Titan works
Whose throbbings never cease ;
Our unregarded signet lurks
On every masterpiece.
The floating isles, that shuttling tie
All peoples into one
By adept steersmen’s sorcery
Of magnet, steam, and sun ;
Religion’s hypocritic spires
And printed armouries;
The Helot lightning of the wires
That mesh your lands and seas ;
The viaducts ’tween Near and Far,
Whereon, o’er range and mead,
B icchantic Trade’s triumphal car
And iron tigers speed ;
The modern steely crops that rise
Where Technic Jasons sow :
—All these but feebly symbolise
The largesse we bestow.
And our reward ? In this wan land,
In clientage of Greed,
Despised, polluted, maimed, and banned,
To wander and —to breed.

Kyr ielle: Of Her Eyes.
The room was dim. The lazy, flickering fire
Threw gleams of shadow, but few gleams of light;
Outside, the night-winds murmured menace dire.
Only her eyes—her sweet, moist eyes—were
bright.
We kissed and clung, and clung and kissed again ;
Our hearts made music to our souls’ despite.
My broken life lay languishing in pain . . .
Only her eyes—her sweet, moist eyes—were
bright.
“ To-night we love, to-morrow part. The rest ?
Who cares ! Nothing remains beyond to-night ! ”
She sobbed in answer, lying on my breast:
Only ... her eyes—her sweet, moist eyes—were
bright.
“ My soul is yours, my body, Love ! ” she cried.
“ Joy lingers with us till to-morrow’s light! ”
She wept and whispered love-words by my side;
Only her eyes—her sweet, moist eyes—were
bright.
So in ray arms she lay till Dawn peeped through
The blinds —Dawn with all miseries bedight.
She went, and took with her all hope I knew . . .
Only her eyes—her sweet, moist eyes—were
bright.
At noon she came again, and consciously
Flung to my ready arms . . . depth of delight !
Her face was pale. Her lips moved tremulously.
Only her eyes—her sweet, moist eyes—were
bright.
“For you,” she said, “ I give up all of good
That women prize, save love ; in all men’s sight
An outcast! ” And she trembled as she stood :
Only her eyes—her sweet, moist eyes—were
bright.

The Glory-Call.
They sat at wine, their eyes aglow,
Impassioned, large, and fierce with heat,
Nor heard the moments come and go
With soft and unresisting feet.
He sat with them, his beard adrip
With slowly-gathering golden dew ;
And evermore his burning lip
He quenched in yellow wine, and drew
A grea-t breath in, as though some fate
Had snatched him from uncouth desire.
All round about his comrades sate
With wine-drenched hands and eyes of fire.
Great sweetness thrilled them, and on love
They lingered, each strong life astart
With some old anguish close enwove
In the red tissue of its heart.
Power surged them, and they felt the strength
Of some lean lion in the grey,
Grey dusk that hurls his tawny length
Far forth upon the reeling prey.
One cursed the subtle clinging vine
That robbed his soul of wholesome breath ;
One swayed afoot with lifted wine
And drank derisively to Death.
White women names that shone serene
Above the tumbled mists of ill
Were clouded then, and Malice keen
With savage hunger ranged at will.
But ever as with laugh or sigh
They pledged and filled from eve to morn,
The cynic hours went slowly by
With sidelong eyes of ancient scorn.
He sat with them aloof and mute,
His lips compressed, his hands atwine ;
Strange scorn of self, with eye acute,
Had reft the witchery of wine.
He shook their voices from his ear,
The wine flung far—they saw it fall;
He heard bell-toned, high-raised and clear,
A Forward-Call, a Glory-Call !
He turned, but suddenly were raised
The tongues of friends with olden love
Gold-winged and sweet; soft words that praised
The rose path, and strong hands that strove.
He freed his soul; then softly in
Girl-visions floated, faces fresh
With lovesomeness and coy with sin,
Soft eyes dark-lashed and velvet flesh.
Some wound his hands with tressy train
Of scented hair, and some his heart
Assailed with song, but all in vain ;
He burst their wiles like threads apart.
Then warred the Past against his Will,
Her dagger tipped with bitter gall,
But fruitlessly; to shafts of ill
He stood an adamantine wall.
Thus forth he fared, and far behind
The revel faded ; yet a voice
Down stealing on a subtle wind
With satire stung his austere choice.
Men-ties and maid-ties, ties that wed
The world in one large love and trust,
From sudden severance dripped with red,
Till all his heart grew dry as dust.
He trod the woe-way, white and worn,
Foot-worn and white with dust of brave
Fore-stravers—led by some forlorn
But lovely hope to dare the grave.
Winds blew —he cared not; fell the rain—
He marched along with strength upstrung ;
No wine or kiss could wake again
Delicious memories on his tongue.
He kept his way, and when the years
Had wrung his soul with sobs and moans,
Came, through a wood-way dripping tears,
Unto a temple built of bones.
He entered, feeling here at least
A glory-crown should greet his eyes :
He saw instead a cowled priest,
An altar and a sacrifice.
Slow steps he made, and paused beside
The sacrifice, and strangely shook
With mortal fears, and opened wide,
Wide eyes, and, leaning downward, took
The veil away, and saw beneath
(The eyes how dim—how dull the gold !)
His slain youth there, sublime in death,
But pale and passionless and cold.
World-voices entered down the arch
Of Time defiant, with a weight
Of story—like a forest march
Of lions, dominant and great.
He heard them—heard without a sigh,
Transcendent in the light of morn . . .
But still the cynic hours went by
With sidelong eyes of ancient 3Com.

Love- Tokens.
They glitter golden in the light
Those Cupid-gifts of yore,
Pale roses that were red or white,
Dear roses that she wore ;
Her first short letter—Ah, how sweet
That word of Long Ago !
And fluttering softly to my feet
Her last—how full of woe 1
I see between the roses twine
The wraiths of buried years,
I read between each fading line
Her laughter touched with tears ;
The broken sixpence joins its mate,
The gold tress finds its sheen,
And still I watch alone and wait
With all that might have been.
As some grey-bearded man may stand
In garden pathways fair,
And say “ ’Twas here I held her hand,
Here stroked her golden hair ;
And yonder, where the larkspur grows,
And the slow brown bee sips,
That very place, ’twixt rose and rose,
I kissed her rosier lips.”
I lift the love-gifts one by one,
And move them to and fro,
To turn and ted them in the sun
That laughed on Long Ago;
With such a pride as one may feel
Who names a treasured hoard :
“ This was my mother’s spinning-wheel,
And this my father’s sword.”
Of these, long-cherishcd lovingly
Through all the lonely years,
Weave only one brown wreath for me
Twined out and in with tears,
And bring them where the myalls wave
And lay them on my breast —
Her hair, her roses in my grave
Will give me better rest.

Larva Loquitur.
Listen, among your violets and wine,
White moonbeams fighting with the lamp’s red
ray,
Away beneath yon windy, crying pine,
I stand, and watch, and call, and plead, and pray.
And you, you heed not there beneath her spell,
With violets and music, and your Love,
White-throated like the warm, white, trailorous
snow
Strayed limbs seek fainting when their hope is
low.
(Loquitur Larva l Little ghost and grey,
Poor little ghost, gone out so long ago.
Why do you fret the eve of this white day,
With your imperious whispers. Ah, no, no.)
Listen, across your happy fire-lit eyes
I pass, pass, pass. Look back. Remember me.
The fire is fading and the violets droop,
And your warm-throated Love turns, shiveringly.
I steal between you. Here I stand and pray.
Here at your side, outside the lamp’s red reach.
Fool, do you think you have forgotten me 1
I am the Ghost that you have Ceased to Be.
(Loquitur Larva ! Bitter, hitter ghost,
I laid thee sleeping many and many a year,
I smothered thee with roses, and the most
Of life's good things I heaped upon thy bier.)
Ah, but I tossed the roses to the deep,
I threw away the memory of the tear.
I rose with shaking haste from death’s dull sleep,
Shattering the rotting gifts upon my bier.
And through the moonlight and the sighing pines,
And through the wet dark gardens of your home,
I come to warn you that my sleep is o’er,
That I will leave your side no more, no more.
CLoquitur Larva ! Oh, remorseless Past l
Then all my wounds and sacrifice are vain.
I suffer, suffer, suffer —hold me fast,
Oh, woman of my sold l laugh down the pain.)
Hush, would you tell the story of your Past
To that fair face that must recoil and spurn,
And turn away, grown sudden grey and ghast,
All fairness faded, while you watch and yearn,
And cry for love and cry in vain, “ Absolve ! ”
And plead for pity she will never give,
Her love drowned deep in seas of doubt and dread.
I take your hand, and turn your heart to lead.
(Out of the Dead Years, out of Sacrifice,
Bitterly burnt on many an altar pile,
Is there no spirit-shape from Paradise
Will haunt this phantom back to Death's dark aisle!)
Lo, I have wrecked your roses and your tears,
Weak offerings to the memory of your wrong.
Deep, deep my sleep, but through the silent years
Came creeping the new cadence in your song.
Deep, deep my sleep, but through its depths your
voice
Plunged sharper than a sword, and I awoke.
Calling aloud her happy, haunting name,
You pierced my sleep until I woke, and came.
(Out of the Dead Years, out of Sacrifice,
Bitterly burnt on many an altar pile,
Is there no spirit-hand from Paradise
Will drive this phantom back to Death's dark aisle ?)
Listen, among your violets and wine,
White moonbeams striving with the lamp s red
ray,
I leave the shelter of the windy pine,
And closer creep, and closer cling, alway.
Ah, hush! . . . Why does his voice fall whispering
Into the meshes of her yellow hair . . .
(Out of the Dead Years, out of Sacrifice,
N~o hand reached down to turn thee to thy bier.
’Twas She who leaned, as if from Paradise,
And drove thee into darkness with one tear.)

The Dreamer.
The hour of beauty over, he arose
And left the house and book, and when a-nigh
The bush that follows where the streamlet goes
He heard a lamb’s faint cry.
A lonely note was in the spring-born’s bleat,
A hint of some field-sorrowing he read,
And to the stream he turned his wandering feet,
And found the mother dead.
Unpitying law, use, kindred, foul decay,
Pressed on his soul so delicate and fair :
“ Behold the dreamer cometh, let us slay! ”
Was whispered in the air.
Significant the rustle in the grass,
The sudden raising of the horned'brute head
Of hidden bull —he felt the whisper pass :
“ He cometh, lay him dead ! ”
The marsh was heavy with a storm-blue cloud,
The channel brimming full, the bridge was down,
And from far creeks and pools the voice was
loud :
“We have him, let him drown ! ”
He stood beside the river on the shore,
The reeds were straining, sad each creek and
bend,
Beyond the sandhills came the ocean roar,
He said, “ Here is the end ! ”
When, lo ! the great magician sun shone out,
The spaces of the marsh were searched with light;
Red cattle wandered ; rippled by the trout,
The pools were blue and white.
The quivering reeds set in a golden sheet
Made old Pan music, and the gums’ white boles
Were yellow-warm, and with a thundering beat
Swept-by the startled foals.
Homeward the dreamer went, his soul at rest,
Steadfast, consoled, unvext by coward fears,
And pitiful : and making to the west,
The sun burned on the Tiers.

When London Calls.
They leave us—artists, singers, all—
When London calls aloud,
Commanding to her Festival
The gifted crowd.
She sits beside the ship-choked Thames,
Sad, weary, cruel, grand ;
Her crown imperial gleams with gems
From many a land.
From overseas, and far away,
Come crowded ships and ships—
Grim-faced she gazes on them ; yea,
With scornful lips.
The garden of the earth is wide;
Its rarest blooms she picks
To deck her board, this haggard-eyed
Imperatrix.
Sad, sad is she, and yearns for mirth :
With voice of golden guile
She lures men from the ends of earth
To make her smile.
The student of wild human ways
In wild new lands ; the sage
With new great thoughts ; the bard whose lays
Bring youth to age ;
The painter young whose pictures shine
With colours magical,
The singer with the voice divine—
She lures them all.
But all their new is old to her
Who bore the Anakim ;
She gives them gold or Charon’s fare
As suits her whim.
Crowned Ogress—old, and sad, and wise—
She sits with painted face
And hard, imperious, cruel eyes
In her high place.
To him who for her pleasure lives,
And makes her wish his goal,
' A rich Tarpeian gift she gives—
That slays his soul.
The story-teller from the Isles
Upon the Empire’s rim,
With smiles she welcomes—and her smiles
Are death to him.
For Her, whose pleasure is her law,
In vain the shy heart bleeds—
The Genius with the Iron Jaw
Alone succeeds.
And when the Poet’s lays grow bland,
And urbanised, and prim
She stretches forth a jewelled hand
And strangles him.
She sits beside the ship-choked Thames,
With Sphinx-like lips apart—
Mistress of many diadems—
Death in her heart !

Nissen's Secret.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
John Westbrook, master-mariner, sailed one fine
morning out of Port Jackson on a six months’
trading cruise among the South Sea Islands, and
he never returned. His wife, having perfunctorily
waited the six months, with two months’ grace
added, and being too indifferent to make any in-
quiries, conveniently gazetted him dead, and
married Job Dixon, master-mariner, of the
schooner Neptune. In due course he sailed out of
Port Jackson on an extended cruise, and he never
returned. And the man who holds the key to the
mystery is precisely the one most oblivious of
there being any key to hold.
* * * *
The trading settlement lay bathed in brilliant
sunlight. Against the clear sky the palms were
defined to their smallest twigs. A big-boned,
pale-faced man sat on a pile of lumber by the
landing-place, and listlessly eyed a schooner that
was coming slowly up the lagoon. On the ground
behind lolled a little, shock-headed man with big,
vacant eyes and a significant droop of his nether
lip.
Two idlers strolled down from the station and
stood at a little distance.
“ Who’re they ?” queried one.
“ What! ” The other looked surprised.
“Don’t know Captain Westbrook and his man
Friday—watch-dog, body-guard, and all things in
that line ? But, then, this is your first visit to
the Gilbert Islands.”
“Well? tell me ! ”
“The story? Oh, there isn’t much of it.
Westbrook used to trade between these islands
and Sydney, but on his last visit with his ship he
took a cargo for ’Frisco. Coming back, he ran
into a breeze, and his old hulk strained so badly
that her crew had only time to take to the boats,
without food or water—or with very little —before
she went down. They moped about—l don’t
know how many days—going off by degrees till
only the captain and his familiar were left.
The little man—Nissen —was loony when the
Tortoise picked ’em up, and he’s a bit loony
now. The thing turned his brain. When
they found them, he was nursing the uncon-
scious captain, damping his head with a wet cloth,
and crooning to him one of those things the women
sing to youngsters. Now, he seems to think he
has a mission to watch over the “old man” —l
believe he thinks he’s a dog, though he doesn’t
bark. He’s always at his heels.”
“Ah! queer yarn,” the first man said, and
pointed to the schooner, which had now got an
anchor down. “ What craft’s that ? ”
“ That! Oh ! that’s the Neptune. Been
tramping about the islands a good while, this trip.
She was here a little time back. Left just before
the Tortoise brought those castaways here.”
A boat put off from the schooner, and landed
her skipper. Captain Westbrook looked after
him, nodded his head like a man who has a
thought, and strolled off up to the saloon. Nissen,
the watch-dog, followed at heel.
* * * *
“So she killed me at short notice, and married
you—eh ? ”
Captain Westbrook, grim-visaged and porten-
tous, faced the Neptune’s skipper across a table
in the saloon. Witless Nissen, excluded from
the room, stumped the verandah, disconso-
late. Captain Job Dixon, one hand drumming
the table nervously, the other thrust into his
jacket-pocket, was silent for awhile.
“ But —how did you know ? ” lie blurted at last.
The other laughed.
“Inquired,” he said. “I wanted news from
home. You were busy with the agent, so I
boarded one of your crew whom I happened to
know. He told me my wife had given me up as
dead, and married again. Married you —he said.
True, isn’t it ? ”
The Neptune’s skipper nodded.
“I took a run to ’Frisco,” Westbrook said.
“But I wrote to her, telling her of it. And she
thought I was dead ! Waited—let me see !
about eight months. Long time ! ”
“ See ! ” said Dixon, impatiently. “ This is all
rot. The woman’s right enough. I swear she
never got your letter—if you wrote one,” he added,
not so softly but that Westbrook heard.
“Don’t call me a liar,” he snarled. “I did
write. But—what are you going to do about it ?
Both can’t have the woman.”
“ No! ” Captain Job eyed the ceiling thought-
fully. “ Only one of us must go back.”
Westbrook laughed, leaned forward, and tapped
the other man on the wrist with his forefinger.
His voice, husky with the intensity of his signifi-
cance, hardly rose above a whisper.
“ You’ve said it — only one of us must go back! ”
Dixon sat bolt upright, white-faced and pal-
pably shaking, as the other’s meaning leapt into
his understanding.
“What!” he gasped. “You mean ... I
didn’t mean that ! No ! no ! ” —and he forced a
laugh. “You always were a joker, Westbrook,
and you’re at it again.”
“ I mean,” came the steady answer, “ only one
of us must go back 1 ”
“But—good heavens, man! you’re mad! I tell
you it can’t be —it’s horrible, horrible ! ”
“ Bah ! you carry a pistol, I’ll be bound, and
know how to use it, too. How often have you
used it ? ”
“Never!” said Dixon, earnestly. “Never, I
swear—on a man. Why—it’s murder ! ”
“Murder!—rubbish! we’ll fight fair. Both
can’t have her.”
“Well—well,” Dixon said, helplessly, “can’t
we arrange? . . . You don’t want her.” . . . His
voice died, and he rose to his feet.
“ You won’t have her, anyway.” Westbrook
jumped up in a rage. “ Fight, you hound, or I’ll
strangle you. Only one of us . . .”
At the threat, clinched by a swift forward
movement, coolness came to Dixon. He jerked
his right hand from his pocket, and the storming
Westbrook calmed in an instant before a menacing
revolver muzzle.
For ten seconds a life trembled on Dixon’s
trigger finger. Then he pocketed the weapon and
strode for the door.
“We’ll take a walk—you and I,” he said
through his teeth, “and ” parrot-like “only one
of us shall come back ! ”
* * • *
Nissen, still doing sentry-go on the verandah,
saw them leave, and, with an almost sane idea
that something was wrong, sneaked after them.
The two men skirted the beach till a bluff of rocks
screened them from all but very inquisitive eyes.
SHE WAS A BIT TOUGH.
MISS PASSY (old mutton dressed as lamb): “ They say the paw-paw is a wonderful tree. If you
hang up meat near it, the meat will become tender.”
MISS YOUNG : “How nice it would be to have one where you could sit in the shade of it, dear!”
Nissen scaled the bluff and dropped un-
seen behind a rock commanding a
view of the little, half-moon-shaped
battle-ground, and the
broad Sea outside.
When he lifced
his head cau-
tiously above the
rock he saw the
men facing each
other, pistols in
hand and lips
shut hard. He
gasped in dis-
may, and his
revolver, in-
stantly grin-
ning over the
rock, made the
third in the
drama ! He
d eterm in e d
the one to go
back should
not be Captain
Dixon. I
Two shots
rang as one,
echoing a score
of times in the
little amphi-
theatre, and
two billetless
bullets flatten-
ed on the
rocks. West-
brook’s hand went
up.
“ Stop!” he shout- /
ed—“this won’t do!
These cursed revolvers
sound like cannon. We’ll
have a whole pack of gap-
ing dogs from the station
down upon us in a minute.”
“Well?” said
Dixon, tensely, over
his revolver sus-
pecting a trick.
“ Why knives, of
course,” said Westbrook, dropping his pistol*
“What else did we bring ’em for?”
Dixon recoiled a pace, shivered, and began to
protest. But the other only laughed and reached
to his belt. On the motion, Dixon drew, and
sprang to meet him, shouting defiance.
From the security of his entrenchment Nissen
eyed the combat with dull comprehension of its
tragic features, but with a certain relish, never-
theless. The consciousness that he held in his
hand power to decide the issue at will set him
chuckling gleefully.
Suddenly he saw the contending men stagger
and fall, Westbrook beneath. He screamed once
like a wounded horse, and simultaneously his
revolver went up, hurriedly drew a line on Dixon,
and barked.
For just one hour Dixon thought he had
killed Captain Westbrook. Panting with
rage and exertion, blood roaring in his ears, he
had not noticed the pistol explosion. What he
knew was that the squirming form beneath him
suddenly relaxed and lay still. Knife in hand, he
jumped to his feet, looked, then turned, and ran
like the murderer he thought he was.
For minutes afterwards, Nissen watched the
sea with intense eyes and quivering underlip.
Then he scrambled down the slope—mechanically,
like a man who does one thing and thinks of
another. There was no shake in his hands as he
lifted the man his well-meant but luckless shot
had slain. He bore him to a projecting ledge,
and dropped him into deep water. Then he
returned and—as far as possible—destroyed all
traces of the tragedy. All this with a stolid, pre-
occupied air, as if his dwarfed wits had met a
problem. And they had. He felt he had some-
thing else to do—but what was it ?
Nissen could not think.
• •* * *
It was an hour later that Captain Dixon
emerged, with whisky-steadied nerves, from the
saloon. The criminal does sometimes re-visit
the scene of the crime—but it was no “mysterious
attraction ” that took Captain Dixon there. He
went, on an afterthought, through the gathering
dusk, to recover his forgotten revolver, which
might have told a tale—and to throw something
to the sharks. Nissen, still hunting the phantom-
answer to his question, saw him, and the answer
materialised. He crouched behind a rock, and
waited.
Dixon, half-drunk and swayed by one idea,
saw nothing, not even the sought revolver—which,
seeing that Nissen clutched it, is not surprising.
With the aimlessness of a bewildered man he
staggered out on the projecting ledge, and the
movement called Nissen to action. He had some-
thing to do ! He stepped stealthily after. Sud-
denly his hand went up, and the Neptune’s
skipper went out in a spirt of red flame and a
splash in the sea.
“ THE HOLY TRUTH.”
BENEVOLENT OLD LADY: “Now, if I give you a
shilling will you promise me not to waste any
of it?”
HOPELESS BILL: “ Yes, lady; not a drop.”
And, with the act, the dregs of Nissen’s reason
ran quite out, and he turned towards the settle-
ment trolling a coarse sea-song. The secret was
safe with him —for he had already forgotten it!

for near two days ; next to mad I was. Went up to
the door of one of them semi-detached villas they has in
the suburbs, an’ made the usual pitch to the missus. She
gets me into the kitchen an’ gives me a feed. Well, I had
to stow it away, tho’ I wasn’t a bit hungry—l’d just had
a good breakfast in the Mission, you see—but I had to, or
she’d think me a himposter. Then I starts the ole tale o’
sick wife an’ kids. She listens indifferent like, you know,
and then says, if I’d go to the cemetery an’ black-enamel
the names on a tombstone that she’d tell me the lay of,
why then, if it was done proper, I was to get ’arf-a-
crown. I told her I was that handy that I could
make a noo tombstone, if she wanted it. She
give me two bob to buy the enamel, so I has three
beers at a pub not too close. Then a couple of browns,
or so, gets me a little lamp-black and another copper
some oil to mix with it. I picks up a bit of bath-brick
too, to scrape down the blessed old tombstone with, and
of course I ’ad my quart billy o’ water too. First I

By the Way.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Isaac Lang, manager of the lease and belong-
ings of the Deep Coal Mining Company, Gipps-
land, was trudging from the nearest township out
to his people’s property, a narrow seam of unser-
viceable material at the end of a small tunnel at
the bottom of a gorge. The day was still young,
but the morning sun was hot and the way dreary
and wearisome. The cart-track writhed
along in a slow, despairing fashion, strangely sug-
gestive of dawdling bullock-team.s and indifferent
drivers; winding about fallen logs and sleeping
AN ABUSE OF CONFIDENCE.
CANNIBAL CHIEF: “ Thou crawling hypocrite! Sec what I found in
the pocket of the old cat thou gavest me this morning ! This
half-finished bottle tells its own tale of abject deceit. But,
ha ! think not to foil me thus. I’LL FATTEN THOU YET!"
oiumps, between tall, ragged white-gums and
occasional stunted cherry-trees. On the right an
interminable fence with a decided lurch to the
north ran out and on and on into eternity ; on the
left a fence without beginning or end, and with an
eager list to the south, raced back to infinity ; and,
right and left, before and behind, were baked grass
and gaunt, gesticulating trees with torn beards
and up-thrown hands, like chaffering Hebrews.
So far Lang had discovered only one break in
the monotony, but was grateful for that—the
weather-beaten fragments of a theatrical streamer
hanging from a smooth dead butt, advertising the
superlative merits of certain unknown artists in
song and dance, a strange and impertinent note in
an empty land.
Lang turned from the road at a familiar point,
and, facing a spur of the range to the left, cursed
in his heart the prospect of the climb in store, and
struck across country. After walking for half-an-
hour he came upon a lone slab-house built at a
little distance back from another track running at
right angles with the “main road.” He had
trudged the distance twice before, and had
noticed the house with passing wonder; amazed
that any sane man or woman could find motive for
remaining in that dismal, aching solitude, with the
whole wide busy world around them to choose
from. How the occupants lived, and, above all,
why, were problems that had engaged his atten-
tion temporarily ; but to-day he turned from his
straight course, and approached the house, at-
tracted by the sounds of loudly-disputing voices
and the clamor of dogs.
At the slip-panels two patient horses were
standing ready saddled. Before the door, in the
pits dug by burrowing pigs and the dust raked up
by many hens, two men hugging each other in
desperate grip were rolling and rioting. Around
these circled two large cattle-dogs, barking
amazedly, and half-a-dozen small mongrels made
sudden incursions and quick retreats, snapping at
the combatants, and yelping without cessation.
J ust as Lang seated himself comfortably, the cattle-
dogs clashed in their gyrations, and fastening,
fought tremendously over the bodies of their mas-
ters. A very tall thin old man and an exceedingly
stout, short old woman moved excitedly on the
outskirts of battle, protesting shrilly, much dis-
tressed, and a young woman leaned composedly
against the shoulder of a horse at a little distance,
apparently awaiting the issue of the conflict with
bland indifference.
The old man discovered Lang, and ran a few
steps towards him, beckoning excitedly.
“ Hi, hi, mister, mister !” he called.
The manager slipped from his rail, and, thrusting
his hands in his pockets, walked towards the house
in a leisurely manner that asserted his strict
neutrality. He stood for a moment looking down
at the combatants.
“ What’s the row?” he said.
“ Stop ’em ! Stop ’em ! ” ci-ied the long thin old
man fiercely.
“ Oh ! please do stop ’em,” wailed the thick old
woman.
Isaac regarded the fight dubiously.
“ It’s no business of mine, an’ it isn’t for me to
interfere rightly,” he said, “but ”
He seized the topmost combatant, and dragged
the men to their feet ; then with a pair of brawny
arms he pulled them apart, and held them.
“ Here, here ! no more silly business,” he said.
“ What’s all this about ? ”
The enemies were young men, under 25, one
very dark, the other fair, but both reduced to a
common complexion by the dust they had wal-
lowed in. They glared at each other, gasping for
breath.
“That swine wants to get away with my
girl! ” panted one.
“ It’s a lie —she’s mine ! ’’
blurted His rival.
Then they broke from
Lang, and rushed together
again, gripped and went
down, and raged in the
dust once more. Mean-
while the two big dogs
were fighting at large, and
monopolising the attentions
of all the little dogs; the
old couple were wringing
their hands in terror, splut-
tering and weakly protest-
ing; the girl remained
propped against her horse,
waiting patiently for a de-
finite settlement, and ap-
parently quite without
prejudice.
Isaac Lang took a fresh
hold, parted the enemies,
and stood between them, a
hand on the shirt-collar of
each.
“ Aleck, do behave ! ”
whined the old woman.
“ Y’ orter know better.”
“ Think I’m goin’ to let
him do me*out of my girl! ”
snorted Aleck, indignantly.
“She promised me, ye
thief!”
There was a struggle, but
it was only momentary ;
the big man twisted his
grip at the throat of each,
and they were still.
“It appears t’ me the
young lady can settle this,”
said Lang, suggestively.
“Linda!” squealed the
old woman.
Linda stirred awkwardly.
“ I dunno,” she said.
Linda was not beautiful.
Her hair was the color of
the baked grass; her face
was amazingly freckled, and
she had shocking feet, the
toes of which met inquisitively. She remained
passive.
“But I s’pose you’re the party referred to?”
said the astonished mediator.
“ Yes, she sez to me, on’y lars Sunday week ”
“ But she promised me long before that! ”
“Shut up ! ” Lang put the screw on again.
“Y’orter be ashamed, Jim Massen,” wailed
the agitated mother, in fretful terror.
“Don’t you want either of ’em, Miss?’’asked
Lang, with the air of a man who was determined
to see the matter through.
“ Linda! ” cried the old woman.
The girl blinked.
“I dunno—l s’pose so.”
“Which, then?”
“ I dunno. Which’d you say ? ”
“Oh, it’s nothin’ to do with me, Miss.”
Puzzled by this unpromising
situation, and feeling the folly
of intervening in so very in-
definite a dispute, Lang
liberated his prisoners,
and a wild and whirl-
ing disputation en-
sued, in which Jim
and Aleck and the
old couple engaged
with all their
energy. It only
lasted a minute or so,
as the rivals presently
fell to blows again,
toppled over locked
in a frenzied grip,
and recommenc-
ed the insane
attack, plung-
ed in the
dust, to the
renewed dis-
may of Linda’s
parents, who evident-
ly looked for a fatal
termination.
“ Mister ! Mister ! ”
piped the miserable
old man.
“Look here,” said
Isaac philosophically,
“ you let ’em be for a
while. They can’t hurt
each other much, an’
it’ll do ’em all sorts of
good.”
The old man seemed
relieved.
“I don’t want no
one killed on my laud,” he said.
“There won’t be any killin’, take my word,”
said Lang soothingly.
The dogs were a quarter of a mile off by tins
time, still fighting, and for ten minutes Lang and
Linda’s parents overlooked the battle in the dust;
the latter reassured and comparatively calm. And
now the manager heard the story of Linda’s loves.
11 Linda alwa’s was an undecided
so-to-speak sort o’ girl,” said the
old man. “She never knows what
she wants, an’ when she gets what
she thinks she wants, well, it turns
out ’taint what she wants after all.
You know what young girls is.”
Linda, who was 24, had, it
seemed, engaged herself to Aleck
in a moment of mental aberration,
and had promised to marry him on
that day and date. This was quite
satisfactory, but unfortunately Jim
had ridden up at the same time as
Aleck, and he reminded the young
lady that she had a previous
appointment with him for a mar-
riage, date unfixed. Trouble en-
sued. The girl was quite reason-
able according to her lights, and
declared that she would marry
either as soon as they would decide
which.
Isaac Lang began to be delighted
with the situation. It appealed to
his sense of humor, and he sud-
denly conceived an ambition to
clear up the difficulty. The com-
batants were very weary by this
time ; their enthusiasm had waned,
and they were content to cling to
each other, breathing profanity and
abuse. Lang took them in hand
for the third time, and divided
them. He made a mark for Aleck,
and set him on it. Ten paces off
he made a mark for Jim. He
planted himself between them,
armed with a hoe.
“Now,” he said, with decision,
“ I’ll knock the seven senses out of
the first man that moves, an’ then
the other can marry the girl before
he coraes-to.”
Linda was still awaiting the
issue; she leaned upon her horse
in a condition of apathetic reserve.
“ Look here, miss,” said the arbiter; “ you can’t
marry the pair of ’em, can you ? ”
Linda thought it over gravely.
“ ’Tisn’t religious,” she hinted.
“’Tisn’t legal,” said Isaac. “Well, why not
pick one, an’ be done with it ? ”
The girl looked from one to the other, and shook
her head drearily.
“ She promised me first! ” blurted Jim.
“Silence!” Lang commanded, brandishing his
hoe. “ She promised to marry you first,” he con-
tinued, in a judicial tone, “ an’ p’raps it’s fair she
should do it, an’ leave Aleck to take his chances ;
but, seein’ it’s the rule for a woman to marry the
man she promised last, Aleck seems to have first
claim. So it only remains for the two of you to
toss for it, allowin’ that the young woman’s agree-
able.”
“ Linda ! ” squealed the mother.
“Are you agreeable to tossin’ for it, miss ?”
Linda was quite agreeable to anything, and so
Isaac produced a penny.
“I toss—you cry,” he said to Aleck. “Now,
sudden death ! ”
“ Head ! ” cried Aleck.
It was Tail.
“ She’s yours,” said the peacemaker to Jim, and
the successful young man hurrah’d and capered
like a kid, while Aleck glowered upon him omin-
ously.
Now, for the first time, Linda developed a sort
of sullen interest. She demurred.
“ I’m goin’ to marry Aleck,” she said.

A.D. 1998.
OFFICE R: “ Why was Private Maginnis absent
from parade to-day?”
CORPORAL : “ Confined in the guard-room, mum.”
OFFICER : "What for? Drunkenness?”
CORPORAL : " No, mum—triplets!"
A CITY SIMILE.
COUNTRY KID : “ That’s the best cow
we’ve got.”
CITY KID : “ Why don’t you get his handlebars
straightened?”
This was unreasonable, perhaps, but decisive.
Jim objected, and prepared to give battle again.
“ That settles it,” said Lang. The lady’s deci-
sion is final. Your match is off, James.”
Jim rushed his rival, but Isaac intervened, and
presently had the rejected suitor down, and was
sitting on him.
“ Better get along to your weddin’,” he said to
Aleck. “ I’ll give you half-an-hour’s start.”
Aleck helped Linda into her saddle, and three
minutes later the couple were cantering briskly
down the track, whilst Jim writhed desperately,
and cursed with all his heart and soul under his
heavy and powerful captor. Isaac held Jim for
the full half-hour, during which time Linda’s
parents regaled him with strong tea and corned-
beef sandwiches. When Jim was liberated he
made a dart for his horse, and threw himself into
the saddle. Rushing the nag through the top rail
of the opposite fence, he went at breakneck pace
across the paddocks in pursuit of Linda.
* * * *
Isaac Lang did not pass that way again for
nearly seven weeks, and when he did he met
Linda’s long, thin parent driving a very attenu-
ated cow and a wobbling calf. The old man
recognised him, after peering closely into his face
for half-a-minute.
“ Oh, the weddin’ ?” he said. “Yes, yes. That
Jim, he caught up to ’em afore they reached the
parson’s place, an’ Linda, bein’ a undecided-
sort of girl, thought maybe she’d best marry him
after all—an’ she did.”
“Well, I’m hanged ! An’ Aleck—what’s come
of him ? ”
“Aleck? Oh, he’s all right; ’im an’ Linda
ran off together las’ Toosday week.”

Re fearsome experiences. Present
writer’s brother went out badger-hunting once on
Tas. West Coast with the commander of a stranded
timber-barge and a new-cbum. The captain bore
the shovel and supplied the loose language, whilst
the chum supported a deadly old shotgun tied up
with bootlaces. Writer’s brother did the badger-
tracking and offered up prayers. Towards even-
ing they got fogged, and the skipper shinned up a
gum to take observations. He was an enormously
bulky person, and the tree was slippery, so he
called upon the chum to give him a shove behind.
Just about here, writer’s brother, who was calmly
watching the antics of the sailor, observed his
hair begin to rise and his bulging eyeballs fix
themselves in horror. The chum was assisting
the speechless mariner’s ascent with the muzzle
of the gun—and the hammer at full-cock ! When
the perspiring tar reached the ground he hunted
the chum to the coast with the shovel, leaving a
trail of blasted timber in their wake. In calmer
moments he said he would have had one consola-
tion had the chum drilled a hole through him—in
flattening the miscreant out in his fall and strang-
ling him in his death-grip.
“San Remo": A farm-hand at Kabra,
Central Q., when passing one night through some
tall grass, felt a snake twine itself round his leg,
inside his trousers, and climb upwards. He bent
down, and made a wild grab at where he thought
its head was, and, with “the luck of a Chow,”
seized the head, with a handful of trouser. About
10 o’clock that night there came to the Gracemere
Hotel a scared-looking individual, bent double,
and clutching one leg of his trousers with a death-
grip. The apparition nodded its head wildly,
muttering “ Snake ! snake ! ” and we all gathered
round to investigate. The wriggling tail showing
above the boot explained the situation, and Gum-
sucker Bill at once took command. “ Sit down,
mate,” said he —and called for a drink, which the
stranger eagerly swallowed. Stretching out the
man’s leg, Bill caught the snake by the tail.
“ Now,” said he, “ when 1 call ‘ go ! ’ let her go ' ”
But he of the snake wouldn’t chance that. “I
don’t let up on this ’ere snake while I can dror a
breath,” he said. Then, after scratching his head
a bit and cursing a lot, Bill took his knife and cut
off the snake’s head and a piece of the pants ; but,
even then, whether from terror or cramp, the
stranger could not relax his grip. Bill had to
force open his fist with the handle of his knife, and
the snake’s head fell snapping on the floor.


An Awful Night.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mb. Joshua Lilly had been detained in the city
by what he called a fortuitous concourse of events,
and long after midnight he started on foot for his
home in a distant suburb, hoping to be overtaken
on the way by a belated cab. No cab came in the
course of the first mile, and Mr. Joshua Lilly was
tempted by considerations of Mrs. Joshua —a large
woman who always sought explanations and never
accepted them —to take a short cut across Jamtin
Flat, a level sweep of land reclaimed out of a
swamp. The rain came, and hapless Mr. Lilly,
scurrying like a wet hen, was washed across the
railway line into Quob’s Corner.
Quob’s Corner is a tangled section of a poor
suburb, hopelessly cut off from respectability, and
given over to impoverished drunkards and mean,
ambitionless criminals. Joshua Lilly, the very
acme of respectability when dry and with his
linen in good order, knew nothing of the reputa-
tion of Quob’s Corner, but its dark, desolate
streets chilled him, and something like terror
chased him though the pelting rain.
He was one of those thin, sleek, twittering
little men who contrive to support a dignity in
fair weather and under favorable circumstances,
but his claim upon popular respect was due almost
entirely to starch. Starch was his moral back-
Washed into Quob's corner.
bone, and with a limp shirt and a sodden collar he
was a pulpy, characterless mute, washing about
in the darkness of Quob’s Corner, and most
devoutly he wished himself at home.
Suddenly, hastening along, head down, boring
his way through the rain, Joshua collided smartly
with some tremendous mass which seemed to open
and envelop him. For a few moments he swayed
about helplessly, moved by the mighty bulk, and
then he got his head free, and discovered to his
great joy that he was in the hands of the police.
“It’s all right, officer ! ” he gasped ; “I’m just
on my way home.”
He was clasped tighter, tucked under the
abundant arm of the law, and the officer swayed
above him like a willow wand stirred by a gale.
Presently, the myrmidon began to drift to leeward;
then he brought up with a jerk, and went over to
windward, righted again, and stood oscillating
from his base with the movements of a nautch-
dancer, and Lilly drifted or danced with him,
feeling strangely like a ladybird tackling a
mastodon.
“Really, constable—most respectable man,”
protested Mr. Lilly; “name of Joshua Lilly.
Kept late—fortuitous events, you know.”
But his custodian was off again, driving wildly up
the street this time, with a dangerous list to port
and the strange aimlessness of a strip of paper
careering in the wind. He ran aground against a
brick building, on which he leaned to recover his
breath, still clinging desperately to Joshua, who
had lost his hat in the flight and had been
towed in the mud for half the distance.
“Come, I say, Mr. Policeman,” protested Lilly,
with pitiful indignation, “ this is too bad, sir—too
bad altogether ! ”
The officer of the law was quite oblivious; he
clung to Joshua automatically, as he might have
clung to any trifling article he had picked up in
passing, and gazed far off into the night with dim,
unseeing eyes, and began to sing, beating time
vaguely with his free hand :
“ She’s the mosh dishtreshful counthry that ever yit was
seen ;
They are hangin’ min an’ winimin for the wearin’ av the
green.”
The policeman propped himself at a more com-
fortable angle with his back to the building, and
the rain sluiced down, and ran in miniature falls
off his waterproof. A convenient street-lamp
illumined his gigantic proportions with a sickly
glimmer, but up and down the street ranged the
black, silent houses, and not another living soul
could Lilly see anywhere. A town clock struck
two. Joshua was wet, dirty, and filled with
misery; he recognised the awful truth, and his
heart sank within him like a thing of lead. The
law was drunk —fatuously, fantastically drunk.
He thought of Mrs. Lilly again, and revolted
weakly.
“Let me go, policeman. This is an outrage.
If you don’t let me go I shall most certainly report
you.”
“ O, the French are on the say,
Siz the shan van vocht
The French are on the say,
Siz the shan van vocht ; ”
sang the oblivious policeman. But this time he
"She’s the mosh distressh[?] country."
“ Fwhere the divil did I git it?"
endeavored to beat time with his left hand, and
Joshua was in that hand. The resistance irritated
the officer ; he made another effort and brought his
captive into view, and held him suspended for a
moment, blinking at him in stupid curiosity. For
the first time he was conscious that he possessed
Joshua.
“I insist that you release me at once,” gasped
Joshua—“ at once, sir, do you hear? ”
The constable did not hear. He was thinking,
thinking, thinking, gazing amazedly at his prize
the while.
“ Fwhere the divil did I get id ? ” he murmured
in troubled accents.
“I ran into your arms,” protested Joshua.
“An accident—quite an accident! ”
The policeman continued his wondering self-
catechisation.
“ Fwhin did I arrist id, an’ whoi ? ”
“I am not arrested,” cried Lilly. “ Eh—eh,
constable, would—eh—half -a-crown ? ” He held
up the shining coin.
The policeman’s eyes centred on the half-crown
for a moment, then he took it mechanically, and,
as a matter of habit, dropped it into his pocket.
“Look here, me mahn,” he said; “how long
have ye bin undther arrist, an’ who the divil are
ye, anyhow ? ”
Lilly opened up in explanation, but his captor
had suddenly forgotten him, and had drifted into
boozy song again.
“There’s a dear little plant that growsh in our Oile,
’Twas Sint Pathrick himself sure that sit id
See here (hie), it’sh no kind av use ye prevari-
cathin’. I’ll get ye six munths fer dthis, phwat-
iver it ish,” said he, becoming unexpectedly con-
scious of Lilly again, and shaking an impressive
forefinger at that worried citizen.
Lilly denied everything, and struggled with
the inveterate hand that held him. It was as if a
mosquito wrestled with a smoke-stack.
“ I misrewmember fwhat ’twash ye did an’ whin
ye did id, but I’m sartin ye’re the guilty man, so
come aisy an’ decent, or I’ll bate ye sick an’ sore.”
Lilly fought with the energy of despair, but
they were off again, lurching through the floods of
rain, battling through the slush, and Hooley led
his prisoner as a thoughtless small boy leads a toy
terrier, unconscious of his weight and careless of
his bones. Once or twice Joshua cried for help,
but his breath was gone from him, and nothing
short of the murder of a policeman would draw
“ Ye’ve been a great throuble to me."
Quob’s Corner bodily from its bed. Up and down
shabby streets, and in and out of dirty lanes, the
tremendous man hauled his new find, at first with
a dim idea of finding the watchhouse, but later
with no purpose in the world. He ran into a tree-
guard at last, and, seeing no way through, stayed
there, and sang a wild Fenian song at the top of
his voice. In the middle of the third verse he dis-
covered Joshua once more, and with almost as
much surprise as on the former occasion.
“Here ye are again,” he said in troubled
accents.
“Help! Help! Help!” cried the wretched
captive at the top of his small, thin voice.
“Ye’ve bin a great throuble t’me, ye have,”
continued Hooley, reproachfully.
Joshua repeated his shrill appeal, and Hooley
drew his baton and struck out in an indefinite, dis-
passionate sort of way, raising a sudden bump on
the little man’s head and driving him into terrified
silence.
“I do be rigrittin’ me kindness to ye,” said
Hooley. “ It’s ivident ye’re a bad malm—l must
take precahtions.”
He produced his handcuffs, snapped one ring
on his left wrist, and the other on Lilly’s right.
“Now, we’ll sarch fer the body,” he said,
brightly. “Ye’ll take me straight t’ the mur-
thered mahn. It’s great honor I’ll have out av
thish noight’s wor-r-k—honor an’ gloory an’ prifar-
mint.”
He took flight with the wind, and Lilly went
with him. In spite of his fat, Hooley had marvel-
lous endurance, and after doing three laps round
the square he was so little distressed by his frantic
spin and the burden of Lilly that he fetched-up
in the middle of the road with his back to the
storm, and sang a song in a roaring baritone.
Somebody in the second storey of a squalid resi-
dence hard by threw up a window and hurled
curses and crockery, also some knobs off an
iron bedstead. Lilly seized his opportunity.
“ Help ! Help ! Oh, help ! ” lie moaned.
“Get home, ye silly old cow!” cried a voice
out of the darkness, and the window rattled down.
And still the warm rain marched over the be-
lated couple in succeeding battalions, rank after
rank,, and Hooley sang and Lilly moaned feebly,
id, in accents that might have touched a heart
f beaten brass, pleaded with the insensate
monster to whom he was riveted. The little man
had never been so utterly wretched in all his life.
He was soaked through and through ; his legs
were limp, and the very heart seemed washed out
of him. Half-a-dozen times he had been rolled in
the mud, and half-a-dozen times the rain had
sluiced him clean again. He was a mere atom on
the end of Hooley’s tether, and was whisked
hither and thither with as much thought as a
mastiff gives to the wagging of his tail.
Square in the middle of the road, leaning upon
the wind, with the storm-waters sweeping from
the great sides of him, the constable sang the
woes of Ireland, and his turbulent song chorded
well with the roar of the elements ; but a momen-
tary cessation of the gale left Hooley at the mercy
of the law of gravitation, and he plunged bodily
into the mud, throwing Joshua far and wide.
There was a lull while Joshua lay on his back with
outspread limbs, winded and quite beaten, and the
policeman rested, blinking up through the rain,
deliberately collecting his faculties and weighing
the evidence.
When Lilly cared to recollect and to think of
precautions, he found Hooley crawling on his
knees, and clawing in the mud, and moaning in his
desolation.
_ “I’ve bin sthruck —sthruck bitter. Och ! saints
give him into me hand fwad done it. Are ye
there, ye dir-rty scut, ye ! Oh ! oh ! Ned Hooley,
ye’re by the way av’ bein’ killed. An’ me poor
mother —me poor owld mother ! Me head ! me
head—oh, me bad head ! Where are ye that hit
me ? Let me get the hand on ye, an’ I’ll tear ye
bone an’ body.”
He continued prospecting vaguely in the mud,
repeating the words “bone an’ body” as if the
phrase pleased him, and Lilly realised that it
would not be good to fall into the clutch of his
enemy whilst that mood was upon him, and crept
He was a mere atom at the end of Hooley's tether.
by his side very warily, careful not to bear upon
the bond that bound them. All in vain. After
they had been crawling for a minute or two
Hooley chanced a hand in the middle of Joshua’s
back, bearing the little man flat into the mud, and
then began an insane scramble on the roadside, in
which the captive was fumbled violently, but
without sustaining much hurt. Then Hooley lost
him in the dirt and confusion, and went creeping
straight ahead in quest of his enemy, muttering
softly of saints and manslaughter, and towing
Joshua behind him through the puddles.
The constable ran his head against a wall
after a five minutes’ search, gave the matter due
consideration, and then rolled over and sat in a
pool, and babbled of lovely woman. The clock
struck three.
Lilly curled under the lee of the Law and rested,
and gave thanks while Hooley’s scandalous solilo-
quy ran on, but an eloquent gesture drew the
captive over the knees of the captor, and the offi-
ce’' apprehended an insult.
* Sorr, ye’re inthrusive,” he said loftily. He
<jrew Joshua close to him, and peered at his face
in the darkness. “Was we intherjuced ?” he
asked.
At this point he discovered the connecting link,
and recollected deliberately and with great effort.
“ Yis, yis, yis,” he said, “ av coorse, I mind ye.
’Twas murther, an’ we was foindin’ the body.” He
changed his tone to one of fretful remonstrance.
“Ye’ve been a sore throuble t’me this blissid
noight—a wearin’ throuble. ’Twasn’t dacent av
ye t’ bate me, an’ me wid a fam’ly, an’ —an’ a big
sorra ! ”
Joshua ventured a word or two, pleading and
consolatory, but felt the baton chopping at him
and desisted.
“Ye’ve give me the ondacent long chase for ye
—an ondacent long chase for a man o’ my time an’
wid a big sorra.”
Joshua knew that the Law was weeping, but
wisely refrained from comment.
“I take it onkind of ye. An’ ye assaulted me
in the execution av me juty. I mind ye dish-
throyed me uniform beyant in the mud. ’Twas
onchristyin. I’m a weary man an’ a man wid a
great sorra, an’ ye’ve chased me troo the mud, an’
ye’ve murth’rously assaulted me, an’ ye’ve done
murther this night. Me wid the bitter grief on
me ! I was thrue to her, I tell ye. I’m disaved
an’ malthrated.” Hooley wept maudlin tears and
talked of many varied tribulations, sitting up in
his pool the while, and Joshua never ventured an
answer.
“ She’s discar-rded me for that hay then Porty-
gee from Belgium—me that was thrue an’ lovin’
to her —thrue to her for sivin weeks, barrin’ the
woife, who don’t count. Och ! och ! me hear-rt’s
breakin’ —breakin’ it is ! Oh, the cruel wor-rld 1
Disarted me, a dacent married Christian, for a
Portygee haythen from Belgium! ”
Mr. Hooley’s grief quite overcame him, and his
vast bulk was shaken with sobs. It was long ere
he regained control of his emotion, and then he

continued to maunder, speaking softly; pitiful
was the moan of the strong man in his agony.
Lilly had crept to the lee again, and there, shel-
tered by the vigilant officer, he lay close and silent.
Any cry or movement from him brought the baton
snapping automatically at his head, and the little
man had long since given up all hope of a rescue.
He was deeply grateful for this rest for his aching
and weary bones, and presently found himself
drifting into sleep. The clock struck 4, and the
rain still fell. The unhappy prisoner was awak-
ened by a violent wrench at his handcuff. Hooley
was saying in a low, passionless voice— .
“ Ilows’m’ever ye’ve done murther this noight,
an’ murther’s a misdimanor an’ a offince undther
the Act. We’ll sarch fer the body, an’ ’tis a sar-
jint I’ll be in the mornin’.”
The constable climbed to his feet with some
difficulty, and jerked Lilly up after him ; then he
balanced himself and reflected.
“Ye bate me ! ” he said, trembling again on the
verge of tears, “an’ ye’ve wore the sowl out av
me wid the owdacious tratemint, but in the name
av hivin get me a dhrink, an’ I’ll forgive ye ivery-
thin’ —iverythin’, moind.”
Hooley indulged in another erratic flight around
the block, crying aloud for strong drinks, and then
he dragged Joshua into a black, evil-smelling lane,
and presently found a snug retreat for himself
amongst a wheelwright’s lumber, where there were
dry shavings in a long, narrow case that had once
contained corrugated iron. The policeman made
his bed in the box and lay there indulging in
occasional bursts of song, but for the most of the
time bewailing his misfortunes and the faithless-
ness of woman, leaving his prisoner out in the
mud and the rain. Joshua was careless now if he
lived or died, and half convinced that he was dead
and had gone to hell, condemned to be dragged
through an endless night of rain and dirt by this
gibbering fiend that knew not manners nor ruth.
After a while Hooley’s chummerings had a
soporific effect on Joshua, who would have slept
again, but Hooley tugged him back into a full
consciousness of his misery.
‘‘Are ye there, ye wicked mahn V’ moaned the
policemen. “ There’sh blood on veer hands, an’
ye have a bad hear-rt; but I’m alone an’ tore wid
me sorra. Sing to me, Charley.”
The request was made in the voice of a tired
child, but, as there was no response, a jerk of the
chain brought Lilly smartly to attention.
“ Sing to me ! ” demanded the Law.
“I do not sing, policeman ; I have no voice. I
beg your pardon, but—but—”
Hooley struck out from his box with the baton
“ Soothe me wid song,” he said.
His waiting spouse.
Lilly began to sing in a husky treble. For the
life of him he could think of nothing but “Hey
diddle-diddle, the cat and the fiddle, the cow-
jumped over the moon,” and he sang that three or
four times over.
“ ! Tis a dthrunken low song, Charley, mf ye
have no lamin’ in music, but ye may sing. Ye
can’t rifuse it to a dyin’ mahn, Charley, dear—dyin’
in nade av a dhrop av dhrink. Sing to me.”
Kneeling in the outer darkness and dampness,
Joshua crooned his ridiculous song over the moun-
tain of gross flesh spread out upon the shavings,
and all the time Hooley hiccuped weakly of
woman and drink and his besetting sorrow. Com-
ing day softened the darkness into greyness, and
Lilly sang on. The babbling of Hooley grew
fitful and drowsy; sleep was pressing hard upon
him, and Joshua, bowed above him, dreamed of
escaping before the coming of the sun. He recol-
lected another song, and changed his tune to
“ Hush-a-bye, baby, on the tree-top,” and no
mother lisping over her restless babe ever threw
such depths of precious feeling, such soothing
fervor, into the simple old cradle ditty.
The policeman slept, and Lilly sang on till
Hooley’s snore had deepened and broadened into
an emphatic assurance of sound slumber, and then
he allowed his song to die gradually, and com-
menced a cautious, but eager, hunt in the police-
man’s clothes for the key of the handcuffs. In
those few moments Joshua developed all the in-
sidious faculties of a gifted pickpocket; he was as
insinuating as a serpent, as soft as a dove.
He discovered the key at length. In his haste
and anxiety he unlocked the cuff from Hooley’s
wrist, and in a few seconds the sorely-tried and
long-suffering citizen was speeding towards his
home in the dim light of the new-born day.
On reaching the street in which he lived, Lilly
noticed, for the first time, that the handcuffs
dangled from his wrist. He had left the key with
Hooley. Hatless and ghastly pale; tattered,
breathless, muddy, handcuffed, and sopping wet,
Mr. Joshua tottered into the shelter of his own
home and the arms of his waiting spouse. What
happened thereafter is another story.
SILAS SNELL.


Men Are Such Fools.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(Time: Night. Place: A snug sitting-room.
Persons : A big man, a small slender woman, and
a three-months’ infant. Man wears evening dress,
lounges on a sofa and looks at woman with
measureless content. Woman wears silken tea-
gown and pile of shining hair, and divides her
attention between infant and “Ordeal of Richard
Feverel.” Infant is asleep in a decorated cradle
and covered with a white silk coverlet, em-
broidered at four corners with his name, “ Leo.”
Woman yawns.)
Man: “You are absolutely the only woman
I’ve ever met who can yawn gracefully, Leonora.”
Woman : “My teeth are so good, and—the book
so dull. I suppose ‘ Ziska ’ was ‘ out.’ All the
good books are always ‘ out.’ ”
Man (after purring a space): “By the way, I
see that Vincent Calvert’s book is ad ”
Woman (rising with little scream and running
to letter-rack on mantel-piece): “I knew I had
something to show you ; I’ve been trying to think
what it was all the evening. No, it’s not in the
rack. Where can I have put it?” (Searches
desk, table-drawers, peers behind clock.)
Man : “What is it, dearest ? ”
Woman: “Poetry—Vincent Calvert’s. I got
it this morning. It’s to our Leo, and ” (Looks
in coal-scuttle.)
Man (becoming suddenly grave): “ Surely, Leo-
nora, you wouldn’t put anything Calvert wrote
into a coal-scuttle ! ”
Woman : “It wasn’t a book, silly. It was just
on a few sheets of notepaper like the other things
he sends.” (Man chuckles delightedly at the fas-
cinating lack of humour.) “Oh, here it is.”
(Draws paper out of a vase and gives it to man.)
Man : “ ‘To the March Baby’—that’s a pretty
title.” (Reads verses intently, then looks up sud-
denly.) “ These are very fine, dear.”
Woman : “ Fine ? not a line rhymes ! I couldn’t
finish reading it.”
Man (after re-reading): “Very fine indeed.
You will have quite a collection of Calvert’s verses
in time.”
Woman: “I have now.” (Checks them on her
fingers.) “ There’s the set he sent on our wedding-
day, and what came on the anniversary of our
wedding, and now this lot to our baby, besides
what comes on the fifth of September.”
Man: “What occurred on the fifth of Sep-
tember?”
Woman: “He says that’s the day I refused
him. He has an astonishing memory. Why, I
don’t remember the date you proposed, and good-
ness knows I was and is—no, am, dreadfully in
love.” (An interlude of three minutes.) “Then
there’s another, commemorating some stupid walk
we took together.”
Man : “ Would anyone believe that I was
accepted where Vin. Calvert was rejected !
Frankly, dear, I’m more amazed at his infatua-
tion for you than at your rejection of him.”
Woman: “So would I be if I didn’t know the
real cause—those high-falutin letters.”
Man : “ That you wrote him ? ”
Woman : “That I wrote him to Edith Robbins
dictation.”
Man: “The Sphinx-like girl; why—”
Woman : “No, the Sphinx is only half a beast,
and Edith is a whole one. If you knew the way
she rounded on me for refusing Vincent —and all
the time she was dictating those letters she was
wild about him herself ! ”
Man : “ I meant her inscrutable face.”
Woman : “ She has very thick lips.”
Man: “So has the Sphinx. But go on,
dear.”
Woman: “Well, when Edith and I went to
Tasmania, Mr. Calvert was just a little in love
with me—if at all, and only wrote to me about
some people he knew calling on us, There was

really no reply needed, but Edith insisted, and as
she knows I can’t write anything but a schoolgirl
letter, she told me what to say. Such a letter!
You know Edith is a B.A. It was like the Bible
and Shakespeare, in spots, and full of music and
birds and thoughts, and it ended with something
from one of his own poems —something about ‘the
clucking soul surveying chaos ’ ”
Man (choking): “ Clucking Soul 1 O, Nora !
* Brooding,’ dear, ‘ the brooding soul.’ ”
Woman: “Brooding, hatching, and clucking
mean much the same thing. Well, I
nearly died laughing at that letter. And
the funny thing was Edith couldn’t write
a nice one for herself. Such curt, com-
monplace little notes she used to enclose
with mine.”
Man: “How did you find out that
she liked Calvert ? ”
Woman : “ Oh, several ways. The first
time I suspected it was when I remarked
that he slouched. She got red and angry,
and said that it was ‘the scholar’s
stoop.’ ”
Man : “ Yes, Mrs. Ward’s phrase.”
Woman: “Mrs. Ward has the discern-
ment of a sheep. Yesterday she asked me
where I got this sateen. Why, even our
baby knows that this tea-gown is silk pure
silk.”
Man : “ I mean Mrs. Humphrey Ward, who—”
Woman: “Don’t know her. Well, Mr.
Calvert replied with a letter that sounded
exactly like the one I had written him, only
finer. I wrote another to Edith’s dictation,
and he another, and Edith was in a great
state of joy and excitement, but I got -s
scared, and wouldn’t write any more. You
know the rest. He actually came over.
And he was frightfully in love with me as
he imagined me. My mind equalled my face
and grace and all the rest of it.”
Man: “You should have told him the facts.”
Woman : “ I wanted to, on the voyage back, but
Edith said she’d throw herself overboard if !
did.”
Man: “Did you try to live up to his delu-
sion?” . ..
Woman : “ For a few hours. It was like cycling
against a southerly buster. Fhen I got seasick
till we landed. Afterwards he put down what he
■thought was my changed
manner to caprice, and
wrote verses making out
there was no grace or
beauty without caprice.”
Man (sighing): “I
wish he were only half
as happy as I am. Why
doesn’t Miss Robbins
bring him down out of
that kangaroo - ground
where he has buried him-
self to grow pumpkins ? ”
Woman: “No, to for-
get me.”
Man: “Well, Miss
Robbins ought to help
him to forget, if not to
grow pumpkins. She
has no courage.”
Woman: “No cour-
age ! Why, she’ll go on
an all-day harbor - trip
without a veil, and still
keeps up her birthdays
though the next will
make her 30. Isn’t that
courage ? ”
Man ; “ Men have got
the Victoria Cross for
less ! ”
Woman: “Edith’s
only chance would be
to convince him that he’s
in love with a mistaken
identity.”
Infant (s cre a m in g
; loudly): “Quaw-waw-
| waw-a-a.” (Father and
mother run to it, feel its
pulse and feet, peer into
its face and jerk out
observations about croup
and convulsions. Enter
elderly nurse.)
Nurse : “If you’ll ex,
cuse me, ma’am, it’s after nine, and
if you mean to upset that child
by keepin’ it out of its cot in a
room full of light, and mixin’ up its
meal-times, I’d rather someone else
had the responsibility of ”
Woman (hurriedly): “I’ll carry
him upstairs, nurse.”
Man: “No, let me.”
Woman : “ You’re too big and
awkward. You hold him as if he
were a football or a bear cub.”
Man : “ Well, I’ll carry you and
him.” (Does so. Nurse follows,
smiling sourly).
Part 11.
(Seven years later. Time: night.
Place: shabby sitting-room. Woman
is standing at table cutting, with
infinite diplomacy, the second little
pair of knickerbockers out of a
worn overcoat. Her dress is in
keeping with the tarnished room,
her hair coiled in a hard lump on
the nape of her neck, her face
puckered and full of concern for the
narrow things of the house. Be-
tween her lips is a stick of chalk.
There’s a racing and chasing all over the
house ; overhead a pillow-fight is in progress. An
infant’s scream is heard).
Woman (at top of her voice, but still gripping
chalk): “ Leo, what is the matter with your little
sister ? I’ll give the whole five of you such a
whipping in a minute.”

Man (Thinner and somewhat seedy-looking.
Throwing himself on to sofa and glancing discon-
tentedly at wife): “My dear, why do you make a
chalk-pit of your mouth ?”
(Youthful maid-of-all-work, entering excitedly):

Exit, hurriedly, mistress and maid. Fearsome
sounds of a general engagement are heard.
Man (after listening wearily): “Nora has no
organising talents. A woman with small means
and large family should have a certain ingenuity—
a sleight-of-head, as it were. She can’t think
above or see beyond—beyond—little knickers.”

I could win a sweep or invent something—even a
new polish for tan boots. Wish I were a bunyip

(His eyes dilate and fill with horror. Goes over
and examines pieces of overcoat. Groans “My
God ! ” and subsides on a chair, displacing a copy
of the Ladies’ Qualm magazine and another of the
Bugle-Horn, a musical review. Opens first,
mechanically and still groaning, at verses entitled,
“ Lines to the March Baby.” Sounds of battle
recede, and the voice of the conqueror is heard.)
Man (as his wife comes in): “ Nora, what is the
meaning of this?” (indicating remains of over-
coat).
Woman (pinning lcnicker-leg to coat-sleeve):
“ It was very shabby.”
Man : “ Shabby ! It would have done me for
another three years. I can’t afford a new one,
and the winter’s coming.” (Groans some more.)
Woman (handing him parcel): “ There’s a new
overcoat. I’m earning something now. I’ve
made eight guineas, and I’m saving up for a tailor-
made for myself.”
Man (looking in amazement from new overcoat
to his wife) : “Eh ? ”
Woman (with some satire): “ I’ve turned maga-
zine contributor. Why, you were looking at my
contribution just now ; * Lines to the March
Baby.’ In the Bugle-Horn you’ll find ‘ Septem-
ber the Fifth,’— one of them. Six other papers
have got six other September the Fifths.”
Man (falteringly) : “Are you publishing Yin
Calvert’s verses ? Are you capable of such —such —
anything so infamous?”
Woman (calmly, snipping at old overcoat) :
“ Don’t creak your chair like that! lam publish-
ing my property. And I didn’t put any name to
them. The editors say they are lovely poems. I
get a guinea each for them, and for that one about
pur wedding-day the Bugle-1 lorn man gave me
two. I was just sick to make some money when I
thought of this plan.” # ~

Woman : “He won’t discover. I know he
never reads anything like those magazines.
Man (excitedly) : “Rubbish! He’ll know in a

Woman (tapping scissors against thimble and
looking pensive) : “ Then of course I can’t have
my coat silk-lined. Sateen will have to do.
(Sighs deeply.)
Man (his jaw dropping): “Eh ?”
Woman : “ They charge thirty shillings extra
for silk-lining. I have seven poems left—that’s
seven guineas, but a dancing-class frock for little
Blanche is to come out of that—and next month’s
April, and there’s a sonnet due to the April Baby
—that’s Bobby. If Calvert doesn’t find out before
April I’ll be safe, and I’ll try to get ten shillings
extra for it.”
Man (with icy calm): “ But the man’s opinion
of you ? ”
Woman (smiling) : “ Well, if it changes, what a
blessing for Edith Robbins ! I’ll have done good
for myself and Edith and Vincent.”
Man (in soliloquy): “Yet I said she had no
sleight-of-head—no ingenuity ! ”
Part 111.
A room in a house in the Goulburn valley.
Shelves full of books, a bench covered with seeds.
Vincent Calvert reading a letter from Edith
Robbins: “And even at the risk of losing
your good opinion I cannot contain my indig-
nation longer. In some third-rate English and.
Australian publications I have of late read
several anonymous sets of verses, the merit of
which was so much above the average that
they immediately attracted attention from quarters
whence attention is most flattering. The
style was so like yours that if I did not know you
never published verse I should have unhesitatingly
fitted them to your name. This day I was in the
editor’s room at the Bugle Horn office (the maga-
zine in which one of the poems appeared) and the
editor, who is a great friend of mine, showed me
a ‘ beautiful sonnet,’ ‘ The April Baby,’ which had
just come in ; also the note accompanying the
poem. The handwriting of the sonnet was yours ,
my friend; the name signed to the note was Leonora
Clayton!” (Drops letter and thinks aloud, his
eyes ablaze with surprise and pleasure.) “Pub-
lished them! The darling girl! Yet sometimes
I thought she did not appreciate or quite under-
stand my rhymes. Published them! Aha-a-a !
you lout that she married, you can’t write verses
to her ! ... It was her delicate way of letting
me know how she appreciated my remembrance-
for, of course, she thought I should see them. As
for you, Miss Robbins, you spiteful creature, I have
written my last letter to you. I’m convinced that
you had something to do with losing my love
Leonora to me. I’m convinced that those were
your unnatural, stilted, brainy letters written from
Hobart. Published them ! Dear, you are an
inspiration—l’ll write you verses every week after
this —nay, I’ll write now. lam inspired.”

Dear Bulletin. —One day of my life on
the selection —yesterday. The rain held off, as it
has for the past nine months, and I turned out of
bunk at five in the morning, and struggled on
behind the plough, urging the weak horses along,
till noon. Twice a week Igo to the creek for my
load of thick, slimy water, each load costing half
a day. Last night I got back from the Gil Gil at
8 ; watered, and gave the horses a little feed, and
went into the hut to boil the billy. There was
nothing to cook—only a cold mutton-bone and
some bread and jam—so I lay on the bunk
till the water should boil, but the water sang
me to sleep. Didn’t dream—too tired to dream.
When I woke, the billy was a ruin, and it must
have been midnight. Trying to open my eyes, I
staggered outside, and —waded through water and
and mud. Rain at last ! My heart stopped. A
moment later it was explainable. The foal had
tampered with the tap with his teeth or nose, and
the tank was empty. So this morning a weary
man and weary horses went forth again to the
creek.—Yours, Simply Hallelujah.


His Brother Ike—A True Bill.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The stuffy, first-class compartment was filled with
sporting men, most of whom were studying their
race-books, or the latest tips in the morning
papers. A hard-faced, sinful-looking crowd, with
0:10 notable exception. He sat opposite me, next
the window—the prettiest young man I ever aw,
with a complexion any girl would have envied,
large frank blue eyes, and a sunny little moustache
carefully trimmed to give his teeth a show when
he smiled. His pearl-grey suit fitted him without
a wrinkle, showing to advantage the 12-stone
igure of an athlete in training. It was the
curious contrast between his boyish face, dainty
clothes and jewellery, and his brawny figure that
attracted my attention.
. ie s P°rtsman who sat on my left conveyed his
impression of the youth in a brief whisper-
“ Mug!” f
ti ln res Ponse to my inquiring look, he added—
Solly has him set. Just you watch how lie’ll
pal up to him for a little business.”
Solly was evidently the hook-nosed young-old
man who had seated himself beside his prey and
was now drawing his attention to something in
his race-book. A significant grin flitted round the
carriage, and several eyes were furtively fixed
upon Solly as he began talking in a low tone to the
youth. The latter, with his chin resting upon his
crutch-stick, listened attentively and with a beam-
ing smile. Suddenly he straightened himself and
stopped Solly’s eloquence with, “ I say, you know,
isn’t your name Abrahams ? ”
Yes, replied Solly, scowling at his fellow-
passengers’ sudden interest in the conversation.
Yes, that’s my name,” repeated Solly with a
hastily-constructed smile.
1 hen I’m very pleased to meet you ” was the
youth s reply as he shook hands with a vigor that
made the scared Hebrew wince. “My name’s
Jay. You may have heard about me from your
brother Ike. No ? Well I met him in Melbourne
two years ago. Guessed you were his brother
soon after you spoke to me.”
Solly’s face wore traces of many mixed emotions.
“Did you do any business with Ike?” he en-
quired, anxiously.
BEEN THERE.-A MISSIONARY ITEM
(FROM ABOVE.)
IST RETIRED MISSIONARY (exchanging experiences
in the Helds of Asphodel): “Ever been to a
cannibal feast? ”
2ND R. M.: “Fes.”
1ST R. M.: “ Onlooker?”
2ND R.M.: “No ; the feast!”
“No; we had a very pleasant time together,
but you wouldn’t call it business exactly.”
“ Good job for Solly it wasn’t business,” whis-
pered my neighbor, behind his paper. Solly’s
face had lost its troubled expression, and he smiled
indulgently at his new friend’s enthusiasm.
“ How came you to make Ike’s acquaintance ? ”
he asked.
“ Well, I’ll tell you all about it, as it’s rather a
good story,” replied the beauteous one ; and as he
included the whole company in his glance every
man put aside his paper and bent forward to
listen.
“I had just arrived in Melbourne with a chum
of mine, by the Orient; from London, you know,
where all the new-chums come from. We took
private diggings in East Melbourne, but spent
most of our time at the Bourke-street Coffee
Palace, learning to play pool with the marker.
It’s a nice, quiet billiard-room at the top of the
building, where the new-chums pass their time
when they’re not looking for billets. It was there
I met your brother. He wanted to play pool, too,
but the marker objected. However, he got very
friendly, and one day he told me in strict confi-
dence that he was connected with a racing-stable
in which was a horse that would certainly win the
Melbourne Cup, and that he was to back it for
the stable for all the money lie could get on.
“ Ike took such a fancy to me that he offered to
put £5O of mine on with the stable-money—just as
you are good enough to offer about this certainty
of yours for the Summer Cup. It’s wonderful
how so many stable commissioners take a fancy to
me.”
He turned from Solly to beam
innocently upon his fellow-
passengers. Then ad-
dressing the puzzled
Hebrew again, he
continued :
“I couldn’t
accept your
brother’s offer
because I wasn’t
very fl us h of
money at that
time, and, be-
sides, I didn’t
take much in-
terest in horse-
racing, but I told
him that my friend
had plenty of cash
to spare, and often
made a plunge on
the turf.
“‘Does he often
win?’ asked Ike.
“ ‘Not often,’ I said,
‘ he’s only a new - chum
yet, you know.’
“ ‘ Then lie’s just the chappie
I’d like to win a bit for,’ said Ike;
‘ and if you can induce him to invest a
hundred or two with me, it’ll be to our mutual
advantage.’ ”
At this part of the story Solly began to get very
restless. He had made several attempts to turn
the conversation into another channel, but the
company persisted in being deeply interested in
his brother Ike —especially the sportsman on my
left, who frequently appealed to Solly not to in-
terrupt the gentleman.
Mr. Jay seemed to take it for granted that his
reminiscences of Ike were particularly interesting
and amusing to Solly, for he spoke with a smiling,
childish enjoyment that appeared innocent of all
intention to give offence.
Watching his face carefully during the narra-
tive, so far, 1 had come to the conclusion that he
was the most fatuous ass alive. Even when Solly
got up with a smothered oath and looked out
of the. window, the lovely youth didn’t
notice his resentment. He only smiled gently,
.and pushed Solly back into
his seat.
“You really mustn’t miss
this story. It’s so very amus-
ing,” lie said.
Solly, with a hopeless glance
over las tormentor’s muscular
proportions, sat gazing at that
cherubic countenance with
speechless indignation.
‘‘ Of course I agreed with
Ike to persuade my friend to
invest, and our friendship was
cemented with a bottle of
wine and some of Ike’s best
cigars. I must say, just here,
that there was nothing mean
about your brother Ike when he
saw a chance of doing biz.
“When I told my friend
of Ike’s proposal for his
benefit, he burst out laugh-
ing. Then he asked for the
name of the horse that was
such a certainty for the Cup.
I told him your brother dared
not whisper it even in his
sleep, until the stable-money
was on, for fear of spoiling the
market.
“ ‘Ah, yes, the dead-meat market,’
said Joe, and he went off into
another fit of laughter.
,“ He always a humorous sort of chap-
pie, but I couldn’t see where the joke came
in that time. I said I thought it was a very
good opportunity.
“‘So it is,’ said Joe. ' We’ve nothing to
do at present, so you may get as many
drinks and cigars from your new friend as he’ll
pay for, until I decide how to deal with his offer.’
“ Well, I introduced Ike, and Joe occupied a few
days in making up his mind about investing £T>O
with him. After a week, however, the drinks were
getting less frequent, and the cigars were coming
from the threepenny-box, so I urged Joe to arrive
at a decision. I told him your brother Ike was
getting mean and restless. So next morning, when
Ike appeared in the billiard-room, as usual, to push
the business, Joe allowed himself to be convinced
that it was a good thing, and that the money must
go on at once. But he hadn’t his cheque-book with
him, so he arranged to meet Ike the next morning
at the bank.
“ -That night Ike opened another bottle or two,
and his cigars were above suspicion. The follow-
ing morning he waited outside the bank for three
hours. Joe apologised in the billiard-room that
afternoon for having missed the appointment,
and made another for the next day. He kept that
one, but as his watch was slow he arrived at the
bank too late to draw any money. Then he took
to making appointments further afield (some of
them were as far off as Geelong), and it was lovely
to hear him every evening explaining to Ike how
lie just missed meeting him—and to see Ike trying
to look as if it didn’t matter.
“At last, one morning when we had the room
to ourselves, Edward, the marker, asked—
“ ‘ Where is your friend Mr. Abrahams this
morning ? ’
“Joe looked at his watcli and grinned. ‘At
the present time Mr. Abrahams is enjoying the
sea-breeze at St. Kilda.’ 6
“ ‘ What’s lie doing there?’ asked Edward.
“ ‘W ai ting for me, ’ replied Joe. ‘I promised to
be there with some money he has kindly under-
taken to invest for me, but unfortunately ! missed
the train.’
“ Edward looked at Joe with a puzzled expres-
sion and said
“ ‘ You may be able to take care of yourself,
and perhaps my advice isn’t wanted, but I must
warn you against having any dealings with Mr.
Abrahams. He’s a very tricky gentleman, but I
won’t have him doing any of his funny business in
this room, and if I had known he’d gone so far as
to ask you for money, I’d have chucked him out
before this—out of the window, if necessary.’
“‘l’m much obliged for your friendly warn-
ing,’ replied Joe,’ ‘ but don’t you be afraid that
Mr. Abrahams will handle any of my money. Let
him alone until to-morrow—l shall have finished
with him then, and I’ll tell you all about it.’
“Joe then scribbled a note, which Edward pro-
mised to give Ike that evening, and for the rest of
the day we kept away from his usual beat.
MISTAKEN IDENTITY.
SCENE: Back view of Darling River pub. From a tree
hanging, covered by sheet, what looks like a dressed
sheep. Two swagmen speaking to the “ missus.”
SWAGGIE : “ Gan you give us a bit o’ meat, missus—
can’t get none nowhere.”
THE MISSUS : “ I really can’t; haven’t got a bite.”
SWAGGIE (pointing to the object): “Gam! what’s
that hangin ’ up there? ”
SHE: “ Oh, that’s my poor dear husband —hung
hisself ’bout dinner-time. I’ve sent for the
perlecce.”
“ After breakfast next morning Joe asked if I
had any old clothes to spare. I had, but Joe de-
clared they were not old enough for his purpose ;
so he went downstairs and struck a bargain with’
our landlady for a very seedy collection left by her
late lamented. Joe added an old bell-topper to
the pile, after he had carefully sat upon it and
brushed the nap the wrong way. Then he put
the whole heap upon the hall-table and called the
landlady.
Without the suspicion of a smile, he related to
her a pitiful story of how he had recently met a
young Jewish friend he had known in the old
country, and his friend had fallen upon evil days
in this strange land. Also he, the benevolent
Joseph, had consented to give him a fresh start in
a profession he had an instinctive talent for.
All he wants, Mrs. Crump,’ concluded J< e,
in a burst of
eloquence-
all be asks
is an honest
start. In half-
an-hourhewill
be here, and
will ask you if
1 left anything
for him. His
name is Abra-
hams. When
he mentions it,
don’t keep him
standing at the
door, for he is
very shy and
sensitive, and
feels his posi-
tion keenly.
Just take these
hings to the
door, and drop
them into his
arms. T hen
close the door
at once. It will
save you the
pain of listen-
ing to his ex-
travagant ex-
pressions of
gratitude. ’
“Mrs. Crump
promised t o
fol low these
instructions to
tlie letter, and
we went out.
“ ‘Now,’ said
Joe, ‘we will
go and wait
round the cor-
ner. ’
“ From the
corner of a
lane, nearly
opposite our
diggings, we
had a good
view of ike’s
approach. He
had a friend
with him. The
friend stopped
at the garden-
ga t e while
your brother
Ike went up to
the door and
smote it with
a confident
rat-tat. Th e
door opened
and our good
landlady stood
there just long
enough to ask
his name.
T h ein she
withdrew, leaving the door ajar. Ike had only
time to make a joyous signal to his friend before
the old clobber fell upon him in a shower and the
door was smartly closed.
“Ike stood for a moment paralysed, looking at
the clothes he had caught in his arms. Then he
dashed them down, and we distinctly heard his
‘extravagant expressions of gratitude’ as he
kicked Joe’s old hat through the gate and into the
road.
“ He paused for a few seconds to make a severe
remark to his friend, who clung to the railings
faint with laughter; and then strode furiously
away towards the city.
“We waited till your brother turned the
corner of the street and then hurried on to Vic-
toria Parade, and took a cab to Bourke-street.
“In a few moments Ike entered the room, and
Joe at once enquired if he had got the cheque he
left for him.
“ Ike was white with rage.
“ ‘ Cheque be damned ! ’ he cried. ‘ I called at
your lodgings and asked for it, and some idiot of
a woman shoved a lot of beastly old clothes into
my hands, and then shut the door on me like a
beggar. I never was so insulted in my life,’ he
spluttered. ‘ How the devil could she have made
such an idiotic mistake ?’
“‘No mistake at all,’ replied Joe, calmly
chalking his cue. ‘ I told her to give you those
excellent old clothes.’
“ ‘ You told her to give ’em to me? What do
you mean by it ?’
“‘Don’t spoil the gentleman’s shot,’ said Ed-
ward, waving Ike back with the jigger.
“‘Well, it was just this way,’ replied Joe, as he
potted the red ball and placed it carefully on the
spot. ‘You are only wasting your time in a pro-
fession requiring brains, for you are not smart
enough to si il the pence out of a blind man’s
hat; so I thought, in return for the amusement
you’ve given me, and the drinks and cigars lavished
upon my friend here, I would give you another
start in the old clo’ business—which is an honest
trade, and one you ought never to have left.’
“Ike was looking for a heavy cue, when Joe
added: ‘ The marker will now proceed to throw
vou downstairs. Edward, please drop Mr. Abra-
hams off the premises.’”
* * * *
Here a sarcastic railway-porter interrupted the
yarn with—
“ ‘Now then, gents, are you goin’ to the rices, or
are you goin’ back to teown ? ’ ”
We had arrived at the platform without noticing
the fact. The beauteous youth was the first to
leave the carriage, but, turning to the sullen Solly
with a smile, he said—“ I’m pleased to have made
your acquaintance, and my friend Joe will be
awfully sorry he missed doing the same. Perhaps
you will meet him in the course of business. If
you do, tell him you know me.” He tossed a card
to Solly, and strolled off up the platform. Solly
stared at the card in blank amazement. Then he
put it away carefully in his vest pocket, remark-
ing—“l was very nearly hitting the swine, but
it’s a bit of mozzle that I didn’t.”
On my way to the course I saw Mr. Jay
standing, with a group, before a gin-case
on which three cards were lying face down. The
man who was juggling with them had, in an un-
guarded moment, turned to remonstrate with
some one behind him, and another was basely
betraying this confidence in the crowd’s honesty
by exposing the picture-card to Mr. Jay, who,
when the juggler turned and offered to ‘bet him a
quid he couldn’t find the little queen ’ smiled upon
him pityingly and said—
“My good man, it would be very mean to take
advantage of your inexperience. Why don't you
emigrate to a country where you could learn your
trade ? ”
The card-fakir was struggling to frame a suitable
reply when Solly whispered something in his ear
which surprised him.
“ Well, what the ! ! does he want to
waste our time for ? ” he enquired in an injured
tone.
In the intervals of the racing I was curious

credit!”
enough to follow Mr. Jay on to the flat, and
always found him an interested spectator of “The
Monkey draws the Marble,” “ Under and Over,”
and other curious games of chance.
But Solly’s whispered information to the gin-
case man had evidently been circulated among the
fraternity, for at every table Mr. Jay visited —
whether the attraction was cards, dice, marbles or
“Spinning Jenny”—the owners thereof looked
sideways at him with a curiously shamefaced air,
as though they mutely apologised for the crude
simplicity of their little swindles, and the “hut-
toners ” slunk away from him.
I heard one of them whisper admiringly to his
mate:

like Ins at forty ! ”

CRIPPS CLARK.


That Dear Little Fool.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He had had the carriage all to himself since leaving
Wallangarra, and had fallen asleep during the
long run from Dalveen to Warwick. Someone got
in there —a girl. She herself would not have mat-
tered, but her friends did. They were of both
sexes, and their farewells were demonstrative, and
awoke the man abruptly. He was very comfort-
able where he was, and knew that girl - travellers
take a long time to settle, as a rule ; wanting
windows up and shutters down, and everything
reversed from the existing order of things. So he
did not move.
FEMININE AMENITIES.
“ He said I was the only woman he ever loved, but I can hardly
believe that.”
“Oh, it’s quite possible—he is so young that the others were pro-
bably girls. ”
The other girls kissed her ; the young men told
her to take care of herself, and prophesied that
Warwick would go into mourning at her de-
parture. Then the bell rang, and the mail-train
moved off, and the girl hung out of the window
and waved her handkerchief frantically—she was
a pretty girl, dressed simply, correctly, and ex-
pensively. Her fellow-traveller, watching her
through half-closed lids, saw that at a glance.
Presently, she took oS her sailor-hat,
put on a tweed cap, and placed a liberty-
silk cushion behind her head. Against
its deep purple her profile showed like a
cameo, and then the man remembered her.
He would discover himself to her by-
and-bye, but not yet; when he did, her
face would light in the old sweet manner,
just as it used to light when he rode up
to the horse-paddock slip-rails to give her a
bunch of buttercups gathered on the green
river-flats during the mid-day rest.
The sight of her face brought up recol-
lections of the monotonously-happy sta-
tion-life when he was jackarooing on Mis-
tral Creek—six years ago now. There
were several other young fellows gaining
experience also, but though there were
plenty of women of a sort in the neigh-
boring township, there was only one young
girl on Mistral Creek station itself—the
Boss’s 17-year-old daughter: a shy little
thing who dressed dowdily and had not
two words to say for herself. That was
wholly the Boss’s fault, for, though a
Christian in a Christianised country, he
had Oriental ideas on the subject of
women. Certainly he couldn t immure
them behind stone walls, but he discour-
aged the visits of men to his house, and
did his best to keep his daughter from
their society, with the consequence that
:she fell in love with the very first man she
was ever intimate with, that man being
Jack Sandilands. Jack had a reputation
to keep-up as the greatest lady-killer in
the district, and the very difficulties that
surrounded little Hester West made her
worth the winning.
After all, it wasn’t so difficult as he ex-
pected. Hester fell in love with him
almost at first sight, and love sharpened
her wits to design chances of meeting,
She was the frankest, most simple girl he
had ever met ; guiltless of coquetry in any
form, and that in itself wasn’t very amus-
ing. She believed in him so thoroughly
that he sometimes felt a little compunc-
tious, and wondered, when he went to
meet her after dusk in the woolshed,
whether she would risk quite so much for him if
she knew she wasn’t the only woman he was flirt-
ing with, nor yet the only woman he kissed, in the
district. But she did not know it—dear little fool
that she was !
Sometimes he would be sent for weeks to an
out-station; would chaff her on his return
about “the other fellows,” and should have been
proud of her indignant denials and of the scornful
manner in which she evidently received the
advances of others.
But, truth to tell, he was the sort of man who
would rather have enjoyed having a rival, and, liko
all men, inclined to undervalue the rose that fell at
his feet, though it were twice as sweet as its
sister “ hung high on the topmost bough.” Then
the time came when good luck stepped unex-
pectedly into his way, and he left station-life for a
town one.
The parting with the girl took place at the
horse-paddock sliprails. She cried as only seven-
teen-aud-a-half can cry—exhaustively and pro-
fusely; told him that she
loved him, and asked him
to take her away with
him. Which put him in
a very awkward situatio.',
indeed. For one thing, he
had no intention of ‘ ‘ settl-
ing-down ” for years to
come, and, for another,
this dowdily-dressed and
freckle-faced little bush-
girl, with her unformed
prettiness, wasn’t by any
means his ideal wife. But
ho was fond enough of her
to feel a perfect brute
when he explained to her
that flirtation was only a
pastime, and kissing by
no means equivalent to a
proposal. He wasn’t quite
sure, for a moment, that
he did not love her, she
looked so pathetic in the
early sunlight, leaning on
the rails with bowed gol-
den head and shaking
shoulders. Then he glanced
down at the clumsy shoes
and the badly-cut skirt
that displayed glimpses of
a serviceable, but ugly, red
flannel petticoat, and, re-
membering that the future
Mrs. Sandilands must be
stylish above everything,
and a woman to be proud
of, he rode away.
That was six years ago,
and they were together
now under very different
circumstances. The sight
of her face revived the old
half-forgotten tenderness,
and admiration leapt to
life. She was a pretty,
stylishly-dressed girl, and
looked very like his ideal
wife, at any rate. He did
not speculate as to how
she would view him ; she had been too much his
very own in those bygone days for him to have
any doubts on the subject.
He arose slowly and walked the length of the
carriage towards her, a fine specimen of manhood,
and the girl watched him critically. “Do you
remember me, Hester ? ” he said.
The girl smiled politely but vaguely.
“ Have you forgotten Mistral Creek?”
Extract from diary of Rev. Goliath Smooge, 1860; “ Have adopted the native costume to in-
gratiate myself with the people. The savage maidens , I find , are of a friendly disposition
and not uncomely.”
TEMPTATION.
MR. MICHAELSTEIN : “ Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian! ”
“ Oh, dear no ! ” —smiling charmingly now, and
holding out a slim, gloved hand. “My old home
—and yes, of course, I remember you. Just at
first I did not. It must be quite six years since I
saw you.”
“ Six !” said Jack, “ they seemed like centuries
to me.”
“ Six, is it ? But not six centuries, surely. Do
I look six centuries older ? ”
The arch look that accompanied the question
rather upset Jack’s ideas. He had expected more
shyness, a slight confusion ; and the color had
neither deepened nor paled on the rounded
cheeks; indeed he distinctly saw her give her
dress a quick little pull which displayed to the
best advantage a foam of lacy petticoat and a
slender foot in buckled shoes. Evidently she was
more taken-up with the impression she wished to
make on him than with the impression he was
making on her.
“You have altered so little that I knew you at
once,” he answered, sitting down beside her. “I
wonder if you are one-quarter as glad to see me as
I am to see you ? ” he added softly.
“ Indeed lam quite as glad. What happy days
those were at Mistral Creek —and how kind every-
one was to me ! What a pretty place it was, too.”
“ Very—especially the road through the myalls.
You remember the sliprails across it? I thought
it the loveliest spot on earth once,” he said, mean-
ingly.
“ Dear old road !” cried Miss West, enthusias-
tically. “I always think of it when I see wild
jasmine in bloom : you used to bring me great
bunches of it when you came back from muster-
ing. How glad I used to be when I saw the
chestnut with the white blaze coming over t’ •>
ridge. If I was so pleased to see you then, surely
you do not doubt my gladness now ? ”
Miss West certainly had altered from the shy
little girl who blushed at every word, and pre-
ferred to listen rather than talk.
“I am sure / never brought you jasmine—you
said the scent was too strong. I used to bring you
buttercups—and, besides I did not ride the chest-
nut with the blaze—that was one of Frank King’s
horses. Perhaps he used to bring you flowers,
too ? ” He said the last words jestingly—in those
days she would not have accepted a flower of any
sort from other hands than his.
“ Buttercups, of course—how stupid I am ! Bub
six years is such a long time, you know.”
“ Perhaps,” he said tenderly, “ you will remem-
ber the woolshed better ? ” He knew that a girl
does not easily forget her first love-kiss and its
environment, and he looked straight into her blue
eyes with his handsome bold ones. The lashes
veiled the blue ones, as he thought they would.
She was silent just one moment —then she
laughed a little.
“I ought to be ashamed of it, I suppose,” she
said ; “ but it was such fun, slipping the chaperone
to meet you. Yet I used to be rather frightened
—it was all so dark and creepy in the woolshed ;
they are ghostly places, full of echoes and weird
sounds at night. How relieved I used to feel
when I heard ‘ Annie Laurie, ’ the tune you used
to whistle all the way from the quarters —you re-
member it was our signal.”
“Me ! why I never whistled a tune in my life.
Couldn’t tell ‘ Nellie Bly ’ from ‘ God Save the
Queen ’if you paid me. Rodwell used to whistle
‘ Annie Laurie ’; surely, Hester, you did not
meet him too ! ”
A sudden fierce wave of jealousy swept over
him. Was it possible that he could be jealous of
“ the dear little fool.” For one thing, looking at
this very self-possessed young lady, he wondered if
it was really possible that he had ever, even to
himself, termed her a little fool.
“Oh, but you did whistle; I’m sure jvu did, and
ery nicely, too. Of course, I never met anyone
else but you ; I remember it all perfectly.”
He watched her sweetly-unconscious face in-
tently. “You seem misty on a good many points,
Hester; but if you have forgotten all else you must
surely remember our last parting. I recall it—as
a man recalls the mistake of a lifetime burnt into
his soul with a lifetime of remorse ’’—and he really
believed that he was speaking the exact solemn
truth, and that he always had felt as he felt now.
“ Remember ! ” cried the girl. “ One does not
forget that kind of thing. Why, my hair almost
turned gray on the spot. Goodness gracious,
what an awful rage the Pater was in ! You are
right—it teas a mistake ; we should have remem-
bered it was Saturday evening and he would be
back earlier than usual.” Then she dropped her
eyelids again until the dark lashes rested on her
cheeks. “You were just—oh, I believe you
had just kissed me! —I had my hand on
your horse’s bridle, and I had just picked
up the ash-switch. Oh, I thought father
would kill you—it was a perfect inspiration
of mine to slash your horse and make it bolt.
You ought to be everlastingly grateful to me for
saving your life. I bolted too, directly you were
off—and ran home along the bed of the creek. I
was packed-off to boarding-school after that, and
the row I got into was something dreadful.”
Sandilands sprang to his feet. “By heavens,
Hester, you have given yourself away properly
this trip ! So you were fooling me all the time,
were you, and I was a damned fool to trust to
you as I did ! I have known many women, bub
none who could act like you. No, our parting
was a very different one to that. No doubt its
details were too tame to make any lasting impres-
sion on your mind ; my successors, or predeces-
sors, I don’t know which, seem ”
“ Oh,” interrupted the girl, penitently, “ don’t
be so angry ; you should not make such a fuss
about trifles. Even supposing I did flirt a little-
why, I believe it was you who told me that flirting
was a necessary finish to a girl’s education, and
that kissing meant simply nothing at all, and
should never be taken seriously. Now, didn’t you
say so ? No, I believe it was Mr. Jones.”
As she spoke the train stopped suddenly at a
station, and Sandilands threw open the door with-
out so much as saying good-bye to his late travel-
ling-companion, and made for the smoker at the
whol e °. u H°ok was upset, his theories
shattered, his opinion of himself lowered in every
way. And this was the girl who had parted from
rum m an agony of tears ! —Rodwell, Jones, and
King—how they must have laughed in their
sleeves at him ! There is no pain equal to that of
wounded vanity ; no passion that thrives on such
meagre food as jealousy. The girl watched him
crossing the platform until he disappeared into
the smoking-carriage; then she put her foot up on
the seat and re-arranged the cushion behind her
curly head. “ Now, I wonder,” she said softly
to herself, “ which hurts the most —wounded
vanity or a broken heart ? ”

An Evergreen Coquette.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mbs. Fair, our benevolent-society’s oldest pen-
sioner, must have been very pretty when
young. Her small features are finely chiselled,
her eyes blue as forget-me-nots, and she retains
traces of a soft complexion. Local moralists pro-
nounce the .old woman “a fraud” and “a hard
case,” but she’s over 70, so most of us judge her
leniently. Once, when Mrs. Fair called at the
relieving-secretary’s for her grocer’s order, the
daughter of the house, Clara, opened the door.
“ Are’nt your legs cold, Mrs. Fair?” asked
Clara, eying the visitor’s juvenile skirts, worn
short to display feet and ankles which may once
have been shapely.
No, Miss, thank you kindly ! I never could
bear draggletails. Well do I remember when
the Lord Bishop of Tasmania stopped me cross-
ing the street in Hobart Town. Says he : ‘lf
every woman kep’ her petticoats high and dry
like yours, Mrs. Fair, there’d be more happy
usbands. Call at Bishopscourt,’ says he, ‘ and
my good lady will do you the favour of a black
silk skirt.’ ”
“ One meets few men, nowadays, like his lord-
ship, I’m afraid, Mrs. Fair. But is it true that
you’ve joined the Salvation Army ?”
It is, Miss. I was baptised, confirmed, and
married in the Church, and the Lord Bishop

trained my family in the way they should go,
though they’ve turned out disgraceful, backbiting

“ Why, what’s your objection to the Canon?”
“ He’s a heathen, Miss, and I stood up and tes-
tified the same to his face. It was this way. I
took back to the vicarage a pair of left-off boots
his wife gave me, and himself opens the door.
‘ Reverend sir,’ says I, handin’ him the parcel,
‘many thanks to your good, lady, but her boots
are too long for me.’ ”
“ How spiteful of you, Mrs. Fair ? ” said Clara,
laughing.
“ Well, I always had a small foot, Miss. When
first I married the sergeant, my shoe fell off one
day in the barrack yard, and a corporal catches it
up and shoves it inside his jumper.”
“ But what about the Canon and those boots ? ”
interrupted the listener.
“ When I gives him the bundle he says, as stiff

1 hey did but I see Ensign goin’ to my place,
.so good-bye for the present, miss.”
Clara watched the old woman lift her skirts
almost knee-high and cross the green towards the
back-gate of her tiny cottage, where a boyish
gure in uniform stood waiting. On her way the
iv lute-haired coquette paused to greet the post-
man, the gutter-sweeper, the rabbit-hawker—
every man she met.
The watcher fancied “Ensign ” seemed piqued.
At all events, as soon as he had shaken hands with
Mrs. I air and delivered her War Cry, he turned
to go, but the old woman detained him and they
stood talkingon religious subjects
—so Clara guessed from their
gestures—for some time. One
evening, a month later, the
relieving-secretary asked
her daughter to take a
warm wrapper to Mrs.
Fair, who was laid up
with influenza and,
it was feared, a
slight stroke of
paralysis. “Site’s
a forlorn o 1 d
creature,” la-
mented the
speaker ; “es-
tranged from
her children
and left to die
alone, except
for the woman
next door,
whom we pay
to look after
her. ”
When Clara
went into Mrs.
Fair’s room she
was shocked at
the change in
her old favor-
ite. All the
poor beauty’s
looks were
gone. Her
face was the
same dirty-
white as her
pillow -slip
—she seem-
ed too weak
and low
to admire
the prof-
fer e d
garment;
feebly
pushing
it aside
when Clara
. suggested help-
ing her into it for
the sake of warmth.
“ Poor dear; she’s sinking fast! ”
said a neighbour. “ When I tell
you her legs are swelling I needn’t
say no more. All evening I’ve been listen-
ing for the water rising to her chest. You can’t
nnstake when that happens. It sounds just as
. the heart inside was splashing and drownd-
mg. Now, Miss, I must get home. Mrs. Davis,
next door, has took her Rex to the doctor.
Will you stay here till she comes back v ”
Clara consented unwillingly, and bitterly re-
THE TAIL END.
BUSHIE : “Give vs a drink, boss.”
PUBLIC-HOUSE: “Got any money?”
B.: “No; ain't you got any of mine?”
J.H.: You ain't had none for o
week.”
B.: “ What'll yer give us for mv
hors?”
P.H.: “ Your horse! You drank the
last of him, two days ago.”
B.: “Be gum, it must be his tail then
that's tickling my throat. Give us a
drink.”
her promise as soon as she heard the gate
bang after her late companion. The only light in
the house was a lamp which filled the sick-room
with its smoke and smell. In the dim light the
sleepers face seemed to become more and more
ghastly, while her breathing sounded shuddering
and strangled, as if icy fingers were clutching her
windpipe.
Horrible! muttered the watcher, nibbling
her nails distractedly. “Is she going to die like
this, alone with me ? What ever shall Ido ? ”
There was a welcome knock at the door. The
girl opened it, and in stepped a uniformed youth,
whom she recognised as the Ensign. The new-
comer, a fair-haired lad with the sort of reddened
skin that always seem to be peeling off in shreds,
drew back and blushed scarlet when he saw an
unknown young woman. Clara could have hugged
turn, she was so glad of a companion. “Such a
suitable person—quite used to death-beds,” she
~ herself, as she welcomed the visitor cor-
dially.
• , or Mrs. Fair is very ill,” she explained,
going back to the bedside. To her dismay, she
saw an eerie change in her charge. The old
woman had slipped down in bed till her tightly-
shut eyes barely showed above the blankets,
gripped in her clenched hands.
Look! gasped Clara. ‘ ‘ See how she’s
dragging up the clothes, as if to hide from some-
one !
•ui Fnsign shambled nearer and stood sheep-
ishly inspecting the invalid, who slid lower in bed

man, turning to leave..

. , tt s regulytions to fetch an elderly party when
its a young officer on duty,” mumbled the
deserter, with his hand on the door-key.
Oh, dear, kind, good Ensign, don’t leave me,
whatever you do ! ’’ pleaded Clara, in desperation.
At these words, the sick woman stirred rest-
HIS SOLUTION.
NEPREW (who has dined well, to Aunt in a love-trouble): “Is ’oo sick, Auntie; did ’oo eat
too much? ”
lessly, and a troubled, almost angry, expression
disturbed . her death-like face, while her eyes,
opening slightly, shot a narrow glance from one
watcher to the other.
The emotional girl caught the look, and into her
mmd flashed the words, “Could ye not watch
with me one hour ? ”
“ What brutes we are ! ” she thought. “ Poor,
lonely, old thing! It will be forlorn enough
when she has to go out alone into the dark. And
here we are deserting her beforehand. For
Heavens sake,” she exclaimed, “say a prayer or
something ! ”
The goaded Ensign burst into song so abruptly
that both his hearers started violently—
Sweeping through the gytes of the New Jerusalem
Washed in the blood of the La-a-mb.
Sweeping through
he was shouting, when Mrs. Davis bustled in and
interrupted him. “I don’t want to, insult no
one s church, but we could do with less noise ,r
she said, snappishly.
Fortified by the presence of an “elderly party ’
the Ensign quickly regained his courage. “ Good
night, mum,” he exclaimed cheerfully as he left
the house. “Meet you in Heaven, dear young
sister ! God bless you, dying Christian ! ”
“ Now, Miss, I’ll fix her up for the night,” went
on Mrs. Davis ; “ then I’ll give Rex his ‘ Cherub’s
Bairn and turn-in myself. The lodge-doctor was
that disgusting, saying the child must have gorged
himself on the sly with green gooseberries, and
better give him ‘strap-oil’ and mustard-water.
Why Davis joined the lodge to have one in-
sulted, I don’t know.”
Then Clara took a parting peep at the patient,
who, she was pleased to see, looked relieved and
natural, and no longer cowered under the clothes.
As the girl bent over her, she murmured faintly :
lake that gownd back to your dear ma, and
tell her I’d like a pink one.”
“ Tut, tut! ” interposed Mrs. Davis ; “ there’s
twice the wear in this brown as in them washy
pinks!”
“ Tell your ma what I say,” whispered Mrs.
Fair, “and give her this message from my bed o’
pain: ‘ Keep believin’ ! ’ Don’t forget the gownd,
Miss ! ” .
“Can she be delirious?” Clara asked Mrs.
Davis; “she seemed so distressed before you
came, and kept slipping off the pillow and hiding
her face under the clothes.”
“Delirious? Not her! Soon as I come, I
knew by her look she was put-out ’cause that
young man dropped-in when she only had on an
old colored night-gown, and I hadn’t washed hei
face nor put on her white night-gown, through
Rex taking bad.” 8
Next morning Clara went to visit a relative in
the country, and did not return for some weeks.
.Passing Mrs. Fair’s cottage the day she got back,
she was startled to see the old woman at the gate,
looking' hardly more substantial than a ghost
from the tomb. The convalescent’s fluffy hair
was whiter than ever, but her wan face, with its
blue eyes and delicate features, borrowed a faint
c °l° r from her bright pink gown.
Tell your ma, Miss,” she piped, “I’ve been
thinking over what she said about a black dress
bem sintabler than a mauve, and maybe she’s
nght. But I’d like a white petticut for the
weddm.
“ Whose wedding, Mrs. Fair?”
Lor, Miss, didn’t your ma tell you about me
and the Ensign ? ”

REVENGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It chanced—no matter how or why—
Some things one need not tell—
That, in a spell of leisure, I
Was strolling round through Hell.
And there I saw a cage full tall
That was, by some strange whim,
Shaped like an editorial
Waste-paper basket grim.
And in that cage, like kerosene,
There burned in torture sore
The soul of one who once had been
A Sydney editor.
And like a demon in D-T’s,
There danced around the cage
A Shape that laughed in agonies
Of diabolic rage.
As round the cage the coal it piled,
I saw the Shape perspire
Till it was in a lather wild
Of soot, and sweat, and fire.
This sight my spirit so unnerved
That for a space I leaned
On Satan’s shoulder, and observed—
“ Who is this fearsome fiend °! ’’
Then Satan said, with humor dire,
“I thought that you would know.
A writer ’tis who feeds the fire
That roasts his ancient foe.
“He might have been in Heav’n—ah me
Amongst the cherubim;
But he preferred down here to be,
For this is Heav’n to him 1 ”
So to that editor you see
Of all his glory stripped,
He reads—while piling coals so free —
He reads through all eternity
Rejected manuscript,
C.R.
Gazetted.

“ And the affair never leaked out ? ” I said.
“ Not to the public, at all events,” said the man
who had seen the thing done, and who told me the
story. “We knew how to keep our mouths shut.
What was the use of making a fuss about it, any-
how ? ”
“ And if I tell it now ? ”
“ Tell it!” he said.
And here it is.

Island-trading schooner Wasp fetched the en-
trance to the lagoon early in the forenoon. She
hove-to, and showed a signal for a pilot. Then
Capt. Sanders went below At length a boat
came across the lagoon under a press of sail. She
luffed-up smartly alongside, and a man rose in the
stern-sheets a little, skinny fellow, with a
humped back, a beardless, wizened face, and a
tousle of red hair under a greasy cloth cap.
“ BULLETIN ” ADVT.
No. III.
“ Everybody is astonished at your ‘Cow-
Soap.' keeps the milk wonderfully
clean.” (Signed) JAMES CORNSTALK.
As he swung over the side the captain stepped
on deck, stopped short, and stared with the face
of an unbeliever who suddenly sees an indisput-
able ghost. The newcomer collapsed against the
rail and shook as if he would have a fit.
“ Spinnox ! ” the captain gasped—reeled, and
tumbled down the companion-ladder. The hunch-
back lifted a grinning face, and shook harder:
“ Captain Sanders! ”
When he went below a minute later he found
the captain seated at the cabin table. He leaned
his crooked shoulders against the bulkhead, and
grinned like a cat.
“ Quite a happy and unexpected meeting, isn’t
it, cap. ?” he said. “ You signal for a pilot, and
you find a friend long lost to sight but to memory
dear, as the song says. What a queer world we
live in, after all! Well, well ! ”
The captain silently stared at him.
“ You didn’t expect to see me, cap. ?”
The captain licked his dry lips. “No ! ”
“Of course. Thought I was dead. Let’s see—
two years ago, wasn’t it ? And all that time I’ve
been hungering for a sight of my old friend’s
face.”
His old friend’s face was twitching in a curious
fashion.
“ Who’s your mate now, cap. ?”
“ Got none.”
“No?”
The captain made invisible diagrams on the
table with a shaking forefinger.
“ What happened ? ”
“Fell overboard.”
“ Whew ! Dark night ? ”
The captain made diagrams.
“ Boat dropped—couldn’t find him ? ”
The captain made diagrams.
“Most likely hit his head against something,
and sank like lead—eh ? Just a cry and a splash,
and that was all—eh ? ”
“ I don’t know anything about it.”
Spinnox slid to the floor, and again his body
shook in that strange way—shook to an inward,
soundless laughter that was likely
to choke the man.
, “ Quite a trick of your mates —this
getting overboard. One of ’em did
the same two years ago—that was me.
Just hit my head, and went under.”
The captain was breathing hard, like
a man who had been running.
“ Hit my head against a belaying-pin
—which had somehow got out of its place,
and was waving about at the end of a
man’s arm. I went under, came up, and
managed to keep myself afloat for a couple of
hours. Then I was picked-up.”.
The captain breathed harder.
“See, cap. !” The hunchback showed a livid
scar through his tangled mane. His eyes glinted,
but his voice never rose. “See —where I hit the
pin,”
“Blast you !” The captain leapt up, foaming.
“Stow that cursed rot, will you? Next time,
you’ll hit the pin harder.”
Spinnox jumped to his feet, pointed a thin fore-
finger, and laughed.
“ Sit down, cap.,” he said. “ Let’s talk fair.”
And, queerly enough, the captain sat down, and
his rage oozed away in little mutterings of oaths
and threats. It was the mastiff cowed by the
terrier. But the dogs had met before.
“See, cap., I’m tired of this shore business. I
want to feel the sea under me again. What more
natural than that I should take my old berth—
mate of the Wasp, eh ? ”
The captain looked up once with wide eyes;
then he dropped them and sat silent while he
made a more elaborate diagram on the table.
“ Want to ship with me again—eh ?” he said at
last.
“ That’s it. Let bygones be bygones, and the
rest of it.”
“I’ll take you.”
* • * •
First day out from the island came a mystery
aboard the Wasp. A revolver-shot was heard in
the captain’s cabin. Mate Spinnox, who went to
investigate, was told with many emphatic compli-
ments through the closed door to mind his own
business. After that at odd times when the cap-
tain was below a regular popping of shots kept all
hands marvelling.
Taylor, the white-headed oracle of the fore-
castle, shook his head solemnly, but was other-
wise dumb. Half-wit Norris, the cook, with the
temerity of unreason, made a long shot. “He’s
going mad,” he said —a view that was literally
hammered upon the crew in the days following,
what time the skipper was on deck, for Captain
Sanders was a “hazer.” But Spinnox sought for
the method in this madness. Speculation was
resultless ; the thing demanded action. Spinnox
burgled the captain’s cabin during its owner’s
absence on deck. He found screwed to the bulk-
head a lead-splashed iron plate, bearing in white
paint the rude drawing of a man’s head.
“ Humph !” thought the mate, “Pistol-prac-
tice. Must have a reg’lar arsenal aboard.
Smith-and-Wesson never made those splashes.
Something lighter—something in the half-gun,
half-toy style. Practice good, too —centres, most
of ’em. But why ?—why ? ”
The remainder of that day he pondered in an
idle, speculative kind of way. By the next, the
thing had become a personal matter : he found
himself drawing mental pictures of a man’s head
upon the sails and twisting the gear into sundry
notes of interrogation.
“ Now ivhat’s the old man up to ? ” The hunch-
back paced the deck, still in a fog. Suddenly he
stopped short, cocked his wizened face, and
winked solemnly at a star that showed prominently
above the foremast. “Why, it’s me! The old
man’s plumping lead into my figurehead. Well,
that is a queer amusement. Safer than belaying-
pin's, though, for me —much safer.”
He stood for a full minute, shaking his soundless
laughter into the teeth of the warm night-wind.
Then he winked cheerfully at his stellar confidant,
and paced again like a man who has found a
pleasant solution to a troublesome problem.
* * * *
The moon turned a wan half-face from the upper
west. The wind was steady and fair. The
Wasp hummed through the moonlit sea. Spin-
nox had the deck. Half-wit Norris, squatting
against the weather side of the foremast, scraped
solace for a wounded jaw—the result of a blow
from the captain’s fist—and lugubrious discord
from a cheap violin, droning the beats slowly:
“One—two —three —four.” A couple of hands,
stretched on the forecastle, were negotiating a
wager as to how long the captain would tolerate
the half-wit’s noise.
Spinnox trod the deck with the noiseless steps
of a cat. Unconsciously, he marched to the
fiddler’s measure: “One —two —three—four.” He
fell into a pleasant reverie, and had no eye for
anything.
“One —two ...”
The sudden break in the monotone spun him
round like a vane in a veering wind, and—he met
the captain’s eye sighting him above a long-bar-
relled revolver.
Astonishment held everybody moveless. The
mate just stood, head thrust forward, staring and
making little clicks like a man trying to swallow
with a dry throat. Half-wit Norris turned
shocked face on the pair, his bent arm up, as it
paralysed in mid-air. The men on the forecas
crouched low, and stared, scarcely breatmng. ±ne
helmsman gripped the spokes with steel fingers.
Thus, for a full minute—and the expected shot
did not come. • ,
Suddenly, hunchback Spinnox pattered across
the deck like a monkey, rapidly shaking himself
into a frenzy. _ . ,
His movement lifted the spell. N orris pressed
a swollen jowl to the violin, and mechanically
took up his interrupted counting in a
hysterical way—“ three —four.” The men forward
sat up, shook cold sweat from their forelocks, and
And, all the time, there was the captain grinning
along the Smith-and-Wesson barrel. It was a
queer thing ! Laugh at it; call it momentary
paralysis, failure of volition —anything. The cap-
tain had fired so often in imagination at Spinnox
that he had lost the power to do it in reality. _
The mate was leaning against the side, shiver-
ing, and laughing idiotically. Suddenly lie
wrenched a belaying-pin from the rail, and stepped
forward. His a£m made a swift movement. The
pin whirled like a metal wheel through the dim
moonrays—straight to its mark. The captain just
crouched, turned half round, and crumpled to the
deck. The falling revolver sang a bullet into the
foremast above the fiddler’s head.
“Resignation of Captain Sanders ! ” screamed
the hunchback.
He was a veritable madman. He scampered
about the deck, cursing horribly. Norris cried
aloud at his approach, lifted the face of a
frightened child, and rolled to his back, whimper-
ing. The men, with the unanimity that terror
brings, dived for the forecastle scuttle. Aft, the
helmsman thrust the inscrutable face of a sphinx
across the wheel.
Spinnox saw none of these things. He sprang
into the rigging and shinned up. He swiftly rove
a rope and slid down a backstay. He slipped a
bight of the rope around the supine captain’s
neck, and, in an instant, had him swinging aloft
streaming out to leeward, like a ghastly pennant,
with the list of the schooner.
“ Resignation gazetted 1 ”
Hands on his hips, he stood watching, in a sort
of drunken ecstasy, the swaying of the suspended
figure. Then he sprang again into the rigging.
He parted the rope witli a swift knife-stroke.
“ Signed—Spinnox /”
The helmsman heard a splash in the sea.
* ¥ * *
Now, log-books are popularly supposed to be
strictly accurate chronicles, but a queer discrepancy
appeared in the two records of this one event,
For, when the Wasp reached Sydney, the log
simply ran, in the neat hand of Mate Spinnox:
“ Dec. —, Captain Sanders washed overboard and
drowned. Lat. —, long. —.”

“ Gentlemen,” said the auctioneer, when
presiding at a sale of choice station-lots, “the
property I am about to submit to your notice to-

I can only call your attention to tbe facts that if
you should call at any time you think fit you will
find the manager drunk, the superintendent in-
toxicated, the overseer just suffering a recovery,
the book-keeper in d.t.’s, and the station hands
more or less in a state of booze —and yet, gentle-

that the station pays handsomely. Now then,
favor me with a bid for this exceptional lot of real

THAT OLD JOKE.
HEN this old Joke was new they clinched
With saurians in the slime :
They rode to fight on griffins grey
In warrior garb of grime.
Their heads were all a-bulge behind,
Their foreheads scarce in view
They’d just commenced to lose their tails
When this old Joke was new.
And then it died, this ancient Joke,
And slept for many a year,
Till Neolithic jesters came
And re-begot the jeer.
And, as they passed the humor-round,
Loud laughed the savage crew,
And thanked the gods who gave them breath
When such a Joke was new.
It died again—and rose again,
A Ghost of Laughing-Gas ;
It ran its race through days of Bronze
To this dear Age of Brass.
It’ s set a million eyes a-blink,
A million mouths askew—
It blooms a pure perennial jibe
This Joke antique, but new.
And all the wits of all the world
Are freshly travail-torn
When, year bv year - in labor dear,
This babe of Joy is born.
And each one swears the others lie
In claiming credit due
(He felt the pangs on Thursday last
He knows the Joke is new),
And ages wax and ages wane,
The stars grow dim and cold,
The prophets sleep in slumber deep,
The hero’s heart is mould ;
Pur skies are pale, our beer is stale,
Our outlook’s rather blue,
Unto all things old is a death-knell tolled
But the Joke—is always knew.

We Dreamed.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
And we, we dreamed of love and stars, and waters
deep,
Of shining gleam-kiss’d waves and tears,
Of fallen worlds, torn from a wilderness of lights—>
We dreamed of whips, of staves and spears,
The broken garment of the night, the solemn rise
Of sun and sky, the bubbling note
Of birds new-waked, the whistling of the urchin
wind,
The white sail of a fisher-boat.
The long red line of dead and squatting hills of
.sand,
The smell of salt combined with bloom,
The sweetest minglement of needle-prick and kiss
Of fire resin-fed and gloom.
We sqw the broad-beaked, heavy-headed water-
bird
Drop like a shining stone from sight,
Or as a star, weak from long holding at the dome,
Lets loose and’s shotten thro’ the night.
We dreamed of torches, and of tigers’ yellow eyes,
Of shredded scarlet-threaded smoke,
Of burnt brown lazy arms and bits of unwashed
gold,
Of bird-note and of bull frog croak.
And snow-pale fleets of water-lilies and green
leaves,
Of bursting nuts and falling rain,
Of God, of single tears, of kneeling men, and much
That coupled heart with muscle-pain.
We dreamed of kings who fought with kings, like
dogs for bones,
Their dust b’own up against the moon,
All hair and crowns, and spotted with hot quarrel
blood,
Their stockings sinking to their shoon.
Of brazen bishops, kissing girls and dancing jigs,
Or eating cheese inside the church ;
Of lawyers talking medicine and swapping wigs,
Of schoolboys knowledgeless of birch.
Of muffled boat-oars and of flat-boned prancing
mares,
Of watching men ’neath stretching trees;
Of littlelakes, looking’s if God had spat them there,
Of ruined roses in a breeze ;
Of heavy soulless smiles reflected in a glass,
Of cups of poisoned amber wine ;
Of burnt-out flambeaux, cracking in a deathly dark
And fusing out a scent of pine.
Of woman-arms outspread for love, of gleaming
teeth,
Of pillowed folds of thick-rolled hair,
Of panting tiny breasts, and whispered naughtiness
Of Cupid in a gold-got lair ;
Of one who trode a midnight road with fright-
tight fist,
Of drunken bending shrubs, of hills
Low-browed and beetling, shelterless, begowned
with mist
That catches at the throat and chills.
Of fire and cake and ale, of blue tobacco-smoke,
Of rousing ten-voiced chorus songs ;
Of the wee chuckling of the clock before we woke
And broke the withey slumber thongs.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Advertising for a wife is generally considered a
rather humorous affair, and when the subject is
mentioned in that station of life where people
usually have enough to eat, plenty to wear, and
sleep between fresh linen sheets, it is apt to raise
a smile. In reality, advertising for a lady corres-
pondent with a view to matrimony is a very
pathetic affair, as I recently found out. I was
seized with a desire to discover what manner of
people they are who go to the large daily paper
for a life-partner, and accordingly inserted in the
greatest daily of them all the following advt. at
the cost of Is. for each insertion :
j\/rATRIMONY. Man about 30, fair position, wishes
correspond refined, educated young woman,
view to above.
It wasn’t much of a bait. Variations of it were
inserted three times, and—is it a credit to the
advertising worth of that Sydney paper or a slur
on the economic credit of our alleged civilisation —
the applicants for that man and his fair position,
particulars unknown, were 91. Of the 91, less than
six, judging by their letters, were “ fast ” women.
Most of the 91 letters were ill-written and had
mistakes in spelling and grammar all over them.
Some were very guarded; some were painfully
frank and gave personal particulars as to height,
complexion, disposition, inclinations, and financial
status. One lady said she hadn’t a blemish on her
whole body barring two moles, one on her right
shoulder and the other just above her knee. She
was evidently a prize, and knew her own matri-
monial value. Some had a little money saved ;
some had a home but no regular income ; some had
their own furniture, but found it hard to pay the
rent and cost of living. Some had only their looks
and nice ways. A very few wrote merely that
they had observed the advertisement and would
be pleased to meet the gentleman whenever it was
convenient for his lordship. But these casual-
PAINTING THE LILY.
THE GIRL : “ But you’re NOT going to take me into dinner. Mother insists on your taking in
Mrs. Tonwait.”
THE JORNRY: “ What, Mrs. Tonwait going to dine! How hideously unnecessary !”
minded ones were few. The majority were in
deadly earnest.
The first lady who was to be honored with an
appointment made her own arrangements, and
named a busy street right in front of a public
office. She was to carry a red flower, while the
writer was to display a white tie and wear his hat
on one side. Time, 8 o’clock.
Ten minutes before the time I found a small,
dumpy woman in a very stained dress, glancing
up and down the street, while every now and
again she waved a red paper flower up and down in
a slow, deliberate, public sort of way. She couldn’t
wave it over her head, for in one hand she carried
a bag stuffed full of vegetables and paper pack-
ages. Under her other arm was a paper parcel,
from one end of which protruded a most aggres-
sive mutton-shank. The girl was not pretty, not
even attractive. Her eyes were small and peery,
and were almost submerged
in the rolls of fat which
formed her face.
Fortunately she turned
out to be only the servant;
her mistress had sent her
to watch and bring word
if the advertiser was a de-
cent-looking individual or a
larrikin. Apparently the
girl was satisfied, and in a
few minutes the mistress
appeared, in a black silk
blouse and a tailor-made
skirt and jacket, with her
head adorned by one of the
latest things in toques.
There was an odour of
opopanax, a gleam of brace-
lets and jewellery, and a
general aroma of well-to-do
moral laxity about this
charming dame. She told
her name and address (both
of which were false), and
proposed a trip to Manly,
so that we could talk. Was
much impressed by my
courage in addressing her
maid. Was I really look-
ing for a wife, or only for
a romance. There wasn’t
much romance in mar-
riage, for a man, but for a
woman there was whole
stacks. She had her own home, plenty to
live on ; but, after all, life to a woman was very
dull without a husband to look after her. Why
(growing earnest and confidential) she would
sooner have a husband who beat her occasionally
than none at all. She knew lots of men, but they
were too staid and respectable—she admired a
man who was a bit of a devil. What was the
advertiser’s screw? Only £3 per week—well, it
wasn’t much, but she had about as much and a
free house, and with the two combined they ought
to have good sport. Still, she didn’t fancy me
much. I had a limp ; she didn’t like limps. Also,
she rather admired curly hair, whereas mine—she
told me frankly—was as straight as a rat’s tail.
But, no doubt, I had courage. The man who
could keep an appointment with a woman loaded
with vegetables and meat and waving a red
paper flower up and down in George-street was a
hero, and she just adored courage. She would
like to correspond for a while and see if she grew
to like me a bit more.
She prattled on like that for three hours. Then
I got her home, and found out that the first ad-
dress was a lie. She was the only person I met
out of the crowd, bar one other, whose story was
not full of pathos.
The second lady was shy. It was a long time
before she could bring herself to meet a man she
didn’t know. She was a sad little thing, with big,
grey eyes and white, shell-like face. She was a
widow, toiling at service to rear and educate a
little son, who was getting on for seven. She
would be a good wife. She could cook nice things,
and was skilled in the making of conserves and
condiments, and she would be so grateful to any
gentleman who would be a father to her little boy
that she was certain she should love him passion-
ately in a very little while. Her little boy was
such a bright little fellow. He was living in
Bourke-street—would I come round and see the
little chap ? She wished him to have a good edu-
cation, and grow up a good and, perhaps, a great
man. And she looked up through the cold moon-
light with great, grey, wistful eyes—and I wished
that the earth would open and swallow up all cads
and fools who try to look into women’s psycho-
logical depths. It was terrible—l had to stop her
somehow. I took her hand, and told her shame-
facedly that I was already married, and was only
a journalist looking for information —something to
write about; and asked for her forgiveness. She
looked at me through a little mist, and said softly,
“ And I took you for quite a gentleman ! ”
The next eleven were just like her; poor
crushed women, left unprovided for by dead hus-
bands. Some were left by husbands who had
gone to seek fortunes in Westralia, and had only
written once or twice, and never come back —the
nan who goes West, it
would seem, seldom does
come back, unless he comes
crushed and broken. Some
had simply fallen victims to
other piratical women, who
had come along and lured
their husbands from them
by the lust of the eye. But
all all, were
pathetic. They were hungry
for a better time, and they
had only their bodies and re-
spectability to barter for
that better time, and the
joys and comforts of a home,
and they told of their quali-
fications and their abilities,
and when their arms were
plump they tried to indicate
the fact, nicely and- uncon-
sciously, in a heart-breaking
way.
Then there Was a girl,
who admitted quite frankly
that she had fallen was
goingto be honest, and would
make no man marry her
by telling him lies. She
spoke half-defiantly, and un-
der a strong sense of- injury,
and with an evi lent desire
to avoid even the appear-
ance of deceit. Her baby
was born in the Benevo-
lent Asylum. She wrote to
its father before she went
there, and found that he
had gone God-knows-where.
So when she L.t the Asylum she had to
take a place where they would let her
have her baby with her. No, she wouldn’t
part with it till it was ole 1 enough to
tell her when it was ill-treated. She wasn’t
going to let any murdedng baby - farmer
grab her money and kill her child. She got no
wages, on account of having the child with her.
She just earned shelter and food for both of them.
Yes, she was sick of it, but when she looked at
the baby it pulled her together again. How did
she dress? Well, she didn’t dress properly. The
woman who sweated her gave her cast-offs, and
asked the women-lodgers to do the same; and
when they did give them they mostly bemoaned
the loss of the money they would have got for
“them things, quite good and respectable,” in
Bathurst-street. Of course, the woman had to
keep her decently covered for her own credit’s
sake. She couldn’t have the housework done by
a naked girl, so she clothed her in a sort of way,
and growled about it. She had borrowed that
cape and skirt from a lady-lodger, to whom she
had explained that she had answered an advt.,
IN “PUSH”
SOCIETY.
CHOPPER MARKS
(addressing the
assembly at the Rooks dance-
room): “Ay! They's goin ' to be a benefit
for Jago-ye all know Jago—'im as is jist

Blokes a deener, girls a nod.”
and the gentleman wanted to meet her to see if
she would do. She wished to Hod she could get
married. She was strong and healthy. The baby
was strong and healthy and would cost him
nothing, and she’d take in needlework to support
it —she made all her mistress’s clothes as well as
doing all the housework and the cooking and the
washing and the ironing. Did I think I’d care to
marry her ? She’d gone wrong once, but I could
bet my soul she’d never go wrong again, and she
would be a better wife for what had passe 1.
And hereabouts I began to wonder if it was all
a dream that we had sent men to South Africa to
kill Boers for tyrannising over whites. There
seemed to be some whites in this country that
wanted rescuing badly, and there seemed to be
some she-devils at home that wanted rooting out
of the land.
I had had enough of interviews. I burnt the
remainder of the letters, and kept only one more
appointment, which it was too late to cancel. But
this one was cast in a different mould. She stood on
the steps of the park, buttoning her glove with the
calm assurance that betokens the permanent
presence of half-crowns in the purse. She was 35,
and had contempt—witherin r contempt—for a
woman who was afraid to tell her age. She had
her own home, and if the advertiser wished to look
at the deeds, he could, just to satisfy himself that
there was no mortgage. She would prefer him to,
for she wanted a reference to his employers to
prove that he was in a permanent billet and bore a
good character. Yes, she’d go into the park and
sit down—but, look here : There was nothing
crooked about her. She was a respectable woman,
and she had kept this appointment in good faith.
She had this thing with her (pulling out a neat
short-barrelled revolver), and if the case called for
it she would use it without hesitation. If he was
a gentleman he would find her, she hoped, a
pleasant and interesting companion. I tried to
create no necessity for the use of the dreadful-
looking shooter, and after some interesting con-
versation, took her home with great respect, and
held my hat in my hand as I said good-night.
HERMES.


King Tawhaio's Ngerengere.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“That business of Karepa’s in the river, said
Henderson, ‘ ‘ reminds me of Tawhiao’s ngerengere.
Egad, it was a circus ! ”
“ Hand the billy over here.”
“He was the Maori king, you know—some
pumpkins, I can tell you—and went to England
to see Queen Wikitoria about some land trouble.
“There was the king, a chief called I atara,
another, Te Wheoro. who could speak a little Eng-
lish ; I forget the third; but anyway the king had
a bad time. „ , ,
“ Kimberley was Colonial Secretary. He told
the king to go back and put his trouble before the
Government here ; it had nothing to do with
Downing-street—the king couldn’t see Wikitoria
on any account, not if he presented fifty green-
stone ‘ meres ’ and a hundred kiwi mats.
“ Tawhiao couldn’t understand. He knew that
Wikitoria was a big rangatira, but so was he. He
wasn’t eaten up with pride, but he thought they
might have a korero together. But it was no go.
The British Government is dunder-headed. Are
you listening ? ”
“Yes. It’s first-rate. But when are we com-
ing to the yarn ? ”
“.Yarn be bio wed !—this is the yam. Pass me
some bread—no, not with your fingers. Here,
take my sheath-knife.”
“ There you are. Fire away.”
“ The king put it all down to occult influences
which were working against him; he became
pouri ; he thought he had ngerengere (leprosy).”
“ Hold on,” said Karepa. “ I makee t’e talk. I
know when Tawhiao went to see Wikitoria. You
think it pecause his mana no good. That not it.
The king break his tapu aboard a ship, and then
ewerryt’ing go wrong wit’ him. Never mind,
Governor, Premier, Secretary. They think they
keep Tawhiao off from Wikitoria, but all t’e
Governor and Premier in Noo Seelan’ and
Ingarangi not stop the king, if his mayia all right.”
“ But how was it broken ? ”
“ I make-a-talk,” said Karepa., with half a
pigeon in one hand and his pannikin in the other.
“On board a ship were all sort plenty waiter-men
—taurekareka ewerryone—to bring food for the
king and t’e chiefs. These men not see the mana
belonga Tawhiao ; they not see the proper tikanya
to use wit’ so bik man ; they not see how werry
tapu he was. They pring his kai (food) allasame
as to ewerrypody on board a-that ship.
“ One stooard was werry bad man, worse of all.
He stand pehind when t’e king eat. He play t’e
tewil. But worse of all, he carry the kai pehind
the king, and put it ofer his shoulder. He touch
Tawhiao ; the ship gif a bik roll—he spill the lcai
ofer the king. That make Tawhiao feel bad—he
know all about it—an’ when he get to Ingarangi,
he no got a bit of tapu left. Ewerryt’ing go
wrong wit’ him.”
“ Have it how you like—this is my yarn, said
Henderson. “ The old boy came down to me in
his distress. I was living in a little village, 20
miles out of London. He said he was ngerengere.
But I couldn’t see anything wrong with him.
When I told him so, he pointed to his eyebrows,
and said they had come out. That was a sign the,
disease was working. ”
“I don’know,” said Karepa. “I ink he tell
you somethin’ make-a-talk.”
“Anyhow, that’s what he said.”
‘ I know. He tell you, and you say, ‘ Ah, that
good talk.’ But he no tell t’e trut’. He no tell
the pakeha too much.”
“ Am I going to tell the yarn, or are you going
to take it in hand yourself ? ”
“I tell t’e kauwhau, t’e good old talk. I
tell t’e korero tupuna; I talk of Maui.
Ngahui, all t’e big men—l no talkee
t’e lie, t’e korero tara.” The old
SIGNS OF THE TIMES.
UNCLE: “Veil, Tommy, father out of vork again,
and no food in the house, I suppose?”
TOMMY: “Don’t it look like it—if there was any
tucker about we shouldn’t be a-poppin' of the
Hat-iron and the saucepan , should we?”
man’s eyes twinkled. “ You makee t’e talk, makee
t’e finish ; I smokee t’e pipe.”
“ Right,” said Henderson, taking his plug from
his pocket, and throwing it across to Karepa.
“ It’s a bargain—you don’t open your mouth till
I’ve done.” , „ T .
“That it. You makee t’e talk—l makee te
smoke. I like that way.” ,
Henderson paused, to test the old man s words,
and Karepa filled his pipe in perfect silence.
“Our housemaid called herself 'Phemia; the
cook was plain Jane. Both were callow country
girls, with a wholesome horror of black men.
“I explained to them the nature of our expected
visitors. ‘ln the country where I come from,’ I
said, ‘the natives are a very superior people.
They have been called the noblest savages in the
world. It’s true, they sometimes tattoo their
faces, and some folks object to the habit. But
you needn’t be frightened—these that are coming
here are the king and three of the biggest chiefs.
Of course, you’ll treat them just as if they were
white people, like vou and me. ’
“The girls left the room as if they’d been sen-
tenced to five years each, and had a confab in the
kitchen.” .
“ But how about the wisdom of taking a pros-
pective leper into your family ? ” .
“ I never mentioned that. I didn’t know it till
he arrived, and then I thought the old boy s super-
stitions had misled him. .
“I met them at the railway-station. Iliere
was no sensation. First came the king and I,
then two of the chiefs, and lastly the third chief
and the interpreter who had piloted them. down.
They were dressed au pakeha, in the height of
fashion—black coats and tall hats.
“When we turned into the High-street, we
were joined by three small school-children, two
boozers from the Swan Inn, the butcher’s boy, old
Tracey, the grocer, who took an interest m
missions to the heathen, Miss De Vine, daughter
of the lord of the manor, in her pony-carriage,
and half-a-dozen dogs. .
“ The king stopped at Ibbotson s clothing-shop.
He wanted to buy something, he said. Like a
well-bred Maori, he took no notice of the stir he
was causing, but walked straight into the shop
and took off his coat.
“He wanted a woollen vest. But he was hard
to please, and the whole shop had to be turned
upside-down before he was suited. He chose a
thick, white jersey, tried it on over his waistcoat,
and paid down his money like a white man.
“Now, the old chief who had come along
behind was a perfect devil. The humor of the
situation seemed to tickle him, and while we were
in the shop he ‘ pulcana’d ’ at the crowd outside.
You know what that is. It seemed pretty funny
to him and the interpreter, but one young girl had
hysterics, and Miss De Vine’s horse shied.
Karepa, who was following the yarn, recognised
the word pukana, and gave a performance by way
of illustration. He rolled his eyes till only the
whites of them showed ; he lolled his tongue with
the air of a semi-idiot; he danced a few unmean-
ing steps; then he rushed upon us with an un-
earthly howl, and snatched at us with his long
bony hands. .
“Yes,” said Henderson, “that was something
like it, but he had more tattoo than you. He
ever such a demon.”
Karepa sat down, and re-lit his pipe.
“That frighten t’e pakeha, I t’ink.”
“It made the village constable want to arrest
the old chief, there and then, but I took the fellow
aside, ‘Look here, Coster,’ I said, ‘be lenient.
The man doesn’t mean anything. Thatsafo o
of greeting in his country.’ Which is quite true
Karepa will bear me out. ‘ I’ll be responsible for
him. I’ll see he behaves.’ I put a
half-a-crown into Coster’s hand. ‘Be
lenient,’ I said; ‘be lenient.’
“ The effect was magical.
“‘Stand back, there,’cried Cos-
ter, with a majestic wave of the
hand —the one that held the half-
crown, ‘Give the gen’leman
room. Jimmy Philmore,’ —to
the butcher’s boy—‘ now you
go on. They’ve been wait-
ing for that there sirloin
at the doctor’s this ’arf-
hour. Stand out of the
way, there, an’ let these
gen’lemen pass.’
“We marched off
triumphant, the king
carrying the jersey
over his arm, and half the village
following.
“Euphemia opened the front
door. She never said anything,
but she looked as if she was witness-
ing a scene in ‘ Deadwood Dick tortured
by Indians,’ ‘ The Apache Squaw,’ or ‘ The King of
the Cannibals.’
“We had dinner, but it was a tame affair. The
king wouldn’t eat, and the chiefs didn’t seem to
have much appetite ; but the man who had done
the pukana business drank any quantity of beer.
“That night we had a circus.
“Before sundown
the king got me to
take him to the
river. ‘ What he
wants,’ said the in-
terpreter, ‘is a bit
of running water
with a pebble-bot-
tom, where he can
do his ablutions, and
say his karakia and
put up a tuaahu.’
“The difficulty
was that all the
streams around
there had mud bot-
toms. But I took
them to a place
where the river
had been gravelled
for a ford. That
suited fine.
“We sat in the
smoking-room till
midnight.
“The king hardly
spoke at all. He
simply said that
when he had done
the proper karakia
he would get rid of
his disease. ‘ But,’
I said to the inter-
preter, ‘ I see no-
thing wrong with
him. I know a few
of the symptoms —
brownish spots,
swellingof thelobes
of the ears. He
has nothing of that
sort. What if his
eyebrows are com-
ing out ? ’
“ ‘ I diagnose the
case as one of me-
grims, ’ said the in-
terpreter. ‘ He’s
got a sort of melan-
choly, a sort of
home-sickness, and
he doesn’t know
what it is. Natur-
ally, he believes it
must be a touch of
the evil-eye, but he
says it’s ngerengere.
That’s a Maori’s
way. A Maori’s
very secret about
his superstitions.
He’ll be all right
when he’s put up
his altar and said
his prayers.’ ”
“That’s what
the interpreter
said?” It was I
who spoke. “ It’s
about as clear as
mud ; but go on.”
“You’re darned
complimentary ! ”
“it was the in-
terpreter I was
referring to. You’ re
clear enough —of
course.”
“At midnight
the king got up
and asked the chiefs
to follow him. They
n n
all went out. Ihe . .
interpreter and I weren’t asked to go ; we weren t
wanted. , , ,
“ But I went down to the gate to see em on.
They were as gloomy as a funeral.
“They hadn’t gone a hundred yards when a
figure rose from the ditch on the other side of the
road, where the elm-trees grew. ,
‘ ‘ Jt was Coster ; he’d been watching the house.
“ ‘ I’m not comfo’ble about them furnners o
yours, Muster Henderson,’ he says; ‘they’re arter
suthin’. I’m not easy.’ . „ ,
“There was no sense in explaining; Loster
would never understand about karakia, ov makutu,
or nyerengere. ‘ Come in and have a drink, I
“ ‘ Nary a drop,’ he says. ‘ Dooty’s dooty. And
my dooty’s to see what them black chaps is up to.
I left ’em in your charge, an’ you let ’em oft ■ the
chain like this. I’m disapp’inted, Muster Hen-
derson ; most disapp’inted. But I wish you good-
Mlold on, Coster,’ I said, ‘ I’ll come with you.
I know exactly where they’ve gone.’
“ The Maoris went by the road, but we cut
across the fields and got to the ford first. We
crossed by a footbridge, and hid behind some
bushes on the further side. Five minutes later,
the Maoris came down to the river and did a lot
of subdued talking on the other side. Then the
three chiefs retired behind a hedge, and the king
was left alone.
“ The old boy put his tall hat on the grass, took
off his clothes, and got into the water.
“There was a willow growing on our side
of the river, and he waded across to this and
pulled off two or three wands, and stuck them
into the bank. Then he got back into the river,
and began his karakia.
“It was the weirdest sort of picnic, with
Coster’s teeth chaptering with fright, and the
king saying his mournful prayers in the water,
and the three chiefs ready to stoush us if they
knew we were there. ,
“But the first karakia was got through safely,
and the king splashed the water, as Karepa did.
Then he began to karakia again. Altogether, he
dismissed the evil spirits to about seven places,
and then he got right down into the water.
“ After that he recrossed to the other bank, and
put on the new jersey and the rest of his clothes.
The chiefs came down to him, and without a word
they all walked off.
“ ‘Come Coster,’ I said, ‘ that finishes the pro-
gramme. I must get back in time to let them in.’
“‘And this,’ said Coster, recovered from his
fright now that the Maoris had gone, ‘is the
mumbo-jumbo nonsense that is to keep a man out
of his bed ar’ter midnight—an’ in a Christian
country, too. An’ a gen’leman like you counten-
ances such goings on. I'm disapp’inted.’
“And no doubt he was. I left him without
giving him a further tip—that was what he was
looking out for—and got back in time to open the
front door for the king, just as if nothing had
happened. The old boy nearly shook my hand off.
“I said, ‘You’ve had a good time?’ but he
wouldn’t speak. I offered him some supper, but
he shook his head. I took him up to his bedroom,
but he wouldn’t sleep in anything half so comfort-
able. . , . ...
“ He went down into the smoking-room with
never a word, pushed the table into a corner, and
motioned me to go away. Evidently, if he spoke
he would break the spell.
“ Next morning, Euphemia got up at half-past
six, as usual. One of the first things she did was
FROM THE BURNING.
“CAPTAIN" JOHNSING: “Yes, comrades, if it 'adn’t been for the dear
Harmy, I might ’a’ bin at the Tivoli Theatre prancin’ about the
styge makin ’ a hexibition o’ meself!”
to go into the smoking-room to let out the fumes
of the previous night’s tobacco. The room was
dark, but she made her way to the French win-
dow without accident, and opened it wide. In
rushed the cool air, as she stood contemplating
the morning. Then she turned to go into the
kitchen for her morning cup of tea.
“She’d got into the middle of the smoking-
room, when she saw under the table something
which made her pause. The king, naked but for
the table-cloth round his middle, was kneeling on
the floor beneath the table, from under which he
poked his diabolical, tattooed face. The girl gave
a sharp cry, and stood, trembling. The king got
up, and said —in his own lingo —that he felt much
better, and that he was quite cured, thanks to her
and me and everyone in the house. He laid a
kindly hand on her arm.
“She screamed with all her might, and bolted
from the room.
“Hearing the noise, I hurried downstairs,• and
found Euphemia fainting on the bottom-step.
“ When I went to the king he was sitting on
the top of the ta,ble, chuckling to himself as he
sorted out hiapakeha clothes. He was quite cured,
he said, and would always thank me for showing
him a suitable place where he could set up his
tuaahu and perform his rites. The ngerengere was
all gone.
“ But the servants took it in bad part. They
voted the whole business disreputable. ‘ We’re
accustomed to live respectable,’ said the cook,
‘and not along of black persons that walk about
naked, and sleep naked under the tables. You
may call -such folks kings, you may call ’em the
Emperor of Chiny, the Sultan of Turkey, or what
you likes— we call ’em ’eathen savages / ’
“Euphemia was indignation personified. ‘I
never come here to be laid hands on,’ she said.
‘ When I do forget myself I ’ope it won’t be with
such as ’ im. I should ’ope not. I didn’t take your
money to be drove into hysterics by savage < with
carved faces. You may be accustomed to such —
you come from where such goings-on is common.
I give a month’s warning.
“It was the end of our domestic comfort.
Never a girl would come' near us ; we lost caste in
the village, and a sort of social boycott set in.
But we had the consolation of knowing that the
king’s ngerengere was quite cured. I, personally,
had the satisfaction of having witnessed the only
occult Maori rite performed in England.”
Karepa was awake again, and sat, smoking.
“ All that tapu too much bother,” he said. “ I
take t’e tapu off all my picaninny. 1 take it off
all my taonga, cup, plate, knife, mat, ewerryt’ing.
I make it allasame as the pakeha. Too much t’e
tapu. Too much t’e karakia. The man wit’
t'e makutu no frighten me now—l aliassame as t’e
pakeha. ”
Henderson took out his flask, and offered me a
“ nip.”
“ Thanks,” I said, “but if we are going'to camp
here for the night, isn’t it time we pitched the
tent ? You, Karepa, being a man with no tapu
and no mana to speak of, may take the tomahawk
and cut some tent-poles.”
The Maori laughed.

Grundy’s Ghost.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE AUSTRALIAN'S LOVE OF HORSEFLESH.
LITTLE BILLY'S UNCLE: “ What would you like for a Christmas present, Billy?"
BILLY : “ I’d just like to ride that mare, uncle.” [And he did.]
Here is not the story of the ghost of
Private “ Grundy ” M’Carthy, H.M’s 22nd.
Hussars—but of the ghost that afflicted him. The
lessee of that malignant spook was Private
“ Tokey ” Williams, borne, when in the flesh, or
the muster-roll of the same corps. The 22nd.
were of the “Dumpy Pice,” the small, savage,
soldier-wasps of the “Honorable” East India
Company’s service. When a Briton in moleskins
violently filches shillings, Society scourges him
with many stripes. When a syndicate of shop •
keepers robs and murders with both hands,
territories and lacs of gold mohurs being the loot,
it is “Honorable.” Great was the raj of “John
Kompani ” !
After the Indian Mutiny, Victoria took over,
with other of the Company’s property, the
Company’s white troops, though these had no
covenant with her. Any refusing Imperial livery
were branded “ rebels ” and driven aboard floating .
cattle-pens for England, many being done to
death at sea in foetid ’tween-decks by putrid
rations, bilge-water, and fever. Thus ever British
Bumbledom guerdons the rank-and-file whose
blood cements the Empire’s glory.
* * * «
Grundy and Tokey were not Company’s soldiers.
They enlisted together, years before either Mutiny
or “ Tiger Act,” in H.M. 40th Light Dragoons,
long antecedent to the advent as Secretary of
State for War of the doctrinaire who invented
“limited engagement” and the “territorial”
aberration—in the days when the British Army
stocked veterans; when to the soldier his regiment
was home, his comrades brothers, his colonel God—
a grim deity to be followed, nathless, to nethermost
hell.
From the first day of their service, Grundy—
Irish, raw, and red, and Tokey—Welsh medical-
student of education, sagged from virtue—were
sworn comrades. Tradition associated them in
malign enterprise before enlisting. They went to
India together; together rode, blood to their
stirrup-irons, the Mutiny, and, the 40th ordered
home, volunteered to the Dumpies and for further
Indian service, and were later both invalided and
joined the depot troop, Canterbury (England).
OTHER TIMES, OTHER MANNERS.
BOLDEST BATHER : “Excuse me, ladies; but will you kindly
retire a little farther from our clothes? We have been
waiting for an hour for you to go away and let us dress.”
LADIES (all at once and together): “Oh, don’t mind i;s l We’re
New Women!"
Ihere Tokey’s ghost became objectionable. Prior
transactions in India however, belong first to this
record.
* * * *
After the amalgamation, the 22nd, quartered at
Allahabad, lost its regimental treasure-chest
containing Its.3ooo—then worth all £3OO. Thi
chest was inside a padlocked tumbril, the tumbril
outside the main-guard. The chest, safe at sun-
down, had vanished when the paymaster unlocked
the tumbril next morning. The entire guard were
whipped on the shelf.” Yet the mystery held,
enough the adjutant, young and melodramatic,
tor weeks crawled cantonments at night, like the
serpent after the fall, on his belly, a loaded revol-
ver m his sword-belt. Bandicoots and jackals he
encountered, and nearly sampled the venom of
variegated snakes and scorpions, but found never
thief nor rupee. The Provost-Sergeant’s men were
as unsuccessful, though they long shadowed every
Dumpy on orderly-room black-list. Tokey and
Grundy, both on the Provost’s staff, much distin-
guished themselves by zeal and ingenious theories.
Therefore, when, months after, they put in for
five weeks’ leave of absence “ to visit Benares and
adjacent parts,” the grateful adjutant backed, and
the colonel signed, their furloughs.
“Listen, Grundy, you crimson, Irish, bog-
trotting Papist, you; this will be a general field-day
of a spree, a screeching, scorching tear that you’ll
remember when back at your native bog picking
the spuds out of the ashes with your toe-nails.
But we don’t blew all that three thousand now.
I’ll buy gold with fifteen hundred of it; you plant
the rest till we get another furlough next year. 5 ’
So Grundy nested Rs. 1500 in a new place,
while Tokey, going among the city baboos, bought
gold—mohurs and sovereigns—here and there a
few. Then they took furlough. Legends of that
lurid jamboree long lingered in Bengal. Benares
they visited, but mostly “adjacent parts,” where
were no inquisitive white troops ; “goinglarge” in
many lal bazars ; heard of in dak bungalows with
female companions of divers races. On foot they
journeyed never, “ Grabbies ”or “ toe-soldiers ”
might “mud-crush,” but not “gentlemen-hus-
sars ” with red gold belted around their waists.
They were borne, rajah-wise, in palanquins, or
tore through the night in tongas, and always the
spur-clad boots of men and the necks of bottles
protruded from their chariots, and the scent of
aralc perfumed an unfragrant land. Evading in-
fantry pickets and the “ frogs’-inarch,” they duly
reported at the guard-room of the 22nd, and, re-
invigorated, returned to duty, every pie of Rs.
1500 royally “ blewed.”
* » * *
The torrid months came and dragged. The
comrades relieved monotony by circumspect
minor debaucheries, leaving intact their nest-egg.
Tokey provided funds—how, not even Grundy
quite knew. Queer robberies in city and canton-
ments happened those days. The city jewellers
jabbered of a strange native,
swarthy yet Fering hi-faced,
who bought old gold coins
and ornaments, and carried
a white umbrella, which he
hooked on foot of the
sloping board whereon the
dealer, sitting at head there-
of, scattered his wares for
inspection. Treasure and
the stranger vanished simul-
taneously. The bazar pun-
dits concluded the stranger
was a white budmasli who
palmed valuables into his
accursed sun-shade. Then,
did not Sergeant “Kicker”
Kavanagh, who disciplined
his Dumpies, when they
were phenomenally crapu-
lous and pugnacious, with
his boots, lose the bag of
rupees he had acquired by
lavish blending of water
with Commissariat rum,
while canteen sergeant.
Tokey carried the rupees
over to Kavanagh’s bunga-
low for him, and the latter,
throwing them into his box,
affixed thereto a Chubb’s
padlock. “ Let the blashted
tumbril thieves pick that
lock, if they can ; an’, by
the howly, if I catch them
trym’, I’ll brain ’em wid
me collar-chain, so I will! ”
Kicker was a big, strong
man, of vicious temper;
nevertheless, there were no
rupees in the box when, next
morning, the trumpets
jrayed the reveille. There was
an inch-thick grease-track from
cot to door, and a box, with the
bottom cut out and a greasy rope
fast to the handle, in the veran-
dah. The adjutant was hideously
disconcerted. But Tokey showed
that only a naked nigger could
possibly have crawled in and
lubricated floor and box un-
heard, or have had the patience
to drag the latter, inch by inch,
to the door without awakening
the sergeant. Life thereafter was
made unpleasant to strange
natives visiting cantonments —
even for those money-changers
who came to report they had
been despoiled by a sahib, habited
as a baboo, and with a white um-
brella. Provosts and promiscuous
barrack-room dogs hunted these
before they could attain the ear
of higher authority.
» * »
A year passed. Tokey and
Grundy sat in the provost-cell
wherein they bivouacked when
on provost duty. Time ripened
for another gorgeous furlough.
“Go fetch those fifteen hun-
dred rupees, Grundy, and shove
them in your box, till I can get
gold for them, and we’ll put in
for another furlough.”
Grundy departed, returning
speedily exuding perturbation.
“ Howly saints! ut’s gone, every
anna av ut! ”
Tokey, blanching under his
tan, yet, from glittering, un-
canny eyes, shot the Irishman a
searching glance ; then gnawed his
wiry moustache: “Let’s go look !”
They followed the inside of
the prickly-pear hedge, walling
the twelve cells, to a hut, where
were tools for digging graves.
Tokey lit a lantern hanging unere;
first swiftly touching the wick and
top of the lamp. Both were
dead-cold. As the light streamed
out the men heard the hiss an
angry cobra and saw the evil thing erect,
swaying with expanded hood in the very hole, at
toot of the wall facing the door, in which the trea-
sure had been hidden.
Grundy slid outside. Tokey, his own snakelike
ayes fastened on the cobra, reached swiftly for a
oamboo, and, as the reptile struck, met it with
iu ( r ( n b e r two sword-cut and broke its back.
Come here, you quaking Connemara coward ! ”
he fiercely whispered. “Didn’t you see that
thing when you were here just now ? ”
, see I saw ! The hole was dug up
an th roopays gone ; wasn’t that enough for wan
while?”
“You lit the lantern ? ”
HER BEAUTY AND THE BEASTS.
THE LAD: “That’s the Chow that Kite
O’Hara’s married to.”
HIS BIT O' SKIRT: “ Yus. What I can’t make out is
how any girl can take up with ugly beggars like them.”
The Irishman boggled a moment. “An* how
else wud I’ve seen the hole ? ”
“To hell with the hole ! When did you last
see the money ? ”
“When, is ut? Sure, last night; didn’t I lift
ut and put ut back and tramp the ground shmooth,
so I did ! ”.
“Fist the light! ”
Tokey went gingerly to the hole, his bamboo
ready to strike. In it were young cobras, writh-
ing and wicked. He killed them. Then he Mew
his comrade had lied and had himself taken the
money. But the Welshman made no sign.
* * * *
Weeks after, Tokey, calling Grundy at mid-
night to relieve him on bazar duty, said ; “Have
you seen these nights one of our chaps prowling
about cantonments, as if searching for some-
thing? ”
Grundy’s face twitched, and he shook. “ Nivir
won ; why ? ”
“Some fellow’s sniffing around; but he’s too
smart for me and gets away.”
Grundy, gripping his stick, went out. Tokey,
grinning, lay on his charpoy, and, seemingly,
fell asleep. Soon a shadow crept athwart the
floor—Grundy watching the sleeper. Satisfied, he
strode to the chapel-compound, paced, counting
his steps, the long cactus hedge, halted, hesitated,
stooped, lifted a stone, examined a bulky parcel
beneath, replaced the stone, raked leaves above it,
and departed—chuckling.
He might not have chuckled had he known he
was shadowed by one carrying a keen knife in his
cummerbund ; he might have been less merry had
he seen his tracker prone on his belly, a few yards
away on the other side of the hedge ; murder
might have been, had he returned while the
shadower took up and removed the treasure.
Grundy strolled leisurely back to the cells.
There Tokey snored harder than before, and
Grundy chuckled once more at the humor of the
situation.
* . * • •
Next day a European soldier deposited Rs. 1500
in the local bank.
“ Prize-money ?” said the accountant, with the
genial smile and languid curiosity of one who
receives.
‘‘ Sweat-money ! My savings after seventeen
years of this God forsaken country.”
* * * •
So, when they were old—for 24 years of guard-
bed and variegated alcohol age the cavalryman
before five-and-forty—these two came to Canter-
bury depot, to dodge-in their small remaining
service. Recruits grinned at their middle-aged
attachment and grim old-soldier ways. But un-
ostentatiously ; as the comrades argued with
collar-chains or horse-logs. They guarded one
another’s barrack-room interests with aggressive
vigilance ; were inseparable, and nightly —bril-
liantly burnished, chrome-yellowed, and pipe-
clayed—clanked and swaggered out of barracks,
as horsemen go arrayed for love; Tokey,
a lean, weather-beaten and grizzled war-wolf;
Grundy, a pink-complexioned, red-headed, and
well-oiled dandy. Neither affected female so-
ciety. Both had realised alike the falsity of
woman, and the eternal verity of malt and hops.
Yet they met their fate, and their fate was—a
woman.
* * * *
Avoiding the grog-shops of a garrison town,
they sought, in country lanes, slow, old-fashioned
inns, in the low-pitched rooms of which scents of
lavender and musk mingled with coarser odours of
casks, and clustering roses, red and white, rapped
gently at the diamond window-panes. There they
refreshed, far from the guffaws of raucous re-
cruits and the giggling of girls enticed from rural
homes and the monotony of chastity by the irre-
sistible lures of jingling spurs, of shining steel and
scarlet.
* * * *
Such a serai they happened-on one moonlit
summer night. Roses bloomed over the low
porchway and climbed the creaking sign—a
Headless Horseman ; great hollyhocks and giant
sunflowers waved languorous in the garden ; the
air was heavy with perfume of jasmine and stocks.
Under the porch a girl, her head uncovered, stood
a’ tip-toe trying to reach the shining glow-worms
in a flower-box hung high. Tokey passed in.
Irish gallantry forbade Grundy leave woman in
distress.
“ Let me help ye, miss,” and waiting no leave—
as is the right way with women—he lightly swung
her up by the waist, then let her gently down and
saluted.
She laughed, the glow-worms shining in her
pink palm ; then came without the porch, so that
the moonlight glanced upon face and form of
such a woman as, since the world was, has had
power to bind the wills of men—a light, lithe,
almost fragile, but full-throated girl, with dark,
melancholy-gay eyes of shifting color, and coils of
brown hair shot with sunbeams. Her dress was a
spotless print ; sweet flowers and a snatch of soft
lace at her shapely breast—rustic she, yet all frag-
rant and delicious ; her speech and manner free
alike from gawkiness of rural Kent and mincings
of the modem board-school miss.
A white-haired dame, soft of voice, showed
them to a parlor and brought them drink. Tokey,
unbuttoning his stable-jacket, took a long pull at
s l ean; big back luxuriously,
“ Lady-killing, eh ; you dashed old fool ?”
“By th’ powers ! Tokey, but did ye see th’ two
eyes av her ? ”
“ i’ ve looked in the eyes of many women, white
and yellow, and never got good from the looking
yet The eyes of a woman ! My God, what
might I not have been now, but for the eves of a
woman ! ”
Nevertheless, when, later, the girl came, laugh-
ing, with a rose for Grundy’s jacket, Tokey looked
into her eyes and—his doom !
She sat carelessly on the arm of a big old chair
showing her pretty feet and ankles, and made
them tell her of the army, of the Mutiny—their
own story. Tokey was spokesman, and, under
the spell of the girl’s glances, the manner and lan-
guage of an earlier day came back to him. Grundy
Sa m. llttle ’ devourin & the woman with his eyes.
Then she told them of herself. She had been
in London, “in business with a friend,” but, fall-
ing delicate, had come back to be nursed by her
mother, who kept the “Headless Horseman”
Her name was May. And, when they were going
she made them promise to come again, well know-
ing they would come.
* * * «
Nightly they made love to her, each his own ’
way. Then fell a time when Grundy, horse-
kicked, went to hospital. Tokey faithfully tended
Ins comrade, smuggling in to him rum, tobacco,
and other delicacies. After, he rewarded himself
at the shrine of love. His wooing of Mav was
fierce—the courting of a fighting Celt.
« a ? n XH, the & irl absent, the mother said:
An what d ye come after my girl for, Mr Wil-
liams—to get her love and leave her, like all ye
ww r "o entlemen do , es ? May’s an innocent child.
What d ye want with her ? ”
“To marry her, mother.”
®*}S > u fu ed q f uietl , y - “ No offence; but how
would the likes of ye keep a wife ? May puts her
arms in a wash-tub to keep no man ”
h“*^du nkW “ sl ‘ ow ' d “ ore


. “ Tve that; and when I’m discharged, my pen-
sion for service and wounds—not much, yet some-
i’ve prize-money—all £2oo—coming.”
1 Jus intelligent old woman, not indisposed to
nouse her “innocent girl,” was impressed. Maybe
she made enquiries. Anyway, when next he
called, May was in melting mood,
ri ll l ? aarr y you,” she said, “whenever you
ike. That poor Mr. M ‘Carthy, now; has he no
money banked ? ”
iokey laughed sardonically. “Devil apie l
lie may have prize-money—some day.”
* * * *
The evening of the day Grundy was discharged
from hospital he (Tokey being on “fatigue”)
swaggered, alone and radiant, to the inn.
Mays out,” said her mother; “it’s no use
•' ou coming here. She’s going to marry respect-
“ple, to Mr. Williams, who saved £2OO in India.
May s not for you, Mr. M‘Carthy ! ”
He stood awhile, his mouth open ; then, com-
prehending, purpled with passion and held, shak-
ing, to a chair. Two hundred pounds ! —he knew
where that came from ; saw, as in a dream, white,
ant-scoured Allahabad, a long cactus hedge, an
empty hole, and felt the agony a rogue feels at
encountering a superior rascal. He said little,
incoherently cursed his comrade and the girl, and
staggered into the night.
The old lady laughed softly.
Before “last post ” he stalked into the barrack-
room.
“Come and drink, you pink-snouted bog-
trotter ! ” sang out Tokey, his normal irascibility
mellowed by beer, and pointing to a pot on the
table.
The other answered nothing. He went straight
to his shelf, took thence an uncut loaf (his and
Tokey’s ration of bread for following day) and
halved it with exactness. One moiety he threw
°n tl,e shelf, the other he left on the table.
“ Th’ curse av Judas an’ ye, ye Welsh bastard,
an’ an the Gov’mint as sarves out no ball-ammuni-
tion to this dam depot, so’s I might shoot ye dead
to wonst ! ”
There was dead silence in the wondering room.
The act of “cutting the loaf,” solemn as a sacra-
ment, meant final severance of comradeship. The
room, loving neither man, was yet honestly
affected. The British soldier of that day knew
nothing so sacred as comradeship. Loudly and
malignantly laughed Tokey.
* • • •
Henceforward neither spoke to the other.
Tokey nightly went courting. The recruits in the
room were ready enough to annoy the former com-
rades, in detail, but when the boldest once abused
Tokey in the latter’s absence, Grundy promptly
stretched him across his cot with a broken nose.
“ Lie still, ye pariah, till ye knows how to spake
respectful of your shupariors ! ”
Some weeks after the breach the two received
their prize-money. Three days later Tokey mar-
ried “without leave.” His wedding-present to
his bride was £4OO. She banked it the same day;
was taken “ suddenly ill,” and borne home by her
mother. Thus was Tokey’s honeymoon deferred,
and he repaii ed to his solitary martial cot. The
wedding had been kept quite quiet; if Grundy
knew, he gave no sign. Time went, but the bride
continued, her mother said, “dangerously ill.”
In six weeks Tokey was only permitted to see the
girl twice for a few minutes.
He began to age strangely, to pine and sicken.
He mooned drearily about barracks, cr lay speech-
less on his cot. Daily he grew more gaunt; some
unsightly cutaneous disorder attacked him ; the
room humorist opined he was “a bloomin’ old ruin
crumblin’ to bits.” But Grundy gathered liveli-
ness. He went out every evening that Tokey
remained in barracks. It was whispered he had
been seen much with “a square girl—her mother
keeps a country pub.” Grundy always returned
mentally elevated but painfully sober. He, on
these occasions, had a trick of looking at Tokey—
they still slept in adjacent cots —and of guffawing
in a manner which exasperated the wild-eyed
veteran to the verge of madness. But neither
spoke. The room waited an explosion.
* * * O'
For many days Tokey nad not quitted barracks
—even to enquire after his wife. What he had
seen, heard, or suspected was never known. But
all saw he was dying as he walked. One night
Grundy, just before “watch-setting, ’’ swaggered
noisily into the room. Undressing, he banged his
boots, spurs, and whip down, whistled, sang un-
melodiously, and stridently laughed whenever he
glanced in Tokey’s direction. The latter lay still
on his cot, only his eyes, alive and alight, showing
above his blankets. Grundy, hanging up his
jacket, so managed that the buttoned sleeve flipped
Tokey in the face.
BULLETIN ARTIST'S SON (in church for first
time, pointing up to stained glass window):
“ Where’s the joke, Dad? ”
Then the latter started up, pouring out a stream
of black curses which made even the hardened
room shudder. He wound up: “Listen, you
sneaking hound, that tried to rob your own com-
rade, and hadn’t the savee to know how. I fol-
lowed you that night down the prickly-pear hedge,
and I’ve been sorry ever since 1 didn’t stick you,
for the Irish pig you are. But I’ve got the
money, and, ha ! ha ! I’ve got the girl ! ”
The other listened, half-hypnotised, not by the
words, but by the concentrated venom and malig-
nity of the other, and by his terrible eyes. But,
when Tokey ceased, Grundy burst into a wild
laugh.
“Hev ye that same? Hev ye? Ye lie; the
1 as the money and—howl and ramp, ye mur-
derin’ devil ! —Fve got the gal; when I like,
when I like.”
Then, half mad with liquor and revenge, he
tore Tokey’s pouch-belt from its peg and
dashed it in the owner’s face. The sharp
brass tip deeply gashed the old soldier’s
forehead. Only a few drops of black blood
oozed from the wound.
“ Take that, ye black-hearted Welsh divil ;
I’d give ye more, but ye’ll be dead in a
week ! ”
Tokey lay still. His face was grey and set.
When he spoke, he spoke quietly, without
heat : “ Yes, I’ll be dead in a week. And
take notice, you men ; witness for me ; when
I’m dead, if there’s a God in Heaven, or a
devil in Hell, I’ll return that foul blow, and
I’ll come and sit on that thing’s chest till it
dies of fright ! ” He turned his face to the
wall ; the doleful trumpet wailed —“Lights
out ' "
- .iey carried Tokey to hospital next morn-
ing. That night Grundy took the news to
the “Headless Horseman,” and was received
by May (well and blooming—she had never
been ill) and her placid mother with effusion.
He left the former some £2OO richer ; they
were to be married immediately Tokey’s death
left the innocent child free. Six nights later
the orderly-sergeant came into the room at
roll-call.
“Which of you’s next for fatigue?” He
looked at his duty-roster. “ Lewis, you go to
hospital to sit up with Private Williams ! ”
“Tokey bad, sergeant?” asked the room-
corporal.
“Doctor says he can’t live a week; smart
old soldier in his day, Tokey. Answer to
your names, you chaps.”
Grundy came in before “last post ’’—sober
and apparently depressed. The room said
nothing to him, but grinned cavernously.
* * * *
“Lights out !” sounded. The stillness of
night fell, broken only by kick of unquiet
horse, the passionate whinny of mare in the
stable below, or the melancholy monotone of
the hoarse sentry—“ Number three —and all’s
'veil ! ”
» • * *
The room never could explain why, about 2
a.m., every man woke, coldly sweating; each
fancying he alone was awake and eacli ashamed
to call-out. When the corporal, quaking, tried
to strike a match, there arose an awful and piercing
shriek, with the rattle and jingle as of belts and
arms throv.n down. A cold air stole through the
close and stable-scented room, and with the gleam
of the corporal’s candle arose a babble of ex--
clamation.
“ What the devil was that ? ”
The corporal leapt from his cot. “ Stop him !
Stop him ! ” he yelled to the man lying next the
room door.
But a figure in hospital dress, a figure seen by
all the room and by the sentry on No. 3 post (no
recruit can be trusted to stay his two hours on
that post in Canterbury barracks, even to this
day, though this true story has long been forgotten)
vanished, though there was neither opening nor
closing of the room door.
Grundy lay white and still, Tokey’s pouch-belt
across his breast; on his brow a broad gash trick-
ling blood. It was Grundy who had shrieked.
Now he lay insensible, his open eyes staring into
space. They dashed water over him and he
seemed to revive, but spoke never a word. In his
eyes was the terror of death and hell.
An hour after, just when the room had recovered
sufficiently to pretend to laugh, the door was
suddenly opened. The men, their nerves fretted
like worn fiddle-strings, almost yelled.
It was only Lewis, however, returning from
hospital-fatigue.
“Hello, you chaps, what’s up? Poor old
Tokey’s dead, died an hour ago. Died hard, my
oath ! He jumped up in his cot, howled, laughed,
made as if to snatch something from a peg, threw
his hand out, shrieked, ‘ Here I am, Grundy ! ’
and fell back, grinning, but dead as a ’orse-log.
Orderly and me finished Tokey’s medical comforts;
and—l’m not for morning stables, corporal; mind
that! ”
* • * *
When the principal military medical officer saw
Grundy’s dead body next morning, he was puzzled.
“ Heart, I suppose ; though I should say he died
of nightmare.” He lifted a heavy eyelid with his
strong white fingers. “Whew! Look at the
horror in that eye ! ”

TO LAURA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If winter snows are falling
On you, my only love,
They fall as soft as twilight,
Or cooing note of dove.
The newer years are swelling
The music of the old,
No tale of discord telling.
Life’s fires refine Love’s gold.
I sing no song of Winter :
The garden whence 1 glean
Hath flowers, an l scents of Summer,
And melody, rny Queen.

You do not dull your lustre
Nor lose your early art;
You have the richer sweetness
The ripening years impart;
The same old lights come playm
Like sunbeams in your eyes,
My little griefs allaying—
You know where my heart lie
nd still your hand hath cunning
To strike a chord that thrills;
It is a goodly garden
That love, my Laura, tills.
There have been tearful partings.
And changes not a few :
One flower was plucked in Spring-time,
All wet with morning dew;
There has been winter weather;
There have been summer joys;
But still, we are together,
Not Time nor Season cloys;
t he years that have been garnered
Are fair, as you are fair,
All pearls, that make a chaplet
For you, my Queen, to wear.
The voices of the old-time
Come whispering in the win ,
'There is one strain of sadness,
One gone we left behind.
The Wine of Life is sweeter
When old, to you and me;
The stream of Love runs deeper
The nearer to the Sea.
A nd still we are together;
The winter snows may fall—
You shall be still, my Laura ;
Keep what I gave you—All.
ANDREW SARD.
Johnson.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Johnson and his mate came to the cattle-station
“per boot,” and camped beside the garden.
J ohnson led a dissolute life when he could. His
mate did worse ; he played the concertina, the
strains whereof nightly attracted Ah Sam, who,
leaning over the garden-fence, applauded vigor-
ously.
After two days the mate went away. “It
ain’t a caper of mine, smooging to a Chow for
tucker, ” he said.
Johnson stayed, and his acquaintance with Ah
Sam ripened into friendship. He listened sympa-
thetically while the latter poured forth his horti-
cultural troubles. He made mental notes while
fche unsuspecting Chow just sweated out informa-
tion—uncommon, though “garden.”
Armed with this stock of new ideas, Johnson
again asked the boss for work.
“You see, it’s this way,” said he, “I’m a gar-
dener by trade, and that yellow agony down there
is just ruining that garden. I don’t want to jump
another man’s job, but I’ve a wife and kids to
support.”
Johnson was a fluent liar, and the boss just
hated Chinamen. “ Tell Ah Sam to come up, and
you can start work to-morrow.”
A Chinaman does not fly into a rage ; he works
himself up. So when Ah Sam returned with his
cheque, he at first merely paused near Johnson’s
camp to say, “You welly sinar’ man, Misser
Johnson,” and passed on. He stopped at a let-
tuce-plat to add, “My wo’d ! Plen’y you logue !
Blully new-chum, I t’ink.” Then, gathering fire
and inspiration from some ravishing cabbagee, he
came back flaming. “Hi ! You blully new-
chum ! You come heah. Me give’m you tucka.
You take’rn my job ! Hi ! See ! You take’m
my hat ! Come on ! You take’m my coat ! You
take’m my tlousel, too ! You t’ink me no savee
fi’? Come on, you blully lascal—me fi’ you all
li! ”
“ Oh ! give it a rest,” said Johnson.
• * * *
Years after, in Plumton, the two again met.
Ah Sam owned a garden. Johnson owned a wife,
temporarily ; or, rather, the woman owned him.
The garden and a lucrative opium-trade with
the blacks kept Ah Sam in affluence. The
buxom wife, young, but with a varied experience
of husbands, mainly kept Johnson—kept him in
order, too. Ruled him with a rod of iron if a
stick wasn’t handy.
Johnson was the town nondescript. But there
was one thing on which he could always rely,
when times were bad—an unfailing supply of
vegetables.
Ah Sam was the most forgiving of men. He
beamed unctuously on Johnson ; would occasion-
ally bring the daily cabbage—when Johnson was
out.
A race-meeting down the river took Johnson
out of town for a few days. On his return the
news was “ broken ” to him by Ebenezer, the bell-
man “ I say, Johnson—your old woman’s given
you brusher, and gone down to Ah Sam’s.”
The devil she has!” Johnson answered,
languidly. Them Chows has a great fancy for
big women.” J
“Hum !” said Ebenezer, “you take it prettv
cool If it was my old woman, I’d break that
heathen’s skull for him.”
“There’s no need for me to do anything of that
sort, said Johnson, reminiscently feelin" his
head. “ She’s about big and willin’ enough to do
hat herself. Seems to me,” lie added, reflec-
tiveiy L was born to bring misfortune on that
there Chinaman !

Jealousy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Flies buzzed, heat wavered in the air, glare beat
furiously through the window, and Maloney’s goat
was on the verandah again. The C.P.S. seized
the first thing handy, which happened to be the
cash-book, and hurled it at the friendly creature.
The volume fell unerringly into the bucket by the
tank. The goat, more in sorrow than in anger,
sought the Sergeant’s garden. It was doing nicely
on the last geranium and was passing on to the
Sergeant’s pants when Mrs. Murphy’s eye rested
upon it. Falling over a kopje of flower-pots she
broke the broom with one magnificent stroke
against the fence and rose with her mouth full of
grief and soil. The goat wandered into the house,
trod on the baby, and escaped by the back-door.
The C.P.S. recovered the Govt, property, and
spread it tenderly in the sun to dry. He felt
miserable and unstrung. It was more than a
month since a pink monkey had chased a blue ser-
pent over the ceiling, ora purple centipede stepped
out of the ink-bottle and addressed him by his
Christian name. He had not even been drunk for
a week. Why was the P.M. so diffident in start-
ing? Turn about-turn about. That had been
the arrangement. The C.P.S. felt keenly on the
matter. Was it Christian ?
The P.M.’s head, like an immense billiard-
ball, shone above the awful solemnity of the
Bench. Around it buzzed an excited army of
flies. Each tapped gently on the elderly legal
cranium. Then, terrified by the hollow sound,
whole contingents fled into his eye.
The harmless drunk, awaiting acquittal, suddenly
found himself fined £l, and was removed by Ser-
geant Murphy in a dazed condition. All the way
to the watch-house he was longing for sympathy,
but he received nothing but a heavy punch in the
stomach when Mrs. Murphy missed the goat.
The P. M. remained for a few minutes in splen-
did isolation on the bench, saying “ Damn ! ”
Then he rose. The Court and the day’s work
were over.
The P. M. sauntered into the clerk’s room with
a pompous air.
“ Plenty of work, Jinks ? ” he said, jauntily.
“Pounds of it,” retorted Jinks, shoving the
cash-book out of sight.
“Nothing like it ” said the P.M. loftily. They
fell to talking dog and horse.
Presently the P.M. said :—“ I may not be down
to-morrow, Jinks. I doubt if there will be any-
thing doing. In any case you can sit for me.”
That sounded like business. The C.P.S.
beamed.
“ Certainly, certainly,” he said, with a smile of
intense benevolence. “ Only too glad, I’m shuah.”
The P.M. cocked his hat and left with a
military swagger, slapping his leg with his cane.
The C.P.S. watched him behind the window.
“Straight for Maloney’s parlor—straight as a
bolt,” he chuckled, rubbing his hands. “He
meets Cherry, the banker. Good, they turn
simultaneously in the same direction. They are
accosted by Phipps—Aha !He also turns. They

are joined by Smithers —Oh, excellent! Four days!
Four days ! ”
Later that night the P.M. was found hatless,
curled up on a vacant allotment. He was picked
up by the Sergeant and wheeled home in Morri-
son’s wheelbarrow. The Sergeant tried to find his
hat. Maloney’s goat watched him with a guilty
smile. -
The C.P.S. heard of it next morning and
beamed. Business was conducted with cheerful-
ness and despatch.
Three drunks were
cautioned and dis-
charged. An as-
sault case was let
off with a small
fine.
On the second day
the P.M. fought a
shearer’s cook from
Bonnington and
got a black eye and
three teeth knock-
ed down his throat.
On the third day
he took part in
a steeplechase in
the main street,
and won it. The
Sub - inspector of
Police would have
been first if he had
not fallen into the
pile of kerosene-
tins opposite the
Church of England.
On the fourth day
Cherry, the banker,
and the P.M. went
out fishing and fell
into the creek. They
were rescued with
grappling-irons, and
spent the evening
drinking rum with two car-
riers and a swaggie.
The Sergeant reported
everything faithfully to
the C.P.S., who worked
harder than ever. All
the P.M.’s correspond -
ence and books were up
to date.
“It is perfect, per-
fect,” exclaimed the
C.P.S. to himself.
“And, to finish-up
with, a nice swim
in the creek, just
to straighten him.
He will come
back to-morrow
chastened yet re-
freshed in spirit,
and take up his
work feeling a new man.
He shall find everything
up to date—everything,”
muttered the
C.P.S. writing
out a summons
like a madman.
A happy C. P.S.
came to the
Courthouse at 0
a.m. next day—
but no P.M. At
11.30 the Sergeant
reported that the
P.M., Cherry the banker, and the Sub-Inspector
of Police were riding up the street. It was—
alas !—too true. They were going out to in-
spect a lode on the Dugo—the trooper with the
pack-horses had been sent on before. The C.P.S.
frowned as he sat on the bench.
The two carriers and the swaggie were fined
10s. 6d. each and severely cautioned. The face of
Justice all that morning wore a terrible aspect, and
the atmosphere was full of fines and damages. At
12 the Court rose and despatched the Sergeant to
report. He returned in a quarter of an hour with
the information that Johnson, of Bildango, and
his brother, had just come in, and things were
looking-up at Maloney’s. The C.P.S. set his
teeth, but kept his head.
At quarter to 4 the Sergeant arrived with the
information that the expedition had not yet got
clear of the main-street, and that the whole town
was lost in an atmosphere of Squatter, Banker,
and P.M. Then a fearful light shone in the eyes
of the C.P.S. He rose with an exceeding great
cry, and, grasping his hat, fled the room.
The P.M. was in the midst of his best Irish
story, punctuated by hiccups, when the doorway
of Maloney’s parlor was suddenly darkened. The
P.M.’s jaw dropped, and he shifted his gaze
uneasily.
“Traitor!” said the terrible voice of the
C.P.S.
“Didn’t shay fourthsh daysh ” — hie —said the
P.M. “ Shaid — hie —fifth day.”
“ Liar! ” yelled the C.P.S., as he seized the
P.M.’s nose between his thumb and finger, and
tweaked it before the company.
The P.M. hurled a china-dog and a case of
stuffed birds at his head and followed up with the
parlor-clock and his fist. They fought fiercely
over the room, and ultimately, tangled-up in the
table - cloth,
descended in-
to the grate
amidstachaos
of table-legs
and bottles.
Nor was the
rage of the
C.P.S. even
then assuag-
ed. At 11
next morning
he might
have been ob-
served on

and in carting them home; only to find
them back again shortly afterwards. The Ser-
geant manned the bench with the only sober J.P.
m the town, and promptly locked him up after-
wards as a reserve force in case of need. Then
the Sergeant started in on his own. At 5
that evening the P.M., the C.P.S., and the
Sergeant lay in a confused heap of bankers,
storekeepers, and squatters on Shanahan’s veran-

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sleep ye lonely by the rivers, sleep ye lonely in
the ranges,
Where the weird bush voices whisper and the
night’s wind-anthem changes
To the singing of the wild birds and the music
and the calling ?
Do the shadow-voices call thee from a land the
wide seas over ?
Calling, oh, so softly calling, for the coming of the
rover—
For the one that never cometh are a woman’s
tears still falling ?
Do you fancy in your sleeping as the waving grass
caresses,
You can hear sweet women coming, hear the
rustle of their dresses,
Hear the soft tones of a mother —hear a glad girl
hail her lover ?
Oh, ye Sleepers of the Plains ! doth your lone
grave seem more lonely
When the ghostly moon is rising and your spirit
heareth only
The crying of the curlew and the piping of the
plover ?
Wiien the heated earth is cracking and the
Drought Queen’s hot breath hisses,
Calling to the Sun, her lover —does it bring to
thee her kisses ?
Ye who knew a woman’s scorning, ye who loved a
little while—
Do ye hear the words she uttered as she told you
how she loved you,
Do you see her standing queenly as an angel far
above you—
Do you hear her recantation —do you see her
mocking smile ?
Though the old folks sent you southward with
“God speed” for sailing-orders,
Though a woman sent you roaming to the Lost-
Lands’ farthest borders,
There ye sleep by creek and ranges, lost to old-
world love and hating,
And the Austral mother claims you as her first-
born and her dearest,
Ye who tasted her caresses —ye unto her heart are
nearest.
Ye were first to call her Mother —she was weary
with her waiting.
Waiting through the cold, dim ages, all her
beauties hid and folden,
Till ye came and saw her beauties, saw the wattle
blooming golden,
And she took ye to her bosom thrilling in her
expectation,
Took the hopeful and the hopeless, laughed in
pride to see your daring,
Watched you tread her silent bushways, saw your
lonely desert-faring,
Saw ye as the lone forerunners of her people—and
a nation.
Ye who were the old world’s failures, ye were
foremost in the sowing,
Hearts of lead and bitter spirits, all uncaring and
unknowing,
Took her love and braved her anger, flinging wide
the door of changes.
World-forgotten, she forgets not, she will guard
your place of sleeping
And the anthem of the nightwind is thy Austral
mother weeping
For the dying of the first-born by her rivers and
her ranges.

THE POET.
The Darling of the Year with sifted gold
Of sunshine makes the old earth young again;
Spring’s dancing music lilts in pulse and vein ,
And all the world is merry as of old :
But shadows only dwell within my brain ;
My heart is like a hearth with ashes cold.
0 Muse, if I have loved thee late and long,
If I have worshipped thee, and made a shrine
To hold thine image in this heart of mine,
And served thee with the service of my song,
And poured my years out at thy feet divine—
Where art thou now when ghosts around me
throng ?
Where is the pride, above the pride of kings,
That once I felt Avhen in the glowing air
I saw the shining wonder of thy hair,
And heard the rustle of thy radiant wings
Alas, and have I come by ways so fair
To dust and ashes and the end of things i
My soul is compassed round by phantoms vast,
Whose black wings slmt from me the sweet
blue sky
And blue broad sea I knew when thou wert nigh.
O Muse, return to me ! . . . She comes at last !
And I can now--, clear-voiced, like Agag, cry—-
Surely the bitterness of Death is past!
THE MUSE.
Thou wert my servant in the time gone by,
And through the world I led thee by the hand,
And showed thee all the beauty of the land,
And all the marvels of the Earth and Sky.
lliy nights and days I held at my command,
And unto thee I gave the Seeing Eye.
The sacred secret of the infinite
That burns beneath the beauty of the rose,
A.nd in the hearts of youth and maiden glows,
And fills and thrills the world with life and light,
And is the soul of all that breathes and grows—
made it visible unto thy sight.
But now another Muse holds thee in thrall.
Thou canst not serve us twain : that is the law.

AN OLD PHOTO
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
ISS LAURA, with a careless laugh,
Cried — “ What a funny photograph l
To think Papa, now grown so fat,
Was ever such a ‘sketch’ as that/”
Her mother for a moment smiled.
“ And what a meek and saintly face 1
Just like an angel saying grace—
A sort of Good Young Man who Died.”
The mother turned her head aside:
And answered, “Don’t talk nonsense, child!"
She’d kept the photo, hid away—
'Twas taken on their wedding-day—
And as she thought of then and now
She brushed her hand across her brow,
For truth is not to be denied;
Reluctantly the wife confcss’t
Her girl had spoken truth in jest.
The “old man” lives, so coarse, so changed,
And still her heart from his estranged
Clings to the “ Good Young Man who Died.”
EDMUND FISHER.
East Lynne on the Castlereagh.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Uncle Jim was kneeling on the hearth, giving
Bobbie a lesson in boxing, and from time to time
he ducked cleverly to show us all how to dodge a
“stinker.” Uncle has the dirtiest left on the
Castlereagh ; in fact, you can’t see it for dirt at
times. Little Bobbie danced across the hearth,
keeping his feet well in hand and his eye on
Uncle’s nose.
“I’d like Bob Fitzsimmons ter come up th’
river. Holy Peter! I’d back my chance; I’d
put th’ selection on myself.” Uncle feinted at
Bobbie carelessly, and Bobbie rushed in like a
young tornado, bringing his hard little right across
Uncle’s nose. Uncle Jim drop >ed his hands ; his
wrinkled face went red with fury. “ Yer a spite-
ful little crawler ! What did ye hit me like that
fer ? Couldn’t yer see I wasn’t lookin’ ? ”
Bobbie stood with his guard up, his small body
quivering with excitement. “I—l didn’t mean
ter hit yer father, but yer said I was ter hit-out.”
“Go ter bed,” thundered Uncle, “ Yer a spite-
ful little dog ! ”
Bobbie went to bed.
Aunt smiled sarcastically, but did not look up
from her ironing. In the silence that followed we
could hear the rain pelting on the leaves outside,
and the clitter, clitter of stones where the sluicing
torrents raced in the wheel-ruts past the verandah.
“ Moloney lost eight rams yisterday, an’ he’d a
lost eight more if Black Harry hadn’t swimmed
’em over the crick one at a time. Moloney gave
him tixapen for doin’ it.” Somebody spoke from
an obscure corner, but Uncle only rubbed his
nose.
“What a night for tramps and stockmen !”
sighed Aunt. “ Thank God ! no one’s out be-
longing to me.”
There was a sudden tap ! tap !at the door. We
all looked at each other. Uncle said, “Gawd’s
truth ! ”
Tap ! tap ! tap !
“Goto the door, Jim.” Aunt looked at him
sternly, but he remained rooted to his place.
“You coward ! ” she whispered ; “ I’ll go.”
She opened the door gently, and the inrushing
wind brought in the smell of wet cattle and trees,
“ Who are you ? What do you want ? ” Aunt
faced Something in the darkness, and the Some,
thing whispered feebly and put a thin hand inside
the door.
“ I’m Jim Sloan’s wife,” it said ; “ and I’ve come
back.”
Aunt made a sharp, outward movement with
her hands, and then she screwed up her mouth
and laughed hysterically. And the querulous
voice in the darkness broke in upon it like a wail:
I was married to Jim in Sydney years an’ years
ago. . . . I’ve walked miles. Let me in, for God’s
sake. ... I am Jim’s wife. He will know me.
He will. ...”
Uncle Jim remained on his knees; his livid jaws
gasped with an expressionless horror. He made a
lunatic gesture with his left hand. “ By—God—
that’s—Norah ! Holy Peter ! ”
Nobody stirred or lifted a hand until Aunt
mode a wild forward clutch and dragged the
Voice into the room. Then she did a strange
thing—locked the door and barred it. “ I’ve
heard something of this business,” she said,
quietly. “Now you hold your tongue?” She
made a fierce gesture at Uncle Jim. The Voice
stood in the centre of the room, a dripping em-
bodiment of Rags. The face was gipsy-dark and
the eyes glittered like knives through clotted,
rain-drenched hair. She rocked forward and her
lips smiled ; then she dripped, dripped.
Aunt stood off and beat her foot on the boards.
The children looked at Uncle Jim as though lie
had turned suddenly into a dingo. We had all
heard of the Woman who ran away, but everyone
had agreed that she died in America long ago.
None of us had read story-books, so the event was
terribly new and full of possibilities.
Every man exhibits some peculiar trait in his
hour of agony. Uncle Jim sparred at an imagin-
ary Bob Fitzsimmons.
“ I’m his wife,” said Rags ; “ I’m Norah Sloan.
I’m hungry, cold. May I look at the fire ? I’m
so cold ? ”
Aunt Sloan is an exceedingly sensible bush
woman ; she didn’t unbar the door that night oi
sit outside on the rail and scream. She simply
packed the kids to bed and slammed Uncle Jim
into the back room. Then she returned to Rags
and shook her severely by the shoulders. “So

you’ve come back from the dead to disturb me and
my children. What are you going to do ? ”
Rags prostrated herself on the hearth.
“Don’t send me out to-night.”
Aunt laughed bitterly. “ Send you out, to hear
of you scandalising me all over the country. No,
I’ll keep you, d’ye hear? I’ll make you work.”
Aunt kicked the fire into leaping tongues of light.
Then she did another furious thing—took out a
tin of oatmeal, threw it into a billy with some
milk, and stirred it over the flames. Rags
stretched out her hand to the fire, and the white
blaze from the myall log illumined her with a
ghostly brilliance. “I’ve walked from Dubbo,”
she whispered. “I thought I’d never find the
place. . . . Brannigan’s Siding, isn’t it?” She
took in Aunt with the shift of an eye, and sighed
wearily.
“ You are Jim’s wife? The children are yours ;
but there is one . . . mine : you will not deny
that ? ”
Aunt whitened to her temples. “Don’t speak
to me of your child, you—runaway! ”
The gipsy face and knife-like eyes looked up
from the fire. “Don’t deny him to me, Emily.
You have your own ; aren’t they enough ? ”
i Aunt crouched over her with clenched hands.
“If I were a churchwoman I’d drive you and
your brat from under my roof to-night; but I’m
not. So . . . you will stay and work —ay, I will
see that you work.”
Suddenly a small voice rose from behind the
thin partition: “Mother, mother; tell father I
didn’t mean to hit him so hard. ... I didn’t
mean ter.”
Rags locked her hands together, her face turned
slowly towards the sound of Bobbie’s voice.
“ Will you, Emily . . . let me go in ? . . . He
will not see me in the dark. ”
Aunt stirred the oatmeal scornfully, without
looking at her visitor. Then, with sudden anger,
she said, “ You will sleep in this corner to-night—
after you have eaten —and, if you attempt to see
that child, I’ll——.” Aunt stood on her toes and
choked an imaginary Rags.
“I can wait,” said the visitor, over her shut
hands ; “I can wait.”

A little rest and food made a startling differ-
ence in Norah Sloan’s appearance. Her dark
gix»y face became a matter of surpassing interest
THE HEATHEN IN HIS BLINDNESS.
“ I fear,” said the new shepherd, sweetly smilinj, “I fear that your father, the chieftain, does

the middle distance pensively cracking a cocoanut.)
to the cookies and flash boundary - riders who
sometimes dropped in for a cup of Aunt’s tea.
But Norah would sit at table
with head bent, and eyes star-
ing vacantly at the handful of
violets in her waistband.
Uncle Jim’s position was
hard to define.
He became absent-minded,
and never took his gaze off the
shingles. One night by chance
his eye met Norah’s ; her face
relaxed, and it was as thougn
someone had suddenly
drenched her cheeks with
wine. Uncle acted ridiculous-
ly, jerked his head backward,
and made the following irrele-
vant remark : “If Bobbie
hits me on the nose agin I’ll
stop it with me right.”
Norah took a strange in-
terest in Bobbie —he, too, was
gipsy-dark, and not a bit like
Aunt—and it was stranger
still that he should permit
this immobile woman to take
him in her arms. If he
mounted a horse she would
steal by, watching fearfully,
until Aunt bustled-up, saying,
“Oh, my goodness ! the ani-
mal won’t bite him.”
Norah would grip the bridle
with both hands.
“ But he isn’t old enough to
handle a raw man-eater like
this. Oh, Emily ! Sup-
pose. ...”
Aunt would suddenly leave.
At a preconcerted signal,
Bobbie and Norah would steal
from the homestead by dif-
erent tracks, only to meet
again beyond the bridge. And
the gully would hide them in
its tree-flanked depths, while
the big eucalyptus spoke to the
high wind above, saying: “Not here; not here.
1 lush, sh, sh, sli ! ” And from some invisible hollow
would come the echo of Norah’s voice : “ Oh, my
dear; oh, my dear !” Strange, too, that no one ever
hunted for them. Aunt would turn from the
children to wipe a bit of soot from her cheeks,
saying: “Oh, let them alone. Norah’s terribly
fond of the lad. God help us, it’s a queer world ! ’
Uncle Jim’s position was hard to define.
* » * *
One day Norah was sitting under the big
eucalypti, patching the children’s clothes. Uncle
came out of the shed where he had been talking
to a saddle—one he had won in a raffle. He
stopped as he caught sight of her, shuffling his
feet uneasily ; a new brand of blush suffused h:s
sun-dried visage as she turned and caught his eye.
He became a study in jerks. “ Well, Norah —well,
Norah, my gel, how yer bin giftin’ on ? ” He looked
at the sky and then towards the homestead, where
aunt’s big shadow leaped to and fro across the
doorway. “Ye had a long spell away, Norah ? I
should say ye had a roarty time of it here and
thear.”
Norah clicked her needle, but did not meet his
glance again. After a while she spoke, and her
voice was keyed in a loud whisper.
“Jim, I had a great time. I was never sorry
that I left you until I heard that my son had
grown so fine, and ... I came home. Jim, shall
I speak the truth ? ”
Uncle threw out his insignificant chest and
breathed hard. “Speak th’ truth, Norah —by-
gones is bygones.”
“ Well, Jim, I had a great time. Living with
you was horrible—l don’t want to offend —but it
was ghastly. So I cleared with a young drover
and overlanded it to Adelaide. Mother was a
gipsy, you know, and father an Irish planter, and
I had blood in me that sang to every word a man
dared buzz in my ear. I didn’t stay with my
drover sweetheart long . . . Oh no, not long. . . .
Jim, I’ve lived, lived ! If you think that I regret
my past you are wrong. I wish I could live my
life again.”
Her nimble fingers worked steadily ; she did
not take her eyes from the ground. “ Jim, how
—how have you been enjoying yourself ? ”
Uncle cast a rapid glance at the homestead,
and then took in a sharp breath.
“ Oh hell ! ” he said.
Aunt came to the verandah stealthily and cast
a swift glance in their direction.
“Jim ! ” she shouted, “ come here.”
Uncle loafed towards her, whistling absent] >\
Aunt’s eyes went from his face to Norah’s. S' e
frowned. “Jim, you’ll have to watch yourself,
d’ye hear ? ”
“Eh?” Uncle straightened himself suddenly.
“ Oh, what rot ! ” He turned away and walked
in the direction of Brannigan’s Hole.
Uncle Jim’s position is hard to define !
ALBA DORION.
“ Raspberry ” : When present scribe had
occasion, some years ago, to visit a certain un-
pretentious Tasmanian hamlet, it was a gay place,
consisting of a pub., a bobby, and 400 goats. A
strong goaty odour pervaded the vicinity, and, on
the evening of his arrival, writer was treated to
cold boiled goat and damper. Sustained by
golden visions of fish for the morrow’s breakfast,
he retired to a ghostly four-poster in the front
bedroom. All that night an endless procession of
goats sprinted through the verandah, bleating
horribly, whilst the owners of the caravanserai
snored, sweetly somewhere in the back. The
local goats appeared to be purely nocturnal in
their habits, the perfume alone telling of their
existence by day. Next morning there was
damper and fried goat for breakfast. The fisher-
man had forgotten to call, or catch, or some-
thing. For dinner, we had hot roast goat
and damper, and for tea damper and cold
roast goat. It was a trifle monotonous, but
so it went on—curried goat, grilled goat, hashed
goat, minced goat, hot stuffed goat, and cold
baked goat, and always the deathless damper.
One night it rained, and a multitude of goats
c .mped in the verandah. After heaving all the
furniture that would conveniently go out of the
window, writer fell into an uneasy slumber ; and
about sunrise was aroused by an ungodly disturb-
ance outside. On investigation he observed the
boss of the establishment chasing a herd of goats
round the building with a gun. After about three
laps he let fly and one of the fugitives dropped its
hind-end to the ground, but fled serenely along on
its forequarters, till the eldest hope of the family
smote it on the head with an axe. Then the
missus, clad mostly in purple corsets and red
carpet-slippers, rushed out and sawed its head off
with the bread-knife. That day I fled.

Cardy's Example!
A GOOD THING IN GODS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I don’t know what nation had the honor of pro-
ducing Cardy. His name was apparently an in-
genious contrivance for affiliating him, at will,
with any one of the four countries whose lan-
guages he spoke with equal fluency. “Cardy ”
presumably English—became French ip “Carde,”
Italian in “Cardi,” German in “Karde.” But
even the additional possession of sundry oriental
dialects didn’t make Cardy vain of his linguistic
attainments.
“ What’s the use,” he said, “of a man speaking
half-a-dozen languages, if he’s got to be a fool in
all of them ? ”
From which observation it will be evident that
Mr. Cardy himself was no fool. To what extent
he was the “other thing” I had not been able to
determine, for the pietetic element in his
talk, instead of being spread ostentatiously on
the surface thereof, was rather woven into it with
a skill that made me sometimes fancy I had
chanced at last upon a real live Christian, instead
of merely a pretender whose methods were less
crude than common.
At a little port on the south coast—which I
shall pseudonymise as Momanglain—Cardy told
me the steamer was to drop him. There he had
lived, he said, for a good many years, and there
he had been “enabled to do some excellent work
amongst the heathen.”
If he had called himself a “ humble instrument,”
or finished up with “ Praise the Lord ! ” my pre-
sent reader would never have heard of him. One
of his words, as it was, gave me its accustomed
jar.
“ Heathen ? ” I repeated. “ Mahometanism
isn’t heathenism. It’s as monotheistic as Christi-
anity ; more so, in fact—for you’ve got three
gods ! Of course ”
“When I said ‘heathen,’” Cardy put in, “I
meant heathen ! Haven’t you heard of the Rock
Temple of Momanglain ? ”
Of course I had, and of course I ought to have
remembered that in localities where reminders of
the old faith abound, Javanese Mahometanism is
little more than a name.
“It is one of the great sights of Java,” Cardy
said. “ Alas ! that such immense labour should
have been expended upon a mere monument of
superstition.
“ Oh, well,” I said, “ if you come to that, pretty
well everything that endures is the work of super-
stition.”
“My young friend,” Cardy answered, with the
nearest approach he had yet made to the groan-
commiserative, “you are, I regret to perceive,
deeply tainted with the appalling scepticism of
the age.”
“ Deeply tainted with an objection to be led by
the nose ! But, with regard to this temple, I
should very much like to see it. I think I’ll land
with you, and wait for the return-boat.”
“Do. And if you’ll stay with me I shall be
glad to have you.”
“ Very kind ! But don’t think me ungracious if
I ask, have you an eye to my ‘regeneration,’ as
the phrase goes ? ”
“ Well,” Cardy said, blandly, “as far as Chris-
tian example goes, I trust you may receive spiri-
tual benefit. Precept, I fear— ”
“ Would be thrown away ? You are right; but
I can stand any quantity of example.” •
It did not take me long to see that it
was only the old story —Cardy’s weasel-
eyed catechumens were Christian only to the
extent that Christianity meant credit at the
establishment wherefrom the Bible-dispensing
Cardy dispensed also the knife that cutteth not,
the gun that bursteth, and the cane-rum that
slayeth afar off. For of such matters —as well as
of Manchester shoddy and Birmingham pinchbeck
—Cardy was the only importer in Momanglain;
and I wasn’t much surprised to see how quickly
Salvation had to sit behind lucre when, on the
second day of my stay, a sawn-off old waggon of a
‘ ‘ country-wallah ” made her appearance with a
cargo re-consigned to Cardy from Singapore.
“ I’ll be up to my neck in it for the rest of the
week,” he said; “so I can’t go with you to the
temple myself. But I'll send Sajib with you—he
can jabber a little Malay.”
* * * *
The early sun was red upon the huge facade
that rose sheer out of a dark-green tangle of wild
pine-apple, azalea and vanilla—with here and
there a cotton-tufted cuppoo, throwing a graceful
shadow on the ruddy rock. My guide—three feet
of coffee-colored urchin, bisected by a six-inch
strip of blue batek —looked askance at the cotton-
trees. They were favorites, he told me, in such
Malay as he could muster, of the Poontiana —a
child-destroying demon much dreaded by these
people. This particular Poontiana, it appeared,
resided in a secret part of the temple before us.
“ But, with a white lord,” concluded the imp, “ I
fear not. Let us go up, lord ! ”
About twenty feet above us—reached by a flight
of worn stone steps —a square, door-like opening
was all—except the mighty scarping of the whole
vast rock—that showed the handiwork of man.
But, inside, by the light of the dawiar-torches, we
passed from chamber into chamber, each larger
than the one outside it, and all —in their dumb
destitution of emblem and ornament —their blind
privation of altar and of statue —more augustly
terrible than anything ever evolved from the
hyper-symbolical religion of the Hindus.
“ This is no Indie work,” I reflected, as we stood
in the middle of a chamber so immense that the
strong red light of our torches barely showed us
the far-away walls, and failed altogether to touch
the roof. “Some austerer and elder faith it was
that thus sublimated simplicity and left every-
thing so magnificently to the imagination. Let
us go on, Sajib ! ”
But the boy, when we got to what appeared to
be the inner egress by a narrow, slit-like passage,
objected with much trembling and a further re-
ference to the Poontiana.
“ There is only a cave,” he said —“near the sea.
And the passage thereto becometh low and narrow
as for a crawling beast, not for a great white lord.
Also, Cardee-Father hath seen the Poontiana in
that cave with his own eyes ! ”
“Cardy?” exclaimed the “great white lord,”
beginning to smell a rat.
“ Ay, lord ! And Cardee-Father knoweth all
things. Therefore go not in, lest thy bones be
made naked and thy friends brought to sorrow ! ”
Let Sajib stay then ; I would go in alone. But
at this he quaked more than ever. If the Poon-
tiana happened to be out, and, coming back,
should find him there alone, he was but a lost
Sajib ! _
I gave up the point, but as we went back
towards daylight I took the distance roughly in
paces, and made it 230 yards.
“ That certainly ought to go nearly to the sea-
face of the rock,” I thought, “and perhaps there's
an opening to the beach. And perhaps, again,
the ingenuous Cardy has an object in scaring the
natives away with this Poontiana-rubbish. Hanged
if I don’t come back here by myself, and see
if by any possibility this ‘just man made per-
feet ’ is coquetting with his Netherlandic Majesty’s
import duties.”
• • * •
Atduskof nextevening—as soonasCardy, piously
deploring the interruption to his bible-reading
classes, had gone down to the ship again—l set
out for the temple, equipped with my trusty little
Smith-Wesson, a pocket-compass, a flask of arrack,
and half-a-dozen damar-sticks.
It was a perfectly breathless night, with a
gauzy haze over the stars, and the slow regularity
of a sleeper’s breathing in the surf-pulse of the
resting ocean. Faintly the rhythmic fall came to
me over the huge rock as I clambered up the steps
and passed into the immemorial mystery of this
shrine that enshrined nothing but an idea,
I lit my torch, and went on—counting,
this time, the chambers I passed through.
Eight there were ; increasing in breadth from
about 5 yards for the first to no less than 60 for
the enormous final apartment, which had also a
length, as I found by stepping it, of 90 yards !
Ludicrously disproportionate to these vast
measurements appeared the fissure-like passage
by which I had to seek what had been, probably,
the adytum of this remarkable exemplar of
human persistence. About seven feet high, as I
judged—the passage was hardly two feet wide,
and, with the light held over my head, I fr’.lowed
it without noticing the gradual depression of the
roof, until the torch touched the stone above me.
Lower and lower, until I was obliged to stoop ;
then lower still—till, upon hands and knees, I had
to recognise that the height of the passage was
now only equal to its breadth. Badly hampered
by the torch, I crawled through about 20 yards of
these dimensions before I found myself suddenly
in the presumed residence of Sajib’s Poontiana.
It was, as he had said, a cave—inasmuch as the
roof was roughly vaulted by the hand of nature,
The sides I had no time to examine, for, from
somewhere not faraway, I caught at that moment
the voice of the saintly Cardy, vigorously cursing
somebody’s eyes—“and did they think he was
going to get a year or two in Padak because they
didn’t know how to parbuckle a blanketty cask
any more than so many beatified old women ! ”
Cut went my torch, and down went myself into
a corner, as a sudden opening in the gloom let me
see for a moment half-a-dozen figures struggling
against the stars. Then a few hurried words in
varying voices—all with the quick note of surrep-
titiousness—the dump of something heavy on the
rocky floor—and darkness again, until the flare of
a vesta sho wed me Cardy’s self-satisfied face, as,
with a soft whistling of “Safe in the Arms,”
he applied the match to a lamp brilliant enough
to enlighten me as to the distinguished coni-
pany I was in.
I was surrounded by gods !
In brass, and bronze, and earthenware ; care-
fully arranged in stacks, or contemptuously
tumbled into heaps ; Brahminically correct, schis-
matically erroneous in number of heads or arms,
or openly indicative of the debased phallicism of
ancient Java—here they were, in a multitude to
which Cardy was even now contributing from the
cask that had been hoisted-up and which he had
skilfully unheaded,
“Now, that,” and he held up to the light a
curiously-contorted brass Dramaja, “is a pretty
piece of work. I ought to know something about
these things, and hang me if I could swear this
wasn’t the best Burmese woik. How these
Brummagem chaps manage it is more than I
know ! ”
“ Christian example—eh, Cardy?”
The sudden voice, tumbling back in weird
echoes from the roof, made him start so that the
little brass god fell clattering into the cask again.
But he was quick to grasp the situation.
“ Oh, you’re there, are you ? ” he said carelessly,
“Come on deck! Now, what”—he added,
slowly, as I got up out of the shadows— “ what is
to prevent me putting a bullet into this ex-
ceedingly injudicious young man ? ”
“ Christianity ! ” suggested the injudicious one.
Cardy reflected my grin “ We’ll consider
Christianity ‘off,’ ” he said.
“It’s about time!”—and I took out my revol-
ver. “But, how does this go ?”
“ One better ! You’re a young man of foresight,
Brains, too ! You took my holiness alongside per-
haps, but I could see that you never exactly
hoisted it in.”
Coolly enough said, all this—considering the
shock attested by the fellow’s trembling fingers as
he went on unpacking his cask of paganism,
“Here!” I handed him my flask. “Hoist
some of that in !—and explain me this
pantheon business. All these gods, I mean ;
where do you get ’em, and what do you do with
’em ? ”
A liberal draught brought a flux of blood to his
f ace and of impudence to his manner,
“I get ’em from England—pious England !
the secret of whose greatness, they say, is the
Bible. And the biggest man in this god-making
hue is a pillar of some missionary society or other.
Oh, Lord ! ”—and Cardy chuckled till he choked—
then emptied the flask,
“And you?”
“Oh, I follow suit ! Any ass can run the ordi-
nary snuffiebusting business, but I fancy it’s a
stroke of genius to be ‘ converting ’ a couple of
score Javanese with the one hand, so to speak,
a fl d supplying idols to a couple of million of ’em
with the other !”
“ And this is your warehouse ? ”
“Has been!—for I suppose your conscience
won’t allow you to let the little game go on any
longer?”
“ Haven’t any conscience worth speaking of ! ”
I said, as I lit up my torch again. “ It’s only holy
humbugs like you and your Birmingham joss-
maker who make a fuss about their ‘ consciences.’
As for this god-importing business, it seems to me
you’ll hurt these people less with it than with
V our special brand of Christianity. I won’t inter-
fere.”
T) * * * *
. But fate dld ! A few months later Cardy “fell
la ” over an attempted opium-run, and now, I
understand, adorns the select society of Padak
Island—himself adorned in turn with a coarse
blue jacket, a big red number, and a neat steel
anklet.

fin HE advent of the
I Christmas Holidays
is as heartily wel-
comed in New South Wa’es
as in England, and its value
locally is greater, in the
opportunity it affords the
metropolitan or the inland
resident of taking a rest at
a time when climatic condi-
tions cause a respite from
labour to be most enjoyed.
The former has every facility
for escaping for a time from
the routine of city life to
the cool atmosphere of the
charming mountain region
that lies so close to Sydney,
or the more distant, but
still easily accessible, snow
country “ down by Kosci-
usko.”
The inland dweller finds
the change equally pleasant
in leaving his wide and
silent areas to seek pleasure
in the many holiday attrac-
tions provided in the metro-

OJST THE HAWHESBURY RIVER,
polis, or to enjoy the charms of the sea-
side. All are well-provided-for by the ex-
tended railway facilities arranged for at
Christmas time.
Sydney forms the main starting-
point for holiday-makers, most of the
leading pleasure resorts being readily and
cheaply accessible from the metropolis,
but the system of Holiday Excursion
Tickets enables country residents to visit
the principal beauty spots in their own
districts Thus, pleasure-seekers living
in Goulburn can enjoy the beauties of
the lovely country in which the FITZ-
ROY, MERYLA, and the other falls are
situated, or make a trip to the summit of
MOUNT KOSCIUSKO, while others resid-
ing in Bathurst may proceed to the
JENOLAN CAVES or the BLUE
MOUNTAINS, without the trouble or
cost of a journey to Sydney.
Special Excursion Tickets from Sydney
enable most of the picturesque localities
within easy reach of the metropolis to be
conveniently and economically visited.
On the Northern Line is KURRING-
GAI Chase, the new National Park, in
the heart of which is COWAN CREEK,
with its unlimited facilities for boating
and fishing ; the HAWKESBURY
RIVER, queen of Australian streams, on
which delightful trips may be made by
the commodious steamer General Gor-
don ; BRISBANE WATER, the TUG-
GER AH LAKES, and LAKE MAC-
QUARIE, where boating, sailing, fishing,
bathing, and other sports may be enjoyed
to the uttermost, alternated with delight-
ful rambles among the ferns and flowers
of the surrounding country.
To the West is the NEPEAN RIVER,
with its lovely surroundings ; the BLUE
MOUNTAINS, with their magnificent
panoramic views, glorious waterfalls and
beautiful scenery ; each stopping place
having its own special attractions; while
from KATOOMBA or MOUNT VIC-
TORIA a visit may be made by coach or
on horseback to the JENOLAN CAVES,
the great natural marvels of Australia,
and said to be equal to anything of their
kind in existence. The Government has
also recently provided excellent accommo-
dation convenient to the Caves, while the
road journey to them is alone worth the
trip, even if the subterranean wonders
did not exist.
Southwards is the charming tourist
district between MITTAGONG and
GOULBURN, which i s
rapidly becoming a fashion-
able Summer resort. From
here either by way of BOW-
RAL or MOSS YALE, the
FITZROY, BELMORE,
MERYLA, LODDEN, and
other singularly picturesque
waterfalls may be visited,
and a descent effected by
way of KANGAROO
VALLEY, the BULLI
PASS, o r MACQUARIE
PASS, into the richly fertile
Illawarra District. From
GOULBURN, Holiday Ex-
cursion Tickets can be
obtained for LAKE
BATHURST; Bungen-
dore, for LAKE GEORGE
or Cooma, for the YAR-
RANGOBILLY OAVES,
the most extensive in Aus-
tralia, fairly rivalling the
beauty of those at Jenolan ;
or the SNOWY MOUN-
TAINS, with their lofty
peaks glistening in the
oright sunshine, where, on the summit of
Mount Kosciusko, the visitormay enjoy the
refreshing coolness of an Alpine climate
during the hottest months of the year, a
pleasure unique in Australian tourist
travel. On the Illawarra or South Coast
Line is the NATIONAL PARK, the
grand and picturesque area reserved
for the people, the lower waters o
PORT HACKING RIVER within
the Park being much frequented by
lovers of boating and fishing. Beyond
the Park lies the enchanting ILLA-
WARRA region, the “ Garden of
New South Wales,” a land of fern and
and palm, with CLIFTON, BULL),
WOLLONGONG and other delightfully-
situated seaside townships ; Lake Illa-
warra, Kiama, with its wonderful
“ BLOW HOLE,” and Nowra, the
southern dairy-farming metropolis.

“ Mr. Hearne. —
“ Dear Sir, —I enclose for your own private perusal
portion of a letter received from my mother, Mrs. ,
of London, England, from which you will glean that
your medicine has been a perfect God-send to a martyr to
colds and bronchial asthma. Ido not wish any names to
be mentioned, but you are at liberty to make use of any
portion of this letter you choose, and you can confidently
refer anybody to me.
“ I heard of your excellent remedy, and sent it to Eng-
land. You can see for yourself v. hat an immense success
it was.—Yours faithfully, .”
Extract from letter alluded to above
“You will be interested in hearing that I think the
Bronchitis Cure really excellent. I was very bad when it
arrived, and I immediately flew to it. That was last
Friday, and it has quite cured me. Dr. is very
much interested in it. He came yesterday, and carried
off the empty bottle to find out if he could get a full one
from a chemist who is in a large way here.”
The names are withheld from publication, but will be
supplied privately when desired.

“ Dear Sir,—l wish to add my testimony to the won-
derful effect of your Bronchitis Cure. I suffered for nine
months, and the cough was so distressingly bad at nights
I was obliged to get up and sit by the fire. I had medical
advice, and tried other ‘ remedies,’ without avail. I tried
yours, and never had a fit of coughing after taking the
first dose, and though I have had but two bottles I feel I
am a different man, and the cough has vanished. You
may depend upon my making known the efficacy of your
wonderful remedy to anyone I see afflicted.
“ Yours faithfully,
“ JAMES ASTBURY.”

the most effective, and if there is anybody in Victoria
who during' the last few years has been repeatedly work-

Cure, it is our Mr. Phillips.
“This gentleman, some three years ago, was recom-
mended to try your Bronchitis Cure by Mr. Barham, ac-
countant, Collins-street, and the effect that it had was so
marked that he has ever since been continually reoom-
mending it to others.
“ We are glad to add this our testimony to the value or
Hearne’s most valuable Bronchiris Cure, w hich has eased
the sufferings of hundreds and hundreds of people even
in our own circle of acquaintance.
“ Believe us always to be,

HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? It so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CURE YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured.

VITADATIO
Mr. S. A. PALMER,
Agent for Webber’s “ Vitadatio.”
Sir, —It is with feelings of deep and heartfelt gratitude
that I write to thank you for the benefit I have received
from “ Vitadatio.” It has honestly made a grand change
in my life. For the past 15 years I have been a martyr to
indigestion in its worst form. For over 2 (two) years I
was practically helpless, being doubled up and quite
unable to straighten myself. My stomach was so weak
that I was unable to take more than four ounces of very
light food per day, consequently I became weak gener-
ally, and within a short time I fell away to a mere skele-
ton. I was attended by some of our leading doctors, and
must have drank gallons of various kinds of medicine, all
to no purpose. Whilst in this miserable condition I read
of several cures of indigestion by “ Vitadatio,” and almost
as a last resource I decided to give it a trial, and right
glad lam that I did so. After a few large bottles I felt
great relief. I continued with the medicine, and all along
could feel the “ slow but sure ” return of health, until
here I am to-day perfectly restored and without an ache
or pain in the stomach after food. I can now eat three
good meals per day and enjoy them. lam at a loss for
words wherewith to express my gratitude, but you may
be sure I shall spread the good news that Webber’s
Vitadatio can, and has, cured indigestion in its worst
form.
I hand you this testimonial perfectly voluntarily, and
you may have my permission to use it as you deem advis-
able. I shall be pleased to interview and give details of
my case to anyone.

The Law’s Delay.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One morning, .when Bill James went up to oil the
pulleys, a sudden gust of wind toppled him off the
poppet-heads, and he was sent to hospital ; so
I had to do a double shift at the winding-engine
pending his replacement.
His successor, Cyrus V. Johnson, was a stranger
on the Lead, a quiet, self-possessed, capable man,
with a slight nasal accent and a dark goatee.
Cyrus applied for accommodation at the
Southern Cross, where I hung-out ; but the house
happened to be full. He could board there if he
pleased, Dodd told him, but must find temporary
lodgings elsewhere. Cyrus submitted to this,
only soliciting permission to pitch his 6xB in the
back of the hotel yard for the time being.
A fortnight or three weeks afterwards there was
a vacancy ; and Dodd offered Cyrus the half-room
with alacrity, inasmuch as the tent was proving a
greater obstruction and eyesore than had been
anticipated.
But Cyrus expressed a reluctance to make
trouble. Reckoned to hustle along comfortable
enough, now that he had set up his tabernacle.
Within the next /fortnight there were several
vacancies ; and the sight of the 6xB was becoming
more and more insufferable to Dodd.
“Look here, Johnson,” said he, at length,
“that tent of yours is a nuisance. If you don’t
remove the darned thing, I’ll pull it down and
chuck it into the road.”
“Better see your solicitor first, Colonel,” sug-
gested the man in possession.
Dodd invested 10s. 6d. in legal advice, and
learned that Cyrus had acquired a prescriptive
usufructuary interest in the land on which the
tent stood, as well as right-of-way thereto by
affirmative easement. Further, that his freedom
of domicile was impregnable at Common Law,
inasmuch as livery of seisin had been ceded un-
conditionally, and all claim for socage had lapsed
by consent. Hence the landlord was debarred
privilege of entry, as well as of escheat. And as
the grantee’s right was indeterminate as well as
allodial, no process of eviction would lie. Even a
nominal rent might have been multiplied to ex-
orbitance, and recovered by action of assumpsit,
with distraint on the tenement; but it was legally
impossible to translate a moral obligation into a
cash liability. And to seize the tent without
warrant would be merely placing in Johnson’s
hands the formidable right of replevin, as pro-
vided by 2 Will. IV., c. 39, sec. 21. Even to
enter the tenement by force was a thing that the
Queen of England, with all her army, couldn’t do
—much less a common licensed-victualler. Never-
theless, if Dodd would place £2OO to the credit of
his legal adviser, that learned gentleman would
take steps to have the case tested in Equity—
“ Steady, for Gossake! ” groaned Dodd.
“ Could anything be done to me for putting im-
provements on my own place, sposen I don’t inter-
fere with the tent itself ”
“If you obstruct Johnston’s right-of-way, you
certainly render yourself liable to a civil action of
estoppel by matter in pais.”
“ I’ll chance it, anyhow. If he summonses me,
I’ll show him up. And never another meal he sits
down to in my house from this out.”
Next morning—Cyrus being on day-shift—Dodd
procured 24 sheets of the longest corrugated-iron
available, with such timber as was required ; and
in a few hours the tent was enclosed by an un-
broken wall, 12ft. high and 12ft. square, the fur-
ther side being merely nailed to the paling fence
of the hotel yard.
But a couple of bare-footed boys had been glee-
fully scouting for Cyrus, and when that tenacious
citizen returned from work he brought with him
two light ladders, each 14ft. long. He leaned one
of these against the wall, and, ascending within a
yard of the top, he placed the other on the inside,
and bolted the tops firmly together. Then
nodding a courteous good-night to Dodd, he dis-
appeared over the brim.
Next day Dodd had the carpenter at work again,
raising the leaguer another 12ft., till it seemed to
command the Lead like a martello tower; the
ladders, of course, remaining in position.
But there was no appearance of Cyrus at knock-
off time. An hour passed ; then Dodd, in the
fullness of his heart, asked all hands in to have a
drink —for by this time the whole Lead was taking
an interest in the controversy. Presently, stroll-
ing back into the yard, the assembled quidnuncs
heard a faint rattle of tin table-service from within
the fortification, indicating that the firmly-rooted
tenant was at supper.
Immediate examination with a bull’s-eye lamp
showed the wall of circumvallation intact on all
sides, but also revealed the pegs of an alluvial
claim abutting on the rear of the hotel allotment,
and an aperture bandicooted under the wall.
Dodd pronounced a benediction, and the con-
gregation dispersed in reverent silence.
“Reckon I got the rortiest little squat on this
diggin’s; pard,” remarked Cyrus, when he came
to relieve me next morning. “ Sort o’ hermitage,
right agen the business centre. Wouldn’t sell her
for a red cent less’n 20 notes.”
Eventually, however, he compromised for
£l7 10s., with the right to remove the tabernacle.

TOM COLLINS.
His Salary.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was in the good old days of rough hand-harvest-
ing, 16-ox teams, sweltering dust heats, bush settle-
ments, Maori raids and big cheques in Taranaki.
Dan Boyle jogged into New Plymouth by the
south road, on a sweltering hot day, with a £75
cheque—the result of four months’ toil—a super-
abundant self-satisfaction, a chronic thirst, ac-
cumulated during aforesaid four months, and a
settled determination to “lay himself out,” and
“ to do it in,” and “ make a name for himself” in
the approved fashion. His idea was to hit upon
some chum who was prepared to devote himself
body and soul to the proposed spree, and to
“make things hum” while funds lasted. But
Dan found the accomplishment far more difficult
than the conception, for his ideal chum could not
be found. True, he stumbled across several
kindred spirits with whom he severally lubricated;
but no single one with whom he shared that
mental and moral affinity—-that perfect harmony
of idea and spirit—so essential to the complete
accomplishment of the brotherly drunk which
Daniel had in view.
Disappointed and perplexed, he strolled out of
the pub. and along a road that led into the open
country under the mountain. After about 20
minutes walk, he overtook a bullock - dray, re-
turning from town. He proffered the usual salu-
tation, and, on the solitary occupant of the dray
returning it with “ Good-day ! ” Dan jumped 2ft.
in the air and ejaculated :
“Bob, by all that’s holy! Come down outer
that donkified hassification you’re the feller
I’ve been looking for all day, and I’m blowed
if I could think of yer. I want yer ! Climb
down ! ”
“ Carn’t —toilin’,” laconically replied Bob.
“What’s the job worth ? ” asked Dan.
“ Five bob er day ! ”
“ Git down ! ” said Dan. “ I’ll give yer fi’ bob
er day t’ help me blew me cheque. ”
Bob cogitated, scratched his head, hesitated,
rolled his quid, and finally said, “What erbout
the dray ? ”
“ Whose is it ? ”
“ Saunders’s ! ”
“ I’ll go along while ye go in an’ call-off, an’ yer
can walk back with me.”
“ Right ! ” said Bob shortly.
Whereupon they safely delivered dray and bul-
locks. Bob briefly terminated his engagement,
and returned to town with Dan, and the Great
Taranaki Drunk was instituted.
* • * •
One evening, a month later, Dan raised his head
from his pillow (he was lying fully dressed on the
bed), and with one half-opened eye looked round
on the swollen and unsteady landscape. Then he
reached out his hand towards a chair that stood
by the bedside, took therefrom a bottle of beer,
drank, put it back, and articulated feebly :
“ Bob, ’y’ ’wake ? ”
“’M’— ! ”
‘‘Bob, ole feller—did it all in t’night. Las’
quid ! ”
“’ M >— j”
“’Avtergit back —mornin’.”
“’M’__!”
“G’night!”
“ Ni’ ! ”
• • • •
Next morning Dan and Bob got up early, for
them, had a wash, sat down at the table, looked
at the breakfast, got up again and went outside.
“ Bob,’ said Dan feelingly, “ the game’s goosed ;
’M off back ter the station. 01’ man, I never ’ad
s’ha time ’n me life. Yer bin a real frien’ ter me,
ol’ man, ’n I’ll never forget it, an’ next time I come
in I’ll look y’up first thing. Gi’s yer ’and ”
Dan’s voice quivered with suppressed alcohol as
they gripped. Then Bob said (he seldom said
anything):
“’Here!—l bin gettin’ this ’ere fi’ bob a day
frer month ’n I ain’t touched it yet. S’pose ”
Dan’s mouth opened and closed again slowly.
“Bob!” he said; “I never had a mother like
you—never!”
And they went inside.

The Cheery Coffinmaker.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A certain Sydney undertaker well upholds the
reputation of his brothers of the trade as grim
humorists. In one of the coffins —open so that
the inside workmanship should be seen—in his
show-window, there is a large copy of ‘ ‘ The Day
of J udgment.” In the coffin next to it is a copy
of Dore’s representation of Dante’s Inferno ! As
much as to say —“You get into one of these
coffins of mine—-and there you are ! ” But a rival
eoffinmaker in the same street is a much more cheer-
ing soul. He has actually decorated his window in
the most approved Christmas fashion. Wisterias
and nasturtiums and honeysuckle make a floral
frame for the contents of the window, and climb-
ing roses of many hues riot gaily over the recep-
tacles intended for the future dead.
The merry Christmas Season
Makes tradesmen full of cheer ;
The eoffinmaker only
His shop-front keeps austere.
The shops of all the others
Are brave with blossoms bright—
Why should the coffinmaker’s
Be such a joyless sight ?
All’s well! An undertaker
This year has taken care
That in the merry season
His trade shall have its share.
He’s decked his tasty caskets,
In manner fair to see,
With blooms of many colors,
And cheerful greenery.
They seem, in floral language,
To passers-by to say—
“ O be a corpse at Christmas !
There’s naught in life so gay.”
O, gentle undertaker,
It was a kindly thought !
And if, as eoffinmaker,
You don’t succeed—you ought.
If, when this writer dies, he
Should own a pound or two,
He’ll leave his heirs instructions
To deal—for him—with you.
Then let us all, dear Brethren,
Go gaily to the tomb,
In the merry Christmas season,
When coffins are in bloom.

The N.S. W. Old Age Pensions Bill, though
a most valuable commencement, will have to be
amended sooner or later. So will the Maoriland
pension law. The age is fixed too high, and will
prevent the Bill doing so much as it should to
abolish the present state of charitable anarchy.
Sooner or later the Old Age Pension limit must
come down to GO. Otherwise there will be two
stages of old-age indigence: the pauper stage,
during which the decayed citizen will waste away
in the asylum while waiting to qualify for the
pension ; and the (comparatively) golden age
when he who has come through the great tribula-
tion of a term of asylum life will attain his
pension of 10s. per week. Also, 10s. is too little,
and will have to be supplemented by private
charity; it would pay the working classes to
endure some slight increase of taxation to provide
sufficient to keep the aged toiler out of the labor
market altogether. The decaved citizen cannot
live as he ought to live for less than 15s. per week.
Sublime is the calmness with which the
N.S.W. community—for want of a little simple
legislation (or vigorous administration of existent
law) —goes on poisoning itself through its over-
confiding stomach. Out of 339 samples of alleged
food and drink examined last year by the Govern-
ment Analyst 119 were adulterated. That is to
say that over 35 per cent, of the vendors of these
articles have been—putting gastric considerations
aside —simply obtaining money under false pre-
tences. It is probably the characteristic British
indifference to the welfare of the person as com-
pared with thric-e-sacred “ Property ” that has left
English-speaking communities so barbarously be-
hind the times in this respect. In France and
Germany the adulterator is remorselessly nosed-
out and prosecuted ; and in the former country at
least, after paying a heavy fine, or going to gaol
in default, the offender has to exhibit for a speci-
fied time, at the main entrance of his place of
business, an official notification that on such a day
Jean Craomd was convicted of adulteration and
fined so much.
A PRAHRAN PROOF.
Drugs, Doctors, and Hospitals prove quite
impotent.
Clements Tonic Brought in and all Diseases
Melt Away.
The Case of
MRS. ELIZABETH HILL,
Another Proof for Sceptics.
Of the many populous suburbs suri ound-
ing Melbourne not one is to be compared to
l’rahran ; its main stieet of thriving stores,
roads lowered in trees, and the beauty and
animation of the whole place, make a most
attiactive locality. r ihis was the feeling of
our reporter as he trod tne busy footpath of
Chapel-street seeking for No. 24 Chatham-
street, the home of Mis. Elizabeth Hill.
This lady’s residence was easily found, for
it is close to the Town Hall and the main
artery of traffic. The iady hexself chanced
to be at home, and in answer to our ques-
tions graciously consented to relate her
remarkable expei it nee :
“Some time ago,” said Mrs. Hill, “I
Buffered from one of the accidents peculiar
to married women. I was properly attended
and cared for, yet the shock to my system
was such that no medicine or food would
give me back my past health and vigor.
Something was radically wrong with me, I
had no recuperative power, and time,
instead of making me stronger, weakened
me.”
“Did you go to a doctor, Mrs. Hill?”
inquired the reporter.
“ I went to three medical men altogether.
First to our regular doctor, who said I was
suffering from neivous debility ; but his
treatment doing me no goed, 1 tried another
doctor, and later, when my husband went
to West Australia, 1 became an out-patient
at the hospital. But the result was always
the same; no matter where I went, the
drug!- prescribed were quite impotent to do
me good.”
“ What were the syn ptoms, Mrs. Hill, of
,his complaint that so set medical skill at
defiance? ’ inquired the ptessm n.
“lhada dieadful pain in the back part
of the top of my head, a fearful, horrible,
agonising pain that made me feel I was
going mad. Look ! it turned my hair quite
grey in that spot.” (The reporter here
notices that in the place indicated by Mrs.
Hill her naturally dark hair was streaked
with white.] “I could not sleep at night,nor
get proper rest, horrible dreams woke me
up in a cold sweat if I got a short doze, and
the hallucination would remain with me
after I was fairly awake, for I would jump
out of bed with terror and hurry from the
room. Only when the daylight was just
shining in the morning was I able to close
my eyes for a short time. As I lay restless
in bed, turning uneasily from side to side, I
tried all the ways I could think of to induce
sleep. I would count figures over and over
again, or repeat lines of poetry in endless
repetition ; but it was no use, for the <nd of
every effort was that my mind switched
back to the constantly melancholy thoughts
that possessed me. And the least thing
would excite this morbid brooding ; if I read
something horrible in the newspaper, some
murder or the like, I had a sort of irresist-
ible feeling that I was about to be 'nvolved
in a like catastrophe. This dread ,vou dso
master me that I dart d not stay in the
hfiuse, but had to go to my mother’s for her
company and assurance. The least thing
startled me, I would leap right out of my
chair at a sudden noise, even though I
expected it. My husband, knowing this,
would walk >. r\ quietly into the room and
touch me with lis hand g.-ntly; yet this
would mak'Vme tremb eall oyer with a kind
•f shiver. After these nei vous shocks rrry
yeart would flutter and vibrate, and if I
were iq bed J could hear it go thump
liniitup as it seemed to in <ve the covering.
1 rent iqber that once ti e doctor gave me a i
deeping diaught; he said it was of vital
importune* that I should have rest, and I
“'as so delighted thinking of the ob ivion
that was g mg to come for a short time to
my misery, that I got excited with expecta-
tion, and the medicine had no effect. It
was quite a common thing for me to ciy and
soh all night long. I simply could not eat
at ail, 1 had no app Lite, I became very
thin, losing my natural pioinpness of body,
my skin got very' yellow in color and was
blotched w.tli brown patches. In the
morning the rusty taste in my mouth made
rue fei i sick, and there was white fur over
my longue. Ther e was a sharp pain in the
back of my neck and a singing in my ears,
a sort of buzzing that hardly ever left me.
Wind on the stomach was another source of
annoyance. There were muscular pains in
my arms, and at times in the palms of my
hands and soles of my feet a tingling,
pricking sensation, as though they were
going to sleep. My eyes were affected, I
am sure they sank back in my head quite
an inch, and the sight became blurred and
misty with little stars dancing before me.
Sometimes a feeling like a veil falling would
come down over my head and face and creep
to my shoulders, a kind of dead ache, as
though all that part of my body was losing
life—an indescribably horrible feeling,* I
am naturally of a lively disposition and
cheerful in thought; but now I was utterly
tired of my life. If it had not been for
thoughts of my family I would have
welcomed death. And my imagination was
so worked up that I had only to hear
accounts of other people’s maladies to fancy
I was suffering from like complaints in
addition to my own special ailment. My
temper became very irritable; sometimes I
fancy I hardly knew what I was saying ; it
is certain I did not mean all I said. And I
was as easily upset and turned to tears as a
little child, my nerves and impulses being
quite beyond my own control. But while I
tell you of all these smaller things, do not
forget that my great and master trouble all
the time was the fearful pain in the head I
have told you of, that seemed in some way
to be the cause of all my other sorrows.
My last doctor did not speak very hopefully
of my case, he said it would take twelve
months’ tieatment to cure me. And after
my long experience of doctors’ treatment
you may be sure this prospect did not
encourage me. I tried the patent medicines
that are much advertised, but in my case
they failed to do as promised. Then I
chanced to read in the newspaper the re-
port of a cure by Clements Tonic, and I
fancied from what I read that this remedy
might suit my case. I purchased a bottle
of Clements Tonic, and it did me so much
good I bought another ; and it was after
this second bottle that the dreadful pain in
my head went right away, and that I began
to care for my meals and get sleep at night.
Then all the troubles I have told you of
melted away one after the other, like ice
melts under the sun on a warm day, so did
all my distressing symptoms dissolve in the
healing effects of Clements Tonic. I can
not over pia’se Clements Tonic for what it
has done for me ; there is no doubt it was
the one thing that had been wanted during
all my sickness, and the finding of it at lasD
saved my reason if not my life. I know
another case in my own family where
Clements Tonic wiought another cure as
surprising as my own, so that I have double
proof that my faith in Clements Tonic and
its wonderful powers is well founded.”
“ I should like to be allowed to report
your case, Mrs. Hill,” said the reporter
interrogatively, for it will make yet another,
and not the least important, of the mighty
volume of testimonials ga'heied by Clements
Tonic.”
“ I am sure you are quite welcome. * Out
of a full heart the tongue speaketh.' If I
have sa ! d much it is because I feel much,
and I shall only he too g ad if what 1 have
sa’d leaches an ' convince s some person w ho
suffered as I Miff- red. So publish it as n i c i
as you think advisable.”

THE
BEST FOOT
FOREMOST
Is an old saying frequently heard at
home, but how many people have a
“best foot’ which they care to put
forward ? Character is often revealed
by the shape or condition of a shoe.
Now you can always distinguish the
“HERZ” shoe, because its wearer is
never ashamed of it. One has a feeling
of being “well-dressed ’ if the “HERZ”
shoe is part of our outfit. The reason is
not far to seek :
PERFECT SHAPE,
which is never lost in wear.
BEST LEATHER.
The Finest Quality that can be
procured.
ABSOLUTE EASE
and comfort in all weathers.

The Age (Melbourne), 24th October, 1900 “The results of the investigation of its affairs for the quinquennium ending the 31st December last show that the society is in a very sound position.”
