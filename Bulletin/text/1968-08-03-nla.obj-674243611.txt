Musi: be a link missing here.
Any area of your business relying on
"blotter calculation"? Then, frankly, you
have a link missing, A vital link in a
system planned not only to cut out such
risky "blotter calculations", put to bring
you a dramatic increase in over all effici-
ency and hence contribute to a greater
profitability.
For instance, our experts can after
a fact-finding survey plan a Link-
System for you in which you link a
Remington Calculator to a Remington
accounting machine linked to a Rem-
ington Rotaprint.
Even with the basic system you would
be in an advantageous position of being
able to calculate, handle all book-keeping
details, typing, and at the same time
print all necessary documents even
in colour.
Get the idea? And whatever Link-
System you may need, we also guarantee,
without cost to you, to train your staff
(including EDP people) to efficiently
operate that system. Your enquiry will
be given our experts' complete concen-
tration. And security. All obligation-free
of course.

FOOTLING
WE HAVE just come across an item
which we feel some enterprising Mel-
bourne football club should add to
the beanie caps, sweaters and scarves,
streamers and rattles which make up
the enthusiastic fan’s kit. It is a book-
let, brought out by the University of
Sydney Australian Language Research
Centre, called “The Terminology of
Australian National Football, Part 1:
A-C,” by Robert D. Eagleson and Ian
McKie.
The “Part 1: A-C” implies that
there are at least another seven to
come and we shall be waiting for
them right through to “Up there,
Cazaly.” There is nothing we like
better than the unconscious humor of
the scholar bringing the weight of
his learning to bear on some everyday
subject.
Mr. Eagleson and Mr. McKie sent
out a questionnaire to officials, players,
and supporters of the game. They
have not turned up any new or witty
terms, but, then, they are only at C so
far, and they admit they did not get an
overwhelming response. The net result
is about what a sporting writer would
turn up from memory with half an hour
at his typewriter. (Why, if they want to
do language studies, doesn’t someone
have a go at sports writers’ prose with
particular references to banner head-
ings? There is a subject.)
However, the footnotes and com-
ments, making simple matters sound
difficult, make the booklet worth
reading. On the word “Afield” they
quote the “Sunday Mail,” May 22,
1965, P. 63: “Graham Cooper was
best defender afield,” and comment:
“Seven informants felt that the term
is used more by sports writers and
commentators than by players and
supporters. A variant which seemed
popular with the informants was ‘on
the ground.’ ”
But what touched our heart was a
footnote: “We recognise that comple-
tion of the questionnaire would have
been demanding in time, and could
well have occupied 12-15 hours.
While, unfortunately, there is no way
of reducing the size of the task, this
no doubt deterred some from ever
finishing it.”
If a couple of other language
scholars are at this moment looking
for a subject for a thesis, we recom-
mend them to send a questionnaire to
footie fans who failed to fill out the
12-15-hour questionnaire, asking them
what they said when they received it,
and what they did with it.
TRIAL BY "TIMES"
A CURRENT COURT CASE in
Britain has caused judges to talk of
“trial by television.” A man convicted
of fraud was interviewed before his trial
by David Frost. At the unsuccessful
appeal Lord Justice Salmon said: “This
court hopes that no interview of this
kind will ever again be televised. Trial
by television cannot be tolerated in a
civilised country.”
At the end of a lengthy report on
the appeal, “The Times,” London,
writes:
“While the Court of Appeals was
considering Dr. Savundra’s case, Mr.
Frost was hitting a cricket ball at a
match between a Kent XI and a
Surrey XI in Mote Park, Maidstone.
The match was for the benefit of John
Edrich (Surrey) and Colin Page
(Kent).
“ ‘I cannot say anything about Lord
Justice Salmon’s comments until I have
sat down in some quiet corner and
read what he has said,’ Mr. Frost de-
clared.
“Later, wearing a grey suit and pin-
striped shirt, he took the arm of a
blonde and drove back to London in
a blue Triumph Herald car.”
A blonde? A blue Triumph Herald?
A pinstriped shirt? Playing cricket? If
all that isn’t trial by “The Times”
we don’t know what is.
THE RECENT PAST
AUSTRALIAN SOIL may not conceal
the submerged romance of lost civilisa-
tions, but archaeologists are now find-
ing plenty to study in unearthing the
remnants of time not long gone. They
used to ignore the more recent past to
look further back into Aboriginal his-
tory, but now they are also interested
in the everyday life of the Australian
settlers of the last century and the
industrial development of that period.
Jim Allen, of the ANU’s Department
of Pre-History, is excavating a British
military post at Port Essington, near
Darwin, and during the past year
Sydney . University students have been
excavating a site at Irrawang, in the
Hunter Valley.
Irrawang was the home of James
King, a rugged individualist who
migrated to Sydney in 1800, setting
himself up as a merchant and land
agent in King Street. He wrote con-
tinually to the Government requesting
grants of land or special concessions to
advance his money-making schemes
and received a grant of 920 acres at
Irrawang, near Raymond Terrace,
where he grew grain and raised cattle.
In 1830 he set up a threshing mill for
Sydney University archaeology students
digging in the Hunter Valley, New
South Wales
the Hunter, and two years later
planted an experimental vineyard at
Irrawang, producing his first wine a
few years later.
When he couldn’t interest the Gov-
ernment in a plan to make glass from
sand deposits he found near Watson’s
Bay he gave up his Sydney business
and took up residence at Irrawang,
developing the vineyards and a pottery.
The students, directed by Mrs. Judy
Birmingham, senior lecturer in archae-
ology at the university, have been using
the pottery site as a training dig, dur-
ing which they have produced almost
enough finds to fill a room. The best
is now on exhibition at the Fisher
Library. Among them is one complete
piece, a ceramic bottle, which is re-
markable for the fact that it would
look unremarkable in any modern gift-
shop window.
Other broken pieces on display indi-
cate that the originals would also look
at home in anybody’s Elizabeth David
kitchen. James King, whose aim was
to make householdware more cheaply
than the prices at which it could be
imported from England, might have
been doing quite nicely today if he
set up shop again in King Street.
Among the pieces of pottery, a few

buttons have emerged, and some
decorative moulds imported from
pottery centres in Staffordshire. These
are tiny faces, one of them in Greek
classical mood, the other, as someone
at the exhibition put it, like the man
in the “Your shout —it’s Red Mill
Rum” ad.
The students have also found bricks,
nails, and pieces of clay pipe, all of
which are being analysed for informa-
tion about the pottery’s construction.
They’ve been helped in their research
by two Raymond Terrace residents,
Mr. and Mrs. James Blundell, who
once lived on the site and can
remember the building’s destruction.
The students have been assiduously
interviewing Mr. and Mrs. BlundeH
about the building’s shape and its con-
tents.
“When we went there, all we could
see were piles of bricks covered with
brambles,” M.A. student Anne Bick-
ford said. “We didn’t know what we’d
find, except there were rectangular
depressions in the ground which helped
us pick out a plan of the house.”
The site is dug in layers and all finds
are progressively recorded. Now the
students fear that amateurs will plunder
the site, destroying all the painstaking
effort. “A lot of people seem to think
we keep these things for ourselves, and
they get the idea they should have a
few pieces, too, for their mantelpieces.
They don’t seem to realise it all ends
up in a museum as public property.”
The National Trust is showing its
interest in industrial archaeology by
forming a new committee dealing in
an advisory capacity with old industrial
buildings. “Where possible, we’d like
to preserve the old equipment on the
site rather than taking it off to a
museum somewhere,” the Trust’s assis-
tant director, John Morris, said.
A NICE BIT OF ART
WE HAVE vivid memories of the early
art exhibitions by Mr. Barry Humphries.
Mostly they were circa 1958-61. There
were his saucescapes, his piescapes, fork-
scapes, and shoescapes. There was one
exhibition where all the pictures were
created out of pie and tomato sauce.
One piescape was titled: “I Was Eating
a Pie and I Coughed.” There was one
tremendous advantage about piescapes
and cakescapes, he “Said. Unlike other
examples of modern art, they couldn’t
possibly last longer than a week. Then
there were his shoescapes, pictures made
out of shoes, “a highly polished form
of art.” We remember a particularly
regrettable sculpture, a pair of football
boots filled with custard and titled “Pus
in Boots.”
Picasso had his blue period, when he
was almost traditional, then he moved
forward into his more modern periods.
The metamorphosis of Mr. Humphries
is in the other direction. 'As he admitted
on television the other night: “You
know, at heart I am really a conserva-
tive.”
Last week he presented an exhibition
titled “Ten Little Australians,” portraits
of Sir Robert Menzies, John Gorton,
Billy Hughes, Ben Chifley, Arthur
Fadden, John Curtin, Andrew Jones,
Arthur Calwell, Linda Agostini, and
Willy Weeties. They are all large,
mostly in ink and wash, with vivid use
of color, skilful in likeness, with not an
over-extravagant use of caricature.
The detail is often interesting. If you
look closely at the picture of Sir Robert
you find that his face is composed
entirely of little red pigs. Sir Arthur
Fadden is wearing a suit made out of
a real piece of chalk-stripe worsted. “A
very expensive picture,” said Mr. Hum-
phries.
Many at the opening had never heard
of Linda Agostini, “the pyjama girl,”
victim of one of Australia’s most
bizarre murders. Her picture was sur-
rounded with striped woollen pyjama
material. “I thought of using the exact
silk material in which her body was
found, but that might have been a bit
sick,” he said.
His picture of Willy Weeties is
inspired by the 1925 Weeties packet,
which had' the marvellous concept of
infinity, Willy Weeties holding a packet
of Weeties depicting Willy Weeties
holding a packet depicting . . .
The best picture is of Andrew Jones,
a richly beaming, superbly sure-of-him-
self Andrew Jones. He is also wearing
his own tie, that of the North Adelaide
Football Club. “Painted from the life,”
said Humphries. “A nice fellow, really,
but when I met him he said, ‘You’ve
had your hair cut.’ Rather rude, I
thought. So you will note this picture
is of the balding Andrew Jones with re-
ceeding hairline. You will notice a flash
of lightning there, I don’t think Andrew
got the significance of that.”
The exhibition was in the Myer
Mural Hall. As Humphries pointed out,
this was one of the grand old Mel-
burnian restaurants to be put on a par
with the Russell Collins and the Wattle.
Particularly he admired the marvellous
old murals by Napier Waller. “The
Myer Mural Hall,” said he, “is Mel-
bourne’s Sistine Chapel.”
Someone suggested to him that the
Mural Hall might be converted to
straight-out Myer selling-space. He
went quite white and said: “That’s
most shocking news I’ve" heard all
morning.”

NOBODY COULD PAINT
COWS BETTER
THAN SCHELTEMA
LAST WEEK, the Bulletin had a story
on “Playing the Art Market,” but could
one tell you about Melbourne’s Julian
Sterling? On July 19 he followed the
Barry Stern idea and he took a full-
page advertisement in the “Herald,”
“I decided to exhibit — they'll bring
higher prices!”
an exercise that must have cost him
around $2225.
It was on page eight, and one almost
dashed past, thinking it was an every-
thing-must-go affair for - Myers and
Buckleys. It was headed “Australian
Art Treasures for sale now. Southern
Cross Galleries. By far the most impor-
tant and valuable collection ever offered
for sale by any gallery in Australia.”
Heading the ad he had Dobell
“Scene on the Sydney Harbor” $20,000;
Drysdale “The Willy Willy” $15,000;
“Mother and Child” $16,000; Nolan
“Ned Kelly in the Deserted Township”
$9000; “The Victim of the Drought”
$6500, and it went on with a list of
Streetons, Roberts, McCubbins, Hey-
sens, Gruners, Ashtons, Bunnys, Lind-
says, Blamire Youngs, Gills, and von
Guerards.
Your correspondent waited a week,
and then investigated. Kym Bonython’s
palace is in a side street in Paddington,
Rudy Komon, you might say, is also
in the cast-iron end of Paddo, but Julian
Sterling is in the lower plaza of the
Southern Cross Hotel.
He is between a boutique and a
jeweller, and underneath a bowling
alley. He is one of the new breed, an
out-and-out art dealer, not exactly an
art director. There is a subtle differ-
ence. An art director puts on shows,
new exhibitions by artists, but Julian
Sterling might never see an artist. He
has a much better chance of meeting
with the well-tailored, unbearded sober
gentlemen from trustee companies, who
are disposing of estates. He just buys
and sells pictures.
I arrived at the • same time as a
group of ladies. One said: “Ho-ho,
where do we get our catalogues?” And
she had her two bob ready to drop in
the dish. Her eye was roving also, no
doubt for the glasses of Wynvale, but
there is no claret at the Southern Cross
Galleries, and no catalogues, and the
prices are clearly pasted on the frames.
Like $20,000 for the Dobell.

On the gentle art of port sipping
There’s a revolution happening in
Europe particularly England
right now. The traditional picture of
a port drinker as a cantankerous old
gouty club dweller is going . . . going
. . . gone. Because the young world
has discovered port. And, what’s
more, the sophisticated young men
and women of Britain have made
Port their favourite drink. It’s not
hard to understand why. And I
believe this will happen here, too,
particularly when there are so many
very good ports available at quite
reasonable prices (our Royal Reserve
Port costs about 80c sometimes
less and is an excellent port.) Why
should you sip a port ? my answer
is that any wine that takes as long to
make as a good port, deserves to be
approached with respect. And sipped
gently and enjoyed to the last sip.
Especially with a dry biscuit before
going to bed.
On the styles of white
table wines.
Notwithstanding the number of dif-
ferent wine brands available, in
Australia we have a wide range of
white table wine types from which to
choose. I would like to quickly enu-
merate them, and briefly describe
the differences so you will have a
better idea of what the names mean
next time you buy a white wine. (Be-
cause I know them best, I have based
these descriptions on the Dalwood
range, but what I say can be broadly
applied to white wines generally).
Dalwood Riesling is light and re-
freshing with a grapey, crisp finish.
Hock is similar, but with a more pro-
nounced bouquet and flavour.
Chablis has a tangy, flinty, character,
while White Burgundy is soft and full
bodied. Other white table wines are
Moselle (like Eden Valley Moselle)
which is light and delicate with a
trace of natural grape sugars, and
Sauterne which is sweeter. If you
like Riesling, you should really try
Minchinbury Rhine Riesling. This is
different to ordinary rieslings,
as it is made from the Rhine
Riesling grape which gives
this wine a pronounced
fruity -flavour that places it
in a class of its own.

in his fifties. He has been in the busi-
ness only four years. He was a company
director who had his own collection, and
then he decided to branch out and do
what he “always wanted to do.” He
agreed it was unnerving at first. Per-
haps it would be easier to set out in
competition against Drummonds than
to part out with cash to fill one’s win-
dow with Drysdales and Nolans.
He has made headlines on several
occasions. In 1966 there were com-
plaints about an “obscene” picture in
his window. The Vice Squad hurried
down and took photographs. It was
“Bacchanalian Festival,” a marvellous
vintage Norman Lindsay, filled with
big, dairy-fed Lindsayish girls and
boys having a jolly good time. The
publicity was splendid, and the pic-
ture sold for $7OO to a man who was
opening a hotel restaurant at Bent-
leigh. One hopes the bacchanalian
festival is going fine out there. He
has also been in the news for selling
Drysdale’s “The Cricketers” for
$16,000 in February, 1966, and again
to Barry Stern in Sydney, last May, for
$40,000.
After a week of the sale, Julian
Sterling had sold four pictures, in-
cluding a Heysen for $3OOO. But what
of the big ones, the Dobells, the
Drysdales, the Nolans, were they
hanging fire? Mr. Sterling smiled. “I
have some people very interested in
the Dobells and the Drysdales. You
have to appreciate,” he said, “when
the prices get around the $20,000
mark it takes time. They come back
to the gallery four or five times, think
about it, look at the stockmarket,
at how Western Mining is doing. It
takes weeks.”
And who were these people? Direc-
tors who wanted something fancy for
the boardroom? No, the big com-
panies usually were not adventurous.
The big buyers were private collec-
tors, often men who were doing well
on the stockmarket. Mostly, they
were from Sydney and Melbourne,
and Sydney would have the slight
edge. Melbourne buyers tended to be
slightly more traditional than Sydney.
And was the art market beating the
sharemarket? He said paintings of
various artists had gone up five, six,
and seven times in the past five years.
He felt they were pacing BHP shares.
In the contemporary market he
gives us this hit parade of gilt-edged
stocks, roughly in order: Drysdale,
Nolan, Dobell, Arthur Boyd, Black-
man, Tucker, Perceval, and Ray
Crook. Hans Heysen is good, his death
hasn’t made that much difference. A
Heysen that fetched $lOOO five years
ago would make $7OOO. Buckmasters
also are worth money, but, according
to Julian Sterling, they have to be
vintage Buckmasters. His recent works
are not so saleable.
“But do you know the pictures
which are best of all for my business?”
he said. “The Heidelberg School.
There’s a general swing away from
abstract paintings. Pop, op, and all
that is finished. The pictures that will
fetch good money are by Streeton,
Davies, Conder. Streetons will go as
high as $20,000. Even the lesser, not
so well-known painters of the period
are being sought after, like J. W.
Curtis and J. Scheltema. Nobody in
Australia could paint cows better
than Scheltema.”
Lie had a large Schdtema on show,
but your correspondent felt the cows
were of an indiscriminate breed and
the picture would have had a better
chance if they had been class Angus
or Herefords. And I pointed out that
I preferred the top condition of the
pink flesh displayed in “Bacchanalian
Festival.”
“Yes,” sighed Julian Sterling, “that
was a good picture, I’d buy it back
now for double the price. Actually, 70
percent of my pictures I would buy
back. Everything is going up.”

A NERVOUS, RESTLESS
WEEKEND AWAY
FROM IT ALL
THERE’S THIS ad in the “New
Yorker” saying what fun it is to drive
through Britain’s countryside, and when
Bobbie sees it he nearly faints. They
have used his older-than-Moses cottage
to illustrate it, and, moreover, identi-
fied it with “a corner of Cookham, a
Thames-side town about 30 miles from
London.” No one asked if they could,
of course. He might’ve been walking
through his funny, lopsided porch in
the nude when they took the picture,
for all anyone cared. Anyway, some-
one on television follows up this joy
of driving through Britain, and now
Bobbie’s house and Cookham is inun-
dated with trippers.
How wise, says Lord Snowdon, who’s
been there, how wise to have a peaceful
retreat from the restless, nervous world
of high tension which is London ... it
is Saturday and Bobbie’s guests with
pre-lunch Pimms are in the garden
enjoying bell practice emanating from
the church next door. This church has
been made famous not only by the
paintings of Sir Stanley Spencer, born
and buried in Cookham, but also by
Bobbie’s set, who return to London
saying it is unbelievable, bell practice
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and,
naturally, the full bit on Sunday, and
a clock which strikes every hour on the
hour, including night-time.
The guest-room is all gables and
chintzy wallpaper, and equipped with
everything, including tartan velvet-
lined eyeshades to induce quick
slumber, and green-leather, gold-
embossed pad enclosing printed forms

such as snob spotters’ guide, “Elegant

The sensation at 7 a.m., Sunday, is
fantastic: a kind of grand prix-cocktail
party coming right through Bobbie’s
satin-edged blankets. Lunch is served
and everyone says they hope the ghost
who’s supposed to haunt the house
doesn’t appear as well. Legend has it
the poor wretch was walled up alive
by her father, the bishop, for refusing
to join a holy order. No one has actu-
ally seen her, but Bobbie says some
of his guests have felt her walk past.
And after coffee laced with brandy,
which is the new chic way of serving
liqueurs in England, you know, a table-
spoonful per pot is so much more
economical than the old way, what’s
on the cards is some strenuous exercise.
With thousands of trippers on the
river, or walking the banks, being
careful to avoid trestle tables laden
with sausages and cold mash, the
children—Ah the dear children scream-
ing and shouting, the dogs, the prams,
the sexual activities of the uninhibited
and so on. Or through the village itself
which is building up nicely with a
traffic jam of cars and coaches, going
on to other nearby village attractions
such as Bray where the Queen lunched
eight crowned heads for Princess
Alexandra’s wedding Bobbie knows
it all, or stopping for tea en route for
the Stanley Spencer Gallery.
Gloria, one of the custodians, is in
here now in her twinset and pearls,
saying her piece: “Not Turner, not
Constable, not any other English genius
has a memorial gallery of his works in
the village of his birth ” which she has
taken from the gallery’s current news-
letter. which in turn was taken from
the “Observer.” Gloria reckons on
10,000 visitors a year and today is
petitioning for signatures to stop a plan
to dig up 1000 acres of gravel between
here and Maidenhead. If it goes ahead,
she says, there will be one gravel lorry
per minute passing through Cookham
for the next 20 years.
Another attraction is the last day of
swan-upping: a yearly ceremony con-
ducted by Her Majesty’s swankeeper,
Fred Turk, in ox'der to sort the royal
swans from the rest. Due to some con-
fusion in time-keeping Bobbie’s guests
miss this, but next day Fred says they
didn’t miss much. He only upped 40
swans the entire week on account of
bad weather and high flood. . He could
safely say it was the worst swan-upping
in living memory and hardly worth re-
moving the mothballs from his lovely
red uniform.
However, there is tea on the lawn
with cucumber sandwiches and
meringues, accompanied by church
bells, followed by some sharp garden-
ing and half-an-hour at the boozer to
catch up on gossip from The Cough,
a lady with pronounced smoker’s

Ross Campbell
TO GET ON IN THE
WORLD, SEEK
SAFETY IN NUMBERS
A MAN who finds, or tries to find,
jobs for university graduates in Britain
was interviewed last month by a news-
paper. He stressed that the chances of
getting a good job were much better
if the graduate knew some mathematics.
As he put it, “numeracy is more sought
after than literacy.”
This is good news for the numerate,
bad news for the merely literate. It
supports the opinion loudly proclaimed
by Professor Marshall McLuhan that
literacy is on the skids. It will increase
the feelings of inferiority among those
of us who are literate but innumerate,
or only semi-numerate.
I once passed the Intermediate Cer-
tificate exam in arith, alge, and geom,
so I am not totally innumerate. I used
to be able to do sums; but they were
unsophisticated sums, not the kind you
see on blackboards in TV programs like
“The Outer Limits.” The limitation of
my Inter sums was that things did not
change in them the trains always
travelled at a uniform speed, the price
of fish remained steady at 2/- a lb.,
every boy ate the same number of
apples per week.
I never made the breakthrough to
the exciting world where the speed of
trains varies, the price of fish fluctuates,
and the appetites of boys are subject
to alteration without notice the world
of the calculus. Its mysteries were pene-
trated only by the superior beings who
took mathematics for the Leaving.
Since that time I have felt an envi-
ous respect for all persons able to use
the sign J . This is the magic symbol
which masterminds write on black-
boards in TV programs. It is the key
which opens the door to privileged tech-
nocratic careers. J is the exclusive
club-badge of the numerates.
Despite my subnumeracy, I was for
a time in youth a teacher of arithmetic.
By influence I had obtained the post of
junior divinity and mathematics master
at a small boarding school in the rain-
soaked English Midlands. I did quite
well at the divinity I gave the boys
good popular stories from the Book of
Genesis. But I found teaching arith-
metic a more difficult task.
One of my pupils was a quiet, well-
behaved boy named Hickman. On the
first morning I said: “We’ll run over a
few tables for a start. What are six fives,
Hickman?”
“81, sir,” he replied smartly.
“No, six fives are 30,” I said. “And
what are seven fives?”
“30, sir.”
“No, seven fives are 35. Please remem-
ber that. What are five sevens?”
“81, sir.”
“No, no,” I said. “Five sevens are
35, the same as seven fives. It doesn’t
matter if you turn the numbers back
to front. Five sevens or seven fives,
they come to the same thing. Do you
understand that, Hickman?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Good. Well, let’s try some more.
Eight fours?”
“81, sir.”
“No. Eight fours are 32. Six nines?”
“32, sir.”
“Why did you say that, Hickman?”
“I thought you were turning ’em
back to front again, sir.”
“I was not. Six nines are 54. What
are seven nines?”
He was silent for some time.
“Come on, Hickman,” I said.
“You’re holding up the class.”
“I’ve forgotten what you asked me,
sir.”
I repeated the question: “What are
seven nines?”
“You don’t mean nine sevens, do
you, sir?” he said with a cunning look.
“Yes, you can call it nine sevens
if you like.”
“81, sir!” he said triumphantly.
Hickman’s lack of handiness with
numbers may have been due in part
to the primitive teaching methods of
the time. But I doubt whether modern
instructors, Cuisenaire rods and all,
could have done much better with him.
In a world that increasingly rewards
numeracy, the lot of the Hickmans is
hard.
I picture the Arts graduate of a few
years hence at the university employ-
ment office.
“I can write Latin elegiacs,” he
pleads. “I have won spelling bees. I
have completed a thesis on symbolism
in the later works of Henry James.”
“But can you use J ?”
“N-no, I’m afraid I can’t.”
“A pity. The only vacancy we have
for innumerates this week is on exca-
vation work for the Water and
Sewerage Board.”

HOW TO WITHDRAW FROM THE FUTURE
Comment by‘Observer’
IF THE Prime Minister still has any
doubts about whether it is true that
the Americans want Australia to play
an active, independent role in South-
East Asia, all he has to do now is to
read last week’s newspapers. Mr.
William Bundy, representing the State
Department, put it on public record
when he told the House of Representa-
tives Appropriations Sub-Committee:
“We do not intend to undertake any
new commitments in regard to Malaysia
or Singapore or replace the activities
undertaken by the British . . . We have
made it very clear that Australia and
New Zealand must play the external
role there, and that we do not propose
to do so.”
It was one of the most embarrassing
features of Mr. Gorton’s distrust of his
own External Affairs Department that
he simply did not take their word for it
that it has been the American attitude
for some time that Australia should do
more off its own bat in its own region
of the world. He has been privately
assured that this is so. Now he has been
publicly assured that this is so. It is to
be hoped that he will now act as if it is
so, along with all those critics of com-
mitment to Malaysia and Singapore
who go on talking about it as if this
American attitude did not exist, and as
if Australia had simply to work out a
perfect policy of its own, with no possi-
bility of inconvenience, and all bets
hedged.
Even if this declared American policy
did not exist, one could have invented
it on grounds of both morality and
expediency. Professedly, almost every-
one in the Federal Parliament believes
in the American alliance. But on our
receiving end of it, what the American
alliance means, basically, as a pledge
that could be redeemed, is that America
would be ready to make sacrifices for
the sake of Australia. Australia has
shown itself ready, in Vietnam, to make
sacrifices for the sake of American
policy (and it is on this issue that our
political parties split). But, even when
this is reconciled with a belief that, over-
all, the Americans have been right in
Vietnam, it would seem not only inex-
pedient but immoral that Australia
should take toward its South-East Asian
neighbors an attitude of I’m all right,
Jack. If we were to withdraw to Fort-
less Australia and say to hell with our
neighbors, this would mean that while
on the one hand we expected America
to help us, because it is richer than we
are, on the other hand we would refuse
to help countries that are poorer than
we are.
Questions as to the form of help, or
likely results, are another matter. Natur-
ally, decisions of this kind should be
made by summoning whatever ration-
ality is available. But that involvement
of any kind is questioned as now
happens on both the left and the right
of our political system is a symptom
of various kinds of immorality and/or
imbecility.
It made a pleasant change that it
was the Leader of the Opposition who
has spoken the greatest sense on this
subject lately (as reported in The
Bulletin last week). And what was most
welcome about Mr. Whitlam’s speech
was that he seemed to be partly con-
cerned with foreign policy as a force
determining the kind of nation we are.
He was right when he said that foreign
policy is concerned not merely with
the security and survival of our nation,
that it is also concerned with the quality
of the nation we wish to build. He was
right when he said: “An isolationist
Australia would be rich, selfish, greedy,
racialist, and reactionary.”
What he might have added is that
this is the way some of the Right-wing
retractionists would like it, and that
this is the way some of the Left-wing
retractionists would prefer it.
An Australia that withdraws itself
from its geographical environment is
an Australia that withdraws itself from
the future, and that, finally, also with-
draws itself from the world’s sympathy.
A second-rate suburban civilisation
mildly prospering by living on the in-
genuity of more innovatory societies,
it would be merely a forgotten province
of the West, an insignificant left-over.
Our hold on the future cannot be, as
it can be for Canada, as a first-class
technological or technocratic society
unless we revolutionise our education
system: but both history and geography
have given us the chance to play a
unique role in two other great move-
ments of the future the relations
between the rich and the poor nations
and the relations between the races. It
is by playing a role in these movements
and probably only by playing a role
in these movements that, by the acts
of redefinition implied in policy and
action, we can convincingly redefine
ourselves as a nation.
For this purpose we should live with
hope, as well as fear. For nations, as
for individuals, it is wise to contemplate
the possibility of catastrophe, but it is
unrealistic to contemplate nothing but
catastrophe. To see South-East Asia
exclusively in terms of a threat and to
think of it in nothing more than the
language of strategy would be to
imprison ourselves in a cage of fear.
If things went well while we had
allowed only for their going badly, we
would have a strident irrelevancy. If
we fled from South-East Asia, and
things went badly (if, for example, the
Americans said to hell with us, too),
we might have ourselves to blame.
WHAT DR. COOMBS' AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL
SHOULD DO
Comment by Denis O’Brien
THEATRE IS NOT dead or dying; it
is alive and well somewhere in England
and the United States and France and
Germany and everywhere that civilised
people aspire to extend a limited vision
of life. Contrary to all manner of glib
assumptions, theatre is even surviving
in Australia, despite such disadvantages
as a lack of leadership, no sense of
compelling adventure, and no en-
spiriting tradition. It could go on sur-
viving without any of these to the
extent that Australia could always say
it has a dramatic theatre in much the
same way that it has wombats and
koalas. But the vague, fragmentary
pattern of theatre here contributes to
the incompleteness of the Australian
society. Theatre is the mother of the
arts, and, with sustenance, is capable of
creation that enriches the whole cul-
tural family. Without a recognisably
sturdy dramatic theatre movement the
other arts are like satellites aimlessly
revolving around an empty hub.
That might sound like empty rhetoric,
but it is difficult now to add anything
in support of the Australian theatre’s
long cry for help that doesn’t appear
to be extravagantly abstract. The Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust the theatre’s
only hope of stimulus in the last decade
has so shamefully neglected the
fundamental values of a dramatic
theatre movement that it has become
necessary to spell out emphases in each
restatement of the case simply because
deaf ears are beginning to seem like
happy ignorance. On the chance that
the newly formed Australian Council
for the Arts, chaired by Dr. Coombs,
might also not get the message for all
the noise, it is timely to repeat the
obvious.
If the Australian Council does noth-
ing else but bring an Australian
national theatre into being, then it will
have served its cultural purpose.
Theatre is not an anachronism, and
it’s absurd to try to prove it such by
counting empty seats in Australian
theatres which are presenting anachro-
nistic dramas. Theatre in Australia is
simply waiting to be exploited, wait-


ing for blood through its perishing
jugular, waiting for dynamism. An
Olivier would be useful as a rallying
point, but the Australian Council’s
purse is more practicably potent.
A national theatre complex based on
Sydney and Melbourne is a feasible
project and within the Australian
Council’s range of opportunity. In
considering its obligations to drama
and they must surely have priority
the Council should think of nothing
else. Certainly, it should not waste
time trying to divide its money among
the theatrical mendicants in regions and
suburbs. That will only lead to the
further cultivation of a lot of little
back gardens. Australia needs a big
theatrical front garden, and only a
national theatre and national think-
ing can provide it. It is only then
that theatre here will have an inspir-
ing sense of unity, touchstone, and a
motivation that is more than self-
indulgence.
There are already enough skilled
theatre practitioners in Sydney and
Melbourne to support four national
companies two for touring, two for
interchangeable residence within the
complex, but even if a start was made
by pumping national theatre money
into an incorporation of Sydney’s Old
Tote Company and the Melbourne
Theatre Company, the resulting activity
should be more beneficial than the
jealous and fruitless parochialism we
have now.
One of the commonest arguments
against a national theatre (after citing
the failure of the maladministered
Trust Players) has been that the bricks
and mortar don’t exist to house it. It
was always a specious argument and
there’s even less reason now to waste
time on it. Theatres exist and are be-
ing built in both Sydney and Mel-
bourne. If Britain’s National Theatre
had waited for its own permanent home
it would still be waiting. The quality
of its product has- not been strained
by the disadvantages of the Old Vic
theatre.
After deciding to finance a national
theatre plan, the Australian Council
should leave the implementation of it to
professionals under an administrator.
He’ll need to be a dictator —preferably
a benevolent dictator who knows
his way around the snake pit, but, more
importantly, someone who can excite
the interest and imagination of the
public by providing theatre that
acknowledges the best traditions and
has respect for progressive influences.
Theatre is too readily written off on
the assumption that it is old-fashioned.
On the evidence in theatres overseas
that is palpably untrue. If we get old-
fashioned theatre in Australia it’s be-
cause there’s too much unadventurous,
old-fashioned thinking behind it.
It’s time for a more invigorating
climate, one that will put a spur behind
Australian dramatists, actors, producers,
designers, and audiences. It is time for
a national theatre, and the Australian
Council has the opportunity to bring it
about.
IS JACK'S HOUSE FALLING DOWN?
Comment by Alan Reid
AN ORGANISATIONAL chart issued
by the Department of Trade and Indus-
try officially lists Trade Minister John
McEwen as overlord of Shipping and
Transport Minister lan Sinclair, and,
in his capacity of Minister in Charge
of Tourist Activities, Senator Reg
Wright. Fit into this structure the
Ministry for Primary Industry adminis-
tered by Country Party Deputy Leader
Doug Anthony, and the Department of
Customs, over whose policy area of
tariff-making Mr. McEwen has full
control, and that must surely be the
largest administrative empire built up
by any Minister in Australian history.
A pertinent query that arises from
this aggregation of power is whether it
is contributing to the personnel exodus
from the Department of Trade.
In recent times this is the movement
of high-ranking Trade Department
Second Division officers, who represent
the elite of the Commonwealth Public
Service, into private enterprise
• Mr. A. J. Campbell: Colonial Sugar
Refining Co.
• Mr. C. P. Phillips: The Australian
Mining Industry Council.
• Mr. E. P. McClintoc.k: Development
Finance Co.
• Mr. J. P. Kemp: British Tobacco
Ltd.
• Mr. W. S. Lowe: John P. Young and
Associates.
• Mr. B. R. Barry: Irish and Michel-
more, chartered accountants.
• Mr. W. Callaghan: Australian Indus-
tries Development Association.
Some of the reasons why they left
the Public Service are obvious: the
Public Service does not pay the kind
of money that is available from private
enterprise; a high-ranking position in
the Trade Department brings an officer
into contact with the administrators of
private enterprises that are likely to
pay big money; and the talents pos-
sessed by high-ranking Trade Depart-
ment officials are the kind that are
likely to appeal to large businesses.
But these reasons cannot be the com-
plete answer. A whole generation of
comparatively lowly paid public ser-
vants the Wilsons, the Coombs, the
Crawfords, and the Browns stayed
in the Public Service though they were
repeatedly offered jobs outside at much
more than they were getting.
The present head of the Trade
Department, Sir Alan Westerman, has
to my knowledge been offered far more
highly paid jobs than his present one.
His reason for staying on “the satis-
faction of the job” is probably the
explanation for the loyalty of the
Wilson-Coombs-Crawford generation.
Is there these days less “satisfaction
with the job”? If so, why?
For a long time I could never satis-
factorily decide in my own mind which
was the better system the British
one of shifting Ministers frequently
from one department to another so that
a powerful ministerial personality would
not transform his department into a
personal empire or the Australian
system of keeping men in the same
portfolio for long periods.
Nowadays, I am a bit inclined toward
the British system, particularly where
a particularly powerful ministerial per-
sonality is involved.
Mr. McEwen is such a powerful per-
sonality. He has administered the Trade
Department either as the Trade Depart-
ment or in its earlier, less-massive, shape
of the Department of Commerce and
Agriculture since 1949. The tendency
to look upon it as his personal posses-
sion and an adjunct to the Country
Party, which he leads, must be almost
irresistible to a man of his dominating
nature.
Similarly, there must be a tendency
for the Department to supply the
advice that it knows the Minister wants.
Overtones of this came through recently
when the Treasurer, Mr. McMahon,
and Sir Alan Westerman addressed the
Melbourne Chamber of Commerce on
the same day. Their views were dia-
metrically opposed. Mr. McMahon, as
Treasurer, was giving the Government
viewpoint. Sir Alan, a punctilious public
servant, could only have been enunciat-
ing the views of Mr. McEwen, his
Minister.
Prime Minister Gorton was under-
standably irritated. But nothing was
done about it. Nobody, not even a
Prime Minister, interferes with the
political empire McEwen has built.
Other signs that there is restiveness
about the way the Trade Department
is used have also emerged.
Some time ago, after saying that there
was increasing concern in Public Ser-
vice ranks about the use of the Depart-
ment as an extension of the Country
Party secretariat, the ACT Secretary of
the Administrative and Clerical Officers’
Association charged thaf Trade officers
were being pressed to slant economic
reports, especially on devaluation, to-
ward the Country Party line.
Mr. McEwen denied that this was
happening, and I do think that the
public servants got confused between
departmental submissions and minis-
terial submissions to Cabinet, which are
entirely a Minister’s responsibilty and
can ignore, if the Minister so desires,
the advice tendered by his Department.
But the fact that such a charge could
be made suggests resentment within the
Department about the Conutry Party
orientation of its activities.
In moving their Ministers frequently,
the British may lose the value of con-
tinuity of service in a department, but
their system does escape the danger of
a department becoming a Minister’s
personal instrument.

Is Labor moving toward
its last bust-up?
AUSTRALIA
THE TASMANIAN LABOR Premier,
Mr. Eric Reece, has told important
figures in the ALP that he is “not going
to become another Jack Renshaw.”
Rather than let extreme Left-wing ele-
ments in the ALP gradually destroy
Australia’s last remaining Labor Gov-
ernment the Tasmanian ALP might “go
it alone.” To do this, it would have to
break off all relationships with the ALP
Eederal Executive.
The issue threatens to come to a head
at the ALP Federal Executive meeting
in Sydney on August 5. Mr. Reece’s
attitude arises out of the refusal by the
Left Wing-dominated Federal Execu-
tive to accept Mr. R. B. Harradine as
one of its members until he apologises
for suggestions that there were “friends
of the Communists” on the Executive
who would seek his disbarment.
Mr. Harradine has written to the
ALP Federal Executive apologising for,
and withdrawing, this statement. But
four ALP State branches Victoria,
Queensland, South Australia, and
Western Australia have now decided
that Mr. Harradine must also withdraw
and apologise for statements that the
Victorian ALP Executive is under “sub-
stantial” Communist influence, before
re-admitting him to the Federal Execu-
tive. As Mr. Harradine’s charges are
merely a paraphrase of charges already
made publicly by the Opposition
Leader, Mr. Whitlam, Mr. Harradine
has so far refused to withdraw.
Mr. Reece takes the view that the
principle at stake is whether the Tas-
manian ALP branch has the right to
representation at the ALP Federal
Executive by a person properly elected
by the Tasmanian ALP branch under
the rules, or whether a majority of the
ALP Federal Executive-can decide who
will sit on the Executive.
Mr. Reece’s reference to Mr. Ren-
shaw is based on the Right-wing Labor
belief that the decline of the Renshaw
N.S.W. Labor Government dates from
when a Federal ALP Executive com-
mittee, headed by the Left Wing’s ALP
Federal “strongman,” Mr. F. E. (“Joe”)
Chamberlain, marched into N.S.W. with
the objective of forcing the Renshaw
Government to “toe the line” on ALP
Federal policy on State Aid to
denominational schools, to which the
ALP was then Federally opposed.
Mr. Harradine, who, as a member of
the Australian Council of Trades
Unions Interstate Executive, is sched-
uled to attend an ACTU Interstate
Executive meeting in Melbourne on

rTTii . \ ~r, . , .
This would put Mr. Whitlam and
Deputy Parliamentary Labor Leader
Mr. Barnard m the position that they
remained members of an Executive from
which Mr. Harradine had been ejected,
because he supports a viewpoint already
publidy expressed by Mr. Whitlam.
Mr. Barnard is himself a Tasmanian
who supported Tasmania s complete
authority to nominate its deiegates to
the ALP Federal Executive. It is to
avoid these embarrassments that Mr.
Harradine is under pressure not to at-
tend, and to get his branch to send an
alternative delegate.
So far, Mr. Harradine is refusing to
agree to stay away and is being backed
by a majority of the Tasmanian ALP
who can see the destruction of the
Reece Labor Government if Tasmania,
as N.S.W. did, acknowledges the un-
limited authority of the Left Wing-
controlled ALP Federal Executive.
Inflaming the situation further is the
demand from Left Wing sources that
there should be an inquest into “back-
stairs” moves for reconciliation between
a section of the Labor Party and the
Democratic Labor Party. Also certain
to cause trouble is the Chamberlain-
sponsored move to get the ALP Federal
Executive to consider an approach to
the High Court to challenge the legal
validity of Australian intervention in the
Vietnam conflict.
Already both sides are manoeuvring.
A fresh anonymous document has been
circulated in Tasmania, suggesting that
Mr. Harradine is a “DLP plant” and
that Mr. Whitlam has been instructed
by his Caucus to “drop Harradine.”
Meanwhile, in Melbourne, further in-
tensity was added to the nine-month-
long dispute between the power-hold-
ers of the Victorian Labor Party and
the power-holders of the Victorian
Trades Hall Council by the with-
drawal of the local branch of the
Australian Workers’ Union from the
ALP.
Accustomed to playing its cards
closely, the Victoria-Riverina branch
of Australia’s largest union made the
decision quietly in the first week of
July, and confirmed the news two
weeks later.
Although it boycotted the 1965 and
1966 State Party conferences, and was
one of the 16 unions that boycotted
the conference in June, the State
secretary, Mr. H. O. (Bramah)
Davis, said the matter had not been
discussed until the last executive
meeting.
Mr. Davis said there were a dozen
reasons why the union decided to
withdraw support, but the main con-
sideration was the lack of a voice in
the affairs of the Party. “We are a
pretty big and responsible organisation,
and yet when you look at the com-
position of the Victorian branch of
the ALP it is clear that the AWU has
absolutely no representation whatso-
ever.”
He said the Party was in the hands


of people who didn’t understand the
meaning of the ALP. “As far as I
can see there is no possibility of
getting power under the present set-
up.”
The rest of the 16 unions that had
joined the AWU in boycotting the
June conference will not necessarily
join it by withdrawing from the Vic-
torian ALP. Some of them had boy-
cotted the conference, not for political
reasons, but because they had no wish
to sit beside Left-wing unionists who
were, as they put it, “deliberately
wrecking the Trades Hall Council by
refusing to pay their affiliation fees.”
It is for this reason that Party officials
expect only “tempory financial tight-
ness” and no mass exodus from the
Party.
In broad terms, however, the two
disputes are intertwined. While the 27
Left-wing unions that refuse to pay
Trades Hall Council affiliation fees,
amounting to $BO,OOO, claim that they
have insufficient voice in the union
movement’s councils in proportion to
their numbers, the Right-wingers who
do not want to lose control of the THC,
claim that the Left-wing bias of the
Victorian ALP Executive has denied
any representation for their views.
Estimates vary, but eight to ten of
these generally much smaller unions are
said to be considering disaffiliating from
the ALP.
Mr. P. A. Tivendale, of the Pastry-
cooks’ Union, which withdrew affiliation
from the Party in May, put the case for
numbers of unions when he said that
it was pointless to go on paying dues
while the ALP held out no prospects
of success, and while it was basically
comprised of people whose unions were
hostile to the Trades Hall. The levy
could be better used in helping the
THC pay its heavy debts.
Although it is convenient to do so,
the issues cannot fully be categorised
simply into terms of “Left” and
“Right.” Not all the unions on each side
agree precisely about aims and pur-
poses. Personal rancor and distrust
also play a large part in keeping the
battle lines drawn.
The Hospital Employees’ No. 2
branch is seriously thinking of with-
drawing affiliation from the ALP as
well as the THC, in the belief that the
interests of ordinary unionists have little
relation to the Left-Right split. The
union’s secretary, Mr. E. Dixon, said,
“Nobody listens to motions any more.
They vote on who proposes them, not
on what they contain. The average
unionist is not concerned with these
divisions.”
At present there seems to be no solu-
tion to the THC financial worries. Both
groups adamantly maintain their posi-
tions: one demanding greater represen-
tation for the large unions and less for
the small, while the other answers that
change can only occur by amendment
of the THC constitution. It has been
suggested that the dissident 27 might be
deprived of representation at the ACTU
Congress if the THC, as the ACTU
State branch, formally expelled them,
but the unions would still have affilia-
tion with other State branches. Prob-
ably the most that can be expected is a
warning by the ACTU to the unions’
Federal bodies to bring their local
branches into line.
There seems even less possibility of
a solution to the Victorian ALP’s
worries. There has even been talk, fol-
lowing the AWU disaffiliation, of fin-
ancing a rival Labor Party, which the
Trades Hall could endorse, as its con-
stitution gives it power to do. At pres-
sent few seem enthusiastic. Many union-
ists have become apolitical, preferring
to wash their hands of the present
situation and wait till the Left wanes.
Hostility to the DLP is still strong, but
if Tasmania did make a break for it,
it is possible that another Labor Party
might be formed in Victoria.
its taxation system currently geared to
take around 30 percent of national
income, so the natural growth of the
economy could be expected to net it
upward of $720 million extra. In fact,
because such a proportion of the growth
in income is likely to be in the farming
sector, the actual take will be smaller —
perhaps around $650 million. Given
normal loan raisings and Treasury Bill
finance, it will have about $7.2 billion
to dispense.
The Commonwealth won’t, in fact,
be spending quite this amount, because
of the need to steady down the growth
of the economy a little, below the rate
it would expand to if it got the stimulus
of last year’s Budget. Last year, in order
to boost the economy along at a faster-
than-natural rate, the Government went
into extra debt to the extent of $6BO
After the annual juggling exercise ... the Prime Minister with new social welfare
items, the Treasurer confident of growth without new taxes
CANBERRA: THE BUDGET
ELECTION YEAR JOB
FEDERAL CABINET is now in the
middle of its annual exercise in financial
juggling the preparation of the
Budget. The general shape is becoming
clear. It is going to be an election-year
Budget.
Economic analysts inside the Govern-
ment and outside are sure that the year
is going to be one of great economic
growth. Treasurer McMahon is confi-
dent of this, and his Budget will be
financed entirely on the Canberra Gov-
ernment’s natural rakeoff. No tax rises
or increased charges are likely.
The situation can be sketched as fol-
lows. Non-farm production is expected
to grow by close to $2 billion
(Treasury’s billions are $lOOO millions)
in the coming financial year, compared
to $1.7 billion last year. But whereas
the drought took $3OO million off last
year’s growth in the economy, making
it $1.4 billion, the recovery to good
seasonal conditions is expected to add
$4OO million to overall growth. There-
fore, $2.4 billion by value or 11.5 per-
cent, extra resources will be available,
compared to the $1.4 billion, or 7 per-
cent, last year.
The Commonwealth Government has
million. This year, in order to impose
a little restraint, the increase in indebt-
edness is likely to be between $5OO
million and $6OO million. Therefore, the
expenditure side of the Budget is likely
to be between $7 billion and $7.1
billion.
This seems likely to suit Cabinet
Ministers pretty well, as the following
figuring shows:
Payments to the States are by far the
largest single item of Commonwealth
Government expenditure, and Prime
Minister Gorton succeeded well this
year in keeping down the Common-
wealth commitment. At the Premiers’
and Loan Council Conferences he man-
aged to hold payments to the States to
a remarkably low figure. From last
year’s $1635 million in revenue assist-
ance, works and housing moneys, the
payment is to rise by only 6 percent,
or $lOO million. This small rise gives
him tremendous room for manoeuvre in
the rest of his Budget.
Specific-purpose conditional pay-
ments to the States, for which the Com-
monwealth gets the political kudos, can
be expanded very fast. So they will be,
by all the forecasts. In Canberra $427
million has been mentioned as the
likely figure, and this is a 21 percent
increase on last year’s $363 million.
The money will go on universities,


teachers colleges, school science blocks,
libraries, roads, the Ord and other
dams. It may also provide room for one
of Mr. Gorton’s favorite new social wel-
fare items, such as grants to old people’s
homes.
Even with this substantial collection
of projects added in, States’ projects
will cost the Commonwealth only an
extra 8 percent (compared to 8.5 per-
cent last year).
In his National Press Club speech,
Mr. Gorton said that defence spending
would be $1250 million, the extra
money going into equipment already
ordered, mainly the F-llls, which will
be delivered and almost completely paid
for by the end of the financial year.
This is $132 million, or 12 percent,
more than was budgeted in August,
1967.
It is the likely increase in social
services which will stamp the Budget
an election-year job. In the normal
course of events, the bill for social wel-
fare payments would rise from $1295
million by 4 percent to about $1350 mil-
lion. In fact, Mr. Gorton, with the
strong encouragement of the new Social
Services Minister, Mr. Wentworth, is
determined to grant a really generous
increase in pensions.
There is, of course, a strong effort to
keep the figure secret, but it looks as
though it will be about $1.50 a week.
If this is applied to widows as well as
aged and invalid pensioners, it looks
as though the pension bill could be
$lOO million larger. The figure for
social service payments is, therefore,
certain to rise by more than defence
and general payments tp the States. It
could reach $1440 million.
These three-billion-dollar categories
of expenditure take more than half of
the total Budget, and they will cost the
Commonwealth $420 million extra.
For the rest, there is a great hotch-
potch of items, some of which are likely
to be contained, others of which are not.
Not containable this year is depart-
mental administrative 'expenditure. Mr.
Gorton may eventually be able to do
something to improve the efficiency of
the Canberra Government machine, but
there is no sign of it this year. As part
of his politicking with the powerful
cabal of top public servants, he had to
create an extra Department as soon as
he came into the Prime Ministership.
This, and the very-necessary expansion
of the Defence Department, will be
costing money. For these and other
reasons, the Departments will probably
succeed in increasing their appropria-
tion by the 10 percent which has be-
come a regular annual figure. This will
take their total to $415 million.
There are some big savings. The main
Snowy works finish this financial year.
Outlays on this could be down $25
million on last year’s figure. Another
saving will be in civilian aircraft:
Qantas and TAA are having a lull in
their re-equipment program before the
next generation of jet aircraft.
About a week ago there was talk
in Canberra about Mr. McEwen pro-
posing a scheme of direct subsidies for
the wool industry. Now, the story from
several sources is that the Cabinet could
not approve any such scheme, which
would, of course, become enormously
expensive.
Other increased rural subsidies are
on the cards, especially fertiliser
subsidies and dairying. These will favor
the sugar and citrus growers and the
dairymen on whom the Country Party
is based electorally. They will also
help wheat men a little (they use a good
deal of fertiliser in superphosphate),
though they are going to be annoyed at
the greatly reduced support price for
export wheat. There will be a small
expansion of the bounty fund for cot-
ton, even though the Government is
apprehensive of the industry’s future.
By any estimate of the future, Aus-
tralia’s growth industries in the rural
sector are meat and fishing. They are
unlikely to get any substantial increase
in assistance. The reason is that the
Government is tied to the idea that
subsidies are for propping up industries
in trouble, not for speeding the expan-
sion of those with a future.
Prices are probably going to rise by
all of four percent during the course of
this financial year. The Treasury is
working its estimates on a slightly lower
figure, but many of its officials fear that
inflation will be as bad as this estimate.
There are no real resource constraints
yet operating (except in W.A.) to create
inflation, in the view of the Treasury.
Inflation is almost entirely attributable
to excessive wage rises granted by the
Arbitration Commission.
The effects of the Metal Trades
Award have not yet worked their way
through into consumer prices. “It could
be some time before they become appar-
ent,” the Treasury said in their annual
pre-Budget paper on the Australian
economy. “Whatever the time may be
before an increase in costs appears in
final prices, it can safely be assumed
that, in general, prices will rise if an
increase in average earnings is much in
excess of the national average gain in
productivity.” That, according to the
Treasury, has been 2.5 percent. Some
would place the figure higher, at three
percent, but in any case it is clearly far
below the current rise in wage costs
which are being pushed up at six or
seven percent.
The Treasury line is that the only
way it can counter inflation under these
circumstances is to create a whole lot
of unemployment by bringing economic
growth to a halt and creating a reces-
sion. This is obviously not on. If the
Government is to moderate inflation, it
will have to work through the Arbitra-
tion Commission, not the Treasury.
Imports will rise substantially next
year, possibly by more than the $4OO
million estimated increase in exports.
This will leave a wide trade deficit. And
with payments on freight continuing to
grow fast, Australia is certain to run
down its reserves on foreign exchange
this financial year.
The Government is banking on this
loss not being too large. The following
year, 1969-70, should be excellent on
foreign account. According to estimates
by the Melbourne Institute of Applied
Economic Research, imports will fall
back that year by as much as $5OO
million, while exports will rise another
$4OO million, transforming a deficit of
$7OO million into a surplus of $2OO
million. That should be sufficient to
rebuild reserves.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA
HALL'S 100 DAYS
THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN Labor
Opposition must in one sense be pleased
with the Hall Government’s perform-
ance during its first 100 days of office.
Over that period, Parliament sat for a
mere seven days two of them to
defeat the Dunstan Government, two
to pass the Supplementary Estimates,
then three last week, in the beginning
of the debate on the Address in Reply,
the loan estimates, and the Budget.
Last week Opposition Leader Don
Dunstan attempted several times to
introduce electoral-reform measures but
executive matters came first. Premier
Hall finally agreed to let the House
consider electoral reform this week.
You could see the political tempo of
South Australia slow down over the past
three months. The Millicent by-election
was an exception, but this was not
something the Government had wished
on itself. At the Loan Council, Mr.
Hall’s submissions were remarkably
similar to those Mr. Dunstan would
have made, especially in the field of
social services, where he asked for
finance to continue the very policies he
had most criticised the previous Gov-
ernment for maintaining. He then left
for a month-long trip abroad, designed
to assess the kind of competition the
State faces in its search for a broader
industrial base.
Aside from its intransigence on elec-
toral reform, the issue on which the
Hall Government is being most critic-
Hall ... a colorless performance


ally judged is its promise to create a
healthy economic and industrial climate
in the State. Here it has come up
against precisely the same difficulties
that faced the Dunstan Government. A
healthy employment situation in South
Australia depends on the ability of the
State’s consumer industries to sell their
goods interstate, while future industrial
development depends on the State’s
ability to sell itself to foreign indus-
trialists.
The previous Government set up in
the Premier’s Department of In-
dustrial Development specifically to
undertake world-wide and national
promotion of the State’s industrial
potential. On gaining office, Mr. Hall
made the Department a separate port-
folio and followed with several clearly
impractical changes in the structure
of the Department and its associate
Industrial Development Council, which
have reduced their flexibility and
potential effectiveness.
While Mr. Hall was overseas the
unemployment figure in South Aus-
tralia became Australia’s highest,
making nonsense of his election
claim that once in Government he
could “get the State moving again,”
the implication being that somehow
industrialists would respond to pleas
by an LCL Government for more
industry in a way they would not for
Dunstan. In fact, his efforts to vitalise
the industrial and commercial sectors
have lacked vitality.
A comparison must be made. The
first 100 days of the Labor Govern-
ment saw remarkable reform moves
Four types of housing provided for
Aborigines in the Northern Territory
in town planning, social welfare, land
development, lower courts, and social
legislation. The sudden spate of
activity came as a shock to the placid
South Australian citizen who, during
the Playford reign, had come to ex-
pect intermittent industrial advances
but no fundamental changes. It was
a welcomed shock.
Mr. Hall lacks both Playford’s
rugged political strength and Dun-
stan’s professional political intelli-
gence. Even his own Party members
are having second thoughts about how
effective he is as Premier, embarrassed
as they are by his inconsistent public
statements and the generally colorless
performance of his Government. Even
with electoral boundries in their
present form they fear Mr. Dunstan’s
stated intention of bringing down the
Government at the earliest possible
moment. With the metropolitan and
fringe. - area vote r s increasingly
disenchanted by the Government they
see the possibility of Dunstan’s im-
minent return to power. If this occurs
electoral reform will certainly be the
first measure passed.
ABORIGINES
"UNTOLD VIOLENCE"
“AS MUCH OF history has a habit
of repeating itself, we have gone as far
as humanly possible to forcing the
Aborigines to react with untold
violence to our constant oppression.
Only then, possibly, will it be appreci-
ated that within these ‘happy child-like
people’ beats the heart of a man.”
This is the conclusion ANU research
fellow Frank Stevens reached in a
paper documenting the treatment of
Aborigines in the Northern Territory,
up to 1965-66, when the Arbitration
Commission made equal wages possible
for some Territory Aborigines.
“In the Australian environment,” he
says, “it remains to be seen just how
long the agents of the pastoralists will
be able to frustrate the rule of law.
We have seen how they have effectively
avoided the agreements entered into on
their behalf for 20 years and frustrated
the implementation of announced Gov-
ernment policy for another ten. On
the past record of the Government,
there seems little reason to assume that
the condition of Aborigines in the
Northern Territory will be greatly dif-
ferent in 1978 to what it was in 1948.”
If that has overtones of the struggle
for Negro rights in the United States,
the analogy is very much on Mr.
Stevens’ mind as he documents Federal
Government good intentions before the
war, the successes of Aborigines working
for the Army (at lOd a day) in a
variety of occupations, plans to give
them 70 percent of the whites’ wage
after the war (watered down severely
after a conference with pastoralists),
details of the study by Dr. C. M.
Berndt which the pastoralists asked
for but concluded when Berndt looked
too closely into the reasons why native
labor was becoming scarce.
He plots the course of Mr. Hasluck’s
“new deal” by which native stock-
workers’ wages fell from 20 percent
of the white basic wage to 15 percent,
and a Welfare Ordinance (1951) under
which the Welfare Branch “set out to
produce a virtual Doomsday Book of all
Aborigines in the area. Inclusion in this
list, with all its inaccuracies and omis-
sions, was intended to be the foundation
of a colored person’s industrial and
legal rights.” All people so proscribed,
whatever their shades, became Wards
and liable to be paid less.
Stevens says that the Welfare Branch
had the power to negotiate higher wages
for its charges but in no case did so;
rather it approved reductions for
“handicapped” workers. No employer
was prosecuted for failure to provide
even rudimentary accommodation under
the Ordinance; but the stations could
retain up to 90 percent of the trivial
pensions given to indigent Wards in
return for servings of “a hunk of dry
bread, a piece of cooked beef, and a
pannikin of sweetened tea.”
The obvious result, malnutrition, is
part of Stevens’ complaint in consider-
ing evidence given, finally, to the Arbi-
tration Commission: “The view that the
bulk of Aborigines in the north are not
equipped for or disposed to working at
the level of a member of the white
community” and “intelligent parasit-
ism” are contrasted with the observation
that “their energy intake is equivalent
to the lowest 20 percent of the Austra-
lian population, although they are
executing tasks well beyond the endur-
ance of most Europeans.”
Section by section, Mr. Stevens puts
together an indictment of white men’s
despoliation of Aborigines in the
Northern Territory, weighing good
intentions against actual malpractice in
merely affecting to carry them out. So
bad is the indictment that most of his
readers will consider immediately that
it must be heavily one-sided; and it may
well be. But when, in 59 pages, he
assembles such a weight of evidence, not
only against pastoralists but, by exten-
sion, all other Australians, his publica-
tion (“Equal Wages for Aborigines.”
Aura Press. 75c.) calls for more than
casual dismissal.

FISHING
INTRUDERS' PATROL?
IT IS ALL very well of the Common-
wealth authorities to keep on pacifying
an indignant fishing industry with the
promise of yet more legislation to con-
trol sovereign intrusion, but some prac-
tical hints on how it is all going to be
enforced are sadly lacking.
Since February, foreign fishermen
operating within 12 miles of the Aus-
tralian coast became liable for a fine of
$lO,OOO, a year’s jail, and confiscation
of boat, catch, and gear. But the fish-
ing continues and the jails are empty.
The latest upset, last week, involved
some Nationalist Chinese fishing boats
on the Great Barrier Reef. The
Commonwealth reminded the Chinese
Embassy about the punishment that was
liable to be fitted to the crime and the
Embassy promised to do everything
possible to ensure that its nationals’
vessels do not breach the Australian
Fisheries Act.
At the same time, Mr. Gorton prom-
ised further legislation to protect clams,
abalone, and other sedentary sea
creatures (i.e., non-migratory or com-
pletely Australian ones) who have taken
up living quarters on that very vaguely
defined area, the continental shelf. In
other words, for these creatures at least,
fishing rights will be extended to as
far as 200 miles off-shore. And, what
is more, there is a strong body of
opinion which holds that the Gulf of
Carpentaria should and could quite
readily be declared an exclusive Aus-
tralian fishing zone. The prawns that
proliferate there may not be sedentary,
but were it not for the 20 or so Aus-
tralian rivers which flow into the Gulf,
bringing with them millions of tons of
good Australian mud for the prawns to
breed in, then there might be no prawns.
Having extended Australian jurisdic-
tion on fishing rights over such im-
mense new areas, how would it all be
governed? (The Gulf has a bigger area
than Victoria, for instance.) It was a
question which was worrying Premier
Pizzey, of Queensland, last week as the
Chinese gathered Australian clams in
northern waters and well within the 12-
mile limit. Premier Pizzey promptly
telegrammed Mr. Gorton, urging him
to take action to ensure the proper
protection and policing of northern
waters. Representatives- of five Com-
monwealth departments, including
Defence, External Affairs, and Primary
Industry, discussed future action. Mr.
Gorton then telegrammed to Premier
Pizzey: “Extra patrol boats have be-
come available to the RAN and will
allow coverage and frequency of sea
patrols to be increased within Aus-
tralia’s 12-mile exclusive fishing zone.
The RAAF will participate regularly
in patrolling activities, particularly
over northern fishing grounds.”
The Prime Minister was referring
to the 20 new patrol boats ordered
during confrontation with Indonesia on
which delivery is expected to be com- .
pleted within 12 months. At present
the Navy has nine patrol craft. Under
present plans, five will be stationed in
Papua-New Guinea, two in Darwin,
two in Melbourne, two in Jervis Bay,
one each in Brisbane, Perth, and
Westernport, and six in Sydney.
Allowing for two or three of these
craft to be in port for maintenance at
any one time and, say, six in use for
training duty, the maximum available
for fishing-patrol duties would be hope-
lessly inadequate for the 12-mile limit,
let alone an extension of that; assum-
ing, anyway, that the Navy will will-
ingly accept the pursuit of foreign fish-
ing craft as its main occupation. The
present, unofficial view is that the Navy
is willing to help when called upon,
but it doesn’t want to spend much
time doing such things and it is cer-
tainly not going to have its other pro-
grams upset.
The RAAF is probably a more will-
ing and available source of help. Its
aircrews are required to do a certain
number of flying hours each month, and
hunting out foreign fishing boats could
add a point and a. bit of excitement
to the exercise. But how is the huge
cost of such exercises to be apportioned.
Defence would hardly be willing to
go on footing the bill under such new
conditions.
That would probably be a difficult
point for Defence and Primary Indus-
tries to come to an agreement on. It
seems inevitable and proper, anyhow,
that the protection and policing of fish-
ing grounds should be independent of
the Armed Services. The responsibility
of providing a policing force then falls
on the Minister for Primary Industries,
Mr. Anthony. Perhaps he should post-
pone his studies of the breeding habits
of the Carpentarian prawns and con-
sider, rather, how many extra light
aircraft or small patrol boats would
have to be added to a hypothetical
police force should the Gulf be pro-
claimed an Australian fishing ground.

The shape of the coming explosion?
From HARVEY STOCKWIN in Manila
Razak ... held the moderate
line
SLOWLY but inexorably the Philip-
pines-Malaysia crisis gathers heat and
drifts toward some unhappy, possibly
bloodshedding, denouement.
Given the pressures that are building
up and it would seem inevitable that
there must be an explosion • either
the Filipinos find another compelling
and overriding issue, or outside inter-
vention achieves a compromise, or both
sides quickly seek a face-saver, or Presi-
dent Marcos makes a very determined
stand to cool it. Of these, the first
looks unlikely, the second would only
be a few points short of miraculous,
the opportunity for the third appears
past, and in the last case the evidence
for hope is slight.
To be sure, to give the correct Philip-
pines perspective, as always there is no
lack of issues. The Sabah claim has
been competing (successfully) this
week with the latest headlines on the
“peace and order” situation, leaks in
the civil service examination, contro-
versial reorganisation Bills before Con-
gress (of the police and the executive
branch itself), a typhoon, and a Filipino
being shot by a U.S. marine at an
American naval base here. This last
has, of course, great “nationalist” possi-
bilities, but speedy apologies by the
U.S. Ambassador, for one thing, the
fact that such incidents are old hat, for
another, have limited its momentary
potential. Sabah remains the long-term
lead item. Worse than that, it remains
the one issue which, if “properly” ex-
ploited, could divert attention from all
the other issues and pressing internal
troubles. There is no lack of potential
exploiters.
As for the face-saver, that seems
further away than ever. The basic
conditions for it are absent. The “con-
frontation” has still to reach its apogee.
There is a broad lack of understand-
ing in both countries of the other coun-
try’s viewpoints and realities. The
“understanding” that there is can only
therefore support, and is supporting,
completely antipathetic positions. On
the one hand, what Manila sees as the
“controlled Malaysian Press” (it is
really self-controlled by its inability to
take more freedom than the amount
of freedom it is given) is certainly
very good at only presenting the
Malaysian viewpoint and running down
the Filipinos. To my knowledge, not a
single Malaysian journalist has been
sent to the Philippines to report back,
even though several of the papers are
certainly wealthy enough to do so.
Greater regional information remains
a prior but distant goal as well as an
essential prerequisite for greater
regional co-operation. At least some
Filipinos have gone to Malaysia in
(vain) search after pro-Filipino quotes,
while some Malaysian speeches such
as Tan Sri Ghazali’s ending the
Bangkok talks are at least reproduced
in Manila, even though their substance
is ignored. What Kuala Lumpur sees
as the “licentious” Manila Press
(again it is best described as lacking
in journalistic self-discipline in the
search for facts and the choice for
words) has certainly done an excel-
lent job on the Sabah issue of present-
ing a narrow point of view in an
inflammatory way which would have
done credit to a police state.
For the Filipinos, therefore, it was
the Malaysians who made all the dif-
ficulties at Bangkok; it was the
Malaysians who fulminated, criticised,
and irritated; it was the Malaysians
who refused to negotiate, and Ambas-
sador Guerrero was the “hero” who
saved the day for the Philippines by
paying the Malaysians back in the
same supercilious English-English coin,
and before whom the Malaysians re-
treated in high dudgeon and disorder.
Crucially the many doubts raised by
the Bangkok talks in relation to the
Filipino claim have not penetrated at
all. President Marcos can therefore talk
about national honor without any sub-
stantial fear of being checkmated by
accusations of having failed to protect
the national honor sufficiently
Bundy .. . what did he tell
Marcos?
Marcos . .. the national honor
invoked
through thorough preparations in the
first place. Put another way, there are
not lacking those Filipinos who would
dismiss the bulk of The Bulletin’s cover-
age of the Bangkok talks as “Malaysian
and British propaganda.”
In the light of all this dual one-
sidedness, the ever-increasing serious-
ness with which the Filipinos pursue
the claim, and the ever-increasing
seriousness with which the Malaysians
regard such pursuit, the question is
not what is the face-saver but rather
will the ultimate explosion also be
merely verbal?
At least last week the Malaysians
did not close off all avenues. Kuala
Lumpur did not reciprocate the
Filipino decision to withdraw all but
one of its diplomats from its Malaysian
Embassy. There was evidently strong
argument in the Malaysian Cabinet
to so reciprocate, and the Malaysian
Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman,
'while in Nepal indicated his belief in
it. Evidently at the Malaysian Cabinet
meeting last Wednesday, Deputy Prime
Minister Tun Razak held the line for
moderation and continued holding it
after another Cabinet meeting was
held on Saturday after the Tunku’s
return from his overseas trip. While
Manila reaction has tended to see this
as a conciliatory gesture, there is also
“disappointment” that the anticipated
severance has not been done by Kuala
Lumpur. Additionally, Razak’s moder-
ation has been portrayed as propa-
ganda and even invested with more
perfidious intent. “Malaysia may have
sentenced its diplomats to a life of
hardship,” said one columnist, while
another said that the Philippines should
demand the withdrawal of the Malay-
sian Embassy in Manila “before some
hotheads set it on fire.”
Just about the most hopeful sign of
the week was some pointed questioning
by Nacionalista Senator Salvador
Laurel as to the extent to which the
Sabah claim and the pursuit of it
were in Filipino self-interest. Such
sensible remarks were wholly lost sight


of amidst allegations of intrusions by
Malaysian gunboats, British planes,
plus reports of build-ups of Australian,
British, and Gurkha troops. In Sabah,
the Malaysians detained two Filipinos
avidly photographing a police station
and a fishing vessel which intruded
into their waters. In such an inflam-
mable situation, while the allegations
might not create a fire, a small incident
might.
There is little hope that regional or
extra-regional influence can improve
the situation. This week Australia
has already been in the Sabah claim
“firing line.” Already Philippines
Press reports have alleged that Aus-
tralian troops are being sent to Sabah,
and, as far as can be seen, only one
newspaper played in full the agency
report of the Defence Department’s
strong denial of this. Feeling rather
than fact predominates in too much
Filipino Press work. Australia has yet
to attain a strong image in the Philip-
pines—there is not the same degree of
feeling of “being neighbors” as there
is, mutually, between Australia and
Indonesia. The feeling here is also
that the Commonwealth (of Nations)
determines Australia’s posture. Thus
Australia’s ostensible “neutrality,” set
against the widespread feeling that she
will side with Malaysia (especially
when, if ever, the chips are down),
makes little impact and consequently
would seem to have marginal diplo-
matic value.
For the Filipinos, national honor has
been invoked and is politically at stake;
Whatever is said or done privately, by
the Filipinos, still has to take cognisance
of this public fact. For the Malaysians
the dispute concerns a claim upon
Malaysia itself.
Intervention, or mediation, looks
likely to founder upon realities such as
these. Nor are any qualified mediators
readily available. Manila regards Thai-
land, Indonesia, and Singapore as
being, roughly in that order, relatively
pro-Malaysia. Japan may have thoughts
of mediation - she usually has this
stock response to a crisis - but Kuala
Lumpur, for one thing, knowing that 17
Japanese firms are still padlocked in
Manila and that the Philippines-Japan
Treaty is still unratified, can scarcely
be expected to calculate that Japan’s
other need to conciliate the Filipinos
would be in Malaysia’s self-interest.
Nor is the United States any better
placed unless Washington is willing
to pull out all the stops, which, apart
from being counter-productive, it is
almost certainly unable or unwilling to
do. Obviously, the Filipinos would
expect, and demand, that American in-
tervention favor them. The Malaysians
would expect the Filipinos to expect,
and expect the U.S. to respond. Accord-
ing to some reports from Washington
it is the State Department’s view that
already the time is past for recourse to
the World Court to be a practical solu-
tion. But did Assistant Secretary of
State William Bundy, in Manila last
week after the Honolulu conference,
tell President Marcos this? The newly
arrived U.S. Ambassador is probably
not yet sufficiently engage to do so. If
Bundy did (he refused any public com-
ment whatsoever on Sabah), then at
least that might be a useful contribu-
tion. But one far short of mediation.
Contrary to some Manila expectations,
Bundy did not divert his tour from
Bangkok south to Kuala Lumpur.
Equally obviously, the Malaysians
look to the British for support while
Filipino Press allegations of “sightings”
of jets over the southern Philippines
bearing “insignia similar to that of the
British Royal Air Force” indicate that
Manila anticipates likewise. The Malay-
sians appear disappointed by London’s
inability, so far, to take notice or to
take a stance. The Tunku is now saying
further talks should take place between
the British and the Filipinos, and,
funnily enough, one Filipino columnist,
at least, suggested the same thing
“since Malaysia has proven its unwill-
ingness to be civilised and reasonable,
perhaps we should go after the original
land-grabber. Let us ask Britain if it
would be willing to talk reasonably
with us.” One devious thing the British
could do, of course, is to quietly give
the Filipinos a compelling case for
claiming suzerainty rather than sover-
eignty. The way could then be open for
a financial settlement which might,
might, just save the day and satisfy
honor on both sides.
The only other possibility is that the
Association for South-East Asian
Nations (ASEAN) will do better than
the Asian and Pacific Council (ASPAC).
The first annual meeting of ASEAN
ministers takes place in Djakarta im-
mediately after this week’s ASPAC
meeting in Canberra. Thus the fledgling
organisation is immediately presented
with a challenge. The issue is certain
to be raised there. And again, while
one extremist Filipino opinion has
already expressed the view that since
ASEAN members won’t back the
Philippines down the line, it can “go
hang,” the fact is that Razak and
Ramos will be meeting each other
there. There is, therefore, the faint
hope that the feeling of ASEAN
togetherness, which the original meet-
ing last August engendered, might yet
prevail. Conceivably, the Razak-Ramos
meeting might yet give way to a
Tunku-Marcos meeting at which a
mutually acceptable way of putting the
claim issue on ice until December,
1969, could be found. It’s a thin hope
and, for ASEAN, it’s an acid test.
CZECHOSLOVAKIA
BASTION IN BOHEMIA
THE TROOPS that Russia is deploy-
ing in the exercises announced with
brutal and clumsy ostentation last week
could provide the support in depth
needed if it were to resort to force
in Czechoslovakia. The exercises are
seemingly on the grand scale. They are
purported to stretch from the Baltic
coast right down the Polish and Czech
Soviet Marshal I. V. Jakubovski (r.), in
command of the exercises of the
Warsaw Pact armies, shaking hands with
Czech Defence Minister Martin Dzur
before leaving Prague
borders. The drums are being rolled;
but quite how many soldiers will get
on parade, and where, is the Kremlin’s
secret. The manoeuvres involve rear
support troops, but, pointedly, reservists
are being called up to take part in
them, and this at harvest time, too
civilian vehicles are also being
requisitioned.
These exercises are yet another stage
in the maladroit war of nerves that
the Russians are conducting against
the Czechs. They add to the tensions
already created by the continuing
presence of the Russian troops on
Czechoslovak soil and by the demand
that Russian troops should be per-
manently stationed along the western
border of Czechoslovakia. In contrast
to the Russians the West Germans are
playing it cool, switching their man-
oeuvres next month from the Czech
border to the south-west.
The Russians’ primary fear may be
that the Czech ferment will further
disturb the political stability of Eastern
Europe and even of the Soviet Union.
But there is a more strictly strategic
consideration that must also come into
their thinking: how reliable a military
ally would a new Czechoslovakia be?
The Czechs, remembering the fate of
Hungary in 1956, have insisted time
and again that they intend to remain
Russia’s loyal allies. But the Russians
are plainly dubious about this loyalty.
Any weakening of the alliance would
have important military consequences
for Russia. At the worst, Russia would
have .to cease counting upon the sup-
port of the four tank and ten rifle
divisions, making up an army of around
175,000 men, and the 600 tactical
strike aircraft that Czechoslovakia
contributes to the alliance. In Eastern
Europe, the Czech armed forces are
third only in size to the Russian and
Polish ones. Indeed, apart from Bul-
garia, Czechoslovakia maintains a
higher proportion of its population
under arms than any other country in
the Warsaw Pact. This means that
the Russians could not count on a
military walkover in Czechoslovakia if


they were to resort to armed coercion.
They could deploy a massive superiority
in the air (and in airborne troops),
but, taking into account the difficult
country for tanks along most of the
Czech borders, they do not possess, in
the divisions immediately on hand in
Eastern Europe, an overwhelming
superiority in armored formations.
There is thus a military as well as
political reason for the delay in with-
drawing their troops from Czecho-
slovakia.
Because of its geographical position,
Czechoslovakia must loom nearly as
large in Russia’s military strategy as
East Germany. If it edged toward
neutrality in effect, if not in theory, it
would be a wedge dividing East Ger-
many and Poland in the north from
Hungary in the south. Moreover, the
mountains of Bohemia represent a
pivot for either offensive or defensive
conventional operations in central
Europe, forming a strong southern
flank to any drive or counter-drive
across the north German plains. The
Russian ability to keep a large number
of German and American troops tied
down in southern Germany would be
weakened if threatening concentrations
of troops could be posted only along
the East German border and not in
the Bohemian bastion as well.
The best that Russia can expect,
militarily, to emerge from this crisis is
that Czechoslovakia will remain a firm
ally, fully supporting any defensive or
offensive actions by the Warsaw Pact
powers. But even that is likely to mean
conceding to the Czechs a more in-
dependent voice in the military as well
as the political plans of the alliance.
Russia might ultimately have to settle
for an understanding that Czechoslo-
vakia would defend itself against any
Western attack, with its own force buy-
ing time while Russia and other East
European countries sent reinforcements
forward. (This might be comparable
to the way that “alliance - free”
Sweden’s ability to defend itself pro-
vides a shield for a large part of NATO’s
northern flank.) The very worst a
Czech army that would not fight against
the West at all, and a hostile popula-
tion would create the nightmare
for the Russians of having to garrison
Czechoslovakia with their own troops.
And the more they attempt to force
the Czechs back into line, the closer
the nightmare of a gap in their defen-
sive cordon in Eastern Europe will
loom. The more the Russians threaten
the Czechs, the greater the damage to
their own strategic purposes.
AMERICA/THE PRESIDENCY
THE WORRIED WARRIOR
CAN McCarthy now win? It is easy
to exaggerate the political significance
of Senator Edward Kennedy’s state-
ment last week in which he ruled him-
self out as a Vice-Presidential candi-
date “finally, formally, and not subject
to further reconsideration.” But there
is no doubt where the impact of that
blow fell.
It descended with a sad, doomladen
thud on the Vice-President’s campaign
—many of whose most active supporters
had recently made less and less secret
of their hope that Teddy Kennedy
would give the kiss of life to Mr.
Humphrey’s prospects.
Last week’s events have served to
demonstrate just how insecurely
Hubert Humphrey now stands on his
own feet. He is beginning to look
more and more like the original push-
over candidate—and in normal times
the only doubt would be as to who
would supply the blast of air to blow
him away.
But the times, of course, are not
normal. The Vice-President is in the
fortunate or vulnerable position of
having had, since Bobby Kennedy’s
death, no convincing rival for the
Democratic nomination. By newspapers
and television Eugene McCarthy has
only just begun to be considered as a
serious contender for the Presidency.
But the process has now started.
Pundits who the previous week were
dismissing his candidature out of hand
are suddenly having second thoughts.
Just how far this process has gone was
emphasised when Frank Mankiewicz,
the late Senator Robert Kennedy’s
Press secretary, admitted that he was
now convinced that anyone could
“take” Hubert Humphrey.
As the tone of his remark suggests,
there is no new enthusiasm for the
Minnesotan Senator among those who
have always held aloof from his cam-
paign. If the Party regulars are finally
forced to hand the nomination to him,
they will do it grudgingly. But some
of them are reluctantly coming to
realise that in the end that may be
the only choice they have.
The reason has very little to do with
McCarthy and everything to do with
Hubert Humphrey. The candidate
introduced to the American electorate
only last April as “the happy warrior”
is now the most bedraggled figure on
the American political scene.
One afternoon last week a phone
rang in the office of an extremely
senior State Department official. On
the line was Larry O’Brien, first John
Kennedy’s, then Lyndon Johnson’s,
after that Robert Kennedy’s, and now
finally Hubert Humphrey’s campaign
manager. Mr. O’Brien, it soon emerged,
wanted help.
The State Department official—him-
self an original New Frontiersman
under Kennedy ►— listened patiently,
and finally said wearily: “Larry, it’s a
hell of a tough one. All I can think of
is that you get some of the Humphrey
people to attack our Vietnam policy
you know, guys who are pretty closely
identified with him. Then I suppose
he himself could always try to develop
Clark Clifford’s line about “de-
Americanising” the war. But let’s face
it—at least until the convention’s over,
he’s really in a spot.”
Just how much of a spot was pub-
licly proved three days later. Hum-
phrey, having signalled his intention to
make “a very important statement on
Vietnam,” was briskly called to heel
by the President. The war would be
pressed on, there would be no de-
escalation, and the United States would
never give its support to a coalition
government so long as the Saigon mili-
tary junta opposed it. The next day
the mood in the Vice-President’s cam-
paign headquarters was despairing.
It is a situation ready made for
McCarthy to exploit and he has
been doing it mercilessly. Perhaps the
best way to convey McCarthy’s popular
appeal is simply to give a short extract
from a speech he made the other night
in the new town of Columbia, Mary-
land, to 10,000 cheering people.
“I see,” he remarked, “that the Vice-
President was quoted this morning as
saying he did not know what my policy
with regard to Vietnam was: what my
peace policy was. Well, what I’m trying
Humphrey and McCarthy in June .. .
last week their exchanges weren’t nearly
so friendly
to find out is what the Administration’s
war policy is. But it still surprises me
that the Administration should not
know what I have been recommending,
because for some time now I think the
young people of America have known
what I stand for. I don’t think they
have been following me blindly. The
academic community has known, the
clergy have known, the business and
professional people have known, the
housewives have known—almost every-
one has been responding. Yet we still
find the Vice-President saying he does
not know what my policy is.
“We’ll have to check: maybe he’s
been under house arrest these past four
years. But he mustn’t worry along
with our effort to set all the people
free we intend to set him free: to
involve him in our politics, which is a
politics not really of caution and of
calculation but rather a politics of
openness and genuine commitment.”
In that passage there is the essence
of McCarthy the gaiety, the irrever-
ence, and, beneath it all, the moral
seriousness.
It is hard, in fact, to tell whether he
himself now expects to win, occasionally


in private he will wonder what it will
all be like if “the moment comes when
the coach turns back into a pumpkin”:
but in the very next breath he will
explain, in surprisingly practical terms,
just, why the convention cannot be
regarded as “sewn up.”
What McCarthy has known all along
is what the Party regulars have belat-
edly come to realise: that in the busi-
ness of choosing a Presidential candi-
date they are not entirely free agents.
In both the national polls he is now
easily the strongest candidate in either
Party,, Yet even more influential on
convention delegates are the local State
polls now being taken in most of the
large industrial States. In the two so
far published in California and New
Jersey Hubert Humphrey is shown
running behind not just Nelson Rocke-
feller but Richard Nixon as well:
McCarthy, on the other hand, easily
defeats Nixon and comes out even with
(or better than) Rockefeller.
Probably the only serious chance of
the nomination Gene McCarthy ever
had was to confront the Party with a
choice of survival with him or suicide
with Humphrey. It no longer looks
impossible that at Chicago, in four
weeks’ time, “the man the people
found” may be doing just that.
AMERICA/BOOK CENSORSHIP
No. 1 UN-AMERICAN
RIGHT-WING super-patriotic groups
headed by the John Birch Society con-
sider the J. D. Salinger novel “Catcher
in the Rye” the number one “sub-
versive, un-American” publication in the
Public School Library. This was dis-
covered in a nationwide survey under-
taken by Cowles Publications to deter-
mine the extent of school library cen-
sorship in the United States. Other
publications in disfavor with the
Birchers as unfit for the perusal of
schoolchildren include George Orwell’s
“1984,” Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New
World,” William Golding’s “Lord of
the Flies,” and Harper Lee’s “To Kill
a Mocking Bird.” Many schools have
been forced to remove these novels
from library shelves by pressure from
Right-wing groups in their community.
The most controversial textbook in
use in the country, one which has fre-
quently been withdrawn from use, is
“Land of the Free,” whose co-author is
a Negro social historian, John Hope
Franklin. “Land of the Free,” written
for eighth-grade students, attempts to
give a realistic rather than patriotic
view of American history. It admits
the Boston Tea Party was a “mob
scene” and that slavery hai’med the
nation. It speaks frankly about minor-
ity groups and labor union struggles.
It has been attacked as “Communist-
inspired” and “unpatriotic.” In some
communities Birchers have organised
telephone campaigns to arouse parents
against the book. Parents were informed
that “the word Negro is used 120 times
in the book.”
Wilson ... snapped out of it
BRITAIN
WILSON'S BOUNCE BACK
IN THE LAST days of Parliament
before the summer recess, the central
talking point has been the political
bounce-back of Mr. Harold Wilson.
Whether because the pound is
stronger, Conservative Leader Mr.
Heath’s rating lower, the holidays (and
his son’s marriage) nearer, or because
he is relieved not to have to humor
George Brown and Ray Gunter in the
Cabinet any more, everyone has noticed
that he has snapped out of his almost
paranoic mood of self-pitying dejection
and recovered that aggressive self-con-
fidence which collapsed so conspicuously
after devaluation.
There is still an unsubdued minority
of MPs, led by the now formidable
lobby of former Ministers, waiting for
the next time he is “blown off course”
to have another try at changing leaders.
But even they have to concede that at
least for the time being he is unassail-
able.
Some of his colleagues date this
curious and infectious change of mood
to the end of June, when Press and
television gave maximum and apprecia-
tive coverage to the Fulton Report on
the Civil Service something which
had been very much the Prime Minis-
ter’s personal concern.
Not, of course, that there are many
votes in it. But, unlike most commission
reports, it offers a basis for practical
action that the country can afford, and
it gives Mr. Wilson the cosy feeling
that his administration will have carved
a niche in history. His Ministers have
observed in Mr. Wilson a new readi-
ness to take decisions and exert his will
which had been singularly absent since
last winter.
Mr. Wilson’s troubles are certainly
not yet over: Treasury Ministers are
still insisting that last month’s good
trade figures must be repeated in July,
August, and September before they
can claim the pound is safe; the in-
dustrial front is menacing; the Left
Wing of the Party is confident of
capturing the Party conference.
But in so far as the Party’s health
depends, as to a very considerable
extent it always does, on the personal
stamina and morale of the Leader,
things are looking up.
NEW ZEALAND
NEW WAGES SYSTEM?
NO HEART transplants, only delicate
brain surgery, can ensure any long-
term improvements to industrial rela-
tions after the trauma which has shaken
New Zealand in the past month. Fol-
lowing the Arbitration Court decision
last month to give no general wage
order, the outcome was the historic
marriage of the Federation of Labor
and the Employers’ Federation with a
joint call for changes in the Court.
Then, when these were refused
under pressure from the farmers, they
decided to go back to the Court with a
joint application and updated figures.
This time the farmers, who, like the
employers, had originally opposed the
Wage order, put up a token case against
the joint application, but consciously
avoided outright opposition.
The Court could possibly give a five
percent wage order in view of the
marriage of the organisations whose
representatives are on the Bench with
a judge. But real history in the style
of New Zealand’s social legislation is
unlikely to be made in the modernising
of industrial relations unless a strong
hand can chart a course through the
fractional pressure groups. Labor Minis-
ter Tom Shand has had his authority to
do this impaired by Cabinet and
Caucus rejection of the formula he
proposed at the height of the dispute.
The Government has promised a com-
prehensive review of the wage-fixing
arrangements. The farmers, who dug
their toes in against a review of the
general wage order system that would
keep it in any form, are, however, un-
committed against alternative pro-
cedures. The unions and employers
don’t really know what they want, so
the problem, remains: how to inject
up-to-date ideas into the framework.
Too many of the organisations that
ought to produce comprehensive pro-
posals are either congenitally incap-
able. or choked in pressure-group de-
fences. Some far-seeing independent
commission of inquiry might be able
to insinuate active labor - market
policies, retraining programs, man-
power planning, strong and large
unions, endorsement of the Interna-
tional Labor Organisation Convention
guaranteeing the right to strike, early
warning systems on redundancy, worker
mobility assistance, and those other
ideas percolating through the minds of
those who see industrial relations as
more than wage fixing.
Meanwhile, the Government has a
new distraction with the re-emergence
of a would-be Australian-style Country
Party. Late last week a group said they
wanted to hold the balance of power
like the Australian Country Party and
are to contest 13 seats next general
election. They represent a Poujadiste
dissaffected movement rather than a
serious political proposition, but as
another farmers’ pressure group they
will further inhibit efforts to push
through any big industrial reforms.

The significance of a symbol
No. i OF A SERIES —BACKGROUND OF A COMPANY
A Company’s history is normally of great interest only to veteran shareholders, ex-employees and
perhaps, investment analysts.
The true significance of a progressive Company revolves around its management stability, its
planning'flexibility, its product depth.
Until about 3 years ago, George Hudson was generally recognized as a timber specialist. Timber
milling; Timber importing; Timber retailing. Essentially a family Company, it had a reputation for
service and for specialist trade knowledge.
Nothing more. But equally, nothing less.
Today this has broadened. True, timber retailing outlets are still there. But today they are entire
service centres to the building trade. True, the mills are still there. But today they have been updated
with modern plant and production methods.
Management and staff have benefited from the Company’s traditional skills which have been adapted
to meet the Building Industry’s changing conditions. A carefully-planned diversification programme
has resulted in a series of sophisticated products and services.
The impetus of modern management has added new dimensions to the Company’s horizons.
New policies, new products, new processes—these represent the significance of the new GH symbol.
A symbol of broader-based service for George Hudson clients throughout Australia.

Stockbrokers-your money in their hands
By
BRIAN HOAD
WHEN THE DOYEN of Melbourne’s
stockbrokers, Staniforth Ricketson, died
last year he left an estate valued at $2
million. Another leading Melbourne
broker, Sir lan Potter, despite handing
out millions of philanthropic dollars,
still manages to preserve himself as one
of the richest men in Australia.
Last year, in Sydney alone, brokers
handled business worth $B6O million,
making $25 million in commission be-
fore costs, or about $170,000 a head
for the 145 members of the Sydney
Exchange - and this was only from
broking, which is by no means the pro-
fession’s only source of income.
It is true that last year was a par-
ticularly busy time. Brokers will draw
your attention to the fact that a couple
of years ago they were drawing very
modest salaries in the region of $5OOO.
Perhaps a few of them were. But the
lean years are always preceded and
followed by the fat. And any broker
who did not net at least $40,000 last
year and for some the figure would
be nearer $lOO,OOO should be seek-
ing more suitable employment.
Understandably, brokers are modest
about their incomes. With exceptions
they are not particularly conspicuous
spenders and apart from some concen-
tration in Toorak they show little ten-
dency to gravitate toward any expen-
sive suburban belt in particular. Atti-
tudes stem from a self-governing code
of rules which demands, above all else,
discretion. Publicity stunts of any
description are matters for prompt
disciplinary action. Understandable, at
least, is the seemingly deep-seated
reluctance among the fraternity to
expose its members, its methods, and
its morals to that sort of public scrutiny
which seems justified for an industry
which handles so much of the public’s,
money on a basis of so much good
faith.
Not as strong as it once was, that
faith has come in for something of a
shaking in recent weeks. The end of the
financial year is a traditionally awkward
period for the share market, aggravated
this time by questions on the future of
sterling and, possibly, aggravated still
further by the brokers themselves. It is
a prickly question; but some recent
letters to the Press have been apportion-
ing the blame pretty bluntly. Mr.
J. H. Cooper, chairman of the Sydney
Exchange, and a clutch of broking
houses have been accused of publicly
encouraging the recent flight out of
mining into industrial stocks. Not only
the much-vaunted discretion has come
into question. Weakening mines, sink-
ing oils, and precipitate flights from one
group of stocks to another may be
enervating for the investor, but for the
472 brokers on 'the nation’s five stock
exchanges it is all good business.
Mr. Cooper, in fact, was keen to
suggest only that some of the prices
for mining stocks at the time could
not be justified by rational argument
from known facts; that the situation
was a result of “speculative mania”
which had driven people to buy any-
thing, or at best buy the cheapest stock
in the most fashionable area. But
there were two points at least invit-
ing open conflict. The brokers, who
Mr. Cooper believed had “acquitted
themselves well in the sphere of public
responsibility,” had until recently been
condoning if not encouraging their
clients’ mania. And even if they are
not prepared to admit it themselves,
in the U.S., where brokers tend to be
more practical than sanctimonious, the
tactic of going for a cheap stock in a
fashionable field is freely acknowledged
to be standard practice. As one U.S.
broker put it recently: “In a hot in-
dustry even the garbage is going to go
through the roof. If you want to
make the biggest gain you pick the
most marginal company.”
Mr. Cooper should not have been
surprised when the conflict started.
One somewhat bewildered investor
writing to the Press pointed out that
he had only just finished carting his
portfolio around “three leading brok-
ers” seeking advice. Acting in good
faith on their recommendations he had
sold off a few industrials and left him-
self with 14 oil and seven mining
stocks.
Others noted that within 24 hours
of Mr. Cooper’s published statement
“there was a very substantial switch
from mining into industrial shares”
and, more to the point, challenged his
moral standpoint in having said what
he did. They suggested that all stock
exchanges in this country should
henceforth prohibit their members
from making any
pub 1 ic statement
whatsoever.
However well in-
tentioned the pub-
lic statements may
have been, they
have brought the
brokers under closer
scrutiny by in-
vestors. Officialdom
has been taking
an interest for some
time. Legislation to
control stock ex-
changes and their
members, particu-
larly in such areas
where the func-
tion of broking can
come into conflict
with other interests
such as underwrit-
ing new capital or
sitting on the boards
of public com-
panies or the buying and selling of
shares by brokers on their own
account, is already under consideration
by the Attorneys-General Standing
Committee.
But the brokers strongly defend their
practices. In helping to raise money for
companies by underwriting new share
issues, so guaranteeing that the share
capital will be raised, brokers point out
that their behaviour is at least out in
the open, whereas that of their chief
rivals, the merchant banks, is not. They
claim, too, that their behaviour is con-
ditioned by the checks and balances that
are part and parcel of the activity; that
it would only be possible to foist dud
shares on clients once, before they
withdrew their patronage. But things
are not as blandly simple as that. The
very complexity of the brokers’ func-
tions provides scope enough for manipu-
lating markets and prices alike, and if
carried out with skill and within reason,
this would hardly be noticeable by the
general public under the present cir-
cumstances.
On the subject of directorships in
public companies, similar reservations
persist, and yet when brokers point out
that there is such a dearth of managerial
talent in Australia that it would be
patently foolish to withdraw an entire
segment of it en bloc, there seems, for
purely practical reasons, little point in
continuing the argument at present.
The good faith of the investing public
must still continue to provide its time-
honored support for the entire system.
In its persistent aversion toward out-
side interference or control, the broking
profession seems to be assuming that it
is its unassailable right to demand the
public’s good faith in perpetuity. It is
quaint of them to do so. When the
exchanges were largely strongholds of
Sydney Stock Exchange, 1872
at least an outward Victorian respec-
tability, the brokers stood in a firmer
state of grace with the public than they
do today, whether deservedly so or not.
But the image of the brokers has weak-
ened. “Today we’re mostly atheists like
everybody else,” commented a Sydney
broker. And yet the aura of solid, God-
fearing brokers is still expected to
radiate confidence into the trusting
hearts of the private investors. In Mel-
bourne, where a broker was jailed for
fraud only last month, we are still asked
to believe that “a gentleman’s word is
his bond.”
If religious connections have become
meaningless, education has not, not even
in Sydney. There, members are still
“mostly from the Great Public Schools”
though there are interlopers from
high schools, even the “less-acceptable”
ones, such as Canterbury - and about
60 percent of members are said to have
tertiary qualifications in accountancy or
economics or some such subject. Aca-
demically speaking, it is all a bit vague.
Two years ago there was set up the
Securities Institute of Australia, a sort
of school for prospective brokers run by
the brokers, which could well become
the official gateway into the exchanges,
but not yet.
One of the more-formidable barriers
for any bright, young, ordinary man
who is intent on becoming a member
of the affluent club, is the money
required to buy a seat. The price fluctu-
ates according to the overall state of
the market. In Sydney, in 1964, it was
as high as $34,000, falling back to
around $20,000 in 1965, and now up
again around the $30,000 mark. Prices
in Melbourne are more modest, the
most recent seat changing hands at
$22,000. There are said to be waiting-
lists for the privilege.
But money alone cannot open the
door Havin? acauired the cash for a
seat, and a nomination, the final trial
comes before the committees of the
exchanges, which are elected annually
by members from among their ranks.
“Backgrounds” are examined
thoroughly, “sound ethical records” are
de rigueur. And if Uncle Jack or Dad is
already one of the boys, the process of
screening becomes so much easier and
more reliable. Nepotism, as a matter of
convenience, is unavoidable. But it does
not dominate; the business has become
far too tough and competitive for that.
A good broker will do well, quickly, no
matter what his background, and a bad
one will stagnate; four of the five top
broking houses in Sydney and Mel-
bourne have, after all, been going only
since World War 11.
The com mittees of the exchanges can
also dedde t 0 create new seats w h en
the p res sure of business demands it.
In Sydney, 45 such seats have appeared
s i nc / t h e war , 20 over the past ten
s Since 1962 t h e system of non-
7 mcmhcr partne rs in broking houses has
been in operation. Like their member
part ners they take a cut in the profits
and come under the con trol of the
exchange, but they do not have a seat

timer can °P erate efficiently.
The partnerships are taking the per-
sonal touch out of broking. The days
of the official introduction, the discreet
inquiries into solvency over a pot of
tea, are mostly gone. This change has
presented its problems. There are plenty
of rumors about how large clients’ bad
debts stand at present after the frantic
boom months at the beginning of the
year, and it is surprising to realise that
not a few brokers were stupid enough
not to bother about checking prospective
clients. Teenagers with nothing more
than avarice were taken on for the ask-
ing, and pseudonyms and fictitious
addresses put in an embarrassing
appearance when the shake-outs on the
market started. About three-quarters of
the trading is, however, handled by the
large broking houses, who still tend to
check on prospective clients as a matter
of course, even though some are a little
squeamish about the procedure. It is a
somewhat unprofessional reaction.
Unlike some other countries, there is

brokers may extend. Indeed credit itself

becoming something of a pest to the
bigger brokers. If the broker-client rela-
tionship isn t what it used to be, it is
because the broker has more important
and more profitable things to occupy
himself with. It is a change of mood
which goes some way to explaining the
rece nt extraordinary move to increase
t h e minimum size of share parcels. The
small investor is dispensable when
brokers are running investment corn-
panies, arranging off-market deals with
the institutions, and keeping under con-
trol interests in the short-term money
mar ket, the merchant banks, and the
commercial bill companies. It is a trend
which in part answers the critics of
Mr. Cooper’s anti-boom statements. The
critics seemed to be in some doubt
whether the brokers were aware that
such statements “can seriously jeopar-
dise the financial holding of a large
section of the community, particularly
the small shareholder . . .”
In the circumstances, it is not sur-
prising that few clients ever have deal-
ings with the broker himself, but with

“client advisers” who are, to quote a
recent advertisement, “personable and
articulate men aged 28-38 . . . education
to at least Leaving Certificate . . . pre-
ferably with experience in the Stock
Market or a major financial institution.”
These are the oracles which the small
investor consults and on the wisdom of
whose pronouncements the good faith
of the public dies or is born again—
as if one man could be expected to
have an off-the-cuff opinion of any of
a thousand and more companies. The
client adviser is more closely related
to the salesman than an expert in com-
mercial knowledge. Although ideas of
him selling on commission, as is the
practice in the U.S., are energetically
denied—“it would be a breach of the
code and draw a heavy fine” —the
rumors that there is some sort of tie-up
between salary and turnover remain
strongly persistent.
The client’s order having been placed
with the adviser, it passes to the floor
of the exchange where the broker’s
operator makes the buying or selling
bid according to the instructions. The
operator then lists the transactions he
has done during the day and these are
then attributed to clients; for instance,
an operator may have had 20 separate
orders for one share which he satisfied
in one big purchase, or vice versa.
The client is then billed and until he
pays, the broking firm does not for-
ward his name for registration as the
new shareholder. Similarly, when he
sells, the broker does not pay the client
until the client sends in the share cer-
tificates involved. This means that in
cases where a client has not yet received
his share certificate —some companies
fall very far behind in handling scrip
during boom periods he cannot get
paid if he has resold his shares and
must wait, perhaps for months, even
though the buyer has been obliged to
pay immediately. The broker operates
through a trust fund where all the
money paid in goes and awaits trans-
fer, and a permanent overdraft from
which all payments are made and which
can grow alarmingly large. The system
may prove annoying to clients or
frightening to bank managers, but it
is of no financial advantage to the
broker, either.
It is not only the companies in their
scrip handling that tend to fall down in
boom periods. The unprecedented activ-
ity on the market during the first half
of this year caught the brokers them-
selves hopelessly unprepared. Many had
reduced their staff by as much as 30
percent when the 1964 market recovery
fizzled out and was followed by two
years of more or less stagnant prices.
In the past year some have doubled,
and in some instances trebled, their
staffs. Overtime became a matter of
course in most offices, with people from
other jobs, like bank clerks, coming in
of an evening in an attempt to clear
the brokers’ paper work. Apart from
the difficulties of finding all the new
manpower, space has become a prob-
lem, too, with staff “just about hanging
out of the windows,” and many brokers
on the march to larger offices.
Staff problems are endemic, it seems,
in an essentially seasonal business. The
instability of employment is to some
extent compensated for by fat pay-
packets. Operators are offered up to
$12,000 a year, client advisers $lO,OOO,
and research men $B,OOO, with plenty
of handsome bonuses handed out at the
end of the financial year. A moderation
in salaries and the elimination of the
bonus system could perhaps help tide
a greater percentage of the staff over
the more-inactive periods that will
inevitably follow. The more-efficient,
better-experienced, and more-stable
workforce so achieved would be an
advantage to everyone concerned.
Stock brokers have greater scope for
improving the efficiency of their pro-
fession than in personnel matters alone.
Apart from efforts such as the Securi-
ties Institute of Australia, which is
concerned with educating the brokers
themselves, the Exchanges run classes
for educating the general public, and
under the threat of increasing Govern-
The boom has made staff problems endemic in brokers’ offices
ment intervention they have made
moves in recent times to require better
standards of reporting to shareholders
by the companies whose shares they deal
in. It is hardly the blame of the brokers
that their powers in this direction are
limited. If a company refuses to comply
with suggestions all the Exchanges can
do is to de-list the company: to refuse
to allow their members to deal in the
shares. This may be useful in the case
of a small company which desparately
needs listing, but it is of little concern
to a major company, whose existence
is of more concern to the Exchanges
than the Exchanges are to it. There
are, after all, certain factions only to
eager to provide a rival market. In
Melbourne there is already a “second
market,” with lower rates of broker-
age than apply on the various State
Exchanges, and in the transactions that
go on between institution and institu-
tion, between merchant bank and mer-
chant bank, there exists a “third mar-
ket,” too. These are the rivals of the
brokers.
In the “second market” nobody
seems to know where the stock comes
from nor where it goes and there
seems to be a general contempt
among brokers for the “so-called cut-
price brokerage of one percent.” Scorn
is the only official weapon they have
against these rivals. Their exchange
laws do not allow them to offer com-
petitive brokerage fees. There is noth-
ing, however, to prevent them doing
off-market deals with their biggest
and favorite clients, and there is noth-
ing against them acting as principals,
buying the shares in their own right
and then reselling at what price they
please.
The question of brokers acting as
principals is a difficult one. It is,
perhaps, a little hard to suggest that
a broker’s right to invest his private
capital be withdrawn. But the line
between investing and speculating can
be very vague. A broker who was
suspended from the Sydney Stock
Exchange last year when his business
affairs were discovered to show a defi-
ciency of $700,000, took the matter to
court seeking an injunction to restrain
the Exchange from proceeding with a
petition for his bankruptcy. Some
interesting aspects of the working of
the Exchange were revealed. It was
found that not infrequently the broker
met a buying order from a client by
selling shares held by him in his
house account. A large part of the
man’s day-to-day activities were taken
up with the buying and selling of
shares on his own behalf through his
house account, averaging about 47 in-
dividual transactions a day, with trans-
actions in one particular share featuring
almost every day for a year. In sort-
ing out the mess he had got himself
into, the Exchange found that although
his house account had a market value
of nearly a million dollars, it did not,
in some cases, contain shares to deliver
on contracts of sales he had already
made. As a result, it was found that
$250,000 was left owing to clients,
which fellow brokers, honoring their
dictum of unlimited liability, clubbed
together to pay off.
The point is that the broker, in
selling from his house account, was
doing no more than he was allowed
to do, provided he pointed out to each
client that he was, in fact, acting as

principal and not agent. It is the
same business which is, after all, done
on a large scale with the institutions.
But in this case, whether intentionally
or not, the complexity of the house
account passed out of control and the
broker ended up selling, as principal,
shares he did not have.
Mr. Justice Street dismissed the
broker’s application with some general
words of admonishment for the broking
profession in general. Their duty to
advise clients on shares preclude them,
he said, from “playing the market.”
Brokers who seek to enrich themselves
by trading with the public, thereby dis-
credit themselves and their calling. Mr.
Justice Street said that brokers must
realise the limitations in their positions,
and the Stock Exchange, in the public
interest, must enforce those limitations.
A fundamental principle of commercial
morality would be gravely compromised
if brokers were permitted to enter the
share market, not for their clients, but
in competition against them. Such com-
ments, he felt, were necessary in view
of the apparently widespread practice
of share brokers acting as traders.
In their defence, the brokers point
out that there are sound practical
reasons for them acting as principals.
Unlike the “jobbers” in London or the
“specialists” in New York, there is no
special class of people here to help
the digestion of large parcels of shares,
and only through the brokers acting as
principals can the process be carried
out. The size of the markets handled
by the individual State Exchanges prob-
ably does not warrant the introduction
of “jobbers” or “specialists” in their
own right. A national market, an inti-
mate link-up between Melbourne and
Sydney to create a single market, almost
certainly would. Arguments on “job-
bing,” however, are hardly relevant to
the broader implications of Mr. Justice
Street’s observations.
The function of brokers as traders,
as underwriters, as organisers of invest-
ment companies, as members of boards
of directors conflict, inevitably, with the
one function which Mr. Justice Street
(perhaps somewhat old-fashionedly)
saw as the principal role, that of advis-
ing clients on shares. It is the one role
which they could relinquish most pain-
lessly.
Theirs is a complex field of activity
over which only the committees of the
Exchanges have control, concerned only
that the existing rules of the Exchanges
are followed, and seemingly most reluc-
tant to introduce new ones. If the rules
are broken, the offender goes for “trial”
before a disciplinary court, which has
been likened in its summary and arbit-
rary nature to the Star Chamber courts
of England, which were thankfully abol-
ished in 1640. Fines and even banish-
ment from the Exchange can be meted
out. The system creaks with antiquity.
And yet, with their computerised
accounting and analysis systems, the
tendency away from the 18th-century
practice of paper stock certificates
toward some sort of automated system
where all transactions would be recorded
on an electronic master file like bank
accounts, the ever-extending fields of
activity, and the changing status of the
private investor, the Exchanges are mov-
ing very much with the times. It seems
reasonable that the government of the
Exchanges should also be up-dated.
With this in mind, the Attorneys-
General initiated an inquiry into Stock
Exchanges and brokers last February.
It is certainly not too soon to let some
fresh air into the inner sanctums, to
remove the activities of the brokers
from shadows of doubt, and rather than
merely say that justice is done, to allow
it to be seen to be done.
The public faith at the moment could
do with a bit of reviving, and even
though the private investor is of little
importance to some of the larger
brokers, the fact that others still care
was heard as a rumbling within the
Exchanges as well as without when
Mr. Cooper chose to make his public
statement on the mining stocks.
Some, at least, seem aware that a
major loss of faith at the moment with
Small investors in the public gallery ...
“something of a pest”
so many more private investments at
stake than ever before, could lead into
a major doldrums that might last for
years, to the detriment of the big, bright
new offices and the hugely expanded
staff commitments.
The market, made up of so many
individual investors, has a personality
of its own and a waywardness which
not the brokers, nor the institutions, nor
anyone else can entirely predict. London
may have pushed the market up here,
but the Australian small investor is in
a position to drag it down. Traditionally
manic-depressive, Australia swings be-
tween irrepressible optimism and
extreme caution. Mr. Cooper seems to
have missed the simplicity of the pat-
tern. If an overseas-inspired shake-out
became evident, he says, Australians
should calmly assess the record and
make up their own minds. But “I am
regretfully forced to the conclusion that
the often-talked-about lack of self-
confidence in the Australian make-up
is beginning to rub off on the share
market.” As chairman of the Sydney
Stock Exchange, his right to encourage
the process must remain suspect.

The town
that has lost
its reason
Though Enoch Powell was dropped from the Conservative Party
Shadow Cabinet for his attitude to colored migration to Britain, he
has now become part of British folklore
OAK STREET is in a colored area of
Wolverhampton known to the locals as
“Wog Alley.” Sipping pints together in
the pub were an indignant foundry-
man, an old-age pensioner in immacu-
late shoes, and a timid coalman with a
friend who said his seven-year-old
daughter had been raped by a West
Indian. They talked about “the
darkies.”
“The darkies aren’t the foreigners.
We’re the foreigners now,” said the pen-
sioner, although he wasn’t saying much.
“It’s a fact!” said the foundry-
man. “We haven’t a say in it any
more. They command the place now.”
“They’re even opening up their own
pubs,” added the coalman, shaking his
head.
“And they don’t keep licensing
hours,” said the foundryman. “It’s a
fact! They’re even buying the busi-
nesses. Bloody racketeers. Enoch’s the
only one with any guts and I’m a
strong Labor man.”
“If a Labor man had said the same,”
said the coalman. “I’d still have to
agree with him.”
“That’s right,” said the foundry-
man. “Send the swines back home.
Enoch’s right. I mean, he knows. He’s
lived with it. He’s seen it.”
. “Wogs!” cried the friend of the coal-
man, and stubbed out his cigarette.
After a while, a Jamaican walked
into the pub and the foundryman
leaned over to say in a whisper that
could have been heard in Montego
Bay: “You see, he’s civilised. He’s one
of the good ones.” The Jamaican drank
his pint at the bar, and left.
“It’s not that we don’t mix with
them,” explained the coalman. “It’s
them that don’t want to know us.”
“We’re the ones being discriminated
against,” said his friend. “And the
police are no bloody use. They’re petri-
fied of them. Drink rackets, drug
rackets, the bloody lot. But you’ll
never see the police doing anything.
“If it were us —no chance. Peeing
in the alley. They get away with any-
thing. Gambling in the park. You go
into the park and you’ll see that many
turbans it looks like a field of bloody
daisies.”
“They’re taking us over,” said the
pensioner.
“That’s right,” said the foundry-
man. “They’ve told me in front of the
police we’ll bloody rule you one
day.”
“I complained when they got my
daughter, but it didn’t get me any-
where. I mean, what chance have you
got? Christ! If we did what they did
we’d spend half our time in nick.”
“The point is,” said the pensioner,
“if they come here, why shouldn’t they
live as we do? They don’t even speak
the language. They don’t want to.
They don’t understand income tax be-
cause they don’t want to. But they
understand National Assistance. They
understand that!”
“What about those with the big
beards on the dole? They never do
a stroke. But go into the betting shop
and you’ll see ’em, they’re that bloody
ignorant.”
“Those do-gooders spouting on TV
they ought to come and live with
it. The stink is enough to blind you.
People say where else can they go.
But where were they before?”
“That’s right,” said the foundryman,
“people say they’re running the hos-
pitals, but who was running them e-
fore? Tell me that! And don’t forget
( they’re only looking after their own
kind, anyway.”
“I know some good ones,” said the
coalman, sounding apologetic.
“I do, too,” added his friend. “We
all know some good ones, but there’s
more bad.”
“You couldn’t count the good ones
on one hand,” said the pensioner. He
laughed and toddled outside.
“They all carry knives,” said the
friend.
“It’s true,” said the coalman. “Every
one of them does.”
“It’s the way they live,” said the
foundryman, 10 began to dominate
the conversation. “Wherever they go
there’s trouble. They’ve no intelligence.
Everything’s abuse. They’ve got 24 in
a bloody house. They throw food in the
streets and cause rats. There’s one
street you can’t walk down for rat-
holes. They even make a noise playing
dominoes. They claim for three wives
at the Labor Exchange and pack the
money off out of the country. They’ve
got prostitutes on the game. They’re
just degrading us. The Government
can cover it up, but it’s there. We
ought to put the boot in. Stick your
boot in them.”
When the conversation finally ended,
after more than an hour and a half
of continual, bewildering abuse, I
turned around and realised that a
Nigerian standing at the bar must have
heard every word. Only the coalman
looked embarrassed; he offered the
man a cigarette which was firmly
refused. I asked the Nigerian what
he thought. “I don’t think,” he said,
and stared ahead. But his fixed stare
was not the look of a man who didn’t
think.
The day after Mr. Enoch Powell’s
speech, the North Wolverhampton
Working Men’s Club voted to keep
colored immigrants out of the club
“under any pretext, either as members,
visitors, or visiting artists.” The club
is in a colored area near the football
ground off the Waterloo Road, which
is known to locals as “Banana Row.”
It has 4000 members. The vote was
unanimous. One member proposed a
debate on the possibility of at least
allowing colored artists into the club,
but couldn’t find a seconder. In prac-
tice, the vote confirmed a club rule
that has existed for the past ten years.
Mr. George Hall, the secretary of
the club since 1955, received 150 letters
of support from all over the country,
and four letters of protest, three of
them unsigned and one from an Italian.
The letters often referred to England,
the Queen, Churchill, and God.
Mr. Hall also received one letter
threatening his life, and two from
the British Black Muslim Society. The
first said: “Your club is number seven
on the fire list.” The second, posted a
few days later, said: “Your club is
number six.” .
At another large club in Wolver-
hampton, the West End Working Men’s
Club, the secretary physically threw


After the "Keep Britain White"
speech of Enoch Powell, MP, the
London "Observer" sent reporter
John Heilpern to live a month in
Powell's Midlands constituency,
Wolverhampton. Here's his report:
me out as he shouted over and over
again, “We have no color problem
here. There is no problem. We have
no color problem here.” That club, too,
doesn’t allow colored people on the
premises.
Mr. Hall, however, wearing the club
tie and the Working Men’s Institute
badge on a dark, shiny suit, explained
why his club didn’t want colored
people.
“Now then,” he told me, “the colored
people go into the pubs and in no
time the white people drift away.
They’re just fed up to the teeth with
them. Now, if we had them in the club,
which we’ve built up ourselves and
paid £70,000 for, now supposing they
were allowed in, well, I know for a
fact that for every one of them who
came in, 100 members would walk out.
So what would happen in two or three
years’ time the coloreds would take
the club over.
“All we’re saying is that we’ve the
right to keep them out. It’s no good
being bigoted. They can have their own
club. But we’ve had enough of being
told we’ve got to like them. They’ve
got their way of life, and we’ve got
ours.
“They don’t want to conform. I
mean, who is creating a separate
society more than the Sikhs? I’ve never
been unfortunate enough to live by one,
but I understand they have these par-
ties that go on till three and four in
the morning. Our members live by
them and they know what it’s like.
All this dirt and sex. There are areas
in this town where a white woman
wouldn’t dare walk down the street.
If they’d come in small numbers like
the Italians there wouldn’t have been
a problem. But they breed like rabbits.”
Mr. Hall, who has six children,
couldn’t explain why, if it was a case
of numbers, the club hadn’t admitted
colored members since the ’fifties,
when the colored population was negli-
gible. “Perhaps our members had the
foresight to see what was going to
happen,” he said. Nor had he realised
that the town contains approximately
1000 Italians —the same number as
Pakistanis. But any attempt to correct
Although the Left-wing “New Statesman” sees Powell this way, last week a survey
showed him as the most popular choice for the Conservative Party leadership
factual errors was usually swept aside
as if the attempt itself were a betrayal.
For instance, Mr. Hall, like many
people I spoke to, was convinced that
the colored population in general both
lived off National Assistance and took
the white man’s jobs. How they can do
both at the same time must rank as
black magic, for the unemployment
figure for adults in Wolverhampton is
just 0.2 percent above the national
average. An official of the Employment
Department explained that the colored
immigrants had “no effect whatsoever”
on unemployment.
Mr. Hall offered the best rationalisa-
tion of color prejudice I came across
in Wolverhampton: “People fail to
realise,” he said, “that the average
workingman is the most conservative
in the world. He doesn’t like change.
He wakes up one day and finds him-
self living practically in the Punjab.
But my generation was always taught
that black was dirty and white was
clean. We were taught about the Black
Hole of Calcutta, the Zulu War, and
all those atrocities perpetrated by the
colored people. That was what our
education was about, and now, when
the country’s being flooded with
coloreds, we’ve got to go and revise all
our ideas.”
It seems a grotesque generalisation to
say that the feelings of Mr. Hall and
the men in the Oak Street pub aren’t
exceptional but typical of the great
majority of people in Wolverhampton;
yet it’s true. There may be hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of Wulfrunians who
disagree with them, but if there are
they weren’t in the pubs I went to, or
in the clubs, or the dance halls, or the
youth clubs, or the streets.
The whites of Wolverhampton are
angry and bewildered. In small, over-
crowded sections of the town they see
streets that have “gone” colored; they
see schools that have been “abandoned”
to colored children; and they see a
strange people, sometimes dressed dif-
ferently, cooking different food. But
let any of those “strange people” try
to move into a better area and the
white population of Wolverhampton,
like characters out of Chekhov, “go
into mourning for their lives.”
Mr. Fred Griffin is a coal merchant,
the boss of the coalman I’d met in Oak
Street, and something of a popular
spokesman for the people in that area.
He lives in a road which used to be
fashionable “before the darkies came,”
in a smart house between an Indian
family on one side and a Jamaican
family on the other. His house, he
says, has devalued £lOOO, but Mr.
Griffin is still determined to move out
of the area. “It’ll go to the blacks,” he
explained. “There’s no choice. Nobody
else will want it except them. It’s the
same all over.”
What was surprising about the people
I met in the working-class areas of
Wolverhampton wasn’t just their views,
but the force with which these views
were expressed. I could stop practically
anyone in the streets, and, unembar-
rassed, they would tell me that colored
people were pigs, that they wanted
burning, that they were taking over,
and that Enoch was right.
Social workers told me that this
wasn’t the case before Powell’s speech:
only since then have opinions been ex-
pressed in open, and occasionally vio-
lent, abuse. But the locals don’t simply
agree with Powell: they also agree with
something he never actually said. In
a nutshell, they believe he said, “Send
the lot back home.”
Hard as I tried, I couldn’t find the
sex-orgies or the all-night parties I’d
been told were “devaluing” the area.
One night, a group of teenagers took me
to a “notorious” pub, the Bruford Arms,
to witness colored people peeing against
the walls as they came out. “Well,” said
one of the lads, shamefaced, “I never
said they did it every night.” (Actually
he did.)
But it would be folly to deny that
men like Mr. Griffin are reacting to a
situation that has affected and, in some
cases, changed their lives. There are,
for example, 1000 houses in Wolver-
hampton in “multiple occupation,” and
most of these are occupied by colored
immigrants. Curiously, the Town Hall
has no figures for the number of


overcrowded houses, but that figure of
1000 reveals not only a housing shortage
and what’s being done about it but the
difficulty colored immigrants have in
finding decent accommodation. Mr.
Griffin, however, like so many people
I spoke to, isn’t interested in explana-
tions: he cares about only what his
eyes, his ears, and even his nose tell
him. He took me around the back streets
to prove his point.
“What did I tell you?” he said as
we walked around one of the rougher
colored areas off Oak Street. “It’s a
stink-box. Look! All this used to be
nice. They’ve just let it go. It’s just
filth. Bloody disgraceful!” In some
cases it was impossible to disagree.
Down rotting alleys we could see into
the backyards of several colored houses,
and as Mr. Griffin fussed over every
detail like a house-proud mother, I
could observe that the yards were indeed
in a dreadful condition. “Go on,” he
cried, “note it down!” There were
empty beer cans, scraps of food, worm-
ridden furniture, refuse spilling out of
packed dustbins, dirty washing, rubbish
tips, and, occasionally, the foul smell of
drains.
I could have told Mr. Griffin that
I’d seen some white houses that didn’t
seem much better, and had visited other
colored homes that had about them a
thorough almost defiant, cleanliness.
But as Mr. Griffin stood among the
rubble, triumphant, there didn’t seem
much point. “You see,” he said, “I’m
not prejudiced, am I?”
Alderman Robert Campbell, the
Mayor of Wolverhampton, is himself an
immigrant. He came to England from
Northern Ireland in 1946, has been a
Conservative councillor for 14 years, and
owns a fish-and-chip shop. “Wulfrun-
ians,” said Alderman Campbell, “are
very friendly people. I think you’ll find
they readily accept an influx of
strangers. After all, I’m one myself.”
If this were so, why didn’t the work-
ing men’s clubs admit colored members?
“I feel strongly about this,” said
Alderman Campbell. “A club is a club.
The idea is for people of similar out-
look to meet. It’s the same as a Labor
Club or a Conservative Club. Lord
Nuffield’s wife was once refused permis-
sion to join a golf club, though I don’t
think she was black” (laughter). “In
any case,” Alderman Campbell con-
tinued, “they don’t let whites into their
clubs.” The colored community of
Wolverhampton doesn’t have any clubs.
There is one, owned by a former
Labor councillor, where colored people
mostly go, but white people can, too,
for I went myself.
Did Alderman Campbell believe there
to be a color problem in the town?
“There isn’t a color problem here in
the racial sense,” he replied. “It’s the
terrific numbers that have created the
difficulty.” (The colored community
comprises 5.4 percent of the popula-
tion.) “But there’s no real evidence
that discrimination is going to be a big
issue,” Alderman Campbell continued.
“I’ve seen no evidence at all of color
Two apartheid views in Trafalgar
Square, one against the South African
variety, the other all for the home-brand
strife. Racial intolerance doesn’t exist
in Wolverhampton. We don’t have any
trouble. There’s no evidence of discrim-
ination. I’ve never seen any marches or
demonstrations here.
Following Enoch Powell’s speech,
there were marches in Wolverhampton
both for and against Powell on
April 24, April 27, and May 4. The
first march, by factory workers support-
ing Powell, ended outside the Town
Hall.
As I left the mayor, his secretary,
who was all files and smiles, gave me
the Official Handbook of Wolverhamp-
ton. “I think this’ll help,” he said,
beaming. And it did, except in one im-
portant aspect: throughout the 280 pages
of the book no reference is made to the
colored community. None of the pic-
tures in the book, even those taken in-
side factories, shows a colored face. The
general impression the book creates isn’t
just that the colored population of Wol-
verhampton hasn’t made any contribu-
tion to the town, but, rather, that the
colored community doesn’t exist.
A stranger walking through the busy
shopping centre would have that impres-
sion strengthened if he looked for a
colored sales assistant, for in all the
shops I went into there wasn’t one
Nor could I find a colored bank clerk
at any of the branches in the centre
of town, or even that news-hogging illus-
tration of a liberal society, a colored
policeman. Beatties, the largest store in
Wolverhampton, employs over 1000
staff, but does not employ one colored
assistant. It was explained to me, by
Beatties as by other shops, that “there
just weren’t any vacancies,” that they’d
“definitely hired colored people in the
past,” but that the colored community,
in any case, couldn’t speak English well
enough.” There are over 6000 West
Indians in Wolverhampton: English is
the West Indian’s native language.
Obviously, there are language diffi-
culties—West Indians don’t always have
an adequate grasp of English—just as
there are social
problems; yet is it
conceivable that out
of a colored popu-
lation of 14,500, no
one is qualified to
be a shop assistant?
Most of the
colored population
work in factories
and on the buses,
where there are
more colored
workers than white.
One factory has 250
colored workers out
of a labor force of
1300, and describes
relat i o n s with
colored employees
as “e xcel 1 e n t,”
although 180 of
them recently walked out on strike.
They had 18 shop stewards: three are
colored. There are 35 supervisors: all
of them are white. Sixty-two percent
of the bus workers are colored. There
are 40 inspectors: all of them are white.
Twenty-three percent of the workers at
another factory are colored. There are
approximately 50 shop stewards: two
are colored. There are approximately
125 supervisors: all of them are white.
One of the main difficulties in Wol-
verhampton is housing: what does Aider-
man Farmer, chairman of the Housing
Committee, feel about the color prob-
lem? We met in an atmosphere of rea-
son and calm among the imitation-
leather armchairs of the private mem-
bers’ room at the Town Hall. Another
councillor snored quietly in a corner.
“It’s an exceedingly difficult prob-
lem,” said Alderman Farmer, who had
a relaxed, chirpy air about him. “I
think we all feel that the rest of the
country just don’t want to understand
the problem we’ve got.” During the
course of the conversation, Alderman
Farmer inadvertently made three crucial
factual errors: he added another 10,000
on to the colored population; he esti-
mated the colored birthrate as five or
six times higher than the white; and

he underestimated the waiting list for
council houses by almost 2500. •
“It is a problem,” Alderman Farmer
continued, “but is it fair that we should
shoulder so much of the burden here
in Wolverhampton?” What did he mean
by “burden?” “Well, you’ve only got to
think of the birthrate, which is five or
six times as high as ours. So what will
the population be in 20 years? I mean,
what causes riots? The real point is:
we all pay lip-service to a multi-racial
society, but why should it be us and a
few others that have to bear the entire
burden?”
The 1967 record of births in Wolver-
hampton shows that colored mothers
account for 33 percent of hospital beds.
Alderman Farmer, like many people,
was confused by this figure: not only are
immigrant mothers generally of child-
bearing age at the present time but
the houses in which they live are often
unsuitable for domestic births. The
truth is that the high proportion of in-
stitutional births in Wolverhampton re-
flects the state of immigrant housing
conditions, not a fantastic birthrate.
Of course the birthrate of the colored
community is higher than the indigen-
ous population perhaps twice as
high, or more but cold official fig-
ures are deceptive.
Here is just one set of facts, from
the colored side of the fence, which
has been analysed by Elizabeth Bur-
ney in her authoritative book, “Housing
on Trial.” In mid-1966 two-thirds of the
post-war housing estates in Wolver-
hampton were occupied by whites: only
one-fifth were occupied by colored
immigrants. But half the pre-war estates
were colored, and only one-third were
occupied by whites. Alderman Farmer
believes that the colored community
“prefer” to live together in the cheaper
and larger Victorian properties, but
having seen the newer white estates, I
know that if I were colored, I wouldn’t
prefer to live in an overcrowded slum.
Here is an example of violence that
I witnessed between white and colored
people in Wolverhampton. Last month,
a corporation bus edged into the wrong
lane at the lights in the centre of town;
a taxi swerved away to avoid an acci-
dent. It was a tiny incident. The bus
crew were Pakistani. The taxi-driver
was white.
As soon as the lights changed, the
taxi tore 100yds. down Lichfield Street,
pulling in front of the bus at the next
stop. “You stupid black bastard,”
screamed the taxi-driver, and flung open
the bus-driver’s door. The driver looked
down, told the taximan what to do
with himself, and slammed the door
in his face. A small, white crowd gath-
ered.
“Black bastard! Black bastard!”
screamed the taximan, now hurling his
body at the driver’s door as il he
loathed the bus itself rather than the
driver inside. The conductor got off
the back of the bus and tried to calm
the man down. The bus-driver opened
his door, reached for a large piece of
metal, and said nothing. Police in a
police car driving along the street
saw the taximan, still screaming abuse,
looked up at the bus-driver’s open door,
and drove on without stopping.
The bus-driver started his engine and
tried to drive off. The white spectators
still looked on, expressionless and silent.
The taxi-driver kicked the side of the
bus, cursed the driver again, and stood
in his path. Then the bus-driver put his
foot down hard on the accelerator. The
taximan scuttled back to his taxi, shak-
ing with anger. The crowd continued
shopping.
At the taxi rank by the railway
station, where the new immigrants are
known as “bags of coal,” the taxi-driver
met his mates. “What was he,” asked
one, “a Jamaican?” “No,” came the
reply, “a bleedin’ Pakistani.” The others
tutted their sympathy.
The taxi-driver previously worked on
the buses for nine years before he left
a month ago because he’d had enough
of working with Pakistanis.
“The Jamaicans are all right,” he told
me, “they try and live our way. But
these others seem to have a sly, foxy
way about them. If they could cut your
throat, they would. I mean they’re try-
ing to take over the buses. Their aim is
to take them over in five years and run
them their way. They’ve got their way
of fixing things. There’s this Indian
who’s a mayor in his own country, yet
he comes over here and takes money
off us working on the buses. Well, he’s
not doing it for love. He’s part of the
takeover.”
When councillors in Wolverhampton
say they don’t see any serious grounds
for complaint, either from immigrants
or whites, they must mean that they
don’t believe people can possibly behave
or feel like this taxi-driver. The differ-
ence between the people of Wolver-
hampton and the public figures who
represent them is that the people know
there’s a color problem and cannot cope
with it, whereas the councillors are in
a position to cope with the problem, but
refuse to believe it really exists. What
is so painful about Wolverhampton is
that it is a town that has lost its reason.
Tettenhall is a green middle-class sub-
urb of Wolverhampton. Practically no
colored people live there. Apart from a
handful of exceptions, everyone I talked
to in Tettenhall wouldn’t like colored
families in the area and, least of all,
next door, particularly as the country’s
going to the dogs as it is, and every one
of them’s pregnant and so unclean. Boys
from the local public school thought
their “manner” and “bearing” rather
degrading; middle-aged ladies in minis
didn’t mean anything “detrimental,” but
they really should have their own
“area;” and others, tied up with nannies
and the important business of the day,
were “frightfully sorry,” but simply
hadn’t the time to chat about “all that”
now. When I mentioned the word color
to some people it really was surprising
how many of them turned on their heels

out even a reply, or, come to that, a
goodbye.
Even Tettenhall has its small Work-
ings Men’s Club, and it at least allows
colored membership, even if there
aren’t any colored members to allow.
What would the club do if colored
people came to Tettenhall in numbers?
“Well, of course,” explained the secre-
tary, “the committee would have to
review the situation.” Nevertheless, if
Tettenhall is anything to go by, it is a
myth that color prejudice in this
country is solely due to the coarser
instincts of the working class. The
dockers may be on the march, but the
middle-class are in training.
Every society looks wistfully to the
distant future to cure the rottenness of
the present: if Wolverhampton is stub-
bornly creating a society which is head-
ing for a major race riot—and since the
underprivileged colored ghettos seem
destined to grow in size and disillusion,
I believe that it is—then is there at

least hope in the young? Does the
youth of Wolverhampton feel any differ-
ently from its parents?
“If we could only give children a
longer period in school,” said Jim Hard-
ing, the general secretary of the YMCA,
“then their friendship will be too deep
for even their parents to separate.” The
YMCA in Wolverhampton operates
mainly as a social service from dilapi-
dated rooms rented out to the Labor
Exchange during the day, and Mr.
Harding has opened up the rooms, and
his heart, to helping young immigrants.
His achievements have been remarkable,
but the club .has failed in one vital
respect: in eight years, the white kids
have consistently refused to integrate
with colored members. “The lot of
them,” said one white boy, “want burn-
ing.” He was 13.
“Perhaps we’re expecting results too
soon,” says Mr. Harding. “The fault’s
with us. We’re expecting them to love
each other because we say so.” But is
Anti-Powellites, plain and colored
it really any different in the schools?
Certainly, in other key areas appear-
ances can prove deceptive. One fac-
tory has both white and colored
members in its sports club, but one
cricket team is white and the other
colored, and one hockey team is white
and the other colored. At the Old Oak
pub both white and colored people are
regulars, but the whites sit in one room
and the coloreds sit in the other.
“People see what they want to see,”
explained Keith Rowley, a member of
Wolverhampton’s Remedial Teaching
Service, who has produced a thesis on
the social relations between white and
colored children that contradicts all
previous theories. Mr. Rowley’s survey
of 15 schools and over 1700 school-
children concludes that awareness of
racial differences starts as early as
seven. Three criteria were used: whom
would they choose to sit by in class,
whom would they choose to play with
in the playground, and whom would
they invite home to tea or to a party?
Of the Indian children 75 percent
chose their own nationality, as did 60
percent of the West Indians. But at
least 90 percent of the British children
of all ages chose British friends in all
three social situations. Mr. Rowley
says that the survey was conducted “in
a county borough in the West Mid-
lands.” One wonders whether he was
officially asked not to name the town,
for the county borough was Wolver-
hampton.
Mr. G. W. R. Lines, the Director of
Education, admits that schools in the
colored areas of the town are unable
to cope with the numbers of children
and that dispersal is inevitable. Every
day 13 buses distribute 550 children
to about 40 schools where accommoda-
tion is available. But Mr. Lines was
anxious to point out that a “fair
number” of those 550 children are
white. In fact, 538 of them are colored.
Dispersal in Wolverhampton wouldn’t
have been necessary had the council
realised that in creating colored ghettos
they were also creating colored schools.
It is these schools, badly overcrowded
and understaffed, that help give the
white community the impression that
they are becoming “strangers in their
own land.” For example, 23 of them
have a percentage of immigrant pupils
that is over the Government’s “ideal”
30 percent, and ten of these schools are
over 50 percent colored. But are the
colored children being genuinely dis-
persed throughout the town? There are
12 schools that have less than 1 percent
colored children. There aren’t any
colored children in 16 schools. Mr. Lines
explains that these schools are already
full. On June 20, Mrs. Rene Short,
MP for Wolverhampton North East,
complained in the Commons that 19
primary-school classrooms in Wolver-
hampton were empty. The school wait-
ing list is 400.
The white community of Wolver-
hampton believes that the waiting list
is full of white children, and the council,
who are constantly producing figures to
support the “burden” of immigration,
have done little to disillusion them. In
fact, practically every one of those 400
children is colored.
Perhaps it isn’t surprising that there
is so much color consciousness in the
schools, but how is it manifested?
Reverend Spratling’s Congregational
Church runs a youth club which, like
the YMCA, has tried and failed to
integrate the white kids with the
colored. Even in church, on Sunday
mornings, the white adult congregation
sits apart from the colored.
Although Reverend Spratling would
earnestly dance with colored girls at
club dances, the white members refused
to follow his lead. White girls who did
dance with colored boys were known
as “wogs’ birds.” Then, shortly after
Powell’s speech, several colored youths
threatened a white girl with a knife, the
police were called in, and, as the club’s
former youth leader, Gerald Peacock,
puts it, “the toleration level was killed
off.” Mr. Peacock has now given up
youth leadership, after 13 years in the
Salvation Army, for a job in Life Assur-
ance. The council has yet to appoint
one fieldworker to operate among
immigrant teenagers.
Only whites usually go to Reverend
Spratling’s youth club now, and I talked
to a group of them, most of whom were
at school, at the technological college,
or already at work. They were a bright
bunch, as frank as their parents had
been and just as bigoted.
“We don’t like darkies here,” said
one, making a kneeing action.
“He loves blacks, the vicar,” said
another. “But we’ll be taken over by
them soon. Enoch was right.”
What had Enoch said? There was
a pause. Then “The blood will flow—
that’s what he said.”
“That’s right,” added a schoolboy.
“He only went the long way round
saying send the lot back home. I mean
they do it in the gutter and then pull
the' chain to make it look good. Have
you seen the way they beat their
wives?”
“Have you seen their cars? You
don’t see any in minis, that’s all I
know.” said a 16-year-old who added,
“Black is black and you can’t change
that.”
“It’s the Government’s fault,” said a
15-year-old girl. “We ought to be free
to discriminate against anyone we
want.”
It continued for three hours: they
smell, they’re violent, they take our
jobs, they take our houses, they breed
like rabbits, they live off the country,
they cause disease, they don’t want to
mix, they’ve more rights than us, they
want their teeth kicking in, they’re
ignorant, they’re useless—but some of
our best friends are colored.
When they had finished, I asked one
boy, who was 17, if he was certain they
were being rational. “We’re just talking
at the moment,” he replied, “but they’re
walking all over us. We’ll fight back
sometime. And it’ll start then. The
riots. When we’ve run out of patience
we’ll just take a gun and shoot them.”


What’s another word for documentaries?
ONCE UPON a pre-television time,
a documentary was a shortish film about
an overnight mail train, or coal min-
ing, or the life of an eskimo. A con-
siderable mystique developed around it.
Names like Grierson and Flaherty were
the ones to drop, and the rather more
intellectual kind of film enthusiast used
to get as excited and argumentative
about them as he does these days about
hand-held cameras.
Nowadays, a lot of people are mak-
ing documentaries, or so they still call
them, for television. And for some so
far unexplained reason even more
people want to make them. Most of
these people, hopefully ringing up the
current affairs departments of television
stations with their breathless ideas, have
little or no experience in television,
film-making, or journalism, but they’re
convinced they can make a document-
ary.
Perhaps one of the reasons they ring
up is that documentaries look so simple.
You find a subject, investigate it, film
it, edit it, write a commentary, and
there you have it. Documentaries, too,
are respectable, unlike panel games,
quiz programs, cartoons, and commer-
cials. Being involved in documentary,
you can hear these earnest people
rationalising to their friends, is at the
same time preserving one’s intellectual
integrity and also coming to terms
reasonably with a necessary part of
modern life . . . etc. . . .
The trouble is that it’s not as simple
as all that. And four recent programs
on local television show how complex
the “documentary” business is becom-
ing. The word, in fact, will have
to be. scrapped. It’s perfectly adequate
as a kind of semantic portmanteau, but
the difficulty is that people are trying
to stuff too many concepts into it. They
just don’t fit any more.
The four programs were Bob Ray-
mond’s two-parter for “Project ’6B”
about organ transplants, Stefan Sar-
gent’s essay for the ABC on Groote
Island, and two “Seven Days” pro-
grams an attempt by Peter Wester-
way to examine the training of doctors,
and a profile of Lord Thomson of
Fleet by a team of his own countrymen
working for Canada’s National Film
Board.
Of the four programs, Stefan Sar-
gent’s “The Change at Groote” came
closest to what might be called “classi-
cal” documentary. His subject was real
enough; manganese mining on Groote
Island and its impact on the local
Aborigines. It was both topical and
relevant. But the things that made it
different from the other documentaries
were two: First, Sargent had an unmis-
takable point of view of his own; sec-
ond, he superimposed on the actual
situation a set of values which belonged
only to the medium he was using
picture and sound.
This may seem only like saying that
Sargent is an imaginative film-maker;
and so he is. But there’s more to it than
that. Given the flexibility of the mod-
ern 16mm. camera, it’s not particularly
difficult for a director (or his camera-
man) to be praised for “imagination”
on the basis of a series of technical
cliches like zooms and focus-pulling,
whether they’re used relevantly or not.
The point about this program of
Sargent’s was that his use of film and
sound was aimed directly at the point
he was making: that the rich physical
and spiritual landscape of Groote
Island is being irrevocably eroded by
the manganese mining. In image after
image after image and, importantly,
without any talking, except by the
people on the spot he created a
sense of irretrievable loss.
The strength of his piece was in the
feelings it left you with. It was about
an actual situation, but it wasn’t about
how many tons a day are mined, or
how much Aboriginal workers are paid,
or whether or not the north is becom-
ing a giant quarry any more than a
Drysdale is about land rights. “The
Change at Groote” was, if one can
use the phrase without sounding pre-
tentious about it, a work of art, and
no less that because it was about some-
thing that’s happening here and now,
and therefore a fit subject for docu-
mentary treatment.
Bob Raymond took the opposite
tack. His was a subject organ trans-
plants likely to generate much more
emotional energy than Sargent’s. But
where Sargent used his camera and
sound to create feelings, Raymond used
his tools objectively and appraisingly
as an extension of his own calmly
inquiring attitude. He set out after
information to discover what sort of
work Australian doctors are doing in
organ transplants and, more import-
ant, how they feel about the moral
and ethical problems involved. He suc-
ceeded brilliantly,
Raymond, indeed, was as clinical in
his approach as the doctors he watched
and talked to. Sargent was able to pro-
ceed almost intuitively, spontaneously
as his su hject took on a life and energy
of its own< R aymond) on the other
hand, seeking finally to get from doctors
their attitude to nothing less than
fundamental questions about life and
death, clearly worked to as calculated

The lesson of both these programs
is that there are at least two ways of
making what’s called a documentary,
One way is for the maker to look at
his material, take a strong point of
view about it, and then use his tools
the way a painter uses his brush, paints,
and canvas to create as powerfully
as he can with the medium at hand an
expression of his point of view. It’s a
risky business, but if it comes off the
result can be a work of art.
The other way, Raymond’s way in
this case, is to look at the subject and
record all the relevant material
pictures and people talking without

letting technique intrude on the subject
matter. It’s then a matter of shaping
the material and writing a script to
explain, summarise, and reinforce the
pictures and the interviews.
The Canadian way, in the film about
Lord Thomson, was different again.
Here was an approach which had some-
thing in common with both Sargent and
Raymond. This time, the camera was
again used as an onlooker, but it was
the selection of the things it looked at
rather than the way it looked at
them which gave the film its great
impact. It simply followed Lord
Thomson around and recorded the
way he behaved in different circum-
stances telling off-color jokes, snap-
ping at a subordinate, totally mystified
by a conversation with McLuhan.
As a counterpoint, it also recorded
his subordinates without Thomson
present, and looked at other people
talking about him. The scheme of the
film was anecdotal but each episode
was carefully chosen and sometimes
exquisitely juxtaposed with another to
make a total effect.
This is the kind of approach to mak-
ing documentaries that takes a great
deal of time and money, because a lot
of the material that’s recorded turns
out to be useless, either because better
material comes along or because later
material changes the shape of the pro-
gram and makes the early stuff irrele-
vant. One would guess that four-fifths
of the Thomson material was probably
thrown away, since the kind of stuff
that makes pertinent anecdotes occurs
only a few seconds at a time over
dozens of different occasions. But, time-
consuming and costly as it is, this way
of approaching a topic allows the sub-
ject or victim to be revealed as
layer after layer of personality is strip-
ped off and held up to the light.
The trouble with Peter Westerway’s
program on the training of doctors
was that he seemed unable to make up
his mind what the program was about
and this is perhaps the lesson for
all would-be documentary-makers.
Sargent revealed himself as a film
artist with a definite point of view
about a human problem: Raymond, in
this program at least, was a brilliant
reporter using film and sound as tools:
Westerway’s role, to put it bluntly,
was indefinable.
The program certainly looked at
young doctors in medical school, in
the teaching wards, in casualty, and, at
inordinate length, in the delivery room.
The camera stood objectively apart,
dispassionate, as it should have done
given the nature of the subject. But
that, virtually, was all. For what reason
we don’t know, but Westerway made
very little attempt to relate what we
were seeing to the questions that inevi-
tably arose out of what we saw. He
simply allowed long sequences of pic-
ture and sound to move past the eye
without in any way engaging the mind.
Out of all this, there are one or two
points more to be made. One is that
Stefan Sargent has realised that he’s
not only competing with expensive
American imports for the viewers’
attention. He’s also competing with
expensive local commercials. Sargent
may be an artist, but he doesn’t keep
his editing machines in an ivory tower.
Whether we like it or not, whether we
like them or not, the fact is that some
of the best film craftsmanship in Aus-
tralia at the moment is going into the
shooting, editing, and sound-mixing of
commercials. We’ve been conditioned
by the best of the commercials to
accept a new visual style. Sargent
knows this, and exploited it, some-
times with remarkable effect.
Another point is this. There’s a strong
belief among most television people
that “talking heads” people talking
direct to the camera make dull view-
ing and are to be avoided. (Camera-
men, particularly, feel strongly about
this because they get bored just stand-
ing about filming straight with no
opportunity to show off their tricks.)
Raymond showed quite conclusively
that there’s nothing dull about a talk-
ing head if something good is coming
out of it.
Raymond interviewed a young sur-
geon just after he’d taken seven hours
to put two artificial valves in a child’s
heart. One suspects he chose this time
to talk to him about life and death
and a surgeon’s responsibility because,
just having filmed the operation itself,
it was the perfectly appropriate moment,
psychologically and emotionally, to talk
to the man who had performed it.
Whatever the thinking behind it, this
was a “talking head” that was totally
compelling: a thoughtful, sensitive man,
talking freely, in the relaxed mood that
follows great strain, and great achieve-
ment, about something that concerned
him deeply.
Thus, it’s simply not enough these
days to take a camera, record some-
thing actually happening, and call it
a documentary, although 20 years ago
getting a slice of real life on moving
film was apart from newsreels
a rare enough event for it to be justi-
fied by its very existence. These days,
to compete with “The Champions” . . .
and “This Day Tonight” . . . you’ve
got to be an artist with a point of
view or a skilled journalist who knows
how to use his tools and how to use
people. Which is something those
people who are going to ring up tele-
vision stations this week with ideas
for documentaries might keep in mind.

Singapore’s attempt to find itself
From HARVEY STOCKWIN
LIKE AUSTRALIA, Singapore is a
nation of immigrants. As Lee Kuan
Yew put it, at the banquet honoring
Mr. Gorton, “Britain was one of the
greatest maritime powers, and the
journeyings of the British .have
incidentally helped to create modern
Australia and modern Singapore.”
As for Australia, so for Singapore,
the long-time British presence has been,
and has been allowed to be, a cushion
against reality. Now that this umbrella
will no longer hold off a good deal of
regional fall-out, both countries are
seeking, or should be seeking, to question
and reappraise their raison d’etre. For
Singaporeans, like Australians, there
has been, and there remains, too much
psychological “distance” between the
immigrants and those neighbors whose
migration to the area is of longer stand-
ing. Australia cannot be, or regard
itself as, merely a European offshoot, oi
offshore island. Singapore cannot be,
regard itself or be regarded, merely
as a third China. Cannot? Not if sur-
vival is the objective of foreign policy.
Unlike Australia, Singapore has not
got the benefit of (a little) distance
and remoteness with' which to buttress a
“she’ll be right, mate” philosophy. As
you fly toward Singapore it is often
difficult to distinguish the island upon
which you will presently land. As you
leave Singapore by sea, the maze of
islands leaves you distinctly aware that
this would be no place for Malaysia,
Singapore, and Indonesia to claim and
police a strictly 12-mile territorial
waters limitation for each nation.
Unlike Australia, too, Singapore has
a leadership which does not presume to
play upon the lowest common denomi-
nator of the community’s intelligence.
Instead, it adumbrates and articulates
the issues before it with a rationality
and frankness and depth which else-
where are reserved for. seminars. This
quality, together with the greater sense
of urgency, soon produced, once the
British pull-out decision was made, a
series of ministerial radio and television
talks on the “crucial years” immediately
ahead. Leaving aside the adequacy, or
otherwise, of the views therein ex-
pressed, and quite apart from whether
the listening and viewing populace
agreed with or even grasped all that
was said, the fact is that a clear, con-
cise, and, in many ways, compelling
response to the new situation was
quickly produced and presented at
a level closer to the HCF than the
LCM. Maybe this helped Singaporeans
decide to risk giving the governing
Peoples’ Action Party a 100 percent
majority. Most voters in most countries
would never get such a treat in the
first place.
While the style may be admirable
and repeatable the content naturally
is questionable. Opening the “crucial
years” series, Lee Kuan Yew laid it
down that “from a protected trading
centre of a vast empire, we must
become a self-reliant industrialised
nation-State responsible for our own
security.” Looking backwards, he saw
that “there was a prosperous and
thriving Singapore before the British
built their naval and air bases,” and,
looking forward, “there will be a throb-
bing and humming industrial, com-
mercial, and communications centre
long after the British bases have gone.”
On the one hand he was expressing
domestic intent; on the other, domestic
hope. Equally, the first quote is a state-
ment of foreign policy, the second of
what, that policy is intended to achieve.
Is it even policy? Can Singapore,
placed so delicately and strategically
within the South-East Asian fabric, ever
be substantially self-reliant? The
Republic would appear to brilliantly
illustrate the fact that no nation is an
island. And it is a bit difficult now to
remember because of their single-
minded intensity, when the Peoples’
Action Party leaders do a volte-face
they really volte that this new goal
is new, does represent a turnabout.
From the PAP’s inception in 1954 until
1964-65 the PAP premise was that their
island was not a nation.
On the economic side, merger with
Malaysia meant that the world’s fourth
largest port was politically linked to its
hinterland, Singapore industries to their
The Lee Kuan Yews and the John Gortons being neighborly in Singapore in June
most accessible market. More impor-
tant, on the politico-communal side
Malaysia was an unsuccessful attempt
to contain the pressures generated by
Malaya’s and Singapore’s multi-racial
composition within a single framework.
The creation of two frameworks does
not separate all the inter-reactions of
these pressures, but merely elevates in-
ternal problems into international
politics. To put it another way, while
separation may have prevented politi-
cal conflict from ending in a com-
munal clash, there is no guarantee that
Malaysia-Singapore relations could not
produce the same result.
Whereas yesterday, with the Barisan
Socialists on the ascendant, the
Malaysian-Malay leaders particularly
(but also the Malaysian Chinese lead-
ers), feared Singapore becoming an-
other “Cuba,” i.e., Communism with
Castro-like unpredictability, today their
apprehension is of a Singapore “Israel.”
Just as Israel is seen as an aggressive
beachhead of “Westernism” in an Afro-
Asian area (exponents of Israel-type
forces for Australia, please note) so the
apprehension is of Singapore-Chinese
assertiveness, or economic dominance,
in what is felt to be a Malay-Moslem
area. Similarly, the more sophisticated
and worldly wise Indonesians desire to
avoid forcing Singapore “toward
China’s embrace,” for which she is felt
to have a natural inclination, though,
unfortunately, there are many more
Indonesians who fail to realise that
Indonesia’s policies toward her own
“overseas Chinese” scarcely contribute
toward such avoidance. Likewise
Indonesian and Malaysian desires for
ASEAN togetherness conflict, in the
long run, with their desire to develop
their own industries to the exclusion
of Singapore products. They have a
sizable market, Singapore hasn’t. So
far, concern for Singaporean drift and
direction has not been noticeably tem-
pered with the realisation, in the words
of the song “who will Singapore turn
to if we turn away?”
But it is the politico-communal
attitudes which are most likely to deter-
mine the economic ones. For Singa-
pore’s part she must, in the words of
Foreign Minister Rajaratnam, “make
it clear to people inside and outside our
country that Singapore is not a Cuba,
or a Third China, or a Second India,
or America, or Russia, but just Singa-
pore.”
Even so, it remains a moot point
whether such “making clear” will ever
be enough to eliminate doubts. True,
of course, “that where religous pre-
judice has to be stirred up against
Singapore, then Singapore is Israel.
Where racial prejudices have to be
stimulated, Singapore is depicted as a
Third China. Where anti-Communist
fears have to be used, then Singapore
becomes Cuba.” True, too, to further

quote the Foreign Minister, that “there
are, of course, sound political motives
why some people get their geography
all mixed up.” But, as ever, political
motives, sound or otherwise, like racial,
religous, and political prejudices, find
their sustenance in political and
emotional reality.
In other words the insistence by
Rajaratnam and all his colleagues that
“Singapore is Singapore, and it is our
business to see that it stays that way,’’
while an admirable tenet of foreign and
domestic policy, still has to contend
with the fact that Singapore is also
what others see it as being. No doubt
what others see is partly what they
want to see. No doubt the facts of
demography matter as much as political
assertions of Singaporeanism by the
PAP. No doubt, too, that regard for
Singapore will be colored by the extent
to which Singaporean actions and
“Singaporeanism” can be made dis-
tinctively different from the prevailing
South-East Asian image of “Chinese-
ness” and can blend with the land-
scape even as the island does from the
air.
As things stand, while such attributes
as lack of corruption will, one hopes,
continue to stand out for South-East
Asian, and other, emulation, Singapore
is not infrequently as abrasive as a sore
thumb. None of her relations with her
four ASEAN neighbors can be really
termed “close” or “good.” This could
change, but other aspects of Singapore’s
acceptability would appear less easily
changeable.
Until such time, for example, as
Malays, Chinese, Ibans, Kadazans, and
Indians do blend, or integrate, into a
deeper awareness of being “Malaysian,”
Singapore’s 80 percent Chinese popula-
tion will still determine a good deal of
its image north of the Johore Cause-
way, even as that image helped deter-
mine separation in the first place. Com-
munal regard is indivisible, too, and
no amount of assertion will create a
new community called Singaporean
for outsiders, at least. Unhappily, too,
and as an extension of this, China will
determine how the Singaporeans are
regarded, despite the very obvious
differences between the thoughts of Mao
and those of Lee. While Djakarta looks
northward and sees a Peking bent on
rectifying the past errors of the PKI
it is unlikely that Indonesians will
wholeheartedly come to regard Singa-
poreans as Singaporeans. By the same
token, future flexibility by Peking,
taking advantage of Japan’s economic
weight and natural over-assertiveness,
might well make it easier for the PAP
to get its Singaporean message across.
As of now it remains more likely that
were China, in her current inflexibility,
to exert greater sway over the Nanyang
(southern seas), not only would the
Barisan Socialists’ self-imposed with-
drawal from Singapore politics pay
dividends but also Chinese chauvinism
would get a boost that Lee Kuan Yew
would never wish to give it.
Equally, the domestic, let alone ex-
ternal, policies pursued by Indonesia


and Malaysia particularly —not to men-
tion the wider regional situation in
which Singapore finds herself will
inevitably have their effect on the PAP
efforts to establish a Singapore identity.
Were these to be enlightened, and were
all to go well, especially economically,
then the Chineseness of Singapore (in
any case very different not just from
Mainland China, nor only Hong Kong
and Taiwan, but even from that of the
Malaysian Chinese) would mellow,
change, and diminish. Obviously, this is
a hell of a big “if.”
In short, the nexus between domestic
policies and external relations, between
internal and foreign action and reaction,
between how Singapore regards and
how she is regarded, is a particularly
fine one. Within Malaysia, separate or
remerged, Singapore will still have to
see herself more clearly, and pursue
policies geared to her region. For that
The jive ASEAN Foreign Ministers in session . . . “Singapore the sore thumb”
matter there is no alternative for Aus-
tralia but to gear her neighborhood
policies more to the regional than the
separate national realities.
The acid test for Singapore, in other
words, will not simply be, in Lee Kuan
Yew’s words, “for the first time we
must fight for ourselves . . . Have we
the will to be a nation? Have we the
grit?” A too strenuous going-it-alone
will only accentuate the Israel image.
The will of others will also be crucial
since they may be equally gritty.
This is not to argue that Singapore
has no control to exercise over its own
destiny, or no pressure to exert over
the destiny of the region. It does mean
that the problem of “survival” through
“the crucial years” is more complex
and difficult than even the PAP leader-
ship usually makes it out to be. For
one thing, domestic requirements often
run counter to regional ones. Defence
forces have to be organised, discipline
for economic advance to be imposed.
What is domestically desirable, indeed,
essential, can easily be externally
offensive, or repugnant.
Partly, the problem is style, partly
presentational, partly just Lee. When
the PAP pursues an ideal, as already
pointed out, they really pursue. Chas-
ing after “a rugged and robust society”
can so easily become counter-produc-
tive, as when, for example, the revo-
cation of Malaysian work permits pro-
duced one more Malaysia-Singapore
fracas earlier in the year. Unhappily,
Singapore’s capacity to offend and
not only Malaysia within and with-
out ASEAN has been illustrated not
infrequently.
It is not only the ends Singapore
pushily seeks, but the way she goes
about things which offends. At the
initial ASEAN conference in Djakarta
last August, Singapore evidently pro-
duced, out of the blue, some concrete
suggestions of a regional common mar-
ket. No diplomatic spade-work pre-
ceded the suggestion. Naturally, it got
nowhere, since it was outside the spirit
of the occasion.
If sometimes Singapore says too
much too brusquely, then other times
it fails by not bothering to say nothing
politely. At the five-power conference
in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore said very
little. Asked by conference chairman
Tun Razak to say something on the
last agenda item, future threats, Dr.
Goh Keng Swee said nothing. The
impression left with everybody, not
just the Malaysians, was, naturally,
that Singapore, having got all it could
out of the Brits, was attending the
conference just for old time’s sake.
Neither is offence only given locally,
The way Singapore set about holding
the Third Ministerial Conference on
South-East Asian Development last
April by unilaterally inviting ob-
servers from Australia, New Zealand,
India, Pakistan, and Ceylon scarcely
endeared her to some of her friends.
The conference is a Japanese creation
and they had no wish to see India and
Pakistan adding their never-ending
demands to this aid-club. If the
Japanese were irritated, then the
Australians and New Zealanders were
embarrassed, albeit, as far as could be
seen, not the Indians and Pakistanis.
Then there’s Mr. Singapore himself,
Lee Kuan Yew. By nature combative,
assertive, and abrasive, Lee can also be
charming and persuasive, especially to
(less thin-skinned) Westerners. But one
must question, still, whether he has got
what it takes to make Singaporeanism
accepted and acceptable. Equally, the
problem is not made any easier by the
paranoid hatred of him in some neigh-
borly hearts; the equally unfortunate
tendency of some neighborly (Chinese)
politicians to imitate Lee lock, stock,
•and barrel; by the fact that what some
regional leaders would really like, and
be satisfied with, is for local Chinese
leadership to construe survival in terms
of complete non-assertiveness plus the
political, and financial, equivalent of
greasing their palms.
Whatever Lee might do, however,
he might “mature” —if he gave more
freedom to his human warmth which
he has seemingly suppressed—such a
concept is a complete non-starter. Still,
there are signs of progress. This month
Lee attended the new Sultan of Brunei’s
coronation. So did the Malaysia’s Tunku
Abdul Rahman, so did Tun Razak, to-
gether with representatives of the
“feudal” aristocracy Lee once decried
to such cost. Last year he attended a
royal wedding, also in Brunei. Natur-
ally this hobnobbing is not remote
from Singaporean self-interest—Brunei
might find it advantageous to hire more
contract labor from, and give more
contracts to, Singapore. The point is
that Lee is hobnobbing, and what is
needed is more of it.
On the other hand, a top Filipino
senator tells me he has invited Lee
to the Philippines to, among other
things, lecture the students there. Leav-
ing aside the current diplomatic dif-
ficulties between Kuala Lumpur and
Manila over the Sabah claim and even
considering them, the advantages of re-
sponding to this invitation are obvious,
especially as it would be a contact-
creating, image-building, non-official
opportunity for the frank speaking which
could win him more neighborly friends.
At the moment Singapore has not even
a consul in Manila.
Similarly Lee must, before too long,,
visit Djakarta. That he hasn’t and
doesn’t, is a good illustration of Sing-
apore’s difficulties. It is said that if
Lee goes, Singapore and Malaysian
Chinese will react to his meeting with
those whose relations with their own
Chinese are suppressive, to say the
least. But, then, if Lee persists in visit-
ing Western, rather than neighborly
capitals such as Djakarta, he will only
enhance the feeling of Singapore’s
“Chineseness.” If Kuan Yew and his
Ministers are serious about Sing-
aporeanism it would seem necessary that
he takes the plunge, indicating larger-
than-just-Chinese calculations.
But then, even as promoting Sing-
aporeanism is very necessary, so it is
also premature. As Acheson said of
Britain, Singapore has lost an empire
but not yet found a role. The island
republic can become a regional “spark-
plug,” to use Lee’s term, but, in order
to do so, it will have to seek ways to be
a regional catalyst rather than pursuing
paths which make it a regional standout.
Will and grit have been demonstrated
by the PAP. The acid test would
appear to be whether Singapore, while
keeping in step with itself, can yet keep
in step with its frequently more sedate,
often less energetic, but no less prickly,
neighbors. The drive which is often
admired needs more delicate expression.
The tragedy would be if the same con-
tentiousness, which produced Sing-
apore’s independence in the first place,
were to continue to inhibit its growth.

BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
Accepting a surgical cure for the sugar industry
Sugar in store —some 300,000 tons a
year too much
ALTHOUGH THE IDEA was re-
jected last April, Australia now seems
on the point of accepting the 28 per-
cent cut in sugar exports to the free
market as proposed in Geneva by
the secretary-general of the UN Con-
ference on Trade and Development,
Dr. Prebisch. Acceptance would mean
cutting this year’s estimated harvest of
2,565,000 tons of raw sugar by as much
as 300,000 tons in future.
Along similar lines, South Africa is
being asked to make a 26 percent cut
and other major producers an average
10 percent cut in their shipments to
the free market. The scheme is aimed
at raising the world’s sugar price from
its present doldrums of £l9 a ton to
around £32 a ton. If that is achieved,
Australia’s cut in exports to the free
market from the present 1.37 million
tons to the proposed 1.1 million tons
would in fact mean an increase in ex-
port earnings of some £9 million. There
will no doubt be some squeals to come
as the knife is applied. But it would
seem that the world’s major sugar pro-
ducers are getting so sick and tired of
selling below the cost of production
that they have at last reached a point
where they are willing to make some
sacrifice in order to secure a higher
price.
For some the sacrifice has been im-
posed. Frost in Brazil, drought in
Peru, the Caribbean area, and the
Philippines have taken their toll of
recent crops. Argentina has adopted
the novel attitude that sugar for ex-
port is too profitless a business and
is reducing production accordingly.
South Africa has announced plans to
restrict production by 10 percent. A
similar reduction in Australian produc-
tion resulting in a healthier and more
profitable industry would seem to be
more than could have been hoped for
in view of the excessive and short-
sighted expansions of the past eight
years.
Australian producers have, in effect,
only managed to stay in business be-
cause of the special agreements, such
as that between Commonwealth coun-
tries, and regional sales arrangements
with Japan and the U.S. which have
guaranteed the disposal of a sufficiently
large part of the total production at
specially negotiated prices. Such agree-
ments accounted for 540,000 tons of
raw sugar last year and there is little
hope of expanding them. Australian
producers have also been greatly
assisted by a high guaranteed domes-
tic price in the home market—some
600,000 tons last year and increasing
very slowly indeed.
The rest —some 1.37 million tons last
year—was shovelled regardless into the
world market, creating a free-for-all
in which consumer countries have been
able to take their pick at knock-down
prices. The prices so created have
appeared virtually bottomless over the
past two years, with a large part of the
supply pressures coming from the re-
export of Cuban sugar from Eastern
Europe and from the rising surpluses
of the beet sugar producers in Western
Europe.
After months of haggling and bar-
gaining the pressures of the situation
are at last forcing a conclusion. The
Australian industry has now indicated
that it is facing up to the prospect of
having to cut its disposals on the free
world market, but with mixed feelings.
There is, of course, faint hope here
that the imminent surpluses may be
dealt with without recourse to surgery.
There has been a steady increase in the
use of sugar and molasses for animal
feeding, and it is of interest to pro-
ducers of alcohol, glycerine, and other
industrial chemicals, but only at the
low prices currently prevailing on the
world market. There seems no escap-
ing the fact that the Australian indus-
try must face up to the necessity of
cutting back its acreage under sugar-
cane. How this is done rather than
whether this should be done ought to
be the main concern now.
TARIFF BOARD
BATTLING ON
THE COMMONWEALTH TREAS-
URY DEPARTMENT makes it per-
fectly clear in its annual pre-Budget
review of the economy that key tools
of economic policy lie in the hands
of other Government agencies. It
cannot, at this time, be expected to do
anything about inflation, for example.
The rate of inflation is, at present, de-
termined by 'the policies of the Arbitra-
tion Commission, since there are no
demand-pull pressures on prices. The
rate of price increase is determined
almost entirely by the extent to which
the Commission grants wage, increases
in excess of the rate of growth of pro-
ductivity. And productivity, which is at
the root of economic growth generally,
is not subject to much influence by the
Treasury. The Government agency with
the great responsibility for productivity
and growth is the Tariff Board.
Within the broad framework of pro-
moting full employment and economic
growth and dispensing some sort of
justice, the Government allows these
bodies to go about their work in their
own way, determining their own pro-
cedures and standards. But, there is a
remarkable contrast between the Com-
mission and the Board in the way they
are facing up to challenges of the
times. The Commission, burying its
head in the sand, continues to insist that
it need only consider its cases in isola-
tion, that the task is simply to determine
each case on its merits and to find some
sort of compromise between the two
warring parties.
The Tariff Board used to approach
its job this way, too. It took references
from discontented local manufacturers,
listened to them and to representatives
of importers, and then recommended a
rate of tariff which would be reasonably
satisfactory to each. In the process it
ignored entirely the follow-through
effects on the rest of the economy,
through raising costs for other firms. It
made no estimate of the effect it was
having in diverting resources from one
area of activity to another, or in affect-
ing the productivity of the economy.
The Arbitration Commission seems to
be making no moves whatever to bring
its methods into line with the times.
The Tariff Board on the contrary is
doing just that, even in the face of a
virulent campaign against it.
In Adelaide last week Tariff Board
chairman, Mr. G. A. Rattigan, outlined
the basis for the new procedures:
“The objective to which the tariff is


primarily directed is economic growth.
The capacity of the economy to support
rising standards of living is related
directly to the growth of real national
wealth. The contribution which pro-
tected industries make to increasing pro-
ductivity and to national economic
growth, their effects on internal costs
and prices and on external viability, de-
pends on how efficiently they use re-
sources.
“It may help clarify this formulation
of tariff making it the Board’s respon-
sibility toward the economy as a whole
is compared with that of a businessman
toward his firm. A businessman works
to maximise the benefits to his firm
from its use of the resources available
to it. In the same way the Board’s task
is to ensure that its recommendations
are consistent with a policy which seeks
to maximise the benefits to the com-
munity, resulting from the use of re-
sources in economic activities requiring
tariff protection.
“Any tariff affects the normal forces
of the market place. The Board’s con-
cern is to ensure that the existence of
tariffs promotes the interests of the
economy as a whole, which may not on
occasions coincide with the interests
of individual producers.
“The first classification of industries
by levels of protection will be based
simply on nominal ad valorem rates
of duty. The Board wants, systematic-
ally, to refine this classification by
adopting new measures as the necessary
statistical information can be made
available. It wants to work out “effec-
tive rates of protection” which cal-
culate the significance of protection for
raw materials used in the manufacture
of a protected item. In addition, it
wants to be able to follow through the
economy the way in which products
are used by other industries.”
And for this he needed up-to-date
and detailed input-output statistics.
The Bureau of Census and Statistics
in Canberra has been working on these
for at least ten years now, but only the
sketchiest tables have been produced.
Another table based on 1962-63 will
be produced next year, but a table for
1968-9 will not be ready on present
rates of progress until the mid-’7os.
Strangely, the Treasury Department
is reported to have blocked the recruit-
ment of new staff for this work, the
reason no doubt why Mr. Rattigan has
come out publicly and asked for it to
get a higher priority:
“The most appropriate analytical
framework for the Board’s review of
tariffs would be a reasonably up-to-
date input-output table of the economy
prepared by the Bureau of Census and
Statistics with the commodity and in-
dustry classifications in the table re-
concilable with the Australian tariff
classification. Apart from its use to the
Board such an input-output table would
provide all interested parties with a
basis for scrutinising the Board’s work
as a whole, and for assessing the likely
effects of its specific recommendations.”
MEN AND MATTERS
IN THE HOT SEAT in the last few
weeks has been Mr. Raymont Moore,
chairman of R. Fowler Ltd., who is
leading a spirited defence of the 131-
year-old vitreous china sanitaryware
business now being bid for by the
Royal Doulton group, of England.
Mr. Moore strongly believes that
majority ownership of Australian indus-
try should be in the hands of Austra-
lians. He has no objections to overseas
partners, provided they are in a minor-
ity position; otherwise, there is a temp-
tation for a majority overseas partner
to drain off profits from Australia by
way of such devices as service fee
charges, if their other areas of interest
are not currently profitable.
But his major reason for resisting the
British bid for R. Fowler is more per-
sonal, and stems from his nursing the
company out of the depression of the
’thirties. The Union Bank, as it was
Raymont Moore
Don Jackson
then, called him in and asked him to
act as receiver for R. Fowler. He
refused that appointment, but asked to
go in as a director, and he has been
chairman now for 38 years. He quickly
pulled it out of its financial difficulties,
and the company has paid continuous
dividends since 1934, of not less than
7 percent. There were bonus issues in
1954 and 1959.
The only job he has had in life,
excluding war service, was in account-
ancy. He joined Smith Johnson as an
office boy of 15 in 1911. In World War
I, he served as a signaller in France,
won the Military Medal in 1918, at
Bapaume, in the final push, and was
severely wounded. He returned to Smith
Johnson in 1919, continued with his
studies, and was admitted as one of the
six partners in 1930.
When the founder of Smith Johnson
and Co., F. J. Smith, died, he became
senior partner. He has now retired from
partnership, but remains as financial
consultant to the enlarged group, now
called Peat Marwick Mitchell and Co.
He has built up a string of director-
ships, almost without equal in Aus-
tralia, the most notable of which are
Newbold, James Stedman, Associated
Securities, Australian Gypsum, Gil-
bert Lodge, Penfolds, Ford Shering-
ton, Woolcord Fabrics, J. Fielding,
Ansett Transport, T. A. Field, and
Hongkong Finance Ltd.
The accounts of many of these bear
his mark of conservatism. The ex-
perience of the ’thirties made him adopt
cautious financial policies, not incurring
liabilities which in the event of a reces-
sion could cripple the company, paying
reasonable dividends, but financing
much of the growth from within.
That very conservatism has con-
tributed to the vulnerability of R.
Fowler to takeover.
YOU DON’T HAVE TO scratch long
around Tom Price country to come
across an old warrior. So when Briga-
dier Donald Jackson decided recently
to pack his kit at Puckapunyal, the last
in a long line of Army stations coming
under his command, and make for the
iron-ore country to be 'Hamersley’s
chief liaison officer, he found himself
in familiar territory.
His new job of oiling the public in-
spection works of the mighty complex
was formerly the care of Neville Bailey,
a former South African Air Force
officer, who stays on as his lieutenant
in what he thinks is God’s own part of
Australia. In a show run with military
precision, with all the attributes of a
landing operation on a foreign shore
(object being to slice off the top of
hematite hills for export to Japan),
one of Jackson’s superiors is also an
Army man, John O’Neill, manager at
Dampier, though not like Jackson a
regular.
O’Neill came into the company via
the University of Sydney (of which he
speaks nostalgically) and Broken Hill
South.
At the other end of the railway line,
his counterpart at Tom Price, the min-
ing township, is George Mackay (who
like O’Neill is in his early forties), a
South African mining engineer who
graduated from Witwatersrand Uni-
versity and subsequently busied himself
on his native country’s goldfields before
coming over here to join CRA at
Broken Hill as underground superin-
tendent. He is also a comparatively new
boy in the Pilbara, having joined
Hamersley only last year.
Commanding the whole Hamersley
army in the field (the managing direc-
tor, Mr. Russ Madigan, is at rear HQ
in Collins Street) is Tom Barlow, in
his late thirties, and like O’Neill an
engineering graduate from the Univers-
ity of Sydney. Mr. Barlow has been in
the thick of the fray at Tom Price from
the beginning, that is, from 1965, when
he was with the CRA’s planning team
in central engineering services. His first
job with the group was at Zinc Corpor-
ation, where he stayed for eight years
before going the beach sands and
uranium rounds. Just at present he is
on an advanced management course at
Honolulu.

BRITAIN
AMERICA HURRAH?
INTENT ON attracting any capital
investment it can, Australia occasion-
ally takes time off to voice qualms on
the increasingly dominant role America
is playing in the nation’s economy,
makes half-hearted demands for more
equity participation, and leaves the
matter at that. France continues its
attacks on the dollar. Britain, on the
other hand, has representatives from
its Board of Trade permanently in-
stalled in New York intent on attract-
ing as much U.S. investment to the
U.K. as they can. With such national
institutions as Cooper’s Oxford Marma-
lade, Smith’s Crisps, and Vick’s Vapor
Rub already gone over to the other
side, Britain has stopped lamenting the
big American takeover and is asking,
rather, what are the advantages and
disadvantages involved and when and
how a stop should be called.. The Board
of Trade is itself encouraging the new
approach with a two-year study of the
extent and consequences of American
investment.
Between 1950 and 1960 American
investment in Britain soared 600 per-
cent from £3OO million to £2020 mil-
lion. Of that, £1307 million was taken
up in manufacturing and distribution,
including £271 million in cars, £4OO
million in electrical and mechanical
engineering, £245 million in consumer
industries and distribution, and £134
million in chemicals.
On the credit side of all this is the
devastatingly successful export per-
formances of American companies in
Britain. They may be accounting for
only about 6 percent of the gross
national product there, but they are
providing 17 percent of manufacturing
exports. But in this the British find
room for disquiet, too. Quite simply,
they note that American companies are
better at making more profits and
exporting than the average British
company. Looking further afield, they
note that American investment in the
Common Market is now growing at a
faster rate than it is in Britain. Pre-
sumably, the American companies there
will achieve similar exporting records.
Obviously the competition is going to
get very tough indeed.
At the same time, American invest-
ment in Britain raises the standard of
living there. America is affluent
because production per worker is 80
percent higher than in Britain. The
efficiency rubs off. British workers in
American companies are more produc-
tive, and consequently take home fatter
pay packets. But, more importantly,
the arrival of the American companies
in force has become the long-awaited
catalyst for rationalisation and mod-
ernisation in British industry itself. The
Americans bring not just capital but
new manufacturing processes, and the
latest techniques, too. Along with Aus-
tralia, Britain faces one of its greatest
problems in the poor quality of much
of its industrial management. To their
credit, most American companies in
Britain employ locals at the highest
levels, and these men are then able to
tap a source of knowledge that is
otherwise not readily available.
The only solid argument against
the American investment would seem to
be that involving loss of autonomy. In
the extreme this is the idea that
American business will come to dom-
inate key sectors of the economy in
such a way as to create a serfdom
under a super-industrial power.
The pattern of American investment
is changing. Overseas subsidiaries were
once allowed to perform as best they
could. A good profit was expected but
in outlook they were little different
from indigenous rivals. Nowadays the
American giant looks upon its opera-
tions in global terms. Research will be
apportioned among the subsidiaries,
with each concentrating on particu-
lar aspects. Export policy will be
determined by the head office in
America.
The danger for Britain is that deci-
sions made outside the country could
vitally affect the performance of its
economy. It is perfectly conceivable,
for instance, that Ford should decide to
redistribute its export balance in favor
of its German subsidiary.
The area that worries most obser-
vers is technology. Few British com-
panies have the resources to match the
research of American giants. Yet the
relation between high research expen-
diture and high profit seems to be
drawing steadily closer. It is possible
that the giants of the future will be
those companies capable of producing
the most new ideas and then harness-
ing them at top speed.
Britain faces its dilemna squarely
enough. The rate at which its standard
of living is increasing is admitted to
be poor; without American invest-
ment it would be knocked sideways.
Yet, if this investment continues un-
abated, there is a real prospect of
American companies dominating those
areas of industry that are likely to be
the mainspring of future industrial de-
velopment.
Stopping American investment is
unthinkable. Britain is considering
rather how to meet it, compete with
it, and flourish alongside it. There is
a trend toward the sort of industrial
groupings that can get somewhere near
competing. But, it’s not enough.
In the end the solution is seen as
political. The problem is common to
all Europe, and Europe will get no-
where until it finds some way of
creating major industrial groupings that
ignore political frontiers. The answer
could lie in the Common Market or
in the North Atlantic Free Trade Area.
But one thing is recognised for cer-
tain. If Britain remains a lonely un-
attached island, there is a good chance
of it becoming one of the Western
Hemisphere’s great under-developed
regions.

NOISE
INDUSTRY'S "BOMB"
NOISE IS an industrial hazard too
long ignored in Australia, although
there has 'been some recognition of
the “time-bomb” that damaged
hearing represents in Australian in-
dustry. But there is little understanding
of the possible size of the eventual ex-
plosion.
In the U.S., the bomb has already
gone off. Under State laws, the now
routine compensation claims for in-
dustrial deafness can cost a company as
little as $U.5.3500 in Virginia and as
much as $U.5.22,500 in Hawaii. The
extent of the problem is frightening.
A survey of industrial deafness carried
out among 5000 workers in a U.S.
oil refinery in 1965 found that 59 per-
cent of boilermakers were affected, 51
percent of welders, 50 percent of sheet-
metal workers, and 40 percent of
machinists. It has since been suggested
that something like 10 percent of the
entire industrial population has suf-
fered damage to hearing.
A court case for compensation can
be an exceedingly complex affair: con-
siderations of the noise levels at which
deafness occurs, the state of the claim-
ant’s hearing before his current em-
ployment, the establishment of standard
hearing tests using standard instru-
ments, the evaluation of disability, and
the detection of malingerers are some
of the problems. But the basic ground-
work to solve them is being established
in many countries, as is complex legis-
lation to control industrial noise.
Legislation in Germany has imposed
stringent maximum noise levels on var-
ious items of machinery creating ex-
pensive redesign problems for manu-
facturers at home and importers from
abroad. In Austria, legislation involves
the isolation of noisy processes again
more expense and in Brazil it is re-
quired by law that workers in noisy
environments should be payed bonuses
in relation to the noise level.
In Britain, the groundwork for
stringent noise legislation is being laid
very thoroughly indeed. Apart from the
Wilson Report on noise of 1963, the
Government has just completed a
£120,000 investigation of its own, the
Science Research Council has poured
£350,000 into the subject over the past
four years and a similar amount has
been spent on establishing an Institute
of Sound and Vibration Research. Local
authorities have rallied to their
Minister’s call for a determined attack
on industrial noise, and next year re-
ports are to be called for with a view to
changing the law.
British industry has accepted the
writing on the wall and has begun
to quieten itself down, with a good lead
being given by the American companies
there. Esso, at one refinery alone, has
spent £500,000 to date in the process.
But, as other firms are beginning to
realise, too, when the time-bomb finally
goes off, it is going to be very expensive,
and early action will soften the blast.

Speculator’s Diary
CHEAP AND PATRIOTIC
SPECULATION
ON THE OIL BOARDS
WHEN THE NEW marketable parcels
legislation was introduced last June,
cries were heard that the little man was
being shut out of the market. Although
it is likely that some investors have
ceased to place small orders, those
which are placed are generally com-
pleted without difficulty so, provided
your broker will accept your order, a
small flutter on the market is still
possible.
On the other end of the trading
ladder, it is a pity that the Stock
Exchanges have not seen fit to reduce
the scale of commissions on the larger
orders. The present scale is 2 percent
on the first $lO,OOO, percent on the
next $40,000, and 1 percent on that
amount exceeding $50,000 and the
concessional rates apply only to a single
order in the same class of share. There
are, indeed, few investors who are able
to take advantage of the concessions.
However, if, for example, the scales
were altered to 2 percent on the first
$2OOO, percent on the next $BOOO,
and 1 percent on that amount exceeding
$lO,OOO, I feel sure that the increase
in brokers’ business would more than
compensate for their reduced commis-
sions. Stocks such as BHP, CRA, and
WMC would immediately become more
popular, and could even become attrac-
tive to the in-and-out trader.
Two of the features of the industrial
market during the past week were the
sharp increase in G. J. Coles’ profit
(up 13.2 percent to $lO.l million)
and the good gain by David Jones’
shares (up 19 cents to $1.66, after
touching $1.75). I therefore decided
to scan the boards for one of the
cheaper retailers, and eventually
settled on Nock and Kirby.
Although the name Nock and Kirby
to most people means the city and
suburban hardware stores of the same
name, the company’s interests are, in
fact, a little more diversified. The com-
pany owns Beard Watson and Com-
pany (its three floors are leased), and
has interests in an outboard-motor and
chain-saw manufacturing company, and
an investment company.
Nock and Kirby’s earning rate has
been anything but spectacular over
the past three years the return on
ordinary capital has remained pretty
constant at slightly over 10 percent
(10.2 percent in 1967), giving only a
fair cover to the annual 1\ percent
dividend. However, the company ap-
pears to have shown a reasonable im-
provement in profit and sales in the
half year to February 29, 1968 ap-
parently Beard Watson’s and the Nock
and Kirby’s Blacktown store (both
completely modernised last year) are
now making a more material contribu-
tion to profits. It is also expected that
the current enlarging of the company’s
store in the Westfield shopping centre
at Hornsby will aid profits in the near
future.
Perhaps the much-improved outlook
for the building industry and the
generally favorable retail trading
conditions now prevailing will help
Nock and Kirby out of the “10 per-
cent doldrums” with this in mind
(and the $2.84 net asset backing), I
decided to buy 400 shares.
My second purchase for the week
is Basin Oil, which has received a
considerable amount of unfavorable
criticism from the Press during the
past month or so. The flotation of
this company conveniently coincided
with the end of the 1968 financial
year (with substantial tax benefits to
subscribers). However, although the
company floated without any oil
leases, I think that the idea of ob-
taining farm-in agreements is quite a
sound one. The company has a cap-
able board of directors and is unlikely
to participate in any leases which
don’t show reasonable promise the
company has nearly $2 million
available for exploration and can
afford to be choosy.
On another note, much criticism has
been levelled at the Government for
allowing such a high level of overseas
participation in our oil and mineral
developments. Here is a company
which will help increase the level of
Australian participation in oil ven-
tures, and immediately the knockers
are out in full force. Anyway, at cur-
rent prices, Basin Oil represents the
cheapest speculation on the oil boards
and this in itself makes it a good
buy another recommendation is that
the company is likely to announce the
acquisition of two farm-in agreements
in the next couple of weeks. After
unsuccessfully trying to buy options
up to 10 cents, I eventually settled
for 2000 shares at 21 cents.
Following a slight recovery in Ralta’s
shares, I decided to realise a loss on
these.

BRIEFLY
77)6 economy: The National Bank predicts that Aus-
tralian export production, aided by minerals, seems certain
to rise considerably in 1968-69, unless seasonal prospects
deteriorate unexpectedly.
Australia is being asked to reduce its free market
sugar exports by 28 percent, in an effort to secure a new
International Sugar Agreement.
Australia ended the financial year with total reserves
of $1,092.4 million, a fall of $105.9 million, reflecting
the impact of sterling devaluation last November.
The morkets: Dr. Coombs’ optimistic pronouncements
about Australia’s economic future gave some encouragement
to industrials on Australian share markets, but minerals
and oils, after a firmer start, drifted uncertainly, waiting
for results to catch up with speculators’ hopes.
All ordinaries index moved up a couple of points, oils
dropped a couple, while non-ferrous metals strengthened
from 3523.73 to 3552.53.
CSR added 22c to $6.32, Minster dropped 5c to $1.20,
BHP finished 50c cheaper at $23.50. CRA put on 60c
to $19.90, Mt. Lyell 23c to $2.58, after hitting $3.10,
Great Boulder slipped $1.30 to $14.20, WMC was
60c down on the week to $13.30. In the oils, Magellan gained
90c to $5, Oil Search 9c to $1.39, and Woodside 15c to
$2.15 . . . There was a special sale of 278,000 APCM
shares at $1.25.
In this relatively cautious, speculative market, new floats
are not what they used to be. Basin Oil, 20c paid with
separate options, came on at 21c, but climbed to 25c,
while the free options strengthened from 5c to 16c.
A Court of Appeal ruling caused confusion over N.S.W.
law, and the Sydney Stock Exchange froze stock option
trading on Friday.
Heavy selling, partly prompted by Wall Street’s set-
back, had wiped millions of pounds from paper values of
industrial shares on the London Stock Exchange
by the end of last week. The index slumped 9.5 points to
467.3 on Friday, when even the finest quality stocks were
pulled down, giving a fall of 25.2 points for the week.
Dull trading in a mixed market closed the week on Wall
Street. Declines gradually took the upper hand again
when no wide support materialised. This surprised
analysts who had felt that encouraging business and
financial news would have at last steadied the market.
Companies: The traditional openers with the year’s re-
sults, the financiers, reported buoyant business. AGC
profit rose 13 percent, Custom Credit improved 17 per-
cent . . . Trade Credits bumped up profit 21 percent to
$270,458 in the year to June, giving earning rate of 36.9
percent . . . Lend Lease profit rose 10 percent to
$1.7 million and is making a one-for-ten bonus.
Ninth successive profit advance was recorded by Paynter
and Dixon, with a profit of $411,000 ... A 13 percent
profit boost put G. J. Coles’ 1967-68 profit at $lO.l million,
allowing an increase in dividend to 11.6 percent . . .
Under siege from the developers, The Hotel Metropole
lifted dividend from 15 to 17| percent, reporting improved
profit of $235,000.
Profit of Hardie Holdings fell fractionally to $636,000 . . .
Profit of Sunbeam Corporation dipped $| million to
$l.l million in the year to February . . . Price-cutting
slashed 16 percent off Hecla’s profits in the year to April,
when profits fell to $398,000 . . . Flour-miller and
baker Gillespie Brothers Holdings suffered a 42
percent profit fall in the year to April . . . Despite
recent market optimism, Minster’s 1968 news was not
bright; profit fell from $996,000 to $613,000, and dividend
has been halved to 10 percent.
Brickworks Ltd. raised more than $5.8 million by a place-
ment of 750,000 shares at $8.20 each, and 83,200
contributing shares at $4.20 each. The object of the fund-
raising is not yet known . . . Frozen Food will raise $150,000

Pacific Corporation placed 700,000 5 percent preference
shares and 140,000 ordinary shares (at 53c premium)
in A. J. Chown with institutions.
The consortium of Sydney firms bidding for Vanderfield
and Reid is revealed as Bancor Pty. Ltd., Development
Underwriting, Realty Development and Mortgage, Hooker
Corporation, Duncans Holdings, DFC, and an unidentified
private company, FBF Pty. Ltd . . . Nylex Corporation
is joining Armstrong Cork Co. of U.S.A. in a joint
venture to make resilient flooring products and
accessories . . . Thiess plan a $lO million joint venture to
assemble White trucks in Brisbane for the American

over four years to expand its copper output, part to be
financed by a rights issue. With EZ, it will build
a $l4 million sulphuric acid plant at Burnie. EZ and
Mt. Lyell will put up $2 million each.
Utah will develop a coal export industry based on the
Goonyella field (142 miles south-west of Mackay),
involving the expenditure of $lOO million on railway
and port, mining, and township facilities . . . The con-
sortium of Pickands, Mather and Co., Kaiser Steel, and
Conzinc Riotinto of Australia (UK) decided not to
proceed with a plan to take 90 percent interest in the
Associated group’s Bluff coal deposits . . . The Oppenheimer
group, Anglo-American, shied off talks with Silver Valley

THE LAND
Fewer farmers need
a bigger voice
NOBODY IS MORE aware than Mr.
McEwen that falling numbers of rural
workers are the counterpart to the
growing productivity in farming. As,
over the years, numbers of rural workers
and proprietors have dwindled, Mr.
McEwen has relentlessly followed a
course which, if not on all fours with
the one Mr. Charles Court is now
leaning heavily toward in his effort to
project minerals development in West-
ern Australia in a national image, is
strikingly similar in some respects. One
common factor in their designs for these
now highly capital-intensive industries is
that, as, they carry the ever heavier load
of the country’s export responsibilities
on their dual backs, they are entitled to
preferential treatment in their income
and capital claims on available re-
sources.
In Mr. Court’s case, the emphasis is
strongly on capital, and he has put an
irresistible case for a new deal between
the Federal and State Governments in
loan money allocations. Bearing in mind
the huge sums of private capital, pre-
ponderantly from overseas, being
poured into the Pilbara, say, and the
high head of export steam this is
building up for the country as a whole,
his case seems to put those of cosseted
Premiers in the south-eastern States —
seeking priority for capital develop-
ments in their overblown cities in
the shade. In Mr. McEwen’s eye, the
idea all along has been to see that,
come hell or high export, and even
local weather, farmers’ incomes keep
that up with those of the secondary and
tertiary Joneses in Australia. This isn’t
to say that Mr. McEwen has neglected
to press the claims of rural areas for a
fair share of Government loan money,
or for Budget concessions to make rural
investment more attractive. But the
maximisation of farmers’ net income
has been his primary objective. Pos-
sibly the Minister of Trade wouldn’t
have put this policy quite as bluntly as
Mr. F. J. McAvoy, the National Farm-
ers’ Union president, did at the pre-
Budget industry representations to the
Government recently.
Obviously, Mr. McAvoy thinks the
Australian farmer must • never be
allowed to be the victim of economic
change. For, among other things, his
message to Cabinet abhorred the
adoption of a “hard line” toward
primary industries, a line which “would
leave them bear as best they can the
costs of national development (presum-
ably meaning the costs of providing the
necessary export income to succour
national development) and to partly
McEwen ... “you are enormously
important in the economic sense”
dismantle those systems which have
compensated for change. He added
that, coupled with the various forms
of Government assistance to primary
industry, the stabilisation schemes had
made possible good quality produce
standards.” Such frankness is nothing
new for industry spokesmen, especially
those who still see the Australian
economy “riding on the sheep’s back.”
Though Mr. McAvoy (like Mr.
McEwen at the signing of the merger
agreement between the Victorian
division of the APPU and the Victorian
Wheat and Woolgrowers’ Association
which brought the new Victorian
Farmers’ Union into being) admitted
that at least, numerically speaking, Aus-
tralian farmers were a dwindling race,
the main implication of his submission
to the Government was that the status
of primary industries in the national
economic reckoning be given an
impartial overall examination of income
distribution. Not that anybody seriously
believes that, after the reception to the
report of the Vernon Committee, an
appropriate public plan could easily be
assembled to undertake a survey of that
sort, though obviously it is something
which Government experts should
attempt at this stage, simply to throw
up some guidelines for Government
policy. With or without such an inquiry,
Mr. McAvoy, for the farmers, and Mr.
Court, for mining, will doubtless go on
beating their own drums like all the
other economic interests vying for
bigger shares, or even only trying to
hang on to their present slices of the
national economic cake sometimes
in defiance of structural changes mili-
tating against them.
At the signing of the NFU agree-
ment, Mr. McEwen shrugged off the
declining numerical strength of the
farmers and drew the corollary that
unity is strength. He foreshadowed
that this merger and the likelihood of
its extension to the Federal level would
give an even more powerful voice.
“As your numbers shrink, the stronger
your organisations will have to be: you
are no longer important in numbers,
but you are enormously important in
the economic sense as a result of this
merger,” the Minister said. But
whether or not the voice of primary
industry is becoming stronger, still
begs the main question of deciding on
the basis of economic importance the
place of farming in national priorities;
but as Mr. McEwen and Sir Earle Page
before him discovered long ago, it is
not unheard of for a powerful minority
to wag the tail of the economic dog
in Australia.
AGRISEARCH
FEEDLOT BEEF
THAT OLD MOTHER of invention,
necessity, has added a new dimension
to beef production. It has ushered in
a system of small-scale, opportunist
lot-feeding which can be quite profit-
able. Traditionally, lot-feeding of cattle
was a sure road to bankruptcy in this
country. Some northern New South
Wales cattlemen, however, caught in
the 1965/66 drought, realised that if
•they had had to feed their stock for
survival they may as well go all the
way and feed them for the butchers.
The acute scarcity of quality meat dur-
ing this period put up the price
of fat cattle to record levels while
stores were at a heavy discount. The
margin was wide enough to pay for
complete grain and hay feeding and
yet leave a handsome profit. Some
farmers easily cleared $3O a head
after feeding for eight to ten weeks
in a cheaply constructed feedlot.
Since the drought more and more
beef raisers, especially in N.S.W., are
recognising that a similar opportunity
exists in normal seasons. The difference
between costs and returns is not nearly
so great, of course, but sufficient,
nevertheless, to enable the keen operator
with a good eye for steer flesh to
turn a shrewd dollar. Fat-cattle prices
slump in late autumn to rise to a peak
in mid-spring with the prevailing
pattern of supply and demand. Beasts
fetching, say, 23 cents a lb. dressed
weight in May could be making 28
cents or more in September.
This margin guarantees a good
return on cattle topped off in a feedlot
by complete handfeeding, especially
when a farmer is finishing carry-over
stock. Provided he can buy in stores
at the right price he can also use the
lot system profitably to top off two
batches of cattle for the spring mar-

ket. He would start feeding the first
batch in early June. These cattle would
be ready to catch the rising market in
August. The second batch would go
into the feedlot immediately to be
sold off by early October before the
market began its customary decline.
Fat-cattle prices are seasonal at all
selling centres throughout Australia,
and so the system currently being de-
veloped in N.S.W. should apply in
principle in all the other States.
Conditions underlying the successful
operation of the scheme have been
clearly expounded by Mr. L. D. Beeby,
the Department of Agriculture’s Live-
stock Officer at Gunnedah, N.S.W. His
excellent and comprehensive treatise
on the subject includes typical budgets
for feedlot production with various
rations. Summarising his calculations
on a uniform basis he states that a man
running a feedlot on grain and dry
roughage should Be able to truck off
the cattle after 50 days and make $2.16
a head on them even if the dressed
weight value of the fats has not risen
above their store value. If, however,
the market for fats is one cent a pound
better than store price his net profit
will be $7.20 a head. A two-cent rise
would yield him $12.24 and so on. In
a feedlot supplying a ration of grain
and silage the cattle would take ten
days longer to reach market weight
and would show a profit of $1.30, again
assuming no rise in the value of fats.
Similarly, greenchop (lucerne) feedlots
would hold the cattle for about 70 days
and return $l.BO a head.
Greenchop feeding is the popular
system at the moment, but Mr. Beeby
warns that this method is neither as
profitable nor as trouble-free as many
people think. Producers using green-
chop feeds have generally tended to
underestimate the value of these feeds
and often turned a blind eye to the
fact that they involve much more labor
than grain/hay feeding or even grain/
silage. Moreover, when these feedstuffs
are at a lush stage of growth, their
moisture content, and hence their bulk,
is so great that cattle simply cannot
pack enough into their stomachs to
support rapid growth. Mr. Beeby esti-
mates, for example, that a green oat
crop in winter could consist of 85 per-
cent water, and that a 10001 b. steer
would have to eat 1801 b. of this green-
chop a day to meet his optimum
energy requirements; and this quantity
is quite beyond his capacity.
Part of this diet would have to be
replaced with grain, if the steer is to
maintain a tolerable minimum rate of
body-weight gain of 21b. a day. In
view of the possible need of supple-
mentary grain feeding anyway, Mr.
Beeby feels that eventually grain-only
feedlots will become accepted prac-
tice. They cut labor charges drastically
and lend themselves to cereal farming.
Screenings such 1 as wild oats, husks,
cracked grain, and small kernels could
be saved from the grain-growing side
of the farm and channelled into the
feedlot. This would cut the feed
charges steeply.

AWAITING VITAL NEWS
FROM
BELLAMBI COAL
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE MARKETS • OIL TABLE
COAL IS fighting back. This is the
first year in which iron ore has over-
taken coal as Australia’s major mineral
export and already the coal industry
has announced plans for a massive in-
crease in its export earnings.
For the eleven months to May, 1968.
black coal exports were 9,148,000 tons
worth $77.4 million, a solid rise on the
7,767,000 tons worth $63.4 million for
the corresponding period of 1966-67.
But iron ore exports had moved up
from 4.7 million tons worth $39.6 mil-
lion to 10.88 million tons worth $90.8
million for the eleven months.
But it is expected that coal exports
will grow to $l6B million by 1972-73,
particularly following last week’s
announcement of a $9O million coal
project to export from the Bowen
Basin. Utah, in conjunction with Mit-
subishi Shoji, hopes to negotiate con-
tracts by the end of this year to supply
4 million tons of coal and coke annually
for 15 years from 1971' to Japanese
steel mills. This will probably be fol-
lowed by further contracts, presumably
from groups like D. K. Ludwig’s Clutha
Development, which is working on a
5 million tons a year scheme, that are
expected to lift Queensland’s coal ex-
ports to Japan to at least 11 million
tons a year worth $lOO million by 1972-
73.
Already Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui are
producing from their Kianga-Moura
field at the rate of 4.5 million tons this
year and ORA now has control of the
Blair Athol field. The Bowen Basin
has measured reserves of 1422 million
tons, 2838 million tons estimated, and
5430 million tons inferred.
But there is an aura of uncertainty
about prospects for three other areas
in which Australian companies hold
interests. Last week the Picklands
Mather, Conzinc Riotinto, and Kaiser
Steel consortium relinquished its in-
terest in the Associated oil group’s
Bluff _ deposits. Associated has four
other potential coal areas outlined. Not
much has been heard of BHP’s de-
posits in the Blackwater region.
Very little has been revealed, either,
about the Bellambi Coal Co. Ltd. pros-
pecting rights over an area eight miles
east of Emerald, due west of Rock-
hampton. The fullest statement made
so far by the company was in 1967,
saying, “The preliminary stages of the
company’s exploration program were
concluded. The results obtained, to-
gether with further work now being
carried out, are designed to determine
whether the areas under examination
contain sufficient quantities of high-
quality coking coal at workable depths
to justify undertaking a feasibility study
of the technical and commercial con-
siderations of a new mining project.”
Development of Bellambi leases may
be much further behind some other con-
tenders for export markets, besides being
distant from ports, so its Queensland
prospects should not be an important
factor in Bellambi’s share price. But
in common with other colliers, under
recommendation from leading brokers,
Bellambi’s shares have been strongly
sought after this year. They ran to
a record price of $3, and are currently
standing at $2.70, where the immediate
yield is only 1.9 percent and the pres-
ent earnings yield not that much better.
As Consolidated Goldfields holds
67.25 percent of the capital, the shares
have a scarcity value on the market,
but it is the prospect of enhanced earn-
ings from export contracts already
negotiated from its N.S.W. South Coast
operations up to 1973, and taking all
production up to 1971, that should
excite investors in Bellambi.
Bellambi, because of the physical con-
ditions peculiar to its colliery, has high
costs, but prospective profits in relation
to its small capital (even at down to
$1 a ton) are attractive. Its advantages
lie in its situation only ten miles from
the modern Port Kembla loader, with
reserves believed to be in the region of
50 million tons.
Directors are so confident of the Jap-
anese market that they are opening a
new unworked seam with 35 million
tons of coal reserves.
Japanese steel mills and chemical
companies bought under contract 1.25
million tons of coal from Bellambi in
the three years to March, 1967, and this
was followed by a contract for 3.8 mil-
lion tons over five years to March, 1972.
However, production difficulties made a
bridging contract necessary for the year
to April, 1968, and this 3.8 million tons
was then to be supplied over five years
to April, 1973. This was later agreed
to be a minimum tonnage, and subse-
quently contracts were written for ex-
port of five million tons over five years
to April, 1978.
To fulfil these orders the company
embarked in 1964 on a major develop-
ment program involving an estimated
expenditure of $3.8 million over four
years on extra mining equipment at the
face, extending and refining existing
surface facilities, and sinking a new
ventilation shaft. From 1964 to 1967
inclusive, the company actually spent
just short of $5 million on capital works,
and $619,000 on major overhauls, the
latter being a charge against profits.
The mechanisation which began in
the ’fifties was financed from retained
earnings, a one-for-two issue at 25c
premium in January, 1962, a one-for-
three issue at similar premium in Sep-
tember, 1962, a one-for-two issue at
50c premium in October, 1965, and by
a private placement in 1962 of $500,000
8 percent unsecured notes with life
offices, repayable $40,000 in 1967 and
$460,000 in 1972.
The partial takeover by CGFA in
May, 1964 (when $1.75 cash per share
was offered for half each shareholding),
THE CHARTIST SAYS:
KATHLEEN INVESTMENTS LTD. has cer-
tainly been a rewarding stock for investors since first recommended in December*
1966, when prices were around the $2.52 level. A new
high of $6.79 for the stock was recorded during the current
week and the situation can he reassessed in terms of a
short-term move to about $B.OO with a further target close
to $lO.OO. The past chart history shows that this stock tends
to form interesting consolidation patterns rather than con-
form to a trendline study. Last sale price on 25/6/68,
$6.40.


enhanced Bellambi’s borrowing status
but it did not exploit this advantage. In
1967 a $lOO,OOO secured-term advance
was obtained from the bank, besides
current borrowings of almost $1 million.
Nevertheless, the company has borne
with a serious state of illiquidity in the
past three years. Any company with
lesser connections would have had to
rectify this shortage of funds long ago,
but, even so, it cannot go dn indefinitely,
and a further share issue must be a dis-
tinct possibility unless the company’s
cash flow can show a spectacular rise.
The 1968 results will be released in
a month’s time, and should be an ad-
vance on 1967 profit—as the company
saw it—of $215,000 (only slightly above
1966 result of $211,000). Directors re-
ported that production and sales of the
colliery and the coke works increased
in the December half, and so did profit.
However, recent figures of N.S.W.
South Coast wire production showed
only a 7 percent rise in 1967-68
and Bellambi will need to have done
much better than the average.
Heavy capital expenditure gives
Bellambi great tax relief, so the com-
pany tones down current profits, un-
naturally inflated by negligible current
tax, by providing “deferred income
tax.” The tax is not now payable, so
cash flow benefits. Without this pro-
vision the 1966 result would have been
$307,000 after $43,000 current tax but
before $96,000 deferred tax, rising in
1967 to $342,000 after $12,000 current
tax, but before $137,000 deferred tax,
and excluding $lO,OOO insurance re-
coveries.
The big question mark over Bellambi
has been the prolonged difficulties of
the longwall unit which was withdrawn
from production in May, 1965, for
modification that took more than two
years. The 1968 interim report said
the longw'all unit made a worthwhile
contribution to the output of the
colliery, and its performance was “now
more acceptable,” a qualified assess-
ment if ever there was one, .considering
the high hopes entertained (a possible
250 percent improvement in profit-
ability) when this unit was installed.
British-built, it cost $600,000, and
had to be virtually rebuilt when the
main roof-supporting chocks collapsed
under pressure.
The longwall unit troubles occasioned
the rescheduling of exports to Japan,
and whatever the bridging contract for
the year to April, 1968, required (this
was not divulged to shareholders) pro-
duction was apparently equal to the
task. The company’s words were, “The
increased volume of deliveries required
by the company’s export contract with
Japan was maintained.”
Basic wage increases have put the
squeeze on profit margins in the past,
but the bridging contract was at a
higher price than the original, and
since then there has been a further
price increase to cover the total wage
decision of July, 1967.
Almost all Bellambi’s production is
for export markets, except for that of
the two coke works, Mt. Pleasant and
Federal, which were taken over in 1960
and 1962, and which supply domestic
foundries and non-ferrous smelters.
So there are two vital pieces of news
that Bellambi shareholders will want to
hear in a month’s time. Firstly, that
the longwall mining unit is working
properly so that South Coast profits can
boom the way they were expected to a
few years ago, and secondly, that some-
thing is being done about the com-
pany’s Queensland areas. Without some
reassurance on either score, the shares
could ease back a bit; with it they
would be an interesting buy.
HAMERSLEY
IS IT TOO DEAR?
WHY ARE the British taking things so
quietly in the Australian market these
days? One reason could be that British
brokers are recognising there are
cheaper ways of buying into leading
Australian mining stocks than doing so
directly. For instance, last week Myers
and Co., of London, ended up a long
survey of Hamersley Iron with a
recommendation to acquire an interest
through Kaiser Steel of the U.S. The
reason is that Kaiser Steel sells at about
SU.S. 74, and yet its 36 percent interest
in Hamersley is worth $97 per Kaiser
share, so that everything else it owns
is thrown in free.
The Myers survey says that by the
time Hamersley production reaches 30
million tons a year, probably by 1973,
they expect earnings of 100 cents a
share, or a price-earnings ratio of 15
times at current prices. This is not
cheap, and there would need to be
further growth (which is quite likely)
to justify current prices. But last week’s
“Economist” says that the possibilities
of metallising “are at least worth
gambling on.”
RETAILING
COLES AND DJ's
IS THERE more of a rise left in G. J.
Coles shares? So far this year they
have moved up 26 percent from their
low of $1.09 to $1.38, following last
week’s news of a 13.2 percent profit
lift to $lO million. This is their best
price for two years, and suggests that
the market expects the fruits of Coles’
rapid expansion to begin to blossom
in more profusion than they have over
the last five years, when earning rate
has been stagnant.
There may he some merit in the mar-
ket’s view; last week’s profit rise lifted
earning rate to 17 percent on capital,
the best for 11 years. This was a good
performance, even though Mr. Norman
Coles had a sizable upswing in general
consumer spending throughout Aus-
tralia over the period to help him.
Shareholders are getting all the profit
rise, as the dividend goes up from 11
percent to a transient-looking 11.6 per-
cent (to yield 4.2 percent), which seems
likely to be resolved into at least a 12
percent rate fairly soon. So the com-
pany is ploughing back at little less than
last year into its continued expansion
(which is mainly in supermarkets; it
opened 14 new ones in N.S.W. alone
last year).
It was only four and five years ago
that the shares were fetching as much
as $1.90 on an earning rate, and divi-
dend a little below last week’s. And on
top of official expectations of strong
rises in consumer spending in 1968-69
(partly due to the end of the drought
in southern Australia), the share price
could prove rather sensitive to both the
budget (with its prospects of a $1 rise
in pensions to help the chainstores’
sales) and the wages case in the next
couple of months. The wages case is
probably holding something for the
group in the way of a boost to wage-
earners’ spending power. In addition,
official expectations of mounting indus-
trial activity in the current financial
year could suggest some growth in
overtime payments, which are a major
influence on retail sales. So Coles should
be able to look forward to a useful
growth in turnover (and presumably
profit) in 1968-69.
But taking recent figures compiled by
Australian Industrial Research, Coles
does not appear to be as cheap as
Sydney-based retailer David Jones’, at
any rate on a price-earnings ratio basis,
which the bureau gives as 11.7 for DJ’s
compared with 17.2 for Coles (it would
be a decimal point or two higher than
that now, and so would DJ’s, whose
price has advanced from $1.40 early in
July, when the comparisons were made,
to $1.57 last week). On a price-earnings
basis, DJ’s are obviously the cheapest
of the big retail stores’ share counters,
as its figure is less than half that of
Grace Bros. 25.7 times (at a price of
$3.20 for the shares), only a little more
than half that of 22.7 for Myer
Emporium at the current price of $5.25
(up from $4.22 earlier this year), and
even less than Woolworths’ 14.7 times at
$1.36.
The analysis supports this favorable
price-earnings comparison in DJ’s favor
by suggesting that group earnings will
rise to 26 percent on capital for 1967-
68 from the 23.2 percent earned in the
previous term, supporting this expecta-
tion from the company’s intimation in
February that turnover was advancing
at record levels and that at that stage
in the year net profit was keeping in
step with the increase. It is estimated
from the company’s statements that
group sales will be up by about 6 per-
cent for the year ending July 31, and
that without such a big addition to
wage bills as in the previous year, earn-
ings will out-match this rate of rise, net-
ting an increase of about $500,000 on
last year’s $4.76 million, to provide an
earnings rate of between 26 and 27 per-
cent.

From start to finish, A-Z Zinc is 100% Australian.
It is produced in Australia under the watchful eye

Australian companies. So much so that every year'
Australia uses more zinc per head of population
than any other country. About twice as much, in
fact. And it’s earning Australia around $25,000,000
in export income every year. In countries like the
U.S.A., United Kingdom, Germany, India and

PROBING THE VALUE
OF CGMA'S SHARE IN
GROUP EXPLORATIONS
IN AN INTRIGUING announcement
a short while ago, Consolidated Gold
Mining Areas N.L. announced that it
had placed 50,000 shares with an over-
seas corporation at an issue price of
$3.40 each. What must have caught the
eye of many followers of the stock was
that the shares carried an option to
take up a further 50,000 shares within
a month at an issue price of $4.50.
Certainly the optimism shown by this
has been partially borne out by the
continued strength of the shares per-
haps itself due to a buoyant market,
following share purchases made by those
people who read into the announce-
ment that the company itself is in the
best position to know whether within a
month its shares will be worth more
than $4.50.
The company is quite interesting,
both on its own account and as a lead-
ing member of Group Explorations Pty.
Ltd. A couple of years ago it had inter-
ests in several goldmines around Kal-
goorlie, but they had not been worked
for some years, and the last time that
anything significant occurred (that is,
before Kambalda days) was in 1965,
when its half-owned “Little Nipper”
Gold Mine started to extract extremely
rich gold-bearing ore.
This operation achieved fantastic
results in its so-far brief life, with
grades of over lOOoz. of gold per ton of
ore. At fairly shallow depths between
100 and 150 ft., the average grade of all
ore crushed exceeded 40oz. per ton.
Development work late in 1966 yielded
4oz. of gold per ton from ore avail-
able from shaft-sinking (to a depth of
185 ft.), and adjacent areas were quickly
taken up by the company.
In November last year, the company
reported a fairly severe reversal at this
mine in that although mineralised ore
was revealed by diamond drilling, pay-
able values of gold had disappeared.
By that time, however, it was more
interested in Western Mining’s nickel
finds. In August it had obtained options
over several mining claims and made
application for other claims, totalling
20 in all, covering 12|- square miles
some five to eight miles north-east of
Kambalda. In this venture, the com-
pany retained a 75 percent interest,
with Nickel and Minerals Search N.L.
holding the balance. Later the same
year, further leases and options were
obtained, some on a 50-50 basis with
Nickel and Minerals Search N.L., and
others on its own account in the North-
ern Territory covering possible deposits
of wolfram, molybdenite, and tantalite.
Later the same year, it took up an
option over an area near Roebourne, in
the north of Western Australia, where
cobalt and nickel values described as
“interesting” have been found. In this
area CGMA hold a 37-| percent interest,
as did Nickel and Minerals Search N.L.,
with the remaining 15 percent issued to
the old Ora Banda North Gold Mines
N.L., now 0.8. Nickel N.L. These three
companies took in as partners some
other older, and to date rather luckless,
companies to form Group Exploration
Pty. Ltd. This is the operating company
of the group, but its members share in
different proportions in different min-
eral properties. The basic shareholdings
are:
Consolidated Gold Mining
Areas N.L. 20%
Nickel and Minerals Search
N.L. 20%
0.8. Nickel N.L. 10%
Uranium and Nickel
Exploration N.L. 10%
Uranium Development N.L. 5%
Haoma Gold Mines 5%
Tennant Creek Metals N.L. 10%
Australasian Mining
Corporation N.L. 20%
Group Explorations Pty. Ltd. has now
a fair spread of interests in Western
Australia in the Kalgoorlie area (for
nickel), at' Roebourne (for copper), at
Walwa, in Victoria (for tin), and it has
also acquired options over four copper-
mines approximately 65 miles south of
the Mt. Newman Iron Ore deposit in
the north of the State. Drilling so far
on this deposit has disclosed 880,000
tons of ore, with an estimated grade of
percent copper above 450 ft. One
mine has been proved to contain
160,000 tons of ore averaging between
five and six percent copper.
The nickel areas comprise 9000 acres
at Scotia bordering the areas presently
being drilled by Great Boulder, 6000
acres at Kambalda just to the north of
Western Mining’s lease, two other small
areas just north of Kalgoorlie, and
4800 acres at Lake Barlee, some 160
miles north-east of Southern Cross.
On its own account Consolidated
Gold Mining Areas retains its older
goldmines (particularly the White Hope
mine in the Hampton Plains area), a
total of 60,000 shares in Uranium De-
velopment, and a 50 percent interest in
nickel prospecting leases covering 16
square miles (also in the Hampton
Plains area), as well as 75 percent inter-
est in a 12|-square-mile lease bordered
on the north by areas held by Great
Boulder, on the east by the large BHP
reserve, and on the west by Inter-
national Nickel. This latter area, known
as the “Cutters Luck” prospect, is six
miles north of Kambalda.
It is, of course, the company’s nickel
interests that the market is interested
in and, although these are relatively
small, some of them are in very
interesting locations. It is no doubt for
this reason that current market prices
place a value on the whole group of
some $2O million. The table below may

THE OIL MARKET
MAGELLAN'S SPREAD
FROM OIL exploration in the
Amadeus Basin of the Northern Terri-
tory, Magellan Petroleum Australia has
expanded its activities in the last year
to include minerals exploration in the
Territory, assessment of a potash pros-
pect at Shark Bay, the gearing-up of
survey work in Bass Strait licence areas,
and application for New Zealand off-
shore permits over 11,400 sq. miles.
It is presently engaged in a three-
well drilling program with the object
of discovering more oil and gas in the
Amadeus area to justify building a
6 5-Bth in. diameter pipeline to
Adelaide, and awaits final reports on
Operation Gasbuggy on the feasibility
of nuclear stimulation to increase
recoveries from the estimated reserves
of oil in the Mereenie field.
A $3 million cash raising by a one-
for-six premium issue at 200 percent
premium (just nine months after a
one-for-five at 100 percent premium)
will give Magellan the funds to finance
Magellan and its associates’ budgeted
expenditure of $1.2 million in the Ama-
deus Basin, $300,000 on mineral
exploration in the Northern Territory,
$lOO,OOO to drill the current Ravens-
bourne well in Queensland, $300,000 to
$400,000 for work offshore, Gippsland,
and $300,000 at Shark Bay.
The American parent, small and
unimportant by U.S. standards with
most of its interests in Australia, may
set off against its $1,650,000 liability
to subscribe to 1.1 million shares some
of its other Australian assets, thereby
increasing Magellan Australia’s equity
in the Mereenie oil and gas field, the
Palm Valley gas field and other Ama-
deus areas, and the potash and mineral
areas.
work in Bass Strait has
been of great assistance to Magellan
in assessing its own prospects. Magel-
lan’s areas are in generally deeper
water, and farther offshore (accordingly
more expensive), so Magellan would
be looking for a field of 50 million
barrels for commercial exploitation.
Esso-BHP’s surveys have indicated that
the Latrpbe Delta formation and Lakes
Entrance extend into Magellan’s blocks,
and Magellan thinks the prospects are
mighty attractive.
Magellan has leases over 200,000
acres in 600 ft. of water or less, which
could be drilled by rigs already in use

The

world of
EASTERN
a
Big Future
By Peter Boxal!
Eastern’s Regional Manager
Browsing through an old book on the
history of transport the other night, I
came across a bi-plane.
Couldn't help commenting at the time
how planes have changed.
And Eastern is way ahead. In 1971,
for example, the first of Eastern's Lock-
heed 1011 's will go into service.
The L-1011 will seat up to 300 people
yes 300 in the most superb cabin
luxury imaginable.
There are 8 spacious, individual seats
across the width of the cabin, with 2
aisles for easy access and passenger
convenience.
The L-1011 will have a self-contained
kitchen (a large 13 feet by 15 feet), with
ice-makers, refrigerators and high
speed ovens.
Another new feature of Eastern’s
L-1011 is the inclusion of 6 entry doors.
This means passengers will be able to
board 3 times more quickly than on
today’s jets.
All in all, Eastern is doing more than
just looking to the future. Eastern has
the future all taken care of . . . with
its super fleet of Lockheed 1011 's.
What a way to fly!

in Australia, and 250,000 acres in 600
to 2000 ft. The problems of drilling in
waters down to several thousand feet
have generally been solved. (Most U.S.
blocks are only 5760 acres, hence the
attractions of this huge acreage to an
American company.)
By using relatively new digital com-
puter techniques, seismic data is up-
graded to give a much more precise
picture of the geological formations.
This technical breakthrough has influ-
enced Magellan to engage the services
of a contractor, Western Geophysical,
as soon as it is disengaged from Esso
work. Magellan, therefore, expects to
start seismic work in October-
November.
The basic information on the potash
deposits came from an oil well, Yaringa
No. 1, drilled by Continental Oil in
conjunction with Sun Oil Co. in July,
1966. Magellan will carry the cost of
two holes, the first to go down in
August, to earn its share in the pros-
pect. Continental and Sun have 25 per-
cent interest each, Magellan 31£ per-
cent, and its associates, Transpacific
Petroleum 6J percent and Central
Pacific Mining 12J percent.
By the new year the company should
be in a position to decide on the pro-
ject’s feasibility. It is looking for a
20-million-ton deposit, which if mined
at the rate of one million tons annually
would give a two- to three-year pay-
back. Magellan, its associated com-
panies and partners could be up for
an investment of $5O to $6O million,
and is thinking in terms of setting up a
separate corporation, financing like the
iron-ore companies. If the deposits are
successfully proved, it would be two or
three years after the exploration phase
before the company went into solution-
mining techniques.
Japan is the expanding market for
potash, and is presently supplied by
producers in Saskatchewan and Louisi-
ana. Shark Bay on the coast would
have a freight advantage over these of
at least $lO a ton, and is a little closer
to the whole market.
Magellan intends to systematically
prospect for minerals in the pre-
Cambrian area north of Alice Springs,
which resembles the Kalgoorlie mineral
areas, within Magellan’s 5500-square-
mile area. New technology should
accelerate the assessment of this and the
smaller areas, Pine Creek (894 square
miles) and the Box Hole Bore (175
square miles).
GOLD
THE QUESTION, WHEN?
DURING THE LAST four months,
gold to the value of $U.5.200 million
has been piling up in the Pretoria
vaults of the South African Reserve
Bank. The world’s major producer,
despite manoeuvres by leading central
banks under the direction of the U.S.,
has chosen to hang on to most of its
newly mined gold rather than dump
it on to the heavily loaded free mar-
ket. South Africa’s fear and the
U.S. hope has been that large fresh
supplies at this stage of the game could
depress the free market price.
South Africa’s problem is that it
clearly cannot afford to go on stock-
piling its main export commodity in-
definitely. Equally clearly, new mining
techniques are only partly offsetting
the dwindling profitability of a com-
modity whose price was fixed a gener-
ation ago when in January, 1934,
President Roosevelt dramatically but
quite arbitrarily upped it from
$U.5.20.50 to $U.5.35 an ounce. Pro-
duction from the old Witwatersrand
mines has steadily declined since 1941
and it is very fast approaching vanish-
ing point. South African gold output
since the war has increased dramatically
only from the rich, new mines of the
western Transvaal and the Orange Free
State. Now production even from these
is expected to peak out, and then go
into a fairly rapid decline from about
1970 if the gold price remains
fixed at $U.5.35. What chances are
there for the future profitability of
gold mining?
At the time that President Roosevelt
raised the price of gold, the U.S. Treas-
ury linked gold and the dollar as the
fixed points of the international mone-
tary system. As the foremost opponents
of the sacrosanct $35 price, the Ameri-
cans are partly motivated by prestige.
But a rise in the price would con-
siderably increase international liquid-
ity. Since the war, the total of gold in
international monetary reserves has
dropped from over 80 percent to just
over 50 percent, with a considerable
growth in the proportion consisting of
dollars and sterling. On the common
assumption that the monetary gold
price would probably be doubled if it
is raised at all, world reserves would
automatically rise by about 50 percent
and the gold component would shoot
up to around 68 percent of the new
total. But, in fact, it could rise even
more than that on the massive dishoard-
ing that a rise in the monetary gold
price would provoke. Unless the auth-
orities were prepared to see a market
price substantially below a new SU.S.7O
monetary price (and this is just as
destabilising as a price far above the
monetary price), central banks would
have to take in most of the gold that
hoarders and speculators might scramble
to unload.
The arguments against increasing
international liquidity in this way come
from (a) those who say that this would
be the most difficult sort of increase
to neutralise internally (i.e., some
inefficient central banks might allow
their internal money supplies to rise in
a way that would cause internal infla-
tion), and (b) those who say that the
creation of greater liquidity through
this route would be regarded by the
world’s conservatives as a blocking

alternative to a move to a more rational
system of deliberately created inter-
national paper money, which the Inter-
national Monetary Fund hopes to begin
issuing next year in the form of the
new special drawing rights (SDRs).
The more liberal of the supporters
of a rise in the world gold price say
that (a) there is no reason why a
rise in the gold price should not come
in addition to a sensible “paper money”
international liquidity reform; and that
(b) it is a great cliff-hanger whether
the American and other forces striv-
ing to maintain the present monetary
gold price can hold out long enough,
until the IMF can start distributing
paper SDRs and until these gradually
gain acceptance as tender among
nations (and that, meanwhile, any in-
crease in world liquidity would be
better than none).
The more conservative forces bet-
ting on and working for an increase
in the monetary gold price are diffuse
and powerful. President de Gaulle not
only considers gold alone to be “im-
mutable and' impartial.” He is also
the most powerful spokesman of those
who distrust the growing accumulation
of dollars in international reserves as
a dangerously unstable factor; and, be-
sides this uneasiness about America’s
persistent external deficits, he resents
America’s ability to invade European
industry by its ability to run pay-
ments deficits on the dollar’s role as
a reserve currency.
Thus in 1965, when France was still
running very large payments surpluses,
President de Gaulle made a massive
switch into gold by cashing in dollars
at the U.S. Treasury. And now that
France is running into a large exter-
nal deficit, he has chosen to borrow
from the International Monetary Fund
and other central banks rather than
dig more than is absolutely essential
into his precious gold stock; a tactic
that makes sense of his view that the
monetary gold price will eventually be
forced up by events.
Other European central bankers and
finance ministers share President de
Gaulle’s misgivings about America’s
persistent deficits, though they have not
followed his disruptive tactics. The
major central banks have co-operated
to stabilise the monetary gold price.
But they have nevertheless hedged
against a possible rise by accumulating
gold rather than foreign exchange in
their reserves during the 19605; and
again, at present, by their apparent
readiness to resume buying some gold
from South Africa despite American
pressures.
The biggest pressure on the gold
price now comes from private pur-
chasers, mostly hoarders and specu-
lators, but also including, on an increas-
ing scale, industrial users. In the past
18 years, about SU.S. 12,500 million of
gold has been added to private stocks,
compared with about $U.5.5750 mil-
lion that has been added to official

stocks. Hoarders, speculators, and indus-
trial users were buying up gold at a
rate of $U.5.300 million to $U.5.500
million a year in the five years to
1959; around $U.5.700 million a year
in the following five years; and over
SU.S.IOOO million in both 1965 and
1966. Then, in the four months after
sterling’s devaluation last November,
came the biggest stampede of all, when
private buyers stormed in to buy about
$U.5.2750 million more gold. It was
this last big rush that finally broke the
central bankers gold pool and led to the
present division between the monetary
price and the unsupported free market
price.
In the two major free markets of
London and Zurich, the price is now
unsupported. Trading here is in gold
that is bought and sold among hoarders
and industrial users. In London this
trading is conducted, as before, by the
city’s five licensed bullion dealers,
though with two important differences
from the past. The Bank of England
no longer supplies gold to the market
as agent for the South African Reserve
Bank. Nor does it any longer supply
bullion as agent for the central banks’
gold pool.
After the big gold rush, from last
November to March, the private market
is now very heavily loaded. How long
the speculators who bought them will
take to digest those purchases is guess-
work. Short-term speculators have
already started to unload in quantity:
they joined the rush late and do not
have the resources to hold out for long
(especially as they bought new gold
with Euro-dollars borrowed at 7 percent
a year and more).
A far bigger element in the market
are the traditional gold hoarders on
the Indian sub-continent, Latin America,
and much of Europe, especially France.
These traditionally accumulate some of
their capital in gold as a hedge not just
against the international currency sys-
tem as a whole but also against local
uncertainties.
Recently, they have probably been
increasing the proportion of their nest-
eggs in gold; and they have also been
joined by new hoarders. Unlike the
short-term speculators, most hoarders
are not in a hurry to off-load, since
they are interested in safety not
just profit.
Finally, there is the steady growth
in industrial demand. According to
Consolidated Goldfields, the amount of
gold going into industry has risen in
the past decade from about a quarter
of world output to almost half (ex-
cluding Russia’s periodic and unpre-
dictable sales). This company forecasts
that, on a price of $35 an ounce, in-
dustrial use could double by 1973 to
absorb almost the whole of projected
world output then without any
additions to monetary stocks or bullion
hoards. Most industrial demand is still
for jewellery. On top of this there has
come a rapidly growing demand for
gold’s exceptional conductivity and
chemical inertness from the electronics
and space industries.
The big question now is whether
unloading by short-term gold specu-
lators, coupled with possible, limited
sales by South Africa and Russia (to
pay for wheat imports from Canada),
will prove sufficient to supply the de-
mands of hoarders and industrial
users without the gap between the mar-
ket and monetary gold prices opening
too wide. Central banks may be willing
to hold gold and churn it about
among each other at $35 an ounce,
so long as the market premium is not
excessive. But if that premium should
rise substantially the pressures and
temptation to break central banking
ranks may prove very strong. That is
what the hoarders and speculators are
putting their big money on.

HOW MUCH HAS
BUYING MILLERS
TOPPED UP TOOHEYS?
THE PRESENT SHARE market is
very prone to the rumormonger who
puts out a spate of inside stories about
mergers, new company issues, etc., and
with nods and winks rides shares up
and down as if they were on a giant
slippery dip. Rumors are currently
thick and fast, and it is difficult to
avoid them, for they are a fascinating
part of the securities market, even if
most of them are fabricated purely for
the sport of speculation. One such
rumor links Tooheys with a major
British brewery, and this is probably
the background to much of the recent
intense share-market interest in the
stock.
Rumors apart, Tooheys attracts me
as a company with a lot of share-
market potential. True enough, perfor-
mance over recent years has not been
as exciting as could be wished. For
example, take the following compara-
tive statistics for some of the leading
breweries:
Dividends per Stockmarket

Carlton & United 18 70
Castlemaine Perkins 125 226
South Australian 108 188
Swan 86 326
Tooth 30 118
Tooheys . 64
As the figures show, it is easy enough
to appreciate why Castlemaine Perkins,
South Australian Brewing, and Swan
are stockmarket favorites, but the case
for the other brewing stocks, even in-
cluding Tooth, requires greater justi-
fication, particularly as their dividend
yield is very low (in the 2-3 percent
area) and their price/earnings ratio
showing multiples of over 20 tend to
make them overpriced.

increased by an average of 4.7 per-
cent a year over the past five years,
and consumption per head of popu-
lation has moved from 22.5 gallons a
year to 24.9 gallons a year over the
same period. However, if we relate
consumption to the adults in the 21-65
age group (ignoring that the under-
21s and the over-65s also imbibe),
adult consumption would show a rise
from 43.1 gallons a year to 48.4 gallons
a year over the past five years, proving
that beer is still increasing in popu-
larity. Despite a phenomenal growth
in demand for table wines, total wine
consumption is still only a little over
three gallons per head of adults in the
21-65 age bracket, and, with other hard
liquors showing no real gain, the Aus-
tralian public taste is still more than
ever switched on to beer as the
alcoholic staple drink.
Ranking third in beer output in Aus-
tralia (after Carlton & United and
Tooth), Tooheys failed during the 1950 s
to keep up an adequate hotel-building
and modernisation program, and this
tended to depress company earnings
coupled with production inefficiencies
in their Standard brewery, located near
Railway Square, Sydney. The setting-up
of a second brewery at Auburn
(Sydney) in 1956 and the acquisition
of the Grafton (N.S.W.) brewery in
1961 increased production capacity,
and during the mid-1960s Tooheys set
out on a vast hotel redevelopment plan,
which has involved the rebuilding,
remodelling, and/or acquisition of
nearly 30 hotels and hotel/motels in
the chain.
The main problem affecting company
profitability revolved around Tooheys’
small penetration of the Sydney market.
Up to the time of the acquisition of
Millers Brewery in 1967, Tooheys held
about 28 percent of the combined New
South Wales and Canberra market, with
about 51 percent of the sales earned
outside the Sydney metropolitan area.
Yet the Sydney metropolitan area not
only has about 58 percent of the State
population (and consumes about 58
percent of the State beer sales), but its
population growth is more than twice as
great as the rest of the State. Country
sales are less profitable than sales in
Sydney, due to higher transport costs.
Out of a total of just over 600 hotels
in the Sydney metropolitan area,
Tooheys, in their pre-Millers days, had
only about 70 outlets, including man-
aged hotels and independents, whilst
Tooths, with about 75 percent of the
Sydney market in its pocket, dominated
the bulk trade almost completely. The
following statistics illustrate the market
logistics of the New South Wales bulk
beer market as it was in 1967:

from R. W. Miller Holdings, for an
undisclosed cash consideration, gave
Tooheys a third Sydney brewery at
Petersham, access to R. W. Miller’s
chain of 40 hotels and to Millers’
club trade, which added up to about
10-11 percent of the Sydney beer mar-
ket. On a State basis, Tooheys now has
about 34 percent of the market com-
pared to Tooth’s share of about
64 percent and the lone one percent
held by Carlton & United in some
Riverina border towns. The hotel out-
lets now available to the Tooheys
group are all mainly in population-
growth areas, which gives the company
plenty of scope. In addition, Tooheys
has most of the lucrative Canberra
market from its 'chain of managed
hotels and hotel/motels (such as the
hotels Canberra, Civic, Deakin, Kings-
ton, Doonside, Dickson, and the Coach
House Motor Inn, Griffith).
Tooheys now has a chain of about
200 freehold hotels and about 30 lease-
hold hotels, together with ties with
about 100 more. The 2c rise in the
New South Wales wholesale price of
beer in October, 1967, assisted profita-
bility, but the strike of brewery workers
in November, 1967, and the impact of
reduced spending in the country due
to drought-depressed incomes had its
toll. The interim announcement in
March, 1968, indicated an improvement
in sales and profitability in the Decem-
ber half year, but implied that this
was not as considerable as it could
have otherwise been, particularly as
the 13 days’ lost production of draught
beer during the strike could not be
compensated for in any way.
However, there are now strong hints
that the company has since made
major improvements in overhead
charges, particularly in reducing the
cost of distribution per unit of sales
and, coupled with the increased pro-
duction and sales from Millers
Brewery, which was acquired just at
the commencement of the 1967/68
financial year, the profit result to June,
1968, should be quite pleasing. Anolher
bull point is the recent purchase of
land by Tooheys at Queanbeyan, ad-
jacent to Canberra, and at Newcastle,
which will immediately be used to
build warehouses, but which is ulti-
mately intended as the site for new
breweries.

I have recently examined the per-
formance of 30 top brewing stocks for
the financial year 1966-67, made up of
ten in Britain, nine in U.S.A., one in
Canadian Breweries, the No. 1 brewer
the Philippines, and seven in Australia.
Tooheys’ profitability, measured in
terms of profit for Ordinary to Share-
holders’ Funds (9.7 percent in 1967),
represented the average or mid-point of
the 30 stocks. The top performer was
Canadian Breweries, the No. 1 brewer
in Canada and the No. 5 brewer in the
U.S.A., which showed a remarkable
return of 19.7 percent. By comparison,
all the leading breweries in Britain,
with the sole exception of Guinness
(whose return was 13.9 percent),
showed a profitability return consider-
ably below that of Tooheys.
Summary: At $1.65, the shares show a
dividend yield of 2.7 percent and a
price/earnings ratio of 22.7. Although
the dividend yield is meagre, my sug-
gestion would be to buy at this price.

THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
The mystery of the
surgical boot in
the Edna-Barry psyche
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Barry Humphries ... he played Envy in a film
“THERE’S A LOT of people who
would prefer the show was on in small
halls sparsely tenanted by themselves,”
said Humphries moving around a
dressing-room full of telegrams and
flesh-pink gladdies. “They resent the
sold-out sign at the box office, and
think it suggests a sold-out sign on the
psyche. But I don’t think I have com-
promised at all.”
It’s now 12 years since Barry
Humphries gave birth to Mrs. Everage
(“Ray Lawler was the midwife”) at
Melbourne’s Union Theatre. Since then,
•both the character and its creator have
dominated Australian humor, as hand
in glove as Punch and Judy.
Although the cult figure is now a star,
Humphries resents any suggestion that
he keep Mrs. Everage, or Sandy Stone,
going merely because of their popu-
larity. “I can still say a great deal
through them. And just because they
are not young characters, don’t think
they are losing their relevance. I’ve met
a lot of 18-year-old Sandy Stones. And
the prim certainties of Edna Everage
can be found in a lot of Monash Uni-
versity students. Some of my more
serious-minded friends suggest that I
should be troubled by the quality of
laughter these characters provoke,” he
said, running his fingers through his
now cropped and blonded hair. “They
don’t think people should be laughing
at me at all, but storming out. Or
throwing things. It worries them that
Mrs. Everage comes to the matinee and
laughs at Mrs. Everage. It doesn’t worry
me. I wish more had come today.”
(The first matinee in Melbourne had
been a little light on, and he finds the
act very hard to work to a small audi-
ence.)
“The other thing people harp on is
the expatriate business. People think I
have come back to Australia to tell
the country what is wrong with it.
And that’s not right. I’m not a satirist
so much as a comic. And in the show
I simply discuss some of my own comic
preoccupations for a few hours in the
hopeful expectation that, by some sort
of magic or mass hysteria, people can
be persuaded to share them. However
briefly.”
Humphries lit a cigarette and
attempted to stride round the cramped
dressing-room. “I don’t even pretend
to present a cross-section of Australian
life. Where’s the football fan? And I
certainly don’t have any overall mes-
sage, or axe to grind. Oh, there’s some
concern with the generation gap. And
Mungo McCallum, says I’m concerned
with the semantic gap. (All these
gaps! It’s like sociological dentistry!)
The fact is the message is usually
something perceived rather than trans-
mitted.”
Humphries fears that if he stayed
in Australia he would be expected to
play Mrs. Everage, constantly, whereas
in London he finds more varied work
and has the chance of a decent income.
“I only missed four days’ work last
year. The rest of the time there were
plays for Littlewood, musical comedies,
and so on. I’ve done telly shows with
Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, and a
film with them, too, in which I played
Envy. Which you must admit is a
perfect role for any Australian actor.”
Humphries’ most regular work has
been as Fagin in “Oliver.” He doesn’t
find long runs boring, because the
disciplines improve his professionalism.
“As well, there are ways of keeping
things lively, such as when I had Fagin
ad-lib some reference to the Israeli war.
That innovation, however, was frowned
on by Lionel Bart.”
Stroking Mrs. Everage’s wig,
Humphries tried to define her. “A limp
wrist has always been good for a laugh
in Australia. But Mrs. E’s not a drag
act. And she’s not a panto dame. She’s
a character to be acted like any other.
Yet there is always a minority in the
audience who are deeply disturbed by
a man masquerading as a woman.”
He recalled how Mrs. E. had begun
as a very rudimentary, . almost stick-
figure character. “Now she has come
up the ladder a few pegs, like a lot
of Australians. And on the way she
has become far more elaborately
realised. I get a lot of advice from
people as to how she should dress r
what brooches she should wear. They
mightn’t be able to criticise the show
organically, but they’re very con-
cerned with minutiae of that kind.”
I asked Humphries- about his poli-
tics. In the show he attacks both
Vietnik theology and RSL prejudice,
yet, it was hard to see Humphries sit-
ting smugly in the centre. “Well, I’ve
appeared in some early-vintage Alder-
maston marches. But I’ve got little
patience with the rather imprecisely
espoused liberal causes. I’d like to do
a sketch about a politician, but I don’t
know enough about it. I suppose I’m
apolitic. Anarchic.” Humphries reads
Gertrude Stein, sees few films (“three
a year”), and rarely goes to the
theatre. (“I’m afraid I’ll find some-
one else saying the same thing as me.”)
However, he watches Australian theatre
from a distance and shudders at its
“ ‘Bells are Ringing’ mentality.”
“Australian managements don’t seem
to realise that the local audience is
far better educated than the average
West End audience that they’re
quite well read, and buy a lot of books.
And, poor creatures, all they can do
is read forlornly about overseas plays.”
Humphries enjoys reading favorable
reviews, knowing full well that friends
will hasten to him with the others
(“They reassure me that the person
responsible was a ratbag, embittered,
or English”). But reviews hold less
fears for him than airport interviews.
“There’s nothing worse than arriving
in a city, having flown around the
world, to be greeted by some strange
child who expects you to dredge up
humor from your reluctant and even
dehydrated reservoir.” And he shud-
dered at the memory of some recent
experiences.
I asked him about the future, and
he looked thoughtfully at the ceiling.
“Well, when I was last here in Aus-
tralia I made a few rash announce-


ments. One of them was that I was
anxious to do a musical on the life
and times of Roy Rene. I’ve been
working on this in a desultory fashion
ever since, and I want to forge ahead
with it now. Modesty forbids mention-
ing a very good actor who might play
the part. But I think Graham Kennedy
would make a wonderful job of Stiffy.
“As well, I’ve got a musical well
under way based on my Barry Mc-
Kenzie comic strip which runs in
‘Private Eye.’ I’ve discovered that the
strip has really caught on in England—
a fact that the publishers are rather
reticent to disclose.
“As well, I’ve just completed an
anthology for Sun Books called the
‘Austral Book of Innocent Verse.’
It’s full of naive poetry I’ve been col-
lecting for years, most of which was
privately published in Edwardian times
at the authors’ expense. You know the
sort of things—suede bindings with
wattle and gilt. It’s full of writers like
Elsie Carew, Tillie Aston, and May
Middleton. And I commissioned an
Australian primitive called James
Fardoulys to paint the cover picture.
It is a picture of me surrounded by
flora and fauna, I’m sitting on the
bough of a gum tree looking a little
like Colin Simpson’s daughter. I don’t
think this anthology will trouble people
as much as ‘Bizarre’.”
Humphries’ preoccupation with
grotesque physical handicaps that made
“Bizarre” anthology notorious, is echoed
in an extraordinary piece of prose which
appears in his program. Allegedly an
extract from a novel from the Multiple
Sclerotic Press, it reads in part, “Smiler
is a quadruple amputee of enormous
wit and charm, albeit his speech is
rendered somewhat inflexible by . the
chipped nickel tube which projects
from his ravaged abdomen, and which
serves, with amazing versatility, all the
needs of his abridged body.” As well, a
screen slide of a surgical boot is em-
ployed in the show, and I confessed to a
certain puzzlement about this dimension
of Humphries’ humor.
“That sort of thing has always in-
trigued me. Really, the caprices of
nature do amuse. And I’ve always rather
liked the cathartic effect such things
have on an audience. Incidentally, do
you remember the centre-spread of
‘Bizarre’? It was a generous vista of the
human posterior, and the new Beatles’
girl, Yoko Ono, saw it and immediately
rushed off and made her famous
bottoms film. When I first arrived in
London my long hair impressed John
Lennon. So it’s nice to have influenced
his new friend.”
After his Australian tour, Humphries
would like to rest and write. “It would
be a relief not to have to write anything
funny, and yet I find I can express my
most serious attitude in a comic
medium. Particularly as when you hear
a laugh you know you have got your
point across. The idea of writing
tragedy? Well, unless I actually saw
the hankies going to the eyes, I wouldn’t
know if it was working.”
Communicating
LUNACY UNLIMITED
IN A prime week for political Alf-ery
in N.S.W., the Chief Secretary, Mr.
Willis, said only “hippies and the luna-
tic fringe” would object to his banning
of part of “America Hurrah,” a play
supported by the Elizabethan Trust
(through its contribution of John
Tasker as director), and thus, one pre-
sumes, the Federal Government.
The night we saw the production at
Sydney’s New Theatre, the hippies in
the audience were uncharacteristically
elderly and well-dressed, and the luna-
tics either too subdued or too cunning
to reveal themselves. Also, the New
Theatre has been turning away about
20 people each night because of full
houses, so the strength of the so-called
minority groups in Sydney might be
strong enough to make our politicians
worry about them more energetically
than they’re doing at the moment.
It is 32 years since the New last had
a play banned, and the Chief Secretary
might do well to reflect on the conse-
quences of that occasion. When, in
1936, Clifford Odets’ play “Till the Day
I Die” was banned because of its attack
on Fascism, the New fought back by
giving private performances on Wednes-
day nights, and in a three-year run
eventually played to 30,000 people.
THE HORROR-SHOCK TRADE
CENSORSHIP can be crushingly
powerful, but its influence can’t pene-
trate into every corner of rebellion. As
Sydney’s Cameo theatre has been say-
ing in its advertising this week, “Banned
in book form but not in LOOK form!”
It’s the Cameo’s way of spruiking for
a rerun of the bowdlerised film version
of “Fanny Hill,” a movie that appears
to promise forbidden delights but
delivers about as much studious sex as
“Carry on Doctor.” Anticipation is
usually the best part of the Cameo’s
programs.
Since it ceased to function as a news-
reel theatre two years ago, the little
(216-seat) theatre near Wynyard station
has been catering for the harmlessly
prurient tastes in cinema with what are
known as “sexploitation” movies. Its
advertising has joined the most ingeni-
ously titillating in the trade (droolingly
suggestive adjectives, half-tone semi-
nudity, showers of strategically aimed
exclamation marks), but now that even
Hollywood is putting frank sex into
double beds, the Cameo’s product seems
less stirringly fleshy and much less erotic
than many of the movies in the uptown
family-trade houses.
Errol Heath, who leases the Cameo
and a companion house in Melbourne,
the Star, says the censor is to blame if
his films don’t altogether match his
advertising. The Cameo’s ads and
fascinating front - of - house displays
derive from less puritan countries,
where the films originate, but the naked
breasts and “scenes that will shock you”
presumably disappear from the reels on
their way through the Australian cen-
sor’s viewing room. “We’re not trying to
hoodwink the public,” says Mr. Heath,
“but without an X certificate classi-
fication it’s very difficult to get some
of these films through in the form they
had when the publicity campaigns
were designed.”
Still, the Cameo continues to attract
the eternal optimists predominantly
male and given to slack-jawed concen-
tration when scattered through the
darkness in the theatre and operates
on what is known in the trade as a
“grind policy,” which means continuous
sessions for 13 hours a day. It usually
changes its program weekly, but did
notch a notable three-week season
earlier this year with “Beauties by
Night,” and hopes for comparable runs
with “The Fruit Is Ripe” and “Twilight
Girls” in the coming month.
Sydney film critics occasionally visit
the Cameo for a first-run release. Mr.
Heath would be happier if they didn’t;
they’re inclined to dampen the heat of
the ads.
Students of the Cameo’s heavy
breathing are now eagerly awaiting
critical evaluation of “Africa Sexy,”
which promised “round, full, quivering,
dusky young maidens from the dark
continent, where nothing more need be
worn than a modest smile,” and which
was said to have been filmed in “Native
Color” and “Totalscope.”
TO BATTLE, WITH WORDS
NEW moves in publishing: two Mel-
bourne-based journals, one already in
print and the other planned, are aim-
ing for Australia’s student-intellectual
audience. The first, “Partisan,” is a
political journal published by a group
connected with the Melbourne Univer-
sity ALP club, and in its first issue
declared the need for a new intellectual
radicalism. Strongly anti-totalitarianism
like an earlier magazine of the same
name from the same group, “Partisan”
has adopted as its motto the plea of
Czech philosopher Ludvik Vaculik,
“Engage yourself against scoundrels.”
One of its first objects of attack is
“with-it” student journalism and its
chief exponent, Pete Steedman, the
editor of the second journal.
Steedman, a former editor of two
Melboui'ne student newspapers, is now
ensconsed at the “Age” working on
the proofs of an eight- or 16-page
broadsheet which his employers, David
Syme and Co. Ltd., hope to sell nation-
ally. Market research has been done and
Steedman’s main concern at the mom-
ent is collecting contributors.

THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
WHEN STYLE IS "IT"
The Boy Friend. Sandy Wilson. Phillip
Theatre, Sydney.
THIS PRODUCTION of “The Boy
Friend” is funny, pretty, and endowed
with enough wit and intelligence by
its author-director to deserve the long
run it will undoubtedly enjoy. Its very
wit and intelligence tempt me to a
slightly more analytical approach than
one of general gratitude for a better-
than-average commercial entertainment
What interested me about “The Boy
Friend” was its “stylishness” what
“style” is and where it comes from.
In general, it cannot be said to have
much to do with the actors the
song-and-dance technique that the pro-
duction calls for is outside the experi-
ence of most of the young cast, and
some of them are none too secure about
singing. In tap routines, chorus lines,
and the like, intention must often be
taken as accomplishment. Kathy Read
as Polly, Laurel Veitch as Maisie, and
Deidre Rubenstein as Hortense are
probably the most successful of the
young people at bringing some sort of
assurance and expertise to their roles,
while Susan Swinford makes free with
a good deal of both as Madame Dubon-
net. The costumes and settings, too, do
not really aim at period accuracy, being
executed in the over-colored, exagger-
ated ’twenties style of latter-day imagi-
nation. Ultimately, then, the “stylish-
ness” must come from what Sandy
Wilson has done in putting these ele-
ments together (with the help of a
fairly neutral plot-line and music
score).
For this production he has, first of
all, devised a good deal of basic comic
business, which either belongs to no
specific period or sends up old-
fashioned musical-comedv in general:
exaggerated playing to the audience,
stealing the spotlight (“Poor Little
Pierette”), and Madame Dubonnet’s
singing entrance belong to this cate-
gory. These effects provide most of the
overt humor, but have little to do with
an individual “style.” There are also,
however, effects which owe their
comedy or charm to the reproduction
of genuine ’twenties convention, charac-
ter, or detail: Percival Browne quietly
smoking a cigarette as he paces the
terrace in front of a midnight-blue
cyclorama (unfortunately wrinkled), a
handkerchief tucked in a bangle, a
name like Hotel Negresco all this
does more to set the period and estab-
lish its style than any number of
Charlestons.
Finally, though, there is a moment
when “The Boy Friend” goes beyond
nostalgic retrospective: in some remark-
able, theatrical way the sad reprise of
“I Could be Happy with You” at the
end of Act 2 seems to catch the whole
spirit of the period without using any
obvious external characteristic. More-
over, it is actually sad two-dimen-
sional cardboard cut-out figures are
Kathy Read as Polly with Boy Friend
Doug Kingsman
put together in such a way as to evoke
an emotional response. At this moment
“The Boy Friend” seemed to me to
have style and “style” seems to be
what you’ve got when you’re no longer
representing or imitating something,
but have, in effect, become the thing
itself.
THEATRE/ROBERT WARD
RIOTOUS BAWDRY
Thesmophoriazusae. Aristophanes,
Union Hall, Adelaide.
MARLIS THIERSCH’S production of
Aristophanes’ “Thesmophoriazusae” is
a very ambitious production for the
Adelaide University Dramatic Society,
easily their best for several years, gen-
erally well acted, and is nicely bawdy,
colorful, and rhythmical. It will shortly
be taken to Monash University for the
Australian Universities’ Drama Festival.
Undeterred by Aristophanes’ pria-
pean preoccupations, Mrs. Thiersch has
allowed them to influence the action,
as is right, and be displayed (stuffed
leather, lffin. long), as is authentic.
The translator, whose name is not given
on the program, helps the general riot
along with appropriate modern vul-
garisms, and if the audience does not
really understand Aristophanes’ more
particular classic social or political
allusions, it makes up for its loss by
responding enthusiastically to the
general bawdry.
And this is right and proper. Aristo-
phanes is a very bawdy playwright,
and it is really only of late that we
have been given anything other than
euphemistic versions of his plays, where
all was classically sweet and light and,
in consequence, boring, not to say
pointless. In “Thesmophoriazusae”
Aristophanes’ main satirical targets are
Euripedes and women, with an effemi-
nate poet, Agathon, thrown in for good
measure. The ancient Athenian audi-
ence would have found the play much
more a literary satire than we do,
for Aristophanes continually parodies
scenes and lines from Euripodes’ play.
Women, on the other hand, are satir-
ised in ordinary, standard, and con-
tinuing terms. They water the wine,
indulge in child-swopping, sexual deceit,
lasciviousness, and extravagance.
Even though we are really unable
to see the ultimate point to the satire,
the play, as presented, is both funny
and visually effective. Modern Greek
Bouzouki music is used throughout, and
the chorus dances which are two
lessons well learnt in Australia from
the Athens Drama Company’s 1966
tour. In design, Justin McDonnell’s set
is decorative and lighthearted, com-
bining cartooned columns and temple
shapes with black-and-white images on
back-projection. It displays a definite
sense of comic style, making a worthy
background to the action.
FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
HOLLYWOOD IN RETREAT
The Green Berets. Directors, John
Wayne and Ray Kellogg.
Valley of the Dolls. Director, Mark
Robson.
SEEING these two movies, one might
think that the past 30 years had never
been in the film industry, at any
rate. What of all the technical advances,
the freer use of cinema techniques, the
statement of controversial attitudes and
minority viewpoints? These two revert
unashamedly to the bad old days of
commercial cinema.
After all, why should John Wayne
worry about the emergence of films like
“War Hunt,” “How I Won the War,”
or “The Long Day’s Dying”? He has
become a multi-millionaire by making
the same goodies-and-baddies war movie
again and again in different locales, and
there seems no reason why he should
stop until he or the supply of new
wars gives out. This time he takes us
(by way of Georgia, where the film
was shot) to Vietnam, a war from
which Hollywood has so far shied away.
Predictably, Wayne takes a strongly
hawkish stand. The Americans are all
true-blue, the South Vietnamese brave
and lovable in a simple-minded way;
the Viet Cong are surly, treacherous,
and given to torturing their victims.
The story starts in the States, at a
Press conference given by some
veterans of Vietnam, who are asked
some very curly questions by a cynical
journalist from a horrid Left-wing
paper. The soldiers show no military
inarticulateness, and offer a lot of
arguments in favor of the war not
very good or convincing ones, but
wordy enough to silence the reporter.
The unit goes back to Vietnam, where
they’re joined by the journalist as an
apparently unaccredited war correspon-
dent. He follows them to their remote
and dangerous outpost wearing a smart


beige safari suit and carrying a pale
blue portable typewriter.
Well, I could have told our Left-
winger he didn’t have a chance. In
no time he’s patting Vietnamese chil-
dren on the head, joining in the fight-
ing, and admitting that he now knows
“what it’s all about.”
The film manages to include
practically every war-movie cliche,
even to the pathetic little orphan who
adopts one of the soldiers. There’s a
noisy night attack by the VC, in
which a lot of Good Guys die with a
brave quip on their lips. The VC just
screech and fall over. There’s a
beautiful lady patriot who Sacrifices
Her Body so that the goodies can
kidnap a lecherous and strategically
important enemy general: The Green
Berets drag him from her bed, drug
him and, with a nice sense of decency,
put his trousers on before carting him
off.
In the final shot, Colonel John
Wayne drones to the übiquitous
orphan: “You’re what it’s all about.”
It’s about a good many more compli-
cated things than that, Colonel. In
its false and jingoistic over-simplifica-
tion, this movie is surely an insult to
anyone actually involved in the Viet-
namese war; and since it is stodgily
directed, poorly photographed —at
one point the whole screen goes blue
and remarkably dull, it’s something
of an insult to its audiences, too.
Valley of the Dolls,” though less
offensive, is equally old-world a
return to the good old “woman’s
picture” dedicated to the proposition
that though a girl may be beautiful,
successful, and sought-after, this
doesn’t buy true happiness. It must be
a big help, though.
The movie tries to be terribly up-to-
the-minute by including in its essentially
magazine-story plot a lot of subjects not
mentioned in its counterparts of the
’thirties. It deals with spurious out-
spokenness on sleeping-pill addiction,
illicit love, nude movies, radical mas-
tectomy, and Huntington’s Chorea. But
the familiar nature of the plot can’t be
disguised, especially since Mark Rob-
son’s direction is totally straightforward
and unimaginative.
Admittedly, there’s enough going on
to make the whole thing more entertain-
ing, in a mild way, than “The Green
Berets,” but despite all the apparent
activity there’s a curious lifelessness in
the movie.
Most of the performances, too, are at
best lacklustre. The young ladies who
do most of the suffering Barbara
Parkins, Sharon Tate, and Patty Duke—
are a pretty trio, but never arouse any
great interest in their tribulations. Miss
Parkins, indeed, is so well bred and self-
effacing as to become practically
invisible.
The only times the film comes to life
are in the brief appearances of Susan
Hayward, who has the gusty ebullience
that the whole movie should have dis-
played.
ART/ELWYN LYNN
LOOKING FOR MATES
Kevin Connor, Don Laycock, Ron
Rowe. Bonython Gallery, Sydney.
Kevin Connor. Macquarie Galleries,
Sydney.
Ralph Balson. Gallery A, Sydney.
Peter Rushforth. David Jones’ Gallery,
Sydney.
OF THE TWO SHOWS that Kevin
Connor, an expressive realist of formid-
able talent, has sent back to Australia,
that at the Macquarie is more reassur-
ing, because he has adopted Manet’s
Picnic on the Grass to his own loose,
exuberant style. But the disturbing issue
is whether Manet is to be regarded as
just one of many influences, for at Bony-
thon’s he sees Albuquerque as Nolan’s
tattered brown terrain, New York as
wildly be-ribboned by Kokoschka, and
lonely men in motels and landscapes
ravaged by Baconian angst. Hockney
looks in on the Arizona scene and
Whiteley is the originator of the sketchy,
diaphanous forms afloat in yellow
expanses.
He has no grip on Whiteley’s snaking
calligraphy and balance of the bland
with the agitated, but he now knows
Bacon well enough to use him for his
own interpretations of loneliness; Bacon
cages his figures, places them in flatly
colored, claustrophobic rooms where the
flesh, flayed and clotted signals disinte-
gration of the spirit, but Connor seeks
a more fleeting glimpse of the decayed
and bruised, as in his portraits of Jim,
but his figures don’t look isolated and
alienated enough because they have too
many artistic friends. Yet, as Paul Overy
said recently of Lucian Freud in the
“Listener,” “to paint well in a figurative
element today is virtually impossible,”
and in battling against the most power-
ful mainstream of this century, Connor
naturally looks for mates but, ironically,
it’s his mateship with Manet, a warrior
against the Academy of his day, who
helps Connor most.
The present mainstream of flat-area
abstraction was an underground cur-
rent in 1941-56 when Balson did the
fascinatingly lively works at Gallery A.
A Connor..ravaged by Baconian angst
He was relatively unappreciated be-
cause Sydney was softened with charm
and beguiled by romantic anecdotalism;
and if Cezanne was praised, a natural
development of his planes into flat
squares and oblongs was not approved
even 40 years after his death. In Bal-
son’s day the paintings looked like de-
signs, but, today, when hard-edge
abstractionists aim at works in series
or in modular variations, or make their
paintings part of an encompassing
environment, Balson’s “flat” abstrac-
tions clearly appear as complete objects
in themselves.
Balson had trouble with his aim of
completeness in the early ’forties; the
paintings were too dynamic, too rela-
tional, in that large area forced smaller
ones into submission. Some were too
jazzy, and his attempts to kill color with
neutral gold, silver, and bronze led to
a loss of vitality. So he got rid of
backgrounds, made oblongs and squares
dependent on one another and achieved
variation with a modest repertoire of
optical tricks that made opaque areas
look diaphanous; with such illusions,
he had, by 1950, the surfaces quietly
pulsating as they do in his later dabbled
works. By 1953 (No. 25) oblongs of
pink and orange startle the most effete
pinks and mauves into vitality. He
achieved the happiest combination of
color and form in Australian painting
as soon as he realised that he did not
need the formal structure of Nos. 8
and 9 of 1941 and 1942. He possibly
termed them preconceived, and cer-
tainly George Rickey’s recent book on
Constructivism allows a lot to be em-
braced by that title, but Balson is too
much the intuitive colorist to be called
a constructivist. It’s sheer imaginative
inventiveness and not preconception at
work here.
Don Laycock, who has passed by
hieratic heads of slabs of paint and
through the storms of abstract ex-
pressionism, relies on color as he some-
times magically floats homely plums,
lemons, and bananas in warm, large,
soft-edged areas. Some give off a
Redonesque aura; some banana-penises
are too sweet to be funky and some are
best, like Banana-Plum and Assassina-
tion, when there is a subtle uneasiness
like Plum, when a crimson orb wafts
up from mists of blue and brown. When
Laycock calls a shadowed, golden
curve, Metaphysical Banana, we realise
what the Surrealists would have done
with such a title.
Ron Rowe, with leaden hued ceramics
like early Moore or Paolozzi, balls and
tubular circles, embellished here and
there with a crisp and rather irrelevant
design, is flirting with the Surrealism
that influenced Picasso’s bone-period.
These ceramics are promising and
engaging. Those of Rushforth, who, like
Balson, has followed a single path (in
Rushforth’s case, somewhat parallel to
Bernard Leach’s), reveal him as a
potter of splendid achievement and
conviction. He is not concerned with
the silhouette as significant form or

Stanford Robinson
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
A SPLINTERED EVENING
HOW MUCH OF the Sydney Sym-
phony Orchestra’s extraordinarily quali-
tative range is due to schizophrenic
conductors, imbalance of rehearsal time,
or plain perversity is hard to say, but I
suspect the second contingency to be
closer to the truth if not the full story.
Predictably, the orchestra ran through
its full spectrum from the bumble-
footed to the precise, from the involved
to the detached, in the fourth concert
of the Youth Series at the Sydney Town
Hall.
The D Major Suite of Bach, which
opened the program, was the aural
representation of a pre-Boer War
Forsyte drawing-room before the
tweenies had time to clean up. Over-
crowded, heavy, and untidy, its joyous
healthy lines were smothered in a thick
yet diffused sound which amounted to
sabotage. It is hard to understand why
anybody as musically able and as emi-
nently civilised as Stanford Robinson
could have allowed such a badly pre-
pared piece to go on; the whole thing
sounded like an excursion in order to
discover any mistakes in the parts.
After the performance, the conductor
asked the audience if they could hear
the harpsichord, and there was a siz-
able flurry of hands from all sections of
the auditorium. I suspect this reaction
was due to a desire to reassure Mr.
Robinson or a reluctance to doubt the
evidence of their eyes, as Miss Hutchin-
son was obviously busily employed at
the instrument. From where I was I
detected isolated musical sounds, but by
far the major impact, even on these rare
occasions, was the noise of the jacks
contacting the strings. Where the harpsi-
chord could possibly have made a sig-
nificant contribution in the famous Air,
it was unaccountably tacit, which,
added to some unstylish phrasing, con-
tributed yet another touch of unwel-
come Victoriana.
Redemption was quite a while in
coming, but after being presaged in the
Minuet of the E Flat Mozart Sym-
phony, spoilt to my mind by too much
slacking of tempo in the Trio, it
arrived in full measure in the Finale.
The lack of astringency one would
expect from a symphony without oboes
is never apparent in the E Flat, and the
Finale had a genuine sparkle. Vital and
infectious, the movement bubbled delici-
ously throughout; racing its length
along, it never became breathless or
flustered but was a model of disciplined
ensemble.
After the interval came “Printemps”
of Debussy, not to be confused with
the Printemps movement of the vintage
“Images,” but an early work composed
during his tenure of the Villa Medici
after he had won the Prix de Rome.
This work gets few airings, and the
reasons are fairly obvious. Full of
beautiful sounds as it is, one is always
conscious that Debussy is saying things
which he said much better later. Indeed,
the protagonist element in this per-
formance would have had to be very
much stronger if even the fresh audi-
ence at this concert was to be convinced
that here was a neglected masterpiece.
A first performance in Australia of
a symphony by Prokofiev would also
seem to smack of unwanted neglect,
but here again the first-class reading
which it got failed to make it sound
really convincing. By far the most enter-
taining element was the urbane and
witty introduction by the conductor. A
lot of composers, including Hindemith
and Vaughan Williams, have been reluc-
tant to waste the ideas used in film
music and failed operas; but this Third
Symphony of Prokofiev, the genesis of
which was in his opera “The Flaming
Angel,” hardly seemed to be worth it.
There is so much music of the first
rank to be performed that, at youth
concerts in particular, I feel a judicious
mixture of standard works and contem-
porary pieces, no matter how way-out,
should be the ideal. The Prokofiev did
not seem to look forward or back or
be particularly characteristic of its time,
despite a touch of ’2os experimentation
in the use of glissandi.
I do not wish to give the impression
that this was an evening mis-spent, for
the audience and Stanford Robinson
alone were worth turning out for, and
the flashes of brilliance in the orchestra
were a salutary reminder of the exciting
potential of our players.

ONE GOT IT OUT OF
HIS SYSTEM, THE
OTHER FAILED
By PETER COLEMAN
Australia. Anthony Trollope. Edited by
P. D. Edwards and B. Joyce. Uni-
versity of Queensland Press. $15.00.
Australia. O. H. K. Spate. T. C.
Lothian. $5.80.
ONLY TWO new surveys of Australia
this week. At this measly rate addicts
like me, who keep trying to knock it
off but can’t, may soon find ourselves
facing at least a fortnight without one
new book on Australia although the
reprint of Anthony Trollope’s 100-year-
old work suggests one source of supply
not yet fully worked out.
Both of this week’s are by Englishmen
and written for the British market.
One, Professor Spate’s, is by an aca-
demic geographer who has lived here
17 years and wants to “get it out of his
system”; the other is by a Post Office
surveyor and professional writer 250
words each quarter hour between 5.30
and 8.30 a.m. daily who wanted to
advise British emigrants of the last cen-
tury. (Plenty of opportunities for men
who are not afraid of work and for
women who could cook, but intellectuals
would be better off at Home.) One is
by an ironical liberal who distrusts, or
at least avoids, extreme views, even
relegating one of his strongest views to
a footnote—that our Vietnam commit-
ment is a tragic mistake, — and finds
it “amusing,” for example, that the keys
of “Australia’s own car” are made in
Milwaukee. The other is a jovial High
Church conservative who thinks that the
Aborigine “has to go,” that hard work
with fair wages will do more to civilise
the kanakas than the preaching of
detestable evangelicals, and that St.
Andrew’s (Sydney) is preferable to St.
James’s.
If this difference of temperament sug-
gests that Spate will give us more
facts and Trollope more dogmas, it
isn’t so. Both books are packed with
facts. The difference is that Trollope
is a blustering and often entertaining
earbasher confident that you will be
interested in everything he has done,
whereas Spate is a cautious scholar
who unfortunately tries to conceal what
he himself has done and will not speak
until he has documented his own
opinions with scholarly references. One
gives you, if anything, too much of him-
self, the other not enough.
Trollope was extraordinary. Few
men before, or since, can have seen
so much of Australia. He toured every
colony without the advantages of
railways, visited meatworks, sheep
stations, and sugar plantations, went
down countless mines, crawled through
mud caves, hunted dingoes in Vic-
toria and kangaroos in Queensland,
walked through every city and town
in the colonies, visited opium dens
and parliament houses, churches and
universities, noted the price of meat
everywhere and the cost of servants.
He talked to everyone (except free
selectors whose cause he supported but
whose type he did not fancy) and
meanwhile wrote it all down.
There is, as a result, and despite
his prejudicesj no better book on
late-nineteenth-century Australia, and
it is as pleasant to read as Dilke’s
earlier “Greater Britain” (which for
some reason has not yet been reprin-
ted). This particular edition, as well
as being beautifully produced, is con-
scientiously edited.
Spate, on the other hand, is a Can-
berra man. (He even prints a map
of the hemisphere with Canberra as
the centre of it!) An ANU geog-
rapher, he has carefully collected and
compressed a mass of facts on history,
economics, polity, and society and pre-
Trollope ... entertaining earbasher
sented them in an urbane, easy style.
In this respect it equals its model,
Hancock’s “Australia.” The best sec-
tions are on the Aborigines and the
New Guineans, where he writes with
feeling and expertise, and with the
will to inform and persuade. The
worst are on politics. For example, he
thinks the DLP and Country Party
might become allies; one wonders if
he has ever talked to a DLP or CP
man.
Yet it is a disappointing book, al-
though not for the reason he might
expect. He apologises for being too
impressionistic. The trouble is it is not
impressionistic enough. In the past 17
years, Spate, the geographer, must
have covered a vast amount of Aus-
tralia and talked to at least as many
people as, say, Trollope did, but there
is little evidence of it. He sticks too
much to bookish source-material and
when he goes beyond that to personal
experience he falls into a record num-
ber of “seems”es, “perhaps”es, and
double negatives. It is a terrible thing
if sociologists can bluff even geog-
raphers into concealing their personal
experiences and impressions.
Both these writers were wrong
about their books. Trollope said his
was unreadable. It isn’t. Spate says
he wrote his to get it out of his sys-
tem. He can’t have done that. But at
least now that he has got all the “facts”
out of his system perhaps he will write
another book telling us what he really
thinks about Australia.
LIVING LEGEND
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Dialogues and a Diary. Igor Stravinsky
and Robert Craft. Faber. 63/- stg.
IF MOZART had had a tape-recorder,
if Beethoven could have given his com-
ments on the relative merits of con-
ductor X’s and conductor Y’s recording
of his Ninth Symphony ... on second
thoughts, with his temper, maybe rather
not . . . the mind boggles. Yet here is
Stravinsky, a living legend, a modern
parallel, doing just that. (“Is he still
alive?” people sometimes ask, peering
incredulously at the gnome-like figure.)
The sole survivor among his musical
contemporaries, having even seen many
of the next composer generation buried
before him, Igor, at 84, is still only a
youngster as the Stravinskys go. At the
age of 111 his great-grandfather, “bless
his hormones,” was still keeping lovers’
trysts. In fact, so the composer relates,
he died as the result of an accident
while scaling a garden wall one night,
in true Don Juan tradition, on his way
to a rendezvous.
Today, his most illustrious descend-
ant walks with a stick, is rather deaf
(occupational hazard), and has survived
four cerebral thromboses, which he
claims have made his mind clearer and
younger than ever. To judge by this
book, he seems to be right. And he is
still scaling musical walls himself, at
least, in pursuit of his Muse as “the
lady sometimes takes a lot of nudging
before her wings begin to flap.”
This volume is the fourth in a series
of published tape-recorded conversa-
tions between Stravinsky and his insep-
arable assistant and conductor, Robert
Craft; and it first seems, from a cursory
glance, as if it could be an attempt,
with plenty of additional padding, to
make a little Stravinskyana go a long
way. Apart from the actual dialogues
there are, this time, bits and pieces of
reprinted magazine interviews; some
correspondence although this does
include the release of working letters
on “Oedipus Rex” between the com-
poser and his collaborator, Cocteau,
still in the original French; sacred and
profane bits solicited, Crafty eaves-
dropping, during which Stravinsky’s
smallest word on anything from the
rites of the Russian Orthodox Easter
to the present state of his digestion is
faithfully noted for posterity; and,


finally, Robert Craft’s own touring
travei-diary on life with I.S.
However surprise the result is
entertaining and informative “topping-
up” rather than a scraping from the
bottom of the barrel. Is there any
bottom in a Stravinsky barrel, any-
way? Far from being the hotch-potch
one has feared, it turns out to be just
this juxtaposition of lofty musical,
literary, and philosophical thought, and
plentifully larded earthy asides, that
fuses the whole collection into one
seemingly effortless, homogeneous por-
trait: Igor Stravinsky as a youthful old
man taking off every morning at full
cry for fresh adventures into music,
and new skirmishes with life itself.
Indeed, no normal biography could
give the essence as delightfully or as
accurately. The constant darts from
the sublime to the daily doldrums are
the daily darts of Stravinsky himself.
At the moment he may be selecting
“The Firebird” from among his scores
as the most appropriate for killing the
spider on the wall of his lavatory in
Bogota, at another proclaiming that “of
the perils of old age senile optimism,
fame, therapeutic nihilism fame is
the most, terrible,” and then promptly
being cross when he spots a photo of a
“rival” innocently displayed at his
host’s. He may dine on aphorisms with
Aldous Huxley, Isherwood, Beckett, or
Genet; get tipsy before a Press con-
ference; or suddenly discover how very
Russian he is, despite his American
citizenship, when, after a lifetime of
absence, he returns in the ’sixties for a
tour of his birthplace like an original
prodigal son; or he may register his
joyful astonishment instead of the usual
bad temper and fits of frustration at
for once a good performance of one
of his own works, this auspicious occa-
sion being Ingmar Bergman’s Royal
Opera House production of “The Rake’s
Progress,” in Sweden. And next to his
notes for “The Flood” one may find
the diverting story of the pilot who,
having been turned down by one airline
psychologist as medically unfit for nam-
ing “Rite of Spring” as his favorite
music, finds himself flying its composer
from Rio to Brasilia for another.
His globe-trotting also lands him in
Sydney, which “looks like impetigo”
and is summed up by two entries in the
diary: (1) Brief when Stravinsky
conducted half a concert with the SSO
in the “Victorian cavern with an opu-
lent echo,” and includes a short list of
living celebrities: Australian oysters,
Lady Lloyd-Jones, and Patrick White,
in that order, and (2) Not quite so
brief a visit to the zoo, where the
comments on the kookas appear to
embrace us all “hearty knowing
laughs, and recessive lower mandibles;
they look and sound terribly com-
placent.”
At least Melbourne fares better his-
torically with a letter to the editor of
the London “Observer” about its music
critic, headed “Menzies Hotel,” which
begins: “Peter Heyworth’s ‘Schnabel the
Creator’ quotes a remark by Glazunov
printed in a book of Schnabel’s writing
Stravinsky (r.) with Pierre Boulez
I have not read: ‘Of all the 2000 pupils
I taught at the Conservatory in St.
Petersburg, Stravinsky had the worst
ear.’ I was never Glazunov’s pupil,
never a student in the St. Petersburg
Conservatory, and Glazunov’s only
opportunity to judge my ear was
through my music, a test he failed.”
Being 84 has its advantages. You can
even destroy your own myths.
There is plenty for record fans. The
composer debunks fake composite tap-
ing, slates a prima donna conductor,
von K. (no prize for the correct
answer), and does a bar-by-bar com-
parison of three different big-name discs
of his “Rite of Spring,” none of which
makes the grade. Fun, too, are his
scathing remarks about what he calls
supermarket and factory composers,
who should bring out their scores label-
led “coloring added,” and who prefer
the career of being a composer to com-
posing itself. This career is defined as
lecturing to ladies’ clubs, participating
in symposia, and travelling on fellow-
ships, which may redden some ears even
as far down as our own land. And
even if one gradually gets the impres-
sion that the only good composer (or
conductor) is a dead one with one
notable and obvious exception, well,
whoever said that Stravinsky wasn’t
human, too?
NO NEW PROBLEM
By B. R. DAVIDSON
Famine 1975! William and Paul
Paddock. Weidenfeld and Nicholson.
$5.75.
EVER SINCE Lord Boyd Orr sug-
gested that two-thirds of the earth’s
population was starving in 1950, the
ability of the world to feed its popula-
tion has played a major ..part in eco-
nomic and agricultural literature. Boyd
Orr’s statement was refuted by the
Indian statistician Sukhatme (in 1961),
who pointed out that the proportion of
world population with less than suf-
ficient calories was probably only 10 to
15 percent, and those with insufficient
protein was approximately 30 percent.
In spite of this correction, the Mal-
thusian thesis that the world’s popula-
tion would finally exceed the world’s
ability to feed itself has been accepted
by many people. The Malthusian theory
can only be accepted if it is assumed
that man is unable to develop tech-
nology either to limit the world popu-
lation or to increase food production,
or is unwilling to apply such tech-
nology once it has been developed.
In “Famine—l97s!” William and
Paul Paddock attempt to show that a
large proportion of the world’s popula-
tion will certainly starve in the immedi-
ate future because many countries have
failed to increase food production fast
enough, or to limit population. This
conclusion is reached because the supply
of food per person in underdeveloped
countries as a whole has been declining
since 1963. Prior to this date it had
been rising slowly. The authors consider
that the previous increase was- due to
more land being brought into produc-
tion and that this is now exhausted.
The underdeveloped countries, it is
claimed, are incapable of either limit-
ing population or increasing food pro-
duction fast enough to avert disaster,
and the developed countries will be
unable to produce sufficient surplus
food to stave off the crisis.
The theory suggested by the authors
can only be examined by making a
detailed study of the available data.
The most worrying feature about the
Paddocks’ conclusion is the short period
of decline in food production per head
on which it is based. Similar declines
took place between 1959 and 1960, but
the amount of food available per head
of population reached its highest peak
in 1963 and 1964. The authors appear
to be equally unaware that the supplies
of food available per person in 1967
were 10 percent higher than in 1950.
It is true that much of the increase
in food production in underdeveloped
countries in the last decade has been
obtained by bringing in new land, but
to suggest that this has been exhausted
in a large proportion of the under-
developed countries is incorrect. In
South-East Asia and tropical Africa, the
area of unused but potentially usable
land is large. FAO statistics suggest that
even in densely populated India ten
percent of potentially useful arable land
was not used in 1965.
The authors correctly stress that the
world’s grain supply is the key to world
food supplies, but their conclusions con-
cerning this supply are at variance with
the latest statistics produced by FAO,
which predict that by 1975 a world sur-
plus of between 5 and 21 million tons
of grain will exist if grain prices re-
main at their existing levels.
The difference in the two estimates
made by FAO is caused by different
assumptions concerning the rate of

population growth and the rate of
agricultural development. The FAO
statistics suggest that the under-
developed countries may have a deficit
of 21 million tons of grain by 1975, but
this is only 10 percent of the expected
grain requirements of these countries.
The available evidence suggests that
some underdeveloped countries will
suffer from severe grain shortages by
1975, but the suggestion that the overall
shortage of 21 million tons could not
be supplied by the developed countries
is not borne out by current statistics.
However, even if the Paddocks are
incorrect in their short-term conclusions
of mass starvation occurring in 1975,
the existing situation leaves no room for
complacency. The disappointing feature
of the book is the large space it devotes
to discussing which countries the United
States should deny food to and which it
should supply with food in the face of
ultimate starvation; a policy which is
unlikely to be accepted by any civilised
nation.
Instead one might have expected a
discussion of how the world food short-
age might be overcome. The authors
are well aware of the work of the
Rockefeller Foundation in Mexico and
how that organisation turned Mexico
from a grain-importing to a grain-
exporting nation in less than 20 years,
by introducing new plant varieties, fer-
tiliser, and better farming methods.
These techniques are already being used
in India and other Far Eastern coun-
tries and there is no reason to suppose
that they will not be ultimately success-
ful.
The policy advocated in “Famine—
-1975!” is a policy of despair. When-
ever the problem of world food short-
ages is discussed it should be recognised
that world food shortage is no new
problem. Past famines are far worse
than any that have occurred in the
last two decades. The people in the
underdeveloped countries although in-
adequately fed are better fed than at
any period in the past. The necessary
technology is already available to rid
the world of hunger provided ways are
found of introducing it into under-
developed countries. For the first time
in the history of the world a concerted
effort is being made to solve the world’s
food problem and there is no reason to
suppose that the problem will not be
ultimately solved.
DERMOT-ITIS
By BATMAN
To Be a King. Dermot Morrah.
Hutchinson and Co. Ltd. $4.00.
THIS IS A curious book. It is written
by Dermot Morrah, who goes under the
grand title of “Arundel Herald Extra-
ordinary,” which almost makes him
sound like a special Good Friday edition
of the local newspaper. We are told,
too, that this is a “privileged account
of the early life and education of HRH
the Prince of Wales”; so, in effect, our
Arundel Herald Extraordinary is really
a super Crawfie, a Crawfie with the
blessing of the Palace.
Well, it is interesting to discover all
the agonies, all the problems, all the
efforts in trying to make a young man
with an extraordinary background just
like the boy next door. Yet somehow,
instead of being good PR for Prince
Charles, it always seems to be apologis-
ing for him. We learn of his disastrous
season as captain of the football team
at Cheam. While he was captain the
school never won a match, scoring four
goals as against 82 by their opponents.
We are told that at his studies he
was average in intelligence, that he was
introverted, that he did not make
friends easily. His taste in outdoor life
ran naturally to less gregarious sports,
and although he sailed efficiently
enough he was not drawn to the sea.
His father was disappointed because he
did not inherit his technological bent.
The one science that attracted him was
biology. However, he did like polo, and
he was a better horseman than his
father, but it was unlikely that he would
ever have the same skill at the game.
He was too considerate to the horses.
All the time Prince Charles comes
through as a soft, introspective, gentle
character, a man easily hurt. There is
a chapter titled “The Australian Inter-
lude.” We are told that, seeing Charles
was heir to several crowns, he should
make acquaintance with the peoples
over whom he was destined to reign.
The book never quite explains the
reasons for sending him to Geelong
Grammar’s Timbertop. At the time
I thought it a very odd choice. Timber-
top was 140 miles from Melbourne,
jolly good for riding, hiking, and study-
ing bushlore, but all the pupils were 15,
doing sub-intermediate, and two years
younger than Prince Charles. Why on
earth did they not send hijn to Geelong
Grammar itself, which, at Corio Bay,
was not in the centre of a city, and had
equal opportunities for outdoor activity,
and where he could mix with people his
own age, who were studying at the same
level?
No, Timbertop it had to be, where
Prince Charles was given a supervisory
status. Whatever his status, an arti-
ficial situation had to be created for
him. Boys who had already left school
came back to Timbertop to be his com-
panions. The boys took it by turn.
They were Stuart Macgregor and John
Burnell, and the idea does not appear
to have been a great success, for
Morrah says: “These were the only Aus-
tralian boys of his own age with whom
he had been brought into close contact;
and with neither of them had he estab-
lished any real intimacy. His naturally
introspective character seems to
engender barriers which he himself
recognises and would like to remove,
but which still baffle him as they have
done since early days at Cheam.”
Perhaps there is a very good reason
for this, too. The young man has been
eternally bogged down by officialdom.
I was assigned to cover every public


appearance of Prince Charles in Aus-
tralia, and I even went to meet him
in Fiji. Frankly, what with the type
of Dermot-itis we had already received,
I expected to meet a dull, chinless,
characterless young man. What with
those hand-out royal pictures, he had
always been dreadfully photographed.
But he wasn’t chinless at all. He was
tall, good-looking, and so well turned
out even “Tailor and Cutter” would
have approved. In San Francisco the
newspaper reporters got at him and he
gave a very lively Press conference
indeed. He impressed everybody.
But at no stage in Australia was he
allowed to actually answer questions
from the Press. There was a gathering
at Timbertop where he was allowed to
be photographed; no more. The pro-
tection was complete. It was as if his
guardian and friend Squadron-Leader
Checketts was terrified that the Prince
of Wales would make a fool of himself,
when one always had the feeling that if
Princes Charles with Stuart Macgregor,
S.-Ldr. Checketts following closely
only they had given him a break he
would have won over Australia and
done some good for a royal family
that can badly use some good PR.
Yes, if you want a one-line opinion,
“To Be a King” is not much better
than the old stuff of Crawfie.
THE HEAD
(after Seferis)
The head turned into marble as I
looked at it,
The eyelids where my fingers rested,
The faintly smiling mouth
Head of a woman, haunting us,
Or the skull face of the moon itself
Pursued but never found in endless
drunkenness
The bones of my hands are broken;
I must go to another place.

RABBIT JUST LIKE
MOTHER USED
TO COOK IT
DURING THE WAR in England
when food was short, and eating out
in a restaurant became a special event
because it made the food coupons
stretch just that bit further, there was
a firm belief among the population
that more often than not when one
ordered chicken one w’as in fact pre-
sented with rabbit.
Indeed, it was not at all unusual to
see a satisfied customer sit with fork
in hand trying to establish from the
remaining bones which of the dinner
guests had won the bet.
It is difficult to tell the difference
once the rabbit has been prepared
and any good chicken recipe can
really be adapted for use with rabbit.
But if, like me, you like the slightly
more gamy flavor of rabbit, then
don’t set about disguising its taste, but
make the most of its natural flavor.
Rabbit is easily obtainable, very
reasonable and in no way poisoned
by myxomatosis, as commonly believed.
In fact, most rabbits in the shops are
specially bred for the table.
There is, however, one important
shopping point about rabbits which
if you are squeamish like me about
animals should be insisted upon:
demand that the rabbit be cut up.
Don’t bring the animal home whole, or
just skinned, and then struggle to dis-
sect it on the kitchen table. Insist,
by the way, on retaining the liver. The
inclusion of this in almost any dish
to be prepared with rabbit gives it
that additional flavor of game, which
chicken, obviously, doesn’t have.
One rabbit will feed four comfort-
ably, and usually costs around 60 cents
a bargain food these days.
The way I most frequently cook my
rabbit is the way in which my mother
prepared it many years ago as far
as I know it has no identification or
name and is fondly referred to in our
house as “Mother’s rabbit stew.”
The four legs are left whole, and the
back cut into two pieces. These are
rolled in seasoned flour and browned
with a little oil in a frying pan, along
with four or five rashers of bacon. Once
browned they are placed into a large
casserole, together with the liver. I then
fry, until golden, one large Spanish
onion, sliced, and one or two cloves of
garlic, chopped, and add to the cas-
serole. I season the contents of the
casserole with a bayleaf or two, some
rosemary, and a good churn of the
black-pepper mill. Chop up two large
carrots, a stick of celery, and some
thickly sliced potato. I might even add
a few mushrooms, if I have any around.
Everything goes into the casserole, the
potatoes on the top. Add a chicken
stock cube, a quarter of a bottle of red
wine, and enough water to just cover
the contents.
Place into the oven at around
350 deg. and leave for a couple of hours
or more. There is a lot of gravy —but
it’s groovy with french bread!
When living in Spain some years ago,
I discovered, near the bullring in
Malaga, a very good and very cheap
French restaurant. (Nothing like living
in Spain to discover French cooking at
its best!) The name of the restaurant I
have long since forgotten but the
pate and terrine that madame prepared
will be a lifelong memory for me. It
became my habit to visit the restaurant
on a certain day each week, and
madame, expecting me, prepared a new
one every time I called in. It was then
brought to the table in its entirety, and
a glass of wine was downed in the
company of both madame and her hus-
band, he being the waiter of the estab-
lishment. Then the three of us would
cut some fresh bread and dig in, samp-
ling, savoring, none of us saying a word
until the second or third morsel had
reached its destination.
Here, then, is madame’s Terrine de
Lapin.
Cut the flesh from the bones in strips,
season with salt and black pepper, and
place into a bowl and cover with a
liqueur glass of brandy. Leave to marin-
ate for an hour or two.
Meantime, prepare some forcemeat
with 6oz. of dry breadcrumbs, grated
lemon peel, thyme, sage, chopped fat
of pork, salt, black pepper, and a couple
of finely chopped shallots. Bind together
with one egg.
When the rabbit strips have marinated
the required time, pour off the brandy
and add to the forcemeat.
Render the fat from 4 rashers of
bacon; when cool, grease a large
terrine with the fat.
Cut about 6 rashers of streaky bacon
into strips and line the dish with some
of them. Spread a layer of forcemeat.
Top with some more strips of bacon.
Place some rabbit fillets over the top
and again cover with a layer of force-
meat. Continue in this manner until
the rabbit and forcemeat have been used
up, finishing with a layer of forcemeat.
The terrine (which should be earthen-
ware) should now be three-quarters full.
Cover the top with thin slices of fat
bacon, sprinkle with a little powdered
thyme and allspice, and place a couple
of bayleaves on top. Cover dish with
greaseproof paper and tie down, and
place into a shallow baking dish into
which some warm water has been
poured.
Cook in moderate oven for hours.
Remove bayleaves, cool, and serve as
the piece de resistance to a superb din-
ner. (If you want to keep a terrine for
any length of time, then some pure lard
should be prepared, melted, and poured
over the surface as soon as it is com-
pletely cold.)
If you don’t find both of these recipes
absolutely delicious then post the
leftovers to me.


Letters
Ungrateful de Gaulle?
I refer to the article “Off With His
Head” (8., July 20), which seems to
suggest that it is sheer ungratefulness
on the part of General de Gaulle not
to have chosen Mr. Pompidou as Prime
Minister in order to avoid sharing
authority with him. Perhaps the follow-
ing reply written on July 10, 1968, by
the President of the Republic to Mr.
Pompidou’s letter of resignation might
interest your readers:
“My dear friend: Appreciating the
weight of your duties at the head of
the Government during six years and
three months, I believe I should bow
to your request not to be Prime Mini-
ster again. The regret I feel over this
is all the greater since, in the consider-
able work carried out by the State in all
fields while you were in office, your
action has been particularly effective
and never ceased to answer entirely to
what I expected from you and the
members of the Government you lead.
“This was especially true during the
serious crisis which the country went
through last May and June. This be-
sides was the opinion of the French
people in the matter, as they have just
shown in the latest elections. I want
you to know, my dear friend, that
wherever you are I hope to keep up
particularly close relations with you.
Finally, I hope that you will remain
ready to accomplish whatever mission
and assume whatever mandate with
which the nation may one day entrust
you. Believe, my dear Prime Minister,
in my sentiments of faithful and
devoted friendship. Signed: Charles de
Gaulle.”
Chroniclers all over the world, even
among those hostile to France, have
drawn from this letter the conclusion
that General de Gaulle wished Mr.
Pompidou to be his successor and that,
by keeping him away from power
today, he was sparing him the burden
of sharing the unpopularity of the strict
and courageous measures just taken in
France to erase the consequences of the
disorders of last May and June and that
the General was thus preserving Mr.
Pompidou’s future. Great policy or
mere ungratefulness, your readers may
decide.

China's borders
Peter Samuel leaves me breathless
with amazement. I originally (8.,
June 22) asked him to do no more
than substantiate three statements,
two of which he had put forward in
the context of a claim that the
Chinese were seeking to generate the
“domestic propaganda basis” for
future border clashes. They were (i)
that the Chinese had border claims
against “almost all neighboring
countries”; (ii) that a certain map
published in China in the 1950 s
showed Chinese boundaries as “ex-
tending to take in all the mainland
of South-East Asia . . .” (the map
in fact showed claimed Chinese boun-
daries in the 19th century); and (iii)
that “various maps” of a similar
nature existed on which “Chinese
schoolchildren have been brought
up.”
In his reply (8., June 29), Mr.
Samuel did not answer any of these
points. He concentrated instead on
providing evidence that the Chinese
were nevertheless seeking to create
the “domestic propaganda basis” he
had earlier mentioned.
I then criticised (8., July 13) what
seemed to me to be Mr. Samuel’s
overall attitude on the Chinese terri-
torial question. I omitted comment
on his additional “evidence” since
(a) it was not relevant to my earlier
request; and (b) in the absence of his
original three points it had become
embarrassingly thin.
Mr. Samuel has now come back
(8., July 20) claiming (falsely) that
I had earlier “challenged” him to
provide this evidence, and that I am
guilty of “slippery polemics” for fail-
ing to answer it. Please excuse me
for feeling that in the circumstances
the accusation could have been
better directed.

Industries ' classification
Your article “ACMA Changes
Course” (8., July 20) is in error when
it states: “They have called off their
demand for Government condemna-
tion of the Tariff Board and called
off their attempts to stop it publish-
ing its now much-publicised classifica-
tion of industries.”
ACMA submitted to the Cabinet
Sub-Committee a separate document,
“Analysis of Tariff Board Proposals
Concerning Classification of Indus-
tries,” and I doubt, with respect, Sir,
whether, as you claim: “We can now
report the exact wording of the
Chamber’s private submission on the
matter.”

The thicker layer
April Hersey quotes Sir Alan Wester-
man (8., July 13) as suggesting purely
vocational universities. “Observer”
points to the need for effective decision-
making and for a thicker layer of
people at the top of our society to
have had tertiary education. He says
“We have no plans for extending ter-
tiary education more widely so that the
mediocre can enjoy some of its bene-
fits.” The new concept of advanced
education has been developed precisely
to meet the needs outlined.
Advanced education has been con-
ceived specifically to meet the new
circumstances of our society. It will
train men and women to make the
most effective use of available know-
ledge in their professions, not only for
their own benefit but for the benefit of
society as well. It is aimed at over-
coming the great lag between the dis-
covery of new knowledge (the uni-
versity’s function) and its exploitation
for the good of mankind.
We do need a thicker layer of people
at the top of society directing the
working of the extremely complex
machine that is modern society. But
we will not have to dip down to the
mediocre to achieve this, and advanced
education will be as intellectually de-
manding as university studies. The dif-
ference between students in universities
and those in colleges of advanced edu-
cation will not be in intellect but in
motivation, inclination, and character.

First-hand insight
As the National Director of the
Overseas Students’ Service, which
represents some 12,000 Asian students
in Australia as well as nearly 3000
students from other parts of the
world, I would like to comment on
“What do we know about Asia?”
(8., July 20), drawing your readers’
attention to the existence of the Asian
students’ associations and societies
throughout Australia devoted to keep-
ing the general public informed on the
cultural backgrounds and patterns of
living in their own countries. Their
efforts usually take the forms of cul-
tural exhibitions, dances, and talks to
which members of the Australian public
are particularly welcomed.
In that regard, the Overseas
Students’ Service would like to see a
wider two-way traffic in the exchange
of opinions and knowledge between
our students and their Australian
hosts during their stay in Australia.
Hence it is most gratifying to note
the increasing success of Host Family
Schemes established by bodies such
as the International Foundation
Centre in Sydney, whereby Australian
families are encouraged to “adopt”
our students for a period of their
study in Australia. For such families,
the scheme may prove ideal in helping
them to gain a deeper insight into an
Asian country from first hand, besides
the experience of helping a total
stranger to know more about Australia.

“We started by contacting the Department
of Trade, and sent letters outlining our
products to all overseas Trade Commis-
sioners. They replied, gave comments
on their markets. We picked about 12 of
these countries - and we were off.”
Why don’t you make a move into exports?
The market potential and growth prospects
in highly populated countries can be
enormous.
Note: Exporting can increase your
turnover; can lower unit costs of your
product; can iron out seasonal fluctuations;
and can increase profits. Your company
will gain extra marketing knowledge,
and prestige.
The government helps you with:
Payroll tax, travel and promotion costs;
EPIC export insurance cover; Trade
Commissioner Services; promotion
publicity; and Department of Trade and
Industry facilities.
