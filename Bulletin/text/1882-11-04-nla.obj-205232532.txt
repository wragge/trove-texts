A Suggestion for Federationists.
After floods of talk, miles of leading articles,
and constant professions of conviction that Federa-
tion is necessary .for the development of Australian
progress, the colonies have not arrived one jot
nearer union than before the idea was fiist
mooted. And so long as the scheme continues
to be approached from the standpoints hitherto
exclusively occupied, there cannot be the faintest
chance of its realization. The general oonoeption
hasbeen that the two principal colonies, New South
Wales and Victoria, should lead the way, and
set the example. As a matter of fact r.nd common
sense, this is equivalent to trying to introduce
the thick end of the wedge foremost. There
would be infinitely less difficulty in arranging for
the union of any other pair of adjacent colonies.
Between no other two colonies in the group
do so many and such radical differences
exist as between N.S.W. and Victoria. At
the very outset, there is the tremendous stum-
bling block of diametrically opposite fiscal
policies. The popular prejudice in Victoria has
fastened, limpet-like, to Protection ; and, in N.S.
Wales, Freetrade is regarded as a sort of comple-
ment to religion. In each colony a minority exists
which stands out stoutly against the prevailing
theory, but in constitutional changes minorities
do not count for much. It is probable that a two-
thirds majority oonld be secured in the Victorian
Parliament to approve preliminary steps towards
federation with N.S. Wales on a Protective basis,
and doubtless a similar majority could be got in
our own Parliament to open negociations for
Federation with Victoria on a Freetrade basis.
• • •
But neither colony is in the least likely to give
way. Even supposing that by any extraordinary
revolution of opinions a compromise or agreement
on this particular point were arrived at, Federa-
tion would still be unattainable. The rivalry
between the capitals would stand in the way, and
the vanity and self-seeking of politicians in each
Colony would take the alarm. Altered conditions
might bring extinction to some political dodgers,
or at any rate they would view change with
apprehension. There would be, in fact, too many
dsbateable points, too many conflicting interests
to be reconciled or appeased. An unmistakable
danger due to the separate Governments of the
colonies, or a common disability and loss obvi-
ously removable only by amalgamation, may
bring about Federation, But nothing short ot
extraordinary and imminent disaster of that [kind
is likely to overbear the repugnance and jealousies
which already have attained force enough to keep
the two principal colonies apart.
• • •
The actual tendency in Australia is in fact
rather centrifugal than cohesive. The population
of Northern Queensland is, at the present time,
actively organizing a movement for separation
from that colony. The familiar arguments, used
successfully when Queensland and Victoria were
severally detached from New South Wales, are
being employed afresh. The North Queenslanders
quote census and revenue returns to show that
their population and their revenue now are equal
to or greater than those which Queensland
possessed when that colony was granted separa-
tion from New South Wales. They allege also
nogleot and mis-government, partly due to the
preponderance of Southern members, and partly
attributable to irremovable causes —snob as the
distance of the Northern districts from the
seat of Government. This plea of mis-
govarnment is not, indeed, Tb.j strongly sup-
ported by cases in point. As a matter of fact,
there is reason to believe that the increased
facility of rapid and frequent communication by
steamships, and the extensive application of tele-
graphic lines have materially altered conditions
since Queensland demanded to be released from
N.S. Wales. Otherwise, the case of the Northern
Districts seems to be quite on a par with that of
the one the residents quote as a precedent. Never-
theless, there seems little likelihood that separation,
pure and simple, will be conceded. The idea of
Federation is, in the abstract, popular even in the
colonies generally. And, what is more to the
point, the Federation ideal has been definitively
adopted as a fixed article of policy by the Colonial
Office in Gaeat Britain, in which, in reality, the
option of permitting or preventing a territorial
and political separation is vested.
* • •
It would be not a little singular were the first
step towards Australian Federation to proceed
from a movement designed to repeat the separation
process. Yet there seems a possibility that this may
actually come to pass. Given a sufficiently
numerous community, in a geographically suitable
territory, bent upon self-government, and a ruling
power—the Colonial Office—resolutely determined
upon Federation, and constantly on the qui vive
for an opportunity of initiating that system some-
how and somewhere, the chances of a compromise
seem strong. It is almost certain that the
Imperial authorities would not consent to
further slicing off of new colonies on the
old plan which they are now anxious to
repair. But, on the other hand, there
seems every likelihood that the Colonial Office
might, if the case were aptly put before the
officials, lend every countenance and support to a
movement for creating out of the excessive and
unweildy territory of Queensland, two colonies,
distinct, yet united by a Federal Government.
The opportunity for instituting an experiment, and
placing an example before the older colonies would
bo extremely tempting. The reluctance of
Southern Queensland to let the North go would
be materially abated if the conditions were
arranged on a Federative basis. The people of
Northern Queensland would prefer partial self-
government to a continuance of existing con-
ditions ; and did they once recognise that they
must choose between Federated separation and
no separation at all, they would, doubtless,
eagerly strive to seeure the qualified boon, even
if they did not on reflection see reason to prefer it.
A Policy f or the Opposition.
At Warren, on the 20th of last month, Sh
Patrick Jennings, as reported, spoke to the
following effect: —“ The extension of the railways
was intimately connected with the land question ;
for, if these were to pay, hona-fide settlement must
be promoted. Had the law of 1861 produced such
settlement? He thought not. it had tended
rather to the accumulation of great estates. They
wanted homestead areas, upon which the people
could grow in wholesome association, having
within their reach all social, educational, and
religious advantages. This could be realised in
harmony with a policy that would grant good
leases for a term of years to the squatters, while
it was also desirable that the great plains of the
interior should provide for a class of smaller
graziers. In this way, security of tenure would
turn the land to the utmost use, and would
provide equally for the interests of settlement
and for the progress of pastoral industry.
From these considerations, there naturally arose
the necessity of water-supply for the dry interior,
and the best form in which this could be furnished
was under the provisions of a local government
bill. Local institutions were in full operation in
all the other colonies, and it was degrading that
they, the descendants of a free-born race, should
have to run to Sydney for everything they
wanted.”
• • •
These views touch things as they are, and point
to the reforms most urgently needed ; namely, to
a land policy that will provide security and free
scope for every form of enterprise and settlement,
oonpled with that beat of all remedies, local self-
government. Such suggestions involve radical
alterations in our whole system quite beyond any
ideas that would be likely to ooour to a mere par-
tisan of either the squatters or the selectors, and
are plainly not inaooord with those Parliamentary,
legal, and other interests which have thriven on
the confusion and discord generated by the exist-
ing law. They have clearly not been adopted to
conciliate any class or clique, and bear the impress
ot independent thought.
• mm
It is a rare thing to see a man step outside the
narrow limits of class interest and social con-
ventionality to discuss a public question in a broad
spirit. Plain speech and masculine thought are
especially welcome at a time when Ministers are
attempting to gull the country with quack
nostrums, applying sham cures to a disorder that
they are either ignorant of, or fear to expose, while
few leaders of opinion inside the House or out of
it, have as yet ventured to raise their voices. Wo
shall soon see whether the policy shadowed forth
by Sir Patrick is to® big a thing for the
Opposition.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Mr. Garvan’s Charge.
The charge made by Mr. Garwht against the Colonial
Treasurer, last Thursday night, is one of those grave
generalities which, with a show of circumstantiality,
can neither be proved nor disproved. It showed the
infinite tact of the Premier in offering te make it a
Government question if Mr. Qarvan would make a
substantive motion. The Treasurer has held his pre-
sent office for more than three years, and, during_the
whole of that time, he has done comparatively nothing
to make the Circular Quay what its position fits it for
—the chief wharf of Sydney. The peculiarity of ho
situation lies in the fact that Mr. Watson is not only
the Colonial Treasurer but also one of the largest
import merchants in the colony, and, in both capacities,
he is virtual owner of a great amount of wharfage
Accommodation. It is, no doubt, a strange difficulty to
know how to deal with each property so as not to
depreciate the other. But Mr. Watson has himself to
*hank alone for the grave suspicion which has been
formulated by the member for Eden. For these three
years past, during which Mr. Watson has held office,
■xcept for the building of the jetties to accommodate
he harbour passenger traffic, nothing has been done to
enhance the value of this great Government property
yVhat if the Government, in its capacity of whaxfowner,
omes into competition with the business men of the
dty P Is the Government to take up only the unremu-
iterative lines ? And, having a property which, with
judicious management, might be mads profitable, is it
to be expected that that property shall lie idle rather
tl an be made to lessen the merchants' profits ? If the
Government does not core to manage the Circular Quay
itself then the Treasurer’s present action is so good
that the inquiry comes quite naturally, why was it not
done before ? The Treasurer’s department is an Augean
stable, and needs a clean sweep out. What with quaran
tine exposures, storage of explosives, and the manage-
ment cf the Circular red-tape seems to prevail in
the Treasury.

Mr. William Forester.
By the death of Mr. William Forster the colony
loses an able man and the Parliament an honest one. It
is of course only a coincidence, but it is a striking fact,
that on the day of Mr. Forster’s death a large meet-
ing should bo hold to devise means for commemorating
a great man, a scholar, an author, a Parliamentarian,
an honest and able man all round. It would be almost
absurd to say that Mr. Forster will be most regretted
in the Assembly; it is the country which will most miss
and most regret him. For now, that aou'e mind and
lean tongue are removed, there will be ore commanding
man the leas to stand between “ strong Governments ”
and spoliation and exploitation of the psople. The
Herald tells us he was not a successful politician.
That depends upon what success is thought to be. It
to be a master of political intrigue, a head of 11 strong
Governments,” a leader of a large party, a Minister of
many offices, is to bs a successful politician, then
decidedly Mr, Forster was not one. Neither was he
he author of an invaluable Education Act, under which
subjects are taught which there are no men in the
service competent to teach, nor of a Licensing Act,
which has made our distant suburbs scenes of Baccha-
nalian and erotic revelry. Let up, then, gratefully
remember that Mr. Forster was not a “ successful
politician.” Two of those at one time would be the
ruin of us. But that Mr. Forster was anlhonest man
will be his greatest commendation to the people of this
country. His bauds were clean from compensation-
swindles, from rail way-land-jobbvry. from Mining Act
swindles. The famous speech of Mr. Forster before
the Colonial Institute in London excited in certain
quarters in this colony the strongest disapproval. It
is somewhat singular that what Mr. Forster applied
to the politicians of Australia, and for which he was
taken so magnificently to task by the politicians of this
colony, was exceeded in severity and generality by an
utterance of Dr. Badham in a recent contribution to
the Sydney University Magazine.

One night, last session, Brother Woseby spoke
on the Protection of Animals Bill, and patheti-
cally remarked that “ Woofliss wuffima ware going
about wooflessly destroving little wobins.” The House
laughed, but Brother Woseby couldn’t see where the
joke came in.
Mr. Abigail is one ot the funniest man in the
colony, because he’s the densest. Speaking against
the C. O. proposal, the other night, in the Assembly,
he said : " There was a similar act to this passed in
Auckland in 1863. People did not know it at the time ;
they thought it meant a disease in sheep.” Just so,
innocent Abigail! Black sheep I
Mr. Eyrie has given notice of motion for the
printing of the papers in the I) ty, jun., case. At the
same time Mr. Levien, one of Mr. George Day's bosom
friends, gave notice of motion for the production of
papers which, it would seem, are called for with a view
©f trying to prove that Mr. Bvria also has dabbled in
the dummying business. Howeva-, two blacks don’t

On Wednesday evening, when the House was in
Committee, Mr. Qarvan wished to refer to a previous
discussion iu the Assembly relating to the charges
made against the Treasurer, but Mr. Cameron immedi-
ately silenced him by saying that ha could not refer to
a previous debate in the House. The next speaker was
Sir Henry Parkos, and he was allowed to refer to what
had taken place. The Chairman of Committees has ot
late been astounding even those who believe in him.
An unsuccessful candidate at a late election,
accused, at the declaration of the poll, a certain in-
dividual ot getting up a religious cry, and of splitting
np the votes by bringing out a third candidate. The
individual so named promptly called the beaten grum-
bler a " liar.” Things looked healthy for a mill, but the
gamenesa of the p irties somehow or other died out. So.
to console the so-called •* liar,” a few leading residents
gave him a dinner and the usual course of baok-saratoh-
ing. That’s how we run politics out hero.
C.M G. Davies is a wonderful whipper-in
of the pliant supporters of the Government
Tho other evening the division on the second
reading of the Forests Bill was taken, and as
the bells were ringing, a prominent Oppositionist
was heard to declare that the vote would for a certainty
be against the Government. But Mr. Stuart and his
party were woefully disappointed, as John Davies had
an unexpected army of the faithful followers of the
bungling and misruling Government to march in.
Over thirty members went through the scandalous
form of voting for a bill which they were told in the
plainest English would not be heard of again.
Tho stormy petrel is so exceedingly oily in
texture, that the inhabitants of the Faroe Islands draw
a wick through its body and use it as a lamp. Now, we
have a politician whose •* Muddy Vesture of Decay” is
so superabundantly saturated with oily gammon, that
't would be a good plan to pass a monster wick through
his corpus, igniting it at both ends When this was
accomplished, one extremity should be placed in the
“Ouse” and the other iu the Council Chambers.
Perhaps, in some mysterious way, this might be the
means ot throwing a light on the mysterious doings iu
those two places. Anyhow, the experiment is worth
the wick.
Mr. Francis has been quietly shelved from the
leadership of tho Victorian Conservative party which
has been bolstering np tho O’Loghlen Government, and
Mr, Gillies has been installed iu his place. Mr. Francis
was not consulted about this change, so that there is a
serious split in the ranks of those who delight to dub
themselves “ Constitutionalists.” Times change fun-
nily. O’Loghlea was the reddest of red-rag Berryites j
now he is a “place, progress, and prosperity” leader.
Gillies, Fraser, and Shtel were the most virulent de-
nunciators of the “ Berry blight; '* now they coquetting
to form a Berry coalition to npset the “ p. p. and p.”
party. The Parkas and twins won’t be a
circumstance to Gillies and Berry, should they ever be
leashed together.
The Queensland Government has saved over a
million by the healthy competition between the rival
syndicates for the construction of the Warrego railway
on the land-grant system. The Lukin Syndicate com-
menced at Charleville; asked 12,000 acres per mile;
required ten years’ exemption from rates; stipulated,
indirectly, that if the line did not pay, the Government
should work it j prohibited the sale of all Crown lands
within sixteen miles of the line for fifteen years; and
agreed to sell the railway to the colony at actual costs.
The Australasian Syndicate commence thirty miles east
of Charleville, take almost valueless land inpayment;
ask 2000 acres less per mile; require no exemption from
taxes ; work the lino themselves, loss or no less; do not
wish the adjacent Crown lands looked up; and bargain
to sell tho railway during tho first six years at half
cost. At least, this is what tho AuntnUian syndicate
say.
This is the very latest joke of Sir Jocular John.
During a recent debate ho otf-handedly observed: “I
have been informed that nearly 30,000 acres of land are
adyertised for sale by auction in the course of Novem-
ber, at Mores, but I consider this area to bo excessive
for one place in one day, and it shall be reduced."
Now, here’s where the laugh comes in. The Minister
for Lands should have needed no gbost, come from the
grave, to “inform” him of this, for tho stark-naked
truth is, the sale advertisement has for some time ap-
peared in that humorous journal called the Govern-
ment Gazette, and it bears the signature of “ John
Robertson, Minister for Lauds ” One of two things
sticks out just at this point with all the undesirable
prominence of a new wart on a bridegroom’s nose;
either that signature was unauthorised, or the Father
of our Land Laws deems such a paltry area ot some of
our best country as 30,000 acres beneath consideration,
and he consequently signed the ad. in question without
taking the trouble to read it. These are the horns of
the dilemma, and Rip can hook himself on to whichever
one he chooses.
The present S. Australian Government are
getting “hot coffee” about alleged extensive land
jobbery. It appears they permitted the whole of the
unsold lands in the originally-surveyed area of the
Northern Territory, or about 200,000 acres in all, to be
swooped np by Adelaide “ rings” at 7s. 63. per acre, and
then raised tbe price of other lards unsold to 12s 6d.
per acre, besides withdrawing from the operation of
any Land Act “ all other lands in the Territory.” Two
years ago 80,000 acres of land were given away to
eighteen members of Parliament and others, on con-
dition that 10s. per acre should be expended on im-
provements, when tbe Crown grants should issue.
Small settlers were shut out. and the land-sharks waxed
fat It is rather late in the day now for the local papers
to slate the 8. A. Government. It might be more to the
purpose to ponder over the recent Ministerial trip to the
Northern Territory, and watch the course of the tin and
other mineral rackets. Pi rhaps, it’s rather too late for
them also.
Mr. Gar van last week roundly charged Mr.
Watson, the Colonial Treasurer, with having caused a
“robbery of public money in order to play into the
hands of private wharf-owners," by maintaining full
rates at the Circular Quay, which is Government pro-
perty, and by allowing rebates amounting to 30 or 40
per cent, to private wharf-owsers. Mr. Qarvan.also
pointed out that Mr. Watson was “the owner ot one
of the finest private wharves in the city, at which ho
gave a rebate of four or five times ten per cent.” The
sentiments of the S.M. Herald are in striking contrast
to those of Mr. Garvan. The Herald says : “ There is
nothing in the fact that Mr. Watson is Colonial
Treasurer, and so manager of the Circular Quay, to
interfere with his conducting his own private wharfage
business in the way that may best serve his private
interests, whether by allowing rebates, or by other
lawful means ” Extend this principle, and perhaps
Mr. Watson could close tho Circular Quay altogether ?
Or apply it to other branches of trade, and how
couldn’t we splash over the revenue backet ?
The Smith family is in the descendant. The
Victorian Parliament used to contain half-a-dozen or
more (Smiths—G. f. Smith, tho most sarcastic man
and one of tfie ablest lawjers and journalists of his
time; Murray Smith, the Oxford graduate, whoso
speeches were remarkable for beauty of language and
depth of thought ; Major Smith —an ignorant, big-
footed man, but a wonderful tactician; “Dr.” L. L.
Smith, tho man of physio, champagne, and the turf;
and poor old John Thomas—the man who imported the
first donkey into the (colony. Of this quintette, two
only remain in Parliament—the Major and the Dr. —
and their disappearance from politics would not bo
regarded as a national calamity. Now, we turn to our
own Parliament, and see how it stands in regard to
Smiths. First of all (of course), there is Burdett the
Beautiful. Well, we will part with him willingly it the
Victorians will take him off our hands. He is mors
ornamental that useful. Then there is Mr. T. E. Smith,
whose ambition has never risen beyond a desire to
know whether, the Government would cause three
grains of sand to be removed off a road at Penrith. And
—spirit ot the mighty cynic hide your diminished head!
—there is Mr. Sydney Smith, who is perpetually talking
about the mismanagement ot the railway department, In
regard to “that there wood business." This fact, and
his style generally, suggest the thought that it is pos-
sible that his head was fashioned out of a block of
wood. This is our array of Smiths, and who will say
that we have not reason to be proud of them ?
The Treasurer was in tho wars last week. On
Tuesday night, he had to answer as best he could a
long indictment of mal administration in connection |
witu the quarantine business It was fortunate for Mr.
Watson tout the charges related to long past events;
bad the abominable atrocities at the quarantine station ’
been revealed before the close of last session, as they
ought to have been, there would, undoubtedly, have
been an outburst of popular indignation, which would
have been appeased only by the removal or by the
political lynching of the chief bungler. Id seems that
the Eoyal Commission had taken the bulk of the evi-
denoe long before the close of the last session, but they
could not draw up their report until they had visited
the quarantine station, and by a very convenient
arrangement they were precluded from doing this by the
presence of patients at the station unfit a few days after
Parliament had prorogued The business of the Com-
mission was skilfully managed all through, so as to 1
shield the Government. On the following evening Mr.
Garvan asserted ia plain English, that Mr. Watson had
managed the wharfage business to the prejudice of the
Government whsrves and to the benefit of private wharf
owners. Of course, Mr. Watson “ hur-r-r-lel ’’ back
tho charge with contempt, and Sir Henry came to the
rescue ot his colleague, by asking Mr. Garvan to move
for the appointment of a select committee to investigate
the charge Mr. Garvan did not accept the offer.
Under the Parkes regime, no matter whit may be proved
before a Commission, the “noses" invariably say it’s
all right. The blood of those who perished at the
quarantine charnel-house —who, during their dying
agonies were allowed to wallow in filth, and be
“ attended ” by a set of drunken scoundrels—is on the
heads of the officials. Bug “it's ail right." Me.
Garvan should either withdraw his charges or prove
them.
The Queensland Anti-Coolie League have issued
a very business-like manifesto, pointing out that should
Coolies once be brought to tne colony, they would
completely drive out tne white labouring population,
at in the Mauritius and South Africa ; that there is in
India a surplus population of 60,000,000 Coolies, com-
prising mechanics as well as labourers, and that thou-
sands of these would bo shipped to Queensland
monthly; that Coolies could fill every position occu-
pied by the white working (Basses here, and would
work for wages upon which a European oonld not
exist; that the rates of wages paid to Coolie mechanics
monthly are as follows :—Carpenters 18s., masons 12 j.,
labourers 125., horse-drivert 10s., and all other trades
in proportion ; that, as Coolies’ food consists of 2tb.
rice per day, mixed with a little curry, they can live on
Is. 6d. per week by importing their food or growing it
in the colony ; that Coolies would be entitled to a v*,te
after six months* residence, and the planters and large
employers of Ccolie labour would then be able to out-
vote the white population, and have tbe making of
laws entirely in tfieir own hands.” Xhe motto of the
Anti-Coolie League is:—“Queensland for the White
Man 1 Believing that its soil and climate have speci-
ally adapted it as the homo of the European races,
wo emphatically protest against the introduction
of Coolie or Asiatic labour into this colony, being
sal isfled that such labour is not essential to its pros-
perity, but is antagonistic to the welfare of its indu*.
trial population. ... We are leagued together for
the repeal of the Coolie Act, and will not rest satisfied
until it is removed from the Statute Book
Believing that the demand of the labour market in
this colony can be supplied from the United Kingdom
and the continent ot Europe, we will oppose by every
constitutional means the Introduction ot Coolies here;
failing that, we will take such other steps as may be
necessary to prevent that end.”
Now that there is a prospect of some serious
work for an Opposition, and a chance of success if
proper discipline be observed, perhaps it will be well to
dr«p a hint to the rather too easy-going leader.
First of all, the capacious mouth of Mr. Pigott must be
*' bunged,” or his tongue “ snipped," because a speech
of ten minutes from him is enough to damage any cause.
A man who undertakes to censure other men for want of
independence onght to be one against whom such a
.charge could not be made. But Mr. Pigott does not
occupy this desirable position—hence his sneering
remarks applied to members “over the way" are dis-
agreeable only because of the extraordinary tone of
voiee and the gesture by which they are accompanied.
Tho "ticket" which secured Mr. Pigott’s return was
tnat it was supposed he wonld be able to induce
Government to agree to the construction of a railway
from Eedfern to Circular Quay. While he was iu tbe
very “green" stage, and tho Government used to per-
sistently assert that the matter “ would receive imme-
diate consideration,” he suppoited thorn on any and
every question, but directly they were driven into a
corner, and had to confess that they did not approve of
the project, he abandoned them. His doing so was
perfectly natural, but if he were not still in the chrysa-
litic state, ho wonld allow railway matters to pass
without comment. He is essentially a local “ railway
man," and therefore is not the right individual to
castigate the “ bridge-agin-yonr.own-door men.” H©
belongs to the order of the over-conceited, and as
such is hard to control, but Mr. Stuart ought to
take him in hand and instruct him how to act.
Another oppositionist, whose wings require to be
trimmed a little, is Mr. J, P. Abbott Ho is too
recent a deserter from the Government —whom he has
helped to extricate from the mire on many an occasion,
—and the mud through which they have had to be
dragged has been of the “ gluey ” order, very sticky—
to justify his assuming a prominent position in Opposi-
tion at present. Mr. K. B. Smith ought to be snubbed
right out. His support depends upon fulsome flattery
of his personal appearance and his colossal intellectual
attainments; and when serious work is in hand, false
adulation must be avoided. The Government would
prefer Mr. Smith to remain in Opposition. Mr.
M’Elhone, Nick himself could not control ; so the
Opposition has nothing for it but to submit to his
vagaries.
The “ representative” Legislative Council in
Western Australia has only the power of recommending
measures, subject to JDowning-straet approval. The
Governor is a virtual autocrat, and acts as he pleases
on his own responsibility, even to the extent of borrow-
ing funds Mr. Brookes, MLA. of Queensland, re-
cently moved that Hansard should publish verbatim
reports of all speeches delivered in the House. Luckily
for Bobby Byrne, the talented owner of all Brisbane
published humour, the resolution was not carried. And
the world has been cheated out of a delicious publication..
Old Billy Townsend (“ Billy Waxend " they called him),
late Chairman of Committees in the S.A. Assembly,
has di.d at last, after a long illness, aged 61. In recent
numbers of The Bulletin we gave personal remini )•
cenoes of this eccentric but genial politician Sir
Patrick Jennings told the Bogauites, the other evening,
that he and other members had worked together as one
man to obtain recognition ot the claims of the electorate
“and it may not be deemed unparliamentary that we
have endeavoured frequently to gain the assistance of
the representatives ot other constituencies to roll a
friendly little log." Charming candour, this.

Administered in a warm bath is the only method
by which every muscle, nerve, and bone, can be affected
at the same time. It removes chronic liver complaints,
congestion, tumours, rheumatism, &c., and rids the
system of all impurities ; even mercury is taken ont of
the body.

THE UPSTAIRS SHOWROOM has been made
longer, the high partition at the end having been re-
moved. This gives much additional space for display-
ing the large collection of Goods.
THE BARGAIN ROOM, to the left of the large
Fancy Goods Showroom, has been re-opened with many
leading lines of Furniture and general Household Re-
quisites.

Visitors to Sydney, who have heard and read so much
about THE ROYAL FURNISHING ARCADE gen-
erally look for a grand exterior, and it is not until they
enter our establishment that any disappointed feelings
vanish. They begin to wonder where they are going
more particularly if they enter at the Subterranean
Carpet-room. Those who enter thereat,and then traverse
the main Arcade floor, the up-stairs Showroom, aud the
Gallery, think it a regular journey. So it is, but the
room is absolutely necessary to carry on our extensive
business, and enable us to keep, in a systematic man-
ner, the regular supply of goods necessary to execute
the orders received through our never-failing and ever-
popular HDUSE FURNISHING GUIDE.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
In speaking of a certain Sydney P.M., the
Mudgee Independent says " His form is robust and
semi-corpulent, and his head is the shape of a midwinter
toad when engaged in the pastime of swallowing a
premature oyster-shell.”
The Penrith Argus says that Mr. Edward
Johnstone, for many years employed as guard on the
Western lino, has inherited £90,000 under the will of
his late father, Captain Johnstone, 8.N., of Aunandale.
Mr. Johnstone as a guard was a universal favonrite, and
no one rejoices more in his sudden accession to fortune
than his old mates on the railway.
Not long ago, a very fat politician, en route from
Temora, looked in at Harden, and while going from the
train to Walshe’s Hotel, got stuck in the turnstile and
remained jammed there a considerable time before he
could be released. N«xt day, when he departed, the
large gate had to be unlocked to let him through, as he
declined to face the turnstile again.
Mr. Pilliett, the New Zealand journalist who
has got into the House of Bepresentatives, is the best
abused member round about Stanmore. At one public
meeting there, a resolution was actually proposed,
“ That this meeting consider Mr. Pilliett a damned
rascal." (I) At a meeting at Phillipstown, an elector
brought down the house by stating: "Mr. Pilliett has
betrayed us; he would betray the devil."
Mr. M'Elhone said in the Assembly: “I
wonder if the House would adjourn if I slipped my
cable ?" which M‘Elhonian sentence was thus rendered
by|HANSARD : “It is possible that when some insignifl-
cant member of the House like myself quits this life,
the House may be asked to adjourn." That eminent
pressman, the Principal Shorthand Writer, is evidently
not in the habit of alluding to a spade aa an “ adjective
shovel."
In connection with the Queen’s kitchen, and its
accessory offices, 91 persons are employed. The chief
cook has £7OO per annum, his four assistants £320 each,
two confiseurs, for pantry and sweets only, £3OO. The
head butler has £5OO per annum ; and the royal plate is
looked after by three under butlers and seven cleaners.
Henry Faust, a law clerk, aged 30, whose
wile became first sick and then insane, tried to support
himself and two children on a skeleton salary, was
tnrown out of employment, and was found kneeling
beside their bed with his mouth full of tea-leaves —
dead. Yes, starved to death in London. There is no
connection between these two items of news.
Eraser-Smith, ef the Hongkong Telegraph,
appears to have taken his two months almost without
comment. This is all he says in reference to it: —“ For
bitting out in self-defence at one of the meanest rascals
that ever placed foot in this colony, for honouring a
miserable cur by condescending to treat
as if he were entitled to the privileges of all
honest men, by attacking him in the columns of the
Telegraph, insteadlof spurning him with his foot when-
ever ne met him, Mr. Boberc Fraser-Smith was sen-
tenced to two months imprisonment by Sir George
Phillips," There is a freedom from irritation in these
remarks that is very soothing. Mr. Fraser-Smith has
evidently acquired the art of suffering in silence.
Mr. P. Lee, M.R.C.S., Eng., objects to our
alluding to the Tichborne claimant as “ Orton," and
says that he can adduce 100 facts, any one of which
would prove to any reasonable person not only that the
claimant cannot possibly be Arthur Orton, but that he
is the real Simon Pure—the real genuine, original, and
only Sir Boger Charles Doughty Tichborne, Baronet.
If the Wagga batcher has in Australia many such
devotod followers as Mr. Lee, it’s quite plain that we
shall have k big Tichborne revival as soon as the claim-
ant gets out. And, by the way, there is a commission
coming all the way from England to see whether poor old
mad Cress well, who for years past has been in Parramatta
Lunatic Asylum, isn’t Arthur Orton, Who pays their
expenses. Heaven only knows.
Will D. C. F. Moodie, C.M.G., never die or
fade into obscurity ? His last project is to start a
" literary club," in Adelaide, and he actually got Chief
Justice Way to preside at the preliminary meeting.
The club is to be formed solely for the convenience of
literary men, journalists, members of universities, and
such members of the learned and other professions as
might be approved of on their individual merits by the
committee, the entrance fee for residents of Adelaide
to be one guinea, and the subscription one guinea a
quarter, country members to be admitted at half-price.
The name chosen was “The South Australian Literary
Club," and the promoters will, probably, not admit any
member of a lower status in society than a bootblack.
That Anderson scandal is not anything like
hushed up. Mrs. Anderson has informed us that her
husband intends proceeding against the Herald for
libel. We assured her that this was the very best thing
she could do, and no doubt the lawyers to be engaged in
the case will agree with us. By the way, the Daily
Telegraph has shamefully deserted Florence, A
voluminous report in Mrs. Anderson’s defence by a
free-lance pressman was handed over to the D.T. for
perusal. The editor promised his readers that an
abstract of the report would be published, as the
Herald had not given Mr. Anderson the right of reply.
The Bulletin last week cartooned that little scheme,
and since then circumstances have somehow occurred
to make pie-crust of the D.T.’s promise. The damages
in the projected action have not yet been fixed; bat
they will, probably, be something under a million.
The proprietor of the Dublin Freeman’s
Journal was recently enjoying that seclusion which Her
Majesty's gaol over there grants for insinuating that
some of the jurors who convicted a man namedHyndes
(since hanged) of murder were slightly “ obfuscated ”
the night before finding their careful verdict. This,
however, we urge, is scarcely proved, because the
Freeman admits that the only fluids supplied to the
jury between the rising of the Court in the afternoon
and the rising of the twelve " good men and true " next
morning were: “ Eight pints of beer, lone bottle of
sherry, three bottles of claret, six glasses of gin, and
thirty.five glasses of whisky and half a bottle of brandy.
Four of the festive Irolickers were abstainers. Claret
was divided between two, and others took van whisky."
We therefore see no cause for censure: the thing was
merely a wholesome little picnic, inasmuch as the eight
non-abstaining jurymen could by no possibility have
drunk more than thirteen nobblers each.
The Western Champion (Blackall, Q.) haa
some light observations on the marriage of Mr, Oscar
de batge, which we noticed a few weeks back as occur-
ring in England. “ All the village was aroused to
assist at the wedding obsequies ot a pure merino. It
was a very hot day, but the bridegroom was cool and
collected. Though the Sussex Expressive goes into
three columns over the affair, it does not give us the
information for which we specially hunger—viz., the
colour of Oscar’s hair, and the material of his waist-
coat. The sacred edifice was crowded with an audience
quite as numerous and almost as select as that which
met to hear Oscar spout in the Public Hall at Blackall.
It took three persons to tie the knot, and a full choir
and organ to usher out the gay procession. The bride
wore satin lace and orange flowers, diamonds, pearls,
and sapphires, ‘the gift of the bridegroom’ (hal
ha I don't know what we’re laughing at, but can’t help
it)—and the bridesmaids wore gold Maltese crosses set
with gems and gold chains, also * the gifts of the
bridegroom.’ It must have been a thumping price
fie Sat go and Co. got for station."
Some few years ago the Hon. Wyndham Stan-
hope (who is a consumptive young man, and should be
dear to all patriotic Australians by reason of the fact
that he says he obtains great relief from his pulmonary
troubles by using a certain preparation of eucalyptus),
married Madlle. Camille Dubois, a burlesque actress of
some note, and went to live with her at Madeira, after,
with great trouble, reconciling Lord Harrington, his
father, to the match. To Madeira came Lieut. Adye,
of the Bifles, fresh from Zululand. As Mr. Stanhope
somewhat of an invalid, the gallant lieutenant took
Mrs. S. about. Then all the parties went to England,
jmd lived for a while at Cowes. While there, Mr.
Stanhope accidentally discovered a copy of a telegram
from “ Mrs. Adye to Mr. Adye," and making further
inquiries, found out certain facts which culminated in
hm giving Mrs. Stanhope “ the run.” It is hardly
necessary to mention that Lieutenant Adye made use
01 his privileges as a friend to take away his friend’s
w ue. Cela sans dire. “It’s a way they have in the
army.” Proceedings have been commenced in the
hhverce Court, at the conclusion of which Mrs. Stan-
hope will probably return to the stage, and Mr. Adye
10 fight for his bleeding country.
Samuel de Young has [scraped through hia in-
solvency imprisonment at Adelaide. The ex-rag-and-
bottle-merchant-cum-miner - cum - bookmaker, applied
again for his certificate. He had been in gaol for
twenty months. The court thought that Sammy had
undoubtedly secreted a big portion of his estate in
Melbourne, and wanted to get over there to enjoy it.
The most the Commissioner offered was a third-class
certificate, under which any property Samuel acquired
could of course be made available to the creditors, but
even this was opposed by the official assignees and other
creditors, who seem to want to “jug” Da Young up for
his natural life, as a human curiosity. However, at
last the Commissioner let him out on his own recog-
nisance for twelve months—till when the hearing was
adjourned. This will keep Sammy in South Australia,
probably, as, if he doesn’t appear at the end of the year
to renew his application, he will become a felon. De
Young is either a very obstinate man, or has not got a
“ plant." His very pertinacity is modifying the very
hot opinion the public first held of him. We suggest
to his creditors that the estate would materially benefit,
if they raised the wind by taking casta of De Young’s
Apollo-like features, and selling them to all the colonial
Art Galleries. Sines he was run over by a tramcar, he
always wears a very expressive look.
It will be remembered that when Mr. Pickwick
wished to accompany Mr. Wardle’s shooting-party in a
wheelbarrow, the long gamekeeper waxed very indig-
nant, stating that such an innovation was without pro-
cedent in the history of sport. Civilization has evi-
dently made strides since this; for now we read that
the Maharajah Dhuleep Sing “ shoots the covers on bis
estate adjoining the Prince of Wales's at Sandringham,
sitting in a luxurious arm-chair with obsequious attend-
ants to hand him a succession of loaded guns." Dhuleep
never misses, for it takes the gamekeepers ail their
time to prevent the pheasants from sitting on the
barrel of his musket. Frequently in an organized
hattus —twelve or fifteen hundred of a bag is made,
and still the small (farmers on the estate only get
coarse bread and fat bacon to worry. The Maharajah,
who is pensioned by the British Government, writes to
the Tims, by-tho-way, complaining that his screw of
£25,000 has been reduced in order to meet bis liabilities.
He asks for more “ sug." and will probably get it, but
still the peasants will, we should say, eat fat bacon
even more furiously than before. The Maharajah is,
however, very popular with the English aristocracy.
On State occasions he bundles himself up in a gorgeous
Indian shawl, all crimson and gold, and his appearance,
therefore, may be said not only to " take well," but as
Alfred says, to “ give pleasure to all.” When in Lon-
don, he and his two sons live at the Alexandra Hotel, a
beautiful caravanserai j ust facing Hyde Park, and in
a splendid turn-out do the “ Ladies’ Mile" daily. Their
appearance excites much interest and wonderment in
the breasts of the youth of London, the popular idea
being that these dusky princes subsist entirely upon
cat-currie, and that nocturnal requisitions in search of
the feline species are made at frequent intervals by the
Indians themselves. Thus, while the vagrant juveniles
amuse themselves in following the stilts and the punch
and judy s home to their own doors of a morning, in the
afternoon they devote their energies to the Maharajah
and suite ; a proceeding on their part which is but in-
differently appreciated by the princely pensioners. They
are at every royal gathering, and (we presume) at every
picnia. Their genuineness should, therefore, be gener-
ally accepted.
Since Mrs, Henry Labouohere is Mrs. Langtry’s
bosom friend, a lot of people have begun to get in-
terested in her. Well, dear ladies, let us at once tell
you that Mrs. L.’s maiden name was Georgiana Hod-
son, and that she was an actress of great and exceeding
merit—shining not only in light tragedy, but in comedy
and burlesque also. She nearly always had a theatre
of her ewn—sometimes the loyalty and sometimes the
Queen’s, is Long Acre—which, however, is now pulled
down. Before people were in the secret of her mar-
riage, much wonder was wont to be expressed at the
frequent appearance of her name as a manageress; the
mors especially as having hobbies in regard to selecting
supporters, her companies were frequently badly
chosen, and crashing pecuniary losses the result. She
had a Shakespearean season once, and placed boxes in
the theatre, supplying the audience with ballotting
papers, in order that she might produce at the end of
each month the Shakespearean drama selected by the
public. It didn’t work, however; for whilst the face-
tious pitites put in only nutshells and suggestions of a
humorous nature, the majority of the ether people
either took no notice of the boxes at all, or else in-
cluded such pieces as “ Jack Sheppard ” amongst the
works of the immortal bard. When Mrs. Bousby first
came out, she was “ taken up " by Mrs. Labouohere,
but quickly dropped on evincing proclivities, poor
thing, of a decidedly giddy character. Mrs. Langtry,
however, is only in love with gowns and stockings. So,
therefore, there is no fear of the Jersey Lily meeting
with a like fate. Mrs. Labouohere, as it was proved
during the hearing of Lambri Fashi v. Labouohere,
does not mix amongst the very exalted, her “ set"
rather being that one remove from the creme de la creme
bo deliciously described by Thackeray in “Vanity
Fair.” At her disposal, however, is unbounded wealth.
An idea will be formed of her husband's means by this
little incident:—Some years ago, Mr. L., who is a large
speculator in the Stock Exchange, employed two
brokers, who, getting into difficulties, forged cheques
upon him at Contis’ to the extent of £15,000 —all in
the space of six months 1 Labouohere, however, didn’t
discover the fraud, and when, at length, it all came out
through an accident, he wrote up to the police from
some place at which he was shooting, saying "he wasn’t
going to be bothered” to come up and prosecute. In
the end he was forced to do so, and the man were
sentenced to a long term. Mrs. Labouohere “ admits ”
40.

A Court of Inquiry has been ordered by Con-
gress into the loss of the Arctic steamer Jeannette, and
the death of De Long. There are rumours ef jealousy
and discord among her officers from the day of starting.
The welcome of Lieutenant Dannenhower, on bis re-
turn, was not enthusiastic, and many of his brother
officers were absent. Much more light will be thrown

Alma, Inkermann, Sebastopol, and Balaclava, alse in
the suppression of the Indian Mutiny. He was a

A NEW AUSTRALIAN POET.
After all, though they don’t seem to know very
much about ns in England, we are getting gradually
respected. Frozen meat has done something for na;
Parkes’s visit a little more; and literature the rest.
Before Alfred conceived the brilliant idea of sending
home an own commissioner, the London people did not
give us credit for being dons at fine rhythmic periods—
for delicately descriptive prose. But now the
British lien can curl his tail in a bit, for we have not
only told him how to accept a good cigar in a graceful
manner, but we have pointed out the exact topo-
graphical position of Boston. Hardly, however, had
we established our position in prose, than, lo and be-
hold, an Australian bard —Mr. D. B, W. (no less)
Sladen—by publishing a volume of poems, does as
much for us in the realms of rhyme as Alfred has in
the province of prose. Mr. Sladen has hit upon a sin-
gularly musical title for his poems. Here it is:—
11 Frithjof (!) and Ingehjorg (!) and other Poems. By
D. B. W. Sladen, an Australian colocoist."
• • »
In an introductory piece, the author states —r*nd
mark the truly beautiful verse in which, he seta it
forth—that
“ Australia sends this book of song
To England, not so much in, hope
That it will take its place among
The brotherhood of wider scope.
But rather that it will be read
By those who take this volume up,
Remembering where it was bred.*’
This is truly great; the words italicised denoting, as
will be seen, the true afflatus. This we, of course,
commend, but we must take exception to the implica-
tion (though not the poetry) embodied in another
piece. He says—or rather—hang it I—sings—
“ We have not yet lived fifty years.
But, as the swift hours onward flow.
We, too, shall breed poetic peers
For Arnold and for Tennyson. . . ."
“ Shall breed 1” Well, we admire this; we do, indeed.
How about Meaden, and Sir Henry Parkes, and Phil
M’Carroll, and Pastor Allen, and Lewis Scott P Is Ned
Baly dead, and has “ Australia ” thrown down the lyre
and taken up the flat-iron. No, no 1 Being brilliant
himself, Mr. Sladen forgets others who have an equal
claim to succeed to the laurels of Longfellow—the bays
of Browning.
« • •
But it is not especially in his published volume
that Mr. I). B. W. Sladen shines. His fugitive pieces
have attracted considerable notice—more especially
in Queensland, where he seems to be revered. Mr.
Sladen, who, by the way is a B.A. (we print the letters
without appending any invidious interpretation), was
for long (and is now, for aught we know) the chosen
laureate of Buzacott, the present editor of the Quekks-
lindee, a gentleman who, from a literary point of view,
is regarded by some cynics to be “a little bit off his
Kadoova." A delightful piece d'occasion by this sweet
singing S’aden is now before us. The poem in question
was written on receipt of the intelligence of the
bombardment of Alexandria, and is, as will be presently
seen, in very much the same style as that immortal epic
(by the same author) which was inspired by the death
(truly pathetic I) of the late heroic Mrs. Watson p— one
verse of which (relating to the feeding of the child)
ended thus—
11 And preserved milk seemed to agree with it-”
• * •
The language in “ The Day of the Nile ” is no
less lofty, while the sentiments—domestic, martial, and
patriotic, are worthy so great a poet. His mode of
rhyming, is, it will be noticed, somewhat similar to
that adopted by Mr. Samuel Weller, in his romance
of Dick Turpin, which it will be remembered com-
mences thusly
** Dick Turpin vunce on Hounslow Heath
His bold mare Bess bestrode her.
Yen, lo, he see the Bishop's coach
A cornin’ along the road er.”
Now for Mr. Sladen (B.A.);
** The shades of night have fallen round us
Here in Australia;
The hour-hand verges upon seven
Of a mid-winter day.”
He is Bitting with his wife and child,
*• While, gorgeous in the sunset splendour
Of an Egyptian bay.
The might of England lies at anchor
Off Alexandria.”
This is before he gets warmed np; but in a moment
later we have our author in the “ 'Ercles vein "s
“ And, just as I sit down to dinner.
Were sweeping proudly in
To the red banquet that awaited
Their coming to begin.
“ And here, I feel, my wife is reading
My face with rueful eyes—
Trying to catch the thoughts that traverse
My dumb soliloquies.”
Mrs. S., however, seems to find trying with “rueful
eyes” (rueful, no wonder!) to catch her husband’s
soliloquize, rather a prosy proceeding, for, later, this
immortal work tells us
“ The sweet gray orbs shake off their slumbers,”
and she says (sensibly enough, poor thing I) “a truce to
that old war.” Not to be licked, he follows upon the
same side —but read him :
“ And I shake off my inward slumbers,
And, pressing the ripe lips.
Whisper to her that I've been dreaming
Of grand old-fashioned ships."
Whether she gets the Yankee broom to him at this
juncture does not transpire, but what he does is.to
“ Breathe a prayer for our sailors
Upon the battle-day.
Standing on England’s iron bulwarks
Off Alexandria.”
* • •
It will thus be seen that, since Mr. Sladen
represents ns in the poetic line, there is no fear of our
being forgotten in England for some time to come. We
are all right, then, as regards poetry; onr prose is
acknowledged to be brilliant; George Darrell's “ new
and original " drama is to be produced in London •• at
the fall ” (thus the dramatic gap will be filled up); and,
now, if we could but persuade Joseph Eckford, Esq .
M.P., to go over and give them a touch of his oratorical
qualities, we feel that we should speedily become, not
only known and respected, but positively feared in the
great city over the sea.

Academy of Music. —The Mastodon Minstrels ib.
“‘TiM. nights ” —except when nervous men play
Hamlet "—are visually pleasant nights. Bit st nights
at the Eo/al are invariably so. But the first of “ The
Mascotte ’’ was more than ordinarily enjoyable, simply
because, the event taking place on a Wednesday, the
“ chosen people ” were unable to get away, in a flock,
from their various pursuits, and gave the unfortunate
Gentiles a show for a few front s-.ats. The audience
was more than usually brilliant. White ties were
numerous, and crippled opera-glasses in great pro-
fusion ; while there was enough silver jewellery in our
immediate vicinity to stoct a tinman or to copper a
ship. Talking of opera-glasses, feeling sceptical anent
the power of our own, we politely borrowed those held
by a young lady next to us, who sported a “negligd”
; and locnet that made a noise when she moved like the
. clank of a Paddington Portergalf in full marching
order. We took a sight at Maggie Moore, being
anxious to see how she fastened on her wooden shoes.
'Then the hollowness of the world became apparent!
' Through these glasses Mrs. Williamson looked like an
1E Idystone lighthouse on a misty morning—the statue
. of Prince Consort in a fog—a white squall in the China
.seas —all these as you varied the focus We thea re-
turned the young lady her glasses with a sunny smile,
■saying, ‘‘A very nice pair, a very nice pair indeed
jßut, er —you have forgotten to light the candle inside ”
We then quicaly shifted in order to avoid death by the
another's fan. The old lady, however, had her revenge
isubsequently by expressing her surprise to the usher
That the management allowed the bellman in the dress-
•circle.
• • #
“ La Mascotte ” is a comic opera in three long
acts, tne music bp Andran, and the libretto by those
gentlemen who have been introduced to the Sydney
public through tde medium of the D.T. as “ Ghivor
and Darn, ’ “Chivet and Dura,” and “Chuvot and
Dorn,” but whose real names are Chivot and Darn.
The libretto of these authors his been adapted into
English by Messrs. Robert Reece and H. B. Par nie, and
translated into Australian by Mr. H. 11. Harwood. The
■original book ha-, theref >re, undergone considera le
modifications, everything “giddy” in connection with
the loves of Pippo and Bettina having been excised, and
all the boulevard witticisms of Rocco and the Duke
Raving been lopped ofl ky amorally judicious applica-
tion of tbe “P.K." To us these excisions alfoidun-
limited satisfaction. When we were young and prattled
rat our nurse’s knee, we were taught to model ours fives
upon Joseph. And we have done so. We have never
put any pieces of silver in our brothers’ sacks, simply
because, after settling up the weekly hills, we have
never had any silver over. Neither, by the same token,
have we ever administered a majestic rebuke to Mrs.
.Potiphar—chiefly for tbe reason that, generally,
when we have been in company with that lady,
~ivTr. Potiphar has been prowling round with a
stick. But, for »11 that, we ere nothing with-
•out morality, and being moral we trust we are
:a great deal —or, if not a great deal, at least
isomething. Well, to tell the truth, Messrs. Reece and
Parnie’s version is not uartisularly side-splitting when
istudied purely as a literary effort, hut of Mr. Harwood’s
Australian edition we can safely say that it is a daringly
reckless piece of foolery right through, and that of the
■very many Dukes he has played, this partieular one
•exceeds them all in ludicrous business and in gags of
an outrageously unblushing nature.
• • •
Of the plot which has been persistently hurled
at the public for the last three weeks, we will say
nothing. The word “ plot ” is too closely allied to
‘passion” to allow us of repeating the story of “La
Mascotte.” It will suffice to say, however, that it’s a
very nice story, indeed. Like Archibald Grosvenor’a
sonnet, there is nothing in it calculated to bring a
blush to the cheek of the modestest cf maidens. The
action centres in the adventures of The Lack-Bringer,
and there was never a character more appropriately
cast thm in the choice of Maggie Moore to enact the
titlerdie of the piece. Por if ever there was a veritable
Mascotte on the stage, Miss Maggie is the party.
And more than this, ihe part is one which
might | (have been written for her. All through
the opera she is brimming over with fun—revelling
in the gawcheries which comprise so large a portion of
her business. Her rendering of the music—it is not
too much to say —pleaaed the audience thoroughly.
In saying this we do not of course assert that the
charming Maggie is a Nilsson. And talk of a recep-
tion I What pounding of boot-heels, what grinding of
palms, what battering of ferules, what rattling of fans.
But the pit 1 When she appeared, hundreds of mouths,
which had only been passively awful, extended them-
selves into pillar box slits, and became a terrible spec-
tacle; expectant eyes danced at her like jellies; while
awful children, that had previously been partially
hidden by hand-baskets and red shawls, were held up
by “ father” to look at the popular star, a proceeding
which was received with much indignation uy the
ladies and gentlemen immediately behind. “ Holler-
away !”
• # •
Mr. Harwood, as we have said, plays the Duke,
and he makes the people laugh all the time. His is
really a performance wnich, when we consider it to be
an original conception, cannot be otherwise classed
than a. 9 a big success. In opera bouffe, Mr.
H. suffers from being at a disadvantage vocally. When
von shut your eyes and hear him a ter the nightingale
' *orts of—s»y little Nellie—it sounds as though the
e V '•tingalo had swdlowed an owl, and the owl was
? lg; * to get out. But watch him while he sings, and
trying t ftU ftbout VOC al defects in his
„ -sting, and his well-conceived by-play. As
capital a Edwin Kelly has come out of his shell in
rtocco, , lant manner, and, in the last act more
ISIa P rlv I** especially shims. He sings well,
particularly, i \ tlll J maAe up . H is, buiness t. o,
S ’ There??, therefore, as will be seen, nothing
rococo about Rocco.
• • •
Pippo, the lover, is, of course, enacted by Signor
■Rillureeno Verdi. It is Miv Verox’s pleasant lot always
to S the lover’s part. S.e what it is to be very
beautifull We wat. hod th.'S assumption of a rustic
swain by Archibald Grosvenor with much interest. We
wanted see if we could detect ovtn a soupjon of
Archibald the All ight in it—aud we did detect that,
but no more. This state nent, however, wont do
Monsieur —or Signor, which is itf-any harm with our
contemporaries, since the idea prevailing m the minds
of most of them is that soupy on mesns dinner-time
_ ap ° l} ful term for hash. Next to lus Grosvenor, we
consider that Pipyo is the best thing Verdi has done-
out of Italy, He sings the music in a manner that is
musically robust, and speaks the lines in a manner that
is robustly musical. When he comes on, all the girls
ia the d'csk-circle nudge one another and say : Hush,
here’s Verdi;” and when he goes off they all sign line
f hp ** PatUnca ** maiden# used to do after his toucnmsj
dialogue abo?t the squirt. . Mr Verdi hoks love y in
steeps tin, and beautiful in his other dresses. We
wouldn’t advise him,though,to eat no more beef than he
can help for a bit. He is visible to the—pardon, ladies
—naked eye.
• • •
,Mr. W. H. Woodfield, who enacts Fritellini, a
dandy, who is always going to “ positively expire,” is a
young tenor whom the programmes tell US was
“ extremely popular ” in England. He is al-
ready very popular here. Mr. W. has a nice
voice, but he has not enough of it to enable him to be
able to dispense with calves. As, however, he had very
bad luck (dramatically) in the first act, he may possibly
with a view of raising the wind have let them out to
Rocco, the farmer. If so, it seems rather a pity he
didn’t buy them baek when he had a “ throw in ” later
in the piece. However, Mr. Woodfield is very nice, in-
deed, and we have no doubt that since his first appear-
ance about 2500 Lauds-office boys and bank clerks have
forbidden their girls m pain of a final separation either
to pass the Theatre Royal in the morning, or to do the
bloek in the afternoon. As a Pergeant, Mr. W. H.
Harrison hadn’t much to do, and very nicely he did it.
Mr. Ben Levison and Mr. J. S. Porter (two great un-
knowns) played respeo'ively aninnkeeper »nd a peasant,
allright; and Mr. I’homas Winter, and Mr. Benjamin
were eloquently mute as two lords-in-waiting.
• * •
Miss Nellie Stewart had a part in Fiametta very
similar to that of the Countess in “ Olivette,” and one
of her dresses, too, resembled in gorgeousness, but
excelled in taste the splendid costume we and all*
the rest of (he bald-headed remember her look-
ing so bewildering in when Musgrove treated us to
that gigantic spectacle. A good while ago, we
told this young lady that while she was endowed with
considerable histrionic and local gifts she had a good
deal to learn. Well, Miss Nellie is learning it. We do
not tell her that she is very pretty, and all that sort
of thing, because a lot of fellows whose eyebrews are
on their temple’, and whose brains are in their socks,
have told her this eloquently long ago. But what we
do tell her is that if she will take the same amount of
trouble in evolving the conception of a part as she does
in dressing and even singing it, there are great things
in store for her And great things mean —but possibly
Miss Stewart is not mercenary We are. Miss Maggie
btewart (her sister), Miss Ida Osborne, Miss Lily
Porde, aad Miss Mary Downward (eheu!) and Sally
Porde (who we believe has been recently starring with
Sydney Grundy at the T. R. Jimboombah), was a
peasant girl, anil she looked lovely. We couldn't dis-
tinguish her ourselves, but we’ll risk that any how.
Why shouldn’t wo risk that little in criticism, when
some of our contemporaries risk so much ?
• • #
The dresses and scenery are both stupendous.
Maggie Moore, for example, changes her dress no less
than five times, while all the other principals have
nearly as many changes The art displayed in the
dresses is wonderful. They are not only all gorgeous
as to material, but harmonious in design. T he opera,
in short, is a series of lovely pictures and delicious
groupings, the whole denoting an expenditure of money
which the managerm nt cannot exaggerate by terming
“fabulous." Than Mr Gordon's three stage pictures,
it would, we should say, be impossible to do anything
better. The Pa ace scene in the second act secured
for him a call aud an ovation He took both very
quietly. We trust when we get an ovation on our first
appearance on the platform at the Y.M.C A. meeting,
we shall be able to take the honour as modestly.
« * «
It ia not only diffiiulb. but it is uplucky, to pre-
dict the run of a piece But still we will venture to
state posi'ively that “ The Mascotte ’ will run at the
Theatre Royal until it is tiken off by the management.
* * * *
We went round between the showers tbe other
night to see the “Royal Middy,” yet asain. Our
ojimion of it has not altered. It is bright as a crystal
girandole and has a vivacity and Man about it that are
very taking The plot, of course, is pretty thin, and
spectral is the only adjective we can use to describe
most of the jokes Bat they all go off like Chinese
crackers, which is very much to their credit, as most
things at their age would not be able to move. Por
instance, the audience lie back and scream at Fan-
chette's orange-slinging episode. This is an old
American resurrect. But the music is charming.
Miss Melvil e interprets her numbers deliciously, and
the air sung by Mr. Parley to the fancied accom-
paniment of an imaginary guitar is sensuously sweet.
# * *
We wondered for a long time how it was that
Armes Beaumont's splendid voice had such a woody
sound in some of the solos. At last we discovered the
reason. “ Biron,” the Rochefoucauld of the 1 ribune,
whose brilliantly epigrammatic paragraphs have already
made him an undying reputation among buttermen,
was sitting in frent of us, and the sound had to pass
through his‘head before it reached us. That was all.
• • •
The plot of the piece is ingenious but impro-
bable. The audience are left in Cimmerian gloom as to
how Panchette arranged her passage from Paris to
Lisbon. The theory that she could come over in
Pergy’s boots will not hold water, baeause the boats
of that Maecenas of the Frees are said to leak. Other-
wise the incidents in the piece are possible.
• • «
Emelie’s sweet face we have pictured in
our front page this week, for the especial ueneflt of our
clerical subscribers. We believe wa sail before
that the performers in tbe “Royal Middy” were
all respectably fair. Mew wo say that tney are goo:‘.
Parley is grand, and Casselli is very funny. Ha ia
one of the funniest actors we know, not even ercepting
Greville. Everything he dees is laughed at, aud waen
he does nothing at all the laughter swells to maniac
pitch.
# • •
We don’t want to examine too closely the
structure of the “ Royal Middy.” The cause of any.
thing is of little consequence if the effect no
Whenonrnerves are shattered andoar heads throbbing,
do we qsairel with a Daily ielegeaph leader because
it contains no sense, if io sends us afieep ? Hardly.
And so it is of small moment wnether the libretto or
the music of this opera are very new or sparklingiy
bizarre, if they amuse us. And they do amu=e us.
* * * *
“Truth ” is now over at the Gaiety, where it
did not prove a draw. Many reasons may be adduced
for this, but not an nnimpor ant one is that the pro-
duction was greatly marred by the slip-shod manner
in which some of the actresses walked through their
parts. It is a pitiful thing to have to contemplate
young ladies, who have really some natural ability,
speaking their lines like charity boys gabbling their
spelliug tasns, and with an expression which tells the
audience plainly that they neither know anything nor
care anything about tbe motif of the play they are
helping to interpret. Better comedies than “ Truth ”
have been damned by better acting than that recently
displayed by two young actresses to whom were appor-
tioned effective though slightly subordinate parts.
We wish to point out to these ladies that though it is
bad enough to play to the pit in pantomime, that mode
of performance is fatal to comedy. It looks stupid
when you are asked a questiou by your lover, to
“ sling” the answer at a hoy sucking an orange twenty
yards off. Mr. Towers, it strikes us, is by no means
strict enough with his ladies. He should insist upon
each of them being thoroughly familiar with the whole
of the piece before allowing her to take a part in it. It
is our experience that too much care cannot be given
to matters of detail in connection with! plays (that do
not depend upon spectacular effect for their success.
** * *
It ia re'reshin? to note that Mr. Prank Towers
is not only an acoor, but an author. Shakespeare was
the same, and also, some feeble old ctirauioiois affirm,
Marlowe IN . ther cf these, however, ever wrote
“ Maggie’s Dream.” They couldn’t have done it. It is
too gorgeous. I; is a play which, while Saakespeare’s
plays will only live for a few centuries, will exist for
ever. * Maggie's Dream ’’ is a piece which, like some
of tha Bard o( Avon’s works, is alternately tragic and
comic. But Mr. Towers’ play is rather cao-e so. Wiicu
tragic it la delicioufiy comic, and when comic it is
terrifically tragic. It is the kind of piece that you
would dream of after misconducting yoursilf with tripe
and onions.
• « •
The nterpretation, however, was great. Miss
Rosa T ’wars played the part of Gratty, a servant, with
considerable success. She was alternately pathetic and
comic. But, by reason of tha eccentricities of the
author, she was very often comic in tha pathetic
lines, and pathetic ia the comic ones. Miss
Rosa, however, is a very clover little lady.
She has a beautifully expressive face, an! any
amount of pretty gestures and melting glances. And
i he works very hard. This is a great thing. Thera
are some actresses of [Miss Towers’ age, who consider
that to “ come on” and ” get through it” is sufficient.
Rosa’s performance, however, is a wholesome lesson to
these voung ladies—and one they would do well to profit
by. Miss Emma Bronton played a wife who had been
“giddy,” and when the “joker” had cleared had be-
come repentant, very nicely indeed. Miss Emma has
a nice face, and a very nice figure, and was generally
successful. Hetty Maddooks, according to our gifted
contemporary the Rum, was “most creditably performed
by Miss Theresa Horan.” This indeed, is “praise from
Sir Hubert Stanley.” We will, however, say more than
this. We will emphatically state that the part of
Hetty Maddooks was played with a delicate humour
and artistic playfulness, and a generally delicious
abandon —but it. was not played by Miss Theresa H artn.
The part was interpreted by an actress whose name
will live when that of Ristori is forgotten. Wo allude
to Miss Nelly Playfair.
# # »
The other ladies consisted of Miss May Vivian,
ajtat (say) 30, and Miss Adelaide Towers, m at 11. Miss
Vivian is a lady who is surpassingly beautiful, but, If
we had to choose between he>- and Modjeska, we think
we ihoald choose Miss May Vivim. She hasn't muoh
to do as Sally, and she does is extremely well. If she
had more to do, perhaps she would do it better. This
is possible—barely possible.
• • •
Mr. G. R. Ireland enacts the role —it is difficult
to vary your phraseology in dramatic criticism—of
Henry Carlton, a merchant, whose partner takes away
his wife, and he goes blind. After this, he is led about
the beach at the seaside by Mus Rosa Towers, and
apparently makes a living without either a bar jo or an
organ. Mr. Ireland was exceedingly good. So good,
indeed, that his performance—let ue plagiarise
irom the wax-works advertisements—i« “alone worth
the price of admission.” Mr Prank Tewers gets
all the ‘‘fat" In a very comic part, and hs
is veer successful in entertaining the audience. We
like Mr. Towere se muoh in this part that we intend to
go every night to see him. Mr. J. H. Rainford plays
the immoral man (Graves Vernei), who rues away with
his partner’s Missis, and afterwards grows a pair of
whiskers. Mr. Rainford Is very effective—so muoh so,
that we won’t ask him round to our boarding-house
when there is a chance of our not being at home. Mr.
Cates was a curate, in a frock coat, and Mr. Joyce a
doctor, in a white tie; and something in a very seedy
black suit played a part not set down in the programme.
We should like to know theuams of this man, Por we
want to kill him.
* * «
On the whole, we liked “ Maggie’s Dream ”
very much. And we liked the “ Swiss Cottage," too,
more than very much. By the w,»y, we didu’c see the
Swiss Cottage. But wo read our Telegraph.
» * * *
It was at a theatre in the back-blocks of Brazil.
Wo were there. The manager was a Hebrew of the first
snuffle. We amused ourselves during the setting of
one of the scenes by attempting a life-size sketch of
this gent eman’s nose. This was the first time we ever
realised what a thoroughly aristocratic people the
Hebrews are. As the slip of copy-paper we had brought
was only a yard long, we had to give up trying to repro-
duce the nose after we had got as far as tha bridge.
This suggested something to us that wo have never seen
in any scriptural commentaries, and which might be
found worthy of serious consideration. Is it not
possible that the passage describing the downfall of the
walls ef Jericho at the sound of trumpets is only an
Oriental way of poeticising the prosaic fact that
Joshua called out one of this gentleman’s ancestors
from the old-hat division of the Yidisher army, end
commanded him to sneeze thrice under the battlements ?
This theory is altogether eur own, and we are as proud
of it as we suppose that mammoth-conked ancestor
was of his nose.
* * * *
Oh, and we quite forgot to mention that Frank
Cates and Miss Kate Dougins gave an entertainment up
North the othtr day. The local tom-tom-bea‘ ers,
when they heard that Prank’s little show was coming,
decided to “humiliate” themselves and hold a prnyer-
meeting for rain on his opening night. Rain didn’t
come for a fortnight afterwards, but Frank experienced
a bit of a frost, and now thoroughly believes in the
efficacy of prayer.
* * * *
Here is a chunk of the very latest, most edify-
ing and popular ditty sung in the London music halls: —
“ Give me a ’bus fare, ducky.
Do, like a darling, dear,
Or bring me a hot potato—
I feel so awfully queer ;
Your eyes are so dreadfully wicked.
You cannot hiss me now—
You might have done so a week ago.
But I’m living with mother now.”
* ** *
On Tuesday night, we washed our face and put
on a clean collar in ordar to go round to the Academy
of Music. This temple of dramatic art has become so
high-toned and is so crowded with the first families
since Billy Wilson’s wonderful work was produce! that
it has grown necessary to be quite ceremonious when
visiting it. The “ Pi-rats of Peus-unklea ” is certainly
a weird affair. Billy need have no fear now of ranging
up besides Shakespeare or Lewis Scott.
* * «
The piece is very funny, though. But the’ jokes
are lost for want of omphasDimr, and the songs (ail flat
ac times for lack of spirit and “go.” We have at last
arrived at the sorrowful conclusion that no dramatic
ability can come out of Soudan or Surry Hills. Billy
Wilson is the saviour of tha show.
* * * *
It rained so hard during the Montague-Tnrnet’s
season at Mait'and, that Chawles’ “ Pair Land of

Our Adelaide correspondent, with his customary
irrepressible facetiousness, informs us that crowded
houses are still wanting at Wybert Reave s shows at
the Royal in Adelaide. But then the people over there
are so hard to phase. Long familiarity with the highest
samples of Continental art has, no doubt, turned them
against common colonial performances. Mr. Reeve is
said to be the limpest “Colonel” in tbe universe, aid
poor Lena Ellis is characteris e as a “ bogus testhete ”
Miss Alice Deorwyn is “rather liked" as Mrs. Wil-
loughby B yth; while Palmer and Emmett as htreybe
and Basil Gior.ione, and Mrs. Palmer as Lady Tomp-
kins, are set down as ‘Shocking ixamp'esof how the
thing should not under any possible circumstances be
done.” “Diplomacy” follows “ The Colonel.”

When Mr. Crummies requested Nickleby to
write a show-piece, the great sensational attraction of
which was to be the introduction of a real pump and
two spiendid tubs “ bought cheap," aud declared,
“ that's tha London plan,” he was probably unaware
that ho was really prophesying the exact state of the
19th century stage. We have had express trains, live
horses, real saw-pits, hungry bloodhounds, and even
the proverbial pumps and tubs (all bought cheap, no
doubt) on osr own small boards, but Drury Lan« has
gone a point better still, and in tha play called
“ Pluck,” now being performed, actually treats the
aulience to a railway collision scene. One of the
carriages is up-ended by the shock—another tilled with
live passengers is telescoped, and so real is the concern
that the whole of the oars have to be thickly padded to
prevent loss of life,—though, by the way, we tail to see
tha necessity for this precaution, as there are heaps of
starving poor in England. Now is the season for some
colonial Shakespeare to arise and blast out of his fertile
brain a drama, the chief feature of which will bo an
explosion of the 900 tons of Goat Island dynamite and
gunpowder, and the general blowing to eternal smash
of the whole theatre, actors, and audience—special
provision being first made to secure a front scat for the
immortal author.

Drury Lane's great rival has also secured the
services of a Mr. Crummies wno, has fixed up a
spectacular drama, ca'led " Fourteen Days’’—the
leading sensation of wh ch is the introduction of a big
menagerie (ooaght cUeap also); aud the worrying to
death each Light by a “ gummy,” old, crippled lion, of
a “property" Queen, who costs about two thillings
for repairs after every show. Another speciality at this
theatre is the advertising of this chef-d'oeuvre ty n eaus
of a gang of the Sandwioh Board Brigade, dressed after
various fashions to represent the diffireat animals con-
tained in the manager’s menagrrie. Tbe first day this
assorted crowd ware pail eff, however, they were
treated handsomely, and of course taey religiously got
drunk. Tbe landlord then ran them nut, and the fun
began. They were all arrayed in their advertising rig,
but they soon proved to be anything but a happy
family. First of all the elephantfsll throuarh a Parisian
milliner’s window, and squashed about £2OO worth of
the latest bonnets, hats, &o. Whilst an excited
kangaroo hopped madly around, and roared in a rich
Tipperary brogue, “ By th' holy frasht, av’ any wan
thrids on my thail agin. I’ll naythur kick him, nor bate
him, but I’ll bhrake his heart with fall#," two street
dogs went for a Polar b»ar, and after a lively
scrimmage tore him limb from limb, and strewed the
pavements for yards with his sawdust stuffing; the
Bengal tiger staggered up against a lady passing, and
Bint her carefully “to grass” in the gutter; after
which, the husband cams np snd put a bead on his
Indian majesty as big as a load of wool. This roused the
pugnacious spirit of the donkey, represent ed by a “ chiel
fra Glasgie, so he slewed suddenly round, and kiokod in
the ribs of an unoffending lion—who immediately doffed
his hide and wiped the streets with Sandy’s spine. An
Arabian camel now observed to a Brazilian panther
that the Mu’rowney’s “wer as dacint an’resphteoabil
a family as the Malqaeeny’s any day av th’ week, an a
grate dale betther, too. on the Sundays;” upon wh.rffi
the panther peeled off and gave the “ ship of the
deiert” the “fathur av abatin’,” dating the excite-
ment of which Mulrowney caught the prairie buffalo a
“ pollthoage on th’ shnoat,” which induced him to go
for a Madagascar monkey. And, when the wild horao
of Tartary had done with tbe ourang.outang, it took tha
latter (our hours to find out which end of him wanted
rubbing most. Prom information received, the police
then came on the scene, but the whole show was so
laughable that they oould only lie over on their backs
and jell, so the sandwichers then closed np and had a
general stags rally, after which all hands dispersed,
greatly pleaaed with their “wholesome fun ’’—especially
the big baboon and the “ bowld little bhoy fram

The new Bishop of Adelaide is a total abstainer :

A noted den has just been broken up in Auck-
land. Some years ago, a fc’rocch woman amassed a
large sum of money by trading in girls. S> scandilout
became her proceedings, that at last she had to fly ro
America. She came back, and started her infamous
business afresh. But a tmshrnan was hoonssad and
robbed in one night of £3O. and this brought the end.
Information being given to the detectives, they made a
raid on the premises of the notorious Madame Valen-
tine, and arrested the two girls who had decoyed the
bnshman to the house and “ bilked ” him. They con-
fessed, stating that " Val ” had compelled them to rob
him bv threats of hammering. Most of the money was
found, also the son of a respected citizen, secreted
among the dust and cobwebs in the roof, reached by a
trap-door. This youth had been Madame ‘‘Vais’’
latest favourite paramour, and had lived on her gains.
Madame herself got temporarily away, but the “ d.’s '*
ran her down in the ti-tree scrub. Before the Court,
the lady sobbed pathetically, and made free use of a
perfumed and broidered handkerchief, but she did not
succeed in meltirg the Bench. Legislative influmoe

PEPPER AND SALT.
A FATAL BANQUET.
(IN SYDNEY.)
There entered in aa eating-house
A new-chum who was quite a nob,
And told the waiter quick to serve
A dinner for the usual bob.
The cloth was like a map of Spain,
All stained with rings and blotches dread;
There was no mustard in the pot.
But lots of mustard on the bread.
The waiter, sad to say, was in
A picturesquely grimy state.
And as he brought the soup along.
His thumb was hidden in the plate.
" Hi! waiter,” soon a voice did call;
Then stopped he in his Blenching walk,
And, lot he scratched perplexedly
His touzled head with someone’s fork.
The soup had greasy icebergs in
(To similes we will not stoop I
Suffice to say it tasted and
It looked like anything but soup).
The meat was in a solid blook;
Ot some grief-wasted cow a part;
But when the diner saw the " duff,"
That cruel slab quite broke bis heart!
•* Starvation stares me in the face 1
Alack, oh, woe is me ! ” he cried;
Then killed the waiter with the " duff,”
And drank the soup himself, and died.

The Mayor of Glen Innes is a carious fellow.
He has evidently neglected no opportunity of improving
himself, and a letter he recently wrote to the Glen
Innes Whateveritis, declining the Vice-Presidentship
of the Glen Innes band, is really a capital paraphrase of
some of our best band pars. He concludes the
question lin these terms: "Gentlemen, should you
again desire to elect me to any office in your Brass
Band, let it be forty-eight hours after my death—then,
should your harmonious sounds overtake me, it will Le
on account ot laziness on my part.” This letter has set
the town in arms. The papers up there have been
teeming with “ scathing replies,” and a Glen Innesite,
with a propensity for " dropping into poetry," has for-
warded us a poem on the subject, which he seemingly
desires us to father. We prefer, however, letting him
crush Mr. Mayor Joneslon his own account. Here is
some of what be sings:—
“ When people hold their notions high
But find results are low,
How very indiscreet of them
Their bilious thoughts to show.”
This is cutting, in the extreme, and may be said to
possess at once the withering satire of the Pastor’s
Ode, and the scathing sarcasm of that bitter phillipio
by Dr. Watts, commencing—
" Dogs delight to bark and bite,
For’tis their nature to.”
But when the Mayor, in his letter, taunts the musicians
by stating that " the first essen-
tial qualification” for the vice-
presidentship of the band he
considers to be deafness, the
band retorts that Mr. Jones
would not have held the same
views had the presidentship been
offered to him instead of to the
Police Magistrate. We can’t see,
ourselves, what in Lhe name of
the big drum a brass band wants
with either of these officers. What
are their powers F Can they re-
strain the ardour of the cornet,
or kill the refractory bassoon?
Anyhow, the Glen Innes boys
hold other opinions. The worst
of it is that half the band sides
with the Mayor, and half with
the F.M.; so, therefore, when a
citizen had to be buried with
Masonic honours, the other day,
all the artists that could be mus-
tered were the kettle-drum, the
triangle, and the bassoon. Gloom
is, therefore, upon the musicians,
and they are so dispirited that the
only one to volunteer, so far, to
play for the Church of England
flower show next week is the big
drum. And in the midst of all
this, the French horn openly
stated that should an arrangement
to re-unite bo not speedily come
to, he would proceed at once to
Tenter field and join the band
there; upon which a deputation
of influential citizens waited on
him at his bakery, and informed
him, with tears of joy in their
eyes, that there was no possible
chance of a reconciliation.

A certain suburban parson
hates horses and loves umbrellas.
The other day, a pretty girl tied
her pony to the gate of his pitcl -
pile, and the horse seeing the rev.
gentleman charging towards him
with his umbrella, reared up and
put one of his forefeet through it.
" How dare yon 1" cried the parson
to the young lady, who ap-
proached just as he was extricat-
ing himself—" How dare you
hang your jpony upon my gate?”
" Oh, hang your old gate," re.
torted the young lady— ll What
did you frighten him for ?" Then
looking at him fixedly, she said, with a deep and
penitent tigh: “ Forgive me, reverend sir. You did
not make yourself. It was not your fault. Your
mission on earth is to frighten things. Good day,”,
And she cantered away weeping.

THE FOUR BILLIES OF BURKETOWN.
A MISSIONARY BALLAD.
This is the age of glory, when Religion takes a spurt.
And the ” sugar " of the public goes the niggers to con

A moral time this, surely—as the papers tell you flat—'
When the missionaries prosper and the parsons all grow
fat.
We have the godly Gribble, and the sainted Matthews
too—
Both those halo-headed " grafters " have a lot of work
to do;
And these, and more, to heaven bright are making rapid
tracks,
(And making, too, a little " pile ” converting of the
blacks.)
Well, “ biz." upon the Nicholson was pretty brisk, too

suasion came, *
Were four gigantic niggers- each had Billy for hia
name;
Each «• wore to read his Bible—to forswear all pride and
dross:
The leader had a giant’s foot—they called him “ Bill tha
Boss."
The second, " Bill of Babylon**—a " moniker" sedate
And " Bill the Barker" was the third; the fourth Bill
was his mate.
Oh, the way thev were converted in that moral sauat
ting town!— 1
A treat it was to see them read their Bibles upside
down! *
They were quite truly Christian : they said their littla
prajers;
They P"t off their little Sankeys, and got on their littla
** tears;
They knew alt about the happy land beyond the sky of
And they knew a little bit about the taste of whiskv
too.
At wrestling with the Devil, ev’ry Billy was a “ dab "
And a'‘er throwing Clootie, they would throw at I ankeo

In shore, they soon acquired of accomplishments a lot—
You'd really hardly credit, sirs, how Christian they got.

hastily turning over its pages, he
at length, came to an article illus-

Three purses belonging to three ladies mixing in
mgn-toned Sydney society were recently found in a cer-

another, a florin, the address of a fortune-teller, and a
bus number; and, in the third, threepence and a tram-

tained the following advertisment out from a contem-

At a certain Surry Hills church, prayer for rain
was made on Thursday week. But they had previously
arranged for a Sunday-school picnic on the following
Tuesday. The rain came on Saturday afternoon, so
they prayed Saturday night that it might ba fine on
Tuesday. However, as they weren’t altogether con-
fluent about the result of their prayers, they put the
picnic off. Now, the question is, if all the schools of
the colony were to have a picnic on different days, and
each were to pray for fine weather, when could we ex-
pect rain ? Here’s a poser for the parsons.

The D.T., of course, took Sir Henry’s part in
re the Waterloo library discussion. After declaring
that nothing is se calculated to stimulate the minds of
youth to heroic deeds as narrative of travel, the D.T.
asks : What is more Instructive than a perusal of
the works of such eminent travellers as Baker, Living,
stone, Du Chaillu, Stanley, and Captain Mayne Reid ?”
The latter gentleman once spent six months in Mexico,
but the only " eminent travel ” he ever did was to
“ hook it ’’ for about seven miles from a lot of prowling
Indians, who were seized with a laudable desire to
chase him and cut his hair off. Mayne Reid writes
about the noble redskin just as “our London corres-

We are white-faced and nerveless, and are going
out for a revivifler. We are unstrung and prostrated,
for we have seen J. C. Layoock’s national anthem in
the Manning Times. We will sample it fairly—it’s
called “ Australia." Here’s the opening—
“ Oh! what of the past of this wonderful country
Arising like magic from barbarity ;
Unfolding wings with surprising dexterity,
Unshackled, flees from idolatry.”
Here’s the middle—
“ Oh 1 where now the sables that ruled this terra
firma.
Gone as forerunners to the few left behind ;
Gone to the shades in silence and murmur.
Gone to tbe death with the lame and ihe blind."
And this—pull yourself together, and get a firm grip o*
your under lip—this is the end—
" Progressive men are thy sonllers and cricketers.
Boldly they traverse the wild raging sea ;
Bravely contend against all competitors.
Again and again successfully.
Unfurl the flag, and peiform thy grand functions,
Under civilised man, thou shalt prosperous be;
Developed resources, scientific oonjunctions,
Shall make thee, Australia, great, glorious, and
free.”
Poet Layoock, we understand, ia related to Sculler
Layoock. We hope that Poet Layoock doesn’t often
have anew brew. Wo have read a chunk of him before.
Some poets are always the same—sublime in their pro-
fundity, jolting rhymleasue-s, discordant verbiage, and
scientific sanjunotivatiou But it’s not so with Poet
Layoock, who will be a perfect bard when he gets his
Pegasus shod with kerosene tins.

Draw her to him, and saw his strong love vented
In several maniac ways—then eat, contented.,
XLIX,
The old, old story, told in every nation,
The new sweet tale of many a vanished age.
The subject of so much prevarication.
The theme of mmy a brightly-jewelled page;
The joy of palaces, nnd of back-block station ;
Life’s fairest, brightest, richest heritage.
O Giant Love —the Archimedean lever
That moves the universe, and will for ever.
L.
Here, for a moment, I will ask your pardon.
Eight her* I’m going to stop and moralise
On things that would have been extremely bard on
This world of ours—great strange calamities.
Compared to which the Serpent in tbe Garden
Would be as cheerful as the annual prize
They give in Sabbath Schools, which in most oases
Lays bare the general goings-on in Blazes.
LI.
I’m going to show you, my young friends, concisely.
That Love has mada Ibis world a big success—
Has palled as throagb, and brought us very nicely
Out ot what might have been a serious mess;
That Love’s a mechanism provided wisely
To save the world from barren emptiness :
And, after doing so. I’ll instance briefly
The things we have to thank the Lord for chiefly.
Lit,
End primal Adam not gone straight for Eve, as
Soon as the Lord had turned her out complete.
And mentioned to her that he’d die as lief as
Leave her again, in an oration neat —
Or, had their honeymoon been cut as brief as
We have ’em now—extremely short and sweet—
A nine days’ picnic, then a general scramble
About the debts—d’ye hear me, Peter Campbell ?
tin.
Or, had they studied “ Mill on Population,”
And fonnd the world had not sufficient food
To keep the full increase of every nation
In bare necessities of livelihood—
Tbe chances are that, upon meditation.
Eve yet had been unwedded and unwooed;
And, only meeting Adam when at table.
Had ne’er made us the sons of Cain or Abel.
LIV.
This would have proved for us a sad dilemma.
For then we shouldn’t have been bom at all—
A state of matters I would much condemn, a
Concatenation of woes great and small:
Like ’Eaery’s literary work Whoa, Emma 1
Just here I’d better do a gentle crawl.
I think at Polities his bead’s on level.
But be can keep bis “ Marmara” for the devil.
LV.
Ergo, they never could have put Q serve Day in
The House to represent tbe far-off Hume;
He would have had no sunshine to make hay in—
We would have had no M'Elhonian broom.
The pious Crows would have no world to prey in.
And bnsiness here would not have been a boom
Enabling them to grab as big a cheque as
The late lamented Reverend Doctor Baokbaus.
LVI.
Nigh half a'million we would not have lost on
The Garden Palace; and the Fancy Fay res
The angel’s aching hand had not engrossed on
The endless catalogue of saored snares ;
Joe Cook would not have crossed the Pond from Boston
To beard the Doubters in their very lairs
(T’ve heard it said, or read it in a book,
God sends the food—the Devil sends the Cook).
L^II.
M’Beath could never have attained the glory
Which is his own peculiar attribute;
Tom Garrett never wenld have lived in story j
O’Farrell never would have tried to shoot
His Grace ; Sir ’Enery had not been a hoary
Old Yah ! I’m not such a complete galoot
Had Adam been a local preacher, can
You tell us how we’d got our “ Grand Old Man ?”
LVIII.
John Pioneer wouldn’t have got off with no rope,
And neither would a large per-oentage more
(You’ll know who they are when you get a tow-rope,
And drag their names from me, bnt not before);
John Henniker would not have been in Europe,
Creating such a most condemned furore;
Lord Loftua never would have had a, Brahma,
Nor Porkes beheld the Spectre of Kiama.
LIX.
There wouldn’t have been much to live for : even
The Freeman's Journal had not been, to guide
My countrymen to an exclusive Heave*
Of Irish Patriots, quite “fall inside; ”
And all the magic cures of Milner Stephen
Had not come off, and people might have died
As they—my libellous old Muse, be steady—
I nearly wrote '* As they have died already."
LX.
No Ministry would v e; no Opposition ;
No Chairman of Directors, and no chair;
No need for acid Elders to petition;
No Sunday trains to start for anywhere;
Our streets and parks would be above suspicion—
No sinful creatures would assemble there;
And vet another mast suggestive fact is—
There would have been no ten o’clock choir practice.
LXI.
There would have been—the' bought is toe distressing
—No We-leyan Churoh, to uraise eternal Hell;
No Parish Priest, to give his flook a dressing;
No Standard and no Bathurst Sentinel.
But, there—it’s really past all human guessing
What mivht have happened—and we might as wall
Guess whether Davies has his little failings.
Or what he parted for those iron railings.
LXII.
Or whether Pastor Allen and Parnassus
Will come together as the ages roll;
Or whether Eli Johnson takes his glass, as
Most people will, at times, from pole to pole;
Or what would be about the coin, in Masses,
Required to rescue my ill-fated soul
From ont the miseries of Purgatory,
And fit it with a cash-down Crown of Glory ?
(To be continued.)
DENOMINATIONAL DROPS.
Prayers for rain! Wby, had Nature,
instead of obeying her own laws, listened to the prepos-
terous demands of the clergy, this fair earth of ours
would have collapsed long ago like a balloon with a bole
in it.
“Trouble at St. Paul’s Church, Burwood. Parson
and surpliced choir v. the ohnroh wardens. The termer
want to process in acolyte order; the latter don't see
it. They say that the donning of the surplices has by
one family been made the pretext for ceasing to drop
their three-pence 3 ia the plate, and that should the
procession business be allowed, other families may
follow suit. To process or not to process is still a
vexed question,
Joe Cook, the “ Rev.,” who admits that he is
“not n clergyman," on arriving in Sin Francisco from
the Eastern States, en route to Australia, opened bis
show in 'Frisco, and as Joseph always takes care to bo
well billed, the reporters were sent by all the journals
to see him through. When the lecture opened, there
were two large tables surrounded bv reporters, pencil
in hand, and ready to *‘ wire in " Five minutes after
Joseph com n enced what the Sydney Mousing Mission-
ary terms his " unant werable arguments," everyone
of these reporters had laid down his pencil. Farce of
oratory F Well, perhaps so But nexc morning not a
siogli newspaper in 'Frisco had any more reference to
the Rev. Joe Cook than if he had never been born. He
probably wished he never had been.
The Roman Catholic Archbishop Purcell of
Cincmnatti has “ bast up,” financially speaking. He
has become insolvent, with debts amounting to about
£8)0,000; and the assignee having petitioned for leave
to sell the Archbishop’s estate, there is an extremely
hot kettle of fish. All the lands upon which churches,
schools, seminaries, and so forth, stand are deeded in
the name of the Archbishop, and are included in the
1 raperties which the assignee wants to sell. The priests
ot each diocese have all engaged attorneys to resist the
sales, claiming tba r - the congregations, having con-
tributed to buy and improve the properties, have rights
outside the Archbishop’s interest and title. Then,
again, each of about 150 congregations and societies
have engaged attorneys to co-operate with the priests’
lawyers, and nearly every oae of the creditors has
retained a special attorney. Consequently, every law-
yer in Cincinnatti is “ iu it" up to the neck ; and if tbe
blessings of lawyers were net invariably mistaken for
curses at tbe Throne cf Grace, Archbishop Purcell
would go to Elysium by a special express chariot of lire
the very instant he breathes Lis last.
Palmer Law, pastor of the Ocean-street Con-
gregational Church, Wooilahra, is ths editor of a series
of interacting tracts, styled "The Australian Leaflet."
The pastor's style is orientally metaphorical. Hs tays:
—*• Ba more anxious to furnish thy heart than thy
honse. The love of Jesus in thy breast is better than a
hundred-guinei piano in thy drawing room.” This
question entirely .closes up the fact that even a pastor
sometimes furnishes a now house. Wo learn also that
“ sympathy is the rainbow of God’s love arching onr
sorrows,” while “ prayer is a glass into whieh God
pours the wine of heaven.” A *• hasty temper” is
“ worse than a bear in thy house,” says Law, and as wa
never kept any bears around onr kennel, we can’t dig-
pute the assertion flatly, though we take it with salt.
We are told that “to succeed in winning souls the
heart must be on fire.” Then Gehenna most be the
most successful missionary station we have heard of.
This advice is tendered to smokers: “ Give thy to-
bacco pipe to God, and lay the money that it consumes
upon his altar.” We don’t consume money ia onr
pipe—we cadge; so wo can’t very well grip on to this:
suggestion. The last command of the tract is—'* Drop
me by the wayside.” We cheerfully obey.
The following circular has been forwarded by
the Very Rev. the Vicar-General to the clergy of the
Sydney Diocese, Church of England:—“Eev. and Dear
Hr, Feeling persuaded that there will be a general
desire throughout the dioJese to offer our special
thanksgiving to Almighty God for His gracioni answer
t i our prayers by sending ns rain to relieve onr neces-
sities, I write to request you to invite yonr parishioners
to join in thanksgiving on Sunday, the sth Novem-
ber. A short form of thanksgiving will be forwarded to
yon in a few days, which may be med with the Sunday
service. It would seem to me desirable that, at tho
same time, Ihe congregation should be Invited to show
thair thankfulness by special offerings, for some paro-
chial or diocesan object, of whieh notice might be
given on Sunday next." So the medium men of the
Anglican Churoh, having worked their rain-miraclo
trick, are abent to send round the hat, “ Diocesan or
parochial object” is gaod. The clergy ask their
followers to pay them for what they have done. They
had better beware lest the cor gregarious stick to this
new at stem of payment by results and in future decline
to pay their rain dervishes unless they have done some-
thing
London Truth says, of a sermon at St. Paul’s :
*• A well known Canon got up and delivered one of
those extremely orthodox and depressing sermons which
make some people close their eyes, and others mb them
in apathy or despair. To hear a venerable, gray-haired
scholar still treating Adam and Eve as historical person-
ages, was indeed wonderful, and most of us, I think,
felt a little shy and awkward at being caught listening
to snob nonsense ; but when tho learned Canon
announced that the Christian religion was not intended
to make na comfortable here, or happy hereafter, but
only to moke us holy, I gave him up. Neither the
student of history nor the man of the world will sit
patiently under such a style of pr«aching. Tbe sooner
the clergy are told flatly by the laity that this sort ot
thing will no longer do, the better The mediaeval
theologians were creators: their successors arc only
parrots, and continue a system wbich the age has out-
grown. They are brought up on old text-books, cram
IhamseDes with false theories, and teach Sunday after
Sunday from tbe pulpit what grown-up people won’t,
believe, and intelligent parents are ashamed to teach
their children. They are dignitaries who enjoy large
emoluments, live rent-free iu snug houses with good
cellars, and explain to those not exposed to temptation,
tbe beauty ot self-saorifiae, the folly of ease, and tbe
gospel ot holy miso.y.”
Here is indeed a “ blessed thort.” We are
doing quite a heap for the heathen. At Onitsba, near
Sierra Leone, two young girls sinfully bolted away
from the service of two missionaries, named Fortnnatua
John, and John Williams. Fortunately, however,
Portunatus ran them down, and then tbe worthy elders
began to exhort the culprits. First of all, the girls
were stripped naked; tied back to back, and then
flagged with pine sticks, the monotony of tho enter
tainment being occasionally relieved by doses cf ca '

WOMAN ITEMS.
A giddy young girl was Christina Jansen, aged
16, of Wellington, N.Z, She had a “ chap,” and nur-
tured a wild idea that if the said “ chap” could be per-
suaded he was a father, she would bo happy, to she
went to the ” Friendless Woman’s Home," Wellington,
and obtained a young baby. But the “chap was too
“ fly," and wouldn’t take the lively interest in the babe
he was expected to. The child took ill—because it bad
no nourisUment. Christina took cress, put the child in
a box and let it die. Tbe coroner told Christina at tbe
inquest that, the only reason she was not committed for
manslaughter was because tbe child had died more in
consequence of her ignorance how to tend it, than from
intentional neglect. So the little comedy ended in a
tragedy.

Mr. Thos. H. Boyd, American Vice-Consul.
We give, on page 8, a portrait of Mr. Thomas H.
Boyd, Vice-Consul for the United States, and the
well-known artist photographer of this city. A
few months ago, in recognition of his services as
an American citizen, and, doubtless, of the aid he
had lent to the encouragement of his art in this
colony, Mr. Boyd was nominated to the position
of Vice-Consul by Mr. Kahlo, the Consul-General
for Australia. Few men have done more to
cement friendly feeling and foster trade relations
between these colonies and the United States than
Mr. Boyd. In this direction there has been a
complete change during the last three years to the
decided advantage of the two countries. The
honour that has been conferred on him has thus
been well deserved. I;-i respect, however, of his
connection with art, Mr. Boyd has principally
made his name known throughout Australasia. He
came out to N.S.W. about three years ago. Prior
to that he was one of the firm of photographers,
Boyd and Taber, of San Francisco, whose pro-
ductions earned for that city the highest
reputation for photography. When Mr. Boyd
came to Sydney he needed no introduction. His
artistic productions were already here. Advanced
as photography undoubtedly was in this city at the
time, Mr. Boyd’s works awakened fresh interest.
His style found feeble imitators all over the
colonies; and where artistic ability failed, hia
style of signature both on card and envelope has
been copied with the most flattering fidelity.
Nothing, however, can detract from the merit
which Mr. Boyd has won for his works, and his
studio every day gives fresh proof of the fact. At
his recent anniversary, Mr. Boyd had an exhibi-
tion of his works, and it was largely attended by
all the connoisseurs of art in the city. The ex-
hibits of all descriptions of photography, but par-
ticularly of the life-size portraits in oils, water
colours, and crayons, for which there is a greatly
increasing taste, were pronounced equal to any-
thing produced in the world. Mr. Boyd’s success
in this city is a line that ought not be without
good result among other enterprising artists and
business men abroad The field for success is
here, —all that is wanted is ability, capital, and
enterprise.
It i<j the man with a swelled jaw who realizes
that silence is golden.
There is mourning l in the back-blocks, and the
bush shanty-keepers refuse to be comforted. The old
ordsr is passing away, and giving place to the new. The
railways, which suable men to get speedily into Sydney,
are doing it. Now-a-davs the shearers, instsad of
“melting their cheques’* at the nearest put., pass
right by it as it they were the blackest etrangeaa, and
carry their money home to their wives and families.
This is a standing disgrace to t Li country, end merit*
the strongest reprobation, Wa have it on good authority
that some of the shanty-keepers have been reduced to
such a state of destitution in consequence of this heart-
less oonduot that they have been ouliged to enter tbe
Church or edit religions papers to keep themselves out
of absolute penary. A subscription for these distressed
people has been started at this office, subscriptions
may take the form ef bricks, angle ir>n% dead cits,
copies of the Tribune, or whatever suits the donor's
fancy.
THE GAY FIREMAN.
Who wears a uniform s* gay.
At demonstrations to display.
Bat yet, when wanted, i: away?
Tho Fireman.
Who bawls and yells and shouts and cries.
As to a fire his waggon flies.
And acts the fool before all eyes ?
The Fireman.
Who rushes like a boy at school.
Instead of manlike keeping cool.
And generally plays the fool ?
The Fireman.
Who carries in untidy style
A tomahawk that needs a fi'e.
To make the carrying worth his while P
The Fireman.
Who clumsily his hose connects,
And stupidly the branch directs,
Which not at all the flame affoms ?
Tho Fireman.
Who, in his zeal to bo of use.
Curses with tongue loth loud and loose.
And proves a " demon”—at ?
The Fireman.
Who skites like any bragging lout
Of (ires that could be put out
la half the time—were he about ?
The Fireman.
Who is it outs his rival’s hose,
When to a fire the rascal goes.
And of his vicious mischief blows ?
The Fireman.
Who at a fire goes raving mad ?
Who, of the various forms of cad.
Is most particularly bad ?
Tho Fireman,
How they didn’t beat the Favourits,
A LAY OF THE VICTORIAN DERBY,
1882.
[A LONG WAT AFIER GORDON.]
You who can’t be in Melbourne, your chagrin is well-
torne
At missing the Bace-week by reading it up ;
You can lighten your troubles by *• sweepstakes ” and
“ doubles,”
Or backing yonr fancies for Derby and Cup.
Eighty-two's Derby’s over, and all are in clover
Who’d the boldness to back Navigator and Hales :
He’s a jock of rare kidney, a credit to *ydnev !
Wortn a pile to DeMestre and New South Wales.
But it needs a spectator to give Navigator
The kudos that’s due to his fine form, to-day:
In mere press men to trust is to do an injustice
To such a grand horse.—iso come list to my lay.
At evens he started—nor yet broken hearted
Were Segeuhoe’s backers at seven to two;
While Guesswork had cronies with ‘thou.’s’ on and
ponies.
Who swore, if he only would go, he would do.
A fairly quiet lot soon, at signal from Watson,
Eaced clattering off to a very good start:
The fav’rite with Guesswoik and Boolka made less
work
Of getting up steam—from the ruck well apart.
But the gap was soon shorter. Transferred, at the
Water,
Passed Boolka, with Aide-de-Camp close on his flank ;
Then we all looked at Murphy, as nigh to the turf he
Came, —Segeuhoe tripping and losing his rank.
Guesswork and Transferred are now leading the third, a
Good half-dozen lengths of daylight between.
A fast race : and hotter the pace grew, to totter
Behind in the tear soon poor Oalma was seen.
So terrific the pace is, a shifting of places
Soon followed; and Segenhoe with Pryingpan
Now took up the running, while Hales with great cun-
ning,
Gave a poll to work well out his preconceived plan.
Bound the corner together they swept on : but whether
The orange or blue cap led, none could decide—
Even with glasses’ assistance, we could at tho distance
But see them locked level, and go stride for stride.
Oh 1 the shouts and the cheering I the hoping and fear-
ing 1
The " Stand " all on tiptoe I Cheeks flushed and eyes
blurred I
“ Now Segenhoe’s leading 1” “ Now Fryingpan’a speed-
ing
Up to him again 1” How they whipped 1 how they
spurred!
On together they thundered; tho surging crowd won-
dered
To see how the pair kept their furious pace.
Some still cried “ Navigator I’’ “If he lags much
later.
He’ll barely succeed in obtaining a place I ”
Bat Hales didn’t want telling—’mid cheering and yell-
. mg.
With a grandly-timed rush, he shot up to the pair:
He challenged and raced them, and fairly outpaced
them,
And won with a length and a quarter to spare 1
The S. M. Herald office is being fitted with
theeiectic light.
The Andersens, of “Industrial College'* renown,
say there going to start another “ institution.”
S’posea ’possum is up a tree, a man on the
ground wants to shoot it, and the ’possum persists in
keeping on tbe opposite side of the tree. Well, s’;ose
the man wa ka clear round the tree, the ’possum alt the
time goirg lound on the opposite side— haa the man
been round Ihe 'possum ? Of murke, be haa been round
the tree with the ’possum on it; but that’s not the
question. Has he walked round tho ’possum ?

In consequence of the tempestuous weather on
Saturday, tne opening cruise of the Prince Alfred

Every effort is to be made to induce the Sydney
contingent of the Australian Eleven to take part in the
first match, Sydney v. Bligh’s team.
Hon. James White and family arrived at Mel-
bourne on Monday, by the Austral. Fordham, the
English jockey, was not amongst the passengers.
“ Pendragon” says that anyone who had seen
the Hillsdale crew in their practice in England tyould
have acquitted the English amateurs of the charge of
being afraid to meet them.
Mr. W. S. Crawford performed at the last New-
market meeting the hitherto unparalleled performance
of winning the Casare witch, the Middle Park Plate, and
Champion Stakes of 1000 sovs. in one fell swoop as it
were.
A 100 yards’ race for .£2O a side took place on
the Military Boad, North Shore, on the 21st October,
between G. James and C. Thomson. The latter got away
at the start, but James soon overtook him, and even-
tually won by a yard.
England gave the States two severe dressings
lately—both within a fortnight of one another. The
American marksmen were badly beaten at Creedmoor,
and the Thames Amateurs showed the Hillsdale crew
the way to the winning post.
■James H. Eiley, who, our readers will remember,
was beaten by Laycock in England two years ago, won
a two-mile sculling race on Kenka Lake, Hammonds-
port. New York, on July 27 j and rowed second to
George Lee, in a three-mile race at the same place, on
August 2.
Joseph Henry, a Carlton (Yic.) footballer, has
been seriously ill, but is now recovering. During his
illness, the Melbourne F.C. sent him £lO, the South
Melbourne F.C. £5, and the Carlton F.C., to which he
belonged His old foes put their hands in their
pockets, his friends forgot him altogether.
The Hercules Amateur Dramatic Company have
challenged the Theatre Boyal company to another
friendly gam • of cricket, on Norwood Park, on 9th
November, 'ine Theatre Boyal team will be elected
from the following leviathans: Williamson, Musgrove,
Verdi, Woodfleld, Eobson, Beaumont, Ford, Green
Porthwick, Hamilton, Johnson, and Atkinson.
There was not a quorum at the meeting called
on Monday night to make arrangements for the reoep-
tien of the Australian cricketers. The Eleven are to be
banqueted. ;The Australians want to play Bligh's team
in November, at Sydney, but the Melbourne O C. do not
wish to see their proteges licked so early in (heir
colonial career, and will not accede to the Australians’
request.
Notwithstanding the unfavourable, stormy
weather, John Laycock and 8. Edwards rowed their
race in light skiffs over the champion course on Satur-
day. Laycock won easily; but in consequence of a dis-
pute as to the boat in which he rowed, the stakes (£5O)
were not paid over on Saturday evening. The
steamer Swansea, with about a score of persona on
board, followed the race.
Dick Turpin’s famous ride from London to York
has been done lately by a bicyclist. Mr. H. L. Eeynolds
tbe winner of the B. C. Bath race, started from
Eegent’s Park at 12 midnight on 29th June, and reached
York at 10.43 next night. The distance is 1991 miles,
and the state of the Yorkshire roads is described as
awful. In spite, however, of Mr. Eeynolds’ exertions,
he rode 77 miles next day, and 80 the day after.
An inquest was held in Sheffield on 23rd Aug.
on the body cf Thomas Billam, aged 17, who had died
through injuries received in a cricket field. While
Plying in a match at Damall early In August, he was
struck on the knee by a ball, and a week afterwards
showed symptoms of blood-poisoning, from which he
died last Sunday. Medical evidence showed there was
ho trace of disease except blood poisoning from a blow.
The N.S.W. National Regatta on 2Cth January
is to be a “hummer,’* Mr. J. P. Gar van, M.P., has
been appointed hon. treasurer, and C. C. Metcalf and
A. Green, joint hon. secretaries. The following are the
committee Messrs. E. W. Knox, C. C. Medcalf, J. P.
Qarvan, H. Eich, A. Green, J. E. Drewett, V. Brown,
H. Underwood, W. Grant, H. A. Fitzpatrick, P. E.
Williams, F. A. Wright, Dr. Milford, H. Milson, and
others.
In addition to Dayin accomplishing a high ump
r - J’ Parsons, of Edinburgh University,
holds two undoubted records of 6tt jumps, one at the
West of Scotland sports, and one at the Glasgow
Academical sports. Both theso records were made in
1881. Mr. Parsons won the championship in the high
jump at Lillie Bridge in 1880, with a jump of sft 9fin in
bad weather, and he has several records of, sft 10m and
sft llin.
“Pendragon” says we patronised Trickett on
his return here. Speaking of Sir John Eobertson's
speech, he says: "I don’t know who Eobertson is,
beside* being a knight (ho is called Sir John), but he
must be in great danger of exploding with his own
importance. He said, *lf Trickett had come back a
winner, I would not have been here,’ and he said many
another thing which must have made Trickett, who,-
with all his faults, does not need to be sat upon so
heavily by those who have elected to be his friends for
the time being, feel extremely uncomfortable.’’
The promoters of the six days’ bicycle contest
have not been in luck’s way. The wet weather during
the we«k prevented large attendances. The contest
was remarkably good; Irish led up to the last day, when
Eolfe caught him and eventually won. The distances
covered were as followEolfe, 909 miles ; Irish, 908
miles 8 laps; Mitchell, 903 miles 3 laps; Hoskins, 740
miles 9 laps; Thorley, 733 miles 9 laps; Hourigan, 597
miles llap; Watson, 173 miles. Where was Press, who
won in Victoria, who was advertised to race here, but
who didn’t ? No apology appeared for him.
The first race of the Prince Alfred Yacht Club
for the season will come oil on 12th November, and
there will be a general handicap ; first prize, Commo-
dore Want’s trophy; seaond prize, £10; third prize,
£5; the second prize to go f > tue first boat of a diderent
class to the winner of the first prize, third prize to be
fiven to the first boat of either of the remaining classes,
he classification of yachts for this season is as follows :
—First-class, over twelve tons; second-class, 12 tons
and over 8 tons; third-class, 8 tons and under; fourth-
class, half-decked j achts. All centreboard yachts to
sail with fast centreboards.
The Rose Hill Bowling Club are making a
thing of beauty and a joy for ever” of the piece of
ground granted to them from the Parramatta Park.
They have made it the largest bowling-green in the
colony—l44ft. by 12)ft. Ac one end a pavilion is
to be ereoied, and close by a skittle-alley and gym-
nasium, At the other end two tennis courts and a
croquet ground are to be laid out. At one side a
quoit ground is to be prepared. The green has been
so constructed that in one way seven rinks can be
played, and in the other six rinks. The ground was
formally opened on 25th October, when the president
of the club, Mr. E. Harper, was presented with a hand-
some set of bowls inlaid with silver.
The arrangements for the public reception of
the Australian Eleven in Melbourne are, to say the least,
extensive. The team are to be met at the Spencer-
street station by the Cricket Association, and then
driven to the Town Hall, where they will be received
and welcomed back to the city by the Mayor. In the
evening they will be driven from their hotel and
accompanied by a firemen’s torchlight procession and
bands to the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which will bo
illuminated by the electric light, and a pyro-
technic display will take place; at half.past 9 the
team will be entertained at a banquet in the Town Hall.
A special medal is to be presented to each member of
the team. This is carrying things right out—only if
another Prince comes to see us, we won’t know what to
do to strike a difference.
The programme for the Separation Day Regatta
at Brisbane comprises 13 events, including the amateur
sculling race for the Coolalta Cup, and the intercolonial
champion fours for £lOO. The prize will be £5O if there
be only Queensland entries. Now, why don’t one of our
rowing clubs, or the N.S.W. Bowing Association, send
a four to Brisbane P When we have any prize of the
kind here we consider we are slighted it the other
colonies are not represented in the contests. Bowing
has been a big boom up North for some time, and we
shall not be surprised if the Brisbane crew show our
four the way over the course. Intercolonial contests
will give a greater impetus to rowing than such pot-
hunting exhibitions as we had the annoyance of wit-
nessing on the Parramatta Eiver on the occasion of the
last Association Eegatta.
A Flemington fact. Mr. I. Laye, seeing his old
friend Mr. Sopthead, from Eiverina, doing the Stand,
gives him a most warm and friendly welcome, after
which he points to a brother metalliciaa and earnestly
whispers: “ Shee dat feller mit de white hat, veil dat
vash Hiram Hawke yon has nothing to do mit him.
’Shelp me Gott he vould stheal the lid off hi* own
mother’s coffin." An hour later Hiram meets Sopthead
also; the result being another enthusiastic greeting,
and as the pair brush past Mr. Laye, Mr. Hawke contt-
dently observes: “ You keeps avay from dot sohamp
Laye so much vat you can ; he’s der damdest scoundrel
vat efer lives.” And when the settling-up is over,
Messrs Isaac and Hiram clink their goblets and drink,
many happy returns of these days—and dupes. A fellow
who backed Sweet William sent us this.
Hanlan, we now hear, is not afraid to row
Wallace Boss, as many persona supposed. The cham-
pion but recently recovered from a severe attack of
sickness, which compelled him to break off his match.
Since, he has been advised by eminent physicians to
rest and not engage in any race this season, predicting
that the strain would result in his permanent injury.
Hanlan to show that he was not afraid of Boss, wrote
“Toronto, August 23rd, 1882.|1n answer to Wallace E oss’
challenge to row me for the championship, I nave
thoroughly made up my mind not to row any race this
year, and therefore cannot accommodate Mr. Boss,
who seems to bo so eager to wrest the championship
from me. But I hereby make him an offer. I will
consent to row him four or five miles on any course
between here and New York next June for $5OOO aside
and the championship of the world. If Mr. Boss does
not embrace this opportunity for making a match,
there is every probability that I will not be able to
accommodate him with a race even next year. I may
be engaged in business which will prevent me making
any matches unless I have long notice ahead. If he
entertains this proposition he can send along articles
of agreement.— Edward Hanlan.” Later, advices,
ho wever, state that the pair are to row shortly.

The following were appointed selection committee-
Messrs. John Forsyth, Andrew Peyton, and T.
E. Allt. The City Club were presented by
Mr. John Young with his handsome trophy. It
takes the form of a pedestal of ebony about 14
inches high, and ornamented with silver flowers and
fem leaves. On the top of the pedestal is a solid silver
base upon which is the silver figure of a bowler standing
at ease with a bowl in his hand. The trophy is to be
won three times consecutively by any one club before
it becomes i hat club s property, or if one club wins it
five times in the competition is becomes the property
of that club. Mr. John Forsyth was presented with
the champion medal for highest score in the competi-
tions.
The Flemington racecourse was largely attended
on Saturday, the opening day of the V E G, meeting.
Owing t* the recent death of the Dowager Marchioness
of Normanby, the Governor of Victoria was not
present. The weather was cold and windy, but the
course was in splendid order. Many improvements
had been made, and Flemington never looked to better
advantage. Darebin was made a big favourite for the
Melbourne Stakes. He made most of the running and
wonia something like a canter irom Belmont and
Larpent, who were second and third. Sting ran with
light plates on, and was never in it. When he returned
to the paddock a small stream cf blood was seen coming
from his nostrils. Albyn and First Water were backed
heavily for the Hotham Handicap, but Odd Trick won
rather easily by a length from Sardonyx, who ran a
great race with Commotion for second place, the former
gaining it by half a length. Twenty-six started for the
Maribyrnong Plate, and Narina justified public expecta-
tion by winning by three-quarters of a length ; Kings,
dale running a good second, and Laly Jervois third.
Ten went to the post for the Derby; Navigator being
favourite at even money. Guesswork and Transferred
took the lead and made the pace a cracker for a mile
and a quarter, when they cried a “go." Fryingpan
made a great race up the straight, but in the last 100
yards Navigator came up on the outside and won by a
length and a quarter in the retr arkably fast time of 2 min.
•lljseo., which is Guesswork’s Derby time at Adelaide,
and beats the best English record by a second and a
half. Fryingpan beat Segenhoe for second place by
half a length. The latter stumbled when rounding the
river turn, whereby he must have lost five or six
lengths. Sylvanus, Qostwyck, and Essendon started for
the Essendon Stakes; Sylvanus, who was ridden by
Hales, won) comfortaoly in 3 min. Twenty-six
started for the Coburg Stakes, Tyropean and Plunger
being the favourites, but the winner turned up in
Wizard, who ran through his horses and won easily by
two lengths; Master Avenel beating Verdure for second
place by a neck. The victories of Navigator and Narina
must be a severe blow to the ring. Nearly every Cup
horse was written with Navigator, but as the ring has
had some throws in for the last two seasons, it is time
the public had an innings of good luck—better luck
than the result of this year’s Melbourne Cup has
brought them. The Darby was the best contested race
for many seasons, and the running for the Maribyrnong
Plate promises open races for the next Sydney and Mel-
bourne Blue Ribbons.

The second day’s racing at Fleming'
ton was satisfactory—to the ring. Belmont
was fl-st for the Maiden Plate; Boolka won
tne Kailway Stakes rather easily. _ In the Kensing-
ton Sinker, Lady Jervois sailed in six lengths ahead of
everything. Tne Cup was a fluke. It was run In mud
and rain. The Assyrian was first, Stookwell second,
Gudara third, and the time—3 40 A skinner for most
of tha boeks, and the biggest boil-over on record.
Essex appropriated the Dining Stakes, and Bagot won
the Yan Yean Stakes by two lengths. Assyrian, whose
lacky owner is understood to be no less a personage
than Mr. James Allison, of theatrical notoriety, was
heavily banked for the Caulfield Cup, and people now
wonder why he didn’t win. Sweet William, we hear,
was backed for £70.000 right out, and for £20,000

syndicate, familiarly known as “ the happy band.”

The plain and fancy ball given to aid the
Inverell Hospital was a good aaoeesa, though there
were not many fancy dresses. First, was the Hungarian
Lady, Mrs. Mayne, wearing a rich dress of cardinal and
grey satin, trimmed with grey fur, and a pretty cap
with silver tassels, considering her the belle.
Mist M'tiregor, as a Fishwife, looked the character
capitally. Miss Walker, as Arline, wore a bright satin
dress trimmed with gold braid and sequins, tambourine,
&o.,complete. Mr. Finlayson wasa Jack Tar, andafavor-
Pe. The Neapolitan Fisherman looked and danced well.
Among the pretty evening toilets, Mrs. Knowles wore a
rich white satin; Miss Cruiekshatk, a pink silk; Mrs.
P Campbell, pink silk ; but the gem was a pale blue

Mrs. Plumay. About £6O waa realised for the hospital.

Some 400 guests attended the annual Hospital
Ball, at Melbourne, last week, in the Town Hail, so
there waa plenty of room. Among the belles of the
evening, several Sydney ladies wera prominent. Mias
Levey wore n handsome heliotrope satin dress, with
trimmings of cream Spanish lace, lilies and leaves.
Mrs. Charles Jacobs was attired in rich black silk, and
Miss Belle Weaver was observed to weave *er spell of
fascination over the Southern youth in oostly cream.
Herr Flock’s band gave the music, and that pretty
tinkle, The Bulletin polka (composed in Melbourne),
was one of their nicest tunes.

A Jewish wedding in the Great Synagogue, has
at all times sufficient charm to attract many of the
fair, but- t.be event of Wednesday, the 25th October,
seemed to be haloed with unusual interest. For the fair
bride was a Woollahra belle (Miss B irr) such as f jw bride-
groomsare nrivilmrod to ring. At 3 p.m., after a harmo-
nium prelude, the Eev A A. Lsvi, attended by tbe bride-
groom ''Mr, Aronson) and his supporters, ascended the
dais, and chanted the attornoon or Mmohi service Atits
conclusion, the Wedding March was played by Mr. C
Huenerbein, and as the music floated through the
magnificent edifice, the bridal party entered. Leading
was the bridegroom, supporting the Uibbi’s w f), who
anted ns his fnon->or. and he appeared to quite under-
stand the responsorbility he was undertaking. The
brine’s mother w»s attired in a pretty costnme of terra
cotta and light straw bonnet. The bride walked d iwn
t,no side resting modestly upon the arm of her father.
To absorb the bridal raiment was, to a practised eye,
bub an instant’s work It was simply perfection, a
marvel of the costumier’s handicraft, composed of a
rich cream satin that harmonised with the dhicite
complexion of the pretty bride, and set off with tu'le
veil and wreath of orange blossom and myrtle. Six
bridesmaids followed, and their attire was a contrast of
pompadour tunics, coarse straw hats edged with roses,
and cream satin skirts, piquant and charming. A
decidedly Spanish type of beanty was robed in a soft
tint of grey snrah, trimmed with brooheof same colour,
Eubens hat in unison. A tall lady from Surry Hills was
clad in well-fitting silken white, with a salmon bonnet.
A compact lady from Bathurst charmed with a neat
brown cashmere and moird, Swedish gloves en suite,
and bonnet of golden brown. A dove-colonred brocaded
satin caught the eye, and a dark damask rose in her
bonnet set off to advantage a young matron from a
harbour suburb. St. Anthony himself could hardly
have kept the tenth commandment, surrounded by such
a store of jewels as glittered on every hand. The
brocaded velvet of a sndwy-haired dowager was enriched
by jewels of rare worth ; and diamonds shone on many a
throat, oar, and finger. Her daughter in-law was in
silk of celestial blue with moonlight trimming ; whilst
c'ose beside her stood a maidonin pale bins, and dainty
bonnet with crystal garniture. The whole scene was
picture=queness, heightened perhaps by a tiny pige in
blaok satin and lace, who acted as train-bearer to the
bride. After the ceremony, the guests assembled to a
well-served dejinner, and at half-past six the married
pair started for Sandringham (thence to Melbourne),
the bride in a pretty travelling garb of grey homesi un,
with light brown hat, and a circlet of roses nestling
around her happy face.

It’s a peculiar fact that one week-day will often
sea more people gathered in a church than a month of
Sundays. From which it is a plain inference that
• Dearly beloved, we ara gathered together," is more
interesting, at any rate to ladies, than “ Dearly beloved
brethren, the Scripture moveth us,” or “ When the
wicked man turneth away from his wickedness” to do
• • that which is lawful and right ” By the way, wo
think that if the marriage servico were to commence
with this latter sentence, there would be, if not appro-
priateness. a good deal of significance about it. How-
ever, last Wednesday week, St. Michael’s was thronged,
and, strange to say, not one person was observed asleep.
Artistic hands had decked the sombre walla and dull
aisles with foliage and choice flowers, making them
almost cheerful; and there was much rustling and
whispering, and peering of eager eyes from under in-
describle bats and bonnets, as Miss Annie Forsyth,
attended by eight bridesmaids, wdked up the church
to meet her affianced, Mr, George Evans, of the E iilway
Department. The bride wore a rich white satin and
orange blossoms; the maids were airy in cream nun’s
cloth, with tasteful trimmings. After tbe ceremony,
the party drove to Nithsiale, where Compignoni pro-
vided breakfast, and the usual speeches were made, and
everybody wished everybody else every happiness.
For the evening, invitations had been issued for a ball,
and about eighty wore present thereat. Among them
were Messrs. J. A, Forsyth, T. E. Smith, M.P.,
John Young, D. Kirkridie, Mountain, W. V. Bead,
Chapman, Henderson. &o. Mrs. Smith wore a beautiful
dress of claret and satin, trimmed with cream
Spanish lace, passementerie, and flowers. Miss Keating
was graceful in white and hyacinths, and Miss Webb in
pink silk trimmed with plush. The bride and her maids
were of course in their wedding raiment. Many dresses
were handsome, cream and pink prevailing most. A
cream silk, trimmed with lace and cerise satin, waa
in contrast to its brunette wearer. Twenty-four dances
were executed, and the ball was appreciated all the more
as it was not crowded.

What is described as the " most finished wadding cere-

E Anderson to Mias O’Gonor. The bride was attended

make any wedding ** finished,” we should think. Mr

enjoyable dance was lately held to celebrate the open-
ing of anew school at Kilkiysn. Moleskins and calicos
wore fashionable, and there was a sumptuous supper of
salt horse. The music was all that could be des’red—
and more. As several concertinas played different
tunes, everyone could choose which he I’ked and
dance to it, At a recent Winter Party out West, a
medical man and a bank clerk danced together, because
they considered no ladies fit to dance with them.

The Woniora.
Last week the steam collier Woniora was over-
turned and foundered in a gale off Botany Heads,
sixteen out of seventeen men went down. It is
said that she only had 242 tons of coal on board —
or eight tons leas than her registered tonnage.
If so, she must have been wonderfully less sea-
worthy than sae was supposed to be. Experience
goes to show that colliers generally take twice
their registered tonnage. Is it a fact that
everything is generally left to the discretion
of thiiir capt-uns, who are further stimulated by
receiving a percentage upon every ton of cargo
they take? Was it so with Captain Lauridsen in
this instance ? Or is the Woniora only the last
coffin-ship gone to an expected grave ? We have
read the Herald's comments concerning the loss
of the Woniora. The leading daily unreservedly
assures the public that nobody is to blame in the
matter but the Almighty. In doing so, the
Herald manifested an absolutely indecent haste,
for no inquiry whatever has yet been held into the
circumstances under which sixteen men were sent
to their last account. Iho province of a great
and powerful daily in such a case as this is not to
tell people that ,- it’s all right.” Its duty is, if
need be, to spend thousands in ascertaining
whether any living person is responsible to the
law and to the widows and orphans of the men
who have found graves at sea.
The Tombstone in the Garden:
A FICTION FOUNDED ON FACT.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The little bash township was very quiet. It
was one of those sleepy midsummer afternoons when
the air seems like vaporous gold and the sounds of
life are dim and indistinct as the memories of the dis-
tant past. traveller riding musingly by imagines
on an afternoon like this that he is passing through the
landscape of an Oriental dream. All noises are mel-
lowed into faint music by the golden air. The clang of
the blacksmith’s hammer and tho tinkle of the cow-
bells sound lew and far-off as the voices of shadows on
the shores of sleep. They become a part of the silence,
and are mixed in the listener’s brain with the vague
echoes of o'd romance that are heard at timee in this
new land of hard reality. I was sitting on this after-
noon in the stnfty little back-parlonr of one of the local
newspaper offices. Tho proprietor of the journal
always alluded reverently to this den as the editorial
san jtum. I was the editor. The paper came out three
times a week, with a leading article in each issue, but
as the subjects for disquisition were confined to the
Chinese question, the Irish difficulty, and t>.e Besotted
Ignorance and Contemptible Villainy of the proprietor
of the other journal, the work was not very heavy. The
owner of the paper to which I devoted my flashing pen
used to write most of the philippics against his
antagonist. On these occasions he would retire into
himself for about three days, at the end of which time
he would come out with a production which nobody but
himself—or a mule—could have written. It was a sort
of Sooratio dialectic, where the argument was stated
so that the otuer man invariably got the worst of it.
This warfare and the entry of an occasional swagman
into the town, or the straying of the rival proprietor’s
me-eyed horse into the backyard of our office, and his
subsequent disappearance down a pit which had b*en
artfully constructed for tho purpose of discouraging
trespasses of this sort, helped to keep me from utterly
dying with ennui. Bat it was a hard struggle.
• » •
I sat there moodily wondering what 1 should do
to kill time. I ran over on my fingers the count of the
excitements which th« town had to offer, and, of
course, discovered thet I had used them all up. Drink-
in? with the drunken doctor, who was always in a state
of serai delirium. bad no more charm for me than talk-
ing divinity with the parson, or literature with the
poundkeeoer. The mad ecstasy of sitting on the foot-
bridge before the office door smoking Swiss clears and
p'aying seven-up had become worn-out, while the
solemn j >y I used to feel in cheating tdo proprietor’s
r>nrblind grandmother at chess had departed f >r ever.
I would like to have done this, too, but the roads w-oe
bad and 1 had given my blankets away to a noblenran’s
eon’who had passed through the township about a w tek
before on a pilgrimage to some place where stumps
con'd be grabbed without a fellow soiling his hauux,
you know. I could not say with Gordon’s trooper that
I had “ won tome honour and gained sune gold ’’ over
my literary career iu that township Journalists were
not allowed to widen their phylacteries dowa there. As
for gold, it was to me a fabulous mineral, a Scheherazade
fan'asy. Gold ! What had I to do with gold who b"d
to screw my salary out of the sale of dog-forms i S >
that I would have run a fair chance of ageing away in
that same piaoo till I became the toothless oldest
inhabitant, and had the traveller’s finger of scorn
pointed at me as the greatest old liar he had ever met,
only for an occurrence which took place on the par-
ticular afternoon previously referred to.
* • •
“ Come in ” I yelled in answer to a knock at the
door. The knock was soft enough, but I was expecting
the saddler over the way who had sold me a spavined
horse on credit about a month before to call with his
account, and Chrysostom could not have spoken gently
under such circumstances. I was mistaken. A gaunt,
pale-faced female, arrayed in woeful weeds of solemn
black that made her look like one of De Qaincey’s
three Ladies of Sorrow, stalked into the room with tho
gait of one walking behind a bier, and then stopped
dead and fixed mo with a stony stare. I was too much
awed by the mournful majesty of her presence to ask
her to take anything eo common as a chair. She saved
me the trouble. Starting once again her professional
stride, she moved around the table like a cypress on
wheels, and then.smilelessly bending her knees, dropped
down bedde me on the sofa. I should not have b«en
more thunderstruck if a belated nightmare had cara-
ooled in and chosen to keep me company until the veil
of darkness had fallen upon this end of the world again.
After refri<eratlug me with another ioy glare she laid a
long and bony hand upon my arm, and started off it* an
organ tone like tho -Marge utterance of the early
ffod?:” ...
"Young man!
“ Madam."
“ Look at mo in the eye.’
I looked, blushing modestly the while.
“ I like yon."
I bowed.
“ You have a truthful eye."
I smiled naively. ,
And your head is well-shaped. It is like a kerosene
tin."
I rose to go. ...
She stopped me with a gentle pressure of her hand
that felt like the closing in of aa Artie ice-floe and
continued —
“ Your countenance, though uncommonly common-
glace, is guileless and nnfurrowod by the wrinkles of
dissipation.”
I smiled again—this time in my sleeve.
• Therefore, youtg min, because of these qua i ties
and the ignorance which is inherent in yon, Ichoose you
r o listen to my story I have been long looking for a
hearer like you—l wanted to fiad a person utterly devoid
of ideas so that my story should not (jet mixed up in
his head with anything else. I never expected to fiad
me so completely in accordance with my wishes.
Listen— , , , . ,
“Ten years ago, I was a happy, innocent girl.
My father was a rich man, and I bad everything my
heart conld desire, exc-pt the one supreme gift without
which all others are dust and ashes, and with which all
others are needless,”
“ Hash ?" I ventured to enquire, timidly.
“No, young man,” she replied, severely ; “Love.
Money I have, but what money will buy love ?"
" If the live-long devotion of a heart which never
knew love till now, can make late amends for that
unaccountable vacuum in your previous psychological
experience,” I exclaimed, passionately dropping on one
knee; and then, after a pau°e # eeeinf? that the ring she
wore on her finger was a horse-hair one, “ I have no
doubt whatever that such a heart oould be found by
patting a small ad. in our next issue—haif-a-orown an
inch, cash down."
I began to think that she was not so rich as she
pretended.
“ Ton misunderstand me,” she went on mournfully.
" I have loved and lost Never more while the sun
shines or the moonlight wavers on the tomb of my
darling dead shall this seared heart be healed by affec-
tion's holy brand again."
“ Who was your darling dead ?” I enquired, some-
what flippantly, perhaps
“ He was the eldest son of the late Emperor of China,
and, if he were alive, would now be wearing his father’s
crown," she answered, haughtily rising up to ner full
height and casting upon in? a look of imperial scorn.
“I m sure I beg pardon, Madam,” I murmured;
“ T “-’n’tknow that ino was of such exalted
rank.’*
•• t'eor dear Hwang Chow 1" she moaned, kissing her
knuckles and bursting into tears, “ this ring is made out
of his darling old pigtail."
Perceiving upon my face a smile like an Alpine cre-
vasse, she stopped weeping and burst out savagely:
“ You ara line all the rest. You think a Chinaman
has no more heart or soul than a beast. You think he
is a degraded being whom it Is a shame to touch. You
think that, ha has no feeling, no love, no anything
human. Why, I tell you Hwang Chow was the gent’eet
and kindest creature ihat ever breathed. He would
not have harmed a living thing. And yet, when,
having saved hi u from the brn al rage of your snp ru r
race, my pity grew to love, I had to bide it deep down in
my heart, even from him. This was the love
I had yearned for, that comes once and no
more; hut I had not bargained for the
sorrow that came with it. Day after day I had to see
on my father’s station my gentle-hearted Hwang Chow
beaten and ballied about, and staggering meekly along
under burdens that -/ere killing him, without daring to
say a word. And when at last he fell sick and lay in iis
little hut in the garden lonely and nncared for, without
a hand to roach him a drink of water, I had to steal
down at dusk to do him small services and say what
poor words c* f consolation I could to him. My father
would have hunted me from the homestead with as
little mercy as he would have shown to a wild dog. if
he had seen me. Bat I had not to run these risks for
long. After a weak of suffering, patiently and uncom-
plainingly borne, the tenderest hearted creature on the
earth died, and was buried like a deg Buried, do you
hear, in a ditch, while hours were lying under costly
tombstones. I tell you Hwang Chow was a more cul-
tured gentleman than the best of them.
* • •
II After my father died and I could do as I pleased,"
she continued, “I had my poor Hwang Chow’s romairs
removed to a grave in the garden wherein he had
laboured, and a tombstone with his title as Heir Ap-
parent to the imp-rial throne of China placed over
them. You can come and st eit it you will. And now I
want you to write me an epitaph for him ”
After a few minutes communion with my soul, I
struck off and handed her the following :
Hwang Chow lies here. He was a don
At euchre. Yell out louder.
His soul has to his fathers gone,
His body’s gone to Chowder.
She did not see the elegiao beauty of this so I wrote
her something that brought in an ang“l carrying eff
Hwang by the pigtail, and she was satisfied. Mo was I,
for she paid me enough for doing it to enable me to
cone here and write this lie.
• • •
I learnt before leaving the township that the story
was a hoax, or rather mat the lady had been cheated.
It appears this Chinaman had told her that it was a
custom with the members of the Imperial Family of
China to bo buried with large sums of money on their
person. If he died, and this custom were not observed,
he would be exiled from communion with his ancestors
for ever. She brought him what money she could lay
her hands on, and on receiving it he bribed two or
three of the ronseabouts on the station to swear that
he had died and to fill the coffin with stones and plaat
it in tae ditch. Ha had shammed sickness all the
time. He was last seen running a fan-tan swindle in
Lower George-street,
