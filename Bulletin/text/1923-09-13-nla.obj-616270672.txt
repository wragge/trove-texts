The Purpose of Art
“The painter is no longer interested in the
material manifestations of nature, but desires to ex-
press the .effect of nature upon himself.” — Konocly.
“Pechskih shows a flower-puece which goes far
beyond reality in the over-accentuation of experi-
enced edior-sensarion.”— Ganske.
“Far beyond reality"!
In the light of those modestly-triumphant
statements from the catalogue of European
pictures lately shown by Mr. Penleigli Boyd,
I have had to re-label my painful sensa-
tions. Those puerilities of color, those tonal
falsities, are not, as I had supposed, incom-
petence or slovenliness. It is merely that
the artist, has soared beyond" any care for
the truth of things, and now seeks only to
express himself, to foster his own shortcom-
ings, to exalt his incapacities, to be the
most rampant of individualists in order to
make virtues of his own limitations: it is
the short cut to fame. Nature is no
longer seen through temperament; the cap
is over the lens. Sky of Turner, thou art
obscured, and Corot’s birds no longer fly
through the trees.
When I was a student we believed in a
certain J. F. Millet (now, alas! obsolete),
who said: “It must be an enormous folly
or an enormous vanity which makes some
men think they can rectify the pretended
bad taste or the errors of nature” ; also, in
one John Constable, who said (speaking of
his own advent) : “There is room enough
for a natural painter. The great vice of
the present day is bravura, an attempt to
do something beyond the truth.” That “pre-
sent day” was in 1802. In 1923 these art-
less Europeans who fancy themselves to be
adding new wings to painting are only re-
peating history. Perhaps there were even
individualists of this type in Rembrandt’s
studio, though I do not think so. If there
were they were faithfully dealt with in their
day, and have faded into nothingness,
canvas and all.
But it was not the freaks, the fashion-
mongers of this exhibition, that dealt us
the worst shocks. A sprinkling of such can
be met with equanimity. It was in the rank
and file of the work, which seems intended
to be realistic but isn’t, that more danger
lay for the student and the public. Take a
few instances. There is an Orpen, certainly
less objectionable than the two already in
our Melbourne Gallery, but quite flat, with
no air between the head and background nor
anywhere else. There is an Augustus John,
priced at 900 guineas, also flat, slovenly,
poor in quality, without one of the redeem-
ing points of the Orpen. Studio-sweepings,
pure and simple! There is a Strang. A
charmingly economical notion is abroad that
if a painter has in his outfit even one or
two of the many qualities considered essen-
tial by the great men, or by any great school
(such as the Dutch 17tli century or the
English 18th century), he need not bother
about the others: he may water his stock
without imperilling his fame. For instance,
If he have a good sense of proportion and
a grip of character, he may, unscathed, do
fearful things with color and atmosphere
(or more probably without them). Strang
did. This is one of the results. Why should
a modern with his eyes open insist upon
drawing in paint an “iron-bound outline,”
such as Cimabue might have done in all
honesty and simplicity? Can he, so doing,
escape the sin of affectation? There is a
Collier: two pictures on one canvas, a por-
trait and a “genre,” loudly proclaiming
their mutual incompatibility and clamoring
to be cut asunder. There is a- Besnard, a
nude with rainbow-hued flesh, every shadow
annihilated by brilliant reflected lights from
nowhere in particular, reposing in a land-
scape new to science and totally unlit.
If these are the great men (as our cen-
tury counts greatness) what shall be said
of the lesser lights? Not one in twenty has
any arresting naturalness or quality of
charm. A second visit would be for the
sake of the etchings and lithographs (really
fine) and of the Le Sidaner. This picture
is obscured by a needless mannerism that
forces on us the idea of paint which we
would rather forget. “If the mannerism
had never existed, painting would always
have been easily understood,” said Con-
stable ; and Leonardo: “One painter ought
never to imitate the manners of any other,
because in that case he cannot be called
the child of nature but the grandchild.”
But through Le Sidaner’s mannerism (or
too obtrusive method) can be sensed the
painter’s knowledge and sympathy, and
seen under proper conditions that defect
would be softened. It was almost the only
satisfying landscape painting in the room.
Such still-life a*nd flower-paintings as could
be properly seen were shocking examples.
The outstanding lack of the exhibition
was truth of tone. “Painting is a science,
and should be pursued as an inquiry into
the laws of nature Tone, tone is the most
seductive and inviting quality a picture or
print can possess: it is the first thing seen,
and, like a flower, invites to our examina-
tion of the plant itself.” So said Constable,
who is dragged into Mr. Konody’s foreword,
dubbed as an artistic “anarchist” (and,
therefore, comrade),' but not sufficiently at-
tended to otherwise. To neglect tone, there-
fore, is to lower the ■whole conception of
art; the go-as-you-please methods and aims
involved in these ultra-modern ideas will
necessarily lead to their collapse in practice.
When the aim is not nature, there is no
standard; every artistic excess becomes pos-
sible, and every shade of incapacity may
flaunt itself as talent. Northcote once said
to Constable, in an exhibition (speaking of
a painting not supernatural but unnatural) :
“Is it not folly for a man to paint what
he can never see? Is it not sufficiently
difficult to paint what he does see?” Con-
stable, commenting on the incident (“this
delightful lesson,” he calls it), adds: “What
is painting but an imitative art? An art
that is to realise, not to feign. I con-
stantly observe that every man who will
not submit to long toil in the imitation of
nature, flies off, becomes a phantom, and
produces dreams of nonsense and abortions.
He thinks to screen himself under ‘a fine
imagination,’ which is generally, and almost
always in young men, the scapegoat of folly
and idleness.” These moderns, instead of
“going beyond,” have not attained so much
of the truth of nature, of air and light, as
did Jan van Eyck in the 14th century.
There is a welcome hint of discourage-
ment in Mr. Konody’s foreword: he marvels
that England and America should be cold
to an art development arising out of this
civilisation of their own making. _So the
English-speaking peoples, with their char-
acteristic commonsense, do not respond to
the call of art divorced from nature. Praise
be to St. Luke! It is hardly to be feared
that much harm will result in these other
latitudes of the race. We have ideals of
our own. We are not without traditions of
landscape art —“trailing clouds of glory” from
Claude and Wilson, Cuyp and Hobbema.
PICTOR.
An Archaic Suicide
Man was first a foocl-gatherer —he walked
abroad and plucked and killed what his appe-
tite suggested and his prowess allowed. When
he became a food-producer, when he found
he could grow things for himself and took to
agriculture and irrigation, he was able to
squat in closely-settled communities ; and thus,
by becoming static, as it were, he started
to move —along the road to the thing we call
civilisation.
We have traces of old civilisations all
across the world —from _ Egypt eastward
through India, Indonesia, Oceania to
America—and living amid the age-old dust
of them we have peoples who can tell us
nothing definite of how the old-time glories
came or went. Seeing that agriculture and
irrigation represent the first step towards
civilisation, it is conceivable that men in
very widely-separated places could indepen-
dently take that step, and one school of
thought has had it that those old civilisations,
with their beginnings born of a uniformity
in the human mind, developed each along its
own lines according to its Climatic and geo-
graphic environment. But the new theo-
rists are assailing this conception, and their
shrewd assaults are shaking it badly at its
foundations.
Their case is put with admirable clarity by
W. J. Perry, M.A.,, Reader in Comparative
Religion, Manchester University, in The
Children of the Sun, a big and fascinating
work just published .by Methuen and Co.
He is not much concerned with sheer specu-
lation, but brings a close study to bear upon
the facts available regarding that chain of
extinct civilisations stretching from Egypt
to America. Primarily, he finds throughout
the chain a matured cultural uniformity that
can be explained only by a common origin—
the one “archaic civilisation” that spread,
not many civilisations that evolved locally
and independently. All through the region
he traces, for instance, agriculture, irriga-
tion, stone-construction and images, pottery,
metal-working and pearl-fishing, polished-
stone implements, the ruling class in two
divisions, the sun-cult, mother-right, mummi-
fication, totemic clans, dual organisation of
society and exogamy. No other civilisation
that followed has been marked by all these
culture elements, and, apart from Egypt
(where their evolution can be traced), every-
thing points to the archaic civilisation having
planted itself practically full-blown in every
locality where its remains are found. It
was an imported thing, and the fact that in
every case it came to an abrupt end helps to
set the seal on its extraneity.
How came this old culture to spread across
the world? Mr. Perry starts it from Egypt.
The developments in the Nile Valley can be
clearly followed from far back beyond the
beginning of the Fifth Dynasty; but in that
dynasty the social, political, economic and
religious features of Egyptian society assumed
the typical archaic civilisation shape—and in
that dynasty the kings for the first time
called themselves the “Children of the Sun,”
just as did later the ruling classes in India,
Indonesia, Micronesia, Melanesia, Polynesia
and America. Step by step the Egyptian
culture spread through these regions, reach-
ing America eventually somewhere about the
beginning of our era. The driving force be-
hind this outward movement was the value
—originally largely a magical value—placed
upon such things as gold, diamonds, tur-
quoise, pearls, aromatic gums, etc. These
things were sought, and the seekers settled
Where they found them, and thus implanted
the cultural elements that had evolved on
the banks of old Nile. The author shows
in a fashion rather startling to those who
had never looked at the subject from his
angle that in every place, from Egypt across
to America, where megalithic or other re-
mains of the archaic civilisation are found,
there exist, or have existed in quantity, some
or other of those highly-prized substances
that originally lured the seekers forth. And,
backed by a wealth of research, he binds
each locality to Egypt with the threads of
social organisation and religious cults. This
not only in relation to the peoples of the
past, for he brings home vividly the surviv-
ing influences of the Children of the Sun
upon the existing peoples—in their tradi-
tions, social organisation, their magic, their
treatment of the dead and so on.
The breakdown of the archaic civilisation
Mr. Perry ascribes to the substitution of
the war-god for the sun-god, the consequent
development of a warlike character (“the
available evidence is dead against the ascrip-
tion of regular pugnacious behavior to early
man”), and the hostility of the two sides
of the dual organisation which had its be-
ginnings in Egypt itself in the actions of
the ruling groups and the struggles of the
rulers of Upper and Lower Egypt for
supremacy. This hostility was carried
throughout the whole region of the archaic
civilisation, which ended by practically de-
stroying itself. The communities gave up
their peaceful habits to take to fighting on
a large scale; at that point culture in the

arts and crafts ceased, and —civilisation
drowned in its own blood !
So the Children of the Sun, having
stretched a band of culture round the world,
were .by themselves wiped out, mainly
through those two agencies which have
worked woe and desolation in humanity so
often since—priestcraft and war. And now
along the path of their passing pretty well
all that is left in the concrete are scattered
piles of finely-wrought stone, old evidences
of mining and some transplanted food-bear-
ing plants; and of the more imponderable
sort “native” traditions of a sky-born people
who were the fount of much knowledge, per-
sisting essentials of social organisation, and
systems of magic largely centred on the
things they left behind and the things they
sought—the latter fact one which renders
eloquent, for instance, the part quartz plays
in the magic of the region to-day.
Even Australia felt a ripple of that world-
wide wave of culture. Over a big area our
aborigines have traditions of one or two
super-men belonging to the sky-world, to
whom they owe their culture and their social
organisation, their indebtedness extending even
to such things as stone implements, nets,
canoes, weapons, etc. These culture-heroes
did not stay, but “went back to the sky.”
It looks as if they came seeking gold (the
importance they attached to it seems to be
reflected here, too, in the way quartz enters
into the magic of so many tribes), and they
either gave up the quest or, before they
found workable deposits, the break-up of the
archaic civilisation came about. Had it
been otherwise we would to-day probably be
puzzling over mysterious age-old megaliths
at Mt. Morgan, Bendigo and Kalgoorlie, and
Mr. Perry would be insisting that we re-
claim from the ghost of Hargraves his re-
ward for the discovery of payable gold in
Australia. For they are an iconoclastic
crowd, these archaeologists) when they get
among a young people’s traditions.
B. F. T.
An Early Pessimist
The first thing we hear about Tutank-
hamen—the name seems to be pronounced
Tutankhamen —is from a clay tablet sent
by his widow to the King of the Hittites. It
was to say that her husband, the King of
Egypt, had died ; that she was a lone widow
without a son, whereas the King of the
Hittites had plenty ; and would he spare her
one from his abundance, that she might
marry him and be his mother? This little
dubiety about the prohibited degrees seems
to have been not unusual in the Egyptian
royal family ; quite common, perhaps, was a
confusion between sister and wife. But
it did not prevent the Egyptian monarchy
from enduring for some thousands of years.
Inextricably interwoven with the mystery
of Tutankhamen was the mystery of that
Amenhotep who preceded him next monarch
but one. For the first time in the thousands
of years of Egyptian history a monarch
arose who broke from the ancient Polytheism
with Amen at its head; at a time
when Amenhotep should have been fighting
and worshipping after the manner of his an
cestors he would sit brooding with the long,
long thoughts of youth, and puzzling over
whence he came and whither he was going—
just as most clever youths do to-day. But
Amenhotep found certainty, because to him
it was clear that the only really divine thing
in his knowledge was the sun that warmed
him and caused things to grow. And the
only really divine thing about the sun was
its disk, wherein lay the source of its heat
and light.
Amenhotep seems to have been a clever
young fellow who had a mind of his owm
that followed things to their inevitable con-
clusion. He began by building a temple to
Aten in his capital. Thebes. This blasphemy
roused priests and people against him, so
he left Thebes and started a new capital of
his own on soil which was undefiled by any
memories of Amen, the old head-god. In
this new city Amenhotep dwelt in peace, wor-
shipping the source of light and heat, sur-
rounded by his family and a few faithful
Ministers; rejoicing to destroy as far as he
could all traces of the impious worship of
Amen, whence he had derived his own name.
To efface the A r ery memory 7 of his youthful
sin he changed his name to Akhenaton; at
last he could look his god in the face (through
smoked glasses, no doubt) ; at last the sense
of inexpiable sin was purged from him ; at
last he could really feel that he was going
to Heaven. But it was too early in the
world for successful Hedonism —even to-
day a king cannot do as he wishes —and
priests and people rose against him.
Then Akhenaton died, only 36 years old,
and he was succeeded by a monarch of whom
nothing but the name survives: Tutank -
hamen—brother, half-brother or son-in-law
of Akhenaton; relationships became mixed
with their quaint notions of whom to marry.
Tut. had relapsed, because his name shows
that he had resumed the worship of the only
true god, Amen. Possibly it was because
of this that he was honored by the priest-
hood with the wonderful tomb which Lord
Carnarvon so recently discovered. His
mummy has not yet been found, and people
are anxiously 7 awaiting its discovery, because
there is reason to believe that there was
something physically very much the matter
with Akhenaton. He was not ashamed to
be depicted exactly as he was, for there was
no false modesty about Akhenaton. His
head was flattened and very protuberant at
the back ; his jaw was large, and projected
sharply downwards—a very Hapsburg jaw,
his abdomen was enormous, and there was
a curious deformity of the knees; he seems
to have naturally assumed a theatrical atti-
tude of strutting. Akhenaton worshipping
the Disk is indeed a quaint figure of ugliness.
The doctors are already quarrelling over
the name of his disease. Some say he had
water on the brain —hydrocephalus. Others
attribute his deformity to some disease of
the pituitary body, such ag may cause giant-
ism or other deformity. Some Egyptologists
attribute his change of religion to the influ-
ence of his women. Man always blames
everything on the woman, thus following
Adam. But to me, who do not profess to
be a skilled Egyptologist, Akhenaton’s heresy
may be otherwise explained by calling in the
spirit, not of woman, but of man, of which
we hear so much. What was Akhenaton
thinking as he sat there brooding, discussing
the Truth, with his tutor, the fat old Ai,
while the terrible Queen-Mother, Tiy, looked
on with eagle eyes to see that he did nothing
to bring ruin upon Egypt? He was think-
ing : “What did old Amen mean by making
a figure of fun like me, that everybody is
laughing at? Calls himself a god, does he,
in his inscrutable wisdom? If he can’t do
anything better than that I’m not going to
worship him any more. I’m going to set up
a real honest god of my own who would
have made me like other men if I had given
him the chance, and worship him in my
own way. There’s that bright shining thing
up there that makes everything grow; let’s
just work it all out —what parts of Him
do the wonderful things we see? Why. of
course, there’s the disk. That’s really what
gives rise to all the wonders, so I’m going to
worship that as the only thing that I really do
know for myself.” Akhenaton was thus pro-
bably the first philosophical pessimist. I can
quite well imagine him saying for the first
time, “There’s nothing new, and nothing
true; and no matter”—the thing we think
we have discovered as the result of the wis-
dom of the ages.
So, having quite made up his mind to
wallow in pessimism, and. as the Egyptolo-
gists say, live only for the present day with
no thought of the terrible future life that is
to come, he seized the money of the wor-
shippers of Amen, just as our own good
King Henry VIII. seized the money of the
monasteries, set up great temples for the
worship of Aten, and retired to his new capi-
tal to let the world get on in its unbelief
without him —a forthright fellow Akhenaton.
Amen punished him for it, because all his
daughters were as hideous as himself,
with great pot-bellies, thick lips and prog-
nathous jaws. Their flattened heads, much
after the fashion that Akhenaton had set,
are supposed to be the result of tightly
strapping them in infancy.
Men with Akhenaton’s disease seldom
live very long. In due course Tutankhamen
ascended the throne, and was buried by
a grateful priesthood in a splendid tomb
when his turn came. He had seen the truth
and returned to the ancient faith of their
fathers: - but we do not know very much
about him beyond his name. It will be in-
teresting to find his mummy and see if the
disease of Akhenaton affected Tutankhamen
as it had descended to his four little daugh-
ters.
Akhenaton is said to have been arrogant,
self-opinionated, too sure about his religion;
ignorant of men and things, and knowing
nothing about king-craft. It is noted as an
instance of his arrogance that he described
himself as “living in Truth.” Whether that
meant that he had discovered that realism
is the one true form of Art, or that disk-
worshipping is the one true form of religion,
I do not know; but I cannot help feeling
a sneaking and disgraceful sympathy for this
early pessimist.
Be sure you know what a pessimist is
before you say that Akhenaton was not one.
It does not necessarily mean that he lived
in gloom.

The Alleged Decline of the Novel
“E.F.” (R.P. 16/8/’23) expresses his admi-
ration for the old-time novel and his dis-
like for the modern. Certainly the novel
has undergone a vast transformation during
the last half-century. But has the change
been for the worse? The mutation has not
been the result of any intellectual inferiority
on the part of the modern novelists, but
has been the inevitable consequence of the
hurry and bustle of present-day life as com-
pared with the leisurely movement of 50 or
60 years ago, when practically the whole
reading public consisted of country squires
and a few intellectuals with plenty of spare
time in which to indulge their literary
fancies. One cannot expect any great de-
mand from a public absorbed in a struggle
for material wealth for novels which do not
concentrate on any one line of thought or
scene for more than a chapter, but
switch backwards and forwards, hither and
thither, from one character to another, from
Europe to America, without any regard for
the limited time at the disposal of the
average reader, who only picks up a book
after his dinner for a few hours’ relaxation
after his day’s toil. The dema’nd has oeen
for unity of action, for concentration on a
single theme, and for pithy descriptions of
the characters, with a plot culminating in a
dramatic effort condensed into a couple of
pages. The advance of education has also
played its part in the change, so that we have
an insistent demand for descriptive beauty
and fecundity of style. Modern novelists
have risen to the occasion, catering for this
natural taste of their readers; in the place
of Dickens, Thackeray and the Brontes have
sprung up R. L. Stevenson, Thomas Hardy,
Conrad, Galsworthy and countless others..
“E.F.” is hardly fair in quoting Hutchin-
son’s “If Winter Comes” as a typical
example of modern taste. It was only a
nine-days’ wonder, and owed its immense
popularity partly to its originality—or abo-
riginally—of style, and partly to judicious
advertising by the publishers. It cannot be re-
garded as having any permanent place in
English literature. It was just, the fad of
a public recovering from the effects of the
war and emerging from a period of literary
stagnation—a public hungry for some
novelty to relieve the monotony of that inun-
dation of Yankee trash which took place
during the dark period. In a generation
Mark Sabre will be a dim memory of the
past, and the book will only be mentioned by
the aged as an example of the follies of their
youth.
One of “E.F.’s” complaints is that present-
day novelists do not give us the multiplicity of
characters of the Dickens school; tha t they
confine themselves to one central figure, like
George Meredith’s Egoist. Let us take as
a typical example of a modern novel Con-
rad’s “Nostromo.” Here are at the least
half-a-dozen first-rate characters described
with deft mastery; and the book has the
additional advantage over its great predeces-
sors of being written with felicitous charm
and beauty of language.
It is not unreasonable to believe that the
names of Conrad, Galsworthy, Thomas Hardy
and Ibanez are stamped just as indelibly on
the annals of literature as those of Diekens,
Thackeray and their contemporaries; that if
Fagin, Captain Cuttle and Sarah Gamp are
conjured up as persons having a real exist-
ence, so in a couple of generations will Con-
rad’s puppets strut along the bridges of their
ships and steam up mysterious rivers, leav-
ing a trail of white smoke in their wake
while churning the sluggish waters that drift
slowly out to sea. Probably Ibanez’s Prince
Lubmoff will captivate women, and his
Duchess de Delille will gamble away her
substance at Monte Carlo, long after Thack-
eray’s Warringtons and Castletons have
passed into oblivion. And surelv Galsworthy,
with his refinement of style and dramatic
torce, is entitled to as permanent a place in
our language as Thackeray with his ver-
bosity, evasive humor and harsh sarcasm.
DOUGLAS P. JONES.
Secret Poetry
McKee Wright on poetry and its public:
Mi. Hugh McCrae is quite in error in imagining
that in my article on “Interesting Poetry” i was
taking him to task or that my remarks arose out of
a conversation with him. As a matter of fact, that
article was already written and in the editor’s
hands when the conversation referred to occurred.
But 1 should like to protest strongly and emphatically
against the introduction of private conversations
into public discussions. In the first place, a private
conversation is of the same nature as a private
letter, and should not in decency be published with-
out the consent of the person quoted; and in the
second place, the report of a private conversation
can never be accurate—and is in this case very
inaccurate indeed—in that it can never reproduce
the tone and spirit of the half-remembered remarks.
Whether Mr. McCrae is among the large number of
poets who profess to ignore their public or not, does
not seem to me to matter much ; for whatever else
may be said about his work it is always interest-
ing. He does not belong to the increasing number
of those whose writing is obscured by more or less
personal references to matters of which the reader
can have no knowledge. What did lead to my re-
marks in the conversation which Mr. McCrae so
wrongly reports was my regret that liis very interest-
ing work should be published in such a way that it
was not available to the ordinary public, but hidden
away by the collectors of Norman Lindsay’s work.
Magnificent as Mr. Lindsay’s illustrations
are to such work of Mr. McCrae’s as I have
seen, the statement that there is hardly a verse in
the latter’s work which has not been borrowed from
something done previously by the artist would not
bear, close investigation. It is finely generous, but,
on internal evidence, it is not true. Hugh McCrae
is quite capable of standing alone—few men in the
world to-day are better capable of doing so. Mr.
Lindsay is a very great artist —probably as great
in the medium in which he works as it is possible
for any man to be —but the poet working in a medium
which is at once infinitely more emotional as well
as surer and more enduring must take precedence of
the' artist. Mr. McCrae entirely misunderstands his
own genius if he thinks that he has a right to
allow it to be obscured by a Norman Lindsay, a
Rubens, a Michael Angelo or any other mighty
worker on a lower plane. Take an example by
way of illustration of the relative proportions of
things. Sir Joshua Reynolds was far greater as an
artist than his contemporary Oliver Goldsmith was
as a poet; yet after the lapse of half-a-dozen genera-
tions the truth stands out clearly in the view of all
men that Oliver Goldsmith is by far the greater
human force. Mr. Lindsay may deserve very greatly
at the hands of Mr. McCrae; but what has Australia
done that her poets should hide their work from
her and only give it to a handful of collectors?
Masters and Men, by Philip Guedalla (Constable).
Guedalla, who is the author of a charming and witty
study of the French Second Empire, is a light essayist
of high talent, and this collection shows him at
his best. Even Beerbohm is hardly his superior as
a delicate ironist, and he almost stands alone in
his method of pursuing a vein of urbane banter and
then bringing up the reader on his haunches with a
knife-like sentence. Dean Inge, the Sidney W ebbs,
G. K. Chesterton, Disraeli, Saintsbury and others
are handled playfully ; but in every article there is a
note of derision in many an outwardly innocsi v
phrase.
The Dead Command, by Vincente Blasco Ibanez
(Fisher Unwin). The story of Jaime Febrer, the
last of a noble Majorcan family, and his loves and
hates, padded to full novel length with heavy de-
scriptive coloring and historical reminiscence. On
page 1 Jaime is getting up with the intention ot
having breakfast with a despised “Chueta ’ (Jewish)
family, towards one of whom he is casting a matri-
monial eye; but he doesn’t keep the engagemen.
until page 88, as Ibanez wants to explain all about
the young man and the long line of ancestors who
have been responsible for his hawk-like nose and
somewhat predatory personality. It is not uninterest-
ing reading; but lovers of straight narratives ot
incident will yawn. One of Febrer’s romances, by
the way, is with an English girl who becomes a
Doctor, of Music at Melbourne University, and lets
him fondle her pale loveliness because he reminds
her of Richard Wagner 1
“M.D.” : Illustrious Pierre Loti chose a last resting-
place as lonely in its way, if not nearly as remote,
as those of Cecil Rhodes and R. L. lt
is right in the centre of the little island of Oleron,
which lies an hour’s steam from the rnouth of
the Charente. The funeral ceremonies were of the
simplest. A despatch-boat took the coffin from
Rochefort-su.r-Charente, where Loti was born; on
reaching the sea four destroyers escorted it to the
island; the final stage was a journey in an artillery-
waggon to a lonely spot at Saint Pierre d’Ol&ron.
Bv Loti’s express desire, his body was buried “deep
down in the ground, so that it could more readily
mingle with the earth.”
“8.C.F.”: “C.McL.,” in the course of an illuminat-
ing commentary upon Dr. Hayward’s book (R.P.
23/8/’23), says': “Of course the real objection to
Coueism is that it is very doubtful whether that
part of the unconscious mind which is liable to
suggestion has anything whatever to do with that
nervous organisation which controls heart and
arteries.” Very remarkable testimony to the contrary
is to be had from the experiment with what is
known as Chevreul’s Pendulum. A marble or a
shilling is attached by means of string to the end
of a pencil. A circle with diameters at right angles
is drawn, and the bob is held as steadily as possible
over the centre of the circle. Concentrated attention
is now fixed on the (imaginary) movement of the
pendulum along one diameter, the bob being held
stationary the while. It is a curious fact that
a swinging motion of the pendulum is initiated
without any conscious : impulsion. If concentration
is shifted along the line of the other diameter,
movement will gradually cease, to recommence at
right angles. Again, if attention is directed solely
to the confines of the figure, movement will take
place at great speed about the circumference. There
is here no question of conscious promotion of the
action; it is primarily an operation of the sub-
conscious mechanism which underlies volition. The
subject wills the end, but not the means. These
facts obviously refute a denial of auto-suggestive
influence upon the nervous system which controls
muscular activity.

ELECTRIFY YOUR HOME.
It Means Better Living with Less Effort
That is probably the goal we are all striving for—
“better living with less effort.” Particularly is it true
when applied to the home.
Better living means more comforts, more time for
recreation—recreation for both mind and body. Less
effort means less unnecessary work, work which could be
done more efficiently by electricity.
LET ELECTRICITY DO THE WORK. ENJOY MORE LEISURE HOURS.
The modem home provides plenty of places for electric-lighting fixtures; ample provision for the
convenient use of electric labor-saving appliances.
Convenience outlets (places to attach lamps, table appliances, vacuum cleaners, irons, etc.) cost
very little in comparison with the comfort and satisfacton they afford. If you are buying an old or
new house insist that it is fully equipped for the proper use of electric service.
To do it electrically means more recreation, less fatigue.

On the Operation Table.
Borne quickly to the operation room
I lay, life ebbing from my tortured frame,
With spirit brilliant as a furnace flame,
Keen watching an impenetrable gloom
Whereon, 'as ’twere a curtain lights illume,
In ever-changing rbles an actor came
And went on deeds of evil, and the same,
Whatever character he did assume,
Was ever I myself. My spirit sank
Stricken by swift remorse and knowing
well
Such memories had a brotherhood in Hell.
With full submission to the Eternal Will,
With no defence and guilty I lay still
I smelt a strange, sweet pungent fume and —
blank !

ARTHUR ALBERT BAYLDON.
The Haunted Glen.
Through brakes of fading bracken
The fox slips to the sea;
The brown hare in the heather
Brushes the hollow tree.
What longing draws me hither,
O heart of me?
There’s none to pick the rowans
Or stir the moss-stained stone;
But the banshee crying, keening,
By the river-bed alone,
Her scarlet cloak a-shining,
Her red hair blown !
There were four white-winged changelings
Swung down towards the sea !
Oh, swans above the river.
The past is back with me !
Along the Moyle’s wild waters
What wonders be!
On. on through all the night-time,
Their blhck feet, pair on pair,
Their wings like sails a-beating
A-beating down the air!
Their song still fills the dark glen
With music rare.
Their song is in the dark glen
Where the. rushes never stir,
And the crying of the white swans,
The singing swans of Lir,
Has caught me in its sorrow
And made me prisoner!
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.
The City.
Here where a thousand feet,
The tasks of the day begun,
Walk in tile gilded street.
Breathing the sweet of the sun
And a music the airs have caught,
I can hear a great heart beat,
For the city lies warm on my thought.
Surely these stones are kin
To the winds and the stars and sea;
Surely these swift wheels spin
On for the love of me
And the love of all things kind
- With the will to serve and be free!
Oh, the city is fair in my mind!
Here is there shelter and rest,
And a peace that ever falls
When the red sun deep in the west
Throws fire on the western walls
Ere the dusk to my spirit calls
With a magic that has no name.
Here where ten thousand feet,
Sad in the glitter of rain,
In a restless scrape and beat,
Tread the flagstones to pain,
I feel that an evil thing
Lies low on the roofs that complain
To the beat of its awful wing.
Smothering under the dark,
Slow to move and to breathe,
Life in a torment lies stark ;
And a fret and a discord seethe
As the darkness breaks apart
With the haggard lights that wreathe
Serpent-like round my heart.
Place of my love and my fear,
Shall the wings of your dreams arise
And make in some golden year
Streets in the sunlit skies?
Or shall the weight of your stone
Press on my hope till it lies
Living....and dead....and alone?

DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
The Midnight Moon.
A golden bowl, the waning July moon
Held midnight like a dark and frothing
drink
That overflowed in scattered flakes of cloud
Above the notching roofs. A shivering girl,
With powdered cheeks and heavy-lidded eyes
And carrying in her arms a red balloon,
Flitted, a phantom by the ragged hedge.
Then came tbe sharp, incisive shutting gate,
The click of high heels on a pebbled path,
A light in upper windows. She was gone.
A tram with swaying figures clanged and
paused,
Then grated down the hill. A motor-car,
Trailing a jest grown guttural to a laugh,
Hooted at the . serene unconscious starS;
And, on the height, an amber fruited palm
Stirred to ancestral memories of a night
Of yellow moons in the Mokattam hill£.
A great grey cat, pretending tiger trails,
Sprang o’er a gate and vanished in the hush
Of dim aisled gardens, housing butterflies
That would arise with dawn to spiral gold
Across the sun-washed blue. Somewhere a
tap
Dripped the slow doom of ineffectual tears,
The while the moon was as a bowl to me
Filled with quick life, warm, spicy, unafraid.

THE PURITY OF THE BALLOT.
In a manifesto addressed to the A.L.P. Con-
ference of 1921, Brookfield, M.L.A., de-
clared that the N. S. Wales Labor party was
controlled by a band of crooks sustained in
power by fraudulent selection-ballots, forged
union tickets being among the means em-
ployed. “Without these corrupt methods,”
wrote the senior member for Sturt, “the
vicious Tammany gang would be powerless,
as the creatures who crawl round them only
do so in the hope of having this faked postal
vote operated in their favor.” Brookfield
was shot by a crazy Russian when on his
way from Broken Hill to Sydney to attend
the Conference, and in the emotion excited
by the assassination his charges were
ignored. They were revived in 1922 by J. H.
Catts, then M.H.R. for Cook and campaign
secretary to the Dooley Government,
and included in a comprehensive indictment
of the Tammany regime, the disappearance
of Labor funds subscribed by brewers and
bookmakers and the hiring of ruffians to vote
early and often in selection-ballots being
among the multitude of counts. Without
being invited to produce his evidence Catts
was expelled the party, and at the ensuing
election he lost his seat. At the late Con-
ference in Sydney it was proved to the satis-
faction of an investigating committee that
the party had been debited with the high
cost of manufacturing “at least a dozen
ballot-boxes” with movable panels for the
insertion of dummy votes. It was a job de-
manding special skill, so the maker got a
special rate of pay, his camouflaged panel
being a joiner’s tour de force. A statement
was also made by a belatedly-righteous
M.L.C. that it had been arranged to poll
“1000 crook A.W.U. votes” in the 1920
selection-ballot for the Sydney seat in the
Leg. Assembly, and that he himself had
taken a parcel of these votes and given them
to trusty friends. As a result of the Com-
mittee’s report on these and related charges
four Labor politicians have been condemned
to the life-expulsion which two of them, at
least, helped to impose on Catts. But the
A.L.P. executive has not published the evi-
dence on which the four were adjudged
guilty, and they continue to hold office (in
two cases very high office) in important
trades unions. Whether their fellow-union-
ists consider them innocent, or take the
view that the offence imputed to them is
merely one of the humorous eccentricities of
Labor politics, has not transpired.
• • • •
Faking of ballots has been discussed as if
it concerned the Labor party only and were
peculiar to Sydney and a few other N. S.
Wales towns. But it is improbable on the
face of it that the knowledge of this useful
art is confined to a small corrupt group
with its headquarters in a city office, or
that the practice thereof is restricted to
Labor pre-selections. A thirst for impart-
ing information—especially when there ia
something to be gained and little risked —•
is a characteristic of the political animal,
and it may be accepted as a moral certainty
that the old masters of the business, who-
ever they are, have communicated the tricks
of their trade to choice spirits in other parts
of the Commonwealth, and that they and
their pupils have exercised their talents in
a wider field —one where the prizes are
richer and the opportunities greater, and
the chances of detection are relatively small.
Which suggests the possibility that Minis-
tries may be made and unmade by these
blackguards of the ballot, since one vote can
put a member in, and, in a condition of
affairs such as Proportional Representation
has brought about in N. S. Wales and Tas-
mania, his vote might turn a Government
out. The Daylesford (Yic.) by-election is
pertinent to these speculations. At Dayles-
ford there were three candidates, Labor,
Nationalist and Country party, and the
Labor man was declared to have beaten the
Nationalist by two votes —2138 to 2136 —
the other dropping out after the first count.
The Nationalist appealed on the ground
that some of the 138 postal votes cast for
the victor (he himself got 144 and the
Agrarian 38) were fraudulent. He had
evidence regarding 30 or 40 cases, but after
14 had been gone into the Elections and
Qualifications Committee signified that it
had heard enough, being satisfied as to the
bogusness of 10. The election was accord-
ingly upset in the Nationalist’s favor. Not
only impersonation but forgery was disclosed
in the evidence, and some of the offenders
were women. In one case a laborer was im-
personated by a tough who gave his address
as 184 Exhibition-street, Melbourne, where
the Socialist Hall abides. In another in-
stance (the same address being given) the
signature of a police-constable was forged
to the application for the vote. A second
policeman, transferred from Daylesford to
Clifton Hill, testified that he hadn’t voted,
although a vote was recoi'ded in his name.
It would be hard to imagine a more daring
bit of electoral rascality than the impersona-
tion of a policeman. Happening as it did
in a contest held within 80 miles of Mel-
bourne (and it would never have been dis-
covered but for the accident of a close poll),
it arouses curiosity as to what goes on in
the great open spaces of Westralia, where
men are not always the men they profess
to be, and in the remote electorates of
Queensland, where the State Government
has a knack of winning a majority of seats
with a minority of votes, and the propor-
tion of electors who exercise the franchise is
strangely high.
* * * *
Most of the crooked applications for
Daylesford postal votes were witnessed by
suburban councillors. One of them, Cain,
of Northcote (he is also a Labor M.L.A.),
appeared before the committee and explained
his procedure. He was quite honest about
it. “When the people came along,” he said,
“I asked them to sign their names before
me. I didn’t ask about their identity. If I
had had any doubts, of course I wouldn’t
have witnessed their signatures.” Incidentally,
the gentleman helped the committee to es-
tablish one case of fraud, and recalled in
another case that the person who claimed
the vote —that of a woman who left years
ago for another State —was “a tall, dark lady
with a black hat,” whereas the real elector,
whose name shouldn’t have been on the roll
anyhow, was a blonde. His frank and art-
less statement shows how the land lies. The
public has practically no protection against
the abuse of postal voting. What is more,
there is very little check on the honesty of
the “absent” elector. Yet voting by post
and in absence has in recent years grown
enormously: at the last election for the
House of Representatives 10,376 postal votes
were recorded and 111,022 absent votes.
These privileges provide the dishonest few
with means of defeating the purpose of the
honest many; the question therefore arises
whether they should be continued. They
should certainly pot be continued without
adequate safeguards. One such might be
found in the restoration of the old elector’s
right, with a photograph and thumbprint
added, as in passports. Were the Tam-
many voter required to produce this evidence
of bona fides, he would simply fade from
the landscape. There would be no chance
then of wangling a postal paper, or of being
Finnerty in one booth and McParritch in
another. As far as general elections are
concerned, even the strange creatures who
get their living by infesting Labor pre-
selections —the gentry to whom Smith,
M.L.C., referred when he said that “it was
arranged to get a hundred men to poll a
thousand ‘crook’ A.W.U. votes, each man
visiting 10 polling places”—would find
their frowsy occupation gone. Another
point in favor of the modernised elector’s
right is that it Would simplify the enrolment
business and save thousands of perfectly
decent people from being pursued into the
police-court because they haven’t effected
two registrations and renewed them after
every change of a ddress. At all events, it
would ensure the purity of the ballot, and
thereby frustrate the designs of a gang of
criminals who, as recent disclosures indicate,
will stop at nothing, and who are probably
more numerous than is popularly supposed.
QUEENSLAND AND THE DRINK
WAR.
In Queensland next month the citizens will
say at a compulsory poll whether they desire
(1) the total prohibition of the manufac-
ture, importation and sale of alcohol, (2)
State management, or (3) the existing sys-
tem. For purposes of practical politics, the
struggle is between prohibition and continu-
ance, the socialistic hotel having had a ruin-
ously bad advertisement in Darwin, amongst
other places. And continuance may be
almost anything that the people like to
make it. They can order hotels to
open and close at what hour seems
to them best. They can impose what-
ever restrictions they please. They can
require a certain amount of accommodation
for lodgers to go with every bar. They can
require food for 'travellers to be available at
any reasonable hour. They can do as Vic-
toria has done, and require the trade itself
to provide the means of gradually buying
out those hotels that are found to be above
the legitimate requirements of the public;
and any, such... provision means, of course,
that the worst-kept hotels are the first to
go. Continuance does not mean, then, merely
the maintenance of things as they are. It
means that the way is left open for improve-
ment in any direction that the advocates of
liquor-trade reform may persuade the public
to order. The position is a good deal like
that of a casualty in war. In the old
rough-and-ready days, if a man had a bad
wound in arm or leg, off came the limb. It
was mostly a case of amputation or nothing.
It was like that even in the eai'ly days of
the Great War. But when the medical ser-
vice was organised amputation was only re-
garded as a last resort. It was the policy
of despair. And that is precisely what pro-
hibition is. Does Queensland believe that
it has reached that point? Does it believe
that everything that is possible has been
done to reform the trade? That everything
that human ingenuity can devise has been
tried, and that everything has so completely
failed that there is nothing left but amputa-
tion? And the limb is worth keeping. Even the
prohibitionist will admit that, especially in
a country like Queensland, where much tra-
velling is necessary and where the tourist
traffic is also worth a good deal, large accom-
modation for lodgers is a necessary thing.
Admittedly, it is possible to have accommo-
dation apart from a bar; but there is this
to be remembered —with a bar certain accom-
modation can be prescribed. It can be made
a condition of the granting of a license that
not only shall meals be available, but a cer-
tain number of living-rooms shall be provided.
If this can be insisted upon apart from
liquor licenses, the plan has not yet heen
disclosed.
• • • >
On the other side there is the question of
enforceability. Canada has tried prohibition ;
and one after another the provinces are
avowedly modifying the law. Actually they
are abandoning it, because there can be no
modification of prohibition. In theory the
U.S. have not abandoned it; in practice they
have done worse —they have settled down
to break the law and refuse to regard them-
selves as bad citizens for doing it. Mean-
time, however, money is being poured out
by the million dollars in the struggle not
to maintain the law but to maintain the fic-
tion that the law is being enforced. The worst
and most demoralising kinds of vested interests
have grown out of this condition —the thou-
sands of officials who are living on their
salaries, and the other thousands who are
living on their bribes and banking their
salaries ; the bootleggers, rum-runners, etc.,
to whom prohibition is more profitable than
many gold-mines, and the politicians, etc.,
who exist on the cant of anti-drink, as the
Hearst papers do on the cant of anti-Eng-
lishism. The working-classes, whom en-
forcement chiefly affects, are inarticulate in
proportion as they are poorly organised. The
rich can afford to treat the national policy
with derision. In States like New York
they have repudiated it openly, while else-
where the acquisition of alcohol is merely
a matter of being willing and able to pay
for it. As an institution, prohibition in
America bears an interesting resemblance
to Europe’s League of Nations. Its ideals
are of the highest; so towering, in fact, as
to be doubtfully attainable. And it imposes
its will only on those who are too weak and
generally insignificant to take any action
of their own.
* * * *
When an awkward international problem
confronts the League of Nations that body
can always do nothing in a graceful manner,
and suffer no great loss of prestige. But an
Australian Government which gets a man-
date to enforce what thousands have been
talking of for years as “a great moral and
social principle” is required to act. If
Queensland goes dry on October 6 the Gov-
ernment which has the misfortune to be in
power in July, 1925, will be faced with a
contract bigger than the one which faced
the Fisher Government on the outbreak of
the World War. So far as the importation
of alcohol is concerned it is questionable if
the State authorities have the constitutional
power to prevent it. Assume they have, and
the situation is not appreciably brighter.
Apart from its land frontiers to two wine-
growing and beer-manufacturing States
which show no present signs of going dry,
Queensland has a coast-line of 2000 miles.
The U.S., whose coast-line is far smaller rela-
tively to the size of the population, have a
big unemployed navy available for police
work No Australian State could expect the
R.A.N. to help in the enforcement of a purely
State enactment. America has a mercantile
marine which it is able to drastically con-
trol outside, as well as inside, U.S.A. terri-
torial waters; and the national trade is so
important that foreign ships prefer to con-
form to the prohibition laws, however un-
reasonable, rather than betake themselves
elsewhere. Queensland depends more on its
overseas shipping than the overseas shipping
does on Queensland. America has more
money than any nation ever had before;
Queensland has none to throw away; loans
to the tune of £30,000,000 are falling due
for conversion in the next few years, and
the last purpose for which the already dis-
illusioned London lender may be expected
to advance more-, money is for prohibition
enforcement —a policy which Britain
scorns, and which is prejudicial to one of
the U.K.’s biggefet industries. Without any
intensive temperance campaign Queensland
is growing steadily soberer, if the official
figures dealing with convictions for drunken-
ness signify anything; it is drinking less
(£4 12s. 3d. per head last year as against
£4 19s. 2d. the year before), and its hotels
are decreasing in number and improving in
quality. In other words, there is no urgent
need for the State to plunge into this gigan-
tic struggle—a venture which was appa-
rently a blunder even on the part of
America, but which in the case of a social
unit so feebly-equipped for the work as an
Australian State would amount to an act of
criminal lunacy.
UNCLE SAM’S NEXT PRESIDENT.
[Mr. Skeyhill wrote this just before the death of
President Harding. ]
Befobe the war the name of Henry Fokd
was more or less a joke all over the civilised
world, and was always associated with
loose nuts, rattling tin and cheap upholstery.
This was as much his own as the public’s
fault, for one of the duties of his publicity
department was to coin and circulate gibes
about the Ford and its maker. From the
standpoint of advertising this was excellent,
for it kept the Ford constantly before the
public; but it was a double-edged blade
which cut at the personality and dignity of
Henry Ford. And so before the war nobody
really took Henry Ford seriously. This
was particularly the case in the U.S.A.,
where everybody rode in his automobile, and
joked and “joshed” about the idiosyncrasies
of the commercial vaudevillian who made 1 it.
Then came the war and the fiasco of the
“Peace Ship.” A less courageous soul would
have sunk out of sight under the broadside of
jeers which were poured into him at that
time, when a world grown: blind to reason
snarled and killed and destroyed in the
greatest frenzy of savagery man has known.
Ford did not sink, but he came home from
that trip a previously; unsuspected patriot.
When his country entered tne list of the
combatants there was no doubt at all of his
Americanism. He swept pacificism out of
his brain, and started to turn out muni-
tions with the same dynamic energy and
success which characterised his automobile
production in the pre-war days. From the
first the vast resources of his great indus-
trial organisations were at the disposal of
Uncle Sam; and his contribution to the
Allied victory was as great as that of any
other American industrial genius. He built
tractors and sent them to England to plough,
“lest street-bred people die” ; and shells, sub-
marine chasers, mines, trucks, ambulances,
touring cars, etc., poured from his factories
until the Armistice was signed.
It was at this time that the American pub-
lic commenced to see the real Ford. They
began to realise that underneath the comic
advertising there was a master-mind which
had assembled the most perfectly-tuned indus-
trial organisation in all history, and in
the houir of peril had le;apt into
the breach and led the industrial
forces of the country as coolly and suc-
cessfully as Foch or Pershing had led the
fighting forces in the field. His personal
stock has been on the up-grade ever since,
until to-day he is the most discussed Presi-
dential candidate in America; and if the
elections were held to-morrow I believe he
would be sent to the White House with an
overwhelming plurality. The “world spins,”
as Villon said. If he is available Warren
Harding will again lead the Republican
party to the polls, and make a great fight
for the second term in the White House.
Hoover and Hughes stand next to him in
the party’s regard. On the Democratic
side William Gibbs McAdoo, the capable
son-in-law of Woodrow Wilson, is the likeli-
est party’s choice; and it looks at present as
if Harding could defeat McAdoo. But there
is the possibility of an uninvited Banquo’s
ghost attending the political feast— Ford.
The Washington correspondent of the inde-
pendent Detroit News succinctly presents
Ford’s strength:—
He is distinctly the first new man of first political
rank to appear on the horizon since domestic politics,
the world over, entered its period *of doldrums with
the World War. He is the best-advertised man in
America. He is peculiarly the star product of
twentieth-century American life, who has eclipsed,
singlehanded, the work of his industrial predecessors,
Rockefeller, Carnegie, Frick, without attracting to
himself any of the stigma of great wealth which
attached to those others. With the same hand with
which he has taken great wealth from the mass of the
people, he has made himself the champion of these
same people against what they regard as the prevailing
evils of the industrial system. He is the disciple
of the great Middle West as against the Eastern Sea-
board, the recognised crusader against the money-
changers at Wall-street. His primary political
appeal is that he is something different. He comes
from outside the established realm of politics. For
20 years he has been running contrary to the ortho-
dox methods of industry with unparalleled success.
His political strength to-day lies in the hope which
he presents of a similar upheaval and rebuilding of
the machine of government.
But the road to the White House is not
a primrose path, and Ford has an extremely
powerful and militant opposition, made up
principally of Wall-street bankers, machine-
politicians, ultra-Conservatives and Jews, all
determined to keep him away from the Presi-
dency, They never lose an opportunity to
ridicule him as one who would fit into the
White House as beautifully as a mad bull in
a china shop. This opposition is made vocal
by Mr. Villard, in the Nation. Referring
to the increasing belief that Ford" can head
the Democratic ticket and win, or even suc-
cessfully lead a Third Party, he writes: —
If either contingency should come to pass....it
might readily bring about the complete collapse of
our governmental machinery, which is steadily sagging
to the breaking point. It would be the triumph of
the unfit; it would probablv be the final attempt Hi
American political life to fill the Presidency on the
theory that an American, no matter what his educa-
tion, his experience, his talent or his knowledge, is
equal to the job of solving the multitude of complex
problems that sometimes make it questionable


whether any man can he found with all the qualifica-
tions essential to a successful President of the
United States.
Somewhere in between the two opinions we
will find the real Ford strength. He has
the wage-workers, the farmers and the pro-
gressive business men behind him the
workers know that he has never hud any
trouble with his employees, and that he is the
first and the only big employer in the world
to bring in the “seven-hour” and. “six-dollar-
minimum” day ; the farmers see in his cheap
tractors and fertilisers a chance to lift them-
selves out of the drudgery and heart-breaking
toil which have been theirs for so long; the
business men are all sick of politicians
bungling and interfering with the business
affairs of the country—they want more busi-
ness in government, and less government
in business. This line-up of workers, farmers
and progressive business men is a strong one,
and if it was only a question of votes Ford
would sweep the country like a whirlwind.
But the political aspirant must wade through
a lot of mud) and grime before he can get
before the people over here. The party
leaders, the political bosses, the wire-pullers
have to be defeated or won over before the
candidate can get to the voters. And is
where Ford is certainly up against it. For
his opponents, although in the minority,
occupy the premier strategic positions. _Of
course, if he gets the Democratic nomination,
it. will simplify matters —he will go trium-
phantly into the White House. But there
is a big “if” about the Democratic nomina-
tion. The Democrats have other plans. They
favor McAdoo, or Smith, or Cox, or
Edwards, or Underwood. And while they
think they have a chance of winning with
any of these “good Democrats,” they will
stick to them. But if they clearly see the
Republican nominee too strong for any of
them, then there is just a chance that they may
make Ford the Democratic standard-bearer.
Certainly if they have any sense they will
do this, for then he would sweep everything
before him, including the entire Democratic
ticket.
TOM SKEYHILL.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Repudiation Point.
N. S. Wales Treasurer Cocks spoke as an
aggrieved man when, starting to put his
Budget together, he said that he had to find
£700,000 more than last year for interest on
the State debt (none of it war debt), and
that the mental strain was beginning to tel).
This means that the interest bill will be
over £9,000,000 —and no more than, £2,430,000
sufficed in 1901. Three things are due to
happen to the Ma State shortly. (1) The
total debt will reach £200,000,000. (2) The
rate of interest will reach 5 per cent. (3)
The year’s interest bill will touch
£10,000,000, which is more than the whole
expenditure amounted to in 1901. It occu-
pied N. S. Wales 48 years (1842-1890) to
acquire its first £50,000,000 of debt. It
took only 22 years to cover the second lap
(£100,000,000). That brought the record to
1912. The £150,000,000 mark was attained
late in 1919 or early in 1920 (say years) ;
and £200,000,000 should be arrived at in
the latter half of 1924, only between four
and five years being required for this last
effort. The interest bill grows even faster
than the debt, through the falling due of
cheap loans, for which no Treasurer made
provision with a sinking fund, and their
renewal in a dear market at the other fel-
low’s price. When £29,650,000 is renewed
next year at the other fellow’s price it is
expected to give the interest bill a further
large lift. Every State has an old bill faff-
ing due in 1924, the total being £52,268,000,
end the Commonwealth has one also of
£20,375,000. In the year following that
£106,000,000 falls due. The harried Premier,
struggling to lengthen the monetary garment
by cutting off the tail and fastening it to
the head, is credited with a scheme for sub-
sidising the State’s railways out of new
State taxes, so that the losses which have
been bought with the new loans may appear
on a different page of the ledger. Some
good might be achieved by a device of the
sort if it was done on an heroic scale. Sup-
posing the whole of the interest bill which
is not met by the yield from “per-
manent and reproductive works” was
raised by a separate income-tax with a
very small exemption, so that it would
reach the multitude, and the assessment-
paper had printed on it in large type
“Public Debt Tax,” it would at least have
an enlightening effect. And this country
seems shorter of enlightenment than of
almost anything else. It knows the betting
odds fairly well; but it seems to be quite
unaware that we are piling up debt nine
times faster than we did prior to 1890,
though that period included most of the land
and borrowing boom which wrecked all but
four of tbe banks ,in Australia. Further
we have undertaken to pay back the millions
without having either the millions in hand
or any arrangements for borrowing them.
In short, we have delivered ourselves bound
into the hands of the money-lender; and in-
stead of making the least effort to extricate
ourselves—which is a matter mainly of hard
economy and thrift, public and private—our
politicians buy monetary benefits for them-
selves, and throw us further into the tangle.
There is a point at which it becomes hope-
less. Many a South American and a few
European countries have reached that point.
It will be a degrading experience for a Brit-
ish community to do it. Yet the Federal
Treasurer’s experience with the renewal of
the loan falling due on the 15th inst. is a
solemn warning that we are perilously near
the point.

The Land of Eternal Waiting.
“Even though as far as climate is concerned there
is nothing to prevent the immediate settlement of
the North, it may have to wait until tthe more
temperate and accessible Darts of Australia are
filled.”—S. M. Herald 29/S/’23.
Such was the finish of a typical and care-
fully-balanced lucubration on “Tropical
Settlement,” the general tendency of which was
that the definite taking possession of Empty
Australia (which is about three-fourths of
Australia) can wait, whether the hungry
peoples who have an eye on this last great
vacant and desirable area in a crowded
globe are disposed to wait or not. Along-
side was an article on “Moving to Can-
berra,” the gist of it being that the business
of shifting the seat of Australia’s govern-
ment a lot nearer to the S. M. Herald pre-
mises is something that oari’t wait. It was
impossible, of course, for such a body as the
Pan-Pacific Congress to meet in Australia
without someone asking whether it is pos-
sible for the white man and woman to live
and work and thrive in the tropics, on which
subject intelligent Australians know a great
deal more than the learned scientists, and
more than the majority of the globe’s
inhabitants. When it is raised “moderate”
local-minded persons and “serious” local-
minded papers invariably take up a waiting
and meditative attitude, and recommend that
nothing be done rashly. This is presumably
lest money should be spent iiv large con-
tinental doings which might otherwise be
available for jobs in the next alley. That
would have been the attitude of Ferdinand
and Isabella if they had refused to finance
the Columbus American expedition, and re-
served the money for possible repairs to the
kitchen-tap. What Australia knows about
its North can be summed up in a few simple
propositions, Queensland is the most north-
ern State, and the only one with a suffi-
ciently long-settled white working popula-
tion to be a test. Its death-rate in 1921
was the lowest and in 1922 the third lowest
among the States. It is always below the
average, and always below those of the two
most southern States. In the absence of any
other explanation, this has been accounted
for on the theory that living in the tropics
is healthy, provided they are clean tropics
and not packed with a poor and insanitary
colored population. The birth-rate of the
great tropical State is much above the Com-
monwealth average, for the same healthy
reason which makes the death-rate below
it. Australia requires no learned book-
worms from afar to debate about the suit-
ability of the Australian tropics for white
settlers, any more than it wants them to
go into t:lie matter of the suitability of the
sea for fish. The disaster of fertile tropi-
cal Australia is that it is governed by absen-
tee Parliaments, just as fertile Ireland used
to be, only, the distances being longer and
the absentee rulers mostly a worse lot, the
position is aggravated. It is a suggestion
typical of the parish-beadle mind that the
rich, well-watered North, where the fate of
Australia lies, should wait till the colder and
less fertile and “more accessible” parts are
“filled.” The South is fairly accessible, includ-
ing even the Nullarbor Plains, where there is
neither tree, water nor population for 300
miles, because it has been made accessible
by railways and other costly means; but the
attitude of parochialism to a place like the
Northern Territory is to wait till railways
grow providentially there. At the same time
the idea of leaving Canberra to grow and
develop by the fostering care of Providence
is seldom heard of. The date always fixed
by petrified Big City interests for going out
into the open spaces and having a look at
Australia’s destiny is really that mentioned
by the Herald —when the South is filled.
The County of Cumberland, where the
Herald’s office and its soul are located, had
633 persons to the sq. mile on census day,
and it has more now, but apparently it isn’t
full enough even yet to justify a little atten-
tion being diverted to the Commonwealth’s
great property in the North, and other out-
side matters.

The Divagations of Lawson and Co.
Lawson, Victoria’s record long-distance Pre-
mier, wandered out of office and wandered
in again with a slightly different team, but
with the inevitable Peacock, who, like Bent
in bygone days, goes on for ever. Presum-
ably the new loan-madness has come back
also. No State could well have fallen from
a position of reasonable honesty and solvency
with a more boisterous crash than Victoria
has done in recent years. Jimmy Mitchell,
of Westralia, supplied part of the moving
force. That brisk politician discovered the
idea of big loans for settlement as something
quite new, and fixed up loan agreements with
Britain and the Commonwealth which turned
some other financiers green with envy. They
proceeded to join iii. The Commonwealth
grew so enthusiastic that it proposes to
cadge £45.000,000 per year for the next
three years, and not develop its own splen-
did North with any of it, but hand the lot
to the States to be spent in the same old
cramped corner. This was how once sane
Victoria blossomed forth in the razzle: —
Victorian Loan Expenditure.
Average per year from 1881 to 1891 .. £2,270,12S
, ~ „ 1891 to 1901 .. 755,194
’ , „ 1901 to 1911 . . 976,497
’ 1911 to 1919 .. 2.716,260
19 20 ~ .. 7,601,266
IQ2I . . .. ~ . . 11,095,158
19 22 11,804,991
The Lawson Government presumably went
mad to be in the fashion, for Victoria is the
smallest and most-densely peopled of the
mainland States, and the one with the least
need 1 to purchase settlers. Further, it was,
in 1919-20-21, the least taxed of the States,
and the one best fitted for going mad out
of revenue, if it felt that insanity was essen-
tial to its well-being. An aggravation of the
case was that all the States save Queensland
had big loans falling due almost immediately,
to be renewed in a very bad market, when the
new “settlement” and immigration graze took
them; also, the Commonwealth had a big
renewal in sight, over which it has got bogged
up to the axle. In the rush to acquire
“estates” the Governments put up the price
of land against themselves, and in the
rush to borrow money with which to
buy “estates” they put up the rate
of interest against themselves. But no-
body cared much. They bought and bor-
rowed just as Mussolini, of Italy, issues
ultimatums, because they felt that way. The
last “Victorian Year Book” contains a list of
the “estates” which the Lawson Ministry
had acquired to June, 1922. There are 91
items in the category. The largest single
property amounted to 29.567 acres and the
smallest to 11 acres, which reads more like
peddling in suburban allotments than going
baldheaded for Monopoly. Doubtless the new
policy will lead to a good deal of settlement
in Melbourne, if it does nothing else. Bigger
loan expenditure, no matter for what osten-
sible purpose, always tends that way, as wit-
ness these census figures :
Increase in Increase in Total
Yic. Metropolis. Rest of State. Increase.
1881-91 . . 207,949 70,110 278,059
1891-1901.. 5,183- 55,482 60,065
1901-11 . .- 97,158 17,323 114,481
1911-21 . . 189,742 25,987 215,729
Seeing that the loan spendings brisked up
to an average of four millions per annum
in the 1911-21 period, it was natural that
the Vic. metropolis should get a move on,
and if the borrowing pace continues tbe next
move should be even more remarkable.
“He Made the Stars Also.”
That line from Genesis has often been
quoted as a masterpiece in the way of after-
thought or postscript, and something out of
the way in the art of disproportion. The
sacred writer had already mentioned the
grass and other matters, when he suddenly
found that he had almost left out the uni-
verse. Something much the same in its
smaller way appeared in the Sydney Tele-
graph recently. It was by the most perse-
vering philanthropist of Sydney, if not of
Australia, Dr. Arthur, M.L.A., and his sub-
ject was slum life in Australia’s biggest and
most rapidly growing metropolis; also the
horrors of tuberculosis and other slum
diseases. An extract or two: —
Well-intentioned efforts, like the destruction of
a slum area, have sometimes made matters actually
worse. In Sydney, for instance, the invasion of
Surry Hills, Redfern, Chippendale and Ultimo by
stores and factories lias only aggravated the over-
crowding and unhygienic conditions of the neigh-
boring areas.
It naturally does. When instead of 12
houses on a certain area there are eight
houses and a big factory, 12 lots of people
proceed to get into eight houses somehow.
I found a man with a wife and two children
living in a cellar in Surry Hills, and I have come
across others in damp, vermin-infested rookeries
quite unfit for human habitation. What must be
the almost inevitable fate of children cooped up in
such surroundings with a parent far advanced in
consumption ?
I know of one case where four of the children were
infected, and again where three were. A girl of nine
had spent six years in public institutions and was
still suffering from disease.
The Children’s Hospital turns out each year a
melancholy procession of hunchbacks and cripples
after they have lain on their backs in plaster cases
for months or years.
Then the kindly medico-politician proposed a
few remedies, after suggesting farm villages
as refuges for consumptive families: —
The natural corollary of the demolition of work-
men’s homes to make room for a factory or similar
building should be the erection of homes for the
evicted persons elsewhere....
The lowering of workmen’s fares on the railways,
the granting of season tickets on the longer train-
way routes —a quite feasible proposition in spite of
the denial of the tramway authorities —and the
carrying out of the long-overdue decentralisation
schemes for the establishment of new oversea ports,
would all tend towards solving the slum problem of
Sydney.
It is fortunate that the last sentence got in,
else the result would have been almost as
bad as if Genesis had forgotten the universe.
It is a kindly idea to put the consumptive
family in a farm village, inasmuch as it may
save some of the children from infection. Still
it is no preventive. The family must first
be infected to oualify for the village. And
a long spell of youth in a grassy hamlet
of invalids seems no great preparation for
the battle of life. Then, even if the man
who pulls down houses to make room for his
factory is made to provide accommodation for
the evicted folk elsewhere, that doesn’t make
the slums that are not pulled down any less
crowded, nor does it prevent them becoming
more crowded owing to births and to the
influx of population from the dying provin-
cial towns. Cheaper suburban fares likewise
are a makeshift, especially in a city so
waterlocked as Sydney. However cheap they
may be, it is a weary, distasteful business to
spend two hours or more of each working
day in wandering to and fro, and many
prefer slum-dwelling. The situation which
the reformers of Australasia’s biggest city
should fix in their minds is this: —
N. S. Wales has carefully and purposely created,
in one of the world’s record empty spaces, a freak,
wen, or disgrace. This place, on the evidence of
the last two censuses, is heaping up population
more than five times faster than Liverpool, three
times faster than Birmingham, 16 times faster than
Manchester, and 65 times faster than Leeds, and
these are England's four biggest provincial cities.
It is swelling faster than the kingdom of Scotland,
faster than the County of London, faster than Greater
London itself, and it is now growing more rapidly
than all the rest of N. S. Wales put together. The
following figures regarding Sydney can be found on
page 113 of the “Official Year Book of N.S.W.”
(1921). The others are from the “Statesman’s
Year Book” (1922):
Sydney. Greater London. Scotland.
185 Sq. Miles. 693 Sq. Miles. 30,405 Sq. Miles.
1911. .629.503 7,251,358 4,760,904
1921. .899,099 7,476,168 4,882,288
Increase. .269,596 224,810 121,384
Thus Sydney is not only growing faster than
Greater London; it actually puts 1457
new people on to a square mile, while Lon-
don puts only 324. At this pace its only
prospect is to be a phenomenon of tene-
ment bouses, which are degraded flats; and
of flats, which are prospective tenement
houses. In tbe tenement houses there are
alleged to be diseased and debased children.
In the flats there are few or no children. If
anyone honestly desires to do something
large and permanent for the little cripples
and consumptives—to prevent and not merely
to potter and patch—“the establishment of
new oversea ports” should, be the first
feature and the overwhelming feature of
the programme, and not a mere postcript or
side-show. But if the new seaport towns
are to grow and relieve the pressure on the
slums and cellars of citydom they must belong
to new States, which will have a whole-
hearted interest in their welfare.

If Tanganyika Came to Australia.
A Sun cable recently summarised the 1922
report on the administration of Tanganyika.
After deploring the unedifying tactics pur-
sued by the Christian churches in their
struggle for the souls of the inhabitants—a
spectacle which naturally disposes the colored
brethren to view the teachings of the churches
with cynicism—the report goes on :
Infanticide is still prevalent. The Wapare tribe
destroy by suffocation children afflicted with the
slightest abnormality. The Waehagga and Wazigua
tribes have abandoned these abominations, and it is
hoped that the Wapare will shortly follow their
example.
It might be of assistance to the good cause
if a deputation of representative Wapare
tribesmen were despatched to a highly civil-
ised community—one of Australia’s big cities,
say—and were there shown how much
more humanely and rationally the white over-
lord deals with his race problem. In various
asylums, hospitals and homes, public and
private, the investigating savages would find
thousands of child-invalids, mostly incur-
ables. They would see imbeciles, dangerous
and otherwise; sufferers from hideous skin
diseases; blind children, deaf and dumb
children; cripples of all descriptions, and
many others dedicated to pain and misery
for the rest of their lives. It would be ex-
plained to the visitors that these unhappy
creatures were being maintained in a state
of living death out of Christian charity.
Not inconceivably the hearts of the tribes-
men might be moved at the sight of so much
suffering, and in that event, if there was a
cleric near by, they would be informed that
most of the afflicted were expiating the sins
of their fathers. Doctors would explain that
the plight of perhaps 90 per cent, of them
was due to V.D., and that this, unlike cancer,
diabetes, tuberculosis, etc., could be eradi-
cated with comparative ease. Sir James
Barr, one of Britain’s most famous physi
cians, wrote only a month or so ago:—
If we had less cant in this country and more
eommonsense, venereal disease, which is sapping the
constitution of the nation, would soon be abolished.
The doctors would also explain to the won-
dering visitors that, in addition to the child
victims of V.D., the nation supports a huge
army of degenerates who gravitate to gaols
rather than hospitals ; that V.D. has a cala-
mitous effect on the motherhood of the race,
and that directly and indirectly it greatly
prejudices the general health and physique of
the nation. Because of V.D. we have a
mostly C 3 population : without it we might
have one of those A 1 populations, in the
physical sense, which the benighted peoples
of darkest Africa have acquired by killing
off their weaklings in infancy. Having-
learned all these things, the members of the
deputation might go back to Tanganyika in
a receptive frame of mind as regards the
wisdom of the teachings of the Christian
white man on the race question. On the
other hand, of course, they might be affected
differently. In fact, it is conceivable that
a wholesale slaughter of missionaries would
follow, on the ground that the welfare of
the race called for the destruction of those
who preached such physically ruinous doc-
trines. The mind of the black heathen has
to be intensively educated, in many direc-
tions, before it is capable of rising to the
logical and humanitarian level of the Cau-
casian.

The Socially Unfit.
“M. Henry” discusses a suggested remedy:
Even the medical writer of the article on sterilisa-
tion of the socially unfit (B. 9/8/’’23) may admit
that the last and weightiest word in this matter is
not with the working surgeon or physician, or even
the alienist as such, but with the geneticist. Also
he knows that most doctors who practise their pro-
fession for a livelihood have about as much know-
ledge of genetics as they have of geology. The greatest
living English genetist, William Bateson, lays it
down that the union of the pure science of genetics
with the applied science of eugenics is as dangerous
as the marriage of spiders: one of the fertilising
partners is liable to be absorbed. The student of genetics,
according to Bateson, can find in that science not
the smallest warrant for any kind of public interference
with human propagation, except in the single case
of the feeble-minded. It is genetically certain that
the offspring of two persons of feeble mind will be
feeble-minded, and there is no question as to the
inhumanity of allowing persons of that class to
multiply their kind. But if you take one step
farther than that the genetist must leave you. The
sterilisation of habitual criminals cannot profitably
even be discussed in the present state of knowledge
of the genetics and aetiology of criminality. The
criminal who is also feeble-minded takes his place
among that class; but the one who is not so is an
ass of quite a different color bicftogically. “The
fact,” says Bateson, “that a man is classed as a
criminal tells me little as to his value, still less
as to the possible value of his offspring.” The
criminal law is based on non-biologieal data. You
cannot safely take a single eugenic' step off these
shaky grounds. And, moreover, Bateson is rude
enough to ask whether the petty pilferer, or even
the burglar, is more dangerous to the race than the
fraudulent army contractor or the munition manu-
facturer who spends thousands in fomenting the
racial and national hatreds of ignorant multitudes.
But Uncle Sam has valiantly stepped in where
Bateson fears to tread. Sterilisation has been
considered in about half the States of the Union.
Laws permitting it have been passed in 15 States.
But constitutional and political trouble was struck
at the outset; and six of these States have repealed
their laws. In three others they have been a dead
letter. Five States only have put sterilisation
laws into operation, and of these three apply them
but partially. The Courts of seven States have
declared them to be unconstitutional. In 1913 a
referendum of the electors was carried out in Oregon,
at which 53,000 voted against and 41,000 for steri-
lisation. Up to the beginning of 1921 the number
of operations actually performed in America was
3233. More than two-thirds of these were done
in California, and nearly one-third in one institu-
tion there. The law applies to criminals and the
insane, as well as to “fools and idiots,” and per-
sons serving life sentences get a double dose of
eugenics: they are sterilised as well as segregated.
The racial result of all this is, and must remain for
many years, on the knees of the gods.
The merits of sterilisation, as against those of
segregation, are discussed —not quite adequately, as
I think—in Popenoe and Johnson’s able work,
“Applied Eugenics,” published jn 1920. The
authors strongly favor segregation, which, they say,
is equally effective in the prevention of offspring.
There are three possible surgical methods of dealing
w’th the feeble-minded, but those which affect the
sex-life or impulses are now quite out of court.
“Now then,” says the advocate of sterilisation,
“we are finished with these people, and shall have
no more expense or trouble.” And he turns them
loose with the assurance that, whatever sexual
pranks it may please them to play in future, they
can never again be brought to book for the support

or the care of a child. I hazard the opinion that
we have here one of the most dangerous and dys-
genic procedures—while venereal disease is pei-
mitted, or even encouraged, to wreak its will on
the flesh and bones of humanity—that it is possible
for any community to make itself responsible for.
Is it not obvious and quite certain that a steiilised
woman of weak mind, with full freedom of move-
ment, will be a far greater danger than one not
sterilised, whose very first moral lapse would
probably land her in the safe-keeping of some
institution? The fate of the unfortunate being her-
self is too horrible to contemplate.
We are assured by the best authorities in these
matters that all the eugenic advantages of sterilisa-
tion of the feeble-minded may be secured by segre-
gation, which has, in addition, the merits of being
more humane, of giving them a chance to become
honestly self-supporting, and of withdrawing these
badlv-handicapped people from the terrible struggle
for bread. In the presence of this last considera-
tion alone, to my thinking, the theory of sterilisa-
tion, with subsequent freedom, lies dead and damned
past all praying for. Without subsequent freedom
sterilisation is useless eugenically, and unnecessary
and meaningless socially.
“Griffith Moses” : I wish the morbid verb
“cement” could be struck out of the politi-
cal vocabulary. For instance, this was
about the last heard of Bruce before he
departed with his retinue —
He wished to remain in Canada for a while in
order to discuss the reciprocal trade treaty between
that country and Australia, and he had received a
most cordial invitation to visit Washington. He
hoped to be able to accept this invitation, and to
do something to cement the friendship between Aus-
tralia and the United States.
Nobody doubts that Bruce received a cor-
dial invitation, which the Fly also received
from the United Spider. But the latest
figures (which are a year old) show that in
12 months Canada and the U.S. sold to us
£22,000,000 worth of goods and bought from
us less than £9,000,000 worth, and so they
demanded, to square the difference, over
£13,000,000 of the cash that is needed to
pay off some liabilities in England. There-
fore, what is wanted is a tariff, made and
cemented here, and without any negotiation,
which will stop this influx of goods and
outflow of hard money. That being done, it
is for the people over there to come here
and negotiate if they feel like it. Further-
more, if some sort of commercial treaty is
fixed up, which I hope will not be the case,
it should contain a very special clause not
usual in ordinary cases. When a consign-
ment of produce arrives at a U.S. port, and
there is no tariff provision to keep it out,
and yet U.S. interests want it kept , out, it
has happened that U.S. interests have “seen”
or “approached” the right person, and he has
incontinently rejected the lot as being in-
fected with * the pip or the mange or some-
thing. This is a handy device, but it is
annoying, Therefore it should be provided
that, should this oainful event happen again,
U.S. goods to the same value, consigned to
some U.S. firm here, may be seized and
thrown overboard on the ground of hydro-
phobia. Anything else would do, but
I like the sound of hydrophobia.
“0.K.”: One result of the World War, and
of the chaos that came out of it, must be
a decline in the birth-rate in those countries
which suffered most severely from war’s
horrors. Reasoning maternity must, in the
natural course of things, lose much of its
instinctive enthusiasm for the production of
sons if they are born only to be conscripted.
The old Napoleonic “guff” that a mother
with an abnormal number of male offspring
is a queen among patriots carries no weight
these times. In a steady cultivation of
cannon fodder there can be no consolation.
As long as vastly-destructive wars were in-
frequent, and individual heroism still counted
for a great deal, the old talk about the
“glorious game” fired the blood even of
women, if they didn’t hear the wings of death
flapping amidst the hot air of the patriotic
eloquence. But long-range artillery, poison
gases and the like have robbed mechanical
warfare of its last pretence of gloriousness.
The French nation, dominated by the vora-
cious ambition of Napoleon, grew so sick
of human sacrifice that birth-control became
the unwritten law of the land. Huge military
losses were more responsible than small farms
for the nation’s limitation of families. The
French madam had had a lesson which the
duller-minded German frau is bound to learn
now. Why should a woman give up the
best years of her life to the nurturing of
children whom the Government will enlist
for fighting purposes? Women might as weil
provide large families for the express pur-
pose of settling them in earthquake areas.
“Gimlet W.” has an idea: —
The trading hours in Perth and South-Westralian
bars are 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., the change from 6 a.m.
to 11 p.m. having been made by proclamation in
one of the early war years. Kalgoorlie and Boulder
were allowed to vote on the business, and decided
in favor of the old hours. Years later, when local
option came along, they polled large majorities for
continuance, although both towns are grotesquely
over-pubbed. Other districts with one hotel, and
that of a superior type, depending largely on the
travelling public, declared for reduction or no-
license, which illustrates the folly of putting these
questions to the vote. Instead of providing for a
compensation fund, the Westralian Licensing Act gave
the Trade 10 years’ immunity from local option.
At the end of that period (it expired in 1921) the
dispossessed landlord and licensee would have no
claim on the State. In a moment of exhilaration,
induced by a beverage that bubbled, a leading
hotelkeeper once held forth to me on the quixotic
generosity of this provision. “Time compensation's
all right,” he said; “I’m not objecting to that.
But what a mug the Government was not to resume
all licenses at the end of the ten years! There
would have been no hardship in this to the land-
lords, for they would have got a lot more than

resumed the properties at their freehold value,
sold the leases for what they would fetch, and, es
settlement grew and more accommodation was called
for, built a reformed type of public-house, suited to
the country. Of course it would have had to stick
strictly to the landlord part of the business and let

“Tauwarra” : The “Big City” madness
seems to be extending to Papua. Moresby,
which is situated in a dry belt producing
nothing but grievances, is about 1200 miles
from Sydney. The freight on copra be-
tween the two ports is 355. per ton. The
through freight to London on parcels of not
less than 25 tons is 100 s., a concession of
value only to producers in a big way. As
heretofore the small man is compelled to
sell his produce to the Moresby “grocers” at
whatever price they care to pay. Iverema,
which is the centre of the richest cocoanut-
belt in Papua—probably in the Pacific —is
distant only about 100 miles from Moresby ;
yet the coastal freight to Moresby is 50s.
per ton. This part of the coast is dotted
with small plantations owned by single in-
dividuals—a class of citizen infinitely more
deserving of encouragement than big com-
panies paying tribute to absentee share-
holders. When copra was worth £3O per
ton in Moresby the small man “out west”
was not much concerned about coastal
freights. Now, when the market price has
slumped to £l2, he is carrying a load which
is slowly crushing him out of existence.
The obvious remedy is, of course, co-opera-
tion. There is an excellent all-year anchor-
age at Yule Island, ideally situated for a
central depot.
From 11. L. Penfold Hyland: The letter
from “Donald D.” (B. 16/8/’23) will,
I am sure, be endorsed by all lovers
of purity of product. For years I
have agitated the Federal Ministry to take
necessary action to prevent the vile spirit
referred to from entering the Commonwealth.
In consequence of the competition of this
nation-wrecking (so-called) brandy, ruin is
being caused among the soldier settlers on
the Murray, and, unless I am very much mis-
taken, their distillation Doradilla grapes
will not he worth more than the un-
profitable price of £2 10s. per ton during
the 1924 vintage, unless immediate and united
action is taken to prevent power alcohol
--for that is all the spirit is—from compet-
ing with the soldier-grown, pu re-grape
brandy. One river distillery already has an-
nounced that it cannot meet its obligations.
The outside public is naturally not conver-
sant with the injustice that the Australian
distiller has to tolerate. Some two years ago
Mr. David Masterton, of Victoria, inter-
viewed the Minister of Customs and placed
before him similar statements to those of
“Donald D.” The Minister suggested that
Mr. Masterton should invite a Mr. Curd,
of the London Customs, to accompany him
to France and investigate matters. The
investigation proved precisely the same facts
as revealed by “Donald D.” At a recent
deputation to the Minister of Customs, the
Australian distillers were told that Mr.
Brooks, of the Tariff Commission, was
visiting France, and “if Mr. Brooks could
put his hand on this illegal distillation busi-
ness, he, the Minister of Customs, would put
his foot on it, so far as export to Australia
is concerned.” But nothing has been done;
and the vile stuff still comes in. I appeal
to the soldier grape-growers not to “dig
themselves in” and wait for the calamity
ahead, but to come out into the open and
prove to the Australian public that not only
is it their desire, but it is also their deter-
mination, that the Australian consumer,
when asking for brandy, shall have only that
distilled from pure grape wine, whether made
in Australia or foreign countries. The
soldier spirit saved the Commonwealth; it
is up to the Commonwealth to save the
spirit of the soldiers.
“Seasheixs” : “Ooragnaic” (B. 2/8/’23)
says the Federal Government might do a
lot better for some of the old-age pensioners
than giving them a few extra shillings a
week, and suggests forming settlements of
cosy one-man huts, with a caretaker and,
if possible, a nurse in charge. All that
has been suggested by “Ooragnak,” and
more, has been done by Queensland for its
indigent aged men and women, and yet it
is doubtfully appreciated. There is nothing
that upsets an old person more than the
death of another old person, particularly
when it is a friend or acquaintance, and in
asylums for the old, such as Dunwich, there
is always somebody dying. Some idea of
how the old people feel on this point may
be gathered from a remark I once heard.
“When someone dies,” said an inmate of Dun-
wich to me, “I feel like clearing out —into
the bush, anywhere, so long as I get away
from it all.” It is but natural that the old
should want to mix with the living, but com-
munity settlements for the old are nothing
more or less than collective dying-grounds.
“Saaeoi” : Closer settlement and million-
farm schemes are all right provided (a)
the right land is chosen at reasonable prices
for experienced persons who possess capital
of their own equal, in every case, to at least
one-third the value of the land settled; (6)
the million farmers have either a 50-million
population to supply at hand, or else near-
by ports, through which a great export trade
may be built up at a minimum cost of haul-
age. Failing in these things, land settlement
will bungle along until the costs reach the
sky, or until landseekers refuse to touch
any Government scheme. The latter, I sus-
pect from certain signs, will shortly occur;
for, of course, the occasional rush of specu-
lators to acquire one or two exceptional
blocks in a ballot means nothing at all.
Planting wheat-settlers in dry, remote sheep-
country (and pushing the profitable merino
into the desert in the process) is one form
of closer-settlement lunacy, and can have
only one ending. The same ending, only
more so, awaits the new settler who is in-
structed to grow prunes, or asparagus, or
something like that, on a spot that is 400
miles from a market, and which is, at the
best, wheat-country, anyway. He may grow
the other things, but, dammit, what’s the
use of just growing them!
“Flicker” : All very well for the debating
societies of two Australian universities to
stage a trial of tongues on the proposition
“that the Northern Territory be handed over
to Japan in return for the payment of our
national debt.” But the next thing will be
the press of the world announcing—with its
peculiar genius for starring idiocies —that
an Australian university actually advocated
the handing over of Commonwealth terri-
tory to an Asiatic Power. No doubt the
debate represented a “purely academic dis-
cussion” (so I was' blandly informed by
member of the committee), and Australians
who think of their universities merely as
places from which every year a fresh lot of
raw doctors and half-baked lawyers emerge
to prey on the community, will smile toler-
antly and dismiss the item. But other coun-
tries do not know that the Australian uni-
versity is merely a glorified high school, and
at present there is an influential delegation
of Japanese nobles and merchants touring
this country. Will they find nothing but
what is humorous in the reflection that at a
gathering of the representatives of the seats
of learning in Australia, a question of ceding
a portion of our country to them was not
only mentioned, hut actually affirmed, and
that by the most northerly State in the Com-
monwealth? I wonder.

The Bulletin
As Deputy-Rubber Stamp for Vic., Ice-
berg Irvine had his first experience last week
of bowing out one Cabinet and ushering
in another. To save the faces of the men
to be discarded for Cockies and metropolitan
Liberals, Lawson technically made a clean
cut by resigning and starting afresh.
Neither Prendergast, Opposition Labor-
leader, nor John Allan, the Cocky group
leader, was able to show his Ex. that he
should be given a commission, so Lawson
got the top job again. Irvine can now
claim to have commissioned the champion
reconstructor —the man Who has had close
on 30 colleagues.
Farmer Allan’s alliance with Lawson and
his Victorian Liberals is the fourth such
agreement the Cockies have made, and the
third in 13 months. Willmott began it with
Lefroy in Westralia, six years ago; then
came Blyth’s arrangement with Hayes, of
the Speck (August, 1922), and Earle Page’s
with Bruce (February; 1923). The N. S.
Wales, Queensland and S. Australian groups
still remain aloof, but circumstances will
compel them to go the way the others have
gone. It is their manifest destiny. They
can achieve nothing but mischief by remain-
ing in moody isolation ; better to become a
responsible partner in the business of govern-
ment, with a first-class chance of becoming
the predominant partner and eventually
running the whole concern. Certainly a
whole lot better for the country.
Bruce, being farewelled in Adelaide, had
the one point outstanding between S.A. and
the Commonwealth urged on him once more.
Cohen, Mayor of the city, held a reception, at
which he hinted at the North-South railway
grievance. “I know all about what S.A.
thinks in this matter,” Bruce replied, and
went on:—
1 have stated publicly and emphatically that the
Government recognises the obligation it is under to
S.A. to build that line. I have never qualified that
in any way. The Government is prepared to stand
up to the obligation. But the position is that a new
Government coming into office is not to be stampeded
into doing things until it has had the opportunity
of considering and determining when is the right,
moment to take action.
It isn’t calculated to make S. Aus. think
much more highly of Bruce. A railway i 1
Certainly. A contract? Certainly. But
time—is that mentioned in the bond? And
of course all S. Aus. can do is to reply that
it isn’t —that when it dealt with a Deakin it
made the mistake of forgetting that some
day it might have to deal with a Bruce.
“Our deficit would not be what it is but
for our sinking fund,” Westralian Premier
Mitchell groaned in his Budget speech.
When the Government goes a-borrowing to
London, the sinking fund, due to the fore-
thought of John Forrest, is a trump card.
Groperland can throw out its chest and draw
attention to the fact that, alone of all the
States, it is setting aside enough to meet its
loans when they mature. But it is a dif-
ferent matter in Perth when a Premier is
busy explaining why expenditure has been
allowed to outrun income during the last 10
years by nearly six millions. The sinking
fund becomes the scapegoat then. It is a
burden to be cursed, not a distinction to
boast about. Westralia is like a person w T ho
puts a bit into the savings bank every week
but doesn’t pay the baker or the butcher, anu
expects to be simultaneously applauded, for
his thrift and condoled with over his indi-
gence.
James Dooley’s contribution to the no-confi-
dence debate in N. S. Wales Assembly was
mainly an attack on proportional represen-
tation. Said the man who was Premier for
six months: —
In three years we have had two elections. From
one our party did not come back with a working
majority. We were, therefore, not in a position to
govern properly. This Government came in with a
party of 42, and is practically in the same position
as we were. If it faced the country again to-
morrow it would still be in the same position.
And Dooley is quite right. We have got
proportional representation outside the
House, but not inside. We have devised a
system which tends to prevent any party
having an absolute majority; and we per-
sist in a Parliamentary system which de-
pends upon one crowd being able to com-
mand an absolute majority. Either pro-
portional representation must go or our
present system of choosing Ministries must
be altered.
TAKING IN THE MAT.
“Dr. Page announces that the Commonwealth Loan to provide for War Loan Renewals has been under-
subscribed by £10,000,000, and he may be driven to raise the balance in London. It is anticipated that
the terms for such an issue will be less favorable to Australia than those obtainable a few months ago.”
From the Federal Gallery:—
Bruce had his crisis as well as Lawson. It all
happened over the Old Age Pensions Bill. The Gov-
ernment reckoned that the finances wouldn’t stand more
than another 2s. 6d. a week, but various Nationalists
maintained that ss. was a fair thing, several declaring
in caucus that they were pledged to it. A count of
heads revealed that the Bruce-Pages would be four
down in a division, and knees began to quake when
Bruce was cynically reminded of the £1,300,000
he was prepared to forego in the matter of lease-
holders’ taxation. For two hours he wrestled with
the recalcitrants, and only overcame them by a
threat of resignation. The number of jelly-fish in
the subsequent division made the House look like
an aquarium.
The reason assigned for a strike on the
Queensland Government’s pilot boats, dredges,
etc., was that the Government pays the worst
wages on the coast. Queensland, now in its
ninth year of “advanced Labor” government,
is still the place where the artisan gets the
record small share of the value of
his output, chiefly because the tax-col-
lector takes so much, and a great deal of
the rest is wasted. The factory-worker is
generally on as good a wicket as anybody,
and this is what he gets out of every £l9O
by the very latest figures:—

Other things may come and go, but Theo-
dore’s mismanaged State can always be
found in the same old place—at the foot of
the wage-list.
A tragedy of unscientific taxation: —
Moved by the fact that the Westralian gold out-
put, which used to be worth £8,500,000 p.a., slumped
to £2,286,000 last year, and by the probability of
a further slump this year, Premier Mitchell has
promised the Kalgoorlie mineowners a reduction of
£40,000 p.a. in water charges. This, he says, has
been made possible by the sinking fund on the late
John Forrest’s water scheme; it now stands at
£2,741,000, and the scheme cost just £591,000
more. Forrest started both scheme and sinking fund,
and made the latter fool- and pirate-proof. It is one
of his titles to lasting remembrance. Where he and
his successors erred was in letting the mineowners
off with a 5 p.c. dividend duty when they were
rooting out high-grade ore and having the time of
their lives. For 15 years at least the Golden Mile
companies could have well afforded a 10 p.c. duty.
Also, they owed the State something for renewing
their leases as they fell in, which consideration was
foolishly thrust on them as a free gift. When the
war came, and with it high prices and taxes, they
had got down to mining low-grade stuff. That was
the time when they would have valued cheap water,
and had their profits been properly taxed in the fat
years it could have been given to them. Now their
industry is in such a condition that they have de-
spairingly applied to the Commonwealth Government
for exemption from income-tax. Which signifies that
Mitchell’s concession amounts to too little and, in
some cases at least, has come too late.
The Adelaide Steamship Co. got a set-back
in the Federal Arbitration Court the other
day, when his Honor the Deputy President
decided “it had not shown that it would be
difficult or impracticable to carry on its busi-
ness without more apprentices,” wherefore its
application was dismissed. When his Honor
was indentured to the law, was it shown
that it would be difficult or impracticable for
the Victorian Courts to carry on without
more apprentices? If such a showing had
been necessary his Honor would probably
have been shut out, and might be doing odd
jobs about an Eaglehawk mine in his declin-
ing years.
Unless cold feet supervene at the last
moment, N. S. Wales will follow the example
of Maoriland and enact that its marriage cer-
tificate is good, valid and sufficient, however
religiously mixed the parties may be. Also
that whoever denies! the fact, and tells the
parties that they are “living in sin” for the
lack of his particular sect’s blessing and per-
mit, shall go to gaol if the fine is not forth-
coming. No Government can in decency do
less than uphold the validity of its own title.
But it should be a case of the Federal power
upholding the validity of the Federal mar-
riage certificate.
S.A. Premier Barwell has rushed to the
breach with a statement that if the North-
South railway contract isn’t fulfilled volun-
tarily “there is an alternative.” Which sug-
gests that a good time is coming for those
who specialise in Costs on the higher scale.
Barwell, of course, is a barrister and a pretty
shrewd one. Another political barrister,
Latham, M.H.R. for Ivooyong, has given an
opinion that the Deakin-Price agreement is
a live contract which can be enforced.
“Galleryman’s” account of it: —
Though Premier Lawson didn’t exercise his free
and unfettered will in the selection of his new team —
Allan saw to that—he had his own way in the case
of Dr. Argyle. It, was rumored in the lobbies that
the metropolitan Liberals were to be punished for
their perversity by being ignored ; but Lawson didn’t
want a dissatisfied squad breathing destruction on
his flank. He was obliged to give them recognition,
and the only billet available was the Chief Secretary-
ship. Eggleston should have had the post. But
the man from St. Kilda had been in the van of the
attack on the Government trenches, and he had to be
disciplined. So Victoria gets the X-ray expert, a
man of fine war service and great social tonnage,
but of no particular aptitude for Ministerial service.
“Aussie”: “Old Labor Campaigner” (B.
30/S/’23) is wide of tb e mark. W. F. Dunn
was rejected for the leadership of the
N.S.W. Labor party for one reason only—
he was known to be a follower of Bailey,
M.L A. Certainly he saw war service (he
was at one time officer in charge of a
provision dump) ; but, then, we haven’t made
a Priminister of Harry Murray or State
Premiers of McCarthy and Jacka.
“Gallery”: The only man who sat uncon-
cerned by the recent uproar in the Vic.
Assembly is the gnarled Jimmy McLachlan,
Independent Laborite for Gippsland North.
That well-respected battler has no trouble in
formulating his policy, because it is mainly
Reafforestation. The other day he switched
the limelight on to it unexpectedly. In the
University Bill debate he suddenly moved
that one of the members of the council should
be a forestry expert. It seemed doomed to
defeat on the voices, but he gamely called for
a division, and it looked as if he would be
his own teller, till, at the last moment,
Tommy Ryan, of Essendon, who is always
dashing forward in support of forlorn hopes,
crossed over and sat with the enthusiast.
However, McLachlan didn’t mind defeat —he
had made a demonstration in favor of his pet
subject, which, in the eyes of the Govern-
ment, is about on the level of a close season
for prawns.
N.S.W. Railway Commissioners received
another bump from the motor-lorry opposi-
tion the other day, when the first load of
perishables was sent from Bathurst to Syd-
ney. It consisted of four tons of cauliflow-
ers ; and a consignment of some such pro-
duce will now be made weekly. The Com-
misioners’ only hope seems to lie in enter-
ing the motor-lorry business, themselves, and
feeding the railways w’itli their own services.
Russia has found, as other countries did
before it, that a currency with no strong
gold reserve behind it, but otherwise “secured
on all the public and private assets of the
community,” tends to be waste paper, though
Australia has Labor freaks who can’t see
the point yet, being impervious to history.
It is therefore proposed to start a new note
issue with a gold reserve to keep it from de-
teriorating, and (if the gold reserve can
be found) the Imperial Bank will issue the
new currency to people who have land, houses
or goods to mortgage in exchange. But
people who want to buy new currency with
old will be laughed at, just as in a few
months those who hold German paper marks
will be. In fact, for practical purposes, they
are being laughed at now, seeing that it takes
a sackful of them to buy a sausage. One
small German paper which comes to this
office now carries postage stamps which prior
to the war represented £l7.
It was on a cold, dull winter day, when
Melbourne was realising that the South Pole
is a poor breakwind, that Senator Grant,
whose religion is fresh air, announced his
fear of insufficient ventilation in Canberra
Parliament House. Canberra’s lowest record
is 18deg., which is 18deg. below Sydney’s
worst, and 9deg. below Melbourne’s bitterest.;
so Grant’s demand for plenty of icy blast
fell flat. ,

Warwick! It brings me memories, fair spot,
Of dairies where the separators swish.
You should have seen the butter that I got
That day when, bluey up and tired and hot,
I struck it first. Upon no lordly dish
’Twas borne, like that on fainting Sisera pressed
By treacherous Jael, the Kenite lleber’s wife,
Before she woodened out her warrior guest;
A' saucer held it, or a plate at best ;
But how my heart leaped up within my breast
When 1 perceived, beside the stuff, a knife
To cut it with —I that for many a moon
Had scooped such tack from bottles with a spoon!

You sent my fancies back to boyhood’s trai.s
Where market-girls with baskets on their arms
Came swinging briskly down from hillside farms
To. Aberystwith and Llandudno, Wales.
Man of the Hour 1 broke upon you there
Travelling de luxe and not on plodding leg,
And when I took the rostrum in the square,
Hard by where butter held such relish rare
Aforetime, came a-soaring through the air
For tribute to my rhetoric an egg,
Leaving behind my head a token mural
Of industries essentially rural.

’Twere meet they greet me with a pound of cheese.
So I shall murmur that refrain historic

Expenses are relatively heavier than they
were in pre-war years, but all the troubles
brought about by larger and more compli-
cated taxation and increased costs _ in a
dozen other directions have been blessings in
disguise for the trust cos.: the same set of
troubles w T as responsible for many estates
being passed into their care by private trus-
tees, and even by principals, who had wearied
of the complications of taxation and the
risks attaching to the abnormal period.
Though the work of trustee cos. has become
heavier and much more costly, commissions
based on their long-standing scale of charges
have paid them handsomely; larger
capital values and higher interest-earn-
ings have assisted revenue. The pub-
lished accounts do not take credit for
all the commissions received in any year.
The disclosed profit for the past 12 months
was £3S9O less than the figures in the intro-
ductory table. That amount was the net
addition to a “commission reserved account,”
representing portion of the first, or corpus,
commission received from new business
which cannot be regarded as having been
definitely earned until the co. has completed
the winding up of those trusts years hence.
This reserve is somewhat similar to the re-
serve of unearned premiums accumulated
by an insurance co. The £3890 was the
difference between the amount dropped in
from new estates and the portion of _ old
commissions which the management decided
it had earned, and which was extracted and
placed with cutrent revenue. The reserve
of commissions now amounts to £57,011,
but for all practical purposes it can be
treated as accumulated profit. Other visible
reserves are: £95,000 in a reserve fund;
£2500 protecting securities against market
falls; and a P. and L. balance of £3862. The
£3OOO written off was a thousand apiece
applied to reducing the book value of pre-
mises, an addition to an officers’ fidelity
fund and a vote to a staff provident fund.
For the latter £S63 was also charged directly
against revenue.

This is the Standard’s jubilee year, and cele-
brations have commenced with a 2$ p.c. bonus
from the 49th year’s operations. That makes
the div. rate 174 p.c.; but, as four years
ago capital was increased by £25,000 from
reserves, the Standard is now paying 234
p.c. on the £75,000 which shareholders put
up, and 10 points more than was distributed
half-a-dozen years ago. In all its long
life the co. has made only one free-scrip dis-
tribution, and, as it has been a very suc-
cessful underwriter, there are now funds
amounting to more than £400,000 available
for investment to help earn something for
the £lOO,OOO of capital. This is the result :
the investment department last year contri-
buted £10,655, and that was only £845 less
than was required for divs., even at the
higher rate. Consequently, nearly all the
Standard’s insurance winnings go into re-
serve: for the past 12 months £27,313 was
thus laid by. Shareholders received £17,500.
This policy has been adhered to for many
years, and has made the concern a very
powerful underwriter. Reserves in the in-
troductory table include an accumulation
of £80,500 of unearned premiums, though, on
a 40 p.c. basis, £77,565 would be sufficient
to re-insure unexpired risks. Altogether,
there were funds exceeding £402,000. equal
to 207 p.c. of last year’s net premium income,
and they were one-third larger than is gen-
erally regarded as necessary for a sound
underwriting foundation.

ing surpluses have been won: —

The features of the last year’s operations
were: (1) a loss-rate restored to normal—
in fact, it was better than that; and (2) a
lower expense ratio than for any year since
1915, The underwriting profit was 14.7 p.c.
of net premiums compared with 1915, 20.9 ;
1920, 13.1; 1921, 13.7; 1922, 9.3. But
whereas 20.9 p.c. in 1915 produced a sur-
plus of £26,459, owing to the much larger
business the past year’s 14.7 p.c. returned
£28,515. Meanwhile, no new capital has
been introduced.
The next table shows the movements of
assets since 1914 :

Mortgages were the Standard’s fancy-invest-
ments in pre-war years; but that account has
been reduced £74,885, while the tally of all
assets has expanded £211,444, Every .available
penny has gone into safer and more fluid
securities. At June 30 almost 88 p.c. of the
Standard’s balance-sheet total was repre-
sented by War Loans and other Govern-
ment and municipal lOU’s, deposits and
cash assets.

Except for one war-year, latest profits were
the best since the co. began. But though
the amount disclosed was not. far short of
12 p.c. on capital, shareholders get only their
usual 7 p.c. (£10,500), while £7341 goes into
reserves. During its 11 years’ control by a
public co. the business has required much
careful nursing; a run of bad seasons hit the
co. early in its career, and, until war prices
brought about a recovery, average profits
were less than the vendor had been making
from the big connection he had developed in
the Yic. Western districts. The average for
the six years prior to 1912 had been £13,19S
p.a. For a number of years only a small
margin of surplus profit remained after pay-
ing 7 p.c. on the public’s capital which
bought the business, and on the vendor’s
£50,000 goodwill scrip. Better profits have
permitted the directors to strengthen the con-
cern, and while £115,500 has been paid away
in divs., £40,000-odd has visibly gone into
reserve, and now all except £12,276 of the
paid capital is represented by tangible assets.
Consequently profit-earning has been made
easier, and shareholders should soon be re-
warded for their patience. Even should a
run of bad seasons be again experienced, or
market values of produce recede, Dennys,
Lascelles has developed the strength to face
whatever is coming to it much more com-
fortably than at any other time.
The next comparison shows how recent
profits were derived :

Gross earnings improved and the wages-bill
declined, and though other exes, were a little
heavier—taxes, in particular—net profits
were £2OOO better on the year. The effect
of the policy of hoarding as much profit as
possible is shown in a striking manner by
this comparison of balance-sheet figures:—

In 10 years £10,702 net has been added to
property and equipment, book debts have
grown £3732, and stocks and cash assets
have become £1233 larger. But while a
total increase of £15,667 in assets has taken
place, outside debts have declined £24,458.
The improvement has been made wholly from
earnings, paid capital having remained sta-
tionary since the flotation.

The published Profit and Loss account shows
earnings of £25,075 after paying £7137
interest on money borrowed to complete the
extensive additions made in recent years.
But besides the P. and L. surplus, balance-
sheet reserves expanded £lO,OOO on the year,
and a machinery renewal account had £1750
added. These two amounts, no doubt both
true profits, have been so included in the
entries in the introductory table. On that
basis there was a margin of £9472 of sur-
plus over and above the 6 p.c. div. on prefs.
and 10 p.c. on ordinaries. The co. may have
done even better than that; the accounts do
not disclose allowances made for deprecia-
tion, which, in view of the fact that the co.
had a good year, may have been more than
actual requirements demanded. There is no
evidence on that point. Before deducting
interest on borrowed funds, visible profits for
the two years have been £31,840 and £43,962.
The past 12 months benefited from the in-
creased accommodation and improved con-
ditions provided by the additions, completed
about June, last year. The comparisons
which follow show the;effects of;,recent hap-
penings on the balance-sheet figures :

Property and
equipment ~ 167,365 287,904 413,777 441,249.
A lot of new capital has been raised to aid
the expansion. In 1913, besides the £33,000
of 6 p.c.. prefs., there were ordinaries for
£75,000 ; by 1921 ordinary capital had in-
creased to £225,818, but £lOO,OOO of the
£150,818 increase came from reserves trans-
terred and the issue of scrip for goodwill in
the 1915 reconstruction. At the latest bal-
ance ordinary capital had moved to £253,733
wholly from cash subscriptions. But while
capital expanded only £27,915 in the past
two years, the book value of properties and
equipment advanced £153,345. While the
Hotel Macquarie people have been contem-
plating a rival enterprise financed by mort-
gages carrying 8 and 84 p.c. and *lO p.c.
prefs., the old-established Australia Co.
secured all the money it required at bank-
overdraft rates. In two years liabilities have
expanded from £36,782 to £139,841, and the
co. at June 30 showed £117,780 of liabilities
in excess of all liquid assets. That is a
heavy poultice of floating debt, but as there
is no other outside debt, and, on present
appearances, there are reasonably good pros-
pects of large surpluses over and above div.
requirements, the arrangement suits the co.
very well.

There is some doubt whether as much as
£4034 net was actually earned for the half
year. It depends on (1) whether sufficient
was allowed for depreciation for the period,
and (2) whether adequate provision was
made for taxes. One way and another, the
successful co. had a bad run: only on one
previous occasion were profits smaller. To
begin with, the prices of most of its raw
materials were higher, and wages were in-
creased by new awards, with a retrospective
sting in their tails. Compared with the pre-
vious six months, the gross profit on manu-
facturing and trading declined £2363, and
management and other overhead costs, main-
tenance, repairs, etc., were up £6298. Simul-
taneously, the co. was hit from another direc-
tion : land and income assessments for
£13,342 fell due, and £13,000 was withdrawn
from a reserve of £15,000 created for the
purpose, the odd hundreds having been made
a charge on current earnings. Why such a
large taxation call became due during the
period—it exceeded the average half-yearly
net profits for the previous three years—is
a matter the directors don’t explain. Only
£2OOO is now left in the reserve. The set-
back to the co. is probably only temporary:
it has always made a recovery from periods
of difficult trading, and when the books de-
finitely disclosed that the Profit and Loss
account was drifting to leeward, the man-
agement lifted its cafe charges. Meanwhile,
though not quite half-earned, the usual 10
p.c. div. was paid for the half-year.
The directors’ policy of vigorous extension
is being persisted in: several new tea-rooms
and restaurants have been opened and fac-
tory additions made. The whole of the sub
scribed capital of £175,000 was paid up at
June 30, £9753 having been got in during
the six months. But there was £3900 more
than paid capital in freeholds alone, and
also £15,800 in leaseholds and improvements,
and £97,000 more in machinery, plant amt
equipment. Stocks, book debts, cash and
other liquid assets totted up £46,829. To
carry all these belongings the co. was neces-
sarily leaning heavily on outsiders: £79,000
had been raised on mortgage, and £57,483
was owing to sundry creditors at June 30.
The effect of the wholesale purchase of pro-
perties and of the all-round rap’d expansion
of the business is shown in the following
comparisons:—

Fixed assets.. .. £128,415 £234,600 £291,700
Mortgages .. . . 13,250 50,000 79,000

During the past eight years fixed debt has
swollen £65.750 and current liabilities
£32,315. Shareholders have contributed
£38,572, and £43,314 of accumulated profit
has helped the expansion. Considering the diffi-
cult nature of the business —while Sargents
has prospered, others have gone to the wail
—the payment of 10 p.c. divs. every year
since the inception of the co. has been a
remarkable achievement. It should also be
noted that one-seventh of present paid capi-
tal was a bonus issue.

There have been no further visible develop-
ments in connection with the proposal that
the North Broken Hill Co. should purchase
the British,-Australasian, lock, stock and
barrel, by paying in cash and North shares
"the equivalent of about 235. 6d. per British
share.'’ Presumably details will not be forth-
coming until the annual meeting ot North
shareholders, usually held about the second
week in October. Until the principals in
the deal lay all their cards on the table
North shareholders will not be in a position
to decide one way or the other. Unless de-
tails are forthcoming prior to the North
meeting, those unable to attend personally
will need to be careful how they allot then-
proxies.
On the evidence available it _ looks as
though North shareholders ar.e being offered
a pup. Theirs is now the biggest mine on
the Hill: it has 20 years’ mill-feed in sight,
metal values are high and the mine can be
cheaply worked —and that means that the
North can operate profitably in low metal
markets. There are approximately four mil-
lion tons ore in sight, and excellent pros-
pects of huge additions lower down. Values
last year were 9.20 z. silver, 15.2 o.c. lead and
12.2 p.c. zinc. The British is rapidly quali-
fying for the list of has-beens; the prospects
of opening up further large bodies are not
bright. The grade of its ore is not so good
as the North average: latest published
figures showed almost 2oz. silver less per
ton and lead values at 13.5 p.c. and zinc 12.3
p.c. North ore is also much easier to treat.
A feature of the proposed purchase is that
North is asked to pay more for the British
than the present co. bought it for only re-
cently. Much, of course, depends on the
value placed on North shares for the pur-
pose of adjusting the 235. 6d. per British
share. But it is questionable whether it
is to North shareholders’ interest to expand
their share register and let others in merely
with the object of taking the British off the
hands of its present owners. As to _ the
motives prompting the deal, North direc-
tors should be called upon to disclose then-
hand. No doubt one objective is to secure
greater control of labor and metal markets.
But there’s more than that to it: to wrest
the British from the English co., and pre-
vent Woodhead and his crowd interfering
with the smooth working of the metal con-
tracts which Broken Hill and the Associated
Smelters are enjoying, the Zinc Corp. and
the North and South cos. were each landed
with 50,000 shares in the British-Austral-
asian float. Possibly some of the parties
interested in that arrangement desire to un-
load British scrip and get in on a sure
winner.

B. H. Central continues to pour water
into the fire area: about a million gallons
per day are being pumped in. Most of it is
coming from the Proprietary, Central and
South mines. Block 10 is closed down, water
being at the overflow-level from the Central
mine. The South has stopped all work on
the 1270 ft. level. Water lias been on the
plat several times, and pumps could not keep
it down. # #
B. H. Block 14 is to have another try,
and the Proprietary, which is nearing the
end of its big residue dumps, is to open up
again shortly and treat the ore from both
mines, which are end-on to one another.
“Sulphide”: The Bellbird colliery disaster,
with the death by suffocation of Aberdare
mine-manager Jack Brown while engaged in
heroic rescue work, emphasises the anti-
quated condition of the N. S. Wales mining-
laws. This prosperous coalfield could not in
emergency bring to light a single oxygen
breathing apparatus. Portable rescue sta-
tions on motor-trucks or railway-vans should
have been at hand immediately the alarm
was given. Legislation should insist on the
provision of oxygen breathing-jackets, and
also that no one should enter gassy portions
of mines after fires or explosions unless pro-
perly equipped. Several mine officials and
a Government inspector were gassed recently
while examining the B. H. Central mine.
They were highly-paid technical men, who
should have known better than to take un-
necessary risks. Oxygen-jackets are simple,
fool-proof affairs, comfortable to wear and
easy to operate. Hard work can be done in
them for at least one and a half hours.

The proposal to take over the Peak leases,
six miles from Cobar (N.S.W.), and work
them under one co., has reached _ the pros-
pectus stage. Peak Mines, N.L., in 500,000
2s. shares, is offering 300,000 contribs. and
giving leaseholders 150,000 fully-paids and
£3OOO cash for their mines, plant and equip-
ment. Substantial reserves of good-grade
ore are available for the co. to commence
with, but hopes for the future lie in the
vigorous development which W. S. Curteis
has planned.
Despite all the activity on and around the
old Lucknow field (N.S.W.) during the past
two years, there has been no recurrence of
the days when H. W. Newman used to place
a BOOOoz. cake of retorted gold on the local
pub-bar and offer it as a free gift to any-
body who could carry it away single-handed.
South Lucknow, Pups, Extended and
others operating to the south-east continue
prospecting, with tantalising indications to
occasionally revive enthusiasm, but decent-
sized bodies of crushing ore refuse to show
up. The South is pushing down its new
shaft, and is meanwhile doing a little pros-
pecting on the arsenical-pyrites shoots found
in drives from the old shaft. Pups, _ the
show nearest the old-time workings, has given
promising indications lately; development
appears to be proceeding on a true contact
position, but it is still purely a prospecting
go. Lucknow Mines, operating in the old
ground, has 26,000 forfeited shares on its
hands, and sd. per share for 13,000 of them
was the best offer at an auction last week.

Thompsons, of Castlemaine (Vic.), have
almost completed the suction-cutter dredging
plant for Tingha Tin (N.S.W.), and mana-
ger Grey Wilson hopes to commence metal-
winning with it early in December. To
pay instalments on the plant and provide
funds for transport and assembling the
directors have made a call of Is. (payable
this week) on the 60,000 shares. That will
leave a; balance of £2650 owing to Thomp-
sons, which is to come out of tin won. Re-
cent rains have filled the dam at Cope’s
Creek. Its capacity was doubled by rais-
ing the dam-wall s£ft. Consequently when
the plant is in trim, Tingha Tin is assured
of a long, continuous run.
Lempriere and Co. have evidently proved
the old slag-heaps at Tent Hill (N.S.W.)
worth treating. The material is being carted
to Deepwater railway station by horse-
teams. The heaps contain some thousands
of tons.
* * * w
During August the 10-liead battery at the
Lloyd George (W.A.) put through 1800 tons
ore for 4900 z. gold, and the cyanide plant
recovered 1360 z. from 1500 tons sands. The
mine was about 500 tons short of its quota
owing to a mill breakdown. Managing-
director Alf Forbes says that when pro-
perly opened up the L.G. will crush 3000
tons a month. This sounds big for 10 head,
but in Westralia they run 21 shifts a week
and drop their 10001 b. stamps 115 to the
minute. In this way the Edna May crushed
upwards of 3000 tons a month for over four
years with 10-head. In N. S. Wales the
average battery-manager reckons he is a
hustler if lie does 12 shifts a week and drops
8001 b. stamps more than 80 to the minute.
If spoken to about treating 1000 tons. a
month he talks volubly about the “necessity
of 40 head,” and speaks of his 10-head con-
traption as though it were a dolly-pot. It
reflects the wretched position into which
N. S. Wales gold-mining has drifted. Due
allowance must, of course, be made for the
free-milling nature of Westralian ores com-
pared with the complex stone in many N. S.
Wales reefs; but this factor should conduce
to greater hustling instead of the go-slow
which buries so much of the shareholder’s
hopes along with his cash.
Estimated ore reserves of Westralia’s four
largest gold-producers aggregate 1,522.396
tons. Ivanlioe heads the list with 602,014
tons, averaging 325. lid., Golden Horseshoe
is next with 533,742 tons worth 355., Gt.
Boulder 204,140 tons going 495. 6d., and
South Kalgurli 152,000 tons of 345. stone.
To make ends meet and occasionally show
a profit, Ivanhoe is obliged to treat or e valued
at lid. above its average grade, Golden
Horseshoe 3s. Bd., and South Kalgurli 4s.
The recovery value of ore treated by G.t.
Boulder, the only one of the four which is
not being worked above its capacity, is about
ss. below that of its average.
Last year Ernest Williams, a former man-
ager, was commissioned by the liquidator of
the old Boulder Perseverance Co. to report
on the condition of the mine, which had been
ransacked by tributors. He recommended
that the show be “resuscitated,” and that
the co. should again work it on its own
account. Williams was placed in charge,
and the other day he announced that the
new co., recently formed to take over the
show, would find his opinion of its value a
very conservative one.
Boulder No. 1 last year surrendered its
Ivalgoorlie lease, and was allowed to retain
four acres to a depth of 40ft. as a machinery
area. In the latest balance-sheet the value
of the co.’s leasehold belongings and plant
is shown at £232,760. But the ground re-
maining is worth next to nothing, and the
plant is so worn that it is probably worth
little more than old iron. The directors de-
clare that they are handicapped in their
endeavors to obtain a new property in West-
ralia owing to the high costs of mining. On
the other hand, prospectors and claim-hold-
ers allege that the co. shows no inclination
to pay a reasonable price for promising finds
offered it.
The old habit among Westralian promoters
of taking up defunct shows, changing then-
names, and then floating cos., has been re-
vived. The King of Creation, near Laverton,
is the latest to receive attention in this
way. # # * *
Freney Oil (W.A.) shareholders were un-
pleasantly surprised to hear at the annual
meeting that the bore which took 40 weeks
to drill 850 ft. had deflected 100 ft., and that
a fresh hole was being put down alongside
the old one. Chairman Nicholson admitted
that the bore had cost £5OOO, but he expected
the new percussion drill to get down to the
same depth in a couple of months for £BOO
to £lOOO.
Lander Oil will commence its drilling cam-
paign at Or alio, near Roma (Q-), with
finances in a very snug condition. Its brand-
new plant has been paid for, and £20,000
cash is in hand. The co. should give a good
account of itself when drilling commences :
the three Fife brothers, from California —
Roy, of the Associated (Mt. Gambier), has
joined his brothers at Orallo for a time —
have the very latest in rotary plants to
punch down the hole. Lander will be ex-
tremely lucky if it hits an oil-reservoir in its
first sink: the Californian experience is that
even on a proved field an average of only
one in seven or eight is productive. But
whatever happens the data will be of great
value in future operations. The co. appears
to be in one of the most likely oil-regions
in the Commonwealth, and American experts
are thoroughly satisfied, , from evidence
obtained from drilling at Roma, and from
the numerous geological specimens sub-
mitted, that prospecting bores are warranted.
A commendable feature of the Lander float
was the restriction on the transfer or sale
of shares until the first bore was completed,
so the scrip has not been made a gambling
counter.
The Russell and Johnstone rivers (Q.)
gold- and tin-dredging float is in full swing,
and the promoters are confident of making an
early start. Walter Colley has been in
Brisbane seeking suitable dredging plants.
1-Ie has been looking into the merits of an
improved drag-line excavator and a patent
concentrator invented by D’Arcy Hughes.
Government Geologist St.-Smitli elaborated
on the combination of the two machines in the
August Queensland Mining Journal. He
considers that there are good prospects of
the invention proving both efficient and eco-
nomical, but that it would be- “entirely pre-
mature to predict complete success.” An
area has been taken up at Calliope, near
Gladstone, on which the patents are to be
tested under working conditions. A com-
plete plant is expected to cost not more than
£5OOO.

There is keen speculation among colliery
experts as to how the Blair Athol,(Q.) venture
will turn out. The removal of 70ft. to 80ft. of
overburden, even to get at the world’s thick-
est seam of bituminous coal, is a tremendous
undertaking. At first it was bejieved that
the overburden was only about 50ft. thick.
Experienced colliery-managers doubt whether
the mine can carry the great initial expense
necessary to open-cut it, and, in addition,
pay the freight to Gladstone or Rockhamp-
ton, nearly 300 miles away. The railway
has been improved to permit extra-heavy
loading, but there is a strong opinion that
the field must have a direct line to the coast,
which should save 6s. or 7s. in freight.
Broadsound, about 125 miles distant, would
be the nearest port. That was J. F. Hall’s
idea when he planned to capture the export
trade with Eastern Asia. Rocky and Glad-
stone both put forward many reasons why
Broadsound should not be opened up, and
they persist that the present scheme should,
and will, pay. It’s rather late in the day,
of course, to propose a change, particularly
in view of the outlay on the present rail-
way system. Newcastle, Ltd., the rival co.
on the field, has not got an open-cut, and,
doubting the financial outcome of the scheme,
is reported to be searching for coal areas
nearer the coast.
If Beaudesert (Q.) has no oil, it certainly
has coal. The Beaudesert Goal Co. has been
prospecting just outside of the town, and is
reported to have struck a seam. The district
contains a good deal of volcanic rock, and the
likelihood of seismic action having affected
the coal-beds must be seriously reckoned with.
It is well known locally that a 20ft.-seam
is available near Mt. Lindsay, but it is of
no value at present owing to distance from
rail. Its chance may come if the Beau-
desert-Ivyogle connection is made via Rath-
downes or Richmond Gap.
Enthusiasm over the oil-hunt in the Cab-
bage Garden has evaporated, notwithstand-
ing that Torquay has just been told by one
Vaughan that it appears to be a likely
“dome.” Boola Boola and other Gippsland
ventures have gone cold. There isn’t even
a Stock Exchange gamble in one of the shows,
and things are pretty blue when that cannot
happen. Word has gone round Queen-street
that the Australian Oil Corporation is to be
put on the list of limited liability cos. to the
extent of 5s. a share. It tried Beaudesert
(Q.), and holds large areas in the Wyndbam
district (W.A.), and wants to take up a lot
of Northern Territory land.
The best Collins-street flutter since the
Waria River snuffed out has been the Thomo,
in which Palfreyman and the Teddy Miles
family figure. Thomo is held under option
from one Dr. Tilleke, of Siam, and is an area
of five sq. miles which the Chinese have been
working for years without hindrance. Water
and jungle are in plenty, and the area is
reached only by a forest track. Granite and
schists seem to be the country rocks, and
most of the reefs are small, though
rich as far as they have been tested.
E. Bonds, a Eondon mining-engineer, was the
sponsor for Thomo. He considers that the two
main quartz-lodes, from a foot to 5ft. wide,
run through most of the concession, and says
there are parallel narrow veins on which
John Chinaman is grubbing. On this re-
port the Palfreyman crowd sent J. R. Victor
to join E. L. Miles in running a rule over
the show. They report that the reefs show
good gold contents, though they are narrow
and irregular. They have picked on 600
acres of gold-dredging ground which they
think is the right stuff. No. 2 reef is to
have a decent test: the syndicate intends to
run in a drive 300ft. to see how it behaves.
There won’t be any trouble about getting the.
cash to equip if Palfreyman says the word.
Scrip soared from £7 to £40 on news that
the reef had sampled up to 8ioz., but the
market soon settled down into a saner frame
of mind.

“Too copious” is the phrase used to de-
scribe the water at the New Ristori deep-
lead show at Allendale, near the old Cres-
wick (Vic.) mines. So the tanks were
stopped, and a rush was made to the Mines
Department for a grant to allow a power
plant to be installed to drain the gutter.
Alec Peacock is too busy clinging to his port-
folio to respond, so the Ristori crowd will
have to find the cash themselves or let the
show slip.

"Sixenate”: It happened in Surry Hills
(Sydney), and it was the landlady who re-
ferred to the affray as “a lovers’ tiff.” The
first she knew of the matter was when Edwin
arrived at the establishment with two bottles
of beer in hand and indications of more under
liis waistcoat; Angelina signified her opinion
of his condition by a remark which reflected
upon his parents. Being a gentleman who
prized his family honor he “woodened her”
with one of the bottles, and shortly was
fiercely engaged with her brother and some
other lodgers. Ultimately he got “wood-
ened” himself, and he looked much the worst
of the party of hospital patients who told
widely-differing stories in court. It appeared
that there was some furniture as well as a few
windows broken, and the landlady thought

that these ought to be paid for, but if that
was done she was prepared to regard all
the other occurrences with the indulgence
that she always extended to young people on
the brink of matrimony. The magistrate
estimated the reparations lightly, assisted by
the landlady’s benevolent offer to regard
the breaking of a hallstand “as a sorter

“Harry J.”: Returning from London my
50s. tailor-made tunic was at once bespoken
by my mate Bluey, who was the next for
leave. Three days in the front line had to
intervene before he could get away, and his
instructions about the flash jacket were em-
phatic : “Don’t lie in the mud. Don’t spill
pork and beans down the front of it. And
don’t bump a shell and get it all mucked up
with blood.” “Take it now and be sure of
it,” I advised him. “No. I’m such a dirty
row,” he objected. “You wear it till we
come out.” Coming out Bluey stopped a
burst of machine-gun fire. But he had his
wish: we sent him off on his long furlough
near the ruined church in a tailor-made tunic,
brushed and cleaned and fit for a general on
a King’s Parade.

“Flicker”: Re “The Polycrates Case and
the A.J.C.” (B. 6/9/’23), A few years ago
an Adelaide racing man scratched the
favorite for a big race because he was
refused two-thirds of the sweep money. Still,
it is only fair to Adelaide to record that, it
has horse-owners who may rank along with
the three members of the Sydney Union Club
mentioned bv “D.” in the same issue. Squat-
ter Mortlock, of Martindale Hall, when
offered a bit extra if Yudnapenna should win
the Grand National, told the syndicate which
approached him that the animal was out to
win, and added that it had better put what
it had offered him on the horse. 5 udnapenna
duly romped home, and at least four workers
in S. Aus. have a good word to say for “the
flamin’ squatter.” +
“H. 0.8.”: My own experience of the
bayonet was that it was the deadliest weapon
of all, when it was used. That: is the
reason why it contributed so few casualtb s
to the dressing-stations and hospitals. At
Mouquet farm I saw, on one small patch ot
ground, 28 dead. Fifteen of them were
Australians, the rest Germans; every man,
examination showed, had succumbed to the
cold steel. It must have been an encounter
to the death, and there was nothing to indi-
cate what the odds were. But it impressed
on me that Fritz could do his bit with the
bayonet as well as our men. The wet
weather had turned the battlefield into a
sea of mud, and made rifles and machine-
guns alike practically useless. The bayonet
came into its own then.

“Kip” : At least one man solved the pro-
blem of how to live in comfort on a Pa cine
isle, and that was Wahlen. the llun who
built a “castle” on his copra plantation at
Maron, Hermit Island. The walls ov bis
former residence are thick enough to ensure
coolness; the house was placed where it gets
the benefit of every breeze that blows; it had
installed in it both electric light and ice-
making plants; it contained
many indoor comforts, and
was connected by telephone
with the office on the fore-
shore. But since the Expro-
priation Board took over the
place, things have under-
gone a change. When th->
few officials now living there
retire for the night they do
so with the aid of a kero-
sene lamp; beer off the ice
has become a dream of the
past; if they want to com-
municate with the office they
must despatch a houseboy,
for even the telephone ser-
vice has been dismantled.
It’s a good job the place
was so solidly built; other-
wise there might have been
an end to the only interest-
ing feature in this uninterest-
ing part of the Pacific.

“1465”: It doesn’t always
pay to go too far into de-

one of the cave-woman type,
who in this instance had
settled a street argument
by tapping the other lady
oil the head with a stick.
She was charged with
assault. On the day of the
hearing she did not appear,
and on her counsel entering
a plea of not guilty, the
Beak expressed a desire to
see the lady in person. The
invitation was instantly sent
forth, and the recipient as
promptly replied, regretting
her inability to oblige on the ground
that she had just had a hot bath. The heart-
less Beak puffed himself like a pigeon and
ordered a warrant to issue for her arrest.

“Lexite” : A recent Sydney divorce case, in
which a parson gave evidence that the hus-
band called to see him and they prayed to-
gether for fairer matrimonial weather, re-
calls an occasion upon which a Divorce Judge
decided that persistent prayers might con-
stitute cruelty. An elderly husband had
married a youngish woman, and soon
imagined cause to disapprove of her conduct.
He was not unkind in the ordinary sense;
but he continually invited the clergy and
others to come in and ask for guidance and
mercy for an erring sister. At last tue
avalanche drove the lady from home. A
solicitor advised that he could make out a
case of cruelty by showing damage to the
wife’s health, and the Court granted her a
separation. The respondent nearly got him-
self committed for contempt by briefly sup-
licating for the Judge when the decision was
pronounced.

"O. McKay M.” : On the very day of the
appearance of “Chancery Lane's” par. (B.
30/8/’23) ’about the method employed at
Castiemaine ( v ie.) to administer the oath to
a voiceless and deaf witness, a Hindoo plain-
tiff in Melbourne County Court provided
further problems for the judicial intellect.
Charn Singh couldn't bolna Angresi, as his
interpreter explained to the Court, and was
not, moreover, prepared to take his solemn
vow upon the Book usually employed. How-
ever, he proved amenable to reason. In con-
sideration of the obvious difficulties involved
in obtaining a pint of the sacred water of
the Ganges, Charn was finally induced to
allow a glass of Yan Yean to be substituted.
“D.F.”: Ireland has given Australia so
many pioneers, priests, policemen and poli-
ticians that I hate to disagree with “Yacko”
(B. 16/8/’23) when he describes James
Maria Matra, “the man who first suggested
the settlement of Australia to the British
Government,” as an Irish-
American. Matra was a .Corsi-
can. His claim to the distinc-
tion assigned him by “Yacko”
is, however, a rather feeble one.
It is true that he wrote to Lord
Sydney in 1783 suggesting that
loyalists from America should
be settled in Australia, but four
years earlier Banks, in giving-
evidence before a committee of
the House of Commons, had re-
commended the establishment of
a convict colony at Botany Bay.
Nothing worth while came of
Matra’s suggestion about the
American loyalists. As far as
I can learn only one of them
journeyed to N. S. Wales. Thar,
was James Reid, once a planter
in Virginia, who came this way
in 1791. Mere “schemes” for a
settlement in Australia go back
further than either Banks or
Matra. In 1719 one Captain
Welbe had a project for a colony
in “New Wales.” He seems to
have been a bit hazy about its
position, though, and he may
have been thinking of the Solo-
mons or New Hebrides rather
than Australia. A few years
later Jean Francois Puruy, a
Swiss, battled hard for a settle-
ment in Nuyts Land —some-
where along the Bight. His
main reason seems to have been
that he considered the latitude
just right for a colony. He
tried France, Holland and Eng-
land, but no one would listen
to him. Then he went to America and died.

“F. Clinton”: The people who sign the
visitors’ book at the cheap tourist resort
are conventional liars, as a rule; wherefore
life seemed a little brighter for a few minutes
when, after a distressing experience of the
establishment’s cooking, I read this recent
entry: “Home was never like this—thank
God'!”
“The Deacon”: Sunny Corner (N.S.W.),
where the sun seldom shines, has developed
a new type of “hatter.” His mode of life
suggests the primi-
tive caveman; he
lives in a hole in
the hillside, and
subsists on rabbits,
the bones of which
he piles up outside
his temporary
abode. Of late he
seems to have
abandoned shelter
of any kind, pro-
bably finding it too
comfortable for his
Spartan creed, and
just camps outside
his dug-out. Cor-
nerites are begin-
ning to take a per-
sonal pride in this
man of 40-odd who
can sit outside in a
snowstorm, crouch-
ed over a black-
fellow’s fire, and
come through smil-
ing when the same
storm has killed
most of the stock
in th e vicinity.
They p<>i n t out
their "hermit” to
visitors, and the
whole neighborhood
is vastly intrigued
as to his identity
and the wliaffor of
his strange exist-
ence. One theory
is that he is a Brit-
ish nobleman who
has abjured the
world ; others whis-
per darkly that he
is an ex-politiciar.
who has taken this way of revenging him-
self on ungrateful constituents. But the
subject of these speculations merely sik
tight—and traps rabbits.
“Ivirbo”: A sardonic humor on the part
of a husband was disclosed in a Maoriland
Divorce Court the other day during a suit
for a separation order. The petitioner was
a violinist; at least, she had a violin, which
hubby declared she scraped tunelessly, mono-
tonously and exasperatingly. Her attach-
ment to the instrument and the husband’s
dislike for it introduced such discord into the
home that the two had arrived at the stage
of occupying separate rooms. Then, one
evening, the man came home in the cheeriest
of moods. After dinner relations continued
unusually pleasant, and next morning it
seemed that the entente cordial e was firmly
• cemented when hubby tapped at his wife’s
bedroom door with an early cup of tea.
Gladdened and touched the woman rose to
DAISY BEING NO COOK.
THE BLONDE: “And why did they part?"
THE OTHER: “Well, you see, Daisy had an idea that to
attain marital happiness all she had to do was to
feed the brute —so you can bet he was soon fed up."
find the kitchen-range burning brightly.
Hubby’s mood continued, and the wife, after
tucking him into his coat and kissing him a
fond good-bye, ran to secure the fiddle and
pour out on its strings the thankfulness of
Her heart. But the thing had gone. The
cup of tea brought to the bedside had been
boiled with it!

[FUR THE BULLETIN.]
Summer and autumn dally with September ;
The cherry-trees still wear their raiment green:
The single roses linger to remember
The days of longer light when June was queen.
What are those flowers now dancing and now failing,
Great orange petals waving in the air?
The garden on a sudden lills with wailing ;
Under the arbors there is black despair.
The trampling fear, the bitter taste of burning,
The thirst, the terror in a thousand eyes!
Far back along the path of no returning
The snakes of fire are hissing at the skies!
Out to the open places! ?so delaying!
The sword of doom is poised and swift to slay. . . .
Ah, God! The bright-robed little ones were playing
By the dwarf maples only yesterday!

“Yerey Light”: “’E’s a ’ard doer,” said
Snowy apropos a badged worthy who had
given us a cheery ’Ow goes it?” from the
top of a bottle-o’s cart. “ Tin an’ me got a
Fritz up Houplines way one time. We
brought ’im inter our trench, an’ when we’d
souvenired ’im, Joe says, ‘Wot’ll we do with
’im?’ ‘Take ’im to th’ orficer, I s’pose,’
says I. ‘That’s no good,’ says Joe; ‘we’ll
give th’ pore blankard another charnst.
There’s ain’t enough Scran as it is.’ ’E
pushes th’ Fritzie up on th’ firestep an’
shoves ’is wrist-watch under ’is nose; then
’e points ter ‘one Second’ and then ter ‘3O
seconds’; then ’e points out over No Man’s
Land, an’ then ter ’is rifle. W’en ’e’s finished
the dumb crambo ’e gives Fritzie a shove on
to the parapet an’ yells ‘Orf!’ Jerry must
o’ compreed all right, becos ’e lit out for
’is own side. ’E’d ’a’ done it in th’ time,
too—’e covered th’ first 20 yards well under
evens—-only the Mills in ’is pocket bu’st. Joe
reckoned it wasn’t ’im that pulled th’ pin
out, but I see ’im with somethin’ dam’ like
a pin just after.”
WHAT’S IN A NAME.
“It took me ten years to learn that I couldn’t write
stories.”
“I suppose you gave it up then?”
“Oh, no. By that time I had a reputation, and didn’t
have to know how to.”
“Loco”: Twenty-five years ago X was a
railway fireman in Victoria. I can remem-
ber distinctly one place where, as the engine
topped a hill approaching a town four miles
on, we would catch the first glimpse of the
PA KNEW.
PA ( discussing engagement) : “An’ are you sure he loves you—that it isn’t your money
lie’s after?” „
SHE: “Oh, yes! He swore he worshipped me since the first time he saw me.
P A: “Where was that?”
SHE: “When we were surfing at Manly last summer.”
P A: “Then he is after your money.”
tower of a public building fairly between the
rails ahead of us. Recently, as an f engine-
driver, I was over the same line again. _ _Lne
tower is still visible as of old. But it is
just outside the left rail. It has not been
rebuilt. Neither has the line been shifted.
Can anyone account for the phenomenon? I
feel uncomfortable about it.
“W.H.R.H.” (Cape Town) :
The colored population of Cape
Towrn is increasing naturally
by a thousand per annum;
and added to this there has
been an influx of 4000 to
5000 natives within the last
two or three years. No
extra accommodation worth
taking into account has been
furnished, and the results
seem to us appalling. The
slum quarters of the town
have become filthy warrens,
where large • families occupy
each a room of a house; and
a case has recently come to
light where the landlord
rigged up a shelter consist-
ing of a few sheets of corru-
gated-iron against the out-
side walls of one of these
tenements and charged a
colored family fl a month
for the privilege of occupy-
ing it. They had not even
the whole place to them-
selves, for three natives also
lived there, separated from
the family by a strip of sack-
ing ! Is it any wonder there
is serious unrest among the
poorer classes? Fertile
ground . this for the Bol-
shevik agitator; and, while
there is, I think, no imme-
diate damger of sleepy Cape
Town witnessing scenes akin
to those which took place on
the Rand during the recent
rebellion, there is ground
for anxiety regarding the future.
* * * *
“Sturt”: S.A. Supreme Court has de-
cided that Judge Poole was right in direct-
ing a jury that their bigamy verdict of
“Guilty, but with no felonious intent,”
couldn’t stand. Yet, to. the lay mind, it
seems to express the position exactly, lne
bigamist’s original land in the eye of the
Law only) wife was his first cousin, lne
wedding was a war-time romance, and thej
never lived together. Both were R.C., and
when a priest told them such a marriage
was not allowed by their Church, they took
him to mean that it was of no legal effect
at all. The Court, however, insisted that
ignorance of the law does not excuse any-
body, and dwelt on the wrong done, however
unintentionally, to the second wife. Sen-
tence: Nominally six months, really about
four.
* * * . *
“Riverina”: Early in the summer of 1916
the heads in Egypt issued to us Tommy
tunics, shorts of yellow denim and dilapi-
dated cork helmets in place of our warm
ML. uniforms and felt hats. The try-on
was about the brightest episode in the whole
campaign. The largest pants were only
size 4, the display of bare leg suggested a
Highland regiment, and a complete under-
standing between the buttons and button-
holes was sadly lacking. When our tentful
paraded for Cairo leave Scotty McDonald,
a 16-stone warrior, was the star exhibit.
The limited waist of his shorts had been
reinforced with a liberal but wholly insuffi-
cient piece of dungaree at the back, and the
front had been criss-crossed with a bootlace
in a desperate attempt to conform with sar-
torial proprieties. But Scotty got. his leave
and gratified a long-cherished desire to see
the Sphinx. He often told us in reverent tones
of the deep impression it had made on him.
I often wondered what the Sphinx thought
of Scotty. #
“H K.” : Pictorial representations of Syd-
ney’s ’ earliest inhabitants almost invariably
depict them brandishing or carrying boom-
erangs But if reliance can be placed on
Ensign Barrallier, of the N.S.W. Corps,
who unsuccessfullv tried to cross the Blue
Mountains in 1802. this is all wrong. An
entry in his journal dated November 9, ot
that* year, reads: “The natives of this part
of the country [near what is now Picton]
make use of a weapon which is not employee!
by, and is even unknown to, the natives ot
Sydney. It is comprised of a piece of wood
in the form of a half-circle, which they make
as sharp as a sabre on both edges and
pointed at each end. They throw it on the
ground or in the air with such a velocity that
one cannot see it returning towards the
ground, only the whizzing of it being heard.
On the same day Barrallier narrates that
he heard the cry of “coo-ee * roI “
natives; this is the first recorded mentio
of the word by a white man.
* * * *
“Lex”: Half measures do not pay in the
business of crime: in fact, the law puts a
heavy premium on whole-hoggery. A recent
example was afforded by Alexander Cameron,
who at Ballarat, was convicted on lb counts
of forgery and uttering. He was sentenced
to nine months on each count, the sentences
to be concurrent in batches of eight, m
other words, Alexander will do 18 months for
two of his crimes and go scot free as regards
the 14 others. The Judge accused him ot
being “a man of. ability.” “Yes, said
Cameron (who, incidentally, has .lurid Vic-
torian and S. Aus. records), “Chief Justice
Stout said the same thing to me in Maon-
land ; he said he grieved to have to sentence
me.” So long as the law draws no distinc-
tion in its punishments between a criminal
who is guilty of a single offence and one
who faces the Court with a dozen or M
to his discredit, so long will shrewd cus-
tomers like Cameron make a welter or torg-
ing, or whatever their specialty may be, on
the principle that it is as well to be hung tor
a sheep as a lamb. # „
“F.A.” : While the Sydney City Council is
haggling over which side of Park-street it
will resume for the purpose of broadening
the thoroughfare, the ancient Barley Mow
is being transformed into a more preten-
titious pub. Sentiment has never appa-
rently prejudiced the Barley Mow s busi-
ness; possibly few of its pot-sinkers know
that it stands on the spot where many an
erring soul was freed from the clay at the
end of a rope a century ago. Anyhow, no
record exists of any reveller murmuring as
he blew the froth from off Ins pint:
I sometimes think that never tastes so good
The beer, from out the bottle or the wood,
Or soothes so gratefully a parching neck,
As on the site where once a gallows stood.
It was in 1804, shortly after Joseph Samuels
had been three times hanged and subse-
quently reprieved, that the suspensory was
removed from the corner of King and Eliza-
beth streets to the site on which the Barley
Mow now flourishes. #
“Percy Pawnticket”: Cynic Fate, which
is inclined to that sort of thing, played a
dirty trick on Wdliiam Rdwards, of Adelaide.
He had spent 05 years on the Register, and
for a long time had been a subscriber to
sweep lotteries. Then he won a prize ot,
roughly, £sooo—and a couple of weeks later
died suddenly, with the money, for which
he had hoped so long, practically untouched.
DISCRETION.
BERT: “It's pretty nippy, y’know! Don’t
you think you’d better have something
round you?”
G ER: “ Y-y-yes. Rut wuw-wait until we yet
a little fur-further into the bush.”
“Sturt”: The South Aus. Medical Board
has taken the step—which had no local prece-
dent—of getting an order from the Supreme
Court to remove a country doctor’s name
from the list of qualified practitioners, on
the ground of “infamous conduct.” He stood
his trial twice for assault on a girl in his
own surgery, and both times the jury dis-
agreed, on which further proceedings were
abandoned. The evidence was not published
—by strict order of the Court —but the de-
fence is understood to have been “consent”:
and from the point of view of professional
honor that doesn’t make much difference. At
any rate the application for the removal of
the name was not opposed.
SEPTEMBER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When grey Winter sullies
No longer the gullies,
Nor sweeps the bush bare
Of tassel and jewel,
But, craven and cruel,
Creeps back to his lair,
Ah! the blue of the heavens,
As mantled Spring leavens
The hills everywhere
With his wonderful dower
Of fern-frond and flower,
A rose in his hair,
And waves a “Hail fellow,
Well met!” to each yellow
Bent wattle-bough there !
Oh, the gladness and glowing,
The seeds and the sowing,
The rhapsodies rare,
When Love is beginning
To set young hearts singing,
And Life, with the ringing
Of Laughter, is fair!
When Mem’ry discloses
The poor, faded roses
Of Springs that are gone;
Of Springs when our laughter
Rang, too, to each rafter
That Heaven leans on ;
Of Springs when no shadows
Swept over our meadows
And brighter suns shone
Than that which is sinking
To sleep now, .and linking
The doing and done.
Ah, we who remember
Our own dear September,
And that which it won,
Still thrill as its aiding
Makes lighter Life’s lading,
Still feel through our fading
The warmth of its sun!

Dr. Stanley Argyle, who has been included
in the Vic. Composite Cabinet, has not been
three years in Parliament. He was born at
Kyneton, and is among the medical front-
rankers. Argyle was something more than
an interested spectator when the revolt of
students occurred in Trinity College at the
’ Varsity in 1890. Nearly every student who,
like him. showed spirit then has done well
since. When the doc.’s brother Reggie was
member for Dalhousie he let an Hon. Minis-
tership slip through his fingers in 1915. Per-
haps he has warned Stanley not to be too
fastidious and altruistic. Anyhow, it will
be interesting to see how Argyle and Allan
will compromise on redistribution of seats.
R. 11. McLeod, who has been declared win-
ner of the Daylesford (Vic.) Assembly seat
on a foul, has spent most of his life either
schoolmastering or in journalism. In the latter
craft his specialties have been racing and
football, but he has had some experience of
Parliamentary galleries, too. In Westralia,
10 or 12 years ago, some of the younger and
more ambitious Labor members got the idea
that a closer acquaintance with what in Eng-
land are called “the humanities” would be
a tower of strength to them in debate, and
McLeod, who was known to have some smat-
tering of the classics, was selected as a
suitable mentor to introduce them to some
of the illustrious orators of other days. But
after two or three helpings of Cicero the
class fell to pieces. It couldn't find any
kick in Cicero.
When Oman was leaving office in Vic.
last w T eek he had the grace to say. that he
had had a good innings, having liad 2108
days under Bowser and Lawson without a
break. Barnes, whose record was 1996
days, was equally philosophical. Other
Ministers had not had such a long innings;
still, they tried to look as if they were not
sorry for themselves.
“Lignum” : Even in the old days they had
some ideas in advertising. Before the city
of Goulburn (N.S.W.) had left the small-
town stage, Charles
Rogers opened his
store-keeping busi-
ness there with a
cheerful advt. A
window was dressed
to represent a
cemetery, with
graves and tomb-
stones all complete,
and each headstone
announced in th°
usual formal
phraseology the de-
mise of the busi-
ness of one of his
rivals. Two of
Rogers’s sons still
“carry on” a little
further up the
street.
HARRY LEON
WILSON, the
American novelist,
at present discover-
ing “that most
interesting problem
-Australia .”
“0.P.11.” : George Prendergast, Vic. Labor
Opposition leader, who is now approaching 70,
is at long last showing signs of age. If he
wants to lengthen his days in the House he
will need to slacken off and allocate the
Opposition work to colleagues only too eager
to get a show as lieutenants or corporals of
the party. Prendergast didn’t get excited
when Irvine sent for him the other day after
Lawson had technically resigned. Pie said
frankly that he couldn’t command a
majority in the House. The Lieut.-Gov.’s
deputy had a job to find the Labor leader,
and finally ran him down at a picture-show
which was giving a free display for poli-
ticians.
“Gillo”: Harry Coyne, elevated to the
Land Court Bench of Queensland, is a Vic.
native, 59 years of age. During the big
Brisbane tramway strike of 1912 Coyne was
chairman of the committee which issued
coupons, in return for which various but-
chers, bakers and grocers undertook to supply
goods to those presenting them. These
vouchers, with the credit of the Trades Hall
behind them, were freely taken. Bpt sud-
denly the currency was found to be slump-
ing. Five-shilling coupons were changing
hands for half-a-crown, and even for a shil-
ling. Some enterprising printer had loosed
a few thousand pounds’ worth of counterfeit
coupons on the market, and the imitations
were so good that Coyne himself couldn’t
tell them from the originals. The end of
it was that the committee, being quite un-
able to differentiate, had to assume liability
for the lot. This has always been accepted
as the reason why no balance-sheet was ever
published.
Joseph Husband, 1.5.0., who went out the
other dnv, had 42 years in the N.S.W. ser-
vice. He was a Yorkshireman, and after
serving his time in various engineering
works, joined the Mulvanneys when they
opened their mines in the Ruhr, and stayed
there nine years, including the period of the
Franco-Prussian War. Coming to N.S.W.
in 1879, he joined the Public Works Depart-
ment, and climbed
to the rank of in-
spector, with a for-
midable reputation
as a constructional
expert. While en-
gaged on the big
Bondi sewer Hus-
band designed and
patented a sand
shield which
brought a congratu-
latory avalanche
upon his head. He
was retired by the
Water Board at 84
with the proviso
that he could be
called on if wanted
—and 12 • months
later they had to
send for him to see
them through a
heavy repair job in
deep sand, which
called for the vet-
eran’s special
knowledge.
City Councillor
S. R. WHIT-
FORD, Labor
M.L.A. for North
Adelaide.
“Topee” : For two years at Kokopo I was
the next-door neighbor of Dr. Couppee, who
is now retiring from the R.C. bishopric of
Rabaul. He always recalled Jean Valjean’s
bishop. He was passionately fond of child-
ren, and whenever his funny little De Dion
tricar arrived at Chinatown from Vunapope
(25m.) it and its occupant were soon
smothered with kiddies of various tints.
Under German law all missionary societies
had to be registered as limited liability cos.;
hence the peculiar description of the prelate
and his mission in official documents (I
quote from a Government Gazette) : “The
Mission of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus
Christ Limited at Vunapope. F. Couppe6,
Bishop, Managing Director.”
Adelaide lost one of its best-known un-
official citizens when the ex-newspaper-seller
Sammy Lunn died suddenly the other day.
He talked himself into popularity during the
war, had an endless flow of rhyming jingle
and an irresistible collecting-box. Presently
every patriotic body was glad to enlist him,
for, unlike so many of that time, he was a
doer as well as a talker, and he ended as
0.8. E.
Bede Carroll, a genial character with a
ruddy face which wore a laugh as a habit,
has written his last par. For many years
on the Sydney Telegraph, and then on the
Sunday Times and Referee, he dealt with
motoring and cycling, and, incidentally, was
handicapper for the N.S.W. League of Wheel-
men. Death, unwilling to give a good fellow
suffering, beckoned him while he was talking
cheerily to a friend in a tram, and the end
had come before the ambulance got him to
Sydney Hospital.
“Intombi”: A remarkable nonagenarian (if
only half of what was told of him is true)
passed out last month at the Thursday
Island hospital, of which he had been an
inmate for some years. Joseph Austen,
familiarly known as “French Joe,” was a
native of Corsica, and fought with the
French in the Crimea. Wounded and
left for dead, he was picked up by
British troops, and at the close of the
war reached England, where he is said to
have been decorated by Queen Victoria per-
sonally for information supplied to the British
command. How he arrived in Australia is
something of a mystery, but it is supposed
■ he deserted with others from a French
warship, and, making inland, drifted
amongst the aboriginals, living with them
for many years. Years later Governor
Macgregor found him in New Guinea living
amongst the natives. His closing years were
spent on Thursday Island, where he became
a well-known identity. The late Lord Kit-
chener, on the occasion of his visit here,
noticed Joe’s decorations, and immediately
entered into conversation with the Crimean
veteran. Also, on leaving, he shook hands
with him, which was as good for Joe as
another decoration.
“Tne Wanderer” : Dr. Stopford said in the
Assembly the other night that he would write
the following epitaph over Greg. McGirr,
M.L.A.:—
Here lie the bones of Greg. McGirr,
Where he's gone I do not care;
If to the realms of peace and love,
Farewell to happiness above;
If haply to a lower level,
I can’t congratulate the Devil.
Unashamed plagiarism, of course; the dog-
gerel was written about a sometime Sydney
politician who subsequently became Lord
Sherbrooke and Gladstone’s Chancellor of the
Exchequer. Substitute “Robert Lowe” for
“Greg. McGirr” and “know” for “care” and
you have the original. If McGirr feels at
all downhearted he should get a copy of C.
Fetherstonhaugh’s book, “After Many
Days,” and he will find a couple of epitaphs
that with a little twisting will do for Dr.
Stopford.
S. Aus. keeps a flavor of the Church even
in its courts. Of the four present Supreme
Court Judges, three—Gordon, Poole and
Parsons —are sons of the manse. The late
Chief also had a parsonieal dad. The pre-
sent Chief, though his 72 inches are topped by
wintering hair, carries himself with more
physical spring than any of his colleagues,
and has a pastoral ancestry too; but their
flocks were the famous Murray stud merinos.
William Pope, the Adelaide lawyer, left
£160,000, which is a large fortune for S.
Aus. Though twice married, he was childless.
Since he retired from politics in Banana-
land, Peter Airey, ex-Treasurer and ex-Home
Secretary, has been farming on the line run-
ning south from Brisbane; but he still turns
out a good deal of copy, political and other-
wise, for the press.
The funds of the Vic. Nationalist Federation
must be falling as low as rumor suggested.
Archie Whyte, the sec. and chief of staff,
whose last effort was the winning of the
Daylesford seat, has thrown up his job and
gone into “commercial pursuits,” so it is
explained. Proceedings will be much more
solemn without the breezy Whyte, who for-
merly bounced around for the S/M. Hekald
in Sydney and Melbourne.
“H.W.L.” : Several pars, lately have men-
tioned Sir Joseph Banks as the father of
Australia. The Campbell Town (Tas.)
Library has received a photograph of Adam
Jackson, the first Warden of Ross. He
married a niece of the great Sir Joseph,
Julianna Banks, at St. John’s Church, Laun-
ceston, in 1836, about 10 years after his arri-
val in the Speck. For a while he lived at
George Town, but settled down at Ross, on
the Williamswood estate. He died in 1877,
and although there were 11 children all his
male descendants have died out.
“Yankee Doodle”: “The Deacon” writes
(B. 26/7/’23) of “the late” Donald Mclvil-
lop, brother to Mother Mary of the Cross.
The Rev. Donald, S.J., is still alive. He
had a golden jubilee at Norwood (S.A.) last
year—of his ordination, I presume.
The death of Mrs. George Bennett at
Camberwell (Vic.) has revived memories of
her husband, who was for 16 years one of
the personal favorites of the Cabbage Gar-
den’s Leg. Assembly, in which he sat most
of the time as Trenwith’s colleague for the
then double-seated Richmond constituency.
He was a bold Minister who refused Bennett
anything reasonable, as an appeal to the
House would always end in George’s favor.
Old politicians still chuckle as they recall the
confidence motion—French fashion—which
Bennett brought on during the first Turner
regime when office-intriguing was rife.
Fred Gray seconded the motion ; but because
Bennett didn’t like that lanky, be-whiskered
man from P’ran, he promptly withdrew it.
“Woolbale Mick”: Tell “Pat Bushie” (B.
23/8/’23) that his nomination for the Juvenile
Heavyweight Stakes will need to fill out a
bit to beat one in this district (Muttaburra,
C.Q.). She is the 13-year-old daughter of
a station-hand, and turns the scales at 19st.
131 b.
“T.P.”: Artist Hilda Rix-Nicholas is the
only surviving daughter of the late Henry F.
Rix, 8.A., inspector of schools in Vic.- —-a
big man, mentally and physically, an old-
time crack footballer and a noted education-
ist. The pair were chums, and frequently
drove together from school to school in N.-E.
Vic., where Hilda painted outside while dad
earned his crust within. Rix carried seeds
and plants with him on his rounds, and
jumped from his trap here and there by
stream or swamp to pop a young tree in a
congenial spot, giving a friendly hint to
schoolchild or farmer to look after it.
‘‘Rix’s trees” flourish, and are cherished to-
day throughout his old district. Just as he
was preparing, on retirement, for a trip to
the Cold Land, the Reaper called.
Every Saturday night for many years at
Croydon, a town nestling under Mount Dan-
denong (Vic.), a loud report has caused resi-
dents of the district to turn towards “Look-
aboot-ye,” an ap-
propriately - named
cottage with a
tower; and just
two minutes later
a rocket has in-
variably shot sky-
ward. That meant
the exact time was
8 o’clock, ana
watches were set
accordingly. Some
weeks ago these
familiar signals
ceased, and a little
later the one re-
sponsible for them,
parson Challis, who
for long had been
an invalid, had a
mound heaped over
him in the C.E.
portion of the Box
Hill Cemetery.

“T. 0.1.”: William John Turner Clarke
was the founder of the family which pro-
vided Australia with its first baronet, and
Vic. with its latest President of the Council.
“Big” Clarke, as he was called in his later
days, landed in Van Diemen's Land from
Somerset in 1830, and crossed to Melbourne
10 years later. He acquired vast areas of
land in all the colonies, and succeeded John
O’Shanassy as Governor of the Colonial
Bank. His will was proved in Victoria at
a million and a half. The Vic. property
went to W.J. (the first baronet) ; the S
Aus. and M.L. estate to Joe, and the Tas.
lot to Thomas.
“T.R.H.” : Lork Birkenhead was only 51
last month, and a letter from the Cold Coun-
try tells me that his future is causing much
speculation. Ex-“ Galloper Smith” was at
one time Carson’s second in his Irish duel,
but he joined forces with Lloyd George in
the Coalition Government—the grave of more
than one lawyer ambitious to be considered
“honest.” He accepted the Lord Chancellor-
ship, thinking either that when the Tories
came back he would still be in the job or
that the Lords would be so reformed that he
would continue to be a power in the land.
But Bonar Law and his Conservatives had
such a thumping majority as to be indepen-
dent of any broken reeds, and the House of
Lords—-in which the two prevalent odors
nowadays are beer and soap—will not re-
form itself, and the Tory Government won’t
attempt it. So what is to become of Freddy
Smith, the Earl of Birkenhead? His latest
threat is to go back to practise at the Bar!
It would be absolutely without precedent for
an ex-Lord Chancellor to return to the liar,
but Freddy is a law unto himself, and with
his expensive tastes he cannot possibly pay
20 skillings in the pound out of the “paltry
pension” he gets as ex-Lord Chancellor.
Mildura (Vic.) Shire has one Federal and
two State reps., and all three are now
Cabinet Ministers. Its greatest champion
is P. G. Stewart, the beetle-browed farmer
from Carwarp, who is Federal Minister for
Works and Railways. Now 57-year-old
George Louis Goudie, one of the district’s
reps, in the Vic. Uppah Chambah, and a
sheep-farmer of some circumstance, has been
given Mines and Works in the half-and-half
Lawson Cabinet. And Francis Edward Old,
who dropoed into the vacancy created by
Stewart when he departed for a higher
sphere, is given Agriculture and Railways.
He is a native of Dingee, near Bendigo, and
has been trudging in the -wake of a plough
for 80 years.
“T. 0.1.” : The death of John Proctor Lister
at 78 sends one’s memory back a half-century
to a little auction-room in Pitt-street, Syd-
ney—in one of the houses owned by Reuben
Uther, and situated near what is now the
Hotel Arcadia. Lister and Grisdale car-
ried on a sales-room there, and here
it was in 1872 that detective Elliott
arrested one of the Parramatta River
murderers, George Robert Nicholls, who had
left for sale the belongings of the two men,
Walker and Bridges, whom he and his con-
federate, Alfred Lester, had done away with.
I -was present when Nicholls was appre-
hended, and later saw him and his fellow-
ghoul hanged.

I am alone; and yet, behold,
Close to my hand, a silent one,
Who breathes with me, and doth enfold

“Valamae” : Recently I came across what
was to me a new method of shooting plain-turkeys.
A mob of a couple of dozen had been frequenting our
parts, and we had never been able to get, within gun-
shot of them, so when we noticed our neighbor going
out after them the other day our money was on the
turkeys. He had ridden to within 150yds. of the
birds, when they got the wind up and decided to
move. Immediately he jabbed the spurs into his
neddy, and started off in pursuit. They hadn’t flown
100yds. and were just getting up pace by the time
ho was under them. Dropping the reins on his
horse’s neck he stood up in the stirrups and ga • e
the lowest, turkey both barrels. The second did toe
trick, and the bird hit the ground right in front of
the horse. The chap who did it reckons it’s dead
easy; still, I wouldn’t advise anyone without a
sure-footed horse to try it.
* * * *
“Quandong”: Here’s my little Queer Acci-
dent that’s just happened. I was driving a mixed
mob of jumbucks, when two Williams started to
make love to the same lady and decided on a duel.
They moved to the rear of the mob for the stousb,
then solemnly backed away preparatory to charging
each other. Just as they went at it, a poddy lamb
that Was following the mob walked in between
the two heroes —and got the full force of both
rams’ heads amidships. Poor Poddy is now some
little angel Mary’s lamb up Above.
* * * *
“Skyrider”: “Human” (B. 9/S/’23) is
welcome to his little joke about the speed of the
black mamba, but the Adelaide Mail was not such
a long way out when it said that reptile would
keep pace with a galloping horse. Natives in the
Upper Uinkomaas Valley (Natal) could tell “Hainan”
some truthful stories about the mamba which
would surprise him. If attacked, the reptile must
be killed at once, or the would-be slayer must
trust to his horse, and ride like blazes at that.
Archie Cockburn, of Richmond, Natal, whose name
will be known to many of the Bulletin’s S’African
readers, used to tell of a two-mile gallop he had
in front of a mamba which he had disturbed, and
he had to outdistance the black terror by riding
his horse, a fine animal, all out. Then he dis-
mounted and loaded his gun, which he had not had
a chance to get at before, and shot the thing as it
came along the track. The fiends run to 20ft. in
length and their bite is deadly. The green mamba
is almost as swift as its black brother, but is
not as feared. During a residence of some years in
Natal I never heard the black mamba spoken of
except with horror.
* * * *
“Ned Kelly”: What is the biggest Binghi
on record? In Queensland in 1906 I met an out-
size on the Mitchell River. For a plug of tobacco
he allowed us to measure him: he taped 6ft. 9in.,
and was built in proportion. I estimated his weight
at about 18 stone.
* * * *
“A.L.E.”: A while back someone wanted
to know if he was the only person who had seen a
kookaburra at sea. At 5 o’clock one November
morning in 1919 I was snapper-fishing off Rickett’s
Point, Beaumaris (Vic.), when I caught sight of a fairly
large bird in the water making towards my boat. Pre-
sently I identified him as a laughing jackass. He
had apparently come from the western shore of
Port Phillip, and before he could reach Beaumaris
had fallen into the sea, exhausted. He struggled
gamely and tried to rise, but to no purpose—he was
too far gone. Then his head fell to one side, and
this was too much for me; I pulled up the anchor
and went to the rescue. Johnny was “all out,” so
I wrapped him in my coat and took him home, and
gave him food and water. He soon became himself
again, and for days stayed about the house, but
eventually vamoosed without bidding me good-day.
Personally, I’d never seen a kookaburra over the
sea before—let alone in it.
* * * *
“W.A.D.”: “Picko” (B. 9/8/’23) has evi-
dently heard of my cattle-dog, Mick, trained by
Alec Thompson, abo. tracker employed by the police
to track the black Dora Dora murderers about 12
years ago. Michael was always ready to drive the
schools of mullet into the mesh net as soon as it
was put down in the Upper Macleay (N.S.W.).
“Picko” mentions the fisherman in his story as
looking for trout; but trout don’t swim in shoals,
being very much like the Australian bass or perch
in their habits and methods of feeding.
“Jimmy Possum”: I never heard of any-
one trying to stand on his head in a hollow tree
(B. 2/8/’23), but I know a case in which a cockie
upended himself in a sft. post-hole one day, and
would have died there if his old woman and kiddies
hadn’t fished him out. He had tried to economise
in labor, with the result that the excavation became
so narrow at the bottom that he couldn’t work a
shovel, and when he tried to scoop out the loose dirt
with a billy he slipped and got jambed in the hole,
head down. He had had quite enough of it when
hauled out an hour or so afterwards.
“Tarago”: I’ve never seen a dingo quite
so bold as “Pat Bushie’s” (B. 16/7/’23), but in
chasing one he has turned on his tracks and come
a L me - t As a nipper 1 have had them “ rin s” me
(their favorite method of attack) till I backed up
against a tree. Old bushmen hold the pure-bred
dingo in contempt, but with the half-breeds they’d
take no chances. Incidentally, the same authorities
maintain that it is impossible to tame, much Jess
train, the pure-bred. I owned a half- or quarter-
breed myself, but she was absolutely unreliable and
useless except at killing snakes—and, by the same
token, she’d kill most things that would die with
the snap of her jaws.
HE'D PUT IT TO THE TEST.
FATHER: “What in the world arc you doing with your rabbit, Billie?”
BILL: “Teacher told us that rabbits were the greatest multipliers in the world, and this
dummy can't even do addition.”
“Ento” : I have long cursed the continued
misuse of the name “locust” for the shriller of the
tree-tops. Again I was completely “had,” for pot till
reaching the end of his par. did I realise that
“Pick” (B. 16/8/723) was referring to the cicada.
To have found the pupa of a locust, either a tree-
inhabiting variety or a ground-living form, em-
bedded in a bit of timber that had been taken down
a mine 60 years before would be truly marvellous,
but in the case of the cicada, which spends all but
a brief span of its life underground, the marvel
diminishes. In America there is a notorious case of
a cicada living 17 years before reaching the adult
stage, and another reputed case of 25 years. The
duration of any Australian cicada is unknown, but
three-score years is certainly too long a stretch even
in this land of wonders. “Pick” had better ascer-
tain some means whereby the cicada could have
reached the abandoned mine other than by the
hand of man.
* » * *
“FY7” : What breed of Binghi did “Orion'*
(B. 2/8/’23) see using the contraption of weights at
each end of a thong for slaying emus? The South
American weapon is supposed to have been used
originally by the Libyan ostrich-hunters, and was
introduced by the Moors to Spain. Thence the bolas
we.it to South America with the conquistadores. In
a fairly long and close acquaintance with the Aus-
tralian abo. and the literature dealing with his
methods and manners, I have missed any reference
to such a thing being used by him, and I’m particu-
larly hungry for more details.
TO ORDER.
JILL: “I wish the Lord had made me a man”
JACK: “He did. I'm it.”
“Veronal”: Seasons of severe drought tell
le
severely not only u P on horses > cattle and sheep, but
ako upon tile wild things. This year, one of long-
continued drought on the far South Coast of N.S.W.,
bell-magpies, or hill crow-shrikes, have appeared in
gardens, orchards, etc., in and about the towns,
their natural food supply—native fruits and berries
chiefly—having run short. Drought affects the
wild figs and other native fruit and
trees and shrubs just as it does those which are
cultivated, and their yield is consequently small.
I rejoice in an orange-tree covered this season with
tough, juiceless, ripe fruit about the size of large
marbles and as satisfying and valuable as Dead Sea
apples. Satin-birds also left their native scrubs
and jungles this season to feed on black privet and
dull scarlet hawthorn berries in the gardens. By
the way, I recently discovered a fine hawthorn tree
at the foot of a mountain range —the progeny, no
doubt, of a seed carried from afar by a bird.
* * * *
“Lindesay”: I knew a boss-manager out
in the far west of N.S.W. whose hobby was shoot-
ing match-boxes off the abos.’ heads. He would
stand 20 paces away, and the bullet would ring the
bell every time. I never knew him to miss. An-
other favorite stunt was ho make two gins stand
face-to-face with a matchbox held between their
noses. No deaths occurred on the run in my time,
and the abos. seemed immune to funk —they knew
each little Billy Tell act meant more tobacco for
them.
Dear Bully, —Dad and mum have told me
to ask you not to print any more pars, about men
chopping their own heads, or cutting the back of
their skulls by swinging the axe too high between
their legs. You see Bob believes the first yarn and
Jack believes the second, and they’ve both been
demonstrating. But Bob got too close to the wind-
mill and uad’s best axe is not much good now; ana
Jack —well, mum’s the one who has to patch his
pants.—Yours, Spadger.
* *■ * #
“Zanthus”: It is easy to settle the con-
troversy whether Cook or Dampier was the first white
man to see the kangaroo. Neither of them was.
Either a kangaroo or a wallaby was seen by a white
man long before either of them was born. In an
ancient work on natural history, published about
1580, there is a woodcut of a marsupial with a young
one in its pouch. The drawing is not very good, and
the front legs are too big, but the illustration, such
as it is, may be accepted as evidence that someone
had seen a marsupial in a period as remote as Queen
Elizabeth’s spacious times. Not even the Cubists of
that day would have invented such a freak. It does
not prove, of course, anything as to the discovery of
Australia. There are wallabies in New Guinea, aiso
in the Arus and other neighboring islands. Tbi
Portuguese reached New Guinea in 1511, and Lie
Spaniards a little later.
* *
“Condamine”: I got this letter from a
brother in the baekbloeks of Bananaland the other
day: “I saw your par. in the Bully about the
time we rushed Blucher across the flooded Moonie;
but you’d have to make it a concession bet if you
backed that against another incident I was mixed
up in. I was taking a mule transport over the
Jordan, and the beggars didn’t like the swing of
the pontoon bridge, so they took to the water and
crawled over on the bottom. They were out of
sight for yards, but got across. Then the silly
brutes got stuck in the mud on the edge. One
drowned, and we had to strip off and wade in up
to our waists in mud to hook on and pull them
out. Still, as it was about 127 degrees in the
water, we didn’t mind that.”

ON THE TRACK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I have lived two days on a pint of flour,
And I’ve buckled my belt up tight;
I’ve a blucher-boot on my left-side foot,
And a button-up boot on my right.
It is fifteen weeks since I lost my job,
And a month till the first sheds start;
The days are hot and the stages long,
And the tucker would break your heart.
It is fifteen weeks since I earned a pound,
And it’s twelve since the last was spent
On a bit of a spree at a township pub
(With a quid or two that I lent) ;
A hot wind blows from the dry north-west,
There’s a rim of gum on my lips;
And my shoulders ache where the swag-straps drag,
And my trousers sag on my hips.
There are times when I feel that I’m scarce a man,
As I cringe to a Chinese cook
For a crust of bread or a. scrap of meat
That has hung for a week on a hook ;
Then I slink like a man that has broken gaol—
Sneak off by the nearest cut—
With my back to the door of the boss’s house
And my eye on the swagman’s hut.
The coach-road runs in a dull red line,
But it’s long since the coach passed by;
And I follow a drain for a mile or so
Till I come to a tank that’s dry.
I have cleaned my pockets and smoked the dust
And I’ve smoked the last of the tea ;
And little I’d care if it were to-day
The end of the road for me.
I drop my swag in a beefwood shade—
I have plenty of time to rest—
Till the birds wing off to the nearest pool,
When I’ll follow their thirsty quest;
Mirages mock as I sit and brood,
Or I battle it out with fate —
Yes, I talk to myself at a time like this
For the want of a better mate. ’
BUSH HOSPITALITY.
“Hey! Care for a drink er tea?”
I called at a place where I once had worked
(But the bank was running it then
From a map spread out on their city desk) ;
I had heard that they wanted men.
They gave me an axe when I asked for food,
And I swung it well for an hour;
But the only bite that I got that night
Was a pint of weevily flour.
Then I saw the glare of a drover’s fire,
And I felt that my luck was right;
There’s always a meal in a drover’s camp
With a doss by the fire at night.
Though gruff were the words that the drover spoke,
He’d the heart of a Christian man;
I followed the sheep for a day or two,
With my swag in the drover’s van.
I think awhile of those city men
Who reckon they’re on the land,
As they preen themselves in a week-end camp
Or sport on the ocean sand.
They write the stuff that I read to-day,
And they boast of the race and flag ;
But they’d change their tune if they changed their lot
With a man that carries the swag !

“Geo. Rich”: “Mag’s” version of the old.
subject of the birth of the ’roo (B. 21/6/’23)
agrees with the account given by an ancient native
in South Groperland. According to this binghi
the young ’roo is born in the natural way and
SUCH A THING AS DOING A JOB TOO WELL. e
“What's he kickin' the dawg fe r ?"
“It bit his mother-in-law when she teas visitin' Ms place."

falls on to the furless part of Ma’s tail. Mum
then picks up the mir.jiature, hairless infant with
her mouth, and places it on the teat. The old abo.
spoke of it as a flatter of course, after having
witnessed a confinement.
“Quandong” ; j have a precocious cowlet
that can beat “Vnot’s” record (B. 5/7/’23). She
won William’s affection in October last year, just
before he was bundled off to Homebushi to have
tin put round him. The heifer was then a little
over four months old, and still dependent on the
old lady for rations, as the season was bad. I
stumbled on her the other day with an unusually
large heifer calf. Both are doing well, thank you,
and can be seen in the cowyard every morning after
Ma has proudly handed me her gallon of juice.
IX ORDER OF PRECEDENCE.
“Wof's wrong, Bill?"
“ Wife's down with the 'flu, and me best con's (lead crook."
"Off fer the doctor?"
“No, vet!"
“Bill R.” : Kempe’s “Engineer’s Year
Book,” mentioned by “Jack Horner” (B. 9/8/’23),
is utterly wrong in ascribing a want of durability to
red-gum used underground. At Young’s Swamp
(South Coast, N.S.W.) I once assisted in removing
a mile line of red-gum posts that had stood there
over 30 years. Above ground they were shrunken
and weathered, but below they had" the Appearance
of having oeen newly split. In every district wherein
the red-gum grows it is always the-specified timber
for under-house blocks, fencing-posts and culvert
.deck-heads, and after nearly a half-century of yakker
.■amongst all kinds of timber I know of only one sort
that equals it for keeping sound in the soil. That
:is the vellow-box of the tablelands.
“Two Seas” : Riding home-
ward after putting a mob of
shorn sheep back in their pad-
dock, we passed a few cattle, and
’Arold, my new assistant, re-
marked, “I don’t see how it can
pay to shear cattle.” I didn’t
laugh, for much experience of
’Arold had taught me to take
him seriously if I didn’t wish to
miss any of the joke, so I merely
inquired gravely, “What makes
you think it doesn’t pay?”
“Well, it doesn’t look as if
you’d get enough hair off ’em to
pay for shearing ’em,” was the
reply. “Ever see cattle getting
shorn?” “No,” drawled ’Arold;
“I can’t say I’ve exactly seen it,
but, of course, I know they do
shear ’em.” In my mind’s eye I
saw the shearers dragging bullocks
out of their pens and sitting them
up on their tails while they ran
tthe blades over their belly wool.
But I preserved my wooden expres-
sion with an heroic effort and
asked, “How do you know ?”
“Why,” retorted ’Arold, “’aven’t
I seen the hair they got off ’em?
-—’aven’t I seen plasterers mix-
ing it with their plaster?” That
settled the argument, and, so far
as I know, ’Arold still believes
cattle-shearing to be one of our
industries that are governed by
an award. I ought to mention
that ’Arold isn’t a “Pommy”—
he was born and bred in Sydney,
where all the smarties who in-
vent the yarns about Woop Woop
were born. But ’Arold is no invention. He is our
chief amusement in the bush, and consoles us for
the absence of Charlie Chaplin.

“G uidepost”: Doing a round of wallaby-
snares yesterday I found a Oft. carpet-snake looking
very worried. He had swallowed a snaie, also the
half-grown “black jack” wallaby. The
snare was tiod to a 3in. sapling about 12ft. high.
No, he hadn’t started to swallow the sapling when I
arrived, and with all due respect to his ability I’m
damn’d if I think he could have swallowed it if he
had started.
“W.J.8.”: An old chap I was boarding
with in the Pilliga scrub (N.S.W.) rode home one
night after dark. Next morning one of his boys
came in with the news
that his pony had a broken
leg. “I heard it crack
three miles back at Werah
Creek,” commented the old
man. I laughed at the
idea; but have since
learned it is possible for a
horse to travel a consider-
able distance after its leg
has been cracked and be-
fore the prop finally gives
way. 1 was travelling
from Grafton to Glen
Innes per coach, and on a
dangerous cutting we came
to a horse lying in the
middle of the road with a
broken leg. The driver
told me that coming down
the “Big Hill,” two miles
farther on, the previous
evening, the horse fell and
the wheel went over its
leg near the fetlock. He.
got it going again, a bit
lame, but it 'kept getting
worse till he Was obliged
to leave it at the spot
where it was now lying.
We could not possibly get
past, so the only thing- left
was to roll the prad over
the cutting. At that
moment two men came
along, one of them carrying
a rifle. The driver put -i
bullet "into the hag’s head,
but too low, and the horse
struggled to its feet.
They had no more cart-
ridges. The Jehu got a
stick to knock the animal,
but at every blow the poor
old . neddy ducked. My
handkerchief was requisi-
tioned to blindfold him,
and the next whack did
the trick. We rolled him
over, still kicking, and lis-
tened to him bumping to the bottom.
“Ivobbi”: On South Keppel Island (Q.)
I found under a sheltering ledge in a mountain
gorge, admirably protected from the
monsoonal weather, about a score of
pieces of wood tapering from a wide
end of about 3in. to a blunt point.
They had been chipped into shape,
and to me seem to have been the
hard core of the grass-tree bole. A
coating of red-ochre gives them a
Sundav-best appearance. Some were
large and others small, but the majo-
rity were about 10 or 12 inches long.
Binghi, who once lived on the island,
has long departed, but these bits of
shaped wood are obviously samples of
his handiwork. Some think that he
used them as a sort of tally-sheet of
his dead ancestors, the big ones repre-
senting the departed adults, and the
midgets standing for piccaninnies.
Anyone know anything about ’em ?

“Keystring”: I shuddered
when I read in “Jimmy Possum’s”
par. (B. 16/8/’23) that he knew of
two instances where it was necessary
to take hold of the tails of neddit-s
when catching them. Many years ago
in Lismore (N.S.W.) a so-called pro-
fessional horse-tamer used to lecture
on, among other things, the way to
catch a horse. One of his contentions
was that it was natural for a moke
to turn his rear, or offensive, end
when approached, and, consequently,
a man should first put a hand on the
animal’s rump. A friend of mine
tried this one Sunday morning with
a nag he had bought on the previous
afternoon. Result: A kick over the
heart, a young widow and a funeral
next day. Yes, give me the, other
end —even if the brute does “stiike.”
“Sucre” : Apropos the word “merino.” The
Saturday Magazine of 8/11/1834 had this: “The
name of Merino signifies in the language of Spain
ambulatory, wandering. During May of each year
millions of sheep leave the plains of Estremadura,
Andalusia, Old Castile and Leon, and are conducted
by shepherds to the mountainous regions of Biscay,
Navarre and Aragon. The fierce summer heat on
the plains of Estremadura, Andalusia, etc., destroys
the vegetation, and sheep-owners are forced to the
mountains with their flocks. Under the guidance of
an association called the Mesta, these annual peregri-
nations are conducted. Forty to fifty thousand
shepherds are employed. The head serang is styled
a ‘mayoral’ and draws a salary of £6O p.a.; the rest
of the shepherds draw 30s. a month. The sheep
have a right of entry a nd pasturage to the mountain
pastures. They cannot enter upon cultivated ground,
but the landholders are obliged to reserve them a
passage 270 ft. wide. The Mesta has its own fixed
laws and a tribunal called the Honorable Council
of the Mesta. It is composed of four judges and
a president.”
“Kay”: I couldn’t send along this entry
for the Queer Accident Stakes before, because it
happened only the other day. A mate of mine in
the Atherton (N.Q.) district had a bad-tempered
colt that would stand very quietly while being
approached and then in a flash would wheel on his
fore feet and lash out with both heels. The owner
tried all the recognised methods to break him of
this bad habit, but it was no good. One morning,
his patience sorely tried, he pelted the prad with
the first thing that came to hand —a piece of 3in.
x 2in. hardwood Sin. long. The horse was 15ft.
away and. as the bit of timber came towards him
he lashed out with both heels. The kick was timed
to a nicety. One of his hooves struck the missile
squarely, and it came lack and hit the thrower on
the forehead. After a medico, had put four stitches
in his head my cobber took a few days’ spell in
hospita l .
“Pantagruel”: Big rats? Rockhampton
(Q.) City Council officials recently caught one meas-
uring 2ft. llin. from tip to tip, beating Sydney’s
largest rodent by nearly 2 Ain. The tail, which was
white for half its length, taped 9iin„ the whiskers
24in., and the fur (fawn and black), lin.
“Two Seas”: There are still some tough
old horse-breakers on active service in spite of the
evil effects of a heavy meat diet in a tropical climate.
Fred Myron, of Yamburgan (Q.), is one of the tribe.
Although Fred owns up to 73, he is still teaching
young horses not to root, lie was formerly break-
ing in youngsters of the once-famous “LL” brand on
old Burburgate station, hear Gunnedah (N.S.W.).
which was the bone of contention in a lengthy law-
suit years ago. By the way, old hands still swear
that it was a Burburgate manager who was astounded
at receiving a wire from the Sydney office to “post-
pone the lambing.”
“Trcvdee” : Two giant sheep were yarded
at Newmarket yards (Vie.) the other day. One
stood 3ft. high, and weighed 2001 b., the other was
2ft. 9in. tall, and 1951 b. weight. But even these
were midgets compared with a wether killed at
Shepparton recently. After the butcher had cleaned
and dressed him there was still 1651 b. of mutton on
the hooks.
“Bora”: “Cooralco’s” sheep (B. 2/8/’2. r >)
arc certainly remarkable, but — Some years ago a Nen
England (N.S.W.) .breeder as an experiment ran a
flock of 30 sheep (studs) in a paddock for 12

months without water. The jumbueks did quite all
right. The only moisture they got was from green
feed and dew on the grass —and no doubt, they put
their heads well back when it rained.
“Pat Bushie”: “Nosredneh” is talking
through his hat (B. 16/8/’23) when he insinuates
that a kookaburra will drown in a very small
quantity of water. I saw one diving into a trough
6ft. long, and containing water a foot deep. After
each dive he appeared on the rim at the opposite
end, chuckled heartily, flapped his wings and dived
again. While shooting out back I saw one skim
down into an almost dried-up tank, disappear under
the water’s surface, then rise again with a small
fish. Jack’s just as fond of a plunge as any other
bird. Of course, he might meet with trouble if he
tried to swim Rurrinjuck Dam.
THE UGLY MAN OF ILFRACOMBE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Longreach (C.Q.) is conducting an Ugly Men’s
Competition in aid of the district hospital.”
A stranger came to Ilfracombe
Upon the mailman’s car ;
He had a fibre dressing-case,
A Flor de Goat cigar.
His boots were bull-nosed purple ones,
His coat was long and split;
The sun had tanned his shaven neck ;
He was, and looked, a Hit.
Upon his forehead simian
Reposed neat oily curls;
He wore synthetic diamonds
To fascinate the girls.
His brummy pince-nez, on a chain,
He hitched to either ear;
His rugged adamantine jaw
Denoted lack of fear.
He had small, hostile, shifty eyes
Like those of hunted swine ;
His iridescent nose bespoke
A love of sparkling wine.
Ilis ears were battered, thick and red,
His mouth a shapeless cave,
And any who offended him
Were either fools or brave.
A Longreach man, who knew him not,
Came down to find a face
Far uglier than any in
That dusty Western place.
lie was informed by ev’ryone
All are Apollos here,
When in a bar he chanced to see
The stranger, drinking beer.
“He’s mine! He’s mine—Eureka, boys!
The competition’s won!”
He slapped the stranger on the back,
And said, “You take the bun !
Ben Snippet is a Never Was!
And Jones an also-ran.”
lie turned and shouted in his glee—
‘‘Australia's ugsy man l”
The stranger put his pewter down
Upon the sloppy bar. ■
“Familiar blokes like you,” he said,
“my finer senses jar.”
He clenched a pair of knotty fists
And, murmuring “Here goes.”
Delivered half a ton upon
The other’s tender nose.
The Longreach man went down and out;
He weltered, in a trance ;
And some kind person thought to call
The Longreach ambulance.
They took him back into the ’Reach,
And no one thought to cheer.
The stranger leant against the bar
And finished off his beer. ‘ r

Roy McDonald, M.L.C., who has persisted
in bachelorhood until he had been mentally
labelled “habitual,” upset all calculations
during last week. He carried his honors as
shrinkingly as the modest violet, and th ll
knot was tied by Canoii Langley with the
soft pedal on at All Saints’. The lady in the
case, May Camille Dezarnaulds, is just 20
—a striking beauty, half-Scotch, half-French,
whose family, now at Double Bay, came
hither from Noumea. The wedding frock
was a shimmery affair of silver brocade that
trailed a Court train of cloth of silver. Sis-
ters Mimi and Louisette followed the bride
in quaint dresses of shot taffetas in pinks
and silvery blues. Bride’s mother, in glit-
tering black, dispensed the wedding meats,
the French Consular Campana couple graced
the party, and Roy’s only sister, Mrs. Clunies
Ross, was there to fling the time-honored
slipper.
Bert Birtles, the young man who was
“sent down” from the Uni. for writing
“Beauty,” the poem that carried the circula-
tion of Hermes to its dizziest height, has
since his “descent” been married. The lady
is Dora Toll, an undergrad., who wields a
fevered quill herself. Some of her verse
was in the same Hermes as “Beauty.” The
young man, who is studying philosophy, but
wasn’t entered for a degree course, has a
job in Tooth’s.
Two brass-plates can merge into one now
that Mosman girl Dr. Lorna Beveridge is
married to Dr. 1.. L. Holland, of Macquarie-
street. The wedding happened in a whisper
at St. Stephen’s on Saturday night. To
cheer the pair the stars shone suddenly forth
from a week of cloud-enveloped nights ; and
a handful of friends dropped in on their way
to theatres and concerts to buzz congratula-
tions at th.e tail ivory-satined bride and her
new husband. Two equally upstanding sis-
ters of Lorua’s, one in powder-blue, the other
jn yellow satin frocking, made up the pro-
cession. The strictly family party gambolled
at the Cavalier.
Ex-world champion sculler Jim Stanbury,
of Ryde, had a wedding in his family the
other day, when second-daughter Mabel
(Mainey) gave her hand and heart into the
keeping of Fred Hicks in that same Baptist
Church at Ryde of which Fred’s grand-
father was the first pastor. Red and white,
.Tim Stanbury’s old rowing colors, and a pair
of his rowing sculls were used in the decora-
tions of the Ryde Town Hall, where nearly
150 guests made merry after the knot-tying.
Mainey, in her single days, was chief-typist
in the Repat.
;The Eastern Suburbs had a pretty wed-
ding last week, when Eileen Younger, of
Summer Hill, and Herbert John Charley were
linked at the smithy of St. Andrew’s, where
padre Searcy and a full choir saw to the
riveting. Eileen billowed up the aisle on
father’s arm in one of those new-old flowing
skirts that suggest hoops, the upper rigging
being of the fitting draped variety. There
was a train of Limerick lace over rosy geor-
gette, and this was sleuthed up the aisle by
two bridesmaids, May Bull and bridegroom’s
sister Nell. Their frocking was a souffle of
vellum lace over rich greeny-blue moire; their
black hats flew long black velvet streamers,
and they were further embellished by black
baskets glowing with red and pink blooms.
Later on the bride’s father and mother ex-
changed cake and trimmings for congratula-
tions at the Cavalier. The bridegroom comes
from Belmont Park, Richmond.
Molly Owen and Ted Knox are among the
matrimonial entries for September. Ted’s
sister Nora, however, isn’t going to wed
her young man—he’s one of the Streets —
for a bit. She’s off for a trip to England
and the Continent. first.
David Blair Hunter, who traffics in law
with the largest smile in the world, has asked
Margery Rutherford to allow him at some
future date to bestow on her all his legal
fees and pickings. Margery is publishing
her consent by flying the usual diamond en-
sign. Her dad is the Point Piper medical
man; and everybody knows Percy Hunter,
the young man’s father.
The Royal Colonial Institute lecture-hall
presented a dashing sight the other evening,
when about 200 enthusiasts poured in from
the lift and up the stairs to welcome Esther
Anderson, the new national secretary of the
Y.VV.C.A. Girl Guides illustrated one rea-
son of their being by cleverly ushering the
audience down the aisles. Never did Sydney
woman pass through such an ordeal of wel-
coming speeches. With Mrs. It. M. Sly in
the chair, the new arrival was pelted with
posies from every angle. Flowers of speech
from the clergy, women’s organisations,
business men and the Y.M.C.A. were twined
into a chaplet for her hair, which nearly-
new American Consul Lawton finished off, as
it were, with a jaunty little American flag.
And under it all Miss Anderson remained
sweet and uncurdled, and returned thanks
in a voice very pleasing to the ear.
Popularity seems to be the slogan of the
monthly parties at the Royal Colonial Insti-
tute. Even the depressing drizzle under
which Sydney sulked last week couldn’t keep
the crowds away. They breasted the en-
trance hall, wall-papered like some Chinese
tapestry, as eagerly as if it were a Mae
Murray matinee. The Denison lady did the
honors, assisted by her knight, and by mil-
linery built on the latest large scheme of
architecture. In the reception-rooms pink
carnations and stocks swooned their life away
in heady incense, and Mrs. George Earp and
Beulah Bolton buzzed about helping in the
general scheme of enjoyment.
Good old Sydney public! This week the
cheque from the Allied Nations’ Ball was
handed over at Government House to the
Royal Hospital for Women- —it was for
£lOOO. And one morning, at the Australia,
Bee White modestly owned that her fund
for St. Margaret’s had reached £l4OO, of
which Acting Deputy-Governor Ilulle, of the
Commonwealth Bank, produced £7OO on the
spot. The idea is to get £l5OO in all; and
Clay Smith, under the hypnotic influence of
his big wife, promised, if the fund fell short
of his lady’s objective, to make up the differ-
ence out of his own cr. bal. They are both
life governors of the hospital now; and sister
Kerven and matron Abbo,tt, who founded the
hospital with two beds in one small ward,
want the next new ward named after the
lady.
The Mater Hospital Ball was one of the
successes of last week. Hundreds packed
themselves into the Wentworth in the cause
of the popular North Sydney hospital. Hos-
tessing- one of the biggest parties was Dr
Dan Kelly’s wife, in black tulle frocking.
Inter-State visitors and a group of the Mil-
waukee officers cheered her board. Trea-
surer Mrs. P. Leahy, who is a tireless worker
on the hospital’s committee, smiled over the
only presentation bouquet of the evening. It
came to her from her fellow-workers.
October 2. Mark the date on your ivory
tablets, and have the buckles of your sandals
polished and the clasps of your tunics re-
jewelled in readiness for the Olympic Ball
at the Town Hall. Myrtle green and gold
ar c to be the color-notes of the decorations,
and Dame Margaret is looking in to present
the prizes.
May Moore’s camera netted a notable catch
when it recorded Mrs. Rose-Soley, widely-
known in the years gone by as Rose de
Boheme. As a girl the little lady came to
Sydney fresh from Cambridge and journal-
istic work in
London, and
started to
earn her living
by her pen.
She was pro-
bab 1 y Syd-
ney’s first
bachelor-
woman, with
flat and latch-
key complete,
and if not
the original
woman - jour-
nalist of the
city, she was
among the
pioneers.
Bailey’s Sun-
day News
was the paper
into which she
poured articles,
stories and
verse, and that was so long ago that she
did most of her night-work by candle-light.
After her marriage Samoa claimed her, and
later Southern California and London. On
her return to Australia she started on her
big work, the founding of the Lyceum Club,
which is sister to the famous London and
Paris institutions. By this she has done
more to foster art and letters among the
women of Australia than would be possible,
perhaps, in any other way. The gifted and
energetic lady is publishing a new book of
poems under th e title of “Stray Chords.”
The Town Hall will be filled with all the
scents of Araby on the night of the Operatic
and Carnival Ball in aid of the Hospice for the
Dying. The powder-and-perfume merchants
are showering gifts as prizes for entries in
the Costume Stakes; and in addition every
lass in attendance will receive a box of face-
powder. But, of course, there’s a catch : no
money returned on the empties.
The Prisoners’ Aid Society occupied Gov-
ernment House ballroom the other day; but
high jazz had no share in its thoughts. It
was holding an annual review of itself, and
in no time was deep in consideration of the
problem of how best to set the discharged
prisoner on a path that leads away from
the slippery places. The management of
the women’s section at Long Bay called
forth a round of hosannas from various
speakers, one of the most interesting of these
being the lately-returned Mrs. Arthur Las-
setter. Miss Emily Cox, who has been
president of the Society for many years, took
the opportunity of retiring in favor of the
widely-travelled Mrs. Arthur.
Wouldn’t you like to congratulate W.
Arundel Orchard, the State Conservatorium’s
new Director?
Well, here’s
Ma y Moore’s
excellent pic-
ture of him.
He left Lon-
don for Maori-
land in 1901,
and sought our
sunnier cli-
mate two years
later. He has
conducted or
played for
p r a c t i c ally
every Sydney
musical body
during the
past 20 years.
From his pen
have come
many madri-
gals, glees and
orchestral
numbers,
though his longest work is a cantata, “Tiller
the Bowman.” The number of his pub-
lished works he admits modestly are nothing
to exclaim over ; and the same can be said
for his golf. That, apart from his music, is
his only vice. Mr. Orchard’s brave attempt
to reconstruct the Conservatorium Orchestra
from amateur ranks is being followed with
great interest.
The society whose principal care is the
deaf and dumb foregathered in the White
and Gold room of the Mary Elizabeth on
the invitation of the Chief Justice’s lady one
afternoon last week. The society is anxious
to devise some plan of collecting whereby
the £15,000 necessary for the new hostel will
be garnered. Organising-sec. Mrs. Ida
Charles outlined the campaign, to which
the crowded room, including Dr. Storie Dix-
son, turned an attentive ear. Dame Mar-
garet Davidson, from her violet-strewn tea-
table, had a word of sympathy for the move-
ment, and Dr. Storie Dixson called on all
interested to press the Government to pass
a bill making the education of the deaf and
dumb compulsory.
If you, like most of the rest of us, know
nothing of the delicate art of the Japanese
prints of Hiroshige or Kimisada, circa 1800,
and if you are equally well-informed as to the
woodcuts by Australia’s artists round about
1923, call in at Tyrrell’s in Elizabeth-street
and confirm your worst suspicions. The
whole world seems to be woodcutting at
high pressure—and small pay, judging by the
modest prices. Only a few of the intriguing
prints run to more than a pound.
Dr. Charles MacLaurin is a very sad man
these days. He and his wife are sorrowing
over the death of Mrs. MacLaurin’s sister,
Safa Gordon Croal, who had joined them
at Rose Bay only a few months ago. The
thrust is all the sharper as the end came
very unexpectedly. Unlike most of the rest
of the little household Miss Croal had no
literary output; but she had gentle qualities
that endeared her to her circle.
The very oldest musical generation of Syd-
ney will remember Mrs. Aspinall-Thiodon,
prominent in musical circles half a century
ago. In the first ’seventies a small party
occupied the School of Arts Hall in Pitt-
street, with the late Lewis Scott as lecturer
and Mrs. Thiodon as principal vocalist. The
lady, who afterwards became Mrs. Cleary,
died at Omrah a few days ago, aged 75.
Sydney society is pondering over the fact
that a great actress can be as natural off-
stage as a schoolgirl, and far shyer and more
unassuming than the average deb. Lady
Forbes Robertson, whose charm on the stage
is as refreshing as a whiff of boronia, is prov-
ing just as girlish with the make-up off as
with it on. At a party the other night a
Society flapper remarked : “On the stage she
never seems to be acting, and off the stage
she never talks about herself. She’s too
good to be real!”
In November Mrs. Bertie Kelly leaves
with her chicks for England. There’ll be
some wanderings in Egypt and elsewhere on
the way. Luxor will be the family camp
for a fortnight. It’s to be hoped that archi-
tect-daughter Beatrice will not take the
tombs as models for flatteries in Sydney,
lhey’re much too roomy, and would only
cause discontent in Darlinghurst. The lad
from Eton joins his family somewhere in
the torrid zone; and then the family goes
north in search of an English summer. It
is optimism such as this that makes the
British nation great.
The feminine interest of the White City
has centred this past week in the new Mrs.
OHara Wood, who was the youthful widow
Lister when she married her tennis-cham-
pion. Before her first marriage she was
Beryl Waxman, a daughter of Melbourne’s
barrister Louis. On one of the rare after-
noons of sunshine last week she cheered
the Sydney courts with Alice Blue frocking
and a Spring hat of the Dolly Varden sister-
hood.
The big private flutter fixed for Race
W eek is the Macartliur Onslow dance at the
Rose Bay Golf Club.
Mrs. Rosita Forbes (now Mrs. McGrath
on the domestic hearth) belongs to a Lincoln-
shire family of dashing cross-country riders,
and rode to hounds at the age of six or
thereabouts. When she was in Sydney some
years ago her home out Point Piper way
was burgled. The unexpected visitor got
away with a few things worth while, but
missed quite a lot of diamond ornaments. The
lady, who was young and careless, had tossed
some of her frocks into a wardrobe, and left
in them some of her best gauds. Now the
cables say that the lady is daring fate in
veiled Moslem hiding-places.
Recently returned from a trip round the
world, Dr. E. A. Bligh, of Wollstonecraft.
Bligh one day in London asked a tall stran-
ger with a red beard for the correct time, or
something such, and next week, on opening
a society paper, was astonished to see him-
self and the stranger depicted in a two-
column photograph with the legend: “Mr.
Bernard Shaw talking with a friend.”
A Brisbane postscript:—
Sir Matthew went off to Toowoomba for Polo
Week, and now has a trip to the Barrier Reef along
with some of the Pan-Pacific Congressers in his
vice-regal eye. Before leaving he gave a dance to
the officers of the Fleet. The warships departed
after that shivoo. The dance which was to have
being held on the Melbourne was cancelled, and
regrets trailed in the vessel’s wake.
Another Government House affair was a gay dinner
party, Norah Halford, Jim Brown, Hal L’Estrange,
Rodney Graham and T. H. Brown being among the
guests. Afterwards motors carried the lot to Thelm i
Robertson’s ball to help the Lady Lamington funds.
The South Brisbane City Hall blossomed in red roses,
many flags and a choice assortment of Iceland poppies,
and Victoria Drummond (the ship’s-engineer lady),
Quail (of the Anchises), Commodore Addison and
a lot of other naval men turned up.
Sir Matt, got to Toowoomba in time for the
R.S.S.I.L. Ball, whereat Ethel Campbell of Durban
was starred. During the proceedings a wicker-work
ball opened over “The Angel’s’’ head and covered
her with fragrant confetti. On the following day
she came up to Brisbane and went to a gala night
at the Theatre Royal to see Nellie Bramley in “The
Lion and the Mouse” —the show being billed as “the
Diggers’ farewell to Ethel Campbell.”
Toowoomba weather wasn’t pleasant for the polo
onlookers, but Sir Matthew, Mrs. Pitt Rivers, the
Coochin Bells, Ross Munroes and the Feezes braved
it. The Spinsters’ Ball, held in the Show-ground
pavilion, was also graced by Society; and during
the week the Leslie Buchanan widow (he was killed
in France) and Leslie Drew were responsible for
“The Geisha” in the Town Hall.
Gerardy and his ’cello, at the Exhibition Conceit
Hall, didn’t get the houses they deserved. Until
Brisbane can sport a Town Hall with a good con-
cert room this sort of thing is always likely to
happen. Even genius can’t bank on success at the
Exhibition Hall.
The N.S.W. bowlers dined their Queensland oppo-
nents at the Bellevue amid sweet-pea and maroon
streamers, with blue and white to represent N.SAV.
Percy Sapsford scored a white ivory dressing-table
set during the affair, over which “skipper” Wall of
N.S.W. presided.
The ball at the Hillcoats’, given as a lift to the
Seamen’s Institute, scored a success. The G. A,
Curtis and Hillcoat. ladies, both in black gowns,
hostessed, and there was a vice-regal party on the
floor.
Sir Matthew supped Emelie Polini, Frank Harvey,
Hatteras and a theatre-going party at Govern-
ment House the other Sunday night; and the day
before the , Bruches gave a jazz afternoon at the
Barracks, when the jazzers included quite a lot of
gold braid from the warships.
May McQuade, elder daughter of the P. McQuades
of Drayton, was married at St. Luke’s, Toowoomba,
on Thursday to Major F. T. Devenish Meares, of
Ashfield, Sydney. The church was crowded, the
bride, who has spent most of her life in Toowoomba,
being one of the most popular girls there. The
wedding frock was of cream brochS satin, and the
wedding veil (lent by Mrs. Shepperd, of Drayton)
was of priceless Brussels net. Sister Nell McQuade,
in coral pink brochfi satin and a hat of silver lace,
was a decorative bridesmaid, and Captain Neville
Hatton was the ’groom’s corner-man. The ’moon is
being spent in Sydney and at the Caves.

“Mr. Pim” commenced late at the King’s
on Saturday owing to the tardy arrival of
Acting-Excellency Irvine. He strolled in
shine minutes after 8 accompanied by his
lady, a couple of flappers and a smiling frag-
ment of his suite. They sat in a d.-c. box,
the lady’s plain black looking mid-Victorian
in contrast to the fabulous confection of
Mrs. Tallis in the box below. She looked
like the inside of a furnace, in a wrap of
flaming tangerine velvet, and the effect Was
so wonderful that not a glass could be spared
for the examination of the exquisite Tommy
Cochran, who was sitting near by. Realising
that the time allowed for the Passing by of
Mr. Pim hardly permitted her to make a
change of raiment, Irene Vanbrugh stuck
to a white silk frock with a deep edge of
lace to the skirt; but the fried-egg effect of
the door-curtains, which play a minor part
in the comedy, gave her all the color she
needed. Joan Crossley, tightly gripped in
a Royal Drawing-room uniform, just beat an
ornately-gilded apartment for the feature
prize in the Barrie playlet.
While the Pan-Pacific Science Congress
was sitting in Melbourne, a number of lady
doctors and skirted scientists met one morn-
ing to hear a lecture of special interest to
the sex. The meeting-place was alongside
one of the suburban State schools, and, the
lecturer being a trifle unpunctual, one of the
teachers present suggested that the wait
might be filled in by a recitation from one
of the schoolchildren. A juvenile was
promptly impounded, and instructed to stand
up and elocute. She mounted the dais and
recited four verses of “Be good, sweet maid,
and let who will be clever.” It was some
minutes before the singular felicitousness of
the selection dawned upon the audience.
Dr. Howard I’raagst, only son of the late
Brighton medico and grandson of the late
Howard Willoughby, of the Argus, was mar-
ried to Kitty Inglis in the Collins-street
Scots Kirk the other evening. The bride,
convoyed by stepfather A. C. Gibb, was
curtained in white brocade, cob webbed with
gold and chained midway with pearl and
gold ornaments. Orange blossoms anchored
her tulle veil, while a golden posy flirted
with her left ear, and she carried more
blossoms in a gold posy-holder which be-
longed to her great-grandmother. Florence.
Mummery and Hilda P'ye bridesmaided, in
blue, with silver lace under silver-banded
head-veils. The Grantley and Morgan medi-
coes and F. James took charge of the ’groom.
The cake-cutting was at the Quamby Club.
Mrs. Gibb wore black satin with jetted
effects under an osprey-laden hat. Mrs.
Praagst was in powder-blue crepe peppered
with shiny heads, under a lace wrap, and
wreathed her head with pale leaves. Her
sister, Mrs. Norman Paxton, was also in
black, but she lightened it with a wreath
of green.
Mrs. H. J. Robertson, who succeeds Mrs.
Russell Gahb as president of the Women’s
Automobile Club, spread tea and song in the
rooms the other day. Doris Mclnnes. Victor
Baxter and Bert Sutcliffe headlined the musi-
cal bill, and it was further gladdened by the
pure-toned contralto of Mrs. Robertson her-
self. The hostess was in grey-brocaded crgpe
topped by a black hat; and sighted in the
gathering were her mother, Mrs Reid, Mrs.
Harry Vial, Mrs. T. Lambert and Mrs.
James Angus.
Tennis champion Gerald Patterson is a
proud father, so that makes Nellie Melba a
grand-aunt as well as a grandmother (and
the Indomitable One still plays Marguerite !).
Friends are wondering if the newcomer will
develop the famous blue eyes and golden
hair of Gerald’s mother, Mrs. Tom Patterson.
Nell, the champion’s sister, is driving her
own car through the highways of Europe
under the eye of aunt Mrs. Box.
Among those trippers whose friends were
alarmed by the news of the Japanese earth-
quake are the Byron Moores’ eldest and
youngest daughters—the Ronald Gordon
widow and sister Grace. They were
at the Japanese capital when last
heard of, but intended journeying northward
about the end of August. Mrs.. Pat McCau-
ley, of Hawthorn, with her younger daugh-
ter, Lena, was also spending a few weeks
in Japan, but news is to hand that he had
sailed homeward before the ’quake came.
Mrs. McCauley is one of the chief props of
the Broadmeadows Foundling Home. No
news is to hand of the 45 sisters from the
Malvern Convent who transferred to the
Tokio branch, established 15 years back,
although it is thought that the place, which
stands in the high ground west of the
stricken city, may have escaped disaster. One
of the nuns, Sister Mary Henderson, is a
sister of Mrs. Sep Miller.
Teddy Cahill writes breathlessly of the
first public appearance he and George Brooke
made in London. “Quite wonderful!” he
says. “We were anxious, of course, but
luckily both of us were in good form. Still we
didn’t deserve the greeting we got when it
was all over: the reception surpassed every-
thing we had ever hoped for.” Press-cut-
tings show that it was a great night for the
Australian hoys. The Pall Mall says “the
two were called six times before the
curtain and made to deliver a speech. [lt
was at the Victoria Palace.] The pair
make a turn that is assured of a hearty wel-
come in whatever part of the country they
may find themselves.” Captain Bruce
Bairnsfather, by the way, was in the pro-
gramme, telling the story of “Old Bill” with
tongue and pencil.
As hon. representative of the British Musi-
cal Society in this State, Mrs. Jimmy Dyer
set the stage at her Toorak home on Friday
night for a discourse on modern musical
conditions by the big-gun visitor, Dr. Whit-
taker. The discourser gave chapter and
verse for his text: “England is now the
greatest musical factory in the world.” The
hostess, who flew vivid red hangings, with a
single rose in her hair, spoke the introduc-
tory words, and Fritz Hart voiced the speech
of thanks. Then came supper, spread in two
sectors —the one under the shade of a small
potted almond-tree and the other on a table-
cloth of green moss with a gold-fish bowl
in the centre and marigolds all about. The
Barrett dame sat with the star-guest and
several other musical lights. The Bernard
Hall pair were there; also the Riddell Stan-
leys, the medical Rudalls, Mrs. Hugh Pater-
son with daughter Esther Gill and her hus-
band, the Zelmans, Sutton-Crows—and so on.
Scotch College is puffing out its chest be-
cause Frank Clarke (President), Attorney-
General Arthur Robinson (leader) and H. I.
Cohen (unofficial leader) of our Uppah
Ghambah are all Old Boys.
The Alliance Frangaise’s September
“swarry” in the Anzac Hall was run on more
adventurous lines than its predecessors. Talk
and music provided the prologue to an even-
ing’s fox-trotting. Katie Liddle,, at the
piano, and Marjorie Bagge, in song items,
were responsible for the musical section, and
French Consul Turck did his oratorical bit
in complimenting Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, presi-
dent of the society, who was as a cooing dove
in silver grey.
This is Mrs. J. S. Reid, the Donald Mae-
kinnons’ elder daughter, who has stepped on
to the Inky Way with a playlet, “A Flat in
Town.” It was
produced by
the Mermaid
Players th e
other night,
when the
authoress and
Mrs. Apperly
filled the two
roles. The
youthful ma-
tron has
always inter-
ested herself
in matters out-
side the social
arena, and
during the
war (which
found her in
England) she,
then a cap-
able spinster,
did her bit
looking after
horses in the Remount Department, and
afterwards turned her hand to driving a
motor-lorry. If heredity goes for anything
Mrs. Reid should have a fair share of grey
matter, for both her parents are well equip-
ped. Her mother is the daughter of the
late Judge Bunny and sister of artist
Rupert. The photo was taken by Rem-
brandt.
Mrs. Toutcher, wife of the M.L.A. for
Stawell, and daughter Naomi are seeing the
sights on the Other Side. They arrived in
Florence to the sound of joy bells ringing in
honor of Mussolini, and the Fascisti were
there in enthusiastic swarms. A bored Eng-
lishman remarked that “the English wouldn’t
do this for their King and Queen, dammit.”
One of the bewhiskered enthusiasts heard
Mm, smiled genially and said : “Neither would
we, signor, for ours; but for Mussolini —ah!”
The Lost Dogs’ Home Committee staged
its annual meeting on Friday in a dungeon
in the Town Hall where a handful of doggy
enthusiasts were presided over by Justice
Schutt and his cheery smile. The original
foundation-stone was laid by a member of
the old Oscar Asche co., who, horror stricken
at Melbourne’s crying need for such an insti-
tution, roped in a big cheque with a matinee
at Her Majesty’s. A special vote of thanks
was handed out to the medico who operated
on and attended Fraser, the keeper, through
a long illness without charging a penny ; to
Maud Harvey, of the Thistle co., who helps
to keep down the bills with two bags of food
every week, and to the Vacuum Oil Co. for
contributions of fuel for the dog-carts. Head-
master Adamson said a few words as presi-
dent, and among the listeners were Mrs.
Arthur Payne, the wife of Prof. Skeats,
Mrs. Charles Officer, Judge Woinarski’s
sister, Mrs. King, Mrs. Haddon (wife of the
late Argus editor), lan Lamb, and veteri-
nary Dr. Kendall. The funds of the home
are to get a lift from a hall in the St. Kilda
Town Hall on September 28. The Mont-
gomery sisters and Maud Harvey have the
thing in hand, and crowds of the Very Best
have promised to be there.
Herewith Charles Fyshe, a musician
whose chief expressional instrument is the
organ. Tas-
manian . born,
he crossed to
the mainland
about 10 years
ago, got the job
of organist and
choirmaster at
the St. Kilda
Pres byterian
Church, and
has held it ever
since. For a
time Fyshe*
who took the
Mus. Bac. de-
gree at Mel-
bourne ’Var-
sity, acted as
lion, organist
with the Vic.
Festival Choir,
and later suc-
ceeded J. J.
Bailey as con-
ductor. In addition he is a member of the
Council and Examination Board of the Musi-
cal Society. As to his own instrumentalism,
only the other night he gave a recital in the
Town Hall, at which he made the organ run
a wide gamut of musical expression, from
the giddy joyousness, of Louis Lavater’s
“Hornpipe” to the thunderous elaborations of
the “William Tell” overture, with some charm-
ing modern numbers;and bits of Bach and
Mendelssohn sandwiched in between. Fyshe
showed himself a fine technician, mercifully
free from musical mannerisms, and the owner
of a soulful individuality which is ridden
well on the curb.
The 11 members of our reconstructed Cab-
inet are all natives of the State. Alec Pea-
cock (62), who is having his 12th turn in
a Government, is the oldest of the squad:
Gordon (60) is the only bachelor ; Wetten-
hall is the one with the fancy name—Marcus,
which naturally means he is nicknamed
Superbus.
Hugh Ward hosted a dance-tea for his Tan-
gerines at Bibron’s the other afternoon, when
they fox-trotted between tables giddy with
colored balloons, bon-bons loaded with paper
hats and other cabaret junk. The special
thrill was the Monte Carlo number, when
out-sized Jacks-in-the-box hopped out of the
prize packets. Harry Muller, the Princess’s
manager, brought his good-looking other half,
who deserves a Y.C. for valorously smiling
down the tragic moment when disaster, in
the shape of an overturned cup, sent a tidal
wave of coffee over the front of her dream of
a filmy grey frock. Mistress Minnie Hooper,
creamed in cloth tailorings, proudly watched
her pupils gyrate. Mamie Watson smiled
under an inky tam topping her black velvet,
with white arms glistening through filmy
sleeves. June Roberts buzzed round like a
radiant black-and-pink bird, while sister
Dorothy veiled her flapper angularity with
grey. Clarice Hardwicke masked her slim-
ness with bunched blue silk and thatched
her little head with roses. May Beatty, pale
but pheery after three weeks in a private
hospital, held a little court at her table.
Nancy McNaughton, the Queensland Judge’s
daughter, who understudies May, roofed
Paisley effects with a black hat.
Mrs. William Greene, who has laid the
foundation of many a dancing-star’s career,
is now convalescent after dreary weeks and
weeks of bed. Her eldest daughter, Mrs.
Rolls, came over from Westralia last month
to help her sisters, Mrs. Jim Purves and
Florrie Greene, to cheer up the invalid.
The Mayoress is warmly interested in
Charlotte Hemming’s coming effort in aid
of the Japanese Relief Fund, and she wants
all other people who feel the same way to
meet at the Town Hall to-morrow (Friday)
afternoon. . Charlotte Hemming had engaged
the Masonic Hall for Oct. 12 for a concert in
aid of herself. Years had elapsed since she
advertised a recital or took part in a con-
cert programme for other than a charitable
purpose; and this year the time seemed
npe for giving herself a benefit. But no
sooner was the hall engaged than the earth-
quake shook the world, and Charlotte Hem-
ming decided to give the proceeds of her
recital to the victims thereof.
Beauty contests organised in country dis-
tricts in aid of the local hospital or what
not have a sadly humorous interest for busi-
ness-men in Melbourne. Votes for beauties
are purchased with cash, and the Queen of
Loveliness is she who can command the
largest supply of donations to the charitable
institution. Even though a candidate’s
chance of victory is positively forlorn, owing
to one of the others having, perhaps, parents
in the hotel business who can collect the
price of votes over the bar, the backers of the
other lady will make it the temporary dream
of their lives to get her placed second or
third on the poll. So they unblushingly
write to any Melbourne merchant they buy
goods of and beg him to contribute a bit to-
wards making some neglected spinster or
other look beautiful on paper.
Nellie Billings, with a trunkful of mem-
ories of Italian skies and olive-skinned min-
strels, is in Paris on a musical orgy. She
manages to snatch a bite now and then, but
time is the essence of the contract, and she
wants to hear all she can.
All those who had been absent on sick
leave turned out for the last night of “Tan-
gerine,” at the Princess’s. The machine-
like regularity of the show was often broken
by festive impromptus from Mark Daly and
others, and there was a scene of unexampled
uproar when Austin, Lorna Pounds and Wee
Georgie Harris, from the neighboring Palace
show, invaded the proceedings looking for
the celebrated gir-r-raffe. At the end
there was the usual outburst of colored
streamers. Hugh Ward headed the line of
“parting-word” orators —the line included
graceful Mamie Watson, in a mauve costume
of stunning design. The sadness of the fare-
well was somewhat softened by the announce-
ment that the co, would probably eat its
Christmas dinner in Melbourne.
Mrs. Arthur. Baillieu and Mrs. Edward
Shackell are conspiring to hostess a dance-
party on September 25 at the latter’s Toorak
home, Vailima, when daughters Sunday Bail-
lieu and Aimee Shackell will peck their way
through their shells into the joyous swirl
of the first-grade younger set. The matrons
are sisters-in-law —Mrs. Shackell was a
Baillieu, and Mrs. Baillieu one of the big
Ham clan.
lan Macmeikan is being congratulated on
his engagement to Brighton lass Mary How-
son. He is the only son of John Macmeikan
and his late wife, who was a daughter of
the late naval-Captain and Mrs. Payne, of
South Yarra. The Captain, who was a
cousin of the Marquis of Normanby, one of
Vic.’s aforetime Governors, brought the old
flagship Nelson to Australia, and Mrs. Payne
was a leading hostess of the early ’eighties.
Some Adelaide gossip :
Mrs. W. A. Horn, who has been staying here
awhile after a long absence, gave a farewell at-
home to over 100 guests, at the Grand Central, the
other afternoon. She. is leaving again on September
20 for Papua, after which she returns to England.
The S.P.C.A. concert in the Town Hall, organised
by Mrs. Delmar Hall, brought in many bawbees. All
Adelaide’s prettiest girls sold flowers and sweets, and
the leading musical pros, bulged the programme ta
bursting point.
The Japanese earthquake proved a sad thing to
Hawkes, the Davis Cup tennis-player. His paren-
were in Yokohama, where they were awaiting, his
arrival for the proposed Japaftese tennis tournamenr
After the ’quake the son in Adelaide, J. B. Hawkes,
received a cable from the mother stating: “Dad
killed; absolutely stranded.” There were fears ror
the ex-Mayoress Moulden, who, with Miss Flo Davies,
of W.A., is on an Eastern jaunt, but reassuring
cables have since come from Manila.
The “Blue Birdj” dance at the Walkerville Hall
provided a gladsome time for the young people. A
point of originality was the revival of the chaperon.
The Muecke, Tippett and Rutherford matrons carried
through the new-old job successfully.
Sassiety rallied well to the dance in aid of Lady
Victoria Buxton’s Girls’ Club in Osborne Hall. Tne
decorations were limited to yellow petticoats on the
lamps; but the frocks outdid Solomon —-and some
were very Tut.
The two days’ Fete in the Town Hall will mean
a good cheque for the Babies’ and Boys’ Homes at
Walkerville and the Girls’ Home at Mitcham. Lady
Bridges, in powder blue with a dash of cerise,
opened the show, and all the worthy women in the
town lent a hand ; then bought of one another. A
bridge evening in the Mayor’s reception-room, super-
vised by Mrs. Finlayson, was rushed.
There was a jolly dance at Bucklands, the lovely
old home of the Farmer Hills, the other night, when
Alma Hill and five girl friends entertained about 50
youthful pals.
The Anglicans in S.A. are seriously considering
the idea of moving their men on from time to time,
as the Methodists do. There was strong opposition,
but the final voting in Synod, for appointing a
committee to go into the matter, was 2 to 1
among the clergy (the Bishop of Adelaide included
in the majority), and nearly 3 to 1 among the lay
members. One speaker in support neatly set. out
the case. The best, as the worst, no parish should
expect to keep for ever.

ESSEX
The Leading; Four-Cylinder Car.
Since its introduction in 1919 the career of the ESSEX has been one of consistent successes
in all manner of contests, all over the world. But it has not only distinguished itself by these
wonderful triumphs and records. Because of its performance, economy of upkeep and
unfailing service to owners, it has established itself in an impregnable position as the
leading pleasure and utility car. Below is the opinion of an ESSEX owner:—
“This will be of some interest to you to know that I have driven my Seven-
passenger Essex Car for 31,000 miles.
“During this period she has given me excellent service; I have travelled on all
sorts of roads and under all sorts of conditions, without giving the slightest trouble,
“I average over 22 miles per gallon of petrol. My tyre mileage is about 5000
to 6000.
“Apart from these good results this car has cost me nothing for mechanical
repairs, and is still going as good as ever. If ever I buy another car it will be an
Essex.
“1 can honestly recommend this car to anyone for any kind of use.
“I might also state I will only be 100 pleased to testify personally at any time
to their many good qualities.
“(Signed) E.'R. MORGAN,
“Lismore, N.S.W., 9/8/’23.”
The above is only one of numerous expressions of satisfaction received from ESSEX owners
throughout Australia, and each testifies to the reliability, economy, performance and
everlasting goodness of the ESSEX.

Sydney Tatt.’s Club had a beautiful early-
Spring day for its meeting at Randwick, but the
going was rather heavy, particularly when the Tram-
way Handicap and the Chelmsford Stakes were run.
On that account animals which failed to justify
their prominence in the betting should not be lightly
discarded. They may shape a lot better on a dry
track, in spite of the conditions being so much
against the heavily-burdened animals, Sunburst (lCst.
21b.) was made favorite far the seven-furlong Tram-
way, and The Hawk (9st. 121 b.) was next in demand.
Each threatened danger at the entrance to the
straight, but the
weight and the going
suited Vaccine (12V),
and the gelded son
of imported Sere-
in o n d - M i c r o be
streaked home two
lengths ahead of The
Hawk, from whom he
was receiving 3st., with
Salrak a good third,
Grotesque a fast-finish-
ing fourth and Sun-
burst —-battling it out
gallantly—fifth. Vac-
cine 'was here men-
tioned as “having a
distinct chance” in the
Epsom when the
weights were issued.
He has 7st. 71b. in the
rich mile handicap, but
the extra weight won’t
stop him, nor will the
additional furlong, if
the course is a bit
damp on Sept. 29. He
prefers it that way.
G. D. GREEN-
WOOD, owner of
Gloaming and
many other M.L.
horses.
Barosea is another horse that likes to feel the
ground give a bit when he is galloping. He also
runs well “first up,” and has a fancy for making
his own pace after the fashion of his brother, Prince
Bardolph. Heavy support for King’s Trumpeter, in
the 10-furlong Spring Handicap, enabled the shrewd
Barosea party to get 12's and 10’s for the solid
stake they sent into the ring, and they never had
a moment’s uneasiness, their useful quadruped lead-
ing all the way. Barosea has 7st. in the Metropoli-
tan, but will have to travel three furlongs farther
in much better company, and is not to be recom-
mended. He was chased home, at intervals of two
and four lengths respectively, by King’s Trumpeter
and Sandringham, with Keneppil at. the head of the
unplaced division. Keneppil exhibited glimpses of
his old form, and should soon be in the money.
Although speedy Wish Wynne saw to the pace in
the nine-furlong Chelmsford Stakes they took lmin.
55sec. to get over the nine furlongs—a clear indication
of the state of the going. Rapine (7’s), receiving t lb.
from David (same price), caught him in the last 50yds.
and had half a neck to the good when they flashed
past the judge’s box. It was a magnificent finish between
two rattling good horses, but David will be this
paper’s choice when they meet again over a distance,
and on firm ground. Rapine’s victory was due to
the superior horsemanship of Reed, the M.L. jockey
—at the crisis of the struggle he fairly out-rode
Wood. Wish Wynne lasted long enough to earn
third money for her owner, and behind her were the
three-year-olds, King Carnival, The Monk and Lady
Valais, with Furious handy. When this beautiful
mare won the Final Handicap at the Sydney Cup
meeting she was ridden by Robert Lewis. In her
two races this month she has had to carry unbrilliant
apprentices and lumps of lead. It is a remarkable
policy.
The three-year-olds are setting Derby punters the
problem now customary. Salitros won at outside
odds in 1920, Cupidon in 1921, and Rivoli last year;
and on none of these occasions was the form more
puzzling than it has been this season. Nevertheless,
the Randwick bookmaker may be confidently relieu
upon to offer the familiar dynamite odds. In spite
of the boosting he gets in gutter papers, he is a
gentleman who takes no unnecessary risks, ror looks
The Monk has all the others beaten, but at no stage
of the Chelmsford Stakes did the son of Absuut
flatter the mugs who backed him at 2 s and 6 to
4, only to see him recede to 9 to 2. Probably the
going bothered the big, long-striding customer, but
he has still to dispose of the doubt as to his staying
power. King Carnival’s showing was a great improve-
ment on his previous Saturday s run, when he lobbed
home last in a three-year-old handicap. One imagines,
however, that the ardent colt’s propensity for hitting
the front in the first furlong will have to be
mastered if he is to last out a mile and a hall witn
Bst. 101 b. up.
Valiant (7 to 4) won the Novice Handicap nicely,
but had nothing classy to beat. Tarleton’s second
to Larillo (6’s) in the mile Welter was more like
Derby form, since he gave the winner ilb. and a
long start in the straight, and would have been hrst
in a few more strides. Tarleton is decidedly the
best of the M.L. three-year-olds seen in Sydney, lie
is a big, shapely gelding by Nassau (imp.) Brayton,
and will probably stay. At the moment, however,
this page would rather risk its salary on Rahin than
on anv other Derby candidate. Also, it reckons
The Monk the smartest of the young milers when
the weather is fine and the going good.
It was hoped a week ago that Gloaming and Bean-
ford would meet again in the mile Hill Stakes at
Randwick next Saturday, but the old horse s pins
have been giving trouble, and he has been withdrawn
from all engagements. He may be patched up for
a sprint or two in M.L., but the Australian turf has
seen the last of him. In his absence, The HawK
may make a race of it with Beauford. Indeed, if
anything cuts at the Newcastle flier over the first
few furlongs, a win for The Hawk is Quite a possi-
bilitv —he will be all the better for another week s
work. With a first-class jockey aboard, Furious would
read well for the 11-furlongs Roseliill Handicap with
9st. 41b.. but rot if a stable-boy is given the mount.
In that case, lvingslot (Bst. 101 b.) or Keneppil c7st.
131 b.) might be preferred. A horse that is looking
very well these days is Oranian. There is a decent
handicap in this fellow, if shrewdly placed, but it iS
a waste of good currency to back him at w.f.a., as
many did last week.
* * *
There was a great race for 10 furlongs
at Mentone (Vic.), between Switch, a five-year-old
mare in Holt’s stable, and six-year-old Comedy
Star, trained by Bradfield. Switch won by a short
head, but the intervening six weeks will probably oo
more for Comedy Star than for the mare. Anyhow,
neither will be of grave importance whilst Easing-
wold, in Holt’s string, and Backwood or The Tyrant,
in Bradfield’s, remain in the market.
* » * *
“0.K.”: Two horses that threaten to be
conspicuous in Melbourne this Spring are Easingwold
and The Cypher. Unlucky last season, they may
both make amends this time. Easingwold _ sfa rted
auspiciously by running second to Maid of the Mist
in the Memsie Stakes. He is a fine-looking animal
in his fifth season, and his appearance suggested that
he was not nearly fit when Maid of the Mist beat
him. There’s no denying him a solid chance for the
Caulfield Cup with 9st. lib., more especially as he
has had a spell. Last year his party set him the
severe task of racing at Kalgoorlie in August and
September, at Caulfield in October, at Flemington
in November, and at Caulfield, Flemington and
Randwick in the Autumn. He was looking very
ragged at Easter, but ran quite a respectable third
to Purser and Whittier in the mile All-Aged Stakes,
w.f.a. # #
“Head-Collarer” : The pass to which pony-
racing has come in Sydney was revealed in a
statement attributed to “a leading pony-trainer,
that he had “twelve ponies in trainin’ an’ the boycott
has left me broke.” That was after the third “strike”
meeting. One marvels what the gentleman gets
per head for training his 12 champions if missing
three meetings sends him stiff. Also, whether he
backs them for half-crowns or ha’pennies when he
thinks they have a winning chance. According to a
nefarious rumor the strike was settled by certain
morose feed-merchants, who weighed in with the
Ultimatum “Pay what you owe, or go back to
work (!) and win something on account. ’ Then
there was a stampede.
* * * *
“15-30” : After a second reading of all the
available cables, I consider that the American victory
ever the Australians at Forest Hills looks bettei
than it really is. We won one match out of five,
but two of those lost were close enough to affect
the Yankee morale for the future, especially in view
of the fact that Australia wasn’t playing its best
team. With all due compliments to Tilden and
Williams for pulling out of a precarious position in
the doubles, I still think they were lucky to spin
out the argument to five sets. In addition to winning
the second and third sets, Anderson and Hawkes
were within a point of triumph in the prolonged
first chapter. Had they clinched this, as they might
have done under less exciting conditions, Anderson
would' have been in great heart for his contest
with Tilden. As it was, Tilden didn’t have such an
easy passage with the Cornstalk. His record
in the critical third set was I—6,1 —6, but
he managed to pull himself together sufficiently
in the fourth term to get home by 7
to 5. Plainly, he is little superior to Anderson in
nerve Against Johnston the Ma Stater performed
the unprecedented feat of serving up four consecu-
tive aces and following this up with a spasm of
brilliant play which gave him a lead of three-love.
The Davis Cup is once more within our reach.
Anderson has pricked the bubble of the two Bills’
invincibility. # #
“Half-Volley” : The death of his dad and
his old friend, Russell Keavs, in the Japanese earth-
quake must have been a terrible blow to Jack
Hawkes. Old Tom Hawkes, a popular sport in many
ways, gave the impetus to Jack’s tennis which
Keay’s afterwards developed by practice and tuition
on the Geelong courts. Both went to Geelong
College and there Jack followed Keays -in various
other athletic accomplishments, stiffening his muscles
and building his physique in foot-running, football
and cricket. A solid player himself, who, up to
the time of his leaving for his fatal trip, had
wielded a racquet for Geelong in pennant tennis,
Keays plugged up the holes in Jack’s game and
watched his progress with pardonable pride. It
was he that instilled into the boy the necessity for
constant rehearsals, and screwed him up to regular
work with an old racquet and ball against a wall.
Jack will sorely miss his good pal Keays.
S.A. Football .League has bad a brisk dis-
cussion on the necessity
for a team sent to an-
other State returning
all together. Some of
the men lately in
Melbourne were said to
have demanded leave
to stay on for a day
or two, and came back
so late that their
clubs suffered in the
next match. But prob-
ably there was more in
it than that. Adelaide
always dreads tempting
offers from Melbourne
for its best men. “Be-
fore you know where
you are, you are going
to have the eyes of the
State pecked out,” said
one delegate gloomily.
H. RILEY, of
Sturt, about the
finest high-mark
in S. Australia.
In Vic. League football on Saturday, Gee-
long, playing on their own ground, went under to
Essendon —54 to 62. But they put up a great fight.
A quiet, courteous game, which didn’t matter to
anybody, ended in Carlton getting 74 points to
Melbourne’s 46. South kept their place in the
procession by thoroughly hammering Richmond —
100 points to 55 ; and Collingwood, now at the top
of their form, wiped off old scores by gathering
84 points against Fitzroy’s 49. The position now
is that Essendon and Fitzroy are unalterably first
and second ; South Melbourne, St. Itilda and Gee-
long have won 8 games each, and Collingwood has
collected 74. Next Saturday the latter play Mel-
bourne and should win easily. Geelong meet Carlton,
and will be displaced bv ’Wood if they lose or draw.
Saints encounter South, and the winner will enter
the final four, while the loser will fade out. Should
they draw, ’Wood, having a better percentage of
points scored for and against, will push them both
out. *
“Tickle” : The action of South Melbourne
in protesting against the umpiring of McMurra.v,
recalls Richmond’s foolish (or heroic) deed of 1904.
Though minor premiers of the Association, they
were defeated by North Melbourne in the semi by
two points. During this match, their officials asked
the umpire (Allen) to ascertain whether the stops
worn by North were within the law, as several Tigers
had been wounded in a suspicious way. When cer-
tain Northerners refused to be examined he did not
press the charge, but let the game continue. Rich-
mond thereupon declared to the Association that he
he had not then nor at any previous time given them
a fair spin, and threatened to forego the right 'o
challenge if he were the umpire appointed to the
grand final. He was, nevertheless, the official chosen,
and though Richmond had a winning side—it included
“Mallee” Johnson, Charlie Ricketts and Jack Hut-
chinson—they kept their ; word, and forfeited the
game, the premiership and the gate-money>
“D.P.L.” : At a match in Horsham (Vic.)
on August 18, Toolondo v. Horsham Juniors, the um-
pire (Taylor, from Ballarat) was knocked out for
about 10 minutes by a clout:on the head from the ball
—it had been kicked off tjhe ground. I’ve seen umpires
hit out with fists and boots, and even bricks on
occasion, but it’s the first time in my experience that
a football has done the business.
“Forbes”: It was Basher, the Footswood
follower, and the subject of his discourse was Skinner
Smith, the hope and glory of the Fitzilda XVIII.
“Can’t make ’im out,” said the gloomy Basher.
“Last Satterdee me an’ Tripper Toughnut got to
’im in th’ ruck. Tripper gave ’im a boot to go on
with an’ I parssed ’im one on th’ .jaw. Instead or
makin’ a fuss, ’e spat out a couple o’ teeth, collared
th’ ball, and dashed down th’ field for a sixer. Never
went ter market once. Not a blinkin’ word! Th
game’s degeneratin,’ and I’m gointer git out of :t.
I ’ave an ’orrible feelin’ that th’ next bloke me
an’ Tripper manhandles ’ll kneel down and pray
for us.” #
Balmain prevented Eastern Suburbs from
adding another success to their sequence of 11, and
thereby making the Sydney premiership their property.
The Dockers won on their merits by 12 points (2
tries 3 goals) to 11 points (1 try 4 goals). Oxford
kicked all the losers’ goals, two of them being
snorters, and brought his score up to 42 for the
season. Only 14,000 witnessed a match that, in other
years, would have attracted twice that number.
East’s reverse necessitated their playing off with
South Sydney, that team having inflicted another
defeat on North Sydney.
Glebe-Balmain, by downing University (12 points
to 5), made a play-off necessary in the Rugby Union
competition. In the semi-final under Australian
Rules, Sydney defeated Newtown by a bare point
(84 —83) ; and at Soccer, Balmain Scottish drew
with Granville (one goal each). The draw, how-
ever, didn’t deprive Granville of the _ premiership,
which they have earned by their consistently good
play. * « «
Dr C F Warren, who has thrown a
stone into' the placid bowl of N.S W H»igby Umon
bv proposing that League players should be admitted,
or readmitted, to the Union, is a man of many
parts. A Macquarie-street specialist, he finds time
to be senior vice-president and secretary of the
GP S. Old Boys R.U.F.C. With Combined London
Hospitals he played the famous Maori team of 1888-89,
and later was a member of the Richmond club
Richmond, Blackheath and the Harlequins are the
Big Three of English club football. Next, he joined
the Navy and played for United Services coming to
Australia as surgeon in H.M.S. .Karrakatta, and
settling down in Sydney. In 1914 he joined up,
and in 1915 was C.O. of the Fifth F. A. Brigade in
France. The doc. was timekeeper for the N.S.W.-
Maori games this season, and equipped himself for
the task with a huge dinner-bell.
“The Prophet’’: There is an encouraging precedent
for the doctor’s proposal. Two seasons ago, the M.L.
Rugby Union declared a similar amnesty, and
many star League players took advantage of it. As
a result, the League game in the islands sustained
a blow from which it has not recovered. The posi-
tion in Sydney, as regards the 13-a-side code, is
that the standard has declined and the crowds are
fading away. Played as at present, Union Rugby is
faster than the League brand, and every bit as spectacu-
lar. That could hardly have been said in
previous years, but it is true to-day. What is more,
the body controlling the League game has alienated
public sympathy by its surly attitude to country
clubs, its unconscionable greed for gate-money, and,
recently, by the disqualification of Thompson. There
will be many secessions to the Union if the Warren
motion passes, and for every player that goes over
50 paying patrons will follow.
“Adelaide” : The Chinese Soccer foot-
ballers are likely to have a poor time in Adelaide.
They have asked S.A. League to let them have the
Oval for October 6, but there is no hope. “We
stand for the Australian game of football,” declared
Daly, manager of the team lately in Melbourne;
“never mind about Soccer or any other game.” But
apart from this, the date suggested is that of a
premiership final, after which the Cricket Association
is anxious to get the turf in order for the summer
game. And experience shows that to take any other
ground except the Oval is simply asking for trouble
if there is any counter-attraction going on there.
“Riverina”: Many years ago I wrote a
prophetic pome which contained these lines —
“And at football in the Winter
We will cheer the premiers, drest
In their flying skirts of yellow
With a dragon on the breast.”
The Chinese Soccer players don’t sport yellow skirts,
nor do they look like landing a premiership—in
point of fact, they have yet to win a match. Still
I feel confident I was the first to foretell the present
invasion.
When Ernest Waddy started boxing for
money, Ernest Sheppeard was in the a-b-c class at
school. Which circumstance, together with a stone
advantage in weight, enabled the Lithgow (N.S.W.)
Ern to conquer the Adelaidean in their match. for
the heavyweight championship at Sydney Stadium.
Waddy bogged in from the outset, hoping for
another quick win—in his last three contests he
had finished two of his opponents in the first round,
and the other in the second —but more by luck than
good judgment, the Lithgow man avoided all the
sleep-producers. When the third round came along the
elderly champion had almost beaten himself by
his own exertions. Lithgow began to land heavy swings,
and kept on doing it until the 14th, when Waddy was so
limp that the referee ordered them to the Stadium
office. There Lithgow collected £157 10s. for victory
and Adelaide the same for defeat.
Lithgow now owns two Ai istralian titles. While
Sheppeard was pummelling Waddy the other Lithgow
Ern, Baxter, the right-hander, shaped up against
Spargo at Melbourne Stadium, and was knocked out
in the 11th round of a most exciting fight.
The battle didn’t affect the featherweight champion-
ship, Spargo having been unable to come in at the
weight.
* * * *
“Percy P.”: The hero-worship of pre-war
years has just led to a curious clash in the play-
ground of an Ulawarra school. The headmaster had
two boys sent before him for fighting. One was
Wiliam Squires Robins; the other Leslie Darcy
Jones.
* * * *
“Wink”: There are good judges who de-
clare that Clarence Weber was, in his prime, the
best wrestler at his weight in the world. Clarence’s
first bid for fame occurred in 1904, when he tackled
Buttan Singh in Wirths’ Circus tent, Melbourne.
But the dusky gentleman knew too many rough-
up tricks for 'the aspiring youth and won with a
stranglehold. For a long time afterwards the
only blemish on the otherwise immaculate Clarence
was a chewed ear. In 1906, however, by using
even more desperate tactics, he wrested the title
from the Hindu, and retained it, undefeated, until
he retired in 1913. No other he met here ever
looked like beating him. His bout with the Yank,
William Maynard, in 1913, was typical. With a
body-grip well up under the armpits, a lift, a
heave and a crash he won the first fall immediately.
The second, secured by the favorite foothold and
a half-nelson, took a leisurely eight minutes. Re-
turning to the mat at 41, Weber has settled the
much-advertised Meeske, a man eight years his
junior, in short order.
Adelaide oarsmen are feeling uncomfortable
about the Torrens Lake, on which they have to rely
absolutely unless they make the journey to the Port
River, windy and salt. The heavy rains from May
to July flooded the Torrens and brought down great
deposits of silt. The weir at the bottom end of the
lake has mostly been kept open to let the stuff get
away, but there are great banks which only dredging
can remove.
Hendren, the Middlesex hitter, who was
christened Elias but whom the crowd calls Patsy,
has again tonped the list of English county batsmen,
with a total’ of 2959 runs, averaging 79.97. It is
his fifth conspicuouslv successful season. Second in
the averages in 1919 and first in 1920, his aggregate
during four years has been 9564 runs, averaging
60.91. By scoring 13 centuries during the late
season he equalled the efforts of C. B. Fry (1901)
and Tom Hayw.ard (1906). Likewise, by exceeding
1000 runs and 200 wickets, Maurice Tate, the Sussex
professional. placed himself in a class with
George Hirst (2385 runs and 208 wickets in 1906),
Albert Trott (1175 runs and 239 wickets in 1899,
and 1337 runs and 211 wickets in 1900), and A. Ken-
nedy (1129 runs and 205 wickets in 1922). Tate is
28 ; Hendren 34.
“Leg-bye”: A fine cricketer of the old
school was J. W. Haygarth, who retired to the eternal
pavilion at Boonah (Q.) with the score of 81. Hay-
garth obtained his blue in 1862 as a freshman at
Corpus College, Oxford, and played three times
against Cambridge. He was one of the best wicket-
keepers of his day, as well as a fair batsman and
a useful bowler of lobs. He arrived in Queensland
in 1865 and took to sheep-farming.
THEY WILL NOT MEET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Quite a gloom was thrown over the racing public
at the beginning of the week by the announcement
that Beauford and Gloaming would not meet at
Randwick. The latter, who has failed to stand a pre-
paration, is to be sent back to M.L.”
The sun that yesterday on Randwick shone
So bright seems of a sudden waxed and wan.
At Tatt.’s andi various other glad resorts
Thick clouds of gloom enshroud erst jovial sports.
The bookie sips his fizz, morose and drear,
The virtue’s gone out of the punter’s beer ;
The very dogs are barking in the street
“They will not meet.”
What though they whisk Papyrus o’er the surf
To match the speediest prad on Yankee turf,
Or half the world to brisk attention spring
When Firpo faces Dempsey in the ring,
What are these champs to us beside the twain
Who should have met —and never may again—
To put it to the last decisive test
Which was the best?
Four times they strove, th’ indomitable pair,
And left it fifty-fifty, as it were.
O fate malign! O execrable luck !
We’ll never know which would have cooked the duck.
The world rolls on with just one riddle more
To add to its innumerable store,
Which was the speedier? (Each knew defeat,
Each tasted victory twice.) It has us beat.
They will not meet!

In buying a motor car, consider what the cost
will be when divided over a period of years.
What is the car’s reputation for satisfactory
service after the first year? After the second?
And after the third—and fourth?
These considerations, in the final analysis, are
the true basis of economy in motoring.
And it is this attribute to which Dodge
Brothers Motor Car owes its chief claim upon
the unalterable loyalty of its owners.

The Bulletin
THE INKY WAY.
“Chrome": C. P. Benson is taking on the job
of Art Editor of Melbourne Table-Talk. II is
friends, who call him “dear old Benno,” are expected
to forgive him.
“The Deacon” : For. a felicitously named newspaper
commend me to the Aeroplane, the successor of
the old Western Suburbs Advertiser (Sydney).
The proprietors are J. T. Bird and J. S. Swan.
“Adelaide”: The linotype has played another nasty
trick. Being evidently a perfect gentleman, the citizen
explains (Register 21/8/'23) that it must be his
bad writing in fault ; but that as a fact he had meant
to say in a previous issue that the word of an Eng-
lishman would always be accepted, whereas it had
appeared in print as “the word of a highwayman.”
Will Kennedy, who has been private secretary to
a long line of Vic. Ministers for Works, has thrown
up the job to join Melbourne Herald. Besides “do-
ing” a million deputations or thereabouts, he has
been sec. to the Traffic Commission and several
other inquiry boards; and that training ought to
come in handy in the present fierce scramble for
exclusive bits of news.
“Sturt'’: In Adelaide on a visit is C. F. Stephens,
grandson of one of the founders of the Reuister.
He took all sorts of honors at Adelaide Uni. 30 years
ago, and at Oxford later, but has been settled in
Japan ever since 1004. At first he did Uni. lec-
turing there, but since the war he has been “reviser
of foreign correspondence” to the Nippon Yusen
Steamship Co. of Japan.
“Rounds”: It is true that the Argijs didn’t refer
to the illness of Mollie, the ourang-outang at the
Zoo, in its personal column, but probably the -eason
was that the par. was too long. So it put two
headlines on the item and placed it alongside the
leader. It could not have done more if Bruce had
been dying. In the one column you read, “She is
on invalid diet- —oranges, rice, sow-thistles, and
whisky and milk,” and in the other (the leader),
“Fawning at the seat of authority has non
since the gilded halls of the King's palace have
given place to the market-place, where heads are
now bowed and knees bent.” Fawning! Well, he
it so!
“Per Bacco” : Roy Bridges is not Melbourne Age s
art critic (B. 23/8/’23). The duty of tracking down
geniuses in the art world and reporting the finds
devolves on M. J. McNally, the ex-butter-merchaut.
and water-colorist, who has brought a fresh and
fearless spirit to the job. McNally has good taste
and nice judgment, and manages to slip many' a
pointed comment past the snub-editor. Bridges, who
searches current literature for fine writing, also
reviews the drama with an honesty of decision that
his daily-paper colleagues would do well to emulate.
He confesses, however, that he hasn’t much time
for writing novels now. His new duties eat up most
of his working-day.
“Werp”: Paul Gsell, in “Anatole France
and His Circle,” introduces one “Mr. Brown,
Professor of Philology at the University of
Sydney, ‘in search of the secret of genius.’ ”
This is the apparition that blundered in
on Anatole and his circle, according to Paul:
“He was a stout, robust man, of florid complexion,
with close-shaven lips and chin. The vigor of his
muscles proved that he had assiduously cultivated
golf and polo. He wore gold-rimmed spectacles.
His red hair, brushed to the front, was as stiff as
the bristles of a wild boar. We were struck by his
Anglo-Saxon elegance. Near to, his suit was a
mass of thick threads with all the colors of the rain-
bow ; but at a certain distance he assumed the
greenish and indefinite color of pea-soup. Around
his soft collar, cut low on a bull-like neck, was a
narrow red tie which somewhat paraded a conquer-
ing disposition. Yellow shoes, as long and as broad
as steamboats, completed the get-up of this learned
and solid Australian,.” who “beamed with delight at
being understood,” for he “expressed himself in
French with great difficulty and was, moreover, embar-
rassed in the presence of an illustrious man....
He listened, to be sure, with both ears, but also
with eyes very wide open and especially with gaping
mouth.” Anybody recognise the Professor?
“Santander”: The keen rivalry between Melbourne
Herald and evening Sun was brought to an unex-
pected head the other day through the sudden de-
parture of Angus Murray, a long-term prisoner from
the Geelong Gaol. A day or so after Murray’s exit
the Sun published an alleged letter from the mis-
creant comprehensively damning the Victorian prison
system, and declaring, among other things, that six
solitary confinees had been taken to the lunatic
asylum. Whilst being careful to doubt the authen-
ticity of the letter, the Sun made a splash of the
missive, with the result that the Herald became
scornful of the other’s “innocence” in publishing an
alleged fake, though it forgot to mention that it
had a few months before printed two or three letters,
equally doubtful in origin, which had purported to
come from the celebrated “Squizzy Taylor. Also
in chiding the Sun the Herald made the mistake of
alluding to its contemporary as “our Sydneyside
friends.” This gave the latter a chance for a
riposte in a very tender spot. The Sun remarked
that, instead of being run by Sydneysiders, its staff
was mainly Victorian-born, and that, anyhow, they
were wholiv Australian, whereas the other sheet had
to import people from Whitechapel to tell us that
N. S. Wales was the capital of Adelaide, or words
to the same effect. The Sun is now leading on points,
and it is hard to see that the Fink ’Un can have any
answer to the gibe anent its profound preference for
the imported article in its higher staff appointments.
OUR MEAT-FED BARDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
~ , r ; Thwing, an American professor, author of
the latest book on the Commonwealth, declares that
Australians eat more meat and write more poetry
than any other people in the world.”
A fig for the sack and canary
Down necks ’Lizabethan that flowed
When the lilt of the lyric was faerie
And stately the march of the odel
Tile hard who's Australian refuses
Those aids of the Mermaid’s elite;
He finds when he’s wooing the Muses
More virtue in meat.
Where sunlight and gladness environ
Existence, what lyre-smiter yearns
For the claret that comforted Byron.
The whisky that vitalised Burns,
The Xeres seductive and golden
That Laureates drew with their keep?
Oh, better by far be beholden
To cattle and sheep.
There’s stimulus doubtless in stingo
And pep in the port that they stock —
Appraised by the metrical lingo
Will Waterproof used —at The Cock.
But happier, surely, the nation
Where, careless of vine and of hop,
The poets derive inspiration
From steak and from chop.
Arcadian, song-flooded regions
Are ours, but ,’tis not from the grape
The rhythmical fancies of legions
Of Shelleys and Sapphos take shape.
Their harmonies, vibrant with passion,
'Mid clatter of knife and of fork.
On beef and on mutton they fashion
And, possibly, pork.
Hoe in, multitudinous spinners
Of highbrow and mystical verse—
Hoe into your lunches and dinners
Regardless of what you disburse!
No sirloin too costly a victual
Can be, and no fillet too prime,
If it only produces a little
More nieat in your rhyme.

The Boucicault-Vanbrugh production of
“Mr. Pim Passes By,” at Melbourne King’s,
diverges from the Marie Tempest version in
the relative importance of Olivia and Pim.
In Marie’s view Olivia was the self-
determined centre of events, and she em-
ployed all the devices of an astute stage
tactician in exaggerating the significance of
the lady. On the other hand, Boucicault, cast
as Pim, just as resolutely shifts the balance
of emphasis in favor of the elderly caller,
with the result that Olivia is left compara-
tively in the background, along with her
husband and the other characters. From his
entrance Boucicault holds the floor, and the
memory of his personality abides after he
has absent-mindedly dropped his bomb and
pitter-pattered into the world outside. Dra-
matically, of course, Pim is a striking figure;
but Boucicault enhances his quaintness by
a seething conspiracy of details, which, if
oddly theatrical in themselves, have a mass
effect of devastating whimsicality. Yet it
must be said that the little man with the
gesturing hands, the conspicuously peering
eyes and the bird-like note of ludicrous tim-
idity, affords one the impression that he is
crowding in the experience of a lifetime to
make a terrific demonstration of a limited
opportunity. Frankly, he is inclined to over-
act, to spoil a sincere intention with a flash
of caricature. His make-up, noticeable for
the artificiality of a white wig and a queer-
ish bit of chin-whisker, seems to be in keep-
ing with his conception, but contrasts
strangely with the grey Dundrearys which
hung from the countenance of the tall and
drooping Pim of Ashton Jarry in the Marie
Tempest presentation.
Irene Vanbrugh is always equal to the
responsibilities of Olivia, and her demoralis-
ing douches of feminine logic when her man
is trembling in every moral fibre are de-
livered with all the quiet humor of a dame
MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
“The Big Four” in melody.
who is sharpening into a domestic cynic.
Perhaps her best point is her artful inability
to wholly conceal her mirth at the stiff pro-
bity of her husband. A sort of smouldering
smile serves as a flashlight of her attitude
on the matter, even though she risks scandal-
ising the county and the church. C. M.
Hallard has stodginess and to spare for a
faithful picture of George Marden. In fact,
his views on the awfulness of being branded
as an adulterer have the piercing ring of a
personal conviction. Lena Halliday broaches
the heavy respectability of Lady Marden in
one or two flinty sentences, and Dinah is a
charming exhibition of winsomeness in the
hands of Janet Eccjes. Martin Walker, as
Brian Strange, is a capable partner for
Dinah in the love scenes, but he hasn’t her
moments of radiant youthfulness.
* * * *
A fair measure of success is assured to
the revival of “Ma Mie Rosette” at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s. The romantic comic
opera, cleverly adapted from the French,
is as charming in its maturity as it was
when Nellie Stewart, Wallace Brownlow,
Flo Young, Joseph Tapley, Howard Vernon
and George Lauri filled the principal parts.
The dainty light airs, melodious orchestra-
tion and pretty trimmings have an un-
diminished appeal, and the story breathes
eternal truths of human interest in pic-
turesque fiction.
* * * *
The production is smart enough, though
not profusely generous in volume of chorus,
or highly artistic as regards cloud shapes on
the backcloth of the village scene. The
clouds might be snow-strewn mountains, or
rocky cliffs, suffering from chalky gout.
Rosette, waking or dreaming, is well played
and even better sung by Gladys Moncneff.
Her fault of too-rapid utterance seemed to
leave her very puffed after the second encore
for Packer’s old Australian ballad (which
Nellie Stewart interpolated into the dream
scene), and the tip of her top note was as
hard as iron; but her vocalisation was
mostly tender as well as sweet. It was
only in the midnight hour, when temptation
threatens, that both Rosette and Henri
might have put more thrill into the situation.
Apologies for Claude Flemming’s voice were
hardly necessary, considering the rich feel-
ing he imparted into' his invalided warble.
Though a picturesque monarch, Flemming
was histrionically eclipsed by Reg Roberts,
a valuable Vincent in days of yore, but
never so good as on Saturday. The one
flaw in his performance was his boisterous
merriment on learning that Martha has
hooked the valet. Having more serious
matters on his mind at the time he ought
not to have enjoyed the joke so vigorously.
Lottie Sargent was brighter and more in-
cisive as Martha than was Stigant as Bouil-
lon. Cecil Bradley, as Corisande, lacked
only height and carriage, as Rosette lacked
slimness and grace; but Leslie Holland,
as Colonel Cognac, lacked nothing. As far
as the testy “old warrior” could be pre-
sented as an actual damaged adorer of Cori-
sande, and not a caricature, Leslie Holland
shed new light on the subject.

Melbourne Mermaid Society’s staging of
Galsworthy’s “The Foundations” was better
worth while than anything else done at the
Playhouse of late. It makes no pretence
of a purpose, like some of Shaw’s animated
discussions arranged on similar lines, but
it sets intelligent people thinking. Two
social extremes, represented by Lord and
Lady William Dromondy, M.P., at one end,
and combative plumber Lemmy and his
patient old mother at the other, meet under
wildly fictitious circumstances. When the
humorous talk is over the salvation of
society is no nearer than ever. All that
has been learned is that a supposed bomb
left in his Lordship’s wine-cellar by the
iconoclastic plumber was merely a cistern
ball-float, which seems a rather puerile mis-
understanding to serve as the foundations
of a comedy with 20 characters in it. The
characters had been carefully cast by the
Mermaid management, and in the whole
show not one amateur was sadly misplaced.
Several of them gave a faint air of reality
to their parts. Professionals could have done
little more.

Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood” is
putting ordinary heroism to shame at Mel-
bourne Princess’s, and twice a day until
further notice the drama in black and white
that Hugh Ward describes as “the Film’s
noblest achievement” will revive the age of
chivalry in pictorial form. An orchestra of
20, conducted by Harry Jacobs, accompanies
the crowded incidents on their way. A fine
picture in photography and narrative, with
a robust seamy side to its blessed chivalry.
The _ sweetness of Enid Bennett as Maid
Marian helps make the picture memorable.

“Rockets” is keeping Melbourne Palace
open as usual, whereas the Royal will not
be open again until Saturday (15th), when
“Sally,” from Sydney, gives the new fur-
nishings their baptism of wear and tear. The
same night Allan Wilkie opens an eight
Weeks’ season at the Playhouse. The first
week’s programme will begin with “King
Lear,” and afterwards alternate the pessi-
mistic tragedy with “Twelfth Night.”
* * * «
A mixed show in Melbourne:—
W. D. Knox ventilates his affection for the pano-
ramic landscape in his collection at the Athenaeum.
His largest subject is “On the Upper Murray”-—-
rolling valleys and purple hills which he exploits with
more craft elsewhere. “Toowong Gap” is a much
better performance; but here, as in other canvases
of the kind, the mass treatment of slumbering gum-
forests looks like a “smart” demonstration of brush-
work. The brush play in the foreground of “Ploughed
Fields” also irritates because it is unwarranted,
and the same passion for slickness spoils a tree in
the otherwise agreeable “Farm Buildings.” However,
there is no denying the artistic appeal of “The
Brown Hillside” with its well-handled foreground and
patch of trees curtained against the evening light.
The good atmospheric quality of “The Outer Suburbs”
is a strong point in its favor, and the curling shadows
on the water of “The Green Hooker” are veracious
—surprisingly veracious.
If “Quarantine” owes most of its attrac-
tion to its “bedroom” scene, it has the pull
over previous plays of such frankly French
genesis in being written by a skilful and
witty dramatist (F. Tennyson Jesse) and
“THE CABARET GIRL,” AT SYDNEY
HER MAJESTY’S.

tion so spotted that it looks like Gruyere

presented by a practised and polished actor.
Also a quarantine-station bungalow is a
pleasant change from a hotel suite. Tony
Blunt, an explorer of a type only found in
fiction, arranges to elope with Mrs. Pamela
Josephs, but Dinah Partlett, a romantic and
impressionable damsel, contrives to substi-
tute herself for her aunt without the know-
ledge of the gentleman most intimately
concerned in the adventure. Her ostensible
object, of course, is to save her mature rela-
tive’s reputation, and it only transpires later
that she is herself desperately in love with
the celebrity whom she was altruistically
undertaking to save from breaking Com-
mandment No. 7. On the steamer Dinah can
maintain her laudable presence of being
somebody she wasn’t by convenient indis-
position ; but when the whole party are
quarantined, and the explorer and his un-
suspected affinity are consigned to a bunga-
low “built for two,” things begin to move
with rapidity and continue to progress with
a liberal amount of riotous humor and
piquant thrill to a highly proper ending.
The audience at the Sydney Royal gave the
play an enthusiastic reception, and Lawrence
Grossmith a warm welcome back to Sydney.
* * * *
Grossmith shows himself just as much at
home in his new role as he did in any of the
others he has offered Australia ; in whatever he
plays he gives the impression of easy, effort-
less competence. As Dinah, Miss Dorothy
Seacombe discloses a winsome personality
and an entrancing mixture of innocence and
candor. Miss Phyllis Ruthven gave a clever
representation of the lady who should have
been eloped with, while Diana Wilson as
Lola de la Corte is an audaciously fascinat-
ing adventuress. As Pinsent, the highly-
respectable maidservant who becomes in-
volved in the bungalow complications, Mabel
Gower scores a hit. There are some
thoroughly humorous and finely-portrayed
types among the minor characters—the Mr.
Burroughs of Edmund Duggan, the Cyrus P.
Honks of E. P. Bush, the Mrs. Burroughs of
Mildred Cottell, and the Miss Larpent
of Adelaide Gunn. The dialogue is bright
throughout, and the fun runs a banker in the
closing scenes.
“Smilin’ Through,” at Sydney Criterion,
is of no great intrinsic importance, but it
enables Gertrude Elliott to give further evi-
dence of versatility. In “Woman to Woman”
the elegant lady was a French dancer, with
a history of impropriety and sacrifice; in
“Enter Madame” a Latin prima donna, by
turns tempestuous and tender. In the new
piece she is (1) a bride) of the crinoline
era, destroyed on the bridal date by a rejected
applicant for her hand. (2) an Irish col-
leen, own sister to Paddy-the-next-best-thing
and Peg-o’-my-heart, and (3) the bride again,
revisiting the glimpses of the moon to console
her lover, now grown old and crabbed, and
by her influence to reconcile him to the
marrias-e of his niece with the murderer’s
son. The play should appeal to the large
section of Suburbia that likes its sentiment
sloppy, and nowise objects to spooks. More-
over, some very good acting has to be placed
to the credit of Miss Elliott, William Mollison,
Aubrey Mather, Lilias Waldegrave, Anne
McEwen and Cronin Wilson. The last-
named, however, has been better suited in
other productions.
* * * *
“The Beggar’s Opera,” which gripped Lon-
don 40 years before Captain Cook set out
to find Australia, is still drawing crowded
audiences to Sydney Palace. Nobody can
see Howett Worster without understanding
the thrill of sympathy that ran through 18th-
century England whenever a gallant like
Macheath dangled from Tyburn Tree or lay
on the highway with a bullet through his
midriff and a bunch of lace at his throat.
sic s’.: s'.: *
At Sydney Opera House “The Faithful
Heart” continues to beat to generous emo-
tions in the breast of debonair G. H. Mul-
caster. It’s a bit of good, wholesome drama,
with some skilfully-presented scenes and
characters.
* * *
“The Cabaret Girl” is shaking off all ap-
pearance of artificiality and going with a
madder, gladder swing every night at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney. Madge Elliott and
Alfred Frith are just the pair to exorcise
all day-infesting cares; the wit and humor
and sparkle in the piece are undeniable.

Herschel Henlere gave an extra turn to
the grip he has on Sydney Tivoli’s paying
customers and others when he sang “Aussie
Land” on Saturday. So intriguing is the
tune that the homing audience disturbed the
peace of many suburbs that night. The
“Come on Red” trio still make things brisx
with piano, banjo aijd saxophone; the Reeve
Girls and Leslie are invigorating, and so are
the restless Eileen and Marjorie.

Allan Wilkie’s Sydney season closed at the
Conservatorium on Saturday night, when
“The Merchant of Venice” put up the shut-
ters. The local Shakspeare Society there-
upon presented the chief with a bust of
the Bard, which looks as though it might
cost its owner a bit in “excess” if he takes
it on tour with him. The Hunter-Watts
lady, his wife, came in for a walking-cane,
and Lorna Forbes got off with a beaded bag,
loud applause and a mountain of flowers.

The most striking thing about Adelaide
pictures is that even the daily papers have
criticised Chaplin’s “Pay Day,” showing at
both York and West’s, instead of just turn-
ing on the usual superlatives. Wondergraph
has “Java Head” ; the book is better than
the film. Beaumbht Smith’s “Townies and
Hayseeds” is at the York for Show Week.

“0.K.”: Hugh Ward favors a system of
picking understudies from the chorus in his
musical shows, in preference to selecting
lesser principals to understudy the larger
ones. During frequent absences through
sickness of May Beatty, her job has fallen
to Nancy McNaughton, and when Ena Dale
lately was down with measles Mary Gan-
non popped up pleasingly in her place as
chief “Tangerine” singing-girl. Unfortu-
nately for the understudies of Mamie Wat-
son and Mark Daly, the tall leading lady
and the little comedian put up something
like records by appearing for nearly 40 con-
secutive weeks without missing a perfor-
mance. What an example for some of those
uncertain human quantities who start to be
absent from the company almost as soon
as they are present!
“Fax”: “Robin Hood,” screened by Hugh
Ward at Melbourne Princess’s, calls to mind
a romantic opera of that name, in which
Ward played one of his best comedy parts
for the J.C.W. firm of old. More than 20
years ago Reg de Koven’s charmingly melo-
THE SILVER LINING.
“She came down last night to play for us,
hut lost her music in The storm.”
“Ah, well, it’s an ill wind that blows no
good.”
dious opera was staged in Australia, an
imported tenor named Lyding taking the
name-part. Carrie Moore was Maid Marian,
while Florence Young wore tights and tunic
as Allan-a-Dale. George Lauri and Hugh
Ward were respectively Sheriff of Notting-
ham and Sir Guy of Gisborne, the latter
being a silly-ass knight of the period, a sort
of Andrew Aguecheek dominated by Sheriff
Lauri, who was something of a Toby Belch.
Hugh Ward’s performance was memorable
for a facial make-up that gave a particular
character of inanity to the impersonation.
His upper lip was so extravagantly enlarged
that it lent a muffled pomposity to his speech,
and made him an unforgettable Guy.
“Orb”: Allan Wilkie is the hardest his-
trionic grafter I ever met. Consider what
he went through for his last week at Sydney
Conservatorium: Monday, “King Lear”;
Tuesday, "Henry V.”; Wednesday, "Ham-
let” ; Thursday, “Twelfth Night” (Malvo-
lio) ; Friday, “Lear” ; and Saturday, “The
Merchant.” This little list must have in-
curred a tremendous physical strain, and the
mere effort of memory is remarkable. And
Wilkie can only take breath in one in-
terval of each performance. A glimpse at
the dungeon-like dressing-room beneath the
Con. stage—-there was only one room for the
men—revealed his mummers in a dreamy,
pre-occupied state, with none of the usual
touch-and-go jocularity of the dressing-room.
But Wilkie was always cheerful, and found
time to crack jokes with a stream of visitors
as he mopped the melted greasepaint from
his brow. He’s a trier all right.
Thus The Bulletin’s Melbourne critic:
Talking last week of Letty Lind, we all forgot to
mention that she and every other member of the
first Gaiety Co. that visited Australia have lived for
35 years in Phil May’s page of sketches, drawn for
The Bulletin what time Phil was staying a year in
Melbourne. As a catcher of likenesses the caricaturist
was then at his top. He pointed to that old Gaiety
page as being the best thing he had done in Aus-
tralia. As reproduced (rather badly) in The Bulle-
tin it was a staggering reminder of the original
Gaiety girls and boys; and the manner of Letty
Lind’s dancing, as compared with Sylvia Gray’s, was
wonderfully suggested. Of the facial likenesses the
happiest were those of Fred Storey, George Musgrove
and stage-manager Walter Raynham. In that year,
1888, the skill of Phil May’s drawing, when he was
in love with his subject, was miraculous. His eye
and hand would catch a figure in movement as surely
as they seized it in pose and repose.
On an impending revival:—
A play in the Vanbrugh-Boucicault repertoire that
has some really great moments is “The Notorious
Mrs. Ebbsmitli.” The leading parts of Mad Ann
and the cynical Duke should fit the two principals
like gloves. Indeed, the part of the Duke was
about Boucicault’s best when he was 25 years
younger, and he has been growing nearer to the
Duke’s age ever since. But “Mrs. Ebbsmitli - ’ is
a fine play up to a point only. Pinero wrote down
to the Nonconformist conscience when he introduced
Mrs. Ebbsmith’s strange goings on with a Bible,
Seated alone with the Book, this freethought lecturess
pitches it on the fire, and then, as though frightened
of offending good churchgoers among the audience,
retrieves it from the flames and hugs it to her
bosom before the curtain is quite down. The world
didn’t need Bernard Shaw to tell it, as he did, that
if the Mrs. Ebbsmith of Pinero’s creation had
thrown a Bible on the fire she would have left it
there to burn. The incident is entirely false to
Mrs. E.’s spirited discussion with the naughty old
Duke, though it pretends to be consistent with the
lady’s friendship for a parson’s sister, who tries
to convert her from the ways into which advanced
thinking has led her. It is only in plays and books
written to impress the stodgy that such women as
Mad Ann are converted by parsons’ sisters. In real
life the brainy Anns either convert the parsons’
sisters, sub vosa , or else make their narrow little
minds so angry that they sniff at the sinner and leave
her to suffer brimstone in the hereafter.
“Jacky Roo” : The Firm made a slip when
it thrust golf clubs into the hands of the
male chorus in “The Cabaret Girl.’’ The
singing gents grasp their sticks as if they
wet-e meat-axes. Their preliminary swings
would break the heart of a Manly or Rose
Bay pro. It is in matters like this—small
individually, but important in the mass —
that I find myself comparing the local pro-
duction unfavorably wuth the London show.
Certainly Alfred Frith and MacTge Elliott
are not to blame.
“S.T.S.” : “0.K.” must have been unlucky
to find Cyril Mackay “loud and savage” (B.
19/7/’23). FTom his start as the amiable
scapegrace in “The Virginian,” who begged
his fellow horse-thief to “take your medicine
graceful” when they both had to be hanged,
right up to his last work with the Repertory
Theatre in Adelaide, Mackay always seemed
to me to have an easy style which erred, if
at all, the other way—on the side of over-
smoothness. By the way, most of Cyril’s
last year of life was spent in Adelaide, Paris
Nesbit having found him a billet as law clerk.
“Namoi”: “Abbot Park” (B. 23/8/’23)
inquires whether anyone remembers Nellie
Stewart in the “Twinkle Little Star” panto,
at Melb. Royal in 1873. I remember the
show well, but Nellie Stewart, I think, was
a schoolgirl then ; Docy Stewart was Twinkle,
and Maggie Stewart also took part, not
forgetting J. R. Greville and Harry Leston.
Clara Thompson (Mrs. H. Bracy) was
principal boy. Those were the days (or
nights) of “The Princess of Trebizonde” —
an extravaganza in which 'H. R. Harwood
took a leading part—of “La Belle Helene”
and “La Perichole,” with the Bracys as prin-
cipals. It was at the Melb. Royal in 1874
that J. C. Williamson and Maggie Moore
opened in “Struck Oil.” Maggie is still on
active service, and, by the way, isn’t some-
thing going to be done about that jubilee?
“T.P.”: So Jennie Lee (B. 30/8/’23) is
receiving £lOO p.a. from an actors’ fund. Her
"Jo,” at Melb. Royal in the early ’eighties,
was a harvest for the street Arabs of the
period. How the artful kids used to line up
outside the theatre, when the audience was
melting into the night after the death scene!
J recall one nipper who had Jennie’s church-
yard cough to a nicety, and another who could
gasp “ ’E wos werry good to me, ’e wos,” in
perfect imitation of the star —a slender
young woman then, but a too well-nourished
dame when she revisited Melbourne in after
years. Jennie’s husband, J. P. Burnett, was
the detective in this production. He was
playwright as well as actor, but his pieces
are forgotten.
“E.T.”: “Anna Christie,” by Eugene
O’Neill, did not set the Thames on fire when
submitted to Londoners recently, although
O’Neill is the best-boomed dramatist on
earth. After its very short run at the Strand
apologists pointed to the slump in - things
theatrical in London, and the usual effects
of a hot summer on business. But that was
mostly guff, for there are at least two pieces
THERAPEUTICS.
“She died very suddenly, didn't she?”
“Very.”
“Doctor or faith ewe?”
in the West End going so strongly that they
look as though they might equal the “Chu-
Chin-Chow” record. “Bluebeard’s Eighth
Wife,” with Madge Titheradge in the lead,
has been drawing crowds to the Queen’s for
two or three months over a year, and “Tons
of Money” was produced earlier still at the
Shaftesbury and is now at the Aldwych.
Both are shortly to lie hurled at Australian
audiences.
“Lud”: William Archer’s play, "The
Green Goddess,” which has been sailing
along triumphantly in the U.S.A. since its
original production there two years ago, is
to be staged here, with Lawrence Grossmith
in the lead. The thing was put on in Lon-
don last month, George Arliss returning to
his native land to play the part he “cre-
ated” in New York. Archer, the son of an
old-time Queensland A.-G., has made so much
money out of his piece that he is reported to
have given up dramatic criticism, though, for
that matter, he was always financially and
otherwise independent.
“Second Murderer”: The “natural” school
of acting has become popular (with the
mummers) ; in fact, a good deal of the play
is inaudible beyond the front stalls. When
we did “The Strangles of Paris,” at New-
castle (N.S.W.), our leading lady was so
confidential that very few of our patrons
knew what she was talking about. After one
long speech delivered in a whisper, a miner in
the gallery demanded plaintively“ Hey,
missus, ain’t we supposed to ’ear this? You
ain’t on the pitchers!”
“Mancam”: Speaking of actors reproving
their audiences from the stage, it is recorded
in “Jimmy Glover, His Book,” that when
“Rank and Riches,” a play by Wilkie Col-
lins, “was done at London Adelphi, G. W.
Anson came on and lectured the audience as
to their treatment of this great author.”
Glover adds that “it took us all some time
to quiet down the house.” I heard Anson at
the T.R., Sydney—“ The Red Lamp” was the
play—step out of his character to advise a
bibulous interjector that “the audience didn’t
come here to listen to you,” but that time
his reproof won a round of applause.
From a corner in Cockaigne:—
Florence Austral has collected another parcel of
compliments from the critics for her work in
“Tristan and Isolde,” at Covent Garden. “Fine
singing,” said the Times man. shouted the
Daily Telegraph, which also referred to “the rich-
ness and warmth.... the sensitive and appealing
quality” of the Melbourne girl’s voice.
The luckiest of recent combinations are the Co-
optimists, who have just celebrated the close of their
second year of box-office success. Consisting of six
men and four girls, and doing just Pierrot stuff, they
started with a capital of £9OO, and have taken
£250,000 gross during the two years. It is an
experiment that might be tried in Australia. There
is no really first-class performer among the Co-opti-
mists, but they have a business-manager with a genius
for getting publicity.
“The unprecedented heat wave” was the excuse for
the failure of “Reckless Reggie,” Marie Lohr’s latest
venture. But, heat wave or no heat wave, it never
had a hope. A farce of the knockabout order, it
was the flattest of flat stuff. Another show that
crashed early was a dramatised version of Disraeli’s
“Tancred,” perpetrated by the wife of r serva-
tive politician. It was almost unanirr Died
by the critics.
“S ila s” : Wee
Geo rgie Wood,
although he
trades so much on
his diminutive
stature apd his ap-
parent (youthful-
ness, is h touchy
pigmy, add off the
stage resfents the
familiarity often
extended to him on
t h e Supposition
that he is a small
boy. One day dur-
ing -his first Mel-
bourne season lie
was riding down
Bourke-street in a
cram, he having a
Lauder-like appre
ciation of cheap
transit. The tram
was packed when
a woman got in
and stood, strap-
hanging, obviously
expecting that
there was a little
gentleman aboard.
The man sitting
next to Wood
spoke upjn the in-
terests of , the sex.
“Here, youngster,”
he said, “give your
seat to the lady,
and you can sit on
my knee.” “If I
did,” snapped Wee
Georgie, “y o u
would have more
on your knee than
you ever had in
your head.” The man, a large, lumpy fellow,
looked at Georgie a moment; then he
wailed in mock consternation: “My God, the
fellow might have struck me!”
“Santander”: At a big Melbourne show
the other night the male star lost
control of his false teeth. The plate
hurried out after an impassioned speech,
but the owner didn’t bat an eyelash.
Unperturbed, he picked up his embarrassing
property, turned his back for a moment to
restore it to the old address, and resumed his
advice to the stricken heroine. An American
critic recalls another great example of sang
froid. During a performance of Haupt-
mann’s “Hannele” in New York, the girl
who was playing the name-character parted
company with her bifurcated undergarments.
They fluttered down her legs and collapsed
at her feet; but she stolidly pulled them up
and, while fastening them securely, gravely
continued her speech.
Jack McLaren meets a celebrity :
One dirty, dismal London night I was with a girl
in the gallery of the Court Theatre listening to a
Galsworthy play. During one of the acts the girl
pointed through the gloom to a solitary figure half-
way along the empty bench, and whispered her awe-
stricken belief that it was George Bernard Shaw.
Shaw was notorious for doing queer things, she said,
such as seeing a play from the gallery. I was in-
clined to disbelieve'her—till the lights went up. We
had been to Madame Tussaud’s that afternoon and
had taken particular notice of the effigy of Shaw,
which, with those of Dickens and Thackeray, sits at
a table near the entrance of the main hall. Except
that the beard of the wax person was brown while
that of the living man was grey, the two were iden-
tical, even to the clothes. It was Shaw. We felt a
desire to speak with him, but didn’t know how to
manage it without danger of a rebuff. Hoping
against hope, at the end of the play we followed him
down the stairs and across the road to the ’bus-stop
—it was apparently another of the Great Man’s queer
habits to ride in a ’bus rather than the Rolls Royce
he could easily afford. Then, to our delight, a man
we knew accosted him as an old friend. We barged
in and were introduced. Then we stood by, waited
for incisive criticism of the play and words of great
wisdom generally, and heard a beautifully cultured
and delightfully Irish voice—revile the weather.
THE THROBBING HEART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Remember, above all things, that erring and even
degraded criminals are men with throbbing hearts.”
Whenever you would be pathetic,
When words you must weave for the mart,
Don’t worry if you are bathetic,
But drag in the throb of a heart.
As good .as a grey-haired old mother
fVhose griefs cause the toughest to sob
In the utter bad egg: —he’s a brother —
Whose heart you can work for a throb.
They know it full well in the movies;
Their ads. make a stirring appeal:
“The villain’s repentance will prove he’s
A man with a Heart that can Feel!
The Love of a AVoman suffices
To work a great change in his heart.
Come witness, at popular prices,
This triumph of silver-screen art!”
It may be his father he bludgeoned,
His mother he callously robbed,
i His wife he incessantly trudgeoned.
Forget it! —his manly heart throbbed!
Fair faces, which handkerchiefs smother,
Their tribute will yield to your art
If you give them a backsliding brother
With a loud-sounding throb to his heart.

Combining flexibility and fleetness, power efficiency with dependability the new
CASE engine achieves what has hitherto been deemed impossible. Because of the
high standard of quality and workmanship 55 horsepower is economically delivered,
smoothly and without effort. Sturdy crankshaft bearings and good balance ensure
the elimination of critical speed vibration.
On all roads and grades smooth yet positive application of power is easily effected with the CASE-
built Multiple Dry Disc Clutch. This clutch is at least thirty per cent, oversize compared with
the average unit used in cars of equal power and weight. Gears may be shifted noiselessly and
the car put in motion without disturbing jerks. The large bearing surfaces of the eight gear type
plates, separated by heavy non-burn faces, ensure noiseless operation. The chassis of the
CASE Model Xis replete with many improved features. The sturdy frame completely protects
the body and power units from deflection and is calculated to give one hundred thousand miles
of severe service without showing signs of weakness.

THE NEW BEALE ‘7W£~Ttf<R<E‘E
PLAYER PIANO
fpwo indisputable points of Superiority
THERE are many points of superiority
possessed by this New Beale "Five-Three”
Player-Model, but two of very great import-
ance stand out with special emphasis.
First, it is probably the only player-piano in
the world to receive the endorsement of a com-
mittee of Eminent Musical Authorities. After
we had refined the "Five-Three” to the point
where each expert in our Technical Division
was thoroughly satisfied, we decided on the
unique step of getting the opinion of acknow-
ledged musical critics. This committee was
composed of Mr. E. Bennett North (celebra-
ted English pianist) ; Mr. Frank Hutchens
(eminent solo-pianist and composer) ; Mr.
Henry Penn (brilliant English solo-pianist) ;
and Mr. Henri Staell (renowned solo violinist).
The final judgment of this committee was
flatteringly unanimous concerning the superb
quality of the " Five-Three” throughout.
Secondly, notwithstanding the exceptional quality of
the instrument, there is the advantage of the price
being within the reach of the most modest income.
By standardising several formerly costly methods of
manufacture it has been possible to place the price at
£l9B for an instrument finished with genuine mahog-
any, or at £193 for genuine English quartered oak.
Judged from any standard—that of construction,
utility or aesthetic —-this new player-model is a dis-
tinguished production. As an instrument to be used
either by the manually proficient or by the untrain-
ed musician—its satisfactory performance is assured.
Sold on an extended-payment plan over any period
up to three years. Full descriptive literature will be
posted free to those who cannot call and hear the
instrument demonstrated at the address below.

nite charm.
The Williams’ box has the hinged
cover. Easy open —easy close. You
won’t spill the powder nor let the
perfume evaporate if you use a box of
Williams’.

“T.V.T.’s” confidence man :
“Lopper” Evans was broke and hungry ; the townt
ship cold sand inhospitable. A baker’s cart stood ii
a slide street. Lopper was in the act of helping
himself to a loaf when Doughie came out of the
nearest gate with his basket. Most men would hav4
fled, either with or without the bread, but Loppej-
was not so easily rattled; he not only kept hip
ground, but coolly selected another loaf, and stood
balancing them, one in each hand, as the baker
approached. “’Ere, you have ago at this!” hi
said. “A go at wot? Wot th’ are you doin’?’!'
was the harsh response. “I got this loaf fronli
that cow down th’ street,” said Lopper, “and j
reckoned it was under weight, so I was just testin’
it with one of yours. But ’ere—’ave a go an’ see
wot you think of it,” and he thrust the two loaves
into the other’s hands. The latter balanced the
loaves carefully. “You’ve got yer 4lb. there all-
right. lad,”’ he said, tossing one into the cart, and
handing the other to Lopper. “Aw, well, p’raps yer
right,” said Lopper, as he strode off with his spoil,
“but th’ flamin’ thing looked small.” \

Dear Sirs, —
Your letter of the 25th ult. is to hand.
The Hartford Shock Absorbers arrived in good
condition, and I have had them fitted to my
Hudson Speedster.
They have made a wonderful difference to the
car, and I will see that any car which I purchase
in future is fitted with this device.
They have eliminated wheel spin and dithering
on rough roads at high speed, and the car will now
corner beautifully at 40 to 44 miles an hour.
Yesterday I tried out the car with only myself
in it, and at 65 miles an hour it was glued to thel
road and was easily driven with only one hand on
the steering wheel.
The up-and-down motion usually experienced on
wavy asphalt roads was entirely absent.
To sum up, the result of fitting Hartfords has to
be experienced to be believed, and in my opinion
they are well worth three times the price asked
for a set.
I have to compliment your firm for the very
clear directions sent in respect to the fitting of the
Hartfords.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) MICHAEL McGARRY.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Uramao”: Dunedin, less mercurial than
her sister cities of Maoriland, when she takes
in hand anything likely to spread abroad
the guid conceit she has o’ hersel* is no’
chary about the bawbees. A few months
ago she decided to start amassing £lOO,OOO
for the purpose of holding an international
exhibition in 1925, and up to the present
her citizens have forked up over £60,000.
* * * *
“Aawi”: A paper house, made in Eng-
land, was sent some 35 years ago to Mil-
dura. It was fitted with verandahs, had a
pretty front-gable, and was no hotter than
the ordinary w.b. in the summer. But it
didn’t answer: the partitions between the
six rooms weren’t sound-proof, and the
whole structure would quiver like a sensi-
tive horse at the tread of any ordinary foot.
“Lou”: Cattle-duffing on a large scale is
not yet a dead industry in the Far North.
Recently five men were convicted and got
terms ranging from 5 to 19 months. One
gaiig lifted a mob of over 300 branded cattle
from Cresswell Downs (Qloncurry way),
drove them over on the Gulf side of the
Barkly Tablelands, and camped them in a
gorge, where the Anthony Lagoon police
located them. Another smaller mob was
tracked by the police for 60 miles and re-
covered.
“Borom”: Is there any grosser and viler
scandal being perpetrated in Australia than
the employment of young girls and lads in
the manufacture of mechanical contracep-
tives? A Commonwealth enactment forbids
absolutely the importation of these devices,
but in Sydney and Melbourne there are at
least half-a-dozen factories where they may
be made with impunity, and are being made
to be retailed from almost every chemist’s
shop, boys and girls of ages ranging from
16 to 20 being engaged in the work.
* * * *
“Lightning J.”: Jim Malone, the up-to-
the-minute young chief manager of tele-
graphs, has put the wind up most of the
employees of the telegraph staff by his
avowed intention of installing machine-tele-
graphy wherever possible, necessitating the
employment of unskilled and cheaper labor.
As a partial compensation it is announced
that he is going to give “wired wireless” a
thorough test. With this it should be pos-
sible to work as many as 20 “circuits” simul-
taneously on the one wire. If this proves
as good as it sounds, the skilled lightning-
jerker will again com e into his own, and
the machines will be scrapped.
* * * *
“Parama”: Feeding New Guinea planta-
tion-hands is a pretty big job. The provi-
sions are mostly bought from the native
hunters and paid for in the “coin” of the
bush —trade tobacco, worth somewhere about
4d. a stick. The following are recognised
prices, and are paid almost every day: 1
cassowary (about 801 b.), 20 sticks;" 1
wild pig (up to 1301 b.), 20 sticks; 1 10-ft.
shark, 10 sticks; 1 Bft. alligator, 15 sticks :
1 river-turtle (average 401 b.), 7 sticks; rolls
of native sago, “dau,” averaging 401 b. each,
5 sticks per roll. A wallaby costs 10 sticks,
and one stick is a fair price for a large
snake, goanna, scrub-turkey or a string of
catfish weighing 201 b. Cocoanuts are sold
15 for one stick, those not used for kaikai
going towards filling the copra-sheds. The
plantation has its own store, carrying the
usual lines, including sugar, tinned goods,
kerosene, matches and hardware. But the
natives prefer their native foods, as a gen-
eral thing—there are exceptions—and yams,
sweet potatoes, bananas, etc., are all grown
and bought to help out with the tucker-bill.
* * * *
“Motutau” : “Tauwarra” (B. 28/6/’23)
notwithstanding, there’s no reason why any
Austral-Papuan married man who draws
£7 a week should get into debt. One can
rub along to-day on £2O a month, and some
do it for less. Of course, this doesn’t permit
ot luxury. One can’t keep a houseful of
native servants, play poker for two-bob rises,
and so on. But upon the income “Tau-
warra refers to (£2B a month) life for a
married couple may be maintained without
undue anxiety, and a trifle put away for a
rainy day. Our tin houses, unsuited though
they undoubtedly are for a hot climate, are
no worse than those of many a Queensland
community of longer standing than our own
and can be rented for from 70s. to £6 a month’
Those men with whom I have discussed the
question will not agree for a moment with
Tauwarra” that our general costs are 100
per cent, above those of Sydney. It’s true
that one’s pay doesn’t run to many first-
class steamer passages to Australia; but,
then, I very much question whether the aver-
age Australian holding a small job can stand
himself a 2000-mjle sea trip more than once
or twice in a lifetime. “Tauwarra” com-
plains that our standard of living is immea-
surably lower than that of Sydney. Well,
such as it is, we Europeans have set it, and’
on the whole it suits us very well.

The perfect balance and particular ad-

"Sucre”: At Mareeba (N.Q.) this August
there were five consecutive “white” frosts
with ice-scum a quarter of an inch thick on
the drinking water. This is only three
hours’ journey from Cairns, the “capital” of
tropical Queensland, by the slowest train
in Australia.
Posterity will be able to find the spot
where the discoverer of Tasmania landed.
The Royal Society of the Speck has collected
subscriptions to finance the erection of a
memorial where Tasman stuck his Dutch
flag in 1642, and the Hobart Marine Board
has been asked to lend a steamer for a week
to do the job.
“Spotlight” : The only person I ever heard
of in Australia who knew Napoleon Bona-
parte during his exile at St. Helena
was an old negress, Isadore, who spent
a considerable part of her life as
nurse in the employment of the late
William Barker, of Tamrookum station, on
the Bogan River (Q.). As a child Isadore
was offered and took plenty of opportunities
of observing the Man of Destiny at close
quarters.
“Fitz Henry”: The N.S.YV. Parliament
boasts four Fitzes —the most it has ever
had. They are R. G. D. Fitzgerald, M.8.C.,
who was member for the Upper Hunter and
Robertson, and Minister for Justice in the
See Cabinet ; J. C. B. Fitzpatrick, Minister
for Mines and Bocal Government; J. J.
Fitzgerald, Babor member for Oxley; and
W. R. Fitzsimmons, Macquarie-street dentist
and Nationalist member for Cumberland. In
all eight Fitzes have broken into State
politics, the most notable of them being J. D.
Fitzgerald, who arrived from West Sydney
as one of the first Babor squad in 1891, held
several important Ministerial posts, and died
m July of last year.
“Deco” : Instead of sending politicians to
Britain on borrowing expeditions, why not
send a tramway-manager to Glasgow to
learn his business.' 1 (The Chicago tramways
have already done it.) In the Empire’s
second city the trams are run by the Cor-
poration, and have cleared as large a profit
as £50,000 per annum. Yet not only is the
service unequalled in efficiency, but the fares'
are remarkably low. For the whole of July
—the holiday month —school children were
carried by any tram, at all times of the day,
to whichever terminus they wished, for three-
halfpence return, and from Glasgow to Bal-
loch (Boch Bomond) the distance is about
35 miles.
“Xenon”: “Caveman” (B. 23/8/’23) is
wrong in his conjecture that the “ages-lost
royal purple of Tyr e and Rome” came from
the banana- or any other plant. It was
obtained from a mollusc, akin to the snail,
found in abundance along the Mediterranean
shores. In the excavations at Pompeii, near
the old dyeworks, large quantities of shell
were found. P'ossibly the banana might be
worth exploiting for colors, but I doubt if
it would give results comparable with coal-
tar. The study of seaweed should open a
more profitable commercial field. Besides
gelatine and iodine, a variety of leather
might be produced from this remarkable sub-
stance. Before the discovery of the Chili
saltpetre-deposits, the world’s supply of
iodine came from seaweed.
“A.R.A.”: Depositing some unearned in-
crement at a N.S.W. Government Savings
Bank I found myself jostling another aspir-
ing Carnegie, who was receiving amorous
glances from a detached flapper. The teller’s
clerk withdrew the depositor’s card from its
case, entered the amount, extended the bal-
ance, and handed back the pass-book to its
owner. With a final smile towards his lady
friend the depositor departed, and my waning
interest was revived by a signal from the
flapper to the teller’s clerk requesting sight
of the card. She got it, and after a swift
glance at the figures resumed her seat with
a countenance of seraphic contentment. My
name was called just then, and as I was
checking the entry in the pass-book my eye
caught this gratifying announcement: “The
strictest secrecy is observed in respect of
depositors’ accounts.”
“0.K.”: The Melbourne J.P. has deter-
mined to protect the public from the dis-
honesty of railway employees. The other
day the Richmond beaks had to deal with a
clerk from a parcels office who had stolen a
quantity of cloth. What did the Bench do
with the culprit? It remarked that the pil-
fering of goods confided to the Department’s
care was far too common—far too common.
It must be put down. Examples must be
made. This sort of offence was “altogether
too rampant.” Therefore, in order to wipe
out that sort of thing, etc., the Bench
fined accused £lO, in default three months.
"Only for his previous good character”
accused would have been denied the option
of a fine. The good-character apology offered
by Benches is rarely impressive, In this
case, for instance, the Department had been
complaining for three years of thefts from its
parcels office. This accused’s theft doesn’t
prove that he was the thief all along ; but, at
any rate, the police haven’t produced any
other. J
“Moresby”: “Tauwarra” (B. 28/6/’23)
denies the exploitation of Papuans by Euro-
peans, but in this I refuse to take him seri-
ously. _ How about this for a case of ex-
ploitation? Only a few weeks ago a gang
of paid-off laborers were herded like tame 1
sheep into a store and looted of pretty
well every bean they had except the tax-
money which the Government had already
prised out of them. In return, articles of
trade, previously readied-up, were thrust
upon them higgledy-piggledy. Were they
allowed any choice in the selection of these
articles? Did they want ’em? During the
subsequent week, and prior to being shipped
home, the poor beggars were trying to sell
or barter some of the useless gear about
the town. You can’t, of course, play tricks
like this on the wily gentleman from Hanua-
bada, who has become wise to all sorts of
white-man sharp practice; but it’s the
easiest thing to do it on simple souls from
the Delta. Western Rivers, Mountain Dis-
tricts, and all such remote places. And yet
some of us wonder why the white man iii
Papua is losing prestige!

Spring Brings with it
Skin Troubles, Pimples,
Boils and other Skin
Eruptions.
Why Worry?
Rexona is the Rapid Healer which
brings Skin Health and Beauty.
We all look forward to the Spring, and often forget how
the change of season affects our health and naturally our skin,
causing pimples, sores, rashes, blotches, eczema and even boils
and ulcers to break out.
These skin eruptions are dangerous if neglected, and
might become chronic—you must give them careful attention.
There is no better treatment than to apply Rexona, the Rapid
Healer. This is an antiseptic ointment containing just the right
cooling, soothing and healing properties that are needed to
rid your skin of all impurities and give you a fair start for the
Summer. Rexona soothes pain, builds new, fresh tissues, and
renews and heals the skin. The triangular pot of Rexona, with
its healing, soft green ointment, should be kept handy on the
dressing-table so that every member of the family can have
access to its wonderful healing powers.
Spring Time is
Rexona Time.

Rain.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rain is falling, falling. All day long
I The rain has fallen, and its whispeied
song
Sighs through the house. Upon the window-
pane
Incessantly and softly falls the rain.
The mist of it has blotted out the hills;
Its ceaseless, silken, sibilant murmur nils
The air and echoes from the soaking ground.
The night is silent saving for the sound
Of silver-footed rain. All else is stilled
And mute. Since dawn th’ insistent song
has filled .
The house, pervasive. Every sense is numb,
And every living thing is voiceless, dumb.
These murmurous cadences alone we hear;
This hushed rain-music fills the listening ear.
Yet in my happy heart I hold
Glad memories of blue and gold.
No grey rain falling can destroy
My thoughts of sun-kissed Collaroy,
Of sparkling seas and yellow sand,
Of azure skies, and gay, green land,
Of hills and trees and scented air,
The sight of all things fresh and fair.
These memories awake a song
Within my heart, though dark and long
The winter-time may be, and grey,
A song to sing until the day,
The golden day of gladness, when
The summer sun will shine again.
VICTORIA.
G. ETHEL MARTYR.
His Bush Heart.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A SHAKY buekboard rattled up to
Lankey’s hut, and from it alighted
Old Bob Conyers, of Willeroo. He
shuffled towards the end of the building,
where Murty Brown was trimming some
bush timber and Abner Boker sat on the
grass looking on.
“Well, what do you think you’re doin’?”
was the visitor’s greeting.
“Goin’ to stick up a bit of a shed,” said
Murty.
Old Bob took off his hat and mopped his
face with a big red handkerchief. He was
a tall man, with a billygoat beard and a bald
head that shone like polished coral, fringed
with a tuft of curls above each ear.
“Seen that nephew of mine, anywhere? .
JlO
“He was here not long ago,” Murty in-
formed him. “I think he’s gone to see about
a girl somewhere.”
"Just like him,” chuckled Old Bob. ‘ Just
like him.” He squatted against the wall and
set bis hat down carefully on the grass.
After a while he said : “I don’t know what’s
the matter with Mat at all. He’s done
enough spooniwinkim’ to have stocked a
harem. But he don’t go off somehow. He’s
over 26 now, an’ he started courtin’ when
he was 17.”
“He was lucky to escape,” said Abner,
whose married life was not all he had ex-
pected. “My old tart took care that I left
off where I started, or I might ’ave got
sense with experience. But seventeen’s only
calf love.”
“Well, there were cows in it an’ calves
too, but mostly cows,” said Old Bob. “An’
the lowun’ o’ cows got to be one of the
hauntin’ associations, so to speak; We lived
near Lapp’s sawmill; an’ Amy Lapp used
to come to our yard in the morning with a
billycan. She always brought a bun with her,
too. Mat liked buns, an’ encouraged her by
givin’ double measure an’ leavin’ me short.
But seein’ him always in the yard, I. don’t
think she liked the smell of him an’ froze off
as soon as he started to show his improvin’
regards, so to speak. Then her little brother
came a few mornings with the can, but he
didn’t bring any buns an’ got such small
measure by way of discouragement that the
Lapps left off sendin’ for milk.
“That didn’t worry Mat very much. In
a day or two he was cultivatin’ Marian
Winks, the blacksmith’s daughter. I got
the first hint of that when Mat took his
horse down to get it shod twice in one week.
He got the front shoes put on first trip an’
the hind shoes the next. Then he ran me
up a bill of £9 for doin’ up implements and
one thing an’ another that he’d damaged.
If he went outside with the cart, the tyre
would come off or a bolt would drop out,
an’ he’d have to take it to the blacksmith’s.
I wasn’t very much gone on Marian myself.
Her approaches were too expensive, so to
speak. When I kicked up a fuss about the
bill I got from her old man, Mat went an’
got a job with him as striker. That lasted
some months, an’ ended in a bust-up between
him and Marian because she was delayin’
the butcher too long every time he came
round. She was a strong-headed girl who
believed in having her fling while she was
Miss. She married the postman.
“Not long after Mat came back, I noticed
him accumulatin’ an extraordinary collec-
tion of things from the store. He spent all
his income, as it came in, buyin' things he
didn’t want. An’ he wouldn’t go into that
store, or ride past it in business hours, unless
he was dressed up. You know, Mat’s a bit
stylish where there’s girls. At work about
home he was pretty often a picture for a
comic artist; an’ if a girl came along that
he was sweet on, or was likely to be, he’d
dive into a hollow log rather than be seen
in his scarecrows. His shoppin’ fit knocked
him clean out of himself, so to speak. By
an’ bye I discovered that V.V., as we. called
Violet Vester. was behind the counter, an’
Mat was buyin’ to see her. He might have
bought the store in time, but. he wasn’t toffy
enough for V.V. She vdas a stylish little
piece of goods, all beaming in the store, an’
a frozen image that couldn’t see you at 10
paces outside.
“How;ever, lie didn’t worry over Violet.
He’d no sooner faded out there than he
met Phyllis Green. Her father was timber-
gettin’ for _ the sawmill. I sold him some
good, trees in iny paddock; an’ while he was
cuttin’ there Phyllis brought him his dinner
on horseback. That’s how Mat came to
notice that she had a shy twinkle in her
eyes, a pretty dimple, an’ a smile that was
as sweet as honey. Perhaps that reminded
him of bees’ nests. A great longin’ came on
him for honeycomb. He wanted to find a
sugar-bag badly, an’ used to go off about the
dinner hour moochin’ round trees, instead of
having his usual smoke-o on the verandah
—an’ always round where Green was
workin’. Used to shave himself at all times
of the week, too, instead of only on Sunday
mornin’. Couldn’t go down the paddock for
the old cart-horse without shavin’ himself
first. An’ it was surprisin’ what a lot of
things Green lost or mislaid in that paddock,
includin’ his pipe an’ pocket-knife, a two-
foot rule, a bullock-whip, an’ some wedges.
Mat found ’em one at a time where he’d
planted them an’ took them over to Green’s
house when he wanted to see Phyllis. An’
after all she yoked up with a bullock-
puncher who sometimes worked with her
father. That was where he had the pull on
Mat. He was on the spot, where it wasn’t
necessary to look for sugarbags or hide the
bullock-whip.
“Then Mat reckoned our cows were goin’
off their milk in the paddock. He turned
them into the bush in the morning; an’ they
certainly did improve—in consequence of
Mat milkin’ ’em better. But he took a long-
time musterin’ them in the afternoon. Often
he came home with the horse in a lather o’
sweat. I found that Ganter’s cows were
runnin’ in the bush too ; an’ Madge Ganter
used to go after them. Madge was real
bush. She liked jumpin’ logs; an’ she an’
Mat used to have jumpin’ contests an’ races
till Dad Ganter caught them at it an’ put
a stopper on Madge’s wild ridin’ exercises.
“Mat was mopey for a bit after that.
Couldn’t eat his porridge in the morning an’
took no interest in the rubber o’ dominoes
we used to play in the evening. He’d been
having such good times with Madge an’
missed her. But he wasn’t euchred alto-
gether.
“He took to goin’ out at night to give
the dogs a run after ’possums. There was
always more fun, though, in chasin’ ’possums
near Ganter’s than anywhere else. They
soon got as scarce as bunyips, an’ then Mat
would shoot one near home, carry it up to
Ganter’s an’ fire his gun off under a tree
near the house. When Dad Ganter an’ the
boy an’ Madge ran out to investigate, he’d
pick up the ’possum he’d thrown down there
as a guarantee of his bona fid'es, so to speak.
He repeated that about 14 times before Dad
Ganter got suspicious and laid for him. That
night he couldn’t find a ’possum handy, so
he got the one he’d shot the night before,
which the crows had been pickin’ at, an’
gave it another funeral. That tickled Gan-
ter more than anything, when he’d surprised
Mat by risin’ up unexpected from the wood-
heap. The dead finish was that a strange
young man came out from the house to
join in the laugh, an’ he had his arm round
Madge’s waist.
“Mat felt a bit humiliated over that. It
was nearly a month before he started to
sing again or to admire the beautiful sun-
set from the back door. He’d got acquainted
by that time with Agnes Finn. But he was
too swift for Agnes. She was a serious sort
of girl, with dark eyes an’ dark hair. An’
the serious sort of girl has to be approached
with due regard to formalities. It’s the play-
ful, mischievous sort that you can grab hold
of an’ kiss. But girls were just girls to
Mat, ail for cuddliff’ purposes, whether they
were dark or sandy. We called at Finn’s
one afternoon while ridin’ through that way,
an’ stayed for tea. In the dusk Agnes went
out to catch some chickens that had taken
to roostin’ in the cartshed; an’ Mat went
with her to hold the light. I engineered him
into that because I rather liked Agnes. She
was a great little housekeeper. But pokin’
about with a pretty girl in the starry night
and the perfumed air was too rapturous for
Mat. He caught hold of her and kissed her;
an’ she retaliated like a snake that’s been
trodden on. Smacked him across the mouth.
It was such a mighty swipe that she was
inside some minutes before he’d found his
hat; an’ when he came in he wasi red an’
bashful-lookin’. He kept screwin’ his lips
about as if they didn’t fit properly. Agnes
must have told her mother, for the old woman
looked at him as if he was a dreadful per-
son ; an’ she must have passed it on to Finn,
for he became a bit offish, too, without ex-
plainin’ himself. So we didn’t stay long.
“We started visiting the Cowderys about
that time, an’ Mat an’ Mrs. Cowdery got
to be great friends. Her daughter, Pauline,
was nice an’ sociable, too; an’ it looked like
a steady progress to weddin’ bells. But that
smack from Agnes Finn had knocked all the
initiative out of Mat’s courtin’. He liked
Pauline well enough, but only discovered
that he wanted her an’ thought she wanted
him when he was thousands of miles away
an’ it was too late.
“What sent him adrift was the funniest
thing that ever skittled his intentions, so to
speak. The lady in the case was a gay
little butterfly who called herself Pearl
Brune. A fluffy-headed girl, with plenty of
sparkle an’ substance in her. She was mas-
queradin’ as nurse-girl an’ drill-sergeant of
table manners, or something like that, in a
newly-rich family of the Woop Woop class.
She took a likin’ to Mat straight away, an’
gave him the time of his life. They rode to
all the local sights an’ shows together, an’
sat on all the logs around at night-time.
They walked out, too, Mat carryin’ the baby
or shovin’ the pram. As she could play
an’ sing very nicely and he felt uncomfort-
ably useless at indoor sociables, he touched
me for a rise that he hadn’t earned, an’
started takin’ music lessons. He did learn
to play a bit, but got a grouch on me at
times because I wouldn’t buy a piano to
make our old caboose more homely. I told
him that instead of trainin’ up to her, he
ought to teach her Back Creek ways an’
how to make pancakes. Not that I
cared what sort of partner he took,
as long as she -was respectable; but
more harmony can be got out of cooking
utensils than out of pianos. Pearl Brune •
was new to country life, but she was en-
thusiastic an’ wanted to learn all about the
bush. Nothing pleased her better, when she
had a day off once a week, than to visit bush
camps an’ have dinner with the men. Of
course, Mat took the day off whether we

Are you troubled with Pimples, Blotches, Blackheads, or
other distressing skin affections of Springtime? These troubles,
if neglected, are apt to develop into serious skin disease.
You need Zam-Buk to soothe and purify your skin—to give it a real “Spring
clean. Zam-Buk s antiseptic herbal essences are so highly refined that they get
right to the root of the trouble; they rouse the pores to healthy action; improve the
circulation and cleanse and stimulate the underlying tissues. Thus Zam-Buk enables
the skin to rid itself of all winter impurities.
To all who have a tendency to skin trouble of any sort, a daily dressing of
Zam-Buk is of the utmost benefit. Never use common ointments or pore-clogging
cosmetics on a tender, troublesome skin. Their impure animal fats and minerals are
always liable to set up irritation and inflammation. Zam-Buk, however, you
have the safest and surest skin remedy yet discovered. There’s nothing else so
soothing and purifying.

“However, the next development blew up
the prospectus, so to speak. I picked up a
notebook under a shady tree, and, inquirin'
into, it, found some notes an’ records of
special interest to my amorous nephew. It
belonged to Pearl Brune. She had jotted
down an honest description of Mat and his
mannerisms, what lie had said to her at
different times, an’ how he had told her of
his undyin’ love. Very embarrassing parti-
culars they' were; but she had similar re-
cords or nine other trustin’ young men that
her winnin’ ways had captivated.
‘Miss Pearl Brune was a lady-writer, ot
rich but honorable parents, who lived in a
grand house, somewhere ‘down below’—a
house that it took half-a-dozen servants to look
after, including the chauffeur an’ the gar-
dener. She was studyin’ the home life of
bush-settlers, especially the associations of
young people an’ the way they went about
their courtin’.
“Poor Mat had been prospected for a bit of
local color, so to speak.”
EDWARD S. SORENSON.
The Elder Son.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DAKIvNESS had come with a chill
mist off the sea, and menacing-
shadows hung about the narrow
lanes of Surry Hills. There was silence,
broken only by the distant snarl of angry
voices where a man and his woman spat
blasphemous venom. Uncertain footsteps
approached. The sound of a scuffle followed,
the dull thud of a blow, the ring of a dropped
stick, the crash of a breaking bottle. And
then the pad, pad of running feet. A young-
man was making in the direction of China-
town, hugging the dark streets and byways
as he went.
And now came another man, much like
him, but in working clothes, walking rapidly
as though in agitation. In his abstraction
he brushed past two people who hailed him.
They were puzzled.
“Somethin’s wrong with Snowy Walker,”
said one. “Somethin’ muster ’appened.”
Snowy’s wrath had been stirred by a little
thing: the news that his brother Jack had
been seen wearing his (Snowy’s) new suit
of clothes. The information exacerbated the
brooding resentment which his mother’s pre-
ference for her younger son had implanted in
Snowy’s heart.
Since boyhood he had worked to maintain
his mother and her home. But all her love
was for Jack. Snowy, an honest worker
himself, knew in his heart that Jack was a
thief and a loafer; but his mother made
eager, voluble excuses. It was not Jack’s
fault that hq could not get work, she claimed ;
and Snowy thought bitterly of what woulu
have happened to the household if he had
made a similar excuse. lie had had to get
work and keep it.
But he was powerless. When he swore
to turn his wastrel brother out of the house
his mother tigerishly reproached him, defied
him, saying that she would go also. And
Snowy, believing her, dropped the subject.
Yet he raged when he thought that he,
working hard and giving everything, was
passed over in affection for a waster whose
nature knew nothing but selfishness.
He came to a door, and his hand went
into the darkness for the key which was
usually outside. It had gone. He thumped
on the panels, and fancied that a silence
fell within. He called “It’s Bill!” and then
his mother opened the door.
In the kitchen, before a wash-basin, stood
a young man much resembling himself.
"What the hell do you mean by wearing
my clobber?” began Snowy; and then he sud-
denly sensed something that smote his heart
with fear. His mother was agitated and
tear-stained; his brother’s face was white,
and his hands, as he wiped them on a towel,
were shaking. And he saw that the water
in the basin was red.
“My God, what’s the matter?” he asked.
“Aw —nothin’. Just a fight.”
“No, no, Jack; tell ’im; ’e must know,”
said the mother tearfully.
“Well, it’s this,” said Jack with peevish
resentment. “It’s all because I never ’ad
enough money. I wanted money, that’s
what. An’ that’s why it ’appened. If I’d
’ad money it wouldn’t.”
“Damn you,” said Snowy, “can’t you say
what happened?”
“I’m tellin’ yer. I was talkin’ to Chiller
Mack and ther mob when old Purvis, the
grocer, went by, boozed, as usual. I says
that it would be easy to get ’is roll; an’ I
went after ’im. But ’e struggled, an’ I ’ii
’im on the ’ead with a bottle.”
“My pore, pore boy!” sobbed Mrs. Walker.
Snowy drew a gasping breath. His eye
went to the reddened water in the basin.
“You mean you killed him?”
“No, I didn’t. Any’ow, I never meant to,
I simply ’it ’im on the ’ead with a bottle
like any other cove mighter done. It was ’is
fault fer puttin’ up a fight. I thought ’e was
drunk ; an’ what does a man want to be goin’
about boozed for with a roll of notes in ’is
pocket? It’s ’is fault, I tell yer. What
are you glarin’ at me for? I didn’t go for
to kill ’im.”
“But lie’s dead !”
“Well, why was ’is ’ead that soft that it
would break when ’e was ’it with a bottle?”
Snowy turned to his mother. “How can
you love ’im?” lie raged. “This cur who
knows he’s killed a man, but can’t say it
straight out, even to us; ’oo’s been a thief
and a blackguard, and made his friends
amongst thugs all his life, and is now a
murderer ?”
.“Oh, Bill, Bill, don’t say such things!
’H’s not bad—you know that. ’E was
different to you. ’E wasn’t made for work.”
Snowy turned on his brother. “What are
you goin’ to do?”
“Do?”
“Yes — do. I know you won’t do what a
man would—give yourself up and face it
out. You haven’t the guts. What are you
goin’ to do?”
“The Johns might not find out I done it.”
"If they rope in your pal Chiller Mack
you’re gone a million. He’ll lose ’is block
and give you away for certain. An’ serve
you damn well right.” .
"Perhaps you’ll turn pimp an’ give me
up?” sneered the other, white-faced. “I
know all you care for me.”
"No, no, no, Bill; you’ll help him. For
his mother’s sake,” pleaded Mrs. Walker
piteously.
Snowy put his arm round her.
"He’s iny brother!” he said, “an’ I ain't
goin’ to put ’im away. But”
The handle of the front door rattled.
Jack’s face went white as his brother
pushed him out of the kitchen.
“Mrs. Walker! Mrs. Walker!” A scraggy
young woman, breathless with excitement,
appeared in the kitchen doorway. “Mrs.
AYalker,” and she entered. “Old man Purvis
’as been picked up dead in Ann-street, an’
the Johns ’ave took Chiller Mack. Artie
Stevens come up to say as ’ow your son
was mixed up in it, and arsked me to warn
you to tell ’im to keep clear.”
"My son wouldn’t do nothin’ like that.”
The girl looked at Snowy.
“I saw ’im cornin’ along the street lookin’
excited,” she said. “An’ I was afraid some-
thin’ ’ad ’appened.”
Jack crept back as the door closed behind
her.
“You’re my brother,” said Snowy to him,
“an’ I’ll see yer through. Get off them
clothes and into your own clobber.”
Jack saw the point. There was nothing
quiet about his brother’s best clothes; and
if anybody had seen him in that array kc-
would soon be identified. Quickly he climbed
the creaking, uncarpeted stairs that opened
off the front room.
The scraggy woman burst in again, more
excited than ever. “Mrs. Walker,” she
gasped, “there’s a John watchin’ the end
of the lane. Thought you’d like to know.”
Mother and son looked blankly at each
other as she scuttled off.
“Oh, Bill, Bill, my ’eart’s broke,” sobbed
the woman. “Save ’im now—save ’im. If
’e’s took I might as well die.” He felt the
hurt—the same hurt that had been in his
heart for all the years he could remember.
Yet for her embrace, for her very appeal to
him, he was grateful. Gently, very gently,
he put her on a chair.
* “Mum,” he said, “I’ll do what I can. Let
me think.”
As he paced the floor his ears were pricked
for the sounds outside that would tell of the
approach of the police. He knew the net
they could set, once their quarry was marked ;
and he believed that arrest was inevitable,
even if his brother could get away. Living
in the underworld he knew the weak points
in its supposed unity against the law. The
nefarious .businesses of the neighbors would
make themeager to gain favor with the
police—and the claim to immunity it would
bring—by betraying the fugitive. Suddenly
he remembered the way Ellen had looked
at him. Clearly she thought he was the
guilty man. An idea came to him. Surely
if only for a time he made a sacrifice, whilst
his brother, like a sneak, stood by, their
mother would give him a share of the love
that all his- life lie had tried and failed to
win.
“Mum,” he said. “Jack was wearing my
clothes. The Johns will have been told what
they’re like. When they come, if I’m dressed
in those clothes, they’ll take me ; and, when
they’ve gone, he can get away.”
“Bill! Bill!” she cried. “Oh, Bill! I
knew you would save my boy ! You will, Bill,
you will, won’t you?”
Not a thought for him! There was a stab
for his heart in each word she spoke. Yet
as she threw her arms about his neck and
kissed him he felt that even though her
kisses were only an expression of gratitude
for the saving of another, they made his
sacrifice worth while.
When the police came a man in a flashly-
cut grey suit opened the door. They were
puzzled. They had come expecting to find
John Walker in those clothes.
“I’ll go quietly. I expect it’s me you
want,” said Snowy. lie walked away
with them exultantly. His sacrifice must
win him her affection ; and later, when the
brother who was cowering in the room above
had gone away and his own innocence was
established, they would live together happily.
a * * *
The first blow Snowy experienced was
when he saw the brother whom he hoped had
escaped sitting in court with Chiller Mack.
He had looked to this as the day of his vin-
dication ; had dreamed happy dreams about
it; and now, if he was vindicated, his brother
would be caught. Why was the fool there?
The evidence began.
What was happening? Chiller Mack, pimp
and perjurer, went into the box first. He
had been speaking to Walker. He was wear-
ing his grey suit. Yes; it was William
Walker. He had said when Purvis came
a10ng.... And then Ellen. Walker had
rushed past her. He seemed agitated. She
did not notice his clothes, but knew it was
William Walker.. . .And Barnes. He had
hailed Walker, who brushed past without
answering.
Snowy saw that a monstrous case was
forming against him. But his mother would
clear him—his mother for whose sake he
had gone to prison. They were calling her
now. He roused himself.
She gave her evidence with sobs, her face
dotvn, as though in shame. Yes; she knew
the suit, produced. It belonged to her son
—William Walker. She had first noticed
the stains on the sleeve on the night of May-
-19. He had been wearing the suit....
Great blows 'were beating in , Snowy’s
brain, smashing all his dreams, into dust.
He saw it now; he was still as nothing ,
the mother’s love remained for the sneak-
thief and murderer. To make him safe she
was prepared to give perjured testimony
against the son whose heart had starved for
her affection.
The drone of the court went on, but his
stunned ears heard nothing.
