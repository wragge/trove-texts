The Red Pege
SYDNEY SURGEON
Matthew Banks, plastic surgeon, has
strayed a long way from the opening
pages of No Man Despairs, by Alan
Mitchell (Harrap), where he is born
at Roseville, Sydney, of a Scottish
family of marine-surveyors with a big
house at Balmain. A medical student
at Sydney University, he was first-
assistant to the famous surgeon Sir
Alexander MacCormick before, in
1924, he qualified in medicine. He
became the first doctor of South Wood-
bum, 30 miles from Lismore, opening
in what had been a butcher-shop.
It’s a bit of a shock that so many
of his early cases die; they make a
grim picture of the crudity of Aus-
tralian country medicine as late as the
’twenties, and most are adduced as illus-
trations of lives that might have been
saved in these days of penicillin, etc.
By 1927 he was brought in to share a
practice at Lismore; and there he took
up flying, and did things like landing
on a beach at Evans Head to get a girl
with peritonitis to hospital at Lismore.
By 1932, at the age of 34, he had moved
to Sydney and a partnership in a
Macquarie Street surgery, still on call
to fly to Bourke and pick up a lad
bleeding to death, etc., and it was
around this time he had a run-in with
Sister Kenny, whose lawyers mentioned
£5OOO, but didn’t go on with it.
With the opening of World War II
he joined the Navy; and this time got
the adventures his youth had denied
him in 1918. As naval surgeon on the
armed merchantman Moreton Bay, he
patrolled waters in the China Seas, with
relaxations in Hong Kong; then in the
Indian Ocean; and then they had an
encounter, while convoying, with the
Admiral Scheer, which curiously, and
luckily, turned and ran. Next, in
England, he joined the Fleet Air Arm,
to make experiments with oxygen at
heights, and, as naval surgeon, had
instructions to go through all the drill
of naval flying so that he would under-
stand the stresses and strains on naval
pilots; and this seems to have given
him considerable pleasure. Next, in
the big carrier Furious, in a Mediter-
ranean convoy, he saw the equally big
carrier Eagle hit with four torpedoes
and sunk in nine minutes.
He returned from leave in Australia
in time to join in the mass-operations
at Calderstone on soldiers wounded in
the Normandy invasion; and from this
he graduated to plastic surgery under
Sir Harold Gillies —the chapter on how
he developed the art of remaking jaws
that had been blown away, and graft-
ing skin from the stomach on grafted
bone is one of the most fascinating, if
repulsive, in the book.
He resumed his interest in flying for
pleasure after the war; flew to Baghdad
to see a former patient, and there was
persuaded to look after some more
patients—and this led to his becoming
a Baghdad Professor of Surgery for
half die year, and to his wife and
mother-in-law, at his place in Surrey,
being able to go hunting on an Arab
stallion and mare, the gift of grateful
Baghdad magnificoes.
The book concludes with an account
of Banks’s operations on patients
hypnotised by the American A. A.
Mason; and of the technique of
cosmetic-surgery, with special reference
to the reconstruction of a ballet-
dancer’s nose. If anything, these are
even more interesting than the chapter
on skin-grafting—all-in-all, as a book
of adventure by sea, land and air,
with experiments and developments in
surgery thrown in, its freshness and
variety have been a pleasant surprise
to a reviewer who took it up as just
another job.
Talking Musicians
In Composers on Music, an
Anthology of Composers’ Writings
(Faber) editor Sam Morgenstem has
rummaged through musicians’ letters,
diaries, essays and reviews to present
an overall first-person picture of music
by 90 men who made and make it.
Except for a brief introductory
section at the top of each chapter,
giving life-details of the composer, the
musicians themselves do all the talk-
ing. It is a book best judged by the
wide range of information it contains,
not, as in a novel, by its prose-quality.
These are men on their home-ground;
when experts speak, considerations of
mere writing ability fade. This does
not preclude occasional striking bursts,
notably by such men as Schumann
and Saint-Saens —critics as well as com-
posers—nor does it satisfactorily
account for Schoenberg’s wordy
attempt to explain the 12-tone system,
starting from his maxim that “com-
position with 12 tones has no other
aim than comprehensibility.” But this
apparently is a feature of contemporary
writing on modern music: one has only
to glance at Humphrey Searle’s
“Twentieth Century Counterpoint.”
The book ranges from Palestrina
(several of his dedications are given;
for flowered tongue-in-cheek flattery
they leave J. S. Bach’s for dead)
through Morley, Monteverdi and
Purcell. There is an interesting remark
by Telemann: “If there is nothing new
to be found in melody then we must
seek novelty in harmony.” This was
said 16 years before his death, and
probably he realised that all Europe
was buzzing with charming and
elegantly slight melodies- -how, one
wonders, would the gentle Telemann
have reacted to Milhaud’s poly-
tonality?
You find Glinka on Berlioz: —•
In the realm of fantasy, no one
has such colossal invention; and
his musical combinations possess,
among all their other merits, the
quality of true novelty. Breadth in
ensemble, abundance of detail, a
compact harmonic tissue, powerful
and until now unheard-of orchestra-
tion are the attributes of Berlioz’
music . . .
A bare six pages on Mendelssohn,
after discussing “Scholarly versus
‘People’s’ Music,” invites the reader to
..hear about Berlioz and his
music. He makes me sad, because
he is really a cultured, agreeable
man and yet composes so very
badly.
This crossfire of opinion is a unifying
feature of the book, drawing together
a composer’s qualities and shortcom-
ings, all sifted through specialist brains,
so that the onlooker may endeavor to
make a final evaluation. Here he is
helped by having not merely a fully
represented body of musicians from
one particular period but a selection
of the big names from the 16th century
to the 20th.

AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN
'T'HE Japanese Trade Fair, the first of
A a series in Australian capitals,
opened in Sydney last week, is an illus-
tration of Japanese capacity for
recovery, and that Japan is again an
economic Power, if not a military one,
to be studied and reckoned with.
It is two years short of a decade since
the Allied occupation of Japan ended
and the Americans moved out, leaving
behind considerable capital and inter-
locking interests. They left priding
themselves that they had turned Japan
into a “democratic country,” with
peasant ownership of the land and the
financial combinations of the Zaibutsu
destroyed for ever. If there was any
cause for rejoicing at the change, the
Japanese themselves soon dissipated it.
The industrialists returned to their
homes and neatly put together the jig-
saw pieces of their financial, commer-
cial and industrial systems. In doing
this they had the spur of necessity prod-
ding them, plus the advantage (like that
of bombed-out Germany) that all the
scrapping of the obsolete and the obso-
lescent had been done for them in a
huge surgical, hacking operation by
the Americans.
The results of Japanese reorganisa-
tion have been far more staggering
than those achieved in Germany
because of their isolation on the Com-
munist Asian fringe and the fact that
they are short on raw materials,
especially fuels and rough textiles, and
that they have, during their self-
habilitation. been compelled to feed as
much as they can of a population grow-
ing at the rate of a million a year or
more off a substantive 17-million acres
of arable land and the high seas.
Japan has presented the spec-
tacle of a furnace of energy, lead-
ing the world in reconstruction in the
past few years, despite the loss of two-
and - a - half - million people, mostly
youthful, during the war it so disas-
trously entered into, and sucking-
in everything new in technology from
the outside world, and' adapting,
improving and cheapening it.
And though its people suffered huge
retaliatory bombing and burnings in
their flimsy cities along the coast, des-
truction of communications and finally
a coup de grace from the atom-bombs,
there are none of the resentments —•
open, at any rate —of the West that are
evident in Russia and China, which
were aided by the British Common-
wealth and America during the war.
JANE thing is not evident in the new
Japan which was most feared in
the old. While it is still an economical
producer, its name as a manufacturer
is no longer associated with the shoddi-
ness and extreme cheapness which
marked its earlier pioneer efforts to
build-up international trade. Circum-
stances have called for abandonment
of the foreign low-price markets of
more backward Asia which tended to
be the Japanese pre-war target in trade.
The Japanese factory-owner has been
called-on to enter the Western mar-
kets with competitive goods, and it is
now common to see Japanese cameras
and precision-instruments and other
goods advertised in the American press
on equal price-terms with local pro-
ducts and with an appeal to the quality
market.
What has been done in Japan in the
past decade by strict attention to busi-
ness by every member of a population
of 90 million and a will to work is in
strong contrast to that of popula-
tions which tend to succumb to
the blandishments of Communist
gentlemen bent on producing the
failure of the capitalist systems of the
West. Cheap labor, of course, has had
its influence; but the standard of living
—the standard of the realities of com-
fort. rather than the artificialities —is
remarkably high.
The effects of the Japanese way of
life can be seen only in small samples
in the Japanese Trade Fair, but those
samples are enough to make it clear
that the Commonwealth has a neighbor
of immense achievement, and power
of recovery and potential almost with-
out limit, because it has devoted itself
in typically Japanese fashion to make
the most of its resources and whatever
other resources it can bring from out-
side into its scheme of progress.
Every year it becomes a nearer
neighbor. Before the war it was three
weeks away; after it. three days by
commercial aircraft; now the fastest
bombers could, full-out. reach Aus-
tralian territory in five hours with some
load up.
The exchange of a stream of delega-
tions and commercial visits, and the
first priority given by the Japanese to
the establishment of shipping connec-
tions with Australia, shows that at both
ends of the Japan-Australia axis the
closest economic co-operation and
political understanding are important.
JAPAN is now nearly our largest regu*
J lar woolbuyer and our largest
buyer of export coal. Australia is
necessarily a large buyer of Japanese
products and must continue to be so if
raw-material markets in Japan are to
be built-up. The final ambit of trade
is not by any means defined. No doubt
as the Japanese become meat-eaters, as
they surely will in a modern world,
our meat-markets in Japan will
expand; and if the Australian fishing
industry were as enterprising and far-
ranging as the Japanese, that could
be exploited on a major scale along
with timbers grown by cultivation, in
the production of which, with its tropi-
cal and sub-tropical climates, Australia
has a great advantage.
At the same time the position is one
which must be faced realistically.
Trade cannot be one-way, and though
our prime object is to expand the sale
of raw materials to the Japanese, there
must be an arrangement for a suffi-
cient intake of Japanese imports,
visible and invisible, to enable our
customers to pay for what they buy.
The Japanese position in Pacific
trade is becoming stronger with the
advances it is making in the tech-
niques of shipbuilding and with the
growing advantage in costs and freights
which it could, in emergency, display.
These and other complications call for
study, no less than the strategical value
of a close Japanese alliance and the
tactical military potential inherent in
Japanese possession of tremendous
factory-capacity for war as well as
peace, and in its tankerage and deep-
sea freight-carrying.
Politically. Japan has its own
curious system which most Westerners
are apt to regard as weak and dis-
orderly. but in fact its very disorderli-
ness is evidence of the tough co-
hesiveness of the core of Japanese life.
Its political set-up and nature in many
ways resemble those of France. And
the Japanese system is Western and
opposed to everything that Com-
munism stands for.
Therefore, however sound our
grounds for being watchful of Japan
after the experience of the last war. it is
vital to maintain Japan as a bulwark
against Communism, for. whatever the
potential of China, the actuality is that
so long as Japan continues to gain in
strength, the strongest nation on the
southern and eastern fringes of Asia
will be non-Communist. opposed to
Communist policies and the Pacific
Ocean virtually enclosed by the ring
of Western democracy.
It is vitally important that there shall
be no breach in that ring, and the
Japanese know even better than our-
selves that this is necessary to their
continued existence and development.


"WONDER HOW FAR THIS ONE'LL GO INTO THE INFLATION-SPHERE!"


PLAIN ENGLISH
A Communist Congress
The twenty-first Congress of the Soviet
Union Communist Party begins this
week with the usual boasting about the
tremendous progress of the U.S.S.R. and
the enormous plans with which it will
knock the world silly within the next
seven years.
Servile representatives from all over
the world, including Australia, will be
there. It is Communist theory that the
boundaries of the U.S.S.R. actually
stretch to the poles, though this is not
yet acknowledged by “backward” peoples
of Western Europe and America. It is
also theory, and always has been, even
when Russia was living in bloodbaths
and on dry crusts, that those who resist
this reality are having a thin time and
will suffer more as time goes on.
The Australian delegates • will be
expected to follow the example of
Mr. Sharkey at the last conference
he attended, and stand up to testify that
the Commonwealth is a backward, seeth-
ing mass of discontent, full of workers
who are being starved and forced to go
into rags so that the warmongering
Menzies Government can invest their
rightful earnings in nuclear bombs and
bayonets for the express purpose of
attacking the Communist bloc.
Khrushchev will use the conference as
he did the last one: not merely to con-
solidate his own power but to flaunt it
in the face of —he hopes—a frightened
world outside. He will be bolder know-
ing that he can count on the help of a
capitalist press, particularly in English-
speaking countries like Australia, to place
huge headlines over anything he cares to
say. *
The conference has been carefully pre-
pared for abroad by invitations to “lead-
ing newspapermen” to visit Russia and
“see for themselves,” so that they can
refute any “slanders.” These delegations,
as in. the case of a recent one from Aus-
tralia, consist of a majority of Com-
munists, with perhaps a professor to
give it an air of learning, and authority.
Nobody would, of course, fail to
rejoice at the economic progress of a
backward people. Had Russia not been
formed as a deliberately constituted
enemy of the rest of the world, with a
positive and unswerving plan of building-
up its resources to overthrow all other
systems and mould the universe into a
Communist whole, more favored nations
would have rushed to help its develop-
ment.
But the old Russia has not changed.
It is a sullen odd-man-out, predatory
nation, a prison to its own people, who
are not allowed out of its borders, a
menace to the rest of the world while
Communism survives. No agreement
can be made with it with any confidence.
By all the standards of the West it is
completely amoral.
The proceedings of the new Moscow
conference need to be viewed not through
the rosy haze induced by champagne-
parties to the smooth and smiling
Mikoyan, whose visit to the United States
was nicely timed to condition world
public-opinion for what comes out of
the congress, but across the minefields,
barbed-wire and gun-traps that close the
Austro-Hungarian border and the tens-
of-thousands of graves of the murdered
in the pleasant plains and cities beyond.
It is pitiful that each advance in power
in the grim fastnesses behind the Iron
Curtain spells not an advance in civilised
living for the world but fresh burdens
‘against the time when, if Communism
says what it means, it will try to turn
the inhabitants of the earth into jailbirds
in accord with the theory that there can
be no permanent peace without universal
conquest and immolation of every human
being who denies Communism.
Fares and C.-0.-l.
[From Canberra]
Commonwealth officials were alarmed,
to say the least, at the trend in living-
costs revealed this week by the Com-
monwealth Statistician, S. R. Carver.
His figures showed, under analysis,
that the average cost-of-living throughout
Australian capital cities rose by 4s. a
week in the quarter ended December 31
last, the largest increase for more than
12 months.
Federal officials fear that the figures
will spark-off a renewed demand by
unions for a complete review of the
basic wage and the method by which it
is determined. -
Besides quoting the allegedly infallible
figures of the Statistician, it is
expected that the unions will bolster their
case by referring to the Commonwealth’s
decision to have Federal Parliamentarians’
salaries reviewed.
Economists believe that any move for
a general review of wages and the wages-
structure at present could prove disastrous
to the Australian economy.
With falling export returns, particu-
larly from wool sales, Government
advisers look with horror upon any move
which could conceivably increase pro-
duction-costs in Australia. And nothing
will increase those costs more than in-
creased wages, whether they represent
a real increase in purchasing-power or
just an increase in the weekly return to
employees.
Officials have been scanning Mr.
Carver’s figures closely to see if they can
pinpoint where the main increase
occurred.
And they didn’t have to look too far.
It is stated quite plainly that the recent
substantial increase in transport fares
imposed in Victoria has had a lot to do
with the general average increase of 4s.
reflected over the six State capital cities.
It is being freely suggested that when
the next Premiers’ Conference assembles
in March, the Commonwealth may cen-
sure Victorian Premier Henry Bolte for
his decision that fares must be upped.
He gave no hint of it before the last
State elections in Victoria, and it has had
a wide-scale effect on living-costs in that
State.
Of all States that showed increased
costs in the last quarter, Victoria was the
highest.
D.L.P. Warning
All expectations, if any still existed,
that the D.L.P. might direct its sup-
porters to give their second preferences
to Labor at the coming N.S.W. elections
have been dispelled by the statement
issued by the D.L.P. Federal executive
at the end of the party's two-day con-
ference in Sydney.
The statement warned the A.L.P. that
unless it took “remedial action" it must
expect to meet the same “overwhelming
disaster” in the State elections —polls are
due in N.S.W., South Australia, Westralia
and Tasmania that befell it in the
Federal election last November.
Stating that the D.L.P. “will not co-
operate in any way with the A.L.P.
while that party is associated with Com-
munism and corruption,” it continued:
As D.L.P. preferences are now the
determining factor in Australian political
decisions, the A.L.P. must blame itself if
failure to put its house in order brings
additional disasters.
Six factors, said the statement, contri-
buted to the defeat of Labor in the
Federal election:
(1) The party’s leadership.
(2) Its foreign policy, which threatened
Australia’s security.
(3) Its co-operation with Communism in
issues like unity-tickets, indemnity pay-
ments and victimisation of the Hurseys.
(4) Its retention of outmoded policies,
including Socialism.
(5) Factionalism, opportunism and sec-
tarianism in every State.
(6) Infiltration into the A.L.P. of corrupt
elements, particularly in State and muni-
cipal politics.
After the statement had been issued,
general-secretary Kane said no decision
had been reached on the allocation of
preferences in the N.S.W. election ; the
party would meet later to discuss this.
No Labor man in a shaky seat is likely
to find many crumbs of comfort in that
postcript. If the D.L.P., after this (and
previous) statements of policy gives its
preferences to the A.L.P. it will be equi-
valent to admitting that its four years
of campaigning have been a phony war.
Noisy Jefports
How to keep up with the jet age with-
out being prematurely aged by its noise
and vibration is a civic problem for
Melbourne as for some other cities.
Nobody has yet found the answer. And,
when Senator Paltridge met representa-
tives of citizens who have taken fright
at the expert panel’s recommendation to
build the Melbourne jetport at Tulla-
marine, now in the quiet country, he
could not find an answer to turn away
all their wrath.
The Senator, who is Minister for Civil
Aviation, took some of his highest-
powered advisers along with him to the
deputation. All were concerned to play-
down the noise the jets would make at
Tullamarine. It wouldn’t be as great
there, they said, as in New York or
London. But the deputation, having
read about screaming children, gibbering
invalids, shaken walls, and all hell let


loose in the jet-streams abroad, was
mostly unconvinced.
After two hours of hearing objections,
and also the admission of one neighbor-
ing shire council’s representative that his
council favored the site as a jetport, the
best Paltridge could promise was that
Cabinet might not make a final decision,
for three or four months. R. N. Hug'nes-
Jones, for- Tullamarine residents, made
it clear that Tullamarine still didn’t want
the honor of providing an international
jetport. Its land, he said, was too
valuable. He wanted the Commonwealth
to take liability for damage and dis-
comfort the jetport would cause, and
dwelt eagerly on the superior virtues of
other sites.
Progress is a very prickly thing. Time
was when local residents eagerly manned
deputations to bring Government works
to their areas. If there is any solution
to this jetport problem about which
only people who don’t live near the site
can take broad and detached views—it
seems to lie with the backroom boys.
They invented the jet engine. Let them
silence it.
Cahill's New Dilemma
The putting-back of the Federal A.L.P.
Triennial Conference from March to
May is a retreat which the Cahill Govern-
ment will welcome but which the Play-
ford Government in S.A. will not.
The A.L.P. is obviously frightened to
have the conference during or before
either election-campaign, and it would
be just like Playford to time his elec-
tion to take place during the meeting,
a procedure which would have devastat-
ing effects, especially in view of the very
vocal campaign of the Communist party
in the Croweaters’ State and its firm
asseverations of love for unity with
Labor.
The Communists of S.A. are already
in the field with a team of candidates and
with a programme which involves first
preferences to Labor candidates, aboli-
tion of the Woomera Rocket Range and
Maralinga testing-ground (with, of course,
the parallel industries that have given
work to thousands of Australians),
drastic cuts in the Commonwealth
defence plans, the saving to be channelled
into “peaceful constructive pursuits....
allowing more money for housing, educa-
tion, health facilities and public works
and secondary industries.”
The par.ty proposes to forward these
programmes at both State elections, and
this is going to be awkward for Mr.
Cahill, since he can’t avoid close associa-
tion with the Communist-led unions.
With his narrow margin of electorates,
he must depend on funds from unions
infiltrated to the neck with Communists
and openly advocating through their
leaders the Communist programme to
finance his election and drum-up votes
for him in the waterside areas.
He may not love these unions and the
Communists, but he can love them better
before a Federal conference which is
sure to spawn a programme very much
in line with the Communist-party policy
than after it, when he would have the
burden of decisions come to with the
support or acquiescence of his own State
executive heads and in line with the
Communist-party’s line.
The Opposition parties will be a poor
lot if they cannot win the N.S.W. election.
The earlier the Liberal-C.P. policy is
defined in N.S.W. and the more basic
and free of specific promises (except those
to clean-up present political corruption)
it is, the better for its chances. Mr.
Menzies’s example was a good one.
Sold on Sight!
Australian overseas publicity (B.
21/1/’59)? Join the P. and O. service
in the U.K. and settle in Australia!
Since the 700-ton steamer Chusan
in 1852 established the first regular mails
between England and Australia, the
P. and O. service has become more and
more domestically involved in this
country. Many P. and O. captains and
officers have married Australian girls or
have made their home here.
A recently retired P. and O.
commodore who had made his home
in Sydney for many years before swallow-
ing the anchor has continued to live
there, although both he and his wife are
English.
Of four captains of P. and O.’s large
passenger vessels (Arcadia, Strathnaver,
Himalaya and Stratheden), one has his
home in Melbourne, another just out-
side Sydney, a third in Merimbula on
the N.S.W. south coast, and the fourth
married a Sydney girl and set -up
home in England. There are numerous
others, including a chief-engineer who
has made his home in Sydney, and two
pursers, one of whom lives in Sydney
and the other in Melbourne.
The British India Steam Navigation
Co. (more generally known as the B.I.),
whose vessels have for many years main-
tained various services between Australia
and India, Pakistan, Persian Gulf,
United Kingdom, etc., also has many
family-ties with Australia.
8.1. captains and officers have married
Australian girls or have set-up home in
Australia, whilst others who have
travelled widely have decided to spend

Child-marriages
[From Canberra]
Statistical officials have laughed - off
criticisms that child-marriages in Aus-
tralia are a disgrace to a British com-
munity.
The criticisms were voiced in an article
in a London Sunday newspaper, “The
People,” which said that if the N.S.W.,
Victoria and Queensland Governments
did not act to prevent this “survival of
primitive days,” they would shame them-
selves for ever in the eyes of all decent
people of the British Commonwealth.
The statistical experts replied that child-
marriages in Australia were not inordi-
nately high, and it had to be remembered
that in published figures marriages of
half-castes were included. This some-
times made the figures appear to be high,
as early marriages were much more
prevalent among half-castes than they
were among the white population.
Child-marriage figures in Australia do
not vary greatly from year to year. In
1955 there were three brides aged 13,
and 22 aged 14. The grooms of the three
13-year-olds were 17, 21 and 25, while in
the same year there were two bridegrooms
aged 15, and 26 aged 16.
One of the 15-year-old boys married
a girl the same age, while the other wed
a 16-year-old miss.
In 1956 there were 60 brides or bride-
grooms aged 16 or less. Of these, two
brides were 13, 29 were 14, while three
of the bridegrooms were 15, and 26 were
16 years of age.
The figures for 1957 showed two
13-year-old and 34 14-year-old brides.
Figures for 1958 are not yet available.
Statists say that British newspapers
have been making a fuss about Austra-
lian marriages for years, but, in general,
their complaints and criticisms have been
ill-founded.
It is 'impossible to make a com-
parison between child-marriages in Aus-
tralia and Britain because figures of
marriages of children under 16 are not
published in Britain.
A Poet's Tribute
[From “MacHoots."]
Among my treasures of Australiana I
discovered the other day a little piece
entitled “To the Memory of John Norton,
the People’s Tribune.” Written by one
P. F. Collins, it seems to have been dis-
tributed as a broadsheet, or dodger, at
the time of Norton’s death in 1916.
Perhaps, in view of Wild Men of
Sydney and all that, part of it should
see the light again. It has, in any case,
a naive charm of its own:
So favorable a view of this contro-
versial figure seems to prove something ;
but what, I hesitate to say. Only here,
surely, is one piece of writing that would
find favor with the sponsors of the
N.S.W. Defamation Act.
A brilliant man has passed away,
John Norton was his name;
He made the tyrants shake with fear,
The coward blush with shame.
Like Rienzi who tried to free
The serfs of ancient Rome,
He sought to elevate the poor
And brighten every home.
The more they tried to crush him down,
More powerful he arose
To strike again avaricious knaves
And scarified his foes.
He was a thorough sporting man,
As all Australians know,
Many silent tears were shed
Because he’s lying low.


Society
T>orn chronologically as well as
geographically a Victorian, I
confront a motor-driving licence-applica-
tion and mourn over my blemished
driving-record. Driving my 1910 Over-
land, I was pursued, overtaken and
nudged ignominiously to the kerb by
traffic-constable Rice, a handsome 14-
stoner, equipped with a racing pushbike
and, most appositely, an impressive
handlebar moustache. The resultant con-
viction was for exceeding 20 m.p.h. on
St. Kilda Road ; the fine was 5s. —

“Grease Spot”: Sydney’s heat-wave

tion of Mum, usually the first to feel
the heat, who did her chores cheerfully,
apparently unaffected. To all our moans
she merely replied: “It’s not that bad.
I’ve known it worse.” This had us
puzzled, until we discovered that she is
reading a book about Tibet, and instead
of sweltering in the sticky humidity her
mind is far away in the icy, snow-capped
peaks of the Himalayas!

“Billy See”: Pub names in Australia
seldom strike a note of originality,
hoteliers being rather dim bulbs. Royals,
Grands and Railways bob-up everywhere,
and it’s a poor town that doesn’t sport
a Red Lion. An attempt at originality
in Perth is the Boomerang. But in a life
that now reaches out towards 80 I’ve met
only one true poetic effort, His Lord-
ship’s Larder, that used to grace the
purlieus of Fremantle wharves long
since altered to something utterly com-
monplace.

“Fontaine”: The Bulletin’s recollec-
tion (17/12/’5B) that the late Sir Albert
Dunstan when Victorian Premier had
dubbed the Victorian Legislative Council
“an inverted Micawber, waiting for some-
thing to turn down” reminds me that
when, as his publicity-man, 1 helped him
prepare a speech to be delivered at
Donald, he was being kept in office by
Labor and had to make a show of re-
forming the Upper House, which had
been mucking his bills about. Before he
mounted the platform I recalled reading
the phrase somevyhere, and urged him to
apply it to the Council. He was shy of
literary references, but he did so. I
thought at the time it had been coined by
an American journalist about the House
of’ Lords, but learned later that it was
Philip Guedalla's description of (I think)
a retired admiral who, during the 1914
War, headed an inventions-board ip
London, but wanted no new-fangled
ideas as to how the war was to be won.

“8.A.K.”: Sydney’s first twilight race-

race game always goes: when you get a
good tip it’s always too late.

“Sackville”: A further ripple from the
Rodney disaster (Service Page, 7/1 / ’59).
The vessel had been booked to take a
party of supervisors and various
executive - employees of the Goodyear
Rubber Co. for a picnic-cruise on the
date of the tragedy. At short notice the
Rodney’s connections cancelled the book-
ing in favor of a harbor-cruise farewelling
the departing American ships. The pic-
pickers, left in the lurch, decidedly angry,
determined to sue for breach of contract.
With the news of the tragedy, however,
it was decided to drop the case, the craft’s
owners being in enough trouble without

“Uncle Joe”: I can go a little further
back than “Central” (B. 12/11/ ’5B), to
about 1895, when I was the office cat

a week). We used to get Is. 6d. for tea-
money when working back, and for 9d.
Walker’s in Park Street would provide
us with a full three-course meal. A few
years earlier, when Quong Tart opened
the first tea-shop in Sydney, a good cuppa

■ “N. S. Wales Health Department will in
future approve single-chambered septic-tanks
instead of double-chamber tanks, which cost
about twice as much.”
The pressure of the world’s affairs
Is unifying social ranks
In homes as small as seven squares —
But now — one-chambered septic tanks!
You’d think the system that ensures
Democracy for one and all
Would still be mirrored in our sewers
Conserving them bicameral;
But no! The hand of time moves on,
Inexorably pulls the chain —
And all our spacious days have gone
For ever, down the narrowing drain.

“It looks silly, Dolores, because horses'-tails are

A s Canberra recovers from the annual
citizenship conference one wonders
if the average Australian, with pre-
conceived ideas about the new citizen
from Europe, is disappointed by devia-
tion. As I bear the name of a husband
from Europe I am often complimented
on the way I have picked -up
English. My husband is prepared to fit
into this Australian picture, and with
straight face asks for ‘wellingtons” in-
stead of “lamingtons,” “silverfish” in-
stead of “silverside,” and solemnly
exhorts the guest who drinks too slowly
“not to pull the chain” (for “not to drag
the chain”). But European omission of
the article does lead to misunderstanding.
We know a man who dearly loves an
argument, generally rounding-off a dis-
cussion with a dogmatic: “Well, Dick
Shinnery says. . .” When his wife was
planning a Christmas - party she added
Dick’s name to the guest-list, as she
wished to include as many of her
husband’s friends as her own. When she
tried to elicit Dick’s address from her
husband he denied knowledge of a Mr.
Shinnery. In the end the frustrated wife
was shouting “Dick Shinnery! Dick
Shinnery!” He solved the problem by
producing the dictionary.—“N.A.Z.”

“Slip-point”: A few
years ago the cricket-
commentators’ word
was “ovation.” Every
darned thing got an
ovation, and often in
the wrong place. “Ova-
tion” gave way to
“h ost i 1 e.” Bowling,
batting, fielding was or
was not hostile. I
lived in hope of some-
one getting a hostile
ovation . . . Then “con-
centration” crept in
and surged forward.
Different players at
varied times lost their
concentration. I sup-
pose it meant some-
thing. It was applied to
everything. It’s still
going strong, though an
outsider is creeping up
and seems likely to take
its place: “penetra-
tion.” Batting, bowl-
ing and fielding, all at
sundry times lack pene-
tration. I wonder what
sort of a hostile ova-
tion a man would get
if, by lack of concentration, he failed to
penetrate?

“Tabba”: The experiences of two
friends have proved to me the wisdom of
calling for quotations before having work

related by marriage, who said he’d do the
job: “Don’t worry, I’ll keep the price
right.” He did: friend got a bill for
£339, and is going to court with an offer
to pay half. Friend 2 wanted a hot-
water system installed using the slow-
combustion stove in the kitchen. He
thought he couldn’t go wrong by con-
sulting one of the district’s old-estab-
lished firms . . . The bill for £320 made
him roar so loudly that the old-estab-
fished firm promptly knocked off £2O.
Not satisfied, he visited the manufac-
turer, and another £3O was saved. How
are these jobs costed if such sums can
be lopped?

Johnnie Ray has just ceased to be a

of course, exceptions. Howard Berry

therefore, a bitter rival ; and Howard’s

we’d be sending a truck-load to the tip

Efficient at housewifely duty,
Extravagant, thrifty—this cutie
Who’a wed once again, gives no clue.
Nought concerning her age she divulges,
Nor if she is skinny, or bulges.
She just stresses this : she effulges —
A good point, to give her her due.
Doubts she seems to dismiss
Touching on the “man who
Leads her up to the altar.
But she stipulates this :
He’ll have not hitherto
Donned the marital halter.
Why the ban ? Is the lady too fearful
An ex-married’s had such an earful
Of yap he’d be rendered uncheerful,
And, therefore, no fit mate for her?
That too many ropes he’d be knowing?
His Number One's virtues be blowing
Regarding her cooking and sewing ?
Those items are prickly as burr!

Come, bachies., apply
For this paragon. Who’ll let
Opportunity pass?
Give your number a fly
On the conjugal roulette!

A LETTER FROM A YANK—
Fulbright Exchangee
The Kelton S. McDonald
family, most recently of
Gilgandra, N.S.W., are
proving quite imper-
vious to our town’s rugged
winter. Of a solid month of
freezing temperatures here in
Springfield, Pennsylvania, Kel-
ton said: “We’ve hardly paid
it any attention —we’ve been
having so much fun.” Teach-
ing three daily classes of
world geography and two of
English is his workaday fun ;
taking part in our suburban
community and life, and hav-
ing a good look at America is,
we should judge, the rest of
it.
Sharing the experience are
Mrs. Roma (Christie) Mc-
Donald, also Graham, aged 5,
Anne (3), and Helen (8
months). Mrs. McDonald is
busy in their duplex dwelling,
a five-minute walk from
Springfield’s combined junior/
senior high-school. Never-
theless, she can get about quite
freely, as “baby-sitting” for
Australians is deemed a
privilege in this part of the
world ; local schoolgirls com-
pete for the honor —on a
purely voluntary basis.
Mrs. McDonald, too, has
found an Australian Women’s
Club in the Greater Philadel-
phia area. Meanwhile,
Graham, although under-age by
our standards, has been quali-
fied and enrolled in a first-
grade class just a toddler from
home. And Anne is well
embarked in a private kinder-
garten.
Kelton McDonald is one of
eight Australian public-school
teachers currently scattered
about the U.S.A. under the
Fulbright exchange pro-
gramme. They are part of a
force of approximately 60
representatives from Down
Under so engaged this year in
various missions of culture and
study.
The local “turnabout” thus
dispatched William A. Camp-
bell and family from Ameri-
can shores in reciprocation.
At the option of Australian
authorities, Mr. Campbell was
not sent to fill the niche
vacated by McDonald at Gil-
gandra. Instead, he was
assigned to Homebush high-
school near Sydney, as a more
comparable situation. Thence,
after a half-year term, he was
to have moved on for another
half-year at Grafton (N.S.W.)
high-school. The Campbells,
according to McDonald’s
information, added a baby boy
to Sydney’s transient popula-
tion not long after the family’s
arrival.
Tt’s a pleasure to report a
-*■ steady growth in friendliness
and respect for the young Aus-
tralian teacher and his family
since they came, by Qantas to
San Francisco and cross-
country by train, last mid-
August. In a word, they now
“belong.”
In fact, there was some

difficulty overtaking the
McDonalds for purposes of a
reasonably up-to-date inter-
view. They were out of town
for an eight-day, 2000-mile
tour to Florida during the
year-end holidays. On their
return we were hard-pressed
to locate them, and particu-
larly Kelton, between his
school duties, a basketball
game, Philadelphia’s famous
Mummers’ Parade, a com-
munity concert of Gaelic
music and dancing, and some
scholastic wrestling-matches.
TiyHEN finally cornered late
one afternoon in his class-
room, Kelton gave a commen-
tary on his impressions thus
far. Capsuled, they are:
The school: “Magnificent,
by Australian standards.” He
noted that such physical
appointments as the huge audi-
torium, the several gymna-
siums and libraries, well-
equipped laboratories and
teaching-aids were quite in
line with the fact that 80 p.c.
of Springfield’s secondary
students are preparing for
college.
The youngster s: “The
remarkable thing, to me, is
that they are not different, but
ever so much like Aussie
youngsters in attitudes and
interests. Take away the
accents, and they’re all alike —
just kids.”
Parents: “They appear to
take a much more intimate
interest in what teachers and
students are doing, no doubt
because boards of tax-paying
citizens give close direction to
school administration.
Thousands of parents turned
out for ‘Home and School
Night,’ doubtless to see how
their dollars were being spent.”
Volunteer fire- and ambu-
lance-corps : “In a town of
this size (25,000), Australia
would have a fairly large, full-
time force. Springfield seems
to do quite well with very
few regulars and a large squad
of volunteers who come run-
ning from all directions when
the alarm sounds.”
Police efficiency: “Indeed
they have it. They tagged and
fined me a dollar for overnight
street-parking my 1954 Chev-
rolet very shortly after we
took up residence.”
Humorous incident: “In
company with other teachers,
I was visiting a nearby West-
inghouse plant where, as it
happened, they were making
some type of nuclear
mechanisms. In all innocence,
1 had a camera slung over my
neck, which, apparently, our
guides didn’t notice. Thus
when I suddenly asked per-
mission to take a shot the
officials went into a complete
flap, hauled me to the guard-
room the instant they heard
A ustralian schoolteacher

American class.
my ‘foreign' accent, and finally
turned me loose, intact, after
quite a conference. End result
—apologies all around and no
hard feelings.”
The McDonalds are booked
for passage home, sailing Sep-
tember 7, on the Orsova.
The school-year ends in June.
There will be plenty of
time yet to see more
of the eastern seaboard
while in this vicinity. They
plan a grand tour on their way
westward the Rocky
Mountains, the deserts, the
Grand Canyon and the
national parks, plus a good
sweep of the Pacific Coast,
not forgetting Disneyland.
Kelton McDonald, a gradu-
ate of Sydney University, class
of ’49, is the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Allen S. McDonald, of
the Sydney suburb of Croydon.
Mrs. McDonald is the daughter
of Mr. Gordon Christie, of
Gilgandra.

POLITICAL POINTS
N.S.W. Premier Cahill, 68 last week,
has held the Premiership longer than
any of his Labor predecessors —six years
and 10 months. He is still 4\ months
short of U.A.P. Premier Stevens’s record.
That’s not very long, but he’ll have to

The mystery of the Sydney City Coun-

system has now been cleared-up. Wards
will be reintroduced either before the
State election or after it, unless, of course,
it is decided not to reintroduce them
at all.
Similarly, the City Council elections
will either be held next December, as
scheduled, or postponed for a year, as
rumored.

C-series index-figures released by the
Commonwealth Statistician on Friday
showed an increase in living-costs in
every State except Westralia. In terms
of the Federal basic-wage (though it is
not now governed by the index) the rise
would have been: Sydney, 25.; Mel-
bourne, Brisbane and Hobart, 45.;
Adelaide, 35.; Perth, no change.
In N.S.W. the State basic-wage will
automatically rise 2s. to £l3 155., the
highest figure yet. Although the N.S.W.
wage has bobbed up and down like a
yo-yo in the past three years, the net
increase since December, 1956, is only
one shilling.

him party work in certain electorates,
bitterly criticised the executive for its
treatment of him after he had “at the
request of the leaders of the party” and
against specialist’s advice left hospital to
go to Canberra “at the risk of my life”
to vote on the banking bills. Grant com-
plained that he had received no word of
thanks for this action, and that no inquiry
had been since made as to his state of
health. He further complained that Dr.
Evatt had assisted Senator Ormonde in
his campaigning for Senate preselection ;
Grant himself lost the A.L.P. endorse-
ment after 16 years in the Senate and will
retire on June 30.
Silent when Cyril Chambers, H. V.
Johnson, C. Morgan and others were
criticising Evatt, Donald now forecasts
the “continual decline and eventual dis-
integration” of the A.L.P. unless it is
drastically and completely reorganised.

Very shortly there’ll be no need for
anyone to call, “Time, gents., please,” in
Parliament House —by the opening of
Parliament next month Time will stare
at you from almost every corner of
the Canberra edifice. Workmen
are working overtime at weekends to
complete the installation of 400 new
clocks ; there’ll be one in every room —
some have two already—and others will
be spaced at intervals along the lobbies
and corridors. Together with the clocks
will be 400 division-bells and 400 sets
of division-lights—red for the Senate,
green for the Reps.
The clocks, which were specially
designed by the Parliamentary engineers,
are to be connected to a master-clock at
Mt. Stromlo Observatory and will correct
themselves every hour on the hour. No
indication of the cost of the scheme has
been given, as tenders were not called for,
nor let and published, in the Government
“Gazette.”

Mrs. Wilfred Steele, by. winning the
L.C.L. preselection ballot for the Burn-
side seat in the S.A. Assembly, becomes
almost certain of winning that safe
Liberal seat. In the ballot she defeated
sitting member Geoffrey Clarke, who has
represented Burnside since 1947 and is at
present Government Whip. A third
candidate in the ballot was R. W. John-
son, Mayor of Campbelltown.
Last month Mrs. Geoffrey Cooper was
endorsed as L.C.L. candidate for Central
District No. 2 in the S.A. Legislative
Council, also considered a safe Lib. seat,
so the next S.A. Parliament looks like
having, for the first time, a woman mem-
ber in each House. It’s a prospect that
would have gladdened the hearts of
Catherine Helen Spence and Jeanne
Young, pioneer advocates of women’s
rights in South Australia.

As forecast in The Bulletin some
months back, possible devaluation of the
Australian £ has become a topic in the
market-places and in the press. The idea
behind such suggestions is to try to offset
the drop in our export income by in-
creasing the number of Australian pounds
received in exchange for the reduced
number of dollars, sterling pounds, etc.,
our wool, metals, dairy products, and
so on, are fetching in the world’s markets.
Devaluation is inflationary inasmuch as
it immediately raises the cost of imports.
Furthermore, it is better, for a start,
to reduce internal production-costs than
to try to disguise our productivity
deficiencies by expedients which can
only have temporary value. It would be
spunder, in any case, for the U.S. to raise
the price of gold than for Australia to
take any separate action.

A. P. Herbert, standing as an Inde-
pendent in the East Harrow by-election,
is paying his campaign expenses by
charging Is, a copy for his election-
manifesto ; bound and autographed
copies, £1 Is. No doubt he’ll cover his
expenses, too, and possibly show a profit,
but it isn’t an example many candidates
could successfully follow. The average
Independent would get better results by
offering a bob to everyone who would

Thriller-writers were beaten by fact
when the Scandinavian airliner taking
Mikoyan back to Moscow from his
American visit struck engine-trouble and

ing at a secret U.S. base in Newfound-

Mik. didn’t learn much there, but it
can also be taken for granted that before

Tantalised by his inability to control
the Legislative Council, Victorian Premier
Bolte is speaking again of measures to
make it more responsive to the people’s
wishes. His Liberals are one short of a
majority in the Upper House. The
Country party refuses to supply a presi-
dent, and can, by joining hands with
Labor, frustrate legislation from the
Lower House.
K. H. Turnbull, Bolte’s Minister for
Lands, has gone further than his leader
by declaring that the Upper House has
“outlived its usefulness.” (Its usefulness
is never apparent to a party without an
Upper House majority.)
Now into the shadow-sparring ring
steps Clive Stoneham, leader of the Labor
Opposition, with an announcement,
challenging Bolte, that Labor may bring-
down a private-member’s bill to abolish
the Upper House—“the only effective
reform.” Bolte retorts that nobody will
take Stoneham seriously and that Labor,
when it controlled the Assembly and
almost controlled the Council, did
nothing about abolition.
Stoneham, as a student of natural
history, also probably knows well enough
the ways of political nature —that nobody
outside the Upper House really wants it,
but that nobody with the power to
abolish it will do anything, just in case
it comes in useful again to block the
other fellow.

Asked at a press-conference whether
he had directed Government departments

preference to other brands in order to
-help the M.P.C. company out of its
financial difficulties, N.S.W. Premier
Cahill said he had asked Government
departments and authorities to give that
co. a “fair quota of their cement orders”;
he had not directed the exclusive use of
its product or urged undue preference
to it.
Has he asked the N.S.W. Rural Bank

Melbourne is even further than Sydney
from getting a new opera-house ; there’s
only a plaque to mark the intended site
of what may distantly become its new
art-gallery and cultural centre. But the
music-bowl, superbly located in the
Domain, is—thanks to the Sidney Myer
trust —a reality. The distant impression
of its shining aluminium canopy is, from
the city side, a bit put of tune with all
the surrounding greenery, but the
organisers promise that it will be
thoroughly efficient, what with 24 loud-
speakers and an electronic sound-delay-
ing device to prevent echoes in ampli-
fication.
The job cost £200,000, there will be
2000 invited guests —and probably 18,000
other onlookers —on the lawns for the
official opening on February 12. Kenneth
Myer will hand over the bowl to the
people, personified by Lord Mayor
Thomas ; Prime Minister Menzies will
declare it open ; and then Alfred Wallen-
stein, of the Hollywood Bowl, will lead
150 musicians of the combined Sydney

the first programme. The Domain will
never look the same again ; on the other
hand, the bowl will lift park-music out of

The obituary of Charles
Treasure (B. 31/12/’5B) does not do him
full justice.
C. W. Treasure, of the Greenfields Stud,
Cannington (W.A.), came to Westralia in 1908
at the age of 22 in charge of five Shorthorn
bulls consigned to Anna Plains station in the
Kimberleys, 130 miles from Broome. His
instructions were to deliver them personally.
He knew nothing of Australia, let alone the
Kimberleys, but he transhipped the bulls at
Fremantle to the old Charon, unloaded them
at Broome, and led them by the hand, walking
all the 130 miles, and delivered them personally,
according to his instructions, to Anna Plains
in good order and condition. Anyone who has
tried to lead one bull 10 miles will admit that
as a feat that takes some beating. He was
rewarded with a job at Anna Plains, where he
stayed for three years.
Treasure then went to the Narrogin Agri-
cultural College and afterwards worked for
the late William Padbury, at the time the most
successful exhibitor of stud-stock at the
Perth Royal. Later, Treasure bought the
property at Cannington (on the Albany High-
way, about half-way to Armadale) and began
breeding Friesians. He had a long association
with the breed and with the Canning Agri-
cultural Society, of which he was a member for
44 years as well as president for eight years.
He won the Governor’s Cup at the Royal Show
in 1946.
His eldest son, R. E. Treasure, continued the
association with Anna Plains when he started
the overland road-train-lift, which takes several
thousand cattle from Anna Plains to Meeka-
tharra for railing to Perth every year.

ABORIGINALITIES
T* eading of “Old Charlie Ice-cream”
(B. 7/1/’59) and his curry-powder
revives in me a doubt if good curry can
derive from powder. In a sealed con-
tainer just the brief necessary openings
seem to result in all the ingredients
losing their flavor - strength except the
ginger, which unharmoniously dominates
the composition even if it does not
paralyse your taste-buds.
Ah Hing would return to my Borneo
bungalow from market at 7 a.m. In
a mortar he first pestled tumeric, next
coriander, blending the two with coconut-
milk ; then likewise chilli and ginger.
Only then were the four ingredients
finally mingled in a paste.
At this stage he told his Hakka-woman
assistant he would wield the meat-chopper
on her if she didn’t hurry browning the
onions. The fluid of two coconuts was
then added to the curry-paste, and
whether it was to be curry of oysters,
chicken, prawns or aubergines, it was
on cooking before he dished-out break-
fast at 9 a.m., and all the bustle was to
ensure that the curry was good and ready
by 1 p.m.
It was always darkly-green and never
burnt the tongue, but the first spoonful
“Sorry We're late—his ship sank!”
started the scalp perspiring freely. Ladled
over a full soup-plate of rice, it assured
repletion and induced a nice siesta, from
which you awoke at 4 p.m. ravenous for
afternoon-tea.
The Asian may dream of houris, the
Australian of winning Tatt.’s ; but old-
timers from Malaya dream of curries.

E. V. Stevens: May I add a few words
to the Service Page instructions for
cooking dampers (B. 10/12/’58)? I’ve
cooked hundreds of ’em ; we used ’carb.-
soda, cream-of-tartar or tartaric-acid and
a pinch of salt. Our baking-board was
a strip -of canvas about lift. long. The
main factor was the fire ; if there are
any live coals in this the damper will
either be burned or will cook unevenly.
Ashes from gidgee (gydia), boree, myall
and a very few other trees were like
flour, retaining heat for a long time. I’ve
seen gidgee ashes so hot they ran like
quicksilver. But any live coals —not on
your life! The only time live coals were
used was when a quick meal was needed
and there wasn’t enough tirne to burn
wood to make ashes. In this case you
made a small, thin dough and cooked it
right on the coals, not covering it. It
was a tough and rather overburnt meal.

“Gravelsnatcher”: Identifying a bird
from someone else’s description is
chancy, but assuming that “Wippegong’s”
identification of “D.A.’s” bird as a reed-
warbler is correct (B. 10/12/’5B), it
raises some questions for Westralian
naturalists. Over here this bird may be
migratory to some extent —it seems to
leave the extreme south-west for the
winter —but on my swamp near Perth I
can count on finding some among the
reeds and tea-trees, or in the bamboo
thickets a little way back from the water,
at any time of the year. I can’t recall
ever having seen one of them more than
200yds. from a reedy area, and I’ve
certainly never heard one sing away from
its nesting-area or at any time apart
from the nesting-season. They start-up
in October and carry through until the
end of January, when their last brood
usually takes wing. I’m speaking of their
beautiful, ringing mating and territorial
song. All you’ll get out of them any
other time of the year is a mild twitter,
and I’d like to know if the eastern-States
members of the species sing to any extent
away from the nesting-site.
“Shamuseen”: I first gave credence to
stories about fish falling with rain when
I saw a fleece displayed some years ago
in a show-window in Queen Street, Bris-
bane. Embedded in it were the sun-
and-wind-dried carcasses of two small
fish of the perch family. They were
discovered when the jumbuck was being
shorn on Wittenburra station in the Eulo
district of far s.-w. Queensland. They
were the kind of fish found normally in
rivers, creeks, dams and other rain-filled
depressions, and not of the kind found
in the mineral-laden water in artesian
bore-drains ; and sheep are not given to
wallowing in- dams, rivers or creeks. A
shower of rain had fallen about a week
before the jumbuck was shorn.

“Cleat”: “Tackee” (B. 10/12/’5B),
writing of finding a petrified sawn blood-
wood block in a tributary creek of the
Burragorang Valley (N.S.W.), was ex-
pecting too much of the slow process of

THE OLD TASMANIAN FARMER
Come here, I'll tell you how we came
by dray
Across the rainy hills one day
And could not see the sun when we
awoke,
In June, the year the Bank went broke ;
It’s fifty years they say. Good God, it
seems
That now my days are drenched in
dreams —
Three Harvest Homes ago at most that we
Found that black in a hollow tree.
The old hands chased and shot them
down like dogs
And searched by poking sticks in logs
As on that sweating day we did the same,
In prodding bones without a name ;
Around his ribs the blackberries ripely
grew,
O green as spring they twisted through
His spiderweb-hung eyes and probed his
bones
Within a silence bare as stones
Where standing on his hawk-high midday
hill
He looked down where Bass Strait crept
still
Along the sun-flicked sand towards the
east
Before the Forties, golden-fleeced.
We set the stump on fire and gathered
wood.
We rolled logs round him where he stood,
The ring-barked bush became his burying-
g round,
Our barking dogs the only sound.

quoted by nearly 200-million years. The
squared smooth surfaces would be due
to the influence of bedding and jointing,
the latter induced by post-depositional
shearing of the stratum and of the tree-
trunk within it. There are a number of
similar fossil-wood specimen occurrences
in the lower part of the coal measures
in both the southern and south-western
coalfields.
“Archaen”: Petrification is the replace-
ment of the original tissue in vegetable-
or animal-matter by silica, often retain-
ing all the details of grain-structure, etc.
Under some circumstances, it can occur
very rapidly. Nearly 50 years ago the
breakwater at Outer Harbor, Port
Adelaide, was built of newly - quarried
granite. Within a few months, people
who had gone there to fish from it were
bringing home apples and pears as hard
as road-metal. The fruit had been
dumped from ships and had drifted
among the lumps of granite, where
silica, dissolved from the rock, had re-
placed the original tissue of the fruit as
it decayed. One particular specimen re-
tained the original red color of the skin,
but was as hard and as heavy as a lump
of flint—which in fact it was.

“Jeyles": Spouse with eyeache was
told by doctor she had conjunctivitis and
to use Blank's eye ointment (one tin
3s. 9d.). Next day she took cocker with
grass-seed in ear to vet., who diagnosed
pooch as also having conjunctivitis and
prescribed one bottle (17s. 6d.). Both
patients made a good recovery.

“Spin": Tell “Andee” not to rely on
the assumption that a sea-snake isn't
dangerous because it has comparatively
small fangs (B. 26/11 /’5B). There are
more than a score of species in Austra-
lian waters, and the toxicity naturally
varies, just as it does amongst land
species ; but in most cases the venom
is extremely toxic, because it has to inflict
almost instant paralysis on a slippery
victim in a fluid medium. What poison
doesn't enter the wound immediately is
washed off, yet the number of successful
strikes is sufficient to maintain a con-
siderable population in the waters around
New Guinea. There you'll
sometimes see them curled up,
sunning themselves on the sur-
face, head to the inside of the
coil ; alarmed, they unwind,
head-first, straight down. A
native warned me they're
about the most dangerous
thing in the ocean.

‘‘Miss M.": But surely there
are four Australian species of
black cockatoos? The white-
tailed bloke ( ccilyptorhynchus
banditti) is . confined, as
“Kelms” says (B. 12 /11/ ’5B),
to the south-west corner of
W.A. His red-tailed relatives
(C. banksi ) have a much wider
range, having been sighted
over most of the mainland.
The glossy black cockatoo (C.
lathami) also has a red tail,
but his range is more limited
and does not seem to extend to
W.A. The yellow-tailed fellow (C.
funereus ) also stays well to the east of
the W.A. border, though he turns-up in
Tasmania. The eastern-Staters are great
wanderers, at times roaming hundreds of
miles from the mountains and forests
which are their most favored homes. In
the arid interior their rare visits are
hailed as sure signs of rain. As weather-
prophets they are probably no less
reliable than ibis, channel-billed cuckoos,
cats, frogs and your rheumatics.

“J.J.A.”: Have always accepted as a
truism that black-and-white birds chase
anything on principle ; then I saw a wag-
tail, cursing horribly, being pursued by
two linnets whose command of invective
was equal to Willie’s own. Now, what
had the cheeky little bloke been up to?

IyiusHROOMS (B. 24/12/’5B) lift masses
of asphalt, concrete, etc., by cell-
division. The body of the fungus is
composed of millions of cells, and it
grows because each of these split into
two. The halves grow to full size, split
in their turn and so on. The cumulative
effect of millions of tiny thrusts is a very
powerful expansive force. The same
thing enables tree-roots to force big rocks
apart, crack-open the joints of earthen-
ware pipes, and so forth.
A parallel case is the swelling of wood
when wet. As each cell takes-up water
it expands in size, and the millions of
cells together become a powerful pressure.
It is so great, in fact, that the ancient
Egyptians were able to split-off 100-ton
blocks of granite by cutting a groove to
guide the fracture, then hammering soft-
wood wedges into it. When boiling water
was poured on the wedges, they swelled
and the huge mass of rock split. Valuable
marble is still quarried in this way ; it
breaks it away in sound blocks, with none
of the waste which would occur if ex-
plosives were used.
An interesting experiment can be made
by putting a small, strong ink-bottle over
“I leave these sticking-out. from under the car
while I whip-up to the local for a pint”
a baby mushroom. As it grows it fills
the bottle, and then the pressure makes
the bottle burst. The fungus which did
the job will be found to be as dense as
rubber and even harder, but can still be
cooked and eaten.
ARCHAEN.


Time Means Tucker
By H. P. (“DUKE”) TRITTON
Illustrations chiefly from contemporary issues of The Bulletin.
Both of them 19-year-olds, the writer and his mate Dutchy have set out from
Sydney in 1905 on a breezily adventurous wander about the N.S.W. outback,
learning to become shearers, doing fencing contracts and having a go at gold-
digging, singing and taking the hat round in the towns, boxing in show-booths,
meeting picturesque characters, and generally getting to know the bush and bush
folk, and taking life as they find it. They have gone by boat to Newcastle, headed
west from there, jumped the rattler when convenient, tramped from station to
station for shearing, travelled about the country with Ruenalf’s boxing-show (and
got into other fights), tried gold-digging at Gulgong, and a bit of emu-bobbing,
and are now in the Warrumbungle country.
AS we intended to have
a go at the rabbits we
left Wingadee and made
for Gumin. It was near
the end of April, and skin
prices were rising fast.
On the way we called in at
Calga, and signed-up for pens
for the shearing. We had met
Mr. Woodward, of Mount
Tenandra, and he had signed
us up, also recommending us
to the manager of Calga. At
Gumin we clicked again, and
reckoned we were on top of
the world, with three sheds,
each of 2000 per man, and
all adjoining. These are the
runs shearers dream of.
Owned by Willoughby
Dowling and managed by
Edward O’Connor, Gumin
took in half the Warrum-
bungle Range, and had a lot of
flat country besides. About
40,000 sheep, but all the
mountain country ran cattle and
horses. Sheep in the hills had
to be shepherded, owing to
the dingoes. The horses were
bred specially for the Indian
Army. Known as “walers,”
they were a cross, with blood
sires and coach or hackney
mares. Probably the hardiest
horses in the world, they were
in great demand as Army
remounts.
Breaking-in time was a show
on its own. One man would
usually take-on the contract,
and bring three or four buck-
jump-riders. Many famous
ones had broken-in horses on
Gumin ; Lance Skuthorpe,
Harry Morant, “Sydney Bob”
Brewster and Billy Waite are
a few names that come to
mind. “Sydney Bob” had been
doing the job for a good many
years, and was there in my
time. He would be well into his
sixties, and did no riding him-
self. He did the handling and
had two good riders to do
the roughing.
The Indian buyers would
come to Gumin whenever there
were sufficient horses available,
and would buy about 500
horses every year, which is a
lot of horses when you see
them in one mob.
'IIS7E started on the rabbits
* * with quince-jam and
strychnine, and knocked-over
200 or 300 a night, but
reckoned this wasn’t good
enough, considering the bunnies
were so plentiful. We thought
it would be a good idea to
experiment. While at Tongy
with Tom Hennesy the pre-
vious year Dutchy had noticed
the rabbits had been doing a
lot of scratching round the base
of the ordinary black-thistles,
and he thought it would be
worth while trying one night’s
set.
We dug up about 71b. of
nice crisp roots, cut them into
cubes half-an-inch long,
mixed powdered strychnine
through them, then laid our
trail in the usual way. The
results amazed us. We had
laid out 1000 baits and picked
up over 800 rabbits within 20ft.
of the trail. The same hap-
pened the next night.
This idea caught-on and
spread rapidly. Rabbiters
came to see our method, and,
as there was no chance of
keeping it secret, we told them
all we knew. I wouldn’t know
if Dutchy and I were the first
to use thistles, but we must
have been close. We had heard
of apples, carrots and turnips
being used, but never thistles.
About the middle of June,
rabbit-skin prices dropped, so
we went after possums, wal-
labies and kangaroos. The
fact that full protection had
recently been placed on
possums did not worry us
unduly, though a fine of £1
per skin was. the penalty.
We had one very narrow
escape, when Sergeant
Menarey, of Barradine, with
his tracker, made a surprise-
visit to our camp. After search-
ing through our scant posses-
sions they rode in a circle round
the camp, examining hollow
trees and logs. I held my
breath a couple of times, but
they missed our plant.
Returning to his camp,
Menarey said: “I've missed
this time, but I know you have
skins planted somewhere, and
make no mistake, I'll get you
sooner or later.” He then
rode off. The tracker lingered
a moment, screwed his face
up in an exaggerated wink,
wheeled his horse and followed
the sergeant. Dutchy turned
to me and said: “That tracker
must have seen something, but
he's on our side.”
)
Vl/’E stuck to kangaroos for a
few days. We visited our
plant, which was a huge box-
tree with a hollow big enough
for a man to get into with
no trouble, and room to stack
a thousand possum-skins.
Twenty-feet from the entrance
were the tracks of the tracker's
horse, and alongside them
several perfect sets of foot-
prints. No tracker worthy of
the name could have missed the
plant. Peace to his bones.
We had over 500 possum-
skins in that tree. Menarey's
visit had taught us a lesson:
When possum-poaching never
have your skins in the one
place. Always have several
plants ; then, if you are copped
for one lot, you have plenty of
skins to pay the fine.
The farcical part of the pro-
tection was that the wool-and-
skin stores were handling
possum-skins, and the news-
papers were quoting prices. The
law stated that any person in
possession of possum-skins
would be prosecuted, yet the
railways accepted them as
freight, the local buyers bought

DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
Touring May of last year the
news was broken in Sydney
that Development Finance
Corporation, Ltd., with big
overseas financial names behind
it, had become owner of the
controlling-interest in Aus-
tralian Fixed Trusts Pty., Ltd.
(in which the name of share-
brokers Patrick and Company
had a short time previously
become associated), and part-
owner of the former Bank of
N.S.W. building at 16
O’Connell Street, Sydney.
Among the large overseas
backers were Lehman Brothers
(a New York investment-
banking partnership interested
in managing U.S. unit-trusts),
Prudential Assurance, Pearl
Assurance, Eagle Star Insur-
ance, R.othschilds and Philip
Hill, Higginson and Co., all of
the U K.
Australian investors in
D.F.C. include Patrick Nomi-
nees Pty., Mercantile Mutual
Insurance, Washington H. Soul,
Pattinson and Co., and a
number of others. L. J.
Hooker Investment Corp. is
associated with D.F.C. in
Realty Development and
Mortgage Discount Co., Ltd.
In May, 1958, it was stated
that the majority of D.F.C.
shares would be held in Aus-
tralia.
In its first report as a public
co., D.F.C. says that it is
primarily interested in assist-
ing Australia’s industrial de-
velopment, “and whilst a flex-
ible policy will be maintained,
its principal objectives are”:
(а) The provision of capital by
negotiation with local and overseas
associations.
(б) Development and negotiation
which embraces drawing attention
to opportunities for profitable
investment of overseas capital in
Australia, and bringing into local
association overseas and Australian
companies to advance basic indus-
trial development and production
techniques in this country.
(c) Agency services for overseas
principals in the form of market-
surveys and research.
( d) Financial advisory services
and investment-portfolio manage-
ment and administration of a group
of unit-trusts.
“To assist in carrying-out the
above objectives a basis of
mutual understanding has been
established with banking insti-
“ Where is it?”
tutions in U.K., U.S.A.,
Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Belgium, Switzerland
and Holland, and this relation-
ship has been consolidated by
these overseas banking institu-
tions subscribing for shares in
ffte capital of the co. Similar
associations are now being dis-
cussed.”
Since balance-date (June 30,
1958, when paid capital was
£721,500 in shares of £1 each)
further capital has been allotted
“to selected financial institu-
tions whose participation
should assist the co.’s further
development,” and paid-up
capital on December 18, 1958,
was £950,000, “in the main
subscribed by institutions and
investment-companies.” The
company’s capitalisation “has
virtually been_completed,” the
annual report says.
Early this year there was talk
that the co. would very likely
be one of the operators in a
new short-term money-market
expected to be set-up in Aus-
tralia during 1959. The Aus-
tralian United (Potter) group" in
Melbourne was mentioned as
another probable participant.
It is disclosed that the
O’Connell-street premises were
bought by Delfin Properties
Pty., Ltd., a co. jointly owned
by Eagle Star Insurance and
D.F.C. The Australian Fixed
Trusts group is primarily con-
trolled by Unit Investments,
Ltd., most of the shares in
which appear to be controlled
in turn by D.F.C.
In acquiring control of
Unit Investments, Ltd., and
other companies, D.F.C. paid
£267,780 more than par-value,
after deducting pre-acquisition
profits. Minority shareholders
at June 30 accounted for only
£13,019, so that “takeovers”
appear to have been almost
complete.
D.F.C. does not list its sub-
sidiaries, but its annual report
gives the following grouped
balance-sheet figures:

in the holding-co.’s accounts as
“shares in other cos.,” and in
the consolidated figures are
said to be “at cost or under,

In the holding-co.’s accounts
shares in subsidiaries are
shown at £602,960, with the net
amount owing by subsidiaries
£67,752, and “shares in other

the final “investments” figure
£671,686.

D.F.C. and its subsidiaries, in-
cluding, apparently, profits
from Stock Exchange dealings,
after providing £25,418 for
depreciation, £107,594 for taxa-
tion, and directors’ fees £14,812
(including subsidiaries), was
£160,353, less £11,680 belong-
ing to minority shareholders,
or £148,673 as D.F.C.’s propor-
tion. Out of this, £18,535 of
goodwill and preliminary exes,
were written-off.
No dividend is recommended
at this stage, but future divi-
dends are to be considered.
Net profit of D.F.C. alone
(included in the foregoing con-
solidated profit) was £75,321.

profit from sharemarket trading
and earnings received from
unit-trust operations but
it clearly has had a good year,
net profit, after a tax provi-
sion that seems relatively high
(and “after making adequate
provision against possible
market fluctuations of trading
stocks”), representing 20.6
p.c. flat on paid capital as it
stood at the end of the financial
term.
The past term, incidentally,
was D.F.C.’s fifth year of
existence, but its first as a
public co. with big associations.
Nearly seven months have
passed since the close of the
last accounts. Unit-trust activi-
ties have been expanding
(though more competitors are
now in the field), and the share-
market has been favorable to
buyers of most Stock Exchange
securities. The board’s assur-
ance that the co. “has now
reached a stage in its develop-
ment where rewards to its
shareholders by way of divi-
dend will receive early con-
sideration” seems justified. The
immediate outlook for share-
market trading in industrial
equities is complex and
■ obscure, but long-term pros-
pects appear very encouraging.
The problems of the invest-
ment outlook seem to be truly
appreciated at the unit-trust
end of the business where
recently there has been more
emphasis on investment in
fixed-interest securities.
Directors of D.F.C. are
J. H. D. Marks (chairman and
managing - director), J. W.

Dollar Travel Allowance
Tn explaining Australia’s
A reaction to the new Euro-
pean currency moves, with
particular reference to the con-
vertibility of sterling held by
residents in non - sterling
countries, Commonwealth
Treasurer Harold Holt men-
tioned a change in the avail-
ability of “hard” currency to
Australians touring overseas.
The present basic travel-
allocation of £l3OO sterling per
person in any period* of 12
months will be unchanged.
However, the present provi-
sions under which a traveller
can use up to £6OO sterling of
his allowance in non-sterling
non-dollar countries and up to
£250 sterling in dollar countries
will be replaced by a rule that
a traveller may use up to £650
sterling in any countries out-
side the sterling area.
This means that the tourist
is now automatically entitled to
a dollar allocation of £650
(provided he has the Australian
currency to pay for it!), while
additional dollars will still be
granted to businessmen, civil
servants, politicians, etc., where
the circumstances appear to
warrant it.
Interesting Sharemarket
A ustralian sharemarkets
last week maintained their
character of being representa-
tive of the second-liners and
up-and-coming newcomers
more so than of the “leaders.”
Among the leaders even the
G. J. Coles projected place-
ment of 2,400,000 ss. ords. at
a premium of 12s. 9d., with a
one-for-10 bonus-issue to
follow in August, failed to
excite the market in Coles
scrip. Certainly the placement
will bypass the granting of
“rights” to existing share-
holders, but the bonus aspect
might have had more effect
except that the current market
yield is already low at 3 p.c.
The low yields offering from
leaders is the reason for their
present quietness.
On the other hand, a divi-
dend at the rate of 20 p.c. p.a.
from Minster, Ltd. (against 15
p.c. since the div.-flow com-
menced, enhanced by a three-
for-four bonus-issue in 1956),
confirmed market anticipations
following the long rise from
235. 6d. last year to 38s. last
week for the 10s. shares. Yield
at 38s. is 5.3 p.c. from a 20
p.c. div.
Another stock to move spec-
tacularly, though not yet on
the div.-list, has been Tele-
vision Corporation. The 10s.
shares have rocketed to 265. 9d.
Last year they could have
been bought at 7s. The com-
pany is now earning a profit,
as is the case with most TV-
stations in Sydney and Mel-
bourne at present. It has been
a comparatively quick transi-
tion from the red to the black
without the outlay of exces-
sive capital.
Bradford Cotton Mills
touched 40s. again last week,
the highest point since 1957,
when they dropped to 325. 6d.
during the period of the
Burlington takeover. Even at
40s. they give the substantial
yield of 6| p.c., and are an
almost obvious choice, for
income purposes, in any
extensive portfolio, even
though further market-incre-
ment may be deferred for a
time.
Frederic Ash, which sold as
low as 445. in 1958, reached
525. 9d. last week, to offer
a yield of 5.7 p.c. still.
A comparative newcomer,
but rapidly reaching front-line
status, is Davis Gelatine. It
has been rising strongly, and
reached 465., to give a yield
of only 3.5 p.c. from an 8 p.c.
div.
There has been vigorous sup-
port at 575. for the twin stocks
Kandos Cement and Australian
Cement, controlling, between
them, the Kandos and Geelong
cement-works. These invest-
ments have a great potential,

but it is possible that benefits
from the newly opened Gee-
long plant will not begin to
flow to shareholders until the
new plant at Kandos is
installed during the next three
years and paid for out of
profits. The board has already
stated it will be financed out
of “internal resources,” and
that “it will be apparent that
this major expansion of the
works will be expensive, and
that the company’s funds will
be fully occupied.”
With this qualification as to
the next three years, however,
the potential of Kandos and
Australian Cement scrip seems
to be high indeed.

the market last week were

Kraft Takeover Offer
A lthough the offer by
National Dairy Products
Corporation, U.S.A., for the
530,827 £1 ords. in Kraft
Holdings, Ltd., not already
held by National Dairy (the
other 1,111,609 ords. are) has
been accompanied by full and
fair documentary information
concerning the takeover com-
pany, the overture is not being
accorded a glad hand by many
Australian shareholders be-
cause it is felt that the poten-
tial of the Australian company
has not been given full valua-
tion in the assessment of
comparative virtues of
National Dairy and Kraft
shares.
The offer is one $5 National
Dairy share for every five £1
Kraft shares. N.D. shares were
recently selling in New York
for the Australian equivalent
of 4425. 6d., equal to 88s. 6d.
per £1 Kraft share in the
terms of the offer. Before the
offer, Kraft shares were chang-
ing hands in Melbourne for
around 755. They shot-up to
near 88s. following the offer,
but have dropped back to 81s.
since then. National Dairy last
paid a dividend of 36 p.c. p.a.
and took 56 p.c. of its earnings
to do it. Kraft last paid 10 p.c.
p.a., which absorbed 23.2 p.c.
of its earnings. If it had dis-
tributed the same proportion
as its U.S. affiliate its ord.
div.-rate would have been
nearly 25 p.c. instead of 10 p.c.
On a 25 p.c. div.-basis its
shares would possibly have
brought £5 to £6 on the Aus-
tralian market.
In relation to earning-power,
National Dairy shares show
6.5 p.c. on market price of
$49,875 (£22 2s. 6d.). At the
same equivalent (88s. 6d.)
market price Kraft scrip shows
10 p.c.
If the Australian shares were
valued on the same ratio to
earnings as the N.D. scrip their
price would be approximately
£6 14s. instead of the equiva-
lent of 88s. 6d. offered.
Those Australians who
accept National Dairy shares
will also be subject to a 15 p.c.
U.S. withholding tax on divi-
dends received. This is partly
rebatable by Australian tax-
authorities on incomes up to
£l5OO, and fully rebatable
beyond that level. Company-
taxpayers get no rebate.
In essence, Australian share-
holders in Kraft Holdings,
Ltd., feel that they have been
skimped with dividends in the
past even where earnings have
averaged around 45 p.c. a year,
and that they are to be
deprived of the full benefit of
the potential of their under-
taking at a time when its pros-
pects never looked better.
They have been unlucky to
be partners with a well-to-do
overseas concern that keeps its
own shareholders satisfied with
a dividend of 36 p.c., and is
able to do so even though it
draws only 10 p.c. on the ord.
shares in its Australian invest-
ment, regardless of the income
expectations of its Australian
associates.
This attitude is not peculiar
as between National Dairy and
Kraft. It has applied to the
Michael Nairn interests in
Australia ; and there have
been other instances.
Deviated Boreholes
[From L. Owen]
"Preparations for drilling a
series of deviated wells
from the existing platform at
Puri, in Western Papua, are of
considerable interest, as this
is the first time that the
oblique-hole technique has
been employed in the search
for oil in Australia or its
territories.
New equipment for the
purpose has been flown from
the U.S.A.
Normally, the object of the
oil-driller is to keep the bore-
hole as nearly vertical as
possible, and modern methods
and instrumentation allow this
to be accomplished within very
small tolerances. The drilling
of intentionally-deviated wells
is, however, by no means new
to the oil industry, and the
technique has been used on
several oilfields in various
parts of the world, particularly
where the “pools” extend off-
shore under the sea, and devi-
ation is more economic than
the preparation of new loca-
tions.
The G. J. Coles Story
'T'he large, rich Coles cake is
-* being cut-up invitingly
again. A patriarchal sense has
come with its phenomenal
growth. E. B. Coles, the com-
pany’s managing - director,
announced, among other things
in the latest share arrange-
ments, a new superannuation
scheme for employees to co-
ordinate all existing schemes
so that a young man joining
the firm today will retire on
not less than 50 p.c. of his
last year’s earnings.
Of all the five Coleses —two
are now knighted—who joined-
up to found the present chain
of stores in 1919, only A.W.,
the former Lord Mayor of
Melbourne, is not now officially
connected with the business.
There is probably nothing
more salutary in the annals of
successful storekeeping than
the experience of the present
Sir George Coles and his
brother A.W. when, back
from World War I, they asked
the Repatriation Department
for a modest loan to set them
up. The file is said to have
come back endorsed “Unlikely
to succeed in business; appli-
cation refused.”




SUNDRY

Stage and Music
“The Fifth Season”
According to Max Pincus,
central character in Sylvia
Regan’s Jewish comedy at
North Sydney Independent,
there are five seasons in the
year: spring, summer, autumn,
winter and slack. This remark
raises a laugh, but allowing
for a few bright spots —where,
for instance, the models fall
all over each other to change
into the latest creations to
impress a big buyer—the plot
itself is rather slack.
In fact, it’s a plot that has
been dished-up in umpteen-
dozen variations. Therefore
you look for an extra quality,
and Miss Regan, one feels,
wisely decided to use Jewish
characters. All the action
occurs in the office-dressing-
room of a women’s clothing-
mapufacturer in New York.
Pincus and Johnny Goodwin
are in charge ; while Pincus is
money-conscious and indus-
trious, Goodwin is a bit of a
lad —20 custom-suits, but
nothing in the bank ; plenty of
high-pressure vocal power, but
ulcers as well.
When the play opens, the
partners have so many
thousands of dollars’-worth of
cheques to meet, they’re just
about down to the last straw.
Presto! Lewis, a top clothing
representative is coming;
Goodwin calls for another
suit, the girls hurriedly change,
people swarm all over the
stage.
The buyer arrives. The girls
parade. Goodwin is all set for
high-pressure tactics, but Pin-
cus urges diplomacy, with the
result that by the time Lewis
leaves the company is signed
for several healthy orders.
This financial swing is
merely a peg on which Miss
Regan hangs the subsequent
action. Goodv/in throws him-
self into the society world,
even joining Lewis’s club so as
to hobnob with the bigshots.
Taking a holiday' in Miami,
Goodwin has an affair with one_
of his models; Goodwin’s
fresh-from-school son takes
Mrs. Lewis for a run in her
car, smashes it up to the tune
of 450 dollars ; and Lewis, not
to be outdone, gets himself a
girl . . . and the repercussions
are obvious. The wrong
persons find out; Goodwin has
to square himself with his
family and climb back to the
position of faithful husband.
Through all this Pincus is
a kind of moderator, explain-
ing here, smoothing there.
When they want cash (Good-
win, his wife and his son) Pin-
cus cheerfully opens his heart
and his bottomless bank-
account. Eventually everything
ends happily, with the com-
pany firmly on its feet and
Lewis, hitherto arrogant, sub-
dued.
As Pincus, Louis Wishart is
excellent, drawing the little
Jew with an eye to slight
naivete and friendly shrewd-
ness. Owen Weingott’s Johnny
Goodwin is well done, no-
where better than in his
drunken scene; as his wife,
Jean Blarney seems a little
uncomfortable in the part, but
not so much as to detract
from a generally sound per-
formance ; and Dennis Carroll,
as the schoolboy son who
knows more than his years
suggest, is first-class. Ken
Hacker might have exag-
gerated his picture of Lewis,
the big buyer ; such a person
should be unpleasantly arro-
gant, not just arrogant. Keith
Buckley was constantly amus-
ing in his portrait of Ferelli,
the temperamental designer.
Olive Walter’s production
didn’t strike a discordant note.

“Threepenny Opera”
Bertholt Brecht’s aims seem
admirable. He wants his
audience to say: “1 wouldn’t
have thought that. People
shouldn’t do things like that.
That’s extremely odd, almost
unbelievable. This has to stop.
This person's suffering shocks
me, because there might be
a way out for him. This is
great art: nothing in it is self-
evident. I laugh over the weep-
ing, 1 weep over the laughing.”
“Jealous type —Wont budge from her sided*
Great stuff! Mr. Brecht
claims this to be essential of
“epic” theatre and he goes to
great pains to point out just
where this theory of “epic”
theatre differs from dramatic
or usual theatre.
His “Threepenny Opera,”
currently on view at Mel-
bourne’s Union Theatre, is
supposed to embody most of
this trail-blazing German’s
notions, quirks and ambitions.
In short, Mr. Brecht is out
to shock his audience into
believing something he is tell-
ing them.
Shock is more often than not
an emotional experience.
“Threepenny Opera” is more
often than not an intel-
lectual experience. Its audience
is simply not shocked. It is not
moved. It is titillated, certainly.
Sometimes it is amused, even
enlightened. But because it is
not allowed to experience
emotion it is not moved, and it
is never shocked.
But it could be shocked if
Mr. Brecht had better things
to tell us than: “Don’t preach
morals to the public until you
fill their bellies,” and so
forth. The majority of Mr.
Brecht’s views are Leftist and
mosty old-fashioned at that.
He does one thing, however.
‘"Threepenny Opera” is an
experiment and it shows the
potential of argumentative and
didactic theatre. But it must
be taken miles further. And
it must not rely on tired ideas
redecked ; and it must not
expect too much of an
audience.
In “Threepenny Opera.”
Brecht’s characters are
absurdly doll-like, but they all
hold a certain interest.
Peachum was brought to life
by Wyn Roberts and was never
boring ; Polly is a bit too con-
fectionery, yet she was well-
handled by Shirley Broadway ;
McHeath, the dandified hero,
was fostered arrogantly under
the strong hands of Edward
Webster. The Ballad Singer
was excellently realised by
George Ogilvie.
Wai Cherry’s production was
faithful to Brecht and, at the
same time, imaginative. The
same goes for William Fitz-
water’s musical direction.
Japanese Fireworks

FROM LEADING STOCK & STATION AGENTS
“It’s obvious that you prefer a suit that allows for
freedom of movement
when the Showboat settled it-
self in iront of them ; and loud
moans from car-drivers and
passengers trapped in record
bottlenecks.
This commentator, leaning
over a parapet on top of a
King’s Cross residential,
thought the display the best he
had ever seen —worth risking
a cramped neck or a possible
fall to the pavement. From
the Cross you could see most
of the Harbor, with its back-
drop of north-side homes
joined to the city by the bridge.
An (deal night: no wind ; grey,
cloud-studded sky. Other flats
dotted with people gazing
harborwards . . .
Up from Fort Denison goes a
silver flash ; then another.
They burst in perfect chrysan-
themum shape, showering the
grey water with brilliant reflec-
tions. “Oooh’s” and “Ahhh’s”
from viewers. Up again . . ,
this time the giant flower-
shapes change color, from blue
to red to white. And the
noise! “Bam! Bam! ” —like
cannon-fire. One thing that
strikes you is the incredible
height the bursting missiles
attain. This time about six
smaller ones are sent up simul-
taneously, all exploding in a
mixture of close - packed
brilliance.
The show lasted for about
45 minutes. Popular opinion
among a minority was that
it lett the fireworks display
during the Queen’s visit for
dead. And, in view of the
Japanese fireworks themselves
—perfect in shape and color,
like giant atomic flowers from
another planet—one would be
inclined to say the show was
artistically superior to most
previous celebrations.

“Beauty and the Beast”
In Canberra Repertory’s pro-
duction of “Beauty and the
Beast,” Nicholas Stuart Grey
has spun out the old myth for
children as though the adults,
.not the children, needed the
message. He has used all the
old, well - worn tricks lie-
detectors, magic incantations
and, of course, three beautiful
women —and a good deal of
time and thought was
obviously devoted to the pro-
duction. The three women —
Joey Muusze, Anne Herde and
Diana Encel—looked beautiful,
although Tony Dingle, as the
Prince, looked as though he
had had a public-school educa-
tion rather than a princely one.
Alex Lojkine, as the wizard,
and lan Bell made their contri-
butions to the atmosphere, as
did producer Anne Godfrey
Smith. The transition from the
mundane to the magic did not
occur, not through want
of trying by producer or actors,
but because in a very secular
age you need something more
than Nicholas Stuart Grey had
to offer to tease people out of
the world of the senses into
the world of make-believe.

Stereo Demonstration
A demonstration of stereo-
phonic sound in Sydney,
organised by Pye Pty., Ltd.,
helped to strengthen one’s con-
viction that this medium is
here to stay—and, if the sounds
of the evening were any
criterion, stereo may well
supersede present recording
systems.
The primary aim of stereo
is, in effect, to add a third
sound - dimension. This is
achieved by using two coupled
speakers (the speakers in Pye’s
demonstration model were
each 9in. by 6in. elliptical type)
set not less than 3ft. 6in. apart;
to hear it properly you should
sit at the same distance away
as each speaker is from the
other —suppose the speakers
are set 4ft. from each other ;
you should sit not less than
4ft. away.
Basic technical principle is
that with one needle two
sound - messages can be
separated. Thus, in a record-
ing of a piano-concerto, the
solo instrument tends to trans-
mit from the auxiliary speaker,
while the orchestra accom-
panies from the primary unit.
In straight orchestral pieces
you don’t know exactly where
the sound is coming from ; the
total effect is a broad band of
sound—almost as if you were
in the sixth row, centre, at
Sydney Town Hall.
Special stereo records are
on the market; in England
they sell at the same price as
microgroove recordings. In
Australia, with production of
stereo disks in its infancy, it
seems likely that for a time
prices for the new records will
be roughly 10 to 15 per cent,
above the cost of monaural
disks. That doesn’t mean
record-collectors who decide to
go in for stereo will be obliged
to scrap their microgrooves—
the stereo system transmits all
types of long-playing records,
and gives them added depth,
It does seem, though, that the
day of the old standard 78
r.p.m. recordings is drawing to
a close.

donated by a firm of manu-
facturers ; pictures and
refrigerators to be sold by
auction and proceeds to go to
Legacy. Thus art, charity and
commerce come together in a
common goal.
A similar notion has become
the rage of Paris, and it is said
that the great Picasso was asked
to contribute ; his reply was
rather embarrassing for our
local Picassoites —“1 like my
refrigerators white.” However,
they have all had a go with
up-and-down results. Paul
Beadle, Pugh, Hodgkinson and
Dutkiewicz express their
sense of decoration in abstrac-
tions ; Arthur Boyd has a
version of the meeting between
Leda and the Swan which
appears to be Australian, as
the bird is black. Hal Missing-
ham's arrangement of windows
in an Italian street has a mildly
naughty connotation, while
Bob Dickerson has depicted a
sickly individual who looks as
if he had accidentally locked
himself in his refrigerator all
night.
With the possible exception
of Miss Haxton and Cedric
Flower, it can hardly be said
that the artists have added any-
thing much aesthetically to the
freezers, but that is no reason
for condemning the idea—
better artists could possibly do
better. Nor is there any
inherent reason why the idea
couldn’t be extended to other
familiar domestic objects
lavatory-cans for instance.
These are usually well-pro-
portioned, but are invariably
painted a depressing black.
How much more interesting
they would look if chastely
decorated with dancing figures
or fauns pursuing nymphs
through a sylvan landscape.
Carried on the head of a hand-
some nightman as he strides
through the back gate with one
arm uplifted, they would add
a touch of beauty to the rather
drab suburban landscape. This
suggestion is offered to the
promoters of “Art in Every-
day Life” absolutely gratis.

Six Painters
The works of six Australian
artists occupy the whole of
the Verdon Gallery at the
National Gallery in Mel-
bourne. The artists are Charles
Blackman, Arthur Boyd,
Sidney Nolan, Clifton Pugh,
John Perceval and that invete-
rate prize-winner Charles Bush.
Nolan continues to concern
himself with Australia’s
national hero, and there is a
touch of pathos in his picture
of Kate Kelly devotedly quilt-
ing her brother’s armor against
a darkening landscape splashed
with an afterglow from the
“His heart's all right, really—but I Wouldn't leave
the TV on in the children's hour."
vanished sun which presum-
ably symbolises Ned’s departed
glory. There is some painterly
quality in the background
which contrasts oddly with the
complete lack of quality in
Kate’s figure, which looks like
something cut out with a pair
of scissors and gummed onto
the canvas.
This inability to see their
subject as a single thing, as a
whole, distinguishes the work
of most of the artists. Arthur
Boyd is another who is able to
deal sensitively with landscape
but whose figures seem to have
strayed out of some other
world altogether. In “River
Forest,” John Perceval pushes
paint about with his usual
vigor, and his picture certainly
gives back an impression of
vivid sunlight and green shade.

“The Roof of Jap-an”
Like Disney’s “The Living
Desert,” this absorbing
Japanese documentary has
been photographed with a
superb sense of detail and
color, and a strong feeling for
landscape, season and the grim
struggle for survival among
the many birds, animals and
insects in the alps of the
Japanese hinterland.
There is drama in a savage
fight between a hawk and a
snake ; in a mortal struggle
between two armored insects
enlarged to look like prehis-
toric monsters ; and a big
snake flowing at great speed
across sand chasing a hare.
There is comedy in the
antics of two bear-cubs who
wrestle and tumble in snow-
drifts, and in their astonish-
ment when they stumble on
the unexpected.

he takes a 100-to-one shot,
misses the enemy and gets the

carrier through the anti-sub.

it.
Ford is well cast as the
moody commander who
calmly accepts the calculated
risk, and he succeeds in cap-
turing a measure of the mental
strain before and after his first
attempt to sink his quarry.
Ernest Borgnine gives a good
performance as his executive

board the sub. have a ring of
authenticity. Surface and

He gets away to a bad start
by treading on the Big Shot’s
corns over a charity-auction,
but a famous actress gets on
side with him and brings the
B.S. around. More is at his
best in several life-of-the-party
episodes; Roland Culver is
dryly humorous as the finan-
cier, and Betsy Drake is easy
on the eye as the helpful
actress.

The WILD CAT COLUMN
Mt. Isa Mines, Ltd.
Undeterred by the weakness in base-
metal prices, Mt. Isa Mines, Ltd.,
pressed-on with its great expansion pro-
gramme last term, record quantities of
silver-lead-zinc and copper ores coming
from the big North Queensland mine.
Mill-throughput rose by about 18 p.c.
over the year and is now expected to
reach the increased, “intermediate”
target-figure of 8100 tons a day next
April, instead of next December, as
originally planned. Subsequent progress
towards the eventual aim, 13,000 tons a
day, will depend largely on the re-
habilitation of the Townsville - Mt. Isa
railway. At Townsville, the co.’s £3.5-
million electrolytic copper - refinery- is
nearing completion and the treatment of
blister copper from Mt. Isa is scheduled
to commence in June.
The inadequacies of the 600-mile rail-
link with Townsville and methods of
financing the costly replacement-job have
been the subject of numerous conferences
between Mt. Isa, the Queensland and
Federal Governments and various other
bodies, but, although the problem seems
closer to solution than it' has been in
the past, the board has been unsuccess-
ful, so far, in its attempts to reach final
agreement on a basis acceptable to the co.
Silver-lead-zinc ore accounted for
140,043 tons and copper ore for 110,214
tons of the extra 250,257 tons of ore
put through the mill last term:

Another 4477 tons of lead-copper dross,
containing 241,6230 z. silver, 2958 tons
lead and 805 tons copper, was also pro-
duced.
Zinc concentrates are exported, mainly
to the U.K. and Europe, the
silver - lead bullion going to a sub-
sidiary lead - refiner in the U.K.
while, in the past, blister copper in
excess of Australian requirements or
refining-capacity has been refined in the
U.S. As a result of these marketing
arrangements the co. has escaped the
direct effects of U.S. restrictions on the
import of lead and zinc, but, at the same
time, it will derive no benefit from the
recent jump in the local price of the two
metals (to £lOO a ton in both cases), and,
by virtue of its earning-rate, has missed-
out on the Federal Government’s copper-
bounty.
Average prices received last term aren’t
divulged, but metal sales, less transport,
refining and realisation expenses, fell by
£5.8 million to £11.4 million (or from
£12.24 to £6.89 per ton of ore treated),
opening and closing stocks being valued
at cost. Economies flowing from the
higher output (and a smaller lead-bonus)
reduced mining-, milling- and smelting-
expenses from £7.45 to £4.89 per ton of
ore treated, but, while this gain took a
little of the sting out of depressed metal
prices, the mine - surplus shrank by
£3,419,258 to £3,309,478.
As the liability for taxation will in-
crease with the future diminution in
capital-expenditure, a provision for tax-
equalisation has been charged against
earnings in each of the last two terms.
A substantial cut (from £1,100,000 to
£350,000) in the amount so provided last
term, along with the curtailment of ex-
penditure on exploration and develop-
ment (£86,806, down £109,488) and big
reductions in provisions for current
taxation (£250,000, down £550,000),
depreciation (£1,001,111, down £226,806)
and royalties (£26,569, down £103,431)
helping to slash p.-and-l. expenses
(£1,897,767) by £1,726,536. In spite of
these savings net earnings in the pub-
lished (parent’s) accounts tumbled from
£3,140,823 to £1,424,129.
The profit represented a little under
22y p.c. on the £6,333,043 of share-
capital paid-up at June 30 last and, to
conserve funds needed for expansion
projects, half of the unchanged Is. 3d.
(25 p.c.) div. was paid in scrip, the actual
cash distribution falling £71,966 below
that of the previous term, when 40 p.c.
of the div. went out as bonus-shares:

In the circumstances, the bonus-
issue procedure seems reasonable
enough and gives present share-
holders the option of realising on
the big sharemarket-premium on the
scrip, or of holding a bigger claim than
newcomers in future distributions. How-
ever, in a mine less promising than Mt.
Isa the issue of bonus-scrip in lieu of
cash dividends could prove a particularly
empty gesture.
Mt. Isa’s shareholding in the erstwhile
parent and now wholly-owned subsidiary,
Mining Trust, Ltd., was written-up by
£2,300,000 during the year as a prelude,
presumably, to the liquidation of this
co. “at a suitable time.”
Despite the limited amount of ex-
ploration and development carried out
there was another big jump in ore-
reserves, estimated reserves of silver-
lead-zinc ore rising by 3,500,000 tons and
of copper ore by 3,850,000 tons:

Further large tonnages of ore have
been indicated by diamond-drilling, etc.,
and, on the score of ore reserves, there
seems to be ample justification for the
board’s assurance that “the mine would
enjoy a long life at the proposed, in-
creased production-rates.”
The year’s net addition to fixed assets
was £3,455,407 (of which £2,444,968 went
into the parent co.’s accounts), retained
earnings, provisions and big reductions
in stocks (down £2,240,831) and stores
(down £942,066) providing most of the

A private issue of £1,500,000 of
debenture-stock has been arranged to
finance completion of the copper-refinery,
but, with the general improvement in
base-metal prices in the current term, the
co. can be expected to adhere to its
basic policy of financing the bulk of
its capital-expenditure from earnings and
provisions—except, perhaps, in the un-
likely event of a speedy reconstruction
of the Townsville-Mt. Isa railway. This
policy leaves little room for an early
lift in the div.-rate, although the return
to an all-cash payout may not be long
delayed.
The magnitude of Mt. Isa’s expansion
plans (designed, in part, to keep costs
at a competitive level in world markets)
and the co.’s possible earning-potential
glow with long-term promise; and at
345. 6d. the f.-p. ss. ords. are priced
for the patient buyer, prepared to accept
this somewhat speculative promise and
make-do in the meantime with a yield
of £3 12s. sd. p.c. from a 25 p.c. cash div.
\
Reichhold Chemical Industries
(Australia), Ltd.
elchhold made its bow to the share-
market early in 1955 and speedily
established itself as a star trouper.
Profit admittedly hasn’t grown or
changed significantly in the four years
since then, but it was high to begin
with, averaging very nearly the quarter-
million a year.
To be conceded also is a rather sharp
drop in the unit earning-rate, following
issues of new scrip for a takeover, for
cash, and as a bonus. But it could be
a case of consolidation for future
development, and the next decade of
Reichhold’s career will probably hold
prizes for the patient.
Initially capital was £600,000 in 10s.
ords., of which a quarter was placed
with the public to qualify Reichhold for
a place in the call-room. A further
£103,042 of new stock was issued in
1955-56, on the acquisition of Euston
Chemical Industries, Ltd., and equity-
shareholders reaped an early harvest
when in 1956-57 there was a twin issue,
£351,521 of stock for cash at par, one-
for-two, accompanied by a bonus-issue in
the same proportion. These were the
issues which raised capital to its present
homogeneous £1,406,084.
The three major shareholdings re-
mained in thfe hands of Reichhold
Chemicals Inc., Detroit, U.S.A., and
Viti Pty., over a quarter-share each, and
Colonial Gas Holdings, Ltd., which last
year sold its approximately one-eighth
holding on the open market, depressing
values slightly, but widening interest in
the stock.
The parent works through four manu-
facturing operators —Reichhold Chemi-
cals Inc. (Aust.), Euston Chemical Indus-
tries, Nuodex (Australia), and A. C.
Hatrick (N.Z.), with factories in the
Sydney, Melbourne and Wellington
(N.Z.) areas. Selling and importing sub-
sidiaries in Australia and N.Z. carry the
Hatrick label.
In 1939 the Reichhold proprietary was
formed to manufacture, under licence and
royalty, products of the American
affiliate of the same name, which,
together with Colonial Gas and A. C.
Hatrick Pty., subscribed the whole of
the issued capital.
The U.S. co. is the world’s largest
manufacturer of synthetic resins, and
also makes chemical colors, plasticisers
and industrial chemicals. These products,
also made by the Australian group, are
too diverse and technical to detail, but
suffice it'to say that Reichhold’s fortunes
are largely bound-up with the paint in-
dustry as a whole, the biggest customer.
A. C. Hatrick Pty. is an Australia-
wide merchandising organisation, con-
ducting a 40-year-old indenting business,
which sells, imports and exports indus-
trial chemicals and chemical plant.
Balance-sheet movements should be
treated with discretion. The decline in
book-debts was mostly due to the paying-
off of a balance of £82,500 owing on a
sale of property acquired by takeover.
Creditors apparently were down, and
stocks rose by £72,723. There was little
change in the fairly tolerable working
finances, with more-or-less liquid assets
leading current liabilities (£770,928) by
£599,373 on June 30 figures. It seems
not improbable that there will be further
recourse to the money-market in the not-
too-distant future:

Freeholds stood £88,047 higher at the
end of the year, and of the £872,901
shown, £619,250 is at the 1956 revalua-
tion figure which foreshadowed the
bonus, and £265,651 at cost, all, appa-
rently, less some depreciation. There are
no intangibles, and the £1,953,819 of
shareholders’ funds gives each 10s. stock-
unit a net tangible cover of 13s. lid.
Last term’s consolidated net profit was
a little higher than in previous years, but
represented only 18.1 p.c. on average
capital, compared with 40.5 p.c. in 1955,
and 35.6 (1956) and 21.0 (1957) for the
intervening years:

The £254,813 remained after provid-
ing for all expenses, including £136,540
(up £3777) for taxation and £100,763
(up £28,063) for depreciation. These
figures certainly look according to Hoyle.
The dividend-rate for last year was
lifted to 11| p.c., from the 11 p.c. to
which it had been cut following the
bonus. The final was 6| p.c., but whether
this presages 124 p.c. for 1958-59 is
conjectural.
In contrast to the frenzied post-war
splurge which enlivened the paint in-
dustry, things are now comparatively
quiet following the recent mild recession
in this sector. There is spare capacity
to burn, and Reichhold hasn’t been
unscathed entirely. This, however, has
been disguised by the spectacular in-
crease in its installations which preceded
last year’s consolidation, boosting turn-
over figures sufficiently to offset the
tightening profit-margins.
Further expansion is mooted, but as
things are, the stock at 265. 9d. with its
yield of 4.4 p.c. from an 11| p.c. div.-
rate doesn’t look overly cheap, since the
visible earning yield is only 6.8 p.c.

Queensland Cement and
Lime Co.
When proposed plant-exten-
sions are completed early
in 1961, Queensland Cement
and Lime expects to be in a
position to meet all demand
for cement, arising in the next
10 years, in an area stretching
from the Northern Rivers dis-
trict of N.S.W. to Mackay
(North Queensland), Darwin
and New Guinea. The larger,
by far, of Queensland’s two
cement-manufacturers, Queens-
land Cement holds a 17 p.c.
interest in the second producer,
North Australian Cement, Ltd.,
which supplies the far-north
of the State from a plant at
Townsville.
Since 1949 the annual out-
put of cement from Queens-
land Cement’s works at Darra
(near Brisbane) has risen from
around 150,000 tons to over
250,000 tons, plant-capacity
reaching 300,000 tons a year
towards the end of last term.
Over the same period, paid
capital has leapt from £245,061
to £1,567,561, par issues con-
tributing £996,443 to this in-
crease (and to the cost of plant-
additions), and a one-for-three
bonus-issue in 1955 another
£326,057. Earnings have more
than kept pace with capital,
last term’s net profit working-
out at close to 84 times the
1949 figure:—

It is now intended to erect
a big, new kiln (the co.’s fifth)
which, when completed will
take total plant-capacity to
500,000 tons a year, and, to-
gether with ancillary plant, cost
in the vicinity of £1,200,000.
To this end, shareholders have
been asked to put up a further
£522,520 of ord. capital over
the next two years, one new
ord. being offered at par for
every three ords. or prefs.
already held. Application- and
allotment-money, of 4s. a share,
is due in April, calls of 2s.
following at three - monthly
intervals.
The issue will lift paid
capital to £2,090,081, including
£48,878 in Bp.c„ and £187,122
in 6 p.c., participating prefs.
The pref. div.-rates advance
point for point with the ord.
rate once the latter exceeds
6 p.c.
Boosted by the installation
of a new kiln in 1953, earnings
advanced at a slower pace last
term in the absence of any
marked growth in demand,
cement sales rising by 4 p.c.
(volume) to 257,753 tons, after
a 10 p.c. jump in 1956-57. Still,
at £181,530, net profit was the
highest to date and £ll,lll
ahead of the previous term’s
effort, despite a heavier pro-
vision for depreciation (up
£36,657 at £196,962) and a
£2968 slip in investment-in-
come, etc. (£30,537).
Written after making “full
provision for taxation,” the
higher profit covered minimum

final call on scrip issued in 1956)
and 5.5 p.c. on total average

finances in good trim, and with
retained earnings and pro-
visions easily covered the
£258,540 put into plant, work-
ing capital rising by £16,000
to £356.693.
A £76,545 increase in stocks
(at co. valuation) and a £47,625
drop in book-debts could
suggest a slip in trading activity
towards the end of the year,
although large stocks of coral
(an alternative raw-material to
the more commonly used lime-
stone) were built-up and would
account, in part, for the higher
stock-figure:

The present combined plant-
capacity of Queensland Cement
and North Australian Cemenf
(approximately 380,000 tons a
year) appears adequate to cope
with immediate Queensland
requirements, and, in forecast-
ing the maintenance of the
current div.-rates, the board is
banking on the development of
its markets in northern N.S.W.
and New Guinea, along with
the expansion of sales in the
home State and the gradual
introduction of the new capital.
Nevertheless, the price of
cement manufactured by the
co. compares favorably with
prices ruling in other States,
and there should "be no great
difficulty in stretching sales and
holding the div.-rates, which,
after the final call in January,
1961, will require £209,905, or
£28,375 more than the profit
claimed last term. .

Creamoata, Ltd.
Tn its ten years as a Victorian
public company, Creamoata
hasn’t shown much fire and
sparkle. Competition, both at
home and abroad, is rife in the
milling industries, and, taking
a line through firms similarly
engaged, Creamoata’s manage-
ment seems to be doing the best
it can.
Exports of flour and allied
products in particular have
been hard-hit by a general
world oversupply of primary
commodities, and, with the
U.S. embarrassed by huge
stockpiles of semi - storables,
this side of the picture is be-
coming increasingly less attrac-
tive.
Creamoata must now, per-
force, lean more heavily on
the home market, and last term
it added an established manu-
facturer of household flour-
mixes to its ranks, in a drive
for increased consumer - sup-
port through brand - name
competition and ready-packed
products.
Group sales last term were
down perceptibly, a net
£1,600,594 being recorded com-
pared with a turnover of
£1,746,931 for 1956-57. But
home sales were a good deal
higher, and, since these bring
in pound - for - pound much
more profit than overseas sales,
there was adequate compensa-
tion for the decrease in exports
of oat-products and flour.
Thus it was that in what
could hardly be described as
a favorable selling climate,
Creamoata rang-up its best net
profit to date, £49,910 clear
of £20,400 (down £2612) pro-
vided for taxation, £20,082
(down £1640) for depreciation,
and, a surprisingly big increase,
£213,647 (up £51,515) for all
other items of outgo. Trading
profit itself was £304,039, com-
pared with £246,945 in 1957,
and perhaps sales - promotion
and advertising have tem-
porarily offset what looks to
be a rather promising gain:

The 6 p.c. dividend was the
highest since 1953, since when
shareholders have averaged a
return of no more than 2.8

two of the years.
Financially, Creamoata con-
tinues to improve its position,
which, however, is still by no

Rock Salt
[From h. Owen]
\Jl7apet’s weekly press-release
for January 20, after
stating that its Frome Rocks
well had reached a depth of
2490 ft., included this excep-
tionally interesting piece of
information:
Drilling was temporarily sus-
pended at 11 p.m. on Saturday
[January 17] for the purpose of
converting the drilling-fluid to a
saturated salt mud to permit con-
tinued drilling through the rock-
salt formation encountered below
2263 ft.
The occurrence of rock-salt is
not uncommon in other parts of the
world, but this is the first occasion
that a significant quantity has been
encountered while drilling in Western
Australia.
In other words, the Frome
Rocks well has drilled through
227 ft. of rock-salt without
reaching the base of the
deposit. The 227 ft. is not a
great thickness of salt by
world standards, but it cer-
tainly is “a significant quantity”
for Australia. Its significance,
in fact, extends far beyond the
encountering of a thick stratum
of rock-salt for the first time
on the Australian mainland,
and the occurrence demands
intensive study.
Most important is the
probability that such salt-
bodies have been a major
factor influencing the discre-
pancies between geophysical
forecasts (as interpreted with-
out knowledge of the existence
of sizeable masses of salt) and
well-logs in the Kimberleys. It
can necessitate the recalcula-
tion of much of the survey data
and a drastic revision of the
interpretation of that data ; it
may even force a change in
the type of geophysical survey.
From information already
published, it would appear
either («) that the Frorne
Rocks salt-bed is a Triassic
evaporite, or ( b ) that the salt
has been forced up along the
Fenton fault system from pre-
Triassic strata. The difference
is important from the commer-
cial angle.
In this connection, it may
be recalled that the foundations
of 1.C.1. were laid in the
English salt-deposits.
No analyses of the Frome
Rocks salt have yet been
published, hut, if it contains
a recoverable percentage of
potash, its value to Australian
primary industry will be incal-
culable. And this is quite apart
from any oil which may be
struck. In any case, the salt
will be a boon to Australian
chemical industry; at worst,
it will allow a vast improve-
ment in the quality of our
table-salt.


them as a matter of course,
and there was no embargo on
the export of protected-animal
skins. But the man who caught
them was treated as a criminal
of the lowest kind, and if he
could not pay the fine he was
sent to jail. It was 15 years
later when the buyer was
judged guilty equally with the
trapper.
'T'he Warrumbungle Range is
worthy of a visit. Mount
Exmouth, the highest point,
is over 4000 ft. above sea-level.
Moppera, the middle peak, is
3000, and Bulaway, where we
had erected the fence, 3300.
Not high as mountains go, but
on the western side there are
no foothills.
Coming from Coonamble
there is a rocky hill probably
half-a-mile long and 100 ft.
high. This is known as the
Magometon. It looks like a
boulder thrown off the
Warrumbungles in the early
days of the world. Rising
straight out of the plain,
it seemed very lonely as
Dutchy remarked the first time
we saw it: “A calf that had
strayed from its mother.”
Twenty miles of flat country
again, and Mount Tenandra
rose up in a similar way. The
Magometon is very narrow, but
Tenandra covered a few
hundred acres. Another 10
miles, and the rise in the land
could be noticed. From this
point to the top of Mount
Exmouth would be no more
than 10 miles, which gave it
the appearance of being likely
to topple over at any moment.
The real scenic beauty of
the Warrumbungles lies in the
Beladgery Valley. Following
Beladgery Creek into the
mountains one comes to a pass
barely 50yds. wide. This pass
runs a half-mile, with cliffs
500 ft. high, then gradually
opens out into a fertile valley.
Scores of small valleys run off
the main one (each then
inhabited by a bull and his
harem), and each of these small
valleys has a narrow entrance,
similar to the main valley.
Alan Cunningham was the
first to explore the Warrum-
bungles. He was reputed to be
in the habit of carrying seed of
various trees and plants, and
planting them at different
places along his route.
Oil Beladgery Creek was a
peach-tree, still bearing, which
was known as Cunningham’s
Tree. As I saw it in 1907, that
tree would be over 70 years
old. It seems a mighty age for
a peach-tree to bear fruit, but
men who had been born on
Gumin, and were well up in
years, got very annoyed if one
expressed any doubt about the
age of the tree. I have no
opinion on the matter, but
they were very good peaches.
Tn July we shore at Calga.
Taken up by De Mestre in
1835, it had been a big place,
somewhere round the half-
million acres, but over the
years it had been cut down
considerably. Sheep were
good, and some big tallies were
cut. I stayed round the hun-
dred-and-twenty, and Dutchy
fought hard‘for the “century”
but just failed. He was quite
happy about it, as there were
four men well below him, and
in his previous sheds he had
been “drummer” every time.
We had a good run till near
the cut-out. With only a
couple of thousand to shear,
“Hughie” answered the prayers
of the loppies with a fairly
heavy shower. Had it been a
few days earlier the shearers
would have knocked-off with-
out any hesitation, but with
only a day’s shearing to cut-
out the flock most of the men
were eager to finish and get
away. The rep. called for a
vote, and the majority voted
dry.
Billy Dawson, one of the old
blade-shearers, was very insis-
tent that the sheep were too
wet to shear. He reckoned that
shearing wet sheep was the
quickest way to acquire
rheumatism that he knew of,
but as the vote had been dry
he was compelled to shear.
His first sheep was rough
and cranky, kicking and
struggling all the time. As a
result Bluey cut him. rather
badly in several places. The
boss of the board chipped
him: “Look here, Dawson,
you’ll have to shear better
than that. That sheep is
covered in blood.” Bluey
snapped back: “that ain’t
sheep’s blood. It’s outer the
frogs in the wool.” The
boss scratched his head,
grinned, and walked away.
I had voted dry, but never
did so again if I considered the
sheep wet. After the first three
sheep I was soaked to the skin.
The wool was doughy and con-
tinually clogged the combs and
cutters.
TlfE went to Mount Tenandra
on the Sunday, and
started shearing after lunch.
O. E. Friend, whom we had met
before in his Highland rigout,
was in full regalia, and attract-
ing a lot of attention from the
newcomers.
About a dozen men from
Calga had shorn at Mount
Tenandra the previous year,
and those who had not seen
him before had been eager to
get the details from those of us
who knew him. And the burn-
ing question was: “Does he
wear anything under that little
skirt?” (Fifty years later, I
have to admit that I still can’t
answer that question.) But
Friend wasn’t a bad bloke.
Dutchy and I were the first
to arrive, and went up to the
woolshed looking for Mr.
Woodward. He was pleased to
see us, and introduced us to
Friend. He did not offer to
shake hands, but on his;> daily
visit to the shed he always had
a friendly smile and a nod for
us.
Brummy Field was with us
again. His dry wit always kept
the shed roaring with laughter
during smoke-ohs. I asked
him had he gone to Sydney
after last shearing. “No,” he
replied, “I didn’t make it,” but
added brightly: “I nearly got
there. I had sixty-quid, and I
got to Mendooran, where I met
a cobber who had a good thing
for the races. Well, I reckoned
I’d build up the sixty a bit, and
I put twenty on this moke, and
it ran third. So, only having
forty-quid left, I got on the
booze and it didn’t last long.”
For thirty years Brummy
had worked and saved for that
trip to Sydney, but he seldom
got past the first pub. He was
a type that was well known in
the bush, in those times. A
good shearer, stockman and
all - round bushworker, he
would live frugally, but not
meanly, till he had a nice sum
of money saved-up, then blue it
up in one wild spree.
Woodward was a good boss,
and popular with all hands,
and the shearing went on
smoothly. Good weather right
through, and everyone was
happy, except the rousies.
They reckoned “Hughie” had
Jet them down again.
Dutchy broke the “century,”
and after tea the rep. called
all hands to attention, and
made a speech praising
Dutchy, and welcoming him to
the ranks of the big-gun
shearers. Dutchy replied in a
neat little speech, and sug-
gested the union should pass
a law compelling all the rousies
to address him as “Mr. Bishop”
or at least “Sir.” This matter
was solemnly discussed, and
finally decided to be against
all union principles, and
Dutchy was fined four songs.
We finished-up at midnight,
and I think everyone had a
sore throat. I know I did.
After Mount Tenandra,
Gumin was a let-down.
There were only six of us who
went to Gumin from Tenan-
dra. All the others were
strangers, and a most un-
friendly lot. In the first week
there were two fights, both over
trifles; in fact they were
childish little squabbles that
developed into bloody fights.
We were lucky in avoiding
trouble. One chap came up the
second day, and said he had
seen me boxing with George
Ruenalf in Brewarrina. He
said he thought 1 could have
beaten George, and I agreed
that I had the same opinion.
He must have seen me when
George was letting me show-
off a bit. But we had no
further worry about getting
into strife. We were treated
with respect by all, and went
about our shearing quietly, and
had little to say.
Dutchy refrained from his
usual pranks with the rousies;
there was no singing at night;

and gambling, mostly
Napoleon, or Nap as it is
usually called, was the only
form of amusement. As we
knew all the station-hands we
would go over to the men’s
hut for a yarn, or visit one of
the married men’s homes,
where we were always sure of
a cup of tea and a slice of cake
before we went back to the
shed huts.
The boss of the board,
O'Connor, was also the
manager of the station. A man
with a great idea of his own
importance, he was the only
boss who ever faulted my
shearing. We were shearing
six-tooth wethers at the time,
and they were fairly rough.
I had a look round the other
counting-pens and I couldn’t
see any sheep better shorn than
mine. I told O’Connor this,
and he said: “I’m the judge of
how sheep are shorn here.”
Never noted for a meek dis-
position, I repled: “You
wouldn't know the difference
between a sheep and an emu.
You probably wish we were
back in the days of the raddle-
stick.” He said: “I would have
used it freely on your sheep.”
And I said: “No doubt, and
I’d have rammed it down your
throat.” After this pleasant
little discussion, he gave me no
further trouble.
Then we got the rain. It
came down all night, and the
sun was shining in the morning.
The sheep that had been under
cover were shorn in a couple of
hours, and the rousies were
jubilant, but not for long. The
owners, if they wished, could
compel them to work at any
job on the station while it was
not actually raining. Not
many stations took advantage
of this clause of the Shed-
hands Agreement, but Gumin
was one of the few.
It was really a farce, as none
of the men would work. We
went for a stroll, and watched
a gang who were “stick-
picking.” Two men would pick
up a branch no bigger than a
broom-handle and, pretending
to be bowed with the weight,
carry it to a heap 100yds. away,
while the station ganger stood
grinning at them. Half-a-
dozen would gather round a
log that any one of them could
lift, and for half-an-hour
would discuss ways and means
of shifting it. Sometimes one
would bend down and grasp
the end of the log, grunting
and straining to show the
impossibility of moving it.
Then the ganger would come,
hoist it on his shoulder and
carry it to a heap, while the
rousies commented admiringly
on his strength, comparing him
with Donald Dinnie, Sandow
and other strong men of the
time. No matter how little
work they did they could not
be sacked while on station jobs.
After advising them not to
work too hard we went to our
bunks and slept the afternoon
away.
Tt rained every night for a
•* week, and altogether we
lost eight days’ shearing. To
several men this lost time
meant they would miss-out on
their next shed. There were
always plenty of shearers to
take the place of those who,
for some reason or other, failed
to turn-up for the roll-call.
(Dutchy and I missed Calga,
two seasons back, by one
hour.) So tempers were frayed,
and quarrels were frequent.
We managed to avoid getting
involved by keeping away from
the huts as much as possible.
When the last sheep went
down the chute everyone was
happy, and in two hours every
man, shearer or shed-hand, was
on his way home or to the
nearest pub or another shed.
We went to Box Ridge, a
village consisting of a store
(which was also post-office),
four houses and a dance-hall.
No pub.
Granny Ingles took in occa-
sional boarders, and we
decided to have a week with
her and enjoy a bit of home-
cooking. It may be hard to
believe, but for three months,
we had not tasted butter, milk
cr green vegetables of any
kind. Such things were never
seen in shearers’ huts or camps;
there was no way of keeping
them. Our only luxuries were
jam or, in a mean shed, treacle
or golden - syrup (otherwise
“cocky’s joy"). Spuds were the
only vegetable, and never too
many of them.
Granny showed us through
the garden, where we swooped
on a lettuce each. She
reproved us gently: “You boys
won’t be able to eat any tea.”
Dutchy stopped chewing long
enough to say, “Who wants
any tea?” But we did a very
good job on the meal she set
before us.
Granny Ingles was known
and loved by every man,
woman and child for 50 miles.
The local midwife, she claimed
anyone who was under 30 and
had been born in the district as
“one of my babies.”
T think it was the third day
of our stay with her when
a worried-looking man, driving
a pair of straggly horses, came
to Granny’s house and said
his wife was having a baby.
Granny asked a few ques-
tions, and then went into
action. She took one look at
the man’s horses, standing with
heads drooping and sides heav-
ing; then ordered us to get her
own horses in the buggy. In
10 minutes she was on her way
to Salty Creek, which was 15
miles away, but rough tracks
and dark nights held no terrors
for Granny Ingles.
Neither of us slept very
well that night. I heard Dutchy
turn over and sigh deeply
several times. I knew that he
was following Granny on that
trip, the same as I was. We
had offered to accompany her,
but she said she would travel
faster with less weight.
We were asleep when she
returned. 1 heard the rattle of
pots and pans in the kitchen
and took no notice, thinking
it was Polly, her daughter, get-
ting breakfast for her brother
Billy. He had not been home
when Granny had left, but
they were not worried about
their mother’s journey. Polly
said: “I’ve got used to Mum’s
trips. She has been rushing off
in a hurry longer than I can
remember.”
But it wasn’t Polly in the
kitchen. Granny put her head
round the doorway, and said
in her gentle voice: “Dear me,
are you boys going to stay in
bed all day?” We both spoke
at once: “Is everything all
right?” She answered: “A
beautiful girl, and the mother,
is quite well.” I know I had a
lump in my throat, and
Dutchy’s eyes were blinking,
and his voice had a queer high
note, with a gulp at the end.
I drove out with Granny the
next day. . The hut was the
usual boundary-rider’s home,
just about one class above the
aboriginal guny a h. How
people lived in them, and
reared children, is beyond me.
We had camped at Salty Creek
v/hen building the fence
between Goorianawa and
Gumin, but another family had
been living there then. The
piesent family had been only
six months in occupation. The
nearest neighbor, Mrs. Bradley,
whom I knew, was looking
after the mother. She would
drive eight miles to Salty Creek
every day, look after Mrs.
Sands till the husband came
home, which was mostly sun-
down, then drive back to feed
her own brood.
Mrs. Sands had four
children, besides the new baby.
The eldest child was eight. As
ROCKS AND A SHIP
All about us there are envious rocks.
Why our ship moves, while they’re stuck stock-fast,
Seems to confound them —so many solid blocks
Of space abandoned to an archaic past.
If there were veins of metal in them, some gleam
In their dross, they would not be such a dead loss.
They have to be buoyed, marked by a lighthouse beam,
Because in their steadfastness they are dangerous.
If you run on them —consult them, as it were —
You will learn how obdurate a point is
In a straight line. Steer around. ~ Don’t defer.
Give them no second look for a near miss.
The wonder is not in them, but in the sweep
Of this shifting ground, the moving ship.
QUEENSLAND.
JOHN BLIGHT.


the baby had been born an
hour after Granny arrived, I
wondered what Mrs. Sands had
been thinking of while her
husband was away. Women
would know.
On the way back I did a lot
of thinking, mainly about
pioneers. I was really trying
to answer my own question:
“Who are the real pioneers of
this country?” The women,
like Granny Ingles, Mrs. Sands
and Mrs. Bradley, will have
my vote every time.
’IIS7E had intended to stay only
a week at Box Ridge, but
Dutchy had an outbreak of
boils, and Granny took charge
of him. He was certainly in
no condition to go on the track,
and I reckoned he was lucky to
be in such good hands.
The mail-driver from Gul-
argambone to Baradine
wanted a couple of weeks off,
so I took the job. The mail-
coach was one of the famous
Cobb and Co.’s Probably 20
years old, it was still in good
condition. Leather springs,
known as “through braces,”
were still used. It rolled, and
1 should imagine the passengers
would get seasick on long
trips. The original cushions
were still in good' order, and
.12 passengers could be seated
comfortably. I had never
driven four-in-hand before, but
the horses knew their work,
and I had no trouble with
them.
I picked up the mail at Gular
at three in the afternoon, went
back to Box Ridge, where I
stayed the night, leaving at
eight next morning. I dropped
mail and parcels at Mount
Tenandra and Wingedgeen;
changed horses at Goorianawa;
then on to Bugaldi and Bara-
dine, reaching there at four.
1 stayed the night; then back
to Box Ridge the next day.
The trip—Gular to Baradine —
was just 70 miles, and fresh
horses were used on alternate
trips. I did the journey twice
a week, and found it somewhat
boring unless I had a few pas-
sengers to yarn away the time.
Perhaps if there had been bush-
rangers about to stick me up
occasionally it would have
been more interesting.
Dick Knight, the regular
driver, had driven on various
runs for Cobb and Co. A little
old man, close to 70, he had
been driving coaches most of
his life. Born in Bathurst, he
had known many of the bush-
rangers well, but had never
been bailed-up. He had been
a close friend of Johnny Vane,
who had died the year before
(1906).
Dick told me the story of
Jack Skellicorn, who had bet
£lOO that he could ride from
Bathurst to Sydney between
sunrise and sunset on the one
horse. He completed the ride
with an hour to spare, but the
other chaps, who had followed
him, with several changes of
horses, refused to pay because
a few times he had dismounted
for some purpose or other, and
before remounting had led his
horse a few yards. Therefore,
they argued, he had not
ridden the horse all the way
to Sydney. A dirty point, but,
as Dick remarked, “They saved
their money, but were the most
unpopular men in Bathurst for
many years.”
TAutchy being well again, and
tired of loafing, we took-
on a fencing-contract for
Frank Dowling at Walla, and
became members of the
employers’ class.
We decided that the ruling
wage of 25-bob and tucker for
fencing was not enough, so we
raised it to 30-bob. Our first
man was Ben Bridge, a great
worker. He had been to the
Boer War, and had been one
of Harry Morant’s Bushveldt
Carabineers. Ben had been
forced to watch the execution
of Morant, and had a fierce
hatred of Kitchener, and all
British Army officers.
Our second man was Arthur.
We were pitching camp when
Arthur came along and asked
for a job. He was a proper
scarecrow —tall, gaunt, clothes
flapping in the wind, long hair
and straggly whiskers. His
swag was two wheat-bags tied-
up with bits of wire and rope.
Definitely a bit gone in the
head, I thought. Out of pity, I
fold him he could have a week,
to earn a few bob for the track.
I reckoned it would be 30-bob
wasted. I was wrong. I asked
his name, and he said,
“Arthur.” I said, “Arthur
what?” He repeated,
“Arthur.” So I gave up then.
It is not considered good
form to ask too many questions
about a man’s name, or to
probe into his past too deeply,
among bushmen. So Arthur
was near enough for us.
We started cutting posts next
morning. There was plenty of
good timber, mostly cypress-
pine. Ben worked with me,
felling, while Dutchy and
Arthur barked the logs and
marked-off post lengths.
When the first log was ready
Arthur grabbed the saw and
said, “I’ll cut ’em off.” He
drove the saw through the logs
as if they were his personal
enemies. Every time it went
through he would give a yell
of triumph, as though he had
won a victory. He was the
best single-handed sawyer any
of us had ever seen.
When he had a dozen
lengths ready, he took the
hammer and wedges, and
started splitting, saying, “It
does a man good to have a
change of work.” He used the
hammer with the same fury
as he had the saw. I thought
he would be beat in an hour, but
at knock-off time he seemed to
be as fit as ever.
Whatever his past might
have been, he was certainly a
timber-man and a toiler. At
the camp he would seldom join
the conversation, but would sit
for an hour at a time staring
at nothing, and his lips moving,
as though talking to someone.
He had a passion for cleanli-
ness, and some of his rags
would be hanging from a tree
nearly every night. His age
could have been anything from
30 to 50, and he never smoke,
drank or swore. Dutchy had a
very extensive repertoire of
lurid words, and when he was
having a session Arthur would
shake his head and reprove him
gently. And, strange to say,
Dutchy’s language became
very moderate when with
Arthur. He never worried
about Ben or me ; perhaps he
thought we were too far gone
to bother about.
T>en Bridge is worthy of
further mention. Thirty-
five years of age, ex-soldier,
shearer, drover and all-round
bushman, he, too, was tireless.
1 fancied myself at putting up
posts, but Ben always finished
the day with a few ahead.
At night he was always
ready to sing a song—he had
a very good baritone voice—or
tell a yarn. He told many
stories about his uncle,
who was probably the
last of the cattle-duffers.
When finally arrested and
lodged in Blackall (Queens-
land) Ben’s uncle had set fire
to the jail and escaped, and had
never been heard of again.
He had also been concerned
with another man when they
lifted 3000 sheep from Calga,
Goorianawa and Warrina with
the intention of droving them
to Dubbo and there selling
them. They nearly succeeded,
but made the same mistake as
did Starlight in Robbery Under
■ A rms. On the stock-route near
Gulargambone several prize
rams joined the flock, and they
took them along. These rams
belonged to Miss Mary
Ferguson, of. Gular station,
and had recently been bought
from a Victorian stud at a stiff
price. A few miles from
Dubbo, several buyers came
out to inspect the sheep, and
the stock-agent who took the
prospective buyers out
happened to be the man who
had bought the rams for Miss
Ferguson. He recognised
them, and sent for the police.
Ben’s uncle, realising the
game was up, went for his life
and got clean away. His mate
tried to bluff it out, but got
three years’ imprisonment.
Ever after, he trod the straight
and narrow path, but Ben’s
uncle merely shifted his
activities to Queensland, where
for several years he was a thorn
in the side of many a squatter,
till finally yarded at Blackall.

“Supremo”
By ROLLO GILLESPIE
‘ < a nyone can make a
mistake the first time,
JL JL but if a man makes
the same mistake
twice, he must be a bloody
fool and not much good to
the Service.”
A sound philosophy, and
one which gave rough comfort
to a junior officer the first
time it came from a Supreme
Allied Commander (aged 46),
who had just completed a vic-
torious campaign.
A good man to serve under,
even at close quarters, he was
always producing new and
stimulating theories for
example, that some (less dis-
tinguished) admirals and
generals loathed admitting that
they had ever made mistakes
because they were suffering
from the first twinges of
senile decay. But at least some
of them measured-up to his
own standards, because they
weren’t “orthodox” (and to call
an officer orthodox was the
worst thing that Lord Louis
could say about him).
Touis Francis Albert
Victor Nicholas Mount-
batten (nicknamed Dicky by
his shipmates at Dartmouth
Royal Naval College, be-
cause they said he seemed
to have every other name
but that) has certainly never
been orthodox himself.
He specialised as a signal-
officer, and produced in his
own hand most of the first draft
of the original Naval wireless-
manual. He wanted to learn
to play polo and set about
doing so by publishing that
anonymous classic Polo, by
“Marco.” He went to war
and saw that the only way
for the Allies to win was by
them becoming “triphibious”
—land, sea and air forces
working together as a team
under a supreme commander
who thought triphibiously
himself. And he carried his
principles into effect with a
serenity which belies the ruth-
less, questing, ceaseless effici-
ency that drives him in every-
thing he does.
The war won in South-east
Asia, he set-about handing-
over to the “cricket-team” of
11 separate Governments who
took charge of the area he had
administered. Whether his
choice there was always right,
as again whether his action
in India was, is for history to
judge when all the factors
affecting the issues can be dis-
closed.
But he is a man guided by
strong principles, and these,
with a deep sense of the
importance of history, lead his
mind to find its own solutions.
It’s a delight to see him set
about tackling any problem,
and, if sometimes privileged to
be told the reason for his
action, to follow the logical
process of his thought, as it
reaches the conclusion he
ultimately evolves. At least
one learns that to him nothing
is impossible, and becomes
astounded at the width of
vision and yet the grasp of
detail that the human mind
can assimilate.
T think the principles that
guide him were taught him
by his father. Prince Louis of
Battenberg, First Sea Lord of
the British Admiralty, was an
officer that old seamen still
talk about with bated breath.
“I saw him, Prince Louis,
bring his First Cruiser Squad-
ron into the Grand Harbor at
Malta. Like horse-soldiers,
those ships was, each in her
proper station. Gawd iumme,
what a sea-off’cer he was. If
his son’s like him he’ll be
worth something.”
An old seaman said this to
me when I went to the London
Customs House to redeem a
bundle of surrendered Japanese
swords sent back from Singa-
pore.
I heard again in a differ-
ent voice: “I was in the North
Sea early in the war in my first
important command in action.
There was gunfire away off
course, heavy guns, more than
I’d got in the Kelly. A dirty
night and fog over the Dogger.
I didn’t know what to do and
thought what my father had
taught me: ‘Whenever you
hear gunfire, go straight to-
wards it!’ It rang in my mind
as plain as an order ; I altered
course and went towards the
guns, and how my ship’s com-
pany must have cursed me! We
got there —it was one of our
own cruisers at target-practice.
An anticlimax, perhaps, but I
had justified my father’s
words.”
Prince Louis—there was a
painting of him in the London
office, bearded, standing
against a background of raging
seas —who kept the Grand
Fleet mobilised on his own
initiative after the summer
manoeuvre in 1914 because he
feared war with Germany and
who so saved England, but who
was too great a man for the
English Lords. They could
not appreciate that loyalty to
a Service and to an adopted
country transcended nation-
ality. That wasn’t the view
of the lower-deck. “The best
since Nelson,” said my Cus-
tomsman.
Z"''ood example, worthily fol-
lowed. The lower-deck and
the “other ranks” worshipped
Lord Louis in the war, because
he was something unique,
someone who took the trouble
to talk to them in their own
language. Whether it was
Urdu, French, Dutch or just
plain barrackroom slang—he
would say what he had to say
in words men could under-
stand. It’s the idiom that
counts, and he can speak the
Doric as well as he can the
highfalutin phrases that diplo-
mats or politicians need.
He must be respected as a
man, because he follows the
Renaissance ideal on which
the best of our education still
is based. Possibly he is one
of the best living examples of
the complete man —as com-
petent to discuss electronics
with world authorities as to
fight a destroyer-action, or co-
ordinate a “triphibious” cam-
paign, or to govern a country,
or write a book.
/~\ne last vignette. After the
. end of War 11, Nehru (then
persona non grata ) decided to
come to Malaya to visit the
Indian community. The
Indian National Army said
they would line the streets of
Singapore wearing their pros-
cribed uniform. The Joint
Planning Staff (“orthodox”?)
were horrified. “No, this can-
not be allowed: there will be
a riot, possibly a civil emerg-
ency, and, look, we’ve only
got the Loamshires here to
deal with it and a few sailors
and erks. The police could
never cope. No, it cannot be
recommended.”
We wrote a memorandum
about it. Lord Louis read it
and said nothing beyond this:
“Let the poor b s wear
their uniform ; they’ve prob-
ably got no other clothes fit
to wear.”
The day of Nehru’s visit
came, and, from the Cathay
Building, we heard a roar of
shouting going on in the streets
below. Rushing to the bal-
cony of the eighth-floor, the
triphibious Joint Planning
Staff looked down with appre-
hension on what they imagined
might be the start of a fully-
fledged riot.
The streets were packed with
people Chinese, Malays,
Eurasians. All were cheering
their heads off. Nehru was
riding in an open car with
Lady Louis sitting beside him ;
Lord Louis and the A.D.C.
sat in the tip-up seats facing
them. The Indian National
Army (in uniform) cheered the
loudest,
HThe fact that Admiral of
the Fleet the Earl Mount-
batten of Burma, K.G., is to
become Britain’s Chief of
Defence Staff next July
brings hope of sense in
defence-planning. He knows
what he’s driving at and how
to get there. That’s been
proved time and again. More
than that he knows how to
tell other people what he
wants them to do and to get
them to do it together, as a
team. Not only in his own
country but men of every race
or religion. That has also
been proved. He thinks in
the future but bases his argu-
ments on truths learned in the
past. And his mind doesn’t
run in ordinary grooves.
Personally, I would loathe
to find myself fighting on the
opposite side to him!


CITIZENSHIP CONVENTION
IN opening the tenth annual Citizenship
Convention in Canberra last week the
Governor-General said that Aus-
tralia’s future depended more on the
scale and success of immigration than
on any other single factor; the country’s
need of population was as great as ever ;
the task vital and urgent. Defining the
objectives of immigration, Sir William
Slim said the two main ones were to
attract the right types of people in the
right numbers and to weave them into
the fabric of Australian life.
This is probably as good a definition
as could be given of the ideal aim of
immigration, though it leaves room for
much diversity of opinion in the matter
of interpretation. It is generally agreed
that this country needs population. What
is not so easy to reach unanimity upon
is the maximum number of new arrivals
that should be sought or admitted;
“right numbers” is a term that has vastly
different meanings for different people.
Almost as much difference of opinion
exists on the subject of right types.
What is a Right Type?
'T'here are some who urge that only
people of British stock should be
accepted ; others concede the necessity
for admitting European migrants, but
would confine the field of recruitment
to Northern Europe, on the grounds that
people from that region are more easily
assimilated than the Mediterranean
peoples. There is general agreement that
there should be no indiscriminate immi-
gration from Asia and an almost universal
acceptance of the White Australia policy
—though with increasing reluctance to
call it by that name. There is, however, a
fairly vocal agitation for a quota-system
for Asian migrants, the advocates of such
a system holding that it would make for
better relations between Australia and
the Asian countries. Since, however, the
advocates of the quota usually stress that
it shall be small, and generally seem to
be thinking in terms of university-
educated migrants, it is hard to see how
such a system would have the desired
effect of winning friends in Asia. Most
Asian countries are striving desperately
to increase their stock of trained and
qualified men ; they are not likely to feel
inspired with hearty friendship towards
a country which seduces away their
brightest young people while refusing to
accept their f.a.q. citizens, much less their
unskilled laborers.
The second of the two objectives the
Governor-General lays down for a
successful immigration policy—the weav-
ing of the migrants into the fabric of
Australian life—is largely dependent on
the first —the attraction of the right types
in the right numbers. It is obvious that
migrants from the United Kingdom,
sharing with us a common language, a
common system of law and government
and largely a common history and tradi-
tions should fit most easily into the
Australian pattern. After all, it was
from Britain that the people who made
the pattern came. At the end of World
War II more than 97 per cent, of Aus-
tralians were British by birth. From the
first years of settlement the overwhelming
proportion of new arrivals hailed from
the United Kingdom, and the relatively
small number of European migrants
among them were assimilated into the
community without much difficulty.
Postwar immigration schemes have
brought more than a million new people
to Australia, including several hundred
thousand from a score of countries in
Europe. This has made assimilation a
national problem where before it was
merely a personal one.
Assimilation or Integration?
"Cor this reason assimilation was the
main topic of discussion at last week’s
convention ; the three main papers
delivered dealt with various aspects of it.
Sir Macfarlane Burnet spoke on “Migra-
tion and Race-mixture From the Genetic
Angle”; Nevil Shute on “The Future
Population of Australia” and Titia and
G. J. van Keulen on “Assimilation or
Integration.”
Mr. van Keulen, a Dutch engineer who
came to Australia in 1951, favors the
term “integration” rather than “assimila-
tion,” and he is quite right. Assimilation
conjures up a picture of a boa-constrictor
swallowing an antelope or a cannibal
tribe absorbing a missionary. Integration
is closer to the Governor-General’s
metaphor of weaving the newcomer into
the national fabric.
Mr. van Keulen feels qualified to
speak of integration, as his own country
has for centuries been a receiving-ground
for migrants who for political or other
reasons have had to leave their own lands.
These were integrated rather than
assimilated. They didn’t merely adopt
the ways and customs of their adopted
country; they brought something witlr
them, and the Dutch gained too.
Integration could be more or less classi-
fied as a two-way traffic. It is not solely
the migrant who will have to take over
the Australian way; but the Australian will
also need to adjust hrimself. And that is
what we see happening more and more.
Growth of Tolerance
Speaking from experience (which in his
case has turned out happily, but in
other cases less fortunately) he asks for
tolerance towards newcomers. He claims
that the first year or two are decisive in
determining whether the migrant will
really become an Australian or whether
he will be a stranger in this country for
the rest of his life. In the eight years he
has been in Australia Mr. van Keulen
has noticed a growth of tolerance in Aus-
tralians ; a greater willingness to wel-
come the newcomer. If this observa-
tion is valid and not merely a sign that
Mr. van Keulen himself has become more
Australianised in the meantime, it is
very gratifying. In her paper Mrs. van
Keulen, speaking from the woman’s
angle, also discussed integration.
Nevil Shute was not so much concerned
with what is going to happen to the
migrants now arriving as with the
problem of where we are to get our
migrants in a few years’ time. His con-
clusion was that only the United States
—with an annual population-increase of
a million —would be able to supply them.
For the present he felt that both the
quality and quantity of migrants would
fall off unless something was done to
make the transition period less painful.
In this he particularly referred to hous-
ing.
Genetic Effects
TThe paper that provoked most discus-
sion at the convention—and in the
press and on radio —was that of Sir Mac-
farlane Burnet. Discussing the genetic
effects of migration he said it was fantas-
tically wrong to think of maintaining
“pure breeds.” Healthy parents of
different race could produce healthy
children no matter how extreme the
difference between the parents. He
accepted the fact that “there will always
be mating-groups in the community,”
but he urged that these groups should
be made as wide, as fluid and as variable
as possible. It was at this stage that
Professor Burnet made the statement that
has been seized upon as though it were
the keynote of his whole address instead
of merely a natural scientific corollary to
his main proposition. Remarking that
“from the genetic angle there is much to
be said for allowing into the country as
much non-European genetic material
as the community can safely assimilate,”
he urged that “the practical approach
would be to establish a rule that the
spouse of any Australian citizen of
European blood is automatically admis-
sable to citizenship irrespective of race
or nationality.”
This has been taken in some quarters
as an outright attack on the White Aus-
tralia policy. This is hardly fair. What
Burnet suggests is already being done in
individual cases as an act of grace. He
merely suggests making it a rule. He does
not advocate planned immigration of
non-Europeans. Indeed, he says,
Experience everywhere indicates that it
would be disastrous to open the doors to
a large dissimilar minority introduced to
provide cheap, lower-grade labor.
In advocating marriages between non-
European students working in Australia
and Australians of European stock he
seems to be speaking as the complete
geneticist, without regard for other facets
of the problem. “However,” he con-
cludes,
the important feature is surely to make the
most of the genetic diversity that has come
to us from Europe and the British Isles,
and will continue to come in future years
On the whole we are on safe ground
if we strive both to bring about the full
cultural absorption of all migrant groups
and in the process make it easier for an
increasing proportion of marriages to take
place outside their own racial group.

also lift the A.J.C. Challenge
Stakes. He did this in easy
fashion from 100-to-l Gay
Coin and 66-to-l Heavenly
Star. Huntly’s rider, Neville
Sellwood, also won the Chal-
lenge two years ago on My
Kingdom. Huntly’s 1.1 li was
average for the Challenge, in
which the two previous
winners, Dubbo and My King-
dom, both broke 1.10 for the
six furlongs. Huntly was
backed from 5-to-l to 7-to-2.
Gold Stakes, at odds-on,
flopped in the Challenge
Stakes, but his chance wasn’t
helped when his jockey, M.
Schumacher, elected to play
cut-throat with another speed-
ster, New Spec, whose race-
form has been poor. The
tearaway tactics made the race
easy for Huntly. Gold Stakes,
regarded generally as a racing
“certainty” for the Challenge,
finished fourth and New Spec
last. When two leaders go
hammer and tongs in the front
they generally crack-up when
the final stage is reached. This
happened in the Challenge.
Parabola filled four minor
places before her initial win
in the A.J.C. Sledmere Maiden
Handicap for fillies. It was a
fine effort, because the daughter
of Pan II (Fr.) and Parra-
matoo not only carried top
weight (8.11) but drew the
'outside barrier - position.
Jockey G. Podmore had the
filly near the lead all the way
and she finished down the
centre of the track for a well-
deserved first success. Parra-
matoo, by Midstream (imp.),
has proved a successful brood
mare, her other progeny in-
cluding Queen Nilo, Paranilo
and Prince Ranier.
Mainbrace was a crack New
Zealander —undisputed cham-
pion of his time. He started
25 times for 23 wins and two
minor placings, and earned
£29,985 in stakes. Seventeen
of his Wins were consecutive.
Few horses have won that
many races on end. However,
the progeny of Mainbrace have
yet to make their mark on the
turf. ' Not many have been
tried and few of them have
raced in Australia. One which
could keep Mainbrace’s name
in the headlines is Rum Issue,
which seems aptly named.
Rum Issue hadn’t had a run
with the colors up before
Saturday last at Randwick,
when he defeated 15 others in
the Sunnyside Two-year-old
Maiden Handicap for colts and
geldings. It was an impres-
“I always Wanted to be a big-game hunter , but
business kept me in the city."
sive debut. The son of Main-
brace and St. Brigid cost
1150gns. as a yearling at the
Dominion sales last year. St.
Brigid is by Gold Nib (imp.)
from Duvach by Foxbridge
(imp.). As Rum Issue is
related to Hiraji (Melbourne
Cup) and to Mac’s Amber
(Toorak Handicap and Alister
Clark Stakes) he is well
credentialled.
Eight yearlings by the new
imported sire Alpenhorn were
catalogued for the latest N.Z.
auction, and some of them will
be racing in Australia after
August next. Alpenhorn won
half-a-dozen races in England
from seven furlongs to 11-
miles 132yds. He is by the
noted staying sire Alycidon,
winner of 11 races and £37,200
in stakes from one mile to
two - miles five - furlongs. M.
Grogan, acting for a Sydney
owner, paid 2000gns. on the
final sale-day for a chestnut
colt by Alpenhorn from
Colorado Maid.
Next Wednesday (Feb. 4) at
Canterbury Park the roar of
the ring will be silenced —for
that’s the date set for the
opening S.T.C. fixture without
bookmakers. Chairman Harry
Tancred has announced that
preparations are well in hand
for the initial all-tote meet-
ing at which paddock charges
for men will be reduced from
14s. to 10s. and for women
from 7s. to ss. Leger admis-
sion fees will not be altered.
The club will revert to the ss.
doubles and quinellas, a move
smaller punters, especially the
ladies, have eagerly awaited.
Stake-money will be increased
by £5O for each race. The
chairman stressed that no sec-
tion of racing had more to
gain from the new scheme than
trainers. Punters’ reaction to
all-tote wagering should be
interesting.
As often happens when a
trainer starts two horses in the
same race, the lesser-fancied
finishes ahead of the stable-
mate. Randwick mentor R. W.
Roden started Prince Dante
(third) and Treasured Link
(first) in the eight-horse field
for the A.J.C. January Handi-
cap. He preferred Prince
Dante’s chance, and that geld-
ing started at 10 to 1, firming
from 14’s, while Treasured
Link eased from 12’s to 33’s.
Prince Dante was taken to the
front, opened-up a big lead,
and was followed by Treasured
Link, which, however, took the
lead in the straight and won
by a nose from the odds-on
favorite Ulandra with Prince
Dante a good third.
Gay Coin, rank outsider and
runner-up to Huntly in the
A.J.C. Challenge Stakes, has
the Newtown Wonder speed,
and at his only prior Sydney
start was narrowly beaten at
Canterbury by Robin Tout,
also an outsider in the betting.
Gay Coin was in- second place
most of the way on that
occasio.n, and his apprentice
rider, Keith Smith, kept him
near the leaders in the
Challenge Stakes. As he can
compete in Novice class he
should quickly win in that
company.. Gay Coin realised
900gns. as a yearling at the
1957 Randwick auction. His
dam, Gay Courtship, won at
Gosford and Wyong, and is
by Agincourt (imp.) from Gay
Colleen by Le Grand Due
(Fr.).
• • • •
Game Trail, winner of the
Hawkesbury Two-year-old
Maiden Handicap for fillies, is
aptly named. She is by Rego
(imp.) from Kokoda by
Felcrag (imp.). Costing
400gns. as a yearling at the
Randwick auction, the filly is
a half-sister to Markham,
winner of more than a dozen
races in N.S.W. country dis-
tricts and in Victoria. She
comes from the family which
produced a Sydney Cup
winner, Talisman, and Mid-
wise, winner of several sprints,
including the A.J.C. Gimcrack
stakes.
Rosebery trainers expected
that little-raced Dagger would
not be troubled to win his first
race, the Hawkesbury First
Maiden Handicap, because
the four-year-old gelding by
Careless from Steel Flash had
easily defeated opponents on
the training-track. Dagger
could quickly add to his first
success. Later in the day at
Hawkesbury, W. E. Crockett,
who trains Dagger, won the
First Improvers’ Handicap
with Smile, which he recently


added to his team. Smile has
had many trainers.
Akbar, N.Z. winner at two
miles and runner-up Jo Delta
in the 1951 Melbourne Cup,
and Ammon Ra, a top per-
former of earlier years, figure
in the family-lines of Lost
River, winner of the A.J.C.
Twilight Novice mile-and-a-
quarter, so it is no wonder the
four-year-old son of Belvedere
(imp.) and Floodstream can
stay. Lost River is a smart
track-galloper and had pre-
viously won at Hawkesbury
and at Cootamundra. He had
also finished fourth to Lady
Cortauld at Randwick, a
pointer to his success at the
mid-week fixture. Brisbane
jockey N. Birrer rode a better-
judged race on Lost River
than he had done at the horse’s
previous start.

Melbourne Racing
It has been a long time be-
tween wins for Maori Gold,
which won the 10-furlongs
Mitchell Handicap at Caulfield
last Saturday. In fact his pre-
vious success was in the same
event 12 months before. He had
run some poor races between
those wins, and the crowd put
on a rather unpleasant demon-
stration against the Sabaean
gelding as he came back to
scale. However, Maori Gold
has been getting down in the
weights and, with his young
rider Des Lake claiming 71b.,
the gelding carried only 7.11.
It was the first winning race in
the city for Lake, who has,
however, done plenty of
country riding—he has ridden
29 winners “in the bush.”
Maori Gold is a front
runner, and Lake showed
sound knowledge of pace to
ride the gelding quietly in front
to the turn, where he kicked
him away to a winning break.
He should do well in the game
unless his love of farming
takes priority. The Mitchell
Handicap showed one thing—
that Vogel, winner of three
races recently, cannot get much
more than a mile. Vogel
weakened badly in the run
home.

The unwanted title of
unluckiest horse racing in Mel-
bourne must go to the New-
town Wonder two-year-old
filly Kerkeri, which was nosed
out of the five-furlongs King-
ston Stakes by the good Star
Kingdom filly Ritmar at Caul-
field. Kerkeri has been placed
six times in metropolitan races
but is still a maiden. Ritmar
is very speedy, and her owner
Mrs. L. R. Buxton, intends to
start her in the five-furlongs
w.f.a. Lightning Stakes at
Flemington next month.
Misting won this race last
year as a two-year-old, and
that success has stayed in the
minds of several Melbourne
trainers with good two-year-
olds. They argue that, over
five furlongs, a speedy
youngster can match strides
with older horses. It is likely
there will be three or four two-
year-olds in the Lightning field
this year. Ritmar has been a
most consistent filly with two
wins and four seconds from
six starts. Sydney racegoers
may see her in the Sires’
Produce Stakes.
Melbourne’s heat wave —the
mercury on Saturday scored its
fifth century in eight days—
drove a wedge into tradition
at Caulfield. Members were
advised over the course ampli-
fiers that they could remove
tfieir coats —provided they did
not display braces, and kept a
tie on. Racegoers in the public
enclosures looked moi'e like
a beach crowd, with a good
many in shorts and floral shirts
unbuttoned to the waist.
It is remarkable the number
of times a horse wins the same
race in successive years. Maori
Gold did it at Caulfield on
Saturday when he won his
second Mitchell Handicap, and
later in the programme High
Gun won the s|-furlongs
Barton Handicap (second divi-
sion) for the second year in a
row. There was not much
for High Gun to beat on Satur-
day, but he had to give away
a lot of weight, and he won
easily enough.
There is every chance that
Ron Hutchinson will win the
Victorian jockeys’ premiership
this year for the first time,
despite the fact that he will
probably accept a lucrative
offer to ride in Malaya during
the winter months. With a win
on Dow Street at Caulfield he
completed a double which
made his tally for the season
3H wins. He has a lead of
11 over Geoff Lane and is
likely to be far enough in front
when he leaves for Malaya to
hold his lead to the end of the
season. The mile Griffith
Handicap was a first city win
for Dow Street, whose only
other success was a small race
at Woodend last month ; but
the Wayside Inn gelding,
which cost 400gns. as a
yearling, is on the improve.
Those racegoers who look
for omens in their search for
winners probably had an
interest in Burning Embers,
winner of the first heat of the
Barton Handicap at Caulfield.
It would be hard to find a
better “tip” in the fiery con-
ditions. A four-year-old
Djafar mare, Burning Embers
has tons of speed, and the sj-
furlongs of the Barton
journey suited her nicely. She
will tackle the rich Oakleigh
Plate over the same course and
distance next month. She will
find that a much harder race to
win than the Barton. Frank
Treen, mentioned here last
week as riding in great form,
rode Burning Embers.
Prince Dahomey must be an
expensive gelding for his con-
nections. Over recent weeks,
he has run some good races in
open company without
winning, and yet found it
beyond him to run up to that
form when he gets in weak
trial company. Twice lately,
including the Deakin Trial at
Caulfield, won by Great Singer,
he has gone out a hot favorite
in poor company, but failed
to land the money. The
answer seems to be that he
cannot carry weight. There is
not a harder type of race to
pick a winner than a trial where
the scale of weights makes it
difficult to evaluate form
accurately.
Melbourne racing will get a
welcome lift in class with the
running of the w.f.a. C. F.
Orr Stakes at Caulfield next
Saturday. It should see another
interesting tussle between old
rivals Lord and Prince Darius.
Reports suggest that Prince
Darius may be a better horse
than ever this time up, and he
may find the seven furlongs
of the Orr Stakes ideal.

The Trots
In winning the £6OOO Harold
Park Cup on Friday night in
record time from the 36yds.-
behind mark, N.Z. champion
Caduceus put up a remark
able performance—perhaps the
best ever seen on the Harold
Park track. Starting at 20 to 1
he beat 5-to-2 second-favorite
Fettle (12yds. behind) by two
lengths, with Diabolo Don
(12yds. behind) a further \\
length away third.
Caduceus was last for the
first two laps and only eighth
coming to the bell. Respond-
ing brilliantly to Kersley’s
driving, Caduceus raced into
fourth position behind First
Kiss (which had led almost
throughout), Fettle and Diabolo
Don with half a lap to go.
Fettle had a narrow lead from
First Kiss, with Caduceus
ranging up on the outside, as
the three rounded the bend into
the home stretch. Sustaining
his run Caduceus gradually
drew away to pass the post
amid a tumultuous ovation
from the 20,000-odd people
present. First Kiss (6-to-4-on
favorite) weakened into sixth
position behind Malniri and
Sibelia.
Caduceus ran the 13 furlongs
98yds. in the record time of
3min. 30sec., recording a mile
rate of 2.5. Standing only
13 hands Caduceus was
the smallest horse in the race.
He has now won £42,600 in
prizemoney. After competing
in the £IOOO Invitation Stakes
at Harold Park on Saturday
next, he will be set for
the £IO,OOO Inter-Dominion
Championship, first heats of
which will be run on the Mel-
bourne Showground on
Feb. 21.
Gorrelate, starting favorite
at 5 to 4 and driven by J. C.
Caffyn, put up a grand per-
formance to win the final of
the £2OOO Summer Handicap
(13 furlongs, 98yds.) in 3 min.,
37fsec., the second-fastest
time of the night. It was his
sixth successive win. Racing
one wide outside the pace-
maker, Warrigal, until about
three furlongs from home,
Caffyn drove Gorrelate hard
when challenged by Flingo.
Going to the front in the
straight, Gorrelate was going
away at the post to beat Flingo
by three-quarters of a length,
with Colonist the same distance
away third.

The Cricketers
Talking-point in the selection
of the Australian team for the
fourth Test, which begins in
Adelaide on Friday, is the
recall of former express Ray
Lindwall. Many thought the
Australian selectors had written
Lindwall off, though he has
fully earned his recall by some
sterling efforts with the ball
for Queensland last season and
this —such as his 5-57 against
the M.C.C. last November and
the 7-92 in searing heat
against S.A. which clinched his
selection.
When Hutton’s team was
here in 1954-55 Lindwall,
though picked for all the Tests
(he played in four), looked to


have lost most of his sting.
In the fifth Test that season in
Sydney, there was seen the
previously unknown spectacle
of fieldsmen placed all around
the boundary while he was
bowling. In that fifth Test
Lindwall brought up his 100
wickets in Tests against Eng-
land —though his 100th looked
to be a “presentation.” When
he still had only 99 Wardle
skied a ball which Davidson
(of all fieldsmen) dropped, but
then Bailey, in most un Bailey-
like fashion, didn't lay a stroke
to a straight ball which would
most likely have been, with
Hutton closing, the last bail
of the innings. Lindwall
didn’t do much in England in
1956.
Lindwall now gets his last
chance to beat Clarrie
Grimmett’s Australian record
of taking 216 wickets in Tests.
Lindwall at present has taken
212. Grimmett played in 37
Tests (22 v. England) com-
pared with Lindwall’s 55 (27
v. England). Alec Bedser took
236 wickets in 51 Tests (21 v.
Australia), the greatest wicket-
taker in Test history.
Another Queenslander now
making a bid to return to the
Test-team is batsman Peter
Burge, whose recent knocks up
to Queensland’s first-innings
against Victoria have been 171,
101 (against S.A.), 40 and 57
not-out against W.A! (the 57
in fast time, with his team
chasing the runs) and 41 and
11 against N.S.W. He was
somewhat unluckily given out
“handled the ball” in that
innings of 11, when N.S.W.
seemed to be playing the game
“the hard way.” Burge’s last
three successive innings against
Victoria have yielded 135, 210
(in the two 1956-57 Shield
games) and 171. Burge also
ranks as one of the best
throwers-in of the ball from
the outfield—over the stumps
almost every time.

“Veryl”: Sydney “Sun-
Herald” (18/1/’59) reported
briefly that Herb Elliott had
been beaten in an 880yds.
inter-club race in Melbourne
the day before. Wrong—it was
Herb's younger brother,
Laurie, who was thus beaten.
Though finishing second,
Laurie Elliott made a good
impression in his Melbourne
debut, and is considered by
some judges to have as good
a potential at his present age,
18, as had brother Herb. On
Nov. 1 last year, in Perth’s
inter-school titles, Laurie ran
the 880yds. in lmin. 56.85ec.,
to clip o.2sec. off a record held
by Herb.

“Zorok” on a couple of
still-active (or not-so-active)
world champs:
At Sydney Stadium a week or so
ago, on one of Sydney’s hottest
nights this summer, two gentlemen,
the molars of both of whom are
now somewhat lengthy, wrestled
until the younger but more moun-
tainous of the two (21st. odd) was
disqualified. The two were 61-year-
old Greek Jim Londos and 53-year-
old Italian Primo Camera.
The “young-'un” incurred the
ref.’s displeasure in the fifth round
lor pushing him in the face —which
must have been the most welcome
gift then possible to be brought to
the Greek, who looked as if he
might not last too much longer.
I haven’t got Londos’s full
wrestling record, but according to
the 1939 Miller’s he defeated Jim
Browning for the world heavyweight
wrestling championship at Madison
Square Garden (New York) on
June 25, 1934, and, in Philadelphia
in Jan., 1939, defeated Broncho
Nagurski for the same title. I
understand he won the world title
for the first time in 1930, also
defended his title against the
redoubtable “Strangler” Lewis in
Chicago in 1935, and defended his
title against Fred Atkins in Sydney
in 1946 —don’t know whether or
not that was his last title-defence.
Primo, of course, is more famous
as having once been world heavy-
weight boxing champion. He won
that title early in 1933 by defeating
the Lithuanian, Jack Sharkey
(whose real name was John
Cocoskey); he twice successfully
defended it —though in both fights
he was up against veterans long
past their best. In 1934 Max Baer
easily relieved him of the crown,
stopping the Ambling Alp in the
11th round.
Denzil Batchelor, in his Big Fight
(1954), has described Camera as
“the only freak to hold the heavy-
weight championship, a genuine
circus strong man promoted into a
fighter.” Since his defeat by Baer,
“his sheer size,” to quote Batchelor
again, “has stood him in good stead
m cacch-as-catch-can wrestling and
in films w'here mere antiquity is no
bar to success.” The Londos-
Carnera b’out certainly proves the
correctness of this latter statement
of Batchelor’s, in relation to
wrestling at any rate.
Faith in the
Future
Some wonderful equipment is available these
days for all types of modern construction.
We have only to look around us to see what is
being applied mechanically in the raising of
buildings and the laying of roads.
My friend Mr. J. R. Munro summarised it
admirably in an interesting paper he delivered
recently in -Scotland when he said: “Mechanical
power is here to replace muscle.”
He is Caterpillar’s director of manufacturing
in Britain, and an authority on his subject.
In this paper he dealt particularly with
machines for road-making ; machines so enormous
that they can pick up the equivalent of a
small house, lift tons of material more than a
hundred feet in the air and place the load delicately
where it is required; machines that can take in,
chew up, and treat raw materials for the making and
finishing of roads.
I saw some of these latest units at work during
my recent travels overseas. It is amazing to watch
them do everything from the first breaking of the
surface to the final paving.
The range of modern machinery of this kind
is too wide to attempt a listing here. But I agree
with Mr. Munro that the backbone of any fleet of
construction equipment is the tractor.
It is so very versatile. With proper attachments
it can pull, push, dig, load, hoist, and perform many
other functions.
The purpose of all such equipment is to raise
efficiency and economise in time and cost.
And 1 mention it now because it has a decided
connection with the Faith we express in Australia
through the quick provision of roads to match our
industrial and economic expansion.
Underlying all our planning of roads for the
future is the need for employing to the utmost the
astonishing pov/er and usefulness of labor-saving
and work-speeding machinery.
Australia, with its limited skilled manpower
for works of every kind, must turn more and more
to machines that will “multiply the muscles
of men.”

RUSSIAN ROCKETRY
T>RITISH and U.S. editorial
thoughts on the Soviet’s
successful launching of “Planet
Ten”:
“New York Times” : “What
has now been proved for the
first time by this rocket is a
fact of central importance: It
is possible for man-made
rocket-engines to achieve speeds
sufficient to propel large masses
of human artifacts far enough
away from our planet so that
the gravitational pull of the
earth becomes relatively minor
and the objects launched can
shift to movement under the
primary influence of the gravi-
tational pull of other bodies
in the solar system. Put
another way, this feat has
shown that the sending of
rockets to the moon and to at
least our nearest planetary
neighbors, Mars and Venus, is
entirely feasible in the years
immediately ahead. Man’s
exploration of the solar system
has begun.”
* * *
London “Time and Tide” :
“Russia’s peaceful shot at the
moon is regarded with awe,
especially from the United
States, because such target-
practice has an undeniably
boastful element to it. Like
some sharpshooter picking-off
a daisy or two to impress his
next victim, the Russian moon-
rocket was a most efficient way
of showing that accuracy and
power are equally important
in Russian technological eyes.
If it is assumed that the
launchers aimed for the moon’s
centre, they only missed a
target moving 230,000 miles
away at 2000 m.p.h. by a mere
4660 miles. Translated into
intercontinental-ballistic-missile
terms this means that those
on Manhattan cannot rely any
more upon the traditional
picture of bad Russian equip-
ment, poorly manufactured
and crudely put together.
Soviet rocketry is an exact
science, and obviously the
missile being used to throw up
these giant sputniks and inter-
planetary vehicles is a lot
bigger than anything at present
in the American armory.”
* * *
London “Economist” : “The
Soviet scientists knew that [the
rocket] would escape the
earth’s puli, but they remained
cagey about what exactly it
was meant to do. ‘Shoot first
and answer questions after-
wards’ is still the custom in
Moscow. The rocket settled
the issue by skirting the moon
at a close distance of 4660
miles and going into orbit
round the sun. It thus becomes,
its admirers say, ‘Planet Ten,’
although with its sodium flare
exhausted and its radio-
batteries dead, it is now as use-
less to man as any other
asteroid. The Soviet rocketeers
have proved their ability to
send up a final-stage missile of
a weight and speed well above
anything the Americans have
achieved, and with a disturbing
accuracy of aim. Had they
been thinking seriously of
orbiting round the sun, how-
ever, they would presumably
have equipped the rocket with
solar batteries.”
* * *
London ‘‘Daily Express” :
“The success shows that the
Russians may soon be able to
deliver the most powerful
missiles with unexampled
accuracy. By virtue of their
strategic bomber-force the
Americans are still the more
powerful nation —today. But
within the next decade the
Russians could surpass them.
The lessons for Britain are un-
mistakable :
“The policy of her Govern-
ments must continue to be
based on rocklike support of
the American alliance. And her
people must show renewed
determination to develop
British missiles and build up
nuclear stockpiles. So that
Britain can face the challenge
of this new era with confidence
and strength.”
* * *
London “Daily Telegraph” :
“So long as the International
Geophysical Year was with us,
some pretence of international
co-operation in rocketry and
some effort towards it was
made. Within two days of its
ending the Soviet moon-rocket
was launched without warning,
without seeking the co-opera-
tion of Jodrell Bank. Before
that the Atlas from Cape
Canaveral had one up, also
without warning or exchange
of information, the Americans
having made it clear that this
project had-nothing to do with
I.G.Y. And before them were
the less secretive sputniks. We
who watch this duel growing
in intensity may well ask how
much longer it is to go on
without rules of any kind. Will
it be possible to get simple
principles of law agreed
between nations dealing with
the use of space? Or shall we
see missiles sent up to knock
other missiles down? How
will the peaceful and potential
war uses of space be recon-
ciled?”
* * *
“Manchester Guardian” :
“What comes next? Obviously
the Russian rocket is not the
last in the field. Even if the
Russians were content the
Americans will now feel bound
to show that they can do
better. The corridors of Wash-
ington will again be ringing
with talk of ‘crash programmes’
as they were when the first
sputnik went up. There will
be more rockets which do
much the same as the Russian
rocket, and very soon there
will be rockets that make a
landing on the moon and
rockets that reach out to Mars
and Venus. It will not be
much more than a decade
before someone now
probably a boy at school —is
eventually persuaded to put his
life in the hands of the rocket
and electronics engineers. We
have to recognise now that the
exploration of space (at least
within the solar system) by
rocket instrument and by

“It must be remembered that
the moon could form either a
base for further travel and
investigation into outer space,
or it could form a military
outpost from which ballistic
missiles could be launched
against the earth. Because of
the moon’s much lower gravi-
tational pull it would require
far less power to fire rockets
from the moon to the earth
than it would to fire a com-
parably sized intercontinental

mobilise its ideas and re-
sources. It will be facing a
country shocked by the severity
of the economic decrees. How-
ever sound in themselves, they
have yet to be accepted, even
half-heartedly, by the majority
of Frenchmen. The all-round
increases in rail, postal and
telephone charges; in rents,
in the price of gas and elec-
tricity ; bread and groceries,
wine and cigarettes, are felt to
be alarmingly heavy. But the
full effect of the new taxation,
both direct and indirect, can-
not be experienced for some
months. Meanwhile, French
opinion does not seem to have
been much impressed by the
other measures increases in
the minimum wage, in unem-
ployment benefits and in old-
age pensions—designed to pro-
tect the poorest sections of the
community.
“Here the test will be double.
For its part, the Government
will have to be not only
persuasive and resolute, but
also —and above all —impartial
in its allocation of burdens.
Failure at any poinf may well
induce a series of strikes which
would not only wreck any
chance of stabilising the French
economy but also resurrect the
political disunity which has
been the curse of France for
generations.”
* * *
“Manchester Guardian” :
“Though rebellion and disin-
tegration brought him in, there
can be no doubt that the new
President now comes to office
with the support of the great
majority of the French people.
It is, indeed, the weakness of
the new Cpnstitution, of de
Gaulle himself, and of France,
that nobody can see an alter-
native to him.”
The same: “We may worry
over much that has happened
in France in the past year: but
who can doubt that it would
have been much worse if
General de Gaulle were not
(for all his sometimes baffling
self-identification with France)
an uncommonly upright and
selfless man? And although
virtue in great men may some-
times go before a fall if it is
linked with political imper-
cipience, the General has so
far shown himself more often
shrewd than blundering. He
faces grave problems. It is still
not clear that he can reconcile
the pursuit of national great-
ness with the health of the
economy or that he will be able
(in his own words) to impose,
if need be, a settlement that
allows Algeria to ‘develop her
personality by her own efforts.’
But we must wish him luck..”

Edinburgh “Scotsman ” :
“With any President but de
Gaulle, the Constitutional
development could be safely
predicted: power would pass
to the Assembly, and even the
.President’s power of dissolu-
tion would only be used at the
request of the Prime Minister.
If all goes more or less well,
that is what may happen when
de Gaulle retires, unless some
other ‘great man’ appears on
the scene before then. As it
is, however, it is likely enough
that with the acquiescence of
the Assembly, a kind of
Presidential regime will
develop. The main parties will
be disarmed by the inclusion
of their leaders in the Govern-
ment. But the leaders, thus
removed from membership of
the Assembly, will be com-
mitted to de Gaulle. The ten-
dency towards a kind of Presi-
dential technocracy, which
might attempt, as in Algeria,
to substitute technical and
economic for political solu-
tions to the main problems
facing France, may become
stronger. Of course, a techno-
cracy always implies a policy
and presupposes political aims ;
political decisions are always
being made, if only by default.
“The danger is that extra-
parliamentary opposition
strikes, for example —and the
failure to end the Algerian
war will lead to more and yet
more ‘technical’ decisions with
profound political conse-
quences.”
* * *
“New York Times ” : “As his
[de Gaulle’s] powers of decree,
under which he ruled as emer-
gency Premier, begin to lapse,
and as France returns to a
more normal political life,
some of the divisions and
grievances begin to reassert
themselves. Thus the national
front which brought him to
power is falling apart with the
defection of the Socialists, and
rising prices caused by the
currency devaluation and new
taxation are causing new labor
unrest. In this situation the
Socialists can play a saving role
if they can absorb the loyal
opposition. But it will be the
task of the new Government
to complete its programme in
such a way as to avert a new
‘popular front’ between the
Socialists and the Communists
that could plunge France into
a new crisis.”

New York “Herald Tri-
bune" : “For once, the Presi-
dent of France will have some-
thing to say about his Minis-

such will not be a merry-go-

tuated with listless power
vacuums. No one can say how
well the new Constitution will
work or what the exact rela-
tionship between the legislative


and executive branches will
prove to be. But at least the
Government will have a head
on its body, and the head we
know to be a good one.”
Belgian Congo Riots
■p DINBURGH “S COTSMA N”
comment on the recent
anti-white riots in Leopoldville,
capital of the Belgian Congo:
“The riots are the most
severe symptom to date of the
discontent which has been
reported from time to time
over the past two years. The
Congo’s mineral wealth
uranium, copper, tin, manga-
nese —gave it a prosperity
which many other African
territories might envy. But the
fall in world prices has hit the
country severely.
“The level of unemployment
has risen sharply and led to
an increase in political agita-
tion. This has also been
stirred by the example of the
neighboring territories in
French West Africa, which are
now achieving internal auto-
nomy within the French Com-
munity, as well as Guinea and
Ghana, which have achieved
independence, and Nigeria,
which will shortly do so.
“The Belgian Government
was by no means unaware of
the need for political advance,
and a statement on the future
of the territory, which was
expected to hold out the pros-
pect of future autonomy, had
been scheduled.
“In some ways the regime in
the Congo has been a great
success. Until recently it had
a purely colonial Government,
neither Africans nor Euro-
peans having any political
rights. Rapid social progress
for the Africans —in the towns
at least and economic
advancement were made
possible by the revenue from
exports. At the lower and
technical levels, education for
Africans is outstanding. But
this was accomplished under a
paternal regime, which pro-
vided little or no opportunity
for training in politics or
administration. So long as
wages were high and employ-
ment healthy, it did not matter
much. But the complex of cir-
cumstances which has now
arisen makes the absence of a
well-developed political life all
the more dangerous. Colonial
political movements are im-
patient of paternalism any-
where, and what seems good
sense to European adminis-
trators often seems an in-
tolerable denial of rights to
the native politician. The first
important revelation of the
way things were going in the
Congo occurred two years ago
when elections were held in the
big towns. They were only
municipal elections, but a
nationalist group surprisingly
won an overwhelming victory
in the capital, and shortly after
issued a demand for immediate
self-government and freedom
of political expression.
“The future of the Congo
is bound to be profoundly
affected by developments in
West Africa. At the moment
the situation there is not un-
promising, though it may take
some time and a good deal of
conflict before all the ex-

colonial territories work out a

themselves and with their
former masters.”
United Germany?
Tn the course of a long
“Foreign Affairs” article on
“disengagement” in Europe,
George F. Kennan, former
U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet
Union, makes the interesting
point that some opponents to
linking West and East Germany
are more afraid of a united
Germany than they are of
Russia.
“Among those who are most
apprehensive about any dis-
cussion of the problem of dis-
engagement are those whose
minds are riveted less on the
danger of a permanent Soviet
control of Eastern Europe than
on the dangers of a possible
re-assertion of the power of
a united Germany in European
affairs.
“It would be wrong to
underestimate the number of
people, on both sides of the
Iron Curtain, and particularly
in some of the smaller Euro-
pean countries, who would
actually prefer the divided
Europe and divided Germany
of today to an undivided
Europe from which the forces
of the great non-European
powers would have departed
and in which a united
Germany, not bound by
exclusive and formal ties with
the West, could again play the
role of a great Power. There
are even those in Western
Europe who, in preference to
this latter alternative, would be
prepared to accept Soviet
hegemony over the entire
continent.
“It is not the purpose here
to reproach people for these
feelings, to question the
validity of the trauma from
which they proceed, or to deny
the magnitude of the un-
certainties that would be pro-
duced by any alteration of the
present status. Who is to
measure the monstrosity of
what took place between 1938
and 1945?
“In principle, the thesis of
German partition was not
without its force and its logic.
The German problem, in its
present dimension began with
the achievement of German
unification in 1870. The fear-
ful European wars of this
century have been th» expres-
sion of the failure to find—
and perhaps even the impos-
sibility of finding—any accept-
able place in a community of
fully sovereign European states
for a united Germany like-
wise fully sovereign.
“To the writer of these lines
it has seemed for many years
self-evident that a truly con-
structive European policy for
the post-war period could not
have as its goal merely another
attempt to fit a sovereign united
Germany into a system of
smaller European sovereignties
whom it was bound to out-
class in many vital manifesta-
tions of national energy.
“Germany could conceivably
go only one of two ways:
backward, by process of parti-,
tion, to a point where
sovereignty would be tolerable
because it was not united ; or
forward, toward membership
in a broader and higher system
of political loyalties—in some
sort of European federation,
where unification would be
tolerable because it was not
truly sovereign. But the first
alternative, plainly, was
anachronistic, politically im-
practical and pregnant with
possibilities for a re-enactment
of the unhappy past. In
the second lay the hope.
“There is, accordingly, no
disposition here to challenge
the proposition that a con-
structive future for a united
Germany is thinkable only
within the framework of a set
of international obligations
which would draw German
energies into channels broader
and more worthy than those
of the mere realisation of com-
petitive national ideals. The
questions at issue are only, first,
whether the framework to be
sought should be an exclusively
Western European one, and
should embrace only one
portion of Germany, or
whether it should be a general
European one, embracing all

of the German people and pre-
sumably some of the other
peoples of Central and Eastern
Europe as well; and, secondly,
if it is to be the latter, by what
stages one is to proceed in
this direction.
“If the eastern half of
Europe is not to become in
permanence a part of the
Russian empire, it would seem
obvious that the sights of
Western policy ought to be
set on the wider rather than the
more narrow concept. Elad
they been so oriented, this
would not have precluded the
development within Western
Europe of the immensely
valuable and hopeful institu-
tions of a European com-
munity, the growth of which
we have witnessed in recent
years. It would, however,
have put us on our guard
against developing these insti-
tutions in a way to prejudice
their eventual extension to the
entire continent or their
replacement by similar institu-
tions on a continental scale.
In particular, we would have
been warned against too close
an identification of these
institutions with military
arrangements applicable to
only a portion of the conti-
nent. If there is ever to be a
prospect of unlocking the great
political and military cramp by
which the life of the continent
is now restricted, a way will
have to be found to differen-
tiate sharply between the
military obligations of indi-
vidual continental countries to
extra-continental powers —the
means, that is, by which their
security is to be guaranteed, on
the one hand, and the
arrangements which may exist
among them for intimate
collaboration and even for the
bridging of the barrier of
sovereignty in economic and
technical fields, on the other.
“What has worried some of
us in recent years is.the impres-
sion that this distinction has
become increasingly blurred in
the formulation of Western
policies, and that the develop-
ment of the elements of com-
munity within the European
family—a process infinitely
important in principle to the
very prospects for the survival
and prosperity of European
civilisation —is occurring in
Western Europe in such a way
that only by the hopeless
device of general war or in the
unlikely event of a total
collapse of Russian power
could it conceivably be spread
to the remainder of the conti-
nent.
“Even if the validity of these
fears be accepted, there is,
admittedly, a further problem
of phasing. It was possible at
one time to suppose that it
might not be necessary to
regard the definition of Ger-
many’s supra-national obliga-
tions within the European
community as an integral part
of any initial agreement on
German unification and dis-
engagement of Europe ; it was
possible to suppose that the
change from a hopelessly
divided to a hopefully united
Europe might be carried out in
modest, tentative and easy
stages, whereby the creation
of German unity would pre-
cede the final definition of
Germany’s place and obliga-
tions within the European
family.
“The tenor of the debate
that has taken place within
the past year on the subject
of disengagement, and par-
ticularly the earnestness of the
fears revealed regarding any
German unification that would
operate to weaken Germany’s
present obligations to her
Western European neighbors,
suggests that this concept of
staging may have been wrong.
“Perhaps it is not realistic to
discuss German unification
and a possible modification of
Germany’s relation to the
Atlantic Pact without at the
same time specifying precisely
both the political guarantees
and strictures which would
affect a united Germany and
the supra-national institutions
in which she as well as any
other affected countries would
be embraced. It is possible, in
other words, that such pro-
blems as the formulation of a
general European security
pact, the future scope of the
institutions of the European
community, and probably even
the bitter question of Ger-
many’s eastern borders, may
have to be faced simulta-
neously with the first steps
towards a general disengage-
ment.
“One might hope that this
would not be so ; for if it is,
the whole approach to this
problem obviously becomes
more complex, more delicate,
more comprehensive in its
implications, more closely
related to the general problem
of the weapons-race and of
world-security than it would
otherwise be ; and the principle
of gradualness, essential per-
haps to any politically feasible
solution, is placed in question.
But the problem does not
thereby become theoretically
impossible of solution, nor is
its urgency thereby reduced.
If this must be the scope of the
discussion, so be it. But let
the discussion at least pro-
ceed.”

Feud
By DAL STIVENS
The feud between Mr.
Schmidt, the manager of
the Mundabilla branch
of the Bank of Sydney,
and Mrs. Jones, the wife of
the manager of the Bank of
Australia, was long standing.
Ostensibly, it had begun
because Mr. Schmidt drank,
but it really went deeper than
that. Mr. Schmidt's bank had
most of the best accounts in
the district and he was invited
to more of the “best homes”
of the squatters, including the
Bernard-Renshaws of Minoru
Station. The wealthy Bernard-
Renshaws banked with the
head-office in Sydney of
another bank, but both Mr-
Schmidt of the Bank of Sydney
and Mr. Jones of the Bank
of Australia were hopeful of
getting this big account.
Schmidt seemed to be lead-
ing. Every three weeks or so
he went to Minoru for the
weekend and shot ducks and
kangaroos with old Matthew
Bernard-Renshaw.
There was also the matter
of the visit of the State
Governor and his wife to
Mundabilla some months ago.
The Shire President, Councillor
Mullens, had given his Excel-
lency and his lady an official
dinner and had borrowed what
he considered the best residence
in town —not the Bank of
Australia but Mr. Schmidt’s
Bank of Sydney.
Schmidt, of distant German
immigrant descent, was a big
arrogant man with an eagle
nose. He was something of a
card, with more color than
the average bank-manager. He
played poker, drank more
whisky than was good for him,
liked the ladies, played a first-
class game of cricket, and was
a crack duck- and pigeon-shot.
He was a bachelor, aged 36.
Mrs. Pauline Jones was a
thin, restless woman with a
careful grand manner and un-
certain false teeth. She had
been a butcher’s daughter
before Cyril Jones married her.
Jones, a plumpish little man
with a stoop, was a capable
banker, but had no aptitude for
sport or good fellowship ; he
was pleasant, dull, inhibited
and a little pompous—a man
who would wear heavy blue-
serge suits with a waistcoat
even when the thermometer
went to 118 degrees and the
dust-clouds swept in from the
eroded mallee wheatlands that
girdled Mundabilla.
Schmidt, on those occasions,
got round in cream tussore suits
and often went about without
his coat, braving the cries of
small boys who had been
known to call “Ice-cream” after
him. He was quite a figure for
a country bank-manager. For
example, he bought one of the
first cars ever seen in Munda-
billa. This was a noisy Benz
which caused horses to bolt in
Main Street and so startled
' Councillor Mullens’s team
when he was ploughing that it
cleared out, over the top of
the startled Shire President.
The horses didn’t stop for
five miles and went through
23 fences.
After that the Shire Council
served an injunction on
Schmidt compelling him to
advise what route he would
be taking. This was, a little
optimistic, because the Benz
was always breaking down and
having to be towed back by an
agitated draught-horse.
Whenever Schmidt or the
Benz stopped, a crowd would
gather. Some of the lads round
town found it parked outside '
the Royal pub one night, tried
to start it up and failed. It
often wouldn’t start for
Schmidt. They got behind
and pushed it three miles along
the road to the next town.
After that Schmidt used
to padlock and chain it
wherever he parked it.
One day he had the Benz
ticking-over in the yard of the
bank and three of the locals
gathered around.
“Come for a spin?” Schmidt
asked.
They hopped in eagerly.
Schmidt slid into gear,
drove into the garage (formerly
a stable) and switched-off the
engine.
“That’s as far as I’m going
today,” he said.
A ll this happened just before
r *' the First World War.
Around Mundabilla were about
1000 blocks of 500 acres each,
where farmers grew wheat pre-
cariously on 15in. of rain a
year. To the north-east of
the wheatlands lay the rich
black-soil grazing-properties,
including the 50,000 acres of
Minoru.
The feud between Schmidt
and Mrs. Jones was undercover
at first ; Mrs. Jones merely
talking about Mr. Schmidt’s
drinking.
“My husband says Mr.
Schmidt is quite a capable
bank-manager ; it’s a pity he
drinks so much,” she’d say to
Mrs.' Shire President Mullens.
Or, “The Bank of Sydney has
built up a very good business
here, my husband says it
would be a pity if the bank
were to lose ground.”
In time Mr. Schmidt came to
hear of this. All he said at
first was, “Silly old trout. Cyril
ought to crown her some time.”
But one night when he w r as
drinking at the Royal with two
cronies he began brooding over
Mrs. Jones. And after a
further hour’s drinking he
was muttering, “Silly old trout!
She can’t do this to me.”
If was a hot night. When
Schmidt came out into the
street there were crowds in
the Greek cool-drink shops.
Men were sitting on the Post
Office steps, smoking and
yarning. In an upstairs room
above the jeweller’s shop on
the corner of Main and Bligh
Streets old Mrs. Wilson syas
going to bed with the windows
flung high to let in the air.
Wilson leaned over the bal-
cony and mopped his bald
head with his handkerchief.
Some time before morning a
cool breeze might spring up,
but just now there was no
wind: the brick buildings were
charged with the sun.
The two bank buildings
were on two diagonally oppo-
site corner sites where Main
and Bligh Streets crossed.
Wilson called out to Schmidt as
he passed below, walking in
the gutter, but Schmidt didn’t
hear. He was looking up to
the balcony of the Bank of
Australia building. He could
make out two figures sitting
there in the half-light from the
street. They were women and
were fanning themselves with
palm-leaf fans.
Schmidt crossed the road
and looked up.
“Go on, say it!” he said.
“Say it to my face. Say it.
Go on.”
Mrs. Jones came over to the
rail.
“Who is it?” she asked.
“You know who I am,”
Schmidt called out. “Go on,
say what you’re always saying
so I can hear it myself. Go
on!”
He stuck his chin out,
wrinkled his forehead and
glared angrily at her.
Mrs. Jones rallied from the
attack and said, in the tone
of voice she used to address
her yardman, “Mr. Schmidt,
you’re drunk.”
“I’m not drunk,” Schmidt
said firmly in what he thought
was a convincingly dignified
manner. “Mrs. Jones, I am not
drunk.”
“You are so drunk, Mr.
Schmidt, that you can hardly
stand up,” said Mrs. Jones.
KOOKABURRAS
I see we have undervalued the kookaburras;
They think they are waking the world, and l think so, too.
They gobble the night in their throats like purple berries,
They plunge their beaks in the tide of darkness and dew
And fish up long rays of light; no wonder now they howl
In such a triumph of trumpets, leaves fall from the trees,
Small birds fly backwards, snakes disappear in a hole.
And all day long they will rule the bush as they please.
Perched on high branches, one eye cocked for the snake,
From treetop to treetop they watch the sun and follow it ;
Far in the west they take it in that great beak
And bang it against a bluegum branch and swallow it;
Then nothing is left in the world but the kookaburras
Like waterfalls exulting down the gullies.
N.S.W.
Douglas Stewart.


Schmidt drew himself up
stiffly, swaying a little.
“I can walk as well as you
can,” he said.
“You’re drunk, Mr.
Schmidt,” Mrs. Jones insisted.
“In fact, you are so drunk you
can’t even stand- up, let alone
walk. You should be ashamed
of yourself.”
Schmidt now lost control and
bellowed with rage. He started
taking off his tussore coat.
“I’ll prove to you I’m not
drunk,” he said. “I’ll show you
I’m in possession of my
faculties. I’ll climb up the
post to your balcony.”
He lurched over to the post
and began to climb. Mrs.
Jones gaped down at him in
horror. A small crowd began
to gather in the street; Schmidt
got up 9ft. and then lost his
grip and came down, flailing
the air with his arms.
Mrs. Jones screamed.
Schmidt hit the ground
heavily, and when he was
helped to his feet they saw
that a nail had ripped the seat
of his pants. He gave out one
tentative bellow of rage and
allowed himself to be led away.
The fall had taken most of the
sting out of him.
Co the feud was in the open
after that. Mr. Jones made
a timid protest and retreated
before a threat of nose-pulling.
Mrs. Jones now talked more
than ever, passed Schmidt with
averted face in the street, and
hoped the Bernard-Renshaws
would cross him off their
visitors' list.
Schmidt had his own
methods of guerrilla warfare.
Mrs. Jones’s bedroom was
over the front steps of the
Bank of ; and now
Schmidt encouraged the men
who sat there at night to tell
dirty stories.
On the fourth night Mrs.
Jones retaliated by sluicing a
bucket of water over the steps
from inside the banking
chamber, and Schmidt and his
friends had to take themselves
off with wet tails.
By this time the whole town
was laughing. Councillor
Mullens and his wife, the three
parsons and their wives, the
priest, the two doctors and their
wives and other notables tried
to heal the breach. They
pointed out to Schmidt and
Mrs. Jones that the feud was
lowering the prestige of the
upper crust of Mundabilla. It
was to no avail.
Mrs. Jones said she was going
to report Mr. Schmidt to his
head-office. Mr. Schmidt
refused to discuss the matter.
Secretly most of the medi-
ators were on his side, although
the parsons were a little
troubled when they admitted it
to themselves. Mr. Schmidt
did drink and was fond of
women, whereas Mrs. Jones
was a pillar of the church, and
so forth. The trouble was that
Mrs. Jones wasn’t popular.
She did report Schmidt to
head-office and he had to
write five letters and send
several brace of wild-duck and
snipe to the inspectors before
the matter was squared-off.
There were no fresh develop-
ments for a few weeks. Then
one day young Bluey Reed, one
"It IS like me!"
of the town’s problem-children
from one of the town’s problem-
families, was heard to call
many times after Mrs. Jones
as she promenaded down Main
Street, displaying her new
flower-hat and parasol:
“Mrs. Jones,
A bag of bones.
A bellyful of fat —
And what do you think of
that!”
The verse was admittedly of
schoolboy standard, and the
whole episode may have been
merely coincidental. Bluey, a
12 - year - old member of
Mundabilla’s submerged tenth,
didn’t like Mrs. Jones. On the
other hand, the locals who
gathered at five-o’clock that
afternoon in the Royal re-
marked that Bluey had been
observed making a pig of him-
self on ice-cream and ginger-
beer. And, for the record,
thereafter he always spoke of
Mr. Schmidt with unreserved
boyish enthusiasm as a real
good bloke, even if he was
one of the toffs.
a hot afternoon about a
week later when Mrs.
Jones was brooding in her
lounge-room, the blinds drawn
to ward-off the sun, the tele-
phone rang. Mrs. Jones got up
languidly from the sofa and
went to answer it.
“Hullo,” she said, un-
enthusiastically.
“This is Olive Bernard-
Renshaw,” said the voice. “Is
that Mrs. Jones?.”
Mrs. Jones had a happy glint
in her eye when she hung-up.
The next morning, a Saturday,
she and her husband dressed
carefully in full evening-dress.
Mrs. Jones took four hours
over her toilet. At two-o’clock
they set out in the sulky on the
50-mile drive to Minoru. It
was hot, and before they had
gone 10 miles Mr. Jones’s white
shirt was limp and had lost
most of its starch, and Mrs.
Jones’s complexion was rosier
than she cared to contemplate.
Four hours later they
reached Minoru Station. Two
apathetic sheepdogs moved out
to greet them with a few per-
functory barks. An old ram
in the home-paddock put his
head up, looked at them with
rheumy eyes, and went back to
nibbling his supper. The long,
rambling homestead with its
wide verandas looked deserted.
Mrs. Jones and her husband
climbed stiffly out of the sulky
and shook the dust off them-
selves.
Old Matthew Bernard-
Renshaw came out then, draw-
ing on a coat as he walked.
He was followed a few minutes
later by his wife, who exclaimed
when she saw the Joneses:
“How hot to be travelling!
You must come in and have
a cup of tea!”
Mrs. Jones and her husband
had dinner that night at
Minoru, but it was hardly the
social triumph Mrs. Jones had
envisioned, because, after an
hour of tea-drinking, Mrs.
Bernard-Renshaw had said:
“We’d love you to have
dinner with us, but, of course,
you're going somewhere.”
"JYText stroke in Mr. Schmidt’s
guerrilla warfare against
Mrs. Jones was also not proven.
Mrs. Jones was president of
the Country Women’s Associa-
tion. (The diehards, inciden-
tally, didn’t like a “bird of
passage” holding this office
and said she had never been
a countrywoman.) In her
official capacity Mrs. Jones
received an elaborately iced
cake and a letter from what
claimed to be a new Sydney
cake firm. The company was
seeking the opinion of leading
Australian women.
Mrs. Jones showed the letter
with its impressive printed
heading and address to every-
one she knew and invited them
to a solemn cake-tasting.
All the town’s silvertails and
a few on the fringe were
invited —Mrs. Jones was demo-
cratic in the matter of sharing
her triumph. The more-affluent
drove to the Bank of Sydney
on that memorable Tuesday
afternoon. The less-prosperous
walked, panting under ridicu-
lously inefficient parasols and
fanning themselves strenuously.
Not since the Governor’s lady
had been entertained by the
Country Women’s Association
had there been such a roll-up.
Even Mrs. Bernard-Renshaw
came.
The editor of the Munda-
billa “Express and Examiner’’
was the only male present, and
he was there professionally.
This was not an occasion which
could be trusted to his one
reporter, an aged gentleman
who had once worked on
“Hansard” and had retired on
a pension he found too small
for his thirst. No ; Mr. Lewis,
the editor, decided, this was a
gala day that needed an
inspired pen—a verbatim

THE OTHER FELLOW'SMIND
The Future of Food
I’ve lately read in the daily
press several peeps into the
future —round about a.d. 2000
—compiled from the opinions
of “experts” in various
branches of science.
Whether a specialist can take
a balanced view of human
progress, without over-
emphasising his own speciality,
is doubtful. A case in point
is the prophecy, on which most
of them seem to agree, that
our grandchildren will eat food
very different from ours. It
will, it seems, be mainly
artificial. Some will be pro-
duced by algae, bacteria, yeasts,
moulds, fungi and other micro-
organisms, growing under
controlled conditions. Some
will be made by treating plant
wastes, such as grass, leaves
or sawdust, and some will be
synthesised from its elements.
Quite apart from the diffi-
culty of changing our eating
habits so drastically in the
short space of 40 years, recent
discoveries have shown that
nutrition is an extremely com-
plex subject, and suggest that
there is a vast amount we still
don’t know. We cannot syn-
thesise food that will keep us
in good health until we know
what elements it requires and
in what proportions, and in
what forms they are digestible.
The micro-organisms men-
tioned are really crops grown
for food, just like wheat or
potatoes, except for one very
important point they will
apparently be grown not in
the earth but in vats of
chemical solutions. Obviously
they can only get out of these
solutions what goes into them,
and we are a long way from
knowing what should go in.
Louis Bromfield, who was
not only a writer and speaker
of note but one of America's
best farmers, devoted much of
his later years to hammering
“Equator and tradition or not —I'll sue them!”
home the point that fertile,
well-managed soil produced
healthy crops, robust and
thrifty animals and healthy,
intelligent people. Barren,
eroded or overcropped soils
produced sickly crops, weak
unthrifty animals and un-
healthy, dull-witted people. The
evidence in support of this
proposition is very strong, but
just what is fertile soil?
It has been known for quite
a long time that all living
matter is made mainly of a
few elements carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
phosphorus, sulphur, calcium,
iron and a few more. Most of
these come from the soil, and
if any soil is deficient in one or
more, they can be added in
the form of chemical fertilisers.
But before they are of any use
to animals, the plants on which
the animals feed must manu-
facture them into many sub-
stances, some highly complex.
Some, such as vitamins, are
very delicate. They are only
formed in adequate amounts
when the plants are grown
under good conditions of soil,
sunlight, etc. They can be
destroyed by preserving (dry-
ing, salting, canning, freezing,
etc.), by careless cooking, by
refining, as in the case of flour
and sugar, and even, by long
storage in the natural state.
That being so, the quality of
any food that has gone through
extensive processing is likely
to be inferior to that of foods
nearer to their natural state.
In addition to these major
elements, we now know that a
number of others —the trace-
elements —are very important.
Plants and animals can live
without one or more of them,
but they will never thrive.
Deficiencies of these are
corrected by adding to the
soil as little as two pounds
to the acre of copper, or two
ounces of molybdenum. Too
much can be very harmful. Two
ounces mixed through an acre
of topsoil 6in. deep, is about
one part in 70 million. It is
far too little to be detected
by chemical analysis, and it
seems absurd that such small
amounts could have any effect
at all. But it has been proved
abundantly that their absence
causes disease in the vegetation
grown on deficient land and the
animals pastured on it —such
diseases as “coast sickness” in
stock and “straight steely”
wool in sheep. Little research
has been done on the effect
of these deficiencies on
humans, but it is likely to be
serious.
Louis Bromfield predicted
that it would some day be
shown that all the known
elements are necessary, in vary-
ing amounts, in truly fertile
soil. It seems quite probable.
If one part of molybdenum in
70 million makes all the
difference between barren and
fertile soil, who can say that
one part in 70 billion of, say,
hafnium or polonium, is not
equally vital? Yet, until we
can answer these questions,
who can say with any assurance
that food grown in chemicals,
highly processed and chemi-
cally altered food, or synthetic
food, is capable of producing
sound minds in sound bodies?
By all means experiment and
investigate, but research in
such matters is very slow and
difficult, and in the meantime
we will be playing safe if we
bend our energies to producing
more and better food while at
the same time building up the
fertility of our soil by good
husbandry as well as by adding
those elements that are shown
to be in short supply in our
particular soil. This is the
likeliest »way to produce
potentially first-class people.—
Magnoon (Q.).
Passenger Transport
“Tiddles” (B. 7/l/’59) sets
the W.A. transport brass an
impossible task in asking them
to charge fares that will pay
costs, and yet keep costs down
to a figure that users can afford
to pay. That brass must be
wondering, distractedly, why
on earth the W.A. Govern-
ment bought into a dying
industry by acquiring all the
privately owned bus-services in
Perth’s metropolitan area.
The trend against public
transport has been obvious for
years in the U.S., where a
responsible authority warned
that by 1965 there would be


no sleeper-coaches on trains,
and by 1970 there possibly
wouldn’t be any passengert-
trains at all.
That doesn’t mean that other
forms of public transport will
replace the railways; it’s all
part of a general movement
towards private transport,
accentuated by town-planning
designed to provide workers’
homes nearer to their jobs.
On the other hand, there'll
always have to be some form
of public transport; and there’s
only one way to provide it—
by taxing the community in
general. In other words, by
making those who don’t use
the. services pay for having
them available if they want
them.
That's what’s happening in
W.A. now, with motorists
carrying an unfair proportion
of the burden. With the com-
plete socialisation of public
transport in this State that
burden will become heavier. —-
Pieter Nuyts (W.A.).
Railways
Some railways do pay to-
day in spite of intense road
competition. The American
Chesapeake-Ohio Railroad
made $51.7 million in 1958
the fourth-best result per share
in 122 years of operation.
Could it be that private
enterprise was the chief factor?
—George Beesley (N.S.W.).
Invasion from the North
The oft-repeated warning of
the invasion of Australia by
the Asiatic hordes from the
north is raised again in
George Patterson’s article (B.
14/1/ ’59). I don’t agree.
Certainly we have a 12,000-
mile coastline, but where is the
threat from the south? If
there ever is an invasion from
the north —and with over 50
years' first-hand knowledge of
the “near-north” I don't think
it is likely—the invasion-points
by sea and air would ,be in
the northern half of the con-
tinent. so that we can cut down
the vulnerable coastline to at
least half —say, 6000 miles.
The greater portion of the
hinterland of this northern
half of Australia is practically
unsettled and produces little
or nothing in the way of food.
These invading hordes would
have to * bring their supplies
with them and maintain very
long . lines-of-communication.
Why didn't the laps make
landings on the Australian
mainland? They certainly
could have done so had they
wished, but they realised that
their lines-of-communication
were already stretched too far,
and this was borne out by sub-
sequent events.
In my opinion it is not in-
vading hordes or nuclear
weapons that will be the de-
ciding factor in any future
problematical invasion of Aus-
tralia from the north or any
other direction. It will be oil.
Unless we can find oil in Aus-
tralia or nearby New Guinea,
and thus be self-supporting in
that respect, we could be
brought to our knees in a
month by whoever was strong
enough, and wise enough, to
capture and hold the sources
of our present oil-supply.
Our planes would be
grounded, all motor - traffic
halted, shipping tied up, elec-
tricity supply curtailed, and
our diesel-locomotives out of
action. What would be the
use of a million trained
guerrillas, as Mr. Patterson
suggests, if we can’t transport
them to where they are
needed? If these trained men
lived round the coast that
might be invaded it would per-
haps be different, but, for the
most part, they would be
herded in large cities in the
far-south when they were
needed in the near-north.
Let us spend millions look-
ing for oil. If we can't find it,
then at least let us build-up
an emergency supply of im-
ported oil that would see us
over the first months of an
invasion. The petrol frittered
away in Australia each year on
useless and unnecessary motor
trips could, if saved and stored,
mean the difference between
victory and defeat in the event
of an invasion.—Tock Emma
(N.S.W.).
In “Danger of False
Security” (B. 14/l/’59), George
Patterson compares the 12,000-
mile coastline of Australia with
that of U.S.A. —merely 5-
million miles. Is not there
greater exuberance in the latter
figure than Americans usually
show?—B.R.F. (N.S.W.).
Education
Two news-items in my Mel-
bourne daily point a grim
warning. A retiring Sydney
professor complains of falling
educational standards and uni-
versity students who cannot
even spell. An 11-year-old
schoolgirl on holidays from
California tells of fashion
trends in Grade VI, observing
that Australian girls in Grade
VI lag far behind their
American cousins in the matter
of wardrobes.
The professor laments the
passing of mental disciplines
and the lowered appreciation
of the scholarship and culture
of the past. The Grade VI
girl expounds on under-
garments and figure-control.
With Australian educators
much influenced by American
education, whatever can
protect us from the grim pros-
pects ahead?
It should be the business of
our schools and 'our children
actively to pursue much
more substantial values than
they have been meddling with
in recent years. For instance,
astronomy has been a regular
school subject in U.S.S.R. for
more than 12 years.
Isn’t it time we raised our
school sights a little? Who can
protect us from university
students who cannot even spell
if our primary-school pupils
develop a competitive interest
in 75yd.-hem petticoats? Or
does it not matter that it may
soon be possible here to make
a living, as it is now in
America, by “ghosting” for
students who are incapable of
writing-up their own theses for
university degrees? Orion
(Vic.).
TV
“P.0.M.C.” (B. 14/1//59) is
off the beam. Paying big
money to writers in an effort to
get material specially written
for a medium is no cure, as
Hollywood discovered long
ago. Time and again they paid
big salaries to popular authors,
gave them every facility they
asked for, kept them on *the


payroll for long periods and
obtained very few usable
scripts. Even Edgar Wallace
was a flop at this form of
writing to order.
In the end, film-producers
generally have to fall back on
buying film-rights of novels
and setting hacks to work on
the task of adapting them for
the screen.
Quite a lot of writing to
order has been done for radio,
and its most striking result
has been to produce astonish-
ingly few things of any real
merit. One authority went so
far as to declare that “Sorry,
Wrong Number” was the only
play written specially for radio
which could be called a first-
class work.
Most of the world’s most
successful stage-shows have
been based upon novels, short-
stories or stage-plays. “My
Fair Lady” is the latest
example; others include
“Oklahoma!”, “South Pacific”
and “Guys and Dolls.”
As for TV executives not
subsidising periodicals which
print original fiction—Alfred
Hitchcock, one of the leading
lights, has been doing it for
a long time, and from the
stories submitted for his
“Mystery Magazine” he gets
ideas which can be adapted for
TV.
Expecting the born prose-
writer to turn out good work
while all the time worrying
about the technicalities of the
finished script needed for TV
is unreasonable. But once a
good, original story has been
written for print and has been
published, then there are
always people who can adapt
it.—H. A. Lindsay (S.A.).
Municipal Councils
Naturally the quality of
membership varies in muni-
cipal councils, but the best
of them give service to their
communities as good, if not
better, than would be pro-
vided by managers (B.
19/11/’5B).
In my municipality the
aldermen are mainly success-
ful and respected professional
men or businessmen. The coun-
cil is well managed ; it adjusts
revenue to genuine needs, and
does not charge the ratepayers
more than is necessary to run
the municipality on up-to-date
lines.
This year, as a result of the
Valuer-General raising local
valuations, the council cut the
rate 2d. in the £. My rate only
rose 30s. compared with the
previous year. Increased costs
would probably have necessi-
tated a similar rise had there
been no increase in valua-
tion.
Council managers, if nomi-
nated by the Minister of Local
Government, might well be
political appointees obnoxious
to the majority of ratepayers
in many municipalities. Also,
to attract good men high
salaries would have to be
offered. This would inevitably
mean widespread amalgama-
tion of municipalities, with a
corresponding weakening of
real local-government.— Terry
the Tory (N.S.W.).
High Cost of the A.B.C.
In the past 18 months the
A.B.C. has advertised on
several occasions for an
efficiency - officer. This
appointee is required to advise
the general-manager on staff-
needs and on the general appli-
cation of economy measures.
The fact that the position has
been re-advertised over a wide
coverage indicates that a suit-
able man is not available,
which is ridiculous, or, much
more likely, a man considered
suitable to the A.B.C. wouldn’t
have a bar of the organisation.
The organisation-chart of
the commission shows that
there are officers in highly paid
positions, including that of the
general-manager, whose sole
responsibility is to see that the
A.B.C. functions efficiently and
economically. Why an out-
sider is required to do the job
for them is anybody’s business
in the political arena, but is
every taxpayer’s concern out-
side the ivory tower.
Now the Treasury reports
the A.B.C. as spending at a
yearly rate of £11,238,000
against a Budget estimate of
£8,475,000. The expenditure of
£5,619,000 for the six months
to December 31, 1958, already
exceeds the amount spent for
the full year 1957-58
(£5,099,991).
The build-up of staff in the
A.B.C. during the past 12
months has been stupendous.
Parliament must ask the Public
Accounts Committee to make a
thorough investigation of the
commission’s affairs prior to
the dreadful phenomenon of
seeing ourselves go down the
drain on our own TV-sets. ~

international upheaval could
bring all Australian movement

Solution to Crossword No. 522.


magnificently iced single-tier
cake, had to be described with
the same poetic fervour that
possessed, say, Wordsworth,
when he chronicled the view
from Westminster Bridge.
“Ladies, I don’t know why
I should have been singled-out
for this great honor,” Mrs.
Jones simpered. “In fact, 1
feel it is not I but Munda-
billa that has been singled-out.”
Mr. Lewis’s pen was record-
ing faithfully. A small girl who
tried to poke a sticky finger
into the icing was firmly
smacked across the back by an
outraged mother ; the wife of
one of the small storekeepers in
the town, who believed herself
to be finally getting somewhere
socially.
“... .So I have asked you all
here to share in an honor which
is rightly yours and not mine,”
Mrs. Jones was saying.
There was much more of it,
followed by polite disagree-
ment from the perspiring ladies
at such depreciation, and inter-
spersed with coughs and mur-
murs of approval. Mr. Lewis
had preserved it all, except the
coughs, not in the pages of
the Mundabilla “Express and
Examiner” but in his note-
book. Mr. Lewis, a careful
man who had once been sued
for libel, always kept his note-
books.
“Now, ladies,” said Mrs.
Jones, “without further ado I
shall cut this magnificent cake.”
Mrs. Jones, gripping the
knife and her false teeth firmly,
plunged the knife into the cake.
Trembling a little, she cut a
wedge and lifted it out on the
blade of the knife.
“There, ladies,” she said.
“The cake”
She broke off, stiffening, then
peered down. The others
peered, all horror-stricken. It
couldn’t be, it couldn’t be . . .
But it was. The deceptively
iced cake was made of mud and
sawdust.
A ll Schmidt said later, when
his friends reported the
outrage, with sly winks, was:
“What the blazes are you
chaps going on like that for?
Very interesting—the cake, I
mean.”
The Great War came soon
after this, and Mrs. Jones came
into her own during four years
of hysteria in which even Beet-
hoven’s music was banned.
She found nine patriotic
Mundabilla residents to corro-
borate her assertion that she
had seen mysterious code-
signals flashing at night from
the top windows of the Bank
of Sydney.
Schmidt’s great-grandfather
had settled in Australia in 1830,
but it was no-go, and soon
after this his inspectors moved
him into the anonymity of the
head-office in Sydney.
"Now, tell me, honestly—how many times have you
heard this one before ?”
Arabian countries on ship-
ment of oil abroad.
Because we cannot consider
such a poor prospect, we must
build better main roads. But
other methods of improving
transport and making it
independent of outside happen-
ings must be considered and
should be given even higher
priority than improved roads,
in spite of the automobile, oil
and rubber interests.
Australia possesses three
power-sources, two of which
have tremendous reserves, and
the third of which will never
be exhausted as long as life
can exist in the world. Coal
is the most obvious and most
immediately available of these.
In Queensland alone, reserves
of coal, even if the fuel was
exploited to its fullest extent,
are enough for several hundred
years.
The British and the Germans
both developed methods of
refining petrol from coal during
the war. Such an industry,
based on such coalfields as the
Callide in Central Queensland,
could provide fuel for the
whole State, with plenty over
for the rest of Australia, to
say nothing of valuable by-
products from the processes.
If the steam-locomotive is
out of favor, this is due partly
to the fact that not enough
money and energy has been
spent on research to improve it.
Diesel’s original engine was
planned to be run on pulverised
coal. Some engineers say that
disposal of ash would be a
difficulty, but surely this
problem could be overcome?
If coal can’t be used in the
locomotives themselves, why
not build huge power-stations
on the coalfields and electrify
the railways? Electric power
is cheap to produce, cheap to
transport. The electrification
of the railways, building of
power-stations and running of
power-lines would be an
expensive capital item, but no
more expensive than the build-
ing of first-rate main trunk-
highways which will be out-
dated within a decade.
The second source of power
is uranium. If we were to
process the uranium here
instead of treating it like a
primary product and exporting
most of it, we could build clean
power-stations near good
water-sources, and again use the
power on electrified railways,
and, perhaps, design and build
electric-powered private cars
which could be recharged at
wayside sub-stations.
The inexhaustible source of
power is that of the sun.
American scientists have
already perfected a system of
batteries which can draw
sufficient power from the sun
to run a wireless-set indefi-
nitely ; surely a similar method
could be developed to power
passenger- and goods-carrying
vehicles?
Other countries, including
England where the sun is
notoriously rare in its appear-
ances, have proved that by use
of suitable mirrors the sun’s
rays can be concentrated to
provide sufficient heat to melt
rock. Why more attention has
not been paid in Australia to
the harnessing of this method
for the generation of electricity
is beyond me.
When all is said and done,
transport essentials consist of
keeping things moving. Aus-
tralia’s three power-sources, if
they are properly exploited,
can do this in the future to a
much greater degree than is
possible at present, and with-
out reliance on outside supplies
of materials. —R. H. (Q.).
Political Apathy
Most politically minded Aus-
tralians would readily agree
with “Xavier’s” remarks (B.
14/1/’59), but I suggest that
the only instruments “by which
policies could be nationally
determined without continuous
interference by State interests
or State executives” would be
acts of abolition of the several
State Parliaments, a proceeding
now almost 60 years overdue.
It is only in countries such
as Australia and America,
where the many Parliaments
aren't much better or more
useful than local-governing
councils, that politics is
regarded as “a pretty dirty
business” and policies are
boldly controlled by pressure-
groups.
Until the Federal House of
Representatives and Senate are
fully redesigned and patterned
on the world’s finest Parliament
—the British House of
Commons and House of Lords
—so long will State jealousies
retard our national progress,
with self-interested groups and
persons handling the reins of
State Government. Politically
thoughtful Australians should
study the history of the House
of Commons since around
the time of Henry VIII it and
it alone has progressively
moulded the English into the
greatest and probably the most
impartial race on earth.
Federation knits a nation,
but a Federal Parliament solely
and entirely representing the
nation does even more it
fosters the national political
spirit. South Africa, for all
its color-problems, has long
established a Parliamentary
system much nearer the ideal
of the Mother Country than
Australia’s and, incidentally,
puts Australia's hotch-potch of
Parliaments to shame.
Unfortunately, when the
existing system (of State
Parliaments) places power and
profit in the hands of the few,
abolition of such system meets
almost insurmountable opposi-
tion. Surely it’s worth altering
the Australian Constitution to
get rid of ours? P.O.M.C.

In some regions of
the Transvaal sheep
are reared exclusively
for mutto n, the
country being unsuit-
able for woolgrowing
because of humid
weather conditions
and excessive growth
of thorny bushes.
Scientists are now try-
ing to breed a local
type of sheep with a
sparse hairy coat in-
stead of fleece! Even
in the case of such a
breed the marking
and tailing of the
lambs by “Elastrator”
Rubber Rings would
be advisable because
lambs marked and
tailed in this way
suffer little, if any,

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
'DON[?] WCRRY IN SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS'
SHEEP AND WOOL IN PAKISTAN
[From R. E. G. CUNNINGHAM]
TThe earliest of the classic
writers indicate that sheep
and wool were known to the
inhabitants of the Indo-
Pakistan sub-continent as
sources of food and clothing,
even in prehistoric ages.
The code of Manu (God of
man in Hindu mythology) is
said to have assigned wool as
the material for the sacrificial
thread of Vaisya (a Hindu
sub-caste). Flymns to Pashau
(the God of shepherds) are
found in Rig-veda (the oldest
religious scriptures of the
Hindus) in whch even the
spinning of wool is mentioned.
Islamic history also reflects
on the Moslem belief that they
were shepherds for some time
at least. The great prophet
Mohammed himself had taken
up this occupation and is said
to have had a great liking for
woollen blankets. The know-
ledge of wool and sheep is thus
old among the Moslems, too,
and during their 12 centuries of
rule over India, they con-
tributed to the improvement of
this industry.
The early woollen garments
were produced in India by
plaiting, which process was
also used in making mats.
“What’re YOUR vital statistics , Herb?”
Hi s t o r i c excavations at
Mohenjo Daro (ruins of a town
of prehistoric civilisation
excavated in Sind in 1950) show
that wool was known to those
people as early as 3500 b.c.
Due attention was also paid to
improvement of Indian wool
during the British period,
especially to the shawl-wool of
the Punjab, Kashmir and Tibet.
Fryerl, in his writings, men-
tions Carminia wool, a raw
wool of olden times in India
which used to be exported by
the English companies.
With the division of the sub-
continent into two independent
countries —India and Pakistan
—in 1947, the wool-industry
became more important for
Pakistan than India, because
both the first- and second-class
wool-producing zones of un-
divided India happened to fall
in the territories of Pakistan.
Eighty per cent, of the popu-
lation of Pakistan is engaged in
agriculture and sheep are one
of the main occupations of
many tribes in West Pakistan.
The nomads in the North-
West Frontier province and
Baluchistan, in particular are,
more-or-less, entirely dependent
on this production and occu-
pation. In addition, wool is
one of the major exportable
commodities of Pakistan and
follows in importance after
jute, cotton and tea in pro-
viding the national income. A
study of 1950-51 figures shows
that Pakistan exported wool
worth 68.4 million rupees,
which constituted about 3.5 per
cent, of the total revenue from
the export of raw materials.
Sheep-herding for wool-
production is one of the main
occupations of a great number
of people in parts of the
country. After the division of
India, practically all the
Moslem population of the sub-
continent migrated to Pakistan
and consumption of mutton
rose very rapidly, as ail
Moslems are non-vegetarians,
whereas Hindus are mostly
vegetarians. Sheep-raising for
mutton-production to meet the
increasing demands became
more-important than ever. As
a result, the price-index for
mutton increased considerably
and resulted in higher returns
from mutton than from wool.
People began slaughtering even
the good wool-producing
animals, and the sheep popu-
lation started to decline. To-
day numbers have reached an
alarming low.
A survey of the carpet-wool
producing countries of the
world shows that Pakistan is
one of the few countries where
many of the finest types of
carpet-wools are produced.
Because of trade restrictions
since the Communist occupa-
tion of China, it is now one of
the most important and signi-
ficant sources of carpet-wools,
exporting approximately 27-
million pounds annually.
Pakistan wools are in great
demand in the world market
today, and some of the types
even fetch the highest prices
paid for carpet-wools in the
Liverpool and Boston markets.
Amongst the principal breeds
of sheep in Pakistan which the
author particularly studied
were the following: Harnai,
Rakhshani, Bimbric, Kakri,
Baluch and Bahawalpur.
Harnai: These are the most
numerous of the above breeds,
producing a good staple of
wool, comparatively fine, and
suitable for carpet-making and
the. manufacture of blankets,
overcoats, rough tweeds, etc. I
have seen some of this breed
carrying a fleece 61b. in weight.
This breed is hardy and
thrifty, and highly prolific and
fertile. Also, it has a good
frame and is suitable for
mutton purposes. In 1952 this
breed produced 10,000 maunds
of wool (a maund is 801 b.).
Rakhshani: These, the next
most numerous on the range,
produced 2000 maunds of wool
in 1952. The staple of the
wool is longer and liner than
any other breed in Baluchistan.
They can be considered good
mutton, but are probably not as
robust as the Harnai nor as
prolific.
Kakri: Mostly found in the
Ahob district, these compare
favorably with the Harnai
breed except that the wool has
a higher grease-content and is
inclined to be yellowish.
Baluch : This breed is prac-
tically confined to the Chagai
district. They are much
smaller than the Harnai,
carrying a dirty type of
wool, with a mixture of
white and black to the extent
of 60 per cent, of each flock.
This sheep is in no way com-
parable with other breeds in
Baluchistan.
Bimbric : This breed is much
smaller in frame than the
Harnai and the wool lacks the
quality of other breeds except
for carpet-making ; but for this
purpose, because of its coarse-
ness, it is considered the best
available.
Bahawalpur: Bred on the
plains of Bahawalpur, this is a
big-framed sheep, thin-tailed,
with the appearance of a
Corriedale. In fact, the breed
is supposed to be descended
from some Merino sheep im-
ported into India in the 1920’5.
The quality of the wool, which

SYDNEY
averages in the 50’s, would
indicate this.
The above breeds are about
equally divided between fat-
and thin-tailed sheep. All the
wool carries an approximate
3 per cent, grease-content with
a staple up to 6in. in length.
Owing to its low grease- and
moisture-content, it is dry and
harsh to handle. Shearing
takes place twice a year, one
clip being yellow in color and
the other white because of
seasonal 'influences, which
necessitates this bi-yearly shear-
ing. The average cut is about
31b. — covering both shearings
—the yield, of course, being
high because of the low grease-
content and the absence of
much dust or vegetable matter.
In Karachi, the Govern-
ment set up a “wool-test
house,” where, by legislation,
samples of all wool for export
must be tested. If unsatisfac-
tory, the export-licence is with-
held and the wool must be re-
washed. Consequently, buyers
in any part of the world can
buy wool with a Government-
guaranteed standard of quality
and yield.
Wool is sold by the producer
to travelling woolbuyers, who
invariably pay the farmer much
below the market-value, thus
robbing him and making it
more difficult for him to earn
a livelihood from wool. There
are no wool-auctions in
Pakistan, but in Karachi a
number of woolbrokers sell
wool direct to buyers from
other countries having
bought wool themselves from
the travelling woolbuyers. So
the producer gets a very raw
deal.
There is no attempt by the
producer at classing wool as we
do in Australia, so the ulti-
mate buyer makes a really
good profit from classing the
wool and selling in each grade.
The carpet-wool trade has a
most important potential for
Pakistan, and any attempt by
well-meaning people to intro-
duce exotic breeds of sheep
would deal a crippling blow
to the sheep-farmer and
seriously affect the economy of
the country. There is a world-
wide demand for carpet-wool,
and Pakistan should be as
jealous of its product as Aus-
tralia is of its finer wools.
Early-bearing
Fruit-trees
“Big Billy”: Apple- and
pear-trees growing in deep,
fertile soils or in high-rainfall
areas, and which are given
normal pruning and treatment,
may not come into bearing
until later than four or five
years. Experiments in the
western States of the U.S.A.
have shown two methods of
inducing earlier bearing of
healthy trees.
One is to keep young trees
short of water during the first
half of the summer. The
other is to make a single cut
with a sharp knife right
round the trunk, deep enough
to penetrate the bark and
cambium layer, but avoiding
damage to the wood or the
sap-bearing part of the tree.
This cut, if made at late petal-
fall, will temporarily delay
transfer to the roots of carbo-
hydrates which build-up the
upper part of the tree and will
produce a heavy blossoming
the following spring.
This method isn’t practic-
able on a large scale, but is
worth a. trial on small areas,
and particularly on those trees
where bearing has been
delayed. But don’t use it on
stone-fruit trees because there
wounding of the trunk could
lead to damage by the bacteria
causing gummosis.
Winter Wheat
The real value of a wheat of
winter habit under Australian
conditions is that advantage
may be taken of late summer
or early autumn rains to sow
before April without the plants
stemming-up or coming into
head during winter and then
suffering from frost, as may
happen when the usual spring-
wheats are sown too early.
Another advantage lies in the
abundant tillering during
autumn, which permits, when
desired, early grazing of the
crop.
Winter Minflor, the only
winter-wheat grown in any
quantity at present, while
possessing the desirable “winter
habit,” has these disadvantages:
susceptibility to rust, weak
straw and inferior grain-
quality. However, its use for
early sowing for grazing and
grain has expanded to a
marked degree in the past few
years in the north-west of
N.S.W. where, this year, some
thousands of acres have been
sown.
Early Blackhull, intro-
duced from the U.S.A., has also
been grown commercially in
N.S.W. This variety matures
later than Winter Minflor and
consequently suffers less from
stem-frosting by late spring
frosts. The head is bearded
and the grain red, the latter
being a disadvantage in Aus-
tralia, where wheat production
is standardised on white-grain
types. Moreover, Early Black-
hull is too late maturing for
most of our wheat-belt and its
grain quality is rather low.
The first Australian-bred
winter-wheat, Winglen, was
released in 1957. A.sister-line
of Charter (Kenya C 6042 x
Gular) was crossed with Winter
Minflor by S. L. Macindoe,
and an F 4 line was selected
by him at Minnesota, U.S.A.
This strain was fiixed for
winterness and for stem-rust
resistance. It was then crossed
by W. V. Single with a sister-
line of Celebration (Double
Cross x Dundee x Dundee).
Final selection from this cross
was made by E. M- Matheson.
Winglen, which is late
maturing and has good-quality
grain—comparable to Gabo —
was bred as a , dual-purpose
variety for grazing and sub-
sequent recovery for grain for
the north-west of N.S.W.
Selected to combine the stem-
rust resistances of Charter and
Celebration, it has given good
field-resistance, but in 1957 was
classified as susceptible to
Strain 21-2. Since this is by
far the most prevalent strain
of stem-rust in northern
N.S.W., efforts are being made
to incorporate more resistance
into Winglen. However, during
the 1958 rust - epidemic,
Winglen showed quite a fair
tolerance to stem-rust.
Spraying Versus
Dusting
“Billjim”: Spraying is often
more versatile for general
farm use, but dusting does not
usually call for measuring or
mixing, so application is
quicker. And there’s no need
to carry heavy buckets of
liquid.
On the other hand, dusting
has the disadvantage of being
unable to control effectively
certain insect-pests and diseases.
Adhesion is not so good as
sprays, so applications have to
be made more often. Dusting
also can only be applied when
there is no wind.
In a spraying-programme
bear the following points in
mind: Respray after heavy
rain, especially if the spray
hasn’t had time to dry. Don’t
try to spray from only one
angle; several angles are
necessary for proper coverage.
Choose a calm, warm day for
spraying (nicotine - sulphate
sprays . are most effective in
hot weather). For garden
spraying don’t use equipment
already used for hormone-
weedkillers. Don’t spray
plants which are being visited
by bees with insecticides such
as D:D.T., which are toxic to
insects for a long time. When
using a combined spray con-
sult a chart to make sure that
adverse reactions are not likely
to occur.
Crosses for Fat-lambs
“Sundowner”: Research at
the Kybybolite (S.A.) station
shows that the Border
Leicester-Merino ewe will give
higher lambing - percentages
and has better rearing-ability,
as well as higher wool-returns
and heavier lambs at birth,
than either Romney Marsh
cross Merino or Corriedale.
Trials conducted over three
years have aimed at assessing
the medits of various combina-
tions of breeds of sheep for
lamb-raising in 20in.- to 30in.-
rainfall country. Pastures used
were mixtures of sub.-clover
and Wimmera-ryegrass with
volunteer annual grasses,
chiefly barley-grass and soft
brome. Stocking-rate adopted
was 24- breeding-ewes to an
acre, and flock-management
included drenching the ewes
with phenothiazine four weeks
before lambing.
A summer drench was also
given, where necessary, follow-
ing rains. Lambs were not
drenched. Foot-trimming and
crutching were done before
lambing and again in the


spring. Inoculations of C.S.L’.
trypsinized enterotoxsemia vac-
cine were given two weeks
before lambing. Lambs were
marked when the oldest was
three weeks.
Woodiness in
Passionfruit
“Myall” ; Growers of passion-
fruit in N.S.W. and Queensland
are sometimes puzzfed by fruit
becoming misshapen as it
matures, with the rind thick,
hard and woody and contain-
ing little or no pulp.
This condition is known as
“woodiness” or “bullet,” and
is caused by a virus which
often attacks plants during the
winter. The disease shows no
lesion, such as a spot or rot,
so it’s difficult to detect until
the fruit is nearly mature.
During winter, the leaves of
affected vines become crinkled
and puckered and often
irregular in shape, quite un-
like those of healthy plants.
If closely examined, a faint
mottling of small yellowish-
green spots may be seen over
part of the leaves. In early
stages of the disease the vine
will often appear quite healthy,
but later it becomes stunted
and shows a coarse, unnatural
development. During summer,
affected vines may produce
quite a good crop, but the
winter-fruit will be woody and
worthless.
The virus enters the sap of
the diseased vine and, being
infectious, is easily transmitted
to healthy vines from the
hands or pruning-knives or by
aphids which feed on the vines.
There’s no known cure for
“woodiness,” but several pre-
cautions can be taken to help
keep the plantation clean. All
seed should come from a
strong, healthy vine, and
before setting-out the young
plants examine them carefully
for any abnormalities which
might indicate the presence of
“woodiness.” Any affected
should be destroyed immedi-
ately, as they will cause
trouble if planted-out. Once the
disease has made its appearance
vines should be inspected
regularly, and if affected
should be thoroughly sprayed
with nicotine-sulphate and then
rooted-out and burnt. All
vines in the vicinity should
also be sprayed with the insecti-
cide. Great care should be
taken when pruning the vines
in a plantation where “woodi-
ness” has appeared. It’s easy
to overlook a diseased plant,
and if one of these should be
pruned the disease will be
spread to others unless the
knife is disinfected after each
pruning. Always carry a piece
of rag and a jar containing a
freshly prepared solution of
tannic-acid or potassium-per-
manganate (Condy’s crystals)
at 3 per cent, strength with
which to disinfect the hands
and pruning-instruments.
The wild, white passionfruit
has been found to be largely
infested by the virus and con-
stitutes a definite menace to
any plantation in the vicinity.
A careful search for these wild
plants should be made, and any
discovered should immediately
be destroyed.
Urochlod
“Heresone”: Urochloa is all
that “Myall” claims (B.
31/12/ ’5B), but there’s another
side to the picture. It needs
heat and moisture, and seldom
gives much feed before Christ-
mas. By mid-March it is
drying-off and declining in
food-value and palatability.
Even at this period a hot, dry
spell wilts it badly.
It is a bad weed in cultiva-
tion, very hard to kill in moist
soil and choking-out most
summer crops, particularly
lucerne, once it gets a hold.
Mowing encourages it, as the
main stems hug the ground and
the mower misses them. Heavy
grazing will keep it in check,
however, as stock usually
prefer it, at its best, to lucerne.
As a pasture, its chief fault,
apart from its short season, is
its habit of excessive seeding,
which means that next year’s
growth, if unchecked, will be
overcrowded, spindly and
unthrifty. Heavy grazing will
reduce the seed set, or a scari-
fier, put through the young
seedlings will thin them out.
Growing Trees for
Profit
“Pieter Nuyts”: The Wes-
tralian Forests Department is
to survey the timber on private
land throughout the State with
the idea of encouraging land-
owners to plant timber where
the land isn’t specially suited
to other, shorter-term crops.
It’s a good move, and some
farmers could find it attrac-
tive. Australia’s timber-
resources are dwindling
rapidly and, whatever steps
are taken now, there’ll be a
very severe shortage in a few
years’ time. That doesn’t
apply only to Australia, either
—the shortage will be world-
wide. It may be alleviated in
some areas, notably in Siberia
and some of the world’s more
barren places, where tree-
planting on a huge scale is
being used to halt the. advanc-
ing deserts. If those experi-
ments are successful they’ll
pay-off in more ways than one.
Much of the same idea could
be used on some Westralian
farms where unrestricted clear-
ing has brought the salt to the
surface and made big areas of
what used to be good wheat-
land completely barren. Trees
used to grow on those patches
and might be grown there
again; in which case they’d
prevent the spread of the salt
and provide an income from
their timber.
Then there are thousands of
farms in W.A. with hardly a
shade-tree to a thousand acres.
A few trees planted in the
corners and possibly the centres
of every paddock wouldn’t
occupy much valuable space.
They would provide badly
needed sheep-shelter and give
their owner a very saleable
commodity in a few years’
time. Tree-lined roadways
through the farm could pro-
vide good stands of timber at
little sacrifice of usable land
and would add immeasurably
to the general appearance.
They’d also provide wind-
breaks and would counter
erosion.
But the best results could
come from the large amount
of land which is now being
cropped at just a bare profit—
and in a few years’ time even
that bare margin may have
disappeared. Much of that
land would grow good timber,
and under expert guidance the
returns could exceed those
from ordinary farm-crops on
even good land.
In some areas the scheme
would need to be organised on
a community basis, so that
the number of small stands
throughout the district would
add up to enough to warrant
the establishment of a mill.
The tendency now is to cart
logs long distances to the saw,
and every day logs on their
way to the mills pass idle land
which could be producing
timber.
Then there are trees which
might be profitable even in
isolated stands. There are
trees suitable for match-
making the match-manufac-
turers would say which species
they prefer and might even
supply the seedlings—and
cork-trees, which give com-
paratively quick returns, since
stripping commences at about
12 years old and can be
repeated every seven years or
so for perhaps a couple of
centuries. This should be a
good tree for country road-
boards to plant along their
miles of roads. Then there
are trees which could provide
staves for casks and barrels,
others which are suitable for
axe-handles, bats and other
sporting equipment. Manufac-
turers would buy isolated
stands of such trees and trans-
port them long distances profit-
ably. In 30 years’ time they’ll
be chasing them.
There’s nothing chancy about
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(15/1/’59.)
Heavy general rains are indicated for Queensland
during February, with heaviest falls on the central coast and
possibly widespread flooding. Similar conditions are likely in
March, although rainfall may be patchy in the far south-
west districts.
General rains are likely in N.S.W. during February,
and heavy falls should occur on the North Coast, northern
tablelands and n.-w. slopes and plains areas and part of the
Hunter River Valley. The coastal districts should receive
moderate rains in March; although rainfall may be patchy
elsewhere. Moderate general rains are likely in April, with
heavy falls on the central and mid-North Coast districts and
part of the Hunter River Valley.
There should be general rains above average in Vic-
toria during February, and reasonably good follow-on rains
in March, with heaviest falls in the central division.
Moderate to heavy rains are indicated in the agricul-
tural areas and n.-w. interior of South Australia during
February, although rainfall may be poor elsewhere in the
pastoral areas. Rainfall may be patchy and below normal
during March.
In Western Australia reasonably good rains are indi-
cated in the North Kimberleys during February, although
rainfall may be poor elsewhere. Rainfall may also be poor
during March.

Phalaris Tuberosa
“North”: Phalaris tuberosa,
or Toowoomba canary-grass,
is gaining favor every year as
graziers and dairymen recog-
nise it as one of the finest
pasture-grasses in cultivation
today. A native of Medi-
terranean Europe, it was intro-
duced into Australia in 1883
by Dr. R. Harding, who sowed
it in the Toowoomba (Q.).
botanical gardens. Phalaris is
a winter grass, yielding succur
lent, palatable feed in quantity
when many other grasses are
dormant. It resists drought
when once established, and
comes away quickly after a fall
of rain.
The best time for sowing is
from February to April, so
that the plants will be estab-
lished before the start of
summer. Most soils suit it, but
the yield is heavier on richer
ground. Prepare the seed-bed
thoroughly, bringing it to a
fine tilth. Sown alone, 31b. an
acre are enough in drills, but
61b. to 81b. will be needed if
broadcast. Some white Dutch
or sub.-ciover mixed and sown
with the seed will improve the
pasture. It needs little cover-
ing, and a light rolling is
usually sufficient.
Being a quick grower, the
grass is ready for grazing in
normal seasons about 14 weeks
after sowing. It should be fed-
off quickly, and the paddock
spelled until fresh growth is
made, when it may be grazed
again. Phalaris makes excel-
lent hay, if cut just as the
seedheads begin to peep.
At times, owing to heavy
stocking, the plants will become
root-bound and the pasture
will need renovating. Use a
stiff-tined cultivator in early
spring, working both ways. The
grass responds to topdressing,
and lcwt. to 2cwt. of super, an
acre will prove beneficial.
Under normal conditions,
phalaris will carry one beast
to the acre. In one experiment
nine sheep were pastured for
12 months, on four acres of the
grass, mixed with some white
Dutch clover, and it was found
almost impossible for the
animals to keep it fed down.
It is also a good fattening
grass, and records show that
sheep pastured on it were over
30 per cent, heavier than those
grazing a mixture of cocksfoot,
rye-grass and red-clover.
Intending growers should
make certain that they buy
genuine Phalaris tuberosa
seed, and not P. minor, an
annual variety. Although very
good feed, this variety will
survive only for one year and
cannot give the satisfaction that
the perennial will.
Care with Stock
“Big Billy”: The essentials
of good stockmanship are keen
observation, patience and
anticipation plus frequent
mustering and movement, par-
ticularly of beef-cattle, to
ensure maximum quiet. Kind-
ness to dairy-cattle from calf-
hood will pay-off later in good
behavior in the shed. In draft-
ing and marking sheep, take
care that there’s no bruising.
Emphasis on care applies
generally in loading stock and
in droving, whether on the hoof
or in the truck. Quietness is an
important attribute in beef-
cattle as a fattener will show
when he is making his pur-
chases at store-sales. Quiet and
contented cattle settle down
quicker in their new surround-
ings and consequently fatten
quicker.
Tractable dairy-cattle are
evidence of earlier good treat-
ment. If an owner can
approach his beasts with
equanimity it means the
animals will behave well in the
shed, give a quicker let-down
and milk faster. Back-chains
and leg-ropes shouldn’t be
needed with a well-handled
herd.
Sheep are handled more than
other meat-producing animals,
so extra care is needed in their
treatment, particularly to avoid
bruising. Don’t lift lambs into
a truck by the wool ; this will
cause bruising. A dog used in
the lamb-race thought useful
sometimes, has disadvantages
for the same reason.
Failure to drive with care
can easily cancel all the
trouble taken in loading sheep
on to stock - transports.
Common causes of trucking-
injuries are overloading, carry-
ing weak animals with robust
beasts, failure to partition-off
unruly horned animals and
failure to restrain bulls effec-
tively. Another point: trucks
should always be kept clean
to provide firm footing for the
animals, apart from considera-
tions of hygiene.
Losses from overloading
with consequent bruising and
injury will be greater than extra
freight-charges, so carriers
should be restrained from
putting in an extra one or two
animals. Also see that handling-
equipment on the farm,
including loading-races and
approaches, are up-to-date.
Poa Aquatica
“Fencer”: To reclaim
swampy lands and marshes in
sub-tropical districts easily and
cheaply, try planting Poa
aquatica, (water - meadow
grass). This perennial often
reaches 6ft. and is thoroughly
permanent. It needs no culti-
vation, either before or after
planting, being propagated by
sods cut from roots and carry-
ing stems and leaves, which are
planted in wet soil, mud or
shallow water. Keep the leaves
above the surface. It may be
planted at any time of the year,
since the grass is very hardy,
and can stand even heavy
frosts. The sods should be
spaced from sft. to 15ft. apart,
because the grass spreads
rapidly and soon covers the
surface.
With its long, underground,
fibrous roots and dense,
upright vegetation, Poa
aquatica will choke-out most
other aquatic plants, like
rushes, sedges, sword-grass and
lilies. Unlike Paspalum disti-
chum, it will not invade culti-
vated land ; but grows only in
swampy, wet places, where
nothing else of value comes up.
The herbage is palatable,
rich in sugar, and with a
protein-content over 1 per cent,
higher than either Japanese
millet or Paspalum dilatatum.
When made into hay, it com-
pares favorably with dried
lucerne. The plant yields an
enormous crop of fodder, and
may be cut four or five times
a year. It will stand heavy
stocking, and has a high carry-
ing-capacity.
Poa aquatica is excellent for
preventing soil-erosion along
the banks of streams, and in
gullies and shallow creek-beds.
Here it should be planted
firmly into the ground to resist
the action of running water,
but once established, nothing
will dislodge it.
The grass is not recom-
mended for tropical climates,
where shallow water in marshes
almost reaches boiling-point in
summer, but in sub-tropical
districts it is invaluable.
Farm Hint
“C.A.A.”: Aerial baiting of
some of the more inaccessible
of the rabbit-infested areas in
Victoria is under way. So far
38,000 acres have been covered
at an average cost of 3s. 9d. an
acre. The campaign is part of
the Lands Department’s drive
to supplement the effects of
myxo. Baits used are 1080-
charged carrots. One of the
immediate beneficial effects of
the baiting is the regeneration
of trees in State forest-areas.

How to make parsnip wine ?
Wash the parsnips and peel them
thinly. Cut into thick slices; weigh
341 b. and put into a pan with lgal.
of water. Boil until they are quite
soft, then strain the liquor through
a sieve, pressing out as much
juice as possible, but ensuring that
no parsnip passes through the sieve.
Allow 31b. of sugar to every gal.
ol liquor. Boil for 45min., then
pour into a large vessel, leave
until lukewarm and add a little
yeast spread on a slice of toast.
(The yeast is only to help fermenta-
tion, and may be removed after a
few days.) Leave the liquor to
stand for 10 days, stirring well each
day. Pour it into a cask, and it will
be ready for bottling in eight or
nine months.

glue and a supply of water. Slake
the lime in a lOgal. receptacle,
cover it, strain through coarse cloth
and add the salt previously dis-
solved in warm water. Blend the
rice-flour smoothly in cold water
and boil it; soak the glue in water
and dissolve on a water bath (a tin
enclosed in a pot of water will do
this). Add rice, glue and whiting
with sgals. hot water to the lime
mixture, stirring well. Protect from
dirt for a few days before use.
Should be applied hot in small
quantities—keep it hot over a port-
able stove or use quickly from a
fireplace. S

Particulars of life and career of
writer Frank Harris ?
Born at Galway, Ireland,
February 14, 1856, he emigrated to
the U.S.A., where he had ajn
adventurous career. Later he went
to Europe and studied at several
universities, and in England edited
in turn the “Evening News',”
“Fortnightly Review,” “Saturday
Review” and “Vanity Fair.” Later
he conducted a magazine of his
own. His editorial qualifications
were regarded as of a very high
order, but he got into difficulties
in England, and subsequently in
the U.S.A. He settled at Nice with
his second wife, and died there on
August 26, 1931. His Contemporary
Portraits are the result of his meet-
ings with famous men of letters.
There was strong feeling in regard
to his book dealing with Oscar
Wilde, and the story of his own
life, under the title My Life and
Loves, could not find a publisher
in England or the U.S.A., and was
published in Germany. Copies
landed in New York were seized,
and in later editions portions were
omitted. Other publications in-
clude The Man Shakspeare, The
Women of Shakspeare and the
plays “Mr. and Mrs. Daventry,”
“Shakspeare and His Love” and
“Joan la Romee,” together with a
number of novels and short-stories.

Information on the fruit monster a
deliciosa ?
It is an aroid or arum-type climb-
ing monocotyledon, one of the two
great divisions of flowering plants
w'hich include lilies, palms, etc. A
native of the tropical forests of
Mexico, under tropical conditions
of warmth and plenty of water
monstera grows to a monstrous
size—utterly unlike the small
stunted pot-specimens seen in
house-decoration. It does best in
half-shade in good soil, and will
scramble over a garden wall or
shed by twisting its leafy stems
round any available support or part
of itself. Like all the aroids, its
inflorescence is a spathe enclosing
an upright spike with male or
pollen flowers at the top half, the
fruiting or female flowers at the
lower part. After pollination the
top part of the spike or spadix
withers off, leaving the lower part
to grow into the thick, fleshy fruit,
made up of numerous seeds, which
can be skinned and eaten. Some
people like the flavor, but the fruit
is too insignificant to be commer-
cially valuable, and is usually
regarded as a garden novelty. The
plant is easily propagated from
short jointed pieces of the stem
laid lightly in damp soil and kept
moist. Its large, handsome, slotted
leaves make it useful as a decora-
tive plant, but it must have gener-
ous conditions to produce fruit and
flowers plentifully. It thrives where
there is no frost.

* How does an altimeter work ?
In essence this instrument is
merely an aneroid barometer,
graduated to read in thousands of
feet. The relation between altitude
and atmospheric pressure is the
underying principle of the alti-
meter : it actually registers the pres-
sure in which it finds itself, being
connected to a “static head.” The
static pressure is again used to act
on a metal capsule, though this
time the capsule has been exhausted
of air and sealed, the pressure out-
side causing it to be deformed in
varying degrees. This movement is
converted b'y a simple mechanism
into the rotary movement of a
needle round a dial which has
been graduated (or calibrated) into
distances above sea-level.
In practice, such a simple alti-
meter would not be accurate, be-


cause the relation between pressure
and altitude is not quite in strict
proportion, but is subject to varia-
tions. These discrepancies are to
a large extent corrected by manu-
facturers, who take many readings
to find the average variations and
adjust the instrument accordingly.
Again, changes in temperature
affect the accuracy of the readings,
and this is also allowed for in the
design of the instrument. As
atmospheric pressure varies from
time to time at any given height,
the instrument must be set to zero
before the aircraft leaves the
ground, so that it will agree with
the pressure at that time. In some
cases the needle is set not at zero
but at the height of the aerodrome
above sea-level. To avoid confu-
sion on landing the pilot must know
the original setting. The adjust-
ment is made by a small button on
the dial of the instrument.

How to clean * a white enamel
bucket used only for rain-water ?
If the enamel is of poor quality,
or if it has been damaged by hot
water, thus becoming slightly
porous, no amount of surface rub-
bing will clean it, since the dirt is
subcutaneous. Discoloration may
have been caused by an infusion of
some kind of leaves in the gutters.
Try rubbing with vinegar on a cloth
dipped in salt, lemon and salt,
petrol and whiting, or plain sand.
Use a magnifier to identify the
nature of the marks, which might
give a clue to a cleaning method.
The water should be filtered into
the bucket through butter-muslin.
Brief Answers
J.E.S. (Dub'bo): Write to Con-
solidated Zinc, 82 Pitt Street, Syd-
ney.... G.S.: The instructions on
an “order” cheque apply to a par-
ticular branch of a particular bank
to pay a specified person, or, at his
order, anyone else. If the payee’s
bank (the collecting bank) gives
value for the cheque to the wrong
person, i.e., disregards the tenor
of the cheque, it may be liable to
suffer any loss incurred by the
drawer —thus the paying bank may
refuse to make payment. In the
case of an uncrossed cheque pre-
sented for payment in cash the col-
lecting bank can protect itself by
requesting an endorsement on the
cheque, this endorsement giving the
bank itself a legal right to the
cheque and a claim on the original
drawer and subsequent endorsee.
....E.J.: Coin is worth no more
than face-value... .V. 1.: (1) Try
asking him tactfully to desist. It
this fails, don't insult him:
organists aren’t exactly two-a-
penny these days. (2) Not a
chance. (3) Surely it would be
stretching things to see a solicitor?
... .8.W.: (1) It is due to a disease
of the skin of the scalp known as
seborrhoea, considered to be trans-
missible, and is thought to have
become more common by the
general use of barb'ers’-shops;
where the hair is cut at home it is
not so common. (2) Most times,
no. An old remedy, still considered
good, is the application of an oint-
ment made of 18 grains each of
sulphur and salicylic-acid in an
ounce of vaseline, rubbed in daily,
with frequent thorough shampoos.
A daily washing with soap-spirit
alone has been known to cure a
mild case. (3) Impossible to say;
but anyone who discovers a quick,
reliable cure will get rich quick.
(4) No information yet available in
Australia.... J.M.P.: No articles
on that subject have appeared....
5.0.: (1) The Bureau of Agricul-
tural Economics conducts surveys
of the wool and sheep industries
which give valuable information on
production-costs and income-trends
in the pastoral, wheat-sheep and
high-rainfall zones of Australia. It
also does research into the factors
affecting the market outlook for
wool, including the effect of com-
petition from man-made fibres. (2)
From Consolidated Revenue....
W.E.T.: (1) Carbide is defined by
Webster’s as “a binary compound
of carbon with a more positive
element; specif., calcium carbide”
—which it in turn defines as “a
crystalline solid, often resembling
grey limestone, which is made by
heating lime and carbon together
in the electric furnace, and is used
for the generation of acetylene and
for making calcium cyanamide.”
(2) No information... .Frangeo:
Arthur Mailey and Clarrie Grim-
mett played together in four Tests
- —the fifth Test in Sydney in 1924-25
(Grimmett’s first Test, in which he
took 5-45 and 6-37) and the last
three of the five 1926 Tests in
England... .P.K.M.: (1) Excellent

The premiere of “My Fair Lady” at
Her Majesty’s was one of the most
glamorous and exciting social occasions
this city has had in years. The show
itself is beautifully dressed with special
emphasis on elegance in the Ascot and
ballrooms scenes.
Lady Tait, wearing a magnificent
formal gown of turquoise-blue satin
embroidered on the strapless bodice and
with two wide panels falling into a
train from the back of the bodice, sat
in a box with Sir Frank and their
daughters, Isla, Anne and Sally. In
another box were John McCallum and
his wife Googie Withers, the latter’s
short strapless gown of jade-green satin
featuring the peacock-hemline and apron-
fronted skirt. Mrs. Sam Liff, wife of
the producer, chose a sheath-gown of
magnolia satin ; the strapless bodice was
gold-embroidered, and two wide floating-
panels fell to the hem from the back of
the bodice. Orchids pinned in the chignon
hairdo worn by Mrs. lan Miller matched
the flowers patterned in her white chiffon
frock.
Lady Robinson's choice was a short,
slim frock of steel - grey satin - brocade,
Mrs. Norman Spry chose white tinsel-
cotton for her Empire-line full-skirted
frock, the high waistline outlined with
a japonica satin sash. One of the loveliest
gowns was worn by Mrs. Ronald Nott;
of draped white chiffon, it had two wide
floating-panels of pale-pink and rose-
pink taffeta at the back.
Also in the audience were Mr. and
Mrs. Len Buxton ; Mrs. John Mitchell;
Mr. and Mrs. Alan Scott; Mrs. Eric
Wahlquist (her lovely frock was of rose-
pink-and-gold striped organza); Sir
Arthur and Lady Smithers and their
son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs.
Brooks-Jackson, of Broadford ; Mrs.
Bill Gluth (whose Grecian gown was of
smoke-grey chiffon); Mrs. Tony
Shepherd (wearing a full-length gown
of white chiffon coin-spotted in red);
Doris Fitton (of Sydney’s Independent
Theatre) and Joyce Bowden, also from
Sydney, Evie Hayes (in a powder-blue
faille full-skirted frock); and Mrs. Bill
Graves, of Surfers' Paradise.
Lovely Wilma Hooper (in private life
she is Mrs. M. Kemp) is delighting both

SYDNEY
Talk around town covered a wide area
this week, and ranged from the deep con-
cern felt for the babies in Melbourne's
heat to the indignation of Parliamen-
tarians “putting up their own salaries
again.” The Japanese fireworks-display
went-off to the accompaniment of the
usual harborside parties, a terrific traffic-
jam and lukewarm applause. Atalanta
Fairey (fabulous name!) arrived with her
husband, aircraft - manufacturer Mr.
Richard Fairey, and was quizzed about
why she had' “given her baby away” in
1957 (her mother, Lady Clifford, cares
for it), and gave the same reasons—that
her husband, who is legless, needs her
care more. Actually, Mrs. Fairey is by
no means unique in renouncing claims
to her baby. Quite a number of parents
do it if they feel they cannot care for
the child as well as adoptive parents


could. But, of course, they don’t
announce their intention.

What would Captain Cook or
Governor Phillip have thought of the
country they founded had they been
in Sydney on Anniversary Day, 1959?,
It’s very likely they would have been
very happy about it, for although much
that they envisaged has not been realised,
the sight of the yachts on the Harbor
in the Anniversary Day Regatta, the
spectacular aquatic display in Farm
Cove, representing the renown that Aus-
tralian swimmers have won for them-
selves throughout the world, the march
through the streets with its R.S.L., re-
minders of what Australia has done in
the defence of freedom, the cricket-match
between England and N.S.W. giving such
a pleasant evidence of continuing- ties
with Britain, the happy surfers on so
many beaches, family parties and
vigorous athletes, the plays and choral
items at the pageant in St. Leonard’s

Among the weddings of the week was
that of Rosemary Powell, eldest daughter
of St. Stephen’s well-known padre, the
Rev. Gordon Powell, and Mrs. Powell,
who married Murray Jacques, son of
Mr. and Mrs. W. Jacques, of Marrick-
ville. Given away by her father, the
bride wore white nylon-organza over
pink tulle, and was attended by her
sisters Marjorie and Jennifer and by
Sandra Powell and Margaret Rutherford,
both of Melbourne.

Melbourne was well represented, too,
at the wedding of Kathleen Nelson,
second daughter of the N. C. L. Nelsons,
of Gordon, to Frank Costigan, son of
Mr. and Mrs. J. Costigan, of Preston
(Vic.). The bride’s uncle, Father P.
Shanahan, came from Guyra to perform
the ceremony, which was held at the
Sacred Heart Church, Pymble. Wearing
a beautiful dress of white satin, the bride
was attended by Dollis McClemens, Mary
Ruhan and the bridegroom’s 14-year-old
sister, Anne. The wedding-reception was
held at St. Malo, Hunter’s Hill.

Another wedding of wide interest was
that of Robin Corner, who married
Wyndham Rofe at St. Stephen’s Church,
Macquarie Street. She is the younger
daughter of Dr. and Mrs. L. S. Corner
(Vaucluse), and the bridegroom is the
third son of the late Mr. W. Rofe and
of Mrs. Rofe, of Rose Bay. The bride
chose white silk-taffeta for her gown, and
was attended by Mrs. P. McGrath, Helen
Hayes and Margaret Treweeke, who also
wore white silk-taffeta, but street-length
in contrast to the bride’s dress, which
was ankle-length at the front, sweeping
to a full train at the back.
The charm of simplicity in interior-
decorating is well illustrated at the Japa-
nese Trade Fair at the Trocadero. Here
one sees bowls, trays, wall-vases, china,
chairs and tables dependent for their
beauty wholly on purity of line, with
little or no decoration to distract from
that line, and color used with restraint.
There are bamboo-tables and -chairs, set
low to the ground, which would blend
in well with the Australian idea of out-
door living. Even the partitions of
waxed - paper, wood and panels which
represent the walls of a Japanese house
will provide inspiration for Australian
home-decoration.
Bettie Dickinson, who plays the part
of the secretary-model in the Independent
Theatre’s new production, “The Fifth
Season,” is a versatile young woman. She
has trained as a model, has studied ballet
to the point at which she is qualified to
teach, is a professional hairdresser and
is receptionist to a well-known Sydney
firm of hairdressers. Her interest in
amateur theatricals brought her to the
notice of Miss Doris Fitton when she
appeared in the Wollongong Workshop
Theatre’s production of “The Two Mrs.
Carrolls,” and since coining to Sydney
from Wollongong she has studied at the
Independent, appearing in “Children in
Uniform” and now in this new lively
comedy, produced bf? Olive Walter. Her
photo is by Montgomery Dunn.
Scots gathered 850 strong for the con'
cert and supper at the Town Hall to
commemorate the Robert Burns Bi-
centenary celebrations. The kilt was
worn, tartan sashes decorated many an
evening-gown and the haggis was piped
in before supper by the Police Pipe Band
which was in attendance through the
evening. This band, by the way, wears
the Mackay tartan. The main oration
on Burns was given by the Rev. J. Gray
Roberton, and included among the guests
were Sir William and Lady McKell ; the
Hon. Hugh Roberton (Minister for
Social Services); Mr. George Smith
(Deputy Commissioner of Police and
president of the Burns Society) with Mrs.
Smith: Sir Ronald Grieve; the Rev.
Dr. and Mrs. Malcolm Mackay; Mr.
Bruce MacLeod (president of the Clan
MacLeod) and Mrs. MacLeod.

The father of the bride at one of the
week’s weddings remarked that the word
“to wed” had among its meanings “to
pawn,” and humorously (we imagine)
added that it certainly applied to him
that day. He did not mention, however,
the Webster’s dictionary gives the mean-
ing “to take to oneself and support” as
obsolete. Perhaps he did not want to put
such an idea into the bridegroom’s head.
CANBERRA
For the tenth Australian Citizenship
Convention the Albert Hall was dressed
with flags of all nationalities, and on
the lawns in front of the hall eight coun-
tries were represented in a series of
settings portraying the color and culture
of each with unusual vividness. Back-
grounds for the settings were designed
by Czech artist Kamil Kubik. Inside
the hall a huge canvas depicted the first
settlement in Australia 171 years ago,
with superimposed scenes of present-day
life.
The Governor-General. Sir William
Slim, opened the convention. With him
on the dais were Lady Slim (who wore
a turquoise-blue frock with small match-
ing flowered hat); the Minister for
Immigration and Mrs. A. R. Downer;
Dame Pattie Menzies ; Lord and Lady
Carrington (his point that too much
publicity is given to the odd disgruntled
British migrant and not enough to those
who made a go of it being well taken);
Dr. and Mrs. H. V. Evatt; the Hon.
A. C. Atkins, M.H.A.; Mr. K. C.
Wilson, M.P.; and Major Gordon and
Miss Lester, who attended the Governor-
General and Lady Slim.
After the speeches, rather lengthy for
heat - wave conditions, the Governor-
General presented the Gertrude Kumm
Award for Citizenship to Russian-born
Mr. A. P. Saranin, of Bundaberg, who
migrated here in 1951.
Following the opening, delegates were
entertained at a late-afternoon reception
in the Speaker’s Courtyard at Parliament
House, where they were received by Mr.
and Mrs. Downer (her navy silk frock
patterned with large white daisies was
worn with a small green flowered hat)
and by Dame Pattie Menzies, who also
chose navy, softly patterned in muted
pinks. Lord and Lady Carrington were
at the party, her elegant dark-blue silk
frock featuring a pleated frill hemline ;
also Mr. and Mrs. Marcus Daly (he is
director of the Inter-Governmental Com-
mittee for European Migration) who
came from Geneva for the convention ;
and Mr. and Mrs. G. J. van Keulen, who
jointly presented a paper entitled
“Assimilation or Integration?” for dis-
cussion at the convention.


two minds as to the enduring value of
Debussy’s music:—
Any student at a music-school
can now reproduce the tricks of
Debussy’s style, and therefore it is
now, and only now, that we can
discover whether Debussy had
something genuine to say...
Not a very optimistic outlook! And,
for those who consider Debussy the
archangel of free impressionism,
Honegger bluntly says
Absolute originality does not exist.
Despite the prodigious novelty of
his contributions, Debussy had his
precursors. Certain of the last
piano pieces of Liszt are not so
distant from Debussy’s Preludes.
Debussy, on page 324, is noticeably
silent on this point; but he does relate,
in typically cynical fashion, how an
American woman journalist came to
ask his advice on bringing-up little
American geniuses. Debussy told her
that her compatriots should invent a
machine “into which one can put any
child, rendering him a complete artist
in five minutes.”
One of the book’s many surprises
is the diversity of opinion concerning
Brahms. No one, it seems, can agree
on whether he is worthy to stand
beside Beethoven, whether or not he
was clinically obsessed with musical
structures —whether, in fact, he is much
of a musician at all. Variations on this
enigma begin with Schumann, who,
naturally enough, lets himself go:—
Even outwardly he (Brahms) bore
the signs which proclaimed “This
is a chosen one.” Sitting at the
piano he began to disclose wonder-
ful regions to us....he is a per-
former of genius who can make of
the piano an orchestra of lamenting
and loudly jubilant voices....
sonatas, songs, sonatas for violin
and piano, string quartets, every
work so different from the others
that they seemed to stream from
their own individual source....in
him, we welcome a strong champion.
But Lalo, the “Symphonie
Espagnole” man, will have none of
this: —
Brahms is an inferior spirit whose
pickaxe has probed every nook of
counterpoint and modern harmony.
This is his only recommendation.
He is not a born musician ; his
inventiveness is always insignificant
and imitative.
Tschaikowsky:—
The Concerto (violin) of Brahms
does not please me better than any
of his other works. He is certainly
a great musician, even a Master, but
his mastery overwhelms his inspira-
tion.... .Brahms, as a musical per-
sonality, is antipathetic to me.
Hugo Wolf, writing about Brahms’s
Third Symphony, takes time off to
generalise:—
He is a proficient musician who
knows his counterpoint, to whom
occur ideas now and then good,
occasionally excellent, now and then
bad, here and there familiar, and
frequently no ideas at all.
There are other references, some
kind, some uncertain, some damning.
Max Reger, for instance, considers
Brahms “the greatest composer since
Beethoven”; Charles Ives deliberates
that Brahms indulges in muddy orches-
tration, putting forward the thought
that “the mud may be a form of sin-
cerity which demands that the heart be
translated, rather than handed around
through the pit”; all of which contrasts
gently with Neville Cardus’s spirited
cry in his “Ten Composers”:—
If I were compelled immediately
to go and live for years on the
desert isle of which so much has
been"heard, and if I were allowed to
lake with me only one composer, I
think it would be Brahms.
But the book is valuable, particu-
larly from the student’s point of view,
in its many authoritative slabs of
advice. On the question of rubato
playing in Chopin, Virgil Thomson
says:—
Chopin’s prescription for rubato-
playing... .is that the right hand
should take liberties with the time
values, while the left hand remains
rhythmically unaltered.
Along the same lines, this .time
referring to the use of pedal in Chopin,
Debussy points out that
Chopin wished his works to be
practiced without pedal, and with
but very rare exceptions, he did not
wish it used at all.
Chopin, then, must have been more
of a virtuoso than one imagines; either
that or he expected wonders of piano
students. In his Nocturnes it seems
to me a fairly constant use of the pedal
is inescapable; certainly in rubato
passages, where a left-hand chord must
SUBURBAN THEME

High on an opposite hill
Hung with carnival light
The television masts
Propel into the night,
Enlarging sound and sight.
But this is our place of choice
For house and children,
For love,'and growth and departure
And for the time when
We shall grow old —a mellow grace for
then.
A lovely place for a child
Who, for the first time, sees
Still water for the drowning of eyes,
The doubling of boats and trees;
Still water of green depth for tales and
mysteries.
Where somehow the people yet
Escape the flavorless, sad
Normality of the Joneses —
To be really good or bad;
And enough of them are mad
For children to treasure,
To cherish, to wonder or pity
At the dignified human condition
Of glad diversity
And each man's right to choose his
eccentricity.

Where I lived as a child
An ancient driftwood sailor
Stumped on his wooden fate
Across our tears and laughter.
Two curious twin women
Of no age and no fashion
Of past, present or future
Were all our fear and repression.
Each day the nurses flirted
Their charges to the park ;
How all the starched children
Hated their lovely walk!
The world was full of grown
Implacable enemies
And huge houses smelling
Of wax and certainties.
So we knew we were children.
Out of ourselves we spun
A recondite anti-world
For our salvation:
A universe of kitchens
Steamy, dark and full
Of indulgent cooks and cats and food
Forbidden and beautiful,
Of walls and walls of books,
Houses in unsafe trees,
Discarded gramophone
And a harbor hooting with ferries.
Love there was, and to spare,
But we —dreaming and wayward
Fed on the queer, the perverse,
The gloriously mad.
. . . So, in the new suburbs,
Each house a tidy pen,
I wonder flow the children
Know they are children?

"Naked Island" Sequel
Russell Braddon begins End of a
Hate, a Sequel to “The Naked Island”
(Cassell) with the story of his enlarge-
ment from Changi, his return to Aus-
tralia, the wild and casual scenes of
his demobilisation, his efforts to return
to law at the University of Sydney, his
breaking away to London, hook-up
with the Piddingtons (Mrs. Lesley
Piddington had replaced him in the
telepathy-act he and Piddington used
to practice in prison-camp), his writing
of “The Naked Island” (more than a
million sold), lectures, encounters with
Kitty Bluett (who received threatening
letters, but when she screamed and
denounced a face at the window all
they apprehended was a couple of kids
anxious to see what they could of a
star undressing), Judy Fallon (who
says no war because of the airy
fashions), Hermione Gingold (who,
asked on a New York TV-panel why
the English burnt Joan of Arc,
replied: “But, darling, because we were
cold, of course.”), and a woman who
entered a provincial bookshop where
Braddon was sitting to autograph
copies of his book, the proprietor
having tea at the back of the shop;
she made Braddon stand, examined
Christmas-cards, picked out two-dozen,
told him to wrap them—and while he
was fumbling with the parcel, the pro-
prietor returned, took in the situation,
explained that Braddon was not a lazy
assistant but “a distinguished author
specially invited down to his shop so
that I might sign copies of books”: —
Madam looked me up and down
suspiciously. Then she made up her
mind. “In that case,” she snapped,
“sign this one.” And she passed me
her latest library book by Fransoise
Sagan.
It is an extraordinarily gay book,
and it is as satisfying to the reader as
it must be to the author to think that
a survivor of Changi should have
spread such a sparkling dozen-or-so
years over Australia, England and
America. But when, in the last chap-
ter, he comes to justify his title, one
finds that “End of a Hate” means
that Braddon doesn’t hate the Japanese
any more, but he doesn’t believe that
they won’t come again:—
Japan is a proud nation of people
whose tradition is warlike and whose
instinct is to look backwards to
death and the example of ancestors
rather than forwards to peace and
the benefit of posterity. She should
be weaned away from her natural
urge for self-destruction by being
allowed to forget for ever the
appalling loss of face she endured
because of allied occupation. She
can only do this if the fetters of
present-day American economic and
military aid are promptly severed.
For the same reason Okinawa should
be restored to her....
Both Japanese and Chinese fight
with incredible ferocity and tenacity
and —when they choose their own
battlefield and their own moment —
always with annihilating success.
Soon, if we continue to provoke both
(the one through perpetual loss of
face: the other through perpetual
hostility) they will unite
The book concludes with a short-
story, “Song of War,” in which a
British patrol encounters a Japanese
patrol in Burma, and a dying Scotsman
and a dying Japanese exchange expres-
sions of mutual goodwill. It is well
told, and the reader is made to see that
such circumstances might guarantee
feelings of peace and charitableness;
but there may be also a macabre wit
in it—does Braddon feel that this is
the only way to peace?
Essays in Education
Melbourne Studies in Education,
1956-7, edited by E. L. French
(Melbourne University Press), is the
first of a proposed annual book of
essays on education: this volume has
three main headings: “Student Failure
at the University,” “The History of
Education in South Australia” and
“Education in France.”
Melbourne University’s Professor of
Education, W. H. Frederick, opens
with a survey of “The Components of
Failure”; he quotes a Scottish report,
“Our schools are full of good teaching
and poor learning,” and goes on to
discuss, what at first may seem surpris-
ing, but is obviously a practical point,
the inability of students to read at
speed. Then there is “wastage”—of
the 99 per cent, of Victorian children
at school at 13, only 6 per cent, are
there at 18. R. R. Priestley, student-
counsellor at Melbourne University,
writes on “The Mental Health of
Students,” taking for granted what
might seem to a visitor from another
planet an uproarious farce of bad
management in that, at an age when
they are racked by the tortures of sex
and the vision of insecurity, the youth
of this earth are expected to make the
most delicate distinctions of language
and explore the most rarefied and com-
plicated systems of mathematics, finds
that of about 1000 students a year
during three years who have sought
counsel, 16 per cent, had family, physi-
cal or mental problems of personal-
medical type, but 48 per cent, were
merely worried about the future or had
trouble in settling to study or in learn-
ing and reading.
Douglas Pike, who does the three
associated essays on education in
South Australia, makes an amusing
continuity, not without acerbity, on the
reluctance of South Australian parents
to have free education forced upon
them; his remarks resolve largely into
studies of Dr. William Wyatt as a
patriarchal reactionary, and John
Anderson Hartley as a man who got
things done.
In her essay on “The Crisis in
French Education,” Olive Wykes, Mel-
bourne University Lecturer in Educa-
tion, shows what unsuspected quick-
sands underlie the present-day forma-
tion of what the world so vastly
respects, the logical, supremely sophis-
ticated French Mind —short of 20,000
teachers, they are as worried as Aus-
tralians over whether Roman Catholic
schools, which in France have the
immemorial tradition of education,
should be State-subsidised; and as
worried as at Sydney’s new University
over the question of teaching the
humanities to the increasingly import-
ant classes of learned engineers: the
latest solution seems to be to make
engineers of some and to humanise
others.
The volume ends, as with liqueurs,
with a recondite study of “The Myth
of Paris,” by S. J. Scott, Melbourne
University Lecturer in French; a
raking-over of the historical and
literary sources of the dream-life
of Paris that make it the home-town
of the world’s artists and the shrine
of poets:—
....the Pont-Neuf (a focal-point
for medieval songsters, whose com-
positions are, in fact, remembered
as ponts-neufs), Notre-Dame, Saint-
Germain-des Pres, Montmartre, have
lost none of their eloquence and
continue to give off a music as
binding as that of Orpheus.
A Person from England: Fitzroy
Maclean (Cape). An unusual combina-
tion of travel-book, history and spy-
drama, describing the manoeuvres of
British and Russian agents in Turkes-
tan in the 19th century and later. It
is a most interesting story, and the
author knows the country at first-hand.
