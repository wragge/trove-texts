The Red Page
Life Among the Eminent.
“The Nineteen Hundreds,” by Reginald
Auberon.
(George Allen & Unwin.)
It was said on this, page, last month, that
the English libel laws precluded the publi-
cation in London of a book of memoirs like
James L. Ford’s “Forty-odd Years in the
Literary Shop.” When that opinion was
offered the writer had not seen Reginald
Auberon’s The Nineteen Hundreds. There
is material on which a normal British jury
might fairly be expected to provide damages
in almost every chapter of it. Auberon, like
Ford, is a journalist. But he is young, and
he has a keener sense of humor than his
sexagenarian Yankee rival in the business
of gossip-mongering. He also has a nicer
literary sense, more skill in turning a phrase,
and he is not nearly so sincere. This last is
only to say, however, that being a middle-
class Englishman, he is a snob. The dis-
tinguishing mark of the English snob is that
he is ashamed of his little weakness; and
he is thus driven into a morass of humbug,
since he is equally ashamed of being thought
basely-born or unknown to the successful.
We begin to suspect our author in the first
page or two: he protests too much.
If anybody expects to find constant references in
the following chapters to people whose names figure
in the peerage and similar works lie (or she) will
be. disappointed. The fact is I don’t know any of
the nobility intimately enough to write about them.
1 have, however (and just to show that I do move
in good society), been on nodding terms with the
sons of two peers. One of them had been in a lunatic
asylum, and the other ought to have been.
I give you fair warning. This book is all about
Nobodies, and is written by one of them.
But, for the Lord’s sake, don’t imagine he is
one of the'Nobodies you. mean; the son of a
nouveau riche, say, or of a tradesman —
two classes for whom he has a bitter con-
tempt. His great-grandfather “finished up
in the gaiters of a dean”; his grandfather
wrote a book which was given to the world
as “by a member of the. aristocracy” (though,
actually, the poor man was only a member
of the Indian Civil Service) ; and his father
was a' clergyman. The reader is now in a
receptive condition to learn that the posses-
sor of these socially desirable forebears began
life in London with little or no money. Pov-
erty lends added picturesquesness to the up-
ward struggle when one iS the great-grand-
son of a dean. If this book had really been
written about Nobodies —meaning people
whose achievements had not earned them a
niche in any of the reference books —it
would be as dull as the typical Nobody is.
In point of fact, it is extremely interesting:
it bristles with funny and scandalous stories
(many indecent, a few old, but all
worth their place for the clever way. they
are told ) ; and it is concerned almost en-
tirely with people whose names are in
“Debrett,” “Who’s Who,” “Who’s Who on
the Stage,” “Who’s Who in Literature”
and similar compilations. Mr. Auberon men-
tions that in one of his clubs the membership
list included Hilaire Belloc, Laurence Bin-
yon, Lord Dunsany, Gilbert Frankau,
Maurice Hewlett, Compton Mackenzie,
Walter do la Mare and Henry Newbolt —a
fairly impressive list of important people
in itself. And, then,, he has interesting
stories about the Trees, Frederick Curzon
(“a son of Lord Howe”), Hall Caine, Wells.
Watts-Dunton, Viscountess Rhondda, Arnold
Bennett, Sir Algernon West, Baron v,on
Eekhardstein. Mrs. Humphry Ward, Somerset.
Maugham and Lady Randolph Churchill —all
of whom he seems to have known more or
less intimately. He makes no secret of his
dislikes. He will not even write the name
of The Pink ’lTn —which, for good or ill,
was one of the best-known journals in the
Empire during the period he is discussing;—
Under the pseudonym of the “Dwarf of Blood,”
Newnham-Davis was a great standby of a somewhat
Rabelaisian organ (eonducted by a bottle-nosed racing
man named John Corlett), and could always be de-
pended on to turn out at short notice a column of
quite readable journalism. This curious paper was
not really half so indecent as it pretended to be,
and was immensely popular among office-boys, bar-
loafers, touts, subalterns, undergraduates, etc. Yet
it certainly had some clever people on its staff, for
despite his taproom proclivities, the proprietor knew
his business. The best of the batch was Spencer-
Mott, who elected to he known as “Gnbbins.” An
odd'taste. Still, entirely his own affair.
This extract gives s a fair idea, both of his
style and of his Quality as a critic. The
besjt man the SpoftjiptG Times ever had—
and one of the in his limited line
any English papef^vij^yhad—was Arthur

published volume I have actually encountered refer-
ences to Lady Alfred Butt, and to Lady Arthur

Such japses are inexcusable. Nearly every society
paper has a very sound etiquette column ; and Whit-
aker, too, which has a perfectly reliable “Mode of
Addresses” feature, can always be borrowed from
somebody.
A most diverting volume; but, perhaps, when
all is said and done, this is about the best
thing in it.
Trials at Song
The title poem, which occupies 20-odd
pages of Nimrod No More, a Post-War
Memorial, by Ern. Chancellor (Alexander
McCubbin, Melbourne), looks like a young
effort to say something very big. There is
a good deal of color, some strength in the
phrasing of individual lines, and for the most
part the rhythmic movement is pleasing;
but the pictures are rather extravagant, and
the great world-reform which is represented
as being the result of the war has a rather
insane look. In a new world a new temple
is built with a top reaching to Heaven
which no longer invites the curse that fell
on Nimrod and his builders. Previously the
ships on their way to the new shores had
engaged in a sort of Maypole dance; and
there, were other curious things. Take as
an example of the verse at its best the open-
ing of Part II.:
A day of holiday. Then eager rose
The energy that sweetens life in toil —
Cleansing the fretfulness like wind that blows
Cool life across the suffocated soil.
Some tilled, some sang, some wrought the sapless
wood,
Some robbed the fluid airs of power. And he
Whose heart beat most, throughout the common-good
Was crowned with love —and wore it worthilyl
All, making life’s investment, set apart
The coins no more of mercenary earth;
But gave in trust to every fellow heart
The native capital of human worth.
If Ern, Chancellor is as young as his work
suggests ho might do something better in
the years to come.
Voices on the Wind; An Anthology of
Contemporary Verse (the Merton P'ress,
Birmingham). The preface, by S. Fowler
Wright, indicates that the selection of verse
is his, and claims for it a very high place
on the ground that the book is “more varied
in its contents and more catholic in its sym-
pathies” than other compilations of current
poetry. Unfortunately, the volume can
hardly be said to live up to this claim; for
the monotony of slight merit marks it all.
There are probably 50 writers of verse in
England—none of" tljem represented here—
whose poorest work is equal to the best in
this collection. Some of the verses selected
are bad ; many are readable; nearly all are
thin and weak.
Here is a fair sapiple of the sort of thing
which the anthologist’s “catholic” sympathy
and desire for something more “varied” have
led him to include: —
From God’s own hand thou cam’st to me,
The last, best gift His love could give;
It seemed a better thing to live,
Brighter the world, for holding thee.
A nobler courage came to me,
A stronger heart to do and dare;
I breathed in a diviner air,
In those brief hours I trod by thee.
Though thou no more canst walk by me,
The same blue sky' is overhead.
The same firm earth beneath our tread.
The same dear God is guiding thee.
And still the Vision tells of thee,
That though our lives awhile divide,
I yet shall find thee at my side
In God’s own hands kept safe for me.
That is called “Friendship,” and is by B. M.
Skeat. It is simply a feeble echo of an idea
that has become commonplace with constant
use. The recipe for it is : To one dull hour
add half-a-teaspoonful of Tennyson’s “In
Memoriam.” Stir well, and pour in slowly
eight to ten gallons of lukewarm water. Of
course, there are some far worse things in
this anthology, but, unfortunately, there are
not very many better things. _ To call the
book an anthology of mediocrity would
hardly be fair to the mediocre; it is not
quite' as good as that. To call it “Voices
on the Wind,” as the selector has done, is
to seriously mislead. The verses are just
scratehings on paper without enough “voice”
for any wind to carry. The explanation of
it all is that S. Fowler Wright is the editor
of “Poetry”—a small magazine devoted to
the verse that nobody else cares to publish.
A companion volume to the present one is
to be issued “containing selections from the
best work of Dominion and Colonial writers.”
The statement sounds like a serious threat.
Off Mudros, 1915, and Other Poems, by
,T. E. S. Henerie (Morland, Amersham,
Bucks). Although published in England,
these verses appear to be by an Australian,
or, at least, by one who has lived in Sydney.
The work is rather uneven. At times it
suggests a young writer of promise; at
/others it cries loudly for the waste-paper
basket. Henerie can be as bad as this: —
SvpP' When dawn-clouds tinge the dusky east,
And warn the lithe opossums
v -- their lairs and quit the feast
, 'SSSSb vffhguin leaves and blossoms,
pipes her flute-like lay

But he cflh also he as good as this: —

which is very poor. Still, the book as a
whole is a charming little production, and
will enable many Australians to hear in
fancy the songs of the thrushes and warblers
which fill so large a place in the classic
poetry of the language.
The Infamous Rich
The Nobleman Jackcroo, by. M. Egan-
Mulry (Simpson, IlaJligan, Brisbane), is,
as the title implies, a novel of high Ute
in Australia. The central figure—it were
profanation to call him hero —is "the Hon-
orable Henry Plantagenet Somerville, scion
of a royal English house.” Fortunately
there are not many such employed on our
Queensland stations. After wreaking his
evil will on the homestead cook’s beautiful
daughter (herself of noble birth, though she
knows it not, insofar as her father is an
English knight), lie declines to make an
honest woman of the girl when it becomes
conspicuously urgent that he should do so.
Instead, he‘offers himself to the wealthy,
but otherwise undesirable, daughter of the
squatter for whom he is supposed to be
working. The wedding is a typical bush
affair: —
The rosy hue of the eastern sky heralded the
coming of the King of Day, who rose in all the
splendor of an Australian sunrise, as though to greet
in unison the glorious God of Day. Not a cloud
appeared on the horizon to dim the brightness and
beauty of the day as the morning advanced. Surely
no bride ever had a fairer prospect of happiness.
She wore a most beautiful gown, imported for the
occasion from Paris, as no expense was too great
to do honor to the noble bridegroom.... The appointed
hour came, and at a given signal the huge station-
bell clanged forth the joyful news, the sound being
echoed and re-echoed in a thousand echoes from
the surrounding hills. At the first and second note
of the bell the organ was silent. At the third the
music-stool was occupied by a friend of the bride’s,
and the organ pealed forth in joyous storm: ‘‘Behold
the Bride Cometh!”
Almost simultaneously the bride entered leaning
on her brother’s arm, and a fine type of Australian
manhood lie looked. Mr. Crosby was also there in
the capacity of best man.
Now all are assembled: the bride and bridegroom
stand before the clergyman, who, book in hand,
is asking the usual question: “Is there any man
here present who has any objection to this man
and this woman being joined in marriage? If so, let
him speak now or for ever hold his peace.”
There was a death-like silence in the room for a
moment.
All eyes were turned in the direction of the
hall, where a dishevelled figure, with cap awry and
a white bundle in her arms, was trying to get in.
At last she fo*ced her way into the room, where
the ceremony was about to take place, and cried out:
“I forbid the marriage! My child! My child!
He has killed my child!”
The words did not reach the bride, for consider-
ate hands removed the poor intruder before any
were aware of her meaning. Mr. Crosby alone of all
the guests (and there were quite a hundred, if not
more, present) took in their meaning. The function
had no more interest for him. Immediately after
the ceremony no inducement would get him to
remain any longer to support the bridegroom.
There could be no true happiness in an
alliance contracted under such auspices, and
the canker-worm of mutual abhorrence is
soon to be observed at work :
Meanwhile, our hero, the Honorable Henry, and his
bride are doing the beauty spots of New South
Wales and Victoria. No one has taken them for a
newly-wedded bride and bridegroom. It seems as
if the Hon. Henry avoided his Wife’s society as
much as possible. They rarely went out together,
and when they did the words exchanged were but
few. They were now on their homeward journey
and staying at the Hotel Metropole, Sydney, for a
few days’ rest after returning from Now Zealand—
where thev had recently been. One evening, just as
he was about to dress for dinner, the Hon. Henry
was handed a cable message. He read it and
crushed the paper in his hand, whilst his face went
white. He muttered
“What cursed fate! Why didn’t this happen 14,
months ago?” , .
“What has happened, Henry?” broke m the icy
tones of his three-months’ bride.
“Allow me to be the first to congratulate you, ’
handing her the message. “You are the 14th Coun-
tess of Clarendon, with an income of £20,000 for
your own special use, independent of your husband;
three country seats in England, a shooting-box m
Scotland and a hunting-lodge in Ireland; with a
house in London, one in Paris and one in Berlin.’
Whilst he was still speaking, his wife stepped
into her own room, and taking out her writing-
desk, commenced writing rapidly. The Hon. Henry
remained standing. Onee he put liis hands over his
eyes as if to shut out some unpleasant sight.
His wife’s voice once more aroused him.
“Henry,” she said, “I’ve just sent an excuse to
Lord and Ladv Malcombe. We cannot, of course, dine
with this sort of person now—as you know, Lady
Malcombe helped in her husband’s soap-factory.,, I
have also engaged the entire first flat of the hotel.
No need to follow the wretched pair to their
gilded doom. A few more such exposures ot
the activities of the British leisured classes
in our midst, and the A.D.C. or It.N. officer
who adventures into the Backblocks in search
of a wife capable of supporting him in the
style to which lie has been accustomed will
do' it at the risk of being shot on sight by
infuriated station-hands.
Flotsam and Jetsam
Writing seems (on the surface) such an
msy way of earning a living that it is not
surprising that many of life s misfits have
turned to the pen to help them butter the
parsnips. The number that failed or tired
must be enormous, but the successes show
many unusual careers among the prominent
writers of the day.
Algernon Blackwood, son of Sir Arthur
Blackwood, K.C.8., and the Duchess of
Manchester, educated at Wellington College
and Edinburgh University, has been a dairy
farmer in Canada; he prospected in the Rainy
River goldfields, ran a hotel, went on the
stage, posed to artists (Charles Dana Gib-
son, among them), taught French, German
and the violin, was a reporter on the N.Y.
Sun and Times, went into the dried-milk
business, and translated stories from the
French. He has been penniless, and has
lived on dried apples and raw rice. A friend
encouraged him in 1906 to try to sell some
of his ghost stories. In three years he was
a success, and now spends his time travel-
ling round the world and writing.
This record is equalled by only two other
living English writers: W. H. Davies and
John Masefield.
Davies ran away from home as a b
went to the U.S.A., and spent eight years
as a tramp, picking fruit, doing odd jobs,
sleeping in the open, in cheap lodging-houses,
or in gaol. He lost a foot trying to “jump a
rattler,” or, in English, steal a ride on a
goods-train. He crossed the Atlantic many
times on cattle-boats. Ultimately he in-
herited a small legacy, but continued tramp-
ing until his capital had accumulated to
such an extent that he could publish his
first volume of verse. It failed, but he sent
a copy to Bernard Shaw, with a letter.
After that his waggon was hitched to a star.
John Masefield ran away from school and
lived a vagabond life on sea and land for
years. He, also, went to America —and
starved there. He sang on the streets, used
free lunches for sustenance, and worked as
a bar-tender in a N.Y. hotel. While in a
carpet factory in Yonkers he bought a
Chaucer for 75 cents, and decided (at 28)
to become a poet. He began as a hack-
writer, but after meeting Jack Yeats, who
gave him his first real start, “he never looked
back.”
Blackwood, Davies and Masefield among
English writers have had the most melo-
dramatic lives, but many others have been
exciting—at least externally; it is to be
assumed, perhaps, that they all had internal
excitement in plenty !
Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham,
Laird of Ardoeh, is famous for his
adventurous life in out-of-the-way places.
Joseph Conrad, born in the Ukraine, son of
political exiles, chose to become a British
seaman, and ended as a master in the
Mercantile Marine. He published his
first novel, “Almayer’s Folly,” at the sugges-
tion of John Galsworthy, who happened to
be travelling on a ship Conrad commanded.
Conrad married an English wife. He thinks
out his work in Polish, expresses it in
French, and finally turns it into English for
publication! He speaks English with some
difficulty still. Galsworthy himself has trav-
elled extensively, but his life has been rela-
tively free of adventure. Stephen Graham
has tramped the Caucasus, Crimea, Ural
Mountains and the Russian Far North. He
accompanied a Russian peasant pilgrimage
to Jerusalem, and went to New York with
a party of Russian immigrants. Thence he
tramped to (Jhieago, and further west. He
has also travelled in Central Asia, Egypt,
Bulgaria and Roumania. Marmaduke Pick-
thall lived for years in Syria and Egypt,
and for a year among the Druses of Mount
Lebanon. W. T. Hudson, born in the pam-
pas of La Plata, had seen no city (except
Buenos Ayres) until he was a young man
He has lived the wild life his books describe,
and knows what revolutions are like from the
inside. William McFee was apprenticed in
an engineering shop, and ultimately went to
sea as an engineer, remaining there ever
since. He was engineer on a British trans-
port during the war. Francis Ledwidge,
poet and friend of Lord Dunsany, worked as
a miner, grocer’s clerk, scavenger and hypno-
tist ( !) before (at 26) he was killed in
Flanders. W. L. George has experimented
with many professions: he has been a chem-
ist, an engineer, a barrister (he holds a
University degree), a soldier and a business
man. He was born in Paris and served in
the French Army during the war. Stephen
McKenna has travelled four continents.
Compton Mackenzie was associated, with
the famous Pelissier, of “The Follies,” in
producing plays, and travelled widely
before settling down in his villa at Capri.
. Sir Harry Johnston explored unknown
Africa, held consular office there, and led
a special commission into Uganda, before
deciding to exploit the unwritten parts of
the lives of Dickens’s characters. H. G.
Wells, as everyone knows, won, -from a
drapery emporium, a mastership in a small
school, and a London University Science
Course, to the pedestal of world-adviser.
Leonard Merrick was christened Leon-
ard Miller, but legally adopted his
stage-name. He was intended for the
Bar, but his father’s financial re-
verses saved him. He worked in South
Africa as a foreman in a diamond-mine, and
in a solicitor’s office, and became sin actor
and actor-manager. Edwin Pugh, novelist
and critic, began to earn his living at 13,
worked in an iron factory till his health
gave way, and then got work as a clerk,
studying and reading at night. Sarah
Grand gave him his first lift. James Elroy
Flecker travelled France and Italy, and was
in the British Consular service at Constan-
tinople, Smyrna and Beirut before he died
of phthisis at Davos Platz in 1915. James
Joyce, whose “Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man” and “Ulysses” have been flut-
tering the dovecots, is an unfrocked priest:
and now teaches in a commercial school
in Trieste. Charles Marriott started out
as a photographer, became a chemist (work-
ing as such in an asylum for two years)
and finally made a success with “The
Column” in 1901. Francis E. Brett Young
was trained as a doctor, experimented with
novels and served in East Africa during the
war. James Stephens spent a large part of
his youth with travelling tinkers in Ireland,
and was finally discovered by A.E. keeping
a wife and child on 265. per week, which he
received as a typist in a solicitor’s office in
Dublin. Eden Phillpotts, son of an Indian
Army officer, spent 10 years, from the age
of 17 onwards, in a fire-insurance office. He
then tried acting and art before the pen
landed him. Charles Montagu Doughty, tra-
veller and poet, a graduate of both Oxford
and Cambridge, lived for years among the
Arabs, and holds the Royal Founder’s medal
of the Royal Geographical Society. Horace
Annesley Vacliell entered the army, resigned,
went to America to shoot buffaloes, and re-
mained in California as a rancher for 17
years. J. D. Beresford, seriously injured as
an infant through a nurse’s carelessness,
and still lame, was an architect and a journal-
ist before publishing any fiction. Edward
Carpenter was, at his own request, removed
from the ministry, went to America to meet
Walt Whitman, was a university extension
lecturer in science, fell in love with the
working class, went to live in it, working
at a trade, went to Ceylon to visit an Indian
Gnani, and now lives at his cottage, near
Sheffield. Conan Doyle practised medicine and
travelled widely, in the Arctic regions and
tropical Africa, before inventing, first, Sher-
lock Holmes, and then, another world. Pat-
rick Mac Gill worked as a farm servant, byre-
man, drainer, potato-digger, surfaceman,
navvy and journalist.
It would be interesting to examine the
careers of these men in relation to their
work. Perhaps (in psycho-analytic wise)
it might be possible to propound a theory to
the effect that the more exciting the ‘life
the more peaceful the work. Certainly, many
bloodthirsty volumes have been produced by
men (and women) whose conception of land-
scape was based on no more than an experi-
ence of city parks. But I shall abandon
the temptation to theorise, leave it to the
reader, and content myself with the observa-
tion that, in Charles Lamb’s phrase, they
are, taken in the mass, certainly “odd fish.”
J. S.
A Satchel of Books
The Inheritance of Jean Trouve, by Nevil Hen-
shaw (Hutchinson). The tale of an orphaned youth
and the thing’s that happen to him before he acquires
wealth and a wife. Most of the characters are of
French origin, and their amiabilities and peculiari-
ties are etched in artfully by a writer who is evi-
dently well acquainted with New Orleans and its
surroundings. Most interest will be centred in the
little girl, Toinette, who ultimately hugs the hero
on the last page, but the simple-minded will shed a
tear for her noble-hearted but thirsty father, who
boozes away his income and pathetically perishes
half-way through.
The Street of the Gazelle, by Dulcie Deamer. A
story of New Testament days in Palestine, which is
full of vitality and imagination. Dulcie lias a fine
taste, in parts too fine, perhaps, for descriptive writ-
ing. The opening chapter, where the worhen slaves
fall victims to furious mal-de-mer, is almost nausea-
ting in its realism. Though Bible incidents are
touched, they hardly intrude, and in no way dimin-
ish the interest of the reader in the sensuous scenes
in which the author is so expert. Cassandra is a
real figure, but Evan is only a character. “The
Street of the Gazelle” is as good as “Revelation,”
and this writer has it in her to do something better
and bigger than either.
Mary Lee, by C. L. Dennis. This is a really
extraordinary novel, and if Mr. Dennis continues as
he has begun lie should achieve fame. Few novels
are justified of their titles. This one most dis-
tinctly is. It is a narrative of personal religion, a
narrative that is haunting and tragic and yet sub-
lime. Mary Lee was a child, brought up in the
narrow faith and physical cruelty of the Plymouth
Brethren in the middle of the Last century. Yet
through it all, she finds in every hardship, in every
ferocity, the will of God, and in the end comes out
triumphant. Mr. Dennis has challenged Dickens
with his descriptions of Aunt Jael and Uncle Simeon,
but Mary Lee, in her egoistic exposure of her mind,
rivals the frankest of modern autobiographies. The
author has shown courage in writing what is, besides
a novel, an historical document of real value.
Jennifer, J., by Ethel Turner (Ward, Lock and
Co.). A book in which the author turns back towards
her earlier stories, with happy effect. It deals
with a family of young Australians, the children
of the editor of a city daily, all of them, except
one, with ink in their veins. r fhe eldest girl edits
a ’Varsity magazine, another her school paper, a
boy is sporting editor of his college sheet, and the
two youngest jointly bring out a fearsome monthly,
“Tho'Pea Nut —Tho Organ of Reform,” printed in purple
on pink paper. The odd-man-out in this literary
welter is the third daughter, “Jennifer—Scaramouch
—Mingo, a mere harum-scarum.” But there’s a God-
given streak of practicalness beneath this youngster’s
shock of bobbed hair, and when the mother—a
daughter of an Oxford professor—conceives the weird
idea of going back to complete her ’Varsity course,
Jennifer keeps a rather wobbly domestic ship on a
fairly even keel. And in the end she turns out to
be something of a black-and-white artist. There
is not much “story” in the book —it is more a
family picture, with the high lights on one member
—but young people will find speculative interest in
Jennifer being charged with financial misappropria-
tion and her subsequent disappearance. Cupid slips
into the pages to fling a noose over the heads of one
sister and a visiting English literary man, and
there are some consciously grown-up touches, in
regard to the mother’s departure and return ; but the
girl reader will easily forgive them. An admirable
and well-timed gift book.

P. S. Cleary, president of the Catholic Federa-
tion, who has sub-edited the Catholic Press (Syd-
ney) for eight years, steps into the late Tighe
Ryan’s shoes as editor; and Dr. Sheehv, of Manly Col-
lege, is dropping his professorial job to take up
the sub-ship. Meanwhile, he will live at the Cath-
edral. Sheehv is an old hand at the game, having
often acted as leader-writer for the Press under
Ryan.
Another unsolicited testimonial'to Billjim's power
of expressing himself—from the new Kiplingesque
novel, “The Truth About Yignolles,’' by Albert Kinross.
The narrator is a keen English officer, who, being
left out of the desert-and-Palestine campaign as too
old, lias disguised himself as an Egyptian and gone
into it as a camel-driver. “The Londoners and the
Irish came along and said all sorts of rude things
to us poor devils plodding in the sand; but I’ll lay
we said ruder. And Anzacs and Aussies on horse-
back. We couldn’t match what they said; big-
hearted chaps, though.”
“Ex-Englishman”: James Joyce’s “Ulysses” has set
the critics raging furiously, one way or the other.
Arnold Bennett credits it with “wit, a prodigious
humor; the best portions of it are superb.” The
other end of the scale is reached by Clement Shorter:
“inartistic, incoherent, unquotably nasty; a book
that one would have thought could only emanate
from a criminal lunatic asylum.” But perhaps the
best idea of the book can be gleaned from the facts
that it had to be published in France, sold at £3,
and is now fetching three times that price.
“Wilfrido”: The manager of a certain M.L. book-
store has the laugh on the local Police Commissioner.
It happened this way. The Police Department de-
cided that Brieux’s “Damaged Goods” was an objec-
tionable work. One firm, continuing to display it,
the Commissioner called on the management. The
result was a somewhat heated argument, and the
Commissioner was presently parading his impartiality.
“I don’t want to block sales of reputable French
literature,” he protested. “I have a daughter who reads
French in the original, and I often buy her some-
thing- suitable; I’ll take her home something no-.v
if you have anything I should consider unexcep-
tionable.” The bookseller named several works, but
his customer seemed doubtful until the “Memoirs
of Casanova” were mentioned. “Memoirs,” said the
Commissioner; “just the thing!”—and he walked
out of the shop with six volumes of Casanova under
his arm.
“M.D.”: Book-publishing, notwithstanding bad
times and the high price of production, shows no
signs of a decline in London, but, on the contrary,
appears to be booming with all its ante-war fervor,
and Australia is well to the fore on the published
and forthcoming lists. The deeds of the heroic
airman, 11. G. Hawker, have been related by Mrs.
Muriel Hawker, the volume being published by
Messrs. Hutchinson at 18s., and Messrs. Black have
just published “The Making of Australia,” a brief
history of the origin and development of the British
Dominions in the South Seas, by Thomas Dunbabin,
of Sydney Sun. Two works by Australians are ear-
marked for appearance during the autumn season, one
being “The Story of a Lion Hunt,” with some of
the hunter’s military adventures during the war.
Written by Arnold Weinholt, M.H.R., D. 5.0., M.C..
it is to be published by Messrs. Melrose, and the
other, “Wanderings in the Queensland Bush,” by
Miss W. L. Puxlev, Messrs. Allen and Unwin have
in hand. I am expecting to sec shortly in the lists
in London a volume of essays by Dr. MacLaurin, of
Sydney.

City comforts ’way outback.
THERE was a time when the country-dweller
had to forego most of the comforts and
conveniences that the city provided. How
different to-day! By means of Western Electric
Power and Light that dweller in the wide, open
spaces, miles from any town, can command all
those conveniences and compensations that make
city life so attractive.
Clean, clear, odorless electric light—in any
place—unaffected by wind or rain, is one boon.
Electric Power is another. Here, under ready
and instant control, you have current that over-
comes the drudgery of household work in a
moment. It makes possible the use of a dish-
washing machine, clothes-washer, electric-iron,
electric fans, vacuum cleaner, electric sewing
machine, and many other wonderful appliances.
NGINE Power is the third service— 3i h.p.,
ample for operating the pump, chaffcutter,
sawbench, etc. Self-denial is every man’s
privilege. He can deny himself all these advan-
tages and comforts, and go on in the old toil-
some, comfortless way. But should he deny
them to his womenfolk?
WESTERN ELECTRIC POWER AND LIGHT
lives up to every claim for it, because it is big and
strong, with a Battery Capacity of 288 Ampere
Hours, twice the size of most other batteries with
lighting plants. Write to-day to nearest of the follow-
ing addresses for 20-page Illustrated Book (post free).

The Dream Ship.
Ship of my dreams, put out to sea.
The white of the moon is calling to me
From the heart of the ancient mystery.
I shall sail by the rocks where the Sirens
call, . .' , , ,
And their songs will come m the lapse and
fall . , „
Of the wind that holds my heart in thrall.
And I shall answer with songs I keep
Deep in my soul where the long thoughts
sleep—
“ Come to me, come to me out on the deep!
“You that have lured the sbipmen bold
To the fearful death in your waters cold.
Your arms are white and your hair is gold,
“But I shall not come though you sing ail
night. ... .
Swim out, swim out in the clear moonlight
That I may kiss you and hold you tight!”
A.nd one shall come. I shall see her far.
Her face like a flower and her breast like
a star.
Oh, the night shall wonder that such things
are!
Laughing the moonlit waters through,
I shall watch her float like a dream come
true —
Heart of my heart, is it you, is it you?
Ship of my dreams, we shall surely go.
By a thousand chartless seas we know,
Wherever God has a wind to blow.
For the white of the moon shall be sweet on
her hair;
And beyond shall be thoughts and thoughts
to shtirc
Heart of my heart, let us dare, let us dare !

Whose names have quivered in the mouths
of men,
Or those old scholars, burdened deep with,
lore,
Who wrangled on the “how” and “why”
and “when”?
Where are those artists who have wrought
with care
The passing vision of a golden hour.
Some imaged beauty once surpassing fair,
And sweet to see —but now surpassing
sour?
Strewn in a little dust upon the street
Their dead forms lie and irritate our eyes,
And, when our teeth grate, we with quick
surmise
Wonder of whom we bite the dead heart-
beats ;
While, for his marble tomb, some un-
known’s death
Fills in the mouths of men a little breath.

Why is the way I go enwreathed with thorn
That wounds my naked feetV
That when you wander soft through Eden
grass
Your soul may find it sweet.
Why does the dark come with a giant’s
stride
And fill me with affright?
'That you with outstretched hands and parted
lips
May greet the eastward light.
Why does the cold rain fall like constant
tears
Shed by an unstanched eye?
That you may see all sorrow pass like clouds
From the deep, sapphire sky.
Whv does this flesh and blood that clothes me
seem
A burden and a goad?
That you may know the lightness and stceet
ease
Of those who walk death's road.
Why do I thirst and burn, nor ever know
A sated heart, and rest?
Because the Dream of all the ages wants
In some far, rose-red west.

Orange Blossoms.
The trees are wreathed with orange bloom,
Like snow upon the branches,
And through the soft and leafy gloom
A merry sunbeam glances,
And gilds my sweetheart’s golden hair,
With quick and cunning lances.
She dreams upon the rustic seat,
Soft hands lie clasped together,
And on the grass her pretty feet
Rest, shod in russet leather,
And all her form is sweet with Spring,
And Spring’s the fairest weather.
The fragrant wind the blossom shakes
And sets it free, and whitely
It stirs and falls in scented flakes
To settle round us lightly—
Sweet bridal flowers—on pensive hands
And soft hair shining brightly.
I would I knew the merry thought
That made the red lips quiver,
I would I knew the fear that wrought
The little sigh and shiver.
Now orange blossom brims the trees —
Of such a wreath I’d give her.

If you have much figuring to do in your business,
you are undoubtedly acquainted with the Burroughs
Adding Machines and you probably know something
about Burroughs Bookkeeping Machines.
But do you know that there is another type of
Burroughs figuring machine especially designed for
extremely rapid figuring, where a printed list of items is
not necessary —for that big figure job in every business
where all that is wanted is the answer?
With a .Burroughs Calculator any clerk can work
out figure problems faster than the best trained special-
ist can do them by mental calculation. For example,
to figure that well-known discount, less 80-30-15-2, in-
volves eight separate mathematical problems which have
to be solved whether you put down the figures on paper
or carry them in your head. With the Burroughs Cal-
culator it is only necessary to know the decimal equiva-
lent of the discount to be taken, and by a simple
mechanical operation the answer appears on the dials
of the machine.
The Burroughs Calculator
V
This handy little machine, easy to learn, easy to
operate, goes straight to the answer; extending and check-
ing invoices and freight bills; gathering cost, selling price
or profit totals; totaling weights and quantities; proving
ledger postings and trial balances; extending and adding
stock-taking figures, and analyzing production records.
Ask us to show you the Calculator. It will give
you a new conception of the speed and accuracy with
which all sorts of routine figuring can be done.
A demonstration will put
you under no obligation and
you may find the Calculator
just the machine you need
to take care of the calculat-
ing work in your office

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1922.
THE QUESTION OF THE HOUR.
The following remarkable allegations were
reported in the press some time back, and,
so far, there have been no contradictions:—
Captain Fitzgerald, who is opposing Mr. Marks
tor Wentworth (N.S.W.), said that the first over-
tures, as regards the handing over of the £25,000
presentation to Mr. Hughes, were made at the Fed-
eral conference of the R.5.5.1.L., held in Hobart in
1018. Congress was told by the president, Senator
Bolton, that he could obtain £lOO from the Fed-
eral Government and the recognition of the League
as the only body through which soldiers could
approach the Government. At that time the New
South Wales branch was under an obligation to the
Government. “In 1920,” said the candidate, “I was
a member of the State Council of the League, and
one evening at a meeting the secretary gave the
information that he had been approached in confi-
dence and asked to try and prevail on the executive
to make the presentation, said to have been collected
by citizens generally, in the name of the returned
soldiers.” The secretary, continued Captain Fitz-
gerald, was told that if he succeeded in getting
the League to make the presentation, it would be
worth £lOO to him. The League turned the pro-
position down. It wanted to know the source of the
gift, and decided to take no action until the names
of the subscribers were known. Eventually the
£25,000 was duly presented, and the formal hand-
ing over of the cheque was done by a member of che
League executive —General Herring. The Press at
that time so camouflaged the whole business as to
make it appear that the presentation came from the
Returned Soldiers’ League.
As neither Senator Bolton nor anyone else
has denied that these proposals were made to
the R. S. League, it may fairly be assumed
that the Senator made them ; and that, even
if he was not authorised to do so by Mr.
Hughes, yet he concluded that, if successful,
his action would help the Hughes cause.
We may take it that his train of thought
was along these lines:—
This £25,000 gift is only a justifiable transaction
on the assumption that it was a tribute for services
rendered to the whole nation. The Prime Minister
cannot afford the shadow of a suspicion that inter-
ested parties were amongst the contributors —or, any-
how, amongst the ultra-generous ones, if there were
any. What is the most truly national body that
Australia has evolved to date? Obviously the
A.1.F., which included all political parties, religious
creeds, races and classes. If any reasonably large
proportion of ex-soldiers could be shown to have pro-
vided the £25,000, that would put the payment as
far above reproach almost as, say, Admiral Jelli-
coe's Parliamentary vote for his war-services is above
reproach.
It was not necessary, in order to legiti-
matise the gift, for ex-members of the A.I.F.
to have subscribed all, or most, of the money.
The business would have taken on a bona jidc
character if the subscribers had been all
women, or all farmers, or all men between
-10 and 50 years of age. There was only one
vital requirement—numerousness, involving
a lack of expectation on the part of the con-
tributors of any reward in this world,
barring, of course, that comfort which an
eased political conscience provides. The un-
desirability of a Prime Minister accepting
large money gifts on more restricted lines is
evident at any time. When that Prime
Minister happens to be what he calls
“master in His own house”-—in other words
when he is surrounded by a notoriously
weak, not to say futile, Ministry—and when
his hands are further strengthened by a
considerable residue of war-time legislation,
the acceptance of a money gift at the hands
of a few becomes a temptation which might
try the virtue of a Diogenes. One of the
scandals which helped to accomplish the
downfall of Lloyd Georgism was the revela-
tion that the Government had trafficked on
a large scale in titles. According to public
men as widely divergent in then 1 political
opinion as J. R. Clynes, the Laborite, and
the Duke of Northumberland, who is a high
Tory, it was a dangerous thing that pro-
fiteers should have been allowed to acquire
baronetcies and peerages by paying large
sums to the party of Mr. Lloyd George—
not to Mr. Lloyd George ; only to his party.
The suggestion was that these men, having
bought the party once, might do it again;
that having got rank for cash they would
probably set out to get the cash back on the
same lines in the form of concessions.
None of the critics of the Lloyd George
Administration voiced any objection to the
old-established principle that subscriptions
may be given to party funds. What they
feared were isolated subscriptions running
into thousands of pounds sterling, subscrip-
tions so vast that they might be expected
to put the Government of the country under
the thumbs of the subscribers. But if they tcok
exception to these amounts being handed to
the party treasurer and duly accounted for
with the rest of the party funds, what would
have been their emotions had they learned
that the price of an earldom had been handed
to the Prime Minister for his own private
use with no conditions attached? Undoubt-
edly they would have argued that these pri-
vate donors expected to be privately reim-
bursed. And human nature being the same
here as elsewhere, that inevitably is what
is being said of Mr. Hughes by those who
suspect that his £25,000 came from a rela-
tively limited lot of bank accounts. Sup-
pose, for the sake of argument, that some
of the chief subscribers were capitalists
interested in inter-imperial or inter-State
industries —industries, that is, capable of
being made or marred at the Federal Gov-
ernment’s pleasure—how could Mr. Hughes
turn an impartial eye on their representa-
tions when they came to him for help, as
some of them inevitably would if they had
helped him? He could not do it without
at the same time handing back the cash, un-
less he wanted to be accused of confidence
trickery. For, however much we may regret
it, this is not a world in which thousands
of pounds sterling are heaped by plutocrats
on ex-Laborites out of sheer admiration for
the latter’s beautiful eyes.
**-*<#•
And so we get back to what is really the
most urgent political question of the day in
the view of those who stand for purity in
public life, viz., “Who paid Mr. Hughes his
£25,000?” The essence of the thing, as Sena-
tor Bolton and the rest of the Nationalists
who have tried to saddle the A.I.F. with the
responsibility clearly understand, is twofold.
The money, or any considerable part of it,
must not have been given (1) by a few
individuals, and more particularly (2) by
any individual whom the Prime Minister,
by virtue of his office and the peculiar way
in which he dominates his Cabinet, is in a
position to assist in a commercial sense. The
principle may be best illustrated by reference
to the practice in vogue on the Bench all
over the Empire. No self-respecting Judge
will sit in any matter involving a company
in which he holds shares; and any company-
director who, during the hearing of a case
in which his concern was Jnvolved, tried to
present a Judge with a ’mere £looo—much
less 25 times that sum—would speedily find
himself in the hands of the police. A Prime
Minister occupies a fiduciary position as
regards the public in exactly the same way
as a Judge does. Both carry powers of finan-
cial life and death. The only difference
in this sense between (say) Prime Minister
Hughes and Chief Justice Adrian Knox, is
that the former has 10 times, a hundred
times, more power to help a friend to great
wealth, if he happens to be inclined that
way. The Bulletin does not assert that Mr.
Hughes’s £25,000 has been paid chiefly
by two or three capitalists whose
financial ventures stand to be bene-
fited by the Czar-like powers which he
wields. But what it does say is that, at
present, the thing looks fishy; and the well-
meant efforts of liis friends, such as Senator
Bolton,' show that they know it. While
this cloud hangs over the Prime Minister
it is futile of him to noint to his war ser-
vices as a reason why he should be returned
to power. Even the fact that he had saved
the country from Prussianism before 1918
would not justify him in handing it over to
capitalism after that date. if his hands
are clean in the matter, he can prove it, and
by so doing confound his critics and, almost
certainly, win the coming election for
Nationalism from end to end of Australia.
All he need do is to hand the names of those
who gave him his £25,000 to the press. If,
he is unable to do it there should be no place
for him in the public life of any British
community.
SETTLING ACCOUNTS WITH
MILLEN.
One of the endearing features of National-
ism is a rooted belief that all the people
can be bluffed all the time. This accounts
for the fact that Edward Davis Millen
is standing for re-election as a N. S. Wales
Senator, instead of retiring from public life
and expiating his disastrous administrative
record in a cave or a hollow log. As Min-
ister of Repatriation, Millen is responsible
for the appalling muddle of the war-service
homes. Not responsible altogether, since he
can’t be blamed for what happened while
he was away at one of the post-war confer-
ences in Europe; but he it was who set up
the egregious Homes Commission, who broke"
off negotiations with the efficient State build-
ing organisations, and who made the foolish
arrangement with the Commonwealth Bank.
In short, Millen was the author of the in-
effably stupid and tragically wasteful system
which collapsed so inevitably last year.
But, true to the tenets of Nationalism, this
culpable and incapable administrator expresses
no regrets. Four years ago, when introduc-
ing the War Service Homes Bill, lie talked
glibly of building 25,000 houses for
-112,500,000. Last week, in a disingenuous
attempt to put the best face on a bad busi-
ness, he gave the following statement to the
Nationalist press:—
The actual average cost of the war-service homes
provided for the ex-soldiers and their dependants is
a-678. There appears to be some misapprehension
as to the actual cost of the houses. The amount
of approximately £750, which has been generally
given, is obtained by dividing the total amount ex-
pended by the War Service Homes Commission
(about £15,000,000) by the number of homes pro-
vided (approximately 20,000). This, however, is
not the cost of the home to the occupant, as the
total expenses incurred by the Commissioner include
amounts paid for timber areas and for other assets
now on hand. Such amounts are not in any sense
a charge upon the homes provided for the soldiers.
From which it might be inferred that the
Government had built 20,000 houses for an
average cost of £O7B. As a matter of fact,
nearly two-thirds of the war-service homes
were bought ready-made because the build-
ing programme had hopelessly broken down.
* * * *
“This,” says the Public Accounts Com-
mittee drily, “was a definite departure from
the declared policy of the Commission, but
the figures indicate that considerably less
was required to buy a house than to build
one.” In other words, 11,117 houses were
purchased and 1061 mortgages discharged
for a total outlay (up to June 30) of
£7,430,000, whereas £7,434,000 was expended
in building 6278 new dwellings, and com-
pleting 100 which had been partly erected at
the occupants’ expense. Administrative
charges mopped up an additional £447,053.
Owing to the chaotic methods of Millen’s
myrmidons, methods which the Public
Accounts Committee describes as “bad
administration, defective supervision and
unreliable costing records,” the average out-
lay on those 6278 structures is known neither
to Millen nor anyone else. A “responsible
witness” told the Accounts Committee that
“he would not swear to the cost of a single
home.” The Committee itself emphasises
that a large proportion of the Diggers for
whom houses were erected (a majority of
those in Victoria) can get no statement
from Millen’s department of the amounts
they will ultimately be called upon to pay.
In the course of its investigations, however,
it learned enough to satisfy it that “nearly
all” the shacks run up by the Commission
cost more than the £BOO specified in the Act,
and that in many cases, particularly in N. S.
Wales, the excess ranged between £2OO and
£4OO. while in Queensland it was so enormous
that “many of the houses built in that State
remain unoccupied.” So much for the mis-
leading assertion that “the actual average
cost” was £678.
* a *• *
That “the total expenses of the Commis-
sioner include amounts paid for timber areas
and for other assets now on hand” is only too
true. A sum of £531,000 was light-heartedly
sunk in a Queensland sawmill, which has
been shut down for 18 months. Huge stocks
of timber and other building materials,
bought with the same wild contempt for ex-
pense, accumulated in other States. These
and other assets, such as spacious areas ot
swamp and sand, are for sale cheap, but
buyers are few and reluctant, and the cost
of realisation (for disposal boards have had
to be appointed) is heavy. Since the Com-
mission retired from the building trade
£49,633, according to the Auditor-General’s
list, has been paid as compensation for can-
celled contracts, and huge claims (one for
£192,000, and another, which is reported to
have succeeded, for £60,000 or £70,000) are
outstanding. A modest estimate of the losses
on the lovely transactions in land, sawmills,
joinery, tiles, chimney-pots, lime, cement,
plaster of paris and so forth is a million
sterling, and the Lord knows how many
millions were flung away in other directions.
Vain is the pretence that these besotted
methods of doing business will cost
the Digger nothing. Impudent is the closing
paragraph of the Minister’s communication
to the obsequious organs of Nationalism
I hope this plain statement of the facts will dis-
pose of the reckless charges which have been le-
cently made, either that the homes have cost an
excessive amount, or that the soldiers have been
charged with unnecessary amounts which should not
properly be debited to them.
Millen hasn’t given a plain statement of
the facts. He isn’t game. His reference to
“reckless charges” is a reflection on the
Public Accounts Committee, of which
Fowler, a Nationalist M.H.R., is chairman,
stud Buzacott and Bolton, two Nationalist
Senators, are members, the others being West
(Labor), Prowse (C.P.) and Fleming
(C.P.). Some of the Committee’s remarks
as to the excessive cost of houses, in Mil-
len’s State have been mentioned.
On the point of inordinate charges one plain
tale from one of its progress reports will
put Millen down :
It is undoubtedly a fact that some of the houses
erected under the day-labor system have been charged
to the occupants at considerably more than their
worth. As, in the main, the extra cost in these
instances is admittedly due to bad administration
and defective supervision, it is hot right that the
soldier should have to pay for these.
There is a great deal more about “chaotic
costing, defective checking of material, very
bad management, foolish instructions, hap-
hazard purchases and incomprehensible deal-
ings,” but sufficient has been quoted to show
what kind of administrator Millen is. He
was entrusted with the job of housing the
Diggers and fell down on it. His regime
has been marked by riotous expenditure and
ruinous results. Four years after the war,
as a friendly tribunal points out, “only a
small percentage of the men and women for
whom the scheme was intended,” and with
whom the “Nationalist” Government made a
solemn compact on the nation’s behalf, “have
obtained their homes”: the great majority
are “disheartened and disgusted.” No amount
of special pleading can dispose of these facts,
and if the doctrine of ministerial responsi-
bility hasn’t become a mere sham, the axe of
retributive justice should fall on the guilty
Government at the general election. And
on Millen first of all.
SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE GREAT
SHRIEKTARIAN ISSUE.
Dear Bulletin, —The shriektarian, sec-
tarian, insectarian or bacteriological issue
already promises to play a leading part in
the coining Federal election, so a few general
remarks on the subject may not be out of
place. I claim to be qualified to speak, being
of no sect whatever myself. The one to which
I nominally belong, but wholly fail to con-
form to, died out 1500 years ago, being too
good to live. If I, with my nominal ad-
hesion, had been around then it would have
died just the same. Its whole creed went
into this little bundle of words uttered by
the Master :—•
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all tbv
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength,
and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself.
At least an argumentative solicitor recited it
to Him, and lie said it contained the whole
recipe for salvation, without any creeds or
ceremonies or robes or titles whatsoever. And
what an injunction it is, to be sure, for a
normal man to have to try and obey! Take
my case. My immediate neighbor to north
and east is the municipal council, which
owns, and is, therefore, legally and
morally responsible for, the blasphemy-
inducing road along which my house-
hold supplies are precariously carted.
The one on the west seems to be Arthur
Rickard, Limited, who has the allotment for
sale. On the south is the caretaker of an
empty house belonging to a Jew. Underneath,
the landlord is reputed to be a brownish,
brimstonish, hairy person with horns,
whose estate joins on to mine at the middle
of the earth. I don’t know his right name,
but several of his aliases, mostly unspellable,
were taught to me in my defenceless youth. As
regards the inhabitants of the upward regions
my ignorance is profound. My nearest sur-
face companion is a church which dislikes me,
and says with emphasis that I will be
damned for not belonging and contributing
to it, it being the only true Church, and the
one that stands no nonsense and does all
the damning.
Some early shorthandists evidently Pit-
maned the sayings, or some of the
sayings, of the Master, and the work
does not seem to have been all lost.
When the four third parties who com-
piled the gospels from notes, legends
and ancient hearsay got to work, these
original records were utilised. They include
such gems as the Sermon on the Mount, and
especially the Lord’s Prayer. They are
based on the Hebrew ideal of one Deity:
they suit one respectable sect as well as
another, so that they give no one creed a
start over the next one, and they are not
the slightest use for collections, general
elections, propaganda, persecution, worldly
promotion, riot, denunciation, conspiracy,
Binn Feinism, Nationalism, excommunication
or any other amenities of the sort. Where-
fore parties who are still at large, in a shriek-
tarian manner of speaking, dropped the hard
road to better things in a heap, and put into
the mouth of the Master this perfectly new,
and wholly different, saying:—
He that believeth and is baptised shall be Saved,
but he that believeth not shall be damned.
Baptism is easy, being only one wash the
more in a lifetime ; and, being usually inflicted
by compulsion on an irresponsible and help-
less. infant, it carries no responsibilities.
Belief is the commonest substance on earth.
It makes Mormons, Methodists, Mugglo-
touians and Mohammedans with equal
facility : also priests and punters, parsons and
believers in Esoteric Jumboism. There being
no test prescribed— apart from the solitary
extra wash —save belief, it follows that where
there are a hundred beliefs the best a con-
scientious fanatic or sectary can do is to
be one good Christian and 99 very bad here-
tics—at least the unbiased spectator
imagines so. The only way the strenuous
sectary can get a scrap of comfort out of
the situation is by holding tenaciously to the
idea that his belief is the real and specified
article, and that the other 99 are damned.
From thinking it he gets to mentioning it,
and then arise the unpleasantness, and the
great shriekterian, sectarian, insectarian or
bacteriological issue which, unless rumor
lies and custom is departed from, is going
to whoop things up once more on Federal
election day. The trouble is that the purely
believing species of believer, as he needs no
special distinguishing qualities save his
deafening say-so, is hard to disprove. The
sort of believer whom the Master defined
to the lawyer could be positively identified
a mile off.
Tennyson, who was something of an ass
as well as a poet, told his Clara Yere de
Vere that “kind hearts are more than coro-
nets,” which is true, and “simple faith than
Norman blood,” which was a fool’s remark.
The Norman, being in the main a robust,
hard-headed agricultural person, w r ith a stern
grip on the bawbees, isn’t a bad stock to
intermarry with. On the other hand, simple
faith has a retreating chin and a forehead like
the unlettered and unprogressive hen, and is


the stuff out of which Pastor Down:, the
sham Elijah with the Purple Wm g s, got
the money to build his city of Zion. Every
writer of mining prospectuses relies on
simple faith for his bread and butter, and
m?ry bookmaker looks to it to provide him
is my neighbor in com-
mon with the municipal council and the care-
taker and Arthur Pickard and Co. (Lim-
ited), and the nameless Afghan underground,
and which is supposed to love me like itself,
though that is a lot to expect, will be found
fighting in the front rank when the bacterio-
logical issue comes up on election day. It
is always there, because it is more certain
than any other of the impregnability of its
spiritual position. It has a text all to itself
in Holy Writ:— .
Thou .art Peter, and upon this rock I will build
My Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail
against it. And I will give unto thee the keys
of the kingdom of Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt
bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven, and whatso-
ever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
Heaven.
There are gaps to be filled in, of course, as
in many another claimant’s pedigree. No
particular church is specified, so possibly
it was just the Church in general—the one
which is so hard to locate —that loves its
neighbor as itself. Three of the four Gos-
pel-writers either never heard of the stupen-
dous gift, or regarded the saying as an
obscure parable of minor importance. There
is a great lack of evidence that Peter founded
any distinctive church. At least, when
Paul went to Rome, as Scripturally re-
corded, allegedly in the 22nd year of Peter’s
triumphant reign as Pope, it isn’t even hinted
that he found Peter there. And when he
wrote his one little letter to Rome (which
was all the Western Church got from him,
though he wrote eight to the congregations at
the Greek end of the empire), he didn’t ad-
dress himself either to a dominant church;
or a dominant Pontiff. It isn’t suggested
that the donation to Peter, who fades out of
the New Testament narrative rather early,
was transmissible to sons, daughters, heirs-
at-law, trustees, assignees, creditors or any
other parties whatsoever. It doesn’t appear
to include the keys of hell, purgatory or
limbo, or even the key of the street. And
there is a lack of information as to the
difference between being “loose” and “bound.”
and the superior desirability of either condi-
tion.
Still, among the neighbors whom I am
supposed to love equally with myself, and
whom I must love equally on December 16
next if my bit of the election is to be run in
a Christian spirit, I like this church most,
for its intentions are good. I recognise that,
whatever I may think of its methods and
details. I draw no invidious distinctions
between the property agency and the muni-
cipal council. But the one I wholly refuse
to love is the Afghan underground. My
share of the shriektarian, sectarian, insec-
tarian or bacteriological issue consists in
objecting to him utterly.—Yours faithfully,
J.E.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Kaiserism in Politics.
At the end of last week W. M. Hughes
arrived in the constituency which Archdale
Parkhill was ordered by York-street to
hand over to him, and started to fight for
his life. If a vote were taken in North
Sydney at this moment Hughes would pro-
bably go down. His opponent is nearly
everything that a candidate should be.
However,, the election will not hinge on
questions either of personal character or
political policy. Hughes will see to that.
And on the side-issues which Nationalism has
already begun to raise, Fiddington should
be defeated. The strength of tricksters hke
Hughes is that they are prepared to state
any proposition, however idiotic, provided
it looks like getting votes; while the elec-
tors, who are mostly credulous, and never
more gullible than during an election, are
inclined to favor the demagogue who appeals
to their prejudices in preference to the
genuine character who appeals to their rea-
son. Thus, the first thing Mr. Hughes did
the other night was to argue that in voting
for Piddington an elector of North Sydney
would be voting Labor —Labor, according to
this renegade Laborite, being everything that
he used to protest against Joseph Cook
calling it in pre-war days. “Mr. Pidding-
ton,” he sneered, “says he is an ‘lndepen-
dent.’ But unless a man has 38 at his back
in the House he can do nothing. He must
either join the Nationalist sheep or the
Labor goats.” This cynical notion that a
Parliamentarian has to be the slave of. a
Caucus boss in order to vindicate his prin-
ciples, or serve his constituents or his coun-
try, is characteristic of one who was reared
in the Czar-like atmosphere of modern
unionism, and who has introduced the Prus-
sian discipline of the Trades Hall to the
Capitalistic party with which he is now
associated. But as a matter of widely-
known fact, the history of Parliamentary
Government is stiff with instances of great
reforms which were effected by Indepen-
dents. The Bulletin has not much use
for Mr. Piddington’s child-endowment
scheme on the practical side, but as an
aspiration it is unassailable. He says, in
effect, that thousands of children are
shackled by poverty, and that the National
Legislature should interfere in the matter;
that, just as the Federal Parliament has
instituted old age pensions, so it should
introduce a form of infant pensions. At
the end of the 18th century, William Wil-
berfokce, a rich man of fashion, but one who
also happened to be a visionary and ahead
of his time, was returned to the of
Commons for Cambridge. Pitt was Wil-
berforce’s personal friend as well as his
party leader. A dreadful thing, from the
standpoint of Pitt and the party, presently
happened to Wilberforce. He became a
Christian —not a mere church-going Chris-
tian, but a genuine one. Pitt made a
desperate effort to stop the rot, save the
straying sheep. But Wilberforce was obdu-
rate. ? ‘The truth about Pitt is,” he told
one of his friends, “that he is so absorbed
in politics that he has never thought about
religion”—a reflection which might, with
equal justice, be applied to a Prime Minister
of our day. Wilberforce, as Mr. Hughes
would put it, joined the goats. He began
his crusade for the abolition of slavery. The
time was unfavorable. The French Revolu-
tion was at hand, and a dread of change
was in the air. Yet he put the reform be-
fore the people of England, and won their
acceptance of it from Parliament, as surely
as John Wilkes imposed the principle of
the freedom of the press on the nation from
the same place and against equally formid-
able odds. Whether Mr. Piddington s
humanitarian schemes are right or wrong,
practicable or otherwise, is a question on
which honest men may differ. But. for
Hughes to say that in order to effectuate
them Piddington must sell his independ-
ence, either to York-street or Macdonell
House, that an M.P. to be worth his salary
must sacrifice his soul, is an impudent dis-
tortion of truths which are familiar to
most school children.
The Church and the Unemployed.
Deak Bulletin,— “Sky Pilot” expresses
surprise (8.16/11/’22) at the inability of the
various church conferences, specially the last
visited, the Congregational Union, to find a
sympathetic and helpful platform on which to
meet the deputation of the unemployed. The
only relation the Church can sustain to the
unemployed is of an eleemosynary character.
This the unemployed recognise by singling
out the parson in street, home and church.
A London minister, travelling on a health
tour, had to appear without clerical collar
on the second day in Sydney to get along at
all! Appeals from unemployed were so fre-
quent that they went beyond his means
and time. The clergy do not object to
practise the charity they preach, but “Sky
Pilot” asks more, and he asks the impos-
sible. How can the Church father the mad-
ness of the industrials, which is largely the
cause of unemployment? Take the strike
for 44 hours. Except for specially un-
healthy callings, it was the very worst time
to ask for shorter hours, when, to repair
the loss of war, it was necessary for all to
work as well and as long as possible. Then
take the present refusal in the iron trade to
work overtime. It is childish. The men know
that employers do not ask for overtime, or
pay the extra wages for overtime, for fun.
One would think that it was a species of
tyranny, something the employer was doing of
malice prepense, instead of being an absolute
necessity and a condition of getting the work
at all! A great proportion of the engineer-
ing in Svdney is repair -work. A factory’s or
a ship’s machinery breaks down. It is
sent for repair. Time is of the essence of
the contract, and the men know that, by
refusing to work overtime, they are prevent-
ing the employer obtaining contracts and
sending jobs to other ports. The clergy know
this. Their work lies amongst the indus-
trial classes, and they see scores of cases
where the union officials metaphorically
take the employer by the throat, and, at
the worst time for him and with fatal
results to industry, wring concessions from
him. “Go slow,” “irritant strikes” and
other forms of sabotage common in the
trades and in mining are absolutely opposed
to Christian principles. They despoil
struggling firms, they ruin our trade, and,
indeed, strike heaviest blows at labor itself;
and yet “Sky Pilot” seems to expect that
the churches should stand for it. No! We
will give what help we can, for often the
innocent individual suffers for the union’s
aggregate sin; but it is too much for us to
be asked “to suffer fools gladly.” It is
really the worst humbug for these deputa-
tions of unemployed to go whining from one
church conference to another. They have
abandoned the churches and the. principles
of plain, commonsense Christianity. They
get their economic gospel from Russia and
subscribe money to send their leaders there
to receive their lessons, but when they miss
a meal or two they look out for a church
synod or union meeting or a parson to put
their case to. The proper place for these
deputations to go is neither to the Pre-
mier’s office, the Legislative Assembly nor
the church conferences. Let them go to the
Trades Hall and have a really heart-to-heart
talk with the well-paid union leaders who
•‘pull them out” and “put them in,” and
generally treat them as a lot of pawns in
the game of a stupid and selfish unionism
which has almost immobilised labor by its
false principles and wrong tactics. If
•‘Sky Pilot” will come down from the
clouds he will see that the Church and the
unemployed talk neither the same moral nor
economic language. Rev. Absalom Deans,
8.A., was entirely right: the Church can
have no dealings with these men whilst they
continue their disruptive folly and practise
methods which are alien to the principles of
the most elementary fair play and common
sense. —Yours, etc., James Green.

The Public for the Public Servants.
The Balaclava (Vic.) speech in which
Watt said good-bye (and good riddance) to
Nationalism contained some arresting fig-
ures about the swelling importance of the
public servant, who threatens to become the
public’s master. “In 1900,” said the man
who wants to be known as an Independent
Liberal, “there were 89,831 Australians in
Government employment. To-day the num-
ber is 248,976.” That refers only to persons
in permanent billets. It doesn’t include the
battalions of so-called temporary clerks to
be found in city departments, or the legions
of unskilled laborers who move from one
Government loan-job to another. Even so,
the increase is rather startling. Watt is
tormented with doubts as to whether the
community can stand the burden, or is suffi-
ciently armed against the danger of the ser-
vice vote being sold to the highest bidder.
No such considerations worry the Primin-
ister. That statesman believes in surround-
ing himself with multitudes of Government
servants and in earning their gratitude by
well-timed concessions. The only measure
in which he displayed any particular interest
last session was the Superannuation Bill, by
virtue of which the taxpayer will have to
find millions in grants to the Commonwealth
employees over and above their salaries. Be-
fore this piece of legislation was introduced
he announced that it had been “demanded”
by the beneficiaries, and would have to be
passed—as passed it was. And last week
he declared that the Country party had
“damned” itself by opposing the thing.
Handing out pre-election bribes to public ser-
vants is an old game of Labor Governments
and of coalitions dominated by Labor poli-
ticians. Just before the 1920 election the
N. S. Wales four-o’clockers receiving less
than £525 p.a. were granted the right to
have their salaries fixed by the Arbitration
Court instead of, as formerly, by the Phblic
.Service Board, that body being retained to
determine salaries not touched by the Court,
and working conditions. What followed is
interesting to the taxpayer in. a melancholy
way.
The clerical employees (3400 of them) developed
a grievance. After a desultory conference with the
Beard they applied to the Court for an award. The
proceedings lasted five months —-seven, including
vacations—and cost each party thousands of pounds,
hundreds of witnesses being called. In the end the
Court helped to disorganise the Treasurer’s Estimates
by awarding massive increases, which were dated
back 13 months. The Labor Government thought-
fully paid up a few days before the March election.
And, after all, it was found that the award applied
to only 2000 of the 3400 applicants. That meant
that the Board had to fix the salaries of the 1400
not provided for, and review each of the other 2000
cases as well. For the Court simply said that so
much should be paid for a particular class of work,
leaving everything else to the Board.
The professional officers, 1200 in number, were
the next to become dissatisfied. After the familiar
negotiations with the Board, they took their case to
the Court, and spent a small fortune in costs. At
the end of five months the Court dealt with 600 of
them, and said that the Board was quite capable of
attending to the rest.
The general division next applied for an award.
In November, 1921, the proceedings began and they
are still dragging on, with no conclusion in sight.
So far the parties have called 300 witnesses; and
seeing that so many persons can be spared for long
periods to instruct a strange Judge as to their
departmental duties, the question arises whether
a lot of them couldn’t be spared altogether. When
the award is delivered —and Heaven knows when
that will be —it will cover only a section of the
general division ; the Board will have to fill up the
gaps as usual. Meantime the expenses are prodigious.
Remark of Justice Cuklewis during one of these
futile cases: “What is the use of putting the coun-
try to the expense of paying two tribunals to do
the same thing?” Apropos, one in every seven of
those whose salaries have been determined under the
new arrangement have appealed to the Board against
the award of the Court.
The Fuller Government has put an end to
this costly tomfoolery. It has restored the
control of the Public Service Board, which
is to have salaries committees to help it.
The discontented will have a right of appeal
to a tribunal composed of two members of
the Board and a District Court Judge. For
this the Government has been savagely de-
nounced both in and out of Parliament. It
has been violently accused of turning dog
on its benefactors, the public servants. They,
it is alleged, put the Government in, and they
will pitch it out at the first opportunity.
There may be nothing in these threats but
gas and gasconade, but they make the tax-
payer very tired. That person has remarked
the shameiess bribery which goes on in respect
of the public service vote. He harbors, a
suspicion that the ferocity of the State in-
come-tax is due in nb sma*ll degree to the
Government departments being grossly over-
manned. Therefore, he is not in the mood
to accept as his political masters those who
are called his servants. If he is forced into
an attitude of defence by the straw-hatted
zealots who believe that the Government'
exists for the Government employee he has
a weapon in reserve. It is called separate
representation.
The Military Valuelessness of the
Rifle Club.
“Rio”:—
When are our N.R.A. enthusiasts going to get down
to earth and realise that most of the work done on the
ranges is, for all practical—meaning active-service —
purposes, useless. In Sydney, last month, the riflemen
set up a terrific outcry because shooting be'- d
600yds. was prohibited. Yet in France indi-
vidual shooting beyond even 400yds. was unknown, and
by far the greater proportion was under 200yds.
There are many reasons why individual shooting
beyond 600yds. is useless, of which the chief are:
(1) It is found impossible even for trained men to
judge distance correctly within an average error
of 20 per cent. (2) It is impossible for the private
soldier to select the proper target—the enemy hav-
ing dummy trenches and guns, troops moving to
draw fire from the real attack, which is camou-
flaged, and other ruses —and so the thing must bo
chosen by a leader with glasses, or signalled from
the air, from an observation-post, or ordered by
lI.Q. (3) To get fire concentrated on a well-
camouflaged object men will often be ordered to
aim at a post, tree or chimney; perhaps using the
wrong range. Here the marksman who shoots to
an inch or two will do no good at all. It is the
rapid and approximately accurate soldier' who may
score. (4) A rifle, after firing a certain number
of rounds, or being cleaned hurriedly a few times,
becomes slightly inaccurate, though not enough to
affect it for ordinary usage or for combined fire.
Precision also suffers by bayonet-fixing; by using
a strange weapon or different makes of ammuni-
tion ; by atmospheric conditions and in many other
ways. A book that might be studied with profit by
every Australian rifleman is “Sniping in France,”
by the late -Major Hesketh-Puitchahd. He was
not a. “regular,” but had been a famous deer-
stalker and big-game shot. In the 16-days’ course
at his “S.O.S.’’ school in France no shooting was
done beyond 400yds. There were only nine actual
firing practices, mostly grouping and snap-shooting
at 100 to 200 yards, with firer or target moving.
Much of the “5.0.5.” school’s shooting was at
targets with two or three seconds’ exposure. The
majority of our clubmen take nearer two minutes.
As to the sniping in France, “Wii,libai,d,” the
famous Hun marksman, who for weeks picked off
several British a day and defied all detection, was
found to be 70vcls. (not 700) away, in a turnip-
field, while the range in “The Cat” episode was
200yds. Here are three extracts from llesketh-
Pritchaicd’s book, which should give those interested
in defence something to ponder over—
The wonderful rapid-fire, which was the glory of
the original 8.E.F., was not sniping, nor was it
beyond a certain degree accurate. Its aim was
to create a beaten zone through which nothing living
could pass, and that business was not best served
by very accurate individual shooting. Rather it
was served by rapid fire under skilled fire control.
Concerning sniping at a German’s head: —
Every good target shot was not successful, for
speed was only less necessary than accuracy, and no
sniper was worth the name who could not get his
shot off in two seconds from sighting his target.
And, finally:—
Sniping is the art of hitting a very small object
straight off, without a sighting shot.
Taking all these facts into consideration, can there
be any doubt that our club shooting, as a serious
preparation for war, is useless, and the money spent
on it is wasted ? To reduce the vote for training by
half-a-million sterling, so that our raw trainees cannot
be given proper musketry instruction, and at. the same
time increase the club vote by nearly £5OOO, as
was done this year, is a scandal. Most of our rifle-
men were crack shots 20 years ago, and have learnt
nothing since. All other countries produce snipers
without a highly-subsidised club system. And
why should not Australia do it ? As a sporting
and social organisation in small country towns
clubs may deserve encouragement, but most ath-
letic sports and games also develop military quali-
ties, and have just as much claim to a subsidy as
target shooting.

Millionaires in the Making.
“Bronte” is explicit:—•
Up till the year 1906 the sugar industry in this
country was almost entirely dependent on Kanaka
labor. In that year Tommy Tanka was sent back to
his coral island, and Queensland proceeded to
demonstrate that sugar could be grown by
white labor. Naturally, the industry attracted
many workers who could not deliver the
goods. I was in the Herbert River district when the
first white gangs were tried out. Many of them
were the products of the slums of southern cities.
The first years of the white-labor experiment were
marked by an abnormal amount of crime and riots.
It took time to separate the straw from the chaff, but
the fact soon became apparent that the white worker
could stand up to the conditions of the sugar in-
dustry when he worked. Indeed, it was soon proved
that he could lose Tommy Tank a at the game— when
he worked. The pitiful part of it was that the white
worker was too ready to obey the dictates of
“organisers” and to strike oi\ the slightest
pretext. Incessant strikes began to give the industry
a “jumpy” feeling, and growers began to lose
confidence. None could say with certainty
when he would get his crop harvested. And sugar
must be harvested at a certain time of the year—
between June and December-.- At this period the
density, i.e., sugar contents, are best, and the cut
cane has a better chance of ratooning or sending up
the young shoots which become the next season’s
crop. Growers were often left with cane on the fields
which should have been harvested. Some had their
crops burned because they would not yield to the
demands of the organiser. In despair, the growers
began to look for some relief, and someone suggested
the importation of Spanish labor. Gangs of Spaniards
were brought out under agreement to growers. They
were, for the greater part, residents of the larger
Spanish cities, and, whilst they could sing grand
An Intolerable Prospect.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Speaking at North Sydney General Rykie said:
“This man, whom we have the honor ot' voting for,
was offered literally the Prime Ministeiship of Eng-
land, but he refused. If North Sydney does not
work and return Mr. Hughes with the honor he
deserves, I shall not be able to hold up my head
for shame, and if William Morris Hughes goes out
1 go out, and Bruce goes out with me.”
Beware, then, citizens of Sydney North,
Whom Piddington assiduously woos,
Before you cast incontinently forth
That suppliant for shelter, Billy Hughes .
His slippery methods and his twisting
views.
His rank apostasies, his boastful claim
To be Sir Oracle —should you refuse
To acquiesce in. Bruce will quit the game,
And Eyrie’s head be bowed in bitter, speech-
less shame.
Think not of Billy only. Think of them
Whose goose you cook by putting on his
pot.
Picture a lily wilting on its stem.
A rose that withers when the wind is hot,
A drunk debarred his matutinal tot,
Or any other type of misery dire.
So with the pair who needs must dread
the lot
Of Hindu widows destined for the hre
That rises from the late lamented’s funeral
pyre.
It would not hang in shame, the General’s
head,
If Dempsey to a pug of color tell,
Or slippered Turks in hordes, by Iyemal led,
Bundled the interfering infidel
Out of the Straits and neutral zone pell-
mell.
He’s made of sterner stuff, as you re aware.
But should Hughes get it in the neck— oh,
H—11! , . t .
Iron in his soul and ashes on Ins hair,
Granville will feature grief and image blank
despair.
Then ponder, dwellers on the northern shore,
Before th’ irrevocable choice you make.
A soldier soul that never quailed before
Will shudder, and a heart of oak may break
If Billy gets the bird, make no mistake!
Should William take the knock, and the wild
mob’s „ . ,
Ungrateful hoofs his rearward regions rake,
Eyrie and Bruce will promptly, choked with
sobs
And torn with shame, abandon their respec-
tive jobs.

T. THE R.
CHRISTMAS NUMBER,
due on December 9, contains Henry
Lawson’s last yarn. He chose it him-
self, a few weeks before his death, as the
one by which he wanted to be repre-
sented in the Christmas issue. There
is a remarkably fine collection of pic-
tures, the frontispiece being an Abo.
idyll by B. E. Minns. Abbott, Bedford,
Dyson and “Kodak” are among the old
favorites who figure in this number, and
some brilliant new men make their first
bow. Altogether it is an astonishing
sixpenn’orth.


opera more or less commendably, and did so, in and
out of season, as cane-harvesters they were duds.
It was at about this stage that Giuseppe began to
come into prominence. He simply gloried in the
work. The tropic day was not long enough for him ;
he loaded his cane by moonlight—in the evening
when the moon was young, and in the morning when
the moon was old. Naturally, he made much money,
'and, as he was not a drinker and there was nothing
to attract him to the southern cities to spend his
cheque during the slack season, he began to invest in
sugar lands. Very soon it became apparent that the
Italians were buying farms in every section of the
northern sugar districts. Giuseppe, after cutting
the cane for a farmer, was found, at the end of the
season, making his employer an offer for the farm.
Whence came the capital ? No one can say exactly
except the Italians themselves. But this much is
certain —they have a system of pooling their funds
which might well be emulated by the British sugar-
workers. While Giuseppe continues every year (o
acquire more and more sugar lands, the British
worker is content to take what is offering in wages
during the season and then revert to the chances of
the labor market. Every year sees the Italian in-
creasing his freehold, and the time is in sight when
the sugar industry must be regarded as an Italian
industry. And, naturally, Giuseppe will employ his
own countrymen in preference to others.
The Italian invasion is not confined to the north
of Queensland. Already some of the choicest lands in
the Childers district are in Italian hands, and every
month or so the area is added to. In a recent issue
of a country paper the following items appeared:—
Among the immigrants arriving by the Bay in
Brisbane were 97 Italians who are proceeding to the
sugai fields of North Queensland. These immigrants
all paid their own fares, and state that they have
work to go to. ...
After harvesting operations had been in swing for
a week the cutters (British) on Plantation
ceased work owing to a dispute over burning. The
Industrial Magistrate is to be asked to arbitrate
Mr. , a late arrival from Italy, has purchased
the sugar farm of Mr. , the price to include this
season’s crop.
Which epitomises current history in the sugar fields.
And what of Giuseppe as a citizen? It must be
admitted that he comes well up to the standard,
taking him all in all. I have never heard of an
Italian asking for Government rations. He does not
figure on the unemployed list because, if he has not
a farm of his own on which to work during the slack
season, his more fortunate countrymen employ him.
He has no use for strikes, and he freely admits that
a man who will work can soon become prosperous in
Queensland. He is law-abiding, though inclined to
be clannish when numbers of his countrymen reside
in the same locality. He is out to hustle a home
together while he is young, and lie is doing it. His
standard of living is quite up to the average, and the
more prosperous he becomes the better he lives.
Many Italians now drive their own cars, and these
are not “Lizzies” either. The fact must be faced
that Giuseppe is going to own the greater part of
the Queensland sugar lands, and, personally, I can
mention no reason why he should not do so.
Labor and Puritanism.
Louis Esson :
The chief danger to the British Labor party, which,
for good or ill, must eventually govern England, is
the steadily-advancing wave of wowserism that threat-
ens to overwhelm it. The old Puritans have left
plenty of descendants: bv no means all of them went
to America. Like the Jews, they have always been
a tough lot, usually acquiring far more power than
their numbers justified. For generations they have
been conspicuous among the Liberals; but now that
the old Liberalism, Asquithian or Lloyd Georgian,
with its platitudes and compromises and freetrade
fetich, is obviously dead and damned, they have been
far-seeing enough to associate themselves with the
nevy Labor party. A member of the house of Cadbury,
which has long been one of the bulwarks of Liberal-
ism, recently went over to Labor; and now that the
old cocoa king has departed to that Bournville from
which no traveller returns, the great Liberal organs
that he controlled, the Daily News and the Star,
will certainly become straight-out Labor papers. It
is clear that the struggle for power soon will be be-
tween the Conservatives, who are still strong in Eng-
land, and the various groups that form that mixed
combination called the Labor party. It would be
a strange state of affairs if the old problems, moral
and political, that worried England from Hexry
VIII.’s time and caused the Civil War, should come
up again in a new form. But it is quite possible;
and though everybody sympathises with the aspira-
tions of the working classes to take their proper
place in the government of the country, it cannot
be assumed that the triumph of the Labor party neces-
sarily means the triumph of the workers " 0 r the
triumph of progress. The people gained nothing
through the overthrow of Charles and the success
of Cromwell. The Puritan regime in England made
things unpleasant for the rich, but ten times more
so for the poor. The British revolution, unlike the
French one, was in many ways reactionary. Fortu-
nately for England, it did not happen sooner! The
Puritans were strong enough in Elizabeth's day to
wage a relentless war against Shakspeare and his
fellows; they drove them from the city, forcing
them to play outside the bounds of respectability, in
the fields and over the river on the Bankside, and
they tried to close the theatres altogether. When they
acquired power through the Civil War they did close
the theatres; but if this had happened two genera-
tions before, there would have been no Elizabethan
drama —the greatest expression we know of the Eng-
lish spirit—and no Shakspeare. A? it was, the later
drama was killed ; and music, for which England was
once famous, was so ill-treated that it is only within
recent times that English composers have dared to
assert themselves. Sport, dancing and all forms of
joyous and energetic life were regarded as Satanic, and
Merrie England, under the Puritans, became a land
of gloom, black coats and mechanical labor. It would
be a tragedy if the British Labor party carried on
the bad old Puritan tradition. Though among its
numbers there are all sorts, artisans and
aristocrats, hard-headed K.C.’s and light-headed
cranks, duffers and demagogues, the wowsers
form a considerable and dangerous group.
Clynes and Thomas are models of propriety, like the
discarded leader, Arthur Henderson, of whom it was
said that the tea-urn had entered into his soul.
The lively G. K. Chesterton never ceased rallying
Phillip Snowden and Ramsay Macdonald on their
milk-and-water doctrines. It would be a tragic satire
on progress if the future democratic England became
like plutocratic America, under wowser rule, with
no freedom, no joy of life, no honest beer, a Cadbury
as Censor of Costume and Literature, and life made
moral by machinery.
•
Papua’s Language Problem.
Dear Bulletin, — Papua is cursed with a
veritable Babel of native tongues and dia-
lects. Every mountain village in the hinter-
land has a language practically its very
REPBTSAL.
"I bet this explosion will annoy those blighters inside .”
own - Along the 300 miles of coast between
the Dutch boundary and Port Moresby there
are 60 villages, speaking at least 10 lan-
guages—so essentially distinct that each
is as different from any other as is Chinese
from Choctaw. For some unaccountable rea-
son, both the administrative and missionary
bodies seem bent on perpetuating the exist-
ing linguistic puzzle. Whilst the various
missionaries devote at least half their time
to collecting vocabularies, compiling bastard
grammars, and translating the Bible into a
multiplicity of languages for a handful of
natives who lack even a script of their
own, the Government insists on its officers
using English (pidgin, of course) in conver-
sation with natives. The absurdity of this
policy is especially manifest and positively
dangerous in matters judicial. Even though
a magistrate might happen to be quite
familiar with, the language of a native giving
evidence, he. is compelled to conduct all the
court talk in English, per medium of his
native “interpreter.” And I dare swear
that there is not one native Papuan suffici-
ently acquainted with English to interpret
exactly the directions for use inscribed on,
say. a packet of Epsom salts. I cannot
discern the Papuan Government’s reason for
departing from the policy pursued in India,
Egypt, Nigeria and other parts of our multi-
colored Empire. In those countries white
officialdom must study stipulated native lan-
guages and pass periodical examinations in
them, or look to be passed out. Motuan—
the language of the Port Moresby people-
only requires to be taken into favor by the
Government and the missions to make it a
perfect Lingua Franca for the whole of
1 apua. Europeans and other natives acquire
quite a comprehensive knowledge of it,
quickly. Its form of expression is emi-
nently suited for the portrayal of native
thought. _ And already it has, by virtue of
its simplicity, utility and popularity, rami-
fied into every district whence natives come
to work. — Lagani-Namo.
Mr. Ness, the house-agent whom one of the
Sydney suburbs sent to the N. S. Wales
Parliament, the other day, with a mission
to uproot the Vatican, has struck another
dud. Edith Fox, a 19-year-old girl, whom
he exhibited about a month ago as a victim
of Papal malpractices—a bright young Aus-
tralian, allegedly, who, but for the fact that
the nuns had refrained from educating her,
might to-day be the intellectual and cultural
equal of Ness himself—-appeared before the
usual expensive Committee, for which the
taxpayers have to provide the money every
time a Ness or a Skelton decides to go nun-
baiting. Last week this body (it consisted
of Inspector of Schools Reay, Dr Harvey
Sutton and Dr. Lorna Hodicinson) found
that Edith was three years below her right
age anatomically, and 10 years below it
mentally. In a supplementary report Dr.
Hodgkinson stated :
Edith Fox represents a case of very definite un-
complicated feeble-mindedness, due to congenital
mental defect. Classified in terms of feeble-
rnindedness, she is a somewhat low-grade moron, and
is the type of case which requires permanent care
and control. The child’s own statement concerning
her running away from the Ashfield Convent showed
ni nwt l act was simply the unpremeditated and
IU-pknned wandering of the feeble-minded rather
eifu dellberate get-away” such as occurs among
girls ot more normal mentality.
It to this paper that M.L.A.’s like
iNess and Skelton, instead of politically
exploiting morons, on the ground of the
latter s lack of education, might profitably
aevoie the time to educating themselves. The
grammar of both these legislators is weak,
and the way in which they habitually mis-
handle the English language in and out"of the
Assembly is a phenomenon to be deplored.
Ettie Rout (London)
The English wowser is one of the most poisonous
forms of organic life; and the female of the species
is more deadly than the male. Preventing the pre-
vention of V.D. is their joint master-stroke, and this
extiact from the proceedings of the National Council
of 11011160 (27/ 9/’22) is an example of how they do
A lengthy discussion took place on the question
ot the treatment of venereal disease, and eventually
a resolution, moved by Mrs. Bethune-Baker, was
carried, recording the conviction of the Council that
it was impossible for public authorities to adopt any
policy of venereal disinfection at public expense with-
out confusing the public conscience.
Contrast such futile irrationalities with this piece
of typical French commonsense from a great Paris
doctor to whom a simple self-disinfection outfit was
submitted: “An encouragement to vice! But of
what use is virtue which depends on fear ? A dis-
couragement to disease which smites the pure equally
with the impure? Yes: one such contrivance as this
might be the means of saving a thousand children,
yet unborn, from misery and ruin.”
“Wilfbido” : A writer in Current Opinion
gives chapter and verse for some facts and
figures which are right up against the con-
tention that prohibition has been an unquali-
fied success in the U.S. The Metropolitan
Life Insurance Company, holding 14 million
policies, reports that for 1920 and 1921 there
were 162 deaths from wood-alcohol poison-
ing, while prior to those years it was a com-
paratively rare occurrence to have one death
from that cause. A single Christmas season
in Massachusetts and Connecticut saw 190
deaths and innumerable cases of blindness
and paralysis directly attributable to one
particularly virulent consignment of bootleg
whisky—lfor which the seller got 23,500 dol-
lars instead of 10 years’ hard. The alcoholic
ward in the Bellevue Hospital (N.Y.) re-
cords 2686 admissions in 1921 as against 623
in 1919. The home-brew has proved just as
vile as the bootleg stuff. According to Dr.
Gettler, a surgical chemist whose specialty
is alcohol, it may easily turn out to be “a
coroner’s cocktail.” To these inferior
brands of whisky, which do not kill with
the amazing quickness of wood-alcohol, but
work on the body steadily and surely, the
reporter traces such diseases as cirrhosis of
the liver and chronic gastritis.
“Ashmead” : Shippers to the U.K. from
northern Tas. have been complaining to the
manager of the Commonwealth line. Their
principal kick was against the high freight
on fruit. The Speck sent away 1,300,000-odd
cases of fruit last season, and had to pay
6s. a case freight. The average price paid
in England was 12s. 3d. a case, which just
equals the cost of production from the time
of picking to the moment of purchase. On
income from some other source the orchard-
ist has to maintain his trees in health with
sprays and fertilisers, buy new seedlings
pay rates and taxes on his land, feed and
clothe himself and family, and meet his
other obligations. The average price in
England has been higher before the war,
often about 30s. a case, and fruit was then
sent 24 cases to the ton as against 18 at
piesent. In the former days it carried per-
lectly, and kept well, while last season only
a lew shipments reached the market un-
attected with ‘‘brown heart,” which shipping
profiteers tried to palm off as latent disease
contracted on the tree, but which since has
been agreed upon as due to suffocation of
the fruit in the ship’s hold. Kneen said he
was practically powerless as regarded the
requested drop from six to four bob a ton
m freight, as the line was controlled' by
Larkin in far-away London. Still, a re-
duction to ss. has been granted, and he
would try for a further bite. He didn’t
reckon he could take more than 20 cases to
the ton on the ships nowadays. Another
outrageous anomaly is found in the differen-
tiation against Tasmania in freight rates. At
present 20s. a ton is charged extra on goods
t 0 1,,, J asmaman ports, because a dav and a
bt extra steaming is required to reach
the Derwent and Hobart. Shipments to
Launceston, which are taken just inside the
-Lamar and dumped on to lighters to save
the ocean-goers’ time, also come under the
quid imposition, for the reason that the Der-
went is so far away from the mainland !
Ihe fact that the Tamar is right in the
track of the Commonwealth boats plying to
England makes no difference—at present.

POLTTICAL POINTS
One of the consequences of sending Pearce
to America for jin £B5OO holiday is the arri-
val of a cute Canadian Minister in search
of Tariff concessions. The Canucks broached
the subject when Pearce visited Ottawa;
after looking him over, from his silk hat to
his spats, they must have decided that a Gov-
ernment in which such a person was second
in order of precedence would be easy. And
doubtless it would have been easy had the
Canadian gentleman come earlier, even
though his country, in the last two recorded
years, sold Australia £7,065,900 worth «of
goods and bought £441,000 worth of Aus-
tralian produce. But he arrived at the
wrong time to get an agreement from Pearce’s
crowd. They are too busy preparing for
their own funeral.
Following on a proclamation that any
unauthorised person taken with arms in
his hands would be liable to the death penalty,
the Irish Free State Government has had
five Irregulars executed. Four were un-
known at this end, but the fifth was Erskine
Childers, Protestant and English-born, and
reputedly the brains of the rebel organisa-
tion. When McSwiney died of his hunger-
strike, the Sydney Labor aldermen announced
that he had been murdered by the Saxon
Government. A few remarks by the same
persons on the execution of Childers might
improve the shining hour.
There will be no row in Vic. over the
appointment of an Acting-Premier when
Lawson sails on Jan. 6. McPherson, the
Treasurer, will, as a matter of right, take
charge. Watt asserted his right 11 years
ago when Jack Murray was about to go to
the coronation of George V., and George
Graham, who was up till then regarded as
joint head of the Ministry, stood aside.
“Gallery” : Higgs being no longer “a toad
in a cesspool,” the Priminister is employing
the malodorous allusion, of which he is mor-
bidly fond, against his old pal Piddington.
Alluding to a Piddington pamphlet, he said
that if there was one scintilla of truth in the
document, it was “like a jewel lurking in a
cesspool and uncontaminated by its filthy
surroundings.” Compare Frank Brennan’s
reference to the two candidates who are
trying to beat him in Batman (Vic.) “Each
of my opponents,” said Brennan “is laboring
under a disadvantage: one that he isn’t
known; the other that he is.” That polished
gibe is worth a sewerful of septic-tank
similes.
Having struggled through its first session,
the N.S.W. Fuller Government is safe for at
least seven months. Its most considerable
achievement was the passage of the agreement
for the construction by Victoria of* four
railways north of the Murray. It also tem-
pered the blast of the income-tax to the
shorn middle-class, and rescued some perish-
ing industries by repealing the Labor Gov-
ernment’s Forty-four Hours Act. Another
proceeding in which a flash of courage was
shown was the restoration of the Public
Service Board as the body controlling de-
partmental salaries, instead of the Arbitra-
tion Court. But all the sand ran out of
the Government when the Sydney dailies
demanded the Harbor Bridge Bill. A State
which has to meet 24J millions of loans
in two years, and has made no provision for
repayment, can’t afford such luxuries as
£7,000,000 bridges. This was politely con-
veyed to Puller when he asked for 10 mil-
lions and was told that the market wasn’t
healthy. And the dismal story will be
amplified when he gets to London.
The Campbells ar* coming in Speck poli-
tics. One of the clan, the first of the name
for generations to figure as a Tas. M.H.A.,
got in for Wilmot last June. Two others
aopear as candidates for the Federal seats
of Darwin and Wilmot. All are C.P.’s.
As everybody knew it would do before-
hand, the Select Committee of Vic. Assembly
has x’ecommended the passing of the Min-
istry’s Electricity Bill, including the ratifica-
tion of the purchase of the North Melbourne
works by the Monash-Gibson-Lyle Commis-
sion. The committee consisted of six Min-
isterial members and Lind, of the Hayseeders:
It isn’t the first time Lind has helped to
save the Government.
“Peri” removes his eye from the keyhole
of the gate, and speaks:—
The notion that Australian Labor displays a Bol-
shevik contempt for the marriage tie to practical
purpose, by yielding broadcast to polygamy, still
has its supporters, and one of them —Theo. Hook
Hill of the N. S. Wales Ass. —does not hesitate on
occasion to voice the faith which is in him. As an
LOUD APPLAUSE.
“If the Labor party were returned it would cut Defence expenditure to a pre-war figure. Compul-
sory training would be abolished, and a voluntary system introduced.”— Charlton’s Labor Manifesto.
instanee, during the dying hours of the late session,
W. R. Fitzsimons, M.L.A. for Cumberland, was
advocating that more doctors and dentists
should be appointed to the public schools.
A Laborite doubted if Hill would agree to
anything so socialistic. Fitzsimons unwarily
remarked that the Oxley M.L.A. was “not a
family man.” Maddened at the Laborite who had pro-
voked the incident Hill rose, pointed to the Opposition
benches, and thundered in a manner as near as he ever
gets to that of William Pitt the elder: “I am a mar-
ried man without children, but many of those opposite
me have plenty of children and never had wives.”
For combined power and subtlety the mot was recog-
nised as the gem of the evening—but then .the
Assembly isn’t an exigent body these days, even
when sober.
With the harbor of recess in sight, the Vic.
Dawson crew is making desperate efforts to
avoid rocks. Recollecting that a majority
of the Assembly favors the suspension of
liquor-option polls. Skipper Lawson rebuked
the cold-tea hunch for its intolerance when
it sent a deputation to remonstrate with
him about his little Licensing Bill. Bo’sn
Oman, however, evened up things by sur-
rendering to the W.C.T.U. when it protested
against Sunday games in the parks, as pro-
posed by Melbourne Council. So that the
Uppah Chambah won’t get snaky when the
rush of bills comes in the last week (Dec.
12, 13, 14, 15) the Two-Hundred-a-Year Bill
(for its members) will be brought on then.
Thus the hope of reward will sweeten labor.
The Argus is euphemistic:—
The fact that there are large estates is due to the
stupid land laws passed by earlier Parliaments. The
granting of small blocks in place of large leaseholds
impelled many hundreds of men to take up land,
though they lacked the qualities essential to success,
and the result was that gradually the failures passed
on, leaving their blocks in the possession of the few
who were successful. ,
Apd sometimes the holder of the big adjacent
estate took particular care to shift the small
holder on to where other glories waited him,
and sometimes the former hired the latter
not to be too strenuous a holder, that is, not
to hang on with cat-like tenacity, and every
clause of the Act, to the land the big neigh-
bor envied him. But it is yet too early in
the day to expect the Argus to recognise the
hand of the dummyer.
These are days in which a candidate who
sings a bit has an immense advantage over the
sort of aspirant who can merely churn out
dull platitudes. Jackson, M.H.R. for Bass
(Tas.), is a case in point. Jackson opened
his campaign at Scottsdale on a Monday
night in the presence of the usual policeman.
On Tuesday he went to Bridport, and bright-
ened his meeting with a few ditties. The same
night he motored 13 miles to Scottsdale,
where he “obliged” at a concert, and initi-
ated the congregation into the joys of com-
munity singing. At Legerwood, on Wednes-
day, he preluded his denunciation of the Bol-
shies with a lecture on the Northern Terri-
tory. On Thursday he held forth at a circus
which he happened to strike at Derby. On
Friday he provided half the programme at
another concert. When last heard of he had
joined forces with the circus, and was giving
a brisk seven-minutes’ political act in between
the sword-swallower and the educated
baboon.
“Gallery”: I am expecting to hear at any
moment that Sovietism has suddenly become
militant and is menacing the lives of Hughes
and his colleagues. Billy’s gent.-help,
Wally Marks, has already informed us that
he has received three anonymous letters
promising him an early exit from this vale
of tears. Then Pearce went to an election
meeting in Westralia, entirely surrounded by
policemen-—he had six for a roll-up of 25
and spoke in fear and trembling of Bolshe-
vik plots. Followed the rumor, widely dis-
seminated in Melbourne, that Attorney-
General Groom had suffered a motor acci-
dent, which was darkly attributed to Com-
munist agents. After this Hughes cannot
be content with his present safety. He will
really have to be discovered tied to the rail-
way track, with the Melbourne-Sydney ex-
press about 10 seconds away. In the dis-
tressful condition of “Nationalism” some
such expedient is essential.
C. F. Hughes (manager Union Steamship
Co.) writes: —
Referring to the comments (B. 23/11/’22) on
the Moeraki and crew. The stokehold manning is
fixed by M.L. Government regulations, and not by
the owners. The scale provides for nine firemen
and six trimmers, but, as has been the case with
several other vessels, the Moeraki carried “under
duress” 12 firemen and nine trimmers, six over the
required complement. Three men left in Sydney, leav-
ing 15 men, still three in excess of the legal man-
ning. The whole of the stokehold hands came
ashore just as the vessel was on the point of
sailing with about 250 people on board, including
many women and children, who were not in a posi-
tion to make arrangements to get lodgings ashore,
and the Company kept all the passengers on board
for two days free of expense, in the hope that the
men would return to the ship. A large number
of these passengers are still stranded in Sydney,
many of them under distressing circumstances. The
Seamen’s Union were unable to replace the three
men, though it is stated there were several hundred
of their members out of employment. The object of
the crew is to flout the award of the Maoriland
Arbitration Court, whose awards they have religiously
observed in the past, when they carried an increase
in wages which the employers have always paid
from the date of the award, no matter where the
ship was trading. On this occasion the award meant
a decrease in wages. The men had, and still have,
an opportunity of terminating their sentence by
returning to the ship and carrying out the agree-
ment entered into in Maoriland.
Hughes’s majority has already disappeared.
Including Speaker Johnson, he had 38 sup-
porters, or nominal supporters, in the last
House of Reps. But Burchell (Fremantle)
has resigned, and will be succeeded either
by Hedges, who was a Liberal in two Par-
liaments, or by a Labor man. Livingston
(Barker) has been pushed out by the S.A.
Liberal Union. Atkinson (Wilmot) has
seceded to the Country party, and Watt
(Balaclava) announced last week that under
no circumstances would he support Hughes
as Priminister. For the rest, Best (Koo-
vong), Blundell (Adelaide), Bayley (Oxley),
Chanter (Iliverina), Foley (Kalgoorlie),
Higgs (Capricornia), Lamond (Illawarra),
Lister (Corio), Maxwell (Fawkner), Laird
Smith (Denison), Story (Boothby) and
Wise (Gippsland) are being strenuously
opposed by anti-llughesites, and at least four
of the 12 are sure to go. And there is no
chance of the Government’s redressing the
balance by winning seats from the other
parties. Hughes said recently that if he
were returned with 30 followers he would
still be Priminister. But he won’t have 30
followers. He may not even have 20.
Touching the prospects in Queensland: —
The sins of the Theodores are going to be visited
on Charlton and his crowd. Mainly for that reason
Donald Charles Cameron will hold Brisbane, which
used to be safe for Labor, against little Frank Burke.
Nevertheless Bayley, in Oxley, will have no easy job
to defeat the bulldog, Jim Sharpe. Sharpe is ex-
tremely popular ; Bayley isn’t. Moreton sadly misses
Wienholt, for whose seat three unknowns are run-
ning. Brewer, the C.P. man, looks to have the best
chance. George Mackay will easily hold Lilley. His
last majority was only 11,000, and he expects 13,000
this time over Costello, who dubs himself the “Re-
construction-by-Referendum candidate.” It will take
an expedition to discover the remains of this new
party after December 16. For Wide Bay E. B. C.
Oorser, of the vanished whiskers, is being opposed
by two farmers; and the C.P. candidate, Heading
(the other calls himself Labor), may succeed in
doing it at the poll. McDonald is a certainty for Ken-
nedy, and J. A. J. Hunter is pretty sure to retain
Maranoa, which was once the life-property of Jim
Page. Bamford should be all right in Herbert, and
Littleton Groom isn’t a bit alarmed by the
apparition in the Darling Downs of a McDougall
who is described in the nomination-papers as of “no
occupation.” A Scot with no occupation is an
anomaly. Higgs looks to be in dire trouble up
Capricornia way, but things may not be as bad as
they seem. Anyhow, the old campaigner doesn’t
share the dismal forebodings of the Brisbane scribes.
Labor has the brainiest Senate candidates in Jensen,
the geologist (he is a doctor of Science), and J. V.
Macdonald, who took Adamson’s place, and is a
journalist of parts. In a straight-out election and
in Queensland’s present mood neither would have a
hope of being returned ; but the interposition of the
Country party alters the whole aspect of affairs.
Anything may happen to the dozen aspirants or to .
any one of them.
A WORD IN SEASON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Merrett, one of the Liberal candidates for
the Senate, speaking at Shepparton (Vic.) said he
knew an individual to whom Mr. Hughes said,
“Hurry up with that testimonial —1 am not going
to wait any longer for it.”
Spontaneous tributes to myself
I always reckon pleasant.
Whether in trinketry or pelf
I never dodge a present;
And rigidly though I eschew
Direct and naked bumming,
A chap may say a word or two
When something he accounts his due
Is overlong in coming.
One couldn’t start the tambourine
To swell one’s private riches
Without inviting outcry keen
About a palm that itches.
’Twould be a little more than odd;
The world askance would view it.
But when you’re hailed a sort of god,
Like Jove of old you need but nod —•
Some underling will do it.
Amazement sheer, complete' surprise
With thanks, of course, you’ll mingle
When out before your bulging eyes
They heap the rustling jingle.
A soft reminder, pending that,
May be accelerating,
A prompter’s whisper: “Send the hat
Round at a somewhat brisker bat,
I’m sick and tired of waiting.”

Each year’s profit is made up of the surplus
from underwriting plus the net income from
investments. The figures for the past three

Insurance cos. throughout the world have
been experiencing abnormally heavy losses,
and similar conditions have been experienced
with local underwriting. A recent return
from the N.S.W. Statistician showed that
fire premiums in that State for the 12 months
ended June 30 last amounted to £1,884,509,
losses totalled £1,192,576 (63.3 p.c.) and
expenses £796,038 (42.2 p.c.), the total out-
go being £1,988,614, or £104,105 in
excess of premium receipts. An examination
of the United accounts, however, shows that
relatively heavier costs affected profits more
than larger losses. This comparison details
underwriting performances over a long
period:—

The loss rate last year was four points higher
than for 1921, but 5.1 was added to the
expense ratio. Gross premiums fell from
£595,095 to £597,491, owing to lower values
ruling, but the management could not cut
costs. Net premium income was £24,73S
down, but commissions and branch exes, in-
creased £1330, and salaries and other exes,
took £2399 more. Taxes were £1299 easier,
and about £lOOO was saved on advertising
and printing. But the year’s gross expendi-
ture was £1312 larger than for the previous
term, and the expense rate was higher than
in any other year. The underwriting profit
was only 9.1 p.c. of net premiums.
The United is so sound that not only have
the year’s profits given shareholders their
usual 10 p.c., but they were also ample to
provide £25,000 of bonus scrip, proprietors
receiving one new £lO share paid to £5 for
every 12 held. This bonus issue takes paid
capital to £325,000, and as £35,000-odd is
derived from investments, interest on funds
alone provides the 10 p.c. div., leaving the
whole of the underwriting surplus avail-
able for strengthening the concern. Dur-
ing the past 10 years £200,000 of
reserves have been issued as bonus
scrip, increasing capital from £125,000
to £325,000, so 10 p.c. on that lot will
mean 26 p.c. to old holders who acquired
scrip at par. The amounts distributed in
divs. have increased more in proportion
than the growth of business: £30,000 was
paid to shareholders last year compared with
£10,675 10 years ago; net premiums have
increased from £143,309 to £259.675. The
improved return from investments has helped,
though. The £275.000 of funds in 1912 were
earning about 31 p.c.; nowadays, £687,000 is
producing slightly more than 5 p.c., the im-
provement of If p.c. giving approximately
£12,000 more on present funds and equal to
4 p.c. on paid capital.
September 30 closed the United’s 60th year,
and the accounts show it to be a powerful
underwriter. Funds totalled almost £687,000
and exceeded 2J times net premium income.
Funds 1| times premiums are usually re-
garded as reasonable backing for policies.
Incidentally, 1118,000 of funds were re-
served for unexpired risks, or more than 45
p.c. of premiums instead of the customary
40 p.c. Assets are of first-class quality:
£516,962 of Government securities, cash and
branch balances; £53,757 of mortgages,
£60,831 of debentures, freehold premises with
a book value of £104,281, and £30,491 of
book debts.

Robert Reid and Co. was caught badly when
softgoods values slumped. It was "heavily
loaded with high-priced goods, and was com-
mitted to further large shipments, and
though £300.000 was set aside after the
1921 balance to permit the writing down of
stocks, the latest balance-sheet shows profits
only slightly in excess of the amounts re-
quired for pref. divs. Twelve months ago
stocks on hand had a book value of
£1,795,981 and stocks in course of delivery,
£167,179 —together £1,963,160. Stocks on
hand in July last totalled £995,453 and
new season’s goods £403,188, together
£1,398,641. This figure, the directors’ report
says, represents “the final readjustment of
stock cost prices to replacement values.”
Including the £72,709 of internal reserves
brought to light to assist the writing-down
of stocks, and after paying pref. divs. and
an average of 6J p.c. on ordinaries, £311.574
would appear to have been lost, an amount
exceeding half the paid capital. That was
the position as disclosed by the latest
accounts, but since their publication the
directors have admitted that they do not
altogether conform to the auditor’s certifi-
cate and “exhibit a true and correct view
of the state of the co.’s affairs.” The direc-
tors announced in their report that the 5
p.c. on ordinaries was to be paid out of ordi-
nary share dividend reserve, and that the
distribution would “not involve any reduc-
tion in the general or other reserves shown
by the balance-sheet.” Later, at the meet-
ing, chairman Bates announced that “por-
tion” of the £300,000 stoek-depreoiation re-
serve “had been absorbed, and the balance
which remained was included with the ordi-
nary share div. reserve in the balance-sheet
under the heading of sundry creditors.”
Since reserves of unspecified dimensions are
included with liabilities, the published
balance-sheet does not disclose the true posi-
tion of the co.
The public’s interests are restricted almost
entirely to the 6 p.c. debentures, 7 p.c. prefs.
and the quarter-million of 8 p.c. prefs. which
were issued when high prices were strain-
ing the co.’s financial position. Allowing
cover for the debentures and Ist prefs.—
their security is, of course, excellent —after
payment of the latest divs. the £250,000 of
2nd prefs. were supported by assets with a
book value of approximately a million, or
£4 for every £1 invested.

This co. has had a wonderful year. The
published accounts do not show such hand-
some results as those in the table. They
give net profits at £24,329 after providing
£10,720 for depreciation of buildings, mach-
inery and plant, etc. An examination of the
balance-sheet, however, shows that besides the
visible appropriations specific reserves have
had £18,063 added, and as these reserves
are now obviously far in excess of actual
depreciation and other requirements—fixed
assets total £89,735 and specific reserves
amount to £39,695, or an accumulation ex-
ceeding 44 p.c. in two years—in the table
the additions to the reserves are included
with profits. The actual net profit for the
year was £53,112 less any portion of that
amount required for depreciation, and the
same qualification applies to the £46,073
of reserves shown by the table. In the re-
construction of only two years ago the whole
of the specific reserves then on hand, with
the exception of between £7OOO and £BOOO
laid aside for taxes, was capitalised, and
£20,000 or so of internal reserves were
brought to light. In those circumstances,
possibly the whole of the £46,073 can be re-
garded as genuine stored profit. Inciden-
tally, when estimating the year’s earnings,
stocks on hand were ‘‘appraised at cost or
market value, whichever was the lower.”
The expansion of this co.’s business has
been phenomenal. For many years the man-
agement had been developing and improving
a modest cardboard-box trade, and when the
Avar costs of tin-plate restricted the use of
metal containers, Fielding’s had the plant
and enterprise to show what it could do in
the way of substitutes. Only six years ago
paid capital was £24,068. But it did so well
out of the war-time activity that, after pay-
ing very handsome divs., it has since capi-
talised £75,334 of reserves. Much of the
war-time business has been retained, while
the expansion of local manufacturing has
also opened up new fields. When costly
stocks were putting a strain on the co.
£20,000 cf 7 p.c. prefs. were issued. Last
year the whole of this money was repaid, and
capital uoav amounts to £llO,OOO in £l-paid
ordinaries. The following table shows how
balance-sheet figures have moved since the
first month of the war, and also states the
co.’s present position :

At September 30 the surplus of stocks, book
debts, investments and cash over and above
liabilities was £74,588. Deducting the final
div.—which, incidentally, made the return
for the year p.c. on capital prior to the
reconstruction—£66,33B of the £llO,OOO
capital was represented by liquid assets. The
£43,662 not so covered was backed by pro-
perty with a book value of £42,947, and
machinery, plant, etc., with a book value of
£46,788. Taking into consideration the re-
construction of only two years ago, which
absorbed all visible and some hidden re-
serves, the backing for shareholders disclosed
by the latest accounts is astonishing.

This rubber-plantation co. did better last
year than could have been expected. The
rubber market crashed so badly that an aver-
age of only 7;|d. per lb. was won from a
restricted output, but the management was
able to cut f.o.b. costs to 7.3 d. After paying
administration exes, and setting aside £452
for depreciation a net loss of £l2OO resulted.
In two years reserves have been tapped for
£4247, but there is still a balance of £9340
to draw upon. Practically the whole of this
reserve, however, has been utilised to de-
velop the plantation, and the management’s
difficulty is to finance operations until the
clouds lift. At June 30 £3126 was oiving
to the bank and other creditors, and liquid
assets, including unsold rubber, amounted
to only £lOOO. Market prospects are still
not bright, but a decline on last year’s low
average which will give Bukit Kubu trouble
is unlikely: manager M. L. Phillips expects
to harvest 210.0001 b. for the current year,
and to reduce the f.o.b. cost to fijd- This

During the five years 1916-20 divs. totalling
85 p.c. were distributed. Since the slump
the directors have probably regretted their
haste in passing out fat divs. instead of
accumulating a cash reserve which would
have made the enterprise free of outside
financial aid. Nevertheless, Ilukit Kubu is
in a much better position than many other
plantation cos. The last of its fields is now
coming into bearing, and the 653 acres are
"in good condition and very free from
disease.”

The Southern Union General Insur-
ance Co. of Australasia, Ltd. —Six weeks
ago The Bulletin drew attention to several
unusual features in connection with the
flotation and capitalisation of this insurance
co. The directors having failed to respond
to the invitation to clear away any mis-
understandings, the “Wild Cat” has con-
structed the story of the float from the
official records: —
Two prospectuses were issued: one dated July 30,
1920, and the other February 21, 1921, the latter
including the names of the directors appointed. Both
announced George Abbott as the promoter; and
they provided for commission on placing scrip not
to exceed “8 p.c. on the nominal value” of the £1
shares. The prospectus added that “save for this
commission, no amount has been paid or is intended
to be paid to any promoter.”
Subscribers were invited to make application
“direct to Security Underwriters Pty., Ltd., or to
any brokers authorised to collect,” a contract dated
July 2,8, 1920, having been entered into by the
“Security Underwriters Company” and the insurance
co. The Companies Act did not require this agree-
ment to be filed, but copies were available for inspec-
tion at the offices of the insurance co.’s solicitors.
It was also announced that George Abbott had in-
terests in the “Security Underwriters Company” and
was “therefore an interested party in the agree-
ment.” These statements were made to comply
with Sec. 88 of the Companies Act, which requires a
prospectus to give full particulars of the nature and
extent of the interest of every director in the promo-
tion of a co.
One question which arises is whether the “Security-
Underwriters Company” mentioned by the February,
1921, prospectus was actually in existence at that
date. On June 1, 1920, George Abbott filed a
notice of registration of the “Security Underwriters
Company” with himself as sole proprietor of the
firm. On August 18, 1920, the “Security Under-
writers Proprietary, Limited,” was registered as a
proprietary co. There were only two shareholders:
Mrs. Mina Abbott (250 shares) and George Abbott
(50). Returns lodged in August, 19.21, and in
August this year disclosed that the shares had been
called up to Is. each, and that the total paid capi-
tal was only £l5.
This was the underwriting concern which, under
its agreement, had to June 30 last received
£101,517 commission on shares in which the insur-
ance co. (of whicli George Abbott was a director)
had called up £353,885. But that is only one
aspect of the “underwriting.” The insurance
business did not warrant additional capital, but
this £l5 co. continued to sell shares far in excess
of the requirements of the insurance co. Further-
more, the “underwriters” sold scrip at a premium,
first of all at 2s. 6d. per share, and later at 45., the
latter representing a premium of 100 p.c., the £1
shares being called to only 4s. The position of the
insurance co., as disclosed by its balance-sheet as at
June 30, showed no justification whatever for any
premium. These accounts also failed to disclose
what had happened to the premiums collected.
Precisely how much Mr. Abbott’s £l5 co. won
from the flotation is not ascertainable. No doubt
the cost of canvassing must have been heavy.
“Underwriting” having apparently been completed,
on September 27 last a special resolution was filed
with the Registrar-General intimating that the
Security Underwriters Pty., Ltd., was to be volun-
tarily wound up.
The formation of a special co. with a capital
of only £l5 to handle the issue cif a
2,000,000-share concern, is something new
in co. flotation. It was evidently also unique
in underwriting. Whether the S.U.P.
guaranteed a minimum share subscription
The Bulletin does not know. If it did
not, it stood to lose nothing, and its share-
holders had prospects of a big harvest.
The Southern Union flotation provides very
definite evidence of the necessity for an
amendment of the Act compelling both pro-
moters and underwriters to file full particu-
lars of their undertakings, and additions
defining and controlling underwriting of
share issues, and requiring the regis-
tration of underwriters. In this in-
stance, the directors of the insurance
co. apparently had no control over the issue
of shares or the price which the public
was to be invited to pay for them. The
disclosure by the first accounts that consider-
ably more capital had been raised than the
insurance business warranted; that 100 p.c.
premium was then being asked on additional
subscriptions, though the balance-sheet
showed a deficit of £102,210 —these have been
features of the Southern Union float which
mark it as one of the most remarkable
examples of public co. finance the Common-
wealth has had. They are matters which,
of course, affect only shareholders. The
large capital in relation to risks obviouslv
makes the Southern Union a satisfactory
insurance office from the point of view of
policy-holders.

St. Helier’s Coal Co., Ltd. —This is
the latest co. to tackle the Greta seams.
The property adjoins the Muswellbrook col-
liery, and a 150 ft. tunnel has proved 20ft.
of clean coal. D. A. W. Robertson and
H. J. Thomas both approve the proposition,
the former estimating that 81,900,000 tons
should be available. Allowing for losses in
working such a thick seam, . he estimates
a workable tonnage of 61 millions, giving
a life of 246 years with a quarter-million
annual output. The property is on the
Sydney-Brisbane railway ? “with access to
the large and ever-growing market in the
North.” It is proposed to equip the mines
to output 300 tons daily, and to connect
with the railway. Nominal capital is
£55.000 in £1 shares. The public is offered
33,500 of these shares, and the vendors are
to get 11,200 fully-paids, but no cash, in
full payment of their interests in the pro-
perties to be absorbed. The 10,300 balance
of shares is to be held in reserve.
* * * *
Last week the cables announced that the
British B. 11. directors had received an offer,
“on the basis of 355. per share,” from in-
terests controlling the B. 11. Associated
Smelters. Until further details are dis-
closed, there’s little to say. But in the
light of recent events the offer is decidedly
interesting, and if the proposal is finalised
it won’t be the first occasion the British
mine has been in “control” hands. The co.
was floated in 1887 by the B. 11. Prop.—it
took over blocks 15 and 16 of that
co.’s ground—the purchase price being
£1,075,000, £675,000 in cash and the balance
in shares. Capital was increased from
£1,200,000 to £1,320,000 in 1890 by the
issue of 60,000 £2 prefs. Five years later
it was reduced to £264,000 by cancelling £4
per £5 ordinary and 325. per £2 pref., but
was increased to £339,000 10 years ago
when additional working funds were
required. Production to date has aggre-
gated almost five millions, and £821,280
has been distributed. Ore reserves are
estimated at 1,071,611 tons going 12.4
p.c. lead, 11.3 p.c. zinc and 6.90 z.
silver. With respect to further ore supplies
geologist E. C. Andrews says “there is a
decided necessity for the mapping of the
whole structure.... so as to indicate the
existence of local bulges and spurs of im-
portance which may exist below the 1200 ft.
level and to the east of the present ore
bodies.” W. H. Woodhead, who pulled the
£o. through its troubles of the ’nineties, is
still managing-director, and on his recent
trip to Australia he showed he had not lost
his old-time dash. But he has been a sick
man, and that, possibly, partly explains the
recent negotiations.
* * # #
The Lander Oil-field (Australia), Ltd., is
something entirely new in local oil-floats.
Capital is a quarter-million in shares of £1
each; 150,000 go to vendors, 100,000 are
contribs., and the balance of 50,000 are to
be held in reserve. But there is to be no
invitation to the public, and scrip gambling
is not to be encouraged:—
At the inception of the matters which will cul-
minate in the registration of the co., the members
of the original syndicate, who are now the vendors
to the co., decided that there should be no public
prospectus or public flotation in the ordinary accepta-
tion of these terms, and were prepared to personally
subscribe all the capital necessary to carry the
matter to a conclusion. They also decided that if
public moneys were allowed into the co. there
should not be (as far as they were able to stop it)
any gambling in the shares until the first bore had
been completed, and, until then, no application will
be made to list the co. on the Stock Exchange.
This is from a circular issued giving a
“resume of what has taken place from in-
ception to date, and is for private circula-
tion only amongst hona fide intending sub-
scribers.” All cash subscribed is to be
“applied entirely to the co.’s business” and
the vendors
have demonstrated their confidence in Dr. Milsom
by guaranteeing £25,000 in respect of the 50,000
shares open for subscription. This guarantee is
given without any underwriting or other remunera-
tion. As an inducement to the subscribing share-
holders not to traffic in their shares, the co. will
give to each original applicant for contributing
shares an option, exercisable on the completion
of the first bore, of taking up at par an equal
number of shares to those allotted to him on his
original application. This option will be strictly
limited to the original applicant, and will not
enure for the benefit of his transferee.
Approximately 12,000 acres near Orallo,
33 miles north-west of Roma (Q.), is the
area to be attacked. Dr. Milsom, a Cali-
fornian-trained oil-geologist, who has had con-
siderable experience opening up fields else-
where, spent four months in the district
prior to inducing the Government to grant
rights to the co. Structural survey, work
is now proceeding on the area, and in an-
other two months it is hoped to decide on
the site for the first bore. Milsom says
there is evidence of petroleum north, south, east
and west of the area; the gas horizon is approxi-
mately 1728 ft. below the uppermost strata. I
have not enough detailed work done on The field
to estimate the actual depth of the. supposed oil
horizon. That work is now proceeding. Organic
debris is abundant, averaging between eight and
nine per cent. If the percentage of petroleum in
a series were only 0.10 p.c., with a thickness of
500 ft. it would yield 2,000,000 barrels of oil for
every square mile. Every condition required in an
oil field prospect is in evidence at Orallo. De-
tailed work and the drill are now required.
Milsom, in one of tlie most thorough reports
so far prepared on an Australian oil pro-
position, states that, geologically, Orallo bears
a striking resemblance to the Lander field
(Wyoming, U.S.A.), and the co. has adopted
that title for its venture. A modern plant
is being ordered, and Dr. Milsom, who. has
been signed up to the co. as managing-direc-
tor for 10 years, “is positive he will pro-
duce oil in ' substantial commercial quanti-
ties within a year.”

“If the mine is anything like the dazzling
property the report speaks of, suspension of
work is sheer folly, and should be obliterated
at once; an idle mine merely eats away pop-
pet-heads.” These are published comments
on Occidental, Cobar (N.S.W.), last report.
They are all very well from the point of view
of the man who hasn’t to dip his hands into
his pockets to produce the wherewithal to
“obliterate” the idleness. But it is a differ-
ent case for the other man who is confronted
with the fact that the co. is already in debt
to the amount of £23,602, and estimates
(submitted by Mines officials) that to bring
the mine to a productive stage expenditure
has to be incurred as follows: Underground
work, £S000; remodelling plant, £20,000
(“this must be regarded as a minimum esti-
mate”) ; wages, and other expenses between
re-starting and first sale of gold, £8000; or
a total cash requirement (including debts)
of about £60,000. The co. was unsuccessful
in its application to the Government for a
grant of £13,500. The inspectors’ report
on this proposal is contained in the depart-
mental publication for 1921. The co.’s
failure is attributed to the “faulty plant”
and not to the grade of ore supplied to it,
which averaged nearly 9|dwt. “Nothing has
happened which should prejudice one’s faith
in the mine, and, provided it is not over-
loaded with capital, and given a suitable and
an efficient plant, its prospects are as good
as ever.” According to the balance-sheet
the co. spent £17,146 on mine development;
buildings £2722, and machinery and plant
£49;892, total £69,760. During its exist-
ence of about 30 years Occidental has pro-
duced £787,000 worth of gold, and old cos.
paid £78,000 in divs. The installation of
the “faulty plant” led to the most unfortu-
nate failure connected with gold-mining in
the State. That a mine which shows an
average grade of ore of 9dwt. at 600 ft., im-
proving to lldwt. at 700 ft., should not be at
work is most unsatisfactory, but it is hardly
conceivable that, loaded with such an incubus
as it is, local enterprise will ever be equal to
re-starting it. The only hope for that is
in the report that Mt. Boppy Co. manager
Negus has been instructed to co-operate with
the Occidental Co. with a view to resumption
of work which, if arrangements can be made
between the two cos., will probably be limited
to testing- the ore-body at a further depth of
100 ft.

“Work on the Muriel Tank field is gradu-
ally being abandoned. The movement has
been accelerated by the serious lack of water,
even for drinking purposes.” -That is an
excuse which is hoary with antiquity. The
real reason is the “serious lack” of gold.
Given a reasonable supply of that, there
would be no lack of water. Muriel Tank,
fortunately,, did not “catch on” to any extent
with the speculative public. At the outset
there was a doubt about the field owing to
the fact that mining magnates who have
reason to be eager to acquire good local
“prospects” declined to identify themselves
with it.
* * * *
Burraga (N.S.W.), famous as a location
of the once-prosperous Lloyd copper-mine,
now has a gold-mine called the Big
Ben. Samples of ore taken from it by
the local Warden are reputed to have assayed
16oz. per ton; other samples taken by the
syndicate showed Boz. The Warden adds
that the assay obtained by him “may have
been accidentally a particularly good sample,
very much richer than a fair average.” The
Warden cannot be complimented on this
admission; it was his- official duty to get a
“fair averagesample”—or u°ue at all.
Assay of a “specimen” can- only be mislead-
ing. However, it doesn’t matter much in
this case, as the officer reports “that all
available land in the vicinity has been taken
up, a fact which should prevent others from
wasting their time and money in hurrying
to the locality.”
# * # *
Westralia’s State prospecting party has
returned to Perth and been paid off. No
official announcement has yet been made re-
garding the party’s achievements, but a yarn
comes from Laverton that several promising
gold-bearing reefs have been located and
will be prospected later on under the direc-
tion and control of the State Prospecting
Board. Another report states that these
reefs have been tried over and over again
by other parties and turned down, and that
the State’s already staggering deficit will
be added to if the Mines Department in-
cludes the prospecting and development of
these ore deposits among its activities.
“O.B.”: The finding of some gold nuggets
at the Bulong (W.A.) alluvial patch the
other day reminds me of a day and night
I spent there in ’95. It was then known
as the 1.0. U. Everybody held, or reckoned
they held, interests in bonanzas, and ad-
vanced their selling-price by hundreds of
pounds every hour. Men who were previ-
ously content with tea and coffee wanted
fizz with every meal, and plenty had it. Allu-
vial rushes were plentiful, and storekeepers
were coining money by selling their goods to
departing diggers, and the pubs were never
shut. Here are a few quotations: Boots,
£4 a pair; flour, £25 per 501 b. bag; water,
2s. 6d. per gallon; tinned dog, 2s. 6d. a
tin; sieves and dishes, from 10s. to £1;
chaff, £3 a bag. At the time of my visit
over IOOOoz. were being dry-blown daily, and
the total alluvial output from the field must
have run into 30,0000 z. or more. The small
surrounding centres were never much, and
soon became deserted.
* * * *
Biplane, Harrietville (Vic.), is still
battling. Work is stopped in the 100 ft. and
156 ft. levels, while at 240 ft. an effort has
been made to get air and to follow up the
shoot of gold by rising. Not much of the
precious metal was found, for the shoot of
gold is pitching north, which means a further
hunt. The big job has been to extend the
440 ft. tunnels to intersect the reef at depth.
The reef was cut when the adit had reached
758 ft., and was small (2|ft. wide), and the
shoot short. Manager Carroll sums the for-
mation up as the top of a new make, but
water is too heavy underfoot for winzing,
and the reef too small to take risks. He
went back to 605 ft. to open out on a soft
lode-formation, which shows lOin. to 2ft.
of mineralised stuff in the face. As a trial,
he put 235 tons from the 240 ft. level through
the battery and got 950 z. gold. Carroll’s
objective now is to link up with the 315 ft.
workings so as to proceed with stoping as
well as to find out how values shape between
the two points.
New Blue, Bendigo, had the excellent re-
turn last week of 5500 z. from 700 loads, and
a div. of Is. was declared, being the second
for November. These divs., of course, have
not been wholly won from current produc-
tion, as the co.’s financial position was
strengthened during the week by 2s. 6d. per
oz. premium from the Gold Producers’ Asso-
ciation.
# * * *
The Premier, South Kyneton (Vic.), has
crushed nine tons for 200 oz. gold, making the
return since January last (when the mine
was re-opened) 6840 z. from 39 tons, an aver-
age of about 171 oz. The sole proprietor is
W. Eden, and the production—about £2BOO
worth —is from the work of one pick.
The Sunbeam lease, on the north-west
extension of the Mt. Coolon (Q.) lode, and
adjoining Barclay’s, where the lode looks
well, has been turned down by C. H. Wray,
engineer for an option syndicate. The lode
has been traced underground for eight
chains on this lease, and the size to a depth
around 100 ft. has been fairly satisfactory,
varying from 2ft. to 7ft. or Bft. Values are
on the low side: one or two cuts assayed a
couple of ounces, but the majority were low
and would average well under lOdwt. In
Barclay’s, the average is about loz. The
Sunbeam portion is not big enough on pre-
sent evidence to make 7dwt. pay. But it
will probably not be turned down by the
owners on work done only to 100 ft. Sinking
on Barclay’s will have an important bearing
on prospects lower down.

Blair. Athol coal (Q.), after making a
notable recovery in production to the 12,000-
ton mark, drifted back in October to between
0000 and 7000 tons. Most of the decline
can be attributed to increased output at
Mt. Morgan’s Dawson Valley colliery, at
Baralaba, as well as to the competition of
the State coal-mine at Bowen, whose out-
put is now up to 170 tons a day, and is, of
course, supplying Townsville as well as the
northern railways. The Bowen Consolidated
will be competing with the State mine in
the course' of a few weeks. The mine is
opening up, and now only needs the rails
to its pithead to start coal-raising.
• • * *
Tyrconnel’s (N.Q.) last crushing was well
above the average: 158 oz. smelted gold and
a ton of concentrates from 120 tons ore.
The cO. is short of water for the mill owing
to the long dry spell. As reserves about
No. 5 are petering out, the mainshaft is
being deepened.

Th 4 B. H. Prop, still has an eye on
Blythe River iron. It paid £llOO for an
optioi over that busted show, has fulfilled
the terms of the option, but has so far not
given any hint of its intentions to Wm.
Jamieson’s old co. It made a loss of £504
last year, £3OO representing Board fees.

J. Malcolm Newman discusses Papuan
gold:—
A decade has passed since the last attempt of
Pitt- and Collins-street miners to get a clean-up from
the Jungle Alluvial Mines Unlimited- of New Guinea,
and it is but natural that the old ground should be
worked over again.
As one who bore the brunt of disillusioning the
public on a previous occasion, I should like to
repeat my former words: “Sufficient testing has not
been done by anyone to prove the existence of pay-
able alluvial on the Yodda.” I have the greatest
admiration for those wonderful pioneers, Mat Crowe,
Arthur Darling, Elliott, Chessher and the others, and
would say that what they don’t know about discover-
ing and working alluvial is not worth knowing.
But the stubborn fact is that they are not mine
valuers, and when Mat Crowe pins his faith to
hydraulic sluicing (B. 16/11/’22) he shows he is not
a treatment man either.
The flats between the Mambare River and lioko
Creek, and, indeed, all the alluvial on the Yodda,
consists, I should say, of 90 p.c. stones larger than
one’s head, and there is only one way of working
such land—by bucket-dredging. It is unfortunate
that the ground is unsuitable for hydraulic sluicing
or gravel-pumping, as there is a wonderful chance of
securing useful water for nozzling and hydraulic ele-
vation. By the bucket-dredge method of working
this water could only be utilised after converting its
energy to electricity, and no doubt this aspect of the
question should be carefully examined, particularly
as, in my opinion, the sort of dredge required to
work the Yodda would entail a first cost of £40,000
f.o.b. Australia. I would not undertake to start
bucket-dredging on the Yodda without a cash
balance in the bank of £lOO,OOO.
I do not say that the Yodda, and other fields,
are unpayable. I say that the valuation of them
should be undertaken by a highly-experienced tech-
nical mining-engineer with proper staff and equip-
ment, and I cannot see it being done as it should
be done for much less than £lO,OOO.
The fact that the rainfall is 300 in. per annum
largely accounts for the physical conditions of the
“wash” in this part of New Guinea, and also is the
explanation of my opinion as to the expensiveness of
the development and equipment of properties in this
area. Camped at Jack Chessher’s ranch on the
Yodda several hundred yards from the Mambare, in
the middle of the night, after a heavy storm, l
have heard the report of rocks dashed against each
other in the river like pistol-shots a few yards
away.
New Guinea requires tackling by men of experi-
ence, backed by scientific knowledge and lots of
cash. Under such guidance I would give the Yodda
a chance, as well as the Warria, Gira, Lakekamu and,
perhaps, Milne Bay, and some small propositions on
Woodlark, the Sinkurai, for example. I do not
expect any of these valleys to be very rich, certainly
not more than 6d. to Is. per yd., owing to the
climatic conditions. In the Mambare I have seen
more flattened gold than any other variety, and I
believe that the flow of the waters is so strong
that in many places there is as much gold on the
top of the beaches as on the bottom. Still, there are
vast millions of yards, and, working on a large
scale with electric power, costs would be very low.
The conditions could be made quite as good as in
Malaya, say, and that means a jolly sight better
than in many outback Australian mining fields.

“and it's printed with WIMBLE'S INKS
“Bonita”: Re “T.R.H.” on English dia-

authority. As they passed

“Us bain’t agoin’ ter be

“Clinker Knocker” on some callous naval

When the H.M.A.S. Geranium left Sydney, in
June, for survey service in the northern waters of
Australia, Authority, in the shape of the quarter-
deck, refused the Sydney Sun information regarding
her movements. It had no option in the matter
under the regulations. Not realising this', perhaps,
the Sun made some ill-timed remarks about the
Geranium’s remissness in not looking for the lost
Manurewa and the futility of warships sweeping the
mines at Broken Hill, which gibes Billjack resented.
On the return of the Geranium the other day a Sun
reporter went aboard for information, which was again
refused by Authority; but, not to be beaten, the
scoop-seeker got hold of Billjack and Billjack held
forth on the horrors of the voyage. Among other
things he told of how the crew had been
attacked by thousands of niggers in the dense
jungle on Night Island; and there were, also some
gory incidents, in which niggers fought sharks there
—one dusky prince swam out two miles through
shoals of man-eaters, and ripped one nearly in two
with a bone knife. It all duly appeared, with
literary embellishments. The densely-jungled Night
Island is about half-an-acre of coral off the Barrier
Reef, and there are as many niggers surf-bath-
ing with the sharks there as there are breakers
at Booligal. Taking things for all in all, the
Geranium reckons it is at least one up on the
SUN, so far.

“Kip” : Re “Tren” (B. 16/11/’22) on the
use of that consoling and condoling word
“Maleish,” signifying “It doesn’t matter.”
This Gyppo expression was almost forgotten
by the Diggers once they were ensconced in
the mud of France. The Frenchman’s equiva-
lent for “Maleish” is “Ce ne fait rien”; he
does not employ it quite so freely, but it
occurred often enough in the every-day speech
of the estaminet and billet for the Diggers
to catch the spirit of it. “Ce ne fait rien,”
however, was a bit too much of a tongue-
twister, and was Australianised into “Send
for Mary Ann.” In endeavoring to school
a cobber of mine, step by step, into the
exact pronunciation of the phrase, my
efforts met with this setback: “Maleish!
‘Send for Mary Ann’ ’s good enough for me.
What’s the odds so long as a man’s under-
stood?”

“Dido” : There was a commotion in that
eminently respectable residential, Th e
Byronic. Miss Towers had reported to Mrs.
Glover. Mrs. Glover had carried the matter
to Mrs. Green and the Rev. William Green,
aid now a moral management was thun-
dering at Orpin’s door, demanding admis-
sion in the name of the Daw and the pro-
phets, and declaring that Orpin, in bringing
a woman into his rooms, had broken every
rule and covenant, and was liable to instant
ejectment with ail his goods and accoutre-
ments. When the door opened, Orpin con-
fronted his accusers in a state of fiery indig-
nation, and offered to fight the management
and the Rev. William all together or one
down, the other come on. At the
instance of the aspersed lodger the
rooms were searched. Not a corner was
left unexplored—the Rev. William saw to
that. The management was about to retire
in contrition and penitence, and was already
framing its apologies, when the yardman
arrived to declare that a woman was hang-
ing out in the night from one of the back-
window ledges, bo was lost to Orpin all
the advantage of being mashed on one of
the most eminent trapeze artists in the pro-
fession, and he left The Byronic that night
in an atmosphere of bitterness and con-
straint. So did the lady.

“Kay”: Most of the Eight Ilorse regi-
ments in Sinai and Palestine had Gyppo in-
terpreters, or “interrupters,” as they were
genially christened. As a rule, they had
a good command of Arabic, and a
small knowledge of English. Our linguist
was one Sardi, and, after six months ser-
vice, be was granted two weeks’ leave to
visit his family in Cairo. There was no
Sardi when the fortnight expired, but about
a week later one of the staff at Kantara for-
warded the following to the 0.C.:

“Bilbav” takes a look back: —
Compulsory military training must have slippeC
considerably in the last few years if it has become as
described by “Clauswitz” and others. When I was
absorbing it, in a company of public-school youths,
the preliminary business of calling the roll, drawing
rifles, inspection, etc., was far more promptly and
efficiently done than I have since seen in any active-
service unit, A.I.F. or Imperial. We then marched
to the Domain, and the training there was training,
not horseplay. We were never dismissed till the
full time of parade had been done, except once or
twice in wet weather. And there was unfailing
overtime for defaulters and malingerers. It made
for discipline, no doubt, that the company was
staffed by schoolmasters, most of whom had held
commissions before, that the senior n.c.o.’s were
largely prefects and the R.S.M. a bluff old ex-
Tommy. In addition, there was always a keen spirit
of rivalry between platoons, and consequently a fine
esprit de corps among the whole company. Are
all these accessories gone, nowadays?
HIS DELUSION.
“Be careful; you will never get another husband like me!”
“What on earth makes you think I’d want another like you?”

Free verse should not he free. It should be sub-
ject to a doggerel tax.
The church, ever begging for a little money, natu-
rally gets all the thrippences.
In every house where the gas is laid on there is
proof of the triumph of meter over mind.
According to the W.C.T.U. this country is alive
with smoking ruins.

“Lip”: This was the story the jobbing
gardener told me as he downed shears pre-
paratory to having a spell:—
“You’ve got to be pretty fly to git a job these
days, I can tell yer. There’s so many out-o’-works
about it’s a matter o’ gettin’ there bright an’ early,
and even then there’s always blokes as ’ll try to
beat yer for yer possie to git first to the boss’s ear.
A couple o’ days ago that big place up the road
there wanted a man for gardenin’. The advert, said
7 a.m., an’ I’m there waitin’ for the hour to come
round because I reckon it’s a good thing to let etn
see yer pun’tual th’ first day, even if yer don t keep
it up. Well, I’m holdin’ up th’ gate when along
comes a bloke an’ tries to shove in past me. ‘ ’Ere,’
I says, ‘what’s yer game? The advert, says seven,
don’t it?’ ’E says it did. ‘Well,’ says I, ‘what’s yer
hurry? Just you git be’ind in th’ kwee an’ you’ll
be next after me.’ ’E seemed a bit annoyed at that,
an’ says to me, pretty sharp, ‘An’ oo th’ devil are
you?’ ‘Me?’ I says, ‘l’m th’ bloke that’s goin’ to
’ave first say with th’ boss about gittin’ this ’ere
job.’ ‘Oh, are yer?’ says ’e; ‘well, I might tell yer
that I’m th’ boss.’ Now, if I’d been a bit greener
I’d ’a’ bit. But y’ see I know a thing or two. A
little while ago a mob of us was waitin’ on a job
when a bloke rushes up to the gate an’ says ’e’s th’
cook’s ’usban’ an’ wants to tell ’er th’ baby’s sick,
an’ we lets ’im go in ahead, an’ blarst me when we
all goes in on th’ tick o’ time if e’ ain’t started on
th’ job already. So y’ see the old bloke’s tale don’t
go down. ‘Yer the boss, are yer?’ I says sarcastic
like, ‘an’ y’ll be the owner of th’ shanty, too, I
s’pose?” ’E says ’e was. Gorstruth! that was a
rough un to put up on a man. Why, all ’e wanted
was a pair o’ bowyangs an’ ’e’d ’a been dressed for
a sewerin’ job. ‘I believe yer ?’ I says, smilin j
‘but yer after me in this ’ere gate all the same.’ ’E
comes with a rush to jostle me an’ I trips ’im. ’E
up an’ lands me a woodener in th’ ribs an’ I fits ’im
with one in the eye; over we goes together, first
massagin’ the footpath, then rubbin’ th’ paint off th’
fence. Then the women in the house comes rushin’
out squealin’ ‘Murder!’ an’ ‘Police!’ an’ I shakes
’im off an’ fades away, because I reckoned I’d
crooled me chance o’ the job boxin -on outside their
gate. But it’ll just show yer what a bloke is up
against when he’s lookin for a job these days.
I didn’t tell him that the owner of the “big
place up the road” was Bullen, _an ex-
squatter, whose Tyson-like simplicity of
attire exactly tallied with the jobber’s de-
scription of his truculent fellow-Peri at the
gate. I was too grateful for his uncon-
sciously-provided explanation of why Bullen
has been wearing a new suit and a black
eye these last few days.
Boyd Cable on a famous old craft: —
You’ll probably have had the news that the old
Cutty Sark has been bought by a Falmouth owner (he
got her, I hear, for a bit over £3000), and is to be
restored to her old full rig, and finish her career as
a training-ship. I saw her many years ago in
Sydney Harbor, her beautiful lines catching my eye
by chance and leaving me
to clamber aboard and
investigate. I wrote an
article about her in a
Liverpool paper after I
came from Aus. (in early
1914, I think), and soon
after the old elipper hap-
pened to wander into
Liverpool. I sent some
articles out to Australia
then, and in them I urged
that one or more Aussies
ought to buy her and make
her a training-ship, or,
say, the flagship of the
Sydney Yacht Club. I’ve
heard of her at various
times since, and when she
blew into London river
a few months ago I went
and had a look over her,
and was brokenhearted to
see the state she was in.
1 got in touch with Sir
Walter Runciman, and im-
plored him to buy her,
and he was sufficiently
interested to come down
with me to the docks and
look all over her. How-
ever, he was up to the ears
shortly after in some new
shipping scheme, and
Cutty Sark sailed again,
still a Portugoose. I’m
glad she is British again,
but I still have a regret
that she wasn’t bought by
an Australian, and that she
won’t finish her career in
one of the ports to which
she made some of her most
famous runs in her record-
breaking days. She is,
1 fancy, the very last of
the old-time clipper ships,
and there must be in
Australia to-day many (les-
cendants of the thousands of emigrants she carried
out in the days when her comings and goings set the
bunting flying and the bands playing, and created
much more to-do than even the record passages of
the crack steamer racers do to-day.

“T. 0.1.”: Canberra House, on the north
corner of Elizabeth and Liverpool streets,
Sydney, has been sold for “about £65,000.
The site in the ’thirties was the home of
Mrs. Mary Reibey. Later, Mrs. Cousins kept
a school for young ladies in the old “Reibey”
house. In the early ’seventies Dr. Renwick
purchased the property and built Clarendon-
terrace upon it. The doctor was one of
those who believed Mary Reibey to be the
versatile Margaret Catchpole.

“Bullwhanger”: The Port Jackson boat-
load that I saw just before the southerly
came along had the necessary liquid cargo,
both barrelled and bottled, for a glorious
beano. Later in the day I struck the same
crew on a beach. They had been capsized, but
wet as they were externally, it was clear
that they were wetter within. I was won-
dering how they had done it—the nearest
pub being a couple of miles away and shut—
IDENTIFIED.
“Waiter! There's a fly in my soup!”
“Good Lord! Is that where it’s got to? I
noticed we were one short in the cur-
rant-cake.”
when I saw two barrels securely life-jacketed.
Then it became as clear as daylight. The
jovial souls had accorded the bottled stuff
that treatment which, in mixed company, is
the privilege of women and children.

WHEN AUNTY ANNE A-RIDING WENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Once Aunty Anne was light and fair,
A paragon of modesty;
And when she would a-riding go
She dressed herself becomingly.
Her coat was buttoned to the neck,
Her habit was a flowing gown
With wads of lead around the hem
To straighten it and keep it down.
Her hair was tightly coiled and knobbed
Beneath a hat of sombre hue ;
She wore a veil that she might blush
Unseen by people that she knew.
Straight-hacked and stiff, she sat erect—■
Of course, she did not sit astride—
For women were so different in
The days when Aunty used to ride.
A cameo was at her throat,
The craftsmanship of olden years;
A locket dangled from a chain,
And two drop pearls hung from her ears.
Her handkerchief and smelling-salts
Were in a pouch swung at her side;
And silken mittens clothed her hands,
When Aunty Anne went for a ride.
We used to lift her to the horse;
And, as she settled in her seat,
We’d stretch and pull the habit-skirt
Till it hung well below her feet.
She’d kick it out and shake it down
And straighten out the folds in doubt;
For Aunty thought it would be wrong
Should one small toe come peeping out.
Her saddle was a wondrous thing
Of quilted seat and wooden tree,
With two great curving horns in front,
Where Aunty used to swing her knee.
The head-stall band was blue and white—■
The eye no Barcoo bridle caught—
And folded buckskin were the reins,
The polished snaffle richly wrought.
An escort always went with her
To help her down should she alight;
And, though Aunt knew her way abour,
To ride alone would not be right.
And there were times a whiskered youth
To go with her was well content,
And put the sliprails up and down
When Aunty Anne a-riding went.

THE WATCHERS.


HUMILITY.
[Fo« The Bulletin.]
For noble heart, and nature meek,
Commend me to the man, I saj,
Who wears upon his coat this week
The badge of last week's button day !
PARAGOT.
“Iford”: “Wilfrido” (B. 2/11/’22) nom-
inates the court-room as the most fruitful
field for malapropisms. I submit, as an
amendment, any place where and
stable-lads congregate. On this prolific sub
iect Rand wick circles almost alwaysi have a
“newev” lor the stranger s delectation. Lhe
latest concerns Dick Dillyboy s apologia
when the trainer rated him for letting an
outsider get so far ahead early in the race.
Dick pleaded in extenuation that he had
been told to look out for the favorite, and
his attention was constipated on that ani-
mal. It was Dick, too, who was heard
decrying, not the horsemanship, but the voca-
bulary of another prad-steerer who was
addicted to recalling Der Tag when he “rode
three winners in concession.” “Hie silly
coot —someone ought to buy him a shilling
dictionary. Of course, he means concus-
sion,” was Richard’s comment.
* * * *
“Pat Bushie” presents a new type of men-
dicant : •
His imperative rap on the front door brought me
out. “ 'Owerbout somethin’ t’eat?’’ he inquired trucu-
lently. He was dressed in a well-worn, badly-mended
pair of trousers, new kid boots and a frock-coat four
sizes too big. “An’ 1 wants four boh,” he told me.
“1 wants t’ put a bit more outer me tent.” “Y\h.\
don’t you work for it?” I asked, glancing towards the
woodheap. “WORK!” lie roared. “Work! When
there’s people wot’ll gimme tucker, clothes an
money 1 “WORK! When I’m makin’ a decen’
livin’ doin’ nothin’. Wot d’yer take me for?
“Did you ever work?” I asked. “On’y w’en I was
in gaol. An’ wot’s more, I’ll never
well work again.” He spat in a' scornful
manner. “I travels round and can always
git tucker, clothes an’ money—there’s plenty
o’ fools wot’ll ’elp me! You earn money
an’ pay (axes, but yer no better’n me. Millionaires,
too! Wiv all their money they can on’y ’ave a
feed same as me 1 Come on, cough up that four bob,
an’ dig out some seran. I’m in a ’urry, an’ ’ave no
time t’ talk !” My name was added to the long list
of fools.
* * * *
“Tin Hat”: The queer law that debars
the illegitimate as filius nullius from possess-
ing any next-of-kin, except it be a wife or
family of his own, cropped up in Vic. the
other" day. A Melbourne man died practi-
cally intestate (his only will was in favor
of an uncle who had predeceased him), and
the estate was claimed by the deceased man’s
sister’s children. It was also claimed by
the dead man’s solicitor, the latter contend-
ing that his client, being of illegitimate birth,
the estate should be his by virtue of his ap-
SATTATED.
“Can I be of use to you, madam?”
“No thank yer, young feller; fre just
bought a nornament”
pointment as executor. Although the dead
man’s parents had married after his birth
and raised a family, the judgment of Justice
Macfarlane is that none of these can legally
claim kinship with their brother, and that
the executor is merely holding the estate in
trust. The result is that the Crown scoops
the lot.
“Bah”: Jones Hopped heavily into the seat
beside me as the suburban drew out from the
station. He had the air of a man whose
cup of bitterness was full. “I’ll tell you
how it is,” he volunteered in response to my
sympathetic inquiry. “Last Saturday I
went down to the baths. It was mixed-bath-
ing dav. you know. Somebody introduced me
to a shapely sort of flapper, and pretty soon
I found myself teaching her how to float and
WITH PLEASURE.
“ Horace , will you meet mother at the station to-night and show
her the way home?”
“There's wothin' I'd like more. Where does she live note?"
so forth. You know how friendly you soon
get with anyone in the baths.. Well, last
Wednesday I was taking the wife into town
when who should get into our tram but my
mixed-bathing acquaintance. I raised my
hat, of course, but she didn’t take any notice
of me. The wife did, though. She gave me
the peculiar glare that means, ‘Up. to your
old games again, eh?’ Well, I sat tight, but
pretty soon the girl’s face lit up with recog-
nition, and, leaning forward, she gave me a
playful lick on the knee with her glove. ‘Oh,
Mister Jones,’ she gushed, ‘really, I didn’t
recognise you with your clothes on!’ ”
• * • *
“Nollig”: The last Court of Petty Ses-
sions at Bothwell (Tas.) was illumined by
the following ray of sunshine: “Being as I
can’t attend the court to answer a charge of
cow-straying, I plead guilty ; but I can’t
see any serious damage done. The boys
were down with me, and the cow did not
come home, as usual, before dark, and went
past, and like all offenders, fell into the
hands of the police,
Who done their level best
To land her in the jail,
And when the cow saw what was up
She turned around her tail;
And then she made a line for home,
A chance they couldn’t miss;
If she had led them somewhere else
I’d not be writing this.
If yon send to my house the fine will be
promptly paid.”
* * * *
“Bogan Bill”: Was in an Outback pub
one recent hot day when a dusty swaggie
invaded the bar, put his money carefully on
the counter and called for two long beers.
He absorbed them in two successive
draughts. Then, turning to the publican, he
remarked, “Gripes, but beer’s good!” Bung
only grunted a non-committal reply, and this
apparently aroused the other’s worst suspi-
cions. “Hey.” ho demanded tensely, that
teas beer vou guv me, wasn’t it?”
• * * *
“Faudli” : I used to think the expression.
“Flag the booze!” was derived from railroad
practice. But in the Maoriland wet-dry con-
troversy national Hags are being largely util-
ised on the posters. First, the Stars and
Stripes were displayed in contrast to the
Union Jack, as symbolising the long list
of evils likely to result from a surrender
to the devotees of Drought. Someone
objected. Perhaps the potent Pussyfoot
threatened to treat the matter as a casus
belli. Anyhow’, the symbol suddenly dis-
appeared as a means of propaganda, and
Kemal Pasha came to the rescue. Now the
Crescent of teetotal Islam gives gaudy color
to an additional list of contrasts. There
are not wanting indignant objectors, within
the fold this time, and without a doubt
someone w’ill yet convince the authorities that
the ulterior intent of the Moderate party is
to insult the fame of Anzac.
“Yardley”: The
smart business, of
an American firm
in buying the rights
of an inventor, con-
tracting for pay-
ment upon a roy-
alty basis, and then
holding the patent
up indefinitely is
an old dodge in a
new dress. I n
England, thousands
of inventions are
purchased and
pigeonholed. A man
has £IO,GUO worth
of machinery pro-
ducing an article
of general demand;
an inventor shows
a design that w;ill
scrap the entire
plant of the fac-
tory. The position
stands that the
manufacturer may
disburse a thou-
sand for the de-
sign, or he may lose
ten thousand in
scrapped machin-
ery. He chooses
the lesser loss, buys
the invention and
keeps it off the
market. My brother
went to London
w’ith an invention
in which he hoped
to interest jewel-
lers. The first man
interviewed w’as a
leading retailer of
Hatton Garden.
“Very clever, very
good,” lie praised.
“What will you
take to shut it up?
You may put my
name down for 20
sovereigns.” I n
Australia there are
five million persons,,
and about half-a-
dozen of them have seen back the money
spent upon patents. *
“7PN” takes the unpopular view: —
Apropos “National Fighting Qualities” (B.
23/11/’22), I walk straight out into the open and
aver that the palm in the scrapping line, during
the late war, should be handed to the Hun machine-
gunners. Whereas the English fell back 36 miles in
five days from the Cambrai-St. Quentin front, offer-
ing but the weakest resistance, the Hun at his worst
never approached that pace. Beaten, disconsolate,
exhausted beyond measure and scourged by terrific
shell-fire, the rate of retirement of the German
armies towards the end never exceeded three miles
a day, and in most eases it was less, occasionally
getting down to lialf-a-mile. Their rear-guard
actions left little to be desired. One or two were
epics. Death and anguish were everywhere and
their battalions were fast slipping into the abyss ; yet
there was never a time, right up to the hour when
the Armistice ended the carnage, that the German
machine-gunners were unable to turn and, in the
last agony ere death came upon them, chop Hell out
of their pursuing enemies. I was one of 'em, so
I know.
“F.A.”: The Arab was an enthusiastic
believer in secret commissions. When with the
Aussie Artillery at Zaharieh camp, near
Alexandria, I had to order bersene (green
fodder) for the horses. After making in-
quiries from the vendors who hung about the
camp, I gave one an order for five loads a

ous future, dealt girl.”

to go on with?”
day, to be continued so long as the stuff
was satisfactory. That night, when placing
my wallet under my pillow, I found two 00-
piastre notes there. The same thing hap-
pened next night. On the third day, when
looking round the lines, I heard a commo-
tion coming from the direction of my tent,
and looked round in time to see my bat-
man’s boot make contact with the hinder
end of a native. On inquiring, I found that
Mahomet had been caught as he was fur-
tively slinking out of the tent. The two
notes were under the pillow as before,
although the native (who was the bersene
merchant’s offsider) denied all knowledge of
them. I detailed the incident to the camp
commandant, who commanded the Warwick-
shire Yeomanry, and asked him what I
should do with the money. “Liquidate your
drivers’ thirst with it. They sell Tennants’
beer in the village,” was his advice.

“Pro” on a languishing industry:—
It is not necessary for “Deacon” and “Cutter” (B.
2/11/’22) to import grog-running devices from the
U.S. or M.L.—anyone with a nose can smell
them on our own maritime doorstep. Broken Bay
(N.S.W.) was, until the tourists discovered it, the
paradise of illicit distillers. The juice was landed
openly on the Sydney wharves in kerosene tins
labelled as bush honey, along with tins that ditl
contain the product of the bees’ labor. When the
Customs Department got fly, it insisted upon a soft
metal disc being soldered into the lids, so that they
could be prodded by an investigatory skewer. The
moonshiners countered this by a long narrow
cylinder under the disc, inside the tin, which they
filled with honey. There was also a great trade in
firewood from these parts, and many of the logs were
but alcoholised sepulchres. The Customs officer at
Barranjoey once smelt out a hogshead of the contra-
band buried in the sand at Mackerel Beach, Pitt-
water. However, the hillmen stove the cask, and
thus destroyed all evidence by allowing it to rw into
the bay. It was such dinkum stuff, so local tradi-
tion hath it, that the periwinkles came out of their
shells, and even the oysters became chatty.

The Ulster Association of Sydney, which
had its 18th annual shivoo recently, was,
when founded by tbe late W. T. Waters,
of “The Corner,” purely a social club, one
rule being that politics and religious ques-
tions were to be left on the doormat. Nowa-
days the Premier is invited, and the Gover-
nor, if agreeable, makes a speech. Sir Walter
Davidson, who comes from Killeleagh (Co.
Down), which is noted chiefly for its bog,
is the third Ulsterman to occupy N.S.W.
Government House. Sir John Young and
Earl Belmore were the other two.
THE HENRY LAWSON
MEMORIAL.
We have received the following:—
Town Hall, Sydney,
3/11/1922.
The Editor “The Bulletin,” Sydney.
Dear Sir, —At the last meeting of the
Executive Committee of the Henry Law-
son Memorial Fund it was decided that
the memorial should take the form of a
statue, and if sufficient funds are avail-
able also to provide a scholarship at the
Sydney University.
It was resolved that the Lord Mayor
should open a fund, that the press be
asked to open their columns for sub-
scriptions, and that “The Bulletin” be
asked to open a special “Bulletin” Henry
Lawson Fund, owing to that paper’s
association with Henry Lawson’s work,
and its unique circulation.
In pursuance of this resolution, the
Lord Mayor desires me to ask if you can
see your way to open a subscription
list in your columns. The Lord Mayor
feels that your help in this direction
will materially assist the fund, and will
be highly appreciated by the Executive
Committee.
Yours faithfully,
\V. G. LAYTON,
Joint hon. sec. Henry Lawson Memorial
Fund.
Contributions should be addressed to The
Bulletin Office, Sydney, and endorsed
“Henry Lawson Memorial.”

PERSONAL ITEMS
Austin Brereton (the biographer of the
Irvings—father and sons), who died at
Athens a few days ago, was formerly well
known in Sydney. He acted as the S. M.
Herald’s dramatic critic during 18S9-91.
Brereton married an actress, the tall, blonde
Edith Blande, who likewise is remembered
in these parts.
“Splinter”: A medical partnership of four,
including Earle Page, M.H.R., all enlisted
for the Big Scrap and went overseas. It
sounds like a world’s record to me. Inci-
dentally, two of them picked up decorations;
and a brother of Page, not in the partner-
ship, collected a D.S.O. and M.C. as well.
A.. D. W. Allen, the ex-flying man, who
has just become a N.S.W. solicitor, is the
fourth generation of his family to chase
Costs. His great-grandfather, George Allen,
was admitted to practice in 1822—the first
Australian student to be let in, and the third
“free” man then in the profession. The
lower branch did all the business until W.
C. Wentworth and Robert Wardell, barris-
ters, came in 1824.
C. E. Weigall, a Crown prosecutor, becomes
N.S.W. Solicitor-General without emolument
or Ministerial rank. Before Responsible
Government the offices of Attorney-General
and Solicitor-General, both Imperial appoint-
ments, were devoted mainly to the criminal
business of the country, but after 1856 they
were political, and remained so until Nov.,
1873, when the Solicitor-General, J. G. L.
Innes, became Attorney-General on the resig-
nation of Butters, and G. W. Allen became
Minister of Justice and Public Instruction.
George Reid revived
the office in his oAvn
person for technical
purposes in Dec., 1894,
and on six or seven
occasions afterwards.
The Wade Govern-
ment united the office
to that of Minister for
Justice in John Gar-
land’s time, as did W.
A. II olman later.
Sproule was the last
of the political Solici-
tors-General, and a
permanent a p p o in t-
ment was made a few
years ago, when Pol-
lock, for official rea-
sons, held the job.
REYNOLDS
DRIVER, the saw-
miller, who is claim-
ing £192,000 from the
War Service Homes
Commissioner.
“Marminga”: Dr. Peter Lalor (B.
23/11/’22), superintendent of the hospital
for the insane, at Sunbury (Vic.), is the
grandson and not the son of the original
Peter, of the Eureka Stockade, and later
Speaker of the Vic. Assembly. Joseph Lalor
(young Peter’s father) practised as a doctor
for many years in a large mansion in
Church-street, Richmond, where old Peter
died in ISB9.
“T. 0.1.” : Re “W.G.S.’s” par. (8.23/11/’22)
about his daughter’s long list of Australian
ancestors. Anthony Rope came in the First
Fleet, and he was the only one of that name.
If “W.G.S.” is relying upon Toby Ryan (his
great-grandfather) as an authority, he will
be leaning upon a weak stick. Toby, in his
volume of “Reminiscences,” opens with :
My grandfather and grandmother arrived with the
First fleet in 1788, their son, Robert, being the
first white male child born in Australia. He was
born in the Soldiers’ Barracks, Wynyard Square,
nine months and ten days after the arrival of the
First Fleet.
There were no such barracks, nor was there
any such square at the time named. The
first parson, Richard Johnson, within a
month of landing, married several couples,
and doubtless Anthony Rope was among
them.
“A.L.E.”: “Bullwhanger” (B. 16/11/’22)
made an error in naming the smallest man
in the British army. He was certainly
called “Doe,” but his surname was Wittman,
and he is more readily known as “Twit”
among old public-school boys of Victoria,
lie was cox of the YV esley College crew for
many years. His total height, boots and all
is 4ft. Gin.
“Paudh”: The new-old nation which
stamps its name (for postage purposes)
across the King’s face-print as “Rialtar
Sealadac nah Eireann, 1922,” lias a way of
its own with the po-lis. Ex M.L. Police
Commissioner Shaun O’Donovan, who re-
tired last year, set out for his native Cork a
tew months back. He received a warm
greeting from the John Hops of London on
the way, but all that Erin offered him was a
peremptory 48 hours’ notice to get out. He
is now returning in a disillusioned frame
of mind to resume his M.L. nationality.
Shaun was a nephew of O’Donovan Rossa
and some sort of
relation to Mick
Collins. On the
other hand he ac-
companied Edward
of Wales through
the Shaky Isles in
the capacity of Bol-
shevik discourager,
and was photo-
graphed in friendly
confab with the
young man. His
most heinous
offence in the eyes
of the pathriots of
Erin is that he
‘‘kept in” with all
factions in M.L.

audiences.
■ kwenula : During his 40 years in the
N.S.W. police force ex-Superintendent J.
Atkinson held every regular rank from pro-
bationary constable to acting-inspector
General, and also one irregular rank—that
of Sergeant-Major, which was specially cre-
ated for him in connection with the visit of
the present King and Queen in 1901. Only
one other man has ever held that rank in the
N.S.W. force, and he held no other. He was
one Thomson, a sergeant-major in the Brit-
ish regular army, who was imported in the
middle of last century as drill instructor to
the mounted police.
The talk of. T. H. Nesbitt resigning the
Town Clerkship of Sydney in 1923 after
22 years of it, recalls that the first Town
Clerk, appointed in 1842, was C. H. Cham-
bers, a solicitor, who retired after eight
months’ service, to be succeeded by John
liae, a Master of Arts of a Scots ’Varsity,
who held the job for 10 years and became
one of three commissioners appointed during
a three years’ suspension of municipal, or
aldermanic, government. On a new Cor-
poration Act coming into force in 1857, Rae
became secretary and eventually Commis-
sioner for Railways. C. 11. Woolcott, an
employee of the Council from the start,
was appointed Town Clerk under the new
regime, and had 30 years of it. H. J.
Daniels followed, and held on for 104 years,
being succeeded by John R. Palmer, who
resigned after 14 months. R. M. McC. An-
derson came next in Nov. 1899, and January,
1901, saw the end of his reign. After world-
wide applications had been invited Ellery,
of Adelaide (and later of Melbourne), was
selected, but he jibbed, and the next on the
list, Nesbitt, wbo was then City Comptroller
of Westminster, was sent for.
“Pick”: At Bungendore (N.S.W.), the
other day, Tom Cavanough went out at
83. When in charge of the station at
Peat’s Ferry, in the early ’eighties, he
held down the points to swerve into a
dead-end a . runaway train which was
making straight for a packed passenger
train standing on the bridge. Cavanough,
who took his chance of being crushed under
overturning waggons to avert an appalling
disaster, got little reward and no promotion
for it.
There was grief in the Vic. State depart-
ments when Tim Littleton, the Premier’s
orderly, passed out. A ginger-beer cart col-
lided with him when he was cycling, and
the shaft penetrated his chest. Littleton
had qualities that specially fitted him for a
difficult job, and was the best-known man
in the service. A privileged person, whose
discretion was trusted, he could say what
he liked to Ministers and was heeded, be-
cause his shrewdness and fealty had so often
been proved.
Dead at 74, Dugald Thomson, formerly
prominent in N.S.W. and Federal politics.
He was elected for Warringah in the State
House in 1894 and for North Sydney in
the lieps. in 1901, 1903 and 1906. George
Reid included him in his Ministerial team
1904-05. Thomson began his business career
in Australia with Robert Harper and Co.
in Melbourne, and in 1877 he opened their
Sydney business as managing partner. He
retired two or three decades ago, and died
a bachelor.
4i 8.”: Little Jack Price, S. Aus. Labor
M.P. and son of the late Labor-leader Tom
Price, threatened to punch big Premier Bar-
well’s nose the other night, but S’Henry
didn’t accept the challenge—to “have it any-
where he liked, on the floor of the House, if
he liked.” Barwell is one of the few lawyers
who has had his eye punched in court. Years
ago in Port l'irie, a steamer captain took
action against half-a-dozen seamen for de-
serting, and Barwell was appearing for him,
when suddenly one of the A.B.’s made a
dive at the skipper and knocked him out. The
other seamen promptly joined in, and Bar-
well attempted to stop one of the aggressors,
but only stopped one on the eye.
“F.A.”: Bland Sutton, who carved up
Rudyard Kipling last week, is still London’s
very best performer with the knife, though
he is within three years of the allotted span.
He did great work during the war, and some
of his operations stand as epics in their line.
The fact that his father, James Sutton, was
a butcher, may have some bearing on his
amazing skill.
E- Burney Young, a S. Australian who
died in England recently, was a grandson
ot Eady Charlotte Bacon and General Bacon,
A*r e youn £ es t officer in Wellington’s army at
Waterloo. His mother (and mother also of
Harry D. Young, M.P. for Murray in the
S. Aus. Parliament) lives in Adelaide. In
liis recently-published “Journalist’s Jottings”
(a book issued for the Flinders statue
fund), Fred Johns gives an interesting
account of Lady Charlotte’s life in S. Aus.
He mentions that five great-grandsons of
Byron s “lanthe” served in the recent war.

Council, moves up into the chairmanship of

the new member of the Board.
ARTHUR BLAKELEY, M.H.R. (Dar-

party, and general president to A.W.U.
“Chancery Lane”: Passed out at 79, Wil-
liam Riggall, about the best-known legal
man in Victoria. A Lancashire native, he
was articled in 1562 to R. W. Nutt, of Mel-
bourne, who subsequently took A. P. Blake
into partnership. When Nutt retired in
1874 Blake and Riggall constituted the firm
which has for so long been practically part
and parcel of Victoria. In his younger days
Riggall played with the Melb. Football
Club, was a noted oarsman, and one of the
earliest players in the East Melbourne
Cricket Club. His wife died in 1915, and two
children only survive him, of whom one,
Lieut.-Col. Harold Riggall, C.M.Q., is a
member of the firm.
Ramsay Macdonald, who beat Clynes for
the leadership of the Labor party in the
House of Commons by a narrow majority,
was in Australia 16 years ago. He spoke at
the special gathering of past and present poli-
ticians in Melbourne on November 21, 1906,
to celebrate the jubilee of the Vic. Parlia-
ment under Responsible Government.
Judge-street, Woolloomooloo, has had its
name changed to McElhone-street, in mem-
ory of John McElhone, the Lord Mayor’s
father. John was a Sydney native who once
represented the locality, both in the Leg.
Assembly and the Municipal Council. As
M.L.A. for Fitzroy, John McElhone, who
died in office, was succeeded by John Norton,
who held the seat (his first Parliamentary
one) for just a month.
“Stellsby”: Capt. Evans, of H.M.S. Car-
lisle, for whom Lloyd’s recently struck a
special medal to commemorate his bravery
in rescuing the passengers and crew of the
Chinese steamer Hong Mali, is our old
friend the Antarctic hero. During the war
Evans distinguished himself as commander
of a T.B.D. on the Dover and Harwich pat-
rols. When the destroyers Swift and Broke
engaged a bevy of German T.B.D.’s in the
Channel, Evans was the man who deliber-
ately rammed his adversary. The Germans
leapt aboard his command, and umpty um
of them were shot and cut down before it
became clear that Fritz’s only motive in
charging on to the British boat was to sur-
render. Evans got promotion for his gal-
lantry, and followed it up by marrying a
beautiful Norse girl.
Justice Tom Slaney Poole, M.A., LL.B.,
Warden of Adelaide ’Varsity Senate in suc-
cession to Fred Chappie (who ran the show
for nearly 40 years), took his arts and law
degrees in Melbourne Uni., was called to
the Vic. Bar in 1897, and raised to the S.
Aus. Supreme Court Bench in 1919. He is
dignified, and a Judge to the manner born.
His dad, Canon F. Slaney Poole, formerly
rector of St. John’s, Adelaide, was Acting-
Prof. of Classics at Adelaide ’Varsity from
1878 till 1894. The Judge’s wife is a daugh-
ter of Francis Williams, for many years the
autocrat of St. Peter’s College.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I saw a little Sydney girl
Reclining on a seat.
Her hair was thick with clustered curl:
Her face serene and sweet.
The magic of the summer skies
Had lingered in her eyes.
I looked at her; my head did swim—
Her cheeks were like the rose.
Her feet, her little hands, were trim
The sun had kissed her nose.
Thought I, “To have those lips to kiss
Would fill my soul with bliss.”
Beside her on the seat I sat:
I pressed her dimpled arm.
“You’re beautiful” (I told her that),
“I fall beneath your charm.”
But she—she barely turned her head.
“Aw, cut it out!” she said.

“Golub”: The new 9ft. snake recently
presented to the Sydney Museum may be a rare speci-
men, as alleged, but it is by no means the first of its
kind to have been captured, the variety being fairly
well known in the Cape York Peninsula country,
especially on the eastern side of the Gulf. It is
claimed by some experts that its proper classification

"As a matter of fact, I think it’s optional.’’

have for this it is difficult to sec. In markings, habits,
character of venom and everything else it more closely
resembles the brown snake of Eastern Australia
(Dimenia textilis'). It might, in fact, be taken for
an overgrown specimen of D. textilis. As far as its
venom is concerned, it belongs to the eolubrine class,
as does practically every poisonous snake in the Com-
monwealth and New Guinea, it being extremely
doubtful if there is a true representative of the
viperine class here. The most noteworthy thing
about the Museum’s new specimen, which comes from
11. L. White, of Belltrees (N.S.W.), is the size of Its
poison glands and the amount of their secretion,
which is probably the greatest after the eolubrine
genus Doliophis, whose glands are the biggest known,
although their anatomical situation is different to
that of any other snake, being placed in the first
third of the body - instead of in the head.
“Mirza”: “Keystring’s” cocky (B.
9/11/’22), who demanded a sprat refund from the
Red Cross because he couldn’t demolish all their
bob luncheon, is a philanthropist compared with a
Vic. country sawbones I know. With a lucrative
practice and 30,000 quid, he used to get his medicine
gratis from the local pill-pounder ; and when leaving
the district he collected all the empties (which Pills
had presented him with), returned them to the
chemist, asked for and got full market rates—a
cheque for £2 6s.

“Allinga”: “W.H.H.” (B. 12/10/’22) in-
stances an Afghan, Karum Bux, riding a camel from
Alice Springs (N.T.) to Oodnadatta, 335 miles, in
five days. In January, 1907 (the, month old Sol
works overtime), Frank Wallis, a well-known Centra-
lian, now - of Gippsland (Vic.), did the same journey
on a camel named Prince under five days and arrived
at Oodnadatta just in time to board the rattler to
Adelaide, 688 miles further. Neither he nor the
camel was any the worse. The same man rode a
horse from Arltunga to Oodnadatta through the bush
(no road), about 300 miles, in seven days. Both
arrived fit. A well-known bush official rode a Cen-
tralian horse from Pine Creek to Katherine, 70 miles,
during the night (5 p.m. till 8 a.in.), and crossed
five rivers. The same man rode a Centralian horse
from Alice Springs to Horseshoe Bend, 125 miles, in
two days, and continued on to the Charlotte on the
same horse, and completed the trip (200 miles) in
four days. He started back next day—and this in
December. Both these men rode over 13st., and the
horses were grass-fed. Joe Harding, over 50 years
of age and weighing move than 16st., rode a mare
from the Francis to the Alice, a 75-mile dry stage,
in the one up. He arrived about 8.30 p.m. as lively
as a cricket, and started pulling water from a well
for his plant.
“Wanda”: I£ # “Senex”* (B. 9/11/’22)
wants a seconder to his motion that lory and rosella
parrots cross, I’m willing. Here, on the South
Coast (N.S.W.), a few months back a bird was shot
bearing the distinct markings and beautifully blended
coloring of both species; and crossing was the only
likely means of producing such a specimen. The
feet, beak and size favored the lory, but the row of
white spots through the wings was missing. The
bird was forwarded to the National Museum; but,
owing to hot weather it did not “keep” long enough.
The Curator’s comment was that, to the best of his
belief, it was “a lory-rosella cross.”
“P.C. 49”: “Spark Plug” (B. 9/11/’22)
misfires in his statement re the weight of a pig
before and after drinking a bucket of milk. Being
a city man I don’t know much about pigs, but I
do know that to find out how much milk a breast-
fed baby gets one must weigh the youngster before
and after lie has his “spot.”

“Ajax”: Many women mined in the old
diggings days. Gold
was easily won with
dish or cradle from
shallow ground, and
anything thus earned
helped to pad the
family stocking. Even
now, particularly on
alluvial tin-fields, you
meet women fossickers.
Quaint-looking objects
some of them are in
man’s shirt, moleskin
pants, bowyangs and
blutclier boots, with
the “eternal feminine”
asserting itself in sun-
bonnets and veils.
They are all expert
“panners”—l know
some who, as to quick-
ness in dishing and
cleanness of product,
would need no points
from the best of men.
They are unrivalled
“banjoists”—a job
that means standing to
the bare knees in dirty
water and using a,
long-handled scoop to
direct water on to the
wash-dirt. It is not as
simple as it looks, but
is very laborious, and
involves skill and good
judgment, the object >f
the operation being to
create a swirl that will
keep the tin back and
bring the barren dirt
forward. Women’s
patience is also an
important factor in the “dressing” of dirty tin.
Many of these feminine workers are peeresses as
bush-lawyers, as all option-seekers and wardens can
testify.

“T.V.T.”: A pea-thresher, swinging a flail
in a paddock near the road at Lancefield (Vic.),
exasperated at a long procession of callers, fixed up a
“notice-board” made from the bottom of an old card-
board suit case and stuck it up in a break in the
hedge fence where they used to come in. It bore the
following in large letters: —-
It is 3J miles to Lancefield Junction. There’s a pub
there —beer fair to middlin’. I haven’t got any
tobacco (don’t smoke) ; no matches either. I am get-

“The Sehoolie”: There is a pitiful other
side to all the talk of bush mothers who cheerfully
attend to themselves at childbirth. Too often the
bush husband thinks there’s no need for special
attention. I taught one family of orphans, two of
whom were tongue-tied and deaf, and the others
more or less subnormal. The neighbors told me
that their mother was always alone and uncared
for, and at last died a fearful death with the eighth

called the 30-mile-distant doctor, but too late.
Another mother had two babies alone in the hills
eight miles from the nearest neighbor. Both died,
and rather than face the ordeal again the woman
committed suicide. I taught one weakling whose
mother had given birth to her while out looking for
some lost calves. The woman was not at all
affected, but the child will never recover from the
lack of care. Because of these and other cases I
know of I don’t like to see any eulogy of the
exceptional women who are physically fit to be
alone, for fear that some bushman may be tempted
to leave his wife to the risk of an agonising death,
or let his child start life permanently handicapped.

“Adrem”: “H.V.E.” (B. 2/11/’22), re the
crossing of domestic and wild ducks, reminds me that
the Paradise duck has not been known to mate with
any other breed either domestic or wild. At Para-
dise (head of Lake Wakitupu, M.L.) this duck has
steadily refused to mate with the domestic variety,
though a friend of mine has been trying for some
years to produce the cross. This bird, by the way,
does not mate until the third season at least, and
generally the same pair breed together till death.
Some birds, whose mates have been shot, have been
known to frequent the scene of the tragedy for years,
and the sight of a lone duck winging its way for-
lornly across the sky, as we tramped the Cold Lakes
district, never failed to draw from my mate,
“There’s goes a widowed bird.”
“Gouger”: A little while back I struck
the skeleton of a horse, hanging
pathetically by the hind hooves
from a forked tree. The way I
size it up is that the horse and
another must have been having a
kicking match near the tree, and
the dead horse happened to land
both hooves high in the forked
branch, where they were caught
fast. 1 came across a lonely cedar-
cutter once who almost met the
same end. He had fallen a giant
tree from where it forked. At the
first warning “creak” he jumped,
but his foot slipped, and he
slithered down into the fork, his
boot jambing with the weight.
The tree fell, but nothing serious
hit him, and he had been hanging
there two hours when I came
along, quite by accident.
“Jim Carew”: Two old-timers met at my
diggings last week, and during the evening an
argument cropped up which nearly ended in a fight.
Will the Abo. Council settle it for us? When a
horse is really pulling is there more strain on his
hind legs than his front legs?
• * * «
“The Rumpus”: “Valamac” says (B.
26/10/’22) that a fox disdains to take refuge in a
hollow log - . All the hollow log 3 in his district must
be tenanted with snakes or bushrangers. In the
Ovens Valley (Vic.), about 17 years ago, Alice
Keating, then a girl of 14, chased a fox into a log,
and grabbed him by ihe tail. She pulled with all
her might and dragged the animal out and downhill
towards her mother, who despatched Reynard with an
axe.
* * * •
“M.E.S.”: Re “Old Timer’s” query (B.
21/9/’22) as to how dingoes
kill 18-months old cattle.
One dingo would never
attack a beast that big.
The dogs don’t choke
young cattle. I once saw
four dingoes after a cow
with a young calf. They
waited until they had an
opening, then one sprang
at the calf’s hind-quart-
ers and chopped its tail
off. As the cow - wheeled
around another dingo
caught the calf by the
loins. It was at that point
that I had a say in the
business. Another time 1
came upon a dingo eating
a calf alive. It had most
of the calf’s hind-quarter
eaten, and the fact that
the calf was still alive
shows that dingoes don’t
choke them, as stated by
“Old Timer.” Again, 1
saw a pack of dingoes—
I cannot say if there were
five or six, but there were
no less—attacking a two-
year-old heifer. They sur-
rounded her, then one big
dog went for her head as
soon as she made a charge
at him, and the rest closed
in. I noticed that one
sprang on her back, and
another caught her by the
tail, and it would un-
doubtedly have been the
end of the beast had no
one come on the scene.
The reason that I didn’t
stay the attack at the out-
set was that I wanted to
see how the cowards go
about their killing.
“Beuitn”: “E.J.D.” (B. 26/10/’22) says
cattle are sulky when “down.” It appears to be more
than mere “sulk,” as they seem to be quite immune
to pain. I have seen a fat, strong cow pulled out
from between a steep bank and a gum-tree, where she
had been stuck for two days. When extricated she
utterly refused to move, and it was thought her
limbs were paralysed, as, though she was lifted fairly
on to her feet, she simply “flopped,” without even
attempting to stand on them. The usual barbaric
stunts were resorted to —boots, tail-twisting, fires,
etc., but she hardly even flinched. Just as the
cockies decided to go for the axe, the lad who was
in the habit of yarding the cows came down the
hill, and giving his customary daybreak whistle,
yelled, “Heel ’er, Bluey!”—and though Bluey was
conspicuously absent, the invalid sprang to her feet
and started off for the mob at a trot.
• * * *
“Magela Bada” : “Gaigai” (B. 9/11/’22)
is incredulous in regard to my par. on the haino,
and states that the sight of any snake will send Port
Moresby natives running in the other direction —
which is incorrect. When the Government House
grounds are cleaned once a year by the village
natives, two or three boys always manage to bring
back a haino in their hair. I recall a dance held
in the Institute Hall about three years ago, when a
haino was brought into the ballroom by a young
civil servant. Its appearance caused a sensation and
a clear passage among the dancers, but the natives
THE CONVERSATIONALIST.
“Oh, Horace, he’s learning to recite 'Baa, baa, black
sheep, have you any wool?' "
“Does he say all that?"
“Not all of it yet; but he’s got as far as ‘Baa, baa'!’’
dispensing refreshments volubly explained its harmlcss-
ness and their superstition in regard to it. Inciden-
tally, the official who brought the haino to the dance
apparently created the impression among the nigs,
that he was collecting snakes, and for some weeks
afterwards natives brought him in their bare hands
sundry specimens of non-venomous wrigglers, among
them a black and white-ringed water-snake called by
them “hohorareva,” which has a particularly fear-
some appearance.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Twas the first day of October ;
All the anglers round the bar
(And you know what anglers are
When they’re not exactly sober)
Vainly sought a valid reason
Why they’d have a decent season.
Then old Honi with a chuckle
Said that last week he was out
And caught twenty bosker trout;
And he stuck a bony knuckle
In a fellow drinker’s side:
“Twenty beauts," and swelled with pride.
But the victim grabbed his shoulder:
“Do you know my name?” he said;
And the Maori shook his head.
“Well, you will ere you're much older.
I’ve just been appointed ranger
Of this district,” said the stranger.
“And perhaps you may remember
When the fishing season’s out
’Tis illegal to catch trout.
Yet you tell us in September
(You were certainly most candid)
At least twenty fish you landed.”
Honi straightened his attire.
“I suppose you not to blame
If you never heard my name.
I’m the biggest plurry liar
(Ask the others here),” he cried,
“In the whole damn country-side.”

“Big Spider”: The dingo who vanished
over the horizon after “W. G. Bee” had removed his
scalp (B. 9/11/’22) reminds me of a similar case
in which I had shot a native-bear. She fell with a
piteous cry, so human that I couldn’t help feeling
remorseful, but as the deed was done I slit her
throat and commenced to remove the silver-grey
pelt. I had it all hanging loose when Suddenly she
got on her feet and started for the gum-tree. U
made me sick, but she collapsed after a few yards,
so I finished the job and took a solemn oath never
to shoot another bear.
* * » #
“The Overlander”: Re hanging lanterns
round camping cattle (B. 12/10/’22). Twenty years
ago Charley Easton lit fires at intervals round
his mobs wherever he
could get wood, and
found they camped
better. Anyhow, my
view is that touchy
cattle are like women
—you never know
when you ve got ’em.
A QUESTION OF TABLE MANNERS.
John Hor: “ 'Ere, Dirty Dick, this is a
filthy 'abit of yours, eating from dirt-
tins. Look at the mess it makes in the
street."
“Borom”: Re “Equiuine’s” cure for swamp
cancer in horses (B. 9/11/’22), for which he recom-
mends the removal of the growth with a sharp knife
and the painting of the raw surface that is left with
undiluted nitric acid. This is all right; but the
efficacy of the acid lies in the fact that when it
comes into contact with the protoplasmic cell-sub-
stance in the tissues, it brings about the formation
of picric acid, or trinitrophenol, which in some
THE BETTER PART.
“Ever tried to drive a car, Judge?"
“No; but I've tried several who have."
way promotes the replacement of damaged cells by
new ones. The same react on is seen when a little
nitric acid is placed on the skin of the hand, the
spot turning yellow, which :s the characteristic color
of picric acid, because of latter’s formation in
the tissues. Hence, a better effect may be obtained
by using picric instead of nitric acid, a two per cent,
solution being quite strong fenough ; and, in addition,
the remedy is less severe bn the animal. Otherwise,
“Equinine’s” instructions hold good.
“X.R.M.0.” : “The Moralist” (B. 5/10/’22),
“J. Jack Tar” (B. 26/10/’22) and “Spark Plug”
(B. 9/11/’22) are all talking hot air. No one but
a congenital idiot would believe that a pig was cap-
able of drinking more than its own bulk of milk at
one sitting. Even supposing it could, the combined
bulk of pig, plus milk, must be greater than the
original bulk of pig or milk alone, because milk
is incompressible, and so is the pig, with the excep-
tion of its lungs and gas contained in its alimentary
canal. The milk, when first imbibed, is still milk
until digested, so no explanation or evasion on that
score is allowable. As for “J. Jack Tar” and his
hosepipe theory ; 10yds. of lin. hosepipe would hold
less than half an ordinary-sized bucket. If the pig's
intestines (“J.J.T.’s” hosepipe) accommodated the
other half by stretching, the pig would have 10
swell correspondingly. So that’s that. “Spark Plug’s”
idea that food or drink does not increase the weight
of the animal partaking thereof is an old myth.
How does he think any animal ever grows? Any-
way, let him try the experiment, and if no pig is
available, let him weigh himself, quickly get outside
a few beers and then weigh again.
* * * *
“Nugget” : I’d like to enter a pony for the
Queer Accident Stakes. A two-year-old we were
breaking-in on the Upper Hunter
(N.S.W.), a few years ago, got
away with a hide halter round his
neck, through some inspired idiot
shutting the yard gate without
latching it. He had a clear run
up into the mountains, and after
a couple of days’ searching we
found him hanging stone dead
over a rock ledge from the broken
I'liib of a tree. Maybe he deliber.
ately committed suicide as a pro-
test against the price paid for
him ; but I think it more probable
that while on the hillside he got
to rubbing his head against the
broken limb in an attempt to rid
iiimself of the irritating halter, then, finding himself
caught, plunged about and slipped over the edge.
“I)ido”: They were conducting a big dam-
sinking operation, and a plank ran over the deeper
cut, along which Hegan had to push his barrow.
Hegan was not an expert with a barrow ; he was new
to the country, and having to tote a load of mud
over the heads of pick-and-shovel men made him
nervous. One morning the inevitable wobble occurred,
and Hegan’s full barrow crashed between Monagau
and Wells. There was a fearful outcry. Wells, in
particular, cursing poor Hegan from Geelong to
breakfast, while the culprit stood, pale and trem-
bling, anticipating the sack. At length Wells’s out-
pouring of profanity became intolerable. “You blank,
blank asterisk, shut up, can’t you?” wailed Hegan.
“Begor, if yeh make a row like that you’ll have the
boss thinkin’ I’ve killed yeh.”
“Mulgaite”: Does any Abo.-upholder of
the truth know of a case entitled to more merit for
grit and perseverance than this digging stunt of
Spinifex George, at Edjudina (W.A.). Having located
a reef carrying good values, and being possessed of a
wheelbarrow, a couple of picks and a shovel only,
George decided to sink a spiral shaft, using the
barrow as a means of getting the mullock to the
surface. He cut the reef at 60ft. vertical (proved
afterwards by rising to the surface), but his shaft
was 290 ft. The hole still exists as a monument to
the class of battlers of the roaring ’nineties.
“A. Borig”: “Adrem” (B. 2/11/’22)
seems to think that my heliographing from Nimity-
belle to Kosciusko (N.S.W.) was something beyond
the common. Yet I did it without much trouble,
and I repeat that probably another 50 miles would
have been possible. It took me over a week to
locate “Kossy” the usual old hands having pointed
out to me the highest-fooKny peak, which must have
been 30 miles from the real thing. Then the next
morning the Kosciusko observer’s light was fair on
to me. Within an hour over a dozen residents
were up to point it out to me. They had seen it
without looking, as it were. Perhaps the fact of
the alignment being due east and west made a differ-
ence, but my idea is that it is the wonderful Monaro
atmosphere. The school at Nimity. is fairly' on the
top of the Monaro Range, consequently the line of
sight was mostly at a great height. The clearness
of the atmosphere, though, is wonderful. When I
first went to Nimity. I intended walking out one
morning to climb Jenabruthera (“Jimmy Brothers”)
mountain. A Mr. Evans told me to start early, as
it meant a 24-mile walk, there and back. I had
thought it was about five miles, as I could see the
sheep and even two or three goats with them grazing
on the hill —and with the naked eye at that. Inci-
dentally, the late E. W. O’Sullivan was very inter-
ested in my helio. contraption and its work.
* * * #
“Peter QuilTo”: “Joe Collins” (B.
26/10/’22) asks, “W T hy is it that the bodies of birds
poisoned with strychnined grain are harmless to any-
thing that may eat them?” I laid strychnined wheat
for sparrows last week: Result: haif-a-dozen dead
sparrows and two just-as-dead cats.
* * * ♦
“Parama”: “C. Coral” (B. 9/11/’22) on
Torres Strait islanders being unable to “place” flour
and rice looted from wrecked ships, reminds me of
a yarn I had from the oldest islander in the Strait.
As a boy he was present at the looting of a wreck
on the reef off Stephen Island. The flour and rice
were thrown overboard, as they were thought to be
nothing but ashes and ants’ eggs. But there were a
number of cases of soap in the hold, and this was
considered a prize, and was greedily eaten by the
looters, who imagined that the uniform yellow bars
were a special “strong feller medicine fat.” My
informant, being only a boy, was not allowed to
share in the “medicine,” the grown men and young
warriors keeping it all for themselves. “But,” he
said with a grin, “too much strong that white man’s
medicine fat. All those men they close up finish.
They too much sick altogether.”
* * * *
“Prof”: “Maete’s” blackboy who wanted
to know how the train was hobbled (B. 9/11/’22)
reminds me. When Johnny came to Sydney with
his master from the Solomons, the things that “got”
him most were the trams that ran along the suburban
street in which they were staying. The second morn-
ing his master’s early cup of tea and biscuit not
being forthcoming, Johnny was searched for and
discovered sitting upon the kerb outside and gazing
at the passing trams. “What are you doing there,
Johnnyasked the boss. “Me been lookern this
feller house he races go alonga road,” replied the
islander.
* * *
“Groper”: “Sucre’s” Hindoo, who shaved
with a cane-knife (B. 19/10/’22), reminds me of the
early days of the timber industry at Denmark (W.A.).
The place was full of experts, and one of ’em showed
his skill by trimming his iinger-nails with the
whizzing 6ft. saw at the big bench. Jt was a nerve-
test, if nothing else.
“Gumbug”: “P'aul C.” (B. 12/10/’22)
says animals race along in front of the headlight of
a car at night because they are afraid to plunge into
the wall of impenetrable blackness at either side.
Yet I’ve seen Bunny transfixed by the engine travel-
ling from Carnarvon (W.A.) to the local jetty, the
headlight of which is just about bright enough to
let pedestrians know whether the train is coming or
going. In this particular case it looks as if the
animal’s stupefaction arose as much from the noise—
the cause being invisible owing to the light—as from
any dazzling effects of the light itself.
“Bushog” : Re “Ned Kelly’s” old orchard-
ist who said that when a gum-tree throws off an
excess of manna it’s going to die (B. 26/10/’22). On
a tongue of land between Pittwater and Frederick
Henry Bay (Tas.) are thousands of gums which
throw off tons of manna. I haven’t seen anything
like it elsewhere in Australia. And yet this is the
only place in the Speck where blacks’ toeholds can
be seen on trees. After producing manna for
donkey’s years these ancient saplings are as hale and
hearty as ever.
* * * *
“B.” : Though rabbits have been so par-
celled farmer Everard, of Pinkerton Plains (S. Aus.),
is the first I’ve heard of to truss a fox in a sheaf
of hay with his binder. He was working the
machine recently and had many stoppages on account
of the density of the crop. The binder was jolting
frequently, and he therefore didn’t take much notice
when there was a bigger bump than usual. The
machine went on working smoothly, but Everard
noticed some splashes of blood and thought he had
run over a rabbit, so he investigated. In one of
the sheaves he found a fox, surrounded with hay
and securely encircled with twine. The unlucky
Reynard had both hind legs chopped off.
* * * •
“Exul” returns to his snake: —
I don’t know who performed the experiments
quoted by “Colub” (B. 2/11/’22) in contravention
of my assertion that death from the venom of the
black snake was usually due to cardiac or respiratory
failure, and which prove, according to him, that
its fatal effect is from the haemolysis (destruction of
the red blood corpuscles) produced by it. C. J.
Martin, quoted by Profs. Welsh and Chapman in
their brochure on snake venom is my authority. These
authors say that in poisoning by this snake
“haemolysis may be met”- —which doesn’t seem to
imply that it is a prominent feature of it. Martin
directly experimented with this venom to determine
its haemolytic power, and he found that of mam-
malian bloods “the red cells of the dog were the
most sensitive” (to destruction by this particular
venom) “while human blood was particularly resist-

“Yairs. ’E says ’e can keep iced beer in it
for forty-eight hours."
“ 'E must be a teetotaller."
ant.” Perhaps “Colub’s” experiments were per-
formed on dogs. The power of destroying red blood
cells is, according to W. and C., a much more con-
spicuous property of viperine than of eolubrine
venom. The black snake belongs to the latter class,
and in this the poison chiefly acts by destroying
nervous tissues. In this view they are supported by
Calmette and Noguchi. It is worth noting that when
(as usually happens) intravascular clotting, the
positive phase of coagulation, does not or cur as a
result of a bite by this snake, a negative phase sets
in and the blood clots with less ease than normally,
As to delayed death from the action of the venom on
the lungs and kidneys, I should have stated that the
risk of this is not great except in dogs.
YALLOURN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Yallourn, where the brown coal is dug, is to be
the most moral model town in the world.” — Commis-
sioner John Monash.
Yallourn in its maturity
Will be a gracious city,
Where nothing low or foul will be,
And no one tough and gritty.
There all the folks will be polite,
And cleanly their condition,
And everything will be all right
As vouched by the commission.
The tom-cat will not yowl at night
In this serene position.
Yallourn will have its' churches ten
For Christian and Aryan ;
But they’ll prohibit naughty men
Whose bias is sectarian.
The many creeds must all agree—
Don’t think that I’m satirical —■
To this commissioners will see.
Of course, it’s not empirical,
But ’twill be done eventually
E’en though it needs a miracle.
The people well must comb their hair,
And take a bath once daily ;
Commissioners will be aware
And supervising gaily.
If any stranger come to town
His business must be stated.
If suitable he’ll settle down,
Well tabbed and duly rated;
Not till his morals by the crown
Have been investigated.
So burglars, thieves and fellows vile
Who pick their neighbors’ pockets
Will not succeed by any wile
In taking up their dockets.
By methods psychological
Uncovered is their sinning.
Where none are wicked all are dull,
And naughty men are grinning,
For spielers come where sits the gull,
As ’twas in the beginning.
When we went out with open mind
To feast upon its virtue,
Not dreaming that we’d chance to find
A thing there that would hurt you.
We chanced upon a blime bloke
In Yallourn’s open spaces,
Who common interest awoke
With certain arts and graces,
Defying natives at a stroke
To pick the little aces 1

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
ROGER & GALLET
Perfurnes Soaps Powders
St. John’s College held another jazz at
the Wentworth last week. Though the re-
doubtable Father O’Reilly remained in the
seclusion of the college cloisters, the lads
turned up in large numbers, as the flutter
was to bring health and strength to the
sports funds. As a result the fifth-year meds.,
Hill, McKeown, Fitzgerald and Sullivan, who
ran the dance, can now settle down to a
quiet life of disembowelling and appendix-
barbering, leaving the worries of fevered
finance behind. One of the smartest
dressers was Dr. George McElhone’s wife,
who owes her pretty complexion to Ye Banks
and Braes. Tall Pixie Herbert (whose
name proves the fallacy of putting a handle
to a child before it is grown up) ruffled
sweetly in black. There were two or three
layers of Oxenhams, and Mrs. Wilson, J.P.,
who takes the kiddies of the slum areas out
for days in the open spaces, now threw herself
into her reverse gear and brought a party of
young people from one of the plutocratic
Points for a night in Sydney’s most crowded
dancing area. One of the prettiest dresses
enveloped Dr. Fraser’s chick Isabel—it was
a froth of gold tissue and blue-and-gold tulle.
The Commerford girleens were there, in shell-
pink and honey-colored taffeta, and Dorothy
ILagon was another well-favored young thing
who danced in primrose georgette.
Lionel Lawson’s recital the other night was
quite a social uplift for the Conservatorium.
Their State Exes, came along to cheer the
young fiddler on his path to fame, and well-
groomed heads in all the best seats seemed
imbued with the same desire. Lawson, who
gave up his studies at the outbreak of the
war .to join up with the Flying Force, is a
sensitive-looking youngster, whose bow
charms a pure tone from his violin; and his
work was especially fine in the adagio and
fugue from Bach’s “G Minor Sonata,” with
which the programme opened. Agnes
Caspers was .at the piano when the violin
played in conjunction with that instrument;
later on Laurence Godfrey Smith played a
lone hand on the concert grand, mostly illus-
trating the brilliancy of Brahms, and, cas-
cading in between the more forceful torrents
of instrumental sound came the music of
Clem Williams’s voice.
Lionel Lawson, by the way, got married the
other week. She is a fluffy young daughter
of Mrs. Gore-Jones, who helps organise the
social round that keeps the Royal Prince
Alfred’s linen and accessories in healthy
condition. Her dad is Francis Gore-Jones,
of Marimba, Buderin (Q.).
The engagement is announced of Joyce,
the auburn-haired daughter of the B. F.
Parkers (he is the senior Parker of the
legal firm of Dibbs, Parker and Parker), to
Milford Charles, of Warrawong, North Tum-
bulgum. Enid, the elder Parker daughter,
was married in London during the war. She
and her husband, Owen Rowland, and baby
Clover, live at Alver-Gwylly, near Tam-
worth. Clover is named after her mother’s
clan, one of whom, Nelson Clover, is the
commander of H.M.A.S. Penguin.
The 7th Field Company is holding a
reunion smoko at Sargent’s, 390 George-street,
Sydney, to-night (Thursday). Although
this is a reunion of the 7th, the committee
will welcome members from any other Field
Company who care to go along.
The Davidsons joined the crowd at the
M.C.C.-N.S.W. fixture on the Cricket Ground
last week. Himself was there in all his anec-
dotal and reminiscent array on both Friday
and Saturday (only the merest accident, it
is understood, prevented him from being a
Test cricketer himself), and Dame Margaret
and friends sat it out on Saturday. The
Dame’s party set a Simple Life note. While
the crowd on the hill devoured sandwiches
and washed them down with beer, the vice-
regals adjourned to their car, pulled down
the blinds and worried a cold collation in
private.
Though some of the visiting English
cricketers are unknown to the present genera-
tion, their progenitors have been heard of
before in Sydney. D. F. Brand is a son of
Lord Hampden, the N. S. Wales Governor
who ruled when bicycling first held sway
in these parts. Old-timers still talk fondly
of the Hampden Club, designed to enable
“the nicest people to meet one an-
other in the nicest possible manner.”
The young man bowled so ably against
N.S.W. that the Government House party
nearly burst its gloves with delight. Another
familiar name is that of A. C. Wilkinson, a
tail and elegant youth whose father is Dr.
Camac Wilkinson, one-time of Sydney ’Var-
sity, and himself a cricketer of note: he
played both with I Zingari and East Syd-
ney clubs. The Wilkinsons are settled per-
manently ,in London now.
Frank S. Bennet, only son of the jolly
Macquarie-street medico, an athletic young
man, who held the mile championship for
three years at Cranbrook School, has gone
jackerooing in Central Bananaland. He
shortly goes to Bradford (Eng.), to pick
up points about wool, and on his return will
settle on the land in N.S.W.
Women swarmed like locusts about the
big dining-room of the Cavalier the other
afternoon to say good-bye to Lute Drum-
mond, who sails for Europe shortly after
Christmas. The tea-party was a thanks-
giving for the work she has done in
helping the cause of opera in Australia.
Rambler roses and carnations, loot from
many a rich suburban garden, swooned on
every table; and Lute was almost lost
behind a gigantic offering of pink rosebuds
and trailing fern. Every woman who has
the suspicion of an interest in Movements
was there, but though the gathering smacked
of blue stockings, there wasn’t a woman
whose hose wasn’t silk from toe to knee.
Some of the hats, too, were worth a
mention, the blue ribbon for graceful
line going unanimously to Miss Floyd
Williams. Mrs. England’s hat expressed
the charm of black plumes at their
best; while pretty Ruth Ainsworth looked
with the gravity of youth from under a lid
that suggested the petals of a pink rose.
Audrey Petherick and Jean Drummond were
both in soft brown, and both brought on a
smudge of their afternoon make-up from the
llaymarket. Ruth Beale, Tlieo Cowan, Mrs.
Hardy Wilson and Jean Hinder (from
Farmer’s Welfare) were other tea-drinkers.
Clifford Lathlean, Allen Priora, Clement
Hosking, David Lindsay and Harry Burchall
added masculine notes to the feminine choir;
and, finally, when Mrs. A. G. Thomas handed
Lute an exquisitely-small platinum wrist
watch, and to Jean an Ada Newman brooch,
there was a loud burst of enthusiasm that
rippled into wavelets of good-byes. The
two leave for a final visit to Brisbane at the
end of the week.
The Union Club, for the first time in its
history, is going in for a manageress.
Hitherto, the managing has been done by
secretaries at £5OO a year or thereabouts.
Mr. Blythman, who was secretary before the
war and left the job to serve with the 13th
Battalion (A.1.F.), is acting in that capa-
city at present; but on the Ist of next month
he leaves for a similar job at the Imperial
Service Club, and on New Year’s Day the
lady steps in. Some of the soldier members
are distinctly annoyed about it all.
This is May Moore’s picture of Kathleen
O’Connor, from Bowral, a brown-eyed
daughter of the late
Justice O’Connor, of
the High Court. The
Musicians’ Corpora-
tion have thought
well enough of her
lullaby, with words
by Shamus McManis,
to publish it. Nearly
all Kathleen’s music*
is tinged with the
Celtic atmosphere so
beloved by Arnold
Bax; but occasion-
ally she and her
friend Mrs. Creagh
collaborate, and then
the result is a jazz
tune that would set
you dancing your
slippers through.
Miss Floyd Williams was entertained at a
morning party at Ivambala early this week.
Miss Roseby, the principal of the Rose Bay
school, had arranged a programme of modern
music, and Roy Agnew illustrated Australian
composers for the popular Californian. An-
other feature of the party was the iced tea
without which no Yankee lady can feel truly
refreshed. Among the guests were Com-
mander and Mrs. H. L. Quick. He is Syd-
ney’s new naval superintendent or something,
and a cousin of the Roseby clan, and she
was pretty Violet Marshal], widow of the
brewer.
Barbara Laidley and Tom Street, of Bow-
ral, have decided on housekeeping together in
the near future. She’s wearing the usual
token. News of another engagement that
rippled dancing circles last week came from
Colombo —that of Doon Mackin to Captain
Lustock Bell. R.G.A., adjutant to General
Rowley. This wedding is dated for early
in the year.
There was Romance lurking behind last
week’s formal announcement that Denis
Allen had been admitted to practise as a
solicitor. A parental ukase had laid it down
that he was not to get married till he had
passed his examinations as an attorney. His
case affords a queer illustration of war and
peace values respectively. Six years ago he
had an important command in France, and
that was followed by a flying job in Eng-
land which called for all sorts of qualities
besides mere mechanical skill, and for the
making of plans and decisions on the
success of which hundreds, not to say thou-
sands, of lives depended. In 1922 he has
to toil hard for the right, if so disposed, to
appear before a police-court magistrate and
save a Sydney reveller from the consequences
of his alcoholic indiscretions.
S. H. Prior, editor of this paper, and his
wife are homeward bound aboard the
Naldera, and should reach Sydney about
the middle of next month. They have spent
nearly a year travelling in the United States
and on the harassed European continent,
and visiting English relatives. That is why
this year’s Christmas Number of The Bul-
letin lacks a contribution with the initials
“S.H.P.” attached to it. He is about the
only front-rank Australian writer who is
not represented in the issue.
Here you have a May Moore impression
of George Lambert, whom England in-
sulted last week with an A.R.A. He
spent his early years in the bush, and
the old habits still
linger in the form of
a passion for riding-
breeches and such
hats as he is wearing
in the picture. Most
of his early black-and-
white work appeared
in The Bulletin.
Then he took to
painting; won the
Wynne prize with
“Across the Black-
soil Plains” (the
plaudits of the un-
cultured in respect
of this work rather
pain him to-day) ;
was awarded the
Society of Artists’
travelling scholar-
ship ; went to Lon-
don; and from that day, 22 years ago,
to this, has had a career of uninterrupted suc-
cess. He arrived here on a visit some months
ago—his home is in the British artists’
Mecca, Chelsea —and he has done a lot of
fine work in the time. Modest and unassum-
ing to a fault, he is extremely popular in
the social worlds of both Sydney and Mel-
bourne.
The Loreto gardens at Kirribilli were all
dressed up in their best jacaranda bloomings
on Saturday afternoon, when the convent
celebrated its wedding to the neighboring
Milson home. The Milson property was
bought some little time ago, and now that
the dividing fence is down the two gardens
melt naturally into each other —both might
have been planted by the same hands at the
sdme time as the trees and shrubs are of the
same family. The grounds were crowded by
pupils past and present, and every R.C.
family of note had at least one representa-
tive at the party. The laughing-eyed young
nun who, “in the world,” was Maude
Heaton, came in for an unexpected blaze of
limelight, because it was through her
mother’s generosity in paying off the debt on
the old property that the convent has been
able to spread its wings. However, there is
still a little load of nearly £6OOO to be
wrestled with. The Delegate, in full pon-
tificals, was the guest of honor, and just as
his car slid through the gates the Westmead
boys, who were dispensing the music, were
inspired to strike up “A Policeman’s Life
Is Not a Happy One.”
Mayoress McElhone is extending the glad
hand to Ada Reeve to-day in her rooms at
the Town Hall. Ada, who has just finished
a great season in Melbourne, is looking for-
ward to the same sort of time in Sydney.
Already the gramophones of Darlinghurst
are churning out “The roses round the door
make me love mother more,” and so on.
Jack Lindsay, Norman’s eldest son, who
married the only daughter of Lachlan Beaton
the other day, has a cottage at Bondi, in
which he and the young w T oman (who also
writes) propose to pursue literature in an
intensive manner. Amongst other activities
he is installing a printing-press, which is to
be operated on the premises, with the, help
of his brother Phil, now one of Julian Ash-
ton’s pupils. Their first attempt in the
printing line will be an edition, as de luxe
as they can make it, of one of their brilliant
father’s books.
Pretty Nancy Kiss, of Randwick, is wear-
ing a permanent reminder of Alex. Macneil’s
taste in the matter of an engagement-
ring. He is the second son of Hugh Mac-
neil, so long associated with the hardware
firm of Briscoe and Co.
Joan Tregarthen, who combines good looks
and popularity, is receiving applause from
over half the State on her engagement
to Hugh Main. The happy man was a
Digger, and is a well-known racing owner
and M.L.A. for Cootamundra, in which dis-
trict his station property lies. Joan, who
has been running the Sydney branch of
“Suzanne” (the O’Loughlins’ hatshop), has
broken all records as a seller of headgear.
It is said that prospective buyers have
almost snatched the lids oft' her head in
their eagerness to go out looking likewise.
Her maternal grandfather was Justice
Manning, of the Supreme Court Bench.
The first job Gertrude Lewis is handling
now that she is back in her niche at the
Australian Board of Missions headquarters
is the publicity for a matinee, the principal
feature of which is a new picture of her own
well-known Papua. The title is “The Heart
of New Guinea,” and it is to be shown on
December 4 in King’s Cross Theatre, the
gate money going, of course, to the civilisa-
tion of the natives who disport in the pic-
ture in all the joys of primitive unrestraint.
There has lately been on view at Anthony
Horderns’ Gallery an interesting little ex-
hibit of “photo sculpture.” For many years
experimenting photographers have been after
bas-relief effects by swelling the gelatine
of the negative with water, which is absorbed
in inverse ratio to the action of some de-
velopers; and, again, by using developing
agents that “tan” and shrink the gelatine,
leaving a sunken image of the subject photo-
graphed. But it remained for Fred 11. Mon-
teath, of Sydney—an old student of the Melb.
Art Gallery School —to achieve completely
satisfactory results. Whatever his method,
he turns out remarkable metal portrait
medallions in low relief that rival the finest
sculpture in effect. The practical applica-
tion of his idea to all sorts of metal work
promises to render it an invention of con-
siderable importance. Incidentally, he gets
some beautiful pictorial results by photo-
graphing and enlarging from his own plaster
intaglio casts. The little show has evoked
quite a lot of interest.
The Vagabonds did their end-of-the-year
dash with Haddon Chambers’s “The Saving
Grace.” The work of the Vagabonds is
really good, and very little of the writer’s
idea was lost. Ewart Jago, as the somewhat
faded remains of the dashing young officer
who had run away with his colonel’s wife,
and Ituby Coxhead, as that warm-hearted
sentimental feather-head, carried the burden
of the day, and made easy going of it. Ida
Gough added a rich voice and some subtle
tones to the argument. Other parts were
taken by Lalage Welch, George Stokes,
Valetta Cohen and Jack Rogers.
Andre Skalski drew a big house in
the Town Hall on Saturday. The
slim young man, whose charm lies in
the intimate and appealing character of his
work, loses something of this in the windy
vastness of the municipal torture-chamber.
In the “Five Lyric Pieces” of Grieg, his
hands were at their best and most poetic;
although the house rose most loudly over the
doubled-decked arrangement of the thunder-
ous Liszt “Hungarian Fantasy,” in which
Skalski took the bridge and Maurice Price
kept the lookout, each on a concert grand.
Muriel Cheek and Gertrude Healy, rounded
off the programme.
A Brisbane postscript:—
His Ex. gave several dinner-parties during the
week, at which Captain and Miss Harboard figured.
The Pitt Riverses and the Duchess of Hamilton are
at the moment sharing the shelter of Government
House.
Passed out at 80, Mrs. Pat Tully, of Ray station.
She was born in County Clare, and Pat, Mick and
Jerry Durack were the three brothers with whom
she came to Australia in ’53. The bhoys took up
Thylunga and Galway Downs, and in ’6l she mar-
ried Pat Tully, of Grabbin Gully (N.S.W.). Soon
afterwards Pat came to Queensland and settled at
Ray station, where the old couple not long ago cele-
brated their golden wedding. Seven children survive
—Mrs. O’Gorman, Mrs. John Bergin and two un-
married daughters (all of whom are in Brisbane at
present) and three sons who are engaged in pastoral
pursuits.
Rev. fathers galore gathered at Dr. Glynn Con-
nolly’s house, near the racecourse, for a function
in aid of St. Cecilia’s, at Hamilton, the other
day. Father Jordan, who is voted “too handsome
for a priest,” opened the affair, and a jazz band
played wildly in brilliantly-colorful surroundings.
His Majesty’s continues to present an adamantine
front to the pleasure-seeker, but the Theatre Royal
has decided that “Nothing but the Truth” pays, in
one sense, if not in another.
The other day the little Bergin twins, Jack and
Marie, had a scrumptious birthday-party. Nine liftle
blue candles surrounded the birthday-cake, Aunt
Sally smirked in a corner, there were peach blossom
and beribboned balloons everywhere, and rose bon-
bons held tiny gifts for each excited little guest,
among whom were the late Premier Ryan’s Jack
and Jill.
Francis Kenna, The Bulletin scribe, has suggested
to the Minister for Agriculture that Queensland wild-
flowers are worth cultivating, and the Authors and
Artists’ Association is asking that a bed be reserved
for them in the Botanic Gardens. Brisbane people
are just beginning to do the Columbus act, and dis-
cover what lovely flowers there are within a few
miles of a city which keeps on saying: “You should
see the wild flowers down south!”

The Girl Guides craze, which no one, so
rar, has shown any feverish desire to finance,
will get £5OO through the vice-regal Count-
ess s Bauble Ball, engineered with the help
°: ? s^ let y committee, at Carlyon’s last
• V the fi'ivol is an indication of what
Guiding stands for, then the movement
isn t likely to liang fire. The State Gover-
nor, with Ins jazzing lady, caparisoned in all
gieen, were Gorsaved in with due cere-
monial, after which they shed their vice-
regal dignity and revelled with the best. The
ba 1 bounded off on the lines of a Paul
Bibron cabaret until a few young bloods,
inspired by glorious recollections of Fog-
land night-club. revels, commenced to hit
things up in a more, hectic style, and there
were outbursts of cdtch-as-catch-can. One
damsel ran the risk' of having her chiffonery
torn off her back when she got tangled up
in a scrap. Mothers of families didn’t hesi-
tate to do their bit for the cause by jazzing
with gaudy paper belltoppers, and one
loorak matron even rose to the occasion by
fitting, on her partner’s sympathetic knee.
±he frivol ended in a fierce Snowballing con-
test with missiles made of kapok wrapped in
colored muslin. The vice-regals entered into
the contest with verve. The Russell Clarkes
brought a party. Mrs. Geoff Syme con-
voyed a group of attractive young things.
General Grimwade was there with his family,
and Geoyge Lambert turned up with
friends. r Others to be seen were Mrs.
Stogdale, 'Mrs. Leslie Stuart, Miss
TVyulasy, little Lady Digby and some pals,
™ e Chauvel and Best dames, the Bayles,
Maelunnons, Spowers, Staughtons, Winter
Irvings, Whitings, Eric Harrisons, Mrs.
I red Payne and Mrs. Charlie Lyon—all the
Very Nicest, in fact. And most of them
agreed that the ball was the brightest whirl
to date, whereat Mrs. Norman Brookes
and Marie de Bavay, the hon. secs., beamed
contentedly.
Archbishop Lees, of Melbourne, has jumped
°u* P ro P° s M voiced by some of his flock
that St. Paul’s should be shifted from its
present site at the corner of Flinders
and Swanston streets to the Domain.
It is a parish church as well as a
cathedral, he says, and is in the right place
to serve its purpose. That settles the con-
troversy for the time. But it was ai pretty
cool proposition to suggest that a bit of the
Domain was as easy to pinch as all that.
All the society that could be spared from
other events was: drammed into the stands
at the Albert Ground on Saturday to watch
the tennis championships 'finals. * The pavi-
lion showed tiers of Girl, baring yards of vivid
stocking to the cameramen, and clapping
in excitement as a small restless ball pounded
backwards and forwards. There is nothing
like tennis to shatter the ennui of the Very
Best people. On Saturday they had glad
hands for Pat O’Hara Wood.and Mrs. Lister,
who downed the overworked Jack Hawkes
and Miss Boyd In the mixed doubles. Both
ladies wore neat starched uniforms, but,
whereas the rounded Miss Boyd had plain
cotton stockings and concealed her good-
humored face under an ordinary shady hat,
the imperturbable Mrs. Lister sported much
smarter millinery, and her substantial calves
were encased in silk. Mrs. Lister is reckoned
the beauty of the courts, but she is not so
devastating to the average masculine eye as
Miss Fairbairn, Sos Wertheim’s beauteous
sister or the delightful vision who
made one matinee appearance in the mixed
doubles with a dinky golden bandeau around
her dark tresses. Miss J. B. Keltie is an-
other damsel who threatens to wreck the
contention that the average lady-player is.
burdened with a countenance made to con-
sume large meals and resist the hardest kic k
of the summer sun.
Ex-Mayoress Cabena has bagged next
Wednesday afternoon for her Spring at-home
party in the reception rooms at St. Neot’s,
South Yarra, which she is hiring for the
occasion.
All the Best Dressed turned up at the at-
home in the Quamby Club, hostessed by the
picturesque Goulburn Brooke matron, the
other afternoon. Mrs. Brooke was in sil-
very brocade girdled with steel under a black
feathery hat. Daughter Dorothy, who is a
top-notch tennis-player in the schoolgirl
class, helped her in all-white chiffon, with a
flower-wreathed head-lid. A palmist, a
string band and a sit-down tea were features
of the shivoo. The Best, Barrett and Bridges
dames were there (the latter with daughter
Babbie) ; also a group of Millses with the
Vivian Price widow, Mrs. John Gurner,
Mrs. Morrice Williams and her daughter
Gwynneth (who is shortly to marry a son of
Dr. Chisholm Ross, of Sydney). Mrs. Walter
Bayles convoyed a brace of daughters, and
looked as if she had resurrected Joseph’s
coat and topped it with a whole rooster
which had had an argument with a blue-
bag.
The Stork called at the Hildred Carliles’
home with a girl baby the other day. The
mother was Dora, second daughter of the
medical Weigalls. The. latter pair are much
pleased with their elegant new grandchild’s
sex, as they already possess a brace of
grandsons.
Mrs. Gravestock gave a tea-party at Men-
zies’ just before her return to Sydney.
Rosina Buckman and her Maurice were
guests, she a cool vision in black lace and
a pretence at sleeves. The hostess got a
great effect out of a rose-pink gown with
the last cry in sleeves of ruched Valenci-
ennes. Mrs. Alexander, of Sydney, blew in
to ; say good-bye in an ivory georgette frock
topped by a flamingo-feather hat. She and
her husband tour back to the Harbor in their
umpty-horsepower Packard round the coast
road. Another touring visitor was Mrs.
Lovett, in dove grey. She has just been
honeymooning, and came a-motoring down
from western N.S.AV.
Mrs. J. H. Robertson, in navy silk Lock-
ing, smiled from under a black lace drape
on her hat at her musical afternoon in the
Women’s Automobile Club parlors the other
day. The hostess herself, who, as Mabel
Reed, left the concert platform some years
ago to get married, lifted her rich contralto
in a brace of solos and a duet with mezzo
Mrs. Trythorne; Cliff Keat aired his tenor
and B. Sutcliffe his baritone, while Nathalie
Dawson was accompanist. Pianist Edith
Harrhy was there, and Mrs. Russel Gabb
rushed in from a lunch-party. Doris Moffat,
who is now partnering a pal in a private
hospital enterprise, handed round tea. In-
cidentally, as the Automobile Club runs to a
hired piano only, Cliff Keat is arranging
an evening of cards, music and dance at
Anzac House on Dec. 11 to start a fund to
pay for a baby grand.
Wee Georgie Wood will be back inside
12 months. The Manchester panto, he
has gone to play in is booked by the
J.C.W. firm for next Christmas, and
Wee Georgie has been engaged to come along
and make it go. He likes panto, work better
than playing Black-Hand George or the Boy
Scout. If it gives him, as he thinks it does,
a better opportunity to be amusing, the
pantos, written round his little self must be
funnier than the ones we have been accus-
tomed to. Probably they can’t help being
funny when the wee comedian has chief say
in the matter.
Here you have a Monteath picture of
Josie Melville, who is booked for the name
part of “Sally,” which the Firm will stage
early in the New
Year. Her success
is considered unpre-
cedented for an Aus-
tralian. Five years
ago she began as a
kiddy in “The House
that Jack Built,”
and successive pantos
found her still in the
background of the
chorus until the de-
parture of Maggie
Dickinson from a
spotlit position in
“Humpty Dumpty”
gave her a show.
She repeated the
other’s dances to such
effect that she was
booked to twinkle in
4<r¥ ,, . wv ivru tu L W 111 iiJ li 111
The■ 1 e e P Show.” From “The Peep Show”
to bally,” however, will be a great leap.
She modestly declares she doesn’t know
how she will shape, but George A.
Highland, who is tutoring her in the role,
swears she’ll be another fine advertisement
for the policy of recognising local talent.
The Ralph Falkiners will retain the home-
stead and 9000 acres of the Melville Forest
and Glendinning estate (Coleraine district)
now that the head of the house has sold the
other 43,000 acres, at £3 10s. an acre, to
the Closer Settlement Board, for farms for
45 officers retiring from the Indian Army.
The Board has mopped up a few other
estates, and is cogitating about some
more which are under offer. The ulti-
mate aim is to settle 500 of these
officers. Alan Currie (of Australia
Farms, Ltd.) has helped to snare the
majahs and the captings from India. The
new settlers are to have skilled guidance for
three years. They are a first-rate type, and
are confidently, relied on to maintain the
“tone” on which the Western District so
prides itself.
On Saturday the Broadmeadows Found-
ling Home’s iadies committee launched a
cafe chantant on the sun-bathed lawns of
Sebroff, Mrs. H. C. Webb’s homestead in
Armadale.. The Lady Mayoress said the
opening piece over a huge yellow presenta-
tion posy. Mrs. .Webb stood by in white
fluttery chiffon with a brown-and-gold mil-
linery f triumph on her head. Benjamin

Carew as assistant star; but Mona Magnet
blew in tow r ards the end and gave several
artistically-sung ditties. The Russel Gabbs’
two little girls in blue spent the time be-

morrow.
This is how Lafayette saw Mrs. Avery, the
popular Melbourne
matron who presides
over the Victorian
end of the many-
branched Home
Readers’ Union.
Herein the lady
s.eeketh to teach the
literary tastes of the
members to sprout
in a higher direction.
She is the mother of
Ermyntrude Avery,
a young pianiste who
conceived the excel-
lent idea of telling
children all about the
great composers,
with musical illus-
trations of their
works.
~Y ° ung Ronald Irving, the lengthy Briga-
dier-Generals son and heir, has just pre-
vailed on Violet, the elder daughter of the
Moonee Valley Hiskinses, to fix a matri-
monial date with him. The original Vic-
torian Irving, who passed out many years
ago, was a learned professor who head-
mastered the Hawthorn Grammar School.
Ills scholastic talents were inherited by his
daughters, who preside over the smart Mal-
vern ladies’ seminary, Lauriston.
Two of our leading lady golfists, Mrs.
Jimmy Gatehouse and Miss Mona McLeod,
packed up their clubs last week and left by
the Narkunda on Saturday in a swirl of
floral trophies, colored streamers and waving
handkies. Mrs. Jimmy will step off at
Colombo, where she is booked for a few
months’ stay, leaving Miss McLeod to con-
tinue the wet track to the Cold Land with
her devoted granny, Mrs. Knight.
The' South Yarra Lawn Tennis Club wel-
comed their visiting brothers and sisters of
the racquet at a cheery one-stepping frivol
m their swanky new clubhouse at the Toorak
end of Williams-road, which was decked out
in roses for the event. Music was made by
the Prince’s Club amateur orchestra, ail
the members of which are tennis enthusi-
asts as well as Old Melb. Grammar Boys.
Mrs. Lindley Baker, wife of the club vice-
president, acted as hostess, in shimmery
black brightened by a presentation posy of
damask roses, while H. H. Haynes, a live-
wire hon. sec., buzzed round on a non-stop
mission to see that no one yawned. All the
inter-State feminine players were handed
beribboned hand posies from Mrs. Waxman,
mother of the Vic. lady captain, Mrs. Lister.
Mrs. Lance, who captained the Ma State
women, fluttered in misty blue ; Mrs. O’Dea,
from Adelaide, sported chiffon of the same
shade: and Mrs. Norman Brookes, who
danced with her husband, was brocaded
like an early Victorian sofa in red
and gold. Maudie Molesworth, daughter
of the late Judge, who was responsible for
the decorations, wrapped a blue scarf round
her party frock; and Miss Menz, a South
Australian player, whirled in all-black fix-
ings. Dr. Norman McArthur, a keen elubite,
brought his handsome wife, who sparkled in
jet veiling.
Thomas Baker, who founded the firm of
Baker and Rouse, from which Kodak (Aus-
tralasia) Pty., Ltd., developed, leaves Mel-
bourne at the beginning of February for an
extended overseas trip in search of health.
He goes with J. F. MacKeddie. one of the
best-known medicine-men of Collins-street
and a tower of strength at the Alfred Hos-
pital. A year or two back the Bakers
acquired the ancestral hall at Mornington
formerly owned by Major Charley Campbell!
and here the head of Kodak has had installed
a £2OOO electrically-driven organ, which is
the envy of the countryside.
P. W. Tewkesbury, just back from a
wander abroad, missed the Cup festivi-
ties. He was shut indoors in darkness be-
cause of a recurrence of some eye trouble
that put him out of action for weeks in
London. Tewkesbury, who spent a consider-
able time in Germany, speaks of an all-night
run in the train with a sleeping cabin-de-
luxe and other things to match the luxuri-
ance. The whole batch of tickets cost him
Bs. 6d. A bottle of the best champagne at
dinner ran into another half-crown, and in
Berlin he got fitted out with the nicest shoes
available for 7s. a pair. Most expensive—
for Germany. English visitors live luxuri-
ously at the best pubs for ss. a day, and
they can practically buy a motor for what
a day’s hire would cost them in their own
country. Tewkesbury left his son in
America, studying the wool-buying business.
The rest of the family—his wife and
daughter—rushed off to Monte Carlo for
more excitement, whilst he, having had as
much as he could stand of furrin’ places,
dived for home.
Architect E. J. Clark, with his wife and
daughter Joyce, returned to Australia by
the Sonoma after a trip to see for himself
what is happening in the architectural world
in Europe, Great Britain and America.
Clark was the architect for the new Mel-
bourne Hospital buildings, which he finished
just after the war. The family trio are
paying a visit to Brisbane before returning
to Melbourne.
W. T. Manifold left one-sixth of his sub-
stantial estate to Trinity College at the
’Varsity. One-half the bequest (the exact
amount of which is not yet known) is for the
hostel known as the Janet Clarke Hall, but
subject to the condition that it be made a
regulation of the establishment that each
student shall strive for a diploma or certifi-
cate in domestic ecqnomy. It was a wise
head that suggested that proviso.
Melbourne Shakspeare Society is early in
the field with its annual breaking-up. Prizes
will be handed out at the Masonic Hall on
Friday of next week, when the rest of the
entertainment will be musical and dramatic,
as usual.
The Ministering Children’s League make
an annual excursion to their Cottage-
by-the-Sea at Queenscliff. This year
the party will be on December 2, when a
special boat will be chartered, and picnic
afternoon-tea will be turned on. During the
afternoon the St. Kilda Ward at the Cottage
will be officially opened by Mrs. Swanson.
By the way, a new playroom has been fin-
ished at the Cottage. It was erected in
memory of the late secretary, Mrs. Tlios.
Harrison.
popular dance-teaching experts, Mrs.
William Green and her daughter Florrie, will
brighten the Town Hall on the evening of
December 11 with their umpteenth kiddies’
fancy ball and entertainment, under the
patronage of both our vice-regal houses.
This year the Limbless Soldiers’ Association,
the Benevolent Asylum and St. Vincent’s
Hospital are to benefit by the brilliant dis-
play of juvenile talent.
W. M. Williams, one of the Senate candi-
dates in the Speck, is one of the many Hobart
men who have made their pile in the rag
business. Over 30 years ago he began in
a very small way, specialising in gloves,
which in those days were mostly of the kid
persuasion, and he eventually owned one of
the finest drapery shops in the city. Several
years back he retired. Williams has twice
been Mayor of Hobart, has represented it
in the Leg. Council, is a pillar of the Metho-
dist Church, and has made three matri-
monial ventures.
Some Adelaide gossip:—
Ihe polo season was opened with due pomp at
Birkalla the other day, when Airs. Gordon Law Smith
hostessed the afternoon-tea, and her lord and master
presented a silver cup to each member of the winning
team. Most of the hunting and polo fraternity were
there —the Cecil Brays (with daughter No. 2 almost
grown up), Mrs. Raymond Owen and a sister-in-law
over from Melbourne on a visit, Mrs. Lance Lewis, A.
G. Fenner with his growing-up son and grown-up
daughter, Mrs. Geoffrey and Mrs. Kenneth Duffield,
Mrs. Guy Makin, Mrs. George Braund and Mrs.
Hugh Crawford.
Meanwhile the youngest set was having it all its
own way at a party at Mrs. Leonard Bakewell’s —an
affair for children (50 or so of them), with a few
proud mammas thrown in, among the balloons, bran-
pies, paper-caps and other boredom-banishers.
The Women’s Club, a comparatively new venture
launched by the Y.W.IC.A., and afterwards handed
over to the city’s business women to run for them-
selves, is out after mote money and more members.
With an eye on the former commodity it organised
a fete, which was duly opened by its president, Miss
Adelaide Meithke. In the war years this lady proved
herself an indefatigable money-raiser, and if she can
infuse some of the energy she put into her war-
work into the club, the venture should boom.
Mayoress Cohen and her daughter have gone
a-jaunting to Melbourne, where his Gaudship is to join
them when he can find a blank day or two in his list
of engagements.
The Bach Society, the S. Aus. Orchestra and the
Tramways Band, with W, H. Foote as conductor, com-
bined for a performance of the “Messiah” in the Ex-
hibition, and made a wonderful performance of it.
Helene Taylor, Hilda Gill, F. Stone and Gordon James
were the soloists, and Sylvia Whitington was leader of
the orchestra.

CHEVROLET
FOR. ECONOMICAL TRANSPORTATION
agHE CHEVROLET “490” completely
% equipped, is the most economical car
that money and brains have yet
produced.
But it is not only on price that Chevrolet
has attained sales leadership in the “fully-
equipped” class.
Many who can afford the most expensive
cars are to-day choosing Chevrolet. They
realise it renders the same service—with
ample power, speed, stamina and style —as
cars costing much more to buy and to run.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
MICK SIMMONS [?] SPORTING NEEDS
After scoring 360 (their highest to date)
and getting a lead of 159 on the first innings,
Maeiaren’s cricketers failed by five wickets to defeat
a strong N. S. Wales side. But they gave an inter-
ested crowd a good run for its money. Winning the
toss for the third time in four matches, they had
first use of an excellent wicket, and looked like going
cheaply when two wickets were down for 33. Then
the small Titchmarsh and the tall Chapman put on
148 for the third wicket. Chapman got a brilliant
100 in 77min., thanks chiefly to powerful square cuts
and skimming cover drives. Titchmarsh plugged
along for a methodical but useful 79. Maclaren
showed a lot of his old skill in getting 54, albeit he
was very tired towards the close. The 360 were made
in 4J hours’ batting. Hendry (4 for 64) and Kelle-
way (4 for 81) did most of the damage, and Old-
field’s wicket-keeping was excellent.
N.S.W. crashed for 201. Macartney got a dashing
63 (in 54min.) and looked like staying for ever,
until Tyldesley caught him grandly off his own
bowling. Andrews weighed in with an elegant 86
in 30m1n., and Kippax contributed a neat 34. But
H. TYLDESLEY, the Lancashire slow-
bowler with Maclaren’s team.
nobody else did much, and the last four wickets fell
for 10 runs. Brand, a lofty right-hander with an
easy style and a perfect iength, took 4 for 43,
Tyldesley 3 for 47, and Freeman 2 for 41. Chap-
man’s fielding at cover-point was great. He was as
quick on his feet as a cat, and every ball that came
near him he gathered in with his safe hands. Waiv-
ing his right to make N. S. Wales follow on, the
M.C.C. captain sent his men in again, with unfor-
tunate results. Only Maclaren himself (28 not out),
Chapman (24), Calthorpe (21) and Titchmarsh (17),
did anything; the rest failed horribly and the 10th
wicket was skittled at 121. Aggin Kelleway (4 for
39) and Hendry (2 for 48) did the bulk of the bowl-
ing; and Mailey (2 for 17) and Macartney (2 for
8) helped in the latter stages. With 281 to get and
all day to do it in, N.S.W. knocked up the runs
in a little over three hours. Bardsley (7) and Col-
lins (22) were out early, but Macartney (84) and
Andrews (74) flogged the M.C.C. bowling unmerci-
fully, and Kippax (41) and Kelleway (82) com-
pleted the job. The match was played in a fine
sporting spirit, and was entertaining from first to
last.
* * * *
“Midlander”: W. G. Quaife, the great
little Birmingham batsman, who was here with
Maclaren’s team in 1901-02, is not quite a front-
ranker now—he was 50 last March—but he duly
piled up his 1000 runs again during the past season.
This is the 21st time he has done it, and nobody else
except W. G. Grace has equalled that record. His
best year was 1905, when he reached the 2000.
Standing only sft. iin., Quaife is possibly the small-
est man that ever reached international honors. He
first came into prominence in 1898, when for a fort-
night or so nobody could get him out at all. He
moved on from one not-out innings to another —six
of them—and had totalled 471 before his wicket fell.
Then Sussex, which had cast him out as being too
small for first-class cricket, felt sorry; but Warwick-
shire had by that time acquired him by residence,
and has kept him ever since. He and Dick Lilley,
the international wicket-keeper, run a sports depot
in Birmingham.
“T. 0.1.”: I witnessed the arrival of the
first (Stephenson’s) English XI in Australia at
Melbourne on Christmas Eve, 1861. On landing at
Sandridge railway pier they were met by Spiers and
Bond with one of Cobb’s coaches, drawn by six
grevs. and driven to the Cafe de Paris, attached to
the Theatre Royal in Bourke-street. Spiers and
Pond provided each man with a white hat, and enter-
tained them royally. The first match, against 18
Victorians, was played at Melbourne Cricket Ground
on January 1,2, 3 and 4, 1862, and the XI won
easily. There were 30,000 spectators each day. Two
of the team, Bill Caft'yn and Charles Lawrence, ie-
mained in Australia. Caffyn only for a time; Law-
rence for all time.
» * # •
“Winkle”: Dr. Hartkopf—he is a fashion-
able medico at Northcote (Vic.) —had a wonderful
athletic career until his professional duties cut it short.
Starting at Scotch College when a boy he won the
under-10-years title two years running, and then
the under-12 and the under-14. In 1908 lie was track
champion of that college, and in 1909, at the annual
sports, he won every event in a large programme
except the mile, in which he did not start. A fort-
night later, at the public schools, he won the 100yds.
(10 3-ssec., a record at that date), the 220yds.
(23 2-ssec.), the 440yds. (51sec., still the record), the
long jump (20ft. 6Jin.), and putting the shot
(34ft.). He was in the cricket XI from 1903 to
1909, captain in 1908 and 1909, and in both these
seasons scored 1000 runs and took 100 wickets. He
was also in the “Scotch” football team from 1904
to 1909 (captain in the last year), a member of
the rowing crew when they were head of the river,
and one of the tennis four in 1907-8-9. Hartkopf is,
without doubt, the greatest all-round athlete the
Viotorian public schools have turned out. When he
went to the University he gained his triple blue—
running, cricket, football—in his first year. His
success at pennant cricket was sudden. In
1906-7-8-9 he played for Fitzroy and won both the
batting and bowling averages in his first year, and
now he is the mainstay of the Northcote club. He
played League football with Uni. in 1908 and 1909,
and proved himself a champion in the best company,
until an accident to his knee put him out of the
game. In 1910 he won the 440yds. championship of
Victoria. On one occasion, when he was coming
out to train for that event, Mick Terry, Jack Donald-
son’s trainer, remarked to a friend, “What’s that
fellow doing here? I’ll bet he can’t run—he’s built
like a ploughman.” But when “Harty” got into his
stride Mick took it all back.
* * * *
Hartkopf has benefited by his outing
against the Englishmen in Melbourne. Playing fer
Northcote against P’ran on Saturday, he took 9 for
74 out of a total knock of 185, to which Willis con-
tributed 69. Willis made his tuns by unusually
solemn cricket, his score occupying over two hours.
’Cote are now in a promising position with none foi
31. A more exhilarating game was seen on the
M.C.C. ground, where the Red and Blues amassed 378
for 3 against Collingwood in an afternoon’s play.
Ransford, Vaughan and Sandford were responsible for
the triumph. The first two are 136 and 106 n.o. and
Sandford hit up 96 before he was run out. Another
century-maker was Hotchin, now 119 n.o. for St.
Kilda against North Melbourne. However, Ferguson
(63) was the only other seasider to show well with
the willow, so the aggregate of 9 for 233 is rather
depressing in the circumstances. Lampard, Cohen
and Ponsford, usually reliable bats for Saints, .started
an egg-laying competition. Allison, 135 n. 0., and
AVoodfull, 69, saved South Melbourne from being
spurned as hopeless amateurs at Richmond. South
are now in a good position with 6 for 276. In Fitz-
roy’s 9 for 202 against Carlton there were no purple
patches, Bates getting 79 and Liddicut 55 by careful
cricket. University knocked off with 5 for 209
against Essendon. Here again Irvine (74 n. 0.) and
Freemantle (72) saved a fluttering side from disaster.
* * * *
“Adelaide”: The talk about prominent
people whose names began with the letter Z (B.
16/11/’22) recalls the only occasion where there was
one on each side in a first-class cricket match. It
was when the South Africans were here in 1910:
Zulch for the visitors, Zschorn for South Oss.
* * * *
“U.P.”: According to his fatherly custom,
veteran George Giffen is coaching a dozen young-
sters on the Adelaide parklands. He gives them
an hour’s instruction, which begins punctually at
6 a.m., before going to his work at the G.P.O. The
old champion’s ambition is to produce another inter-
national, and there are one or two likely ones in
the flock.
* * -St #
The next English XI will come along in
1924-25, and an Australian team will return the visit
in 1926. The Board of Control wanted the Eng-
lishmen in 1923-24, but the M.C.C. wouldn’t have it.
• * • •
“J.H.” (London) : Australia and M.L.
are making a brave show in British Rugger. This
is nothing new, of course, for Howard Bullock, Colin
Gilray, little Maepherson, “Rastus” Adams, “Len’'
Brown (now Australian representative on the English
Rugby Union and a thriving eye, ear, nose and throat
specialist in the West Erd) and “Jerry” Portus
have done great things. Those fine players have
worthy successors in li. R. J. Saxon (M.L.) at Cam-
bridge last year and the year before, R. H. Betting-
ton (1920) and H. H. Porsayth (1920-21) at Oxford
(Porsayth, of course, has also played full-back for
Scotland for the last three seasons), and A. W. L.
Row and T. Lawton (Q.), also at Oxford last year.
Porsayth, Row and Lawton are likewise regular mem-
bers of the famous “Heathens” (Blackheath), about
the most consistent and powerful of all the big Lon-
don clubs. This season, at both ’Varsities, competi-
tion for the coveted Blue is fiercer than ever; but
when the two fifteens face each other at Twickenham
early in December Australia and M.L. will once
more “be there.” Lawton is playing better than
ever, and if A. C. (“John”) Wallace (Sydney Gram-
mar, Sydney ’Varsity and N.S.W.) and George Aitken
(the M.L. captain and centre) show anything like
their overseas form it’s extremely unlikely that either
will be missing from the Oxford XV. And there are
others. Dick Windeyer has a son, G. S. Windeyer,
who has been going great guns in the Cambridge
trial matches, and is a hefty and promising forward.
He has just come up to Cambridge from the Royal
Naval College at Greenwich. A Maorilander also in
the running for the Light Blue XV is 11. S II
Giliver (Wellington). I should add that Wallace
has already been invited to play for Blackheath,
and that Porsayth, having left Oxford, is now the
Blackheath full-back.
* -* » »
At least two members of the Hughes
Cabinet can look back to an athletic past. Trea-
surer Bruce was a member of the Cambridge crew
in an Oxford-Canibridge boatrace; and Granville
Ryrie, Assistai t-Minister for Defence, won the ama-
teur heavyweight championship of N. S. Wales on
several occasions. When the Stadium was opened at
Belah (the Light Horse rest-camp at Palestine) Ryrie
challenged Charlie Cox to put them on with him to
decide who was the best boxer among the generals.
He got the verdict without a battle. The two old
campaigners would have been the final pair in a
popularity contest, too; but Brig. Ryrie would have
won again.

The last meeting under proprietary control
at Warwick Farm (N.S.W.) will be favorably remem-
bered by punters. There were seven races on the
card, ( and four favorites got home. One of them was
the “pommy” horse, Cymric, who has come good at
last. Two third-raters, in Wirrimah and Buekra,
were backed to beat him over 1 mile 2) furlongs,
but he settled them in a hollow fashion. Before he
is through with the turf Cymric will win better races
than £2OO suburban handicaps.

or thereabouts, the handsome stranger wasn’t pro-
duced on an Australian racecourse until he had been
properly acclimatised. Then he was started in a
six-furlong race at the W.A.T.C. course, was solidly
backed at starting-price (by someone, if not by the
stable), and couldn’t go slow enough for the oppo-
sition. He is expected to take Easingwold’s place
as W.A. champion. That overworked chestnut is
having a short rest at Mordialloc (Vic.), prior to
being put in work for the Newmarket, or, it may
be, for the Doncaster at Easter.
E. G. Sutherland, who recently shifted
from Maoriland to the land of the ’Bok, has won the
S’Afriean high-jump championship with the record
leap of 6ft. He was also first with the 161 b. shot
(34ft. lOin.) and finished second in the 120yds.
hurdles. The climate must suit the Maorilander,
for his feats eclipse anything done by him in Aus-
tralasia. J. K. Ayres-Oosterlaak was an absentee, and
the best J. W. BukeS could do was to finish second
to G. Dustin in the 220yds. in 22 l-ssec.

Unless plans miscarry, a party of Yankee
athletes will swoop down on Maoriland in January.
Paddock, the record-smasher, is among them. He
may come on to Sydney and meet “Slip” Carr, who
is running the hundred in even time with monoto-
nous regularity.

Alan Charlton, the 15-year-old Manly
(N.S.W.) swimmer, got over 200yds. on Saturday in
2min. IBsec., which is only 4 2-ssee. outside the best
time recorded by Barney Kieran. The brand of the
coming champion is on Charlton if he doesn’t get

“Push On” : In the Australian crawl stroke
(B. 23/11/’22) you use the left leg in conjunction
with the right-arm pull, and the right leg with the
left-arm pull. Chris. Daniells worked the legs
independently, thus blundering upon a stroke which
with some slight modifications is now recognised as
the Yankee trudgeon-crawl. It is an admirable
method in smooth water, but its superiority has been
exaggerated. Prank Beaurepaire is a trudgeon dis-
ciple, and, at 31, his mile record has still to be
wiped out by such as Ross and Weissmuller, who
are years younger and stones heavier. The Americans
have made sciences of coaching and training, and
that is why they score. Massage, a fetich with the
Yanks, is rarely indulged in by our swimmers.
Weissmuller wasn’t allowed to go surfboard-riding
at Honolulu because bis trainer reckoned it might
be detrimental to his competition swimming. Can
you figure that happening to an Australian champ?

There were no surprises in the champion-
ship tennis finals in Melbourne. For the fourth vear
in succession Patterson lifted the singles, the chal-
lenger again being Ilawkes, who, after dropping two
sets, brilliantly captured the third at 6—2, and pushed
the champion in the fourth to 5—7. Neither Patter-
son nor Hawkes had been tuned up by any fierce
opposition in the preliminaries. In fact, their pro-
gress was so easy that any player who snatched a sat
from either was invested with a sudden distinction.
Wherefore young Hone, of South Australia, who un-
doubtedly outplayed Patterson in one set, attained
awesome grandeur beside the colts who managed to
get one or two games in each chapter by expending
energy on the big fellow’s backhand. Mclnnes, who
faced Patterson in the semi-final, did much better
work, to be sure, and there was a great deal in his
achievement in moving up from o—s to 6—B in the
most sensational session of the match. After his tiring
struggle wdth Patterson, Hawkes was not bright enough
to partner Miss Boyd in the final of the mixed
doubles against two such seasoned players.as O’Hara
Wood and Mrs. Lister. Yet Hawkes und his buxom
friend ran away with the first set (6—o), and were
on the verge of an exciting triumph at 5 —2 when
Wood and Mrs. Lister emerged from their trance
and started to concentrate on the rapidly-wearying
youth, eventually seizing the set at 12—10 after a
valiant effort by Miss Boyd to save the situation,
lhe next set Wood and Mrs. Lister secured by the
easier margin of 6—3,
and retained the trophy
for another year, though
on the aggregate of games
they were down by one.
Hawkes had to make still
another appearance with
Patterson in the doubles,
and the win was practi-
cally due to Patterson, the
Geelong lad, who was pro-
bably dead beat, contri-
buting the majority of
nets and outs. The
enemy, Rainey and i'it-
chett, are only first-pen-
nant players, anyhow, and
their lack of paice in ser-
vice was a considerable
factor in their defeat.
Veteran L. N.
RAINEY (Vie.),

the Melbourne
tournament.
Linesman : Looking at Gerald Patter-
son after his return from England one must admit
that lie has benefited by the change. He is still in-
clined to net with half-court crashes, but generally
he is surer and less spectacular overhead, and he Isas
perfected a sliced backhand volley that adds greatly
to his offensiveness in singles. His forehand drive,
loaded with the overspin that gives it a disconcerting
drop when it seems bent on a headlong journey out-
side, is now more strongly controlled as regards
direction, whereas a backhand shot of a like calibre
is absent, with the result that lie is still running
round in the old school-girl fashion to punch back
a backhand ball from the forehand position. More-
over, his bad habit is becoming contagions, for one
notices Hawkes performing the same feat, quite re-
gardless of the fact that he is laying up for himself
a store of trouble if he; ever has to tackle the Yankees
for the Davis Cup. This lazy avoidance of the back-
hand, conspicuous in Patterson, and sufficiently
noticeable in Anderson, Hawkes and Wood to warrant
misgiving's regarding the future, has simply come
about in Australia through the inability of any man
to exploit tlie Weakness. If a player of the all-round
brilliance of Tilden were to appear here, he would
be a godsend to tennis, for he would compel; the!
slackhanders to plug up the hole in their arnujjr. As
it is, none of our topnotchers worry about the back-
hand game, well knowing that there is no one in sight
in Australia competent enough to win a match on it.
Tilden, who, according to Patterson, is actually
stronger on his backhand than on his forehand, reck-
oned that all the Australians he had seen were liable
to “blow up” under a persistent backhand attack.
* * * *
“15-30”: The Melbourne tennis tourna-
ment brought forward a promising player in Miss
Kelpie, who shares with Mrs. Lister the distinction
of possessing good looks as well as brains. Miss
Kelpie is refreshingly free from the orthodox pat-
like playing which makes the average tennis tabby
so wearisome to watch. Though comparatively crude
in courtcraft, she has strokes that only need to be
developed by practice in good company to riddle
the defences of the staid and unpicturesque spinsters
whose safe work gets them into semi-finals. The
girl’s backhand slam across court, or straight down
the sideline, was one of the finest shots I saw
during the tournament. It didn’t always come off,
but in pace, strength and low trajectory it would
be something for even Patterson to be proud of, if
he were given to backhand offensives. Also her first
service had an unfemitiine punch about it that will
win her handfuls of aces when it is two or three
years older. Just now it is a little unreliable, like
her forehand drive, but unquestionably it did great
work, scoring repeatedly against men in the mixed
doubles, in which she lost early owing to the bad
strategy and placements of an indifferent partner.
* * * *
“Wilfrido” : Arthur Brooks, M.L.’s open golf
champion, who has a 66 to his credit on a 76
bogey course, put in an end-season score of 62 on
the same links. It consisted of four 2’s, five 3’s,
six 4’s and three s’s. Brooks, a small Englishman
who served in the Great Push, has a medium drive
and an unfailing mashie.

Sammy Mossberg, of New York, is game
and strong, but he always looked a loser against
Hughie Dwyer at the Sydney Stadium on Saturday,
night. Although Dwyer didn’t show up as well as'
when he won the lightweight title from Godfrey,
he knew too much for Samuel, Incidentally, he
landed more than one low punch. Mossberg did not
squeal, however, but fought back in a fair and fear-
less manner that won him admiration, if not dahlars.
In the third round, Dwyer pressed a snappy right on
Mossberg’s chin, and had the visitor practically at
his mercy, but was unable to place the deciding
punch. The dazed American recovered and gave back
almost as much as he received. It was Mossberg’s
first 20-rounder. He should do better next time.

“Snow”: That par about old “Snowy”
Sturgeon (B. 9/11/’22) called up memories of his
hair-raising fight with Otto Cribb. About half-way
through each boxer let go a terrific right swing.
Both blows got home, and down went the two war-
riors as if shot. “Snowy,” who had fallen in the
centre of the ring, was still there when the 10 seconds
had been cheeked off, while Cribb, who had dropped
close to the ropes, just managed x to drag himself to
his feet by their aid before the “out” signal was
hoisted. We had some great welters and middle-
weights in those days, and the game would»be a
lot better for & few of their like now. But these
times the preference is all for feather-pillow fedders,
and the darker they are the better they are liked.
“J.H.” (London) : I saw the Beckett-
Moran scrap at the Albert Hall. Moran is 38 and
a hopeless back-number. Beckett is a mere slogger,
without a true?; of science—an absolute gift for a
quick thinker, like Carpentier, or any of the younger
third-rate Americans. There are only two real
fighters in England to-day: Kid Lewis and Jimmy
Wilde. Had Les Darcy lived what a harvest' he
would have gathered in Cockaigne!
A GREGORIAN CHANT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The great question of the hour is: Where are we
going to find another Gregory?... .One does not dare
to contemplate what an English Test side would do
with the present N.S.W. bowling.”— Daily Tele-
graph critic after the match against ilaclaren’s team.
What is the problem men debate
With growing doubt or rising rage?
Is it —could Charlton legislate
As well as Billy Hughes?—or Page?
Is Oscar Asehe upon the stage
A Henry Irving or a Tree?
Ah, no! The question of the age
Is where to find a Gregory.
The politicians go and come,
And attitudinise and yap;
’Twixt Tweed ledee and Tweedledum
Of real diff. there isn’t a scrap;
Whether they’re on or off the map
It matters not a tinker’s d.
The trouble is we haven’t a chap
To skittle stumps like Gregory.
Look where you will, on every hand
Are packs of patriots revealed,
All guaranteed to save the land
In council hall or tented field.
But when the foemen willows wield
Our demon bowler—where is lie?
How can we win the Sheffield Shield
This year without a Gregory?
Macartney picks them off his toes
For fours, and lusty Andrews thumps.
But doubts intrude if Mailey’s slows
Will reasonably oft be trumps.
The cricket fans are in the dumps.
Come, let us pray on bended knee—
To smash this way and that the stumps,
Lord, send another Gregory 1

“Digger’s Batman” : The authorities have
given the move-on order to the German gun
at Sydney Railway Station. And, in the
meantime, no one, barring a suburban coun-
cil, which declines to pay cartage, is
willing to provide the obstruction with
a home. The temperamental Tom
’Enley—an A.I.F. underclothing colonel
—is maddened at the affair, regarding it as
an insult to himself and his fellow-warriors.
Another and more frequent type of Digger,
on the other hand, finds the reluctance to pro-
vide quarters for a captured enemy cannon
less scandalous than the widespread disin-
clination to employ the men who helped to
secure such weapons. It’s all in the point
of view.
“Satan”: “O.K.’s” appreciation of Georgie
Wood (B. 9/11/’22) reminds me of a re-
moter Bulletin par, in which it was laid
down that juvenile prodigies never developed
into adult geniuses, Amy Rozelle’s brother
being instanced as a case in point. Young
Rozelle was an undoubted juvenile prodigy,
but when about 13 he absolutely stopped
growing. Physicians were consulted but
without avail. Nothing could be done, and
he remained a dwarf for the rest of his life.
Developing normally in other respects, the
man was artist enough to have become a
Little Tich of the “legit.,” but, being acutely
sensitive, this was utterly repugnant to him.
I remember him in middle-age—a polished,
perfectly-proportioned little gentleman, who
painted and taught drawing. His sister Amy
grew into a handsome woman with the fine
physique demanded of a leading lady.
“Harold Hardupp” on woman, the stra-
tegist :
A parcel of hilarious youths were partaking of sup-
per the other night at one of Sydney’s late-hour
restaurants. They had got over the difficulty of
obtaining beer by bringing it with them, in generous
quantities, and had obviously outstayed their wel-
come. Vainly Theophilus Steakadeoyst appealed to
them to disperse and let him close his emporium;
They merely scoffed and hiccoughed their intention
of remaining till the last bottle was buzzed. They
were still jeering at the distressed Hellene when
the Contessa Steakadeoyst arrived, and, regarding them
with the disdainful air of a refined person in the
presence of an obnoxious smell, announced that she
had collected their coats, hats, sticks and other im-
pedimenta, and placed them on the pavement outside.
If they didn’t claim them soon, there was no knowing
what mightn’t happen to them. A couple of night
prowlers and three dogs were already investigat-
ing——- There was an apprehensive rush for the
street door on the part of the undesired patrons, and
inside two minutes it banged behind the last member
of the tumultuous procession.
“Norbell’s” fond memories :—■
“Stargazer’s” verse, “The Australian Drama,” (B.
16/11/’22), awakes memories. “No one ever gets a
drink of dinkum beer,” he sings. But sometimes
one does. Alfred Dampier used to provide the
real Mackay. Playing with him at the old
“Alec” (now H. M. Theatre), Melbourne, one Cup
night, several of us had to swallow life-size pewters
of beer and then have a drunken brawl, during
which 1 had to be outed. Of course we’d all been
to Flemington, and my opponent had had a win
and previous pots. The brawl scene was very real-
istic. I stopped a beautiful uppercut and took the
full count (immense applause) and was dragged
off by the heel 3, while the winner was with difficulty
restrained from fighting the whole stageful, Dampier
included. George Musgrove was another manager
who gave us the dinkum oil, even at rehearsal. Once
I played in a temperance drama. Charlie Mortyne,
an excellent actor, was the shocking example who
reforms at the death knock. When he was handed
a flask of brandy in the last act he had to hurl it
from him in pious renunciation. One night we
filled the flask with real firewater to see what
Charlie would do- —he didn’t believe in wasting good
liquor. He seized the flask, sniffed at it, “took the
stage” and exclaimed, “No ! Heaven helping me,
I’ll never touch another drop of dr-r-rink as long
as ever I live!” But instead of smashing the bottle
to smithereens, he carefully put it in his pocket.
When the rag fell the s.m. roared, “Mortyne, you’ve
ruined the show!” The graceless Charlie produced
his flask and retorted, with a grin, “But I can still
show the ruin!”
“The Deacon”: I nominate Tom Buckley,
Irish piper and comedian, for the Veteran
Actor Stakes (B. 16/11/’22). Thomas, who
is S 5 years young, has just finished a strenu-
ous season in South Africa with Allen
Doone. Beyond the fact that it takes him
a day or two longer to learn a part now
than it did 70-odd .years ago, this youth is
as vigorous as of yore, and playing better
than ever.
THE BABE AT THE PLAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Rev. G. L. Buckley, M.A., said he believed in
taking children to the theatre, especially when there
were plays of a high standard presented. In his
view anything from Shakspeare to the ‘Merry Widow’
was worth taking them to see.” —Report of Secondary
Schools Conference, Melbourne.
We took our baby to the play.
A five-year-old is she.
At that delightful matinee
The Merry Widow we
Had come to see.
The questions she chose to ask
Imposed on us a fearful task.
The little darling wished to know
The very things she shouldn’t;
She asked me testily to show
The things I really couldn’t,
And surely wouldn’t,
And further to incense the crowd,
Quite frequently she squealed aloud.
“Why is the lady doing this?”
She asked in accents clear.
For every question asked, our miss
Had all the house to hear.
She laughed: “My dear,
Do look at that poor girl. I guess
Some wicked man lias stole her dress.”
And then, seized with another whim,
Just as the chorus fled,
She cried: “They’ve gone to have a swim!”
And more the baby said.
Much did I dread
The question I failed to drown:
“Papa, dear, who will rub them down?”
Let other fathers take the child
To see this type of play,
For I was almost driven wild
By Rosalind that day,
And came away
To hear my five-year-old complain;
“I’ll never take you out again!”

THE COUNCIL OF ACTION’S LITTLE GAME.
THE MAN AT THE WINDOW: “Whichever wins that game, there can only be one loser—and that’s mef*
The Australian Labor Party has completely
changed its objective and outlook. At the Inter-
State A.L.P. Conference in Brisbane, in October,
1921, it adopted the Soviet doctrine of Social-
isation of industries and the formation of a
Supreme Economic Council. Mr. Theodore,
Labor Premier of Queensland, frankly stated at
the Conference: —
“YOU HAVE CHANGED THE OBJEC-
TIVE. YOU MIGHT AS WELL CHANGE
THE NAME OF THE PARTY, AND CALL
IT THE COMMUNIST PARTY.”
The Council of Action, appointed in con-
nection with the new Communist policy, has
been engaged in its devilish work during the past
few weeks in promoting irritation strikes, in
encouraging Go-Slow, and in other steps to
introduce its objective of industrial chaos and
Social Revolution.
The N.S.W. Trades and Labor Council is
affiliated with the “Red” International organisa-
tion, whose headquarters are at Moscow, and
there is a close connection between the Russian
Sovietists and the Australian Sovietists.
This dangerous movement is aiming a deadly
blow at organised Labor as well as at every
other section of the community.
No protest has been uttered by Australian
Labor leaders against the revolutionary senti-
ments which have been expressed by these
international extremists. The reason is plain.
They are bound by their Soviet platform. They
are dominated by the revolutionary Communists.
The only safe course is to support the National
Party, which is irrevocably opposed to these
insidious doctrines; which has reduced taxation;
which has steered the ship of State through the
difficulties of the past, and guarantees sound
government and a fair deal for every class in
the years ahead.
For Safety First Vote Nationalist
and No Sovietism.

When the Lord Chamberlain vetoed the
original name bestowed on Oscar Asche’s
“Cairo,” on the ground that it might grate
upon Mohammedan susceptibilities, he de-
prived the song, “Hast Thou Been to
Mecca?” of a certain part of its force. Any-
how, after to-morrow week, no pilgrimage to
Cairo (or Mecca) will be feasible for the
Sydney playgoer. “The stars are setting,
and the caravan” —loads up for Melbourne

At Sydney Theatre Royal “The Naughty

-“The Silver Fox,” with its company of
five and its flavor of the French feuilleton,

perhaps a tribute to the acting that no

The magic names of Lee White and Clay
Smith are again blazing over the outer por-
tal of Sydney Tivoli. Herbert la Martine
and Teddy Sherry provide something new in
the jazz line. May Sherrard is refreshing
in old-time pieces with a Cockney flavor,
while Leonard Nelson delivers the goods in
a manner which is exasperatingly his own.
Apdale’s performing animals carry on as if
they liked it, though S.P.C.A. experts aver
that they don’t, and many other things into
the bargain. Hunter and Bob are well in
the picture, and the stolid Bertini continues
to hover between the inept and the classical
in his violin-playing.
I’ or the Defence,” at Sydney Lyceum,
introduces an Indian hypnotist who was
destined to be the corpse from the word go,
and the usual eleventh-hour rescue. And then
there is Mary Miles Minter in “Don’t Call
Me Little Girl.” The Rialto is engaged in
being scornful of the idle rich, and at the
Majestic “The Wrong Woman” is causing
confusion and excitement. Katherine Mac-
donald and Mae Murray are running neck to
neck for popular favor at the II ay market.
William Farnum is at Hoyt’s in “Perjury.”
"Fool’s Paradise” is the Globe’s bait, and
the 'Strand relies on “Orphans of the Storm.”
And “The Prince of Lovers” is still at the
Palace.
Charles Bryant’s pictures at Horderns’
Gallery convey the impression that he is
usually more concerned to apply borrowed
formulae to each new subject than he is to
record the subject’s particular beauties. In
short, his attitude is essentially modern. Tike
19 out of 20 others, he wastes real ability
in the production of mediocre work, and
thereby contributes his quota to assist the

present decadence of art. Nature meant more
than method to him in “Camouflaged Ships”
(No. 48), “French Fishing Boats” (No. 53)
and “Toilers of the Deep” (No. 59), which
are his best and proof of his powers; but
it requires a considerable effort to forget

most of his other works.
From an Adelaide critic:—
At Preece’s Gallery is a show of 50-odd works
by Ida Rentoul Outhwaite, about equally divided
between water-color and black-and-white. They are
in the main a joyous collection of gnomes and
fairies; the more human among these are of a
strangely snub-nosed type, breathing the authen-
tic Peter Pan spirit. But there is behind
it all a strength one had not previously sus-
pected. Particularly in black-and-white. The heavy
trees have a gloomy and almost menacing air which
suggests sometimes S. H. Sime, and sometimes the
Dorg illustrations to Dante. The lady is pretty
certainly destined to do more important work in the
near future.
A theatrical note from Adelaide :
Alec Melrose, a local lawyer—as he appeared in
person on the stage and made a speech, the pen-
name of “Alex. Somerville” may be disregarded—
provided the whole programme for the final evening
of Adelaide Repertory Theatre’s season. “The
Prince Peter’s Half-mile” is a pleasant trifle of a
lover who won his lady’s heart by athletic prowess,
shown in a silver cup which he had in fact bought at
a pawnbroker’s. It contains some cheerful chaff about
Adelaide schools and personalities. “The Usual
Three” is stronger stuff. An author is writing about
the jaded problem of husband, wife and lover, when
he finds it present in his own home; but the other
man has a wife too, so the author makes love
to her. The eternal triangle has become a quadrangle
—with the accent on the wrangle, for the matter is
of dialogues extending over three acts. The theme,
very_ thoroughly talked over by all four, in a series
as old as Boccaccio, is
quite decorously
treated. Melrose seems
to have taken Sardou
for his guide in con-
struction. Every-
thing fits in' neatly ;
for instance, a wife
improbably pushes the
husbands off the stage
when quarrelling, in
order that they may
be “discovered” later,
when a curtain is
suddenly drawn aside,
having a friendly
drink. With perhaps
a little more action
stirred in, Melrose’s
work should have a
chance on any stage.
His dialogue is bright
and natural, with a
literary flavor; as
where the husband de-
livers an epigram on
flirtation, and meets
his wife’s mocking “I
suppose you’ve just
made that up?” with
“I wish to God I had.
The phrase is Mere-
dith’s.”

having a east almost,
entirely distinct from, but fairly comparable with,
that of the Shaw-Barrie programme of a week earlier.
The company was reinforced for this occasion by Cyril
Mack-ay. Yet Ray Walsh, Ivy Stacey and Gwen Hone
fai.ly held their own with the professional. “Bobs”
Trevor, daughter of two fine players of the past, made
a. good first appearance in a character seemingly drawn
from the Parisian stage—the yoUng girl, a shrinking
flower according to her father, but in other company
conversing mainly in terms of “Chuck it” and
“Come off the roof.”
The opera season at Adelaide Royal ended with
a “Merry Widow” revival, in which Leslie Holland
at, last had a chance. lie is not the youthful song-
bird of the author’s intention, but sheer artistry
enabled him to “get away with it” successfully.

has suffered the loss of Madge
Elliott, but Beryl Ferguson is
a most presentable substitute.
Beryl makes the most of her
slim little warble, and her dia-
logue, delivered with a sophis-
ticated airiness in the cynical
places, comes with refreshing
clearness over the footlights.
Elsewhere the show continues to
move on many colored legs, and
the voice of W. S. Percy, ex-
pressing Love’s young scream
with a Gallic intonation, still
prevents the flymen falling
asleep at their posts. To the
ear of the present show re-
viewer Percy has grown more
vociferous since the opening
night. The top note of his
tumultuous passion must now
be pretty audible in Tasmania.
At Melbourne King’s, last week, Leslie
Gordon was put aside with laryngitis, where-
fore ’Erb’s rustic outfit has been transferred
to Jack Souter, who has not the effectual
shamble of his forerunner, and is less art-
lessly lugubrious over his blessed false teeth.
Another notable absentee from “The Bloke”
is the ladylike accent of Eileen Alexander,
who has ruffled her utterance to be more in
keeping with Bill’s gaudy articulation. How-
ever, she still maintains an unduly haughty
deportment. As for Bill, he remains the same
diverting example of loutish conversion,
though he is developing the deep-seated
husky undertone reminiscent of Bert Bailey
m a pathetic situation.

The Pioneer Players, who stage only ori-
ginal Australian works, will conclude their
first season with a Christmas bill of one-act
plays at Melb. Playhouse on December 18.
Seven dramatists have already been dragged
into the limelight, and two more will be
added to the list: Prank Brown, a sporting
scribe, who has travelled right through the
Northern Territory, and speaks pidgin-Eng-
lish like a native, and Monty Grover, the
editor of the Melbourne Sun, who supplies
a novel “costume” play, the romantic setting
being Bondi Beach.

Dickens continues to be massacred to
make a South-street holiday in “The Peeo
Show” at Melbourne Royal. Admirers of
the immortal author must have their finest
feelings wrenched by hearing a Bumble who
is nasally related to Bill Sikes and is other-
wise caricatured, in a slick Yankee manner.
J. H. Wakefield, who does the two narts, is
not at home as a Dickens interpreter. As an
assertive American millionaire who tucks
away his chew behind his shoe-heel, his real-
ism almost amounts to self-revelation.

well, indeed, that Phil Wirth will probably

Burr and Hope, the “modern Romeo and
Juliet” to. whom Shakspeare can still show
a few points, are appealing to the multi-
tude s eye and ear at Melbourne Tivoli this
week. Not less appealing in popular esti-
mation are dancers Eddie and Decima
McLean, who have returned with all their
old devil and agility. Billy Maloney, the
“Man . with the Silver Stick,” but whose
voice isn’t composed of the same metal, is
the latest comedian on the bill, whereon Will
Coilinson is also jesting nightly in a moder-
ate burlesque sketch, “’Enry’s ’Oliday.” But
Colleano, the wire-walker, deserves the big-
gest nosegay. He is unquestionably an
artist at his business.

Hoyt’s, Melbourne, are making a fuss of
“Nanook of the North.” an Esquimaux tale
which is a study in still life as movie yarns
go. “Step on It,” with Hoot Gibson as the
stepper, and “The Unfoldment,” a Bathe
production with scarcely a restful moment,
both invite the crowd to spend a pleasant
summer evening inside. The Majestic’s star
item is “The Sea Lion” (Hobart Bosworth)
who shows all the movie actor’s ambition to
wring the last drop of anguish and terror
out of a melodramatic rble. A milder dis-
turbance, “Made in Heaven,” affords Tom
Moore another opportunity to demonstrate
his beatific nature to a simple young thing.

A Melbourne critic speaks :
The general effect of Lionel Lindsay’s little collec-
tion of etchings and woodcuts at the Decoration
Gallery, Melbourne, is somewhat lowered by the
inclusion of two or three Spanish subjects, which are
more or less in the nature of dramatic illustrations
emphasising the importance of the human figure at
the expense of the design. Lindsay is really not so
good in plain etching as in mezzotint and aquatint.
The aquatint entitled “The Great Red Gum,” is a
delightful performance, far outstanding in merit
The Shanty on the Rise,” of which the whole edition
is alleged to have been sold out. But the attraction
of the latter is probably its touching appeal to
local sentiment, inasmuch as two swaggies are de-
picted ascending to a cool drink at the end of the
day. Two more deadbeats in the drypoint called
“Mates” have brought a crowd of connoisseurs quest-
ing for prints, though the pictorial interest is prac-
tically concentrated in the well-contrasted ancients
shuffling along the road. The treatment of the jum-
bucks in “Travelling Sheep” is rather careless, the
mass effect of the flock appearing forced. But there
is fine work in the mezzotint “Red Gums,” and
one feels, also, a partiality for “Old Bark Hut.” The
principal of four woodcuts is a portrait of the late
Henry Lawson, which is a good likeness, like the
drypoint of the poet elsewhere, but without a re-
deeming glint of laughter in his hard and challeng-
ing eye.
“S.T.S.”: The one line in “The Magis-
trate which has stuck in my mind is not
preserved in “The Boy.” It was an example
of the danger of a little learning. Said his
Worship, sitting in judgment on a fellow-
reveller : “You were taken in flagrante delic-
to —in flagrant delight.” The present age
doesn’t care for classical tags, and the joke
has gone.

“Orb”: “Pitt-streeter’s” quotation from a
New York paper concerning Marie Tempest
—-“In lighter mood she is still herself but as
an emotional actress she seems always an
actress —artificial in the extreme,” was in
my mind when I stumbled on this critique in
a 30-year-old N.Y. Life (Dec., ’93) :
Miss Marie Tempest and “The Algerians’’ have
moved over to Daly’s. It seems that Miss Tempest
might use her abilities to better advantage than
with such an opera, and perhaps better than in opera
at all. She has marked talent as a comedienne, and
it might not be a bad experiment for her to try
something in that line.
Marie is a trier anyhow.
“Cornstalk”: “Abe and Mawruss” (other-
wise Lee Kohlmar and Alexander Carr) are
appearing in a three-act comedy, entitled
“Partners Again,” at the Selwyn Theatre,
New York. In the cast are Louis Kimball,
who came out here on a six months’ engage-
ment to play in “Under Fire,” and stayed
just on four years; and Barney Ber-
nard, another old friend. Helen Lowell,
who was Miss Hazy in the Aus-
tralian performance of “Mrs. Wiggs of
the Cabbage Patch,” is showing in “The
Torch Bearers.” Thais Lawton is one of
“The Exciters.” Thais was Guy Bates
Post’s leading woman in the Commonwealth.
“L.E.”: Hugh J. Ward has received praise
for his patriotism in keeping an Australian
chorus instead of engaging girls from abroad.
But as all the good parts and good salaries
will go to imported artists, there doesn’t
seem much to be thankful for, especially as
the expense of bringing out a whole bunch
of girls from the other end of the globe would
be an item worthy of consideration. I have
seen a well-paid musical-comedy performer
who sang a little but had no voice to speak
of, who hopped about a bit but was no
dancer, and who spoke a few lines but wasn’t
very good at acting, and wondered why she
had been brought so far to do so little. But
it seems the average Australian girl is too
plain or too stupid, or has some impediment
in her speech or her ankles, ever to draw a
big salary or get any further than the first
line of the chorus.
On a noble victim of the movies:—
The pitcher in which Byron is portrayed as a
sheik is hopelessly untrue to the real Byronic char-
acter. Instead of being a prince of lovers, he
lived almost like an ascetii. He was usually starv-
ing himself to keep down his stoutness, as it was
painful, sometimes impossible, for him to walk if
he increased his weight even by a few pounds. He was
about the slowest man on earth, according to Tre-
lawney, who accompanied him to Greece after the
death of Shelley. Byron’s normal course of life was
to stagnate; and nothing could move him, except
some fair lady from whom he fled as from the
plague. He complained bitterly that all his life
women had pursued him. He tried for years to
escape the stout but persevering Guiccioli and her
husband, who insisted on coming with her, also her
brothers, but at last he had to yield. The family
was too strong for him. And he didn’t die on horse-
back, sword in hand, as romantic schoolboys imagine,
but of fever caught on a dirty little mud-island
where he had been camped for months, surrounded
by couriers, valets, diplomats, thieves and all kinds
of impedimenta, including-Greek patriots who came
to borrow from him. Most of his time he spent, not
in military operations, but in cursing the whole
muddled business. With all his faults, Byron had
much too great a hatred of sham ever to become a
moving-picture hero.

, “Second Murderer”: When Allan Wilkie
was doing “King John” at Sydney Palace,
his amiability made him an easy target for
scores of amateur authors, who mercilessly
fired their masterpieces at him. One per-
sistent youth dogged Wilkie to the T. and G.
flats, where he was staying, and managed
to invade his bedroom. Wilkie goodnaturedly
consented to let the dramatist read him a
scene from “Back from the Scaffold.” The
young man got going, and read impress-
ively, “As the robbers crawl in at the win-
dow the clock strikes one.” “Ah!” said
Wilkie. “Excellent! Which one?”
“O. Blin” : When the great Mountjoy Per-
kins did “Hamlet” at Gobblegutting he fol-
lowed the usual practice of stimulating his
genius at the pub. On the opening night
he was the most pickled Dane that the vil-
lage had ever seen, and the popular indigna-
tion was succinctly expressed in a couple of
lines in the Gobblegutting Guardian. Said
the gentle critic: “To beer or not to beer was
the question that was settled in the affirma-
tive at the Mechanics’ last night. It was
the actor this time who was carried away.”
“0.K.”: News that James Hay, the Gil-
bert and Sullivan opera tenor, has married
a diamond merchant’s widow worth £40,000
a year, will satisfy Australian friends who
found money for sending young Hay to
England some years ago. He did very
well when at last he got going, and some
of his G. and S. performances in his native
country were most artistic in all respects.
But Nature had given the gentle tenor no
physique to speak of. He was on the

small side as a stage hero, and, before he
left Australia, his sweet tenor had become
as hard as a brick, whilst his throat was
said to hold out no hope of the voice stand-
ing any more hard work. A wife with
£40,000 a year should be an easier profes-
sion for him than the stage.
“J.H.” (London) : Joe Coyne is playing
a man-about-town part in “Bede,” a new
French musical comedy, at the Garrick.
When I met him recently he was sitting on
a couch in the middle of an empty stage,
looking the picture of dejection. Some nefari-
ous paragraphist had mentioned that he
was 55. I calmed him down by a more or
less tactful reference to the discrimination
of Sydney and Melbourne audiences, and
after that it was plain sailing. Joe thinks
the Australian chorus-girl is in a class by
herself for go and all-round attractiveness.
“Nella”: I’ve seen the “Yankee at the
Court of King Arthur” picture, with a pre-
liminary glimpse of Mark Twain sitting up
in bed composing the yarn and smoking—
mostly smoking. But although the screen
assured me that Mark would have enjoyed
every flicker of the movie, could he have seen
it, I have my doubts. Sub-titles referring
to Mademoiselle from Armentiferes, and to
Australian neddies, like Eurythmic, got
laughs, of course ; but they had little of the
Mark Twain flavor. The whole thing seemed
more like a cheap parody, though the making,
of the film must have cost a fortune. It may*
have been funny for the immortal “Sandy”
to refer to a motor-car as a “Lizzie of tin,”
but for me the allusion was right out of the
picture—or should have been.
“Ancient Prompter”: “Skipped by the
Light of the Moon,” which “Snell” reintro-
duces to our notice (B. 23/11/’22), was
written by the recently-dead George R. Sims
in his earliest days as a “hack.” It was
played in England for a long while by the
clever Walton-llemming troupe, so called
because the Hemmings were all Waltons and
the Waltons Hemmings. Sims also provided
the family with a farce from the French,
“Mother-in-Law,” and a burlesque called
“Course-a-Kin Brothers.” George Walton,
after touring Australia, went to Africa and
died there. B rot hey Fred was here a few
years ago as the Toy Soldier in a William-
son pantomime. A nephew, Herbert, has a
part in Dennis’s “Sentimental Bloke.”
“Gard”: Not always did Ward think Aus-
tralia incapable of exporting a company
which could do jus-
tice to itself in a
London theatre (B.
9/11/’22). During
the war he wanted
the Firm to send
a complete Austra-
lian cast to Lon-
don to play “High
Jink s.” Dorothy
Brunton, Gladys
Moncrieff and
Maggie Dickenson
were marked down
for principal parts,
and a chorus and
ballet of 30 “female
Anzacs” were to
have been shipped
across the raging
main for the edifi-
cation of the bald-
heads of Blighty.
Ward was only
prevented from
seeing the thing
through by what
he now calls “the
anaemic policy of
my then asso-
cia t e s.” “High
Jinks” was pro-
duced by the Firm
in London, but not
in the manner
Hugh J. intended.
"Jimmie" Atholwood,
the veteran actor,
“Snell”: James Cathcart, remembered
only as a veteran in Australia, who played
Polonius and other harmless papas, used to
contend there was nothing so rejuvenating
as to play Romeo. A week’s run of Romeo,
he would declare, took five years off a man’s
age, and he had it as a bitter grievance
against managements that in refusing him
the opportunity of appearing as the youth-
ful Montague they were crowding him into
an early grave at 75. Towards the finish,
on his deathbed, he argued that he did not
want doctors, but merely the chance to play
Romeo to an appreciative audience. Almost
his last words were, “Let me play Romeo,
and I’ll live another 10 years; but they will
rather murder me than let me murder Shak-
speare.” Many actors have this faith in
certain characters, and one well-known act-
ress used to give private performances of
little Eva out of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” to
keep, as it were, in touch with youth.
“Tay-Pay” : Mention of Harry Shine (B.
16/11/’22) reminds me that his grave at
Waverley (N.S.W.), a few yards from the
Pacific, is marked by neither slab nor stone.
Johnny Sheridan lies below a handsome
memorial, erected by the greasepaint pro-
fession. But poor Shine’s mound is matted
with weeds.
“Arviragus”: “Second Murderer (B.
9/11/’22) is right in his surmise that “King
Lear” has not been seen in Sydney since
W. E. Sheridan’s wonderful portrayal of the
demented sovereign at the old Queen’s,' York-
street, in the early ’eighties. The crazy house
was condemned by the city authorities dur-
ing Sheridan’s season. William Creswick
revived “Lear” in 1878 at the old “Vic.”
in P'itt-street, where McCathie’s drapery now
stands, but it did not draw the town like
Sheridan’s production. Vivid in my memory,
however, is Myra Kemble’s brilliant imper-
sonation of the faithful Fool.
“0.K.”: Did the art of infusing quaint
and dainty humor into music of a somewhat
plaintive character die with Sullivan and
Cellier, the ex-choir bdys? In French
operas you get delicate (or indelicate)
gaiety, but not humorous musical expression
of droll ideas, such as Gilbert supplied to
Sullivan, and which Cellier, in one notable
instance, got from the librettist, if he didn’t
find it for himself. Among the Sullivan
scores, which bristle with airs to suit the
notions of the librettist, what could be more
humorous than the fairy choruses in
“lnto Parliament He Shall
Go,” and “You Naughty, Naughty Peers” are
ridiculously funny in their gravity of tone.
Nothing like them has been composed by
Sullivan’s successors. Of the composers
who have tried to catch his style the happiest
was the man who wrote the double sestet
in “Florodora,” “Tell Me, Pretty Maiden,” a
clever attempt at suiting grave melody to
frivolous lines. Cellier’s unforgettable mas-
terpiece was the ballad “They Say When
Wooing Days Are O’er,” with chorus of old
women, in “Dorothy.” Whether the de-
crepit old women, with their reflections on
the decay of dancing since their young days,
and their chorus of pity for the bride who is
going to be disillusioned, were the inspira-
tion of the composer, I know not, but the
graceful humor of their chorus is unique in
comic opera, as far as my recollection goes.
“Dorothy” is stamped with an individuality
which such tuneful works as “Merry Widow”
and “Chocolate Soldier” lack.
“Norbell”: When George Rignold tenanted
Sydney Majesty’s, in ’95, the rehearsals
were long and exacting. We usually began
at 10 a.m., and kept going till 2 or 3 in the
afternoon. Our heavy, who found the pro-
ceedings depressing, used to duck out of the
stagedoor whenever his waits permitted, and
run down the lane to a side bar of the George
for inspiration. He mixed drams with drama
so effectually that, by the time rehearsal was
over, he was generally inarticulate. Rignold
decided that the peg must be put in. So
rehearsal was called next day “in the dome,”
away up over the ceiling of the auditorium.
We had to climb four flights of stairs, dodge
through the gear and tackle of the flies, and
then shin up a steep ladder, and through a
manhole to a big lumber-room under the
roof. Rignold himself puffed and swore all
the way up, but he was satisfied that the vil-
lain was foiled. Not a bit of it. He got
more sozzled than ever. It transpired that
he used to dodge round a brick buttress, and
step out of a window on to the lead roof, and
from an adjoining window an obliging lift-
man of the George did the rest. We re-
sumed on-stage rehearsals after that, but the
stage door was kept locked, and the George
proclaimed the George out-of-bounds.
“T.W.”: If “J.F.H.” spent a month or
two in revisiting the Sydney and Melbourne
theatres he would not quarrel with 11. J.
Ward for stating an obvious fact (B.
9/11/’22). Brough’s company and the old
Royal Comics could have gone anywhere
without bringing the blush of shame to
Australia’s young cheeks. But nobody can
pretend that the present combinations are fit
to deliver the goods to Deicester-square and
the Strand. Before Australians can hope to
do first-class team work again they will have
to forget their foolish worship of mediocrities
who are alleged to have “starred” in Lon-
don theatres, but whose names are quite
unknown to the Smoke. The continent is
infested with these overboomed persons, who
convey to young artists utterly false notions
of what London wants.
“Plasmon”: “Secrets,” a new London play,
which the Firm is understood to have secured
for Australia, is interesting for a new varia-
tion of the underclothing joke. The mid-
Victorian heroine, Mary Marlow, decides to
elope with John Carlton and, in order to get
away at once, she has to doff her evening
gown for a travelling crinoline. The trouble
is that Mary cannot unfasten herself from the
back, and, John being the only help avail-
able, he has to see a good deal more of his
promised biide than the conventions of that
period allowed. It is rather a piquant situa-
tion, and much point is given to it in Lon-
don by Fay Compton and Leon Quartermaine.
The latter is a brother of Madge Tither-
adge’s good-looking husband, who was out
here 10 or so years back with the Lewis
Waller company. Fay Compton will be re-
membered as the first wife of Pelissier, of
the London Follies. She is a sister of
Compton Mackenzie.
“E.”: The Nobel prize for literature has
been awarded to Jacinto Benavento, the
Spanish dramatist. Benavento used to be
a pantomime clown. His best-known play,
“Bonds of Interest,” was the first work pro-
duced at the Everyman Theatre, under the
direction of Norman McDermott. I saw the
first performance at Hampstead, in a converted
drill-hall, before a thin audience, when
there was considerable difficulty with the
scenic and lighting effects. It is a picar-
esque play, in the old Spanish style, clever
and witty, but hardly distinguished enough to
merit the Nobel prize. But the Nobel seems
to be awarded on political rather than lit-
erary grounds.
“Thor”: Walford Davies, one of the most
unbendingly academic of Britain’s musicians,
says that all public libraries should have
sound-proof chambers, in which there should
be gramophones with records of musical mas-
terpieces. In this way, he says, music-lovers
would be able to acquaint themselves with
any sonata or suite they wish to study. The
British Museum and another in Paris are
already stored with many records of great

voices and the instrumental masters, but
these are being kept in hermetically-sealed
containers to be fired off at posterity after
a hundred years or more. In Australia,
where music’s a laggard, Walford Davies*
suggestion would be a boon to keen students
who have little opportunity of keeping up
with the march or musical progress. But
the selection would have to be taken out of
the hands of the weird old buffers, some of
them hopelessly ignorant, who become trus-
tees of public libraries.

ported from London, was one of the saving sort. Not
penurious, but grown careful by experience. When
he visited Australia a quarter of a century ago—the
first risky importation that the late Rickards ventured
—Ohirgwin was one of the few veterans at the game
who played for safety. Out of his salary of £lOO a
week he had sent a draft for £l6OO to London some
time before his 26 weeks’ engagement had expired.
He had “sworn off’’ the booze, and was a model of
quiet, healthful living. The tallj slim nigger min-
strel was wont to moralise on his giddy past in the
spirit of Dennis’s Sentimental Bloke, never forgetting
the time when he and a brother were partners in a
minstrel “turn” commanding a maximum of £8
a week for the pair. The brother fell ill sud-
denly, and Chirgwin was required to supply the
"turn” off his own bat. Accustomed only to back-talk
and concerted musical business, he didn’t quite
know what to do. It was under managerial pres-
sure that he went on trembling with his camp-stool,
and delivered a few impromptus between his songs
to his own banjo or violin accompaniment. Thrown
on his own resources, Ohirgwin was ponular from
the jump, but he was not the While-eyed Kaffir in
the first place. The story is historic in vaudeville
of how the anxious soloist in his early days wiped
perspiration from his blacked face with his knuckles,
and brought off the blacking from one eye. The
audience roared, and Chirgwin’s fortune was made.
He knew how to be funny before opening his mouth,
and the diamond-shaped white eye was his trade-
mark thenceforth. The appearance of the long,
thin, black figure in tights, with the whitened eye
region in striking contrast, was undoubtedly funny,
and his way of uttering simple “gags” with a Cockney
accent was carefully studied. Chirgwin was an
artist who made very little real humor go a long
way. One of his brightest remarks was his intro-
duction. to his singing of the mawkish “Blind
Boy,” with accompaniment on a one-stringed fiddle:
“I don’t know whether you will like this little
ditty, but—anyhow, you’ve got to ’ave it.” The
little joke which Chirgwin originated was charac-
teristic of the man. Musically' he was clever and
magnetic. His nasal singing voice was well pro-
duced, and his sympathetic rendering of “My Fiddle
Is My Sweetheart” was more effective than any of
his imitators made it. Also he could swagger round
the stage playing the bagpipes in a more fetching
way than the fellows who came after him. The
word “fetching” expresses the reason for Chirgwin’s
long life as a notable entertainer in always the same
character. He was an interesting survival from old
Christy Minstrel times.
THE INFERIOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How oft her little hand I’ve held
So tenderly in mine,
The While my manly bosom swelled
With rapture half divine,
Yet sad am I, for on the street
She does not know me when we meet.
She has a plump and pleasing form,
As I’ve good cause to know,
For I have felt it soft and warm
Not many hours ago;
Yet she will be unknowing, cold,
When next my face she may behold.
For when we meet by any chance,
I win no friendly smile,
I do not even get a glance,
Though in a little while,
It may be I will hold her nigh,
And bear my darling shoulder high.
She lets me make sweet love to her,
She lets me stroke her head.
Yet, if I meet her anywhere,
She cuts me —-cuts me dead.
She is the Star —a thing of joy—
And I am but a chorus boy !

velvet and satin . “ • / ”
I AM a self-sufficient sort of a razor, I
know exactly what a man needs in order
to get a smooth, perfect shave every morn-
ing, and I am designed to do the whole job,
not just a part of it.
Easily the most important part of a shave is the operation
that goes before—and after. The stropping and the cleaning.
My way is to do my own stropping. I carry a device
in my head which strops my blade accurately and quickly.
You should see me run up and down a strop. You don’t
have to worry about “touch” or knack. You don’t need
any separate stropping machine.
There is no need to detach my blade even for cleaning,
A rinse in water and a rub along my strop is sufficient
to leave the edge of my blade keen for the next shave.
Ask for me at any good razor shop— my name is
“VALET”—and my surname is “AUTOSTROP”-*
the razor that sharpens itself.
I would like to make your acquaintance I

The reliability of the CASE is no accident. This Tractor is manufactured
by the biggest firm of tractor specialists in the world, and is made specially for
the job. Every part of a CASE is designed to withstand the hard usage to which
a farm tractor is subjected. Write us for full specifications of the CASE 15/27,

CHRISTMAS NUMBER,

Dawson's last yarn. He chose it him-
self, a few weeks before his death, as the
one by which he wanted to be repre-
sented in the Christmas issue. There
is a remarkably fine collection of pic-
tures, the frontispiece being an Abo.
idyll by B. E. Minns. Abbott, Bedford,
Dyson and “Kodak” are among the old
favorites who figure in this number, and
some brilliant new men make their first
bow. Altogether it is an astonishing
sixpenn’orth.

postage to pay for three paragraphs, two of them
smellful and one stale, all written in hardly decipher-
able pencil. Our anathema on you. .. . Veritas: We
don t doubt your bona fides; but the par. was sup-
plied bj' a close relative... .Tom Hah: Have it your
own way, then, to the extent of eight lines:—
Now yer askin’ the blanky reason why, sir,
We blokes are a pickin’ at the Kaiser?
In the scrap lorst me leg, me cobber ’is eye, sir;
That’s one reason we curse Wilhelm—ex-Kaiser.

. ...E.J.G.: No improvement in the yarn since it
was last offered D.M.11.: As musical as the lilt
of an ungreased wheelbarrow Dolly M.: Such work
should be reserved for grandma and the curate....
P.M.S.: Not worth arguing about S.J.J.: Nothing
in it.. . .F.M.J.: The yarn is aged and the manner
p00r....D.E. (Oamaru) : Doesn’t get near. .. .Elsie
G.: Even for 15 it is unremarkable. ... R.J.W.: You
ask why Australians don’t write about Australia.
And in reply we inquire, Are you blind or have you
been drunk for the last 40 years ? Battler J.:
Lumpy verse, and the nice moral tag at the end
doesn't help it much.. .C.C.0.: Doesn’t strike us. .. .
Frank F.: Wanted better handling. .. .A.D.M.: We
want the sort of stuff we publish—that or better....
W.L.8.T.: Not much yarn there The Dean:
Hardly worth remembering. ... Stanley C.: The
“Dreams” don’t get near....Tyum: It fails to thrill
J.A.F.: You saw the sun setting and thought
you were far from home; and you say it in a drab
manner. .. .K. A. M.: Not up.... Harry N.: It has
points, but not enough of them....S.S. (Casino):
Too mechanical. .. .Mary R.: The same old common-
places. .. . J.M.S.: Picture-show stuff. .. . Arcady:
Held for inquest L.A.S.: Rather technical, but
has a sporting chance. .. .H.C.R.: “The Bloke Wot
Reads the Dope” wasn’t stirred.... Gladys P.: Pro-
bably... .A.N. A.: A yarn that merely tells how a
perfectly useless girl got a perfectly useless husband
is no good here. .. .F.S.G.: Doesn’t strike us.... Kat:
The simple pastoral poem has the richer color: —■
I’m only a poor city-breed chap,
W T ho worked for a cocky down south ;
Long were my hours, and I couldn’t open my mouth
Because he had me under the lap.
But when I did squell I used my might
For well I knew the cocky would want to fight.
He worked me hard, day and night,
Finding me jobs was his greatest delight,
Milking the cows, feeding each pig ;
Worked me till I felt just like a nig ;
Had me out wood-cutting in the frost
Long before the hens were off the roost.
After break he swooped on me to shovel slime
And heavy muck, up till dinner-time,
From his cowyard that was over-ripe.
Worked me for my blooming life.
When I lit a fag and grew a trifle bold
The cocky cantered up at me to scold.
. ...C.F.M: Mostly commonplace interlarded with
such rhymes as “dawn-warn” and “calm-alarm.”
. ...S.C. (Bellata) : “Dad” and his selection have
been overworked. Give them a rest.... Boomerang:
The yarn is made to a recipe. .. .A.M.H.: “Achieve-
ment” fails. .. .A.P.D.: Don’t like it. .. .Annette J.:
“The Open Road” is hard-worked commonplace. . . .
V.A.E.: “A Trick of Fate” is the best, but it is like
a battlefield for gore and a picture-drama for im-
probability.... Sarto: It is only “Tomlinson” done
badly.... Danilo: Very crude stuff. .. .Jas. B.: Both
fail... .W.G.W.: The telling of the thin little yarn
is shockingly pretentious and bad.... Joeelle: Not
up H.R.8.: They want more thought and more
5ki11.... Felice T.: Mostly melodrama.... Pam: The
tears for the cat fall in vain....E.C. (Brisbane):
“Jewels” too confused... .J.H. “Release” and “Blue
Moon” must go back. . . ,8.8. (Argyle) : Can’t find
the mirth. . . .8.M.N.Z.: Not up. . . .Tramp: Your
sense of humor wants washing. . . .W.11.L.: They used
to put things like that in albums. .. .R.D.C.: Not
enough in it... .Son-o’-the-Wild: Dull and badly
written... .D.M. (Galaquil) : Not up... .R.P.P.: One
stanza:—
I recall your burning kisses, “Eyes of Brown,”
As I held you to my bosom, “Eyes of Brown.”
There were sometimes nights of sadness —there were
also nights of gladness,
How you hugged me, how you tugged me, “Eyes of
Brown.”
. ...G.W. (Glebe): Not good enough.... Fred A.:
Not well enough done. . . .R.W.C.: Doesn’t strike us.
. ...J.W. (Camperdown) : Poor stuff... . I.W. (Joli-
mont) : Gets to nothing.... Rosa R.: Both miss....
Luaka: Not credible, as t01d.... John D.: Hard to
know what it’s all about... .W.O’M.: Too thin and
vague... .M.H. (Wahroonga) : No yarn there.... A.
Jackass: You have a fine, free style:—
I’ll snatch you to me in a jiff ;
Your face just draws me so ;
And when I hold you thus —and thus —
By hell, I won’t let go.
For when I crush you to me, dear,
’Twill chase away the blues.
Bon soil', wee elf, I’ll ’ave you now,
Great God! ’Tis little Hughes!
Enough! I’ve wakened from my dream
And nearly off my head.
I mutter low, “What might have been.”
Adieu. Enough—is said.

“U.P.” : The Speck is a lucky little State.
It had Tatt.’s thrust upon it to add to the
revenue, English capitalists are rushing there
to install factories, and the latest windfall is
that the Colonial Office seems reluctant to
supply a new Governor. Sir William Allar-
dyce quitted his job because the salary of
£2750 a year wasn’t a living wage. That,
was about nine months ago, and Sir William
has since been appointed Governor of New-
foundland, but Downing-street has not yet
said anything about a new man. If it is
waiting for the screw-ter he increased, it will
be a long time before the Tasmanian Chief
Justice lays down his supplementary job.

For Christmas.
For your home you want music in all its original
power and effectiveness—anything less than the
complete realism of The Neiv Edison must
eventually prove unsatisfying. Alone of all
instruments it gives that true music of which
everyone sooner or later feels the need.
This Christmas see that the family is enjoying
every phase of music as created by the world’s
greatest artists and Re-Created by The New
Edison. On request we will gladly arrange an
opportunity for you to test New Edison realism
on your own account —or send the free book,
“Music’s Re-Creation.”
TSc NEW EDISON
“The Phonograph with a Soul”
ONCE in every year comes
that season of mysterious
and exciting preparations
—Christmas, the family festival.
Gifts for individual members
must be considered; but in real-
ity far more important are those
communal ones that make for
the continuance of the home and
for the enrichment of its daily
life.
To love your home is to wish it
filled with music—music of that
higher cultural kind that has
been made possible by The
New Edison.”
This new instrument must not
be confused with ordinary talk-
ing-machines. For instance, its
realism is perfect; living music
and that Re-Created by The
New Edison cannot be told
apart, even though heard in
direct comparison—a test sus-
tained by no other phonograph.

“Fana” : An industry that should flourish
anywhere in South-Eastern Australia is the
cultivation of the mint plant ( Mentha piper-
ita), from which the peppermint-oil of phar-
macy and commerce is obtained. The plant
grows easily, the oil is abundant and easily
extracted, and there is a strong demand for
it in medicine, liqueur-making, confectionery
and other industries. The wholesale price
is £lO a pound.
* * * *
“U.P.”: A new industry is being started
in Westraiia. The Chelonia Co., formed in
London, intends trading in turtle from the
north-west coast of W.A. At Rockingham,
south of Fremantle, canning and preserving
works and “holding-pens” are being con-
structed, and schooners will be employed to
bring the turtles from the coast. “Chelonia,”
by the way, is Greek for tortoise.

Two advts. from a recent issue of Mel-
bourne Akgus :
Farm Labourer wanted; intelligent, capable work-
ing experimental farm under advisory council ;
£4 4s. per week. Field Officer, Department of
Agriculture. Applications invited. Yearly rate of
pay, £192 minimum, £240 maximum.
And in the latter case, besides voluminous
proofs of knowledge and experience, it is
mentioned that applicants “should possess
an agricultural college diploma” !
* * * *
“Audire” gives “alteram partem ” ;
Despite “Macnade's” par. (B. 9/11/’22), there is
no doubt that Yankee machine bookkeeping is here
to stay. On results, it deserves to. Would “Mac-
nade” install machinery and let it look after and
run itself, or throw good machines out for the ineffi-
ciency of the operators? Not long since I had to
reorganise a large office where statements were being-
sent out between 10th and 20th of each month, and
balances were finalised from 20th to 25th, and some-
times later. After the initial month of the installa-
tion of £BOO of machinery that office was saving
£6OO per annum in salaries, and night-work had
been abolished. This is not an isolated case. I
am not interested in any machine emporium or
Hvstem house, but find as an accountant that systems
used properly are a boon to business and to audi-
tors generally.
“T.R.H.”: “Pitt Streeter” (B. 2/11/’22)
asks “What’s the patter with ‘The Pawned
Pants of Inebriety’ for the poster sub-
title of a play? I reply that, in Sydney, at
all events, no such things are. It takes a
lot of persuasion to get a set of false teeth
with a gold plate across the pop-shop counter
nowadays! Pants have no hope. A com-
plete suit may find favor in the eyes of the
children of Israel (provided it is submitted
at a slack hour of the day), but pawned
pants are a possibility of the past! Had it
• not been so, I should have had meat for
dinner to-day! '
* * * *
“Wafin” : The artist and the opportunist
again. On Derby Day in Melbourne an
artistic speculator modelled with consider-
able skill a horse’s head in the sand left
by some builders in Swanston-street. The
financial response however was faint, and
after harvesting a few coppers the
modeller faded away. Later in the day
I found another nondescript in possession.
He had scrawled “Harvest King” over the
masterpiece, and with a tongue that dripped
artful appeal, and his hands and clothes
convincingly covered in sand, he was raking
in trays and browns with the speed and
elation of a suburban householder gather-
ing in snails.
* #■ * *
“O’D.” : There is a difference of opinion
among Queensland cotton-growers about
ratooning, which, in plain English, means
growing another crop off the same old stalk,
instead of planting new seed each year.
Daniel Jones, who is looked upon as the
father of Queensland cotton, says that
ratooning is a good stunt. The English ex-
perts hold that it is not, and Theodore and
co. have backed the Lancashire brigade by
announcing that the Government guarantee
will not be paid for ratooned cotton. This
strikes hard the growers who have followed
the advice of the old experts. Jones, who
is now in Westraiia, maintains that there
will still be a ready market for the ratooned
cotton in Japan and China, but it seems
likely that the old crops will be ploughed
out. ■
* * * *
Arthur J. Donne: “Cleveland” makes an
attack (B. 9/11/’22) on the distributors in
Australia of nautical publications. In reply
I would point out: —
(1) Each pilot book published by the British
Admiralty Hydrographic Department is sold by the
department at 10s., not Ss. to 6s. There are six
firms who handle these publications in Australia, and
the price to be charged for any Admiralty publica-
tion is fixed by the Hydrographer in London, the
price of the pilot books being 15s. each. The extra
Is. 6d. paid by “Cleveland” was possibly postal
charges or the bookseller’s unauthorised discount.
(2) “Cleveland” displays his ignorance in saying
that any ship captain in his right mind would risk
his 8.0. T. certificate rather than pay the prices
mentioned above. In the several years during which
I have been running a chart-agency I have never
yet; encountered a skipper who paid for either charts
or pilot books, both of these items being a charge
against the shipowner.
“Cleveland,” by the way, seems to think that
running a chart-agency is easy money. Of the
six agencies in Australia_ there are only two
which think it worth while to hold anything
like a stock. There has never been an
agency at Perth, though the appointment can
be had for the asking.
SIGNS OF THE TIMES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the conjunction of the stars
Signs, prophecies and omens loom,
Dark auguries of storms and wars,
Dim tokens of impending doom.
And earth has portents, too, for those
Whose eyes can read the given sign:
Witness a herb that ever grows
Foreshadowing some fell design.
Alas! your peace is but a sham;
Swell while you may, foredoomed green pea !
Skip while you can, ill-fated lamb!
The mint is sprouting fast and free.

“Stargazer” : The old actor was delving into
the past. “No, I never married. Not that I
didn’t have my chances.” Here he threw in
a raffish grin. “I have been wooed. I was
slim then, and had fine features, and
female impersonation was a stunt of mine.
So they cast me to play the good matronly
aunt in ‘The Last Crime,’ and I must have
played it darned well, too, because, during
our week’s run in Bendigo, a queer old bloke
haunted the front stalls, and on the fifth
night sent me a proposal of marriage. lie
explained in his note where it was he sat,
and inspection was/invited. lie was, he
said, an old miner with £20,000, and he was
very lonely. He wanted just such a woman
as me, and if I was willing we could be
married right away; I declined with thanks.
I said I was a respectable married yyoman
with several children. Then some interfer-
ing swine told him; I was of the masculine
gender, at which he got out after me with
a nullah. He chased me about Bendigo ;
he chased our train to Melbourne. He
laid in wait for me with his nullah, and
when I took action in self-defence, the Bench
held he had good cause and great provocation.
He pleaded that I had trifled with his affec-
tions!”
“Flicker”: Just one more candidate for the
British Pension Stakes. The “heirs of the
Duke of Schomberg” have been drawing
£720 a year from the British taxpayer ever
since the scrap at the Boyne in 1690. The
present recipient of the cash is the Marquis
of Lothian, the Schomberg name, arms and
pension having come into his family through
marriage. In this direction alone “The
Boyne Water” has cost Britain £167,040 in
solid cash. The chief, joke of it is that when
the battle was fought the ancestor of the
present Lord Lothian was doing his best to
raise an army in Scotland for King James.
“ Up’s” sidelight:—•
“An’ ’igh-clarss trade?” said the hardware man
in answer to my inquiry anent his newly-opened busi-
ness. “Well, it depends on what you’d call ’igh-
clarss. P’r’aps you reckon, like I useter when I
started in business, that in a suburb where every
second ’ouse has a garage, telephone and tennis-
court attached to it the people think in pounds in-
stead of pence. D y’ see this?” lie picked up a
<lieap china butter-dish. “There were three dozen
here when I started, and I could hardly give them
away. Not swanky enough? So I thought—until ar.
old dame put me wise. I tried to work off one on
her to save my small change—cut a penny on the
price, too—but she wouldn’t have it. She said they
were extravagant: that the butter collects in this
scolloped edge and is wasted. But I got rid of ’em.
I labelled ’em, ‘Just the thing for the dog’s milk,’ put
thrippence on the price, and sold ’em nearly all with-
in a week. Yesterday a Jane, wrapped in furs, came
up in a six-cylinder touring. She was after a
gadget she thought she’d read about in some Yankee
paper. It was a thing to scrape the dinner-plates
and mince the scrapings at the same time. Yes, I
suppose you would call it an ’igh-clarss trade.”
“P.A.”: Anent Geo. R. Sims, perhaps his
best drama, “Harbor Lights,” was being
filmed at Falmouth at the date *of his
death. The producer was young Tom Ter-
riss, the son of that William Terriss who
produced the drama on its first two years’
run at the Adelplii, and later was killed at
the stage-door of that theatre. The Admi-
ralty, for the purposes of the film, lent a
battleship with a complement of officers and
crew. The commander was Captain Gar-
forth R.N., who commanded the Russell at
Jutland, and now faces powder and the screen
as “Captain Hardy.” Another Sims film to
come out shortly is “Lights o’ London,”
which is to be followed by “Colleen Bawn.”
with Tom Moore in the leading rule. Tom’s
brother is Owen Moore, whom Mary Pick-
ford threw into the discard for Douggy," the
fat. fair and frolicsome; and another brother
is Matt Moore, who plays the lounge lizard
in “The Storm” at the New Oxford.
“Min Yip” on Bac. hot. :—
Now that the Bacillus botulinus (or, in plain
English, the sausag'e bacillus) is being boomed, owing
to the Loch Marie disaster, let me bring it nearer
home, merely transferring its habitat from -.the
human species to our domestic animals, the horse,
cow and sheep. It will probably come as a shock
to the majority of Australian cockies to learn that
the following well-known diseases are practically one
and the Same, and that the cause of infection is
the so-called “sausage bacillus,” viz., forage poison-
ing, staggers, grass disease (Great Britain), impaction
paralysis, AVinton disease (Victoria), dry bible (S.
Australia) and Midland cattle disease (Tasmania).
Your vet., if consulted, will probably call it cerebro-
spinal meningitis. The infection is caused chiefly
by mouldy feed, whether in the paddock or in the
form of chaff-ensilage, mouse-infected fodder, or the
decayed bones often chewed by cattle. The symp-
toms are those of progressive bulbar paralysis, viz.,
difficulty.. in reaching for food and in chewing and
swallowing, salivation, protrusion of tongue, stoppage
of digestive movements, and staggering gait until the
animal goes down. The obvious preventive treatment
is to destroy the source of infection, taking into con-
sideration the fact that there is an incubStion period
of at least two days, and noting the food consumed
previous to that and extending over a period of sev-
eral days. Hundreds of horses have contracted this
disease, with very few recoveries, in the wheat-growing
areas of Victoria during the past few months. Mouse-
infected fodder is undoubtedly the cause. There
are local wheat stacks riddled with mice, and nothing
to prevent what is unfit for rebagging spreading the
disease when sold for animal feed. A motion has
just been carried by the AVheat Board (Vic.), that
next year all stacks be made mouse-proof. A perfect
example of the policy of locking the door of the
medicine-chest after the horse has poisoned himself
with the contents.
“Wilfrido”: There are five M.L. water-
siders who can be ealled upon at any time
to say a kind word for the Law. They were
members of the union, and refused to pay a
levy of £1 per member (which had been im-
posed as a fighting and defence fund) on
the ground that it was illegal and ultra vires.
As a result, their names were struck off
the register, and they became ineligible for
employment except in breach of an agreement
between the employers and the federation.
They then tendered the levy, and it was re-
fused. „ They could obtain neither satisfac-
tion or work till they laid their case before
a lawyer. The next happening of moment
occurred when a jury of 12 good men and
true, reduced to tears by the tale of victim-
isation, gave the five plaintiffs a coo] £2OB
each. The defendant union is unlikely to
try that sort of compulsion again.

foremost and all the time, only in terms of
its goodness and the results it gives.

productions, how accurately Dodge Brothers
have anticipated the popular demand of the
day.
The Higher Radiator, the Re-designed Cowl,

tribute to enhance the appearance of the car.
In every detail the car reflects the purpose of

Just Charming,
By “PHLOX.”
A CAREER is all right, Audrey, as
far as it goes; but I don’t think
it is sufficient to satisfy the aver-
age woman’s heart.”
“I suppose, Aunt, that’s why you gave
up your medical practice and married Uncle
Edward.”
“Yes. I was getting on in years when I
married. I had begun to feel that want of
companionship with someone I could really
call my own—someone who was more to me
than a friend.”
“Those are my sentiments, Aunt. I feel
I have a more interesting career than most
women with a lectureship at the University
and my research work in archaeology, but
there’s something wanting.”
And that something, my dear Audrey, is
a husband. I’ve been through the same thing
myself, and I know —it’s the same old story,
old yet ever new. I loved my profession as
you love yours, but alone it was unsatisfy-
ing.”
“Yes, Aunt. I realised that when I saw
Nita Anderson’s radiantly happy face as she
announced her engagement to be married;
then I realised that even a career does not
compensate for a life of single blessedness.
You ’remember that jolly girl who passed so
brilliantly in Arts! She’s going to marry
Professor Butler.”
“And I think,' Audrey, it’s about time
you looked around for a husband. You’re
not cut out for an old maid, though of late
you’ve acquired one or two little prim ways,
and the average man does like a little bit of
fluffiness about a woman.”
"What do you mean?”
“I mean that you want to take more pains
with your general appearance; fluff out your
hair a bit, and so on.”
“But I don’t happen to have fluffy hair.”
“Then you’ve got to fluff it; also to im-
prove your skin; in fact, where Nature has
been deficient, supply the deficiency with
art. That’s what I do. But I promised
to meet Uncle at 6 o’clock, and it’s nearly
that now—l must be going. Good-bye,
Audrey, and think over what I’ve told you.”
Audrey Johnson was thinking over what
her practical aunt had suggested when she
was interrupted by someone wrapping on her
study door.”
“Come in,” she called.
Professor Livingstone’s pretty wife
entered. She had come to ask Miss Johnson
to join in a send-off to Nita Anderson.
After this had been satisfactorily arranged
they talked of all kinds of things.
Audrey had often noticed what pretty,
fluffy hair Mrs. Livingstone had, and how
beautifully she dressed it. Why not ask
her for some hints on hairdressing?
Mrs. Livingstone felt quite flattered at be-
ing asked for advice by clever Miss Johnson.
“So much depends,” she told her, “on the
way the hair is shampooed as to whether
the hairdressing will be a success. Per-
sonally, I always use fcstailax,” said Mrs.
Livingstone, "and 1 find it makes the hair
beautifully glossy, fluffy and easy to dress.”
“And that's just what I want,” replied
Miss Johnson.
“Do you ever use a hair tonic?”
“No, I’m afraid I’ve never given much
thought to my appearance, but I intend to
turn over a new leaf in that respect.”
“I can give you a recipe for a simple,
home-made tonic. You buy a package of
boranium from the chemist, mix it with
a quarter of a pint of bay turn, aim rub into
the scalp occasionally.
“Do you know,” went on bright little
Mrs. Livingstone,,'“a little while ago I was
getting quite grey, and I happened to hear
a woman in a chemist’s shop ask for two
ounces of concentrate of tammalite and three
ounces of bay rum to mix with it. She
then turned to her friend and said that there
was nothing like it for restoring grey hair to
its original color. I thereupon ordered the
same, and now I haven’t the sign of a grey
hair.”
“I’m glad to know of that, too, for I’m
continually pulling grey hairs out of my
head.”
“But, Miss Johnson, when you begin to
look after your hair you must also look
after your skin, and I find that there’s
nothing like mercolized wax for keeping the
skin soft, clear and free from blemishes.”
“My aunt was telling me that I badly need
a skin food, but she didn’t tell me what to
use.”
“All the well-preserved women I know
seem to use mercolized wax. It contains
oxygen, and removes the old worn-out skin
so imperceptibly and painlessly that you
don’t know the process is going on until
some fine day one of your friends will re-
mark, ‘I don’t know what you’ve been doing
to your skin, but it’s like a baby’s.’ ”
“Then, that’s certainly the cream for me.”
“Well, if you care to come round to my
place when you have time I will show you
a pretty way of dressing your hair, believe
me, my husband always keeps me up to the
mark, and is delighted to hear people whis-
per a 3 we pass, ‘Look! isn’t she just charm-
ing?’ ”

Joles Keef.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I.
From the pocket-book of Joles Keef, a Mexican
ex-convict, who came to Australia on a trading
barque.
1 CRACKED the crib of the Yellow Ace,
I killed the woman and fled the place,
But Annie the barmaid found me knife,
Now “any-man’s-Annie” is mine—for wife.
I buy her beads for her freckled throat
And she spits her poison at me —the stoat!
She takes a man, if it please her whim,
Burns, and goes to the dogs with him.
If I bare me teeth or clench me hand,
She gives me a look that I understand.
We trail the seas an’ I clip me beard,
Or go clean-shave, as I chance to be feared.
Ann shakes red curls in the green sea-breeze,
I clench me fist an’ I knock me knees.
She laughs, “Cheer up, have a drink, an’
hope!
You’d better have Ann than the hangman’s
rope.”
She spends the brass, I drink the beer,
An’ brood on what day, or week, or year
She’ll give me away to a fancy bloke,
While I curve me hands fer her pipe to
choke!
The one rope then would answer fer tw0....
That’s it! if she squeals on me, that I’ll do!
We’ll trail the seas till the brass is done,
An’ then we’ll see who’s the frightened one.
When her eyes start out of her scarlet head,
Will she shut up, livin’, or scream out dead?
Hell! Women is women an’ beads is beads.
Give booze an’ clo’es, an’ kicks an’ weeds,
An’ you’ll hold yer own with ’em every day.
That’s how to manage ’em. That’s the way.
But Ann has eyes like a yeller dog,
That ’ud find its prey through the blackest
fog.
And red-headed Annie has found me knife
With stains that would traffic away me life.
I’ve got to drink! God, there ain’t no hope.
I’m dragged at the end of a hangman’s rope.
She’s out with Guido the slanty-eyed,
Will she?
11.
Having been betrayed by Ann, Joles Keef escaped
and made for Mexico.
Found on a piece of wrapping-paper in the saloon
of Sanchez Diaz, at Las Culcas.
I’m taki.n’ the trail for the Rio Grande.
I’ve got Ann sure. Once I lay me hand
On her gramophone, I shall be all right.
I’m settlin’ for you with Diaz to-night.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TEWKS deposited his palette on the
sloping roof so that he might dis-
engage a hand to fill his pipe. He
was sitting on the parapet, and the street
into which he idly dropped the match he
had just used was three storeys below. Hav-
ing satisfied himself that the glowing frag-
ment had landed on the hat of a pedestrian
beneath, he returned to his task of trans-
muting the luminous tones of the late after-
noon clouds into a libel upon their soft
texture and grace. The roof with a flat
space of about a foot at the bottom was lit-
tered with broken furniture, a bedraggled
mattress, about four dozen bottles and in-
numerable cigarette-butts and used matches.
The artist was diverted presently from
such interest as he took in his work and
in his surroundings by a head which ap-
peared through the shattered frame of one
of the windows. The owner excitedly urged
him to come inside. Wiping his brush on
the inside of his coat, he climbed through
the aperture. He was confronted by his
friend Clinker, who shared with him the
dustiness of the attic. A strange light
blazed in Clinker’s eyes.
“By the noble gent. Don Diego, I’ve found
it,” he cried, “and it’s genuine!”
“A pound-note?”
“A pound-note?” echoed Clinker scorn-
fully. "No ; a Rembrandt!”
Explanations followed, after which the pair
rattled down the three flights of steep stairs
at a speed that would have caused envy in a
chamois. They bolted round the corner and
stopped before a dingy shop where Clinker
pointed to an almost black painting lying on
a shelf beside a complete set of “The Clergy-
man’s Monthly” and an old cutlass.
“I went in with that rusty fountain-pen
I picked up in the park,” explained Clinker,
“and I found that. I pretended to be look-
ing at the sword, and rubbed some of the
dust off, and I saw a head, and down at the
bottom an ‘R.’ I’ll swear it’s a Rem-
brandt.”
Tewks betrayed incredulity, but Clinker
proceeded excitedly. “Don’t you remember
how they found a Reynolds in Tasmania, and
the Mona Lisa in an old cupboard?” The
second assertion was a pure invention pro-
duced by the ecstatic sense of discovery. An
argument ensued on the possibilities of the.
picture really being an original, which worked
somehow into a mutual effort to remember
the large prices various famous works of art
had fetched. This left them with a glowing
certainty of imminent fortune which was
almost as pleasant as the actual achievement
of wealth. The problem was to discover the
price of the picture without awakening sus-
picion. This was complicated by the fact
that all they possessed was the money
obtained from the fountain-pen, namely, one
and threepence.
“If I go in and ask him, and then haven’t
got enough money, he’ll he suspicious, and
if we don’t know how much he wants, how
can we start raising the cost?” reasoned
Clinker.
“We needn’t worry,” replied Tewks; “he’ll
be so suspicious at us wanting to buy any-
thing that a little extra won’t matter.”
But Clinker refused to have his treasure-
trove jeopardised. “We’ll have to raise some-
thing first,” he explained, “and then test
him to see how cheaply he’ll sell it. These
things must be done carefully. With tact.”
Feeling that he had scored, he led his com-
panion away on that melancholy Odyssey,
the search for money.
“It’s no use trying old Bismarck, I sup-
pose?” said Tewks.
“Not much hope,” was the reply.
Old Bismarck was a white-haired mystery
who shared the top storey with them. He
inhabited the back room, and added to the
lumber of bedsteads and broken jugs that
filled the landing with an archaic sign-
board intimating that the Geneva Clock-
mending Co. was to be found by entering
his door, as directed by the bony fingers of
a hand which had been painted for him by
Tewks for a shilling. He had two large
padlocks on his door, and his room was full
of clocks, most of which he seemed to keep
wound, for they sounded their alarms inter-
mittently throughout the night. Occasion-
ally he locked both the padlocks while for-
getting to pull the bolts across first, and
Tewks, yielding to the temptation so offered,
had once or twice abstracted one of his
clocks and resold it to him at a modest price.
But there were scant prospect now of ex-
tracting revenue from the connoisseur, and
so they wandered along the pavement dis-
cussing the possibility of raising cash else-
where, with the frankness of those to whom
all friendship is communistic and whose
mere acquaintances are regarded as owing
a toll for the honor bestowed on them by
recognition. Tewks bubbled over with fan-
tastic and impracticable schemes, such as
starting a two-up school, backing a winner
or faking an insurance policy, but Clinker’s
effort to concentrate always paralysed his
normally weak mental processes, so that his
only contribution to such councils was a
feeble “something’ll come along if we keep
our eyes open.”
They found themselves eventually in the
neighborhood of a wine-bar which they usu-
ally patronised at about 6 o’clock whether
they had money or not. On descending the
short stairs the adventurers discerned at one
of the corner tables three familiar figures.
They consisted of Splitter, a tall, thin man,
who smiled inanely until the expression was
jerked off his face by a hiccup, whereupon he
slowly and laboriously gathered the thing
together again, inch by inch, till his face re-
sumed its normal expression of good cheer ;
Lemmons, a stumpy fellow, who looked over-
laden with a burden of profound thought
until, after a period of abysmal cogitation,
he leaned across and asked for a match or
a cigarette, or both —generally both. His
manner varied. Sometimes he asked for the
match first, and then discovered he had mis-
laid his cigarettes; sometimes he obtained
a cigarette first and then asked with an
assumption of anger who had pinched his
matches. And, thirdly, there was O’Swivel,
a youth with a face like one of Rubens’s
fauns, fantastic and of the woodland; his
forte was extempore verse, and often he had
thrilled a pie-stall audience in the young
hours of the morning with ballads on Fowl-
house Kate or Erie, the Lobster King. After
the first ecstasies of recognition were over
and drinks all round were standing on the
greyish marble of the tabletop, Tewks opened
his' campaign.
“I’ve been thinking of starting a raffle,”
he said.
“Why?” demanded Lemmons from the
depth of his being, as though a hidden
Diogenes were speaking ponderously from
within the tub of his body.
The only reply that Tewks could produce
after a long period of stammering was: “Why
not?”
“What’ll you raffle?” went on the inexor-
able Lemmons, staring deeply into his half-
empty glass of claret.
“Well, I could paint a picture,” lamely
suggested Tewks, knowing that he could not
pretend to the possession of anything of
value at home, the whole company having
often searched his room for anything likely
to excite a pawnbroker’s cupidity. After
this suggestion had been treated with the
derision it merited, Tewks sat silent for a
time, while Splitter showed how his spinner
for Put-and-Take was loaded and would
fall either way, according to the direction
the fingers twirled it. By the time his efforts

to auction it had failed, Tewks had evolved
another bright idea.
“Look here, you chaps; this is why I sug-
gested a raffle. Clink and I have written
a musical comedy, and we want the money
to get it typewritten. It’s sure to succeed.
There are several bedrooms, and one scene
with three bathrooms seen in sections on
the stage at the same time. But the Firm
won’t look at anything unless it’s typed,”
and growing lyrical as his power of inven-
tion revealed itself, “Clink here knows a
girl who types, and she’d be willing to do
it cheap if we could give her a bit on
account.”
“Read us the play, and we’ll see what we
think of it,” said O’Swivel. “If it’s any
good we’ll raise the money somehow.”
“As a matter of fact —er —I—er—l’ve
lost it,” confessed Tewks, unable to think
of any other excuse at this unexpected
question. “I wanted some money to adver-
tise in the papers for it.”
O’Swivel burst into hollow laughter. “It’s
no use, base fustian knave,” he mouthed.
“We’ve seen through you. Your thoughts
are as crystal to us, though they themselves
be vile as mud. Are there not enough of
mankind to try your tricks upon without
troubling us Hyperboreans with the paltry
task of unmasking you ? Confess the truth,
or begone from the confines of free men.”
“Make ’em buy ’nother lot of drinks,”
suggested Lemmons with the steady impar-
tiality of a Judge summing-up, while he
turned his empty glass upside down as if
to prove to a doubting world that he had
absorbed every drop of its bounty. “Drinks
or be damned,” he added, as a weighty after-
thought, and resumed his glass-gazing:
Tewks settled this suggestion by produc-
ing ninepence, all he had now left. “As for
you, O’Swivel,” he went on, “I shall not
pander to your low curiosity. The heart
knoweth its own bitterness, and your sug-
gestion that I should bare the secret places
of my soul surprises me.” lie turned an
expression as nauseated as that of the curate
who finds five separate buttons on the plate
upon the sneering countenance of O’Swivel.
“What I really came here for was to sug-
gest that we hold a party the day after to-
morrow at our place. The booking is now
open ; two shillings entrance fee, threepence
more if you wish to go on to the roof.”
The company was sceptical.
“You’ve been trying to get some money
out of us all the time,” said O’Swivel.
“I believe you mean to collect the cash
and not hold the party,” accused Splitter.
“Liars!” boomed Lemmons sepulchrally,
without looking up or otherwise indicating
who were guilty.
“This is too much,” cried Tewks. “Be-
lieve anything else of me; but never, never
as much as hint that I would do away with
money entrusted to me for drinks. Have
we read Rabelais together for nothing?
Have all our efforts towards higher things
come to this—that you think I would divert
from its intended purpose wealth dedicated
to my own and my friends’ thirst? It is
too much !”
Splitter and O’Swivel, out of admiration
for his effectively-assumed grief, admitted
they would let bygones be bygones, and
probably invest in the promised festivities.
Lemmons was cautiously approached, and
after all the others had urged him for some
time he produced the necessary coin, and
fixing a watery eye upon Tewks ejaculated,
“Bewares, I tells you here. Man to man,
and I knows yer.” He was heartily applauded
for this jeu d’esprit, and retired to his
yogi-like contemplation of the glass, mur-
muring indignantly, “Liars!” A few more
friends were summoned from the bar, and
the invitation was passed round.
* * * *
Two days had passed. Tewks and Clin-
ker had raised a few shillings themselves
so that their total cash was somewhere about
17s. 6d. They were grieved to be obliged
to deceive their friends; but they resolved
that when they had sold the Rembrandt
they would atone by a really splendid
bacchanal. In the meantime, they would
buy the picture, leave a valedictory message
on their door and disappear. The business
of deceiving the Hebrew was undertaken by
Tewks.
“He knows you saw it,” he said to Clin-
ker, “so it’ll be better for me to do it. Be-
sides, it may be necessary to beat him down
a bit, and you’re such an ass.” His friend
overlooked the insult, and Tewks went on.
“You stay here and pack up while 1 go
and buy it.”
With an elaborate air of indifference, he
entered the shop, and after offering to the
disgusted Israelite an old picture-frame he
had picked out of a rubbish-tip in his own
yard, he essayed to open a general conver-
sation. No easy matter this, for anyone
sufficiently optimistic or needy to try to sell
such an object as he was carrying, must
obviously be either mad or penniless.
“Got any old canvases I could paint on?”
he asked after examining one or two things
in a disparaging manner, trying desperately
the while to keep his eyes off the coveted
painting. “Any old thing I could paint on
t<vp of,” looking around. “Something like
this,” and he pointed to the masterpiece.
“That’s just about the size I want. How
much’ll you take for it?”
He was unaware that he had betrayed his
preoccupation some time before to the Jew,
who now took the canvas down and pre-
tended to examine it carefully.
“It’s old, my poy, tarn old; and I think
it’s valuable. Vot you give me?”
“Oh, a bob or so,” said Tewks, “the pic-
ture itself’s nothing. I only want the canvas.”
“Veil, vy nod take dis?” and the old man
indicated another painting.
“No, this one is just the shape I want.”
“Veil,” suid the Jew, measuring his cus-
tomer with an assessing eye, and speaking
with a tone of extreme magnanimity, “you
can haf it for five shillinks.”
The delighted Tewks, with great sellf-
control, managed to stand out for three and
ninepence, and, at that figure he eventually
bore the canvas away, while the pawnbroker
stood at his door with an oily leer on his
face, and remained there watching as the
youth rushed up the street.
With a yell Tewks burst into the attic,
leaped at the anxious Clinker and embraced
him. “Got it for three and ninepence,” he
announced breathlessly. “So we’ve about
14 bob left. A little judicious adulteration
in the drink and nobody’ll know that the
full value hasn’t been provided. We needn’t
flee to the hills after all.”
They crawled out on the roof and col-
lected an assortment of bottles of
the better-quality brand. These they
had filled with cheap liquor at an adja-
cent wineshop. They then hung their trophy
and admired it from all angles, remarking
over and over again how a penetrating
chiaroscuro filled all its dark shadows with
a deeply golden light. “We’ll stick a bit of
rag over it,” said Tewks at last, “and when
they’re all here we’ll have an unveiling
ceremony and tell them our fortune is made.”
By seven that evening they were waiting
for their guests and arranging the bottles
and glasses for the nineteenth time. All was
ready, even to the Rabelais, which stood
ready on the table in case it were decided to
hold a reading from it. Filippino, an Italian,
was the first to appear. He had his zither
and relied on his musical genius to ensure
his welcome, though he had paid no sub-
scription. “No room, Garlic,” said Tewks,
“but you can sit on the roof, if you like, and
we’ll hand drinks out to you.” Soon metallic
tunes were floating in through the paneless
window. Two more guests—journalists—-
now entered, and were given seats. A tre-
mendous crash at the last turn of the stairs
was heard. “That must be Lemmons,” said
Tewks. “No one else can fall so solidly;
only Lemmons or an elephant could do it.”
The surmise was correct. Splitter and
O’Swivel appeared, supporting between them
Lemmons, wh'o, having been revived with
wine, stared at the array for some minutes,
during which he was forgotten—till he again
drew the attention of the house to himself
by crying “Liars!” Challenged to be more
explicit he asked, “Why aren’t the bottles
got tops on?”
“Don’t be silly,” said Tewks. “We took
them off so the bottles would be easier to
open. Have a drink?” he added in general
invitation, with the object of blanketing fur-
ther discussion. Soon the wine was flowing
properly; the other two guests arrived; the
zither twanged to the stars, and, coming out
of the night, produced a bizarre effect. Lem-
mons, mystified as to its source, kept look-
ing under the beds and opening the door.
O’Swivel declaimed an ode called “The Vamp
and the Vacuum,” which began nowhere and
ended nowhere; the author explaining that
this was owing to the vacuum. To save
trouble Filippino was given a bottle, and
strange rhythms began to come from the
roof, mixed with the noise of feet trying to
dance on a slanting surface. Lemmons at
last located the sound, and as he was moving
towards the window the struggling form of
the Italian collapsed through it and felled
the investigator to the floor. Trouble was
averted, however. Tewks pushed Filippino
back on to the roof and then assured Lem-
mons that he had gone home. Realising that
the moment for action had now arrived
Tewks moved to the end of the room, where
the picture hung, and raising his voice cried
dramatically, “Hither, friends of my bosom !
I have here a real Rembrandt, rescued by
me from the garbage-tip of oblivion. I will
not recount the arduous pursuit that has
made it mine ; enough that here it stands for
you to wonder at.”
With a florid gesture he pulled the cloth
away, exposing what seemed only a black
surface in the dim light. O’Swivel was the
first to reach it. “A Rembrandt!” he cried.
"Why, I painted it myself.”
A desolating silence followed.
"Yes, that’s mine,” he went on pitilessly.
“I faked the signature as well as I could and
tried it on a few pawnbrokers. Old Abra-
hams very nearly bit. He asked me to let
him have a look at it in a back room; and
while I was waiting bunked out, showed it
to a specialist, and then came back and
laughed at me. In my exasperation, and as
I was also feeling hungry, I sold it to him
for one and threepence, i bet the old beggar
knew all the time what you thought you
were getting”
Tewks’s world crashed in disillusion about
him; tears filled his eyes; he gasped for
breath, and then, bravely, he fought his
way out. “Well, I’ve got some wine out of
the ruins, anyhow,” he mused; and reached
for one of the claret bottles.
And he drank.

Are You as Wei I as
You Should Be?
It isn’t right for one to always feel tired, weak —all worn
out. Yet how many folks are constantly ailing, though
seldom sick enough to be in bed! Are you one of these
unfortunates? Do you suffer daily backaches—feel dull
and weary—nervous and dispirited ? Is your health
slowly slipping away? It’s time, then, you were finding
the cause. Quite likely it’s your kidneys. A cold, strain
, or overwork lias slowed up your kidneys and brought on
that dull, dragging ache that soreness, stiffness, lassitude and weariness. You may have headaches,
dizzy spells and annoying kidney irregularities, too. Don’t wait for serious kidney trouble, but help
the weakened kidneys with Doans Backache Kidney Pills. Doan’s have helped thousands. They
should help you. Ask your neighbor!
A MAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mr. A. H. Francis, 192 Union Street, Erskineville,
Sydney, says: “As the result of an attack of influenza a
member of my family suffered terribly from kidney
trouble. The symptoms were various, the most trouble-
some being pains across the small of the back. This
ailment was very trying, especially so as every move-
ment seemed to make the suffering more acute. No
position was comfortable, the ache keeping up practically
night and day. One day we were advised to try Doan’s
Backache Kidney Fills, and they proved a blessing, six
bottles driving the pain out of the back and restoring the
kidneys to a healthy state. Doan’s Fills are a marvel-
lous kidney remedy, and I am sure sufferers from back-
ache cannot do better than take them. I consider they are
a boon to humanity, and I am never without a bottle in
the house.”
Two years later Mr. Francis says : “The cure referred
to still holds good, no signs of kidney trouble having
returned, a fact that oroves Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills give lasting benefit.”

AND KIDNEY
TROUBLE.
A WOMAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mrs. W. P. Bitzau, 364 King Street, Newtown,
Sydney, says: “For years I was a great sufferer from
kidney disease. I have been treated by doctors and in
hospitals, and tortured with operations. After fifteen
months in one hospital I came out a thorough cripple;
I was so ill I was advised to go back into the hospital,
but my husband would not let me go. I was recommended
by a friend to take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and
commenced using them, carefully following the directions.
These pills have cured me. I can now get about and
do my work, and the pain has completely left me. My
cure is wonderful, for mine was really a very bad case.
Since my cure my uncle has used the remedy and they
have effected a complete cure in his case also. Our
experiences prove that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are
a positive cure for kidney trouble.”
Eight years later Mrs. Kitzau says: “I have still
the same good opinion of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
When I feel a slight return of my old complaint I take
them, and they never fail to put me right.”
