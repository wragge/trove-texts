SOME RECENT BOOKS.
The Intercolonial Press Agency publishes “ The
Dis-Honourable,” a novel by J. D. Hennessey
(boards, 35.), which has all the elements of popu-
larity. Plot and style are commonplace, but the
beat of commonplace. The story has interest;
the treatment is capable and uniform ; and the
characters are not all melodramatic puppets. The
scene is laid at Brisbane ; and the author gives
incidental pictures of the floods of ’93, of the
land-booming politicians who ran the Govt, at
that epoch—a life-like and unflattering sketch,
and of a fairly typical dissenting brotherhood
whose portraits are done with vigor and insight.
Mr. Hennessey has produced one of the most pro-
mising Australian books printed for a long time.
He observes well; describes well ; and has a real
talent for characterisation. “ The Dis-Honor-
able ” is too conventional in essence to have per-
manent value; but some of the figures and inci-
dents are treated with a breadth and originality
that give hope of better things.
H. B. Marriott-Watson is a writer of quaint,
flavoury, old-fashioned prose, all melody and
picturesqueness, which would give distinction
even to ordinary ideas. As Mr. Watson’s ideas
are generally good, his sketches and stories are
uncommonly well worth reading. The episode of
“The Lady’s Chamber,” in the Now Review for
May, for example, is a bit of delicious art which
only “ Q.,” of contemporaries, could parallel.
And in “At the First Corner,” Mr. Watson’s
new book (cloth, 4s. 6d.), out of nine short stories
only the first and last do not impress—the one
merely unpleasant, the other mainly uncon-
vincing. The others range from fine to very fine);
and even their affectation touches the appreciative
palate as a subtle grace.
“ Gallia,” by Mene Muriel Dowie (paper, 3s. ;
cloth, 45.), is another “advanced” book made
around the idea of “ A Superfluous Woman ” that
modern girls do not live by husband alone, but
principally by baby. The husband is a rather
tiresome accessory before the great fact of the
goo-goo machine. The book iias some interest
and no value.
Kidd’s “Social Evolution” is published in a
cheaper edition (cloth, 6s. 6d.), and at that price
is worth buying. The book is suggestive, and a
notable contribution to the literature of revolt
from reason ; though the argument has already
neon described as dogmatic assumption supported
my the merest shell of evidence.
Lovers of Walter Scott should purchase the
'. harming new edition of his works, now pub-
i.fishing in 48 vols. (2s. 6d. each). The edition is
i reprint of the Author’s Favorite Edition, with
all the original plates; and size, type, paper and
i.inding are delightful. Vols. 1 and 2 ( Waverley)
are.to hand; and the others will follow at bi-
monthly intervals.
Grant Allen’s “ Woman Who Did ” (cloth, 4s.
6 1.) is as dull as most books with a purpose. The
surprising vogue it has achieved is due partly to
judicious putting, but chiefly to the attractive im-
propriety of the heroine. Mr. Allen’s statement
that the book was written '* wholly and solely to
satisfy his own taste and conscience” titillates
the reader into curiosity which broadens to
amusement as the chapters pass. The author’s
painful earnestness makes his story solemn ; but
it is not without interest, and it furnishes as a
whole a ponderous anticlimax to his well-meant
dogma.
Lord Wolseley’a “Decline and Fall of Napo-
leon ” (cloth, 3s. Ild.) is a compact and interesting
account of the campaigns from the invasion of
Russia to Waterloo, disfigured by truly British
cant and prejudice.
Allan Menzies’ “ History of Religion ” (cloth,
ss. 6d.) gives “a sketch of primitive religious
beliefs and practices, and of the origin and char-
a -ler of the great systems.” The book is lucid
and comprehensive, and is unusually free from
theological bias.
“The Infant,” by Frederick Wicks (Reming-
ton ; cloth, 6s. 6d.) is a novel of manners and char-
acter which only needs to be half as long and
twice as bright in order to be readable.
Lady Jeune is a plodding essayist who labors
with more or less success to extract suitable morals
from topics of the day. She is not at all a New
Woman ; and her “ Lesser Questions ” (Reming-
ton ; cloth, 45.) is a commentary respectable,
solid, and rather dull.
“ Bimetal!sm,” by H. D. MacLeod (cloth,
6s. 6d.), is mainly an historical review of currency,
with a summing-up in favor of monometallism.
The other side hardly gets fair statement; but the
book has value.
Ouida’s “Views and Opinions ” (paper, 35.;
cloth, 45.) is a weighty and interesting set of
essays on many various subjects. Ouida has
vigor and style, and is full of suggestion.

Medical.
COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Bverton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure. —J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir, —I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it. —Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick,”
Prepared only, and sold wholesale and retail, by
the proprietor, W. G. Hearne, chemist, Geelong,

O XT R s B L V B S!
We wish it to be understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely Inclusive variety of the
xoods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves
PUBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life—honest
itizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
Jr the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
,wm the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in - bold relief- against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but it the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
never cease from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
somewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. . For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

Various Verses.
AT THE WATERFALL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Down in a deep, delightful glen,
On soft, dead leaves I lie—
The loveliest spot I yet have seen
Beneath the southern sky.
I look into dark and dreamy eyes,
And think of their witching power
To make me forget the flight of time
As I idle away the hour.
I’ll describe to you the delightful spot,
And_ I think I hear you say :
“ ’Tis just the place with a charming girl
To loiter away the day.”
There’s a wall of rugged red-brown rocks
O’er which limpid waters flow,
As they hurry along with a life-like leap
To their rest in the pool below ;
And the spray, as soft as a summer mist,
Is caught on the ferns around,
Where fancy sees a water-sprite
Whose hair with pearls is bound.
There are giant trees whose massy trunks
Attest the flight of time.
And lovely flowers to weave a wreath
Around a hat to twine.
As I lie at ease on the leaves and moss
And hold as soft a hand,
I ask no more for an idle hour
And sigh for no fairer land.
There’s an echo like to the vesper bell
I have heard in Italia’s clime —
Tho’ a stranger here I have learned to love
The bell-bird’s liquid chime ;
In varying tones its cadence rings
Through the lazy summer air,
And Music’s soul can claim than this
No melody more rare.
As the evening shadows grow in length
And the golden-rose lights fade,
I think of many as fair a scene
And of many a lovely maid.
I dream of eyes of the deepest blue
And of hair with a golden sheen—-
Of the loving looks and the warm caress
Received from my heart’s first queen.
And then I think of that Spanish girl
With hair like the raven’s wing,
And the bell-birds echo the passionate words
I heard the dark beauty sing;
While the jackass there, with his mocking laugh,
Who sits on the branch above,
Seems to ask me why to that beauty dark
I foolishly spoke of love.
I think of many a fairy scene,
Of ballrooms bright and gay,
And I wish for a dip in Lethe’s stream
To banish thought for aye.
For the golden beauty pined and died
And the dark turned out a shrew.
Ah ! many a sorrow deep I trace
To women. Do not you ?
I heard one breathe the tenderest vows
When she was wishing the while
For a ride with Tom, on an Arab horse
Down that darling “Ladies’ Mile.”
I have looked into eyes and truly felt
That Heaven’s whole truth was there,
When she was thinking “ was that blue dress
Becoming enough to wear?”
But a truce to this ! lam wiser now
And bask in a sunny smile,
Without enquiring whether the girl
Is thinking of me the while.
I like very much for a little hand
To caress and arrange my hair, ,
But I look on a woman and treat her just
As a flower rich and rare.
And as here I lie, on the soft dead leaves
And list to the bell-bird’s song,
I truly hope that my fate may not
Tie me to a woman long.
Sydney.

A VISION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A cursed dream it was of light and dark,
Of ice-bound bodies retching sheets of flame,
Of fair souls shivering with secret shame ;
And others sudden stripped of splendor, stark,
Disclosed black hell-hounds whose thin hideous
bark
Ran trembling through the ink-depths as it came
Waking wild imprecations on a name,
Till shudd’ring Silence gasped an awful “ Hark !”
And Terror labored in that pregnant time,:
While Chaos leashed his thunders in his’hand—
Waiting a signal. Then, in whisper shrill,
“Life, Sin, or Death?” I questioned; but the
slime
Of horrors vanished from the wakening land—
Leaving its problem damned unanswered still.
N.S. Wales.
HESKETH.
A COUNTRY MAID.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
. I meb a dainty country lass ;
The wind had kissed her cheek to flame ;
3he stepped, aside to let me pass,
- And dropped her eyes in maiden shame.
“ A pretty maid in lonely wood
Is sweet temptation to the blood.’’
Her age was eighteen years, she said.
Too young to wander all alone !
Ah. no, the rugged pathway led
Unto her native village soon,
, “ A pretty maid in lonely wood
Is sweet temptation to the blood.”
She blushed and lingered, sweetly grave,
I praised her eyes, and sighed adieu—
A merry, mocking smile she gave,
And down the forest swiftly flew.
“ A pretty maid in lonely wood
Is sweet temptation to the blood.”

W IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
E beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “ Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-out No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. I,’’ have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ THREE CASTLES ” and “ CAPSTAN.”
We have declined to. conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the interest of
cigarette smokers in New South Whales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
II ills’ “Three Castles’ ’ and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
Tliree Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

SATURDAY, JULY 20, 1895.
Shoddy.
The great soul of the Victorian Assembly
has been roused to hysteria by the discovery,
or alleged discovery, that much of the
tweeds, flannels and other so-called woollen
goods of local manufacture are shoddy of
the shoddiest description. The press and
.the people of Melbourne and other towns
joined in the commotion, and for many days
and nights the shoddy upheaval raged with-
out ceasing. The Argus denounced the im-
position as another consequence of the blast-
ing influences of Protection, and pointed
out with much eloquent raving that when
local industries were fostered by a tariff such
results were inevitable. The Single-tax
organ published photographs of various
alleged samples of local flannel, said to be
nearly one-half cotton, and drew the same
lame and strabismused inference. Murray
Smith’s little band of Freetraders laid down
on the table of the House specimens which
they said they had been told were of local
workmanship, and which they stated, on
their own unsupported authority, to be
largely bogus and cotton ; and were of
opinion that, as these were the results
of Protection, Protection ought to be
abolished. Sundry weak and thick-headed
Protectionists admitted that their fiscal
view's were very much modified by
these painful revelations. And finally
the Assembly, to express its horror at
shoddy, and to prevent the continuance of
the evil, made a considerable reduction in
the duty on woollen goods generally. All
of which is a fine specimen of the stupidity
and logical incapacity of the average legis-
lator, and his ability to make a fool of
himself at the shortest notice.
« * «
Nothing at all was proved in the course of
all this discussion. About the most terrify-
ing collection of samples was produced by a
Freetrade member who stated that he had
procured the dreadful evidence of crime from
a firm of Melbourne importers. No absolute
proof was advanced that they were really of
Victorian manufacture, save the statement
of a biassed politician that a firm with
a special interest in destroying the local in-
dustry had told him so ; and there was no
re: 1 evidence of the alleged adulteration save
that the same member had been informed of
it by the same unreliable authority. Another
excited politician came down with another
awful example in the shape of a garment
which, he asserted, he had found marked
“all wool” in a warehouse. The fact that
he had found it there, that it was a local
production, and that it was so labelled, all
rested on his own bald assertion, and the
House was too badly excited to notice that
there was no positive evidence of its quality,
and that, even if everything else was granted,
it was the dishonest retailer who was directly
responsible for the label upon it, and no one
had even attempted to prove that the manu-
facturer sold it for anything save what it
really was, whatever that might be. Hardly
any of the samples were supported by any
authentic evidence as to their origin, or
their real composition, and the proceedings
were a confused howl rather than an inquiry.
# # •
But despite this want of reliable evidence
to begin with, it may safely be assumed that
many of the Victorian woollen products
commonly so-called, are largely shoddy. It
may be so assumed—-firstly, because the fact
has been known for many years, and,
secondly, because they couldn’t be otherwise
under the circumstances. An enormous pro-
portion of the goods imported from England
and elsewhere are shoddy of the worst des-
cription. There are among them blankets
made of 90 per cent, cotton and one-tenth
wool, alleged tweeds of the same composi-
tion, alleged flannels that are 70 per cent,
vegetable fibre, and other deceptions. These
are exceedingly cheap because they are made
by people who work long hours for low wages,
and because the cost of the raw materials is
small ; and they are permitted to be sold in
Victoria, as pure woollen goods, by any
fraudulent importers and dealers who feel so
inclined. Other cheap varieties, however,
are sold without any false pretence at all.
There is a demand for many different grades
of material at different prices, and many of
these materia’s are not pure wool, for the
simple reason that they were never in-
tended to be. If the Victorian mills deal in
wool only, then the supply of nearly a
dozen different varieties of flannels alone
must be left entirely to the importers. The
importers first created the demand, and the
demand being there the local manufacturers
naturally endeavor to supply it. To assume
that they don’t is absurd, and to profess
that they shouldn’t do it is simply to
profess that a woollen manufacturer should
be- something too pure and spotless fur this
earth. Also, the aspect of righteous in-
dignation assumed by the little knot of
Freetraders was altogether misplaced ; there
would be just as much reason for horror at
the discovery that a Victorian furniture-
maker supplied ugly and umesthetic-looking
pine tables to meet the demand for cheap
and nasty furniture, instead of turning
out only high-class goods in walnut and
mahogany.
* « •
It may also be assumed that some of the
shoddy which is produced by the Victorian
mills is sold by the dishonest wholesale and
retail dealer as pure material. Considering
that the same wholesale and retail dealers
notoriously sell much imported shoddy for
what it is not, they are hardly likely to do
otherwise with the native material. And
considering that the importers of Melbourne,
like those of other cities, consist largely of
dealers in bogus goods, persons who have
been convicted of notorious frauds against
the Customs, ex-directors of fraudulent
boom-banks, and people who have com-
pounded with their creditors for one fink
in the £ —in other words, thac their standard
of commercial morality is much the same as
that of other people—the alleged samples of
local shoddy which they furnished to various
Foreign-trade M.’sP. are just as unreliable
evidence as the testimony of any other in-
terested parties of doubtful character. Also,
the little party of Foreign-trade members on
whose statements the furore mostly rested
are probably just as reliable as other poli-
ticians—whatever that may amount to.
And, furthermore, the Victorian woollen
manufacturers have probably just about as
much honesty as other manufacturers—a
doubtful quantity at the best. But the mere
fact that they produce shoddy amounts to
absolutely nothing, unless it can be proved
that their inferior goods are sold under false
pretences, and that they, and not the
dealers, are responsible for these false pre-
tences. Neither of these points was proved
in any legal sense.
# m •
The attitude taken up by the Murray
Smith party and the Argus was practically
this : (1) It is not a fraud, nor even a matter
to be mentioned with regret, that the worst
description of shoddy should be made in
England under a Freetrade system, and
imported into Australia, nor does that
trade call for repression, or even inquiry.
(2) It is, however, an offence of the worst
description that a somewhat less objection-
able class of goods should be manufactured
in Victoria under a protective policy. (3)
The fact that there is a demand for certain
goods which are invariably made of a mixture
of wool and cotton counts for nothing ;
for some inscrutable reason these goods
must not be made in a Protectionist
country, and this branch of trade must
be supplied by importers only. And (4)
even the fact that no proof w is advanced
of any fraud on the part of the manufacturers
themselves makes no difference. The busi-
ness of a protected manufacturer, according
to the bright lexicon of the Murray Smith
party, is to pay his workpeople nearly twice
the wages paid in England ; to work them
much shorter hours ; to sell pure woollen
goods at prices as low as those charged for
imported articles that are 80 or 90 per cent,
cotton ; and to be denounced as a curse to
the community if he does these things, and
as a commercial swindler if he dues not.
* • •
Possibly if anybody had been sufficiently
calm to search forany real evidence against the
said manufacturer it would have been proved
that he —or a considerable part of him at all
events —is a commercial swindler. Protec-
tion doesn’t even profess to make men honest
any more than does Freetrade or revenue-
tariffism, and no one in his senses ever
dreamt that it would do so. If the protected
manufacturer finds a favorable opportunity
to swindle the public, and the swindle looks
sufficiently profitable, he is as likely to avail
himself of it as any other man. If it is to
his interest to make his alleged woollen goods
wholly out of cotton, and there is rio law- to
send him to gaol for so doing, and there is
any reasonable chance to escape detection, he
will most probably do it. But, even if he was
proved to have done so, it is not in any
sense an argument against Protection, and it
no more shows that that fiscal system should
be abolished . than the many recent bank
frauds show that ban king should be abolished,
or than the Customs frauds of which so many
importers have been convicted show that
importing should be wholly prohibited. If
the fact that a manufacturer who exists in a
protected country is dishonest in his dealings
is a reason why Protection should be done
away with, then the fact that a banker is dis-
honest in a Freetrade community is an
equally convincing proof that Freetrade
should be put down at once and for ever.
Also, the fact that anybody defrauds any-
body else in a country where revenue is
raised by a land-tax is a similarly re-
liable evidence that the land-tax re-
quires to be wiped out. Meanwhile
Premier Turner has been so much im-
pressed by the recent “ revelations ” that a
bill is shortly to be introduced prohibiting
the sale of shoddy unless it is distinctly
marked and branded as such. This measure
will be wholly admirable if it deals in abso-
lutely equal measure with the importer and
the manufacturer—if it scoops in the person
who sells high-class Victorian goods as
English, and low-grade foreign goods as
Victorian, or vice versa —and if it is so framed
as to exercise an equally careful supervision
in every case. But a great effort will be
made to apply its restrictions principally, if
not wholly, to the local factories, and any
such attempt needs to be closely watched
and promptly suppressed. It is not the dis-
honest shoddy ot local manufacture which
wants to be extinguished, but dishonest
shoddy in general.
The Ethics of Oscar.
The Bulletin has received many letters from
intelligent persons who deny the right of the
community to gaol Oscar Wilde for an offence
which, in order to “depolarise ” it for purposes
of debate, may be called galvanised-iron. The
argument may be shortened by excluding from
consideration whether brilliant abnormality (of
the Wilde type) stands on a higher footing
than dull normality.; whether a community,
some of whose members commit unhindered
possibly worse offences than galvanised-iron, is
justified in “punishing” galvanised-iron dealers;
and whether, supposing the community’s action
justified, the best or fairest treatment for gal-
vanised-iron dealers is per gaol, or per asylum,
or per some other means of community-protec-
tion or individual-reformation. The questions
for settlement are, therefore: Is galvanised-
iron an anti-social act ? Has the community an
ethical right to deal as it pleases with those who
commit anti-social actions ?
« * *
To the first question, the obvious answer is
that the social character of any act must, in
the last resort, be determined by the com-
munity ; and, as galvanised-iron has been
determined to be an anti-social act, to all com-
munity-intents and purposes it is an anti-social
act. But, going deeper, the community’s
decision is justified. Could it be proved that
the results of galvanised-iron were confined to
Wilde himself and his accomplices, and sup-
posing these accomplices to be of sufficiently
mature age to warrant the community in
leaving them to take the responsibility of their
acts, it might be held that the community is
wrong. But no such proof was given ; and the
weight of presumption is all the other way.
Individual experience justifies the belief that
in such cases precept and example have a strong
influence; historical experience justifies the
belief that galvanised-iron is a manifestation of
the degeneracy which saps the life of a nation.
In other words, the effect of galvanised-iron
could not practically be confined to Wilde and
his responsible assistants—if they were all
responsible; and galvanised-iron ' has a per-
nicious influence on the community. An in-
duction of the facts on which this conclusion is
based cannot here be made; but probably few
students will disagree,
# # *
The second question will bear more extended
argument. It is premised that no notice need
be taken of the “ morality ” or “ immorality,”
in the cant sense, of galvanised-iron. There,is‘
no absolute standard of morality. Says a
recent writer: Probably “there is-no crime,
recognised by us as such, which has hot some-
where and at some time .found its plane in the
catalogue of virtues, and no virtue which has
not been officially condemned. The,murderous
Fijian’s only fear is lest he should not be active
enough in slaughter to win the approbation of
his gods ; with the Egyptian, lying is honor-
able ; while the Turkoman’s code of moral
injunctions prescribes theft. Polygamy, wrong
in Europe and America, is right and proper in
China, India, and Turkey ; while infanticide, a
practice that we hold in utter abhorrence, was
not only common in Greece and Rome, but was
even justified by the greatest ethical teachers
of antiquity, Plato and Aristotle, who also
held views concerning the relations of the sexes-
which we should look on as revolting.”
• • *
What is moral and immoral is practically
fixed for every man by the majority-sentiment
of the community into which he happens to be
born. Ned Kelly, for example, was hung for
conduct which would have won him esteem
from the freebooters of William the Norman.
At any time, for any individual, the measure of
rectitude or turpitude in his actions is practi-
cally the measure of the majority which ap-
proves or condemns them. In other words,
might is right—practically.
• • »
But might is not right ethically, absolutely.
A thing is not essentially wrong because at any
given time a majority of people in Australia,
or America, or Europe, believe it to be wrong.
For we have only to change place and time to
be nearly sure of finding a country where a
majority of people deem that thing right and
lawful. That is to say, a majority-opinion is
no absolute test of ethical quality. The morality
of any given majority is doubtless moral for the
individuals who compose that majority, but it
is immoral for the minority, and it may be
immoral for the majority in the same country
at another time, or in another country at the
same time.
* * *
The only rational standard of ethics is well-
being. What helps or benefits or pleases the
individual is right for him : what injures or dis-
pleases him is wrong. And to every individual
must be conceded the right to know what he
wishes or does not wish. Similarly, what helps
the community is right for the community :
what hurts it is wrong. And to the community
or its majority must be conceded the right to
know what it wishes or does not wish.
* * #
Ethically, every man may be considered from
two points of view : first, in relation to himself;
second, in relation to others. As an individual,
he has the right to act as he pleases ; though as
a member of society, if the society is to exist,
he can be permitted to act as he pleases only so
long as his actions are not prejudicial to the
society. The quality of morality or immorality,
right or wrong, cannot inhere in any act of the
individual considered as an isolated integer.
Morality is a matter of relationships to time,
place, and circumstances ; and the individual
per se has no relationships. The Bible says
that with Adam came sin into the world : it
would be more correct to say that sin came in
with the community. The first man could not
possibly commit a crime—even against himself;
since his own will and pleasure was the sole,
standard of right and wrong which existed..
The last man will be in similar case—the only
measure of the morality of his acts will be his,;
power to act; and, as he cannot act where he- :
is impotent, it follows that, in kingly phrase,
he “ can do no wrong.”
# # •
Thus, considering the individual as a member •
of society, he is immoral only when he is anti-
social. From the individual’s point of view, he ■
need not be immoral even then, and ethically
there is no certainty that he is. Practically,.
however, the force of the majority leaves the;
individual no room for debate ; and it is true ■
that, if the individual has the right to defend I
himself against the community, the community
has at least as much right to defend itself
against the individual, and, if necessary, to-
attack the individual. The sole justification)
which it needs is proof that the individual is-j
doing something dangerous to its well-being..
• « »
Thus the answer to the second question is
also affirmative. Summed up: There is no
fixed cognisable standard of absolute right.
The best cognisable standard is that of well-
being. Every individual or community has the
right to fix his or its own standard of well-
being. When the standard of the individual
conflicts with that of the pommunity, the pre-
sumption is that the community is at least as
ethically right as the individual. Therefore,
the community has just as much ethical right
to enforce its standard as the individual has to
enforce his. And as, practically, the com-
munity is stronger than the individual, when
there is conflict the individual generally goes
under. Oscar Wilde has gone under.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Kanakaland Contest.
Up North, the Boodlewraith party is working
for the coming elections with the vigor and
ingenuity of the Devil himself. The contest
cannot be deferred beyond the beginning of
’96 : it is more likely to come at the end of this
year. Whenever Boodlewraith feels fittest,
and judges its opponents most unfit, the poll
will be sprung upon them. During the past,
nine months the rolls have been steadily “ bul-
cocked ”--f.e., the electors Rave been canvassed
one by one, the tendencies and antecedents of
each noted and registered, and every possible
dodge,' legal and illegal, has been tried to dis-
■ fraupiuS'c known or suspected opponents of the
'The work of enrolling “good men,”"
witliVor without qualification, has continuously
gone forward; and the “bad men” have
found officials strangely forgetful or strongly
hindering when they pressed their claims,
for a vote. ..The Govt, is run as a party-
electoral organisation, and “the authori-
ties ” preside over the property league
which strives; by hook or crook, to dis-
franchise every laboring elector. Democrats
qualified by 20 years’ residence in the same
spot have received official demands to make
oath anew to their qualifications—for no ap-
parent reason but the whim of an electoral
registrar, behind whom the National Ass is.
ambushed. Fat-men enrolled in the Fat alliance -


have suddenly discharged employes who, finding
no work handy, have had to tramp ; while their
places have been filled by men from another part
of the province. Thus two sets of possible anti-
boodle voters are disfranchised for six months,
until a residence qualification is again acquired.
Every labour-elector who can be “ moved on ”
is being “ moved on ” —to lose his vote ; while
those who can’t be “ moved on ” are mys-
teriously “moved off”—off the electoral-roll.
This policy has already been so successful that
Boodlewraith has high hopes of returning to
office. It is simply a question of the number
of honest men in the province ; and the Govern-
ment believes that a majority are either
naturally dishonest or can be bribed or coerced
into dishonesty. The democrats have only one
chance —a coalition between the Labour-party
and the Opposition. As long as the Labour-
party persists in its policy of extremes it will
achieve nothing. When it drops theory for
practical utility, when it is content to take
what it can get instead of waiting for what it
wants, it should succeed—as the Labour-party
has succeeded in Maoriland. “ Socialism — i.e.,
Collectivism—in our time ” is a chimera. In
pursuing it the Q. Labour-party sacrifices, and
will continue to sacrifice, substance for shadow.
The N.S.W. Fiscal Issue.
The present fiscal issue in New South Wales
can be put in a few w'ords, somewhat as
follows : The province had nearly a century of
Freetrade. The Freetrade epoch covered the
great land-sale period when all the eastern
districts were disposed of. It covered the
great borrowing period, when the loan-money
was rolling in at the rate of from .£1,000,000 to
£5,800,000 per annum, and the date of repay-
ment was still far off. It included the great
gold era, when the annual output was occasion-
ally over £2,000,000, instead of about one-
quarter of that amount as at present. And it
extended over the silver-boom days ; and the
era of private borrowing, when foreign capital
was still coming in fast, and the interest
thereon had not become so great a burden
as it now is ; and the era of high prices, when
the province’s exports of raw material fetched
in London from 20 to 60 per cent, more
than they now do. Then the province had
three years of partial Protection. The first,
1892, was the year when the first large
loan fell due and when the London financiers
flatly refused to lend, for about the first time in
Australia’s history. The second, 1893, was the
year of the great financial collapse. And all
three were the years when Australian exports
realised all round the lowest prices in London
ever recorded. Also it was in this period that
Japan began to annex the foreign coal-trade of
Newcastle, and Victoria began to be indepen-
dent of New South Wales supplies, and the
great Broken Hill strike took place. And
the case against Protection is that it did
not produce much better results in these direful
years, and after only 36 months’ trial, than the
Foreign-trade policy produced after it had
existed for a century, through all the halcyon
days of the province’s history. This is the
New South Wales fiscal question put in the
very smallest space up to date.

Some Dreary Statistics.
Sydney Telegraph has invented a new and
very inaccurate correspondent, Mr. J. A.
Stanley Adam, evidently an Englishman, and
apparently a new-chum, who writes a long
letter almost every day on the horrors of Pro-
tection in New South Wales. The following is
a sample :
How do the number of manufactories in existence and
the number of hands employed in 1894 compare with the
figures for the years prior to the imposition of the Dibbs
tariff? According to the Government statist, there were
2647 works in existence in New South Wales last year,
against 2583 in 1891, and 3541 in 1887. As compared with
1891 there was an increase of 64 works of one kind or
another; the total number of hands employed in these
factories was 42,751 in 1894, against 46,135 in 1891, a drop
of 3384. But for the rapid development of the boiling-
down, tanning, and wool-scouring industries, which
owe nothing to the tariff, the drop would have
been much greater. In 1891 there were only 273
hands engaged in the boiling - down establishments
against 1715 in 1894 ; 897 were engaged in the tan-
neries in 1891, against 1130 last year ; and 842 in wool-
scouring, against 1246. The total number of hands
engaged in the boot factories last year was 3420, as com-
pared with 2806 in 1891, an increase of 614. Curiously
enough, however, the smaller number of hands turned
out more pairs of boots in 1891, under Freetrade, than the
larger number did in 1894, under 10 per cent. Protection.
The output in the former year was 2,634,254 pairs, and in
the latter 2,611,700. As regards hats and caps—protected
by a 10 per cent, duty—there were only 10 hands engaged
in the manufacturing industry last year, against 74 in
1891. Ever since the duty was imposed the number of
hands employed in this industry has fallen year by year,
the numbers being—lß9l, 74; 1892,26 ; 1893, 14 ; and 1894,
10. As to the ready-made clothing trade—also protected by
10 per cent—Mr. Coghlan shows that while it afforded
work to 2698 persons in 1891, it could only maintain 1466
in 1894. In 1891, the biscuit factories employed 504
hands ; last year—with a duty of 2d. per lb.—the number
fas 479. In 1890 there were 497 hands employed in
making confectionery—duty, 2d. per lb.—and 359 in 1891;
last year the figures were 380. The wire-workers in 1891
totalled 170, and 169 in 1894. Furniture-making gave
■ work to 1064 people in 1891, and to 716 last year. Coach-
I builders represented 1486 workers in 1891, but only 1224
;in 1894. There were 483 hands employed in making
, saddlery and harness in 1891, and 324 in 1894.
Figures don’t lie, but a great deal depends on
how they are exhibited. The following is
.practically the same batch of figures the other
- way up : In 1885 there were 3541 “ factories or
-works” in New South Wales, and by 1891 the
inumber had decreased to 2583, nearly 1000
\works having closed up in six years of Free-
'trade. In 1894, after three years of Protection,
they had increased to 2647, or an advance of
64. There has been, since 1891, a decrease of
3384 in the number of employes in factories,
but the statement that the enormously in-
creased employment in tanneries “ owes
nothing to the tariff” is unabashed lying. The
business in this line remained almost stationary
for many years, until the 10 per cent, duty was
imposed in 1891, since which date the imports
of leather have decreased by £32,000 and the
exports have increased by £90,000. Also, the
boom in the boiling-down industry, which em-
ployed 273 hands in 1891 and 1715 in 1894, is
partly owing to the improved local market
for hides created by the protective tariff. The
decrease of 3384 in the number of employes is
chiefly accounted for by the fact that 3216 less
people are employed in six industries which
were unaffected by the tariff changes of 1891,
brickmakers, joiners, plasterers, and railway
workshop employes accounting for most of the
decline. This collapse in the freetrade indus-
tries of the province is significant. The number
of employes in the hat and cap trade fell, as
stated, by 64 in three years of Protection ; it
also fell by 67 in two previous years of Free-
trade—in fact, it has fallen continuously since
1885. Probably it wasn’t sufficiently pro-
tected. As Mr. Stanley Adamsliow's, the confec-
tionery industry has improved materially since
1891, though it has very little to do with the
case, the duty being an old one of many years
standing. In 10 important industries which
were protected by the ’9l tariff', employment
has increased very largely. The first year of
Protection showed an increase of 700 em-
ployes; the third (1894) showed an in-
crease of nearly 4000, the largest ever
recorded in New South Wales. In between
there was an awful drop of 8000 during the
bank-smash year of ’93, but Protection is no
more responsible for that tremendous laud-boom
collapse than Freetrade is for Jabez Balfour’s
bank. Yet, despite this unforeseen disaster,
the protective period compares very well, on
the whole, with the Foreign-trade period which
went before it. Out of the 45 New South
Wales industries enumerated by Coghlan,
there was, during the Foreign-trade period
1885-91, a decrease of 5890 employes in 25
separate industries, and nine others had a total
increase of 37 hands among them. The only
increases of importance were in Government
employes, gas - works employes, builders,
engineers and printers, who are not exposed
to foreign competition, but in almost every
competitive industry there was decay and a
general fading away.
An Accusing Voice.
The following letter from Mr. Arthur Grif-
fith, M.L.A. (N.S.W.), speaks for itself; —
Parliament House, Sydney, 12th July, 1895.
Editor Bulletin,—l! you see fit to use all your influ-
ence, at the present juncture, to injure the cause of Land
taxation and the Referendum, by continually throwing'
mud at the men who are fisfhtinjt for these measures, that
is your own business. But even this liberty must be sub-
ject to some sort of limitation, and, when in your anxiety
to besmirch some political party you pass into the region
of deliberate mis-statement, it is time for protest.
I am referring now to your statement that Crick’s Bill
to place Kanakas, Japanese, etc., under the same restric-
tions as the Chinamen, was oast out by 38 votes to 20
the majority being composed of Ministerialists and a
portion of the Labor-pirty. This statement is a lie. It
is not even a cleverly constructed falsehood, but a dull,
ponderous, stupid lie, worthy of the Star, and not at all
up to Bulletin standard !
Of course you know perfectly well that Crick’s Bill was
never Before the House—that even the resolution asking
permission to introduce it was not reached on the business
paper, and that the 38 to 20 division was on a mere catch-
penny motion of adjournment asking the House to throw
out the Govermnentfor simply compelling Mr. Crick tO'
place his Bill among those of other private members.
I have not the least hope that you will publish this
letter, but I do expect that you will at least have the
grace to withdraw your mis-statements in this matter.
1 am, &c., Arthur Griffith.
In reply to which The Bulletin distinctly re-
fuses to withdraw anything, and denies Mr.
Griffith’s assertions from first to last. The
situation is as follows: In October, ’94, the
New South Wales Assembly declared by a solid
majority that steps should be taken to exclude
colored labor. The Government has ignored
the instruction up to date, despite alarming re-
ports about the nigger influx in the Northern
districts. Under these circumstances, Crick,
M.L.A., submitted a bill in three clauses to
put the black alien under the same restrictions
that have worked so well in the case of the
Chinaman, which measure could, with Govern-
ment assistance, have been passed through tlm
Assembly in a few hours. It was blocked for
w’ant of that assistance, and when the dissolu-
tion was announced, and all chance of
carrying it this session without Ministerial aid
was over, Crick brought his measure before
the House in the only way which the rules and
regulations permitted. There was no question
about throwing out the Ministry ; the Reid
Cabinet has been defeated over and over again,
notably over the Local Government Bill, and
hasn’t gone out one inch. The Bill might not
be formally before the House, but it was
there informally—as much there as circum-
stances would allow. In reply to Crick,
Premier Reid denounced his action as a “ dirty
political move,” and refused to assist his
measure in any way, and yet gave no promise
that the Government would take the matter up
within any reasonable period, and, at the divi-
sion, he was supported by a strong Freetrade
and Labor majority, which practically voted
for the continuance and extension of black
labor so long as it suited Reid’,s convenience.
Under these circumstances, The Bulletin
declines to retract anything, despite Mr.
Griffith’s truculent attitude in the matter.
The rest of that gentleman’s accusation is that
this paper refused to tell glozing lies, or to
meanly suppress the truth, about Reid’s ruinous
fiscal policy, and his shameful manipulation of
the finances, and his Loan Bill, and other
matters, because he advocates a land-tax—in
other words, that because he promises a good
thing in the remote future, it should approve of
all the bad things he is doing in the immediate
present, and encourage him to keep on doing
them. A year or two ago another politician
remonstrated in the same strain, his plea being
that, for the sake of Protection, this paper
should say nothing about Dibbs’s title, and the
Broken Hill trials, and Lyne’s scheme for sell-
ing the State railways, and various other
matters. The Bulletin hasn’t got sufficiently
low down to oblige either of these gentlemen,,
and it declines to buy Mr. Griffith’s approval
on such terms. Moreover, as that gentleman
twice voted on the Local Government Bill
against the Reid Ministry, thereby endangering
the land and income tax, the referendum, local
government, and the Ministry itself, he is the
very last windy person who has a right to strike
ridiculous attitudes, because The Bulletin
does much less than he did and for a much
better reason.
The Insensible Abrahams.
Six years ago the Vic. Full Court quashed the
conviction of one Fitzgerald, a perjurer, upon
the ground that the Judge, whilst absent from
tbe court, had communicated with the jury on
a matter material to one of the issues being
tried. The jury seat a message asking advice,
and his Honor’s answer repeated what he had
previously said in open court, but inasmuch as
this communication didn’t pass in the presence
of the prisoner and his counsel it was held to
be fatal to the old trial, and a new one was
ordered. Justice Higinbotham dissented from
the finding of four colleagues (Justice Williams
among them) on this law* point, but one dis-
sentient in a Full Court is the least that can be
expected. Five Judges are seldom unanimous.
The decision of the large majority in this case
was unobjectionable from all points of view. A
Judge ought not to direct any portion of a trial
from somewhere round the corner, and nobody
should be away from court at a moment when his
absence would provide grounds for one of those
hollow objections by which justice is delayed
or upset. Clearly, there was a lesson sticking
out from the case of the accused Fitzgerald,
in April, 1889. It showed to the Law the
necessity for laying down a hard and fast rule
which would prevent the possibility of a similar
accident occurring again—a rule ordering the
clerk, or the Judge’s associate, or the crier, or
any other minor official, to see that everybody
who should be in court was actually there at
given times. But since such a rule would close
one little avenue of approach to new trials and
more costs it wasn’t demanded by the lawyers,
neither did the public demand it, because they
are, generally speaking, appalled by legal
fiddlededee and incapable of thinking for them-
selves. So the case of Fitzgerald was adopted
as a convenient precedent, and stowed away in
the dark recesses of legal crookedness until
somebody might want to use it to quash another
conviction. The long-waited-for opportunity
came last week, when four brothers Abrahams
were convicted of conspiracy to swindle the
gun-buyers of Melbourne. The Abrahams
quartette took to fainting and being carried out
of Court so often that at last one of them
wasn’t present when something “ material to
the issue ” occurred in Court. Therefore,
counsel Gaunson, on behalf of another Abra-
hams, bided his time for mentioning that the
trial had gone bung. The presiding Judge—
the same Justice Williams of 1889—feebly
remarked that his attention ought to have been
called to the absence of an Abrahams when
the trial was in danger of degenerating into a
farce, although he had only the Law to blame
for not having appointed somebody to that.
duty. An appeal to the Full Court against the
Abrahams’ conviction seems bound to be up-
held. Judge Williams helped to hatch the
chicken of precedent, and the ridiculous bird is
just now roosting on his wig.
A Comprehensive Flogging Clause.
The flogging clause proposed by Cooke,
M.L.C., to be added to the Victorian Gaols Act
Amendment Bill, provides that the visiting
justices may sentence “ any male prisoner,
aged 16 or upwards, convicted of an assault
upon or attempt to do any bodily injury to any
officer of any gaol ” to be “once or twice pri-
vately whipped.” Each whipping is to consist
of not more than 25 lashes. The whole con-
cludes with this very comprehensive and sug-
gestive clause :
For the purposes of this section the word officer shall
include and refer to the Inspector-General and any deputy
or assistant Inspector-General, and even' governor,
gaoler, keeper or officer in charge of any gaol or hulk,
and every medical officer, overseer, warder, storekeeper,
matron, nurse or person whether permanently, tempor-
arily or occasionally employed in or about any gaol or
hulk, and any member of the police force, and any person
engaged in the conveyance of any persons or goods to or
from any gaol or hulk, and any justice visiting any gaol
or hulk.
If this unspeakable amendment becomes law,.
there is hardly a breach of prison discipline
that cannot be brought within its octopus
grip. The excited prisoner on his way
from the court to the gaol may shake his
fist (legally an assault) at a policeman, and
thereupon find himself liable t 0.50 lashes ! The
semi-delirious gaol-hospital patient may attack
his nurse, and thereupon find himself liable to
50 lashes. The careless prisoner shovelling
stones into a dray may accidentally land a
shovelful upon the head of the ungaoled driver,
and thereupon find himself liable to 50 lashes.
The unlucky wretch cleaning up on a balcony
above a corridor may inadvertently drop a floor-
cloth on a supercilious visiting-official’s head,
and thereupon find himself liable to 50 lashes.
These suggested possibilities are not far-fetched,
for it must be remembered that the prisoner is
powerless against his keepers. They only have
to get him “ set,” and then, upon offering the
least pretence, he is in danger of all the vials of
■official vengeance. If the “ cat ” is of the vials,
then he is in danger of that. The justices
generally do exactly what the officials require.
Prison punishments should be rigidly defined
and confined to the narrowest limits. If any-
thing beyond them is considered necessary the
alleged offender should be taken into the open
courts of justice.
Federation; A Protest.
Dear Bulletin, —What’s the use of continually
whipping the moribund horse—Federation ?
Outside a few professional mouthers, a sec-
tion of politicians and press which sees
in the subject material for heroic plati-
tudes, or a more crafty section which
finds it an opportune red-herring, and The
Bulletin, the people of New South Wales do
not care a rap about Federation —at pre-
sent. The bush folks, I know, do not, and the
city feeling on the recent border railway-rates
fiasco is one more evidence of how Sydney
commercialism views the matter. You know
and have set forth some of the material diffi-
culties, amongst which the financial adjustment
looms large, but I think you scarcely realise
the strong provincial jealousy in the Australian
character which will not be fully manifested
till the practical details are discussed, or
till Federation is consummated and the
strain of new conditions is felt. As you
will probably admit, an immediate Federation
could only be a partial one, and a partial
Federation would be peculiarly liable to dis-
ruption, and how difficult would it be to again
federate after a re-action ? The motive circum-
stances surrounding the only Federation to
which ours has any analog3 r —the American
yUniou—are entirely wanting. There is no per-
sonality now to the fore which can appeal to
all the Australias and surmount the tremendous
difficulties which confront union, and not till
we have an ideal Democracy with ideal machi-
nery can such a leader be dispensed \tith. Fot
an occasion like this, one commanding pet-
sonality is more forceful than a score of medio-
crities. There is no outside pressure —no “ us
against the world ” to raise the white-heat
of patriotism which would annihilate our
petty, but deep-rooted, provincial prejudices.
No menace to rouse the fundamental in-
stinct of self-preservation ! The great factor
in the Canadian Federation is also lacking—we
have no America alongside. We know that
Federation must come. That it is a desirable
consummation we can agree, hut —is it desirable
in the present state of Australian feeling, and
is it safe with our present class of politicians
and “ leaders ? ” Note the ennobbled crowd who
are pulling the strings, and think of the
MTlwraith and Republican Dibbs, and ■
answer ! With such a gang in power —and
they would be, for though the constituencies
be altered the constituents are the same—we
should have an era of Imperial jingoism and
militarism. With subservient Ministries of
Canadian and Australian Federations, and
Cecil Rhodes as Emperor of South Africa, the
Imperial wire-pullers would, with tiie arts so
successful in the past with the same men, con-
summate that Imperial Federation which is to
bulldoze the colonies into shoring up the decay-
ing greatness of England. Had we not better
“ mark time ” till we have a prospect of getting
the men who will voice the growing Australian
sentiment: “Let the dead bury their dead.
What is that to us !” Surely you are, for once,
a little out of touch in advocating so persistently
an immediate Federation. Missionise by all
means, educate us for the time when we can
“ take occasion by the hand”—but don’t assist
the “shelving” politicians in delaying those
many useful little things which are so momen-
tous in the aggregate and which we have some
immediate prospect of getting. Dangle the
carrots occasionally, but let the ass get a few
substantial thistles meantime. — Treble B.
The Disastrous Land-Tax.
The Australian Star publishes a lank and
foolish article whose burden is that in Maori-
land the cultivated area is diminishing, the
State revenue is declining, the population is
growing less, and the yield of agricultural pro-
duce is falling off, and that all these evils arise
through the land-tax. It, therefore, beseeches
New South Wales to be warned in time and
keep clear of land-tax and land-taxers. The
alleged decline of revenue is based on one
quarter’s returns, and the loss of population
rests on the fact that (apart from the rush to
Coolgardie) in one month —the month when the
regular exodus of shearers to Australia is on—
the departures were more numerous than the
arrivals. This method of using statistics re-
quires very little intelligence. It simply con-
sists in stating that there is, in some particular
country, a law or system, or an absence of one
of them, that you object to, and also that the
same country has a period when, in some re-
spect or other, it is less prosperous than it was
at some other period. Then it is only neces-
sary to shalre the two circumstances up
together. The cause ascribed may be Free-
trade, Protection, land-tax, want of a State
Church, “ godless education,” labor legislation
—anything, in fact; and as no country is always
more prosperous in every respect this year than
it was every previous year, or this day than
it was the day before, the same argument
always fits. If the Star can show that the
population of Maorilaud and its revenue and its
cultivated area have steadily declined for a
series of years since the land-tax was imposed,
or even that they have increased at a much less
rate than they did before, and that the down-
ward movement and the land - tax began
together, then it would go a long way towards
proving its case. But the mere fact that Maori-
land is apparently a shade less prosperous in
one year under the land-tax than it was in
another year under the same system, counts for
nothing, so long as the fact remains that the
province is richer in almost every respect than
it was in the pre-lamhtax period. No political
system ever invented will make fluctuations
absolutely impossible, and nobody save a Para-
guayan emigrant expects it to. Maoriland’s
present “ disastrous ” land-tax dates from 1891.
Since then the population has increased largely,
whereas there was a heavy decrease in all the
years from ’B6 to ’9l, and the Star’s alleged
falling off is a garbled affair which is arrived at
by taking one month only and tacitly assuming
that it is a fair sample of the whole year. Its
exports have reached their highest record in the
land-tax period ; its savings bank deposits
have grown to be the largest, per head of
population, in Australasia, the land-tax pro-
vince of S.A. alone excepted ; and its total
yield of agricultural and pastoral pro-
duce, in proportion to population, is now
also the largest with the exception of
Queensland only. If the present situa-
tion of Maoriland is owing to the land-tax.
as the Star alleges, then it presents a most
powerful argument in favor of that policy.
Unfortunately the old political hacks of the
Dibbs party have taken up an attitude of hos-
tility to the land and income tax simply because
it is an axiom of the degraded science of party
politics that they should be “ agin the Govern-
ment ” in all things. The fact that the present
N.S. W. Freetrade-party alsofoughtagainst these
two measures when it was in Opposition and the
Dibbs crowd’s political hacks advocated the
land-tax from the Ministerial benches, only
aggravates the immorality of the proceeding.
And the Star, which follows every change of
its owners’ policy, grinds out its tune to order,
just as it would grind out any other tune if so
instructed.

many months before the alleged libels were
published. Nevertheless, there remains the
objectionable fact that the Age proprietor, who
has been virtually dictator of the vie. railway
policy, and who brought about the dismissal of
Speight and Allison Smith, did take a fourth
share in a certain patent truck built in
the hope that it might be adopted by
the railway officials aforesaid. Anybody is
entitled to assume that the promoters, having
faith in their patent, rushed Mr. Syme into the
spec, because they wanted the strongest possible
influence at the back of it. And everybody
must agree that the mighty critic of a railway
department invites a certain amount of suspicion
when he takes a pecuniary interest in some-
thing which the head of the department afore-
said is requested to buy. The fate of David
Syme’s truck depended upon the nod of Smith
and Speight to just about the same extent that
Smith’s arid Speight’s billets depended upon
David Syme’s nod. Fair comment.
The Maoriland Government is confronted by
the fact that it must raise money somehow to
complete the disastrous Midland railway. It
was compelled to take over the line because,
under the imbecile agreement of the Stout-
Vogel Ministry, ail the public lands in Canter-
bury, Nelson and Westland were locked up
against settlement until the Midland Co. had
selected its giants out of them, and the grants
couldn’t be selected till the line was completed,
and the co. flatly refused even to make a pre-
tence of going on with it. The want of land
for settlement drove the Ministry into shutting
down on the co., and, having done so,
the white elephant must be finished, if
only to give it a chance of earning a
part of its keep. Now the proposal to
go on with the work has aroused a wild demand
for the completion of the long-neglected Otago
Central and North Island Trunk lines, and the
present signs are that Maoriland will ultimately
proceed to execute all the three, and the bor-
rowing policy will recommence in earnest.
The ghost of Vogel is abroad, and the
speculations that he left behind him keep his
memory green. And now, if the province
starts on another career of railway expansion,
it has to consider whether it can raise the
money by more taxation, or by the issue
of a State paper currency, or by local bor-
rowing, or by tbe old policy of applying
to the disastrous British capitalist. Probably
it could be done by a combination of the first
three devices, if Treasurer Ward is the financial
genius which he imagines himself to be. Bub
though Australasia has had many financial
geniuses they were, unluckily, all of one pat-
tern ; and Ward, it is to be feared, is of one
pattern also. For a Treasurer who will dis-
pense with foreign capital and who can make
something out of nothing locally, Maoriland
now offers about the finest opening on record.
There is no credit to be gained by finding
money when it can be got by paying interest
on it; the only kind of Treasurer who is of any
use in Australasia nowadays is the one who
can find money when it can’t be gob and get it
without interest.
From among the confusion of politics The
Bulletin’s dear old friend, “ Wiugen ” Abbott,
rises up once more to complain about State-
railway ownership. Says Abbott :
If the State had never made a mile of railway in New
South Wales private enterprise would before now have
supplied railways, where they were really required, with
freight charges at about half what they are now on our
State railways, so that producers would only have been
taxed to half the amount of the present freight tax.
Second, that New South Wales, in proportion to popula-
tion, has already more railways than America or any
other country, and more than the present population can
profitably use. And, third, that every railway system in
Australasia would have been insolvent and in the hands
of receivers 20 years ago if it were not for the system of
making up losses out of the general revenue of the
country, thus doubly taxing producers, and then concoct-
ing a balance-sheet which does not show in the capital
account of the railways the sums abstracted from general
revenue.
New South Wales, as it happens, has less rail-
way, in proportion to population, than Canada,
the United States, Victoria, Queensland, South
Australia, Westralia, Tasmania or Maoriland,
but Abbott can’t be, expected to know a little
thing like that. Poor Abbott, who seems to
have a personal grievance against the railways,
will probably go on in this dreadful fashion for
the rest of his life, and then he will take his
grievance away with him, and explain all about
the exorbitant freight charges of New South
Wales to the Watcher at the Golden Gate.
The man from Wingen’s burning mountain
couldn’t rest even in Paradise unless he had a
chance to read over these freight charges every
now and then to the archangels, and convince
them of the evils of State ownership. Mean-
while he never gets any further forward. Even
supposing he could prove that, if the railways
had been originally built by private enterprise,
they would have carried his goods for nothing,
he can’t get away from the fact that they
weren’t built that way, and as they can’t be built
that way now Abbott might as well write to
prove that, if George 111. had been born with
three legs, he would have had one leg more
than usual, or that, if he had never been born
at all, then he wouldn’t have existed. The
Bulletin now invites Mr. Abbott to write a
series of letters on the fact that, if there was no
such place as Australia, then we would most
likely all be somewhere else at the present
moment. The attention of the public has never
been properly drawn to this matter so far, and
a great many people have never even thought
of it.
This picture and that ! In the N.S.W. Dean
case (alleged attempt to murder) the Judge
re-called the jurymen (at 8.35 p.m. on Saturday
night) after they had been eight hours consider-
ing their verdict, and told them that if they
didn’t agree he would lock them up till Monday
piorning. That jury agreed in seven minutes.
In the Maoriland Dean case (baby-murder),
after witnesses and counsel had been heard, the
Judge told the jury, at the close of a Thursday
afternoon, that “he would defer his summing-
up till next morning, as he considered they had
had a sufficiently trying day.” Which attitude
is the fairer to a body of men entrusted with a
human life ? which the fairer to the prisoner ?
which the better for the attainment of justice ?

The Bulletin’s opinion that little Fred Kaye, as
the aggressive and towzled call-boy, is unduly
eclipsed by the vast preponderance of Brad-
field, gains ground. The call-boy is a raucous,
cheeky brat with a great fund of hoarse
humor, and he is one of the few comedians
who is humorous when viewed from behind. In
fact the call-boy is even more humorous from be-
hind than he is in front, and the back aspect of
his pants is one of G. R. Sims’s ballads epitomised.
Also, he is remotely suggestive of Lawson’s poem
about how a man feels when his pants begin to go,
assuming that his pants go, not pathetically, but
in a rakish spirit of fog and gin. Kaye looks like
the one solid fact in a play that is otherwise
mostly gossamer and song and high kick, and this
paper waits anxiously to see him in a character
which will give him wider scope. And when it
does it will probably be disappointed. The Gaiety
kind of mummer is generally disappointing when
he gets too much scope and begins to have a mort-
gage on the centre of the stage.

The Dacres are filling in their last week at
Her Majesty’s with “Man and Woman ” —a good
drama, which has been partially spoiled by the
authors’ anxiety to make it hold more characters
than there is standing-room for. They have
crowded it to such an extent that it is suggestive
of the Black Hole of Calcutta, and, in the effort
to make the dialogue go round all these people, no
single person has got enough to make him effec-
tive. Even Dacre, as the fraudulent cashier,
though he is allowed to weep considerably in the
middle of the stage, is a good deal obscured by
this rush of characters to the head, and Miss Amy
Roselle puts a vast amount of pathos an 1 ability
into a rather abbreviated part. There is not
much in “ Man and Woman,” save that the bank’s
trusted officer annexes the money for speculative
purposes, and loses it, and is then forgiven and
sacked by a fatuous-looking board, with a retreat-
ing chin. The fun is labored and disconnected,
and some of the sentimental passages are pain-
fully stupid. The Dacres do their best with the
materials on hand, and Messrs. Plimmer, Har-
court, Sweeney, and Inglis loom up, here and
there, to a considerable extent. Also, Miss Kate
Bishop makes a pleasant and pathetic mother to
the devastated cashier. The Bulletin, however,
feels an utter want of enthusiasm about “Man
and Woman,” which is built on the strictly con-
ventional theory that the man who speculates with
stolen money always loses it, and then, after a
period of adversity and repentance, during which
his girl sticks by him nobly, some grand old mer-
chant elevates him to a position of trust, and he
is last seen counting his benefactor’s cash with a
halo round his head and two wings sticking out
of his back. And, in these matters, this paper
suppresses its emotion with difficulty, and merely
remarks that Mr. Rignold will appear on Satur-
day as Frank Darlington, in that gorgeous spec-
tacle, “Youth.”

Hamilton’s Circus may be comprehensively
summed upas a show that is very like every other
circus, and contains everything which a well-
ordered circus could be expected to have. Almost
any kind of a circus can do a good business in this
horsey land, and as Hamilton’s is not any kind of
a circus by a very long way, it is doing a business
that is much above the average.

Sydney Empire has got three astonishing
bicyclists on its programme who do hair-raising
feats on the giddy wheel, and Abosalah, the
juggler, does sundry performances with a gun
which leave the Abrahams family absolutely
nowhere, despite the fact that the gun perfor-
mances of these fainting brethren were sufficiently
r emarkable. Rickards’ Co. at the Tivoli has been
further strengthened by the engagement of that
pleasing actress and vocalist, Miss Florence
Esdaile. The Tivoli 00., however, is always
being strengthened more or less.

“ Thoroughbred,” the new farcical comedy
at Melbourne Princess’, was intended to amuse
the patrons of Toole’s Theatre, London, “ where
it is now being played with immense success.”
Two distinct sets of Hinglish characters and one
casual Amurrikan gentleman provide the human
interest in “Thoroughbred,” whilst a race-horse
named Roast Chicken constitutes the plot. Roast
Chicken, although much talked about, doesn’t
appear during the evening, therefore the plot isn’t
visible. The members of the B. and B. com-
pany take their places on a drag, situated some-
where among the wilds of Ascot Heath, and cry
aloud that Roast Chicken is winning in a canter,
but if the noble animal were beaten cleverly by
three-quarters of a mile the effect on the audience
would be much about the same. A strange sense
of inane improbability is diffused by “Thorough-
bred ”in the first two acts. This alleged racing-
scene ot the last act appears hopelessly mad.
* * •
An opulent provincial mayor and his wife
Maria are the leading characters. They are sup-
ported by a daughter who speaks more correctly
than her parents, and a welsher of unknown ante-
cedents. A bankrupt lord, with a son and
daughter and a few other people of superior
manners in tow, fastens on to the mayor’s family.
The stray Amurrikan wanders round after the
lord’s daughter. The lord’s son borrows a blank
cheque from the mayor and buys Roast Chicken,
after which they all go to a villa residence at
Ascot. The wretched civic dignitary finds a
feeble excuse to flee from the police, accom-
panied by the welsher and the lord’s son.
The three fugitives disguise themselves, for
no conceivable reason, as Christy Minstrels,
and go through a certain form of being
funny because their faces are blacked. Here
endeth the third lesson, or act. “Thorough-
bred ” may have been written for the purpose of
introducing an impossible trinity in a state of
burnt cork. Thefperformance is not one of B. and
B.’s greatest achievements. Elton starts to play
the mayor as though he were impersonating a real
individual, instead of a ridiculous joke, and Miss
Jenny Watt Tanner, the awful Maria, is not at
home in low comedy parts; neither does Titheradge
Come reasonably near to an American. Boucicault,
Miss Faber, Miss Noble, arid Dorrington (in a
very minor position) are furnished with characters
that give them a chance to seem natural, more or
less, and Mr. Compton has a character which he is
peculiarly unfitted to adorn.

“A Million of Money” is a fine massive
success at Melb. Royal. The start for the Epsom
Derby is now, for the first time on any stage, a
machine-made spectacle, and White Stocking has
improved a good 141 b. in appearance since the
first night. Also, the victory of the favorite
excites wilder enthusiasm than ever, yet there is
still one thing wanting to complete the moral
lesson of Bland Holt’s Derby. He has for-
gotten to interpolate a “tote” into which
the multitude might pour their sovereigns
with the knowledge that they were getting fair
odds, less 8 per cent. A subsequent tableau,
moonlight on the downs, might show a heap of
bookmakers lying dead upon the course, with
revolvers clutched in their right hands and despair
written on their rigid countenances. These would
show the tote’s value as a turf-purifier, and the
Vic. Leg. Council would pass the forthcoming bill
by an overwhelming majority. “ A Million of
Money ” is certain to run another week or two, so
there will be time to adopt this suggestion.

Harry Rickards is again illuminating the
Opera House bill, but only for five nights. On
Monday next that invincible mezzo - baritone
vocalist and vigorous delineator of coster character
will tune his last lay prior to catching the steamer
for London. This occasion will probably be
marked by the finest gallery chorus on record.
The Gerards, Tudor and Friedman, and the rest
of the co. are for the time being suffering an
eclipse. Rev. Haskett Smith gathers in the silver
of the godly at the Athenaeum Hall, and the Town
Hall will be enlivened until Saturday by dissolving
views, Pepper’s ghosts, concerts, and many other
items, including light refreshments, in aid of the
Tucker Village Settlements.

Titheradge’s break-down at Melb. Prin-
cess’s, the other night, was a serious business for a
few minutes. Dr. Adams, who hurried down to
the stage from the circle as soon as he saw the cur-
tains drop, found Tith. in an icy perspiration
clinging to Boucicault for support. His heart had
struck work, and it was not until the doctor
straightened him out that Tith. ’s vital organ began
to make healthful music again. An abscess at the
root of a tooth originated this little drama.
Titheradge, a very nervous man, required
chloroforming by Dr. Neild before being
operated upon by dentist Oldfield; and the
combined effects of chloroform and abscess
knocked him out. There hadn’t been a long
enough lapse of time between Tith.’s afternoon
and evening performances. He was still cold and
tottery when he went on for the first act of
“Sowing the Wind,” and by about 8.30 he felt so
disposed to die that Australia nearly lost its old
favorite. This was Tith.’s first experience of his
heart suspending operations—a terrible shock for
a novice. One can get hardened to heart-stop-
pages, however, just as one can cultivate indiffer-
ence to bank failures.

The Bishop of Melbourne took the chair
at Rev. Haskett Smith’s first lecture in Mel-
bourne, but he didn’t take it much. Having
introduced Rev. Smith in a small assortment of
well-chosen remarks, be sat in an armchair until
the lights were put out, a period of about four
minutes. As soon as darkness fell upon the audi-
ence Field Flowers Gqe fled. The head and
shoulders of him were visible against the magic-
lantern focus on the sheet as he moved noiselessly
across the platform, like a bishop escaping from
the wrath to come. Then he was gone. He had
prudently remembered an appointment elsewhere,
and crept away to keep it.
LYRICS OF THE STAGE-THE VILLAIN’S
ARREST.
Many scores of sensational dramas
We have taken to heart in our time :
We have wept when the sturdy young farmers
Got “ pinched ” for another man’s crime,
And rejoiced at the evidence hollow
By which all their wrongs were redressed j
But the one bit we never could swallow
Was the villain’s off-handed arrest.
The plots ot those dramas may vary,
Though virtue must triumph at last—
Some heroes are simple and hairy,
And some are clean-shaven and “ fast ”;
Then, the girl, who too blindly has trusted
The forger of grandfather’s will—
She sometimes gets mad and disgusted.
And sometimes she clings to him still.
And the murderers’ methods may differ,
As much as the victims they slay—
Some corpses, we notice, seem stiffer
Than others that fall by the way.
E’en the climax the author arranges
Is often in novelties dressed ;
But a fashion which time never changes
Is the villain’s off-handed arrest.
The police do not ask for a warrant;
They capture his nibs on the word
Of a stranger, who pours out a torrent
Of “ proofs ” primd-facie absurd.
Then he says : “The game’s up! I’m checkmated >’
His chin slowly falls on his chest;
And the gallery-boys are elated
At the villain’s off-handed arrest.
We like to find heroes asserting
Their virtue and truth on the stage ;
We like them to bring down the eurting
On baffled iniquity’s rage ;
But, in language severe and emphatic,
This journal will ever protest
Its contempt for the fiction dramatic
Of the villain’s off-handed arrest.
At Poverty Point.
Some of the Musgro've family say it is probable that
Nellie Stewart will take a theatre in the States, if she
does not have particular luck in London. She has an
ambition to conquer America.
Dear Bulletin,— He the late Vi Varley’s secession from
the Opera Co. “Ah Pooh” misses the point. The little
woman never questioned the riaht of the Firm to cast
Marton as they pleased—that would have been manifestly
absurd. What she did feel sore about was that, after
eight years’ continuous service—in which she had proved
herself a valuable artiste—they should treat her with Such
a want of courtesy.—Ah Gib.
Fitzgerald Bros’, menagerie and circus is wintering on a
farm at Papatoetoe, near Auckland (M.L.), in charge of
the long-haired Capt. Sutton. There are nearly 70 horses
and ponies devastating the surrounding country, while
the lions, tigers, panthers, &0., may be heard roaring for
food several miles away. J. Burns, the lion, is now a
husband and a father, but the first litter of cubs were
eaten by their loving ma. Two beautiful tiger cubs are
growing up and are in training. Several litters of lion
and tiger cubs are expected before the return of Daniel
and Tomaso from London.
Walter Bentley is lecturing in his broadest Scotch
accent at Brisbane. When all else fails, the Scot and the
Irishman have a good card left in nationality-. The Eng-
lishman badly wants a brogue, too. Come to think of it,
he has one, but somehow it doesn’t take with the public.
“ When the Liliputians were playing in Kentucky, one
of the men in the company vastly pleased a lovely Mays-
ville girl. He stopped at the hotel where she was visit-
ing, and when she met him in the hall after the
she stepped up to him, patted him on the cheek, and then
imprinted one of those kisses that only a Kentucky girl
can dispense. ‘You dear, ’cute little thing!’ she ex-
claimed, as she lifted him for another smack, ‘how old
are you T ‘ Twenty-nine,’ he replied ;‘do it again.’ ”
Thus the London correspondent of the S.A, Advertiser,
writing on May 17 :—‘‘Mr. Mandeno Jackson, Who is
wonderfully well up in Anglo-Colonial musical gossip, and
most kind in letting us know items of interest, tells me
that Sims Reeves has signed and sealed for a tour of the
colonies i,his autumn. He is to receive 100 guineas a per-
formance. Mr. Jackson speaks of the great tenor with
bated breath, but, being a Philistine, I will say at once
that, whatever he may have been 30 years ago, Sims
Reeves is only a grand old wreck now, and I wouldn’t
(from a musical point of view) walk across the road to hear
him. Many colonists will, however, doubtless be glad to
have an opportunity of seeing the singer whose name has,
for half a century, been a household word all over the
world, and be pleased to welcome him to Australia and
Maoriland. But don’t expect Mr. Sims Reeves to sing.
He opens his mouth and articulates in a manner which, I
believe, is a liberal education to the musical tyro, but the
top notes that erstwhile witched the world have gone
never to return.”
Newton Griffiths, a remorseless tragedian who used to
lecture on Deeming and his victims at the Waxworks,
was performing “ Drink ” at the Exhibition Hall, Fitzroy
(Melb.) last week. The playbill concluded with " a beauti-
ful story of a Noble Youth ” who visited a famous states-
man in Washington and was pressed by the f.s. and his
fascinating wife to take one glass of wine. He refused.
The playbill narrative explains the picture of moral
grandeur. “No!” replied the heroic youth resolutely,
gently repelling the proffered glass. “No!” said the
noble youth, his voice trembling a little and his cheeks
flushed, “ I never drink !” (here he grew firmer) “I saw
Newton Griffiths last night in ‘Drink,’ and that wag a
settler! ” The Bulletin is inclined to believe this story.
Some people can’t eat for 48 hours after seeing Newton
Griffiths in anything.
The Gaiety girls will probably look in at Melb. Princess’s

At Ballarat once, a circus had just ended its first part
when the police seized all the performers, except the
clown, and took them to the lock-up for being illegally on
the ground. The clown escaped under the canvas, went
into the ring, and kept the audience amused till the per-
formers began to turn up as they were bailed out.
The climax to the pomp of a recent theatrical death-
festival is furnished bv the afflicted husband in the
circular letters he hjxs sent round to sympathisers. The
effusion is graced by deceased’s photo, headed, “Sleep,
gentle violet.” And then comes this: “ The beauty of the
perfect blossom had-just been indicated by the loveliness
of the tender bud, never, alas ! to blossom here, but in a
happier world.” The dead deserve sympathy.
The cold, proud footman who writes “ Vanity Fair ” for

Pretty Ethel Haydon was much upset at the outset,of
her London engagement by the strict rule re the non-
admission of relatives or friends of artists in the dressing-
rooms or behind the scenes. Up till then she rarely
stirred out without her mother, who also acted as her
dresser. Now Mrs. Haydon has to leave her daughter at
the stage-door before the performance, and cannot go
near her till it is over.
Maggie Moore thinks seriously of a N.S.W. provincial
tour with “Struck Oil,” “The Golden Giant,” and Irish

Marshall Hail’s last musical composition was a failure.
It professed to be a dramatic scene, based upon a
passage from Tennyson’s “ Maud.” It was unmelodiqus,
dull, wearisome, and, in fact, an outrageously unmusical
assault upon a fine poem. It made one think of Gautier,
who printed on one of his books the notification : “Com-
posers are warned not to string notes to these verses.”
In a private letter, Mrs. Brown-Potter tells of her

Emile Girard is in Melb. again, appearing at the Opera
House with the comely wife whom he married in Hobart
six years ago, and afterwards took to Paris to acquire
French pantomime polish. Veteran Emile is the same
slim, easy master of his business as ever. He laughs,
and with reason, at the medical doctrine that a man’s
limbs lose their elasticity after the age of 35, and says
that a properly-trained knock-about artist, who makes no
flesh in his middle age, can preserve his stage youth for
three-score years and ten.
A reoentjoriticism of Melba says: “ Her voice is now in
its prime, and, although still rather cold in style, she also
has, to a certain extent, developed her powers as an
actress.”
The Honorable Dudley Churchill Majoribanks was sum-
moned back from Winnipeg (Canada) to London, the
other week, to consider a breaoh-of-promise suit brought
against him by Birdie Sutherland, of the Gaiety Theatre.
Birdie, whose family name happens to be Watkins, is
described as one of a beautiful cluster of daughters born
of “ extremely good-looking " bourgeois parents. The
Hon. D.O.M. is presumably a johnnie of the ordinary
pattern.
Irving legally changed his name when his son went to
Eton, because a false name could not be used there.
Pro.: “Elton’s joining the B. and B. co. is a capital
thing for both sides. The want of bite lately has been, to
a degree, through the lack of a powerful eccentric come
dian to replace Brough, and the public gets jaded on the
drawing-room pieces.”
Arthur Sullivan is said to be patching up his quarrel
with W. S. Gilbert, and another comic opera collaboration
may result. Sullivan, who gets a taste for gambling from
the Hebrevy blood, and likes to be “in with the swells,”
has taken to the turf as a horse-owner, and has dropped his
jingling guineas thus far. The other day he had two
horses going for a race, sold one of them privately to
Blundell Maple and declared to win with the other.
Whereupon the discarded animal came in first, whilst the
esteemed stable companion finished second. Sullivan re-
tired to the saddling-paddock and composed a dirge.
The card-cutting episode in “The Masqueraders” is
rather suggestive of the gambling scene in Boucicault’s
“Led Astray.” There the husband requests his wife’s
lover to play a bogus game of cards with him, in order
that he may accuse the Lothario of cheating, fling the
cards in his face, and so provide an excuse for a duel
without dragging the lady’s name into the quarrel. The
late Charles Thorne, an American actor, made a great hit
in Boucioault’s scene, which, by the wav, was taken
from a French original. Thorne was the infuriated hus-
band, speaking in deadly whispers.

The most prosaic thing in this world is a policeman. In
England, a little while ago, a professional diver gained a
big advt. by jumping from the roof of a railway-carriage
as if crossed a bridge, and doing a dive of 150 ft. or so into
the river beneath. And when he got out of the water
amid tremendous applause, an absolutely unmoved con-
stable ran him in for “ leaving a carriage while it was in
motion.”
Ellen Terry may not appear again.
Tom and Dan Fitzgerald have arrived in London
through the States. On the voyage over they had for
fellow travellers the Prince of Batfenberg and suite and
Qeorge’H. Wood, the somewhat diffident comedian. The

he imitated the “Battenberg and suite” accent and
manner to such perfection as to make the house yell.

Mdlle. Liane de Pougy, of the Folies
Eergeres, who is just now the vogue in Paris,
writes a Bulletin correspondent, wears more
jewels than perhaps any woman living. In
default of having any other place to show them
she has rows of splendid solitaire diamonds stitched
down the seams of her dress. She usually wears
a girdle of emeralds and diamonds, the centre
stone being as large as a five-franc piece. Recently
one of the jeunesse doree who wished to be asked
to one of her petits soupers paid for that privilege
a diamond necklet which cost him .£5OOO. At
Monte Carlo she had some words with another
swaggering and bejewelled lady of her class.
Next evening she came into dinner with the most
magnificent jewels all over her, and accompanied
by her maid, almost as bedizened as herself. She
flaunted past her rival triumphantly saying,
“ What do you think of this ? il y en a encore assez
pour trois femmes de chambre. Pah !” When at
Mentone la belle Pougy keeps two gens d’armes
outside her villa to guard her valuables. Her
virtue takes care of itself.

The land around Fremantle (W.A.) is
mostly held by a few old fossils, who flatly refuse
to sell for building purposes, or to build them-
selves, or to lease their land, or to do anything
save vegetate. Consequently, the progress of
Fremantle is practically stopped short; there is
not a house obtainable, and a large number of
people are living in tents outside the town. There
is no visible reason why the fossils in question
should refuse to sell, save their old, crusted
Westralian conservatism on which even a liberal
cash offer fails to make any impression, or else
their belief that the present boom is going to last
for ever, and that prices will rise steadily for
years to come. Meanwhile, the “young ini-
quities ” from the East are beginning to think of
building a new town somewhere else and leaving
Fremantle stranded. The immoveable W.A.
fossil is the province’s worst drawback.
A sample of cotton blankets, made in Ger-
many, and invoiced at 3s. 3d., was shown to the
Vic. Assembly last week by Zox, M.L.A. The
Turner Govt, had adopted the Tariff Board’s
suggestion of al5 per cent, duty on this ghastly
device for warming the poor man’s shoulders, and
it was J. B. Patterson, the freetrader’s friend,
who carried a resolution in favor of 25 per cent.
On Alfred Deakin’s motion, the House decided to
admit cotton blankets duty free when their true
character is branded on their imitation-woollen
faces. This may possibly improve matters.
The unfortunates led by poverty to pur-
chase the German stuff will get it at a low
price, and know it for what it is, and if the local
mills cannot soon tempt them to pay more for a
cheap woollen article, Lord help Victoria. But
until the Vic. mills are able to brand “all wool”
upon their flannelsthey will win norespect for their
blankets. When they have
manufactured a first-class
reputation for something they
will be in a position to talk
to the public.
The wife of N.S.W.
ex-Premier Parkes died on
16th inst. (since the para-
graph in another part of
this issue was printed). She
was aged only 38, and leaves
a still-young family. Some-
one has said that half
most politicians’ successes
are won by the social
influence of their wives.
The ex - Premier’s wife
gained no votes for her
husband, for “society”
cold - shouldered her
from the gilded circle to
to which she never willingly
aspired, and to which her
homely constant
rebuke. But the deceased
lady would have immea-
surably atoned for this, had
atonement been necessary,
by the rare and deep per-
sonal devotion which im-
pelled her, almost with her
dying breath, to urge her
husband to “No Surrender!”
in the election-contest which
he is now waging. The
veteran politician, now
past his 80th year and
twice a widower, has re-
ceived many splendid
testimonials, but none so
noble as the utter trust of
his dead wife in his talents
and his character. His
chequered life has been full
of pathetic phases, but it
has held none more touching
than that in which the bitter
enmity of the electioneering
arena was hushed into re-
spectful sympathy across
the open grave of the woman
who loved him.
Premier Reid’s proposition to reduce
Sydney pilotage-rates “means well, but doesn’t
know.” Port Jackson is unique in the matter of
exemptions, which can be obtained for .£5 by any
foreigner after a couple of visits to the port. This
is Freetrade witli a vengeance. The big French
boats enter Port Jackson free of pilotage, bub
when the little Australian-owned Birksgate paid
Noumea a visit, not long since, the owners had to
pay £49 pilotage. Mr. Reid proposed to reduce
the pilotage one-half, and said that, as regards
exemptions, the men had paid their money and
the Government could not go back on its con-
tract. But here he was wrong. The exorbitant
charges should certainly be reduced one-half, but
there would be no breaking of contract in
compelling all foreign-going ships to pay a
reasonable figure. The exemption is given
a man to enable him to bring his ship
in or out of the harbor without a pilot, but,
as regards the fees, they should be paid
whether a ship takes a pilot aboard or not. If a
master holds an exemption and likes to handle his
own ship, well and good; but that ship should
pay fair dues as in every other port of the
civilised world. Should the exempt ones take
exception to the payment of “ pilotage ” where no
pilot is used, then call the fees something else.
They would smell just as sweet in the Treasury
under any other name. The Govt, loses fully
£lO,OOO per annum on the four big companies
alone. Then, again, though the Government em-
ploys a staff of Harbor pilots, the Marine Board
allows vessels to pay a pound or so to a tug-
boat to move them about the Harbor—with no
pilot and no dues—though such action, in
any other port of the world, would draw a stiff
fine. The revenue derivable from Our Beautiful
Harbor under fair laws, properly administered, is
more worthy of consideration than Premier Reid
is aware of.
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties haye been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.
Some N.S.W. Election Notes .
The Sydney Foreign-trade party is now
striving to stump N.S.W. on an imported wooden
leg.
The latest Sydney scandal : A veteran
politician has eloped with “Dr. MacLaurin’s
Widow.”
“The twin causes of Freetrade and
Federation.” The twin curses of Freetrade and
Free Labor.
Hurley should be decisively rejected for
West Macquarie in favor of Crick, a fearless and
able critic indispensable to the Assembly.
“ Where is the N.S.W. Single-tax party?”
Piping voice from the depths of Premier Reid’s
bingey : “We have swallowed and are digesting
it.”
Minister Young has got a bad shaking
through the proposed repeal of the sugar-duties;
it is ominous that Attorney-General Want has
gone to his assistance.
Let the N.S.W. Leg. Council disease
stand for arsenical poisoning. Reid offers to
cure it with a mixture largely consisting of strych-
nine—which is Foreign-trade.
Times change. Here is the “great N.S.W.
Freetrade-party ” supporting the Republican
Arthur Rae, for the Murrumbidgee. It is not
Rae who has altered, but his enemies !
Shipway, of the legion of commonplace
legislative attorneys, should be easily thrust out
of Paddington by Jawbone Neild —a man who has
at his credit a long list of useful reforms.
“ The fashionable friends of Freetrade.”
But how about the fashionable friends of Labor ?
Just think of it —M‘Millan the ally of Sleath
and barrister Reid the friend of Arthur Rae !
Parkes; “ Why, the very water you drink is
supplied to you under my act of Parliament.”
The Late LADY PARKES.
Even the Deity, if addressing the electors, could
go but one step further. Not that a modest Deity
would.
Dr. James Graham, N.S.W. Freetrade
candidate : “ The collective capacity of the Upper
House is, I admit, greater than the collective
capacity of the Lower House.” True, its rent-
collective capacity !
The Bulletin would be sorry to see Dibbs
beaten at Tamworth by that dryasdust Foreign-
trader, Turkey Piddington, Junr. The Assembly
couldn’t stand two Piddingtons any more than
it could stand two Cullens.
A horrible electioneering announcement
from Pambula : “Major Samuel David Thomas
Augustus Mordina Woods (P.), of Boydtown,
Twofold Bay, has again announced himself as a
candidate for Eden-Bombala.”
The question of the N.S.W. election :
Which party is “working for the mortgagee”—
the Freetrade-party or the Labor-party ? Is Free-
trade going to swallow up Labor, or will Labor
swallow up the Freetraders ?
Premier Reid’s enemies can get little
change out of the fact that he opposed payment of
members. So did Dibbs and Parkes, and yet
Reid was for long one of the only two members
who refused to accept payment.
It is safe to say that M‘Millan (now absent
in England), who is to be returned for Burwood
with a view to his blessing Premier Reid, will, in
the long run, be found cursing him most heartily.
If the Reidites want a friend, let them throw
MMillan out.
Again The Bulletin says : Vote for no
man who is an alderman or a preacher. And
especially avoid mayors. Australian history
shows every alderman and every preacher to have
been a prosaic failure. And a mayor is an aggra-
vated alderman.
Parson Bennet-Anderson, who seeks to
enter N.S.W. Parliament, is a saintly twaddler
who should, and will, meet with the same fate as
B. Short, the righteous assurance-canvasser, who
seeks to oust (from Argyle) Rose, one of t£ie most
useful and intelligent members of N.S.W. Parlia-
ment.
Whether or not Fitzroy electors choose
M'Elhone, they must dismiss for ever as a legis-
lator that ghastlyfailure, grocer-warrior Chapman,
who should go back to his shop and cut bacon
with his sword. There should be no room in the
House either for fiery garter-merchants or for
bellicose pickle-vendors who are nothing and
deserve to be nothing but pickle-vendors.
Personally speaking, it is a pity that Regi-
nald Black, with his unique gift of making
figures attractive, should have to stand aside for
Willoughby in favor of anyone of the Cullen
order. But to publicly shake hands with the
Ass, as Mr. Black has done, is fatal to any poli-
tician.
The Bulletin hopes to see its old col-
league, Traill, the real Parliamentary author of
the N.S.W. One-man-one-vote system, returned
for Cook as against boot-importer Whiddon.
Traill’s great services in the cause of Australian
Radicalism are none the less real because they
have been done with pen instead of voice.
An alderman named Waine opposes Wise
for Flinders. Waine is a nonentity who should
be carefully biffed. His real opinions were re-
cently illustrated in his attitude on the municipal
day-labor versus contract question. As Brains,
not aldermen, are needed in Parliament, the
electors, in choosing between two Foreign-traders,
should act accordingly.
Should the ready but erratic John Norton
be returned for Waterloo, he will, as a parlia-
mentarian, be a hedgehog stuffed with dynamite.
No more aggressive and clever constitutional
authority or political manceuvrer has ever stood
on the Assembly floor; nor has the House seen
many more forcible or better-informed speakers.
Norton should be returned on his law-reform
programme.
The Australian Star last week reprinted
a glowing Protectionist anathema of “What
Freetrade has done for England,” sent to that
journal Deo. 28, several years ago, by Joseph
Cook, of Lithgow (N.S.W.). That Joseph Cook
(subsequently leader of the N.S.W. Parliamentary
Labor-party) is now Postmaster-General in Reid’s
Freetrade Government. Another curse come
home to roost.
Better far for the N.S.W. Protectionist
party to accept Freetrade at the hands of the Reid
Government, along with land and income taxes,
than to accept Protection from the puffed-up
senility of the Council, sans any direct taxation at
all. If the Foreign-trade party is to rule, let pure
and absolute Freetrade be established unto the
pinching of the workman’s stomach. The shortest
way to some men’s brains is through their
stomachs.
Queer that while ex-Treasurer See, a
strong Protectionist, represents a N.S.W. river-
constituency, Works-Minister Young, an equally-
pronounced Freetrader, should be so solid in a
neighboring electorate with precisely similar in-
terests. The explanation, of course, is that Mr.
Young is a person who, for some occult reason,
continually gets Ministerial office, and has power,
as the chief-spending Minister (Works), to provide
his voters with, to put it mildly, a fair share of
loaves and fishes.
If Mr. Walter Harcourt Palmer, who is
opposing O’Sullivan for Queanbeyan, happens to
be the Mr. Palmer who helped to promote the
Colo Valley grab, he should be thrown out with
such violence that people three blocks away will
be able, metaphorically speaking, to hear his skull
crack on the pavement. Likewise, Frank Cotton,
though one of the most brainy and useful men
who has been in the Assembly of late years,
should be summarily rejected for Newtown unless
he publicly swears off Colo,
The Broken Hill Labor-party, fearing no
opposition for the three seats locally held,
is spending all its money in the effort to dislodge
Speaker Abbott from Wentworth. The Speaker’s
opponent is one Scobie, a Menindie saddler, who
has found his way stony since he opposed “ Sir
Joseph” a year ago. Even if returned he will
not be a political star, though he will be a distinct
acquisition as knowing something about pastoral
and land questions at least—the weak point in the
party’s armor hitherto. A year ago he was beaten
by only 93 votes ; and as a canvass has been going
on all the time, in Scobie’s interest, the Speaker
is thought by many to have shown little discretion
in risking the seat again.
Henry Harris, of Harris and Ackman, has
no chance in Fitzroy. In addressing the electors he
denounced payment of members, and said (D.T.)
“if returned, his .£3OO would not.be a penny
benefit to him personally, but should be distri-
buted amongst the poor of the electorate.”
(Cheers.) Which (as the promise of the money to
charity is a benefit to him personally) was just as
indecent as the action of the barrister who, ap-
pearing for plaintiff in a libel-action, announced
that his client would hand to charity any damages
awarded him. The utmost Mr. Harris'can do is
to spoil the chance of M‘Elhone, the only Fitzroy
candidate with any political brains.
For the alleged “Catholic vote,” the only
uncertain quantity in King division, Premier
Reid made a most adroit bid when he said that
the brainy but heartless Parkes had acted with
black treachery to Edward Butler, one of the
noblest of men, who resigned the N.S.W.
Attorney-Generalship because Parkes had broken
his promise to give him the Chief Justiceship.
He (Premier Reid) was then in the (strangers’)
gallery, at the Assembly, and at once vowed (that
was long over 20 years ago ! how we do countour
chickens !) never to be a colleague of Parkes, who,
in saying that Butler “had not sufficient social
recognition to be given the Chief Justiceship,”
had revealed his true self. Yet Parkes, who had
always sneered at him (Reid), had never formed a
Ministry for the last 10 years without offering
him office.
Premier Reid’s statement that the N.S.W.
property-holders pay only about £BOO,OOO and the
wage-earners £1,900,000 per annum in taxes has
moved theS.M. Herald to a calculation, whereby
it endeavors to show that the property-holders
really pay £959,000 and the wage-earners only a
little over £1,800,000. In this calculation, it is
assumed that the propertied and professional
class drinks all the wine that is imported, that it
drinks 10 times as much imported fieer per head
as the wage-earner, that the wage-earner smokes
the same proportion of cigars as the other fellow,
that the 15 per cent, ad valorem duties—
which include such things as clocks, carpeting,
portmanteaux, chinaware and watches are
wholly paid by the propertied class, and that it
pays all the probate and stamp duties ! The
£959,000 which the Herald alleges to be paid by
the propertied class of the community isn’t much
even if it did pay it, and the particulars of the
calculation, which are recklessly supplied by Mr.
W. J. Lyne, prove that it doesn’t contribute any-
thing like that amount, and that a land-tax is
urgently wanted to make things a little more
even. The person with a bad case should avoid
details as he would a serpent.
In the proposed Bill for the reform of the
N.S.W. Marine Board, it should be provided
no member shall be a shareholder or otherwise
interested in local steamship companies ; also, that
no member shall place himself under obligations
to shipping co.’s officials by getting billets for his
fneucls.

The majestic Acting-Governoress Madden
struck a new idea for her first deputy vice-regal
ball. After the opening set of lancers she re-
turned in state to the dais and gave reception to
nine debutantes. These favored spinsters, who
didn’t form a specially beautiful crowd, shook the
royal hand in turn, and were desired to take seats
adjoining Her Majesty, whence they were pre-
sently rescued by their partners for the next hop.
After which they mingled with the rest of the
company on even terms. Lady Madden’s
opinions concerning the beautiful innocence
of maidenhood are supposed to have been
partly responsible for this trotting out of the nine
debutantes, the balance of the reason being j, a, m,
jam. In her eyes there is something holy and
reverend about the virgin who is “ coming out ”
at Guvmentouse. Providence has just called the
timid fawn to take her place in “society,’’and Lady
Madden, accommodating her young friend with a
seat on the da* is Providence’s special agent.
THE MAORI LAND NEW WOMAN.-Scene No. 1.
The occasion is not quite so solemn as a baptismal
service, but it forms a sort of semi-secular link
between confirmation and marriage. ILady M.
might rig-up a suitable catechism for debutantes
a id have them “ prepared ” for the ordeal by a
dowager of acknowledged virtue.

A daughter of an arch-boomster cropped
up among the nine debutantes presented at the
Court of St. Smellbourne the other evening. She
appeared in a somewhat costly cream satin, also
her ma figured prominently in pink satin, and
papa wore a black suit d la nolle prosequi, let in
with tinsel tentacles and watered with depositors’
tears. What is it that Fritz Rimma says of Cap-
tain Coddington, in “In Town?” “ He’s very
thick ! ” The Bulletin is disposed to say the
same thing of the boomster who was only lately
whitewashed by Acting Gov. Madden (in his
judicial capacity), in consideration of having paid
nothing in the £. “He’s very thick,” is that
boomster. There were a good many thick ’uns at
this unblushing function (and several Judges
rubbing shoulders with them), but the areh-
“ banker ” struck one as being the thickest of all.
* * *
A Melb, daily paper mentions, re the
Madden ball at Guvmentouse, that most of the
women wore black, but “the debutantes, those
studies in white, supplied the high lights.”
Which calamitous displacement of internal organs
was no doubt consequent upon tight-lacing.
* * *
Twenty-two years ago a Victorian was
convicted on a charge of felony and sent to prison
for a term. On his release he didn’t seek his
young wife, who had gone back to her parents in
the meantime, but went far afield and married
another woman by whom he had two children. In
due course the original wife, having other arrange-
ments in view, spent £lOO in obtaining a divorce,
which involved a charge of bigamy against her
former spouse. He got two years for the bigamy,
and the poor woman he had married under false
pretences died of a broken heart. Time went on.
The divorced wife didn’t capture the other fellow
as she had expected, or perhaps she changed her
mind. So she set forth to find the bigamist, who
was now a free man again in all respects, and per-
suaded him to marry her once more. They got
along well together. Their second joining in
matrimony is a complete success, and the two
children of the other woman have found an
affectionate mother in their father’s twice-wedded
wife.
Now, here’s a pointer for Sydney matrimonial-
agencies. What are the odds that Dean and Mrs.
D. couldn’t be re-united ? After George’s meet-
ing with his wife the other day, The Bulletin
(which has considerably more respect for the
hero’s heart than for his head) puts them at about
(j to 4 against. According to the yarn in the
North Shore Times about the only paper
which believes that Mrs. Dean, in the words of
an asinine correspondent, has been “ used (most
cruelly and unkindly ” —Dean went to the house
in Little Collins-street, Surry Hills, where his
wife is staying, to get his bicycle. Dean
was slightly abashed at the meeting, and stood
with downcast eyes; but his wife was calm and
unemotional as a marble woman.” Soft v. tough,
apparently. “In answer to a question, civilly put,
Mrs. Dean produced the bicycle, and gave it to
Dean. . . . Our informant was an eye-witness
of the meeting, and says: ‘ Mary is looking
lovely—the roses are coming back to her che’eks,
and she’ll be the pride of Riley-street once more.”
And this paper bets that, with the slightest en-
couragement, Dean will come philandering around
in the same old fashion, heedless of what he has
gone through. Men are built that way—poor
wretches !

One of Acting-Gov. Madden’s daughters is
the best-looking girl ever seen in the vice-regal
box at Flemiugton during the last dozen years,
anyway. Also, the other daughter deserves favor-
able mention, and Mrs. Madden possesses features
of interest, whilst papa, the Judge, has a beautiful
skin and fine serio-comic appearance. Altogether,
the Madden family is a pictorial success, which
the Brassey crowd will certainly not eclipse, and,
for the sake of the pretty Miss M. aforesaid, The
Bulletin would prefer to leave vice-regal arrange-
ments in Victoria undisturbed.

“A Constant Reader” of The Bulletin
artfully, and in the guise of disinterestedness,
explains how Mr. Lees, Sydney’s Sunday-school-
superintendent-Mayor, came to give a wine-party
to the Gaiety girls :
The respected Mayor, who cannot from religious
scruples countenance public balls, seems to have, nolens
volens, attained some notoriety through the presence in
our midst of these charming creatures, the Geegees. It
is rather hard that, as a good Wesleyan, he should be
thought to have even dreamt of entertaining them. But
that greatness was thrust on him, for the true tale goes
thusly. The Geegees, on sight-seeing bent, invaded the
Town Hall, there to And the Mayor entertaining sundry
gentlemen per medium of wine and cake. Could even the
least gallant of men do other than ask such beauteous
visions to share the mayoral hospitality? It goes without
saying that the Mayor’s party helped to entertain them
with all the goodwill in the world.
Perhaps this correspondent will now oblige by ex-
plaining why Mayor Lees declined to preside at
the big Town Hall meeting to advocate the
appointment of a commission of enquiry into the
Dean alleged poisoning case.

A North Sydney divorce-case now on
the tapis will, if it eventuates, be one of the
most sensational suits ever heard in Australasia.
There are a few people who could, in several tries,
guess the name of one of the parties to the pro-
spective suit. But, so far, there aren’t many who
would dare to guess the name of the third party
out loud. From that case may come the solution
of a mystery.

Several Adelaide High Church clergymen
are already preparing for the coming of Evangeli-
cal Brewer Buxton by gradually lessening the
number of candles on their altars and otherwise
limiting the evidences of their Ritualism.
The Melbourne undertakers’ journal, the
Light, is not unworthy of a humorous profession.
Its telephone directory suggests the fatal character
of the little publication by furnishing the names
and numbers of about 150 doctors who may be
rung up. Then there is the advt. of a French
lady who supplies accomplished corpse care-takers
during the interval between death and interment,
and says—“ Rough—even if kindly—hands should
not be allowed to desecrate the remains of your
loved ones.” Finally, the advt. of Blank and
Sons, high-class undertakers, advises every pru-
dent citizen to order a heavy polished oak casket
while able. These desirable freehold residences
oan be purchased for £5 each, and the appeal of
Blank and Sons is irresistible. If you have one
ready to hand when required you are popped into
it, whereas if you die without having taken
thought for the morrow, “your executors will
perhaps consider the firm’s excellent 30s. coffin
good enough.” This warning, by the way, applies
to other post-mortem matters. If you don’t make
certain of a £lO tombstone, your executors may
be tempted to order a small cross at half the
money, and unless you buy your grave beforehand
you dunno where you are after your decease. The
Light is essentially a journal for anyone who
doesn’t feel well.

The latest S.A. public-service embezzler
was a cashier, long past middle-age, who was paid
under £3OO a year to handle thousands a day.
His predecessor received nearly twice the salary.

whereas heaps of texts oan be construed on the
other side, such as those which urge the advantage
of being denuded of cash. The clergy are all on
the ungospelly Thomas Binney racket—How to

One of the most amusing sights of Melb.
is the photo, of a very fat boy in the show-case of
a Swanston-street photographer. The youth,
scarcely past the quince-hunting stage, is attired
in a gorgeous military costume, all epaulets and
gold lace, and a scowl of vast dimensions illumines
his countenance as he withdraws his Brobdingnag-
nian sword, apparently with theintentionof slaying
the unoffending camera and scattering its innards
on the studio floor. The Vic. defence force is such
a comic institution that nobody outside the pro-
vince can properly appreciate its enormity. Some-

entirely due to the Labor members. He will not
spend any money, and as his friends also lack con-
fidence work is scarce. If these dreadful socialistic
doctrines were not so prevalent in Parliament the

The cost of maintaining prisoners in Pen-

something less. The Govt, might try the experi-

The Yic. authorities, in the halcyon days
of political influence, did not too curiously inquire
into a billet-hunter’s educational qualifications —
provided his Parliamentary sponsons were all
right. A retired civil-servant now living in Rich-

do you spell income ? ” The latter, looking over
the shoulder of his questioner, saw that he had
written down “incurn.” “That’s wrong,’’ ex-

so she simply waited until the train was sprinting
along at 35 miles an hour past her house, which
was close to the line a mile or two further on, and
then she opened the carriage-door and casually
stepped off. She struck the ground, and then
flew into the air upside-down and struck the
ground again, and after that she gathered herself
up and walked home in the same casual fashion,
quite uninjured, and was casually playing the
piano when her astounded mother returned.

The case of the Abrahams brothers, of
gun-fraud notoriety, is a pretty stiff warning to
defendants who may harbor the design of fainting
in Court. Two of the unhappy creatures appear
to have carried the starvation trick so far that, at
latest dates, they were suffering from brain-
paralysis. The first effect of gaol-hospital refresh-
ment upon all four black-fasters was a distinct
improvement in their condition, but brothers
Emanuel and Louis subsequently suffered a
relapse, after the manner of the unfed outcast who
is picked off a doorstep and regaled on soup at a

faints in Court will recover consciousness to find
his mouth being held ajar by the learned Judge,
whilst counsel for the prosecution loads him up

The Victorian naval force can take a hard
seat close to the door after its recent experiences
with the Hilaria. When that kerosene-laden
vessel was in full blaze, arid it was found impos-
sible to tow it away from the wharf, a party of
marine cavalry from the alleged warship Nelson
undertook the duty of sinking it. They got a
121 b. breech-loading field-piece, fixed it on a barge,
and moored the barge within 50 yards of the ship.
Then they fired six shots in succession, and either
never hit it in a vital spot or else missed it alto-
gether. Then an officer of experience in the
torpedo branch seized on the occasion with both
hands. He got alongside in a boat, and solemnly
drove a nail in the side of the vessel, and on the
nail he hung a big canister of gun-cotton. Three
ineffectual attempts were made to explode this,
and finally the torpedo-man retired, amid the ap-
plause of the spectators. Finally, the department,
roused to desperation, brought along a great
quantity of dynamite, which went off, possibly by
accident, and blew a hole in the Hilaria that an
omnibus could go through. This shows that the
Vic. naval force can hit an enemy in ten tries, if
the enemy stands quite still and doesn’t offer any
resistance, and allows the force to drive nails in
him to hang the gun-cotton on. But, unluckily,
the bloated armaments of Europe don’t allow any-
body, to drive nails in them with impunity.

The very latest variety of kleptomania is
that of a Melb. man who was lately sentenced to a
year’s gaol for an elaborate attempt to acquire .£lO
worth of ladies’ underclothing by false pretences.
In an .appeal heard before Judge Walsh, it was
set forth by a number of witnesses that accused
was a man of the highest character, and possessed
of considerable means, and that the cause of his
lamentable falling-away was simply “a strange
desire to become possessed of the articles enumer-
ated.” He was too bashful and nervous to acquire
them personally, so he ordered them by letter to
be sent to a non-existent lady at the house of a
clergyman, and made arrangements for intercept-
ing the parcel. His intentions, however, were
strictly honorable ; he proposed to secretly
forward his cheque for the amount, and
only desired the goods that he might gloat
over them in secret. In fact, as his counsel
reiterated with much eloquence, his downfall was
wholly owing to a shy and blushful desire “to
become possessed of the articles enumerated.”
The Judge was so much staggered by this view of
the case that he reduced the sentence to three
months. This opens quite a new line of defence,
and henceforth the man who bolts with your wife,
or abducts your watch with violence, or disappears
with your cash out of the bank, will also plead
that he was overcome with a sudden and violent
desire to possess the articles enumerated. Come
to think of it, that same desire to possess the
articles enumerated has caused more crime than
any other desire on record.

One of the most pathetic things about the
fiscal issue is the distressed widow who writes to
the papers, or to politicians, heartrending stories
about the way she has suffered through the
iniquitous policy which that paper or politician is
opposed to. Lately, MacLaurin, M.L.C.
(N.S.W.), had a widow who was so peculiarly
situated that the land-tax would reduce her from
comfort to something approaching penury.
Sydney D.T. replies with a widow who was
left, in 1886, with a dead husband, a baby,
a helpless orphan sister, and a dying brother,
all of whom she supported from her own
earnings. The 5 per cent, ad valorem duties were
imposed, and the widow had to pay Bs. more in one
week for the necessaries of life, altogether apart
from clothing. Considering that bread, meat,
coal, firewood, milk, butter, vegetables, fruit, and
many other necessaries were unaffected by the
duties, and allowing that the retailer charged the
said duties three times over to the consumer,
The Bulletin figures out that this widow
spent over .£6 in that week for food alone and
quite apart from clothing, boots, rent, gas, &c.
And, as she earned her own living this paper
hereby records its opinion that she was a really
hard-working widow with enormous grit and
more muscle than a horse. Bring along the next
widow.

My Dear Moorabinda—
Mr. and Mrs. Alec. Marsh’s “at home” at
their hotel, last week, was a hugely-attended
function most admirably arranged. Miss Esty
-Mrs. Marsh') wore a flower-like combination of
lilac silk and pale-green velvet, and carried a
graceful shower posy, and Mr. Marsh, with a
button-hole like a beacon, backed her up admir-
ably in the pump-handle business. Delightful
vocal music, per medium of Miss Esty, Nellie
Young, Mr, Marsh (who sings as easily in a
crowded room hung with non-acoustic draperies
and pictures as in the Town Hall), and Mr. Cun-
ningham, ’bnade the afternoon pass like a dream
in Z flat; and Hair Vollmar, with his ’cello, was
responsible for much real melody. Afternoon-tea
circulated most persistently, and the decorations
were good.
Loud applause followed every musical item, and
I couldn’t help regarding these unstinted marks
of approval on the part of “society,” which
studiously avoided the reserved-seats at the Esty-
Marsh concerts, as being a very dreadful thing.
To have maintained its former attitude with
dignity, Potts Point, when invited to hear the
artists in private, should either have bucked away
from the invitation as it bucked away from the
box-office, or else have attended Miss Esty’s re-
ception (it is expecting too much of “ Society ” to
suppose it could forego a gratis entertainment),
but remained stonily uninterested when the sing-
ing began. To see people who had remained afar
off from the pay-concerts climbing over one
another to get at the artistes and splitting their
gloves encoring when a free show turned up, was
a perfect object-lesson in the hide-bound and im-
pecunious manners and methods of the Top Ten.
And another awful tableau was the band of “ pro-
fessional musicians,” who told you they were
determined not to sing or play or scrape, if re-
quested, but who looked crestfallen when nobody
asked them to, nevertheless. And then the
scurries of amateurs who hung round the piano
absolutely dying to be pressed to oblige the com-
pany ! It must be a most uneasy thing to be
“ musical.”
The “grand non-sectarian” charity ball at
Sydney Town Hall last week had the honor (or
the other thing) of presenting the most motley
assemblage I have ever seen on the floor of
Sydney’s leading public ballroom. A “crown”
dance is always heterogeneous, but then, it is
usually held in a small room and in a chastened
spirit. When you multiply it and spread it out
over a big floor-space the effect is simply frightful—
on the same principle that the common or bed-
room whatsisname, observed with the naked
eye can’t thus compare for horror with itself
as it appears when scrutinised through a
magnifying-glass. The decorations were very
good, the supper-tables neatly furnished, but
the music a trifle incoherent. As the various
Sydney firms responded liberally, and the hall
was lent for nothing, the hop should be a good
thing for impecunious Sydney.
A feature of this ball was the crowd in the gal-
leries, which certainly got a good show for its
money—for, even if Mr. and Mrs. Dacre hadn’t
kindly, but inaudibly, performed a short comedy-
sketch on the platform, the many human and side
shows visible would have kept anybody doubled
up with mirth for a week. The ball was plain
and fancy-dress sartorially—“ non-sectarian,” as
one might say—but the dressing was so generally
remarkable that one hardly knew t’other from
which. One woman, for instance, in a black dress
out half-way down her back, with off-the-shoulder
sleeves and Bacchanalian shoulder-straps of crim-
sqp roses, evidently had no idea she was there in
character as “lady off a cigar-box.” But the
funniest group in'the room was a “bride”—
orange-blossoms, veil, white satin and all—a sort
of troubadour on two bright blue legs, and a third
man in a,brick-dust-red toga with an ordinary
hard hat painted red on his skull. Whether it
was Charlotte Corday or an idealisation of a Dan.
O’Connor postal pillar was not apparent. Some of
the fancy costumes were not so aggressive—nurses
in linen frocks—Gainsborough girls grabbing at
the chance to powder their noses in the flagrant
fancy-dress manner—and so on.
The Gaiety Girls turned up most desperately
frescoed. lam afraid the habit theseoharmershave
of “ clapping a little on occasionally,” as Codding-
ton says, is steadily undermining their reputation
for enduring lorveliness, for if beauty is merely a
matter of grease-paint inches deep and vegetable
rouge, “who is so poor that would not be a
beauty?” as Brutus almost said. Maud Hob-
son in porcelain-blue brocade (but with no
very astonishing diamond display)—perhaps she
has read and still believes in all the Botany Bay
convict stories—had evidently come straight off
the stage without waiting to wash her face. Ethel
Selwyn, in cream brocade, also bore evidence of
the same omission. The lady who loves to do the
Block with an Ophelia expression about her back-
hair and a snake in her hand, wore pink and
black and lota of purohaseable complexion ; but
Florence Lloyd and Miss Kearney, both in crow-
black gowns, were apparently guiltless of make-
up. Other professionals present were Miss Alice
Esty, m pale-blue brocade, with trimmings of fine
lace and silver passementerie, who came with Mr.
Marsh; Mrs. Dacre, in black and silver, her
willowy husband, and one or two more; but
“ Society ” pure and simple was not hugely repre-
sented at the “grand charity ball.” Acting vice-
royalty posed on the dais, with Miss Darley in
pink; but the attendance tapered away very
rapidly into “who is it?” after that. The fact
was that a lot of people had no fellowship with
this sudden dance, which almost bumped against
the date fixed upon, so long ago as May last, by
another ball-committee.
On dit that there is more than a storm in
a tea-cup in certain sectarian circles over the
action of an (also sectarian) official, who thinks
his road the shortest cut to the jasper gates, and
considers the other track a mere cul-de-sac. But
it is in the highest degree both unbecoming and
unofficial for a public man, supposedly represent-
ing the citizens as a whole, to abstain from giving
the whole weight of his patronage (whatever that
may be worth) to any charitable or benevolent
public object whatsoever. Mayor Lees’ latest is
to avoid lending the full light of his countenance
to one of the largest and best charity-balls of the
year—held to assist the Tempo refuge for unfor-
tunate women—just because the institution hap-
pens to be conducted by nuns ? I sincerely hope
that never again will Sydney be afflicted with a
civic head whose “conscience” is so vulgarly
inelastic as to prevent him from helping forward
with all his resources every truly charitable move-
ment, whether run in the name of God or of
Joss. The narrowness of the Mayor (surely the
head of the city should be no less liberal
and tolerant than the Acting - Governor and
his wife have shown themselves to be !) will, I pre-
dict, find little sympathy on the present occasion,
inasmuch as there is no Protestant, lady or gentle-
man, who fails to recognise and admire the unsel-
fishness of the works of the R.O. Sisters of Mercy.
Sydney Liedertafel’s last concert as an unre-
lieved male society (they have skirts in the recipe
after this), at Sydney Town Kail, was a regular
dying-swan song—very sweet to finish up with,
don’t you know. The society, framed in ferns,
was in excellent voice and splendid tune in the
region of the orchestra, and altogether I don’t
think I have ever heard a better-sung lied than
“ The Sowers,” in which the nuances were finely
presented ; while, for a less sentimental number,
“ The Way to Build a Boat ” was very exhilarat-
ing. The Liedertafel orchestra’s performance of a
classic adagio was also most soothing. A big
audience as bright as a scatter of beads pervaded
the hall, headed by the Acting-Governor, and a
regular scoop of a party.
Miss Edith King, Miss Evelyn, Mr. Weir and
Kowalski “assisted” the society, which is so
strong _ in itself that it scarcely needs much
bolstering-up. I don’t think the Liedertafel
should make common concerts of these little
affairs—it spoils their novelty. Miss King, who
made her debut as far as I was concerned, wore a
white dress with big white sleeves, and when she
breathed over her shoulders (a bad trick she’s got)
the effect was just like a pigeon making up its
mind to fly, but thinking better of it. However,
Miss King has such a sweet, full, dramatic mezzo-
soprano that one forgives a mannerism here and
there. Miss Evelyn, in pale-pink and green,
proved to have a sweet contralto voice, which will
be heard to greater advantage when the lady gets
into her platform stride, as it were, and when she
doesn’t lay on the vocal color quite so thickly. A
songstress who renders a simple song with a whole
tragedy of meaning in her tones is almost as
irritating as a woman weeping in a black-bordered
handkerchief over the remains of a pet poodle.
Among a parcel of new music recently sent to
me is the “Gaiety Waltz,” by E. Lon Pitt. It is
a fairly lively and well-named musical effort, but
it does not perpetuate any of the tunes in the
Gaiety Co.’s repertoire, as most people would
imagine by its title ; and it is also written in five
flats—a key which breaks up the common or gar-
den waltz-player, “The Katoomba” is quite the
latest local waltz to reach me. It is by a young
girl—Miss Maguire—who dedicates her first
printed effort to Acting-Governor Darley and his
wife —a very suitable dedication, considering that
the A.G. is the little tin-god of that lovely moun-
tain resort (advt.), The waltz is mostly written
with a pretty tune and the beat well sustained,
and there is also a certain sequence of musical
ideas and flow from start to finish that should
command success. *
I have also received a song, “Beauty’s Lul-
laby,” composed by Miss Louise Clarke, a Yic.
professor of music, and dedicated to Grace
Palotta, whose portrait is thrown in on the cover.
The song is French-English and is certainly very
plaintively strung together, the music being of the
old-fashioned school and framed to suit words
alleged to be written four hundred years or so ago.
It is altogether an oddly-attractive lullaby—the
only disturbing thing being an accent tearing in
the wrong direction over the final e in “ beaut A”
Another Melbourne melody is a song “In an Old
Wardrobe,” words from the Argus, music by
W. F. Turner. The music is quite harmless—
and, perhaps, as the whole thing is stated on the
cover to be in memory of poor, pretty Violet
Varley, a portrait of whom adorns the front page,
it is put beyond the pale of criticism. But I rather
fancy both poet and composer, if they contemplate
their work six months hence, will regret the
impulse which led them to rush into print
and wed music to mere bathetic doggerel
descriptive of poor Violet’s theatrical ward-
robe, from Patatout’s little sword to “Marten’s
folded skirt.” A new comic duet in Sydney is
“The New Woman and the New Man,” words by
Tucker, and music by Lyndon. It has been sung
with great success at the Tivoli, and is every bit
as good as the comic songs which come out
stamped with the approval of the London’alls.
Which, you may say, is a rather left-handed
compliment.
The final appearance of the Esty-Marsh co., in
connection with enterprising photographer Eden’s
popular concerts at Sydney Town Hall, attracted
thousands of people again last Saturday. The
programme was compiled to suit what is under-
stood to be the public taste, and so the most
classic event was Mr. Alec Marsh’s dramatic sing-
ing of the “Fagliacci” overture; though Miss
Esty (who wore white and silver brocade with a
lovely pair of sleeves of the latest Parisian cut,
curving in to the figure, and much more elegant
than the big, abrupt, prize-pumpkin sort of abnor-
mality we think is quite le dernier mot) gave the
Jewel Song, from “ Faust,” delightfully. But so
many amateurs have murdered this charming
seena, in the sturdy tones of a steam-whistle, that
it has got to be regarded as a sort of vocal
“ Battle of Prague ” when taken outside the opera,
and so is decidedly “popular,’ Miss Esty had
the triumph of the evening after it—flowers by
the truck-load and loud shrieks of approval from
a crowd which was only pacified by a triple
encore. Mrs. C. A. Edwards assisted the com-
pany with a very soft and tender rendering of
Behrend’s “The Gift, ” for which she was bouqueted
and encored —indeed, the encoring was dreadful,
and should certainly be checked when it turns
14 numbers into 26 !
People have no consciences—and though this
appreciation is always welcome, still, killing by
kindness is a recognised slaughter, and audiences
should take the price into consideration when they
are clamoring for more. At one shilling for 14
items you get your music at a fraction less than
one penny per number, and when you stretch it
into 26 at the same figure you are getting a musi-
cal “ blow-out ” for less than a half-penny per
plateful! All the members of the 00, suffered.
Mr. Cunningham had to give a trifle more—and
Mr. Marsh, who sang the “Toreador” song as
only he can sing it, made it the last number but
one of the programme, and wrestled with the
same clamor at even that late hour. Even Herr
Vollmar, with the unpopular ’cello, got a recall,
and altogether the Esty-Marsh Co. wound up
amidst a scene of much enthusiasm. To-night
(Saturday) Mr. Weir (tenor) and la femme incom-
jprise—Madame Enriquez—are to appear at the
musical Garden of Eden.
This month finishes like a pawnbroker, in a
festive sense, for three balls are billed in it. Tempe
ball committee has wisely altered the date of
its popular fixture in Sydney Town Hall to 30th
inst., as on the first date (24th) wild politi-
cians will have the town by the throat in a general
election. Against the attractions of a first-class
poultry-supper donated by the committee ladies,
and which I am requested to particularise, change
of date (generally rather superstitiously feared by
ball committees) has little power. By the way,
Mrs. Prendergast and Mrs. Brennan are hon.
secs. The annual Masonic ball, which assumes a
gorgeous aspect now-a-days, comes off on 31st
inst., at the Town Hall, and will take some dress-
ing for on the women’s part, for, when the lords
of creation are trimmed with silk and jewellery,
the women have a task to avoid being snuffed out.
Messrs. G. H. Marsh and F. Harvey have most of
the worry getting the A. M. ball staged. The
third dance is provoked by the East Sydney
Rowing Club—the aquatic youths one sees spurt-
ing about the harbor, apparently equipped for the
. burlesque stage, in sleeveless jerseys. Their ball
is at West’s rooms on the 19th.
Acting-Gov. Darley has begun to spend part of
the V.R. screw in society entertainments. His
first festivity after taking up residence at
Guvmentouse was a dinner to mixed politicians
and pastoralists. It doesn’t apparently require a
genius to fill the Y.R. shoes—at any rate H.E.
evidently doesn’t mean to get out of the conven-
tional groove, judging by his invitation-list. Same
old “representative” mob with no alleviating
fringe to it; seemingly “ Wellington to meet Nel-
son,” and vice-versa. Really, history is merely a
circumstance in the repetition line compared with
Australian upper-crust tea-parties. But still
these stereotyped alleged entertainments coat
money. In Lord Jersey’s latest letter to Parkes,
which the handy press-reporter was just in the
nick of time to see, he says that “ filling the posi-
tion of Governor had cost him .£7OOO per annum ”
(understood to mean over and above his salary.)
Vice-royalty, by the way, has a habit of moaning
in the distance over its receipted caterer’s bills
that ought to be decidedly embarrassing to the
former recipients of its hospitality.
Madame Henry’s last reunion musicale of the
Cerole Frangais, at her rooms, Pitt-street, near
Park-street, on Monday evening, was very plea-
santly arranged. The artistically-decorated room
was crowded with appreciative listeners, who
preferred the crisp farce of “ Le Parapluie”—with
Miss Agnes Mowle letter-perfect as a soubrette,
Miss King natural as Miss Gibson, and Mons. de
Yilleval absolutely starring as the lover—to the
more imposing “La Matinee d’une Etoile,” in
which Mrs. Lumsdaine performed the disillu-
sioned star with the air of one who longs to be
play-acting something fearsomely dramatic with
poison in it. Dr. Roth did all he could
to lighten the atmosphere with a touch-and-go
sketch of “un offloier” (his exit being the signal
for much applause), but his comedy was over-
whelmed. However, both pieces went brightly
enough. Madame Henry (who looked regal in a
black velvet bodice striped with gold lines over a
black silk skirt trimmed with jet), besides teach-
ing a very charming accent to her cercle, chooses
piquant little plays for them which one hears
nowhere else.
It seems that Sydney has not seen the last of
the popular Esty-Marsh concert co., now trying
its luck again in Melbourne. Mr. J. E. Sykes,
the genial and well-known Sydney musician,
has arranged for a series of seven operatic
recitals in the Centenary Hall, beginning on
Saturday, August 3rd. Three old favorites and
two operas new to Australia—" Gabrielle ” and
“ Ivanhoe”—will be exploited in excerpt form,
and subscription tickets for the course (and trans-
ferable) will be half-a-guinea—a low fee for hear-
ing these distinguished artistes in the very best
portions of their repertoire. And, talking of high-
class music, Clifford Halle and Miss Ribbentrop
are billed to open at the Y.M.O.A. Hall to-night
(Thursday).
The last piece of Sydney hospitality offered to
the Gaiety Co. en masse was a midnight trip to
Sydney Observatory to count the twinkle-twinkles
through the big telescope. Stars looking at stars
and winking at one another ! Venus counting
the spots on Venus with the unfair advantage of a
strong spy-glass ! What an apt festivity !
Another cockatoo-story. An Australian matron
possesses a bird which she has trained to call out
“ mother !” in the most realistic manner possible,
with all the nuances of a spoilt child howling for
its parent. One day a visitor called j and th«
cockatoo lady was surprised to see her guqst get-
ting more and more uncomfortable as the visit
progressed, until at last she rose abruptly to take
sudden leave. In the hall they met pretty
cooky, screaming as usual, whereupon the visitor’s
mien altered on the instant. “Oh,” she said,
with a relieved expression, “I thought it was your
poor little child crying for you all the time, and I
wondered how you could sit there 1”
In a recent scandal concerning a doctor and
a barmaid, the allegedly-injured wife was, so
goes the story, told by her husband that ho
intended marrying Flossie if adivoreeoame about.
“ Humbug !” said she. “ How can a medical man
afford to fly in the face of society ? The day I
leave you sees you a ruined man. My dear sir,
please remember that you cannot afford the luxury
of a barmaid for a wife.”
Which strikes me as being the most business*
like reply on record under the circumstances. Nc
tears, no shrieks, no reproaches—simply cold
horse-sense. And yet it Was possibly a long
course of common-sense, unrelieved by a ray of
emotional weakness, which sent the erring doctor
on a voyage of discovery after a less stoical female
companion.
“It isn’t asking much,” chirrups DecimaMoore,
in the “Gaiety Girl,” “that everyone’s a lady
who behaves herself as such ”—though opinions
differ as to what constitutes a perfect lady and a
vulgar person, nowadays. At a recent M.L.
fancy fair, I’m told, the art stall was run by a
number of haw-haw young women in the attire of
Greek maidens. To.these pets of society came a
male outsider vvho, elated by winning a picture,
offered to act as whipper-in to his brother out-
siders. His offer was ardently accepted with
many thanks for his kaindness, don’toherknow,
and the raffle business boomed, and the classic
damsels were so condescendingly gracious that the
galoot thought his social fortune was made. The
idea so inflated him that at parting he proffered
his paw to the presiding genius, and so brought
about his downfall. Drawing herself up, “No,
thank you,” she said, icily, “ I really don’t know
you !” Evidently the vice-regal example of indis-
criminate pump-handling is thrown away on the
uppercrust in the land of the moa.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Samoa has just held its first cotoner’s
inquest. The world moves. It is not so very
long ago that the practice of holding coroners’
inquests would have interfered considerably with
the fresh-meat supply of the Samoan chiefs.
At Liverpool (Eng.) recently, a Crimean
veteran, aged over 70 years, found a shelter for
his old, ignoble bones in the workhouse. At next
meeting of the “vestry,” or Board of Guardians,
or whatever the authority is called, it was seriously
proposed to eject the ancient soldier on the
ground that “it wasn’t right to encourage that
sort of people.” The workhouse gruel isn’t a
very lavish form of encouragement, but even that
was regarded as excessive. Next time The Bul-
letin hears Charles Arnold singing the joyous
song of “ Tommy Atkins ” —especially that part
where he speaks of T.A. as his country’s special
pride—it will think of that Liverpool Board if
Guardians, and the battered hero in the work
house who ought not to be “ encouraged.”
Phil May gave an ex-
hibition of his drawings in
London, the other day. He
intended to welcome pat-
rons with a bashful, but
not too bashful smile (like
this), when, as recited in a
recent Bulletin, he was
thrown from his horse and
broke his jaw. The humor-
ous account says that
“ Mr. May was not even
riding at a gallop at the
time of the accident, but
was walking along quietly
when his horse shied at a
newspaper.” If the newspaper was an old Bulle-
tin containing Hop’s picture of Phil May on
horseback, the incident would be intelligible.
At time of writing the bailiff siege of
Sydney Truth still continues. All sorts of
dodges are said to have been tried to gain admis-
sion. The other day a well-dressed man went to
the office and interviewed editor Taylor through
the bars, saying he wanted to have a little
private conversation—would Taylor let him in for
a few minutes? He was an intending candidate
for Parliament and wished to consult the editor
about his election-address. “ Very sorry,” said
Taylor, ‘‘to hear that you have been in gaol.
However, the cleverest of us are found out now
and then.” “But I haven’t been in gaol,”
shrieked the suspected bailiff. “Goulburn
gaol, did you say? ” said Taylor—"it’s a deuced
cold place in winter.” Then the “candidate,”
who had begun to froth at the mouth, was led
away by his friends. Here is a slab from editor
Taylor’s solemn-warning (apropos of an alleged
threatened battering-ram assault at his offict-
door)
“Our .house is our oastle,” and we will riddle with
bullets every man that behaves as a burglar and attempts
to break in. To the officers of the law, acting under
lawful process, we offer no active resistance ; but the first
private detective, or detective’s bravo, that puts unlawful
hands on our castle will sleep with his fathers— pour
encourager les autres. P.S.-The Staff will meet for
Revolver Drill after Church Parade to-morrow.—By
order. J
As Taylor declines to endorse any arrangement
which would still leave to plaintiff the right of
putting defendant Willis into the debtors’ prison
for a year, negotiations for a settlement have
failed.

Baron Yon Mueller, who celebrated the

Two popular skippers on the Howard
Smith s.s. line are named Joy and Pain. Not only
in name are they the two extremes, for one is
short and stout, while the other is tall and thin.
Murderer Bertrand, at latest, was in
America, studying modern improvements in den-
tistry. As it is 28 years since he practised his
profession, theonce-skilful Bertrand has a lot to
learn.
Had Oscar Wilde got off he meant to come
to Australia with one of the Douglases, and live
“somewhere in trie wild bush ” until the memory
of his exploits had faded. But it was ordered
otherwise.
Henniker Heaton has again been returned
unopposed for Canterbury, England, but the
general Australisn expectation that he would be
the new British Premier seems to have been dis-
appointed.
In his first public speech at Adelaide,
Bishop Harmer used the personal pronoun “ I ”
59 times in three-quarters of a column of S.A.
Advertiser. The reporter magnanimously sliced
some of them out, too.
Miss Melb. Punch Murphy has been made
a member of the British Society of Authors. The
Austral Salon confidently expects that she will be
presented to Queen Victoria before long as '“the
first Australian lady journalist.”
“Jim” Brunker, son of the N.S. Wales
Colonial-Secretary, has been asked to contest Dur-
ham with H. H. Brown. Once, when the matter
was mentioned to Brunker, sen., he replied: “One
fool in the family is quite enough.”
The next Australian knight, if he can

less John Hotson, of Newport (Vic.) freezing

Mrs. Caple has just died in Melb., aged
92. She was the widow of the Oollins-street book-
seller, precursor of Mullen and Robertson. Coppin

drowning of G. V. Brooke, in the London.
A N.S.W. legal luminary has (perhaps for
ever) renounced spiritualism. A very fashionable
coterie of spiritualasses lately invited him to
illuminate their circle with his hard smile, but he
declined. His reply is said to have been a
stinger.
Judge Docker (N.S.W.) is cynical enough
to be the proprietor of a “ record ” liver. The
other day he gave a prisoner five years’ gaol for a
big larceny. “You might as well sentence me for
life,” exclaimed the astonished thief. “I can’t,”
snuffled the Judge.
Hori Grey’s father was killed at Badajoz,
in the Peninsular War, in 1812. Grey himself
began his successful and marvellously-plucky sur-
vey of the Westralian coast in ’37, and he was
gazetted Governor of S.A. in Dec. ’4O. He has
surely earned rest.
Australia’s smallest policeman is on view
at Melb. Public Library. He recalls the little
old man who had the same post years ago, and
who single-handed captured the notorious “Capt.”
Melville. The captain was supposed to be armed
to the teeth. The little policeman waited for him
round a corner, tripped him up, and handcuffed
him in short order.
Mr. Wallace, the Australian chess-cham-
pion, played much more strongly in Melbourne
against Esling than he did some 18 months ago in
Sydney with ex-champion Crane, He is now to
visit Adelaide (S.A.), where, in the modest retired-
champion, Henry Charlick, a tough opponent
could be found for him.
The one-armed and hard-up Michael
Davitt, like the whole-souled man he is, will
devote the entire proceeds of his future Australian
lectures and meetings to supporting the election
fund of the Irish party. It is pathetic that such
sacrifices should be accepted at the hands of a man
with so splendid a record of self-abnegation and
suffering.
Since last year, and partly by the develop-
ments in the Dean case, Premier Kingston has
been converted into an opponent of capital punish-
ment. He lately spoke in S.A. Assembly in
favor of its abolition. It is unfortunate, however,
that the S.A. Labor-member who moves for the
abolition of the gallows also agitates for the
abolition of the Parliamentary refreshment-bar.
Sydneyites have sniggered vastly at the
Review of Reviews’ history oh N.S.W. Civil
Service Commission, prefaced by a gigantic por-
trait of the wild-eyed Mr. Percy R. Meggy, and
including a microscopic picture of that utterly un-
important person, Secretary Teece, of the trumpery
little A.M.P. Society. Editor Fitchett seems to
have a big grip of the relative sizes of things.
Matthew Davies, who is blossoming out
again as a social personage, now resides in Joli-
monb, and goes to church in a silk hat of brilliant
shinyness, frock coat of faultless cut, yellow dog-
skin gloves harmonising with his beard, and
patent-leather boots. The ever-eomely Matthew
is a vision of loveliness, and it is doubtful whether
any one of his late creditors cuts so impressive an
appearance.
Agent-General Playford lately enquired of
Lord Ripon “if it was necessary to appear in
Windsor uniform ’’at the Queen’s Birthday recep-
tion. Answer was “Yes,” and “ Honest Tom ”
didn’t go. “ They’ll have me in evening-dress or
not at all,” said Tom, some time ago, and he
seems to stick to it. At British official receptions
the most noticeable man is the American Minister,
who always wears plain evening-dress.
Mr. M. J. Conlon, the winner of the
N.S.W. bowling championship and gold medal
for ’94-5, is a native of Wollongong. Twice
previously he won the championship—in ’9l-2 and
’92-3 —and twice he was in the semi-final contest.
His career of triumph started long time ago.
He was runner-up and winner of second prize in
the “John Dawson trophy” matches, ’B5 ; winner
Glebe president’s trophy in ’9O; runner-up for
interprovineial champion medal, Victoria v. N.S.
Wales, ’B9 ; was one of the captains of the Glebe
club, which won the valuable trophy presented by
MONEY “SIDE” AND FUNNY SIDE.
OLD PARTY : " That man, 1 assure you, wouldn’t deign to notice
me during boom-time, lout now he never passes with-
out smiling. Adversity has taken the conceit out of
him. ”
STPIT PARTY : “And given him a sense of humor, perhaps.”
Mr. John Young (president of N.S.W. Bowling
Association); was one of the captains who won
the “ Crawford Shield ” for the Glebe club, ’9l-2 ;
captain of first champion rink against all clubs,
which won for the Glebe club in ’94; winner of
the Redfern president’s trophy, ’95 ; and was the
most successful captain in interprovineial matches
for N.S.W. against Victoria and Maoriland. Mr.
Conlon is a modest man, and wears his honors
worthily. For four years he was president of the
Glebe club. He now plays for Redfern.
Vic. ex-Premier Shiels has been absent from
Parliament this session by order of his doctor.
Heart-trouble is said to be the cause. His friends
fear that it will be impossible for him to take a
leading part in politics again. Shiels’ Casterton
programme was probably the most thoroughly-
comprehensive democratic bill-of-fare ever pub
forward by an Australian Premier; and his
Government ran away from it as soon as it was
enunciated.
The most exasperating variety of parson
inflicted on a suffering country is the weeping sin-
shifter. One Australian Legislative Council holds
a choice example, who used to also run a paper.
Too busy to prepare a full-time oration, he would
gently slide on to the story of two brothers, equally
gifted and well-trained, one of whom became an
utter reprobate, the other a shining light. Here
the preacher would break down completely and
blurt out the awful truth. He was the saintly
brother.
Dr. Harmer, the new S. A. Anglican
bishop, is a little man, with a clean-shaved, fat
face mounted with glasses. A plain, unimpres-
sive little fellow, who would have made his fortune
in the “Private Secretary.” The bishop’s legs
alone are a poem, especially when viewed from the
rear, and would be the especial delight of “Hop,
who has never been provided with a legitimate
successor to Pastor Jefferies. The new bishop is
a rapid speaker, and appears to have intellectual
and oratorical powers far above those of his pre-
decessor, Kennion.
Apropos the fact that comedian Wilfrid
Shine fainted in Melb. gaol immediately the un-
moved Buck walked on to the gallows to be
hanged, and so saw nothing of the actual specta-
cle : What a peculiar attraction morbid sights
appear to have for people who are too weak-nerved
to stand them ! Any regular attendant at execu-
tions will tell of the number of persons who
clamour for admission-tickets, and then, in terror,
turn their backs on the hideous show they have
taken so much trouble to attend.
G. Republican Dibbs was not always a mere
politician. In March, ’73, he was one of a party
dining at Sydney Exchange, when a man from
China began whooping up the Shanghai amateur
scullers, of whom he was on his own showing,
one of the best. Dibbs bet this gentleman,
Lindsay by nam ■, that he, a mere had-been, could
beat him for a dinner for twenty. Full as they
were of turkey and bitters, the pair and their
followers adjourned to the S.R.C. shed, borrowed
a couple of club skiffs and rowed the match round
Pinchgut, the “ long cove” winning easily.
Re Parkes’ well-known advocacy of Woman
Suffrage, the old man once presided at a large
public meeting of sympathisers in the cause, and,
having taken the various women under his wing,
gave forth an encouraging “Hear, hear,” at
frequent intervals, until one of the number, in
the manner peculiar to certain feminine orators,
became effusive on the question of sex morality,
and expressed the hope that, with the advent of
Woman Suffrage, the male politician of doubtful
morals would be completely extinguished. Then
a deep and awful silence fell upon that meeting.
“Sam’’Lyons, Premier
Turner’s law - partner, is

Dear Bulletin, —The
author of the “Bottles”
rhymes on the Northern Ter-
ritory, which you recently
reprinted, is the Rev. W. A.
Millikan. The same parson
(a Wesleyan) said t’other
day:— “I am confident the
white man could work in the
Territory as well as any
other race of people if he
were only steadier in his
habits of life. It is the drink
question that is disqualify-
ing him to cope with his
steadier yellow brother.”—

“It is not generally
known,” writes a Bulletin
correspondent, “that Joseph
Chamberlain, Secretary of
State for the Colonies in the
new Salisbury Government,
visited Australia nearly 40
years ago. While in Mel-
bourne he sought to take
back to England an Aus-
tralian wife. A daughter of
an eminent Sydney lawyer
(afterwards a Judge) was
then staying in Melbourne
at the house of Coroner
Youl. Mr. Chamberlain
met the fair one and was
smitten. Day after day and
night after night, for months,
he dropped in at the young
coroner’s and looked softly
through his eye-glass at the
Judge’s daughter. But after
a six months’ stay in Mel-
bourne and a look round
Sydney, Joseph returned to
England. The fair one after-
wards married a Melbourne
barrister, who deserted the
bar for the schoolroom. Mr.
Chamberlain has also mar-
ried since and married,
and married, arid his third
wife is a rich American.”
Louis Becke’s second collection of South
Sea stories will probably be issued in London in
two separate volumes in time for Xmas. Since
his “ By Reef and Palm ” appeared, London pub-
lishers have had quite a crop of South Sea yarns
offered them by various writers, none of which,
however, have been thoughtgood enough to take up.
Included in the first volume will be, with other
Bulletin stories of Becke’s, “The Cook of the
Spreeto Santo.” It will bednteresting to ,know
whether British decorum will stand the shook of
such a tale of beachcombing life’in Bully Hayes’
time.
The eye-trouble from which Trenwith,
leader of the Vic. Labor-party, has been suffering
for some months past v has become so serious that
he is now almost blind. *He is quite unable to
read print, even with a powerful glass. When he
wishes to quote a passage in Parliament, it has to
be read for him by a colleague ; and his son has to
read the newspapers to him daily. This trouble ia
likely to spoil a useful political career. Trenwith
is by far the most brainy member of his partft
and a certain first Minister of Labor, when *
Labor department shall have been established io
Victoria.
Baron Von Mueller’s presents on the
anniversary of his 70th birthday included enough
flowers to stock a florist’s, besides cakes, pin-
cushions, photos., books, and—a pet weakness of
his —a knitted comforter. The Baron is never seen
without at least two of them. He complained of
bad sore throat the day after : he had talked with-
out intermission from 8 a.m. till 11 p.m. He will
often spend an hour explaining in careful detail
why he hasn’t time to talk to you. Along with
these weaknesses the veteran scientist has perhaps
done more lo help Australian talent to the front,
and said less about it, than any other man.
HUNDREDS OF GOOD FELLOWS DIE
EVERY DAY YET “ THIS ” LIVES ON.
Premier Seddon, of Maoriland, on a recent
visit to the West Coast, was waited on by a depu-
tation of stone-breakers, who complained that
their heaps of road - metal were not properly
measured by the official in charge. In proof
whereof they asked Seddon to come and measure
them himself. Thereupon the Premier went forth
through a drizzling rain with a tape measure in
his capacious red hand, accompanied by the
resident engineer and the road overseer and the
oldest inhabitant, and followed by all the muddy
small boys of the town, and personally measured
about two dozen heaps of road-metal. Then the
deputation expressed its thanks in a few well-
chosen remarks.
An influential N.S. W. politician, was in
the habit of borrowing from the late Judge
Josephson, at whose house he would present him-
self periodically to “square the bill” —with
another bill. “ But you have given me a bill for
.£3OO, and the amount is only a little over £200,”
tiie Judge would say. “Ob, never mind,” the
politician would retort, “ you can just give me a
cheque for the difference.” And so things would
go on until the Judge would say—at least, he did
say once, to his own cost —“ How on earth do we
stand ? Do you owe me money, or do I owe you
money?” “I’m blessed if I know,” replied the
great statesman, calmly, “but I suppose we’d
better call it level.” And so the roller was passed
over ,£BOO. Credat Judaeus!
The Abrahams quartette of Melb. gun-
forgers consists of Emanuel, about 30 years
of age, and Louis, Edward and Alfred,
ranging from 25 to 20; the three latter are so
strikingly alike as to be almost undistinguishable
when apart. The present writer was in court
during the whole trial of JO days and could not
now positively identify any of this trio. Indeed,
it is asserted that the contractor who built the
Abrahams mansion in Drummond-st., Carlton, had
to go without a number of his “extras” owing
to his inability to positively swear which of
the brothers ordered them. Physically, the
Abrahams are miserable little rats, all about
the same height (sft.) and build (Bat.), but, with
the exception of Emanuel, there is nothing strik-
ingly Semitic in their appearance.
William Creswell, Parramatta Asylum
insane patient, believed by many to be the real
Roger Tichborne, was well-known in the neigh-
borhood of Queanbeyan, N.S.W., nearly 30 years
ago. Even then there were vague rumors as to his
identity vyith the rauoh-talked-of baronet. He
married an hotel-keeper at Gundaroo, but the
marriage does not appear to have been a happy
one. Mrs. C., whose business had, been fairly
prosperous, once deputed her lord and master to
go to Sydney and make some necessary purchases,
entrusting him with a cheque for <£7oo for that
purpose. After being away for more than a fort-
night, and having bad a high old time while the
money lasted, he returned with nothing more to
show for his trip than a 15s. bonnet,, which he
tendered as a solatium to the outraged feelings of
his expectant better-half.

Premier Kingston has sent a letter of
sympathy and encouragement to Premier Reid, for
whose success- against the Council he publicly
prays.
It is well to remember that the genesis of
the Parkesian Federal movement was the appear-
ance of a Protectionist majority in N.S.W.
Assembly.
One N.S.W. country candidate says frankly
he endorses the Council’s action in rejecting the
Land Tax Bill, because he is himself the possessor
of 4000 acres.
The Age rejoices over the alleged fact
that Socialism makes very little progress in Vic-

meetings, ignoring both the local Fabian Society
and the Social Democratic Federation.
Melb. Chamber of Commerce considers
that Eight Hours’ Day should not be a public

Reading a eulogistic note on Graham
Berry, in a Melb. Tory print, one reflects again
on all the last general election meant for him,
when he chucked his “ Sir ” into the fire, and
picked it out again—like Mrs. Ebbsmith with her
Bible.
The new Maoriland Immigration Bill pro-
hibits the importation of labor unless workmen
are unobtainable in the province ; and raises the
poll-tax on Asiatics to £lOO, while decreasing the
number in proportion to tonnage which a vessel
may bring.
Maoriland House of Representatives threw
out the Bill providing for a lottery of the B.N.Z.’s
estates by a majority of nearly four to one. The
pious element of the House had its eye partly on
the sinfulness of the proposal and partly on the
fact that all such lotteries have been a dead
failure of late years. Nothing aggravates the
good Presbyterian so much as being invited to
commit a sin which won’t pay.

An extraordinary request
coming from a party that
declares the secular system
has already destroyed the
moral strength of the com-
munity. A verdict for the

garded by the parsons as a
melancholy demonstration of
its evil influence upon the
minds and morals of the
people.
Premier Nelson styles
the Q. Labor-party a faction
because it won’t follow the
“constitutional ” method of
unity with the Opposition,
and appoint a common leader
to confer with the Premier.
The incident is but one more
sign of the early break-up of
Government by Contradic-
tion. Browne, M.P., found
this as a definition of “ fac-
tion”:—“Any party which
abuses the power and public
authority with which it has
been entrusted.” The con-
cluding steps of the syllo-
gism were absurdly simple.
All Oppositionist Powers’ ability doesn’t
seem able to change the popular belief, well or ill
founded, that he lacks grit, “ backbone.” It is
this feeling which gave point to Murray’s
suggestion of an Upper House of ladies, with
Powers as president.
Parkes, though he has hitherto uniformly
gathered votes from diverse interests, will be
beaten badly by Reid, despite all the money which
will be spent in aid of the old man. Against him
will be arrayed, amongst other things, an almost
solid publicans’ vote. Many publicans are Pro-
tectionists, but ju«t as “ we are all Socialists,” so,
in matters directly affecting our livelihood, we are
all individualists. Reid has ever been the publi-
cans’ pet ; Parkes has uniformly toyed with the
teetotal saints, and, strange to say, even with the
social-purity brigade.
One good point about Premier Reid : he
is amenable to “ reason.” When you sing out to
him, “ Gee up, Bawley !” he sometimes fails to
respond instantaneously, but once you flourish the
bullock-whip in earnest, and knock a bit of hide
off him, he comes right up to yoke and pulls “ like
a little horse.”
N.S.W. Premier Reid, it may safely be
asserted, is far and away the best platform—
“mob”—orator in Australia. Not only this, but
he has of late exhibited so much astuteness of the
Parkesian order, that his veteran rival must now
feel himself in the position of the eagle stricken
by the arrow feathered from his own wing.
Brisbane Courier :
For another thing, the N.S. W. law which makes attempt

to make attempt equal to completion is had law, and it is
especially bad where the penalty attached is irreversible.
It is certain that in the Dean case popular dissatisfaction
was aggravated by the fact that death punishment was
pronounced on a man for a living woman.
There are nearly 700 Japs in Torres Straits
and 200 more are coming. They run the boarding-
houses, ship-building slips, stores (about 15),

remedy, as powerful Q. politicians are intimately

The row in the Victorian woollen-tiade
has produced one very important admission, viz.,
that thirty-odd qualities of flannel are manufac-

Extract from a private letter from
England :
It is goodbye to George Reid’s chances of a K.C.M.G.
after his injudicious and mistaken cablegram to fiipon.
After all, there is a certain amount of courtesy observed
in official life in this country, and people are not accus-
tomed to tiie gaucherie of your Australian methods. I
wonder why Mrs. Reid allowed him to commit such a
be Use.
There you have it. The English official creed is—
every Australian politician has his price, and that
price is a title.
Ex-Republican Dibbs’ statement that the
British Govt, would, as likely as not, refuse to
pass an Enabling Bill for the amendment of the
N.S.W. Constitution, is the puny, grovelling cry
of a voice lost in an electioneering wilderness.
Britain is now—worse luck !-very wide awake as
to the value of the Australian connection. The
ultimate victories of the Chinese Restriction Act
and the Marriage with a Deceased Wife’s Sister
Act., &c., &0., are instances, also, that should
discourage even the blundering Dibbs from further
acts of Imperial worship.

The Q. Early-Closing Bill won’t apply to
chemists, confectioners, fish, vegetable, fruit and
refreshment vendors, restaurants, tobacconists,
booksellers, hairdressers, undertakers, or pubs.
Also, shops where there are no employes other
than members of the tradesman’s family are
excepted. Further, the Bill only works by local
option, and it won’t come into force in any dis-
trict unless 200 electors sign a petition in its
favor ; and this petition may be overset if a poll is
demanded by 200 other electors. With so many
exemptions, and so many difficulties put in the
way of enforcing the Act, the measure is plainly
a dead letter. The Govt., indeed, never intended
it otherwise; but it is thought the pretence of
popular legislation will catch some foolish votes
for the election.
Premier Kingston has written the Colonial
Office very plainly re vice-regal salaries and
emoluments. ,£5OOO a year, he remarks, is too
much to pay the Governor of S. A., who, even if
he is lavishly hospitable, only entertains “dis-
tinguished visitors,” who don’t need attention,
and the so-called “Society” of Adelaide, which
comprises but a very small section of the general
community. The democracy’s ideal should be to
find and elect from among its own ranks a
Governor who, like (say) George Higinbotham,
would, by reason of his obvious innate nobility,
cub a commanding figure if he lived in a four-
roomed cottage, and who would look dignified
even while publicly buying a sixpenny leg of
mutton and cramming it into a rusty black bag.
Dear Bulletin, —Be “the people and
business.” the alleged failure of democracies
through indifference and soulless negligence just
as much to them living generally in a climate
favorable to development of large and sluggish
livers? I notice that when the new-chum from
Britain, Canada or any of the cold climates takes
hold of any work or business in Australia he is far
and away more energetic and pushing than our
own people, whose character! die attitude, as
Miss Floral Shaw said, is “leaning against
a post. ” Once the cold-country man is properly
acclimatised his energy disappears, and he becomes
“one of us.” Democracy would seem hopelessly
unable to run State or any other business until
some saviour of his country shall “arise,” and,
after making due provisions for the after-effects,
start forth on a mission to the citizens of this
glorious land, armed with many tons of over-
proof liver-tonic. —Source.
If Premier Reid comes back to power, the
Bill for the reformation of N.S. W. Council may,
with energy and good luck, and assuming that the
tail of the fatted nominees is considerably down and
there is very little fight in them, pass by the end
oftheyear. It may takelS months or five years’ hard
fighting,, but it is quite safe to assert that it won’t
pass before the beginning of ’96. Then, assuming
that the existing Councillors stand to their guns
in the matter of the Land and Income Tax, and
that all the newly-appointed Councillors are
favorable to the measure and continue so, the
requisite majority to pass the Land and Income
Tax Bill should be available some time in ’9B,
and, allowing for the time necessary to get the
machinery in working order, the tax should be
collected for the first time during the financial
year ending 30th June, ’99. If there is a long
fight over the Reform Bill, and the old Council-
lors have any real grit in them, it may be a year
later. And if the new democratic nominees
petrify in the atmosphere of Eroperty, as almost
all previous democrats have done, then it may be
at any date which is absolutely and hopelessly
indefinite. However, all these difficulties must be
faced sooner or later, and Reid deserves some
credit for trying to turn later into sooner.

Since Louis Becke’s South Sea stories ap-
peared in The Bulletin, he has received batches
of letters from all sorts of people, who want to go
down to the islands and catch the wild goat by
the beard and investigate the deplorably bad con-
dition of local morals. Some of these letters are
from young men; but most are from old married
men. One man says that he has a new cocoanut-
dessieator, whioh he would either give in return
for passage or show natives how to work ; another
only wants to get to some quiet spot where he can
get some light, agreeable employment (lying in a
hammock, eating squashy fruit, with a native girl
to brush off the flies, is this man’s “dart ”). An-
other man has “ a good deal of household furni-
ture, bed-linen, &c., and a lot of rough experience,
and thinks the life would suit him ” (what has
he done with his wife?). Two brothers in N.Q.
are willing to do “any darned thing”—would
prefer to go in for cattle-breeding there (Becke
says that some of the coral atolls are so narrow
that a cow sniffing the sea breeze on the ocean
side would have her tail hanging over the glassy
surface of the lagoon on the other side); and then
one pious gentleman thinks that, as he once filled
a position of trust in a mercantile house at Per-
nambuco, where the temptations (what ki.nd,_

The Trustees, Executors and Agency Co.
(Melb.) shows a profit of £305 for the half-year ended
June 30, and pays no div. The profits for the previous
half-year were £2265, and for the one ended June, '94,
£2287, so that the apparent falling-off is something
serious. It is, however, more apparent than real. In the
boom days, when everybody had “confidence,” it was
the company’s custom, when an estate was placed in its
Hands for realisation, to take credit in advance for com-
mission on the entire amount. Realisation, however,
proceeds so slowly nowadays that it has decided to swear
off this unsafe practice, and only take credit for commis-
sion on amounts actually realised. This should put the co.
in a much safer position, though it means a serious reduc-
tion in the visible profitsfor a little while. In other respects
things only look moderately well. Compared to the state
of things a year ago, rents received have declined by
£256, or a fall of 40 per cent., and interest receipts have
fallen off by £77, and against this total expenses have
increased by £42. Office expenses, in particular, have
increased by £145. A year ago the company had
a mortgage of £35,000 on its property, and a similar sum
set aside to pay it off on maturity, and the difference in
the interest paid and that received resulted in a loss of
£320 for the six months. The mortgage is now reduced
to £25,000, but instead of the difference diminishing it
has increased to £462. The investments (£107,253), mostly
in 4 per cent. Govt, stock, debentures,/fixed deposits
and “mortgages and other advances,” only yield 3J per
cent, per annum, which seems to suggest that some of the
advances are paying no interest whatever. There appears
among the investments “set aside to meet mortgage on
freehold property £35,000,” but where this money
is, or what securities there are to represent it, is
not explained. And, though the co. has £65,000 worth
of freehold property, its half-year’s income from “ rent ”
is only .£376, while its outgo for “rent and taxes” is
£577, The £65,000 worth of property thus represents a
dead loss of £2Ol, instead of an income. A somewhat
similar state of things was shown on two previous half-
years. Also, it excites a little passing interest that the
co. should have set aside £3s,ooo—which is invested in
some way totally unexplained—to meet a £35,000 mort-
gage, and should have paid off £lO,OOO of the mortgage
without, so far as the balance-sheet shows, any way
reducing the amount alleged to be set aside. Altogether,
the Trustees, Executors and Agency Co.’s sheet is not so
full of information as it might be.
* * * *
That exceedingly hopeless concern, the Free-
hold Investment and Banking Co. (Melb.), has yet another
reconstruction scheme on hand. Its main features are
that £5 per share of the original co.’s capital, and all its
reserve funds, be written off as lost, which goes without
saying, as the fact that they are lost is already apparent.
A new co. with a nominal capital of £500,000 is to be
formed out of the debris of the old shareholders—those
who are not in the Benevolent Asylum, or sleeping out
beside the Yarra, or gone mad, or suicided, or missing ;
and the creditors are to he paid with the new co.’s deposit-
receipts, bearing interest at 5 per cent., to the amount of
about £1,300,000. As the 00. has no present means of
paying the said interest—the interest would amount
to at least £60,000 a year, .and last year’s income,
apart from calls, did little more than cover ex-
penses—the 5 per cent, is to be provided, not in
cash, but in new deposit-receipts, so that the bank’s
liabilities will multiply alarmingly. The proposal looks
too hopeless to be worth serious consideration. If the
interest on the deposit-receipts were fixed at 1J per cent,
there would at least be a prospect of some good result.
The present suggestion only amounts to this: The
creditors may be induced, by the very remote prospect
of payment in full with 5 per cent, interest, to accept the
arrangement. And, as the said arrangement authorises
the co. to owe all its debts indefinitely, and to pay the
interest on its paper by issuing more paper, and to owe it
indefinitely also, the pressure of calls will be relaxed,
and the bank may keep on owing its debts comfortably
until further notice. There is an atmosphere of calm and
profound rest about the scheme, but that seems to be
nearly all there is about it.

The selling value of all the stocks—including
Govt, debentures, bank-shares and deposits, steamboat,
insurance, gas, brewery, coal, silver, financial companies’
and miscellaneous shares in N.S. Wales—has risen in the
last six months by £5,000,000. The province is no richer
in reality, but it feels £5,000,000 better off, and confidence
has been restored to that extent.

The full text of the City of Melbourne Bank’s
second reconstruction scheme varies in just one particular
from the cabled report, the difference being that both the
31 and the P er cent, stock are redeemable only at the
bank’s option, on six months’ notice. The City of Mel-
bourne thus—if the scheme is adopted—gets its deposit
iponey at 2Jper cent, all round (to be raised to 3 percent,
if. profits admit), and redeemable solely at its own con-
venience. This is something like a reconstruction.

So far as The Bulletin knows, the eminent
accountant, Mr. Young, of Turquands, Young and Co,,
London, has never put foot in the "colonies,”
yet the Scotch and English creditors of the City
of Melbourne Bank are practically asked to rely on
his valuation of that institution’s Yio. assets, and on
that valuation accept much less than they bargained for
when the bank was “ born again,” How on earth can
Mr. Young, or anyone else who has never visited Victoria,
be able to appraise the value of the bank’s securities
against the overdrafts of, say, a big furniture firm, acolossal
land-boomer, a speculative stationer, an engineering
firm, a squatting co., or a huge auctioneering concern?
Amongst clients as various as these, who may or may not
be good for all they owe, it is alleged that the bank has a
huge amount outstanding. Thebank’s envoy to England in
this matter, is not, all things considered, the person
whom a shrewd board of directors would put forward to
plead their cause. Should his and Mr. Young’s scheme
"come off” the British, speculator can hereafter be
regarded as a sheep in wolf’s clothing.

Great Britain’s loans are issued on the simple
basis that the State can repay any time it likes after a
jertain number of years, but the lender can never demand
repayment. Consequently, when times are good, the
mother country does a conversion operation and reduces
the rale of interest, and at other times she simply holds
on. Australasia issues her loans repayable at fixed
dates, and when they f ill due she has to renew, no matter
how disastrous the op -ration may be. The renewal of
one £2,500,000 loan, which fell due at a time of great dis-
tress, cost Queensland just £300.000. Next year, over
£6,000,000 of Australian debts fall due; £8,000,000 fall
due in 1898: 412,000,000 in 1915; £13,000,000 in 1918;
£31,000,000 in 1924 ; and £29,000,000 in 1927, with smaller
sumsiu between. If two or three of these happen to be years
of panic, the mere operation of renewal may cost this
miserable country £5,000,000. M<anvvhile, but for the
fixed date arrangement, these provinces could do a con-
version operation now which would save ±900,000 a year
in interest. Yet the alleged financiers of Australia still
adhere to the old, disastrous system-apparently from

The City Mutual Life Assurance Society replies
to some recent "comments : Dear Bulletin, —No bonus-
paying life office in the world, doing a large new business
in proportion to its renewal income, values on a "pure
premium” basis. The “loading” on the pure premium
averages about 25 per cent, It is the almost universal cus-
tom to allow, as commissions alone, 40 to 50 per cent, of
the first year’s premiums. It works out all right, as I have
fully explained to the Record, the next number of whioh
I trust you will have time to glance at. The City Mutual’s
standard of valuation, by the way, is stricter than that of
two of our largest and wealthiest Australian offices.
Because we w#re prudent enough to put by some money
to reserve-fund during the past couple of years, you point
out that our net rate of interest has fallen to under 5 per
cent. Do yoU know that the net rate of one very large
office last year fell to £3 155., yet they valued the bulk of
their policies at this rate? The City Mutual is working on
the safest of safe lines and has one of the soundest connec-
tions in the province.—Qko. Crowlky, Manager.

The Federal Bank, which has already called up
£1 per share, makes another call of 30s. which will
exhaust the unpaid capital. The liabilities are now
£1,254,000, and the assets are vaguely supposed to be
worth £711,000. The call should realise £240,000, but it
is expected to produce only £50,000, so the probable end
of the Federal Bank will be about 10s. or 12s. in the £. The
deficit, roughly speaking, will tot up to £600,000, inde-
pendent of the legal costs and winding-up exes. Once more
the question arises—to what end were those precious costs
incurred ? The ruined bank dissipated a lot of money in
procuring awful revelations, which set a learned Judge
sighing and shaking his head, and afterwards—Nothing.
The depositors have been compelled to sacrifice a morsel
of dividend on the altar of humbug.

There are scores of .£5 notes (unnumbered and

Westralia, and N.S.W., printed from the plates of the
long-bung Provincial and Suburban Bank, Limited. The
■writer has seen eight of them which have been forwarded
by the remote branches of several good banks for collec-
tion in Melb. Judged by the newness of the notes, and
the fact that they are unnumbered and unsigned, there
is evidently a stock of them which has been overlooked,
or the plates have not been destroyed. The Provincial
and Suburban Bank (Ltd.) was “liquidated” eight years
ago, and there are no assets left. Another reason for a
State paper currency. Nobody has to try to remember
whether the State is still in existence or not.

policy. Every Government and local loan should have a

During the first three months of ’95 Victoria
exported 72,000 gallons of wine ; South Australia, 68,000

The Vic, Govt, is brutally candid in its reduc-
tion of the bottled-beer duties. Minister of Customs
Best says that the result of the high duty has
been decreased consumption and a heavy decline in
the revenue, and the aim of tariff revision in
the matter of malt liquor is to make the popu-
lation more boozy. It will be against the local wine in-
dustry; but what of that? The taste for wholesome wine
is only in its infancy, whereas the belief in British beer is
established, and worth encouraging for the sake of—the
revenue. However, the remission of one penny per quart
is not likely to stimulate the demand for ’Ome-brewedale
and stout. By June next year Victoria will probably
have discovered that the revenue made a stupid mistake
by which a few importers profited.

An authoritative ruling as to what constitutes
fair interest is needed in N.S.W. Justice Manning
ordered the Bank of N.S.W. to pay Mrs. Pieroy (Augusta
Dargon) 5 per cent, interest during the time it withheld
from her the £3OOO odd sweep-money. Now, 5 per cent;,
is neither the bank-rate on deposits nor the rate charged
by the bank on overdrafts. In 1834 the Legislative Coun-
cil fixed 8 per cent, as the legal figure, but right along
from that day Judges determined the rate according to
their private ideas, and now no man can tell whether in
any case the rate will be 4 per cent, orB. M’Farlane.M.P.,
had a Bill before N.S. W. Parliament on the subject, hut little
is expected to come from it. The new Bankruptcy Bill has
a better chance ; but in dealing with interest the Council
has shirked the difficulty by ingeniously devising that
where interest is part of a debt the creditor will receive
8 per cent, interest in the first instance out of the estate
without prejudice to his claiming higher interest after the
other debts proved in the estate have been paid in full.
Moses will thus get 8 per cent, to start with, and if any of
the estate survives the proved debts he may strike in for
the other 92 per cent. The question is a difficult one to
settle, but it is admitted on all hands that there are exor-
bitant rates and fairly common-sense rates, and as most
countries of Europe have fixed a rate which governs legal
decisions there is no reason why N.S.W. judicial awards
should continue to be so various and apparently hap-
hazard as they are.

Block 14 (8.H.) is adding to its concentrating
plant, with the object of dealing with the slimes which
it produces so largely. For the week ended July 6, the
mill turned out 323 tons concentrates from 1366 tons of
crude ore, and 137 tons of “first-quality” slimes. The
slimes are sent to the smelters at Port Adelaide, but their
value the reports do not disclose. The South is also
dealing with its slimes by the addition of three huddles ;
so far, it has had but one.

South (8.H.) sulphide concentrates are wonder-

cent, of the lead and 48 per cent, of the silver in the
crude ore was saved—a much better result than any other

ore considered.

The “Green Harp swindle” is now an almost

people were ruined, and one man, who had dropped his
whole pile in the fraudulent hole, put an end to his
troubles by nearly sawing his head off with a carving
knife. And now the old, delusive Green Harp, re-
christened the Hauraki, is one of the richest mines in the

tended property, and one, estimated to go 20z., has been
tested to a depth of 60 feet and proved so far permanent.
Others look well on the surface, but have not yet been

Dear Bulletin,—Here’s how one R.C.
missionary, at all events, made a big strike in
converts. Certain place in Malay Peninsula;
soul-competition hot between Baptist parson and
Jesuit father. Natives catch half-grown tiger-
cub, put him in pit, and pelt him till liis remon-
strances bring angry mother from jungle. Tigress
riddled; but, in excitement, Baptist native falls
into pit, and the cub gets him down and lies on
him so that to shoot one is to shoot the other.
Rev. Hardshell summoned ; but, while he is be-
seeching Gawd, at a safe distance, to help our
dear ber-ruther, Father Blank conies along, bor-
rows a kris, has himself lowered into the pit, and
gives young tiger beans—receiving in return six
weeks’ broad-of-his-hack and the accession to his
flock of all the yellow Baptists, except—the man
whose life he had saved !— Macassab.

Previous to his departure for Johannes-
burg, the other day, W. A. Alexander, a Mel-
bourne tobacconist, was entertained by the Tobac-
conists Association. The President, Harry Levy,
after exhausting his stock of eulogistic phrases,
came to a stop for a moment, and then, in a burst
of broken-voiced enthusiasm, wound up with the
statement that Mr. Alexander was “in every
respect an ideal tobacconist.” Which recalls the
deceased person over whose remains nobody could
be found to pronounce a funeral eulogium until a
German in the crowd stepped forth, and looking
down on the coffin, observed briefly—“ Ach veil 1
he vos a goot schmoker.”

A London correspondent of the Akgus
comments unfavorably on the Metropolitan School
Board’s desire to encourage music among the
lowah ordahs. It seems that the reckless board
intends to introduce fiddle tuition into the evening
schools, with a view to “brightening the homes of
the people,” and the Abgus man fears the worst.
“ Already, ” he says, “the experiment of teaching
the piano has proved a costly item. On the
strength of the training obtained in the board
schools, some of the elder girls, instead of continu-
ing the honest drudgery of their parents, are start-
ing in the suburbs small music classes at sixpence
a lesson.” Mark the Tory indisposition to allow
a choice of honest drudgery to these inhabitants
of a lowah sphere ! “Genteel” people may strive
to pick, up a meagre living in a field of “genteel ”
industry, but the daughters of charwomen must
“char” or follow their natural avocation of
domestic servants, otherwise the classes become
mixed and the glorious British constitution goes
to the devil. But how about the Havveisian theory
of music and morals?

A French wine expert, engaged in examining
Australian vineyards, tells The Bulletin a few
of his experiences, and expresses astonishment at
the quality of the wines, considering the amount
of ignorance expended in their preparation. His
visit to a leading Dookie (Vic.) cellar is men-
tioned. On entering he enquired the temperature,
but was told by the proprietor and manager that
“ they did not know.” “Don’t you keep a ther-
mometer?” asked the expert. “Oh, we have
plenty at the homestead,’’replied they, “but none
down here.” “Well, how do you tell when it is
the right temperature for fermentation ?’’ “Oh,”
they replied, “we put our arms in, and when the
air in the cellar is hotter than the blood we know
it is right for fermentation.” Another man, asked
for samples of his wine, sent back several bottles
half filled. When asked why they were not full
he said “the wine was so strong ho thought it
would burst the bottles.” In another place was
found a kerosene-tin, with a perforated bottom,
and a man sitting on top to squeeze juice out!

Dear Bulletin, — On one of the W.A.
fields the other day the miners complained to a
visiting warden that the blacks had been stealing
tucker. The warden answered thus :—“ If the
niggers steal anything from you, follow them out
to their camps, and when you find them do not be
afraid to use your firearms.” That such advice
should be given to a body of men by a warden
and magistrate when acting officially is, to say
the least of it, a bit rough on the unfortunate
niggers—when considered in connection with the
facts that they are more than half-starved, conse-
quent on their hunting-grounds being over-run by
whites ; that there was a special clause relating to
the treatment of the aborigines inserted in the
Constitution Act which gave Home Rule to
W.A. ; that a large sum of money is voted
annually for the especial benefit of the natives;
and that an officer (Imperial, I think) is paid a
good round salary to see that they get fair treat-
men t. —Republican.

The absence of a dividend calls for a few explanatory remarks Our experience heretofore has
shown that the commission received on income collected in estates, trusts, and for absentees, and the
interest on our investments, have met our expenditure, leaving the commission on the corpus of estates
to pay the dividend. In anticipation of the number and value of estates being maintained, the prac-
tice of exercising our legal "right by at once taking our profit upon the sworn value of the corpus was
instituted many years back and maintained until 1892, when the diminishing revenue from this source
Lnrl the increased difficulty of winding-up estates demonstrated the undesirability of its continuance.
By iTS di.itol it w» apprehended we would gradually be enabled, without an undue
sacrifice by the shareholders, to institute the safer practice of only carrying to credit of profit a fair
proportion of the commission, taking into consideration the time the estate would be in hand , but
though the number of estates coming into our hands has been well maintained, the further decreases in
the value of corpus and the practical difficulties in the way of early realisation have impressed upon
the Board the necessity of working on closer lines, and we decided only to take to credit in the half-
year’s profits such commission on corpus as the process of realisation absolutely justifies.
By Order of the Board.

GENTLEMEN who find their Razors unsatisfactory should not fail to give onr celebrated Plum
Razor a trial. This brand of razor is something superior to any others offered to the public.
It is specially-tempered, perfectly hollow ground, rings like a bell and never requires grinding. We
can highly recommend it to the general public. Being practical tradesmen ourselves, we
know the exact kind of edge that is required to ensure an easy shave, and, having had them in use for
a number of years, can testify to their merits. We guarantee each Razor for Two Years.

A Tennyson story related by Henry Lucy.
The bard was on a yachting-voyage, and pub
in at Copenhagen, where the King of Den-
mark boarded the Pembroke Castle and
stayed to lunch, bringing with him his
daughter, the Princess of Wales. It was the
habit of Mr. Gladstone and the other guests
to assemble in the smoking-room on deck after
luncheon or dinner, and there Tennyson read, or
rather recited, some of his verse. Amongst the
guests was Miss Margot Tennant, with whose
bright personality the Laureate was much
attracted, and as she generally sat near him whilst
he read he (amiable old gentleman !) fell into the
habit of holding her hand. On the occasion of
the Copenhagen luncheon the Princess sat at the
right hand of Tennyson, who selected “ Maud ”
for his reading, and, as usual, became absolutely
absorbed in his work. When he reached the well-
known lyric, “Come into the garden, Maud,” his
right hand drooped at his side, and, finding
another there, he, accustomed bo the companion-
ship of the fascinating Margot, seized it and, it
was obvious to the shocked lookers-on, squeezed
it. Bub the Princess stood it, and did nothing to
discompose the aged poet.
Dear Bulletin, — A sample of the value
and dignity of labor in Melbourne. lam agent
for an express messenger co. which inter alia
addresses and delivers circulars. To-day I called
on a firm advertising thus ;
"WANTED, 8000 prospectuses addressed, type or
’ * handwriting. Quote rate.
I quoted 4s. a thousand, for addressing by hand,
and was told that I was “ miles out of it,” even at
typewriting rates ! Now, it takes a man all his
time to average 100 envelopes per hour, and had
I obtained the job its value per hour would have
panned out just 4fd. As the addresses had to be
picked, and not taken in rotation from a list in
the directory, the job would actually have realised
3d. Typewriting taking about 20 per cent, longer
time, it follows that the would-be successful
tenderer must have been satisfied with just about
2d. per hour, working dawn to dark tor a fort-
night ! Needless to say, the female tenderer was
well to the fore at these rates. Our company
delivers addressed envelopes, within a mile of
the G.P.0., at 3s. 6d. per 100, obtaining receipts
from the addressees, that is to say at less than
half the Post’ Office rates. Even at the figure we
rarely get jobs, seeing that plenty of firms can
put them through for considerably less. The
Paradise of the Workers? The price in London
for addressing circulars is about ss. per 1000.—

THE BIRDS WHISTLED “THE DEAD
MARCH.”
u Even the birds on the trees learned to whistle the
‘Dead March.’ ”
It was an old soldier who was talking. “We
were in camp;” he said “ in a flat, malarious part
of the country. Our Colonel was a splendid
tighter, but didn’t • aprear to have-any idea of
sanitary matters. Just then we were in more
dkuger from disease than from the enemy. Pre-
sently fever broke out and men died by the dozen.
Hardly a day but we buried some of them in the
swamp. In fact, we played the ‘ Dea f March ’
so often that I used to fancy the birds in the trees
niftd learned to whistle it. ‘ Awful sorry, you
know, boys,’ said our Colonel, ‘ but ,-o long as we
have to stay here, we can’t help having the fever.’
Vet the Colonel was wrong, as another regiment
camped near.us almost wholly escaped. But their
commander fought the malaria with sanitation
and preventive medicine. That made the differ-
ence.’’
In January, 1892, the influenza was epidemic at
Stubbing, near Chelmsford. Among the persons
attacked were Mrs. Abram Thorogood, of White
House farm, her daughter Annie, and her sons
William and Ernest. They had terrible pains in
the head, sore muscles and joints, and were very
feverish. The whole four—mother and three
children —were confined to their beds.
In a letter bn the subject Mr. Thorogood says :
“My wife became quite delirious; she did not
know where she was, and could neither get in nor
dut of bed. I gave Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup to all of them with excellent results ; the
fever soon left them, and shortly they were well
and strong as ever, and have since remained so.
I may mention that many neighbours and friends
had the same complaint as my wife and family,
but although the others had doctors and the best
attention and advice, none recovered so rapidly as
rfty people did. I thank God that I came to hear
of Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup, for although
we are a family of seven, living at home, during
the eight years I have kept it in the house we
have not needed a doctor, thus saving many
pounds in doctors’ bills and costly prescriptions.
“ The way I first used Seigel’s Syrup was this :
In the spring of 1883 I began to feel ill and out of
sorts. My tongue was dreadfully coated and a
thick phlegm covered my gums and teeth. After
eating I suffered from pain at the chest and
stomach. I had had nights, and sweat so much
that in the morning my underclothing was soaked
with moisture. I n the following August carbuncles
came on the hack .uy neck, on my nose, and on
my cheek-hone. What I suffered I cannot des-
cribe. I got so low and weak that I could barely
crawl about. The doctors did me no good. And
as for their physic I might as well have taken tea
or water. In pain and suffering I lingered on
until I heard, through a neighbour, of Mother
Scigel’s Curative Syrup and got a bottle from Mr.
W. Linsell, grocer, of Stehhing. A few doses
relieved me, and soon the carbuncles disappeared,
and I was as well as ever. Yours truly, (Signed)
Abram Thorogood, White House Farm, Steh-
bing, by Chelmsford, August 19th, 1892.”
In Mr. Thorogood’s own case the disease was
indigestion and dyspepsia, which poisoned his
blood and caused the carbuncles, which are
growths on the underlying layers of the skin,
After the Syrup had purified his blood they were
absorbed and expelled from the system. The
effect of the remedy in the cases of the other
members of his family shows (what we have often
stated), viz., that influenza attacks those whose
Wood is filled with the poisonous acids thrown into
the system by fermented food in the stomach. Mr.
Thorogood says his wife had been troubled with
indigestion and dyspepsia, which was no doubt
the case with the children also. Don’t allow your
blood to become a breeding-ground of disease.
On the first signs of Indigestion take Mother
.Seigel’s Curative Syrup. Vou know the proverb
about the ounce of prevention.
The English sisters of a Bulletin repre-
sentative are preserving two dingy, decomposed
sprays of flowers under a glass case. The treasures
in question were originally pitched at them by
their gracious Queen and Princess Beatrice during
a Battle of Flowers at Nice, and the misguided
young women (who are said—by themselves —to
have been singled out for these marks of royal
favor on account of their good looks), have just
forwarded a shred of rose-leaf to their relative in
Australia, hoping that the sacred relic will convert
him to “loyalty.”
A poor, crazy Englishwoman, with a history
of misfortune, comes constantly into a Sydney
bank, where she has no account, and on a credit-
form, or blank paper, scribbles her name and the
figures of a large sum of money. Then she calls
the teller and demands payment, and, when her
request is refused, upbraids the bank and its
officials. Another bank-crank is a Chinaman.
Periodically he comes to one Sydney bank and
draws a cheque for =6lOOO or £1,000,100. The
clerks give him some excuse, tell him he lias made
a mistake, or to call again. He goes off satisfied.
Dear Bulletin, — Apropos barter in Aus-
tralian bush townships, I visited many towns in
the “good days” in the now down-trodden occu-
pation of a “ book-fiend.” In each town it was
my custom to advertise largely, and I found the
custom pay, but in many cases I found a difficulty
in fixing upon the proper person to whom to make
payment. Here is an instance : At (in
N.S. Wales) on my first Saturday I was waited
upon by a gentleman from the local newspaper
office, who blandly presented me with a bill for
the one insertion already published. I explained
that my custom was to keep the advt. in while I
remained in the town and square up when leaving.
“Very glad to hear it, but the proprietor was
absent and wages, &c., had to be paid, &c., &c. ”
I paid. In half-an-hour another gentleman from
the same office called with a bill for the same
insertion. I expressed surprise and showed the
previous caller’s receipt. “Ah! ah ! beg pardon,
a mistake,” &c. A few minutes later another man
called with the same bill. Much riled, I roundly
charged the lot with being either lunatics or
swindlers. Gent No. 3 was then kind enough to
explain that the treasury was empty, the proprie-
tor’s pockets ditto, and each in the office “ had to
look out for himself.” The third collector was
the editor, who expressed his regret that the book-

A paper called the Melbourne Leader
has just discovered Phil May, and summarises his
career so : “After all sorts of ups and downs, and
plenty of globe-trotting in a figurative sense, suc-
cess was won on St. Stephen’s Review,’’ Practi-
cally, Phil May’s success was won in Australia.
His advances in his art after his arrival in Sydney
were speedy, and obvious even to the least critical
Bulletin readers. He attained his present excel-
lence before leaving Australia, and found his
market ready for him as soon as he chose to spread
himself in London. A carefully-selected store of
ignorance is essential in the respectable editor on
the Australian sup-press, but he has not always
sense enough to use his ignorance judiciously.
A Bulletin correspondent :—Auckland—
a city of saints, largely of Scotch origin, who won’t
let either trains or ’buses run on the Saw bath.
A howling desert of dull monotony set in the
midst of lovely scenery—no life, no gaiety, save
awful mockeries called “ high-class concerts ”
where Scotch people pay from 6d. to 18d. to hear
Scotch persons rasp out Scotch “music.” At
10 p. in. a funereal gloom settles down upon the
streets, deserted save for small bands of childish
nymphes du pave ranging from 10 to 15 years ; pro-
bably the predominating Scotch element among
the males has driven the older nymphs to other
cities for a living. No restaurants where one
can obtain a decent meal—not one. No hotels
where there is a first-class bar, such as you
would meet with even in a N.S.W. country town.
Some of us asked for vermouth, and at each place
the melancholy-looking barmaid didn’t know what
it was ; in one case the landlord was summoned,
and in a raucous Highland accent said, with a stern
manner, that there “ was nae ca’ for siccan leeker
in Auoklan’.” We went to an office to use a
telephone ; a tall young person in shirt-sleeves
and violent red-hair seized hold of the handle of
a machine like an old-fashioned ship’s pump, and
turned it with furious energy for seven minutes.
He told us to come in again and he would “get
on.” We got out. From 3to 5 Queen-street is
filled with women—some of them very pretty, but
all dressed badly, very badly. A good many
Maori half-caste women among them, often better-
looking and healthier than their pakeha sisters,
who affect to despise them. But, for all its dole-
fulness, there is not to be seen in Auckland the
same grim poverty one sees daily in Sydney—in
fact, the only things that go a-begging are fine
fish (kawai), three for 6d., and the aforesaid youth-
ful street-walkers.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Damuo’s second win in the G.N. Steeplechase
proves him a real good one, but the enthusiasts who
would place the new idol on a pedestal higher than Red-
leap’s are not reasoning mortals. Redleap ran the course
in practically the same time, with 21lh. more in the
saddle and heavier ground to travel, also Mr. Miller’s
great horse won quite as easily as did Daimio on Satur-
day. When the ex-hunter has carried 13st. 31b. to
victory on a sticky day, after annexing the big hurdle
race at the same meeting, he may then be fairly called
“another Red leap," but until then This Bulletin will
swear by its old champion.
♦ » * ♦
Sage Fred. Swindells, who “ didn’t care to see
his money joomping oop in the air," spoke from long
experience of other people's steeplechase disappoint-
ments. Baltoro, the Ballarat horse that couldn t fall,
managed to tumble early on Saturday, and his clever
rider, A. Williams, was seriously injured. For the sake
of argument, The Bulletin will assume that Baltoro
“ must have won ” if tire circumstance which caused his
downfall had happened to his co-favorite, Daimio,
instead. Anyway, the betting at the start gave some
excuse for this wild hypothesis. Of tile eignt leading
favorites three came to grief, whilst the remaining five
filled tlie first live places. None of the outside division
got a look-in at the finish.
* * * *
Although the Sydney gelding Dart ran a legiti-
mate second to Daimio there was nothing brilliant about
his performance, exc pb at the jumps. He was to have
darted past every tiling at the finish, if he stood up, but
the winner always held him safe,

It was refreshing to find The Admiral winning
a couple of races at the V.R.O. meeting. Cook’s old
Derby winner was a racehorse among a lot of commoners,
therefore a bit of extra weight didn’t stop him. Good
performances by good animals were what the public used
to look for in less dishonest days, and the fact that a
Derby hero surprised them by running up to form is a
sufficient explanation of tire turf’s decline. As regards
The Admiral, there have been teething troubles to
account for much of his inferior work. The horse is really
well now, and if lie he as gay and muscular in November
he will bid high for the Melb. Oup, and perhaps get the
stake knocked down to him. As a three-year-old he
finished sixth in Carbine’s race, when the going was iron
hard. As a five-year-old he narrovyly escaped getting “ a
place” behind Glenloth in the muddiest Oup ever con-
tested. There is a chance of the well-preserved ancient
distinguishing himself this year in any sort of weather.

Sylvan Prince, winner uf the Open Hurdle
Race, at Fleinington, comes of a stock that improves
greatly with age. The Prince will be worth following, his
friends say.

Not a single double book in Melb. has escaped

this will do more to clear Melbourne streets of perambu-
lating hookies than all the police interference.

Generally conceded that the Y.A.T.C. secre-
taryship, annually yielding £BOO to Harrie Smith, is
about the snuggest thing in Melb. billetdom. For bossing
the Y.R.C. employes Byron Moore only draws £7OO. As
another instance of the heavy cut in V.R.C. salaries,
Judge M‘Culloch’s slump from £3OO to £lO6 for 15 days’
work per year is notable.
Since the above was written Mr. Harrie Smith
has died. It seems fatal to a man to envy him. The
reason, perhaps, is that to envy a man it is necessary to
pay a certain amount of attention to his doings. To be
happy it is necessary to enquire very little and pay very
little attention to what goes on around you. Otherwise,
you will discover that this world is a mere slaughter-
house.

the St. Alban’s sweep.

TheY.R.C. insists that its secretary must be

A startled bookmaker points out in the Argus
that there are 400 bookmakers round Melb. each employ-
ing a clerk, and, should the totalisator be legalised, these
will be all thrown out of employment. The next com-

of crime is to lie deplored, creating as it does a falling-oil
in the constable industry.

Dear Bulletin,—You include Donald Wallace
in a list of owners whose luck deserted them after a Melb.
Cup win. Wallace’s boom didn’t set in until he had won
the Melb. Cup with Mentor. A week later he bought
Carbine with some of his Mentor money. And your list
omits the name of perhaps the unluckiest Cup-taker of
them all—Redfearn, who has had a bad time since
Malvolio’s year.—Yours, L.M.Q.

Tim Swiveller Davis, M.L.C., professes friend-
ship for the tote, and has promised to support it in the
Vic. Council, but says he is convinced that 'lie bill has no
chance of passing, “owing principally to the great influ-
ence of the Presbyterian Church.” The Presbyterian
Church is largely represented by fat little men, with
rings on their fingers and hooks to their noses.
Good old Mossy Isaacs, the genial Melbourne
bookie, who diligently lays the double and eschews bad
language, is very severe on Daviesian banks. Mossy, who
mostly speaks truth, although he is disposed to stretch it
a little, declares that £lO,OOO of his hard stuff has gone
down the Gentile sink since the Mercantile failed. “Talk
about bookmakers , ” says Mossy, with his eyes rolling
wildly, and Ids hat tilted back at an angle of 45°, “talk
about bookmakers— they're honorable men, they are,
although this with splendid scorn—“you don't see'em
elbowing their creditors at Government House balls.’’
Mossy is somewhat mollified when you remind him that
the bank-busters to a man are opponents of the tote.
* ♦ ♦ *
‘Old ’ Bradshaw (“Braddy’’) raves against
the tote in a Melb. sporting weekly. Braddy, judging
from his style, must be first cousin to a duke and uncle to
the British constitution. Hear him! “Of the moral
aspect of the totalisator I will say little ; but as this bill
at present stands it makes Communism in its worst form
the ruling spirit of the turf. It is Socialism carried to its
extreme—it places the man who expends thousands to
produce a Carbine or a Commotion on exactly the same
level as the three-card man, and inculcates the immor-
ality which sways the latter. This bill would, indeed,
leiel down and make true the fallacious adage that on the
turt and under it all men are equal.” Evidently a great
believer in caste and “blood” is Braddy. Let arts and
commerce, laws and learning go, but leave him still his
noble Ikey Mo.

™ Tl i ree J? mall swee P-men were fined £1 a-pieee at
Charters Towers recently, and ordered to enter into £lOO
recognizances to run no more sweeps. Judge Noel said
sweeps were clearly illegal; and the defence asked why.
in that case Q. Govt, didn’t prosecute “Tattersall”
instead of picking out the small marks ; and proceeded Jo
make nasty comments on the attendance at sw'eep
banquets of Q. Postmaster-General and other notables.
If the Judge is right, of which there seems no doubt,
there was no need for the Govt, to bring in an elaborate
Anti-Gambling Bill to make fish of sweep-promoters and
fowl of church-bazaar swindlers. The Bill promises to
pass, anyway ; and where then will George A. flee to?
Not to Maonland where the House of Representatives
has just summarily thrown out a sweep - legalising
measure. New Caledonia, perhaps ? The Bulletin told
mm to go there over a year ago.

Unpleasant stories are told in Melbourne about
direct money bribes given by local bookmakers to M.’sP.

Several members, it is averred, confess that they have

Australian professional rowing is dead. The
regatta glories of the past 1 In ’72 Balmain Regatta blub
offered £5OO for an interprovinoial four-oared race, and
negotiated with England and America with a view to
having an international fours race in ’73, guaranteeing
£2OO worth of trophies and £5OO to each crew from those
foreign parts tor expenses. Now 1! ! In ’74 the Clarence
Riverites gave £355 in cash for prizes at their annual
regatta on Queen's Birthday. There was no entrance-fee
for the Champion Out-rigger Race of £2OO, and it was
won by Mick Rush, with Ned Trickett second.

The English bowler of this season is Pougher,
the Leicestershire man. Pougher visited Australia with
the last Shaw-Shrewsbury team, which ran in opposition
to Walter Read’s Eleven (brought out by the M.G.C.) and
had such a bad financial time.

With the beginning of the really cold
weather in Melbourne it is strange to see the lead-
ing drapery houses sacrificing their winter goods
to make room for an early show of Spring fashions.
Such is the case, however; and it is marvellous
this winter to note the extreme manner in which
the prices of articles which one would have
thought would just be in the greatest demand-
such as furs, sealskin jackets, winter mantles,
dress stuffs, &c.—are reduced at Messrs. Hicks,
Atkinson & Sons’ establishment in Collins-street,
during their existing stock-taking sale.*
One of the handsomest colts of the season
appeared at the late Caulfield meeting. This was
Prentham, by Trenton out of Nellie Moore. He is
a good bay, of average height, but wonderfully
strong and well put together. Nellie has never
thrown a bad one, and Lochiel, Corunna, Gulloden
and Steadfast have testified to her capabilities as
a stud matron. More than one good judge re-
marked of Trentham, “ he’s a regular Derby
horse and he will be a lucky man who gets him
in'the St. Alban’s distribution.*
Bernard's Fine Art Gallery, at 430 George-
street, Sydney, contains just now an unusually
fine collection of works of art, and all connoisseurs,
as well as that much larger class of persons who
are not connoisseurs but desire to look as if they
were, will find this establishment well worth a
visit. A particularly fine collection of water
color views is now to be seen at One
specially beautiful work is a view of Lake, Ala-
baster (Canterbury, M.L.I, and, among a large
number of others, almost equally charming, are
a view of Shoreham (England), a moonlight
English landscape, a picture of an old English
church in Sussex, and many more which cannot
be particularised.*

Bravo Jones and Mr. “ Seppy ” Stephen were
conspicuous figures in the club-stand and enclosure at
Epsom Derby meeting. I suppose, writes Tub Bulletin’s
correspondent, they got there owing to their connection
with the V. R.C. and A.J.O. Stephen, who followed Jones
In backing Sir Visto, but in a small way, is industriously
booming the starting-machine, which is to have a trial at
tandown. Mountmorganaire D’Arcy had bis usual big
party in his private stand at the Derby. He is most
iberal in his invitations to Australians, and most men of
iny note “ down under ” may be found partaking of his
hvish hospitality on Derby and Oak days.
‘** * ♦
“ Bravo,” or “lucky ” Jones, as they call him
In E igland, won over £2OOO on Sir Visto in the Derby. ■
He backed the horse both for win and place on his own
Judgment, as he thought he was the best-looking of a
very bad lot. Of course, writes The Bulletin’s corres-
pondent, the books have only lent the money for a few
days, as “ Bnvo” plunges, and they are bound to get it
back. Jo > Thompson had to pay him a bit.
A familiar sight at any suburban race-meeting
just now is the min leaning against the fence working
out deep and mysterious calculations on his “ card.” He
is the system-bettor, and is figuring how ranch he’ll need
to pul on Bullswool for the next race in order to get back
the £1 he lost on Nostril for the previous one, and also
the £5 he ought to have won on the aforesaid Nostril. If
Bullswool loses you’ll see him, after the race, figuring out
what amount he will require to back Flyblow' to win him
back the £2 he has lost, and also the £lO he expected to win
over the two previous races. And so on through the day.
Of course when he does back a winner he is safe ; but few
men have a pocket long enough and a will strong enough
to keep going against a run of bad luck.

The number of jockeys killed on the flat in Aus-
tralia during the past season is appalling. At the present
rate of going, the old-time gladiator or toreador had “ a
woman’s billet ” as compared to the modern jockey.

Mr. W. Pridham, a Vic. racing enthusiast, says
that the majority of Vic. horse-owners belong to a class
who should not owm racehorses. The totalisalor wmuld,
he says, if introduced, wipe them out in one act. That is
the best answer to the loud squawk of the owners who
live on the game.

Private “totes” still flourish in Melb. suburbs.
At one shop, the other Saturday, 4000 shillings were
invested on a small meeting.
* * ♦ ♦
“ Bookmaker ” writes in a Melb. paper on his
trade, and, being of very long experience, both in Eng-
land and Australia, doubtless many can spot him. Except
in a couple of good years, he has never been worth more
than £2OOO, though occupying an esteemed position. He
argues, in short, that bookmaking is the spider-wheel
buggy-trade that the punters and preachers believe it to
be. There is some confusion, however, between makings
and keepings.

A St. Arnaud man sues for damages from the
local race-club for a broken-leg mishap to his son while
riding at a recent meeting. Plaintiff bases his claim on
the alleged bad state of the course. If he succeeds, many
clubs will have to put their courses in order or go out of
the business.
N.S.W. postal revenue last year is estimated
as having lost £lO,OOO through the interdiction of Tatter-
sail’s sweep. Yet Queensland is going to face the music.

Scene : Melbourne suburban racecourse. Female
trainer, two boys, and two ponies. The boy mounting.
Female trainer ( loq .): “ Take him round twice at a sharp
canter and sweat that gut off him.” The New Woman.
* * * *
In Victoria, now, the New Woman owns, trains
and backs—and gets put off the track just like a man. It
is quite on the cards that she will yet steer her own
neddies, as men are deceitful creatures.
* * * »
As with monkeys, babies and green peas,
Chinamen are all alike. Lottery-keepers seldom pay
fines, but ask for time. When time is up, another Chow
walks up to gaol, “does his bit,” and draws a few pounds
when he comes out. The Law is satisfied, and the police
wink the other eye.

“Pastor George Soltau (the Tas. earthquake-
man?) at Gore, Maoriland: “I do not know of this
colony, but I do know of the Australian colonies, that
they worship a god of leather, the Football, and a smaller
god of leather, the Cricket-ball ; and when 2000 men go
to see Carbine off to England, and you can’t get 200 men
to a prayer-meeting, no wonder God has smitten Victoria
with a depression such as that colony, has been experi-
encing.”
• * * •
One argument urged against the tote is that a
trainer cannot back his horse for any amount—that as
soon as he puts a few pounds on the public rush and spoil
his price. Yet owners and trainers aver that the
“ books” have so combined as to make it almost impos-
sible to get a fair price about anything. So many runners
and telegraphists are employed by them that the instant
a horse is genuinely backed in the right quarter every
penciller within a quarter-mile radius knows it; and down
go the odds.
♦ * ♦ ♦
It is calculated that cyclist Zimmerman, in a
red-hot go, maintains for 2min. a speed requiring the
expenditure of energy representing two-thirds of 1 h.p.,
while for 6sec., it is alleged, he has exerted the remark-
able force of l| h.p. in driving his bike. This feat is con-
sidered equal to raising a 1881 b. weight Iyd. high in Isec.,
yet in ordinary riding over a specified distance a cyclist
would not labor a quarter as much as a runner.

Young George Martin, son of N.S.W.’s late
Chief-Justice, is distinguishing himself as an oarsman at
Oxford, writes a Bulletin correspondent from England.
For years his college, St. John’s, has been trying in vain
to work up towards the “head of the river,” but until
this year have always stuck behind Christ Church. This
season young Marlin his gone to the stroke thwart, with
the result that John’s has gone up four places and now
Stands sixth. The cornstalk pulls a very good oar, and it
is predicted that he will, in all probability, be tried for
the ’Varsity eight at biw, with a good chance of his Blue,
Pioreat Australia !

Marvellous W. G. Grace (writes The Bulle-
tin’s correspondent) has just scored his 1000 runs in first-
class matches within a month of the opening of the
season. For years he has not batted in such form as the
following record will show: —
Runs.
At Lord’s, M. 0.0. v. Sussex (13 and 103) .. 116
At Lord’s, M.C.C. v. Yorkshire (18 and 25) .. 43
At Bristol, Gloucester v. Somerset .. 288
At Cambridge, A. J. VVebbe’s Eleven v. Cam-
bridge University 52
At Gravesend, Gloucester v. Kent (257 and 73
not out) 380
At the Oval, England v. Surrey 18
At Lord’s, Gloucester v. Middlesex .. .. 169
Total for nine innings 1016
He is quite the hero of the hour, and crow'ds follow him,
cheering as they did his performances of 30 years ago.
The W. W. Read benefit (writes The Bulle-
tin’s London correspondent) was a frost. They expected
large gates, but owing to the miserable show made by
Surrey in the first innings (did the pros, play badly on
purpose?)public interest did not rise to the occasion, and
a few hundreds only resulted. It is time that bastard
amateurism should be knocked on the head. Read has
been for years supposed to be an auctioneer, but he has in
reality been a paid professional for the Surrey County
under the guise of “ Assistant Secretary ” —though he has
hardly ever done work in that capacity.

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both .in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,

this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 18711 was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Sir,
Wil{ you please publish, at my expense, the
following correspondence for the benefit of
theatrical managers, and touring professionals. I
recently signed a contract to Blight, manager of
the Bill Posting Advertising 00., of Ballarat,
for the posting of 20 three-sheet lithograph
posters, for the sum of £2 10s. per week for one
week or more. The contract remained in force
four weeks. But, as I had only 12 posters with
me, I wanted to pay for one week only, and the
following experience and correspondence speaks
for itself.
Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir, —I have received your letter with
summons enclosed. will obey your instructions
and attend court, but it is very difficult to do any-
thing without your being present as a witness to
give evidence; and I greatly fear unless you come
to Ballarat for the Tuesday there will be a verdict
given against you. Ido not think the parties are
entitled to the money claimed, but it depends on
the evidence given by you, and it is a pity if you
cannot come. If you do not come, I will let you
know result by letter on Tuesday.
I am, yours truly,

Professor Richards,

Dear Sir, —There was an order made this morn-
ing against you for .£6 6s. Mr. Blight in the box
swore that there was no number of posters men-
tioned when the contract was made between you
and him, and that all the hoardings he had avail-
able for posters was 12. He swore there was no
agreement to charge you anything less than the
£2 10s. a week on account of his having 12 posters
to exhibit. On that evidence the Court found for
him for .£5 and £1 6s. costs, making £6 6s. in all,
which with £1 Is., my costs, makes £7 75., less
£5, which you paid me the other day, leaving
£2 75,, which kindly forward. Prior to the hear-
ts' I paid .£3 2s. 6d. into court, so as to protect
you in the event of Mr. Blight admitting that
there were only 12 posters to be paid for.
I am, yours truly,
F. H. TUTHILL.
Lydiard Street,
Ballarat, 9th J uly, 1895.
Professor Richard,

Dear Sir, —Blight and others v. You. As I
feared, an order was made against you this morn-
ing for £6 65., being .£5 debt and £1 6s. costs.
Mr. Blight went into the box and proved that
you signed the contract, and that the posters were
duly exhibited for the month, and as I could give
no evidence to the contrary, the court made an
order against you for the above amount. I have
got a stay of execution until Thursday, to allow
time for me to write to you and get a reply with
the money. Kindly forward me the £6 65., and
£1 Is. for my costs, by return post.
It was a great pity you could not have attended
the court, because your evidence would, I think,
have gained you the verdict.
Yours truly,
F. H. TUTHILL.

TO THE ELECTORS OF THE KING
DIVISION OF SYDNEY.
Gentlemen,
More than 40 years ago the undivided city of
Sydney, of which you now form so important a
part, opened the door for my entrance into Par-
liamentary life by electing me by a majority of
two to one to the seat just vacated by Mr. Went-
worth, the author of our Constitution. Events
were then rapidly giving life and form to liberal
thought and opinion, and the dawn of freedom
was shedding its first invigorating light upon the
land. Throughout the long period which has since
elapsed, I have labored side by side with many of
the best men who ever sat in Parliament for the
enactment of sound laws and the honest adminis-
tration of Government. If my many Acts were
withdrawn from it, the very Statute Book of to-
day would present a barren record.
To all who know me, and to all fair-minded
men, it may be well understood that I am not a
seeker of a seat in Parliament. I could easily
have obtained that object from my late con-
stituents. But a momentous crisis in the history
of our country has arisen, when a knot of unscrupu-
lous men, by arts and artifices that would ill bear
examination, have obtained possession of the
offices of State, and are bent upon securing their
own personal ends, even by carrying disaster and
ruin into the industrial pursuits and productive
interests of all classes of the population. On the
invitation of a large body of your fellow electors,
I have consented to enter into the contest for your
suffrages as a direct and determined opponent of
the Prime Minister. By his advice to the Lieu-
tenant-Governor, Mr. Reid has brought about
what was described by himself in the Legislative
Assembly as a “penal dissolution.” He had a
large working majority, which would have satis-
fied the greatest English Minister. But Mr.
Reid, like most small-witted men, is fond of new
projects and new methods, without the power of
brain to discern their fitness or unfitness, their
wisdom or unwisdom. Having wantonly em-
broiled himself with the Upper Chamber, he has,
at the bidding of the Daily Telegkaph, dissolved
Parliament, by which he is certain to banish
many of his pliant followers from the Assembly,
but by which he cannot bring a feather’s
weight to bear upon the Council. It is the mere
childish menace of a feeble boaster. But has not
Mr. Reid to thank.his own arrogance and his own
abusive tongue, and his notorious incapacity to
wisely frame his measures, for most of his troubles
with the Legislative Council ? Forgetting what
is due to the great office lie holds, he began his
conciliatory course by describing the members of
the Council afcujiore reckless slaughterers than
any to be found at the Abattoirs; he next held
them up as mummies, only fit to be stowed away
the museum'; then he spoke of them as men of
sinister eyes and bull necks (not keeping in view
his own symmetrical proportions); and finally, at
the last sitting of Parliament, he called upon some
imaginary power to “sweep the old fossils ’’away.
Did ever Prime Minister before speak of his equals
in this sort of language?
I now beg of you to examine Mr. Reid’s legisla-
tive measures. His Local Government Bill was
so crude and ill-drawn, and so wanting in provi-
sions to meet the wants of the people, that it is
fortunate that he himself laid it aside in the
Assembly. But that Bill never reached the
Upper House ; it was killed by the extreme men
of the Labor-party—Mr. Reid’s present allies.
You will next look at the Land and Income-tax
Assessment Bill. That measure contained exemp-
tions from the operation of the proposed tax of all
incomes of <£3oo downwards, which was nothing
short of an unblushing attempt to bribe the
members of the Assembly. The Council is denied
the right of amending a taxation bill, and the
members of that body had to choose between
giving their sanction to an iniquitous proposal and
rejecting the measure. An intelligent examina-
tion of the defective character of Mr. Reid’s
other bills as sent to the Legislative Council, will
disclose grounds of objection similar to those I
have pointed out. But I invite your attention to
Mr. Reid’s plan of reforming the Upper House.
It is a notable thing that the bogus democrats who
have floated to the surface shrink from trusting
the creation of the Upper House to the votes of
the true democracy. But Mr. Reid’s plan is,
beyond example, the silliest ever submitted to an j
intelligent people, and if it were possible for it to i
be carried into effect, no man of self-respect and
independence would accept a seat in a House so
formed; it would be debased to a Chamber of
Flunkeys, and would soon become the corrupt
instrument of any profligate Minister of the day.
When seeking election 12 months ago, Mr. Reid
made all manner of wild promises. He would im-
mediately abolish the Dibbs tariff and bring in
freetrade. Has he done it ? He would manage
things so well that, within a month, there would
be no “unemployed ”in the country. Have they
not increased_ by thousands? Has he redeemed
any one of his boastful promises? On the con-
trary, has he not sent starving men into the public
parks to work for their food without wages ? Has
not his criminal ignorance and folly paralysed
every branch of trade and industry, and brought
ruin upon countless families ?
In asking you to elect me as your representa-
tive, I desire to state clearly and boldly what, in
my judgment, is the work which Parliament ought
to be immediately invited to do. In view of the
early federation of the colonies, nothing whatever
ought to be done, which would create obstacles to
Union. After the Colonies become united and
occupy the status of a nation, no provincial Cus-
toms’ tariff can possibly exist. The very act of
union will lodge the sole power of imposing Cus-
toms duties in the Federal Parliament. There-
fore, as I have often stated in public, no man can
be a sincere advocate of Federation and, at the
same time, a champion of provincial tariffs. The
two positions are absolutely irreconcilable. But
Federation would open all the markets of wide
Australia to all Australian producers and manu-
facturers, without let or hindrance. All men of
patriotic spirit will unite, irrespective of differ-
ences of opinion on smaller questions, to hasten
the advent of Australian Union. Then will come
the _ great struggle for the settlement of the
National Tariff, when men can take sides accord-
ing to their convictions in the election of the
Federal Parliament.
But the cause of Federation does not stand in
the way of advancing the interests of New South
Wales as a separate colony or state. Undoubtedly
one of the measures moat urgently wanted is a
comprehensive and carefully-framed bill to confer
upon the country districts the blessings of Local
Self-government. Such a bill was introduced by j
me in 1891, and was lost largely through the
machinations of Mr. Reid, who joined the Pro- I
teotionist Opposition of the day to destroy it.
Any such bill must provide for a liberal endow-
ment to the self-governing bodies, with ample
powers of taxation for local improvements. In
my judgment, if we inaugurated a wise policy of
improving our inland navigable waters, our coastal
harbors, and of enhancing the value of the public
estate by irrigation works, the preservation of
the rain-fall, and by carrying out cheap cross-
country railways, fields of reproductive labor
could be opened which would absorb every able-
bodied man now out of employment, while our
national assets would be largely increased in
value.
These are some of the questions which ought to
engage the attention of Parliament, instead of
wasting time by tinkering with impossible provin-
cial tariffs which cannot feed hungry men and
women, or serve the national cause of Australia.
I remain, Gentlemen, your faithful servant,
HENRY PARKES.

Mr. W. Jennings, Adelaide, S. A., formerly
of Hawthorn, near Melbourne,
“For the pasts or 4 years, I have been a
?reat sufferer from rheumatism and piles,
tried all sorts of medicines, hut derived
no good from them. I chanced to read one
of your books and thought I would give
your Sarsaparilla a trial. I did so, and after
taking one bottle I felt better, and after
taking 4 bottles I was a new man. I was
sorry I never took it before, for it would
have saved me very much pain. ”

One of the best races
ever run in Australia was
the Canterbury Plate at
Elemington in November,
1886. There were four
starters, Trident, Trenton,
Cyclops, and Tamarisk, the
latter of whom went to
make the pace for Trident.
This she did for a mile, when
Trenton and Trident singled
themselves out and ran a
most desperate race to the
post, Trident just winning
nt the last. Although Alec.
Robertson, who was on
Trenton, had out him up,
he remarked to a by-
stander, “ He’s the best and
gamest horse I ever rode,
and I was more done than
him at the finish.” The
time was omin. 25fsecs.,
which was the record for
years. Trenton, 5 years,
9st. 61b. ; Trident, 3 years,
7st. 31b. Trenton at the
same meeting, carrying 9st.
51b., ran Arsenal to a neck

A Maoriland man was drowned recently,
in a lake where the maximum depth was under
5ft., through the capsizing of his canoe. It never
occurred to him that the bottom was within easy
walking distance, so he swam until he became
exhausted, and then he went down horizontally,
and died on his stomach on the sand with just 48
inches of water above him.

A London newspaper-vendor says that
during the Wilde trials he sold twice as many
evening papers to women as to men. The idea of
woman’s “native modesty ” is by this time pretty
well exploded. Women are no more modest than
men—perhaps not so much so. But they sham
modesty better and oftener than men, because
m m expect it from them, and heredity and social
conventions make the pleasing of men their first
object in life.
The sale of old Bulletins at Melbourne
wharves, and other parts of that swindlers’ para-
dise, seems to have inspired a new reading of the
law by policemen on the spot. A victimised pur-
chaser of an old Bulletin is informed that he
can’t give the fraudulent newsboy into custody
unless he can produce witnesses to prove that he
specially asked for “this week’s Bulletin,”
which, of course, the victim can’t do, inasmuch as
he took the date, of the paper for granted, and had
no witnesses to the transaction, anyway. More-
over, the boys have been educated in the police
doctrine as to what constitutes felony in news-
paper dealing, therefore a customer who mentions
“this week’s Bulletin” is supplied with it,
whilst the customer who merely says “ Give me a
Bulletin,’’ gets an old copy shoved into him, and
has no redress. That is to say, the police stand
by and smile upon the swindle.

Marshall’s Mate .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You almost heard the surface bake, and saw
the gum-leaves turn—
You could have watched the grass scorch
brown had there been grass to burn.
In such a drought the strongest heart might
well grow faint and weak—
’T would frighten Satan back to—well—-not
far from Dingo Creek.
The tanks went dry on Ninety Mile, as
tanks go dry out-back,
The Half Way Spring had failed at last when
Marshall missed the track ;
Beneath a dead tree on the plain we saw a
packhorse reel—
Too blind to see there was no shade, and too
done-up to feel.
And charcoaled on the canvas bag (’twas
written pretty clear)
We read the message Marshall wrote. It
said, ‘ ‘ I’m taken queer—
I’m somewhere off of Headman’s track, half
blind and nearly dead ;
Find Crowbar, get him sobered up, and
follow back,” it said.
“ Let Mitchell go to Bandicoot. You’ll find
him there,” said Mack.
“ I’ll start the chaps from Starving Steers,
and take the dry-holes back.”
We tramped till dark and tried to track the
pack-horse on the sands,
And just at daylight Crowbar came with
Milroy’s station hands.
“ Spread out as widely as you can each side
the track,” said he ;
“ The first to find him make a smoke that
all the rest can see.”
We took the track and followed back where
Crowbar follow’d fate,
We found a dead man in the scrub —but
’twas not Crowbar’s mate.
The station-hands from Starving Steers were
searching all the week—
But never news of Marshall’s fate came back
to Dingo Creek ;
And no one save the Spirit of the Sand-
waste, fierce and lone,
Knows where Jack Marshall crawled to die—
hit Crowbar might have known.
He’d scarcely closed his quiet eyes or drawn
a sleeping breath—
They say that Crowbar slept no more until
he slept in death.
A careless, roving scamp, that loved to laugh
and drink and joke,
But no man saw him smile again (and no one
saw him smoke),
And, when we spelled at night, he’d lie with
eyes still open wide
And watch the stars as if they’d point the
place where Marshall died.
The search was made as searches are (and
often made in vain),
And on the seventh day we saw a smoke
across the plain ;
We left the track and followed back—’twas
Crowbar still that led, ■ -
And when his horse gave out at last he
walked and ran ahead.
We reached the place and turned again—
dragged back and no man spoke— :
It was a bush-fire in the scrubs that made
the cursed smoke.
And when we gave it best at last, he said
a Til see it through,”
Although he knew we’d done as much as
mortal men could do.
“By God, I won’t give up !” he said—his
hand pressed to his brow— .
“ The cursed flies and ants and things, they
might be at him now.
Good-bye, boys ; tell the folks I’ve gone to
find my mate,” he said,
‘ ‘ I’m going back to find him, and I will—
alive or dead !”
He packed his horse with water and provi-
sions for a week,
And then, at sunset, crossed the plain, away
from Dingo Creek.
We watched him tramp beside the horse till
we, as it grew late,
Could not tell which was Bonypart, and
which was Marshall’s mate.
The dam went dry at Dingo Creek and we
were driven back,
And none dared face the Ninety Mile when
Crowbar took the track.
They saw him at “Dead Camel” and up the
Dry Hole Creeks—
There came a day when none had heard of
Marshall’s mate for weeks ;
They’d seen him at No Sunday, he called at
Starving Steers —
There came a time when none had heard of
Marshall’s mate for years.
They found old Bonypart at last, picked
clean by hungry crows,
But how his master died none knew—the
soul of Marshall knows !
And now, way out on Dingo Creek, when
winter days are late,
The bushmen talk of Crowbar’s ghost
“ what’s looking for his mate
For let the cynics scoff and sneer, and let
the wise men doubt—
The soul of Crowbar and his mate have
travelled further out.
Beyond the. furthest two-rail fence, Oolanne
and Nevertire—
Beyond - the furthest rabbit-proof, barbed
wire and common wire—
Beyond the furthest “ Gov’ment ” tank, and
past the furthest bore—
The Never Never, No Man’s Land, No-
more and Nevermore—
Beyond the Land o’ Break-o’-Day, and sun-
set and the dawn,
The soul of Marshall and the soul of Mar-
shall’s mate have gone.

America still leads. In Kansas a man has
been tried and convicted for hypnotising another
in order to make him commit a murder. The
actual slayer was, tried and acquitted, and now
the hypnotic murderer has been sentenced to bd
hanged. The sentence has been confirmed by the
Supreme Court.
Emanuel Baptist Church, San Francisco,
has a bad record. Oneofitspastorssuicided, another
was a murderer —he committed the unpardonable
crime of shooting an editor. Now two young
girls have been outraged and strangled in the
precincts which it would be grotesque mockery to
call sacred. On Saturday, April 13, some ladies
entered the church to decorate it for Easter.
They found in a small room off the library the
body of Marian Williams, aged 18, stiff and cold.
The church was searched, and on the following
day, Easter Sunday, while the bells of the
city were jangling a joyous hymn for the
risen Christ, the nude body of Blanche Lamont,
a young school-teacher, was found high up in the
belfry tower of Emmanuel Church. Suspicion
points to the church librarian and Sunday-school
superintendent, Theodore Durrant, the last person
seen with both the dead girls. Durrant is a
medical student; and it is said that he was a
sexual pervert, and had been brooding over a
medical work on abnormal sexual crimes, and that
he had made improper proposals to other girls
whom he had endeavored to inveigle into the
church (of which he had a key) on various pre-
texts. Durrant was also met in a suspicious
state of undress and excitement in or
near the church about the time when the
crimes were committed; and the case against
him, though wholly circumstantial, seems strong.
A cruel commentary upon the facts comes as
a petition from the city publicans, against
whom the churches not long ago led a crusade.
The churches wanted the private doors of public-
houses closed, and liquor-licenses to be issued only
to parsons vouched for by twelve citizens. The
publicans now ask that private doors in churches
be closed ; that no separate rooms, bedrooms, or
lounges be permitted in churches; and that no
preacher be licensed except on the recommenda-
tion of twelve citizens. “This petition,” it is
said, “is not conceived in a spirit of malice, but
with the highest and loftiest and most honorable
object of saving the young girls of San Francisco
from murderers, and preventing the debasement
of churches as houses of ill-fame.” The satire is
keen and just. For, as says the Akgonaut, which
heads its article on the subject :
There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Emmanuel’s veins—
“ there is no further field for Emmanuel Baptist
Church as a temple of the Most High. Whatever
may be the fate of Durrant, Durrant ? s church
should die.”
Old Mrs. Spurling, of Auburn (Vic.),
stumbled and broke her arm the other day. She
died of the shook a week aftetwards—at the age
of 104. It was her boast that she had held in, her
hand the acorn from which'grew the finest oak-
tree in Victoria.
S. Australia is losing the Queensland trade
owing to the indiscriminate collection of the
stock-tax in the former province. Formerly, sup-
plies for North and N.W. Queensland were largely
drawn from South Australia, wool being sent in
exchange. Now, the Longreach and Charleville
teamsters are scooping in the trade. Teamsters
with Queensland wool to Horgott (S.A.) have
been worried for the tax on working(!)bullocks, and
only allowed to load for the back journey on con-
dition they return in six months —tax guaranteed.
The Melbourne city market, which the
Municipal Council built, with .£250,000 of bor-
rowed money, on the yielding sand of the Yarra
bank, is sinking in various directions. Part of the
building has moved several inches from its original
location, and the rest is cracking and bursting
asunder. It is an enormous pile, erected in the
boom days, when money was splashed around like
water. No one really wanted the market, or had
any use for it, so it has never even paid interest
on its cost. Now it would seem that the famous
white elephant is bogged, and .£250,000 is going
down to the corpse-fed crab and the ghoul-like
Yarra eel.
A lugubrious letter from a Queensland
paper:—
1 wish no harm to anyone, but we want the dry seasons
back again. What we had to sell then we got some-
thing for, now we get nothing. Just fancy butter at Id.
per lb., and maize at lOd. per bushel! How are we to
live on it? Your Forest Hill correspondent quoted an
instance in his last where a neighbor sent tw o tons of
potatoes to Brisbane and got 6d. in return, and lost his
bags into the bargain. Well, 1 sent five tons of really
good potatoes to Brisbane last season, and got back
17s. fid., and I also lost my bags, which cost me £l, so
after all I was 2s. 7d. to the bad, with all my labor lost.
And this is how we live and are expected to pay our way.

The Odontological Society of Vic. was
registered the other week under humorous cir-
cumstances connected with the civil war in Mel-
bourne’s little world of dentistry. Ever since
E. L. Oldfield started his dental college and
hospital, a number of furious rivals have been
trying to scuttle his membership in certain useless,
decrepit institutions which a representative tooth-
doctor is expected to belong to. It seems that an
odontological society existed in Melbourne for 10
years. There was no tangible idea in the thing,
except “ prestige,” and it had dwindled down to
a body of 13 financial members (including Old-
field), when he found that it was making secret
arrangements to go bung and form itself anew,
without including him in the reconstructed- con-
cern. Thereupon, Oldfield lured a “ high official”
into an official admission that the society was
defunct, and immediately called a meeting of
friendly dentists to form the O.S. of Vic. as afore-
said. A day later, when the dead society recon-
structed and tried to register as an 0.5., Limited,
they found that their title had been appropri-
ated by Oldfield for his new-born institution.
Then the corpse of the old society arose from its
winding-up sheet and swore that it hadn’t died at
all, and passed a cold, clammy resolution to the
effect that E. L. Oldfield ought to be expelled
front its decomposing remains.

A Case by the Way.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The road from Dargo to Ghost Creek is one of
the worst in Victoria. It twines through heavily-
timbered country, and is so narrow that the coach
passengers can touch the branches of ti-tree and
dog-wood on each side as they drive along.
1 was sitting on the box-seat, and dreamily
watching the narrow pathway twisting itself like
a long grey boa-constrictor into numerous S’s on
ahead. The driver’s skill was admirable, and our
four horses were the most sagacious beasts that ever
wore harness. One minute the near wheels would
take the bark off a gum-tree to avoid a deep rut,
and the next minute the off wheels would plunge
boldly into a deep rut to avoid steeplechasing over
a fallen log.
“What would be done if two vehicles met on
the road ? ” I asked.
“Traps never do meet on this road,” the driver
answered sententiously.
He was a silent man, and seemed to consider
further expression of opinion needless. Suddenly
two dark spectres showed up in the distance.
“Man ridiu’ and leadin’ a pack-horse,” said the
driver. I was deeply interested.
We stopped, and the man and horses came up
beside us. It was not a pack-horse, but a great,
queerly-eolored saddle-horse that would have
adorned a circus.
The man peered into the coach-windows and
then addressed the driver, who was leisurely
fixing his whip lash.
“ Look here, have you got that young woman
wot’s bin nursin’ Jim MTutyre on board?”
This startled me. I was the young woman who
had nursed Jim MTntyre. The coach-driver
jerked his thumb at me.
“Kin yer ride a saddle-horse?” inquired the
new-comer.
I had kept my seat on the coach, and, after that,
I felt I could ride anything. The man eyed me
all over, and then said :
“ There’s a female took very bad suddink-like.
She heard about you last week, and now she’s
set on having you come and cure her.”
Jim MTntyre had died, so why the “female”
had faith in me, I did not know ; but, after some
further talk, I agreed to break my journey.
The coach-driver remarked : “If yer jine me
somewhere about here next trip, yer can ride out
yer passidge-money.”
He could not leave his horses, but he issued
large orders to the other man as to the best means
of hoisting me on to the roan creature’s back. I
draped my skirts as decently as circumstances
permitted. The man’s saddle was an awkward
thing to balance one’s-self on. The coach trundled
off down the winding road ; I jogged along un-
comfortably after it; and, as it finally disappeared,
I felt as if I had lost a friend. The bearded man
beside me proved to be even more taciturn than
the coach-driver. The only remark he made to
me during the three-mile ride was :
“ Wouldn’t it be better if yer straddled him?”
I privately thought it would; but modestly re-
frained.
• * *
I found that the “ female ” owned a roadside
hotel; her only son helping in the management.
She was a queer-looking woman, evidently suffer-
ing from a chronic complaint. I did what I could
to relieve her pain, and it was dark before I
finished my labors. The red-headed son came
into the room at intervals. He did not trouble to
knock, and seemed uncommonly interested in all
my proceedings. I was embarrassed ; but he and
his mother were not.
He suggested some tea for me, and said “Wot’ll
yer take ?”
“ Oh, anything !” I said.
He brought in several bottles of spirits, and
ranged them on the low mantelshelf; also some
ale, porter, and raspberry-vinegar. I begged for
some tea, and watched the son make it for me.
He made it in a jug, and .poured it into a tin
mug through the strainer of a soap-dish. I took
it with a thankful heart, and refused the stimu-
lants, but they were left on the shelf all night,
It was a night to be remembered. About nine
o’clock the population of the neighborhood in-
creased, and there were sounds of revelry in the
bar.
I was very tired* and lay down on the bed
beside my patient, turning the lamp low. The
woman’s pain had eased by this time, and she
was inclined to be talkative. The walls were
covered with newspapers, and in a little while the
newspapers were covered with perambulating
illustrations. Cockroaches, and beetles, and
spiders, and great, long, straw-colored things,
walked round about each other and made little
clicks against the paper. Mosquitos and flies
filled the room with a buzzing sound, and then I
felt sundry nips and bites which seemed beyond
the power even of Australian mosquitos. I turned
up the lamp. There were specimens of the
insect world on the bedclothes. They were very
lively. Some of them took exercise in erratic
jumps one after the other ; some preferred short
sprints on the flat. The latter looked as if they
were not built for the hurdles.
“I heard tell a lot of you while young MTntyre
was bad,” said my patient.
“Yes!” said I abstractedly, as I captured a
large, flat, black insect and put it in a watery
fl r S,Y e * , , , , , , ,
The noises on the verandah waxed louder, and
I looked at my patient wearily. I felt there was
little chance of sleep for her while she was worried
by such sounds.
Suddenly above the din a voice said, in tones
of bibulous determination—“ Fll shout for the
crowd I”
My patient opened her eyes and murmured
softly, “ Ned’s havin’ a grand night, thank God !”
Then it dawned on me that loud voices in a bar-
room might have a soothing effect on the licensee,
* * •
Daylight dawned, and the red-headed boy
] oo med into the room. He offered to “draw a
cork ” for me ; but I felt that nothing but chain-
pagne W ould suit my depressed condition, and
tbey bad none .
T be boy and Davis (the man who escorted me
f rom t be coach) spent most of the day asleep, and
j rummaged round for eatables, and fed on salt
mea t a nd badly-made bread.
There was an old nanny-goat, with a natural
] ong j ng to be milked; but milking is not an
accomplishment of mine, though I might have
done something with a breast-pump had nanny
submitted. Yet I was yearning for milk, and said
so.
When Nanny heard my patient calling to me,
she trotted into the bedroom and seemed to take
in the situation at a glance.
“ Would you be after bringing the dipper,
please, mum ? ”
When I brought the dipper Nanny was on the
bed, and she amused herself by nibbling the bed_
clothes while her overflowing udder was relieved'
It was a funny scene. But the invalid was not
hurt, and the jug-made tea was much improved.
I was given a huge dried snake-skin, and the
snake’s vertebral column, with a-box of birds’-
eggs and a dingo-skin, as “ presents.” There was
also a boomerang. I felt the gifts to be appro-
priate mementoes : and they adorn the walls of
our Nurses’ Home in the city.
* # #
A few days later, Davis took me to the coach.
The driver made room for me, beside him, in
silence. He said nothing until we had travelled
over a mile. Then :
“ Yer spiled yer looks that last shot! ” and he
eyed me critically.
“I did not sleep much for the insects,” I re-
marked.
“Nobody ever thinks of taking a bed there,”
he said.
After a pause of a quarter-mile, he added, “ It’s
a damn buggy shop ! ”
I quite agreed with him.

“Mister” Gladstone has discovered that
the English language is in extensive use amongst
Germans, and regards this blessed fact—the com-
mercial reason for which is squalidly obvious to
ordinary persons —as an assurance of the strong
fraternal sentiment between the two countries,
which he trusted would long continue to be the
great security for the peace and happiness of the
world. Ghastly cant! At the very time when
France was in arms against Europe, French was
the only language in which the diplomats of the
Holy Alliance could transact their correspondence
with each other.

Some Vic. justices put up a really good
record the other day. The son of another justice
was charged with embezzlement, and in the
ordinary course of things would have gone to a
higher court, where he might possibly have had a
bad time. But he offered to plead guilty to
larceny, that being a crime within the jurisdiction
of a J.P., and the charge was altered accordingly.
Then the accused pleaded guilty as promised, and
the bench promptly acquitted the, son of their
colleague without a stain on his character, on the
ground, no doubt, that he didn’t know what he
was talking about.

Dear Bulletin, —Outside of his grandilo-
quence and disposition to drop into “poetry,”
Fitz Gibbon is not a bad sort of ex-Town Clerk.
He has done something for Melbourne. In
former times, Fitz. put himself out of the way to
obtain the reservation of public gardens and parks
for the people. More than that, he took care to
erect innumerable notice-boards, reminding the
Philistines that the gardens were their own pro-
perty, and exhorting them to behave accordingly.
Circumstances have brought all the vanity and
flunkeyism of Fitz Gibbon to the surface of his
character, but the average man might have
enjoyed all the Old Tin’s good luck and perquisites
without preserving half as much public spirit
through the ordeal. Compared with those civic
knights Bingy Benjy and Snowden, the blather-
ski ting C.M.G. pans out well.—Yours, Oilcan.
The Passing of Morrissey .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O’Flynn cloaked the symptoms of Morrissey’s dis-
order under a veil of professional slang. He said
also: “Within twenty-four hours he dies. The
evil he did ye, speculators and turfmen, was
according to our gospel. His hand and brain
made many paupers. To you, Alf., son of Levi,
I shall give thirty in a hundred. Marker, my
cue.”
A tall, red-whiskered man, known as “ Ginger,
the Sloth,” leaned across the baize: “Hith tote
wath a rotten thwindle, anyhow.”
Another gentleman, in a white-buff coat and
pince-nez, requested him, in the name of the
Messiah, to hold his peace. O’Flynn gave Alf. a
miss in baulk.
I was “marker” at the club where these
fashionable sports foregathered. The news of
Morrisey’s approaching end filled me with a
savage gladness. For had he not robbed, cheated,
and tricked me of an inheritance; had he not
reviled and abused me in public ?
Once he offered a piece of jewellery to my starv-
ing wife. My sleep is charged with nightmares
of Morrissey ; for ever my fingers are dabbling in
the fat of his hideous throat. Within 24 hours !
Oh, blessed doctor!
That night I stole to Morrissey’s residence.
They permitted me to sit beside him in his room.
The white heap in the bed moved; the grossness
of his nature defiled the image of God and man.
He peeped at me from his flesh-bagged cheeks;
he houghed, houghed as a sow with litter. I did
not speak ; we watched each other.
Violent reflex action would cause death imme-
diately, O’Flynn had said—O’Flynn the Daniel
of physicians. Violent reflex action. Once he
shifted, but those eyes, those little peeping eyes,
were always looking into mine. A distant clock
struck two. From my pocket I took a tortoise-
shell box. The lid flew back, causing me to sneeze
several times. I approached the door, closing it
very softly. His eyes now followed the box in
my hand. For the first time his lips moved.
“ Christ! If I could only do that, too. Dick,
I’m stuffed up—baked, I want to, to . , . my
head, the box, the box !”
“1n24 hours, Morrissey, less ”
“The box—hough, hough !”
I held the lid slightly open until it dropped in a
thin stream under the pug-nose and waited.
It seemed that he was trying to cough ; the bed
surged and creaked with his struggles ; a sudden
paroxysm bent him. He sneezed, and his was reflex
action : something popped like a cork. From his
eyes, mouth, and finger-ends spurted the crimson
fluid. I stole softly from the room.
