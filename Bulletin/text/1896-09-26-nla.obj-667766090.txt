is ample room for quotation. We mighteasily fill several

there are half-a-dozen fit to rank with the best short tales

literary sense, the most faultless set of delineations of
bush and backblocks life which has yet been produced in

THE RED PAGE.
Hexameters—More or Less.
It is sometimes complained that The Bu
letin does not print long poems. T
answer (in the old form) is easy : The Bu
letin rarely has space for long poems ; i
never receives long poems ; there are no 16
poems. Poe’s dictum was contradictec
(merely) by a while-ago contributor ; but i
reasonableness is patent.
The phrase, “a long poem,” is simply a f]
contradiction in terms. A poem deserves
title only inasmuch as it excites, by elevating t
soul. Ihe value of the poem is in the ratio of tl
elevating excitement. But all excitements ar
through a psychal necessity [we would prefer
say physical necessity], transient. That degree o
excitement which would entitle a poem to bes
called at all cannot be sustained throughout
composition of any great length. After the lap
ot half-an-hour, ab the very utmost, it flags—fai
a revulsion ensues—and then the poem is,
effect, and in fact, no longer such.
u Poe instances “ Paradise Lost”—which
“to be regarded as poetical only when
losing sight of that vital requisite in a’
works of Art, Unity, we view it merely as
series of minor poems.” And if the essenc
°f Poetry is its power to elevate the sou
this 'must follow-—until the human brair
becomes capable of working at the liighes
tension for, say, 48 hours at a stretch.
* * * *
You can add Shakespeare to the a posterior
argument. Many persons prefer his sonnet
to his plays: hardly anyone admires the
plays in their totality. What we value are
the short, interspersed, poetical passages : the
dramatic action is often incoherent, fre
quently ludicrous, hardly ever exciting
And nine persons in ten, asked for their
favourite poem, will quote you some brie:
lyric of half-a-dozen verses—all pregnanl
with intense emotion. You may weld lyric
passages into an epic or a drama, and add
the force of narrative or of character, but the
‘poetry remains always in the lyric passages.
Its effect may be intensified by their situation
—never created. The modern mind will
rarely endure narrative, or descriptive, or
didactic verse; and it follows from this
exordium that—supposing an elevation of
thought to be the thing sought—the modern
mind is artistically right. Poe presaged
what is now a general attitude. Most
of us are mental flesh-eaters, as well as
physical—wanting much stimulus in small
compass. When an ounce of lyric meat is
obtainable, why munch a yard of epic celery 1
* * * •
Nevertheless, bulk counts ; and The Bul-
letin is always on the look-out for an Aus-
tralian poet who shall combine epic scope
with lyric force. And, in the meantime,
some passages may be quoted from two sets
of alleged hexameters which have recently
found lodgment in this office. Perhaps it is
unnecessary to declare that the hexameter
will never be any good in English; but it
is not any good—as poetry. It has to be so
artful that it loses all its energy. Nearly
everybody who adds a little Greek and Latin
to a little knack of verse has tried the classi-
cal metres; and the results, from Philip
Sidney’s downwards, have always a foreign,
literary-exercisish flavor. Our best trans-
lators of Homer and Virgil have known or
felt this. Perhaps the very best English
translation of the HCneid, spirit and letter,
is that by Conington—in the metre of
Marmion ! And of Clough, and Kings-
ley, and Longfellow one can only say that
the effect is occasionally pleasant, and the
hexameters are generally dubious, and it
appears that with the same expenditure of
poetical force the writers might have achieved
a better result in blank verse or the heroic
couplet.
• * * *
Poe, who was really a most acute literary
critic, put his pen on the weak spots. Eng-
lish hexameters are not good, he said, because
English, as compared with Greek and Latin,
wants spondees and vowels. And he trod
hard on Longfellow’s dactylic feet, and un-
kindly showed what “respectable prose”
the Longfellownian hexameter made, thus:—
Also the church within was adorned ; for this
was the season | when the young, their parents’
hope and the loved ones of Heaven, | should, at
the feet of the altar, renew the vows of their
baptism. | Therefore, each nook and corner was
swept and cleaned ; and the dust was | blown
from the walls and ceiling, and from the oil-
painted benches.
Are these lines in the Longfellow of to-day
Bat four-fifths of “ Evangeline ” and “Miles
Standish ” convert just as prosaically. And
Calverley, a master of classical translation,
invites comparison of
Silenced but unconvinced, when the story was
ended, the blacksmith,
or,
Clasped each other’s hand, and interchanged
pledges of friendship
with the first line of the Iliad. “Silenc’d but”
is a dactyl, encdb a short syllable. “Interchang’d
pledges ” is a reproduction of menin aeide. Only
conceive the havoc that we should make in one of
Homer’s lines if we inserted here and there such
encumbrances as ncdb, ngdpl, between two of the
short vowels.
It seems that the English hexameter, as a
poetical vehicle, “ must go.” William Wat-
son, in his recent “Hymn to the Sea,”
alternates it with pentameter, and gets neat
academic effects—but no poetry. And the
critics allege that Ovid “makes mock of”
our pentameters also.
* * * *
This is an unpromising introduction to the
“Railroad Medley” sent to The Bulletin
from far-away Venice; but “Beta’s” hexa-
meters, if they may not get rid of the primal
curse of their being, are quite good enough
to blunt any secondary objurgations.
A RAILROAD MEDLEY.
Oub from the roar and the smoke with speed that
grows faster and faster,
Leaving behind you the shouts and guards and
porters and faces ; . . .
Oub by the signals and points ; and the strident
cry of the levers
Rings in the signalman’s box as the carriages
swing round the curving,
Hurl you back with a jolt, in fear of immediate
destruction.
Then comes a description of the ride through
suburbs—“ an ocean of brick ” —till the roofs
grow sparser, and the train reaches the open
country. Then—•
Onward through valley and wold, in a maddening
waltz with the landscape
Circling its arms round you in wilder and wilder
embraces.
Deep is the green of the fields and deeper the
green of the hedgerows
Towering to elmy heights, that are quick with the
voice of the song-bird.
Placid the stretch of the meads, that from green
are kindled to golden,
Down by the marge of the stream where the king-
cups glow by the water,
Reaching in sinuous bands as they follow the
bends of the river.
Up to their knees are the kine in the cool, deep
grass of the meadow,
Languidly whisking their tails and chewing the
cud sigh complacent ;
Or one moistens his nose in a pool that is circled
with sedges. . . .
And now, alas ! three-fourths of the ‘ ‘ med-
ley”—some good, all readable—is sacrificed
to inexorable Space—the modern fourth Fate,
most fatal. The train has left the valley, and
climbs the heights to the really poetical close—
Onward you speed through a world that is moon-
lit, mystical, magic;
Follow the edge of a lake where the mists lie,
never a ripple ;
Faintly and cold through the haze hang the
ghostly shadows of pine woods,
Vague on the further shore where the rocks sink
sheer to the water;
Forests are falling down from the crags that are
broken and buttressed,
Soaring in opaline blue with a fine white veil from
their summit
Blown like a streamer afar to its fringe that is
silver’d with moonlight;
Wizardry domes and spires with a world of pale
light behind them,
Magical cups of the hills where the clouds lie
folded in slumber.
Here at the side that you skirt rise the tall brown
sedge and the bulrush
Rigid, erect from the mere; on the motionless
surface reflections.
On to the end of the Lake where the waters con-
found with the marsh land,
Growing each moment more firm; and the aide
shake and the aspens
Till these thicken and bind and condense at la
to a forest,
Walnuts and oak trees blent, and the inoonligi
lies on the purlieus ;
Whitely they fly like wraiths : To the heart of th
shadowy woodland
Onward you speed through the gloom and th
light from the leaves flecked around you. . .
Ah ! what a rout is that in the mist by the marg
of the lakelet;
Just where the willows bend and whisper anc
bow to the water,
Bacchus gleams there white, and the ivy berrie
that bind him
Round by the loins hang loose and beat like bell
to his dancing;
Thyrsus in hand and the cloak of the tiger’s-skin
from his shoulders
Flung far back, and there glows the broad expans
of his bosom;
Thyrsus he flings .aloft, while the Maenads mad
den about him,
Cast bare arms to the breeze with their tresse
a-stream on the night wind,
But not a sound is heard from the ghostly dance
of the Bacchse
Threading athwart the gloom and the light ii
shadowy forest.
So sink to sleep again ; and at length in the gray
of the dawning
You will awake and look out and see the whole
land lapped in
Motionless mists that, like dreams, the sun wil
scatter at rising.
Bacchus and his rout we have seen before
but they always make a pleasant picture.
Not so pleasant, maybe, to Longfellow’s ad-
mirers will be some passages from a locally-
produced parody on “Evangeline,” by
“ Bogg c -,” who writes that
Longfellow’s hexameters rouse me to frenzy.
Longfellow wasn’t a poet, anyway; but a very
labored rhymester who appears to have, “con-
veyed ” gems from half-a-score of literatures to
adorn his own uninspired verse, where they lie (in
Sheridan’s simile) “like lumps of marl on a barren
moor, encumbering what it is not in their power
to fertilise.” But his one-leg;ged spondees, and
the abysmic commonplace of his sentiments, toge-
ther move me to perpetrate this—by the mile.
ANNA MARIA: A TALE OF HYSTERIA.
This is the forest primeval. The murmuring
pines and theAemlocks
Stand in precisely the fashion in which other
hemlocks and pines stand—
Stand with their roots in the ground and their
other ends adverse;
Stand like serried skittles, awaiting the ball of the
•pitcher ;
Stand like members of Parliament, seeking the
eye of the Speaker.
Loud from its rocky caverns, the deep-voiced
neighbouring ocean
Shrieks, and in accents disconsolate answers the
howl of the forest.
In the Hysterian land, on the shores of the Basin
of Minas,
Distant, secluded, still, the little village of Grand-
Pre
Lay in the fruitful valley, looked as if fallen
asleep there.
Never the bustle of steam, or the clearing-out
sales of the drapers
Troubled its peaceful repose, or the heads of its
slow-going people.
(Please note just at this point of my story serenely
the sun sank.)
“Boggs” unkindly lays stress on Long-
fellow’s stage-carpenter’s moon and sun—
rising and setting whenever a simile seems
necessary. Then he describes the Hysterian
hero and his daughter :—
Somewhat apart from the village, and nearer the
Basin of Minas
Lazarus Aaronson dwelt, the richest pawnbroker
in Grand-Pre—
He and his child, sweet Anna Maria, the pride of
the village.
He was no great shakes to look at, was avarioious
old Lazarus —- *-
Warped were his back and his morals : his nose
was warped also ;
But gay Anna Maria more than made up for the
failings
Which a too critical optic might have perceived in
her father.
The courtship of Anna Maria and John
Henry, son of Billy the Butcher, gets due
attention, and there is a fine picture of the
consternation caused by the edict of exile
“ Notice ! Notice 1 Notice ! ” (This was the hor-
rible way it read.)
“Any Hysterian found in Hysteria after 6th
proximo,
Will be, sans further warning, summoned accord-
ing to law.”
When old Lazarus heard it, he gave bub cne crv.
“ O my shekels ! ”
Then fell headlong to earth and died in warpish
convulsions.
Down sank the sun, and the gloaming came over
the village of Grand-Pre,
Up rose the sun next morning, quite in accordance
with habit ;
Still, it does no harm to state the fact and it starts
the day’s work fair.
The embarkation is ruthlessly carried out •
John Henry and Anna Maria get on differ-
ent steamers ; and spend the rest of their
lives in agonised search for each other.
Once they almost met, in boats on the Father of
Waters :
Anna Maria slept, and her craft was moored to a
mud-bank ;
But the useful sun, quite tired of rising and
setting,
Dawdled in bed five minutes —in which five
minutes John Henry,
Passed in his little skiff, unknowing his fowl was
handy.
True, some tremor of sound, skimming over the
wavelets,
Made him rest on his oars, the while he mur-
mured, reflecting :
“ That sounds like the snore of my own, my Anna
Maria? ”
But the whisper passed on, and so did John
Henry. At last, grown very gray and feeble,
he reaches an Indian camp, where the chief
and his white-skinned wife sit apart in their
wigwam—
Old was she and ill-favored, yet he prized her
above the others,
Simply because her hue was a change from their
blank sameness.
John Henry spies her—
Then with one terrible cry of “ My long-lost Anna
Maria 1 ”
Fell like a log at her feet, and was picked up dead
as a door-nail.
Down the moon sank; but the sun didn’t rise,
for it was not quite time to.
And these are all hexameters—more or less.


Medical.
COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers, from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. . It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.— Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my ease every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received bis education in the English apd Scottish
univtrsil ies, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
protession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer trout any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely:—frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, iV,c.,
&e., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt oe 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CUKED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with these diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILITY,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.

is absolutely assured.

remedies, and never, under any circumstances,
prescribes Mercury in any form.

BEFORE YOU
T. E A F»!
When you go out shopping, consider, think
of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-
tation in the form of a pretty show ; there is
B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and C,
who says that he is the man for your money ;
and so on, throughout a list as long as
George-street, each smiling dealer has some-
thing to say and to offer.
Please Pause!
Hearken not to the song of the syren, sing
she ever so sweetly ; heed not the voice of
the charmer, charm he never so wisely.
Your pocket’s concerned; and there are
pirates about. As the poet pertinently puts
it: “ There be land-sharks and water-
sharks,” and it is for you to see that' your
dealings are with none of these voracious
monsters. Take warning in time, for it will
be no use when the new taxes come round—
and the tax-gatherer won’t take no for an
answer—for you to plead : There would have
been enough and to spare had I been wise
enough to

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A ROSY PHILOSOPHY.
Here’s a rule for all occasions—
Have it out!
Shun postponements and evasions—
Have it out.
Whate ’er your age or sex is,
Every problem that perplexes,
Every ill that bores or vexes—
Have it out.
Have you griefs and feel like crying ?
Have it out.
Raging, laughing, sobbing, sighing—
Have it out.
Are you e’er inclined for swearing,
For desponding or despairing?
Let your passion get an airing—•
Have it out.
Is your pet corn burning, aching ?
Have it out.
Is a tooth your slumber breaking ?
Have it out.
Do you seek fresh care to borrow,
Brooding o’er some dark to : morrow?
Holds your heart a rooted sorrow ?
Have it out.
If your mistress acts unkindly,
Have it out.
Worship not the blind god blindly ;
Have it out.
Though the false one fair may be
Other girls are fair as she ;
There are good fish in the sea—
Have ’em out!
That osseous depos.it—
Have it out!
That skeleton in closet —
Have it out!
As you sail the ocean frisky, ■
With your “ innards ” feeling risky,
Even though it should be whisky—
Have it out !
Has your debtor turned elusive ?
Have it out!
Is your creditor abusive ?
Have it out!
In a quarrel with your Maker,
Your mahatma or your fakir,
Your butcher or your baker—
Have it out !
Have you differed with your neighbor ?
Have it out.
Does your “ mountain ” heave with labor?
Have it out.
Is your “ mouse ” a tender story,
Or a poem grim and gory ?
For ridicule or glory—
Have it out!
Does remorse or terror haunt you ?
Have it out.
Let no secret rise to daunt you.
Have it out.
Concealment’s too much trouble;
A lie bursts like a bubble ;
Truth is cheap, and wears just double :
Have it out!
In short, on all occasions
Have it out ;
Doubts, fears, wiles or provocations,
Have it out.
Live your life, full, up-to-date ;
Love your love and hate your hate ;
Never dally till “ too late ”
Have it out !

THE CURLEW CRY.
O sweet pale night, thine own soft moon is flinging
Rays o’er the trees, where not a bird is singing—
(No nightingales are in this land, and pied
Songsters are sleeping till the morning tide.)
But stay —a plaintive note comes softly shrill
From out the .shadows of that facing hill.
It rises front the first low tone’s appeal
And wild entreaty fills the next (unseal
Your heart of pity, listener, for this
Sad soul in bondage !) till the long leaves kiss
Each other in the wondering that follows
That sound that cleaves them through with pain.
The hollows
Then breathe that note’s death in the first again
Repeated in the fading of the call.
What is this, seems to chill with grief, that all
Our blood stands sudden still in its warm rush,
And only forward moves when that the hush
That follows the lone cry is most complete.
(And yet that wail had something of the sweet
Hid in its plaintiveness, if well you note.)
Is there a gate of Hades hidden here,
Where through Eurydice’s lost cry doth float
Full of regret, and pain, and lonely fear ?
“ O, Orpheus, Orpheus ! O my love, again
If I could see thee, touch thee, then all pain
Would seem as nothing- -but that cannot he !
Not any more lives life for thee and me.
No more for us Spring’s sun, Spring’s flowers,
Spring’s tears —
Only thy music’s ghost is in my ears ;
Here among shadows—other ghosts—a ghost!
O lost my love, for ever lost, lost, . . . lost! ”

THE LOGIC OF BRITISH CAPITAL.
“The leading Westralian mining co.’s contemplate making a big reduction in wages. In a speech made by Lord Castledown at a meeting of the West Australian Goldfields, Limited, last month,
here is another straw which shows how the wind is blowing. He said: ‘ The labor, so difficult a problem in Africa, one which has been the real cause of all the bloody fights now going on in
Mashonaland, will undoubtedly be solved in West Australia on different and more satisfactory lines. It may be that the white man will remain the sole factor in the labor question there, or it is
possible that some of the large laboring races may be imported from neighboring shores to work under the superintendence of the colonists.”— DAILY PAPER.
J, BULL: “My troubles about ‘ Australia for the Australians !’ Wot I says is, ‘ Australia for dividends on British capital.' Nigger labor means big dividends. If you weren’t
born a nigger — well, is that the fault of British capital, hey?"

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1896.
Maoriland and its Prospects.
The Maoriland general election is due in a
few weeks, and already there has set in the
infuriated rush of candidates resolved to save
the country at any cost. The Seddon
Government goes into the contest heavily
handicapped by its own old age, and if it
wins, which The Bulletin regards as a
practical certainty, it will be the best testi-
monial which any Government has yet re-
ceived in any of the Seven Provinces. The
present M.L. Ministry has already served
through two Parliaments. It was created
—as the Ballance-Seddon Cabinet—in
January, 1891, and started business with a
large majority. It was returned again with
a still larger majority at the beginning of
1894—a wholly unprecedented circumstance,
seeing that the average Ministry has worn
out its welcome after an existence of three
years, and it is unusual even to get a second
lease of life by a small majority, while the
ordinary course of events is for the ordinary
Government to be thrown out with con-
tumely at the very first opportunity. As
a rule, the Ministry and the Opposition are
so much alike that the country hates most
the one it has lately seen the most of, and
throws out the party last in power, which-
ever party it is, simply because it has had
the best chance of making its ugliness visible.
If any ordinary Ministry did, by any pos-
sible chance, get six years’ continuous lease
of office, its chances at the polls, after such a
prolonged opportunity to exhibit its useless-
ness, would be absolutely nil, and even the
prospects of the Ministers retaining their
own seats would hardly be worth mentioning.
Under these circumstances, the fact that the
Seddon Ministry is admitted, even by its
opponents, to have a good prospect of a third
majority, stamps it as a wholly unusual
Ministry which either deserves better of the
country than any which went before it—or
has somehow contrived to make the country
think it does.
* * * *
In party politics the party out of office has
no chance to make any serious mistakes of
commission, because it has no opportunity to
do anything. Its business is mostly to howl
at the Government for not doing things
without showing, how they should he done.
If the Government does things which turn
out badly, the Opposition has to be wise
after the event, and show that it wouldn’t
have done them or would have done them
quite differently. If the Government does
them well, it shows, without taking any re-
sponsibility, how it would have done them a
lot better. If the Government shows a sur-
plus it can prove that the surplus ought to
have been larger, also that more money
should have been spent in certain directions,
and that taxation should have been reduced,
and that there is really no surplus at all. The
Maoriland Opposition has had six years of
this sort of thing. It is six years since it had
a chance to make any bad blunders of its
own ; and the Government, having been six
years in office, or more than twice as long as
the average period, has had every chance to
make twice as many blunders as usual.
Also, it has had time to lose twice as many
opportunities, and leave twice as many things
undone. The common or garden Cabinet
starts with one or two ideas only, and when
it uses them up —provided it survives all
other mishaps—it dies because it has nothing
left to promise the people which looks like an
adequate reason for its continuance in office.
The present Democratic Ministry has filled
in six years of hard work, and has used up
as many inspirations as would have served to
keep the old variety of politician in office for
a quarter of a century ; and still it has a
large, vigorous programme left. This says a
great deal for its vitality, at all events.
* * * *
The Seddon Government deserves well of
the people mainly for its energy and fear-
lessness. When it came into office there
were many questions waiting which could
only be settled by experiment. The average
politician endeavors to pass these difficulties
on to the next man ; he advocates trying the
experiment, but lets the next man do it. If
it turns out well, he gets part of the credit as
a persistent advocate of the measure who
didn’t take any chances ; if it turns out badly,
the responsibility is left to the other man.
The woman-suffrage question was looming
large in politics when the Democratic Minis-
try assumed office. It was obvious that,
some time or other, some Government must
tackle it and risk the consequences, and the
Seddon Ministry took the risk. It took an-
other huge risk in settling the Midland Rail-
way trouble—a matter which obviously had
to be seized with both hands sooner or later,
but which a weaker Government would have
passed on to the next man rather than stake
its existence on the matter. It did the same
with the Bank of New Zealand difficulty—
which, considering the size of the institution,
and the size of the crisis which had come
upon it, and the smallness of the community
which had to meet it, was quite as large a
financial problem as that which, in ’93, hope-
lessly staggered the Butcher Patterson Go-
vernment in Melbourne, and which the Dibbs
Government in Sydney only met when the
mischief was half-done. The manner in
which it was settled may not have
been the best or the wisest, but time
was short and the position was novel, and, on
the whole, the Seddon Ministry did better
than any other Australasian Ministry ever
did under like circumstances. There are any
number of people— The Budletin included
—who can see now, after 18 months con-
sideration, that the thing might have been
done better, but there are very few who, at
18 hours notice, would have done it so
courageously or so well. In establishing
the State Land Bank, also, the Seddon Cabinet
might have done better, as the more recent
and better-conceived South Australian insti-
tution has demonstrated, but it was neces-
sary that some one should lead the way, and
make the first experiment, and thereby
supply the experience for those who came
after. The Maoriland State Land Bank, so
far, is successful and solvent, and all the
Seven Provinces owe a debt of gratitude to
the Ministry which had the courage to take
the first step in this matter. If it hadn’t
done so the S.A. institution might have been
non-existent, and the proposed State Banks
of Victoria and N.S.W. might not even have
been mentioned.
* * * *
In addition to all this the present Maori-
land Government was the first to seriously
attack the question of breaking up the big
estates and providing land for the people. It
! ias gone into the land resumption and sub-
division business on a huge scale, has pro-
vided homes for a large number of people,
and despite the jeremiads about its “ ruinous
Socialistic policy ” it has made the business
yield a handsome profit to the Treasury.
Its loan-conversion policy is proving a suc-
cess, and causing a large reduction in the
interest burden, despite all manner of
prophecies to the contrary. It has
established the graduated land-tax whereby
the big estate-holders are heavily penalised,
and the further accumulation of huge areas
made practically impossible, and it has im-
posed an absentee-tax. It was the first
Government which sent Labor members to
the Upper House, and thus broke up the
ancient monopoly whereby that Chamber
was practically a House of Landlords. Also,
it practically abolished the nefarious “ truck
system ” ; passed a stringent Factory Act
which has wiped out unwholesome and in-
sanitary factories and workshops ; applied
the co-operative system successfully to public
works ; abolished the life tenure of members
of the Council; gave a half-holiday to shop-
assistants ; and led the way, as usual, with
the policy of old-age pensions. Its further
programme includes a State Fire Insurance
system, the fixing of maximum rates of
interest, a fair-rent scheme, State audit of
companies’ accounts, the . shutting out ot
Chinese and other undesirable immigrants,
Local Government reform, the adoption of
the Betterment principle, and many other
measures, the desirability of which is suffi-
ciently evidenced by the wrath of the lat
Man and his press organs.

Maoriland .is the only province in Aus-
tralasia which is burdened with a huge war
debt, therefore the difficulty experienced
there in making ends meet is not such a
proof of financial incapacity as a similar diffi-
culty would be in more fortunate Australia.
Also, it had to set aside a large part of its
lands as provision for a native race too
numerous and warlike to be bounced out. of
its inheritance like the feeble Australian
aboriginals, consequently it never had the
magnificent land revenue which N.S.W. and
Queensland enjoyed. What land revenue
there was had been mostly dissipated long
before the Ballance-Seddon Government
came into office ; the largest territorial re-
venue it ever received in one year was
£364,000, which compares very badly with
the £2,000,000 that forms the average land
revenue of New South Wales. Also, the
Democratic Ministry took office at a time of
awful depression, when borrowing had been
carried to the last extremity ; and in the face
of all these difficulties it has achieved wonders.
It lias led the way in more Democratic re-
forms than any six of its predecessors, and it
has manfully faced all tlie accumulation of
problems left it by its time-serving predeces-
sors, and hardly ever attempted to gain ease
in its own time by the usual expedient of
passing its difficulties on to posterity.
Its huge financial experiments, hazardous as
they were deemed by all manner of alleged
experts, have turned out right so far as any
definite results have yet been arrived at, and
even financial experts cannot argue against
success.
* * * *
There have, of course, been mistakes and
failures in the Seddon Government’s career.
There are failures in the record of every
Government "which does anything and every
other Government as well, and the Maoriland
Ministry has done so much more than the
average, and most of it in ways where there
were few precedents to go upon and very
little past experience to serve as a guide,
that the only wonder is that the failures have
not been ten times as numerous as they are.
Progress of any kind involves the absolute
necessity of someone leading the way,
and no merely human politician can do
that without making mistakes which will
have to be rectified later on. The Seddon
Ministry, if it lives, will probably, sooner or
later, carry its social legislation too far and
make itself ridiculous by attempting the im-
possible, for the sufficient reason that every
great movement generally goes too far, and
in many matters no one can tell save by ex-
periment where the impossible really begins.
Its leader is fiercely autocratic in many
respects ; the Ward scandal seriously dam-
aged its prestige; and the resumption of
borrowing, evenonacomparativelysmallscale,
and the seizure of the local sinking-funds,
show that its finance is weak and, in times
of necessity, tolerably unprincipled. Against
these things, however, it has to be remem-
bered that tlie alternative is a Russell- Tory-
National Ass Ministry which would be equally
autocratic if it had a similar majority
behind it because Party Government is
constructed that way. Also the Russell
party is the one which borrowed ten millions
where Seddon borrows one, and whose
finance was much more shady and foolish
than Seddon s at its worst, and which can
show old financial scandals compared to which
the Ward episode sinks to comparative in-
significance. The alternative lies between
the Ministry whose enthusiasm for social re-
form may possibly carry it too far forward
and one which has no policy except undoing
what has already been done and going back
to the old stagnation. Considering all the
circumstances and possibilities of the case
the best course Maoriland can adopt is to
return the Seddon Government to office by
the biggest majority it can raise and risk the
consequences. A Ministry which can stand
six years of power without falling into utter
discredit is an institution which only comes
along once in a century or more, and the
country which throws it lightly away will
probably have cause to regret its action later
on and keep on regretting it for long after-
wards. Any Ministry, under the party sys-
tem, is only the less of two evils, but in this
case there seems such a vast disproportion
between the evils that there is no room for
hesitation.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Suffield Case.
Neyv South Wales Department of Alleged
Justice yields—one inch ; which means that
Suffield has one foot out of his pigeon-hole.
WuY’ ag t e ' ~h eT \ V ho e U,an wiU be out presently.
Hit lie i to, the Department has strenuously and
continuously refused to do a very simple thing
—a thing done every week in a score of matters
of less importance—it has refused to lay the
papers m Suffield’s case upon the Assembly
table Apparently the Department thought it
best for the public not to know too much about
the Suffield case But now-of its own free-
will, of course and because it is suddenly con-
vinced that the public ought to know all
about the matter, and not at all on account
of any little press or Parliamentary insist
the Department will actually produce the
depositions and comments. It excludes «„d-
--understood, one paper—ex-Judee Wix’rWvl I s
reply to a previous agitation. This renlv, ? S
rally bolstered up the Windeykr viewin’ 1 '
case-fancy a Judge of the Windeykr tvnl ,
nutting error !-and how bolstered ?
rently by suggesting, as Griffith, M p !, P , pa '
in the Assembly the other evening that ‘
minent female witness for the defenJ. P '°'
unduly fond of Suffield. Evidence » p"£
Seemingly there is none, beyond the state n en
that when or before Suffield was sent to 3
for ten years this witness, in whose home hi
had lived, ‘‘ran to meet him, embraced him
and fell on Ins neck, and kissed him • and ti
wept ” in the fine old Biblical fashion S
no woman ever so kiss Mr. Windeykr/ T
not, he is to be pitied. Doubtless the disnl-iv
of such emotions is “bad form” in fashio.ffi
circles. But the witness whose character Mr
Windeykr is said to assail does not move in
fashionable circles. She belongs to the homelv
warm-hearted, toiling class who have not learm
the art of concealing their feelings, and W
and cry, and love, and hate, as naturally and’
spontaneously as—as human beings in f-J
Suffield has—or had, poor wretch'— a most
attractive personality. Everybody liked him
He had the frank eyes, the clean body the
manly, magnetic presence whose charm
Whitman never tired of singing. The very
sheriff s assistant burst into tears when his
sentence was pronounced. And this woman
whom Mr. Windeykr appears to accuse-who
has a daughter 22 years old, and is herself
almost old enough to be Suffield’s mother—
this woman had known Suffield as a member
of her household, intimately, for a long time
She heard him accused of a dishonoring crime
a crime which would wreck his life utterly’
She utterly refused to believe the charge • she
knew (at any rate she swore) that he was at
home when the alleged offence was committed
And, in her passion and sympathy, she
threw her arms about Suffield’s neck and
kissed him. That seems absolutely all the
warrant for Mr. Windeyer’s alleged imputa-
tion. The writer knows none of the parties
concerned, but he would he very sorry indeed
if his friends, the people in whose home he
lived, showed no sympathy or emotion at find-
ing him accused, as Suffield was, of a crime
of which they knew or thought they knew him
guiltless. All the same, no opinion is here ex-
pressed as to Suffield’s innocence. Ex-Judge
Windeyer’s instinct—the nice-little-womaii-
can’t-be-wrong instinct—may have brought him,
as in the Dean case, to a conclusion unwar-
ranted by the evidence which was yet the right
conclusion. But guess-justice isn’t good enough.
We want fact-justice, evidence-justice, proof-
justice. Out with Suffield from his pigeon-
hole !
The Omnipotent Frock-Coat.
A smirking individual in a long black frock-coat
and wearing a belltopper of offensive glossiness
stood at the bar of Melb. City Court last week,
charged with indecent exposure in a city park
at midday. He was arrested on the spot, and
told the constable who locked him up that he
was guilty, and that, though lie was sorry for
what he had done, he really could not help
himself. Asking for leniency, prisoner’s at-
torney set forth that the crime was inexplicable
and, from its very nature, the act of a lunatic,
and then proceeded to call a number of
witnesses to character. These showed that the
black-coated Maedonaldite had lived for 20
years in the odor of sanctity, and had occu-
pied the position of Sunday-school superinten-
dent with great credit. It also showed
(which was far more material) that the man
suffered from dizziness and, on occasions, from
religious mania. The case concluding, the
P.M. remarked feelingly that it was an awful
thing for a man in the accused’s position,
etc., and lined him £3. The extraordinary
part of the sentence is that during the past 12
months lialf-a dozen cases of similar sort have
been before the same court, and that in the five
of those where convictions were obtained terms
of imprisonment varying from three to twelve
months have been ordered, only one prisoner
escaping without a flogging ! And in the first
six of tlie seven cases referred to accused were
all of the laboring class, one of those flogged
being a ragged, half-starved-looking boy of .15
years. At Melb. City Court the cranky mole-
skin “ exposer ” averages six months and ten
lashes, while the cranky, white-faced, Sabbath-
school boss is permitted to insult and scare
decent women for 60s. The proper place for
all sucli offenders is obviously the lunatic-
asylum rather than the gaol, and if the law.
with its administrators, were not a brute as
well as an ass, it would recognise that fact.
Still, as tilings stand, they show once again the
force of The Bulletin’s now cliestnuttv truism
that no long hat and frock-coat ever yet lay
beside the triangles. Again let it be yelled
through Australia— Tiie lash is for the man
in workman’s garb and for him only !
Old-Age Pensions.
The N.S.W. Parliamentary Committee on Old-
Age Pensions has sent in a report in which it
tackles this difficult question in rather a weak,
spirit, and with, apparently, a limited amount
of success. The gist of its recommendations is
that all single people over 60, who have resided
for fifteen years in the province, and whose
incomes do not exceed <£so a year, shall be
pensioned at the rate of 10s. per week, and
married couples at the rate of 15s. per week.
These proposals seem fair and reasonable; at
all events, the 15s. is none too extravagant.
The cost is reckoned at <£90,000 a year, and to
raise this amount it is proposed to legalise the
“ tote ” and charge per cent, on all moneys
passing through it, which is expected to pro;
duce <£35,000 ; to levy an “ entertainment and
sports’ tax ” of Id. per ticket, estimated at
£8000; to take £II,OOO from the asylum vote,
it being estimated that the pension system will
save that amount of the present charitable
expenditure; to annex for pension purposes the
revenue from billiard licenses (£8000) ; revenue
from fines for drunkenness and breaches of the
jicensing law (,£6000) ; and to draw £22,000


The Convict Butler.
from the general revenue. In view of these
proposals, The Bulletin respectfully offers the
opinion that the committee has made a bad
mess of a great and urgent question. In the
first place, it is reckoned that there are, in
N.S. Wales, nearly 53,000 people aged over
60, but by leaving out those with incomes of
more than £SO a year, and those who have been
resident less than 15 years in the province,
it is expected to bring the pensioners down to
4000 or a little less. This is such a stupendous
reduction that it is difficult to place much faith
in the estimate. At all events, even if the esti-
mate is correct, the figures are likely to increase
considerably within a few years after the estab-
lishment of the system, for N.S. Wales will
necessarily be recognised as a good place for an
elderly person with 12 or 13 years’ residence at
his credit to remain in and complete his qualifi-
cation. It is a noteworthy fact, by the way,
that in Maoriland, where it is proposed to fix
the pension age at 65 instead of 60, and to
insist on 20 instead of 15 years’ residence, the
annual cost of a very similar pension system for
a much smaller population has been estimated
as high as £150,000. Anyhow, the proportion
of people between 60 and 107 —the alleged age
of the oldest cornstalk inhabitant—wflio have
incomes of £SO a year in their own right is none
too large, and as people drop out of their rov-
ing habits with age, the proportion of them
who are qualified by 15 years’ residence is pro-
bably greater than might be supposed. As to
the means of raising the scanty £90,000 a year,
it is suggested that no less than £36,000 of it
is to come out of general revenue, and as the
revenue, in most cases, has no money to spare,
it will probably have to fill the gap with new
taxation, so the Pension Committee hasn’t ex-
plained where the money is to come from—lt
has only suggested that the Treasurer should
do the explanation for it, so far as this £36,000
is concerned. Also, the £II,OOO which it is
proposed to save out of the Charitable Vote is
another doubtful item ; the said vote isn’t nearly
large enough to cope with the aggregate dis-
tress, and even if the pressure upon it is
relieved to some extent by the Old Age Pension
system it will still be inadequate, and nothing
can fairly be spared out of it. The facts of the
case, in The Bulletin’s opinion, are that the
suggested pension system is much more likely
to cost £150,000 or even £200,000 a year than
£90,000, and that, considering the straiteued
condition of the Treasury, all the money must
be raised by new expedients. There are abun-
dant ways of raising it in addition to the
“ tote” and the proposed tax on entertainments.
A tax on bicycles, a graduated tax on estates
over £SOOO in value, newspaper postage, a tax
on patent medicines, absentee tax, tax on
foreign fire-insurance companies, and the annex-
tion by the State of unclaimed balances and
dividends are a few of the methods by which
the required result would be arrived at. If
they left a considerable margin in the meantime,
30 much the better. When Federation arrives
it will be hardly possible to draw provincial
distinctions, and if 15 years’ residence in any
part of the Federated provinces is then fixed as
the qualification, the pension Bill will probably
l go up 50 per cent, in one act. /

Teetotal Twaddle.
At the Victorian Alliance Anniversary (Argus
report) :
Mr. John Yale, the secretary, said the expenditure last
year on drink in this colony was <£3 2s. 9d. per head of the
population, which was 10s. per head less than the expendi-
ture of the mother country. The drink expenditure last
year was the lowest in the history of the colony, the
principal causes of which were the diminished spending
power of the people and the emigration of the male popu-
lation.
The logical conclusion, therefore, is that the
more males take themselves out of a country,
and the lower the wages paid to those who re-
main, the less drink will be consumed, and
(vide the usual Cold Tea arguments) the
greater the national prosperity ! Which con-
stitutes a paradoxical tangle more fatal to tee-
total tendencies than the alluring barmaid ; no
ordinary individual can unravel it and keep
sober, and no cold-water crank this paper ever
met could justify the abject hopelessness of the
position unless loaded up to the muzzle with
the most virplent of snake-juice. Alfred
Deakin was the next speaker, and got this off
his bosom:—
Every measure that tended to improve the conditions
of living tended towards the temperance of the com-
munity, and the village settlement measure, the measures
to deal with the mallee country, and the Factories and
Shops Act were of this character.
If that doesn’t entirely knock the bottom out
of the John Vale sample of teetotal logic it is
nobody’s business.
Lepers at the Back Door.
Says a Launceston correspondent: —
Twenty-nine more Chinamen have just landed in Tas-
mania. Sixteen had naturalisation-papers, and thirteen
paid the poll-tax of £lO. Five of the latter were vacci-
nated by the Government medical officer before being
allowed to land. And such a landing ! The file of weedy,
dirty - looking, undersized specimens of hopelessness
crawled from the deck of the lighter up on to the wharf,
each dragging his goods and chattels after him in bundles
of wretchedness tied up with cane and greasy string. An
acclimatised Chinaman took charge of the queer proces-
sion, and it crawled away up the street, a policeman
keeping well to windward. Before the cortege marched
sundry small boys, who rose to the occasion mer-
rily and assumed the role of drill - instructors.
That sextapedal monster of smiling yellow ugliness
with a freshly-vaccinated tail, crawling up an Austra-
lian street at the mocking invitation of a little
regiment of rosy-cheeked, clean-limbed white urchins
was, to say the least, suggestive. Meantime, the
Treasurer pockets £l3O, and the portly and eminently
respectable citizen smiles a smile of vacant imbecility.
Tasmania seems fated to be the back-door of Australia in
this as in other matters. A small boat can sail across
from Northern Tasmania to Southern Victoria in a couple
of short days, which may account for the apparent dis-
crepancy between the number of Yic. Chinamen and the
amount of poll-taxes credited. It may also, in a measure,
account for the often-noticed fact that many Melb. Chows
profess a surprisingly correct geographical knowledge of
“ Gipshelan’.” If the mainland authorities are not too
busy letting the leper in via the Northern Territory they
might direct a glance towards Vandemonia. And if it is
a Federal glance, so much the better.

The Protected Industries of N.S.W.
Dear Bulletin, —It is a strange commentary
on Freetrade as the alleged “settled policy ” of
N.S. Wales that almost every important indus-
try which the province possesses has been
established by, or assisted by, Protection in
one form or another. Early pastoral and agri-
cultural industry was subsidised by free grants
of land to start with and by the supply of com-
pulsory cheap convict labor, the convicts
answering all the purposes of slaves without
any preliminary outlay for purchase. The early
settlers had the country opened up for them by
cheap convict labor supplied by the State.
Great tracts of pasturage were also leased to
them at a mere peppercorn rental; they didn’t
have to buy the land—it was stolen for them
almost gratis by a paternal Government. The
pastoral industry was, and is, further subsidised
by the construction of railways which carry its
produce to the seaboard far below cost; the
general revenue and the railways of the non-
pastoral districts are taxed to the extent
of nearly £300,000 a year to thus subsi-
dise the wool interest. The beer and wine-
making industries grew up under tariff Protec-
tion, and Premier Reid allows them to remain
at least partially protected by the difference
between the Customs and excise duties. The
manufacture of spirits and tobacco is protected
in the same fashion. The sugar-industry was
created by Protection. The production of
biscuits, confectionery, butter, cheese, bacon,
hams, kerosene, galvanised iron, timber, fruit,
rope, doors and sashes, maizena, preserves,
candles, and cement come under the same cate-
gory —all these industries were helped along by
protective duties imposed and retained by suc-
cessive Freetrade Goverments. The press is
protected by a halfpenny postage duty on papers
from outside the province while those inside the
province go free ; this means, in most cases, 50
per cent, protection. In short, there are so
very few industries in New-South Wales which
haven’t been helped along by Protection that
the alleged “ settled policy ” is a mockery and
a melancholy lie—and it always has been so.—
J.A.H. ■
Dear Bulletin,—To show the absurdity and
danger of the fiscal plebiscite proposed by
M'Gowan, M.L.A., it is only necessary to re-
member a comparison noted by the late Walter
Bagehot, who points out that at the time of
the Crimean War English public opinion in 24
hours was able to turn out the Quaker (Aber-
deen) and put in the pugilist (Palmerston) to
rule and save the nation. On the other hand,
the man who suddenly stepped into Lincoln’s
shoes defied American public opinion for two
years, and laughed at impeachments. In
Britain power has passed from the sovereign to
a committee dependent on the vote of the
people’s representatives. America, on the other
hand, is ruled by a committee independent of
the people and their representatives during a
certain term. Does Mr. M'Gowen know that in
England the fiscal question was quickly decided
as soon as the people made up their minds ?
And until they do so here it is better to have
an election every six months than to enslave
public opinion for any fixed period. In some
Greek republics legislators passed laws and
decreed that those who proposed their repeal
should be put to death. When repeal became
a public necessity, as it always must in such
cases, the patriots who proposed it wore halters
around their own necks. Does M‘Gowen advo-
cate the halter ?—Y.
A country attorney sends The Bulletin the
following circular lately issued by the Incor-
porated Law Institute of New South Wales
2 Castlereagh Street, Sydney,
Sydney, September 15th, 1896.
Dear Sir,
The attention of the Council has been directed to the
practice, which apparently is growing up amongst counter
solicitors, of sending instructions to law-stationers in
Sydney to do conveyancing work, which is really of a pro-
fessional nature —as, for instance, the examination of
abstracts of title with the original deeds.
The Council considers that this practice is open to
objection on many grounds ; and that work of the kind
mentioned should be entrusted only to persons in the
regular employment of the country solicitor or his town
agent.
I am directed to call your attention to the matter, and
to ask your co-operation in putting an end to this undesir-
able practice.
I am, dear sir, faithfully yours,
J. P. CREED, Secretary.
“ I employ a law-stationer to do my searches and
engrossing, and I intend to continue doing so,”
remarks The Bulletin correspondent, “ unless
the Judges order otherwise. No doubt it would
suit Sydney agents very well indeed to have
this work done by themselves, for -which they
charge excessive fees, while not doing the work
half as well as a professional searcher. The
Law Society very largely concerns itself with
advancing the interests of Sydney solicitors,
and in its advocacy thereof often borders on
impertinence. A law-stationer charges 2s. 6d.
an hour for a search in the Deeds Office, a
Sydney solicitor at least as many guineas—and,
of course, the client has to pay. It is a well-
known fact that the Sydney agent gets 50 per
cent, of the costs (as drawn to scale), and this
means often that the poor country solicitor has
simply to take what he can get.”
Ed. Bulletin, — Permit me to disagree with
your theory of “even-handed justice,” as you
appear to understand it. Take, for instance,
the case of the Melb. Union Bank clerk who
came up the other day to receive sentence for
embezzlement. He pleaded for mercy, chiefly
on the ground that he had “ friends who would
help him in the uphill fight of the future,” but
Judge Chomley said “ the prisoner appeared
to have been very deliberate in his thefts, and
his offence could not possibly be treated as a
light one.” Then the Judge inflicted 9 months
hard labor upon the bank-clerk, which is about
the average penalty imposed upon any friend-
less person who “ shakes ” a pair of blankets.
Yet, perhaps, it was enough punishment tor
the clerk under the circumstances, if the object
of imprisonment is to deter the offender from
further crime. Justice in criminal law seems
to be properly regulated by social considera-
tions, despite democratic argument to the
contrary. The poor man who steals a pair of
blankets is such a small thief in comparison
with the embezzling clerk that he might be let
off with 24 hours’ imprisonment, but for the
fact that such a proportionately ample sentence
wouldn’t be calculated to keep him straight for
the future. Poverty, although not actually a
crime, is equivalent to a crime, and it increases
the necessary severity of the sentence accord-
ingly. A scale of punishment for robbery,
based on the money values (so to speak) of the
thefts without any regard for persons, would
be absurdly rough on the harassed individual
who borrows a modest amount from his em-
ployer “without mentioning of it.”—Yours, E.
♦
The question as to who is a “ person in autho-
rity ” has given rise to a marked difference of
opinion among the N.S. W. Judges. Poisoner-
perjurer Dean’s lawyer, in the appeal made to
the Full Court, argued that the chairman of the
Dean Defence Committee was such a person,
and that Dean’s confession, having been obtained
through an inducement held out by that gentle-
man, could not legally be evidence against his
client. As is known, the Judges refused to
accept this view of the case and dismissed the
appeal. A case on all-fours was tried at
Grafton some time since, a young lady being
accused of having robbed her employer of
goods and money. At the first trial the jury
disagreed, and at the second prosecutrix swore
that accused had made a partial confession
when she (the witness) remarked on the accused
hesitating, “ Well, you had better tell me all.”
This brought defending solicitor Donaldson to
his feet to argue that as witness was a “person
in authority ” such a remark could only be con-
strued as an inducement, therefore any subse-
quent alleged confession by his client could not
be evidence. Hence he protested against it
going to the jury. Judge Cohen upheld the
attorney’s contention and the case broke down.
And so very likely would the case against
Dean break down—before the Privy Council.
Australia’s annual tribute to China of hysteri-
cal, parson-drunk girls still continues : last
week five misguided young women were
despatched to the Chow Mission Minotaur by
a white-faced crowd, who themselves stay at
home and guzzle the good things of this life.
The Ku-Cheng massacre of last year, so far
from scaring off the Australian female mission-
aries, seems to have turned a lot of falterers
into active workers—just as, when one woman
suicides in any unusual fashion, an epidemic of
the new felo de se immediately follows until it
gets “common.” Some years ago it became a
popular amusement for the grisettes of Paris
to jump off the topmost pinnacle of Notre Dame
cathedral and dash themselves to pieces on the
stones below. The practice was at length
stopped by the State prohibiting the publica-
tion of such suicides. Had any Australian
Govt, “savee” enough to award a twelve
months’ “ hard ” to anyone mentioning the
name of any woman in the capacity of a female
missionary before any congregation or assem-
blage, or any newspaper proprietor publishing
the same, there would be a sudden cessation of
the exodus of these shepherd-drunk women,
who would work off their superfluous enthusiasm
by banging a tambourine in the local “ Sal.,” or,
better still, by marrying stalwart policemen.
Sundry fossil members of the British Medical
Association have lately tried to pass a resolu-
tion bringing the words “ physician and sur-
geon,” on a professional door-plate, under the
head of advertising. Up to now, as a London
weekly remarks, young and struggling doctors
were expected to merely hang out their signs
and then starve until patients began to roll up.
The B.M.A. objects even to the sign. A saw-
bones is asked to rest content with billing his
bare name on the door, in order that the prac-
titioners with well-known names of their own
to work upon, or the surname of a well-known
relative, may be the only persons to get any
legitimate advertisement worth mentioning.
All professional associations that The Bulletin
ever heard of are actuated by much the same
conservative principle. It is called etiquette,
forsooth. Etiquette demands that a doctor
who, after earning a lucrative reputation in
Sydney, is advised to move to Melbourne for
the sake of his health, shall reject every temp-
tation to announce his arrival other than by a
respectable brass plate, and wait for his rivals
in the new city to tell their friends of the good
new man who has just opened an opposition shop.

My clothes are patched from the collar to the

with the industrial system which allots such a

the country’s hardest and most necessary work,
under the most unpleasant conditions, while
the stockbroker, the wild-cat promoter, the

A Maoriland correspondent to The Bulletin : —
Re your mention of that extraordinary criminal, Butler,
and judge Holroyd’s sentence upon him. I was present
in an official capacity at his trial, at Dunedin in 1880, for
the murder of the Dewar family, husband, wife, and child,
and again at his subsequent trial for burglar}'. The
murder-trial w T as, in some respects, most remarkable. In
the first place, Butler was not defended by counsel, and
he had, without professional assistance, to face the minute
and tireless attack of a Crown Prosecutor like Haggitt.
I shall never forget the pertinacity of his defence, and the
uncanny, nervous way in which he chewed and chipped
his pencil as he followed and noted the evidence. He
gave one the impression of intense vitality.
The crime w'as a most extraordinary one. It was
committed so stealthily as to leave no clue; yet
the site of the murder was one of the most
densely - populated parts of Dunedin, the Dewars’
cottage being literally wedged in between three
other cottages and facing, just across Cumberland-
street, a row of inhabited dwelling-houses. I saw the
cottage in exactly the state it was in when the murder was
committed. The huge blood-splashes were fresh on the
walls of the tiny room in which the man, wife, and child
were done to death. And the marvel of the whole thing was
how an able-bodied man and his wife could have been
overpowered so suddenly and swiftly as not to make a
single cry for help possible, or at least audible to the hun-
dreds sleeping so near them. When, too, one saw the
weapon of destruction, the Dewars’ own axe, which must
have been brought from their own wood-bin, and from
the amount of blood on the walls one realised that many
heavy blows must have been necessary to complete the
hideous job, the marvel was only accentuated fourfold.
It became apparent to all that either chance singularly
favored the murderer in his operations or that one had to
deal with a criminal of the most brilliant ingenuity and
possessed of an unsurpassable power of cool calculation.
All motive seemed to be wanting. Nobody, including
Butler, was known to have any grudge against the Dewars.
They possessed nothing worth stealing or which could he
proved to have been stolen. What conceivable motive,
then, had Butler or anyone else in killing them ? This
was a serious difficulty where the circumstantial evidence
was inconclusive. And Butler made excellent use of it—
far better than nine out of ten counsel could have done
for him. No matter how' keen the public instinct as to
Butler’s guilt, there was really only one item of evidence
w'hich could be described as seriously incriminating him.
It was the condition of his clothes. On his shirt were
found hundreds of very minute blood-specks, many of
them no larger than a pin’s head. They were so numerous
and so w'idely scattered over the arms and front por-
tion of the shirt that it seemed impossible to account
for them by any of the ordinary contingencies of
life. This evidence was brought out in court late one
afternoon during the trial ; and it was most in-
structive and significant to note how Butler took
it. He did an immense deal of pencil-biting rapidly,
and w'ith evident sense of irritation and anxiety, and
complained that the police had “ sprung a mine on him.”
He asked to be allowed to examine the clothes in ques-
tion. His whole attitude was one of deeply intensified
interest. The presiding Judge told him he w r ould
certainly be allow’ed to examine any exhibit at the rising
of the court next day.
Butler’s quick intelligence and fertile imagination
soon gave him a defence on this point, amply
adequate to secure an acquittal even if it did not
prove his innocence. Butler discovered that, in addition
to the blood on the shirt, there were blood stains on the
coat and waistcoat he v T as alleged to have worn during
the murder. The size and position of these he carefully
noted, and when his speech for his defence came it was
v'orth hearing. He was adroit enough to call no witnesses.
Consequently he had, according to the local procedure,
the last word, in reply to the Crown Prosecutor. He said
that the whole case for the Crown rested on those blood
spots. What, to begin with, w r ere they to hang a man
for? Everyone had his clothing more or less so stained
through the innumerable petty accidents of life. A cut
from a razor, or a tramp such as he had when
lately moving through rough country, might be ample to
account for such an appearance.
But to pass on, he said, the theory of the Crown was self-
destructive. Blood was found on his coat, waistcoat and
shirt. The Crown said that the sleeves and front of the
shirt were so besprinkled with blood that it was evident
this came from the bodies as they were being chopped up
by the murderer. But if so, it was obvious that the
murderer had his coat off, and his waistcoat too. That
the Crown seemed to admit. But if it admitted this,
then how about the marks on the coat and waistcoat ?
They must evidently have come from the same source ;
the Crown witnesses, or some of them (said Butler)
admitted this. Then if so, it was clear (and he pro-
ceeded to a detailed and most ingenious treatment of
this portion of the evidence) that the coat and waistcoat
were on and being worn by the murderer at the time he
was committing the murder. Perhaps, however, some
might say that the murderer had deliberately torn off his
coat and waistcoat and proceeded to chop up his victims
like so much wood ; and that whilst the shirt was be-
sprinkled while worn, the coat and waistcoat were
spotted whilst hanging up. This was a ridiculous hypo-
thesis, because it implied a degree of deliberation and
preparation which would be obviously quite incredible.
The Crown, then (said Butler) was in this dilemma. Either
the coat and waistcoat were on, in which case there
should be no spots of blood on the shirt; or they were
off, which was for the reasons given a palpable absurdity,
or at least a gross improbability. This was his defence.
After he had spoken it was clear that he was certain ol
an acquittal. But Judge Williams’s charge made doubly
sure of this ; and looking back upon the result, with
twelve years’ experience, I think the Judge and jury were
right. Not that Butler’s innocence was clear : far be it
from me to say that. He was undoubtedly under the
gravest suspicion ; and the newspapers did not hesitate
to say his acquittal was a miscarriage of justice. Yet
it would have been going further than our tradi-
tions of justice have hitherto gone to convict Butler on
the evidence given. The single item of the blood-spots
was in itself insufficient, to my mind. Yet it is certain
that the evidence might have taken a different shape and
been much more dangerous to Butler had he been de-
prived, immediately on his arrest, of his coat and waist-
coat, which he was, by some extraordinary oversight,
allowed to wear for some days in gaol, and which may, in
the matter of blood-marks, have undergone, by accident
or design, many changes.
Butler’s subsequent trial for burglary was deprived
of its interest by his plea of guilty. He pleaded
guilty to a charge of arson and burglary at the
same time, the inmates of the house being very nearly
burned to death. Anyhow, for this batch of offences
(which included the theft of some church music from the
8.. C. Church—Butler was always fond of sacred music),
he was sentenced to 18 years’ penal servitude, a sentence
which in some small degree tended to appease the public
indignation on account of his acquittal of the murder.
Any notice of Butler and his doings would be incomplete
without mention of the on dit current in Dunedin at that
time about his previous exploits. He had been, I think,
about three weeks out of gaol when he was re-arrested foi
the murder of the Dewars. The term of his expired sen
tence was, I think, four years.
His crime was burglary, or rather several bur
glaries alleged to have been committed under the
following circumstances : Butler came to Dunedir
as the teacher of a Sunday -school in the bad
country of Otago, where he had been stopping. He
was introduced to the Hon. Mr. D (a wealthy anei
well-known Dunedinite) as an active and energetic
“worker” (as no doubt he was, though in a different
line). Mr. D met him on a Sunday afternoon and
(so the story ran) invited Butler to tea. The host had a
distinct leaning himself towards sanctity and Sunday-
schools, and he welcomed any “ good young man ” who
was “ proud to live in the service of the Lord and glad to
die in His army.” So Butler was well-treated and invited
to tea that Sabbath afternoon. No, he said, he could not
stop to tea. He had an engagement. Oh, well, his host
hoped to see him again, and wished him “ God speed” in
the good work he had set himself to do. And so they
parted. The church-bells were just ringing and Butler,
quietly sauntering from the stately and holy pre-
cincts of his host and well - wisher’s mansion,
noted that another ten minutes would see many
of his friends and fellow-workers praising the Lord in the
Lord’s House. He would let them assemble in peace.
For that day he would not join in the ordinary hymns
and chants of humanity, but would do his own little
private prayer alone.
And so Butler whiled away the few minutes
before the services began. And then with a mixture
of the sanctimonious and the cynical Mr. Butler, alias
Smith, alias Donnelly, alias &c., &c., &c., proceeded
to enter quietly and unobtrusively one house after
another of the absent worshippers—four houses in all—
and made a more or less valuable haul in each. In the
end Mr. Butler—l had almost written the Reverend Mr.
Butler—was convicted and sentenced as above recorded.
All of which, as I have said, shortly preceded the cele-
brated trial of what was known as “The Cumberland-
street Tragedy,” where man, wife, and babe were hurried
into oblivion by somebody’s ill-doing. Which somebody
is “to the jurors unknown,” though one day we may
know him.—P’lbbcemax X.
The me anest man, it seems, isn’t much
worse than the mean corporation. For the last 15
years a road-mender has been employed by Don-
caster (Vic.) shire at wages which have from time
to time been reduced from Bs. to ss. per day. Not
content with this, the Council decided at a recent
meeting that as the aged pulveriser was now over
70 and unable to pound bluestone with as much
vigor as heretofore, his services were not worth
more than 4s. a day, which sum the ancient
laborer is to receive until such time as the Council
decides to give him 3s. At this rate he has only
to live long enough to reach an age when he will
have to pay the shire for the pleasure of filling
holes with hunks of metal.

“In Mizzoura,” Nat. Goodwin’s second
effort at Sydney Lyceum, is such an immense im-
provement on the futile “ Nominee ” that the
selection of the latter as the introductory piece of
the season is hereby charitably ascribed to drink.
‘ Mizzoura ” has a distinctly American atmosphere
about it. It is redolent of the land of the wooden
ham and the huckleberry watch—the land where
Napoleon B. Scadder sells wooden oats to Hamil-
ton J. Morgan, and where every citizen has an
initial in the middle of his name. Two of the
scenes are laid in Joe Vernon’s “living-room,”
and the last one is located in Jim Radburn’s
“door-yard,” and, as there never was a “door-
yard ” in Australia, the result is distinctly educa-
tional. The play is a clever, pretty picture of life
in a woolly land, where the people work hard and
talk slowly, and get their beer from the “ drug-
store ” on account of Prohibition, and go out occa-
sionally on an honest, large-hearted impulse to
hang somebody, and think better of it afterwards.
Taking it all round, it is about the best drama
which Australia has seen since the advent of the
“ Silver King,” and the Sheriff is about the best
stage-hero that the Lyceum has contained up to
date. No one is in a hurry in this restful drama,
save the horse-thief when he is getting away, and
the huge person with the yard of beard when he
rises with his store-clothes on and harangues the
mob which has called round to hang its fallen idol,
the Sheriff. Sam and Dave, and Esrom and Cal
all worry peacefully through their summer exist-
ence. ’Liz’beth falls asleep standing right through
the piece; and nothing disturbs the placid calm
of Em’ly ; and Jim, when his free and enlightened
fellow-citizens are seen in the distance with a rope,
slowly writes out his resignation and puts his
collar away in his hat so that it will
be out of the way if he is hanged, and
he will, be able to find it again if he isn’t,
careful inspection having shown him that the said
collar isn’t quite exhausted and may do another
day. He also decides inwardly, even at this
crisis, that if he isn’t hanged, and if Kate resolves
to marry him instead of the train robber, he will
have a new verandah added to the house and keep
a hired gal. Jim, the sheriff, is the sort of man
that a tired, hurried world could lean against com-
fortably for a moment’s repose, and Missouri, like
New Mexico, seems to be the Land of Pretty
Soon, where Dan’l refuses to be troubled even by
an earthquake, and Hank is for ever at rest.
* • • •
The co. shows quite unexpected possibili-
ties in “Mizzoura.” The play suits it down to
the ground, and its nasal snuffle is in keeping with
its surroundings. Nat Goodwin’s Sheriff—the
strong, tired man with the chivalrous soul—is an
almost perfect piece of acting. There are touches
of comedy and poetry all through the character of
the Sheriff, and Goodwin scores at every point.
’Liz’beth, the tired girl, played by Miss Ethel
Browning, is probably second biggest success in
the piece, but the Colonel and Jo and Bill and
Dave—especially Jo and Dave, who are repre-
sented by Clarence Handyside and Louis Payne—
are all excellent, and there are many good points
about Em’ly and Mrs. Jo. The beauteous Maxine
Elliot does her part as Kate in a good ordinary
fashion, and Sam represents the only really depres-
sing feature in the show. There is much elaborate
stage realism about “Mizzoura,” which is hereby
recommended as a clever drama, full of good dia-
logue, and one which every member of the com-
munity ought to see for the good of his soul, if he
thinks he has one.
** * *
Her Majesty’s (Sydney) has re-opened for
a spell of “ Fun on the Bristol,” which old-time
shriek seems to be not so seriously dead as might
have been expected. The present version is not
very much worse than the original. William Cos-
grove’s widow hasn’t the unctuous voice of Johnny
Sheridan, but he is a very good widow none the
less. The most distinctly weak point of the show
is Wilfred Shine as Count Menaggio; that very
clever Irish comedian can’t even make a decent
beginning at being a broken-Italian comedian,
and he seems to be painfully aware of the fact.
There have been many Menaggios, beginning with
Knight Aston, who was distinctly the best, and
the misplaced Shine is far down the list. Also,
Jules Simonsen doesn’t even profess seriously to
be Richard Sparks. Otherwise, however, the co.,
especially Forde, Tom Cosgrove, Maude Lita and
Fanny Wiseman, is satisfactory in the main.
Forde and Tom Cosgrove are about the best Cran-
berry and son up to date. There is a lot of
musical talent in the co., and if something really
dreadful were done to one young man in the con-
cert-scene, and if some of the songs were a little
more novel, it would be good all through. As
regards the young man aforementioned, he should
be permanently exiled to Five Dock.

The Bulletin’s favorable opinion of the
present Criterion comedy has not deteriorated
during the past week. Mrs. Brough’s spectacled
she-father rather improves than otherwise on
further acquaintance, and the feeble shamblings
of that bogus parent, and her goneness at the
knees, and the way her glasses fly all over the
place when she is “ shook ” by the enraged colonel
for saying that she slept in the same dormitory
with his wife when they were at school, and her
general tendency to provide outrage and then
crawl under the table to avoid the consequences,
are matters which make this tired paper feel
better. Still it is doubtful if Mrs. Brough has
struck the best conception of the character. The
wretched _ mother in the long tail-coat could be
rendered in various ways, and the fact that Mrs.
Brough makes her a defeated impostor from the
vei 7 beginning looks like a mistake. If she
rushed into the pants and the coat with a cheerful
confidence in her ability to do the part, and broke
up gradually afterwards, instead of losing her pre-
sence of mind and appearing as a routed being
from the first, the effect might be even more con-
vincing than it is. A father who obviously wants
to run for the door at the very moment of his
arrival has his drawbacks. Still that distressed
hemale is full of good points, and the present
writer, never having been in her painful situation,
can t say for certain how it would naturally pan
°ut. A citizen whose clothes have all vanished
while he was in swimming, and who finds himself
on the beach with nothing but a belltopper, trying
to pass himself off as a merman, might throw
some light on the true inwardness of the situation.

The Cimetographe, already much-described
in this column and spelled in many different
ways, is the latest addition to Rickards’
show at Sydney Tivoli. This latest kind of
’graphe enables any action or set of actions to be
photo’ed and reproduced life-size at any time
afterwards, so that the person who did it can
stand outside of himself, and see himself doing it,
and thereby realise what an awful spectacle he
looked when he did it. Therefore, the ’graphe
has a great mission to serve in this world, and
deserves encouragement.

R. D. Meagher, ex-lawyer and ex-M.L.A.,
started his Sydney lecturing season at the Opera
House last Monday. There was but a small
house, and to it the orator discoursed for
nearly two hours, mostly on the criminals he had
defended and who had been duly hanged. An
inspection of the dreary list suggests that almost
all the criminals whom the ex-advocate defended
were duly hanged. Mr. Meagher, as a lecturer, is
a very moderate success. There are many
sonorous adjectives in his discourse, and they are
often heaved in regardless of sense or sequence,
but they all sound like a big gong in the distance
on a still night. Thus, he speaks of Australia as
being on the “mighty threshold ” of a new life, and
a mighty threshold sounds as well as if thiscountry
was on the heroic oilcloth of a fresh epoch. Also,
the “ chaste portal ” of Federation is a good phrase,
and a chaste portal is better than an immortal
chimney-pot any day. The lecture is almost
wholly a dull, sordid recital of scenes in Darling-
hurst, not very well recited by a man with
painfully conspicuous hands, and it has penny
hunks of cheap pathos shoved in here and
there in a hard, plain fashion, as if the pathos
was a wooden plug, and there was a hole to fit it
into, and the lecture was a mallet. There are also
bits of gaol language here and there, and
the said language is mostly “ Blimy, Bill,”
and the like. There is no originality about
either “Blimy” or “Bill.” The pictures
the lecturer draws are not living or realistic ; and
they are not improved by the speaker’s habit of
closing his sentences with a sudden yelp, as if
someone had trodden unexpectedly on his tail.
They mostly end at the gallows ; and he follows
them with painful minuteness, and he and the
audience look down through the trap together
after them when they have dropped. On Monday
night almost the only occasion when the lecturer
got away from the subject of Darlinghurst and the
gallows was when he fled into a dreadful figure of
speech about “ the gladiator leaping into the Pan-
theon ” —at least it sounded like that; and the
remark was just about as probable as if he had
spoken of the omnibus leaping into the fried egg,
therefore it was a novelty and a relief. After
hearing Mr. Meagher lecture, the present writer no
longer wonders that so many of that very much-ex-
gentleman’s clients were found guilty; he came
within an ace of finding the doorkeeper guilty, as
he went down the stairs, and hanging him on the
spot.

The young lady with the smile like a gleam
of sunshine, whose portrait appears on page 10, is
Miss Lily Titheradge, of the Brough Comedy Co.,
the promising daughter of her father. The said
father has been for many years such an established
favorite wherever the old 8.8. combination was
known, that it is quite needless to be more definite.
Miss Lily Titheradge is very young—so young
that The Bulletin doesn’t profess to be sure of
her age, and her stage experience practically dates
from the co.’s recent tour in Queensland. Never-
theless, she has given promise of so much ability
that her future success seems certain. This paper
isn’t prepared to swear that she is faultlessly beau-
tiful, or that her sweet voice actually “ lays over ”
the angel choirs, or that her shoes are smaller than
No. 2’s, but it hereby backs her bright smile for a
reasonable sum against every other bright smile
on this continent.

“ Tattersall ” Adams’ Sydney Palace of
Varieties is rapidly approaching completion under
the direction of Architect Backhouse, and the
opening will take place in about two months’ time.
The new temple, the interior decoration of which
is sumptuous, will have seating accommodation
for 1500. A spacious promenade and lounge, in
which refreshments will be served, is attached to
the dress-circle, and will doubtless prove a boon
to the haughty patrons of that portion of the
house. Phil. Goatcher is lessee. It is not gener-
ally known, but it is nevertheless a fact, that Phil,
is closely related to George Washington, who
achieved some fame in the United States a con-
siderable time ago. This fact in itself is a suffi-
cient guarantee that matters affecting the brevity
of the skirts of female performers at the Palace
will be dealt with from a thoroughly disinterested
standpoint.

At Melb. Bijou, last Saturday, a more-or-
less amateur co., leavened by George Leopold,
gave a spirited revival of “Girofle-Girofla.” Old
warrior Leopold led the stage forces in person,
Harcourt Lee had control of the musical depart-
ment, and the show altogether seemed good enough
to run at popular prices for more than its adver-
tised four nights. Should this fact have happened
to get generally known in the meantime, Lecocq’s
opera will, no doubt, be carried right through the
current week, or even further. Melbourne has
almost forgotten the Frenchy plot of “Girofle-
Girofla. ” This is the tale of two twin-duplicate
sisters who are to marry respectively a mild,
gentle tenor, and a rampageous baritone Moor.
Owing to a temporary annexation of one sister by
pirates, the other sister, who amounts to precisely
the same blushing spinster, is compelled to marry
the Moor after committing matrimony with her
own appointed tenor, lest the dark heathen
should draw a semi-circular saw and lay the family
in ruins. The situation, therefore, threatens to
grow embarrassing until the first sister returns
from the pirates, and each husband is furnished
with a full allotment of wife.
* * * *
It says a good deal for the principal
amateurs concerned that George Leopold, in his
original character of the bald-headed father,
doesn’t appear like one acting alone in the wilder-
ness. The tenor, George Tutton, shapes well in
all respects, barring his feet, and shows more
stage intelligence than many full professional tenor
mummers. Miss Hesford Angus, as a tall, im-
posing mother-in-law, is quite at home in her
part, and Miss Mabelle Davidson, who played the
pair of twins on the first night, is a first-class
amateur prima-donna. She presents a nice appear-
ance and manner, in addition to a pleasing voice,
clear enunciation, and a highly seductive smile.
In fact, if the young lady watches herself care-
fully and keeps her smile under wise control,
she ought to be heard of anon. Ernest Fitts,
having a fine deep singing and speaking voice for
the noisy character of Mourzouk the Moor, counts
among the successes of the show. Other people
are not of much individual importance, so their
crimes may be overlooked. The orchestra is
pretty good, and the chorus capital. Also, the
few sweet girl-graduates in tights wear them to
advantage, but unfortunately there was one pair
unoccupied on Saturday. The missing damsel
had ventured to put ’em on at dress-rehearsals,
and yet when the awful night came she didn’t
arrive with it. The legs were willing, but the
spirit was weak.

After a furious run, faith in “ A Trip to
Chinatown” is abating somewhat at the Princess’s
as regards seats at five shillings, but at anything
under that price the American entertainment sells
quite as freely as ever. A second edition, so-called,
which came along on Saturday, proved to be the
same old first edition trimmed with fresh songs.
The fresh songs were generally older and fuller of
christv-minstrel sentiment than those they re-
placed, and the ballad about “ Molly Riley,”
warbled in all seriousness by the very large gentle-
man from behind a. capacious shirt-front didn’t
win much approbation in front of the house. The
singer’s artistic brothers and sisters on the stage
received “ Molly Riley ” with great applause, all
the, same. Nothing in “A Trip to Chinatown”
strikes one more forcibly than the patient cheer-
fulness with which the performers sit around and
express admiration for their own little concert.
They remind one of the children who are said to
“ enjoy it better than a pantomime.”

“ Tommy Atkins,” the second of George
Rignold’s*new melodramas from London, was to
succeed “ Called Back,” at Melb. Royal, on Wed-
nesday of this week. The manager himself will
be conspicuously absent from the cast of this huge
military undertaking, but a brass band and other
extra details too numerous to mention have been
engaged to fill the gap. The policy of changing
the bill in the middle of a week was a success in
the case of “Silver King” during Westmacott’s
season at the same house, and perhaps “ Tommy
Atkins ” will bring George Rignold a well-
deserved change of luck. It depends a good deal
on the cable liar. The Bulletin, in Mr. R.’s
place, would make private arrangements to pro-
cure a crisis at Constantinople and a war-scare of
the most jingo character.

The Yaidis Sisters, two muscular little
women in blue, are the latest attraction at the
Opera House. Their agrial gymnastics are new
and original, insofar that they perform on a
revolving double trapeze, brilliant with colored
electric-lighted lamps. Also, they shine person-
ally in the matter of being able to suspend them-
selves from a tricky little mouthpiece by their
teeth and spin around at a dizzy rate. Likewise,
one of the sisters dives into a net, and impresses
any beholders who haven’t seen graceful Madame
Antonio fall backwards from a much greater
height. By the way, Madame is to reappear at
the Exhibition Building next month.

About the last stage appearance of Madame
Simonsen (who died suddenly on Saturday night
last) happened at Melb. Opera House, some six or
seven years ago, when she played Maritana for
her benefit, There was a big muster of former
admirers—among them Parkes, who had come to
Melbourne for the Federation Conference—and
buxom Fanny’s performance showed good cause
and reason for the rally. Even then, at 55 years
of age, she sang much of the music fetchingly,
and many traces of endearing young charms were
apparent in her acting. “ Veri I first married my
Fanny she vas a very pritty girl,” Martin Simon-
sen used to say in his familiar discourses upon
“vimmin” in general. No doubt about it. A
better dramatic artist than any of her children,
Madame was the mother of at least one very
pretty girl and delightful vocalist in Francas
Saville, now almost world-famous. She was the
last of the old Melbourne brigade of operatic
singing mistresses, and many pupils* past and
present, must have been shocked to hear of her
sudden demise.
(For “ Poverty Point ” see page 20. J
Ex-Premier Dibbs, when sworn in the
other night as Captain-Commandant of N.S.W.
National Guard, took the oath of allegiance for,

oath-taking.
Rand wick course, on Thursday last, was
notable for the almost entire absence of the
Hebraic element, owing to the Day of Atonement
clashing with the race-meeting. The Gentile
usually does his atoning vicariously, but the
Israelite, who has to forego “ skinning the lamb ”
for a whole day, does a penance to which the raw
peas of the early pilgrims were a mere circum-
stance.
The death of the veteran Mr. Thomas
Buckland, late president of the Bank of N.S.W.,
and for nearly half-a-century a director of that
big institution, removes a clear-headed and able
citizen. Mr. Buckland was most exact when con-
trolling the money of others, as he did in his day
to perhaps a greater extent than any other
N.S.W. resident, but in his personal dealings
there was no more considerate or generous man.
Julia Batten, the Kilmore (Vic.) post-
mistress, convicted of embezzling savings-bank
deposits by means of forged signatures, is rather a
“fetching” woman with golden hair, and her
bright eyes seem to have pierced the court in a
tender spot. Bair Julia got away with 12 months,
a decidedly light reproof for committing forgery
at Govt, expense. Twelve months of such absence
from the man who ate the sugar—there must have
been a man ; it is only for love that spinsters steal
on a large scale—ought to make his heart grow
fonder, if he happens to have one concealed about
his person.
The other day Baron Von Norbeck, a
distinguished Austrian scientist, while exploring
on the island of Gualdalcanar, Solomon Islands,
was attacked by natives and fatally wounded. A
midshipman, two seamen and a native guide of the
party were also killed, and a petty officer has since
died of his wounds ; also, seven other members of
the party were more or less wounded. Absurd
attempts to preserve secresy about the matter on
the part of the Austrian authorities have led to
the formation of perhaps ill-grounded suspicions
that the “ attack by natives ” was connected with
another more or less misty alleged occurrence : it
is said that some weeks ago a seaman of the Alba-
tross struck an officer, and that after a court-
martial he was taken out of Sydney Harbor and
hanged to the ship’s yard-arm.
Verdon’s name was De Verdon, but lie
dropped the De on entering Democratic politics.
His brother, the barrister, stuck to it, and he had
another quasi-pastoral brother well-known at the
Albion. The j ust-deceased banker was the most
intensely clubbable Melbourner. This, however,
only dated from the loss of his wife, years ago.
With her he delighted to live at his Collins-street
banking-house in the city heart. Then he lived
at the Melb. Club, and was its unfailing dinner-
bell as he toddled up Collins-street eastward at
six o’clock. Verdon, not a snob, regretted the
decline of the gentlemanly element in politics.
Like Bob Lowe, he wanted the horny-handed to
fight by deputy through men of culchaw like him-
self, Roebuck and Pearson. Thus he could never
see the game of politics as worth fighting, unless
as in the Parliaments of his time, when a Charles
Jardine Don was an anomaly.
Henry Lawson’s poems get nearly three
pages of notice and quotation from R. Le Gal-
lienne in the English Idles. Neither Le Gallienne
nor the Idles has much critical reputation, but
they butter beautifully, and the magazine has
standing quite good enough to make such space-
allotment a plume in Lawson’s hat, while its
popularity assures a splendid and very unusual
advt. Le Gallienne quotes liberally from “Days
when the World was Wide,” “Faces in the
Street,” and “Star of Australasia,” and supplies
some rather lazy comment to the effect that Aus-
tralia’s ‘(mighty imagination and great heart”
have again escaped into literature, in “ a volume
to console one for the tantalising postponement of
Kipling’s sea-ballads.” Lawson’s “is essentially
music for the people.”
Melb. demise : Octogenarian Pastor James
Taylor. He passed three stages : Presbyterian,
Congregational, Baptist. While young, he became
one of the most eminent English dissenting min-
isters. His health broke down, but he defied the
medicos. Forty years ago he came to Melb., a
lean, withered little atomy, but reared a mighty
“cause” at Collins-street Baptist Church, which
he built, replacing a wooden, ramshackle one.
Undoubtedly recognised as the leading intellectual
Melb. clergyman, he was picked to begin the
Sunday theatre-services, at the Royal. Keenly
evangelical, what was the sensation when a scandal
arose in his congregation ! He was accused of
trifling with the wife of a deacon. A committee
of inquiry was headed by Pastor Poole, afterwards
Age sub-editor, who had such a narrow escape
in the Ly-ee-moon. It was cut short by Taylor’s
resignation. The committee put to him the in-
quiry, “ Was there actual transgression ? ” but the
answer is buried.

The Vic. Leg. Council’s Committee of Inquiry,
appointed to find excuses for not passing the Turner
Government’s Banking Bill, is plodding along with mild
gradualness. If it can’t show good reasons for rejecting
the measure outright, the next best thing is to fill in so
much time with the inquiry that the bill will be
crowded out at the end of the session ; which is probably
the reason for the gradualness. The Committee persis-
tently interrogates auditors and managers of banks which
survived the boom, but even among them the results so
far don’t amount to much. The Bank of Australasia man
and others object strongly to the proposed special audit
on application of a certain proportion of shareholders, on
the very reasonable ground that the agitation to get the
necessary quota of shareholders to sign the application
might create a panic. It being sufficiently proved that
the audit system can’t remain where it is, the obvious
remedy is to create a regular independent State
audit, which won’t require any agitation or any
panic to bring it about. One accountant sug-
gested that a special audit should be granted on the
application of one-tenth of the shareholders, provided
they have “ submitted questions to the directors and
failed to get satisfactory answers.” As the shareholders
always get satisfactory answers right up to the day before
the burst, the only trouble being that the satisfactory
answers are often quite untrue, this is a beautifully futile
idea. The same witness moaned about “ the danger to
managers and directors in the clause providing that they
should be prosecuted for distributing dividends out of
other moneys than profits. Nothing was said by anybody
about the danger to shareholders and creditors.
Several accountants protested against the State
demanding special qualifications from auditors : “ No
Government Board could demand better qualifications
than those insisted on by the Vie. Institute of Accoun-
tants.” Later it transpired that one-half the members
of the institute hadn’t been required to pass any examina-
tion at all. Anyhow, if the Government is only going to
demand from accountants the qualifications which
they already possess, what harm will it do to the accoun-
tants? The National Bank man complained bitterly
about the clause prohibiting banks making advances to
their own directors, and added that his bank had rigidly
abstained from making advances to its own directors.
Why he should object to not being allowed to do what
he never does is another professional mystery. Mr.
Gyles Turner, of the twice-reconstructed Commercial of
Australia, protested against the clause enacting that
all banks should balance on the same day—so that
the bank which is balancing couldn’t inflate its cash
reserves by borrowing from the one that isn’t. As a
matter of fact they never did such a thing. All his bank
did, said Turner, was to lend £lOO,OOO to the Mercantile on
11th January and call it up again on 3rd March. The
Mercantile balanced on Ist Feb., so this loan enabled it to
inflate its balance-sheet, and to deceive its shareholders
into the belief that business was looking up when it wasn’t,
and it apparently borrowed the money for that express
purpose. Gyles Turner, however, says the story is an
absolute misrepresentation ; all the Commercial did was
to lend the dying institution a lot of money before its
balance and get it back afterwards. And Gyles “isn’t
aware ” that the “ balancing trick ” is ever done ; he never
heard of it, anyhow.

The select committee of Vic. Leg. Council had
better, for the sake of decency, keep the name of Jabez
Balfour out of its precious enquiry into the Companies
Act Amendment Bill. One of its selected witnesses in-
formed it that the law as it stands against directors at
present is sufficiently stringent, and “ under it Jabez
Balfour had been sentenced quite recently to 14 years im-
prisonment.” Is this impudence or merely ignorance?
The financial law which struck J.B. was a vastly different
thing to the financial law advised upon by barristers in
Melbourne. Will any tall-hatted witness look The Bulle-
tin straight in the face and say that the robbery which
has gone unpunished in Smellbourne, because there was
“ no case” against the robbers, would have gone unpun-
ished under English interpretation of the English law—or
that Jabez Balfour would have come to prison through
running his group of companies in Smellbourne aforesaid ?
The Vic. companies’ law “ as it stands ” —or as it is admin-
istered—wouldn’t land Barrabbas in “quod”—not if he
were a chairman of directors.
• * * *
One objection to the new Vie. Companies Act
has something in it. Huddart Parker and Co., Howard
Smith and Sons, and other such “ private ” firms argue
that the publication of balance-sheets by companies which
don’t comprise more than 20 shareholders is certainly not
needed in the general public interests. On the principle
that secresy is guaranteed for income-tax returns, the
Amendment Bill should draw a distinction between com-
panies whose business represents the sole income, perhaps,
of a few partners, and the common or garden kind of
companies in which hundreds of shareholders make specu-
lative investments without being in a position to look at
the books or get any idea as to how things are being
managed.

The committee of inquiry appointed by M.L.
Leg. Council to inquire into the Bank of N.Z.’s affairs re-
ports that ex-Treas. Ward gained no advantage, and, so
far as the evidence shows, attempted to gain none by the
Colonial Bank amalgamation, and that there was no proof
of any corruption or improper conduct on the part of the
Government. As the Leg. Council committee—which is
quite a different thing from the one appointed by the
House of Representatives—represents to a great extent
the Fat Man and anti-Seddon element, this certificate of
character is worth something.

A week or two back an aged Bank of N.Z.
shareholder was sued for calls at Auckland. When de-
fendant’s name was called an ancient wreck got up with
difficulty and made his statement. “ I am 74 years of
age,” he said, “ and am unable to work through a paralytic
stroke. I saved up the money to buy these shares so as
to have a provision for my old age. I have paid two calls,
and have no more money.” Then the Court ordered the
sad Methuselah to pay £53 11s. 4d. and £5 Bs. costs. The
private-bank system is a great institution. Had the
B.N.Z. been a State bank it could never have cracked till
the country cracked.
• * * *
According to one witness at the Maoriland
Banking Inquiry, the total losses written off by the B.N.Z.
during its troubled existence of 35 years were over
£4,000,000.
* • • *
The vast, unwieldy concern, the Modern Per-
manent Building and Investment Society (Melbourne),
doesn’t look much better. The loss for the year ended
31st July is £11,431, compared with £2630 loss for the
previous year and £13,800 the year before, therefore
the concern is losing almost as much as it did
before it made an arrangement with its creditors, and
when the outlay for interest was £13,000 more than it is
now. The actual income (£21,289) is £4OOO less than it
was in ’95, which isn’t especially cheering. The Modern
is a concern which would have been solid and prosperous
if it hadn’t got the borrowed-money curse so badly. It
was built on £200,000 of shareholders’ money and
£500,000 of deposits, debentures, &c.,_ most of them Eng-
lish, and the interest on these weighs it down badly.
The report states that the assets haven’t been written
down and still appear at their book value, which is in-
teresting. Loans to the nominal value of £656,000 yield
£20,045, equal to a little over 3 per cent., and it would
seem that £40,000 worth of property was sold during the
year, and didn’t fetch the book value by £7900. Under
these conditions the said book values look rather un-
reliable.
• * * *
Victorian Permanent Building Society (Melb.)
shows a loss of £7439 for the year ended 31st July. Pre-
vious year the loss was £BlO7, and the year before £15,809,
so things are getting better in a certain limited sense.
Something over £400,000 of borrowed money is what is
the matter with the Victorian. The gross receipts are
£7991, and the interest on borrowed money alone is
£9404, and, taking things all round, the miserable concern
earns less than half its outlay. Loans to the alleged
value of £590,000 yield an average of £1 ss. per cent, per
anhum, so, on the interest return, it would look as if the
present value of this £590,000 of alleged securities was
something like £150,000. What improvement there is
arises wholly from reduction in interest and working ex-
penses ; the revenue keeps going down with a sickly thud.
It has dropped now to one-half of what it was two years
ago, and even then it wasn’t much.
* * * *
M‘Lean Bros, and Rigg (Limited) report that
the year’s profit is £135 (last year showed a loss of £2650),
equal to about 2s. Bd. per cent, per annum on the nominal
capital of £lOO,OOO, the other £150,000 having been
written off as lost. On the amount which the share-
holders put into the business, the profit is just about a
shilling per cent, per annum—one bob for every £lOO.

Commercial Bank of Australia’s .£lO preference
shares now stand at about £3 ss. Considering that they
are guaranteed a 2 per cent. div. for three years and 3£
per cent, afterwards, and will receive as much more div.
as the profits allow, this isn't much of a result, though it
is a good improvement on last year, when these shares
wandered between £1 2s. and £2 15s. Colonial (Melb.)
£9 15s. preference shares are offered vainly at £3 ss.
Against this, National (Melb.) are actually at a handsome
premium, and Bank of Victoria are nearly at par. Also,
National Bank deposits have sold in large quantities at
20s. Id. in the £. The saddest-looking Sydney bank
stock is the A. J.S. (£7 10s. paid up), selling at £llls. 6d.
Fifteen months ago they touched £2 Bs. According to
Monday’s quotations the A. J.S. per cent, deposits were
only worth about 15s. —a lower figure even than those of
the Commercial of Australia with their reduced rate of
interest—and A. J.S. inscribed 41 per cent, deposits were
offering at 12s. 6d., which looks like a bad case of want of
confidence. As for Queensland National deposits, the
bottom seems to have fallen out of the market, and buyers
offer 10s. in the £.
* * * *
Queensland Deposit Bank, which reconstructed
a few years ago, announces that it will probably ask for a
reduction of interest on its 4)4 per cent, deposits on the
general ground that business can’t be profitably conducted
at present rates.

Sauerbeck, the well-known statistician, reports
that the average prices of 45 principal commodities
touched the very lowest figure on record in June, ’96.
They were lower than even in Jan. and Feb., ’95, which
were formerly the record months for cheapness, and were
vastly lower than in Jan., ’94. This is rather rough on
the N.S.W. Foreign-trade party, which professes that the
reason why things are no cheaper now than in the Pro-
tectionist era is that prices have gone up in Ilingland.
And they haven’t gone up ; they’ve gone down.

The City of Melbourne Bank directors charged
with issuing false balance-sheets “were spared the
indignity of being placed in the dock, and were
accommodated with seats behind their counsel.” The
frock-coat again ! The poor devil of a baker’s carter
charged with embezzling 30s. he has collected for his
master, is never “ spared the indignity”—for he weareth
not a long hat. The Bulletin is not here arguing that
the bank-director should be put behind the spikes—far
from it. It is arguing that no man whose guilt has yet to
be proved should be placed there. “ Once accuse a
man of a crime and people will be ready to believe
him guilty. Place the most honest and pleasing face
behind these rails, and it at once becomes a face that
expresses every passion,” said Dailey on a memorable
occasion.

Ramornie Meat Works, Clarence district
(N.S.W.), now having ceased work for this season after
seven months’ active operations, put through 19,030 head
of cattle during that time. The output exceeds that of
any previous season, and the bulk of it goes to fill a
French army contract, said contract expiring in '97. The
meat-extract goes to Liebig, who puts it up in neatly-
labelled pots and sells it at 1600 per cent, profit. The
waste meat from which the extract is derived until re-
cently went to the pigs. As some hundreds of pounds of
extract are now made weekly, every lb. of which brings
65., it will be seen that the owners of these works are in
for a good thing out of waste products alone.

Melb. City Council, the other day, accepted a

There is a Chinese insurance co. in Sydney with
a comprehensive scope. It insures against death, acci-
dent, fire and marine losses, and there is a special clause
in its ideographed policy entitling the parents of the
insured to £3OO should he be hanged for killing a
European in self-defence, while £2OO is the recompense
given to the relatives of an ins ired Chow who is murdered
by a European. Also, the fortunate policy-holder is
entitled to receive £3 a week during incarceration for an
offence for which the insurance co. considers the bar-
barian beak has unjustly inflicted punishment.

The Amos G.M. Co. (N.S.W.)—The half-year’s

in 8.N.5.W., Sydney, £1 18s. 5d ; A.J.S. Bank, Blayney,
2s. 9d. The mine was let on tribute to one of the pro-
moters, who soon had the good sense to abandon it.
“ Before taking this course (to wind up) your directors
deemed it advisable to make an attempt to dispose of the
mine in London (the usual course) and with this view
applied for, and obtained, six months’ suspension of
labor-conditions, and also secured a report of the mine.”
The present co. to receive either £10,090 cash for the
whole mine, or £2OO cash and one-third of the shares in
any new co. fully paid up, “ present co. not to be liable
for any expense.” A wise precaution. Two-thirds for
£2OO (and shares), but £lO,OOO for the whole !

The chances are that already many a prospector
is cursing the Australian Star, which has been the means
of landing him in the Clarence River district. Has any
goldfield ever been found in Australia which would justify
the sensational statements made in these articles ? The
boom seems to have been written-up by the Star’s ship-
ping-reporter. Sydney Shipping News compliments the
writer of the sensation on his mining lore, and the Star,
with becoming modesty, reprints the par. The wild
statements in the article and the headlines about “a
mountain of gold,” &c., have caused numbers of men to
rush to the field. The Star man talks of a gold belt 150
miles long, of huge hunks of gold—“ one boulder of ex-
ceptional richness was sold for 395.” Most of the wonder-
fully rich things seem to have been found either on Mr.
Sain See’s selection or very near it. Great stress is put on
the information that the only route to Yugilbar, the
station on which the rich reefs are found, is by way of
Grafton—to which Mr. John See’s steamers run, by the
way. The present writer has been to the district twice, by
different routes, neither by way of Grafton. As to the
remark that a great mistake was made in landing the
Taylor’s Reward machinery at Woolgoolga(Coff's Harbor),
and that it also should have gone to Grafton : that would
have meant about 100 miles more sea-carriage and 50
miles by land, against less than 10 miles from Coff’sHarbor.

Experts representing mining syndicates, notably
from Broken Hill and Sydney, have hern testing the
reefs on Warrata and the Albert gold-fields, N.S.W., but
none of the shows have changed hands. A ton of stone
from the Brilliant lease, treated at Ballarat school of
mines recently, went 23dwts. It was bagged by Capt.
Langdon on behalf of a Broken Hill syndicate. The
leaseholders were offered £5OO for the property, but
refused. Welsh and party, on same line, had their first
trial crushing recently of 12 tons, treated at the local
battery. Result, 14>40z. Property considered one of the
best on the field. Other promising claims in the vicinity
of Welsh’s, but very little work done. The Warratta
(the original prospecting claim), assisted by a Melb. syn-
dicate to the amount of £2OOO, is systematically develop-
ing, and some rich specimens discovered. On Bendigo-
absurd to have another Bendigo !—S.E. of Warratta, the
most promising claims are Howes’ Reward, Western
Star and Carbine. Reef runs north-westerly with under-
lay east. Three crushings from Howes —25 tons for 60z.;
50 tons for 2140 z. ; 50 tons for 3oz. ; and 20 tons seconds
for loz. per ton. Adjoining the Western Star is the Black
Prince, which has had a trial crushing of 10 tons for a
return of to the ton. About 500yds. South on the
same line ofreef is the Carbine, 50 tons at grass awaiting
treatment. Holders say it will go 2oz. per ton. Charge
for carting and treating at the battery 355. per ton.
Nearest railwav to field is at Tarrawingee, 140 miles dis-
tant. Cost of'living, etc., 130 per cent, above Sydney
prices.

same old business—battery up, mine down ?

G. D. Meudell, on W.A. goldfields : —“ln two
things alone the Govt, has failed lamentably—in not pro-
viding water, and in blocking the railway from Esperance
Bay to Coolgardie. Eventually Esperance must get the
railway. ... A few influential funerals in Perth
would be a public boon just now. When the fields are
properly represented in Parliament, this national work
will be accomp’'-hed. After seeing W.A., one is not
quite sure whether to follow the banner of Briggs (Age)
or Daly (Argus). The former was correct in his strictures,
the latter accurate in his facts. The proper course seems
to lie between damning W.A. fields and damning them
with faint praise. This much one must put on record :
the amount of work, especially prospecting work, done is
stupendous. At Kalgoorlie a manager thinks nothing of
sinking four, five and six shafts on a lease, when in Tas.
or Vic. one would be considered sufficient. I expected to
count shafts by the half-dozen at Kalgoorlie, but found
them in fifties. The map gives but a faint idea of the
number of mines and the amount of work they are doing
both above and below. (Then where is all the gold ?)
Serious mistakes have been made in starting to treat ore
with imperfect machinery. . . . Add to this the
accursed over-capitalisation of British co’s, and one need
not be a prophet to predict that very few of the British
mines will pay divs. till Australians buy them from the
liquidators. W.A. wants patience and people. The gold
is there, and will talk for itself by and by.”

Broad Arrow, W.A., is about the only mining

Bayley’s amalgamation scheme, if ever perfected,
will not be very welcome to No. 1 South shareholders. It
is proposed to amalgamate the South and the Reward,
and the Browne and Lyon people are trying to run in their
two leases —Ford’s Hill and No. 1 North. The South, with
a capital of £120,000, is not much good as it stands, but it
is the only mine of the four which might pay dividends

good patch a while ago, but is not working on the

“An old engineer, a really practical miner, who
has recently seen the General Gordon, speaks of that
property as quite as good, if not better, than the Great
Boulder.” (Sunday Times tipster.) No doubt that is
the reason its shares have fallen over 50 per cent, during
the last few weeks. Of course, the public want a mine
twice as big as the Boulder for less than a tenth of its
price, and the market is never any indication of value !

Cabled that Lindsay’s Find Proprietary G.M.

of the duffer, also called Lindsay’s, near the town of Cool-
gardie, in reference to the floating of which the explorer
himself says he had nothing to do ?

From a W.A. reliable mining-man to the Bul-
letin : “ Nothing sensational in the way of mining to re-
port. Burbank’s, lam told, are raising stone superior to
anything they have yet had. Menzies crushings are
keeping up an average of two and three ounces. One or
two batteries will start at Black Flag shortly on good pay-
able stone. Some decent shows have been lately opened
up at Widjimoola, between Coolgardie and Norseman.
Hundreds of acres have been taken up by a knowing
crowd, and several purchases have already been made.
The day for ‘ wild-cats ’ has passed. Most of the Eng-
lish and foreign buyers here now want to see something
for their money. Pity that a more honest set was not
sent out in the first instance. The curse of the country
now is the enormous amount of money being lavished on
rank duffers.”

What has happened to the gold that was said to
be sticking out of the General Gordon lode awhile ago ?
The nearer the crushing, the lower the market-price of
shares in the parent mine. And all the pups seem to be
suffering from mange at present.
* * * *
Ed. Bulletin, —A recent par. re an historic
meeting of London shareholders fn a much-puffed mine
recalls a few incidents that occurred in connection with
the visits of experts during the flotation of that alleged
mine in London. A high official in the co. used to
accompany each expert down the mine, or round the
surface, as the case might be. The first to arrive was
a man who runs a paper on the field, and fancies his
knowledge of mining a bit. After inspecting the drive
and commenting on the reef, he remarked, “ Of course,
you will make this your main hauling-shaft ? ” “Yes,”
said the official. The shaft was 6x3. and on top of a
quartz-blow about 50ft. high 1 The next to come was the
chairman of a big land-syndicate—they hang upon his
every mining’ utterance in London. After the usual in-
spection of stone from a small leader on the footwall, and
one of the drives, he paralysed the official by asking where
the reef was. The official fell against the side
of the drive and gasped out, “ You are stand-
ing in it.” Accompanying this expert was another
who, on being asked if he was going below, replied that
he didn’t care about going down a shaft that anyone else
sank, but if he sunk it himself, of course, he would go
down the rope hand-over-hand. I afterwards heard him
pronouncing the concern a grand show, and enlarging on
the quality and size of the reef at the 100 ft. level, a place
to which he hadn’t the courage to go. The next to come
was a well-known red-headed personage. The manager
stepped on to the ladder and asked Mr. Coppertop if he
was coming down in the bucket. He said, “ Oh, no ; I’ll
take your word for what is below.” Fancy taking the
word of a manager for what was in a mine in which he
held a big interest! It was chiefly on the report of these
alleged experts that the mine was floated. —Tambo.

Sydney concern : “ Have put two men to costeen at

Ivanhoe: “ Splendid gold struck at the 300 ft.
level water-shaft. The stone is worth lOOoz. to the ton.”
But most of the mania having departed from the market,
speculators are waiting for the number of tons of this
sort of stuff. So far the market has not budged.
* * * *
The directors of the Great Boulder, according
to Z. Lane, than whom, now, there is no greater W.A.
mining authority in this world, and probably few in the
next., are going to sink the deepest shaft in W.A. —they
have ordered the manager to go down 1000 ft. “ Here we
are working,” writes a Bulletin correspondent, “ a strange
formation, carrying great gold. We are at all times in
great straits for want of water, and are all afraid to sink
for it, i.e., on the lode formation. Do the lodes penetrate
the harder country, which must exist below, or do they
not—that is the grand secret.”

stone broken was sent to the battery, and the recent rich
developments were not included.” No doubt, but the
result is not what shareholders, per medium of booming
newspapers, have been led to expect. First, the press is
used to boom, and afterwards to apologise for and to ex-
cuse disappointments.

It is stated in Melb. that a co. has held 269 aches
of auriferous land at Costerfield (Vic.) for five years with-
out fulfilling any labor conditions worth mentioning, and
for 12 months without fulfilling any labor conditions at all.
The Age adds that the matter having been brought to
the notice of the Minister of Mines, he has ordered the co.
to fulfil the labor covenants under pain of forfeiture. He
hasn’t forfeited the leases, as provided by the statute, you
observe, for what (if the allegation is true) constitutes a
glaring breach of the law—merely ordered the co. not to
break the law any more. Why not apply this principle all
round ? When a poor man is found stealing a blanket,
let the Chief Secretary write him a polite note on a huge
sheet of paper, drawing his attention to the fact that if he
goes on stealing blankets it will really be necessary to
prosecute him, dontcherknow.

Dear Bulletin,—ifo your “ Wild-Cat ” remarks
on assays as applied to mining prospectuses. There is no
doubt the assay system will always be a fraud. However,
here is a plan used for the last 10 years, which I have
found to work well. If in breaking quartz I wish to
know what it is like, after firing a shot and having cleared
away the rougher stuff, I gather up the smaller stuff from
the floor and for a guide simply pan it off, but for closer
work have it assayed. And, again, to try a paddock of
stone no better plan can be adopted than to make a dish-
ful from the very top of the heap, and try it as above.—
Tomingley.

In W.A. recently, an imported mining-manager
took charge of what he reckoned to be his claim, put on
a man, and worked it industriously for three months.
Then a wild-eyed prospector emerged from the ground or
the scrub demanding : “ What the bianky do you
mean by spoiling my show ? ” The manager then found
he had “made a bloomer”—and moved on. At latest
dates he was still moving on in search of his own particu-
lar plot.

Australia’s least extravagant Governors
(The Bulletin likes this way of putting it) live at
the extreme east and west of the continent. One
of them, the other day, wanted wine for Govern-
ment House, and wrote to several merchants
for quotations. A low fellow who had been
approached before calmly replied that he was
quite sure his firm could not supply anything
cheap enough ! The other Gov.’s experience of
“ this damnable democracy ” differs slightly. He
wanted a kangaroo to hop picturesquely about the
grounds of Govt. House, and, hearing of a man
who owned a very fine educated marsupial, wrote
and asked him to call. The Govt. House crowd
was delighted with the animal’s performance, and
V.R.’s representative was lured for once to in-
cautious enthusiasm. “I tell you what,” he said
to the proud owner, “I’ll give you a pound for

the kangaroo’s chain, and moved off the verandah.

Echuca (Vic.) was much distressed at the
thoughtlessness of its municipal authorities in not
offering a reception, “or any sort of welcome
demonstration, ” to Gov. Brassey and party when
they passed through the town last week. Barring
the railway officials and a number of school
children, there was nobody on the platform to
hooroo the vice-regal train on its arrival. Conse-
quently “Uncle Tom,’’after bowing gravely to the
porters and the children, took his wife for'a quiet
walk as far as the neighboring sawmills to fill in
time before resuming his journey. Local corres-
pondents of the Melb. dailies detected a sad
expression on His Excellency’s face, as though he
had reckoned on a glass of champagne and a bis-
cuit, and they seem to think that the Mayor and
corporation ought to be locked up for insulting
behaviour.

He would be glad if any teacher of the State schools
who feels so disposed would, to-day, one minute before or
a minute after regular school hours, write on the black-
board and permit as many children as are willing to do so
to repeat with him these words, or words to a similar
effect:—“Our Father which art in Heaven, grant that
our dear master and beloved friend, Mr. Hartley, may be
restored to health.”
As if the majestic God of the universe could be
expected to alter the course of Nature at the
behest of a number of mumbling school-children,
in the ostensible interests of a school-inspector.
Mr. Hartlev has since died.

A miserably - down-
trodden male named Suth-
erland is asking Welling-
ton (M.L.) Supreme Court
for relief without very
much success so far. His
story is that some years
ago he married his wife
Amelia, but after aiming
the dishes at each other
for two years they separ-
ated. Afterwards, shesays,
she heard that he was dead,
and she married Johnson,
and they had four child-
ren. Later on Johnson
died, and then the lady
says she heard that Suth-
erland was really alive,
and obtained an order in
his absence for alimony.
Now Sutherland requests
that the lady should be
compelled to hear that he
is dead again, or, at least,
that he shall be as dead
when she wants money
from him as he was when
she wanted to marry John-
son. He also points out
that he hasn’t had the
pleasure of the lady’s so-
ciety for many years, and
that he heard she was
dead, and that it would be
better if she was, and
asks the Court if he is re-
sponsible for Johnson’s
children. And the Court
has scratched a large bald
place on the side of its
head trying to decide if
the lady was quite sure
Sutherland was dead when
she married Johnson, that
being practically what the
whole question hangs on.
Query : What are the pro-
babilities that any woman
waits to be cpiite sure the
other man is dead before
she marries Johnson?
If Suffield really did commit the crime
charged against him, lie was even a more extraor-
dinary ruffian than represented last week. For
the road from Lambton turns past the house
where he lived ; and he might have waited for his
alleged victim at a score of convenient lonely
spots. Why he should let her pass him, then
dodge round in front to sit on the gates of the
house she lived in, and finally wait to attack her
until she was right home, and could holler for help
with the certainty of getting it at once, puzzles
mortal understanding ? Why didn’t he delay a
little longer, till he got her on the front-door mat ?

The allegation that new evidence is re-
quired in the Suffield case before an enquiry can
be held is merely a departmental fiction. N.S. W.
Criminal Law Amendment Act, under which an
enquiry is asked for, says nothing about new evi-
deuce. It says that a prisoner is entitled to

enquiry if “ any doubt or question arises as to his
guilt.” The matter of Suffield s guilt is crammed
with doubts and questions. And if the Act really
did demand new evidence, there is plenty of it—
as to the peculiarities of ex-Judge Windeyer, who
tried Suffield’s case. A great deal more is publicly
known of Mr. Windever’s temperament and
mental qualities than was known half-a-dozen
years ago, and the bulk of this added knowledge
makes the justice of Suffield’s conviction more
questionable than ever.
* *
In one way Suffield did himself harm at
his trial. His “ statement ” (it was before the
days of sworn evidence by prisoners) consisted of
a declamatory speech dwelling with some passion
upon the way he had been treated at the police-
court and the refusal of bail; and declaring that
he was one well-known wherever he "had lived to
be courteous and gentle towards women. He
seemed specially angry at the suggestion that he
could, as alleged, have thrown a stick or a stone at
prosecutrix, or used any violence towards her.
And, finally, he appeared to lose his head, and
wound up without saying any one of the things
he wanted to say re the fact that his clothes had
been examined by the police, and their spotless
state was incompatible with the charges. In con-
cluding, lie said : “As to this accusation, I spit
upon it ! ” All which, even though it may have
been a perfectly honest expression of indignation
at a false charge, produced a bad impression,

whereas the girl had made a good impression—as
girls so often do.
Judge Windeyer afterwards said that he had
closely watched Suffield’s demeanor and was sure
it was that of a guilty man. It does not, how-
ever, follow that because the Judge’s instinct was
right in the Dean case it was right also in the
Suffield case. For, as the world knows, Win-
deyerian instinct was sadly at fault in (for in-
stance) the recent Butler case.

Dear Bulletin,— Be Suffield being kept in
prison through-refusing to petition the Crown for
mercy, it may not be generally known that there
is a man in the debtors’ prison at Darlinghurst,
where he has been imprisoned for four years and
six months through refusing to file his petition in
bankruptcy. He was committed to gaol by Judge
Windeyer for non-compliance with an order for
payment of alimony to his wife. He can obtain
his freedom at any moment by simply filing his
schedule ; hut this he refuses to do, as he considers
the order made an unjust one, and nothing will
make him unbend. Unless Parliament interferes
I am absolutely certain that he will spend the
remainder of his life in gaol—or in the lunatic
asylum, to which his incarceration is fast driving
him. It appears the (alleged) Justice Department
can’t, or won’t, do anything to get the man
released.—H.B.

the local record verdict of .£2OOO and costs.
This trial was a raking-up of old, ill-founded
reminiscences, and the article was the pro-
duction of a Government messenger, who labored
under the delusion that the gallant captain was
dead. The efforts of defending counsel went to
try and prove that plaintiff was as alleged, but as
defendants had withdrawn their first plea of justi-
fication, counsel had to be constantly reminded
they were transgressing.

The “ Christian Endeavourers,” who were
allowed to disfigure with a cant phrase the engine-
front of the people’s train which brought them to
Sydney, and who in their holy fanaticism paraded
the city aggressively sporting the badge of their
weird clan, were a God-forsaken-looking lot if
God’s chosen are to be judged by appearances.
The excited faces of the gaunt, dowdy, flat-
chested women, aglow with that “ spiritual en-
thusiasm ” which would ride rough-shod over all
obstacles and force the Great Ter-uth on all sinful
outsiders, give a disagreeable shock to unemo-
tional persons, who stare and wonder at the mean-
ing of it all. The men, an unhealthy crew, badly
in need of exercise in the fresh air and sunlight,
most of them with weak eyes and wearing glasses,
and always surrounded by the women, whose
cloaks and gamps they carried.
TheEndeavourers could best be studied at Quong
Tart’s restaurant, between one and two o clock.
The wily Quong makes special terms for religious
bodies ; but a lot of the saints, not satisfied with
tea and scones at “cut” rates, demanded bread
and butter thrown in. As it was not in the bond,
the attendants charged extra, whereat the godly
wailed loudly at the pay-desk, settling under pro-
test, while some actually asked for receipts for the
amounts pending enquiry !
* * * *
Sydney Daily Telegraph seems to have
secured that rare bird, a holy reporter. Here are
some slabs from his description of the local
Christian Endeavour pow-wow. First, as to the
arrival of the saints from abroad :
From the carriage windows red and white bannerets
fluttered like lance-pennons in a cavalry-charge. Inside,
the Endeavourers’ song of recognition fills each compai t-
ment, and the strains float through the windows, and are
caught up by the eager watchers on the platform. Travel-
stained and weary, as they necessarily are, the visiting
Endeavourers have lost none of their spiritual enthusiasm.
Their eyes are bright, and their faces are radiant with
eager life. As they alight, their hands are grasped and
worthy words of welcome uttered, whilst the gentler
members, both visitors and welcomers, rush into that
embrace without which no function, spiritual or other-
wise, appears to be complete.
Yum, yum !
Mr. William White was leader of the prayer-meeting,
and fully 200 Endeavourers had torn themselves from com-
fortable couches to take part in devotional exercise. An
excellent tone pervaded the meeting. Prayers were
short, crisp and pointed ; the hymns were bright and re-

effect.

that the Endeavourers “were filled with the fire of

No one could listen to the stirring sentences of the Rev.

LOT’S WIFE UP TO DATE.
ONE CHAPPIE: “ I wonder if that girl I winked at just now is 'square'?”
ANOTHER CHAPPIE: “ Well—just after she passed, I saw her look round.”
During a recent visit of a Govt, inspector —
a doctor—to an Australian meat-preserving works
he “ cut down ” five tuberculous cattle out of a
mob of 70, and out of another lot of 118 he con-
demned nine! The question arises as to what
becomes of tuberculous beasts in the absence of
the inspector.

Dr. N. A. Cobb, of Sydney, a short time
back cut up the eatable part of three bunches of
nice-looking celery, as far as it was tender, and,
on washing the same, obtained nearly 300 thread-
worms, belonging to six different species. I hread-
worms include the Trichina, the parasite that
causes trichinosis, or pork measles ; Filaria, the
worm-parasite found in the blood of colored races;
and other wormy parasites of man.
The spirit of the
Inquisition still sur-
vives. In a country-
district a poor, hard-
working widow, wish-
ing to get the charge
of some boys from the
Neglected Children's
Department, applied
to her parish priest
for the necessary re-
ference as to charac-
ter. He refused to
give it, on the ground
that one of her chil-
dren was an atheist,
and bullied her for
bringing him up as
one. She forwarded
the letter and form
to her bishop, but re-
ceived no answer.
This sort of thing
helps to persuade one
that the Church and
a decent form of so-
ciety cannot possibly
co-exist. Given such
a spirit in such times
as ours, what were
the chances of that
supposed atheistic
son, nay, of the ortho-
dox mother herself,
in auto-da-fe epochs|?

Another item
(says a Bulletin cor-
respondent) that
helped to make St.
Patrick’s Fair, Melb.,
a success. Hearing
that the N. Melb.
faithful were arrang-
ing a fair for their own
church for about the
same time, Arch-
bishop Carr visited
them and said: “You
N. Melbourne people
help us with St.
Patrick’s Fair first,
and then we’ll come
and help you.” They
did so, and still
the half-finished walls at N. Melb. remain half-
hidden by huge advertising hoardings. Of course
his lordship did not say when he would come.

Barrister Lowers contributes a witty
article to the Vic. law students’ quarterly, the
Summons, on the drafting, passing and effects of
the Vic. Legal Amalgamation Act (said to
have been passed to give a prominent Vic.
boomster solicitor a leg-up for a judgeship). He
certainly voices the opinions of the junior bar,
but it is rather singular that the junior bar
couldn’t see the injustice of excluding W.A. solici-
tors from Vic. at the inception of the Act when
no Victorians wanted to go to W. A., while now
the Act is anathema, when the whole Vic. bar
wants to but can’t bolt into W.A. There s a sort
of poetic justice about the thing, that softens its
asperity in the eyes of laymen.

A Westralian station-master, resenting the
interference of Gov. Gerard Smith in a mattei of
railway management, told his Excellency, also
his Excellency’s aide-de-camp, to “go to h .
Maorilanders demand that Admiral Bridge
shall station his squadron in their waters for some
portion of each year, so that the M.L. girls may
have the advantage of meeting Ins officers, the
influence of the local New Woman ! Even her
large, splay-footed native policeman has palled on
her.
“Go to h—l!’’
The Gov. and the station-master
Were discussing a disaster,
Both their pulses beating faster
As their voices rose and fell,
When the'master of the station
(Not to say, the situation)
Breathed the sudden imprecation—
“ Go to h—l!
Go to h—l! ”
He cried in indignation—
“Go to h—l! ”
“ Go to h — l!’’
His Excellency dispersing,
Quite unfitted for conversing
With the man he’d left a-cursing,
Sent a hade-de-kongy swell
To demand an explanation
From the master of the station,
Who renewed his exhortation —
“ Go to h—l;
Go to h—l! ”
His sultry exhortation —
“ Go to h —l! ”
“Go to h—l! ”
They didn’t drop “ down under,
But' to Perth they rode in wonder,
Looking lilacker than the thunder,
So the daily papers tell,
Where they lodged an information
’Gainst that master of the station,
Which consigned him to damnation,
“ Go to h—l!
Go to h—l! ”
Inch-along in degradation
Down to ’ell !
“ Save the Gov. ! ”
’Tis the prayer of saint and sinner
At a loyal public dinner,
May his Nibs be crowned a winner
In the Land of Light and Love,
And when rulers grave and portly
Get an answer given shortly,
May it always be a courtly
“ Go above !
Go above ! ”
A gentle, dulcet, courtly
“ Go above !”

Dear Bulletin,— ls the preference by
Anglo-Saxon women for churlish men a proof of
superiority or of degeneration? It is generally
accepted that one of the signs of civilisation is the
deference displayed by men to women, despite the
tact that a marked resemblance between the
primitive woman and her more highly-developed
sister lies in their mutual contempt for excessively
courteous men. The whole tenor of George
Kgertons ‘Keynotes'’ bears out this. There
is a lot of sound knowledge of this feminine
trait in the navvy s advice to his mate : “Kick
hell out of her, Bill, and she’ll love you all the
, But wha t becomes of the lessons we had
stuffed into our innocent young skulls to be
always tender and courteous to women, seeing
that experience teaches us the contrary ? Tf oour-
tesy is a sign of a higher evolution of culture, are
not the I rench and the Japanese superior to the
Anglo-Saxons and Teutons? If, on the other
hand there is nothing inconsistent with high
development in this feminine preference for
brutes, then the most highly-developed woman
in history was the mythological lady who
mated with a bull. Is this apparent inconsistency
with the alleged tenderness of woman merely a
racial characteristic? Camille is made to fall in
love with Armand because of his non-aggressive-
ness, as also is Manon Lescaut.— C. J. Towell.

A WOMAN’S LETTER
~ Tl Sydney, Sept. 21, 1890.
My Dear Myee—
Randwick, as a dress-show, was fluttering and
breezy, clearly foretelling that summer-gowns are
to be built on “ ventilation gossamer ” principles.
Owing to the tropical weather, so fashionable in
London and Paris this summer, no end of frivolous
chiffons have been devised to be cool and comfort-
able in. While the thermometer in the head-
centres of style kept within bounds, we obediently
followed our leaders and sweltered in heavy velvets
and such, with a temperature over the century.
But when they tasted that sort of thing themselves
down under,” they gasped with horror, and now
perspiring womankind rejoices in coolth.
Grass-lawn is very much “in methinks we
are all going to be weary of that fabric. The
mere man might consider it a sort of glorified
brown holland, but let him wait till he has to foot
the bill ! Chine silks glistened on many of the
best-dressed at Randwick ; the colored blouse and
v s ¥ rt is too useful to be utterly
abolished, and still adorns many who ought to be
tired of it by now. Hats were huge and most
fantastic a Derby Day sensation was the nine
guineas worth of headgear adorning one of Syd-
ney s richest women. As an investment of capi-
tal it was a success, but as a tile it was a failure.
i\o hat could be pretty with all -that money in it.
Sydneys own vice - regalities dressed with
aggressive plainness all through. Lady Hampden
failed to respond to sartorial challenges, and
heeded not the most violent color-onslaughts on
the part of her subjects. The regal-looking Lady
Uormanston mixed blue with green in an up-to-
date gown. Gov. Brassey’s daughter-in-law tries
to model herself on “ Hop’s ” social-gimlet lady as
much as her youth and fresh looks will per-
niit; and will succeed in time, no doubt.
J best-dressed woman in Sydney,” Mrs.
Charles Fairfax, looked like a pretty, fuzzy
little I rench doll. Maxine Elliot loomed majestic
on the lawn ; she had a grass-cloth dress, a violet-
strewn hat, and her sister Gertrude. Mrs. W. R.
. llson exhibited several different costumes —all
in good taste. The wife of the only Melb.-made
bart. strove to look well-dressed, but—her dress-
maker had not helped her. The Madden girls
looked plump and apple-cheeked enough to satisfy
even pa himself, who has so often made public
confession of his adoration of the buxom. Ladv
understudied her youngest daughter,
i A. of Three” booms along much more
cheerfully than might be expected of a woman in
her depressing position* There is much original
light humor m Mrs. Brough’s frock-coat, and
when she forgets she hasn’t a lap and lets the
photos, drop between her knees the audience laugh
all they know how. Her three girls also keep up
their spirits wonderfully, considering that their
admirers are trying obstacles to meet with in life’s
common way—although Carey in a steward’s
jacket, Majeroni in a lobster shell, and Harry Hill
in a gaudy blazer, helped to make a pretty scene
in Act 11., in a room very girlily adorned with
ribbon-bows and odds and ends.
All the gowns are girly, like the room. Aquila
and Vesta robe themselves almost alike, while
Cassiopeia seems to go off “on her own ” and
tints. Winifred Austin,
the hydney amateur, is going to make an actress ;
she is vivacious and has an uncommonly effective
eyebrow-lift—theaverage player has about as much
expression m that part of her phiz as if she had
gummed a penny moustache over each optic. Lily
f itheradges pretty arms show out of her simple
sieeves m a nice sort of way. Sir Port and wife
upholster themselves quite appropriately as the
military swell and partner, and Miss Temple is
most artistically untidy as the slavey.
f iT h \ Cr i‘ d ,-°\ has ad the week been full of Melb.
folk who looked hard at each other and coughed
pensively when Mrs. B. delivered the stern moral
of the piece and apostrophised the Petticoat as
the source of all true feminine dignity and in-
fluence. Mrs Murgatroyd’s quailing before the
stony glare of the Medusa-like Port made each
secret hankerer after bloomers clutch metaphori •
cally at her skirts lest they should vanish utterly,
lor Melb. women are going in for-and into—
. the other things ” much more than their Sydney
sisters. Down South the bloomer-clad wheel-
woman is distinctly visible, but she—l supposeone
must still call her “she”—hasn’t yet shown up
much m Sydney. y
It is the bicycle that is doing it, of course. A
at dikes and bikeresses shows me
that the Sydney girl finds the pastime far, far from
£ a L , A woman can’t possibly be enjoying her-
self when she is painfully cramping her knees in
an impossible angle, grabbing at the handle-bars
like a drowning man at a straw, and propelling
herself about the country by a series of jerks and
wobbles-and she shouldn’t try and “ bluff” any-
body that she is enjoying herself. Some days ago
1 saw an energetic woman working her passage
along a suburban road in a high wind. She was
carrying her bike much more than her bike was
carrying her. With her hat firmly tied on with a
handkerchief, and an expression of craven fear on
her face she trundled along working her jaws
vigorously on a mouthful of chewing-gum. In
Melb. the ardent cycliste often throws aside her
prejudice and petticoats together and flies over the
smooth tram-blocks like swift Camilla o’er the un-
= m V orn - • B V t ? properly-built habit andl
slender figure m a high saddle enable the skirted
rider to defy criticism anywhere. Mind you I
said a slender figure. J 9
The gum-chewing habit seems spreading beyond l
cycling circles. Here and there in the theatres
a monotonous munching go on steadily
from act to act. Some women seem to like finish-
ing their dinner in the dress-circle. I would sus-
pect them of ham-sandwiches in a hand-bag, or
pork-crackling, only they are usually those to
whom the true inwardness of a ham sandwich is a
thing accurst. There is one point in favor of the
quiet chew—it stops chatter, and the dress-circle:
jaw now works entirely on the silent system.
. T hat wh ite satin gown of the Murgatroyd
girls, and the wild struggles of the society reporters-
to get it different each time it is described, recall
tae moan of a “leather of Daughters,” who writes
agitatedly to a Cooktown paper complaining that
the papers will describe his—and others’—daugh-
ters dresses at public gatherings; consequently,
the gowns get as “ lienspeckle ’ as their owners,
j e F lrls as^£ continually for more millinery to
the detriment of the family funds. “ Miss Mont-
morencx Johnson chose blue and green and looked
sweet to a degree.” There is a lot of poetry in a
line like that. The word “chose” brings up a
vision of a jaded faded lady’s maid humbly laying
the contents of a luxurious wardrobe before her
haughty mistress, who reclines on an easy chair
and capriciously lets her fancy lead her whither it
will among the shimmer and glimmer of satin and
pearls. In reality, the lady who looked sweet to
a degree has generally worked up the dress at
home herself, assisted by a seamstress at sweated
rates and meals-with-the-family.
. Walker, the Concord millionairess—even
m these hard times, she is credited with .£50,000
a year celebrated the racing-season by inviting
sassiety to meet together in the Exhibition,
a ' va ?t expense with crimson carnations.
All the pinks in Victoria and S.A. had been sent
up for the festival per train, and the ballroom was
one large and vivid blush. The hostess herself
helped on the effect by wearing brocade of an en-
sanguined hue, and the guests at supper fed in an
encarnadined glow that recalled the Terror sun-
sets in the Potter-Corday revolution. It was a
pity that the decorations could not have been re-
tained for another evening and a charity ball fixed
up, as then others besides the Nicest People might
have gazed at the gorgeousness. Miss Walker
who has given £3OO to send a quartette of N.S.W.
mounted riflemen ’Oine next yen' o display their
prowess before the eyes of royalty at the Islington
Tournament, will leave for the Big Smoke herself
m Eeb. next.
Juvenile Sydney gathered in force at Moore
lark on Friday and Saturday at the Public
School Athletic Association sports. Aspiring
Cornstalks swarmed over the grand stand and
grounds generally, hung enraptured over the
railings of the vice-regal pen, and discommoded
the Gov. by dropping peanut shells down his
neck. There was a miscellaneous show of assorted
sports going on altogether, like a made-in-Germany
toy with a windmill, a horse-race and a railway-
train, all wound up to go at once. Centipede-like
battalions of thin-legged small boys exercised
before His Ex’s eye, and hundreds of art-muslined
girls vigorously swung clubs and dumb-bells. The
1 orest Lodge school-girls, in Kate Greenaway
frocks, were the smartest at the Maypole dance.
Vast quantities of spindly black stockings were re-
vealed, enabling me to prophesy that the locally-
raised ballet of the near future will have to depend
on cotton wool for its calves.
The Society of Artists’dance for children hap-
pened at Ciiff’s rooms on Friday evening.
Crowds of infantile Jacks and Jills and Pagliacci
and cooks and shepherdesses processed solemnly
round the room under the guiding hand of Miss
1 heo. Cowan, watched some conjuring tricks, de-
voured much light refreshments, and went home
to dream of the hobgoblins and bogiemen sketched
for them by artists Souter and Mahony. The in-
nocent-looking Miss Mult was clad in white
muslin and a realistic spider, there were several
Chinatown girls and Jap. dolls, and an entire
family of both sexes came in the raiment of
Southern plantation coons. The microscopic leg-
gings of a Tom Thumb stockrider were very natty,
and a black fairy with elongated limbs looked
rather like a South Sea belle arrayed for a siva.
Among the “Miss Muffits ” and “ Gipsies ” at
:a fancy-dress ball it is rather hard to hud some-
thing that half-a-dozen other girls arc not wearing
also. At a recent shivoo in a somewhat tropical
region, a girl struck on something original—at least
the costume hasn’t been worn outside Eden. She
•decided to appear as “Foliage,’’and fixed upabodice
and fichu of Indian moss and skirt of long plan-
tain leaves. The robe was “ sweet to a degree,”
and the wearer was having a good time until the
greenery began to curl and wilt with the heat. Her
alarmed and resourceful mother took her hastily
outside and applied the garden water - pot,
which freshened her up again for a time.
On drying, however, the leaves shrivelled with
great rapidity, and in two minutes the girl had no
more visible foliage than an autumn oak. The
onlookers called aloud on her ma to take her away,
and the victim was conveyed home in a table-
cloth.
In order to vary the monotony of praise and
pool-scooping au naturel, the Christian Endeavor
Convention has been whooping up festive little
games of various sorts during the week. For in-
stance, a party of Endeavorers visited South Head
by moonlight. The worst of S. Head as an even-
ing resort is that the lighthouse rays have an. in-
convenient way of “stalking” a strolling couple
and shedding a sudden and embarrassing brilli-
ance on the proceedings. But, that apart, it is a
place where one may experience a refreshing time,
and the sightseers Arcadianly wandered hand-in-
hand about the cliffs, artlessly warbling hymns,
and settled themselves in pairs in secluded nooks
and corners, endeavoring to shelter themselves
from the wind behind large umbrellas. Same old
endeavor!
Farewell meetings for ten missionaries for the
China Inland Mission are to be held next week.
J he apostles will go and speak the Terruth among
a benighted and wholly-reluctant heathen com-
munity who will horrify the missionaries by chin-
chinning Joss and refusing to leave off when re-
quested. The extent to which the lady apostles
will shock all the conservative notions of Chinese
decorum by Western modes of dress and behaviour
is harder to calculate, owing to the difficulty of the
language, but it counts as a factor in the massacre-
raising. The unmarried woman—whether Protes-
tant missionary or It. C. nun—is abhorred by Celes-
tials as something against Nature, and it is an
uneasy feeling that the “ fankai ” may spread
celibacy among his womenkind which makes John
hate her so.
Amid “great enthusiasm,” the N.S.W. National
Guard has been formed, and now will only want
.Nellie Stewart singing a soprano song, and Elton
m a tight uniform, wnh black buttons down his
pants, to be a whole comic opera. At the School
of Arts meeting, ex-Premier Dibbs arose and care-
fully explained that the Govt, paid all exes, of
uniforms, rifles and ammunition, and then the
cheering became quite wild, and the meeting
settled down to the serious business of choosing
what it is to wear as a livery.
Men always have the best of it in this
world. Fancy any Government fitting out a
band of women for any cause whatever and
turning them loose in a dressmaker’s show-
room with a paternal smile and “wear what
you please ! ” J ust cast your eye over the costume
in which the gallant hundred are going to
nationally guard us : “ The tunic is scarlet, with
blue facings; the trousers blue, with white
gaiters ; headgear, a shako, with N.G. inscribed
in front.” A member of committee exhibited a
sample get-up, and then the meeting walked
round the exhibit and gave opinions that “it
wants a little taken up here, dear,” or “ much too
full in the gathers, love.” The uniform, as a
whole, was approved of, but, in a burst of patriotic
economy, the defenders of their country resolved
to be self-sacrificing and suppressed the gaiters.
W. H. Paling & Go. send a waltz, “ Broomlea,” by
Bessie King, a fine succession of crashing chords.
Sydney girls have a knack of turning out brisk
and tuneful waltzes, and “ Broomlea ” is the very
thing for the soulful young man at the p;ano at
the suburban dance.
( Smart audiences do not seem to find life in
Mizzoura” as exciting as the gilded saloons of
pleasure in gilt-edged and utterly untrue-to-life
dramas of the “ Camille ” and “ Tosca ” type, for
they do not rush to visit the idvllic village of
Bowling Green very eagerly. The weak spot in
the play is the principal female character. A
woman cannot look beyond her own “ fatal
beauty ” to find a cause for any trouble that occurs
generally is a weak character. And in this case
she is a snob as well. The magnificent Maxine is
rather too overwhelming as Kate Vernon. With
her surpassing physical attractions, she seems as
much out of place in the blacksmith’s parlor as
Venus of Milo with her arms on would look serving
m a ninepenny tea-room. The part is a misfit for
Maxine, but her gowns aren’t. They are simple
print and zephyr, but in them she looks queenly
even to massiveness. Her black hair is parted
a l K j brought down over her ears with a little blob
of hair over each temple. A vivid scarlet sun-
bonnet is the most noticeable feature of sister Ger-
trude’s performance. That really deliciously lazy
little Lizbeth is artistic even to having the pink
ribbons of her wedding-dress all carefully showing
the creases where they had been rolled up. She
could easily find a “ stiddy job ” after marriage
letting down that coat for Dave, especially at the
sleeves.
Among the Nicest People the latest craze is the
Zoo party. Led thither by Capt. Ferguson on
Monday in race-week, they studied zoology from
the living subjects at the Gardens, and drank tea
in tents erected for the purpose on the grounds.
Hie rich and liberal host (who had previously
largely contributed to the funds, now at a low
ebb) undertook all exes., and it was a very nice
party indeed. And now some people are grumb-
ling thatitis because the party-giverisan A.D.C.,
and said to have <£15,000 a year, that he is
allowed to swell the receipts for one afternoon by
treating his friends to a gratis sight of the monkey
cages, and standing the racket every time they
want to hear the lion roar. The above “ some
people ” indignantly declare that, in some way,
the “ Rocks push ” are being deprived of their
rights as citizens when Zoo parties are given.
But when you come to think of it, there is abso-
lutely no reason why the “ Rocks ” or any other
push shouldn’t go and do likewise. It would
increase the gate, and cause a big rise in the flour-
trade, if they went and fed the bears with buns
when the Nicest People are surveying the
menagerie.
A club with a side entrance ” is considered
useful from a man’s point of view, and very likely
if men associates roll up in large numbers to the
(*' \\ Sidney Ladies C lub they will explain where
the convenience comes in. The ladies are wel-
coming men to the new club now in course of pro-
motion—but men don’t welcome women to their
clubs ; in fact, a man’s definition of a club is “ a
place where you get away from women.”
Two of the three big Sydney clubs only open
then' doors to women once in a blue moon ; the
third is never entered by petticoats at all. When
woman gets her club she will be less exclusive.
Hitherto the average woman’s club has consisted
of a puff-box, a tea-pot and bread and butter. The
new club seems to want man as a sort of sandwich.
Writes my Melb. correspondent :
“ Lord Richard Neville, acting as private-secre-
tary to Gov. Brassey in place of Wallington
departed, has managed to get himself seriously
dishked by at least one Melb. pressman. It seems
that the hireling scribe called upon R. Neville for
some every-day morsel of vice-regal intelligence,
and was told in effect to wait outside on the mat
until Ins lordship should be pleased to whistle for
him. At which the baffled interviewer took offence
and went away to swear, instead of stopping* to
swear on the premises. He was foolish in remov-
ing his indignation whilst it was hot. Neville
doesn’t look as though he had ever heard any bad
language of importance, so a whiff of bitter impre-
cation from an evening journalist might have
blown his fragile form back to England.
Ihe orrible tale of the Sydney victim who
tried corrosive sublimate for her freckles, and
shed those blemishes along with her skin, recalls
the experience of the Gippsland (Vic.) man whose
hair came off holus-bolus in his hand after an
application or two of Yankee color-restorer.
Nevertheless, for the sake of our national looks,
enlightened face-massage should be encouraged in
Melbourne, where, as globe-trotters tell us, the
prettiest faces are marred by frowns and conse-
quent crows’-feet—the effect of the city’s glare and
gritty dust. Judging by the congested condition
of the lift-traffic, one such establishment, near the
Collins-street entrance to the Block, already wages
vigorous war with the thorns in the facial flesh of
a fashionable clientele.
“ Cleanliness and friction, plus a holy horror of
chemicals and make-up, are the cardinal doctrines
of the scientific face-masseur. All the beauty-
men of the last visiting English cricket eleven
swore by face-massage. And well they might !
Their healthy, brown complexions and sleek, un-
lmed faces won them feminine admiration by the
ton, unlike their opponents, who ran the whole
gamut of objectionable complexion-shades from
leathery yellow to black, and seemed to wither up
under the sun’s rays for want of cutieular sap.
Crov. Hopetoun, glowing from the hands of his
masseur, was not a ruddy young man, but a week
up country, beyond coo-ee of his rubber, left him
as limp and sallow as a played-out yellow kid-
glove.
‘ r I he coming Mayor of Melbourne means to cut
an unprecedented dash during his term of office,
and already the future potentate has begun to
make many preparations to that end. He is spend-
ing money upon alterations and additions at his
private residence, situated near the city, so that
some of the more select ‘ functions ’ may be held
there, m a somewhat garden-party form! Mean-
while, the mighty host that is to be has not made
an absolute certainty of the billet.
Warblesoine Lord Shaftesbury, according to
the report of some people, who probably invented
it, says he is off ‘ Home,’ heartily sick of trying to
please everybody (without success) at Melb. Govt.
House. All the same, he professes a strong attach-
ment to ‘ bush life,’ and declares that if he had the
capital to spare he would invest it in a station and
be a real Australian squattah.
( Since the Melbourne sassiety performance of
I he Parvenue,’ a number of aspiring Philistines
who paid their three half-crowns for a chair in
Lady Clarkes ball-room have learned to sav
, Good-neigh-t ’ (night), Svaife’ (wife), ‘heali/
nevah, and so on, with quite a propah accent.
Anything of that sort can be learned if you give
your apology for a mind to it.
“ The most remarked features at the Mayor of
Melbourne s recent hop were a parson in dress-suit
and simple worldly cravat, and a number of gaudy
gallant defenders. These latter excited frequent
curses by wearing spurs which wrought much
mischief, tearing gowns and even trousers. In
one case a iriajah, or a capting, managed to drive
ins precious boot-ornament into a pretty girl’s—
ahem ! —leg, and the victim had to retire to the
dressing-room for sticking-plaster.
Austral Salon is making efforts to re-capture
the fairly-“ cultured ” essence which used to flavor
its earliest assemblings. Meetings now are run on
afternoon-tea-and-a-little-music lines. Within 30
minutes after opening the room is crammed and
ventilation nowhere. “Bringing a friend’’ has
spread to such proportions that two committee-
members now keep the gate and vigorously de-
mand a sight of paid-subscription tickets.
“The Brasseys and the Clarkes are ‘thick.’
Everyone remembers the jealousy between Mrs
Hopetoun and Mrs. Clarke, and the final good-
riddance kiss publicly administered at Spencer-
street station on the departure of the high-spirited
Governoress. But Mrs. Brassey and Mrs. Clarke
have much in common, including maturity of age
and a hankering after well-advertised benevol-
ences.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.

If the name be any criterion, the rule
appointing only Englishmen to R.C. bishoprics in
Maoriland has been broken through, Father

A Westralian patriot tells an Imperial
Governor to “go to hell,” and is abused for his
disloyalty. Rubbish ! the man is obviously only
a loyal citizen anxious for a further extension of
British influence.
Odd, or perhaps not, that the obituary
advt. of Knight Verdon omitted all his titles,
being simply “George Frederick Vernon.” As
with Graham Berry—casting his titled slough to

At the sale of Parkes’ books a “Slang
Dictionary,” which can be bought new in Sydney
for 3s. 6d., fetched 12s. 6d. And, judging from a

Cardinal Moran considers it impudence and
insolence for Anglican Bishops in Australia to
sign “ F. G. Melbourne,” “ S. S. Sydney,” or “J.
R. Adelaide,” and then he claps a big cross in
front of his own humble _monniker.
The unrelenting way in which old Francis
Longmore has waged war against Victorian land-

A well-known Western Vic. doctor, who

The father of “ Mystery-of-a-Hansom-Cab ”
Fergus Hume died the other day in Dunedin
(M.L.), of which city Fergus is a native. Hume
p'ere, a physician, was a mental specialist, and,
after a long experience in hospitals, established a
private asylum of his own. He passed away full
of years (73) and good “copy,” leaving, besides
Fergus, a son, now civil-engineering on Westralian
fields, and three daughters, the youngest of whom
(Mrs. Willeby Hawthorne) is getting noticed in
London as a soprano.
Anarchist Andrews has on the stocks a
magnum, opus in the shape of a poem of 120 pp.
or thereabouts, in Miltonic blank verse. The sub-
ject may be perhaps best described as “ Rag-
narok.” The title is “ Apollyon.” He has finished
writing it, and, with his indomitable energy in
the face of what, to ordinary men, would be im-
possibilities, he is slowly printing artd stereo-
typing it with what he calls “ a home-made
stereotyping plant.” Poverty, deadly sickness,
social ostracism seem only, in his case, to be
stimulants to great work.
THE GOLDEN WEST.
SON (who has a craving for information): “Say, dad, what makes the sky so yellow this evening?”
THE OLD MAN “ Oh, probably they're opening-up another phenomenal Westralian gold-mine.”
Millionaire Gray, who lately died in Ade-
laide, aged 89, claims to have built the first house
in that city. Its roof was of reeds, and the rafters
and other timber came from the scrub near by. He
is believed to have saved legacy-duty by splitting
up his property among his grand-children, the
progressive succession-duty in S.A. being collected
on the individual bequest, and not on the total
estate.
The re-marriage of
ex - Governor Bowen,
now well on to 80, illus-
trates the juvenility of
feeling and fancy sooften
found in dilettanti lit-
terateurs. The man who
has to scribble for bread
or who believes he has
a literary mission may
wear his brains to shreds
and dies like the average
of his race, but the self-
complacent book-loving,
book-making literary tri-
fler remains green and
sappy when the rest of
his generation is fit only
for firewood. Fifty years
ago Bowen presented
himself as an author, not
in any aggressive mood
or with a pretence that
the public demanded
anything from him, but
purely as a small mark of
respect for everybody.
When affairs were
gloomyin Queensland he
filled up his time there
as Governor inseribbling
couplets and stringing
commonplaces together
under the name of his-
tory. His hobby was to
dress his acquaintances
with Greek titles and
compare them with clas-
sical prototypes. His
then wif-j was a Greek,
and tuo branches of her
maiden name—Diaman-
tina and Roma—he fixed
indelibly on the Queens-
land map. But he was
always young, always
self-complacent, always
fond of book and pen,
and whatever breaks
came his way he was always ready to begin life
anew. Also, he always deeply admired the fair
sex, and, as Melbourne knows, had a distinct
preference for the Titian-red variety.
Working at a (Vic.) suburban stone-quarry
and crushing-yard are a baronet, a sth Wrangier
(Cambridge), the heir to an earldom and an ex-
major of Royal Artillery. The owner expresses
himself as “ ’aving a sort o’ likin’ for toffs.” He
“ allers gives ’em a show,” as he “ was a toff his-
self, oncet on a time, down Vitechapel way.”
Premier Seddon is alleged to be gradually
collapsing. Like Turner, of Victoria, Seddon is
“a terror for work,” and is Premier, Treasurer,
Minister for Works, ditto for Defence, and ditto
for Native Affairs all in one. As a result, “the
once bright countenance is growing haggard and
weary-looking, the bulky stature becomes more
shaky every day, and the frequent occasions on
which he is confined to bed are unmistakeable
signs of a physical break-down.” Seddon has
made no money out of politics, but then no reason-
ably honest man ever does.
Chief Justice Darley and new-Justice
Cohen seem to echo one another’s legal opinions on
the N.S.W. Bench. Simpson and Manning keep
well together in general views, and Stephen loves
to go alone.
Ballington Booth, the rebel son of his
father, is reported to have joined the Presbyterian
Church in Chicago. Why not revert to the ori-
ginal family business of pawnbroking? A pious
“ uncle,” who charged not more than 20 per shent,
would fill a long-felt want.
Pastor Fitchett is (said to be) annoyed
over the authorship of his Argus apotheoses of
slaughter, “Deeds that won the Empire,” tran-
spiring. Yet Stead has been cracking them up.
As Vincent Crummies says, “ It is surprising how
these things get into the papers ! ”
When Frederick Sargood bestrode a fiery
steed, at a recent review, a scurrilous rag essayed
to describe him as the Hero of the War Horse,
but, somehow, the phrase read Hero of the Ware-
house. _ Sargood is said to have been dissuaded
with difficulty from bringing the printer up before
the Bar of the ’Ouse.
King O’Malley, the windy Yank, who is
always “ hurling ” large masses of the dictionary
at his fellow-members, recalls Pat Coglin, who sat
in S.A. Assembly years ago, and once voted for
free newspaper postage because of “ the inex-
plicable delight with which people read these beau-
tiful dictatorial literary documents ! ”
Frank Cates had a famous grandmother,
Lady Charlotte Bacon—the “lanthe” to whom
Byron dedicated his “ Childe Harold.” She lived
to a great age, and visited these parts some years
ago. Melb. Govt. House was a haunt of Cates’ in
the Lochs’ days; he was connected with that
dynasty through his mother—a Villiers.
Mr. James Martin, ex-M.P. (N.S.W.),
bought at auction, at the recent sale, nearly all
the personal jewellery of Henry Parkes and his
first and second wives ; also, much of the presenta-
tion-plate, trowels, and mallets, and the big
Broken Hill silver spade, presented on the occa-
sion of turning the first sod of the B.H. water-
works.
The statement that Tynan was lying drunk
in bed, when the police burst into his room,
sounds very like a newspaper embellishment in-
tended to bring Oirish “patriotism” into disre-
pute. The Drunken Dynamiter and his Deluded
Devotees. A Boomster on the Burst. Tynan
takes care of Number One, &c. &c. Good head-
lines for the London hevenink papers.
All the obituaries of the late George
Verdon, C. 8., K.C.M.G., omitted mention of his
first job in Victoria, when he sold shirts in a small
outfitter’s shop in Williamstown, button-holing
the passing seamen in the genuine “ Vanter buy a
veskit ” fashion. After a time young Verdon
showed such business aptitude in seducing the
hardy salts into purchases of Crimean apparel that
he was offered a billet in a local shipchandler s,
which he filled with credit. The tidings of his
prowess in the realms of commerce soon travelled
to Melb., and Verdon ultimately became shipping-
clerk in Grice Summer’s, at which point the great
dailies take up his biography.
James Anderson Hartley, head of S.A.
Education Department, died in Adelaide If
of the results of a bicycle accident. Tireless,
brainy, enthusiastic —he was a born d'oniime. He
initiated in 1875 the present S.A. Public-schou
system and lived to see it reach the democratic
ideal—free, secular, and compulsory. He was for
ever proud of his victories over the Tory crowd lr
the early days, who, led by the Register, damnec
him and all his works. Was independent because
he was fairly wealthy, and in no fe£r of being
“unemployed”; there are many good stories
extant of his reception of meddlesome politicians
and ministers. Hartley died at the age of 52.
Henri Kowalski, the brilliant pianist and
composer, whose farewell concert occurs this
(Saturday) evening, is the fruit of two emigra-
tions—on the father’s side, Polish, on the mother s.
Irish. As both the nationalities which meet m
him are most musical, and possess a literature of
music more profoundly pathetic than any other
national music, except, perhaps, that of the negro—
to whom the future of music belongs, according ti-
the great Dvorak —it is not surprising that Kowal-
ski took to music as a duck to water. Young Kovt-
alski was a choir-boy in the Madeleine Chapel, and
sang there at the marriage of Napoleon and
Eugenie. He belonged to the opera chorus
between ’53 and ’57, and, at the same time,
studied in the Conservatoire, He began his
career as pianist and composer in Paris, and made
a great success with a little composition callec
“La Premevere.” Since then his compositions
are numberless, and one, the “ Marche Hongroise.
has had perhaps a larger sale than any other mus>-
cal composition published. The lucky publisher,
who bought the copyright for £2O, gave his
daughter a marriage dot of .£BOOO from the first
profits. The M.H. has been pirated in all countries,
and strummed on thousands of pianos by millions
of fingers to hundreds of millions of ears. Kowae
ski has composed operas, oratorios, piano music,
cantatas, concerts, orchestral pieces. With our
Marcus Clarke he did “Moustique,” a comic-
opera which very nearly hit the bull’s - eye
“ Moustique ” was first produced in Brus-
sels at the Royal Alcazar Theatre in 1883,
translated into French from Marcus Clarke's
libretto. Kowalski has the Chopin tradition
direct from the great but melancholy master's
pupils, Fontana and the Princess Marcelling
Czartoryska, and few players now alive can inte?
Sret the ethereal Polish pianist’s works like
iowalski. He has played all over the world, always
with greatsuccess, before courts and princes, and be-
fore history-makers like Bismarck (at Biarritz in ’67
He visited the United States with Madame Pate;,
Faure (baritone), Madame Carvallho, the creatrie*
of Marguerite in “ Faust,” and Naudin (tenor-
all great names. Played, too, with Hans von
Bulow, the son-in-law of Lizst and former
husband of Madame Wagner, who, Kowalski
relates, on producing one of Wagner’s com-
positions in Philadelphia, put on the programme,
“offered by the brother-in-law of the composer.”
After a tour of the United States with the
great Sarasate he returned to France during war-
time and was nominated to Leprowski’s con*
while the country was still in a state of defem -

Under the auspices of M‘Mahon, Kowalski gav*
concerts in aid of the wounded and raised >£6oliL
He was decorated with orders, which he neve-
wears, but which would astonish the C.M.G.*
and make the K.C.M.G.’s green with envy. Was
the first Commissaire-General appointed in Francs,
with Victor Hugo and Louis Blanc, to the
French National Fete in 1879. Kowalski ha.-
played in Sydney at 170 charity concerts, anc
deserves to have his own benefit a bumper. He
has created a distinct school of pianoforte with a
direct apostolic succession from Chopin himseli.
His pupils are legion, and Europe is full of them.
Socially he is the soul of wit, enjoyment, and elo-
quence. Iks strongly resents being asked to play
in social gatherings ; the writer of this has found
it best to throw open the piano and let nature take
its course. This stratagem has never been known u>
fail. Kowalski was correspondent for Figaro..
Paris, during the Melbourne Exhibition, and is
author of a book, “A Travers I’Am erique,” which
had a good sale. Was conductor of the Sydney
Philharmonic and gave the “ Mary Magdelene
by Massenet for the first time, and the “ Spectra
Bride,” by Dvorak. He engaged Madame Melba
to sing in the “ Messiah ” in March, 1885, the only
time she sang in oratorio here.

The Primate has addressed the following circu-
lar to the Anglican clergy on the subject of reli-
gious instruction in public schools:—“Rev. and
Dear Sits —The time has come round for me to
urge upon your attention and sympathy the work
of special religious instruction in public schools,
as carried cn by the committee appointed for that
purpose. The report presented to ilie' Synod at
the recent session, whilst indicating encouraging
features of the work, records a debit balance of
£T7 p>» Dd, and points to the offertory as an op-
portunity for the members of the Church at large
to contribute small sums. ' I therefore Invite you
and your churchwardens to give us, without fail,
the proceeds of at least one offertory, and I
would suggest Sunday, October 4th, or some other
Sunday in that month, as may be convenient to
you If a complete offertory cannot be spared,
.will you cause a special appeal'to be made, and
allow a definite proportion of .it,\ say one-half or
one-third, to be devoted to the work. Or, if you
prefer to do so, will you distribute amongst the
members of your congregation small envelopes,
duly endorsed, and request that offerings may be
made in them on any Sunday in' October. This
plan is suggested with a view of; minimising the
effect upon your regular offertory.—l am, etc..

Helpless upon a Friendless Sea!
Who, in taking passage upon a great oceanic
steamer, does not feel a thrill of exultation over
her magnificent power. Against her the Storm
King may hurl his elemental forces, nor pierce her
armour, nor stop her onward course.
But let me describe a scene when, one morning
in mid-ocean, the came an alarm from the pilot
house followed by a cry : “ The ship’s rudder is
lost!” From the confident expression, con-
sternation came to every face. The wheelman
being helpless to direct her course, the vessel was
at the mercy of wind and wave.
The captain had been negligent—the hangings
of the rudder were allowed to wear weak, and
suddenly it had dropped deep into the sea !
Strong in intellect, in physical vigor, in energy
and in ambition, man confronts, undaunted, gi-
gantic tasks and commands applause for his mag-
nificent achievements. But, all unexpectedly, an
alarm comes —the rudder of his constitution is
gone. He has been careless of its preservation ;
mentalstrain, nervous excitement, irregular habits,
overwork, have destroyed the action of his kidneys
and liver. This would not occur were Warner’s
Safe Cure used to maintain vigour. And even
now it may restore vitality to those organs and
give back to the man that which will lead him to
the haven of his ambition. — The Traveller. #

POLITICAL
POINTS
Last financial year the S.A. Govt, only got
£34,066 probate and succession duty, but this year
the Treasurer, after observing the age and physi-
cal condition of local capitalists, looks for £60,000.
N.S.W. Opposition-leader Lyne at Qui-
rindi : “I favor a land-tax, but would allow the
producer some profit to enable him to pay the
tax.” Lyne’s colleague, ex-Treas. See, at Yass :
“If I am a member of the next Ministry I will
repeal the land-tax.” Both utterances in the one
month !
Gov. Hampden’s refusal to attend the
Eight-Hours celebration at Rosehill arose, no
doubt, from his misunderstanding the significance
of the,onting ; but until the wurrkin-man learns to
enjoy his own special holiday in a workmanlike
way, without the meaningless patronage of Govt.-
’ouse, he will be always in danger of being similarly
misunderstood.
Premier Reid alleges that lie
was perfectly justified, on Freetrade
principles, in giving the famous Gun-
dagai bridge contract to a N.S.W.
contractor at a higher rate because he
was a local man, and thus making the
province pay for assisting local in-
dustry. “Freetrade,” says G.H.R.,
“ means free choice. We had a free «
choice in the case under notice, and we
exercised it.” Then, supposing the
N.S.W. Government freely chose to
shut out foreign imports altogether ?
Freetrade means free choice, and free
choice practically means liberty to do
anything. On G. H. Reid’s version
of the matter, a 500 per cent, tariff,
imposed by the free choice of G. H.
Reid, would be Freetrade. That is
just it: anything done by a party
that calls itself Freetrade, and lives
on alleged Freetrade, is Freetrade.
‘‘ Turncoat Bill ” Copley has not pleased
S.A. Oppositionists. This and another circum-
stance accounts for the rumor that John Downer,
whom he deposed, will succeed him. The task of
leading the assorted crowd composing S.A. Oppo-
sition is a thankless ope, anyway.
Montmartre :—No wonder the authorities
want to get rid of the Yarra-bankers. The man
still holds forth there who, at the red-flag Sunday-
afternoon pitch, advocated hurling Gov. Hope-
toun into the river. On the same occasion he said,
“ I hear glorious news, friends—the death of that
dog Maeßain.”
N.S.W. National Ass brays wildly to Leg.
Bouncillors to kill or emasculate the Factories
Bill. China, Japan, and N.S.W. are now about
the only manufacturing countries without Factory
Acts, and if N.S. Wales isn’t quick about it she
will be left alone with China, as J apan is hope-
fully considering the matter.
As there seems to be an Irish conspiracy
and dynamite atrocity boom now starting, non-
bigoted and impartial Australians should insist on
being supplied with a better press cable-service
than that which their daily newspapers provide.
The press cable-business is now practically a
monopoly, the news-items all filtering through one
channel; and what that means is obvious.
Dalrymple, Minister for Public Instruc-
tion, maintained vehemently in Bananaland As-
sembly the other day that all attempts to fix
wages by legislation were utterly futile and
impossible. Whereon Dunsford, M.L.A., ejacu-
lated : “ Don’t you fix them in your department ? ”
To which Hoolan added : “ And didn’t we fix our
own?” Whereat the gentlemen who had just
assessed their own value at £3OO per annum
laughed heartily.
Queensland has passed its own particular
kind of Federation Bill, and though it isn t very
like that of the other provinces, still it brings
Queensland, N.S.W., Victoria, S.A., and Tas-
mania into a sort of staggery line. Its goose-
step is woefully out of perspective, it is true, but
still it professes to be a line, and it is more like
one than a rainbow. As Westralia, apparently,
isn’t going to move, the other five provinces will
probably go on without her, and 'the election of
convention delegates is talked of for Nov. or Feb.
or thereabouts.
After all, it will be desperately hard luck
if there isn’t another N.S.W. surplus next year.
G. Reid has an artful dodge up his sleeve. This
year the 12 months’ land and : income taxes are to
be collected in one instalment. Next year they
are to be levied in two instalments, and the first
one will be collected before June, so that 18
months’ land and income taxes will appear in one
year's revenue. With 18 months’ tax in one year
and some of the diminishing duties still in force—
the last of them doesn’t cease to yield revenue till
1900 —there should be hope.
In answer to a question in Parliament,
Vic. Attorney-General Isaacs said that Crown
briefs were allotted to “ poor but competent bar-
risters.” It seems to strain such a category to
include in it a Queenslander whose practice has
been such as to have caused him once to have
refused a judgeship.
Pressure is being applied to Jacob Gar-
rard, N.S.W. Education Minister, to make him
induce the Premier to begin Leg. Assembly busi-
ness with prayer. Prayer has maintained its place
in the Commons, because members in time for
prayer have a choice of seats. The holy blather-
skite who proposes prayer for N.S.W. Assembly
will have to tack on some similar advantage.
The N.S.W. Old-age Pension Committee
reckons the number of necessitous people over 60
and qualified by 15 years’ residence in the pro
vince at about 4COO. Kirton, M.L.A., who has
taken up the question in Victoria, reckons there
are in that province 15,000 people above 60 in poor
circumstances. If the figures are much the same,
which seems probable, in N.S.W., it appears a
large order to assume that only 4000 will establish
claims on the pension-fund.
Bathurst (N.S.W.) has started a shriek on
behalf of its claims to be the Federal capital.
Bathurst has evidently heard that the Federal
city ought to be “ central,” and being more or less
central, so far as N.S.W. is concerned, it reckons
it fills the bill. There are now three N.S.W.
centres —Sydney, Albury and Bathurst —setting
up as the Federal metropolis, and there are
rumors of Goulburn chipping in, and not one of
them seems to consider that any other province
can possibly be in the running.
HE KNEW.
1ST CYCLIST : “Splendid weather for the roads.”
2ND CYCLIST : “ No—makes ’em too bloomin’ ’ard.”
Iminigration logic from Bananaland As-
sembly : “ Every new colonist contributes £6 16s.
4d. in taxes to public revenue, and is governed at
a cost of £4 15s. 10d., leaving a balance of £2 os.
6d. Wherefore 10,000 persons immigrating mean
an increase in revenue balance of £20,000.”
Wherefore also the introduction of 1,000,000 pau-
pers, drunks, Chows, Hindoos, signifies also
£20,000,000 in the colonial treasuries, and peace
and prosperity for ever and ever—Amen !
Beni. Hoare, an Age leader-writer, has
raised the ire of Max Hirseh by publishing a Pro-
tectionist leaflet entitled “ A German Invasion.”
Max says he is libelled, though not mentioned by
name. The concluding sentence :
The prop of all national life is industry. The man who
will imperil local Industry in order to promote foreign
Trade is always either fatuous or false ; and when he
employs German gold to desolate Australian hearths and
homes, he is a creature which the national stomach
should expel as vomit.
“FARE, PLEASE.”
SALVATION LASS (whose lad is on top of ’bus): “ You’ll get my fare Above!”
CONDUCTOR (unsaved): “ Very sorry, miss—but I can’t wait till I get THERE.”
Vic. Government as a sweater. It lias
accepted a tender for cutting a track from Clark -
ville toward Bendoc at A 5 3s. 4d. a mile. The
departmental estimate was Al 3 a mile for a nine-
mile track, i.e., =£ll7, on the basis that it would
take three men 17 weeks to do the job, or £2 6s.
a week per man. But, at the accepted £5 3s. 4d.
per mile, for 17 weeks’ work each man would get
,£l5 10s. as his share on the buttygang basis. And
yet politicians aver that there is no need for a
legislated minimum wage.
Victoria badly needs to adopt the Maori-
land system of buying up large estates and cutting
them into small aveus for farming settlement, either
on the leasehold principle, or as freeholds with a
law limiting the amount of land to be held by
one owner, so that the small areas won’t be
swallowed up to make more big estates. The
big squatting estates matter comparatively little
as yet in N.S.W. and Queensland where popula-
tion is thin, but the Cabbage-Garden has nearly
four times as many people to the square mile as
N.S.W., and 22 times as many as Queensland, and
already her people are beginning to slop over into
the adjacent provinces from sheer want of avail-
able soil. The enormous prices paid for agricul-
tural land in Victoria prove that the land-famine
has already set in. North-western Vic. is badly
watered ; the east is mostly a mass of mountain
ranges difficult of access, and the big landholder
occupies altogether too much of the fertile Central
district, and blocks progress.
The latest theory is
that Sultan Abdul-Hamid is
a homicidal maniac, and that
the Armenian atrocities and
other horrors are a natural
result of his malady. The
House of Othman has been
pretty bad in its head for a
long time. The last Sultan,
Murad, fell into idiocy and
disappeared—no one really
knows whether he is dead or
alive. Abdul-Medjid, of the
Crimean War period, was a
mild and cranky melancholica
with a strain of weak genius
in him somewhere, and a
feeble desire to die and be
a whitewashed saint in a
better land. Before him a
long procession of casual
Selims and Solymans were
more or less demented, right
back to the days of Amurath
the Terrible, who was a
mixture of the hero and the
melodramatic butcher, and
Selim the Sot, who was a
fat, hilarious lunatic of the
public-house variety. Bar-
ring its one great genius,
Mahmoud 11., the Othmans
can scarcely be said to have
been quite right in the head
for two centuries.
John Forrest’s W.A.
Estimates show he doesn’t
know how to waste the sur-
plus boodle quickly enough.
Here are some choice items :
“Police stations and quar-
ters, £85,500 ; Government
House, A 725 0; furniture for
public railways, £12,700;
gaols, £8790 ; industrial
schools, £40,000.” Except-
ing water, the great, glaring
want of W.A., according to
Forrest, is plenty of accom-
modation for bobbies, burg-
lars, and unattached babies.
Agent-general Playford,
who is anxious to resume
politics, has definitely de-
cided to return to S.A. next
year. Treas. Holder is con*
sidered a certainty for the Agent-Generalship.
If the Vie. One-Adult-One-Vote Bil 1
becomes law it will probably —even though it only
applies to the Assembly —make things more or less
sultry for the Upper House. It will necessarily
lead to the return of a somewhat different
Assembly from the one now existing, and prob-
ably one that will have much less sympathy with
the Council and be much more anxious to fight
that effete institution with an axe on sight. An
Assembly which was really yearning to fight the
48 Rich Landlords to a finish is a great and
beautiful possibility.
Hourigan,
M.L.A. (S.A.),
in a recent speech
in the House, sug-
gested that the
publi c debt
should be repu-
diated on the
ground that it
was not contract-
ed with the con-
sent of, or for the
benefit of, the pre-
sent generation
Nothing is said in
Hourigan’s phil-
osophy about
handing to the
public creditor,
when the debt is
repudiated, the
roads, railways,
bridges, tele-
graph s, tele-
E hones, light-
ouses, &c., that
were built with
his money. Con-
sidering how well
the present gene-
ration is doing at
borrowing money
without the con-
sent of its sons it
shouldn’t put on
too much high
moral frill about
the way its fath-
ers borrowed
without its con-
sent.
If the cable reports are to be relied upon,
the Maoriland Old-Age Pension scheme seems to
have gone under for the present, and the Seddon
Govt, has been considerably defeated by its own
party. It wasn’t in any sense a Tory victory.
The Democratic party wanted to extend the
pension system even further than the Government
pro posed, and the Govt, approved of the idea in
the abstract, but asked its supporters to go slow in
view of the money-liability involved. The House
carried its point, however, whereupon the Ministry
seems to have told it to run the business itself and
gone out to gnash its teeth in the lobby. This
lamentable ruction has probably wrecked, for the
present session, about the greatest and best idea
on the Govt, programme.
In a leader, in its issue of September 19,
Sydney Telegraph broke even its fine record as a
garbler of statistics. It sets forth that, from June
>94, to June, ’95, N.S.W. gained 31,710 of popula’
tionj, and from the latter date to June, ’96, the
population increased by 21,620 ; total increase for
two years, 53,330. This is the biggest increase for
the two years among the Australasian provinces,
and the Telegraph remarks joyfully that “the
period, it will be observed, is that in which the
Freetrade policy has been established in this pro-
vince.” The Freetrade policy, as everybody
knows, only began to be established in the latter
part of ’95. The first year quoted was a year of
Protection, and then the population increased
10,000 more than in the second, or Freetrade year.
IN THE SAME BOAT.
SPINSTER (to unemployed, who wonts “somethin’ to cat”) : But you
don’t look too old to get work.”
UNEMPLOYED : “ An’ you don’t look too old to get married—hut ’taint
what WE thinks as matters.”
In fact, the shoddy organ annexes the splendid
population results shown under Protection, and
credits them to the opposite policy, and then
whoops.
Caldwell, of S.A. Assembly, wants a tax on
bicycles. The bike-tax is a valuable source of
revenue in France, and it seems a promising sub-
ject to put a duty on. One of The Bulletin’s
favorite financial theories is that the proceeds of
certain taxes should be set apart for the construc-
tion of railways and other public works, so that
/they won’t be dependent either on borrowed
money or on the uncertain and unreliable surplus,
and with this end in view it proposes some day to
write an article on “Neglected Sources of
Revenue.” A few items are: an annual tax on
bicycles, racehorses, jockeys, bookmakers, pianos,
patent medicines, carriages, buildings over a cer-
tain height, percentage on the “ tote,” ditto on
Tattersall’s sweeps (which could be legalised on
Tatt. paying over a reasonable share of the profits
as the price of his monopoly), unclaimed deposits
and dividends, tax on lawyers, foreign bagmen,
foreign fire insurance companies, foreign proprie-
tary life ditto, foreign banks, and on absentees,
proceeds of State salt monopoly, &c., &c.


The very mist which rises in the morning
from Parsons’ famous Flaked Oatmeal is superior
to that of the ordinary brands of breakfast stuff,
and it is doubtless in part the public appreciation
of this fine food which has moved the firm to
occupy large new premises at 321-7 Kent-st.,
Sydney, with six floors available for the rnanu.
facture of Parsons’ specialties. Here are the jam-
boiling room, with a capacity of 10 tons per day ;
the tin-making shop ; the fruit-cooling chamber;
the apparatus and space for making sauce and
pickles and cordial and cocoa, and all the other
necessaries and luxuries which the great mouth of
the public yearns for—when made by Parsons.

H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Llizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*

In N.S.W., where a special effort is being
made to put down the legitimate pub.—which
pays a license fee, and has to sell decent liquor,
and must keep order, and close at certain fixed
hours, and preserve some semblance of cleanliness
you may still raise Cain and snakes at all hours
of the day or night, and seven days a week, or
eight if you can find them, simpiy by calling
yourself a “club.’ A club pays no license; it
hasn’t to provide eating or sleeping accommoda-
tion ; it may sell any ki rid of liquor it pleases at
any hour it pleases ; it may burst the Day of Rest
into as many pieces as it likes; it isn’t police-
inspected—the members may habitually sit around
with nothing on if they want to ; in fact, there are
very few things that a club may not do. And yet
the public ignorance is so great that something
like a fourth of the male community spends its
Sundays trying to get in at the back door of the
hotel to buy some sweet-oil for a horse.
The humorlessness of dogma. The Search
Light, Melb.’s new church organ, describes itself
on its own posters as “ the most suggestive paper
in Australia.”
Pew : “ Why is the preaching of the Gos-
pel of Christ not worthy to engross a man’s life,
even as law, physics, journalism, or politics ?
Pastor Pitchett must surely give the cream of his
work to editing the Review oe Reviews ; also
Southern Cross, and compiling the ‘ Deeds that
Won the Empire,’besides being president of the
Wesleyan Ladies’ College. Yet he is in the job of
converting the world and saving souls. Is this
only worthy the fag-end of a man’s mind ? Can
he just throw in a little bit of Jesus Christ as a
side-show ? To be sure, a politician thinks he can
govern a nation with the remains of a mind im-
mersed in his own twopenny-halfpenny business.
Even he can be excused, rather than a divine.”

with no artist is the profession so much wrapped up in
the whole life as with the musician. Music is to its aver-
age devotee something more than a religion—almost a
fanaticism. Witness the deathbed wish of Madam Fanny
Simon sen, when her one desire was that a copy of the
Faust score might be buried with her. Such an expression
would appear ludicrous in a painter or a writer.
Theorbo : “ Fannie Simonsen was a bitterly-disappointed
woman, her only bright spot the triumph of her charming
daughter, Frances Saville. When Madame Simonsen
came to Australia she was an artless, simple creature, and
slowly developed into the business-woman. One thing
that stuck to her through life was a contempt for dress
and extravagance. She ought to have died wealthy, but
dogged ill-luck pursued her. At first she was only the
Madame Musin, to the fiddling of her husband, but Lyster
diagnosed her powers. He played her off against Lucy
Escott. What a furore over the rival casts of ‘ L’Afri-
caine,’ when Simonsen and Beaumont palpably beat
Escott and Squires ! Beaumont had then immense public
sympathy, through having only just lost his eye, in the
shooting-accident, at the hands of Lyster’s brother, not
Fred. It was quite immense for Fanny to create the
Grand Duchess as she did, without Beaumont and Farley,
the unapproachable Bourn. Madame’s business powers
were evinced when she ransacked Milan, Rome, Venice,
Naples, Florence, Turin, for singers, and fetched her A 1
Italian Opera Co But the game was dead. Even Wil-
liamson and Musgrove’s fine quintette, with such blazing
novelties as Pagliacci and Cavalleria Rusticana, did not
answer too well. The worst frost of the Simonsens was
over the ghastly Spanish Students, for whom, however,
Madame was in no way responsible. The drudgery of
teaching was hateful to her. After retiring from the
boards she flashed for a night as Valentine, in “The
Huguenots,” through Madame Ciuti’s illness. Madame
Simonsen had never acted it before, took it at a moment’s
notice, and quite triumphed.”
The tale goes that George Musgrove attended the
Lohmann benefit performance of “ Othello,” at Covent
Garden Theatre, expecting to find amateurs only on the
job. lago struck him as being a phenomenally fine
amateur until he looked at his programme and discovered
that veteran Hermann Vezin was playing the part of the
ancient. Mussy, strange to say, had never before seen
Vezin.
Miss Mabelle Davidson, the amateur Girofle-Girofla at
Melb. Bijou, is a Bendigo girl who made her debut as a
principal in the Lyric Club performance of “ Marjorie ”
two or three years ago. Miss Mabelle on that occasion
played Cicely in smart, taking style, with rather more
assurance than the average pro., and her success under
the circumstances was remarkable. The damsel is anxious
to take to the stage, and the Firm will possibly cast its
eye in her direction.
Many people who knew Frank Cates merely as a some-
what rigid juvenile in comedy are quite unaware that he
was a splendid mimic—in fact, a better mimic than
juvenile.
Haresfoot: “ Cates was plunged in the financial bog
these 15 years. Couldn't walk the Block without ‘ Er—
Mr. Katz—jutht one word.’ ”
Amusing to notice that Melb. Age duly reported the
Saturday evening performance of “Trip to Chinatown,”
at which a flashlight photo, of the auditorium was taken
from the stage, without a word of reference to this special
incident. If the photo, had been taken for the wearisome
Leader instead of the Australasian, then would David
Syme’s daily organ have printed half-a-column concern-
ing the little mutual admiration trick.
Next time that a first-class performance of a clever and
expensively-produced comedy (sans music-hall songs) is
happening at Melb. Princess’s, why not take a flashlight
photo, of the half-empty benches, and hang it beside the
painful proof of public soft-headedness recorded in the
“ Chinatown ” picture ?
The latest fable re cycling among members of the per-
fesh alleges that an enthusiastic tragedian, who had
travelled to the theatre on his bike, cried, “ Ye gods I
am punctured ! ” when the villain stabbed him in the
back.
Tooth: “ What an absurdity for Maxine Elliot to be
acting a woman from whom a man runs away ! ”
London Bridge is the climax of Hertz’s cinematograph
The audience is most tickled by the flick of the drayman’s
whip, and the young fellow who looks round, whereon
the gallery, immersed in the illusion, yells an irrepressible
“Hi!”
Rignold has not been suggested as a possible candidate
for Svengarlic honors—nathless his Paolo Macari has
many points in common with the unwashed Hebrew.
The foreign accent, the mysterious influences exerted
over the crazy Pauline, and his tragic end.
Melb. managers begin to find that they need no hired
claque when Chief Sec. Peacock visits the theatre. The
other evening, at the Princess’, the politician broke out
into such fiendish cachinnation at Conor’s reference to
Duffy and high-kicking telephone girls, that hysterics
seemed imminent. Manager Mitchell afterwards offered
him a box for the first night of his new burlesque, with
the idea, probably, of ensuring a successful start. The
next thing will be (in big type) “The laughing Peacock,
to-night, by special arrangement.”
Geo. Coppin’s visit to Adelaide recalls the fact that he
built the first Adelaide theatre in 1848, and himself took a
hand with the spade in digging foundations, afterwards
acting with G. V. Brooke. Subsequently Coppin made a
fortune out of the Exchange Hotel, Adelaide (still stand-
ing, by the way), but dropped it in mining.
Veteran George Coppin, visiting Adelaide with the
Maggie Moore Co., struck an old friend in Ebenezer Ward,
M.L.C. Ward was with Coppin (when the latter starred
with G. V. Brooke) about 40 years ago, and left him to
embrace journalism and politics in Adelaide. “ Ebby ”is
now one of the leading windbags of the Stomach-Party,
and is a greater actor in politics than ever he was on the
stage.
The puzzled patron of “ A Trip to Chinatown” is the
Chinaman.
A new ad. is perforce a stroke of genius. Harry Conor
notifies, by shop-window placards, that he buys his (what-
ever it is) there. As many hands for gloves as Briareus.
It has not taken Ada Crossley long to work herself into
the first flight of oratorio singers in England. She is to
appear with Ella Russell, Edward Lloyd, and Santley in
the “Elijah,” selected for interpretation by Liverpool
Philharmonic Society.
“ Tommy ” (T. Mandeno) Jackson, well to the front as a
singer in London, is a Maorilander, and a son of old Sam
Jackson, who for many years had a snug legal business in
Auckland. Tom had arrived at man’s estate before it was
recognised that he had a voice worth cultivating—indeed,
he had begun business as an auctioneer, and it is said
that the mellifluosity of his “ going—going—gone ! ”
struck the delicate ear of Henry Brett, and led to the
giving of advice which altered the young man’s career.
Jackson is a good-looking splendidly-built fellow.
Engineering-Demonstrator Mann, of Melb. Univ., is
being inundated with orders for cinematographe motors
and hew plates from pros, who intend touring with them
through Australasia.
• P ° r ™ tB °* tenor Tapley sent from London to friends
in Melbourne do credit to a Melb. wig-maker. Tapley,
. ° 1 ? 1 on *°P> had on a close-fitting- scalp-wig made
in Melbourne, and now he wears it always. It produces a
sweet delusion of juvenility in Joseph. Bv the way, the
female relatives of the late Vi. Varley were feverishly
anxious lest Joseph, while he was out here, should marry
a daughter of Judah who has taken to the boards. How-
evei he didn t or she wouldn’t, one or the other.
Shipped by the Light of the Moon,” originally played
by the Girards in America, seems to be quite new to
Hingland, although G. R. Sims wrote it. Geo. Walton is
taking “ Skipped ” on a provincial tour, and Sims’ own
particular organ, the Referee, rises to explain that “this
play is described as an electric farce, with music.” How
little they know of Australian theatrical doings in the
little island ! Not long ago the Referee spoke of Nellie
Stewart as “ a young actress with considerable knowledge
of stage business.”
The exalted George Edwardes came to considerable
grief, the other day, through falling off his bike.
Our old amazonian acquaintance, Alice Barnett, figured
in the trial cast of “The Telephone Girl,” at a London
suburban theatre, the other day.
Would not a Captive Balloon be a payable novelty in
Melbourne and Sydney ?
The father of millionaire Winans, now the deer-forester
and crofter-expeller of Scotland, was a Philadelphia iron-
master, and made his pile constructing the St. Peters-
burg-Moscow railway for Czar Nicholas, who settled the
engineering disputes by drawing a straight line on the
map and giving Winans a free fist. The existing Winans
is the princely benefactor of the Alhambra ladies, under
the rule of Melbourner Moul. His father, conspicuous in
a red shirt, superintended the disembarkation of the
railway material at St. Petersburg-.
Libbey, of “ Chinatown,” has a music-publishing busi-
new in New York, and carries a letter (he will show it to
you on the slightest provocation) from the composer of
“ After the Ball,” in which he is mentioned as the man to
whom all credit is due for its success—a testimonial that
fits the ponderous humorist all over.
Dumas, to Bernhardt : “ People with curly hair like
you and me, Sarah, should never bind ourselves to any-
thing for life ! ”
The Vaidis Sisters, Rickards’ new import, came out to
Australia as children in the ship which originally brought
J. C. Williamson and his wife.

the objects of our ambition, except at times and
under circumstances which render them of no
avail.” This must have been the bitter feeling of
the residents of Pentridge Gaol, who were all in
bed and asleep at the time that the walls collapsed,
and left an opening 300 yards wide, with nobody
to take advantage of the occasion.
A Judge in the witness-box is like a doctor
ill, when he has to call in another. Turveydrop
J udge Redmond Barry appeared once in the box
at Melb. Supreme Court, and was ridiculously
nervous, totally failing in the speak-up he en-
joined on others. Same with beak Call, in similar
circumstances, whereat Bobbydom rejoiced, be-
cause he was peculiarly offensive in his speak-up.
Melbourne ’Erald had a really great burst
of unconscious humor, the other day, touching the
slaughter of Armenians. It commenced with—
“ The Turk. Shall we endure him ? ” and ended
as follows : —“ If Australia is to voice her indigna-
tion there must be a beginning somewhere. Shall
it not be in the Queen City of the South ? Let
Mayor Strong consider and answer ! ” The voice
of the writer, as he called upon poor old Strong to
“ consider and answer ! ” must have struck terror
to his own soul.
The case of a woman, charged at Fitzroy
(Melb.) with stealing goods from Eoyand Gibson’s
store, doesn’t seem calculated to soften the quality
of mercy in storekeepers. Early one Saturday
evening this female was caught stealing a pair of
boots. She pleaded hard for leniency, also she
was “respectably dressed,” so a member of the
-firm had pity and let her go. Later on, she ex-
pressed her gratitude by stealing some more boots
—three pairs this time. Given into custody, the
hardened offender got off with 14 days.
Ed. Bulletin, —Theology in the back-
blocks. When the Salvation Army came out to
Bowen Downs this shearing the Captain was
advised to go to the nap.-school to “ try her luck
for a few bob. ” She asked one man for money as
he looked at his cards, and he said, “Dwell
the peter ! I’ve got a nibble for two and if I get
’em I’ll give you a boxer.” Another member of
the “school” informed her that she was “a
Jonah.” She seemed rather flabbergasted at these
sayings, but they couldn’t choke her off. A wool-
shed is a great place for subscriptions. The
general opinion is that good wages are earned at
shearing, but the long waits for sheds and ex-
penses for travelling are never considered.—Shell-
back.
Some bones with a history attached were
dropped across the other day at Nowra (N.S.W.).
Nowra, in 1866, was a thinly-peopled spot on the
outer rim of nowhere in particular, and the person
who stepped out of it into the adjacent hills stood
a fair chance of being lost. A girl named Emily
Bourne stepped out and was lost so utterly that
no trace of her could be discovered. Then after
30 years, civilization overtook her bones, or some
bones that were believed to be hers, and the other
day the people who ought to have been her descen-
dants gave her decent burial. Possibly in another
three or four or five centuries civilization in Aus-
tralia will have overtaken the last of the accumu-
lated arrears of bones that lie ahead of it, and this
will cease to be the Great Disappearance Land.
Meanwhile, however, pursuit is slow and the
bones keep well ahead.
Opposition-leader Lyne and Premier Reid,
bobbing heads at one another across the social
table, and assuring a miscellaneous audience that
although they differ in politics they regard each
otherpersonallyas high-intentioned, noble-hearted,
white-conscienced patriots, provoke the vulgar to
exclaim, “What amiable humbugs!” Do poli-
ticians take note of the atmosphere in which they
live ? They are met like rivals in business-like
rivals in law or in divinity. They are—the Aus-
tralian brand, anyway—almost without exception,
traducers and defamers of one another’s intentions.
Opinions may differ about acts, and do so rightly;
but the air of Parliament is thick with the slander
of motives and the imputation of conscious crime.
When, then, leaders of these blatant jousts oleo-
margarine one another out of doors, the oily stuff
smells like condemned butcher’s beef on its way to
burial in Moore Park.
SPORTING NOTIONS .
“Monico” to The Bulletin from London :
“The rubber match was won on the first day when, in an
hour and a half’s play, the Englishmen knocked up 69 for
Grace’s wicket. The batsmen had an easy pitch, the
bowlers a slippery turf and a greasy ball, so what might
be expected happened. On the second day 24 wickets fell
for an average of 16J runs, and on the last 15 for 4i runs
apiece. England 84, Australia 44, fairly represent the
strength of the two teams on a sticky wicket when the
visitors are trying to play correct cricket—as they did on
this occasion. You might as well play for the ‘ spot-
stroke ’ at French billiards.
“ There was but one way to get runs on such a
wicket. The ball must be met, as it pitched, sharp and
hard with the full force of the bat, before it had time to
break and shoot off. Those who tried this —Trott,
M’Kibbin, and Trumble—showed a semblance of scoring.
A couple of bats of the Graham or Stoddart type might
have knocked up the required total in an hour or so. But
the Victorian is out of form, and the ‘weekly average
list ’ has killed whatever dash any of the others had.
“ Griffon was the failure of the match. His two
wickets cost 64 runs in an innings of 145. At his first try
he was in half-an-hour for a ‘duck’—and Clem Hill’s
wicket. He dropped Peel from a ‘ spoony ’ catch, fielded
otherwise sciatically, and in the second innings left the
wickets as soon as he could, decently or indecently, get
out. The best thing he did was to catch Abel one-
handed, and this he discounted by a playful pretence to
immediately throw down the other batsman’s wicket. It
was just such an emanation of misplaced waggishness on
his part that cost Hill’s wicket and killed all hope of a
fairly even first innings score.
“ The Oval on the second day might have been
likened to an immense signet-ring, of which the thou-
sands of ground spectators formed the circlet and the
shabby old pavilion the much-worn oblong centre-stone
set between the thickness of the two shelter sheds. ‘ All
the Australians in London were there,’ and many men
known to Australia, i.e., ex-Gov. Jersey, George Anson,
and George Musgrove, Alf. Plumpton, in a straw hat
with colors and badge ; Melb. Exhibition Lavater, and
doctors, prize-fighters, miners, journalists, pensioners,
brokers. When, Jon the third day, five English wickets
fell for 24, leaving 111 between Trott’s team and victory,
those who had witnessed in anguish the 18 and 53 feebly-
earned totals at Lords’ knew the case to be hopeless.
Grace opened with Richardson to Iredale, but on a dead
wicket Tom’s deliveries lacked ‘ whip,’ and were phiyed
with such confidence as to almost rouse hope in some
breasts. Wily W.G. saw the fast bowling was useless, off
went the Surrey ‘pro.,’ on went Peel, and down went
Australia’s hopes and wickets : I—o,1 —0, 2 —3, 3 —7, 4 —7
6—ll, 6—ll, 7—14, B—l 9, 9—35, 10—44 !
“ Immediately Abel ended the match by catch-
ing M‘Kibbin, short slip, the yelling crowd burst across
the ground from either side converging on the pavilion-
gate where the police had a tough job to keep a lane for
the players to enter through. And there the thousands
stood for an hour cheering England, Australia, individual
players, but omitting to do justice to the real winner of
the rubber-match for Grace and Co.—i.e., Jupiter Pluvius.
“After an important match the crowd swarm
the ground and call for the more popular men until they
appear, acknowledge the salutations, and retire. They
patter for Abel thus : ‘ Bob—Bob—Bob—Bob-Bob,’ to at
least the amount of a ‘ tenner ’ in five minutes. The first
Australian called for was ‘ Trum-bull, Trum-bull,* and
he with ‘Trott — Trott — Trott,’ ad lib., was received with
great cheering. The position of control has made Trott,
and he has made a good captain. His handling of his
bowling and placing of his field in this match were widely
and highly spoken of. Popular with the cricket crowds,
he does his best to encourage his bats to get the value of
their wickets, and he himself got out to a brilliant catch
of Brockwell’s when trying to force and save the game.
“A rope only divides the playing-grounds in
England from the surrounding spectators, who, at the
interval, saunter on to the turf and indulge in an al
fresco lunch. On August bank-holidav the results of this
picnicking strewed the Oval with bottles and lunch-
wrappers, and delayed the resumption of the Surrey-
Yorkshire match.
“Kelly, as a wicket-keeper, is a 50 per cent,
improved man, and Johns, who gets little chance, cannot
hope to excel him. Witness the N.S.W. man’s one bye
(a leg, too) in a score of 145 as against Lilley’s 9 sundries
in 119. As a bat at a pinch he is dogged, though clumsy,
and behind the ‘ sticks ’ as keen as a fox-terrier with the
pluck of a Blackham, to whom many English cricketers
now. conipare. him —but they forget. His stumping of
Ranjitsinghi in the match just over was worthy of the
prince of wicket-keepers himself.
“The‘pros.’ having proved they cannot be
done without, and drawn public attention to the well-
paid ‘amateur-pro.,’ iqeekly said they ‘ were sorry and
would never be naughty again,’ and received forgiveness.
Lohmann’s apology came later, but was more humbly
penitent. Gunn has not yet ‘ eaten the leek,’ and is not
likely to.”
* » * *
“ The third test-match, ” writes an Australian
abroad to Tiie Bulletin, “proved the inability of the
ninth Australian Eleven to play on a bad wicket. The
stand made by Darling and Iredale in their first innings
was as unexpected as brilliant. How that pair ever made
up their minds to try and get runs and chance their
wickets will always be a source of mystery. They had
never done such a thing before, and in their second ven-
ture never attempted it.
“ Trumble’s bowling throughout the third test-
match was greatly admired by experts. He kept a
splendid length throughout, and, with the sticky wicket
to help him, made the ball do marvels. Though his
average, 12 wickets for 89, is not quite as good as either
Hearne’s or Peel’s, it must be remembered that the Vic.
‘ six-foot length ’ had to take his turn on the soft, easy
wicket of the Monday evening, and that throughout he
was bowling against men who had far more experience of
sticky wickets than the Australians had.
“ During the Canterbury cricket-week, of which
the Australian match occupied the last three days, a
historically ancient custom is kept up by giving on two
evenings theatrical performances. These are done by
well-known local amateurs, who belong to a society called
from time immemorial, “ The Old Stagers,” though, as
just now they are all very young men, and as Irene Van-
brugh (who was in Australia with Toole) was leading lady,
the title has lost its significance. On the second night, a
specially-written epilogue was gone through—poorly
written and of slight interest till suddenly came these
words, or something like them, given with tremendous
effect:
‘ But what is this that we to-night hail here ?
Why, ’tis the famous Team from far Australia.’
Then, round the O.P. corner, Trott’s head shyly appeared,
and it was evident that there was some difficulty in getting
him to take his cue. Simultaneously, however, he and
Harry Musgrove, looking very unhappy, were shot on, and
two or three more struggled after them. It was a sight
for the gods, but the appearances on the stage of this very
worthy team should be reserved for their friends only.
They are too much for public enthusiasm to stand.
“Iredale ran himself out in the most foolish
manner after his excellent first innings in the test-match
at the Oval. He and Darling had run four for a bye, and,
with a silly desire to make the fifth he started on a
hopeless attempt. Giffen in the same innings ran out
young Clem. Hill by calling a second run that was not
probable, though perhaps just possible. This team has
on more than one occasion destroyed big chances by
faulty running between wickets.
“Clem Hill is called ‘Kruger,’ because of an
alleged likeness. Manager Musgrove is boiled right down
to'Ger’—soft'g.’
“ In considering the conduct of the professionals
in re the third test-match, it must be remembered that
as far back as June after the first of the series they asked
for the extra £lO, but were refused. That at Manchester
they asked for it before the match, and were told that the
matter would be considered, but had since heard nothing.
The Surrey executive knew all about these applica-
tions, for they had carpeted Richardson over the matter,
and told him that he ought to be proud to play ‘ for the
honor of it,’ and Richardson had replied that he had
discovered honor would not keep his wife and children,
and the applications for an increase were sent in as
soon as the invitations to play were received.”
• * * *
“An Australian Traveller” writes from Lon-
don:—“Dear Bulletin, —Do not speak crossly to the
Eleven because of the third test-match. They were really
not so much to blame. Says London Sun, 12th Aug.: —
‘ The Australians took their gruel like men. As a team
they are a great team, but on a bad wicket could never
hope to beat the chosen of this country. They fought
with stubbornness and determination to the very end,
and the memory of their game struggle will linger with
us for years. In fielding and bowling they were our
equals ; in batting, on such a wicket, our inferiors.'
“I saw it all, and the game was won on the
toss. Grace and Jackson put on 69 runs the first day on
a slow, but easy, wicket. And those 69 were the 66 by
which England won. ‘No man,’ said Murdoch, whose
soul was sad, to me, ‘ no man will make runs against J. T.
Hearne and Peel on that wicket. And no team in the
world would make 100.’
“ I never saw men so disappointed. Jones was
the only man who took his turn with a smile. “ I’ll be
bowled,” he said when he went to face the music, “ but
I’m past participled if I’m bowled blocking.” Hearne
and Peel bowled a fair record, but nothing can ever lessen
the memory of Trumble’s display with the ball, and
M'Kibbin’s with both bat and ball.
“ After the wicket began to dry—that is, when
play was resumed on Tuesday morning—England made in
all 160 runs for 19 wickets, and Australia 163 for 20.
Wherefore, I say, the 69 runs got when the wicket was
easy won the match. Grace’s smile could be heard for
hours afterwards. You’ll be glad to notice that the
worms—professional worms —have turned. Certainly
they are trying to wriggle back, but they’ve had their
portraits taken meanwhile, and their position will pro-
bably be fully discussed now.
‘ ‘ Australians are abused for taking their share
of the gate—so per cent, of the ground-money and none
of the stand. Do tell me, am I right in saying that Eng-
lish teams in Australia get 75 per cent, and a shave of the
stand ? ”
# * * *
No bowler ever did better than did Turner in
22 Bathurst v. English Eleven, 1881. Going on when
three English wickets had fallen in the first innings, he
bagged the remaining 7, and in the Britishers’ second
innings took all 10 ; 17 consecutive wickets.
* * * *
In the three test-matches C. Hill totalled only
30 runs ; 5 runs per innings.
* * * *
Blackham’s testimonial deserves a response all
over Australasia. David Syme starts off liberally, as a
souvenir of Blackham senior, so long Age overseer.
Cricket is a poor game, as crutch instead of staff, without
a Govt, billet, like Giffen or “ Felix” Horan.
* » * *
The Australian Cricket Annual is to far too
great an extent a compilation of stale news and common-
place remarks. For although good cricketers contribute
articles, these articles only show that a good cricketer can
be an execrable writer. Mr. Garrett, in his weak intro-
duction, hashes up facts which are trite to every school-
boy. The article on “The Australian Season” is a
boarding-school girl’s scream : “ Sadness that sends every
muscle in one’s body quivering and eyes welling with
tears in the hour of some great defeat.” “ Eyes welling
w'ith tears ” ! Is the Australian cricketer a pious little
miss who has been forcefully kissed by a bold, bad man ?
He is typically a thick-hided, lumpy-headed individual,
who, when he gets a big licking, damns his own bad and
the other side’s good luck, curses the eyes and tongues of
the blanky umpires, drinks several hard drinks, ana vows
to get level in the return-match. Another perfervid
shriek (about bygone matches) : “ What abiding ravishing
reminiscences are entwined.” This man evidently
rooms ” with a cricket-bat. More goosey-gander :
“ Rueful, tearful eyes to see the sunshine shadowed by a
sudden rise of thick clouds upon the horizon.” It is an
old maid talking to her curate.

W. It. Wilson’s lot for the Yic. Spring meetings
grows less dangerous in appearance. Nada’s mishaps
have discounted her Flemington prospects, and Strath-
spey and Bedford were last week scratched for the two
Cups. Strathspey was rather a favorite whisper among
,men-in-the-street.
* • * *
The defunct Malua was an odd-made horse in-
asmuch as his hind-quarters didn’t seem natural to the
rest of him. The same peculiarity has been noticeable in
some of his get—Malolo, for instance.
Although Malua won a Melbourne and an Aus-
tralian Cup (2J mile) he never proved himself a stayer of
the Carbine stamp. Carbine, as everybody knows,
carried his 10stj 51b. lengths in front of the Melb. Cup
field for the last three furlongs or so. Malua couldn’t
have done that, but, all the same, Inglis’s champion was a
great horse with a wonderful rush which always “ came
off” at the right moment when business was meant. No
other animal in Australian racing history achieved such a
wide range of successes in big handicaps—a Newmarket,
an Adelaide Cup, Melbourne Cup, and Australian Cup.
Then, being put to the “sticks,” he won the V.R.C.
Grand Nat. Hurdle Race, after which the veteran showed
a flash of his old brilliancy by taking the Geelong Cup
with 9st. 41b. up. It used to be said that Malua’s rush
spoilt his jockey, Alec. Robertson, for riding other horses
by tempting him to wait too long with them. Trenton’s
defeat for Melb. Cup which Sheet Anchor won was a case
•in point. The stout Maorilander had a mere trifle of
•7st. 121 b. in the saddle, yet poor Robertson kept the
“dead bird” back until the winning-post was near instead
of giving him a chance to win on his stamina. 'Trenton,
Hit and well, finished only third to Sheet Anchor and
Grace Darling, through being ridden on the Malua system.
Next year, with a dotty leg and a lot of superfluous fat
•on him, he carried another couple of stone into second
place behind Arsenal.

The A.J.C. committee acted most severely in
the Le Var case. To all racing-men it was patent that
Coil could have left Le Yar when he liked: M’Namara
knew this and so did not ride his mount out to the bitter
•end. To censure Messrs. Clark and Payten and suspend
the jockey was Draconian indeed.
* * * *
Though Destiny cut up badly in the Metrop,
this Cup chance must not be altogether despised, as he can
lbe much improved during the next six weeks. Same
stable sent Mostyn to Sydney last year as a certainty for
(Epsom, in which it ran poorly, yet what sort of perform-
ances did it put up at V.A.T.C. and V.R.C. Spring
meetings ?

L. : “According to existing rules of racing an
'owner can do what he likes with his own as regard scratch-
ing until within half-an-hour of time set for race. Why,
ithen, Mr. Hordern’s profuse explanations re the scratching
•of The Skipper for Hawkesbury Handicap ? In the interests
•of the public, who, after all, keep the game going, the
'scratching rule needs revision ; horses not struck out of a
race the day before date of running should go to the post
■unless a very valid excuse for their absence be furnished
to the stewards.”

Mr. Hordern’s reported explanation as to the
scratching of The Skipper, like most explanations, had
been better left unsaid. No aspersions were east on his
trainer—the public blamed Mr. Hordern, and him alone.
Mr. Hordern acknowledges that he had made up his
mind on Friday to scratch the horse, and no excuses as
to business engagements can alter the fact that he
allowed the public to go on backing The Skipper until
the last moment on Saturday. If Mr. Hordern was too
busy to go to Earnshaw on Friday, a sixpenny wire or
one of his army of employes could have brought Earn-
shaw to him.

The Steeplechase at Rand wick on Saturday was
even a greater farce than the Derby. Half-a-mile from
the start Confusion was actually pulled into a trot, and
Chris, the hard puller, was reeling and smashing his
fences for want of a leader to show him over. Reckless
was the only horse who did not fall, and finished a furlong
ahead of old Bushman, who was remounted smartly by
Hendricks after falling over the last fence. Five falls and
two horses killed is a record for even the Randwick
Steeplechase course.

The past A.J.O. meeting can be summed up
briefly: “ Bookies boomed, backers broke.” In-and-out
running, sometimes intentional, at others the pure cussed-
ness of the noble race’orse, utterly befogged backers, and
the only redeeming feature of the meeting was the brilliant
and consistent form displayed by Newhaven, whose vic-
tories have rightly enough placed him in position of first
favorite for Melb. Derby and Cup. In the Derby the
only animal which seems likely to trouble him is Resolute,
but to carry 7st. 131 b. to victory in the Cup will test his
marvellous powers to the uttermost.
Randwick Plate, with which are associated such
names as Le Grand, Nordenfeldt, Trident, Abercorn, and
Melos, was won by the runty Tir6 in smin. 52sec., thus
exceeding time-limit by 7sec., and so securing only half
stakes. Pity that a time-limit is not fixed for all races a
mile and a half and over, thus preventing long-distance
races revolving themselves into sprints, as was the case in
Derby and Waverley Handicap.
Lochiel came out on top in the list of winning
sires with three winners to his credit, whilst Carbine,
Newminster, Robert the Devil, and Splendor dead-heated
with two apiece.
Throughout Randwick meeting the horseman-
ship displayed by the majority of the jockeys was exe-
crable. Little Fielder cleverly handled Steward and Loch
Leigh, whilst James Gough showed some of his old bril-
liance in squeezing Royal Rose home for Squatter’s Han-
dicap.
Whatever the cause—handicapper, plethora of
racing, or bad luck —owners seem to fight shy of Rand-
wick. For the A. J.C. Sept, meeting to be held there to-
day (Saturday) but 67 entries have been received for five
races. Head-quarters of turf in N.S.W. Evidently a
screw loose somewhere. Messrs. Long and Hordern have
nominated freely, and perhaps a few races will fall to
their representatives.

S.A. football season ended Sept. 12. South
Adelaide club secured top place with 16 wins and two
drawn games, Norwood second. The undefeated Souths
were so strong that Adelaide football-matches last season
degenerated into a farce. The once-famous Port
Adelaide team comes absolutely last on the list. Next
year the S.A.F.A. intends to experiment with district
clubs, a final desperate attempt to fight the rival game of
lacrosse, which has increased in popularity by leaps and
bounds.

It only needs a few trots like last Monday’s
handicap at Brighton to give the sport a big fillip about
Sydney. The long-looked-for match between Huon Junior
and Hattie S for £2OO a-side proved a fiasco, Huon cutting
out his mile in 2.24 J, and distancing the mare in the first
heat. The handicap proved one of the best exhibitions
of trotting yet seen about Sydney. Creole led till turning
into the straight for the last time, when Regina passed
him, but Huon Junior, getting out of the block, came
like a flash and beat Regina on the post by a head. Both
horse and mare finished under the whip like a couple of
'bus horses, amidst excitement seldom seen in Australia
over a trotting race.

Saturday’s Melb. football-matches did not, after
all, settle the Premiership, Fitzroy’s defeat of Colling-
wood, South’s win against P. Melb., leaving Collingwood
and South equal at the top of the list. Collingwood’s
match was, perhaps, one of the most even and exciting
ever seen in Melb., even the hitherto uninterested public
going wild with enthusiasm. The first half and
third quarter finished with the scores even, and when,
towards the finish, Fitzroy led by a goal, Collingwood’s
play was desperate and excellent. They failed, however,
in goal-kicking, and the game ended—Fitzroy, 4g. 4b.;
Collingwood, 3g. Bb. To-day (26th) South and Colling-
wood play off for the premiership. The result is a toss-
up, but South should win.
How about a draw in the play-off ? What a
mighty temptation for another and a greater match with
correspondingly-increased interest and “ gate 1 ”

C. H. Herbert, of Ballarat, carried off the Vic.
10-mile harrier championship in winning by a quarter of a
mile from Fryer, who was half that distance ahead of Tom
Blake, the Carlton footballer, the ’95 champion. Fryer
jumped into runner-up’s place from being 42nd last year.
This is Herbert’s second win, for in 1894 he finished first,
100yds. ahead of Flack, who won several events at the
recent Greek Olympian sports.

Wally Kerr, one of thfc smallest and most re-
markable of Australian cyclists, is coming on to the
racing-track again. Kerr gave up racing some time ago,
but the news of Gaudaur, aged 39, winning a champion
sculling-contest has persuaded him that a man is never
too old to race.

A ghastly cycling story comes from America.
Griebler started one of 13 in a half-mile race at Lima, Ohio.
Before half a lap had been run Kimble and Stevens came
down, Sarger ran broadside into Bald and then fell.
Griebler, in his superhuman effort to avoid the fallen
riders and machines, burst a blood vessel, became insen-
sible, dashed into the four-foot embankment enclosing
the track, pitched off headlong, and was picked up dying.
His left ear was torn off, his skull fractured, and blood
was flowing from his mouth and nose. No cricketer has
yet been killed upon Sydney Cricket Ground, despite
the innumerable matches played there, out the new
cement track will not. be down long before some cyclist
will peg out there.

John S. Johnson, one of the crack American
flyers, and the speedy Barden are half-promised for Aus-
tralia in Nov. and Dec. respectively. Johnson was very
discontented with English racing, the purses being “ so
small that you wanted a microscope to find them.” Stories
of Martin’s winnings will doubtless draw a few good men
here before long.
* * * *
The American Wheelman, after remarking that
Jack Parsons “talks with a decided British accent,”
gives its interview with Parsons verbatim : “ Parsons said
Johnson and I became very good chums over in England,
you know, and when they were putting up such bloody
small purses we decided to come to America and ride the
rest of the season, and then go to Australia, where the
season promises to be very brilliant. The statement made
by Walford, the manager of Zimmerman, to the effect
that he paid me £25 to allow the American to win is a
Weedin’ lie, you know, as I never received a cent, and
when Zimmerman won he won honestly. Zimmerman was
very popular in Australia, which is not the case with
Martin, who, as I understand it, recently tried to punch
one of the officials, you know.” Parsons could not talk
about Martin this way in Australia, because Martin is
universally recognised as the gamest and most honest
rider who has yet appeared upon our tracks. As for
punching people, Martin has done so, and very vigorously,
too; but he only took a manly stand when set upon by
some “ gun ”or bully. Martin’s reputation is built upon
walloping cyclists at cycling—he badly walloped Parsons,
tor instance.

The latest American yarn is that cyclist Ander-
son, paced by a locomotive and running on a boarded
track laid between the rails, did a mile in lmin. 3sec.
Anderson used a 92 gear.

Stanbury s sudden departure after his defeat
by Gaudaur indicates not in the slightest degree that he
was satisfied that he lost the race on his merits,” remarks
a Bulletin correspondent. “ The Hawkesburv man, long

tain date.

The all-conquering cycle, In order to gain the
subscnptions of racing cyclists for training on its track,
bt. lUlda (Vic.) C.C. has prepared a special pitch outside
the ground altogether, and ukased that all cricket
practice shall take place on this, so that the sprinting
wheelmen need have no fear of flying balls. The coolness
with which the cricketers are ordered off their own ground
to make way for the sport with the most cash in it is
sublime.

The day of the Bendigo-to-Melb. road-race,
pedestrians in the latter city were startled by meeting a
hatless youth, attired only in a sleeveless jersey, cycling
?“ oes 0 esa n d almost legless knickerbockers, sauntering'down
the Block with a huge 17 on his back. At first he was
thought to be Nudity Apostle Macdonald. The apparition,
followed by a host of yelling small bovs, threaded his
way through unfrequented rights-of-way and untrafficked
streets to where the race was to finish, and there awaited
the competitor to whom he had confided his bike on
dropping out at Kyneton and coming to Melb. by train.

The only sport that ex-clmmpion Bill Beach
now indulges in is pigeon-shooting. He is only a fair
shot, which signifies that he does not lose much money at
the game. It is the good pigeon-shot that loses—the
deceased Owen Friend, for instance, has lost as much as
±l4OO in one afternoon on Sydney ground backing him-
self on the first bird. And there are two other Svdneyites,
now of middle age and in poor case, who lost most of
their big inherited fortunes (one £BO,OOO and the other,
perhaps, £00,000) by backing gun against bird.
A quick shot is F. B. Bloomfield, who, on
Sydney ground last week, shared the Ladies’ Bracelets
with five others, and took the Boswell’s gun prize by
arrangement with W. A. McLennan. Bloomfield anil
M‘Lennan each shot 20 birds in succession before Coining
to terms. Bloomfield grassed his bird very often within
a foot or two of the trap, and much of his shooting was of
true exhibition order.
The Hordern Shield, valued at =BlOO, was won
by Mr. C. H. Kerry in fine style with a Greener gun,
Kerry’s was a popular win, because he already had one-
leg in, and thus the downing of his 21st bird made the
shield his. He received quite an ovation.
What A. W. Eales is thought of as a pigeon-
shot is evidenced by the fact that, although shooting from
31yds., and in comparatively poor form, none of the books
would take less than 2 to 1 on the first barrel.

“Useful Hints about Bicycles and Tyres ” has
recently been published by W. J. C. Elliott, who probably
knows quite as much about cycles and cyclists as anyone
else in Australia. The book, however, omits to give any
useful hintsabout mending the cyclist himself.
An Australian triplet did a mile in 1 min. 58J

mile when he rode 31 miles in one hour. What a feat for

There are very few things which the ordinary
policeman won’t swear to when he gets started. At Mel-
bourne, the other day, a weedy youth with a bone-shaker
was charged with furious riding, and the “cop” climbed
into the box and swore, with a serious countenance, that
he was doing 30 miles an hour. Yet even plugger Bil-
martin, when plugging the immortal soul out of himself
on a made track, only achieved something like 27 miles
an hour, and the policeman who stopped Bilmartin while
going at that pace wouldn’t be able to swear to anything
for at least a week afterwards.

to do any hard Work, had no appe-
tite, food distressed me, and I suf-
fered much from headache. My
skin was sallow and sleep did not
refresh me. I tried several reme-
dies and consulted a doctor, with-
out obtaining any relief; finally,
one of hiy Customers recommended
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. It helped me
from the first,—in fact, after taking
six bottles I was completely cured,
and could eat anything and sleep

From a Sydney Ministerial paper : ‘ ‘ Owing

city to meet the demands made upon their re-
sources on account of the ever-increasing applica-
tions for help,” &c. How we do keep on getting
“ jolly and fat ” !
A Sydney Domain worthy, fired with a
high ambition, obtained a free railway-ticket to
Forbes on the assurance that he was certain of a
job of work from an old friend when he got there.
Met a few nights later in his old haunt in the
Domain, he admitted that his return was quick,
but confidentially explained that all he wanted to
do at Forbes was to cut his name on the wooden
railing erected there round the grave of bushranger
Ben Hall.
At Westbury, a small N. Tas. township,
there is a fine, imposing, stone, slate-roofed school,
capable of seating some hundreds of children. It
is even a finer edifice than any township “hall.”
(If three houses in T. stand within a square-mile
they call themselves a “township,” and see about
having a “ hall ” —generally with a mortgage on
it.) visitors to W. ask how such a building came
to be erected. This is the answer : Some five or
six years back this building and a small one were
designed for State schools. This one was to be
situated at Launceston, the northern capital, the
other at Westbury. The designs got mixed—and
so the Launceston building got erected at West-
bury !
A recent Yic. garrotting case recalls an
incident of some years back. The victim, an old
man of nearly fourscore, was set upon by two
ruffians late at night, it being known to them that
he had £5 in his pocket. The old fellow had been
an athlete in his youth, and could still hit straight,
so that one of his assailants, coming incautiously,
received a jaw-shaker. It sealed the poor old
man’s fate, and after choking him the murderers
turned his pockets out without, however, finding
a single penny. The money had disappeared, and
the dismayed couple had (as it turned out) hanged
themselves for nothing. Next morning the body
was found, and at the post-mortem the doctor, on
opening with difficulty the old man’s clenched
hand, discovered in his fist a fiver ! The mur-
derer had been literally struck with the money
and never knew it.

Cheviot (M.L.), writes a Bulletin corre-
spondent, is a teetotal district, inasmuch as there
are no pubs, within 40 miles, and yet there is a
thirst that can only be quenched by barrels of
colonial beer. An enterprising ex-publican tried
to cope with the thirst aforesaid by retailing
chain-lightning whisky, per nip, in a dark passage
at the back of his temperance boarding-house, but
a grateful friend put him away, and a £5O fine
and 18 months for perjury was the result. But
still the thirst goes on. Various temperance
societies have tried to grapple with it, but m vain,
as, after a bout of tea-drinking, it resumes its
course with renewed vigor. Last Christmas was
a very dry one, as, owing to some delay in transit,
the holiday beer-supply was late in arriving. A
dismal gloom settled on the little township of
M‘Kenzie (named after Jock M‘K., Minister of
Lands), and instead of sounds of revelry on the
Christmas-eve, all that could be heard was a burly,
beer-eating waggoner wandering up and down the
main street enquiring, in pathetic tones, “ if any-
one had a drop in the cruet.” Next day the sup-
ply arrived, and all previous hardships were for-
gotten in a glorious burst, which lasted a week.
The thirst is still in full blast.

Australia’s Most-Prominent Explorers.
Grand Hotel, Spring-st., Melbourne,
March 7th, 1895.
To Herb Rassmussen,
Proprietor of the Alfaline Remedies. _
Dear Sir, —It gives me great pleasure to inform
you that I have derived great benefit from your
celebrated Alfaline Remedies during my explor-
ing expeditions throughout Australia, and I con-
sider them invaluable to all travellers in the bush.
—Yours very truly, B. BUTTON,
(Formerly a Councillor, Brighton, England).
Witness : A. F. Beker, Manager, Grand Hotel,
Spring-street, Melbourne.
Mr. Button writes later: —“The Pills I had
from you were of great benefit to me and others.
In one case, when three hunters and trappers
were travelling about the ranges near my place on
the Rose River, one was taken very ill ; his mates
intended taking him in a waggon to Wangaratta
(about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor. I
gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to
inform you that having to pass their camp next
day, I found him up and pegging-out his skins
and looking well. This speaks volumes for your
valuable Remedies.”
A Lady’s Wish Fulfilled
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform
you that your celebrated Alfaline Universal Pills
cured me, when all other remedies and doctors
failed, of a stubborn case of Debility of 18 years’
standing. My wish is fulfilled at last, and I don’t
know how to thank you enough. Dear Sir, I
shall recommend your Alfaline Remedies to all
sufferers I come across. You are quite at liberty
to publish or make what use you like of this testi-
monial, and anyone writing to me will have full
particulars. I am, yours respectfully, Mrs. E.

Skin and Blood Cured.

To Herr Rassmussen,
I am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline
Lock Cure Pills completely cured me of a very
bad disease. Previous to taking your Lock Pills,
I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better; and I shall
never regret trying your Alfaline Pills, as they
had a wonderful effect on my complaint, which
several of my work-mates can testify to. I have
recommended your Alfaline Herbal Remedies to
several of my friends, who have reason to be very
grateful for it, and I shall always do my best to
recommend them to any fellow sufferers. You
are authorised to publish this testimonial.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint a's
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours verv gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did

I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone

Messrs. Fisher and Co.
North Sydney, June 25,18%
Gentlemen, —I cannot speak too highly of your excellent
preparation of KOLA NUT. As a tonic, I found it far
superior to anything of the kind I ever used, and have
strongly recommended it to several friends, all of whom
(after taking it) are enthusiastic in their praise of it. Kola
Nut Tonic has a most beneficial effect after an attack oi
INFLUENZA ; on some of my acquaintances it has pro-
duced wonderful effects, particularly in strengthening the
muscles of chest and limbs. Many of my cycling friends
swear by it. I notice its use has been adopted by the
Alpine Club as a STIMULANT and NUTRIENT in moun-
tain-climbing expeditions, &c., as it generally increases
the power of the LUNGS and keeps off muscular fatigue,
and will prove invaluable to athletes. I feel confident
Kola Nut Tonic will have a large consumption, for those
who once try it will always keep it in store.—Yours faith-
fully,
CHARLES WISEIIEART,
Willoughby.
NO CYCLIST SHOULD BE WITHOUT THIS REMARK-
ABLE INVIGORATOR, ESPECIALLY LADIES.
EVERY SINGER, AUCTIONEER, and PUBLIC
SPEAKER should take KOLA NUT TONIC.
A recent issue of the Planters’ Monthly contains a
description of this remarkable nut and its uses :
“ Kola has the property of staying hunger, whilst sup-
porting the struggle for existence.
“ If a supply of nuts had been included in Mr. Stanley's
outfit his men would not have suffered so terribly for want
of animal food.
“ As might be expected , the value of Kola increases as
it makes its way into the interior of Africa, and some of
the tribes farthest removed from the sea pay for the dry
powder an equal weight of gold-dust.
“In a despatch from Mr. George Alexander Stevens,
Her Majesty’s Consul at Bahai, he calls attention to the
great powers of endurance in lifting heavy loads and
transporting them to long distances in the tropical
climate, attributed to the free use of Kola Bean. An old
African, after biting a piece of the magic Bean, lifted 17b
English pounds weight on to his head and carried the
same for a distance of four miles.
“Still another merit is named, however, which will
interest the temperance party. The negros who chew
Kola Nut have no desire to drink rum, and hence save
money and retain their strength.”
A woman—whose name under the circumstances cannot
be given—came into our shop the other day, with tears of
gratitude in her eyes, and said, “ My husband used to
come home on Saturdays DRUNK, but he has been taking
Kola Nut Tonic for four weeks, and now comes home
quite SOBER and places the whole of his wages in mv
hands. God bless you ! ”

The Papuans are addicted to the old heathen
practice of depositing a man’s weapons on his
grave. The cooking utensils and grass petticoat
are also laid on the grave of the woman. Strange
to say, the people who do this have no belief in a
future state.

Blacks belonging to a camp near a little
N.S.W. coastal town were making good hauls of
fi-b jvhich were scarce elsewhere at the time, and
were advised to ship a lot to Sydney. A big
parcel was sent up by the steamer, and .Tacky, the
most truculent buck of the tribe, was deputed to
accompany them and look after the business.
“ Goo’-bye, you pfeller,” said Jacky, as he blithely
jumped aboard ; “ I bring you anythin’ back, eh ? ”
One old gin called out: “ Yes, you bring Billy one
pannikin and Mary one pannikin, and send tel’-
gram how much you getta fish.” Two days after-
wards the expectant tribe received a wire : “ Fish
sold, in 2,” and when the steamer arrived there
was a consignment of two pannikins but no Jacky,
who was having a large time in Sydney on the
proceeds of the fish. In about a week another
wire was received from the absent one: “Coming
back to-morrow.” Jacky’s arrival was greeted
with much joy, but he did not deign to acknow-
ledge the demonstration and walked straight camp-
wards, a jabbering procession at his heels. “ Wha’
for you nfeller follow me ? ” he asked at last.
“ Gibbit money for fish,” they shouted. “What
money you talk about ? ” he asked with a long-
suffering expression—“ don’t I send you two pan-
nikin ?. Don’t I send two telegram ? Those ting
cost plenty money—what you dam fool think ? ”

A' Chinaman turned up at a N.S.W.
country sale-yard, the other day, and was beguiled
by the auctioneer into buying for <£3 an old
broken-down scarecrow, rising 17, and totally
blind. Next day the horse was harnessed to a
vegetable-cart, and, having been started off by a
few gentle words from John, he proceeded to walk
through the gate before it was opened for him. In
his mild outburst of anger the Chow tapped the
horse none too lightly on the head, which sent him
back at a great rate until he was brought to a
standstill by the shanty, which got mixed with
the, back of"the cart. Nothing would induce the
poor horse to leave his anchorage until a friendly
yellow neighbor let off a bundle of crackers be-
hind his back legs ; and then the animal showed
he could pull by taking half the hut away with
him. After trying to work the horse for two days
the Chinaman brought him back to the sale-yards
and told the auctioneer to sell him for £3 10s.
Two hours afterwards the horse was returned: to
his former owner for lfis. fid. —the Chow getting
15s. 3d. He then departed telling the auctioneer
that he would be up next day to buy “oldliorsee—
no likee tarn young horsee —too muchee smashum
cart.” True to his word the Chinaman arrived
early next morning, and the second horse put up,
which was in a cart and had a neat set of harness
on, took John’s eye at once. He started bidding
against the auctioneer’s buttoner, and finally
secured the animal for £2 9s. The Chow received
a great ovation from the crowd when he led his
horse away after paying ; and he was smiling all
over. He didn’t smile next day when the horse
played precisely the same tricks as the one he
sold, and an intelligent countryman discovered it
was the same horse, clipped, and with three of its
legs and its face painted white. The Chinaman
now sells vegetables out of baskets. Chinese are a
dishonest lot.

Dear Bulletin, —Has Mr. R. A. Fraser
never heard of the automatically-closing doors
applied to the railway-carriages of the district
railway (underground), London? They worked
admirably and did all that was demanded of them
—more. For it was found that the doors being
kept shut till the train arrived at a standstill—4os.
fine for alighting from a train in motion —com-
pelled a longer wait at each station ; the average
traveller drops off before the train stops, and
is never fined unless he falls down. Automatically-
closing doors were abolished and the trains were
run “ontime.” — Wubrym.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Three notes a week and a shanty in
England 1 Blow England, anyway ! ’Sowever,
it’ll be better than graftin’ a feller’s bloomin’ soul
out for nothin’ in this Gawd-forgot patch.”
Thus Silas Neame, shiftless “ cocky,” of Back-
gumbah, New South Wales, to the wild-haired,
freckled, flat-chested female he called wife, but
who neither honored nor obeyed him. He, native-
born, had just received legal tidings that his
grand-uncle in England, dying, had bequeathed
him a house and Al5O a year, on condition that he
(Silas) Tesided at Ashbourne, Kent, England. So
Silas sold his mean milkers, razor-backed hogs,
spavined horses, and decomposed implements,
slouched to Sydney, and there took steamer. Two
persons only, one a little, the other exceedingly,
regretted his departure —his daughter Cis, a bush
beauty and coquette of 16, who was “ryther
mashed ” on young Sam Levin, stockrider on
Backgumbah station, and Sam, desperately fond
of the girl, and heartbroken at parting.
“ But you’ll waitfor a feller, Cis ? I’ll go to thish-
yer new diggins at Teroarer, make my pile, and
come to England and splice you inside of two
years.”
Cis kissed and promised. Yet, bitten by the
tarantula of change, thought much of the possible
pleasures ensuing and little of Sam. He, a man
and earnestly in love, was, as goes without saying,
a fool. Within two years, having scooped .£BOO at
Teroarer, he was in Ashbourne, asking for Cis.
Silas, with strong beers oozing out of the corners
of his mouth, swore rings round him when his
daughter’s name was mentioned. The woman
threw her apron over her head and whimpered
like a locked-out dog. Kind neighbors were, how-
ever, ready to tell all about Cis—how she had
“ ’ooked it, a matter o’ nine month afore, with a
swell chap fro’ they blarsted cavalary barricks at
Canterbury,” and had been seen in Lunnon, “ a
raddled Jezebull! ”
To London Sam went seeking Cis, and there,
after months, and by what Occidentals call coinci-
dence and Orientals, wiser, kismet, found her, in
hospital, dying. She knew him, and gasped out
a name. The nurse supplied other particulars.
Sam sought nothing else. He did not even attend
the girl’s funeral. He was too drunk. He was
drunk and mad for many days, and—then !
* * * *
“For inspection—port arms!” General
foot-parade for the 24th Hussars, one sweltering
afternoon at Ferozebagh, Bengal. Captain Nether-
gat—with delicate irony the men called him
“Leathergut”—was about to inspect “ B ” troop
on their troop parade-ground. The troop-sergeant-
major had inspected them, and a sucking sub-
altern, whom the men swore at almost audibly,
but without vice—for they loathed foot-parades,
the sun was hot and their helmets tight—had,
without comprehension, nosed their buttons and
pouch-belts. Called to attention by their captain,
him they cursed silently, but atrociously. For
they hated him more than all bad things known in
earth or suspected in hell. He had exchanged
from the infantry some two years before, a fact in
itself condemnatory to horsemen. Added thereto,
he, “regimental as a button-stick” in barrack-room
or on foot-parade, flinched, when mounted, at
rough field-days, rode coward at a charge, and was
unmitigated bully and tyrant always. Many
times had “B” troop, with much pretended sweat-
ing at bit-reins and more surreptitious spurring,
tried to ride over him at brigade field-days. Had
he led the troop into action he would never have
ridden out alive. Two score of troopers would
have made that their business. And Nethergat
knew it and loved his men accordingly. He in-
spected them as if they were lepers. “ ’Tisu’t
exackly what the gory toe soldier says; it’s the
way the sanguinary swine says it and looks at a
man,” the men agreed. Now, he passed in silence
the first two files, halting, contemptuous, at the
third.
“ What’s this fellow’s name, Sergeant-Major
Dillon?”
“Evans, sir.”
Nethergat knew this well, but that form of in-
sult is ever effective.
“ Well, Evans is beastly dirty, as usual.”
The troop sergeant-major said nothing. He
knew his captain lied and that “Skew” Evans
was, as ever, spick and span.
The man himself stared straight to his front,
his face impassive and rigid as of a Hindoo graven
image. He was well used to this hazing from his
captain.
“ What service has he, sergeant-major ? ”
“Eighteen months, sir; joined the dep6t at
Canterbury just after you embarked for India.
Only been out here six months, sir. ”
_ “ Aw ! Thought he was a damn recruit. Make
him a prisoner when the dismiss sounds.” He
continued his inspection.
“Shoulder arms! —stand at ease!—stand easy !”
Said Dillon to his captain as they waited the
“March on,” “What crime shall I put against
private Evans?”
“Dirty on general parade, of course.”
“ Beg pardon, sir ; cleanest man on parade.
Colonel won’t like it, sir.”
The captain bored his teeth, prior to exercising
his large gift of verbal offensiveness, but checked
himself. He had reasons for placating Dillon.
“ Do as you damn please,” he snarled. “There’s
the trumpet ! troop, tenshun ! —fours right !
quick march ! ”
Two old moustaches, just off guard, “ foxed ”
the inspection from “B ” troop bungalow. Said
one : “ What’s that pig Leatherguts always down
on Skew Evans for ? Skew’s a good man, ain’t
he ? ”
“Yes, makin’s of a bloomin’ smart hussar —
good rider, saveys horses, straight comrade,” said
the other, Skew’s chum. “Some day,” he
observed reflectively, “one o’ these ’ere Board
School ’cruities with an uncut tail ’ll put a bullet
in old Leatherguts.”
“ Skew will, I expect, if the hinfernal swaddy
don’t let up on him.”
“ .No, I axed Skew oncet if he didn’t feel that
way. Skew looked black as a dust-devil, but he
says, ‘ let ’im rip; he’ll be bailed up worse than
shooting one of these days. I’m on his track.’
Adjutant told Skew he’d transfer him to ‘ C ’
troop, and give him the lance stripe.”
“ Why didn’t he go ? ”
“Loves his dear capting too much. Said he
wouldn’t leave ‘B ’ troop for no money. ‘More
confounded fool you,’ says the Adjutant. But
Dillon thinks a heap of Evans, and has saved him
time and again.”
“ Skew a good scholard ? ”
“Fust chop. Wasn’t bad when he joined the
depdt, and been attendin’ school ever since. He’s
a quiet bloke, too. Takes his beer, but don’t go
large. Got one of tlvun there foto fakements ;
best bloomin’ fotografier in the station.”
“ Leatherguts don’t shop him so often now ? ”
“ No, last time he clinked’im for ‘ dumb insol-
ence ’ —said he looked disrespeckful—old Daddy,
the colonel, says, ‘ Captain Nethergat,’ says he,
‘ you hardly seem to know what constitoots a good
soldier, not in the cavalry at least,’ he says;
‘ when we’ve a good man we keep him out of
trouble, not ram him into it. Dismissed ! ’ says
good old Daddy. The capting he gives Skew par-
ticular sheoke, same as before, but he don’t put
’im in the guard report. ”
The other summed up: “I’ve got a bloomin’
rupee ; let’s go down to the bazar and drink it.
They’re all marched on now. ”
Troop-sergeant-major Dillon,. “B” troop,
was admitted by his officers to be the best, and by
the men the smartest and straightest non-com. in
the corps. He was a good disciplinarian—a just
man and a merciful. Therefore “If ” troop would
—for that is a cavalry-man’s way—have ridden
after him to the very gates of Sheol, through them,
and out the other side. He had held his rank for
years; frugal and keen, he had saved and made
money—as his captain knew. But Dillon had the
ghastliest skeleton in his cupboard—as the whole
regiment knew. He had been six months married
to the 17-year-old daughter of orderly-room ser-
geant Jeff and Johanna his wife. The vocabulary
of the 24th was insufficient to paint the iniquities
of Mrs. Dillon’s mamma. She drank, she swore
in a manner the most seand t ;ooper might envy
but not emulate, she corrected Jeff with sauce-
pans, crockery and barr.».ck-roo.n furniture ; she
had poisoned him, ineffectual y, twice ; her amours
would have made an English society leader a
Begum, or a painted Hindoo goddess blush. .'Six
months back her daughter flitted through che
pqlcherj, fair-haired, shy, and, seemingly, virgin-
ally innocent. Married, and under her
tutelage, she developed most of that mother’s
vices. Dillon’s modest quarters became as the
abode of the damned. His young wife’s misde-
meanors were as miscellaneous as notorious ;
everyone but Dillon knew that the .person with
whom her name had recently been most frequently
coupled was—Captain Nethergat. And, at last,
he knew that also. When evil fortune thus smites
a man honorable, proud and punctilious, one who,
from the nature of things, might not obtain
divorce, two cour es only are open to him. Of
these Dillon promptly chose one.
* * * *
The night before “B” troop commenced
its annual musketry course, Sergeant Major
Dillon was very busy. Before watchsetting there
was not a pie in dispute in any man’s accounts,
not a horse shoe, not a spare nail out of place.
The last man he sent for was “ Skew ” Evans.
“Evans, you’re a man can keep your mouth
shut.”
“ I think so, Sergeant-Major.”
“I know it; I’ve watched you close. We’re
speaking as man to man, not as sergeant-major to
private soldier.”
“ Thank you,” said the other.
“Listen now, and serve me as I’ve tried to
serve you. Be at my bungalow, in the verandah
at north end, to-morrow morning at 7.25 by the


Contractors for Government stores tender
at ruinously low prices for items not wanted in
quantity, at the same time keeping up values on
items extensively needed. A Vic. contractor some
years back included in a railways tender leather
buckets at a shilling each. The price was so low
that Vic. Railways supplied every station with
leather buckets in place of the iron or zinc article.
That contractor lost =£soo through astutely listing
=£l buckets at 12d. each.
Mr. Ferderli, wine-expert at Dookie (Vic.)
Agricultural College, has produced some valuable
evidence of the improvement that can be made
upon ordinary wines by the use of a cultivated
levure in the fermenting process. A “ levured ”
sherry is found incomparably superior to the same
grape-juice fermented in the old ordinary way.
And this notwithstanding than an ordinary Vic.
sherry is more true to its European name than any
of the other yellow wines raised from the soil.
The Q. Kanaka trouble seems to be gradu-
ally settling itself. Sept. 1 the Helena returned
to Bundaberg, after a five months’ trip, with only
32 “recruits.” She had been chartered to bring
90, but the “ boys ” wouldn’t recruit. She tried
the Hebrides group of islands only, and “plenty
fellow yam, ” as a good harvest, was more potent
in the eyes of the islanders than a trip to Q. The
cost of the Helena’s voyage may be roughly set
down at =£looo, so the cheap labor must have cost
over =£3o a head landed at Bundaberg.
Prophet Varley’s pyrotechnics on the Papal
Conference of 1890 :
Inside the venerable pile of St. Peter’s sat the great
company of the Ecclesiastics. The heavens were black
to almost Egyptian darkness. A storm of unparalleled
continuance and violence held the whole city. Lightnings
flashed in vivid, rapid and terrifying succession. Thun-
ders like a thousand parks of artillery crashed, rolled and-
reverberated over the whole scene. No wonder that
nature herself, as at the time of the Spanish Armada,
lifted up her voice in tempestuous protest against the
confederated attempt to usurp the attributes ai.d func-
tions which alone pertain to the Living God.
Certainly. And Tarawera erupted because little
Rangatunipito sneaked into his uncle’s whare in
the night and went through his trousers for
eighteenpence which the beery warrior had found
under a poker-table down at the village pub.

guard-room clock. Have you a watch ? ”
“ Yes.”
“ Then set it by the guard-room clock to-night.
Bring that kodak thing of yours with you to-
morrow. At 7.30 I will call you in. Then, photo-
graph everything you see in the room — everything,
mind. Take two or three photographs, if neces-
sary. You will touch nothing, speak to no one,
and never show the photographs, unless I—unless
you know you ought to. Do you understand ? ”
The man reflected. His face quivered a little.
“ I think so,” he said at last, sadly.
“ Say it all over.”
Evans repeated the instructions.
“That’s right—be on time, to the second ; it’s
important. ”
Dillon paused. “If you should ever want ad-
vice on this, and I cannot give it, speak to the
Quartermaster-sergeant; he’s my friend, and will
be yours. There’s nothing more.”
Skew went out, but presently returned.
“ Give me all that in writing, please, sergeant-
major.”
The other looked at him hard. “ You’re right,”
was all he said. He sat down and wrote; then
handed Evans the paper, rose, and stretched out
his hand. They looked in each other’s eyes. Each
recognised a man. “ Good-night, my lad.”
“Good— bye, sergeant-major.”
• ♦ * •
Next morning the troop went to musketry.
Sergeant-Major Dillon’s name appeared on the
sick-report. But he did not go to hospital. A
farrier of “ B ” troop, coming in early from shoot-
ing, was hailed by his sergeant-major.
“Have you cleaned your carbine yet, Farrier
Jones ?”
“ Not yet, sergeant-major ; I’m just in from the
butts.”
“Lend it to me, then. I want to shoot some-
thing, and if I use your carbine it’ll save dirtying
my own. ”
* * * *
At 7.25 a.m., by the guard-room clock,
Skew Evans stood in the north verandah of
Dillon’s bungalow—his kodak ready. At 7.30 a
voice, loud and clear, rang out:
“Now, Evans !”
There rang also the report of a carbine, with the
twang a bullet gives. Skew paused, paled, lifted
the curtain and looked. On the bed, the roof of
his head blown off, Dillon —already dead, a cord
stretched from his foot to the trigger of a carbine
lying across his breast. The impulse of Evans
was to rush to the dead man. But, recalling his
instructions, he fixed his kodak, touched the
button, and the sun limned the tragedy. On the
table by the bed lay two large canvas bags, seem-
ingly tilled with rupees, two large official enve-
lopes, and one smaller package. He photographed
the table. Then, hearing a step, concealed him-
self where he could command the room and the
button of his kodak. One entered, ejaculated,
viewed Dillon’s dead body, and lingered.
Once—twice—thrice, the button of the kodak
tapped !
* * * *
Dillon’s suicide caused universal sorrow,
but not surprise. Surprise, however, touched pro-
fundity when it was known that “B” troop
lacked their month’s pay, because Dillon had
made away with every anna of troop money in his
possession. So Captain Nethergat sorrowfully
reported to the colonel. He had, he said, “long
suspected poor Dillon of rash speculation.” The
accounts, he explained, were scrupulously correct,
only no farthing could be found of the large bal-
ance m Dillon’s hands. That afternoon, without
military honors, Dillon was buried. The regiment
cursed venomously when Nethergat, temporarily
acting adjutant, yelped across the parade-ground
to the non-com. commanding the funeral:
“ Trot, with that body ! Trot, confound you !
What the devil d’ye mean by walking with a
suicide ? ”
• * * *
A few nights afterwards the orderly-
corporal of “B” troop sang out—“ Evans! it’s
your turn to take the order-book to the captain’s
bungalow. Look out, he’ll bite your bloomin’
head off ! ”
“ Oh, it’s you, confound you ! ” said Nethergat,
with accustomed politeness. He opened the book
where marked by a piece of paper, “ You fool,
these are not the orders of the day !” His eye
caught the marker, ‘ ‘ Hello! what the deuce is
this ? ”
It was an unmounted photograph—Dillon lying
dead on his bed.
Evans saluted, “Beg pardon, sir—next page.”
The captain turned the leaf. There, another
photograph—Dillon’s table, the bags of money,
and the letters.
Nethergat stared, at first stupidly, then shook a
little, staggered, and sat down before his desk.
“ I —l don’t understand,” he muttered.
“ There are three more photographs there, Cap-
tain Nethergat; perhaps you’d better look at
them.” “Skew’s” tone was changed; it was
strident and commanding. The captain, dazed
and trembling, turned to the three photographs.
One —a man lifting from a table two canvas
bags.
Two —the same man covering with a military
cloak the hand holding the bags.
Three—the man departing through the south
door of Dillon’s bungalow. In his left hand two
official envelopes.
The man was—Captain Nethergat!
The captain looked, then, realising what it was
at which he looked, turned livid. At length
speech came and the bully started up, blustrous.
“You infernal scoundrel, how came you there?”
“ By Sergeant-Major Dillon’s written order.”
“ You lie, you ruffian ! Give it to me ! ”
Evans laughed unpleasantly. “ Let me make
things plain. I have Dillon’s written order, given '
the night before his death. I saw and photo-
graphed the bags of rupees on the table. I saw
you steal the rupees and two letters —Oh, don’t
threaten me ! I have you fixed, Captain Nether-
gat. I picked up, after you left, something which
escaped you —a letter containing a statement of
moneys in the bags, of Dillon’s frequent loans to
you, and your receipts. (Keep your hands down
or I’ll kill you). Those bags and the accounts
which were in the envelopes are in your big safe
there.”
The captain looked at the safe.
“ You needn’t look there,” said the other ; “ I
squared your khitmagar —who hates you and has
left you —to steal the keys of your safe. I have
them.”
Nethergat’s face i witched horribly ; his furtive,
evil eyes glanced from side to side. Then, like
lightning, he whipped open a drawer of his desk
and groped wildly therein.
The private sneered. “No use shooting. All
the proofs are in good hands. I’m not a new-
chum. Besides, your revolver isn’t there. Your
khitmagar hid that. There’s something in the
drawer will serve your turn better —prussic acid.
Thank your khitmagar again. ”
The two men glared at one another. Then, for
the first time, the private lost self-control and
burst out: “ Who are you, thief, seducer, coward,
and liar, that you should die as good soldiers die?
Poison yourself like the rat you are ! ”
At this the pitiful craven grovelled—” Good
God! Evans, you won t ruin me? Ive been
narsn ; it was all tor your good—a young soldier,
you know ! Swear you won’t split. Of course
you won t. 111 give you every rupee in the bags
—troop money and Dillons money, too, though
1 m internally pushed. I 1 buy you out-do any-
f n £ lt > man > t hlnk of my people ! Think
disgrace to my friends !
, friends ! Did you think of the disgrace
to Dillon? Did you—did you think of the dis-
grace to Cis Neame, whom you ruined and left,
you cursed pariah? Did you think of the dis-
grace to me, that worshipped every hair of her
head? Die, you dog ! die by poison, and thank
me for letting you ! I’ve followed you two years
on the off-chance of killing you myself.”
“ Cis—Neame ! My God ! Cis— ! Then you
ar ® ~— ”
The man that hates you most on earth and
would hunt you over the rampants of hell— her
sweetheart—Sam Levin ! ”
* * » *
The next day Captain Nethergat, 24th
Hussars, occupied a suicide’s grave, and no shadow
or stain remained on Dillon’s fame, But it was
not good that a man knowing what “Skew”
Evans knew should remain in the regiment. He
was permitted to purchase his discharge. Last
tune 1 met him he was a hatter ’on the western
ranges of Maoruand, and we talked over this true
story.

The Bulletin has received these truly
touching verses and publishes them as a text for
some parson who may feel inclined to hold forth
on the pessimism and irreverence of the Australian
backblocks youth :
ONE LAST APPEAL.
O, Lord of mercy, speak me fair, my last frail hope is thee.
What is the use, the earthly use, the blanky use of ME ?
Is there all round this w ide, wide world a hope for such
as I?
O, Lord of mercy, tell me straight, and let me live or die.
Was I just born to hang around, and mope and cadge and
bum ?
Or just for folks to frighten kids at what they might
become ?
Am I to blame for what I am, or is it simply luck ?
Or fell I from Thy pottery a hunk of useless muck ?
For I’m well-grown and strong and stout, my life throbs
loud within ;
I am not steeped, I’ll swear I’m not, in what the world
calls sin ;
I’ve never harmed a single soul, they can’t say that of me ;
Yet here I am—a stepping-stone for all humanity !
Shall ever I possess in life a pound to call my own ?
(I might as well express a wish to own the Torrid Zone).
You know, O Lord, I’ve tried my best to earn the world’s
bright gold,
Yet here I am, a failure—Ugh !—and twenty-three years
old.
Now I’ve a credit balance of, say, fifty years to run ;
I’ll write you out a cheque in full for every blessed one ;
And if you tell me that in life there is no use for me,
’Tis best to cash it right away, as far as I can see.
But if the world holds prospects fair—if I’m to share its
bliss ;
If fame awaits, or Glory bright, or Love’s delirious kiss;
If I’m to bask, a petted child, ’neath Fortune’s nod and
beck,
I pray that in your mercy, Lord, you’ll not present the
cheque 1

“ My Dear Mr. BONNINGTON. Theatre Royal, Sydney, April 20, 1896.
Allow me, on behalf of Mrs. Holt, to thank you very sincerely for your
kind thought in sending her, on Saturday, a bottle of your famed Irish Moss. I may say that
it is an old and valued friend of ours, and I am sure our esteem of its virtues will be
strengthened by the acquaintance with it which we now renew, through your good agency
“ With all sincere wishes for your success and well-being,
“1 remain, yours cordially, BLAND HOLT.”
