History and Myth
The difficulties in the way of keeping any-
thing like an accurate and authentic record
of human affairs are far greater than at first
sight they might seem. Even the greatest
events are seldom seen in anything like
their true focus at the time; and afterwards
when evidence is collected the ideas of what
really occurred are as various as the minds
of the witnesses. Yet once an idea becomes
fixed it is exceedingly hard to remove. One
so-called historian cheerfully follows another
without regard for the fact that the first
who wrote about the matter did so on very
inadequate knowledge. Practically every
Roman historian tells the tale of Cleopatra
and Julius Caesar, even elaborating it and
excusing the great man for the part he
played in it; yet there is not one tittle of
real evidence to prove that Caesar ever met
the lady. The yarn is told by Plutarch —a
writer of historical fiction —and every com-
mentator, while he dismisses a lot of the
tale, clings to the rest. Additions have been
made during the years; and anyone who
might be inclined to challenge any point is
met by the statement that such and such a
writer believes it. So authority builds on
authority, though the actual foundation is
likely to be myth. In a similar way the
tale of Oliver Cromwell as the arch-hypocrite
and bloody monster of his age grew and in-
creased until it was blown out by Tom Car-
lyle ; yet so great was its grip that many
intelligent people still refuse to see the pic-
ture of the big-handed, big-hearted ex-brewer,
who fought harder, prayed harder, worked
harder and loved better than any other
man of liis time. Tradition in this case aided
the repeating historian, but that tradition
largely came through the mean, intriguing,
diseased persons about the court of Charles
11. to whom a man like Oliver was alto-
gether too clean and strong to be pleasant.
In Ireland the tradition was helped by
religious feeling; yet it is very much to be
doubted whether ordinary Irish folk in the
districts crossed by the Parliamentary army
shared much of the hatred of his name. Look
up Cromwell’s reply to the defenders of
Tipperary when they made a pretence of seek-
ing the safety of the people in Irishtown in
the terms of capitulation. The English
general told the royalist leaders plainly that
they might leave the Irish people out of the
argument, as they were far safer with him
than with them.
But these are matters of some time ago;
and, however it may be with former times,
it is generally held that the story of the
nineteenth century is reasonably complete
and accurate. An article on "The John
Brown Myth” in a recent number of the
American Mercury shows how far this is
from being the case. Brown, it appears, was
an unsuccessful dealer and trader who late
in life took to horse- and cattle-stealing. The
best regions for his operations were those
where feeling over the slavery question had
already led to minor raids and counter-raids.
Naturally Brown’s thefts and murders were
looked upon as having political significance,
and so were condoned by one party. Having
won a bogus reputation, he came to Boston
and collected more than 20,000 dollars, in
cash or munitions of war, to carry on the
good work. His one blow in the cause of
freedom was a muddled attack on Harper’s
Ferry, a Government arsenal. His avowed
intention _ was. to arm the surrounding
negroes with pikes and carry an insane cam-
paign of violence through the Virginian plan-
tations. The weak spot in the affair was
that no negroes had been told about it and
that there was no evidence to show that
they would revolt if they had been told.
After a struggle, Brown surrendered to
Colonel Lee and was duly hanged. His
papers show that he lied regularly and well
in his correspondence and in his speech be-
fore execution, that he stole and murdered
f° r nis own hand, and that he did not care
a dump about the negro or his sufferings.
Other evidence shows that he was not par-
ticularly adventurous or brave and that his
raids and schemes frequently failed through
hesitation and bad judgment. Yet this man
is probably, after Washington and Lincoln,
the greatest mythical hero of the United
States; and his career ended as late as 1859.
Half a continent, with some assistance from
the rest of the world, still sings that "his
soul is marching on”; and the proof that
lie was merely a horse-stealer and exploiter
of public sentiment will make no difference
to his place as a hero. Our own Ned Kelly
was, in plain fact, a man of quite Brown’s
moral sense, with a good deal of quality
which Brown never possessed; and it only
needed some hint of attachment to a cause—
any old cause would have done—to have
lifted Ned to the same pinnacle of glory.
But history is always in the making;
and it is good guessing that our own age
will furnish some remarkable instances of
the myth. It will be very surprising
indeed if Henry Lawson is not found
riding buckjumpers within the next 50
years; and it is almost certain that passages
in his work will be used to prove that he
fought gallantly in the South African War,
if not in the recent larger disturbance. Had
the Marwick egg been a well-directed bomb,
nothing could have kept Billv Hughes from
a place among the national gods of the
future. Already our Lindsay Gordon myth
is very strongly set; and thousands of people
who do not know poetry from rice-custard
are willing to acclaim him. Yet if he had
not ridden steeplechases and taken his own
life it is tolerably certain that he would be
little better remembered than our worthv
first singer, Charles Harpur. But it is the
deeds of our soldiers in Gallipoli and France
that will form both our best and most dan-
ge™u» tuition- „ The memory of hardship
and bitter toil fades fast; the splendid
achievements themselves grow dim in out-
line ; the irregularities, breaches of discipline
and humors of the campaigns are exalted
into an undue prominence. This is good to
a point. Much that happened is best left
Prague and allowed to pass into a misty
realm of half reality; but the general effect
of a tradition that our men did great things
by not caring how they did them is likely
in the end to have a slackening effect on
the national character. It may even be
necessary in the near future to invent a
myth or two with a view to counteracting
such a tradition—a myth about the absolute
discipline and order which prevailed in some
super-Digger battalions. Such heroic stories
would not, after all, be so much at variance
with fact. Admiral Wemyss is merely the
latest ‘to vouch for the fine Digger discipline
—the silence_of the Landing was proof
enough for the Admiral of the highest form
of the substance.
C.O.M.
Phymes for Children
Encouraged by Alice R. Vines (R.P.
13/3/24) and M.G.S. (R.P. 7/2/24), who
have written on the subject of children and
poetry, X make my plea for an Australian
sentiment in the verses we teach our Aus-
tralian children. I have been a teacher;
I am now a mother of three, the eldest
aged eight, and I have had ample scope for
finding what children really like in verse.
They like animal jingles and fairy verses,
and they love verses with a bit of fun in
them. I penned this jingle for my kiddies,
and how they did chuckle over it!
A centipede looked very wise,
And squinted in one of, his eyes,
When a goose, on one leg
Said, “I’ll bet you an egg
That footwear is due for a rise.”
Another time, when we hg.d exhausted all
the nursery rhymes, Jack Horner, 80-Peep,
Miss Muffet and their playmates, I suggested
this:—•
Little Jack Hacket
. Sat on a packet
Eating some peanuts and cake,
Along came a lizard.
Jack said, “Who, pray, is it ?”
And the lizard said, “I’m a big snake.”
They are only nonsense, of course, but I
found the kiddies jingled them over to them-
selves again and again. They were a change
from the old rhymes, and children love a
change as well as their elders do.
Only last week my eldest girl came home
from school reciting the latest rhymes she
had learned. She informed me that
Chill December brings the snow,
Makes the feet and fingers glow ;
January brings the rain
Beating on the window-pane.
It was a rhyme from an English school-
book, or a reprint of an English
book, and the child had had no explanation
of the difference in the seasons here and
there. I suggested that we learn this instead:
December sun gleams overhead
To turn the cheeks of cherries red;
In January surf and sand
Are things we best can understand.
So I wrote the months and their message
for us. The child agreed it seemed a much
better idea than the school-book story.
Again, the children bring from school
stories of meadows and brooks. They are
strange words to them, and do not stir their
emotions half as much as “paddocks” and
“creeks” would, although our Australian
synonyms are not so musical. For a long
time wo listened to the popular type of
American song, and tried to grow enthusias-
tic over Dixieland and Arizona, but we found
Croajingalong and Gundagai much more to
our liking, and the popular songs to-day have
a tendency to give Australians a sentiment
they understand. Why can’t we do the same
thing with our children’s nursery rhymes?
May Gibbs has made our children love her
gum-nut babies, Dennis has given us “The
Glugs of Gosh,” but there is room for much
more.
It seems, to me that the Education De-
partments in the various States should be
awakened to this need. To-day, if a book
of Australian nursery rhymes were sub-
mitted to publishers here, it would not get
a hearing. First, there must be the demand
for the goods, and in order to create that
demand those responsible for our children’s
education must be shown that there is some-
thing wrong with “Chill December brings
the snow,” and rhymes of meadows and
brooks, of buttercups and daisies.
I wrote the following lines for a bush song
for my kiddies, and I found they wanted
it told them over and over again:—
The coach was made of mossy bowers,
The wheels were white clematis flowers;
The reins, were wild “love” twisted twice
To hold in check two frisky mice;
The pale bush-laurel formed a cup
In which a tiny elf sat up ;
He drove this carriage through the mom
To catch the night-elves, spent and worn,
Who flee before the sprites of day—
‘Come, mount the coach and drive away.”
Then I told them a story of mushrooming
which rhymed this way:—
The autumn morn was crystal clear and bright
.A, tempting paddock like a carpet spread,
While diamond dewdrops, nurslings of the night
Before the sun-king’s gaze took wing and fled. ’
So through the rails I hastened o’er the grass
mushroom basket swinging in the breeze,
While drowsy cows, unheeding, let me pass,
And butcher-birds sang choruses and glees.
The fairies’ tents these earthy mushrooms are,
rr l , ncl the night the fairies skip and play,
Till, with the fading of the latest star,
They leave their tents and softly slip away.
So, as my basket fills with snowy heaps,
And clusters more arise to greet my sight
I m looking for some fairy who still sleeps ;
But all are gone until the call of night.
Of course, it is not poetry, but it is giving
to the youngsters stories they can under-
stand, in a setting with which they are
familiar. Is there not room for more of
this sort of thing in our school books’
RURY LAPSCOMBE TAYLOR.
Joan of Arc—an Apologia, not
an Apology!
In the gloomy record of drunkenness,
guzzle, and syphilis which makes up history
and the lives of “the great,” Joan of Arc
still remains the one pure white angel of
war, and more worthy of reverence than any
of the saints. Out of reverence for her
memory I left my authoritv for the statement
tdiat she never menstruated in the original
Old French, because the actual words were
rather coarse; and, moved by the startling
prurience of some reviewers, who seem to

The Burroughs Duplex
Will Save Time in
Analysing Your Sales
ADDS
SUBTRACTS
MULTIPLIES
DIVIDES
Because the Burroughs Duplex (Two Adding Machines in
One) gives Group Totals and a Grand Total automati-
cally, it saves time and money in obtaining such informa-
tion as sales by clerks, departments, lines or branches and
total sales; expense by departments and total expenses;
costs by jobs and total costs, and in handling other figure
work where individual and grand totals are required.
Note the form reproduced below. As the various
columns were listed and added, the machine printed, but
“remembered” and accumulated the individual totals so
that the grand total shown in the last column was
available immediately.
Thus the Duplex actually accomplishes two jobs at one
time, and offers you the easiest and quickest way for
obtaining the information you need to make more money.
Like all Burroughs machines, the Duplex is built to last a
business life-time by the largest manufacturers of adding,
book-keeping and calculating machines in the world!
Ask us to demonstrate the Burroughs Duplex on your
own work. You will then be able to judge for yourself
how valuable this double adding machine will be to you;
how it will save you money and give you the information
you need about your business. Such demonstration will
cost you nothing, nor place you under any obligation to buy.

OPP. G.P.O. For Service SYDNEY
have wilfully mistaken my meaning, I now
venture to explain the psychological idea
that influenced me to an audience of mtelli
gent people, who, though they need not
agree with me, will at least take the tro >
to understand. And nowhere is theie a
Lore intelligent audience than the readers of
th AsfiT showed in my book, “Post Mortem
and as Anatole France showed m his late ot
Joan of Arc”—we really know nothing about
Joan apart from the reports of the trial w Inch
burned her, and the “rehabilitation trial
which, 20 years afterwards, pretended to
restore her to goodness—or at least to make
things unpleasant for the fanatics who had
handed her over to the powers of evil, from
the undoubted fact that her visions anil
mysticism began at the time when her sex
should have shown itself in the usual man-
ner, I inferred that probably that mighty
power, in its struggles to reach her
consciousness, had changed her mind in
the direction of seeing visions, and ot a
fierce and saintly virginity. One Ameri-
can reviewer actually, after giving me
the lecture that he thought was my due,
informed me that a certain ranting mamad,
in the time Of Queen Anne, Christian Davies,
had fought through campaigns far more
Strenuous than Joan’s, thus proving that a
woman could act the soldier quite as well as
ft man* As if 1 ever denied it! Although
tile story of Christian Davies was quite
familiar to me, my whole point was that
Joan Wfts bbi ft ranting, tearing imeliad.
She did her work entirely through the. spirit
—that is td say, speaking Of the fifteenth
century; by what we should now Call super-
stition* Although she was twice wounded
she never killed anybody in battle, and indeed,
in her own words, used to carry her banner
in order that she might not have to kill any-
body.
The whole question of religious experience
has recently been the subject of a good deal
of speculation, because there is no doubt that
many perfectly sane and scientific men have
had the experience of seeing God; like
Moses, they have “seen God upon a moun-
tain.” To my mind it probably repre-
sents the coming into consciousness of
something that is going on beneath the
surface in the “Freudian unconscious,
as explained by Dr. Havelock Ellis m
his book, “The Dance of Life.’ Levine,
in his book on “The “Unconscious,
states that the contents of the “Freudian
unconscious” are “not merely thoughts in
general, but ideas of a definite dynamic
character which, in spite of their effective-
ness and intensity, do not reach conscious-
ness.” And, as Levine got Freud’s imprima-
tur for his book, I suppose we may look upon
it as official. Leaving out of consideration
for a moment the disputed question as to
whether there is any “unconscious mind” at
all, as distinct from the hormones of the
ductless glands, I think we may consider that
it is a good working hypothesis, as the ether
was in physics before Einstein showed that
he could get along perfectly Well without it.
And to my mind it is fairly certain that
religious ideas are in some way bound up
with the “thoughts” of the unconscious.
Everybody knows that there comes a time in
the lives of most young women, soon after the
onset of puberty, when they turn to religion,
and spend many hours in church which would
be better employed at tennis. Boys do not
seem to be quite so soulfully affected, for
there are few boys to be seen at church, if
they are normal boys and not dragged there
by their mothers. Thus in the gentle little
maid of Domremy, who had brooded past
health on the totally unpliysiological creed
of the Roman Catholic Church and on
the brutalities of war and invasion which
she saw all about her, it is quite pos-
sible that the power of her sex, trying
to reach the surface of her conscious-
ness, may have caused her to hear the
voice of God, to see the saints whom her
Church had taught her to look upon as the
special guardians of young girls, and to make
up her mind to save her country by a vir-
ginity that caused men to consider her as
holy in that “unvirgin” age. _ Soon after
puberty modern girls fall in love with
curates. Unknown to herself Joan had
fallen in love, but not with a pale young
curate. She had, in the purest and most
mystical of ways, fallen in love with God
and with the pleasant land of France. Thus
did her sex lead her into a greater love than
is commonly the lot of young girls—the gen-
eral love of mankind.
As Havelock Ellis points out, when one
analyses art, sqjence and religion to the
ultimate basis, they are all the same thing,
and probably they all represent the ultimate
depths of the unconscious— feelings that are
probably somehow derived from the greatest
of all primitive instincts, that of sex. I
hate the Freudian word “sublimate.” Per-
sonally I should say “refined,” because the
brain of man refuses to admit that his feel-
ings are shared with those of the beasts that
perish. And, to go still deeper into philoso-
phy, the good old stern medical agnosticism
of Huxley seems to be waning. As Pro-
fessor J. Arthur Thomson says, we were per-
fectly entitled to say “ignoramus"—we do
not know 7 . We are not entitled to say
“ignorabimus”—we shall not know —-because
there seems to be some glimmer of light in
the darkness as to the real of some
difficult things, and it is quite possible that
before very long we shall know. Ido not
mean to say that we are going back to the
silly idea that the world was made in six
days and that man’s immortal soul was con-
demned to destruction because a woman ate
an apple; but there is some real glimmer of
knowledge as to what matter and spirit really
are. The electron theory of matter, which
seems to show 7 that all matter is composed of
negative electrons and positive protons, at
least seems to cast a ray of light into the
infinite, and would appear to substantiate
Spinoza’s monism, to which he attained by
a process akin to that of sheer mysticism.
Hence we get the extraordinary growth in
the admiration for Spinoza that has so dis-
tinguished the present generation. What
the world is looking for is a new religion
which, while avoiding the constant cram-
ming down our throats of Marxian folly,
shall avoid the teaching of children those
things which are known to be untrue.

Science and the Ideal
Ever since man began to think lie has been
concerned with the secret of the origin ot
life. The occult, the laboratory, Nature liei-
self, have teen searched for it. The mystic
has solved it to his own satisfaction, and
perhaps his solution is the only possible one
so far as this world is concerned. ine
laboratory has shown protoplasm to be the
basis of life; but what is protoplasm? All
matter, science tells us, is composed of cells.
A cell is composed of atoms. An atom is
composed of ions of electricity. Is electricity
life? If so, what is electricity? Over the
door of the laboratory there still hangs a
mark of interrogation; and science, none
the less eager for material knowledge, is be-
ginning to realise that tile occult cannot be
altogether excluded from what has previously
bcen known as the real without producing
a theory of life which lacks the perfection
of truth. . , ... ,
One of the keenest interrogators of Natuie
was Charles Darwin, who, though he did not
ask her so fundamental a question as ‘What
is life?” tried to gain from her the secret
of the origin of species, which, if obtained,
was to go a long way towards solving the
great riddle that, so far as science is con-
cerned, is still a riddle. Already the theory
of evolution had been hazarded by Darwin s
illustrious grand-parent, Erasmus, by Buflon,
Lamarck and others. The great Charles
never claimed to have originated the theory,
the credit for having done so being a gift
from the hands of ignorance. He had thrown
over a medical course at the Edinburgh Uni-
versity largely because of the horror of
watching operations performed without anaes-
thetics, and was academically almost a priest
when the position of naturalist on board
the Beagle Was offered him. At Cambridge
he showed himself to be much more interested
in botany and beetles than in theology. It
Was beetles and botany which inspired him
with his first great enthusiasm —the ambi-
tion, as he put it, “to add something to the
noble structure of natural science.”
The voyage of the Beagle, the evidence
collected in the Galapagos Islands, his re-
turn to England with the ideas, of variation
and natural selection in his mind, his sub-
sequent 20 years’ endeavor to put founda-
tions under those ideas, and the bombshell
of Alfred Rus-ell Wallace’s letter from the
tropics enclosing a paper “On the Tendency
of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the
Original Type,” are all epilogues to a story,
which, if either scientist had been allowed
to have his own way, might have been called
“The Great Renunciation.” Writing to Sir
James Lyell the astounding and perturbing
news, Darwin ended his letter with the
words, “so my originality is smashed.” and
wanted to make Wallace’s paper pubi c.
Those who knew the extent of Darwm’s re-
search would not agree, and the situation
was placed before Wallace, who immediately
declared himself entirely willing to abdicate
in favor of his senior, in science. The
struggle for existence, with which they were
both so deeply concerned, became as between
themselves a struggle for self-abnegation,
ending in that famous reading before the
Linnman Society on July 1, 1858, of the
Darwin-Wallace paper. But this dirt not
entirely satisfy warm-hearted, lovable Alfred
Russell Wallace, never happier, as a con-
temporary puts it, than when making “some
plan for reforming the house, the garden,
the kitchen boiler or the universe,” who
needs must give the title “Darwinism” to Ins
book describing his discoveries in the tro-
pics. Life failed to exhaust the friendship
and generous admiration that existed be-
tween these two great-hearted men of science,
who might so easily have been bitter rivals;
and on the 50th anniversary of the reading
of that. epoch-making paper, when Darwin’s
body was lying in Westminster. Abbey, the
president of the Linnsean Society, in his
address to Wallace, said : “There is nothing
in the history of science more delightful or
more noble than the story of the relations
between yourself and Mr. Darwin.” Where-
upon the old scientist of 85 protested that
honors should be allotted between himself
and Darwin according to the time each had
spent on the problem of the origin of species
before making results public. “I, a young
man in a hurry,” he said, “spent one week.
Mr. Darwin spent 20 years.”
The path of literature is not blazed with
deeds of generosity performed by one traveller
for another, nor has the philosopher invariably
shown that philosophy which is necessary to
overcome the pettier emotions of life. But
always will the story of the Darwin-Wallace
magnanimity shine as an ideal on the path
of science. They were both concerned with
that science of life, biology, which, seems to
have the effect of opening many windows in
the souls of its devotees.
During the Great War it seemed as though
science was devoting itself entirely to
materialistic and sometimes devilish ends.
“Apes with all science in their hands” was
how Mr. Wells described certain workers in
laboratories, who were dealing with death
instead of life. But modern science, youth-
ful though it is, has served humanity with
a zeal that lifts it from the ruck of pure
materialism to the level of the ideal. Its
Darwins, Wallaces, Pasteurs, Listers,
Lodges are great high-priests who officiate
at that altar where, in the words of the
mystic, “the Ideal is the Real and the Real
is the Ideal.” In spite of the existence of
such atavistic sects as the American Funda-
mentalists, there is a great and growing
movement among present-day thinkers to-
wards fusing what is Real in the old ultra-
mystic idealism with the modern passion for
truth in material things. There are people
who regard this new Realism as the coming
religion of the world. In it the old reli-
gion. with the veil of superstition torn from
its eyes, meets science face to face, and the
Deity, whom the anthropomorphist keeps
seated on His great white throne remote
from the world, comes down among men,
so that
Earth’s crammed with heaven,
And every common bush a-fire with God.
IRENE WILKINSON.
Padding
It is a common fault of poetry that in
weaker moments it allows itself to be padded
out with adjectives, adverbs and participles.
Time and again in our reading we trip
over clumsy words and phrases, serving no
useful purpose, but rather obstructing the
picture or the thought of the poems. Such
are the hallmark of the second-rate poet.
Therefore it is with regret that we read such
a verse as this by Roderic Quinn :
Halt curtained in the mist and rain
Lay gleamless lake and still lagoon ;
Harsh crying, overhead a crane
Flapped heavily o’er ridge and dune.
It is lamentable that, it should come from
a poet who can write: —
Far splendor flashed and glimmered
On reef and shoal and bar;
That silver cornet calling
Drew beauty from afar.
More lamentable is it that the same poet
should give his name to a poem beginning: —
On the Barrier once at noontide
As I drowsed in sullen heat,
Through the still and sluggish silence
Came the sound of plodding feet—
Feet that told of whary travel,
Thirsty leagues and burdened backs,
Trudging feet of laden camels
Moving up the Western tracks.
This “burdened” effort contains no less
than 20 per cent, of adjectives—as much
as a bullock-driver’s soliloquy on his oxen.
Except in the first line an adjective can
be omitted from each one without detri-
ment to sense; indeed, with an improvement.
Rod Quinn is not the worst offender.
David McKee Wright’s best sonnets are
marred by up to 10 per cent, of padding—
unnecessary adjectives over which the
reader goes with a bump: —
Now falls the holy twilight on grey trees,
And in great love of life 1 feel the flow —
as well as two distinct and painful bumps;
and this from perhaps the finest poet in Aus-
tralia to-day. So he gives us sonnet after
sonnet: —
Surely the lost white feet' will come from far
To this grey temple with a shadowed wall
Walking the calm of faith again to share
The foolish sweetness of the dreams we are.
Allowing “grey” to stand, we still have
“lost white,” “shadowed” and “foolish” —
this last a terrible bolster of a word. Again :
I am too much in love with life to fear
The pleasant company of eager minds.
“Pleasant”! What a bump! Let me re-
write two quotations from Coleridge, who
knew so well how to charm the music out
of words. You will recognise the quota-
tions, or, if not, knock out the unnecessary
adjectives and you will have them: —
The sun’s rim dips; the pure white stars rush out,
With one stride comes the brooding dark.
Whv look’st thou so? With my yielding crossbow
I shot the splendid albatross.
With Mr. Wright this padding amounts to
a passion. He stuffs it into poem after
poem. He even has his favorites—“green”
and “grey.” I turn to one of his latest
poems, “Australians.” It is good; it is
noble and true. And with great pleasure I
read it till I come to the second-last line: —
In a great quietness grown wise.
I shudder, and (after reflecting that I get
these assaults from our two most notable
living poets) open my Shakspeare, and I
read: —
' I was with Hercules and Cadmus once
When in a wood of Crete they bay’d the boar
With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
Such gallant chiding, for, besides the groves,
The skies, the fountains, every region near
Seemed all one mutual cry. I never heard
So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
What a wealth of unqualified nouns gone to
waste!
HARRY DEAN.
A Satchel of Books
The Shadow of the Cathedral, by Vicente Ibanez
(Fisher Unwin). The Spanish novelist is more
deliberately Zolaesque here than in any of his
other works. There is no sex interest. The aim is
to create the atmosphere surrounding' the strange
ecclesiastical world which lives in and on the great
church. Pages are devoted to fierce diatribes oy
the revolutionary atheist who drifts back to Toledo
to die, and further pages to disquisitions on music
by the gentle old priest who loves Beethoven but is
wedded to classical chants. It is a tedious method,
but it brings before the reader most effectively the
profound mental stagnation of this life, which hardly
differs at all from that lived by Spaniards of the
seventeenth century under the protection of the same
Cathedral.
Recollections of Imperial Russia, by Meriel
Buchanan (Hutchinson). The reader who takes u’>
this book with the idea of getting a peep at the
last years of the late Nicholas Romanoff will be
disappointed. Miss Buchanan, who is a daughter
of the last British Ambassador in Russia before the
fall of the Czar, takes only a cursory glance at his
regime. She is more interested in plunging into the
backwash of Russian history and hauling out Peter,
Catherine, and other Russian monarchs. She has
ransacked memoirs for every little intimacy or idiocy
that will bring her characters more sharply before us.
Likewise she has the gift of unprejudiced judgment.
If her style were a little more distinguished, her
effort would be undeniably notable.
Escapade, by Evelyn Scott (Seltzer, New York).
The stark veracity of this autobiography gives it an
honorable place in modern literature. The authoress
bolted from the U.S. to Brazil with another woman’s
husband, and she sets down in crisp, illuminating
prose all the heroisms and humiliations of carrying
on a desolate amour among an inferior people.
Evidently the pair had little money, but their strong-
affection sustained them through the miseries of an
unhealthy climate in tenth-rate lodgings, in which
they were beset by almost every creeping thing.
While the book is valuable as a human document, it
is also impressive for its fugitive portraits of a
slovenly race and its delightful topographical des-
criptions.
The Child at Home, by Lady Cynthia Asquith
(Nisbet). Lady Cynthia’s world is a place of
storeyed houses with many rooms, and all who
dwell therein worship the great god Convention.
This handbook gives us much of the ritual used
bv the faithful. We are introduced to Mother,
who dwells for the greater part of her life in the
drawing- or reception-room. We have not met
Father. He is a remote figure. Like a wise man
he does not interfere with the duties of nurse —
so much seems to devolve on that paragon. How
they read, and what they read, in Utopia, how they
“go for a walk,” and when they go to the seaside,
how they may relax so far as to “eat shrimps ’ is all
faithfully detailed.
Through Formosa, by Owen Rutter (Fisher Un-
win). The writer, an authority on North Borneo,
praises what the Japanese have done in the way of
economic development, but shows that, as regards
the natives, their rule has been a failure. So
much of a failure that 100,000 savages keep them
out of 7000 square miles of country rich in camphor-
trees and soil in which rice, sugar and tea could
be grown. “Inside the electrified barbed-wire
entanglement with which they have sunrounded
these children of the forest they can only venture
with lives in their hands.” By contrast, a handful
of British in North Borneo, the inhabitants of which
are akin to the Formosans, have made the jungle
paths of that colony “as secure as the pavements of
Pall Mall ” The writer told the Japanese officials
that their ‘countrymen were welcome in North Borneo,
but notes that they go only as shopkeepers or
planters employing labor. “The Japanese coolie does
not thrive in the tropics as the Chinese coolie does.

A Definite Plan for Your Business Future
i-T-' HE Alexander Hamilton Institute offers you definite results, results
T which you will feel in a definite space of time. There is nothing vague
1 or conjectural about it. As an extra locomotive attached to a train
makes its power felt at once, so you are conscious as soon as you enrol ot a
new fresh force at work for your business progress.
You ask: ‘‘How will the Institute make its influence felt in my life, and
when?” From the following time-table you can tell exactly what proh
you will have derived from it at any given date.
THIS YEAR
3 Months from To-day
You will have a new under-
standing of economics, the
foundation upon which all busi-
ness is built. You will see more
clearly the laws governing
wages and profits —principles
that are at work all about you.
You know the relation of
money to credit and capital,
and the conditions which lead
to a general rise or fall of prices.
You will have learned the fun-
damentals of business- organi-
sation —facts without which
you could never safely go into
business for yourself.
6 Months from To-day
You will be familiar with
plant management, the basis of
modern industry. You will
know the way markets are
found for goods, and the pro-
blems affecting the manufac-
turer and the dealer. You will
have a complete picture of the
processes by which goods reach
the consumer. You will have
learned the why and how of
salesmanship and sales man-
agement, which is one of the
most universally interesting
subjects in business.
9 Months from To-day
You will know more than
the average business man about
advertising. You will have
studied office administration —
why things are done as they are
done in your office. You will be
able to talk intelligently about
accounting principles, how to
discover the trend of the busi-
ness you are in.
One Year from To-day
You will have finished the
interesting study of credit and
collections. You know the
principles on which the credit
department of your business
operates and the important fac-
tor it can be in building sales
and holding accounts. You
have studied business corres-
pondence —know how collec-
tion and business-getting letters
are built, and how to adjust
complaints so as to build good-
will for your business. You
have mastered cost-finding and
know how its principles are
applied in different lines of
business.
You have now reached the
half-way point. Already you are
beginning to see business as a
whole. Already your new know-
ledge is showing in your work.
Already you are talking with
assurance and authority to all
with whom you come in contact
—associates or superiors.
NEXT YEAR
15 Months from To-day
You have completed your
study of advertising. You
understand that all-important
subject in the modern business
world, corporation finance, and
can think along financial lines
with accuracy and decision.
The exact significance of the
limited company, the different
kinds of bonds, the mainte-
nance of capital (subjects
slightly hazy to you before) are
clear now. You have learned
about transportation and the
important part that freight
rates and schedules play in the
sale of every commodity.
18 Months from To-day
Your new insight into
foreign trade and shipping, into
banking and into international
exchange has given you a new
value to your company. You
know the mechanism of the
foreign exchange market and
how foreign shipments are
financed.
21 months from To-day.
You know about the vari-
ous kinds of insurance, how to
judge policies, how to protect
yourself. You have obtained
valuable specific advice by per-
sonal correspondence with the
Institute Staff. You know how
insurance is used to stabilise
businesses. You have informa-
tion on the stock and produce
exchanges of inestimable value
to you. You see how the prin-
ciples of accounting which you
have learned are applied to the
complicated problems of daily
business practice.
Two Years from To-day
With your study of finan-
cial and business statements —
giving you the ability as an
executive to read statements
not only on the lines but be-
tween the lines —of invest-
ments, a subject bound to influ-
ence your life closely, and the
relation of business to the Gov-
ernment, you have completed
the course.
Only two years have passed,
yet you have the equipment of
an executive. Your new sense
of power is as clear to those
about you as it is to you. That
your salary and responsibilities
should have multiplied is practi-
cally assured. You have more
confidence, more poise, more de-
cision, more time, more ability to
handle men, more assurance in
handling problems, more power.
And your progress, in position
and income, has only begun.
Can you afford not to know the facts
about a training which has done this for
200,000 successful subscribers —which can
do this for you?
The Institute asks only for the opportunity
to lay before thoughtful, ambitious men the
facts about its training—a training which has
brought to thousands of men in two years
the progress they would otherwise have
labored through in ten.
The facts are all in a book called
“Forging Ahead in Business.” It is yours
for the asking, and without the slightest
obligation. Send for your copy to-day.

The Fugitive.
A westering moon, wan-faced and large,
Shines down on swamp and timbered
height;
What weirdness holds the world in charge i
What alien presence chills the night?
The w’atcliing trees scarce draw their breath,
So hushed, so held by fear are they!
Can it be something w'orse than death
That through the moonlight rides this
Way ?
Though there be neither sound nor stir
In leaf and blade, or bird and w'ind,
Who is it speeds with wdiip and spur?
And w'ho is it that rides behind?
Headlong adow'n the timbered track.
Their eyes ablaze, their heads bent low',
Through pallid shine and shadow' black
The hunted and the hunter go.
In caverns, carved by w'ind and rain,
Far echoes w’aken to their din;
How' like are they, these riders tw’ain —
More like were never kith and kin!
Through hour and hour goes on the hunt
O’er grass-grown flat and rough rock shelf.
Who rides behind? Who rides in front?
A horseman flying from himself!

Bush Magic.
The bush has neither tale of Troy to tell,
Nor saga lay to sing;
But ever there recurs this miracle,
A forest blossoming.
Through secret tangled scrub great gums
delight
To toss their heads and throw
Into the air their honey-scented white
Blossoms of summer snow;
While, light and frail above, a few' clouds
gleam,
As rising mist enshrouds
Deep gullies and the pale blue hills that
seem
More fragile than the clouds.
In glimmering forest depths the creek runs
by,
Through jungle, fern and vine,
Primeval bush —only wild earth and sky ;
Of man there is no sign.
In other lands he writes his history,
His tale of change and strife;
But here broods nature’s ancient mystery,
Older than human life.
There is a charm in any storied spot
That man has made his owm ;
But stranger beauty dw'ells where man is
not,
With magic spell unknown.
The bush remains, aloof from human fate,
Creek, gully, rock and tree,
Enchanted with her beauty desolate,
Her brooding mystery.

The Inn.
When the spider Dusk has spun
Purple webs across the suu,
And day’s yellow; lantern dies
In the haunted lilac skies,
Gabled houses, eltiu quaint,
Lit with moon-fire w r an and faint,
All night’s happy secrets keep,
In the star-white town of sleep.
Back and forth, and to and fro,
Panther-footed shadows go,
There where fiagoned Lethe gleams,
Magic from the inn of dreams.
There where all our longings turn,
Where at last our hearts discern
In that pansy-purple wine
Grief's eternal anodyne.
Heart o’ me, shall we, too, come,
Now the lips of day are dumb.
Robbed of morning’s color song,
By the pathways strange and long
Where the stars are hollow' spheres
Dripping jewel-blazing tears
Down from skies without a sun,
There where love and dreams are one?
Ah, vou smile, elusive still!
Twilight's moss-rose petals spill,
Opalescent, pearl by pearl,
All their sweetness round you, girl!
Here we may hot love, alas!
Here the lost w inds pause and pass,
Crooning songs to blade and leaf,
Sad and frail as goblin grief.
Sorrow-deep and woman-wise,
Yours are fabled Helen’s eyes
That must ever madden all
Hearts on whom their flame shall fall,
Exquisite and dear desire
Sings to me with mouth of lire;
Yet, day long, I know for me
Nevermore your lips shall be.
Come! In shadow-haunted skies
Ev’ning’s yellow' lantern dies;
Spiders of the dark have spun
Lilac webs across the sun.
Ever tolled ip drowsy rhyme,
Poppy bells of quiet chime ;
While in valleys green and deep
Waits the star-white town of sleep.
I,ate, ah late, dear heart o’ me,
Shall our journey’s ending be!
All the fret of every day
There shall cease and fall away.
Lotus cups with Lethe gleams
Fill that magic inn of dreams.
Where alone your lips I press,
Dear my lady Happiness!
QUEENSLAND.

J. BULL’S TROUBLES—AND OURS,
WHICH ARE MORE IMPORTANT.
Tiie new Ramshackle Ministry in Britain
slides downhill so fast that it is no easy
business to keep pace with it. It seems to
be made of the wrong materials, includ-
ing theorists, apostles, visionaries, talking-
machines, trade-union secretaries who got a
smattering of business knowledge while mak-
ing out union tickets, crusaders and a few
embittered liers-in-wait who believe that
there will be a new and better world if every
wagepayer, or person who looks liable to
become one, is intercepted and destroyed.
The matters on which the Ministry was sup-
posed to be most solid are those on which
it has defaulted most definitely. The levy
on capital, which was to pay off tons of
debt and save cwts. of interest, has ceased
from troubling. And instead of replac-
ing the demoralising system of doles with
remunerative employment, there has been an
abject failure to find any employment at all.
It is now proposed not only to enlarge the
pauper allowances, but to extend them to
boys and girls of 14. Hitherto these have
ranked as the children of unemployed parents,
and a small addition has been made to the
familv pension on their account. Now,
they having left school and being qualified
for the battle of life, they are apparently
to rank as independent unemployed, and to
set up in that capacity for themselves, each
with his or her separate and recognised job
of being out of work. It isn’t much of a
way to begin life, but it is at least a begin-
ning—an entrance into the seemingly per-
manent profession of waiting on events.
Perhaps things would go better if the Cabi-
net contained fewer apostles and more manu-
facturers, and if it swapped some of its best
visionaries for bankrupt traders who had
had a chance to recognise the road which
leads to 2|d. in the f. But if British Labor-
in-Office has lost the run of one or two mat-
ters which belonged particularly to its pro-
gramme, it has developed, either perma-
nently or pending reconsideration, a most
remarkable craze for Freetrade —an affair
which was rather regarded as Asquith’s
perquisite—and some remarkable results may
follow, here as well as in England.
* * * *
. A few years ago Lloyd George strained
bis Cobdenism to the extent that a Safe-
guarding of Industries Act was passed. It
provided that when foreign goods, other than
food and drink, were being offered to British
traders at less than the lowest possible cost
of local production, the Board of Trade
might put as much as 33 per cent, duty on
them. This was intended to meet the case
of countries with protected local markets,
cheap labor and cheap paper currencies,
which were making progress towards the ex-
tinction of essential British industi'ies. It
proved wholly insufficient; but this insuffici-
ency being recognised, if the old crowd had re-
mained in office it might have strained its
Cobdenism a trifle further. Lloyd George,
pacifist and hard fighter, fleet-scrapper and
lieet-builder, anti-Turk and pro-Turk, has
always had a gift for shifting his point of
view—he would be the ideal furniture-
remover. But now the Board of Trade is
controlled by Sidney Webb, a professorial
gentleman of apostolic aspect, who only
comes down to earth once in a while to get
his boots repaired. And lie has announced
that the most essential feature of the Safe-
guarding of Industries law will be allowed
to lapse next August if not repealed earlier,
the whole measure being contrary to the pure
spirit of Cobden, which priceless ghost must
not be disturbed even though the heavens fall.
* * * *
. Inevitably, the importation of foreign goods
into the United Kingdom will increase con-
siderably under this new instalment of
Freetrade, unless the Safeguarding of Indus-
tries law has been a complete misfire. And
with that increase of imports unemploy-
ment and poverty will grow, provided there
is any room left for growth. On the other
hand Britain may get a little extra work at
finishing new heaps of Hun and other alien
goods, and putting a British label on them,
and shipping them here for the destruction
of Australian industries, many of which are
already drooping—iron and woollens especi-
ally. If one-quarter of the bare manufac-
tured value of imported goods represents
work done inside the United Kingdom, though
not necessarily in a British-owned factory,
the preference clauses in our tariff applv. At
recent advices 90 per cent, of the goods
which reach Australia from Britain are pre-
ferential, and the preference amounts to 12J
per cent, of their value. So it is no small
concession. Australia sacrifices, in fact,
about £9,000,000 of revenue a year under this
heading, and loses a dreadful amount of em-
ployment and wages which would come in
very handy. In this connection three things
become obvious:—
The Commonwealth is importing far more than
it can pay for, and in the process it is retarding
its own industries and piling up immeasurable debts
for posterity. In the eight months to February,
1924, imports were £15,000,000 in excess of exports.
Exports should have exceeded imports by about
£17,500,000 in order that outgoing goods might pay
for incoming goods and also meet the interest on
foreign debts.
Less and less of the amount Australia sacrifices to
help British manufacturers goes to British manufac-
turers. The closure of British factories is evidence
of that. In the eight months to February, 1924,
the United Kingdom took from the Sydney and
Brisbane sales 181,000 bales of wool as compared
with 350,000 for the corresponding period a year
earlier, while France took the U.K.’s place as prin-
cipal buyer.
When the apostolic-looking gentleman at the
British Board of Trade and his cranky colleagues of
the Ramshackle Ministry remove some more barriers,
and make England a mere station on the way from
the continent of Europe to Australia, we are likely
to have more imports than we have, and more
alien imports, and more debts, in addition to less
work.
Wherefore it is again moved that one of the
earliest jo.bs when Parliament resumes should
be the abolition of the British preference, the
same to remain abolished until there is a
different kind of Britain to negotiate with
than the one which so ostentatiously dis-
solved partnership over the Singapore naval
base. And a general overhaul of the Tariff
wouldn’t be a bad idea to follow with. Any
Tariff is liable to become mouldy with suffi-
cient neglect.
SOCIALISM UNLIMITED.
State Socialism was given a useful tactical
advantage in Australia 17 years ago by the
idiotic measures taken to combat it. The
so-called Liberals of the period strove to
serve the cause of Freetrade and anti-
defence by depicting their Labor oppo-
nents as loose-living atheists. Phrases were
coined about the bursting of the marriage-
tic and the overthrow of religion and applied
to ponderously respectable characters like
Andrew Fisher and J. C. Watson. Natu-
rally the constituencies refused to swallow
such nonsense. Reidism fell never to rise
again in its old foreign-trade and States-
Rights form, and Socialism became, if not
fashionable, at any rate a problem to be
examined in no furiously hostile spirit. It
took the World War to demonstrate widely
what is really wrong with State Socialism
from the point of view of the State; to push
homo the vital point that the ancestors of
the Nationalism of to-day had missed. And
because nothing in this world is wholly
good or wholly bad, it likewise took the war
to demonstrate that tjjere are occasions
when nothing but State Socialism can save
a nation from destruction. The country
that wishes to be saved financially will
strike a mean between the two policies—be-
tween repudiation of Socialism in any cir-
cumstances whatever, and the adoption of
large instalments of it as a matter of course.
The war had not raged six months before
thousands who had been hostile to Social-
ism were unconscious converts to it. The
departments were growing up. Attachment
to a department satisfies the same urgent
craving in one type of individual as church
membership does in another. It produces
feelings of security and restfulness, a sense
of respectability and self-importance. A
job in a well-established department should
he, with ordinary luck and good manage-
ment, as safe as the State itself. There
is little or none of the nagging insistence
on punctuality and efficiency which harasses
employees of a leisurely habit in private-
enterprise businesses. All are friends to-
gether. If it were the custom to place an
appropriate motto over departmental doors
the inscription would not be “Abandon
Hope,” etc., but the gentler “Live and Let
Live.”. The history of the Censor’s Depart-
ment is an example out of the thousands
available of what happens when Socialism
Unlimited is accepted as a policy. At no
time during the war was there the slightest
need of a Censor’s Department in Australia.
The enemy did not require the local press
to tell him of the defence measures we were
taking, any more than he needed the London
papers, later on, to inform him of what
A.I.F. battalions were in the line in Flan-
ders. And, in any event, the papers could
have been relied upon for reticence. Never-
theless, expensive organisations were built
up in all the capitals; young men assumed
military titles, and uniforms and rushed to
“do their bit” by blue-pencilling passages
that could not, by any stretch of the imagi-
nation, have influenced the course of the
war, and the taxpayers are still paying the
bill. No one will ever know what propor-
tion of. the £750,000,000 which represents
Australia’s share of the war debt was wasted
on fooleries of this description, but if a
guess were made that for every £1 legiti-
mately spent 20s. was thrown away the esti-
mate would probably not be far wide of the
mark. And there was recklessness elsewhere
than in the trenches. Treasurer Cooks, of
N. S. Wales, recently made an estimate of
“the money absolutely wasted in different
Government enterprises—most of it loan
money.” The total for the Commonwealth
and four States (Queensland, N. S- Wales,
Westralia and Tasmania) came to
£7,661,988. The Federation lost £2,645,761
in one hand on shipping. N. S. Wales was
£772,711 to the bad; Queensland, £823,665.
And of course the figures are an absurd
under-estimate. Without any effort The
Bulletin could show that State activities
in Australia have cost 10 times seven millions-
odd. Yet in face of this, and of the bitter
experience garnered all over the world in
the past 10 years, the A.L.P. proposes “More
State Socialism than ever!” as a suitable
slogan for Labor at future elections, Federal
and State: —
The party must aim at the establishment of State
cement works, a State housing scheme, State cold
stores, State insurance and workmen’s compensation,
nationalised mining, full trade-union and arbitration
rights to public servants, salary re-adjustments to be
automatically operative; State loan office; re-enact-
ment of the Fair Rents Bill, “with drastic penalties
for rack-renters,” etc., and a 44-hour week all round.
* * * *
Anyone who registers a protest against
lunacy of this sort is liable to earn the
angry sneer that G. B. Shaw directed re-
cently at the anti-Socialism of Winston
Churchill. Because bunkum was talked
about Socialism over a decade ago, its
votaries hold to the tradition that typical
opponents of the creed resemble “extremely
decayed gentlewomen in remote villages in pre-
historically backward districts.” Polemically
this may be effective, especially amongst
those who are too young to have had per-
sonal experience of the later history of
State Socialism ; but in fact it has nothing
to do with the case. Equally beside the
point was Shaw’s R.N. argument:—
Mr. Churchill had the job of bringing the
British fleet up to the scratch during the war, and
he now implies that it would have been done better
by the Thames Steamboat Company.
No one since those early British Freetraders
who were so individualistic that they
disapproved of communistic drainage
systems has been a thoroughly con-
sistent anti-Socialist. Indeed, it is dif-
ficult to be anything without qualifi-
cation in this world of makeshifts and com-
promises. Normal people of all creeds,
classes and political beliefs are Socialists to
the extent that they approve of nationalised
armies and navies. State police are recog-
nised as necessary for the maintenance of
true liberty, and private-enterprise police-
men, after the U.S. model, as enemies of
liberty. And similarly with health, sani-
tation and other activities which stand out
as obviously the concern of an embattled
State. The mistake lies in assuming that,
because State Socialism is essential in one
place, it is justifiable in another; and it is
a transparently dishonest argument that
because a nation has to support thousands of
naval, military, medical and other experts, it
should also go in for hiring citizens to attend
to purely sectional enterprises like fish-
catching and brick-making. If Australia is
to struggle back to solvency one of its first
moves will have to be not merely to repudi-
ate the idea of starting fresh State busi-
nesses, but to set about getting rid of
the scores of superfluous departments it
already possesses. There are many adven-
tures in Socialism to which we are irrevo-
cably committed, and from the costly impli-
cations of which we cannot shrink. An
increasing annual bill for naval defence
appears inevitable. Education is one of
those things that go back if they do not
go forward, and the same applies to measures
for the preservation and improvement of the
nations health. What the A.L.P. proposes
to- do is to pile on to these inescapable com-
mitments scores of others that have no hope
of paying dividends, that are bound to grow
and grow under the fertilisation of political
influence, and that will eventually be as
expensive to the nation as another war.
There are no anti-Socialists of the comic
Reidite variety in Australia to-day. It is
doubtful if there ever were. But when it
comes to instituting ruinously expensive
rest-houses for languid toilers at a time
when we are unable to pay our just debts,
then the whole nation is likely to disclose
itself as anti Socialist on the good and suf-
ficient ground that it cannot afford to be
anything else.
THE FASTIDIOUS FILIPINO.
"I would rather be ruled like Hell by Filipino*
than like Heaven by Americans.” — Don Manuel
Quezon, President of 'the Senate in the Philippine
Islands.
Brown Brother of the Philippines takes
some understanding, Ilis mind, as well as
his skin, is brown. I mean no offence.
White thinking is not brown thinking. Out-
side of his politics our Juan de la Cruz
is likeable enough. lie is sociable, hos-
pitable, industrious, courteous and often
lowly of mind. But along with all that is
his brown thinking. We must get that
fact at the outset. Otherwise little
headway is possible. To illustrate.
Masonry has acquired of late a re-
markable vogue in the Philippines. But
its 100-peso initiation fee is too much for
many who would like to enter. And every
oficiale in the country, regarding it as a
means of personal advancement, wants to
join. Into this situation has come a new
indigenous order —Legionarios de Trabajos
(Legioners of Work) with a small initia-
tion fee and various “benefits.” In a sur-
prisingly brief period the Legionarios boast
of more than 100,000 members. But the
new organisation has appropriated the
Masonic insignia and vernacular —titles,
apron, square and compass. Anger and
amazement prevail within the craft. It
availeth not. Where else on earth could
be found so frank a steal and so outright a
lack of originality? The Legionarios are
innocent. It is beyond their brown think-
ing to perceive error of any sort in their
naive procedure.
Mr. Quezon again. He is President of
the Senate and the political Top Note. A
few months ago he sent a cablegram to
Pancho Villa in the United States. The
Speaker of the House of Representatives,
Roxas, also put his name to the message.
This Pancho is probably the most popular
Filipino these days. He is a world cham-
pion—-lightweight champion. Mr. Quezon,
President of the Senate, sent Pancho the
said cablegram on the eve of the champion-
ship battle. He assured the pugilist that
the don in the chair at the Senate was pray-
ing for his success against the white man.
Possibly the outcome of the fight was an-
other notable example of answered prayer!
Be that as it may, not one brown mind dis-
cerned the least incongruity in the proceeding.
There is one subject concerning which all
Filipinos think alike, in definite, straight-
out Anglo-Saxon style. This is independence.
Everything will come right with independ-
ence. In the face of such remarks as that
of Mr. Quezon, what use is it to speak of
difficulties or to point out rather obvious
perils? Money? Why stop for a trifle like
that? Counting every crag in the archi-
pelago, there are 3000 islands calling for
naval protection. Luzon, the most impor-
tant, is roughly 500 miles north and south.
Manila is 350 miles south of Cape Bojeador,
on the north-w’est corner of this great island.
Bojeador is nearer Formosa than Manila.
And Formosa is Japanese! But, then, as
Mr. Quezon will gladly assure you, Japan
is kind-hearted, and would never dream of
confiscating this’ “Pearl of the Orient” from
the Filipinos! It seems pertinent to point
out that there is in existence at present not
one Filipino man-of-war of any description;
and seeing that the entire revenue for a
year would be needed to call into being a
modern battleship, it is hard to make out
where the vessel is coming from. And what
is a small island republic without a navy
but a bird to be plucked?
The national poverty in itself is not the
whole story either. Your Filipino is not
a financial genius. Governor-General Woon
says that the women are the best men in the
country—and he is right. The women do
at times have some financial sense, the men
never. The man so endowed is far more
Spanish or perhaps Chinese than Filipino.
The Escolta is Manila’s leading business
street. Its rich stores and banks from end
to end are controlled by East Indians, Ameri-
cans, Spaniards and British. Filipinos are
behind some of the counters, but never in
the manager's sanctum. They have certain
unfortunate habits with cash responsibili-
ties. Here again this strange brown think-
ing re-appears. It is on record that one of
their endless societies was being organised
in a Manila high school. In this particular
society was a teacher-adviser. Leading up
to the election of a treasurer she offered this
wise counsel: “You had better choose a rich
girl for your treasurer, so that when she
takes the money she will be able to pay it
back again!” Some things have to be taken
for granted.
Uncle Sam decided that the first thing his
protege needed to be independent with was
his cash. If he could manage that he might
tackle the remainder. The initial experi-
ment was disastrous. But the average Fili-
pino does not know it. He does not know
about the depreciation of his money. Has
he not better homes? And has he not bought
a motor-car? And look at his schools! The
excellent roads are lined with schools. Each
province has its high school. Sometimes
there is more than one, and also a farm-
school. Trouserless boys arc well provided
for in the mountain country. Every class-
room is crowded. One result is a host, of
youths educated above their economic en-
vironment. There are elements of tragedy
in this fact.
These youths and the politicos arc the
clamorers for independence. They want
their independence, “immediate, unqualified
and absolute.” Each year, automaticallv,
1,000,000 pesos (£100,000) is set aside out
of taxes for independence propaganda. It
provides banquets for influential visitors
from the United States. It pays journalists
in the United States to speak out for the
sacred cause. It provides the expenses and
huge allowances of politicos and patriots on
numerous independence commissions to
Washington.
The Filipino has even now all the inde-
pendence he can handle. He is as free as
any man in the United States. He has the
priceless protection of the United States in
a world where such glowing ideas as that
of the League Of Nations has been Mtjsso-
LiNi-ised out of recognition! Small nations
are at the mercy of others, and these Fili-
pinos comprise a small nation. It cannot
be questioned that the United States has
done a wonderful work here. The very
physique of the people has been built up.


But the big republic lacks some important
British elements. The last Governor, Har-
rtson, granted unlimited Filipinisation. The
National Bank debacle was only one of the
results. The present Governor-General is
Leonard Wood, a strong man. He has
labored splendidly, but at variance with
Harrison’s programme. Naturally, his
policy did not please the over-indulged
Quezons. The entire outfit'of departmental
secretaries, making a stalking horse of an
action by which the Governor-General sought
to correct some of their own apparent devi-
ousness, stalked indignantly out of office.
Forthwith they set up a demand for a rubber-
stamp type of Governor, after the fashion,
as they put it, of British colonial Governors.
Wood is not the sort of man to be a rubber-
stamp. At the same time, as compared with
the British system, the American custom
of a change of policy in colonial administra
tion w'ith a change of Government in the
United States is an element of weakness
and a potent source of discontent. There is
a lack of the stability, the singleness of pur-
pose, and withal the resiliency that inhere
in the British plan. Washington must settle
on a definite, permanent policy and adhere
to it. Then it may be expected that various
disturbing factors will be eliminated and
life here rendered easier on the nerves.
One of the problems which independence
is expected to bring is the choice of a suit-
able name for the new republic. It will
be recalled that the Senate President is
named Quezon. The first syllable of Quezon
is pronounced like the second syllable of
the English word “decay.” Quezon’s chief
rival has been Senor Osmena, the first syl-
lable of whose name contains a short o.
Some bright mind has intimated that the
needed name might be derived from a com-
bination of these two first syllables—Que-Os.
I am not sure that the suggestion will be
received cordially by those most concerned.
But this much is certain —a more appropriate
name for what will happen, if independence
comes, is not possible.
MANILA.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Accidental Governments.
All the parties have something to learn
from the elections in the western and central
States. A right interpretation of the results
is especially needed in the Labor party, where
the cry has been raised that “Labor is com-
ing back everywhere,” and the impression
is apparently reviving that Australia will
submit to anything from Labor Governments
so long as they stick to their label.
In truth there has been no substan-
tial addition to the Labor vote in
either South Aus. or Westralia. Labor
won in both States, not because it was Labor,
but because it was the Opposition. Requir-
ing in each case a gain of eight seats merely,
and pitted in each case against a , dull old
gang which had been in office for seven years,
had made a mess of the finances, had quar-
relled with the Country party and had been
too lazy or stupid to alter electoral arrange-
ments highly advantageous to its opponents,
the A.L.P. got in, as any Opposition would
have done in like circumstances; but its
majorities were surprisingly small. The
position in South Aus. has been summarised
by a Ministerial organ in the following
mournful sentences
Beyond all doubt the Liberals were prejudiced by
the feeling aroused by the Premier’s declaration two
sessions ago that “wages must come down,” his
advocacy of black labor for the Northern Territory,
his unfortunate attack on the wages boards, the
granting of railway contracts to America, the failure
to bring about electoral reform, the opposition of the
Public Service vote, and the antagonism provoked by
Mr. Harwell's utterances among temperance workers.
....Labor traded largely on the Premier’s declarations
in favor of unpopular causes, such as his unhappy
assault upon the White Australia principle, and his
party has suffered seriously from the efforts to
identify it with individual opinions and tactical
mistakes for which it was not responsible.
With the handicap of such a leader the
Liberals could not reasonably hope to get
back. And yet there would be no Labor
Government in South Aus. if Harwell had
had sense enough to bring in preferential
voting. Gunn owes five of his 26 seats to
vote-splitting on the other side. Four of
Collier’s 26 in Westralia were similarly
handed to him by the egregious Coalition
Government when it acquiesced in the defeat
of its Redistribution of Seats Bill. Neither
Gunn nor Collier would be in office but
for the fatlieadedness of Barwell and Mit-
chell. It will, therefore, be unsafe for either
to imagine that he has received a popular man-
date to squander loan funds on white ele-
phants by way of ushering in the socialist
millennium. For Lib.-Nationalists the
lesson of the elections is that the public is
not to be scared into voting for their impos-
sible Barwells and Mitchells by hysteri-
cal remarks about the Red objective and
“the necessity of united action against the
common enemy.” And the Cockies have
been told very plainly that their factional
disturbances and their questionable attitude
on the fiscal issue, which they have an un-
fortunate habit of dragging into State con-
tests, arouse no enthusiasm among country
voters.

Labor and Defence.
Federal Labor-leader Charlton, uplifted on
his two feet and in his soul at a dinner given
to the visiting British naval officers, spoke
brave words which will require big deeds to
back , them. “If England is in dan-
ger,” said Matthew, “it will be found that
Australia will provide not only for her own
defence but for the defence of the Empire.”
That being so, the Labor leader will doubt-
less see to it that Australia gets to work at
once. For there is much work to be done, and
much of it is the kind of work which has to be
started years in advance, when there isn’t
a cloud on the horizon, and started regard-
less of whether the act may he construed
as showing a mean suspicion of the good faith
of somebody, or anybody, or even everybody.
A certain amount of satisfaction was ex-
pressed during the Great War when it was
proved that a very creditable soldier could
be manufactured in six months. But that was
nothing to be absolutely, enthusiastic about.
The arsenals, the naval bases, the military
staff, the host of'expert makers of munitions
and the little regular army weren’t the work
Of six months; and the navy, which did more
than anything else to secure the valuable
half-years breathing time, was no rushed 01
scamped job either. When Australia sets
to taking stock of what it really does m the
way of paying for defence, it is always
pleased to find that it shapes well enough in
proportion to population when compared
with, sav, Canada and South Africa. l>ut
Canada knows that no defence it could put
up would be likely to avail against the United
States, while the United States, with its
rooted objection to new intruders in America,
is itself Canada’s sure, defence against every-
body except itself. As for South Africa, its
strong point is that it is on one of the main
roads to India, and that the Cold Country
would hardly allow a powerful rival to camp
on that road. Then neither Canada nor the
South African Union is an island and liable
to complete blockade and to sea attack on
all sides. Neither has all its towns that
count for anything planted on the shore, so
that they are here to-day and yet liable, by
reason of one of these surprise attacks with
which ancient and modern history teems, to
be gone to-morrow —more liable, by reason
of the new weapons of war, than any cities
ever were before. Nor has S’Africa or
Canada any great stretch of coast which any
enemy can reach by sea, but wdiich the coun-
try’s defenders can’t reach by land for lack
of railways. Nobody can argue w'ith the
slightest semblance of reason that two-thirds
of their territory is lawfully forfeited
because no serious effort is made at settle-
ment. No heavily-loaded Great Power sits
on the doorstep of either with a plausible
grievance, or a grievance which could become
plausible at anv suitable moment. Neither
ever got badly into the habit of running its
railways along the shore for the conveni-
ence of the first landing party. And Britain
hasn’t abandoned them to their own devices,
but for sufficient reasons of its own it pre-
serves a naval base of sorts both in Africa
and in America. In fact, the position of Aus-
tralia is unique for combined bulk and help-
lessness —far worse than that of Maoriland,
which is better occupied, better served by its
railways, and further from any visible point
of danger. When questions of defence are
under consideration the example of the other
Dominions is of no importance. The only
comparison worth making is that between
Britain, which lays out about sns. per head
per annum on providing for the public safety,
and the Commonwealth, which spends about
12s. The mere size of the military and naval
budget, of course, isn’t everything, for it is
possible to have the kind of Government
which produces illimitable budget, and infini-
tesimal results. But an Australian defence
expenditure that was a trifle larger per head
(perhaps a considerable trifle larger) than
Britain’s would be easily justifiable consid-
ering that the area to be defended per head
is so enormous, and that Australia’s stra-
tegic railways are mostly still to be built.
Port Stephens and Capital Ships.
Vice-Admiral Field, in one of his last
speeches on the naval situation, did the useful
service of extinguishing the claims of Port
Stephens as a base. He was obviously puzzled
as to why they had ever been advocated: —
You could maintain a second-cruiser squadron
in Australia at less cost than it would take to make
Port Stephens a good base. Your base should be
at Port Darwin.
He went on to dispel the alluring notion
that the Commonwealth is capable of being
defended by submarines and aircraft, while
recognising their pricelessness in their own
place:—•
An enemy can defeat your submarines by means
of destroyers. You are compelled to build larger
craft to keep off the destroyers, and so, ultimately,
you get the capital ship—not, perhaps, the capital
ship of to-day, but some type that is the most
powerful thing afloat. ,
Aircraft are not going to replace cruisers. Lv
all means have them reconnoitring; have them
in use with your light cruisers, but do not imagine
that, aeroplanes are going to defend your trade routes.
The radius of action of aircraft carrying bombs is only
about 200 miles and back.
What he did not know was that Australia
has now, as always, a number of conflicting
xi aval-defence schools whose members
opinions are guided by considerations which
have little or no relation to the safety of
the country. The supporters of the Port Ste-
phens base" idea live mostly in Sydney or New-
castle. They are not interested in its stra-
tegical disabilities or in the engineering diffi-
culties it presents. All they know is that
it lies at their back doors, and represents
the next-best thing to the forlorn hope ot
inducing the nation to build a base at Sydney
or Newcastle, as the case may be. Their
opinion of Port Stephens as a place to be
developed on its merits may be seen by
anyone who calls there: though_intended by
nature to serve the richest hinterland in
the State, it is in much the same condition
industrially as when the first white man saw
it. The submarine-aeroplane school, like
those in favor of an unspecified cash contri-
bution to the R.N., are the cunning ones who
hold by cheap defence. The,thing is.a con-
tradiction in terms. The capital ship is plainly
the only weapon of ultimate defence for a
country which lives largely by credit, and
can only maintain its credit, by exporting
sea-borne goods. If Australians were primi-
tive farmers capable of supporting themselves
on the soil, they might view with equanimity
the prospect of being cut off from all com-
munication with the outside world for months
at a time. As things are, such an experi-
ence would lead to starvation and anarchy.
That is why the danger-point lies some 4000
miles from F'ort Stephens. Until a base—
not merely a fueling base, but one at wlueli
capital ships can put in for repairs—is estab-
lished on the flank of our trade routes, in
the neighborhood of the only point where
they can possibly be cut, we shall remain in
a precarious position.
Japan, the U.S.A., and Us.
The possibility —to use the mildest term —of
serious trouble between Japan and the
U.S.A. as an outcome of the Republic’s
Japanese exclusion law raises some interest-
ing questions. The Japanese, as the aggrieved
parties, would presumably take the initiative
and seize the Philippines—a bare thousand
miles from Japan and five times that dis-
tance from the Pacific slope. Japan might
then sit down and wait for America to carry
the battle to her. If America hesitated,
Hawaii and the rest of her possessions in the
North Pacific would go; so it. may be taken
for granted that there would be engagements
—when and where it suited the Japanese,
w'hose fleet for speed and gun-power is pro-
bably equal to anything America can put
this side of Panama. Japan has an advan-
tage as regards personnel. Her people are
seafarers and are subject to naval ds well
as military conscription. The Americans
have never taken very kindly to the blue
water, and the navy has never been so short-
handed as it is to-day. With the Philippines
in her hands, Japan’s trade routes (through
the China Sea to the Indian Ocean and then
west or east) would be free: on the other
hand, the whole of America’s trade in the
North Pacific would be liable to interception
from Bonin and the rest of the Japanese
bases. Even though the Americans won
great naval battles, they could not invade
Japan and might not recover the Philip-
pines ; and even though the Japanese de-
feated the U.S. as decisively as they did the
[Russians 18 years ago (an unimaginable con-
tingency), they could not occupy a foot of
American soil. The burnt-offering placed
on the altar of the ensuing stalemate might
be Australia. The Japanese might be pleased
to forego their claims on California for the
privilege of coming here; and a war-chast-
ened America might be expected to tell us
that it w r as not the business of Americans
to uphold the White Australia doctrine. As
for Britain, with no dock capable of taking
leviathans such as the Colorado and Matsu,
which would decide a Pacific war, her only
help could lie in the form of diplomatic
representations; and, as the Japanese ambas-
sador at Washington found last week, re-
proaches and protests are futile when a
nation knows what it wants and is deter-
mined to have it.
“Bankers in London.”
There has been a remarkable revival in the
older and duller type of Freetrade literature
since the Country Party began to assert
itself as a selfish combination which would
sell Australia, body and soul, if it could
thereby get its plough and harrow in free of
duty. Items like this, from the S. M.
Herald’s money column (15/4/’24), have
quite a flavor of the ancient Parkes and
Pumpkin Smith days :
Bankers in London, the cable states, believe that
the reason for paying £lO3 in London to send £IOO
to Australia- —ail extraordinary price considering
that Australia is a debtor country—is due to
heavy Government borrowing and the want of resili-
ency in the currency. They might also have added
that the tariff has an effect. Exports must be
paid for by imports. But the tariff provides many
hindrances to imports.
It is a pathetically silly line of assertion;
but, then, no Foreign-trader, w 7 hen he climbs,
on the back of his hobby and_ the _ animal
bolts with him. is quite right in his head.
A few points which might be considered are
these:■ —
The Herald's logic is that we ought to import
more (and presumably make less, so that there
may be room for more imports), and that the way
to do this is ,to lower or abolish the tariff, because
“the tariff provides many hindrances to imports.”
In 1922-23 the Commonwealth imported £13,901,898
worth more than it exported. In the eight months
of 1923-24 for which figures are available it im-
ported £15,169,076 worth more than it exported.
So in 20 months it bought more than it paid for to
the extent of over £29,000,000, and made no pro-
vision for a much bigger amount than that which
it owed in interest. A paper which desires to re-
move “hindrances” so that Australia may import
more than that, and go into debt fui-ther than that,
is pretty mad.
It is admitted that “bankers in London” ascribe
the troubled state of the exchange to heavy Austra-
lian borrowing over there, and to the lack of sufficient
currency over here. Being bankers, and located at
the seat of the trouble, which is also a seat of finance,
the Herald might modestly give them credit for
knowing things. Also even the Herald hasn’t the
gall to profess that “bankers in London” charge any
part of the trouble to the Australian tariff and insuf-
ficient importation. Again, the aged organ might
allow them to be acquainted with things. To turn an
expert’s warning not to borrow so much into a
warning to buy more, even if we can’t pay for it,
is merely wicked.
It is unlikely that all the importing cranks
in Australia will get the tariff reduced,
though they may do something to prevent the
increase which, on the importation figures,
is badly needed. But they may achieve
things by lending encouragement to a party
whieh is, apparently, ready to do anything
provided it secures an imported harrow in-
stead of an Australian one, and seems to be
even ready to put Labor in power by way
of recording its protest if it doesn’t secure a
duty-free harrow. If Labor gets into
Federal power there is no hope of Freetrade
here; but there may be something to make
up for a loss of Customs revenue. The
“levy on capital” is beginning to loom
brightly on the local programme. In fact,
if demented Freetrade helps Labor by a cir-
cuitous path into office, it may even levy,
on the 50 per cent, scale, upon rich Free-
trade papers.
. .—4 ——--
A Bogus Industry.
Labor politicians who complain that there
is unemployment in the land, and that the
outlook for their workless constituents
grows blacker instead of brighter, should be
interested in statements made recently by
representatives of what is alleged to be an
industry, and a great one at that. The
occasion was a picture-showmen’s banquet
in Sydney, and one of the speakers held
forth as follows:
The cinema was now a great business. A few
years ago It was not even regarded seriously as an
industry. Certainly, a few years ago a whole pro-
gramme was secured for £2 10s., and now £2OO
was not an extraordinary nrice for a big item. “But,”
the speaker said, “1 don't care if it is £4OO, so
long as it will show 20, 40, or 50 per cent, profit,.”
And, he added, the industry had a still greater
future.
Patrons of the movies will be gratified to
learn that they are expected to supply a
showman’s profit of from 20 to 50 p.c*.
Citizens who find their taxes burdensome
will likewise be charmed with the informa-
tion that it is nothing out of the way
for one showman (there are about 800 in
Australia) to pay £2OO for the hire of one
film —imported, of course —the Customs
duty on which is never more than £SO and
may be as little as £25. Their delight will
increase when they understand that the
foreign owners of a film dutiable in Aus-
tralia at £3O or thereabouts, and hired out
for something like £4OOO altogether, may
evade income-tax by fixing its value at
£IO,OOO, or any fantastic sum that occurs
to them, although the Australian earnings of
pictures which have already had the run of
the U.S.A. market, and copies of which,
ready for exhibition, can be struck off in
that country for a few pounds apiece, are
nearly all profit. But persons who get their
living by hanging round film exchanges and
theatres are not entitled to boast that they
are engaged in a great Australian industry.
Australia ought to be manufacturing motor
chassis, as Canada has been doing for the
last decade, but the automobile importer is
at least able to say that thousands of Aus-
tralian workmen are making tyres and
bodies. No such argument can be ad-
vanced by the motion-picture people, who
employ as little Australian labor as they can
get along with. Their films are 98 per cent.
American ; their projecting apparatus is 100
per cent, imported (the "industry” has
done its darnedest to prevent even carbons
for the electric arcs being made in the Com-
monwealth) ; they actually send to the
U.S.A. for a great deal of their printing.
Apart from the few photographers and
such who turn out the topical gazettes —
easily the brightest feature of the average
picture-show—the people employed in the
film trade are mostly agents, ad.-writers,
clerks, showmen, spruikers, operators,
ushers, musicians' (though mechanical sub-
stitutes are often preferred), ticket-sellers
and caretakers; so the claim that it is an
Australian industry is absurd. Of course,
it could be made an industry, and a very
valuable one. But that would mean scien-
tific Protection, plus the prohibition of im-
ported rubbish beyond a certain footage per
annum (say 50 per cent, of the average for
the last 10 years). Asa few votes would
be risked thereby, politicians avoid this sub-
ject with enthusiasm.
' ♦
The State and the Orphan Girl.
From one who thinks further changes are
necessary:—
The man Williams, now lying under the shadow
of the gallows, said from the dock in Sydney that
the reason he took the lives of his three little girls
was that he preferred them to die rather than pass
into the keeping' of the State. He further said that
if they entered one of the State institutions they
would only be fitted for the most menial positions
in life, and would be at the mercy of the first
smooth-tongued scoundrel who chose to take advan-
tage of them. In addition he asserted that most of
the girls on the streets came from these institutions.
Could a more ghastly accusation be made against
the State?
What are the facts? Nowadays in Williams’s
State of N. S. Wales, ‘‘State girls” are housed at
the Glebe, apart from all other girls. Prom there
they are “boarded-out” to people who feel disposed
to take them. The State allows 10s. per week for
each child so placed. Most of the people who take
the children are poor, and the monetary' allowance :s
the chief attraction. They' are, in short, something
that a little money may r be made out of. When
the child reaches the age of 14 the allowance ceases,
and she is then supposed to earn her own keep. To
put it bluntly, she is sent out to work, generally as
a servant. This is at the age of 14, just when she
should have the guiding hand of a mother. As she
has no mother the State undertakes the part. And
sends her out to earn her own living at 14! Of
course the Child Welfare Department will say: “We
have inspectors. They look after the children till
such time as they' go off the State.” Quite true;
but is an occasional visit from an inspector what
one would call “looking after” a motherless girt,
especially at the critical time of her life? Some
few months back the police discovered that a little
State girl had been boarded-out to a family whose
three sons had bad criminal records. They' mustered
between them some 17 or 18 convictions. A pretty
record truly', and a fine Faoin's den to “board out”
a State girl to!
When the girt reaches the age of 18 she auto-
matically goes “off the State.” What is she fit for
then? Not a great deal. She is not w : hat one
would call educated ; the State does not bother much
about educating its wards. ■ She rarely has any nice
companions; how could she meet them under the
conditions under which she has lived ? If she makes
good it is to her infinite credit.
Until a little while back the treatment was far
less satisfactory even than this. Then these girls
were actually' housed at the Girls’ Shelter at Pad-
dington, which was used also for housing girls whom
it was necessary to keep in detention for breaches
of the law—street-walking and so on. One can
imagine what sort of a mixture would be there.
As I have said, that system has now been changed. But
in our own days—in the day's of some of the people
who now control the Department—that was the
system. And what is the offence of these girls?
Simply this: that it is their great misfortune to be,
in most instances, orphans. Not for a moment do
I suggest that Williams was justified. But how far
is the State responsible —that is to say, how far are
we responsible—-for the fears that obsess such as he (
The Spreading; Gallows Tree.
Deab Bulletin, — Angus Murray, of Mel-
bourne, lias been hanged, which is far from
nice, and apparently Williams, of Sydney,
will be hanged, which is not pleasant either.
The alternative seems to be life imprison-
ment, which, of course, isn’t "life” at
all, especially if the convict has friends
with a “pull,” unless he makes the mistake
of dying too soon. That is also disagree-
able.* Imprisonment, I suppose, brutalise?
the prisoner, which hanging doesn’t, though
I have no doubt that the latter brutalises
the hangman, unless, as is likely enough,
he was such a complete ruffian before he
took on Mr. Dennis’s employment that no
further degeneration is possible. I don’t
think capital punishment made Dennis any
worse, though what it may have done to
his successor, the man who hanged Dennis,
is a different matter. But another side to
the question (it is a question of many sides!
is that being a keeper of bad human beings
in a dull, monotonous gaol is about as soul-
deadening and soul-destroying a trade as
can be imagined. It matters nothing
whether any one of them is there for life in
lieu of hanging or not. The contents or
the gaol add up to any number of life sen-
tences. And it is doubtful if being keeper
and herdsman to a lot of mad human beings
in an asylum isn’t as undermining, or even
more so I believe that most lunatic-keepers
become ’ brutes if they keep lunatics long
enough, and that many doctors who have
an extensive practice in lunacy become
prettv mad themselves, though they gener-
ally go on practising. Yet I don’t suppose

even the most rabid humanitarian would
propose to free all prisoners (let alone all
lunatics), or never to arrest any of them.
Almost every orthodox party is prepared to
swear that it is a grievous sin to take a
human life, though the Almighty does it
often enough, quite apart from the fact ilia*
the Old Testament reeks with death sen-
tences, said to be of divine origin. That
is to say, it is a sin to take away the balance
of a life on a scaffold, but it is none to
smother it in a cell. The only good point
I know about flogging is that it is a con-
densed punishment, like the 2oz. tin with
a whole ox compressed into it, and doesn’t
drag its weary length. Speaking of demoral-
ising occupations, I think surgery is one,
likewise nursing. At the same time, and
to prevent misconception, I
don’t believe in letting madmen
off with a fine. A great deal
of eloquence is spent on the
triumphs which science and
piety and other etceteras have
achieved in keeping alive the
deformed, the diseased, the half-
witted, and, of course, by not
hanging them, the criminal.
Still more pride is taken in the
reduction of the death-rate at
the far end, and the vast ex-
tension of the average span of
life into the senile and unpro-
ductive stage. The increase in
the population of most countries
which keep records has in con-
sequence grown during the past
century with such velocity that
the limitation of the birth-rate
is now advocated in all manner
of quarters where, a few years
ago, the idea was regarded as
blasphemy against Scripture
and revolt against decency. The
proposition is that it will be
necessary to have fewer young
people, so that there may be more
old people, to say nothing of more
bad people and mad people and
ill-shaped people. Certainly a
healthy young woman can’t well
afford to have another baby if
she is helping to support and
possibly tend three aged grand-
parents—one bedridden and two
cantankerous. It has been cal-
culated by sanguine but well-
informed authorities that in an-
other half-century the average
age of the most advanced com-
munities may be 62 years, in
consequence of which they will
be a darned sight more saga-
cious than joyful. These are
some of my views on capital
punishment, but 1 have more.—

Bruce, Protectionist.
One good thing has come out
of the Prime Minister’s visit to
post-war Britain. Before he
started on his travels doubts
were felt regarding his fiscal
opinions—doubts born of his
English training, his Flinders-
lane; environment and his asso-
ciation first with the ex-Free-
traders Hughes and Pearce
and then with some rabid anti-
tariffists in the Country party.
But the misery he saw in Eng-
land convinced him that Cob-
denism is as pathetic a futility
as pacifism, of which it is the
economic counterpart. Return-
ing, he astonished some alleged
Protectionists in the National-
ist group by deciding that the
contract for the 14 locomotives
required on the Commonw*eaith
railways should be given to a
Victorian firm, even though
lower tenders were received
from foreign manufacturers
who pay neither Australian
wages nor Australian taxes.
And last week, being booked
to address an assemblage of
farmers and graziers at Sydney
Royal Show, he forgot Flin-
ders-lane, the Argus, Browse
and Gregory, and spoke in
these good Australian terms :—
The policy of Australia, endorsed by an overwhelnv
iiiginajority ot our people, is one of Protection. To
Lm C u- subscnbe a^....for it lam prepared
to fight. We are a young people, with all our indus-
tries in their infancy. Are we prepared to allow
industries to be strangled by the well-
established industries of older countries... .to see our
standard of living reduced by the competition of
countries where men and women are no better than
bondslaves? A Protective tariff is the oily method
ot rendering assistance to loial industry" That
assistance has been afforded equally to our primary
and secondary industries, although it is too often
believed that under the tariff assistance is only o-iven
to our secondary industries. In the ease of our
primary industries it has enabled them to reach a
point where they are able to supply the whole of our
local requirements. Do the primary producers believe
they could have reached that position if,
throughout the struggling days of their growth, they
had been subjected to untrammelled competition
from countries employing t olored labor, from coun-
tries with a standard of living far inferior to our
OW J'« ant * roni countries with a great home market
and a surplus production which thev were prepared
to dump into Australia?
The last question may be passed on to those
Foreign-trade Cockies who are forever com-
plaining of “the iniquitous duties on agri-
cultural and horticultural implements and
machinery” while demanding that the tariff
on things like wine, brandy, maize, millet,
potatoes, onions, bananas, oranges, lemons,
raisins, currants, jam and canned fruits
shall be as high as the heavens. The Prime
Minister referred next to the problem of the

rJl!? '• a ? I nm C Minister, but it cannot
00 . airl s r Judged until particulars are forth-
c°ming, and until it is shown that hard-
pressed manufacturing industries are not to
be sacrificed in the process of building up
the fund out of which exporters of raisins,
currants, butcher’s meat and so forth will
get their bonuses. It may be that the Gov-
ernment is counting on the Customs revenue
continuing on the present unhealthy scale or
coming in at a rate even more monstrous.
If so it will have to be told that the very
size of that revenue is a sign that the tariff
is not doing its job—that, in the conditions
brought about by depression in Britain, de-
based currencies on the Continent and the
accumulation of gold in the U.S.A., together
with mass production and other compara-
tively recent industrial developments in that
country, duties which might have been effec-
tive before the war have now merely a
revenue incidence as far as many Australian
manufacturers are concerned. Hence the
ever-rising flood of imports, particularly in
the iron and steel and textile groups; hence
also the inflated income from Customs,
which makes the Treasurer’s annual estimate
look foolish, and the prevalence of foundries,
factories and workshops which have had to
reduce hands or shut down altogether. On
the evidence of the import and unemployed
returns these industries are not getting the
I rotection for which the Prime Minister
declares himself ready to fight. If they are
granted that Protection, the Customs revenue
should sensibly decline. The Government
will have to be mindful of these considera-
tions in working out its new scheme.
Clouds in South Africa.
The defeat of a Government candidate at
VV akkerstroom, in the Southern Transvaal,
has decided Smuts to go to the country in
June, and it looks as if Hertzog, the Repub-
lican leader, is about to have an innings at
last. An irreconcilable at Vereeniging, he
controls a vast organisation which is as
bitterly anti-British, in spite of lip-service,
as Sinn Fein itself. After the De Wet-
Beyers rebellion in 1914, and again after
the Red rising on the Band, he was deeply
suspect, but either evidence of complicity
was lacking or he was too powerful in South
Africa to be called to account. There is an
odd pact between Labor and the Dopper, and
the question is how long it will last. The
two elements have nothing at
all in common except their hos-
tility to Smuts. Yet they may
mix for a while with vigorous
stirring, and even in that short
space of time a lot of mischief
may be done. Cables tell us
that already young Afrikanders
are parading the streets of
.Johannesburg singin g the
“Volkslied,” the national an-
them of the old Republics. But
that in itself does not matter
much. It is among the farm-
ing communities of the Free
State, the Transvaal and the
north of Cape Colony that the
real peril to the British con-
nection lies. Twenty-two years
of improved educational and
transport facilities, and of
momentous political changes in
other parts of the world, have
altered the Dopper not at all.

“Robot’’ : Like the bricklayer,
the cabinet-maker and the
letterpress machinist, before
they can get a job, must be
furnished with an O.K. card by
their union; an employer who
takes on a man without such
a card runs the risk of the
true-blue unionists in his em-
ploy being called out by the
union. I know a unionist of
20 years’ standing who has had
the misfortune to fall into
arrears with his subscriptions,
and his union will not issue
him an O.K. card until he be-
comes financial. Every time he
looks like getting a job the
same trouble crops up. The
man cannot pay his union dues
because he is not allowed to
earn the money, and he is nor
allowed to earn the money be-
cause he has not paid his union
dues. Incidentally, the last job
he failed to get was filled by
a man with an O.K. card who
had only recently arrived in
this country.

A note from the fish-shop next
door:—.
George of Greece, the lasi on a
long list of deposed kings, has sent
an impassioned letter (or it may be a
postcard) from his place of exile, de-
manding immediate restoration. . His
late country has nearly completed its
century of Liberty and Progress, and
has really accomplished wonders in
recovering Unredeemed Greece from
adjacent bad characters; but it has
had its troubles. It tried being a
republic; but President Capo
d’lstrias, a really great man, was
slain by two brigands, who were after-
wards walled up by special Act of
Parliament, and left there. It be-
came a kingdom, but after a reign of
29 years King Otho, a deaf German,
was run out. At a referendum to
decide on a new form of government
he got one vote. George I. reigned
•10 years, and was killed by another
brigand. His son Constantixe was
deposed twice. Alexander, of the
next generation, who reigned between
his father, so to speak, was fatally bitten
bv a poor relation and died of blood-
poisoning. The power of his brother,
George 11., was undermined by the
rumpus with Italy. All the same,
there is no special reason to believe
that the nation wanted to get
rid of him. If he had dissolved
Parliament when it threatened to
depose him, called to the army and the navy and the
police to rally round him, barricaded the palace
with furniture, and commanded a new election, he
might have lived long as the idol of his people,
and died in the perfume of sanctity. But like many
other recent monarchs he let go the possession which
is nine points of the law, the tenth being possession
also. The big statesman, Eleuthehios Venizelos,
who used to count in rows of this sort, is now an
aged wreck, and small men are pottering in high
places. One day M. Skunkouxderous has resigned,
and the next M. Skoundrelopoulos has formed a
new Ministry, and there is a good deal of con-
fusion. So the reply to the ex-royal postcard is
likely to be delayed.

POLITICAL
POINTS.
The U.S.A. have adopted the Johnston
Immigration Bill, which “turns the key” on
Japanese immigrants. Incidental cables- were
to the effect that the Japanese Ambassador
had stated that “the new law would seriously
offend the pride of Japan and involve ques-
tions of good faith and honor”; that the
Jap Prime Minister had declared emigration
to be “ithe only solution of vital Japanese
social questions”; and that the Japanese War
Department “is making conscription effective
in Japan's colonies from next August.” It
all heavily discounts the Charlton view of *
a Pacific made safe, for democracy by the
goodwill of the Powers controlling it. Actu-
ally, of course, this part of the world is the
same sort of powder-magazine that Europe
was 10 years ago ; and if the explosion comes
with Australia still unarmed the worst suf-
ferers are going to be those who support the
misguided Charlton.
Treasurer Earle Page has been digging
into State debts and discovering things.
Leaving the Commonwealth liabilities but of
the reckoning, interest takes £123 of every
£1000 which Australia produced in 1921-
22, as against £55 only 10 years earlier.
After putting the whole of the net earnings
of the railways to the credit of the interest
account, in 1911 the balance of the bill took
£25 out of every £1000 of Australia’s produc-
tion : in 1921 no less than £99 out of every
£1000 had to be paid out. The figures show
that loan expenditure hasn’t increased pro-
duction to any extent worth mentioning. In
other words, it has been money spent mostly
by politicians in corrupting the constituen-
cies and buying votes. And the fool-public
encourages them.
The X. S. Wales A.L.P. Conference began
its deliberations in the holy calm of Good
Friday. A proposal with which it will
wrestie, when (or if) it has settled the rows
between Willis and Bailey, Loughlin and
J. J. McGirr, Lang and Molesworth, the
Worker and the Labor Daily, Communists
mid Moderates, pro-executives and anti-execu-
tives, and about 47 other feuds arising from’
sectarianism and ballot-faking, is a levy
on capital. “The world’s leading econo-
mists” (names unmentioned) are alleged to
favor the idea, and Britain being coldly hos-
tile it is reckoned just the thing for N. S.
Wales—a borrowing country without a
landed aristocracy, or a class drawing in-
terest from foreign investments, or rich rail-
way companies; where manufacturers are
struggling to keep their heads above water,
cattlemen, orchardists and wheatgrowers are
receiving Government assistance, and, accord-
ing to Labor politicians, 12,000 breadwinners
are unemployed. Australian politicians used
to take a pride in tackling Australian pro-
blems on Australian lines. The tendency
nowadays is to borrow any exploded foreign
superstitition that will save them the trouble
of thinking out a policy.
“Increased production, with the successful
marketing of that production, is the only way
in which Australia can stand up to its huge
national debt,” says Federal Treasurer Earle
Page. But that’s not enough. Earle Page
might increase his income from £10,000 to
£20,000 a year and still go bung. Outgoings
have to be watched as well as income. Aus-
tralia, with increased production and im-
proved marketing, might still be in the soup
unless it also cut down its expenditure,
especially on goods for which it has to send
money abroad.
Queensland pastoralistsstill don't know'
where they are. The agreement come to be-
tween them and Theodore in London :'was
that the rents existing on May 30 next should
be the maximum until the leases expire. At
present the Land Courts are congested with
applications for reduction of rentals under
the Review’ of Rents Act. which wrns passed
to give relief to those suffering from drought
conditions. Pastoralists jubilantly expected
that the reduced rentals which they were so
sure of getting would be considered as “those
existing on May 30 next.” Their enthusiasm
has, however, been damped by the announce-
ment that no decisions are to be made until
all the cases have been dealt with ; and as
it will be impossible for the Land Courts to
deal wfith anything like all the cases before
the end of May, this quite removes any doubt
as to which will be the prevailing rate on
that date. Had the 1920(“Repudiation”) Act
not been passed the highest rental the State
could have obtained for the second 10-year
period would have been 90s. per sq. mile;
actually a good many are up to 140 s. So they
were looking forwmrd to that reduction pretty
hard.
The wild-dog menace is beginning to
worry the N.S.W. Lands Department as well
as the Western Lands Board. Dogs from
over the Queensland border are playing
havoc on the holdings of settlers in the
Moree district; and ordinary rabbit-proof
w'ire-netting will not stop them. The Pas-
tures Protection Act provides for the supply
of rabbit-proof netting upon easy terms, and
there is a loud cry that the Act should be
amended to include dog-proof ditto. But, as
such an amendment wmuld result in a rush
of applications, it wall probably be found
that pressure of business renders it imprac-
ticable to amend the Act at. present. If
sheep had votes it w’ould be quite a different
matter.
The Harwell Government in the last days
of its life in South Aus. had an easy job in
deciding to accept the £400,000 tender of the
Broken Hill Prop, for rails and fishplates
—the big Australian co.’s offer was the low~
est. And if it hadn’t been it should have
been accepted all the same- Orders like that
are much more important than they look on
MAKING EVERYBODY HAPPY.
“Mr. Bruce’s new policy is to devote the whole, or portion, of the Customs surplus to subsidising the
production of the primary industries by means of bounties on exports—a form of recompense to the
agriculturists for their contributions to the tariffs. Incidentally it will perhaps serve to weld the
Country party to their Nationalist friends.”
the surface: they keep works going while
they are feeding real secondary industries
with raw materials. These industries —the
manufacture of pots and pans and such like
—don’t call for any tremendous amount of
raw material; but they do mean a tremen-
dous lot of employment. No order for the
big bread-and-butter lines ought ever to go
out of the country.
When a Premier can pick his own col-
leagues he generally does his best to give
every part of the country representation in
the Cabinet; it is one of the minor draw-
backs of a caucus-scuffle for portfolios that
the geographical aspect goes for nothing. In
W.A.’s new Labor Ministry two of the six
members represent Fremantle, two are from
Gel-aldton, and two from the goldfields, one
from a district far gone in decay. The only
Minister who may be able to claim some
faint electoral connection with the huge
Wheat Belt is Drew, who has yet to win his
way back to the Leg. Council after an
absence of six years. There is nobody from
the South-West or South, nobody from the
North, and nobody, which perhaps matters
less, from the metropolis or suburbs.
Colebatch, the Westralian Agent-General,
has been dining with Thomas, the British
“Colonial'’ Secretary, and telling him about
Mitchell's group-settlements. Thomas, of
course, was “profoundly impressed.” It
wasn’t for him to know that a Royal Com-
mission, consisting mostly of Nationalist
M’s.L.C., has (1) estimated the cost of
group-settling the Peel estate at £1,250,000,
instead of the £267,000 mentioned by Cole-
batch when he was Mitchell’s representative
in the Second Chamber, and (2) suggested
that many of the settlers be given better
blocks, their present holdings being hopeless.
Nor was Thomas informed that magnificent
timber is being destroyed that vegetables
and things may be grown on soil which is
not likely to be worth the £3O or so per acre
that the clearing gangs absorb. Future
generations will suffer for this insensate
waste.
Huxham, Minister for Education, will step
into his ex-colleague Fihelly’s shoes as
Queensland Agent-General. He has been up
south lately inquiring into the treatment of
mental defectives —though Heaven knows all
he will find out in the south is how to neglect
the big national question. Queensland, in
fact, has done almost as much as any State:
it at least has classes in several centres for
sub-normal children. But sub-normal child-
ren and mental defectives are not quite the
same; and even Victoria, where Prof. Berry
has done great propaganda work, while it
has a couple of schools for mental defectives,
maintains them only as day schools. Hux-
ham, having interested himself in the sub-
ject, might be asked by the Federal Govern-
ment to send along the results of any in-
quiries and observations he might make in
Europe.
A serpent has intruded into that Queens-
land Eden where the out-of-work gets paid
by the State for being like that. At Innis-
fail the other day a drunk faced the local
P.M. and admitted having mopped up his
out-of-work money, drawn the day before.
He was informed that a new regulation en-
joined that a daily list of drunks was to be
handed by the police to the Director of
Labor in every centre. In future the hop
will be the forbiddeu fruit, and the garden
will seem less lovely than heretofore.
Adopting the sentiments of the Health
Commission, Dr. Argyle, Vic. Minister for
Health, has put forward a scheme for spend-
ing £250,000, spread over five years or more,
in fighting tuberculosis and other communi-
cable diseases. Buildings would cost £.120,000,
and maintenance is estimated at £40,000
p.a., or double the outlay on the present
lackadaisical campaign against t.b. Apart
from the alleviation of suffering,. Argyle
stresses the economic value of the lives thaf
would be saved. His plan will doubtless t»e
adopted if he succeeds Lawson as Premier,
but there is a stiff fight ahead of him if he
remains a mere subordinate. Roads and
bridges are sure vote-winners; the war on
disease distinctly, isn’t.
A bit of history :
In the controversy excited by the anti-Japanese
provisions of the new U.S. Immigration Bill the
White Australia policy has been quoted. Ex-Senator
Keating relates in Launceston Examiner how the
Alien Restriction Act, with the all-important educa-
tional test clause, got through the Senate when he
was Government whip. Everyone in the second
chamber favored the White Australia principle which
the Reps, had already accepted, but for purely party
reasons the Opposition fought the educational test,
proposing instead a straight-out color test. At first
the numbers were in its favor, but cne or two color-
testers weakened, and then Stanifortli Smith went
out to get his hair cut. He would have voted
against the educational test; but the division was
taken in his absence, and the Government won by
12 to 11; so the ' educational test policy was estab-
lished in due forhi.
A settlement of the alleged gas trouble in
Melbourne seems very little nearer. The big
co. has told the Government that it is ready
to sell to the municipalities at a price to be
fixed by arbitration; but the harder the coun-
cil’s advisers look the less sure they feel
that they could improve on the co.’s rates.
It seems shocking that a gas supplier or any
other public utility should put up its prices
100 p.c. or so within a few years; but the
Government is no better off though it has
done it on the railways, and Merely Mary
says she is worse off though she has more
than done it in the kitchen. Besides, the
councils remember the Electricity Commis-
sion and wonder what demand there is
going to be for gas in the future. There is
plenty of room for gas-regulation in Mel-
bourne, and plenty of examples elsewhere to
imitate —or avoid.
“0.P.H.” : Scenting the possibility of an-
other Composite Ministry after the general
election, Allan, leader of Vic. Parliamentary
Cockies, is holding out the olive branch.
He does not see any necessity, he declares,
for any bitterness on the hustings—nothing,
for instance, that it will be difficult to unsav
afterwards. With Lawson side-tracked into
the Speaker’s. chair, Allan evidently thinks
he could make a compact with Peacock apd
Argyle. He had six months of the pair in
the Composite Cabinet, and should know
something of them.
Whether the advance guard of British
Labor proposes to put the repudiation Of
the public debt on its programme is not
known, but its official organ, the Daily
Herald, has cursed Ramsay Macdonald by
all the little gods for replying to Russia’s
request for a big loan with a condition that
the applicant must first do certaiu things.
For one thing, it was to “acknowledge” the
1746 millions that it owes to J. Bull, even
though acknowledgment may bring neither
principal nor interest any nearer. This is
declared to be “interference in the internal
affairs of Russia,” and if the repudiation of
external debt is a purely internal affair then
default has become respectable.
THE LINE THAT JACK BUILT.
[For The Bulletin.]
This is the line that Jack built.
This is the crowd that wanted the line that Jack
built. .
This is the member, old and tried, who used to re-
mark with a lot of pride that he could get any-
thing for his seat through' saving Ministers from
defeat, by standing fast to them in the game of
getting the line that Jack built.
This is the loan they raised to squander on the rail-
way-line from Nowhere to Yonder, to please the
member who used to say that “everything would
come his way,” as long as lie and a dozen others
■—coarse, unscrupulous, venal brothers—“voted
straight” for Jack and his cobbers, who looked
like professional public robbers (and certainly
were consummate jobbers), and, in return for
their kindly support, were given the line that
Jack built.
This is the “estimate as to cost”—of course, no cash
could ever be lost-—but, strangely enough and
tearful to say, none of Jack’s lines could be made
to pay! So, presently, Ministers had to state
that “the cost far exceeded the estimate” ; but,
as the shameless job had been done, and Hie
line was there and the seat again won, and the
raucous member, so old and tried, was travelling
(free) round the countryside, explaining that
but for him end his mates their opponents
would ruih “this best of States!’-’-—nobody
bothered, or used harsh terms (for taxpayers
are a race of Worms) ; and now there is one
train a week less; and the system’s got in a
frightful mess; while what it is costing I leave
you to guess, for I’m sick of the line that
Jack built!

THE DEAD SOUL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Listen, O listen, I hear the tread
Of funeral steps and a death drum’s roll;
Tell me, tell me, what is the dead?”
Quiet, my son; ’tis a nation’s soul.
’Tis a nation’s soul that has gone the way
Of the million mourners that follow it, son ;
For only the dead men mareh to-day,
The men who died in a war they won.
Out of the lands that are wide and free,
Over the seas to their mother land,
They tramped, my son, for the destiny
Of a people proud and a vision grand.
And they envied no prize but a nation’s life;
But a nation’s life and they fought for it, son:
And a widow is weeping who was a wife,
And a mother had sons who has never a one.
So they follow the corpse to the clammy hole
That shall take it and hide it for evermore:
’Tis a nation’s dead with a nation’s soul—
And the grave is gaping at Singapore.

The Union is developing into an excel-
lent proposition for its proprietors: last
year’s profits were more than double the
average for the six years to 1918. They
gave 151 p.c. on paid capital, so, after pay-
ing 10 p.c., the lay-by was slightly more
than half the amount distributed. In its 39
years the co. has added only £lO,OOO of bonus
scrip (in £5OOO lots three and four years
ago) to its cash-paid capital of £lOO,OOO,
some of which had been issued at a premium.

anything like the scale of those in other big
trustee offices; down to 1916 the eo. paid no
more than 7 p.c., and though the rate has
gradually risen since, earnings for some years
were probably affected by the outlay on the
development of the Sydney branch estab-
lished in 1915. The co. is also in Brisbane,
having made a start there five years after
commencing business in Melbourne. The
strides taken in recent years are shown by
the following comparisons :

Twenty years ago expenses took 61 p.c. of
earnings; to-day they take 73 p.c. And
still the profit margin is growing steadily.
The co. is, perhaps, doing a little better than
its published figures indicate: each year por-
tions of the first commissions on new busi-
ness are laid aside as income not wholly
earned, and available if current commissions
won’t pay the cost of services rendered the
estates. Perhaps recent disclosed profits
have been assisted by transfers of such
accumulations made in the past and not re-
quired.
The size of the Union’s trustee business is
not disclosed. The directors are a little more
confiding than they used to be, and at the
recent meeting shareholders were told that
for the previous six years estates with a book
value of slightly more than 91 millions
had been captured. An annual addition of
approximately 11 million is good going, and
the total under control must now be very
large. The Union is no doubt now reaping
the benefit of having opened in Sydney,
with a Board of pastoral big-guns: Henry
Braddon, of Dalgety’s, James Ashton, R. M.
Pitt, W. H. Mackay and James Kidd. Capi-
tal issued is in 100,000 shares of 50s. each,
on which 225. has been paid up ; Bs, is callable
by the directors, and 20s. more per share is
available if required in a wind-up, giving
£140,000 backing for clients in addition to
funds held by the co. At February 29 those
funds totalled £154,385 and were laid out in
the best of investments:—

Though shareholders are doing very well
with 10 p.c. divs., the rapid expansion of the
business and the large surpluses left after
paying the divs. (nearly £39.000 of visible
reserves have accumulated) suggest that good
management will soon give sweeter pickings.

Latest profits were very disappointing, par-
ticularly as earnings were apparently
not affected by any further decline in stock
values. When the 1923 accounts were pre-
sented book values of stocks and book debts
were reported to be “at bedrock.” The prin-
cipal trouble has been that while highly
competitive trading has restricted profit mar-
gins the management has been unable
to reduce costs to correspond. Twelve
months ago the directors claimed that Bris-
bane was "the keenest market for softgoods
in the Commonwealth,” and they considered
that, as wages and salaries were taking half
the gross profit, the only way to give share-
holders better divs. was to increase turn-
over. The re-organisation of portion of the
business, which necessitated a little addi-
tional capital outlay, did effect some im-
provement towards the close of the financial
year, but turnover generally was affected by
the State’s long drought. Gross profits fell
from £177,136 for the 1923 financial year to
£157.310 for the past 12 months; but ex-
penditure was reduced only from £154,833 to
£148,065. The better seasonal outlook, the
prospects of cotton and the likelihood of a
squatting and mining revival—not overlook-
ing the boom which will follow the opening
up of the Mt. Isa silver-lead field if it be-
comes the big thing it looks on early develop-
ment—all give hope that the depression which
has been pressing old-established concerns
like Finney’s is only temporary. Considering
all things, this co. has not done badly: in
three years £17,373 of profit has been made
while keeping stocks at bedrock replacement
value and providing for' customers’ doubtful
accounts. Meanwhile shareholders have had
savings bank interest on their capital, and
old hands a bit more if bonus scrip (£54,514
of £275,993 came out of reserves) is taken
into consideration. Of course, buyers at the
top of the boom, when divs. went to 10 p.c.,
have fared badly.
The following figures show an improve-
ment in the balance-sheet position and assure
shareholders that, given good management,
their investment is healthy:—
1915. 1921. 1923. 1924.

Cash & invest-
ments .. 16,334 21.934 12,713 11,855
Liabilities, stocks and book debts were all
down on the year. Liabilities at January 31
were made up of £39 000 of interminable 5
p.c. debentures, £46.599 mortgage on
properties, and £95,354 of sundry credi-
tors. Against the floating debt were stocks,
customers’ accounts and cash assets totalling
£338,178. Every £1 share had the bafeking
of tangible assets with a book value of almost
21s. 9d. when the div. had been paid; never-
theless, the market, valuin'* the investment
almost entirely on div. performances, offers
only 13s. 3d. for the scrip. The co. took over
the business just 20 vears ago with a
paid capital of under £30,000 and £12,700
owr'g to the Finney estate- goodwill and
preliminaries ran into £17,566, but all in-
tangibles were replaced by assets of sub-
stance early in the co.’s career. A feature of
the business nowadays is that £125 000 or
so is in premises.

“The figures of the Profit and Loss account.”
the directors say, “show that, as antimpited
last year, there has been an all-round im-
provement in business.” The published
accounts do nothing of the kind: gross pro-
fits for 1922 were £188.106; last year only
£155,401. However, last year’s earnings
were loaded with unspecified provisions for
bad and doubtful debts and for depreciation
of premises, which did not figure in the pre-
vious two lots of accounts. No doubt the
co. did do better in the period under review,
and disclosed figures evidently suffered from
the necessity for extinguishing losses incurred
in other years. But so far as the
published accounts tell, the swing-back of
net profits to normal was due entirely to
smaller taxation demands. Here are figures
for three years :—•
1921. 1922. 1923.
Gross profits .. .. £145,223 £188,125 £155,416
Exes, and English taxes 72,355 65,803 61,4'‘2
£72,868 £122,322 £93,944

M.L. taxes .. .. 41,343 54,627 10,093
Loss . . .. £9,605
Profit .. .. £21,643 £38,356
In the 1922 financial year Dominion taxes
took altogether £84,627, but £86,000 of it
was met out of a contingency reserve; latest
earnings were called upon to contribute
£44 534 less to the Dominion Treasury than
in the previous 12 months, that reduction in
itself being more than the total net profit
disclosed for the 1923 accounting period.
On the strength of the improvement, the
div. rate was elevated to 11-J p.c. That left
a substantial surplus, but reserves were still
£27,329 less than was shown prior to Maori-
land’s post-war collapse. Total visible re-
serves amounted to £BOl 862 when the final
div. had been paid, and there are also inter-
nal contingency reserves of unknown dimen-
sions. Paid capital is a quarter-million, so
on total funds the 11} p.c. div. gives a very
moderate return. Results are the poorer
because the co. has the use of £782,675 of
debentures, on which it is paying an aver-
age of approximately 5£ p.c. The co. last
year was working on approximately
£1,335,000 of its own funds and debentures,
which together earned £83.851 net, giving
slightly less than 63 p.c. That is a small
return, taking into consideration the risks of
the pastoral finance business, and assuming
that nothing very large was dropped into
the contingency stocking. Assets at Sep-
tember 30 last were as follows:-
Cash and investments .. .. £308,934
Stocks .. 174,200
Liquid ■ assets .. .. £483,134
Mortgages, foreclosures, etc. ~ ‘ 983,603
Wool and produce advances .. 67,467
Sundry debtors .. .. .. 347,685
Premises, plant, etc. .. .. 61,197
Total assets .. £1,943,086
Floating debts, which include the contin-
gency reserves, amounted to £589,798, and
were £106,664 larger than liquid assets. That
balance and debentures totted up £889,389,
and had the protection of advances, pro-
perties, etc., with a book value of £1,459,952,
equal to 325. 9d. for every £1 not covered
by liquid assets. The security for creditors
was, therefore, unquestionable. In addition,
shareholders could be called upon to put
up another million, the 125,000 £.lO shares
having been called to only £2 each. Pro-
vided recent provisions for doubtful accounts
and any re-arrangement of contingency re-
serves have been adequate to cover losses
which resulted from the slump in land
values and from the sudden collapse of pro-
duce prices three years back, this co. should
do better. Since the latest accounts
closed markets for wool, meat and dairy pro-
duce have shown big improvements, and pro-
vided the South Island’s so-called drought
has not cut deeply into turnover commission
earnings for the current year should be much
larger, and the co.’s weaker securities should
become stronger.

Though earnings last year were a trifle less
than those for the previous 12 months, when
the ordinary div. rate slumped to 5 p.c.,
the directors have again paid 10 p.c. and
dipped into reserves for £1047 to do it. In-
come is almost all from rents and divs. The
co. originally took over the Taits’ movie
interests —they were pioneers in Melbourne
—but it later joined the big combine. The
co. holds £87.616 of scrip in the General
Film Co. of Australasia, which in turn is
split into Union Theatres. Ltd., and Aus-
tralasian Films, Ltd. The face value of
the scrip issued to Amalgamated Pictures
was much in excess of its own book values,
but, fortunately, the directors were not in-
duced to write up capital to correspond; in-
stead they show a “capital realisation
reserve” of £59,663 against the General Film
holding. The co. also has £11,700 of deben-
tures in the G.F. Other movie assets ?re
the Majestic Theatre leasehold, St. Kilda
1 heatre freehold and shares in the North-
cote, Moonee Ponds and Geelong show-
houses. Returns from its own properties
have been fairly steady, but other earnings
have been erratic:—
Properties. Divs., etc. Expenses.
.. .. £3798 £10,658 £2836
1917 .. .. 5833 3,052 4167

1923 . . . . 4820 3,533 1675
1924 . . .. 4888 3,038 1267
The returns from the combine and from
subsidiary theatre cos. have been very dis-
appointing, £103,316 of shares and deben-
tures having given only £3038 last year. Of
course, since Amalgamated Pictures did not
capitalise the surplus paper received from
the combine, results look much better when
the returns are estimated on shareholdings
less the £59,663 capital realisation account.
Earnings of the theatres have lately been
affected a good deal by heavy outlay on
renovations, etc., necessary to rejuvenate
them to compete with other picture “palaces.”
Balance-sheet movements over nine years
have been as follows:
~ 1915. 1922. 1923. 1924
Mortgages .. £15,500 £3,500 £3,000 £2,500

Cash, etc. . . 6,892 9,911 11,964 11,281
Apart from the mortgages there are practi-
cally no liabilities, and at February 29 tin*
co. had cash in hand easily covering the
final divs. at the higher rate. Amalga-
average on ordinaries has been only
about 7$ p.c. p.a., so there have not beer
the fortunes in the business which many
people expected when they rushed to buy
scrip in the early boom days.

The directors selected an appropriate date
for this year’s meeting of shareholders; John
Grice, Wm. Jamieson and Bowes Kelly,
three of Melbourne’s weightiest, met them
on All Fools’ Day, and the “joke” w T as in
these figures shown by the accounts: —

Arrears of pref. divs... .. . . .. 40,000
Accumulated losses .. .. .. .. £80,545
Excess of liabilities over liquid assets .. 96,631
The co. slipped deeper into the mire during
the past 12 months; traffic receipts wen*
£14,995 larger than working costs, but
lessors, debenture-holders, coupon-collectors
and others ivere waiting open-mouthed for
any crumbs. Portion of the railway is held
on lease, and rent for the year ran into
£10,370, and the interest bill for the period
was £13,189. So the books closed with a
loss of £10,849 for the 12 months after
charging £2285 for depreciation. For many
years the co. has been unable to settle with
its creditors, and some cash which might
have been available for them has been
required for renewals—the Burnie-Guildford
section was entirely relaid a couple of years
ago, and only last year £3OBO w r as taken to
repair damage done by landslips. At Decem-
ber 31 there were debts of £124,263 to set
against stores, book debts and cash for only
£27,632. The eo.’s financial affairs have so
long been in a horrible tangle that most
shareholders have abandoned hopes of divs.
or even of recovering any of their capital.
Notwithstanding the desperate position so
far as shareholders are concerned the direo-
toi’s pooh-pooh the suggestion that they
should abandon what is practically a dere-
lict. “If operations were suspended,” they
say, “all shareholders’ interests in the eo.

Economy and efficiency are the main points looked
for by modem municipal engineers when considering
new water-main construction. Pioneer Wood Pipe
responds to both demands in the fullest. It is
cheap to buy, light to transport, simple to instal,
and incurs no upkeep. In fact, it is the economy conduit
par excellence. As to efficiency, it neither rusts,
corrodes nor fouls, preserves the volume of its flow
absolutely unimpaired, is unaffected by frost, “bad
soil” or electrolysis, and will safely carry any class
of fluid. Write for our book of full information.

The new British-made “NATIONAL” Vertical
Single Line Suction Gas Engines being installed at
Bathurst, Parkes and Dubbo, N.S.W. For generating
electric energy aggregate 1300 horsepower. The fuel
for these engines at Bathurst and Parkes will, be
from local timber and at Dubbo from coke manu-
factured at the local gas works. The sole agents,
Arthur Leplastrier and Co. Pty., Ltd., of Sydney,
Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane, advise that alter-
nators direct coupled to these engines may be paral-
leled. The maximum cyclical variation of the larger
units should not exceed l in 1485, which is impossible
of accomplishment, with any other type of engine
excepting high-speed steam engines, the fuel costs of
which, however, are excessive.— Advt.

would certainly be lost. It was surely better
to continue working on reasonable lines
than to close down.” In plain English:
“Keep it going, and at the worst some day
we may meet a mug, State or otherwise.”
All the same, it hasn’t been possible to post-
pone another day of reckoning—the direc-
tors must be getting quite used to them.
During the war debenture-holders and lessors
were prevailed upon to allow payment of in-
terest to be deferred for some years, and
besides £172,000 of debentures having fallen
due on January 1 last the co. is faced with
the meeting of deferred obligations and in-
terest thereon in June next year. Obviously
outside backers cannot get their money,
and to keep the wheels moving a new
arrangement has had to be made with them.
A scheme which “appears to the Board
to be fair” is now under consideration, but
details have not been disclosed. Meanwhile
the directors are still hopeful of the Zeehan
district recovering a little of its former acti-
vity : the co. took over the railways when
the old silver city and the Tas. west coast
generally were booming, which accounts for
£lOO,OOO having been paid for “rights and
concessions.” The old Zeehan mining camp
is still dead, though better metal prices
have stirred the dry bones a little. The future
depends a good deal on the extent to which
the Electrolytic Zinc Co. develops its Zeehan
treatment works.

Bendigo gold returns for the first three
months of 1924 when compared with those
of last year look very sick: —
1923. 1924. Decrease.
January .. 3468 oz. 2323 oz. 1145 oz.
February .. 4906 „ 2947 „ 1959 „
March .. 6369 „ 2396 „ 2973 „
With a progressive decline of approximately
IOOOoz. per month, the gold yield would
reach the vanishing-point in June. How-
ever, with three profitable mines producing
between them over 500 oz. per week, and some
help from others, the monthly figure should
hover about 25000 z. This is certainly low,
and once more the cry goes up that the field
is done. That pessimism first found utter-
ance in 1853, when the field was two years
old and the record yearly output of
660,0000 z. had just been made. The cream
of the alluvial was gone, and reef-mining
was unknown. In the following years the
decreasing alluvial returns were not coun-
terbalanced by the slowly-growing reef re-
turns, and the voice of the pessimist was heard
on and off till the boom years of 1870-76. He
has been heard many times since then, but
never was he in such feather as at present.
Students of economics say that under pre-
sent conditions gold-mining in Bendigo _is
an absurdity. They might as well point
out to a “Tatt.’s” addict that the return per
ticket is well below the cost. As long as
Bendigo can produce, at intervals, one of
its rich reefs, the field will go on. It has
always shown a wonderful vitality, and signs
of a revival are not wanting even now.
Bendigo mining is not confined solely to
winning gold. Bast year the London Christ-
mas was working a semi-decomposed “lava”
and manufacturing it into face-powder and
“Old Dutch” cleanser. However, face-
pow'der mining proved unprofitable. This
year the old Morning light mine, near Dia-
mond Hill, has been re-opened, and Bendigo
may soon have a poison-mine. The shaft
is to be unwatered to 350 ft., where a fair-
sized reef of arsenical pyrites is said to
exist. A Melbourne syndicate is behind
the venture.

Interesting experiments on Kalgoorlie ore
indicate possibilities in the wider application
of the flotation process. Crushed ore grad-
ing 23.8dwt. per ton was subjected to flota-
tion and gave a concentrate going 166dwt.
Residues contained 1.32dwt., so the extrac-
tion was 96 p.c. The concentrate will, of
course, have to be roasted, but as it can be
smelted with lead or copper ores even this
expense can be eliminated. For complex
gold ores there seem to be possibilities in
this method of treatment.

Fresh capital is wanted to re-open the
Gladsome mine, at Comet Vale (W.A.).
Years ago this show was proved to 600 ft.,
and about a quarter-million sterling was ex-
tracted, mostly from above the 400 ft. level.
Then the workings were flooded from the
abandoned Sand Queen adjoining, and opera-
tions had to cease. Later on an effort was
made to drain both mines from the Sand
Queen shaft; but it was unsuccessful. A
fair-sized shoot is said to be under water in
the bottom.
Anxious inquiries are being made about
McLeod’s Reward and Lalla Rookh by share-
holders in the East and West. Both shows
are on the distant Pilbarra field (W.A.).
When last heard of, months ago, McLeod’s
Reward had five head of stamps crushing,
and was thinking of erecting another five,
as payable ore in sight was reported to be
plentiful. About the same time Lalla Rookh
announced that it had a 10-head battery
ready to treat 20,000 tons of valuable stuff.
Since then both concerns seem to have been
struck speechless.
Gnow’s Nest, at Yalgoo (W.A.), is for
sale. To date over £50,000 worth of gold
lias been won from this show, and 10s. per
share has been divided among its sharehold-
ers, principally past and present Kalgoorlie
mine managers. A disturbed reef is said to
be the reason for the co.’s willingness to
get out.

A. E. Broue, of Sydney, visited Perth the
other day and induced most of the oil de-
velopment cos. in Northern Westralia, in-
cluding Freney’s, Kimberley Petroleum and
Australian Petroleum Development, to give
options. It is proposed, if Dr. Clapp reports
favorably, to form a limited liability co. with
a working capital of at least £250,000 to
acquire the lot. Broue’s agreement with
Freney’s provides that, should a payable
flow of oil be struck before the option is
exercised, that co. will retain one square
mile of country surrounding the bore site,
though Broue will have the right to purchase
it at a valuation, any bonus payable by the
Commonwealth Government for the discovery
of a payable oil-pool to go to Freney’s. Dr.
Clapp is now’ en route to Freney’s area,
which will be first examined. He expects
to be able to report in a few months how
many, if any, of the areas covered by Broue’s
options are worth while.

The cutting of solid quartz—Bft. wide at
latest—in the Crown South (N.S.W.) tunnel
at 150 ft. in and about 230 ft. vertical, fits
nicely with the announcement concerning
quartz in the south tunnel of the parent
mine. It is corroborative evidence that the
main Crown reef lives at depth the full
length of the Crown lease and into its south-
ern neighbor. A payable strike in the deeper
ground from either tunnel would improve
the prospects of both shows out of sight. In
that event shareholders should demand that
the claims be welded.
* * * *
Christmas Gift, Cootamundra (N.S.W.),
has promised a crushing of 100 tons or more
after the holidays. A rise from the 300 ft.
level has been put up and connected with
the winze from the 200 ft. level, disclosing fair
stoping tonnages. This winze it was which
led to the debacle of last year. Even the
most pessimistic didn’t expect the reef to
peter out in the 50ft. or so of unexplored
ground below it; but the worst happened.
The ore is too complex for ordinary battery
treatment ; the sliming precludes a successful
recovery. The mine, however, gives no pro-
mise that it will provide the funds for cyanid-
ing, and shareholders are not in the mood to
pour more cash down the hole.

The boom in Mt. Isa is having a stimulat-
ing effect on other silver-lead interests. A
prospectus of the Boro Silver-Lead Develop-
ment Co. is among those which are tempt-
ing the public. The property is near Tarago,
about 160 miles from Sydney. The docu-
ment states that 170 acres are being acquired
on a field discovered and worked during the
silver boom of 1888. Shafts have been sunk
to 283 feet and sulphide ore tapped. At the
200 ft. level a crosscut for 106 ft. was in lode
formation, and no hanging wall was reached.
About the centre of this body the first sul-
phides wore seen, and a small 6cwt. sample
at Cockle Creek gave 570 z. silver, 26 p.c.
lead and 36 p.c. zinc, the return being £5 3s.
2d. a ton net, with lead at £l4 17s. 6d. a ton
and silver at 2s. an ounce, zinc not being
paid for. At 275 ft. water stopped opera-
tions. The new co. proposes to unwater and
continue the crosscut at the 275 ft., when
the fate of Boro silver-lead will be settled—
until the next time.

The output of the Bowen coalfield (Q.)
jumped from 11,806 tons in 1922 to 91.643
tons in 1923. Only two mines are operating,
the Bowen Consolidated and the State Col-
liery. The output of the former is small yet,
and at present the co. is sinking a straight
shaft to get the Bowen seam at 350 ft. Prac-
tically the whole of the increase of 80,000
tons has come from the State Colliery, where
manager Jim Conway has had the run of the
State Treasury to equip the mine. Its out-
put has risen to 400 tons a day.
As anticipated, Herberton tinfield (N.Q.)
had a good month in March. The output
was worth £12,626, of which £10,890 came
from lode tin. The Wild Irishman had a
rich crushing—96 tons for 11 tons of con-
centrates worth £2OOO. The low-grade mines,
the Arbouin and You and Me (Dereks Co.),
had outputs worth £2240 and £1875 respec-
tively ; then there was a big drop, the Boun-
dary coming next with £530. Dereks are
just completing their 20-head mill, and if
tin keeps anywhere near its present level the
co. will hold its own with larger crushings.
The March tonnage of 760 tons averaged 495.
* •* * *
Brookfield Eclipse (Q.) is raising further
capital for development work. The supposed
new reef turns out to be a cross-course to
the old reef, carrying some vein quartz. It
has been driven through on the level and the
old reef is faulted away. The latter is look-
ing well right along the top level. The co.
intends to sink and open up the reef by
driving in the vicinity of 100 ft. This will
give a good tonnage of backs for crushing.
Geologist C. C. Morton has recently made
a survey of the mine and recommends further
work.

A syndicate of 40 £lO shares has been
formed in Cairns by sharebroker Arthur
Clarke to sample and take up areas on the
Palmer River (N.Q.). The Palmer pro-
duced more than £6,000,000 of gold, and at
one time 35,000 Chinese were at work. The
new syndicate is setting out to learn whether
the field carries pay values which could not
be won by the primitive methods of the old
hands. The big trouble on the Palmer as
a dredging proposition has been the rock
bars; the syndicate just formed proposes
to employ the excavator type of plants in
place of dredges. Operations are in the
hands of C. H. Wray, and should he report
favorably a larger co. will be formed.

Mackay district (N.Q.), where several
unsuccessful attempts have been made to
start a coal-mining industry, particularly at
Hampden, has come to light with an Bft.
seam. The find was made by William
Macartney at St. Helen’s Creek, about three
miles from the North Coast railway. Sev-
eral other outcrops of coal occur, but have
not yet been tested. In the Bft. seam there
are lOin. of bands, leaving 7ft. 2in. of clean
coal. It is the best find yet made in the
district, and the chances are that the seam
can be traced practically on to the railway
line, and in that case it should be a valuable
proposition. Where opened up the seam is
in rather unsettled country.

The Speck’s osmiridium diggings, are
rather sick at present; the current price of
£29 per ounce is not sufficiently attractive
to induce the men to face the hard condi-
tions of life on the field. Since the begin-
ning of the year an open market has pre-
vailed for the metal, and prices have shown
a marked improvement. Very little virgin
ground now remains for the diggers. The
hope for the future is in the deep ground
around the Savage River flats, where modern
power-plants will be required to handle
ground carrying only grains per yard.

Australia has sent a sample of mica to
New York, and it has been pronounced good,
and worth between 30s. and 40s. per lb., which
is more than 3001 b. of wheat fetches just
now. The deposit is near Alice Springs, in
the cool south end of the N. Territory
(Alice sits nearly 2000 ft. in air), and.it is
large and well known. But the railway
still stops 468 miles short of the little moun-
tain town, and stays there, notwithstanding
that a whole Queensland bullock is worth
about lib. of best Alice Springs mica just at
present.
* * * *
The eight dollars per lb. realised in
N’York for Northern Territory mica should
encourage the development of the deposits
at Mica Creek, near Mount Isa field
(N.Q.). Reports are tmanimous that the
occurrence there is of importance—quality
good and the flakes of marketable size.
Several leases have been taken up, but only
shallow prospecting has been done. The
mica occurs in large pegmatite lodes.

On the advice of lI.S. geologist Brown,
the plant of the Kotuku Oil Co (M.L.) is
to be sold up and the co. disbanded. The
geologist states that, though oil is present
in the field, it is not in commercial quanti-
ties. A large amount of money has been
spent on boring in the district during the
past 20 years, and its stringing-on propen-
sities relieved the Royal Dutch Co. of
£50,000.

In all 26 538.000 tons were treated on the
Rand last year for nearly 9,000,000 ounces,
worth about 40 millions, the biggest figures
ever recorded. The average grade of ore treated
was just a shade over 6-Jdwt., while costs
worked out at £1 per ton. If some fussy
Australian gold mining cos. grumbled less
about high wages bills and other “burdens”
and made efforts to reduce overhead charges,
modernise treatment plants, concentrate hold-
ings and consolidate operations, they, too,
would effect much needed savings and show
better results.

“O.B.”: Since Mararoa left Norseman and
a quantity of gold in its old mine, its luck
has been out; and, despite official optimism
respecting present interests, I can’t see any
sign of luck returning. The co. reckons it
has a good prospect on the Emu blocks at
Reedy’s and something attractive at Wiluna;
but the work of trying to find a payable
mine in the former locality and of exploring
for extensions of the main ore-channel in the
latter will prove costly. And, of course, there
is no certainty of success.

The Anglo-Persian Oil Co. balance-sheet
runs into big figures. Authorised capital,
nearly all issued, is £20,000,000; debentures,
about £5,000,000: reserves, £5,000,000:
profit and loss account, £3.000,000. Out of
a total expenditure of £30,000,000 of a capi-
tal nature during the past three years by the
Anglo-Persian Co. and its subsidiaries,
only £12,000,000 has been provided by new
capital issues, £12,000,000 having been met
out of earnings and £0,000,000 out of funds
in hand. Output of crude petroleum for
1924 is estimated at 4,500,000 tons. The
Newport (Vic.) refinery, owned conjointly
by the Commonwealth Government and the
Anglo-Persian Co., ought to start refining
Persian crude oil this month.

WIMBLE'S INKS"
"Lex" contrasts two murderers: —
Angus Murray, of Victoria, has gone and Williams
of Is . S. Wales, is going. It suggests the inadequacy
of a flat rate of punishment for murder. There was
a religio-ethical basis to Williams’s crime. If nis
curious principles had only permitted him to com-
plete the job and cut his own throat, after dis-
posing of his children, he would have inspired the
same sentiments of pity, not unmixed with admira-
tion, that were recently accorded Wade, the suicide-
murderer of Edgeclift (Sydney). As it is he has
almost certainly done the. State a good turn :n
relieving it of the liability represented by three
children with what the doctors call “an exceptionally
bad family history.” The Jukes family, which lias
already cost the U.S.A. millions of dollars and is
still going strong, came of just such stock- M s.
Williams is in an asylum, and Williams has a form
of religious mania. The murder of his children
appears to have been Williams’s only crime.
Murray, on the other hand, was a con-

darling!”
genital and habitual criminal. He had been
qualifying for the extreme penalty all his adult
life. The man he killed was a useful citizen, and
the object of the murder was sordid gain. It was
suggested that because some doubt existed as to
Murray’s having actually done the deed (though
there was none as to his having been present on
business when it was done) he should be shown
mercy. This is contrary to reason as well as law.
If Murray didn't do the slaying it was only, one may
be sure, because his friend got in before him. In
Sydney 20 years ago Grand and Jones were both,
hanged for a murder which only one could have
actually committed. Williams is, of course, beUer
dead, and he welcomes the hangman’s attentions
under the impression that the drop will transfer
him to Paradise, whereas Murray went with the
reluctance of a healthy Pagan, albeit with the
bravado so often displayed by his kind. Nevertheless,
many will feel that there should be some distinction
between the methods employed in despatching the
two outlaws. Williams deserves some form of eutha-
nasia if ever an assassin did.

“Sierra”: No explosions marked the de-
scent of the cruiser Australia to the depths.
Her silent exit was due to the thorough way
in which all enclosed spaces in the vessel
had been opened up to allow of the tree
egress of air. The explosive noise of imprisoned
air bursting up decks and bulkheads m sink-
ing vessels is, as a rule, erroneously ascribed
to the bursting of boilers. The Liverpoo
Salvage Association a few years ago placed
it on record that in all of the scores o
sunken ships examined by its officers the
boilers were found intact.^
“Yarrum” • How’s this for the humors of
trial by jury? At No. 1 Criminal Court
last week two lads, Blank (19) and Dash
(17) were charged with breaking and
entering. The jury found both guilty, and
added a recommendation to mercy m tbe
case of Blank on account of his youth.
On the records of the pair being read, prior
to the passing of sentence, it transpired
that Blank had 32 previous convictions.
’S’Onali thereupon suggested that the jury
might like to re-eonsider its verdict, ihe
good men and true retired, and after con-
sideration withdrew the recommendation to
mercy from Blank and extended it to Dash.

“Skipper” : I know a man who was con-
victed by court-martial for deserting from,
the base to the front line. An old “regular
sergeant, on arriving back in England he
got a job as drill-instructor in the training
camp, arid his C.O. wouldn’t part with him.
Repeated applications to be allowed to pro-
ceed overseas were turned down, nor..did his
string of ribbons protect him from the covert
insults of the reinforcements passing through
the depot. One dark night he dropped a
man out of the draft for France and quietly
took his place. The substitution being dis-
covered, he was returned to England uncici
escort. A district Court-martial found him
guilty of desertion —it had no choice—-and
reduced his seniority by six months: but it
attached a strong recommendation that his
wish to be actively employed against the
Ring’s enemies be gratified. Authority was
somewhat peeved—-I know, because I was
a member of the unhappy Court—but the
recommendation was acted upon.

“Bloggs” : The Hood is reputed to be the
best-disciplined ship in the British Isavy.
Yet the standard in some particulars is well
below that of the maligned old A.I.F. lhe
tars’ disorderly ramble through Sydney on
the day the squadron arrived would have
shamed the humblest Digger n.c.o. if it had
been perpetrated by his brigade after the
first year of warfare. About one man in
every three was out of step as they passed
my vantage-point (the T. and G. Building-
in Elizabeth-street) ; they were all talking
and waving to the girls, and only the offi-
cers maintained anything like tfie attitude
expected of men on a ceremonial march.
The finest spectacle in the marching line
that I saw in three years’ service was a
battalion or thereabouts of the Scots .Guards
passing through Dickebusch on their way
(I believe) to Passchendaele in 1917. the
men had their packs up, and had come from
somewhere well behind Ea Clytte, yet they
swung through the apology for a town
which was Dickebusch “at attention, not
an eye turned to right or left, and with
the eloek-iike precision they would have dis-
played in P'all Mall. The next most inspir-

ing sight in the disciplinary line was offered
by an Australian battalion on the Amiens-
Bapaume road. It was the summer of 1918,
and they also were “moving up.” 1 hen-
sleeves were rolled back over their powerful
brown arms, and their necks were bare.
But for this it might have been imagined
that they were on parade. They passed
through Querrian like a machine, not a man
out of step, and with never a sign of slack-
ness or fatigue. The physique of the sail-
ors was almost as disappointing as tlieir
marching. Far more attractive to an ex-
soldier’s eye were the Marines —but, then,
they class themselves not far behind the
Household troops.

“F.A.” : When the tears over the scuttled
Australia have ceased to flow there are one
or two other craft that may be held to merit
at least a sigh. The sea-bed somewhere
north of Capricorn holds the remains of a
submarine and her entire company. I his
disaster took place during the din of recruit-
ing and overseas war news, which is perhaps
why no memorial has ever been suggested.
There was another craft of like structure
which met her fate upon an extremely
hazardous excursion in the Dardanelles, and
she, too, disappeared without ceremony or
funeral orations. Both of these vessels were
partly manned by Australians, and both
were actively engaged in the business of
war; and they both surely merit an epitaph.

“Spare Corp”: It looks at last as if Syd-
ney’s old Victoria Barracks are doomed:
new administrative headquarters will be
erected out Strathfield way. Paddington’s
eagerness to get rid of the buildings and
cover the space they occupy with rateable
private houses is base ingratitude. ihe
suburb grew around the barracks, living
mainly on “the sojers” ; when the Imperial
troops were withdrawn in 1870 and it was
proposed to close the barracks and accom-
modate the garrison artillery in the vicinity
of the coast forts, Paddington raised an
effective howl of protest. The Barracks
were erected in 1840, and British troops ot
that era grumbled about being sent ‘out
into the country.” For many years the
Easter volunteer encampment was held
alongside—Sydney Sports Ground now
covers the area. Higher up, on land now
included in the Agricultural Ground, was
the rifle range, with a rocky hill at the
end to stop the bullets. This was super-
seded by the Kandwick range, which is now

“Hathern”: I remember a highly-placed
officer in the Australian Navy giving a din-
ner to some friends at a fashionable Sydney
hotel. Being a
somewhat frugal
soul, he had a case
of champagne sent
along to the scene
of festivity, as he
thought the hotel
charge for “bub-
bly” too high. The
licensee’s eye froze
visibly as it fell on
the case. The head
waiter was called,
and received his
instructions. After
the dinner the host
got his bill, and
was horrified to
find an item: “To
corkage—l2 bot-
tles at 10s. —£6.”
The officer paid;
and he doesn't
bring his own wine
when he entertains
nowadays.
“Heredot”: Blast-
ing operations were
lately carried out
in a Sydney sub-
urb close to _ a
house in which
there were some
old and highly-
prized oil-paint-
ings. One morning,
after a number of
unusually heavy
shots, it was seen
that a good deal of
the paint oil one
of the pictures had
fallen off, and when
somebody pulled it
down to have a
close look at it,
the rest of the
paint ca m e off.
Other of the works
soon began to be
affected, all that
was left of one
small canvas being
part of its back-
ground. Expert
opinion was to the
effect that the vi-
brations caused by
the explosions had resulted in the paint
being dislodged. The owner is talking about
legal proceedings, but those responsible for
the blasting refuse to accept any liability,
and contend that there must have been some-
thing w 7 rong with the paint.

“Hamer” : The gallow r s in B hall at Long
Bay, w 7 hicli is claimed to be the most com-
fortable of its kind in the world, has been
used only twice, the kindly intentions of its
constructors having been largely frustrated
by a Labor Government, which didn t be-
lieve in capital punishment at all. The two
men accommodated there were Benzing, the
ravisher of a girl at Rockdale, and W ilson,
the I.WAV. slayer of a George-street restau-
rant-keeper. The “scaffold” is a partitioned

keeping them in position is withdrawn —
and there you are! The posts underneath
are heavily padded to deaden the fall of the

GOODBYE, SUMMER!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a keener tang - in the morning airs—
Summer is done ! Summer is done !
Stalls are laden with grapes and pears,
And each robbed bough in the orchard wears
Splashes of gold on its dusty green —
Gold where the red of the fruit has been.
Summer is done!
The nests are empty, the beaches lone —
Summer is done, over and done!
The plunging surf has a deeper tone,
And far the showering spray is blown,
Like stinging tears by the wild wind shed
For the azure beauty of hours fled.
Summer is done!
Fold up the shrunken and sea-bleached gown —
Summer is done! Summer is done!
The arms and shoulders so richly brown'-
Will pale ’neath furs in the. rain-swept town.
For now, like the. throb of an old refrain . ...
That comes and falters and comes again,
These words through the web of the morning run:
“The glory of summer is past and done!”

ARDATH TOBACCO COLTD.. LONDON.
“Ike Hollar”: A battle has been fought
and won by the hatless brigade in a
Government Department in Sydney. It
is a couple of years since , one of the clerks
decided to forswear headgear, and join the
lidless legion. His action was regarded with
an eye of cold disapproval by several
of his superiors; he was even car-
peted. Subsequently a “staff instruc-
tion” was issued notifying that whilst
it is not desired to interfere with the per-
sonal liberty of those who have adopted the
idea of dispensing with hats, it is deemed
necessary to point out that the absence of a
hat on his peg is inclined to create uncer-
tainty as to whether an officer is in or out.’
This roundabout remonstrance producing no
effect on the delinquent, some direct friction
followed; and finally a departmental head
first asked and then ordered the offender to
wear a hat. The obduracy continuing, the

self.”

officer had him suspended for refusing a
reasonable request from his superior. That
started a long battle of minutes and eounter-
mirnSs. which has resulted in the tyrant’s
knuckles being rapped by a still higher

On the day the verdict became known
’cilf a dozen other clerks threw their lids

verts to the new fashion as that the chance
of safely annoying an unpopular head is too
good to be missed.

“D.”: If Melbourne’s faith in the infalli-

the events that led up. to the execution of
Angus Murray, the city is one of the most
credulous in the world. On the •Ith inst.

the Argus said that 5000 had assembled in
the Exhibition Building the previous night
to protest against the sentence; the Herald
of the same date put it at 10,000 and the
Sun at 34,000. The Herald said that
50,000 people had signed the reprieve peti-
tion ; the Sun of the same evening an-
nounced that “over 120,000 had signed, _and
the list is far from complete.” The feUN
observed on the fatal 14th that a thousand
people knelt on the roadway in front of the
gaol and prayed when the hollow, mourn-
ful sound of the prison bell announced the
passing of Angus Murray’s soul.” The Herald
of the same hour was saying: “No sign was
given from the gaol that the execution had
taken place. Neither was the gaol bell
tolled. The striking of 10, which was the
signal for the crowd to pray, came from a
clock on a near-by building.” A week more
of it and half Melbourne would have doubted
if there ever had been such a person as
Angus Murray.

“Hasen”: One Caret Garrett, in recent
issues of the Saturday Evening Tost,
writes a series of articles setting out to be
a justification of, but rapidly declining into
an apology for, the American Mercantile
Marine. My experience of American cargo-
vessels entering Australian ports convinces
me that they need an apology. I keep a
vivid mind-picture of the recent departure
of one of them. Tug, pilot, agent, Customs,
quarantine officials and the sailing hour were
all present, but half the crew, including
captain and chief engineer, were
not. The Old Man appeared
a good half-hour late, but a
quarter of the crew still
missing. “Look here, cap’n”—
this from an engineer still hot
from argument with the first
officer and some mutinous fire-
men —“whose jahb is it to mus-
ter the crew on this crahft?”
“Why,” the cook’s,” snarled the Old
Man; “whoseja think?” An hour later
she pulled out and disappeared down the
river like an unpleasant slattern slipping
away into the merciful night.

“Macquarie Street” analyses a pass-list: —
There are several interesting facts to be got from
an analysis of this year’s pass list of the Medical
School in Melbourne. The most important is that,
out of an imposing list of 171 final-year candidates,
only 67 have passed —roughly but 40 per cent. One
would imagine that, after the rough seas of the
previous yearly exams, had been safely weathered,
it would be comparatively easy for the bulk of the
students to make port with flying colors, especially
as most of them have had the advantages of the
clinical school of the Melbourne Hospital, which is
second to none. Yet of the 132 from this school
only 52 passed. The debacle will surrly t ni to cool
the enthusiasm of parents bent on putting their sons
into this generally ill-rewarded and unsatisfactory
profession.
Another fact which affords food for reflection is
the slump in women graduates, only five out of tne
67 belonging to le beau sexe. Lately the air has
been full of complaints from women doctors that
the outlook for them in practice is exceedingly poor,
and that all the decent honorary appointments in the
big hospitals are snapped up by the devouring
male. There is much truth in these statements, and
the lot of the woman doctor is at present pretty
hard. A woman graduate, if she passes high, may
obtain a resident position for a year; after that
she has to leave, unless one of the senior posts
resident pathologist, microbiologist, etc. —becomes
vacant; and if this is obtained it means lingering
on at a poor screw. There do not seem to be many
openings for women in general practice. I hardly
ever hear of them entering practice in the country,
and they are rare even in the suburbs. They seem
doomed to spend their lives in resident jobs, or in
Education Department appointments. I don’t see
why they should not aspire to become consultants
in some of the easy specialties, such as psychiatry,
diseases of the skin or diseases of children. There
are others, too, which are suitable to their tempera-
ment, such as gynecology and obstetrics, and in-
ternal medicine (organo-therapy, etc.). Also there
is nothing in the B.M.A. rules to prevent them
starting out-pati' nts’ clinics in any specialty they
may choose. Something of the kind has been
attempted in Sydney, and such a scheme seems to
me to have unlimited possibilities.

“L. Roe”: There was a queer run of cir-
cumstances attending the death of 70-
year-old John Matheson at Mount Gambler
VS.A.) the other day. The old man went
to fish in the Valley Lake, Mt. Gambler’s
big volcanic pool. A boy saw him on a
ledge, hardly accessible to a goat, over 90ft.
of water, with line out and heels apparently
dug in, and enviously wondered how the
veteran got there. Thirty-six hours later the
same youth saw the lone fisherman in the
same place and attitude, and casually re-
marked, “Gripes, the old boy’s there yet! ’
An hour later another fishing party saw the
aged angler's body floating towards them.
Medical verdict: Heart failure 30 hours be-
fore the fall. Popular conjecture: A big perch
took the hook and pulled the lifeless body off
the ledge.

“T.R.IL”: “Astor” (B. 10/4,/’24) says
Angus Murray was “not guilty of the
savagery of the red-headed crook who did
his best to kill Geoffrey Syme in a cele,-
brated encounter at Ivew some years ago.
I happened to see and talk with this “savage
red-headed crook” when he was temporarily
in Melbourne gaol hospital less than 18
months ago. Actually he is a physical weed
and, according to the medical register, was
never anything else. According to his own
story (he has already done a life sentence
for the Syme affair) he was a mere lad when
he made "a burglarious entry, armed with a
revolver, into Syme’s house. He was so
inexperienced a crook that he was going up-
stairs with his boots on when the noise
awoke Syme, who came out of his bedroom
and engaged the intruder. The scared lad
did not fire his gun. but it went off in the
course of the thrashing he got, and damaged
some plaster several yards away. My
acquaintance mentioned that many petitions
for his release have been sent in, but an avail-
ingly. “Syme himself won’t stand tor
release,” he added. “He thinks I’d try tor
revenge. And all I should want to do would
be to get away from Melbourne as quick 1\
as I could.” I have nothing to say about
Murray; comparisons—even among crooks—
are odious. #
“Machete”: A long run of consistent bad
luck may or may not have terminated the
other day when the Yankee four-masted
barque Muscoota was bought by a Sydney
coal co. for a hulk. For over a year she has
been lying in Double Bay. Built m Liver-
pool, she was christened in 1888—by no less
a personage than Queen Victoria, who had
gone to the city to open the 1888 exhibition
—with the name of Buckingham. She sailed
on her first voyage on a Friday; and it was
not long before a mutiny and the murder
of her master began her hoodoo career. II
was hard to get crews for her; so she was
sold and her name changed to Ottawa, lne
next bad luck the boat experienced was to
become a German vessel. But the Huns pre-
sently lost her to the Yanks, and after her
name had been changed to Muscoota she was
arrested at Newcastle (N.S.W.) for debt.
A local firm bought her and sent her to the
TJ.S.A. for timber; returning, she collided
with a steamer off Wilson’s Promontory-
After that she stayed in Double Bay tilt
the finish —if it is finished. So much tor
Buckingham! # #
“S.T.S.” on scientific manslaughter
If we must have gunmen in this country they may
as well do the thing properly. The revolver will
presently be declared an illegal possession, I hope;
for it is difficult to see how there can he any object
in carrying it other than a possible shooting of a
fellow man or woman or oneself. However, while
we carry it, let us follow the rules as laid down by
the great masters. In walking or standing, your
right hand is conveniently near to your right hip,
and you “draw” from there, firing as you come up.
Experts like to “throw down on” the object, first
raising the hand above the head and firing as it
comes down level ; but that applies only when you
have plenty of time. But seated, and with your
hands on the table busy with cards or a tumbler,
it is a long way back to the hip, and no distance
to the left armpit. Having a gun concealed there,
be careful, whenever trouble threatens, to edge you'
left shoulder well forward. Thus, instead of drawing
and aiming separately, you “cover” your man across
the table even as you draw. If these simple rules
are observed, a pleasant —or, at any rate, successful
—evening at the card-table is assured,

Maryhs cheek has lost its rose,
Tears have stained her face ;
Relatives in Sunday clothes.
Bustling round the place,
Look at her with meaning eyes-
Well they know her “shame"’ —
Plainly saying: “You are wise;
Take the chance and scandal dies.
Give the kid a name!”
Oh, she was so obdurate,
moping week by week,
Would not, in reproach or hate,
Of her lover speak;
Sobbing o’er a crushed romance,
Shielded him from blame.
“Lord, she led us such a dance!
Now she’s got her lucky chance —
Gives the kid a name!”
Perkins, crabbed and sixty-two,
Claims her for his bride,
Swelling in the people’s view
With his pious pride.
Merit he must surely win
Thus to cloak her shame:
Saves her from the fruits of sin,
Takes the poor and troubled in—
Gives the kid a name!
Perkins, in his outward air,
Conscious virtue shows.
In his heart, of pity bare,
He his bargain knows:
He will take her, young and bent,
Humbled by her shame —
Take the drudge the Fates have sent,
Beaten by the argument
“Give the kid a name!”
Mary’s cheek has lost its rose,
Life seems blasted, bare.
Only in her dark eyes shows
Anguish and despair.
Well does she, too, know the price—
Drudgery and shame.
But she goes, with heart of ice,
To the ghoulish Sacrifice,
Gives the kid a name!

he will put himself there, and, between sit-
tings. build up the legal business at Castle-
maine which be has been neglecting.
The number of Diggers in S. Aus. Parlia-
ment has been doubled by the recent elec-
tions. Denny. Hudd and McMillan were all
re-elected, and Collihs, McHugh and Shep-
herd sent to join them.
_ Passed out at 98 in the Old Colonists’
Home, North Fitzroy, Peter Boldini, one of
Vic.’s viticultural pioneers. Born in Swit-
zerland. he came to Australia in the early
flays of the gold rush, did a bit of digging,
then tried to start a match-factory, and
finally took to wine-making. He produced
some of the first wine exported from Vic.,
and won several medals in France and Swit-
zerland for his vintages. Eight years ago
the old chap steered for the harbor of the
Old Colonists’ Home.
“Zanthus* : Prime Minister Bruce, in his
speech of welcome to Admiral Field at
Sydney, repeated the old, old stuff about
Captain Cook and Australia. Isn’t it time
to recognise that Australia’s debt to
Matthew Flanders is far greater than to
N.S.W. Premier's secretary, CLIFFORD
HAY, one of the chief organisers of the
Fleet festivities.
Cook. The latter charted the east coast
-W,Australia in a sketchy fashion, and only
did it because he thought his vessel wasn’t
egual to important work. Though he re-
turned twice to Maoriland he never troubled
to look at Australia again. Tflinders spent
some ot the best years of his life exploring
and charting the Australian coast. Ilis
charts of the Recherche Archipelago, the
Bight and parts of the Gulf of Carpentaria
are still the best we have. Though he was
not the first to use the name Australia he
helped to get it accepted. He and his com-
panion in his earlier explorations, George
Bass, certainly took a lot more interest in
Australia than ever Cook did. Cook, in
fact, took not an atom more than circum-
stances compelled him to.
George A. Bond, the stocking man, has
produced the first made-in-Australia “Turk-
ish” towels—from good Australian cotton
yarn, too. This represents the first attempt
at cotton weaving in the Commonwealth.
Born in America of an English father and
Scotch mother, Bond landed in Sydney 17
years ago with no assets outside the rare
combination of an old head on young shoul-
ders and plenty of gameness. To-day he
controls the _ largest hosiery factory in
the Empire. His aid to the new cotton indus-
try should be invaluable, and it looks as if
this country one day will owe him a large
monument.

Once the publicans of Newcastle (N.S.W.)
got up a ball, and as a joke they sent a
double ticket to Methodist parson Fred Col-
well. As Mrs. Colwell had no wish to go,
the minister roped in Mrs. Courtney Smith,
a well-known temperance w'orker, . and
accepted the invitation on condition that the
pair should be allowed to address the dancers.
This was conceded, and during an interval
the addresses were duly given, both visitors
being accorded a hearty round of applause.
The religious papers said that the parson
should not have attended the ball, but Col-
well declared' he would go again if invited.
But he has had his last chance, for he had
a funeral the other day.
Queensland's vile climate has had another
advertisement. After police-magistrating at
Ingham, Rockhampton. Warwick, South
Brisbane and other places, Philip Walter
Pears has been gathered, in by the Reaper
at a youthful 78. But it took a bicycle acci-
dent to do it.
“Pantagruel” : Charlie Seymour, a pioneer
of unionism in Bananaland, ; has gone over
the ridge. He left the sea to become sec. of
the Seamen’s Union in Brisbane, and soon
bulked large in Labor matters. The first
manifesto of the Q. Labor party was drafted
by him, and he attended the first Inter-
colonial Trades and Labor Congress in Bris-
bane in 1888, the Trades Union Congress in
Hobart a year later, and the Maritime Strike
Committee meetings in 1890. Seymour bran-
dished a fairly facile pen, was in turn re-
porter, sub-editor and editor of the Worker,
and lately had been editor of the State Gov-
ernment’s Insurance Journal,
N.S.W. Justice James, who has been a
little over three years on the Bench, put
up a record for a modern Judge at the last
criminal sittings in Sydney—he passed no
less than five death sentences. The verdict
of the jury left him no option in any case.
Dr. Billy Maloney, M.ILR., is about to
attain three-score years and ten, and to
mark the achievement some of his Melbourne
friends are giving him a smoke night at Mel-
bourne Town Hall on May 8. Parentheti-
cally, the Little Doctor is another reminder
that men of 70 are not nearly as old as they
used to be when the Psalmist gave that age
as their limit.
Charlie North, who won the Claremont
seat m the recent W.A. elections, derives his
political ambitions from his uncle, the late
Bigjohn Forrest. North contested the 1914
I ederal elections, but, despite valuable avun-
cular assistance, was numbered among the
also-rans. He served as a captain with the
air force during the war, and on his return
to Australia settled in Fremantle to chase
Costs, He now has a large practice, and
recently was elected Mayor of Cottesloe,
W.A.’s watering place.
The Neotsfield (N.S.W.) homestead block
and buildings, 236 f acres, have been sold by
It. H. Dangar to J. F. Knodler, of Glendon-
brook, at £45 per acre—£lo,6s4. The
original Henry Dangar came from St. Neot’s,
Cornwall, about 1821, and got employment
as a surveyor on the Hunter. In 1826 he
obtained a grant of 700 acres, the nucleus- of
the large estate subsequently acquired, and
it has remained in the family's hands ever
since.
The death of T. W. Cosh, of Wedderburn.
removes one more early Vic. mining identity.
A member of the Maryborough Mining Board
for most of his life, Cosh up till the last
had great faith in the Korong district, and
wormed several grants from the Government
to try to revive the dying industry. Thomas
Sullivan, the Maungatipu bushranger, one-’
worked an alluvial claim alongside Cosh, but
forsook it for what looked like bettor returns
on the “road.” A Chinaman then made
enough out of it in a fortnight to take him
back to the Flowery Land.
John Bighell, who went out at 84 ijU&ris-
bane recently, is said to have conceived ihe
idea that led to the discovery of artesian
water in Australia. An old Melbourne
Grafnmar boy, he went jackerooing in W.
Queensland at 18, later on bought Dillalab
one of the State stations —and then
selected Widgeegoaro. A typical bushman,
standing 6ft. 4in. in his socks, Bignell was
a crack shot, and the niggers of the old days
stood in awe of him ; yet he fed and doctored
half the Warrego tribe in bad times.
“The Deacon”: The new Seamen’s Home,
opened by Archbisli. Kelly in Kent-street,
Sydney, for the visiting R.C. Jack Tar, has
as its chaplain one of Australia’s outstand-
ing R.C. padres. The history of the Rocks
for the past half-century winds round Peter
Piquet, the volatile little French Marist, at
present in charge of St. Patrick’s, on Church
Hill. Not an inch of the Rocks is unknown
to him, and the diminutive cleric is every-
where regarded as a sort of mixed reincarna-
tion of the Cure of Ars and St. Vincent
de Paul.
Bill Irons, the just-dead sec. of the Syd-
ney Bricklayers’ Union, used in the early
days, with the sanction of his union, to talk
to pressmen about the ability of the Austra-
lian bricklayer to beat the world, and to pro-
test against the importation of men likely to
lower the standard. The change of policy
in later days must have hurt him. Iron's
was no speaker. Mostly he was silent; but
one evening, during a discussion in the Syd-
ney Labor Council, he jumped to liis feet as
each orator sat down. At last he caught
the chairman’s eye and poured out his
bottled-up effort of oratory. “Mr. Chairman,
Im opposed to the motion. It’s rotten!”
he said; and flopped down again.
“Ike Hollar”: Another parson to throw up
the struggle to keep going on an inadequate
salary, and suppress his feelings regarding
the mixed hypocrisies he has to meet daily,
is Allen Stevely, who, after a brilliant ’Var-
sity career, in which he won his M.A, before
r *is 21, has labored in the vineyard for
16 years. He has bought a news-agency
in Fitzro.y. All sorts of callings beckon the
clergyman who has given the church best;
but: perhaps the most injeongruous is book-
makers clerk. When a Presbyterian par-
son had a clash with his elders, a bookie of
his suburb, believing he had not been treated
fairly, offered him a job with the pencil. He
was surprised when the offer was accepted.
"I can now open with prayer, like they do
I arliament,” was the bookie’s jocular boast.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” looks back:—
I was present in the old Banco Court, Sydney on
November 19, 1873, when James Martin, Q.C., was
sworn in as Chief Justice of N. S. Wales. ’ The
Judges on the Bench were Hargrave, Cheeke and
Fawcett, with Deffell, Commissioner of the Bank-
ruptcy Court, and A. T. Holroyd,; Master in Equity;
and 26 barristers were present. Of all of them
F. E. Rogers and G; H.; Fitzhardinge, both retired
I).C. Judges, are the only survivors; the former
was “called” in 1864 and the latter in 1866. Of
the barristers who were present two, Salomons and
Barley, became Chief Justices ; seven others —Innas
W. M. Manning, Henry Stephen, W. C. Windeyer’
Wm. Owen, C. J. Manning and H. E. Cohen—were
destined to be Supreme; Court Judges; three-—Wil-
kinson, Rogers and Fitzhardinge—D.C. ’ Judges • and
one, Edmund Barton, a High Court Justice.’ On
being sworn in Martin went to Darlinghurst and

moved from Brisbane to a somnolent sea-

a tidal creek that blocked the spread of
settlement from a neighboring well-populated
subbub, and he said so. The idea startled
the rustics, who promptly elected him to
the local council.

“Fordson”: The quaintest accident I know
of happened in the Mackay (Q.) district about 18
years ago. A Chinese with an iron tank on his cart
pulled up as usual under a big molasses vat, and
had turned on the tap to fill his receptacle when
his horse moved on. Taken by surprise, Pong
grabbed and hung on to the big tap, and in no
time there was a 6in. stream of molasses running
JUST A SMALL PRECAUTION.

over him from head to foot. The weight of it
eventually made the poor, half-suffocated devil let
go his hold, and he hit the ground fairly heavily.
He fought to get clear, but it was no use; the
heavy, sticky mass held him firmly, and he was
almost' done for before the astonished onlookers
could free him from his comically tragic position.
“Wee Bobbie”: “Bouragi” is right about
there being a burrowing jungle-fowl in the Solomons
(B. 18/ 3/’24). It is the megapode, a three-toed
bird of the quail species, about as big as a red-bill
or jacana. To kill them is taboo among the natives
—they are preserved for egg-production. I have
seen on the small island of Savo a patch of sand
shaded by some straggling softwoods literally covered
with the birds. They rush hither and thither about
their business, excited and squawking as though they
hadn’t a moment to live. Their holes resemble
rabbit burrows, and they rush down them kicking
sand behind them like a potato digger. They take
less notice of the natives moving among them than
white leghorns would in a barnyard. Their eggs are
pink and longer, though no thicker, than a duck egg.
They bury them several feet in the soft sand. A
strange feature about the young is that they can
fly as soon as they are clear of the shell. On the
island mentioned each house has its own claim
pegged out in the egg mine, and there are never any
rows about claims being jumped. Incidentally, the
Solomon Islander is not partial to eggs unless there
are birds in them.
* * •* *
“Keystring”: Up till last summer I was
prepared to accept the old kookaburra and the
common magpie as the champion snake-killers in
the bird line; but a pair of nesting brown hawks
in my paddock (North Coast, N.S.W.) seem more
jusily entitled to the distinction. I saw these birds
take over 20 snakes, ranging to 3ft., up to their
home during the last three months of ’23. And I
don’t suppose old Jackie did the killing for them.
Asa snake-banisher I’m afraid the lovable old
Aussie is inferior to St. Patrick. But has any
of the Council had similar experience regarding
hawks ?
“X.Y.”: I saw a fine instance of animal
friendship in Charleville (Q.) a few years ago. H.
Carter, of Carters, Ltd., had a big brown retriever
who, as his boss’s firm was housed at that time in
Fitzwalter’s Buildings, chummed up with a fine
large tom-cat belonging to that store, and the pair
became the greatest of pals. Rain following a long
drought brought the Warrego down in flood over-
night, and next morning the water had risen above
the bank opposite Charleville, and was almost into
the town as well. A crowd had collected to watch
the water rushing over the bridge, when it was
seen that Pitzwalter’s eat was marooned on a stump
on the opposite side of the river. Much sympathy
was being expressed for Thomas when Carter’s dog
arrived on the scene with his boss. The old chap
took the situation in at a glance, and, plunging
into the flood, swam to the stump on which the
cat was nearly awash, seized him tenderly by the
scruff of the neck, and brought him safely back to
their usual quarters.

“Amapu”: To train horses to be' easily
caught tnis is as good a way as any. Double a
length of rope, and near the doubled end tie a
knot so as to form a rough crupper. Put the crupper
where it belongs, pass the two free ends of the
rope over the withers, bring them down one on
each side and knot them together cn the horse’s
chest. Then get out in front with the two ends
of the rope in your hand and call the prad, giving
the rope a tug at the same time. He’ll soon come
forward. When he stops call him again, and give
the rope another pull. In this way a horse can very
socn be taught to come at a call or a whistle. He
can also be taught not to pull back by tying the
two ends of the rope to a rail. Every time he pulls
back he hurts himself; and he soon gets rid of the
back-pedalling habit.

“Tinkan”: This digging up of greased-
lightning blade-shearers reminds me. When Stumpy
was ringer at Burnima, a back country “gun,” Wild
Rorty, got a pen there. The speed of this rep.
was broadcasted around, mostly by himself, and
Stumpy was duly
elected to take him
on. As the bell went,
both grabbed a sheep,
and Stumpy going for
his life, niver looked
up till his animal, as
pretty as paint, started
down the .’hoot. Then
he glancru at Rorty
and saw him with the
belly-weal off his
second sheep. Stumpy
gritted his teeth,
grabbed another woolly
and simply flew over
it. As he slid it down
to its mate another
glance apprised him
that Rorty was going
over the shoulder of
his third sheep. Poor
old Stumpy gasped,
looked around help-
lessly at the grinning
shearers and said:
“Well, boys, he’s too
blrnky good for me!”
Then someone yelled,
“Look down his shoot,
Stumpy!” Stumpy did.
There were no sheep
there. Wild Rorty had
been shearing the one sheep all the time. '

There passed away in Wagin
district (W.A.) recently a cow that must have been
about the world’s record long-milker. She came .o
my farm in 1914 with a flow of milk that had
continued uninterruptedly for the previous four years;
she carried on the good work right through the
war, and was still keeping Nestle’s from the door
when death overtook her.
“Wessel”; Some weird information about
Australia and other places was sprung cn the world
by Ralph Stock in his last year’s book, “The
Cruise of the Dream Ship.” On a trip up the
Queensland coast he travelled with a “sunbaked
pastoralist” who, at a recent muster of cattle, had
tallied up 500,000 head and then had not finished
l fancy the Commissioner of Taxation would like his
address. The description of life at Thursday Island
is a joy. Stock batched with two lads of the village
who moved in the best society, and this is how they
laid in the meat supplies. Rising in turn before
dawn they stole forth into the iron-bound forest of
the settlement (whatever that is) and offered the
most appetising looking kid (four-legged) in sight
a lump of sugar with one hand, seized its hind leg
with the other and smothered its cries with a towel.
Half an hour later it had been converted over the
stove into something that looked like shoe-leather
and tasted like kerosene. As to diving records,
Stock knocks those quoted by R. H. Davis in his
ALL IN A GOOD CAUSE.

“.Timmy P'ossum”: That whitish specimen
which “Centre” shot in Queensland (B. 2l)/3/’24)
was probably a large scrub bat and not a, flying-fox
(fruit bat). When scrub-felling on the Bananaland
coast in 1902 I came across a similar specimen,
which at the time I thought was a young white
flying-fox; but I subsequently learnt that it was an
adult example of a distinct variety of the bat
family. I was fool enough to grab him with my
naked hand, and before 1 knew what had happened
he had bitten me in several places, drawing blood
with each bite.

“Veedee H.”: Narrow shaves? At a Glad-
stone (M.L.) sawmill the other day a young man
stumbled and fell oackwards against the revolving
breaking-down saw. He was tossed about 10 yards
over a small pile of timber and landed on a heap of
sawdust. They took him to hospital for repairs with
an 18-inch wound in the thigh region, and he is now
doing well. Only that he was carrying a big
knife in his hip-pocket, the whizzing saw must have
slashed him straight through to the backbone. The
knife took the first shock and was cut clean in halves..
* * * *
“Cobba-Cobba”: I don’t feel inclined to
argue about how or when or why malaria fever came
to New Guinea,, but I know that, after 17 years’
absence from the place, 1 still get my issue. A cut
finger or any other injury is the signal for a dose
of the bone raeker ; a stiff dose of quinine, a glass of
hot spirits and some good thick blankets are the most
effective remedies. My first attack came when I had
been on Murua six weeks, a mere school kid. My dad,
who was in all the early gold rushes on the main-
land and with the first batch on Woodlark Island,
was singularly free from malaria while he remained
in New Guinea. But from the day he landed m
Queensland till he got away again he was never
free from it. Incidentally, he went under to swamp
fever on the Solomon Islands. I have known boys
recruited from distant islands suffer with a slight
form of malaria, while local nigs were absolutely
immune to it.
* * * *
“FY7”: Who told “H.8.E.” (B. 3/4/’24)
that the soldrer crab is useless for bait ? In More-
ton Bay, at Southport, Bribie Island and elsewhere in
Southern Queensland he is considered one of the
finest baits going for whiting and flathead, the former
especially. The soldier won’t last long on the hook,
but hungry whiting, coming in on the early flood,
don’t linger over their meals.
*.* * *
“Pat Bushie”: Re “Borom’s” friend who
drags a decomposing liquid mess as a trail for foses
(B. 3/4/’24). Six years ago, while I was in the
Warrumbungle Range (N.S.W.), my friend roped
several skinned rabbits together by the legs and
hung them in a shed for a week, at the end of which
Period, the weather being hot, they were mutely
eloquent. My friend then tied the over-ripe cotton-
tails to the back of a sulky, harnessed up Mont-
morency and set out to drag them round the pad-
docks, dropping overboard at intervals a strychnined
bait which he buried with the aid of a shear-blade
attached to a stick, leaning over the back of the
sulky to do it. Next morning the bag consisted
of four foxes and one eaglehawk, all for nine baits.
* * • *
“F.A.”: Savage horses? I struck a man-
eater a few years back on Gunbar station (N.S.W.).
I was nosing about the stockyard, in which there were
half a dozen nondescript prads, of which I was
taking’ very little
notice. Suddenly 1
heard rushing hoots
behind, and turned to
see a mouse-colored
colt preparing to lift
a slice off the rear of
my carcase. I made a
swipe at him with my
hand, but he continued
his attack, and I had to
back ' away, fighting,
for safety. He ended
by getting a few square
inches of shirt as 1
mounted the rails.
When I told the over-
seer he laughed and
said it was “only
playfulness.” To prove
this he went to the

charged him with flat-
tened ears and open
mouth, and each time
he made a snap his
teeth came together
with a disconcerting
click—each time but
once, and then he
muffled the click with
a piece of warm over-
seer. The brute had
been turned out in a
b’hk paddock since it
had been gelded, and
had now been run in to
see his worth. The boss
himself went along to
have a look at him
when the overseer s

yard a couple of times, a Winchester was requisi-
tioned and a mouse-colored hors chide was in the
store a few hours later. [ ■
“Pick”: The Councillors who have been
writing up their measurements of long maize stalks
have evidently never explored the N.S.W. South
Coast. Corn does grow there. At the Tilba Tilba
1910 show, Tom Southam, of Couria Creek, won
first prize for longest green stalk of maize with an
exhibit that reached an inch ,or two over 22ft.
And on the Kanowna Flats a crop was once grown
over a large field that regularly reached over 19ft.
The growers down that way, too, always cut the
tassels off their crops when the cobs commence to
form.
“Paul C.”: Can any Abo. naturalist

mere are trips we make for pleasure
And long voyages of toil
While the engines chant a measure
As they swing in steam and oil;
But the song that never changes
Is the song the pistons lead
As the night mails breast the ranges
At their utmost roaring speed.
“Oh, the miles that lie before us
Must be conquered ere we rest”™
Loud they shout and stamp their chotus
On the rails that climb before us
To the bush-clad mountain crest.
As she tears past swaying wattle
There are steady eyes that watch,
And a calm hand on the throttle
As. it opens, notch by notch.
Where the lanky bridges quiver
There’s a light touch on the “air,”
And she roars across the river
With a turn of speed to spare.
Oh, the townships, darkly sleeping,
Stir to see the night-inails go,
With their shining side-rods sweeping
And their eager pilots leaping
And their furnaces" aglow.
When you’re safely in your sleeper
And the carriage-lights are dimmed,
Then your driver is your keeper,
In his cab, a shadow limned
By the lights the smoke half smothers
Burning out through clinkered bars—
Ah! the miles and.he are brothers
Of the lonely bush and stars!
With his sparring mate beside him
Through a rocking world he reels,
And the distances deride him
As they lead him on and hide him
With the time-god at his heels.

the white ant is certainly affected by changes in the
weather, but to say it is possible to tell the direction
and the intensity of approaching rain by the location
of the timber ravager’s architectural additions is
sheer nonsense. The termite enlarges- its domicile

on another, continuing the process till the build-

“ J.F.” : In tin article on brush turkeys in
the Sydney Daily Telegraph (24/11/’23) by someone
writing from the Northern Rivers (N.S.W.) there
appeared the following: “In making their nests they
generally sought the densest part of the scrub, and
would scratch all the leaves in it for 50yds. or more
all round, till they built up a mound 7ft. high, and
40ft. in circumference at the ground. .. .When laying
an egg the hen would select a spot 2ft. from the
ground. Perhaps a dozen or more hens might lay
their eggs in the one nest....as many as 70 eggs
have been taken out of one nest.” Amazing figures
these. Fifty yards all round would mean about 1£
acre, and this raked clean of leaves, etc. (brush
turkeys are no slovens), with the inseparable volume
of soil for generating heat, would build many such
nests as that indicated. Again, these birds don’t
select the densest part of the scrub for nesting, any
more than open parts; they don’t go back 50yds. for

“I thought the dog was going for me; hut his hark is worse than

“Yes; he only just barks, and then father wakes and conies out with

building material; they don’t select a spot 2ft. from
the ground to lay their eggs; and they don’t build
a nest 7ft. high in any part of N.S.W, —except,
apparently, the Northern Rivers. As to the numbers
of eggs taken from one nest, I leave that open. No
bushman knows everything, but most of us know
something, and my own first-hand observations would
indicate an average of seven or eight eggs, and gener-
ally one hen one nest. I have never seen more than
two birds at work.
“C. Coral”: Anthropologists recently an-
nounced that there is a connection between the
Torres Strait islanders and the Egyptians of the
fifth dynasty. The argument is based on the prac-
tice of mummifying- the dead
which the islanders used to go in
for until the white man arrived.
The process was a long one. The
internal organs were carefully re-
moved and the cavity was filled
with nipa palm and other things.
For removing the brain an arrow
was used. The body was attache !
to a bamboo framework called a
“paier,” was painted, and was
frequently kept in the house for
a year, so that instead of his
photograph the widow had the
deceased himself! Some of these
mummified bodies were taken from
Darnley and Stephens islands by
various expeditions, and are now
in museums. But it seems to ire
to be rather a fragile link to con-
nect Egypt and Torres Strait. On
the same lines I have pretty good
evidence that the Strait’s native is
a descendant of the Jews—the cus-
tom of marking the face ani
placing ashes upon the head in
time of mourning is quite Hebraic.
Then, again, I have been assured
that the islander has much in com-
mon with the Gaelic peoples ; and
if one takes the language as a
test, with its mixture of Malay,
Spanish and other “outside” worls,
the result is different again. So
far as traditions are concerned, the
islander can fit you out with
bucketsful. Naturally many of
these must have historical bases,
but the unravelling process has so
far not proceeded a great way. The Cambridge
Anthropological Expedition’s reports give most of
what has been done up to date.

“C. Coral”: A pearl-nautilus shell was
washed up on a beach on Yorke Peninsula (S.A.) a
little time back, with portion of the dead animal
that it belonged to still inside. As this particular
variety comes from the South Seas and Torres
ttrait it must have travelled a mighty long way.
The pearl nautilus has a white shell with red stripes
which polishes up like mother-o’-pearl. It belongs
to the octopus family, like the squid, and attaches
itself to its handsome abode by two of its 90 arms.
It may be seen sometimes, though not very often,
up here in Torres Strait, travelling along, roof-
down, on top of the water, using its house as a boat;
and it is altogether too swift and elusive for the
fastest dinghy to pursue, so the boys tell me.
When it scents danger it takes a dive below, like a
sea-snake. It is said to possess no suckers or ink-
bag, and so evidently relies on its armored “tank”
for protection. The specimens that float in on
to the beaches here are always minus their tenants,
dead or alive.
“AdeL”: In from
the northern coast
of Australia there
are stretches o f
turpentine- and
quinine-scrub table-
lands, waterless in dry
times but snewy and
almost bottomless in
the rainy .season. After
a week of continuous
rain in these forsaken
lands, countless springs
form rivulets, which
run from a few yards
to hundreds, ana then
sink in the morass, to
spring again somewhere
else. These soakages
and all surface waters
dry up within a fort-
night after rain has
ceased ; yet in the little
rivulets there are thou-
sands of small fish,
seemingly all of one
kind, but varying in
size from one to four
inches in length and up
to 4oz. in weight, and
having no resemblance
to any seen in perma-
nent waters. Moreover,
these highland streams
have no surface con-
nection with the nearest
perennial waters, which
in places are 50 miles
away. Whence do these
fish come ? From
subterranean basins or
where ?
Mick Murphy has his say:—
Now that Bill Carson has spoken (B. 13/3/’24),
let me enter for the Bulletin Enthusiast Stakes. X
have beta a reader from the first issue and am still
going strona- At one time I had a collection of 15
years, some of them bound. They are now in the
Bulletin office, having replaced those burnt in the
fire. I did not start to collect again till quite
recently, and have by me all issues of the last four
years, with the two columns of the Red Page pasted
inside opposite the continuation of same, so as to
lose noth.in the binding. I was at the meeting
in the old Masonic Hall in York-street to welcome
Haynes and Archibald on their release from the
debtors’ prison at Darlinghurst, whither they had gone
over the Clontarf libel action, and it was there that
I first heard that game journalist and writer of the
article, the late W. H. Traill, who subsequently did
so much in placing The Bulletin in the unique
positicn it holds to-day. Bill Carson says his last
desire will be a shroud of the latest issue; but when
I go west I want to carry a Bulletin agency
with me.
“FY7” : “Hayseed” (B. S/4/’24) is wrong
in saying that snake venom is deadly “only to any-
thing that has warm blood.’’ One wriggler can
poison another, though that other must be of a
different species, their own brew being quite harm-
less to members of the one family. If, say, a rattle-
sndce bites a cobra, or vice versa, the bitten one
takes the knock. Both Calmette, the famous French
herpetologist, and Dittmars, of America, have pointed
this out. They seem to have stumbled on the discovery
by trying to keep different species of snake together
in one cage. At the same time reptilian powers of
resistance to snake venom are greater, apparently,
than those of higher animals.

“Larry Longun” : There is a native plum
growing in the brigalow scrubs of S. Queensland
which would be an acquisition to the country could
it be produced in marketable quantities. I don’t
know its scientific handle, but it grow's on a vine
with a feathery, fern-like, prickly leaf, is about
the size of a large prune, and, when fully ripe, is
blue-black. The pulp, in which a few small, dark-
colored seeds are embedded, is milky-white, and the
flavor delicious. It has an attractive white flower
with numerous thread-like petals, and the vine
appears to be of slow- growth. It favors hilly and
rocky country, and a large vine bears perhaps a
couple of dozen of the fruit. I never met with
this plum elsewhere than in the inland scrubs of
South Batianaland, and it did not appear to be over-
plentiful there.

Zanthus” : Shepherds do not watch their
flocks by night—nor by day either—in Australia
since fences came into fashion in the sheep
countiy; but the old-fashioned shepherding is
practised in one bit of the continent. One
Watscn (not Christopher) has gone in for
sheep out on the Nullarbor Plain, near the Forrest
station (East-West line), and as there are no fences
and the country is afflicted with dingoes, he employs
the local abos. to shepherd his flocks. They are
inn l ? Very n ' ee L v ’ too. There is a run of about
100,000 square miles—more or less, for no one
knows the exact limits of saltbush and bluebush on
tlie Nullarbor. The bores put down by the railway
people show good stock water at varying depths
right along the line except at the extreme eastern
end of the plain, where it is a bit too salt. With
water and fences the big flat stretch would be good,
safe sheep-country carrying 30 or 40 to the mile.
\\ .B. ; Recent references to islanders
signalling with drums recall that the Maori in the
old days also used this mode of' communicating between
distant points. He fashioned his drum thus. With
ins stone axe he hewed a sft. length of matai (choosing
this wood for its superior sonority), from 15in. to
I jiii. in diameter, and, carefully splitting the log
down the centre, hollowed the two halves smooth and

shell, he trimmed the edges to a near-fit, then wetted
and dusted them with coarse grit-sand, and replacing
the two halves rubbed them together till he had
ground the edges into a perfect, air-tight fit. He
smoked the wood till it was dry, gave it a good
anointing with oil, and then at Sin. from each end
he firmly bound together the two halves with a broad
sinnet band. This completed the instrument, which
Hori suspended between two posts and roofed over
to protect it from the weather. The open-ended barrel
for such it really was—was beaten with a matai
waddy., This wireless outfit the Maori called a
“pahu” (each syllable accented, short!. The drum-
beats were a sort of shorthand, which the practised
hearer would translate into complete sentences. A
preliminary series of “Hello!” beats drew attention
to the call. To keep the messages secret, each tribe
had its private code of beats. The amount of infor-
mation thus conveyed astonished the early pakeha.

“Adamascus”: A resident of Gracemere
(C.Q.) has a pet female ’possum which periodically
leaves home for the bush and returns in a few
weeks with a youngster. Each time she goes out
the previous little one is taken with her and left
in the bush, where it has to scratch around for
itself. The old lady came home a little time back
with her fifth.

Africa ejected its poison by spitting it into the eyes
of its enemy', and also that it could accurately “shoe/.”
a man 10yds. away. In a recent issue of an Englisii
nature-study periodical there is a description of an
incident at the London Zoo, in which a keeper in the
snake-house was permanently blinded by a ringhals
snake discharging a quantity of venom into his eyes
at a distance of nearly 40ft. The account states that
these snakes will eject the contents of their venom-
glands in this way on the slightest provocation, and
that, in consequence, the keepers have been forbidden
to go near their cages unless wearing spectacles.

‘“Allan D.” About two years ago, at the
dad’s place on the Manning River (N.S.W.), a hair-
less calf was bom. Except for the entire absence
of bristles it seemed quite normal. The season being-
summer, we decided to rug it to protect the delicate
pink skin from the sun; but this didn’t save it—
no hair made its appearance, the skin peeled and
the flesh cracked, and after seven weeks of torture
the calf succumbed. Now in a letter from home
I learn that another hairless unfortunate has strayed
into the world.
OF COURSE HE REMEMBERED.
“Here! Have you forgotten that you owe
me ten quid?”
“No! Didn’t you see me trying to hide as

“Mepliisto”: Generally a bolting neddy
is stopped by a John Hop or some other brave
person grabbing the reins. I’ve seen it done another
way. A man of my acquaintance tied his horse
and sulky to the country-pub verandah. He was
five houses further on when the excitement began.
As he stepped through the fence he noticed a long
piece of hardwood in the roadway. Dobbin got it
cn the head. They used four buckets of water in
bringing him round.
THE DANCE OF THE WHIRLWINDS.
[FOR THE BULLETN.]
nesting, I lie where a great tree shelters
My humble camp with its peaceful shade,
While ofi the plain when the noonday swelters
The whirlwinds dance in a grand parade.
1 doze and dream or I wait and listen
To hear the boom of an emu’s drum;
'The dark-green leaves of the gum-trees glisten
As onward the waltzing whirlwinds come.
Onward and upward, their wild course shaping,
As courtly women with heads held high,
Swaddled in billows of gauzy draping
That swish and swirl as they’re passing by;
Red as the east with a wild day breaking,
Or grey as eve when the clouds hang low,
Through the glaring haze, till my eyes are aching,
I watch them come and I see them go.
Through belts of brigalow swiftly sweeping,
Spreading the leaves like a silver sheet,
By the restless dunes where the sand is creeping,
They leave the print of their whirling feet.
On the western rim they are gaily curling,
Clutching the shrubs in a mad embrace,
IV ith flowing (v n I ns in their wake unfurling
They cross t“e pans where the heat waves race.
With hidden smiles on their deep-veiled faces
They swing to their partners or circle wide;
Ihe leaders pause till they choose their places
As the drought wind swells like a rising tide.
Closer and closer and all together
They take their cue from the wind’s hot breath—
The wind that is stalking through fiery weather,
Setting the tune of the dance of death.
Feathers and dead leaves interlacing,
Their unbound tresses they w r ave and fling ;
Withering grasses their contours tracing,
The laces trail and the flounces cling.
Shimmering garments are floating lightly,
Rising and falling with ne’er a sound;
Silt-sand gleams as the sun shines brightly—
A sequin fringe where the robe is bound.
The gum-trees bow to the bulloaks sighing;
The ground is spread with their fallen leaves.
The sands of the river are hot and drying,
And the whirlwinds dance while the great bush
grieves;
W here blade and root on the plain are dying,
And the sun’s rays cut like a surgeon’s lance,
The bleaching bones of the stock are lying,
And faster the crazy whirlwinds dance.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
ROGER
&
GALLET
Perfumes

Powders
The A.J.C. Autumn Meeting opened on
Saturday in a blaze of sunshine. Under a
speckless sky 80,000 punters perspired over
a Randwick which for once did not even
hear the rustle of a breeze. Woman was the
sufferer, having been beguiled by the serpent
of Style, who had tempted her, saying: “It
is time you threw off your summer pose of
being the bare sex. Make Adam go out
into his jungle of the Stock Exchange or
the Shipping World, and shoot you a pelt
and a gross of plumes, or put forth upon the
Ocean of Beer, and hook you a woolly
garment, for the cold days are at hand."
Poor darlings, in silhouette swathes and
turban headgear, the latter flying plumage
that varied from the thyroided ostrich to
something that resembled a lush growth of
lucerne, moved between tote and stand, still
smiling, although the heat of fox and skunk
wraps must have been unbearable. The
woman in lightweight frocking, conscious of
a fur checked in the cloakroom, was the
wise virgin. There were several hundreds
of her in georgettes and marocain, shady as
to hat and armed with variegated sunshades.
Tall hats of the male were on many female
heads, and the official stand bloomed with
several pairs of spats—one impressive gent,
pearl-grey frock coat, silk hat and a very
correct cane, made a passage through the
scrum at the back of the stands that was
nothing short of a sultan’s progress through
abashed slaves.
Both the G.-G. and State Exes, were
present. The vice-regal pens were dressed
in pastel tints, Lady Forster safety-pinning
her faith to leaf-brown frocking, from which
floated the fashionable cape; her headpiece
was a cigar-brown velvet toque flying a game
chanticleer’s tailpiece. Daughter Mrs. Pitt
Rivers was in lilac silk, crowned with a hat
of the same hue wreathed about with blue.
I aidy Helena Rous stuck to mauve tints;
her Countess mother was clothed in tailorings
of sand color, topped by blue-and-silver mil-
linery. Sir Dudley’s lady faced her first
race meeting swathed in the green of anew
Spring leaf and a black hat gay with foliage.
Ailsa Cullen was another who favored the
cape effect—she was a crown-to-heel sym-
phony in brown. Janet and Barbara Knox
wore designing-looking millinery; Mrs.
Otway Falkiner and some Baillieus were
among the Melbourne visitors; Dame Alice
Chisholm had a day-out in navy; Mrs. Tony
Hordern wore a hat dripping with plumes,
above henna and cinnamon georgette; Mrs.
Geoffrey Hughes was smart in black and
white; Mrs. Alec Hay’s georgette frocking
had the merest suggestion of the waistline of
other days, and was finished with a hat
heavy with shaded plumes. Judge Rolin’s
lady was a handsome demonstration of
autumn’s russet, and the belle of the official
stand was pretty Barbara Bowker, in ivory
frocking and a wide satin hat under which
the family eyes and hair shone with the
effect of a Florentine painting.
The sun, being a perfect gentleman, was
covered with confusion at the reproaches
hurled at him over his Saturday’s ardor, and
didn’t put in an appearance at Randwick on
Monday. A leaf-brown army of fur coats
and winter suits possessed the land of hope,
ho brown is this winter’s atmosphere some
Martian is probably reporting that an un-
usual breed of locust is abroad on the Earth.
It isn’t a universally kind shade either, and,
plus the inverted-bowl headpiece adopted by
every second woman, palls when grouped bv
the thousand. The G.-G.’s lady flung the
benediction of example to the brown sister-
hood, and was otherwise cosy with furs; our
own Goveniinent House lady wore the luxurV
of blue velvet in her coat and skirt, and
kept it warm with a few fox pelts. The
Countess Stradbroke snuggled in an em-
broidered race coat of fawn cloth, and again
hoist blue millinery. Mrs. Pitt Rivers, Miss
Phillimore and Lady Helena Rous were
others who blew in and out of the vice-regal
pews; and Mrs. Grant was another bright
spot in the gathering. Edna Armytage (Mel-
bourne) showed the latest craze of New
York in the Ohiiiese embroideries on her
coat: and among the welter of befurred and
small-hatted women were Mrs. Jim Gordon
and Mrs. Russell Clarke of Melbourne.
Horse and ox, sheep and pig, melon and
apple, butter and cheese, wool and wheat—
what fabled Argosy ever brought to Tyre so
golden a harvest as this of the Northern Rivers
and lush southland? As ever, the Easter
Show is pre-eminently the proud moment of
the man on the land; but of course town
cousin comes along to have a look, and maybe
see if there is a place for his finger in the
pie. On the day of the official opening vice-
royalty and officialdom encouraged Primary
Production from the special stand, and after-
wards refreshed itself. Peltry and plumes
were the distinguishing feature of the dress-
ing of this group. The Governor’s lady
sported a beautiful model in georgette of
sand tones, heavily beaded; and nut-brown
millinery and furs completed the outfit. Lady
Stradbroke came up to Melbourne reports
of her glad-raggery—-her brown-corded silk
coat and blue-and-silver headpiece were a
mannequin’s dream. With her was daughter
Lady Hel. na Rous. Prime Minister Bruce
and his lady and the Earle Page pair were
others to sip the official brew.
Mayor Gilpin’s ball opened the second
week of the Fleet revels, and did it on the
handsome scale: 4000 of Sydney’s Who’s
Who got mn eyeful of gratification even if
there was no floorage to swing an active
jazz-hoof. There ought to have been a traffic
cop to regulate the jazz band, and any one
with a curly kick at turnings should have
been disqualified. Nothing like the welter
of civic luminaries has been seen since Mayor
Richards’s party to celebrate peace and wel-
come Admiral Jellieoe. There was no longer
anything bleak about the Town Hall: it had
been transformed into an enormous summer-
house in. autumn tones of gold and yellow.
The outline of the galleries had disappeared,
and white lattices twined about with rose-
vmes thick with creamy blooms gave a look
or romance to the lost or strayed Dulcineas
who peered through their softness at the
crowd below. The light filtered through big
golden roses, while kilometres of rosebuds
clinging to their vines were laced into a
canopy overhead. Off the main thoroughfare
were trellised byways designed for Corydon
and Phyllis, but occupied most of the night
by Fat and Fifty.
The ball on the Hood on Thursday night
was the last word in exclusiveness; in fact,
a doubt as to whether the Press should pro-
fane it was only resolved at the last moment.
Gay with red-and-white awnings, and daz-
zling with electrics, the decks had the color
and movement of. an Oscar Asche production,
velvets and. satins, brocades and jewels
caught the light as the groups moved in the
dance or between dances sought the sitting-
out places enumerated loudly on the pro-
gramme^—-and those others that are found
by intuition. The sailor-men were perfect
hosts. The ship’s officers lined up to receive
the guests, and afterwards saw to it that
they danced if they wanted to, or with un-
failing good nature displayed still again the
wonders of their. floating community. In the
wardroom there is one treasure that has the
aura of a sacramental vessel, so loudly does
it proclaim that all is vanity—it is the solid
silver punchbowl presented by him who was
Czar of all the Russias to the old Hood. A
striking bit of decoration was a gilded laurel-
wreath with the name of Nelson piercing its
corner—some thick-skinned women had uti-
lised it as a wrap-hanger.
The Government House party arrived in a
special pinnace about 9 o’clock and were
received by Vice-Admiral Field. With the
Excellencies came Lady Stradbroke and
Chief Justice Cullen’s lady. Lady de Chair
sparkled with crystal opalescence over ivory
satin and flew Brussels lace as a shoulder
drape and side train; she wore a diamond
band in her hair and diamond fringe ear-
rings. The Countess Stradbroke finished off
peacock-green frocking with a wisp of silver
cloud for a scarf, and illuminated it with
diamonds; Lady Helena Rous was a paste!
in blue and silver, and Mrs. Pitt Rivers
sheathed herself in gold tissue. Gwen Fuller
wore her presentation frock of silver brocade
topped by a coat of blue velvet, and tied
her head together with a silver band that
thrust out blue antennal: Mrs. Pat Levy, in
black heavy with embossings of red-and-gold
velvet, was an eye-arrester; geranium-red and
gold enfolded the pretty Woolf girl; Rita
Lackland s Lorelei frock was in the fore-
front of the shorter-skirt movement, and fair
Margaret Osborne was one of the most
attractive girls on board.
~ ! j lO . Tony Horderns’ gorgeous dance at
Retford Hall dashed with the affair given
Qte + T he Hordern entertainment
attracted the senior S.S.S. officers, the Gov
eminent. House division, and most of the
wealth if not all the beauty of the city. Mrs.
1 itt Livers, the Pat Osbornes (she is Mrs
and dearest friend), the Ken
H K Ar ai ii ' scs ’ Je Claude Parburys and a crowd
ot Melbourne visitors were there.
Ihe R.A.N. party featured, amongst
others, all the prominent members of the
military set. Our soldiers and ex-soldiers
entertaill the squadron them-
wel fJi?. <H e , WaS fixed and things were
? y h !i U a , meßH ®«e came from
Melbourne that the show had been can-
lion? Olnh aV< m 0f °-? e P™ ffered by the Mil-
iions Club-—the, sailors thought there was
Million ff° r ? mpire ' b ? os ting amongst the
M ll oners than in a service environment. So
the warriors bore no malice and brought their
belongings to the Ambassadors in vast num-
bers. Captain Craufurd and his lady did
the honors, she in the shimmer of pewter
satin that creseendoed to a Lenten-like drape
of violet. Graceful Mrs. Feakes accom-
panied her sailor, trailing draperies sugges-
tive of a ripening apricot. Mrs. Brand
bloomed like a primrose; and Mrs. Ireland’s
Bacchante beauty was intensified by vine-
green frockiug heavy with gold beads. It
was a young things’ night out, and every one
of them flew her best chiffonery.
The paper-chase, though organised by that
hard-riding sportsman, Brig.-Geueral C'ox-
Taylor, was more a social event than any-
thing else. About 150 turned out and
a score of them were sailors on bor-
rowed horses. The fiction that naval men
can’t ride has often been disproved here (a
naval De Crespigny was one of the best
amateur riders N. S. Wales has known, while
the Dr. Shepherd above mentioned was an
R.N. surgeon) ; and our visitors, with one
or two exceptions, did it again. The most
impressive figure on the field was General
Bertie Lloyd, in “pink.” The least attrac-
tive were some of the girls in breeches and
boots.
Other times other playthings. When a
former squadron, with Royalty aboard, came
this way, some of the officers, including the
present King and his elder brother, were
entertained at Namima station, Wellington,
where the late J. Aarons arranged a kan-
garoo hunt. There was no battue, and the
’roos were come across in the ordinary way,
but a big bag was the result of such a day’s
outing as “I don’t suppose we shall ever have
again,” the present King remarked at din-
ner. There is a trophy of that day still in
the xlarons family—a small huntsman’s horn,
left by Prince George as a memento.
The Waacs and the Wrens and the Wrafs
engineered one of the week’s successes at
Sargent’s ballroom in Market-street. Here
100 petty-officers and men were the guests
of the evening. Dr. Marjorie Little did the
honors, backed by Olive Kelso King and Dr.
Mary Booth, while Mrs. Lyster Ormsby and
Anita Onslow lent a cheery smile. There
wasn’t much helping-hand needed. Jack
helped himself to a partner and the music
did the rest.
The Military Tattoo at Victoria Barracks
was reserved till the evening before Good
Friday, and it proved a sight as thrilling
as. unusual. The barrack-square was as
bright as day with electrics and flare torches;
on all sides it was hemmed with onlookers,
from State Governors and Admirals, and
Apollos like Brig.-General Bertie Lloyd,
down to the friends of the friends of the
color-sergeant. In the background the old-
fashioned architecture of the officers’ quar-
ters, reminiscent of the military buildings in
Hongkong, developed an atmosphere not
theirs by day. Within the lighted square
men swung gun-carriages with a miracle of
ease and precision. Bands massed, poured
out their music, dispersed and massed again,
till the sounds bursting within cornet and
trombone and drum of 10 fully-manned bands
split the ear of night. Then came the mar-
vellous leg show of the week, when the
horses of the mounted police, stepping
daintily as any Genee or Pavlova, tripped
through the Lancers, side-stepped wufi a
coquetry almost vampish, and altogether
showed an appreciation, of rhythm that
leaves the ordinary eurhythmic class among
the also-rans.

State Ministers at Parliament House on
Saturday—was owned by J. C. Rolpli, who
has been mayor of San Francisco for 14
years and most other things between times.
You can tell Iris strong suit by his title—
“Glad-hand Jimmy.” He has welcomed
2,654,000 people to his City of the West ;
and every man (and woman) of them has
been told of the wonders of the place. A
great “booster” is “Glad-hand Jimmy,” a
typical product of California and a shipping
man in his spare time. .
The jolly Cheer-o girls were thoughtful,
as usual. On the night of the Mayor’s Ball
at which every one of them might have
been a guest—eight of the clever amateurs,
under the direction of Mrs. Bennett White,
went across to the Hood and put on an
entertainment for the benefit of the petty
officers and men. Judging by the cheers
heard from the Kirribilli and Neutral Bay
pontoons, the concert was another sparkling
Cheer-o success.
Jill (Lydia Tempest), only bud of the
Justice Rich couple, turned her back on the
Naval gaieties, and went in for the serious
business of a life-partnership with Ashley
Hooper, of Melbourne, last week. The Rev-
erend Garnsey played the role of Cupid’s lock-
smith, and his workshop w r as the Chapel of
St. Paul’s College in the Uni. —Ashley is
just through medicine. Jill, supported by
father’s arm, made the passage to the altar
in rich silver brocade that drew a train of
old family lace —that had been worn by Jill’s
mother and grandmother as a wedding veil;
Jill’s was of plain tulle, kept in position by the
usual buds and a band of silver. Cousin Phyllis
Rolin, in primrose georgettes, ’maided; and
Frank Richardson (Melbourne) was best
man. The Rose Bay Golf Club housed a
reception that topped the second century in
attendance, and included many of Sydney’s
best wigs and their womenkind. The ’groom
has something of a war record: he was an
artillery captain with an M.C. and a men-
tion.
This is Ernest Watt. One of the direc-
tors of the old shipping firm of Gilchrist,
Watt and Co.,
he yet finds
time to write
(he has pub-
lished a trans-
lation of Pros-
per Merrimee
and several
books of
verses) ; to act
(he has fig-
ured in lead-
ing r6les in
many of the
Repertory
Theatre pro-
ductions) ; to
boost Austra-
lian art, con-
duct a crema-
tion campaign,
own race
horses, and
live a busy
social life.
The mysterious Cavalier Club, of which he
was one of the founders, meets at his quaint
Edgecliff house, where the ballroom is over
the garage, and the dining-room 50ft. below
the street level. His wife, who was Bertha
Brady, is in England, and he leaves to join
her there at the end of the month.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Fleet Week and the boys of the bulldog' breed ma le
night and day hilarious. New Mayor Barry and the
council had a big garden party in New Farm park,
and at night the warships—the light cruiser section
of the squadron—made stairways to the stars with
their searchlights, while officers and men sat in
corners with Brisbane’s prettiest, or danced here
and there in a city alert to give them a good time.
The Matrons’ Ball filled the Trocadero, the Hillcoat-
lent their house for a party, and the Brisbane Club
had an at-home. Sir Matthew Nathan, fresh from
his trip south, and looking much better for it, was
at most of the functions. He arrived at the ball
with the Rear-Adminil, Mrs. and Miss Bogerson,
Lieut.-Col. Durrant and Captain Turner, and was
received by the committee, which included the J. T.
Bell, Cecil Palmer and J. M. Thomson matrons and
other of Brisbane’s smartest set. His Ex. had come
on from the Club, where President Isaacs and his
better half received, she in black brocade gorgeously
broidered with Egyptian work. Mrs. Lazarus, from
the Sydneyside, wore blue with a silver over-dress, and
the pretty Grose girls were there in ivory satin and
pale blue marocain. Dr. Robert Thompson’s pictur-
esque wife was in old rose chiffon velvet with rosettes,
and Clover Thompson wore cherry color.
Mrs. Cain gave a dance tea at Lennon’s to help the
Country Women’s Assoc, along. Edith and Minty
Barry danced an eighteenth-century duet, and about
300 guests applauded.
Sir Matthew gave a “men only” luncheon at
Government House on the 16th. In addition to a
big detachment of navy and army heavyweights, the
new Mayor of Brisbane (Aid. Barry), Judge Shand,
A. J. Thynne, Dr. Glyn Connolly and H. C. Cripple-
attacked the turkey.
In the evening Sir Matthew' went to the Yacht
Club Ball at the Trocadero w T ith Sir Hubert Brand,
the Rogersons and Lieut.-Col. Durrant. The hand of
welcome was extended by James Love and Major
Swain. Many naval officers joined the- giddy throng,
including Princess Pat’s husband and the Dauntless’s
commander, Wilmot Smith.
On the morning of the 17th the Fleet was
captured for a civic reception on the south side,
whereat the Mayor and Mayoress told it how glad
they were to see it, and more than half South
Brisbane assembled to back them up.
That evening there was an at-home on the
Danae and Dunedin, which are illuminating the
surroundings of Birt’s Wharf, and “Rule Britannia”
is the fashionable tune of the moment.

Chatter
The Occidental
Collins St. Melbourne
The merry-go-round of fox-trot and jazz
has run down, leaving a deadly dulness.
But things are bound to speed up again be-
fore any of us has time to acquire the home
habit —or disease, as some moderns seem to
think it. The vice-regal Forsters hauled
down the Government House bunting to
cross to Sydney and Brisbane, and State
Governor Stradbroke took his boys to
Macedon for Easter w r eek, while his cheery
Countess and daughter Helena plunged into
the Sydney race-season frivols.
Grand opera is the one thrill offering—
and quite an expensive thrill, too. Few, how-
ever, are bold enough to admit to not having
heard Melba, or the Dal Monte warble. Dis-
cussion as to the merits of the rival tenors
is fast and furious. Unfortunately the
ci'itics do not see eye to eye in this matter,
so there is no one to decide the vexed ques-
tion. The row of Federal Government House
front-circle seats is now filled in with the
guinea public, and even the Stradbroke allot-
ment has been temporarily given over to the
booking office. Never before has Melbourne
seen such well-dressed audiences; but the
preponderance of boiled shirts makes one
wonder if our men are more musical or
merely more self-indulgent, than the skirted
sex. The flapper is conspicuously absent ;
a continuous diet of jazz is hardly calculated
to put music into her young soul.
“Otello” has been a Melba triumph from
more than a purely vocal viewpoint. All
the Very Best have mustered to see her
through. The diva’s dressing of Desdemona
is a masterpiece of strategy. In the first act
she recaptures some of her lost girlishness
with a fair wig and flowing draperies of
mauve, light as thistledown, and washed
with crimson on the inner surfaces, while a
golden diadem binds her flowing veil to her
brow. Her second robe, blue as a Streeton
sky, is inset with jewels and weighted at
the foot-line with silver bands, and a bluer
veil streams from a silvery anchorage. Then
gorgeous hangings of ivory and gold precede
a ravishing nightie of shimmering white
crepe. This is cloaked with violet and
ermine before the smothering conclusion.
The “Barber of Seville” made his debut
on the 16th, when, for the first time in the
present opera records, “God Save” did not
prelude the orchestral opening. No vice-
regals being present, there was no excuse for
turning it on. Melba held up the eye-
traffic in a pen hedged in with vegetation,
which was afterwards hurtled to the feet of
Dal Monte. Prince Obolensky and übiqui-
tous Tommy Cochran flanked the Song
Queen, who shed smiles and a jewelled glit-
ter above vivid pink draperies warmed with
an’ ermine wrap. During one interval Ada
Reeve, trailing yards of flame-colored velvet,
ran into the box for a chat. Dal Monte,
more winsome without the encompassing
blonde wig of Lucia, coquetted endearingly in
orange skirts which billowed silkily under an
over-frothing of black lace. This was
topped by the black velvet straight-jacket of
the period, and a red rose flirted with her
dusky tresses. Her second frock was of
rosy silk, brocaded over in silver and gold
below a deeper pink velvet bodice. A black
lace mantilla veiled the pinkiness for the
final act.
When “Carmen” was staged, on Easter
Saturday, only one male in the circle was in
a lounge suit, and every woman showed bare
shoulders. The fur coat of yesterday has
been superseded by theatre wraps of more or
less gorgeousness, and glittering headbands
provide quite a nice substitute for the
Sparkle of ancestral diadems, which bright-
ened pre-war Covent Garden productions.
The James Barrett, Maudsley and Edward
Miller darnes were in the front row; likewise
Dr. Arthur Morris and his wife and Dr.
Percy Webster and his other half. Dal
Monte and Lina Scavizzi, with a handful of
other operatic stars, overflowed a box and
twittered delightedly between scenes. Aga
Lahoska’s Spanish shawls are as varied as
her emotions. Chief to rouse the green-eyed
monster in the feminine breast is a huge
square of silk embroideries with fringed bor-
ders. This enfolds flounced skirts of cre-
tonne. Another shawl of blue silk covers
petticoatings of green, with an embroidered
hem. Her bull-fighting Sunday best is of
red, with a skirt of gold satin gleaming
through Maltese lace flounces and surmounted
by a mantilla-like head-dress of a stouter
brand of lace.
Incidentally, scene-painter Coleman earns
a whole round of cheers for his bit of these
productions. His seascape in “Otello” is
one of the finest things ever seen on the local
stage.
There was less than the chronic grand-
opera rush to the Good Friday concert at
His Majesty’s, and only the thinnest sprink-
ling of Society’s salt could be detected with
the naked eye. The concert had charms
alike for the godly and the otherwise. In
the Good Friday music of “Parsifal” the
orchestra was a holy joy, and in Rachmanin-
off’s “Christ is Risen” (which never fails
under competent treatment) Prince Obolen-
sky was sufficiently impressive to fetch
encores that included a wonderful Russian
folk-song. The chorus did itself honor in
the Hallelujah scene from “Cavalleria,” and
Toti Dal Monte, beginning with the florid
“Carnival of Venice” variations, was such a
delightful little dear that the audience was
loth to let her go.
When Princess Pat’s sailor husband, Com-
mander Ramsay, gets to Maoriland he and
his staff will switch over from the Dunedin
to the Chatham, which he will take back to
England. The Dunedin will stay behind to
be the Dominion’s flagship. Ramsay did not
take any active part in Melbourne’s fleet
festivities, but he jazzed a bit at Hobart,
and there came from the Speck a wild rumor
that he had invited one of the island’s best-
gilded matfons and her daughter to meet
the squadron in Maoriland with their
steamer trunks ready packed and cross to
England aboard the Chatham. The rumor
was frenzied rather than merely wild; but
it simply thrilled the small island.
Rita McLean- —she is a grand-daughter of
the late Allan McLean, who shared the Pri-
ministry with George Reid —kept her matri-
monial date with Dr. H. G. Furnell at St.
Joseph’s, Malvern, in white brocaded- georg-
ette medievally sleeved to the wrist and
punctuated mid-front with glittering paste.
There was a backwash of silver over a blue
lining, while more blue and glitter clamped
the snowy drift of bridal tulle to her brow.
W. J. McLean led his elder daughter to the
tryst. Sister Lorn a, cousin Gerda McLean
and Alma Simpson ’maided, and the medical
Craigs’ four-year-old Sheila kept the bride’s
silver train from overflowing the course. All
four fluttered like a flight of blue-and-silver
butterflies. Bride’s brother Allan and cousin
Allan Gavan Duffy had the assistance of Dr.
Fulton in looking after the ’groom. Healths
were drunk in the McLeans’ Toorak ball-
room, where an orchestra lay in wait and
later turned on syncopated noises for a jazz.
The newlyweds are now ’mooning in Tas-
mania. ; ■ ' -'i.v V
Margaret Kerr, pictured herewith by Rem-
brandt, is the youthful sculptress who showed
recently in the Queen’s Hall in conjunction
with her artist
father, a well-
known Fitz-
roy business-
m a n, who
dedicates his
leisure hours
to his art.
Both are mem
bers of the
Vic. Artists’
Society. The
most striking
piece in Maid
M a r g a ret’s
collection was
a model of a
founta
which secured
first prize in
a competition
a while ago;
but it is on
figure - work
that she relies
for her future success. The little lady is
developing her modelling talent at the applied
art section of the Workingmen’s College
under sculptor J. S. Davie, and the recent
exhibition was the very first public display
of her work.
One of the activities connected with the
Victoria League is the movement engineered
by Dr. Maudsley’s lady for the encourage-
ment of culture among the Best Known.
As part of it the little Queen’s Hall over-
flowed the other afternoon, when Professor
Tucker talked about Shakspeare’s sonnets.
The speaker put his matter in such an in-
teresting and ir formative way that some of
his listeners wAo had not even a bowing
acquaintance *- th the Bard’s verses felt as
if they now know all about them—and per-
haps hurried home to cure their earlier igno-
rance. Education-Director Frank Tate
seconded the .atidsley dame’s thanks to the
lecturer, after which the lady spread tea
and cakes at the Alexandra Club for the
Professor and about half a hundred of the
audience, which included Lady Charlotte
Rons.
Marie Corelli, whose death has just been
reported, lost her vogue in an extraordinary
way. In 1917 England was in danger of
starvation, and foodstuffs Avere drastically
rationed. It was found that publicity was
the best medicine for hoarders of butter,
sugar and so forth, and when Marie was
convicted of having enough rorbidden pro-
vender concealed at her county house to
stock a small hospital, the authorities saw
that every newspaper reader in the kingdom
heard about it. For months thereafter her
name was a synonym for hypocrisy, greed
and all the unpleasant little vices she had been
scarifying in her novels and articles for 30
years. When the uproar died down Ethel
Dell was on her throne.
Meet the Alfred Hospital’s secretary, D.
C. Macdougall, who took over the job about
two years ago. In addition to his secretarial
work he is the king-pin of the administra-
tion of the Auxiliary branches, which do so
much for the institution’s finances. He was
a happy man
the other day
when Ameri-
can surgeon
Mayo de-
scribed the
Alfred as the
finest hospital
lie had ever
seen. Macdou-
gall, who in his
pre-secretarial
days was for
a quarter of a
century on the
Inky Way, is a
whale for rais-
ing money.
During the
war he took a
leading part in
raking in
£700.000 for
the Y.M.C.A.’s
work for Bill-
jim, and since settling down at the Alfred
he has helped to net £BO,OOO for building
expansion.
Members of the South Yarra Children’s
Hospital Auxiliary met the other afternoon
at the Poolmah sisters’ Kensington-road
home to unload their monthly offerings of
Lilliputian sheets and nighties, and pick up
a fresh supply of material. As the Chauvel
lady was not there to fill the presidential
chair, Miss Poolman went on as under-
study, and revealed the lamentable fact that
the bank balance had dwindled to a few
pounds. The afternoon’s discussion and
business was topped off with tea and cake
in the dining-room. Members are giving a
hand with the canteen which is now in full
swing at the hospital. Not so many weeks
back there were dilapidated storerooms on
the site, and as the money to convert them
into a canteen was not forthcoming hope had
been practically abandoned when somebody
thought of approaching the Trades Hall.
Thereupon along came a horde of plumbers,
carpenters, painters and so on, and in their
spare hours they turned the barn-like place
into the most perfectly-equipped hospital
shop in the city. Cheers for the warm-
hearted unionists!
Toti dal Monte is having a thrilling time
in Melbourne. First her dressing-room was
invaded by one of those mysterious persons
who seem to get their living by working up
“sensations” for an excitable press. Then
Toti was absent from a rehearsal, and the
telephone exchange was almost wrecked in
carrying urgent calls to every address- that-
could be thought of in the time available.
The distracted management was about to
requisition black-trackers when the lady
blithely arrived with the explanation that she
had forgotten all about the appointment in
her excitement at finding swans in the
Botanical Gardens. Somebody will have to
keep an eye on Miss dal Monte. It is
appalling to reflect that she might miss
a first night through dawdling to feed
jujubes to the hippopotamus at the Zoo.
Mrs. George James bagged the Lyceum
Club dining-room in which to farewell her
friends over the teacups. She said her good-
byes in dove-grey tailorings under a black
velvet toque, with a huge ribbon bow on the
port side. With her Major husband she goes
aboard the JSneas on Saturday. The club’s
door-bell was worked overtime the whole
afternoon, and in the crowd were sighted
Dr. Springthorpe and his wife, Professor
Ewart’s musical other half, Mrs. Jack Arm-
strong (Sydney), Mrs. Henry Rosenthal,
and Mrs. Victor Selheim.
The Speck’s half-dozen recently-appointed
women J’s.P. include Mrs. Frances M.
Edwards, of Hobart, a keen worker in local
health affairs (her husband belongs to the
family that owned the Bendigo Indepen-
dent in the days of the goldfield’s great-
ness) ; Mrs. Ida Tynan and Mrs. E. L.
Smith, of Launceston ; and Mrs. Eliza Bur-
nell, of Burnie, who was prominent in coun-
try Labor circles for years. The last-named
is the mother of the scholarly and attrac-
tive Enid Burnell whose ’Varsity career,
which gave promise of something brilliant in
literature, was cut short to enable her to
marry ex-teacher .T. A. Lyons, now Premier
of the Speck. Despite the fact that Mrs.
Lyons is the happy possessor of half a dozen
babies, and “does for” the family entirely
with her own hands, she still finds time to
i make fairly frequent and always eloquent
! appearances on the public platform. Her
address on Empire Migration to the recent
' conference of the National Council of
Women was acclaimed as one of the most
notable performances of the gathering.
i _ The estate left by Speaker John Macke*
is infinitesimal. Besides the widow there
, are half a dozen children, ranging from A
girl of 18 to an infant six months old.
Mackey felt it incumbent upon him to “keep
up” the position of Speaker, and savings
; out of the allowance of £lOOO at first and
then £l2OO were apparently not found pos-
sible. The fascination of politics was too
much for him, and he let his chances at the
Bar go. Assembly members are consulting
one another in whispers as to the possi-
bility of a grant. The precedents quoted,
which are not quite analogous, are the £lOOO
a year for ex-Speaker C. G. Duffy, the lump
sum of £4OOO for ex-Speaker Lalor, and the
purchase of an annuity of £5OO a year for
Graham Berry, who, however, was something
more than an ex-Speaker.
The anti-vivisectionists, whose numbers
have swelled visibly in the past few months,
had their annual meeting in the Lloyd Tay-
lor sisters’ Brighton home, Pen-y-Bryn, on
Saturday. There was a big muster; but tile
Hodges lady, the new vice-president, tvas
unable to get down froni Macedon for the
event. _ The thing is a branch of the Bng-
lish society launched by the late Lord Salis-
bury. The speeches were few but inspiring,
not to say (in some instances) .horrifying.
It was pointed out that there is a laW which
bars any but registered vivisectionists from
practising on dumb animals ; but seeing that
an Unregistered person who operated Upon
rats was recently discharged on the grounds
that the end justified the means, someone re-
marked that it seems Authority is net very
greatly concerned about the matter. The
law also lays down a rule that an animal
must be kept under anaesthetics, in the tor-
ture chamber; but no effort is made to enforce
this. Helena MacDougall, the hon. she.,
who devotes much time and money to the
eause,. will now seek to enrol Victorian chil-
dren in the defence of their four-footed
friends.
Lady Stradbroke has broadcasted invi-
tations for an at-home on April 29 to launch
an appeal on behalf of the District Nursing
Society. The gathering will be staged in
the Federal Government House drawing-
room, lent for the purpose by the absent
G.-G.’s. _ Money-raising operations are to
open with a matinee performance at the
Palace Theatre, when Mrs. Pitt Rivers will
again test her weight as leading lady, with
Seymour Hicks as principal boy. Dame
Nellie has promised her interest and sealed
the agreement with a cheque for a box. Mrs.
Fred Payne is to head a squad of the Best
Gilded who will make it their business to
secure a full house, and Mrs. Hewison will
shoulder the hon. secretary’s pen.
A word or two from Adelaide;—
The A.R.C. races were a drear business for there
who were tempted into thin frocks by a. summer
hiorning, only to be half-drowned by the deluge
that descended soon after lunch. Late-comers had
better luck, and you could almost swear to the
time people left home by the clothes they wore. Among
the coat-and-skirted brigade were Lady Bridges, who
topped black with a snug hat of the same color, and
flung-wßile fufs about 7 4iief shoulders; Miss Judge,
wherwas in navy with a dash of Oriental color in
her hat; Miss * Gwen Hall, in well-tailored grey;
and Mrs. George Fraser, in brown.
The Women’s Club ran an Easter Egg Fair the
other day. It Was opened by the President, Miss
Adelaide Meitlike, and among those who helped it
along to success were the Misses Watson, Amy Tom-
kinson, C. Thallon, Lamb and Marjorie Capper. An
other club jamboree was organised by the newlv-
launched All Nations Chums, who had their first
party in the Victoria Hall and filled it with small
persons in every imaginable variety of national
dress. A word or two from the movement’s god
father, G. E. Hale, helped to fill in the afternoon.
The Bucklands, here on a visit from England (she
is the second daughter of the Tom Barr Smiths),
were lunched at Government House, with the Van
Raaltes and G. D. Cowmans to meet them. The
week has given us a vice-regal dinner, too, with
the Chief Justice Murrays and half a dozen out
going Ministers and their wives as the guests.
The Mayoress, back from a visit to her daughter
at Narracoorte, gave a party in the Town Hall in
hemr of Mrs. de Castro, who said a word or two
in praise of the English-speaking Union. The list
of guests who turned up looks as though the enthu-
siastic little Englishwoman’s hard work for the
Union is at last going to bear some fruit.
Conservatorium students went gay the other even-
ing when 300 or so turned up at the first students’
social of the season at the Elder Hall. Sonie
remarks by director Harold Davies and M. Schliskv
cleared the way for more frivolous matters, which
included a skit on Conservatorium life written by
Mrs. K. H. Weston and her daughter and produced
by the latter. Supper and dancing followed.
The one woman candidate in the Parliamentary
election was Mrs. A. K. Goode, who tried to wrest
one of the three Adelaide seats from Labor. “Agnes
Knight Goode?” an opponent said pleasantly of her,

“The gardener pats down the seed-bed firm and smooth, sprinkles the seed on it, and covers up with a layer of very
finely-pulverised soil. The moisture rises to the compacted sub-surface, where the seeds are, and the top layer prevents
evaporation.” This is ideal sowing, and the “SUNTYNE” Combined Drill and Cultivator does this work on a large scale.
1 7 tyne sows 8 rows, cultivates 5 ft.
25 tyne sows 12 rows, cultivates
29 tyne sows 1 4 rows, cultivates B^ft.
3 3 tyne sows 1 6 rows, cultivates 9 £ ft.
41 tyne sows 20 rows, cultivates 12ft.
Capital is saved by having one implement do the work of two. Labor is saved by cutting out one working with the
cultivator. Seed is saved because every grain is covered. And the increased yield soon pays for the implement.
The Combined Drill is an Australian invention, and the Suntyne was the pioneer. Compare prices, and the Australian-
made SUNTYNE will be found pounds cheaper than any other, although more sturdily built.

The ESSEX-SIX
Built by Hudson under Hudson Patents
Smoothness in operation, unusual
flexibility, and splendid road perform-
ance, are qualities which have caused
the leading British Motoring Journals
to pass flattering comments on the
ESSEX-SIX.
“‘The Motor,’* February 5, 1924, says:—
“The engine is vibrationless and will
take the car along at 2\ m.p.h. without
a tremor. . . .From this speed a ready
pick-up can be obtained without chang-
ing down.... Thirty miles per hour
seems but ten or twelve, so smooth is the
engine. . . .The acceleration on second is
terrific and it is one of the most lively
cars in which we have ridden.”
Such praise from the British Press is one of the
greatest compliments the car could possibly
have received.

"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
. Lots of punters who fancied the topweight
for the Doncaster Handicap took 6 to 4 and 7 to 4
from the odds-crampers who ply their parasitic
calling’ at li and wick. The tote price was, roughly
■2 to 1 for a win and your money back if the horse
lan into a place. In point of fact, Claro was nearer
last than first. His rider told the reporters that he
had had a stormy passage, and probably a dozen
other jockeys presented the same report, for it was
about the roughest Doncaster ever seen. At the
end of a furlong, Whittier (10’s) was leading from
Trimacre (25’s) and The Monk (20’s), and they
finished m that order at intervals of half a neck
and four lengths. As a rule, it is safe to bet “in
running against pacemakers in a race like the
Doncaster or Epsom, but the trio in question, being
well clear of a bunched field, escaped the trouble
which The Wild Goose, Otacre and Mont Clair struck
m particularly large quantities, and had the finish
to themselves. At the bottom of the straight the
meteorologist’s tip, All Sunshine, momentarily looked
like catching them, but he died on his long run
out of the ruck and subsided into fourth place,
Duke Isinglass, Hermealdo and Prince Woorak fol-
lowing, with daylight between. Whittier is owned
by the Victorian Ben Chaffey, is trained at Bendigo
by McCalman, and was ridden by Dempsey. It was a
fine performance to carry 9st. 61b. and lead for
seven furlongs of a mile
run in lmin. 36isec.
(an Australian record),
hut Wooralc’s brilliant
little son was fortunate
in getting an undis-
turbed run on the rails.
Trimacre is trained at
Kosehill by Booth and
was piloted by Toohey,
who made a great effort
to bring off his fourth
successive Doncaster.
He won on Speciality
jn 1921, on Julia Grey
in 1922 and on The
Epicure last year.

Davids presence in the Autumn Stakes field pro-
bably robbed The Hawk of a victory. With David
on The Hawk, might have slowed down
e field to his liking; but the old fellow set a smart
pace and hung on resolutely in the straight when
ihe Hawk and The Rover tackled him. While the
three were fighting it out Reed brought Rapine
along with an irresistible run, and the four-year-old
,‘ a ™ an Scldnig got home by three-quarters of a
iength with The Rover, David and Englefield almost
aDreast. The winner paid .even money on the one-
two machine, and that was his price with many, of
although a few reckless spirits laid
n*’ Leger provided the customary one-horse
\nL 1 i rol i g 0 was T a lO’to-D favorite, but, like Sir
STM L ady Valais (5 to 2) dashed to
the front about three furlongs from home, and after
mat it was a procession, Prances Tressady, Drongo
and Highlander being closest to the beautiful chest-
nut at the end. Toohey had an easy ride on the
Newcastle filly, whose time, 2min. 69£sec., was a
record for Randwick. Valais, her sire, has been sold
for 14,400 guineas to the Thompsons of Widder.,
where Claro will also stand when his racing career
is over.
The Sires’ Produce Stakes was another soft thing
for John Brown’s Leslie Wallace (s’s), by Wallace
Isinglass—Countess Malt. Heroic, the even-money fav-
orite, was left at the post, and John’s chestnut had
little trouble in settling the outsiders Versine and
Brimming. He is as speedy as they make them, but
is very excitable and may not stay. More of an
Epsom than a Derby horse, perhaps.
When betting opened on the Tocal Handicap there
was a rush to get on Stand By, a black colt full
of quality and obviously in beautiful condition
(the Randwick critics of his trainer notwithstand-
ing), and the South Australian was soon at 6 to 4.
Next in demand were Our Prince, Mirthmaker and
the burly Brown Rajah, Stony being at 12’s and
14’s. With only 11 starters and a mile and a half
to travel the race should have been free from acci-
dents, but, as it chanced, Mirthmaker came down
near the six-furlongs post, and Stand By also toppled
over. Each was going well at the time, and one or
other might have won instead of Stony, who was
three parts of a length to the good of Our Prince
and Bungarley at the judge’s box. Stand By and
Mirthmaker were hurt when they fell, and both
had to be withdrawn from the Sydney Cup, for
which the colt had been a short-priced favorite,
and the Comedy King horse a strong public fancy
and handicapper’s tip. It was rotten luck for their
owners, trainers and ante-post supporters, and the
situation wasn’t improved when the stewards weighed
in with the quite superfluous information that “both
falls were accidental.” No one but an idiot would
suggest that they were deliberately brought about,
but the public doesn’t want supererogatory ver-
dicts ; it wants to know why so many valuable
horses fall, are galloped on or knocked from pillar
to post at Randwick. There are more of those
“accidents” on the A.J.C. course than on any other
track in Australia, and a suspicion exists that most
of them are attributable to the plethora of appren-
tice jockeys and the efforts of older horsemen to
bully these children into “pulling out” for them,
which bullying is sometimes attended with disastrous
results.
Drizzling rain fell on Sunday and Monday morn-
ing, and when the Sydney Cup was run all the sting
had gone out of the going. The conditions would
have suited Mirthmaker perfectly—they were prac-
tically identical with those which obtained at Rose-
hill on April 5, when he donkey-licked a crowd of
Cup candidates in the Club Handicap. Dynamite-
odds made Accarak favorite at 5 to 2, Woorak’s
elder brother being the second leg of the double
backed (for no great amount) by the Chaffey-McCal-
man stable, but there was really more public money
for Lady Valais, at 9 to 2, and boodle came
solidly for The Rover (B’s), Our Prince and Stony
(9’s) and Pennybont (14’s and 12’s). Among the
friendless section were Scarlet, King of the Forest
and Drongo, who were all at 100 to 3, yet they ran
first, second and a very close fourth, Stony splitting
Scarlet and King of the Forest. Barosca cut out
the running in the King’s interest, with Hit, Accarak,
Drongo and The Rover in hot pursuit, and Stony and
Scarlet moving up gradually from the rear division to
the van. Stony and Pennybont were the leaders into the
straight, but Scarlet came fast, and, finishing better
than Stony, of whom rather too much use was made
(the same applies to Accarak), won a pretty race
by three-quarters of a length, King of the Forest
being just behind Stony. The latter was fading
at the finish, and with another 100 yards to go the
plodding Drongo would have been second. Behind
the Lanius colt were Highlander, Accarak and Our
Prince, who dwelt at the post, and, in the circum-
stances, did very well to finish seventh. Scarlet is
a lovely bay by Bright Steel —Red Ink. One
of the Winter Irvings owns her, and she was ridden
by young Crowe, who is apprenticed to Booth, which
shrewd trainer nearly repeated his 1923 feat of land-
ing the Doncaster and Cup. A V.R.C. Oaks winner
Scarlet was fancied a month ago, but a failure at
Moorefield, reports that David was easily beating her
on the track, and the substitution of an unknown boy
for Toohey, the stable jockey—who, it was argued,
would have put up a few pounds overweight had the
stable thought it worth while —accounted for her
drift in the market.
Monday was a memorable day for Dynamiteodds.
Not one favorite got home, and three of the seven
winners—Scarlet, Nouveau Riche and Julia Grey
were skinners for most fielders. Vet prices didn’t
lengthen on that account. The odds quoted by the
newspapers, as regards losers, are misleading to the
extent that they are unobtainable from many of the
gentry who put on the bag. In the absence of a
straightout tote thousands of casual punters who
attend these big meetings are robbed right and left.

“0.K.”: If Whittier will but remain
strong- enough on the leg there was so much alarmist
talk about before the Doncaster, he may live to rival
the record of Paris, a horse who, 30 years ago, could
win anything up to 12 furlongs, and nothing at a
longer distance. Paris took the Doncaster Handicap
in 1890, but had been unplaced in the Metropolitan
the same season, when the distance was two miles.
Two years later Paris won his first Caulfield Cup,
carrying Bst. 81b. Next year he won the Metropoli-
tan, the distance then being reduced to 15 furlongs,
and next year (1894) as an aged horse, Paris scored
his second Caulfield Cup with 9st. 41b. aboard.
Meanwhile the brilliant little fellow had proved an
utter failure at two miles. Whittier strikes one as
being just that sort of animal.
* * * »
Australia is the only country in the world
where an enormous number of men are as coy about
figuring publicly as owners of racehorses as they
might be of appearing in the press in the capacity
of pigeon-shooters. Of the 10 likeliest-looking
starters for the A.J.C. Sires’ Produce Stakes on
Saturday five were owned by gentlemen who rac"d
under aliases, and it was the same in the St.
Leger. _ Oddly enough, one of the few prominent
owners in England who has raced under a nom de
course was an Australian—“ Mr. Fairie.” There, as
in France and the U.S.A., the possession of thorough-
breds of class is one of the hall-marks of wealth
and fashion.

The tote gave itself a bold advertisement
at the Autumn meeting of the Adelaide R. C.
Remarquer, a hurdler, had the minimum weight in a
flat race. He got home by a nose, and returned a
dividend of £135 14s. on the £1 tote; the second
horse paid £l7 10s. Out on the flat Remarquer
was almost unknown, and the half-crown machine
there gave the amazing dividend of £5l 4s. 6d.

The Stawell Easter Gift, which ranks as
a sort of Melbourne Cup for the professional ped—-
£155 and a gold medal is the winner’s guerdon, with
£6O, £25 and £lO for his nearest pursuers—
attracted the usual crowd of fleet competitors from
all over the Commonwealth. It takes two dozen
heats to find the semi-finalists. The back-markers
made little show this year, the ultimate winner turn-
ing up in W. P. Twomey, a local product, with
yards start, who streaked home ahead of Pemberthy
(B£yds.), Hunt (9) and Roberts (11). Twomey
seems to have been regarded as a stone moral before
the final, for the books refused to lay him. His
time was 12 1-lOsec.—just under “evens.”.
A PRECARIOUS POSITION.
EMPLOYER: “Mr. Biggs, I hear you have
been speculating rather heavily on the
racecourse.”
BIGGS: “I do have a flutter occasionally, sir.
Won a hundred on Whittier.”
EMPLOYER: “I'll have no gamblers here —
unless I’m in with ’em. Anything good

15-30 ’: Norman Brookes, now in Eng-
land, has been publishing some comment which ought
to be of interest both in Australia and America.
Talking of the alleged quickening up of modern
tennis, he declares that it is no faster than it was
in the heyday of his own celebrity, and affirms that
Wilding was every bit as speedy as Tilden. Brookes
might bave included the name of McLoughlin, who,
in my opinion, has never been surpassed for dynamic
force on the courts. But Mac. lacked steadiness, and
it is the steady man, who sacrifices the spectacular
game for sound technique, that achieves the lasting
reputation. Brookes prophesies the downfall of the
American girl Helen Wills if she ever meets Suzanne
Lenglen. Helen is a graduate of the hard-driving
school, whereas the Frenchwoman plays to Brookes’s
own way of thinking, and he knows from his own
experience that the slogger, however brilliant, is
an easy victim as soon as he (or she) is prevented
the full use of forehand or backhand by well-placed
services and returns. From all I have heard of
Suzanne’s play I should say that she compels her
opponent to lose her length and direction, which in
most cases is the preliminary to a nervous collapse.

Like other Australian boxers that have
visited the U.S.A. Hughie Dwyer isn’t so good as
when he set out on his travels. He has developed
a bit of a punch but lost a lot of his speed, and it
was speed that won for Eddie Butcher in their
match at the Sydney Stadium. The Westralian light-
weight always commences briskly, and his long
straight left broke through Dwyer’s defence many
times. In the tenth it landed on the chin and
Dwyer went to the canvas for a space. After that
the former lightweight champion used the right at
even' opportunity, and in the 16th he very nearly
settled the boy from Boulder City. A right uppercut
floored Butcher for nine seconds, and another sent
him down for ‘six. The Westralian looked dead to
the world when carried to his corner, but he made
a swift recovery and fought the remaining rounds so
ruggedly that Dwyer was limp at the finish. Butcher
got the decision, and the pair divided £312 for
their hour’s work.
* * * *
A cable mentions that Sam Langford is
“down and out and going blind.” In ways he was
the most remarkable pugilist that ever entered a
ring. Barely sft. 6in. in height he weighed close
on 15 stone in condition, and was the only man in
the world whom Johnson feared at his (Johnson’s)
best. The explanation of the champion’s diffidence
was Langford’s terrific right-hand punch, which in
Johnson’s phrase “might kill any man.” Langford,
who was not a black, but a light mulatto, was
about the nearest thing as regards conformation to
pithecanthropus erectus that the present generation
has seen. His arms were so long relatively to his
legs (his body was that of a giant) that he could
pick up a dropped cigar, while standing upright,
by bending a little to one side. He got few chances
to show his powers. In his prime,'as now, white
boxers drew the color line whenever performers of
Langford’s class loomed over the championship hori-
zon ; and the public has never rushed to see two
colored men scrap. When in Australia, a dozen
years ago, Langford was understood to have saved
money, and his diamonds were admired; but it is an
irrefragable convention in the U.S.A., apparently,
that all colored pugs shall die broke.
Rowing in Adelaide has had a nasty knock,
it having been decided that the Torrens Lake is at
present unfit for the sport carried on there ever
since the river was dammed 40 years ago. Flood
waters bring down silt, and mudbanks form faster
than the dredger can remove them. In any water
less than 10 or 12 feet deep,' weeds shoot up, and now
the only channel fit for rowing in is narrow and
winding. The association, having a big autumn
regatta on, with Murray River crews prominent,
felt it could not ask them to race on a cramped
course, and shifted the scene to the saltwater,
along the wharves at Port Adelaide. All the Torrens
racing boats went down by train,
* * * *
“Winkle”: Several clubs are complaining
that the district scheme of football in Melbourne keeps
good men out of the League game. Essendon has
four smart rovers in Hardy, Shorten, Maher and
Watt, but it can only play two in that position, so
local juniors with a talent for roving have no chance
of employing it among the seniors. Collingwood
always has an overplus of centres; at Richmond
several good backs are generally looking over the
fence, and more big, husky followers than can be
regularly played seem to evolve in the Carlton and
Fitzroy districts. In the reserves of every club, and
in junior teams in each district, there are good
players who would become regulars could they but
transfer to the League XVIII in need of a man of
their particular quality,
“Oxmead”: “Ex-Englishman” gives only
10 names in the All England team —of which he
notes that Lord Harris is now the lone survivor—
that beat Australia at Lords by 6 wickets in
September, 1880 (B. 17/4/’24). The eleventh player
was Frank Penn, of Kent, who, I seem to remember,
batted more steadily than any of his better-known
colleagues in the second innings. The four least
famous of the Australians who took part in the
match were, as “E.E.” indicates, Moule, Alexander,
Qroube and Slight; none the less they were all notably
good fields. London Punch printed some verses on
the game ; one couplet ran:—-
Blackham at wicket, Slight at point test nerves of
sternest stuff,
And think not, if ye sky or spoon, that Groube or
Moule will muff.
There was also a reference to a fine catch by Alexan-
der in the same rhyme, which had a ring in it of
Clement Scott, the dramatic critic.
* * * *
One of the quaintest examples of an Eng-
lish institution which has failed utterly to assimi-
late to the soil of N. S. Wales (hunting, by the
way, is another) is the I Zingari Cricket Club.' The
English I Zingari can with equal ease put an XI of
amateur champions, of millionaires or of peers into
the field. It is the most fashionable cricket club in
the world, not even excepting the M.C.C. Its Syd-
ney offshoot, which played a S.S.S. team chiefly com-
posed of middies last week, has the right to sport
the famous colors but there the resemblance
abruptly stops. No amateur of note ever figures
in its frolics on the Rusheutter’s Bay oval, and in
the social sense it is unknown. It is as incongruous
as if Oxford’s Bullingdon Club (whose members are
mostly dukes, and are distinguishable from the com-
mon herd of undergrads by their glaring blue-and-
white hat-ribbons and ties) were’ to open a branch
at the Sydney ’Varsity.
**" * *
M. A. Noble, whose 30 years’ association
with the Paddington C. C. was commemorated by a
banquet last week, is the type of cricketer who never
dies in the executive sense. He is 51, yet this year
he took 29 wickets for Paddington at an average of
14.31. The geniuses of the game go early. Who
ever hears of Gilbert Jessop now? “Ranji” has not
figured prominently in cricket of any real class for
over a decade. It is the unspectacular craftsman—
C. B. Fry, Noble, Maclaren, Armstrong—who goes
on and on, and is almost as good at 50, except in
the field, as when he was painfully, doggedly acquir-
ing strokes and length at 29.
* * * *
“Percy Pawnticket” : America may not go
in much for cricket (B. 10/4/’24), but it is pro-
bably the only country in the world that runs a
marbles championship. This was played recently at
Philadelphia, the winner being an 'athlete of' 17.
Judging by a newspaper photo of the finalists at
work “little ring” is the game in which champion-
ships are won and lost.
“Centurion”: The Hibernians, Protestant
churches, the Y.M.C.A.. and similar Sydney associa-
tions are to have a new rival in the field in the
Jewish Snorting Association. This is composed of
the Young People’s Hebrew Association, the Macca-
bean Institute, the Maccabean Social and Athletic
Club, the Jewish Social and Sport Club, and the
Jewish Amateur Athletic Association —Tatt.’s is
apparently barred. Football, baseball, athletics,
tennis and boxing l are all on the season’s programme,
while billiards, with its three balls, will, no doubt’
assert a claim to be included. Later on the new
association will engage Melbourne Jewry in an
all-round sporting tournament.
* * * *
“Hamer”: The cable hasn’t mentioned
whether Capablanea won or drew his game with
Lasker in the New York tournament. Anyhow the
Cuban finished second to the veteran, who had 12
wins and 6 draws to his credit, against the Cuban’s
nine wins and nine draws. The chances are that
the pair will now meet in a challenge series to
decide who is champion of the world.

Chief Secretary Oakes, of N. S. Wales, did
well to limit the number of quail that mav be shot
by any one gun in a day to 50. A deputation, com-
posed largely of men who had slain these birds by
the hundred in their time, made a despairing effort
to get the figure fixed at 100, but Oakes was influ-
enced by the farmers’ representations in favor of the
quail as an insect-eater. The farming industry
apart, however, there is a strong feeling against the
wholesale slaughter of game which occurs periodically
near the populated centres of out-back Australia.
The opening of the duck-sliooting season in most dis-
tricts is the signal for a massacre as senseless as it
is cruel. Not only are many more birds killed than
can possibly be eaten or even sold (some of the big-
gest battues are held out of range of a freezing-
chamber), but an effect of the internal bombardment
is to drive many of those that escape unwounded
out of the district. If a bag of 50 is accepted as
reasonable in the case of quail-shooters, one of ten
or a dozen should satisfy those who go after duck.
And then the time should be ripe for regulations
protecting the harmless pigeon and that useful
scavenger, the sparrow—birds that are at present
massacred by the thousand over traps.

Samplers and quilts beneath their small, deft hands
Take pleasing shape and with fair colors glow;
Here a dalmatic loud applause commands,
There copes and stoles like garden roses blow.
Throughout the room genteel excitement reigns
As each competitor for victory strains.
No brutal creatures these who needs must kill
With lethal weapons when intent on sport.
Some peers stick pigs; of fun these get their fill
By sticking silk. Never would they resort
To spurring equine mounts o’er field or course;
A needle is their harmless hobby horse.
Small wonder that their gentle audience
Grows with enthusiasm fairly wild ;
And breaks all bounds and cheers with vehemence
When the announcement comes in accents mild:—
Basket all work!” And then: “Let no one stir!
The Earl’s the winner by a diaper!”

TYPE--B SEDAN
A woman will usually admire one thing about
a car and a man another, but there is one feature
of the new Type-B Sedan which both admire
equally and emphatically—its exceptional driving
ease.
This is due to a combination of several important
improvements— a roomier front compartment; a
readier clutch response; a new steering wheel that
offers a trim, firm grip; and control levers that
are ideally accessible, yet conveniently out of
the way of robes and luggage.

THE INKY WAY.
Henry Lucy (“Toby, M.P ”) left a fortune of a
quarter of a million—a record for a working journ sl-
ist in England.
“Te Pana”: After 17 years as chief sub of
Christchurch (M.L.) Press, Alex. Burns has been
appointed assistant editor. He kicked off in the
newspaper game with the N.Z. Press Association in
the days when George Atack, now gen. manager,
worked like a Trojan filling in cable copy.
“R.N.8.”; Australian writers who submit scenarios
to American film concerns should save their postage,
as Yank producers— most of them, anyhow—are not
reading original stories. The rejection form is candid:
“We are returning, unread,” etc. The firms offer
the excuse that an original has not the prestige of
a published book, play or story by a well-known
author. That’s their interest in the promotion oi
literature 1 They are frankly mcnsy-grubbers.
An ex-Melbourne man, H. F. Reeve, who graduated
at Melbourne Uni. and was for a time in the Vic.
Civil Service, is responsible for a book upon “The
Black Republic”—Liberia, which was promoted by
some American philanthropists with the idea of
showing how well the negroes of the U.S.A. could
govern themselves and extend the blessings of civili-
sation to their black brethren in Africa. The book
mainly show's what a failure they have made of it.
“A. Jane”: All Bananalanders should find some-
thing to interest them in “Hell’s Hatches,” a recem
novel by Lewis Freeman. Here one learns that it b
a custom of the country to pursue runaway blacks
from sugar plantations (apparently adjacent to the
main street in Townsville) with bloodhounds. Mr.
Freeman’s bloodhounds are the property' of a dis-
solute ex-bushranger, who, being on the friendliest
terms with the Chief of Police, lends him the dogs
whenever a nigger hunt is looming. To Sydneysiders
it will come as news that the “Art Gallery attached
to the Government Museum of New South Wales"
is habitually borrowed by visiting artists for exhibi-
tions of their paintings.
“Rita”: In the past black-and-white artists found
Adelaide a difficult hunting-ground; but since Hal
Gye was appointed to the News things have vastly
improved. The Register keeps J. H. Chinner’s pen
busy on caricatures, and Oswald Pryor is a fixtuie
on the Sun. Incidentally, the recent elections gave
the black-and-white men some extra opportunities.
Chinner depicted what would happen to the State
under a Socialist regime, while Oswald Pryor supplied
some string work on the future of S.A. under Bar-
well’s “black labor” and “Yankee importation"
schemes. So far Langdon Bonython has not added
an artist to the ’Tiser.
“Morehead”: The office cherub at first found his
Sunday-school training a handicap, but long months
of misinforming callers as to the Editor’s whereabouts
had dulled his conscience. One afternoon a gloomy-
looking person who might have been an elder in the
Specially Particular Baptists floated up and demanded
access to the chief. “He’s out,” lied the boy. “Will
you swear to that?” replied the melancholy one m
the tones of Moses reproving an irreverent Israelite.
“Sure,” returned the youngster, going cn with his
job of addressing envelopes to carrv back rejected
MSS. to disgusted authors. The visitor’s face grew
suspicious, then forbidding. Opening a Gladstone bag
he produced a thumbed Bible. “Kiss the Good Book,
he commanded dourly, “and swear what you say is
true.” The youngster paled a little at the idea of
downright perjury, but he was quick to think of a
compromise. “I can’t do that, Mister,” he said.
“Me old man’s an atheist. But I’ll blow out a
match for you.”
“Podsnap”: Whenever there is any sort of foreign
invasion, Melbourne Herald shows its superiority by
printing greetings and compliments in the language
of the visitors. Thus when a couple of French war-
ships looked in a while back, the office linguist got
busy, and the lino-men had the work of their lives
trying to make the English unadorned “e” pose as
“e” or “6.”, A language bereft of unaccented vowels,
not to mention the circumflex and the cedilla, was
no medium for the expression of perfect Parisian,
and the result, to a Frenchman, must have been
exceedingly quaint. The Herald did better with its
ideographic welcome to the Japs., for the characters
were written down by a local professor of the tongue
and a zinc; block made of the message. Now that
the opera eo. is busy in Melbourne, we are informed
by some prima donna or other that the “pnblwo
Australiano ” is “vergine di emozione” —-literally
“virgin of emotions” —and that the lady is “enthnsi-
asta” about her reception. Unfortunately the lino will
insist on printing the first-person pronoun (“to ) as
“to” and even made the maestro a lady—in a long
and scholarly critique by Carlyle Smythe. And this,
as the erudite Smythe could say' in 17 otnei
languages, is a trifle over the odds.
“Smithers” : The Melbourne P.M. press has enjoyed
a good deal of liberty in connection with sensational
murder trials, but it beat all records in the case
of Angus Murray. Not content with arguing tne
question of the commutation of the sentence, one
sheet, started publishing the comments of alleged
jurymen, whereupon its contemporary weighed in
with rebutting testimony' by the foreman. IVhat the
jurymen said is of no moment now, but their emei-
gince is verv important indeed. For their own
protection the Law endeavors to conceal their identity
ns much as possible, and there is supposed to be an
obligation of secrecy regarding the proceedings in
the jurv-room. The temptation to talk about then
part in a life-and-death drama is, however, irresistible
in many' instances: vet it is rare for them to step
into the limelight and endeavor to influence the
Executive by specific pleadings which are quite
outside their function as jurymen. It is obvious
that if jurymen can be induced by newspapers io
publicly review their own decisions and reveal inside
information that can be turned into “copy,” tne
system of trial by jury is very near its end. The
wholp business is beginning' to call for attention D.
the Government. Censorship is not desirable—we
had enough of that during the war—but what is fair
comment” should be more rigidly defined for the
benefit of journals that consistently abuse the privi-
lege in their competition for coppers.
COMPENSATIONS.
[FOR THE BULLETN.]
’Tis grand to be a minus bard,
Below the reach of babel;
While other names are made or marred
Your standing’s always stable.
Though sweet success you never taste,
Nor rapt adorers con you,
At least no critic Jove will waste
Good thunderbolts upon you.
For you are much too paltry game
For his sublime attention
Who lives by filching dead men’s fame
And damning live invention.
Should some celebrity affray
Your soul with jealous sorrow,
Remember he who’s praised- to-day
Will be condemned to-morrow.
His work you never hope to match,
But there’s this satisfaction:
Already your long ears can catch
The murmurs of detraction,
The hiss of critics yet unborn,
Who’ll spy his hid offences
And tear his poems up in scorn
As falsest of pretences.
Olympus, too, does scarce abound
In saints: it is no Zion—
Better to be a happy hound
Than a maltreated lion.
You have, in short, instead of wings,
That which no fame offsets ;
The peace that dwells with lowly things
Like worms and violets.
VICTORIA.

REXONOLA
PATENTED
REFLECTOR
SOUND CHAMBER
<sr

Here is the Explanation
of the IVonderful ‘Tone
of the REXONOLA
Like many other great inventions, the
principle of the Rexonola Patented Reflector
Sound Chamber —the secret of the won-
derful tone of the Rexonola—is extremely
simple. Sound, like light, may be reflected ;
as in the camera the light rays must be
correctly focussed, so in the talking machine
the sound waves should be focussed.
The Rexonola was the first talking machine
in which twelve years ago, this principle
was recognised and applied. After many
experiments the exactly correct construc-
tion of the sound chamber was arrived at,
discord was eliminated, the “blurred”
notes which jar the ear of the musician
done away with, and the tone made full
and rich and resonant.
As an aid to understanding the general
construction of the various parts of a
Rexonola, the illustration shows in simpli-
fied form, the main essentials.
1. Sound Box or Reproducer—a delicate
piece of mechanism which picks up
the notes recorded by the vibrations
of the needle.
2. The Tone Arm, along which the notes
pass to the Sound Chamber.
3. The Turntable, on which the records
are revolved.
4. The Compartment for the Motor
which revolves the Turntable.
5. The Sound Chamber, which amplifies
the tones transmitted through the
Tone Arm.
0. The Rexonola Patented Reflector
feature, for ensuring correct “ Tone
Focus.”
The Rexonola Patented Reflector
Sound Chamber is a feature fully
protected by patents and therefore
cannot be imitated on any other
talking machine.
£Musical Pleasures
Everyone can Enjoy
ON a long winter’s evening when there is nothing to do, time passes on lagging
feet, and you are glad when bedtime comes, what a difference music could
. ma ke. But perhaps nobody in the house is a musician ; the piano maybe is
a “ silent ” one which none of the family can play.
There is a place in every Australian home for a Rexonola, the talking machine that
can give you just those musical pleasures you have longed for. It is never “ too
tired to play; it has an inexhaustible repertoire, embracing thousands of disc
records of every make. Whether you feel in the mood for the soothing old-time
melodies, the stirring strains of a march played by a world-famous band, or the lilt
of the latest dance hit, it is yours to command.
Those with an “ear” for music will realise that this is no ordinary talking machine.
The scientific construction of the sound chamber banishes discord and gives a tone
full and clear and pure. If you are near any Rexonola dealer, take the opportunity
of hearing any of the wide range of Rexonola models to-day.
The illustration shows REXONOLA No. 2, a popular Rexonola model, designed along dignified yet
graceful lines, constructed from the highest grade of imported oak, handsomely finished throughout.

Rossini’s “The Barber,” which must be
the Oldest Inhabitant in the Grand Opera
Co.’s repertoire, had a great revival in Mel-
bourne last week. Musically, it has always
been charming when orchestra and voices
have been equal to the occasion. From the
outset of the overture “The Barber” music,
light and dainty, is a winner. But the action
has not always been amusing—the comedy
is not necessarily comic from an Australian
point of view just because Italians handle
the old Italian libretto. It remained for the
co. at Melbourne Majesty’s to make the
gaiety of the story seem almost worthy the
sparkling flow of melody. Toti dal Monte,
as Rosina, looked her young and pretty little
self for the first time in her local stage life.
True, her Spanish antique dressing accentu-
ated her generous plumpness; on the other
hand it helped her winsomeness, the facial
inake-up of the smiling little artist being at
last satisfactory. And her warble! It was
• brilliant, fluent, sweet and decorative. The
highest of her high staccato notes touched
the dizzy limit in the singing lesson, where
she chose the old “Carnival of Venice,” with
variations —an item, by the way, which she
repeated at the Good Friday concert and
might have gone on singing for a week with-
out giving the house too much. Borgioli,
suffering from a sore throat, sang the
Count’s music pleasingly in half-pressure
tones, and acted the difficult character in a
happy, humorous mood. Ceresol was the
gayest of Figaros, his baritone sounding none
the less effective for not being big. Di Lelio,
assisted by a beautiful false nose built on the
lines of a lobster’s claw, made a capital
Basilio; while Azzolini, the broad buffo mem-
ber of the co., was often funny, though
usually excessive. Rossini’s delicate orches-
tration was tenderly handled by Paolantonio,
and the male chorus in the opening scene
gave the comedy a good kick-off.
Saturday’s matinee brought Alfred O’Shea
into the limelight, and introduced a satis-
factory basso (Gustave Huberdeau) as the
“SCROOGE” AT MELBOURNE
PALACE.
Ebenezer Scrooge (Seymour Hicks ) gives
his clerk, Bob Cratchill (Frank Dunn),
a severe talking to on the evils of a
merry Christmas.
Philosopher in “Bohfeme.” O’Shea, a J.C.W.
man ere he went to Italy for voice culture,
was the tenor here, of course, and under the
guiding care of Melba, who is singing the
sugary music even better than on the open-
ing night,-the young Australian tenor got
through the job with credit. As a vocalist he
is more essentially melodious than the three
more dramatic tenors who preceded him in
their appearances. His voice is of finer
quality. O’Shea is not John McCormack,
but he tends that way.
The versatility of Bizet, unluckiest of
innovationists, had justice done to it by con-
ductor Paolantonio and the orchestra when
“Carmen” came along on Saturday night.
Bizet’s score is so light in some places and
so unconventional in design that its claim
to “grandeur” was denied of old; yet it
wears well. It had a great reception on
Saturday, although Aga Lahoska, in the
name-part, is no great singer—contralto or
mezzo—nor specially bewitching to the eye.
Her voice has more wobble than sympathy
or fire, and only in her brief duct with Esca-
millo in the final scene did she suggest capa-
city for sweeter and warmer tones. At this
first appearance her voice was probably not
on its best behavior. Her acting, however,
would cover more deficiencies than can be
charged against her. Her art is subtle. She
lives the part. Her every gesture is an in-
terpretation. Piccaluga’s realistic Don Jose
offers no apology for the devilment of Car-
men. Here is a good fellow, his brain
“THE GARDEN OF ALLAH” AT
SYDNEY ROYAL.
Father Roubier (Leslie Victor ) talks of
faith to Domini (Muriel Starr).
turned by the minx from the tobacco-factory
who has to go temporarily insane before he
can kill her in a convincing manner. Jose’s
faithful Micaela has an only passable repre-
sentative in Augusta Concato, the “Butter-
fly” lady. The part is unsuited to her
soprano, nor is there aught of the i rustic
innocent about her, save two Margueritian
plaits and an occasional droop of thq head.
Apollo Granforte seems anxious not to give
the Toreador the undue importance often
given to him, and among minor considera-
tions the Melbourne Couservatorium girls,
Rose Pinkerton and Doris Mclnnes, cut
pretty figures as Carmen’s leading friends.
But they are hardly the stuff that tobacco-
factory girls are made of, and as units in
the smugglers’ gang they looked too lady-
like for lawlessness. Vocally they lack
strength, but are full of music. In Bizet’s
busy opera, chorus and scenic setting can
make or break the show, and in this case
they make it notable. The men are valu-
able, and the Australian girls who roil cigars
in old Seville err only on the side of gen-
tility. There is ginger in their demonstra-
tiveness, as well as gold in their voices, but
a fuller meed of vulgarity can only come
with experience. An interesting perform-
ance all round, and so rich in detail that
each repetition should be an improvement
on its predecessor.
“Tosca” has dropped out of the Melbourne
programme: it breathed its last on Tuesday
this week. “Otello,” “The Barber,” “Car-
men,” “Rigoletto” and “Bohbme” ai’e still
in the running, and “Trovatore” will enter
the field on Saturday.
“Little Nellie Kelly” closes down at Mel-
bourne Princess’s on Friday, and a brief
return of “The O’Brien Girl” will ensue.
These last few nights of long-lived Nellie
have given clever Mary Gannon another
chance to'exercise her local talent in a lead-
ing part. Previously she was deputy for
Ena Dale when Ena was sick, but this time
she has taken the place of Mamie Watson,
talking with the same angel accent as the
other girl, and singing more skilfully in a
cultured light soprano.

At Melbourne Palace the restless hand-
play of Seymour Hicks continues to speak
for itself in the risky story of the Lady, the
Lover and the Sleeping Draught. Also the
tactical error of preceding “Sleeping Part-
ners” with “Scrooge” instead of reversing
the order of things remains as evident as on
the first night.

“The Cabaret Girl” ministers to Mel-
bourne’s wants at the Royal, as before.
At Melbourne Tivoli the Easter offering
is Bert Coote. Bert and his surroundings
have restored the reputation of a vaudeville
which was somewhat impaired by the boost-
ing of two musical clowns whose clowning
often threatened to be musical, but never
got there. The Big Four are musical. Not
novel in conception, but melodious in result.
“Woman to Woman” is near its end at
Melbourne King’s, and next Saturday Ger-
trude Elliott will reappear as an old man’s
dream in “Smilin’ Through.”
In “Where the North Begins,” at Mel-
bourne Majestic, the old, old types fly to
their weapons in a struggle for the nicest
girl, while a dog of strength and sagacity
figures in some exciting situations. “The
Broken Wing,” on the same bill, starts off
well by dropping an airman into the middle
of a Mexican revolution ; but the rest of the
yarn is hackneyed. Hoyt’s ask their cus-
tomers to take their chome between “Sport-
ing Youth” and “Her Reputation.” Both
are equally regardless of probability, but
most sympathv will be aroused by the second,
wherein a ruthless reporter hunts down an
inuo-cent gyurl for the details of a murder
which he alleges she committed. “The Gold
Diggers” are now striking payable ore at
the Britannia, and “Gold” is also in demand
at the Melba. In the latter there is a parade
of passions which the advt. describes as
“elemental.”

Two little shows in Melbourne:—
Most of Carl Hampel’s pictures at the Decoration
Gallery are the sort of things that enchant the
orthodox; but the writer prefers the works of Ham-
pel’s earlier period when he set down faithfully
what he saw, and produced dawns, twilights and
glum winter afternoons that looked like actual bits
of Nature cut out and framed. Nos. 43 and it
are examples of his past; No. 4 may have been
produced later, but it is an advertisement of the
same method, ana these three command attention in
an otherwise middling exhibition.
Leila Bothroyd’s work at the Fine Art Society’s
Gallery strikes one as the old Blamire Young form
of poster art translated into water-color. Here we
have simplification into flat effects by broad sten-
cillings of light and shade, which can be singularly
arresting, as witness the lady’s view of Swanston-
street on a wet day. The artist’s success in this
picture is conspicuous. A sidelong glance at the
Town Hall is another good attempt to clarify a
scene by ignoring inessential details; but there are
examples—No. 14 is one —where the massed shadow
becomes an ungainly blot on the illustration. How-
ever, the general effect of Miss Bothroyd’s street-
scapes is appealing. It is when she is compelled to
draw upon other technical resources that the meagre-
ness of her equipment is revealed.
There is no visible slackening in the
whirl of merriment over “Tons of Money”
at Sydney Grand Opera House. The lively
piece is in its eighth week.
At Her Majesty’s, Sydney, “The Maid
of the Mountains” has hosts of admirers at
her feet. Gladys Moncrieff, Claude Flem-
ming, Robert Chisholm and the rest make up
a cast of diverse talents and more than
average merit.
At Sydney Cri. events are still working
up to the climax where a scandalised parson
complains of having been called a old
fool, and a very frank nobleman pertinently
inquires “Aren’t We All?”
Signor FARINETTI, stage-director of the
Melba-Williamson Grand Opera Com-
pany, shows the ladies of the chorus
how to do it.
“The Garden of Allah” continues to give
Sydney Royal patrons an opportunity of
seeing dawn rise over fclie Sahara, and
Muriel Starr torn between love and religion,
and* Frank Harvey renounce the world. All
for a very moderate cash. outlay—with
liberal helpings of Algerian scenery thrown

The remodelled Palace (Sydney), opened
on Saturday with “Aladdin,” is a credit to
the architect aud the Firm. But if it is
not too late to add to the specifications,
these few details which have been over-
looked might be attended to —totally demol-
ish (by blasting if necessary) that portion
of the pantomime known as Hector St.
MELBOURNE HIS MAJESTY’S. GRAND
OPERA SEASON—“MADAME
BUTTERFLY ”
Luigi Cilia as Goro, the marriage broker.
Alfred Maguenat, as Sharpies, the American
Consul, has a whisky to music.
Clair, who obstructs what is otherwise a
good show; remove (as painlessly as pos-
sible) that section referred to as The Nitos,
who are out of place in the panto; paint out
a few suggestive parts which don’t harmonise
with the surroundings and are unnecessary ;
add a little more of the ballet, which is
one of the most popular sections; finally, if
the demolition of Hector aforementioned is
complete, remove the remains. With these few
alterations and additions, the panto will be
passed for payment. Ada Reeve makes a
bright and likeable Aladdin, and things move
merrily while she is about. The Widow
Twankey, who keeps the laundry, is a cheery
old lass,_ and Tom Payne misses no oppor-
tunity with the part. A newcomer, Hope
Charteris, the Princess, has a pleasing voice
and manner, and should be very popular.
And the Asylum Scene, with George Welch
and Gus Bluett in the principal parts, is
the maddest thing that ever was, and keeps
the house rocking with laughter. This and
the ballet are the brightest spots in what
could, and no doubt will, be made an exceed-
ingly bright show.

Having gathered in Florence Smithson,
who has nightingaled in Drury-lane, Sydney
Tivoli is content. The tastefully-frocked
newcomer gives an artistic touch to an im-
proved bill, and sings of love and roses with
such tear-stained tenderness that soulful
sighs from hand-clasped couples are plainly
audible when the music softens. Her Cock-
ney impersonations, admirably restrained,
are going to be very popular. Jay Laurier
confirms the first good impression he made;
and animal-mimic Carr Lynn and the
legeentricities of Renie Riano are doing their
share in harvesting the Easter shillings.

Vernon and Fred Hughes are giving pickings
from comic opera between films. At the
Lyric Wintergarden, where babies can be
parked while mum grows mushy, there is
Tom Mix in an affair that mingles afforesta-
tion with the evil that men do. The pro-
ducer has tinkered with the finish of Kip-
ling’s “Light that Failed,” which the Globe
and Empress are handling. The Society for
the Abolition of Happy Endings has it on
its list. The “Mother-in-Law,” at the Strand,
is keeping her fickle daughter-in-law from
stepping out of bounds. Hoyt’s have a pair
of passable holiday attractions. “The
Shock” is all that can be desired in the way
of intrigue, and “Slippy McGee” is the story
of a crib-cracker Avho loses a leg and gains
a soul. “Nero” is unmovable from the
Crystal Palace.

That’s because the McClary Range “stores” heat, on the same principle
as the fireless cooker or the baker’s oven.
Roasting requires considerable time, as does heavy baking. Once
McClary’s Electric Oven is thoroughly heated the current may be turned
“off,” and the “stored” heat will bake bread, cakes, pies, or roast
fowl or meat while the mistress of the kitchen goes shopping, or attends
to other duties away from the kitchen. Ihe same principle obtains on
the hot-plate or boiling surface, where McClary’s protected Tor-Red
elements hold the heat with the current “off.”

Sweep Away Wrong Ideas
About Electric Cooking.
Electric cooking is no longer a fad or in the experimental stage.
McClary’s Electric Range makes it an everyday fact, with some
extraordinary advantages in the way of cleanliness, cheapness and
appetising cooking.
McClary Electric Cooking—Appetising
and Tender.
This Range delivers more food. The loss in weight from ordinary
cooking is two or three times more than when electrically eooked.
Meats and viands do not shrink or harden, but retain their
natural juices and salts. This is owing to the oven being hermeti-
cally sealed and not requiring air for combustion.
McClary Cooking, Cheap.
With current at reasonable prices per unit in the leading cities
and'towns the McClary Range is economical to run. So much
of the cooking can be done on “low” and “off.” “Stored” heat
pays for the Range.
Cool McClary Kitchens.
A lady writes. “No heat is felt from the Range with all current
full on, a great consideration in the Summer; another advantage
is saucepans do not get a scrap dirty on the outside.”
Coolness is a great consideration in many City Cafes and Tea
Rooins, where cooking is often done in a confined area, owing to
the value of space.

“Pedro”: Mrs. Brown Potter, who also
tried to be La Tosca, used to crawl, scared
and sinuous, about the stage when preparing
Scarjpia’s last costume. Up in N. Queens-
land public opinion boggled at this little
ceremony, and one night a citizen protested.
“After killin’ the poor old bloke yer goin'
ter lay ’im out!” he yelled from the gallery,
amid applause. Mrs. Potter was perturbed,
and sought counsel of Pete Hughes, .busi-
ness manager for the occasion. “Yes.” said
that oracle, “won’t do up here, will it?”
Then he had an inspiration. “Cut it out,”
he advised; “jus’ stick him.” “And after
that?” asked Cora. “Affer ye’ve stuck him
jus’ sneak off.” And thereafter she just
stuck him and sneaked off.
“G Major”: Next to Melba, the most
experiericed artist in the opera co. is Gus-
tave Huberdeau, the French basso. The
fact that he has sung with Mary Garden,
Emmy Destinn, Tetrazzini, Galli-Curci,
Caruso, John McCormack, Battistini, Sam-
marco and Scotti is' a diploma of the first
order. He has undertaken 110 different
parts in Italian, Russian, German and
French opera, and is one of the few who
know all the Wotan roles in the music-
dramas of Wagner. He was in the first-
performances of “Parsifal” and “Pelleas et
Melisande” in Paris, where he sang at the
Opera Comique for 10 years. Melba brought
him here specially to appear as Colline in
“Boheme.” He had impressed her with his
qualities when he did the part with her at
Covent Garden, and he had also appealed to
the ear of Puccini at a Parisian performance
which the composer conducted. Throat
trouble on the way to Australia kept the
distinguished veteran from opening in
"Boheme” ; but his voice, now in good order,
will make its weight felt in other produc-
tions.
“Percy Piano”: Reading of the lady who
has insured her legs for a vast sum, I was
reminded of Serymbal Pfutz, the famous vir-
tuoso of the Manchurian zither, who claimed
that w public-spirited company would - dis-
sever itself from £25,000 if he lost one or
more of his precious fingers. To convince
the incredulous, Pfutz had the policy photo-
graphed and an alleged facsimile inserted
in various papers. People marvelled at the
size of the gamble the company was
taking on, but I happen to know that the
policy contained a safety clause which was
concealed from the camera’s eye. The clause
ran somewhat as follows:
This company only agrees to pay the insured the
sum mentioned herein in the event of his damaging
or losing his fingers by frost-bite when searching for
edelweiss on Mount Everest on the seventh Sunday
in the months of January, February and December.
“0.K.”: “Madame Butterfly” was first
produced in Melbourne some 14 years ago,
when Bel Sorel and Amy Castles alternated
the name-part. Sorel was the more ani-
mated actress; Amy had the finer voice.
Both were surpassed later in the season by the
charming Pampari. She had an advantage
in that she was going to marry the Italian
tenor Zerga, who was inspiringly jealous of
his little girl. Jeanne Brola was the Butter-
fly of both the Quinlan companies, and
Mabel Dennis was a strikingly effective
Susuki in each case. The range of Mirais
in “Boheme” has been wider. First c*e
Bassich, with the Italian eo. that introduced
the opera to Australia. Lalla Miranda and
Brola sang the part with Quinlan’s first and
second companies, and meanwhile Pampari
had sung it in Sydney prior to Amy Castles
doing it by Yarra’s banks. But Pampari
did not repeat her Sydney success in Mel-
bourne. Her Zerga got himself fish-
poisoned, and because he could not play
the lover he forbade her to play Mimi. Re-
luctantly obeying her jealous tenor, she
broke her engagement to the J.C.W. firm,
and forfeited the price of her return fare
to Naples. Italian singers are generally
more prudent where cash is concerned.
“Orb” : On the last night of George Rig-
nold’s production of “Julius Caesar” at Syd-
ney Majesty’s, everyone who bought a ticket
was given a numbered voucher for a lottery
of the two white bulls that nightly walked
in the procession in Act I. This excellent
idea deserves encouragement to-day, as it sub-
stitutes a sporting element for the over-
worked heart-interest. Fancy taking the.
new typiste to see Oscar Asche, for instance,
and then coming home with a camel to pla-
cate the missus!
“T. 0.1.” : Tenor and teacher Percy French,
who went out at 52 a few- days ago, was a
son of the late Henry French, of the Sydney
Stock Exchange and. one-time draper on
Old South Head-road. He was organist to
seven M asonic Lodges, and o’ Sundays was
soloist at the Church of •Christian Scientists.
His widow is a daughter of the late Robert
Nall, of the Daily Telegraph, and sister
of Dorothy, who recently went to India to
fulfil a matrimonial engagement.

“Oh, I can’t stand him — he’s an awful flat!”
“Yes, but he’s got a motor-car and two thou-
sand a year—what you might call a flat
with every modern improvement.”
“0.K.,” looking backward :
“Antipholus” (B. 13/3/’24) ■ is mistaken in saying
that Alfred Dampier played Othello and lago alter-
nately with George Milii at the old Melbourne Opera
House in 1889. Miln was Othello in the first in-
stance, while Nat Douglas did lago, and then,
when Miln wanted to try his luck as lago (which,
after all, is a better part than the dusky one for
most actors), he got old Bill Leake to play Othello.
But in his references to Greenaway in this company
“Antipholus” is quite all right. Greenaway was
Cassio in 1889, so his Cassio with Asche the other
day was a young, man of 35 years’ experience in
the part; he was also Horatio in “Hamlet” and the
Duke of Buckingham in “Richard the Third.” It
w r as not the only Duke of Buckingham he played
at that time. Miln dropped out of the bill to make
way for his, friend Edwin . Thome (brother of
Charles Thorne) from America, who staged a drama
called “The Royal Guard,” adapted from “The Three
Musketeers.” Herein Greenaway was another Duke
of Buckingham. Old Jimmy Cathcart was a stagey
Cardinal Richelieu to Thorne’s D’Artagnan in the
same play, which is what “Antipholus” is thinking
of, perhaps, when he says Miln staged Bulwer Lytton’s
“Richelieu.” Anyhow, I have no recollection of a
“Richelieu,” though I saw all of Miln’s productions.
The only staging of “Richelieu” in Melbourne that
I can remember was done by Brough and Boucicault
for the benefit of their business manager, Alec Mayne,
himself an actor, who took the name part. Somebody
lately remarked that he couldn’t remember Green-
away doing notable work in modern drama. But
the slim, clean-cut identity figured most effectively
as, firstly, a young man, and subsequently a spirit-
less old has-been in “Milestones.” He was the
young man whose girl broke her engagement with
him in the first act and remained a regretful spinster
ever afterwards.
BARON SOLOMON, manager of the new
Green, Room Club, Melbourne, whose
glad hand is known to all Thespians in
Australia.
“Barnum II.”: After all. why shouldn’t
a star mummer, after enacting a vivid death-
scene op-the-stage,-come to life for a curtain-
call? I’ve known Charles Warner to perish
horribly in “Drink” and then appear before
the curtain in faultless evening clothes. If it
chanced to be a first night he would address
a few well-chosen remarks to an audience
that was “tickled to death.” ■ Again, why
not? Bernhardt once haughtily remarked
to a dramatic critic :' “Sir, we are artists,
not exhibitions!” But Sarah, though a great
dramatic artist, could beat Phineas T. at his
own game. In theatrical affairs talk as
much as you like about Art, but don’t forget
the Big Drum. -
“F.L.H.”: If “Pollio” had Australian
productions in mind when complaining (B.
10/4/’24) that the doll scene in “The Tales
of Hoffmann” is degraded to the level of
pantomime, he is rather unfair to the. first
Quinlan showing of Offenbach’s opera. I
saw that performance, and aver that Lalla
Miranda departed from the sliort-skirt-and-
socks tradition which “Pollio” laments; her
dress just showed her shoes. The part has
small acting possibilities, of course, but
Lalla cleverly exhibited all the symptoms of
collapse w-hen the works ran down. Any-
how, if the J.C.W. contingent put the opera
on as well as Quinlan’s crow T d did there w T ill
be no complaints.
“B.”: G. H. Mulcaster, who appeared here
in “Bulldog Drummond” and “The Faithful
Heart,” is showing his square jaw' in Wil-
liam Archer’s “Green Goddess,” at Lppdon
St. James’s. The ancient George Arliss has
the leading part, and for the first time in his
life Archer knows what it feels like tp be a
successful dramatist. His play is booming,
and the Firm is now looking in its direction
with a view to staging it in Australia. (,
“Ex-Englishman”: Adelaide’s Repertory
Theatre, on the Board of which Prof. Archi-
bald Strong has succeeded S. Talbot Smith
as chairman, gave two performances of
“Laughing Lady” as its first show for 1924.
Sutro’s play will live by two unforgettable
incidents. One is comedy, where Marjorie,
just divorced, though quite innocent, finds
herself sitting at dinner next to the K.C.
who that same afternoon had made her look
a liar in the witness-box. The other is essen-
tial drama. The K.C.’s elderly and devoted
wife comes. to beg Marjorie, with whom he
has fallen in love, to take him on her own
terms, provided she causes no scandal which
would damage his career at the Bar. Wilfred
Neill produced the thing, and his wife
(hitherto known as Kitty Sullivan) was a
memorable Marjorie.
' H.E.S. ’: Seymour- Hicks’s attention to
detail failed him on the opening night of
‘Scrooge.” When Hicks, as the old miser,
locked himself in his office for a comfortable
gloat over his cash-book, he turned the key
in the lock and then laboriously bolted the
door top and bottom. But after the tearful
peeps into the future provided by Marley’s
ghost, the frenzied old man rushed to the
door, and opened it by simply turning the
key. Love may laugh at locksmiths, but an
actor-producer can’t afford to ignore them.
“Second Murderer”: Howard Vernon
claimed to be the first comic-opera Rip Van
Winkle that Australia knew. Jefferson was
the great dramatic Rip, and J. C. Williamson
starred in the part. As Rip Vernon gave a
fine performance during a season at Mel-
bourne Opera House under the Dunning
management in the ’eighties, but by the time
he played the bibulous Dutchman at the
scratch venture at the Queen’s (the Alec)
in ’97 he was not equal to singing the exact-
ing solos, which were mostly deleted, the
concerted bits scored for Rip being trans-
ferred to a reliable chorister, Bob Fitzgerald.
After the operatic venture, Vernon struggled
on in melodrama. I forget what it was
in, but I heard him sing “Trust to Luck"
disguised as a broth of a bhoy.
“Auldtime”: About the last play the late
J. L. Toole produced in Australia, with
Irene Vanbrugh as leading young lady, was
11. J. Byron’s “Dearer than Life.” One of
the best of Byron stories deals with the first
production of “Dearer than Life” at a Lon-
don theatre, where both Henry Irving and
J. L, Toole were working for modest salaries.
Between the second and third acts there was
a horribly long delay, and while Byron
Mas walking about in mental agony at the
back of the d.c.. the wearied orchestra rest-
ing a moment, the sound of a saw was heard.
“I think they must be cutting out the last
act,” the author said.
“First Robber”: “O. Gidd’s” reference to
Carrie Moore’s singing “I Don’t Want to
Play in Your Yard,” in the “Djin Djin”
panto of long ago (B. 10 /4/’24), reminds me
that it was Carrie’s first appearance. Only
12 then, she indignantly refused to go on
with nothing more than tights to mask her
shapely legs. At the dress rehearsal she
wrapped a red cloak round her, and reso-
lutely refused to take it off, until J. C. Wil-
liamson effected a compromise; he had a
long cloak made for her in place of the
rather abbreviated coat which had been pro-
vided.
“Nix”: Australian girls get very small
parts in the grand opera. Different girls are
selected for the same little bit on different
nights. But the bits are so very small that
they don’t matter.
“Ex-Englishman”: Charles Collette has
died in London, at 82. He left the Army
over half a century back to marry Lady
Bancroft’s sister, and got some good chances
with that family on the stage. .... I saw him
at about his best, in the name part in Bur-
nand’s “The Colonel,” which satirised the
{esthetic movement at the same time, as
“Patience.” But Collette preferred light
parts which could work in a song or two.
As an author he made a hit with a farce in
which he always played the lead. It had
the fearsome name “Cryptoconchoidsyphonos-
tomata,” which is not really difficult if you
say it slowly.
“Banshee”: “Second Murderer” declares
(B. 27/3/’24) that George Bryant’s Abe
Lincoln in the Repertory production of Drink-
water’s drama in Sydney is the best thing he
has ever done. It may be so, but it must have
been magnificent to surpass Bryant’s poignant
picture of the strike leader in Galsworthy’s
“Strife.” In 20 years’ experience of the
theatre in this country I have never seen
anything so powerful as this conception of
the fanatical idealist boiling with purely in-
tellectual hatred for. the Capitalism he hopes
to destroy. Bryant’s strike-leader is the
forerunner of the modern Bolshevik of tin
best type, a blind, but pathetic, idolater of a
theory that has been proved a hopeless dream.
I went two or three times to see Bryant just
to watch his amazing facial performance. Jn
his countenance anguish seemed to be strug-
gling with mordant humor in his realisation
of the futility of the men behind him.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The front scene has gone
out of fashion among producers of modern
drama and melodrama. It might be revived
with advantage in the first act of “The
Garden of Allah,” where the audience, not
yet gripped by the play, is kept waiting for
minutes whilst the short second scene is
being “set.” The curtain is dropped again
for the setting of Scene 3. After all, intelli-
gent people go to see the play, not the
scenery.
“Lond” : A really good old play is better
than a goldmine. Running in London now
are “When Knights Were Bold,” nearly 20
years of age; “Charley’s Aunt,” over 30;
and “The Private Secretary,” just
Arthur Helmore, who “created” the Secre-
tary part and played it for a few weeks till
Tree and then Pen ley grabbed it, is still liv-
ing and in harness. " Charles Walenn talfes
it this year, till a new Gilbert-and-Sullivan
season starts.
“WHY WOMEN LOVE.”
[FOR THE BULLETN.]
The ice-cream boys ’ave sold their muck and gone,
The band gets busy, with the lights turned low,
’lding- the tabbies good to look upon;
Tis thus we reach the star film Of the show,
“Why Women Love,” a million-dollar play,
With palaces a-glitter in the sun,
And painted Flossies on the Great White Way,
Where Virtue drops ’er petals one by one.
The ’ero is a coot with iron-bound jaw,
Who loves ’is wife, but wants to make a pile
By ’elping wealthy crooks defy the law,
That ’e may pay in diamonds for ’er smile.
But. she, a woman with a neart of gold,
Who seeks no pleasure but ’is fond embrace,
Grows restless when she thinks lie’s turned, stone-
jold,
Then bites ’er lip and swears to go the pace.
And so she leaves ’im in ’is lawyer’s den,
And ’ops it with a blinkin’ millionaire,
Who shields ’er from the scorn of other men; ;
A nairship soon is scootin’ with the pair
Up to ’is castle in the boundless west,
Where love and ’appy laughter fill their days. A.
But in the silence, when ’is nibs finds rest,
She kneels upon the marble floor arid, prays,
’Er ’usband staggers when ’e learns the truth;
While wealthy clients find theirselves in gaol,
’/■: seeks distraction with the gilded youth,
And drops ’is bundle on the slipp’ry trail;
Some slashin’ tabbies lure ’im with their song;
Off ’Ell the bootleg whisky lifts the lid ;
Dead broke, to keep ’is end up with the throng,
’E writes ’er lover’s name for fifty quid.
Next morning finds ’im in ’is cheerless room,
With bony fingers ’ooked around ’is eheild,
Loud in ’is ears there roars the voice of doom ;
But Emmaline is pure and unde-filed- —
Kr lips keep movin’ as she strokes ’is ’air,
To stop ’im thinking of a life in quod.
“’Ow could she leave ’im for a millionaire?
O God, send back me mammy—do, please God.”
Silent : she rises from ’er gilded couch;
Barefoot she passes through the trackless snow,
Where, bears and croekerdiles and lions crouch,
Who growl uncert’in as they let ’er go;
For ’ov’rin’ near there shines a -nangel’s face,
And silver wings is flappin’ up above,
Which bear ’er swiftly to ’is fond embrace...,
’Ow many learn —too late !—Why Women Love !

The
ELSA
Hammerless
The latest B.S.A. Hammerless Gun embodies every essential quality required by the Australian shooting man. Whether it be
for trap-shooting, duck, quail, fox, rabbit or other game, the B.S.A. gun has proved itself superior to other guns at more than double
the price, hitting harder, throwing a better pattern, and on actual performance creating an entirely new standard of gun value.
B.S.A. Hammerless Shot Guns can now be obtained from all recognised gun dealers in the following models:—
B.S.A. Standard Model, blued action, plain rib, pistol grip 14 guineas
B.S.A. Model>de-Luxe, blued action, engine turned rib, vulcanite butt plate, pistol grip 15 guineas
B.S.A. Model-de-J ,uxe Ejector Gun, blued action, engine-turned rib, butt plate, pistol grip 20 guineas
These models have been specially designed for Australian conditions and can be supplied with cylinder and choke, modified and full choke, or both full choke
barrels. All barrels chambered for 2 fin. cartridges.
NOTE.—The action and locks of the B.S.A. Hammerless Gun are claimed to be the strongest in the world, rendering any form of cross-bolt entirely
unnecessary. The B.S.A. Gun has killed the crossbolt ”fetish” for good.
AN ALL-BRITISH PRODUCTION.—The B.S.A. gun is manufactured throughout at the world-famous B.S.A. works,

WITH each improvement in mode
of travel, civilisation has been
advanced—the steamship supplant-
ing the sailing vessel; the railway
locomotive displacing the stage-
coach; and the automobile super-
ceding the horse-drawn vehicle.
For 72 years, it has been Studebaker’s
privilege to take an important part
in supplying dependable transpor-
tation — first in the form of horse-
drawn vehicles; today, in the man-
ufacture of six-cylinder motor cars
of the highest quality.
See the 1924 Studebaker Cars before you buy; 13 models
all “sixes”—all quality-built.

Axles —because of the ease with which vehicles fitted with them can be hauled —

the redeeming of capital by selling horses and waggons put out of use because
of the bigger and easier hauling resulting ih less waggons being needed.
With SKF Ball-Bearing Axles fitted, the life of both horses and waggons you

R..T.A.: The yarn goes heavily. All yarns
do which suggest that a whole district is peopled by
idiots A.W.V.K.: “Ideas” not bright enough....
K. Junior: It isn't convincing. J.S.T.: No use
here lor long, loose yarns of 12,000 words... .H.C.H.:
Sorry, but they mis'-:.... Eunice T.: Too slender....
A.K.C.: tHt.’t remember it Mag: It is not verse
at all—. D.l’.M.: The note is too hysterical. People
don’t stand weeping because a season changes
Marjorie 8.: “[n--pir.ition'’ hasn't any of it.
P.Q.Ih: IV. tty c.M and crude thinking... .A.W.J.E.:
Though far fill' the pub they are somewhere on the
track DR. (Orange): Not strong enough
Roland: Nothing in it.... Commonplace
interspersed with nonsense... .S.O’S.: No use....
R-F.K.; The octave is weak....Bellerive: Its tender
appeal will reach many hearts:—
A budding boil upon the neck,
A pimple on tne nose,
Swollen gums and hollow teeth
Are tributes to life s woes.
Distressing is a bilious head,
But the torture of the rack
Is the fury of rheumatics
When it lodges in the back.
A doctor ordered me to shun
Eggs, bacon and sweet cakes;
Restrictions are of no avail
To fierce rheumatic aches.
I’ve tried a lot of remedies
The tn my to foil,
Nightly rubbed my tender bones
With eucalyptus oil.
What’s the use of worrying?
I’ve learnt to grin and bear,
Smoke my pipe, and write a poem,
To drive away dull care.
.... Fan: “Transition” doesn’t convey what seems to be
its meaning... .W.M.8.L.: “The Toast” is too slight
in matter and the opening stanza is a mad confuskn.
... .James S.: Even an insult can be written withouc
that amount of crudity ...Admirer: Too weak in the
legs... .H.P.C.: The verse isn't strong enough to
carry it through Hope P.: Too slight and ps
frail as a jazz hound's promise... .Nui: Far too raspy
for the little it has to say.... Miss J.: They don't
get n ar... .W.I.R. and A.M.R.: Not the meat for
this pie.... David St. C.: No use here.... W.E.8.:
“Faith” doesn’t make much of a yarn. And it is
so ugly.... 0.T.L.; The tale hasn’t enough grip....
H.C.E.H.: Makes very dull verse W.G.P.: Lame
in both thought and handling K.M.: The “Birth-
right” yarn is not fresh and the handling is only
fair.., .W.M.8.L.: “Haunted” is spoiled by the
shortage of rhymes M.F. (Balnarring) : As rough
as a bush shanty... .L.P.H.: Your poem seems cnly
to rhyme by accident. A telephone directory does
that much.... Caller H.: A pleasant little twitter.
. ...T.E.W. : The mirth is too well hidden.... Freda
K.: You might write something if you were not so
determined to repeat the words and phrases of other
people.... Frank M.; The movement is wooden and
the verse says very little.... H.H. (North Sydney):
“The Southerly” must blow back... .L.L.: “The Out-
posts” are rather noisy without getting to much.
Norman F.; It won’t pass Elena: Bad in more
patches than it is g00d.... Elevationist: Our poor
old bones ached by the time we had finished it... .
A Sinner; The feeble thing could hardly get to the
basket....G. du C.: Nothing there.... Disgusted:
Too weak even to plead for forgiveness.... Cadenza:
The verse isn’t bright enough to carry the small
point H.H.M.; Not enough in it; but quite well
done Tarquin: Be natural. You surely don’t talk
like that... .N.E.S.: Says nothing fresh... .Heydeu:
All that matters could be put into 20 lines....
Esmond: Ah, that one arrived before the Armistice.
... .H.T.: Hardly worth space... .C.H.A.N.: The
man who wrote that is not in Pitt-street, but much
further west than you are. .. .R.R.: Variation of
very ancient yarn... .Mombak: The splendid vigor
of the ballad gives it almost an epic fragrance:—
“You gouty old brute, I want your daughter;
Five years I’ve lost her, five years I’ve sought her;
Of refusing me you have no hope.
I know where she is, and we’ll elope.
“Five years you’ve triumphed, but this very day
I’ll have your daughter, or you I will slay.
You cannot divert the course of true love;
You cannot keep me from my turtle dove.”
“Young man, get out, or I’ll have to use force;
You never will get her, except o’er my corpse;
Your calling is low, for sheep you do fleece;
Get out of the place, or I’ll call the police.”
“My God!” he said, “You twitting me so,
And saying a shearer is extremely low— _
•You!!! Who have spent three years in clink,
And around low hotels always'slink.
“I’ll keep my promise, I’ll slay you here;
And then I will flee with my loving dea-r,”
He drew a revolver, sighting at his head.
A crack and a thud, and the old man was dead.
. ...L.M.J.; We can’t issue you a poet’s license on
that sample Susan N.: No good. .. .F.J.F.: The
“Revenge” works too tediously to its point... .M.A.
(St. Peters): Far too slight... .Britomarte: Did
you hear that dull, sic kening thud ? Adam S.:
Don’t follow you. What is the point as to that Sea
Island cotton patch F. Font (8.H.): You pro-
duce nothing new H.H.: “Class Conscious” hangs
on too small and remote a h00k... .Post-and-Rails: ”
You carry a fine collection of moss, anyhow....
Kathleen M.: Doubt whether the quality of the book
is! fixed by the quotations. And it is pretty old, any-
way.... P.C. (M.L.): “Romance” is very close up;
biit it travels on rather well-worn rails Matlock:
Rough as a yearling colt, but worth an hour’s work
with the currycomb.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
L. ; If he has got only that far at 26 there’s
not much hope... .C.J.R.: Stiff drawing and limp
gags... .F.W.M.; Not up....J.P.: An ancient smell
about them both... .A.E.: Not a vestige of improve-
ment. .. .N.E.H.: Drawing woefully uneven... .J. A.:
Get somebody to explain to you the value of light
and shade K.F.: Doesn’t strike fire .J. 8.8.:
Sort of picture puzzle, isn’t it?.,..E.M.: Poor chap
with the amputated leg going home L.L.: A
woman like that could never have been invited to
the Golf Club dance, surely ! . H.M.N.: Both miss.

are adding, day by day, to the burdens and

UGHTS AND BUMPERS
The quality and design of this famous equipment serve to indicate,
a thorough knowledge of the practical needs of motoring—both
“commercial” and “pleasure.”
Though all are of the usual distinctive STEWART finish, they are
made primarily to give long years of faithful service in the work
they have to do.
The STEWART STOP SIGNAL is a
wonderful convenience in crowded city-
traffic. Automatically, with the operation
of the foot-brake for stopping or slowing,
the Red Hand flashes a warning to any
vehicle approaching from the rear.
There is no danger of neglecting to indi-
cate, and none of the inconveniences of
hand-warning.
The SPOTLIGHT is invaluable for safe
and comfortable night driving. The
STEWART STANDARD LIGHT is
favorite with Motorists the world over
on account of its convenience, wide light-
ing range and powerful rays. It is hand-
somely finished in black enamel, has
silver-plated reflector, and is fitted with
rear-view mirror.
The STEWART MINIATURE DE LUXE
SEARCHLIGHT is easily the most exqui-
site Spotlight made. Being only 4in.
in diameter and of beautiful nickel finish,
it adds wonderfully to the appearance of
any car. It is capable of throwing a
powerful beam of light in any direction.
STEWART BUMPERS, Double and
Single rail, are certain safeguards against
damage from bumps or collisions. They
are made of high-grade carbon spring
steel, specially treated, which makes them
so tough as to be practically unbreakable.
They withstand the most severe knocks
without injury to themselves or car.
Stewart Bumpers are attractively designed
and finished. They are readily fitted to
front or rear.

The Attractiveness
of Flower Perfumes
true to their names is best appreciated
by those who are familiar with
Williams’
Talc Powder
Ideal for every Talc usage.
The powder is absolutely pure, and fine as
Talc can be. The perfume exquisitely marks
the personality of the user.
The hinged cover opens wide or closes
tight with a flip of the finger. No excuse for
leaving it open, letting the
powder spill or the perfume
evaporate.

“Urainao”: Four thousand Maorilanders
have gone or have pencilled their cabins for
the trip to the British Empire Exhibition.
If it costs them only £SOO apiece, this means
the flight of capital to the tune of £2,000,000
out of Maoriland —nearly as much as the
increased price of wool has brought to the
pastoralist recently.

“A.J.J.T.”: ’Ware a class of advertising
dentist who announces his readiness to supply
a full upper and lower set of teeth for a
guinea or two. When the customer seeks
to hold him to his undertaking, he is in-
formed that a better-priced set would be pre-
ferable —one ait, say, 10 guineas, and as the
dentist has usually by this time extracted
the teeth there isn’t much choice. But
should the patient insist on the guinea or
two-guinea set he is handed a full upper set
of loose teeth and perhaps a lower set also.
Herein lies the catch. Amongst dentists a
“full set’’ consists of the loose, unset teeth ;
a set made up (i.e., on a plate) is a denture.
* * * *
“Yardley”: That is an amazing statement
of “Blick” (B. 27/3/’24) that “any good
stationer will supply a Cumberland pencil
equal to the best Austrian or German.’’
The mainland of Europe never yet produced
graphite to compete with that mined at
Barrowdale, in Cumberland. It runs as
low as 4 per cent, of iron. Half a century
back, when I was engaged amongst litho-
graphic artists, no designer would use any
but a Keswick pencil, and the cost was equal
to an hour’s work of a printer. To-day people
would stare .if asked half a crown for a
lead pencil. Consequently the real thing
has passed almost out of memory, and few
know what a drawing-pencil should be like.
* * * *
“Anaf”: The Australian chemist’s shop,
under the stress of competition, is going the
way. of the American one. There are “phar-
macies” in Sydney where one may nowadays
obtain not only magazines, novels, stationery,
safety-razors, sweets and cigarettes, but even
collars, ties and handkerchiefs. There may
be a reason for this besides the very keen
struggle to show or increase profits. It is
becoming less and less frequent for the
chemist to be required to compound drugs
and chemicals, or to prepare the official
remedies of the British Pharmacopoeia; the
warehouse supplies him with almost every-
thing ready-made. It almost looks as if the
future will see the gradual disappearance of
the art of compounding and dispensing medi-
cines, owing to the increasing fondness of the
profession for prescribing the handy tablet.
“Morob” : Despite the law that forbids the
killing of paradise birds in Papua and the
Mandated Territories—even being in the mere
possession is punishable—the business in
plumes goes merrily on ; it is probable that
hardly a vessel leaves Port Moresby, Samarai,
Rabaul or Madang without a bundle of them
hidden somewhere. They are smuggled into
the Commonwealth—where they are a pro-
hibited import—and are subsequently re-
exported to Europe and the United States.
In addition there is a local demand for them,
many women in Australian cities owning
gorgeous feathers which they are not game
to wear openly, but reserve for private
views and family gatherings. Owing to the
largeness of the area, it is almost impossible
authority in New Guinea to .stop the
illicit hunting that goes on, and the attempt
to detect the feathers that are being smug-
gled out at the ports is proving a job beyond
the Customs officers.

“J.G.”: Forestry experts say that we are
on the verge of a famine in timber, and
especially in softwoods. Well, in Vic. there
must be millions of acres of treeless one-, two-
and three-chain roads, and nearly every acre
of it, except about half a chain in the centre,
could be used, for the growth of a great
variety of timber trees. Pines, spruces,
cedars and other softwoods grow very rapidly
in the highlands about Daylesford, Ballarat
Maeedon, etc., and if the roads were to be
planted with these trees quite a lot would
be ready for the mills in 20 years. As well
as providing timber there would be other
great advantages. Municipal councils would
be saved much cash through the trees pre-
venting erosion by floods; the adjacent land
would be rendered more fertile through the
breaks checking the torrid winds of summer
and the polar blasts of winter; the landscape
would be made more picturesque, and no
matter how dark the night or how sozzled
the traveller the roads would always be
discernible between the dark lines of‘trees.
\\ hi Ist millions of trees ot the commercial
varieties of softwoods could be grown south
ot the Dividing Range, a” great variety of
commercial hardwoods could be grown north
of it. b ranee before the war had hundreds
ot miles of road planted with trees, and is
now industriously re-planting in the war
zone Victoria, and, in fact, Australia,
should get a move on in fhe same direction.
TWO SIDES TO THE GRIEVANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETN.]
“In the Perth Arbitration Court it was submitted
in support of the hairdressers’ claim that a barber
often had to take a customer who had just eaten a
meal of onions.”
Friend, ere you sit within his chair
And bid the Barber cut your hair,
Or shave you with his weapon keen
Until your chin and cheeks be clean,
Be careful of what food you eat,
Avoiding onions with your meat
In every form. Let not a course
Of mutton served with fragrant sauce,
Or duckling stuffed, or rabbit stew,
With tell-tale taint your breath imbue.
And oh, dear friend, be careful, please,
To take no garlic alter cheese,
Nor let a rank tobacco smell
Around your guilty presence dwell.
From customers who fill the throne
Should no ill odors e’er be blown.
They are the Barber’s right alone.
’Tis his alone to reek of smoke
That stupefies the “hair cut” bloke ;
To eat brown onions with his meal,
And talk till victims’ reasons reel;
To yap till client’s cheek turns white—-
These are the Baroer’s special right;
Trench not upon his perquisite.

Rexona Soap for
Health and
Beauty
‘My motto is Rexona.”
—Miss DOROTHY BRUNTON.
*
juJHm
“Rexona Soap is absolutely wo:
tierful for the skin and hair.”
—Miss EELIE SHEEDY.
“I have much pleasure In recom-
mending Rexona Soap, for I am a
Rexona Girl and have used Rexona
Soap all my life.”
—Miss LILY MULLANY.
“Rexona Soap is worth its weight
in gold for the skin and hair.”
—Miss MADGE ELLIOTT.
Girls! You too, can
have the Loveliest Skin
and Hair by Using only
REXONA SOAR
That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot be
imitated can be obtained by regular use of Rexona Skin and
Facial Soap. Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert this influence.
Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry up the
skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the best of such soaps
can only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing and anti-
septic balsams as Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the value of which
in the treatment of skin affections is known throughout the
world.
Simply use Rexona Skin and Facial Soap regularly once or
twice a day and see if it does not quickly soothe and cleanse
the pores, lessen the tendency to pimples and leave the
complexion clear, fresh and velvety.
Be Pretty! Be Dainty! Be Attractive!
Be a Rexona Girl!

A. McGrath, who is retiring from the Tele-
graph Department, put in 45 years’ service.
Sticking seems to be a habit with the
McGraths. Ilis father was 50 years on the
mechanical side of the S. M. Herald, and
six other members of the family have spent
all their lives in the jobs in which they
started.
“Adamasous”: I’ll back Rockhampton
(C.Q.) to have more push-bikes per capita
than any other town in Australia. Every
second male and every tenth female there
go to and from work and do their errands
on a “grid.” In the lunch hour particularly
the streets are thick with bikes; even the
portly mayor pedals to his job.
“Double-six”: “H.K.’s” par (B. 3/4/’24)
about a South Sydney tabernacle which
adjoins a pub reminds me that in our ham-
let the church stands 100yds. from the
groggery: and I have known Bung, while
sitting 'iii his pew, to prick up his ears at
sounds of someone driving up to the pub.
then quietly tiptoe out of the church, serve
the traveller and pussyfoot back to his de-
votions again.
“P.C. 49” : In the late ’nineties a touring
co. perpetrated “East Lynne” in Boulder
( W.A.) Mechanics’ Institute. The “house"
(one only) panned out IS bob, and the co.
vamoosed by the last Coolgardie train,
owing, among other things, the rent. To-day
I saw the sole trophy of the hall caretaker’s
chase—the property baton flourished by P.C.
Bullock in the execution of his tremendous
duty. In odd corners of out-back theatres there
must be many such memorials of fly-by-
night touring shows. I wonder if any sar-
donic humorist has tried to make a collec-
tion of them.
“Arrenby”: It has already been printed
that the “Sentimental Bloke” film cost £900
to produce, and returned the Gaumoiit people
£50,000, they having bought the world's
rights. Now screenings of “The Dinkum
Bloke,” under its British title of “A Gentle-
man in Mufti,” have yielded over £30,000, if
London trade papers do not lie. This shows
again that a fine British market awaits the
Australian film-man when the tariff makes
regular production possible here. Provided,
of course, he turns out real Australian pic-
tures. and not dull imitations of U.S.
“crook” stuff or imbecile caricatures of the
cocky.
“Pat Bushie” : The other day one of the
big business firms of our Hunter River town
received a letter containing a money-order
for £12 with an intimation that it was in
payment of the writer’s mother’s account. A
request for further information elicited that
the writer was executrix of the debtor’s
estate, and in going through some old corres-
pondence she had found an account which
was unpaid, for goods purchased in 1SS6.
Having herself now mislaid the account, and
remembering the pounds item only, she re-
mitted that. With the receipt a nice letter was
sent, stating that the balance of 10s. 9d.
had been written off as discount. But this
amenity merely brought the 10s. 9d. by return
post, the sender expressing the opinion that
as the amount was long overdue discount
could not be expected.
“Hamfat” : In “The Term of His Natural
Life,” which we staged with a sea scene —
a “transparency” back-cloth showed the
Ilydaspes on lire —Horace Slackthirst was
Captain Blunt, who ordered the boats out to
the rescue. On the next night he was a
railway official in “East Lynne,” his main
duty being to announce that the railway via-
duct had given way, and to see that red
lights were waved as a warning to the im-
perilled express. Horace’s “bender” started
hours before “His Natural Life” began, and
by the time he was due to render assistance
in “East Lynne” he was well “shot.” But,
superbly self-confident, he tackled the job
as the stage-hands lumbered rollers about in
the background. “Graceshus heavensh !” he
declaimed. “The embankmensh given way!
The trainsh ’ll be —hie—wrecked unlesh _we
can shtop her! Burn a blue—hie —light
from the port bar—I mean bow! Lower
the boatsh ! Now, then —who volunteersh
to man ’em?” The crash and the black-out
arrived just in time to save the stage-man-
ager from apoplexy. No audible comment
on the muddled monologue came from the
audience—perhaps the voice of the stage-
manager cursing Slackthirst, and Horace’s
dignified rejoinder that never in his 45
years on the stage had he spoken a wrong
line, were mistaken for screams of anguish
from the wrecked train.
From a Library Lizard :—
I agree with “Whitehall” (B. 3/4/’24) that decent
libraries, private or otherwise, have almost disappeared
in and about Sydney. The late Norman McLaurih
had a fine one in his home in Macquarie-street, and
used to get it re-arranged every few weeks, so
many were the calls he made upon it. His library
was part of his life; but doctors who are familiar
with the “beautiful obliquities” of Sir Thomas
Browne and the rugged prose of old Burton of the
“Anatomy” are few and far between these days.
If you spouted Burton or Browne in one of the
clubs you would have to lunch by yourself in a
corner. Club tastes have veered to the “Sheepbreeders’
Annual” and the “Sporting Calendar.” The library
of N.S.W. Parliament has its good points, but wants
modernising. I noticed a full set of Bohn, and some
volumes of Voltaire, Brantome and Rousseau in
French; the place looked an ideal one for serious
reading and study about 10 a.m. II. D. McIntosh
had some weird examples of what Lamb calls “things
in books’ clothing,” and these were of the sort
usually to be found on the shelves of the medical
jurist, the psychiatrist and the neuropath. They
rested cheek-by-jowl with expensive editions of R.L.S.
(20 vols. at 42s. each), Hardy and Ruskin ( £30
second-hand). There were also to be found at Belhaven
some of the rarer works on Napoleon ; and two nice
sets of Jane Austen and Walter Pater were snapped
up at the sale by the distinguished statesman who
writes “Where I Stand in Polities,” probably with
the idea of polishing up his prose before spouting
in America. MeTntosh would have gone far in the
book-collecting line with about 15 years’ more prac-
tice : he had a real flair for a good thing, and was
prepared to go to any figure to obtain it. Gazing
at the expensive editions bound in full morocco
which rested in his gorgeous bookcases, l felt inclined
to tear some of the covers off to re-clothe my shiver-
ing folios. (P.S. —I don’t claim originality for this
remark.) The whole must have cost the owner over
£1200; and it fetched nearly that sum, but not
quite.

You can sail away from the rigors of the coming cold
months into the languorous northern tropics and spend
a few delightful weeks in those romantic Islands for
much less than you may think.
An outlay of 150 to 200 pounds sterling should be
sufficient for ail expense. This includes first-class fare,
Sydney to Honolulu and return, on an ocean liner; hotel
living in rhe Islands; inter-island cruises; a visit to the
ever-active yet always safe Volcano Kilauea in Hawaii
National Park; all necessary incidental expenses, and
the usual sight-seeing trips and recreational features.
The trip will take about two months’ time, allowing
you three or four weeks in Hawaii—though everyone
who can spare the time invariably stays there longer.
You’ll enjoy two weeks’ restful voyage each way and a
day’s sightseeing at Suva, Fiji, or Pago Pago, Samoa—
depending on the route selected.
Here is an adventure in holidaying! Warm sunshine;
your favorite pastimes and new ones: golf; tennis;
surf-riding and swimming at Waikiki; deep sea fishing;
exploring strange forests and mountains; Hawaiian
music, luscious tropic fruits and the color and fra-
grance of brilliant flowers.

[FOR THE BULLETN.]
W r HEN Captain John Michael Frce-
body, lately of the Honorable
East India Company’s service,
went to call upon Major-General Macquarie,
C. 8., upon the latter’s return from his long
reign as Governor of New South Wales, he
found his friend an older man than he had
expected. The strong, upright soldier was
still there—the broad shoulders, the straight
back, the rugged, manly face with its sun-
tanned skin and dark, kind eyes, the stiff
dignity and the air of uncompromising truth-
fulness —but there was something of weari-
ness in his expression, and something of dis-
appointment. A trace of the old, courageous
optimism was missing, a little of the en-
thusiasm gone. He had lost something of
the energy that had always seemed to Cap-
tain Freebody to be his most characteristic
quality. He looked tired. When, with his
slight limp, he walked into the sitting-room
of the apartments in St. James’s where he
and Mrs. Macquarie had installed themselves
upon their arrival in London, the General
seemed to Captain Freebody to be like a man
who felt that he had somehow failed to be
quite as successful as he had intended to be.
Just the suggestion of that—nothing more.
He greeted his visitor warmly. “My dear
John Freebody, how glad I am to see you !
’Twas kind of you to come to us so soon.
Mrs. Macquarie, I regret, has gone to Bond-
street a-sliopping—she will be disappointed
at having missed you. But you must come
and dine. Pray, seat yourself, Captain—l
will ring for some refreshment. Bless my
soul, ’tis nigh to 20 years since I last sailed
with you in the Cambridge. We were both
younger then, eh !”
“Twenty years, Colonel—l beg your par-
don, I mean, General. Why, so it must be;
but it does not seem so long as that. How
long have you been in New Holland, pray?”
,“A dozen years—a little over a dozen. •"
Yet it seems not so long. How they go—
the years, I mean—as we grow older! But
what of yourself, my dear Freebody? Are
you still commanding one of John Company's
ships? Not the good old Cambridge. I know;
1 read of her destruction by fire in Madras
Hoads—and. of course, of your own gallant
conduct. What one would have expected-
but very fine, very fine indeed. Pray, wliat
ship have you now’. Captain?”
Freebody shook his head smil-
ingly. “None, General—none. I have re-
tired. And I’ve something to tell you, though
I thought I might have had the pleasure of
surprising you with it in Sydney. Only
learned of your return a few days back-
soon after you landed. Read it in the Mokn-
ixg Post. Most delighted to see you again.
Dear me—all these years!”
“You hoped to see me in Sydney? Had
you an intention of taking a voyage to New
South Wales, then?”
Yes. And have still. But I am going
to aew Holland as a colonist—to live there.
,1,0 settle—you understand? A little legacy.
England’s too small for me. Your letters,
you know. Gave me a strong desire to see
the place—to take my chance there. You’ve
always said ’twas such a fine country, with
such a sure future. Then the money came
to me. ‘Gad,’ says I to myself, ‘that’s the
place for Jack Freebody. Can believe Mac-
quarie. Oh yes, I’m going out to Sydney
sailing at the end of the month. Came
to ask your advice.”
.^ IC n Uari " e regarded his old friend a little
wisttully, and did not speak for a moment
or two. Then he stood up and clapped him
on i( th e shoulder affectionately.
Good!” he said. “I am delighted with
L° Q ur , n ® ws . Yes. ’tis a fine country, and it
stands in need of men like you. Its future,
convinced, is well assured. You should

voice droned on until he was interrupted by
the return of Bellamy with wine and glasses
and little cakes with caraway seeds in them.
Macquarie came back from the South
with a start, and stifled a sigh as he turned
to till the glasses
“My good John Freebody,” lie said. “I am
more than delighted to learn your inten-
tions.” He handed a glass of Madeira to his
old friend, and raised his own to the yellow-
grey rectangle of the window. “Let us drink
to the New World —the New Britain that I
have learned to love so well and almost to
feel homesick for, even here at home.”
Captain Freebody stood up, and raised
his glass to his lips.
“Yes, a great country. Not yet fully
realised, my dear Captain, A gracious
country. Destined to be the home of free
men, who will breed a new race. A glorious
heritage is to come. I see it all. Smiling
pastures. Great cities by the seaboard.
Happy women and sturdy children. A great
destiny—a tremendous destiny. Impossible
to predict more hopefully. Were 120 years
younger I think I would go back there also.
My life’s work was done there. Maybe they
will remember Lachlan Macquarie—after
wards. I drink, good John Freebody—l
drink to the New World. God bless it—
always!”
With this benediction echoing in his ears
Captain Freebody sailed down the Channel
for the last time three weeks afterwards.
Macquarie came to Gravesend to bid him
farewell, and again drank a toast to the
New World, whose infant footsteps he had
striven to direct with all the wisdom of his
far-seeing brain, and all the affection of
“is kindly heart. A little sad he was, and
a little envious of Captain Freebody, for
he knew that he would never again see the
Aew World he had done so much to estab-
lish. He knew that his working day was
done.
* * * *
Captain Freebody stood upon the veran :
dah of his homestead at Macquarie Yale,
and contemplated his New World. In front,
across the creek, the high blue mass of
Bother Micky Mountain stood up against
the sky in a dignified fashion altogether out
of keeping with its name. To left and right
the she-oaks lined the winding course of the
Macquarie Ponds. Far down the valley the
faint blue contour of massive ranges, very
tar away, showed against the pale curtain of
the lower sky through a gap in the forest-
clothed hills, by which the Macquarie Ponds
found a way into the Hunter River.
John Michael. Freebody .had become
leaner, and had a look of having passed
through some strenuous years. And so, in-
deed, he had. They had whitened his hair,
and bent his back a little.
It is true that Government had granted
Ins domain to him in the first instance, but
lie had had to make it himself. Three years
ago it had been virgin forest. Now, he told
himself, it was a post of civilisation, well
within the outposts. And he had made it
But Mrs. John Michael lay beneath a cairn
on the lower slopes of Black Peter, and his
two children-'—a boy and a girl—were both
aea(a , They had been drowned in the flood of
, , ell ha(l away his first bark liuts,
foolishly erected in a bend of the Macquarie
Ponds. So he had well paid for what was
his, and whatever might be his. He had his
pride in what he had done, but it w T as a
pride that had been chastened bv very bitter
grief.
As lie stood there smoking an after-
breakfast cheroot, and gazing upon the lovelv
prospect that lay before him, he became
avvare that he was not alone- —became aware
0 - 11 a startling and surprising fashion.
Pit y'r ban’s above y’r head, ve auhl
deevil! he heard suddenly.
The voice that uttered the words was a
rough and peremptory voice, and, as Captain
I reebody turned his head, he saw that it be-
longed to a rough and insistent person with
flaming red whiskers, who stood by the
corner of the verandah; nearest to the stock-
yards, and covered him with a Tower musket.
John Michael Freebody was a brave man,
and knew himself to be such; but that un-
wavering round black hole in the barrel of
the musket was an argument in favor of
compliance with the rude request of the
hairy ruffian who had made it, and whose
steely blue eye was behind the foreshortened
length of the barrel, that none but a fool
would seek to controvert. He had never been
a ™ol, so Ins hands went up above his head.
(rin ye make ony ootcry, ye’re a dead
mon. Cap n Freebody. So keep it in mind,
an don t be for movin’ a wee step, whiles I
come up an’ search ye. Stand ye quite still,
noo!” ’
Keeping Captain Freebody covered with
the musket, the man climbed up on the
verandah, and walked towards him.
“Noo, Cap’n, I dinna want for to hur-rt
ye, forbye I named ye f’r an’ ‘auld deevil’ a
minit or twa syne. Ye’re a guid eneuch mon,

Hae ye a pistol aboot ye, by ony chance,
noo—or a wee knifey, or onything' might be
dangerous to a puir fellie on liis lansome,
like masel?
Angrily, Captain Freebody cursed the red
man. ‘D—n you! Had I a pistol you’d
not have set foot on this verandah, my
man. What the devil is this? What do you
ivant with me?”
“I'll tak’ y’r word aboot th’ pistol. Cap’n.
I want naething—naething at. all but y’r
honor s self.”
“Myself!”
“Aye, Cap’n Freebody. Ye must come wi’

already saddled y’r lior-rse ior ye, an’ where

Wise Mothers are
Never Without ZAM-BUK!
Unequalled for All Wounds and Sores.
Few articles are so indispensable in the home
as a box of Zam-Buk, which heals the skin and
drives pain and disease from the tissues in an
entirely unique way.
When Zam-Buk is applied to cuts, burns or
scalds, smarting pain is stopped, germ infection
prevented and the broken tissues speedily knitted
together. Zam-Buk soothes the burning irritation
of eczema, pimples and rashes; it goes to the root
of all such skin disease. It draws poison and
inflammation out of ulcerated and poisoned sores
and heals when nothing else can. Mothers every-
where find Zam-Buk invaluable for healing ring-
worm and children’s scalp troubles.
Children themselves like Zam-Buk because it is so cooling,
soothing and pleasant. Their elders value it still more highly because
it is also antiseptic, preventing poisoning and festering, and because
it is good for the tenderest skin.

“My little grandson, Tom,” says Mrs. Annie Hessey,
Union Street, Erskineville, Sydney, “had a nasty skin
eruption on his face and arms. What were at first only
small blisters gradually developed into thick, crusted
sores. These were extremely irritating and most difficult
to heal.
“Remembering that there was a box of Zam-Buk
somewhere in the house, I had it found out, and dressed
the sores with the balm. This soon extracted the pus and
bad matter and subdued inflammation. The crusts
softened, then came away altogether, leaving lovely
clear, soft skin.”
ZAM-BUK MEDICINAL SOAP is just the special
soap needed when the skin is being nursed back to health.
It affords the readiest means of securing a clear and
healthy skin and preventing unpleasant or disfiguring
p disease. 1/- per cake of all Chemists.
may trust him when he’s a-tellin’ ye thart
gin ye dinna step oot f’r the stable, quick
an’ lively the noo, he’ll fire a braw fistful o’
slugs into th’ sma’ o’ y’r back. Juist that.
Noo jnove ye along, Cap’ll—aboot face, an'
mar-rch.”
One glance at the red man’s cold blue eye
looking along the barrel of the musket, con-
vinced Freebody that McNab was a person
of great earnestness of purpose, whose word,
in this instance at anyrate, was to be relied
upon. So the curious procession moved
along the verandah, and. round the end of
the house to the stables.
Sunset found them many miles away from
Macquarie Yale —thirty at the lowest esti-
mate, the Captain judged. All day long
they had ridden through trackless forests, in
a direction that was roughly north-eastward
—up stony creeks to the head of their water-
sheds, over high divides from whose summits
were obtainable endless vistas of rolling-
indigo, purple and far-off ranges scarcely a
deeper blue than the sky—and now their
weary horses were stumbling along the bed
of a deep gorge that seemed to lead into a
perfect chaos of beetling hills. Tall cliffs
overhung a boulder-strewn creek-bed, where
swirling and foaming waters tumbled noisily
through an arcade of dark-leaved trees and
hanging supple-jacks. Never, thought Free-
body, had he been in such a lonely, desolate
and primeval place.
All day long McNab had ridden a horse’s
length behind his prisoner, his muskjet on his
thigh, and always with a watchful eye upon
him that gave the Captain no chance what-
ever of risking a dash for liberty. Nothing
would induce him to talk, or give Freebody
any inkling as to why or where they travelled.
*‘Ye’ll know all aboot it come nielitfall.”
he grunted in reply to the Captain’s often-
repeated request for enlightenment. ’‘Dinna
fash yersel’, guid mon. I keen weel whaur
we’re gaun—an’ that's eneuch fo;r ye. Tak’
what comes when it conies. An’ mak’ no
trial for to get away—else y’r a daid corpse,
an’ nane th’ wiser o’t.”
So,. with hardly stifled indignation, the
owner of Macquarie Yale had perflorce sub-
mitted to his kidnapping. He had known of
Donald McNab, for a long time now, as one
of those runaway-convict bushrangers who
infested the outskirts of the civilisation that
was gradually pushing northward along the
valley of the Hunter. Once, he had formed
one of a party that had pursued McNab hotly
into these same unknown fastnesses —or into
some so like them that he could s/ee no dif-
ference—bent upon the destruction of the
gang of cattle- and horse-stealers he
organised and controlled with a skill and
enterprise that had made havoc among the
flocks and herds of the pioneers. Bu.t he had
escaped, as he always escaped, and they had
had to abandon the chase, only thankful that
they were able to find their way omt of the
almost impenetrable fastnesses of the net-
work of ranges and ravines into which he
had led them.
For a while Freebody had entertained a
notion that his capture in the morning had
some measure of revenge in it. but this idea
had, somehow, changed into one that McNab
required his services in some fashion or other.
Perhaps it was a question he had been asked
sometime about mid-day that led him to
think this.
“Ye’ll be a magistrate o’ th’ Territory,
I’m thinkin'. noo?”
“I am,” he had replied. “Why?”
“I juist was wantin’ for tae know it.
Hide on, mon—we’ve a far bit for tae ride
'yet. an’ th’ day’s wastin’.”
Quite suddenly, just as it was growing
dark, they came to the end of the gorge,
and rode into an amphitheatre in the moun-
tains that was the most open piece of country
the Captain had seen since they had turned
into the ranges. And a little way within
the opening was a stockyard and two huts,
through whose open doors came a gleam of
firelight. Dogs ran out and barked at them,
and a voice hailed them.
“Ha’ ye got him, Donald?”
“Aye, Jamesy, sauf an’ soond. D’ye come
an’ tak’ tli’ horses, whiles I tak’ him inside.
Hoo’s the ither?”
“Aw. he’s well enough, barrin’ his sulks.
But he’s reasonable now. He’ll do what lie’s
asked. What like of trip had ye?”
“Och, quiet an’ pleesant! Cap’n, I’ll
trouble ye for tae dismount, an’ come inside.
There's nae harm intended till ye. ’Tis but
a sma’ thing I’m askin' ye for tae do. A
mere bit o’ magist’reel for-rmality.”
He motioned Captain Freebody towards the
smaller of the two bark lints, still carrying
the musket in the crook of his arm ; and
the Captain went in.
On an open hearth there gleamed and
flickered a little fire, whose smoke escaped
through a hole in the roof, and seated over
it was. a pale and abject man, with his
wrists tied behind him, whom the Captain
recognised immediately.
“Good God, Macpherson—what are you
doing here?”
He recognised a squatter from down the
Hunter—-a man noted for his tyrannous
brutality to his assigned servants, even in a
time and place when few masters were re-
nowned for their kindly treatment of the
unfortunates allotted to them under the
peculiar economy of “the System.”
The man looked up. and shook his head,
and Freebody saw with horror that his
mouth was raw and bloody.
“In Heaven’s name, wliat's this. McNab?
What devil's work have you been at? What’s
the matter with Mr. Macpherson? Great
God, man—look at his face!”
The outlaw' nodded, and laughed. “Weel,
Cap’n—’tis juist this w r ay. Tammas Mac-
phairson ivas aince ma mither’s landlor-rd,
i’ th’ Old Wor-rld. He was aince my maister,
here i’ th’ New Wor-rld. He turned in a
mither oot o’ her bit boldin’ at liame. he
floggit me cruel down at yon Saint Hilda's
on Hoonter’s River. ’Tis my tur-rn th’ noo.
He’ll no’ oppress th’ widdy an’ tli’ orphan
again i’ tli’ Old Wor-rld- —for lie’s here i’
the New r . Down below', Newcastle ways, an’
on th’ Sydney side, ’tis juist tli’ Old Wor-rld
transplanted overseas. But up here, where
W'c are th' noo. ’tis anither sor-rt o’ wor-rld
a’thegither. To-night lie's gaun tae dee.
An’ I’ve brought ye up here, where ye maun
bide a week or tw T a, to draw up a proper
wull an' testament, whereby lie makes
restitution to ma mither’s bairns, ma three
sisters. Ye’ll draw tli’ wull, all proper an’
correct, as I’ll instruct ye, an’ ’twill go over-
seas in a ship that’s sailin’ twa weeks frae

when th’ docymint’s sauf on its way tae the
writer’s in Auld Reekie that does Tammas-
liere’s business. ’Twill but refer to property
i’ Scotland, but that wull be enough. Ye’ll
do that after tea, or by God, oot comes your
tongue, too!”
Captain Freebody shuddered as he looked
at Macpherson’s bloody mouth.
“My God!” he said. “How could you
treat the man so!”
The red man laughed. “ ’Tis naught to how
he’s treated ithers. Mon. ’twill be a lesson
till ye! But ye’ve a good name, Cap'ri, an’
we’ll dae ye no liar-rm. On’y—ye’ll mind
to dae what we tell ye : for this is th’ New
Wor-rld, Cap’n—the New Wor-rld !”
Captain Freebody looked at the bloody
object before him, and then at Red Donald.
He shuddered ; but lie knew that in this
New World he would do as he was bidden.

The Inspiration.
[FOR THE BULLETN.]
IT was market-day in the little bush town
of Telford, and everyone was making
the usual holiday of it. No one was in
a hurry. Sulkies and spring-carts stood in
a long line in Guthrie-street, and were stick-
ing out behind every tree in the neighboring
paddocks.
The market-place was the Town Hall.
There the amiable auctioneer and his clerk,
posted with their wares behind a long rope
that stretched down the hall, were faced by
rows of farmers and their wives—quite a
number of them very young farmers wearing
whiskers. The young men at Telford wear
a wreath of whiskers round their faces. And
amongst the queer collection of things to be
sold, from bunches of flowers to crates of
fowls, there was a faded chintz cushion.
It looked a shabby and old-fashioned
cushion when the clerk held it up for in-
spection. and the first bid was ninepence.
The auctioneer, with stacks of fruit, veget-
ables, books and boots and an exceptionally
heavy supply of crates of fowls waiting for
him to knock down, was tempted to take Hie
first bid. But he had a really engaging indif-
ference to the passage of time, and for some
inexplicable reason he felt an impulse to talk
about the cushion.
“It may surprise you to hear.” he said,
addressing the bearded young farmers, “that
this is a cushion with a history. It was the
property at one time of a very old resident
who lived in this district in the days of the
bushrangers. One day she witnessed a fight
between the police and some bushrangers on
the road below her farm, And when the
fight was over she ran down with this cushion
and laid it under the head of a dying bush-
range?.”
There was a stir of interest among the
young farmers as the auctioneer paused. The
bidding rose to five shillings.
“Five shillings,” said the auctioneer. “Five
shillings! And that’s why I say this cushion
has a history. Some future time, when curios
of the old days are being collected for the
Telford Museum, it may be worth money!”
“Seven-and-six,” said a voice from the
group of young farmers.
“Seven-and-six,” said the auctioneer. “I
daresay he was only a young bushranger.
Perhaps it was his first day on the road. It
often happens like that. And perhaps he
was not really a bushranger from choice, but
had been driven to it by the rich landowners
and police. Everything he did was ‘on the
cross,’ they said. In the end he was forced
on to the road.”
“Ten shillings—fifteen shillings— on''
pound.”
“One pound. Any advance on one pound?
Twenty-five—thirty shillings. And for all
we know it might have been his last day on
the road. Perhaps he had promised a girl
to give, up bushranging for ever. Perhaps
that night he was to meet her at her father's
sliprails, and they were to start a new life
together.” "
“Thirty-five shillings,” said a reckless voice.
“Thirty-five shillings.” repeated the auc-
tioneer smoothly. "And when he lay dying
on the road, and felt the woman's hand
gently slip the cushion under his head, he
thought the girl he loved was beside him.
And he whispered with his dying breath,
‘Grace, it was my last ride!’”
“Two pounds-—any advance? Are you all
done? Mr. Smidson,” said the auctioneer.
The clerk collected the money, and handed
the cushion to a proud young farmer with
whiskers like a halo in the wrong place.
“What started yon spruiking about the
cushion?” the amazed clerk whispered to the
auctioneer.
“I don’t know,” he replied, with a gleam of
triumph in his eye. “Something came over
me. And I could have run her up to ten
pounds, if all them fowls hadn’t been
waiting.”

In Absence.
[FOR THE BULLETN.]
“I love you, I love you,” I beard the wild
night calling.
There were mad stars in the far sky and
the dew- was falling.
“I want you. I want you”—it was the sweet
wind wooing;
And my heart cried. “Oh, absent love, what
are you doing?”
“I love you, I love you,” I heal'd my own
voice sobbing.
There were wild tears in my tired eyes and
my throat was throbbing.
“I want you, I want you”—it was your own
mouth speaking;
And truant lips were mine—all mine—their
true home seeking.

At the Melbourne Gun Club's Grounds, Brighton, Vic., on the 7th
March, “Rowsley,” using REMINGTON UMC “ARROW” grade shotgun

the 30-yard mark. C. B. Meadway, using REMINGTON UMC “NITRO

birds.
Cartridges have long been made of so-called “waterproof” paper, but our
exclusive process is distinctly different. All REMINGTON UMC cases are
thoroughly “wetproofed”— top wad, crimp and body; and are the only loaded shells
on the market positively sealed against wet. Smokeless powder necessarily contains
a certain amount of moisture. REMINGTON UMC “wetproofing” seals in this
moisture, thus preventing the powder from drying out or deteriorating.
