“The Cursed Drink”—Again!
The New South Wales drunkard has a hare
time of it. His hide has been abraded, his
flesh contused, and his gentler susceptibili-
ties excoriated by the remorseless Commis-
sioners who recently gouged their way into
the secrets of his inner nature and dropped a
plummet into the dim and dismal depths of
his Plutonian soul. But the Commission
did not get very much by way of trophy.
Antres vast and deserts wide met, or rather
refused to meet it on every hand, and it had
to retire with some gorgeous cloudland sun-
set generalities which fit all over without
touching anywhere in particular. One thing,
however, seemed moderately conclusive,
viz., the young Australian can drink like his
forefathers. This is a severe blow, espe-
cially to the Sydney evening papers, for, ac-
cording to the old theory, all the drunken-
ness was confined to the imported article,
and all the salacity to the locally-raised pro-
duct. The “drunks” column was wont to read
— “Jeames MacSwankey, Scotch; Michael
Mulqixbeny, Irish ; William Grubbins,
English ; and the “ frightful and revolting
outrage ” column was specially devoted to
the alleged purely Aust»-an vice of force-
ful violation. Perhaps the increase in
drunkenness may be accounted for by the
fact that the “ revolting outrage ” is at pre-
sent in disfavour, and the allegations of hys-
terical girls suffering from impudicious
neurosis are received with derision by the
authorities who too often of late have been
hocussed into “ getting up ” bogus cases
which have melted into something less than
thin air before the crucial test of cold and
dispassionate investigation. So the youth-
ful Australian has been obliged to nurse the
faults of his fathers and make the most of
the time-honoured vices of the mead-swill-
ing followers of Odin and Thor.
* • *
It is just possible that the increase in
drunkenness in Australia in general, and in
New South Wales in particular, may be partly
due to climatic influence. The fervour of
southern summers, and the wretched quality
and character of all beverages not alco-
holic, are probably greater sinners than
the unthinking drinker who accelerates his
end by drinking fusel-oil. The increase in
drunkenness in Australia is also undoubtedly
due in part to the fiscal policy of some of
the colonies, and notably that of New South
Wales. In the latter colony taxation of an
excessive character is levied upon spirits and
colonial beer, and no attempt is made to
develope the local wine industry, although it
is universally admitted that wine-drinking
countries are singularly free from drunken-
ness, particularly from the grosser forms so
familiar to all who bear the honoured name
of Briton. In the sale of fiery stimulants
in a fiery clime, publicans, in their endeavour
to compete against one another and in an
attempt to dispense the same quantity of
liver-searing chemicals at the old price,
adulterate, to an incredible extent, vile stuff
already over-charged with poison even at
the best of times.
• * *
Curiously enough, no one seems to recog-
nise the fact that drinking habits, like horse-
racing or gambling, volunteering, or pitch-
and-toss, are simply a desperate effort on the
part of a great number to raise by artificial
stimulus the tone of life. Beyond an
occasional glimpse of the Governor, or the
still more occasional excitement of a hanging
—very seldom four at a time—what is there
worth living for in Sydney to the average
citizen thereof ? True, the Sydney people
have Parses and the pedestal that has been
yearning for years for the Queen’s “ statchu,”
and a “glorious system of Freetrade,” but
somehow there appears to be a craving for
something beyond and transcending these
ponderous blessings—in disguise, certainly.
Man has divorced himself from Nature. We
are all of us leading more or less arti-
ficial lives, and as a natural conse-
quence we thirst for artificial stimulants.
Fools express surprise that sensationalism
should draw better at the average theatre
than the legitimate drama. Why should it
not ? Modem civilisation is a melodrama.
We are satiated with the leaden-hued misery
of life, its dull, dreary round of dust and
drudgery, its somnolent freetrade news-
papers with their Sahara-desert columns of
fiscal drivel and society small-talk; the
doings of Pump Court pall with their insipid
vapidness, and we long for a murder to re-
awaken our interest in existence. Our
nerves require bracing with the blood-curd-
ling details of a stupendous outrage# sugar-
coated according to taste with the minutest
details. We should like to snatch a fearful
pleasure from a holocaust if we coul 1 get it.
We smack our lips with unction over a
terrible shipwreck, and we revel in an ac
count of a fricasseed opera-house. Lacking
all these stimulants, we go to the theatre and
maunder over something idiotic written in
gore with the point of a carving knife
on the skin of a human heart. Some
of us do not go to the theatre. Some
of us go to the pub, round the tabooed corner
and—get drunk. Each according to the
variety and extent of his sufferings and the
strength and vigour of his physique. Some
cannot get drunk because the physical
penalty is too great. Should these latter
ever succeed in getting drunk, the rest of the
longers after excitement get a snaok of un-
usually luscious slaughter, or an outrage of
some description or other, which makes
them reasonably happy for awhile. Civilised
men and women are, after all, too often ghouls
herded together in gigantic charnel-houses
which they euphemistically term cities, and
their principal pabulum is garbage.
* * *
Thera is in this age of progressive ration-
alism a tendency to refer everything to
natural causes, but we are still far, far away
from that time when people will look upon
all questions of a social character from an
absolutely cold and scientific standpoint with
their eyeballs stripped of the epidermis of
sentiment, and their attitude unbiassed by
sympathy with accuser or accused. The
habit of challenging all mental phenomena
for a material cause is not the habit of the
thought of to-day, but it may be the habit
of the thought of to-morrow. And the
medical man is the forerunner and apostle of
the doctrine of necessity. During the re-
cent sittings of the Sydney Drink Commis-
sion the empiricism of sentiment and the
philosophy of the scientist came slightly into
collision. Gaol and Hospital rubbed shoul-
ders, and the medico and the magistrate
were each in turn put forward as the Orlando
to take a fall out of this Charles among
wrestlers —Drink. There was evinced .a de-
cided tendency to urge the Government to
increase the restrictive character of the law
regulating the traffic in fermented liquors ;
as if people could be made virtuous by Act
of Parliament, and as if it were desirable
that they should, provided this particular
brand of Parliamentary righteousness by the
grace of molly-coddle was as efficacious in
the production of abhorrence to forbidden
naughtiness as it certainly would be in the
production of weaklings and nincompoops—
for man has a fatal facility in adjusting him-
self to his environment. There was also
a strongly-marked tendency to recog-
nise drinking habits as a question for
the doctor rather than for the policeman—
as a disease rather than a crime. Dr.
Mackellar, as we should have expected
him to do, supported the idea of an institu-
tion, established by the State, for the treat-
ment of habitual drunkards on somewhat
the same lines as lunatic asylums, and that
apart from the benefit to the individual, he
considered it would be cheaper for the State
to establish such retreats on a voluntary as
well as on a compulsory principle. He
objected, however, to calling them reforma-
tories or asylums, and regarded them purely
in the light of hospitals as dealing with
diseases and not crimes. Though in connec-
tion with this matter of insanity and drunken
ness we should like, in passing, to call the
Doctor’s attention to the fact that indulgence
in alcohol is as often a symptom as a cause of
some form of neurosis. Bishop Barry also
spoke in favour of the asylum, and instanced
the English “ Dalrymple’s Act ” which
enables people to be incarcerated in an
asylum by their own consent, which, when
once given, cannot be withdrawn. Bishop
Barry also stated that he could see no
reason why the habitual drunkard should be
treated differently from persons suffering
from temporary insanity—their condition
being analogous, Mr. Hunt, who has had
practical experience as an hotel proprietor,
was of opinion that if the magistrates had
power to commit drunkards to an inebriate
asylum, one in eight, or one in ten, might
be saved, as none are reclaimed under the
present system of sending them to gaol.
Another witness thought that if he himself
were an habitual drunkard he would most
decidedly prefer being sent to a hospital or
an asylum than to a police lock-up, though
this speaker became absurdly illogical, and
admirably exemplified the effect on the mind
of living for a considerable term of years in
a colony governed by outworn convict laws,
when he declared that he did not consider
the punishment in gaol in New South Wales
sufficiently severe—the reasonable reductio
absurdum being that he would, in his model
hospital for inebriates, cause the treatment
to consist of drastic applications of the cat
every morning before breakfast and upon
every other convenient occasion afterwards.
The idea of sending a man to a hospital to
be cured of a mental disorder by being
treated as if he were detained in prison for
a criminal offence is truly original—at least
outside the Supreme Court. The main
point, illustrated by the foregoing, is, how-
ever, this—when men begin to recognise
that dipsomania, like kleptomania (when
the latter is practised by the wealthy or the
well-connected) is a species of lunacy, the
day cannot surely be so far distant when
colonial Supreme Court Judges will cease to
order floggings for unnatural offences —evi-
dence, by its very name in the charge-sheet,
of another form of mental instability.
* * *
But to return to the Drink Commission’s
repoit. Why should the Government take up
so philanthropic a position in relation to the
drunkard? Why all this Parliamentary
benevolence ? “Oh ! ” replies the fanatic
one-idealism of the teetotaller, “ because
his habits are hurtful to his health, to bis
life, to the physical well-being of his progeny,
to the happiness of his wife and family.”
Bah ! If Government intends playing the
part of universal benefactor and family phy-
sician, why does it not interfere and prevent
a man sitting in front of a grindstone all day
sharpening cutlery, while his lungs are being
choked-up with impalpable dust ?—which,
by the way, causes him to drink “ con-
sumedly.” Why does not the Government
tear the painter from his white-lead and its
resultant paralysis, or the cotton-spinner
from out of the atmosphere in which he
breathes only fluff ? Why permit the medical
man to daily brave the possibilities of hemal
poisoning ? or the stonemason to fill up the
capillary passages of his breathing apparatus
with molecules of granite ? Or, coming
nearer home, why should Government allow
the po’idcian-directed loan-office to endanger
the health or the reason of the hard-toilxng
vanman or carter whose life is almost ground
out of him in frantic endeavours to pay prin-
cipal and interest at the rate of 130 per
cent, per annum upon a small sum advanced
on hxs horse and cart —his sole means of
livelihood ? Why should trades be called
noxious and men allowed to work at them if
the State is so tender of its fiscal charges ?
Pshaw ! This is the age of pretended pro-
gress in which Science allies itself with
Capital and Bank, on the specious plea
based on superficial necessarianxsm that it is
useless to attempt to argue against the doc-
trine of the survival of the fittest, and they
plausibly assume that the fittest lie on the
loftiest lamination. If this is the acknow-
ledged basis of Society, as it is at pre-
sent constituted, why stop here ? Carry
out to its heartless end, O, Society ! your
theory of the survival of the fittest. Spread
state-endowed tables, let them groan laden
with decanters containing the choicest and
richest wines, poured out in all their purple
glory into golden flagons by beauteous and
bewitching Hebes, clad in the most sumptu-
ous of raiment, and inciting with luscious
and blood-tingling glances the weak, and the
vicious, and the crazy, to the work of intoxi-
cation and paralysis, lunacy and death.
Survival of the fittest! Let your brother—
as you boast he is in your moments of
Christianity and delirium—perish as Nature
or God intended ha should perish, and let
those strong enough to withstand temptation
suck up the fat and the fruit of the earth !
• • •
Bub unfortunately for theorists, the fittest
are not always the careful, canny, prosper-
ous, sober, mediocre bourgeoisie. The
fittest intellectually are sad disturbers of
logarithms. If they drink not, they oft do
worse. Coleridge and De Quince y sought
intellectual excitement in a narcotic drug.
They flew to opium. Burns, Tom Campbell,
Edgar Allan Poe, Australia’s Kendall,
that inspired mystery Clarence Mangan,
and many other brilliant spirits sought the
same kind of excitement in an alcoholic
stimulant. Even the bullock-driver in the
remote bush will work and slave six months
out of twelve for the sake of saving money
enough to enable him to forget the monotony
of his environment in a -spree. Perhaps
Burns strove to forget his poverty, or Poe
his failures in the delirium of drink. But it
may be that this so-called weakness is only
part and parcel of the peculiar temperaments
of these men. After urging the over-ten-
sioned brain to extraordinary accomplish-
ment a reaction necessarily follows. To sus-
taia that reaction and to continue the
intellectual dissipation beyond its period of
normal duration an alcoholic or other stimu-
lant becomes a necessity. It is useless to
bewail the fact that the stimulant slays. The
possession of extraordinary ability itself may,
from this standpoint, be regarded as a mis-
fortune ; the sword wears out the sheath,
but the sheath must not complain. Of
course, dram-drinking accelerates the work
of ruin, which may, after all, be unavoidable.
As Gay aptly puts it, “ The fly that sips
treacle is lost in the sweets,” and so with the
toper. But, what then ?. It is just possible
that the names—some of them unquestion-
ably great ones—which we have above
quoted would never have beamed so brightly
from fame’s high firmament had their
wearers been the sons of Rechab. It is
just possible that they could never have sus-
tained the wear and tear of mental debau-
chery and consequent physical waste with-
out such stimulant. Perhaps, too, the very
craving was a part of their nature—they
were simply living up to the plenitude of
their life-powers.
* * *
There is no little inspiration in the wine-
cup. Half Poe’s literary work is saturated
with wine-fumes and wine-lees. Tempera
ments differ, and it is only repeating a com-
mon adage to remark that “ one man’s meat
is another man’s poison.” “Yes,” object
the man who fljunts in his self-righteou
moral insolence a blue ribbon in his abste
mious button-hole, “ but you must adm:
there is a vast difference between the cas
of the shanty sot, thirsting only for du
oblivion, and that of the exquisitely-attunec
highly-strung, intellectual debauchee. Th
one seeks only a means of satisfying
bestial propensity, a depraved taste, th
other an elixir of potency to recuperate ex
bausted faculties and sustain abnormal men
tal excitement.” The difference, however
is one of degree only. Who shall say wha
ecstatic pleasures peculiar to his kind ar
unlocked even to the humblest votary o
Bacchus ? A man’s predilection for drinl
is often inseparable from his peculiar organi
sation, as a like predilection to other ex
cesses is the intrinsic concomitant of othe
organ sations. Why abuse the snake for
the possession of poison-fangs or the leoparc
for being spotted ? The innocuous snake
strikes with equal energy, and its lack of
deadly attribute is no fault or benevolence 01
its own. To regret that a man is other than
Nature made him is illogical and unavailing.
A man is the sum of his ancestors actec
upon by a force outside his own volition—a
creature whose slightest act is directed and
inflected by transmitted impulse modulated
and modified by accordance or variance with
the extrinsic conditionings that go to make
up his environment. A mental habit or a
moral weakness is as much inherited as a
high shoulder or a halt in the gait.
* * *
Commenting in a leader on the report of
the Drink Commission, the Sydney D.T.
managed to evolve from the inner conscious-
ness of its folding-machine this atom of im-
perishable wisdom :
“ What makes the one sober and the other a
drunkard ? And when we ask this we often find
that the answer is that the men are constituted
differently in all respects. One has a power of
restraint, a firmness of moral fibre, a self-control
and self-direction which give him the mastery
of his own life, while the other is vacillating
in purpose, unsteady, helpless, and subservient
to his lower instead of his better impulses."
This is simple lunacy. According to the
above quotation, “ men are constituted
differently in all respects,” and yet the D.T.
gives only a list of certain supposititious moral
qualitks. Why not continue, “ One has a
coarse, animalistic nature which no drug can
conquer, no beer lap in oblivion, while the
other is so delicately strung that a single
pipe of tobacco, a single glass of grog, in-
duces what Charles .Lamb terms ‘ those
uneasy sensations in head and stomach which
are so much worse to bear than any definite
pains and aches.’ One has the constitutional
vigour of the hippogriff, nerves of steel, and
thews of iron ; his muscles are rock and his
stomach is leather, and he soaks it from
morn till night in fiery libations to Bacchus,
yet suffers not; the ocher is a man of nerves,
a bundle of sensibilities, a human iEolian
harp with a tempest of passion forever
sweeping the strings, and drink means to
him suicide.” Yet this man is the criminal.
The habitual soaker seldom commits any
excess, but if drinking is a crime per se, the
most flagrant offender—if we measure the
crime by the quantity of liquor imbibed—is
least harmful to society. A man commits a
crime while under the influence of drink,
not because he is “unsteady, helpless, and
subservient to his lower instead of his better
impulses,” but simply because the kind
Providence that watches over the editor of
the D.T. did not give him as much fat and
muscle as nerves,
♦ * ♦
Men will drink to the crack of doom, and
if they resist this weakness they imme-
diately cultivate another. They turn out
one devil and let furnished apartments to
seven, each one of whom is a dozen times
worse than the oiiginal imp. The revolt
against the humdrum dreariness of life, if it
takes not the form of a seeking after excite-
ment in alcoholic drink, drifts into the dubi-
ous by-ways and back-alleys of debauchery,
and finds its vent in morphia, opium, chloral,
and other nerve-shattering, diabolical abom-
inations, far more terribly ruinous in their
effects upon the constitution, a thousandfold
more harmful to posterity, more destructive
of will, increasedly progenitive of unenergetic
fatalism. The man who lives near to
Nature’s heart wants little in the way of drug
or dram beyond the soothing narcotic of
tobacco. But for those who live in cities, who
linger and cling to existence through years
of unvarying monotonous drudgery, whose
daily life is an apathetic struggle to keep the
lower lip above water, whose little span of
action is dictated by the stern voice of a re-
lentless stomach craving its diurnal dole;
for those who sweat and struggle, and strive
and starve, who work because they must;
for those who have to read the weaty, dreary
leaders in the Sydney D.T. or the S.M.H.,
drink is a necessity. It is drink or go mad !
Hence they drink. There is an excuse for
the tired pressman paid to write what he
knows to be lies. The average journalist
who belongs to the Good Templars must
have a conscience of adamant. The lawyer,
too, is excusable on similar grounds. When
he has, for the sake of living merely, to soil
his soul with the darkling stains that can


,„ h8 washed out in brandy, who could
him to be other than a tippler!
The point, after all, comes back to this
wS wo have no belief in the supernal
f® J the New South Wales or any other
Government to legislate drink „„t of the
Go \ we do think that Government
a LhV do much to legislate had drink out of
,T g fand Men will drink, and if they do
k drink they will cultivate some more
n . .„ a habit Let the State accept the
situation ; Men will drink or do something
in the frenzied endeavour to obtain an
cmiivalent to alcohol as a mental excitant :
hince the Government can best seive the
“ .‘ e of morality by obviating as far as possi-
the need for police, magistrates, gaols,
B «vlams, hospitals,doctors,nurses and graves
for inebriates. The greater number of men
that die from the effects of drink, die not
m much from the effects of drink as from the
effects of had drink. Let the liquor-Inspector
become a power in the land, and let the
State encourage wine-drinking by encourag-
ing the wine industry, and the necessity for
aavlums will grow proportionately less. Let
the State as far as possible safeguard the
nerves and the stomach of the consumer by
seeing that a genuine article for consumption
Is provided, and it will justly merit the
heart-felt blessings of all who are not woe-
wrung, washy fellows, and who, as Charles
Tomb Anacreontically puts it, ‘ ‘ must, at
some time, have felt the after operation of
a too generous cup.”
Freetrade “Arguments.”
THE Freetrade partisans in New Fouth Wales
have demonstrated that there is at least one
native industry which cau flourish without the
jid of Protection— namely, the fabrication of
statements out of nothing in the shape of solid
truth, and the erection of imposing fabrics of
argument without any material save that supplied
by their own fertile imaginat ions. The audacious
courage and untiring energy displayed by the
political leaders who affect Cobdenism, in the
falsification of history, in the invention of fictional
conditions, and in drawing on the unknown future
for support for their cause, are mainly due to the
absence of a well-informed and honest Press. If
even a New Fouth Wales Freetrader knew that
any departure on his part from the facts of his-
tory, and any erroneous allegations as to the
actual and prospective outcome of lines of policy,
would be exposed in the editorial columns of the
papers which print his enunciations, no doubt he
would be less sparing of truth and probability.
But experience teaches him that, in the dailies of
Sydney at all events, he will be aided and abetted
in the promulgation of any doctrines whic£ favour
the commercial theory ; and hence be habitually
plunges without compunction into unfounded
assertion, brazen perversion, and the wildest of
wild conjecture. The alacrity with which the
Freetrade newspapers adopt the errors of state-
ment aid absurd deductions of the Freetrade
politicians is oftenest simply matter for amuse-
ment—too ludicrous to engage the serious attention
of journalists not concerned in propping up the crum-
bling edifice of Cobdenism-and here again is found
a reason for the phenomena of systematised pre-
varication presented so frequently and with ever-
increasing effrontery by the exponents of Calico-
jEMMY-ism. Under a laisnez faire method of
treatment the manufacture of ingenious means of
deceiving the people certainly makes good pro-
gress, however ordinary industrial enterprise
languishes.
* * *
Mr. B. R. Wise, Attorney-General and Presi-
dent of the N.S.W. Freetrade Association, is
facile princeps in the art of promulgating specious
yarns whose basis of truth is represented by zero.
His letter to the Association the other day is a
fair sample of his skill in this direction, though
it shows a progressive tendency to politically
economise the truth that should eventuate in a
speedy collapse of this system of fiscal warfare.
Mr. Wise begins by making the wholly unwar
ranted assertion that in the last N.S.W. Assembly
there were between 70 and 80 Protectionists,
while in the present House there are barely 40.
The facts are, as we have already pointed out,
that in the last Parliament there were not a score
of pronounced Protectionists, including even
Abigail and Clarke and Roberts and Garrett
and Sutherland, the recreant Protectionists
who are now members of the soi-dtsant
Freetrade Ministry; as against, in the current
Parliament, no fewer than 43 members pledged
right out to support a policy inimical to that
of Parkes and Wise and the Calico Jimmies.
Having perpetrated this direct untruth touching
a matter of yesterday and to-day in his own colony,
Wise proceeds in his letter to deal in unfounded
assertion and suggestiofalsiinvesvectot eventsand
eventualities more remote both as to time and place.
This is the way in which he raves
The progress of Freetrade abroad ought also to afford us
great encouragement. The liberal and enlightened countries
of Europe hold more firmly than before to the policy of
fiscal freedom. Switzerland, Holland, Sweden Nor-
way, and that mother of freedom among nations, the United
kingdom, show no sign of wavering in their fidelity to the
principles of justice and equality. While even in the war-
Wdden countries, around which protective tariffs have been
raised for military purposes, signs are not wanting that the
sufferings these create will soon become mtolerable. War
‘and tariffs,’ as Mr. Bright has lately said, ‘ are the two great
enemies of mankind.’ Their intimate association is plainly
'visible in recent European history. Until 1874 there was a
large and steady progress towards Freetrade upon the part of
every continental nation. The example o mg an a
proved contagious, and tariffs weie being reduced even m
the moat despotic States, The fever of militarism which fol-
lowed the Franco-Prussian war, and the necessity imposed
on the Europtan countries of maintaining gigantic arma-
ments has earned again rts rt to he made to the Custom
House; but it is an undeniabU fact, visible to anyone who
chooses to investigate, that the growth of 1 1 election in
Europe, of which we often hear in New South Wales, has
aeen the direct result of a despotic and a military hostility,
and is a distinct reversal of the policy previously followed in
Europe from the years 1850 to 1875. It is almost certain that
in the crash of the first great war these childish barriers
against human intercourse will tumble to the ground.”
* * *
What gorgeously circumstantial bunkum 1 The
idea that Holland and Sweden have ever shown
any signs of abandoning a Protectionist policy
must surely have originated in ignorance. And
the scarcely less preposterous statement that
Britain shows no sign of wavering in its fidelity to
Freetrade is also evidence of crass ignorance—or
wilful blindness. As a matter of fact, beyond all
controversy, the British people are wavering.
Twenty years ago the man who argued in favour
of Protection in England was looked upon with
mingled pity and contempt. He was regarded as
in the same case as searchers for the philosopher's
stone, believers in Cock-lane ghosts, and such-like
monomanias. To-day the Fair Trade League is
a power in the land, and the Cohdenists are driven
to their wits’ ends to invent arguments subversive
of the growing creed of Protection. But the
greatest of all the nonsense this gtnius has
given us is his prophecy to the effect that in the
crash of the first great war the barriers of Protec-
tion will tumble to the ground. Germany will
conquer Prance or vice versa, but that the victor
will be able to hold the conquered country is in-
credible. If it does not, obviously the de-
sire and determination of each to protect
its industries against the competition of the
other would be more marked than at pre-
sent. If the conquering power were cap-
able of holding the vanquished nation in sub-
jection it is equally plain that the extension of
territory would simply mean an enlargement of
the customs cordon, and that the increased Ger-
many or increased France would indulge with
renewed energy In the business of combating the
industrial energies of other nations. For it is
just as bad for a community to be crushed out by
looms as by bayonets, by cheap labour as by hordes
of invaders; and if the statesmen of the conquering
Germany or France fail to perceive this, they will
belie the whole tenor of their national genius.
* * •
Having indulged himself in a walk ever the
position in Europe, Wise crosses the Atlantic and
there he perceives that Protection and war go
hand in hand. The prospective war in Europe is
to abolish protection, but protection in America
is the immediate outcome of war—so this
authority has the effrontery to proclaim Tie
makes the curious statement that the Protective
tariff of the United States owes its existence to
the “exigencies of the Civil war” in that
country; and the S.M. Herald backs up this
falsification of history in a leading article which
is brimful of misstatement and erroneous infer-
ence. Mr. Wise and the Herald writer should
learn that the existing tariff in Amefica is one of
the chief triumphs of the civil war. The very
first Customs Act passed by the American Con-
gress, sitting at Philadelphia in 1780, set forth in
its preamble that the dues were imposed “ for the
encouragement and protection of manufactures.
In 1816 a still more protective tariff was
adopted. In 1824 the Protectionists went a step
further, and the duties on imports were increased
until the nigger-owners of the Southern States,
who were interested simply in growing cotton
with slave labour and supplying themselves with
European manufactures on cheap principles, re-
belled and refused to respect the Federal
Custom-house. But the Federal Custom-
house was maintained then and thereafter ; and
despite the opposition of the Southern and some
of the Western States, the policy of Protection
flourished and gradually came to assume a position
of absolute supremacy. The argument that the-
existing duties were imposed for the purpose of
raising revenue to meet the war engagements is a
fresh departure in Freetrade tactics. Heretofore all
authorities of the Cobdenist school have contended
that a duty on imports was useless in a revenue
point of view without a countervailing duty on
home production. To put 14s. a gallon on im-
ported spirits, for instance, would not be to aug-
ment the revenue unless a corresponding duty
were imposed on domestic distillation. But Wise
and his friend of the Herald ignore all this, and
argue that a tariff wholly in favour of the home
manufacturer was intentionally enforced with the
object of raising money by taxing competition I
Surely these gentry had better learn the alphabet
of political economy and finance before going in
for inventing history and deducing arguments
therefrom,
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Ailesbury’s Sentence.
The Stewards of that most autocratic and aristo-
cratic club on earth —the English Jockey Club
have celebrated Jubilee year by warning a real
live Marquis off the turf. As in Australia, so
doubtless in England, this unique incident is pro-
the integrity of a noble body which makes no dis
tincUon between the transgressions of peer and
commoner! &c. It enables the Argus, for in-
stance to cast its hundred eyes heavenward, and
mention that “ the decision is the more valuable
because it has been given by men of the ®
own order.” Now. we fancy that when the true
story o of this scandal (told by a reliable paper like
the Referee) comes to hand, it will be found that
the Tcckey Club’s decision was grossly unjust
Sdged by their ordinary standard of turf
morality. In the first place, they called upon the
Marquis of Ailesbury to explain the suspicious
mnnins of a horse that won its race, after making
a dead heat with something else. Later on it
occurred to them that even a tribunal (0 f docks
and nrinces cannot convict anyone of roping
an antoal which comes in first. So the virtuous
s'ewards ream ed baoK for an excuse, aid
ihe in selves that * there had been unfair mnn.ng
with the Marquis's horses on previous cccasiuns.
Briefly, they now decided to punish the offender
for crimes they had formerly winked at. By this
self-damning statement the Jockey Club made
it clear enough that they have dropped
upon their noble brother for certain private
reasons. The Marquis of Ailesbuby is not
as other marquises are. His indiscreet marriage
with Dolly Tester, a music-hall maiden, might
be overlooked, seeing that other hereditary legis-
lators have chosen other Dollies and Totties,
and, by so doing, have rather invigorated their sap-
less family trees. But AilesBURY s extravagant
vulgarity of dress and manner —his penchant for
cutting coarse jokes and swearing filthy oaths in
the congenial society of “dreadful” people—has
given great offence to our old nobihty. His con-
stant behaviour on a race course was calculated
to bring contempt upon the system which allows
such a man to assist in making Old England’s
laws. Therefore the Jockey Club "warned off"
the Marquis of Ailksbury because he is of their
own order, and not in spite of that fact, as they
would wish the admiring crowd to believe. As a
horse-owner, this particular young fellow is, pro-
bably, quite as honest as most other noblemen. It
is not asserted that he has taken lessons in
“stacking” and dealing cards from the bottom
of the pack, like certain members of the august
body who pronounced his doom. Not at all. If
the Marquis of ailksbury had been a courtly
trickster, cultivating the caste of Yebe de Vbre,
he might have lived in the odour of royal patron-
age and Jockey Cub and died with all the tottering
old roues of that august body weeping round his
bed. We may expect to find it leak out that his
disgrace was a “ cooked” affair, secretly ordered
by the Prince of Wales.
“ Cheering News from the N.S.W,
Treasury."
We always like to see a man labour diligently to
prove himself a velvet-pile, double-sewn, bevel-
edged ass. He always takes such pains over the
job, when all the while anyone who is watching
him can tell right away what the result of his
arduous labours will he. It was on account of
such considerations that we felt a perceptible acoes*
sion of joy when perusing the Sydney D.T. article
under the above caption. For with revenue
figures gloomier than a Freetrade Association’s
balance-sheet before him, the gifted scribe laid
himself out to prove that prosperity surrounded
New South Wales as with a garment. The main
cause of his counteifeit joy was that the New
South Wales revenue for the September quarter
of this year was £201,000 greater than for the
same quarter of 1886. And as he was dealing with
one quarter only, it was in a sense appropriate that
he should confine himself to one quarter of the truth,
t he other three-quarters are discerned in the fact
that pastoral occupation revenue accounts for
£IBI,OOO of this increase (mainly owing to the
pajment of arrears from 1885-6) and auction sales
of public lands for £32,000 more. These two
together amount to £216,000, so that, removing
these items from the calculation, the whole of the
remaining items show a net decrease of £32,000 as
computed with the same period of last year ITo
arrive at any reasonable estimate of the colony’s
progress, these items of pastoral rents and auction
sales must be deducted, for the greater part of the
pastoral revenue Coes not belong to this
year at all, and the land auctioned sim-
ply represents so much of the national
capital parted with and gone for ever.
And, moreover, it must be remembered that the
ad valorem and Jennings specific duties have
done their last service to the State. Henceforth
the “ Cocky” Burns tariff will rule the Customs
and the revenue will suffer accordingly. Farther
it will be observed that the total revenue for the
year ending the 30th of September was only
£8,100,000, so that if the gifted financier who now
bosses the Treasury wants to see his estimate
of £9,100,000 realised he will have to rake in
£1,000,000 more than the average quarter’s in-
come outing the next three months ! And this is
only one-half of the story ; the other half is that
the expenditure is going up past the record of all
previous years. The Government has had to sup-
port an army of unemployed labourers and
a host of unemployed aristocratic loafers,
whose good fortune it is to have a relative in the
'Ouse. What the expenditure is, or at what rate,
even the Treasurer himself can’t tell, for his
colleagues spend thousands without consulting
him, the Cabinet, or the country, and under pre-
sent circs. It is reasonably certain that in place of
a surplus of £900,000, there will, at the end of the
year, in spite of the received arrears of pastoral
rent, be very nearly £1,000,000 more to be added
on to the existing deficit of £2,500,000. With a
deficit of £3,500,000 at the end of the present
year, Freetrade will die suddenly without waiting
or a dose of “ Rough on Rats ”to be administered
by deceived and deluded electors.
A Promising Young Man.
The Sydney D.T. sits on its old familiar rail in
discussing the system by which Attorney-General
Wise receives a large salary from the New South
Wales Treasury, and at the same time at-
tempts to draw separate fees for perform-
ing the separate items of his duty. The
duties of that promising young man are some-
what multifarious, and apparently—from the way
he performs them—there is a good deal of money
attached. In the first place he has to de-
cide whether any particular suit brought
against the Crown is to be defended, and
having done so he virtually appoints himself
to conduct it—that is to say his subordinate
officer appoints him—and draws a fee for doing
so, in addition to his salary, which apparently is
paid him for his labours in advising the Govern-
ment to give him the said job with the
fee appended thereto. When this branch
of business is dull he amuses himself
by glancing through the evidence in rail-
way accident inquiries at which he was not
present, and then he writes a minute in a rapid,
flowing hand to the effect that the testimony is
all rubbish, and the jury are asses, and the
Government —which pays him his screw and
allows him special fees on top of it—is not in any
way to blame for anything that has happened, brrt
that the responsibility rests on somebody who is
dead, and who consequently can't defend himself.
A little thing like that amuses Mr, Wise, but even
the DT. is forced to admit that the arrange-
ment is hardly satisfactory in the fullest
sense of the term. According to the Con-
stitution Act, any member of Parliament
who accepts money for services rendered to the
Crown, except on the special vote of the Assem-
bly thereby forfeits his seat, and even now the
Elections and Qualifications Committee are debat-
ing whether the premising young man fresh from
Europe should not be cast out. According to all
law and equity Mr. Wise cannot retain his salary
and his pickings as well, but he entered a heroic
de'ence of the practice by which his salaried post
lion comes in so handily as an aid to outside em-
ployment. ana on the strength of this ihe D.l.
al'udes to him as a “ chivalrous individual who
sacrificed hia professional career for the sake of
his country, and urges that, because he is a pro-
mising young man, the law should be strained to
enable him to retain his seat. For our own part
we think one promising young man could be very
well spared from the New South Wales Legis-
lature. It is already full of them, while
performing young men are very scarce, and since
the promising Wise has taken to obtaining public
money on side issues by way of fulfilling the
public expectations regarding him, it is time tor
him to go out on hia ear, the D T. notwithstand-
ing. Either he must be content with ids ample
salary of £ISOO per annum, added to the results
of his not inconsiderable private practice, or ho
must go back into the ruca of the legal profession
and skirmish for a livelihood by defending the
gentleman who has shed the blood of his
missus. According to old-established custom
he is permitted to draw his salary and pay another
man out of the public treasury to do a great por-
tion of his work, but when he endeavours to draw
his salary and then pay himself to do hia work in
addition, it is too much to be endured. This the
D.T, carefully points out, but It still urges that
Mr. Wise, as a promising young man, should be
forgiven. Bless all such promising young men.

Referring to the recent libel action brought by
Mr. Julian Thomas (“The Vagabond”), the
Wesleyan Spectator says:—“While we owe
muqh to the excellent barristers who were en-
gaged on our side, we owe more to Him who
answereth prayer, and who, we are persuaded,
undertook our cause.” Probably no other sen-
tence in the whole range of literature contains
such an admixture of blasphemy and cant. The
reverend dunderhead who penned it failed to
grasp the obvious corollary to his proposition—if
the verdict of one farthing was directly due to
the interposition of Divine Providence, surely the
Almighty would have gone one better, and made
the jury declare absolutely in favour of the de-
fendants. Anyhow, it seems to us that the pious
proprietors had little faith in Him to whom they
refer with such insolent familiarity, or they
would scarcely have gone to the enormous ex-
pense of retaining Dr. Madden and Mr. Hodges.
From Sydney Daily Telegraph :
“ News has been received of the death of Rev. Dr. Justus
Brainbrd Vinton, of the Karen mission, Rangoon,
Burma, where he had laboured since 1861. His death was
doubtless hastened by his services in the recent war in
Burma, when he raised and equipped a force of Christians,
and materially assisted the British forces in their wont of
pacification."

It seems now to be pretty plain that Judge
Matthew Henry Stephen, of New South Wales,
was born considerably after his time, and that,
though fate has kindly allotted to him the heredi-
tarily congenial climate of Botany Bay, the era in
which he should properly have exercised judicial
functions was that which gave to the world all the
charming stories we hear of Norfolk Island trials.
The other day Judge Stf.piibn aforesaid sentenced
a man to two floggings of 25 lashes each —the
second lashing to be given II days after the first.
Should the first flogging have been “properly”
laid on, the chances are that this lacerated wretch
will be taken straight frc m the prison-hospital to
the triangle. It has been said that Judges order
solitary confinement because they don’t know
what it means, and perhaps it has never struck
Mr. Justice Stephen that after a man’s back has
been skinned with the lash it takes more than
a fortnight to get] it healed egain. But if.
being aware of 1 his simple physiological fact,
Judge Stephen deliberately ordered the second
flogging to take place before the mangled body
was healed, we can only conclude—well, a lot of
things. The judicial Stephens have all been odd
in their way. Ihe peculiarity of Sir Alfred
Stephen was, as the world knows, his excessive
amiability and his absurd soft-heartedness in the
matter of carrying out sentences of death. Then
there was Justice James Wilherforce Stephen,
of Victoria, who was just the opposite of old
Alfred Stephen. He looked like a well-bred
old maid, and he was called Wilberforce, after
a man who loved his fellow-man, and showed him
self all through a big-hearted philanthropist, aid
J. W. S.’s father got a knighthood for his efforts
in the anti-slavery cause. J, W. affected to imi-
tate a man with a bigger brain, Justice Fellows.
On one occasion a well-known Sandhurstman n amed
Trevarrow (by the way they somehow or other
never seem to flog well known men in N.S.W.)
was convicted before Fellows of offences against
children, and his Honor sentenced him to the full
penalty allowed by the Act—ten years' imprison-
ment and three floggings of 50 lashes each. Shortly
afterwards a semi-idiot was convicted before
Stephen of a mitigated offence of the same kind.
The governor of the gaol told the judge that the
prisoner was half-idiotic, and Stephen replied
that he believed every man who committed such
offences was suffering more or less from mem al
disease, but J. W. was thinking of Fellows and
Trevarrow, and lo and behold! he sentenced
this wretched idiot to ten years’ hard labour and
three floggings of 50 lasnes each I Has Mr.
Matthew Henry Stephen ever seen a man
flogged in gaol ? If he has not, Be might ask his
relative, Frank Stephen, the Melbourne at-
torney, what it’s like. One day Frank
and his son-in-law, Dr. Madden, the barrister,
went to Melbourne gaol to sec the first man
flogged under Wrjxon’s Act for ihe punishment
of offences against women and children. Well,
after the first half-dozen strikes had been ad-
ministered on Green alias O Toole, a man was
carried out of the yard. It wasn’t Green, other-
wise O'Toole, but one Frank Stephen, an
attorney. It was only by the administration of a
s:iff dose of brandy that Frank was brought
round, and from that day to -this you muen’t tulK
about flogging in his presence. And yet Frank
is not a chicken-hearted man. Ex-J ustice Moles-
worth, of Victoria, didn’t often order floggings,
but on one occasion he directed an old man, con-
victed of a certain offence, to receive chastise-
ment in a way which would have been more ap-
propriate had he been half a century younger.
That sentence stands unique in the prison records
of Victoria,

The S, M. Herald says of a certain Sydney

while he loafed to slow music round the steps of

man who, in “this so-called 19th century,” ren-

The election of Mr. M. H. Davies as Speaker of
the Victorian Assembly was carried through in a
way calculated to display the dignity of Austra-
lian political life. Before his candidature was
publicly announced, honourable members stated
that Mr. Peter Lalob retired under “ pressure,”
and that Mr. Davies had, in a Pickwickian sense,
bought the billet. Io was tacitly admitted by the
Ministry that their nominee’s claims to the
Speakership were based on the almighty dollar,
pure and simple. His parliamentary career had
been colourless and brief. His only services to
the community consisted in the fact that he had
bought up large tracts of land at a low figure and
waited for other men's enterprise to make the
land valuable. That Mr. Davies is president of
the Y.M O.A. was hardly advanced as a satisfac-
tory reason for selecting him to over a
Legislative Assembly, for there are limits to
ministerial assurance. But it was openly sug-
gested that their wealthy protige would be in a
position to “entertain” Honourable members at
Speaker’s dinners, and therein lay the secret of
his nomination. If this vulgar job had been per-
petrated in an obtrusive way—if the House had
decently responded to this appeal to legislative
stomachs —it might have been forgotten, like
many other jobs of a more directly injurious
nature. As it was the Speaker question became
a public scandal. The Coalition Ministry, with
all its working majority, succeeded in squeezing in
Davies by one miserable vote. Upon which the
minority upheld the dignity of the Chair by jeer-
ing at the man who had just been elected to sit
on it.

While Melville, O’Sullivan, and Co. are bang-
ing the Protection drum throughout New South
Wales, the Rev. J. E. Tenison-Woods is doing
the cause a tremendous service by showing that
-Australian coal is certain to be driven out of the
Eastern markets before many years have passed.
Such a result would affect the local Industry in a
disastrous degree. The output of New South
Wales coal has been stationary for the last three
years, and if Japan is to chip in, as J.E.T.-W.
prophesies, there must be an absolute decrease un-
less an adoption of Protection makes the home
market spread itself. And, in the light of these
circumstances, it is marvellous that Wollongong
miners are still found capable of lending their
voices to the prevailing howl for Freetrade. It
would be just as rational for undertakers to ad-
vocate the abolition of death as for New South
Wales coal-miners to vote against Protection.

Says a recent London paper
“One of two kangaroos, the gift of the Marquis of Bute to
the town of Paisley, escaped on Friday from the Brodie Park,
and an exciting chase was the result. The animal ran across
country by Westmount, along the Crow-road, hotly pursued
by some souths. On reaching Ferguslie, the kangaroo, ex-
hausted by the chase, dropped dead."
The foregoing is beautifully typical of the true
meaning of Imperial Federation. The starved old
British lion throws many a hungry eye across
sixteen thousand miles of ocean and longs to try
a plate of kangaroo-soup. If any Australian who
hankers after the joys of a closer union with the
dear old mother-in-law country will take the trou-
ble to wander down to Mrs. Macquarie's Chair
and look across the water to where a muddy,
yellow strip of mullock encumbered with heaps
of timber and stone marks the spot upon which
Lieutenant Dawes made his first little garden and
planted the first peach-trees in New South Wales
soil, he will have a fair instance of what Imperial-
ism means. Garden Island was a beautiful
green islet about which clung many historic
associations, and which enhanced the outlook
down the harbour from the crest of the bosky
knoll upon which now stands the mis-shapen Art
Gallery with its dingy, blank, unlighted facade of
dull brick and ugliness. The island was given to
the Imperial authorities in exchange for something
or other, and “improvements” were at once begun.
These have so far advanced that the island is a
hideous congeries of sheds intended for the recep-
tion of war and other material to supply the ships
of the Australian station. When Imperial Federa-
tion is properly accomplished, the Sydney Domain
will probably be turned into a drilling-ground for
the accommodation of the Chinese troops from
Hongkong.
Many people wonder why needy man go into
Parliament, and how they live whilst there. We
can give them a wrinkle. A great many members
of Parliament get large sums of money by guaran-
teeing overdrafts with banks for contractors doing
Government work. Then the department is
worked by the member, the contractor gets all
sorts of concessions, the bank gets its little 12 per
cent., the member gets his commission, and the
bleeding country gets what’s left. Of course, the
member doesn’t get paid for working the depart-
ment. Oh, dear, no ! He gets paid for guarantee-
ing the contractor’s overdraft, although he may
not be worth £5 in the world.

Editor Haddon, of the Argus, is not a man of
one idea. He has two. Anglo-Saxonism and Im-
perialism. The one long since bred out, and the
other tottering. We read that the true Anglo-
Saxon was a man with “ hay-coloured hair, blue
eyes, long back, pot belly, and short legs." He
may be met occasionally in some parts of England
but is to be found nowhere in Australia —except,
perhaps, in Collins-street. Hengist and Horsa,
the reputed ancestors of Haddon’s tribe, wor-
shipped the god Woden, who inspired them to
rob and murder all who had property or lands and
to “annex” them. If there be anything to show
a connection, it is perhaps that that god is still
worshipped at Westminster and his ghost haunts
the Argus sanctum.
The Coercion regime in Ireland is reaching, day
by day, deeper depths of folly. The latest act of
the Executive, which Is endeavouring to suppress
the rights of free speech and public meeting in
Ireland, has been to summon Editor O’Brien and
Mr. T. D, Sullivan (the Lord Mayor of Dublin)
for reporting, in the respective journals of which
they are the editors, the proceedings of meetings
held under the auspices of the proclaimed
National League. The act of placing in the police
court the Lord Mayor of Dublin, who rivals in in-
fluence, by virtue of his office, the Lord Lieu-
tenant of Ireland himsdlf, is one which the Tories
would willingly have avoided, had not their hands
been forced by the necessities of the position they
have themselves created. Probably Mr. Balfour,
and those who with him entered with such light
hearts into the work of dragooning Ireland into
quiet and content, have by this time discovered the
futility of their task, Mr. Balfour is a literary
man, and has doubtless read history. But it is a
strange evidence of the spirit of presumption
which may animate the bosom of a callous Tory
occupying his first portfolio, that he should hope
to succeed where Pitt and Peel and Beacons-
field failed. If the Tories wish to carry out the
policy they have adopted, consistently and
thoroughly, they will have to follow up their
action in summoning T. D. Sullivan by send-
ing him to gaol on the very first occasion
upon which they can get a conviction against
him, as they have already sent his police-
court colleague, William O'Brien. When this
occurs the world will have atrulv typical instance
of the kind of Government Tories wish to give to
Ireland. There is much sinister cunning in Lord
Salisb dry’s present course of action in Ireland.
He has almost succeeded in placing that country
in a dilemma. If, on the one hand, his repressive
measures drive Irish activity underground,
and provoke the bloody reprisals of the
past, he will be in a position to ap-
peal to the passion and prejudice of the
English people to confirm the wisdom of his
coercive measures. But if, as some unreflecting
friends of Ireland advise, the insults and injustice
of coercion should be borne in a spirit of lamblike
submission, the Tory leader could claim such a re-
sult as the outcome of his “ stronghanded ”
policy. The only method of evading this twofold
difficulty is contained in that dogged policy of
“ rational resistance” which Davitt and the Irish
leaders counsel, and in which they are aided and
encouraged by Labouchbre and the Radicals of
England, and silently sympathised with by Glad-
stone and the Liberals. Such a combination cannot
take very long to break the hearts of the Tory
leaders and break the back of the last Irish Coer-
cion Act.
Brutus.
The man inexorably just
From his stern virtue nought will bend ;
He tells the truth—and damns his friend.
Old times, old mem’ries, ancient trust.
And friendship, move him not a jot.
I love him not—
This Brutus no remorse can move,
With his thin lips of bitter blue.
I hold this thing for sure and true—
The traitor to his friend will prove
A traitor to his country, too.

The Referee
The action of Mr. Phil. Sheridan, managing
trustee of the N.S. W. Association Cricket Ground,
in undertaking the management of Shaw’s cricket
team, totally ignoring the Association, is likely to
at last bring matters to a head. Fur years The
Bulletin has advocated the right of the Cricket-
ing Association to the sole control of matches
played on the ground, and some few loyal
cricketers have never ceased agitating for the
same cause. Whenever the subject was likely to
crop up at an Association meeting, the Trustee
“push” were rounded up to a man and stifled
the cricketers. The Association banded over
to the trustees for the formation of the
ground £750, and although cricketers have
contributed thousands of pounds to the revenue
of the ground, the Association credit balance at
the present time is but £l6O. However, it would
appear the N.S.W. Cricket Association and
athletes generally are at last to get a fair show in
the ground. Week after week for years past have
we drawn attention to the exorbitant charges
levied on bicyclists and athletes by the ground
management. Revenue up to nearly £lO,OOO per
annum is collected by irresponsible people from
these public lands, and for that reason alone it is
well some change should now take place. Here-
tofore a balance-sheet has been shown annually,
but merely, we are told, as a matter of courtesy.

It is rather soon for the Britishers to talk

The A.J.C. are making some big strides
for the season of 1888. The added money for the
“ Metrop.” is to be increased to £lOOO, the Cham-
pagne Stakes goes up to a similar amount, and
no race is to have less than 200 sovs. added money.
No two-year-old racing is to come off at the spring
meeting. # # ,
The gallant attempt was worthy a better
came. After the running for the Canterbury
Gold Cup, three young fellows made an attempt
to annex the trophy, but were just noticed by the
caretaker as they were making off with it.

Nolan and M'Oarthy had a give-and-take
battle for twenty rounds at Foley’s on Saturday
night, when a draw was declared. M'Carthy
gave most punishment, but big gloves were the
order of the night, and he was unable to give the
quietus to his weighty opponent. Foley has now
put up £5O fora 10-stone-l-and-under competition,
which should bring forth some rattling good
work.

The old old story. An unfortunate Jug-
gins was the other day induced by some Sydney
sporting and public-house-keeping geniuses to
take a hand at Nap. He was a callow youth,
who hardly knew a knave from a king, and he
had never heard even the name of the game
before. However, he played, and with so little
success that the Great Oof Bird hovered over the
teachers and enriched them to the extent of £8 10s.
And the young pupil went out and wept some.
But he came back next night, for so deeply does
the game fascinate the guileless Juggins, and they
taught nim some more. And their teaching was
sound, for behold when they sat down to play the
teachers had much gold, to wit £7200. and Juggins
hadn’t even half-a-crown. And when they arose
next morning. Juggins had the £7200, and a
lot more, and his teachers had not even a half-
crown.

The ways of the sporting prophet are
devious, and in Sydney they seem to be more
devious than in other places. Not long ago the
prophet of a weekly paper tipped “ No. 8 ” to win,
but when a swell hailed him on the course just as
he was booking a little bet, and inquired what he
was backing, he replied carelessly. ‘ ‘ Oh, I'm just
putting a small sum on No. 1. ” “ But, didn’t
you tip No. 8 ?” said the swell, in an aggrieved
tone. “Oh, yes, I did; but that was for the
public. This is for myself.” And he didn’t seem
to think there was anything remarkable about his
conduct, either.

Young Mr. Stamper, a well-known Eng-

off to visit the girl he doted on. While travelling
30 miles an hour down a steep hill, poor Stamper

his last mash. This ought to be a solemn warn-
ing to young men against going courting on two
thin wheels. Better stick to the old-fashioned
wings of Love.

The horse-reporter of the Peak Downs
(Q.) Telegram went down to see Melbourne Cup
last year, and was so pleased with the show that
he evidently felt as if he were going up to heaven
between two hot pancakes, while all the little
angels were pouring hot treacle down his back:
“ Such an absorbing interest as is displayed is
mesmeric. It is a syren that throws her beauti-
ful arms around you, and, unresisting, some ink
to slumber in her embrace. They may awake
refreshed, or they may never awake ruined.” We
shall be deeply interested to know how the young
man from Peak Downs feels at the Cup this year.

Edward Courtney, the Yankee sculler

Courtney to be all that fancy painted him, but is
sufficiently good form to revive the old question
of what he really could do if his heart were in the
right place. It must be some years now since the
Yankee caused, or sanctioned the sawing of his

No more must be said about the disreput-

Certain flash Sydney bookmakers know
altogether too much for this world. One of their
best tricks is to emerge from a cab in a crowded
street without paying their fare, and when the
miserable Jehu hangs round and tries to collect
the same they have him run in for loitering. The
cabbies are getting rather tired of this trick, and
are planning vengeance, and in this connection
they might take a hint from a Ballarat hotel-
keeper, whose free lunch was resorted to by the
whole Stock Exchange for yea's whenever it felt
a sinking about the weskit. He filed his schedule
at last, and among the cans as of his insolvency he
stated that his wife had lost the use of her right
hand through the constant cutting of sandwiches
for loafing sharebrokers. They took to paying
after that.

The retort valiant from a very
pretty witness in the Adelaide police-court lately.
When examined by a lawyer as to whether she
was ever drunk, she replied, “Just as drunk as
you get sometimes, Mr. Blank.” “ Where have
you seen me drunk?” “At my house, on beer

A Melbourne parson, speaking at a recent
public meeting called to discuss the New Hebrides
question, said that the Soudan Contingent, of
glorious memory, should be sent to Havannah
Harbour to maintain British (i.e., Bible and cocoa-

The long-expected and much-advertised
“ Harbour Lights ” opened at Sydney Royal on
Saturday evening, and made aim >at aa big a strike
as was anticipated. S ill wbei viewed by the
naked eye ot ttia child of wraih the drama does
not teem to present quite so many points aa mignt
have been expected. Apart from the glowing
scenery. Its strongest feature is probaoly its
lucidity—it is as clear aa a dog with a bread basket
on top of it hidden behind a sack of glue. The hero
is a sea-hor«e in the service of the lady who is Pre-
eminent in Grief, and he has a sweeiheart named
Dora whose adopted sister was previously engaged
to an object in boots, but left him, and was
seduced by the unprincipled squire, which same
entraps Dora into his ancestral halls one dark
evening when he is all alone, his guests having
fled from him when he asked them to endorse a
bill, and hauls her all over the shop till her lover,
who had shipped on the road to burst the collar
of the squire’s distant relative and to choke him a
little, comes in and smites him on the mouth,
and he is blown up by the spectre with the boots.
Next the publican’s daughter is thrown out of atrap
on her head, and her mother being soured by the
receipt of a bad half crown which she afterwards
gives away by mistake to a marine, then goes
and falls down a hatchway on top ot a sea-cook
with a basin of soup, in her efforts to find the
captain whom she had been informed by a man
who lib a match on her bonnet was generally
perched on top ot the funnel—but we have lost
the thread of this sentence and must try again.
The image with the boots having been squared by
the mhn whose collar was burst under a dry arch
prepares, contrary to the advice of his mother—a
lady of the clump-soled description—to fly with
his girl to a fairer land across the treacherous pea-
green sea, bub his mother casts the girl into the
bounding waves, and he is stood on his head by
the officer already mentioned, or if he wasn’t
mentioned he ought to have teen,
who is a little ahead of a
policeman, having got out by
the back door just as the foorce
came in at the front and found
his wife in a dishevelled con-
dition, but supported by the
sailor who shied the publican’s
daughter out of the trap on her
head. Meanwhile we have lost
sight of the girl who was spilt
into the sea, and must go back
to report that a stern invader
comes sbinnirg along the shore
in search of her, while an object
which is evidently intended for
a human being goes head first
into the raging surf, and walla

hanging to a perpendicular cliff

hour Lights” is replete with thrilling incident,
and though its success depends more on scenery
than on artistic power, it is supported by a strong
cast. A few particulars regarding the same will
be found in a future issue. For the present we
are exhausted, and must pause for a rest,

We arrived at Sydney Gaiety in good time
and swung by our tail in a front seat, till the cur-
tain arose, and the troubles of “ Shamus
O'Brien” were laid bafore the sultry public in five
acts. Shamus, we believe, is strictly original, but
still, like most heroes of Irish drama, he reminded
us a good deal of something we had seen before.
When alive he was an animal of large discourse who
was mixed up with an Irish rising at a time when
old hashed rebel was for sale at a remarkably low
figure, and he rose so high that it is a marvel he
ever got down again. Whenever he met the
Saxon oppressor in force he chawed his ear
off and kept it for a trophy, and in return the
tyrant chased him through his native bogs and
made it hot for him.
They chased him with thimble 3 . and chased him
with care,
They pursued him with forks and hope ;
They threatened his life with a railway share,
ti They charmed him with smiles and soap.
As a rule, however, he managed to keep in front,
and flitted like a baleful spook amid mountains
and precipices, and over slippery places where a
healthy cat could hardly find a foothold,
while the panting Sassenach toiled in his
rear and aimed stink-pots at his head.
Sometimes the enemy got up on him, and
set the house on fire while he was asleep, but he
always awoke in time to pump on the conflagra-
tion ; sometimes they captured him and carried
him away on a horse, but this generally ended in
him carrying away the horse; and once they
were about to hang him but he opened the window
and went out. He was assisted in nis troubles by
a holy father and a colleen, and he was harassed
by the mouldy bailiff without whom no Irish
drama would be complete, but he triumphed over
them all and lived, we believe, to a great age.
Mr. Dampier made a brilliant hero out of Shamus,
but we are inclined to think it wasn t fehamus so
much as Dampier who brought down the house ;
Miss Lily Dampier was a colleen who was worth
all the trouble the 1 Irish patriot took on her ac-
count; and Mr. W. K Baker fixed up the villain-
ous colonel to the satisfaction of all concerned.
The priest was a weary iteration of 250 other
priests we have met with in simitar dramas, and
the Irish major was the same old major as before.
As for the bailiff he is invariably a lantern jawed,
short-haired alligator, and he also was exactly
what might have been expected. Give us an Irish
drama for once, please, without the priest and the
bailiff.

“ Ingomar,” that leggy Goth with the big

comes down with a dull, sickening thud every

Parthenia, the Greek maiden in the long white
robe, repeats her last year’s triumph, and Bill
Holloway, when he exhibits his manly counten-
ance with the door-mat on his jaw in the part of
Ingomar, also repeats something, bub we have for-
gotten the name of it. Owing to the secession of
Mr. Charles Holloway the part of Polydore, the
miser, is executed amid circumstances of peculiar
atrocity by Mr. Norman. The rest of the cast is
as good as before, though the Timaroh’a petticoat
has not grown any longer, and business at the
Criterion is remarkably active.
“ Galled Back ” is announced at Her
Majesty’s for Saturday next, on which occasion
Miss Kate Bishop makes hor first appearance at

Paolo Macari, and though his mighty figure is
several times larger than that of the ordinary
Italian conspirator—the one who conspires with a
hand-organ and a monkey—a great success is
anticipated.

WRECK OF THE DERRY
CASTLE.
THE STORY OF THE SURVIVORS.
This is a thrilling story of the sea. Not one of
those that the Marryatts, Coopers, and Clark
Kussella have evolved, bur, a true tale of misery,
stiff-ring, peril; of eigiit strong men cast away on
a desolate island for more than a third of a year,
enduring and fighting hardships which are
shuddeiing to relate.
There arrived recently at the port of Melbourne
afterate mpestuous voyage, a small sailing schooner
of but 48 tons, the Awarua, bringing with her the
survivors of the ba quo Derry Castle, eight strange
looking beings, in clothing of stranger description;
hats made of birds’ feathers, boots made of seal
skins, their hair long and unkempt, and their faces
covered witn thick beards. Such men are not
given to exaggeration. Let them tell their
story :
We sailed from the port of Geelong, Aus., on
the 10th of March last in the Derry Castle, an iron
barque of 1367 tons, with 17,300 bags of wheat,
for Falmouth, Eng. She was commanded by
Captain Gctfe, and had a crew of 22 officers and
men and one passenger onboard. Early on the
morning of the 20ch March, with all sails set and
the vessel making 12 knots an hour, she ran full
head on to Eaderby Island, one of the Auckland
Islands, some 200 miles south of New Ze.land.
Five minutes after she struck she commenced to
settle, head down, heavy seas broke over her, and
the men were either washed overboard or jumped
into the tempestuous sea lashing the rock-bound
coast, which could now be seen not more than 200
yards distant. Eight—the passenger and seven
seamen—managed to reach the shore, scantily clad,
cut, bruised and bleeding, but the remainder of
the 22 souls perished in the waves. Daylight
brought with it new horrors, for pointed out by
the ravenous sea hawks ghastly sights were seen.
Among the seaweed at the foot of the clifls the
captain, chief officer, and an able seaman lay dead,
mutilated not only by the surf and cruel rocks,
but by the savage seahawks as well. The bodies
were tenderly borne to shallow graves by the men
who were themselves in living graves and given
kindly sepulture. The sur rivers were in a most
deplorab’e condition; they had neither fire, nor
food, except t hell fish, which was very scarce, and
but little covering, while autumn had set in, and
winter was approaching in a bleak southerly lati-
tude. The men suffered t eveiely from rheumatism
and pains in their hidnejs, caused by their feet
being continually cold and wet from contact with
the marshy ground. A thatched hut of grass was
built, and in this the castaways huddled for
warmth. After being without fire for ten days,
the passenger bethought himself of a pistol
cartridge he had in his pocket; the bullet was
extracted, a hole made in a h:atd, and the precious
caitridgeinserted, its lower portion being filled
with frayed rags. Eight men stood around to
watch the outcome, Their hearts best wildly,
they quivered with excitement, and it was a long
time before anyone dare striKe the blow which
was decide their fata. At last the rude hammer
was raised, and brought cown on the nail held on
the fulminate of the cartridge. It exp oded! the
tiny flame caught the liren, the blaze spread,
twigs were placed on, they crackled in fiery joy
and lit up the faces of the shipwrecked men, who
fell on their knees in silent thankfulness. But
the reaction set in ; a huge bonfire was built, and
the men danced about it like veritable schoolboys.
Never before had a fire meant so much t o them.
The gold of commerce was as dross beside it.
Thereafter a watch was told off, and constantly
kept, and the Are guarded with jealous care.
The sea cast up much wheat from the doomed
vessel, and a large quantity of it was dried and
stored for future use, which with seal flesh and a
fe w mussels, made up the daily fare. A part of
an old axe, left by former whalers, was found half
burled in the sand. It was sharpened with stones
and proved a verb able god-send, as the survivors
then began to construct a punt, believing that a
cairn, containing provisions for shipwrecked
Bailors, was on the main island some seven miles
distant. From the bulkhead of the vessel which
had been driven ashore, the nails were carefully
burned out, the wood saved, and the work on the
punt proceeded. For two months the sailors
laboured on their little craft. The seams were
caulked with sealskin, and the first of June saw
it successfully launched. On the 9th of June,
Sullivan and Rennie, volunteers, left their com-
rades, followed by their prayers, for the main
island ; and with their rough paddles sculled all
day long and into the night when they reached
the longed-for shore, and, to t heir great joy, found
clothing, food, tea, sugar, salt, matches, tools, etc.,
in the cairn erected by the Government of New
Zealand for the relief of castaways. One by one
the men weie conveyed to the larger island.
T 'ey still had no hoots and suffered greatly from
co.d—as snow-storms were not infrequent.
On the 9th of July a sail was seen, and the little
community was wild with delight. Signals were
shown, and at night flies were lighted, and all
Waitex anxiously for the day; with the light the
sailors’ eyes wore made glad with the sight
of the taut little craft, the Awaraa, a New
Zealand schooner, which had come down to the

grateful to you for the bottles of Warner s safe
cure and safe pills you so generously presented to
us on our arrival in Melbourne, when you became
aware we were suffering from rheumatism and
kidney difficulties, contracted through exposure
while shipwrecked on the Auckland Islands. We
have all used the safe remedies with the most
gratifying results. In fact we are now well.

these medicines have done for us they will do for

Now comes the witching season of the
year when men lav down to yawn, and “ skeeters ”
must be led. Now do they drink hot blocd and
do such deed* as juicy new-chutns qua l e to think
upon. Therefore this is tire right moment tor
mentioning that the mosquito is a much under-
rated animal. Thoughtless youths and gentle
maidens put h*m down as an ugly carnivorous
beast composed of four thin legs, two wings, and
a drop of hun an gore—and treat him accordingly.
But, fix the mosquito under a microscope, and
“Presto! ihe tiny, dirt-coloured speck has
vanished, and in its place appears the most
radiant and gorgeous creature which the mind
can conceive of. The wings are of pale amber,
the legs and thorax magenta, the body dark
green, the eyes purplish black and shining like
ebony. Compared with this pomp and magnifi-
cence of decoration the brightest and most vivid
of the painters’ pigments are muddy.” A distin-
guished scientist is responsible for the portion of
this essay which is placed between inverted
commas, and onr bard will further improve the
subject.
“A petition was presented to-day, signed
by 12,066 members of the Women’s Temperance
Union, specially directed against the employment
of women as barmaids.” Humph I It isn't so
much the glass or two of drink, but the nasty,
good for-nothing baggages who serve them, my
dear.
Mr. Jimmy Munro, M.L.A., has been
earnestly beseeching tne Commissioners of Mel-
bourne Centennial Exhibition to forbid the sale of
wines and spirits at their forthcoming show.
About twice a week, on an average, James puts
his tongue in his cheek and asks some modest
little favour like this, with much expectation
of any good resulting except an advertisement fpr
his wily old self. We must talk to him again.

AN EPISODE OF YOM KIPPUR EVE.
MR . REDINALD DE BOOZEMUP (of the Lands, to Mr. Moses Aaron Melchisedech, of the
United Patent Oriental Back Action Loan and Discount Bank, head office, Lombard-
street, London, Capital £27,000,000): "WELL, OLD MOSES, ARE YOU GOING TO
FAST TO-MORROW?"
MR. M. A. MELCHISEDECH: "FAST! I'LL MAKE SOME OF YOUR CROWD FAST
NEXT WEEK, I PROMISE YOU."
p
ANOTHER JOY FOR EVER.
Of the beautiful mosquito
The poet blithely sings ;
He flatters through the darkness
On amber-tinted wings ;
His little legs and thorax
Are magenta in their hue,
And nestling on his bosom
Is a dab of navy-blue.
He seems a shabby varmint
At a careless, passing glari ce,
And the story of his splendour
Reads a little like romance;
But when through many lenses
That giddy fly is seen,
His rounded ribs are covered
With a coat of glowing green.
Will you swear at the mosquito
Who visits you at night,
When you know his pretty peepers
Are balls of purple light
That glitter like the diamonds
In haughty lady’s ears—
The dewdrops ’neath the sunbeams,
Or childhood’s limpid tears ?
If you knew the little stranger
(Eren now upon your track)
Made play with a proboscis
Of burnished, ebon black,
Would those piercing purple peepers
Catch the frown upon your brow—
Wo aid his stealthy visitations
Vex you then, as they do now ?
The kindly heart of Nature
Is shown in little things ;
She gave that gorgeous splendour
To the “ skeeter's” legs and wings—
Yes, Nature gave the insect
Her richest, choicest dower,
That you might spare his beauty
In the solemn midnight hour.
AFTER YEARS.
Long ago we parted from him—many a golden
year ago,
Then our locks were black as thunder—now they
are as white as snow.
And we met him on the pavement on the Mel-
bourne Eastern Hill,
And we said (about his poems), “Have you got
the old thirst still ?
The old thirst Heliconian —dost with Apollo
clink ?”
“Can you set ’em up,” he whispered ; “do you
hold it for a drink ?"
THE WAIL OF THE WIFE.
Those Impudent vixens who serve at the bar,
What mischief and trouble they make !
We all know what brazenfaced wretches they are
And what simpletons do for their sake ;
In the pockets of husbands their photos, are found
Together with bits of dyed hair—
John’s drinking and flirting all day, I’ll be hound,
Wnile I haven’t a shilling to spare.
As a wife and a mother I beg to protest
Against giddy girls in hotels—
Just look at the way they are painted and dress’t
To work their iniquitous spells.
I wouldn’t believe any good of a minx
Employed as a barmaid, so there!
The way that Jonn’s wages are wasted in drinks
Is wicKed, I xeally declare.
If Premier Parkes has a morsel of sense
Hb’il order the barmaids to go ;
I won’t hear one word in the creatures defence—
I reckoned them up long ago.
My own pet aversions are Lotties and Mauds :
All sensible wives should beware
Of those artful, made-up, sly delusions and frauds;
01 a barmaid I cannot a-bear.
T OO THIN.
Jimmy Munro, now, what is the use
Of drivelling on about water,
When the succulent grape has such beautiful
juice?
And are you, dear Jimmy, so precious obtuse
As to see ho delight in rum mingled with spruce ?
Dry up this moment, and go to the deuce—
You ought to know better, you oughter.
Drink is a curse, as we always agree—
A horrible curse, in a measure ;
The home of the boosser is frequently dree;
Is that any reason why poets like we
Should swear off for ever from soda and B. ?
It s all very well to do business on tea,
But brardy’s the liquor for leisure.
Jimmy Munro, you’ve a hatchet to grind
In running the teetotal fad, sir ;
It pays you to pose as a friend of mankind—
Brings grist to your mill from the godly-inclined.
Bu r :, bless you ! we’re not so uncommonly blind
That we can’t see your purpose a-lurking behind -
Jimmy, we’re not to be had, sir
Shove the good causa up Iniquity Hill—
Confusion to sinners who’d thwart it!
But water needs summat to take off the chill.
So, why do you spout tommy nonsense until
We look round about us for something to kill ?
The good of this bogus petition is nil—
You only want scribes to report it.
Jimmy Munro, are you on for a drink ?
Jusc give the pizon a name, sir ;
The “bob” ’s in our pocket, and pleasant its
chink—
Water s all right for to wash out the sink—
Nobody’s looking, so tip us the wink—
You murmured “unsweetened with soda,” we
think ?
Certainly 1 ours is the same, sir.
ABORIGINALITIES.
For the historian who wishes to write up the
legends of Amt, alia, the “ Glue-pot ” on Biscuit
tiat (S. A.) would furnish a good text for many a
gruesome tale. It is a heaving swamp filled with
mud as tenacious as half-boiled glue ; in summer
it is little larger than a well —whose depths have
never been sounded by living man—but in winter
it spreads over two or three acres of ground, and
everything that comes within its reach is slowly
and remorselessly sucked down—down —down to
unfathomable depths below. It never gives up
anything on which it has laid a hold : the man
whose feet are once caught in that slimy grave is
lost as completely as if he had been eaten, and
his bones ground to impalpable powder and scat-
tered over the seas. Away back in the golden
days of the 50’s the Glue Pot invited in many a
traveller bound overland to Ballarat, and none of
them came out. They walued gently and unsus-
pectingly into a bottomless tomb, and probably
each of the succeeding 30 years has seen their
sodden bones sucked down to a lower and still
lower depth, until at last they find rest on the
adamantine pillars of the earth. Sometime in
1856, 200 guileless Chinamen came over this road
with a whits bullock-driver to convey their swaga
and officiate as guide. When they camped
at night it was also his business to
round up stragglers, and on the evening
when they halted by the Glue Pot he sta-
tioned himself between his flock and the swamp
and whenever a Chinaman approached he flicked
him back with his bullock-whip. But one doomed
Ah Sin escaped hie notice and went into the
swamp to hunt for something—Confucius only
knows what; fish, very likely ; frogs, perhaps ;
probably crabs—and was caught. His brethren
danced round the back explaining the position to
each other, but doing nothing ; then the bullock-
driver fished for the Mongol vainly with a rope,
but failed to gat him ou f , and all this time the
Glue-Pot was rising and spreading, till at last the
lost Ah Sin was many yards away from firm ground
and hopelessly oat of reach. All that night he
raised a mournful “hurrah” at intervals—it was
the only word of English he knew—and in the
morning, when the caravan moved on and left
him to his fate, he was stiil hurrahing in a cracked,
beseeching voice that sounded like the wail of a
lost soul. It was 21 hours before he was swal-
lowed as far as the shoulders, and in that period
a dozen travellers had been attracted by the
trange sound of Chinese cheering in the Glue-
Pot, and had tried to rescue him, and, failing,
had passed on. Another day came, and only his
face and one arm appeared above the surface, and
still that loyless ''hurrah’' brought passers-by to
the edge of the swamp, till at last, in the after-
noon, his head disappeared below the grasping
slime, and only the stiffened arm of the lost
Chinaman remained above the surface. A few
hours later it also vanished; the foredoomed
Asiatic had sunk into the bowels of the earth,
and his soul had gone to be for ever with Joss
Confucius on the Heavenly Hoang-Hn,
* * *
The fact that all flesh is grass is once more
exemplefled in these columns. One bright Sunday
morning last August, when the birds were singing
sweetly, and the voice of the bounding kangaroo
was raised in that sorrowful chant which so mad-
dens the wild, foreign emu, the soul of Dr.
of Croydon (N.Q.) parsed away, and he went on
his lass visit to find out what had beesme of all
his patients. The funeral was fixed for noon tie
same day, and all Croydon and its dog turned out
to follow the procession, and as each dog brought
a friend along with him, and as more dogs joined
the caravan en route, it came to pass at last that
the show consisted mainly of dogs. Yet the pro-
ceedings were carried out with tolerable decorum
until at last the forward dogs roused an emu, and
passed the word to the middle dogs, and they
mentioned it to the dogs at the rear, whereupon
they all started off in chase. Then the afflicted
mourners tailed away behind the dogs, and the
hearse followed at a canter till it got bushed, and
the remains went round and round for an hour or
so, vainly trying to find the way to their
last resting-place. At the end of that
time the procession began to straggle back
along with the dogs and one dead emu, and ulti-
mately the cemetery was reached, and the coffin 1
was about to be lowered into the earth, when a
new trouble intervened. The grave-digger had
gone down two feet, and then, coining on the bed"
rock, he had stopped, and the perspiring mourners
laid down the dead emu to protest against the in
decency of this arrangement, and demanded that
the deceased should be treated with proper
respect. The discussion grew decidedly warm,
and at one time It seemed as if the dogs were
likely to be sooled on to the sexton, hut that
public servant, with great presence of mind,
pointed out that he had fixed matters so that the
rocky formation might prevent the doctor sinking
any lower and gettieg into a warmer climate than
Croydon, and that, though he might stick out
considerably, it would be ail the better for his
soul. The explanation was ultimately accepted
as satisfactory, and the proceedings closed in a
harmonious spirit, after which the grief-stricken
crowd adjourned to ‘ wet” the emu at an adja-
cent groggery.

FOR SALE, fine GOAT and two KIDS.
Dye hear that now; “goat and two kids?” But
after all what is one goat among so many babies 2
And following this comos another point which we
wjull like Alfred Bennett of the Noose to explain
—how comes it that the great immoral outrage
journal should have a monopoly of this chfid-for-
sale business, and why are the infants all wanted
at suburban post-offices ? Does Bennett imagine
that an offspring will go into a letter-box ? Are
the little unfortunates simply to be shoved in and
left to squall among the book packets till called
for ? And does it never occur to Alfred, when he
thus connives at a system by which babies are
given away along with £2O notes, that he is estab-
lishing a precedent by which he himself may one
day be given away along with half-a-pound of
butter ? Alfred was a baoy himself once, and we
J riae t 0 as ’ £ b i m how he would have liked, in those
early days wh>n he used to try to gat his hind leg
into his mouth over the back of his head, if he
had picked up a paper and seen himself advertised
therein, to be given away in a naked condition
and no questions asked, and on top of that
£2O offered to get him out of the road. And, by
' lhs - va A- a nO N question arises hero. Some cf the


Infants seem to be for sale, and in the case of
others the mothers are prepared to come down
handsomely to get them taken away. In the in-
stance of the baby which is “ open one month,” it
is hard to say which way the coin goes. If Alfred
Bennett had been offered to the public in this
fashion in his early days, we are inclined to think
he would have had no takers ; but perhaps he
was the sort of baby that wouM have gone off beat
gratis and in a shut condition. Bat sines the
Noobe has gone in for this line of business, why
doesn’t it transact the trade openly 1 Why aren't
the babies on view at the office —a row of
them tied by one leg to the wall, instead of being
applied for in an underhand way at a suburban
post-offloa i The thing looks moan all round,
somehow, and we are inclined to think the Noose
had batter shut up its baby-market, and make up
the loss out of those “ads.” from mysterious
clergymen who are prepared to explain how
epilepsy can be cured for 13 stamps.

asked the boss for the loan of the tip-dray, and
on being asked the purpose, explained that there
was not a stone on the coorse, and he wanted to

Tae Tasmanian Catholic Standard is

Nearly every man Jack of them was slain, and a
hundred to one those of them who weren’t
slain were slewed, and hardly one of them
owned a name that a man could pro-
nounce without taking his clothes off to get air,
uud they died in places that sound like the yell a
goat gives when he is hit in the eye by a very bad
egg. We presume the list is put in with a view
to doing the agreeable to MacSwiney, but we
really think in that case Ujnald Maol na-mBo
might have been left out, An ancestor who spelt
his final name with a small “ n,” and then put a big
“ B” in the centre, is no credit to anybody, and
if he could pronounce such a syllable as “mBo”
even when he was alive his mouth must have been

In Victoria there lived, a few years ago,
two neighbouring squatters, known to the
fraternity of sundowners as Dickey the Lamb, and
Black Anderson. The bush Bohemian is much
given to labelling bis patrons with such sobriquets,
which are meant to convey a rough estimate of
the character of the squatters who bear them.
Dickey the Lamb was regarded by all wayfarers as
an amiable gentleman of sleek appearance and
pious proclivities, who never hunted a casual
visitor away from his homestead with bad
language and a stockwhip, and who, though re-
markably close, might be cajoled out of a pannikin
of damper-dust, short measure, if the solicitor
quoted scripture pretty freely, and comported
himself with piety. Black Anderson, on the con-
trary, was a bold, harsh, beady-eyed man, of
swarthy sinister aspect, who never saw a sun-
downer without endeavouring jto curse him off
the face of the earth, or letting an ugly dog out
at him. Mr. Anderson's politics were known to
most of the footpads who passed that way, and
they seldom whistled him up, but usually bore off
to the East. But one soft summer’s eve, a weary
and perhaps “tangled” stranger, misled by direc-
tions, struck the homestead of Mr. Anderson,
and, thinking he was addressing Dickey the
Lamb, endeavoured to “ touch him ” for the usual
donation of flour, and tea, and tough old
mutton. “He that glveth to the poor lendeth
to the Lord,” said the pilgrim with the

big trump. “Does he?” was the curt response.
“Yes; and as the Psalmist says, ‘I have been!
young, and now am old ” “ And d
dirty as well,” interposed the land-owner, and the
plaintiff began to feel staggered, but he thought,
ho would try once more. “ Cast thy bread upon j
the waters ” he began, but he got no further, j
“I’ll cist you over the fence, you canting, un- ■
washed thief,” roared the squatter, and instantly
a procession of two started for the gate, the sun-
downer a little in front, and his enemy close
behind and kicking him in the back to make him
travel. He was over in the quickest time on
record, and then the two men regarded each other
for a moment with the bars between them, till at
last the dazed and dusty wanderer, speaking from
the recesses of his full heart, murmured, “ Snakes
and sawdust, what a saint!” And with that he
picked up his swag, and solemnly backed away.
Of the six judges on the Victorian Supreme
Court Bench only two —Higinbotham and Ker-
ferd—have been politicians. Of the six judges on
the N.S.W. Supreme Court Bench all have been

two in the nominee House.
John Austin, of Barwon Park (Vic.), was
the first to acclimatise the wild rabbit. The Duke
of Edinburgh spent a day at Austin Warren,
when the bunnie s were slaughtered in hundreds.
As the Dutch erected a statue to the man who
first salted fish in tubs, so should a monument be
raised to Austin for having established that most
thriving industry, rabbiting.
When the j ury was being empannelled in
the celebrated divorce case of Bishop v. Bishop, in
Melbourne, Louis Gerachel, the well-known Hebrew

jury found an 11-12ths ver jlct for the plaintiff.

pelted the Freetrade candidate with hen-fruit and
flour that he looked like a walking omelette.
The Lithgow Boy Politician advises every-
body to study politics. So do we. It is time the
rest of the population had a show.
The revenue from spirits increased by
£22,000 in N.S.W. last quarter. People must
get rid of their grief in a Freetrade country,
somehow.
The German civilisers of Samoa sell guns
to the natives at a profit of 600 per cent. No

Mr. Alfred Allen, M.P., asserts that one
good thing about him is that his political prin-
ciples will never be purchased. The same might
be said of Alfred’s little book of “ pomes.”
The butcher’s bill of England’s latest Bur-
mese war tots up 35 officers and 624 British soldiers

soldiers.
We hear it is likely that a motion will be
submitted in the N.S.W. Assembly declaring

head vacant ?
The Sydney D.T. had, the other day, a
paragraph headed “Death from Burns.” We

did not in any way refer to the fiscal condition of
New South Wales.
Subscribers to the Imperial Institute Fund
will ba glad to hear that the press is to be kept in

A member of the Victorian Assembly de-
clared, a few nights ago, that “a man who was
born a liar could not speak the truth.” That
however, is no obstacle to his being a member of
the Victorian Parliament.
The leader of the Conservative party,
according to Mr. Gillies, ought to be a man of
good social position and—a long pocket. That's

Kiag Herod would have made!
“Hi never saw such a man as Young,”
said Premier Parkes the other day of his protege,
the N.S.W. Speaker— “ whenever I rise in the
’Ouse to try and get ’im hout of a difficulty, ’e
halways rules me hout of horder.”
Ex-Speaker Lalor having resigned his seat
for Grant, held uninterruptedly by him for a
quarter of a century, Mr. Stutt (licensed vic-
tualler) and Mr. Mirams (teetotal local-optionist)
are candidates for the vacancy. As Bacchus
Marsh is the principal centre of the constituency,
Mirams ought to be nowhere.
Two ex-Speakers of the Victorian Assem-
bly are just now in Sydney—Peter Lalor, who is
lamentably ill, and Sir Francis Murphy (Vic
toria’s flrst]Speaker), who is old and gouty. Sir
Francis is by profession a doctor of medicine, and
has made heaps of money as a squatter. His
father was Governor of Cork Gaol.
The only part of the N.S.W. Colonial
Secretary’s office which is at all the worse for
wear is the coat-of-arms over the Macquarie-street
entrance. The grand old insignia of England s
greatness is—in marvellous contrast with the rest
of the building—covered with bright-green moss.
A big allegory here sticks out a mile.
The Anti-Chinese movement proceeds
under difficulties at Bundaberg (Q ) The other
day, Selby, Freethought lecturer, &c.,was engaged
to deliver an oration on the subject of the yellow
paralyser, and the local bellman was instructed to
ring up the denizens of the one-horse city and in-
vite then! to attend. But it chanced that that
humble necessary official was a Salvationist of
the most hallelujah description, and he declined
to interfere in the matter unless Selby could bring
forward satisfactory proof that he was saved.
Selby, unhappily, wasn’t saved, by a whole jugfull,
and didn’t expect to be, and on learning this the
holiness man resigned his commission and went
home. A sinful bellman will ba engaged next
time.
It is stated in the papers that the “ men
in the S.M. Herald office are almost unanimous
in wanting a public-house opened for certain hours
on Sundays,” and that they “desire a special
public-house to be kept open every night between
11 and 12 o’clock” for their own particular benefit.
Why don’t the Herald people follow the example
of the Melbourne Argus and get a pub. of their
own in the establishment ? But who’d have
thought that alcohol was so popular in the
Herald office ? Can it ba that there's anything
in the nme of the paper itself ? The Melbourne
Herald staff are the main support of the Queen’s
Head and the Royal Oak A fraction of the cus-
tom goes now to the Belle Yue since the office was
removed to Little Collins-street, but then S, V 1
Winter’s room looks direct into the bar of that
pub,, and with the aid of a powerful field-glass he
can see whether a reporter is having soda-straight

sary Reforms,” alludes to Jack Haynes as an

A correspondent to

As the N.S.W. Min-
is* ers were travelling in
the bush lately, the atten-
tion of the Postmaster-
General was repeatedly
drawn to the anomalous
kind of letter-boxes which
occurred on the roadside
as they drove along.
These boxes varied from
a sizeable tank to a bis-
cuit-tin nailed to a> post
But when they dwindled
down to a sardine-tin
strung on a sapling,
Premier Parke s, with a
loud guffaw, cried : “I
say, Roberts, I’ll have to
report you if you don’t
look after your country
offices better than this.”
Which remark of the
Premier’s, be it said,
passes in the back-blocks
for a bon mot.
“G. Davis, Pig-sticker,” has been going
for the B.P. in the columns of the Lithgow
(N.S.W.) Enterprise, and says, inter alia:— “l
must say, in my humble opinion, that Mr. Caul]
field understands about as much of Protection or
Freetrade policy as the pig I stuck last Friday
understands about the working of an 81-ton gun.”
The simile is rather Mud J. Haynesian.
Mr. Ellis, one of the Australian Cobdenite
gods, must, after all, be a curious brand of a free-
trader. At a recent meeting called for the pur-
pose of forming a Newcastle branch of the Free-
trade Association, ho stated that the sugar-trade
in the colony of N.S. W had grown up under a ss.
per ton duty, and that if this duty were rescinded
it would mean Inevitable ruin to the industry.
He likewise made a statement to the effect that
Arnott’s biscuit factory had managed to keep
that fiscally afloat with a duty on biscuits, and
to take this duty off would ba to cripple the busi]
ness—in fact when he heard that Treasurer Burns i
contemplated taking it off, he went to see him
about it. As a matter of fact when the duty on
biscuits was increased in N S.W., Swallow and
Ariel!, of Melbourne, found that it would pay to
establish a factory at Sydney, and made prepara-
tions accordingly, but when the duty was re-
scinded they found it impossible to compete
against outside makers, so they now make all
their biscuits in Melbourne, where they get the
benefit of protection, and export them to N, S.W.
The Argus says that “ Mr. Gannson
points to himself as a proof that the liberal use of
the rod in childhood does not effect its purpose.”
Editor Haddon remarks, “ This is a melancholy
instance of vice triumphing over the birch.”
Ignatius Feigl, the printer of the Mel-
bourne Herald, is something of a celebrity. He
was born in Bohemia, and the experiences of a
long and busy life include the printing of the first
copy of the Melbourne Age, which came into
existence in 1854, and, after 20 years’ hard strug-
gling, went ahead like wildfire and made the for-
tunes of its proprietary. Instead of “grafting”
away at leading articles, as Ebenezer had to do,
David Syme makes the grand tour, imports choice
specimens of cattle, and sells one of his country
seats to the Governor. Feigl is reputed to be
worth a cent or two.
Jumping Moses I what a mis-llt—•
Haynes an “ ultra democrat” !
Though for many things he is fit,
We must quite object to that I
Tell us, is it democratic,
Is it red-republican,
To embrace the acrobatic
Foolery of the Orangeman ?
What d’ye call it when we ravage
Other people’s “ ancient faith,”
As the self-called “ Denom. Savage”
When he saw the Orange wraith ?
Do you call it ‘' democratic
Is it “ultra,” when he barks,
This “discreetly-changed” fanatic,
In his servile praise of Parkes ?

Benjamin succeeds Cain as Mayor of Mel-
bourne. It is earnestly desired that the new mam
when he invites h's fellow-citizents to the festive
“ hop,” won’t request a favoured forty to “ soorf ”
the best vittles in a private room. To keep the
best jelly for the cream is blank mange-y.
* * ♦
We have received from what appears to
be a reliable source an explanation of the reasons
which induced Mayor Cain, of Melbourne, on the
occasion of his late bill, to regale a few swagger
guests on the fat of the land in an upper room,
while the bulk of the visitors were left to batten
on slabs of duff and get stomach-ache in the re-
mote down below. Our correspondent points out
that many mayors use a fork for a toothpick and
a napkin for a handkerchief, and that many of
Mayor Cain’s friends might possibly be affected
the same way, in which case he may have wished
to conceal their bad manners. In support of this
theory he sends us a napkin which he picked up
in the aforementioned supper-room, and which
bears the unmistakable print of a naked human
nose. Also he forwards a footprint executed in
There was a flower-show in New Zealand
some considerable time ago, and the local Gover-
nor was there along with his wife, and one of f he
aides-de-camp was there, too, poor beggar, and he
looked as if he was en joy ing himself thoroughly. The
Governor’s lady was presented with another bunch
of vegetables about once a minute, and she flip-
pantly passed them over to the miserable aide to
carry, till he seemed to be light porter to a
Chinese garden, and as he also bore the lady s
shawl and one or two other fixings, his arms were
stretched to their utmost capacity, which was
anthropoir orphically immense. His hat was
tipped on one side, too, and as he couldn’t spare a
hand he had to straighten it surreptitiously
against the wall, and he was covered with per-
spiration, and he wanted—oh ! so badly—to blow
his nose, but he couldn’t reach it without dropping
all the verdure, and there was no girl about whom
he could rely upon to blow it for him, Nobody
took the least notice of his misery, except our-
selves, The Governor stalked along and didn't
carry anything, even brains, and his lady con-
tinued to load up with flowers and pass them to
her tottering stipendiary follower, till they were
heaped up higher than his head, and he would
have liked to strike and say that he wouldn’t
hump any more adjective grass, but the poor
garden coster’s donkey daren’t—it was more than
his place was worth. Barring the calves, he
might as well have been a flnnKey, and yet hun-
dreds of young British aristocrats rush for a billet
as private secretary and dog-washer to a colonial
Governor, and seem to regard it as an enviable
position. But perhaps they don’t anticipate hav-
ing to go out in a broiling sun and buy the carrots
for the gubernatorial dinner, to say nothing of
having to set the gubernatorial hen, and take the
lord’s old dress suit to be dyed. If they saw these
things ahead, aides-de-camp would probably be-
come scarce.

This stately paragraph comes to ua from
Sydney University. Gloom has settled with
leaden wings on a stately hash-house in Darling-
hurst. She was a blonde angel with blue eyes
and a hay-band scalp-lock, and he was a logger
of high degree with a beautiful duck of a mous-
tache, and a diamond breast-pin. She cultivated
several of the more congenial virtues and a taste
for patchouli. He was renowned for the cut of
his nether garments and his most characteri >tic
quality was billiards. She had a husband, a com- |
mercial traveller, away on a tour to the remotest
parts of Northern Queensland, andhe had a wife—in
England. In the absence of her parson-bestowed
spouse she gradually evolved a partiality for
chewing the radiant hasher s eyebrow, and de-
veloped an undue fondness for the encirclement of
her waist by his humerus, ulna ard radius, the
while his jewel-adorned phalanges dallied in child-
like playfulness with her burnished flaxen curls.
’Twas sweet to press her throbbing spheroid
against his manly thorax and to listen to the
rhythm of a heart that beat for her. For hours
would she sit upon his tweed-clad femur, her arm s
about bis vertebral atlas, and her cheek against
his malar-bone, while the music of dulcet and
surreptitious osculation would occasionally fol-
low the mellifluous impact of four lips with but a
single thought—and that one yum-yum ! She
had five children, a dyspeptic aunt, a mother-in-
law afflicted witu a chronic catarrh, a “slavey
subjec t to epileptic Acs, a tar-brush-plum aged
parrot given to obscenity, four white mice in a
broken-down cage, a cat which had three days
pret iousiy added six lives to the sum of the
world’s quivering protoplasm, an irascible poodle
blind in tae off eye, a lethargic tortoise, three
bantams, a canary that couldn t sing, and a mon-
key with an amputated tail. The lover urged the
blooming girl to fly—and soe fled, all of her. Ihe
entire caravan chartered an ocean liner, and made
tracks for another and, perhaps, a better clime.
The excoriated and exacerbated husband—stnpt
of his skin of worldly gear, and driven by his loss
into a state of chronic savagery—wrote a bitter
letter to the abductor of his menagerie, and sug-
gested that the levauter might have waited until
Im return and taken him along also, to feed the nm-
mals. The conscience-smitten seducer wrote back,
and in a letter f ull of contrition and remorse, a ckno w-
ledged that he was premature in his flight. He
ought to have waited and taken the husband, and
he begged forgiveness for the oversight.

The late Mayor’s ball in Melbourne was
a frost. Two thousand invitations were issued,
and the parties who received ih=m fluttered
themselves iu> o a high fever over what they were
going to wear and how they were going to get it
Brooches, bracelets, neck'aosa, earrings, andrinjs
were taken out of pawn with great sacrifice and
the prosp >.ct of hash dinners for a month af er-
wards by some of them ; and others incurred ex-
penses’for which they will not forgive Mayor Cain
for many a long day. What was the result of it
all? We burn with shame (for Mayor Cain) to
eay merely a “ small and (arly,” or what tney call
a ‘’Cind<-rella” dance — a “hop” of the most
commonc-lace and uapretentious description. And
—as it this were not enough insult— ‘ the refresh-
ments ” (wa quote from a letter written by one of
the angry guests to the Age) “ were of the stalest,
and consequently of the heaviest description ; and
the sandwiches were so stale that the butterless
bread of which they were composed refused, from
very dryness, to adhere to the small particle of
fat placed between. But ” (continues the
writer with indignant pathos) “to add insult to
injury the Mayor and Mayoress, with some of
the councillors and their friends, were holding
high revel in the Mayor’s room over one of the
best banquets ever prepared.” Shocking, wasn’t
it« But what must it have been to the writer of
the letter referred to ? She says :lam a widow
with two unmarried daughters (a naive confession
to say the least of it), both of whom were most

Another instance of the mistake made in
acclimatising that noxious animal—the fox. A
certain “ Lady Fox ” has resigned her seat on the
ccmmitteeof the Auckland (N.Z.) Kindergarten be-
cause the committee bad accepted the aid of a dra-
matic club performance. “ After considerable dis-
cussion it was decided to decline the proffered assis-
tance, as the Kindergarten, being a Christian insti-
tution, cannot recognise theatrical performances.”
So the she-fox withdrew her resignation, and the
Christian committee breathe again.

The duties of a N.S. Wales M.L A. are
pretty multifarious. He has not only to keep his
eye on local culverts, bridges, fences, ditches. &c.,
but he is expected to take delivery of diseased
constituents sent to his care, and see them safely
in the hospital, and sometimes he has to find
wives for unmarried voters who feel lonely. Not
very long ago an agricultural party from the out-
side districts dropped in on his member (an
auctioneer) in Sydney, and asked him to get him
a partner for life, and then the member and the
agricultural party tore round together for an hour
or two till they found a girl who was built that
way. It took exactly 13 hours to settle up the
whole matter, and the young man hasn’t been
heard from since. It is presumed he is happy—in
the tomb.

At La Perouse, Sydney, there lives a black
who goes by the exalted and sacred name of

into custody she was in the act of frying sausages
for this native big bug. Here is a grand example
for her Potts Point sisters : unable to soar high
enough to do homage to a white governor, her
reverence for the title causes her to fall back on

Thing of beauty clipped from the Wash-
ington special of the Baltimore American :
“ Some time ago an artists’ club cf 600 members at SydnaA
Australia, resolved to pay Mrs. Cleveland the very pretty
compliment of sending her an elegant painting illustrative
of Australian roenery. One of the members, Mr A. Robert
Pullin, was commissioned to come to Washington and pre-,
sent Mrs. Cleveland with the painting. Mr. Pullin recently
arrived at Washington, and at once addressed a courteous
note to the President, explaining the object of his visit and
asking him to accept the painting for Mrs Cleveland The
artist, with great good taste, referred to the warm feeling
which his people felt towards the United States, and ex-
pressed the hope that the bond of friendship should ever re-
main firmly cemented between the two countries. He waited
an entire week without receiving any recognition wh tever,
when he finally received a very formal letter from the Presi-
dent declinipgto accept the painting IGLover had probably
seen it —Ed. b. | Mr. Pullin was greatly chagrined, and ad-
dressed a second letter to the President, expressing hia mor-
tification that an act which was meant to show such respect
and admiration should be so indifferently received, and
stating that his countrymen could not help feeling the in-
dignity that had been put upon them This letter has never
been answered, nor has Mr. Pullin received any recognition
from the White House whatever.”
Who is Mr. A. Robert Pullin ? Well, Mr. A.
Robert Pullin is a genial and much-respected gen-
tleman who when in Sydney was both an artist
and a sign-writer. As a sign-writer he ran a
place in Market-street which he called Alfredo
House ; as an art-teacher he occupied rooms above
Grocer Kidman’s, where he was professionally
known as Roberto A. Pullin. Like most brilliant
men, he had his own little peculiarities. We don’t
know whether Mr. Pullin required to feel on his
massive forehead the warm breath of the divine
afflatus ere he would proceed to execute one of
those gorgeous pieces of trade decoration which
when sported by the baker on this side of the
street used to make the rival baker on the
other side sit up and snort ; but we do re-
member that when studying at a certain life-class
years ago he would emphatically refuse to touch
canvas for a whole evening unless he felt himsflf
prompted to the effort by that feeling of inspira-
tion which alone has ever impelled man to the
loftiest flights of genius. None of the “ 600
artis f s ” of Sydney seem to know anything about
the “ elegant painting ” of whi :h Roberto Pullin
was the fitting bearer, but there is a grim suspi-
cion that a certain personage whose name, like
that of A. Roberto Pullin, is in three pieres,
knows something about it. However, this latter
supposition may be foundationless, and it
may also ba that Grover Cleveland, though
he looks gross and puffy enough to be an
amateur of art of the sign-writing order, conceals
beneath his well fed and unspiritual exterior
artistic sympathies which would have commepfled
him to the constant companionship of a Sanzio or
a Giotto. And, for another thing, perhaps the
name of the Roberto A. Pullin who was known
to the alleged art world of Sydney, has on the pre-
sent occasion been fraudulently used by some de-
signing and unauthorised person. It is however
certain that the bearer of the signboard sent to
Murka as a token of good will really did come
from Sydney ; the use of the dear old gag about
“cementing the bonds of friendship between the
two peoples ” incontestably proves that the envoy
extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the
600 Sydney artists, whoever he was, had sat at
the feet of Consul G riffia and Plain Bill on many a
Fourth of July at Botany. We now leave the
matter in the hands of Plain William, that he
may decide whether the gross insult hereinbefore
set forth shall not be washed out in Yankee blood.

There is good foundation for the allega-
tions —first made public by The Bulletin —in re
Sj dney private bars, but nevertheless a deal of
unnecessary fu-s is being made as to the
attractiveness of these institutions by the
cold-water Pharisees of the community. A
Bulletin scribe visited some private bars—
a good many private bars, in fact —the other
night. In one of them a faded, weary, sorrow-
stained little drab glared at him with a wall-eye,
and snarled at him with a decayed buck-tooth,
and only relented when he turned to go because
she said it was so lonely, nobody had been in dur-
ing the evening —not even a cardinal. In another
bar an unkempt female tried to smile, but her jaw
was so unused to the operation that she dropped
her false teeth on the floor, and her glasaeye
tumbled out when she stooped to pick them up.
Everything was everywhere the same—salt, sand,
and sea-marsh. Even the unvarying old bottle of
“ three-star” fusel-oil was the same, and seemed
to have followed The Bulletin’s scribe round to
“fix” him. Instead of festive houris, he saw
jaded, scraggy, high-shouldered women, whose
cheeks were red with standard-paint, and whose
hair had been thieved from dead paupers. There
fs little romance in the Sydney private-bar.

Wc read in the Melbourne papers that
Mr. J. W. Peirce, member for West Melbourne
in the Victorian Legislature, recently presided
over a meeting of the Master-Hairdressers’ Asso-
ciation, The hon. gentleman is entitled to-—and
will probably receive—the thanks of posterity for
being the first man in Melbourne to introduce the
admirable sanitary institution of “ a clean towel
for each threepenny shave.” This legend was
posted on the shop formerly kept by Mr. Peirce
in Elizabeth-street, opposite the Post Office, and
probably marked the first milestone on a road
which has already led him to the City Council and
the Legislative Assembly, and may yet land him
Heaven knows where. Mr. Peirce was ex-
tremely affable to his old associates, and was
loudly cheered when he remarked that he never
looked at “Mr. Speaker’s ’ead without thinking
of the old profession.”

H.M.S. Nelson is expacted in Melbourne
“ before the 9th of November.” Cup day again,
Ex-Chief Justice Sta.well, of Victoria, who
visited Sydney not long ago, once presided at the
Beech *on h Assizus. On the morning after, as
he stood in the bar roam of the hotel awaiting the
coach, he was acoos ei by a bushman who invited
him to liquor. Sir William politely declined on
the score that he never drank intoxicants. But
bushy persisted, and to get rid of nim the judge
consented to have a buttle of soda-water.
“ Have what yon blooming well like you gave
my old woman twelve months yesterday and she
d well deserved it,” remarked the grateful
yokel.
* # *
It is.also related that ex- Chief Justice Stawell,
when at the Bar, was once defending a prisoner in
the Criminal Court on some charge or other. The
accused was a wild bnsbman, who appeared in
the dock with hair unkempt, a grizzly overgrown
beard, Crimean shirt, no vest or collar, and with
a scowl on his ill-looking countenance. He leant
over the dock with his elbows stretched out.
“ Look at him, gentlemen,” said the learned
counsel for the defence, “ are you going to judge
of that man’s acts by the same lofty standard that
you would apply to a civilised and educated man ?
What is he, gentlemen, but a mere wild beast,
irresponsible for his deeds ? ” The prisoner, who
had been quietly chewing a lump of tibacco, and
looking as if he didn't care a brass farthing for
the whole proceedings, lazily pulled up his elbows,
and exclaimed : “ Who do you call a wild beast ?
Mind what you’re talkin’ about! ” The eloquent
Stawell seemed a bit flabbergasted at this protest
from his client, and spoke more respectfal-llke of
him durieg the rest of his oration.

“ Viator ” wrote in a recent S.M. Herald
a lot of marmaladey nonsense about Australian
aborigines, and in ore place spoke pathetically
about their “gentle loves ” This is delicious 1 Fancy

sneaking with erotic tread into some camp of a
hostile tribe while the swart Capulets are looked
fast in the ebony embraces of sleep. He raises
bis love-directed waddy and strikes his dusky
Juliet an amorous blow on the skull, and then
drags her away to the home his love has built for
her. The picture is indeed a moving one.

There is a story told in Melbourne n
which a well-known aged barrister and literary
man of rather pompous style, and The late Marou
Clarke are the heroes. It was when Marcus was
attached to the Anaus, 20 years ago, and had no
more spare cash than his even then venerable


she said slowly, “is perhaps too strong an ex-
pression, but oh ! Alfred, I will always be true to
you because your face reminds me so much of my

afterwards, but he doesn’t remind her of her dog
so much now as he used to do.

It is stated on good authority that the
Baroness Burdett-Coutts has got ahead of her
Gracious Majesty in a matter of etiquette which
concerns the undressed condition of the upper
half of the human frame. According to Court
regulations all ladies who attend the Queen’s draw-
ing-rooms must do so with their clothes hauled
down as if they were escaping out of them, and
those who don't care to exhibit a sere and yellow
back to the public are permitted to stay away.
The Baroness, however, objects to either alterna-
friend. One day Clarke invited the old man to
lunch—expecting it would ba a matter of half-a-
crown apiece. The ancient gentleman, however,
who had flitted round London when George IV.
was King, and liked to liv- np to dear old times
where er he got the chance ordered the most
delicate and expensive things in the menu, to
Marcus’s intense embarrassment, and when the
reckoning came, the little entertainment cost poor
Clarke a sovereign—par haps the last he possessed.
But the point of the joke is that later in the day
the stately old gentleman was bemoaning his want
of ample funds to a friend at Busohmann’s wine-
shop in Bourke-street and plaintively confessed,
“ Why, I'm even indebted for lunch to-day to that
boy, Clarke !”

An anonymous scientist announces in the
Age that if the girls go on studying as they do
the result will be universal feminine baldness.
The point of the thing is that the dear old babe of
a scientist doesn’t know that the dear girls are
pretty bald already. When a girl sends word
that she is indisposed and can’t coma to a party,'
it means, in nine cases out of ten, that she has
mislaid her hair, or else the cat has gone away
with it. Why, we remember once, years ago,
when we were shipwrecked, and by stupendous
exertions saved 17 young ladies from a watery
grave, 10 of them were bald, 'ihey hadn’t had
time to bring up their tresses when they rolled
out of their bunks and made for the deck, and the
odd one had her hair on sideways, so, as the posi-
tion seemed pretty desperate, we took it off her
and used it for lighting a fire. After that piease
don’t talk to us about hair.

Thellate Dr. Bunce, of Ballarat, was fond
< of-narrating a little experience he once had with
jia Bunga-ree savage. He was disturbed at mid-
night one i night in winter by the furious knocking
•of an excited clodhopper, who requested—nay,
demanded—the doctor's immediate attention to an
. urgent ( vqase at Warrenheip, an 11 miles’ drive.
(The.savage was so flabbergasted that the medico
, cojild not get an inkling of the trouble, but as this
happened.at a time in his career when a case was
a circumstance, the doctor mounted his chariot,
and followed in the wake of the spud-miner's go-
car. It was a dirty, dark night, and the medico's
emotions were the reverse of pleasureable when
he discovered that he had been enticed 11
miles, through wind and sleet, to prescribe for a
tow headed, freckled youngster of seven years, suf-
fering from a mild attack of measles. The savage
was reassured by the doctor’s Latin exclamations
and evident disgust, and, when the all-important
questionof fee was broached, he waxed cheeky, and
said he hadn’t a blanked cent in the house. A few
warm remarks ensued, and it ended in the doctor
mounting his trap and driving off, as mad as a
hen wnen hawks are around. The night
was so dark and drear, however, that, after run-
ning into fences, banging up against trees, and
splashing into bog-holes for half-an hour, Lr.
Bunce was constrained to return to the humble
cot of his patient for a guide. The savage
came out in answer to his call, and when the case
was stated swore an oath or two, and said he
could not he kept from his bed for every blanked
fool. “But,’’ said the doctor, “I can’t find my
way 1’ “ Well,” replied the savage, with the air
of a man who is making a sacrifice, “1 11 drive ve
outer th' metal-road for half-a-sov., moneydou-n"
He got the half-sov., and the doctor ne% r prose
cuted the acquaintance further.

Mr. Kenneth Mackay, some rhymes from
whom appear in this issue of Tub Bulletin, has
jus-, issued a little book entitled “Slirrup
Jingles,” which, as its name would indicate, deals
with such themes as Gordon loved to sing. The
book is, in fact, dedicated to Gordon’s memory in
some good verses, in which the author frankly
says :
" While if about my lines there may be clinging
Some shreds of fancy brighter than my own,
they have been caught through listening to your singing,
And have amidst my duller dreamings grown.
11 Still, as they are the best that I can proffer,
I place them o’er the dust from which they grew—
Well Knowing that in spite of foe and scoffer,
They would have found a kindly friend in you.”
And off the author canters in a lengthy and racy
defcrlption of a Randwick meet somewhat in the
” Dagonet vein, and follows this piece with a
number of fiery, dashing, strong-pulsed “ Bush
Sketches,” “Yarns by Old Stagers”-of which
the “Black Reckoning” recalls Farrell’s “ Ylr-
ginius”—and a number of short pieces. We are
sorry that Mr. Kenneth Mackay couldn’t give the
“ blarsted ” wattle a rest, and we are glad that
we do not know him personally, as we once, after
wringing the perspiration out of our brain—in-
duced by reading about the “wattle’s rare
bloom ’’—swore a deadly oath to slay the next
wattle poet that ever crossed our path. By the
way Mr. Mackay shows ia his li -tlo b:ok that he
has quite enough talent to go a lone hand. We
say this because “ The Stockman’s Offering,” has
an irritating way of suggesting other verses of
other authors. One caution more!—Writing with
a knife dipped in the congealed gore of a recently-
deceased poet, who came to his end by perpetrat-
ing a similar crime, we threaten to offer Mr.
Mack ay to the gods if he ever again rhymes

Here is a curious incident. Four gentle-

discovered that a valuable diamond had vanished
from the ring on his finger. All search was fruit-
less, and two of the party left just then to catch a
train. On the way, one of them being annoyed by
a stone, as ha thought, in his shoe, stooped to
remove it. Something peculiar in its touch
prompted him to examine it by the light of a
lamp, when the missing diamond so start’ed him
that he nearly dropped it. Hurrying back to the
cafo he surprised the other pair, still hunting
among cirks and cigar-butts, with his marvellous
story. How it got into his shoe, and how it was
that after it got there he did not eject it without
examination, a’ e questions we leave to the conun-
drum-answerers of the News,

Now, this is filling a long-felt want with-

that she is about to start a “school for wives.”
Girls who patronise the new academy will be in

washing, poultry raising, and baby-rearing, all of
which is good; but when the enterprising
academy runner adds that she will also teach her
pupils physiology, elocution, and debating, she
seems to be rather over doing the business, and
men will have a dark suspicion that her curri-
culum embraces curtain-lecturing, flat-iron throw-
ing, and broom-handle exercise, as well. How-
ever, she guarantees to supply “ a perfect wife

Editor Bulletin. —The S.M. Herald
published the other day an article entitled “ The
Country Parson in Australia,” but, possibly with
a view to limiting competition in the newspaper
profession, gave an altogether incorrect account
of that white-tied individual. The country parson
in Australia is an individual who comes to the
co onies with the idea of faving souls, but who
drifts into the Devil’s Brigade on the first oppor-
tunity, and assists in damning the population by
w riting for that infernal machine of Beelzebub - the
Press. The country parson in Australia is a myth.
He is a town man is the parson in Australia. He
edits dreary compilations of respectable twaddle,
lives in the shadow cast by the protruding eaves
of the daily newspaper offices, and he generally
manages to make enough money to get home to
England to be buried. Reguiescat in pace !
Yours, A Parson.

A S.M. Herald reporter who has been
doing ” the private bars of Sydney, observes
that he saw a customer kiss a Hebe and call her
“his little dear,” also that she seemed to like it,
and afterwards turned sideways to comb her
ruffled tresses. This isn’t much of an argument
in favour of the abolition of private bars. Why
the good Sunday-school boys and girls, from Pitt-
atreet chapel, whose parents read the Herald
and express themselves terribly shocked at such
hideous wickedness, have been known to do the
very same thing.

“ Old Saltbush ” has issued a volume
of poems, songs, and ballads under the generic
name of the “Death of Oswald.” The book is
tastefully printed and published by Turner and
Henderson, and the poetry is probably too good to
line boot-trunks with. Of it, otherwise, we can-
not say very much. The lines seem to read all
right, but they lack colour, point, and vigour,[and
the poet drones along in the same old monotone
whether he is singing of joy or of sorrow. Not
much of an enthusiast is “ Old Saltbush,” It is
all fhe same to him whether he drops a brick on
his corny” big toe or finds half-a-sovereign. On
the whole, we think the resignedly sorrowful
about predominates—by a neck, perhaps. The
tides of his poems are rather lugubrious, although
the poems themselves do not sustain the impres-
sion, or any impression at all save one of
sipping very thin milk through a very
small straw. Amongst other things, “ Old Salt-
bush chants “Oswald and Ellen: A Death
Scene,” “Despair,” “The Family Chain,”
Wreck of the Pride of the Yarra,” “ The Oath
»engeance,” “ Death of an Aboriginal,”
Drought,” “Death of G. R, Nichols,” “In
Memoriatn,” “ The Maniac’s Manuscript,” “Near
Midnight,” “Death of Leichhardt,” and an
Epitaph.” Sounds grim 1 “Old Saltbush"
must bo the poet of the shades—perhaps his name
is Charon. We strongly recommend the volume
for use at next annual picnic of the Sydney
undertakers.

Diamond cut diamond ” was the prin-
cipal item upon Sydney Water Police Court pro-
gramme on a recent Thursday, the leading
characters being taken by Thomas Foster, a dash'
mg, rollicking young buck of 50 years, and his
good wife Jane, a sweet girly-girly creature, aged
bO. Exac ly nine weeks ago Thomas led his fair
the hymeneal altar, and on a recent
Wednesday night a base minion of the law led
Thomas to the watchhouse, on a charge of desert-
ing the poor trusting wife who had timidly con-
sented to cast in her lot with his. Mr. Foster it
appears, is a pensioner in receipt of the princely
income of 6s. 3d. a week, and his version of the
case ran as follows : “I never saw this woman
till one night she came to where I stayed, and pro-
posed to marry me. I said, ‘Go away, woman ; I
can t marry you ; I have no money to keep you.’
She said, Never mind that; I have plenty money.
I have £ll 000, and will keep you like a prince'
never have to work.’ Then I said’
1 hats a good mark ; 111 have you.’” Mrs.
E oster gives a somewhat different account of how
the battle raged, however, for she swore : “I only
knew the gentleman two days before I married
him. I took a fancy to his photo., which I saw in
a triend s house.” (N.B. —Thomas is as homely-
lookiDg as a mud fence.) “ ‘ Will you marry me ? ’
eez ha : 1 will,’ sez I, and next night we were
married in the house. I was very foolish, but
there is no accounting for this kind of thing."
What a charming, romantic little story of sweet
maiden simplicity and pure virgin love is told in
those few artless words! The joy of the happy
pair was too great to last long, however, and at
ine end of three weeks’ time Thomas began to
get cnntrairy about money matters.” The
princely life he expected to enjoy seemed to be
about as far off as ever, and on pressing Mrs. F.
for a sight of the fourteen thou., she declared she
had no ready cash at all, but held papers relating
to certain castles in Spain in the shape of “ a
quarter of a million in Chancery.” Thomas at
once had these papers examined by a lawyer, and
then there was more trouble ; for, finding he had
about as much chance of getting hold of the
moon as of the Chanc: ry cash, he cut up rougher
than ever, and finally, as alleged, skipped from
his eight-weeks’ bride entirely. Desertionnot being
proved, the case was dismissed.

fixed in their false teeth securely, “ a horrid
whisper fell a-morgat them as they lay.” namely,
that the affair wouldn’t be “so select as usual,
my dear ; they thought it would be too much
selector and not select enough; they thought
there might be some people there who hadn’t oiled
their hair properly, and whose forefathers had
perhaps “come over” in the early days; they
themselves had come out in the Ark, and were
sitting here with the blacks when Cook landed, so
on the strength of that they stayed away from
the dance. The result was that the affair was a

It is rumoured that Sydney doctors fre-

also William Jones, of the same street, and the

Dear Bulletin, — Your tale about the old
nan who, requested to pay a guinea by a bazaar-
itall houri for a kissed cup, paid it and asked for
t clean cup to follow, has its complement on the
>ther side. My authority is that of an eye-
witness, Oscar Wilde, who, like myself, was
ifterwards to be lucky enough to mciude its
'harming subject in our circle of friends. It was
fa London during the first visit of the Comedie
Francaise. A fair was given at the Albert Hall,
and Sara Bernhardt had a stall. She was the
lion (or rather lioness) par excellence of the fete,
and her sales were taken at any price. Among
others a full-blown example of the wealthy English
cad approached and enquired the price of a pretty
little cup and saucer. Sara told him. Whereon
he said, in schoolboy French, 111 give J OI V f a lf
yen’ll kiss it first.” Sara, with a superb gesture
of disgust, flung the cup to the floor where it
smashed in pieees, and turned away to someone
else.—Yours &c., F.A.

Whenever you come across a paragraph in
a Sydney da 4 ly commencing with the well-known
words. “ An accident which might have been at-
tended,” you should give it best, drop it, and read
something else. It’s sure to end in asbght
shaking,” or, at best, “ a rather serious shock to
the system." It never comes to within a mile of
the coroner’s inquest that we all love so much.

There is a certain brilliant Melbourne
journalist, distinguished equally for his former
gallantries in the field of Mars and his present
gallantries in the drawing-rooms of the fashion-
able world. The other evening he dined at a
house in East Melbourne in the most jovial Of com-
pany, and was invited to stay for the night.
When proceeding to retire, Henry—we shall call
him—after bidding “good night” to his host, was
passing from the dining room to the stairs when
at the foot of the latter he came into collision
with a female figure. In his most courtly manner
Henry over and over again bowed and made his
apologies, but the fair one neither moved nor
spoke, and the host coming upon the scene, found
his guest apostrophising a red table-cover which a
servant had thrown across the bannisters.

Sandy Macblank is a “ squattah ” in Aus-
tralia Felix (we cannot afford to be deflnate till
libels cheapen). Mac is a red-headed and a level-
headed and a partially-baldheaded man; he
manages his own station, and owns numerous
town lots. He and his lady are always well
received when they take a spell in the metropolis.
Society knows very well that Macblank’s lady is
not altogether Mrs. Macblank, but Mrs. Mac-
somehodyelse. This does not trouble society,
though ; when society has occasion to draw atten-
tion to the fact, it whispers it behind a fan, with
stipulations that it shall “go no further, dear."
That’s Cbap. I. Chan. II.: One evening, in
March, after a regular “scorcher,” when the

p
THE TWO SECRETARIES (in chorus) : “WHAT A NOSE!”
and the bleating and lowing of Mac’s flocks and
herds sounded from beyond the clearing, a
tattered, benr, and dusty wayfarer, encumbered
by an unwholesome-looking bluey, clambered
through the slip-panels, and dragged his gaunt
person up to the storeroom. There he leisurely
unshipped his “ drum,” and seated himself upon
it before he deigned to give his order. “ Want to
sea th’ boss, old Mac hisself, no one shorter, he
taid. After much argument and profanity, Old
Mac" was called out. Then the footpad uprose,
obsequiously removed his time-worried tile, and
pleaded in a thin voice : “ Br y’ goin’ to do th
usual thing, boss—a pannikin o’ damper-dust an a
bit o’ tea ?” Mac was wroth at being disturbed for
such a poverty-stricken footpad, and told him
“no,” he’d see him burning first. The man
pleaded pertinaciously, but deferentially withal,
and at last the lordly squatter waxed properly
mad, and, cursing heavily, swore he’d bullock-
drive the beggar off his land if he didn t cut at
once. Then the sundowner changed his ( lay:
“ You won’t give me no flour ?” he queried. No,
I’ll be shot if I do.” “ You wont give me no tea
an’ no mutton?” “No; go, d n y°u I

The bridegroom experienced perils by sea ere route

A young Government clerk with a frugal
soul was carried out the other day in Wellington
(N.Z.) amid loud applause. He had been married
three months before, and had celebrated the occa-
sion by the purchase of a 25s. wedding cake for
24a. Possibly, however, the wife he got wasn’t
up to sample; perhaps married life in general
proved not the thing it was cracked up to be, or
mayhap the gas bill weighed on his mind, but, at
all events, he dropped in one evening and called
the baker a liar, and broke a window, and was
carried out twice under the baker's arm with his
head hanging down on one side and his legs on the
other, and was dropped down in the gutter and
got up again, screaming with rage in his efforts to
get a reduction of 4s. on that wedding-cake. Thus
is it painfully demonstrated how much of the
romance of life can vanish in three months.
The day a man is married he has a lordly contempt
for wealth, and would as soon come home in a
shilling cab with his feet sticking out of the win-
dow as take a cheap, vulgar omnibus, and yet in
three shore months he is ready to tear up the
whole street with his nails for four shillings. In
three months more, probably, he will sit round in
pyjamas all Sunday to save the wear and tear of
his go-to-meeting coat, and about six years hence
he will be a s jrdld wretch who Is ready to wallop
the rising family within an inch of their lives
when he finds three of them sitting at the same
time inside his hat. And yet they say that an
honest man is the noblest work of God, though
the house-cat is so much convinced to the con-
trary that she will start off up the chimney if he
only looks at her.
A Scribbler Stops to Think.

"It was all very well to get up and talk about literary
writing, but everyone who knew the late Marcus Clarke

Differences of opinion
are one of the safety valves of everyday life.
All interest in life would ceass if everybody
thought in the same groove. Even love would
die if his little quarrels were dealed him ; aid the
beautiful object of his affections, whose ambition
it is to become by turns his wife, cook, house,
keeper, washerweman, and nnrse, would soon fret
herself into fiddleitriugs if she failed to provoke
him into a breach of the verbal peace at least
twice in every week or tea days. Most of the
people we meet in the street hold very decided
views on all the principal topics of public interest.
Some are very disagreeable on the subject of the
Bulli Fund distribution, while others are equally
objectionable in the matter of the corporation
frauds; one man swears by Parkes and another by
Melville ; and one who belongs to and believes in
the Salvation Army is taking his 7-bell nip withja
man who is a rigid Sabbatarian one day in the
week, a fervent apostle of the greed oa the other
six, and wears a blue ribbon and a belltopper hat
all the time. Fortunately there is one common
ground on which all who meet can agree. No
sooner is reference made to Clausen’s New York
Champagne Lager Beer than they are una nimous
n their acknowledgments of the solid merit which
hasm ade that particular b rand so p op ular. Its spark
ing brilliant purity, and its invigorating tonic
properties are known to all; and i ; is impossible
for any sane man, no matter how angular may be
his proclivities, to maintain an adverse opinion on
the subject when his nose has once been surrounded
by the rim of a tumbler containing that modern
nectar known to fame as Clausen's Lager Beer.
Among the interesting additions to the litera-
ture of the day. however, is the report of the New
South Wales Drink Commission. It gives the
condensed opinions of so many people whose
opinions one is glad to get on a subject of mu eh
importance, and “Barmaids and Private Bars’,
have been pretty freely discussed therein, for the
benefit of the community, of course, by some who
are supposed to know all about them, as wall as
byothers whose sources of information are at the
same time a source of wonderment. The police
authorities and the m sgistrates, sundry publicans
and many parsons, representatives of local option
and apostles of temperance, cabman who should
know and clerics who shouldn’t, with numerous
other equally good and virtuous men, have had
their little say, and the result is another illustra-
tion of one of the proverbs of Solomon, that—
“D ffierent people basdifferent opinions—
Some likes apples and some likes inions ”
We live in a cold and a contradictory world, and
the topics on which all people can agree in
harmony and freedom are few and far between.
The most prominent one chat we can think of is
Clausen’s New York Champagne Lager Beer.
Everybody admits that it is the best in the market,
and everybody stamps the admission by asking
for it when the idea of a drink is suggested, or
whenever the sensation of thirst becomes oppnefs-
aive. It is a favorite in all bars whether public
or private, and it is just as refreshing to a local
optionist or an apostle, as it is to a police panjan-
drum or a prostrate invalid.

MORE FRAUDS!
Oar notice has been drawn to the fact that some
unprincipled person or persons are putting up a
very inferior article of Beer in the empty bottles
of the famous St. Louis Lager Beer, and palming
it off on the public as the genuine article. £5O
reward wi 1 be paid to anyone giving information
that will lead to the conviction of such person or
persons. One of our customers says he has seen
many of the bottles opened without the brand of
Anheuser on the corks, which is on all genuine
corks in the genuine bottles. The public should
examine each bottle before using it.

THE ’FRISCO SEALS.
We take the following interesting item from the
Newcastle (England) Weblky Chronicle of
August 6, 1887 “ The man who advertises any-
thing that is reasonably good, and advertises it
well is sure to succeed. According to the will of
Mr. Perrin, this manufacturer of Worcestershire
sauce has amassed a forimne of £700,000. The
secret of making the sauce is said to have been
brought from India by a Mrs. Gray, and Messrs. Lea
and Perrin, who secured the valuable recipe, lost
no opportunity of making themselves famous by
it. It is a fact that the most successful adver-
tisers are chemists. They discover a fairly good
marketable article, and if they have sufficient
capital to advertise, success is at once assured.
The principle of all advertising is first to get a
good thing and than let the public know you have
it. Our American friends far excel us in adver-
tising, for who bat a Yankee would have thought
of placing on the granite slopes of the Rooky
Mountains, on the giant trees of California, and
not only on the Seal Rocks opposite ’Frisco, but
upon the seals themselves, the words * St. Jabobs
Oil Conquers Pain 2 On the backs of some of the
seals can be distinctly seen the word ‘ Saint,’ on
others ‘ Jacobs,’ on others ‘ Pain,’ the whole die-
porting the mysterious legend, St. Jacobs Oil
Conquers Pain!

A Cairns (Q.) parson objects to three-

grumbling because they don’t get enough three-

Glen Innes gaol is just now tenantless.
The Bulletin suggests that it be fitted up to

The Nerang (Q.) Police Court sits once a
month and adjourns at 4 p.m. If the plaintiff
has finished his evidence by that time the court
doesn’t sit on. No. It adjourns ; and the de-
fendant, who knows the plaintiff’s case, has thirty
days to roll up fresh evidence and swamp the
other party.
A Queensland journal states that the
prisoners in St. Helena (Brisbane) prison “ mak-i
themselves generally useful in the sphere in
which Providence has placed them.” How mag-
nificently the writer of that unctuous phrase will
intone the responses when he himself gets into
the gaol choir!

last can have the other one by applying to me, as bare-face t

The brewers and wine merchants of Syd-

The oldest tree on record in Europe is
asserted to be the cypress of Somna, in Lombardy,

feet in height, and 20 feet in circumference one
foot from the ground. Napoleon when Haying
down his plan for the great road over the Simplon,
diverged from a straight line to avoid injuring
this tree.

”M. H. Davies, the new Victo-
rian Speaker, is 37 years old, having
been born at Geelong in 1860. He is
an evangelical lawyer who has coined
money in land-speculation, and is
married to the daughter of a Pres-
byterian parson. He is in a bour-
geois sense the ** best-looking
member of the Victorian Assenob’y,

stances is naturally enough President
of the Victorian Young Men’s alleged

*~ln his latest story, Mr. Robert
Buchanan describes a prison chap-
lain as “a pale, spare, clean-shaven
man, more resembling a priest of the
Roman Church than a Christian
clergyman.’’ This comes upon us with

Henry the Mormon first assumed the
title.* We won’t have it tfcat Her

The Marquis of Ailtabury,
who, according to cablegrams, has
been warned off the British turffor
life, for alleged swindling, is a young
fellow who is better known by his
former title, as Viscount Savernake.

f*Mr. Carl Feilberg, editor of
the Brisbane Courier, though out
of danger, is still very ill. Mr.
Feilberg landed years ago in Austra-
lia with a cavity in one lung, which
was permanently cured by a three
years’ sojourn on a Barcoo station.
After that he served his Journalistic
apprenticeship at Cooktown, then
tried his hand at editing one of the
South Queensland papers and con-
tributing to the Courier, before he
'turned up in Melbourne in the un-
congenial capacity of sub-editor of
the Arous. The Argus people have
frozen off the best employees they
ever had, and Mr. Feilberg gladly
embraced the offer of the Courier
editorship. He i eports that there
were only three men on the Argus
whose blood corpusc’es were red,
and, 10, one of these men in turn
departed, and is now in Sydney.
Mr. Feilberg has not many friends,
but they make up in intensity of
feeling for their number. He de-
clares the ideal journalist ought to
know everybody, and be known by no
one. What he is suffering from now
is asthma and general debility fol-

be remembered that a short time ago Mr.
H. B. Solomons, photographer, of this

Ithe Premier, Sir Henry Parkes, when he
visited Armidale. Mr. Solomons, at the
request of the Premier, forwarded the
{dtotos. to Sic Henry, and has received
the folldwing letter from the Premier,
which speak* for itself, and should prove
a moat -flattering souvenir :—“ Colonial
Secretary’s Office, Sept. 19th. Dear sir
On reaching the office this morning I found
your parcel with four photographs. I
thank you very much for this attention.
I have been photographed in the different
parts of tHfe world—not only in the cities
of Australia, but by different artists in
San Francisco andrNew York and in Lon-
don—and I think yours are the finest
portraits of me that I have ever seen by
photography, especially the one with the
arm* folded, and the one leaning on a
chair with pointed finger, both of which
appear to me beautiful photographic pic-
tures and true likenesses.—Yours faith-
fully, Henry Pakkes.” We have also
to thank Mr. H, B. Solomons for two of
the photos, of Sir Henry Parkes, one of
which can be' seen in our office. Both
portraits faithful likenesses, and
quite equal, if not superior, to anything
seen in the metropolis.

It is not safe to fool with a
Sydney metropolitan transit-officer
any more than it is to throw a sheep's
trot f er at a policeman —the man who
does either has cause to regret it.
About a fortnight ago one of these
officials approached a 'bus driver, and
said, sweetly : “ Jimmy, I want a
black and-tan terrier. Try and get mo
one. Mind, I don’t want you to shtale
it, but just bring the first one you
meet.” “ All right, sir," was the
answer, and for the ensuing week
the 'bus-driver kept his eye lifting
for the terrier, but without any suc-
cess. At the end of that time the
transit man pulled him up for over-'
crowding, and had him fined 205., and
next day he approached him again.
“ You know, Jimmy,” he said, “ I'd
sooner summons my own brother than
you “ Yes, I know, I know ;
but then you didn’t get that adjec-
tive dog.” They haven’t been friends
since.
For pure, whole-souled, self-
sacrificing magnanimity Melville,
M.P. and undertaker, is without a
peer in New South Wales. It may
be that he has learnt this virtue by
means of his long and intimate con-
nection with memoers of Parliament,
perhaps it is that he was vaccinated
for it. But he has got it, anyhow.
Of that fact he gave an avalanche of
proof last week. It was this way. He
was waiting till the truculent tram-
car came along, when an elderly
gentleman meditatively walked on to
the tramline, and calmly waited
there. In another sjcond the knock-
out between the meditative one and
the tramcar would have started. Bub
Melville was adjacent. Seizing the
prospective corpse with both hands,
the legislator pulled him out of the
track—pulled him from the narrow,
four-foot way which leadeth to the
grave when the trams are around,
and thus rescued him from the neces-
sity of acting prominently at an in-
quest. Melville saved a life, but ho
1-st a death. Not only lost a case -a
cherry-case —to the trade, thus post-
poning the long-desired boom in the
coffin industry, but actually cheated
himself out of a client. The corps©
would have been Ninny’s surer than
sin, for it is a queer kind of under-
taker who can’t secure a client who.
dies in sight of him that way.
Generosity so pure and rare as that,
on this occasion exhibited by Ninian
would be degraded by a dukedom.
The enterprising Union Steamship Co. of
New Zealand has decided to open a trade with
Norfolk Island in the hope that that hitherto
almost inaccessible dot of land may one day be-
come the sanatorium of the Australian colonies.
The little isle is situated only 900 miles from
Sydney. It is 18 miles in circumference, and
within that tiny space it embraces some of the
loveliest scenery known in the Pacific, and its
handful of inhabitants-some 700 in all—are a
primitive race who run a model Republic ot
their own far from the madding crowd, and
pass their own laws, subject to the approval
of the Governor of N.S.W. There are one or two
small stores, no hotels, no hospitals-none being
required, no liquor-the Chief Magistrate only
being allowed to dispense small quantities as
medicine at the order of the medical officer, no
gaol, and no miscellaneous curaednese, but there
are abundance of fishing, riding, dancing, picnics,
: tennis, and cricket, and a fellow's creditors don I
generally go there after him. Also, private ooard
with piano") is cheap and comfortable, ana
the accursed hash is unknown.
