Fiction
Irhomas Burke makes au astonishing
>ut in English literature. Limehouse
ghts: 2' ales of Chinatown (Grant
chards, pev Dymoek’s Liorary) definitely
ices Thomas Burke in the front rank of
tglish novelists. These remarkable short
n-ies present a new genius in literature.
English fiction there is no writer with
10m one can satisfactorily compare him.
i has the warm romance of Conrad ; but
is not of the Conrad school. He seems
stinctively to have acquired the brilliant
jhnique that made O. Henry famous; but
ere is not in his work that occasionally
■Rating feeling felt in O. Henry that the
>ry lias been cleverly constructed for its
expected climax. In Limehouse lights
e last paragraph is the logical completion
the story’s structural growth: after all,
e gorgeous blossom of poetry may have its
ots in manure. -Thomas. Burke has the
uminative realism of the ffcflTms Russian
velists; but he interprets that realism in
mis of poetry and splendor. Amid the
immest sordidness and cruelty and horror
the dregs of Limehouse he discovers the
umphant beauty of the human soul.
To a White Australian it. may seem re-
irkable that Thomas Burke has made lit-
ature out of such a subject as white girls
ring with Chinese. Most of hbs stories
M with this repellent fact, and are set
the opium houses of Limehouse’s China-
wn. Yet “The Chink and the Child” is
tale for tears, and should you hear it in
e lilied tongue of the yellow men, it would
vaken in you all your pity.” Lucy was
child of 12, whom Battling Burrows, a
igilist, horribly ill-treated. Cheng, a
tiinese sailor and a poet, met her in an
hum den. “She knew well what she had
be afraid of in that place; but she was
it afraid of Cheng.” He took her to his
10m, but merely to worship her white per-
ction. He decorated his room for his
imaculate goddess. Then Battling broke
1, took the protesting child away, and
hipped her to death. The final tragedy is
?yed in the highest tone of beauty and
athos. In another story there is humor,
his time the Chink was not immaculate.
1 his narration Thomas Burke permits him-
>lf the traditional row of dots that
> the hardened fiction-reader always means
ne thing; but the author disdains these
olite subterfuges. After his row of dots
e cheerfully continues: “When Marigold
Live herself to Tai Ling, as I have explained
' that row of dots ” And when Mari-
old was about to become a mother, to Tai
ling’s surprise there arose rivals, yellow
nd white, from all quarters of Limehouse,
1 claim the paternity. “There, then, Mari-
old lay in a comfortable bed,, comfortably
ttended, awaiting her time; while four men,
nly politely recognising each other’s exist-
nce, sat below and wrangled for the honor
f the fatherhood. Was ever a woman in so
bameful and so delicious a situation?”
Into the gruesome Thomas Burke plunges
dth Poe’s command of the shudder and the
brill. “The Paw” is a horrible story of
revenge, in wdiich a brutal father, whose
rife had cleared with a Chinaman, beats
Is child until he beats into her dazed mind
he necessity for her to murder that China-
nan. The long-continued horror of those
ratings is only partially redeemed, by the
loetic justice of the climax. And in “The
Jorilla and the Girl,” a sickening shudder,
n which a brutal father shuts up his
laughter in a room with a gorilla, the
lorror is dissolved in pathos.
Burke’s command of atmosphere is every-
where apparent. He makes us see Lime-
louse as if we lived there. Take this beauti-
:ul passage, which affords us a fine impres-
sion of Burke’s colorful style. “Against the
savage purple of the night rose a few wisps
if rigging and some gruff. funnels: lyrics
n steel and iron, their leaping lines as cor-
rect and ecstatic as a rimed verse. Under
the cold glare of the arclights, gangs of
(Asiatics hurried with that impassive swift-
ness which gives no impression of haste....
Hardly the place to which one would turn
as to the city of his dreams; yet there are
those who do. Hearts are broken in Black-
wall Gardens. The pity and terror and
wonder of first love burn in the blood and
limbs of those who serve behind the counters
of East India Dock or load up cargo-boats
at the landing-stages. Love-mad hands have
buried knives in little white bosoms in
Commercial-road, and songs are written by
the moon across many a happy garret-win-
dow in Cable-street.” And in another story
the author takes a well : known incident in
Lotidon, -where a houseful of desperate, well-
armed men held up the rest of England for
some days; and this is why he tells this
story. “It is an episode in the life and
death of Beryl Hermione Maud Chudder
and of Croucher Stumpley, and it is told
because it is beautiful and because the rest
of England arose in its fat, satin’d. Bays-
water wrath and called it beastly.” As
Burke tells it, the story has the high pathos
of the last act of Romeo and Juliet. In
contrast to this, “Gina of the Chinatown”
is one of the most delightful idylls of youth
and the music-hall. The descriptions of his
heroines are as beautiful as they themselves
must have been. They have not the beauty
that is classical and Greek; for Burke
rightly remarks of a visitor to Chinatown
that her beauty, being classical and Greek,
meant “that she was about as interesting
as a hard-boiled egg.” His heroines have
the wayward beauty of wistful youth and
passion ; though for most of them .“life was
just a dark house in a dark street.”
Thomas Burke will be worth watching.
When William J. Locke discards his im-
possible grotesques and determines to write
a simple story he can do it with a light and
truthful touch that is almost inimitable.
The Wonderful Year (Lane) is a charming
story of a meek young man and three maids.
The dismissed school-teacher is sent wander-
ing through France with a self-possessed
girl—a most unsentimental journey. But
the man, spending his last sou on his glori-
ous adventure, discovers his soul, though
he has to become a waiter and other things
in order to find mmself. Ultimately the war
happens along, but Locke differs from most
novelists by making his reader feel that the
war has not been introduced merely to
settle the affairs of his hero. The three
girls are delightfully characterised, and
Locke, wise old bird, knows how to keep
his reader guessing which will get the. hero.
The value of the nove 1 to the reader is the
intimate picture of provincial France and
the provincial French that Locke, in the
guise of fiction, so enthusiastically and
appreciatively paints. The Wonderful Year
is a fine product of the Entente.
J*
A. S. Neill, author of A Dominie's Log,
continues his engaging humor, shrewdness
and humanity in its sequel, A Dominie Dis-
missed (Jenkins, per Sydney Book Club,
and the publishers). So delightful a peda-
gogue as Neill was bound to be dismissed;
and it was only to be expected of so
original a personality that when ordered
by his doctor to recuperate his nerves by
vegetating in the country, he should take a
situation as a cattle-man with a farmer
in the village where he had been dominie.
The humors of the bairns are delicious, and
there is humor —or pathos—in the situation
of the dismissed teacher watching his suc-
cessor undo all that Neill fought for; but
Neill is serious beneath his fun. Educa-
tion, he says, aims frankly at turning out
highly efficient wage-slaves. “If the plans
of the Paris Economic Conference are car-
ried out true education is interned for a
century. Millions have lost their lives in
the military war: millions will lose their
souls in the trade war.... The first thing a
child should learn is to be a rebel. If a
man isn’t a rebel by the time he is 25, God
help him!” Neill has a pleasing theory
that the Calvinistic attitude to the public-
house is the chief cause of Scots’ drunken-
ness. “When a Scot enters a bar he knows
that he won’t have the courage to be seen
coming out again, and he very naturally
says to himself: ‘Ach, to hell! Aw’ll hae
another just to fortify mysel’ for gaein’
oot!’ ” Returning to education: “It is
more important for a boy to know some-
thing about feminine psychology than about
Henry the Eighth. He will one day be
called upon to choose a wife, but he’ll never
bo called on to choose a king... .Arithmetic
is the trump card of the man who wants
a utilitarian education. I can do lots of
sums.. ..1 could almost do a cube root. So
far as I can remember I have never had
occasion to use arithmetic for any purpose
other than adding up money or multiplying
a few figures by a few figures....l know
nothing about the process of law; I don’t
know what steps one takes to get married
or divorced or cremated or naturalised....
From a utilitarian point of view it is much
more important to know how to get married
than how to find the latitude and longitude
of Naples.”
Neill’s excellent theory is to allow a child
to learn what he wants to learn; and he
found some who wanted to learn arithmetic.
His ideal school would have no classes. His
teachers would merely act as guides to be
consulted when necessary, and they would
learn with their pupils. A teacher should
not be an encyclopaedia of facts; he should
be ab inquirer. When Neill’s successor con-
sults him about the allocation of prizes, and
wants to know if Dave was good at any-
thing, Neill replies: “Well, he holds the
record for spitting further than any boy in
the school; I think he deserves a prize 'for
that. Believe me, every boy in the class
would rather hold that record than carry off
the prize for arithmetic.” Even reading
penny-dreadfuls is education. Magistrates
trace all juvenile crime to penny dreadfuls
and the cinema. Penny-dreadfuls give a boy
a vocabulary and exercise his imagination.
Comparing the penny-dreadful with Dickens,
Neill remarks that the penny-dreadful goes
straight to the point. “Harold looked
straight into the blue barrel of a Colt auto-
matic.” Dickens would have given way to that
Victorian nuisance, circumlocution, like this:
“Harold contemplated with extreme appre-
hension the circular muzzle of a cerulean
blue automatic pistol of the kind specifically
manufactured by the celebrated world-famous
American firm of Colt.” “The romantic way
to look at crime is to fix your attention on
drink and penny-dreadfuls and cinema
shows; the realistic way is to look bravely
at the economic division of wealth that
causes poverty and disease, the father and
mother of crime.”
All through this text-book for teachers
runs the delightful love-story of Margaret.
The dismissed dominie falls in love with the
simple Margaret. '“Do you know that popu-
lar song, ‘You Made Me Love You’? That’s
the only popular song I ever struck that lias
any philosophy in it. ‘You made me love
you ; I didn’t want to do it’... . Margaret,
that’s the true story of love. I didn’t want
to love you; my mind kept telling me that
you were not the right woman. . . . and here
I sit in paradise because your head is on my
shoulder.”
The Navy
Henry Newbolt’s Tales of the Great War
i ijongmans. Green,, per Dymock’s Library)
are authentic .history, brilliantly written.
And as three of them deal with the Sydney-
Emden fight, with Von Spee’s two naval
actions in the Pacific, and with the Jutland
battle, the fact that Newbolt guarantees
them as accurate gives them a value even
greater than the author’s manner of telling
them. Newbolt states that he laid his
sketches before those who appear in his
stories. ‘'Two great Admirals, one great
General, and several junior officers, have
read my MS. and made corrections and addi-
tions of the utmost importance. I need
hardly tell you that, with such evidence at
my disposal, I have not invented one word
of the book. Even when I have ventured to
comment or praise I have followed the
opinions expressed by eyewitnesses.” He
apologises for not having given a bbok of
“Deeds of-Daring”; but he adds: “Is it
great moments that you want? Think then
of the moment when the Australian boys
began to feel the Emden’s shot; when
Sturdee sighted the Gneisenau; when
Beattie saw the Queen Mary sunk with all
her men; the lonely moment of the night
when Smitli-Dorrien decided to stand and
fight, against all odds and orders.” So
Newbolt wisely says that tne only way. to
tell these true tales is the plain way, “with-
out embroidery.” He leaves his reader to
put in the embroidery.
So with Sturdee editing Newbolt’s
proofs, we have the authentic stories of
Coronel and the .Falkland Islands. Newbolt
is sure that Craddock, who went down in a
fight that was hopeless from the outset,' was
not at all likely to have underestimated the
strength of his enemy. Craddock had asked
for reinforcements: the Admiralty merely
sent him the slow old Canopus. If Crad-
dock could catch the Germans before they
were reinforced by the Schamlwrst and the
Gneisenau, he was a match for their inferior
ships; if the enemy fleet junctioned and he
met them before the Canopus could come up,
he was sure to be defeated. Anyhow,
Craddock meant to tight. “He had asked
for reinforcements, and the Admiralty had
sent him what they thought sufficient. It
was not for him to hold back after that.”
Now t , Lord Fisher had come back to the
Admiralty the day before the defeat of
Coronel. He had no doubts about the man
to command the expedition he was sending
out. It was evident that if anyone was to
be criticised for the Coronel disaster it
would be those officers at the Admiralty
who had advised the sending of the old
Canopus to reinforce Craddock. The chief
of these was Admiral Sturdee. “Now, as
Admiral Sturdee might some day be held
partly responsiole for Craddock’s fate, it
was only reasonable that he should be given
the chance to ‘clean-up’ the situation him-
self.” So Sturdee went to his trial and
triumph. Fisher insisted on the immediate
departure of the Invincible and the In-
flexible, ready or not ready. If they had
waited the two days the dockyard officials
demanded, Von Spee would have reached
the Falklands' before they did, and there
would have been a different battle. The
secret of the departure was wonderfully well
kept, and the precautions taken on the
voyage, including a wireless message that
bluffed the Germans, were extraordinary.
As one of the German prisoners said, when
they approached the Falklands, the Germans
laughed “till their sides ached,” for all they
saw were some small British vessels and
the old Canopus on her mudbank. It looked
easy. But the next moment they “cried till
their eyes ached.” They had caught sight,
over the land, of the tripod masts of the
two Invincibles. Even then they thought
they were Japanese and not British —how
could British battle-cruisers have come
there?
Comparing Von Spee with Craddock,
Newbolt, after a brilliant account of the
fight, points out that each commander knew
his inferiority from the first. Craddock
determined to fight. Von Spee thought it
his duty to run. “But it is clear that run-
ning, whether it was his own policy or that
of his Service, was not only a losing game,
but the game of the losing side. You have
only to consider what it would have been
worth to Germany to have had a Craddock
flying his flag in the Scharnhorst on that
December 8. You can imagine him. when
the great battle-cruisers came out of harbor,
signalling (as Craddock did). ‘I am going
to attack enemy now,’ and going straight
to meet them at full speed. Their steam was
not yet up—he could have' closed them then
and there. What a fight that would have
been! No impotent scattering flight, with
ships turning vainly this way and that, to
bring their guns to bear upon an enemy
beyond their reach; but a desperate short-
range action with every shot telling—a
chance of dealing the enemy a heavy blow
before the end, and the certainty of leaving
a great tradition to the Service. Beyond all
doubt, that would have been Craddock's way
—the way of Coronel.”
Summing up the Emden fight, Newbolt
says: “The action was the first ever fought
by the new Australian Navy, and it is of
great importance to a new service that the
personnel of it should stamp themselves at
once as fighting men of the first class. This
the whole company of the Sydney did —in
less than two hours they had established a
tradition.”
New bolt writes a lucid account of the
intricate strategy of the naval victory of
Jutland; and points out that for a fresh
battle during the month of June Jellicoe
could have brought into action a fleet the
exact equivalent of his original fleet, minus
only four battle-cruisers. The Kaiser could
have sent out 14 battleships instead of 22,
no battle-cruisers, two armored cruisers and
perhaps 10 light cruisers—a force which
could with absolute certainty be destroyed
by two squadrons of our Battle Fleet and
their light cruisers. “The German Navy,
which on May 30 ranked second among the
navies of the world, on May 31 sank to
fifth place, leaving ours in a greater superio-
rity than before. A deadlier loss still is
the doubt cast upon the efficiency of their
gunnery. Its failure seems to have been
due to the worst of all causes, a defect not
of material but of personnel.” Under pun-
ishment our gunnery was just as efficient;
their efficiency became rapidly reduced.
As an eye-witness aptly observed :
“We shook the German Fleet to its heart;
they will neA T er be the same fleet again.”
Space does not permit anything but the
mere mention of the admirable narratives
of the sister Service. Indubitably the book
is one to be read and kept.
Jt
For -a complete and up-to-date account of
the inner life of the Royal Navy the reader
is cordially referred to Pincher Martin, 0.D.,
by “Taffrail” (Chambers; 3s. 6d.). O.D.
means ordinary seaman. The author takes
his typical bluejacket right through all his
training; explaining, in the guise of fiction,
everything about the Navy that the civilian
is likely to Avant to know. The latter half
of the book deals interestingly with Pincher’s
life in the war, first on a cruiser that Avas
torpedoed and then in a destroyer. Pincher’s
adventures on “The Day” are ably described;
and from this book one understands how
much that is dramatic lies behind those curt
Admiralty phrases that appear in its reports.
The author declares that bis incidents are
true, but they have necessarily been given a
fictitious coloring. He need not have
troubled: the incidents he describes so
accurately are quite obviously true.
d*
John Buchan’s account of The Battle of
Jutland (Nelson, 4d. here) is a concise
and lucid analysis of the most confused
naval scrap in history. Unfortunately he
furnishes only one plan of the battle, and
that is a rough and merely approximate
sketch. Even a brief essay like this should
be illustrated Avith a dozen diagrams. But
Buchan makes much of the strategy plain.
When Beatty, fighting against heavy odds,
determined to nurse his pursuers into the
arms of Jellicoe, though technically he Avas
the pursued his superior speed made him
the pursuer. “Once the northerly course
had been entered upon the enemy could not
change direction, except in a very gradual
curve, without exposing himself to enfilading
fire from the British cruisers at the head
of the line.” To the layman, one of the
unexplained things about this _ battle is the
escape of the German fleet in the night.
“The whole British Fleet lay between the
enemy and his home ports. It was a stra-
tegic situation which, but for the fog and
the coming of night, would have meant his
complete destruction.” But Jellicoe could
not risk his fleet in the darkness in a sea
swarming with torpedo craft and sub-
marines; though, of course, the battle, went
on during the night, waged by the lighter
craft. Yet they failed to keep touch.
Buchan mentions a fleeting glance one of
our ships had of “some of the enemy battle-
ships slipping past the British stern in the
fog and darkness.” And at dawn the enemy
had disappeared. A large amount of him
had disappeared to the bottom; but of the
remainder, “partly he had slipped in single
ships astern of our fleet during the night;
partly he was then engaged in moving home-
wards like a flight of wild duck that had
been scattered by shot.” Without any sug-
gestion of criticism or any knoAvledge of
naval tactics, this page Avonders what would
have happened if Jellicoe had risked break-
ing up his formation and ordered each of
his ships to choose her nearest antagonist
and stick to her till she sank her. However,
the results are satisfactory enough. As
Buchan says, “Germany was overjoyed at
having escaped annihilation, and the magni-
tude of her jubilation may be taken as the
measure of her fears.”

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort and good
health artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared fov emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

How About Your Overhead?
Let us tor a moment think of "overhead” as being the roof
above our heads. No building is better than its roof. Your architect
will confirm this statement. He knows that the factor of permanence is de-
cided largely m the roof. A leak in the roof means a leak in maintenance.
Certain-teed Roofing
is weather-proof and water-tight. It is unaffected by changes of temper-
ature or by atmospheric gases Not will it buckle, blister, crack nor creep.

do so easily and also

TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harm-
less, vegetable remedy that will make the
user of tobacco in any fopm absolutely aban-

Love, the Fowler.
Cease your wild singing, O unrestful bird,
Fluttering your frightened pinions in my
heart,
As though you felt the fowler’s closing
hand,
And in anticipation said farewell
To all the daisied meads, the yellow
streams—■
From which the noon sun steals the cloudy
blues
To make a mirror for his radiant face —
Fringed with the summer faintness of the
fern !
Cease your wild trembling, O prophetic
bird !
Across the street I hear a wooden blind
Stir in the breeze against a. balcony,
As though it knew the fingers of the wind.
Stretched forth from river gardens cool and
wet,
Felt ’midst the slats, that once were living
part
Of some pine forest, for vain memories
Of other winds that woke long since and
trod
The hidden perfumes from pale violets.
Flames by the domed grey House of Parlia-
ment—
The clustering poinsianas, where the red
Of blossom is a magic carpet laid
Across the crest of those close-kissing leaves,
And, pearl and silver, springs another day
A shimmering searchlight from the under-
world. '
A sparrow, commonplace and pert and
brown,
Housewife of some vined eave or shrubby
nest,
Twitters as though to rival my wild bird.
Till that sad singing shames its cheeping
dumb.
And yet to-morrow this smug speckled elf
Will have its way, maybe, of roof and tile
And burgeoning -tree and shadowy caves of
grass.
While mv wild bird who drearped an eagle’s
flight v
May lie a bunch of feathers on the floor
Of some cramped cage that makes sarco-
phagus,
Or. with its soaring voice forever still.
Peck slavishly the grain the Fowler gives!

M. FORREST.
A Song of Gladness.
I glimpse the plume of joy and catch the
beat
Of woodland music piped for fairy feet.
Blue sea, green trees, and butterflies at play
Quiver with laughter in the golden day.
Cleaving the air a little brown bird flings
Backward to earth the thrill of mounting
wings.
And Summer goes her way with white-limbed
grace,
Dropping a flower in every desert place.
Radiant my theme. A minor note of woe

Youth and Age.
Youth, the prospector, goes.
Searching the wide world o’er;
Lust in his bright eye glows;
Eager, from shore to shore,
Seeking what youth can find ;
Leaving the dross behind.
Only the best of gold
His high soul satisfies.
New dreams and manifold
See, still, his questing eyes
Down young adventure’s track ;
Never his feet turn back.
Ever his restless mind
Matches his onward stride;
Seeking some newer find
In vale or mountain side
Youth, the prospector, goes;
Patience but small he knows.
Age with a wearied limb
Treads back the path he came.
There is some gold for him
In each abandoned claim ;
Grains left, in very truth,
In the old dust of youth.
Where, with impatience, passed
Youth, with his heart a-spring.
There, his fire quenched at last.
Age does his fossicking.

THE BILL.
How is the wav going to be paid for? The
probability is that no one on earth knows.
The figures have already swollen to such
a siz3 that the human mind cannot grasp
the significance of them; and the fight is
still raging furiously. But the problem is
weighing heavily on every combatant
country. Whatever the result of the
struggle may be in a military sense, the
fighting nations are going to wake up to the
realisation of a holocaust in which millions
of lives have been broken, industrial sys-
tems turned upside down and inside out,
and obligations created which can no more
be met by following the old lines than by
merely walking about on bare feet.
* * * *
In England there are people thinking
about this —and thinking hard. One of the
results has'been the formation of an Empire
Resources Development Committee, and from
it last week there emerged a statement
“advocating the conservation of the natural
resources which are under the ownership
or control of the Imperial, Dominion and
Indian Governments.”
The development of this great and varied wealth
for State purposes under State’ auspices would lift
from the peoples of the Empire the burdens due to
the war. The national debt after the war will pro-
bably amount to £4,000,000,000, and the Govern-
ment will need an income of £500,000,000. The
committee’s scheme would enable the Empire to pay
the interest and also to secure unearned increment
out of which the whole of the national debt could
ultimately be paid. The State should assist in
providing such public facilities as electric power,
and thus cheapen the cost.
It is obviously impossible to criticise a
statement so general in its terms as this.
'To find fault with it, as one of the Sydney
newspapers did, on the ground that it
merely consists of a recommendation to
“extend the Government stroke” and lose
money is futile. What is the alternative to
great' measures of organisation and conser-
vation? By what other means than by
diverting the national riches .to the State
under conditions which protect the peoples
from exploitation can even the fringe of
the war-charges be grappled with? In the
vear before the war Britain carried a
national debt of £661,473,765 on which the
annual charge amounted to £24,500,000. A
revenue of £195,825,000 was enough. Those
days have gone and the talk is of a debt ot
£4,000.000,000, and a yearly revenue almost
as great as the value of all the exports sold
by the United Kingdom. To-day the taxa-
tion in Britain is' stupendous. To carry it
to the point of meeting a charge on a debt
of £4.000,000,000 in addition to the ordinary
cost of government (even if this were cut
to the bone) will surely be to
an immense impetus to the commerce ot
neutral countries free from such exactions..
To make matters worse, the earning power
of the country has been greatly reduced.
Many millions of income came from
foreign investments. The bulk of these
have been made valueless by the war or
the securities have been purchased by the
Government and converted into permanent
debt. Trade openings have been seized by
competitors, and it is safe to say that the
earning power of every countrv engaged in
the war has undergone tremendous shrink-
age. When the war stops and the people
turn to pick up the threads of industry
again—to live on earnings instead of bor-
rowings and repay what they had been sub-
sisting on in the meantime —they will do
so under conditions in which the disordered
old “muddle through somehow” would pro-
voke bankruptcy.
* * * *
To Australia this question of how the
nation’s war-created burden shall be carried
is no less important than it is to Britain
and France and Germany. By the middle of
the year the indebtedness of the States and
the Commonwealth will be in the vicinity of
£500,000,000 —almost on a level with the
pre-war debt of Britain and twice the size
of the Imperial funded and unfunded debt of
Germany prior to Armageddon. What is
going to be done? The brutal fact is that
the necessity of coming to some conclusion
on the subject is only being avoided by the
borrowing trick —by plunging deeper and
deeper into the quagmire. It is a mournful
truth that in this country not five minutes’
serious consideration has yet been given to
the crumbling foundations of our economic
being. If we escape disaster it will be by
the help of others, not in consequence of
anything, that may be done to avoid it by the
reckless pigmies who infest our public life.
This debt on Australia’s shoulders is .an
appalling reality. To imagine that we can
go on increasing it is madness. Australia
will directly be faced with the stern, naked
facts of existence, and it seems as if not
until the shock strikes her will the problem
of what we are going to do about it have
any consideration. Our Parliaments are
playing at war and playing at peace. It
may be that the Australian democracy is
incapable of handling that large measure of
State Socialism which alone seems to this
association in England to offer a way of
escape there from the consequences of war.
Certainly such experiments as have been
made with the animal hitherto are lament-
ably different from the kind of Socialism that
might keep the country from ruin. But that
State Socialism has been prostituted by
party wire-pullers and political loan-mong-
ers, and converted into a sort of disorgan-
ised charity, is no reason for believing that
these calamitous happenings are the last
words on the subject. If they are, the ex-
periences of the Commonwealth are most
certainly going to be variegated and numer-
ous. The population includes many thou-
sands of people who have spent a lot of
valuable time mouthing about their admira-
tion for public enterprise and Socialism, and
all the rest of it. This paper would like to
remind them now that the time is closing in
when something more than talk is wanted —•
when all the public enterprise and personal
industry that the people are capable of
will be in urgent demand. If they fail, Aus-
tralia will be drawn into entanglements from
which escape will be impossible. Have the
political parties any ideas on the subject, or
are they waiting to try to borrow them, too?
ON THE FOLLY OF TRYING TO
WEAR THE WRONG CLOTHES.
W. M. Hughes has been yelling with the
vigor that once charmed the duchesses that
Australia must arise and put on the toga
of nationhood; and his fine classic reference
opens up whole worlds of thought. The
toga, as worn by select and patrician Home,
was about the most astonishing garment any
section of mankind ever attempted to
stagger into. Somewhere about the age of
16 the boy who had the hard luck to belong
to the aristocracy of the Eternal City put
off the garb of childhood and assumed the
amazing tangles, creases and folds of the
toga of manhood. The Prime Minister’s idea
appears to be that Australia is now of the
right age to be swathed up in an affair of
a similar kind —a garment of infinite dignity
in which it is possible to talk, but almost
impossible to work. The toga varied a lot
at different periods, but in its sternest form
it was an enormous semi-circle of woollen
cloth, Without arm-hole or leg-hole or any
set place for the neck, which was hung
about the patrician by expert slaves, and
only stayed in its place by dint of
acrobatic' stateliness on the part of the
wearer. To call upon Australia to get into
a thing like that would, on the face of it,
a ppear to be a kind of freak lunacy; but
it is a lunacy quite common to statesmen,
kings and political writers. The toga is, in
their minds, the emblem of nationhood ; the
ideal of Imperial Rome is always in their
eyes; and the make and shape of men is
entirely forgotten in the game of statecraft
as it is unscientifically played. The Roman
Empire in its world sweep was the best
ordered, most dignified and. in a general
way, least troublesome organisation of man-
kind ever known; therefore a nation to be
any good must be something like it. It is
an idea that has held for a thousand years
or more and still grips. Even statesmen
whose knowledge of history is as vague as
their hold on the Ten Commandments have
got the notion in a crude way and endeavor
to put it into practice. The nation must get
inside the toga somehow with all its restric-
tions and its scheduled and ordered creases
or things can’t go right.
The attempted application of the idea is
at the root of most national failures. Ihe
make and shape of manhood varies and the
shape of nationhood must vary to fit its
manhood. The Greek tunic —even if it did
run to ballet skirts —was all right in its
place; so were the Celtic trousers; so was
the toga that made the Forum pure merino.
But the garments were not interchangeable.
Athens could n ver have been Rome, nor
could Rome ever have laid aside its dignity
and risen to th 2 frivolous mental exaltation
of Athens. Examine the history of the
English progi iss towards nationhood in the
light of Rom.Ji method and thought. Rome
early caught the idea that every citizen
owed a du y to every other citizen and
must support him in peace and war. The
natural outcome of that idea was a road by
which to reach the other citizen. Roads
and Romt were forever linked together. How
did that idea affect the development of Eng-
land? The Anglo-Saxon came to a country
where fine, straight, paved roads ran in
every direction; but their straightness and
utility merely annoyed him. He made no
effort to keep them in order; and in the
course of a century or two they were
covered so deep in mud and dead vegetation
and forgotten cats that their very course
was unknown. Thereafter the rising Eng-
lish nation drove its carts along twisted lanes
of rut and bog, and lost time and sweat and
horses in the process. It lost more than
that. Village communities that were part
and parcel of the nation and one with it in
all vital interests were allowed to die of
famine during years of plenty because there
were no roads by which they could be
reached. Yet the English mind saw no
more need for reviving the old Roman system
than do the minds of the Sydney suburban
aldermen in charge of the goat tracks of
Mosman and Cremorne. For a thousand
years England, as a nation, made no attempt
to construct a country thoroughfare of other
material than dust or mud ; and when John
Loudon McAdam, after proving in Ireland
that the thing could be done, brought a
satisfactory road-making system to the land
of ruts and bog-holes, he had a big job to
convince Englishmen that there was any
need for the thing. Yet roads, in the Roman
view, were important creases in the toga of
nationhood; and their straightness was not
merely a matter of fashion but something
of almost religious importance. England
couldn’t wear, a toga like that, though, even
in her roadless condition, she had already
climbed ahead of the best Roman effort at
some points. The fact was she had largely
adopted Celtic trousers —individualistic gar-
ments allowing separate action to each limb.
The Roman model was not for her; and
anybody who fancies that a suit of clothes
wliich proved too restricted for Britain would
sit nicely on Australian hips and shoulders
has still a number of things to learn.
* * * *
It is quite true that Australia at the
present moment has a curious political like-
ness to the Roman republic about the time
it cracked up and became a,n empire.
Marcus Antonius Hughes has a super-
ficial resemblance to the other person who
lost his heart at sight of an eastern queen,
much as he himself lost his head at the
smile of the English duchesses. Lepidus
Cook still believes he has a say in the triple
division of leadership; and Octavian
Tudor fences deftly and plans for the
empire which he feels sure will slip into
his hands. It is not so much that the men
themselves and the parties are like those
in the Roman struggle, but that the Aus-
tralian democracy is standing at gaze much
as the democracy of Italy did, and watching
its own power being stolen away by the
contestants. For all that, the toga is not
the sort of garment Australia can wear.
Hughes’s yell to us to get the nicely-creased
and folded thing over our shoulders makes
no real appeal. We do not understand
nationhood presented to us in his terms; and
it is tolerably evident that we never shall
understand it. What we do understand is
that the free people of Australia are getting
a bad deal at the hands of small politicians
whose desire to cling to office outweighs all
their regard for the public good. What we
understand, too, is that under pretence
of prosecuting our share of the war
effectively those small politicians have kept
us so much in the dark in matters vital to
Australia that our democracy has become , a
mere farce. And, over and above all this,
we have firmly grasped the truth that our
share of the war has not been prosecuted
efficiently, but that shameful muddle has
marked the from the start.
Of what use is it to us to bleat about putting
on the ancient and amazing Roman toga?
What we need at this juncture is the strong
man who will arise and say in the plainest
of plain Australian : “Lace your boots! The
small politicians are standing between you
and the Kaiser, and the time has come to
kick !”
THE IMPORTATION OF YANKS TO
CATCH BEETLES.
This paper knows nothing about Illing-
worth, an entomologist who is to be paid
£lOOO a year by the Federal and Banana-
land Governments for taking charge of an
entomological bureau at Cairns, except that
he is an American. But it does know that
the circumstances of his appointment are a
disgrace to both Governments. The facts
are that when the Federal Government was
carrying on the negotiations with Bananaland
which ended in the sugar crop of 1916 being
commandeered. Hughes, hearing about the
damage caused by the cane-beetle, offered to
subsidise the State if it would extend its
efforts to get rid of the pest. In order to
provide further funds the growers agreed
to contribute 3d. per ton on the cane
produced. Being thus armed with additional
cash to get rid of, the Bananaland Ministry
decided that the first step taken should be
to make an importation, acting apparently
upon the principle that no Australian scien-
tist is worth considering for. a job carrying
wages in excess of those paid to a laborer.
All this has been done at a time when the
atmosphere has been full of windy talk
about “giving encouragement to science in
Australia” and establishing a Federal Coun-
cil of Science and Industry, and after
degrees in science, equal in value to any in
the world, have for years been conferred by
Australian universities. Whoever may be
directly responsible for carrying to its logical
conclusion the policy, distinctive of Aus-
tralia, of starving scientific research and
bemoaning the absence of scientific effort in
industry, is maintaining his anonymity,
though Lennon, the Bananaland Minister
for Agriculture, seems to have had the
administrative handling of the business. But
neither of the Ministries concerned can
escape collective censure for this contemptu-
ous treatment of Australians. Not only is
an American surreptitiously appointed to a
position from which Australians were barred,
but Lennon has been unctuously talking
about his “hope that Illingworth would
bring with him several promising students
who might later on prove of considerable
assistance,” and condescendingly observing
that “facilities would be given to local
youths who wished to study entomology.”
Are there no promising students in Australia
already? No well-eauipped scientific
workers? No local youths already anxious
to specialise ■ in zoology, and with oppor-
tunity to do so under masters of equal
calibre to Illingworth ? This appointment
is a slap in the face for every Australian
scientist and student, and another illustra-
tion of the promptitude with which the
mostly-imported politician can be relied upon
to bang the door against the native-born.
On the sugar plantations at Hawaii
where Illingworth has been working,
some successful results have followed from
experiments in parasitology—and many
negative results. Enormous sums of money
have been expended in research and in print-
ing copious reports. But there is no reason
to suppose that a man from Hawaii will
solve the problem of how to establish a per-
manent moratorium for cane-beetles in
Bananaland any more readily than one
drawn from Australia —or even one acquired
through the Imperial Bureau of Entomology
in London. What there is reason to believe
is that if Australian Governments could
bring themselves to adopt a less niggardly
attitude towards scientific work carried on
by Australians, even the political mind would
find proof that there is ample material
within the Commonwealth to make importa-
tions unnecessary. Private undertakings
have many times discovered this, and scien-
tific men have learned from bitter
experience that the most . close-fisted,
unimaginative patron of science in the Com-
monwealth is a Government. The whole
public policy of the country is a warning to
every young man against making scientific
study his life’s work, or, if he does, to pro-
ceed somewhere else and do it. In that case
he might some day hear of an Australian
Ministry being about to make a decent sort
of appointment, and at least have a chance
of applying for it. The last beetle “expert”
imported from America remained four years
and produced a report of four pages! Then
he returned to the States with his knowledge.
When an entomologist was appointed, in
Papua a year ago the first that Australians
heard about the matter was from English
newspapers. This importing disease is get-
ting: into the nation’s bones.
* * * *
The blunder of the Federal Government in
this business is inexcusable. It should be a
formula in a case involving Commonwealth
expenditure for professional service that no
money would be forthcoming to meet. the
appointment of an outsider unless the Minis-
try was satisfied that there was no Aus-
tralian capable of taking the job. If a
carpenter was imported from Chicago to
build a monkey-cage or something there
would be a yell loud enough to scare the in-
habitants of Mars. The cane-beetle problem
is upon the same plane. It comes within
the ordinary scope of entomology, like dozens
of other problems relating to insect life; and
if Australia is going to deny the competence
of the men trained in her schools and labora-
tories to apply their knowledge and skill to
Australian problems and test their patience
and initiative in research, what possible hope
can there be for the future of science 111 the
Commonwealth? Would it not mean that
all the facile speech-making of the hour and
the scholarships at universities and all the
rest of it were parts of an elaborate sham.
Whether the Yank and his “promising
students” emerge victorious from then
struggle with the Cairns beetle is not the
test of whether their appointment is wise or
foolish. Science is not business. Ihe
Yankees may fail and yet be most earnest
and capable specialists in their particular
field. The point of the thing is that the
selection of a man outside Australia is
poisonous in its very nature. Instead ot
there being this- malignant differentiation
against Australian scientists there should be
readiness to utilise their talent, and pride m
having them on the premises. Science knows
no boundary of race or country, but it can
get no footing in a land which treats its
scientific workers as aliens. And so far as
The Bulletin is aware, there is no place
on earth where this has been done so system-
atically as in Australia.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Fury of Despair.
The British calm in the face of the new
German policy of super-frightfulness is not
hard to understand. The first outburst o
submarining was effectively stopped by tne
British navy. Germany countered by buiia-
ing larger underwater craft and going a ,.
again. The result has been pretty bad 5
the naval authorities have assured us that
- this also will be stopped. It is at the yer
hour when such stoppage is about due that
the Teuton announces to the world ms into
tion of playing the mad dog. Brl J ai °
answer is practically to the effect that
was playing it anyhow, and that a mue
more or less foaming doesn t alt
balance of things to the extent of four P^ e ‘
We can only guess what the German m
may be in officially and with all due s . g
effects proclaiming that the I\a iser s seamen
will henceforth go blindly raging acio ,
seas with no consideration for friend :
It is either a vital turn in the comedy o


Despair or a confident move on the part of
over-reaching ambition still bombastically
playing the tragedy of Victory. If the
latter, it means that Germany is so sure of
winning that she wants to bring all the
world into the fight to heighten the glory of
her success; if the former, it means that she
is so fearful of speedy and crushing defeat
that she will risk any crime or enormity on
the bare chance of turning the tide. All
through the war there has been a lot of bad
guessing on both sides; but the evidence at
present does not point to German confidence.
A great moral question is, however, involved
in the new Teuton departure from even its
former pretence of virtue. Already it has
been shown that Germany has no respect
for treaties; now it is being proved that she
has no regard for those fundamental and
unwritten principles of humanity which
alone have made civilisation possible. Can
a people with such views be safely allowed
to exist as a nation? It is a grave problem.
Kindly white men, with no feeling other
than that of pity, were compelled to delib-
erately exterminate the Apache Indians of
America because they were ruthless mur-
derers who could neither keep faith nor
understand mercy. No one wants to exter-
minate Germans as individuals; but the wis-
dom of ever making peace with a nation
capable of the suoer-frightfulness now out-
lined is very problematical. Possibly it is
a good thing that the Teuton has decided to
do his worst. It will enable some future
peace conference to understand the thing it
has to deal with : and even the British cocoa
conscience will hardly have qualms about
putting some restriction on the wild beast
that dripped innocent blood from all its
claws.
Territorial Spoils.
The statement of a British Cabinet Min-
ister that the colonies taken by force from
the Germans will not be restored is the
brightest ray of light shed on the war situa-
tion _ for a very long time. On their view
of his measure, it is now evident that they
have come to the conclusion that they can
lick him sufficiently to dictate terms of
peace. That is the only thing Walter
Long’s declaration can mean. As far as
the German colonies are concerned, none of
them are colonies in the sense that they are
populated by Germans and filled with Ger-
man homes; and as they merely represent
so much territory to exploit, it is fitting
enough that they should be part of the fine
inflicted on-tlie Teuton for his international
crimes. At the same time their possession
by Britain must enormously increase the
burden of nigger which that country already
carries; and the prospect of the future load
might stagger the broadest-shouldered nation.
Maoriland’s Prime Minister has already
stated his intention of hanging on to Samoa ;
but, then, Maoriland likes the control of
brown brother and makes the business a
comparative success. It is the territory
seized by Australia that fills us with the
greatest misgiving. The Australian ideal
has been a Commonwealth—not an empire.
Our problems are big enough on this con-
tinent without adding to them; and terri-
torial extension, with three-fourths of our
own area undeveloped, looks like merely
adding to the height of our difficulties. At
the same time, unless Britain took those
territories over from us, they might fall
into the possession of any one of half-a-
dozen Powers which at some far future date
might make strategic use of them for attack
on Australia. We seem to be somewhere
between the Devil and the vasty deep on
the question. Must we waste our small
national strength forever hanging on to
country which we cannot effectively occupy
for the sake of other country which we
might develop only for that waste of
strength? The fact is, Providence put far
too many islands in the Pacific.

The Waste in the Defence Department.
It is admitted now by the Department
itself that, in addition to the £66,000 which
one man, it says, has succeeded in embez-
zling. a very large sum has been stolen from
the Naval side. Even if the persons thus
far charged with the crimes are not guilty,
enough has been disclosed to indicate tlie
awful chaos of the Pay Office. The confu-
sion and muddle there are indeed absolutely
indescribable. And that has been its condi-
tion throughout. Right back in the days
when The Bulletin was still muzzled,
proof, came to it that, because the pay-
sheet of a camp had been rendered in dupli-
cate, some at any rate of the men had
been paid twice. It had proof that the
pay of one portion of the service had been
collected by an entirely different portion,
and that the first lot was left without money
• —some of the men actually stranded. But
while the chaos in the Pay Office has pro-
bably been worse than it is anywhere else,
the whole Defence organisation, so far as it
relates to the handling of money, has long
been a scandal shrieking for inquiry. On
the Works side hundreds of thousands of
pounds have been as utterly wasted as if
the money had been thrown into the sea.
Take the Warren, for instance, for some
time past the Artillery camp in N. S.
Wales, but now handed back to its private
owners. Thousands of pounds have been
spent there, on this private property,* rented
only from week to week—spent on buildings
and fences, etc., and at the very moment
when one lot of officers were arranging to
leave it another lot were considering a
scheme, which had practically been decided
upon, to spend nearly a thousand pounds
upon drainage. It is almost impossible to
dig anywhere into the operations of this
Department without discovering appalling
waste. The Pay Office is awful; the Works
side almost as shocking. But the tragedy
does not end there. Tens if not hundreds
of thousands of pounds’ worth of thoroughly
good equipment has been sent to the garbage-
tip and the destructor because there was
no formal authority to send it to a cleaner.
Australia has a right to have these things
inquired into. It must pay the bill pre-
sently ; and the longer the awful waste con-
tinues the more handicapped we shall be
in lighting this war to a finish. There are
two men at least from whom the country
is entitled to have a full and frank state-
ment of their experiences. Brig.-Generals
Ramaciotti and Williams will leave their
commands in N. S. Wales and Victoria next
week. Both are citizen soldiers; both are
business men. Both have been for 12 months
inside the awful machine. They have been
Australia’s servants there, and Australia is
entitled to know from them what that
machine is like. They will not. of course,
tell Australia unless they are placed under
formal compulsion to do so. Their patriot-
ism can then he relied upon to do the
rest. A commission ought to be appointed
to hear the truth from these two officers
and from anybody else who knows any-
thing about the management or misman-
agement of the Department. The in-
quiry should be confined to the business
administration for the present. On the
military side there have been scandals, too;
but they must wait. If Pearce is not
afraid of what an inquiry can produce, he
will welcome it. If be blocks it, or fails to
authorise it, then the Senate should be heard
from.

Poor Old Ma in a Spider’s Web.
There are nine-and-ninety ways of railing
the wind, and the Holman Government is
learning and practising them all. With the
sublime assurance of the confidence man
Holman confesses, almost boasts, how, in
the battle of wits, the Norton Griffiths
syndicate was beaten :—•
During the first two years of the contract’s cur-
rency it was agreed that £6,000,000 should be
raised, and also that the same sum should be spent
with the firm upon public works. The advantage
which the Government got was the guarantee of
this financial group that the money should be forth-
coming. This has been done. The guarantee has
been carried out. The £6,000,000 has been obtained.
On the other hand, the Government, instead of
carrying out its obligations to the firm, and giving
it £6,000,000 worth of work to do, has given it
only a very much smaller sum’s worth.
So the Government has collared some of
the money which Norton Griffiths raised
in London and has used it for odl jobs with
which the syndicate has had nothing to do.
But, though that may have been smart, it
merely postpones the evil day ; for it throws
upon the Government the obligation of finding
an equal sum of money outside Norton Grif-
fiths in the future. No matter what hap-
pens now, no matter what the future may
hold, the Government has thus put itself in
this position: it must make good the money
which it has—well, we will call it diverted —
or pay the syndicate compensation. If it
was in the toils before, the State has been
thus put still deeper into the mesh. It said
originally to Norton Griffiths : “If you
can succeed in borrowing £10,000,000 for us
you shall have the spending of it.” Now
it says: “i\o matter what we have to pay
for the money, we will get you £10,000,000
to spend.” The original agreement looked
just about as bad as an agreement could be.
With almost superhuman- ingenuity' the
“National” Government has shown that it
is possible to make one that is still worse.
Surely the “National” party must see how
completely this puts the State in the hands
of the syndicate; and surely it will speak
plainly and tell these reckless Ministers that
it will not suffer one penny more of this
Norton Griffiths money to be misappropri-
ated ! That the Norton Griffiths syndi-
cate doesn’t object is neither here nor there.
Why should it object? It knows that it is
not going to lose anything. It is in the
position of a moneylender who doesn’t care
two straws how his money is wasted so
long as there is a good name on the back
of the bill. He leaves the worrying to the
man who owns that name; and in this case
the name is N. S. Wales.
What the German Submarine Has
Done for Us.
About the most interesting exhibit at the
A.N.A. exposition in Melbourne is that of
mineral earths with which this island is so
plentifully endowed. Here is-manufactured
talc or soapstone from Heathcote (Vic.),
commonly known as French chalk, a com-
modity used in enormous quantities in a mul-
titude of industries. Here are kaolin, silica,
lime carbonates, ochres, iron oxides, in-
fusorial earth, gypsum, magnesite, alabaster,
barytes and fluor spar. Soecimens of commer-
cial products simply and easily made from
these minerals and earths are shown rang-
ing from alabaster casts down to Epsom
salts,_ and including plaster of paris, common
whiting, putty, ceiling ornaments, ■ telegraph
insulators, bricks to stand 4000 deg. of heat,
impalpable powder for nitro-glycerine, adul-
terants for leather, cloth and silk. Naturally
one asked when the factory which produced
these things was opened, and the reply came.
“Only since the war.” “But' why?”
“Because we had to stop shipping the raw
material to Germany” ! That meant closing
quarries and writing-off capital with the
alternative of working up these valuable
earths on the spot. So they opened the fac-
tory, and can undersell the importers who
are for the moment choked by dear freight
and high insurance. Given a proper Protec-
tive tariff, and there is no need ever to
import either putty or Epson! salts or many
other such things. But when the war is
over we shall be in precisely the same posi-
tion as we were before it started. We didn’t
have the factory then, and we should not
have had it now only for the Protection
which the German submarine imposes
on us. If we want to save that fac-
tory and dozens more we must supply some-
thing to take the place of the abnormal
freights, etc., which are protecting our in-
dustries for the time being; and the only
thing which can take its' place is a high
tariff—a sky-high tariff. Before the war
ends we threaten to have a public debt of
between £500,000,000 and £000,000.000. This
handful of people in Australia has to raise
not only the interest on that amount but a
tremendous annual sum for war pensions;
and it will perform that feat only in travail
unless it saves every saveable penny. We
can’t any longer afford to send away the
money to pay somebody else to make even
our packet of salts.

Joanna Bull’s Vote.
Women’s franchise of a sort appears to have
arrived in Britain. The Speaker’s Electoral
Reform Conference proposes that every
woman on the local government register and
the wife of every man thereon shall have a
vote? provided she has reached the age of 30
or 35. Women graduates of universities are
also recommended for a place on the rolls.
It is a poor “reform”; and the suffragette
view of it that it has merely complicated
things and increased existing inequalities
has good justification. Britain started out
with an insistence on large property qualifi-
cations for male voters, and gradually broad-
ened the franchise until most men had a
vote. The broadening process directly
benefited the people as a whole, and im-
proved the tone and tendency of legislation ;
and only a very dull person would now argue
that a restricted franchise was ever needed
or that legislation was not delayed by it.
The British political person, however, is
very dull; hence the suggestion that female
franchise should go through all the revisions
which marked male franchise, when, obvi-
ously, better results would be achieved by
granting electoral rights to all women.
People may make out a case why women
should not vote at all; but no One is entitled
to the view that Eleanob should go to the
polling place and Jane shouldn’t. The wife
of a man who owns a little property, or who
in virtue of that gets on the roll, is not
likely to know any more about political
issues than the woman who earns her living
in an office —or a factory, for that matter.
In many cases she knows a- lot less, and is
the inferior of the wage-earning person in
education, character and most things else.
Yet an arbitrary line is drawn which must
cause a lot of class feeling, and is of no
benefit to the nation. Still, England does
things like that. While a political war is
raging round the extension of the female
franchise a lot of other reforms must be held
up; and to hold up reforms is the great
business of English party politics.

One cry that stirred the eaters to wild
enthusiasm at the A.N.A. luncheon in Mel-
bourne was uttered by A. E. Seedsman in
proposing the toast of the State Ministry.
“Our hospitals are languishing, whilst right
at hand the Government has a means to help
them. Why not adopt the totalisator ?” The
speaker brought down the house, but he
didn’t bring any sort of reply from the
vociferous Peacock when that most evasive
of Premiers came to talk of everything save
local politics. Joe Cook, however, saw a
chance to be sopbistically satirical. Seeds-
man had remarked that, as he was not a
punter himself, the totalisator would not get
any of his money. Whereupon Joseph
alluded to him as a typical citizen who
favored taxation for other people and exemp-
tion for himself. Thus do politicians habitu-
ally distort the truth to make their little
joke. The totalisator taxes nobody. It
merely takes over from a mob of parasite
bookmakers their business of selling odds on
horse-races, and having taken over the busi-
ness it reduces the cost of the gambling to
those of the public who gamble. There is no
taxation for anyone to be exempt from, as far
as this change of odds-layers is concerned. The
new machine displaces the old established
robber for the benefit of the “investing” pub-
lic. One may fairly argue that Rechabites
get an unfair advantage from the taxes
levied on exhilarating liquors. But the
abstainer from betting has only an infinitesi-
mal financial benefit to gain by a Govern-
ment tax on totalisator revenue. And, instead
of being taxed, as the consumers of Derrink
are, the consumers of odds gain appreciably
by Government installation of a quiet, re-
spectable machine in place of a noisy, dis-
respectable body of bookmakers.
“Rio": As the N. S. Wales Nation il Rifle
Association is talking about a prize meeting
this year (the Government to finance it, of
course) I want to ask:—
If a man is too old, ill, important or married to
go to the war, why on earth should the Government
finance his Saturday-afternoon pastime and call it
patriotism ?
How many battles in the present war have been
won by long-range rifle-fire of the slow, lying-down
variety practised by rifle clubs?
How many by even the rapid, short-range fire of
the military-trained shot?
How many by the pick and shovel, bomb, bayonet
and “condition” ?
If l'ifleclub -men shoot for their country’s s;ike, why
do they not also do a bit of navvying, homhing and
baj-oneting ?
Are not the qualities developed by, say, Rugby
football more useful in a modern war tjian those
developed by rifle-shooting?
Have not a larger percentage of football-club
members enlisted than rifle-club members?
Why does not the Government subsidise football
with free grounds, caretakers, goals, footballs* etc.,
as it does riflemen with ranges, targets, rifles,
ammunition, etc.? And, in addition, give them a
large cash grant for prizes out of the taxpayer's
pocket ?
This cant about present-day riflemen shoot-
ing in order to learn how to defend their
country makes me tired. Ninety prv cent, of
the men firing would be unavailable in war.
They go shooting for the same reason that
others take up bowls or golf. It is a
pleasant, open-air, non-strenuous sport re-
tpiiring a modicum of skill, with most of
the expenses provided by a bulldozed tax-
payer, and with a nice chance of picking up
a few quids at the annual prize-meeting.

How deep has the dry rot eaten into the
Labor crowd! At a special conference of
N. S. AVales unions to devise ways and
means of getting work, the leaders of the
movement called upon the Parliamentarians
to go further into debt to the capitalist and
wade deeper into the bog of interest. An
addendum from the Rubber Workers’
delegate to prohibit unnecessary importa-
tions was ruled out, as it “would compli-
cate matters!” In 1915 the rubber indus-
try had over £1,000,000 invested, employed
22114 hands in 26 factories, and produced
goods worth £1,076,263. Rut in the same
year Australia imported rubber goods worth
£1.441,003 —mostly from German-Americans.
Raw rubber was shipped from Ceylon and
the Federated Malay States to London, from
there to the U.S., then back again to Aus-
tralia. At the present time 600 rubber-
workers are busy hunting for unskilled
workers’ jobs. With adequate Protection
the rubber people were prepared to get the
raw rubber required from New Guinea and
the Federated Malay' States (50 per cent,
of the rubber that the U.S. digests goes
from Ceylon and the Malay Statesl, to work
round the clock, to employ another 2000
hands and train them and make them effici-
ent rubber workers. The offer aroused no
interest —it was merely listened to. These
shiftless loan-eaters are now crying for
£0,000,000 of someone else’s money in order
that they may not starve. And last year
they supplied others, mostly foreigners, with
work worth £64,000,000.

In an earnest appeal to the nation to
grapple with the venereal plague the Eng-
lish Review (December) gives a warning
which the warward-bound Australian ought
to pin in his hat: —
The unpleasant truth is that never lias there been
so wide-spread a syphilitic taint in London as at
the present hour. In London there is no control
of prostitutes. . . .and war has broken down the
conventional sex barriers, so that men accost women
openly and meet with an easy response; in fact,
the whole face of London has changed in this con-
nection and now every girl has her soldier and
many of them several soldiers. Then there is the
flapper phenomenon, so that it is not surprising
that the flapper on the f-treets has ended in the
flapper syphilitic, who goes about infecting the
soldiers by the dozen....ln the town centres their
[the soldiers’] ranks are being far more than deci-
mated.
In this matter the first thing to be done
is to control prostitution and penalise un-
professional prostitution; and if it doesn’t
owe it to itself to do this, England at least
owes it to the Australians who are ordered
to England to train. “The disease is more
prevalent here than in Egypt,” an officer
writes to The Bulletin from London, “and
it is unchecked. I should say that at least
one-eighth of our men are already affected
more or less—mostly less, I believe, for the
type is certainly not as bad as it was in
Egypt.” In this matter England is not
playing the game with us.
“Flathead” : It is on the cards that the
old trouble between George Black and the
three imported skippers on the three im-
ported N.S.W. State trawlers will end in a
maritime hold-up. When the foreigners
arrived in Sydney, Black, as a good union-
ist, told them to join a union. They de-
murred ; Black insisted, and they obeyed.
Later on the Minister had a tiff with them
over the 1100th application for more pay
for somebody on the fish boats. In the ensu-
ing disturbance the Chief Sec. found him-
self up against his own joss. .Tust as things
were getting heated the political kaleido-
scope shifted and Black made way for
Fuller. The latter flatly refused to have
anything to do with the skippers, and laid
up his fleet. He has now got them going
again with scratch crews, but unionism is
on the warpath. The Marine Engineers, a
powerful body, has been prevailed on to
call out its members from the tubs, and
Fuller has been threatened that there’s
more to follow if the imported barracoutas,
whom Black forced into a union, are not
put back on the bridge. As a back-hander
Beeby. Minister for Labor, has moved to
cancel the registration of the Masters and
Engineers’ Association, to which body all
the trouble is attributed. It has been sus-
pected recently .that the Government de-
sires a trial of strength with militant
unionism, and if Labor fights there is the
chance of a big row. For which God be
praised! We haven’t had an industrial row
for nearly a week !
That experienced apologist, Defence Min-
ister Pearce, last week fed the press with
a little bit of praise from “an experienced
remount officer” who was delighted with
the quality of Australian remounts. Of
course Australian horses are good by
comparison with those from other countries
—they always were. But unless the testi-
mony of disinterested Australian experts
in the trade is all wrong, the army buyers
who are so difficult to cater for have
acquired an unfair quantity of four-footec!
blanks. If the unnamed “experienced re-
mount officer” had anything to do with
selecting the Australian horses it is only -
natural that he should be perfectly satisfied.
And if he had nothing to do with the buy-
ing and never saw the good horses that were
The Awakening.

Miles Standisii stirs. Smiling, he long
endured
The insult of the universal foe.
Men deemed his ancient valor curbed and
cured
Hy gold that round him seethed to surge and
flow.
They mocked a rugged manhood run to seed,
With “bull” and “bear” replacing faith and
deed.
Miles Standisii stirs. The trumpet at his
lips
May send a shattering music down the
world,
Till, in the red flame of his battleships,
The banners of uneasy shame are furled.
As freedom’s foremost champion once he
strode;
World-harvests ripened from the blood he
sowed.
Miles Standisii stirs. Twice in his might
he rose
When all a carping world believed him dead ;
And twice, before his truth, his broken foes
Shuddered to hear his army’s mighty tread
Moving with awful purpose to its end —•
A staff of fire that might not break nor
bend.
Miles Standisii stirs. The large world
holds its breath.
■Trimly the Teuton smiles behind his guns.
Xot yet his power, enhanced by shame and
death,
lias met the stern, unyielding faith that

In long tradition from grey Plymouth
Rock....
Does it run still? The world awaits the

The Australian Farmers’ Opportunity.
Farmers’ insurance business is highly profitable. It helps to provide insurance
company shareholders with handsome dividends. And mostly these shareholders
have little further interest in the welfare of the farmer. In fact some are merely
investors who live thousands of miles from Australia.
If farmers’ insurance is so profitable, why should not the Australian farmer
himself secure the profits from his business? With that object in view, an
insurance co. founded on the best co-operative basis made its appearance a
couple of years ago.
S Settlers’ Co-operative Insurance Co. of A
This is THE Farmers’ Insurance Co.
A farmer Avho becomes a shareholder and places his insurances with this co. participates in the profits which his business creates.
Over 1000 farmers are already shareholders. The profits from the first year’s operations enabled the co. to pay shareholders a DIVIDEND
OF SIX PER CENT.

doesn’t know much about one of the prin-
cipal causes of complaint. The other prin-
cipal cause is that breeders don’t know from

The German Dive Under Water.
After everything appropriate has been said
about German frightfulness and ’he barbar-
isation of war, which is a barbarous busi-
ness anyway, and the iniquity of the treat-
ment promised by Berlin to neutrals, the
best thing to do is have a look at the. job
on hand. It is with torpedoes and mines,
not with threats, that the German intends
to try to sweep the seas. And it is
by sinking his ships, not by making speeches,
that he will be prevented from doing it. If
the submarine can isolate Britain: then Ger-
many will not lose tlx, Such an
achievement would be VqdTvalent to the
destruction of the North Sea fleet.. Can
the Germa’n succeed? The-answer is hid-
den behind the days to come. In his favor
there is the very important fact that the pos-
sibilities of the submarine have been well
tested and that this latest enterprise lias
been long prepared for. On the other side
great encouragement to hope that the Ger-
man will be beaten at his own game is
to be found in the magnitude of the
preparations made to entertain him, in the
success of armed merchantmen at evading
disaster, the unplesantness handed out to
Zeppelins, and the calamity which overtook
the first submarine campaign by the enemy.
But that the shadow is dark is beyond dis-
nute. If the navy fails —good night. It
the German fails it may be good night for
him —quickly. For our encouragement it
is a fair thing to say that there are all the
indications, of despair in his last move. Fvery
line of the recent communication to W ash-
ington seemed to have been written by a
Hun conscious that his was
hard-pressed. Meanwhile Australia is battling
on, liopine- that even if sufficient reinforce-
ments are not despatched to help the army
fight, someone or other will be despatched to
help Lloyd George talk. In the view of
most of the daily papers and of all the
politicians it is infinitely more important to
recruit the spruikers than the fighters.

“Pint Pot”: The modesty of the civil
servant! N. S. Wales Public Service Associ-
ation is inviting competitive designs for
a membership badge, to bear the Associa-
tion’s motto, “Rempublicam Servere, which
means “To save the State.” Even if Percy,
of the Lands, does think he is the. Atlas
who carries the *Ma State to salvation on
his shoulders, he needn’t wear a badge
bragging about it. But perhaps bad Latin,
and not conceit, is the explanation. Maybe
the Association is trying to say Retpubltcae
Servire ” —to serve the State.
On the High Court bench Justice Isaacs
has been unable to agree with the majority
on 37 occasions in six years. In
he jarred his brother wigs 11 times. His
Honor has fought like a good Australian
for a liberal interpretation of the Constitu-
tion ; but Chief Justice Griffith is hard to
shift from the narrow path. The C.J. has
dissented on eight occasions on which the
more democratic interpretation of law has
prevailed—all in recent years, since Isaacs
has been joined by Rich and Duffy. Barton
his differed 10 times from the prevailing
opinion; generally lie has sided with the
Chief.
Henry St. George, whose death in London
is reported by cable, was well known in
Australia as examiner for one of the English
musical bodies to which this country un
necessarily pays thousands of pounds in fees
every year. He was an all-round musician,
though, like most of the moderns, lie had no
ambition to look the part. The fiddle was
his pet instrument, but he was also com-
poser, authority on the instruments of the
past, and a voluminous writer. He was a
charming companion, and only about o 0
when the end came.
“Six-and-Eight” makes a correction: —
The late Mrs. Emily Paul’s husband, Colonel
Alfred Paul, is still alive and residing in Bathurst.
He was the officer entrusted by N. S. Wales in pre-
Federation days with the establishment of the Public
School Cadet force, and the scheme he adopted was
practically identical with that for compulsory mili-
tary service outlined by Kitchener for the Australian
Government.

“Fair and Warmer,” by Avery Ilopwood,
which an imported English company pre-
sented for the first time at Sydney Criterion
on Saturday, is a great moral lesson in two
acts and a bedroom. There is nothing in it
that would shock the most hardened
debauchee: the bed is not even a twin-bed.
It is a stern indictment of the heinous sin
of wowserism : it is a sermon in cocktails. It
is full of wholesome uplift that will bring a
little ray of hope into the dullness of those
who are happily married. Billy and Laura
Bartlett were happily married. Billy was the
perfect husband. He did not drink, he did
not smoke, and. worst of all, he was merely
“FAIR AND WARMER,” AT SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Harry Sweeney and Mrs. Bartlett (Daisy
Atherton) discover Mr. Bartlett making his
debut as a drinker.
“a one-woman man.” He never went out at
night looking like one thing to come home
next morning looking like another. He had
no yearnings for a harem; he really felt
that he couldn’t love 20 women; and his wife
always knew where he was. Naturally his
wife got tired of the perfect husband, and, in
that casual way they have in N’Yark, she
determined to divorce him. Jack Wheeler
was the other sort of husband, who had early
learnt the first lesson in matrimony—to keep
his little Blanche always guessing where he
was and when and how he would come home.
Jack converts the wowser to bis creed, and
when the patient Blanche and the perfect
wowser are left alone in the wowser’s flat
they make up their minds to be found in a
compromising position when the errant hus-
band and the flighty wife come home. But
it is harder than they think, until the happy
inspiration comes to them to mix a cocktail.
They don’t know anything about cocktails;
but apparently you can mix cocktails any-
how and the result will be satisfactory.
That cocktail and a bottle or two of cham-
pagne that follow are the first steps up-
wards to the better life. The amateur sinners
get delightfully drunk, and the compromising
situation which, in their unregenerate sober
moments they had vainly sought, arrives of
its own accord. Next morning there is The
Headache. But no great moral reform is
effected without suffering; and the converted
wife, discovered under the wowser’s bed,
knows that for the future she will always
keep her husband guessing; while the
wowser, caught kissing the maid, learns with
delight that his wife has no further desire to
divorce him. The drama is one that is to be
commended to all those who are hopelessly
happily-married. No film-play has more
earnestly denounced the immorality of the
husband who is perfect or the wife who is
always there when she is wanted.
A pleasing innovation in the presentation
of this farce is the use of the English lan-
guage. The play is set in New York, but the
company that so brilliantly interprets it uses
our own speech. And the new English
Comedy Company has been admirably chosen.
Thomas A. Braidon. the immaculate husband
who learns all there is to know about cock-
tails, proves himself a subtle and experienced
actor. His wowserism is almost as delight-
ful as his drunkenness. His partner in cock-
tails, Elma K.oyton, is the most charming
and convincing female drunk that this paper
has ever had the privilege of meeting. She
takes her liquor like a lady, and neatly
shows in the earlier scenes the pathetic and
deplorable innocence of the devoted wife.
The contrast between her innocence and her
alcoholic exuberance is cleverly indicated.
Percy Marmont, the errant husband, is a
finished actor with a taking personality.
Daisy Atherton, the wife of the wowser,
manages a somewhat difficult part with
success; and May Nightingale does the same
with the obvious part of a flirtatious maid.
Harry Sweeney, the harmless but necessary
villain, is well placed. The only really
unmoral part of the show are the awful
color-effects of the furniture.
This fairly-warm morality play is evi-
dently booked for a long season of uplift.
“The Cinema Star” fades out of Sydney
Majesty’s on Friday. “The Orchid” blooms
again for the JtCoyal Comics next evening.
“The Bunyip” is still wearing its 1000
costumes and singing its 30 songs for the
enraptured Fullers at the Grand Opera
House, Sydney. The 60th performance of
the all-Australian show was reeled off dur-
ing the week.
The Taits plunge into the musical-comedy
trade on Saturday at the redecorated Sydney
Palace. “Very Good Eddie” is the first pro-
duction by a new company headed by Barry
Lupino in the name-part. “Eddie” ran for
12 months in New York and wore out 183
pairs of boots.
Sydney Tivoli is once more wearing plain
vaudeville; and, on the whole, it seems to
be the Tivoli’s best suit. Australian Fred
Bluett, back again after four lucky years
in England, sings at the head of the bill
and makes a profit in his own country by
virtue of the added credit he won by getting
away from it. Sydney baritone Malcolm
McEachern supplies an artistic turn, for
which everyone seems to be properly grate-
ful ; and Marie King Scott, -with suspenders
showing, obliges again with her quaintly-
humorous turn. Lady Sen Mei (singer),
Togos (Jap jugglers), and Belle Oliver are
also among those present.
To-night the Dandies will say a melodious
farewell to patrons of the Garden Theatre

Film stars in Sydney this week: —
Lyceum and Crystal Palace : Billie Burke in
another delightful chapter of “Gloria’s Romance.”
Usual news and comedy features at both shows.
Lyric and Empress: Charlie Chaplin’s freak humor
on rollers in “The Rinlc.”
Hoyt’s: “The Stolen Triumph,” a Metro play
about players, including Harry Burkhardf, once well
known on Australian boards.
Carnival is now a consistent feature of
the White City, Sydney’s most attractive
playground, and the master of the revels is
hard put to it thinking out new schemes
for joy-nights. The Bulletin passes him
one from Nice—the battle of flowers, which
ought really to be adopted by Sydney itself.
“The Bells,” which is a very lurid little
melodrama, never looked more lurid than at
Melbourne Princess’s last Saturday. Allan
Wilkie’s behavidr at the end of each act
was rather more conventionally theatrical
than the old business associated with the
name of Irving—business in which 11.8.,
who played “The Bells” at Her Majesty’s
some five years ago, gave a precise imitation
of his more impressive parent. Blit, for all
its violent insistence on the hysteria of the
fearstruck Burgomaster, the drama that
Leopold Lewis translated from the French is
about the neatest and most concise of the
many dream-plays that have survived. It is
free from non-essentials. The minor comedy
characters give tbe atmosphere of crude pro-
vincial jollity in a snow-bound village. And
the dramatist keeps one interested always in
his main idea, viz., that a shrewd, ill-educated
man with a murder on his mind could, after
seeing people mesmerised on a public plat-
form, become obsessed with a dread of being
himself forced by hypnotic influence to own
up to his crime of long ago. Mathias was
fear-stricken,- not conscience-stricken. He
was not haunted by unpleasant recollections
until he had seen other respectable citizens
put to sleep and heard them talk. Then he
began to behold visions and suffer from imag-
inary sounds of sleigh-bells, and at last he
•' icd a dream that frightened him to
death.
There is only one possible reading of the-
part. Wilkie in most places is as like the
Irvings as his countenance and elocution
permit. He hasn’t a flexible, melodious
voice, or a wide range of facial expression
But he makes his points artistically in the
first two acts, without laying undue stress
on his recognition of a piece of blood-money
among the coins saved up for his daughter’s
dowry, lie is powerful, but not so strikingly
picturesque as Irving was. In the dream
scene he fairly held the audience, despite a
rather foolish attempt to add realism to the
situation by introducing nightmare groans
from the bedroom where lie had previously
retired. With Wilkie acting on the stage'in
front of them it was evident to the audience
that he couldn’t possibly be the person mak-
ing a. noise in the bedroom at the side. Cos-
grove, who is only a little too loud and broad
in style, and I)ore, who is hardly broad
enough,- have the best of the minor charac-
ter parts. Y. Edwards is an amiable young
lover in an unsympathetic uniform, and Miss
Marie Ney is quite charming as the unim-
portant ingenue Annette.
“The Bells” is preceded by a one-act
comedy of the calm, matter-of-fact husband,
the hare-brained wife and the serio-comic
lover. It is probably of French origin,
bright in dialogue and conventionally arti-
ficial in plot. Miss Hunter-Watts, Hunt and
Dore seemed strange to the work on Satur-
day, but are doubtless doing better now.
Allen Doone, still exercising his blarney
at Melbourne King’s, scarcely challenges
comparison with Andrew Mack, who intro-
duced Erin’s tamest poet to Melbourne about
10 years ago. Nature had fattened Mack for
the role of Tom Moore, and had given him a
manner that, despite its theatricalism, was
all butter and blandishment. Doohe, on the
other hand, is disqualified from the start by
physical shortcomings. He gives the Irish
Laureate the contours of an ironing-board
and a personality to match, and seems about
the last to occupy the foreground in a
maiden’s tender thoughts. To be sure, he
achieves a sort of prominence, but it is
artificially contrived by the old trick of re-
ducing the other characters to the rank of
spectators and knocking them silly with
subtle badinage. As a matter of fact, none
of his' supporters have very much to do, bar-
ring Edna Keeley and Onslow Edgeworth.
And Edna amounts to no more than a pair
of bright eyes and a procession of peevish
exclamations. Occasionally, however, she
jostles Allan for the* limelight by suddenly
exposing the genius of her dressmaker. As
for Edgeworth, designed as the lady-killer,
Percival Lovelace, he only becomes an im-
potent exquisite by holding the mirror up to
himself and leaving Percival out of it alto-
gether. It is a pity that Percival had not a
stronger exponent, for he makes the play by
ordaining Edna to be the head-liner on his
list of houris, and moving Heaven, earth and

MELBOURNE
ROYAL.

The panto, at Melbourne Majesty’s pro-
ceeds as in its early days, except that the
Demon of Despair is now danced by Miss
Sylvester instead of by Charles Albert.
Despair is the person who dogs the footsteps
of Maggie Dickinson for awhile, and even
goes so far as to push her down when the
rest of the ballet isn’t looking. Eventually,
however, dear little Maggie rises triumphant,
on her toes, and the principal boy discovers
the glittering casket, or what-not, and Fairy
Goodenougli waves her wand, and all is well.
It is hard to discover the exact meaning of
the ballet that begins in the Tulip Farm and
lasts through several changes of scene. It
seems a beautiful mystery whereof Maggie
Dickinson may have lost the key. Or per-
haps it is too poetic to have any coherence
to speak of.
At a show of home-grown art
Numerous Australian artists have something to
say in the big A.N.A. display at Melbourne Exhibi-
tion. F. R. Crozier, now at the B’ront, hangs a
topical subject—-a war-smitten interior entitled
“Aftermath.” It would require an auctioneer’s clerk
to catalogue the details, but principal features are
an elderly lady reading a letter and a wounded
warrior who seems to be sharing with the spectator
a feeling of perplexity as to what it’s all about.
Somewhat mystifying also are the dim allegories of
Miss Christian Yandell. She pictures her fancies
with a Baudelairean spread of gangrenous hues. It
is a pleasure to turn to the nicely-handled “Grand-
mother’s Gown” of Sergeant Charles Wheeler, and
there is honest painting in the ( femininely effusive
canvases of Miss Cumbrae Stewart. Miss Violet
Teague has her usual set of aristocratic-looking
ladies. Clearly Miss Teague’s prayer is: “Give us
this day our daily breed.” Her study of Archibald
Strong is much more human. She has caught the
Professor with his pedantry suppressed and a
birthday-party smile on his rectangular visage. Allan
Wilson is represented by a self-made portrait that
looks as though it was satisfied with its creator.
Percy Reason furnishes a pathetic view of John
McDouall Stuart almost lost in the sunburnt scenery.
F. H. Bruford puts his name to a large expanse
of wind and water, and Harry McClelland tries to
dispose of several acres of unreal estate. Ilis gaudy
“Golden Autumn” would keep a policeman awake.
There is also a gigantic “Township,” in which
practically everything but a tree and a horse appears
to be buried in the composition. Hal Waugh’s talent
flickers momentarily and disappears in two or three
little things of no great artistic value. The
diligent and clever Louis McCubbin applauds our
lovely landscape with a palette swimming in pea-
green. Montague Brown’s pretentious gumscape,
“Arbores Juvenes Patriae,” is merely a pile of
prospective firewood. C. E. S. Tindall’s water-colors
are dexterous but uninspiring, and E. Fraser's Eng-
lish and Belgian sketches are done in a tasteful
though academic manner. A Mt. Dandenong after-
noon shows W. Nicholls Anderson nearly at his best,
and a glimpse of Adelaide from Glen Osmond brings
Archibald Collins’s craftsmanship into notice. C.
Bowman Fletcher holds- his palette up to Meldrum
in a portrait. The signature is very fine. Cobb’s
etchings are again in considerable force, while among
the pastellists Miss Farr and Miss Wilson don’t
demonstrate any super-excellence in the graceful
medium. Miss Ethel Jackson-Morris, who has a
vein of fantasy, is revealing a tendency to introduce
a kindergarten class to the Raekham school. But
the worst stuff in the show is partially hidden away
in an annexe off the second gallery. The landscapes
in this section would be too dreadful to live with,
while, respecting two horribly butchered nudes, this
writer can only say that he has never seen anything
in which the art of assassination is so cleverly com-
bined with the assassination of art.
At Melbourne Royal they are about to
close “The House of Glass” and stage a
whimsical sentimental comedy, with no
crooks in it. Miss Florence Rockwell, the
leading lady, will take the name-part in “The
Misleading Lady.”
Annette Kellerman, divinely fair and
divingly audacious, is performing on the
screen at Melbourne Auditorium these times.
It is an odd-shaped fairy-story that Annette
figures in, and she mostly figures in attrac-
tive undress. Starting as the soul of a dicky
bird in a gilded cage, she becomes “A Daugh-
ter of the. Gods” in search of her soul-mate,
who turns out to be an estimable but
strangely unsatisfactory young prince;
Annette,, in fact, has bad luck all through
the 2 A hours of beautiful moving picture.
The mermaids of the sea do their best to give
her a good wet time, and the gnomes, who
are a heavily-whiskered community, clap
their hands when she dives from high places
into a gentle stream ; but they can’t change
her luck. A wicked old Sultan, inspired by
an ancient lady who travels on a broomstick,
and directed by the star lady of his harem,
orders' Annette to be burned at the stake,
thrown into a preserve of hungry crocodiles,
and drowned in the whirling rapids. This
last atrocity is evidently the most trying
ordeal that A Daughter of the Gods goes
through, for the foaming torrent treats her
as though she were a cork. Finally, she
leads a heroic army of converted gnomes
against the Sultan’s forces, and is slain by
her own best boy. The long film is admit-
tedly designed to interest children, in which
respect it comes as a change from the social-
sermon pictures dedicated to grown-ups only.
The Passing Show is to appear at Mel-
bourne Tivoli on Saturday and endeavor to
remove the feeding.of ennui caused by the
now-departed Follies. In the meanwhile
two or three of the Follies and some other
' people are filling in time cheerfully in a
mixed vaudeville programme. Eminent
among these fleeting entertainers is De
Forrest, a card king who commences his
slick act fro™ a seat in the stalls. Ella
Caspers, Goossens the Belgian, and Short
and Little reappear; Miss Lingarde discloses
her unclassical figure in classical poses;
while Rose and Dell do an acrobatic and
biking act made noisy by the infrequent
silence of Dell. Also there are a couple of
painful Amurkans who pool their meagre
vocal resources to the immense applause of
the ushers at the back of the house.
The Dandies are still at the old address
on St. Kilda (Vic.) Esplanade. At present
they are reviving their musical revue, “The
Seaside Hotel,” wherein Joseph Brennan
scores as a humorous pub porter, and Ford
Waltham is conspicuous as a beach pierrot.
In the first part Linda Ockleshaw’s dancing
continues to be a mild novelty without
amounting to an innovation. Also Lalla
Ward is a strong vocal asset as before. Last
week she was caught trespassing in “Love’s
Garden of Roses,” but she did it so nicely
that she will be discharged with a caution.
William Farnum is appearing in “The
Man from Bitter Roots” at Hoyt’s principal
Melbourne house this week. There is a
pretty girl-reporter in the tangled story, and
she furnishes a soft resting-place for Wil-
liam’s weary head after he has dodged a
fraudulent charge of homicide. Lionel Barry-
more is playing the strenuous triple role of
broker,. stoker and highwayman in the long-
distance special, “Dorian’s Divorce.” Oppo-
site Lionel is a new star, Grace Valentine,
with more natural aptitude for her job than
the average screen novice owns.
After the rejection of bis rolled-gold peace
proposals, the Kaiser sent a whirling message
to his Prussians telling them that they were
boiling with wrath arid filled with new
courage. After two and a half years of it
they would much rather be boiling with soup
and filled with new cabbage.
Abdul is not all bad: There are pictures
in circulation of orderly Gallipoli graveyards
showing that he has scrupulously kept his
promise that the mound above good old Bill-
jim shall not be desecrated. Around one of
the plots is a line of the same barbed wire
that, having checked the living in their
glorious rush at the Landing, now protects
the uncaring dead. The pictures were taken
since the evacuation, and there is evidence
that the graves have been not only preserved
but kept in order.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Ancient Prompter”: I have not seen
Harry Bracy’s age mentioned in any obit-
uary notice. Probably no one in Australia
knew it. He retained his slim, dapper
appearance almost to the last —a rather
unusual happening with tenors, who run, as a
rule, to fat. Yet it is all 45 years since
Bracy was an accepted light-opera artist in
London, where he sang the tenor roles in the
first English productions of “Madame
Favart,” “Olivette,” etc., with Florence St.
John, taking the town by storm in the leads.
Settling in Australia, Bracy developed into
a splendid all-round man under ,T. C. Wil-
liamson—operatic artist, stage-director, pro-
ducer and business-manager in turn. Never
was there a cooler and more imperturbable
stage-boss. On one of the rare occasions
when his equanimity was disturbed he was
producing “Madame Butterfly,” and rather
upset the Italian conductor by breaking up
the old-fashioned seini-circle of the chorus
into picturesque groups. The maestro wanted
the choristers where they could all follow
his beat. “Mr. Bracy,” lie exposulated, “re-
member this is not a pantomime.” “No, and
it isn’t an oratorio,” said Bracy.

“0.K.”: My personal recollection of
Henry Bracy dates back to a time when he
was the good-looking but inanimate young
tenor of a comic-opera co. at the little
Strand Theatre (Lon.), the prima-donna
being Florence St. John. That may have
been previous to his first visit to Australia
in the Julia Matthews days. Anyhow, he
was back on the London stage more than
35 years ago, and it was not until the end
of 1800 that he happened again in Australia
and got a billet with Williamson and Mus-
grove. Bracy’s first appearance under the
firm’s management was in the never-popular
opera “Marjorie.” Florence Savile, daughter
of the Simonsens, sang the name-part splen-
didly. Bracy and his wife (the Clara
Thompson of their former days in Australia)
were more or less associated with W. and
M. for five or six years. Then the tenor
started his own co., and with “The Beggar
Student',” “Nemesis” and other things he
kept going in opposition to the bigger show.
This battling resulted in Williamson giving
him a good, easy billet to keep him out of
management; and his last years of active
life were passed in the service and friend-
ship of J.C.W., who, by the way, remembered
him in his will. He was the trimmest and
most serenely dispositioned theatrical stager
that ever I met. As an actor he never lose
his woodenness. lie was always a mechani-
cal, sweet-voiced, unimpassioned tenor, nor
did his smooth. s\Veet voice ever have much
color in it. And it faded until Albert
Whelan’s imitation of it was screamingly
funny.
“Ami” : Henry Bracy and his wife came to
Australia over 40 years ago, and seemed to
have made a false step. In England they
were in good business, with influential con-
nections, while in the Melbourne of ’7O their
outlook was so-precarious that Bracy had to
join the stock, and even descended to such
little parts as Guildenstern, in “Hamlet.”
However, Lyster was then finding, out that
managers cannot live by grand opera alone.
He had to fall back more and more on light
opera, and thus the Bracys got their chance.
Mrs. Bracy (Clara Thompson) always had
a defective voice; but her splendid industry
and high intelligence took her to the top.
Bracy knew his own limitations, and would
wisely play second to Beaumont. Meanwhile
Lydia Thompson, Clara’s sister, was doing
well in England and America; and I fancy
she drew the Bracys back to London. Bracy
was there terribly unlucky in management,
and lost pretty well his all over an opera
called “The Lady of the Locket.” Back again
with us, all was plain sailing for as excellent
a couple as ever adorned the stage.
“Super”: Henry Bracy was one of the
few men able to boast that, in the old days
at the London Savoy,, he had, without
authority, changed a piece of business ir.
one of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and
lived to tell the tale. As the Hilarion
of the original production of “Prince-is
Ida,” Bracy took upon himself in one scene
to stand instead of kneel at the foot of a
column, as stipulated in the stage direc-
tions, for the reason that in kneeling he
disturbed the fit of his elegant garments.
The next morning he received a note from
the office informing him that the alteration
had been observed; but, luckily for him,
Gilbert had approved of the change, and the
message went on to tell him that he was
at liberty for the future to stand while
reciting the lines. Both Gilbert and Sulli-
van, as a rule, fiercely resented any altera-
tion of their directions. They supervised
the production of all their operas at the
Savoy, and dictated every move in the
stage business. It was at a rehearsal of
“Pinafore” that one of the principals, when
directed by Gilbert to “sit down pensively”
on the hatch of the ship, flung himself down
and fell through, since the carpenter had
only covered the hatch with make-shift can-
vas. “That’s not pensively,” exclaimed
Gilbert; “that’s expensively !”
“Harrison O.”: It was not alone rever-
ence for the old English comedies that moved
me to protest against the gagging which
“0.K.” (B. 1/2/T7) appears to find such a
gratifying feature of Allan Wilkie’s produc-
tions. Meeting similar puerilities in a
modern musical comedy, I would have felt
that to snort was a duty I owed to the
thousands —nay, millions —of readers who
look to me for guidance In theatrical
matters. But no musical comedy or panto-
mime of my acquaintance has contained any-
thing more banal than some of Wilkie’s
efforts. For “0.K.” to defend a gag on the
ground that it is “what Goldsmith doubt-
less would have put into the situation had
he thought of it” is pure humbug. Without
proclaiming Goldsmith and Sheridan literary
demigods, the things they thought of strike
me as somewhat superior to the thoughts of
any mummers who have come my way.
I compared an actor who messes with the
work of a first-class dramatist with a scene-
painter who would add a few touches to a
Corot landscape or a vaudeville musician
who would interfere with Puccini. “0.K.”
calls the comparison preposterous. But
where is the difference? Why should
the art of a great writer be tam-
pered with any more than that of a
painter, sculptor or musician? Gilbert used
to declare that he would shoot the scoundrel
who tried to work a gag into one of his
librettos, and had he carried out the threat
any jury of literary men would have re-
turned a verdict of justifiable homicide.
Also, knowing “0.K.,” methinks (why
shouldn’t I methink, too?) I can hear the
burning words of scorn he would .direct at
the base knave who, lacking metrical skill,
subjected “The Kiss of Dolly Day” to the
treatment Wilkie meted out to “She Stoops
to Conquer.”

IF FOOD DISAGREES
DRINK HOT WATER.
When food lies like lead in the stomach
and you have that uncomfortable, distended
feeling, it is because of insufficient blood
supply to the stomach, combined with acid
and food fermentation. In such cases try
the plan now followed in many hospitals and
advised by eminent specialists of taking half
a teaspoonful of bisurated magnesia in half
a glass of water as .hot as you com-
fortably drink it. The hot water draws the
blood to the stomach, and the iisurated mag-
nesia, as any physician or chemist can tell
you, instantly neutralises the acid and stops
the food fermentation. Try this simple plan
and you will be astonished at the immediate
feeling of relief and comfort that always
follows the restoration of the normal process
of digestion. Soldiers at the front and trav-
ellers who are frequently obliged to take
hasty meals poorly prepared should always
take two or three five-grain tablets of bisu-
rated magnesia after meals to m-event fer-
mentation and neutralise the acid. — Advt.

by the way, is “Goldy’s” sheet anchor. He
has even got branches of it in Ballarat,
Bendigo and Castlemaine. If you want a
contemptuous opinion on the whole outfit go
to the grand establishment lately opened in
Flinders-street by - the Wharf Laborers’
Union. But all would be well if the mis-
sioners would cease reading back numbers
of The Girls’ Own Paper and meet the
seaman as just a hard-case citizen.
“Hamer”: Re the early Armstrong bac-
teries (B. 25/1/T7). Mercer’s, sent to
M.L., was not more successful than the
battery despatched to China, which "The
Old Soldier” met. It failed to make any
impression on the powerful entrenchments
of the Maoris at Rangiriri on the Waikato;
and its commander fell in leading a forlorn-
hope charge on the stronghold—an unusual
thing for an artillery commander to do. A
trench was dug out towards where he lay,
and a Dr. Temple and others went and
brought him in. A V.C. and other honors
were distributed; but the highest honor
should have gone to a Maori chief (Teoreore,
I think) who dashed out, although friends
and foes were both firing his way, and re-
moved the wounded man .to the compara-
tively sheltered position wdience he was •
recovered by Temple. Yet the gallant Maori
didn’t even get a beer.

“F.N.T.”: It was recently suggested bj
The Bulletin that what the gospel of the
defunct Chidley really needs to give it a
lift is a lady Chid. There used to be an
ensevnble sisterhood in the U.S.A. It mostly
lived and moved and had its peanuts in the
“woods” surrounding a neat and comfortable
establishment where teachings, largely relat-
ing to the folly of footwear and the crimin-
ality of corsets, were absorbed on rainy
days. The main plank in the association’s
platform was No Wardrobe Whatever, so
it was an embarrassing time for Officer
O’Reilly when the sisterhood fell foul of
the Law and had to be summoned to appear
at court. O’Reilly and his summons were
affably received by the Chief Altogetheress,
a stout lady clad iightly in a kind smile and
a good head of hair, and he was politely in-
vited to stay to lunch and see more of the
Plan. O’Reilly, as it happened, had plans
of his own, including one named Bridget:
and he remembered Bridget in time and
fled.
“Carry On”: He had just been made
orderly to his captain and was receiving
instructions. “You-are to rise at five o’clock,
shave yourself and clean your boots and
equipment. Then- you clean my boots, but-
tons, belt, etc., shave me, see to my horse,
which must be groomed thoroughly, and
clean the equipment. After that you help
to serve breakfast and after breakfast lend
a hand in washing up. At eight o’clock you
go on parade and drill till 12 and then”
By this time young Billjim was bursting.
“ ’Struth,” he exploded, “isn’t there anybody
in the army except me !”

“F.C.”: Melbourne City Council’s
scheme of licensing a dozen or so fruit-
kiosks or barrows at certain street corners
and hunting off all those sinners who used
to supply the eager public with fruit at
half the price charged in city
shops has had the effect of
creating a close corporation.
To-day you cannot buy a
pound of decent peaches in or
around Melbourne for less
than 3d., and you will pay
4d. and 6d. a lb. for choicer
goods. As the grower can
hardly scare Bs. a case out of
his customers and there are
401 b. to 451 b. in a case, it is
evident there is a discrepancy
somewhere. The grower hav-
ing a heavy crop of peaches
is at present moving heaven
and earth to find fresh mar-
kets and persuade “the fac-
tories” to buy the fruit for
canning and jam making. “The
factories”—which, as far as'
Victoria and Tasmania are
concerned, means three com-
panies—are not taking much
fruit, having heavy stocks of
pulp from last year’s crop, and
the “fresh markets” are not
easily discoverable. If the
fruitgrower would but organise
himself and pay as much at-
tention lo distributing as lie
does to producing, he would
need to worry less about the
disposal of his stuff. But in
that matter he seems hope-
less ; if he weren’t his success
in getting rid of last year’s glut of apples
would have taught him a point.

After 41 years’ service the cable-station
at Wakapuaka, near Nelson (M.L.). is to
be abandoned. When the line was laid be-
tween Maoriland and Sydney it was believed
that the land station must be placed as close
to the sea-cable as possible; but that idea
has been blown out. The M.L. end of the
line will now be in Wellington G.P.O. The
Hibernia and Edinburgh laid the cable
from La Perouse to Farewell Spit, thence
to “Waka,” the final splice being made
at 1 p.m. on February 18, 1876. The charge
for messages was 7s. 6d. for 10 words, which
was cheap, considering that the Eastern Ex-
tension Co. then required £9 6s. 6d. to send
20 words from Adelaide to London. But
the Tasman service was subsidised and the
other wasn't.
“Y.Z.” : With shrill enthusiasm tlie united
Melbourne press sets itself to convince the
public that the A.N.A. annual show at the
Exhibition Building is a gorgeous display, of
immense value to the nation, and reflecting
such a glare of credit upon the Association
and all concerned that there is danger of
many semi-eminent gentlemen being blinded
by it. Now, I saw the exhibition early in
its first week, and in plain truth it was
deplorably dull and miserably unrepresenta-

tive and misleading. Certain items of in-
terest have escaped inside, but the displays .
as a whole are about as novel as the average
Swanston-street window, and all sorts of
little catch-penny items are squeezed iu. As
to the variety entertainment, well, it may
not be the worst I’ve ever seen, but I can’t
remember the one that was just as dull and ,
desultory and hopeless, and that looked so
much like just running on because it couldn’t
stop. There may be some useful purpose
to be served in blatantly cracking up this
disorderly Paddy’s market, but it occurs to
me that anyone wishing the A.N.A. really
well would advise the Association that it
can’t expect to score permanently by . doing
things in its sleep.

“Three Stripes”: Up near Euroa, in the
Kelly country, drowses the little Church of
England wherein the residents of Longwood
(population 800) sleep on Sundays. Thirty
of the congregation have" volunteered, and
five of them, all baptised within the church’s
walls, have made their names famous. These
are Lieut.-Col. Leslie Maygar, who won the
V.C. in S. Africa, went through Gallipoli, and
now commands the Bth Light Horse in
Egypt; Major F. H. Tubb (V.C., Gallipoli) ;
his brother, Lieut. Frank R. Tubb (M.C.,
France) ; Major Aubrey R. L. Wiltshire
(M.C. and Croix de Guerre, France) ; and
Captain Gordon Maxfield (M.C., France),
who stood to attention on the torpedoed
Southland and to arms in the trenches of
Anzac—surely the most remarkable collec-
tion of warriors that ever came out of a
dreamy little country tabernacle in one
generation.

“Sandhurst” : Foundation Day is a pub-
lic holiday in Vic. in. honor-of the landing
of Governor Phillip in Sydney Harbor on
January 26, 1788. A more appropriate date
for celebration would have been Captain
Cook’s landing at Botany Bay on April 27,
1770. The idea of making Foundation Day
a national festival was conceived by Malachi
Cahill, a president of the A.N.A. Bendigo
branch. I pinched the idea and got the
Melbourne A.N.A. to wait upon James
Service some time in 18S8 and ask him as
Premier to proclaim the 20th of January a
public holiday. Our spokesman was the
late J. L. Purves, then leader of the Vic-
torian Bar. Field Barrett, the author of
the epigram that Australians were a moder-
ately moral people, also spoke in support
of the request. Service was sympathetic,
and it was my part to thank the Minister
before the deputation withdrew.

“Ike”: Is there a shortage of fruit back
home? If not, why are we in Egypt get-
ting jam from Uncle Sham? Last week we
opened a consignment the tins of which were
quite three-parts full, and some Billjims
had to go short. Still, that wasn’t much of
a hardship considering the kind of jam it
was.
“Wyndoyle”: The champion Billjim bluff
was worked in the days when "Kitchener
cheques” were plentiful. A party of seven
boarded the Melbourne express at Sydney
with tickets for six and promptly held a
council of war to decide how to pass the
seventh. The leader (a Oft., corporal)
took charge of the orphan and at “Show
tickets, please!” he explained to the collec-
tor that the other cow was a prisoner he
was escorting to Melbourne, where a court-
martial was awaiting him for deserting from
the Victorian forces and enlisting in N.S.W.
under another name. During this critical
period the prisoner wore handcuffs for
dramatic effect. The bluffers were streaming
out of Spencer-street station when I last
saw them, so I guess they battled through
all right.
“Doggie” : When the first batch of volun-
teers from the Postmaster-General's depart-
ment was about to leave for the Front I
had the pleasure of hearing the boss in his
farewell speech tell them that on their re-
turn “they would find their jobs waiting for
them.” Well, I know four who have re-
turned, and this is what has happened to
them: —■
No. 1 was a permanent employee who was unfit
for further active military service but desired to
act as recruiting sergeant (at a lower remuneration
than his departmental pay). The necessary leave
was refused, and, determined to do his best for his
country, he resigned.
No. 2 was a "t< mporary” employee. lie had
received a life-1 ng irj ry. On reporting for duty
he was told that he world have to take his chance
in the same manner as a new applicant. He sought
work elsewhere.
No. 3 was a prrr.o'crt officer who was invalided
home owing to a breakdown of health. Immediately
on resuming .duty he was transferred to a district
with one of the most trying climates in the Common-
wealth. He had to resign.
No. i was a lad who had to get out of the
trenches owing to, heart trouble. He was given
such heavy work in the mail branch that he had to
quit it.
After this fine bit of recruiting, no wonder
the men in this department rush to enlist!

And all the sleepy living- things
Adrift above on moveless wings
Rejoice.

I hear her sing !
Each dreaming- leaf drops pearls of song,
And all the tranced sky along
In vapor caves on cloudy wreck
Of snow-capped hills the perfect ech-

Like fading perfume of a rose
The magic goes.
I hear her song!
I might have slept, but every note
From that full, alabaster throat
Breathes Wondrous love to me; and so
I drink in all its poisoned bow.
How long?
What tender light—Jehoshaphat!
It is the cat! -

“Brassard’s” yarn of duplicity :
It is recorded that an eminent military authority
once said, “Give the Australians £4O each, place
Berlin out of bounds and they will be there within
a fortnight.” Well, they’d have a good try for it.
Billeted within a few miles of a large city, our
crowd naturally desired to see the sights, but a
guard blocked the way. That set us thinking. When
we’d finished about 20 of the boys proceeded to
within 'a hundred yards of the barrier, where they
were hidden by a turn in the road. One of the
party had commandeered an officer’s cap and water-
proof cape into which he poked himself, and the
“company” fell in, formed fours and marched.
“Haiti” came the voice of the Tommy guard.
“Passes, please!” “Australian picket—no passes
required,” came the ready answer of the “0.C.”
“Quick march!” and the “picket” went on its way
to the fleshpots. After the noble band had dis-
appeared a solitary Anzac managed to get on the
right side of Atkins. “Bo careful,” was the parting-
advice of that warrior. “One of your pickets has
just gone through.”

“P.X.”: Mothers (and fathers, too) with
soldier boys at tlie Front have solid ground
for complaint against the Postal Depart-
ment. There may be some reason why Bill-
jim, whose whereabouts are more or less
uncertain, should not get letters till they
have ripened for 10 or 12 months ; but there
is no reason why the Expeditionary mail
should be the last to be delivered in Aus-
tralia. A mail arrived in Sydney week
before last. On Friday morning I received
a letter or two from London. On Saturday
some newspapers dropped in and a printed
appeal from Mrs. Lloyd George for help for
sailors’ wives. Monday morning’s mail
included a London publisher’s circular and a
service card from France. On Monday
afternoon an anxiously-awaited line or two
arrived from a soldier-son who, at previous
advices, was. at the point of death. That
was 31 days after the first letters by the
same mail were delivered, and three days
after printed matter had been made avail-
able. Similar things have happened again
and again. Repeatedly the vessel which has
brought the mail has crawled round to Syd-
ney and berthed at Circular Quay before
the Expeditionary letters landed at Adelaide
and sent overland have been delivered in the
city. These small things count.. I don’t
know whether, among the whole boiling of
Commonwealth Ministers, there is one with
SELF-RELIANT.
MRS. LEVI: “Vot do you Unit, ma tear—

but he told ’em he preferred supplyin ’
his own illuminations!”
a son at the Front. If there is, he might
tell his colleague Webster that this sort of
thing doesn’t help voluntary recruiting.
When the anxiously awaited and avidly-read
correspondence of the soldier-son is crowded
into the background by the begging circular
and the publisher’s catalogue, the least
human of us are liable to find our enthusi-
asm as recruiters at a pretty low ebb for
the time being.
From The Bulletin’s bird on the West-
ern Front: —
Winter is settling in now, and with it an
easier if more monotonous time for us. During the
summer, when it was light at 3 o’clock ancl not
dark until nine, we did five and sometimes six hours
a day in the air. It doesn’t look much on paper;
but at the end of it you feel as though you have
earned your 255.
Outside it is a typical late-November day, cold,
damp, raw, with a thick mist which puts flying
out of the programme. It has been like this for
THE BREED.
“Yes! I suppose it's the old Viking Hood in
me! But I couldn’t be out of it any
longer, so I went up yesterday and
signed on for the Army Bay Corps.”
nearly a week; so, the machines having been closely
looked over and made ready for flying, we have prac-
tically nothing to do but keep ourselves as fit as
we have got our mounts. That’s the compensation
of the Flying Corps. When you are on the job
you certainly are on the job; but when the job is
done you get what the poor beggars in the trenches
can’t have—absolute rest in comfortable quarters
away from the hellish shell-fire and everything.
The perfection to which flying has been brought
is one of the great marvels of the war. The whole
corps can spend a hundred hours in the air without
a single crash that can be attributed to a fault of
the machine. Of our actual work one can say little:
every month, to keep us reminded of our frailties,
we must accept an order committing ourselves to
all sorts of penalties for disclosing information of
military value. But most of us have rough diaries:
and there should be some talking afterwards. I
should not care to risk a bean, though, that my
diary will be any use to me for 18 months.
“Archie” is our chiefest worry. He is the Huns’
anti-aircraft gun. Their own machines are nowa-
days very rarely seen, even when the weather is
all that it should be. Nine times out of 10, when
they do come out and there is the possibility of a
scrap, they beetle off. But, to do the beggars
justice, “Archie” is magnificent; and so are
“Archie’s” gunners—as they ought to be, considering
the practice they get. Our own fellows have only
one or two shoots a week. I have had the planes
of my machine renewed twice, thanks to “Archie,”
but have had better luck myself. It isn’t one-
sided, however; for if the Hun airman won’t let
us fight him, we can direct our artillery fire and
have some play with bombs. One gets some price-
less sights in bomb-dropping. The other day, in
a raid on a railway station, I played on an engine;
and there was nothing left but steam and splinters.
Perhaps it isn’t quite the thing to talk of the
moral effect that your own crowd’s work has on
others. But chaps in the trenches have told me of
how it, has hearteqed them to see our machines
going over the Hun lines day after day in great
formations, spying out the land, noting every move-
ment, and giving them who merely walk on the
earth tho confident assurance that no great surprise
can be sprung upon them.
* * * *
“Nulla”:—•
Hard luck? ’Struth! It was Crismus in Egypt,
and though Jim and me had fed well we could ha’
done with a lot more to drink if we’d had the
dough. Moochin’ about on the off-chance of striking
someone we knew, we lobbed at a camp just when
they was handing out Crismus billies. We got one.
’Struth! It had toothbrushes, ’n’ soap, cards, a
prayer-book, and bottles of pills an’ a plum pudding.
We couldn’t look at tucker, so we give the pudding
to a nigger—poor cow, he looked hungry—an’ at the
bottom of the billy we gets a letter. It was from
three good sports of girls in Bunbury, an’ after
wishing us everything of the best, they wind up:
And we hope you won’t break your teeth on the
half-sovereign in the pudding.”
“Billjack”: Dick was hit at the same
time as me. I wasn’t all out, and I. just
gave myself up to the comfort of lying still,
but it had made a mess of Dick. I watched
him for a time, thinking he had gone over,
but presently he began pulling himself
together. I'c was a hard job, but he got
as far up as his knees; then, all shaking,
he raised his hands, and I heard him say
his prayer: “Oh, God, it’s no use talkin’ —
You knoiv!”
* * * *
“Tommy Kangaroo”: The order about
third-class carriages for the boys was bad
enough, but it’s the limit the way staff offi-
cers are treating our nursing sisters in Egypt.
They are hedged in with such ridiculous and
pin-pricking restrictions and regulations that
it’s a marvel there isn’t open mutiny. It
really seems that every-
thing is done to aggra-
vate and annoy the
nurses, while nothing is
done to make their duty
nleasant. If allowed out
in the evening they must
not leave before 8 p.m.,
and must be in by 10
p.m. excent when a late
pass is given as an extra-
special flavor. They are
not allowed to dance. Oh,
dear, no! Everybody else
may dance in Cairo, but
not the girls who are
slaving so unselfishly for
the soldiers. They must
not talk to the Billjim
hospital orderlies, or go
out with anyone less than
an officer. Recently an
order was issued forbid-
ding them to have dinner
in Cairo with Australian
officers, hut there was
such an outcry from the
officers that the order
was rescinded. There’s
not enough ink in this battalion to tell you
all the “thou slialt nots” that confront
Billjimiina here.
* * * •
“Rio”: Something for the superstitious
told by Captain Lindsay Browne, M. 0., the
Sydney boy who fought with the Irish
Rifles in France. The evening before leaving
Ireland for the Front, Browne, while walk-
ing with the R.C. chaplain, picked up a
rosary. He offered it to the Padre, saying,
“Here, Father, you’d better take this; it
probably belongs to one of your flock.” But
his Rivirence refused, saying, “No, my son;
finding that is a good omen. Put it in your
pocket and no harm will come to you in
battle.” So Browne pouched it. He went
through the hottest of the fighting of 1914,
staying with his battalion while it dwindled
from a thousand to under a hundred and
all other officers but himself were hit. lie
had three bullets through his cap, eight
through his coat and others through his
breeches. The heel was blown off his boot
by a piece of shell and several times
weapons were blown out of his hand. On
other occasions he was bespattered by the
blood of men who were fighting alongside
him. Although he suffered from strain and
shock the Germans never even drew blood
on him. And Browne is “Church of Eng-
land !”

“The Oldest Inhabitant”: A property,
offered for sale by auction on the Blue Moun-
tains a few days ago, was advertised as an
“early selection made by the late Henry
Parkes,” and within four minutes’ walk of
the Wentworth Falls railway station.” Also,
on March 24 will be offered, likewise in the
Allen estate, “Faulconbridge, Henry Parkes’s
early selection,” etc. When Henry Parkes
assigned his estate on October 12, 1887, for
the benefit of his creditors, the following
were amongst the items: —
Trustees of the late Geo. Wiaram Allen, secured
upon the Faulconbridge estate, £9344.
The City Bank, secured upon property at Faulcon-
bridge, Coleridge, Ashfield and Wentworth Falls,
£6371 18s. 3d.
City Bank, arrears of interest on same, £5OOO.
The Colonial Mutual Life Association and nine
private individuals, including Francis Abigail,
£14,000, secured upon property on North Shore;
and as to the Colonial Mutual Life, 10 shares in
the Holt-Sutherland estate.
Bank of New South Wales, £4045 os. 9d., secured
on land at Jervis Bay.
E., S. and A. C. Bank, secured upon property at
Guildford, Moama and Canley Valo, £2464 12s. 2d.
Saul Samuel and John Frazer, secured upon pro-
perty at Coleridge and Jerilderie, £2214 4s. Id.
Commercial Banking Co., secured on property at
Springwood, £lO5O.
S. Fawkes £5OO, and estate of the late John
Cuthbert, £5OO, secured upon property at the
Valley and 50 acres at Springwood.
Not one of the Mountain properties was
worth anything approaching the amount that
the old man had succeeded in borrowing upon
it. Faulconbridge and Wentworth Falls,
were merely selections on the then usual
terms of fl per acre, with residence condi-
tions. When the wonderful financier assigned
his estate he was Colonial Secretary. He
vacated his seat, but-not his office, and was
re-elected a week later.

—STRENGTH —
AND HOW TO GAIN IT.
INSTEAD OF EXERCISES, PATENT
FOODS AND MEDICINES, TAKE
PHOSPHATE WITH YOUR MEALS.
The demand to-day is for men and women
who are strong in every sense of the word
—possessing the physical strength necessary
to endure hardships and fatigue; the mental
strength to grapple with difficult problems;
the nervous force which endows the body
with vigor and vitality ; the will power to
triumph over adversity and turn defeat into
victory. But such glorious strength is im-
possible' so long as your nerves are weak
and exhausted; and therefore if you would
be really strong you must first care for your
nerves. Weak, exhausted nerves need food, and
it has been proved in numberless cases that
the only food element they can or will absorb
readily and naturally is phosphate in the
well-known form of bitro-phosphate, which
most chemists stock in 5-gr. compressed tab-
lets, so that if you feel your strength is fail-
ing from any cause, you should get a supply
of these bitro-phospliate tablets and take one
with every meal. Practically all of the
minor ailments afflicting mankind, as well
as many of the more serious maladies, can be
traced to nervous exhaustion and lowered
vitality, and probably this explains why such
a remarkable improvement in the general
health is invariably noticeable when bitro-
phosphate is taken as directed, and the
nerves are thereby revitalised and made
strong.— Advt.

Taking his second chance, Lieut.-colonel
Simpson, once a teacher at the Albury
Grammar School, was killed in France last
month. Early in the war Simpson, then 31,
left cricket and football to lesser men, said
good-bye to his wife and son, and went out
as captain in the 13th Battalion. His bri-
gade (the 4th) followed up the exploits of
the 3rd at the landing by advancing on Sari
Bair, so gallantly woft and lost at the time
the Suvla Bay effort failed. He won the
Military Cross at Gaba Tepe for directing
his battalion through unreconnoitred scrub
singing with Turkish bullets and alive with
snipers. Wounded, he was invalided home,
and the Albury people made him a presen-
tation. But he felt that his job was not yet
done, and early in May, 1916, he joined the
33rd as major. With fresh fighting came
further promotion, and he was temporary
lieut.-colonel of another N. S. Wales battal-
ion when the end came.
THE MENU.
HE ( with the breakfast liver): “Eggs, eggs,
nothing but eggs! And this one's
rotten! What have you got for dinner
to-night—eggs?"
SHE ( stinging with resentment): “Rats!”
HE : “ Then you had better cook only one. I
shan't be home!"
It was Archbishop Dunne, the gentle old
prelate of Brisbane who died the other day,
who first suggested that Cardinal Moran
(then Bishop Moran) should be appointed
to Sydney. They had been fellow-students
in Rome, and in the course of time Dr.
Dunne had come to an Australian bishopric
at Brisbane, while his friend had gone to
O.ssory, in Ireland. At the meeting of the
bishops when the Archdiocese of Sydney
became vacant on the death of Dr. Vaughan,
Bishop Dunne recommended that the name
of the Bishop of Ossory be sent to the Pope.
“You will never get him to come out here!”
he was told; but he insisted, the name was
sent and the choice was ratified by Leo XIII.
The N. S. Wales Government missed a
chance the other day. It wanted two men
for Arbitration Court Judges, and it might
have made good with Billjim by offering
one of the jobs to Dr. Brissenden, who is
now at the Front, for which he left as a
private. He was a good man when he left,
and he will be a still better man for the
very human Industrial Court when he comes
back. For a while “Bris,” the readiest wit
of the N. S. Wales Bar. was kept back at
the base, supnlying law for a corporal’s pay.
But he pushed and pushed till they let him
out and into the trenches.
Peace to William Ruka, of Rarotonga.
Trained at Auckland for war by the Maori-
land Government, the islander got as far
as Sydney with his smart little detachment,
and then had to be left behind at the Coast
Hospital. He died last week among kindly
strangers who could not speak his language,
and if any Australian wants to help put a
headstone above him, a small sub. sent to
the Maoriland Soldiers’ Reception Society,
5 Moore-street, Sydney, will be welcomed.
James Clarke, a grandfather, of Bendigo,
received a note from his son, Sergeant
Sydney Clarke, saying, “I have voted for
conscription, and I hope you and mother
did too. For God’s sake send along some
men—they’re wanted badly enough.”
Grandpa, who was a chauffeur for six years
to Captain G. Y. Lansell, now at the
Front, and recently wounded, determined to
set the boys an example. His other sons
are too young to join the colors, so he went
himself to the recruiting office, was accepted,
and was in camp when The Bulletin
heard the story.
“C.M.”: This is the youngest Billzac —■
Bertie Dunncliff, of Pirie-street, Adelaide,
No. 3735. He is not 15, yet he has been in
the trenches since November, 1915. He was
13 years 4§ months when he enlisted, had
his 14th birthday on the battlefield, and is
now returning to Australia suffering from a
nervous breakdown. His father was killed
at Gallipoli.
N.S.W. Bench has a row of very grey
wigs waiting for Time to call the last case-
Simpson (Chief Judge in Equity), <4;
Rogers, District Court, 76; Docker ("Little
Brown Jug”), 75 presently; Fitzhardmge,
71 • and Heydon, President of the Industrial
Court, three months less than that.
Pickburn and Rolin, the two newly-appointed
Industrial Judges, seem like intrusive small
boys alongside their ancient brothers-in-law.
Yet Rolin is 53. Brother Pickburn is 46.
Admiral 11. C. Kane, who died in London
lately, was the captain of the Calliope when
in 1889 a terrific hurricane tore into Apia
Harbor. Samoa, where seven warships lay.
Kane, full of courage and confidence in his
ship and his seamanship, cut his anchor,
steamed into the hell-sea, and rode it out in
safety. The U.S.A. navy lost three ships
and 104 men that day. and the German
shortage was two ships and 96 men. All
Kane got from the Lords of the Admiralty
was their “official thanks.” If a German
could have “bluffed the eternal sea” like
the English seaman did he’d have been given
a cargo of iron crosses and invited to wallow
in the Imperial sauerkraut trough any time
he was passing.
What an interesting list it would make
if somebody found out the former profes-
sions of the Bungs of Australia! Campion,
of the Swanston-street Queen’s Arms
(Melb.), who died the other day, was an
engineer before family interests called him
to the bar; and his friend Kerr, of the Port
Phillip Club, who died a few days later, was
an architect who took to butter-making,
established the first factory in the Western
District, and afterwards helped to build
scores of them throughout Australia. /
A salute of 19 guns should be arranged
for Mrs. A. A. Leane, of Prospect (S.A.)
in part recognition of what she has done for
her country. Until January 4, when one of
them, Alan W., was killed in action, she
was the mother of three lieut.-colonels- -
Edmund Thomas, on the 2nd Divisional
Administrative Staff, who was a captain in
Gallipoli with the 12th Battalion, of Lone-
some Pine fame; Raymond Lionel, who, also
as a captain in Gallipoli, took Leane’s
Trench with a bunch of the 11th Battalion,
won the Military Cross thereby, and later
gained the D.S.O. in France; and Alan W.
aforementioned. The last-named was officer
commanding the 28th Battalion, whirl he
joined as major and company-commandar in
April, 1915. Mrs. Leane’s two remaining
sons—B.B. and E.A. —are a major and a
sergeant respectively. The major jumped
from chevron to stars when he was pro-
moted from the ranks the day after the
Landing. In addition to the first generation
four grandsons and six nephews are helping
to make the Kaiser realise that he spoke out
of his turn. If this be not enough, Lieu-
tenant T. C. Fairley, of the 4Sth Battalion,
who won the Military Cross at Pozieres for
line-repairing under fire, is an adopted son
of Mrs. Leane’s daughter, Mrs. W. Taylor,
of Kalgoorlie.
ri.S.” : Hughes has many of the instincts
of the hermit. There are few men in Aus-
tralia who are seen about less, and they- are
mostly in gaol. In fact, Hughes can put up
with his kind only in the mass; individually
he shows an aversion to man that amounts
almost to a mania.- He is accused of having
formed a cave in the Labor party. If he has
he will certainly live alone in it.
TOO RISKY ALTOGETHER.
BILLJIM : “My oath, Henry, I wouldn't like
to he invalided home. Think of the
danger of them blinkin' submarines.”
Passed back into the crucible at 65, T. U.
Walton, chief chemist to the Colonial Sugar
Refining Co. He came out from Greenock
(Scotland) 36 years ago, and he and his
sweet job held each other firmly till Death
stepped in last week. Local scientists lis-
tened to him with deference, and the Sydney
branch of the Society of Chemical Industry
was pioud to call him its lion. sec. lie was
just the sort of man Australia can’t afford
to lose.
EXPLAINED AT LAST.
POPSYWOPSY : “What’s it feel like to be
under fire? Isn't it positively too
thrilling for words?”
ANZAC ( after searching hard for a suffi-
ciently explanatory illustration) : “Well.
Miss, for a woman I s’pose it'd be like
havin’ a mouse run up yer leg.”
Thirty-six years ago 11. W. Cameron won
the champion-baby prize at Tamworth
(N.S.W.) : a week ago one of his children
won the “finest baby under 12 months” prize
on the same showground.
“F.L.J.”: As tlie Carmelite priests go
everywhere to preach missions. Father Ley-
bourne and Father Devlin will be remem-
bered all over the Australian continent.
They came from and went back to an inter-
esting old church in Whitefriar-street, Dub-
lin, which is bound up with the modern
history of the old city by the Liffey.
Father Leybourne died since his return
to Dublin, and he has been succeeded as
head of the “Children of Mary” by Father
Devlin, who, like him, used to flourish at
Port Melbourne. The “Children” have been
celebrating their silver jubilee, and Father
Devlin took occasion to talk of Australia.
The Dublin “Children” are more liberal
than the Australian ones, by the way. They
admit married women to membership.
“The Life of E. W. Cole,” the venerable
Book Arcadian, just, published, is by “One
Who Knows Him Well”; and the one is
supposed to be Pyke, his manager. It is
doubtful whether the column of type in the
“boneyard” of more than one Melbourne
newspaper, prepared some time ago when
the good old boy was ill, contains more in-
teresting details. The Book King, says his
biographer, landed here in the sixties, after
two years in S’Africa. With a frying-pan
as a signboard, he sold cordials to the Mary-
borough (Vic.) diggers, but in the ’seven-
ties drifted to Melbourne and at a bookstall
in Paddy’s Market laid the foundation of a
business which has spread over three cities
and runs to almost everything except trac-
tion-engines ' and giraffes.
Captain William Richard Benton, of the
Manchester Regiment, killed in action at
the Somme, crowded plenty into his 40
years.. Starting as clerk to his father, a
London stockbroker, he skipped from the
office and enlisted as private in the “blue
marines.” While on the Australian station
he deserted from the Orlando, then flagship
at Sydney, and got up country to Cowra,
where he worked as a farm-hand. He went
into an Australian contingent to the
S’African disturbance, and then joined the
Cape Police. In the force he “got religion.’
and going to England to be trained for the
Anglican priesthood, conscience made him
give himself up at Portsmouth as a deserter
from the R.M.A. He was court-martialled
and served a sentence, afterwards going
through liis course at an Anglican seminary
and becoming ordained. Returning to
S’Africa, he expounded the Word for some
time to the lepers on Robben Island. When
war broke out he got a military chaplaincy
in Flanders, but the Hun frightfulness made
him doff his dog-collar and look for a job
in which he could hit back. His _ former
training secured him a commission as
lieutenant, and he had got his three stars
when the Last Post sounded.
EVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
• Further exemption has been refused to a designer
of a firm of West End drapers, who was to have been
sent to Paris to select Spring fashions. The tribunal
said that fashions were now unnecessary. Changes
were not desired for three years.- —Cable item.
Since first a fig-leaf fluttered free
By rivers dim of Paradise,
Eve’s flashing eyes were wide to sec
The cut and shape of some device
Her shapely form to featly dress
And emphasise its loveliness.
Fresh fashions with the turning years
Made dazzling pageant as she went.
The work of needle, loom and shears
To subtle fantasy was lent.
In numerous garments, or in few,
Eve smiled because the style was new.
About six thousands years or so
Tlie dress conventions were her care,
Till war’s wild horns began to blow
A louder call to earth and air—
No previous red commands to slay
Had changed the tenor of her way.
But this war was of larger make.
It held the whole round earth in thrall.
The tottering thrones were seen to shake,
The steadfast mountains seemed to fall;
And word went forth “all fashions cease
Till fire and sword have won us peace.”
The newer modes were wrought in steel,
The latest styles were fringed with fire;
And Fate stood cloaked from throat to heel
In poison fumes and murder-wire.
The awful fashions of the hour
Were lightnings linked to death and power.
What mattered young Felicia’s dress,
Tube skirt or billowing petticoat,
The robe that sat like a caress,
The scarf on summer winds afloat?
The manj'-colored fashion-plate
Was absolutely out-of-date.
Eve, in her daughters, laughed aloud.
The fancy of the time went free.
None to a set convention bowed
While khaki held the world in fee;
But every damsel, happy faced,
Brought up her own reserves of taste.
All colors, every style and shape,
Were setting for her laughter clear ;
And soft alluring things to drape
Her sweetness filled the changing year—
Men saw, the storms of war o’erblown,
The best-dressed world that they had known!
N.S.W.

The profit is better than any disclosed since
the end of 1914—foolish days when the
press was instructed in plain words to pull
the public’s leg, and the deluded hanks, in
common with others, believed that the war
would be all over in a few weeks. Last
year, on discovering how wickedly it had
been misled, the Victoria was feeling pretty
bad about it, and its figures suffered in conse-
quence. Now, the world seems a bit
brighter, so the profit looks up again.
From this it may be judged that
not much importance can be attached
to these figures in such times. Ordinarily
a bank can no more than indicate the trend
of its profits. But in disturbed times like
these there is no settled trend. One banker,
taking a gloomy view, may regard it as
necessary to make very large provisions
against probable future losses ; and he will
bite out of present apparent profits large
sums to cover these contingencies. Actu-
ally nobody knows what is going to happen.
But if banks can escape losses of principal,
they ought to show good profits for sofne
years to come, assuming, of course, that
there is no national catastrophe ahead of us.
As to losses of principal, what are the
prosnects V Such losses are generally due
-—in Australia particularly —to forced real-
isations. The creditor won’t wait for the
recovery. There is no reason to expect early
trouble from this source, because nowadays,
so far as the banks are concerned, we are
mostly our own creditor. But that won’t
necessarily save the banks from temporary
inconvenience. Because nobody knows what
our staple products are going to bring,
nobody knows what our land and
other securities are going to be worth.
Nobody knows either what their ex-
change business is going to be worth to
the banks; for that depends largely on
prices, too. The future is theretore un-
certain. But, assuming fair prices for
wool, wheat, meat and metals, bank profits
should be good. Interest is not going to
be low for years ; and, apart from the earn-
ings on their own funds, it is easier for a
bank to make profits when money is dear
than when it is cheap—especially when the
banks are a happy family as they are in
Australia.
The Victoria has a small, heavily-gilded
backing in the State to which it is confined ;
and its deposits at interest are much larger
in proportion to other deposits than is the
case with most banks. For that reason it
is justified in working on smaller liquid assets
than most banks. Still, even allowing for
that circumstance, 28 p.c. is a small holding
of liquid assets. The wheat harvest is,
however, coming in, and the wool-clip has
been sold ; so the advances will probably be
reduced, and the cash position strengthened.
That will bring the figures to something
more like what they were. Here is a com-
parison of the present with a year ago and
the December prior to the war: —

Capital and reserves combined are
£1,918,125. Total liabilities (deposits, etc.)
are £6,049,825. So the Victoria owes less
than £3 10s. for every £1 of its own in the
business ; and that gives the creditor extra-
good security.
Apropos the Victoria and another, an old
banker writes: —
The recent amalgamation of two small Queensland
banks suggests the amalgamation of two nearly-pure
Victorian institutions —the Victoria and Colonial.
Both do business on the same lines in the same
limited sphere. The original charters of both were
opposed By the British banks and their operations
were limited. Each has< a London office and the
Colonial has one in Sydney. The Victoria cannot
open in the other States. If a fusion were effected,
there is no reason why a Federal Act should not be
passed giving the new concern the right to open in
the other States. The Victoria has 98 branches
and agencies; the Colonial 107. Of these 32 offices
are open in the same towns and would be closed,
leaving 173 branches and agencies, which seems
plenty for one State. The union of the staffs would
permit of some of the very old managers being
pensioned off. The savings effected by shutting up
the 32 offices would enable the Board to raise
salaries to a considerable extent all round. That
would be most desirable, because the two banks do
not pay their employees nearly scf liberally as some
of their rivals pay theirs. And the coalition should
earn increased profits, while the resources of the
new institution would be materially strengthened.
There would be a lot of the banks’ own real estate
available for sale to go to the credit of the joint
reserve fund. The united_.capi±al_Xif. nearly two
millions would be ample fox prudent ...extension of
the business. The adjustment of the share capital
interests ought not to be difficult on the basis of
fully-paid-up £1 shares. No new issue of capital
would be- necessary. With ten millions sterling of
deposits and advances and 3-1 millions of liquid assets,
the new concern would step into the front rank of
Australian banks and ruffle for new business with
the best of them. The Commonwealth Bank in the
near future, having neither dividends nor share-
holders to consider, will make the earning of banking
profits by little joint-stock banks not quite so easy
as it has been in the past; and increased taxation
will add to the difficulties. If they are wise they
will economise where they can.

In saying good-bye to general-manager Hen-
derson, who has just retired, it was recalled
“with pride” that the City was one of the
very few banks which did not shut IfieTr doors
in the crisis of the ’9o’s. Well, Mr. Hender-
son may be proud of it.; but he might have
hath a lot more sleep in subsequent years if
the bank had made a clean breast of its diffi-
culties then and used the axe and the broom
as others did. Instead, though a great deal
of capital was lost, the bank went on pre-
tending that it still had its £400,000 intact;
and for many years it has struggled to pay
a dividend on the full amount. If it only
had £300,000 (and there was a time when it
probably couldn’t show that much), then a
4 p.c. dividend was really a 5| p.c. dividend
on its actual capital. And even 5J p.c. looks
better than 4 p.c. The poorness of the divi-
dend and the public’s uncertainty as to the
bank’s position must have been a severe
handicap; and thus it has probably taken
twice as long to restore the lost capital as it
would have done if the assets had been
written down openly and capital reduced
accordingly. However, the City has always
had a little group of good friends; and. even
though the market value of the shares is
still much below par, the general manager
probably leaves his old chair knowing that,
on a fair valuation, there are now enough
assets in excess of liabilities to represent the
full capital. It will be for the new general
manager (J. S. Marks, lately secretary and
head-office manager) to persuade the public
that that is so. This done, an increase of
the visible profits and the dividend will
follow. ’
The next table shows how the business
compares with that o'f a year apd 10 years
ago:—

record; and the improvement in the ad-
vances is no doubt better than the figuies
suggest, because there should be now less
dead-wood in the pile. Total liabilities
are £2.130.194. Deduct the liquid assets,
£572,499, and there remains £1,557,695 of
debt, represented by £1,820,095 of bills and
advances and £193,740 of premises. The
unknown quantity is the proportion Of doubt-
ful assets (if any) among the bills and
advances, But, as said, just nbw, it is
doubtful Whether there is much Over-valued
stuff left On the books. At any rate, the
disclosed profit nowadays is well over 7 p.c.
on the capital, and that, the chairman
assures the shareholders, is after placing a
very large sum” to contingency account.
Assuming that the £400,000 capital is now
intact the liabilities are equal to about £5 6s.
of the shareholders’ money in the business
(apart from reserves of all kinds) ; and that
isn’t by any means the limit of safe trading
when a bank has the confidence of its
depositors.

Here is another case in which the share-
holders might very properly be invited by
director Irvine and director Donald Mac-
kinnon to put up at least £50,000 of new
capital for investment in a War Loan.
Even including the undivided profits just
transferred to capital, the total is only
£50,000, which leaves £200,000 uncalled.
Apart from every other consideration, a 14
p.c. dividend does not look well; and for
prudential reasons alone the co. ought to
j lira at a chance of reducing it. If share-
holders put up £50,000 for a war loan, the
dividend could be reduced to a less con-
spicuous p.c., and still the shareholders
would get the full amount of the present
dividend plus the full interest on the loan.
Moreover, there is no doubt that a good
many of these cos. ought to put up more
capital. This co. doesn’t say the value of
the estates in its hands; but the total must
have increased very much in recent years,
and the capital should have increased in
proportion. If there was no need for it —If,
in other words, there are no risks to cover —
then there is no justification for the present
charges.
The co., while paying a dividend varying
from 10 to 30 p.c., has accumulated assets in
this fashion :—•

of the lots look over-valued.

Of course no co. which supplies a public
necessary, and especially an article upon
which hundreds of other industries more or
less depend, ought to pay a 13 p.c. dividend.
There can be no worse enemy not only of
private enterprise but of Australian enter-
prise than a light and power co. which uses
its monopoly to make profits of that sort.
How can the Australian industry which
needs these things compete decently with,
say, ftn English industry which can buy
municipally-supplied gas for less than two
shillings, largely becahse the capital in the
Undertaking is paying only 34 or 4 p.c.?
Cds: of this sort have been sheltering behind
the barrier erected against the socialistic
attacks on Private Enterprise. But we
have got to begin to take such matters more
seriously. National existence simply demands
that our industries shall not suffer
handicaps from which those of other coun-
tries are free. Such considerations intro-
duce an element of uncertainty to invest-
ments of this kind. Probably no injustice
will be done to them. Even though they be
sharks, none of the teeth which they now
have will be drawn. But it seems likely
that they will not be allowed to grow any
more teeth.
Still, the rate of dividend is really hot as
bad as it looks. For note the premium which
has been paid on shares. The share capital
is £957,2i0. Add to that the premium capi-
tal and the total is £1,515,540; and On that
lot the present dividend is a shade under 8i
p.c, But the co. has made very large sums
which it has not divided, and it is still
making them. Look at this comparison !

Total Outlay charged to capital £2,171,745 £2,472,540
Total revenue . . . . 202,400 446,163
Revenue p.c. of capital outlay: 9.3 p.c. 18.0 p.fc.
Thus the revenue ih the 10 years has id-
creased by £243,731; and to produce that
result the shareholders have supplied only
£300,795 more capital. How much the cus-
tomers have supplied can’t be told for cer-
tain ; but look at the table, and you will see
that during the past five years £315,510 of
profit has been put into works —that is to
say, into “extension and improvement of
plant.” That is exclusive of the revenue
that has been employed in repairs and re-
newals. Last half-year, for instance, £07,141
was spent on repairs, maintenance and re-
newal of works and plant, including mains ;
and another £12,500 or more went in repair-
ing meters and stoves. The average profit
put into additions and improvements was
thus £63,000 a year, which is equal to 44
p.c. p.a. on the mean of the capital and pre-
mium capital combined during that period.
Thus, if the dividend is only 8* p.c. on the
capital actually put into the business by
shareholders, the transfer of profit to capital
account brings the total to 12J p.c.; and
there is, in addition, the Unappropriated pro-
fit put to reserve. Ohe of our national pro-
blems is how to obtain cheap light and power
for our industries; and cheaper lighting
also means a ioWer cost of living, which
makes lower wages possible without decreas-
ing the value of the wages. We must begin
to ioOk at these matters now from the
national point of view; and a change must
be made here.

That steady shrinkage of profits doesn’t iook
good, especially as the risks haven’t been
shrinking too —in volume anyway. So far
as the past year is concerned part of the
slump is due to extra land and income tax
payments; but not much, because all that
Maoriland is collecting towards the cost of
the war is still pretty harmless. Any real
struggle to pay the bill is being evaded in
the most cowardly fashion. Apparently the
idea is to let the men who are making the
disgustingly fat war profits have their fling,
and hand around the bill presently when the
fellows who are doing the fighting are back.
There is no more disgraceful feature of
Southern politics than the behavior of the
Maoriland politician, who, while pouring out
gallons of mushy patriotic “oratory” in Eng-
land, has been loafing on the harassed old
country for war-money and war-orders, and
has taken scarcely a step to appropriate
any of the war profits. It, of course, only
means deferring the trouble, for the bill will
have to be paid out of something else pre-
sently. This co. isn’t one of those that are
making war profits. But it is one of those
that will suffer by and bye because war pro-
fits haven’t been collared for the relief of the
community.

The directors shouldn’t have done it: they
have rushed the .dividend ahead far too
quickly. They have lodged with the
Treasurer £11,390 (face value) of Govern-
ment debentures which cost them £10,004;
and Tiie Bulletin is pretty certain that if
this stock was written down to present value
the whole £569 of reserves and a lot more
would be wiped out. The Treasurer
recently agreed with trustee cos. to pay par
for stock lodged as a guarantee, provided
they bought it at par. This co. didn’t, and
apparently has no guarantee from the
Treasurer. Anyway, here is the position:
tlm co. made an investment six years ago
which has shrunk in value more than the
amount which has been put to reserves. In
the plainest terms this means, assuming that
the Treasury investment is not guaranteed,
that the directors have paid away in divi-
dends more than the total net profits of the
co. It is a bad start for a trustee co. to
make: the management, knowing how profit-
able a trustee co. is when it gets thor-
oughly established, might ivell have exercised
some self-restraint in the matter of divi-
dends.
From one of the best-known of Australian
working prospectors:—
Whst an enormous area of auriferous country the
early diggers had the run of! Go out from Barraba
(N.S.W.), where nowadays it is all wheat and sheep
and rabbits (a very successful freezing works treat-
ing the latter), and where mining is almost a thing
of the past, and all about among the serpentine
and diorite hills yon strike flats that have been
pot-holed for alluvial; and wonderful tales are
told of some of the finds away back in the ’so’s.
At Wood’s Reef, about 12 miles off, are two old
batteries, and the remains of another. Good stuff
was crushed there, one 100-ton lot returning 800 oz.,
and the mine was worked profitably for years. The
tailings, alas, as is usual in N. S. Wales, have gone
into the creek.
Heaven only knows how much the cyaniding
industry has lost through this practice in the Ma
State. Ancient and weird batteries out Campbell's
River way, near Rockley, that were worked by
water-wheels long before copper plates were intro-
duced, and so long ago that all records have
been forgotten, similarly ran their tailings into
the nearest creek, and none remain for the cya-
nider. In Victoria, ever the more far-seeing State
in matters of gold-mining, the practice was pro-
hibited in very early days, on account of the silting
up of the watercourses; and that wise prohibition
indirectly did more to stimulate the cyanide industry
when it came along than anything else. Nowadays
anyone who runs tailings into a Victorian water-
course is speedily called to account; but in N. S.
Vales, whatever the law says, nobody takes much
notice. You can easily, if you own a. tinpot battery
in the Backblocks, run the residues on to the bank,
so that the first flood sweeps them away. Thus a
heap of tailings large enough to warrant the erec-
tion of a cyanide plant, and the consequent pro-
duction of wealth, never gets a chance to accumu-
late.
In one way it doesn’t make much difference,
because the regulations relating to tailings are so
hopelessly inadequate and out of date that in them-
selves they are sufficient to prevent such an industry
as cyaniding being established on a commercial
basis. So long as mining laws are the outcome of
the ignorance of Sydney politicians, mostly lawyers,
what can one expect, though ? But at making
laws that involve hardworking and deserving people
in unprofitable lawsuits they leave little to be
desired. It is a significant fact that when anyone
makes inquiries about a hung-up mine in N. S.
Wales he mostly finds he must go to a Sydney law-
yer. If not, then it is in the hands of some other
Sydney shark. N. S. Wales mining, outside one or
two big fields, is largely a matter of providing
sharks with suitable tucker. Yet a few dead sharks
on Bondi beach are objected to.
The Port Adelaide Dock Co. has held its
last half-yearly meeting. It was founded in
1878 (Joseph Fisher, chairman), and the
dock was opened by Premier Morgan in
1880. Only one of the seven original direc-
tors survives. The S. Aus. Government is
acquiring all docks and harbors in the State,
and has bought this one “at a price satisfac-
tory to the Government and shareholders
alike”; so the co. goes into liquidation at
once.

From Westonia:—
In the Edna May Deep Levels report to November
.30 the directors state that between 8000 and 12,000
tons of ore worth 60s. exist above 500 ft. Now,
what is meant by this? According to official reports
the show is down 480 ft., and what shareholders
would like to have is an estimate of ore reserves
above that level. The tonnage that exists between
480 ft. and 500 ft. cannot be raised by legitimate
mining operations, but only by underhand stoping or
pig-rooting. By the way, what has become of the
high values reported in Deeps bore at 443 ft. ?
According to the manager, the value of the ore at
the 480 ft. level is 605., but assays from the bore
referred to ran into ounces. The public, as a whole,
appears to have forgotten this bore, but many indi-
viduals should have good reason to remember it.
Manager Stuckey has been requested to attend the
meeting of shareholders in Melbourne in order to
explain the present position. Local-director Duff
accompanies Stuckey as a sort of escort; but neither
he nor Stuckey looks forward to this trip with
relish. It is pretty certain both will be asked ques-
tions in quite a different tone to that which greeted
them on the occasion of previous visits. No doubt
the debenture holders, who have the right to acquire
Deeps stock at 255. per share in liquidation of their
debentures, will be particularly inquisitive. Sydney
shareholders who entertained Stuckey in such good
style may also be expected to be heard from.
The demise of Edna May at the 385 ft. level is
approaching. The lode is shorter, narrower and gener-
ally not as good as at corresponding points in higher
levels. The basic dyke has settled the mine’s preten-
sions, and has not permitted Deeps to have any at all.
Edna May will continue to pay 3s. dividends for a little
while, but will shortly find itself in the position of
not having sufficient rich ore to mix with the poorer
stuff. This means reduction of monthly output, and
consequently reduction in dividends. The mine may
pay another 60s. ; beyond that, no'body should guess.
Mary Mac (W.A.) is in trouble. There
is a good treatment plant on the mine, but, as
with most of the Melbourne-run mines, devel-
opment is far behind the mill, and additional
cash is wanted to look for more ore. Local
opinion is that the show is all right, and
that capital is only needed to make it pay.
But in nine cases out of 10 local opinion
is mostly that of the pub and storekeeper.
The newly-installed battery at Mt. Bod-
dington (W.A.) has been given a trial run
and crushing is expected to be in full swing
in a week or two. Meantime efforts are
being made to work up the market.

The Queensland Government Geologist
(L. C. Ball) in 1011 figured the reserves in
Mt. Oxide at 250,000 tons, but in his report
to the Public Works Commission the quan-
tity has dwindled to 30.000 tons, value 20
p.c., plus a large quantity of lower grade.
The question to be decided is whether Mt.
Oxide can provide a train-load of ore per
day for a railway estimated to cost £400,000.
Corbould of Mt. Elliott reckons the reserves
at 95,000 tons of profitable ore, and his pre-
vious estimates about Alt:. Elliott have been
remarkably correct. But estimation of- ore
in a patchy mine is tremendously difficult;
and no better proof is needed that Alt. Oxide
is patchy than the 3241 tons of 40 p.c. ore
packed away on camels to Cloncurry or to
Normanton, on the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Mt. Cuthbert (Q.) will have its smelter
completed very shortly, so there is a lively
interest in the development of the Mighty
Atom and Kalkadoon mines, which will assist
the parent property to supply ore. Nomi-
nally the ore reserves have not increased
more than a few thousand tons since 1912,
when they were estimated at 150,000 tons
containing 12,000 tons of copper; but recent
work has disclosed ore that has good fluxing
qualities. The Kalkadoon, for instance,
has a run of high-grade ore at the 250 ft.
level for a length of 240 ft.; but the deepest
level (350 ft.) is mainly a low-grade lime-
stone formation with occasional enrichments.
The Mighty Atom has levels at 150 ft.,
250 ft. and 350 ft., but a great amount of
development remains to be done at the lower
levels. Above the 150 ft. there is a fair
quantity of 12 p.c. ore. The most recent
estimate of reserves in the various leases
owned by Mt. Cuthbert is 158.000 tons, con-
taining 12,300 tons of copper. The works
are expected to produce 350 tons of blister
copper per month.
Mammoth Copper (Q.) has been sending
small quantities of picked ore to southern
smelters, but the Board has determined to
sink deeper and do more development work.
Mammoth’s trouble is the high cost of Coke
from N. S. AVales and freight on shipments
of matte to Pt. Kembla. The mines are
situated more than 20 miles from the rail-
head at Alungana.
Corella, Cloncurry, was handicapped last
half-year by increased costs, as indicated by
a ne t profit of £6878 from 9184 tons ore and
509 tons copper. More than £5 worth of
metal was recovered per ton of ore, so it is
difficult to excuse a net profit averaging less
than 14s. The profit with the balance
brought into account gave the directors
£7061, which they cut up bv writing off
£648 for depreciation, providing £3OOO for
taxes and placing £3BOO to an equalisation
reserve. On October 31 the surplus of liquid
assets was £8039, which compares with
£4700 at the end of the previous half-year.
Copper products on hand or in transit were
valued at £28,000. but against this the bank
overdraft was £22,000.
Sid Plain has been ringing joybells over
Main Reef, Maindample (Vic.).* lie has
mostly handled shows with little gold, and has
become expert in chasing .after cheap costs.
But he thinks he is now training for 4oz.
results at Main Reef. Two years plugging
away at 240 ft. has opened up a length 'of
47oft. on the lode, but the shoot narrows
from 2ft. to din. Now it has pinched itself
into a 2in. formation; but as there is the
chance of another shoot of stone ahead, a bit
more prospecting is to be done. Main-
dample has a patchy reputation, hut Plain
is satisfied that the block between 240 ft. and
140 ft. will pan out well. As a side-line he
has a crosscut out for Anderson’s reef, which
ought to have sparkled up long since. As
the country has been bucked about by heavy
faulting a blank has been drawn so far,
though work has gone out 430 ft.
Ministers Livingstone and McLeod are
awake to the fact that Victoria has an asset
in brown coal, for last week they chirruped
to the effect that nothing better than Mor-
well was standing idle under the Southern
Cross. McLeod, when at the Mines Depart-
ment, didn’t realise the fact; but what has
got him apd Livingstone on the go now is
that some unnamed crowd wants to put
£200.000 or £300.000 into handling the
deposits. It wouldn’t be a nice outlook for
gas and electric-light directors if the State
went into the business of making producer
gas and churning out electricity from brown
coal. So a few people are doing a lot of sly
kicking; in fact, there is talk of an open
light for possession of Morwell. Premier
Peacock will need to take a firm stand to
resist the pressure which is being applied to
stop the State from taking control of the
latent wealth of the Morwell deposits.
John Brandon has pulled off the Misima
deal for Broken Hill Block 10, so that
he and Tom Rollason again know the ex-
citement and joys of a mining float. It
wasn’t so rare once. Brandon ought to make
a tidy bit out of the acceptance of the St.
Aignan’s claims by Block 10, and so should
Gordon Lyon and T. Birkbeck out of their
Misima syndicate which held the rest of the
leases that go to make up the new float as
approved by A. B. Ward and Clayton. Block
10 sunk over £12,000 at Misima in doing
hard mining before it took over the option,
but what Gordon Lyon spent in reconciling
the 40-odd interests in the leases can- never
figure in any balance-sheet. The story gOes
that it was like drawing teeth to get Duncan
Mcßrydc to agree that Block 10 should put
up £30,000 to get this Misima spec, going.
Lucky for him that just then he could con-
sole himself with a seat on the fat Board of
the Broken Hill Associated Smelters.
“Larraba”: Excellency Gilruth continues
to provide evidence of the advantage of
employing a horse-doctor to administer an
allotment over four times the size of the
United Kingdom. The latest concerns the
battery at Hayes’s Creek tinfield. The field
warranted a battery. Dr. Jensen urged the
erection of one, and it was decided to lop off
five head of the old Zapopan battery which
has served as a lodging-house for the Wagge-
man tribe for the past 10 years. The next
thing was to get a man to erect the outfit.
A competent mining engineer, now doing his
bit at the Front, applied for the job. He
had put up batteries all over the West, but
he was turned down. Then Oliver, Inspec-
tor of Mines, was ordered to get the battery
up somehow; and as he could not do it him-
self he had to cast around. Finally, the
foreman of the diamond-drill had the job
thrust upon him. He objected that he was
a driller, not a mining engineer; but he was
over-ruled and had to carry on. He did his
best, but the battery won’t work. Efficiency
is fatal in the N.T. Strangman, Day, Holtze,
Boyes, Tensen. Francis. Askins and now
Winters —all efficient and all fired. Isn’t it
time somebody asked something about the
firer ?
Wallaroo and Moonta shares are strong
because the accounts for 1916 are certain
to show a bumper profit. Figuring on
declared dividends of 17s. 6d. per share,
this ancient concern paid a higher rate of
interest on its issued capital than any other
big copper co. in Australia. It is difficult
to say, however, whether dividends will be
increased again to ss. per quarter. War
taxes and high mining costs make a heap
of difference. Development is a matter of
great importance, too, for while the smelter
is asking for 70,000 to 80.000 tons of 9 p.c.
ore, from ISO.OOO to 200.000 tons have to
be raised out of the mines and concentrated
up to the required grade.

A note from George Laurie, brother of
Bill, prospector of Tanami and other Far
Nor’-West fields (Bill’s death, through an
accident on the track, was reported in
Bulletin of February I)
Bill had come in from Tanami one week before
the accident and wired the Mines Department that
he had sunk a shaft 185 ft. and struck heavy water.
He had cut a four-feet lode worth one ounce to the
ton at 80ft. He opened out at 160 ft. to crosscut
tor this lode. Dr. Jensen pieked the site of the
shaft and assured a pound-for-pound subsidy. The
Director of Mines has petrol placed along the road
to Tanapii and is going out with a. jnotor-car as
soon as the wet season permits to sec if the field
warrants n treatment plant. On my last trip I
reported on a route from Blunder Bay to Tana mi
which would traverse two belts of mineral country
and cut off about 200 of the present 500 miles track
to Tanami. This route would make it profitable
to treat the 50 thousand pounds' worth of ore that
has been carefully sampled and measured on poor
old Bill’s leases. Tom Laurie is administering the
estate and will arrive in Darwin on the 16th of
this month. As for me, I’m on my way to see an
eve expert at Melbourne. 1 lost the sight of one
eye through an accident while taking out an official
to confirm mv report on some copper lodes I had found
near the head of the Negri Diver.
What a family of pioneers! And yet they
get less consideration from Australia than if
they poked around doing odd jobs in the
suburbs!
Mt. Bischoff (Tas.) continues to handle
large, quantities of gossan, porphyry and
alluvial wash dirt. The recent 2s. (id. fol-
lows a ss. dividend in June, so there is some
cause for the slackness in shares. Costs
have been up to nearly Bs. per ton, and
that is altogether too high for Bischoff, whose
crude ore is often worth only 10s.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, February 5, 1917.
My Dear Abini.—
From the landing of Captain Cook, in
which the Kindergarten abo. with the spear
is fearsomely large, to delicately-painted
vases and exquisite embroideries is more
than a penny section; yet anyone who
visited the exhibition of Public School chil-
dren’s work held at the Education Office
can trace the journey step by step. -Not
even the persistent leak of Friday morning
could damp the enthusiasm of Mr. Branch
and his band of art teachers as they sur-
veyed the result of last year’s labors.
The visitors wandered from table to
table admiring book-plates and book-covers ;
here, a beautiful frieze, there some sten-
cilled at length they could see
the young hod-carrier of the future eating
the evening meal from hand-painted china,
while the garish electric light was softened
by the latest design in lamp shades. It is
an idea with great possibilities. In the
left-hand corner of the outer room there
Avas a touching little exhibit of three speci-
mens of brush-work on black ground. These
Avere the work of three very young deaf-
and-dumb children; and that makes us
very grateful to a system that opens up the
world beautiful to these little brothers and
sisters.
What about a Girls’ Anti-shirker League
whose members shall be pledged not to flirt
with the men Avho stay at home? Recruit-
ing agents simply waste their breath while
Doris and Lurline and Babs smile upon the
shirkers and sustain them Avith persiflage.
Youth can only be really hurt by youth, and
one frozen shoulder in an organdie blouse
is more effective than a hallful of male
eloquence. It’s about time the girl-shirker
heard a few home truths from her brother
at the Front.
Many waters could not quench the gaiety
at St. Vincent’s Hospital on Wednesday
evening when the nurses laid down their
thermometers and poultices and became
Pierrettes and other frivolous persons. There
Avas a feminine Charlie Chaplin, a lot of
colored lanterns, much supper and music
of various brands. Nurse Fennelly led the
dramatic forces, Nurse Hastie bjat all
comers at euchre, and Drs. Moran and Lam-
rock and Mobbs made efficient M’s.C. The
proceeds—nice plump proceeds, too, in spite
of the rain—are to go towards paying off
some liabilities on the new Nurses’ Home.
Miss IloAvsell, the tactful lady whose
remarkable gifts enabled her to live at
peace with members of the Women’s
Patriotic Club (recently defunct) for 10
years, has taken on the job of guardian
angel at the Soldiers’ Club, George-street.
She has, at last, lost count of the number
of soldiers’ socks that have clicked off her
needles.
Bertha Stock, a Maorilander with a good
voice and most flexible hands on the piano,
is among those who keep the Red Cross flag
flying in New York. The Stock lady is
more than holding her own in the musical
Avorld against all-comers under Old (and
now Very Gradual) Glory.
Last Saturday—a wild and Avatery day
—the N.S.W. teetotallers intended to ex-
cursh down Sydney Harbor and present
their champion, Archdeacon Boyce, Avith a
portrait of himself by Julian Ashton, presi-
dent of N.S.W. Society of Artists. Nobody
Avho knows the history of Julian’s duel
with the Royal Art Society will mistake
this for a weak-kneed attempt to throw
oils on troubled waters. Any oil that is
thrown from Julian’s end will be carefully
set fire to first.
Among the summer visitors who are bait-
ing their hooks with their troubles in the
Kosciusko trout-streams is Francis H. Snow,
the metal man whom Billy Hughes tried so
hard to convict of trading with the enemy.
Snow, an Adelaide man, had other anxieties,
too; for while Australia was trying to con-
vict him of helping the German, the Ger-
man was trying to “pot” his son, who is in
the Flying division. However, so far the
scoring is even, for both the Billies have
thus far missed.
Mrs. Tom Rolin, wife of the new Indus-
trial Court Judge, is a daughter of the late
Dr. Bowker. As a girl she was a raving
beauty, as the Yanks say: black hair, violet
eyes, perfect features and complexion and
uncommonly tall. She still retains many of
those enviable qualifications. The new
Judge himself had also a few looks of his
own in his day.
Mrs. Edwin Geach, senior, passed out last
week. The sudden death of her husband
through a tram accident at the Quay two
years ago was a shock from which the lov-
able old lady did not recover. The Geach
family were ever doers. Edwin, jun., is a
film magnate; Portia Geach has made a
name as an artist, and of late has been much
identified with the Child Study Association.
She and a few other girl food-reformers
have started the Natural Food Cafd in Eliza-
beth-street, where pure wheatmeal and
wholemeal in various forms will be the lead-
ing lines. Another sister (one of the early
victims of appendicitis) was a charming
verse-writer. Two other sisters featured the
gospel of .the Hat.
Taking in a dose of ozone at Manly is
Cecily, daughter of the Speck’s ex-Minister
Teddy Muleahy. An illuminating circlet
adorns the left hand, placed there by a re-
turned warrior, a son of Hobart’s Arch-
deacon Ritchie.
The late E. W. O’Sullivan’s youngest son.
Leo, is wearing the trimmings of the Field
Artillery. One of a> bolting gun-team gave'
him a scalp wound last week, but the injury
isn’t serious enough to keep him from taking
part Over There.
A grand-daughter of oldest Sydney, Mrs.
Annie Parkyns, died at Brooklyn, on the
Hawkesbury, recently, aged 86. Grand-
father was Captain Anthony Fenn Kemp, of
the old Rum Corps; and father welcomed
last century from his house and store_ on
what is now Waters’s Corner, where King-
street bumps into George-street. Being im-
plicated in the Bligh rebellion he went to
England as a witness in the Johnston court-
martial, and, returning, lost all his grants
and leases. Afterwards he went off to Tas-
mania, and stayed there till he was 96. I
don’t know where he went then.
There is sorrow among the workers at the
Red Cross Book Depot, for Mrs. O’Gorman
Hughes, whose recent sudden death caused
such a shock to her friends, was one of the
original workers, and the first of the. devoted
little band to pass over the Dark River. 80
far there have been mostly engagements to
chronicle at 100 Pitt-street, but, alas! these
days gloom comes close upon the heels of joy.
When the last mail left, Captain Cleave,
who in times of peace is magistrate at the
Children’s Court in Sydney, was having an
overhaul in what an officer-pal described as
the Epsom Dry Dock —a war hospital in
pleasant Surrey. “Nothing serious.” said
the officer-pal. “He has been at the Somme,
and is mostly suffering from being 46.” To
this County of London Hospital had just
come a big winter consignment of men suf-
fering from “trench feet,” among them an
Australian black brother who had got the .
trouble so badly that he seemed likely to
have to go about on stumps for the rest of
his days. I don’t know whether he could
get any consolation from knowing that
“Birdy,” most loved of commanders-in-chief,
has been laid up with the same trouble —a
not very usual one among generals. But,
then, ‘.‘Birdy” isn’t a usual general.
The Helmore family, of Christchurch
(M.L.), got a lot of sympathy recently on
the death in France of Ernest Ilelmoro.
who was a lieutenant in the Sherwood ,
Foresters. He went into Sandhurst last
year and passed out with honors. One
week in the trenches —and his bit was done.
Before the strife the young man did duty
as one of the Liverpool aides.
The sympathy of Red Cross circles, as
well as of Sydney artists, is with Dorothea
Barclay, who received news of her mother’s
death in Tasmania on Thursday. Miss Bar-
clay is director of the Red Cross Toy In-
dustry, and for months now has been
battling early and late at the Ash-
street workshop to make this very practical
repatriation scheme a success. Two of
the unselfish toiler’s brothers have died
within the last 18 months; and what
made this last blow particularly cruel
was the fact that Miss Barclay had
at last been persuaded to take an
urgently-needed holiday, and was to have
left on a visit to her mother on February 6,
in company with Miss Ethel Stephens, who
was herself bereft of her mother a few days
ago.
The Y.M.C.A. Snapshots from Home
League got this application the other morn-
ing from old Billjim at the Front: —
Please send me a photo, of my baby, to be born
about Feb. 27.
That’s lining up in the queue for the early-
doors all right, isn’t it?
An Australian singing woman who is
waiting for the clouds to lift writes me
that in dismantled and sand-bagged Venice,
where the canals smell high but it isn’t
etiquette to mention it, the cafe waiter now
demands payment before the traveller eats
his food. The Austrians are everlastingly
bombing the watery place from the air, and
crowds of cunning Venetians were eating
well and escaping payment in the periodical
stampedes until the c.o.d. rule came in.
If you wish to prove yourself one of the
“are nows” and not one of the “has beens”
you may no longer eat your breakfast egg
the way you used to. The egg of fashion
now lies sideways in an oval eggcup, and
your attack is on what used to be its flank.
Well, why not? And the silver sideway set
will come" in for a wedding present, too.
One woman’s way of giving a shove. She
stood near the busy lifts of Sydney’s most
popular tea dispensary the other afternoon
(and I suppose it wasn’t her first appear-
ance), and as each male thing happened
along a white cliook’s feather was with-
drawn from a capacious apron and deposited
in the “civvy’s” nearest pocket. The “civvy’s”
private thoughts of the lady would only bear
publication on a sheet of asbestos.
A Maoriland engagement concerns Nora
Brandon, of Wellington, youngest and pretti-
est of the three sisters of Flight-Captain de
Bathe Brandon, D. 5.0., M.C. Miss Bran-
don went to England to help the war along
and met Reginald Birch, Ist Dragoon
Guards. Now she hopes to help Reginald
along. Another sister married a Hawkes
Bay squatter called Nelson and a third,
Lucy, is usually amateur lady golf champion of
M.L. Another engagement of war-time note
is between Lieut.-Colonel Hugh Stewart, of
the Canterbury Regiment, and Alexandrina
Johnston, of Liverpool. This ’groom-elect
is Professor of Classics at Canterbury Col-
lege (M.L.) in normal times. MiSs John-
ston has made some sort of a name for her-
self at the Liverpool Repertory Theatre.
Rose, eldest daughter of the McCartney
Rookes, of Manly, and grand-dnugliter of
General Rooke, was married at St. James’s
last week to Robert Buchanan Donnell, son
of Major Donnell, of Adelaide. The tall,
fair bride was in a gown of white cachemire
de sole, richly trimmed with crystal beads,
the sleeves being formed of bauds of pearls.
The long Court train was of tulle finished
with thick ruchings of silk; the tulle veil
fell from a band of Limerick lace fastened
with orange blossoms; a hi a shower bouquet
completed a fascinating bridal costume. Four
bridesmaids were froeked alike in dawn-pink
chiffon taffeta with tunics of Limerick lace.
They carried pink i> and wore black
sequined Oriental caps v/ith hanging, jetted
beads. After the wedding -banquet at the
Australia the newly-married went off for a
walk-about before sailing for their home in
Singapore.
There was a novelty at the wedding of
Miss Ilingsch and R. S. Stobo at Newcastle
the other day. As the bride and bridegroom
left the church a number of Y.A.D.’s (the
bride had been one) formed an arch of
mops and brooms, and the first telegram to
arrive was handed the bride in a dustpan.
Miss Alice Bowman’s bungalow at Palm
Beach went up in smoke last week. It was
a charming seaside home, with big airy
living-room, sun- and shadow-trap veran-
dahs, heaps of artistic embroideries and
rugs brought from afar, and the most delici-
ous views of bush and ocean, with Barran-
joey winking his other eye in the distance.
There were thrilling episodes about a cas-
ket of ancestral jewels and an insurance
policy; but I’ve told you quite enough.
Palm Beach is not up to the Florida insti-
tution, but it has its Charms and is gradu-
ally attracting a brainy community—Gar-
rans, Thrings, Curnows, Breretons, Bul-
mores and so on. It was from Miss Bow-
man’s cottage that President Lister-Lister
caught many of the charming seascapes he
showed at the Royal Art Society’s last
exhibition.
The drawing-room of the Bartletts’ New
York apartment in the new comedy, “Fair
and Warmer,” at the Criterion is a medley
of crude colors that sneer bitterly at each
other. The mustard shade, appropriately
enough, gets the last word. The play is
written for, by, with and to husbands, and
all the husbands in the audience greeted it
with exceeding great joy. Dress isn’t the
long suit of the two imported ladies, Misses
Atherton and Royton. A correct English
accent never seems to go amicably with
n6glig6s, anyway. Mr. Marmont, a finished
elderly knut, is the most debonair being
that ever floated into Sydney. But how
we’re going to win a war with things like
“Fair and Warmer’* in our midst I don’t
know.
The go-slow virus seems to be invading all
sorts of places. The telephone girl has it.
The stately pace of the duchesses in the
millinery department has become even a
little more stately; and they look long and
lovingly at their pencils before they begin
to make out your bill- February is a go-
slow kind of month, anyway. Perhaps we’ll
all get a move on in March.
There is an interesting American woman
in Sydney this week —Mrs. Graham, who
has a home in N’York. She is one of the
heads of the American Needlework Guild,
which, having affiliated with the Queen Mary
Guild since the war, has collected and
despatched hundreds of thousands of gar-
ments to suffering refugees from Belgium,
France and Servia. Mrs. Graham was one
of the movers in establishing “work centres”
in Paris and Lyons when the war broke out;
and to this forethought of energetic and
practical American women many a little
seamstress in those cities owed the where-
withal to keep body and soul together
through the first awful months of chaos and
misery.
Major N. C. Lockhart, who in pre-war
days used to devote his grey matter to the
service of the Crown Law Office, aud who
went to England on the Government House
case, has recently been appointed to the
Headquarters Staff of his brigade in France.
Brig.-General Lee and his wife, who used
to be the popular Memie Town, will arrive
in Sydney in a week’s time. The Brig.-
General is to take up his duties as State
Commandant on the 17th.
Gaiety and beauty and money, the indis-
soluble trinity, have been Hocking to Manly
to nibble tea-cake. On a recent Sunday the
crowd included Mrs. Jimmie Osborne, who
used to be the beautiful Mercia to Superbus
Knight’s Marcus. She had a lovely young- .
ster in tow—a future Billzac. The Fred
McMasters and the Philip Mortons and
“Baron” Brown from Newcastle were also
playing around. The twin Macarthurs were
with the Frank and Henry Osborne dames.
By the way, one wonders if it is a sudden
religious scruple, or merely the weariness
caused by the informal dances on Saturday
evenings, that is responsible for the absence
of knitting among Sunday four o’clockers.
In a recent packed lounge only two votaries
of the purl and plain were visible, and one
of them sported a swanking set of tortoise-
shell needles.
After three years in England, Miss Nell
McQuade, of Tarana, is making for Aus-
tralia again. When the llohenzollern got
busy the lady rolled up her sleeves at St.
George’s Hospital, where she has been work-
ing and smiling ever since. However, she
finally tore herself away, and when last
heard of was how-de-doing friends at Singa-
pore.
There is in Hunter’s Hill a man of middle
age who has never been in Sydney nor
travelled on a ferry boat. The nuts of that
sanctimonious little burg are always trying
to rob the poor man of his title to
fame, and one night, by means of strategy,
they lured him on board a boat that was
tied up to the wharf. The moss-grown
celebrity thought it was some new kind of
side-walk. But before the rope could be
untied he realised the dreadful truth, scat-
tered the boys like chaff on a threshing-floor
and made one wild leap for the shore. lie
hit it hard at several different points. But
he saved his reputation.
News from the Fog tells of the engage-
ment for a special high-kick and low-neck
revue of Gwen Williams, only chick of stout
knight Surgeon-General Williams. Miss
Williams, who was launched in the profes-
sion by actor and Mrs. Matheson Lang, and
later made good with the Laurence Irving
Co., is a niece of the Monty Severns.
During the trip up the Northern coast to
the Clarence River in that fast and com-
modious steamer, The Daily Emetic, as soon
as the passengers have completed their share
of the programme the boat herself heaves to
and allows all who are capable of it to drop
their lines and fish for the deep-sea sc-hnap-
per and the ruddy rock-cod. This
Arcadian custom is on a par with that of
the South Coast trains, which about this
time of year pull up for half an hour or so
while engine-driver, firemen, guards and pas-
sengers leap out into the bush and catch
blackberries.
Pitt-street at a quarter to nine is a pro-
cession of workers, women predominating
these days: flappers, alert young business-
women, and, alas! the middle-aged woman
who, in so many cases, has given to the
Empire’s cause the sons who were her sole
support. I wonder how they manage the
lunch question! Many of those women
board; some have tiny one-room-and-share-
the-kitchen flats. In most cases they live
too far from the city to return for the mid-
day meal. That means at least 6d. a day
for the unsatisfying sandwich and tea; and
6d. a day amounts to £6 in the year—quite
a large sum when the average weekly earn-
ings are in the neighborhood of £2 2s. per
week.. I wonder if more large firms
couldn’t adopt the fashion set by the Bank
of N. S. Wales, which provides a luncheon
free of charge to its women workers (the
male members of the staff pay something
nominal), and the menu includes soup, hot
joints, entries, sweets and tea or coffee.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

Do You Get Your Share of the
World's Great Store of Pleasure?
NOT one of us but has his share of the worries and troubles
—they are the heritage of mankind and come unsought.
But the pleasures —we have them only as we make them.
All about is the world’s great store *of the materials of happi-
ness. From it we may choose and build the beauties and the
joys of our lives as we will.
The wonderful art of music!—what material is here for
tinting with rose hues the shadows of life! Here is happi-
ness such as all the world s treasure of gold cannot buy. And
as much of it is yours as you will take!
The Pianola, oldest —and newest —of player-pianos, makes
easy the path to the heights of this beautiful art.
. A ith the Pianola you may hear music and you may play it
—enjoy passively or experience the supreme pleasure of
creating.
The Pianola provides the great musical scope of the piano
and a.technique—a playing ability—that is sure and efficient;
comprehensive of every pianistic effect.
Such an instrument as this will add so much to your own
life, to the lives of your family and friends, its value may not
be estimated in-terms of pounds. But in reality its cost is
very moderate.
The Pianola —made only in these models, viz.: The
Stein way, Steck, Aeolian, Stroud and Weber—is priced as
low as 135 guineas. Any model is purchasable on very
moderate terms. For example—

not necessarily mean a mixture of black and white ; many of these
have an admixture of some fancy colored yarn enough to freshen

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, February 5, 1917.
My Dear Yakiue, —
The compact A.N.A. show is clattering
along in the centre of the huge Exhibition
Building, surrounded by space, draught and
echoes. It is not a large show, but
it is at least intense. Some girls
occupy a hollow square and make
lovely undies just as fast as the whirring
machines can embroider and stitch. Young
men who look lit enough for the firing-line
are attracted by the glass-case shows of
beautiful wax ladies dressed lightly in rib-
bons and lace, and hang over the polished
counters of the enclosure. One of these days
I will beat one of them over the head with
my worst umbrella and make a recruiting
speech.
For those who want ordinary amusement,
there are open-air concerts at which singers
get relaxed throats and much applause. The
prizes for drawing, painting and carving
attracted hundreds of competitors and thou-
sands of admiring (and cursing) relations.
The paintings are skied for safety in the
balcony corridors, and all the studies in the
“nood” are concealed at the very far tran-
sept behind big pillars. If there had been
a dark cellar down a rotten stair they would
have been there. I applaud the wisdom of
those responsible. A lady in a Chloe atti-
tude stands at a window against a blue
velvet curtain; she has a face like the last
of the barmaids. If viewers recover from
that, they may gaze at a siren higher up or
a depraved cherub lying asleep beneath a
purple coverlet. The cherub has three
writhing limbs showing, so he may be a
dyed octopus for all I know.
.A huge exhibit is made up of military
things. There are clothing outfits for any-
body from a private to a field-marshal or
an admiral. Rows of Australian-made wag-
gons are there; also a tiny hand-cart sort
of kitchen, a huge grey-green pontoon and
complete Red Cross ambulances. A boot
section has returned soldiers learning
“clicking” (a sort of leather cutting) and
other detail work. The faded battalion
colors show on the sleeves of their piled
tunics. The Broken Hill mining people have
a huge steel exhibit hemmed in by heaps of
ore and fenced with huge posts of “blooms.”
That our Australian trees have a wonder-
ful future if we can stop people from burning
them is shown by the spread of Australian-
made furniture. Buckley and Nunn make
an artistic display with a heap of lovely
timber in the shape of a dining-room suite.
The set is a fraction of the appointments
lor a five-roomed bungalow, and any girl
can acquire the lot by owning a young man
with £l5O. Of course, the boy is not abso-
lutely essential. Still the canoodly appear-
ance of the armchairs and lounge suggest
that he would not be superfluous either.
Mrs.. Holden, wife of the Harbor Trust
chief, is a busy woman these days. She
takes command at Government House of the
Overseas Club’s special brand of Red
Crossing and works like the busy head of a
sewing-room, patrolling from table to table.
As well as this she runs a smaller Red Cross
of her own at the Harbor Trust offices.
The Mayoress’s Patriotic League is get-
ting busy again in the Town Hall. A mon-
ster meeting was held on Thursday, when
the situation was reviewed and the most
recent shipment of comforts was placarded
for the encouragement of all. Some items:
20,000 socks; 11,000 leather vests; 7000
flannel shirts; 6000 handkerchiefs: 2000
towels; 11 tons of oatmeal; 444 tins of
milk; 100 cases of foods; 50 cases of
smokes; and honey by the ton. Fruit,
“Tommy” cookers and post-cards were
thrown in as padding. There is no more
packing of kits for local soldiers.
In answer to a cable from the Australian
Comforts League in London, the Ilennessy
dame’s League cabled £5OOO to be used
there. A Button Day to refill the treasury
will strike Melbourne on February 23.
Charlie Mason, son of the late Speaker,
who was Associate to 'Justice Hodges before
the war, sends a cooee from France saying
lie has been given the crown and star of a
lieut.-colonel. He landed at Gallipoli with
the first Anzacs as a major. A flying frag-
ment of Turkish lead stopped further fight-
ing or promotion for a while. But after con-
valescing in England and later in Australia
he felt ready for more. Mrs. Charlie takes
breakfast calmly in “blockaded” England—
has been doing so for two years now.
Widower Edward Trenchard crossed to
Maoriland last week to meet his elder daugh-
ter (the Greene Kelly dame) and her chil-
dren. She is coming back from England to
shelter in the paternal home at Toorak until
the submarine plague is beaten. Knight
Greene Kelly is doing his bit somewhere.
You probably remember that he first met his
Australian bride at sea.
Budden, the tiieless commissioner who
has been looking after Billjim’s comforts,
is returning to Melbourne very soon. The
Patriotic Teagues are getting excited about
it in advance, and the Mayor has pro-
mised a civic welcome.
Adelaide’s parcel:—
At last there is some visible result of the agita-
tion against German schools in S. Aus. Four of
them decided not to open after the Christmas holidays
last year. Under the Act, the rest should have
gone out of business last May; and in no circum-
stances may they remain open after the end of this
year. The pupils are being absorbed by the State
schools, and, in some instances, where the teachers
are highly qualified and have made a special decla-
ration of allegiance, the Education Department is
finding occupation for them in non-German centres.
Meanwhile the German J.P. continues to flourish, and
two of him recently called tenders for inquiry by
the Justice Department. A Eudunda carrier named
Frederich Wilhelm Gustav Marchall (no, he’s not
an Italian) was up before them. This brute was
so revoltingly cruel to a sick pony that the liga-
ments of its hind legs were completely severed, and
by police orders the animal was destroyed. The
S.P.C.A. prosecuted, and the defendant was fined£2!
The Museum’s Director, K. R. Waite, is in the
unhappy position of being able to say “I told you
so.” Last year a few specimens of the black rat,
apparently imported from Egypt, made their appear-
ance here and were promptly denounced by him
as likely to very soon become a menace to fruit-
growers. At the time no one took much notice,
but now the visitors have so increased and multiplied
that in some districts they are in thousands, working
havoc amongst the fruit crop and eating marrows,
beans, peas and other vegetables wholesale.
Brig.-Gen. Gordon, at one time our military com-
mandant and familiarly known as “The Army,”
who has held a munitions job in Scotland for some
time, has got a step up. Though he is apparently
still munitioning he is on a higher grade. Tie
begged hard for a job under our Defence Depart-
ment, but couldn’t get one.
The Show is to be a feature of September. The
old grounds, which have been in the hands of the
military for some time, will be available, and as
the hiatus since the last Show is so great it is
suggested that this year it should be a five days’
affair.
T. R. Scarfe’s will has been lodged for probate
and sworn at just under half a million. With the
exception of some bequests to charities and employees
the estate goes to relatives.
One Jack Union, charged with assault at Port
Pirie, pleaded as provocation that the complainant
had addressed him as “President Wilson.” That
was enough. Case dismissed.
The Zoo has just received a consignment of animals
from the United States, the first cargo of the kind
to come here since the outbreak of war. Elks,
skunks, a couple of Alaskan bears and a good many
parrots are amongst the Yanks. Some Huns appear
to have arrived too. and are doing what they can
to destroy the city park lands and gardens. Hoses
have been twisted and damaged and fittings stolen,
young wattle trees uprooted and destroyed, and grass
plots damaged.
The Government’s scheme for the erection of a
new hospital is in temporary abeyance, owing to
the stinginess of the loan market. One of the first
things that is to get badly-needed attention is addi-
tional accommodation in connection with the mental
hospital. Parkside is overcrowded, and there is no
proper provision for the grading of patients, so that
people who are only slightly affected have to lie
sent to Victoria for treatment. The suggestion is
that a receiving ward should be erected in the
Adelaide Hospital grounds, and run as a branch of
the institution at Parkside.
An Adelaide pastor who took his large flock for
a picnic on S. Australia’s most recent holiday says
the festive scene looked like a “miniature battle-
field” about half an hour after lunch, and the
wounded took six hours to tend and cart away.
Stretchers, ambulances and a doctor or two with
morphia all put in strenuous work. Ptomaine poison-
ing was the trouble, but the cause is in dispute.
It must have been the salmon; it can’t have been
the wine.
The Yuille girl who has just become
engaged is the daughter of Albert Yuille—
not Archie. She is the niece of Archie. There
are three Albert Yuille daughters. One is
married to a Chadwick hereabouts; the
second is the wife of architect Hudson, npw
in the trenches; the third is the one who
has just become engaged in England to
Hume Turnbull.
Big Lieut. Edgar Marsden, of the sil-
very tenor, fell ill in France, was sent to
hospital, and fell captive to his white-
capped nurse—an attractive English girl
whom he rashly' describes as “the one
woman worth talking about.” She is
yearning to see Australia. Edgar (his late
father was Government Architect here)
was a Brighton youth who dropped his
Permanent Artillery sword to try his luck
on the English stage, where he figured in
“The Chocolate Soldier.” The war started
while he was holidaying here, and he
promptly cleared out to settle it.
Australians are keeping the parsons busy
in London. . Sydney Fairbairn. of the
Grenadier Guards, son of Stephen Fairbairn,
has married Nancy Cunard, only daughter of
the great shipping family. Young Fair-
bairn’s pretty cousin .Tess has said “Yes” to
Alec Phillip-Russell, whose people have just
returned to Australia. An Anzac is good
enough for her. Jess is daughter of the h reel
Fail-bairns, whose fighting son Beau is also
dashing into matrimony with Miss Hastings,
a kinswoman of the Marquis of Hastings.
The' orange-blossoming of Miss “Gipsy”
Burns, daughter of -Sydneyside Col. Burns,
and Sub-Lieut. Cyril \\ illiams, of the Brit-
ish Flying Corps, and in his spare time third
olficer of a I*, and O. liner, wasn t by any
means as sudden as it seemed. Two voyages
ago Miss Burns came to Melbourne on her
bridegroom’s ship, and it is suspected that
some preliminaries were settled then. As
a matter of fact, there should have been
another wreath at a I’, and O. masthead
quite recently; but there wasn t. 1 liey
did it more quietly still. Do you know the
boat?
Charles Gavan Duffy, who has found
another snug refuge in the Clerkship of the
Senate, has listened to 40 years’ gabble at
the big Parliament House in Spring-street,
lie was one of the Vic. Parliamentary offi-
cials who commenced to receive a Federal
salary when the State gas-tank became the
gasometer for the Commonwealth. life has
seen the longest service of any official in
the institution, though his record is closely
approached by that of Robert Mitchell, the
housekeeper of the Reps., who has been
there for 37 years practising the art of
being affable to everybody.
The lovely Rus-
sian doctor who
is lounging here
in khaki and on
furlough has been
the • central figure
in entertaining the
newly-arrived Rns
sian Consul people.
The doctor has the
attitude of an old-
established Austra-
lian by now, and
motors about show-
ing the new arri-
vals the sights.
One of the new
arrivals who flashed
down Collins-street
in the doctor’s car
showed a fascinat-
ing feminine face
out of an envelop-
ing motor veil. She
was swallowed up
by the Sydney ex
press before Mel-
bourne could view
her excep.t on the wing or discover her
identity.
Lawyer Tom Hogan is in Mount St.
Evin’s hospital recovering from a sudden
serious ’itis. He is a buoyantly-healthy
young man, and is making rapid recovery.
Droopy visitors have to be warned off, as lie
refuses to have sympathisers moaning around
his bed.
The Mackays are back from the West,
where big-hearted. Sam dropped £.">oo into
the Westralian fund for the widows of
fallen heroes. Here in Melbourne he is
shouting aloud for the country to send
Bigjohn Forrest to the Imperial Conference
to represent Australia. Mackay offers to
make one of 20 rich men to contribute
£lOOO to cover the expenses of the jaunt.
The widow and daughter of old-time
cricketer Murdoch are reported to have been
killed by the explosion of the munitions fac-
tory near London. Mrs. Murdoch was one
of the Bendigo Watsons, and had lived in
England for years.
Excellency Liverpool, of Maoriland, plays
tennis with violence ; and at a recent tourna-
ment given by the vice-regals while inhabit-
ing Heaton Rhodes’s place at Christchurch
he was runner up. Next day, at the Wild-
ings’ lawn party, the little Countess took
the palm and the prize along with her part-
ner. Of course, the partner must have
helped.
A great circle of friends was shocked
by the inexplicable suicide of young Levin-
son, son of the Levinsons who are of the
merchant tribe of Benjamin. A lad not
quite 17, and looking only about 14. adored
by his parents, he left his mother brightly
that morning, whistling as he went. In
the afternoon he shot himself.'
The Berry Bank Concert Party, formed
of girls from the Uni. Conservatorium, has
under the management of Miss M. C. Mack
been touring parts of the hospitable Western
District to raise money for the Y.M.C.A..
Red Cross, Mayoress’s Patriotic Fund and
Comforts for the Light Horsemen in Egypt.
The girls met at Berry Bank homestead on
January 9, and afterwards gave concerts at
Lismore, Cressy and Colac. Then they were
motored to Mortlake, Willaura, Terang,
Warrnambool, Camperdown and Peter-
borough, and everywhere had crowded
houses. The tour ended up with a concert
at Peterborough, where the girls spent an
enjoyable weekend as guests of Mrs. A.
Affleck. The Berry Bankers were Misses
Thirkwall. Rous. Stirling. Mack and Jordan,
while Miss Pennicott,. though not a Conser-
vatorium student, threw in frolicsome songs
which thougn quite unknown to the Con.
scored encores always. Roughly speaking
this was the haul: Lismore £l7, Cressy £l3.
Colac £l7, Martin ke £3O. Willaura £2O.
Terang £24, Warrnambool £7O, Camperdown
£27 and Peterborough £20 —altogether a nice
little catch made by girls who reckoned they
could be happier helping brother Rilljiin
than having their usual midsummer loaf.
The fatherly Defence Department
gathered together its clerks and workers of
every kind and gave them a picnic on Foun-
dation Day. About 1000 toilers, etc., got
aboard a chartered bay boat and went to
have a look at the forts and other exhibits
and sideshows. The new State Commandant,
Brigadier-General Sellheim, postponed the
war for the day and took his wife. . The
party lunched on board and dined on land,
near Mornington, where the younger mem-
bers found a big bandstand with a lovely
floor deserted; so they set to and danced
confusion to the Germans. The picnickers
got back in time to read the evening news
about the war ; it was still on.
Billy Hughes is beginning to wear his hair
like Lloyd George, lie is letting it wave in
graceful ringlets over his coat-collar, and
even has the characteristic straight side-
piece of grey. I know all about George’s
hair, as I have watched it blow in the wind
through numerous dumb speeches on the pic-
ture screen.
Genial J. INI. McNally, who is both butter
magnate and water-colorist, has rediscovered
the beauties of the upper reaches of the Salt
Water River. He Ims done some excellent
sketches of its more rustic parts, and tells
entrancing stories about the good fishing to
be had there. True, true —McNally can toll
an entrancing story about anything.
Florence Rockwell, now starring in “The
House of Glass” at the Royal, is a replica
of Edna Keeley, Allen Doone’s leading lady.
Florence has Edna’s curls, Edna has
Florence’s Irish-Ameriean twang-brogue, and
both rush about the stage in the. same way.
I really don’t know how they do it—or why.
The late Henry Brac.v captured one
feminine heart by his strict attention to
dress. I met the mourning chorister last
week and listened to her with interest. She
remembered a fire at Her Majesty’s in Syd-
ney—no great damage done, but water and
ashes everywhere. Bracy’s expression of dis-
may when he came to rehearsal and viewed
the ruins was comic. “What a beastly
mess!” he shivered and looked down in a
horrified way at his brilliantly-polished
shoes now flecked with ashes. The stage
girls regarded him with adoration. He had
an air partly paternal, partly, lover-like, and
altogether charming. This led one day to a
fight on the rehearsal stage between P.racy
and a jealous, lovesick theatre employee.
After the duel, Bracy smoothed out his
lovely clothes and said frowningly: “I did
not so much mind him calling me a cad:
but I could not bear to be called a dirty
cad !”
Chicago papers are fussing over our Elsie
Mackay, as her Melbourne friends can see
for themselves by clippings sent to father
Sam and pretty stepmother Fan Dango.
Elsie is playing Shakspearian heroines under
the management of Ziegfeld. One paper calls
her “a new stage beauty of rare type,” and
declares that she makes “an enchanting
Anne Bullen.” Another declares that she
“promises to become an Australian Miss
Ferguson—or better.”
Melba’s protege, the young Honolulu
lad Correthers (I believe that’s really how
you' spell it), has fallen on his feet. He
had a knack of designing clothes, dress
materials and stage decorations, and has
now received an offer from «a well-known
Londiin firm at a good salary. The young
man helped, Fritz Hart with his opera pro-
ductions and gave lessons in gesture and
stage grouping at the Albert-street Conser-
vatorium.
The Broadmeadows Mending and Soldiers’
Aid Society, which foregathers and works in
Prell’s Buildings, Queen-street, is modestly
proud of letters of praise received from Sena-
tor Pearce and the State Commandant.
Pearce remarks: “It is a work that one does
not hear much about; but though it is not
as obvious as some of the others, it is just
as important and necessary.” Mrs. Ridgwa.v
is secretary of the committee of large-hearted
women who go along to patch the old breeks,
mend the tattered shirt and cobble the holes
in the socks. The soldiers bless them for
their homely help.
I am tipping that Margaret Anglin will
soon make another Australian visit. She is
with Ivolker in America, and Ivolker has
been tuning up his Melbourne friends with
letters lately. They don’t mention a pro-
bable trip—that would be too crude alto-
gether. But a sudden revival of correspond-
ence is always a sure sign that a mummer is
packing up. Well, we are ready for Mar-
garet Anglin, anyway. She left very pleasant
memories behind her.
Yours, sincerely.,
JOHANNA.

“Slybacon”: Re “Rab Cjjbiip’s” question
(B. 11/1/’l7), “When a stockman cracks a whip,
what makes the crack?” The crack is produced in
precisely the same way as the report from a dis-
charged firearm. In the case of a firearm the rapidly
ejected and expanding gases from the explosion
create a partial vacuum in the air, and the rapid
return of the air to fill this vacuum produces the
uproar. So it is with the stockwhip. The tail or
cracker is instantaneously jerked from a curved to
a straight position, thus creating a small partial
vacuum, which produces the crack. A whip cracks
better with a whipcord lash because this lash is
usually lighter and somewhat thicker than the whip
tail, thus creating a greater displacement of air
and consequently producing a louder crack.
A DIGNIFIED REBUKE.
“Wot did you do when 'e called you a dirty German?”
“Just treated ’im with silent contempt on the ’ead with a bottle.”
“Bilbie” : Put these amongst the records
of horses electrocuted by one flash of lightning. In
1910 ten draughts were turned into a paddock at the
rear of the Union Hotel, Trundle (N.S.W.). A
storm coming on the horses made for shelter in
timber -standing at a wire fence. A ‘‘ball of
fire” was seen to pass along the wire, and
afterwards seven horses were found dead and two
paralysed. These latter partly recovered, but they
were useless. In 1914 we were harvesting at A.
Morgan’s farm, five miles from Trundle, when a
storm with vivid lightning broke. Four horses
were unhitched from the stripper, and the driver
made tracks with them for the stable. On the way
a flash of lightning electrocuted the team. The driver
escaped, cleared out to Gallipoli, was invalided home,
but did another bunk and is now safe in the trenches.
“Adelaide”: Enter this for the easy-deatli
competition. Vv T as out in the scrub for a picnic tea.
Went down to the creek with a girl to fill the
billy. Saw a rabbit in a kind of open-work bush.
Slung the billy at him, quite playfully, saying “Get
out of that!” as one might to a dog. Result, one
instantly-dead rabbit, caught on the back of the
neck by the rim of the can. (And the girl thought
me a rather heartless slaughterer, of uncanny skill
with weapons.)
“F.N.T.”: Somewhat scornfully “Pick”
remarks (B. 18/1/’l7) that silo-experts “build upon
the theory that green fodder, even if damp, can be
safely filled into a silo,” and asks the cause of
the trouble with certain horses that passed away
“after eating a musty portion that had been forked
aside.” Well, it’s a simple matter. The unfortunate
brutes suffered from the same sort of frightfulness
that would be likely to overtake “Pick” if he ate
a meal of mouldy fruit. If air is excluded from cut
green-feed fermentation is arrested, and thereby the
Sugar and other digestible items, which during the
normal process of putrefaction are the first to leave
for parts unknown, are retained in the mass. The
feed is chaffed as finely as possible, to assist its
tight packing in the silo ; and if it is a trifle ripe
it is improved by being moistened, while a wet
crop may be used as it is with perfect safety. For
perhaps 12in. from the top of the silage, however, a
crust of mould forms. The farmer must discard
this when starting to use the feed; and such a crust
will of course form again and again if a regular
daily layer is not scraped off for the animals. Just
like any other chaffed green-stuff silage is only good
for stock when fresh. “Pick” fed his on rotting
offal.

“T. Messmate”: As an entry in the re-
sourceful Australian competition I run in Jim, stable-
man in one of the pubs of a North-West town. He
was ordered by the missus one day to take in some
clothes, which the laundress had leff to dry in a
far corner of the hotel yard, about two chains away.
Now it had rained a good drop a few days before
and that portion of the yard was under about
a foot of water. Jim had a look, and presently the
missus coming out saw him saddle the horse in the
stable, mount and gather in the duds, then take the
saddle off and put the horse back. She exclaimed:
“AVhat did you get the horse for, Jim?” ‘-Well,
missus,” he replied, “I wasn't going to be beaten
by a drop of water like that.”
“Toby C.”: For many years black foxes
have been fairly numerous about Monaro (N.S.W.),
but not until recently have albinos appeared, and
now comes the white fox. Albinos occur also in the
magpie household. I have never seen a live one,
but in Itolfe’s pub at Cooma there is a good stuffed
specimen to admire between drinks.
KEEPING UP A FAIR AVERAGE.
M.D.: “Has your husband followed my instructions and taken the pills three times a
day and the drop of brandy going to bed?”
MISSUS: “Well, doctor, ’e ain’t exactly up to date with the pills, but ’e’s a week or
so ahead with the brandy.”
“Eryander”: Found the other day, on
Maroubra beach (N.S.W.), the corpse of a very rare
visitor to these waters —the sea-snake Pelamis bicolor.
Deep black above and bright yellow below, its ap-
pearance accords well with its extremely venomous
capabilities. There are about 50 species of sea-
snake, all very poisonous, but they are practically
confined to the torrid zone, and it is unusual to find
one so far south as Sydney. The body of these
snakes is laterally compressed to almost blade-like
form, the lungs occupy nearly the whole length of
the body, and the nostrils are on top of the snout,
so that the snake can breathe w'hile concealed under
the surface. A valve closes the nostrils when the
reptile dives, and its big supply of lung-air enables
it to stay long below. There is an imitation Pela-
mis, non-venomous, but shaped and colored precisely
like the other. One of these bit me when I was
swimming off Labuan, and record-time was made to
the beach, where I found bv the tooth-pattern that
there was no venom to be dreaded.
* * *• *
“H.V.E.”: The brown snake, which repro-
duces by means of soft-shelled eggs—like those of
a gohanna or other lizard —deposits them under
leaves, brushwood or other d6bris. The diamond
snake, which breeds in the same way, goes one
better. This reptile always makes a nest for its
eggs and coils itself affectionately around them.
Strange to say, the temperature of its body rises
during the breeding season, so that the task of
incubation is not left entirely to the heat of the
sun. One nest fashioned by a diamond snake which
lived under a large (and of course empty) beer
case near a sleeper-cutter’s camp, was made up of
stringy-bark, leaves, dry grass, bracken and scraps-
of newspaper. Into this residence, spherical in
form, the snake (about 10ft. in length) packed
itself wonderfully, with its black coffin-shaped head
resting on top of the great coils and the beady
eyes regarding intruders with a cold, malevolent
stare.
*'*•**■
“Toby C.”: The sassafras tree possesses
virtues overlooked by “Condamine” (B. 11/1/’l7).
The bark makes an excellent preparation for
tanning furred skins, imparting a finished appear-
ance seldom obtained by the use of alum, saltpetre
and similar tanning materials. A strip of the dry
bark thrown into the pickling jar or cask com-
municates a peculiarly agreeable flavor to corned
beef, mutton or pig. Finally, the experienced bush-
man swears by “Sassie bark” in cases of dysentery
or diarrhoea. He scrapes off the soft, moist coating
inside the bark, takes about a teaspoonful for a
dose, and recommends the remedy to the first white
man he meets.
“Tap”: Let me tell “Lou” 'and “Bex” that
they both miss the point in dealing with the curse
of mallee shoots. “Bex” is certainly right when he
says that a running fire on the stubble is the best
method of killing them; but he does not mention
the easy and effective way that is- much used in the
newer Mallee of getting a running fire. If he will
attach a light pine roller well back under the comb
of his stripper, suspended by a wire at each end,
and, say, from six inches to a foot from the ground,
according to the height of his snags, he will find
his stubble lying close enough to the earth to burn
without the aid of a fire-rake. This also saves his
team a lot of unnecessary friction in walking through
standing stubble, and keeps his stripper-comb free
of chokes, if the roller is properly adjusted.
* * * *
“Mendoza”: Horses, cows, poddies, goats
and. giraffes are dead easy, but if you want to stop
that hog from violating the neutrality of the dog-leg
or brush feneff and absorbing the product of the corn
and melon patch you will proceed like this. Take a
piece of tough hardwood about three inches wide
and an inch thick, as long as the width of the Un-
clean One’s jowl, and bore a hole about one inch in
diameter near each end. Then take two pieces of
bamboo, hazel, or any tough sucker about four feet
long apd butt one into each hole and wedge up.
After that take a half-nelson on the hog, and after
passing the hardwood base under his jowl lift on
the sprits until the hog begins to settle down by the
stern. Then cross them over the back of his neck
immediately behind the ears and lash them together
at their intersection with a piece of wire or raw
hide. Fixed'in this way the Rejected of Judah is
at perfect liberty to graze or drink or climb tele-
graph poles, but the flimsiest kind of barricade puts
the high and permanent kybosh on him in one try.
Moreover, no hog, if regularly constituted, can back
out of this yoke without leaving his head behind.
* * * *
“E.S.S.” : Feople are always cursing flies
and mosquitoes, and yet they drive away or kill the
friends —birds, lizards and bats—that would protect
them from such pests. Invaluable are the little
geckos which enter houses and run about the walls
and ceilings, catching the flics. I have watched
these little lizards moving about on my body and
legs as I lay quietly on a bunk. They are wonderful
fly-catchers, superior to the police fly. In places fre-
quented by bats there is no necessity for such
measures as burning cowdung, for the bats quickly
clear the rooms of mosquitoes, and if unmolested
and allowed to use the house as a shelter in daylight
hours they will keep them clear.

DAD'S BATH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dad knocks upon the weather-glass
That hangs behind the kitchen door,
Then on the cloud above the pass
He wastes one solemn minute more.
He gazes on the windward sky, with speculation in
his eye, then calls to mother from the path:
“Ole girl, I think I’ll have a bath!”
“Where’s Bill ? Hi, Billy, come you here!”
And Mum commences waltzin’ round.
“Where is that Bill? Oh, dear! Oh, clear!
The villain never can be found
When wanted most. Hi, Bill, come quick. Prepare
the b’iler. Here’s a brick. Chop up some wood
and split a lath. Your father’s goin’ to have a
bath ! ”
Bub’s calling Nell. Hear Nellie rouse:
“I on’y got one pair iv ’ands.
Who’ll drop the panels for the cows?”
“You come right here,” the Bub commands.
“My word, you will cop out for this. You gotter
fill the b’iler, Miss, and do it slippy, too, be
gosh, for father’s goin’ to ’ave a wash!”
It’s Mum again, abusing Bub:
“You lazy good-for-nothing, try
To move for once. Bring up the tub.
Dan left it there behind the sty.
Dan, get a towel from the box, and cut some soap,
you stupid ox. Say, did yous hear your father
say he’s goin’ to ’ave a bath to-day?”
Bub burns her hands, much water’s spilt,
Mum slithers on the soap, and then
Dad comes out, gathered in a quilt,
And peeks up at the sky again.
“A change,” he says. “It ain’t so ’ot. I dunno,
p’raps I’d better not. I’ll wait, Mum.” (It is
father’s joke. The old man never has that
soak!)

GREAT DANGER OF INSECT BITES.
Protect Yourself Against Ordinary
Dangers by Using NEV-A-BITE.
A Preparation of Proved Effectiveness.
“There is no question,” says a leading specialist,
“that insect bites may lead to great danger to
health, and have been known to end fatally.”
The dread Mosquito,
whose bite is perhaps
the most dangerous of
all insects.
This alarming
statement, which
lias appeared in
the influential
newspapers of this
country, should
arouse the public
to the fact that
bites from mos-
quitoes and other
insects are things
to worry about.
It is quite pos-
sible that if one’s
blood is in a poor
state an insect bite
might set up such
serious inflamma-
tion as to cause blood-poisoning, and —as every-
one well knows—blood-poisoning may lead to
even the amputation of a limb.
The best form of treatment of mosquito
bites is prophylactic or preventive. The appli-
cation of a little of the NEV-A-BITE
lotion reduces the probability of mosquito bites
to a minimum.
NEV-A-BITE is a perfectly harmless
preparation, and serves to whiten, soften and
beautify the skin.
If NEV-A-BITE is unobtainable from
your local supplier, send 1/2 in stamps to one
of the following, viz:—
Duerdin & Sainsbury, Flinders Lane, Melbourne.

“Karee” (from the Front) : Re “TiakiV
par. (B. 12/10/T6) anent the gentle Maori tunga
wood-grub, is it any relation of the Queensland
“booyum,” which lives in young gums and looks
like a lollystick painted in pink and-white shades?
Binghi quaffs them alive, but I’ve only indulged in
them roasted on coals. When the skin cracks and
turns a rich brown is the time to banquet. The
taste savors of prawns. A memorable fight took
place on Stewart Island (Q.) with nulla nullas and
language, between my young brother Jean and Garry
Mop’rah’s youngest olive branch, for the possession
of a billyful of the luscious worms, gathered by
the noble black man's progeny. Just as Jean was
forcibly proving to Garry junior the superiority of
the white race, Eileen, sister of Garry, collared the
loot, and climbing a convenient “apple” negotiated
the lot, in spite of the fiery speeches and nullas
hurled at her by the now allied warriors.
* * * *
“Simon”: Re sassafras timber (B.
11/1/’ 17). The quality of this wood was discovered
30 years ago by two Englishmen who, as a result
of the Victorian tariff, came here to manufacture
saddle-trees. Tasmanian sassafras ( Atherospenna
woschata) was hit upon as the .most nearly approxi-
mating English beech, and consequently the most
suitable for the work. Time has vindicated their
judgment. However, they needn’t have gone to
Tassy for it, as this and another sassafras (fancy
name Doryphora sassafras) are plentiful in both
Victoria and N. S. Wales.
* * * *
“Sarto”: Whilst splitting a red-gum log
the other day a lizard-like apparition about Si
inches long dropped out of a cavity in the-wood.
The hole was about nine inches long and three-
quarters of an inch in diameter, and his nibs had
evidently lain there for some time, judging by the
markings from his skin on the vegetable. He was
prettily tattooed on the back —black, with a wide
zigzag band of dirty yellow from the head to begin-
ning of tail, with yellow spots thrown in. The
underneath part was all white, as also were the
four tiny hands (or feet), whose appearance, and
the owmer’s general behavior on being released, de-
noted that it was his first introduction to the out-
side world. In- shape he was about the ugliest beast
I've met. His head was like a snake’s, and he had
a broad, flat tongue, the front half of which was
black. The tail narrowed where it joined the body
and looked as if it had been stuck on as an after-
thought. The only part that took my fancy was
the eye, which was a beautiful, shining bronze orb.
When I pointed a bone at him up went head and
tail simultaneously, and with mouth wide open the
little devil presented a vicious appearance. ’ What
was it ? And did it go into that hole in the log or
was it born there ?
FORGOTTEN.
“Did you see old Ben —you know old Ben,
’oo was ’ere twenty years ago—when
you was down in Sydney?”
“No, I never seen ’im.” (Strikes a match.)
“I looked, but I’m sure I never seen
’im.” (Puff! Puff!) “Don’t s’pose I
would ’a’ known ’im if I ’AD seen ’im.”
“Mamo”: Let the big-team bullock-
punchers pull off the track to make room for Tom
Wilkinson, with his string of 70, drawing 22 tons of
wool from Tarbrax to Maxwelton (N.Q.).
DURING THE DROUGHT.
BLACK ANDY: “ Mine tinkit boss giftin’ hardup.”
OVERSEER: “Oh, how’s that?”
BLACK ANDY: “Him tell longa me dis mornin’ missus hare new baby. Him wantin’
five quid, mine tinkit.”
“Wandi”: In Central parts the flood-
bird (Australia’s largest cuckoo) jumps the nest of
ihe crow, throws out the latter’s eggs and deposits
its own in their place. The crow hatches them, and
feeds the young flood-birds until they are pretty
well fledged, by which time Mrs. Crow begins to
have suspicions. Finally she consults Mr. Crow.
“Look here, Nick,”
she says, “do you
call them crows?”
Nick sidles along
the edge of the nest,
eyeing them criti-
cally. “Well, I’m
blowed,” he says at
last, and he looks
hard at Mrs. Crow.
After a heated dis-
cussion the little
aliens are roughly
and wrathfullv fired
out to battle for
thems elves. The
pink-eared duck also
appropriates t h e
crow’s nest, consti-
tuting thereby a re-
markable anomaly in
bird life, for the
crow’s sharp eyes
are always on the
lookout for eggs
secreted in such
nests as the average
duck makes in rank
grass. Unlike the
flood-bird the pink-
eared duck turns the crow out and hatches its
own eggs. A duck laying and sitting in a twig
nest built on the branch of a tree is in itself a
curious departure from the general habit of ducks.
* . * * *
“Corio”: The harness-cask was empty,
so, with the object of providing fresh beef, a
kangaroo-hunt was promoted. A deep ravine flanked
the camp, and it was resolved to drive the animals
thither, where they could be easily brought to a
standstill and despatched by the dogs. We mounted,
a party of three, and when the first ’roo was roused
we headed him after a gruelling chase into the
valley. Escape was impossible save over the
ravine; but with a leap for freedom the ’roo
cleared the trap and alighted safely on the opposite
side. Upon spanning his jump with a ball of twine
it was discovered to measure 35ft.
* * * *
“Hay”: “Two Seas” wonders why so
many ’roos are found hanging dead with their hind
legs through the top wires of fences. The ’roo
never jumps to any height when scared or hunted,
but travels with a long low swing which looks more
like running than jumping. When he strikes a fence
his leg goes between the wires, and his frantic efforts
to get free only tightens the twitch. When the coun-
try was first fenced I have seen dozens of them
caught that way. Likewise emus.
“P.A.Q.”; Blow into Shorty Buckland’s
pub last week, and met my old friend Timi Tapu.
He was gazing wistfully into an empty pintpot.
Tlmi’s son is at the war. “Hallo, Timi,” I said ;
“how’s the boy getting on?” “Oh, he’s kapai,”
said Timi. “I just get te retter from him ; but, py
gorry, he te tarn riar, my son, I tink.” “How’s
that?” I asked. “Werra, rook here. How te way
this for te tarn rie? Ho say in te retter when te
airship he come arong te British lie’s got te gun
what fire te five mires in te air. ■ He can’t do it,
isn’t it?” “That’s quite right, Timi,” I said. “They
can fire five miles up all right.” “By gorry,” said
Timi, “I didn’t know he could do that.” “But
risten to this one —he te .proper rie, I sure. He say
te man he go up in te barroon for to make it te
rook out. By and bye he send te message that te
prooming Teherman he’s twenty mires away. Then
bang goes te gun and te Teherman, 20 miles away,
is provven to herra quick.” “Biit that’s not a lie,”
I assured. “Werra I don’t know,” he rejoined. “That
te funny ting anyway. But rook here at this. Now
ain’t it te tarn rimit? He say tay got te big boat
what he can swim under te water and fire te bressed
gun under te' water too. I pet that one te rie,
wasn’t it?” “No,” I said, that’s not a lie —all
these things are true. And they can do more won-
derful things than that.” “Werra, if tem tings
true,”* mused Timi, “that te funny way to fight.
You know I thought Henare he pu’ my reg. But,
py gorry, if that te proper war to have these thing—
werra, you know what I think: te Maori war he
must ha’ been onry te pranky pig-hunt.”
“Tiger”: Cow-cockies take notice! A
Jersey cow, the property of W. Lindsay, Devonport
(Tas.), on January 2 gave premature birth to four
bull calves. She had an argument with another lady
the day before and the calves were born dead.
Anyone beat it?
* * * *
“E.S.S.”: A general favorite is the Aus-
tralian reed-warbler ( Acrocephalvs australis), a
plain brown little fellow who is persistent with his
pleasing tune, singing in the night as well as through
the day. Excepting the blue wren, who sometimes
delivers a nocturne from the roost, only one other
Australian bird, the bush-lark, sings at night. His
song has been declared by ornithologists to be louder
ahd more melodious than that of any . of his European
relations, Gregory Matthews, referring to the grey,
shrike thrush, the reed-warbler, the golden-breasted
whistler and the butcher-bird, says: “I prefer any
of these native songsters to the English nightingale
or thrush, while as for the reed-warbler I consider
he stands in a class by himself.” He is a familiar
habitant of river-sides, reedy swamps and sedgy
lagoons and lakes, often sociably sharing the same
spots with the grass-bird, or marsh-warbler, a little
brown chap whose weird and plaintive voice is
principally heard at night-time. The reed-warbler
is a friendly fellow, venturing into gardens after
insects; and while rendering excellent service in that
way he charms all hearers with his rich whistling
notes. To the Southerners he is a joyous harbinger
of spring; to the Northerners a cheery herald' of
winter.
“J.R.K.”: When mosquitoes are thick
around your camp, and no cattle manure is handy,
take two grass-trees, place them parallel with one
another and light a fire between. It will only
smoulder, but the smoke is the most deadly thing
on insect life that 1 have seen.
* * * *
“Amateur Biologist”: It is a curious fact
that when a Dutch yellow rabbit is crossed with the
Himalayan variety—white body, with black legs,
black ears and black snout—the offspring are all
agoutis, the color of the ordinary wild rabbit.* This
exemplifies a reversal to ancestral type. If the
individuals of this progeny are mated, the propor-
tional composition of the next generation is: Agoutis
27, yellows nine, blacks nine, tortoiseshell three, and
Himalayans 16. Thus several characters result from
the two different grandparents. As a result of the
mating of the white variety of mouse with the
chocolate variety, the chocolate variety alone is pro-
duced ; on breeding together the individuals of this
generation the offspring are chocolate and white in
the proportion of three to one. If the whites of
this generation are bred together, whites only are
produced. But on breeding together the chocolates
of the same generation, chocolates and whites in
the proportion of three to *one are again produced,
and so on.
“Merrigal” Amongst the best-known Cen-
tral Australian forage plants the clustering saffron
green-fingered Parakeelia is easily favorite. Stock
fall over themselves in pursuit of it and camels fed
on alternate nights with it need but few other
rations on the voyage. The vegetable choice of
homes is in the vicinity of Warriwell, and it is
found nowhere on the surface of the continent out-
side Centralia.
AS A MATTER OF PATRIOTISM.
“Give you sixpence, you big, lazy scoundrel!
I wouldn’t give you a ha’penny! Why
don’t you go to the war?”
“Well, I did think of it once or twice, boss.
But, then, why should the likes of me
be took orf in their prime when there's

THE BACK LOG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The grates that they have in the houses in town,
And their quaint imitations of wood,
Make a fellow feel cold when he’s asked to sit down
For “a warm” with the resident brood.
There’s room round the hearth for a pair and a half,
And no chance for the cat and the dog—
In the places / know you could roast a big calf,
And a dozen sit round the back log.
The fireplace was wide as a skillion, and deep ;
’Twas plain and old-fashioned, maybe;
But cosy and snug, and no trouble to sweep,
And ’twas always inviting to me.
With the fire in the centre there seldom was need
With a maul or with axes to slog;
lou could drop in long sticks as you’d drop in a
reed,
And behind them a solid back log.
The v?alls were whitewashed with wood-ash from the
bed
Where we roasted potatoes and yams;
Salt meat was hung round on stout nails overhead,
W T ith bacon, bananas and hams ;
The chains and the pothooks hung down from the
beam—•
At its elegance none stood agog;
But there we could 101 l in sweet comfort and dream
In the light of a blazing back log.
We lined the wide front and we squatted each side,
There was nobody left in the cold ;
And many a laugh then went echoing wide,
And many a story was told.
When winter winds wailed round the cornel’s at night
Or the landscape was shrouded with fog,
Or when icicles formed on the leaves in the bight—
Oh, then we enjoyed the back log.

v “HEARNE’S”
“Jean S.”: The musical evenings pro-
vided by the orchestra at Melbourne Royal
are worth the money. The other night,
when I looked in, a very fair house was
hugging its seats in evident enjoyment of
the melodious fare. The menu included
Suppe’s “Morning, Noon and Night’' as
hors d’oeuvre, followed by a bit of
“lolanthe,” Flath’s “Summer Dream,”
Ivan’s valse “La Russe,” Kenyon’s “Flower
Suite” and two helpings of “Gorsave.” For
me, however, the musical performance was
marred by unseemly interruptions. Several
people, who looked and occasionally talked
like actors, had an altercation about a glass
house or something of the kind. I am
rather hazy about the details. The discus-
sion was not sufficiently protracted to ex-
cite much attention, but it was very annoy-
ing while it lasted. I wish the J. C. Wil-
liamson management would reprimand the
intruders. If they are not spoken to imme-
diately, they might abuse their small privi-
leges and get the delusion that they are the
entertainment.
“II.O.” : With most of its young men at
the war and its young women sewing—er—
seeds of kindness on their behalf, Melbourne
Repertory Theatre has not been flourishing
of late. A performance of “The Amazons,”
which was to have taken place last month,
did not come to pass, and nothing is certain
regarding future programmes. Meanwhile
Repertorians are agreed on one point—that
it is up to them to show their appreciation
of the work director Gregan McMahon has
done, and arrangements are now in hand to
give him a benefit. Also, while talk of estab-
lishing a Shakspeare Memorial Theatre is
loud in the land, and press barrackers are
shouting the name of imported Allan Wilkie
as the man for the job of director, many less
noisy persons are agreed that if there is one
man more than another entitled to such a
position it is the Repertory Theatre direc-
tor. Other considerations apart, Wilkie’s
incurable habit of hanging cheap necklaces
of gags around the English classics should
put him out of court.
“Jwosp” : Said David Belasco in his fore-
word to “Training for the Stage” : “Intelli-
gence is desirable, but not necessary. The
merely brainy is never a great actor on the
stage. The heart is greater than the brain.’
Not a word about the hide!
In a London revue, “Vanity Fair,” Gwen-
doline Brogden is singing a ditty, “Anzacs,
supported by a chorus in a “costume typical
of the Antipodes.” Said costume is in grey
and orange, and in cut resembles that worn
by Belle Diamond, the Pride of the Prairie,
or some such person, in 9435 wildwesto-
dramas. Its most prominent feature is a
hat that makes Kink O’Malley’s headgear
look like a mere candle-extinguisher.
“Stargazer”: Rarely—never lately have
I left the theatre after witnessing ,an Ameri-
can play without feeling something of the
moral abasement that comes upon a simple-
ton when he realises that the plausible
gentleman to whom he-has just trusted his
five-pound note is a spieler. Take “Ihc
House of Glass,” for instance. Up to the
last act I liked the play for what it was
worth—a clever bit of mechanical designing.
Then it was made apparent to me that 1
was the victim of a shameful take-down,
and that the author was an ethical con-
fidence man who had sold me a gold brick.
When his Ex. the Governor chipped in at
the tail-end of the adventure, and put every-
thing right for Mrs. Flarvey Lake, I per-
ceived that he might have been persuaded to
intervene in the interests of so influential
a dame at any stage, and the dramatist had
kept this fact dark to delude us into the
belief that a tragedy existed where there
was really no tragedy at all. In any case,
one always feels there is something rotten
in the state of a drama that calls in a pre-
viously-unused character to mop up the
mess in the final five minutes.
Patterson is a distinct anti-climax, and Ihe
House of Glass” is less worthy of respect
than a trick matchbox.
“S.S.” : Florence Rockwell, now appearing
at Melbourne Royal, has much to commend
her as an actress, but I don’t give her a
10-to-one chance of making a hit m this
city. She can do numerous things pretty well,
but she can’t dress, and it is many yeais
since an actress who was not also a cute
frocker has taken a fair grip on Melbourne s
ardent young affections. A pink dress Miss
Rockwell wears in “The House of Glass
is 'sufficient to destroy all feminine respect
for the wearer, and no actress can expect
to score in Melbourne nowadays who hasn t
the girls on her side in a body. Another
offence is Miss Rockwell’s manifest inability
to wear her own hair in a becoming way.
One must be a very good actress to be
contemptuous of the hairdresser. One must
be magnificent to be contemptuous of tne
dressmaker. But not even a genius can
afford to be contemptuous of both.
“Van Eck”: Leaving for U.S.A. shortly,
C. -L. Yearsley, for the past seven years
press barracker for the Film Combine.
Yearsley first came to Australia for J. D-
Williams to write big display film advts.
in the Sunday papers. He goes into busi-
ness in Yankeeland, leaving Bob Dexter,
his understudy, to employ his old pen in Aus-
tralia.
“Reel Six”: I sat through a beautiful
Yankee film in which a parson who had been
deceived by his wife, but thought he had
been deserted by the Creator, shook his nst
at the sky and howled. “Gahd! you an me
have split!” I’m wondering how the Kaiser
will admonish his Maker when the end comes.
Adelaide picture-shows are being given a
rotten time. Daylight saving makes any
open-air showing impossible much betore
9.15"; and there are two separate amusement
taxes, requiring much handling of s “ a
change and complicated accounts. I> OW “
local film-censorship is proposed, home o
the films lately have been “asking tor it >
but to have State censorship as well as
Federal is clearly absurd, and a strong depu
tation to the Chief Secretary got a Poetical
promise that double-bankifig wonld be
avoided.
The Inky Way.
Got out his last issue, Walter Cummyi
Macdougall, proprietor of Balmain (Sydney)
Courier. Over 30 years ago lie founded it
and kept the press running with a single eye
to the well-being of his noisy water-suburb.
He stood for Parliament once, but the elec-
tors reckoned he was more valuable at his
inky job and refused to excuse his absence.
* * * *
Brig.-Genl. Ernest Williams, C.M.G. in
the last list, is another newspaper man who
reckoned the sword mightier than the pen.
In much younger days he attached himself
to the Ballarat Courier, and became its
editor. After leaving his impression on the
cushion on which the late E. -T. Bateman
sat so long, Williams sighted a better place
in the town clerkship of Ballarat. For a
time he has been acting-Commandant of the
Vic. military district.

“Vic”: Joe Cowen Syme’s probate is a
trifle under £130,000. So he seems to have
dropped £lO,OOO of the £140,000 which lie
got from Davy Syme for his half-share in
the Age, besides any shillings he made him-
self. Nevertheless he cut up pretty well,
considering that he was caught by the Band
Boom.
* * * *
“Ilassan’s” call to the craft: —
The new American manager of a picture-films co.
gave a number of newspaper men a dinner on a recent
Saturday night. The general tenor of the speeches
was to the effect that the host had fed the pressmen
handsomely and deserved well of the country. One
speaker declared that, the Government •should subsi-
dise an American film co. because it purposed pro-
ducing Australian stories with lankee actois. He
did not explain why. Another speaker remarked
that of course, while all criticisms of films weie
perfectly honest, the space allotted to each company
was in direct ratio to the amount of advertising.
I believe that the second statement was perfectly
true. The host replied that the rule concerning
advertising was that a certain amount of the profits
of a firm was allocated to advertising. Perhaps the
profits would not be very high to begin with; but
he hoped and believed that the press would help
the film firms to make huge profits, because the
huger the profits tire larger the advertising. ...
Now this was an exhibition of just that sort of
thing which gives newspaper men a had name. It
lias been generally noted that if you want am thing
from a pressman you must feed him or give him
cigars or whisky. This salesman got the pressmen
together to put them under an obligation to him,
and they, to use one of his Americanisms, “fell for
it.” The queer part of it is that if an advertiser,
to gain any advantage, had attempted a money bribe
to most of these same men, he would have earned
only enmity.
* * *
“J.F.H.” : We now number a noble duke
his Grace of Manchester —among us!
True, we might not have known it had he not
been obliged to stand his trial in London for
not having disclosed the fact that he was an
uncertificated bankrupt when making certain
purchases. Then it came out —his Grace was
“expecting £lOOO from his editor m
America,” subsequently amplified by the
information that he is the “London Society
Correspondent” to the Hearst papers. The
previous Duke of Manchester was a Presi-
dent of the Royal Colonial Institute and,
visiting Australia at the time, was roped in
(for a consideration, it was said) to formally
open the Silverton Tramway Co.’s railway to
Broken Hill. It was a glorious drunk, I
know.
* * * *
From a winged Billjim :
Beatrice Harraden, novelist, is doing her bit as
librarian in the Endell-street Hospital, London,
where some hundreds of us are convalescing. It’s
unique in its way—staffed entirely by women, and
none the worse for it. “What do they read?”
someone asks her. “Books on England,” she says,
“bushranging stories, and their own poets.” Some
“will read nothing but Nat Gould.” Garvice,
Oppenlieim, Boothby, Haggard, Corelli, Dickens and
Clonan Doyle are among the also rans. Kipling
is the most popular of the poets, and many of the
fellows get off his gingles by heart while they are
being patched up. “Society” novels are never asked
for ; while Shakspeare, Beatrice is delighted to find,
“holds his own surprisingly well.”
* * * *
“Quarter Single”: The petty jealousy of
daily journalism discovered by “Fx” (B.
25/l/’l7) is a matter of routine so far as
the Melbourne morning dailies are con-
cerned. The practice of each is to ignore
the other utterly. “Fx” is disgusted with
the Age because, in referring to Florence
Sandes’s work in Servia, it omits to men-
tion her brother Johnny Sandes, _ who was
for years on the Argus. Rut the Argus
soon' got a bit of its own back A few days
later it reviewed “Pip” Schuler s excellent
but ejaculatory history of Gallipoli, Aus-
tralia in Arms,” and, while admitting it
to be the most complete account yet pub-
lished of the Australian army’s doings in
the war, scrupulously refrained from men-
tinning that Schuler is the son of G. r. H.
Schuler, editor of the Age, and that young
Schuler had been on the staff of that paper
and is now in khaki.
* * * *
“Bad Australian”: Recently Kultur
struck a nasty snag in this sinful city
(Buenos Aires) over the publication of a
number of plainly-expressed articles by
French and Belgian writers on the destruc-
tion of Louvain University, Rheims Cathe-
dral and several other victims of Hunnish
criminal lunacy. A hen these articles
appeared in the Nacion the German Min-
ister rushed a demand on the Argentine
Government that a stopper be put on the
chief organ of public opinion in this country.
While he foamed on the doormat he was in-
formed in studiously polite terms that the
only steps the Government felt at liberty to
take was to oblige the paper to publish the
German official denial of the charges. Then
the foamer foamed worse than ever and
called upon every squarehead in Buenos
Aires to cut loose from the Nacion, where-
upon they immediately withdrew their ad-
vertisements and subscriptions like one Hun.
The Minister then took a long lager and
a second helping of sauerkraut and sat back
and smiled. But when the next issue of
the Nacion came out with a notice on the
most conspicuous part of the front page that
it would not accept cheques drawn on the
Banco Tranatlantico Aleman in any circum-
stances, that Minister was the maddest and
most astonished diplomat in South America.
He made a new and immediate appeal to
the Government, only to be told that it had
no legal right to oblige any person to accept
cheques on any bank whatever. Then the
great German Transatlantic Bank was
rushed by its depositors and forced to close
its doors' for the day. That same evening
a whipped Hun crawled along to the good
Argentine citizen who runs the Nacion and
prayed for grace, which was duly accorded
him —along with a quantity of good advice.
* * * *
“B.B.” : It is not often that a Governor
has an opportunity of makings full-blown
thistle-eater of himself, so perhaps Liver-
pool, of Maoriland, is to be excused for
indulging himself the other day. He was
“reviewing” a hospital-ship staff when he
observed a newspaper man close handy.
Promptly breaking loose, he wanted to
know what the and why the, etc. Then Ink-
fingers (who, as a matter of fact, wasn t
bothering about the vital information which
his Ex. said was “confidential”) had to
accompany an escort. The pressmans
notes (they were about a meeting of a road
board) were taken from him, and he was
given a sailor’s farewell. Of course it was
a good “story” for his paper (,Bun,_ Christ-
church) and he made the most of it. The
next act in the comedy was his Ex. rush-
ing to explain. But nobody wanted him to
explain. The laugh was over.
Another Bulletin contributor, Walter
Kilroy Harris, has got the Military Cross.
This hustling young Australian came from
Newcastle, from which town, canvassing for
ads., he once overlanded to Adelaide in a
sulky. He wrote a book about that journey,
and, characteristically, sold out the issue.
Harris ranks as lieutenant at the Front,
and is a young man who will take a lot of
stopping.
* * * *
Jack Hilton, who has held the wheel of the
Westralian Labor paper since the wobbly ship
was launched, stands down after something
over three years’ toil. He put in a lot of
good work, 'but the man at the wheel on a
Labor journal has little chance of getting a
sound foothold. Hilton is one of Australia s
champion chessmen —can play 10 simultane-
ous games with his hands on a typewriter,
while dictating three games over the wire
for an international contest, and filling in a
cable message showing the market price of
jute at the time of going to presss.
“Rye Dry” : The country editor who won
fame by bringing out a paper without the
assistance of reporter, comp, or machinist
has had his feat challenged by a mere city
tenderskin. Martin Brennan, editor of
Variety (Sydney), has just produced 84
pages of mostly theatrical stuff. He wrote
practically the lot, “set” nine-tenths of it
and secured and wrote the ads., and is now
his own collector of accounts.
*. * * *
“Sardonyx”: Without defending the pre-
valent literary use of “o’-” for “of,” I may
point out to “S.T.S.” (B. 25/l/’l7) that
this form not only foes reflect a colloquial
way of speaking—the Scottish —but that, it
was in the past quite customary in familiar
English, in which “a” was also frequently
used for “of,” as in “Ivate-a-Whimsies” and
“John-a-Dreams.” Anyhow, we need not go
abroad. The average Sydneyite speaks of
“a couple of days” as “a-kuppla-dies.
“S.T.S.” says that “where the ‘f’ really
wants dropping one has to write ‘kinder
and ‘sorter’ to give the effect.”. Hardly an
improvement upon “kind o’ ” and sort o .
The latter form involves only legitimate
elision; the former interpolates the vulgar
Cockney “r.”
. * » *
“Yinsonlee”: Progress is taking great
strides in the Chinese Republic since the
death of President Yuan Shih Kai, and
every month brings forth numerous radical
changes. Yuan fettered the press with a
strict censorship, but the more popular Pre-
sident Li Yuan Hung, laying much stress
on the educative influence of newspapers,
has removed all the former restrictions. To
illustrate what progress journalism has made
in China, I may mention that the doings ot
the Parliament are now almost immediately
public property in the remote interior.
Whether the press will retain its new free-
dom I don’t know. Neither does anybody
else that I’ve spoken to on the subject.
TO A FRIEND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A faded brain, seeking to rouge its thought,
Here finds its toilet-table neatly spread ;
And here a thousand freaks and fancies caught
Rest each within a narrow, inky bed.
All that philosophy and science tanght
Is here to some plain words and phrases wed.
I love you for your deep humility,
And for your large, dogmatic, fearless pride;
Your information boundless as the sea,
Your swift suggestion eager as its tide;
And mostly you have told the truth to me
When others frequently and wildly lied.
I come to you because I do not know,
I come to you because 1 cannot spell;
I run my finger down from row to row
Seeking the secrets you alone can tell.
The half-remembered fancy seems to glow
When you accord it life and taste and smell.
All precious gems are yours, all golden spoil.
All treasures of all ages round you stand.
All wealth of harvest, corn and wine and oil,
• You give to him who seeks with open hand.
I come to you for herb and fruit and soil,
And all that ever was on sea and land.
Men print a thousand books for men to read,
Hut you forever keep a place apart.
The world may ponder Shakspeare’s magic screed,
Or pluck the thousand blooms that freshly start
From storied records rich with faith and deed ;
But you, O Dictionary, hold my heart!

POLITICAL
POINTS
Eight years ago Australia had a sub-
stantial surplus of exports over imports and
paid £9.341,108 during the 12 months in
(Customs revenue. To-day the excess is on
the other side, and in the last seven months
£9,493,330 has been paid in duty on the
foreign goods. Production is falling, imports
are increasing, debt is going up with a bang,
and then distracted people wonder why men
are out of work.
Professor Woodrow Wilson has been
quoted lately as giving tlie best definition of
the German Empire :
It is a Federal State composed of four kingdoms,
seven grand-duchies, four duchies, seven principali-
ties, three free cities and the Imperial domain of
Alsace-Lorraine, these lands being united in a great
corporation of public law under the hereditary
Presidency of the King of Prussia. Its Emperor is
its President, not its Monarch.
A profound knowledge of law is a terrible
handicap to a national leader in these days
of anarchy and sudden death. While he is
looking up the exact status of his murder-
ous neighbor, there is another shriek and a
thud outside,, and some more blood trickles
in under the library door.
HIS GUIDE, PHILOSOPHER AND
FRIEND.
GERMAN SOCIALIST : “Gott in himmel, if
mein stomach vos suffer much more I
vill ’ave to sack dot monkey. ’E vos
lead me all wrong.”
The Victorian railways having gone from
bad to worse, and the party politician not
being game to say what is the matter, the
Government has decided to import Tom
Johnson to make a report. The problem is
a commercial one; and Tom Johnson, being
an engineer, naturally knows all about com-
merce, just as Alec Peacock, being a secre-
tary of mining companies, knows all about
astronomy. All that is the matter with
Yic. railways is that, owing to early land-
grabbing and later-day centralisation, nearly
everything is carried twice as far as it ought
to be, while, owing to the ‘cursed slowing-
down, expenses have increased enormously.
Here is a nice little table showing how work-
ing costs have raced ahead: —
Per Mile Worked. Per Train Mile Run.
1902 .. £666 46.07 d.
1912 . . 971 59.70<1.
1913 . . 986 60.52 d.
1914 . . 1032 61.73 d.
1915 .. : 1101 66.47 d.
A State has no need to import a Tom John-
son to tell it what happens in such circum-
stances. Either it must increase its railway
charges enormously, too, or it must lose
money. And if it increases its railway
charges it reduces the chances of successfully
settling the country, cuts down the revenue
and prospective revenue, and thus only gets
deeper into the bog.
Of the three or four countries in the world
actually making money out of the war
Maoriland is one. Yet she is wading deeper
and deeper into debt. Out of her immense
war profits she could easily have kept from
borrowing. Instead, she lias gone on the
insane doctrine that “posterity should bear
its just share of the burden” —and sent Joe
Ward to England to, among other things,
“address war-loan meetings.” Naturally
lou is in his element telling the British
public to dip into its pocket. But he can
be relied on not to explain that, though
owing millions to a mother that badly
wants them now, Maoriland is making mil-
lions out of the old lady and not repaying a
penny.
Joe Cook, talking last week of the Lloyd
George Conference to be held in London,
said that “the Prime luinister should repre-
sent Australia.” Asked if he meant by “the
Prime Minister” Mr. Hughes or a possible
successor, Joseph replied: “I mean the
Prime Minister of Australia.” But why?
The Prime Minister is not necessarily the
best man for every special job. Suppose N.
S. Wales had to be represented at the con-
ference and Jim McGowen were still
Premier, could it be decently argued that
McGowen should go if Holman was avail-
able?
If the Australian Navy wants an oil-fuel
supply made from Tasmanian shale, the
Commonwealth Gov-
ernment will have to
put up the necessary
works itself. The
Speck’s House of
Dodery will not allow
• the Speck’s Govern-
ment to risk the
money. Premier Lee’s
proposal was to buy
out the Railton-La-
trobe co. for £65,000
and borrow money for
a plant from the Com-
monwealth. But at)
the last moment the
local Chief Inspector
of Mines was called
in, and as he was
dubious the House of
Dodder and Drift
reckoned it good
enough excuse for do-
ing nothing. The
chances are that the
inspector of mines is
not a specialist in
shale. If he is he
must surely be in
Tasmania for the
benefit of his health.
The Commonwealth
Government had bet-
ter now consider the
business on its own
account. At any rate,
it had better ask
George Georgeson, sec-
retary of the Metal
Exchange in Sydney,
whether the business
is worth considering.
Georgeson spent about
five years trying to
save Newnes’s Com-
monwealth Oil Cor-
poration ; and that
experience shouldn’t be wasted.
From an old political hand: —
The British Government has not asked for Hughes
or Willie Kelly or anyone else to attend the Im-
perial Conference or take a seat on the War Cabinet
or whatever it is. A representative of Australia is
requested to attend, and in the circumstances of
the moment the Commonwealth could with more
propriety and dignity be represented by the High
Commissioner than by a politician. Fisher, three
times Prime Minister, is on the spot drawing a high
salary for just such work as this, and he ought to
be earning his pay. Every week makes it plainer
that the Federal Parliament is moribund; and if
the Legislature has any respect left, the odious
intrigues of the hour will be at least partially ended
by passing a resolution directing the Government
to make use of Fisher and- hold a general election at
the earliest possible date.
Hughes formed the first branch of his
“National” Federation at Geelong and has
lately been bestowing marked attention on
the district. Locally it is believed that the
Dominating Personality will make a bid for
the Corio seat at the next elections. At
.present Corio belongs to A. T. Ozanne, a
Laborite who enlisted. When Ozanne put on
khaki A. C. Morley, a Melbourne barrister,
who was the selected Liberal candidate,
reckoned it a fair tiling to stand aside, and
he has been standing aside accordingly.
“THE LAST BRIDGE HELD, BUT”—
In Melbourne anxious inquiries are being
made as to whether baby bonuses are to be
subject to the Amusement Tax.
While Jensen, Minister for the Navy, is
proclaiming his intention to “deal firmly”
with demarcation disputes at the Cockatoo
Dockyard (Sydney), the demarcation dis-
pute between Hughes and Cook was raging-
under his nose, and Jensen’s method of deal-
ing with that consisted mostly of wondering
what was going to happen next.
William Smith, mainstay of the Yic.
Fainters’ Union, is giving Joe Hannan,
M.H.R., a friendly go for the Federal Labor
selection at Fawkner. That electorate
chiefly consists of the two State divisions,
Albert Park and Prahran. While the Park
League has long chosen ex-Premier George
Elmslie as its M.L.A., the Prahran seat has
never yet been taken by Labor, and each
election sees a different candidate put up
against sitting member Donald Mackinnon.
It thus seems possible that Smith may find
enough supporters in the uneasy east to
balance the Hannan poll in the conservative
west; so a Bill Smith may yet push a
Priminister out of Parliament. For there
still are rumors that Hughes thinks he has
as good chances in Fawkner as anywhere.
Jack Cain, who has won the Labor selec-
tion ballot for Jika Jika (Yic.), comes
from the _ Yarra Bank with the Socialist
party behind him. He did about five years’
soap-boxing for the red-rags, and then became
sedate and sat with the Northcote Council
for a term. He is now organiser and Trades
Hall delegate for the Clothing Trades Fede-
ration. Membrey, a Liberal, holds the seat
that Cain is after.
After taking the Government’s advice,
planting the specified varieties of fruits
suitable for canning, and waiting patiently
for over five years for a return, settlers in
the Vic. irrigation areas find that the can-
nery isn’t there. A few settlers got up
early and placed their peach crops with a
Melbourne jam firm at £lO a ton. The
others can merely see their crops rot. To
get a cannery going would cost from £20,000
to £BO,OOO, with the necessary advances on
stocks till the wares are placed. The
growers can’t do it, so the Water Commis-
sion should pour itself into the breach.
Dead, Robert McNab, the ihan who blazed
the track which led Maoriland to adopt com-
pulsory military service. Six or seven years
ago McNab, after losing his seat in the
House of Reps, (he was Ward’s first Min-
ister for Lands), went to England and saw
what was coming. Returning to the Wintry
Isles, and finding Parliament fumbling in
the dreary old way with Defence problems,
he started out on a crusade up and down the
country, wrote a letter once a week to The
Bulletin, converted the public, and put
backbone into the Ministry. Within a year
compulsory service was a fact. McNab'had
a long and honorable record in political life.
But it will be through his work as a student
of Maoriland’s earliest history that his name
will live longest. In this field he took first
place, sparing neither time nor money at un-
ravelling the story of a buried past. He
was the eldest son of an old-time Australian
pioneer who settled in Otago away back in
the ’so’s. A lawyer by training, he was
politician, historian and bachelor by choice,
very well provided with cash, solemn, sandy
and 54.
The secretary of the A.W.U. in S. Aus.
having written to Works Minister Lynch
asking for an inquiry into the dismissal of
J. N. Elliott, constructing superintendent on
the eastern seetion of the transcontinental
ji , T , ,
ia^ ay ’ r^“ d Ljnch ha n % answ ered “No,”
& ydne> telegraph burst out into a rig-
marole about the “excellent precedent"
established by Lynch in refusing to be brow
beaten. But the A.W.U. is as much within
its rights in requesting to have a public
question ventilated as a newspaper is. And
as the Telegraph has been several times a
week telling Lynch and the rest of the Gov-
ernment that it is a “rump” and a “rem-
nant” and ought to get out, the time seems
ripe for a Telegraph article eulogising
Lynch for refusing to be bullied by the
Telegraph and establishing an excellent
precedent by declining to take advice from
itself as a mere outsider.

We who have dreamed and dreamed we dreamed

Within the zone where Thought's grey river winds
Through groves of passion-vines and tamarinds,
Have heard some fist within the magic zone
Bang a wild gong, clanging a brazen tone;
And lo! Each drowsy dreamer wakes and finds
This idiot with a hundred million minds
And not a single mind to call his own !
Hands to mazed head the quavering madman runs;
Mumbling strange words of parliaments and kings :

Or tosses wrath from out the mouths of guns,
Or wiiii arched eyes he speaks tremendous things,
Yet grins when some comedian thumbs a nose!

NOTIONS
The prompt scratching-of Patrobas • and
Shepherd King for the Australian Cup was a protest
against the handicapper’s rating of them as being
a pound or two better than Lavendo., But it seemed
reasonable to reckon them more likely than Lavendo
to carry 9st. into first place at the end of a 2-j-mile
race. Shepherd King and Lavendo each won a Caul-
field Cup, carrying ,7st. 71b and 7st. 31b. respect-
ively, and each ran in a Melbourne Cup, carrying
Bst. 31b. and 7st. 131 b. respectively. The King
came second to the 3-year-old Sasanoff this year,
whereas Lavendo had run nowhere behind 3-year-old
Patrobas last year. Patrobas and Shepherd King
are proved stayers and look capable of being wound
up tor a long journey. The brilliant Lavendo is
not a proved stayer and he doesn’t look capable of
standing a severe preparation. To this writer there
seems nothing in the handicapping to complain of
except that Wolaroi (Bst. 41b.), taking him on His
very best form, was kindly treated.
Sticking out from the Newmarket Handi-
cap chances is Ettefred, sister to Traquette on the
maternal side.' Ettefred at 7st. 81b. is thrown in.
She won the Maribyrnong Plate 15 months ago
down the Flemington straight. She won the Caul-
field Guineas brilliantly in October last, beating
Wolaroi and Meld King. On her day Ettefred is
very fast, and the first week in March is a good
time for mares. The thing to be said against her
is that she has seemed quite untrustworthy thus far.
She is by George Frederick. Half-sister Traquette
was by Traquail-, which made all the difference in
the matter of streaking away when the barrier rose.
Still it must be admitted that a mare of Ettefred’s
occasional excellence is well in the Newmarket with
■ only 7st. 81b. to carry. Of the English horses that
are still of an improving age and are apparently
coming along nhelv, Highfield (Bst. 111 b.) and
Whitefield look likely ones. Especially Whitefield.
lie won three races out of four as a 3-year-old in
England.

The much-boomed Torch.v arrived first in
the Welter at Warwick Farm (Sydney) on Saturday
with McLachhrn aboard. Torchy is trained by the
veteran Harry Rayner. lie had been galloping well
for a long time and was solidly backed lately to
win a couple of big sprints at Randwick. He got
punctured in both. The mokes he downed on
Saturday were anything but champions and he had
only five pounds from the minimum, Bst. Still he
won well enough to justify the belief that he may
land in front again before long.
liandwick trainer Fred Williams has a
good one in the two-year-old Greenstead. The young-
ster’s first victory was at Wyong on Tuesday and the
.second at Warwick Farm on Saturday, where Green-
stead had to carry 51b. penalty. The nag is by The
'Welkin out of Tuning Fork, and last year cost 100
guineas. Greenstead went out at even-monev, and
won by fully eight lengths from Frank McGrath’s
filly Malt Maid, which was expected to do well at
the recent Randwick rdbeting, but did no better than
run prominently. In third place in this race was
Amera’s Daughter, owned and trained by W. Booth,
of Rosehill. Booth has turned out more two-year-
old winners and place-getters in the last three seasons
than most of the other trainers combined.
* * *- *
Karanaud King is a strange mixture. At
Randwick recently when expected to run well for-
ward he Was almost last. Later, he ran so well in the
Anniversary Handicap that he was one of the first to
Hit the home stretch. Right up to the distance he
looked to have a chance of at least getting a place,
but joined in with the also-rans. In the Warwick
Farm llaiidicap on Saturday the brute led practically
all the way, and lasted long enough to beat Narivo,
another disappointment, by a short head, with Willow
Green, yvho started favorite, a couple of lengths
behind. Karanaud King is the property of Jimmy
McMahon, Sydney’s biggest carrier and one-time
representative Rugby Union full-back. The writer
would sooner own the carrying outfit than Jimmy’s
moke.
At the “picnic” Lake Albert meeting
(S.A.) an event with only two starters was a cer-
tainty for one, and it was a nice point whether the
investments on the other would be enough to pay'
the machine’s commission on the lot. They were —
just; and backers of the winner - got" their money
back, without loss! The equitable machine needs
room to turn round in. Fortunately events with
two starters are not common.
This Lake Albert meeting saw some record hard
luck on the part of Allan Bowman, its principal sup-
porter. There were seven events, and he had a cut
at every one <*f them. In three of them there were
onlv two starters. The Bowman colors got six sec-
onds and a third! And Mr. Bowman himself was
taken ill and removed to hospital a day or two before.
Jockey 11. Jenkins won all five flat races
on the programme at Broken Hill last week, and
thus did a fair day’s work for several days’ pay. But
the books saw nothing to cheer about. Each nag
was a favorite.
The Australian-bred colt Biplane and a
colt named Hvmestra,. owned by J. D. Ormond, are
the star performers among the young horses racing
this season in Maoriland, Up to the present it
looks as if Hvmestra is the smartest when the
journey is short, and Biplane the better over a bit
of distance. - Biplane won the Great Northern Foal
Stakes at Auckland, six furlongs, but was beaten by
Hvmestra in the Kilburn Plate at Wellington, four
furlongs. Last week the colt won the Middle Park
Plate at Chchurch, running the distance in Imin.
13sec. Biplane is owned by J. R. Greenwood and
trained bv Richard' Mason, the most successful con-
ductor of two-vear-olds in Australasia. The argu-
ment over the pair may be settled at Easter in the
Champagne Stakes.
“Spreader”: The objection of the racing
clubs to a doubles tote is that it keens too much
money locked up while the two legs and intervening
races (if any) are being run. With only a straight-
out machine operating the club deducts a percentage
each race from practically the same monev ; but if
the thick end of the capital available is diverted to
a “double,” covering, say, four consecutive races,
then the loss , of revenue is a Very serious matter to
everyone except the people who provide the cash.
“JJI.M.”: About betting shops (B.
11/1/’l7). What a harvest they used to make out
of the ante-post betting with their “all in sys-
tem! When Fairy Gold’ (1 think it was) dropped
dead a couple of days before the Melbourne Cup a
big, husky wharf-laborer came into a shop where he
had backed the horse and demanded his money back.
The penciller tried to explain that the bet was
made “all in,” but the punter was not satisfied, and
threatened to knock the shop to splinters and pick
his teeth with them. So the clerk tried to “square
off” to him by saying how stiff his luck was, too—
that he had a fiver on a horse and it was scratched.
“Oh, scratched ?” said the aggrieved wharfie. “I
don’t mind a horse being scratched, but I’ll have no
drop dead on me.”
* * + *
In the final race-meeting of the English
season, held at Newmarket, Bob Sievier (late Sutton)
had the luck to pull off two events. The second was
a selling race on the concluding day, and he won it
at “any price” with the somewhat oddly-named
Lady Randy, by Simon Square out of Marlborough
Duchess.
It was Fred Kay and Harry Stone again
on Saturday—this time at Sydney Stadium. Henry
jumped much less than usual, mainly because leap-
ing around Kay is about as useful as bombarding
him with a mouth-organ. The trouble is to get
at him, the principal obstacles being an inconvenient
right and a left concealed in the second entrench-
ment, for when the first line has been carried the
next has a habit of springing over to where the
other was. At times Stone scored well, but his
custom of hitting with the inside of the glove took
a lot off the count. The accumulation at the end
was with the lanky riddle from the West, who still
can fool ’em all. Kay is not so much a pug as a
conundrum.
Vince Blackburn (N.S.W.) and Jack Jan-
ncse (Vic.) had another argument about the
bantam championship on Saturday. The controversy
raged at Melbourne. This time it was not Blackburn
who won, and John retired from the scene decorated
once more with the label the other youth had torn
from him at the temple in Rushcutter’s Bay. It
was an earnestly-conducted exchange of views, with
Blackburn mostly on the aggressive and the other
fellow’s left interposing. The Melbourne lad is a
fine defensive boxer, and, though he was once or
twice rattled by the onslaught, the referee took the
view that skill in this direction was entitled to more
points than was Blackburn’s system of assault.
Point scoring in boxing is a mysterious, business and
unless one understands it —which nobody does —it
was hard to see enough between these two on Satur-
day to justify a decision either way. Naturally,
therefore, victory has not brought peace in the
bantam department.
TOM WARNE. Victoria.
The lightweight championship of the
Speck was alleged to be at stake when “Snowy”
Corbett, the holder, ran foul of a gent, labelled
Rud-Kee, described as a Chow champion. Rud may
have devastated China all right, but he failed to
make much impression on Corbett, and after 20
rounds of unpleasantness, the white hope got the
verdict.

Les Darcy, glove-fighter (only), writing-
like a schoolboy from New York on January 3:
“Just a line to let you know my whereabouts. I
was sorry to have to run away like that; but you
know why I done it. I am all right on this side,
if I am all wrong on that side. I am in, bad, I
know; but why should I worry ? I reckon I am
another Houdini, don’t you? We had a lovely trip,
a bit lonely. Sixty-two days! How did -—- get
on? Did he go into camp? Poor old r!” But
all the time it’s “poor old Darcy,” the runaway.
-If Uncle Sam comes into the scrap, where
will Darcy bolt to for a fight or two in pleace and
comfort ? It almost looks as if he will' have to
pussyfoot back to Australia, as the only country on
earth where the war doesn’t matter. Anyhow, if
the U.S. does get into holds with the Kaiser, the
public thereabouts will have mighty little time for
anyone who deliberately bolted. Even as things were
when he arrived, most of the newspapers made re-
marks that were a long way from complimentary
and warned Darcy that he wasn’t the draw he would
have been had he appeared under different conditions.
The question whether a scrap could be arranged
between him and Carpeptier appeared to hinge less
on whether the Frenchman could get leave to box
in America in aid of the Red Cross funds than
whether he would consent to have anything to do
with Darcy. As events are shaping, it looks 100
to 1 that he would not, and that the Yank promoter
would hesitate about offering the Austrajian any
heavy wads.
Letters from U.S.A. say that Griffo, the
old-time Sydney lightweight boxing wonder, has been
rescued from the slums of New York and set on his
feet. A few years ago there seemed no hope for
him, but good friends stuck to him and “to-day he
looks a business man with grey hair.” He may
come this way as a music-hall turn.
“Eryander” (B. 18/1/T7) speaks as if
Sandow, with his supple muscles, was a freak. The
old idea of training was for athletes to get hard.
Men stood up with their muscles tensed while
trainers smacked ’em with hand and towels. This
“getting hard” was the accepted idea. Even cyclists
were treated so that all the waste tissue was well
rubbed and rolled out of their limbs. To-day the
system in every branch of athletics is to make all
muscles soft and pliable. When an athlete loses his
flexibility he loses his chief asset. It is the begin-
ning of the end with him.

Heavy rain, broken bridges, torn-up roads
and fallen trees were mere incidents to Alex. Jewell
and J. Walsh, who the other day drove a 45-li.p.
Studebaker Six between Sydney and Brisbane in 324
hours. The previous “best” (36 hours 50min.) was
made by Dodwell 4 and Lang in 1912. Three sets of
non-skid chains were-worn out on the journey.
The motor cyclist’s idea of carrying a dead-
weight of relative or soft, round girl on a cushion
behind his saddle keeps money in the family; but
care .should be taken that the passenger’s garments
don’t obscure the stern-light of the machine. A
Melbourne man took his father-in-law for a ride last
week, and when he was pulled up for showing no
red disc, he discovered that the danger-signal had
been hidden bv the old man’s hanging coat-tails.
Then the startled old man investigated behind him-
self and found that his tails had been burned to a
cinder.
Fanny Duraek added another champion-
ship to her costume last week by winning the N. S.
Wales 300yds. title, with 50yds. to spare from M.
Winn and M. Lovelace, in 4min. llsec. Earlier in
the week Fanny cut the 300vds. record back to 4min.
2 1-s°'’'’ b- "imping 9 3-ssec. off some figures she
created in 1913.

The long arm of coincidence elbowed its
wav into Bananaland’s 100 yards Swimming Cham-
pionship for 1917. The first two home last .year in
this race were Springfield and Pierce. Both are
now arguing the point with a bomb. This vear’s
result also reads Springfield 1, Pierce 2—young
brothers of last year’s place-getters who are keeping
the families supplied with trophies.

Tom Sullivan, oarsman, who with his son
fpught in France with the Maorilanders and was
(again with his son) made prisoner by the ITuns,
gets a quittance from Germany under an agreement
of exchange with Britain. Young Sullivan' isn’t of
the prescribed age, so he remains at Ruhleben. One
of Tom’s performances was to cut out three miles
330yds. on the Parramatta in 18min. 414 sec. That
was on .Tune 28, 1891.
“Haka”: Answered “Here!” at the roll-
call of the 24th Reinforcements, G. Smith, of
Feilding (M.L.), well-known horseman, athlete, shot
and shearer. His best performance with the tongs
is 260, and at the hop, step and jump 44ft. 9in. ;
highest leap, sft. 6.fin. Which reminds me that in
1901 another Maorilander, C. C. Laurie, won the
Australasian Championship with sft. sin. Smith was
always in great demand as a rider, and at the
last Palmerston Show steered! eight out of 14 jumpers
in one competition. His tally for the day was 296
fences without a spill.

“S.T.S.”; Have you got hold of the new
trick of. walking under water? I thought I knew
most things that can be done there, but this seems
a new principle. The man I saw simply proceeded to
the botttom of six feet of sea, and, leaning far forward,
without apparently using the hands, kicked the sand
in gigantic strides. He had no weights, and why his
head did not bob up to the surface—well, that is the
. new principle. The important point is that he
travelled faster than any swimmer, lie says he can
walk 50 yards in 17secs., and I believe it. This
thing has to be barred, or it will, where the condi-
tions in shallow water are favorable, plav up with
swimming races. And in long-distance diving how
can it be barred ?
“Yarran”: Well, put up your money.
Recently old Billy Campbell left his selection on tile
Dawson to catch the 6 p.m. train at Wallumbilla
(Q-).i distance, 40 miles ; start, 6 a.m. He arrived
in time to give a lengthy discourse, damning King,
Country and Billy Hughes for rejecting him. Age,
70-odd. There is a purse here to say that he will
walk anything of his age off the face of the earth.

Chas. Dunell Rudd, whose death is
announced, was one of the athletes of his time in
England, though he is better remembered for his
association with Cecil Rhodes in the purchase of two
quarter-shares in the De Beers diamond mines. With
this interest to work on they succeeded in bringing
about the formation of De Beers Consolidated. At
Harrow in 1862. when he was 18, Rudd won the
quarter, the mile, the hurdles and throwing the
cricket ball, At Cambridge he won the inter-Univer-
sity racquet match, and later he was one of the.
famous big-game hunters of S’Africa. He was in
the confidence of Lobengula, from whom he obtained
the land and mineral concessions for the British
South Africa Co., and among his most valued posses-
sions were the original charters, which he kept, a
memento of one of the biggest deals in which a
simple savage was ever the partv of the other part.
“Pick”: In the stage-conch days, Jack
Hurley, a noted Monaro (N.S.W.) go-as-you-please
Tied., • undertook to race the mail-coach from
Cooma to Nimitvbelle, 23 miles. He took what-
ever advantage the winding road gave for short
cuts, but the gain thus afforded was not more than
a couple of miles. When the mail rolled into
Nimitybelle Hurley was digesting his second long
beer. Bill Sang, a half-breed Chinese, reckoned that
he could eclipse Hurley bv beating the coach from
Nimitybelle to Bombala, 33 miles. He led the
way to Bibbenluke, 23 miles along the track, but
there dropped more or less dead.
“F.H.E.”: G arae is becoming short nowa-
days. I know, because me old man, who is the
best long-distance shot in the district, has to
lather his cartridges with salt to keep the game
he hits fresh.

“Jobber” : For the old-age stakes in horses
I’d like to nominate old Bob, who was bred and
owned by the late Major E. H. Weston, of The
Meadows, Albion Park (N.S.W.), one of the finest
horsemen the State has produced. The old prad was
32 when he passed the post.
* * * *
“P.F.” : What they call the black bream
in Tasmania is a good sporting fish running up to
41b. or 51b. and .fine eating. It goes to sea in the
winter, but in the summer it comes into the brackish
water of creeks and estuaries. Many of the creeks
on the coast have their mouths closed by sand-bars,
and unless there is a flood in the soring or early
summer to clear the channel the bream cannot get
in. But it’s all right this year, because the heavy
floods about Christmas broke all the sand-bars, and
there is better bream-fishing to be got than there
has been for many years.
* * * *
Adelaide’s athletes have taken the war
very seriously. Last summer there was a little
unofficial cricket; this year there is none scheduled,
and an occasional match between two corps or two
camps has all the charm oi novelty. A recent game,
Dental Corps v. Exhibition Camp, brought out two
well-known names. Arthur, for the camp, took nine
wickets for 22, but his side did not win. He had
been put on a bit too late, and Desmazures, for the
dentists, had had a big innings. He did not remain
for the drawing of stumps, but his 94 (c. and b.
Arthur) was enough to win on.
Country rowers had things nearly all'their
own way at the 79tli Hobart Regatta. The Frank-
lin Club, from the Huon, scored first in five races.
The five Hobart and suburban clubs had to be satis-
fied with three firsts. There was one competitor in
the Alexandra Sculls whose age puts him out of the
running for enlistment. This was A. F. .Sharland, a
youth of 60, who was the amateur sculling champion
of Australia 30 years ago and put up a record that
still stands. by winning the Alexandra Sculls five
years running in 1882-188 G. He finished fourth this
time, off the 30sec. mark.
Police raided the steamers following last
Saturday’s sailing race on Sydney Harbor and
arrested five men for betting on the results. Simul-
taneously on land two horse-race meetings were being
held in the metropolitan area, and the Law was
giving the glad hand to backers and layers and
having a flutter on its own. Just why it should be
moral to bet on a horse with a kid on his back and
immoral to bet on a > sailing-boat with a man at the
tiller the Law forgets to explain.
“Old Flick” : This is the original, blown-
in-the-giass way to remove obstructions in rifle
barrels. Place the barrel in a charcoal fire, turning
slowly to avoid unequal expansion. A very moderate
heat is sufficient to char the obstruction at the edges,
especially if it is an oily rag, as it is in 99 per cent,
of cases. A gentle prod with the rod will then
eject it. Cool the barrel by dabbing it with a rag
dipped in melted tallow, which will also restore the
temper. Seeing how badly Australia needs popula-
tion, the practice of blowing out obstructions can’t
be too severely condemned. I tried it once. The
breech of the rifle went skywards, and though it
happened 15 years ago it hasn’t come down yet. My
eyebrows and whiskers likewise disappeared, but I
got them back.
“Xela” : Sharks seem to be extra-hungry
this season. While the Manuka was recently doing
15 knots across the Tasman Sea a big fellow made
a snap at the distance-log trailing astern. The
lawyer succeeded in biting off about 21b. of brass
and left one of his teeth imbedded in the remaining
portion of the instrument.
“Pick”: This is the way to remove a
jambed pull-through. Fill the barrel above or
below the obstruction with kerosene and let it
soak for the night. In the morning you may push
out the lubricated rag with a ramrod or length of
thick wire, as easily as you could pass a needle
through the thirst of a camel.
The best score by any unit of an over-sea
reinforcement draft during test shooting in England
was registered the other day by Sergt. Hugo Freeth,
a Maorilander. Over seven ranges he accumulated
156 out of a possible 170, including 41 out of 45
in the frenzied effort known as “the mad minute.’’
For this performance the sergeant was grabbed front
behind and rushed off to instruct at a school of
musketry. He is quite a youngster and contracted
the shooting habit as a kid.
. Edmund Fisher, crispest of versifiers,
should re-write his famous rhymed narrative, “The
Billiard-Marker’s Yarn.” Girls have now taken
up the smoky job in London. But they won’t be
able to learn the tricks of the business in less than
two generations.

Australian novelist and explorer Mary
Gaunt has been putting in a good word for pet dogs
threatened with annihilatiofr by English food econo-
mists and other strenuous war reformers. In the
Daily Mail she deplores the “unkind fate that made
me a cheerless widow,” and rejoices that she has
found some compensation in a small Japanese pug,
“my companion and friend.” She would consider
herself “worse than Judas” if she were to pilot the
pet into the lethal chamber. On the other hand,
novelist George Moore, not being a cheerless widow,
reckons there are a million and a half of dogs in
London alone, and “some of them eat as much as
two men.” He found 37 dogs living luxuriously in
one fashionable hotel, their owners paying 3s. 6d.
per day for their board and lodging. “The dog
question goes to the very heart of things,” and
Moore would raise the tax on the brutes to £5 at
the very least.
The English girl gets a new sort of chance
these war-times. London Express (20/11/’l6) adver-
tises for “six gii'ls who can ride well, weight not
to exceed Bst. 71b., for general work in large racing
stable. Furnished cottages close to work.”
“Tvke” : My mate had had a long run of
luck with the dice, so he gave me a six and three
throws with the other two. I threw a six and five in
the first throw, and stood on that. He had one
throw and got three sixes—lB. I reckoned his luck
was good enough for a ticket in Tatt’s, so we sent
for one. The ticket turned up No. 25542 =lB
in The Metropolitan No. 2. It arrived

There is a WAY to
Perfedt Health.
L
That way is open to you. Will you travel it?
The only way to improve Nature is through NATURAL
methods.
Drugs and apparatus usually show no results and are often
injurious. Under my method 15 minutes each day in your
own room is sufficient. 1 have thousands of students in all
parts of Australia and New Zealand who are now enjoying
good health. Previously a great number of these people
were sufferers from indigestion, constipation and other dis-
orders which are the direct result of the internal muscles
being much below normal.
My exercises pay particular attention to the muscles that
govern the action of the stomach, liver and bowels, and
quickly bring them back to a healthy state again.
Surely you want to enjoy the best of health? Then why
not write to-day for full particulars of my
Postal Course of Health and Strength Culture?
This is proof of what I say:—
Dear Sir, I have practised the third set of exercises,
togi ther with the other sets, and feel stronger than ever.

Recipe to Darken Grey Hair
This Home-made Mixture Darkens Grey
Hair and Relieves Dandruff.
To a half-pint of water add :
Bay Bum loz.
Oi'lex Compound a small box
These are all simple ingredients that you
can buy from any chemist at very little cost,
and mix them yourself. Apply to the scalp
once a day for two weeks, then once every
other week until all the mixture is used.
A half-pint should be' enough to darken
the grey hair and relieve dandruff. It does
not stain the scalp, is not sticky or greasy
and does not rub off. It promotes the
growth of the hair and makes harsh hair
soft and glossy.— Advt. [4

The directors explain it this way:—
During' the year just passed the co. has been in
the unique position of having full stocks of raw
material, and consequently has been able to supply
the unprecedented increased requirements of the trade.
As at September, 1914, “stocks of merchan-
dise, materials and supplies, at cost or
under,” were valued at £94,448. Twelve
months later they were down to £89,000;
now the total is £133,074. Probably, though
it is worth £40,000 more, the stock is no
larger to-day than it was when the war
started. And that suggests a danger; for if
the war sent up prices so suddenly and seri-
ously that a large profit was made out of the
stock bought at pre-war prices, peace may
be followed by a slump so sudden and severe
that a large loss may be made out of the
stock bought at war prices. Recognising
this, many a prudent manager has a con-
tingency fund built up out of war profits to
make good what may be called peace losses.
Perhaps this co. has some such stocking
somewhere. If there isn’t a hidden stock-
ing, at any rate the one on view is swelling
visibly. Last year £33,594 was put to for-
mal reserves —net profit in excess of the 20
p.c. dividend. There is a nice little bit there
to come and go on even if it should be found
presently that some of the stock bought
during the war must be sold at below cost.
But it is a remarkable document alto-
gether. Here are half a dozen points: (1
The assets side of the balance-sheet start i
this way: “Goodwill, trade marks, t. ....e
names and processes—no value has been
placed on these or anything other than actual
tangible assets.” (2) The co. risks no
money but its own. Its total liabilities-
trade accounts—are £49,080. (3) Of the
capital of £lBO,OOO more than half is in free-
hold. and one doesn’t usually expect to have
that security and a2O p.c. dividend. (4)
Profits are so ample that the co. generously
writes 2 p.c. p.a. off buildings, as well as
from. 5 p.c. to 40 p.c. off the original cost of
plant. (5) Shares in other cos. have on sale
hitherto yielded handsome profits; never-
theless the balance of .the shares held are in-
cluded at cost. (6) In addition to the in-
vestment of half the capital in freeholds, the
co. has approximately £45,000, or one-fourtli
the capital, in cash, shares and public securi-
ties (including £15,000 war loan). It isn’t
a good thing to linger long over these
accounts without smoked glasses. Let us
get on.

Five years ago the co. had £2109 of liquid
assets in excess of liabilities. To-day it has
£9899. So it is now making very fair pro-
gress in building up a fund for the return of
capital on the expiry of the lease on which it
holds the property—3o-odd years hence. The
co.’s property isn’t all leasehold, though;
there is an adjacent freehold, with buildings,
valued altogether at about £12.000. Thus
the co. has, apart from the leasehold, about
£22,000 of assets towards the capital of
£48,000. The amounts shown as written off
go mostly towards the fund for replacing the
capital now represented by leasehold, and
are adequate. The profit is at'present cut
into pretty badly by taxes ; but there is still
a good margin over the present dividend
after providing for the depreciation of the
lease.
“Edo”: The war is made an excuse for
some extraordinary requests. Westralia’s
mining law wisely provides that mineowners
must annually supply the Minister with an
up-to-date plan of underground workings.
Every eo. of any size employs a surveyor,
who keeps adding to his plans from week to
week, and as all the Department requires is
a blue-print, it is a simple matter to provide
a copy of the plan. For small shows a
freehand dimensioned sketch is accepted.
In face of all this, the Westralian Chamber
of Mines solemnly approached the Minister
with a request to be excused for this year,
on account of the war, and the Minister
quite as solemnly granted the request. Now.
what can the war have to do with the
question? Not more than two regularly-
employed surveyors and draftsmen on
Westralian mines have enlisted. The only
conclusion to be drawn is that the Chamber
has something up its sleeve. There must be
some fairly good point to be gained by hold-
ing back the prints, and it will be interesting
to watch events. It will also be interesting
to hear what the Miners’ Union will say
on the subject, since in ease of a cave-in
causing many deaths a plan of workings is
a handy thing at the Coroner’s inquest^

Why Have Grey Hair?
When a simple, old-fashioned and harmless
recipe will correct it.
Few people know that grey hair is not a
necessary feature of age—that it can be
avoided without resorting to hair dyes A
very old. home-made remedy will turn the
hair back to a natural color in a few days.
It is only necessary to get from the chemist
two ounces of concentrate of tammalite and
mix it with three ounces of hay rum. Apply
this simple lotion to the hair for a few
nights with a small sponge and you will
soon have the pleasure of seeing the greyness
disappear. This recipe is perfectly harmless,
is neither sticky nor greasy, and has given
perfect satisfaction for many generations to
those in possession of the secret. —Advt. [4

“Tom Brown” does not fail through “simplicity,”
but because you loaded it with commonplace....
lt.T. : Verses won’t do. .. . J.L.C.: “Botanical Gar-
den Reverie” is a weariness of worn phrases and
untidy thought. ...M.M.: No Buyar: Don’t know
what it means. .. .G.L.: Clever, brutal, unprintable
stuff... .8.Z.: Not verse, but a sort of mad prose.
. ...A.H.C.: Grimy verse written with a rusty
nail dipped in so-p. Rejected.... K. A.: No use....
A.D.M.: “A Dream’’ lacks the smartness and origi-
nality that might have carried it D.W.: Not
our style; and you have a lot to learn about story
writing lan Scott: Promise in them H.R.M.:
Not up. . . ,H,J.B. : The mere drunk who only does
the ordinary drunk things is not welcome Six
and Eight: “Country cousin” is dull business....
D. McD.: Joy-column verse won’t do. .. .C.P.H.:
No. . . .F.C.8.: Very poor attempt; but glad to
know that Burns wrote “Man was made to make
his fellow-morn.” Wonder what he meant by it....
C.T.: Poor sort of “unrest” that; but interesting
to know that you go to a camp out West to find
all the joys of town. .. . W.H.M.P.: Verse is very
rough. .. .T. 0.: Subject handled already. Not much
humor in merely making AVilhelm speak bad Eng-
lish. The chances are he speaks it better than
nine out of ten of us, anyhow. .. .E. 8.: Though
you are only sweet seventeen, you might easily
write a lot better than that. . . ,M.: No, that yarn in
its new dress is no be’ter H.S.: There’s a lot
more color than that about the real rabbiter.
Piver: The next man who sends us the perfumed
goat that fainted when the Turk was led in will be
shot at dawn.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC),
CORRESPONDENTS.
Jack S.: Not a bull’s-eye in the batch. .. .R.S.
(Hobart) : Haven’t the space to criticise fully. It
isn’t worth it, anyhow G.H.T.: Nothing for us
there.... H.S.: Staring wooden figures. .. .1.M.5.:
Fuzziness won’t cover up bad drawing. .. .George
K. You labored over it, but that isn’t enough....
Hope S.: Hope on—you’re too young to do more at
present. .. .11.C*.: Very small jokes- attached to very
bad drawings. One of your war jokes is a chestnut.
. ...W.J.8.: They’re not worth anything. .. .Yalgun:
Minns knows more about the blaekfellows than your
great-grandmother ever heard of them from the man
who drove the coach.
From a tripper to Pago Pago, which is
on the way to Honolulu :
I didn’t know what a help the picture-show could
be to Civilisation till I came here. Civilisation
mostly consists of getting somebody to do things
for you, and the trouble here was to get the native
to do anything. So Civilisation sagged till the
picture-show was invented, and now the native will
work like a beaver to get enough to buy a ticket.
The show is run by the American Service Club,
which represents Civilisation ; Civilisation gets in
free, but the natives have to pay—which is to say
work. A little, while ago a variety troop visited
the island with some stirring turns and good old-
fashioned posters. The tariff, on the advice of Civili-
sation, was pushed up to a dollar and a half; and
as soon as the posters went up there was a stampede
to earn the 6s. 3d. Every native from three to a
hundred-and-ten, male or female, took to the bush
to gather copra and anything that could be cashed.
Then Civilisation knew it had made one of its mis-
takes. It ought to have recommended 10s. tickets.
It was just this way in the Garden of Eden. Civili-
sation would never have got a start if Eve hadn't
wanted a change of clothes.

IN BANANA LAND
“De Facto”: The Bulletin (18/1/’l7)
had a good word for the trucking of 5750
jumbucks from Barcaldine to Goondiwindi.
a distance of 1048 miles, with the loss of
only one wether. Well, what d’you say
about this? Recently there were trucked on
behalf of the Winchcombe-Carson Co., 9989
sheep at Aramac. They arrived at Dirran-
bandi, distant 1216 miles, three days later,
with the loss of only one wether. Upwards
of two inches <?f rain fell while this lot was
being handled. Another lot of 8855 trucked
from Aramac to Newmarket arrived at the
destination with no losses at all.
Daylight saving is rapidly assuming a
party aspect in Bananaland. The Courier
strenuously approves; the Daily Mail as
strenuously condemns; and the Labor press
is busy making capital out of it as one of
Hughes’s blackest iniquities. The sectarian
crowd will probably yet discover the trail of
the Scarlet Woman over the whole business.
Bernard Canniffe, who dragged two boys
out of the Brisbane the other day in the nick
of time, simply did it because he couldn’t
help it. He inherited the trick from his
father, Tom Canniffe, well known in the
Rivers and Harbors Department. Canniffe,
senior, has saved half a dozen persons from
drowning. About 30 years ago he did more.
At Bundaberg he went to the rescue of a
man who had been overcome by foul gas at
the bottom of a well, tied the unconscious
man to himself and brought him up to
safety.
From the Under-Sec. of Justice: —
With reference to a contributed paragraph appear-
ing in Tiie Bulletin of Ist "inst. relative to the
staff of the State Insurance Department, i am
directed to furnish you Svith the facts in regard to
the matter. The permanent staff of the Insurance
Department consists of 6.2 officers, and not 19, as
stated by your correspondent. _ Mr. Fihelly desires
that I enclose a list giving ..the names of employees,
which in itself will show how grossly inaccurate is
the statement of your correspondent.
The yarn of the former correspondent was
that “in the new Insurance Office 17 out of
a staff of 19 belong to Fihelly’s religion."
The list forwarded contains 62 names but
whether there are seven or 17 or 57 of
Fihelly’s religion among them only the Lord
knows, and He isn’t any more in-
terested than The Buixetin.
“ltan”: The timber industry is an endur-
ing argument in favor of Unification. When
Bananaland found that she had not as
much pine within easy reach as she thought,
she stopped any more going to N. S. Wales.
Annually, since then, she has been collaring,
at a royalty of 6d. per 100 ft., millions of feet
from the N. S. Wales northern rivers, though
she has far more hardwood forests locked
up than Ma has. If the forests are to be

properly managed they should go under a
Federal staff, who would not be. moved by
these petty State considerations, but act in
a jealously conservative spirit towards a
vital asset.
Billjim, junior, is living right up to the
standard set by his big brother. There is
a stretch of 23 miles between Maryborough
and Pialba, and the road is mostly gutter.
The other day two youngsters,- aged 11 and
12, set out from the first place on bikes to
cover the distance. About eight miles from
Pialba one of the back tyres blew out, so
the youngsters decided to walk. They got
the damaged tyre fixed at had a swim
and a ride round the township and started
on the return about 4 o’clock. Soon after
leaving, the same tyre began to hang out
signals of distress and the youngsters tied ti-
tree bark round the rim. About 10 miles from
home the ancient tyre decided to throw in
the sponge, and again the boys faced the
long trail, arriving home about 8 o’clock.
They had got over about 50 miles during
the day and were up in the morning in time
to milk the cows.
“Ilopbooze”: The stirring days of the
Gympie gold escort seem more recent
by reason of the death of __ Tommy
King on Frazer Island at Go. His
father was an American Civil War
veteran before he married in Ireland and
brought a family of four sons to Queensland,
where he entered the force. The boys slid
naturally into the mounted police and all
made good troopers, but Tommy’s peerless
skill has become a proverb. We were mates
in the late ’seventies when he brought off his
best job by running down Johnny Campbell
—_ a black devil who broke loose on the
Upper Burnett and acquired a German repu-
tation for murder, outrage and robbery, from
Gayndah to Gympie and Ipswich. King
picked up the nigger’s tracks near Gympie,
and after three weeks of doubling in the
coastal scrub ran him to Noosa Heads, where
his gin delivered him into the hands of a
local tribe, who handed him over to the
police. I formed one of Campbell’s escort
to Brisbane, where he was hanged, and he
told us that he had travelled in water and
walked backwards in a vain effort to throw
King off the trail. Another fine performance
was the capture of the Dora Dora murderers,
whom King and a mate tracked from New
England (N.S.W.) to Mackay. Tommy
was also a fine oarsman and had paddled in
Bananaland s champion fours.
“Shay”: “Ilopbooze,” re McCawley’s an-
pointment as judge (B. 1/2/Y7), is mentally
asquint. In the three cases successfully con-
tested before the Privy Council by McCawley,
he saved the people of Banarialand just on
£250,000. Had those cases been in ordinary
lawyers’ hands they would have made a
punch. That McCawley was receiving only
£BOO per annum makes “Hopbooze’s” case
all the weaker.
“D.J.C.” : No accounting for tastes. Re-
cently a Northern sanitary-man dashed past
the local doctor, standing admiring his
garden during the daylight-saving hour. Feel-
ing amiable that night the doctor called to
him : “Wait a moment and I’ll cut a bunch
of roses for you.” “No good to me, thanks,”
shouted the busy municipal official over his
shoulder. “I don’t like the smell of ’em.”
The Dark Bride.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No dawning’s daisies would I grow for you
Shaking the dew from their white pinafores,
With little pink lips ready for a kiss
Tiptoeing at the Morning’s open doors;
No fit bouquet for my dark bride were this!
But I would pluck you one swart bud of night,
A tulip, deep as velvet, muffled well
With heavy petals where the perfumes fold,
And the whole flower swings like a mourning bell
Above a hidden heart of molten gold. .
No tendrilled jasmines would I twine for you,
No bridal wreaths, fit for the bare brown arms
Of dancing girls; but, hidden from the glare
Of halls of pleasure, there are subtler charms
That offer ripe rewards to those who dare;
Which are betrayed by movements in the dusk,
By the hot touch of lips unseen; by eyes
Piercing warm blackness, where a limb gleams white,
A touch to dearer nakedness grown wise
Than that which postures for a caliph’s sight.
And I would fire for you a brazier
Set behind lacquered screens. No flame to pry—
Only the smoke that, rising thick and sweet,
Makes other screens; and then, for comfort, 1
Would clasp through incense your small trembling-
feet.
Or in a garden where the bulbul hides
Between knit shrubs, a hand like ivory
Parts the close leaves as breaks the sky a star.
Swift in my palms the coldness of a key
Spelling the easiest way to lift a bar!
And then the leaves will join again, as night
Joins the flat shore-line to the flatter sea ;
No rustle in the grove, no jewel’s gleam,
But in my fingers I shall hold the key
To prove, for me, it is not all a dream!
Wait till the slave has quenched the cresset’s flare,
Wait till the yawning dancing-girls go home,
Wait with short breath and loose, unlaced shoon,
Glad if the fireflies have forgot to roam,
Glad that to-night there is not any moon.
y*h.
What shall I bring you ? Bracelets made of jet ?
A storm of cloudy pearls from unlit seas?
Black diamonds priceless—steal from midnight’s heart
The ebon circlet? What were fee for these?
A linked joy the dawn must rive apart?
There are no lilies in our field of love,
Nor any daylight bloom. Yet we enclose
Within four walls a garden exquisite,
The touch apd taste of passion’s perfect rose
That only grows in darkness and in night!

Brisbane, February 3, 1917.
My Dear Tha rg om i n baii, —
This afternoon his Ex. laid the foundation
stone of the new Town Hall. In recompense
he was given a trowel. Another was handed
to the Mayor (Alderman lletherington). but
neither proposes to go into so useful a busi-
ness as bricklaying. Incidentally, the
heavens wept.
The Mayoress wore a summery silk coat
and skirt, and cast envious glances at her
husband's overalls. Mrs. Ryan, in mole-
colored taffetas, wished she had arrayed her-
self in seaboots and oilskins. Mrs. Iluxham.
in Assam silk, and Mrs. Bill Hamilton, in
a checked tweed, were the only other Minis-
terial ladies present.
H. D. Brennan ceased to be deputy Fed-
eral taxation commissioner this week and
entered on his duties as Bananaland’s Cura-
tor. On Wednesday night the staff of the
Commonwealth’s Taxation branch met at
the Cafe Majestic to farewell him.
t About £lO,OOO of tiie £21,000 which the
Y.M.C.A. needs in order to carry on its
work among our soldiers has been raised.
The Y.M.C.A. rest-huts in France and Egypt
have been an unforgettable source of com-
fort to our boys, but —well, comfort costs
money.
Two well-known squatters, W. Glasson, ot
Warkoa station, Yeulba, and Harry Winter,
of Roma, left Australia this week for Lon-
don, where they will join a motor-transport
brigade. Both are over military age. The
Queensland Club farewelled them at the
usual dinner.
Byron Watkins, one of the first science
graduates at the local Uni., is in an English
munitions factory. R. G. Quin, another of
our Uni. boys, is likewise engaged.
Killed in France, on January 1(5, Lieut.
Nugent Le Poer Trench, only son of an old
Queensland bank manager. He was on the
cable staff in Canada when he felt it was
up to him, and went away with the 29th
Vancouver battalion.
To help the Comforts Funds of the sth
Light Horse, the 9th and 49th Battalions
and the 9th F.A., a cafd is to be established

Lome MeDougall, eldest daughter of %■
McDougalls of Cooyar station, is pledged
to Henry A. R. Veness, only son of Mr.
A. A. Veness. of Glen Innes. But don’t say
a word to a soul, my dear.
Lieut.-General R. Hoskins, who has been
placed in charge of the East African cam-
paign, in succession to Gen. Smuts, who goes
to London, has had a remarkable career of
soldiering. lie began under Kitchener in
Egypt, and at the end of the S’African cam-
paign was said to be the youngest brevet-
major in the army. Between that and the
big conflagration he had a few'little border
scraps in India and Africa. In August.
1914, he went out with the first 100,000, and
fought his way up to Mons and hack to the
Marne. Then he was given an important
African command, and now has the job of
taking Germany’s last little bit of colonial
empire. He’s a cousin of “Mario,” who used
to write you this weekly letter.
Is the Railway Department in conspiracy
with the Brisbane newspapers for the pur-
pose of increasing their circulation? It is
quite common to see a passenger on a subur-
ban line haul a copy of a daily from his
pocket and spread it on the seat to protect
liis clothes from the grime. Woman, having
no convenient pocket, just has to put up
with it. As Minister Coyne proposes to
abolish dirt-money for the employees,
wouldn’t it be a fair thing to pass it on to
the passengers?
Yours affectionately.
AUSTRALIA JANE.

Miss Gladys Cooper Explains
Some Beauty Secrets.
The Popular London Star Favors Simple IVlethods.
I have been asked to give a few simple recipes that I know, either through personal
use or by observation, to be valuable to the toilet, and which are within the reach of the
average woman. In these days of £lOO facial treatments and elaborate and expensive
beautifying processes my suggestions may read like lessons in economy, but they are
not especially so intended. They are merely practical suggestions, in which the keynote
is “effectiveness.” All the materials or ingredients which 1 mention are either already
at hand in the home or may be readily procured from the chemist. Fortunately Ido not
suffer from the ailments or troubles enumerated below, but some people who are not so
fortunate have told me their experiences, and with your permission I will set forth some
remedies which they have found to be efficacious.
Home-made Hair Tonic.
My acquaintances say tliat a good stimulant
to the natural growth of the hair is boranium,
A very simple, effective and safe stimulating
lotion made up by mixing one ounce of bora-
nium with i pint of bay rum. This may be
applied to the hair roots occasionally with the
finger-tips with good results.
' Complexion Renewals.
Complexion experts advise me that a normal,
healthy complexion is constantly renewing it-
self by dropping off tiny flakes of worn-out
tissue, thus revealing the fresh young skin
underneath. They say that when this process
cleminite in four tablespoonfuls of water, or
witch-hazel, and use it as a face lotion,
smoothing the skin with the fingers until it
is dry. This method is perfectly harmless.
I am told that a really beautiful, natural, vel-
vety bloom results and remains for many hours
quite unaffected by the most trying conditions
out of doors or in the ballroom or theatre,
and that it gives a much more natural appear-
ance to some skins than does ordinary powder.
Grey Hair.
I have observed many attempts of many
people to conceal grey hair. Some of these
experiments were musing, some disastrous.
is checked by age, expo-
sure or some of many
causes, the complexion
becomes dull and ugly.
The rational treatment
recommended is to help
the skin perform the
natural f-u-n c t i o n s of
“shedding” worn-out tis-
sue. For this purpose, I
am informed, there is
nothing so good as pure
mercolized wax, used for
a few nights, just as you
would use a face cream.
It is claimed that it pos-
sesses a special affinity
for the effete scarf-skin,
which it quickly removes
by absorbing it. The face.
I am assured, will soon
look much younger and
prettier under this treat-
ment.
The Curling Iron.
Don’t use a hot iron to
curl your hair. Some of
my friends make the cun-
ningest sort of curls
Wherever they want
them simply by damp-
ing the hair with liquid
silmerine before retiring

and some were success-
ful. Personally I believe
I shall let my hair turn
when the appointed time
comes, but if I were
going to try to evade it.
f would give a trial to a
real old “grandmother”
formula that would prob-
ably do the work. This
formula. I am informed,
has been used with de-
crees of success for many
generations, and consists
merely of two ounces of
concentrate of tammalite
mixed with three ounces
of bay rum. It is ap-
plied to the grey hair
a few times with a small
sponge, and ladies tell
me it appears to darken
the hair to a natural
shade, not like a dye. but
gradually and naturally.
Miscellaneous Hints.
A few useful hints from
my friends on aids to
beauty, are as follows:
* The eyebrows and laslies
may be made to grow
stronger and darker by
applying mennaline. a
at night. When the hair is dry in the morn-
ing it will be softly curly just where you
want it to be. This method is perfectly harm-
less, even beneficial to the hair, and the curls
last a long time. The liquid is quite pleasant
and neither sticky nor greasy.
Hoav to Shampoo.
Most women, I am informed, do not know
how to use stallax properly when shampooing
with it. Unless the hair is naturally very
oily, a stallax shampoo may sometimes leave
it rather dry. But I am told if you will ap_ply
olive oil freely to your hair and scalp just
before shampooing with stallax, the result is
most delightful. The hair will be left clean,
soft, bright and wavy, the olive oil having
properly balanced the action of this wonderful
hair cleanser.
Is Powder Necessary?
A great many women object to using pow-
der, for various reasons. The following
formula is a good one: Dissolve an ounce of
specially delicate pomade, with the finger-tips
at night.
Rouge is often obvious, and many women
therefore prefer to use powdered colliandum,
which gives a most natural tint.
The lips may be prevented from drying ana
chapping by touching them with a stick
of prolactum, which also gives them a good
color. , . ,
Freckles are most effectively combated witn
ammoniated mercury creams, of which jetta-
line is the best.

THERE is something most satisfactory about
having on the right shoes for the occa-
sion in hand. One feels comfortable,
smart, confident. And for any and every
occasion nothing could be more suitable or more
charming than patent leather, which always
looks well and goes so beautifully with every
colour and every fabric. Indeed, this little
shoe here illustrated will add no small share
of smartness and tone to one's spring suit or
summer gown. And it is only one style of
many equally desirable, equally charming. For
Bostock shoes, besides being the last word in
smartness, all have a certain individuality which
sets them apart amongst ready-made shoes,
gives them the personal quality and the dis-
tinctive tone of shoes made specially to measure.

A soldier’s suggestion f
A fitting- tribute could be paid to the memory of
our gallant lads who are buried in unmarked graves
all along the path of the recent battles on the
Somme, by the erection, after the war, of some
simple column setting forth that Australians are
buried here. There are hundreds of these graves
containing the remains of from six to 20 of our .lads
who have fallen and been buried hurriedly in a
common grave. Many indeed have been buried by
shell-fire, and it is of course impossible to identify
these spots. Permission would be readily granted
by the French nation, and I'm sure the Australian
nation would as readily find the small amount of
money that would he required.
“M. 8.” : All local records of families serv-
ing in the war are beaten by that of the
Cardews of the West Country (Eng.). The
family comes from Dr. Cornelius Cardew
(1747-1831), Chaplain-in-ordinary to the'
Prince of Wales of that bad old period. Of
direct descendants of the first Cardew 116
went on service. Ten were killed, 26
wounded, three are missing and two are
prisoners. The list of honors shows one
K.C.8., one C. 8., three C.M.G., six D. 5.0.,
Two 'MX. and' 23~mentioned in despatches.
Corp. C. L. Cardew,. A.A.S.C., was one of
the first seven who enlisted for service from
N. S. Wales.
“Karee” : Just before I got what brought
me into a Middlesex hospital, one of our
“birds” came back after recovering from a
“Blighty touch” and reported that a piece of
“whiz-bang” had smashed his arm. While
he was having it dressed, another whizzer
blew him and the dresser to—wherever they
were booked for. We picked up what re-
mained of them, but as we couldn’t tell
which was which we sorted the pieces in two
equal parts, put them in two sandbags, and
buried them under their respective names,
leaving them to sort themselves out on the
Day. of Judgment. By the way, it’s a nasty
feeling to have some of your best mate
under your nails.
“Kodak” : A lad in a skiff had dared to
snap a camera at a soldier mate standing at
the rail of a transport anchored in Sydney
Harbor, and the patrol crew swooped down
and took the machine from him. The sol-
diers hooted this performance and a few of
them tossed potatoes and rubbish. The
patrolmen didn’t like it, and one of them,
taking a parcel at random from a pile in the
boat, shouted : “If you don’t stop, I’ll throw
this overboard!” The childish threat only
amused the crowd and the hoots continued.
Splash went the parcel, and the little party-
in the skiff recovered from the water some
sodden c-ake and ruined comforts and a letter
and Bible (slightly damaged). The litera-
ture was sent aboard to the owner on a
string, and ap far as I know the patrol
which throws parcels overboard when it is
annoyed is still patrolling.
Another good Australian got a bad knock
when Serg.-Major H. R. Sparks, of North
Sydney, was blown up in the trenches. He
was one of the first to enlist in N. S. Wales,
and like his friend “Teddy” Larkin, M.L.A.,
lost a brother on the memorable 25th
April, when the A.I.F. was blooded. Larkin
fell a' few paces to the left of Sparks, whose
lirother was killed on his immediate right.
For his part in Lonesome Pine he was men-
tioned in despatches. After the evacuation
Sparks went on to the Western Front, where
a “coal-box” paralysed his legs. However,
there’s a chance that he’ll recover. In the
years before the war he was a solid worker
for Labor as hon. sec. of the Willoughby
(Sydney) P.L.L.
Thus Francis Birtles, the overlanding
motorist:—
The natives were' soon adepts at cinematographic
work, and before long I had quite a corps of
“trained artists.” Eventually, when there seemed
to be no hope that help would arrive, I set out to
walk to Woologorang; but none of the blacks
would come with me, as there was going to be a
big fight on the Calvert and they all wanted to be
in it.
Black Brother’s liver is evidently of a
different complexion to that of sftme whiter-
skinned Australians.
“The Old Soldier” writes
“Croce di Malta” (B. 11/1/’l7) is not far wrong
in his estimate of the Maltese. As for their ethno-
logy, there is very little known about it. They
call themselves “Smite’.r,” and the island dialect
is a very curious mix re of all the languages
spoken round the Mediterranean. The suggested
Phoenician origin of the isl. ’ri-s is nonsense. Mostly
the language used is Italian, with a strong infusion
of the Sicilian dialect, which contains many Greek
and Arabic derivatives. Malta has had a curious
history for the last 400 years or so. Early in the
16th century Charles V., Emperor of Germany, gave
it and the other islands of the group to the knights
of St. John whom the Turks had just expelled from
Rhodes. The Order at once set about the work
it had carried on at its old home of hunting down
the Turkish and Arab pirates who infested the
eastern Mediterranean, and continued it till the
growth of national navies did the knights out of
their job. Having nothing useful to do they then
became just like other knights. It was on June 11,
1798, that Napoleon, on his way to Egypt, sailed
into Yaletta Harbor, and persuaded the representa-
tives of the Order to let him leave a garrison behind
him. But he had no sooner sailed away than the
inhabitants began to find the soldiers a nuisariec,
and got into communication with the British General
commanding in Sicily, who sent over a supply of
■ arms and a young engineer subaltern. He was
exactly 20 when he started to besiege the garrison,
and he wasn’t much older when the flag came down
! in September, 1800. That subaltern died a field-
' marshal in 1870. He was Sir John Burgoyne, the
son of that General Burgoyne who was forced to
surrender to the Yankees ait Saratoga in 1777. John
Bull was then given the islands—there are three of
[ them —and the.-' people ieejSf -never to have . regretted
it.


With old age comes inactive bowel
movement and sluggish liver. Through
weakness, nature is unable to perform
her proper functions, and requires assist-
ance ; without it there is constant suffer-
ing from constipation and its attendant
evils. Old folks should never use physics
that are harsh and irritating. With our
experience of the good l'esults that have
been obtained by the use of Chamber-
lain’s Tablets we can unhesitatingly
recommend their use in preference to any
other medicine for aged people. Cham-
berlain’s Tablets are gentle and soothing
in their action, cannot possibly produce
a disagreeable effect, and are in every
way reliable and beneficial to the whole
system.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are the ideal
medicine for children. No more nasty
medicines that you have to coax the child
to take. After they have once taken
Chamberlain’s Tablets, and realise how
easy they are to take, they will be ready
for them again. They are perfectly safe
for the youngest child and their use will
not result in constipation.
When the quantity of food taken is too
large, or the quality too rich, sour stomach
is likely to follow, and especially so if the
digestion has been weakened by constipa-
tion. Plat slowly and not too freely of
easily-digested food. Masticate the food
thoroughly. Let five hours elapse between
meals, and when you feel a fullness and
weight in the region of the stomach after
eating, take Chamberlain’s Tablets and
the sour stomach may be avoided.
“That tired feeling” is not always
caused by the weather, as some people
would have you believe. The fault
lies in some derangement of your diges-
tive organs. Your stomach is out of
order, as your liver has become sluggish
and refuses to perform its functions. All
you need is a dose or two of Chamber-
lain’s Tablets, and that feeling of weari-
ness will disappear.
Constipation brings many ailments in
its train and is the primary cause of
much sickness. Keep your bowels regu-
lar by taking Chamberlain’s Tablets,
and you will escape many ailments
which make life a misery. Constipa-
tion is a simple thing, but like many
simple things it may lead to serious con-
sequences. Nature often needs a little
assistance, and when Chamberlain’s Tab-
lets are taken at the first symptom of any
irregularity much suffering and distress
may be avoided.
DON’T blame your boy if he is at all
stupid and always at the foot of his class.
You are the stupid one, because you never
thought of his liver; that is where the
trouble lies. A sluggish liver makes a
sluggish mind. Chamberlain’s Tablets
act directly upon the liver and make you
feel bright and active.
Irritability, like headache, is evidence
of some disorder of the body, generally
either indigestion or constipation, and the
cause must be removed. To relieve the
indigestion and stimulate the bowels to a
regular natural habit take a course of
Chamberlain’s Tablets. They have a
marvellous effect on the stomach, liver
and bowels, and relieve all disorders of
these organs.
It is qnything but pleasant to awake
with a bad taste in the mouth. This
always arises from a disordered stomach
and may be corrected by taking a dose of
Chamberlain’s Tablets immediately before,
retiring. They cleanse and invigorate
the stomach, improve the digestion and
give one a relish for his food. They are
easy to take and pleasant in effect.
MILLIONS rush in mad chase of
health from one extreme of faddism to
another, when, if they would only eat
good food and keep their bowels regulated
with Chamberlain’s Tablets their trouble
would at once pass away.

Tablets -
Women and young girls are generally engaged in
sedentary work which soon leads to constipation.
Your doctor will tell you that the
primary trouble with the health of most
women and young girls is that they are
careless of the condition of their bowels.
There is nothing so important in this
regard as habit and system. The grow-
ing girl should be especially looked
after. Girls and women of all ages will
find that by regulating themselves they
can avoid the free use of cosmetics and
such things, and that obesity is reduced
by bowel elimination and weight in-
creased by proper assimilation.
For women, children and old folks,
who should not use harsh pills, salts or
other strong cathartics there is no milder
or more gentle laxative than Chamber-
lain’s Tablets for the Stomach and
Liver.
Chamberlain’s Tablets act on the
principle that by gently regulating the
bowels the digestive muscles will soon
be trained to again do their work natur-
ally and unaided. Thousands of families
use Chamberlain’s Tablets regularly and
they are the standard remedy in many
Australian homes to-day.
Give them a trial to-day. For consti-
pation, dyspepsia, biliousness, belching,
gas on the stomach, foul breath, head-
ache, bloating, etc., there is nothing
equal to
GIAMBECLAINSTABLETS
3°r the Stomach «£> Liver.
The fact that indigestion and constipa-
tion are fruitful causes of organic diseases
cannot be widely known, or these only-
too-common complaints would not be neg-
lected, as they frequently are. “It is
only indigestion” is a common remark,
and few realise that indigestion may be
termed “starvation of the body,” for food
that is not digested is not assimilated by
the blood and the body is not properly
nourished. Chamberlain’s Tablets will
relieve the most obstinate case of indi-
gestion. Many a long sufferer owes his
present good health to a course of Cham-
berlain’s Tablets.
Constipation resembles nothing so
much as the stopping of the sewerage
system of a city, and you know the out-
break of disease that would result if
this should happen. Then try to realise
the danger to yourself if you allow
your bowels to become clogged. The
poisonous matter which should pass off is
absorbed into the blood, which is the
cause of numerous diseases. When you
are troubled this way there is just one
thing to do—get a box of Chamberlain’s
Tablets. They cleanse and invigorate
the stomach and bowels, and clear the
system of all foul accumulations and re-
store it to a normal condition.
Indigestion and dyspepsia wear out
body and brain, for owing to imperfect
assimilatipn of food they do not receive
the required nourishment. Constipation
ensues and the victim becomes weak and
haggard. Chamberlain’s Tablets stimu-
late the digestive organs to perfect action,
compelling complete digestion and assimi-
lation of food, and strengthen the bowels
so that they act naturally and regularly.

BLOOD is the energiser of the system. Upon its quality
depends the nourishment of every organ, every nerve-centre,
every muscle of the body.
Poorness of Blood is called Anaemia —girls, women and men
are all subject to it.
It manifests itself in breathlessness on slight exertion, pale
cheeks, lustreless eyes, depression and exhaustion.
If you have any of these symptoms, or are run-down and need
a tonic, take Iron ‘Jelloids’ to enrich the blood.
When the blood has been enriched and strengthened, Anaemia
is overcome—the symptoms give place to abundant vitality, rosy
cheeks, and a feeling of general “fitness" and well-being.
Fr. Andrew Wilson wrote :—“ Impoverished blood can be made rich and good
by means of Iron 'fetlo ds,’ the most effective and desirable treatment."

Jabez Wright, Labor M.L.A. for Broken
Hill, and ex-undertaker, talks shop:—
“V know, I never make a speech from notes —
only give it to 'em straight off me chest. Notes
jumble me up. Same way up at Broken Hill. No
matter how many measurements I took, I kepi ’em
all in me head. If I figured it down I always got
the width and the depth mixed somehow. Once I
got the length for the coffin mixed up with the time
for the post-mortem, and the coffin was delivered a
foot short. AVhat f did I do? Had two slits cut out
of the end with a key saw and anchored a few
, wreaths to his feet.
“Plenty variety about undertaking—-different case
every time.
“Once 1 put on a man who was terribly nervous.
He seemed afraid that while he was handlin’ the
remains Gabriel might blow his horn and the
remains turn on him. A man like that would never
make a tradesman. While he was with me a man
was found dead with his chin resting on his hands,
and o’ course, when we turned him over, there he
was in a fighting attitude and not lookin’ peaceful
as he should. It would never do to torn out the
finished article that way, so I told him to put a
strain on and force the arm down straight. Well,
just as the arm was gettin’ into the right position
his hand slipped and the dead man’s fist came back
like a misfired cranking-handle and dropped him.
He had a week’s wages coinin’, but I've never seen
him since.
“Embalming? Look, if I’d lived in the days of
the Egyptian mummifiers my name would be iii the
Bible instead of Hansard. They couldn’t embalm.
They only cured and smoked ’em.
“It’s good business to always keep a- big out-size
coffin in stock. When a big remains wants anything
it wants it quick. In any case, a big ’un is handy
to sleep in. 1 slept in one for years, and a more
natural, sleep y’ couldn’t have. No draught can
get y’, and y’ can't fall out. Once there was a
plague of mosquitoes came to Broken Hill and
everyone was stung mad. They had suckers on ’em
like can-openers. .They used to come prospectin’
round me, but as soon as they got their eye on the
coffin they hauled off, as they reckoned that wasn’t
what they were after.
“One day when Lord Northcote and his eyeglass
were up there —-oh, there’s the quorum bell!”

“McNorth”: The voyage, of the barque
Inverclyde, which occupied a year from
New York to Port Adelaide (B. 14/12/TG),
is a rarity in the records of the Inver line.
These vessels, all graceful three-masted
barques built of steel, were constructed with
a special eye to speed, and they have
won many long-distance races. I was a
member of the ship’s crew when the Inver-
esk raced a steamer from the Cape of Good
Hope to Port Adelaide many years ago.
We ran well south for the easting down,
and saw nothing of the steamer till we
passed her anchored off Glenelg, near
Adelaide, waiting for a pilot. She had
beaten us by half an hour. Time, 23 days.

“F.C.”: Who says we are not making
ourselves more efficient? Here is E: L.
Strange, gardener, of Ballarat, showing how
tomatoes can be budded on a potato stem
so that the one plant produces crops of two
different vegetables. I don’t grudge Strange
his laurels, but he merely bears out a
since-disputed discovery I made years ago
that by grafting a salt bush on a pepper tree
and budding thereon a spud sucker and an
onion bulb, you reap a crop of Irish stew.
W e’ve got to balance our accounts some-
how, and as we won’t decrease our imports
we’ve got to increase our production, even
if every law of Nature is capsized in the
process.
A neutral correspondent at Cologne de-
clares that “sometimes there are great
fights outside the boot shops.” They still
have bargain-sales in Berlin, apparently.

“Marco Polo”: Apropos of the sinking
of the Itonus, “Gellibrand” (B. 11/1/T7)
is a trifle astray. Old Currie built all the
fleet except this one, which was the old
Anglia before he acquired her in the Cold
Country. . The “B” boat was the Buceph-
alus, well known here years ago. She was
sold to a Dutch crowd at Samarang and
dubbed Simongan, and if those long-suffer-
ing engines can scrape up six knots, she is
still doing something up there.
“Melb”: Another cry from Macedonia
because in the building of the new Newman
College it has been decided to furnish the
rotunda, assembly hall, gallery, library, re-
ception rooms, corridors, lecture hall, gym-
.nasium and billiard-room with Japanese
oak. Next to this foreigner, the committee
favors American white oak. Still, there are
a few Australians in Australia, wherefore
these establishments in Melbourne have been
fitted with our own incomparable timbers:
Commercial Travellers’ Club, Victorian
hardwood and Queensland maple; Mel-
bourne Steamship Co., Queensland maple;
Public Library, Queensland bean; Young
Women's Christian Association (a fine
place), Tasmanian hardwood and Aus-
tralian blackwood; Auditorium, Queens-
land maple. There are many others, but I
hand these up as the first lesson to the
enemy in our midst.

“Exile”: Last mail from U.S.A. brought
a letter headed “Institute of Efficiency, New
York,” inquiring in letters a cow could read
without spectacles, “Are you making the
most of your powers?” On the Institute’s
own mailing-card I replied: “Yes, but next
time you post me a circular about Efficiency
see your clerk puts a 5-cent stamp on it, as
I paid 6 cents for tax.

Bequest in money to requite
The country’s decent obligation.”

Are you Worried about Baby ?
HOW to feed Baby is often a great worry to
mothers who are unable to nurse their
babies themselves. Ordinary cow’s milk —
however prepared at home—is not a suitable
substitute for the mother’s milk. It is acid in
reaction, contains harmful germs and forms
dense curds in the stomach that cannot be
digested. Decide to use the ‘Allenburys’ Foods
which are the only series of Foods scientifically
adapted to the growing requirements of the
child. You will be delighted when you see
how well your baby thrives on this Method of
Infant Feeding. The ‘Allenburys’ Foods are free
from all dangerous organisms; they are portable,
being in powder form and packed in sealed tins.
The Milk Foods Nos. 1. and 2 require the addition
of hot water only to prepare them for use.

A Mother in South Australia writes:
Sirs,
“1 see by your circulars you have pamphlets on infants feeding and
management. Kindly send me one, it may prove very helpful now or
in the future. I have a beautiful boy fed on your foods since infancy,
we tried other foods (not knowing of yours) and they almost killed
him, he became so thin and old looking that I felt compelled to have
the doctor’s advice. Directly he saw the child he said he was being
starved, he was nothing but bone ; he told me to try Allen & Hanbury's
foods and see how they would_act. I did so with a marvellous result,
in a week there was a big change, he is now eleven months old and
such a big boy—not flabby fat but proportionate. He is just starting
to walk and has eight teeth so you see his illness has not made him
backward. I feel I cannot say enough for your foods and advertise
them all I can. Trusting you will send the pamphlet I asked for,”
Yours ever grateful,
Mrs. H, Pearson.
A Doctor In New Zealand writes:
Gentlemen,
“It may interest you to know- that yQur Infants Foods are largely
prescribed by us out here and are found to fulfil all they promise
to do. I find the No. i Food most invaluable. The young mother of
to-day seems quite unable to nurse her offspring.”
I am, faithfully yours,

Miss MAISIE POLLARI) (from a photo.).
REXONA.
Nothing prettier has ever been seen in
Australia than the mysterious bush scene
in “The Bunyip Pantomime’’ in which
Miss Maisie Pollard sings the haunting
refrain, “Bunyip, Bunyip, what is it?' 1
to a nestling group of Australian chil-
dren, one of whom, little Joan, left behind
on the darkening stage, repeats the query
in a baby treble to the enthralled audi-
ence. Miss Pollard loves Australia, and
hastens to praise a good Australian
article. She writes:—
“A friend of mine uses your
Rexona for her little baby—the
only son. Watching her bathing
him, and knowing how particular
she is about everything she uses for
him I asked her the name of the
Soap. That was three years ago.
Since that date I have also become
a Rexona devotee. It is a perfect
Skin Soap. It is ns fine for children
as for the hair and complexion of
grown-ups. Rexona Ointment is
equally good—it will heal any-
thing.
“Wishing Rexona the success it
deserves.
“Yours faithfully
“(Sgd.) MAISIE POLLARD."
The Rexona Remedies

are universal favorites
with everyone who
values a pure and
healthy skin. Rexona
will at once heal all
the minor injuries to
the skin, as well as
the more serious ones,
and Rexona Soap pro-
tects the user from

Of course it wasn’t necessary, you know, as we always caught

But then that meant cooking.
Well, we all voted “REX” CAMP PIE “the goods.” And now
camp cooking isn’t any trouble any more.
If you and your mates go down the Bay to a Beach get a few tins

f HE sun drooped low on rock and sand,
And also on the sea.
Matilda stroked with satin hand
The whiskered face of me.
The ocean rubbed the rugged land
With suds of surferte.
It was the world’s wide washing day;
The rain had scrubbed the trees ;
Tall branches with their coats of grey
Were hanging in the breeze.
The large cliffs standing round the bay
Were splashed about the knees.
A gentle summer steam arose,
The fishes pruned their fins.
The mermaids dipped their tender toes,
The mermen scraped their chins,
The earth’s large wash-tub seemed to close
Around‘ creation’s sins.
I said : “To-morrow will be clean,
As yesterday was fair;
To wliat a golden velvet sheen
You sandhill sleeks its hair,
While cloudy pillows softly lean
On new-made beds of air.”
Matilda’s eyes were wonder-wide,
She sat erect and tall,
The murmurous voices of the tide
Grew very faint and small,
She saw the drooping sun divide
The sea’s blue overall.
"See, see,” I cried, “the soap of dreams,
In foamy lather white,
Before the sun’s large razor gleams
To shave the sands aright,
Ere from the darkening East upstreams
The towel of the night.
“Observe,” I said, “the winds that sweep
Heaven’s second-storey flats,
See where the housemaids of the deep
Beat out'the bedroom mats”

CURSE O’ MOSES.
The Island Teacher's Wife.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE little grass-roofed house of the
Island administrator, or teacher, stood
amidst a cluster of waving, rustling
cocoanut palms 50 yards or so from high-
water mark. The clear blue water gently
lapped the clean white beach, and a line of
angry breakers marked the position of the
sheltering reef a mile to windward.
The island was one of the numerous lonely,
isolated specks that are dotted promiscuously
over the waters of Torres Strait. Away on
the western horizon the bold outline of the
Two Brothers showed faintly against the
sky, and the hazy shapes of many other
islands formed an irregular circle of varying
circumference.
A number of natives were seated on the
sand in front of the house. Some were
softly crooning a mournful, wailing chant;
others beat their bodies with the palms of
their hands, but gently and almost without
noise.
For their beloved teacher. “Matcha” Fer-
gusson, was lying sick inside the house-
sick with a fever aggravated by a scarcity of
proper medicines and invalid food; one of
the penalties paid by the good and courageous
white men and women who cheerfully accept
positions as teachers on isolated Torres
Strait islands, where there are no neighbors
and only occasional and haphazard means of
communication and transit. The beauties
and charms of tropical scene and surround-
ings pall before the dreary, monotonous
routine of teaching thick-headed niggers the
ways and virtues of the white man; and the
allegedly paternal Government that is re-
sponsible for their welfare leaves them to
shift mostly for themselves. Many are the
stories/that could be told of hardship, star-
vation, sickness and even death endured by
these brave people, whose existence is hardly
even suspected by city dwellers.
An emaciated white woman stepped
through the low doorway on to the verandah,
and, sheltering her eyes with her hand, gazed
earnestly seaward. Her eyes, bloodshot and
staring, told of long sick-bed vigils, but her
lips were pressed firmly in an effort to sup-
press all outward signs of weakness or
despair. She held up her hand to enjoin
silence.
“Do you see any boat yet, boys?” she
asked.
A big native stood up. “No, Mam,” he
answered respectfully, in good English.
“We are watching all the time. The signal-
fires are ready for lighting, but no boat has
yet come in sight. And oh, Mam,” he
asked appealingly, “is the Matcha (master)
getting better?”
The woman choked back a sob. “I don’t
know, Morto,” she said. “But let us hope
so. Tell the people to be as quiet as possi-
ble. And keep a good look-out for a lugger
or cutter to take the Matcha to Thursday
Island, where he can get doctors and medi-
cine.”
Morto raised his hand to his head in
imitation of the salute he had seen the
soldiers performing at Thursday Island,
and, taking a burning stick from a small
fire, went down to the beach, ready to make
smoke signals as soon as his keen eyes
detected a vessel.
Mrs. Fergusson tiptoed back into the dark
of the house. On a heap of mats &nd
blankets on the floor lay her husband, the
administrator of the island. He was a mere
yellow-skinned wreck with high cheek-bones
and sunken eyes. He muttered semi-deliri-
ously.
His wife knelt by his side and signed to a
native -woman to bring water.
The sick man turned his fevered eyes to
his wife.
“Any boat yet, Maggie?” he whispered.
“Not yet, dear,” she answered. “But
there is sure to be one soon. Cheer up ! All
the natives are on the lookout, and a craft
of some sort is bound to turn up soon. There
must be plenty of beehe-de-mer boats out this
fine weather, and some are sure to pass in
sight of us.” The wife spoke more bravely
than .she felt. The fine weather had lasted
for over a week, and no craft had come.
The place was too far away from the usual
pearling and beche-de-mer grounds to be
visited by any but casual or passing vessels.
She held a pannikin of water to her hus-
band's lii>s —water tepid and nauseating ;
cold water was out of the question on that
sun-blistered island.
Fergusson eagerly drained the pannikin,
and was refreshed. “Maggie,” he said in a
husky whisper, “this is a rotten life for you.
No life for any white woman. If I pass out,
you get away south and live as a decent
white woman should. This is a blackfellow’s
existence, and if the rotten Government did
its duty instead of”
“Don’t talk,” his wife interrupted. "It
only weakens you, and don’t, for goodness
sake, talk of dying. You’ll be all right in
a day or two.” She happened to glance
towards the door. “Oh. what is it Morto?”
Morto stood in the doorway impatiently
beckoning. His eyes were ablaze with sup-
pressed excitement.
“Mam, a cutter is in sight,” he said,
pointing to where the sapphire-tinted sea
showed between the boles of the cocoanut
palms. Right on the edge of the horizon
appeared a small, upright speck. At that
distance it looked about as big as a wax
match would 50ft. away.
Along the beach a dozen fires were already
sending columns of smoke at irregular in-
tervals as the natives controlled the signals
with mats.
Mrs. Fergusson went in to break the good
news to her husband.
Sam Meehan, master of the seven-ton
cutter Maori Witch, raised himself from the
hard bunk and looked long and anxiously at
the aneroid barometer hanging on the bulk-
head of the little, poky cabin.
“Somethin’s goin’ ter happen,” he mut-
tered. “We’re goin’ ter have a lump of
dirty weather soon. I’ll make a dart outer
this fer shelter. There’s too many blamed
islands and things about here fer an’ old
hooker like this with rotten gear in a nor’-
west blow.” He went up on deck, and wet-
ting a finger in his mouth held it over his
head.
“Wind’s shiftin’ already,” he said. “Iley !
you fellers for’rd there, stand by ter take a
reef in th’ mainsul.”
He took the tiller and jammed the vessel
up into the wind, while his crew of two
Binghis wrestled with the flapping canvas
and took in the reef.
Just as'all was secure, one of the boys
caught sight of the smoke signals on Fer-
gusson’s island.
‘'Boss,” he called. “You look 1 You see
singal longa island? Sumfin’ wrong! Them
feller make plenty singal.”
Captain Meehan looked at the signals.
He also looked at the barometer and the
weather horizon. He hesitated. He knew
that urgent signals are not made from an
island where there is a white man without
good cause. But what about the weather?
Grumbling and cursing to himself he
luffed up and steered for the smoke columns.
After carefully navigating the opening in
the reef, he anchored the Maori Witch close
in to the beach and went ashore.
Mrs. Fergusson met him on the beach.
“What’s up, Missus?” asked Meehan,
briefly.
Mrs, Fergusson explained. Her husband
was very -ill indeed, and in urgent need of
medical attention. He would hardly live
much longer under present conditions. Would
Captain Meehan take him to Thursday
Island? She was willing to pay anything in
reason.
Meehan didn’t hesitate.
“Get yer husband aboard at once,” lie
said, “an’ I’ll clear out to Thursday straight
away. You’ll want ter shake it up, because
there’s dirty weather cornin’, and I don’t
want ter be caught in here.” tie pointed to
the now threatening sky. “And, Missus,” he
added, “don’t yer worry yer head about
payin’. That’ll be all right.”
Carefully the sick man was carried down
to the beach and placed in the dinghy. Then
his wife stepped in with him.
“Wot!” said Meehan, “you ain’t cornin’,
are yer?”
Mrs. Fergusson looked up from placing a
pillow beneath her husband’s head.
“Of course, I am,” she replied. “Who’s
going to look after .him if I don’t go?”
- Meehan stood aghast.
“B-b-but, Missus,” he said, “it’s goin’ ter
blow like h 1 mean, like —like lianything.
You’ll die of fright. It’s a hundred miles to
Thursday, an’ this is only a dirty, stinkin’
cutter. Better stay at ’ome, Missus.. I’ll
look after ver husband.” He spoke appeal-
ingly. “Never no luck with a woman
aboard,” he muttered to himself.
But the lady stood firm, and fifteen
minutes later the Maori Witch was standing
out for the passage with the sick man in the
little cabin and his wife kneeling beside him
whispering words of comfort and telling him
all would now be well.
And Captain Meehan, steering with the
tiller between his knees, stated his belief to
the world in general that this would be a
bad-luck trip. “Never no luck with a
woman aboard,” he reasserted.
For the few remaining hours of the day
the cutter danced' through the steadily-
rising sea. Although the wind had not
freshened, a swell from the south-west,
coming at right angles to the sea, made its
presence felt. Before the sun set, in a blaze
of gloriously-colored but ominous cloud-
banks, Meehan took in the second reef of the
mainsail.
The barometer was falling steadily. The
western sky showed an inky-black patch low
down on the horizon. Despite the breeze
there was a curious, overpowering sense of
closeness and dread. Meehan saw to it that
the dinghy and galley were firmly lashed :
then he looked down the cabin hatchway and
told Mrs. Fergusson to make all movable
articles fast and hand up his oilskins.
At eight o’clock it was pitch dark, except
for the nhosphorescent flashes of the uneasy
sea,, and dead calm. The Maori Witch
rolled and pitched in the nasty cross sea, the
heavy canvas sails banged and flapped, and

■KICKED BY A HORSE
Flesh Laid Open—-Painful, Inflamed Wound
Perfectly Healed by ZAM-BUK.
THE power of Zam-Buk is nowhere more highly
appreciated than among the busy toilers on
farms, sheep and cattle stations and outback
selections, where the workers—a hundred or two
hundred miles from medical assistance—need
this unique and reliable Balm to cleanse and
“sweeten'’ their wounds, and prevent “gather-
ing,” festering, inflammation, poisoning and
disease.
It may be at the plough; in the workshop;
while splitting, fencing, branding, mustering or
shearing; or in the homestead itself—the hands
receive nasty cuts and burns, and the body and
legs painful bruises and abrasions, which require
the immediate soothing, healing, antiseptic
powers of Zam-Buk to prevent festering or
poisoning, and ensure prompt and perfect heal-
ing. ;Zam-Buk thus enables the worker to con-
tinue his work without inconvenience, or loss of
time and money.
Illustrating Zam-Buk’s pain-killing, purify-
ing properties is the case of Mr. John Bent,
of 31 Sydney Street, Collingwood, Melbourne,
who says:—“Two years ago I was kicked by a
horse on the left side of my face, the hoof
catching me near the cheek bone, laying the
flesh open and leaving a gash an inch deep.
Matter flowed from the wound, which became
very much inflamed. The side of my face
swelled to an enormous extent and the pain
was excruciating.
“Being fully aware of the sterling healing qualities of Zam-Buk, I
obtained a supply and dressed the injury with it. The effect was
marvellous, for the pain was very much subdued and the smarting and
inflammation eased, I continued the dressings with Zam-lluk, which finally
drew out all inflammation, reduced the swelling, and in a few days’ time
completely healed the wound. Zam-Buk grew beautiful, new healthy skin
over the place where the gash had been.
“We always keep a supply of Zam-Buk in our home, for it is a splendid
balm to have handy w r here there are children, w T ho are constantly hurting
and cutting themselves.”

Managing Agent: RALPH ABERCROMBY,
Denison House,
380-2 George Street, SYDNEY.
the two black boys, seated on the main
hatch, softly chanted something that sounded
like a prayer.
Half an hour later an indescribable roar-
ing announced the proximity of the storm.
Little fitful gusts of wind took the tops off
m\ e waves a ll( l wet the deck with their spray,
i hen, as though struck by a heavy cannon
shell, the little cutter reeled suddenly, stag-
gered and plunged her lee-rail under.
Meehan pushed the tiller over with all his
strength, and the cutter, now tearing through
the water with her deck slanting at an
almost impossible angle, described a sharp
semi-circle and came up close to the wind.
Biting rain was now driving down the wind
in almost horizontal streams, and big black
seas rose and threatened to engulf this
Mom that dared to defy their power.
Solid, angry masses of foaming water
swept over the vessel, taking with them parts
of the bulwarks and leaving a trail of splin-
tered deck fittings in their wake.
Down fielow, Mrs. Fergusson, working by
the dim light of the swaying kerosene lamp
that illuminated the “tell-tale” compass and,
incidentally, the cabin, secured her husband
as best she could in the coffin-like bunk.
She stopped a heavy provision-box as it
careered across the floor, and lashed it, with
other articles that threatened to break away.
The thundering seas crashed on the top of
the cabin, and here and there a stream of
water descending from the roof told of ill-
fitting joints. For two hours she knelt on
the floor beside her husband, breathing a
prayer from her white lips, while the storm
banged and crashed outside.
Suddenly there was a lull. It only lasted
a few moments, but its death-like intensity
made it seem an hour to the woman shut up
in the cabin.
Then there was a mighty crash. An extra-
large sea had sw’ept down on the cutter.
What was that? A cry? The woman stood
iq) and listened intently. The Maori Witch
was tossing and jumping about in an alto-
gether strange manner—a manner that told
the woman that the vessel was no longer
under control.
She carefully pushed back the sliding
hatch-cover of the cabin, and, watching her
chance, climbed out on deck. The mainsail
was flapping and banging in an aimless
fashion.
There was no one steering! Mrs. Fer-
gusson felt for the tiller and pushed it over.
Instantly the sails filled and the cutter
forged ahead. She felt for the tackle
attached to the tiller handle and sat down
on the wet, sloping deck with her back
against the rail, her feet propped against a
cleat and the hauling part of the steering
tackle in her hand. Something bulky moved
alongside her.
“Pull th’ tiller—-to yer—a bit —Missus!”
shouted a. voice close to her.
Mrs. Fergusson heaved a sigh of relief
and obeyed.
“Oh. Captain,” she shouted, “what’s
wrong?”
“Big sea—come —aboard —broke—me leg
—an’ me arm—against—th’ rail. Boys
over—board —l reckon. Can —yer —steer?”
“Yes, I think,” Mrs. Fergusson shouted.
She had often handled pleasure-boats in fine
weather and had some knowledge of the
working of a rudder.
“Keep her—as —she is. I’ll —tell—yer—
what —ter do. I can—hang—on—here—
all right. Get—good hold. Don’t—leggo—
that rope. Yer might—go—over—board.”
Right throughout the long night the
woman hung on to the steering-rope and
obeyed the shouted orders of the crippled
man who lay beside her in the agony of
two broken limbs. The seas roared and
thundered incessantly, and the driving rain
and spray wet her to the skin. Her hair
streamed to leeward, her flimsy dress was
torn and tattered. Weak, shivering, at
times, half-fainting from the strain of the
rope in her hands and from the buffeting,
she listened ’for, and promptly obeyed,
Meehan’s orders. Her frail form seemed so
inadequate to the task, and several times
she nearly gave in. But the thought of her
sick husband in the cabin and tiie injured
man beside her and the fact that their only
hope of safety lay in her hands steeled her.
She looked straight ahead ; for the great
black rollers, as they reared their evil heads
on the weather quarter, unnerved The
steering rope cut her hands, and she tied it
round her arm for relief. Her cramped legs
tortured her and her teeth chattered inces-
santly. But she dared not move.
At length the eastern sky showed a dull
grey light which gradually became day. But
what a shamefaced dawn! A wide expanse
of whirling, foam-topped water beneath a
canopy of leaden, sullen clouds behind which
the sun hid his face.. The wind had gone
down, however, and was now a nice sailing
breeze. Straight ahead was a cluster of
islands.
The deck of the Maori Witch was a
shambles. Her dinghy and galley were gone
and splintered woodwork and torn hatch tar-
paulins told of the fury of the storm. Of
the two black boys there was no sign*
A bedraggled figure was still steering to
the orders of Meehan. The latter lay with
bis sound arm clasped round a remaining
portion of the after rail. He raised himself
slowly and painfully into a sitting posture
and looked ahead.
“Horn Island!” he said, exultingly, point-
ing to the islands ahead. “We’ve done th’
trick, Missus! Steer for that passage there
an’ we'll be into Thursday in an hour.”
The woman altered the course as directed,
and the Maori Witch sailed down the Horn
Island passage, dodging luggers and other
craft anchored in the harbor.
Some men aboard a schooner were struck
by the appearance of the Maori Witch
and her steersman. They saw something
was wrong, and put off to her. As they
climbed aboard the woman sank forward
as she lapsed into unconsciousness.
When she awoke in the little white-walled
hospital on the beach a nurse was bending
over her.
“My husband?” she asked, weakly—“is he
all right?.”
“Sssh ! you mustn’t talk. Yes, he’s doing
nicely. Now, drink this, and go to sleep
again.”
Mrs. Fergusson sighed happily and slept.
In the men’fs ward Captain Sain Meehan,
with leg and arm in splints, gave Fergusson
and everyone else in hearing the history of
recent events. “When she come aboard,”
he concluded, “I said as ’ow there never
was no luck with a woman aboard. But,
gorstruth, if she hadn’t come with us th’
ole Maori Witch would be bumpin’ along
th’ bottom of the Strait by now. and me an’
her husband would ha’ been fish feed.”

A Terrible Thing.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HIS happened just after the coming
of six-o’clock closing, when the woe
of the publican was increased. That
really has nothing to do with the Dog Act;
but it serves, to introduce an appropriate
sense of tragedy.
Chiefly concerned were a youth and a girl.
The youth was known as the Death-adder
It is not certain that the girl was ever
christened.
The Death-adder was not nearly as
vicious as he sounds. As a matter of fact
he possessed a very keen sense of self-
preservation which kept him from aggres-
sive Christianity and the like. He hated
being hit and was the wofst lighter in his
street. But he could run and therefore sur-
vived to years of manhood. The Girl lived
in this street and used to watch him sur-
viving to years of manhood. And now he
began to cherish tender feelings towards her.
But it was done at a certain distance. The
Girl’s father possessed a terrible reputation.
The little boys believed that he filed his
teeth and that once he had killed a man for
spitting on his front fence. The Death-
adder despised the idea of enhancing this
reputation, so he avoided the father.
But manly thoughts kept coming to him,
and tumults of fierce passion surged through
his breast when he thought of her and did
not think of her father, so lie decided
to visit the Girl at her home. He chose
the evening when the man-killer was attend-
ing the Anti-Temperance rally. He made
liis way up the front path very stealthily
with a box of sweets that he had won in a
raffle. The Fates were against him. The
family dog sprang forth. The Death-adder
made him run, but the dog caught him,
winning by a trouser-leg. The Death-adder
pulled his other trouser-leg up as far as it
would go and ran swiftly home pretending
he was a harrier.
Thus it became necessary to win the con-
fidence of the dog. It was very hard to
approach the dog, which was claimed by its
owners to be a Great Dane. The dog him-
self had doubts about it, but never said any-
thing.
After a great deal of thought, the Death-
adder decided to bribe the dog with meat.
He therefore armed himself with as much
meat as he could carry externally, and met
the dog half-way. After lie had done this
for a few nights the dog began to swear by
him, and also to spring up at him and lick
his face. It was some time before the
Death-adder became used to the dog licking
him in the face. So he was now able to meet
the Girl of his desire on the doorstep. He
laid bare to her his inmost feelings, and even
displayed the part of his shirt next his
heart where he had written her name in
Indian ink. He then asked her if she
thought her father would kill him if he
sought his permission to pay her attentions.
The Girl wasn’t sure, but said she didn’t
think so.
Deriving what comfort he could from this,
the Death-adder wrote notifying the father
that he proposed seeing him on most solemn
business. Now the father had seven daugh-
ters, for he was very poor. When the Death-
added asked him if he might lay siege to the
Girl’s heart,, the father burst into tears and
said “Yes, please.” So he did so.
The lovers determined to celebrate the
occasion properly on the next Saturday,
which was a very hot day. They girded up
their loins, etc., and took themselves to
Sandringham. The dog went with them,
and the Death-adder also took his mixed-
bathing tent, which had two compartments.
He went into one compartment, and the Girl
went into the other. The Death-adder hung
his trousers outside so that they would know
which were their proper places. Then the
two spent a most delightful afternoon, with
about two thousand others. So long did they
tarry on the bosom of the mighty deep that
the Dog missed them and lifted up his voice
with dolor. Those near called him a b—
mong. Nevertheless, he cantered round the
tent until he caught sight of the Death-
adder’s trousers. He was struck by a light-
ning thought. Perceiving that the Death-
adder had gone and forgotten his trousers,
he decided to return them to their last place
of abode. He seized them as he blushed to
remember he had done once before, and made
his way homewards.
Some time afterwards the two lovers
shivered into their tent. Suddenly the
Death-adder discovered that his trousers
were gone. He wept aloud and wailed, “I
am undone.” To which the Girl replied,
“Well, so am I.” He completed his toilet as
far as possible, but not quite down to the
knees. Now the Death-adder had very
peculiar legs, and the Girl’s attention was
turned to them, and it was a great blow
to her. Still, her love triumphed, and she
built a castle of sand round him up to his
waistcoat.
When night fell they formed a scheme for
reaching home without arrest. They tore
the Death-adder’s shirt into strips, and wind-
ing them up his legs after the manner of
puttees they incorporated these strips with
his coat. The effect was startling. They
walked home, of course, and arrived about
two hours after the advent of the Death-
adder's trousers had created a profound sen-
sation. The very worst w T as feared, and the
Girl’s father prepared a piece of heavy wood
with a nail sticking out of it. Such was
their reception.
When he saw the piece of wood with the
nail in it, the Death-adder became very
eloquent. He spoke with great power, and
averted a scandal. He was greatly relieved
when the father announced that he would
not kill him this time, but he was warned off
the premises. Neither did the father yield
up the trousers, for they were not a bad fit.
