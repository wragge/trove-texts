Love and Art.
“The Natural Philosophy of Love,"
by Remy de Gournont.
(Boni & Livewright, New York,)
This remarkable book might easily nave
degenerated into the common pseudo-seient.fic
pornography with which reviewers are too
familiar, but is saved from that fate by its
genuine philosophic outlook. For his argu-
ment De Gourmont is forced to review the
general phenomena of love throughout the
animal kingdom; although much of this is
merely disgusting, it is treated with due seri-
ousness. De Gourmont comes to the con-
clusion that there is no practice, however
nightmarish, which is not customary and
apparently beautiful in the eyes of some
animal, and that Nature neither allows
thoughts of morality nor decency to inter-
fere with her sole purpose—the perpetuation
of species. But the real interest of the book
is in its thoughts concerning Art and Beauty,
those eternal puzzles to mankind.
A living creature is simply an intelligence
served by organs appropriate to its needs;
and between instinct and reason there is
little difference. They are stages of the same
thing. This creature has its tyrant—its ner-
vo”S system; and as the species progresses
in evolution that tyrant makes further de-
mands upon the organs which Nature has
provided for its needs. No idea of superi-
ority or inferiority enters into the question ;
the sole end of Nature is that life shall live
to beget life. Mankind is apt to suppose
that the organs evolved by Nature are per-
fect. Not so ; usually they are exceedingly
imperfect, and any good mechanic could de-
sign aii apparatus which would be better for
the purposes of Nature than that which has
been evolved by that most stupid of all
abstractions.
Compared to other nervous systems that
of man is monstrous, nightmarish, a chim-
a-ra, but there is no reason to suppose that
having _ evolved that terror, evolution lias
ceased its work. There are many candidates
for humanity which we do not yet perceive.
Perhaps some saurian with its five-fingered
feet; perhaps some bird, with its rudimentary
sense of art and its exquisite mechanical
skill in nest-making; perhaps some monkey,
with its five-fingered hands and its quick
intelligence. So far, the saurians have de-
veloped no other signs of greatness; the art
of the birds is still most primitive; and the
monkey uses its clever hands mainly for
catching fleas. Yet who can tell? Some of
these creatures may make a sudden leap in
evolution, and our remote descendants may
wake up some morning to find that a new
chimfiera is already in possession of human-
ity’s field. The old idea was that man is
man because he has hands; but it is more
probable that man is man because he has
the wit to use the hands with which Nature
has provided him.
His inexorable tyrant, his nervous system,
has compelled man to invent additions to his
hands, such as the lathe and the plough, the
telephone and the motor-car. That chimsera-
brain of his was not satisfied with its hands
and their work. It desired luxury in the
widest sense, from cooked food to Atlantic
liners—luxury being anything beyond nuts
and an absolute struggle with wild beasts for
food and life. Similarly, it has not been
satisfied with the ordinary delights of love,
but has driven man to attempt to idealise
them ; to sing them in poetry; to find beauty
in gestures which, to begin with, were the
merest sexual instinct shared with the hum-
blest insect, the lowliest nematode. From
religion has come prudery which, in this
view, might he considered the only unnatural
vice; from clothes has come modesty. A
nude woman instinctively assumes the char-
acteristic “modesty-attitude” of the Venus de
Medici, and that attitude is, of course, the
attitude of Fear!
Taken all round, the senses of woman are
less acute than those of man. We do not
need the thousands of scientific experiments
to prove what is common knowledge. A
woman can enjoy a cup of tea which would
scald a man, and women seem to love the
dentist’s chair. Consequently, according to
De Gourmont, woman’s sexual feelings are
also less acute than man’s—a point which
the Homeric gods investigated with unpre-
cise empiricism. Occasionally a woman’s may
be the stronger; we then shut her up in a
lunatic asylum, or a King Henry VIII. mar-
ries her and cuts off her head. It is in
consequence of their generally weaker sexual
feelings that few women are rarely great in
the world of Art. There is no female Shak-
speare Or Beethoven or Michelangelo. Poetry,
beauty, music, chivalry—even literature—are
simply versions of that terrible necessity to
perpetuate the species under which all crea-
tures have to live: they are products of that
chimsera-brain which nothing can satisfy.
Of course, no individual artists are considered
in this scientific generalisation—or dream.
For the drone, marriage is certain death ;
yet the swaggering fellow rushes upon his
fate. And there is a good deal of truth in
the gibe that marriage for an old man is
merely a pleasant way of committing suicide.
Desire, both in the drone and the ancient,
leads but to the grave; so near akin are
love and death.
The translation, by Ezra Pound, is not
good. The word “specie” means, in Eng-
lish, “coin.” It is not the singular of
“species.” You cannot turn a French name
into an English bv merely adding an Eng-
lish termination. The innumerable zoologi-
cal names should have either' been rendered
into English or into Latin. Possibly Mr.
Pound’s freaks are merely American; one
sometimes wonders whether Columbus really
did benefit the world.
East and West
Is it not a fine thing, as the Irish Players
were fond of saying, to be a man of letters,
and he turning every stranger he would be
meeting along the roads into bread and
broth? Men of letters are like that. E. V.
Lucas made a tour of the world the other
day, and no doubt paid every penny of his
st,onmer fare through writing his pleasant
observations. Somerset. Maugham recently
visited the South Pacific and enshrined the
experience in his finest book. This time he
has been to China, and “On a Chinese
Screen” (William Heinemann), which sells
at half-a-guinea, is the result.
Maugham is almost a literary surprise.
He has been known for a long time as a
writer of successful comedies and of some
good sensational work. But he was never
more than second-rate, until he threw his
Island experiences at the world in “The
Trembling of a Leaf” —a work which immedi-
ately set him amongst the few- first-class
short-story writers that England has pro-
duced. These tales had the magic of color
and a sense of characterisation that rang
true. One, “Rain,” which has appeared also
in “Georgian Stories,” was brilliant and ter-
rible, and all the others were on a high
level.
These new stories and sketches will neither
add to nor detract from this reputation. His
pictures of China itself and^its inhabitants
are pleasant without being remarkable, and
the reader turns with a feeling of relief to
those of Europeans in China. These tales
are bitterly delightful and delightfully bitter.
The lady who transforms the temple into the
replica of a room in Tunbridge Wells is
inimitable, and the dinner parties make good
reading. Here is the author in the rble of
social satirist: —*
His unconventionality was exquisitely conventional.
Everything about him was according to standard,
from his square-toed, serviceable boots to his rather'
long, untidy hair. He wore a loose, low collar that
showed a thick neck and loose, somewhat shabby
but well-nut clothes. His language was often
obscene, not because his mind was impure, but
because bis bent was democratic.... He drank beer
(not in fact, but in the spirit), with Mr. Chesterton,
and walked the Sussex downs with Mr, Hilaire
Bellocr. He looked upon Mr. Bernard Shaw as a
little out of date, but he had still great hopes of
Mr. Granville Barker. He wrote nigged poems about
prostitutes, 4 dogs, lamp-posts, Magdalen College,
public houses and country vicarages... .At the club
they thought him rather a wild fellow.
Maugham encounters missionaries often, but
apparently most of those who go to China to
pray remain to scoff. They look after them-
selves too well, and are utterly out of sym-
pathy with the Chinese whom they are
attempting to Christianise. 'He seems to
think that the Roman Catholic missionaries
are the only ones who are inspired by the
true fervor. “The Stranger,” a tale of Christ
looking for the missions, is powerful in the
extreme, while the “Servants of God” is a
clever comparison of two types of zeal.
Of the Chinese sketches, “The Philosopher”
is the best, and some impressions of ’ricksliaw-
men and Chinese inns are pleasant. But
when every junior reporter has had his tale
of Chinatown printed, we shall have had a
sufficiency of jade and Chinese color. Every
scrap of Chinese scenery seems to remind
this writer of Heidelberg or Kentish hop-
fields. Though he meets a profusion of
poets and philosophers, two short poems only
are reproduced. It is pleasa"nt to .think
that they are authentic Chinese work, as in
form and in sentiment they are infinitely
superior to the Alfred Noyes-and-water that
Arthur Waley serves up. Here is one: —
You loved me not; your voice was sweet;
Your eyes were full of laughter; your hands were
tender.
And then you loved me; your voice was bitter;
Your eyes were full of tears; your hands were cruel.
Sad, sad that love should make you
Unlovable.

Henry Lawson
Being in Europe when Henry Lawson died
I could not earlier throw my sprig of rose-
mary on his grave.
Though it was not always easy, he and I
got along pretty well together, notwithstand-
ing that I handled practically all his MS.
in the later years of his life. Most of his
“copy” was rough, written in a schoolboy's
unformed hand, and ill-spelled where one
might least expect it. And it was not
because it was dashed off with Bedford’s
impetuosity; on the contrary, Lawson wrote
and re-wrote, and he would turn up with
“corrections” for a month after anything in
prose or verse had been handed in. He
would come in reciting a couplet or a whole
verse that one had not heard before: it
might be weeks before he toilsomely produced
the thing of which it formed part. Even
then, as often as not, there were missing
lines to be dropped in later; but to set
against that there were usually some alter-
native readings.
So far as his prose was concerned few
waiters have owed more to their editors. In
them Lawson was singularly fortunate—
until his later years, at any rate. J. F.
Archibald, an incomparable sub-editor and a
man of infinite patience when he had in
front of him a MS. which he cherished, did
not grudge the hours he spent in preparing
Lawson for market; and A. G. Stephens
greatly aided and abetted him in those days.
Simultaneously and for years after-wards he
had to deal with James Edmond, who en-
couraged his contributor to mix more quiet
bush humor with his tragedy. Often at a
first reading it was difficult to make out
what Lawson was driving at; yet you felt
the stuff was there —phrases caught the eye
and ear at once. He was a photographic
genius, with a lens that picked up and regis-
tered the smallest details, and he presented
them in such a way that you realised how
they illuminated human nature: another
man wouldn’t have dared record such ap-
parent. trivialities. But he had a poor idea
of composition : knew little of arrangement
and less of what ought; to be left out. In
his later years particularly he nursed many
grievances, real and imaginary, and he
wanted to give them an airing in the most
inappropriate places. Nobody would have
been as hurt as he if he had seen these out-
bursts in print. He could hardly mention
women without a diatribe. His own mar-
ried life had been unhappy; and I don’t
think he could have been happier with any
other partner—or made her happier. Cer-
tainly a woman must have been dumb to
have pleased him at all. Yet, he was most
chivalrous in his‘own way. I watched him
once in his favorite haunt in George-street
North. Either the two beers which were all
he could safely manage in a. day had been
exceeded, or one had chased the other too

rapidly, and Henry was very unsteady—very
unsteady indeed —when he came upon three
young sailors making horseplay with their
obviously “elevated” donahs: they were
wearing the girls’ hats, I remember.
Henry thudded the pavement with his suck —
the only possession he could be utterly de-
pended upon to retain —and with flashing
eyes (those eyes were his most striking
feature) he reproved the seamen for degiad-
the women by making so publ c an exhibi-
tion of their, “and my,” infirmity. On that
beat every policeman knew him, ard regarded
it as one of his bounden duties to see the.
poet safely on his way home. Perhaps the
story has already been retold of the only
known occasion when a mistake was made,
and the apparently incapable was led to the
watch-house. There the young constable
had opportunity to inspect his capture. “My
Gord,” he exclaimed in horror to the ser-
geant, “I’ve taken the bloke whose picture’s
in the Art Gallery”—referring to Longstaff’s
fine portrait; the one in which, to please
Henrv, fie painted in beautiful white shirt-
cuffs, and in the cause of Art painted them
out again as soon as the sitter could be got
rid of.
How much of his impatience and the
other causes of bis occasional urhappiimss
were due to his deafness 1 don’t know; but
I suspect that it was responsible for a good
deal. It had a queer influence, too, upon
his verse as he wrote it. He hadn’t been
blessed (or otherwise) with much school
education, and there were thousands of
words wh'ch he had never heard; and h's
guesses at their pronunciation led him into
errors in metre and rhyme—the latter more
rarely. That with his handicap he did not
make more was due to his diligent though
erratic reading of the poets.
He had heard that I w r as leaving Aus-
tralia at the end of the year, ard be came
to see me the day before I sailed. “So
you’re going away?” he said. “Well, that’s
the end of mo”—and* he went on to explain
why. I said what I suppose one would
usually sav in such circumstances. “No,”
he said, “it’s no good.” Then, after a pause:
“I’m a bit afraid of you—you’re so damned
serious when you talk to me—you ard
George Robertson” (Angus and Robertson
were his Australian book-publisher's)
“that when I give you a premise and don’t
keep it I’m ashamed of mvself the next day.”
Poor Henry! I’m afraid he had often to
be ashamed of himself. But there ouvht to
be. no stone com : ng from us on that account.
One of the big-hearted women who devoted
much time to keeping him on the straight
path hit the mark in one sentence: “If
Henry wasn’t what he is we shouldn’t have
the work he has done.” He did the suffer-
ing: we got the fruits. Nobody that Aus-
tralia has produced has, in particular, writ-
ten with such understandibg of Australian
mateshin; and I don’t know any other whose
work can give you so many lumps in the
throat.

On Certain Literary Lapses
If we look w.dely upon our past history
we may d.&uiigu.bn lnue ana tnere an era
which may be uiaracienseu by its prevail-
ing tone as a material, an aistneLc, a religi-
ous, a rational age, clearly enough denned
at its point of highest development, and
separated rrom others by longer or shorter
per.ods of transition. It seems to me that
we are at present involved in the flurry of
a scientific period, during whicii men have
been impatient of any appeal not made
directly tnrough the incelLgence. hinder tins
influence readers of poetry look for ideas
only and are inchned to belittle such matters
as beauty of form and the haunt.ng music
of cunningly chosen woids. Jt>ut just as
man’s physical body may be affected through
various senses, so his spiritual nature has
more tbah one means of perception, and it
is in vain to address but one. The starved
appetite of longing will continue to crave'
satisfaction, and must in the end be appeased.
L)unng the last veur or two i have been
exploring a certain field _of Australasian
verse, and it was the critical reading of
some thousands of poems which induced
these general reflections. Alter three
months’ experience it became apparent that
they might be grouped under three head-
ings : First, those which were excellent both
in matter and manner; second, those tech-
nically irreproachable but weak in content;
third, those in which beautiful or striking
ideas were imperfectly set forth. From the
various imperfections which flawed the latter
groups two were of such frequent occurrence
that I accepted them as typical; and in
drawing attention to them I want, if pos-
sible, to make it plain that they are real
defects, not mere personal antipathies. One
is inconsequence of thought, an intellectual
lapse which is perceived as soon as the
attention is focussed upon it. The other is
more common because more subtle, and more
subtle because its ready detection is partly
instinctive. Nevertheless I hone to show
that the objection to it is also partly intel-
lectual, and therefore mav be upheld by
the use of nure reason. Oscar Wilde once
said that “in the case of noetry, as in the
case of the other arts, what may appear
to be merely technicalities of method are in
their essence sp r.tual, not mechanical.” Tlrs
statement, I believe to be profoundly true;
and the truth which is in it is a complete
just’fication of my argument. Unfortunately,
while ideas may be readily conveyed from
one intelligence to another, intuitions have
no such ordered commerce, and remain for
the greater part individual, inviolable and
incommunicable. Here are some examples
of the faults mentioned.
(a) One of the most delightful odes in
English literature is flawed by a serious
lapse of the former k'pd. The poem cons'sts
of five stanzas, of winch (it would seem)
three were wr ; tten in a first impulse, and
two added subseouently. The poet was
successful in recapturing the mood, but not
the vis’on; for whereas Autumn was origi-
nally seen as an old man—
I saw old Autumn in the misty morn
Stand shadowless like Silence, l'-t-cing
To Silence, for no lonely bird world sing
Into his hollow ear from woods forlorn—
yet this person : ficat ? on is ent ; rely forgotten
in stanza four, and another substituted with-
out any discoverable reason—
But here the Autumn melancholy dwells
And sigha her tearful spells
Amongst the sunless shadows of the plain....
O go and sit with her, a d be o’ershaded
Under the languid downfall of her hair.
Though purpos.ng to deal chiefly with Aus-
tralian poems, I could not refrain from first
instancing this, because it is the most po.g-
nant example of inconsequence I am able to
recall. The unusual beauty of all other
details blinds the sensitive reader to the
pitfall before him, and after he has fallen in,
the hurt remains as a last.ng memory.
(b) The next is a descript.on of sunset
on the Australian coast—
The gloomy rolh rs for a moment show
Upon t'leir b<living green reflected back
The sullen crimson of the cloudy wrack,
Driven by the strong south-wester to and fro.
In this case the author has failed to control
his technic; the tail has wagged the dog;
the exigency of rime has betrayed him into
carelessness of statement: for it is manifest
that a south-wester can blow in one direction
only.
fc > From a eulogy of Lord Hawke, the
famous admiral, I extract the following—
Great sea-dog, fighter in the great rid way!
What though... .thy keels were clogged with foul
decay,
Yet through the roari - g months thy squadron lay,
A watch-dog eager at the throat of Brest.
Let us pass over the unfortunate phrase “at
the throat of Brest” (wli.ch is scarcely less
embarrass.ng than would have been “at the
breast of Throat”) to dwell upon the typical
weakness herein exemplified, viz., inconse-
ouence of thought. At the outset Hawke is
“a great sea-dog,” and presumably his men
are sea-dogs, too: lesser does, it may be, but
not on that account to be denied their doggi-
ness. Later, we find that the squadron is
also a dog—a “watch-dog.” By this time
we may not be convinced that there are
“dogs with.n dogs” as there are “wheels
within wheels”; but of this we are sure—
that, whatever fortune befel Hawke off the
French coast in 1759, a worthy Australian
poet was hopelessly fogbound (or dogbound)
in the year of grace 1915.
I have already stated that the second
poet'eal misdemeanor, viz., the use of words
within - the line wh.ch conflict with the ter-
minals, may be attacked on purely rational
grounds ; and I should like to show this by
argument before giving specific examples.
Words may be considered with regard to
their sound merely, and apart altogether
from their siern'fication : that is to say. they
may be studied for their musical quality ;
and the knowledge and practice of this sen-
suous effect is an important part of the
poet’s craft. Swinburne had the melodic
gift, and occasionally sacrificed intellectual
substance for it. Lamb, on the Contrary,
had “no ear”; his charm lav in his humor,
an intellectual ouakty. There are those
readers of poetry, and writers too, whose
hearing is most acute; who can d'stinguish
sounds at a great distance, or catch the faint
cry of a startled bat: who, nevertheless, are
dea f to nmet’es of ™ns’enl expression. Such
persons may possibly deem the difference
between “j nale” and “jangle” no great mat-
ter, yet be ready to admit that, where sensi-
tiveness to such impress'ons is an ascer-
tained factor the whole battery of musical
devices mav be considered worthy a crafts-
man’s study, and a jarring note an aesthete
offence.
The chief weapons in this battery are rime,
assonance and dissonance, all of wh'cb de-
pend for their effect upon the li eness of
words to one another. This links them to-
gether in the consciousness of the reader
or hearer, provided they are not separated
by too great an interval. Of r'me there are
two sorts: head-r'me and end-rime. The
former was the only kind used in enrlv Eng-
lish poetry, generally at fixed intervals, to
re'nforce accent; or, adopting Coventry Pat-
more’s term, as “time-beaters.” Afterwards
it was supplanted by end-rime as a regular
device; but it is still employed for special
effects under the name Of
Head-r'me is present when the paired syl-
labies begin with a vowel (any vowel) or
w'th a s’milnr consonant; that is to say,
phonetically similar, the ha”d c bmrg equiva-
lent to k. for example. Should these =yl-
lab'es contain identical vowel-sounds pre-
ceded by dissimilar consonants and followed
(if at all) by like consonants, the result
is end-rime. In assonance the vowels are
al'ke, but consonants both preceding fol-
lowing must d : ffer. For dissonarce the con-
ditions are reversed; consonants before ard
after must be identical, and the stressed
vowels contrasted. Thus the pa'r “ma’d-
made” is none of these, but a unison, for-
-'n tenglish nroc-odv, though as : *Mme'
riche” it is permitted in French. “M"id-
mother” is ancient rime, or alliteration.
“Ma’d-jade” is end-rime, or modern rime.
“Maid-sage” is assonance; “maid-mode” is
d : ssonauc e . As the two last-named are rt
so famil'ar as rime, X give a stanza to illus-
trate the use of each: —
(a) Assonance.
summer wind has massed upon t’leir fW-is •
The rain has purged their hearthstones and made
smooth iheir floors ;
Low in the v’llev lie t'leir broken spears
And the white bones which are their tale forlorn.
(b) Dissonance.
I shell be hotter off with pla- ts that share
M-r° peaceably the meadow and the shower;
Soldiers may grow a soul when t”rned to fronds,
Bi t here the thing's best left at home with friends.
These like-sounding words, or “j'ngles,” as
M’lton called them, serve a practical end in
starzaic definition. Take the following
stanza :
Home they bro”g’'t her warrior dead;
She nor swooned nor uttered cry;
All her maidens watching said,
“She must weep or she will die!”
This is defined by the recurrence of rime as
an “alternately-rimed euatrain.” Suppose
we re-Write it so as to eliminate the rime:
Deed they brought her warrior home,
Yet she neither cried, nor swooned ;
Whispered ,-11 her maide s then.
“She will die urless she weep!”
Nothing now remnius to separate the quat-
rains from one another ard the poem becomes
continuous. The length of the lines, how-
ever, is st'll eVarlv marked by catalex ; s. a
sPenee eoual ( : n this case) to one syllable
at the erd of But let us t”ke another
stanza, or, rather, part of a long one:
She, as her carol sndder g’-p\v,
Vrom. brow and bo-oni slowlv down
Through resv toper fin'-pro drew
' r e l' f t and right, and made appear
Stil! lighted in a silver shrine,
Her m'Vuvholv eves divire.
The home of woe without a tear.
Here there is no catalexis, and more than
once the sense of a 1 ne runs without pause
into the next; so that if we banish rime not
only will the stanza disappear, but what re-
ma.ns may easily escape detection as verse,
The reader, then, having accepted rime as
a guide to stanzaic definition, is confused by
anything which conflicts with it and blurs
the outline. Thus it is that a “jingle” be-
comes a “jangle,” and the poet convicted of
an error in craftsmanship.
Glancing rapidly through one or two Aus-
tralian anthologies. I noted such of these
s .lee.sms as caught my ear. There were 38
of them in all, of whieb 21 were assonances,
nine rimes, lour un.sons and four disso-
nances. The most disconcerting were the uni-
sons, of which I shall quote two:—
fa) As if the dread stir had aroused f.om sleep
Weird spirits cloistered in yon cavy steep
(On which in Hie g.im past some Cain’s offence
Hath haply outraged Heaven), who, rising thence,
Wrapped In boding vapors, laughed agiin

Second in destructiveness were the inner
rimes, of which I shall give three without
comment:—
(а) And sweetly raised that old. old hymn of praise,
(б) Not till he brings it breaks the Spring.
(c) Bracken aglow with sunset by the track.
Tlien come tbe assonances. These are very
common, and vary through every degree of
demerit according to the stress laid upon
the syllable in which they occur:—
(a) Those lovely hazel eyes ’ again, with their old
haunting look,
That lithe light form, one dainty foot drawn
backward from the brook.
Surely it is a dull ear that does not baulk
at the assonance “foot-brook”!
( b ) Along the wild and wreck-strewn paths I wind,
(c) And Life's dire dread of death whose mortal
threat. . ,
Dissonances are not so readily noticed, as
the likeness is only in the consonants. Yet
they may spoil a line when used improperly,
as for instance:
(а) So it befit .a man I’ll make no moan.
(б) Lights of new heavens gleamed in her lustrous
kair,
Freedom her diadem.
(c) He sows broadcast among us bread.

parts of an iiitfilli o ible scheme, but pie dis-
turb Dg when they occur as mere inadver-
tences.
At this point, perhaps, one might be led
to think that onlv Australian noets neglected
! t f g 1
such details of composit on ; so I lay open
tile very heart s-eore of British poesy, the
“best of the best,” Palgrave’s “Golden Trea-
sury.” Presently I come upon this :
Whilst far-off lowing herds are heard—

criticism, Jet him Co JJ^^ r the following ex-
tract from William Sharp s “Sonnets of the
Nineteenth Century.” Speaking of Lord
Ilanmer’s “Winter” which begins:—
To the short davs, and the great vault of shade,
he remarks: “This interesting and poet ; e
experiment would have been still better but
f L r the musical flaw in the first line” (days-
shade). And, again, concerning Keats’ son-
nets, “With all his love for the beauty of
isolated poetic lines—music condensed into
a n epigram more concise than the Greeks ever
uttered —as, for example, his own splendid
verse:—
There is a budding morrow in midnight,
and with all that sense of verbal melody
which he manifested so remarkably in his
odes, it is strange that in his sonnets he
should so often be at fault in true harmony,
Even the beautiful examples wh'ch are in-
eluded in this anthology afford instances of
this, as in ‘Ailsa Rock,’ where the penulti-
mate word of the ninth line and the penulti-
mate word of the tenth (not forming part
0 f the rhvme-sound, tile two terminals indeed
being antagonistic) are identical': as in the
‘Khun Marbles,’ where ‘weak’ midway in
the first line lias an unpleasant assonantal
relation with ‘sleep,’ the terminal of the
second line: as in ‘Homer,’ where, after
t he beautiful eleventh line already quoted,
ending in ‘midnight,’ there succeeds ‘sight’
midway in the twelfth. These are genuine
d scords, and those who are unable to perceive
them simply prove their deficiency in ear.”
And, if o^]jqlie ev ;dence counts for anything.
then the marked and nearly always success-
ful avoidance of these errors throughout
Milton’s works must be as convincing as an
explicit avowal.
No, this criticism is not “niggling”; it
is, on the contrary, fair, and even neces-
snr.v. We do not go twice to a
barber who hacks our chins; it is the busi-
ness of a tailor to fashion a suit of clothes
having a definite relation to the figure of
the wearer; a gardener should be acquainted
with the different sorts of plants, the soils
and climates best suited to their constitu-
tion and habits, and all details necessary to
their successful cultivation. And, similarly,
it is not too much to ask that a writer shall
be master of his job. When we say that a
poet is born, not made, we mean that he
is born with the poet'c vision. But the right
use 0 f this faculty is an art, and must be
acquired. And if a man loves his art he
w Hi strive continually to excel in it, nor
will the smallest detail be beneath his care.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Riddle of Corn.
The rain is pecking at the house
As a sparrow pecks at corn;
And out of the earth, brown as a mouse,
A blade of green is born.
And I would know why the grasses breed
At the yellow season’s will,
With a clear voice in every seed
While all the stars are still.
A seed of corn is true to bread
Till harvests all are done —
Shall the good thought in a man’s head
Be light to his own son?
Or shall the word of the mind’s grace
Shine far in a cold sky—
A gleam upon the midnight’s face—
To watch its children die?
N.S.W.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
The Green Chasm.
I saw a chasm from a far mountain height
All steeped in shadowy greens—a fearsome
place,
From which in agony I hid my face,
As a man dying fears to look on light.
For suddenly Within my mortal sight
The ledge on which I stood spread out in
space,
And ordered gardens I could plainly trace
Stretching away to lose themselves in night.
From my grey platform deeper down I peered.
Eternity were not more dark to me
Than that fell vale, nor Heaven more shin-
ing fair
Than the rich realm above the thing I feared.
And as I stood one whispered wendfully
“Is God the deeps or heights? Think, but
beware!”
N.S.W.
ZORA CROSS.
Not Understood.
Loud in its swinging rhythm goes
The music from the gallery,
Where flute and fiddle lend swift toes
The wings of subtle ecstasy.
The little satyr feels his heart
Leap to the music where he stands
In the gay moonlight all apart,
His poor pipe in his conquered hands—
Silk to his goat-hair: aye, this vast
And gorgeous crowd with sword and lac?
To naked dances... .“All is past,”
He thinks, and wrinkles up his face.
No! Up the terraces he leaps,
Pauses before the open door,
Then hears each hoof, though soft he creeps,
Rat-tat upon the oaken floor.
Into the ballroom. All grows mute.
The dancers stop and turn to see,
Save one blind player whose low flute
Sobs through the silence wistfully,
A moment, till it dies away.
The frightened satyr tries to smile,
And say he wishes to he gay
Like them, again, a little while.
They do not heed: they draw their blades,
And turn towards h ; m. but he flees,
Longing once mere for forest glades
And for the friendly touch of trees.
The fluttered ladles chatter: soon
The music strikes the dance again....
A little satyr to the nmon.
Raises his arms and weeps in pain.
N.S.W,
JACK LINDSAY.
Earth-bound.
Think! was the earth-light sweet to Froser-
plna drawn into darkness?
Did the death-pale, beautiful face of
Eurydice, yearn to the Day?
Had they not carried their garlands to
temples fronting the morning,
Laughed in the markets, and lingered in
meadows where sheCp were astray ?
Ah, the dews on the grasses, the odors of
orchards and pine-woods, .. ...
The waft of a wind-blown fire, doves’
wings, and the milk-smell of kine,
The pleasure of sleeping and waking, the
mutual thorn of desire,
That strikes to the Heart like an arrow,
and quickens the blood into wine!
Dearer you are, O dear Earth, than the life
you have given and nourished.
Lo! we are held like the stag in a net Of
a myriad strands —
Blossoms and odors and dews and the mur-
mur of waters and branches,
And morning and nieht overcome us, lay-
ing hold on our love as with hands.
Did the glooms and the splendors of Hell
and the pitiless arms of its Master
Deliver the daughter of Ceres from fetters
of sunshine and rain?
Did the dreaming Elvsian lawns assuage
Eurydice’s longing
For the salt of the sea and of tears, for the
roses of passion and pain?
Do they stand at the doors unseen, all
those who have slept with the lilies —
Who are mingled and mixed with the dust
like the leafage and crown of dead
springs?
Do the violets sweeten our woods where wan-
ders the Argive Helen?
Does the shadow of Saonho pass where a
wood-bird suddenly sings?
Oh, to return l : ke a dream that escapes from
the meshes of slumber!
To look on the faces of flowers and hear
the insatiate sea!
To touch, and to hold, and to mingle quid?
] ; r»s —to he sti'erdv enfolded—
To cast baek mv head and discover in your
eyes the image of me!

THE DULL SEASON AT CANBERRA.
In the N.S.W. loan estimates, covering the
spacious sum of £10,250,000, there were
two striking omissions. No mention was
made of any money for a line to connect
any inland district with any port save Syd-
ney, and the 32 miles of State railway re-
quired to join up the Melbourne-Sydney line
with the Federal capital territory at Can-
berra remains a dream. The attitude of
N.S.W. politicians towards Canberra is
mixed. About the intense desirability of the
place, and the crass folly, not to say crimi-
nality, of suggesting that the always empty
metropolis should be moved to some other
part of the State or to some other State, they
are unanimous. At the same time they hold
that if any one from the south or west is
fool enough to want to go to such a hole he
can do the extra 117 miles circuit (57 miles
from Yass to Goulburn, change there to the
rickety branch train, and 60 miles back to
Queanbeyan), and good enough for him. Or
else lie can plod 32 miles by road from Yass
to the Federal border, and serve him right.
When Dooley was Premier he uttered a
howl of scorn when the little work was asked
for, and said he had other things to do with
the' £14,000,000 he had borrowed. Dooley’s
successor is too polite to howl, but he also
can find money for almost anything else than
giving access to Canberra. Even when the
line is built, if it ever is, Canberra, lying
away from main railways, and main roads,
and navigable water whether fresh or salt,
will be in a backwash. It will be approached
from the west by a small branch train, and
anybody who has got out at Byrock to find
the branch track to Brewarrina must re-
member what a N.S.W. branch horsebox
can be. On the west it will be reached by
an old-established branch calamity—-the
Goulburn-Bombala track, which has been in-
solvent from birth. At Yass (population
2506), to the west, the Sign will read:
“Change here for the only hamlet that ever
was the capital of a whole continent, speak-
ing one language and under one flag.” At
Queanbeyan (population 1824), to the east,
the placard will proclaim : “Change here for
the metropolis of the greatest Federation,
save one, south of the equator, and the third
biggest on earth.” Both at Yass and Quean-
beyan trains have a habit of arriving aiter
dark or at dim, corpse-like hours in the
morning. The time-tables show that, and
many a stiffened traveller knows it, The last
census showed a population of 2057 at Can-
berra, and 515 more in the detached
fragment of Jervis Bay. But 518
of the inhabitants of the big piece of
metropolis were at Duntroon. where the mili-
tary college is, and that seems to leave a
civil population of 1530 for about 910 square
miles (one to about 375 acres). The place
was accused of having 1921 ordinary indus-
trious inhabitants when it was taken over
in 1911, before Duntroon existed, and before
the officials poured in, and before f 1.107.170
was expended on it. The revenue was less
in 1921 than in 1919, and ran to not quite
£36 per square mile, which isn’t much as
c'ties go. It doesn’t even radiate any great
benefit upon the two adjacent railway towns
which minister to its humble wants, and
drag its commerce to and fro. They gained
between them 920 new inhabitants in the
10 years from one census to another.
* * * #
This doesn’t signify by any means that
Australia has weakened in its craving for
a few monster cities. With all their empty
spaces—about the biggest empty spaces on
earth barring ice deserts and sand deserts—
yawning for inhabitants, the Australians re-
main the most “citified” folk on earth.
Despite the oceans of loan money spent
(largely in the cities) to promote settlement
(in the country), and despite our alleged
manifest destiny as primary producers and
purveyors of raw materials for the “teeming
millions” of Europe, the census revealed that
in four out of the five mainland States the
number of people dwelling in the capital
city alone, is greater than that of the entire
rural population—agricultural, pastoral,
kitchen-gardening, bee-keeping, cow-keeping,
hen-keep'ng and odd sorts, also job lots.
Some details follow: —

The few unaccounted for are the migrants
—the nomads who are rural, in name at
least, to-day and Woolloomooloo to-morrow.
But, however great the Australian’s crav-
ing to dwell in a metropolis, Canberra
attracts him not one w T hit. The explanation
is obvious enough. Consciously or sub-
consciously, everybody who is interested de-
picts Canberra as a tearsome spot during the
period of its annual closing up, which may
cover four to seven months of the year,
when Parliament is shut, wdien members and
their attendants have departed, and when
the bulk of what local Public Service there
may be has moved to this or that big city,
because Ministers have supplementary offices
in the big cities, and can take the seat of
Government about with them, and hold
Cabinet meetings, as they do now, wherever
a quorum is gathered together. The “hostel”
will be wholly or partly closed—members
and others are to be provided with doss-
accommodation in a Government “hostel,”
because Canberra, as a half-time shop, isn’t
expected to have ordinary private hotels like
an ordinary natural place, or at least it
isn’t expected to have them at an ordinary
natural tariff. Shops will close or work
with reduced staffs during the dead time,
and looking up the great avenue —the pride
and glory of the city—at a quiet hour one
will sight a very old man and a middle-aged
dog. The place is situated, like Robertson
or Kangaroo Valley or Cowpasture, all in
the same State, but, especially like Cowpas-
ture, between two lines of traffic, if the
dead-end railway from Joppa Junction to
Bombala is a line of traffic, and on the direct
route of neither. Trade is not expected to
leave the main railway at Yass, where it is
within 197 miles of Sydney, and travel 191
miles, by a line that is partly State and part
Federal, through the capital to Jervis Bay,
where the Commonwealth hasn’t enough
water frontage to make much of a port. For
lack of coal, iron, water power and conveni-
ent markets Canberra has no manufacturing
ambitions. The case of Washington, also
founded as a purely political capital, is fre-
quently quoted in justification. But Wash-
ington is on the Potomac, not far from
where it ambles into the sea, instead of
140 miles distant: its position has made
it quite a large railway centre, and it has
industries to live on. Though the Federal
area is only one-fifteenth the size of Can-
berra the “Statesman’s Year Book” reports:
The district has considerable industries.... The
capital invested in such industries amounted to
63,808,179 dollars. The salaried officials, superin-
tendents, managers and clerks numbered 3104, and
the average number of wage-earners employed was
10.482.... The. output was valued at 68,826,570
dollars.
All that, with 47 local banks, trust com-
panies, etc., on a"*- Federal capital area
smaller than the municipality of Shell-
harbor (N.S.W.) saves Washington-b.v-the
Potomac from being a city that lives wholly
on politics, and a deserted city, like “Sweet
Auburn, loveliest village of the plain,” when
politics are off. It is not likely that the
great Federal departments will have more
than nominal headquarters at Canberra. The
real business will be done at the big perma-
nent centres of population. Even the Com-
monwealth Bank isn’t likely to reside there
except in name. Huge financial inst tut pns,
with ramifications in Europe ’ and America,
don t Bang out in real earnest at places
which are so much like old Cowpasture.
Canberra in the off season is likely to suggest,
save for discrepancies of climate, an Alpine
pleasure resort when winter is on, and the
population is gone, and stray bears come
and look through the hotel windows; a
Scotch watering-place in December; a worn-
out goldfield, or Micawßek waiting for
something to turn up. A poor sort of spot,
fated from birth, evidently, to suffer from
the death-and-resurrection habit, Canberra
might be appropriately re-named Lazarus-
ville.
THE LAST OF THE DICTATORSHIPS.
The fall of Hugbesism is an omen of radical
changes in the running of the Common-
wealth Bank. Which, seemingly, accounts
for a brisk outbreak of propaganda in sup-
port of the institution which has been so
kind to the architectural Kirkpatricks, and
so contemptuous of politicians who sought
information on the subject of Kirkpatrick
contracts. Lavish write-ups and advertise-
ments, in which the Kirkpatricks are not
mentioned, are appearing in the Sydney
press. And the res.dents of Brisbane have
been regaled with items like the following:
The Brisbane City Council has adopted a scheme
of improvements involving a loan of £1,000,000.
“W nen consulted about the matter,” said the Mayor,
Aid. Diddams, “Mr. Denison Miller, Governor of
the Commomvealtn Bank, stated that he saw no
difficulty in accommodating the council for the
loan on favorable terms, and incidentally en-
dorsed its hnuncial policy. this loan and the
methods it is adopting will enable the council to
reduce its overdraft.”—.lt is understood that Mr.
Denison Miller has indicated his intention to bring
interest down very considerably in the near future.
It is also believed that he strongly favors the policy
whith has been adopted by the Brisbane City Coun-
cil, and no council which his bank flna rices will be
allowed to use ordinaiy revenue for capital expendi-
ture. The works policy of the Brisbane City Coun-
cil has now been fixed for five years at least from loan
expenditure, without dipping into .revenue.
“Without dipping into revenue” is an intri-
guing phrase, it sounds magnificent, and
the operation it refers to passes in Australia
for finance, lntr.gu.ng, also, is the state-
ment that councils financed by Mr. Denison
Miller s bank will not be allowed to “use
ord.nary revenue for capital expenditure.”
This paper would like to know how
many of these councils there are,
where they are situated, and whether
any of them has really committed
tne crime of paying for a pick-and-shovel
job out of revenue when the bill m.ght have
been transmitted to th'e k.d. If any local
body has been guilty of this extraordinary
conduct it deserves to be dragged into the
light.
* * # *
The report of Mr. Denison Miller’s
enthusiasm for the grandiose Brisbane pro-
posals has a familiar appearance. It recalls
that similar transports were attributed to
him wheu the extension of Moore-street was
being discussed in Sydney. On that occasion
the Sun remarked :
By 14 votes to 7 the aldermen of the City
Council decided last night [Sept. 13, 1920] to pro-
ceed with the si heme'of resumptions for the extension
of Moore-street to Macquarie-street, and to retain
J. and H. G. Kirkpatrick, architects, to act in a
supervisory capacity at a fee of £40,000.
Alderman llagon said that the scheme... .would
cost £1,000,000, and that the rate of interest would
be 8 to 9 p.c.
Alderman Meagher said that Mr. Denison Miller.
Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, was strongly
in favor of the scheme, and would help to finance
it.
Unfortunately for the Kirkpatricks, with
whom a certain young Miller is associ-
ated, the thing fell through, and they d.dn’t
get their £40,000. However, they collected
£48,950 in respect of the war-service homes
—concerning which the PubLc Accounts
Committee observes that “the Common-
wealth Bank claimed, and was conceded, the
right” to butt m ahead of the existing build-
ing organisations, albeit “no responsibility
was carried by the Bank or its architects,”
the Kirkpatrlcks—and, in accordance with
the policy of discarding all other architects,
even where plans have been prepared by
Government officials and adopted by the
Public Works Committee, other fat commis-
sions have been secured for them by the
Bank. There is nothing to show that they
will be employed in connection with the
Brisbane scheme, which provides, among
other things, for the extension of the Roma-
street markets, the utilising of land at the
intersection of Mary, Eagle and Market
streets, the widening of several other streets
and the formation of at least one new
thoroughfare. On the other hand, there is
nothing to show that they won’t be so em-
ployed. Certainly they are not barred from
putting in for the architectural work, and
in the past they have had truly astonishing
luck.
* * * *
Whether it is in the highest interests of
the Commonwealth that the funds at the
Bank’s disposal, or so large a part of them,
should be devoted to increasing the grandeur
of the B.g Cities is another pair of sleeves.
That is one of the questions that will have
to be considered by the new Parliament
early in its career. Others, equally relevant,
concern the disposition of the Bank’s profits,
one-half of which may be legally appropri-
ated to the War sinking fund, the exaction
of £6516 p.a. for providing the Priminister
and other functionaries with suites of
rooms in the Sydney building, the manage-
ment’s habit of propelling itself into, vio-
lently controversial matters like. the North-
South railway and the unification of
gauges (to say nothing of the war-service
homes) and the continuance or otherwise of the
banking dictatorship set up by Hughes—-a
regime in which powers without parallel
in any other part of the English-speaking
world are entrusted to one man. As re-
gards the profits, on which rivers of lauda-
tory ink are spilt by tame propagandists,
it has been suggested, by Pratten, M.H.R.,
among others, that they were to a large
extent the fruits of operations on unexpended
loan balances; meaning that improvident
Treasurers borrowed with their heads down
at 5i or 6 per cent, and let the Bank have
the use of what they didn’t want for six or
twelve months at nominal rates of interest
or none at all. In which case the Bank marie
its profits at the country’s expense; indeed,
the “profits” may have been considerably
less than the losses. The point will have
to be cleared up when the institution comes
under review. And there is, of course, the
unexplained case of the Kirkpatricks and
their uncanny skill in landing contracts,
apropos of which Dr. Maxoney, M.P., gave
notice of the subjoined motion last session :
That in view of the pronounced favoritism of
those Who possess the gift of distribution of public
works —(1) This House declares that all architec-
tural plahs, designs, specifications, etc., of all works
for the Commonwealth Government and the Com-
monwealth Bank, the estimated cost of which
amounts to £3OOO and upwards, shall be thrown
open to the public competition of the architects of
Australia. (2) Contingent upon this motion being
carried, it be an instruction to the Government to
bring in amending legislation so as to control the
policy of the governor of the Commonwealth Bank
in allotting architectural work and the like to one
firm.
But Hughes was impatient to go to the
country, being boisterously confident of the
reception that awaited his pathetic crowd.
For that reason, along with the Govern*
ment’s odd reluctance to discuss the bank*
ing dictatorship or any phase thereof,
Maloney’s motion was ignored. It will be
restored to the notice-paper as soon as Par-
liament gets into its stride. The Doctor
will see to that. lie is a pertinacious little
legislator, and the Kirkpatrick business
has got on his nerves.
IN WHITE ELEPHANT LAND.
Every elephant, however valuable and meri-
torious, is white within the meaning of the
Act if it is put to no use which will enable
it to earn its board and lodging. And that
is exactly what is wrong with the White
Elephant Land which has Darwin for its
capital. This sage reflection is partly in-'
spired by the fact that the North Australian
White Settlement Association, which hangs
out its patriotic shingle at 12 O’Connell-
street, Sydney, held a meeting the other day.
Also, there is a proposal (it is only a pro-
posal and a vague one at that) to re-open,
in 192 J/, the great Darwin meatworks, which
collapsed in 1919, and that sort of progress is
slow enough to give the darkest elephant time
to bleach. Then a sluggish Federal committee
of tortoises, with the slowest turtle in the
chair, has inquired into the question of build-
ing the South-to-North railway, which re-
quired no inquiry, partly because the Com-
monwealth is pledged to the work and has
taken payment for it in land, and partly be-
cause it is too late in the day to raise a
doubt as to whether the railway is a recog-
nised means of locomotion and settlement.
This body eventually recommended the work,
and said that the one and only transcontinen-
tal, which has been talked off with bated
breath till people thought it represented the
pnce of another great war, could be finished
on the standard gauge for a little over
£2,000,000. It is about the sum which the
single State of N. S. Wales now spends in
six months on lines that don’t bridge one
continent and don’t furnish a short road to
two others, and don’t join two seas, but just
take their purposeless route into the wilder-
ness and as purposelessly stop. The work
could be done free of debt if the baby bonus
were diverted to the purpose for a mere five
years. And the Hughes Government, which
has run up the cost of Federal administra-
tion, quite apart from war charges, from
10 to 20 millions per annum inside eight
years, should be able to economise the total
amount in other ways inside one year. But
nothing is likely to happen. The Territory
has no votes, and the Prime Minister is pre-
eminently a political engineer. If Hughes
had been Columbus, it has been said, he
would have refused to discover America be-
cause the local niggers weren’t on the roll.
* * * *
The bogus case against the alleged White
Elephant Land is largely the invention of
State politicians who think that all the
money the Commonwealth has to spare should
be spent in their various States, and regard
the expenditure of Federal coin on the de-
velopment of a huge Federal property as
sinful waste. Of this order was Forrest,
who worked such a big oracle that the Com-
monwealth spent nearly £7,000,000 on a
56iin.-gauge coastal line through his prize
desert (1051 miles, with no fresh water all
the way), and then, but not till then, wasted
less than one-tenth of the amount on a futile
patch of narrow gauge in its own property
(54 miles, ending at a big river). But
despite neglect and misgovernment, the
White Elephant is a land of promise. Its
unfinished railway, 200 miles long, certainly
doesn’t pay working expenses, but rich old
N. S. Wales has 29 railways, 11051 miles
long and mostly finished and apparently at
the end of their possibilities, which don’t
pay expenses either. The shortage on North-
ern Territory railway expenses during the
last year for which figures seem to be avail-
able ' was £21,527, or £IOB per mile. N. S.
Wales has one much smaller line (Demon-
drille-Blayney) which last to
pay its mere expense account by £77,552, and
that was a loss, over and above total loss of
interest, of £7OO per mile. N. S. Wales has
one little line (Clyde-Carlingford) which is
capable of losing all the interest on its cost
and £1645 per mile per annum to boot. The
Northern Territory railway, always quoted
by anti-Federalists and Southern parochial-
ists as a prize failure and a horrid example,
seems to have exhibited a total deficit (in-
terest and working expenses) of £82,700 or
so (£414 per mile) during the last available
year. N. S. Wales has one line of about
half the length which lost £139,708 gross
last year, or £1264 per mile, and it has
1105 J miles of route which makes an average
loss of £446 per mile. These are mostly
quite finished works, and some of them are
so old that their future appears to be used
up, yet they don’t compare at all well with
the little road in White Elephant Land,
which never had a chance because funds ran
short, and it came to a stop at an antheap.
But it is only when the past is considered
that it is possible to understand what might
have been if the Commonwealth had merely
subsidised the South-to-North railway, and
left it to be completed and controlled by the
old South Australian management. In 1910,
which was the last complete year under Adel-
aide State management, the working expenses
were £12,442. which figured out at Bs. 2-ld.
per train mile run. and the isolated little
system (146 miles) failed to pay working
expenses by a mere £IBB. In 1916, after
which year the opening of an additional 54
miles of track spoiled the complete symmetry
of the comparison, the working expenses were


£47,953, w’hich represented ISs. 4d. per train
mile run, and the revenue was short of work-
ing expenses by £16,435. The only case
at all resembling this was in the Federal c-api-
tal territory, where the same Government
contrived, in the same year, to run its trains
at a cost of £1 10s. 4d. per train mile, as
compared with South Australia’s record of
ss. 6d. It v’as a Hughes Government, of
course, which piled up the wonderful expense
figures, for it has been the miserable luck of
the Northern Territory that, with the excep-
tion of one year of Joseph Cook, it has never
been free of Hughes since it became Federal
property. Whethe-r in the heated land be-
hind Darwin or in bleak Canberra, where 14
degrees below freezing-point have been re-
corded, Hughes’s capacity for piling up
expenses never varies, and* his w’aste is as
reliable as the sunrise. But while these two
Federal lines were spending 30s. 4d. and 18s.
4d. respectively per train mile, the Port
Augusta-Oodnadatta route, owned by the
Commonw'ealth but managed for it by the
S.A. Government, wms being run at a charge
of 6s. 10£d. Hughes, and more Hughes,
and too much Hughes have wrecked a fair
prospect. On the evidence the Northern Ter-
ritory is a better place for railway-building
and settlement and “development” (it is im-
possible to get away from that w’ord) than
N. S. Wales itself. But, like Papua, it is
under direct Hughes control, and it has been
used as a Home for Political Incurables, also
Improbables and Impossibles and parasites
and experiments, till it is weary of its own
existence. All the time there is nothing in-
lierently wrong with White Elephant Land,
Elephantiasis of the civil service is its worst
trouble. If the rest of Australia had also
been governed bv telegram sent by a buzzy
little Welshman from some place two or three
thousand miles away, it might have been the
same—or worse. "
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Last Bid for Power.
The electors, gave none of the parties a man-
date to govern last month. However, on
two points they expressed themselves very
definitely: they intimated that they wanted
neither Labor" nor Hughesism. Labor has
taken the hint, and instead of dreaming of
impossibilities it is considering how it may
deodorise itself sufficiently to be fit for office
next time an opportunity offers. But W.
M. Hughes is evidently incorrigible. He
has involved practically the whole of his
Parliamentary following in ruin, and, after
bolting from Bendigo, to one of the safest
Tory; seats in the Commonwealth, he' has
emerged, a technical winner, it is true, but
short by some 5000 votes. of the support
which would have . been accorded to any
reasonably , reputable anti-Labor candidate.
And now his press-propagandists are print-
ing this kind of thing:—
Mr. Hughes’s closest supporters are gradually be-
coming more and more incensed with Dr. Earle
Page for his stand against the Prime Minister, The
consequence is that when the Prime Minister comes
to meet his colleagues at a full party meeting in
Melbourne there will be a very strong feeling that
the party should- express its deepest confidence in
Mr. Hughes. It is considered that this will be done,
and in quite an overwhelming way. Mr. Hughes
will no doubt form a Ministry. The next step after
completing the Ministry would. be for Mr. Hughes
to meet the House. Labor would presumably move
a vote of want of confidence —and it would lie with
the Country party either to put the Nationalists
out, or to vote with the Government, aud make Mr.
Hughes’s position safe. If they took the former
course all Nationalists would turn round and declare
that- -they had. sided with , the Labor and Socialistic
party to wreck a constitutional Government.
There- is only one section which has the
faintest desire- to see Mr. Hughes Prime
Minister again, namely, the section which ex-
pects to get something out of him as Prime
Minister. It is relatively small, but the
people will be rash if they hold it iu any
way cheaply. It comprises the interests
which provided his £25,000; a herd of
wealthy title- and concession -seekers, and
the huge official army which has profited
from Hughesism ever since the World War
began; This influential combination may be
depended on to fight hard for the preserva-
tion of the regime which means so much
to it. Most men in W. M. Hughes’s posi-
tion would shrink from reaching after the
Prime Ministership. But he has never been
troubled with delicacy in political mat-
ters. He proved during the war by his
administration of the War Precautions Act,
and after it by his attitude towards the
salary steal, that the opinion of the people
who are supposed to be his masters is t\a
last consideration that sways him. If he
can bluff Earle Page into the belief that
the voice of Parliamentary anti-Labor issues
from Bamford and one or two others, and
that those outside Parliament would sooner
see him Prime Minister again than face the
expense of another election, then the specu-
lators, here and in London, who put up his
£25,000, may get a run for their money after
all. But if Earle Page allows himself to
be taken in by such transparent humbug he
will pay for it, and his party with him.
The electors naturally do not want another
election, but they recognise that the expendi-
ture of another £60.000, or twice or thrice
that sum, would be a bagatelle compared with
the cost of a further spell of Hughesism.
Ruined Names.
The time is evidently ripe for Toryism in
N. S. Wales to adopt a new alias. In the
last 20 years or so it has discredited as
many high-sounding cognomens as one of
those usurers who, born, say, Moses Israel,
begins business as Spencer, and becomes
successively Mordaunt, Dudley, Fitzurse
and PiANTAGENET. When Federation
arrived those who now call themselves
Nationalists were Freetraders. That is to
say, they described themselves as such, be-
cause a Freetrader was still a reputable
thing to be, at any rate, in England, though,
in point of fact, the doctrine they advocated
was in no sense Freetrade. Freetrade be-
came a term of reproach early in the century
—largely owing to the humbugs who were
most prominently identified with it—and
George Reid, when he reached out for office
in the summer of 1906, raised the banner of
Anti-Socialism. Here, again, it seemed as
though the Tories had chosen well. If the
policy of Watson, Fisher and W. M.
Hughes was anything like the S. M. Herald
said it was; if these Labor leaders stood for
irreligion, immorality, disloyalty to the
Empire and anarchy, then any section which
opposed them would necessarily be admir-
able. The title Anti-Socialist might have
been as honored in those days as the title
Protestant was when Alva was ravaging the
Low Countries, but Anti-Socialism was
rooted in fraud. The Laborites were not
guilty of the fantastic ideals attributed to
them. The electors soon saw through Anti-
Socialism, and it became necessary for the
S. M. Herald party to east about for
a new disguise. Anti-Socialism—almost
entirely a N. S. Wales inspiration—
became merged in Victorian Liberalism, and
almost immediately this fine old name, which
had been associated with so much that was
splendid in British politics, began to assume
the familiar fish-like odor. During all this
time the name Nationalism had been disre-
garded. Abroad it stood for self-Oetei'm.na-
tion—the aspiration which our Liberals con-
sidered tantamount to disloyalty—and at
home it connoted approval of a high tariff,
an Australian navy and compulsory military
service. Still, some fresh alias had to be
unearthed when the war came, and just as
Cookism and Deakinism had fused into
Liberalism, so Hughesism and Cookism coal-
esced and became Nationalism. That once
proud name is now irretrievably destroyed
so far as Australia is concerned. It smells
of everything that is most undesirable in our
politics, but chiefly and above all of Tory-
ism at its worst —of local trusts and rich
absentees, of £25,000 “presentations” and
of bought titles. In finding an acceptable
style wherewith to replace it the anti-Labor
coalition in the Federal Parliament will be
faced w’ith a stiff task. The name Im-
perialism was becoming fly-blown before the
war, and since those days—not because
Imperialism is an inherently bad thing, but
because impostors exploited it to bring them-
selves into prominence—it has developed into
a subject for derision. The Democratic
Party might do, but that name has been ren-
dered ludicrous in N. S. Wales owing to its
adoption by the State R.C. Party of one
member. The Australian Party remains.
That should be good enough for any set of
politicians, though in submitting it The
Bulletin has a dreary suspicion that it is
destined to follow the other corpses in due
course. It is one of the most impressive
facts in favor of Labor that, as a party, it
has so far not been obliged to change its
name. " --
“Two Guineas a Minute.”
The Myerson libel suit, which was ad-
journed by Campbell, J, before the holidays,
looks like establishing a N. S. Wales record
for costliness —at any rate in nisi prius. So
far, one witness, the plaintiff, has been parti-
ally dealt with, and the case has cost £4OOO,
or about £2 2s. a minute. This remarkable
instance of thoroughness, or whatever it may
be called —often to be noted where, as the
barristers have it, ‘‘the money is good”-
was a matter chiefly of interminable objec-
tions, point-takings and wranglings on the
part of counsel. Over and over again the
Judge protested that “the time of the Court
was being wasted,” but beyond evoking sharp
protests from the barristers, his complaints
were of little or no avail. One side has
announced that it may call 20 or 30 wit-
nesses; and there is scant probability that
the opposition will allow itself to be out-
distanced as regards zeal in this respect. The
Judge did no more than his duty iu speaking
out as he did; and it is to be regretted that
more members of the N. S. Wales Bench —
the weakest in some respects that the State
has ever known —do not show’ equal courage
in similar circumstances. It is the Judge’s
business to safeguard the rights of a num-
ber of sections. In the first place, there is
the juror class. The “time of the Court”
is every juror’s time —hours aud days and
weeks during which his business may be
going to ruin. It is the general public’s
time—the time of every taxpayer who helps
to pay the salary of the Court officials, from
the dignitary on the bench downwards. And
it is the time of the thousands of litigants
who are continually having justice denied
them over unconscionable periods, for the
reason referred to by Mr. Justice Campbell
*—because in certain eases “the time of the
Court is wasted.” There is another asoect
of the scandal —and of late years the thing
has developed into a very definite scandal —
and that is the damage it is doing to the good
repute of our legal system. With monoto-
nous regularity the public sees suits in which
the issues are of elemental simplicity dragged
out to inordinate length, for no other reason
on earth, apparently, than that those con-
cerned, or some of them, are able to find
the substantial sums required daily by the
barristers before they will go into court. The
public may be an ass, collectively, but it
is not quite such an unmitigated specimen
of the breed as to be blind to the fact that
whereas, in Brown v. Brown (Smith co-
re.) finality is usually reached in an hour or
so (Brown being an artisan on the basic
wage), in Smith v. Smith (Brown co-re.)
the contest is liable to last three weeks and
run into £lO,OOO or more —because Smith is
reputed to be worth £lOO,OOO. The Judge
who protested in the Myerson case voiced
the sentiments of thousands who have served
on juries; of other thousands who have liti-
gated and had cause to rue it; and of those
who would litigate were it not for the dread
of being financially victimised. But it
would seem as though the Judge can do no
more than protest. If this is so, the Bar
Council might take a hand in the matter.
And, if the Bar Council is as impotent to
vindicate the honor of the barristers as the
Council of the B.M.A. declared itself the
other day to be in respect of the doctors, and
as the Council of the Law Institute has given
recent signs of being as regards the solicitors,
then Parliament might consider the question.
It is clearly the urgent concern of somebody
in authority.
The Case of Labor.
Two days after the recent political disturb-
ance, j. M. Bower, presiuenc of the in. S.
Wales A.L.P., bngniened tue monotony of
waiting for the returns to roll in ny an-
nouncing that Ins crowd had “an excellent
chance of being returned with a majority
over all other parties.” He was connaent,
it seems, of 41 seats. Three days later, in
a circular issued over the names of Charl-
ton, jDuoley and Caiuhner, it was an-
nounced that “the response has not been
satisfactory”; that “the conditions which
the leadership of a discredited Prime Min-
ister gave us in the appeal to the country”
were eminently "favorahie," but that “j_.aiD.or
failed-to take advantage” of them. Which
is the sober truth, power referred exult-
ingly to “the solid swing-over in N. S.
V\ales.” The swing-over has been such
that Power's party will own 13 of the
28 N. 8. Wales seats in the House of
Heps., whereas three years ago it owned
14 out of 27. All told, it has 29 seats in the
Chamber where Ministries are made and un-
made—only two more than in 1919; only
seven more than in 1917, when things were at
their worst. It has been out of office for six
years, and, at the same rate of progress,
will remain out for another nine. Except in
Westralia, it has recovered much of its old
ground in the cities, but has conspicuously
failed to do so in the provinces. Ter it used
to be predominantly a country party. Of
the 26 Labor llepresentatives elected in
1906 17 came from provincial constituencies
and only nine from the capitals. To the 29
returned on Dec. 16 the country contributed
13 and the capitals 16, Sydney and Mel-
bourne being responsible for as many as all
the rest of Australia. And at least eight
of the 13 successful country Labontes,
emerged from the struggle with decidedly
unsafe majorities. As time goes on and the
Cockles strengthen their organisation, which
is still very imperfect, the A.L.P. will find
it increasingly difficult to hold Hume, Wer-
-riwa, Gwydir, Wannon, Ballarat, Capricor-
- nia, Grey, Angas and Kalgoorlie; arid to re-
gain Calare, Macquarie, Biverina, Indi, Cor-
angamite, Maranoa, Herbert and Wide Bay.
That is, unless the lost 'faith of the small
agriculturists, dairy-farmers, graziers, plant-
ers and fruitgrowers who used to vote Labor
can be regained, and that will never happen
until the party is reformed root and branch.
The silly imported objective will have to be
dropped, for one thing, as well as the shady
Tammanyisin assailed by Charlton, Dooley
and Gardiner. A halt will have to be called
to the craze for Government ownership, the
multiplication of public servants and the
Government stroke; and it will need to be
frankly recognised that honest finance and
scientific taxation are just as necessary to
Labor as to other sections of the community.
At present the Australian who doesn’t hap-
pen to be a unionist or a civil servant can’t
vote for a Labor Ministry without feeling
that he has let himself in for lavish public
borrowing, gorgeous adventures iu the Gov-
ernment-enterprise line, contracts which sug-
gest lunacy or worse, reckless appointments
of and bribes to public servants, savage addi-
tions to his taxation and a dizzy increase in
the cost of railways, silos and irrigation
works owing to the slowing-down system.
As long as this feeling exists Labor will re-
main in the wilderness, as did the U.S. Demo-
crats after the Civil War. In the post-war
history of these two parties, each supreme
before the call to arms, there are striking
points of resemblance.
Fuller Finance.
Though the Fuller Government professes
to be N. S. Wales’s financial cleaner-up, its
loan estimates were a very shady lot. They
included £20,000 for improvements to the
Observatory Hill resumed area, which, hav-
ing been resumed 23 years ago, might be
expected to be hoeing its owu little
row by now. Then there were loans
for the State Stores Supply, the State
Clothing Factory, ditto Drug Depot,
ditto State Colliery, settlement of returned
soldiers on the land (£250,000 more goes into
that sink), wire-netting, etc., presumably for
returned soldiers on the land (£200,000) and
loans to soldiers already on the land; also
loans for punts, ferries, new dredging’plant
(old loan plant presumably worn out), court-
houses, tourist resorts, State metal quarries
sawmills and buildings to provide gratis
education (£500,000 of high-interest-bearing
money for gratis education) ; loans to provide
work for returned soldiers and sailors, also
to repair main roads (£lOO,OOO for soleing
and heeling worn-out roads), three more
loans (one of £456,000) to settle these billions
of returned soldiers on the land; some loan
money to settle Broken Hill miners on the
land, where they should prosper exceedingly,
being fresh from the verdant hills and vales
of the Barrier; and, among other things, a
little loan to finance a veterinary station for
permanent and reproductive sick horses.
Amid all this grand and petty larceny, also
rot, ruin and throwing of bad money after
worse, the big vote for the Sydney city rail-
way looks almost honest, as Cornstalk loan
honesty goes, of course, till one ponders
this remark, on page 9 of the last annual
report of the Railway Commissioners re the
loathsome gash that has been hacked across
Hyde Park on the way to a new station near
the top of King-street:—
The opening of this station will not, however,
afford any appreciable relief to the congested state
of the city traffic, which is daily becoming more
acute. The only solution of this serious traffic
problem is the extension of the four tracks from the
vicinity of Campbell and Goulburn streets right
through to the Town Hall and Wynyard-square
stations, and the early construction of the Eastern
Suburbs electric tracks from Park-street eastward
to Bondi Junction.
If the opening of the beautiful new station
won’t relieve the congested state of the city,
how much sense or advantage is there in
opening the expensive new station? It.almost
suggests that a good part of the work is on the
wrong side of George-street, that much of the
gash is, therefore, waste gash, and that
the business is some kind of political job or
blunder, like the absurd Central terminus
or dead end. When it was mooted many
engineers said that Sydney didn’t want a
dead. end or cul-de-sac, but a line right
through the city, with a big station about
Wynyard-square and a bridge over the har-
bor. Then the engine of an incoming train
wouldn’t be boxed idly in a hole till it was
time for another engine to drag the train out
again, and a main-line suburban train might
be one from Homebush or Parramatta to
Hornsby, doing its shunting business in the
country, far from the madding crowd. But
wiseacres like O’Stjllivan insisted that the
Central contraption would supply all needs
for half-a-century, anyhow.
Condoning Anarchy.
“But for the Fascist movement Italy to-day would
be a hotbed of Bolshevism. The movement first de-
finitely manifested itself shortly after the Armistice
in 1918. The failure of the Italian Socialists to
repudiate the spreading poison of Bolshevism
is assigned as the real reason of its origin.
The controlling force behind this great and unique
movement is Benito Mussolini. Less than two years
ago he was unknown to the world; now, before
he is 40, he is leader and dictator of the most
powerful party in Italy, wielding the unanswerable
weapon of a trained and disciplined army of men.”
— Sydney Telegraph.
If these approving remarks had appeared in
an anarchist paper they would have .been
in place, for such sheets desire bloodshed,
and usually .disregard! the lessons of hisfcpry.
But what are papers like the Telegraph
doing in such a galley? The Fascism of
Italy is essentially the same as the Ku Klux
Ivlanism of the U.S. ; both represent the
substitution of “direct action” for the rule
of law. Their leaders claim to commit mur-
der and outrage and destroy property on
high ethical grounds; but so did the French
and,, a century later, the Russian revolu-
tionaries, and so, apparently, do De Valera
and his republican followers in Ireland to-
day. An end can be found to. justify any
means provided the criminal has sufficient
effrontery. Fascism is not “unique”: it
lias , existed in every age, and so far as the
country to which we owe our laws; and
liberties is concerned it was grappled with
at a very early stage. Up to the present
the Fascists claim to have cudgelled several
hundred of their fellow-citizens to death as
Socialists, while .thousands, more have .been
assaulted in various ways on charges of
drunkenness or loose conduct. Naturally,
many innocent citizens have suffered. To
quote the London Evening Standard
(3/11/122) ■ •
In their progress, the "Fascists have gathered: under
their banners a riffraff. element, who, under the
cloak of their comrades’ patriotic spirit, found
opportunity to avenge private wrongs, further private
feuds, and indulge in a campaign of murder for
murder’s sake.
The Ku Klux Ivlan started about, half-a-
century ago with a hi’falutiu programme
very similar to that of the Fascists, but de-
veloped before long into one of the most
dangerous criminal organisations in the
U.S., and at the present time, with count-
less burnings, hangings and floggings to its
credit, it is engaging the anxious attention
of the Federal authorities —necessarily so,
since in many of the States- the Klans-
men have usurped the functions of govern-
ment as completely as the Fascists have
managed to do in Italy. The English have
always been strong on the point that the
deadliest menace to their liberties is the
adventurer who, however specious liis pro-
fessions of patriotism and highmindedness,
attempts to set up a penal system of his
own; and this is why England has had
fewer bloody revolutions and has achieved a
greater measure of liberty than any country.
The sensible principle is that any man
may advocate reform, but he who sets out
to enforce it by violence must be punished.
Chief Justice Foster put it as concisely
as any of his successors two and a half
centuries ago in his charge to the jury in
Rex v. Tonge and others :—
It is clear that they all agreed to subvert the
Government.... The prisoners are in themselves
inconsiderable; they are only the outboughs; but
it such fellows are not met withal, they are the
fittest instruments to set up a Jack Straw and a
hat Tyler; therefore, you must lop them off or thev
will encourage others.
1 ascism and Ivlanism have contrived to
make anarchy look something like order in
Italy and the . Southern States of America,
but it is only in such places, where the poor
are hopelessly dispirited, that the middle
classes could hope to bring off a bluff of the
sort. In this country, for example, where
the day-laborer has as lively an appreciation
of his rights as any millionaire, and
as keen a disposition to fight for
them, the encouragement of a moral
campaign, enforced by cudgels and castor-oil.
could only lead to civil war, in the course of
which at least as many contusions would be
endured and as much oil swallowed by one
section as. by the other.. There is only one
rational line for law-abiding newspapers to
take towards such - movements as Fascism
in a community like ours, and that is the
intolerant one which has characterised the
English . bench for centuries past.
At Sassafras.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Hughes is considering the situation at Sassa-
fras.”
"The tumult and the. shouting dies” ;
The screaming cross-heads fade and flee;
The ■ post-election victory lies
Are bellowed less determinedly ,
By either side, as people see
That neither crowd advantage has;
And Hughes, K.C., P.C., M.F.,
Is thinking hard at Sassafras.
Does he, in that Arcadian bourne,
Assail with axe and saw the wood
Like to the other Bill, at Doom?
Or does he prostrate lie, and brood
In "dreams whereon no hopes intrude,
And brand electors in the mass
With lurid epithets and rude
From calm, sequestered-Sassafras ?
Does Boynton’s fate with poignant pain
His bosom wring? Is he distressed
That Earle is numbered with the slain,
And Rodgers and Lamond and Best
Have lobbed (politically) west?
Now Massy Greene the coup de grace
Has copped, is Massy’s chief possessed
With black despair at Sassafras?
Teeth does he impotently gnash,
And fingers clench in futile rage,
Reflecting that lie’s done his dash
And must resign to Watt or Page
The limelit centre of the stage
Where ’twas his wont to strut and gas?
Do bitter thoughts like these engage •
The squire-cMW-sage of Sassafras?
I see a broken man who goes
At Sassafras from brae to bank
And curses acidly the foes
Wljo wait to rob him of his rank.
“From here,” he cries, “in pomp and swank
I lorded all the land. Alas!
That I should have to walk the plank
Aud take the knock at Sassafras!”

Christinas Charity and Unemployment.
Padre James Green comes back-
It is an unusual experience for me to find myself
in agreement with “Sky Pilot” (B. 21/12/ 22) on
the above question. No doubt the churches and mis-
sions in the congested areas of Sydney weaken their
moral authority by indiscriminate charity dispensed
at Christmas-time. This refers specially to so-
called “missions,” which are regarded by the non-
working poor as milch-cows to be drawn upon on
all holidays, times of strike and epidemics. I know
that ordinarily the city churches and missions, inves-
tigate many cases, but at special seasons, such as
Christmas, they advertise for gifts and subscriptions,
receive them on a large scale and distribute
them carelessly. It is bad for the rich of Suburbia
to drug themselves into complacency by gifts when
they should take part personally in social work, and
at least inform themselves of the methods pursued
by their almoners. The only Christian charity
which is valuable is that kindly ministry of gocd
cheer bestowed without blare of trumpets on those
well known to the charity workers all the year
round. There are struggling widows with young
families, in some cases orphaned families, sticking
together to keep the home up. There are worthy
old-age or invalid pensioners and cases of special
misfortune. But in most cases Christmas cheer must
be offered as a neighborly privilege and not as
alms-giving.
“Sky Pilot” speaks of unemployment. Probably
he knows, as other social workers do, that
at Christmas much of the unemployment is volun-
tary. Many unskilled laborers trek back to
Sydney for Christmas. They simply abandon their
work on one excuse or another, or no excuse, and
join the Christmas crowds in the capital. What
they lack in personal resources they make up by
tapping the stream of indiscriminate charity. Then,
as a last resource, there is always the Government
to browbeat. This year the usual deputation gath-
ered up Archbishop Kelly, Dean Talbot and Dr.
Arthur on the way to the Premier’s office to assist
in convicting the Government of its sins. “Better
50 years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay,” and
better a month or two of unproductive Government
relief works than six months’ steady job in produc-
tive labor out of Sydney. Another cause of Christ-
mas unemployment is that employers, particularly
employers of unskilled labor, arrange to end their
jobs before Christmas, and will not take anything
else on until well into the New Year. They cannot
rely on the labor. It is a thoroughly accepted fact
chat many strikes are tacitly organised just before
Christmas. The sailor and stoker want to spent
the festive season ashore, and the miner needs the
time to spend a bit of his money, and if there is a
little strike pay to go round so much the better 1
“Sky Pilot” traces this unemployment to our land
laws. He need not go into such difficult economic
regions to find the cause. If he is a pukka social
worker among the masses, he must know that the
prime cause of unemployment is the Labor party’s
insane opposition to apprenticeship. We are be-
coming a nation of helots, because, in the name of
Labor, our boys are denied the right to learn trades.
A society made up too much of unskilled labor
always lives on the thin shell of a volcanic crater,
and revolution is always possible. “Sky Pilot’s”
experience must be like that of every ether social
worker, viz., that mechanics seldom beg. In many
years’ experience I could count upon one hand the
number of carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers, plast-
erers, painters, etc., who have appealed fo<- help, and
probably investigation would have shown that these
were not really artisans! There is something
ennobling and making for sturdy independence in
craftsmanship. These facts should be known, and
The Bulletin might investigate and advertise them.
I challenge the authorities to collect the statistics of
the prisons, reformatories and Government institu-
tions to see if my contention is not correct, that
It is unskilled labor which provides our criminals
and our mendicants. It is increasingly difficult to
get boys taught any form of craftsmanship, and
our artisan class is recruited from the immigrants,
whilst our native-born are relegated to dead-end
callings or passed into the great army of the un-
skilled. Even the' Anzac bursaries are handed over
to the Education Department to get examination
results! How many soldiers’ sons have been taught
trades? On the other hand, there is something un-
manning in casual and unskilled labor. It either
breeds the servile, cringing spirit which is not
ashamed to beg, or a dangerous revolutionary temper
which regards what it vaguely calls “the capitalist
class” as something to be exploited or assaulted.
No doubt unskilled labor always votes Labor, and
prefers the most extreme form of it; and undoubtedly
the shadow of coming events seems to forecast a gen-
eral return of Labor to power in a year or two.
When that times comes Labor’s own Nemesis will
be full-grown and menacing, and probably demand-
ing more than Australia can economically yield.
After that the deluge!
The Horrors of S.P.
One F. A. W. Gisborne, writing in the
Quarterly Review, revealed some truths
about that vast, neglected Federal property
which no politician cares about, because it
has no votes to give away:—
Chinese experts have pronounced the valley of the
Adelaide equal in natural richness to the famous
rice-lands of Hainan. The plains adjacent to the
Victoria, the Daly and the Margaret rivers are
equally fertile. Sugar, cotton, rubber, rice, indigo,
coffee and many varieties of fibre plants—sisal hemp
in particular—have been experimentally grown there
and elsewhere with the most encouraging results.
Further inland and eastwards, the rich black soil of
the Barklv tablelands, some 20,000,000 acres in
jxtent, is believed by some authorities to be adapted
for wheat growing. A similar tract °n the
Victoria, nearly twice as extensive and equally
fertile, may yet rival the famous black lands of
Russia or the Canadian prairies as a source ot food
supplies In such streams as the \ lctoria, the
lsalv, the Roper, the Adelaide and the McArthur
the Northern Territory possesses the finest natural
waterways on the Australian continent, with the
possible exceptions of the hitzroy and the Murray.
Sydney Telegraph quoted some of Gibson’s
eulogium with approval, adding on its own
account: —•
There are drawbacks, of course —areas of barren-
ness and infertility and strange stock diseases —but,
admitting all this, mighty empires have been built
upon natural wealth many times less impressive than
that of the Northern Territory, whose problems have
stricken the rest of Australia with some strange
paralysis.
The fact is, a prime cause of the N.T.'s
strange paralysis (hereinafter called S.P.
for short) was the A.W.U. They made
the meat business impossible by demands
which ran as high as 565. per day for youths.
When a vessel was expected the meeting
suggested a gathering of cannibals shouting
“Meat!” when the new missionary hove in
sight. Its object was to decide whether it
would be possible to extract £lO or
only £5 for a night’s work, and to
ascertain just how slow the go-slow
could be made without standing still or going
backwards. On one occasion the pace
threatened to delay a 10-days’ job over 35
days, but a compromise was arrived at. The
work was done in 10 days, and 35 days were
paid for. When the loading of the little Gov-
ernment steamer with stores tor the forlorn
settlers at Booroloola cost more than the
value of the stores a sort of amusing climax
was reached. S.P. set in at Darwin —the
Bolshevik stronghold. Industries closed
wholesale. Population fled to places which

by the capitalistic Commonwealth. Even the
plunderers mostly left for places where the
bones of the carcase of prosperity weren’t
picked so bare, though they promised to come
back should capitalism furnish a new carcase.
The people who remain are mostly discolored
folk, officials of the B’ederal Circumlocution
Office, and paupers on Government rations.
Salaries and rations come from the other
States. Practically nothing is doing at Dar-
win, according to the Administrator, except
on the wharves, and snipping is only a
quarter of what it was seven or eight years
ago. Savings-bank deposits have dropped
65 per cent. It reads like the familiar
description of an outlying Turkish or
Egyptian city—say Khartoum, as described
in an old “Dictionary of Dates.” “Its pros-
perity was destroyed by the rapacity of its
governors: population now only about
15,000.” If there existed a railway from
Adelaide, which is a sane sort of place,
whereby police, workmen (to alleviate the
chronic hold-up), special magistrates (if
wanted) and ordinary folk who haven’t gone
off their heads could reach Darwin in three
or four days and Alice Springs in half the
time, the Territory would be as normal a
spot as Parramatta or Bathurst, and S.P.
would be unknown. But politicians
held up this work, for which S. Aus-
tralia has paid, and to which the Com-
monwealth’s honor is pledged, hrst because-
they held the development of Federal
property to be waste of money, and later
because there were more votes to be bought
by diverting the line through the western
deserts of N. 8. Wales and Queensland, and
joining it up with Brisbane. The saving in
riot and waste by the building of the straight
line would have nearly paid for the line
already. The Northern Territory, away
from haunted and bedevilled Darwin, isn’t
doing so badly. Alice Springs, a place with
the climate of Paradise most of the year, had
231 white inhabitants on census day. There
might be a worse record for Australia’s most
central township, which is about 400 miles
from railhead one way, about 600 miles
another way, and anything from 500 to
1000 in two more ways. There were 180 white
folk at Brock’s Creek; 106 at Katherine
River; 354 at Pine Creek; and modest
records were put up by Anthony’s Lagoon,
Daly River, Newcastle Waters, etc. Most
of the Territory names along the survey of
the South-to-North railway suggest water,
for it is not country like that on. the Federal
desert line to Perth, where there is_not one
permanent trickle of fresh fluid in 1051 miles.
If a 4ft. line were built steadily from
the south that would be the end of S.P.
But if it were built from the north with
Territory labor the work would get S.P.
itself.
From Victoria: —
In the course of a recent address in Melbourne,
Dr. Mannix said that in his experience when "God
Save Ireland” was played the audience usually stood,
but when an Australian national song was played
no one thought of rising, and he went on to urge
his listeners to always put Australia first, not only in
a sentimental but in a practical way. Whenever
available, people should use all kinds of Australian
goods from a reaping-machine to a powder-puff in
a lady’s bag. And so on. In this speech there was
not a word of criticism levelled at the Empire or
at the British Government. It looks like the begin-
ning of the new regime, more especially as the rest of
our erstwhile militant exiles have been similarly
pacific of late. The Irish overseas consider that their
country has at last had a fair deal from the
immemorial oppressor—that is to say, about 99 per
cent, of them do —and they appear to be becoming
“Empire men” a good deal more quickly tfian the
Boer extremists did 20 years ago. It seems almost
too good to be true, but if it is so, and the fester-
ing old Irish sore is really on the mend, it should
be about the best thing that has happened to
this country since Fritz cracked.
In the United States, where the Ku Klux
Klan rages exceedingly down South, and the
investigation into the coal-mining massacres
in the North is blocked by sheer terrorism,
and where there were 40 murders on Christ-
mas Bay, and eight deaths from wood alco-
hol in New York City alone, the Senate has
been giving serious consideration to an ethi-
cal problem. Its attitude is that nothing
would be gained by joining the Allies in a
conference upon world affairs unless the said
Allies abandon the “spirit” (not wood spirit)
“of hate.” The difficulty of arriving at a
common understanding on this point is that
Harding’s country owes the Hun a vast debt
of gratitude, and countries like France, Bel-
gium and Serb.a don’t. Germany was instru-
mental in making Uncle Sam the world’s
greatest shipowner, the possessor of almost
all the world’s gold, the man with a mort-
gage on the globe, a very fair imitation of the
lord of the seas, and a sort of all-pervading
arbiter of destiny. About 53,000 lives was
the price, but that handful of men could be
easily spared, especially as they were almost
bound to die of wood-alcohol in any case.
When President Wilson was in Europe with
his Fourteen Points, he considered the deso-
lation of Belgium, and said, in a high Chris-
tian attitude, that he forgave the enemy
even that. But his country hasn’t forgiven
the ruined Allies any of their debts.
“Hawk”: The suggestion of “H.H.” (B.
21/12/’22) that the late elections prove the
necessity for compulsory voting with the
right of a negative vote deserves to be
promptly and ruthlessly clubbed. We are
supposed to have a representative Govern-
ment —not an ideal one —-and I should like
to know in what way our new 7 array of
soap-box phonographs is, with its known
qualities, unrepresentative. This idea of
making others do things because you think
it would be good for them was the most
objectionable feature of the Hughes regime.
The Hun is the standing example of benevo-
lent despotism and the attempt by autho-
rity to suppress personal initiative for the
collective good, and his directors were just
as patriotic and efficient as we could
hope to have. To take only one example,
the proposed negative compulsory vote
would be most exasperating to bush-dwell-
ers. Who is going to ride or foot it 10
or 20 miles to say they don’t care a con-
tinental for either or any of the candidates?
From the bush point of view, we are already
too much governed and overburdened with
officials to enforce existing laws; and every
fresh law, however beneficent in intention,
adds its quota to this army of non-producers.
The obvious cause of the late attenuated
vote was the unregretted absence of the
Irish question, the Home Rule and Rome
Rule slogans. Many of my neighbors had
no use for a vote if it was not to boost
Dr. Mannix or get him deported. And it
is this crowd, w T ho can only see Orange or
Green, that it is proposed, aided by an extra
army of police and officials, to drive to the
voting booth!
“Red Hussar” : One frequently hears from
self-righteous people who assert that a con-
siderable percentage of unemployed returned
soldiers are unemployable, and that such
moral lepers deserve no sympathy or even
mercy. It raises the question: Why
should not a man whose moral character has
been damaged be as sympathetically treated
as one who has been injured in his body?
Many soldiers on enlistment were mere boys.
They were frequently the most idealistic and
unselfishly patriotic of all the troops. They
went and did their bit; but their plastic
characters set in an environment of car-
nage, of “scrounging” and of immorality.
Surely the boy whose character was maimed
in the slums of Cairo deserves some con-
sideration ; all the sympathy needn’t be re-
served for him who was maimed or gassed or
shell-shocked in the field. I could tell of high-
spirited lads—perhaps without a grain of
vice in them —who fell foul of the Military
Police (admittedly the dregs of the AJ.F.)
and ended up with three months in Wands-
worth. Was their offence really much worse
than that of the man who contracted enteric
by drinking at a forbidden well? I realise
'that it would be difficult to prove that moral
deficiencies are directly traceable to war con-
ditions. Still, an examination of war records
would show the authorities the names, of
men, now unemployed, who at some time
were front-line soldiers. In such cases sub-
sequent crimes should not be held too heavily
against them. If a man was a waster to
start with, it was only the rarest combina-
tion of circumstances that landed him in
the front line.
•
When Bendigo left off gold-mining for the
Christmas holidays it looked back and said
it had had a good year, as years go. The
yield was only 540 z. less than the year before,
and the calls only exceeded the dividends by
£5360. The bowelless capitalist collected
£31,500, and paid away £36,860. for the
pleasure of doing it, but then he made a
trifle here and there by selling bad scrip to
other heartless capitalists, and he might have
done worse on the racecourse. In 1921 divi-
dends were only £15,750, but then calls were
so much less that the loss was a mere £1573.
A strenuous effort to galvanise the field into
new life had the usual luck of galvanising
the expenditure more than the income. The
gold-mining habit is hard to get rid of, but
a person who liked big habits would hardly
think the Bendigo gamble worth while.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The A.W.U. tried to brighten up the
Newcastle steelworkers at the sad year-end
by pointing- out how its vigorous interfer-
ence had got a judgment from the Indus-
trial Full Court which added £84,000 a
year to their wages. To which a voice from
Newcastle replied that the award gained by
the A.W.U.’s dashed interference had closed
the industry, and no one was getting any-
thing. If the Steel Industry Union, run by
men who knew things, was still on its
own there might lie hope, but the
A.W.U. knows little or nothing about steel.
This is natural, since the A.W.U.’s aider-
men, Lord Mayors and members of Parlia-
ment are mostly glorified ex-shearers who
have sat in city offices for so many years
that they have even forgotten what they
ever knew about their own side of industry.
Asked by a Nationalist what he thought
Hughes should do, Aliek Peacock quoted pre-
cedents, in which lie himself was concerned.
Said Peacock : “I got out in ’l7 when the
electors of Vic. gave a hint —-not quite so
broad as Billy has got-—that they didn’t
want me, and Bent made way for Murray in
’OP. Thomas waited till the non-Laborites
had chosen Murray as leader of the united
party. I just threw up the sponge and
pointed to Bowser. Party leaders are like
ladies’ hats: they got unfashionable if they
stay too long on top.”
Benin’s warning to his Australian visi-
tors,. Garden and Earsman, not to go Bol-
sheviking so wildly in this country, might
have been more vigorous if they hadn’t been
in a position to reply that the last two
Labor Conferences had adopted his original
programme in its entirety. The Dictator
was rather in the position of Satan reprov-
ing sin; but why should he not ? Who
should know more about sin than Satan?
Two varieties of trouble were struck last
week by Dooley, the N. S. Wales Labor
leader. In one instance he set his hand to
a circular (Charlton and Gardiner are the
other signatories) which pointedly suggests
that the “movement” is suffering from rotten
selection ballots, too much A.W.U.. and lack
of “moral force” ; also, that the A.L.P.
executive is running it into the ground. In
the other case it transpired that when he
was Acting-Premier a cement co. was pre-
sented with a long-distance contract for
supplies at £5 Bs. a ton, with the result that
the Government is losing about £2 18s. on
every ton that comes to hand. It is rec-
koned that the total loss will be in the
neighborhood of half-a-million. The A.W.U.
executive has ordered Dooley to give an
account of himself, but not regarding the
cement contract. No one is ever carpeted at
Macdonell House for chucking away the
people’s money.
Perth (W.A.) is ruminating on the coinci-
dence that its M.L.A, (elected in 1921) and
its new M.H.R. answer to the name of Mann.
Both call themselves Nationalists, and used
to be Government servants. In that capacity
they were associated in the trml and con-
viction of Martha Rendall, the last lady
hanged in \\ .A.—the M.L.A. as the detective
who worked up the case; the M.H.R. as the
analyst who found traces of poison in the
remains. That was 16 years ago; and in a
sense the interesting pair have been associ-
ated again in the trial and conviction of
“Nationalism.” The jury brought in a ver-
dict of “guilty,” and Earle Page will pull
the rope.
The Iliginbotham tradition is becoming
stronger instead of weaker in Vic. Attorney-
General Robinson advised Governor Strad-
brolce that he could assent to the bill for
payment of members of the Uppah Chambah,
and need not send it to Buckingham Palace
for the monniker of George V. His Ex. signed
accordingly. But it is rather melancholy to
think of light from the lamp of Higmbotnam
being turned on for the benefit of the House
of Landlords.
Almost the only good news that Queens-
land has sent out for seven years is to the
effect that 160,000 acres will be under cotton
IN THE DISCARD.
CARDINAL WOLSEY HUGHES: “Ah, if I had only served my country as I have served
god, I would not now in my old age he getting the push.”
this year, and the crop will probably be worth
a million, or £lO per acre. The cotton
country of Australia has a far more reliable
rainfall than the wheat country, and cotton
is a valuable crop. Egypt lives on it to a
considerable extent, and Egypt is a curious
land. It measures 350,000 square miles, but
only the Delta and the irrigable Nile strip
count, and in plenty of places a man can
walk across the strip in 10 minutes on a hot
day. The 12,023 square miles which form
the real Egypt (less than half the area of
Tasmania) supported 12f million people,
according to the 1917 census, or 1061 closer
settlers to the square mile, and from it, in
1920, there , was exported £77,000,000 worth
of cotton. Morbid Tories always say, with
a sniff, that cotton-growing is purely a
colored-man’s job, because, like maize,
bananas,' potatoes, oranges, tobacco and. pos-
sibly, wheat, cotton came originally from a
colored-man’s land. But such persons are
at a discount now.
"Organiser”: Of all the Ministers whose
political carcases repose on their shields
Hughes misses Massy Greene most. Greene,
incomparably the ablest all-rounder in the
Government, was versed in all the details
of every department. He could be relied
upon to put up a plausible case on any
question that might arise in Parliament,
from the cream bonus to the theory and
operation of exchange rates. And he might
have saved his seat if Ryrie hadn’t gone to
Grafton and enthusiastically denounced the
cow-cocky, who abounds in the Richmond
electorate, a piece of folly that cost Greene
stacks of votes. Seeing that Ryrie has a
soft seat down by Manly, and that he is
about as much use in a Ministry as Hughes
would be in a bayonet charge, why doesn’t
he pull out, instead of Marr or Bowden or
Cameron, in favor of the serviceable Greene?
The position in Commonwealth polices:
Cunningham’s return for Gwydir (N.S.W.) —he
beat Wilkins, the one-legged Digger, by 37 votes,
thanks to Nationalist second preferences—leaves
Labor the most numerous group in the House of
Reps., with 29 members. The Nationalists have
27, the Country party 14, the Liberals (excluding
Foster) 4 ; ai d the other is an Independent. The
first of the N.S.W. Senate seats was won by the
Laborite Allan McDougall, which means, at least,
that Josiah Thomas will join the dismal list of
defeated Hugheseliers. There is a story that Hughes
will resign conditionally upon his nominating Bruce
as his successor. Considering that nearly half his
Ministers have gone, that his personal followers
were almost wiped out, and that he owes his seat
to the charity or gullibility of the Liberal-Nation-
alists —what is more, his majority in North Sydney
was less than half of that recorded for the non-
Labor Senate candidates—he should not be allowed
to impose conditions. If he won’t go out grace-
fully, he will have to be heaved out. The threat
of another election is grotesque folly. What is
wanted is a working arrangement among the three
non-Labor groups, under a leader congenial to all—
it may be Watt, Pratten, Bruce or Earle Page—
such as Westralia has had for the last six years.
“Binks”: Camberwell, Canterbury and
Haw-hawthorn (Vie.) are intensely grieved
at the rejection of Bobby Best. The flar-
ing circulars of the Protestant Fed. and the
repeated allegation that Latham, though a
minister’s son, was a member of the Ration-
alist Association, were supposed to have made
Ivooyong safe for Best, but, by one of life’s
little ironies, the issue was decided by Jean
Daley, of whose second preferences 4769 out
of 5341 went to Latham and gave him a
victory by 329. Gullett, the best of the
Henty five, failed to shake the self-satisfied
Francis, but here the cross-voting, which was
so capricious as to suggest strong sectarian
and personal prejudices, was too much for
the earnest journalist. Melbourne Herald,
deeply interested in the foregoing elections,
inasmuch as Gullett is on the staff, and
Best is partner of the paper’s busy chair-
man, Theodore Fink, could safely weep for
Gullett’s defeat for sound Liberal reasons,
but could only regret Best’s departure on
purely personal grounds. Considerately
enough, the sheet catalogued the virtues of
both in columns of grovel, though its anti-
Nationalist cartoons left no doubt as to
which candidate it would have preferred had
its private feelings been left out.
Circumstances alter cases so much that,
after the alterations are completed, its best
friend wouldn’t recognise the blessed old cast 1
if he met it in the street. France badly
wanted the Rhine-Moselle border, for, with
that strong line of defence instead of a
silly furrow on a plain, it reckoned it could
dispense with a quarter-million soldiers. It
was refused because such an arrangement
would put sundry Germans under French
rule unless they emigrated. The sacred
principle of nationalism was at stake.
Britain badly wanted Mesopotamia, quite a
big place and almost wholly peopled by
Mohammedans, where there is that precious
substance, oil, to make the Empire more
independent of the U.S. trust. So Meso-
potamia was made a new State, only Britain
runs the whole show, and when the Turk
asked that he might have the odd-corner city
of Mosul returned, he was greeted with a
bellow of derision. The arrangement is
doubtless good for Mesopotamia, just as the
Rhine border would have been good for
France, and just as independence might be
good for Ireland if the people didn’t burn
down Dublin more than once a week, and it
suits Britain down to the ground. But it
gives a sort of jolt to the sacred principle
aforementioned.
“Gallery”: Hughes gave three subdued
cheers at the news of Fowler’s defeat in
Perth. Fowler has never loved Hughes, and
his contempt for the little man’s muddling
was expressed in a scarifying booklet, and in
fearless opinions delivered in the House. 1
remember him one night attacking the Pri-
minister from the second Ministerial bench in
a speech that remains unique for its blistering
invective. Hughes was -absent—-though ‘his
presence would have made no difference—-but
most of his colleagues were there, sitting in
a cowering silence without thought of re-
prisals. No one ventured an interjection.
Everybody was amazed at Fowler’s skill in
the choice of words. The dour Scotsman
was unbendably honest, and worked indefati-
gably for bis constituents. He deserved a
kinder fate.
N.S.W. Attorney-General Bavin spent part
of the season of goodwill and over-eating in
an effort to adjust matters at the Newcastle
steel works. However, the position is hardly
of the adjustable sort. The loss of four
hours per week, added to the struggle to pay
war wages out of peace prices, turned a
scanty profit into a loss that was not scanty,
and work stopped. The Industrial Court
offered the co. a reduction of wages barely
sufficient to keep its hair above water, pro-
ved the amount saved was regarded as a
liability to be paid later on. In other words,
it said: “Would you like to resume work
after Christmas with a big liability every
week for your sole reward?” And‘but for
the fact that there is such a thing as con-
tempt of court the co. would probably have
replied : “Would you like to resume work after
Christmas with a flogging in lieu of salary?”
Some idea of the dimensions of the Red
Hague in Australia may be gathered from
the fact that 466 cases of venereal disease
were notified in Victoria alone during Novem-
ber, 19.*,2. In N.S.W. the Holman Govern-
ment fell into line with other civilised States
by making syphilis a notifiable complaint, but
was afraid to make the Act operative. Then
the Storey Ministry gained office, and
Gregory McGirr, the Labor landlord who
owns half Parkes, became Minister of Health
and abolished notification altogether. In
none of the States is the policv being en-
forced seriously, and the amount of concealed
v .D. that must be floating round would cer-
tainly make the Seven Plagues of Egypt look-
cheap if there was only some way of tabling
the lot for comparison.
A NEW PRAYER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dean Talbot (N.S.W.) suggests that the revised
edition of the Church of England prayer-book should
include a prayer for use at election time, to stir
the people to a sense of their responsibility.
O Lord, Who lett’st no sparrow fall
Before its time, as well we wist,
Nor Labor man nor Liberal,
Nor even wobbling Nationalist,
Give heed while our petition rolls
Throneward for various worthy souls
In deadly peril at the polls.
There’s Jones. If reaping' wheat and oats
His cocky friends should so obsess
That they; neglect to cast their votes
He’ll lose the number of his mess.
Let one day’s work be left undone,
Or how can Bullockville be won
For this Agrarian champion?
Brown’s safe to get the men’s support
At pure merino Devils dyke,
But rumor hints he’s not the sort
That more exacting women like.
He Scorns his social p’s and q's
And holds unduly tolerant views
About philandering and booze.
Lord, make then on election day
To faults like these a trifle blind,
Or else the sitting members may
As like as not be found behind.
Put pharisaie feeling down
Or in this highly proper town
’Twill go exceeding hard with Brown.
Though Smith has scored the Labor nom.
He’s too advanced for some, ’tis said,
While insufficiently a bomb
To satisfy the ultra-red—
Here’s of our orison the pith:
Let Labor ranks close up forthwith,
Or trouble may encompass Smith.
Lord of the ballot-box and booth,
Of Lib. and Lab. and National,
Who mak’st the going rough or smooth
And eke the goer stand or fall,
Now let the suffrage-scorning herd
From out its lethargy be stirred,
Or men like these may get the bird.

In 1914 43.8 p.c. of the gross profit from
brewings, etc., wont into the appropriation
account; last year 27. J p.c. The recent
expansion of gross profits has not been due
wholly to additional brewings at the Kent
brewery. Less than two years ago Tooths
bought out Castlemaine and Wood Bros., of
Newcastle, which in its last year made
£176,214 gross and £30,000 net. This deal
gave the co. a firm footing in the big coal-
mining and industrial centre, but, owing to
the depression there since the steel-works
and other industries shut down or curtailed
production, this field has not given the trade
which could have been expected. However,
the year’s profits improved sufficiently to give
the ordinaries 1.0 p.c., and also pay 10 p.c.
on prefs. ... .
This increased div. for the prefs. created
a rumpus at the anuual meeting which was
entirely out of order. Ordinaries in 1 dlo
received these prefs. as bonus shares. A
special resolution provided for preferential
security and a cumulative div. of 6 p.c.
p.a., but —
whenever, in the opinion of the directors, the
profits of the co. in respect of any year shall be
more than sufficient to pay the fixed pref. div. and
also a div. of 10 p.c. on the ordinary shares. ■ the
directors mav increase the div. on the preference
and/or ordinary shares to such a rate as they may
determine.
The'pref. div. rate is, therefore, wholly a
matter for the directors, and they are uot
obliged to pay more than 6 p.e., even it hand-
some profits are made. The introductory
table shows how erratic the pref. div. rate
lias been; consequently, the usual features
of a pref. issue are absent: the actual value
of the scrip for seller or buyer cannot be
satisfactorily assessed, and the holder can-
not anticipate his income. Actually these
shares are preferential to the extent of o
n.c. and deferred for some points more under
certain conditions, and then entirely at the
discretion of directors. This, capital is un-
satisfactory both from the point of view oi
the company and of investors, and some re-
adjustment is advisable. The best course
would probably be to give pref. holders the
option of converting their scrip into straight-
out ordinaries or of accepting prefs. with a
fixed cumulative 8 p.c.
The pi’ospects of Tooth and Co. are prob-
ably brighter now than they have been at any
time since the war began. Last sTear5 Tear ? sood
profits were made in spite of depression m
numerous industries, and that performance
wives promise of even better returns when
conditions became normal, _ notwithstanding
that another of the periodic raids on beer
was made lately—this time by the State Gov-
ernment. Heavier licensing fees are to be
paid after June 30 next, but they are on a more
equitable basis in so far as the tax in futuie
is to be on the volume of trade. One absurd
anomaly, however, is that high-class clubs,
which do not distribute a penny of their
profits, are taxed on the same basis as the
poorest-class pub whose earnings are often
squandered on the pony-courses. Latest
brewerv profits have probably been assisted
by the lower costs of raw materials, and,
possibly, to a slight extent, by wage reduc-
tions. At September 30 Tooth’s showed
£955,676 in cash, deposits, War Loan, stocks
and book debts. Liabilities totalled £297,411,
so there was a liquid surplus of £608,2(>i.
To represent the £1,589,382 balance of capi-
tal not represented by liquid assets there
were breweries, plant and machinery, and
hotel and other properties with a book value
of £1,973,245. What portion of these fixed
assets is utilised wholly in brewing is not
ascertainable, but should N. S. Wales decide
to go dry—there seems no likelihood of that,
in the immediate future, at least —a con-
siderable amount would be found in proper-
ties, etc., which have a value independent of
the beer which flows through them. In
recent years, while substantial allowances
have probably been made for depreciation
and contingencies, the values of some of the
co.’s assets, particularly properties, have
no doubt appreciated considerably.

In Victoria, as in Queensland, employers are
obliged to take out a policy to protect their
employees, and both States established a Gov-
ernment office to handle the business. The
Queensland Labor Government gave its office
a complete monopoly of workmen’s compensa-
tion insurance, but in Vic. Private Enter-
prise was allowed to share the policies.
Though in both instances the State offices
were established primarily to handle the
business at as near cost-price as sound under-
writing will permit, Southern employers
have been content to allow P.E. to take
the bulk of their insurances. For its eighth
year, ended June 30 last, the Vic. State Acci-
dent Office’s total income was £43,901; the
Queensland Workmen’s Compensation depart-
ment collected £330,000-odd in its sixth year.
But the expansion of business has been
greater than the figures of the introductory
table indicate : in the early years of policy-
writing Commissioner Wm. Holmes reduced
rates on several occasions, and Private Enter-
prise followed suit. Though he cannot show
large figures, the Commissioner claims that
the State office has been the “means of em-
ployers obtaining special benefits, whether
they insured in the Department or other
offices.” The last premium revision was in
1918, when the Commissioner decided that
rates had been reduced to bedrock for pur-
poses of sound underwriting. Nevertheless,
two years later the Commissioner distributed
£lO,OBO in bonuses, equal to 11.4 p.c. on the
previous three years’ premiums. After mak-
ing liberal provision for unexpired risks and
unadjusted claims, and placing £3500 more
to credit of general reserves, for the past
year £4045 was voted into a bonus reserve,
which now amounts to £6746. If all goes
well there will probably be another rebate
to policy-holders at the close of the current
year.
The underwriting experience for the past
six years has been as follows: —-
Net Premiums. Claims. Expenses.
1917 .. £26,249 £13,976 £5417
1918 .. 27,426 14,251 5247
1919 . . 28,650 17,567 5030
1920 .. 32,473 21,411 5364
1921 . . 39,363 ' 26,864 6584
1922 . . 42,475 26,765 7014
A feature of last year’s operations was the
smaller loss rate. Previously it had been
steadily becoming heavier, owing partly to
premium reductions. Claims and provisions
for ascertained losses took 63 p.c. of pre-
mium income last year, compared with 1918,
52 p.c.; 1919, 61 p.c.; 1920, 66 p.c.; 1921,
68 p.c. In four years the expense rate has
been reduced from 19 p.c. to 16.5 p.c. The
business is, therefore, handled cheaply, and
the low costs explain how the Commissioner
can find surpluses for bonuses. Including the
bonus reserve, at June 30 the office had
funds totalling £57,859, which exceeded the
losses of the past two years, and which, as
the Commissioner states, “should preclude
any possibility of the office at any time be-
coming a charge on the consolidated
revenue.” Instead, it appears to make cheap
money available for the Treasury, and the
Commissioner is evidently at n disadvantage
so far as his investments are concerned. At
the balance £33,098 was lying at the Treas-
ury, and the £31,202 of general and bonus
reserves were also invested there. Interest
earnings for the year represented only 2. <
p.c. on average funds.

At the 1921 balance £15,000 was provided
“to cover the fall in stock values” ; but the
slump was so severe that that appropria-
tion proved inadequate to give any profit
from the past year’s trading. Sales were
slow, so the Joe Gardiner management de-
cided to “vitalise business by keener prices.”
Though no profit margin was possible under
these conditions, turnover was increased —
sales for the last three months of the finan-
cial year were double those for the same
period of the previous year—and stocks were
restored to a healthy state. This co. regu-
larly calls in an outside expert to overhaul
its stocks, and on this occasion Jos. Vickery
states that, at the balancing date,
all lines inspected had been, practically without
exception, bought at very low figures and were
exceptional values I was practically unable to
discover any old high-price goods.
The co. appears to have overcome the
troubles resulting from the phenomenal de-
cline of values which followed upon
the war and the unprecedented demand for
leather during that unsettled period. But
when it was trading on a rising market Joe
Gardiner’s did not make profits larger than
in pre-war days, though it earned hand-
some divs. Between 1914-20 only £16,000
was added to visible reserves, and as the
losses for the past two years amounted to
£22,426, and £19,887 of reserves were capi-
talised in 1917, the P. and L. account at
the latest balance was on the wrong side of
the books to the extent of £10,472. Adding
the intangible goodwill item (£6777) gives
the £17,249 deficit shown in the introduc-
tory table—that “deficit” being the portion
of the £BO,OOO of paid capital which has no
tangible asset to represent it.
Though lower values have been ruling,
stocks at July 31 stood at £102,417 com-
pared with £74,427 12 months before, and
liabilities, apart from mortgages, at £70,781
were £36,284 larger. Mortgages amounted
to £12,708. Other assets were: freeholds
and leaseholds and equipment, £30,325;
cash, book debts, etc., £14,786. Since the
balance some entries have altered consider-
ably : the co. has purchased the freehold
of its headquarters. The directors evidently
found a bargain: they announce that for
half the property they have refused an offer
of more than was paid for the whole of it.

The Kauri Timber directors are to be com-
mended for the way in which they detail
the affairs of the eo. for shareholders each
year. Practically all other timber cos. issue
accounts in as abbreviated a form as the law
will allow, and in some instances Profit and
Loss accounts are dispensed with altogether.
The Kauri people not only show where trad-
ing and milling profits go; they also give
assets in detail, show depreciation allow-
ances for each group, explain the movements
in a half-dozen reserves and generally pre-
sent the accounts in a manner which enables
the shareholders to develop an intelligent
interest in the business. The profits shown
by the introductory table are not the net
earnings. For purposes of comparison they
include depreciation allowances, etc., which
are shown in the written-off column. The
co. had an exceptional harvest in 1921 —
for the 12 months following upon the recon-
struction the management was completing
contracts undertaken at high prices during
the war period. During the early portion of
the year ended August 31 last trade was
slack, but as the year progressed there was a
recovery, particularly in Melbourne and
Auckland house-building. The directors’ re-
port claims a net profit of £60,612, or only
the odd hundreds in excess of the amount re-
quired for 8 p.c. divs. But that was after
spending £16,652 on the maintenance of
mills and plant, writing £14,860 off the book
value of properties, plant, etc., and laying
aside £30,147 for taxation.
As a result of the return of portion of
capital two years ago and the writing up of
assets and subsequent bonus issue, the 8 p.c.
div. is giving old shareholders a good return.
But prior to the reconstruction there had
not been much in the enterprise for share-
holders. Between 1890-99 no divs. at all
were paid, and 7s. per share had been struck
off. On this written-down capital divs.
gradually recovered until 8 p.c. was paid in
1908, and that was the approximate average
until the reconstruction. But, meanwhile,
the management was building up the co.’s
strength, and assets had also been steadily
appreciating in value despite the continu-
ous millings. Paid capital is now £750,000.
The reserves of £216,650 shown by the in-
troductory table are made up in this way:
contingency reserve, which was the surplus
ascertained in the reconstruction, £156,929 ;
div. equalisation fund, £20,000; fire and
marine insurance reserves, £25,372; log re-
serve, £621; P. and L. balance, £13,728. In
addition there was £11,084 in a contingency
fund. A large portion of the specific re-
serves can, no doubt, be regarded as genuine
accumulated profit. The book value of free-
hold and leasehold properties, including
timber thereon, was £289,055 at August 31;
plant, machinery and vessels, after deprecia-
tion on a liberal scale had been allowed,
stood at £162.605. Stocks and stores were
valued at £412.997; book debts amounted to
£116,718: £88,951 had been invested in War
Loans, debentures, mortgages, etc.; there
was £5121 of cash on hand: and shares in
other cos. were valued at £93,166. Stocks
were unusually large at the balance, and
consequently liabilities were bigger: £90,11 <
was owing to sundry creditors, there was a
bank overdraft totalling £46,231, and £12,180
had been raised by loans at call. _ These
figures have altered considerably since the
balance: three months later sales of timber
had enabled the management to extinguish
the bank overdraft.

Howard Smith’s are the managing agents
of this Western N. S. Wales colliery, but
evidently even that influence could not over-
come the trading difficulties of the past 12
months. The Invincible accounts disclose
a profit which to a penny coincides with
the amount taken by divs. totalling 51 p.c.
The accounts are not informative: no Profit
and Loss account is published, and no ink-
ling given of depreciation allowances. An-
other view of the year’s performances is
given by these comparisons:—
1916. 1920. 1921. 1922.
Liquid assets .. £10,410 £45,860 £59.605 £46,418
Liabilities .. 3,588 6,989 12,266 2,901
Surplus .. £6,822 £38,871 £47,339 £43,517
After payment of the final div. for 1921
there was a surplus of liquid assets over lia-
bilities of £36,939; by September 30 last
that surplus had, including the interim div.,
been increased to £46,637. So the improve-
ment for the 12 months was £9698 after
plant, etc., had been maintained in good
order. The net profit for the period would
be that £9698 less whatever was a fair pro-
vision for depreciation of plant, etc., and
for the amortisation of colliery property.
Besides the £11,299 of reserves shown in
the table there is £13.160 in an accident, in-
surance reserve, but the extent of the risks
the co. is carrying is not ascertainable. The
Invincible co. began in 1906, but it was not
true to its title. The concern was recon-
structed in 1913, and Howard Smith’s be-
came interested. In nine years divs. have
totalled 52-J p.c., and though there has been
nothing fat in that return, meanwhile the
co.’s position has been much improved.
After pavment of the latest final div. almost
£41,000 of the £104,000 paid capital was
represented by the surplus of liquid assets
over liabilities.

of this timber underground there to-day. For
strength combined with lightness and easy
handling, Oregon would be hard to beat for
general mining purposes. During the war,
Oregon soared in price, and for a time became
almost unprocurable. This set the Barrier
cos. looking for something to replace it, and
Tasmanian stringybark and Westralian karri
came in for attention. The nearest forests
of importance were those in the Adelaide
hills, and the South Co. bought cutting rights
over large tracts anywhere close to the rail-
way. The Zinc Corporation went further
south and purchased timber country at
Myponga, and the Junction North erected
saws at Second Valley, not very far away.
The Zinc. Corp. has set a good example by
doing a lot of reafforestation, and has same
nice blocks of Pinus insignis and other trees
planted. The North has stringybark country
in Tasmania. But the price of Oregon is once
more less than that of Australian timber, and
the ’Murltan stuff is taking the lead again.
After all, our own hardwoods are too good to
bury underground.

Mt. Morgan accounts are now presented
only once each year, but chairman J. M.
Niall has issued an interim report for the
six months to the end of November. The
statement bears out anticipations that under
existing working conditions and with metals
at present prices the big; mine cannot make a
do of things even witli the subsidy the Theo-
dore Government thrust on it so that wages
could be maintained at a higher level than
the industry warranted. During the first three
months of the period operations were handi-
capped by an inadequate labor team. Alto-
gether 102,209 tons ore were concentrated,
and the smelters put through 74,121 tons
material for 30084 tons copper and 32,3460 z.
gold. After debiting the proportion of over-
head charges, including depreciation, and
taking unsold products at latest market
value, operations are claimed to have re-
sulted in a loss exceeding £25,000. Since
the basis of the present working conditions
was decided upon almost two years ago the
market value of blister has slumped £29
and the gold-premium has almost dis-
appeared. The outlook is not at all bright.
Though the co. hopes to make economies
which will reduce the working loss, the State
cannot indefinitely continue its subsidies,
neither can the co. be expected to continue
ta depreciate the value of its mining pro-
perty by digging out large quantities of
metal which cost more than their market
value.

The outback finds made by the Westralian
State Prospecting Party have been acquired
by a syndicate of 1200 £lO shares, of which
200 contributing have been sold to the public
and the balance are paid-ups taken by the
prospectors and their friends. Later on, it
is proposed to try and, form a larger co.
The finds are in a waterless belt of sand
and spinifex beyond Laverton and on the
fringe of country which, in the past, has
been notorious for failures.

John Warrick, of the Gt. Boulder (W.A.),
who has been oversighting Mutooroo affairs
since its second advent at Hampton Plains,
has now taken an option for the co. over
72 acres close to the 37-mile peg on the
East-West railway. Warrick, who is a
veteran at the game, says this show has
the best indications over a length of 300 ft.
he has seen for the last 30 years, except at
the Bullfinch. Quartz is “kindly and favor-
able,” and 21 samples over the 300 ft. aver-
aged 35dwt.

Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) reserves were esti-
mated two years ago at. 340,000 tons of a
recoverable value of 265. per ton. Then
a fire burnt the mill and the mine was shut
down. During the previous year 135,230
tons of 265. 4d. ore were treated at a loss
of £17,096, but £77,353 received on account
of gold premium converted the loss into a
profit of £60,257. At the last annual meet-
ing chairman Doolette said that the arbitra-
tion award further increased costs to 325.
lOd. per ton, which rendered the average
grade of the ore in the mine worthless. So
if Doolette is right the co. will have to treat
richer ore, and so work the mine above its
capacity in order to carry on at a profit.
The ore in sight, if it could be treated at a
profit, is equivalent to five years’ supply for
the 25-head mill which it is proposed to
install..
Nevertheless, Gwalia looks better on paper
than the market valuation suggests. At the
date of the last balance-sheet (Dec. 31,
1921) the co.’s principal assets, apart from
mine and plant were: Investments (includ-
ing £37.650 of War Loans), £116,038; Trea-
sury bills (since matured), £19,773; cash,
£46,500; stores, £28,000. On that date the
co. owed about £45.000. During 1922. in-
cluding premium, gold to the value of about
£65,000 was won from accumulated slimes,
and that should have been more than suffi-
cient to cover all mine expenditure. The
25-head battery ordered in November is ex-
pected to be running in April, and if the
Board decides to treat the best of the reserves
and wait until costs come down before spend-
ing any money on development some divs.

A co. with a nominal capital of £62,500,
but with comparatively little cash, has
acquired the old Buldania leases, near Norse-
man (W.A.). Years ago scarcity of
water, hard country and poor extractions
forced the previous owners to give up, and
the new co. will be lucky if it can overcome
these difficulties.
Associated Northern (W.A.) has re-
opened its Ora Banda show. Years ago,
when values were better and the co. could
pick and choose ore for the mill, some profits
were made, but with a falling grade and
high costs prospects appear very different
now.

Victoria’s gold return for 1922 was
95,1230 z. The general decline is best illus-
trated in the statement that Bendigo, on
the lowest mark in its history, produced
more than half of the State yield. The de-
partmental report states that in several of
the old fields “prospects are encouraging.
At Maldon, Daylesford and Wood’s Point
good yields are being obtained from mines
where operations had ceased, or nearly so.
Fresh discoveries in the Wood’s Point dis-
trict prove that it has undoubted resources,
but it is handicapped by the high cost of
materials in isolated parts.” The four dis-
tricts named are likely to make a better
showing tins year, but there can be no hope
of a revival of the golden glories of the past.
Bendigo got much closer to making its
gold industry pay during 1922 than
for many years. Divs. totalled £31,5:00,
against calls of £36,860. After all, it is
a bapren record, for only one mine—New
Red, White and Blue—distributed profits.
Dyason’s overloaded Bend go Amalgamated
won 20,1610 z. from 59,023 j ops, but failed
to give a profit. Since. 1006 the field has
been drifting badly, both in the value of
gold and divs. paid.: Tn that year divs.
amounted to £246,251 and calls to £221,262.
Next year divs. dropped to £122,017, but
calls moved to £298,799, Shareholders in
1908 contributed only £135,922. although
divs. were larger at £126.268. The last big
year of call-paying was 1912, when £154,482
was put up against divs, of £123,515, and
although results were well in favor of inves-
tors in 1913-14-15 to the tune of about
£120,000, still the cash flowing into the
mines continued to dwindle. Records since
1915 have been as follows:
Dividends. Calls. Profit.
1916.. £13,275 £46,419
1917.. 6,4,51: , 66,780
1918.. -4. :: 81,606
1919.. 1,822 63,258
1920.. 45,026 29,091 £15,935
1921.. 15,750 17,803
1922.. 31,500 36,860
The big merger for the greater part of the
time mopped up the profits from Carlisle,
Unity and Constellation to keep the pick
going elsewhere in the fruitless search for
a winner. The average grade of the field
is not bad: nearly lOdwt. for 108,484 tons
treated. Standing out is the New . Red,
White and Blue with an average of 14|dwt.
* * * *
New Blue (Bendigo) records for the year
were: Tons crushed, 24,951; yield, 18,4530 z.;
average, 14dwt. 19gr. per ton; dividends,
14s. per share (total £31,500). In 1921
divs. amounted to 7s. per share, so that out
of the formation now being worked the co.
has paid 21s. per share, or £47,250 in less
than 18 months. In addition, heavy expen-
diture has been incurred in development and
exploratory work. New Blue starts 1923
with £2OOO to credit; the mine is reported
to be looking well at all points ; and it is
confidently predicted that this year’s results
will show an improvement on those of last
year. Lansell’s North Blue has squared up
to the south boundary on lOdwt. spurs in
a big formation, which, it is expected, will
continue in the New Blue ground for from
200 ft. to 300 ft., making a material addition
to the latter’s reserves. The record of the
Lansell mine for the year was 25530 z. from
5600 tons.
On the Bendigo call list last year were : Ulster
£5550, South Blue £5524, Lansell’s Needle
£5250, Central Blue £3200, A 1 £2616, South
Moon £2400, Deborah £2lOO. These costly
prospecting undertakings are maintained
almost solely on local knowledge and con-
fidence ; all, with one exception, have been
large producers, and it will be a strange
perversity of fortune if some of them do
not : come again. Numerous resurrections
which have recently been made will make
this year’s call-list a formidable one.

“Bendigonian”: The importance of the
spur systems at Bendigo is well illustrated
by the facts relating to the Carlisle mine.
In the past decade more than 80,000 oz. of
gold have been won from this mine from a
system of spurs at a depth of about 1269 ft.,
and worked for more than 1000 ft. in length.
The profits from them exceeded £BO.OOO. In
places the spurs have been worked for a
width of more than 100 ft., and the most pro-
ductive zone is encompassed in a height of
about 50ft. The spurs pitch south, and
they occur successively one above the other,
of varying thickness, the best values gener-
ally showing in the small veins. The gold
is of a coarse nature, and specimens contain-
ing up to 15oz. gold have been got. The co.
has thousands of feet north and south to
prospect on the continuations of these runs
of spurs. The South Moon and New Moon
mines, which have paid over £BOO,OOO in
divs., got their best results from spurry
formations, and to-day the excellent returns
from the New Blue are almost solely won
from th : s source. An interesting technical
description of their occurrences is given by
Dr. Stillwell in his “Factors Influencing
Bold Deposition in the Bendigo Goldfield,”
issued in 1918 by the Bureau of Science and
Industry.
* * * *
A co. is being formed to operate on the
quartz reefs at Allendale, Smeaton (Vic.),
which were exposed at the shallow levels on
the western boundary of the town in the
period when the alluvial mines were very
prosperous. In the reef drives of the famous
Berry mines large quartz formations were
intersected ;' they, -were all gold-bearing, but
none .was payable. It was the same at the
Australasian lend, at Creswick ; some of the
reefs at the head of the lead have been
worked, but without any marked success.
Under the . Midas lead there were massive
lode formations, some of which were fairly
good in patches, but batteries were non-pay-
ing appliances. Further north, at Clunes,
in the early times several mines were worked
extensively, both in alluvial and quartz.
There the localisation of rich alluvial in
conjunction with the reef was very pro-
nounced ; on northern and southern exten-
sions the lodes became unpayable, and so
d d the alluvial diminish in value. At Caris-
brook (Chalk’s) and Maryborough (Duke),
quartz reefs were plentiful. but none show-
ing gold in sufficient quantity to indicate it
as the feeder of the very rich alluvial de-
posits. Ballarat proper is a consp cuous
example of the combined localisation of rich-
ness—-the rich alluvial and quartz mines
were all within the same comparatively cir-
cumscribed areas. Reasoning for analogy,
it would seem as though the golden lcde-
feeders have not been located on the other
fields. Searching for them under hundreds
of feet of basalt covering flowing rivers is
out of the question. Bendigo presents a
geological enigma in respect of its alluvial
deposits. The famous White Hills represent
an ancient #ii ; fev-bed, which.;;is much higher
and is quite unrelated to the shallow alluvial
gullies. Whence this old river started and
whither it vanished are beyond conjecture.

Now that the Queensland Government
has allowed Private Enterprise to partici-
pate in the search for oil in the Roma dis-
trict, the details of the agreement made
with the licensees of the Orallo area are of
interest. The six licensees who are trans-
ferring their interests to the Lander Oil
Corp. were each permitted to take up 2000-
acre blocks for five years, during which
period they have the right to take up,
under the 1915 Petroleum Act, six leases
which will aggregate not more than 1000
acres. Duncan Milsom, as authorised agent
and representative of each of the licensees,
is directed to erect boring plant and, within
the first two years of the license, spend
“such sums up to £50,000 as shall be neces-
sary to produce petroleum or prove that the
area is barren.” Crown royalty is provided
for at the rate of 121 p.c. of the gross
value of production. The agreement also
provides that, though the licensees have the
right to form a co. to operate the areas,
no prospectus shall be issued or sale of
shares advertised until the first bore has
been completed, boring to commence within
nine months from the date of the agreement
(October 12).

When Mines Minister Jones was up Chil-
lagoe way last month he told the locals
that he proposed to send a geological and
prospecting party to look over the far-north
country, between Chillagoe and Palmer
fields. The idea is to open up another gold-
field or two, and the party is apparently
to be built somewhat on the lines of the
Westralian Government parties. Probably
the job will be taken on during the coming-
winter. By that time something definite
ought to be known of the prospects of Mt.
Madden and Mt. Buchanan, recently taken
up by Arthur Clarke’s syndicate. There
has been a vague report that the reefs re-
cently bored on at the Palmer have proved
to continue into the black slates there, but
the information is of little value, as the
field appears to have no resemblance to
Gympie. The Palmer was great in alluvial,
but it has never looked like really good
reefing country.

Blair Athol coalfield (Q.) is still starving
for orders, and for November the trade was
only 6376 tons, of which the B. A. Co.
turned out just about half. The output
previously had been as much as 15,000 tons.
The open-cut is being proceeded with: a
steam excavator is at work, and the
dirt is being carted away. Newcastle,
Ltd., is looking on, but is not fol-
lowing suit so far, although it has a pro*
position equally favorable for open-cutting.
The B.A. should sweep up all the local
orders, as the new system will make a dif-
ference of roughly 7s. per ton in coal-win-
ning. Blair Athol coal seems to be better
liked than Bowen, in the North, but the
latter will get the trade owing to its posi-
tion. With Mt. Morgan being supplied by
its own colliery, the Railway Department
getting the bulk of its supplies from the two
State mines in the Central District, and no
industrial centres near, the outlook seems
blue unless the export trade becomes good.

The Billy Hughes, at Normanby (Q.),
will be crushing this month. There is a
good paddock of ore at the Frederick mine.
At present this show looks a bit disappoint-
ing compared with the prospect of three*
months ago. The ore shoots have proved
patchy. The winze from the 50ft. level is
down a few feet on a nice bit of ore assay-
ing 2oz. and averaging 2ft. wide, but it may
be only a pocket. Much depends on the reef
in the 751‘t. crosscut. Normanby was look-
ing promising a while back; at present the
local feeling is that prospects have flattened
a bit. A lease has been taken over the
ground where Sw«allow reported finding a
7ft. reef lately. If confirmed, it is easily
the biggest yet found in the Normanby field.

The Victory, at Wolfram (N.Q.), is the
first molybdenite show to get going again.
The shaft underlies to a depth of 160 ft.,
and driving on the lode is proceeding there.
The face is rich in wolfram, molybdenite,
mixed with pyrites, and has so far averaged
a foot wide for about ISft. along the level.
Molybdenite is mostly being dug out now,
but it is too early to prophesy whether
operations can continue on 455. per unit.
Wolfram is not of much help, as there is
practically no market for it.

Ronpibon’s Talerm block has not been

Instead, the present Australian co. has

an area of nearly 200 acres, showing good bor-
ing results, adjoining Talerm ground, together
with all water-rights, etc., for the 20,000
shares which the Talerm eo. was holding in
reserve. The directors are at present going
into the question of equipping the property.

“Cartot” on an old-time buccaneer:—
In “Voluntary and Other Forces” (B. 14/12/’22) it
is stated that the famous Captain Kidd, when a retired
mariner of 50, was impressed into the Navy to do
duty against pirates. As a matter of fact, Kidd re-
presented an unsuccessful experiment by the British
Admiralty to deal with piracy by granting to private
ships a kind of lettre de marque, which authorised
them to take pirate vessels, and, in return for their
trouble, keep whatever plunder they found. Under
this system Kidd, who had previously been fighting
the French and Spanish in the West Indies, had
the brig Adventure fitted out for him by Earl Bel-
lamy, the Governor of Massachusetts. He arrived
off the western coast of India in 1696, and put in

the best part of 12 months looking for pirates un-
successfully. Then he happened to run into the
Mocca fleet, a convoy of a dozen enormously wealthy
vessels, and helped himself to some of the wealth;
later, he captured and robbed a merchantman on its
way to England from the East Indies. After that
he returned to America. The Lords of the Ad-
miralty , were rather annoyed by this time at the
failure of their bright idea for putting down piracy,
but Lord Bellamy might have been able to get his
partner out of the mess if the pair hadn’t quar-
relled over the division of the spoil. That settled
Kidd, and the exasperated Governor sent him to
London for trial, with the result that he was hanged
in Execution Dock in 1701.

“Harold Hardupp”: A strike on queer
lines is being run by the “hello” girls, at
Sydney G.P.O. The kick they are register-
ing is against the withdrawal of their retir-
ing bonuses (most retirements are for the
purpose of getting married), recently de-
cided upon by the Department. Now, when
a citizen rings exchange, he is liable to be
asked, “What do you think of the Govern-
ment cutting out our bonus money?” and
though no actual threats are made he
achieves a general impression, as it were,
that sympathetic consideration of the young
ladies’ position is advisable if he hopes to
get attention himself. The Department cares
about nothing but votes—a point which was
well made by “Muggins,” anent the telepho-
nic disabilities suffered by the Ryrie-
worshipping electors of Narrabeen —and the
Exchange girls appear to be working with
that great truth as a basis.
“Morehead,” still in religious vein:—
Sydney does not contain, to my knowledge, any
affiliated branches of the Shakers, Holy Rollers,
Blackvoodooists or Dukhobars, all of which sects
flourish in the U.S. It boasts, however, a plethora
of self-contained religions, and it is to the eternal
shame of the Commonwealth Census authorities
that no official information exists concerning the
number and strength of them. After the minor
Christian religions, such as the Baptists and Salv’*
armyites have been disposed of, the thousand-and-one
freak sects are dumped together, most certainly
to their bitter chagrin, as “Other Religions.”
Of these unclassified faiths the Liberal Catholics,
Unitarians, Theosophists and Christian Scientists,
are the intellectual and financial aristocrats. The
Spiritual movement has been fairly torn asunder
by schism. In any one of half-a-dozen remote
suburbs you may find the Church of Spiritual Philo-
sophy, the New Thought Spiritual Society, the
Progressive Christian Spiritualists, the Spiritual
Unfoldment Society, the Spiritual Scientists, the
Spiritual Church of Our Saviour and the Rational
Spiritualists. Most of those odd faiths are intensely
exclusive, and only condescend to allow outsiders to
join up after a searching investigation into the
would-be neophyte’s bona fides. A few, like the
Christadelphians, United Welsh, Kosmons and
Church of Seers, meet in public halls; others fore-
gather in drawing-rooms or small offices, and approach
their Maker per medium of fluent silver-locked
pastors, cracked harmoniums and mournful hymns.
But these are not nearly so numerous as they once
were. The “pitchers,” jazzing and improved trans-
port facilities as regards surf beaches, are daily
assisting to send Venerable, if frowsy, prophets
insolvent by the simple process of robbing them of
their congregations.

matter. Nelson’s pants and
other knicknacks are rever-

Why not the vessel in which
he so gloriously wore the
pants? Sailors are extraor-
dinarily proud of the old

Admiral Sir Graham Bower
(he married a Mitchell, of

sake of the few shillings in the till. Knatch-
bull ended his career on the scaffold, outside
Darlinghurst gaol. Two orphan children of
the murdered woman were taken to England

work on farm. Man to mend fences, milk 12 cows
and do rouseabout jobs; woman to cook for family
(8) and shearers (14), do odd jobs and help with
sewing. Both to provide part food. No wages.
Apply Mrs. X.
Of course it was a hoax, and equally, of
course, the lady is talking libel. The editor’s
defence is that he printed it “in good faith,”
and if he crashes there will be perturbation
in many a newspaper office. The Bulletin
once published a yarn (“How ‘The Keyhole’
Fell”) describing how a paper was ruined
MR. SMITH'S OPPORTUNITY.
THE GIRT : “We live in a wonderful age.
They say tee'll soon only have to touch
a button and everything will be done
for us.”
IT: “That's all right. But I can't imagine
you touching anything in the shape of
a button. Look at my shirts.”
on precisely similar lines. The editor here
printed, in all good faith, a communication
capable of being read in such a way as to
impute undue frivolity to two blameless resi-
dents of the town. I remember the proprie-
tor of a country rag telling me at the time
that the possibilities opened up by this story
had made his blood run cold.

HAIL!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1923,
What have you in your swag for me?
Fifty-two weeks and a day ....perhaps;
Good Luck’s kisses and Bad Luck’s raps ;
Assorted samples of joy and grief,
(Be the former large and the latter brief!) ;
Ease and drudgery, trouble, pleasure,
Mixed and served in the common measure;
Biljs, that’s certain; bills large and small,
And (I hope) the money to pay them all:
Adventures ? No, I would not deride
Their claim but I’m otherwise occupied,
(And a bit faint-hearted) ; no accident,
Bereavement, fire, or rise in rent;
No hateful crow’s feet and no grey hair,
Kindred spirits my thoughts to share,
No sickness, please, and oh, be free
From malice, slander and treachery,
And leave for me, when your sands are run,
An honest record of work well done.
VICTORIA.

THE LIARS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The needful lie you’ll tell with honesty
And good intent. ’Twill cheer an empty heart.
Assure the dame some comeliness hath she,
Smooth wrinkled brows, rob sorrow of her smart.
The man who lies not has an acrid soul,
His spirit hard is, all his accents hoarse.
No neat untruth for simple ones, no dole
Has he to smooth life’s hard and weary course
Tell never the unnecessary lies.
He from whose lips the lies uncounted fall
Is so observed and measured by the wise,
’Twere better far he told no lies at all.
VICTORIA.

“Wilfrido” on some humors of the hust-
ings :
The recent M.L. elections were not wholly devoid
of diversion. One old sportsman, described as an
eleventh-hour candidate, addressed a large meeting-
on superstition, patriotism, coincidences and the
humor of the Scotch. “His electorate,” he declared,
“had the three fundamentals of greatness—a rail-
way station, a brewery and a gaol.” Nothing, how-
ever-, could induce him to state his policy, and after-
spending considerable time in trying to answer the
question of whether or no the harbour should be
tarred and sanded in order to make the fish cleaner,
he entirely lost control of the meeting with the
result that it lapsed into' irresponsible hilarity. An-
other candidate —a youth, and dowered with all Youth’s
starry-eyed aspirations—supplied those whose suf-
frages he was wooing with three pamphlets; the
first was a copy of his opening speech, the second
his own and sparkling retorts to questions
alleged to have been passed up to- him, and the
third a record of his educational and athletic
achievements, together with a photograph of himself
shaking hands with General Birdwood. The picture
was entitled “The Civilian and the Soldier,” but
despite a reference to his friendship with the “Soul
of Anzae” he lost the seat and Labor won the day.
A third candidate issued a manifesto declaring that
he “possessed 164 qualities of God, on which lie
should be made an M.P.,” and described himself as
“the natural result on both sides, intense holy, pious,
CONVINCING.
“You say your laundry woman reminds you
of a good preacher?"
"Yes. She’s always bringing things home to
me that I never sate before."
honest-to-eore parents, one side full of tremendous
courage and spirit like Boadicea, Joan of Arc and
Black Agnes of Dunbar.” The main plank of his
platform was chivalry, and he contended that “un-
less you place the happiness and welfare of girls
and ladies before your own, you can never attain to
that blessed state of mind that Lincoln, Jesus,
Wallace, Sydney More, and all splendid nature’s
gentlemen, also myself, got into themselves.” Be-
sides singing “The Cow with the Slippery Teat” at
each meeting, he applied himself assiduously to hand-
ling such question’s as, “Should gooseberries he topped
as well as tailed?” and he also challenged Massey
to compete with him in a programme consisting of
running, sword-fighting, body-twisting, singing, bare-
back riding and speechmaking. But the gauntlet
lay where it fell, and the sum-total of the nation’s
appreciation of his gifts, physical, mental and spiri-
tual, was represented by a miserable tally of 29
votes.

“Nimshi”: My entry for the Malaprop
or Verbal Inexactitude Stakes is an old
cobbler. He is a staunch Laborite, and
sometimes alludes in hushed tones to the
doings of the A.L.P “confidence. Of
course he has a down upon Billy Hughes,
and confessed the other day that he couldn t
understand the “fishology” of those who
still followed that discredited leader. Speak-
ing of an individual who had a choice of
two jobs, he said he had the “opposition
of claiming either, and the salaries were
much of a muchness, “but,” he added, with
a wink at me, “there’s the ‘emollients’ to be
considered.” I had to consider some of his
amendments on Webster for several seconds
—to sound them, as it were —before I saw
the light; but when I did I realised what a
most useful lot they were on the suggestively
descriptive side.
From a S.A. lawyer:—
The foolishness of having a certain law of inheri-
tance on one side of a particular line on the map,
and a different law a mile away on the other side of
it, is rammed home by the par. (B. 30/11/ 22)
about a man in Victoria "whose parents had married
after his birth and raised a family, none of whom
can legally claim kinship with their brother.”. S.A.
long ago saw the illogical wickedness of punishing
the child in such cases, and enacted that the marriage,
even though tardy, should count to his credit for all
purposes.

“T. 0.1.”: During the time that Admiral
Hall was on the Australian station the land
about Jervis Bay was being surveyed. Hall
east up at the bay one morning, and, making
himself known to the surveyor, obtained Tull
information about the various sites. Ihe
Lands Department was- his next objective,
and, securing a plan, he pointed out a cer-
tain lot which he desired to take up. Ihe
Lands official was very sorry, but it had
been taken up half-an-hour previously—by
the Honorable William Morris Hughes.
“Spenner” tells of a backblocks Machj.fi-
velii
Two days before tlie elections Reilly rode up to
where I was getting the .binder ready for the har-
vest. “You vote'for Blank'/ don’t'yer, Bill?” .1
admitted it. “Well, I vote for Tank, and, as t\e le
both pretty busy,, how about, pairin’ with met It
will save us wastin’ a day.” I thought it a sound
idea,, and agreed. On December 18 I was down the
creek, looking up some stray poddies, when 1 met
Fred Hunter, and asked him casually if he had found
time to get to the polling-booth. “No, 1 paired with
Reilly.” “You what!” “I paired, with. Reilly.” “But
you couldn’t have,” said T. “I paired with Reilly.”
We. were still arguing when up rode Sam
Bali, and we explained the position to him. When
he declared that he, too, had paired with Reilly, light
began to bi'eak in on us. Eventually it transpiied
that Reilly had paired with each of the seven other
settlers on Pino Creek. We were all prepared to
enter into the humor of the situation until we dis-
covered that after all Reilly had been in, recorded
his vote for Tank and then devoted the rest of the
day to rounding up apathetic Tankites in the vici-
nity. It.was this last straw that led to the light
on the pub verandah, though the nominal genesis
of the fray was the spilling of Reilly’s beer by Bill.

“Yardley”.: What bunkum it is to talk
of the close-fistedness of the Scotchman.
After payment of a ship’s-crew the Scotch-
man is penniless as quickly as the
representative of any other nation.. Ihe
world’s record consumption . of
whisky is scarcely a feat that
would be put up annually by a
mean people. Tourists in an
alien country look for what they
have been told is the character-
istic of the nation, and they find
what they seek. If they looked
for thrift in France they would
find the French peasant more
saving than the Scotchman; if
they looked for wit in. Scotland,
they would find Scottish humor
more amusing than the repartee
of the Irish. If there were
anything .in the qualities tradi-
tionally attributed to different
natious, we should seldom need to ask a
man his nationality.

“Harold Hardupp”Each year, about
Christmastime, the Veterans’ Association
meets to have a dinner at the expense of the
Commonwealth Government, and this year
one of the 130 members who rolled up came
in his Soudan War uniform. Such senti-
mentality is rare amongst warriors of a later
vintage. The uniform of Bill of the A.I.F.
has long ago been transformed into pants for
the use of Bill, junior, while the hat that
gladdened the eyes of the girls in London
is used almost exclusively for shelter whilst
cleaning out the fowl-yard. Yet I know
one A.1.F.-er at least who clings with pride
to his war regalia. In a glass-framed cabinet,
embalmed in mothballs, it decorates a promi-
nent place in the ex-Digger’s home. And,
incidentally, the man who sets such store on
memories of his war-time glory was not a
single day in the line.

A place the Best Australians know: —
Tbe last ragged brown ant had toiled up the
plank with the last basket of coal the last “Gilly,
giljy, gilly” of the last Gyppo humbug had been
said; the last chicken had been thrust back into
the last bosom; the last filthy postcard had been
either purchased or refused; the last miserable don-
key had been thrashed to’ catch the last boat, and
the ship slid out of Port Said into the Canal —out
of a slightly improved Port Said, for an attempt
is being made to grow a few trees in the streets.
There are the same interminable stacks of coal as
ever, the same endless ranks of grimy coal-barges,
the same number of boats that have been started
on primitive stocks and then apparently forgotten.
On the right a little vegetation along the fresh-
water canal and an occasional gleam of the steel
rails over which so many thousands of the best Aus-
tralians have been carried. On the left the awful
desert of dirty sand, which, from first to last, swal-
lowed so many hundreds of them. The Canal Service
dredge is still at its Sisyphean job of keeping the
course open; in its weariness it protests with the
squeals of a million pigs. An oiler passes from
Persia; an Arab dhow; and two ragged urchins of
the desert run past on the sands, abreast, the tow-
horses of a boat which a white-bearded Gvopo,
huddled on the stern, keeps off the bank. The spc.k
of the big steamer bares the filth of the sloping
canal-sides; here and there a silver-fish, caught on
a ledge, is left flapping helplessly.
- Ten, fifteen miles, and then it begins to look as
if we were coming to tlie dumping-ground of all the
cities of the world. For seven miles the litter per-
“FIFTY-FIFTY."
“They tell me, doctor, you are a perfect lady-killer."
“Oh, no-no! I assure, you, my dear madam, I make no dis-
tinction between the sexes,"
sists. Thousands of veils of rusted barbed-wire lid
like huge porcupines in the sand. Thousands of
sheets of rusted iron; some still roofing sheds that
are the last word in dilapidation ; more thrown into
disorderly heaps, Piles of rusted railway-plates.
Fingers of steel feel out into the desert that runs
on and on to infinity; but everywhere the sands are
closing upon them —ruins and wrecks of things
that have passed beyond recognition. On one side
near where the accumulation is thickest is El Kan-
tara, the scene of some of the finest women s in
the war. Opposite is Ferry Post, with the wing of the
bridge that carried the flower of Australia into the
deserts of Arabia and Palestine still standing, and
alongside it the now-decaying pontoon bridge which,
during that great burst of feverish energy, swept
the queer, inadequate ferry out of common use.
Back of it the modest little station which is the
terminus of the railway, with whose shrill whistles
the War God pierced the age-long silences of Mt.
Sinai.
A long,, lank officer of the Salvage Corps runs
down to the bank and waves a greeting and a God-
speed. On the little jetty there is the flutter of
white frocks and child cries come across the water.
As always,' there have been found women to share
the white man’s burden. The big ship surges on.
Another mile and the sand humps have it to them-
selves once more.

P. J. Flannagan, of Adelaide, just back

from named politicians and magistrates over

40 cities. His summary is: '‘Conditions are

“Borom” on Pacific outposts and h.q.
forgetfulness i — l
“Pip’s” story of the
English Tommies who were
cut off during the retreat
from Mens and lived for
months in the Forest of
Mormal, had a counterpart
in' the Pacific. Early in
1.D16 s.o m'e'. -Australians
from the. Rabaul garrison
were sent.to occupy a small
island about a hundred
mile; from Witu, between
Rabaul and Madang. There
were nine of thenv with
it second-lieutenant 7 in
charge, and they had three
or four months’ supplies.
By some oVe'rsighiv-they
were entirely forgotten at
headquarters. When their
provisions ran out they
turned to sago, fish,'-Cocoa-
nuts' and■■'sheli-fish, add it
was not 1 long before- they
were - living the- simple,
primitive life. Their
clothes gave out- after
about' the sixth month,- but
it worried them little.
Then somebody at head-
quaiters remembered their
existence, of- unearthed
some reminder Of it,
and a boat was sent' to
bring them back. They
were all found iii tip-top
health, with their pay
piling up, and one of them
informed me some time
afterwards that he would
not have cared if they, had been left there for eight
years, instead of eight months. .

“Morehead” on a delicate subject:—
As against the fecundity of Prahran (Vic.), as
recently pictured by “Dido,” let me advance that
of Redfern (Sydney). During the Federal election
I did a house-to-house canvass of a considerable por-
tion of that working-class suburb, and the embryo
baby-show I saw was • astonishing. T estimate that
every fourth front-door was opened by ladies’ in
that condition euphemistically called “interesting.”
On one occasion I was despatched for a doctor, aiid
on another I topped off my exposition of how,
when and where my man should be voted for by
administering first-aid to a young mother in the
matter of filling in her maternity-bonus application.
To be called in and asked to admire a recent arrival
was common, and I never forgot to suggest that
the baby be christened Blank —after the candidate
[ was assisting. Blank's campaign committee
heatedly debated, and only rejected by a small
margin, a motion of mine that closed-in motor-cars
should be provided for the convenience and self-
respect of those of voting age who were about to add
to the population. Before I leave the subject:
amateur statisticians contend that the birth-rate is
higher about Christmas. It isn’t. The delusion is
due to the fact that at Christmas time the expectant
wife will usually cast false modesty aside, don a
dust-coat and drift round the shops; whereas, at
other periods of the vear she tends to lurk indoors.

“Thorold” : The British tanks would have
had a far better show (B. 21/12/’22)
if Lloyd George, when Munitions Minister,
had not blown the gaff to the Huns in a
speech of garrulous menaces. When Fritz
had been sitting down and gazing across
No Man’s Land for several months, the
excitable Welshman thought it necessary to
stir up Britain’s spirits by announcing that
10 Midlands factories were busy with a great
secret engine for displacing the squareheads
from their burrows. Naturally, tile Hun
Spy Department’s interests were stimulated
too, and within a few weeks the head Fritzes
knew all about the tanks, and diverted the
activities of their Zepps from London to the
Midlands. The beautiful dancer Matahari
—afterwards shot —was sooled on to the
job of worming out of dopey British base-
camp colonels the exact date when the tanks
were to hop over. She wormed to such pur-
pose that there was enough Boche hardware
ready for the big engines when they did
move to stop an avalanche.
CONTRAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s been a bonser Sunday, I suppose,
In cheerful Sydney, sprawling by the sea,
And tarts an’ blokes, in creamy summer clo’es,
. Are in the shops at Manly, havin’ tea.
The lovers in the breeze at Fairy Bower
Are cuddling closer as the church-bells ring;
The moon ascends her star-bejewelled tower,
And in the cool cathedrals choir-boys sing.
But here—we lie and swelter in the heat,
And curse the insects buzzing round the lamp ;
The flies have blown our only bit of meat,
While gritty dust lies over all the camp.
A drink of muddy water is a boon!
A cow bawls loudly for her weaning calf;
And in a gum-tree, up against tiie moon,
A pair of hook-nosed kookaburras laugh.

“Lexite”: Allan McDougall, again top of
the Senate poll, was sec. of the Sydney Eight
Hours Committee when he got his first
selection as a Labor Senate candidate, and
the members of the Eight Hours Committee
decided that he should have his chance.
They were not entitled to spend money
politically, but they enthusiastically en-
dorsed a recommendation that the Sydney
Eight Hours’ Art Union should extend its
operations in the country, and that
McDougall should act as organiser. So
for months he travelled N.S.W. on a free
railway pass and decent salary, made him-
self known everywhere, and finished by top-
ping the poll. No other Senate candidate
has had a similar opportunity before or
since. But that trip was full of profit to
the Eight Hours concern, and on the purely
business record he put up. McDougall,
originally a boilermaker, would have been
eagerly employed by any firm with goods to
sell.
R. J. Tooker. who died recently, was born
when his father was High Sheriff of
Cork (Ireland). It was then that Sir
Henry Hayes, the builder of Vaucluse
House, Sydney, had sentence of death passed
an him for running away with the daughter
of a wealthy Quaker shipowner. The sen-
tence was afterwards commuted to deporta-
tion for life to Australia, and Tooker had
the reprieve document in his possession.
For some, time Tooker engaged in mule-
breeding on Leura station, the nucleus of
his stock being some well-bred Spanish don-
keys. He was also one of those who pegged
out the Mt. Morgan West,, afterwards
acquired by the present Mt. Morgan Pro-
prietary.
When Alfred Felton, of the Bequest, passed

charity and ha’f
for art. It has

annuities, f 30.000

“Horace Hatless”: After a long and
affable political career in N. S. Wales.,
David Storey lias at last got the titular
honor he expected years ago. David held
Randwick as a sort of pocket borough for
26 years, but took to the council when the
plural electorates came into force. He is
remarkable mainly for his Toryism and his
hat. It used invariably to be a grey bell-
topper, but —after the Prince showed a lead
in soft hats—changed sometimes to a felt.
I remember interviewing him in his office,
and, although in his shirt-sleeves, he still
bad his head covered. It may have been
partly because he was a hat-importer—
but his egg-like baldness probably bad more
to do with it. At the end of an election
Storey was returning thanks when a vo.ee
interjected something that sounded to him
like a complimentary remark. “I did not
catch what that gentleman said.” remarked
David. “Put your hat on; you’re naked!”
roared the irreverent interrupter.
H. H. Champion’s impression:—
Hickson, the Faith Healer, will soon be in our
midst, and it will be interesting to see how Aus-
tralia re-acts to him. It is just five years since
my last meeting with him. Into the London draw-
ing-room of a well-known society woman walks a
rather corpulent, broad-shouldered man, with
that air of well-being and prosperity generally
associated with the successful stockbroker. There
is a large gathering of women, war workers for the
most part, with a sprinkling of titled seekers
after the new sensation. He announces the purpose
of the meeting—Prayer for Peace —very simply and
unostentatiously; ore’s ■ first impression is of an
almost prosaic simplicity. Such an entire lack cf
tub-thumping and oratory is almost chilling. But
gradually as this brown-eyed, ruddy man, standing
so solidly and squarely planted before one, unfolds
his naive conviction of the efficacy of prayer, and
the essential perfection of God’s scheme, the audience
is captured. Imperceptibly we are carried on to an
entire disregard for material things, our neighbor’s
irritating lorgnette drops forgotten into her majestic
lap; the lady with an acute cough either ceases
to cough or we become unconscious of it. 'Smoothly,
with no flights of eloquence, but an uncanny sense
of the fitting climax the speaker leads us to the
repetition, phrase for phrase, of his beautiful prayer
for the removal of the world scourge and the estab-
lishment of peace.
An Australian by birth, this strange man has
accomplished many wonders, and is generally credited
by those who come in contact with him with miracu-
lous healing powers. His own claims are less for-
midable, but he believes in the laying-on of hands
and a simpler and more literal interpretation of
the Scriptures. Strangely enough, his personality
could not be described as magnetic. Above all things
he is a plain man, and lacks even the spasmodic out-
bursts of brilliance attained by the majority of popu-
lar preachers. It is difficult to account for his
sudden and dramatic popularity in South Africa.
He seems hardly the tvpe to appeal tremendously
to a colored congregation. Ho is the fortunate
possessor of that rare attraction, a perfectly modulated
and expertly controlled voice, also a singularly
uninterrupted flow of words, which yet avoids degene-
rating into wordiness. Add to these a gift of vivid
and unusual phrase-making, a lack of platform
mannerisms, and a certain concentrated and undevi-
ating earnestness, and still one fails to account for
his spectacular appearance in Africa.
Mclver and Dicker, who were superseded
in the control of prison affairs in Vic., must
get a grin at times from the misfortunes of
Morrison and Couder. There are just as
many “incidents” as heretofore, and the stoiy
goes that Barclay, governor of Melbourne
Gaol, will be made boss at Pentridge, and
Conder Inspector-General—unless he decides
to try something else. The Penal Depart-
ment is a graveyard which contains the
reputation of many a promising V.ctorian.
Bendigo is going to miss just-dead Walter
Eskdale. He had lived there over 40 years,
had gone through the practical mining mill,
and had long experience as company secre-
tary, promoter and sharebroker. His faith
in the d.strict, his energy and his personal
speculations, kept him in the van as a
resurrecter of old mines. His most conspicu-
ous success of late was in leading a syndi-
cate to take up forfeited shares in the New
Blue—almost the full capital of the co. This
was about two years ago, and that “spec” of
3d. a share followed by some more calls has
led to about £40.000 in dividends. Nearly
all the progressive cos. now at work on the
field owe their existence to Eskdale’s enter-
prise and “bustle.”
Dying in Melb. Hospital recently, John
Candy, 61, a rag- and bottle-gatherer, left
belund him in hard cash £lOOO. which is
lodged in a Collins-street bank. He had lived
miserably at a cheap lodging till he went to
hospital. Hoarding had become his passion,
and lie had lost all joy of life. The intestacy
curator is now looking for a brother or other
near relative to claim the old chap’s roll.
“F.”: “Deafv” Duncombe, lately mur-
dered in Tas.. was a well-plucked one. By
a box on the ears in his childhood he was
deafened for life, and gradually developed
an extraordinary of his own, which
was hard to understand. When he emigrated
to the Speck he took up a selection near
Swansea that even the rabbits wouldn’t look
at —a few acres, with the best:crop of stones
for miles around. He picked up the gibbers,
walled in his property with them, and while
clearing the around was caught bv a falling
tree and held helpless for the best part of
two days before he was discovered. A
wooden leg was added to his possessions, and
for years he worked as gardener to a local
resident. At night he would write in a
voluminous diary, or sing the songs of his
childhood, the latter a most striking per-
formance, which led strangers to believe he
was in terrible agony. Every week-end he
went off to his selection laden with cuttings
and seedl'ngs, and gradually he turned his
stony desert into a passable orchard, to
wtroh he later retired. And it was in this
hardly-won paradise that his ne’er-do-well
neighbor shot him as he sat at his lonely tea.
Harold Clapp, Vic.’s railway boss, has a
brother Tim, whom bis contemporaries at
Melb. Grammar 20 years ago will remem-
ber as a lanky youth with flaxen hair, promi-
nent blue eyes, and a smile wide enough to
eat water-melons with. Tim wasn’t a sen-
sational student, but a latent business ability
developed in him, and when he came back to
Melbourne from America a few years ago,
as the representative of an electrical co.
that was doing a bit in abolishing steam
trains for the suburbs, .he was seriously
considered for the biggest chair in the Rail-
way Dept. He has now apparently lost
interest in the electric spark, for he is listed
as one of the bosses of the Vacuum Oil Co.
in Melbourne.
“Dido” : George Dancey, who died in St.
Kilda the other day, had suffered - for years
from excessive blood pressure, and the finish
came with the breaking of a vein upon the
brain. He fell down just after completing a
decoration on which he had been engaged for
a few days, and died within an hour or so.
Dancey was a wonderful draughtsman and
a most scholarly artist. He was a mural
decorator with 15 years’ training behind him
when he arrived in Australia, a victim to
supposed pulmonary trouble, and he took to
cartooning for Melbourne Punch for the
cash which it represented. By sheer deter-
mination he became an effective journalist.
Given a congenial subject he turned out a
striking cartoon on classical lines. Leaving
Punch, lie devoted himself to mural decora-
tion, and many churches throughout Victoria
contain specimens of bis fine draughtsman-
ship and brilliant designing.
“Artbenpce”: Thomas Hardy is of the
same family as Nelson’s famous captain. He
once showed me a picture of his relative, and
''claimed kin” (to
use a Toss phrase)
with pride. The
likeness is not
striking, but in
both faces the
cheek-bones are
very high. “A
family character-
istic,” the author
noted. “All the
Hardys have the
same face!”
Thomas has given
a fine picture of
Nelson’s captain
in “The Trumpet
Major,” a book
which seems to
catch all the
romance of the
old Navy, all the
cha r m of “old,
unhappy, far-off-
tilings.” It is one
of the few books
of Hardy’s which
is not a bitter
tragedy; but even
here there is a
gently pathetic
ending.
A. S. RODGERS,
one of the fallen
Hughcsian
Ministers.
“The Deacon”: Gone on the Big Trip,
Archdeacon Philip Cassidy, of Newtown
(N.S.W.), who, in 72 years, had never left
his native State. He was the only clerical
link (there are one or two laymen left) with
the ill-fated Benedictine experiment at Lynd-
burst. Before it fizzled out Cassidy was
ordained deacon by Archbish. Polding and
priest by Vaughan, and thence, till Morans
time, he was in the boom. But after that
lie vegetated among the abos. at Moruya till
Arch. Kelly, recognising his value, brought
him to Newtown, on the death of Rev. Dr.
Murphy—who, as President of the Car-
dinals’ College at Manly, was the victim of
one of “Hop’s” best clerical cartoons.
“Gallery”: The new House of Reps, will
miss the fluttering coat-tails of ex-P.M.G.
Wise. He was always in a devil of a hurry,
and this suggestion of momentous business
awaiting him round the corner was aug-
mented when he became a Minister. One
recess I encountered him late at night
at Parliament House, scrambling up-
stairs, wide-eyed, breathless and dishevelled.
He had motored a couple of hundred miles
to attend the funeral of Palmer, a former
member for Echuca (Vic.), and was coming
in to a quiet spot to start his day’s work.
When in Melbourne he put up at a pub near
the House, and there is a legend of his get-
ting up in the early morning to return to his
office to rubber-stamp some document he had
overlooked. Indefatigable and conscientious,
he was a model of political propriety. When
lie was kicked out of Hughes’s Cabinet for
purely party reasons, he felt the ejection
keenly, but to the pressmen hovering round
him he uttered no word of complaint. “To
mention one’s feelings in this connection,”
he said afterwards, “would establish a grave
precedent.” Poynton, his successor (also
sacked by an ungrateful electorate), is a very
different man. He used to be an amiable
and restful character, but office inflated his
vanity, and his manner of speech developed
a tinge of patronage. Also, he became
rather affected in his walk whenever he
entered the Chamber. To see Poynton stroll-
ing in languidly, with one fat hand in the
top pocket of his pants, was to suspect that
he was practising for a Windsor uniform.
“Morehead” holds a review:—
In the new House of Reps, agrarians are well to
the fore. There are 14 farmers and three graziers,
and R. F. H. Green the new G.P. man for Richmond
(N.S.W.) owns to being both a farmer and grazier.
With half-a-dozen apiece the solicitors and “secre-
taries” tie for second place. Barristers come next
with four, then follow journalists, doctors and
merchants (three apiece), and a pair each of
orchardists, miners, agents and investors. For the
rest there are a provision merchant, manager, school
teacher, clerk, grocer, plumber, estate-agent, plast-
erer, draper, storekeeper, traveller, tailor, electrical
engineer, watchmaker, patternmaker, artist, manu-
facturer, auctioneer, greengrocer, accountant, lock-
maker, chemist; retired public servant and a “parlia-
mentarian.” The last-named is old Fred Bamford,
M.H.R. for Herbert (Q.). As be has represented
that seat from 1901 his claim that politics is his
living is granted. .Two labor men, Gabb and Blake-
ley. described themselves respectively as “legislator”
and “M.H.R.” Out of the 14 C.P. men 10 repre-
sent fanning or grazing interests.
BALLADE OF THE SONS OF REUBEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Reuben, my first-born... .unstable as water, tbou
sbalt not excel.” —Gen. xlix, v. 3-4.
That is the; curse that ever on us lies;
The (loom our father Jacob laid of old:
Heavy with death that clogged his closing eyes.
Loudly his best-belovCd he extolled, i
To him he hated and who failed, he doled
Small comfort, as the ancient story runs;
So here we stand, the outcasts from the fold —
Pity us brothers —we are Reuben’s sons.
We, in our heat, begin with high emprise;
Though they that know our breeding scoff and scold,
We are the Captains of the Wild Surmise;
VVe are the vanguard of The Overbold.
Till, when our gainings prove but fairy gold.
Dead leaves a wilhered in unwholesome suns,
Back to the chains our stolid gangs are 60ld ;
Pity us brotheis —we are Reuben’s sons.
Eager, always, to grasp the pregnant prize;
Ever forestalled when Fume her tale has told;
Foolishly.- rash and weakly overwise;
Others the fireside gain and we the cold.
Dull toads beneath the harrow are we rolled :
We muster to the thunder of the guns;
But what we gain, the better braggers hold—
Pity us brothers —we are Reuben’s sons.
* • Envoy.
For Reuben’s lands are six short feet of mould:
For many a jnile his brethren's portion runs.
We are the Legion of the Lost Enrolled—
Pity us brothers —we are Reuben’s sons.

“Dear me, father will never go to Heaven
if he swears like that, will he? ”
“That must be why angels always have
whiskers, mother."
“Flicker”: These accounts of suicide
among animals in Tiie Bulletin lately have had a
bad effect in at least one case. On December 5,
Barley Prince, a fairly well-known racehorse in S.
Aus., went and “feloniously killed and murdered
himself” at Glenelg. The Prince was having a swim
off the beach, in charge of a boy, when he suddenly
plunged, unseated his guardian, and swam out into
deep water. In spite of every effort to save him, he
carried out his purpose. There doesn’t seem to be
any motive for his act; his health appeared good,
and he was expected to win at Gawler on the 9th.
1 don’t know whether his trainer, Krogdahl, intends
to take action against the Abo. Council for inspir-
ing the animal to his rash act., or whether he will
accept a verdict of “temporary insanity” and let
it go at that.
• * » *
“Ivay”: I was once present at a mixed
marriage out N. Territory way—a white man on
the run saying “I will” to a black lady. The C.P.B.
at Pine Creek tied the knot and afterwards the
couple found a spread awaiting them. At the end
of the feast the bridegroom stood up, casually cocked
a spurred boot on to his stool, and made a speech.
We gathered that he was very pleased with the con-
tract he had made, and was entering same with
his eyes open. He talked on a while foolishly,
as men do on such occasions, and then, handing
the marriage certificate over to his wife, concluded
like this: “Mary, maybe you no savee white man
law; you keepit that feller paper altogether;
suppose me bin clear out bhne-bye you take-it paper
longa police—he bin fetchum me back longa you.”
* * * *
“O’North”: Recently, in Toowoomba (Q.),
a lightning flash instantaneously set the water in
two 1000-gallon iron tanks at boiling point. About
one quarter of the water was dissipated in steam.
Is this anywhere near a record?
* * * *
“R. 8.” : I’m not out to start another cat-
rabbit argument, but just to remark that the man-
ager of Vindex station, Winton (Q.), the other day
had his attention drawn to a cross between a sheep
and a goat. The animal’s body has more the shape
of a jumbuck, but the head and legs closely resemble
those of Stinker’s progeny. On being examined by
Q. Gov. Analyst Henderson, the “fleece’’ turned out
to have the characteristics of both wool and hair,
the lower part of the fibre showing all the qualities
of strong hair, while the tip, to a depth of an inch,
closely resembles wool. Stranger still, at the breech
ends of this “fleece” the structure of the fibre (show-
ing no scales whatever) is like neither wool nor
hair.
* * * *
"McJ.”: Just to finally' settle that old
argument about sharks not tackling colored people.
Off Thursday Island, on Nov. 6, a New Guinea
“boy” was attacked and horribly mutilated by a
shark. The maneater was driven off, but the nig.
died before they got him out of the water.
* * * *
“Gilgi”: Re “Barcoo” (B. 16/11/’22) on
camping cattle. I’ve had over 40 years of droving,
with both “inside” and “outside” stock, and 1 have
found that if you want cattle to camp you must
feed and water them well and not overdrive them.
If you have a long dry stage to do, start early and
let them get over the bad part as soon as possible.
It may be advisable to string them; if so, steady
the lead, and then, if you can give them a good
drink and a feed, they’ll camp like fed sheep.
Experience has taught me to avoid a ddsty or soft
camp ; a hard or even a stony one is preferable. A
’possum, bandicoot or falling limb will start a
mob. I have seen 1200 bullocks jump as one. It,
isn’t the fear of the thing making the sudden noise
—for possibly only one beast has been frightened
it is the natural instinct of self-preservation that
makes the mob go. The real fear is that of being
trampled on by the others. In the case of a dusty
camp, after you steady the mob and are ringing
them up, the dust rises in clouds and half blinds
them, and the chances are they’ll keep fizzing all
night. I use only a camp tire—not lanterns ; I don’t
go nap on that idea —and I insist on the men carry-
ing a whip and making a noise when on watch.
* ■» * *
“Billy Buttins”: Most bushmen commence
to feel self-conscious at this period about the annual
wash. To avert another year’s delay tell “Jimmy
Trousers” (B. 14/12/’22) that the best bush substi-
tute for soap is the reddish gum exuding from
stringy-bark trees. This product contains free
alkali, and lathers freely. Almost any bush tree
such as box, messmate or stringy will supply the
goods. Water is also recommended.
» * * *
“Malokihi” (Papua) : Frank Hurley was
wise to abandon the idea of flying from the coast
to Lake Murray. Imagine a craft like a seaplane
attempting to anchor in either the Fly or Strickland
rivers in flood—-and they are pretty well always
in flood. Out of the gloom of those vast streams
heavy timber comes hurtling down at six knots.
1 have been up there in a strong 30-ton launch and
had to keep the coxswain on the helm all night,
just as if we were under way. Capt. Lang’s flight
from Kaimare to Daru, under most' dangerous atmo-
spheric conditions, was a wonderful performance,
but the Lake Murray trip would have been sheer
suicide. It is surprising to those familiar with
local conditions that the idea should ever have
been mooted.
* « * *
“Allbutt”: “Trevdee’s” jumping jumbuck
(B. 16/11/’22) recalls that I was once driving along
a bush track when I overtook a mob of sheep, and,
as usuab they all started to make across in front
of me. One, however, took a flying leap and landed
fair into the bottom of the sulky. He made no
attempt to move till I pulled up.
“3130”: I’ve been coming a thud with
most of the ant exterminators suggested by the
Abo. council last summer. My stock are the real
inch-long red and black bulldogs, and have had
a nest under the house for years. They won’t
come at cyanide or tartar or anything sweet, and
if any Abo. can supply a real knock-out for them
I’ll toast him in bumpers.
* * * #
“W.D.G.”: “Pick” (B. 23/11/’22) isn't
fair to the native grasses when he says they are
hard and tough. The greater parts of N.S.W., Q.,
W.A. and S.A. have a big variety of quick-growing
soft grasses. What imported stuff can fatten stock
as quickly as button, blue, Mitchell, Flinders and
umbrella grasses ? —just to mention a few of the
natives. And as for making stock gummy early
in life, I’ve seen horses and cattle over 20 years
old who have never even heard of a dentist.
HER DAY OFF.
“Where’er yer gain', Bill?"
“Jus' talcin' our mare out ter glee 'er a feed er grass."
“Chinook”: In spite of the assertion of
“FY7” as to the courage of the Scotch deer-hound
(B. 26/10/’22), I agree with “Yammon” that the
subject is debatable. In the early nineties, in
Western America, I had as a neighbor an English
ranching' Co., which was incurring heavy losses
through the depredations of wolves, and the manage-
ment imported from Scotland a pack of 10 deer-
hounds, fine big dogs, averaging over 31in. These
caught and killed the coyote or prairie-wolf (Cants
latrans) readily enough, but they could never be
induced to face the grey wolf (Cants lupus), the
real cause of the co.’s losses. The deer-hound may-
be a great performer upon his native heather, but,
transplanted across the Atlantic, he too often adopted
the “too proud to fight” attitude.
* * * *
“Ashmead” : Ever heard of “Ninety,” the
champion eater of the Speck? He is the pride of
the North-East, and his gastronomic achievements are
known all Over the island. He once had the job
of looking after a place in the boss’s absence, and
was told to feed on the sheep. The boss returned
in about three months, and found that he was 00
sheep short. The yarn is that “Ninety” got out-
side one a day. Another man, hearing of this,
made a wager with a speculator that the gourmaud
could get outside a sheep at a sitting. To give
himself an extra chance of winning, he had the
carcase made up into tasty patties, and set the
huge pile of them in front of “Ninety.” The
champion put away all the patties but three, and
stopped. His supporter begged him to go on and
finish the lot, but without avail. “I’d like to,” said
“Ninety,” “but you see I’ve got to eat a sheep
soon, and I want a bit of room left!”
TIE TOOK IT.
“A man should never ask for money. What
brought you to this?"
“Not askin' for it."
“Pro” : Do wombat burrows inter-com-
municate like those of a rabbit warren? About
20 years ago a farmer at Millthorpe (N.S.W.)
was draining a basin-like depression in one of his
cultivation paddocks, finding his levels by allowing
the water to run along the drain as he dug it.
About half-way through the rise he struck an
old wombat hole and the drainage to the extent
of about an acre cleared itself off down the burrow.
He terminated the drain there, and the patch has
never been waterlogged since, although the hole
was on the basin slope. The only conclusion which
suggests itself is that it connected by an under-
ground system with the creek over the rise. But
what is the origin of these basin-like depressions
on the top of so many undulations in that district
anyway? Are they old ’bat colonies?
* # * *
“H.P.”: My little entry for the record
clip-:- Seven sheep shorn this year filled a bale with
over 3001 b. of wool. I’ll be frank and explain that
the seven jumbucks were away on Maria Island
(Tas.), and had been out of touch with the barber
for four years. One yielded over 501 b. of wool, and
the other six made up the bale. The stuff was sold
to the woollen mills at 3<}d. a lb., being almost
valueless.
“Allbutt”: There is a small shrub growing
profusely around Wyong and Gosford (N.S.W.),
running to about a foot high with green leaves and
a reddish flower. The stem contains a white milky
juice something like that exuded from the thistle,
and local inhabitants tell tales of the wonderful
curative properties of this stuff. I myself know
of one man who had a black-bluish scar which
started on the tip of his nose and gradually spread
all over one side of his face. Doctors failed to
cure or stop it, all putting it down to internal
growth. But the milk of this plant shifted it in
less than a month, and his face is. now 7 as clear as
a newborn baby’s. Possibly the shrub grows along
the coast, but I’m sure it’s not out back. What
does the Council know about it?
* * * #
"Sucre”: A black snake, 4ft. long, climbed
to the top of a beehive at my place at Merinda
(N.Q.). Every bee that had a sting handy assaulted
him. He got away from me covered with bee-
spears. Next morning I found him under a clump
of passion-fruit, swollen as big as a poisoned ’pos-
sum, and as dead as he looked.
* * * *
“Te Babarantiko”: The wallaby of N.
Queensland seems exceedingly hard to strangle. At
the Sugar Experiment Station, Meringa, 12 miles
from Cairns, wallabies pushing under the wire-
netting were playing havoc with a crop of coni, so,
making a noose in a length of new 7 galvanised fencing
wire, I arranged a snare in the track under the
netting. Next morning the noose had gone—the
wire was snapped off where it had come against the
taut bottom wire in the fence close to the corner
post. Another snare went the same way, so I tried
new pliable one-inch manila, only to find that a
wallaby had been caught, but had scooped the noose
over his head with the forepaws, and had escaped.
Then I fixed a combination of manila with wire
noose, but the snare remained untouched. Stand-off
signals had evidently been hoisted.

A GOLDEN HOUR.

In the golden noon
(Never was such'weather 1)
All the birds in tune
Make sweet song together.
Town is far away—
Clamor, toil and bustle.
How the tree-tops sway,
llow their red leaves rustle 1
O'er the waving grass
Where I lie contented,
Wandering breezes pass,
Odorous, lemon-scented.
Drowsy beetles wing
Through the sapling bushes ;
Happy warblers sing,
Answering grey thrushes.
In the shine and shade
Dragon-flies are hawking:
Glooming grove and glade.
Sorrow goes not walking.
Though on bush and tree
Leaf and blossom wither,
Vet, it seems to me,
Death comes gently hither.
Leaf and leafy way

What death takes to-day
Life makes good to-morrow.
By no grief deterred,
Knowing heart-break never—
Sing, O butcher-bird,
Sing of joy forever!

“Werrimee”: “S.S.” (B. 7/12/’22), who
claims to have been a drover for 41 years, says:
“.... in an instant all was mad fury, with cattle
bellowing and stampeding in all directions.” I
have had to stop rushes in all weathers and all
sorts of country, but I’ve never known a mob to
scatter when rushing off camp at night. They all
charge in one direction, and it is a marvel how
a thousand bullocks will spring up and all head
one way in the flick of an eyelash. Neither have
I heard a beast utter a sound during a stampede.
The mob becomes noisy, though not always, when
the lead lias been turned and they start ringing.
Every beast has a special mate or two, and after
the mix-up they call out for each other.
“Patonga” : Neville Cayley and other ex-
perts of the R.A.O.U. have come across what looks
like a new variety of mutton-bird on Lion Island
in Broken Bay (N.S.W.). It is like the Maori-
land species, Puffinus griseus, in coloring, but is a
good deal smaller —in fact, it is smaller than the
ordinary mutton-bird of Bass Strait and the Aus-
tralian coasts (P. brevicaudus or tenuirostris). The
eggs (the bird is now breeding on the island) are
slightly smaller than those of the common mutton-
bird.
BLUFFIN’ MANAGER.
“Manager edden game for to sack me. I threatened un if ’e
did I tell ail I do know about ’un.”
“What do ’ce know ’bout ’un, mate.”
“Nawthin'.”
“Huffin-Guffin”: Re the strain of pulling
on the Korumburra (Vic.) roads causing horses to
go blind (B. 7/12/’22). If they use waggons there
now, those roads must have improved a lot since I
lived in the place (1894-96). Then the farmers used
to bring their produce in on sledges. It was quite
a novelty to see a wheeled vehicle outsidj the town.
The only available Sunday walk was along the rail-
way lines. The women wore leggings. (This was
one of my stock yarns when I visited civilisation.
But it is no wonder now. They wear ’em even in
civilised parts!) Everybody going out at night

DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE: “ Would yous mind not making quite so much noise? Father’s
just hung hisself.”
carried a lantern —to avoid mud in winter and snakes
in summer. I helped kill a snake on the railway-
station platform one evening. The tall timber
grew like an old-man ziff all around the town
boundaries. Coal was king. Now, I believe, the
district is a mere milk and butter raiser, with coal
as a side-line.

“Malokihi”: Ever hear of a native-com-
panion as a domestic pet? I saw one in a village
in Western Papua last week holding its own well
with the village curs when scraps were thrown.
Then a woman called to it twice from a neighboring
humpy, and the ungainly creature stalked off to her
and followed her about like a dog.
# #• * *
“Bullswool”: The fossicker had offered
me a bunk in his hut, and as we were turning in
I commented on the fact that he didn’t shake his
bedclothes. “Oh, you needn't be afraid of snakes
here —I’ve got snakebush growing,” he said point-
ing to some bushes near the door. The plant stood
about 3ft. high, was bushy with a leaf like a
geranium but not so fleshy, and it had an odor
like horehound. The ancient swore that no snake
would come near the place, and during the week
I was there I didn’t see any, although they were
plentiful enough in the scrub. Does any Abo. know
the plant?
“Snell”: The urg-
ency of an Act guarantee-
ing better provisions for
guests at many country
hotels in Victoria is certi-
fied by Burt. Burt was
travelling for a firm of
leather merchants carrying
beltings to the sawmillers
and creameries and kindred
out-back industries, and
one day he found himself
at Buck Buck, where there
was one hotel surrounded
by innumerable gums and
several sawmills. They
were dubious about putting
Burt up at the Buck Arms.
Asked w’hat accommodation
he had, the landlord, a
bare-footed boniface in an
old shirt, an ancient pair
of pants, and nought be-
side, replied that he had
beer and rum and whisky.
What further accommoda-
tion could any reasonable
man desire? When Burt
insisted on bed and board,
he was shown into a room
that looked as if it might
have been the stable. That
night, when he got into
the ramshackle bed, some-
thing crashed, and, on
rising and obtaining a
light to investigate, the
lodger found he had over-
lain a clutch of 11
chickens, just on the point
of vacating the shell. The
nest was disposed in the
straw mattress. Next night
Burt slept in a rug on the
roof of the cowshed.
“Cordon Noir”: The general experience is
that the native bear will not live long in captivity.
But one Teddy recently expired at Windsor (Vic.)
after a captivity of over 10 years. He was caught
young and lived under natural conditions. A female
of the species once dropped in, kept him company
for a couple of weeks, and as suddenly disappeared.
The longest stretch I had previously heard of a pet
koala living was three years. In that case the
natural diet of gum-leaves was supplemented with
fruit and cereal food.
“Mulgaite”: How’s this for a record in
elevation? An old kangarooer at Doyles’ Well (W.A.),
having purchased a new Winchester rifle, decided
to try it out. He sauntered to the back of his
camp, selected a sapling about Bin. in diameter,
and marked it with a cross about 3ft. from the
ground. After stepping out 200yds. the test started.
The first shot penetrated the sapling where the
horizontal and perpendicular lines of the cross met.
The second shot was slightly to the rigflit but on
the horizontal line, and the third shot was a little
to the left, but also a line ball. After ten rounds
had been poured into the sapling it fell. While
the old fellow was examining his handiwork a
stranger happened along, looked at the stump and
remarked: “Blime mate, the bloke wot sharpened
the saw that cut that sapling was a bonzer saw
doctor.”

“V.C.” : “Jimmy Trousers’s” filthy Chris-
tian feeling (B. 14/12/’22) is due to the fact that
ordinary water is not a solvent for the oily excre-
tions from the skin. Next time the go. takes
his soap let him try a little soft wood-ash from the
camp fire. King Billy assures me that this was used
by his ancestors for generations before white pfeller
soap was heard of.
* * * *
“A.G.L.”: “Borom” (B. 30/11/’22) in
recommending a two per cent, solution of picric
acid for swamp cancer in horses is evidently un-
aware that a saturated solution of this acid is only,
approximately, one per cent. (1.1 p.c.). It’s also
worth while mentioning that picric acid and its
combinations (picrates) are intensely explosive in
a dry state, and, like fulminates, enter largely into
h.e. preparations, lyddite being an instance. By-
keeping a few crystals undissolved in a bottle of
water and replacing acid or water as necessary- a
(safe) saturated solution is always available. Re-
cent burns treated with gauze wetted with this
strength solution always do well. The characteristic
yellow staining soon wears off.
* * * *
“T.V.T.”: The Abo. Council has discussed
almost every conceivable kind of record, but I can’t
recall having read of the prize maize-picking tally.
I am told that gun-huskers on the Snowy (N.S.W.)
do up to 50 bags a day; and one super-gun at
Lindenow (Vic.) husked 55 bags. Personally, the
best tally I know of is 41 bags, and it was not
done in an eight-hour day either. The man who
did it was a Eurythmic among those opposed to him,
and no one can convince me that he was practising
the darg.
* # * *
“Azrim” : As I was once stung by a bee
belonging to a bloke who had over .400 hives, I can
talk with authority. Green-colored honey (B.
14/12/’22) is garnered mainly from red-gum, tea-
tree or the quaint yellow-flowering shrub known in
the Horsham district (Vic.) as the “yakker bush” ;
but most Aussies prefer the light-colored honey won
from box blossoms. The bees constantly need pollen
to feed their young, which are always being pro-
duced, since the workers live only six or eight
weeks, and, when the pollen supply from the euea-
lypts, cape-weed, dandelion, etc., runs short, the
apiarist has to supply an adequate substitute.
“Lenah” (B. 14/12/’22) suggests peameal, but
cocoa is easily first. The native black or “bush
bees,” while good toilers, are as savage as a poli-
tician who has last his seat; so most of the hives
are Italians, which are more tractable. (In this
connection it’s interesting to note how the Dago
freezes on to sugar in Bananaland.) A good hive
collects six or seven pounds of honey daily, and I
know of one that gathered 151 b. in 24 hours. But
blossoms were plentiful, and there was no 6 o’clock
closing in those days.
* * * *
“Corrimal” : Re “C.R.D.’s” challenge (B.
14/12/’22) about a man being lighter after a heavy
meal than before it. It is, of course, sheer nonsense,
but to clamp the argument I have actually tested
it. Two men on Thursday and three men on Friday
weighed themselves carefully before eating their
dinner; then weighed their dinner; then ate their
dinner, and finally weighed themselves again. rhe
dinner in each case was about 21b. in weight of
food and drink, and in each of the fiva cases the
final weighing showed an increase in weight exactly
corresponding to the weight of the food and drink
consumed.
* * * *
“Malleeite”: How is this for a sheep-
droving performance? A Melbourne man, whose ex-
perience with jumbucks had previously been
limited to butchers’ shops and dinner tables,
undertook for a friend, with whom he was
spending a holiday, to drive a mob of
shorn lambs from West Warburton to Walsh’s
Creek (22 miles). The day (December 8) was one
of the hottest of the year, and the unfenced track
passed through some of the roughest country in Vic.
He started at 9 a.m. and had the job finished, with
correct count, by 5 p.m. Odds of 100 to 1 could
easily have been obtained about him getting through
in the day.
* * * *
“Adrem” : A queer case of foster-mother-
ing recently happened at Palmerston North (M.L.).
A pair of young thrushes in the original nest were
removed to a box in an enclosed porch, and a black-
bird, hearing tlieir calls, visited them, then promptly
started the hopeless task of keeping their vociferous
appetites appeased. For four days she worked like
a nigger coming boldly into the porch with rapid
relays of tucker. On the fifth day, looking worn and
haggard, she slung in the job, and the thrushes have
since been fed by hand. As the youngsters are some-
what darker than the usual fledgling, it has been
suggested that they are a thrush-blackbird cross;
though I don’t think so.
“Wilfrido”: We hear a lot about camels;
but when it comes to lack of water horses aren’t so
bad. During the advance from Beersheba to Jaffa
(Palestine) the M.L.M.R. Brigade was without water
for 72 hours, several regiments in the two Australian
brigades were without it for 60 hours, and one cable-
waggon team from D.H.Q. knew it as a minus quan-
tity for 84 hours. During these periods, the horses
had heavy work over rough country, and did an
average of 20 miles a day. The cable-waggon team
suffered the most, losing much of their vigor after
36 hours; but they quickly recovered. The chief
trouble lay in the issue of grain for five consecutive
days, this leading to diarrhoea and laminitis. The
figures I give can be checked by General Chaytor’s
report of February, 1918.
* * * *
“Sport”: How long can a fish live out of
water? I beg to nominate the stone-fish, known as
“the death-adder of the sea.” I recently speared one
at Magnetic Island (N.Q.), and threw it on a rubbish
heap. When I examined it 23 hours later I found it
to be very much alive, and I despatched it per
medium of the fire.
FAMILY AMENITIES.
UNCLE JOE : “Do you know wot becomes of
silly young fools wot arsks idiotic ques-
tions?”
ANGELIC WILLIE : “Yus; they grows up to
be silly old fools wot goes on arshin’
’em.”
“Verde Gris’s” glimpse of the Never-
Never :
Tanami is a desolate goldfield in the N. Territory
about half-way from anywhere north or south, and, as
it lies toward the W.A. border, it deals chiefly with
Hall’s Creek, 220 miles away. Two brothers have
been the only inhabitants for several years, and a
recent rumor that they have been killed by natives
leaves their existence in doubt. Six months ago,
when one of them went the 200 miles up the street
to the grocer’s for the yearly knob of blue and had
been gone about a month, the one who stayed behind
was attacked by blacks, but managed to come out cf
it with a smashed finger and a cut on the head from
a boomerang. Subsequently, the policeman whose
beat includes the 400 miles between Wave Hill and
Tanami, went out after the niggers, but had to
give it up for lack of water. When Tanami was
discovered, the natives said the roekholes there
“never died,” but scarcity of water depopulated the
field more than once during the days of the first
alluvial finds. The tracks to the place are just
as bad, and have accounted for at least half-a-dozen
men. The two who stuck to it have had to treat
their ore by dry-blowing and themselves by dry-
cleaning. They deserve a better fate than to be
speared for the tucker in their camp.
THE DAY SEEKER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They showed her grave beneath the trees;
But he, because he saw her face
Radiant with last year's memories,
Turned smiling from the leafy place.
And as he turned he heard her call
His name with laughter from the hill;
The shadows on the grass were tall,
The setting sun was red and still.
The pale priest watched him go his way
And sighed with close-pressed finger tips;
Yet, pitying, wondered at the gay
And sudden whistle on his lips.
The hill in plumes of glory drest
Blazed the full triumph day had won;
He strode into the crimson west,
Half man, half flame against the sun.
The priest along the beaten track
Went softly with a strange, slow look,
So heavy seemed the mortal load
Upon his heart of one small book.
Above her head the grasses wave,
The grey thrush knows the quiet place;
But how should he regard her grave
Who heard her voice and saw her face?
Dust unto dust. The thin airs fill
With thinner sighs, and day is done —
1 saw a lover on the hill
Who walked in glory to the sun!

LETTER

Itose Scott thinks that the fates played
her a cruel trick at Christmas. Her usual
party had to be put off owing to a bad leg,
which she mysteriously acquired while gar-
dening. But, enthroned in an armchair like
a queen, at her Woollalira cottage, she
received devoted subjects who came to pay
her homage, and to lay their Christmas offer-
ings at her feet. Beside the bountiful lady
was a great basket, in which was a season-
able gift for each caller. Justice Rich was
one of her Christmas Eve entertainers, and
fie had a good story to tell of the League of
Nations. One of Rose Scott’s most
treasured gifts this year is a sheaf of after-
dinner stories sent her by Lady Aberdeen.
They are the yarns swapped by Lord Aber-
deen and Sir James Taggart at an annual
story competition, at which all the diners
vote as to which is the better raconteur ,
This year Aberdeen was the winner, and his
spouse proudly passed the stories on to her
Australian friend.
The lady who lives in Macleay-street had
a disturbed rest on Christmas Eve. All
through the night carols were blared or sung
or fiddled outside her window. At 5 o’clock
she fell asleep, only to be wakened at C with
“Christians Awake!” “And,” she says bit-
terly, “I wished to Heaven I were a
Jewess.”
Frank Coffee has found out a few things
about Western American life, and is rather
agitated over his discovery that it is illegal
to sell cigarettes in Utah, and that the
largest pub in Salt Lake City was origi-
nally erected as a home for the plurality
spouses of Mormon husbands —but the plus
wives preferred their own little homes in the
West Frank had as travelling companion
on one of his train journeys a woman lawyer
from Nevada. This lady, who had started
out in life as a school-teacher, acquired her
legal knowledge in a correspondence course
with a University, and claims that her law
trade to-day fluctuates between 8000 and
10,000 dahlers. Nevada’s chief source of
income is divorce, so when the Church of
England bishop put up a fight at a recent
election, against lax divorce laws, he was
beaten by six to one. About 80 divorces
a month are granted to outsiders, who are
compelled to reside in the State for six
months, and the lowest legal fee for the
breaking of the bonds is 150 dollars. Mary
Pickford’s case cost 25,000 dollars. Mary
made a slip in the witness-box when proving
that she had some interest in the State. She
had some shares in a gold-mine, but swore
to having shares in a coal-mine. As there
is no coal within 1000 miles, the position
needed some explanation.
Twelve months ago this Letter had a line
about a first-year med., Alan Canny, who had
swept up all the prizes in his year. The
extraordinary young man, only son of J. P.
Canny, of the National Bank, did something
even more remarkable this year. For once
in a way he fell sick, and had to take his
exams, in bed, under supervision ; yet he was
the only candidate to win “high distinction”
—and it would have looked higher than that
if it could have been mentioned that Canny
was running a temp, of 101° during part of
the examination.
Beatrice Osmond, the young English-
woman who is saving Ken Wood, the estate
of the Earl of Mansfield, as a breathing
space for the people of London, passed
through Sydney this week. The estate,
which adjoins ‘Ampstead ’Eatli, and
is only 4£ miles outside the city,
was about to fall into the hands of
the jerry-builder and flat-speculator, when
Miss Osmond returned from war work in
France. Her father had been organising sec.
for the preservation of the Heath as a recrea-
tion ground for the worker and his family,
so the daughter felt that it was up to her
to strike another blow in defence of the
people’s lungs, for the Heath is a sadly-
overcrowded place these bank holidays. She
plunged in, and got together a committee
which has the Earl of Plymouth for its presi-
dent and includes half the Peerage and the
leading financial men of London ; and with
the help of her own charm, plus this back-
ing, she has collected £135,000 towards her
object. The entire estate, which comprises
part of the ancient forest of Middlesex, will
cost £340,000; and when Beatrice returns
to England after her Australian tour, her
smile and gentle insistence are going to
gather in the remaining shekels. As it is
over 100 acres have been presented to the
London County Council. Miss Osmond
goes to visit her niece, Nancy Masterman,
who is the big noise among the Girl Guides
of the Apple Island.
Frederick Waley, who got a knighthood
last week, deserved the gaud more than
most —assuming always it is something to
be thankful for. He really did war-work
during the war, and wore his naval uniform
as a Coal Board rep. with the air of a
Nelson. And when the war ended, and
war-work ceased to he fashionable, he not
only gave his time but his money to the
men who had fought. The Waley Red
Cross Home at Picton was his munificent
Mi-
llis wife, in addition to being a great
charity worker, is noted for being one
of Sydney’s handsomest dressers. She
has the sort of figure that can wear a tailor-
made with distinction, and the clear com-
plexion that dares to wear a black hat even
when the rest of her frocking is black or
navy blue. She is a member of most of the
women’s clubs, has a quick sense of humor,
and more than a talent for organising.
Tal Ordell, Ginger Mick of “The Senti-
mental Bloke,” had a queer experience the
other night. As he emerged from the stage
alleyway, he nearly ran up against two
blokes who were helping to supnort the en-
trance. “H’lo,” one of them breathed hoarsely,
“Guess y’ don’t kinder remember me, but
I useter know you when you was in the
bottle trade in Lil’ Bourke —knew yer the
minnit I lamped yer on the stage.” lie
poked the astounded Tal’s midribs. “A fair
break-up that’s wot y’are.” Then he stood
back and murmured something about “a
knock-out,” while the other bloke pushed
forward a bulky parcel. “For y’r supper.
Just a mouthful o’ cray and a gargle o’
beer. Goin’ back ter Melbourne ter-morrer.
I’ll tell the boys y’r a fair scream.” Tal
rose to the occasion, took his bouquet with
the right shade of thanks, shook hands twice
round with each of the lads, and boarded
the back of a passing tram.
Dora Gillam, 8.A., who is leaving to take
charge of a new secondary school in S. Aus.,
has been the reason for a great brewing of
the tea-leaf in educational circles. She is
one of the strongest supports of the Modern
Languages Association, and has such profici-
ency in tongues that she has mastered the
intricacies of saying farewell in evei'y living
language two of the dead ones, and even in
Esperanto.
Marjorie Pride, pictured herewith,
possesses a soprano for which big things
in opera were predicted by Rosina Buck-
man and Maurice
d'Oisly when they
heard the young Mos-
man singer at Mrs.
G. B. Piddington’s re-
cently. For many
years Marjorie has
given her services to
patriotic and chari-
table institutions,
but most of all to
the Soldiers’ Wel-
come, the Soldiers’
Club and the Raw-
son Institute for
Seamen, where she
has helped at liter-
ally hundreds of con-
certs. She was one
of the dozen pupils
of Mrs. Hugh Ward
selected to sing the Ode when Edward P.
attended the gala performance at Her
Majesty’s, and she won from over 200
entrants Ruby Youngman’s soprano scholar-
ship. Most of the big country centres
know her voice, and not so long ago she
took it along to West Maitland for the
Hibernian festival, where the populace de-
manded an encore, holus bolus, and got it.
Kate Harriott, who is registered under
the A.T.N.A. as a- teacher of invalid cookery,
has just brought out a book of Invalid and
Convalescent Cookery. If anybody knows
her job surely Kate does, for she is the lec-
turer on her special ways of preparing food
to the leading Sydney hospitals, and to many
in the suburbs and the country. Her book
doesn’t altogether confine itself to catering
for sick-room fancies; there are dozens of
recipes that many people staggering with
health will enjoy.
Enid D’Arcy opened in Ballarat with the
Lionel Walsh-Phil Smith co. on Boxing
Day in “Cinderella.” The pretty Mel-
bourne girl is making her first flight as the
Fairy Queen, and after the panto, she is
cast for leading parts in musical comedy.
The co. is to tour Victoria, Tasmania, M.L.
and Bananaland.
A suggestion from an Aussie girl in The
Big Smoke: —
Why aren’t there any “social-help” bureaus, on the
lines of “The Aunts,” to be found in any of the six
Australian capital cities? In London and in at least
a dozen other big towns in England one is sure to
find a branch of some “social help” agency. Take
one, “The Useful Women,” which has branches in
London, Paris and Brighton. Here are a few of its
thousand and one activities: Bazaars and concerts
organised, children met and taken to destination,
china mended, servants provided, heraldic and genea-
logical researches made, envelopes addressed, hand-
kerchiefs, blouses and lace washed, table decorations,
books reported on, public speakers provided, emer-
gency guests introduced for dinner-parties, Christ-
mas gifts recommended, libraries catalogued and
secretarial work done, mending for bachelors, and
socks darned. There should be plenty of room for
some enterprising matron to set going something
on the same lines in Sydney or Melbourne.
Herewith Eric Howell, one of the most
versatile of the Repertory Players. He first
drew pointed attention to himself by his
work in “Rosmer-
sholm,” when he
played the difficult
part of Rosmer. The
other week he played
the stranger in E. J.
Mulgan’s “For Love
of Appin,” and just
before that he had
made a hit with the
Mos m a n Musical
Society as Rakel in
“Monsieur B e a u-
caire,” while many
have pleasant recol-
lections of him as
the irascible Ameri-
can, Peter Dodder, in
“The Pursuit of
Pamela.” Eric has
toured the East with
a company of enter-
tainers, and learned his Queensland as a mem-
ber of Philip Lytton’s melodrama eo. In
the space of less than a year he has been a
stage Dane, Scot, Frenchman and American,
but he himself was born in Belfast, where
his father, John 11. Howell, was the head-
master of the Royal Academical Institute.
Incidentally, he edits the Coastal Farmers’
magazine, and runs their social and dramatic
clubs.
Housekeepers will send up a cheer on
learning that the old “War Chest Cookery-
book” is again on the market under a new
name. It’s to be known as the “Kindergarten
Cookery-book,” and the whole of the pro-
ceeds of the sales will go to clearing off the
debt on the new building of the Surry Hills
Free Kindergarten. Over 100 new and tried
recipes have been added to the original signed
and favorite dishes, and the little volume is
on sale at all booksellers.
“Princess Ilerminie and the Tapestry
Prince” is another book of fairy-tales pro-
duced in Australia. The stories are the
flowers of Lee Ivatt’s brain, while the grace-
ful and imaginative illustrations are the
work of Barbara Macdonald. The dainty
production carries the hall-mark of an Art
Tn Australia publication.
News from London tells that Gladys
Verona has been admitted into the select
circle of principals of the Carl Rosa Opera
Co. at Covent Garden. The musical man
of the Daily Telegraph congratulates the
directors on having “secured a genuine find
in this young Australian soprano.” _ He
sums her up as “a really accomplished
coloratura singer and a very valuable asset,”
and further suggests that an opera co. com-
posed exclusively of Australian singers
would make a big hit in England. It would
certainly be a highly interesting experiment
and might prove a very profitable one. The
D.T. musical critic adds: “Singers from
Australia —and what fine voices they all
have! —seem to be coming here in a never-
ceasing flow.”
An angry rentpayer writes from Lon-
don :
The par. in “A Woman’s Letter” (B. 10/8/’22),
describing a Sydney girl's wanderings through “a
wilderness of ‘To Lets’,” in London, is, to Austra-
lians here, the jest of the season. I recently had to
cast around for a house or flat to let, and can tes-
tify that such a thing isn’t to be had, unfurnished,
within 20 miles of London, under four guineas a
week. There are plenty of furnished flats and
houses, but even for the most suburban type, such as
3 7 0 u find at Hammersmith,. Acton or Kew Gardens,
five guineas is the minimum. For a furnished flat
in a fashionable quarter, like Eaton Square, where
“a Sydney girl” alleges, she found a luxurious fur-
nished flat, complete with maid, going begging for
four guineas, the minimum is 10 to 20 guineas, with
premium. The late Sir Henry Wilson, Lord Birken-
head and Winston Churchill all had, or have, town
houses in Eaton-square, and the idea that a four-
guinea furnished flat could be had in that Bel-
gravian resort is a scream.
Just before Christmas Clarence Bridge took
unto himself a bride, Florence Beatrice Pope
(of those Popes who. own a big slice of
Farmer’s). The wedding was at Manly, and
the feast thereof was spread at the Norman
Popes’. The bridegroom is a son of wool-
trader Clarence Bridge, wears the officer’s
uniform of a naval engineer, and Was origi-
nally in the Australia, then in the Parra-
matta, and. is now stationed in the Sydney.
The bush-fires on the Mountains lightened
up the first few days of the honeymoon, and
now the pair seek Hobart, he travelling on
his warship, while she journeys in loneliness
by the ordinary brand of passenger transport.
Airman Nigel B. Love recently asked
Phyllis Eloise Davey, eldest daughter of the
A. Daveys, of Homebush, to ’plane through
life with him, and the reply was in the
affirmative. He was a pilot in the A.F.C.
in France, and since his return has been en-
gaged in the flving business. He is a son
of the John Loves, who live next door to
the bride-elect’s folk.
A young business woman was untying her
Christmas parcels when she came across a
pretty little vanity case. With it was a card
from one of her richest friends. “Isn t
it beautiful?” cooed the receiver. “So gener-
ous of Mrs. A.” “Why,” exclaimed her rela-
tion, looking at the glittering case, “it’s just
like the one you gave Betty B. last year.”
“So it is,” agreed the business girl, still
fumbling with the different push buttons.
Presently a stiff compartment on the top
flew open, and out popped the card of Betty
B. presenting the case with best wishes to
Mrs. A. Another demonstration of the “Cast
your bread upon the waters” theory.
Hermie Ivatt who was (now Mrs. Ivam
Morton) is introducing a baby Morton to
Sydney sights from an eyrie' at the Metro-
pole. She is a Bathurst girl, and before
her marriage, in the intervals of war work,
lampooned friend and foe alike in clever
verse that ran to amazing Gilbertian rhymes.
Lucy Manning came back in time to have
Christmas dinner with her mother at the
Blaclcstone, Elizabeth Bay, after spending
a year in Europe. Her proudest possession
is a frock which cost her 12s. fid. in Berlin :
and her most astonishing experience was
when she went to a bank in Vienna to
change £l5 English into Austrian money.
The equivalent was presented to her on
something resembling a motor-lorry.
Pretty Marjorie Hill Osborne sailed by
the Osterley for England. She is said to
have had some flattering offers from film
magnates in London, and she also carries a
commission to buy in Paris and London for
a big Sydney fluff firm. It was this scheme
that made her turn down the Firm’s offer
to appear in “Sally” in the part originally
written in New York for Dolores, of the
Ziegfeld Follies. Mrs. Tom Dixson is on
the same boat.
Bedecked in soft white satin and georgette,
and wearing her mother’s wedding veil
(which, incidentally, had crowned over 20
previous brides), Iris, younger bud of the
Addison Flowers, of Sakui, North Sydney,
and for a long time assistant teacher to
Lawrence Campbell, in Sydney and New-
castle. said “I will” to Bobert Ramsay, who
is a Ballarat lawyer. She met him when
she was there adjudicating at the Eisteddfod
three years ago, and the wedding happened
on December 20 at the Bourke-street Con-
gregational Church, Padre C. White tying
the knot. Una Flower and Meg Ramsay
bridesmaided, and Jack Ridley and Leslie
Holesgrove looked after the groom’s in-
terests. At their end-of-the-year gathering
the Campbell students presented the young
woman with a silver tea-and-eoffee service.
The pair are honeymooning in the Speck, but
the wedding presents will be unpacked for
keeps in the new home at Ballarat.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Sir Matt, ate his Christmas turkey with Mrs.
Lumley Hill, Violet McCawley, Dr. and Mrs. Glyn
Connolly and Captain Hammond, at Bellevue station.
Most of Brisbane either scaled the hills or went
down to the sea without ships. ’ The Blue Mountains
(N.S.W.) lured quite a number south, including
the E. A. Douglases. Major-General Bill Glasgow
and his lady passed through on Christmas eve en
route to Gympie. Col. and Mrs. Cameron are at
Southport, and Mrs. Wessie Walsh entertains Nell
Tully there.
A blazing sun took toll of white skins during
holidays, and the line of the bathing suit is now
firmly drawn at evening functions. But some smart
showers fell on Boxing Day, and Lute and Jean
Drummond, under the guidance of Star Eglinton,
and Cyrus Macfarlane (who wrote a pamphlet about
the eclipse), found only flying scud when they went
to look at the young moon through a telescope from
the roof where the wireless is. Others in the party
were Mr. Petherick (a relative of The Bulletin’s
Esther and Betty Paterson) and his wife, Mrs. M.
Forrest and her child, and Mrs. Hertzberg. Jean
and Lute Drummond are at the Tivoli with
Allan Priora and Audrey Allen, and, though they
still lose their way in Brisbane, they say they
enjoyed the Brisbane flavor of their Christmas
pudding very well indeed.
The lawn at Ascot blossomed in summer frocking
for Boxing Day. Pretty Mrs. Frank Harper was
in primrose muslin, with a field of buttercups on
her head. Pastel-pink encased Mrs. Cecil Palmer,
who was topped by a magpie headpiece. A black-
and-gold hat and a white linen frock were sported
by Mrs. Norwood Brown, who has just sent off her
daughter Dyson to join her husband in India. White
was also worn by Mrs. Isaac Moore with a black
hat.
On Boxing Day, at Mackay, there passed out a
connection of poet Shelley’s family—one Woodward
Wyndham Jackson, who was born in India and
once pastoralised where now is Kingaroy township.
He was P.M. in various parts of Bananaland, and
for six years chairman of the Mackay Harbor Board.

A quart or two of lubricant will save the situation.
That’s the time you need Texaco Motor Oil.

Admiral Gilly and his officers met Billy
Hughes and a select company at Fed-
eral Parliament House the other day, and
put away a well-arranged luncheon to the
strains of a French marine band. Hughes
hadn’t raked up enough of the language for
an impromptu oration, so he read a speech of
welcome wlrch is suspected of having been
wrenched from the dictionary by Percy
Deane. But the Priminister’s discourse was
easy-going in comparison to the Admiral’s
laborious response in English. It was a
large document, and he was manifestly
winded by the uncommon idiom. But the
audience, frequently floored by the Gallic
pronunciation, pretended that all was well,
and the sailor, beaming his thanks through
his pince-nez, doubtless felt that he had
struck a blow for the entente cordiale. Gilly,
who wears a load of decorations, fills a
uniform well, and is quite unconcerned when
he is called “Ghilly,” though members of the
Alliance Francaise and others who have had
their French recently manicured are ready
to swoon over the indignity. Among the
cultured classes “zheel-yee” is the way to
address the gallant mariner.
There is always a forlorn hope that Aus-
tralia will some day evolve a Christmas festi-
val to suit the climate. The midday spread
of hot roast-beef, turkey, goose and blazing
plum-pudding is a fetich that is hard to
stamp out. The thermometer sizzles. Cook
has her temper frayed to shreds. The fami’y
suffers torments of . indigestion—and all
through the worship of a god of Convention.
Violent efforts have even been made to intx-o-
duce mock snow. Our English Governor-
folk started the idea with snow-balling. at
parties with mock snowballs, and Sassiety
followed slavishly. Mock snow was abso-
lutely The Thing this season in covering
the tables and the foodstuffs, and a . semi-
lunatic snowballing has been the fashion at
belated summer dances. The sight of hot
jazzers pelting other hot jazzers with balls
of fluff made imported folk who were not
“Government House” wonder at the topsy-
turviness of the world. Isn’t it up to Aus-
tralians to show English visitors some gleam
of a hot-country Christmas? Hosing with
real water would be a more seasonable and
altogether more rational diversion hei’e than
snowballing with sham snow.
Ellis Davies, chief engineer and partner
of Ruwolt’s machinei’y works at Richmond,
has promised his future to Betty, only
child of Mrs. and the late Dr. Roland Mac-
lean, of Point Lonsdale, Vic. The charming
Bettv is known to the Inky Way, as she
was ‘for a while on Punch, and more re-
cently sat behind a pen on Melbourne Sun.
Her intended is the son of the H. M. Davieses,
of Kalima, Gippsland Lakes. Before taking
a job with Charles Ruwolt he was for eight
years chief engineer on the Great Fingal
mine in W.A.
The novelty-hunting public who patron-
ise a certain eat-and-jazzery is liable
to get a shock one of these nights.
The latest scheme is a blinding flash of
light, during which a dancer disappears and
only her frock is left behind. Both men
and machines are always liable to err, and
there seems to be a hori’ible risk of Fate
presenting an amazed management with an
empty frock and a staggered audience with
a lady in her birthday suit.
Mrs. Margie Tobin, teacher of Mitta Mitta
North School, has resigned to go into busi-
ness. For years she ran the three most in-
accessible mountain schools in Victoria, week
about in each. Again and again she turned
down tempting offers of promotion from her
Department. Later, she settled down in one
of the schools, Mitta North, created a settle-
ment, established a public hall, library and
tennis court, engineered a bi'and-new school
building and raised over £2OO for further
social activities. A record crowd turned
up from every valley and mountainside
within coo-ee for her send-off the other day.
Anne Macky, the founder of the People’s
Conservatorium in Melbourne, whose object
is to spread a love of music among the
masses, and to create first-class listeners
rather than second-rate performers, has
returned home from Eui’ope, where many
famous people expressed intei-est in her bold
and democratic scheme. Lilian Bayliss,
director of the “old Vic.,” gave her helpful
advice; and among her patrons she includes
such literary celebrities as Walter de la Mare,
W. H. Davies, J. C. Squire, W. J. Turner
and Siegfried Sassoon.
There is weeping and wailing and likewise
gnashing of the very best gold-filled teeth
among two sets of our squattocracy. One
young sheep-rearer, filled to repletion with
the wine of the country, playfully hit a pal
over the head with a dead marine just as
Robbo of Little Lon’ might do. The
consequences were unpleasant, and now
there’s the devil to pay. The bottle-
brandishing squattocrat is. a rich bache-
lor, and his engagement is trembling m
the balance. People here are recalling a
similar incident of some months back in the
dining-room of a front-rank Sydney hotel.
In that case a squatter was also involved,
and he had also imbibed more than was
good for him, his friends or the reputation
of the house. Only, instead of using a bottle
he produced a revolver and blew a hole —no,
not in one of his pals, but in the floor. There
is talk of a school for the purpose of teaching
rich pastoralists to “carry their liquor like
gentlemen,” as the old English phrase goes;
but the general impression seems to be that
its prospects of doing much real good would
be small.
The medical Davenports have flitted to
Sorrento. Their seaside place dates from
the very early days before Government
beach-reserves. He has little leisure-time to
spend there himself, but the place is rarely
empty. During severe epidemics of s ckness,
when nurses are worked almost to break-
ing-point, the. situation has been saved for
many by the generosity of the Doc., who has
bundled them off in batches for the tonic
and rest of a few days by the sea.
The Riverina is leading the bucolic
field in the brilliant idea of doing farm
work at night by electric light. The
men will work in shifts, no doubt, but,
as likely as not, the innovation will fall
heavily on the women-folk. The three solid
meals a day and snacks in between will ex-
tend to a nightmare of feeding problems.
Curious how many farmers, who stop at no
expense in labor-saving machinery for
farm work, rarely consider its value in
the feminine department. The Women’s
Section of the Farmers’ Association is a
comparatively recent, but not-too-early, addi-
tion ; and the committee, made up of women
who have lived a country life and know
a thing or two, is putting up a big fight
to make farmers see the error of their
ways, and give their wives a chance. There
is one rich stretch of cattle country in Vic.
where the men are incredibly wealthy, and
take it as a matter of bourse that Mum and
“the girls” do all the women’s work. Ip
fact, one wife is insufferably uppish because
she can boast of her “girl”—her one and
only hired help. The pioneer type of
woman is still going strong, but she is
being worn out in her prime by work her
man could well afford to save her. A pro-
gramme of such a woman’s work-for-the
week would make a city flattite stare in
horror.
This is Miss Nellie Rowe, youngest
daughter of the late Dr. and Mrs. Casimir
Rove, of East Melbourne. Many years ago
she took her fine
contralto voice to
London, to be
rounded off by Ran-
daegger, but, after a
short singing career,
she settled down to
the more paying pro-
position of teaching.
Her school of music
in the Cromwell-road
is one of the most
active music centres
in all Kensington and
it is equipped with a
fine gold-and-white
ballroom and concert
chamber. She lately
lent it for a splen-
diferous ball-party
hostessed by Clara
Butt. The other day Miss Rowe handed
out a two-years’ scholarship for a prospec-
tive singing star, to, be chosen in Australia
by her particular pal, Melba. The Dame
selected Wilma Berkeley on the spot. The
little soprano has already reached her desti-
nation, where she struck her new voice-
trainer unpacking after having convoyed a
squad of pupils across the Channel on a
musical inspection of Paris.
J. G. Latham, K.C., who outed Robert
Best in Kooyong, got a generous measure of
support from a display of something that
might either have been chivalry or electioneer-
ing nous. While he was addressing an open-
air meeting his Labor opponent, Miss Jean
Daley, suddenly appeared, and Latham at
once stepped down and left the platform to
the lady. Of course Miss Daley told every-
body of her opponent’s sportsmanlike ges-
ture, and on tile second count Latham
secured 4769 of her votes to Best’s 572.
Latham, by the way, was a naval lieut.-
commander during the war—not that he
knew anything about lieut.-commanding, but
his job as naval representative to the
Hughes-Joe Cook tour to England in 1919
carried the rank and uniform. On the trip
back to Melbourne on the Friedrichsruh the
uniform threatened to cause Latham _ some
uneasiness. There were numerous ladies on
board (wives of Australians who had joined
the English Army), and Latham, in a
beautiful gold-braided uniform, w T as imme-
diately pestered with the usual female-
passenger questions on naut.cal matters.
Naturally he couldn’t answer one of them.
He put up with it for two days, and then
the uniform was stowed away in the cabin,
and Latham in “civvies” enjoyed a peaceful
trip home.
H&lene Taylor, pictured herewith, is a
young South Australian soprano, who is now
on the way to London with a London
Academy of Music
scholarship. Mrs. A.
E. V. Richardson, a
S, ut li Australian
who has adopted
Melbourne as her
home, brought the
girl over there to
let the natives hear
her. A special con-
cert was given that
was subscribed to by
Mrs. Albert Miller,
the Barrett knight,
Mrs. James Dyer, the
Hennessy, lady, Mrs.
T. G. White and her-
self ; and the con-
noisseurs said they
were much inter-
ested. She made her
final appearance in “The Messiah,” given in
the Adelaide Exhibition on November 18, by
the local Bach Society and the S. Aus.
Orchestra. There were 3000 people there,
and the young singer scored a fine success.
She sailed on November 29.
One saddens somewhat at the thought of
a drapery emporium’s Father Christmas
being carried off to gaol in his long white
beard and crimsop nightgown. -It happened
to the Santa Claus employed at the shop
which panto comedians allude to as Nuckl # y
and Bunn’s. The hired creature of fiction
had been detected in the act of pocketing
sixpences on his own account, and as he
was getting the respectable sum of £7 a
weejj for impersonating the legendary Santa,
a stern magistrate found it impossible to
hand him less than seven days.
Surviving her husband only a few months,
Mrs. George Graham passed out at Numur-
kah (Vic.) the other day. A home-loving
Scottish body, she availed herself to a very
limited extent of official functions when her
husband was Minister for Agriculture,
Water or Public Works in several Vic. Gov-
ernments. She must have made her home
a pleasant place, too, for it was difficult to
keep George Graham away from it at the
week-end. The long journey to. Wunghnu
(close to Numurkah) never worried him.
The Quinns and their children have put
their St. Kilda house into holiday linen
covers, and are off for a year’s wander
round the globe. The Niagara takes them
on the first stage of their trek.
The Julius Knight heel for men’s shoes
has comes into fashion in Paris. They don’t
call it the Julius Knight, but that is. a. mere
oversight. Our beautiful Julius originated
the fashion of high heels in Sydney many
years ago. The darling used to trip down
the steps of Menzies’ with two or three
slender inches of leather giving an arch to
his instep. What with his pale-grey waisted
suit, his blue tie, the turquoises gleaming
from three finger-r.ngs and a tie-pin, and the
ddbonair set of his pale-grey hat, Superbua
was a picture. And now Paris is doing like-
wise. Do not blame it on the war. Paris
has always been peculiarly susceptible to
horrible sartorial movements of this descrip-
tion. It is curious, by the way, that the
innovation should have come just as capri-
cious woman is favoring very flat heels for
herself —or even sandals with no heels at all.
Franklin, who arranged the amazing Bac-
chanalian scene in “Cairo,” is as tempera-
mental as a prima donna. He and the
despotic Asche frequently have violent quar-
rels ; then they fall on each other’s necks,
shake hands emotionally, and present each
other with tiepins. Franklin has acquired
in this way a varied assortment of pins—each
with its own tender history. Just before
“Cairo” caravanned to Melbourne, there was
talk about cutting out some of the more
luscious bits of the big revel. It was a
matter of Melbourne’s reputed wowserism.
Franklin immediately downed tools. The
revel dance was his creation; there was not
a turn of a girl’s wrist but he had arranged
and strenuously rehearsed it, and the
artist insisted that Melbourne would either
have to swallow the thing whole, or he
would return to London. Eventually the
rift was healed with tiepins as of yore.
Franklin, who was with Asche for three
years in London, has a genius for pose,
poise and color. He does not look like the
wonder he is, and that Asche knows him to
be. He is an Englishman with Oriental
eyes, large, pale cheeks, an Early Victorian
waist, and a penchant for rainbow ties and
socks. He has a valet (not a dresser,
please—that is what mere mummers have),
and he carries in his mountainous baggag
an electric chafing dish wherewith to P
pare his own special bits °f tucker. t-
were a she his clothes would fill columns ot
social gossip.
Our only bart, S’Rupert, has a new name
among his pals. With great unction they
now hail him as “Milk-o.” Melbourne f nends
visitin" Sidney were taken to the new Claik
movie palace at Randwick and over the door
of the inevitable milk-shake and sundae-shpp
connected therewith they espied thejegencl.
“Rupert Clark, licensed m.lk-vendor. it is
said that a cow (rampant) and a view ot
Prospect reservoir are shortly to be added
to his coat-of-arms.
The Ormuz on her last trip brought 10
boys, orphans of London policemen who were
killed in the war. The Melbourne Police
Department took full responsibility ior the
youngsters, who were sent to the care ot
chief-accountant Nicholls, of the Force. It
was arranged that the boys should be placed
on Victorian farms, and they were snapped
up before you could say “Jack Robinson.
Nicholls personally escorted' the lads to tlieir
destinations. The experiment has been so
successful that a further batch will be sent out.
Incidentally, it is not so very long ago that
there d-sappeared from the Melb. police ranks
the last of the London Fifty—specially
selected men from the London J. Hops to
give backbone to our young Force in the
early days. This was Pewtris, who figured
in some of the Kelly-gang episodes.
The Travellers’ Aid Society in Melbourne
trundles along without much puffing
from the Society women who love to get
into the limelight on charity stunts. But
someone should spare a supper-dance or an
amateur theatrical show to help the Aiders.
They do Trojan work under great difficul-
ties : they have sparse quarters in the Lat-
robe and Lonsdale streets end of the city,
and some of these quarters are residential
and far too limited for the demand on them.
They not only take in stranded travelling
adults, but find room for the children. It is
curious how many children stranded travel-
lers can possess. A strange characteristic
of the mother of a large family is her
anxiety to move on when troubles come. One
down-and-out in the country will blew her
last penny on railway tickets for herself and
her brood, and she will travel on, always
thinking Eldorado is a few dozen stations
ahead. The Travellers’ Aid Society gets
many such. The society is in direct tele-
phone touch with Spencer-street station,
and when worried railway officials call it
up at any old hour to report a muddled
cavalcade a Helper goes forth and returns
with a small army. Often the society is
landed with a family of eight or nine help-
less creatures who are vaguely “moving on”
hoping for extraordinary th’ngs. Kindly
people help with clothes and other dona-
tions. A small charge is made for board and
lodging if there is any money to meet the
charge; but as often as not there’s none.
Then, again, a worried mother will buy a
ticket and put 14-year-old Mary on a train
and send her to find “work” in the city. The
Helpers find dozens of these cases. They
salve the girl, at the behest of a worried
official, give her a home and help her find
work. Society really should rally and enter-
tain itself at" a supper-dance or so to help
these plucky Aid workers. It could recom-
pense itself by picking out an occasional
plum in the way of a good, healthy country-
bred Mary Ann.
A line or two from Adelaide: —
What a Christmas! Cold and wet and blustery
—the lowest December thermometer for 65 years and
the lowest barometer ever. Campers shivered under
their dripping tents, and picnickers packed them-
selves and their sodden food into the. trains again
and ate the remains in the humdrum dryness of their
homes. About the one fixture that came through
triumphantly was the Port races (and even they
were nearly postponed). Both their Exes, were there.
Clothes were mostly coats and skirts and snuggish
hats, when they weren’t raincoats and umbrellas ;
and the sodden lawns and saddling-paddock wrote
the obituary notice of many a dainty shoe.
There was a party for blinded soldiers during the
week, to which his Ex. went, and another for
children of members of the British Imperial Services
Club. Their club was opened by Mrs. Arthur Rymill,
whose work for the institution has won her a life
membership. The Frank Mouldens gave a Christmas
party, too —a special one for the Press, with toasts
and speeches galore.
Various things conspired to reduce the originally-
planned week’s run of “The Ugly Duckling’’ to one
night, and even for that there was no early-door
crowding; too much Christmas shifting probably.
Lady Bridges was there, and her small daughter
(the latter in Girl Guide uniform, as ’twas a G.-G.
evening) ; also the Frank Mouldens, Dr. Christine
Krakowsky and other Guide enthusiasts. The cast
was much the same as at the “Duckling’s” debut;
but with a depressingly thin house to play to, none
of it could rise to its original form.
Another damsel from this village to take her voice
to England for a final polish is Reka Grasby, aged
22, with a London College of Music degree already
to her credit and Melba’s verdict that her voice is
“beautiful.”

Summer Time
is Rexona Time
The Australian girl, in Summer, is a true delight,
for she protects her complexion against the ravages
of hot, enervating days with Rexona Soap. Summer
in Australia is delightful, nevertheless decidedly
trying. It is the time when Rexona Soap is invaluable,
particularly in checking all skin imperfections.
Rexona Soap preserves and improves the complexion,
for its cleansing qualities are made still more
effective by its Rexona medication, which offers a
gratifying means of achieving a clear and beautiful
complexion.
Girls! Beautify
Your Hair.
There is nothing that you can do to preserve the
hair more than to use the greatest care with the soap
which you use as a shampoo. Rexona Soap cleanses
the hair and scalp thoroughly, its copious, lasting
lather absorbs the dirt, and then rinses out easily and
completely. As it contains no uncombined alkali, it
does not injure the hair, as so many other soaps do,
nor make it brittle, and it does not destroy the scalp's
natural secretions; instead, after a shampoo with
Rexona Soap, the hair dries fluffy and silky, for a
Rexona Soap Shampoo puts it in the condition which
makes for continued health and beauty.

Thought is the soul of action
THAT is the spirit which stands behind the
Comox (Oxy-Acetylene) process in Australia
to-day.
We are not satisfied with the fact that the
supremacy of the Oxy-Acetylene Flame is firmly
established in almost every field of welding and
cutting.
The Comox Service Department is actively en-
gaged in making every operator familiar with every
possible subject .that needs to be handled and
handled right.
Therefore when we sell a Comox Welding or
Cutting Plant our duty does not end there. We
try to keep that plant in active operation for the
good of the community.
Behind every Comox Welding or Cutting Outfit
stands vigorous advertising to educate the factory
manager, engineer, motorist, farmer, and even
the householder to the value of Oxy-Acetylene
Welding and Cutting as a means to economy
in time and money, whenever metal articles or
machinery need to be repaired or manufactured.

DO THE JOB
PROPERLY
True to their reputation for rarely taking
a risk, the Randwick bookmakers demanded
even money about Braehead’s chance in the uarring-
ton Stakes. Sime of them insisted on a shade of
odds. Yet many of these tedious parasites had had
a skinner on the Viliiers Stakes; moreover, there
were 18 starters in the Carrington, and the four-
year-old son of Mountain King-loli had won a whole
two races in 12 months. The time is approaching
when the A.J.C. will have to wipe out at least 75
per cent, of these alleged odds-layers and install a
straight-out totalisator on the ground they cumber
with their obnoxious presence. J. J. Garvan’s
horse duly won, but it took him all his time to
struggle home ahead of Duke Isinglass, who was
going much the faster at the finish. The Tatter-
sail’s Club Cup went to Queensland through the
agency of Tom McCarthy (9 to 2), who led all the
way and ran the 12 furlongs in 2min. 33+sec.
Master Cagou, Radiant Light (a winner on the
first day) and the favorite Oranian, who wasn’t
ridden in Wood’s finest style, were nearest to him at
the finish. For the rest, a 25-to-l chance (Buckra)
and two 20-to-l shots (Spanish Dollar and Nahara-
dan) rolled home to gladden the great soul of
Mcßook.
* * • *
Connelly’s luck was conspicuous in the
summer sprints at Caulfield and Flemington. With
the Bernard —Rose of Bleu gelding Sunburst, the
dashing Eric won the Malvern Handicap on the
heath and the Standish on the principal course.
Sunburst started favorite each time, and ran the
Standish distance in lmin. 12see.—rattling good time
over the straight six with Bst. 121 b. up. Both races
were bad for Mcßook, but he got his losses
back in the Bagot, which was landed by his old
friend Sinbad the Sailor (12’s) from the solidly-
backed Switch. Sinbad is another of Bernard’s
progeny, the dam being Summerbelle.
* * * #
Three or four weeks ago W.A. punters
were taking 7 to 1 about D. E. Grant’s double,
Mistico and Scorpius, for the Railway Stakes
and Perth Cup. This although Mistico is
an 11-year-old stallion —he won the W.A.T.C.
Derby in 1914 —and the English horse had
never been tried over two miles. As gen-
erally happens in these cases the infatuated
persons who grabbed the absurd odds didn’t even
get a leg in, Mistico being beaten out of a place
in the Railway, which fell to the Hannan’s Handi-
cap winner, Sweet Doris (10 to 1), with Over
There and Green Sward, both outsiders, second and
third. Scorpius (evens) made a better show than
the old ’un, but failed by half a neck to defeat
P. A. Connolly’s locally-bred mare Jolly Cosy (second
favorite at I‘o’s), albeit he had settled her three
times at w.f.a. Produced again in the Grandstand
Plate, on the last day of the meeting, the mare made
a cakewalk of it, but the son of Polymelus, who
has probably had enough racing for the time being,
didn’t start. His connections have designs on the
Caulfield Cup. Lee Steere, the owner of Eurythmic.
thinks so highly of the animal that he offered
£lsoo—vainly as it happened—for a half share.

Port Adelaide is making both the S.A.J.C.
and the Adelaide R. C. sit up and take notice. In
the second day of its two-days’ Christmas meeting
it put £50,000 through the Totalisator, which is a
State record; and gave £2OOO for the Port Adelaide
Cup, which is another (though there are legends of a
bigger Adelaide Cup half-a-century back). Charles
Irwin had the favorite, Socrates, but, unlucky as
usual, ran second to Black Rogue, from Mannum on
the Murray, let in at 6st. 101 b.; dividends £3l ss.
and £1 2s. Another innovation in this race was
giving £5O for a fourth.

“Lexite”: There was a cynical aptness in
the naming of the defunct S'ydney racing pony
Damaged Goods, which, in its time, won many races.
It was the progeny of Merrie Oliver from Light of
Love’s Daughter.
V ictoria beat IS. S. Wales comfortably in
the first Sheffield Shield clash, although things looked
none too good for the home side when Mayne’s
men had been rattled out for 125 in their "first
venture, 35 runs short of the Cornstalks’ very
modest total, it was Macartney who worked havoc
with the latter half of the side, coming out with
the glittering analysis of 5 for 8. If only the wicket
had improved under the severe rolling it got, the
Ma Staters, with their fine array of batting, should
now have bern on velvet; but' the pitch was still
playing queerly, and it was soon apparent they were
on thorns. Their second innings lasted but three
hours, and realised only 142. Collins (29), Hendry
(22), and Gray (28) were the only literal “scorers,”
and each man’s eye was sicklied o’er with the pale
cast of anxiety as he scraped up infrequent runs.
Liddicut took 4 wickets for 39, Wallace 3 for 54 and
Freemantle 2 for 8. This left Victoria with 178
to win, and the wicket being good and true for the
first time in the match, the task proved well within
their powers. The captain soon went, but Woodfull
(80 not out), Ryder (36), Hartkopf (17) and Park
(30 not out) gradually blasted any hopes the visitors
might have entertained of pulling the game out of
the fire. The batsmen took no risks, and the cricket
was painfully slow, as is best evidenced by the fact
that Woodfull took hours to get his runs, which
included only two fours; a solid, bulldoggy display.
Gray bowled best, with 2 wickets for 58. He is cer-
tainly a discovery.
In the game between the second elevens in
Sydney N.S.W. won by 49 runs, scoring 275 and
280 to Victoria’s 216 and 290. Oddly enough, both
captains were incapacitated in the field, Ratcliffe
(N.S.W.), after he had hit up 55 in his first and
only knock, and the veteran Carroll (he is 39 and
was playing in representative cricket nearly 20
years ago) before he was able to handle the bat at
all. In his absence the Victorians made a brave
attempt to perform the severe task set them in the
fourth innings. Their best bat was Ponsford of
St. Kilda (37 and 72) and next to him came
Mathers, an ex-Sydney junior (37 and 59). For
N.S.W, 13. B. Forsberg made a sparkling 90, which
included two sixers (off successive balls from Grim-
mett) and 11 fours; and Austin Punch showed a
return to form by scoring 58, mostly with elegant
shots on the off-side. Their most successful bowler
was Wall, who took 5 for 101, although the wicket
was too glossy to suit him; and the diminutive
O'Connor gathered 5 for 125. Vic.’s destroyers were
Grimmett (7 for 186), Carlton (4 for 67), and
D. Gamble, a fast bowler (5 for 166).
* * * *
Victoria occupied the wickets all New
Year’s Day at Melbourne against South Australia,
the start of the match having been postponed from
a rainy Saturday, and put up 289 for the loss of
seven men. The score was not an imposing one in the
cins., but the batsmen held the upper hand through-
out and the visitors were lucky in getting a couple
of men run out. Hartkopf (98), Ransford (73)
and Ryder (64), were the rungetters. Whitty took
3 wickets for 58 and Morton 2 for 61. The innings
closed for 328, and the Richardsons gave S.A. a
good start —1 for 70.

“Lucius”: Arthur Liddicut, who took
a prominent part in Vic.’s win over N. S.
Wales, comes of cricketing stock. The family
sideboard is decorated with trophies won by
the head of the family on cricket-fields about
Stawell (Vic.). When Arthur was a lad at the
local school his ambition was to play some day in
first-class cricket. Mentioning this to his dad he
was told that his only chance was to get into a
public-school team where he could be properly
coached. He was further informed that there was
little chance of the family finances standing such a
strain. The youth settled the matter by winning
two scholarships, thereby having the choice of attend-
ing either the Geelong Grammar School or Geelong
College. He chose the former, became a member
of the school team, and made a century against
Douglas’s eleven. Now he is one of the State’s
mainstays in bowling and batting.

Maclaren’s men are playing lively cricket
in the Shaky Isles. Against Canterbury they rattled
up 454 for six wickets.
Chapman got 183 in 2J
hours, smacking two sixers
and 27 fours, and Wilkin-
son made 102, his best
knock of the tour. Can-
terbury fell for 181 and
295, this after R. Worker
and Blunt had put on 208
for the first wicket. Then,
C. 11. Gibson felled 8 for
57, and the Englishmen
won by eight wickets. In
the first Test the visitors
made light of the Maori-
land bowling. They hit
505 in 379 minutes, and
closed their innings with
eight wickets down. The
veteran skipper’s own con-
tribution was 200 not out
in 264 min great per-
formance for a man of 50.
M.L. replied with 222 and
127, being beaten bv an
innings and 156 runs.
Freeman and Gibson
wrought the damage.

•‘Xalpha”: The Melbourne llni. cricket
team had a crowded fortnight in December. On the
9th it started a pennant match against Carlton. This
was curtailed at 4 o’clock, and the lads bolted by
the evening’s express for Adelaide. There they mopped
up the local ’Varsity with promptitude and despatch,
and they returned to Melbourne in time to crawl all
over Carlton, and catch Saturday’s express for Sydney.
On the Monday they started a game with the Sydney
Uni., and by Wednesday they had completed the record
of having played and won three matches in three capi-
tals within 12 days. And on the Saturday follow-
ing their champion, Freemantle, who did great things
in the Sydney match —he bagged 10 wickets for 122
and made 113 runs —took his place on the Melbourne
Cricket Ground in the Vic. XI against N. S. Wales.
* * * *
The scorching weather that struck Sydney
at the end of the old year made the cricket rather
languid, but one or two of the finishes were interest-
ing. Randwick failed by 8 runs to reach Glebe’s
353. B. Smith, a junior with a punch, helped him-
self to 108. Left-hander R. V. Wenholz (159) got
the major portion of Petersham’s 290 against Mos-
man’s 327, and R. Andrews contributed 105 of Bal-
main’s 233 v. Marriekville (368), for whom Alan
Thacker wrecked 7 for 59. Gordon (326) had the
only outright win of the round, over Sydney, who
fell for 196 and 110. A. J. McGreal (63) and W.
Williamson (52) alone shaped well against Kelleway
(8 for 99), Laxvrie (5 for 46) and Dive (7 for 140).
Paddington failed by 29 runs to reach St. George’s
179, the tall right-hander E. W. Adams, getting 6
lor 61. M. A. Noble topped the score with 33.
University crashed for 120 v. Waverley, 11.
Comber- a right-hander, better know'll in baseball
mowing down 5 for 19, but in the follow-on the
Uni. batsmen knocked up 181 for 5 w'ickets. The
other matches were won by North Sydney and Western
Suburbs. With half the season completed Gordon
and Waverley are leading with 20 points each from
Mosman and North Sydney (19 each), Balmain and
Marriekville (16 each), Central Cumberland (15)
• ! n 1 1 Petersham (14). These will comprise the A
division, and the remaining eight clubs will figure
among the B’s.
* * * *
“Winkle”: C. H. MacKenzie, the 19-year-
cld captain of Sydney Grammar, is unquestionably
the best schoolboy batsman in Australia to-day.
Against the Melbourne boys, in the triangular con-
tests by Yarra’s. banks, he * made 124 in the first
innings and 149 in the second. Next season he will
play with Balmain. The youth has been coached
by Alex. Bannerman, C. B. Turner and Jimmy
Searle.
* * * *
“Tren”: Huge scores are a hobby with
CV «TY, W t ales , cricketers. All the record totals in
Sheffield Shield matches have been made by that
State', as well as the highest score against Tasmania,
i laying against S. Australia in 1901, the Cornstalks
established two records that still stand: Their score
(918) was not only the highest ever reached in a
first-class match, but contained the greatest number
of individual centuries —five. Syd Gregory collected
168, Noble 153, Poidevin 140, R. A. Duff 119, and
Ivedale 118. Other massive totals compiled by the
Mother State were 839 against Tasmania in 1909;
815 against Vic. in 1909 ; 807 against S.A. in 1899 •
805 against Vic. in 1905; 775 against Vic. in 1882 ;
a.nd, last month, 786 against S. Aus. On that occa-
sion four individual centuries were scored; a feat
paralleled in 1919 by the same State against the
same victims, when Bogle made 200, Kelleway 121
not out, Bardsley 106, and Andrews 103.
* * * *
“First Slip”: “Azrim” (B. 14/12/’22)
has signally failed to dispose of “Winkle’s” claim
that Dr. A. E. V. Hartkopf is the greatest all-rounder
produced by Vic. public schools. Frank Boynton,
of Wesley, was never in the same street as Hartkopf,
and as for S. B. Gravenall, Jack Newham and Jimmy
1 rout, they were not in the same suburb. Boynton’s
chief title to athletic fame was as an oarsman,
and there it ended. He was not even, a regular mem-
ber of the Melb. ’Varsity XVill, whereas Hartkopf
was not only one of the stars of the League foot-
ball team, which included such champions as Leo
Seward, Martin Ratz and the Cordner brothers, but he
was commonly regarded as the greatest half-forward
of the year. His cricket fame is too well known to
warrant mention, as he stands to-day, on the retire-
ment of Armstrong, the greatest all-rounder in the
State. In cricket, football and running he may be
described as having achieved the highest State honors,
an achievement to which neither Boynton nor Graven-
all, Newham nor Prout could plead guilty. “Azrim’s”
argument that Boynton was a good billiardist (he was
certainly no Lindrum) reminds me of an applicant for
a job as sportsmaster, who urged that he had been
“the best cover-point in Spain,” and even now was
a fearless ping-pong player, and an authority on egg-
laying competitions.
* * * #
“Past Grammar”: Aitken and Wallace,
the M.L. and N. S. Wales Rugger three-quarters, who
are both Rhodes Scholars at Oxford, played in the
first of the Scottish International Trials. Both were
included in the Scotland side versus The Rest, and
both have been invited to play with the same side in
the final trial, which makes it practically certain that
they will wear the thistle. Their qualification for
Scotland is the elastic “racial” one. Forsayth, of
Parramatta King’s, Scotland and Oxford (he was the
Uni.’s full-back for some seasons), is an instance of
the elasticity referred to. More than one Aussie
has similarly qualified, notably G. V. Portus (N.S.W.)
and A. B. Timms (Vic.), who came back to Australia
with Mullineaux’s team in ’99.
* * * *
“Push Off”: Unless the timekeepers are
all dreaming, Andrew Charlton, of Manly (N.S.W.),
is the slickest 15-year-old swimmer Australia has
seen. In a specially-arranged club handicap he was
clocked to have left 440yds. behind in smin.
16 3-ssec. Compare the best times of Australian
cracks during the past 30 years: F. C. V. Lane,
smin. 50sec. ; R. T. Cavill, 5 min. 26 l-ssee. ; B. B.
Kieran, omin. 19sec.; C. Healy, smin. 28sec. ; F.
Beaurepaire, smin. 17 4-ssec. ; H. H. Hardwick,
smin. 33sec., and W. Longworth, smin. 26 3-ssec.
Norman Ross, the American, is credited with world’s
record time, Omin. 14jsec., but he never put up
anything like the Manly boy’s figures when in Aus-
tralia. Charlton will be tried out by W. W. Harris
in the N.S.W. championships on Jan. 13, 17 and 20.
If he can reproduce his recent times he should easily
account for the Hawaiian.

Queensland boats were prominent in the
races for 16ft. skiffs held on Sydney harbor during
the holidays. - From the North came Curious, the
State champion, Furious, her sister ship (both were
built by Norman Wright, who piloted Curious),
Agnes, Avro, Pastime, Memory and M.C. They
proved snodgers off the wind, but couldn’t pace it
with the N.S.W. craft with sheets inboard; and
unfortunately the weather was mostly against them.
Furore (N.S.W.), well handled bv Dick Fennell,
regained the inter-State title, won by Agnes, the
Bananalander rep., in 1920, Curious and Furious
finishing next at intervals of 31sec. and lOsec.
respectively. However, the Rawson Cup handicap
went to Curious, which lobbed home from the honor-
mark lfmin. ahead of Reo (N.S.W.), with Vision
and St. George next. The contest for the Dumaresq
Cup (it had to be re-sailed owing to disaster over-
taking the fleet) was won by St. George (ljmin.),
admirably handled by W. Hayward. Curious
(scratch), again piloted by her builder, and cleverly
at that; lifted second money by landing across the
line 14sec. later, and Awanui (Strain.) was third.
Austral (lQJmin.) was the only other boat to finish
out of 24 starters.
BERT MCCARTHY, featherweight cham-
pion for a few weeks. He has since
been beaten by Spargo, Semmens and
Ramies.
“Gulmarrad”: When the late Mick Rush
was at the height of his fame as a sculler, he kept
a store at Rocky Mouth, now called Maclean. He
was the idol of the local Irish, and the morning
after his defeat by Elias C. Laycock 1 remember
going to school with Paddy Finnessey, who afterwards
became a sculler of some note. Paddy, seeing an
ardent supporter of Mick standing on his verandah,
whispered to me: “Watch me have a bit of fun
with old Jack.” As we passed he said, “Laycock
won, and a good job, too.” In an instant he was
seized by the scruff of the neck and conducted down
to the creek. “Will Laycock buy y’r father’s corn?”
yelled Jack. It was a thoroughly soused Paddy
that scrambled out.
* * * #
One of the inflictions known as six-day
wheel-races was perpetrated in Sydney during the
’am-and-pudden season. It was won by Les Ham-
mond, the Australian champion, and Ken Ross, just
back from the other side of the world, who beat
the next pair, H. Horder and R. Munro, out of
sight. Bob Spears, the Dubbo (N.S.W.) plugger,
who has as good a right as the next man to the
title of world’s champion, brightened the proceed-
ings at intervals by giving exhibitions of his ability
to get up high speed at short. notice. He is cer-
tainly a great pedaller, and along with Jackie Clark
(the next-best to the once-invincible Kramer) and
others has kept Australia before the U.S. public
as a producer of cycling cracks.
* * * *
“15-30” : Tilden, the world’s tennis cham-
pion, who has accused other players of a tendency
to “blow up” on strong provocation, exploded him-
self in a match with the imperturbable Johnston
at New York a few weeks ago. Johnston won the
first set, Tilden the second, and the third went to
the Californian on a seemingly bad decision by the
umpire, though it is likely that, without the call
of the official, Johnston would have captured the
third session. But the extraordinary feature of the
case was that the umpire called “fault” on Tilden’s
second service ball, after it had been slammed back-
wards and forwards in a rally. Both players were
astounded, and Johnston very fairly offered to call
the point a “let” and give Tilden another go, but
the latter banged his racquet on the ground and
bounded into the pavillion. The subsequent proceed-
ings, though spoiling Tilden’s fair record, are no
surprise to anyone who has studied him closely
He threw away the fourth set to Johnston on his
alleged objection to the umpire’s decision, though
I’m inclined to think that exasperation—traces of
which Patterson noticed during the great win by
the Australians in the Davis Cup doubles —got the
better of him and made him a baby for the time
being. Talking of Tilden, after seeing him in Mel-
bourne about two years ago, I wrote that the peevish
way he hit the ground with his racquet when he
failed with a shot suggested “that he was intended
for the other sex and the operatic profession.” I
also mentioned “his lowered will-to-win when faced
with dogged opposition,” and I have no doubt that
in his match with Johnston he, vulgarly speaking,
“dropped his bundle.” Bad umpiring is certainly
very disturbing, but no good player should ever
make that the excuse for disparaging the other
fellow’s victory by chucking him the match.

So sick is the state of professional box-
ing in Sydney, owing to the iniquitous tariff demanded
for indifferent fare, that there wasn’t much of a
crowd at the Collins-Dwyer argument, although it
was alleged to be “the fistic event of the year.” And
it wasn’t much of a contest, either. Dwyer got the
decision, and didn’t deserve it. His was certainly
the cleaner work, but the fact that Collins chased
him from beginning to end, and that he hung on at
every opportunity, wiped out any lead he may have
gained by his harmless taps. But for Collins’s
aggressiveness there wouldn’t have been anything of
a fight, and the Newcastle youth was entitled to a
draw, at least. The lads met at catch weights, so
Dwyer’s lightweight title was not at stake. In the
other holiday contests —both stopgap affairs —Mendies
whipped King in 14 rounds, and Heeney made Complin
turn it up at the end of the ninth, the M.L. heavy-
weight is a superbly-built athlete, but he seemed
shoulder bound, and lacked a finishing punch. Comp-
lin appeared to lack about everything a citizen needs
to succeed at the game of hit-and-stop. Pound-ten-
five-and-three-plus-tax was the tariff at each of these
tedious exhibitions. The money was worth it.

Fred Sugar, an Adelaide welterweight, who
has won a heap of local fights, did well to gain a
points decision over the inexhaustible Stone. Harry
is not as young or as agile as he was, and confined
his attention to in-fighting, at which he scored most
of his points. But Segar generally kept him away
with a straight left. Micko Walsh and other veterans
think highly of Segar, and a man who can beat
Stone ought to be in line for a fight with Bradley.
A BAD BEGINNING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There were so many proper ways
Of starting ’25:
A New Year dream of prayer and praise
Seemed beautiful to me.
I’ve felt a longing, all my days
A holy man to be.
Awhile, on gentle pastime bent,
I planned a picnic jaunt,
To find enjoyment and content
In that sequestered haunt
Where summer holidays are spent
By uncle Job, and aunt.
Anon, I almost had in view
A happy New Year start—
The sort that’s made by not a few
Who have their home at heart,
And, when a grass-cut’s overdue,
Play well the mower’s part.
I thought last week of working hard
On Monday, Jan. the First —
A day of steady toil, unmarred
By quenching of my thirst.
And then (how like a spineless baid!)
My brave resolves dispersed.
No victory o’er self I won;
I toiled not, nor did spin ;
The New Year was by me begun
In foolishness and sin.
I sought the pleasure wise men shun
Amidst a racecourse din—
In short, I went to Flemington
And did my money in.
VICTORIA.

To Avoid Sickness.
To avoid and to overcome sickness of all
kinds, watch your bowels. Don’t allow old
fermenting food to stay in them for days,
but get it out.
If your stomach is disordered, or your
bowels constipated, if you feel sluggish,
dizzy or bilious, get a box of Chamberlain’s
Tablets at once.
They act directly upon the liver, regulate
the bowels, invigorate the stomach, cleanse
the system. The result is a relish for food,
increased strength and a clear head.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are good for con-
stipation, sour stomach and gases on the
stomach. A single dose often relieves these
troubles.
The use of these Tablets is not followed by
constipation as is the case with many laxatives.
Instead of weakening the bowels they strength-
en them to act naturally without assistance.
Chronic constipation may be permanently
relieved by Chamberlain’s Tablets. They
have none of the sickening qualities of pills,
and do not produce an unpleasant effect.
Keep Your Bowels Clean.
That listless, tired, drowsy feeling may be
due to poisonous matter lodged in the bowels.
Many folks who always feel tired and only
“half alive” will be surprised how much
better they will feel when they get rid of this
matter which has been poisoning their system
for days.
Nervousness, sleeplessness and some kinds
of headaches are frequently signs of poison-
ing of the system through poisons left in the
bowels.
Irritation of the bladder, breathlessness,
so-called weak and fluttering heart, are often
caused by pressure of gas in the intestines—
this gas may originate from decaying food in
the system.
A man is seldom sick when his bowels are
regular, and never well when they are
irregular. Bear this in mind and take
Chamberlain's Tablets as occasion may
require. There is nothing better. They
are mild and gentle in their action and
pleasant to take.
Old Age.
Old age as it comes in the orderly process
of nature is a beautiful and majestic thing.
It stands for experience, knowledge, wisdom,
counsel. That is old age as it should be,
but old age as it often is means poor digestion,
torpid bowels, a sluggish liver and a general
feeling of ill health, despondency and misery.
This in almost every instance is wholly
unnecessary. One of Chamberlain’s Tablets
taken immediately after supper will improve
the digestion, tone up the liver and regulate
the bowels. That feeling of despondency
will give way to one of hope and good cheer.

OLD folks should never use physics
that are harsh and irritating.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are gentle
and soothing in their action, never
produce a disagreeable effect and are
beneficial to the whole system. They
are an ideal preparation for aged people.

Chamberlains
Tablets
Children’s Ailments.
Children, like adults, are subject to
disorders of the stomach, liver and Dowels,
and many of the apparently alarming ailments
of childhood are due to these causes.
Constipation is a common trouble among
children and is often the cause of seeming
stupidity at lessons and also of many an
exhibition of temper.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are invaluable for
children. They are pleasant and safe to take
and absolutely without harsh effect.
Half a Tablet is sufficient for children from
six to twelve; for children under six, one-third
of a Tablet will have the desired effect.
If your child is bilious, if its appetite is
poor and variable, if it is fretful and
nattering, restless in its sleep, you may be
sure that its stomach is out of order and a
few doses of Chamberlain’s Tablets will
quickly set it right.

The Difference between Bearings
that Rub and Bearings that Roll
is comparative to Dragging and
Wheeling a Load
The load you cannot drag moves easily when mounted on wheels. Similarly, a line
shaft that drags on plain bearings turns freely when supported on SKF self-aligning
ball-bearing hangers.
Plain line shaft bearings, even when properly lubricated, are subject to the wearing
action of metal rubbing on metal. When lubrication is insufficient, or is prevented by
the intrusion of dust or dirt, or when binding strains are set up through improperly-
aligned shafting, the bearings drag like a load on the ground.
When self-aligning, ball-bearing hangers are used the shaft rides almost frictionless —not only
when well aligned, but also under conditions of misalignment. The inner race tilts with the
shaft like a ball-and-socket joint, and the bearing cannot bind.
SKF Plummer Blocks and Hangers pay for themselves many times over by saving approxi-
mately 60 per cent, of the power wasted in overcoming the frictional drag in plain bearings
and by reducing lubricant and maintenance costs 80 per cent.

THE INKY WAY.
“E.S.”: Most of Sydney’s bookshops are emblaz-
oned with the slogan, “Buy books,’’ and in the majo-
rity of such shops you find nothing but imported
books. Buying them enriches the importer, but
is of precious little benefit to Australia. I suggest
that book-buyers who are interested in the advance-
ment of Australia and its literature should patron-
ise only those shops that do some good for our
country by stocking or making a special feature of
local productions.
Vic. Government has given £20,000 at auction
for the Russell-street portion of the Herald office
not included in the freehold sold to the Cockv party
for its daily. The building, which Pinschoff and
others used to occupy in pre-war days, will be used
by the State for a central immigration office in
place of the present rented building in Flinders-
strect West. The £90,000 realised from both build-
ings should go a long way towards paying for the
new Herald building now approaching completion
at the corner of Exhibition and Flinders streets.
“Jacky Roo” (London): London publishers are
having a busy time this autumn. The daily output
has been averaging 55 volumes, and on one occa-
sion as many as 75 books were issued. Novels
are in great demand, and prices well standardised
at 7s. od. Books of travel and biographical works,
especially those dealiig with the Victorian era, are
popular; but poetry is selling badly, except for a
new volume by A. E. Housman. Housman, “the
young man’s poet,’’ was the author of those popular
verses, “The Shropshire Lad.” His latest collection,
“Last Poems,’’ is the first thing he has published
since 1890.
“E.”: Why is Melbourne Public Library not more
up-to-date in its newspaper department? I wanted
to look up the American papers on a matter of
importance, and was surprised to learn that the only
American paper taken in was the New York Times,
and even that was not always on tap. In the New
York Library there is a good selection of Australian
papers, including The Bulletin, always readily
available. Besides the representative American news-
papers Melbourne might also put in a few French
and continental papers. The excuse is that there is
no money. But the cost would be trifling, and the
benefit to journalists (who are now compelled to
take desperate chances on foreign affairs, for the
cables are of no help), and therefore to the general
public, would be considerable.
“Nimshi”: “Wilfrido” (B. 7/12,/’22) entirely mis-
represents me when he says that I attributed “heavi-
ness and obscurity” to Conrad. I did not. I
charged him with tortuousness of narrative, super-
fluous analysis, sentimentality, an unsatisfactory type
of hero and a lack of humor. As to obscurity,
I find Conrad as easy as a child’s primer
compared with Meredith or Henry James. “Wil-
frido” appears to be obsessed with the idea that he
and a few other devoted adherents of Conrad, repre-
senting an intellectual minority, are engaged in
defending their champion from a rabble, represent-
ing prejudice and lack of vision. Yet all the heavy
artillery is used on his side, and my protest in the
first place was due to an irritation at this incessant
and monotonous booming. Meanwhile it is worth
noting that it is “Wilfrido,” not I, who ascribes
heaviness and obscurity to Conrad, in the intervals
of gushing over his idol.
“Wilfrido”: “The New Zealanders in Sinai and
Palestine,” by Lieut.-Colonel C. G. Powles, C.M.G.,
D. 5.0., forms a companion volume to “Australia in
Palestine.” Although it is not such an artistic pro-
duction as the other, it is more comprehensive. There
are introductions by Generals Maxwell and Murray,
Field-Marshal Allenby and Lieut.-General Chauvel.
The book gives full praise to the work of the
Australian Brigades, especially during the great
coup that ended, after a series of bloodless victories,
in the capture of Damascus, and an enthralling narra-
tive is garnished with informative comment on the
many places of historical and biblical interest at
which the Division was stationed or through which it
passed. The most popular spot appears to have been
Richon-le-Zion, a garden city which is the centre of
the Palestine wine industry, and contains the most
capacious wine-cellar in the world, 104 vats, each
holding 60,000 pints.
“L.E.”: On the Red Page (December 14) Hector
Dinning writes that although the English tradition
is ours “we may so modify its form as to provide
a highly characteristic Australian literature.” In
this case he seems to favor the idea that the litera-
ture of this country should be “distinctively Aus-
tralian.” He quotes authorities. He stands forth as a
champion of nationalism. But in the London Mer-
cury, addressing an English audience, he seems to
say the exact opposite. Asking himself what is
the reason Australian literature is so inferior to
English he replies: “I believe the answer is that
though in theory we have the heritage of English
letters here, in practice we do not adopt it.” In
the Red Page he wants Australians to be “dis-
tinctively Australian” ; but in the Mercury he chides
them for being already too Australian. These con-
traries cannot be reconciled. Dinning wants Aus-
tralia literature to hold by English tradition, and
also to break away from the tradition. If it is
too traditional, it will lack distinction; but if it
breaks away and becomes “distinctively Australian”
on that very account it will be inferior to contem-
porary English literature. The only conclusion I
can draw from these statements is that Australian
literature is in a hopeless position, somewhere be-
tween the devil of originality and the deep sea of
tradition.
“F.T.8.” on the sensation of being Bellerived: —
How many a promising young plant has wilted
and withered in a spray of ink from The
Bulletin Answers to Correspondents column will
never, I suppose, be known until Judgment Day
—if then. Take my own case. Years ago I sent in
a pungently satirical (in my own confident opinion)
set of verses. Then I laid my ears back and im-
patiently waited for the next week’s Bulletin.
After a seeming lapse of years it arrived, and
with what avidity I opened its pages! Eagerly
I scanned the Various Verse column. Not there.
Then I searched in all the likely spots—the Abo.
and Society pages—and then less likely corners,
Poverty Point, Business Robbery, etc., with the
same fruitless result. Last of all, with a sinking
heart, I turned to the Answers to Correspondents,
and (oh, my god-father!) this is what I saw:—
“F.T.8.: Some poets have only one poem. You
are a poet with only one verse:
“England sends to keep us loyal—
And it’s our fault that we let her —
Duff and other Agents-Royal
(Duff to eat would suit us better).”
This tragedy happened long before the Bellerive era,
but still I had the sensation that I had been belle-
rived. It was with a feeling of intense satisfacton
I read the other day that even Henry Lawson had
been bellerived in his youth. Doubtless it did him
good. But it choked down my native woodnotes for
all time.
“J.H." (London): By the time Lord Northcliffe
died the Times had become an expensive toy. How-
ever, Lord Rothermere wasn’t going to let it pass
out of the family without a struggle. And so the
last of the Walters had to engage in a desperate fight
to circumvent Rothermere’s attempts to get round the
clause in the original Walter-Northcliffe agreement
which gave Walter an option to re-aequire the shares
on Northcliffe’s death. Walter lacked the necessary
money, and, for a long time, it seemed to Fleet-
street that Rothermere, who had the cash,
would win. Then one day someone had an
inspiration. The Astor millions were mobi-
lised, and even Rothermere found it im-
possible to bid against Astor. The end came with
the announcement, in the Times of Oct. 25, that
the Northcliffe and Ellerman shares had been acquired
by Walter in conjunction with Astor, and that hence-
forth the Times would be “under new management.”
The price of victory is understood to have been
£1,500,000! An inevitable corollary was the resig-
nation of Wickham Steed (editor) and Sir Campbell
Stuart (general manager). Both were Northcliffe
nominees, too tarred with the Northcliffe brush to
fit in with the new regime. The insurance stunt,
and, possibly, the picture page, are also booked for
oblivion.

Standing behind a new verandah with
electric globes emphasising its length in the
dark, the Princess’s Theatre, in Spring-street,
Melbourne, has forgotten its more or less
dingy past and started out on a fresh career
as the handsomest playhouse in Australia.
New shops have been built into the frontage
without damaging Hugh Ward’s cherished
plan of an imposing promenade, whilst the
bewildered patrons of the “gods” now enter
through bevelled glass doors in Spring-street
and have tip-up chairs instead of the old
wooden benches. In the auditorium the
deep curve of the old circle has been abol-
ished, and another enclosure on the canti-
lever principle gives a closer view of the
stage. The seats, with movable backs, are
roomy enough for the largest dowager, and
are all upholstered in the Itose du Barry
pink, which is the prevailing tint of the
magnificent curtain and blushes m the
candle-brackets fastened to the boxes and
walls. The boxes are prettily decorated
lean-overs without the suffocating roofs and
curtains of the old-fashioned pens, and each
one is entered by glass-panelled doors offer-
ing its users an unexampled entree in full
sight of the house. The cream fretwork of
the proscenium arch is detailed by the elec-
tric light behind, but it will require a lot of
feather-dustering, as will the cream appoint-
ments elsewhere. The only criticism that
can be legitimately levelled against the
theatre is that the d.c. vestibule is rather
over-dressed in gold-leaf, whilst the painted
ladies, lounging along the incurve joining the
walls to the ceiling, are not the goddesses
one has a right to expect.
** * *
Hugh Ward’s opening venture at Mel-
bourne Princess’s is a musical comedy
where human interest is mostly centred in
the limbs and lissomness of a delightful
dancing chorus. Comparisons being less
odious than instructive, “The O’Brien
Girl,” may be described as natural
sister to “Mary,” late of the Royal.
You get the same paucity of. purely Ameri-
can plot, and prevalence of picturesque in-
truders with lively legs. The marked differ-
ence between Hugh Ward’s show and its
blood relation is that the name-character m
this case has a sentimental value, which time
should increase, and most of the charming
chorus work, for which Minnie Hooper must
be largely responsible, earns the respect
due to unfamiliarity, especially at the outset.
As regards the dancing, too, praise for the
chorus is praise for the principals. The
steps that follow an uneventful ditty, almost

as surely as day comes after night, have the
grace of novelty in them, and a strange aid
to new effects is provided in the first act by
a large, fontlike basin, in the centre of the
stage, to which solo and duet dancers resort
when they have exhausted ordinary devices.
In its vast assortment of dresses, its color-,
background and movement, “The O’Brien
Girl” makes a fresh appeal to the Melbourne
public. Much of its style and elegance are
unconventional from an Australian point of
view. For the rest, the new people, or some
of them, will grow upon acquaintance, and
the fragile little narrative will appear
stronger when played more closely than on
Boxing night.

Handicapped bv recent sickness, Mamie
Watson did very well in the name-part. She
is a pretty girl, tall and willowy, with a
musical voice, and though she has hardly
the million-dollar smile which the plot de-
mands of her, the lady looks sweet and falls
in love very winsomely. Like another Diana
of Dobson’s, she breaks the monotony of a
humble commercial career by dissipating a
considerable lump sum on a brief holiday at
an American haunt of fashion, where she
meets her employers, and the unsuspecting,
awful wife of one of them, and the adoring
son of the other partner. The fact tnat a
marriage had been arranged between the
adoring son and the nimble daughter of the
partner with the terrible spouse, and that
the nimble daughter is pursued by a genial
idiot whose other name ought to be Gertie,
provides a gentle complication. Miss Wat-,
son’s stage chaperon, Ena Dale, makes a
favorable first impression with her sympa-
thetic little singing voice and unatlected
manner; also the nimble one, June Roberts,
of the smaller voice, improves as one gets
used to her and ceases to wonder whether
she is herself or another little stranger
from America who resembles her closely.
Some of June’s dancing is a del ght. lhe
soulful hero is short and fairly satisfactory,
outside of his top note, wh Ist the Berthed
gentleman, who plays the festive busybody,
is doubtless an
acquired taste.

piest touch in the _ _
entertainment. The music at its best is remi-
niscent yet ear-biting, and the conducting, by
Willy Redstone, of a liberal orchestra shows
delicate consideration for the voices of the
principals. Every word spoken on the stage
is audible. Excellent enunciation waits on
the theatre’s capital acoustics.
The sombre story of “Cairo, r: at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s, continues to live, move and
have its being spasmodically ’midst an
Aschean immensity of entertainment for the
eye. Some of the pauses between jerks of
narrative are favorable to pensive thought,
and the slow ballad sung by Miss Hilliard in
the harem of Prince Nur-al-Din (most pain-
fully theatrical of pretenders) is rightly re-
ferred to by her ladies-in-waiting as a “sad
and sorry song.” The wonder is that it
never depresses the small colored slavelet
who squats beside the warbler and plays a
fictitious accompaniment on a stringless lute.
But the irrepressible accompanist persists
in twanging non-existent strings with flying
fingers, as though the doleful ditty were a
hurricane set to music.
At Melbourne King’s there was a lively
demand for “The Forty Thieves” during last
holiday week. That Morgiana took hardly
any trouble to annihilate the robber band
with boiling oil was seemingly of no import
to a cynical world. Apparently the ancient
romance of Abdallah and his push is not
expected to be taken seriously nowadays,
otherwise the Taits would not have sent a.
modern steamship (which, perhaps, was
wrongly described as a battleship in a pre-
vious notice) to scour painted seas in search
of the Bagdad looter. Anyhow, the panto,
is doing well up to now, and the scenic
efforts of Coleman and George Upward have
not been wasted on any vacancies in the
auditorium. Pantomime continues to cre-
ate a Christmas want.

At Melbourne Royal the newcomers in the
cast are giving a fillip to its revived popu-
larity. Baldesarre is a more melodramatic
brigand than Freeman of old, but in a luridly
melodramatic character Freeman was really
out of the picture where his successor looks
at home. Also, the new-chum comedian in
Phil Smith’s old part is now discovered by
careful scrutineers to be likeable for his dis-
tant attitude towards buffoonery.
The Fuller panto., at Melbourne Palace,
gives every promise of flourishing far into
next year. In “Dick Whittington,” where a
large tract of time is covered by Trained
Seals and a Mermaid in a Tank, the infant
mind finds much to keep it busy, and the
grown-up sees cause to come again. A speci-
ally alluring cause is Verna Bain, a shapely
young dancer who puts personality and in-
fectious enthusiasm into her activities. There
have been solo dancers more finished than
this beauteous Australian girl, but none with
more charm. Also Trixie Ireland, the second
“boy,” runs Dick Whittington (Dorothy
Lena) close in the matter of decorative
attraction, and these, with a fairy queen who
gives, as it were, a panto, trade-mark to the
annual outfit, help atone for the comparative
meagreness of the principal girls in skirts,
and a Dame whose hard masculine sex is
more evident than his humor. Concerning
Harry Thurston, who plays Alderman Fitz-
warren, this paper omitted to pass an
opinion last week. It might have admitted
that Thurston lacks breadth of style and is
deficient in drollery. This complaint applies
in a measure to the striking pair of con-
trasts billed as Tom Long and Tubby Tubbs
(who appeared at the Tivoli not long ago),
but the height of the tall one makes his little
bit of humor go a long way. When a moder-
ate comedian measure 7ft. in his socks he
amounts to a joke himself.
* * * *
Next week the impression made at Mel-
bourne Tivoli by G. P. Huntley and co. in
“Wallpapers” will be recorded in the light
of ample experience. The comedian who
“knocked” Australia in musical comedy 18
years ago didn’t hang “Wallpapers” in his
present abode until Saturday last.
“Blood and Sand” is at Hoyt’s, Melbourne
—it seems to be in most places since Billy
Hughes gave it its gi-eat advt. —and Hoot
Gibson is doing some hard shooting in
“Trimmed.” Mary Miles Minter is at the
Lyceum in “Moonlight and Honeysuckle.”
The Majestic has “Skin Deep”; and
at the same stand a musical genius
with polygamous instincts worries two
fond women in “The Concert.” After under-
going the pangs of false imprisonment m
“Perjury,” at the Melba, William Farnum
comes out on top ; and a backwoods drama,
“The Man from Lost River.” is getting a
vote of confidence at the Britannia.

“Cinderella” is, perhaps, of all the old
fairy tales the one that lends itself most
readily and eaptivatingly to pantomime, and
the version of it written and produced
by George Ross and presented by the
Firm at Sydney Theatre Royal, is
gorgeous and arresting. There are 80 picked
panto artists, and seldom, if ever, has
fancy played more exquisitely around the
glass slipper and the girl who stepped from
a super’s part in the kitchen into the star
role of a transformation scene. But the
stage moves with the times, and Cinderella
goes to the ball nowanights in a helicopter;
next thing she will be spirited there in an
aeroplane. Marie Le Varre is a comely, gal-
lant prince, and Kitty Reidy a Cinderella
whose grace and appeal took her straight
into the audience’s heart. She sang her
snatches very pleasingly, too. Fred Bluett
is a Dame who might be modelled on one
of Dickens’s old women with a relish for
grief and “cowcumbers.” The fairies and
the humorists are well up to the mark;
the dancing admirable; and the scenery
varied and dazzling.
$ ❖ ❖
“The Sentimental Bloke,” at Sydney Pal-
ace, remains the one characteristically Aus-
tralian contribution to Christmastide jollity.
C. J. Dennis’s comedy is delightfully por-
trayed, and the reception accorded it should
be gratifying to the author, the producer
(Bert Bailey), and the players alike. Wal-
ter Cornock as the Bloke, Tal Ordell as
Ginger Mick, and Eileen Alexander as
Doreen, are workmanlike, whimsical and
winsome respectively in the racy setting that
Dennis has created for them.
* # * *
“Little Bo Beep” continues to lose her
jumbucks and find them again, according to
nurserv-rhyme precedent, at Sydney Grand
Opera House, and the grotesque bovine (who
bears a strong facial resemblance to some of
Reason’s milkers) is provoking shrieks of
delight. Madge Bilton fills the pants of
panto, boyhood with pleasing adequacy, Nell
Fleming is the last word in dainty shepherd-
esses, and the Dame (Dan Thomas) and the
dancers, the fairies and the sylvan scenes
the legs that whirl and the frocks that
shimmer, are all that could be desired.
Virginibus canto puerisque —as well, of
the “Mother Goose” panto, where Amy
Rochelle is a vision of joy as the principal
bov, and as principal girl Eve Gray is a
whirl of graces that thrill and. charms that
excel. A Helmsley as Dame is au fait at
the game; there is rollicking go in btitty
and Mo; and the monkeys and woods make
the Hippodrome seem a Sydney stage turned
to a tropical dream.
“MOTHER GOOSE,' ” AT SYDNEY
HIPPODROME.
Nat Phillips and Roy Rene as Stiffy and Mo.
At Her Majesty’s, Sydney, “The Arca-
dians” will pack up their sweetness .and
brightness in the kitbag after to-night s
performance, thereby enabling the decks to
be cleared for J.C.W.’s new musical comedy,
“Sally.” Josie Melville, of the mellifluous
name and the London reputation, is in the
title-role, and George Lane comes direct
from his triumphs in the Winter Garden
Theatre, where the damsel of the Alley and
the old ballad knocked Cockaigne.
From Parliamentary wrangles and trouble
that entangles would you be freed V Why,
then indeed to Fuller’s Theatre proceed and
step your soul in “Spangles.” Your cares
will leave when Ada lteeve has got you
fairly caught on songs from her lips—right
rich the quips and cranks of Gus McNaugli-
ton! For smoothing out life’s bumps and
angles our recipe’s a night at “Spangles.”
The round orbs of flappers, the optics
of knuts and the lamps of more mature
theatregoers are focussed upon the “Eyes of
Youth” and Emelie Polini at Sydney Cri.
It’s a play that gives the lady full scope
for her passionate emotionalism.
“Blood and Sand” is the top-liner at
Sydney Grand. This is the flick at which
W. M. (Nero) Hughes fiddled, in a manner
of speaking, while Nationalism was burning.
It was a suitable entertainment for one who
was, politically, in articulo mortis, being
replete with gore, hatred and violence. The
Lyceum has “Skin Deep,’ which is another
blood-freezer; and at the Rialto is “The Top
of New York.” The Strand is knocking
Madge Kennedy down to “The Highest Bid-
der” ; the Majestic contains “A Soul in
Torment”; and the Crystal Palace is ear-
nestly inquiring “What’s Wrong wdth the
Women” ?
“Tlior”: Alfred Butt, now a British legis-
lator, has shattered Old Drury’s panto tra-
dition, and is running his “Decameron
Nights” right through the period usually de-
voted to tights, the red-hot poker and the
string of sausages. With Alfred and Vesta
Tilley’s spouse, Walter De Freece within the
portals, and a couple of others hammering
to get in, Britain’s variety world has out-
distanced the "legitimate” politically. A
man like 11. B. Irving, with his deep studies
in criminology and kindred subjects, would
have found a useful place in the Commons,
but never aspired, and George Alexander got
no further than a seat on the London County
Council.
“Blackfriars”: Joseph Conrad’s first
play, “The Secret Agent,” which was pro-
duced at London Ambassadors’ Theatre a
month back, was as badly frostbitten as any-
thing seen there in recent times. An in-
censed manager blamed unfair criticism for
the funeral. “I will not say,” he protested,
“that I consider The Secret Agent’ a very
good play, but it hasn’t had a fair chance.
The chief attitude of those criticising Mr.
Conrad’s first attempt at play : writing seemed
to be that, because he is a brilliant novelist,
he should necessarilv be of the same stan-
dard as a dramatist.” Which might surely
be met with the retort that Conrad, a good
literary blacksmith, should be deterred from
trying' to be a fifth-rate literary linen-draper.

“Azrim” : The cable reports the death oi
Margaret Cooper, the soilgstress-at-the-piano
whom the Taits brought to Australia about
10 years back. Miss Cooper, who was accom-
panied by an unpopular young husband by
the name of llumble-Crofts, carried more
hauteur than was necessary for her position
in life. The fault lay with the good-natured
Dudleys, who, knowing someone who knew
her in London, proceeded to spoil her. She
did well here, but gave a lamentable dis-
play of Clapliam Junction superiority
before departing by telling an inter-
viewer what she thought of the “col-
onials." In South Africa she caused
a flutter in vice-regal circles by receiving a
Government House squad that arrived lats
at one of her shows with a satirical musical
accompaniment. As each Personage sal;
down, the artist emphasised the act with a
bump on the bass, and the outraged press
devoted much space to her rudeness. Never-
theless, with all her personal shortcomings,
she was accomplished in the art she made
so attractive. She used her light voice
very well, and her sense of humor was keen
enough to win her a large following in Lon-
don vaudeville 'heatres.
“Dido” : George Musgrovc was standing in
front of his theatre in a Maoriland town. He
had been running grand opera for three
nights, but previ-
ously for some
time' the theatre
had been used only
for glove contests.
While George was
sauntering up and
down watching the
enthusiastic popu-
lace rushing past,
he was presently
accosted by a young
man who said;
“H ey, mister,
what’s the fight to-
ri ight?” George
groaned inwardly,
but outwardly he
smiled. “Madame
Diego versus Sig-
nor P. Lonio,” he
said. “Strewth!”
cried the youth,
“I’ll have a couple
of bobs’ worth of
that.” In the first
interval the youth
waylaid George
again. “Call this
a fight?” said he.
“Yes,” replied
Musgrovc. “What
do you call it?”
“Gorstrutli, they
ain’t struck a
blow up till now.”

director, “Dick Whit-
tington” panto, at

“Alt,” said the gifted management, “you
wait till the next act.”
“0.K.” : Hugh Ward practically started the
war with the J.C.W. firm by lowering the
prices and advertising the cast of charac-
ters, in the order of their appearance, for
the new show at Melbourne Princess’s. This
was surely the unldndest cut of all, seeing
that when J.C.W. decided to charge for
programmes the Firm at once carefully dis-
continued all mention in the advt. of the cast
of characters, so that nobody in the audience
might escape the temptation to buy a bill
of fare to see what the play was about, and
who was who when the curtain rose.
“Abbot Park”: Bendgo (Vic.) recently
saw Phillip Lytton in the role of de-
fendant in a court case. Having pitched
his tent and given a dramatic show on a
vacant allotment he was charged with vio-
lating some old city by-law. Counsel for the
defence adroitly submitted that the tent
theatre was the property of “Phillip Lytton
Limited,” and that Phillip couldn’t be helu
responsible for the nefarious deeds of
Limited. It worked. Case dismissed.
“Orb”: “Nimshi’s” appreciative recollec-
tions of George Thorne (B. 21/12/’22) re-
mind me that his son George comeded here
for some years. He blew in from booth
Africa, worked with Meynell and Gunn for
some time, and was “on” in Oscar Asche’s
“Kismet” Also, he was right through Aus-
tralasia with Nellie Stewart, when she
Sweet-Nelled from Invercargill to Cbillagoe.
George, jtin., then left for U.S.A. He was
a decent actor and a decent chap.
“Caesar's Ghost”: A daughter of the
Brown Potter dame has just seen the cur-
tain fall on a Marathon U.S. law suit, in
which she has been starring since the be-
ginning of last year as a figure of wronged
innocence. Her husband, a millionaire
bank e r, alleged
that her cheeild
was the conse-
quence of a lapse
with a French-
Canadian guide,
and refused t o
support it —or her.
The great heart of
the mug-public was
stirred by the an-
nouncement that
the lady had re-
fused £20,000 to
parade her sorrows
in a film, and
when the _ Court
stepped in and
awarded her ali-
mony at the rate
of £lO,OOO a year,
many of the audi-
ence were so
worked up that
they swallowed
their gum. On the
half-caste person
denying the
authorship of four
tropical love-let-
te r s alleged t o
have been posted
from his native
wilds the lady was
awarded (1) a
certificate of snow-
white innocence,
(2) a fortune for
her son, and (3)

“T. 0.1.”: The date of the first theatrical
production in Australia is January 16, 1796.
The place was, of course, Sydney, and “The
Revenge,” a tragedy, was the play; the com-
pany consisted of male and female “exiles.”
It was on that occasion that the prologue
accredited to George Barrinsrton is alleged
to have been spoken. Whether written by
Barrington or not it contains about the wit-
tiest couplet in the world. Not so well
known is the fact that someone got away
with the “gate,” which, considering all the
circumstances, w-as exquisitely appropriate.
“S.T.S.”: I wouldn’t suggest that “Star-
gazer’s” yarn (B. 14/12/’22), of Harry
Rickards and the rotten serios “kept for the
express purpose of playing people out,” is
other than fact ; but it all happens in an O.
Henry story too. And happens better, for
there the show was a continuous one, and
there urns an obvious advantage in empty-
ing the house to make room for newcomers,
while Rickards seems to have gone to need-
less expense, at the end of a fixed programme,
merely to gain a minute or two in hastening
away the crowd which “should have been well
off home” in any case. In the American
story, by the way, things hapnened in this
order: (1) The youth employed as “chaser”
was so thoroughly rotten that he was told
it would be a steady job- (2) on the
strength of this he got engaged to be married ;
(3) the resultant happiness made him a
shade less awful as a performer ; in conse-
quence of which (4) he lost his job.
“Kem”: That the Firm is already noticing
the existence of the Ward-Fuller combina-
tion is shown by the advt. of “The Forty
Thieves,” which states that “Children can
see it for sixpence.” This line has long been
the Fullers’ annual slogan in Melbourne,
and J.C.W., Ltd., had no compunction in
annexing it to advertise a belated desire for
cut rates as regards the young. One reform
that Ward should endeavor to bring about
is the abolition of cloakroom and programme
charges. If he provided menus and hatpegs
gi'at-S he would cet a cheer that would be
heard in Cape York.
‘•X.”: There is a yarn that in Oscar
Asche’s schooldays in Melbourne his head-
master refused to let him join the Grammar
Dramatic Club, “as it would only be a waste
of time.” Melba had a s.milar experience
in Townsville (Q.), soon after her marriage
to Captain Armstrong. A concert was in
process of arrangement in aid of a local
charity, and Mrs. Armstrong (locally known
as “missus of the bloke that rents the oyster-
beds”) offered to sing. The concert com-
mittee rejected the proposal on the ground
that she wouldn’t be up to the Townsville
standard.
“Ganeslia”: In virginal modesty Oscar
Asche follows the Beerbohm Tree and
Wilson Barrett tradition. But Bar-
rett still holds the record. Max Beer-
bohm relates how he was sitting next
to an old actor at a characteristic
Barrett show. The opening scene resounded
with rumors of the hero’s mighty deeds.
Then an excited rabble rushed on. A stately
procession followed, led by white-robed
priests and musicians blowing long trumpets.
A band of warriors with glittering weapons
followed. Maidens came next, gracefully
scattering roses. There was a moment of sus-
pense, during w|iich the old actor turned
and said: “I wouldn’t be surprised if this
were Barrett!”
J.F.H. (London) : The scholarly Forbes-
Robertson, whom the Williamson firm would
have brought to Australia if the Kaiser’s
head hadn’t burst in 1914, recalled at the
Press Club dinner that he studied the busi-
ness of acting under Samuel Phelps, and
began his stage career (at 20) in 1873.
“There has been a wonderful advance since
then,” he said. “Playwrights can now deal
freely and frankly with subjects they were
afraid to touch in 1873. There were great
getors in those days, but the general stand-
ard of acting is now considerably higher.”
lie went on to say that “after nearly half-
a-century of arduous toil, living frequently
from hand to mouth, but always optimistic,
his career had closed. He was the finest
Hamlet of his generation, and it is a pity
Australia couldn’t have seen him. in liis
prime.
“Norbell”: As evidence that Brough did
sometimes countenance Australian mum-
mers, "L.11.P.” cites eight actors as having
been members of the Brough co. (B.
28/12/ ! 22). But those he mentions were
only “casuals,” so to speak. One of them,
Harry Roberts, complained to me of the
very small part allotted to him, and subse-
quently resigned in disgust. But “L.11.P.”
might have expanded his list very consider-
ably. Gregan McMahon, for instance, had
a fairly long spin with the Brough co. So
did Percy Walshe, who took on Brough’s
part at short, notice in “The Second in Com-
mand.” H. A. Gi-attan, who “held the book”
(prompter) and his wife, Ada Rochfort, hr.d
xr good engagement, and Mclntyre, the s.-m.,
was an Adelaide man. All these toured
India, Burma and the East with the co.
But the fact remains that Brough had little
admiration for the local Pointer. I know
a chap who put the acid on Robert for a
small advance. “Seems to me,” said Brough
testily, “you—ah—Australian actors are
always in financial trouble.” Bi’ough him-
self was one of the indirect causes of the
pecuniary stringency, though he, like every
theatrical manager, liad his little monetary
troubles sometimes.
“L.E.”: If we ai-e really going to see a
number of good plays, by Pinero, Somerset
Maugham, Galsworthy and other heavy
weights, as George Tallis promises, the
audience will have to do a bit of
anticipatory training. For a long time
we have had little in the way of
drama except a few samples from U.S.A.,
which have no connection wuth the subject
anyway. People will probably appi’eciate
the change from “Johnny-Get-Your-Gun” to
Galsworthy, once they get used to it. Gals-
worthy’s “The Skin Game” is an interest-
ing play, one of his best, but a tough propo-
sition to those who expect conventional char-
acters and mechanical situations. But the
production of a few good plays would soon
dreate a keen and intelligent audience. In
the old days Brough and Boucicault had an
audience that appreciated the best w r ork of
the period: and to-day there are just as good
plays written, probably better, that ought
to attract a similar audience if they are
given a fair chance.
“T.W.”: Australia’s old-time pianistic
idol, Mark Hambourg, receives it right in the
neck from the London critics now 7, but they
don’t seem to be able to guide the erring mul-
titude away from his recitals. The Times
complains that Mark’s “playing at his second
Chopin recital was no less full of manner-
isms than his first. It has now no l-hythm
and no proportion, and the effect generally
was one of disorder and restlessness.” Of
course, Hamboui’g, with the history of many
Times errors in ci’itic'sm to back him up,
notably its er’evously flabby receptions of
Melba and Paderew'ski at the outset, might
retort that the ancient broadsheet itself
never had anv sense of proportion, and was
full of critical disorder. 1 heard him less
than two years back in Chopin and other
work, and was amazed to find that he had
dropped most of his boisterous mannerisms,
and was playing like a tone-poet.
“THE ARCADIANS,” AT HER
MAJESTY’S, SYDNEY.
George Gee as Peter Doody singing “I’ve
got a Mot ter."
“Thorold Waters”: Asche’s mummers
must be a spiritless lot of hirelings in
very deed if they can stomach un-
protestingly their master’s affirmation that
“these fellows lose their voices in half-an-
hour nowadays, and I have to teach my
whole company stage technique, from the
supers up.” Asche seems to believe that
technique and the use of the voice are both lost
arts except in his own person, but there are
actors in Britain, notably Henry Ainley,
Norman McKinnel, Leon Quartermaine,
Gerald du Maurier and Charles Hawtrey,
who can give Geelong’s noblest son points
and a beating in both branches. Their
natural hnd unforced elocution is the
pleasantest kind in the world to listen to
after an intensive course of Oscar’s Chu-
chin-chewing, whatever “these fellows” who
are with him may think of their model. I
feel pretty sure, from a fair acquaintance
with British mummerdom, that Asche would
have been able to pick up at ordinary market
prices a fine ensemble whose acting tech-
nique and vocal resource wouldn’t have
caused him a moment’s worry, but as to
letting him allude to them as though they
were bot-flies on an asche-tip—well, that is
another matter.
“C.McL.”: Ernest Wunderlich (B.
28/12/’22) says much that is true about
Wagner. He badly needs condensing; even
“Tristan,” the most heart-searching of all,
grows very tedious when King Mark begins
to lecture. But surely E.W., in saying that no
great musician has tackled “Faust,” has for-
gotten Arrigo Boito’s “Mefistofele” ! I heard
that in Padua a few months ago, when the
University imported the whole company of
La Scala, Milan, to do honor to its guests
at its 700th birthday. This opera, which is
so vast that it is very seldom performed,
even in Italy, impressed me as being quite
as great as anything either Wagner or Verdi
ever wrote. The squalid little episode of
Marguerite only occurs in one act, and the
music there is less beautiful, less haunting
than the rest. It seemed to me to be a philo-
sophic discourse in music of the influence of
love upon man during recorded time, from
Helen of Troy onwards, and its vastness and
beauty are almost inconceivable. I do not
understand Italian very well, so I may be
wrong in believing that one of the characters
—in the Prologue—is the Almighty ;if that
is true it would account for the rarity of the
performance in English countries. It would
be too shocking—what? But it is worth
while being shocked to hear Helen of Troy’s
song in the last act, with its dreamy beauty.
Yet it is the only opera Boito ever wrote; he
acted as Verdi’s librettist during his later
great period, and only tided his hand at
music when he was an old man. It only
shows how it is never too late to mend.
“Coot”: Outside the pitcher-theatre at
Northcote (Vic.), the principal item on the
programme was billed as
The Diary of a Princess 3000 feet long.
TO A FAT ACTOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You may not pose as Ilamlet now,
Though solid was the prince’s shape—
Too bulky is your binge, I vow,
The melancholy Dane to ape.
No Prince of Denmark has been shown,
Who ranged well over nineteen stone.
As Romeo unfortunate
Again you’re barred, oh, mighty one.
Consideration of your weight
Bids you sweet Juliet’s, chamber shun.
You would not risk a balcony
(Jnstayed by irons ten by three.
As Falstatf you may make a hit
Clothed in your own obesity,
With waist which when at ease you sit
Reposes, sagged, upon your knee,
And thus we may your praises chime—
The greatest actor of all time!
You loom before contempor’ry eyes
A man of parts and greatly worth.
For like the morning sun you rise
In majesty to move the earth;
And now your measure critic boys
Must estimate by avoirdupois!

Pelagos: Sorry ; no use.... F.J.W.:
“Bellerive” would have a just grievance if he saw
that verse J.R.N.: Far too rugged... .C.M.M.: It
says too much without saying enough... .C.C.M.:
Misses K.R.M.H.: Nearly Chuck: Goes very
badly out of scansion and says very little.... Jean
A.: An ugly little thing....A.M. (Flemington) :
Doesn’t strike us.... Bruce B.: Far off. ... Milang:
Hasn’t quite the qualities of a first-class 1ie....
Horace F.: Terrible verse... .Douglas C.: Interesting
in its way, but hardly our style... .P.8.P.: The
hymn in praise of your bathroom misses its oppor-
tunities W.H. (Donald): The mountains loom
in very poor grammer, and are shrouded in dreadful
metre... .J.S.R.: A good enough picture, but not
much variation from the handling of the same theme
by others H.H. (Wellington): Good verse, but
not quite enough in the idea.... Vera C.: Yes, you
“scribble empty rhyme,” when you are not scrib-
bling horrible pretences of rhyme like “sort” and
“caught”... .Bellerive: “The Stowaway” has a fine
dramatic turn:—
A youth for petty charges—
Who was wanted by the law,
Stowed away aboard a vessel —•
Bound for a distant shore.
Away out upon mid ocean,
He was routed from the hold,
a And to the bearded captain
* A pathetic story told.
Tic me up and lash me,
The forfeit 1 will pay,
Before the hell of prison,
Appealed the stowaway.
“Lash you?” said the captain,
“You’re on a British ship,
Get to work, my laddie,
And square up for the trip.”
P.B.P.: No use F.F. (Northcotc) : Melodrama
of the dusty sort... .Cartet: Too long and loose for
the interest... .J.E.P.: Poor prose and unpleasant
verse.... Jack J.: The usual blood-in-the-bar yarn.
.... Ivlaney: The great wash of tears doesn’t move
u5....01d Drover. Only matter there for a par....
J.R.D.: No use sending us tortured prose under the
pretence that it is verse... .Echap: “According to
Viewpoint” not up... .C.C.8.: Bumpy verse which
does not rise above commonplace... .Newchum: Too
many people have fallen off horses in bad verse....
C.R.D.8.: No good here A.P.C.: A very unsatis-
factory creek... .Yaka : Not up... .A.W.D.: Don’t
like it... .C.0.K.: Both miss. “House” as a rhyme
for “cows” is not a striking success... .A.L. (Bondi) :
Shocking... .Sydney B.: Gets to nothing... .Alban
S.: Very poor stuff... .H.T.R.: Misses by some dis-
tance... .Oliver B.: “Rolling Scrub” has a sound of
genuine Christian endeavor: —
Blarst it. This beats all,
One can’t get along with this;
It’s right, it’s actual,
A lawyer can’t give advice.
Of all the jobs this is one,
First one thing, then another;
Mick swears he’ll pack up, go to Albion,
If things don’t go better.
Just fancy a whole week, nothing to show,
This would break, and that would break;
If you only knew half what Mi< k knows.
He’s broken nearly everything, barring e’s neck.
There goes the blanky chains and hooks,
Confound it; hooked up again,
Not to bad, not so bad as it looks,
We’ve got another hook and chain.
Right! Gee off, Flour 1
Stand ’em up, Lofty!
Give ’em a blow for a quarter of an hour,
It’s tough, it’s a case of inhumanity,
. ...1.M.W.: The verse is too lumpy to carry it....
E.M.P.: Very poor stuff... .8.C.D.: Too like too
many things N.A.M.: Not well enough done
G.F.C.: A bit too crude C.J. (Brisbane): Not
our style... .J.S. (Fitzroy) : Commonplaces that
have obviously no sincerity... .Bessie II.: There is
no more music in you at present than might be
wrung from a jew’s-harp... .11.J.8.: We don’t want
parodies, and yours is a bad specimen of the breed....
E.R.R.: Rambling and improbable tale badly t01d....
M.K.M.: The “poem” on the billy that sprang a leak
made straight for the basket. .. .F.V.C.: There isn’t
much yarn there... .H.R. (Subiaco) : “Exit” is a
miracle of bad rhymes. .. .C.F.M.: Crude stuff....
W.G.C.: Seems about as stupid as it could be made.
. ...A.F.S.: They are no g00d....E.L. (Windsor):
Very poor verse... .B.P.R. (North Sydney): Com-
monplaces and extravagances... .William H. W.:
Unfurl the lamentation: —
Oh, darling, why did you leave,
When you knew I loved you so ?
Why did you let another win your love?
Without a thought of me you left me broken hearted
And yielded to the embrace of another boy.
Now, joyfully you go to meet the lips of another,
While I sit silently and nurse a broken heart.
Oh, darling, how my heart aches for you,
For oftentimes I can hardly refrain from calling out
to you.
But, alas! I silently bare my woe.
H.S.K.: Nothing new; hundreds of kangaroo
hunters have had identical experiences E.G.S.:
A broody gobbler was paragraphed a month or two
ago... J. 8.: Impossible to do anything with stuff
so closely typed.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.0’8.: Draftsmanship faulty and treatment
wooden H.W.T.: All gone overboard together
J.L.: Misses T.H.D.: That bear gives it a sus-
piciously foreign 100 k... .B.B.: Not impressed by
your Billy as Napoleon; and something very like
the other has been done before... .K.P.: Call again
when you’ve grown up... .G.J.: You can get nowhere
without studying drawing... L.M.D.: Sketch in pale-
blue ink on ruled notepaper sent hence with con-
tumely.
“Pantagruel”: “Winkle’s” s.p. bookmaker
(B. 14/12/’22) has no claim to superiority
as a Malaprop artist over a reporter of our
local rag, who finished his account of a fight
with : “ , in the fifteenth round, delivered
the cul-de-sac with a terrific straight left.”
“Sierra”: On the afternoon of Christmas
Day a group of bored citizens surrounded the
sundial in Sydney Botanic Gardens. They
gazed at the mysterious gnomon and spelled
out the additions and subtractions engraved
around the dial. After much shaking of
puzzled heads and surreptitious glancing at
watches, one of them summed it up with: “I
serpose the dam’ machine’s right if a bloke
o’ny knew how ter work it.” Nobody sug-
gested cutting down the luxuriant clump of
bamboos, which leaves the time-indicator in
deep shadow.

Does that convince you of the
RELIABILITY of the
isTect
ENGINE
Here is the whole story; —
Eight years ago I purchased a 2\-h.y. “LISTER” Engine, and the.
Engine has always given the lest results.
When the Shepparton Freezing Woris were burnt down, the engine
did a non-stop run of 136 hours, pumping with a 2in. Centnfugal
Pump, through a Fire Hose, which I think is second to none.
(Sgd.) T. N. HOLLAND, Shepparton (Vic.),
For any sort of power work the “Lister” stands in
a class by itself—the Rolls-Royce of Farm
Engines. It is practically certain that during the
above-mentioned non-stop run, the “Lister” needed
absolutely no attention, except to be supplied with
fuel. And that’s a pretty useful sort of engine for
the man on the land.

bore the legend, “Kobe, Japan.” It was
just wanning up for a blistering day, a d
I had the curiosity to look at the readings on
a dozen of them. They ranged from 00°
to 80° Fahrenheit. A standard EngLsh
thermometer said it was 85.1°.

“F.A.”: The expansion of the shops in
Sydney (“Randolph Rentless,” B. 14/12/ 22)
is, doubtless, notable. But what about the
numerous city properties acquired durmg
the last three years by the “Bar Von”
fraternity? Martin-place, Castlereagh-
street, Maequarie-street and other main
business thoroughfares contain over half-a-
million pounds’ worth of property bought
by odds merchants within the period stated.
One purchase of a picture theatre by a well-
fixed fielder, only a few months back, nearly
touched the six-figure mark. No like move-
ment has yet been noted among punters.
“F. Clinton”: A couple of out-of-work
Diggers of my acquaintance have made
a rise by exploiting wild bees. Tney
pitch camp in a clump of likely-look-
ing timber, and after locating a nest chop
the tree down and smoke the hive-out. They
then burgle the colony and sell it. Occa-
sionally they lose the queen and the hive be-
comes useless, but there is still the honey.
It is remarkable the number of hives of
black Italian bees they come across. As
they operate within a radius of about 20
miles of Sydney they have no difficulty in
disposing of their catch.
* * » *
“Borom”: As long as opals, white or black,
were deemed unlucky, those engaged in
scratching them out of the rubble at Light-
ning Ridge and White Cliffs had their work
cut out to make a living. Then a couple
of enterprising merchants who dealt largely
in the stones-hired a capable press-agent to'
disseminate floods of matter on the subject
of “lucky black opals,” and things have im-
proved considerably. Nowadays there is a
keen demand for black opals, in America
especially, and a brisk trade is done in ex-
porting them from Sydney to San Francisco.
Gem smugglers have also turned their atten-
tion to the business; the U.S. thumping
duty on all precious stones ensures - that.
One of the stories current i« of a successful
smuggler who managed to evade the Cus-
toms officials by removing the works from
an old watch and carrying the stones inside
it, so that half-a-dozen opals which he
bought in Sydney for about £lO each trebled
in value during the crossing of the Pacific.
*** - *
“T. 0.1.”: One of the earliest cotton-
growers in Australia was Colonel de la
Clampe, a French royalist refugee. Dis-
daining to live on charity in Eng-
land, he came to Sydney and obtained
a grant of land at Castle Hill. M. Peton,
historian of the French Exploring Expedi-
tion, visited his countryman in 1802, and
describes “a beautiful plantation of cotton
plants, yielding cotton of various shades,
and especially that peculiar to the fine nan-
keen of China, a fast color hitherto nqt_ ob-
tained, whether by dint of culture or dyeing.”
The Colonel was sanguine enough, telling
Peron: “In a short time I shall have
created two branches of commerce and ex-
portation for this Colony of the greatest
value” (cocoa was the second enterprise),
and adding, “I have but this means left of
acquitting a sacred debt I owe to a nation
which gave me shelter in the hour of mis-
fortune.”
•** * *
“F. Clinton”: It sometimes pays to be
wedded but not churched. Under the N. S.
Wales Land Act the real estate held by a
man and his wife are taken into considera-
tion in connection with the granting of a
home maintenance area. There are cases
where a man has been living for years with
a woman who is not his wife, and has “truth-
fully” declared that the total holding in
which he and his wife are interested is that
which stands in his name —which obviously
doesn’t prevent the lady from holding land
in her own name, or the man from being
granted an additional area. Another strange
feature of the land law regarding a married
woman is that she may apply for, and be
granted land, provided she is possessed of
a separate estate. As a banking account is
considered a separate estate, all she has to
do is to beg, borrow or steal a couple of
pounds from the old man, open an account
and lodge her application.
* # * *
“U.P.”: To assist the Diggers on the
Murray Irrigation Settlements there has
been established at Barmera a Government
nursery, under the management of Byron
Gregory, formerly a Renmark nurseryman.
This year the nursery has distributed
3,700,000 rooted vine cuttings, which have
been replanted on the Cobdogla Flats, and
on land between Barmera and Loveday.
There are many different varieties, and the
vines include currants, sultanas and gordos.
It is estimated that about 90 Der cent, have
taken. This country may yet be known as
the vineyard of the Commonwealth. The
nursery is also experimenting in stone fruit-
trees, oranae-trees, Smyrna figs, American
beans, clover and cotton.
* * * *
“Topee” from his exclusive eyrie:—
“Lip’s” par. (B. 30/11/’22) bears the impress of
truth, so much so that I am convinced his “ ’igh-
clarss trade” merchant lives in the fashionable
Sydney suburb which I, at present, inhabit. We
wear more expensive stockings, or socks, as the case
may be, and at the same time sustain a greater num-
ber of mortgages to the rood than any other
community i.n the Commonwealth, and have thereby
gained the right to be scheduled by a’l city finan-
ciers and estate agents as an “O” district. We
affect fur stoles in winter, yet have to put up with
a horrible loaf of bread, baked expressly for rs, and
at which, for obvious reasons, we dare not squeal.
Our hold on our garages and tennis-courts is so pre-
carious that the tension has orlv been relieved by the
desperate enterprise of our leading families, who are
now housing myriads of horn-spectacled Japanese
paying-guests. It saddens me to admit that I can’t
clear out. I had a quid or two when T arrived last
year, but am now so seorohed by the local financial
aridity that X threaten to break out in cracks.

“Koreti”: “Chris” (B. 23/11/’22) is not
correct when he says that the late Utiku
Potaka's ancestor, Tamatea, “bossed” the
Takitumu canoe on its historic voyage from
Hawaiki to Ao-te-Itoa (Maoriland). Paikea
was the captain of that particular craft
At Macquarie Island, 1200 miles south of
Tasmania, there is a profitable industry in
boiling down penguins for their oil. The
island is under the control of the Speck Gov-
ernment. Not long ago it was estimated
that one rookery contained over 10 million
penguins during the nesting season, but the
birds are now being thinned out somewhat,
and the boiling-down works will shortly be
moved to another part of the island. In
December, 1923, the Australasian Ornitho-
logists’ Union propose visiting Macquarie
Island to investigate conditions and study
bird life there—that is, if the Federal Gov-
ernment can be persuaded to lend a boat
for the trip.
“Splinter”: Korea ought to be the next
field for Pussyfoot Johnson’s propaganda.
When anyone of the least importance at all
dies there he is carried to the grave by
sevei’al well and nobly sozzled pall-bearers,
who are specially intoxicated before taking
up their duties. The simple idea is that their
combined stagger will completely elude the
evil spirits that dart down to steal the body.
“Lexite”: A statement made some time ago
that the last Crimean veteran in Australia
had gone was based on the death of the last
member of the Veterans’ Association who was
in that rumpus. The other day, however,
Ernest Cramer, of Ilozelle (Sydney), cashed
in at the age of 8(1 He was a boy on the
London at the bombardment of Odessa. He
came to Australia with his brothers when 19,
and has left a moderate troop of descendants
and a widow behind him.
“O. Giddout”: Re “Ragar’s” reprimand
(B. 7/12/’22) on the colossal waste of
bullock-h.de due to indiscriminate branding.
For my part, I wish cattlemen of other
States would follow the example set by
Bananaland in the matter of shoulder-
branding. The shoulder and the belly are
considered only the “offal” of a h.de, or
side, of leather. The real stingo comes off
the back, from the fore-quarter to the nether-
land, and generally is worth about four times
as much as the shoulder. But zounds! in
about 20 years’ experience 1 don’t think i
have seen a dozen sides branded on the shoul-
der, and this is where I enter my complaint,
lustead of branding the animal for’ard, cattle-
men will insist on planting the gridiron
astern. Cattlemen raise the.r stock for beef
and m.lk, hence the trouble.
“F. Clinton”: The country beekeeper in
certain parts of N.S. VV., particularly around
Nundie, in the Tamworth district, has a
pretty rough spin when Crown land in his
vicinity is selected for settlement. In its
native state the land carr.es a lair percent-
age of honey-bearing trees. But when taken
up it is usually cleared, and with the clear-
ing goes the apiarists’ means of livelihood.
They have made some endeavor to have the
bees’ grazing haunts Drotected by asking the
Crown to put conditions in the leases pre-
venting the destruction of certain timber,
but the average cocky does not know a decent
honey-bearing tree when he sees one, and
good trees are likely to be sacrificed. The
best are yellow box, white box and red-gum.
“Cleveland” comes back :
Arthur J. Donne (B. 30/11/’22) assures me that
each pilot book published by the British Admiralty
Hydrographic Department is now sold at 10s., and
not at from 3s. to 55., as stated by me. Probably
he has some authority for saying so; mine (for
saying what I did) is the price-list following the
index in the volumes themselves. Having used them
for a quarter of a century, I have got accustomed to
believing them. In any case, if the Admiralty has
taken to profiteering on its pilot books, this is of
recent date, and should not apply to the volumes
I got. These were first edition 1914 issues, so that
it looks as if I got old stocks at new rates. I
know that pilot books are part of a ship’s outfit,
and I know how pleased owners are at paying three
times as much as formerly for them,, and I also know-
on whom they relieve their overwrought feelings.
I might add that there are dozens of small craft,
where the master is either owner or gifting on that
way, which pick a hazardous course along the reef-
strewn coasts of North Australia. To these men the
difference between ss. and 15s. is miich as I indi-
cated. I am charged With assuming that running
a chart dispensary is easy money. I frankly know
nothing about it, but “A.J.D.” would most likely
have thought as I do had he taken on running
ships. If what he says of the Admiralty’s raised
prices is true, the distributors of nautical publica-
tions in Australia, with only 60 per cent, profit on
their turnover, are not as bad as I said they were.
Old John Lewis, known to Adelaide as
“the Honorable John,” from his long ser-
vice in the Leg. Council, has produced a
book of reminiscences. He started as a
blacksmith’s apprentice, then took to the
bush. He was in the Faij North when the
Adelaide and Darwin wires joined ends, and
in the Northern Territory boom he was local
manager of about 16 mining companies,
besides owming stores and running mail con-
tracts by land and sea. He came south
just in time for the Broken Hill boom.
Lewis has a sequel to the familiar true yarn
of George McCulloch playing euchre with
young Cox to decide whether the newcomer
should give £l5O or £lOO for a one-fourteenth
original share in Broken Hill. It is well
known that McCulloch lost, but Lewis says
that, having accepted the £lOO according to
agreement, Mac. went straight off to the local
blacksmith, who had another share on sale at
£6O, and returned in an hour or two, point-
ing out that he had won £4O on the after-
noon.
“T.W.”: Now' that Frederick Bridge has
downed his baton, an effort is being made to
ginger up the Royal Choral Society, which
serves oratorio in the shell to vast multi-
tudes at London’s Albert Hall. Instead of
sticking to one conductor, it has got several
to boss its shows, including modernists like
Eugene Goossens. Adrian Boult and Albert
Coates, who tried to inflict Stravinsky on a
tortured w'orld. but it keeps some touch with
traditional respectability bv giving the stick
occasionally to Landon Ronald. To anyone
who has been addicted to the Royal Choral
Society’s brand of music, the new departure
must be almost as horrifving as a ukulele
band w'ould be in the Sistine Chapel.

Do You Keep Them
Clean?
Whether they are vulcanite or gold plates, they need careful
cleaning, for germs can collect on false teeth as well as real ones,
and they must not become scratched, or germs will find an abiding
place in the crevices.
Plaza Dental Soap is especially designed for cleansing artificial
teeth. It will not scratch or injure the most delicate plate. It is
good for the natural teeth, too, but its chief object is to clean
your false ones.
In a clear-glass container, it stands in a class of its own—
the latest and most scientific cleanser that any dentist can recom-
mend. Take care of your false teeth!

The Valley of Summer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT is night in the Valley of Summer; day
hushes her temple gong ;
Only the star-blanched river wakens
and sings its song.
And surely yonder u'emoies, ,n skies that
are st.ll and deep,
Peace, like a moon at crescent, drenching the
world in sleep.
There is peace in the Valley of Summer, but
here at my heart unrest;
And a strange wild dream, beloved, of fate
and a wanderer’s quest.
You are the Summer’s sister, but I—ah,
sweetheart mine!
Ours is the love forbidden, the love ot the
palm and pine!
You wake, when the blossoms brighten, and
life flames out to the dawn,
As a swimmer leaps to the wave-crest, as the
eagle swoops to the fawn —
Wake to the day’s perfection and the pas-
sionate joy youth knows,
With body superb and tireless, and soul
l.ke a summer rose.
Not yours are regret and pining, and sor-
row’s cancerous years;
Your grief is a flower at dewtime, weeping
its starlit tears.
Here in the Valley of Summer the magic of
passion’s gleam
Clothes you about as with splendor of girl-
hood’s golden dream!
But I! I must make my singing that tells
of another’s bliss,.
For this is the fate upon me —never to
swerve from this.
Tis I that must dream and wander, blind
harper of all desire;
Though happiness lingers calling, calling
w r ith lips of fire.
Ah, far is Nirvana, surely, when love is at
strife with dreams!
Love sits long with contentment by the
hearthside's ruddy gleams;
But my dreams must seek forever a joy that
shall never be—
Lost birds in a haunted darkness, lost ships
on a phantom sea.
It is night in the Valley of Summer, and
even my heart grows still.
So let it be, beloved; let the great gods have
their wi11....
I am a dreamer, sweetheart, and you are a
cPeam of mine,
Ar.d s is a love forbidden, the love of the
n and pine.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
T young men rede towards Devine’s
I slipraiis-—one along the road from
the township, the other by the track
from Higgins’s farmhouse. A curtain of
leaden-colored clouds unrolled across the
eastern sky, long plumes of red dust trailed
inertly behind the horses, and through a
haze of smoke from the fires, which had
been burning in the ranges for weeks, the
sinking sun glared across timber land and
parched plain.
The man who rode by the track reached
the slipraiis first and pulled up his horse
across the narrow road. As he greeted the
other rider, the tightly-drawn, leathery skin
round his mouth wrinkled in a grin, and a
humorous smile lighted the brown eyes.
“Thought it was you, Jim.”
Jim pulled up a few yards from his mate
He was red-haired, more compactly bui.t
thicker in chest and shoulders and straighten
in the back than the tall, lean man who
sat loosely in the saddle, with long back bent
and one shoulder higher than the other.
“How do, Bill? Been : hot to-day,” said
Jim.
“Hotter than the hobs of Hell, agreed
Bill.
For a moment the men’s glances met in
the brief, frankly questioning staie of mates
w r ho have grown to read each others
thoughts. Then Jim glanced towards the
ranges and fidgeted slightly in the saddle.
“Say, Bill, I thought you mentioned this
morning you were going over to Parker’s
to play crib to-night?”
The seemingly casual tone did not deceive
Bill. He smiled.
“I was dinkum wdien I told you that,
Jim; but I couldn’t face a couple of hours
with old Parker a hot night like this. He’s
too particular for my liking—won’t allow
a drop of hard tack on his place. I thought
I d ride over to Devine’s ; old Tim has always
got a drop in a decanter. But, by the way.
Jim, didn’t you tell me you’d be staying in
the township to-night?”
Jim turned his head sharply and met Bill’s
searching gaze with a guilty grin.
“I meant to stay in, Bill, but I found
there was nothing doing in the township—
beer has run out —so I decided to come home.
At the post office I saw an urgent letter
from the Lands Department for old Devine.
I thought I’d bring it out to him to-night
on the way home.”
Bill accepted the halting explanation with
a grin and swung his horse alongside Jim’s
chestnut.
“Just a tick, Jim.” he said in a confidential
tone. “I’ve been doing some thinking late y
and I reckon, now we’ve met l.ke this and
both plead guilty, we’ll have a bit of a
stra ght talk—between mates.”
“Go ahead.”
Bill spoke slowly while he gazed dreamily
at the drifting cloud curtain. “First, we’ll
cut out the k ddin’. I don’t give a dam’
about Devine’s whisky, and I reckon you
feel the same about a Goi'ernment letter.”
“That’s right.” Jim admitted, keen blue
eyes watching his mate’s face closely.
“We’ve ■ been mates a long time now,
haven’t we. Jim?”
“That’s right, Bill. Ever since we were
bits of kids an’ were nearly drowned to-
gether in the big bend in the creek. Re-
member?” , , ' ,
“Yes. An’ I reckon we ve been the best
of mates, too. Never kept anything nor
showed any dirt? ’
“That’s right, Bill.”
A pause. Bill plucked at the hair on his
left eyebrow with thumb and forefinger—a
sure s.gn that he was getting into deep
water. Jim extracted a buzzy fly from
his right ear. Then Bill spoke with a jerky
laugh.
"X want to talk about Molly Devine, Jim.
I’ve fair done me block on her.”
“Same here, Bill,” Jim said casually.
“No need to tell me that. I’ve got to tell
you, though, that I w’ent over to Devine’s
a tew n.gnts while vou were laid up in the
township with that poisoned foot; and a
couple of times I was just going to ask
Molly to marry me, but I thought you might
reckon I’d stolen a march on you.”
A touch of sympathy softened Jim’s steady
gaze.
“I know, Bill,” he said quietly. “I felt
like that a few times I was out with Molly
—when yop khd the ’flu’.”
Another pause, broken by Jim’s low, ban-
tering laugh.
“Leave your blanky eve-verandah alone,
Bill.”
Bill grinned guiltily.
“Well, here goes,” he stammered. “So
far we’ve played the game, but when we’re
both shook on Molly it doesn’t hold we'll
keep on playing the game. It’s no use the
two of us going over there like we used
to do when we first took Higgins’s block on
shares. When we’re over there together I
catch myself watching an’ suspecting every
move of you with Molly.”
“Same here, Bill.”
“That’s no good between mates. Now, if
each of us has to play a lone hand for
Molly, we’ll soon- be making excuses to get
over there on our lonesomes, like to-night.
Then we’ll begin showing each other points;
an’ the dirt might creep in.”
Jim nodded. “Maybe you’re right, Bill.
You reckon because we’re such good mates
neither of us is giving himself a fair run
with Molly.”
“That’s it, Jim. Now, what about this
scheme? S’pose -we decide between ourselves
which of us is to have the first chance of
asking Molly to marry him. Say you get
first chance. You’ll have a month to give
it a fly, while I sit back and give you a
clear run. If Molly turns you down, then
I have a clear run for a month. If Molly
turns us both down—well, no harm is done,
and we can get sprung together to drown
our sorrow. But whatever happens we’U
still be mates.”
Jim stared towards the ranges anci
thought hard, while Bill watched his face
out of the corner of an eye. Jim turned
suddenly.
“It's the best way out I can see. How
are you going to decide?”
Bill slid out of the saddle. “Toss —here
and now. The winner goes on to Molly.”
Jim threw a leg over the saddle and faced
Bill.
“Got a coin to toss? I’m broke.”
Bill explored his pockets and slipped a
penny from the ticket-pocket of his khaki
coat. He placed it on a thumbnail. “Sud-
den death, Jim?” Jim nodded. The coin
spun in the air. “Tails,” Jim called. They
bent over the coin in the dust and looked
on the head of Edward the Seventh. For
a few seconds «Lm stared at the com, and
his shoulders seemed to droop a little. Bill
stared towards the sinking sun. Then Jim
lifted his head, forced a grin, and spoke
huskily.
“You’ve got a clear month, Bill. I’ll play
the game.”
Bill gripped his mate’s outstretched hand.
“I understand, Jim, old man. Yes, I’ll
take the letter along.”
Bill mumbled something to the effect that
he didn’t think there would be any blanky
change that night, swung the chestnut round
and rode along the track to the farmhouse.
BJI led his horse through the slipraiis.
“Boor old Jim!” he said. “He’s crackin’
hardy.”
Towards midnight Bill arrived home from
Devine s. He whistled gaily as he walked
fiom the stables to the farmhouse. In
the kitchen a kerosene-lamp burned dimly
bes de haif a bottle of beer and a clean mug.
A glance into Jim’s room satisfied him his
mate was asleep. “Poor oig uimi” he mut-
tered, as he turned up the lamp and poured
out the beer. “I s’pose he’ll get a bit of
a start in the morning when he hears Molly
has promised to marry me next Easter, after
we give up the block.”
He drank the beer, placed pipe and tobacco
on the table, and starched through his
pockets for a knife. Out of the ticket-
pocket of the khaki coat he drew an English
penny. He smiled at the cast of Edward’s
head. “You did me a good turn to-night,
Ned, old sport. If old Brit. had turned up.”
A half smothered gasp of surprise broke
from his lips. On both sides of the
coin was the head of Edward the Seventh.
Bill leaned towards the lamp and examined
the coin closely. The best double-header
he had ever seen. Therp was only one
fault. On one side a crack ran across the
King’s head from the eyebrow, through the
ear, to the base of the skyli.
Bill turned down the lamp wick, sat on
a kerosene-box outside the kitchen door,
plucked at his eyebrows, and stared towards
the dull red glow of the fires burning in the
ranges. How had the coin got into his
coat pocket? He had never seen it before
that day. Thank God, however, his con-
science was clear on one point. He hadn’t
cheated. He was unaware that the coin
was a double-header when he spun it for
Jim’s call. But Jim had called tails. He
hadn’t had Buckley’s chance of winning. Of
course, there was the other s’de of the nic-
ture. If Jim had called heads he, Bill,
would have lost the toss, and, probably,
Molly also. Bill felt certain in his heart
that the girl would have accepted whichever
of the two mates was the first to ask her.
But why worry? Jim was satisfied he had
had a fair spin. No, that wasn’t playing
the game. The straight thing was to tell
Jim of the accident and offer to toss again.
But wasn’t it too late for that? Molly had
promised to marry him. Could he go back
on that? When the mosquitoes drove him
into the house Bill was still wrestling with
bin conscience.
An hour after daybreak Jim aroused him.
Bill pulled on his trousers and followed his
mate ouside. The sun glimmered red through
a thick haze of smoke and the wind was hot
and acrid with the smell of burning grass and

2 UPPOSE, during the holidays, you, or one of
your family, meet with an accident! What are
you going to do? If you are wise, you will prepare
for such emergencies by having a box of antiseptic
Zam-Buk with you. As a first-aid” there is nothing

ends pain, stops bleeding, and draws out soreness
so quickly. Zam-Buk soothes, purifies and heals
your injuries and prevents them festering up.
Agcun, you never need to have a holiday spoiled by the tortures
ot sunburn, rashes or swellings if you have Zam-Buk at hand. This
pure herbal balm cools a fiery, sunburnt skin, ends the tingling and
smarting, allays the soreness, and prevents blistering. Zam-Buk is
equally good for sore feet, mosquito bites, cuts, bruises, sprains and
all skm injuries and eruptions.
Sunburnt While Swimming.
My pastiine during summer is swimming,”
writes Mrs. Haines, .of 380 King Street. West
Melbourne, and one hot day my back got badly
sunburnt. My skin was very sore and tender,
and I suffered severely. I always keep Zam-Buk
ip the house, and I had the balm applied to my
back night and morning. The first application of
Zam-Buk allayed the irritation and took the
heat right out.”
Itching Prickly Heat.
“Last summer I had a severe attack of
prickly heat,’’ writes Mrs. E. Cook, of Kennedy
Terrace, Brisbane. “It was impossible to keep
my hands away from the itchy surfaces. One
day I got a box of Zam-Buk, and the soothing,
cooling sensation it produced was really amazing.
Zam-Buk soon dried up the eruptions and re-
placed all old diseased tissue with a splendid
growth of smooth, clear skin.”

Bill turned towards the house. “Right,
Jim. I’ll be ready in a jiff. You get the
horses. _ And, Jim, tell the black boy where
we re going, in case any of Bennett’s crowd
come across here to see how we’re getting
on.
Crouched low in their saddles, Bill and
•Jim rode hard along the winding track
through the timber. Clouds of thick smoke
rolled overhead. Above the thud of the
horses hoofs on the dust of the track rose
the distant, sullen roar of the 10-mile-wide
hre; and through the smoky murk of the day
the dead, gaunt trees loomed like grotesque
spectres contorted with laughter at the sight
of two puny men riding into the arms of the
red destroyer.
A quarter of a mile from Devine’s farm-
house they swung round a bend, the horses
stretched out at a gallop, Jim’s chestnut a
couple of lengths ahead of Bill’s big black.
A sharp cry of dismay broke from Bill. Jim
swung round in the saddle, pulled up his
horse and rode back to the bend where Bill
was bending over one of the black’s front
legs. Bill straightened and brushed the
sweat and dust out of his eyes. “Poor old
Darky!” he said in a hollow voice. “He’s
settled,that off leg. Put it in a hole. He’ll
just be able to hobble.” Jim noticed that
mate’s lined face looked 20 years older.
“Good God, what stiff luck!” Jim mumbled.
Bill swung round and raised his voice in a
harsh shout, that showed his nerves were on
edge. “Don’t stand there gaping at me, Jim.
Go on to Devine’s and see if Molly and the
old man have got away. I’ll lead Darky.”
Jim rode hard towards the farmhouse.
Ten minutes later Bill led the lame horse
up to Devine’s well and found the stage set
for tragedy. Jim and Molly leaned over
■ the prostrate form of Tim Devine, who was
vpropped against one. of the troughs. Behind
them, flames and smoke and showers ..of
sparks rose from theibuming stables. Jim
swung round on Bill. “Stables caught fire,”
he explained, “The old man rushed across
lo get the horses out to make across to our
place. He went down in a fit or faint at
the; stable door. The horses got scared and
broke away. Molly pulled her father over to
the well. He’s coming round now.”
Bill glanced at Molly’s white, drawn face
and slid an arm round her shoulders. “Keep
your head, little woman,” he whispered.
“.Tim an’ mo ’ll get you out somehow.” He
turned to Jim. “What are you waiting
for, man? Take Molly up on the saddle
and ride like hell for that waterhole in the
creek just the other side of our block. There
is a few feet of water there. You can’t
afford to lose a minute.”
“What about you, Bill?”
“Me !” Bill shouted, pushing him towards
the chestnut. “My horse is lame. I’ll
take the old man. He’s a lightweight.
You get Molly away on the good horse.”
Jim side-stepped and edged Bill towards
the chestnut. “No, you won the toss last
night,” he growled. “I said I’d give you
a month’s clear run with Molly. You take
her on my horse.”
“No, no, Jim,” Bill protested desperately.
“That’s got nothing to do with this.”
While Molly helped her father td his feet,
Jim grasped his mate by the shoulder.
“We’ll toss, Bill. Winner takes Molly.”
For a moment Bill hesitated. Then he
slid a coin from his coat pocket and placed
it on his thumbnail. “What is it, Jim?”
“Heads,” said Jim, his voice husky with
excitement. The girl watched them with
dark, tragic eyes, hands clasped at her
breast. Bill spun the coin. It fell flat on
the red earth. “You win, Jim,” Bill said
quietly. Molly closed her eyes and bent her
head over her hands to hide the tears that
suddenly filled her eyes. Bill stooped to
pick up the coin, but Jim forestalled him by
dropping on his knees and cupping a hand
over the penny.
“Here, Bill, what’s your game?” he asked
huskily, dragging the other man down be-
side him. “You tossed with a double-header
and deliberately threw away your chance
of winning.”
Bill stared at the coin. “I dunno how it
got into my pocket,” he stammered.
Jim spoke rapidly, . jerkily. “I put
it there —the day I wore that coat
into the township—when you had the
’flu’. Young Blarney introduced this
brum in a game of two-up at the
pub. There was a row. I pulled Blarney
out of it and made him give me the penny.
He told me the crook head got cracked when
he was cutting the coin. The cracked head
is the crook side. Look.”
He pointed to the coin; the cracked head
was uppermost. “It would have been tails
in a d.nkum coin. You win, Bill. Go, quick,
take Molly on the chestnut.”
Bill gripped his arm with trembling hands.
“No, Jim, you go on the good horse an’ we’ll
be quits. I tossed with that coin last night
at the sliprails. I. didn’t know it was a
double-header, honest to”——
.Tim shook him off. and shouted. “I called
tails last night. The penny turned up the
dinkum head. I had. a good look at it. The
light was good and I would-have spotted the
crack in a second. You won last night.”
“You’re satisfied about that, Jim?” The
question burst from Bill’s parched lips in a
hoarse whisper,. .
Jim gripped his hand. “Absolutely, Bill.
It was all my fault—cutting that penny in
your pocket and about it.”
Molly rushed between the two men and
pointed towards the house. Along the track
horses approached at a gallop. The three
Bennett boys,” she cried hysterically. “They
are leading two spare horses. Thank God,
we’ll get away together.”
The three bushmen pulled up in a cloud
of dust. Jim took old Devine on the chest-
nut, Molly and Bill sprang on the saddles
of the spare horses; and the party started
on a desperate race for the waterhole, with
the black smoke rolling low over them and
the roar of the great fire growing louder,
more terrifying at every furlong. A halt
while the Bennett men cut a wire fence;
the last desperate gallop across a quarter
of a mile of stubble; then the waterhole
and safety! They saw the fire sweep past a
quarter of a mile away, and, as it went it
claimed for a victim Bill’s Darky—caught
half-way between Devine’s ruined farmhouse
and the waterhole.
Next morning, when Molly Devine stepped
out of the kitchen of Higgins’s farmhouse to
shake the breakfast cloth, she came upon
Bill and Jim. They faced one another and
a coin was balanced on the forefinger of
Jim’s right hand. “Good God, you two are
not tossing again!” Molly exclaimed. “That’s
right,” Jim replied. “We’re tossing to see
which of us is to keep this double-header for
a keepsake.”
Molly held out her hand. “No, you don’t,”
she said, with a smile. “That penny ought
to be tied down firmly on a chain, so it
won’t get you two into danger again. Give
it to me. I’m going to wear it on my silver
chain in remembrance of the best and brav-
est pair of mates that ever tossed a coin.”
W. K. KENNEDY.
The Unwritten People.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
UNDAY morning in London, and the
trees shaking their tresses across the
avenues of Hyde Park.
Overhead, the white sun flashed brilliantly
through the clouds, while my shadow, danc-
ing with excitement, visited English grass
for the first occasion.
New, unfamiliar voices increased my curi-
osity to an extraordinary pitch, and the
odd folk walking hither and thither made
me sad and' merry at the same moment.
Gathered about the park entrance and under
the softened light of an old arch, they ap-
peared like children of the mind whom
Dickens might have .dug out of corners and
byways, to be kept there and laid in reach
until such time as his genius should demand
the use of them.
Here stood, not Quilp, but Ned Jasket
and, behind him. Rosy Lurk, close to Mrs.
‘Clencher, with Alice’s baby in her arms.
Sir Persper Swettals, riding the Mortal
Terror, went, like ghost upon ghost, over
the tan.
Smoulder rattled Murder’s ha’penny in his
cup, and Yeenie Spavin, pursued from a dis-
tance by Slupp and Mupp, stopped for a
minute to assure herself that the three' cards,
in Hal’s leather case had not fallen out or
been stolen, and the Harkencat prophecy
come true in the end.
Mrs. Wowdidge biting little Fudge’s finger
to make him cry whenever Laura passed his
window; Millicent and Fanny Blame The
Royal Red Recorders on Bank Holiday,
1860, and again on the night Tom Holes Was
buried ; Sam Yewan nearly suffocated with
asthma; Tidd’s bottle of apple-water, and
the map of Seven Towers, done in blood, be-
hind the looking-glass of Janet Jasket’s room
—they were all there: the unwr'tten people,
the lifeless living, attendant on their Master
who can never return.
A modern Dante might have admired the
division of units and their subsequent
achievement to groups, the mixed hosts ap-
pearing and disappearing, knotting and un-
knotting, like frisky bacilli magnified under
a powerful microscope.
Against a board plastered over with num-
bers (five rows of "nines” and each row
ended with “three”) I observed a tall man
straining like a hamshackled horse, the crown
of his head presented to the onlookers while
his face communed with the dust upon his
boots. As lie waved his hands hurrying
words fell from his mouth and bounced up-
wards to a level with my knees.
“It’s not necessary,” he explained, “for
my father to commit a burglary. No sich
idea would ever enter iz zed.... ’E’s a man
in a large way of business.”
Then he paused, his face still pasturing
upon the grass, and his arms jerking in
silence below the gaze of enraptured apostles.
A smell of peppermints fought the odor of
an extraordinarily bad cigar in the suddenly
deserted spaces of the air, and I moved to
a further gathering where a woman, in the
breathless accents of an underbuttered muffin,
made the declaration that “Jesus Christ is
the expression of the everlasting essence of
God.”
A pale boy, who pushed one shoulder for-
ward while he talked, recited the thousandth
stanza of a metrical composition in praise
of Queen Victoria. All at once he finished,
but only for a moment, and, turning about
in his box, signified his intention of going on.
“Now, then, if you keep quiet and you
like poetry, I’ll give you a lot more.”
However, a shout of laughter from a dif-
ferent point drew me across the path to
where a collection of people, rtihning in a
circle, embarrassed somebody not yet easily
seen. The tide catching me up, I was car-
ried off my legs and into the Very bosom of
the object of their demonstration.
We hustled and pommelled one another,
but eventually escaped without mixture,
He was a short man, restless and accipi-
trine; his back hunched, as a hawk’s is
hunched at feeding-time, behind its wings.
His hair came down under his hat in flat
brown lengths, square at the ends, and
pressed against his pallid cheeks; and, when
he spoke, his lips bled, giving him the ap-
pearance of a wild island-man from over the
seas.
“Bir-r-r-r-r-r-r!” he muttered, and then,
raising his voice to a scream, “I’ve been
where men would stab yer for ’o,rf-a-loaf of
bread! So don’t you jeer!”
For one second the crowd waved inward
before the anticipated curse, but immediately
afterwards stood stiff with horror while he
spread out. his fingers to address some imag-
inary person they were unable to see.
“Woojer cut a man's froat for a bunch
of cat’s-meat? Woojer? Eh-h-h^h?”
At that a serenely gentle onlooker came
walking in kindness through the press and
gave to him the hand of eternal brotherhood;
across his tall grey hat appeared an ancient
bit of cardboard, upon which was written
the inscription:—
