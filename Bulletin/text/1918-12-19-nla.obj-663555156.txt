BEFORE THE MIRROR
By “JEANNETTE.”
These are. undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and
all of us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow
over the lives of many of us women, and while perhaps a few—the more
stoical among us —can avoid worrying over past and prospective events, we
may all, with a little care and forethought, succeed in preventing the results
of worry from being noticeable in our appearance. To these fortunate
few this little chat will, however, be as interesting and instructive as to
those who stand in real need of help in toilet matters, and may be the
means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown method of retain-
ing or regaining that beauty of face and figure which is the birthright of
every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present, not
generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
Wrinkles, ami How to Remove them. —Worry,
late hours or the passing of old Father Time
may cause those ugly little lines which so
detract from the freshness and charm of a
woman’s face; but the cure is always the
same. Feed the tissues beneath the skin, and
massage them with a reliable skin food, which,
while nourishing the fatty tissues, will not
coarsen the skin nor grow hairs upon the
face, as so many inferior creams do. To
remove the wrinkles, bathe the face with hot
water, wipe it dry, then, while it is still
warm, smear a little mercolized wax over the
whole face, carrying it well down on the neck,
and, with the tips of the lingers, rub it gently
into the pores, working in an upward and
outward direction. Wipe off any superfluous
wax, leaving a little on the skin all night.
In the morning wash off with warm water
and Pilenta soap. The use of the wax not
only feeds the skin, but removes the dead
outer cuticle, giving the fresh young skin
beneath an opportunity to breathe and show
itself.
Beautiful Haii —How to Shampoo.—Whether
the hair is luxuriant and glossy, or thin and
lanky, depends very largely upon the care
bestowed upon it. To keep the hair in good
condition it should be shampooed once in
every two or three weeks. Before shampooing,
massage a little pure olive oil or almond oil
into the scalp, then mix one teaspoonful of
stallax granules in a cup of hot water, fill a
basin with warm water, into which the ends
of the hair can full, and shampoo the stallax
mixture into the scalp in the usual way.
Rinse and dry by fanning with a palm fan, or
in the open air, ifthe weather permits. Should
the hair lie naturally very greasy, the oil
massage should be omitted. Stallax can be
bought at auy chemist’s in quarter-pound
sealed packages; it keeps indefinitely, and one
package contains sufficient for 25 or 30‘
shampoos.
A Greasy Skin and Blackheads.—Blackheads
are absolutely fatal to beauty, for they give a
coarse, dirty look to the face which no cos-
metics can ever hide. The way to remove
blackheads quickly and effectively has only
recently been discovered. For many years those
who suffered in this way were restricted in
their diet, denied sweets and had to suffer
other privations. Modern science has, how-
ever, provided a simple, effective and quick
remedy. Dissolve one stymol tablet in a
glass of hot water, and when the effervescence
has subsided, dip a small, soft Sponge into the
liquid and bathe the face. Leave for a few
minutes, then dry with a towel, and the black-
heads will come off. For a greasy skin bathe
the face three times a week with stymol and
spray with cold water every morning, using a
vulcanite throat spray.
To Improve the Eyebrows and Eyelashes.—
Long, curling eyelashes make the most in-
different eyes look attractive, and while no
one can alter the color, shape or size of the
eyes, all may possess luxuriant eyelashes and
well-shaped eyebrows. To increase the growth
of the eyelashes rub a little mennaline into,
the roots very gently every night. Mennaline
is a perfectly harmless and delicate pomade-
like substance which may be obtained at auy
chemist’s. For the eyebrows smear a little of
the mennaline on a small soft brush, and
brush into the eyebrows in a straight or
arched direction, according to how you wish
them to grown A month's treatment should
see a marked improvement.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
CAIRO.—No. I am not surprised at hearing
from a reader so far away, as I get letters
from every part of the world. I expect it is
the heat that has caused you to put on weight
So rapidly, and can quite understand how
much it adds to your age. Get a small quan-
tity of cl.vnol berries and eat one after each
meal. They will permanently reduce your
weight, are quite harmless, and yoti need
make no alteration in your diet.
QUEEN BESS.—Thirty is far too young to
have grey hairs, and you must not allow the
trouble to increase. . Get two ounces of -tamma-
lite. mix it with three ounces of bay rum, and
applv to the hair with a small, soft sponge.
This will restore the grey and fading hair to
its original color.
EMMELINE—For your mUddy-lookiug skin
get a tin of mercolised wax and rub a little
well into the face and neck every night. Leave
on 1111 morning, then wash off, using Pileuta
soap and warm water. This will remove the
dead outer skin and leave the complexion soft,
fresh and smooth. *
JESSIE. —To remove the hairs from the lip
and chin get an ounce of powdered pheminol
and use as directed. Then apply tokko paste
several times daily for some weeks. This com-
bined treatment will permanently remove all
trace of pair from your face.
FTIECKLRD LASS.—To prevent the freckles
from appearing use a cleminite lotion. Get an
ounce of cleminite and mix it. with four ounces
of warm water, allow to cool, then dab over
the face. This will not only protect the skin
from sunburn and freckles, hut will give it a
dainty fresh look far superior to the bloom
imparted by the finest powder. [3-

Zora Cross
The Red Page
Twelve months ago the appearance of
“Songs of Love and Life” interested the
Australian reading public. Here was a new
voice, clear, passionate and singing with a
frankness of self revelation. There was, of
course, plenty of carping criticism. Here
and there the voice of Mrs. Grundy rose in
slirill protest; but the melodious charm and
rich intensity of the work did not fail to
win applause. In the “Lilt of Life,” the
volume just issued by Angus and Itobert-
son, Sydney, Zora Cross strikes a deeper and
more forceful note. ‘Man and Woman,”
the chief poem in the book, is in
blank verse, a blank verse of fine melody and
■great flexibility which everywhere fits itself
to the movement of the narrative. The
song itself is the epic of the Dust —the
dust quickened with the eternal spirit of love
and motherhood and breathing strange ten-
derness under the feet of all mothers of men.
Hero women of the past, goddesses and saints
and lovers, move to music here; and through
their words of sorrow and hope there grows
the great wisdom that blossoms into
splendor as the motive of the tale is un-
folded. The development of the tale carries
witli it a strong surge of emotion.
While “Man and Woman” in some sense
overshadows the other work in the book, the
rest is not unworthy. There is a sonnet
sequence of great beauty and power ; many
of the shorter fugitive pieces will arrest
and delight; and the “Lilt of Life” is as
charming as the subject matter of the poem
is novel and striking.
The book is not faultless iu craftsmanship
or in thought; but the work throughout is on
a very high level, and marks a distinct ad-
vance on that published last year.
Smuts
The book of General Smuts’ Campaign in
East Africa, by Brigadier-General Crowe
(publishers, John Murray, London),' comes
as a reminder that while a stupendous
struggle was raging in Europe a campaign,
which in other times would have been re-
garded as a big proceeding, was in progress
just under the Equator. By Australians
the happenings in East Africa were, not
unnaturally in the circumstances, contem-
plated as trivial incidents in a side-show.
That is when they heard anything about
them. Mostly, however, they heard nothing,
or nothing except a few rumors. The job of
rooting the German out of his African pos-
sessions was, however, one of great magni-
tude, and the war a real war in every sense,
making heavy demands upon organisation,
leadership, endurance and courage. After
Botha had dealt with the German in West
Africa, operating from Walfisch Bay, the
situation over on the other side behind Zan-
zibar had to be attended to. General Smith-
Dorrien had been doing something in a mild
way. He was recalled to England. Smuts
took command. He made General Collyer, a
man trained entirely in South Africa, his
chief of staff. Of the rest of the staff not
one had previously filled a staff appointment
with troops. The greater number of the
supply and transport officers were settlers
who had never had military training. And
the forces Smuts had to handle made in
point of variety the materials for the most
job-lot army ever got together under a single
command- There were among others Bri-
tishers and Nigerians, Indians in great
variety of garb and speech, Boers, Baluchis,
West Indians and East Africans, West
Africans and South Africans. They were
black, white and yellow. They spoke Dutch,
Swahili, Hindustani and English and a mul-
titude of tribal languages and dialects. But
though there was at times grave difficulty in
finding officers who could speak the lingo of
particular regiments the babel of tongues
presented no serious obstacle to going ahead.
They were a lietrogeneous lot of brave, un-
complaining humanity, and Smuts worked
them hard—terribly hard—under frightful
conditions. To chase the enemy about on
the huge, trackless area he occupied would
have been futile. He had to be manoeuvred
out of it. At one time Smuts had 9000 men
down with sickness. In two months alone
he lost 10.000 horseS, 10,000 mules, 11.000
oxen and 2500 donkeys. Mechanical means
of transport were practically useless. Smuts
was ten months On the job. In a foreword
to General Crowe’s description of the cam-
paign, he says:—
It is impossible for those unacquainted with Ger-
man East Africa to realise the physical, transport
and supply difficulties of the advance over this
magnificent country of unrivalled scenery and fer-
tility, consisting of great mountain systems alternat-
ing with huge plains; with a great rainfall and
wide, unbridged rivers in the mountain regions
and insufficient water on the plains for the needs of
an army ; with magnificent bush and primeval forest
everywhere; the malaria mosquito everywhere, ex-
cept on the highest plateaux; everywhere belts
infested with the deadly tsetse-fly, which make an
end of animal transport. And everywhere the fierce
heat qf equatorial Africa, accompanied by a wild
luxuriance of parasitic life breeding tropical dis-
eases in the unacclimatised white. ... Unseasonable
rains cut off expeditions for weeks from supply
bases. Animals died by the thousand. Mechanical
transport got bogged in marshes or was held up
by bridges being washed away. And the gallant
boys, marching far ahead under the pitiless African
sun, with fever raginer in their blood, pressed ever
on after the enemy, often on much reduced, rations.
In the story of human endurance this campaign
deserves a very special place, and the heroes who
went through it uncomplainingly and doggedly are
entitled to all recognition and reverence. Of them
their commander will remain eternallv proud. It
may be said I imposed too hard a task on them. I
do not think so. It was not possible to conduct
the campaign in any other way.
The enemy seems to have been handled with
skill and resolution by Yon Lettow. At the
end of a long stubborn fight he was beaten.
The author gives some interesting details of
the resource shown by the Germans when
supplies were cut off by sea. They manu-
factured spirit for motors, made cloth for
uniforms, tanned hides, started munition-
factories. and actually made shells. They
produced ample supplies of quinine, cocoa,
rope (from pine-apples), bags (from bark).
Tyres for bikes and motors were evolved by
tapping rubber-trees direct on to rope. Ben

YOUR automobile in one re-
spect is like any other piece of
machinery. It “settles down”
only after use. If well maintained,
it will run better the 2000th mile
than the first.
Motor trouble and undue noises
are too often caused by ear ly neglect.
The metal worn off by friction is
gone for ever. And your lubri-
cating oil is your only protection
against this friction wear.
At all times, and especially dur-
ing the important “settling down”
period, when the moving parts
have not fully adjusted themselves
to each other, oil of the highest
lubricating efficiency is of the
utmost importance.
Each piston makes several thousand
strokes per mile.
The effects of the wrong oil will not be
noticed during the first piston stroke, or
the second. But when the piston strokes
run up into the millions-and that does
not take long—friction begins to get its
due. You do not have to look for the
wear then. You hear it.
Realising the need of scientific help in
correct lubrication, careful motorists are
guided by the Vacuum Oil Company Pty.
Ltd.’s Chart of Automobile Recommenda-
tions (printed, in part, on right).
The oil specified insures high lubricating
efficiency through its correct body and
superior quality,and throughout the life of
the car insures a low operating cost per
mile.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Kinship.
In all my garden there are but few flowers—
Can they be mourning for the flowers of
France?
For those few droop throughout these peace-
ful hours,
As though in grief at some unseen mis-
chance.
Alas! last summer gentler flowers may blow
But to be crushed beneath the wheels of
war.
Here is no war to crush, yet blooms lie low
As though some equal curse had passed
them o’er.
I raise their heads; they shrink to face the
sun ;
I give them water and I tend them well,
And still they fail when day has scarce
begun,
And slowly fall their petals like a knell.
Throughout the world can there be brother-
hood
Among the flowers that feel each other's
woe ?
Do my flowers faint because, in some far
wood,
In tortured France, their sisters are laid
low?
Spain.
JAMES WEBB.
The Broken Heart.
A wind came whispering of many things
To a garden set apart,
And, it seemed to me, on its scented wings
It carried a broken heart.
The heart of a woman that could not rest
Except in the hush of a blossom’s breast.
Have they buried her out in some arid place,
Wire fences and long grey plains,
With the yellowing grasses above her face
Where the cracked earth, crying for balm
of rains,
Under the frown of the cloudless skies.
Lets the sun slip through to her tear-sick
eyes?
The wind throbbed into a lily's cup ;
It cried like a babe o’er a withered rose.
And it climbed to the linked wistarias up.
And rippled clown where the lupin grows.
Till the dust of the woman’s heart was set
In the moist, sweet greenness of mignonette.
The noon is here, and the breezes flag;
But a bee who bid in the mignonette
Wings heavily with its treasure-bag.
Such full reward has its delving met!
That I think, as I watch the laden start.
“There was honey still in that broken heart!”
QUEENSI-AND.
M. FORREST.
Confetti.
I walked through the streets of God.
And the world was a clamorous joy,
The daisy laughed from the sod
At the feet of the leaping boy ;
The old trees clapped their leaves.
And the young trees sang in the wind ;
And over the hedges were sheaves,
AVheaten and full and kind.
Pollen and blossom there fell
Ever and ever on me—
Dust of the world to tell
How light were the airs and free.
Uprose the shout of the wave.
Green and curved for the shock,
And a line spray, salt and brave.
Sprang with a lilt from the rock.
Sweet on the dry of the land
Pattered the soft rain.
That the grasses might understand
It was green-time again ;
And a blusterous wind blew
With a whistle of mirth in its mouth,
As the round drops flew
To the gay dance of the south.
Spring, with a merry throng.
Came tossing the boughs apart
With a shower of broken song
To scatter about my heart.
Autumn passed with a sigh ;
And the red leaves rustled and ran
Zig-zag from branches high
To drop on the soul of a man.
Out of the dark of the night.
With a thin moon watching all.
From the drift of the stars white
I saw the skies fall,
Glistening down in a stream
Over a quiet place;
And out of the heart of my dream
Your face —your face !
n.s.w.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
The Message.
To the clear ones in the distance they are
sending love and greeting
That the .future may be cloudless, and the
long years void of pain,
That the gracious spirits guard them till
the splendid hour of meeting;
But for you. O heart's beloved, there
shall be no grief again.
Though we have no hope of meeting, nor of
any glad to-morrow —
While the proud tears gather slowly I
can lift my eyes and say:
“Not in vain the soulful giving, and the
heartache and the sorrow.
For the dream you fought and died for is
a living thing to-day.”
On this day that we have longed for I shall
harbor no regretting,
That would mar our perfect triumph in
the splendid dawn of Peace;
For I hold your love, forever, and there
shall be no forgetting
Through the march of long years after
until life itself shall cease.

MOTOR CAR
Its Goodness is alone responsible
for the unusual demand tbat has
existed right from the beginning,
Nothing has ever disturbed the demand for this Car. No out-
side conditions, no conditions inside the industry seem to slow
it up a particle. The people want the Car more intensely at
this moment than ever they wanted it before.
The Car has reached the stage when its sales are almost auto-
matically increased. By this we mean that one sale is almost
certain to result in one or two other sales.
* • ,; v . " . - • %
There is a very pronounced and definite public opinion now in
this country concerning the Dodge Bros. Car.
People seem to know that Dodge Brothers’ idea, from the very
first, was that if they built the Car right, nothing else mattered.
It is- the quality revealed in its performance which makes the
price impressive. People are attracted by something more than
price; it is the internal and external excellence which
characterises the Car.
The high price it demands when sold second-hand increases the
respect in which the Car is held.
It would be hard to find a truer test of enduring worth. People
are not eager for used Cars unless they know tliat such Cars
have before them a long life of satisfactory service.
And so the Dodge Brothers Car is
bought, not upon price, but upon the
quality and value that it embodies.

A FOOL AND HIS BONUS ARE SOON
PARTED.
"What Australia needs most, according to Mr.
Meadows Smith (a member of the French Mission,
and Hon. British Consul in Paris); is more population.
“After having travelled all over Australia, says
Mr. Smith, “I am convinced that Australia wants
more population. In my opinion it would pay the
Commonwealth not only to provide free passages
for the best class of English labor, but to give a
bonus so as to induce the British worker to come
here.”- —S. M. Herald (9/12/’18).
It seems a pity that the Hekaed should bore
the public, with the news that a man named
Smith believes this country could do with
more population. Smith thinks he has
“travelled all over Australia” ; but he hasn’t,
lie has seen only the densely-populated parts.
If he had travelled all over the lonely parts,
which probably no single human being has
ever done, he would be raving mad with the
loneliness. The crude remarks ot Smith aie
an pffence. but he can hardly be blamed. He
probably thought Australia was an ordinary
place, and unless he lived here for some yeais
he couldn’t be expected to know how extra-
ordinary it is. The idea of this country im-
porting “the best class of labor” is grotesque,
seeing that it has so systematically hindered
its self-supporting industries that it hasn t
any clear idea what to do with its own few
people who are coming back from the war
(about one to every 12 square miles), except
by putting them into the nearly bursted agri-
cultural industry at the cost of an average
bonus of some £2OOO per man, all borrowed
money. And the agricultural industry lives
on a bonus even at its present: N. S
Wales alone pays some £700.000 or £BOO,OOO
a year bonus to carry agricultural produce on
its railways below cost, and what will hap-
pen when there is a lot more to be carried is
too dreadful to think about. The whole rail-
way'system lives on a bonus —last year the
Queensland railway system received
£1,041,471 as aids from the revenue, and the
Federal railway system £394,227, and the
N. S. Wales railways and other State enter-
prises £525,111. This is the Bonus Country,
including some £650.000 for baby bonus, and
saying nothing about the proposed bonus on
gold, though there is something weird about
the proposal to pay money as a bonus on
money. It really can’t afford to grant allow-
ances and free passages to British immi-
grants as well. Besides, it doesn't want to
import Bolsheviks, and any chronically work-
less man who has to fill in his time listening
to Domain orators is liable to become one.
This country must re-import its own soldier
people, and in the absence of reliable employ-
ment for them it faces the job with fear and
trembling.
Smith plainly doesn’t understand our
wonderful Government, though he may have
met it at lunch. Probably it is hard to real-
ise such a Government. It was plain, early
in the war, that there was a danger of new
manufactures starting here through the tem-
porary shipping and importing difficulty, and
despite a tariff which marks “Free” or “5
per cent.’’ against nearly half the items. So
it put heavy restrictions on the investment
of capital in new industries lest the money
should be wanted to pay for the war, though
all the money that was going abroad to pay
for the war was money borrowed abroad.
Then it enacted that, new profits made in
war-time, by the establishment of new indus-
tries or otherwise, should be mostly confis-
cated. It keeps this confiscation going even
when the war is practically ended. It made
some small alterations in the tariff to reduce
the scanty Protection on local spirits, and in
its haste it so fixed things that local per-
fumery is taxed more heavily than the .im-
ported article. It made a new and joyous
departure by strictly limiting the advertising
of local goods, though importers may adver-
tise ad lib. It put a specially heavy income-
tax on those earnings of companies which
were not spent as dividends, but reserved —
possibly for the nefarious purpose of extend-
ing the business with new machinery, and
thus interfering with the importer. It put
restrictions on building, which might have
taken the form of run if in g up factories, and
on the patching of buildings which might have
led to the improvising of factories. It dis-
couraged an early attempt at private ship-
building on the ground that that should be a
Federal Government business, and then it
made a conspicuous failure of the business.
Lately it has added a few new details to its
Confiscation of War-time Profits, and makes
them retrospective for 24 years so as to fall
upon back earnings that have been already
spent. And all the time the increase in arti-
sans’ wages made the discrepancy of the
wonderful “Free” tariff more and more dis-
crepant. A combination of merchants who
dislike local industry because it interferes
with imports: and Bolsheviks who dis-
like it. because it interferes with that
chronic discontent which is the basis
of revolution—the revolution which may
end in the eating up of the merchants;
and speculators with dry land to sell to the
Repatriation Department to put miserable
soldiers on is rather in the way of self-
supporting industry.
Smith is groping in the dark. This
country doesn’t want to pay much bor-
rowed money in bonuses to “the best class of
English labor.” Smith, in fact, doesn’t
know the first beginnings of his sub-
ject. No country with lots of skilled and
well-paid work to offer needs to buy workers.
There is sufficient inducement in a steady job
at, say, £5 a week, with a choice of various
good climates, the best supply of elbow-room
on earth, liberal land laws, free education,
practical exemption of the poorer workers
from taxes, absolute control of the Govern-
ment by the people, and an equal chance to
rise to any office save that of Governor —
also in old-age pensions, invalid pensions,
baby bonus, free hospital treatment, religious
equality, and sundries. If it were not for the
lack of the reliable job the rush of “the best
class of labor” would be such that engineers
and watchmakers and shipbuilders would be
trodden underfoot, and carpet-makers would
faint in the press, and machinery construc-
tors would have to be rescued by the police
to save them from suffocation. Lacking the
job. all the other things are the apples of
Sodom and the lOU of Gomorrah. Smith
missed his point, not having sized un the
wonderful Job-Preventing Ministry and the
Job-Averting Parliament which made it.
THE ACCURSED CITY.
The unfortunate reappearance of the
drought draws attention once more to the
luckless Federal capital—the place that was
born with a curse on it. It is located in
the driest place which could be found in the
coastal or tableland district of N. S. Wales,
the adjacent meteorological stations of
Queanbeyan and Cooma having absolutely
the worst records over a long series of years.
Queanbeyan, the better of the two, has even
a worse record than eleven stations (Moree,
Warialda, Bingara, Narrabri, Gunnedah,
Coonabarabran, Quirindi, Dubbo, Young.
Murrumburrah and Albury) out of the 15
on the western slope from the mountains
down to the dry plains. The other place,
Cooma, is worse than all the 15 stations on
the western slope. It just beats Walgett,
on the Barwon, by a hair’s-breadth for
moisture. There is no adjacent river flow-
ing down from wet districts higher up, as
is the case at Dalgety. also a dry spot in
itself, for the capital site is practically at
the top of things thereabouts. The nearest
big river lies below it. The place is a
curious patch of drought and misfortune
which Nature, in a freakish mood, inserted
amid an area patch of comparative fertility.
And it was deliberately selected by a gang
of anti-Federalists and parish-minded scoun-
drels for that reason, they being aided by
the somnolence of people from other States,
who didn’t care because the capital couldn’t
bo in their State, they having been jockeyed
put of their chance by Reid and his friends,
and helped by people from their own State
who didn’t care when once they found that
their own electorates had no chance.
The essentials of the choice were obvious.
One was to secure a place which was so
near to Svdney that its trade, small as it
might be, and the expenditure of federal
money on the site would be for Sydney s
special benefit. Another was to secure a
place which had no chance of growing to
importance, its drought, its lack of coal,
iron, and water-power, and its position on
a by-road to nowhere in particular being
blessed disadvantages. A prosperous city
which might compare with Sydney even in
a moderate way was unthinkable. A pros-
perous city in the profits of which N. S.
Wales had only two-fifths’ interest, while
the other States had three-fifths, would have
made any old Freetrade and parish-pump
politician of the Sydney. Smith or Neild
or Hughes type leap in his grave and
make an unseemly disturbance in the ceme-
tery. The Sydney Telegraph, about the
most blushless organ of, everything that was
anti-Australian, said proudly that this
capital of a whole continent wpuld never be
more than “a large country town. ’ And
the Telegraph sort of people builded
better than they knew, for it isn’t even
that, though the born-dead and artificially-
gilded hamlet has already cost more than
the price of a decent country town. In
fact, the precautions were overdone. For
instance, this is the horrid and ridiculous
shape of the place:—
The bag-like or fish-like
part of the capital con-
sists of 900 square miles
of the driest land to be
found east of Albury. It
is situated in two coun-
ties which were already
giving up the ghost from
drought or other natural
causes —Cowley and Mur-
ray, both habitually on the
down-grade in the matter
of population. The snout represents a strip
of land 135 miles in length on which a
Federal railway is to be built, but as the
land on each side belongs to the State the
Federal Government will get no unearned
increment out of the job. The blob at the
end of the snout is the 28 square miles on
Jervis Bay, where the port of the Federal
city is to be, though regarded as a site for
a seaport town, with water-catchment area,
drainage outlet, wharves, etc., it looks
rather feeble. Nearly twice as much land
is required as a catchment for Sydney’s
Cataract dam.
* * * *
The charges made against the curiously-
shaped joke or swindle are various. Though
it has been the capital for nine years nobody
has gone there to use it as a capital, and
nobody intends to. The population is
diminishing, though highly-paid officials are
there in abundance to bolster up a popula-
tion. The railway—not the long snout-railway
which no one has had the courage to build
yet, 'but another one—is unique, inasmuch
as it pays no interest on its cost and less
than half its working expenses. This is a
curious record for a “metropolitan” railway.
The road made to the port is nicknamed
the Golden Road. It was built by day-
labor. and it is commonly said that the cost
equalled its area in sovereigns laid flat —it
would have cost more if they had been laid
sideways. About half the money was for
work done, and the other half to buy popu-
larity for dubious politicians. The bill for
losing population already amounts to over
£1,800,000. The last return showed the
revenue as £22,000. or about 9d. per acre
including land sales; and expenditure as
£105.000. And now the drought has fallen
on the nightmare-shaped place to add to its
other troubles. It might be better to cut the
loss and get a capital which isn’t in two
pieces with a string between them.
COALING A CRUISER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It has been said of the merchant service
that she is the handmaiden of the navy, and
with good reason, for without the dingy, bat-
tered tramps of the merchant service the
big grey battleships, to say nothing of the
smaller, but (in their own particular way)
no less important cruisers, scouts, T.B.D.'s
and submarines could not live, for they
depend on these dingy tramps for their very
life’s blood ; and the life’s blood of a fight-
ing ship is coal. Without coal (or in the
case of some of the later types of ships, oil)
the mightiest of these super-dreadnoughts
would be simply a helpless hulk unable to
proceed on its “lawful occasions,” and as a
mobile fighting machine would be useless.
If it is true that an army marches on its
stomach it is no less true that a modern
warship, squadron or fleet marches (or
steams) on its bunker supply, whether coal
or oil, and if the bunkers be empty the
usefulness of that ship, or fleet, has departed.
Therefore wherever a squadron of warships
is gathered together, to it will come the
tramps, wallowing out of all the coal-ports
of the world, loaded down to their scuppers,
and heaving their rustv sides out of the
water as they roll their rails under to a big
Atlantic swell, or burying themselves to
their bridges in solid water as they dive into
the mountainous seas of the South Pacific,
on their way to serve their mistress, the
Royal Navy.
Our old tramp steamer has some 2000
tons of coal to deliver to one of the big
cruisers, at a destination which we only
know after we have sailed from the loading
port and have opened our sealed orders. On
our arrival we find that she is already there
awaiting us. and as we draw up alongside
her we see that she is all ready to start
work as soon as we have tied up.
On the high forebridge the commander is
directing the operations of placing the
collier in the best position for working, and
his cleanly modulated but rather high-pitched
svoice conies flow a to us through a mega-
phone.

countless seamen.
But not the trim,
spick -and - span
men-’o’-warsmen we
are accustomed to seeing. Asa matter
of fact, they more resemble a horde
of pirates. They wear every kind of
rig except the one laid down for them by
my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty,
and each man has garbed himself as he
thinks fit. For coaling day on a warship is
the one day on which discipline is relaxed,
and on that day the men can wear what they
please. Therefore, there they are in almost
every kind of costume, several being in bath-
ing-suits only. The men rather look forward
to coaling ship, for, as I have said, the disci-
pline is to a certain extent relaxed, and on
this day they can smoke, talk, sing and
generally do as they like. There is, in fact,
only one small stipulation, and that is that
they must never stop working; for that is
the' one unforgivable crime on coaling day.
and Heaven help the man who is caught
slacking. Verily it were better for that man
that he had never been born. . The reason
that discipline is relaxed on this day is in
order to keep the men cheerful, for the work
is hard, and, once started, has to go through
at top speed to a finish, with very brief
intervals for meals.
Very soon everything is ready for starting
work, and the first-lieutenant, who is in
charge of the working party on the collier,
reports to the commander: “All ready on the
collier for coaling, sir.” “Carry on,” replies
the commander; and immediately coaling is
on. . , .
Practically everyone takes a part in this
“evolution,” officers as well as men, as it is
always the endeavor of every ship when
coaling to break the existing record of so
manv tons per hour, and the ship which can
establish a brand-new record for coaling
brings great honor and glory to the squadron
to which she belongs. Wherefore she has her
head nicely patted by the admiral in charge
of the station, and he in turn has his head
patted by my Lords of the'Admiralty when
in due course the new record reaches them.
And as it is devoutly believed in the Navy
that it is better to receive a pat on the head
from the admiral than to receive the pro-
mise of life everlasting, we see all the
executive officers, excepting the commander
(and, of course, the captain, who lives in
gloomy aloofness in his own sacred quarters
aft), and the officer of the day, hard at
work either driving winches and attending
hatches on the collier, or actually down in
the holds shovelling coal. Although the
commander does no actual work he, poor
man, has his time entirely occupied in super-
intending the labors of and acting as Lord
High Nigger-driver to some ,600 men. He
has eyes like a hawk for any slacking, and
seems to be everywhere at once; and if
things are not going entirely to his satisfac-
tion he points out the same to the delinquent
in language that is quite the reverse to what
you would expect from an officer in his
Majesty’s Navy. He notices one man who
in his opinion is ntot moving quite as
rapidly as he might.
“What the are you standing still
for?” he inquires caustically. “D’you think
this is a walking-match, or are you
just taking a little stroll? Move yourself
along a little smarter!”
And yet it seemed to us as though that
man was fairly flying. As one grimy, coal-
streaked able seaman remarked to a
friend: “ ‘The Bloke’ is orl right in ’is
way, ole son, but you’ve got to ’ave two
pairs o’ legs if you wants to get along wiv
’im.”
Which about sums the matter up cor-
rectly. Incidentally, the commander of a
British man-o’-war is ahvays irreverently
termed “The Bloke,” the first-lieutenant
being usually known as “Number One.” and
the captain (who is a very remote and
exalted person indeed, and not in any way
to be confused with the commander) is
generally termed “The Owner.” The cap-
tain of a man-o’-war lives a very solitary
life, as custom and naval discipline ordains
that he must keep entirely to himself, there-
fore he lives in solitary grandeur in his own
quarters in the stern, guarded always by a
sentry. He. of course, takes no part in the
coaling operations, but occasionally we see
him through the screen doors of the battery,
walking up and down the quarter-deck by
himself, a strangely lonely figure in the
midst of a hive of human industry.
The commander is attended everywhere
by one of the ship’s boys, who acts as his
messenger, and who never lets the comman-
der get out of his sight for a minute. His
duty is to be on hand at all times to take
any message the commander may require
to be sent, and he follows his superior about
wherever he goes.
It was a sixteen-year-old ship's boy, J. T.

An accurate tally is kept of the coal as it
is discharged, and every hour a signal is
made from the signal-yard showing the pro-
gress of the work. Thus, it we have 2000
tons to put out, and have discharged 1492
tons and in the last hour 210 tons, the
signal will read 210—508.. That is to say
210 tons for the last hour, and 508 tons still
to go out. As this signal is kept flying for a
full hour, until it is replaced by a fresh one,
everyone can see at a glance just how the
work stands, and if the work has fallen
below the usual standard for that ship an
effort is made during the next hour to catch
up on the time losi*. This hourly signal is
also eagerly read by every ship in the
squadron, and the record compared with her
own. The various sections of the ship s
companv are pitted against each other in a
spirit of friendly rivalry, the foretopmen
in one hatch trying to heat the maintopmen
in another, and so on. They still retain the
old terms of the wooden sailing-ships, such
as fore and maintop men, etc., for the pur-
poses of dividing the port and starboard
watches into sections.
Five o’clock in the afternoon brings a
welcome respite for 20 minutes whilst the
men go to tea, and then to work once again.
It is now dark, but electric-lamps are
strung everywhere, and under their glare the
hurrying, sweating men, seen through the
ever present cloud of coal-dust, combined
with the din, suggests a scene from Hell. In
the morning it will be “spit and polish” for
all hands until the ship again resumes her
normal smart appearance, but the rough of
it must be taken off before hammocks are
piped down.

The Black Death.
The Maorlland capital is only about 12
hours from Sydney by the air service,
vet the carefully-censored plague had been
raging in Auckland and Wellington for some
time before people on this side began to
learn what had really happened to these two
picturesque and usually light-hearted little
cities. Auckland had 1500 cases in a month
and the deaths numbered over 400. Wel-
lington, when it sent in a progress report at
the end of the first month, said that the
figures had not been made up, but that the
burials in Karori Cemetery numbered bjb.
In the most serious form of the disease 100
per cent, of the patients succumbed, and
that was the largest number that could
succumb. No disease, not even the Hun,
has yet been invented tln\t kills 101 per
cent On one notable day—the Day of
Panic—the deaths in Wellington hospitals
alone numbered 02. The deaths outside the
hospitals are still a dubious quantity. It
might not have been noticed much in Damas-
cus, for Damascus expects accidents like that,
but’ Maoriland isn’t accustomed to the experi-
ence The two stricken cities became dark
places where liquor bars, churches, schools,
shows of all sorts, barbers’ shops, many
other shops, wharves and factories closed up.
Everv sort of business that tended to bring
people together fell to pieces. People hated
to be brought together, and walked softly
round each other. One day, in a Govern-
ment department which usually employed
over 100 clerks, only two turned up. The
rest were dead or sick or impressed into the
sanitary service or burial service. For a
little while any sort of building became a
hospital, and any kind of truck became an
ambulance, and almost anything that was
hollow and long enough became a coffin. The
supply of doctors and nurses was insufficient
almost on the first swift demand, for the
absence of so many of both classes at the
war front had depleted their ranks. In the
•worst form of the disease death seems
practically certain; but medical and sani-
ty.,. science has advanced so much that
in a civilised country the epidemic does com-
paratively little damage except by a surprise
attack, and then the counter-attack comes
promptly. In the undrained, unwashed, un-
vcntilated ages, when inoculation was not
known, happenings of the Black Death
family, including calamities that were blue,
o- r een and blotched, also brown or striped
diseases, were so persistent that, despite a
hefty birth-rate. Britain’s population, for in-
stance. remained almost stationary for some
centuries. Yet Britain, being an island and far
removed from the great Asiatic breeding-
ground of trouble, was rather a fortunate
place. Some provinces further east had to
practically make a fresh start on occasions,
like the squatter west of the Darling at the
end of a seven years’ drought. That is to
say, they had to get some stud population
from adjacent localities which had stock to
spare.
o
The Long and the Short of It.
The case of Tasmanian Senator James
Long has an interest' all its own. Long’s
position, disregarding details in dispute and
not particularly important anyway, seems
to be this: He busied himself over the sale
of the Shaw wireless establishment to the
Commonwealth to the extent of (1) making
representations concerning the orders given
to the outfit and (2) subsequently drafting
the letter in which Father Shaw, who had
an option from the directors to purchase for
£25,000, offered to sell the concern for
£57.000, this being addressed to Hans
Jensen, then Labor Minister for the Navy.
Long made representations and gave Father
Shaw assistance in composition, because
(1) he had been returned to the Senate
pledged to a policy of nationalising industry,
and (2) he was a close friend of Shaw’s,
to whom he had lent certain small sums of
money and extended some personal hospi-
tality. On the day that £55,000 was lodged to
Siiaw’s credit at a Melbourne bank Shaw
drew out £5200 in notes of large denomina-
tion. It was Saturday morning, August
19, 1916. and Shaw, going up to the
Federal House of Parliament, discovered
Long, handed him a roll with the remark,
“Jim, I don’t know what I owe you, but
this ought to clear it.” and fled a minute
later. On counting the currency Long dis-
covered £1290. He took this to be a return
of money advanced (£300), and the remainder
(£990) to be a sort of mark of esteem or
sign of friendship. On September 4 Long
paid £2400 to credit of his banking account,
and his explanation is that this was made
up of Shaw’s £1290 and £lllO he won at
the races in the meantime (bookmakers he
won it from not being specified). Long
seems to have carried round a lot of money
in his pocket for a fortnight, but, of course,
that was his business. He repudiates any
suggestion of having received £1290 from
Father Shaw in return for “services” _ or
pulling a wire or working a deal, or anything
of that sort. Now without going beyond the
political aspect of this matter, it may reason-
ably be said that if any other member of
Parliament, elected on a policy of national-
isation or otherwise, is suddenly confronted
with a wad of £1290 from the person
who has parted with an industrial
concern to the nation, he should at once do
one of two things. Either he should sum-
mon a magistrate and secure from the
person with the affluence a sworn statement
of the why and the wherefore of the bestowal,
or, in the alternative, assume an air of
martyrdom and wave the scraps of paper
aside. And if he adopts the first of these
possible courses, he should not carry the dis-
tended donation about for a fortnight and
get it mixed up with copious winnings from
Ikey Mo. Long probably sees the reason-
ableness of this now. for it would have made
his position almost impregnable, so far as
open controversy may go. at any rate. But
whether he does or not is of minor signifi-
cance compared with the attitude of the
next politician who may get a hatful thrust
on him before having a big day at Fleming-
ton. Coming down to the bedrock of this
particular transaction, it seems that Long.
by oversight or casualness, has got himself
into a tight place, but that he possesses the
strongest possible reason for urging the
Federal Government to give him opportunity
to vindicate himself. He may be speaking
the truth when he says that he “cannot
overtake the impression” created by publi-
cation of the evidence regarding that £1290
and the £2400. Long knows best what he
can do. But a judicial pronouncement on
the facts would give him material help one
way or the other.

The Glory of Ulster.
“The magnificent achievements of Ulster
and the great deeds of Ulstermen” were the
theme of a celebration held recently in Syd-
ney. The occasion was the annual feed of
the Association, which stands for a part—
the imported section —of the population of a
small bit of the bit of Ireland above men-
tioned. The president added that it would
take a seraph (whatever that may be) speak-
ing in the brogue of Paradise (wherever
that may be) to do justice to the subject.
Getting down to details, he declared that the
United States bad had 27 presidents (none
of whom, by the way, barring Washington.
Lincoln and Grant were very outstanding
men, though Wilson is a highly-respectable
patriot carried forward by the flood of
events). Of these. 13 were of Ulster
descent. Also, he claimed in Australia and
Maoriland 31 governors, and the earth-
shaking genius of governors is proverbial;
some premiers and a heap of treasurers —
treasurers being the men who made the
deficits and the public debt. It may be all
more or less true, but what about it? If it
happened that the average age of a great
man’s parents was 25 years at the time when
they became parents, then he would have 510
ancestors in the last 200 years. It is diffi-
cult to avoid having one Ulsterman or
Ulsterwoman among them, for the province
is a coastal one. like Greece and Italy, and
coastal people are a roving lot who scatter
their progeny far and wide. The first essen-
tial is to select your ancestor and stick to
him and ignore all others. Thus one of the
most prominent among Australian men of
Ulster descent was really a Portuguese, if
his Portuguese ancestor had been picked out
and the others ignored. If the names of the
Ulsterman were given and anyone took the
trouble to investigate, it might be proved
that they came from all the world, including
Scotland. Venice, Greece and Tipperary. The
other essential, which is really the same one
over again, is to know when to put the plug
in the pedigree. If a man from, say, Scot-
land goes to Belfast he at once becomes an
Ulsterman. If his progeny move on to
America, they don’t become Americans for
purposes of argument, but remain Ulster-
men for ever. In fact, by a timely putting
in of the plug, it might be shown that half
the world’s great men came from Rome and
the Isle of Man. But even allowing for the
genius of Belfast men in getting sinecures as
governors, the fact remains that great men
may be a great nukance in the wrong place.
Hindenberg is doubtless a big man, but
because he was in the wrong place hanging
would be too good for him. The annoyance
about the crowd which calls itself “Ulster”
(though some people call' it differently
because it won’t heal up) is that it came
into a strange country, bringing with it a
strange language and a strange religion ; also
that it was planted there by an outside
Power as a privileged alien garrison, and
has posed as such at its annual dinner ever
since. A considerable area of land was con-
fiscated to make room for it (in fact, all
land held by Catholics was confiscated in
theory), and it brought “Kultur” with it,
also order and method and tidiness. The
old race was certainly very untidy—still it
claims that that wasn’t wholly its fault, as
at various times its language, literature,
manufactures, monetary system, schools,
universities, shipping, names, religion, mode
of hair-cut and most other things had been
prohibited in an effort to fit the people to a
uniform English pattern. That was once
the foolish idea of most big nations, includ-
ing Russians, Prussians, Austrians. Poles.
Magyars, Spaniards and others, so England
didn’t invent it. At present the old race
grumbles because the existence of the new
handful at tjie corner prevents it getting the
local self-government which even the paltry
Isle of Man (half-way between it and Eng-
land) and the Isle of Jersey enjoy. It wants
especially the right to make its own tariff
as in Australia and Newfoundland, for in a
land which is mostly devoid of coal and iron,
agriculture must be the standby. The
British Freetrade craze ruined agriculture
both in England and Ireland, but England
had illimitable mineral resources to fall back
on, while the other place hadn’t. And the
old race isn’t so impressed as it ought to
be by the boast of the man from the corner
that he has made Ireland so prosperous a
place that he rises to be as many as 31
nominee vice-regal figureheads by getting out
of it. Ireland has an equally good claim to pro-
fess that it supplied viceroys to Mexico and
Peru, a president and a crowd of able
generals to France, a marshal to Spain, a
premier to Austria —in fact, that it was a
world-provider of men who fought their way
up to some kind of conspicuousness instead
of having their peaceful lucrative jobs given
to them by royal favor. Still it is a point
of no importance. The Old Inhabitants in
Ireland wouldn’t object if every man of the
New Arrivals was made a governor so long
as his appointment was remote and per-
manent.
Capturing the Bench.
The One Big Union announces that when it
climbs into power there will be a new kind
of justice in Australia. This is how Secre-
tary Garden explains it: —
The committee is of opinion that the time has
arrived when working-class representation should be
granted on the judiciary. The opportunity has now
arisen. . . .for the appointment of one or more
workers to the Bench. We contend that they would
be more able to dispense justice by reason of their
early training than persons whose experience of life
has been limited purely to capitalistic environment.
It is hardly necessary to mention that the
"purely capitalistic environment” is either a
plain lie or childish twaddle. Men who start
life with a lot of capitalistic environment
generally aim at something more profitable
than a place on the bench. There are prizes
in the business, but still there is one State
Chief Justice who gets less than the salary
of a N. S. Wales Minister (Labor or other-
wise), and it takes long training and much
work to attain the 100 to 1 chance of a
judgeship. As for minor judges in the poorer
States, they are very small financial deer.
The men who climb to judicial office are all
sorts. Real, of Queensland, was an artisan.
Powers, of the High Court, and Mein, also
Queensland men. are generally understood to
have been solicitors’ clerks. Chief Jus-
tice Stout, of Maoriland, was a school-
teacher. Isaacs, of the High Court, started
from poverty. Dalley, who refused a
judgeship, had no assets in his early life
except a couple of parents. The origin of
Hughes and Holman, who can make them-
selves judges if they please, were not exactly
gilded. But men like Stout and Isaacs.
good democrats as they are, and humble as
their beginnings were, and despite their
great capacity and rigid honesty, are anathe-
ma to the One Big Union type because they
know the law which they administer —the
law that is made by the people, including the
One Big Union people. What is wanted is
the kind of Judge who doesn’t know the law.
but who will invent law as he goes along, and
save ignorant or stupid legislators the
trouble of doing the legislation they are paid
for. Thus the artisan who learned the. law
is utterly objectionable as a Judge, but if he
had been the same artisan who didn’t learn
anything except how to keep well in evidence
at the Trades Hall he would be wholly desir-
able. In the new lexicon of the Labor-
leaders there is only one proper road to afflu-
ence—by being a non-productive labor-
organiser, non-productive union secretary,
non-productive Labor member, non-produc-
tive Labor Minister, and finally, like
Andrew Fisher and others, a high-salaried
man with a more or less non-productive job.
Thus the One Big Union will keep the gate
to promotion. As for the man who takes
another road and produces things, he is liable
to be an employer, and as such is regarded
as a capitalist, even if he. has no capital, and
a public enemy to be suppressed. It is diffi-
cult to draft the Bill for his suppression:
even the Ryan Government in Queensland
hasn’t managed it. But the proposed new
kind of Judge might do a lot in that, direc-
tion without any Bill. Not being required to
know law, it would be the same to him
whether there was a law or not. It he began
to learn law. as Holman and HuottES did
he would probably be cast out of the pa
as they were, and thus become disqualified.
On the other hand, politicians Long and
Jensen would presumably be in the running,
likewise Mutch, even though he may not
work much, and John Storey. There are
great possibilities about the idea ot captur-
ing the Bench.
Hans Jensen’s Tumble.
In some respects it is quite a simple stoiy.
In others it is clouded by a great murki-
ness—up to the time of writing, at any. rate.
The yarn as told from the Navy Commission
runs this way :
In December, 1914, Father Shaw, formerly an R.C.
missionary in the Pacific, and latterly a wireless
specialist, offered to sell the land, plant and works
of the Shaw Wireless Co., Ltd., at Randwick (Syd-
ney), to the Postmaster-General’s Department. Shaw
then stated that the company had spent £78,000
on the outfit. On January 6, 1915, he definitely
crystallised the offer and fixed the price at £55,000.
On the advice of a committee of experts the Depart-
ment, on March 24, declined to buy. On May 16
Shaw, after informing one of the directors that he
had a good chance of selling to the company, secured
from the directors an option to purchase the com-
pany’s interests for £25,000. On the day he
obtained this option Shaw wrote to Jens Jensen,
then Minister for the Navy in the HUGHES-Tunon
Ministry, offering the concern for £57,000. The
letter to Jensen was drafted by Senator Jim Long,
of the Speck, who was (1) an intimate friend of
Shaw, and (2) anxious to see the works taken over
by the Government. At that time, also, Long was a
friend of Jensen. A fortnight later Jensen directed
the Naval Secretary to get a valuation as early as
possible. Rear-Admiral Ckksswkll next day minuted
the papers “Recommend the particulars be con-
sidered by the full Board.” They were not so con-
sidered. Engineer-Lieut. Crksswell, fleet wireless offi-
cer, reported on June 21 that he had made a prelimi-
nary inspection of the works and found them too
extensive to be taken over as wireless telegraphy
workshops. He expressed the opinion that they
should be taken over and organised as general engi-
neering shops. Rear-Admiral Clarkson minuted this
report with a disapproval of the engineer’s opinion.
On June 29 Cabinet approved Jensen’s recommenda-
tion to get a valuation. The next to happen was
that Shaw called on Ross, a Sydney engineer, to
whom he was a stranger, and asked him if he would
make a valuation as between the Federal Government
and the company. Ross agreed. He was appointed
by Jensen on July 14 -and his valuation of plant
was £46,496, which with the Home Affairs valua-
tion of land and buildings made £66,736. Ross’s
valuation appears to have been based on taking the
place as it stood as a commercial concern and in con-
cluding his report he said he thought £40,000 would
be a fair offer. There is then something about Com-
mander Crßsswbll having altered his report on this,
but the facts are not on the official papers. Cress-
well’s final report, anyhow, was one of approval,
though Cabinet did not know of his former attitude.
On August 4 Commonwealth Treasurer Higgs asked
for some replies to some adverse criticism of the
proposed purchase. Jensen supplied him with Cress-
well's favorable opinions, and added, “I am confi-
dent the Government has made a good deal.” The
business was then finalised and on August 19 £55,000
was paid to Shaw's credit at a Melbourne bank. On
that day Shaw operated heavily on the credit, pre-
sumably to discharge business obligations connected
with his £25,000 option. Also, he drew personally
£5200 in notes of large denomination. Of these the
destination of £1290 was established. Shaw handed
that much to Long —as a friendly gift, says Long. What
he did with the rest is unknown. There is some
evidence throwing direct suspicion. Shaw was
taken suddenly ill a day or two later and died
within a week. The £5200 had completely vanished.
The purchase was certainly a very calamitous one for
the Commonwealth.
There were obviously many features of the
business calling for extended explanation by
Jensen. Presumably he explained to
Cabinet; anyway, it is certain that Cabinet
decided it was undesirable for him to remain
a Minister, and when Hans Jensen declined
to quit his portfolio he was moved out. He
denies any wrongful act, and it is due to him
to say that there is nothing in the report of
the Commission to connect him with the
receipt of money. But there is quite a heap
of things in the report and the evidence to
suggest that his manner of administering his
department had been of a character to throw
grave doubts upon his fitness for the job.
Jensen’s claim that he has been “exoner-
ated from any corruption” is certainly no
reason why he should not have been fired.
Until he states his case more fully it is only
fair to assume that his refusal to get out
rests upon belief in his ability to establish
not merely his bona fides, but the absence of
justification for regarding him as a muddler.
If Jensen can do this, then he has been
badly treated. If he cannot —well, that’s
the end of the tale as far as he’s concerned.

The Despotism of Parliament.
“Trot” : From 1900 up till the eruption
“the restricted powers of the Common-
wealth” was a fairly useful subject to argue
about and an allegation mighty useful for
the politician to take cover behind. But
it is a moral certainty that if the Federal
arrangement on the present basis holds to-
gether—a very problematic happening—it
would be a hard job to get votes at
a referendum in favor of enlarging the
powers of the Commonwealth. The powers
most certainly ought to be extended in some
directions, but the hopelessness of secur-
ing popular assent to such a proceeding may
be a powerful influence in forcing accept-
ance rf the unification issue. The main
point of interest now, though, is that the
nowers of the Commonwealth appear along
certain lines to reach a point which can
hardly be guessed at. And as it is beyond
a doubt that there can be no such thing as
democratic government or fair liberty
until the powers of Parliaments are re-
stricted —advocacy of the initiative refer-
endum and recall is always an admission of
this —the position of the elector in relation
to the Commonwealth seems to want a lot
of clearing up. The War Precautions
Act, extended for another three months in
terms which ensure it prevailing until the
end of June, 1918, represents an invasion of
the people’s rights and liberties on a scale hav-
ing ho parallel outside the records of despots
and autocrats. Whether the invasion can

be justified does not matter. The facts are
" hat count. Now, before the war, no one
ever dreamed that the constitutional autho-
rity vested in the Federal Legislature “to
make laws for the peace, order and
good government of the Commonwealth with
respect to naval and military defence” gave
the Legislature power to do the things per-
petrated under this Act —one of which hap-
•pens t° be doing anything the Common-
wealth Ministry likes. Under this Act
habeas corpus is blacked out. The right
of meeting depends on official acquiescence.
Ihe right of speech is heavily restricted,
ihe right of criticism is in the freezer. By
the Act 1 arliament is gagged and the press
more or less throttled. Powers are taken by
a Ministry to do what generations of men
have fought to prevent—to do what cannot
be reconciled with the existence of democratic
institutions, alleged or otherwise. The re-
flection that it will all come to an end rests
on mere assumption. The interpretation
given to the Constitution by the High Court
when the War Precautions Act came up
tor review and the extension of the Act
beyond the period of war make it morally
ceitam that the Commonwealth legislature
under the specious claim of “Defence”
could go on passing such an Act as this
year after year. The dictum of the High
court was that the Minister alone was the
judge of what it was necessary to do to
ensure the naval and military defence of
the country. Positively nothing stands in
the way of Parliament at any time passing
a drag-net measure like this Act and giv-
ing Ministers the power not only to over-
ude the Constitution, but to abrogate stat-
ute law.

The I.W.W. Trials and Various Liars.
Justice Street, appointed to inquire into
the charges brought against the Sidney police
in connection with the I.WAV. trials (con-
commit arson), handed his report
to IN. S. Wales Parliament on Monday. The
inquiry was a long one; so, too, is the report,
•ind it seems to The Bulletin to be very
fair. The matters with which Street had
t'| deal attracted an extraordinary amount
of interest—not without reason. The pub-
lic had seen 12 men convicted in exceptional
circumstances of a serious offence and sen-
tenced to long terms of imprisonment. Then
u had heard of the two men on whose evidence
the ease against the prisoners mainly rested
making statements which suggested not only
the innocence of the accused, but a criminal
conspiracy among the police to secure convic-
tion by use of perjury. These were the state-
ments made by Scurry and Davis Gold-
stein. The essence of them was that Scurry
mid been promised £2OOO to procure evidence
to secure conviction; that Scurry was
ri?.?t : tv l d , T to P revent him divulging the facts ;
that Davis Gordstein had been asked by the
police to place “fire dope” in the pockets of
certain suspected I.W.W.’s; that the police
put the dope in one man's pockets; that the
entire case was a “frame up”; that the
death ot a Crown witness named McArriS-
ter was due to foul play to which police
officers were parties. Briefly, Justice Street
none of these allegations were
established ; that the people who made them
(that is, the recipients of Scurry's and
Cordstein s “confessions”) were misled by
lies. I urther, he comes to the obvious
conclusion that no “fresh facts” had been
placed before him to raise doubt about the
guilt of the convicted men. He does not
say they ore guilty or innocent. He is care-
■ s a Conrt n! £ ai 1 iament he did not sit
as a Couit of Leview, nor had he been asked
to express ah opinion on whether upon the

men were tried the bacon was in Sire peril.'
It is manifest that his Honor would not
hang a dog on the evidence of any one of
them. M hat this paper cannot refrain from
considering is what would the verdict be
to-morrow if the 12 men now in gaol were
placed in the dock and the Crown tendered
Scully and the Goldsteins as essential
witnesses against the accused? This is
altogether apart from the not-to-be-evaded
reflection that even as the case stood (with
Scully and the Goldsteins accepted as
reputable witnesses) there was always seri-
ous doubt aDout the justice of the finding in
relation to at least three of the accused men.

Another Disappointment.
There having been official denial of the
allegation that Defence-Minister Pearce was
last week trembling on the verge of depart-
ure for London it may be taken as reason-
ably certain that Pearce is to be detained
on the premises. The Bulletin is very
much afraid that in connection with this
matter of reinforcing Hughes and Cook
great weakness has been shown by Watt.
It would have cost a lot of money to send
Pearce abroad, but what would that have
mattered ? Watt’s desperate policy of keep-
mg 1 earce in Australia cannot be defended
on the ground of political or administrative
necessity, and still less upon the ground of
economy. Of course, it is possible that
Watt may have some scheme for grappling
with the situation created by the prevalence
of I earce, and for all this paper knows it
may be one of such boldness and originality
as to shed, lustre on the name of Watt He
may appoint him to the High Court or he
may think of declaring Pearce infected with
the flu and quarantining him until after peace
is declared. But either of these ridiculous
lines of action is fraught with the peril of
making Pearce a martyr. Meantime the
situation in London is growing daily more

“Going for the Gloves.”
A definite financial statement has been
made by the N. 8. Wales Premier. He says"

rise to £9,000,000 again as soon as that strain is
taken away.

manufacture well-paid billets abroad as a
refuge for politicians who suspect that they
or things in general are on their last feet.
Also there is hardly a day when three or
four portfolio-holders of the helter-skelter
variety are not abroad on “missions” at the
public expense and possibly considering new
fields of endeavor or investment against the
time when the old pasture will be exhausted.
A very active conviction seems to prevail

The Bolshevik and His Suspected
Brethren.
Mount Eli.iott, a very important copper-
mining centre of North Queensland, where
the I.WAV. rages at large and the Bol-
sheviks are in force, has closed up. The
trouble began ostensibly over the discharge
o. a solitary and somnolent employee who
was found in working hours busy at his
calling of being asleep. His reinstatement
was demanded and refused, whereupon local
industry was abandoned. The apparent atti-
tude of the employers was that if sleep was
allowed in working hours there was no limit
to the amount of somnolence that might take
place or to the accidents that might happen
in sleepmg-hours. Also that if the trouble
didn t happen over this matter it would
happen over another, trouble being due
m any case. Further, that, even if
no money, was involved they felt just as
the workers’ wives did in Lille during the
un occupation, when they had to smile
and bow whenever they met’a Hun—that is
to say, they felt annoyed or dragged in the
dust tor somebody’s amusement. Human
nature is like that. Many a man will be
philosophical over a loss of £3500, even if
lie can’t spare the money and has dropped it
through sharp practice, and yet will fight to

didn t care for the sleeper. But appa-
rently the order from the All-Highest people
or .c movement—those who must be obeyed
■—is that no opportunity is to be omitted to
slow-down industry, and thus multiply the
poor and discontented class who are the
cannon-fodder of revolution—revolution be-
ing the one thing which can elevate the
blatant talker to the position of a dictator
or temporary king. After all, the I.W.W.
people have plenty of precedents to go upon
lo quote only one. About 17 years ago there
was a specially strong desire to slow down
Australian manufacturing industry, not in
the interests of threadbare and gassy red-
naggers and apostles of the Brotherhood of
Alan, particularly German man, but in the
interests of well-dressed importers, who also
apostled the Brotherhood of Man—the cheap-
est foreign producer going for preference. The
importers crowd ran a go-slow strike or
stone-wall against the Tariff in the House of
Reps., and did it in the best go-slow fashion
or to-day. The object—the retarding or
destruction of local industry—was the same
and the methods weren’t widely different
The concentration of I.W.W. malevolence
on Australian industrialism as distinct from
importation would almost lend color to the
suspicion that the importing class is sup-
porting the present troubles. Against the
agent for foreign workshops run bv
cheap labor only one voice is continu-
ously raised—that of Higgs. And it is so
lonely that the pelican in the wilderness is
an overcrowded slum by comparison. The

a deputation to consider the representations

garme for export to be colored. The butter-
men said that Colored margarine was a
fraud, and did damage to the legitimate but-
ter business. If this is so, it is a prettv big
fraud, seeing that in 1915 the margarine
monufactured and imported into Britain
totalled £13,000,000 in value. At present
Britain imports her margarine from other
countries, and she imports it colored, while
Australia s trade in white has been neg-
ligible. Why must Australia refuse to

these huge populations want colored mar-

without any effort to make it worth more. If
Australia took and squeezed the oil out of
even one-half the copra produced in the
£ acinc Islands she would not ably boost the
islands and her trade with them," but would
oil enough to do its share in making

"P.X.”: There probably never before was
such a gang as the one that coaled the
Makura at Auckland, and took four-hour
shifts in the stokehole: to bring her on to Syd-
ney. When the ship reached Vancouver she
wasn t, to say the least of it, over-manned ;
and having had something aboard that was
alleged to be ’flu’, terribly-scared Vancouver
refused to All any vacancies. In fact, it
refused for a time to even come aboard with
coal. This meant « long delay in starting
and subsequent slow plodding across the
1 acinc; and as one after another of the
crew dropped out the position aboard got no
better. Suva shooed the vessel off- and
Auckland did worse—it put her into quaran-
tine and kept the passengers aboard for a
week, and by the end of that time the engine
am! stokehole staff was down near zero. It

off their khaki and turned to—General
Brand, three or four colonels and a score of
majors among them. Then, pretty suddenly
something else happened. The too-few stew-
ards, tired of seeing the crew shot into the
quarantine-station when they felt sick while
the passengers were kept aboard, decided to
knock off work; and that sent a few editors
and sundries into the dish-washing and wait-

Muriel Starr wound up her season at the
Criterion (Sydney) this week in Within
the Law ” one of her earliest and one of her
best parts. It had been a long season of
hill’d work and at the end even the actress s
voice began to issue signs of wear. In this
play Norma Mitchell had a part in which she
sc'cmod to 1)6 more fond of tliciii tiny otnei
and during the week Agnes Lynch was a
more joyous circumstance than before. In-
spector Burke, of the rxew York Police, was
the same astounding apparition. On Satur-
day Adams and Waters appear again, but
having discarded the aliases of Potash and
Perlmutter, they will on this occasion be
“Friendly Enemies.” This is a war propa-
ganda play straight from U.S.
The theatre signalman in the J.C.W. box
has altered the show dates slightly during
the week. “Oh. Oh, Delphine !” is to open
in the Royal (Sydney) on Monday, Decem-
ber 23. Her Majesty’s will then take a few
days off to absorb “Hello. Everybody!” with
its' masses of scenery. The big revue (crew
of 300) begins its Sydney season with a
matinee on Boxing Day.
There was a foil house at the Palace
(Sydney) when the J. and N. Tait Reper-
tory co. played Shaw’s “The Doctor’s Dilem-
ma'” for the first time to a regular night
audience. Fine as the matinee performances
were, Saturday’s show went one better. The
spirit of the work caught the audience early,
and again and again the house rocked with
laughter. Not a point was missed, not. a
word failed to win its full value of apprecia-
tion; and the movement of the play was fol-
lowed with keen interest to the last curtain.
Under such stimulus the actors naturally did
their best. The part of Mr. Cutler Walpole
was taken by Gregan McMahon, who con-
trived to make a notable character-study of
the popular surgeon. His slogan of “blood-
poisoning” was a good second to Eardley
Turner’s war-cry, “Stimulate the phago-
cytes.” All the other parts were cast. as
before, but everywhere there was more spirit
and vim observable in the acting. Cecil
Brooking, in particular, held the house, with
his Dr. Blenkinsop. To-morrow (Friday)
begins a short season of four nights of John
Galsworthy’s “The Pigeon,” with Shaw’s
clever rough-and-tumble, “How He Lied to
Her Husband,” as a curtain-raiser.

“Everybody’s Doing It,” at the Tivoli
(Sydney) rolls along towards Christmas.
Seme of its brightest patches are due to
Lottie Sargent’s comedy work. She hits a
topnote as the inane maid in “Watch Your
Wife,” a slight but smart thing in which
Florence Fox plays the wife who hides the
nervous intruder (Hugh Huntley) under the
table. C. 11. Workman makes a success of
the calm, cynical husband who gives no
sign when he observes the intruder’s boots
or hears him breathing hard through his
nose. There’s a good laugh in the climax.
Mabel Normand has come back with a
flourish to film-land. This week Crystal
Palace and Strand (Sydney) are bulging
from the press of her old admirers, watching
her in the name-part of “Mickey.” All the
usual thrills are embodied in this picture
with a few new ones, which culminate when
Mickey comes a cropper in a race scene and
brings the field down with her. The ex-Syd-
ney girl Sylvia Bremer is playing lead on
a screen at Hoyt’s. The play is entitled
“Missing,” adapted from the novel by Mrs.
Ward. The story is sodden with sentiment.
At Hoyt’s and the Haymarliet “The Guilty
Man” is denouncing himself with great vigor
and dramatic force. Maxine Elliott’s well-
advertised beauty improves the “Fighting
Odds” at the Lyceum and a very weak story
is grateful for her assistance.
A first trial lias been given before a big
audience at the Tivoli (Adelaide) of a
tliree-act comedy by
Miss Edith Aird, a
clever local press-
woman, who is mak-
ing a study of original
farcical comedy. This
is her second produc-
tion. “Behind a Pet-
ticoat” is a tale of
London in war-time,
with an Australian
flavoring. The Profes-
sor’s wife wanted him
to dodge conscription
because of liis sup-
posed unwarlike dis-
position. He eventu-
ally adopts skirts,
consoling himself
with the thought that
thereby he has a bet-
ter chance to watch
German spies. Of
course he succeeds in
unmasking them, and
of course his wife be-
comes jealous of his
close relations with
the ladies at his
boarding-house. (In
fact, the most irre-
proachable among
them were hiding
under his bed towards
the end.) Victor Fitz-
herbert played a sol-
dier, and the rest of
the cast were skilled
a m ateurs Reg
Sabine, the professor;
Zoe Reid, the wife;
and the author and
“Oh, Oh, Delphine!"
at Sydney Majesty's.
Leslie Holland as
Colonel Bonnet.
Dorothy Connor the boarding-house irre-
proachables. Herbert Walsh staged the
play, which brought in a large sum for
the' French Red Cross. 11. D. Mclntosh is
said to have offered to give it a full profes-
sional trial.
“The Sentimental Bloke,”
which was filmed in Sydney
by the Southern Cross Co.
of S.A., had its first screen-
ing before an invited audi-
ence at the Wondergraph
(Adelaide) recently. Den-
nis, who was present with a
vice-regal party, expressed
himself as much pleased.
Arthur Tauchert, though a
trifle on the mature side, is
simply It as the hard-faced,
soft-hearted Bloke. Lottie
Lyell is affectionate and
rather “superior” as the tart
from the pickle-factory,, and
the support is good. The
story is told entirely in the
words of the poem, and the
scraps of philosophy acquire
a fresh value on the screen.
The photographing has been
well done. Even the “Romeo
and Juliet” scenes are given,
with Bill in the gallery bar-
racking against Tybalt and
exhorting Romeo to “Put in
the boot.”
Other Adelaide shows are:
“Business Before Pleasure”
—amusing but rather spun-
out—at the Royal (Maggie
Moore’s sneer is worth the
price of admission) ; Gloria
Swanson and Constance
Talmadge at West’s; Mary Pickford
dangling over the heads of furious aunts
in a home-made circus at Wondergraph ; and
“the only living rival of C. Chaplin” (Toto
is his name) at the Pav. The Majestic
has a good mixed bill, with the illusive Lain-
pinis, the musical Alsace and the soprano
Veronica. The Scarlet Gaieties are in the
open air at the Exhibition, and Pierrot Pie
is about to be opened on the other side of
North Terrace.
“Hello, Every-
body !” quitted Her
Majesty’s (Melb.)
last Saturday
night. At present
the big theatre is
closed, but the fev-
erish heat of ham-
mers, the continu-
ous shuffle of feet,
not to mention cer-
tain preliminary
snorts on the trom-
bone, all warrant
the suspicion that
preparations are in
hand for the ap-
pearance of “Goody
Two Shoes” on
Saturday night.
This year’s “pan-
tomime extravagan-
za” is described
as “tremendous,”
though that adjec-
tive hardly repre-
sents the feelings
of the management
on the matter.
Apparently the
word has been used
this time because
all the other super-
latives i n the
Firm’s employ have
lately been com-
plaining of over-
work, and have
had to be put aside
for a spell.
At the King’s
(Melb.) the Taits,
“Oh, Oh, Delpkine!”
at Sydney Majesty's.
Reginald Roberts
as artist Jolibeau.
allied with Bailey and Grant, are getting their
panto of “Jack and Jill” into shape for the
opening on Saturday. In a long and tumul-
tuous foreword this great disturbance pro-
mises to be “a gorgeous Christmas banquet
of splendors, proffered with joy-exulting
songs and frolicsome glee, that will warm
the blood and fill the mind with sunshine.”
It is understood that more of this sort of
eulogy will be available for quotation as
soon as the management has made the neces-
sary repairs to the dictionary.
*
A change is also promised at the Tivoli
(Melb.) on Saturday, when “Iloni Soit”
will retire in favor of a now attraction,
“Bubbly,” which is understood to convey a
high pitch of effervescence or a state of
frivolity bordering on lunacy, or something
like that.
Alberto Zelman’s Symphony Orchestra
played on behalf of the Red Triangle appeal
at the Town Hall (Melb.) on Saturday night.
The programme opened with Dvorak’s Sym-
phony No. 7 in E minor, and the
band gave a confident and tasteful
illustration of the score. Excerpts from
Tschaikowsky’s “Nutcracker Suite” caused
the intervention of the celeste in the Dance
of the Sugarplum Fairy, whilst the flutes
gaily flaunted the dexterities of the Ileedpipe
Dance and the harp had a capital solo in the
Flower Waltz. The full band amplified the
fantasy and the laughter of the music in
some lively passages, and some of the tinkli-
est bits were generously encored. But the
best performance of the evening was the
familiar Death of Asa from Grieg’s “Peer
Gynt Suite,” followed by the dance in which
Anitra beholds Gynt, and suddenly seems to
require a dose of cooling medicine. The begin-
ning of the final disturbance, the Prelude to
“Lohengrin/’ extended the mostly feminine
fiddlers to the full limit of their bow arms.
The introduction to the third act of the same
opera irretrievably fractured the public peace,
all hands co-operating to the beat of the
anguished baton and producing a sumptuous
Wagnerian din. Mrs. Alberto Zelman was
the solitary songstress in two or three recita-
tives and arias from “Figaro” and “Otello,”
and she warbled them in the comfortable,
uninspired manner of one whose youthful
rapture had succumbed to a matronly calm-
ness.
** * *
The “Hearts of the World” film continues
to unroll its marvels at the Theatre Royal
(Melb.). Twice a day the Boy goes out to
meet the Hun. what time the Girl has to
suspend her ladylike inertia and cart dirt
and drudge generally for the same incon-
siderate animal. There are little gentleness
and gentility about the average exponent of
frightfulness, and the movie’s relentless reci-
tal of his deeds reminds us to keep our
enmity intact until we have made the ruffian
safe for democracy.
Connoisseurs of cowbov frightfulness ought
to add Tom Mix to their collection. That
tremendous rustler is circulating at Hoyt’s
Lyceum (Melb.) in all his fatal beauty in
“Ace High,” and when he gets vexed a
lead shortage is imminent. \ ivian Martin,
in “Molly Entangled,’’ is Mix’s nearest
neighbor, and Vivian’s idea of a colleen in
a romantic Irish setting gives a surplus ot
sugar to the show. At Hoyt’s, too, Vivian
Reed and Gloria Hope, in “The Guilty
Man,’’ share the screen with two kid actors,
Francis Carpenter and Virginia Lee Corbin,
in a Fox version of Aladdin and the Wonder-
ful Lamp. The Britannia on Monday re-
peated the sly farce of “Good Night, Paul,’'
wherein Constance Talmadge is in the lead.
To-day the Britannia promises that Alice
Joyce will be handed over “To the Highest
Bidder.’’ At the Melba on Monday a small
girl was making Wall-street nervous in a
Bluebird thriller entitled “Danger Within.”
From to-day until Saturday Gladys Leslie
in “Wild Primrose” will allure the usual
drove of shortsighted men.
Another Melbourne side-show :
Jack Sommers’s little souvenirs of battle at the Arts
anci Crafts Society, Melbourne, will awaken memories
in every digger. They are mostly small sketches
of minor events, but their habit of picturing an
incident at its maximum of dramatic interest sug-
gests that the artist has the eye of a kodak. He
has caught and preserved snapshots of trouble in
Palestine, Egypt and France, and also hangs some
impressions of naval gunfire on the Gallipoli Penin-
sula. Some of his sketches are reminders of forgot-
ten developments, as, for instance, his view of
the armored cars hurrying over the desort to annoy
the Senussi. Others arc in the nature of decorative
post-mortems, as witness the curious study of dead
horses in “After the Charge.” Elsewhere you get
more varieties of disturbance —a damaged Zep drop-
ping to earth like a discarded cigar or a “kharn-
seen” blowing a camp to rubbish—and you feel that
the work is the “dinkum oil” untouched by the
super-realisms of the “special correspondent.” Some
peaceful bits of Cairo and the Nile are introduced
into the record of war, and there is a big Australian
sea-piece, “Breakers,” which brilliantly realises the
impact of sudden sunlight on heaving water.
Back from France after four years, with
the Motor Transport Service, Major Wyn-
yard Joss, a Maorilander for many years
resident in Queensland, lie sailed to the
wars with the first convoy in 1014. During
the Boer War he did a year in South Africa
with the sth Q. 1.8. lie is a motor expert.
Langdon Bonython, who has an enormous
income from Adelaide Advertiser, of which
lie is sole proprietor, has made a handsome
gift of £5OOO to the local School of Mines
for the erection of a thoroughly up-to-date
high school in connection with it. To do
the thing fully will cost more than that, but
Bonython. who has been president of the
School of Mines for nearly 30 years, makes it
a condition of his gift that the S.A. Govern-
ment shall find the balance.
It was stated in The Bulletin (5/12/T8)
that certain returned soldiers, temporary em-
ployees of the Commonwealth Government,
having attended a competitive examination
for a permanent position in the service, had
had their pay docked for the period of their
absence from duty. Tiie Bulletin has
received a letter from the Prime Minister’s
Department, complaining that the allegation
is “incorrect” and stating that “instructions
were given to all departments on November
21 that returned soldiers temporarily em-
ployed in the Commonwealth who were can-
didates at the examination in question
should be granted leave on full pay.” This
paper, on further inquiry, learns that the
actual procession of events in this little
affair was as follows: (1) The exam, was
held on the 14th-16th November. (2) The
men were later informed by departmental
officials that they would not be paid for the
days they were absent at the examination.
(3) They immediately raised a bitter howl
of protest. (4) The matter was then referred
to the Acting-Prime Minister, who did the
fair thing, and the order for payment was
made. Red Tape is entirely welcome to the
admission by this paper that the men were
paid after all.
The fourteenth issue of Australia To-Day, the
annual produced by the United Commercial Travel-
lers’ Association of Australasia, just published,
maintains the same high standard as in previous
years. The full-page colored supplement, a fine
specimen of the engravers’ art, reproduces a charac-
teristic oil-painting by the well-known Dutch-Aus-
tralian artist, J. H. Scheltema. The colored cover,
with its prophetic design of Civilisation crowning an
Anzac with the laurels of victory, is by Norman
Lindsay, who also decorates in an exceptionally
impressive way Archibald Strong’s powerful opening
poem, “The Southern Cross.” The general contents
comprise articles by foremost Australian experts in
their respective lines, and cover a wide range of
topics. The publication is lavishly illustrated.

instead of every six months, so the table
heading these remarks lias been re-cast to
show the figures for the full 1- months to

Six-o’clock closing is not alone responsible
for that slide in profits. In view of the
restricted trading hours and the loss or cus-
tom by Billjim’s absence, the decrease in the
quantity of ale, beer and stout manufactured
in N. S. Wales is not as big as might be
expected: 1913, 24,212,000 gallons; 19M-15,
24,434,000 gallons; 1915-10. 23.899,000 gal-
lons; 1916-17, 22,486,000 gallons. Costs all
round have, however, increased considerably ;
but the price to the consumer has apparently
not been raised to the same extent. The pro-
fit on brewings, rents and interest, etc.(alter
deducting an unspecified amount for depre-
ciation in each case), are-now 20 p.c. less
than they were four years ago; on the other
hand, management exes., wages, excise, taxes,
etc., have decreased only slightly over 2 p.c.
It is clear that the clipping off of 30 of
Bung’s best trading hours each week has
not worked out so disastrously for the, brew-
eries as the no-liquor crowd anticipated.
Partly as a set-off against the loss of trade
by six o’clock-closing has been the Common-
wealth Government’s method of paying for
our share of the war chiefly with a
p.n. It was estimated that at least 90
millions of War Loan money had been spent
in the Commonwealth when Tooth's made up
their last balance-sheet. The big cities have
benefited chiefly by this expenditure, and
there’s nothing like a loan boom to keep the
beer-pumps busy. In addition, Tooth’s early
in the year installed a lager-beer plant, “with
a success which has far exceeded expecta-
tions” ; and this new brew has, of course,
helped to maintain the co.’s output.
Tooth and Co. had a gorgeous time prior
to the war. Go back 10 years:—

Capital in 190 S was £900.000. and during
the next six years no less than £887,500 of
reserves were capitalised (£295195 coming
from the writing-up of assets). The zenith
of the co.’s wonderful record was reached in
1914, when 10 p.c, was paid on the whole of
the greatly increased capital. The position
has changed since then, nnd for the past
three years the net profits have totalled only
£449,149 compared with £745,302 for the
three previous years. The result has been
that the div. on the ordinary shares has
dropped a point while the prefs. have been
reduced to their minimum of 0 p.o. To what
extent internal reserves have been built up
recently The Bulletin has no idea; but
clearly "with the altered conditions and with
even "the present rate of divs. absorbing over
£39 000 more than the 10 p.c. distribution
required only six years ago, the opportuni-
ties for stuffing away undisclosed profits are
not by any means as favorable as formerly.
And the future is quite uncertain. The no-
liquor people are still very active. 1 hough
it is unlikely on present indications that
the Australian will vote himself dry, it:
seems certain that restrictions and supei-
vision of the Trade will become more strin-
gent The nationalisation of the entire
liquor traffic is even a possibility of the
future. The continuance of six-o clock
closing, at any rate, can be practically
guaranteed. If present conditions con-
tinue, Tooth’s will still be in a posi-
tion to make good profits; but what is
more certain is that the future will not be
so fat for shareholders as the past has been.
What the investor thinks of the matter may
be judged from the fact that whereas 445.
was asked for the co.’s £1 ords., and 335. 6d.
for the £1 prefs., in September, 1914, buyers
were paying 235. and 19s. 9d. respectively
in September last.

This co is chiefly interested in agricultural
machinery, and from its recent history can
be got some idea as to how Cocky has been
faring. When crops and markets are favor-
able. there’s a rush to get the latest in
ploughs, harvesters, and so on. But tne
wheat position during the past couple ol
seasons has been very unsatisfactory. It is
not many years since the popular cry was.
“Go on 'the land, young man. And the
young man who went on the land has in
many cases come to the conclusion that
under recent conditions there’s very little in
wheat-farming except hard work. Late
years have been full of trouble; and one
result has been a big reduction m the area
cultivated.
Under these unfavorable conditions it is
not surprising to find that James Martin and
Co has had a poor year. Gross pioht on

entirely on the seasons and the wheat
market, though if the various Government
schemes to rush tens of thousands of re-
turned Billjims on to the land are proceeded
with, no doubt Martin’s will get its share
of providing the necessary implements. But
there is certain to be a proportion of failures
among the soldier-settlers, and the manage-
ment will probably have to keep a close eye
on the t.p. side of its business.

The growth of trust funds administered by
this co. shows how popular the trustee co.
has become in South Australia. In 1900,
when this concern had been in business 20
years, trusts in hand amounted to £654,0ut).
During the next IS years to June last the
figures had increased to £3,629,002, and
during the past three months another
£200,000 odd has been given into the co.'s
care. So now, after 18 years, the co. is
administrating practically six times the
business it had in hand at the end of its
20th year, despite the fact that another co.
came into the field some years ago. Pro-
bably some of the expansion lately has been
due to an increase in capital values; but
that does not make the record less credit-
able. Owing to high interest earnings and
the new business coming in, the co.’s commis-
sion earnings have shown considerable in-
creases during the past few years. Here

Commission earnings come chiefly from (1)
an initial charge of 2£ p.c. on the gross value
of an estate up to £5OOO, with smaller
charges for amounts in excess of £5OOO, and
(2) 5 p.c. on annual income collected up to
£lOOO, diminishing to 24 p.c. on any income
collected above £3OOO. But not only does a
trustee co. do its work cheaply, it also gives
the client the benefit of the advice of
experts who have made trustee business
their life’s work. Further, unlike the
private trustee, it is permanent, and its
future depends on maintaining efficiency.
More than that, it also - guarantees good
behavior in the matter of handling clients’
funds. In this case, for instance, there are
£69.728 of shareholders’ funds and a further
£54,425 capital callable to protect clients.
As for shareholders, the position is very
comfortable. The profits for the past year
were equal to over 33 p.c. of the paid capi-
tal., and though it is not unlikely that the
earnings will not be so handsome during the
next few years, conditions would have to be
very bad indeed if the 10 p.c. could not be
maintained. The co. at September 30 did
not owe a single penny, and shareholders’
funds were made up in this way: Govern-
ment securities and cash, £40.665; freeholds
and leaseholds, £18,001: advances to estates,
£9664; mortgages, £3410; furniture, etc.,
£720: while £2571 has been invested in a
safe deposit which returned a net profit of 6
p.c. for the past year.

Reserves are made up in this way:—Con-
tingency reserve. £31.549; general reserve
fund, £19.869; P. and L. balance, £649. In
the nineties it used to be the Newcastle
Permanent Investment and Building Co..
but after the smash, when the management
discovered it had a heap of inflated securi-
ties thrown on its hands, it restarted life
without the “Permanent.” Unlike most
other cos. this one did not write down its
assets to cover losses; instead it wrote off
portion of the capital and transferred it to
a contingency fund. Any losses incurred as
properties were unloaded have been
charged against this reserve. Twenty
years ago foreclosures totalled about
£llO.OOO. and the contingency fund stood
at £48.011; at August 31 last pro-
perties in possession had a book value of
£26,083, but after meeting the losses on 20
years of realisations the contingency had been
reduced to only £31.549 ; so the sale of the old
wreckage has not turned out so badly as
was anticipated. Here is a comparison of
other balance-sheet figures :
Liabilities.
1900. 1910. 1915. 1917. 1918.
Deposits . .£17,610 £30,170 £62,896 £70,424 £72,034

Liquid assets 18,739 2,369 889 11,871 13,402
The co. has been steadily increasing its
advances despite recent uncertain conditions.
However. Newcastle is going ahead in leaps
and bounds, and undoubtedly has a great
industrial future. The Broken Hill 1 ro-
prietary has put over 2f millions into its
steel works there; the Commonwealth Steel
Products Co. is preparing to spend a quar-
ter of a million on plant; and other cos.
are establishing themselves in the Coal
City. All this expenditure, of course, is
going to help the Newcastle Building and
Investment Co.
To finance its business the co. is depend-
ing on £72,034 of depositors' money, while
it owes £l6OO to sundry creditors, etc. To
meet these liabilities the co. has liquid
assets amounting to £13.402, property with
a book value of £81.058 and advances total-
ling £136,454. The depositors are thus well
protected; for even were the value of the
properties and advances to slump to one-
third of their present figure all liabilities to
the public would be fully covered. _ Cer-
tainly only less than 19 p.c. of the liabilities
art 1 in more or less liquid form; but the
security is certainly there.
* * * *
The Solomon Islands Rubber Planta-
tions, Ltd.: —Though this is a “rubber
plantations” concern, the co. is not worrying
about that product just now, but is chiefly
interested in cocoanuts. The estate consists
of about 14,000 acres of freehold, and was
taken over from Captain Svensen in 1910.
At the end of the co’s first year 255 acres
had been planted with cocoanuts and 112
acres were under rubber, planted two to
three years previously. The bottom having
dropped out of the rubber boom, no tapping
has been done since 1914. The cocoanut
area has been gradually extended, and at
July 31 931 acres had been planted. Alto-
gether there were 51,208 trees, but no less
than 41,758 had still to come into bearing,
while of those in bearing a third were
merely in the early stages. However, the
copra vield is increasing rapidly: 1916.
69,0231 b.; 1917, 117,3761 b.; 1918, 161,4051 b.
But the market last year was disappointing,
and shipping difficulties added to the co.'s
troubles. The trading profit for the year
was £lOl6. but of that interest absorbed
£526, Brisbane office exes. £209, and the
remainder (£281) went towards renewals,
replacements, etc.
All the new development work has fyeen
expensive, and a further £2OOO was spent
last year. Finance has not been easy. The
whole of the capital of £58,647 and t an
£BOOO mortgage (due 1925) have been swal-
lowed up by development exes, and plant.
At July 31 there was only £1353 of capital
uncalled, and the co. was leaning on . the
bank to the extent of £1093, while £951 was
due to sundry creditors. More or less
liquid assets amounted to £2071 —which
just, covered the bank overdraft and sun-
dry creditors. Something had to be done,
of course; so the recent meeting /if share-
holders agreed to the issue of 12,000 £1
prefs. The future depends entirely on the
copra market. If good prices rule, with
luck this co. should be in a position to do
well; but there is still a long wait before a
hie proportion of the trees come into bear-
ing.

This little co. holds no deposits; it works
almost entirely on its own capital (£10,432),
and its liabilities amount to only £260. Con-
sequently while risks are small, so also are
profits. Loans outstanding four years ago
amounted to £12,282; at September 30 last
they were £11,097. So the co. has been doing
very little new business; though any new
loans put on the books as the old balances
have been got in should be earning
more than the old advances. Still the figures
do not show much improvement: in 1914 the
interest return was 7.6 p.c., and for the past
year 7.9 p.c. The co.’s balance-sheet figures

Patches show in the dredging work done at
Adelong (N.S.W.) by both the Estates and
the Creek cos. The last-named paid 2s.
dividends in .1917, and has been scraping
along on a hard bottom almost ever since.
The Estates’ No. 1 plant, which opened out
in October, T 4, in 4d. ground, worked up to
S.Gd. dirt in 1910, and then got into a run
of 21d. wash. A year was occupied battling
through that waste; but since then yields
have panned out at about 7d. per cubic yard.
No. 2 plant did good work all the while on
an average grade of 9d., and at one time
was in I3id. dirt. These two Estates’
plants have provided £41,250 in divs. on a
paid-up capital of £85,125. Dredging to-day
isn’t what it was in pre-war times. Last
half-year saw No. 2 dredge in the repairers’
hands, so the net profit was only £4489.
Ahead of this plant is lower-grade dirt.
However, manager W. George isn’t dis-
mayed, for he intends to cut expenses by
putting through a bigger yardage. Bores in
front of No. 1 plant give good prospects, so
the balance may be kept up by its efforts.
George got No. 1 working costs down to
3.7 d., and those of No. 2 to S.Olld. per cubic
yard.

Great Britain Sluicing Co., Emmaville
(N.S.W.), sold its tin oxide a’ £256 10s. per
ton during the past half-year, and from 63
tons made a profit of £5450. Includ-
ing the £BB6 brought forward, the directors
had £6336 to deal with, and shareholders
received £6OOO in divs. The balance
was transferred to reserves, which now total
£5400. Twenty acres have been purchased
on Y. Creek, which will add two years to
the life of the co.
Manager Atkinson, of the Vegetable Creek
(N.S.W.), comes forward with an oppor-
tune statement regarding reserves. He has
hitherto been very conservative and cautious
in estimating reserves, so his statement that
there are approximately 3QO tons of tin
oxide blocked out or partially developed is
comforting. The market valuation at Bs. a
share is £140,000, and though 300 tons black
tin are not worth anything like £140.000, it
is probable that more payable wash-dirt will
be opened up.

George Swinburne, lately resigned from
the Inter-State Commission, is dipping into
the fleshpots of high finance once again. He
rejoins Bowes Kelly, William Jamieson, Colin
Templeton and Holmes Hunt at the Mt.
Lyell Board table, filling Lindsay Tullock’s
place. Attached is a seat on the Mt. Read
and Rosebery directorate, and maybe one on
the Electrolytic Zinc, for someone has been
pulling strings to arrange that that pup of
the Amalgamated Zinc shall handle the
Read-Rosebery ores at Itisdon. Chairman
Kelly, when handing out the news concern-
ing the Electrolytic Zinc, scotched discussion
by saying that he didn’t think any good
object “would be served by discussing issues
here.” The humor lies in the fact that a
full year will have passed before share-
holders meet again. By that time the
deed may be done and the agreement signed.
A subtle stroke for the Amalgamated Zinc
if the deal comes off, for it will mark the
annexation to it of the last block of mines
outside Collins House influence. Once again
brains tell.
That child of fortune, Tonglcah Harbor
("Siam), comes to light with a wonderful
year’s record :

This is the same old show that tinned the
Hobart jam crowd, and, incidentally, Cap’n
Males, so effectively. The broker who offered
to sell Tongkah Harbor divs. for 4s. a share
after Currie and Wharton’s inspection would
have had to part up £435,000 in divs.
What a record! Out of a condemned
claim has been got 11,081 tons tin ore, sold
for £1,247,808, and the mine still going
strong. War prices of the white metal
. almost doubled profits in the last four years.
The tip is that the rate will fall to £2OO per
ton. Even that would mean splendid profit
earning for Tongkah, though it would not pro-
vide the 40 p.c. div. rate of last year. With
only £6376 of liabilities and £106,748 of gilt-
edged assets the co. enters its new year with
great confidence. The next field of attack
is to be the deep section of Puket Sound.
There a big dredger is to be placed at work
and paid for out of the cash balance. The
inducement is the record yield of 549 tons
oxide won out in the harbor by No. 6 dredge.
Plainly the rich run of tin, instead of tailing
off in the deep water, has kept its value and
wddth, thereby giving fresh life to the co.
Most dredges provide lower returns than the
bores, but at Tongkah Harbor experience in
this respect has been a series of pleasurable
surprises. Still, there is a snake in the
grass. This is the wily little Siamese who
collects his bit out of the war profits. The
way he does it is an example to hard-up
Treasurers, for he levies a progressive ex-
port duty on tin. This starts at 10 p.c. and
increases to 25 p.c. when tin is $165 per
picul. In Malaya the duty runs to 144 p.c.
ad valorem , and there are no weighing
charges or Customs fees. British mining
cos. have Bull officials on the job
against the taxes, but the Siamese viceroys
don’t admit interference. Perhaps if Teddy
Miles was shipped up with another platypus-
skin rug he might do the trick where others
have failed.

The just-published accounts of the Ratrut
Basin Go. for the year to May 31 last—the
co. has its headquarters in Sydney and
dredging concessions in West Siam—illus-
trate the cut the Siamese Government is
taking out of tin profits. Of the £54,522
received from sales no less than £10,73S
was paid in duty. Here is the co.’s
dredging record to May 31—the first line
representing eight months’ work only:—
Tin Values Costs
Handled, oxide, lb. per, per
cub. yds. tons. cub. yd. cub. yd.
1917 .. 492,000 182.7 .83 3.92 d.
1918 .. 691,000 302.3 .98 5.07 d.
During the year a number of improvements
were made to the plant, and dredging opera-
tions were slowed down somewhat to effect
better recoveries. The improved recovery
and the high price of tin increased the aver-
age value per cub. yd. treated from 11.47 d.
to 15.31 d. The increase in costs was chiefly
due to the dredge requiring a big supply of
spares, and partly to an all-round rise due
to war conditions. . Working profit w r as
£25,932, and after providing amole deprecia-
tion all round the net profit was £24,576.
Four Is. divs., absorbing £20.000. were dis-
tributed, equal to 20 p.c. on the paid-up capi-
tal of £lOO.OOO. The four months to the
end of October were even more profitable,
324,000 cub. yds. giving 146 tons tin oxide
and a working profit of £17,371. Share-
holders have also received two further Is.
divs. The financial position of the co. was
quite comfortable at May 31: liabilities
amounted to £3820, and there were more or
less liquid assets amounting to £24,960.
Some of the plant of that smudged con-
cern, the Riverina South (W.A.), is a super-
creation ; and to re-model it has mopped up
a lot of cash. That has choked off develop-
ment, so that manager Walton advises only
15.795 tons worth £37,657. That seems fair
sampling in view of the last six years’
crushings of 4196 tons for £9109. As costs
absorbed £31,000, the job wasn’t profitable
even without charging up £2OOO for develop-
ment. So dreary became the position that
Stewart, M.G.E.. F.C.S., has been put on to
nose out possibilities. The parallel-lode theory
he scraps, and he won’t have shaft sinking tiff
the driving of No. 3 level at 285 ft. shows
whether the main Riverina and Ferminger's
shoots persist to that level, or if any other
makes can be picked up between the two
shafts. Then, if the low-grade stone at
the old Duchess workings can be made help,
“a profit-earning low-grade mine may be
inaugurated.” No w'onder the temperature
is hot in Queen-street. £26,500 gone into
plant which has only grubbed along, £6b<
owing debenture-holders, and £5OOO due to
bank and sundry creditors, with only a low-
grade profit-earning era incubating.
South Kalgurli (W.A.) scrip continues to
soar, and no one seems to know why. So
far this year’s profits amount only to a
few thousands, costs are now several shil-
lings higher than they were before the war,
ore reserves when last estimated were barely
35 months ahead of the mill, and recent
progress reports give no indication of any
improvement in values. On paper the shares
appear to be too high, but then there may
be something doing about which the public
knows nothing. Another Kalgoorlie gold
stock which has gone up in price lately is
the Lake View and Star. The rise in this
case is attributed to good developments in
the Boulder Main Reef section of the co.’s
holding. Tributors are said -to be responsi-
ble for these developments.
Black Range West (W.A.), in which
mostly Sydney capital has been sunk, is
still hopeful of making money for sharehold-
ers. Some time ago it took over a lease con-
taining the southern extension of the reef
formerly worked by the Black Range co. at
Sandstone, but a heavy flow of water de-
layed operations. Pumping plant has since
been installed and work is expected to be in
full swing again after Christmas. There is
gold in the property, but whether the co. will
ever be able to pay divs. is another matter.
Yuanmi (W.A.), whose prospects Hoover,
Govett and others used to prate about before
the war, has failed to show anything of value
in the No. 7 or bottom level. For the first
two or three hundred feet the outlook was
good. Then a poor zone was struck; and
when that was passed through refractory
ore, which proved most difficult to treat, was
met with. Now it looks as if even that has
cut out.

Great Fingall (W.A.) got further exemp-
tion the other day on condition that tribu-
tors be allowed to come in on liberal terms.
There are some places in the mine where
parties of working miners might fluke an
occasional rich crushing, but for a co. with
250,000 shares like the Fingall there is
practically nothing.
Gibraltar, near Coolgardie (W.A.), is
again on the lookout for mine-buyers. Several
options are being hawked round Perth, but
Capital got such a bad doina- the last time
that it is not likely to want a second helping.
The locality came into prominence about
three years agV>. when a lease then known
as the Bullabulling was acquired by a ven-
turesome Melbourne co. The vendor, it is
stated, got £5OO, the promoter £3500, and
flotation expenses absorbed £6OO, or a total
of about one-half of what the public sub-
scribed. A little work was done, but ro.‘ Its
not proving satisfactory the ground was
abandoned and liquidation followed. Now
2oz. values are alleged to be visible all over
the mine.
* * * *
A clamor has again been raised in Ival-
goorlie for an amendment of the Mining
Act in respect to new finds. In the case of
one recent find scores of leases were pegged,
but only a few had the pick put into them.
Most of the peggers simply squatted on their
areas and waited to see if the original dis-
covery turned out well. As it didn’t they
packed up their belongings and cleared out.
Had the ground not been tied up when the
rush was on and interest in the find was
red hot a number of the blocks, it is con-
tended, would have been given a trial. The
same thing happened in the case of another
recent find. The local agitation demands
that every applicant for a lease should un-
dertake to do a certain amount of sinking
or an equivalent amount of costeening. The
genuine prospector, it is argued, would not
object, while speculative pegging would be
discouraged.

The Amalgamated Zinc people are san-
guine that the electrolytic zinc works at
Risdon (Tas.) will turn out a big success.
Costs are expected to come down consider-
ably as the output of zinc increases, for the
same highly-paid staff which produced 65
tons of zinc a week some time ago is now
turning out 90 tons per week. A much
larger output is talked of when increased
power is available. The Anaconda zinc
works at Gt. Falls (U.S.A.) have been
turning out 90 tons of zinc per day. It is
estimated that 1750 tons of concentrates per
week can eventually be treated at Risdon.

The Oaks, Etheridge (Q.), is struggling to
make a big low-grade proposition pay exes.
A battery of 10 stampers crushed 10,010
tons during the year ended September 30
for 13300 z. of gold valued at £4321. With
other receives the revenue totalled £4813:
but expenditure amounted to £5012. Ex-
traction w r oi'ked out at 2.65dwt. per ton, and
although this return paid for mining and
milling, administration exes, and debenture
interest increased costs to 10s. per ton. A
scheme to increase the battery power is
under consideration.

“C.”: The cost of producing blister at
Mount Cuthbert was exceptionally high last
half-year, but: it isn’t fair to heap all the
blame on to labor. During the six months
Cuthbert smelted 28,554 tons of ore and
metal-bearing fluxes for a return of 1426
tons of blister copper, so the management
was endeavoring to make a furnace extrac-
tion of 5 p.c. copper show a profit. The
working account actually shows a surplus,
but after providing for depreciation and in-
terest there was a loss of £3742. It is
certainly a stroke of luck for the co. that
bulky high-grade ore-bcdies are opening up
in the Kalkadoon mine.
* * * »
“S.C.”: Apparently the N. S. Wales
Mines Department has a thirst for informa-
tion concerning mines, fields and new dis-
coveries. but when it comes to disseminating
the information it falls down on the job.
Geologists and mining surveyors tour
around and make exhaustive examinations,
and presumably compose voluminous re-
ports, but the public never appear to get
into contact with them, although they do
the paying. They may, of course, be of ser-
vice to the Departmental officials, but a
system of letting the mining public have the
benefit of the expert knowledge therein
would considerably assist the mining in-
dustry. If, in the absence of a medium such
as the Queensland Government Mining
Journal, wherein all such reports are pub-
lished as issued, a few copies could be sent
to the Warden’s office in the districts con-
cerned, where they could be obtained at
small cost by the people vitally interested,
some material benefit might accrue to the
mining industry and the country at large
for the cost of such scientific inquiry. It’s
not of much use pigeon-holing the informa-
tion supplied by an expensive staff of
geological and mineralogieal experts in the
Department in Sydney. The Department has
certainly produced one valuable and compre-
hensive volume, J. E. Game’s work on the
copper industry; but why not similar works
on gold, lead-silver, tin, coal, iron, molyb-
denite, etc.?


THE ULTIMATUM.
FATHER DROUGHT: “Glad to see you. I’m going to work the place with you on shares. Your share is what I leave.”

N. S. Wales District Court Judges Docker
and Fitzhardinge have made farewell
speeches to the Bar on their retirement. The
former (son of an old Parliamentarian, Dr.
Joseph Docker) was born on April 1, 1842,
and was called to the Bar in N. S. Wales in
June, 1867. After serving an apprentice-
ship as Crown Prosecutor he was appointed
to the D.C. Bench in 1884, to which billet he
hung with great pertinacity for 34 years,
amidst much adverse criticism on his methods
and peculiarities. In his day he made a
presentable figure in the cricket field.
Grantley Hyde Fitzhardinge (son of an old-
time solicitor, W. G. A. Fitzhardinge) was
called to the Bar in June, 1868, and served
as Crown Prosecutor before being appointed
to the Bench, dated in 1893. The Fitzhard-
ingc line of sport was with the oar, the
whole family in the early days of aquatics
being boat- and yacht-men.
FIRST-AID IN FINANCE.
There is at present a shortage of pennies.
"Give as the price of a drink, Mister. I
don’t mind takin' notes if yer short of
coppers.”
Bishop Wood, of Melanesia, who has
resigned, is an honest sort of cleric. He
gave as his reason that his staff unani-
mously passed a vote of want-of-confidence
in him. Not having a supporter left in the
crowd his unpopularity dawned on him. and
he quitted. If The Bulletin was a British
peer with livings to give away it would offer
one to Mr. Wood. His thoroughness is
refreshing where so many are half-hearted.
Edward Mitchell, who passed out in Gee-
long the other day, aged 92, was an un-
attached member of the Burke and Wills
expedition, but, like the other unofficial mem-
bers, he was not allowed to go further than
Menindie. Mitchell’s boyhood days were
spent at Windsor. His father was physician
to William IV.
. Field-Marshal Douglas Haig on May 4,
signed the visitors’-book at South Head Fort,
Sydney, as Captain Haig of the 7th Hus-
sars. S. M. Herald states that his mother
wag a Tasmanian. According to “Who’s
Who,” he is the son of John Haig, of Cam-
eronbridge Fife, and Rachel, fourth daugh-
ter and co-heiress of Hugh Veitch, of
Stewartfield, Midlothian.
Alderman English is the fifth R.C. to fill
the municipal chair of Sydney.
Few honors come to those who occupy
staff positions in a base headquarters; yet
Captain Stillman, of A.I.F. Headquarters,
Cairo, has done big
things for his coun-
try since he left
Victoria as a lance-
corporal in 1914.
In the early days
of the war he was
one of the records
section in the old
Intermediate Base,
Cairo; but when
the infantry de-
parted for France
he received promo-
tion and took
charge of the
affairs of our horse-
men and cameliers.
Captain Stillman
is well known in
Cairo sporting and
society circles, and
made several jour-
neys to the front
line in Palestine.

“B.B.”: Stated (B. 5/12/’18) that, with
the exception of General Royston and Lieut.-
Colonel N. B. de Lancey Forth, no officer on
the Palestine Front possessed a more
charmed life than Lieut. “Jock” Davidson, of
the Camel Corps. Every man in the Camel
Corps will agree with me that de Lancey
Forth was one of the luckiest men who ever
took part in a scrap. During the second big
attack on Gaza the Cameliers dashed across
300 yards of shell and machine-gun swept
ground, and took shelter in the dry bed of
the Wadi Ghuzze. I was one of a small
group who failed to reach the Wadi, and as
we lay in the grass 50 yards away it seemed
as if every inch of ground around us was
lashed bv bullets, with an occasional “Jack
Johnson” thrown in as a bonus. Just when
I was wondering if the will in my pay-book
was properly made out. I was surprised to
see de Lancey Forth coolly approaching us
from the rear. The Bosche machine-gunners,
recognising his rank, immediately concen-
trated their fire upon him, and the Austrian
gunners' lent a hand. The Lieut.-Col-
strolled from man to man speaking a cheer-
ing word to each of them. Then he gave a
sharp command, and we dashed toward the
Ghuzze. Later on in the day wlmn two com-
panies of the Cameliers had been almost
annihilated, md we were being pressed back
bv hordes of Turks fodds ebmit 10 to 1). de
r.ancev Forth never took shelter, but walked
around the fields of death as if on parade,
f pter in the evening we heard that his
helmet Imd been punctured in four places
tb" f he had been shot through the shoul-
der. The same luck dogged him in other
b"tt.les. He was probably the most popular
officer who ever led Anzac«. Tf lie returns
to the pearling grounds of Broome it’s up to
every inhabitant to chuck him a salute.
Lt.-Colonel Vernon. D. 5.0.. just returned
to Australia, left in 1914 as second in com-
mand of the Ist A.L.IL, and after that regi-
ment left the Peninsula at the Evacuation
he took command of a Divisional Ammuni-
tion Train in France, where he got his
D.S.O. In private life the Colonel is an
architect. He is the eldest son of the late
Colonel Vernon, who was Government archi-
tect in N. S. Wales.
Frank Wilson. Westralian Premier 191 fi-
ll, who died on December 8, aged 59 years,
was a Sunderland man and founder of a firm
of marine engineers and boiler-makers. He
was schooled by the Moravians at Neuwied,
on the Rhine, and at Wesley College, J3hef-
field. He arrived in Queensland in 18S(, and
went to the West in 1891 as manager for
the Canning Jarrah Timber Co. Ltd. He
was a Perth City Councillor for three years,
M.L.A. for Canning in 1897. for Perth in
1901 and for Sussex in 1904. He held
several portfolios, winding up with the Pre-
miership. At the coronation of the fifth
George he saw fair play on behalf of West-
ralia.
Adrian Knox, K.C., who appeared in wig
and gown (200 guineas was mentioned as
his fee) at the bar of the N. S. Wales Legis-
lative Assembly to state the case for the
Public Service Board in reply to the stric-
tures of a Royal Commissioner last week,
was no stranger to the Chamber. He repre-
sented Woollahra in the 16th and 17th
Parliaments, 1894-98. In that term he
refused the Parliamentary stipend.
Walter Howchin has the distinction of
receiving the first honorary professorship
conferred by Adelaide University. Howchin
lately sent a copy of his new book, “The
Geology of South Australia,” to the Univer-
sity Council for its library. Members re-
ferred to the value of his scientific work, and
noted with pleasure that it had been greatly
commended in many quarters. The Council
resolved to thank him for the volume, con-
gratulate him on his successful and profitable
investigations, and to make him an honorary
professor. Howchin will now be attached to
the University staff as lecturer on geology
and palaeontology.
“Country Peel”: Mention of the late
Francis Foy and his father, Mark (B.
21/11/T8), reminds me of a little-known fact
concerning the founder of the great drapery
business. Mark Foy left Graytown (Vic.)
in 1870 practically penniless and driving a
bullock-waggon. Some time after he camped
at suburban Collingwoocf, and 'where he
boiled his billy and wondered about the
future there stands to-day one of the largest
department stores in Melbourne—Foy and
Gibson’s.
White, whose promotion to colonel has
just been gazetted, is one of the group
of brilliant Queensland Light Horse
officers which included Generals Chauvel,
Brand, Glasgow and Dodds. He has
been on staff work practically all his
soldiering life, and was a “specialist”
in Light Horse work. During the earlier
days of the war he was in charge of numer-
ous L.H. instructional schools, and, later,
was D.A.Q.M.G. before going to England on
special service. He was a great horseman
in his younger days, but was so roughed up
by a spill some years ago that he was never
really fit enough thereafter for front-line
service. General Brudenell 'White, the brain
of the Australian army, and “Jack”
White, late chief inspector of Queensland
Police, are brothers.
Colonel Purdey, Sydney’s City Health
Officer, is back after the best part of four
years at the Front with the A.M.C., most
of which time was spent with the Egyptian
section of the A.I.F. He first saw active
service in South Africa with the Maoriland-
ers, and later was one of the M.O.’s with
Plumer’s flying column.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” : Mathew Henry
Stephen, knighted as Sir Henry, who had
his 90th birthday this month, is the second
son of Sir Alfred Stephen, many years Chief
Justice and Lieut.-Governor of N. S. Wales;
his mother was the daughter of Mathew Con-
sett, a London merchant, born in Hobart
Town, where his father was Solicitor-Gen-
eral at the time of his birth. The father
came to Sydney in 1839 as a Judge of the
Supreme Court; the son went to Sydney
College—now the Grammar School —where
he took prizes, and when old enough became
associate to bis father, which service enabled
him to be called to the Bar in 1850. the first
colonial-born to be admitted. He sat in the
Leg. Assembly for a short time as member
for Mudgee, but politics had little attraction
for him. Grandfather (John Stephen),
father (Alfred Stephen) and son (M. H.
Stephen) have had seats on the Supreme
Court Bench.
The death of ex-miner Percy Russell
removes one of the best platform-men of
the Victorian Labor party. Russell, latterly
a Trades Hall official, put up a long battle
with the Reaper, trying various sanatoriums
until he finally settled down in the Yarra-
side village of Warraudyte to await the end.
His last effort concerned with public affairs
was the instigation of an inquiry into the
management of the Greenvale Sanatorium,
the business being pushed on by Edmond
Hogan, M.L.A. Various painful details
were brought to light, and quantities of
whitewash were used, but the stirring-up
undoubtedly helped to put the affairs of
this and similar State institutions on a
better basis. He was only 35 when he got
out of the turmoil.
“Bowyang” : Too modest to talk about his
extraordinary feats in the air. little has been
heard of Major “Peter” Drummond, of the
R.F.C., Palestine. This officer (he is 22
years young) probably accounted for more
enemy machines than any other aviator in
PREMIER LAWSON (Victoria).
the Holy Land, and if the enemy recognised
his ’plane they rarely approached within
shooting distance. Major Drummond took
part in most of the lighting at Anzac, and
wag later invalided to Australia. Returned
to the Palestine Front, and after serving for
a time with the Australian Flying Corps lie
was transferred to the Imperial section. His
most thrilling exploit took plaice shortly
after the capture of Gaza. Observing a com-
rade in distress in enemy territory, he
alighted and went to his assistance; but when
he re-entered his machine the engine refused
to work. Meanwhile several Turkish troops
raced toward Drummond, who eventually
managed to get his ’bus to work, and she
arose, only to fall again a few hundred
yards away. Three times it lifted and fell,
but he got clear. Drummond wears the rib-
bons of several decorations awarded for
bravery in the air.
An English officer in Palestine who gained
the respect of the Anzacs was Major Huddle-
ston, who, at his own request, was trans-
ferred from the Egyptian army to take
charge of the Ist Anzac Battalion Camel
Corps. Prior to the late war Major Huddle-
ston had done big things in the Soudan and
South Africa. His first job on taking charge
of the Cameliers was to see that an improve-
ment was made in their ration and clothing
issue. He had a decided objection to trying
Billjim for a breach of duty, and during the
period he commanded the battalion the men
put up a record for good behavior. When
he was promoted to Lieut.-General and
transferred to command an English division,
ho told the Cameliers that they were the
finest fighters he had ever led into battle.

Somehow the writer would never have anything to do with patent medicines of any description, having a decided
prejudice against any that were largely advertised.
A bottle of your remedy, however, was placed in my ban ds, and out of courtesy to my friend, who had an interest in
my welfare, I ventured to take it as advised.
With pleasure I Write you that since taking Clements' T onic my system is braced up and my general health much
improved.
In such a calling as mine the nervous tension is always high, and I
assure you that it is good to find something that really benefits.
A good thing is always worth passing on.
I am, Sirs, yours sincerely, (Signed) ' Pastor,

TROOPSHIP STANDING ORDERS.
Man Overboard.
The following routine will be strictly ohserved
when a private falls overboard
Report same to Orderly-Corporal, who (after
making the necessary entry in the said private’s
training-card) will proceed to the Sergeant’s quar-
ters and awake the Orderly-Sergeant. He will in
turn report to the Platoon Commander. The P.C.
later on to report same to the Company-Commander,
and should he think it of sufficient importance he
will suggest to the Adjutant that a Board of
Inquiry be appointed to ascertain:—
1. How came this man to fall overboard ?
2. Has he some ulterior motive in doing so?
3. Has this man his musketry and training-cards
entered up ?
4. Should the ship be stopped and a boat lowered
to his rescue ?
Should the Board consider that the man fell over-
board accidentally, that he had no ulterior motive
in doing so, and that the cards were in his posses-
sion, they MAY instruct the ship’s Q.M.S. to requi-
sition for a lifebelt. This done the duty company
will be informed by the Staff-Officer Reinforce-
ments, per medium of the ship’s Sergeant-Major,
that a fatigue parti' of one N.C.O. and two men
must be detailed' to throw a lifebelt in the direc-
tion in which the man was last seen.
Paragraph 2.
In the event of a DUNTROON SERGEANT fall-
ing overboard the following procedure WILL be
STRICTLY observed, the slightest departure from
same will cause the offender being tried by General
Court-martial for a criminal offence: —
1. All lifeboats to be lowered into the sea.
2. All rafts and anything floatable to be cast into
the sea.
3. All units to parade with lifebelts. Same to
be thrown in his direction.
4. All gangways to be instantly lowered.
5. Oil to be poured on the waves.
6. Wireless signals to be sent in all directions.
7. All men to kneel in an attitude of prayer and
supplication.
8. Ships band to play suitable tune, such as
“Throw Out the Lifeline.”
9. If the lifeboat fails to pick up the Duntroon
Sergeant, the Captain of the boat to be ordered to
take the ship back to Australia and report that
the war is lost.

“Ses”: Two soldiers were mooching along
in front of me the other day, one wearing
an overcoat and the other blue arm-bands.
They stopped at the side entrance of a pub
and Bill shed his overcoat, which Jim put
on. Thus camouflaged, they stepped in and
had one. In another bar a soldier, after
draining his glass, took a blue arm-band
from his pocket and Wiped his mouth with
it. It Was his armkerchief.

The Hun, in all his varieties, is a poor,
snuffling loser. An appeal has gone from
Hungary to the aggregate MacPherson in
Scotland urging that if Hungary is divided
into separate States according to nationali-
ties, “an outpost of Protestantism will be
destroyed.” About one-sixth of the popula-
tion of Hungary is Protes-
tant and the ruling Magyar
caste is almost wholly R.C.
But the Hun would pose as
an outpost of cannibalism if
there was anything in it.

“,T.11.” : Home-coming Aus-
tralian warriors in Victoria
are beginning to say harsh
things about the distribution
of the “Returned from Ac-
tive Service” badges. They
assert that many soldiers
who show the decoration
never wenS beyond Port
Phillip Heads; and that
other wearers proceeded far-
ther afield only in a more or
less non-professional capa-
city. Badges of this descrip-
tion have been issued to men
who served in the A.M.C. on
transports with the Aus-
tralian Comforts Fund, the
Red Cross Society and the
Y.M.C.A. Billjim acknow-
ledges the essential work
these men have done, but has
a little notion (not to be

eligibles employed in these
organisations reached a high
total. The industrious and
useful ofMders certainly
deserve a badge in recogni-
tion of their labor, but “Re-
turned from Active Service”
does not fill the bill. Be-
stowed thus, it gives the
non-combatant more than
his due and cheapens the
honor emblem in the eyes of Billjim, the man
who has really earned it.

“D.”: This is the chauffeur’s version:
“This Henry Seeley—which isn’t quite his
name, but it’ll do—was a bit of a gay lad,
and had a nice, polite way of slippin’ you
half-a-quid that I liked; so having been in
with him on some previous occasions I
wasn’t above goin’ out of my way to meet
his washes just for once more. When he
come to me about this little affair he was
what you’d call diplomatic, and instead of
sayin’ straight out what the game was he put
it to me that it was an ordinary sort of date,
callin’ for peace ’n’ quiet, and a lurk of
patient waitin’ under the park trees in the
dark, but nothin’ very special in the tvay of
strategics, subterfuge and low cunnin’; so I
jest rolls me old taxi in under cover well on
time, and leaves it to the lady to come
when she dash well likes. I’m waitin’ and
watchin’ when the affable stranger chances
along and gets talkin’ politics and war,
THE WINE AND THE WIT.
“Yes, I pride myself on keeping good wine, Now, this is something like champagne!"
“Um; yes; quite a remarkable resemblance."
and presently admits he has the back-door
key of the little pub opposite the. big gate.
I chances it, and has one, and when I get
back there’s her ladyship perched inside in
silent anticipation. All’s for the best so
far. I pulls out and bores across along the
shore to the place appointed, where I’m to
pick up Mr. Henry Seeley. Henry’s waitin’
all impatience, and jumps in, I head for
Sandringham, lettin’ her do her best, and
presently there’s sounds of an internal dis-
turbance. He’s havin’ words with, her, I
gather. Then there’s a, cry what fetches
me up, all brakes hard-on. Silence. Then:
‘Great heavings—she’s dead!’ I’m down
and out, but Henry meets me, his nut out
of tile window. ‘No, no,’ sez he, ‘my mis-
take. Only a faint. Drive on, and put some
go in it.’ I drove on till we come to quite
a scrubby bit of track Black Rock way,
and now I’m conscious of things goin’ on.
S’elp me if Henry ain’t opened the door,
and flung the body out. Now, that’s one-
and-a-half too many for our George. I
draws the line at Hingin’ dead bodies about,
and pulls up to say so. Henry’s out to
meet my argument. I informs him I’m
goin’ back for the corpse. ‘Don’t be a
dam’ fool,’ says he. ‘Get on.’ ‘Not on your
life,’ says I. ‘When it comes to illegitimate
and surreptitious disposal of the dead I’m
not available.’ ‘You drive on,’ says he, ‘and
there’s another quid for you.’ Too cheap
for George. ‘I give you my word of honor
there’s nothin’ wrong,’ he insists. That’s
a matter of opinion. It may be wrong to
drop dead ladies along lonely roads, then
again it may not; but George is taking no
such risks. Henry gets fierce at this, and
puts ’em up to me. Well, I hadn’t any
difficulty in the world in findin’ his mark,
and leavin’ him in the dust to recover his
wind, I swings back for the body. It’s
there all right, lyin’ tumbled, horrid and
ghastly in the ti-tree, and I hoists it up,
intendin’ to belt it off to the police, nem.
con. Well, I dunno what that feller was
what tempted me away to drink,. or how
much the lady’s husband may have known,
or whether it was vanity forced Henry to
resist me, all I do know' is that the dead
lady that I held in my arms was nothin’
but a w 7 ell-stulfed and cleverly-faked-dummy.
I went back for Henry, but er-las! he had
departed.”

It does not frequently happen that a dead
man is enabled to save lives after, he has
been securely placed in his coffin, but this
occurred in Maoriland recently. A train
from Auckland to Wellington picked up, en
route, a mortuary van containing the body
of a railway employee w T ho had succumbed
to influenza. This van was placed next the
engine, just in front of the postal van, the
latter being followed by a second-class car-
riage. On the journey there happened a
severe landslip, and the engine dashed into
the obstruction. The mortuary van and the
postal van were smashed to atoms. Two of
.the postal agents were killed on the spot
and two died later. Those in the second-
class carriage were severely knocked about
by the impact, and there is no doubt what-
ever that but for the intervention of the
A PUZZLER.
“Mummy, is that Father Christmas or Jack
Frost?"
mortuary van the carriage would have
shared the fate of the postal van and many
deaths would have resulted. Strangely
enough the coffin containing the body was
thrown clear of the train and was uninjured.

WORLD-LOVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am in love with the world,
With the seas laughing joy to the moon,
With tlie great clouds folded and furled
That will bring up the sweet rain soon.
With the black fans flirting on trees,
Tall branches that simper and bow
To the cool kiss of the breeze
Stealing over the round hill’s brow.
(Love, are you sleeping there
With the moon white on your hair?)
I am in love with the world,
With a lemon-bush scenting the night,
And a close rose daintily curled
Under a high window’s light.
There shall be singing within,
There shall be sighing without* —
A sighing of thistles blown thin,
A singing of lovers in doubt.
(Sleep well, for the doubt goes by
In the lift of a morning eye!)
I am in love with the world,
With its stones, with ,its voices of men,
With the bolts of the lightning hurled
And the creeping delight of a pen,
AVith the fruits of the Garden olden—
For of every fruit would I eat
Till I come to the apple golden
Where knowledge and wonder meet.
(Dear, we shall eat together,
liven as Adam, and live,
And hold that snake in his tether
Of old, dull make-believe.)

The casting of the “all-iron Beale frame is
a very important task. A high degree of
skill is necessary in order to turn out a flat
frame, sound in all parts, soft enough to drill,
yet tough and free from unseen strains caused
by irregular shrinkage. It is not an ordinary
iron founder’s job at all In Germany,
England and America piano makers have
their frames cast by separate iron foundry
firms. This does not make for the very
finest workmanship, however. It is because
of the super-care in every stage of manufacture
that the “Beale” is such a beautifully toned
instrument The better musician you are,
the more you will appreciate the “ Beale.

ACID STOMACHS NEED MAGNESIA.
Drugs may give temporary relief from the
pain which usually results from an excess of
acid in the stomach, but drugs do not elimi-
nate the acid, and in consequence the pain
returns-—worse than before. To effect a cure
3,°u must first eliminate the acid which is
the cause of all the trouble, and a sure way
to accomplish this is to take a little bisurated
magnesia after your meals. This quickly
neutralises the harmful acid, prevents the
rood turning sour and fermenting, soothes
and heals the inflamed stomach, and enables
you to again eat and enjoy the foods you
fancy, secure in the knowledge that no pain
O'* discomfort will result. Of course it will
be- understood that ordinary forms of mag-
nesia, such as the citrates or sulphates, will
not accomplish these happy results, neither
will crude mixtures of bismuth and magnesia,

is a form prepared specially for use in cases

readily be obtained of high-class chemists

From the Jordan Valley:—
' s n ln rny scanty bivvy, hot arid gasping, wonder-
ing where in this hell I am to get a little shade—
jusu :t little to break this intolerable heat that beats
down through everything in the shape of canvas.
The camp is upon the banks of the stream, a
strongly-flowing one, 20 yards across. On either
side the banks run out level to the foot of dirty,
chalky cliffs rising sheer to 200 ft. Above the cliffs
the ground stretches away fairiy level, and runs live
or six miles to the foothills of the Judaean hills on
one side and the mountains of Moab on the other.
The valley is like a great slice cut into the earth's
sui face. As far as the eye can see the heat haze
shimmers and dances. Dozens of thin, snaky
“willy-willies” move across the cinsty land, now
stationary, again racing away, gathering every mov-
able thing in their maw, and descending on camps,
upending shelters and frightening horses.
And the dust! It is anathema to us—vile, un-
speakably vile. The lightest breeze moves it. The
foot sinks into it almost to the knee. It burns the
ei es, and men tie handkerchiefs across their mouths
to keep from suffocating. It settles on the face
of the perspiring rider and renders him unrecognisable,
ihe dust of the Jordan Valley is in our vitals and
will go to the grave with us. In the river-bed men
are bathing and washing horses. They lie in the
water the livelong day, the one place where tem-
porary relief can lie had from the heat. Others
drag themselves listlessly about their duties or lie
prone in the scanty shelter of their bivvies.
On first coming here it was told us: “It is im-
possible for a white man to live through the sum-
mer. Even the natives leave for the hills.” Yet
we have put in six months in the Valley ; but now
the effects of our sojourn are appearing. Malaria is
rife, and in a great percentage of cases in the worst
form. Everyone appears to be affected, more or
less, it is playing havoc in the ranks and fast
filling the hospitals. Men when lying wracked with
fever have good occasion to remember what their
stay in the Jordan Valley did for them.

“A Trooper Billjim’’: “Bill Bowyang’s”
statement (B. 29/8/TS) that the Imperial
Camel Corps has sustained the greatest
number of casualties of any Australian unit
here, in proportion to its strength, may possi-
bly be correct, but he oilers no explanation
why they were so badly etr. d. One might
be misled to infer that they had had the most
fighting. They didn’t. The Anzac Mounted
Division (Ist, 2nd Aus. and M.L. Brigades)
holds the palm, both for the longest period
on the desert and the most work done. They
have not missed a scrap since crossing the
Canal (they crossed several months ahead of
the others, and were, to all intents and pur-
poses, the only Anzacs at the battle of
Romani). Later they did many a scrap on
their own without aid from either the

whose horses were always within easy dis-
tance, and so, when once committed to
action, they could not pull out, like we could,
if they found the position too hot for ’em. It
was a case of hang on, with consequent heavy
casualties. They practically had to fight an
infantry action. In the push in November,
’l7, the Camelos were in a bad way at a
place called Kheweilfeh, above Beersheba.
and a L.H. Machine Gun Squadron lost 50-
odd men in a gallant and successful attempt
to extricate them. Still, all honor to the
Camelos. They were a most picturesque
unit, and earned the name of the staunchest
fighters and hardest doers in the desert.

“Mannamead”: Early in this year I re-
ceived from Paris a copy of L'lllustration,
dated December 8, 1917. It
contained a double page and a
smaller drawing by d’Albert
Sebille, of one of the class of
“Hush” ships in which Balfour
travelled to America in four days
and returned in the same time.
The double-page drawing showed
not onlv the “Hush” ship, but de-
stroyers, captive balloons and the
aeroplanes at Rosyth, as explained
fully by the writer of the article
accompanying the drawings. When
this issue of LTlltjstration ap-
peared the Germans were within
100 miles of Paris. In March of
this year (he lelustrateij Lon-
don News reproduced these draw-
ings (undoubtedly with the con-
sent of the Imperial Naval authori-
ties), but when some seven or
eight months ago my copy of
LTlltjstration was. through a
Sydney paper, sent to the Censor
here, 12.000 miles from the seat
of hostilities, permission to publish
it was refused. Now that peace is
? practically assured, the Censor has gra-
ciously permitted its production, and it
appeared last week. A great and abiding joy
is the Hughes-Watt brand of Censor!

Among the Allied prisoners wild are
coming back are many whom the Hun has
tattooed or branded on the face with insult-
ing inscriptions or hideous designs. This
was done to express his idea of “peace bv
negotiation without annexations or indemni-
ties.’ The men are going to be repaired, in
part at least, by a long and painful process
of skin-grafting. But if some of them
would take an extra pension instead of the
repairs, and agree to settle in various parts
of the empire, they would do good by keep-
ing history alive. A few of them, made
honorary members of all Peace Societies by
Act of Parliament, wouldn’t come amiss in
Australia.
T. 0.1.” : I have just discovered
an ancient anecdote which has an
• Australian connection. An Irish
judge tried two most notorious
men for highway robbery. To
the astonishment of the Court, as
well as the prisoners themselves,
they were found “not guilty.” As
they were being removed from the
dock the Judge, addressing the
gaoler, said: “Mr. Murphy, you
would greatly ease my mind' if
you would keep those two respect-
able gentlemen until 7 or half-past
7 o'clock, for I mean to set out
for Dublin at five, and I should
like to have at least two hours’
start of them.” John Murphy,
who was gaoler (or. as now called,
governor) 0 f Cork County gaol in
the twenties and thirties of last
century, was father of Francis
Murphy, who became Speaker of
the Vic. Legislative Assembly.
“F.”: A medical authority the other
day dubbed the Girls’ High School, in Castle-
reagh-street, Sydney, as an “educational
crime and a public scandal.” The old brick
building, having frontages to Elizabeth and
Castlereagh streets, was built as a school-
house by Governor Macquarie. In it, how-
ever, the first court held under the Charter
of Justice, 1824. had its sitting under Chief
Justice Forbes. There, also. Father
1 berry was permitted to celebrate mass
before a proper chapel was erected.
In those days only the Anglicans were
allowed to call their places of worship
churches. The ground originally belonged
to one Rose, who had the “Rose and Crown
Inn on the south-east corner of King and
Castlereagh streets. Macquarie . wanted the
site and gave Rose a grant out Appin way

cational purposes. Being valuable ground
the Government proposes to sell it and shift
the scholars to a new school to be erected
on the site of the old Zoo, in Moore Park.
The recent flight to Vienna of Gabriele
d’Annunzio, poet, novelist and paladin of the
air, reads better than any of his romances.
Embracing his son he mounted his famous
Caproni S,A r .A. (which he alludes to as his
big Daedalian bird ) and set out at dawn
from the war zone near Venice on August 9.

H<pw careful business girls must be.
Thrown on the world where men abound.
And dire temptations hover round.
For six long years I’ve typed all day,
Nor felt my Boss’s fingers play
About my throat, or arm or chin

Glide to the kerb inviting me
For wild joy rides beneath the stars
Or soulful talks beside the sea.
And no one sends me silken hose
Nor says he yearns to buy my clothes,
No artist begs my form to paint—
Fate guards me from the slightest taint.
Amid the city’s roar and din
I’ve never chanced to run down sin,
No millionaires my steps waylay,
Eager for midnight meals to pay.

Were I some little cloistered nun.

This fleet of vehicles was driven overland from Sydney to Melbourne and the trip was accomplished in four days.
Telegraphing to Goodyear Tyres Limited, Sydney, on arrival in Melbourne, Mr. H. Perry, who was in charge
of the fleet says: —
‘Motor Service de Luxe arrived Melbourne mid-day to-day accomplishing the trip on Pneumatic Truck Tyres
without blemish or puncture, could not have got through except for pneumatics, highly satisfactory.’
Melbourne Protects its Good Roads
One of the most picturesque stretches
of road in Melbourne is the run from
Princes Bridge to St. Kilda Beach,
and from the Motorist’s point of
view, the surface is all that can be
desired —practically all the way this
road is wood blocked on concrete
foundation.
The newly inaugurated Motor Service
de Luxe is certainly in keeping with
the fine road, and the progressive
Company who are responsible for the
fleet of Sight Seeing Busses are to be
congratulated on their enterprise.
The chassis are specially built I.H.C. 2 ton
vehicles constructed and assembled by Howard
& Jackson, Sydney, distributors for the Inter-
national Motor Vehicles in New South Wales,
and the bodies fitted are nothing short of
Pullman Cars de Luxe.
As a protection to the Good
Roads over which these
vehicles will travel Goodyear
Cord Pneumatic Truck Tyres
are fitted —they represent the
largest Pneumatic Tyres in
Australia, and are 8 inch
section. Increased speed,
minimum of vibration, low cost
of upkeep, and undoubted
comfort for the passengers are
some of the many points of
advantage claimed by Goodyear
for the “big pneumatics.’

STRENGTH AND ENERGY CREATED
BY PHOSPHATE.
NO TASK TOO HARD.
NO STRAIN TOO GREAT.
There is no longer any reason why the
nervous, hesitant man or woman should envy
those who are strong, resourceful, and. calm,
for, according to an eminent specialist, such
strength is within the easy reach of all who
desire it. Men and women are strong, men-
tally and physically, in proportion to the
strength of their nerves, and nerves are
strong or weak according to the amount of
phosphate they absorb. Ordinarily the nerves
derive phosphate from digested food, but
owing to faulty metabolism or to abnor-
mal strain the phosphate thus taken up
often proves insufficient, and in consequence
the nerves become weak and exhausted. To
remedy such a condition it is necessary that
the nerves should be provided with more
phosphate, and the use of the concentrated
lntro-phosphate, which most chemists now
stock in the form of five-grain compressed
tablets, is highly recommended. Phosphate
in this form is rapidly absorbed, and a de-
cided improvement in the general health is
soon noticeable. Nerves become steady and
strong, and the brain acts quickly and
clearly. Eyes become bright, and the cheeks
glow with healthy color. No task seems too
hard ; no strain too great. Abundant energy
displaces lassitude, and great strength reigns
in the place of weakness.— -jAdyt.

POLITICAL
POINTS
According to Defence Minister Pearce the
Government “has full proof that there are
persons in the Commonwealth endeavoring
to play the same despicable game that had
been played by German agents in Itussia,”
and some of these persons are, he admitted,
still at large. This is where the impatient
crowd stands back and waits for Pearce to
give his overdue cateh-as-catch-can exhibi-
tion, or fold up his mat and move on to
another pitch.
A. 11. Peake, Premier of S.A., relates a
yarn of how lie and others got Henry Parkes,
just then over for a Federation address in
Adelaide, to visit their little south-eastern
town, Naracoorte, to address the inhabitants.
When Parkes got there and found that it
was not S.A.’s second-biggest town or any-
thing like it he was annoyed, especially as
THE BUSY SLUGHTERMEN.
The Government is recommended to consider seri-
ously the question of country killing.
HOLMANn (to Hughes) : “Country-killing,
William! Quite easy! Between the two
of us we’ve nearly done it already."
the neighboring Mount Gambler at once put
in a claim to hear him. His answer to the
second invitation was, by his own account:
“I am now about 80 years of age ; if I live
to be 90 I will promise to consider lecturing
at Mount Gambier.” Also, when the higlily-
respectable chairman of the Naracoorte
meeting arrived, in the low-crowned wide-
awake hat of the period, Parkes looked at
him carefully and remarked : “If I had been
asked to say who this gentleman is I should
have said tiie mayor of the town.. If told to
guess again I should have said a bush-
ranger.”
“The regulation prohibiting the invest-
ment of money in businesses in Australia
except by permission of the Treasurer is
still in force,” said William Watt, the
other day. But the regulation prohibiting
the investment of money in the products of
businesses in every country outside Aus-
tralia isn’t in force and never was.
Holman’s latest explanation is that the
£7,253,000 of loans he spent on the duplica-
tion of N. S. Wales railways has resulted in
a saving of £1,000,000 a year in work-
ing expenses. If that is true, what
did Holman spend the million on? It is
a lunatic’s trick, when you have a
work on hand that will yield 14 per cent,
profit to spend the profit and leave
posterity to pay 5 per cent, on the money.
Apparently the work could have paid for
itself, but' it was charged to loans on prin-
ciple—the same principle that makes some
persons never be sober except by misadven-
ture.
Bunbury (W.A.) has just elected W. L.
Thomas, “independent Laborite” and ex-
M.L.A., as its Mayor. Thomas hails from
.Victoria, but began life as a chemist in X. S.
Wales. He went over to the West in 9o
and brewed medicine, first at Kalgoorlie and
then at Bunbury. He made two unsuccessful
attempts to get into Parliament on the Labor
ticket, but squeezed in on the third. W hen
the trouble occurred last year over conscrip-
tion, he joined the “National party
and became an honorary Minister in the
Government formed by Lefroy. At the
general elections held soon after he was
defeated on the post in a triangular fight by
a local lawyer named Money, who got most
of the anti-llughesites’ second preference
votes.
Over a year ago Victoria’s 1 louse of Con-
versation rushed through a bill authorising
the Government to spend £850,000 in con-
structing wheat silos so that a reasonable
quantity of this and future harvests should
be saved. So far not a silo has been built or
even started; and when you come to consider
thfc quantities of wheat now stored here, the
absence of any large demand for Australian
wheat and the non-existence of an increased
manufacturing population to consume the
grain, the outlook in front of the wheat-
grower is worse than blue —it’s a sort ot
rusty-black.
“Bert R.”: The official attempt to dis-
credit Captain Carmichael’s statement that
the troops are not satisfied with the arrange-
ments for demobilisation of the A.I.F.
makes me tired. Carmichael left with
the 3Gth ' Battalion, was wounded in
action, and spent his convalescence at
A.I.F. headquarters, London, as A.D.C.
to the Commandant. Returning to his
unit before he was properly fit, the win-
ter conditions in the field proved too much
for him, and he was invalided to England, and
admitted to the 3rd London General Hospital.
As soon as he was well enough he started
work at the Agent-General’s office, and dur-
ing the whole time he has been in close per-
sonal touch with the soldiers. Frequently
his advice has been sought by those in charge
in London. Anyhow, there is no man in the
Defence Department as well qualified to
speak on behalf of the troops.
The railways of N. S. Wales have been
put on a paying basis for the time at least
by the simple process of raising fares, and
nebody seems much the worse. Therefore
why not raise them a little more and make
a surplus with which to reduce the railway
debt and the interest bill? Then there
would be some sort of a margin to meet the
next emergency. Every sound financial in-
stitution aims at having a reserve fund, and
even an inherently unsound political institu-
tion like Holman might try it.
Victoria has a scheme on hand whereby
prisoners are to be paid for their labor —
not exactly for their time at so m?uch per
hour of their sentences, with the uswal extra
rates for night-work or night-jug, ’but just
for their labor. And Labor-leader Prender-
gast is afraid that if they are taught 1 factory
industries they may compete with workers
outside. It might occur to Brendergast
that if there are 1.400,000 possible pro-
ducers in a State there are 1,400,000 certain
consumers, and whether 10 or 200,000 people
are in gaol the proportions are the same,
and there should be work for all. The idea
that the consumer in gaol should n,ot pro-
duce so as to make an artificial scarcity of
producers is wrong; but in a country which
systematically keeps down its industries so
as to make room for £70,000,000 or
£80,000,000 worth of foreign goods per
annum many things are possible. I’irender-
gast’s idea is that the prisoners should work
at agriculture, though perhaps pastoral pur-
suits or deep-sea fishing or prospecting would
be better. Still agriculture has its points.
It isn’t a wildly payable industry and it
involves the employment of more warders
than factory work does, and keeps them off
the labor market.
When the settlement of the Pacific is in
question it should be remembered that
Britain has a curious and remarkable claim
thereabouts. Four archipelagoes- h iji,
Tonga, Samoa and Hawaii—had Govern-
ments which were sufficiently clothed to be
articulate in the days when semi-piratical
white adventurers began to bump around in
these seas. Hawaii, which Kamehameha 1. had
built up into something of an empire, made a
good show of holding its own. But the
other three realised that it was a choice ot
masters, and when they saw their possible
masters, the Hun especially, they all aslied
J. Bull to gather them in.
The Lawson Government, out to eltect
fierce economies in I ictoria, lately thieat-
ented to close most of the unoccupied country
gaols and abolish the big city establishment
altogether, and so save several thousands a
rear. Well, the institutions are still in lull
swing, mostly looking after the welfare of
two or three prisoners. Sale gaol lnisn t
had a compulsory visitor for about a year, so
the officials lately borrowed a prisoner from
Wangaratta, just to keep their hands in.
But Chief Sec. Bowser has achieved one
economy. He has withdrawn the Inspector-
General’s all-lines railway pass, so that that
hard-worked individual now has to sign a
voucher every time he boards a train.
MERELY PLAYFULYESS.
Mr Watt denies that any friction between Cook
and Hughes has resulted in delaying repatriation
arrangements.
JOE: “Peep-bo!"
In the/Land of Upside Down a police-
man located a sly-grog depot of long
standing, whereupon the sly-groggist dis-
charged the policeman from the force
for not discovering him earlier. Pre-
mier Holman and the N. S. Wales Pub-
lic Service Commissioners furnish a case in
point, seeing that one of the gravest charges
against them was that they didn’t prevent
Holman and Co. finding a job for one of
their rejected political friends over their
heads arid without their knowledge. Hall,
who is a sort of Father Joseph to Holman’s
Richelieu, put the case that the Commis-
sioners had neglected their duty in not ex-
posing Holman to Parliament. McGirr said
rudely that they would have been “sacked”
if they had. Hall said gravely that they
couldn't be sacked. Yet they were being
sacked.
Herr Schiedemann, who helps to run the
new Hun Government, says that “the Minis-
try has 90 per cent, of the people behind it,
but it is sitting on a powder-keg.” In a coun-
try like Australia the odd 10 per cent, of the
people could certainly make the situation
very powder-keggy. Revolutions can be made
with very small numbers under a weak
Government. A well-organised Rocks push
with its revolver and empty bottle and
perhaps its waddy could scatter 20 times its
number of surprised and disorganised citi-
zens. It could do that even without the
revolver. Barring the interference of organ-
ised forces,, which the peace party holds this
country shouldn’t possess, for fear of mili-
tarism, or if the organised forces were left
without leadership and gradually dissolved, a
very moderate organisation of “direct action”
men could get the community on the run and
not give it time to rally or appoint a royal
commission. With the criminal and lunatic
elements joining in, it might form a Provi-
sional Government at Melbourne or Sydney
Town Hall in a few hours and have posses-
sion of the State's one big city and the rail-
way connections and the whole apparatus.
Provided the captain of the push was some-
thing of a Napoleon he would be firmly
planted in his position before anybody knew
how weak he was. In fact, nobody might
know till years afterwards. Terror and sus-
picion often keep the majority apart, and a
time may even come when Bruce Smith and
McMillan are afraid to collogue together,
each alarmed lest the other may be a secret
agent of the Commune. The apostles broke
up when they heard that Si per cent, of their
force -was unreliable, which isn’t a case in
point, but, may be dragged in as an illustra-
tion.
Melbourne got a small preliminary hint of
the folly of locating the capital in a big city
when a crowd from the Socialists’ Hall went
down to Parliament House to sandbag any
members who wouldn’t vote straight on the
War Precautions law. It was a poor ama-
teur demonstration, but with practice the
crowd may do better. There were times
when the crowd in the gallery of the French
Convention governed the country—that is to
say, it shouted instructions to the legisla-
tors accompanied by threats of stousli. It
was a very select crowd ; in fact, it selected
itself by throwing out lukewarm citizens,
and the handful of red-hot citizens who were
left pushed through some remarkable enact-
ments. They ruled the men who ruled
France. No legislator can take an unbiased
view on the floor of the House when a con-
stituent in the gallery takes a biased view
and also threatens to drop half a tree on
his head.
The Treasurer of South Australia is
apparently at his wits’ end on the sub-
ject of the State’s finances, as he is calling
on all. sundry and etc., to come forward and
put their advice in his suggestion box. The
State’s annual expenditure has jumped up
£50.000 in the form of wages and salaries,
l i:
and another million
could easily be piled
on top of that, were it
not for the hard times
with threatening in-
crease in deficits and
clamorous debtors
within and without.
The State’s credit has
shrunk to such an ex-
tent in London that
the least remark that
Bull, Cohen and Co.
will listen to is a
promise of fi per cent.
Butler says that if he
wanted popularity he
would add a million to
the State’s commit-
ment and dash the
consequences. B u t
Butler never did court
popularity (save from
ids’ thrifty cocky con-
stituents). All he
nsks is to be told where to apply the prun-
ing-knife, and he will slash like a butcher.
Labor-councillor Arthur Page, of South
Melbourne, who is never satisfied except
when spreading out the tail of his coat for
somebody to jump on, has come forward
with a quaint proposal for the betterment
of the working-classes in his suburb. Page
desires that, in order to provide more
houses for the toiler, a strip of land extend-
ing along the whole railway-boundary of
breezy Albert Park should be alienated and
sold. The carrying but of such a proposal,
of course, would mean taking away the pro-
perty of a lot of people and handing it back
to a few of them, in direct opposition to the
ideals of the best class of citizen, who is
perpetually fighting against any encroach-
ment on public parks and gardens. Such a
(suggestion might have been made by a
barnacled Tory, sticking to the mildewed
political ideas held by him for half a cen-
tury ; but, coming from a Labor representa-
tive who is forever howling about the
oppression of the masses, the plan makes
its author appear in what might be termed
an uproarious light.
AFTER THEIR FIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The other night when all else slept,
And earth was still as she might be,
Not e’en the cop his vigil kept,
A curious vision came to me —
I had a view of London town.
The streets were up, the houses down.
It seemed that here before my eyes
The dreadful wreckage of a war
Lay scattered, that some fierce emprise
Of aerial might had reached the shore
Of England, and had ravaged all.
St. James’s tottered to its fall.
There in the ruin stood a cuss.
I stole to have a nearer look.
’Twas Hughes. Then pale and tremulous
Approached his colleague, Joseph Cook.
Joe’s hands v'ere up, great fear he had,
I heard him calling “Kamerad!”

ABORIGINAHTIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
South Australia has some remote small
island possessions which are not known to many.
There are, a number of these dots in the Great
Australian Bight, and 40 miles south-west of Murat
Bay is an archipelago. St. Francis, the name of
the largest of this group of 13 islands, is occupied
by one W. Arnold, his daughter and a partner
named Lloyd. Arnold stalled there 27 years ago.
Thousands of mutton-birds visit the islands, the
rich soil of which is largely composed of bones,
eggshells and guano. They grow watermelons and
tomatoes all the year round, and practically anything
can be cultivated. Quantities of vegetables are run
across to Murat Bay in a small ketch. The Gov-
ernment has granted a lease of the islands, and the
partners are devoting them to sheep-farming. Good
saltbush flourishes there, frosts never occur, and
there is always early feed. Pests are unknown.
Fresh-water springs abound in the granite. Tons
oi fish are available, including whiting weighing
31b. each. Little St. Francis has some military
distinctions to its credit despite its minute popu-
lation. I’. F. Arnold, the #nly son of W. Arnold,
volunteered and is now a lieutenant with the M.M.
D.C.M. and M.C.
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.
BEAK: “ You’re fined ten shillings.”
DEFENDANT: "But are you sure I'm guilty?”
BEAK : “Eh? All right — I’ll make it five
shillings.”
“G.P.M.”: Said Hilligan the drover as
we were discussing the qualities of a sheep-slut.
“Never go by appearances. I once had a jet-
black sheep-dog. As beautiful a dog as you’d
ever see, but quite useless as far as sheep were con-
cerned. You’d try to get him to round up the
weaners, but all he’d do was to dash straight through
the middle of the mob. Well, one day a nevv-chum
cove was looking for a dog; so, of course, I cracked
up Nigger considerably. The new-chum insisted
on a trial, so the first mob of sheep we came across I
sez, ‘Divide ’em, Nigger,’ and, spare me days, the
beggar rushed through the centre and left the sheep
in two mobs. I got a quid for him.”
* * * #
“Werrimee”: The queerest strike I ever
bumped was in a wallaby camp on the Maranoa. The
hunters were all blacks, under one white man, who
batched by the side of a lagoon, four miles from the
blacks’ camp. Trouble arose one afternoon over the
rations and mookine (opium). The mob —all naked—
declared a strike; they piled their rifles at the boss’s
feet, then stood back, some with folded arms, in dig-
nified silence ; others waved their tentacles and yab-
bered their hardest. The boss held up his hand and
the clamor ceased. Then he arbitrated. “You black-
fellow all about come longa my camp to-night.
Bring um gun, blanket—everything. You sit down
every day my camp and hunt wallaby longa ’nother
scrub.” A big blackfeHow stepped forward. “You
gib it plenty mookine, plenty damper, longa camp?”
“Tou get um plenty wallaby, mine give it plenty
ration, plenty mookine,” the boss replied. Another
blackfellow interviewed him. “You gib it me old
pfeller trouser? ’ he solicited. “What do you want
trousers for?” “Me want to see station sometimes.
\ arri want to see um; Sandy want to see um; all
about blackfellor want to see um.” “And you want
trousers for everybody ?” queried the boss. “Baal.
Only one pfeller. Me go station fust time; by-’n’-
by, Yarri go station; Yarri come back, Sandy go
station; Sandy come back.” “All right,” the boss
conceded, “I’ll look up the visiting pants.” Then a
gin stepped up. “You gib it pfrock?” she inquired.
“Don’t wear that one.” “You got um tchirt—long
pfeller?” “What do you want a shirt for?” “Me go
station look about. By-’n’-by, Lucy go station ; Lucy
come back, Nanny go station; Nanny come back.”
“All right,” the boss agreed. “I’ll look up shirt.”
This being satisfactory, the strik.- was declared off.
“Ragar”: When the big black-and-yellow
common house-hornet has a job on he doesn’t
bother about the eight-hour day'. Was called
away recently just as I’d taken out a six-
chambered revolver to clean, and when I returned,
24 hours later, 1 found four chambers and the barrel
packed with dry brown clay'. Mr. Hornet had
finished the job and moved on to the next one. I
picked the mess out and found that each of the four
available chambers contained 18 paralysed spiders,
and from the barrel I shook out 45 more—a total of
117. If only one of him built and stocked that
lying-in hospital and hatchery he is the record for
solid, get-at-it, non-stop work. The spiders were all
of tlie same sort, and are not found anywhere in or
about the house.

“Rita S.” : Snakes and golmnnas are un-
usually active, big and numerous up northern Vic.
way already this summer, following, maybe, on the
unusually wet spell experienced early in the year
and the mice plague of last season. Few snakes or
go’s under Oft. in length have been killed, and
farmers are asking if the visitation may be taken as
a portent of a wet or dry spell ahead? Pa, ma and
the quiverful of the gohanna household make a quaint
family group and one with many characteristics of
the average Wayback family'. All are inquisitive, and
leave Dad to attend to any arguments and serious
business. The thinning out of our birds and rabbits
(hat the cocky vandal has neglected, gohanna and his
kith and kin may be safely depended on to attend to.
Lven the snakes—in the absence of mice—are proving
themselves adepts at rabbit-destruction. Several that
I have come upon in hollow logs recently have had up
to four plump baby bunnies in their respective
commissariats.

0.1. . Recent mention of the musical
sound of Tasmanian aboriginal names recalls an
interesting event in the history of Tasmania. Gov-
ernor Arthur spent £30,000 trying to subdue the
native tribes who were making life a misery to the
settlers. For all the good he did he
might as well have thrown the money
into the Derwent. The story of Rob-
inson, who went as an arbiter, un-
armed, among these tribes and
brought them to reason, is well
known, When he succeeded, in 1831,
in taming the Big River abos., who
had been the terror of the island,
Arthur decided to give the tribe a
reception in Hobart Town. They
were brought to Government House,
and as they entered the grounds
Arthur ordered a brass band to strike
up the National Anthem. The Big
River warriors howled with terror.
Some of them made for the fence.
Some stampeded and plunged into the
Derwent, whilst the rest crowded
round Robinson with entreaties to
save them. Only with the greatest
difficulty could his Ex. pacify them. For sub-
duing this tribe Arthur gave Robinson £4OO.

“Bootawa”: “N.F.” (B. 17/10/’18) writes
or a Moreton Bay fig-tree sending a root straight
down to the ground 25 feet from a fork of a gum-
tree. In the orushes of the North Coast (N.S.W.)
hundreds of fig-trees of enormous size can be seen
encircling large tree-stems with their roots, and
these trees may remain green for years but are
doomed as food for the strangling parasite. There
is a giant on my property here at Manning River
which has roots 50 to .50 feet in length and averag-
ing six feet m girth, reaching down to the ground
from the main barrel of the tree and afterwards
going a distance of 150 feet to where they reach
water. As kids we used to get a lot of fun by
cutting these hanging roots off at the ground, tying
a loop-knot large enough to sit or place our feet in
and swinging from one side of a gully to the other.
Roots about the diameter of a gas-pipe suit the
purpose. Incidentally, I think some commer-
cial use might be found for the white gum which
exudes from the fig when cut with an axe. When
it first leaks out it is like milk, but if kept it
thickens and clears like transparent glue. Might
be a rubber substitute there.
THE DEBTS OF ART.
ACTOR: “Ah, Madam, we owe a lot to Shalsyeare.”
Landlady; “As which I am aweer of. My terms trill be strictly in advance."
“‘Bert R.” : He was one of that most
desirable class of immigrant—the English fanner
with money. I was showing him round Melbourne,
and he crashed along with me in boots so heavy that
they made mine look like dancing-pumps. By-and-
bye lie began to knock-up, so I took him over Princes
Bridge to the Alexandra Gardens, thinking he would
take the tombstones off and rest his feet, but he
showed no inclination to do so. “The city pavements
do tire one,” I ventured. “Ye-es,” he sighed. “I’d
be all right if I had my heavy boots on. I’m not
used to light ones like these.”
* * » *
“Pick” : Here is a home scheme for propa-
gating seedlings of gum and other native trees that
cannot be transplanted. Get a stout thistle stalk
6in. long. Bore out the pith and plug the lower end.
Fill the cavity with soil similar to that in which
the parent tree grows, but, to prevent caking, mix
the earth liberally with fine sand. When the little
fellow has sprouted, without disturbing the thistle
stalk, plant him where it is intended he shall per-
manently reside. Beyond watering and a protecting
guard fence very little attention will be needed, and
real Australians will be employed for ornamentation
instead of the sorrowful pines, leaf-shedding poplars
and other imported vegetables.
* * * *
“0 Goral”: Got this tip the other day
fioru a .....ring missionary. If your lugger-sail
rips and needles are out, get hold of one of the wire-
openers supplied with small tins of sardines, straigh-
ten it out, file one end to a point and there you
are—couldn’t have anything better.
* * * *
“Johno”: Australia’s farthest-north citi-
zens of discolor display “arm shells” to show that
they haven’t missed the main chance. These, which
are found on the reef 3 in Torres Strait, are conical,
varying in size from a few inches up to nearly a
foot, with black rings circling 1 round. When
cleaned and cut down they are worn as bracelets,
arm-rings, etc., or the flat end may be polished and
suspended round the neck. The New Guinea people
favor them largely, and will pay well in solid cash
for them when they have it. Usually they are used
in barter. One shell will buy a good-sized canoe and
much cargo in addition to sago, spears, etc. A distant
islander anxious to buy a canoe sends his shell to a
neighboring island of the same group. Then it is
passed on until it reaches New Guinea. When the
canoe is sent down it goes to each island where
the shell was handled, being “broken in” before
being, passed to the proper owner—a process involv-
ing sometimes a year or two. Another item of ex-
change in return for these shells is the New Guinea
drum. There is a tale that a philanthropic co. in
Thursday Island, with a view to encouraging local
industry amongst the islanders, offered a nigger a
shilling apiece for every arm-shell brought in.
What,” said the guileless child of nature, “give
me pfella one bob, and you passem that shell to
New Guinea man for five pound! No plurry fear.”
“D.D.” : One returned soldier’s luck is out.
He invested most of his small capital in a bee-farm
on the Kurrajong range, near Richmond (N.S.W.),
and settled down to nurse a lame leg, tend his bees,
grow a few vegetables and enjoy a solitary life.
Three months passed. Then one night, as Bill lay on
his bed reading, he spied a snake poking his head
through a hole in the hessian ceiling. lie grabbed a
handy gun as the reptile apologised and withdrew.
In the hope that the visitor would re-appear, Bill
trained the weapon on the hole and waited; but the
snake was in no hurry. Waiting became intolerable,
and Bill blazed at the hole. The ceiling was imme-
diately alight, the slab walls and bark roof quickly
caught and the hut was reduced to ashes. The bee-
hives were nearby, and the flames melted the honey
and bees in a hopeless mass. The fate of the snake
is unknown and Bill left next day.
AT THE TOILET GLEB.
“A bloke was tellin ’ me the fellers in the
trenches didn’t wash sometimes fer a
month.”
"The millingtry otighter he ashamed of their-
selves lettin' ’em get into that condi-
tion.”
“Nymboida”: Saw an exciting fight be-
tween a 12-foot carpet-snake and a kangaroo-dog.
It was thrilling to see the snake held and shaken by
his neck till his tail could come to his rescue, when
the dog would let go the head and grab the vacant
end. Then the carpet would try to bite him, so
the mong. had to leave the tail and grab the neck
again. After half an hour of setting to partners
the dog was getting puffed, so the spectators fin-
ished Axminster. The bite of the carpet-snake is
not venomous, but it is good for a pup.

THE ROAD TO BOWRAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Out of dull bracken brown wide eyes look up;
And under every wilding sunset tree
Moss-kissed and all forlorn, the buttercup
Sighs low, and turns her face up wistfully.
The white-rimmed violet bows down anew,
As through the moonlight-colored gum-tree aisles
Pale eventide, in silence, zoned in dew,
Batches the last light fading miles on miles.
Far up the disappearing trees that pour
Like water down the sky, the “Gib’s** gaunt might
Moui ns his lost brothers by a broken shore- —•
Ilis wardensliip of day and storm-rent night.
Wan evening smiles, and as the bush mists fade
And grope with hazy fingers through the deep
Brown bracken’s maze, like eyes of trembling jade.
The leaves all turn, gleam once, and fall asleep.
(And in the bracken, kind brown eyes are bright.)
It needs not rose-white noon to see the way,
Nor harvest moon nor dawn nor any light.
The red road dips to Bowral. Tired day
Speeds on across the “Gib,” and silken dark
Comes down and hides the world. (Brown eyes are
bright.)
Some birds still mutter in the trees. And hark!
The first faint call of lightfoot, radiant Night.

Director Hornaby, of the New York Zoo,
states that one Ellis S. Joseph lately brought to New
lork from Australia the largest collection of rare
mammals, birds and reptiles that was ever landed in
the country. Part of the importation has been pur-
chased by the New York Zoological Society, and part
by the Philadelphia Zoological Society, while other
purchases are proceeding. Hornaby states that the
total kangaroo collection at the garden under his
charge is now the most extensive in the world. But
with the ’roos rapidly decreasing here, it mav be
necessary m the future for Australia to import ’’roos

"An' I say, dear frien's. I'm hat glod I'm saved I could drive this stick fair through
Ida D. : The original name of Lanyon
station (in the Quearrbrvan district of N. S. Wales)
is Gijilite, “good camping-ground,” that is, plenty
of duck and fish. Parties of blacks used to camp
in an angle of the river and make “pills” from the
inner bark of a tree which grows near by. After
swallowing them fish became stupefied and floated
on the surface. Many of the Monaro tribes made
yearly visits to the mountains and became fat and
sleek from feeding on the huge Bugong moths,
returning to the lower grounds with their dilly-
bags full of them. Jidginbilla, in the Queanbeyan
district, is “the snow-capped hill,” and Tallagandra
is “the crows’ gathering place.” Cuppacuambalo—
the spelling is now altered—is the “junction of the
big and the little rivers,” i.e., the Murrumbidgee and
the Gudgenby. Note the resemblance in this name
to Bombala, much farther south, which means
“meeting of the waters.”

Fiank R. : I’d like to know how many
miles an alligator can travel overland. Whilst walk-
ing- along a N.Q. beach some yearb back I saw a
’gator leave the water and proceed inland. I fol-
his tracks, which led to a lagoon four miles
away. The wanderings of alligators from rivers and
sea beaches to inland waterholes is responsible for the
mysterious disappearance of many a station-hand and
swagman. These unfortunates have decided upon a
swim in what seemed to be a safe place, and the
recently-arrived brute has done the rest. After h e avv
rains at Inkerman (N.Q.) in 1908 several dry water-
became flooded, and the people who dwelt in the
Vicinity spent hours almost daily swimmino- in the
cool and clear water. One afternoon the clothing of
two well-known station-hands was found on the banks
of a shallow lagoon. The missing men wer e both
good swimmers, and this added to the mystery of
their disappearance. The lagoon was dragged for two
days without any result. A week later an aboriginal
observed tracks leading from th c lagoon in the direc-
tion of the sea, six miles away. An armed party
followed and caught up with the ’gater a mile from
the beach. When shot and cut open the boots, belts
and pocket-knives of the missing men were found.
Binghi has often told me that the saurians have been
known to travel 10 to 12 miles overland, but I’ll not
vouch for this, as he is an awful liar.
“Barcoo”: For first place in birds’ “big
nrsts” the manager of Holbourne Island—2o miles out
from Bowen (N.Q.) —gives the dimensions of a scrub-
turkej's nest which he carefully measured. The
mound was 75ft. long, 49ft. wide and 12ft. high.
Those scrub-turkeys are particularly plentiful along
the Bananaland coast. A bag of 50 or 60 to one gun
for an afternoon’s shooting is not uncommon. It’s
not sport. The flesh of the fowl is good eating but very
game.. It is a common sight to see up to 30 pairs of
the birds dangling on a pole over the shoulders of a
scrub-turkey hunter, being peddled from house to
house m the bigger coastal towns at 3s. the pair.
* * *
“Eddyson”: Old Charley Marsh put his
whole heart and soul into the five head of stamps he
erected at Mallow Flats. He was his own engineer
and his own builder, and the result was a grotesque
little null driven by a wheezy old 1 portable, and con-
structed with such masterly incompetence that when
in full swing she seemed to jig ecstatically like an
amorous bower-bird, and passers of a humorous turn
would pause by the way to whistle a lilting Irish air,
which brought Charley darting from his engine, hurl-
ing quartz and squeaking raspy profanity, for Charley
had an amazing admiration for his battery, and
regarded it as the finest evidence of local enterprise
trie Flats had yet achieved. But in a very few months
the mill earned a wretched and ruinous reputation as
the best gold-waster ever, miners declaring on their
oath and honor such were the facilities for escape in
Marsh’s mill that there was more gold in the tailings
than had ever been in the quartz. Then public crush-
ing suddenly ceased, and Charley was left with his
lovely little mill lying idle. But great was the
old man’s faith. He pegged out the Pipeclav Rise as
an alluvial proposition, and tackling it with a barrow
set systematically to work putting it through his
battery. The Rise had aways yielded a weight or so
to the acre, with just a chance of something good
somewhere in the mass, and Charley, acting as his
own laborer, engine-driver, battery-feeder and blanket-
washer hoped to win out. Early in the adventure
the mill-owner had leased tailing-rights to Ah Kit,
who had rigged a set of sluice-boxes below the race
running from Marsh s tables, and was preserving a
marked Oriental calm in the face of public vitupera-
tion arising from the belief that to his share fell all
the gold that ever went under Charlei-’s stampers.
The Pipeclay venture was a dead failure. Charley
March didn’t extract gold enough to pay for engine-
grease, as he confided to Keightley. “She’s the
prettiest mill in aller Victoria,” he lamented, “ ’ n ’ I
gotter shut her down just because these ’ere pig-
eaded brutes would rather cart all the way to
Peewee than paternise local enterprise.” But the mill
was not long idle. When next Keightley passed a
week later she was working off her famous Irish
reel with undiminished vigor. “Hello 1” suVl
Keightley, “still at if? I thought you were
through.” “No fear,” replied the delighted mill-
°" ner. I m not shut down, and I’m not goin’ to be
Fact is, I’m doin’ pertickler well, makin’ me 10 quid

“John Q.” ; After the hot day the pub-
keeper and his half-dozen boarders were on the
pub verandah enjoying the cool evening breeze.
Lp from the creek at the foot of the hill came
sounds of the bullocky’s waggon. Suddenly the
temperature of the cool breeze rose to 119 deg. and
a string of boiling epithets hurtled round the
boarders’ ears. The three young ladies hurriedly
withdrew to vamp ragtime on the piano. “Bill’s
in trouble again,” said the pub-keeper. “It’s a
steep pinch down there.” Then the breeze bore
along this masterpiece: “ Wait till I get my noo
wipandle, if I don’t flog you till your eyeballs
drop out, dance around your 'orns, and fight down
your backs like cats, yous can yoke me in!”
* * *
“Ragar”: “Bouragi” (B. 22/8/18) writes
of the giant frog of Surinam, which allows his
missus to lay her eggs on his broad back. Is this
any relation to the Surinam toad (Pipa monstrosa )
of Brazil? The female of this batrachian, after
producing her eggs in the usual manner, backs up
and allows the male to push the spawn on to her
back, where it sticks fast. She then proceeds to
the nearest swamp and submerges in the mud. An
eruptive inflammation then sets up in the skin of the
hack, into which the eggs become absorbed, and
remain buried there until hatched. Once hatched
hey quickly develop, and are soon turned adrift
to fend for themselves. It is dad who flits, and
poor old mother has to shoulder the load as usual,
and having no tongue—a peculiarity of this batra-
chian she hasn’t even the satisfaction of telling
the old rotter what she thinks of him.

“Tom Yee”; “Lin” (B. 14/11/’18)* seems
to know little about rabbits, but he is not the only
one that thinks the does have a litter'about once a
fortnight. I have bred more rabbits in England than
“Lin” , would care to eat in a month of .Sundays, from
the Flemish giant, which goes anywhere up to 131 b.
weight, down to the silver-grey, black-and-tan, Dutch
or the prick-eared grey, which are about 4slb. weight
and I never had a doe that took less than 31 days’
from the time she tipped, and she would have
nothing to do with the old man under nine days after
she littered. By the way, a doe will start breeding at
three months. b
D.”: I wanted a bucket of water for my
horse. “It’s jist as well not to be disobligin’,” Rope
said, especially if it don’t cost too much. People
round here have had their stacks burned through no:
bein’ obligin’ enough. Look at what happened to
'' 1 Imot, too. It was the summer afore last, ’n’ the
country was ez dry as the horse what died in ’nine-
teen- undred. A pure, haggard sort of feller tripped
up to Wilmot’s door, ’n’ leaned on the jamb, ’n’
coifed ’n’ said he: ‘Please, would you lend a man a
bucket ot water?’ ‘No, I wouldn’t,’ Wilmot replied,
lhe feller shifted on to the other jamb, ’n’ sez he:
You might lend a man a bucket of water.’ ‘Then
agen I mightn’t,’ sez Wilmot. ‘l’ve got to cart every
drop of water I use.’ ‘ ’Tain’t decent to refuse a
bloke the loan of a drop of water,’ said the bloke-
n’ it wouldn’t hurt you to bo obligin’.’’ ‘Get out"
sez Wilmof; and the man got. Nex’ morning when
YYilmot got up he found that man, head down in his
iron tank, drowned. On the tank was a notice
writ in charcoal: ‘Nex’ time a pore bloke wants a
bucket ot water, give it to him. God knows, it’s
ittie enough.’ So,” said Roper in conclusion, “though
I can t spare you the water raeself, I can oblige you
} tell in you where most likely you can get it Trv
the white house over the bridge—that’s WilmotV’
* *
"W andi”: It’s in the early morning that
you get the best idea of the vocal wealth of the bush
though many birds, as the parrot tribe, revel with
equal zest in the sunset hour. With these the passing
of day is th e time of aerial frolic, of joyous inter<-
course and sporttveness on the grass, and of gay gam-
bols among the boughs; but in the fresh, sweet morn-
ing air most of the feathered creatures are active and
noisy. It is a time of business and play, of greetings
and chatter, of song and mating and nest-building.
‘Om tl,, ‘ little tomtits to the shy lyre-bird there is
about them an air of urgency and importance even in
then- most frivolous actions, and an irrepressible jov-
anec in the glory of the new day—providing it isn’t
wet. In their engaging habits and movements, in
then- coats of beauty, their chatter and song and
flight, they add something to the leaven of life that
makes them worth our care and protection even con id
w c easily dispense with their service in the destruc-
tion of insect pests.

HEARNE’S
BRONCHITIS
= CURE =
IS THE FINEST REMEDY IN THE WORLD FOR
COUGHS. CROUP AND COLDS.
THOSE who have had occasion to take Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure are
astonished at its Wonderful Healing Power. Sufferers from Bron-
chitis, Cough, Croup, Pain or Soreness in the
Chest, Hoarseness, Difficulty of Breathing, Stuffiness,
Asthma, experience delightful and rapid relief. This
medicine is particularly valuable to those who are sub-
ject to Colds on the Chest, as it Strengthens the Lungs,
and renders them less susceptible. It is most comfort-
ing in allaying Irritation in the Throat, and giving
Strength to the Voice, and for this reason is thoroughly
appreciated by Clergymen, Public Speakers and
Singers. It does not allow a Cough to become
Chronic, and in this respect is absolutely indis-
pensable in preventing a cold from developing
into Bronchitis, Asthma, Pneumonia, Pleurisy,
or Consumption. No house should be with-
out a bottle of this Wonderful Remedy, as
taken at the first indication of a Cold, a
dose or two is generally sufficient. A
Cold should always be “nipped in the
bud,” or serious illness may follow.

The Fall of a Rechablte Empire
From Autocracy to Bolshevism, by Baron
p. Graevenitz. is the best condensed story up
to date of the landslide of Russia. It carries
the narrative to the beginning of 1918, when
the gigantic muddle or treason or madness of
Lenin, Trotsky and co. was in full blast.
Russia went into the war as a teetotal
empire—the biggest Prohibition (newly pro-
hibited) empire that ever buckled on the full
armor of the Reehabite. It was in the main
religious, after a profoundly-ignorant fashion,
whereas the Prussian enemy was a gross
materialist; but then most deeply religious
nations are ignorant. Also, it was probably no
more immoral than the average, whatever the
average may be. Its soldiers were as brave
as men could be, and were like sands on the
seashore for numbers. Its Czar was no more
autocratic than the Kaiser-King of Germany
and Prussia, but he was a shambling auto-
crat, and for the ruler who shambles on the
Day of Judgment there is no Hereafter.
Also, he was clumsy, and lacked the hypo-
critical garment of Liberalism. The Duma
was less a burlesque Parliament than the
Prussian one, and not much worse than the
llun imperial Reichstag, but the German
legislative bodies were well-drilled machines
of the Macedonian phalanx type, while the
Duma was a shepherdless dock of legislative
recruits. Railways, roads, munition-factories,
organisation were far behind the times. The
Russian officers were a kindly lot by com-
parison with the Germans and Austrians, but
they were too few, and though there were
brilliant exceptions, their courflge and polite
accomplishments didn’t fill the bill. When a
crisis came the Czar flopped like Louis XVI.,
only he flopped in the midst of war, whereas
Louis did it before the war. The mild revo-
lutionists —principally Kerensky, the opium-
eater —followed as in France. The Jacobins
rushed the position, also as in France. Then
the ways parted and the parallel ended, for
while the Jacobins were inspired by an
unquenchable love for their country, the One
Big Union of Russia was actuated or
thought it was by a fuzzy-headed love of
mankind and a muddled desire to be bro-
thers. Its leaders invented “peace by nego-
tiation without annexations or indemnities,”
and the results to their country were the
worst kinds of chaos. They had all the regu-
lar One Big Union ideas about taking over
all industries, and conscripting capital, and
making the land the property of the people.
But the workshops mostly collapsed within
a few weeks through want of manage-
ment, and everything was broken into
dust and fragments for want of a Car-
not or St. Just or Robespierre to superin-
tend the division of things. Aristocrats
weren’t executed in order, but just anyhow.
When 12 muddy excited people are told in a
general way that a Babylonish garment is
their property, the result is apt to be 11
bruised people and one person escaping over
the horizon with a button, the rest of the
article being rent and lost in the skirmish.
So far, however, it can't be said that Bol-
shevism hasn’t paid the boss Bolsheviks in
some kind of currency. Lenin, Trotsky and
co., instead of being lurky, surreptitious and
unfinaneial malcontents, have had a brief
dazzling spell of power, and the possession
of power for good or evil, with or without
loot, is a mania with a certain type of mind.
The two dictators were, for a moment, more
absolute than kaisers or sultans. Appar-
ently they had in them that ambition which
drives men to be Napoleons and Mahomets
and Alexanders, also aldermen, popes of the
Borgia type, leaders of the push. Neros, Mad
Mullahs, Mormon prophets, burners of the
temple of Ephesus, Jack the Rippers, or in-
ventors of a new sin. In a temporary, per-
ishable sort of way they achieved their pur-
pose. The men who pushed down the world’s
one Prohibition empire and made room for
free distillation at least Did Things. They
didn’t pull the affair down like the unpracti-
cal Samson, so that it would fall on their
heads. The jerry-built edifice was pushed, or
shoved or blown upon. (George Allen and
Unwin, Limited. London, are the publishers.)
The Inky Way
“Frank Reid” : Running an official maga-
zine for Billjim is not all beer and counter-
lunch. Take, for instance, the Kta Ora
Coo-ee, the digger’s sheet in Egypt and
Palestine. I had been planning the publish-
ing of the magazine for 18 months, hut
chasing Abdul towards Aleppo offered little
time for journalistic work. When a severe
attack of malaria placed me on the unfit list,
I approached A.I.F. Headquarters, Cairo,
about the idea, and was fortunate to meet
in the Commandant, Rieut.-Col. D. Fulton,
a one-time Adelaide pressman, and he offered
me every assistance. David Barker, of
Anzao Book fame, who had just returned
from the Mesopotamian front, offered to
attend to the art side of the publication.
The high cost of printing paper presented
a serious barrier for a time, but eventually
a contract was signed with a Cairo printing
firm, and it was decided to start off with
10,000 copies monthly. The third issue of
the Coo-ee saw the circulation raised to
15,000. Just about this time someone sent
along a yarn about a gay Billjim and a
Bedouin girl. It was only an ordinary sort
of yarn, and it crept quietly into print. The
wowser element of the A.1.F., after raising
a howl that was heard at the half-way pub
between Damascus and Aleppo, demanded
the editor’s instant dismissal or execution
or something. The committee of the maga-
zine took days to think the matter over, and
eventually it was decided to give Billjim a
magazine which would not raise a blush on
the face of the most God-fearing padre. It
was a pity, as a mighty lot of good Billjim
humor was lost by the pious change.
Thomas J. Symons explains:—
The paragraph in B. 28/11/’lB in reference to
myself and George Robertson and Co. is at variance
with the facts. In the first place, there are two of
us, and I—T. J. Symons —was publisher for George
Robertson for many years, and am now taking over
a number of that house’s publications. My brother —
J. B. Symons—has purchased Robertson’s Book Club
Library, and transferred it to new premises in
Collins-street, Melb. In regard to my old firm’s method
of publishing, I have scores of times refused to accept
publications at author’s risk and cost. During my
connection with the firm we published about 200
books, totalling, with repfiilfs, over half a million
copies, and of these only 18 books' were at the
author’s risk. Personally I do not like —and do not
want —this class of work, and am quite prepared to
sink or swim upon my own judgment as to public
demand.
“Camelero’’: Badly wounded somewhere
near Damascus, Fred Ford, a well-known
type-snatcher in Bananaland. Years ago I
was working in a small N.Q. printing-office
when Ford, accompanied by a swag, hap-
pened along. Things were slack and the- boss
refused to give Ford a start. The swaginan
sat on the steps and asked the boss if he had
any objections to him having dinner before
proceeding on the journey. The boss didn’t
mind, but he nearly fell off his chair when
he saw Ford start to devour a piece of raw
steak. “Ob, for God’s sake, man, start on
that heap of pied type. I can’t stand anyone
going without decent tucker.’’ Ford worked
for six months in that office, and he told me
afterwards that few newspaper owners re-
fused him work after he produced the raw
steak.
“Carrawobitty”: Regarding “Simon’s”
par (B. 14/11/’IS) on newspaper pro-
prietors turned out at Gus Miller’s
Cooma Express office. Simon makes a mis-
take when he says that Godfrey Wigg and
«T. McCann are proprietors of the Forbes
(N.S.W.) Advocate. That Western journal
was founded and is still owned by G. W.
Brownhill, who returned from the war at
the latter end of last year and wrote some
good campaigning yarns.
“Bill Bowyang”: “E.S.S.” correctly states
(B. 7/11/T8) that the Australian book is
not pushed in the way that English and
American books are. Take the case of Major
Oliver Ilogue (“Trooper Bluegum”). Bi 11-
jim on the other side considers his book,
“Trooper Bluegum at the Dardanelles,’’ the
real thing in Anzac write-ups; yet I do not
believe that a copy can be purchased in
Sydney. The book for several weeks was a
best-seller in Egypt; yet when Hogue wrote
to a well-known Sydney firm requesting them
to stock the book, they ordered a dozen copies
from the publishers! Hogue altered the
order to 100 copies, and on arrival in Sydney
the consignment sold out in a week. Despite
this, further copies were not ordered. With
a few exceptions, local booksellers do not
care to handle war books by Australian
writers; but the works of Pat McGill, lan
Hay, Fred Palmer and others can be pur-
chased by the drayload.
A Satchel of Books
Frenzied Fiction, by Stephen Leacock (London,
John Lane). The rather thin vein of humor which
made the author of “Literary Lapses” popular has
just about run out. The latest volume from his
pen makes very dull reading, with just an occasional
whimsical touch to save it from utter futility.
The Smiths in War-time, by Keble Howard (Lon-
don, John Lane). A readable book with some fun
of the English variety.
Glenmoran: A Story of Donegal, by Patrick
Mac Gill (Herbert Jenkins, London). In spite of
all the praises which England has lavished on
Mac Gill, he is not a good painter of Irish life and
character. No realist with his camera closely
focussed upon the sordid details of the life of the
poor can be. One chapter from James Stephens
when in his most breezy and extravagant mood is
worth a hundred books of / this kind. Mac Gill’s
realism is poor art and his own people have little
to thank him for.
The German Pirate, by “Ajax” (C. Arthur Pearson,
London). A little book telling of the German
U-boats and their ways. Readable as a record of
the Teuton’s shame.
Five Little Bush Girls, by E. Lee Ryan (Aus-
tralasian Authors’ Agency, Melbourne). A pleasant
and thoroughly readable little yarn about an Aus-
tralian family. The youngsters are of the right
kind and weil drawn. A book that should go big
both in bush and town.
The Higher Powers of Mind and Spirit is by
Ralph Waldo Trine —obviously called after a man
whose names shouldn’t be borrowed by all and
sundry. Not that the present writer is all, but he
is rather sundry. The United States produces the
ordinary varieties of literature and in addition two
special varieties. One is the work on mechanics or
science which is more intensely earnest than the
average. The other is the rather dreamy, rather
hazy, rather disjointed and commodious volume
about the uplift of the soul. The Higher Powers,
etc., is of that sort, in 239 pages of clearly-printed
uplift. Literature of this class deals largely in
comparatives. It cultivates the higher powers;
tends to nobler thoughts, and advocates a wider
outlook, brighter hopes, loftier aspirations and
deeper insight. Naturally its goal is the Better
Land. There is not a word to be said against its
grammar, its moral purity or its good intentions,
and the paper and binding are irreproachable. But
even a ton of it leads to nothing very definite. On
pp 77-8-9 the author of Higher Powers, etc., gives
some clear and highly interesting points about the
origin of the New Testament, but they are a quota-
tion from a man with a less dreamy and poetic
name than Ralph Waldo Trine—plain, direct Henry
Drummond. The book may safely be given to the
voung, if one happens to have it about him and
the young are in the vicinity, but it isn’t necessary
to run after them with it. (G. Bell and Sons, Ltd.,
London.)
Hew Zealanders in Samoa, by L. P. Leary..O' iHiam
Heinemann), is typical of the kind pub-
lishers produced while the war raged. There will be
less of it in future —and the less the better. Leary s
yarn is merely about the crowd that rushed to
Samoa and eventually rushed away again—about them
getting sick on the trip and about the boisterous
humor of the journey and the regimental newspaper
and so on. He really had no material to go un—or
at any rate none that had not been done to death in
the newspapers. As for the dusky maiden and the
languorous beauty of the island—well, a master hand
combed all there was to be got out of that long ago.
Business, Robbery, etc.
America’s decentralising system of killing
and packing its meat in the districts where
the stock is grown (B. 21/11/’IS) might be
applied with profit to plenty of Australian
producing-industries besides that of stock"
raising. The big meat-packeries in the
supplying far-distant populations with tresn
meat by means of refrigerator-cars, set an
example which was presently followed by
other enterprising persons for the handling
of all manner of perishables. Take the com-
mon or garden French-bean and similai in-
tense cultures. At present, in Australia,
these handy and compact vegetables, which
bring an excellent return if planted scienti-
fically, are grown close to the great cities, as a
rule. They can be raised at least as well in
the baekblocks on watered land at £lO an
acre as on market-garden land at £lOO, jet
for lack of adequate transportation “country
beans always sell at a much lower rate than
the outer-suburban article, being wilted be-
fore they reach the city. The same thing may
be said of almost every other sort of perish-
able produce in this country. In the U-S., if
there is a glut of “string” beans m one State,
the controlling organisations send their sur-
plus across-country to collar the market else-
where ; and the same principle is applied to
strawberries and hen carcases and fresh her-
rings and all manner of foodstuffs that in
Australia go to the tip in tons for lack of a
market. The continually-starved state of the
vegetable-markets in Melbourne, for instance,
offers every inducement to the man with
cheap, good land to plant a considerable side-
line of perishables, to compete with the pro-
duce of the largely-Chinese market-gardener
in the suburbs ; but, until the Itailways De-
partment decides to encourage such men by
providing an ample, welLadvertised refrige-
rator-service on all its main lines, Melbourne
will continue to pay fancy prices for its daily
greenstuff, or do without. To a vast extent
Melbourne just, does without; and this, of
course, being bad for the liver, is also bad for
the national efficiency. No doubt the Rail-
ways Department would be more efficient if
it ate more herbage, which seems its natural
diet, anyway.

“Snips”: The wail of “Plumber” (B.
14/.11/T8) at the charge of 2s. lOd. per lb.
wholesale for solder (50 p.c. tin, 50 p.c.
lead) would be less doleful perhaps if he
didn’t buv at the wrong shop. My experi-
ence in this State (Vic.) doesn’t, exactly
proVe there is a combine amongst whole-
salers to exploit users, In May, TB, con-
sidering 2s. (id. per lb. at Melbourne the limit
for the alloy, I changed my firm and bought
in July at Is. lid. (dinkum stuff, too) in
lots not less than lewt. September consign-
ments same price. At same time other quotes
ranged up to 2s. 4d. November invoice price
was Is. 1 Old.—though I’m not arguing this
purely Australian product is cheap at that.
Lieut.-Colonel “Dave” Fulton, of A.I.F.
Headquarters, Cairo, and one time a
good friend to Adelaide pressmen as
well as a clever writer on military
subjects, is threatening to do big things in
Palestine. Some time back lie suggested to
the Imperial authorities at Cairo that they
should plant wheat on the excellent agri-
cultural land around Gaza. Prior to the
war much of this land carried grain, which
was purchased by Buchanan’s of whisky
fame. Fulton’s scheme interested the VV ar
Office, and a commission toured Palestine
and inspected the most likely land. Result
was that two shiploads of agricultural im-
plements were despatched _ from Bngland,
and a few thousand Egyptian laborers are
now tilling the land. Colonel Fulton s sug-
gestion was that the native _ farmers be
formed into gangs, each of which would be
in charge of a Light Horseman who had
been wheat-farming in Australia prior to the
war. Perhaps the despatch of our mounted
men to Gallipoli will interfere with this
scheme, and Tommy farmers may take their
place as overseers on the military wheat
farms. If so, it’s a good wager that they
will not get the same amount of work out
of the Gyppo that Billjim would.
“The Bagman’’: Quite agree with the
pointed remarks of “Y.Z.” in a recent
Bulletin regarding the robbers who take
you down over washing-soda. . But why will
not Victoria develop its own resources in this
direction? Up in the north-west corner,
alongside the railway, is Lake Tyrell, pro-
ducing acres and acres of salt and allied pro-
ducts, and yet they are barely touched. Have
heard it stated as a reason that the local pro-
duction-fostering Governments made the
freights so stiff that experiments wouldn’t
pay. Don’t know about that; but I do know
that the cockies in the locality were paying
big prices for salt carted round from South
Australia, some hundreds of miles per boat,
then freighted up nearly 300 miles by train,
when all the while they had what they needed
at their back door. There are deposits of
other material right alongside the aforemen-
tioned lake which could be headed into a big
industry if the Government would give only
one-eighth the encouragement to it that is
given to mining.
“D.F.”: In the final clearing-up the big
railway accident at Campania, over two
years ago, cost the Speck £18,198 in com-
pensation—not quite enough to eat up the
£20,000 improvement in the railway revenue
this year. Two passengers lost their false
teeth, and it cost £l4 to start them biting
again.
“Bill Bowyang” : Nippon doesn’t miss much.
Fake scarabs, jewellery and other gimcracks
which, prior to the war used to be made in
Birmingham and sold to Egyptian tourists,
are now being imported from Japan. Twelve
months back two Japanese visited Cairo and
made inquiries about the kind of goods that
would find a ready sale. Result was that
within six months the ancient land was
flooded with beer, matches, printing paper,
cutlery and other things all branded “Made
in Japan.” By the way, I’ve just spent a
month’s furlough in a N.Q. sugar district,
and the first cane-lcnife I picked up was
branded with Nippon’s trade-riiark.

Judge “ Adamax” Roofing by the company it keeps. Its selection
use on the foremost big jobs of Australia offers clear proof of
superior quality.
As a result of such severe competitive tests 120 miles ol
“ Adamax” Roofing have been used by the Imperial
Government on various Wool and Wheat Depots through-
out Australia—ordered because “Adamax” has proved
itself to be “The Best Roofing that Money can Buy,”
5000 sq. yds. of “Adamax” used on C.S.A. Mine
Buildings at Kandos, N. S. Wales.
“Adamax” is the ideal Mine Building
Roofing because it resists Acids,
Gases or Chemical Fumes, and
because the elements have no
ill-effect on it.

(7) SIDE WALLS. —Realising the severe work
tyres are called upon to do in the country,
we have placed a great thickness of rubber on
the side walls, preventing water from entering,

Joseph Francis MacMahon, brother of the
late James and Charlie MacMahon, who died
from influenza at Auckland on November 22,
was 55. The brothers held the lease of the
Old Opera House, Melbourne (now the
Tivoli Theatre) when “Paul Jones” was
first staged at that house by the late George
Musgrove. The cast on that occasion in-
cluded Nellie Stewart, Marion Burton, Aggie
Ivelton, “Teddy” Leech and G. 11. Snazelle.
Afterwards the trio was interested in touring
the smalls of M.L. with dramatic companies,
but eventually they drifted back again to the
picture business. For the past seven years
Joe, successfully managed the Queen’s
Picture Theatre and the Princess Picture
Theatre, at Auckland.
Cinquevalli (his real name was Emile Otto
Paul Braun) left £26,217.
TOO HOT.
THE MANAGER: “This influenza scare doesn’t
seem to have made much difference to
us —house full every night."
THE STAR: “No influenza germ could live
within a mile of this show —they hate
warmth."
The London comic-opera boom has been
further increased by the revival of Stephens
and Solomon's “Red Hussar,” which was
originally done at the Lyric in November,
*B9, with Marie Tempest, Ben Davies and
Hayden Coffin in the cast. All three
are still grease-painting. The only
Stephens-Solomon opera done in Australia
was “Billee Taylor,” which fizzled out after
three weeks at Meib. Royal in ’B2. (Wil-
liamson, in an interview, said that the Firm
had dropped £lOOO over it—a lot in those
days.) The piece was revived again in ’BO
for Billy Elton to make his Sydney debut at
the Royal, and in February of ’B7 it was
repeated at Meib. Princess’s. Nellie Stewart
was the prima donna, and in the cast were
Armes Beaumont, Howard Vernon (who in-
troduced the opera to Maoriland in ’S3) and
Harwood.
“Theorbo”: Leslie Hoffman, just appointed
conductor of the South Sydney Baud, is a
remarkable Australian musician. lie is only
28 and entirely self-
taught. He started
at 11 in the band
of St. Augustine’s
Orphanage, Gee-
long. At 17 he was
conductor, and in
four years more
he pushed the band
ahead so that it
went to the Bal-
larat competition
and won the Aus-
tralian champion-
ship against the
bes t ban d s in
the Commonwealth.

“Jack North” ; So in the latest and most
promising picture we are, according to
“Hawk,” being given another proof of the
misdirection of local energy and capital (B.
12/12/T8). That superior critic seizes
upon the circumstance that Snowy Baker,
after spending some months among the film-
makers of Los Angeles, proposes to re-film
certain portions of “The Lure of the Bush”
before offering it for sale in America. No
doubt he is acting on skilled advice, though
whether it is disinterested may be ques-
tioned. ITis cinema man (Franklyn Barrett)
knew all about adventitious aids, but Baker
was resolved to uphold his fine reputa-
tion as an athlete, and wisely, in my judg-
ment, used no devices in the performance of
his hazardous and remarkable feats. The
result was a picture which has not only
broken all Australian records for a local
film, besides beating the figures of several
big imported features, but it has received
the approval of the fight and horse fans,
whose name in this country is legion. The
answer to “Hawk” is given by the receipts,
and by the fact that the picture has settled
down to a money-making stride which will
carry well into 1919. It is to be sold in
England ; it is certain of a warm welcome in
France; and when revised to suit American
tastes will doubtless sell well in that coun-
try. The “capitalists” concerned are very
well, thank you. They can do with as many
more “Lures” as can be provided. A few
more failures like the “Lure,” and picture-
play making will be firmly established in
this country.
“L.H.P.”; “C. H. Souter” asks (B.
14/11/T8) if dramatist Henry Hamilton,
lately dead, was ever in Australia. I think
not, as he gave up acting in ’BO, when Haw-
trey produced Hamilton’s strong drama
“Harvest” at the London Princess’s. It was
this piece which first upset poor Amy Roselle
and made her very difficult to manage ever
after. She played the heroine, a fine
“meaty” role, dominating every situation.
She had a catchword tag for the end of
every act—“ The time will come for har-
vest !” Undoubtedly she made a big stride
forward in the profession by her rendering of
the part; but it was difficult from that time
forth to get her to undertake any new part
that was not equally satisfactory to her. She
either refused the script or tried to insist
upon its being “written up.”
Xat Goodwin. Australia's old friend, now
in his 07th year, has been divorced by his
sixth wife, Margaret Moreland, a U.B.
actress. Nat’s first wife, Eliza \Y eathersly,
died 30 years ago; then came Nella Pease,
who divorced him; Maxine Elliott, whom he
divorced for desertion, and a few' days
later married Edna Goodrich, who in due
course induced the law to effect a break. If
Nat again slips into matrimony lm will be
the most-married mime in the U.S. At
present his tally is no better than that of
De Wolf Hopper, who at various times has
undertaken to love, honor and cherish Ella
Gardiner. Ida Mosher, Edna Wallace, Nellie
Bergen and Elda Curry.
“Billo”: Tell “Auss” (B. 5/12/TS), who
wrote describing a series of alleged happen-
ings during a performance of "Dick Turpin ’
by Cole’s Bohemians at Bendigo, that some-
one has been pulling his limb. I have played
with King Cole each time he has been in Ben-
digo, and no incident as ‘described ever hap-
pened in that or any other play staged by
him. The heroine in “Dick Turpin” does
not possess a brother, nor would any
“Bohie” ever be stuck because a revolver
missed fire. He generally has two or more.
Cole has played in Bendigo on six dif-
ferent occasions within the last nine years,
one season lasting for nine consecutive
months. I suggest that “Auss,” in future
pars, of this description, leaves the “u” out
of his pen-name.
A new Lauder yarn comes from Canada.
“Speak up, Harry; I can’t hear you, ’
observed a patron. “Ye would if ye paid a
wee bit more for your seat and came closer,”
was Henry’s reply.
“Monkbarns”: Re early performances of
“Fra Diavolo” and “The Bohemian Girl” in
Sydney. Beaumont’s first stage appearance
was in the latter city as Thaddeus in “The
Bohemian Girl.” Squires giving up the part
to him. Doubtless the tuneful old opera was
heard in Sydney and Melbourne from the
early co. of which Nellie Stewart's mother
and the Ilowson family were members. The
first Melbourne performance of “Fra
Diavolo” that I know of was with Madame
Carandini in the tenor part.
“F.” : It's about time that all actors com-
bined and started kicking against working
conditions that no self-respecting bricklayer
would tolerate for five minutes. A recent
case was settled out of court in which an
actor claimed two weeks’ salary and his
return fare from Melbourne. lie had been
engaged for the run of a certain piece and
concluding the Sydney run was shifted to
Melbourne. The piece, wasn’t a wonderful
hit, and a stopgap drama was put into re-
hearsal,. in which he was not given a part.
He was, therefore,
asked to walk about
the town for a fort-
night without pay. He
very naturally kicked
and demanded his re-
turn fare to his home
city. This was re-
fused, so so he paid it
himself and went
home. The manage-
ment contended that
he had broken his con-
tract, but the actor
issued a writ and got
his money in an hour
or two. But it will be
a long time before he
gets another engage-
ment. Five others
with less fight in their
make-up took the
knock and compro-
mised for a week’s
salary. Another in-
stance : A firm sent
out a company to play
the country towns.
They rehearsed for
three weeks, played
two and returned to
Sydney to “reorgan-
ise.” This was some
weeks ago. They are
still reor g a n ising.
Legally the mummers
can claim a fortnight’s
pay in lieu of notice ;
but none of them will
dare to do so for fear
of imperilling their
engagements, and

ing accounts they will have to survive on
“tick” and start their tour heavily in debt.
But the actors foolishly turned down the
proposal to form a union, so they have to
take what they are given.
“L.H.P.”: “Les Cloches de Corneville,”
played recently on a Sydney suburban stage,
makes one wonder if any of our Billjims in
France have got to Corneville. A London
pressman in the ’nineties pointed out that
the church of Corneville did not possess a
belfrey nor peal of bells. Marquis de la
llochethulon, the survivor of the family who
furnished the hero of the legend, at once got
to work to remedy this, and raised funds in
all parts of the world where Planquette's
work had been staged. The bells purchased
from the fund were cast by Paccard Bros.,
the founders of the big bell of Paris.
The inaugural ceremony took place in
September, 1899. The peal consists of 10
bells* which play the famous legend from
the opera. In recognition of the generous
response to the fund, each of the bells is
named after a contributing country or pro-
vince. The names are “La Normandie,”
Russian, Swede, American, Algerian. Savoy.
Auvergne, Cretan, Britisher and Saint Ger-
maine, after the name of the opera’s heroine.
Every year till war broke out in 1914 an
elaborate open-air performance of the opera
took place at Corneville. Hundreds of vil-
lagers were drilled for the chorus.
HIS TRIUMPH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“No art like that by which we live
Can bring the earnest artist more
In intimate connection with
The public that he caters for.
We actors, sir, in any case
Must meet our judges face to face.”
Maltravers deftly raised his beer
And balanced it upon his lip.
“This privilege is very dear.
For instance, on a recent trip
At Yam I did so edify
The men they bore me shoulder high.
“ ’Twas Belphegor I played. (You know
The splendid mountebank, of course?)
That was a truly noble show.
I finished wet, exhausted, hoarse,
And, as I say, , a happy crowd
Bore shoulder high the actor proud.”
IVe reckoned it a curious tale.
I wrote to have it verified
By Wells, and by return of mail
“Oh, yes,” that gentleman replied.
“We bore him shoulder high at Yaiu;
But only to the nearest dam!”

They are cheaper—by

ARMERS! When buying, do you select poor-conditioned sheep or cattle? When
selling, do your low-conditioned stock get the best prices?
In the production of better milk, high-test cream, better wool, solid flesh, etc., good
health is the first essential.
Animals respond to better conditions, like tbe human.
Ihe full meaning of this is that your stock must have a rating of Salt Lick. All over the
farming world salt licks have won their position as an indispensable commodity on the farm.
I o-day no fewer than 700,000 cases of salt licks are being used in Australia.
Do you use Salt Licks to your Animals?
If not demand a case of
BONDO Salt Licks
at your storekeeper s. Watch how the cattle relish the rating and see the change in their condition.
Bondo Salt LicLiS are equal to anything in the world’s markets. They are made
in Australia by skilled workmen under the best conditions. They are cheaper; they are weather-
proof, and they are sold in handy troughs so that they can be placed at any corner of the farm.
Ever}' storekeeper, saddlei and blacksmith should at once get in touch with our agents to
handle this universal line. It is better, cheaper, and gives larger profits.

Liquor in Maoriland.
The liquor question in Maoriland has taken
a new turn. State Control —the settlement
which reasonable people saw long ago as
preferable to any kind of coercive legisla-
tion —has become a live issue; and the mat-
ter of compensation or payment to dispos-
sessed liquor-traders is included in the pro-
posals to # be submitted to the electors.
Twenty years ago the Prohibitionists of MX.
were ready to declare that they would rather
support Bung as he stood than give him a
fair deal by compensation ; but at that time
it looked as if they had a straight run with
a definite victory in sight. Now the tune is
much changed. The people in a few districts
tried No-license, and its advocates declared
that it had been a success. That, howeyer,
was not the general opinion; and by the time
a considerable area had adopted the so-called
reform and its workings could be clearly
seen the anti-liquor vote steadied until it
looked as if State Prohibition might still be
a century or so away—in fact, it looked as
if, barring accidents, it might be a whole
eternity away. On several occasions the
prospect of a dry country came very near;
but the electors always baulked at the last
jump. Now a vote is to be taken between
Continuance and Prohibition with compensa-
tion. The compensation is not to exceed
£4,500,000, which is not exactly an amount
to make the Trade feel fat on its permanent
retirement. If Continuance is carried, the
next issue is to be between the existing
system and State Control after purchase by
the State of the entire business. Considering
the extent to which he has wearied the
country in the past and the break-down upon
trial of so many of his arguments, the Pro-
hibitionist will have a difficult job to per-
suade the people that there is anything to be
gained by following him to the polling-booth.
The real interest will centre on the second
choice; and if the State Control side is
fairly put it should win a chance to prove
itself. In that case Bung and Co. will
retire gracefully without grievance.
The Fear of Becoming Like Australia.
The fear of becoming like this country of
ours is a difficulty the Allies find in the way
of collecting their just bill from Germany,
Austria and Turkey. These tyrants may be
made to release the provinces which they
hold by force and where they make the
lives of the conquered folk a misery. That
is to say, their Danish, Serb, Roumanian,
Greek and French subjects may be allowed
to attach themselves and their lands to
their native States if they so desire —which
they evidently do. Poles, Czechs, Ukranians
and others may be helped to set up for them-
selves. But this is bare justice—not in-
demnity. The Allies may divide the Hun’s
non-German possessions in Africa and the
Pacific, but the immediate value of these is
small. They don't want any territory with
a strictly Hun population, for the annexa-
tion of powerful hostile races is taking a
crocodile into the bedroom and a boa-con-
strictor into the pantry. The Hun fleet,
unless there is another naval war to give it
employment, is mere scrap-metal. To man
it and maintain it with no work for it to
do would be as bad as a new pension-list.
A little money can be exacted, but the
amount of actual coin, even in a rich
country, isn’t half a circumstance. There
remains the resource of making the Hun
pay in goods and pay over a long period of
years. But if the Hun builds ships for the
Allies in part payment of his liability he
will learn to be the world’s boss ship-builder,
while they will forget the art and become
feeble and obsolete. It is the same with
machinery, clothing material, chemicals, etc.
The enemy may be made to liquidate his bill
gradually with raw materials like coal and
ore and potash and hides and cattle, so that
he will be a mere crude producer of cheap
things like the Australian. But to let him
pay in manufactured goods would make
him perforce the world’s most strenuous and
expert artisan. Meanwhile the Englishman
and the Frenchman, with lots of Hun goods
coming in, would lose the incentive to high-
class work. So they would become like the
Australian —casual people dependent on
others for their best goods-—and if they grew r
to be importing cranks like the Australians
the indemnity would be bought at too high
a cost.
“Edo”: Will Eastern State people kindly
support their own wowser agitators? Any-
way, for Heaven's sake keep them out of
Westralia, which carries sufficient local sup-
plies. Since trans-line trains started the
Holy Children have been arriving in Wmt-
ralia in a steady procession. Mostly their
wheeze is the curse of der-rink, but they
don’t hesitate to accuse the whole community
of a calamitously drunken style of living.
Then they send round the hat! Westra-
lians are not all exactly angels, but the
charges made against them by these pedlars
call for sudden rebuke. The other evening I
heard two of the talent blowing off bad air
about drink and its alleged accompanying
evils to an audience composed mostly of
very young girls. The discourse w r as just
about the limit. The “quack,” no matter
what line of goods he’s trading in, should be
suppressed.
“Vic”: There has been some excitement
over a rumor that Archbishop Mannix in-
tends to post off at once to Ireland. A
guarded official announcement is that,
according to present resolve, he will not go
in the course of next year. It can well be
understood that there have been pressing in-
vitations from Ireland in the existing crisis.
Mannix stands third among Irish ecclesi-
astics and is only overshadowed by Armagh’s
Cardinal Logue and Dublin’s Archbishop
Walsh, who is anxious to build his new
cathedral on the fine handy wrnste left by
the Sinn Fein in Saekville-street. Probably
neither Logue nor Walsh is within coo-ee of
Mannix as a platform orator or advertiser.
Certainly neither of them has his daring.
Mannix, on fire himself, would probably set
old Ireland crackling nicely. From a sect-
arian point of view Australia is very green
wood.


STUDEBARER
Extends tbe Compliments of tbe Season
and PEishes you all
A Happy and Prosperous New Tear!
■MMTUDEBAKER believes it will be Australia’s happiest and most prosperous new year.
Happiest —'because of Peace and the return of its Manhood —those glorious super-men
who gained immortal glory on so many battlefields.
Most Prosperous —because of its great store of Primary Products which are so urgently needed
by the rest of the, world, and which the world will come after and pay for at good prices—because
until supply exceeds demand prices cannot decline.
We know that our prosperity is bounded only by the number of cars we can land, for our New
Series 19 Studebaker Cars are just the kind of cars that are wanted in Australia.
There’s — A Light Four
A Light Six
A Big' Six
You’ve reallv eot to see them to realise how beautiful they are —to drive them to know their
j o J
Comfort, Ease of Operation, Economy and Power.
Gear Boxes are amidships; high-tension magnetos are fitted in addition to the efficient starting
and lighting system ; the drive is Hotchkiss; they have spiral bevel differentials and are equipped
with Goodyear Tyres.
We tested the first three models to arrive by driving them to Brisbane and return.
The Four averaged 26 miles to the gallon, the Light Six 23, and the Big Six 20.
On the Big Six the tyres demonstrated that they would average better than 5000. On the Four
and Light Six we don’t know their possibilities- —they have been on for more than 4000 miles
and look good for as many more.
Unfortunately our supplies will be limited for at least another six months, due to the fact that
the Studebaker factories have been exclusively engaged on War Work, and now on account of
the great scarcity of materials cannot hope to resume production for some time yet.
Every Series 19 landed to date has been snapped up on arrival.
Everv Series 19 owner is thoroughly satisfied. Ask the first one you meet what he thinks of
his new Studebaker.
Further limited stocks are expected to arrive during the ho idays. An order booked quickly may
make an early delivery possible.

About Grabbing International Pugs
Before the Fight Starts.
Dear Bulletin, —It seems reasonably clear
that if the Allies or any single Ally secures
the extradition of the Kaiser and the busi-
ness of putting him up for trial actually
commences a new precedent of almost un-
imaginable consequences will be established.
Putting aside the perplexing problem of
where the Ally would discover a Judge or
juryman who had not been made the victim
of influences calculated to create bias against
the prisoner, the mere preliminary proceed-
ings would be of the earth-shattering variety.
Presumably the culprit would first be pro-
duced at a court of summary jurisdiction,
and after the local drunk and petty larcenist
had been disposed of the clerk would call for
W. Hohenzollern. Whereupon, after hear-
ing evidence as to the arrest, the beak
would announce that, a prima facie case
having been made out, the accused would be
committed to the Assize Court for trial. Then
there would be a repetition of the pro-
ceedings there, aud finally the black cap and
all the rest of it. But, amazing to W.
Hohenzollern and other ex-kings though
all this might reasonably be. and disastrous
though the damage to the dishevelled doctrine
'of Divine Ilight might look, the mere annexa-
tion of William in the flesh on a criminal
charge would in legal, political aud historical
significance be of far more importance than
the shabby happenings in court. If a man
who instigates a war or sanctions acts of
barbarity during war or conspires with divers
persons, known or unknown, to make some-
one else instigate a war, may be arrested and
tried for homicide or something, the princi-
ple needs no extension to make the fear of
arrest as real to the proprietor of an army
as to the owner of a jemmy. A League of
armed Nations bound together by treaty of
co-operation in the maintenance of peace
would scarcely be as reliable an institution
for preventing war as a wholesale agreement
about the extradition of anyone who hap-
pened to yearn for a disturbance. Had there
been such an agreement before, W. Hohen-
zollern would long ago have been arrested
on the plaint of some citizen of France. Nor
would the Boer war ever have supervened,
because I*. Kruger would have extradited
Joe Chamberlain on a charge of accumulat-
ing cordite with ulterior design of fracturing
the peace. Whether Chamberlain might
not have got in at the early door and applied
for the extradition of Kruger on the ground
that he was arming the local commands, and
thereby causing numerous persons to fear
bodily violence, may be dismissed as irrele-
vant. So also may the problem of what
might occur to the League if several of its
component parts became transformed into
I Enins and Trotsicys and the Courts fell
in a heap, and all the magistrates bolted
into the bush, and nobody knew where to
find the depositions. The one vital, funda-
mental fact is that, if law and order or any-
thing else can reach a homicide after his
crime, it does not require anything more than
some lubricant on the works to make it com-
petent to grab him before the bloodshed.
Wherefore I respectfully submit that the
War Precautions Act be suspended so that
Australia may discuss the terms of peace in
the midst of the great light now breaking
over the world, and that at monster meetings
in every town, city, State, mine, factory,
shearing-shed, office, warehouse the following
resolution be unanimously passed :—•
That we, citizens of Australia, in public meeting
assembled, declare our unflinching determination to
support to the utmost of our great natural resources
every effort that may be made to bring William
Hohenzollern, ex-Emperor of Germany, to trial on
a charge of divers wilful murders.
That we further declare it to be our solemn
belief that if this man escapes trial for his crimes
against the laws of God and of man the very name
of Justice will be outraged.
And that, in addition to this solemn affirmation
of belief we, citizens of Australia, also declare:—
(1) That no peace which does not provide for
the trial of W. Hohenzollern, now wanted by the
police, will be acceptable to us.
(2) That the Peace Conference will fail in its
most essential duty if it dissolves without securing
agreement among all the nations, semi-nations and
suspected nations of the earth to make the con-
struction of warships and munitions and the drill-
ing of armies and the writing of books on warlike
operations a statutory offence within the domain
of the subscribing nation, semi-nation and suspected
nation, and within the boundaries of neighboring
or distant countries.
(3) That the law of extradition in every country
be so enlarged as to permit of any alleged offender
against the letter or spirit of the agreement being
arrested and held for extradition and trial on the
application of whosoever shall swear an information
against him.
Wherefore we have decided without dissentient
voice that copies of the aforesaid resolution be
immediately forwarded to W. Hughes, with instruc-
tions to place them before the Peace Conference
without delay and to give our representations such
support by speech as in the circumstances may seem
discreet.
If this would be a breach of the War Pre-
cautions Act on account of being likely to
cause disaffection in Timbuctoo or some-
where, W. Watt could attend every meet-
ing and move an amendment. —Yours, O. Yes.
Whether the Licensing Courts of S. Aus.
have power to close certain hotels simply
because the Bench comes to the conclusion
that there are more public-houses than are
needed to supply the needs in their neigh-
borhood is a question which has yet to be
decided. Meanwhile, B. G. Nesbit, the Pre-
sident of the Midland District Licensing
Court, is going to allow the publicans,
against whom nothing can be charged except
superfluity, to continue dispensing grog. A.
T. White, of the Adelaide Hotel, is fighting
a test case to find out how Bung stands. The
position has been examined by the wigs of
South Australia and of the High Court of
Australia, and plaintiff is now waiting for the
verdict of the Privy Council. If the pub-
licans should suffer another defeat, the time
gained may at least be put down as some
measure of compensation. Whatever hap-
pens it won’t inconvenience the beer-sparrer.
It will certainly reduce the number of his
ports of call, but in the time saved in travel
he will be able to load more cargo.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
Admiralty House was unusually full of
handsome frocks and smart uniforms the
other afternoon. The Munro Ferguson had
assembled the regulation supply of political
heads (perhaps “tops” would be a better
word) and their wives, bosses of various
churches, a sprinkle of civil servants, a few
cocked hats and the occasional belltopper
which defies time and free education. On
the Admiralty House wharf a beauteous
being, draped with ropes of gold and with a
sword dangling at his side—the gentleman-
waiter for the French Mission—gazed
solemnly across the tumbling waters.
Perhaps he was thinking of home. On
the upper lawn bis Ex. and Lady Helen
greeted their friends. In horizon-blue uni-
forms, General Pan and bis attache, Com-
mandant Andre, of the flowing moustaches,
having been purred over, the lions made an
ascent to the gravel path, where four D.S.O.
men had their orders pinned on by the
G.-G.
Of the four men decorated. Brigadier Alec
.Tobson, is a Sydney accountant. He did well
at the Front, and speedily rose in militia
ranks.
Lieut.-Colonel Cox T°vlor, It.A.A., also
invested by the Governor-General with the
D. 5.0., won it while in command of the 25th
Field Artillery Brigade in France. The big
N. S. Wales artilleryman is a gunner by
profession, and he joined the old Permanent
Force soon after achieving his 18th birthday
as a subaltern in Victoria Barracks, lie
wears the Queen’s and the King’s South
African war medals, and was “mentioned”
three times in recent despatches for “gal-
lantry and devotion to duty in the field.”
Lieut.-Colonel Lorenzo, in addition to the
D. 5.0., has the Croix de Guerre to his credit.
He is an infantryman with distinguished wax-
service, and he is now on the permanent in-
structional staff.
Major Olding, who had pinned to his
breast the white enamel cross with the red
centre, is an artilleryman.
Mrs. Clark, a young widow, gave a note of
pathos to the gathering. She came forward
to i-eceive the Military Cross won by her
late husband. Lieut. F. Clark, in September,
1917, in the historic fight for Polygon Wood,
in the Ypres area. And very tenderly the
Governor-General put the little leather-case
into the soft hand that closed over the
treasure.
“Caughts of Injustice” (A. A. Hall, secre-
tai-y and general rouseabout), organised by
the N. S. Wales Commercial Travellers’
Association, had the Palace for their
sittings. The theatre was lent by the
Tait management, and the mock trials raised
about £llOO. The Sydney Hospital, Prince
Alfred and the Alexandra Hospital for sick
kiddies divide the cash. Arthur Styan
“Chief Justice,” in all the heated glory (the
afternoon being very warm) of horsehair
wig %nd gown; Walter Baker, whose sonor-
ous tones summoned the victims from some
secret fastness in the stalls; Justice (pro
tern.) Workman; and Constable Harry de
Roebeck were the chief fun-makers. Those
who were heavily fined (for being present)
wex*e the waning Mayor Joynton Smith—also
charged with having too many invisible
means of support—(penalty, £100). a well-
known tailor for “selling it for less”; Hugh
Ward, for being absent (£25), and Arthur
Rickard, for attempting to sell corner allot-
ments in the moon (£5O), were in the list.
Ladies of the jury (Florence Young, Gladys
Moncrieff and others) were each fined for
ogling the pi-isoners at the bar.
Captain Lyons, who married Aileen
Toohey some time ago, is a Queenslander
who was on a Northern station till the lid
blew off Europe. lie is one of many Aussies
who reached Port Jackson aboard the
Makura —minus a limb, unfortunately.
The new head of the Girls’ High School is
Miss Campbell, 8.A., a Sydney ’Varsity
graduate, recently in charge of the Maitland
High School for budding womanhood.
The tortoise-like movement of the Makura
on the face of the waters brings home at
last the Australian press delegates. From
the bald pate of North Head the quarantined
passengers can decide which harbor fore-
shore they most admire. The Bulletin’s
chief, who sent S.O.S. signals for his favorite
’baccy, will turn longing eyes towards the
leafy crest of Mosrnan.
Melbourne got the last look at General
Pau’s benign countenance. The southern
city was their port of embarkation in a
transport. Meadows Smith, of the British
diplomatic service, remains here for the
present.
Professor Mackie puts a firm Scotch finger
on what he terms the weak spot
of girl students' life in Australian
cities—the lack of women's hostels such
as are springing up in the cities of U.S. and
the United Kingdom. But neither he nor
any other speaker at last week's Y.W.G.A.
meeting (which had the question of hostels
as its foundation) actually showed how the
proposed improvement is to be made. The
hostel scheme is in operation in Sydney
in a small and useful way, but rents are
high, wages, food and general working ex-
penses are at their maximum. Miss Mal-
larky’s suggestion of very large hostels with
such fancy trimmings as tennis-courts and
Howery lawns, similar to those she saw com-
paratively recently in England, seems the
right thing; but local investors have always
been shy of anything extensive. So, with a
few happy exceptions, both young and old
girls still oscillate in their thousands between
the shabby boarding-house, in which the odor
of yesterday’s dinner hangs like a pall over
to-morrow’s lunch, and the furnished room
camouflaged as a Hat. Lady Helen took the
chair at this “hoslels-for-women” meeting—a
hardy annual that bursts into bloom about
Christmas, and generally wilts in autumn.
On December 11 the third batch of cadets
finished their four years’ grind at the Aus-
tralian Naval College (Jervis Bay).
Admiral Creswell handed over the prizes.
The King’s Medal went to Midshipmite
Dowling. The “Otto Albert” memorial prize
for gunnery whs tucked under the arm of
Middy Rands. Twenty-eight chubby—or less
chubby and more telescopic—youngsters
turned up at Admiralty House next morn-
ing. The unique experience of a lady Excel-
lency reading aloud the Governor-General’s
remarks (his Ex. being on the official
wallaby) was theirs. Lady Helen was
the deputy. Mr. and Mrs. Albert (whose
brilliant young son Otto, a former naval
student, died of meningitis a couple of years
ago) gave the lads a lunch at Farmer’s.
Cadet Rorke was the chosen to say “thank
you” for the hospitality.
Excellency Helen Ferguson was the official
voice at the opening of Russell Lea garden
fete on Saturday afternoon. That’s tlTe Red
Cross Convalescent Home, situated on a
green knoll overlooking Parramatta River,
bought for returned invalids. A
motor-car to give Billjim the run-about that
does him good is the next needful item. So
the Five Dock and Abbotsford Red Cross
pinnies organised last week’s carnival as a
start towards getting the purchase money.
Madame Ada Baker (portrayed alongside
by Sidney Riley) mentions her birthdays
without a tremor. She declares herself to be
53 —all lightly car-
ried. This popular
teacher of singing
had a complimen-
tary concert given
in her honor in the
King’s Hall last
week. Enthusiastic
pupils refrained from
“chairing” their
chief before a
well-dressed crowded
lious e. Madame
Baker was one of
Steffani’s first stu-
dents in this city.
She has been sing-
ing in public since
ringlet-days. During
four years of war
Madame Baker arranged a succession of con-
certs for patriotic funds, and the work was
done so quietly that no brass-hats noticed it
particularly till her pupils made it clear.
From Brisbane: —
The wives of members of Parliament gave a tea
in honor of Mrs. Ryan, before her departure for
England, at Rowe’s Cafe on Tuesday afternoon. Mrs.
Theodore acted as hostess and Mrs. Huxham made
the farewell speech.
Hilda Eglinton, daughter of astronomer Dudley
Eglinton, was married this week to an Anzac
—Private Edward Clarke, D.C.M. Sister Enid
attended the bride, and Staff-sergeant Rolleston was
the bridegroom’s A.D.C.
Barrister Marcus Hertzberg left for Melbourne
during the week to marry Stella Marks, a pretty St.
Kilda girl, on December 16.
Raymond Smith, of Moss Vale, a grandson
of the late Sam Terry, M.L.C., has placed
a diamond circlet on the finger of the chosen
girl. She’s Philippa Graham, only treasure
of the William Grahams, of Abercorn, in the
Lismore district.
The Governor-General is delighted with
the recent portrait of himself by W. B.
Mclnnes. The young Victorian artist, who
until two or three months ago stuck to
pastoral landscapes, furtively exhibited a
portrait of his wife. It was welcomed as
an achievement. But the work on the G.-G.’s
picture has outclassed it.
Melba, who goes off to Europe via Van-
couver in the Niagara some time in Jan-
nary, intends to make straight for her
home in Paris. Her rent for this gilded
nest is £l2OO a year ( say it quick and
you’ll hardly notice it). John Lemmone
and his flute went over the Murray to swell
the harmony at the Dame’s good-bye warble
on the 17th.
Doris Madden, a niece of the late John
Madden, C.J., of Victoria, will be in Syd-
ney early in the New Year en route to
U.S., where the clever young pianist is go-
ing to try her luck.
Mrs. Garvin, for 35 years headmistress
of the Girls’ High in the barrack-like old
building, is retiring. Up to this Christmas
she has been the potter’s thumb that helped
to shape two generations of girl in N. S.
Wales.
The recent show of applied art by stu-
dents of the Teachers’ College, revealed
some work above
the ordinary—Portia
Bennett’s. for in-
stance. Her sketches
have a delightful
evidence of form,
color and composi-
tion. This Sydney
girl (photo by
Judith Fletcher) has
just finished her
fourth year’s study
in Julian Ashton’s
art classes. She will
be grafted on to the
Education Depart-
ment’s staff as a
junior art, teacher.
Later on. perhaps,
Portia will feel the
call to work with an
easel apart: but she doesn’t feel that way
just yet. She is a daughter of Captain Ben-
nett,* one of our well-known harbor pilots.

Chaplain Stacy Waddy, who will return
to Jerusalem as canon of its Anglican
Cathedral, came home to recuperate from
rheumatics or kindred pleasures. These
were acquired in the Valley of the Jordan
while with the A.I.F. The tall Australian
gave a lecture the other evening which
greatly tickled the imagination of women-
folk—hitherto cold to the charms of spiders.
He related how sporting Aussies varied She'
monotony of battle waits with pugilistic
fixtures between selected spiders. The com-
batants were kept apart in tin boxes till
“time” was called, lest one should in a
moment of excitement eat his rival. Heavy
bets in cigarettes w-ere laid on “Jostling
.Tellicoe” and “Dead Sea Dora,” the two
favorites. A Jordan scorpion settled Jost-
ling J. by hurriedly swallowing that cham-
pion and continuing the combat with Dora.
“The point raised by the Aussies who had
backed ' the Jostler was that he was not
out of the fight, since he was inside the
conqueror and therefore still on top,” said
S,tacy Waddy.
Diminutive little Betty Okls has dropped
back into Sydney again. She; will be remem-
bered as a bygone Merry Widow, and a
decorative item in such musical trifles as
the “Duchess of Dantzic.” Betty is now
Mrs. Freddie McQuade. of the Potts Point
McQuade family. The young McQuade
couple have been farming in America, but
chose a spot where toimadoes and blizzards
occasionally gave the pigs wings and blew
the produce off the landscape, forcing farm-
ers to seek their hurricane cellars. The
thing at last grew wearisome. Betty is con-
sidering a dive into grease-paint again.
The Christian Brothers’ Jubilee is to con-
centrate on wiping off the big debt of
£15,000 on the Training College at Strath-
field. Bazaars and an art union (Ist prize
a £lOOO War Bond) will make their appeal
early in 1919 for the above object. By the
way, Corporal Bede Kenny, V.C., the smil-
ing young soldier who came home the other
day, was a former pupil of the Christian
Brothers at Waverley College.
The Davidson sub-regal lady opened the
new Hospital Handicrafts shop in Camden
Buildings, George-street, last week. The
work displayed was done—and remarkably
well done —by returned soldiers who learnt
the craftsmanship during the weary weeks
oi convalescence.
The Black Cats that smirked, leered and
spat at the visitor to the stall at the corner
of Martin-place on War Chest Day brought
the luck of the day with them. When Cap-
tain Mrs. Floyd, with chief-lieutenants Mrs.
Mackie and Pockley, counted up the spoils
there was £359 to swell the stocking. The
cats were the inspiration of artist Oswald
Allen, each cat drawn from life, and recog-
nisable by its acquaintances. "I know that
cat,” said one well-known motorist pointing
to a feline with a long raking body and an
anarchistic eye. “He lives in Liverpool-
street, and spits anathema at the accursed
master class every time I drive past in my
car.” Investigation proved the truth of the
assertion. The artist had sketched the feline
Bolshevik as he sat on the lid of a dust-tin
near the top of the street which is most con-
spicuous by reason of its pawn-shops and
second-hand shops. Parliament House
should have been located there.
The Methody Ladies’ College broke up
amidst the usual swish of white muslin
skirts. Lady Davidson handed the prizes to
the winners. Miss Sutton, 8.A., chief school-
marm.. served up, with the annual report, the
record of the number of socks and other
things for Billjim that the hairbows had
added to their year’s ordinary tasks.
The general breaking-up for the holidays
included in last week’s fractures the classes
of artist Dattilo Rubbo. After climbing up the
long stairway to the studio in. Rowe-street
the visitors nibbled the send-off cake amongst
the bfic-il-brac of Art, and wished the color-
ist good luck in the New Year. Violet Davies
brought the company together.
Annandale, where once the green paddocks
of the Johnston estate were shadowed by
Norfolk pines, is now a brick and stucco
suburb, with Johnston-street as its chief
memory -of the picturesque early Sydney
settlement. In its Anglican Church, a while
ago, Charles W. Smith, a son of the local
Mayor and Mayoress (Mr. and Mrs. F. 10.
W. Smith), placed a plain gold circlet on
the finger of Vera Victoria Terrett, of the
same hub.
Pastofalist W. C. Grubb, of Tassy, died at
Launceston last week. Mrs. Reggie Alien, of
this town, is a daughter of the late flock-
owner.
Lieut.-Colonel McKenzie (lighting Mac)
of the Salvation Army is out after £5OO to
enable the dispensing of Christmas cheer to
some 3000 adults and children comprising
genuinely needy and sick poor, likewise the
men and women inmates of the Army’s Aged
Poor Retreats, the men resident in the Prison
(late Brigade Homes and Inebriated Institu-
tions, the women and gifts in the Rescue and
Maternity Homes, the habitude of shelters
for men and women, the boys and girls of
Industrial Homes at Bexley and Arncliffe,
besides seeking to provide Christmas-trees
with useful gifts for the children oi the sick
poor in various communities. Send dona-
tions to the Army headquarters, 73 Goulburn-
street.
The death of Canon Vaughan at Mosrnan.
aged 77. removes another veteran whose long
side-whiskers were for many years a familiar
feature in the Summer Iliri diocese.
Basil (best known as “I’at”) Lenehan,
who left in 1015 with the sth Field Artil-
lery, bearing the twin-stars of a lieutenant

Theodore Beggs, M.L.C., of Eurambeen,
was to have been wedded before Christmas
to the youngest daughter of Robert Wal-
pole, ex-secretary of the Employers’ Federa-
tion. Invitations had been issued and
everything looked quite settled, when the
prospective guests each received a brief note,
explaining that the affair had been post-
poned owing to the illness of Mr. Walpole.
The other day romantic old Theodore
slipped dowui to Cowes, the idyllic island-
spot where the Walpoles have been house-
keeping for some time past, and the mar-
riage took place without fuss or frill.
Afterwards the twain were to have motor-
boated back to the mainland, but the con-
veyance failed to arrive in time and the pair
presently set off in a hastily-chartered sail-
ing-boat.
Supported by small pages and a couple of
bridesmaids in mauve_ and anaunic blue,
Alice McCulloch, daughter of squatter Colin
McCulloch, was handed over to the safe
keeping of A. A. Laidlaw last week. The
’groom, who had the usual guard of gentle-
manly aides, received his Christmas gift in
the private chapel, at uncle Sam McCul-
loch’s big place near Crowlands. Arch-
deacon Harris, of Portland, did the splicing.
A.' A. Laidlaw is a son of auctioneer • Laid-
■ law, of Hamilton. The bride was swathed
in white silk and ninon. After the honey-
moon the young couple will watch the divi-
dends grow on the jumbneks at the McCul-
loch property, North Crowlands.
The Carlile-Weigall wedding at the Gram-
mar School Chapel turned into a confetti
battle when the bride and bridegroom neared
the school gates, excited flappers nearly
smothering the pair in a hailstorm of colored
paper. The bride Dora walked demurely
in white satin with a white-tulle veil, orange-
blossom wreath and a large bouquet ‘oif
water-lilies. Captain Luxton was next best-
man to Major Hilary Carlilg. Helen
Weigall, in white and pink with a black hat,
was bridesmaid to sister Dora. The cake-
cutting hapnened at the Weigalls’ Elstern-
wick home. When the lioneymooners set ofl
for Tasmania the bride was wearing putty-
colored tailorings with a Wedge Wood blue
and putty-colored hat. The bridal car ran
through a long lane of cheering children
fi'om the various charitable institutes. It was
a compliment and thanksgiving for the many
motor picnics arranged for them by Mayor
Weigall, president of the Automobile Club.
The Gill-Ilidgcock wedding on Friday,
December 13, at St. Peter’s, was one of the
jolliest celebrations of this expiring year.
The contracting parties were woolbuyer
Fred Gill and Dorothy, daughter of squatter
Hidgcock, of Peventry station, in the River-
ilia, and Coogya estate, in Tdorak. Dorothy
is a dainty young blonde with large blue
eyes and a gift for smart dressing. Bride-
groom Gill is a son of wool-merchant Arthur
Gill, of Bradbury, England. There were two
bridesmaids—sister Mary (with her hair just
up) and Miss Jackson. The breakfast was
at 7.30 p.m. at Menzies’, where half the
lounge as well as the supper-room and the
eastern room were reserved for the rites. The
bride wore petal-pink and white crepe de
Chine with a big forget-me-not-blue hat. One
bridesmaid was in black and gold with pink
rosebuds, and the other was quaintly gowned
in black and white. Many of the women
guests wore low-cut gowns and big tulle hats.
Mrs. Hidgcock was in flimsy grey with a big
black hat and she carried a bouquet of scarlet
roses. After the newlyweds had been fare-
welled about 50 of the guests went on to
supper at the Oriental. The wedding was
timed to allow the two principals to catch
the Niagara for America and England. The
Australian bride will , find her new home in
Harrogate, Yorkshire.
Jim Kirkland, the quiet Scotch boss
accountant in Australia for the British Im-
perial Oil Co., is to be married to Florence
Watson, daughter of hide-merchant Watson.
Florrie is one of the pretty girls of Toorak.
Commander Feakes and his wife (she was
a Miss Patterson) have acquired a baby
daughter. She has been named Diana. The
Commander is stationed at Sydney these
times.
Mrs. Ramsay McNicoll is off to London
again to see her husband, Brig.-General
McNicoll, D. 5.0., who was taken out of the
lines shortly before the armistice was signed
to fill a large-sized job in the preparation of
another Australian pressure on the Front.
Mrs. Ken Field (once Miss Huon) is
coming back to Victoria from Tasmania.
Hubby has bought a place next to the Agar
Wynne station, and the couple is busy buy-
ing carpets and furniture.
Mrs. George Fairbairn has given all her
Red Cross workers a keepsake. The recipi-
ents —Toorak sassiety dames mostly—now go
about wearing a gold boomerang decorated
with a kookaburra and the motto. “Dun-
raven Red Cross.”
The Wiltshire brothers are piling up war
honors. Lieut.-Colonel Roy Wiltshire, Com-
manding Officer of the 22nd Battalion, has
the M.C., D.S.O. and Croix de Guerre;
while I.tent. J. Wiltshire, who was lately
awarded the M.C., has already annexed a
bar for it. They are sons of the late Rev. A.
A Wiltshire, of Euroa.
The Greens’ ball was an event of last week.
Mrs. William Green and daughter Florence
gave their big dance in the Town Hall. They
had been working for three months on the
ballet of Bindley’s operatic amateurs at the
Princess’s, and as the opera began the night
before their own show the organisers were
in the last state of frayed nerves. This year
the ball profits go to the hospitals. There
was a grand march and a minuet before the
modern dances. The orchestra was worth
listening to, because the Greens' pupils only
dance to classical music. Maudie Chet-
wynd’s daughter was one of the solo dancers.
Early in the war
Melbourne Hospital

Last Wednesday Mrs. Carse and Mrs.
Mcßean hostessed a fluffy At Home at
the latter’s fine new South Yarra place. It
was a kind of social break-up party before
everyone tracks off for the holidays.
Mrs. Colonel James entertained 50 re-
turned nurses on Saturday afternoon at St.
Ivilda. She arranged for motors to bring her
guests round by the sea-front in the glorious
sunshine, and the cars took them home again
after they had gossiped to the music of the
Kookaburra Orchestra (all girls) and
enjoyed the tea and strawberries.
From Adelaide: —
Money is coming- in steadily for the French Red
Cross appeal, and it looks as though the committee
would get the £lO,OOO it is aiming at. Sales on
Button Day brought in over £2OOO. On Monday
the Galways were at a free admission concert
arranged by the Adelaide Orchestra in aid of the
same fund. A collection in the interval brought
in more than wpuld have come from the sale of
tickets alone. The magnet of the appeal was the
performance of Edith Aird's “Behind a Petticoat”
at the Tivoli on Thursday evening.
Gradually cables are coming through telling of
the return to England of South Australians who
were prisoners of war or internees in Germany.
Capt. A. H. Frazer, M. 0., who was reported
wounded and missing at Dernancourt, and Private
Piper, son of A. W. Piper, K.C., who has been a
prisoner since April last, have both reached London,
while the Government reports that Capt. L. A,
Whitington is on his way back.
The Adelaide Glee Club, with its president, W,
A. Maflarey, as host, foregathered at the South
Australian Hotel on Wednesday evening, and
handed a roll of banknotes to conductor Roy Mellish,
and a silver cake-basket to secretary Edwards*.
Lieut.-Col. H. C. Nott, A.M.C., who left here Jn
1914 and has been on active service ever since,
except for brief furlough some time ago, is now in
command of the convalescent depot at Havre.
Major Pendlebnry, who has been D.A.A.G. here
since January, 1917, has been transferred to Sydney,
where he is to be brigade-major. His billet here
will be filled by Lieut.-Col. Logan.
On Thursday the Governor presented to Dr. Swift
the D.S.O. and M.C. and bar won by his son, the
late Lieut. N. C. Swift. The three decorations
were gained within three weeks, while the lieutenant
was acting-major to the 2nd Battalion of East Lan-
cashires. He was mortally wounded in the action
that brought him his D.S.O.
John Wishart, son of the late J. Wishart, of
North Adelaide, has died in Suva from pneumonic
influenza.
Major-General Salmond, who has just flown from
Cairo to Delhi, was accompanied by Capt. Ross
Smith, a youthful South Australian who did some
brilliant work with the R.F.C. in Palestine.
Some speculation has been kindled as to the future
movements of vice-royalty of South Australia. Gov-
ernor Galway has gone so far as to state publicly
that he is not going to leave South Australia at the
end of the year, and although he would not say so
definitely it is an open secret that he will hold his
present office for another year. On the other hand,
Lady Galway is leaving shortly for England—pro-
bably in January, in the boat Melba travels by—and
farewells are the order of the week.
The society which runs Adelaide Zoo has just
celebrated its 40th birthday, the veteran Simpson
New land (author of the pioneering romance, “Paving
the Way”) being re-elected president. Edwin Smith,
who was also present and who is still older (88),
remarked that he is the sole survivor of the founders
—as he is also in many other of Adelaide’s public
bodies.
“Bunny” Zelman secured a hatful of cash
for the Y.M.C.A. at the Town Hall on Satur-
day. His mostly-girl orchestra, dressed
unanimously in white with an occasional
glint of color about the waist-line, looked like
the gatherings of several debutante sets. In
the interval the sweet things munched choco-
late, presumably to take the taste of Dvorak
ou: of their mouths, but during the perform-
ance their whole attention was given to
“Bunny’s” twinkly fingers and agitated
thatch. Among the principal performers
were Weston-Pett and Dr. Rudall, the Col-
lins-street oculist, who blows tenderly
through the plaintive oboe. Some wag pre-
sented conductor Zelman with a silver nut-
cracker in a decorative basket after he had
finished the Nutcracker Suite. Mrs. Zelman
had the contents of two gardens presented to
her. There was a great swarm in the 2s.
and Is. sections, but the glaring vacancies in
the higher-priced seats showed that the ex-
pensive people of Melbourne are not “musi-
cally starved.”
The Young Ladies’ Bugle and Kettledrum
Band was sprung on the public for the first
time at a concert this week in the Town
Hall. There are 15 members, all in khaki
uniform, like, modern vivandieres, with caps.
The lady conductor had an ornamental pole
to swing gracefully. Another novelty en-
countered occasionally in the Brunswick
tram is the Ladies’ Rifle Club. It’s quaint
to see a number of women of various ages
and shapes, each one carrying a gun. Mel-
bourne has had some weird side-shows during
the past four years.
Much sympathy is felt for Will Quin-
trell, one of the Tivoli musical directors,
who lost his wife last week. There is a
child left behind.
Rene* Tanswell. the clever Melbourne girl,
who won success in Ibsen productions under
Repertory auspices, and who first wore
greasepaint professionally as Vice in
“Everywoman,” has a part in the J.C.W.
panto.
Evelyn Cooke, daughter of squatter Cooke,
of N. S. Wales, is making her professional
debut in “Nothing but the Truth,” the
new J.C.W. comedy. Evelyn was a notable
amateur with Gregan McMahon’s Reper-
torians. She is a living embodiment of the
Maurice Greiffienhagen type of beauty.
“The Girls Who Stayed at Home” are adver-
tising their final performance. With their
amateur song and dance they have made
about £3OOO for patriotic funds. Their 100th
and last appearance will behefit the Blind
Institute.
This is A. B.
Speeding, a Mel-
bourne insurance
man who has dedi-
cated his leisure to
the work of the Red
Cross in Victoria.
Since 1915 he has
been one of the lion,
treasurers of the
Central Depot and
the Home Hospitals
in Melbourne, and
the size of his job
may be gathered
from the fact that
nearly a quarter of a
milliph has passed
through his hands.
Such opulence
might encourage
some treasurers to be reckless; but Speed-
ing has' shown a nice regard for the pur-
chasing value of the pound-note. To see
the record of comforts purchased in a year
—the miles of flannel and bandages; the
campaniles of groceries, sweets and sundries
—is to realise how carefully he has dis-
tributed the treasure in his care. An in-
teresting feature of his work is that, as
member of the Purchase Board of the Red
Cross, he has emphatically recorded his vote
in favor of securing Australian-made goods.
Last May he played a star role in the big
Red Cross appeal, and holds a unique re-
ceipt for £23,000, representing the cash
brought in by the collectors he controlled.
“Rosna”-from London: —
Mrs. L. T. O. Pedler, of Toorak, whose husband is
a major, is a V.A.D. at our Australian Hospital for
limbless Billjims at Southall. Her special job is
in the kit stores. Mrs. Mcßride, one of the daugh-
ters of S.A. Agent-General Lucas, and the wife oi
a lieutenant in the A.1.F., is another worker at t e
same hospital, which is one of the most cheeriu
places in the island, in spite of its 500 legless and

family is keeping Hymen busy this year. One
daughter was married the other day and her eldei
sister, who helps to run the M.L. War Contingent
Association, is seriously thinking of following suit.
Charles Garland, son of the Richard Garlands, of
Melbourne, who has a commission in the A orkshire
Dragoons, has married an Irish colleen. Madge Gar-
land was her name and she is of a Dublin family.
Zoe Wenke, leading lady in Bindley’s
opera season, is a daughter of racing-man
Wenke, whose horses did so well at the big
Spring meeting. Zoe has just blossomed out
of amateur work. She has been coached in
dancing since she was five years old by Mrs.
Green.
Billjim abroad is to have his Christmas
cheer as usual this year. The U-boats were
busy when the vast consignments of boxes
left Australia; but Beatrice Henty, who
superintends the Victorian branch of. the
Comforts Fund, has had a cable advising
the safe arrival of the dainties in London.
Mrs. William Moodie, of Coleraine, in
the Western District, who died the other
day at 75, made a handsome contribution to
the settlement of her neighborhood with a
family of seven sons and five daughters.
The late William Moodie for many years
owned the historic squattage of Wandovale.
near Coleraine, now held by Tom Constable.
Moodie was at one period in partnership
with the late J. O. Inglis and Joe Donald-
son, also deceased, in a couple of N. S.
Wales sheep properties, a venture which
through bad seasons ultimately loosened the
old man’s grip on Wandovale.
Major Farquhar Messer, who used to toil
in the Union Bank at Portland, is on one
of the most recent honor-lists, with the
D. 5.0., for good work in West Africa. 1 In-
Major is the eldest son of the late James
Messer, who used to own Crawford squat-
tage, at Condah, an early-settled section or
the Western District. Afterwards Craw-
ford was bought by the late Jimmy 1 horn-
son, of Monivae, and the Messer family
trekked to Portland. Before the war
started, Farquhar was transferred by the
bank to Westralia. whence he presently de-
parted to do his whack of being disagreeable
.to the Hun.

"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
There were 24 races on Sydney courses
on Saturday—l 3 at the ponies and 11 for the full-
grown animal at Canterbury Park. As a reward for
all the scurry and the encouragement of the thorough-
bred £1570 was handed out in stakes, an average
of £55 per race at the ponies and £77 at the
other place. Some of the races were worth fully
£3O to winners and £6 13s. 4d. to second. Others
ran up to £45 and £56. This was because the
race was not in one dash, but in three, owing to the -
rush of high-spirited quadrupeds to the competition.
There were two extreme eases in which winners took
£75 and £7O. At the two courses the tote turn-
over was £28,368- —so the stake money raced for
represented over 20 per cent, less than the Govern-
ment annexed on general principles as an encourage-
ment to studmasters. As the revenue derived by
the clubs from bookmakers’ fees and admission
charges provides the microscopical stake money at
these weekly proceedings and the substantial profits
to the course proprietaries, the net result of the
tote’s operations on Saturday was to give the
Treasury £1960 and leave about £lOOO over to go
to tote costs and club profits. Apparently stakes
are growing less under the beneficent ; influence of
the machine as it is run in N. S. Wales. _ What the
answer of the Government to the “breeders” is going
to be this page lias no idea. Probably it will con-
sist of an exhortation to notice how much horse-
flesh is improving under the influence of racing for
stakes that wouldn’t keep a dairy cow in hay and
turnips. The inescapable fact is that horses and
owners and the public are being most disgracefully
sweated.
* » * &
They simply won’t have (ho straight-out
tote at Sydney ponies, but they rush the place con-
cern with great emphasis, and it is a rather remark-
able circumstance that the number of times a backer
takes out less than lie puts in js materially less
at the ponies than on the horse course. At Canter-
bury Park on Saturday place-tote bettors claimed
less than their stake 10 times. At the ponies this
only happened on four occasions, and the amount
left behind was smaller on, each dividend. Ori the
straight-out machine the day’s 'investments reached
an aggregate of £l3O. On - two races the total was
nil. On the winners of three other races tire invest-
ments reached exactly 0. So the pay-out window
handed back 17s. 6d. in the £ to losers. These pro-
ceedings have the merit of hilarity anyway.
Wins by Sp’ee(lfast and First Lesson at
Canterbury Park on Saturday brought them botli
into more notice for A.J.C. Villiers and the Summer
Cup. Speedfast took' the Flying Welter, six fur-
longs, with lOst. 21b. and a burst over the last furlong,
which suggests he might run out a couple more fur-
longs with 7st. 121 b. at a fairly solid rate. He was
six horses back at the top of the straight and to then
run a smart nag like Portrait down and heat him
was no small effort. First Lesson, who was seventh
at the turn in the Park Handicap, didn’t seem to
have Buckley’s, bur. took some vigorous exercise
thence onward. This horse, who has been under a
cloud for about a year, but prior to that had done
fairly well (he was third to Patrobas and Westcourt
in the V.R.C. Lcger and finished second to Flash of
Steel, Patrobas third, in the Woodcliffe Handicap at
Caulfield), is not badly handicapped at 7st. 111 b. for
the Summer Cup.
Two Bananalanders, Amberdown and Sydney Dam-
sel, were starters at Canterbury (Sydney), arid
neither of them did anything to make the Villiers
look a certainty, unless they can hurry more rapidly
at the end of the week. Amberdown started in the
Flying Welter with list. 31b., won by Breseis, and
wasn’t signalled on the trip. The Damsel was well
clear of opposition at the turn in the Stewards’ Mile
hut couldn’t stay the pace. Tressady Maid regis-
tered her first win since leaving the ponies by stick-
ing her head in front of the other mare’s just on
the line after an all-in struggle. Sydney Damsel
carried lOst. She had 271 b. less in the Villiers.
Tressady Maid carried Bst. She puts up 6st. 71b.
at Randwick.
* * * fl-
it may be luck or something else, but
whatever it is owner-of-Westcourt and Co. Dan Sea-
ton has more than the average share of good fortune
with two-year-olds. Wolaroi was easily the best of
his year. Dame Acre was nearly ■ so. (Last season
Dan bought a Tressady filly for 110 guineas at the
Segenhoe sale, called her Sue, and in October won
the £1250 A.J.C. Gimcrack with her. lie has
another one, too, that didn’t cost much and doesn’t
owe him much now. This is Sand Dune, winner of
a Nursery -division at Canterbury Park (Sydney) on
Saturday. Sand Dune is smart enough looking to
lie heard of again, a circumstance that is given
additional probability through having cost -only 90
guineas.

War-time restrictions on racing in N. S.
Wales had one queer result. While the embargo
operated the tipping industry flourished as it had
never flourished before. The consequence is that the
Sydney citizen in search of the oil can get it in
about 17 places at the same barber’s shop and some-
thing “extra special’’ on payment of special
fees ranging 'from ss. to 10s. The dailies continue
to do their duty manfully in regard, to both the pony
and the other nag; but! apparently dne or two of
them have the grace to be father ashamed of them-
selves. Anyhow, they) stuff the dope away' in a re-
mote corner concealed .in the smallest type. Yet it
is possible that this is-merely to save space for the,
advts. of the. “ejjfcrar(special” operators' who yell in
large type the price- of the last-minute tip and
enumerate the great accuracy of their last effort.
This last-minute information is doled out in special
editions of “newspapers” to subscribers of the fee
and delivered by the minions of Postmaster-General
Webster. It may be a perfectly legitimate piece of
journalistic enterprise. This page expresses no
opinion on the subject and in any case would find it
a fairly stiff job to see any difference in the journal-
ism of the Sydney Herald, which sells racing tips
for lib and that of the more obscure rag which
peddles out similar goods at a dollar or 10s. a copy.
But what this page is ready to express an opinion
about is the attitude of the Post Office, which shuts
down on the remittance to Tatt.’s and delivers the
goods for the individual with the exhortation to go
and back Damcheck or something for the Flying.
It is the attitude of the william-goat and the one-
eyed Pharisee.
The only difference between the gnat and the
camel in this (hatter is that the animal swallowed
by Webster is much the less savory of the two. The
official refusal to give the citizen facilities to dispose
of his dollar in a sweep is plain foolishness. Official
1 refusal to give him a, chance of patronising the tip-
slinger would be the same thing. To give the latter
a free run and block the other is a lunatic sort of
proceeding without even the attribute of humor so
often identified with madness. People who argue
that both should be sat on by Webster are looking
at the thing from the wrong angle. It is no part
of Webster’s business to prevent people being don-
keys. His main job is not to be a donkey himself.
And in any case the best way to cure anyone of a
taste for thistles is to let him have a bellyful.
That there should be people, and many of them, too,
in the world ready to work for money to hand over
for tips, may be very deplorable; but, after all a
fresh sucker has to be born every minute, because, if
lie wasn’t, everything would fall in a heap and kan-
garoos graze happily where the feet of MacShortodds
once fell.

I loprig (Bobadil-Voluta) , who lately regis-
tered his fourth consecutive win, in the Ballarat
Cup, is inbred to Musket through three of the
soundest branches. The third remove of the pedi-
gree shows an interesting blend, for of the four
stallions there mentioned three—Nordenfeldt, Car-
bine and Trenton —are sons of Musket. St. Simon
completes the list. Of the four mares in the same
section three at least were famous —Electric Light
(dam of Bill of Portland), Steppe (who “carried”
Russiey out from England), and Melodious (dam of
Wallace). The other is The Shell, and she was from
Cocoanut (imp.), the mare who gave us Navigator,
Copra and Trident.
F. Herbert, the English horseman who
some time ago landed in Vie., rode at Tattersall's
recent'meeting at Morphettvilie (S.A.). lie was on
his way to Perth by rail to ride at the Cup meeting
there, and E. B. MeKeon persuaded him to step off
and pilot some horses. He is a strenuous finisher
and ambidextrous with the Whip. In the Final
Handicap (2nd division). Herbert,was on Ptami. A
furlong djji<l a half from home the nag’s position
in the rear looked hopeless, but the rider detected
an opening and vigorously using the whip with his
left hand " (rather a novelty to Adelaide racegoers)
secured a good win. . Adelaide sports reckon the
Englishman is a fine horseman, but then Australians
always think the imported article the best, whether
it’s a jockey or a
“Roller”: That matter of the numerous
horse weighted at 6st. 71b. at Adelaide, and the scar-
city 'of alleged horsemen up to this tonnage (B.
12/12/’ J 8) is merely incidental to a subject of more
importance than the supply of abbreviated humanity.
The 6st. 711). division in practically every race is a
sort of tip into Which handicappers toss the discard.
Also what is really rotten about it is that the handi-
capper must necessarily assess the weight to be
carried by real horses upon the basis of bringing
them into line with the scrubbers. It is a large
calamity to racing that any horse should be allowed
to start in an important handicap with 6st. 71b. —
or, put another way round, that, a horse not con-
sidered fit to carry move should be nominated. The
prevailing -system leads to all sorts of anomalies.
For the A.J.C. Villiers Mile 66 horses were weighted,
the handicap beginning at 9st. 101 b, Of this lot
only 21 were reckoned up to Bst.—that is within a
margin of 241 b. of the top weight. Another 21 were
put between Bst. and 7st. and 24 at 6st. 121 b. and
under. There were 18 of these latter reckoned 3st.
worse than 9st. 101 b. For the Carrington Stakes 73
were handicapped, and beginning at lOst. lib. the
handicapper could only discover 22 worthy of Bst. or
more, and only 24 entitled to more than 7st. and
less than Bst. Twenty were at 6st. 121 b. and under.
For the A.J.C. Summer Cup a range of 3st. was
needed to bring 39 horses together, 24 of them being
2st. and more off (he leader. For Tatt.’s Cup the
difference between top and bottom was 3st. lib., and
of 43 entries 26 were 2st. and more from the top.
The same thing happens over and over again. In
last Epsom weights 54 mokes were weighted to be
3st. and more off the top. The result of this push-
ing in of unproved or embalmed horses into big
handicaps is to load the better-class horse with
horrible burdens—to often compel the handicapper
to give the 6st. 71b. and 6st. 101 b. article an appa-
rent chance by giving the other animal Buckley’s.
“Trot” : The plain remedy for the trouble
about light-weight jocks in S.A. is for the clubs
thereabout to start grading the nags—to insist that
before an animal can start for a handicap in which
racehorses are running with good weights it must
win in another grade and earn at decent horse’s
handicap. A range of 3st'. in a handicap is-gro-
tesque. A handicap framed on giving 4 chance to
what, on performance, has none must manifestly,
stoush the good horse. Take the -Hast 7,Melbourne ,iCup
—won by a five-year-old animal. handicapped at-fist;
71b., with the record of a Parkrstaker and a future,
hajdlv much better in sight. Take -the same race
for' 20 years—won four times by a horse carrying
a good horse’s weight (Bst. or over), and second
money going, iff the safiie period 11 times to the
well-weighted® nag.

“Moana”; When Maorilander Lowry
brought his team of four to this side in pursuit of
cash anyone reckless enough to bet that Desert Gold
would collect less coin than'any of the other three
could have obtained almost any old odds against
such a possibility. Yet the unexpected happened.
Towards the £3974 10s. annexed by Lowry during
the trip Desert Gold contributed only £5OO, while
Estland was responsible for £1336, Finmark
£1157 10s. and Killowen £9Bl. Meantime Est-
land and Finmark have been sold. An offer to part
with Killowen for £1250 last week was declined.
But there isn’t enough small change about to get
the mare with. Desert Gold is still at Randwick
taking gentle exercise till Maoriland gets rid of the
’flu’. This circumstance, by the way, means a lot
to her stake-earning record. Had she got back across
the Tasman for the Christmas and New Year proceed-
ings there were three or four tasty morsels to be had
for the cantering.

A commission or committee or something
of the sort from England will be due in the Com-
monwealth directly. It intends to “make inquiries
into racing conditions hereabouts.” The meaning of
this is not altogether clear. In addition to being
impressed by the multitudinous number of courses
on the premises, the palatial grandstand, transport
facilities and the large percentage of workers in the
vineyard of Judaa, the commission may not improb-
ably feel compelled to impress Australian breeders
with the wisdom of making more copious importa-
tions of horse—especially expensive horse. There
is no need for English racing men to visit the
Commonwealth in order to comprehend the facts
relating to the layout of courses, the amount of
stakes provided hereabouts, the frequency of two-
year-old racing and all the rest of it. They have a
good working knowledge of these things already, just
as Australians have of URc general details of racing-
in England.
There are many differences between the racing-
carried on in the two countries. The sport is on
a different plane. In England the horse counts for
more than the public. In Australia the crowd counts
for more than the moke —that is, taking things gener-
ally, substantially more effort is directed towards keep-
ing the sport “popular” and giving the public
plenty of it than towards remefnbering exactly what
the reason is for racing horses; or, rather, what the
only reason ought to be. The consequence is that in
England the public who go a-raeing have about a
fifth of the convenience provided for the public who
do the same thing in Australia. And the public in
Australia can get rid of the idea that this makes
the racing in England any worse—or that the racing
would be any better or the horse improved if Epsom
was turned into a replica of Flemington. At the
theatre the play is the thing—not the plush-covered
seat or the decorative proscenium, or the fragrant
cigar in the lounge. On the turf what happens, on
the track and the relationship of those proceedings
to culture of the horse matters most. To this, writer
it has always been a matter of much doubt whether
the palatial building and the lawns and the incal-
culable number of courses in Australia had any
justification, or that the vast expenditure on equip-
ment was anything more than sheer waste. In any
case the argument that Australia’s tremendous accu-
mulation of racecourse and grandstand is a necessary
adjunct to successful horse-breeding- in the Common-
wealth is sheer drivel.

“Copabella”: A Geelong (Vic.) man drew
£6OOO in a sweep, and the beggars and the borrow-
ers came down upon him like the Assyrians of old.
One of the first and the most persistent of the swarm
was a “purity” organisation for the abolition of
drink, gaiety and (/ambling! It was in a tight hole
to finance its affairs and was prepared to make
necessity the mother of apostasy.
A. ,T. RumSby, of the Adelaide Harriers
and Walking Club, won the one-mile run conducted
by the Glenelg Club at the District Trained Nurses’
Carnival on the 30th November. Incidentally, he
fled over the distance in 4'min. 42sec. from scratch.
This is mighty good going considering- the rough
state of Glenelg Oval and a shade temperature nearly
touching the ioo degrees. The time is the fastest
recorded in S.A. since the time of P. Spouse, J.
Souter, J. Strachan and H. R. Otliams. These run-
ners could gallop over a mile in 4min. 39sec. and
4min. 40sec., but they , had the advantage of the
turf on the University and' Adelaide ovals to move
their calves on. As Rumsby recently did a five-
mile cross-country jaunt for the championship of the
Adelaide Harriers in 28min. 50sec., it is suspected
that this young runner may be found guilty next year
of establishing some new records in State champ.
“,T. Me.”: Apropos »f the last Easter Gift
at Stawell (Vie.), and the disqualification of the
first three placed men (B. 28/11/’18), how is this
for a record ? I was handicappei- and starter at
Woodanilling (W.A.) on Boxing Day, ’O2, when
every runner who nominated accepted and ' started.
There were five left in the Sheffield final, and all
were disqualified. The first and second had omitted
some of their performances when nominating; the
third and fourth were disqualified for suspicious
running. The last to finish refused -to sign a declara-
tion as to the correctness of the performances he
supplied when nominating. Wherefore the whole of
the’ prize money (£2O) went back to the Club, and
the noise made by the crowd who had entered and
run on the level was like unto the bursting of 17
.volcanoes.

“McK.”: You can have your water-polo
•and aqua : planing-„ but give me the kind of cricket
they were playing the other Saturday up in Bris-
bane. - Says the Daily Mail: “W. Rowe and Joe
Downey (both inter-State men) got together and
were still bathing, with 105 on the board, when
stumps were drawn.” That brings a Cold Country
game dead into line with the Awful climate.

The -St. Kilda Dinghy Club, which made
a. name for itself early this year by 'effecting a
number of risky rescues during the Brighton cyclone,
has a life-saving and war record of which it has
good reason to be proud. During the past year
, club-members have received nine Royal Humane
Society awards. ■ These include four bronze medals,
, garnered by Victor Frayrie, Sam Geliie, Roy Hol-
man and Harry O’Hara, and a certificate won by
Alf Wilson, a returned Anzac who was aboard the
torpedoed Southland. Every one of the fit mem-
bers—94 in all—has done his bit in khaki, while
all the other members except the “nippers’ possess
rejection-papers; and the year’s casualty-lists con-
tain the names of five Dinghy Club soldiers who have
gone west, four of them having commissioned rank.
N. S. Wales team to trip over the border
to Vic. next week has more than the usual number
of new players. Of the dozen only Mailey, Bardsley,
Ratcliffe, Andrews and Pratten were in Ma’s XI s of
1914-15. Noble (captain), of course, was playing
in antiquity. The team is strong in bowlers but
weak in batting. The non-inclusion of the brilli-
ant left-hander J. Bogle (’Varsity) and omission of
both the schoolboys (Brown and Bettington) was
not judicious. Still there is plenty of new blood.
The Vic. selectors stuck to its guns of other years.
The southern eleven includes eight of the party*
which won the Sheffield Shield in 1914-15 ; E. It.
Mayne (who played with S.A. in the same year),
and two others who played inter-State cricket in
other years.
* * * *
Rex Norman (Glebe), who skittled Cen-
tral Cumberland in Sydney grade cricket on Satur-
day by taking six wickets for 14 off 50 balls, is
the star left-hander of N. S. Wales XI to play Vic.
next week. Saturday’s effort raised Norman’s tim-
ber tally to 27, averaging 11.85, which is better
figures than the other top-noteli wicket-gatherers
show—L. Wall (Balmain), 27 at 17.15; S. Free-
man (Gordon), 32 at 18.53; and P. Dive (Western
Suburbs), 28 at 18.89. By the wisdom of the selec-
tors Norman is the only one of these bowlers to
get a place in the reps. Bast season he took 43
wickets at 14.88. When the pitch happens to be
“doing a bit” he is a very dangerous person.
* * * *
It was the old ’uns turn again on Satur-
day for centuries in Sydney first-grade cricket.
Austin Diamond (115) and Ward Prentice (103)
made merry for Western Suburbs against Sydney. As
Diamond (who with Les Seaborn formed one of N.
S. Wales’s Sportsmen’s Battalions) only came back
from France a couple of weeks ago, the punch he put
into premiership and inter-State cricket nearly 20
years ago appears to be still in good order. in
’l4-’l5 Diamond piled up 356 runs, averaging 25.42.
Ward Prentice, who tripped with the Wilhfuy Rugby
Union team to England in 1908-9, only iwssed double
figures with the bat once in eight innings. His aggre-
gate of 532 pans out at 66.50.
There are few better all-round cricketers
in N. S. Wales schools than R. E. Gostelovv, who
captains Sydney in the revived inter-State Grammar
School matches at Melbourne this week. Behind
the sticks lie stands easily first as an enemy of
sundries. With the pall he is a good change. A
recent effort was six for six against C. of E. Gram-
mar. With the bat, Gostelow made top score (35)
for Combined Schools against University last year,
and made 28 in this season’s fixture last week. A
couple of years ago he smacked 1 up 140 against Scots’
College. At tennis he was runner-up (with Garvin)
in last Sydney Grammar doubles championship.
A marksman scored the “impossible” at a
rifle-match in Adelaide recently. 1-Ie had the liberal
handicap of 23, and putting on 31 and 28 was
credited with a total of 82, whereas the possible off
the rifle was 70. For a competitor to finish that
way leaves the man without an extra big allowance
in a hopeless position. So what’s the use of., com-
petitors with concessions of nine, eight send . six
points trying? Clubs with no handicap limit, who
permit the whole of the allowance to be counted,
are certainly not encouraging rifle shooting, as with
even a possible at each range many have no chance
of winning.

“Machete”: They are working a new
variant of two-up down our lane. There’s always
a crowd of the lads idling about and always a John
or two in the offing. Tossing ’em in the air is thus
quite out of the question, so they work it with two
tljreepenny-bits in a dice-box. These are rolled out
on a piece of newspaper, and the John Hop can stand ’
within a yard of the little group, and see nothing.
First time I’ve struck the new stunt, and I’ve seen
our national gamble worked in three continents.

When from it’s cave, the diver brave,
Was faced by a devil-fish,
As it grimly twirled, he’s axe he whirled,
And struck with might and main,
Then steadily shrank from the reptile rank
Whose carcase he'd rent atwain,
That night within he’s island home,
Beside the sounding sea,

With lie’s child upon he’s knee.

The greatest of all of that which is great;
She sweeps the seas ai.d cares for those in need,
And looks after all her smaller States,
Oh! To remember their loyalty to ’Clown and

Their strong and outstretched arm,
For more than a century and they never tire;
With hearts of steel they free us from harm.
Oh! Their hearts beat true with the Royal

They give their all and then 1 hearts to bleed ,
They give their blood as if in a flood.
For" their great and Umpires need.
Oh! These great gallant and loyal men,
That saved our shores of yore:

The disastrous fire at the Mitchell River
(Q.) Hospital, the other clay, accounted for.
the loss (amongst other things) of a con-
stderable number of fine photographic nega-
tives, property of Cyril Grant Lane, nature-
study man. Lane, who has published a good
deal of valuable stuff, and is a lecturer of
some authority on the subjects he handles,
has been attached to an Anglican Mission
for four years or so; but at the time of the
Morninaton Island tragedy he went along to
the Mitchell Hospital to take charge for the
Presbyterians. At the time of the- fire he
was at Thursday Island, waiting to catch a
boat back to the Mitchell. A fine 50-guinea
camera went out with the pile of negatives.


REXONA and REXONA SOAP.
MORE POPULAR THAN EVER.
Rexona is a glorious soap. I regard it as abso-
lutely the best I can buy. It seems to protect the skin
against sun and wind., and removes any temporary
skin blemish caused by ill health. I also think the
world of Rexona Ointment. For cuts and skin troubles
of all kinds there is nothing to approach it. It relieves
and then cures so quickly. Rexona Soap and Rexona
Ointment are indeed twin blessings. I And the Soap
is delightful as a shampoo. It cleans and invigorates
the scalp perfectly, and leaves the hair soft and glossy.
Wishing you success,
Yours faithfully,

Beauty and Rexona
X your complexion worries
ou, and you feel that your skin
, unattractive instead of fresh
nd smooth —look to the soap,
vou are using. Many soaps are more harm-
ful to the skin than actual neglect, for they
contain alkali, which makes the skin harsh
and dry. Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is a
specially prepared Skin Soap free from
alkali, and contains just that right amount of
the gentle healing medication of Rexona the
Rapid Healing Ointment, which is so widely
used in the treatment of skin and scalp
troubles. Rexona Soap relieves the clogged
pores and the tendency to redness, cleans
away the blotches and oiliness, and brings
back that natural beauty to the skin which is
the heritage of every woman. Rexona Soap
makes the best, shampoo for the hair. Tt
cleanses the scalp from dandruff, and leaves

1 am delighted with your Rexona Soap, and am
sending .von my photograph to show how much good
it has done my nair. 1 nave been using it now ior
nearly three mpnths, and it makes the hair so soft and
fluffy that I am always going to continue to use it.
Rexona Soap is miles ahead of anything I have
ever tried before. Hair tonics and shampoos do nothing
like tlie good that Rexona Soap does. I should think
that every girl would use it, and I am sure they do if
they have once tried it. It is so good for the com-
plexion too, it leaves the skin so clear and fresh.
I have a pot of Rexona Ointment, too; it really is
a rapid healer. I have found it excellent for pre-
venting sunburn. I can assure you I shall always go
out of my way to praise Rexona.
Vours truly,

Miss DUDLEY LINDSAY (from a photo),
To Know the REXONA
Remedies is to Like Them
I am sending you my
photograph, as I want to
join your Rexona girls,
for I consider that I am
truly one. I have been
using your Rexona and
Rexona Soap now' for over
a year, and consider them
both excellent, I have found
Rexona most healing and
a wonderful skin remedy.
Rexona Soap is certainly
quite unsurpassed as a
Toilet and Medicated Soap.
I think it is simply de-
lightful. and would never
consider ever using any
other kind again. I am
also enclosing three
Rexona Wrappers, which
I have taken from the
soap, and w'ish you would
please send me one of
your Bubble Pipes, which
I notice ron aovertis" to
give with each three
wrappers from Rexona
Soap posted to you.
I hear that Rexona is
now the most used of any
soap in Australia, and I
am sure it deserves to be.
(Sgd.) Yours truly
DUDLEY LINDSAY,
Jamison Town, Penrith.
I have been using both Rexona the Rapid
Healer and Rexona Skin and Facial Soap for
a long time, and with the best results. I can
truly say ■ that I, too, am a Rexona girl. What
a wonderful thing Rexona is! I have had occa-
sion to use it more than a dozen times, and
in every instance have found it a most won-
derful healer.
For my hair I would not think of using any-
thing else but Rexona Soap—it makes it de-
lightful, and keeps the complexion so clear
and fresh. Surely there is nothing like it.
Did anyone ever tell you how good Rexona
Soap and Ointment were for tired feet? And
really they are a 20th century luxury in this
respect. To bathe the feet
with Rexona Soap and to
anoint with a little Rexona
takes away all the tired-
ness. and leaves one’s teet
feeling as fresh as in the
morning's.
Honestly, Rexona is first
and last with me all the
time, and I shall always
give it the praise which it
justly deserves.
Sincerely yours,
(Sgd.) ELLERA NERI.
REXONA —Everyone's Favorite.

All the Avorld over everyone likes the Rexona Remedies. They are universal favorites and never disappoint you. Rexona is the Rapid
Healer, and Rexona Soap is the facial soap of the century. Care for yourself by using Rexona and Rexona Soap, and your skin will reflect the
improvement from the first, and you will delight yourself as well as your friends.
Rexona the Rapid Healer has always been famous, for its wonderful healing powers. Many people now
thank Rexona for skin health and comfort. It is a reliable remedy for bad legs,, cuts, burns and all irritations
and eruptions of the skin. Xo home can afford to be without Rexona, so take a tin home to-night.

Worry is a Disease.
The disorder which causes its victims to
worry, whether they have anything to worry
about or not, is neurasthenia.
Neurasthenia is entirely distinct from
hysteria, although the patient may have
both diseases at the same time.
Neurasthenia often results from some ner-
vous shock, such as the loss of a near rela-
tive, business reverses, or some severe oyer-
strain on the nervous system. The patient
is usually pale, showing that the blood is
thin, and" the first thing to do is to build up
the blood, because anything that builds up
the general health helps to correct the neu-
rasthenic condition. Rest and a good tonic
is the very best of treatment in most cases.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are an ideal
tonic for this condition, because they con-
tain no alcohol or harmful drugs, and neu-
rasthenic patients should avoid alcoholic
stimulants.
The Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. has pub-
lished/ a little book on nervous disorders
that' contains a chapter on neurasthenia, in
which the symptoms are fully described and
the correct treatment given. The booklet is
free to those who send a post-card to the Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Co., Bos 594 G.P.0.,
Sydney.

Williams’ Pink Pills, or they will be mailed,

Cuticura Healed.
“My face, neck and chin broke out
in blotches of pimples, which soon
came to a head and festered.
They soon began to get very
itchy causing me to scratch
them making them worse
and afterwards disfiguring
my face for a long time.
“I had been suffering for
about two years until I read
an advertisement for a free sample of
Cuticura which I tried. I then bought
some more and before many weeks of
treatment with Cuticura Soap and Oint-
ment my skin was quite clear of all the
pimples.” (Signed) A. H. Doyle,

The famous Glenelg (S. Aus.) breakwater,
on which much money has been expended,
won’t be finished for some considerable time
yet if it is ever finished. For the present all
work in connection with this much-discussed
State enterprise has been suspended, and
only five or six of the concrete piles which
form part of the structure have been placed
in position. The contractors, Stone and
Siddeley, won’t go on with the work,
although the Government expects them to do
so, and deliver the breakwater according to
specifications. The story of the breakwater
is a long one. Neither the Peake party nor
the party which was Vaughan’s admit re-
sponsibility for starting the job. It has
been handed on like an original sin from
one Government to another. As finally
planned it was to have cost £llO,OOO, and
Stone and Siddeley undertook to construct
according to Government specifications for
that sum. However, when the work had
proceeded to its present stage, a storm,
which, according to expert opinion, would
have blown the puny breakwater to
smithereens if it had been complete, came
whipping across the gulf. As it was., the
tempest shook the pillars to their foundations,
and Stone and Siddeley blamed the Govern-
ment specifications. They applied for more
money in order to add to the strength of the
cement work, in effect alleging that they had
been induced to start the job. under false
pretences. The Government didn’t lend a
willing ear, and the result was that the con-
tractors, nearly a year ago, started proceed-
ings against the Harbors Board for breach of
warranty, claiming £60,000 damages. The
action was set down for hearing in the
Supreme Court this month, but has had to
be again postponed until the March session
on account of the briskness in court busi-
ness. The Harbors Board is entering a
counter-claim for £4773, and until the cases
are disposed of visitors to South Australia
will have a visible monument to man’s in-
curable habit of making a mess of things.
“Edo”: How many places can beat Ival-
goorlie for prosperity? The municipality is
absolutely out of debt and has close on
£lOO,OOO worth of assets. Since the outbreak
of war the small population, about 15,000,
lias subscribed over £120,000 for patriotic
funds, to say nothing of numerous amounts
not classified. While the French Mission
was in the town a concert in its honor re-
sulted in £232 being raised for the Mission
to take back to France for the. Red Cross,
and the Racing Club gave £250 for the same
purpose. On Armistice Day the sale of soft
drinks in temporary stalls in Hannan-street
brought in £l2B, and a few days previously
the Bowling Club gathered £l2l, both sums
for soldiers.
During November 1773 acres were bought
in Victoria for returned soldiers, the price
being £20,638, or £lO 12s. 9d. per acre.
There are 14 lots, so apparently 14 soldiers
may be settled on 127 acres each, but one
lot of 717 acres will bear cutting up, making
room for 15 or 16 soldiers. Sixteen soldiers
will owe on an average £1290 apiece, apart
from any necessary improvements, stock,
implements, seed, etc. The pace isn’t tre-
mendous, nor are the farms, but the liability
is. A new boot-factory would settle as
many soldiers in a week for a tenth the
money.
“Val Day”: Has everyone forgotten that
of Queen Victoria’s nine sons and daughters
no fewer than six married German princes
or princesses—all impecunious and all pro-
lific, who, with their countless progeny, were
all promptly saddled on the British tax-
payer by her Gracious of revered memory?
By the way, one at least of those
German princelings was morganatically mar-
ried ere he was matrimonially pensioned by
the British people. That was Prince Chris-
tian, of Sonderburg-Augustenburg, whose
prior matrimonial entanglement was over-
looked by the Queen —ordinarily so strict—
when he married Princess Helena, aged 19,
in 1865. As for the members of the Royal
family who did not marry Germans, the first
was the Prince of Wales (afterwards
Edward VII.), who married the beautiful
Princess Alexandra of Denmark, in 1863;
Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who married
Marie, Grand Duchess of Russia, in 1874;
and Louise, who married the Marquis of
Lorne (afterwards the Duke of Argyle) in
1871. By the way, the Duke of Edinburgh
_ became the Duke of Saxe-Coburg in 1893, and
then gave up the annuity of £15,000 yearly
voted by the House of Commons, but stuck
to the £lO,OOO yearly given to him as a
wedding allowance. Had Alfred (one of the
meanest of the profligates) lived, he would
have been one of the 278 German kings and
queens, princes and princesses, dukes and
duchesses dethroned since the Kaiser’s throne
—erected on a platform of dead men’s skulls
—crumbled beneath him. I am curious to
know how many of the German princelings
once on the British Civil List now remain
there and how much the taxpayers have
saved by the termination of their princely
pauperism.
South Australia has had a far-northern
bush tragedy. George Snell was part-owner
of Angepina and other stations, and John
Grindell, his father-in-law —well known as
an exhibitor of horses at the Adelaide Show
—had used threats against him, declaring
(as was sworn) to “do for him if I get him
in. a quiet spot.” Then Snell disappeared.
Black-trackers, after a long hunt in wild
country, found human bones in an old fire
and said there was a track of Grindell’s
camel both ways. After trial, sentence of
death was passed at the Port Augusta Cir-
cuit Court. Grindell protests that he is
innocent; his counsel argued that it is not
even certain that Snell is dead. Anyhow,
all the evidence of a crime was circum-
stantial.
Some figures about thread reveal the dif-
ference between being a country that manu-
factures things and a raw-material country
which pays the salary of a Ministerial lout
who says new industries aren’t necessary.
Last year the English Sewing Cotton Co.
and the American Thread Co. handed out
dividends of 20 and 23 per cent, (about
double their usual rates) after paying the
War Profits Tax. And non-manufacturing
Australia paid nearly four times as much as
usual for its imported cotton. All the
highly-paid price-fixers in existence couldn’t
help it.

Miss J. W- HOLLAND (from a photo.)
Milson Road,
Dear Sirs, — Cremorne.
Many years ago in a
women’s hospital I saw Dr. Shel-
don’s Gin Pills used and heard
them well spoken of. Afterwards,
when I got ill with backache,
caused through chill of the kid-
neys, it seemed quite natural for
me to take what I had seen do so
much good in similar cases. What
Gin Pills had done for others they
did for me, and I am quite well
and strong. I always keep Gin Pills
by me and I take some directly
there is any threatened change of
weather, particularly if my back
or limbs ache. I am sure Gin Pills
are widely appreciated, for when-
ever I recommend them I gener-
ally And that my friends have
been in the habit of using them
before I spoke. I write, as I think
what I have to say will interest,
you, and because 1 am grateful
for the benefit I have received
from your fine remedy.
I remain, Yours truly,
(Sgd.) J. W. RORRAND.
GIN PILLS WILL HELP YOU.

ins begin taking Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills for Backache and Kidney Troubles, because

RODERIC QUINN.
The Indefatigable.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
electric chain of thought that links
I so many apparently dissimilar things
together, so that if one be touched
by the skirts of Chance in passing the other
image is instantly called up, has done, a
curious thing for me. A roaring Biitish
battle-cruiser dying splendidly in smoke and
flame in the grey North Sea is for ever asso-
ciated in my mind with a stout little man
in a grey summer suit and straw boater hat
hurrying' to and fro in the centre of a grassy
arena surrounded by a flagged bicycle racing-
course. The sea battle belongs to lJlb and
the stout little man to 1890, and, despite
the long years that stretch between, I will
never be able to separate them because ot
that slight thought-chain which is formed
of the single word “indefatigable.”
When the naming department of the Bri-
tish Admiralty, in 3909 or thereapouts,
selected “Indefatigable” as the name of the
newest thing in fighting ships, they picked
on the adjective that always used to accom-
pany the title “secretary.” Some 20 years
ago every secretary was “indefatigable’ ; it
he wasn’t so described every time his name
appeared in print he considered it a reproach
and ran a little harder to prove that he was
indefatigable. The “hon. sec.” who ran
hardest and had, in my estimation, the best
claim to the long word was the little bicycle
club man I watched in my youth. In the
leisurely days of 1887, when bicycling was a
strictly amateur sport, the side-whiskered
young men put on a sort of Little Lord
Fauntleroy costume to pedal 20 bumpy miles
on their high “ordinary” machines. The
little secretary then was a chubby-faced boy
riding solemnly in his place in the twinkling,
rattling line, and waiting for the first toot
of the club bugle which would order the
members to wheel into a new formation.
For the clubs of dandies did their runs then
with the solemnity of manoeuvring battle-
ships, and a new member had to study
pretty hard before he was competent to go
out with the boys. The medalled club-
captain was the admiral in command, and
his word was law to the serious young men
of the period as they swept along the motor-
less roads at a pace that seemed reckless
then, but would nowadays make travellers
impatient if not actually ribald. _ But the
internal combustion, oil-eating engine wasn t
yet dreamed of, and clanging firebells called
hand-reels from suburban stations. Horsed
engines and hose-carts were found only in
the important fire-fighting centres. ?
When summer came in and the club s
great day arrived the chubby boy-secretary
would be prominent in full uniform on the
hired ground, dashing to and fro and trying
not to look too self-conscious as he practised
indefatigability in front of the great ring of
spectators. The beautifully cleaned and
polished bicycles, laid on their sides in the
centre of the arena, looked like a hopeless
tangle of metal from a distance; and when
the silken-jacketed competitors walked out
one by one, lifted complete spidery bicycles
from the tangle and wheeled them away to
their various chalked starting-points, _ it
seemed rather like a clever conjuring trick.
They had a wide and clumsy “tread” those
high and graceful bicycles, and when the
puff of the starter’s pistol sent each compe-
titor forward with a mighty heave (a strong-
armed friend Avas a great asset on the big
day), the busy feet of the racers moved in a
sort of duck-paddle. But the long spokes
of the big front wheels sliced the. warm air
finely and made a bird-like Avliirring as the
bunched field swept past like a moving tower
of silver and fluttering silk. The wind made
the jockey-jackets billoAV at the back, and
the silken, long-peaked caps reflected the
sun. Sometimes there would be a ringing
crash, and at once the flat track would be
littered with fallen machines with the little
back wheels spinning foolishly in mid-air
above the sprawling riders, all of them dazed
by the fall from their high saddles. Pure
accident mostly, for it was clean amateur
spcrt then with cups and more cups for the
proud winners. And while they whirled in
silk through those far-back summer after-
noons, and the back-markers threw off then-
caps in formal challenge before starting to
nod like clockwork mandarins and go after
their fields, the chubby boy-secretary ran to
and fro and strove with all his might to
deserve the coveted adjective “indefatigable. ’
It was his inscribed cup and tea-and-coffee
service.
Skip a lot of pleasant years and come to,
say, 1898. The high “ordinary,” with its
big thin wheel in front and the little one
behind at the end of the metal kangaroo-
tail, has gone. In its place is the light dia-
mond-framed “safety,” with its two wheels
of equal size shod with thick, sausage-like
tyres filled with pumped air. They look
absurdly clumsy after the thin and graceful
solid tyres; but on these circular air-cushions
the wonderfully light “safety,” with its end-
less chain drive to the rear wheel, skims over
the close-cropped grass like a swallow or its
own shadow. On top of each racing-machine
is crouched a hard-faced capless athlete clad
in close-fitting knitted wool “sweater” —a
lustreless workmanlike garment. These
racing cyclists of 1898 don’t look a bit like
the side-whiskered amateurs who raced for
cups; nor does the immense croyrd seem to
have quite the same holiday air of the old
audience. Instead of inscribed cups there
are big money prizes, and bookmakers are
doing a brisk if furtive business. The
knowing sport can tell you tales, of racing
professionals (some of them visitors from
England and America) who don’t want, to
win, but belong to “teams” each of which
has its selected man to be paced and made
way for when the bell rings for the last lap
and the hurrying field shakes and leans like
a lot of yachts struck by a sudden gust. It
is more like a business now. The competi-
tors of old are middle-aged lookers-on or
well-dressed officials who take a pride in the
social and sporting importance of the big
meeting, now spread over two Saturdays.
Out in the centre of the ground, busy as
ever with Governors and distinguished visi-
tors. beckoning, ushering, explaining and
commanding—is an unforgettable personage
whom middle-age has failed to disguise ■
the Indefatigable Secretary. Time has
added enormously to his importance; he is
now the king-pin of one of the great sport-
ing fixtures of the year, and wears the dis-
tinction proudly. It may not be absolutely
necessary for the secretary (“hon.” no
longer) to keep waving his arms so much ;
on the other hand, it may, and in any case
it helps to keep non-sporting people inter-
ested. The circling champions accomplish
extraordinary “times” with their air-shod
wheels, the “military” band thumps Gilbert
and Sullivan emphatically by the grandstand
at long intervals, and professional cycling,
besides being absorbing to watch, is very
profitable. But though no man of 1898
realises it, the Golden Age of Cycling and
the glory of mere man-power is waning.
During an interval an absurd mechanical
buggy steered by two stiff, self-conscious
men and having no well-groomed horse on
the other side of the splashboard, smoothly
circles the track once or twice at a gentle
speed. Some onlookers applaud respectfully;
but the majority just stare, and a few are
highly amused by the passing of the quaint
thing. Programmes are hurriedly referred
to. and a brief note is discovered to the
effect that “Mr. and Mr. —— (two
unknowns) will give a demonstration of an
auto-car during the afternoon-tea interval.”
So that's what it was! Nice girls every-
where agree that they. wouldn’t like to.be
seen riding in a silly thing like a mechanical
toy. Then the strange auto-car, having exhi-
bited itself, is run into the centre of the
ground out of the way, the man-racing be-
gins again, and the stout secretary starts
once more to be indefatigable.
Another jump to 1909, and we are in a
different world, the outstanding feature of
which is the utter deadness of the sport of
cycling. If you are an early workman, a
remote shearer or a freak, you can buy a
perfectly good foot-propelled roadster
bicycle for £9 or so where. 11 years before,
you would have been confidently asked £2O
or £3O. H. G. Wells’s cycling novel, “The
Wheels of Chance,” with its 1896. heroine
pedalling through England clad in grey
“bloomers,” seems like an echo of some, other
existence. The pneumatic-tyred 60-mile-an-
hour motor-car, whose grandfather was the
freakish “auto” that raised a laugh at the
forgotten sports, is now the hooting, dusty
king of the road and its poor relation,. the
sputtering motor-cycle, can do what little
cycle track-racing is required. There is
much newspaper talk of the indefatigable
nation called Germany; a wonderful new
hybrid fighting-ship, described as a “battle-
cruiser” and called the Indefatigable, has
just been commissioned; and the indefati-
gable secretary, his outdoor occupation gone,
is understood to be practising indefatiga-
bility in a modified form in the gloomy pri-
vacy of his club-rooms. No more sunny
afternoons in vice-regal society on the clipped
grass; no more glorious publicity; only the
dreary round of club duties on a moderate
salary, varied by an occasional drink at the
bar or a game of billiards in front of the
1887 young men who stand so stiffly in their
uniforms besides their tall “ordinaries.” In
his lonely moments the jiot-so-indefatigable
but paid secretary thinks those relics of
better days would be better burnt. Some
of the originals are dead, others have dropped
out and a remnant “drop in occasionally”—
presumably to prove they are not dead like
the sport.
One last leap to war-worn 1916. The
indefatigable Germany, that set out at last
after many blustering threats to conquer
the world, appears after two years of fight-
ing as a haggard, hard-pressed earth-dweller,
weary to death of blood and agony, and fight-
ing on merely for what is left of national
honor and pride; the oil-streaked North Sea
has closed in whirlpools over the 'wreck of
the great Indefatigable battle-cruiser; and
the indefatigable secretary was buried
yesterday!
Nothing is indefatigable—nothing lasts
for ever. Pride must have its fall sooner
or later, and to typify the Machine’s victory
over the Man. I would picture Time as "a
fallen and very fatigable bicyclist with his
velocipede lying on top of him.

Cured to Stay Cured.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
FROM NEWTOWN.
Mr. W. 11. Jeffries, King Street, Newtown,
Sydney, says: “About five years ago my kidneys
commenced to bother me, no doubt brought on from
hard work, such as lifting and bending over at my
work. My back was lame and aching, and this
handicapped me a lot, for it was a difficult matter
to stoop and caused increased pain. I tried a good
many remedies, but they did me no good. A friend
advised me to take Doan’s Backache Kidney Bills, so
I sent for some. I used them as directed, and when
I had taken about half a bottle I knew they were
benefiting me. Thus encouraged, I continued with
the treatment until I was quite cured, and 1 have not
felt the slightest sign of backache since. Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills have made a different man
of me, and I recommend them to all who suffer with
backache.”
Seven years later Mr. Jeffries says: “Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills cured me of backache seven
years ago, and I am still free of this trying ailment.
I need say no more; my lasting cure speaks for itself.”
FROM SURRY HILLS
Mrs. H. Sturgeon, 70 Marlborough Street, Surry
Hills, Sydney, says: “It gives me great pleasure to
say a few words in praise of Doan’s Backache -Kid-
ney Pills. For a good while I was a martyr to kid-
ney trouble, the symptoms being backache, urinary
disorders and dizzy attacks. My back ached fear-
fully, and every movement was accompanied with a
twinge like the stab of a knife. The kidney secre-
tions were cloudy and scalded a good deal in passing,
this symptom clearly showing my kidneys were very
much out of order. I heard good reports of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, so decided to give them a
trial. The first bottle gave me relief, and by the
time I had used three bottles I was cured, and I
have been well ever since, a period of over twelve
months.”
Mrs. Sturgeon confirms the above two years later:
“My cure still holds good, no sign of kidney dis-
order having returned since I took Doan’s Backache
Kidney Tills three years ago.”

“/"~\NE, two, three; one, two three; a
® 9 quaver, not a minim. Three in a
bar, three in a bar! You play
ten. Ooh ! Madre di madonna! Read the
music, read the music.”
Allegro Maggiori threaded a bush of
aitistic hair with two nervous hands; his
pupil gulped down a tear or two, then began
afresh to punish the piano. She played a
few bars, looked nervously at the threaten-
ing countenance of her teacher, and then,
determined to do or die, gathered all of her
strength into ten pudgy little fingers and
smote the keyboard as though she hated it.
Faster and faster flew her hands, and, like
a startled horse bolting through some un-
reasonable fear, she lost all sense of rhythm,
time and tune, dispensed with the printed
music before her, and introduced into her
playing sounds and sentences that never
were. Coming to a sudden halt, she ended
on a chord that sounded like an inverted “z,”
all bleary at Ihe edges.
Allegro was quiet for a few moments
only because his gorge was rising enough to
suffocate all speech. He was rapidly
changing from pink to purple, from purple
to a dull red when speech came to him.
“You play like fiend of Hell; you play
hymning chinkies in iron foundry. Y'ou
tread on my heart, Signorina. You kill my
soul.”
He threw out his hands despairingly.
“You kill my soul.”
Noting the Italian’s air of growing dejec-
tion, Amelia, the pupil, arose from her
position on the piano-stool; and Amelia, the
perky, self-satisfied, domestic tyrant took her
place. Now, in her home Amelia’s perki-
ness was a source of constant annoyance to
her parents. They had tried to cure her
of it by placing her at boarding-school; but
had found to their sorrow that the Young
Ladies’ Seminary accelerated their wayward
daughter’s adoption of modern freaks, fan-
cies and flirtations, rather than the sober-
ing principles of Euclid and longer division
and the wowser belief in early sleeping and
rising. Returning from boarding-school,
Amelia, more porky than ever, annoyed her
parents exceedingly; so much so that
they sought as sanctuary the discipline of a
business college, „and forced the erring
daughter to devote to it six hours of every
day. But, after having attended for ap-
proximately three weeks and six days,
Amelia was discovered painting her lips and
conversing of evenings on the ’phone to the
typewriter man. This provoked greater
censure in the family bosom; the parental
heads, friendly over a supper cup of tea,
devised a scheme of ridding Amelia forever
of her effervescence, her spontaneity, her
careless youth—a crime in some well-ordered
homes.
On one of his jaunts in a neighboring sub-
urb Amelia’s father had s<?»n this ambitious
sign—
Allgero Maggiori, teacher of piano, violin, ’cello,
viola, flute, organ, concertina, ovgan-of-the-moutb,
fugue, counterpoint, and other instruments.
The sign, silver and blue, jutted from the
second-floor window of a dwelling whose
exterior promised but a sordid lining.
Remembering this, said the father to his
mate: “Music is a genteel profession,
Amelia can take pupils in the suburb

hands and said, “Ah ! Music from the iron-
works.”
Amelia swung round on the music-stool
and defiantly tilted her chin. “I’ve beaten
ma and pa, anyhow,” she said. “I never
did want to be a music-ianer. I—l—want
to marry the typewriter and have babies.”
“Ma! ■ Signorina, you are my living.
Your pa, he say, ‘Make of my girl a music-
teacher.’ I agree; he pay me three, six
pounds advance. I buy handsome suit of
clothes; I buy of the red wine ; I buy spag-
hetti enough for the cruel winter; I pay
two, three week rent. Now”—he shrugged
his 'shoulders —“now I am but a pauper,
Signorina. Poveretto mio ! I am to starve.
I am a pauper, a swindler. I cannot pay
back the money.” lie gestured despair
again. Remorse stirred in the diaphragm of
Amelia. She. would have executed a fandango
in double time could the music-lessons have
ceased then and there. But a voice within
called to her to shoulder the noisy burden
of flats, sharps, keys and rhythms, and lift
her old master above difficulty.
She laid a faltering hand on tin 1 shaggy,
downbent head.
“I haven’t learned the drums or mouth-
organ, Signor,” she said, indicating in a
far corner of the room the timpani almost
submerged in dust and cobwebs. Allegro,
the pessimist, raised his head.
“The trombone kill your father’s ear,
Signorina; the timpani kill his head; the
organ of the mouth for nasty little boys
alone. There is nothing that I may teach,
nothing, nothing.”
That night Allegro smoked several cheap
cheroots, paced his room, tore his hair, and
said many times, “Dio mio! Dio mio!” Nor
could he solve the problems of how to keep
his job, or, in the event of losing it. refund
the money to Amelia’s exacting papa.
Many schemes asserted themselves only to
be banished when, with the dawn, reason
came.
But in the morning there was breakfast,
and with it came inspiration.
“Cooking it shall be,” cried Allegro, and
kissed the spaghetti bowl.
And so it happened that Amelia, exponent
of the flute and piccolo, lady high execu-
tioner of the violin, harp and piano, pirate
of the trombone and slayer of the ’cello,
became Amelia the cook in all modes and
manners, with 10 kitchens to the right of
her and to the left 10 spaghetti storerooms.
For Amelia, after three of Maggiori’s lessons
in foreign garlicised cooking, showed a re-
markable talent for mixing oils ; and Allegro,
declaring that it was only another form of
artistry, abandoned his pipes and tabors for
the salad-making trade.
Amelia’s perkiness was never cured, for
as a successful cook she proved the—philo-
sophv of reaching the heart through the
stomach, and brought the hitherto dicta-
torial parents into an attitude of becoming
subjection.
Also, with a stew of garnished galahs she
won the typewriter, and so attained her
life’s ambition. And through her success
Allegro Maggiorf learned his lessonhe sold
his musical instruments for twenty-five
shillings the lot to the Yiddish proprietor of
a monte-de-piete. and changed his sign to
that of a restaurant-keeper.
“For,” said Allegro, “ ’tis better to be a
good cook than a bad musician.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WENT into the city streets at night,
Where women of my kind must seek
their hire,
With pride of beauty and its lustful might,
My eyes shone gleaming with a smouldering
fire.
For there was one I had set forth to meet,
A man whose princely worth and wealth and
fame,
Could lift me from the level of the street
And gild the ringing of my brazen name.
I walked with head held high upon my way,
Rehearsing many a telling act or phrase,
As “this” I planned to do, and “that” to
say.
I laughed low in my soft scarf’s golden haze.
Beneath the bright arc-light there stood at
gaze
A baby boy with bare feet slim and brown,
Alone in that heart of the traffic maze,
Stunned with the strident uproar of the
town.
lie was so small my heart went out to him.
“My little one, ’tis time you were a-bed.”
I stooped, my eyes with sudden tears were
dim,
And pressed my cheek against his silky head.
Against my painted cheek he brushed his
lips,
And whispered softly: “Won’t you under-
stand T'
He held apart his fragile fingertips
To show the cruel wound within each hand.
Two gouts of red gleamed on the pavement
stone,
From little feet with agony bled white.
“Oh, draw me close, I weep to be alone,”
lie said, while from my eager, aching sight
The hot tears fell on blooded hands and feet
And washed their wounds of dust and crim-
son stain,
While brain and soul swept the new thought
to greet,
And peace of heart wrapped me about again.
O mother-heart! O Child that walks the
earth !
Making together one great golden rhyme!
In Heaven, or stable, the Eternal Birth
Cleanses the world of the red stains of time.
