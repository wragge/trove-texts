An Angry Woman.
‘‘Marie Corelli ’’ sauces platitudes with rhetoric,
*nd finds that the middle-class mind approves the
mixture. She trades on the Great Secret which
successful authors early discover—that there is
nothing the mass of reader’s hate and distrust
more than originality. What they wish is to have
their own tame, ordinary thoughts dressed up in
better language than they can command, but not
better than they can appreciate, or think they
appreciate. Then is established that sympathy
between the ordinary author and the ordinary
reader so gratifying to the latter —who enjoys a
pleasure akin to the pleasure of the tremendous
‘ Told you so ! ” when his own familiar common-
places recur with a sparkle. As the reader has
fathered the thought, he is not jealous of a brilli-
ance which he knows he might have fathered
himself—if he had only taken the trouble, you
know.
* * * *
Marie Corel; i’s platitudes are an awesome sight.
Sober, portentous, paradoxical—she has every
variety at command.
A moneyless man, if he wins a woman’s love, knows
that such love is genuine and untainted by self-interest;
but a rich man can never be truly certain of love at all;
Generally it is the moneyless man or woman who is
endowed with this unpurchaseable power—this indepen-
dence of action and indifference to opinion—the wealthy
seldom do anything but spend or hoard.
If there is one human being more than another that I
utterly abhor, it is the type of man so common to the
present tune, the man who huddles his own loathly vices
under a cloak of assumed broadmindedness and virtue.
How exceedingly new and interesting !
* * * *
Of Marie Corelli and her decorated dullness all
reputable English critics have fallen foul —-to their
credit. And Marie, sulking always, has in her
new book burst out into something intended to be
flaming satire, but which really has not enough
wit to be mildly amusing. “ The Sorrows of
Satan,” sweet Marie’s tit-for-oritical-tats, is an
assault upon reviewers large and small, plain and
fancy, literary and illiterate. It is prefaced by
this “ Special Notice ” .-
No copies of this book are sent out for review. Mem-
bers of the press will therefore obtain it (should they wish
to do so) in the usual way with the rest of the public—
i.e., through the booksellers and libraries.
Unluckily, this meant-to-be-impressive announce-
ment has only earned guffaws.
♦ » » »
There is in “ The Sorrows of Satan ” absolutely
not one gleam of strength or novelty—its only
interest is derived from the fuming author’s
grimaces and posturings, and these soon pall. But
under a thin disguise she gives a picture of her-
self—as the critics ought to see her—and hints
why those jealous persons deliberately turn their
, backs to the glory of the rising sun.
What power had s® gifted this author--this mere
woman [says the wicked male rival]—that she should
dare to write better than I! And that she should force
me, by the magic of her pen, to mentally acknowledge,
albeit with wrath and shame, my own inferiority!
Clearness of thought, brilliancy of style, beauty of diction,
all these were hers, united to consummate ease of .expres-
sion and artistic skill—and all at onoe, in the very midst
of reading, such a violent impulse of insensate rage pos-
sessed me that I flung the book down, dreading to go on
with it. The potent, resistless, unpurchaseable quality of
Genius I
These you have it. Miss Genius-Mackay-Oorelli-
Clar? casts her pearls before the critical swine,
who tread them contemptuously underfoot. Then
she improves on the old ending of the parable by
burning and rending the swine !
Some Recent Publications.
“ Phil May’s Sketch-Book ” (125.) is a collection
of 50 of the well-known artist’s cartoons, which
will doubtless find a place on many* Australian
dub and drawing-room tables. The fine folio
volume contains some of the best of May’s recent
work ; and gems like “ Give us a bit of yer apple,
Billy,” or “ Petticoat Lane,” can dare any rivalry.
The volume is prefaced by the artist’s note on
himself contributed to London Sketch in ’93.
Part is worth reviving :
I never had a drawing lesson in my life, but I can’t
remember a time when I didn’t draw. At the time of the
Franco-German war, when I was a child of three or four
[this makes Phil about 28 or 29—he’s getting old I], I used
to draw imaginary pictures of the battles—bristling
bayonets, cannonade, and smoke—more particularly
smoke. Later I drew portraits of the actors and
actresses who played at Leeds, where I lived.
When I was 16 I made up my mind to come to
London, and see whether I couldn’t make a living with
«ny pencil. So I took a ticket, third-class single, and
tried my fortune, It was a hard fight. I had no friends
and no introductions worth speaking of. There were
comparatively few illustrated papers in those days, and
prices ranged very low. I had a good many bad quarters
of an hour. Once, I remember, I was in such a desperate
n)°od 1 seriously contemplated burgling a coffee-
stall—fortunately there was a policeman near, so I did
not. But in six months I was beginning to get on. I
worked for Society, the Penny Illustrated Paper, the
St. Stephen’s Review, and the Pictoral World. In Nov.,
’B5, I went to Australia to join the staff of the Sydney
Bulletin, stayed there three years, and afterwards lived
m Paris, until I began my work for the Daily Graphic.
A. Mary F. Robinson’s striking little life of
Emily Bronte is not very recent, but it holds a
permanent place in “ Bronte ” literature, and re-
publication in the cheap “Eminent Women”
series (Is. 6d.) gives the fifth edition a chance to
charm a still wider circle of readers. The book
gives much more information regarding the whole
family than Mrs. Gaskell’s life of Charlotte, and
is 10 times abler than that affectionate but incom-
petent tribute. Two sentences apropos the
Brontes’ parentage, of which Madame Darmsteter
grasped some, but not the full meaning :
Insanity and genius stand on either side consumption,
its worse and better angels. Let none call it impious or
absurd to rank the greatest gift to mankind as the occa-
sional result of an inherited tendency to tubercular
disease.
H. P. Woodward, Westralian Govt, geologist,
issues a second edition of his very useful “ Mining
Handbook,” which not only deals with Westralian
mines _ and minerals, but gives much general
geological and other information. The pre-
face is dated June 25, so publication is nearly six
months late, and the current mining information
is not of much value. In any case, a Govt, geolo-
gist must walk warily. Thus only two or three
ominous lines apiece are devoted to the London-
derry and the Wealth of Nations, concerning
which (very judiciously) “ there are no officia
reports. ’ Both mines, however, are described as
“ celebrated ” (“ notorious ” would be apter), and
of the Londonderry it is said that “the reported
discovery of another pocket deeper in the mine
has re-established confidence ” —which is mis-
leading, as well as stale. Of Bayley’s, Mr. Wood-
ward remarks: —
A great amount of work has been’done on this mine. A
shaft over 380 ft. deep has been sunk, and the continuance
of the already world-famous ore-shoot proved. Drives on
several levels have been driven from where a surprisingly
large amount of gold-bearing stone has been raised, as
well as exposing large quantities. The principal produc-
tive and preparatory work has been executed in and ad-
joining the great ore-shoot, which work is a great credit
to those who have planned and executed it under the
existing circumstances, but the mine requires far greater
exertions in the near future, since it would be only jus-
tice to the richness of the ore-deposit (!) and to the good
work already performed, if steps are to be taken to secure
the future greatness of this celebrated [encore cele-
brated ! ] gold mine.
Not a word of the continued fall in quantity and
quality of erushings, or in share values and quota-
tions ! Mr. Woodward may explain that his
notice is six months old, but if it could not be pub-
lished when it was written (and it wasn’t too
appropriate then) it should have been cut out alto-
gether, or marked as unreliable on an errata page.
The weight of Govt, authority should not be given
to such incomplete or inaccurate statements,
which make the section containing them the least
satisfactory in Mr. Woodward’s book.
No. 3 in George Robertson and Co.’s Amateur
Series is “ Australian Amateur Gardening,” by
J. J. Mortlook (Is. 3d.). It is difficult to say much
that is novel on such a subject, but the informa-
tion is sound and well put; though the reader’s
locality must guide him in its application. The
same publishers issue No. 2 of Violet’s Musical
Album (Is. 2d.), containing several currently
popular comic songs and ballads, with some old
favorites.
“Recognition,” a novel by Sydney H. Wright,
of Fremantle (W.A.), pleads somewhat tardily for
notice. It is long, fluent, conventional, and dull
—an exception being made as to the portions in
which the author presumably describes his Wes r
tralian surveying experiences. These have some
local interest. The book, by the way, is already
in a second edition ; but how many (Mane Corelli
might ask) did the first edition number ?
“Lot 13,” by Dorothea Gerard, appears in Bell’s
Col. Library (35., 45.). The tale is not quite so
attractive as the same author’s “ Lady Baby,” but
it is readable.
S. Baring-Gould, the author of “Fairy Tales
Re-Told ” in Methuen’s Col. Library, has given
some charming versions of the race-old fairy favor-
ites —and no more precious Christmas gift could
be handed to the children whom the fairies love.
The writer congratulates himself on saving young
eyes by printing his stories in thick antique type,
but the absence of extra space between the lines
and words is a serious fault.
Violet Hunt has taken front-rank among the
new dialogue-makers, and her book, “ A Hard
Woman ” (35., 45.), still running serially in Chap-
man’s Magazine, is very well worth reading. It
is brilliant and interesting—and more, it strikes
one as a truthful study of a not uncommon type—
the society woman who embodies selfishness and
makes the nether millstone seem ridiculously soft.
Periodicals.
Perhaps the most attractive article in Dec. Scrib-
ner's is the sketch of Alma-Tadema, admirably
illustrated from some of his best pictures. There
is a plenitude of stories ; but, as is too often the
way with American stories, most are more cultured
than interesting.
Sydney Town and Country Journal pub-
lishes an unblushing parody of Leighton’s
“ Wedded ” as a Christmas colored supplement —
crudely conventionalised and labelled “The First
Kiss.” It has apparently been printed abroad,
and the copyist had the grace to omit his name.
More creditable to art are the clever sketches to
illustrate Ethel Turner’s dream of Sydney’s future
—though the North Head statue, poised on a
trumpery little ornamental building, is obviously
out of taste. The fewer architectural trivialities
pasted on North Head, the better; though a
statue gigantically, sombrely, severely cut might
conceivably harmonise with its massive grandeur.
The new series of the Lcdgate Magazine opens
well with the admirable Nov. number (9d). A
feature is the pictorial history of the previous
month, reproducing many fine photographs. From
an article on authors’ own favorite books one
learns that Besant prefers “ Children of Gibeon,”
“ For Faith and Freedom,” and “ The Revolt of
Man.” Doyle is “least dissatisfied” with
“The White Company’’and “The Stark-Munro
Letters ; ” and Weyman properly chooses “ The
Gentleman of France” ana “The Red Robe.”
' ■ NOTES. ■
Ethel Turner’s “Story of a Baby ” now appears
m paper-covers at Is. lOd. Publishers Dent and
<jG y »y the bye, wail piteously that the size and
style of their “ Iris ” library has been shockingly-
cribbed for the “ Nautilus 5 series ; but their bitter
cry, though it lyings an echo from the Saturday
Review, gets no response from the guilty “others.”
And there is no copyright in edition-ideas.
, Some further extracts from Nordau’s “Degenera-
tion ’ (ss. 9d.) which possibly have Australian
relevance:
M. A. Binet declares that “it is the odours of the
human body which are the causes responsible for a cer-
tain number of marriages contracted by clever men with
female subordinates belonging to their households. For
certain men, the most essential thing in a woman is not
beauty, mind, or elevation of character : it is her smell! ”
Again, apropos the frequent hysterical young per-
son, with the sex suited to local conditions ;
The hysterical person’s own “ I ” towers up before her
y> Blon ’ a,l< y 80 completely tills her mental horizon
that it conceals the whole of the remaining uni-
verse. She cannot endure that others should ignore
her. She desires to be as important to her fellows
as she is to herself. “An incessant need pursues the
hysterical—to busy those about them with themselves.”
A means of satisfying this need is the fabrication of stories
by which they become interesting. Hence come the
adventurous occurrences which often enough occupy
the police and the reports of the daily press. In
the busiest thoroughfare the hysterical person is set
upon, maltreated and wounded, dragged to a distant
place, and left to die. She picks herself up painfully, and
informs the police. - She can show the wounds on her
body. She gives all the details. And there is not a single
word of truth in the whole story : it is all dreamt and
imagined. She has herself inflicted her wounds in order
for a short time to become the centre of public attention.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne's Bronchitis cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain. .

“Mr. W. G. Hearne, ,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it la the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it: he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo. . .
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.” , . ...
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle ot his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three mooths
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYAii,

it, —Yours faithfully. J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-

Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in Ins
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely : —Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fearof something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, <vc.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt op 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,

fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE FOUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
debility,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your ease, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.

remedies, and never, under any oircutnstanoes,
prescribes Mercury in any form.

THE “MADDING" CROWD 1
THE VITAL SPARK!
The near approach of Xmas Day is bringing
tens of thousands to our stores from far and near,
people who have been there before, and folk who
for the first time have been vouchsafed that wis-
dom which impels so many to steer for the Hay-
market. Our arrangements for the special wants
of the festive season have this j ear been on an extra
liberal scale, and the comfort of our customers has
been ministered to, in no small degree, by recent
improvements. Thus, as a consequence, ample
space, so essentially necessary to successful shop-
ping operations, is at command, while that leisurely
inspection of purchases, only to be accomplished
in the absence of undue noise and bustle, is
afforded to all on business bent. And yet there
are not wanting signs that before our doors close
on XMAS EVE, the capacity of
OUB IMMENSE WAREHOUSES
As well as our desire, and that of our willing
assistants, to do their level best, will be taxed to
the utmost. The position may well be likened to
that of a great national gathering upon the occa-
sion of some popular demonstration. A great
man mounts the platform to speak, and as he
proceeds the crowd warm to his utterances.
Cheer after cheer follows his glowing words, when
as he nears the end, and, in fervid language, sets
the nation’s course and proclaims the people’s
destiny, with one accord the masses rise and cheer
the speaker to the echo, till there is danger of
some precious words escaping ears whose owners
long to profit by them.
THE VITAL SPARK
The life-giving fire of Low Prices for the best of
everything, has set the town aflame and stirred
each Xmas buyer to come to us. Since ihe Xmas
trade opened in the first week of the month there
has been, day by day, a steady increase in our
trade. And so it will be. Customer s will multiply,
till when Xmas Eve comes, from far and near,
from suburbs and city and township, from village
and mountainside, from every point of the compass
and every part of the colony, everybody, impelled
by a mighty enthusiasm and urged by the solemn
conviction that it’s the proper thing to do, will
have done their Xmas shopping, or be going to do
it, at our store.

Why Suffer One Moment
From Torturing Skin Diseases
When a single application of the Cuticura Remedies will, in

and humor remedies, are absolutely
pure, and may be used by the
youngest and most delicate with
gratifying and unfailing success.

The War Republic.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hail to the War Republic of wide-extending
sway ;
Hail to the Gaul, his glory shall never pass away.
Ho, for the tameless heroes who stemmed the
Teuton flood,
And won the Fortress back for France in rivers of
their blood ;
Away with gloom and sorrow and banish sad
regrets,
Your Teuton foe is humbled —your leaguer is in
Metz !
These were no conscript levies whose might you
brake to-day;
Von Moltke’s own war-eagles and ravening for
their prey!
But warring France spurned base recoil e’en
shell-swept breach before.
The sword of Justice struck and turned the scales
of bloody war,
And now your lot is glorious, whatever fate besets,
Your Teuton foe is humbled—your leaguer is in
Metz !
In vain the great war-engines of Krupp and
Nordenfeldt
Essayed to keep the open breach against the
warring Celt ;
In vain the great war engines belched forth the
fatal flame,
No slack Bazaine was there to sell an army corps
to shame.
Your own the cherished jewels, what though the
foeman frets ; (
Your Teuton foe is humbled—your leaguer is ifi
Metz !
The spirit of Napoleon is in your ranks to-day,
The chivalry of Bayard, the £lan of Desaix ;
And loud your gallant actions speak, ye are no
common men—
The warrior brood of Conde and the kinsmen of
Turenne.
Each deed upon your roll of fame yet nobler one
begets—
Your Teuton foe is humbled, your leaguer is in
Metz!
de lys has fluttered o’er many a glorious
plain ;
The tricoleur is planted on hecatombs of slain !_
That awful carnage Jena that broke the Prussian
sway
Was bloodless to the shambles the Lebel made
to-day !
Your star soars proudly heavenward, the hostile
meteor sets —
Your Teuton foe is humbled, your leaguer is in
Metz.
Then praise the God of battle, who fought your
ranks before!
Hail to the sword of Justice that turned the scales
l of war !
I Ho, for the gallant heroes who won you back
again,
Your sunny crown of glory, “fair Alsace and
Lorraine.’’
Away, away with sorrow, and banish sad regrets,
Sedan no longer carries shame, your leaguer is in
Metz !

A tnleraina ! Year 1 ; stray dog quarters
himself upon Sydney householder, and is knocked
on the head to avoid registration—whereupon
owner turns up and gets verdict for £ 2, value of
deceased. Year 2 ; another waif attaches himself
to establishment, and householder gets him regis-
tered—whereupon up bobs his owner and has to
be bought off a prosecution for “unlawful deten-
tion,” as evidenced by registration. Year 3;
third car appoints himself family-tyke, and house-
holder-afraid, this time, either to destroy or
register—is promptly summoned and fined for
“ keeping an unregistered dog.” This “ disaster-
dogged ” person should tie up his next canine
visitor—read him Fitzgibbon’s Brassey-poem—
and let him loose. He’d see no more of that dog,
at all events !
Down South the other day a lot of people
of local consequence conspired in a practical joke
upon an old identity, notorious as the most
cantankerous and unsoci ible hunks south of the.
lj ne —cordially and cheerfully detested by all the
“ grown-ups,” and used as the local bogey-man for
the moral benefit of all “the kids. fhe idea of
the conspiracy was to invite the grim old hard-
shell to a banquet tendered in his honor, in recog-
nition of his great popularity, and to treat him
just as if he really were a beloved object. The
affair required delicate handling, but it came off,
and the soured antique,was filled up with luxurious
food and noble liquors, and sat hard and cold
whilst half-a-dozen prominent citizens gravely
extolled his virtues and praised him for his
philanthropy, urbanity, and numerous beautiful
and endearing characteristics as a man and a
brother. Then the shellback was called upon to
respond; and he elevated himself, and looked
round upon the assemblage with a critical light in
his eye. “Gentlemen,” he said, “I thank you
for ail the kind things you have said about me,
but, you 1 do you really mean it? ”

Adopted by DIXSON&SONS.for their
HighestCrade.Mild Plug Tobacco.
YANKEE ‘ DOODLE .
“YANKEE DOODLE ” is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobacco that has ever
appeared here, and it has won greater success during the short time it has been on the market than
anything previously. This is no idle boast, and, to prove it, any smoker can test the statement, for
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its sale
has this year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this?
Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes, after
years of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended and
exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf is
forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he has
been accustomed to. DIXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-century to accomplish this; and, as
their leading business has been built up on their reputation for QUALITY, they could not afford tc
make the foiegoing statement if any doubt existed. DIXSON & SONS, who use more American leaf
than all the other T"ba co Factories combined, tire noted for several high-class brands; —“CON-
QUEHOR,” “SIR ROGER,” “CHAMPION,” and “DOLLAR;” but “YANKEE DOODLE’
ranks supreme.

Total, in seven years, 18 ships, and (giving the
last two the average of their predecessors) 371
lives lost.
• • • •
But these are not all. Daring the current
year, three more vessels have been missing so
long that they are practically classed with the
others. Their names are :
B|Noddleburn, 1081 tons, sailed from Newcastle to Toco-
pilla, June 25.
Lady Lawrence, 1482 tons, from Newcastle to Val-
paraiso, July 11.
King Arthur, 1647 tons, Newcastle to Valparaiso,
August 1.
The ordinary London rate of re-insurance on
the cargoes of these vessels would be about 30s.
per cent. On Oct. 11 the rates respectively
quoted for them at Lloyd’s were :
Noddleburn, 75 guineas.
Lady Lawrence, 50 guineas. v
King Arthur, 25 guineas.
That shows the underwriters’ estimation of
their chances of ever seeing port. Give them
crews in*the same ratio as the others, and the
sum works out: —
7 years ; 21 ships ; 431 lives.
Or three ships and 61 lives per annum since
1888 !
• • • •
Mark this: these figures do not include
vessels known to be burnt, or foundered, or
wrecked. The list is simply a list of ships
“ missing at Lloyd’s” —ships which have sailed
gaily out of p »rt and been swallowed up by the
ocean, without leaving one man, one spar, one
sail or plank or chip, to tell the tale of their
destruction.
• * * ♦
How do the figures compare with those of
other ports? Take Sydney. Oat of Sydney,
every year during the last seven years, have
sailed from 1500 to 1700 vessels—from twice to
thrice as many as have left Newcastle in the
same period. Only one has gone missing—the
Aeolus in 1894. One!—and at Newcastle 21,
though the vessels leaving Newcastle number
not one-half of those leaving Sydney ! During
the last quarter of a century but three ships in
all have been reported “missing” from Sydney
the Strathnever, the Santa Cruz, and the
Aeolus—three out of 40,000 departed. In
Sydney, three in 25 years ; in Newcastle, 21 in
seven ! Is there no significance here ?
• • • • •
Compare other coal ports. Figures from
1893 are not available, but in the seven years
to 1893, there were reported “missing” from
Swansea, one vessel ; from he Tyne, 12; from
Caidiff, two; from Liverpool, four. From all
the ports of Britain, during seven years, 27
missing coal-laden vessels were reported ; from
the single port of Newcastle, N.S. W., during
seven years, 21 missing coal-laden vessels were
reported ! Yet the average number of coal-
laden vessels annually leaving British ports is
not less than 15 times the number of vessels
leaving Newcastle, N.S. W. Is there no signifi-
cance here ?
• • • •
What is it gives Newcastle this evil pre-
eminence ? The comparison with Sydney seems
to show that coal cargoes are far more
dangerous than wool or general cargoes. The
comparison with Britain seems to show that
there is far more risk in carrying coals from
Newcastle than from any British port. Under-
writers everywhere admit that such is the case.
It is impossible to get insurance for a Newcastle
cargo at Sydney cargo rates. It is almost
impossible to get re insurance at all. Some
of the best companies decline to take the
business at any price. And the unanimous
opinion of competent and unbiassed persons
who have considered the facts is that the
method of slowing Newcastle coal cargoes is
almost wholly to blame for the exceptional loss
of ships and life. There is no compulsory sur-
vey ; the co ils are not properly trimmed ;
“ shifting boards ” and “ side hatches ” are the
exception rather than the rule ; and in the first
rough weather the coals rattle over to leeward,
and down the vessel goes till the Day of
Judgment !
• • • •
A little explanation will make this clear to
the non-nantical reader. Most cargo ships
have two decks, a ’tween deck and an upper
deck. The coals are stowed in the hull beneath
the upper deck, and the Tween deck divides
the space horizontally into two compart-
ments. Sometimes the ’tween deck is a mere
framework of joists ; more often it is boarded
in, and there is a hatchway in the centre. The
coal is supposed to be trimmed level and packed
tightly, so that it will not shift and the ship
will rest upon an even keel. If it is not well
trimmed and properly packed, when the ship
rolls with the shock of a sea the coal rolls with
her and throws her on her side, or topples her
over altogether. So narrow are modern ships in
proportion to length, and such weight is in
their iron masts and top hamper, that once
overbalanced they can rarely recover, and so
they founder before there is time even to
launch a boat. In that way, it cannot be
doubted, most of the missing Newcastle vessels
have mot their fate. One of them, the Portal-
loch, so hurled on to her beam-ends by a heavy
sea, survived to tell thestory. Thecrew w ere able
to trim the coals again, and she returned to port.
The mate stated that the coals were so badly
stowed that they could walk over the top of
them ’tween decks, and all round them as well.
That is to say, instead of the cargo filling the
whole of the space ’tween decks, and thus being
unable to shift with the rolling and plunging of
the vessel, the coals had been practically thrown
in a heap in the centre, with a considerable
space between them and the vessel’s sides, and
a space of 30ft. or 40ft. between them and the
for’ard bulkhead. Thus when the ship lay over
on the port tack the coals all fell to starboard,
and when she went about again they were
once more thrown violently across to leeward.
In bad weather the cargo was shifting all the
time, and as it crashed against the ship’s sides
it sounded, said the mate, like a discharge of
heavy artillery.
• ♦ ♦ *
The suggested remedies for bad trimming
are “shifting boards” and “side hatches.”
“ Shifting boards ” are a vertical partition
built along the cargo-chamber, and secured so
that the coals cannot roll from side to side of
the vessel. “ Side hatches ” are additional
openings in the Tw'een deck, next the vessel’s
sides, so that when she rolls the coals on one
side of the upper compartment will not fall
through the centre hatchway to the other side
of the ship, but will settle down straight and
tighten up the wdrole mass. But these things
imply a little additional expense and a little
additional trouble ; the want of them only
means the loss of a few lives; so they are not
often provided.
♦ ♦ ♦ •
The trimmers murder tbe sailors, and “com-
petition ” murders the trimmers. If their coal
cargoes had been properly trimmed probably
nine in ten of the missing Newcastle ships would
have reached port safely. But the men em-
ployed will not trim properly. As the coals
rise to the height of the deck it is obvious that
much labor and pains are required to stow
them tightly into the sides ; and this is where
the trimmers shirk the work and leave shifting
cargoes. Supervision—at the time—is practi-
cally impossible. The trimmers resent any
interference, and are apt to accidentally drop a
lump of coal upon an interloper which will
stretch him senseless. The ship’s officers know
this, and rarely or never venture below. The
stevedore takes the trimmers’ word that the
cargo is properly stowed, and the captam takes
the stevedore’s. Then the hatches are made
fast, and the vessel sets sail. Once in a dozen
times she comes back—like the Portal loch.
Nine times in a dozen times she gets fair gales
and fair stowage —and wins through, or she
wins through by good luck despite bad stowage.
Twice in a dozen times she gets rough weather
and bad stowage—and goes to the bottom.
♦ * * *
Newcastle people, uneasy at their black
record, sometimes argue against these facts.
They p dnt out that some of the missing vessels
have set out for South America, over a course
strewn with dangerous coral islets. May they
not have been wrecked fairly and squarely ?
Others again have been provided with “ shift-
ing boards,” and have disappeared nevertheless.
But these pleas can hardly lessen the force of
the damning figures which prove Newcastle a
sailors’ death-trap. Why do vessels from New-
castle alone, of all Australian ports, go missing
on the South American voyage? And, if some
vessels founder in spite of precautions, it is
reasonable therefore to omit precautions
altogether ?
• * * *
The defence of the trimmers is no defence,
but it is an explanation—and a disgrace to the
persons responsible. The trimmers say, and
say truly, that the price per ton paid them for
trimming coal will not allow them to do the
work well and live. Their pittance a few years
ago was 4d. per ton ; now it is l|d. or 2d.—less
even than the sum paid in cheap-labor Britain !
And it is noteworthy that the decrease in the
rate of trimmers’ wages is almost coincident with
the increase in the number of Newcastle ships
gone missing. From 1865 to 1888—24 years—
only seven missing vessels are recorded ; from
1889 to 1895—seven years —there are 21. And
it was soon after 1886 that there begun that
loss of Newcastle trade which has not yet been
made good. But, trade or none, Id. or 2d. in
the ton of coal is not value for 00 or 80 human
lives per annum.
• * * *
And such lives they are—the pick of the sea-
faring community ! Cautious sailors give New-
castle a wide berth ; daring ones take the first
ship that comes to hand, and trust to the chap-
ter of accidents. There is a strange reckless-
ness—apathy—fatalism—about a seaman, A
few months back the captain of one of the
vessels named above was talking of the voyage
he was goiiig to make. “She’sa cranky ship,”
he said, “ and it's a cranky cargo; I don’t
think we’ll ever see port.” “ Then why sail ?”
“ Well, there’s the wife and the youngsters,
you see, and a man can’t quarrel with his bread
and butler. If I throw up this ship because
I’m uneasy about her, who knows when I’ll get
another?” So he set sail—a month passed,
two months, three—and there came a line to
his wife, “The is reported missing at
Lloyd’s.” Poor widow ! poor orphans !
• • • »
The loss of nearly 500 sailors’lives in seven
years means misery to many widows and
orphans ; and if there is any value in evidence,
most of those men were murdered in cold
blood as surely as if they had been weighted
with a sack of coals and thrown into the sea.
Murdered by careless cargo trimmers, murdered
for want of proper precautions against careless
trimming of cargo, murdered by greedy owners
and agents fighting for the last farthing of
profit, murdered in the absence of the State
supervision which voteless sailors are always
the last class in the community to obtain.
* • • •
Yet it is undoubtedly the duty of Govern-
ment to interfere. Government surveyors in-
spect vessels and boilers ; Government paints a
Plimsoll mark and sees that a vessel is hot
overladen. But of what use are precautions
against ovcrlading when the lading is so
badly stowed that the vessel goes to the bottom
all the same ? There are already at Newcastle
Government officials and surveyors competent
to give a certificate that coal cargoes are pro-
perly trimmed. No vessel should be permitted
to leave port unless such a certificate, in
writing, is deposited with the port authorities.
Shifting-boards, side-hatches, and other neces-
sary precautions should be made compulsory.
While cargo is being loaded tbe surveyor
should be practically in command of the ship.
Trimmers have a knack of guarding against
after-survey by building a wall of coal around
the hollow spaces they leave. If the surveyor
suspects that the loading is not being done pro-
perly he should have power to order every soul
off the vessel while he satisfies himself by
examination. Any attempt to evade these con-
ditions should be . severely punished. As for
the trimmers, if the Government cannot directly
enforce a minimum wage for them it can easily,
as by far the largest coal-consumer, bring suffi-
cient pressure to bear to ensure that the men
are sufficiently paid for their labor.
* ♦ ♦ ♦
The facts here recited will be new to most
readers of The Bulletin —they are the stalest
of commonplaces at Newcastle, and familiar
enough in shipping and Parliamentary circles.
Six months ago, a return giving full particulars
of lost ships and lives was presented to N.S. W.
Parliament. Why, then, is nothing done?
Simply because the sailors, as already said, are
the Cinderellas of the working-classes, only too
thankful to get an occasional crust from Par-
liamentary bounty. Other Labor - members
represent the miners and wharf-laborers: no
Labor-member represents them, for—here to-
day and gone to.-morrow —the deep - sea
wanderers have no votes worth counting. So
there is practically a Parliamentary conspiracy
of silence in the matter of the risks they suffer.
The members who represent Property don’t
care to show how the reduction of trimmers’
wages has indirectly drowned nearly 500
men in the last seven years ; the members who
represent Labor don’t care to show that, what-
ever their excuse, for these deaths the trim-
mers—who have votes—are directly responsible.
And so the ury of the sailors beats vainly on
ears closed by interest or greed.
• • • •
Nevertheless, Parliament must move in the
matter at once. With four and five vessels going
missing every year from preventible causes ;
with an annual loss of upwards of 100 lives;
the matter cannot be shirked any longer. The
crime has become a national crime, and that it
should he tolerated in Australia puts every
Australian to shame.
A Chapter of Secret Political History.
When, by an artful manipulation of electoral
devices, the present Boodle Government of
Queensland succeeded in obtaining a majority
of seats with a minority of votes, the odds of
public opinion were against its long continuance
in office. The grossness of the Q.N. Bank
scandals weighed heavily on the souls of the
constituencies, and, amid the growing stench of
that and other matters, the party in power looked
anxiously around for a herring to place across
the trail. It was then that there occurred to it
the simple and happy idea of fomenting a
Labor disturbance, and the work proved prac-
ticable and easy. The pastoralists needed a
little urging, a little wheedling, but not much.
An agreement was offered to the bush workers
which it was known they would never accept—
so harsh the conditions, so great the reduction
in wages—and Boodlewraith sat back and
awaited results. They -soon came. In
district after district the men struck. At
the beginning, had the pastoralists or the
Govt, wished it, arbitration would have ended
the difficulty at once. But the cry of the
pastoralists, artfully egged on, was “No con-
ciliation ! ” The Govt, did not one thing to
bring about agreement. It sat and waited ;
while mysterious strangers came and went
about its Queen - street offices, and the
“ Secret Service Fund ” was called more and
more into requisition. Presently long tele-
grams came pouring in from the disturbed dis-
tricts to the metropolitan press telegrams
full of riots and outrages, breathing war and
revolution. The men on strike, absolutely
quiescent in their tents, through which moved
stealthily the Govt, spies, were astounded to
read how a brawl between two shearers became
the organised riot of two hundred—how the
foolish talk of an angry rouseabout while the
billy was boiling became a set speech applauded
by the whole camp.
» *. * *
Meanwhile, the Govt, talked largely of what
it was going to do in defence of the coun-
try, and did absolutely nothing—either to
bring about .an agreement or to stop the dis-
order to which the strike was evidently tend-
ing. The few police in the Western districts
were not reinforced, or were kept at absurd
tasks by special orders from the Govt, which
effectually crippled the hands of the Commis-
sioner. Stop the strike ! —it was the last thing
the Govt, wished. The strike was Boodle-
wraith’s salvation. Secure in the knowledge
that the “ outrages ” were one-half exaggerated
and one-half invented, and could be stopped
at any time by merely permitting the police to
do their duty, the Govt, pleasantly watched the
plot working. Already the propertied electors
were panic-stricken, and in the excitement of
the “Shearers’ War!” the Q.N. Bank was
forgotten. Presently, emboldened by the police
inaction, a few of the desperate characters who
make Western Queensland their home saw their
opportunity to wreak private grudges and
satisfy criminal instincts. Did they know that
they were working for Boodlewraith as well as
if they had been subsidised? It is impossible
to say, but woolshed after woolshed flamed ;
the telegrams from the Govt, agents manipu-
lating the wires grew every day more lurid ;
and nine out of ten of the coastal inhabitants
believed that any. day the “ rebels ” might ride
to the sack ot Brisbane.
♦ * * ♦
The panic was complete ; it was time for
the Government to act. Though all the time
the Commissioner of Police was prevented
from utilising to its fullest capacity the force
at his command, it was pretended that unheard-
of steps were necessary to quell the disorder.
A special magistrate was appointed ; the Q.
militia was called out; and the Coercion Act
was passed to suspend habeas corpus and enable
anyone to be arrested and gaoled on suspicion
and detained or released without trial ! The
men on strike could only look on hopelessly
and marvel. The few politicians who kept
their heads tried vainly to interpose—with the
Govt, organs in the press shrieking blood, lire,
and revolt every morning and evening.
The “ soldiers ” were solemnly trained out
to the west, and kept there for a
couple of months kangaroo-hunting and
feeding on tea and “ brownie,” while the
special magistrate looked in vain for something
to justify their interference. The moment the
Govt, showed it was really in earnest, and per-
mitted the police to be properly employed in
patrolling the country, instead of in guarding
cheap labor stations from (flie dangers of
attacks which never came, the disturbances
magically ceased. The few desperadoes—esti-
mated at a dozen in all !—who had done all the
mischief chuckled and went about their busi-
ness ; and after waiting till the w ages and
expenses of the militia totted up to nearly
,£50,000, so that the substantial bill might be
evidence of the substantial danger escaped from,
the Govt, solemnly recalled them, and dis-
tributed bonuses and praise. Boodlewraith
was the saviour of the country ! and it has
traded on its prowess ever since. Even now,
the agents of the Political Ass point to the
burnt woolsheds and the £50,000, and ask the
terrified elector with the brick cottage and the
quarter-acre allotment if he will support the
Labor-party in the face of that. Yet the
Labor-party," as shown, was entirely innocent,
and the main body oL-the strikers had neither
part in nor cognisance of the “ outrages ” com-
mitted in their name. Strike, outrages, expendi-
ture—the whole thing was almost entirely the
ingenious Boodlewraith’s "expedient to get
straight on the Q.N. Bank business, and to have
a card in hand which would trump anything
the Labor party played.
• * • •
The dodge has succeeded admirably. To the
strikers themselves and their sympathisers the
facts have, of course, been more or less known
all along. But their opponents practically
control the press, which disseminates Boodle-
wraithian ideas with persistent assiduity ; and
a majority of Queensland taxpayers probably
still believe that the 1894 strike was a real and
tangible danger, from which only the famed


“strength” of the Govt, saved them. Last
week’s exposure of the Govt, action in relation
to the report of the Commissioner of Police is,
however, calculated to open the eyes of even
the blindest supporters of Boodlewfaith. Q.
Parliament has learned that part of the
report of the Q. Commissioner of Police
for the year 1894 was suppressed by
CoL Secretary Tozer, and part objected
to apparently because it told too much
truth about the strike, and failed to give pro-
minence or endorsement to the legends which
have so much assisted the Govt. Wrote the
Commissioner :
I am inclined to believe that the burning of the sheds
was all done by one small band, the members of it being
unknown to the general body of the strikers, for if
generally known the rewards would long since have been
claimed, there being amongst the crowd a number of
“ spielers ” —shearers’ parasites—men who call themselves
shearers, and some of whom are expert hands, but whose
chief business is to plunder the real shearer by every
species of cheating, and who would not hesitate to sell
their best friends for a £5-note.
Here, from a Govt, official, the head of the
Eolice department, was testimony that the
ush laborers as a body were innocent of all
complicity in the outrages laid to their credit—
testimony naturally amounting to something
like treason in the eyes of a Govt, which lives
by declaring the direct opposite, and by de-
nouncing the Labor-party for crimes with
which it is well known that Party bad no
connection whatever ! The Commissioner pro-
ceeded :
Apart from the burning of woolsheds, the crimes com-
mitted were fewer and more trivial than the commence-
ment warranted
Tozer disapprovingly underlined the words in
italics. What ! make light of the Govt.’s sheet-
anchor ! But worse was to come :
the only serious offences being the mysterious
attack on Dagworth woolshed, where over 40 shots are
reported to have been exchanged [“were exchanged,”
was the alteration demanded by Tozer], but fortunately
none of the defenders were injured, and no traces or
tracks of the attacking party could be discovered next
morning-and the shooting of a man at Coombomartin.
• • • •
This reference to the alleged Dagworth
assault, when a number of persons, apparently
hysterical with terror, seem to have fired wildly
at gum-trees and “ ghosteses,” and were
astonished next morning to find that not the
least mark or trace of an attacking party
existed, was too much for the horrified Tozer.
He absolutely declined to pass it. And when
the Commissioner reached the Coercion Act,
and gave it one small paragraph, Tozer
cried, like Oliver Twist, for “more”—
presumably more outrages, more reference
to the heroic behavior of Tozer himself as
Minister for War, more “ jam ” tor the kanga-
roo-hunting militia, more visible alarm at the
bogus gulf into which, with the greatest
courage, Boodlewraith saved the province from
plunging. Wrote the Commissioner :
On 25th Sept, the “Peace Preservation Act” was
passed, and portions of the Mitchell district proclaimed
under it; but as matters had by this time become settled
[italics The Bulletin’s] it was not necessary to enforce
any oj its provisions [italics Tozer’s] ; it had, however,
done good, as, in anticipation of the powers it was sup-
posed would be given by it to magistrates and the police,
several of the most dangerous characters in the district
disappeared.
And then Tozer pled significantly for “ More ! ”
“ More,” apparently, the Commissioner could
not supply ; and the matter would presumably
have been kept quiet for good and all had not
Parliament dragged it into publicity.
• • • *
Apart from the light it casts on the Govt,
management of the strike, the incident is
notable as showing the means which Boodle-
wraith employs to cement its influence. Woe
betide the Govt, official who dares to disclose a
truth unpalatable to the Q. Govt, party!
“ Better were it for him that a millstone were
hanged about his neck, and he was cast into
the depths of the sea.” Fortunately, the Q.
Commissioner of Police has retired on a pension;
and the Govt, is powerless to make him twist
facts to suit its policy. Parliament talks of
appointing a committee of enquiry into the
matter ; but whatever fresh information is dis-
closed can hardly deepen further the black
significance of the present position.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Proposed Northern Territory Job.
The party in S.A. which is trying to work up
the movement for giving the Northern Territory
to a nigger-importing syndicate advances the
annual Territory deficit as the most solid
reason for the proposed transfer. The deficit
in question is not very large unless the Terri-
tory is debited with its own local Public Works
expenditure; the total accumulated shortage,
according to the S.A. Government balance-
sheet, is only £305,000. But the system of
keeping separate accounts for the Territory
brings this deficit prominently before the public
every year, and the syndicate-mongers con-
stantly point to it as a proof that the great
tropical country is a white elephant, and a
tolerably ugly one at that, and should be given
away to anybody who will take it. Meanwhile
the same process of reasoning applies equally
well to many other districts ; but because no
separate accounts are kept their deficits pass
unnoticed, and no one thinks of proposing
to hand them over to a co. of British
adventurers. The great desert region which
occupies almost all the eastern parts of Wes-
tralia has never paid for the very small amount
of administration it has received —it is an open
question whether it has even paid for the wear-
and-tear of the occasional policeman who goes
out there in pursuit of the very occasional
colored malefactor, and generally comes back
without him or with the wrong individual.
Nearly half of South Australia proper has never
yet paid working expenses ; the mailed districts
of Victoria for very many years didn’t yield
enough to cover the cost of their scanty postal
facilities and the salary of the magistrate who
fined the sparse local drunk, and other charges;
and a similar state of things has prevailed, if it
doesn’t prevail now, in the extreme east of
Gippsland, in Cape York Peninsula (Queens-
land), and in some of the West Coast districts
of Maoriland. In all these places, if separate
accounts were kept, it would be found that
they are, or have been, a burden on the tax-
payers of more settled regions, and the reason
why the Northern Territory should be given up
to a British syndicate, to become a preserve for
coolies and Chinamen and miscellaneous lepro-
sies, is the same reason why they should also be
handed over for a similar purpose. It is just
possible that, if the S.A. Government took
careful stock of the situation, it would find that
the western and north-western part of South
Australia proper—the place where the slow
“ mixed ” train runs to nowhere once a fort-
night over a mortgaged railway that hardly
pays working expenses—is a lot more unprofit-
able than the much-cursed Territory, and is
much more in need of being offered at a low
rate to any British land-grabber who will
accept it.
Municipal Reform.
Local Government, both in Sydney and Mel-
bourne, is a weird affair. Also, there is a great
deal too much of it. Within eight or ten miles
of Sydney Post Office there are 38 separate and
individual municipalities. Melbourne is simi-
larly split up into the “cities ” of Melbourne,
Collingwood, Fitzroy, Footscray, Hawthorn,
Prahran, Richmond, South Melbourne, and St.
Kilda, and the “ towns ” of Brighton, Bruns-
wick, Essendon, North Melbourne, Port Mel-
bourne, Williamstown, &c., &c. Altogether,
there are nine alleged cities, seven towns and
two boroughs in what may fairly be called
Melbourne. Each one of these multitudinous
subdivisions has its own mayor, and aldermen,
and council clerk, and auditors, and inspector
of nuisances, and pound keeper, and over seer of
works or engineer, and often its assistant
council clerk, arid otdrer officers as well. Eicli
one lias its own white elephant in the shape
of a town-hall, and generally its own particu-
lar row with the adjacent municipality.
In the outlying districts each one has its own
particular scheme for depositing the contents
of its night-cart in the next municipality.
When a new Governor arrives in Melbourne
18 distinct and separate grovels by as many
mayors and councils are liable to ensue at any
moment. When a new Governor arrives in
Sydney there are 38 separate municipal grovels
to be reckoned with. There are nearly 400
aldermen in the immediate vicinity of Sydney,
and a rather smaller number in Melbourne and
its vicinity. Almost every municipality has
its own separate debt, and as the whole pro-
vince generally finds it difficult to raise one
financial genius as Treasurer, it naturally
follows that Sydney and Melbourne have failed
lamentably in tlreir attempt to raise about 600
geniuses as aldermen, and tire monetary
arrangements of all these municipalities are a
fearsome and wonderful affair. Melbourne can
borrow money at 4 per cent., but the adjacent
towns and “cities,” as the price of their isolation,
pay from 5 to 6£ percent. The poor, straggling
municipalities around Sydney, as the result of
much furious discussion among the local
butchers and grocery men, have built up about
30 separate debts at rates extending as high as
8 percent. All these separate debts have got
to be separately renewed and separate com-
missions and renewal expenses paid when they
fall due, and the smaller municipalities, wiiose
credit is weak, often finance by going to see
one named Cohen or Isaacs in the same way as
the private individual who wants to pawn his
watch. The rnorai of the whole tiling is that
there is too much subdivision, too many
separate debts, and aldermen, and Town-halls,
and mayors, and all the rest of the parapher-
nalia. Tire short and simple device would be
to consolidate all Sydney and its adjacent
municipalities as far west as Parramatta under
one municipal body somewhat on the plan of
the London County Council, with sub-com-
mittees for different districts if necessary,
and to do the same with the nine cities
and seven towns ami two boroughs of
Melbourne and its environs. The saving
of labor, of needless officers, of salaries,
mayoral allowance, interest on municipal debts,
town-halls, overdrafts, newspaper reports of
council meetings and other things would pro-
bably amount to £50,001) per annum for each
city. Also, the saving in grovel would be
incalculable. The fact that a Governor of New
South Wales is liable to have 38 addresses read
to him by as many mayors in Sydney and its
suburbs alone is a truly awful thing to consider.
The Female Missionary.
A Maoriland paper records the departure of
some more girl-missionaries to'China, under the
heading “A new form of suicide.” “ A very old
form of murder” would be a lot more expressive.
According to latest advices the judicial inquiry
into the Ku-Oheng massacres is still proceed-
ing. A number of prisoners, after getting their
legs ami arms broken, and being hung up by
tire hair, and having tlreir joints smashed with
clubs, and receiving several hundred strokes
with bamboos, and being otherwise persuaded,
have confessed ami incriminated a lot of other
people, who have also confessed under very
similar conditions. A number of executions
have taken place, and a lot of mangled wretches,
broken and battered out of all human shape,
but still alive, are in prison awaiting
further revelations, ami putrefying among all
manner of horrors. Nobody knows whether
most of these persons are guilty or not ; tire
confession or the evidence of a man or woman
suspended by the hair, and with four broken
limbs, is not to be relied upon. Meanwhile,
the Australian girl-missionary is invited to
remember that she and her kind are the in-
direct cause of these horrors and similar ones
to come. She never makes any reliable con-
verts in the laud of the tea-plant and tire pig-
tail, so her going there does no good to any-
body. Sooner or later, if die stays there long
enough, some fanatic wipes her out and thereby
causes a lot of sympathetic drivel in the
religious papers. And then, in response to the
usual British demand for “ satisfaction,” there
is the usual gruesome butchery of many people
with no social influence to protect them, and
many of whom, probably, never saw her or
heard of her. Every infatuated girl-missionary
who goes to China under these conditions,
to get her photo, taken in native cos-
tume, and send it home to her admiring
but soft-headed relatives, and get gushing para-
graphs inserted about her in the snuffle papers,
and otherwise to feed her diseased vanity, is
preparing another tragedy of the same kind and
risking the lives of any number of innocent
people, and the fact that she insists on going
under such circumstances simply means that
she doesn’t care what happens so long as her
gushful soul gets its advertisement. How many
girl-missionaries would go to China if there
were no farewell tea-meetings, or admiring
speeches by the local parson and Sunday-school
teachers, or presentation of a crewel-work
monstrosity by the scholars, or paragraphs, or
weeping friends to see them off, or gush, or
halo, or other trimmings ? How many 1
The “ Lord" Mayor.
Queen Victoria, it is cabled, intends convert-
ing certain rather decent tradesmen into off-
color, second-hand, job-lot lords on her next
birthday. At that date Mayor Ives, of Sydney,
is, if he remains quite good in the interim,
to be allowed to call himself Lord Mayor
Ives, and to wear, presumably, another
row of fur on his cloak, and another inch of
pasteboard on his heels, and to elevate his
official nose at least 15deg. higher towards
the awestruck zenith. Nor will Lord
Ives stand alone in his felicity. To Lord
Bill Harris, and Lord 'Tom Jones, and
Lord Jack Smith, the dignity may in turn
descend and make life full of melody and glow.
And similar “ honors ’’ are apparently meant
to overtake later on the bootmakers, and grocery
men, and drapers and pork-butchers and fowl-
murderers who casually direct the civic
destinies of Adelaide, and Melbourne, and
Perth, and Hobart and Brisbane ! But it is
probably of no use protesting. In the shoddy
little souls of the shoddy little dignitaries to
whom the control of municipal affairs in every
country seems naturally to gravitate, the
hereditary savage instinct to be decorated with
a brass chain, and a big sash, and much mil-
linery, and to grimace and posture like the
baboon at the Zoo, is the single sentiment
which rises to the height of a passion. It cannot
be altered or eradicated. The street-sweeper
may guffaw, and the sanitary person may shriek,
at the antics of their official head, but that
head goes on his pompous way serenely.
Naturally Victoria fosters the instinct always
associated with the worms who crawl about the
feet of rnonarchs —which makes a donkey with
a red ribbon on his ti.il consider himself the
ne plus ultra of all possible donkeys.
And though Australia badly wants an im-
mediate remedy for the donkey instinct
there is nothing to Ire done but wait.
When the democrats do capture the munici-
palities—and it is high time they did ; and
when they find that they can stick to tlreir
alleged principles on the stage or off—most of
them, like ex-Republican G. Dibbs, can not ;
then Queen Victoria’s labels will be stowed
away as not wanted on the Australian voyage.
In the meantime, the performances of the vain
little folk who wear them are an interest-
ing sight under the magnifying-glass. And
everybody knows very well that of vital mean-
ing the tags and gauds of royalty worn in Aus-
tralia have about as much as the snap of a
finger.
More Aspects of the Dean Conspiracy.
The conviction of Meagher and Dean, and the
acquittal of the other accused in the famous
conspiracy case, opens up some more interest-
ing views as to the conduct of the N.S. W. Law
Department in that wholly remarkable trial.
The Law Department, which is practically
the Government, or at least a part of it,
arrested its political opponent, Crick, when
a summons would have found him equally
well. It made desperate efforts to induce
the magistrate to refuse bail, which is
granted as a right to almost every accused
person who can find the necessary securities.
It procured his committal by the lower court
on no visible evidence ; it prosecuted the case
to the very utmost, and it even implored Act-
ing-Judge Cohen not to accept the jury’s
verdict of acquittal tendered on Tuesday night.
Yet with all this it did not produce right up to
the end a shadow of direct evidence against
Crick, or a single witness who could connect
him with the alleged conspiracy. In the matter
of Mrs. Reynolds its conduct was almost
equally remarkable. That witness, before the
Royal Commission, identified Mrs. Dean as a
woman who came to her house under certain
disgraceful circumstances, and the Law Depart-
ment, in its enthusiastic efforts to mop up every-
body who was connected with that unpleasant
event, included her in the’ conspiracy charge.
Yet it did not bring forth one shred of real
evidence that she had conspired with anybody,
or had any personal interest in the ease, or that
sire had done anything save make a mistake in
a matter of identity. Considering that in New
South Wales, within the last few years, quite a
number of females have charged men with
capital offences, and then broken down and
acknowledged that the accusations were inven-
tions based on mere malignity and a gene-
ral desire to hang somebody or anybody,
and considering that none of these females
have been prosecuted, despite their admis-
sions of guilt, there is apparently only one
inference to be drawn. According to the
views of the law as it is in New South Wales it
seems to be no crime worth mentioning to
commit perjury with a view to sending an
innocent person to gaol or to the gallows, but
to conspire, or to make even a serious mistake
of identity that tends to snatch a guilty person
from the gallows and deprive the man-butcher
of his blood-offering is a dreadful sin, to be
pursued to the bitter end. Or, at least, if the
law doesn’t feel that way, it has contrived to
create a most unfortunate impression that it
does.
The Big War in Prospect.
The Venezuelan squabble may or may not lead
to war. The chances are it won’t. The Irish
faction in U.S. politics; the old grudge of the
New England States against Britain—fostered
by tire support given to the Southerners during
the Civil War ; the Democratic anxiety for a
good political cry to retrieve a losing cause
(and if a Republican cry, so much the better) ;
Uncle Sam’s national prejudice against mon-
archies, and his ingrained notion that the
Monroe creed enthrones him as arbiter of
all America’s destinies; —these are the chief
forces which make for war. But the Irish
faction, though prominent in politics, is not
paramount in national life; the “pure-merino”
Americans—Americans by birth and lineage—
already resent that faction’s domination, and
oppose it strongly, though in comparative
silence; and Southerners and Westerners,
though good citizens, do not hold so
vehemently the anti - English prejudice.
Yet the Democratic Cabinet presumably knows
what it is about, and must see that, once having
set its hand to the war-plough, it cannot turn
back without political ruin. Obviously,
situation is critical. And, though Britain may
demur to the U.S. claim to arbitrate, Britain
has none too strong a case. The frontier-claims
which she took from the Dutch along with her
Cuiana territory were weak enough in 1797,
and they are no better now. The British Govt,
is understood to recognise this, and to offer to
arbitrate provided Venezuela withdraws an
alleged absurd claim (based on a 16th century
Papal Bull) to about half the British territory
which the lively little republic declines to do_. _
It looks as if an anxious time was preparing for
Lord Salisbury. He has Turkey on his hands
as well ; and if the U.S. should come to blows,
it is almost certain that Russia and France will
seize the opportunity to leap at the lion’s
throat; and ttie big European scrimmage on the
carpet for the last 20 years will be fairly afoot.
Into that scrimmage Britain will come with
less to gain and more to lose than in any war
ol modern times, j his bout she will have to
set her back against the wall and light for her
life. Europe is heartily sick of her, and her
meddlesome cant and hypocrisy. She has
bullied the Continental Powers ever since she
beat the Aunada, and now her victims
yearn to take a turn out of her. India
is always simmering for another mutiny.
Turkey hates her, France hates her, Spain has
hated her for more than a century, over Gib-
raltar ; and Russia is determined, by hook or
crook, to get Constantinople. Almost cer-
tainly the Triple Alliance will stand aloof-
just as Britain would stand aloof if Russia and
France attacked it—and if the United States
has to be tackled at the same time, the kettle-
of-tish will be more than any Great Power ever
created could fry. And England is not the
Power she was. She has sold her soul to the
Manchester hucksters; her best blood has
emigrated ; her army is miserably small in
comparison with that of the big Continental
Powers ; Freetrade has cut the throats of
her yeomanry ; on her navy would fall
the brunt of the struggle, and the utmost
her navy could do in such an encounter would
be to defe id her home waters. Without some
provident al interposition, the result of the
next big war to Britain will certainly 1 e a oss
of power and prestige which no man can cal-
culate, if that war is f ught on the present
basis of European alliances ; and Britain blun-
ders coolly on with her old greedy policy,
wholly ignorant of the danger in which she
stands ! Meanwhile, Australia, without the
remotest concern in European quarrels, sits
down complacently exposed to the risks of the
British connection ! And how many these risks
are she will only begin to realise when the
trouble really comes.
The Canally poisoning-case, finally disposed of
last week in Sydney, is an example, in a small
way, of how the New South Wales law tosses
for the prisoner’s life with a double-headed
coin. Put in the shortest possible space the
story was as follows : One Brown put up for
the night at Canally station, and wandered
about the kitchen after the fashion of the usual
hungry swagman. Next day a pudding, which
had been made in the kitchen by the Chinese
cook, proved to contain arsenic, and Brown
was arrested on a charge of poisoning one of
the persons who ate it. No poison was
traced to him, and no one saw him inter-
fere with the pudding, but it was proved
clearly enough that he had every chance to
interfere if he wanted to, supposing he had
arsenic in his possession. He was tried and
acquitted, and then he was promptly committed
by Judge Wjndeyer to stand a second trial for
poisoning another member of the same family
on the same occasion with the same pudding.
At the time, it was rumored that the reason
of this second committal was a confession made
by Brown to a fellow-prisoner; but, as the
Minister for Justice emphatically denied the
existence of any such confession, this theory
fell through. Brown was tried a second time
on the same ineffectual evidence, and again
acquitted; but, as four persons ate of the
poisoned dish, it is obvious that, on this
policy, the law can try Brown twice more for
the same act, and thus get four separate chances
for a conviction ; in other words, it reserved
the right to get three new trials if Brown was
acquitted on the first, whereas if Brown was
convicted he could get no new trial at all. In
the same way, if Brown had been accused of
stealing a pair of pants with 22 buttons, the
law could try him 22 times by basing a separate
accusation of theft on each button, and then
try him again for the cloth part of the garment.
This is doubtless good enough law, but as jus-
tice it doesn’t seem to amount to much,
A truly remarkable statement by Crown-
Prosecutor Heydon in the Dean conspiracy
trial :
A tremendous handle had also been made of the fact
that the Crown had opposed bail in these conspiracy
charges. He would like to know whether Meagher in his
secret heart was glad or sorry that bail was granted. If
bail had been refused to Meagher they might, possibly
never have had that statutory declaration, because the
influences that were brought to bear upon him could not
then have been exercised. In considering the question of
bail, the Crown knew that they had to do with intelligent,
keen men of the world, and it was necessary that they
should be prevented from putting their heads together.
Sorbed out carefully the above foolish state-
ment pans out as follows : The prosecution did
its utmost to prevent the granting of bail, and
failed. If it hadn’t failed Meagher’s confes-
sion would probably never have been obtained,
and the course of justice might thereby have
been defeated. The prosecution took a most

unusual course which would probably have
defeated the ends of justice, therefore the
prosecution was to be commended instead
of being denounced for its utter mud-
headedness. It was “ necessary ” to take this
course to prevent the accused laying their
heads together, yet when they did lay their
heads together the result was that they supplied
the only piece of indubitable evidence against
Meagher which the Crown possessed. And
yet, though his only piece of absolute proof arose
through the defeat of the Crown’s supremely
stupid move, Prosecutor Heydon still says that
move was “ necessary ”—with his own case
staring him in the face, to show that it was the
one thing, above all others, which wasn’t neces-
sary. And, in any case, what kind of justice
is it which attempts to prevent the accused
“ putting their heads together ” to prepare
their defence while the Crown is allowed to put
its head together all it knows to prepate the
prosecution ? Heydon apparently assumes that
a person who is arrested is necessarily guilty,
therefore he can only want to put his head
together for purposes of perjury and to defeat
justice. This kind of logic takes no account of
the fact that an arrested person may be wholly
innocent, and has every possible right to put
his head together for the perfectly legitimate
purpose of proving his innocence.
Judge Chomley’s remark in a Melbourne court,
the other day, to the effect that the jury would
not regard a witness’s evidence as very valu-
able if he is a freethinker, is a reminder of how
far civilisation has yet to go before the true
relation of the citizen to his country’s laws is
adequately understood. Even countries which
stand in the van of Progress in all other
matters cling to this old conception of a dual
obligation, making it appear that unless the
law of the land is supplemented by an ecclesias-
tical law the citizen will forswear and perjure
himself without compunction. Switzerland,
forward in so much, is behind Victoria and the
rest of Australia in this respect. Each canton
enforces a restriction of some sort on the
professing freethinker. In the United
States, Arkansas and Maryland forbid a Free-
thinker to act as witness or juror. In Missis-
sippi and Texas anyone who denies the exist-
ence of God is ineligible for public office. In
North Carolina and Pennsylvania no one can
hold office in the Civil Service who does not
believe in future rewards and punishments, nor
can he act as a juror or give evidence in a court
of law. The charter of the United States is
the widest and wisest in the world, but having
left the several States free to restrict the
liberty of the individual in religious matters,
the issues are as described. Judge Chomley’s
remark in Melbourne is but a mild expression
of the perverse sentiment with which the citizen
even in the freest countries is harassed and
oppressed.
Parsons, as members of a trades-union where
competition is barred as far as possible by
church “ rings,” are strong supporters of com-
petition for other people. One of them, with
the unfortunate name of Stretch, recently
said in Melb. that God had set His seal on com-
petition. Still more recently another parson at
a brick company’s meeting congratulated the
directors on having separated from a local
combination to “ maintain” the price of bricks :
Parson Stewart considered that these rings or com-
binations and honorable understandings were essentially
immoral, because the avowed purpose was on one side
for the benefit of shareholders at the expense of somebody
else, namely, by making a profit that could not be made
in fair trade. •
A voice ; Oh, that is all nonsense.
Parson Stewart thought that honest men would see that
no number of men had a right to combine in that way to
make profits that could not be made in fair trade. He
was glad that the so-called honorable understanding had
been broken up.
Parson Stewart, in true clerical fashion, begs
the question that competition is necessarily
fair trade, and combinalion is necessarily un-
fair trade. Neither proposition is always true.
The combination that implies monopoly of a
commodity necessary to life may easily be a
public menace, but it cannot be worse than the
competition that leads to sweating. The trusts
in typewriters, bicycles, and tobacco may lead
to undue aggregation of wealth by the parties
to the trust, hut the direct evil is trivial to the
slavery entailed on men and women in the
sewing trades. Open competition, or “fair
trade,” which pits poverty against poverty
and wrings inordinate labor from the more
helpless, is damnable, though all the
parsons on earth bless it. The council
of churches down South had occasion some
time ago to deal with complaints against
the cheap matrimonial clergyman who adver-
tises'marriage ceremony, witnesses and ring for
ill; In this case the parsons felt a grievance
and duly registered a protest on the subject.
Nevertheless, an “honorable understanding”
Kill maintains marriage feei among the “ re-
spectable ” clergy at a high figure. Combina-
tion is often thievery, hut it pales its ineffectual
fire before competition, the eternal verity of
economic bosh.
Brassey’s Letter.
The following is Tub Bulletin’s advance copy of Gover-
nor Brassey’s second letter to Queen Victoria, re the
course of events in the Australian province which she
was named after. Brassey, as most people have heard, is
under orders to send Her Majesty a few lines occasionally.
His first letter was mainly an account of his gorgeous
reception in Melbourne. This second communication
was posted last week
May it please your Gracious Majesty, I write at
your command
To say how things are shaping in this rough, un-
polished land. |
Once more I have the honor to inform you, with
, delight,
That the local press is loyal, and the silken bonds
are tight;
When I breathe the name of England —and I
never miss a chance
To touch upon her greatness at a dinner or a
dance—
The effect is most impressive; all their honest
souls are stirred
By the merest little mention of that magic little
word.
And my Lady Brassey tells me that our leading
persons’ wives
Will be secretly unhappy till the Duke of York
arrives.
May it please your Gracious Majesty, much
virtue you will find
In a poem by Fitz Gibbon, which I send you,
underlined.
The verses are a tribute to myself, and wife, and
yacht:
They express the ardent feelings of the greatest
man we’ve got.
This colony has naught to fear from trait’rous
democrat
Whilst its honored public servants love the Gover-
nor like that.
Your Majesty, last week I gave a well-considered
fete
To some children from our schools, the schools
provided by the State.
Four thousand elder pupils, all their faces bright
and clean,
Were mustered up to hear me preach allegiance
to their Queen ;
I bade them love old England (’twas the cue for
“ lusty cheers ”)
And stand by Law and Order in the distant
future years.
I rounded off my good advice with lemonade and
tarts;
I hope they took the lesson to their tender little
hearts.
How sweet to hear The Anthem by those infant
voices sung ;
The Anthem’s words and music were intended for
the young.
I did not like the drawly “ twang ” apparent in
their tone —
But what’s a nasal accent to affection for the
Throne ?
May it please your Gracious Majesty, I crave of
you a boon
A statement that the Duke of York may bring his
Duchess soon
To give Fitz Gibbon and the rest the long-expected
thrill.
Their Highnesses, of course, won’t come ; but say
you think they will;
The papers would wax eloquent on such a charm-
ing theme,
And silken bonds would rise in, price—a royal
market scheme !
Your Majesty, I now approach one matter for
regret.
I find I cannot introduce the English Christmas
yet;
As a Governor from Home, I’ll strive to bring
these people round
To a loyal way of thinking we have snow upon the
ground.
I have spoken on the subject to some squatters,
who profess
To approve of my suggestion, and will pray for its
success.
There are many potent reasons why colonials
should not
Object to Christmas fires upon the ground that
they are hot,
Or despise the dear plum-pudding as a gastronomic
crime,
When its old associations are so Home-like and
sublime,
So rich in thoughts of holly-leaves and winter’s
silver rime.
I’ll bring the English Christmas here, with
Heaven’s help, in time.
May it please your Gracious Majesty, I kiss the
royal hand
And send a hearty blessing for my far-off Mother-
land ;
May the Monarchy fore’er defy each vulgar,
knavish trick—
Your faithful servant,
BRASSEY.
(English Governor of Yic.).
“Is your work mental ? ” “No, depart-
mental.”
When Gov. Brassey first came to Mel-
bourne he only tricycled. He has since learned to
bicycle, and may now be seen almost any day
pedalling his machine along St. Kilda road.
Gradually, however, the local snoboeracy are
making the cycling exercises of the Guvmentouse
people unendurable. They waylay the Brasseys
and their staff, try to strike up conversations with
them, dodge round them, pursue them, and try all
they know to attract vice-regal attention. The
Bulletin recommends H. E. to utilise his nautical
experience, and, when cycling, to wear a label on
himself, saying : “You are requested not to speak
to the man at the wheel.”

Sydney,
December 23, 1895.
Mr Dear Moorabinda—
Jingoism bad a bonny night out at Sydney Town
Hall, the other Monday, when Gov. Hampden
presented the retiring volunteer officers with
decorations commemorating the fact that they had
kept their powder dry and their girths pipeclayed
for a long period of peaceful Saturday afternoons.
By the way, it would be an interesting thing to
ask a veteran volunteer to give his medals a name,
wouldn’t it ? “ This one I got for invariably hav-
ing my boot-tabs tucked in on parade.” Gov.
Hampden also presented the Albert medal for-
warded by Albert’s Disconsolate Widow to Here-
ward Hewisbn, the Newcastle (N.S.W.) youth
who saved his brother from a shark last summer.
I thought it a cynically amusing circumstance
that the only accredited hero in the
whole glittering assemblage should have been
a plain civilian in evening - dress, who
possibly couldn’t “tell a chassepdt rifle from
a javelin,” as they say in “ Pirates.” But
the whole thing made up into a dazzling spectacle,
if there was very little history in it. The Town
Hall was superbly decorated with waving flags
and coats of arms, while the platform had tall
palm trees and exotic foliage to soften down the
military gaudiness of the scene. Also, the “ never-
never-never ” air was played with fervor by massed
bands and the big organ, and tfhere was an encore
verse added to the Anathema, and, taking it by
and large, the British Lion, the Flag, and other
old stock properties had another solid advertise-
ment, so to speak.
Gov. Hampden (part of his speech was “up
against ” the military, especially when he alluded
to there being “no dearth of officers,” and that
war in a peaceful country like this was “hardly
within the regions of possibility ”) wore a Court
costume which appeared to ha,ve descended upon
him from a very fat ancestor, and his man had
neglected to take a tuck in the weskit part, and
the way he carried his cocked hat with a line of
swansdown round the top made that official head-
gear look just like a fan. Lady Hampden wore
pearl-color brocade with violet sleeves and an
aigrette in her hair. Her Ex. carried a huge
white committee bouquet tied with the Hampden
colors, which didn’t harmonise with the rest of
her. The three daughters wore white chiffoney-
looking frocks, and they all carried bouquets, but
the most resplendent shape in the Y.R. group was
one of the aides-de-camp in hussar uniform, with
white breeches like Brownlow used to wear in
“ Nltouche, ” and a sort of lobster formation of
gold-plate over his swelling chest, hiding the front
of his scarlet coat. He was a moving mass of
pomps and vanities, and even Major-General
Hutton’s glittering criss-cross trimmings paled to
tinsel beside him. The decorating itself was a
simple business. Captain Dangar (who must have
suffered from clergyman’s sore-throat next day)
roared the names of the officers about to retire on
their geebung laurels in the voice of a first mate,
and Gov. Hampden pinned the medals on deftly,
and refrained from shaking hands with the sham-
fight heroes. The ’Ampdens do not seem to be
addicted to pawing everybody they come across.
It was the depth of military frill on the occasion
that made it such a brilliant pageant.
Officialdom in full war-paint crowded the plat-
form. Mrs. Edward Hutton (who will be greatly
missed in Sydney society) wore black, with hand-
some diamonds, and the only hat on the platform
was worn by the third Mrs. Parkes, who turned
up in walking-dress to what was distinctly an-
nounced as a full-dress affair. The galleries were
crowded with invited guests, and the southern
gallery seemed to hold more society people than
the other two. The best-dressed woman therein
was Mrs. Prendergast in silver and black, and not
too much black, and every second man wore some
sort of uniform or other.
The bitterest drop in the cup of deposed vice-
royalty of a certain province occurred at a recent
big sports gathering, when it came on to pour with
rain. All the stands were full, and two acting-
Governor’s daughters were moping out in
the wet, with nothing but an umbrella
to shelter ’em, and not a chance of getting
a seat. What a fall was there,' my country-
men ! compared with the time when they
would arch their necks and amble up the middle
with that unseeing stare peculiar to the Great, to
the amusing strains of the Anathema, into a nice
dry box ! If it hadn’t been for a thoughtful
elderly society Johnnie, who boldly went up to
the Governor, and acquainted him with the
forlorn condition of these lately-worshipped young
women, they would have been frozen out and
standing on one wet foot for the whole of the after-
noon. Since that experience the good-natured
Goy. always sends an anxious eye round the
horizon, on crush occasions, to see if any of these
abdicated damsels are throwing out signals of
distress.
I think the custom of always making the C. J.
of a province Acting-Governor is getting mono-
tonous. Variety is the spice of life, and it
wouldn’t be a bad idea if some of the other pro-,
fessions were given a few turns on top. As things
are, when the real Gov. goes away society is
mostly composed of lawyers—young unmarried
sharks with good prospects going literally on velvet
in a social sense, especially when His Acting-
Excellency has a quiverful of daughters to dispose
of. Budding barristers run about the premises
like tame cats, and their female relatives are a
sister, more or leas, to the acting-lady. Nobody
gets near the inner-circle unless there is a blue bag
in the family. Under existing circumstances the
best place to get diversified legal opinions in Aus-
tralia is at an Acting-Governoress’s garden-party.
It is also the best place to be careful what you
say. By the way, Lady Hampden’s maiden
garden-party took place on the 1 !-th inst. Lady
H. evidently means to cut the come-one-come-all
affairs, when the female populace besieges guvment-
ouse and no cards are necessary. Her first garden-
party was an invitation affair, whereas the
Governors’ wives gone before have invariably
opened the ball with a heterogeneous indiscrimin-
ate rolling-up of every female who had a best ’at
and a pair of gloves in her wardrobe, although
the invitation racket (which is quite comprehen-
sive enough, goodness knows !) set in afterwards
with all the usual severity.
Apropos of bridegrooms, when a girl marries
a young man who has led a frolicsome life, she
can’t be too careful about the manner in which the
gay Lothario approaches the matrimonial bird-
lime, and she should make sure the terms are
legal before she permits him to fold her to his
manly chest (all of which is beautifully s«t forth
in verse 2of one of Bradfield’s comic songs). And
apparently girls are waking up to the necessity
for a little caution in the conduct of their more
serious love affairs. For instance, I hear of a girl
who lately accepted a Johnnie whose “past ” was
somewhat lurid, so she was on the alert for any
equivocal sentences in the preliminary arrange-
ments. And thus, when Gussie began talking
things over, and suggested that he and she should
“go away somewhere on the quiet, my darling,
with no fuss or ceremony,” he found himself sud-
denly cut short: “No ceremony, indeed ! I shall
insist upon a ceremony ! ”
I wonder if anybody ever took the statistics of
engagements that never got as far as the altar ?
They would make interesting reading—some of
them, at all events —and the details might act as a
warning to young and inexperienced canoodlers as
to what mere straws will wreck the frail bark of
betrothal (female novelists are warned that this
elegant figure of speech is protected by a rabbit-
proof copyright) before it gets to port. I know of
one engagement which petered out because Romeo
wore a knitted necktie he could not satisfactorily
account for—having no female relatives; and
another lover came heavily to grass because he
wore white trousers to a picnic and inadvertently
sat in the salad dressing, with the result that he
looked from the back like an impressionist paint-
ing, and, consequently, ridiculous.
Which reminds me that an engaged Melbourne
youth who was sent to England for two years’ best
British polish, presented his fiancee with 104
envelopes all duly addressed to himself and
stamped, each envelope containing two sheets of
note paper dated for the departure of each succes-
sive mail ! Of course, that engagement was a
fizzle. Such a methodical man would never do as,
a lover—and now the lady has 104 sheets of note-
paper with stamped envelopes to match on haiid,
glaring reproachfully at her every time she opens
her writing-desk.
That was a shade worse—because more practical
—than the case of the infatuated youth who had
to tear himself away for forty days and forty
nights, or thereabouts, and who got a long slip of
perforated cardboard prepared, like a slab of forty
tram-tickets, and on each ticket he wrote “Kiss
me at eight p.m.,” which was Gussie’s litt’e habit
at that particular hour as a regular thing. And
the damsel had to tear off one ‘ ‘ Kiss me ” ticket per
night at that hour and give herself over to sweet
memories of how his moustache tickled—for forty
evenings until he turned up again ! But he let
her off easy—he might have insisted on her chew-
ing her tag.
Apropos love and marriage and all that sort of
thing, when any of the flock of a high church Mel-
bourne parson become affianced he always sends
them a little white and gold booklet inscribed
“The Brides and Bridegrooms” and containing
choice pickings from the Word re love affairs,
most of which (I mean the pickings, not the love
affairs) are of a pale cerulean hue. But one of his*
amorous quotations from the Song of Solomon
comes under the heading of the unprintable except

John Bull and Brother Jonathan .
Brother Jonathan’s liver is out of order, which,
considering the number of pill manufacturers and
quack medicine vendors he supports, is very
strange, and like all men with a touch of bile he
has been looking round for someone to row with,
and has picked upon his English cousin, John
Bull. We hope John Bull does not take his
impudence seriously, and would advise him to
send a box of B.L. Corto Rothschild cigars. They
will only cost Gd. each, and when Mr. Jonathan
smokes one he won’t talk fight, but will fall into
John Bull’s arms and bless him for sending such
a treat. B.L. Corto Rothschild’s are the best
Gd. smokes, and are obtainable at ail first-class
tobacconists.*

From H. J. Samuell I have received a copy of

songs and a waltz, and published at one slnlling.
“Dearest Di,” “A Farewell,” and “The Shy

enough to know ” is a comic duet that really is
funny. Violet’s improves upon itself in a popular
sense this year. From the same publisher comes
“ I was dreaming ’’—the Nellie Stewart version—a
much showier song than the Ada Crossley edition,
of which 35,000 copies have gone off nevertheless.
From Melbourne comes a very pretty “Serenade,”
words by Lindsay Gordon, music by Bernhard
Wendlet. The “Serenade ”is pretty and plain-
tive, and well worth studying in spite of a little
artificiality in style here and there.
Apropos of music, Sydney Liedertafel (whose
final concert of the year took place last Wednes-
day) committed its old-established serenade of the
Governor one evening recently, and was not
entranced with the experience, I am led to believe.
The crumpled rose-leaf was the chow-chow. After
the Liedertafelers had walked about the grounds
'or an hour and warbled themselves hoarse for
mother hour, they were, as usual, invited inside,
when claret-cup and buns miraculously sub-divided
were found to be the scope of the refreshments.
Music hath power to soothe the savage breast up
to a certain point only, it seems, and claret-cup
lies beyond it. The consequence was that there
ensued a great rush for the nearest hostelry after
the warblers got away from their patron’s weird
hospitality, and the next thing I expect to hear is
a cabal among them to sing horribly fiat the first
time they get His Ex. in the front row.
But you must give Gov. Hampden time to take
the bearings of the great Australian thirst. He is
a stranger yet and probably doesn’t know that the
Australian man prefers something that bites all
the way down like a dog-fight in his throat. And
when you come to think of the general appearance
of the average youth connected with a choral
society—sprucely collared and buttonholed and
carrying a little roll of music—it really doesn’t
seem very wonderful that underproof claret-cup
should occur to a strange host as the safest thing
to regale him on. One never associates snake-
juice with a man who begins in a treble voice
about “My Jane, my Jane, my pretty Ja-ha-
ha-ne” —a lady who probably never looked half as
shy as he does. 1
I had a short chat with Mdlle. Trebelli at her
hotel the other day, and thought people might
like to know that she wears an emerald with a
history on one of her fingers, and sings best on
champagne and oysters. Mdlle. is of the new
school, and sings equally well on “ biftek ” and
porter, and never starves herself out of mistaken
consideration for her top register, as so many
amateurs do. She is also delighted with Sydney
audiences, which she finds far more critical than
she anticipated (by the way, I notice that when an
audience is favorable it is always called critical),
and her opinion of music in Sydney is flattering.
Miss Edith O’King’s voice wins her special com-
mendation. Mdlle. T. does not evolve flawless
English in the course of conversation. For
instance, it is her pleasure to listen at singing, so
she says.
A large musical festivity, organised by the
United Arts Club, was held last Friday, m the
Town Hall, by way of doing honor to Captain
Poppy and the officers and crew of the
Aristides, for their heroic rescue of the crew of
the French barque Neuve Terre.. The platform
was decorated with the union jack and the tri-
color, and in the background was a colossal char-
coal sketch by Mr. Collingridge, showing a storm-
rent barque sinking against a background of inky
sky, and a boat toiling over a mountainous sea to
the rescue. Captain Poppy and his crew occupied
the middle distance, and tried to look thoroughly
at ease while Mayor Lees spoke to them at con-
siderable length about their heroism. Then Mons.
Wiegand accompanied on the organ while Mr.
Collingridge, in French uniform, with a sword in
one hand and the tri-color in the other, sang the
“ Marseillaise,” and Captain Poppy responded
with a better speech than the agitated hero gener-
ally gets off his chest at such functions, and the
rest of the concert passed off successfully.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
N.S.W. Attorney-General “Jack’’Want
has sailed for Japan on holiday, and a certain
Supreme Court Judge went down to the wharf to
see him off. Gratitude is a noble thing.
From the remarks made by Mr. Justice
Simpson in sentencing abortionist Sheridan to
death, it was generally inferred that his Honor
meant to report against the man’s execution.
Even now Sheridan’s case should be reconsidered,
as it is against the public will that any man should
be hanged who has committed only technical and
not deliberate murder with malice aforethought.
Dear Bulletin, —“ All Tas. hospitals are
wholly supported by the Govt.” Wrong. All
Tas. hospitals—bar Hobart—are more or less self-
supporting. Further, Hobart Hospital Board is
elective, and a recent proposal by the Govt, to
make it nominee was so strongly condemned that
Premier Braddon abandoned the idea. — Theta.
Ed. Bulletin,— l have myself shot platypi
at Herberton, and have met a Mr. Walcott, of
Tenterfield, who has two platypi shot or trapped
in the Norman River, Normanton, N.Q. While
Normanton is no further north than Herberton,
the above goes to show that the platypus is to be
found over a larger area than hitherto believed.

The disorganising hand of Xmas is upon
things at present and has reduced the show
department of this high-class family journal to
chaos. At the present season the alleged Chris-
tian over-eats himself in honor of his faith, and
the clammy plum-pudding lies like a great, moist
dish-cloth on his soul, and there are casual free-
fights all over the city, and the ordinary citizen
celebrates his redemption in beer, and the push
goes down to Manly and throws bottles and road-
metal all day long, and the tired ferry-skipper
and the ’bus-driver and the haggard ’bus-horse have
to work extra hours for the same pay, and “down
theharbor” isaplaceto be approached at the risk of
one’s life, and there is three times the usual quan-
tity of banana-peel on the pavement, and a kind
of blissful thingammy pervades the world in
general. Also, this is the time.when the man who
habitually beats his wife beats her rather harder
than usual, because he is more tight than he
generally is, and when the demented citizen winds
up with a festive butchery of his wife and family
and when it is practically impossible to wander in
a boat up the placid Lane, Cove River because the
water is full of naked footballers objurgating on
every sand-bar, and when -Cr.ok and Want howl
at each other more discordantly than usual,
and there is peace on earth and good - will
towards men generally. And the postal de-
partment celebrates the occasion by disorganising
the service as much as it can. Therefore,
The Bulletin has to go to press early with
a view to publication on Tuesday morning, and
most of what it has to say about the new pro-
grammes of Saturday night must be postponed
till next week’s issue.
* * *
On the 26th Brough and Boucicault, with
their splendid company, take possession of Sydney
Lyceum. “The Amazons ” will be played on
Thursday and Friday ; “Niobe ” on Saturday and
Monday ; Tuesday (December 31) and New Year’s
Night will be filled in with “ The Magistrate,” a
beautiful comedy which has been out of sight for
a long while; and “Dandy Dick ” follows for two
evenings. The co. has several new plays, among
them “The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith,” which will
be produced later on, and if the management has
followed The earnest advice and re-
papered the gallery where the hair-oil mark
of the local tough has lately been painfully con-
spicuous, everything should go well.
* * *K- *
Sydney Royal was to re-open on Saturday
night, as announced in the daily paper next to the
false-teeth advt.—and it probably did so unless
Providence intervened with an earthquake at the
last moment—under the management of C. B.
Westmacott with “Pat, or the Bells of Rathbeal,”
which is produced under arrangement with the
stupendous Monkhouse. The Bulletin’s kind
remarks about this production will appear in
next issue. The two music halls are progressing
as well as usual. Miss Alice Leamar has reap-
peared at the Tivoli, and the Ivanoff Brothers
and the Lenton Brothers, and the other miscel-
laneous brothers are keeping well. The Sydney
Music Hall has fixed up a stupendous Xmas pro-
gramme, and over 100 performers will be on the
stage at once, and it will seem as if 1000 Lieder-
tafels had broken loose. Also, Pollard’s juvenile
opera co. is booked to open at the Criterion
on December 26 with “ Olivette.”
** * *
Her Majesty’s wound up the dramatic
season with a successful burst of “ Robbery Under
Arms,” and the only Xmas pantomime in Sydney
starts at this house on Tuesday (December 24).
It is built on a scale of great magnificence, and
the shapely Marie Luella will exhibit sundry
gratifying limbs in the course of the proceedings.

Mark Twain returned to Sydney last week
for a two-night season, and lifted up his slow,
pensive voice in the shabby old hall of the School
of Arts. The said hall is musty as well as shabby,
and badly wants to be burnt down by some
judicious incendiary, and a new one built out of
the insurance money. The humorist on this occa-
sion broke loose from his old groove and gave
a rather newer ■set of reminiscences than
before, aqd he has a sinful “ pome ” on hand,
which is ■ probably the most remarkable thing
ever composed concerning this country. The
present brief season is announced as Twain’s very
last Australian appearance, which possibly means
that after his book is published it won’t be safe for
him to come back, and the public will have to
vent its fury on Smythe, who is stout and can’t
run away very fast, as a substitute.
** * *
The late G. A. Sala’s lecturing powers
were not overpraised by R. S. Smythe, the other
day. The fat man had good yarns to tell, and he
told them well, the one great business fault of his
first talk at Melb. Town Hall lying in its assump-
tion that the audience knew more about Euro-
pean things in general than he ought to have
given them credit for. A better fault than some
other new-chum lecturers have brought with
them. Sala didn’t start with the idea that he was
addressing “ a lot of dem’d colonials,” who know
nothing at all. He never placed himself in the
foreground of his pictures, and as regards his
battle experiences, he said : “In my time, a war-
correspondent wasn’t expected to distinguish him-
self ; we used to hear the cannons roar from a
respectful distance.” The best of his historical
sketches was the scene at Venice, when the Aus-
trian Governor took his departure and the city
celebrated its freedom from the foreign yoke.
Sala’s heart —and it was a big heart —went, into
that bit of descriptive work. He was half Italian
by birth.
** * *
Pounds can’t have any real personal griev-
ance against Melbourne audiences, for he was
always vigorously applauded when in good form.
When not in very good form, which was rather
often, he got less applause. The new-comer’s snorts
against “Australia’s” inability or neglect to appre-
ciate the opera chorus-singing seem excusable
enough. The choral numbers are splendidly sung,
in many cases, and go for much less than' their
artistic worth. But, after all, that is a matter for
the choristers to weep over,
*
Oourtice Pounds is a striking reminder of
Walter Howe, the large, round-headed actor who
made his first appearance with Bland Holt’s co.,
some years ago, as the Yorkshire farmer in ‘ ‘ Alone
in London.” Howe was strong in such character
parts, but when he came to play melodrama villains
and heroes his large head and small nose were
against him. Pounds is at the same disadvantage
in mere “singing lover” parts. He’s not suffi-
ciently like the beautiful young men depicted by
the Family Herald.
** * *
A Musical Festival, spiced with holy tab-
leaux of Bible stories, is to happen at Melb.
Princess’s on Christmas night. This is a new
departure in theatrical management, but the fact
that it hasn’t been usual to hold a Festival 24
hours previous to the Boxing Night production
need make no difference. Formerly the Exhibi-
tion was without opposition on Christmas night,
and its concerts became fat and lazy in conse-
quence. This year the public have a choice of
entertainment, and the rival advertisements are
excitedly lashing their tales.
** * *
“Djin-Djin” is the name of the Firm’s
coming spectacle at the Princess’s. As a spec-
tacle, “ Djin-Djin ” will be found fuller of sweet-
ness and electric-light than any other annual ever
seen on the same stage, it is said. Also the story,
described as a new and original pantomime, has
pretensions to humor. It deals with the awful
goings-on of a Japanese Bogie Man, and is rich in
lovely female characters, many of whom show
their legs to the greatest possible advantage,
and the gratifying Elton is in the cast. Lauri
has gone on tour in the comic opera business.
“Djin-Djin” promises to make amends for the
dreary pantomime of a year ago, which is saying
almost more than can be remarked with safety
before the event comes off.
* * *-
A pantomime has made arrangements to
break out at the Theatre Royal on Boxing night.
Hordes of children are engaged for George
Coppin’s show, but they will mostly vanish from
the scene before nine o’clock by Act of Parlia-
ment, on account of their tender years. A full-
grown company, headed by a new lady from
Great Britain, will take up the running after the
juveniles retire, and fight “ Jack and the Bean-
stalk ”to a finish. On second thoughts The Bul-
letin will not take oath that the Royal panto,
isn’t “ Jack the Giant Killer.” The point is
hardly worth pausing over. Probably the Giant,
the Beanstalk and Jack are all in it together.
Moreover, the title of the gorgeous item turns out
to be “ Santa Claus.”
*& * *
Adelaide theatres have been virtually
empty for three months past, and yet there is talk
of a syndicate building a third theatre. Two
variety co’s tried the sacred city recently and
failed, and in one case the members were stranded
for weeks. A moderate opera co. would coin
money in Adelaide just now. The halls will
actually be empty at Christmas time, when even a
GJ-year-old pantomime would bring profits.
At Poverty Point.
They used to say that Amy Roselle, on'the hoards, was
the image of Queen Victoria at her age.
Tapley haunted Melb. Princess’s whilst his successor
was playing, as though w’aiting for something to turn up.
The first time George Henry V. Rignold w’as seen on
the bicycle, whth his vast bulk protruding over the saddle
on each side, a bystander remarked: “Seems to me
there’s too much meat on the plate.”
Juliet Wray goes around Melbourne in a skirt of almost
comic-opera brevity-with her lead-pencil ankles and tiny
feet set in patent-leather shoes. When she trips up to
rehearsal in a frock that reaches only just below the curve
of her attenuated calf, and with her music under her arm,
Juliet looks like a simple little maid from school off to a
music lesson.
Elsie Cameron left W. and M. with a bounce because
she wasu t billed to play Katisha instead of Flo. Young—
although shi had a leading part in “La Belle Therfjse,”
with dresses of the most gorgeous description. The shrill
and angular Juliet Flegeltaub took the plump Elsie’s
place in the French operetta.
Miss Maud FitzStubbs, gf “Heather” and “Orlando”
waltz fame, is just 34. Her first’public appearance was
as a juvenile prodigy pianist at the old Sydney Academy
of Music. That was in IS6/, when she was 6 years old.
Flo. Wilton, leading boy in Melb. Royal Panto., tells a
bailiff yarn : She was acting with a co. at Greenock, when
tne men of law came and looked up all the dressing-
rooms, and at the end of the performance refused to let
the performers get into their everyday garments. So the
whole troup had to march through the streets of the
unco guid Scotch town in tights and other states of stage
undress.
When in Australia, Bradfield said he had only seen
Roberts three times, and Leslie not at all. This in reply
to assertions that he imitated those two burlesquers.
And now Flo. Wilton is reported as telling an interviewer
that Bradfield was understudy to both Roberts and
Leslie, and was considered a very good imitation of
both ! How Braddy understudied and yet seldom or
never saw his principals is left to be explained. It cer-
tainly is not often tiiat an understudy escapes rehearsals,
&c., so easily.
The 16th January, 1896, will be the centenary of the
opening of the first Sydney theatre. It was erected at a
cost of £lO9. The gallery was the fashionable part of the
house, and the price of admission there was Is. worth of
rum, tobacco, flour, or other commercial commodity.
But eventually this system of charging “ brought down
the house,” for the. theatre became so popular that con-
victs committed all kinds of thefts and frauds to obtain
the means of admission. One genius killed an officer’s
greyhound and palmed it off on the “ticket-taker” as
kangaroo-meat. Finally, the Governor ordered the place
to be pulled down. ‘
At Turin (Italy) the most realistic play of the year,
entitled “The Corpse of the River Po,” was doing good
business when the mail left. In the first act, a supposed
corpse is diagged from a tank representing the river. The
second act plays in the morgue, six bodies on slabs
furnishing the realistic decoration to the place; but the
climax occurs in the fifth act, where the hearse, upon
which 12 coffins are being conveyed to the Potte.’u Field,
is drawn over the scene and upsets in sight of the public,
the coffins tumbling over. One of them, containing the
murdered body of a woman, opens, and the dead victim
rolls at the feet of the heavy villain, her murderer.
“ Gee money ” is the cant term for cash bestowed on
boys who band together in the gallery to applaud any
artist who cares to hire a popular demonstration at the
price. Coleman was “ bailed ”-up the other evening, at
the stage-door of Melb. Opera House, and asked for “ Gee
money.” “Gee money?” queried Coleman. “What do
you mean?” “Money to applaud yer, sir,” roared the
blackmailers. Their intended victim declined the propo-
sition. “ Very well, then,” said the chief tax-collector,
“we’ll ‘ break you up ’ when you come on the stage to-
night ; you see, now.” That night, Coleman was inter-
rupted several times by a mysterious mumbling noise in
the gallery, which worried the main body of the “ gous
and led to a considerable tumult. Coleman stopped, and
peace reigned for a time. Presently, the mumbling broke
out anew, and the performer, after his “ turn,” walked on
disgusted. Nearly every night thereafter Coleman had
to submit to some interruption from the “ Gee-money-
contingent.
The jubilee of Melbourne pantomime is at hand. On
Feb. 21st, 1846, the first “ grand comic pantomime ” was
produced in that city by George Coppin, who appeared
with the famous Rogers in an afterpiece. Support must
have been shaky, for the critic said, “ Such wretched
sticks as Mr. A’Beckett Evans, whom we never saw before,
mars the efforts of good actors.”- Grammar and coher-
ency were matters of very little importance in Melbourne
50 years ago.
Melbournian : “ When is ‘Trilby,’ the foot-plate of the
drama, to find her way to Australia ? Surely we are
behindhand. Our best forces are allied to the nubbly foot.”
Successful new London plays, not yet seen in Australia :
“ Trilby,” “ PaSsport,” “ Mrs. Ebbsmith,” “ Benefit of
the Doubt,” “Artist’s Model,” “King Arthur,” “Home
Secretary,” “ His Excellency,” &c.
Cecil Ward is said to have an idea of starting as a
broker on Adelaide Stock Exchange.
Miss Janet Achurch has been playing in the “ New
Magdalen ” round London recently. She got more support
than usually falls to the share of the gifted Achurch, but
then the Charrington brewery is still prosperous.
The “ Blind Jubilee Singers ” were met on arrival
ai Maryborough, Q., by a letter from the local
church people asking them to sing at next Sunday’s
service and swell the offertory. This their agent agreed
that they should do. After remaining three days in the
town, without receiving the slightest courtesy, or even a
call, from the pastor or members of the church, the
“ Singers’” eyes were opened to the obvious fact that they
were being “ made a convenience of.” So they wrote that
20 per cent, of the offertory must be handed them to give
to the Hospital, and received from the clergyman at the
head of affairs this Christian reply: “ Inform your
manager that we will not give him the 20 per cent., and
the co. can stay away. Why should we run abo*t after
you ?” The church is quite prepared to sweat travelling
professionals, but its religion rarely prompts it to make
any return.
Dick Seddon and his henchman, Carroll (Maori Minis"
ter), have been having a good time at Pipiriki, on the
Wanganui River. They had an al fresco concert, at
which the Premier sang “ Yillikins and his Dinah,” sup-
ported by the whole strength of the company. “Me and
the boss can flop down in any company,” says Carroll.
“ If there is singing we can make a noise, and if it is cards
we can take a hand.”
Elsie Hall has covered herself with glory at Leipsic>
where she won the Mendelssohn scholarship, beating all"
comers, German, French and others. She is looked upon
as a specially-gifted girl, and is one of the few Australians
who have really made their mark in Germany, though
many have come home to Australia with a flourish of
trumpets, and certificates from various professors of
small consequence in their own country.
Clement Scott says his eternal feud with Mrs. Kendal
started this way. Years ago, he went behind the scenes
of a provincial theatre, and blundered right into Mrs.
Kendal’s dressing-room. “Go away ! ” shrieked the lady,
cowering in the midst of her dishevelled charms.
“Madame,” said Clement, gracefully, “I need no per-
suasion.” And Mrs. K. has never spoken to him since.
Anyhow, that’s Scott’s yarn.
A book that remains to be written : “ The Woman Who
Wanted To.”
Rignold makes a point of never inviting vice-regal pat
ronage. If the Governor likes to come he can ; if he
doesn’t, he needn’t.
The story goes that when The Bulletin’s lengthy friend,
Kathleen Lucille Foote, was in Melbourne with Lonnen’s
Gaiety crowd, she became engaged to the son of a Vic.
Supreme Court Judge. But the youth funked explain-
ing things to his father, so the lady took on the job her-
self, with the result that the agreeably-astonished little
potentate shook her hand warmly and said the two of
them could fire away. But, somehow, they didn’t “fire
away.”
Johnny Wallace lifted up his voice and swore the other
evening, after rehearsing the Princess’s extravaganza.
Some mean thief had walked off with his silver-mounted
Malacca stick, a present to Johnny from Nellie Stewart
in days of yore.
According to Bernard Shaw, Pinero’s new play, “ The
Benefit of the Doubt,” is worth “The Profligate,” “Mrs.
Tanqueray,” and “ Mrs. Ebbsmith ” rolled into one.
Just 20 years ago on the 29th December the ill-
fated lima' di Murska married Alfred Anderson at
Sydney. Anderson died in Melbourne just three months
afterwards. And barely two months later the widow
married J. T. Hill in Maoriland.
The London Jeames who prattles of dukes and duchesses
for Melb. Argus has dreamt, or been told, that “the
Americans discovered ‘ Pinafore ’ after it had been first
produced with no very marvellous results in London.”
As a matter of fact, “ Pinafore ” was the talk of its native
city from the first night of the production. Its jokes
went around like wildfire, and its march was seized upon
by every brass band. “ Pinafore ” didn’t take London by
surprise, for even “ The Sorcerer ” had been written up as a
revelation in comic opera a few months earlier, and the
critics were waiting for the next Gilbert and Sulli van
work when it came. The Andris Jeames has a talent for
talking astounding nonsense in a well-informed tone of
voice which imposes upon his victims.
The theatrical ladies’ tail-hat nuisance has become
practically extinct at Dunedin (M.L.) since the female
franchise came in. The burden of the new’ responsibility
has practically squashed the big hat flat.
Photos, of Paganini, as he appeared in September last,
were about to be placed on the Paris market when the
mail left. The fiddler’s grave was opened for repairs, and
his family found him in such first-class preservation that
they decided to snap-shot their deceased relative from
half-a-dozen points of view. Poor old Paggy is a corpse
of 45 years’ experience, so he had never been photographed
before.
Miss Dorothea Baird, now playing Trilby in London
under Mr. Beerbohm Tree, is sister to Mrs. B. R. Wise and
Mrs. Threlfall, of Sydney. She is said to be a charming
actress of great physical attractions. She is also a cyclist,
hockey player, and cricketer.
It is a common saying that there are only six successful
subjects in Pantomime.
The superstition of sailors was demonstrated to Harry
Nicholls, of Adelphi fame, one time on the P. & O. boat
Bengal, when, upon being asked to oblige on the har-
monium, he droned out the hymn “ For those in peril on
the Sea.” “ Garn ! stow it,” came a gruff voice from on
deck. “We weren’t in no blanky peril till you started.
That there tommyrot ’ull sink the ship.” Nicholls
“ stowed it” right away.

When the jury insisted on acquitting
ttflck on Tuesday _ afternoon, Crown-Prosecutor
Heydon opposed vigorously, and even demanded
that the Judge should not accept the verdict until
the case was formally completed. If he had suc-
ceeded, Crick would probably not have been
turned loose till Eriday, and then he would have
bowled up to Parliament House to find the proro-
gation just going on, and no chance of making any
disparaging remarks about Attorney - General
Want or the Government generally for the next
five months, and the big demonstration which
greeted him would have missed fire, and he would
have probably gone away and burst in a corner all
by himself with the pressure of his bottled-up
feelings. Even as it is, he will probably burst
through pent-up emotion within the next few
months. He must have a whole Webster’s
Dictionary still to say, and the retreat of
.'Salomons to Europe and of Want to Japan
makes it impossible for 'him to get his re-
marks off his chest personally, and he can’t
cable them at the present extortionate rates.
The spectacle of Crick toiling over the defence of
the local h©rse-thief through the sultry, scorching
summer, with his tongue hanging out on to the
documents, and knowing that his enemy is bask-
mg in a cool land of brown women, and that by
the time he comes back all the public interest will
have evaporated, is a thing to arouse sympathy
and a big public subscription to keen him in cool
drinks.

The one man who seemed in the latter
days of the trial to have lost all semblance of
HIS FIRST DRUNK.
PARSON (to teetotal member of his congregation) : “Dear me I are you
drinking again?”
TEETOTAL MEMBER: “No, mishter , no—only gish beginning!”
interest in the Dean case was Doan. That fallen-
master-mariner slouched torpidly in the dock and
took little notice of anything. He didn’t seem
unhappy, or agitated, or inclined to pine away;
he simply wore the aspect of a man who had hung
up his brain on a nail in the wall, and was bask
ing. A man of more intellect might naturally
have looked worried ; Dean assumed the rsle of a
man who had given up pretending to have an
intellect, and who was getting on a great deal
hitter without it. Ho had the stolid air of the
Chinaman who can sleep balanced on his stomach
on a spike, and who takes all things philosophic-
ally. Probably Dean acquired an aspect of more
or less intelligence in past days through the neces-
sity of not colliding with the wharf, and now that
that mental exercise is gone he is gone, too.

The N.S.W. Crown Law authorities, who

conspiracy case. That witness was the injured
Mrs. Butler, who was penniless and prostrated,
but yet managed to get down to the court to sup-
port the “ Crown’s ” case, and thereby convict it
of a gross miscarriage of justice in the original
trial.

Judge Paul, of Queensland, is probably the
most festive and least starchy of Australian

even more festive than he is now. Once, years

broke up in a glorious state of champagne, and
with its hat askew and cigar-ash on its shirt-front,
in the small hours of the morning. Paul, who
was sober, carried one inebriated local potentate
to his door-step, and then went to his own home
down the street. He was just getting into bed
when the potentate’s flunkey arrived and insisted
on him coming back. Mr. was in a fearful
state of excitement and must see him about some-
thing at once. Paul went back accordingly, and
found the potentate collapsed and weeping drinky
tears on the pavement. “ Paul, ole f’ler,” he said
in tones of great emotion, “I couldn’t shleep
without asking if you ever got any answer to that
epishtle you wrote to those blesshed Ephesians.”

An Otago publican, who had been “ having
a few words with his missus,” was sent for and
severely lectured by a member of the local
Licensing Committee. The publican has much to
put up with now in the land of cold snuffle and
water.
Clergymen of all
Protestant sects ride
hard, and don’t feed
their horses too well;
likewise they are very
rough on borrowed
horses. P.ut the horse
of the R.C. priest is
always carefully kept
in good condition.
“Rolf Boldrewood ”
finds the explanation in
celibacy, which gives
the bachelor priest the
same love for his horse
as the elderly spinster
has for her cat. The
Chinaman in Australia
is also usually a bache-
lor —and see how fat
“ hossee ” always is.

Dear Bulletin, —
Is a ram a sheep ? And,
if so, what becomes of
“Banjo’s” assertion
that a sheep never at-
tacked anybody with-
out provocation ? One
case. Pet-lamb at a
Footscray boiling-down
works, having attained
to ram’s estate, takes
to butting employes
about. Employes com-
plain, employer jeers
them about being
“ afraid of a poor
dashed sheep,’’and next
day the p.d.s. charges
him unexpectedly in
the rear, badly dam-
ages his spine, and
leaves him a cripple
for life.— Bump.

Now that Gov,
Brassey has displayed
an inclination to wan-
der around after the
manner of Haroun Al-
raschid and visit all
sorts of places unex-
pectedly, everybody is
impressed with the Idea
that he may be the next
to be favored with a
call. At tea-fights,
pleasant Sunday after-
noons, and kindred bun-
struggle functions, fur-
tive glances are per-
petually east towards
the door as though H.E.
might be expected to
drop in at any moment. The result is that the
local Sunday-school teacher is acquiring the
strained, anxious expression of a man who is
about to buy a bicycle, and looks as if he had a
crime weighing on his soul.

In order Chat? the surgeon and commander
might examine a 14-year-old candidate for a cadet-
ship in the navy, H.M.S. Karrakatta steamed
recently from Port Phillip to Launceston (Tas.).
The boy proved to have two teeth that were not
quite up to the junk-and-biseuit standard, and
so the application was rejected. Then, after a few
days’ rest, the cruiser departed with all due pomp
and ceremony. The cost of the coal consumed on

false-teeth, besides several other things. 13ut they

Amongst the bitterest opponents of Vic.
P.M.G. Duffy’s post-card beer and tobacco advts.
was a suburban Anglican parson who declared
that “tobacco and beer were the ruin of young
Australia,- and »on. This cleric’, ohureh reL.tlf
promoted a concert, and m order to defray the
°°f® printing the programme advts. were
,sollcito l d trom the district tradesmen. The only
ones w “0 responded were the local publican and
tobacconist, and their notices setting forth the
virtues of Blank’s brandy and Dash’s tobaccoi
together with a few words in favor of the billiard-
table at the pub., duly appeared. The local paper
got aggravated because the printing was done at
the office of its reptile contemporary, and is now
engaged giving the parson “particular beans.”
At Ballarat (Vic.) a man aged 21 has been
gaoled for nine months for eloping with his step-
daughter, aged 17. The poor, misguided wretch
married a widow aged about 40. Then there is a
gap in his history which anybody can fill in. The
widow of 40 grew older on closer inspection. He
began to see her with her curl-papers in, and no
lady of that age can bear being inspected in her
curl-papers. He also began to see her with her
old frock on, and possibly three buttons open
down the back and a piece of flannel (flannel,
the deadly foe of Love !) sticking out, and
hyhig around to get the breakfast in shoes
that were trodden down at the heels. Many a
widow of 40 looks nice enough for anybody to
marry with her best frock on and her hair done,
and yet seems a dishevelled fury when she has a
coal-smudge on her face and is lighting the fire on
a cold morning. And meanwhile a really nice
girl of 17 only looks like a picturesque Cinderella
under the same conditions. So the Ballarat man
did what anybody else would have done in like
circumstances, and a Judge, who had probably
never seen a woman 20 years older than himself
carrying in coals with her curl-papers in, refused
to enter into his feelings.

The councillors of a certain S.A. municipal
corporation have been at loggerheads of late. The
trouble commenced owing to a councillor accusing
a colleague of living with a lady to whom he
wasn’t married, whereupon the latter replied that
he had never abducted the wife of a Chinaman,
anyhow. This delicate suggestion led to a row,
and the two councillors, accompanied by the
Mayor, who attempted to act as peacemaker, felj
down two flights of stairs and would have Jeis :
oendacl a third had they not been stopped by the
town clerk, who happened to be coming up. Tha
most damaged man is the town clerk, and whea

married to 17 aboriginal women, or something.

1 he booming of the surge is a solemn, slow death-
dirge,
The seabirds wheeling overhead are wailing as
they fly,
The beetling cliffs are weeping, with the spray
upon them leaping,
For things long dead, and things just dead, and
things that are to die.
What sadness in the deep when the long green
rollers sweep,
Sweep shoreward with the burden of their cease-
less monotone.
God ! the irony of bringing her, with garments
wet and clinging,
Straight to my feet that lagged for her upon the
sands alone.
“ Dear, say you are not dead—no, never dead, not
dead/
Do move your little tight-clenched hands—so
quick they used to be !
Just a tremor, just a quiver! Oh, come back
across the river,
And smile at death ; and laugh at death. Come
back, and speak to me.”
Can water upward flow—can the river backward
go?
Can the sun retrace his course from West to
East at close of day ?
Is there any use in crying to the still form past
replying ?
Will words bring back to life the lifeless, soul-
less, cold white clay ?

Five hundred ! how did he assess it,
The value of conjugal bliss ?
Did he simply baki-headedly guess it,
Or sum up each fondle and kiss ?
Were the buttons sewn on plaintiff’s breeches
With a more unreliable thread ?
Was she careless concerning the stitches
In the crazy-quilt-work on his bed ?
Did she gaze with a glance that was colder
On the tea-pot of fast cooling tea ?
Or her look at the steak was it bolder,
Less tender than what it should be ?
And how was that Love we call golden
Assessed by common-law sense—
’Twas priceless they said in days olden,
Not measured by shillings and pence.
Five hundred ! how did he assess it.
The value of conjugal bliss ?
Did he simply bald-headedly guess it.
Or sum up each fondle and kiss ?
Perhaps we are sillies and stupids
To look upon Love as a god,
But it’s sacrilege, surely, when Cupid’s
Reduced to mere damage “per quod.”

through liis own heart. And now he lies for inquest, the

and his awful, ungovernable temper.

The St. Kilda (Melb.) councillors didn’t
get right through with their Brassey grovel until
fast week. St. Hilda’s formal address of welcome
to the new Gov. was so specially gorgeous that
Providence wouldn’t permit it to be presented
along with a mob of other and inferior addresses
on a certain day. So it got lost for a while. St.
Kilda had received Brassey at the landing-pier on
his arrival, and bombarded him with civic con-
gratulations, so the favored borough could afford
to stand aside whilst this formal address was mis-
laid. In due course the document came to light,
and last week a band of St. Kilda councillors pre-
sented it in a private and confidential style. Lord
Brassey being at the Government offices, they
swooped down upon Premier Turner (by appoint-
ment) and got him to conduct them into the vice-
regal presence. Brassey wasn’t quite as warm as
they could have wished. His manner suggested
an opinion that a lost civic address is the last
thing in the world that ought to be ever found
again.

there was an English lord among the passengers
to whose wants the amazon was attending with a
large jug of sauce for the plum-pudding (the only
form of entremets at Bumbenu). She looked at
him from the opposite side of the table and
inquired, “ Juice, sonny ? ” His lordship did not
at first understand, and looked uncertain whether
it could be possible for him to bo thus addressed ;
but when she waved the jug towards him and
said, “ You, I mean—juice ? Gravy ?” a scarcely
perceptible smile oozed from his phlegmatic coun-
tenance as he said, “ Haw, I thank you,”

A Sydney pawnbroker in the neighbor-
hood of the old Central Police-court asserts that
his business was ruined when the court was
shifted. In Liverpool-street, between George and
Pitt Streets—the immediate vicinity of the Central
Police-court there are now firmly established
nearly a dozen “dealers,” half of whom hold
pawnbroker’s licences, all doing well. Monday is
a big business day, as Saturday and Sunday
drunks and disorderlies are put through the mill,
and there is an active rush of fines. Then the
best girl pawns her brooch or rings or teeth
to pay the fine for her “chap,” or the “chap”
in the same way pledges his belongings to secure
liberty for his “donah.” The police-courts, the
pawnbrokers and the pubs are a lovely trinity.
A young Wellington (M.L.) servant-girl
recently repeated the old story, and the baby was
found in her box. Whereupon Labor-Secretary
Tregear used this pithy language :
We pass laws which compel such girls to attend school,
and. then we cram them with stuff about “ the population
of Berlin,” and “the longest river in Asia,” and “the
exact age of Methuselah’s goat,” and other valuable items.
Not a word as to their functions as mothers and wives, or
as to their duties as married women, a duty which the
majority of them will have to fill. We take our girl
children, let them grow up among the temptations of
the passions and the poison-flowers of a corrupted civilisa-
tion, and to guard them against weakness we teach them
about the population of Berlin. Damn the population of
Berlin !
The Bulletin is sorry for the population of
Berlin, but it is compelled to damn ditto.

The youth of 17 who married a spinster
of 21, in Sydney, the other day, has thereby
brought the parson who performed the ceremony,
and others who assisted at it, before the bar of
public opinion as participators in a breach of law.
But many a youth of 17 looks 21, and when such a
person says he is of age the celebrant is certainly
above censure. Where military recruiting systems
are in vogue the question of age is often raised.
Individuals in their teens frequently enlist as
of full age, and friends sometimes endeavor to
make the enlistment null; but the authorities (the
British War Office authorities in particular) have
fixed rules to the effect that » person who states he
is a certain age, and who looks it, is that age for
all military purposes.

Melb. has got the Brassey-Sunbeam boom
bad. Every toy-boat is a Sunbeam, while callow
shop-walkers spend their time and stamps in
arranging “Sunbeam ” picnics. The latest grovel,
however, is the Sunbeam Sticky Fly-paper, a sheet
of paper covered with a gummy substance from
which the fly cannot detach himself when he has
once settled. The directions are : “ Gently pull
the two edges apart until wide open ; it is then
ready for use.” Just liken the fly-paper to a
verbose Governor, and the simple fly to the
general public, and you have a parable ready for
use. All you have to do is to gently pull the
Governor apart until be is wide open, and the thing
is done.

Governor Brassey offered to hand a
cheque for over =£looo to the Victorian artists to
clear off the debt on their rooms. The men of the
easel, however, respectfully declined the offer,
preferring to clear off their debts by their own
efforts. Apparently the Vic. artists are the only
people in Melbourne who have not got the grovel-
complaint in its very worst form at present.
The Sydney Presbyterian, in its issue ot
2nd November, comes out as an advocate of can-
nibalism :
God said to Noah, as the second father ot human-kind :
« Every moving’ thing’ that liveth shall be meat for you ,
even as the green herb have I given you all things. This
privilege was woven into the religious system of the
Hebrews, who were permitted to eat of the sacrifices from
the altar, and required to feast on the paschal lamb till
nothing remained save the bones. On religious grounds,
therefore, the most uncompromising vegetarian neeu
have no conscientious scruple in eating human flesh.

When the

that its inhabi-
tants can’t even
begin to un-
derstand the
unutterable old
age of China
and its con-
tents, or the
unutterable
patience with
which the Chow
preserves his
belongings. He
lives in an at-
mosphere of
great vener-
ableness, and
his bed some-
times goes back
to the days of
the siege of
’Derry. The
Chow is the
epitome of old
unchangeable-
ness. When he
turns in and
gets into a par-
ticular hollow of
his mattress he
often gets there
because his
great grand-
father made the
hollow and died
in it.

The 26fli annual report of the National Mutual
Life Society show* that, lor the year ended 30th Septem-
ber, 1805, the total funds have increased by £95,197, and
now amount to £1,560,223. The increase in ’94 was a
little over £91,000, and in ’93 about £113,000, so things
are somewhat better than they were last year. The
net premium income is £206,210, against £208,000 last
in ’93. The death claims (£58,343) are
«IoV?,o ess . last y ear - The expenses amount to
“62,013, a reduction of £lBOO as compared with 1894 ; but
still this item is remarkably heavy, and equals a shade
over 2o per cent, of the premium income, or nearly 19 per
cent, of the total income from all sources. The tremend-
ous competition in a country where there are far too
many insurance societies in proportion to population, and
consequently too many big offices to keep up, and too
many managers, boards, actuaries, office-staffs, &c., &c ,
to pay, and where heavy commissions must be paid
to enable agents to live because there are more
agents than the business can properly support,
are the main causes of the high-expense rates in
Australia, and these high expense rates are cruelly hard
9P ... ®, comm on or garden variety of insurer. The
National Mutual is not the worst sinner in this respect,
and it is a victim of circumstances like the rest, but still
its 25 per cent, upon premiums is a solemn thing for
eveiybody interested.
. The interest received on investments (=671,318)
is a respectable figure, though it is £l7OO less than the
amount realised last year, when the funds were £99,000
less. But several other items in the balance-sheet would
be better if more information was given. “ Accrued
interest ” appears regularly, but there is no mention of
interest in arrears, therefore it would seem that either
there are no arrears, which seems almost impossible, or
that they are included in the “ accrued,” which seems too
small to hold anything except itself, or else they are
lumped in with the investments. If the latter is the case,
then there is no means of guessing at their amount, and
thus forniing an idea of the condition of the investments,
which is the most important consideration as regards
the policy-holders. The practice of not disclosing the
amount of interest _in arrears is about the most
nefarious that an insurance - society can fall into,
and the National Mutual would do well to make its
balance-sheet more explicit in this respect. There is an
ever-increasing item under the head of Victorian “ build-
ing societies shares ” - it stood at £31,000 in 1888 when it
purported to be loans on the said shares, and it now
reaches nearly £69,000. Also the shares appear to be now
the National Mutuals own property. Considering the
state of many Victorian building-societies, the docu-
ment _ should state what societies this considerable
sum is invested with. Freehold property doesn’t seem,
so far as the balance-sheet shows, to have been written
down lately, despite the awful slump of the last three
years, and it would be interesting to know when the last
valuation was made. There are £160,000 on deposit, and
the policy-holders certainly ought to know where this
large amount is located. Many fixed deposits are in
rather a ted way just now, and it would save some
anxiety if it was shown that the aforesaid £160,000 is in a
perfectly safe institution.
A^r^ in amount of interest attaches also to
the £45,000 or so which is represented by “ deferred
instalments of annual premiums on policies in force.” The
insurer may pay either quarterly or half-yearly. If his
policy dates from, say, the Ist July, there will almost
always be nine months or six months premiums remaining
11 U P hls 1 pavinent when the books close
on JOth September, and the National Mutual apparently
follows the practice of setting these amounts down as aii
asset. As the assured is under no obligation to
pay these amounts they are hardly assets in anv
reasonable sense, and yet they represent nearly 3 per
cent, of the society’s funds. Money that the society has
never received, and may never receive is, to say the least
a debatable item in a balance-sheet. The reserve against
, d i e P re c latlon l ot securities stands at the same figure
(£35,000) as last year, and, considering the circumstances
this amount looks wholly inadequate. The National
Mutual has only £14,000 in State and municipal securities
and most other investments are liable to a good deal of
depreciation in bad times. Also, it owes £8862 as
deposits and accrued interest thereon,” and it is diffi-
cult to understand why a life assurance society should
receive money on deposit at interest, or how it gets it
at low enough interest to make the transaction pay.
Altogether the National Mutual’s sheet suggests quite a
number of questions about matters which may be per-
tectly right, only the unfortunate obscurity of the state-
ment prevents the fact appearing so clearly as it should do.

The fearfully and wonderfully reconstructed
N. 4. Loan and Mercantile Agency Co. has made a
loss, according to the cabled information, of £28,393
According to the reconstruction scheme the Loan
and Mercantile owes £2,370,000 “4 per cent, prior
hen debenture stock,” which is a first charge on the
assets. If the co. wants to pay this off it must
[5£1"230 000 of 8 *- s or every t fl ! W , borrowed - Then there
is £1,230,000 of 5 per cent. A debenture stock,” which
” mortgage on the assets, and is redeemable at
£lO5 for every £lOO of the original borrowings. After
that £1,050,000 “5 per cent. B debenture stock” consti-
tutes a third mortgage, and is also redeemable at £lO5
Then £700,000 worth of preference shares get a look-in
and are entitled to a 5 per cent, dividend if there is
enough left over after satisfying the “ 5 per cent. B ” cor-
morants ; and finally, the ordinary shares, which are also
partly preference, come at the extreme rear of the pro-
cession. At latest advices from London the “ prior lien
stock, which gets the first grab at everyt! • '.ng, was worth
about par, but the “5 per cent. B debenture stock”
which was only third claim, was barely worth £25. When
a 5 per cent, stock only commands one-fourth of its
nominal value in London it must be regarded there as a
pret„y weak investment. As for the preference and
ordinary shares, they seem at present unsaleable.
The N.Z. Loan and Mercantile lately wrote
£64 i.OOO off its assets, and the cable speaks of a further
writing down of £847,000. Considering this stupendous
depreciation, and the very heavy interest payable
on the reconstructed debentures, and the loss on
operations, and the recent raising of £400,000 more
“ prior lien debenture stock,” and the dismal trade pros-
pects ahead, and the fact that the Loan and Mercantile is
pledged£o pay about £173,00f) in premiums for the privi-
lege of liquidating its debenture liabilities when it is able
to do so, it would seem that the institution has been re-
constructed in a rather disastrous fashion. Also, its wild
confusion of “prior lien” and “A ” and “B ” stocks, and
shares, and ordinary shares which are partly
preference, but apparently not quite so preference as the
other lot, and partly ordinary, or partly ordinary and
partly not quite so ordinary, is a tangle and a misery
which only a German mathematician can unravel.

It is cabled from London that the proposed
reconstruction of the E.B. and A. Bank meets with cordial
approval there. In other words, the British shareholder
oorclially approves of the proposal to reduce the interest
oi the Australian inscribed stockholder to li per cent, if
necessary. Not one of the Australian reconstructed banks
of issue now living has out down the English depositor
anything like so low as this. And, even when he was
reduced on a much more moderate scale, that English
depositor didn t cordially approve by any means.

hand, with a view to launching out into more beer on a

National Bank of Australasia deposits have
risen to over 195., and a rumor is abroad that the National
will presently set all its deposits free. Its great trouble
has been the terms of its reconstruction scheme, which
made it somewhat difficult to release the fixed money by
instalments, as was done by the North Queensland and
Commercial of Sydney. To turn loose £5,000,000 of fixed
deposits m a lump is a large order, but judging by appear-
ances, the National could do it if it cared to try. Most
of the money would certainly be renewed at a lower rate
of interest, and the saving to the bank should be £40,000
a year at the least.

A harmless youth, employed in the Post-office,
appeared last week in the Sydney bankruptcy court and
told a pathetic tale of usury. His troubles began with
losing 16s. which belonged to his father. He didn’t care
to explain the circumstances to the old man, so he bor-
rowed £5 off a money-lender and made good the defl-
Cl u ncy A N( )t being able to overtake the debt and interest
when they fell due he borrowed off a second money-lender
to partly pacify the first one. The interest on the second
loan also kept mounting up faster than he could overtake
it, so he borrowed from four other money-lenders in suc-
cession, the money he got from each one going to mollify
the one before. His salary was £lO a month, and for 12
months the money-lenders drew it on his account all ex-
cept £1 ss. a month. At the end of the 12 months he
owed one man £44 10s. and an indefinite amount to the
other five or six, all of which grew out of the original

Chamberlain, British Colonial Secretary, pro-
poses to start an inquiry into the causes why the trade
of the kawhmes is drifting away from England to
foreign countries. In 11 years (1881-92) the exports from
Australasm, to foreign countries increased 325 per cent
while the exports to Britain increased only 25 per cent.
Also, the imports from foreign countries increased 33 per
cent., while those from Britain improved by only about
li per cent. These figures make J. Bull feel verv mad
indeed. And he is especially mad because the sales df
ixerman goods in Australasia increased by over £1.160 000
J® ars A. wh i le . , tho . s e of British goods rose by only
£400,000. The sight of those words “ made in Germany”
is becoming a nightmare in Bull-land.

Banks and life-assurance societies can be roughly
divided into three classes : those that are sound; those
j™ look sound by their balance-sheets, but are not:
and those which don’t look sound, and are not. And the
first t\yo Jots will remain hopelessly undistinguishable to
fbo public until the Stiite audit conies along. Also the
third-class is tolerably undistinguishable, too, because
hardly anybody,understands figures, or cares about them.

A Melbourne man, who was accidentally killed
a few months ago, had his life assured under an accident
poho y in one of the local societies, but the deceased’s
tamil y did not discover the existence of the policy until
12 days after his death. Their claim is now legally out
of court under one of the society’s rules, which fs printed
on the form signed by the assured, and which states that
written notice of death must- be sent to the office
within seven days from date of the accident. The society
thus gets a considerable start, as in a number of cases the
assured has his affairs and papers so mixed up that the house
has to be searched from roof to basement before matters
can be squared up, and, considering that 72 hours are
generally taken up in attending to the dead and its dis-
posal, four days only remain to ferret out the documents,
known and unknown, that he may have left behind, and
if it wasn’t known where the deceased had planted his
policy, the co. can calmly reckon upon “ a skinner.” For
the future, policy-holders -had better nail the agreement
over the mantelpiece, and if the assured happens to sud-
denly “ cop out,” one of the family should rush and
notify the society concerned there and then.

All Broken Hill shares have moved up rapidly,
and the talk is of a further large advance alter Christmas.
Three things are primarily responsible for the movement;
the proof afforded by dividends that, though a tremendous
deal of the metal in the sulphides is wasted, profits are
still left; the improved prospects of the Proprietary,
British, Junction, and South; and the general impression
that the future of the silver market is more certain. The
last-named is really the most important cause of the
three.
. The Pinnacles, near Broken Hill, long prac-
tically abandoned, is to be re-worked ; for a start 16 men
have been put on. The mine compares favorably with
some; though that, unfortunately, is not saying much.
Another old-time property whose ghostly countenance
begins to look out again from the mining reports is the
Day Dream, which is to'be re-floated, if possible, on the
strength of improved methods of dealing with sulphides,
though how these improved methods can affect the Day
Dream is not very clear. An effort is also being made to
re-fioat the Gipsy Girl, at Thackaringa, a little lead show,
which might manage to pay small divs. on a very small
capital.

The notorious Field of Mars (N.S. W.) tramway
agitation was brought before Parliament the other day,
and the proposal to send the scheme to the Public Works
Committee was negatived by a Parliamentary vote of 2 to
I—hence the purchasers are now clamoring for a refund
of their money with 8 percent, compound interest! When
the land was sold some ten years ago, some sort of official
promise—which ought never to have been made was
given to the effect that a tramway would be constructed
to bring the district into direct communication with the
metropolis. As a result, good prices were realised, not
from bona fide settlers, but from various speculators and
capitalists who thought they had a really good thing.

The syndicate working the Cobar copper-mine
is preparing to increase its output by the erection of

Three schemes, e ; i mated to cost respectively
£6,000,000, £4,000,000, and £1,250,000, are on foot to
supply water tor Ooolgardie, and the Government reckons
the necessary cash can be borrowed in London without
any difficulty. The last-mentioned scheme is to supply
water -1,000,000 gallons daily for domestic purposes
only. Making some small allowance for the fact that
estimates always fall short of reality, even the cheapest
of the three projects means that Ooolgardie will be bur-
dened with a water-debt fully half as large as that of
Sydney, for one-thirteenth the supply and about one-
twentieth the population, so that the rates must be about
ten times as heavy. And there is always the chance that
Ooolgardie will depart bodily some day, and leave its
railway sticking out aimlessly into the desert, and its big
reservoir abandoned to the crabs and eels, and its big
debt a wasted overdraft howling in the wilderness.
A vague, moaning whisper also goes round about
a syndicate, with £250,000 capital, which wants to construct
a water-supply for Ooolgardie and adjacent districts.
Any man who has seriously considered that arid region,
and thinks it can be supplied with water for an outlay of
£250,000, is probably in an advanced state of mental
decomposition.

year will probably see a revival. Beyond the possible

to pay his travelling and other expenses. Fancy being

Marmion, W.A. ex-Minister of Mines, at Cool-
gardie sneermgly alluded to the fact that the people
who complained of the apathy of the Forrest Govt.
“ came there without invitation.” The phrase expresses
to a nicety the feelings of the “ six families” and a lot of
other Westralians. Easterners are never welcomed. The
ruling Westralians were quite satisfied to go on with-their
land-grant-railway schemes, their land corporations, and
their sandal-wood monopolies. Their Constitutional
Govt, was a mockery and their Parliament a farce. But
for the goldfields discovered by ‘’t’othersiders” and boomed
by a wasteful expenditure of J. Bull’s capital, unprece-
dented in any other part of Australia, their railways one
of which was working at a loss of £5OO a week—and the
entire country would be absolutely and irredeemably
bankrupt. While nine-tenths of the “ t’othersiders ” are
imbued with but one object—money-making—they are
safe, but the time will soon come for other phases of the
serious business of life, and with that time the Forrest
crowd will pass out.
Big developments said to have occurred in the
“ Three Jolly Britons ” mine, three miles from Coolgardie.
“The mine is expected to be one of the trump-cards of
the district.” How many trump-cards are there within
three miles of Coolgardie ? “ Three Jolly Britons " 1 Tub
nm.r.KTi.v foresees a time when there will be 30,000 or more
melancholy Britons.

Coolgardie wire—a fair specimen :—“ Fresh
water has been struck in another well at the west end of
the town. This makes eight fresh-water wells in Cool-
gardie.” If they struck an underground river there it
would mean that Bayley’s 20-heads, Bayley’s South 10-
heads, Tindall’s 10-heads, Big Blow 20-heads, Bendigo
Coolgardie 15-heads, and other batteries would have to
start on the “ great heaps of rich stone ” lying anywhere
and everywhere around the town. The thought of it is
too horrible. The man who strikes a body of water suffi-
cient for such a purpose should be drowned in it, as a
slight retribution for a crime worse than murder.

Princess Ada, Cue, 570 z. “ Considering the

Poor BayJey’s mill shut down, shares down to
35., and now the manager has resigned. Why doesn’t
somebody reprint some old newspaper extracts to prove
that there was once a mine at Coolgardie named Bayfey’s 1
Otherwise, the odds will be laid against it.

White Feather Reward (W.A.), second month’s
crushing, 250 tons, 4X4oz. :—“ The small result is due to
the fact that a quantity of low-grade ore was put through
in mistake.” Who is going to be made the victim of this
hideous blunder ? If the mine can keep up loz. 13dwts.,
some people, if not the shareholders, will be surprised.
The latest from Coolgardie is the discovery oi
an alleged 300 oz. slug on the Northern Consols mine,
owned by the All Nations Prospecting Co., of Adelaide.

Though the average Coolgardie man will rave if
it is suggested that Hannan’s may, after all, prove the
real goldfields metropolis, and Coolgardie itself be only an
accident, he doesn’t back his alleged convictions any too
lavishly. The burnt portion of the town is being re-built
in the old, flimsy fashion, so that it can be taken up by
the roots and moved on at the shortest notice. Hardly
anybody cares to bet on his opinions just yet with any-
thing much more permanent than galvanised-iron.

Lansell is determined to carry out his pet scheme
of connecting the Sheepshead and Garden Gully lines at
Bendigo. Seine time ago the Warden forfeited one of his
leases on his proposed line of work, and now, to overcome
that difficulty, he intends to mine under nine streets. It
is a big work, and only a man with LanselTs strong heart
—and cash—would undertake it.

at 1000 ft., which quickly jumped from 1 to 7ft. wide, has
now pinched to 4ft. At the North Long Tunnel they are
crosscutting for the Long Tunnel reef, and hope to reach
it within the next four months.

At a recent meeting of shareholders of a Mel-
bourne co., after a div. of eight per cent, had been
declared, and the usual congratulatory speeches made to
the manager, a brother of the manager’s remarked that
he did not see any cause for congratulation in such a divi-
dend. On being asked if he could suggest any means by
which it might be increased, he advised the reduction of
the salaries of the manager (his brother aforesaid) and the
other employes. Since this particular descendant of
Abraham bought, the market value of the shares has
doubled.

At last, after years of call-paying and plucky
work, the South Star mine, near the Star of the East,
Ballarat, has started div.-paying. Truly, boom-mining
has more attractions.

Gold-mines, as a rule, come and go, but Mt.
Morgan goes on for ever. It is the world’s great gold-
mine. There are two or three on the Rand that have a
bigger monthly yield on a much bigger tonnage, but on
total production and divs. (for this half-year ±150,000) no
mine in the world comes near it.

The spiritualistic medium who started some
cranks boring for a coal-mine at St. Kilda Bluff (Meib.)
is evidently controlled by Nicodemus. The spirit is
known among his faithful ‘‘circle” as “the Old Gent”—
he never told them which Old Gent they had struck.
There’s no doubt that the bore will arrive at splendid
black coal eventually but not yet. Sheol is a long way
down, and thus far they have only penetrated 3500 feet of
upper crust.

The present move of a well-advertised Melb.
defendant is to discover who are his unrelenting oppo-
nent’s financial backers in order to sue them for the
offence called “ maintenance.” Such an enquiry was
foreseen, however, and the other fellow’s friends have
taken care to cover up their tracks.

Another of Melbourne’s oldest wholesale liquor

During a recent land-case, heard in Melbourne,
it transpired that the mortgagee had advanced £5OOO on
the property, had never had a penny of principal
returned, or a farthing of the interest, and had to pay a
man IT a week to mind the security, as nobody would buy
it. Also, the mortgagor can’t be got at, as he is doing a'
lengthy “ bit ’’ in gaol.

Warden Haldane on the Etheridge : “ The
prosperity of this goldfield is easy to foretell. In my first
historical record of 1887, I said Charters Towers would be
the-most prosperous and productive of all Australian
goldfields. I now have no hesitation in saying that the
Etheridge will support a population by the hundred
thousand. For the past 15 years the average yield has
been some 20,0000 z., increasing spasmodically up to
30,0000 z. (with a mere handful of miners) which last I put
as the lowest limit of production. The proposed railway
lines will open up (it is estimated) about 79 per cent, of
the auriferous country of Queensland.” It must not,
however, be forgotten that a capital running into millions
has been wasted on Warden Haldane’s Eldorado.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and novv, after
long years of careful and diligent research, a ,- t has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oais ia the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex«
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.
Personal Items.
The estate of Samuel Wilson, K.C.M.G.,
has panned out for £517,000.
The Dean conspiracy case was practically
a R.C. suit from beginning to end. Most of the
accused, and all the leading solicitors and barristers
engaged, were prominent “ Romans.”
Professor Kernot, M.1.C.E., is Melb.’s
oldest cyclist. His vagaries on a boneshaker in
unmacadamised Clarendon-street, East Melb.,
afforded general public entertainment away back
in ’69.
The sub-editor of a certain Sydney daily
works from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. on soda-biscuit and
cold tea. Yet that fare is game and champagne
to the literary dry-tack and washy insipidities he
has to mentally digest.

The solicitor who drew up the brief tor
Parnell’s defence has been for some time manager
of a big Sydney solicitors’ business. He says that
the brief took him two months’ daily labor, includ-
ing Sundays, to draw, and that it weighed three-
quarters of a cwt.
Saul Samuel has been N.S.W. Agent-
General almost one-half the whole period of the
existence of the position. One Hamilton opened
the office in ’63, and he and five successors disap-
peared from the scene in the time covered by the
reign of the veteran Saul.
Peacock, Yic. Minister of Education, is a
busy man with a short pipe whose official minutes
are models of brevity and decision. One of his
recent ones, noted on the foot of an application
for more salary, read: “He should be damn
thankful for what he’s got.”
Chief-Sec. Gordon (S.A.) leaves for Eng-
land in January, with two or three Westralian
companies in his pockets. Gordon is the orator of
the Kingston Ministry, and is very popular pro-
vinoially ; his absence will be felt by the demo-
cratic party during the election campaign.
Saturday Review, noticing Miss Mur-
phy’s book, “ One Woman’s Wisdom,” brackets it
with five others, and briefly remarks : These six
books bore, but Miss Murphy’s bores most of all;
what it is all about Heaven and Miss Murphy

G. M. O’Rorke, Speaker of Maoriland
H. of R., though a cultured gentleman and a B. A.,
has never been able to conquer his brogue. Every
afternoon the press-gallery waits with anticipatory
mirth for “ Sir Maurice ”to announce that the
annerable number for So-and-so will now move

On a recent Xmas the Bishop of an Aus-
tralian diocese, returning (first-class, of course)
®n an ocean liner from a trip to Europe, was asked
to contribute to a fund, initiated _in the second-
class, to give the children in the third-class a treat.
His lordship gave —sixpence. “ buffer the little
children to come unto Me. ”
Blake, the Anglo-Canadian M.P., now
umpiring the M.L. Midland railway dispute,
addressed the Wellington college boys recently as
foil jws : “ In the art of speaking there are two
useful rules —never speak unless you have some-
thing to say ; always stop when you have done
saying it.” Politicians, stick this m your hats.
Poynter, S.M. at Invercargill (M.L.), has
formulated two useful rules for the guidance of
solicitors practising in his court : (1) No comment
shall be made while a witness is giving evidence.
(2) Observations and remarks concerning each
other must not be exchanged between solicitors
engaged in a case, but must be addressed to the
court.” In future, instead of “You’re a liar,” the
form of compliment will be, “Permit me to in-
form your worship that my learned friend is a
Jabez Balfour, who couldn’t have been a
more unprincipled and colder-blooded swindler
than Mat. Larkin, got as much punishment in one
legal act as his South Melb. brother got in three.
The mill of the Law was a long time in arriving
at Jabez, but it ground him small when the time
came. Fourteen years. They didn’t trouble to
try Jabez on any other charges.
Virgil Power has been appointed to the
vacant Queensland judgeship, and will be exiled
to dreary Rockhampton. Power will probably
make a respectable though not specially brilliant
Judge, but his long experience as Crown Prose-
cutor is against him. A lengthy spell of looking
only at the Crown side of the case is bad for the
judicial faculty. Once a prosecutor, always a
prosecutor.
Of the Victorian Judges, writes a lawyer,
Holroyd is sound. Madden is also sound —
chiefly sound. A’Beckett is often sound —sound
asleep. Hood as a good Judge (if his health lasts)
is more than probable; Williams, through lazi-
ness, is improbable ; Hodges is impossible.
Rumored, by the way, that Williams, J., will
retire as soon as his 15 years are up (early next
year), whereupon Isaacs will probably say to a
well-known Equity man, “ Go up Topp!”
Queen Victoria is crippled, apparently
beyond remedy, from rheumatism, the result of
sitting in a cold draught for 60 years. Her pre-
sent Gracious has kept the window open through
all her long reign in a bleak climate, and has
mostly dispensed with a fire, and thereby she has
seriously inconvenienced Battenberg—whose knees
were much exposed in his kilt—and other relatives.
Now it is alleged that nothing in the world can
cure her, save a course of hot baths at Rotorua
(M.L.), but she is hardly likely to get so far.
Parson-editor Fitchett is not a humorist.
Reprinting “Hop.’s” expressive picture of
manager Dibbs’s breezy way with savings-bank
customers, he cuts the tail off the devil, and repre-
sents Dam chicago as saying, “Well, old girl, what
the d can we do for you ? ” —which is almost
as snappy and humorous as a Wesleyan prayer-
fight. If a holy editor must use an artist’s best
work at secondhand, it is only just that he should
not Bowdlerise it. Also, is Satan a pulpit mono-
poly ?
One of Victoria’s notabilities, who quietly
faded away amidst the crash of the bursting boom,
was old John Nimmo. Nobody missed him, no-
body seemed to know where he had gone, and
nobody in particular cared. It now appears that
he has finally settled down in his native town, in
Scotland, where he holds the same billet —as a
small municipal official —that he filled when a lad,
40 years ago. Also, he holds it at almost the
same salary. Poor, decent old Nimmo has just
got back to his starting-point.
Nothing annoys Rogers, Q.C., more than
a casual reference to the Dean case. To think that
he had the police and central eriminal court evi-
dence before him, and did not notice the incom-
pleteness of chemist Smith’s examination, makes
the ex-Judge wild. ‘ ‘ That that singular omission
escaped my attention is most extraordinary ! ” he
says—refusing to find comfort in the fact that the
same “singular omission” did not occur to the
P.M., or the Crown-Solicitor, or prosecutor Wade,
or Attorney-General Want, or Judge Windeyer,
or Salomons, Q.C., or the North Shore committee
—or anybody else.
Judge Hodges (Vic.) passes a good part of
his leisure during the hot season in St. Hilda
baths, where, with his clothes off, he looks pain-
fully like anybody else. Hodges on the bench is
a man of great weight and dignity, and some of
his remarks to discharged prisoners who, in his
opinion, shouldn’t have been discharged, are sug-
gestive of the Almighty reproving a black beetle,
but when he flounders heavily in a crowded swim-
ming bath things are very different. The object
of the judicial robes is to establish a theory that
a Judge has no legs, and a Judge taking a header
is destructive to this tradition.
One Smith, on the
N.W. coast, Tas., has

Collingwood (Vic.)
court-house, like many
others, has got its local
crank. She is an elderly
woman who long ago got
some kind of grievance
against the law over the
division of some pro-
perty. Being a resi-
dent of Collingwood she
assumes that, somehow or
other, at some time or
other, the law will re-
dress her grievance there,
so for a year or two she
has sat in the court every
day listening to the
drunks and assaults and
the other business, and
waiting for her dead and
§one case to come on.
he comes early lest the
court should want her as
a witness at 10 sharp,
and goes away late lest
her case should be settled
suddenly after she has
departed, and she will
probably die or go ac-
tively mad there at last,
and thereby draw some
real attention to her case
for the first and last
time.
Mekeruki Aewa, one of those toothless
native veterans so plentiful in Maoriland, died the
other day at a place as unpronounceable as himself
—Awahuri, in the Rangitikei district. Rumor
had it that he was 120—at all events, many other
old, toothless and unpronounceable gentlemen of
these parts averred that when they were boys
Mekeruki was already a person of very great
antiquity. He didn’t fight in the wars with the
white men, but during the Waikato disturbance
his tribe marched down from the Whakatane
district to Manawatu and licked .the Parawanui
tribe out of Rangitikei, and it took the old man
three months after that to pick the consonants
and initials out of his feet.
Parkes is to get a grant of £lO,OOO if the
Reid Government doesn’t change its mind before
next session, and if it can pass the measure, and if
the object of its sympathy doesn’t write too much
poetry in the interval and thereby disgust his
sympathisers. It is generally understood that the
aged politician has again fallen upon evil days.
Most of the public subscription of a few
years ago has been ‘ ‘ reconstructed ” in various
ways, and the income it yields now is
hardly worth mentioning. Politics and “ hoffis
have both left Parkes in his latter days, and there

is a tacit understanding that, if he gets the above
donation, he won’t renew the useless scramble
after either of them —if he can help it. But then
Parkes can’t help it. The spectacle of a general
election is to him what a cask of whisky is to a
dipsomaniac. Also, if he is to get anything it
should be an annuity, payable monthly, without
power of anticipation. Parkes can’t keep money.
W. Martin, the Yankee long-distance
cyclist, rides with a big-geared machine and an
iron jaw. Of all the cyclists now going for their
oats in Australia there is no more determined
man than Martin, and, given fair treatment by
handicappers, he should have a fair granary at the
season’s end. Till this year Martin was a long-
distance cyclist—went in for six days’ contests—
seeing how long a man could, live on a bicycle, _&c.
Now Martin has gone in for sprint racing,
and seems to have come to the conclusion that
spectators watching a man six days to see how
long he will keep fresh get as much enjoyment as
in watching a corpse six days to see how long it
will keep fresh. Last season Martin won some
70 races in Italy and France. At the last Austral
meeting he ran four consecutive firsts one after-

noon, beating Parsons in the final heat of the
One-mile Intercolonial Scratch-race. This is his
first big Australian victory. Martin is such a
plugger that he is inclined to race too often on
the one day—he should get wiser ; race less and
win more.
Dear Bulletin, —Tas. Judge Adams is as
wee as you make him ; yet he has been twice mar-
ried —each time to a wife twice as big as himself.
In private life he is kind and considerate, but in
court he is noted for long sentences and want of
humanity in dealing with criminals. As a rule,
the smallest judge gives the longest sentences,
perhaps because he is perpetually troubled with
the idea that the prisoner is looking disrespectfully
at his scanty proportions. When a 6-foot prisoner
is brought before a 4-foot judge, whose feet don 1
reach the ground, it is difficult for the latter tc
feel good toward him.— I Theta.
A recently -acquitted alleged abortionist in
Queensland is said to have unbosomed himself
in gaol to a fellow prisoner. According to the
evidence of the latter, his prison comrade gave
him a full description of the modus operandi of his
business, illustrated by sketches on the gaol table.
This article of furniture was produced in court,
the sketches being still visible. The unspeakable
fatuity of some prisoners beggars all description.
Man-o’-warsman Lynch, the
murderer, told sailor Howell, Go-
vernor of Adelaide Gaol, the night
before he was hanged, that “he
wouldn’t disgrace him and would
play the man ” —which he did.
Nevertheless, Howell had the plank
put across the drop at the last
moment lest Lynch’s nerve might
fail him. When Lynch was stand-
ing on the scaffold, after the cap
was drawn over his head, awaiting
the sheriff’s signal, an official moved
the ponderous plank away with
his foot. The harsh grating sound
must have been a horrible strain
on Lynch’s nerves, creating the
impression that the drop was
going, but he never moved a
muscle.
Some years ago, when Hori
Grey was living in Wellington
(M.L.), his musical ear was very
much offended at the discordant
notes of an untuned piano in an
adjoining house. There were six
daughters in the establishment, and
as they were all “ pursuing their
musical studies ” the ill-used instru-
ment wailed forth its wrongs from
morning till night. At last, Grey,
in desperation, laid in wait for the
gaunt she-parent of the six girls,
and with great unctuoiishess pre-
sented her with a handful of tickets
to a concert to be held that after-
noon, at the Exhibition. “ Your
little ones are so fond of music,”
sighed the great pro-consul. That
afternoon, Grey and Jidus Achates
Eeldwick watched the dame and
her brood safely off the premises,
and very soon after the two states-
men and a piano-tuner were in the
drawing-room next door tuning the
piano as if the fate of the Ministry
depended on getting it in order.
The musical family never noticed
the difference.
Satan reproving sin is a lot better than no
one reproving it at all.
Melb. : ‘ ‘ Another account says the first
name of our city was Beargrass. ”
Coningham, the irrepressible Queensland
athlete, is shown in the accompanying por-
trait off the wires, so to speak, and in repose,
but what he is really like can only be understood
from his history. In ’B2, when lh years of age (he
is now 29), he won several pigeon-shooting
matches. He won the Melbourne Cricket Club’s
bowling trophy with an average of nine runs per
wicket in the ’B3-84 season, and took it to Brisbane
with him along with a medal gained for saving
life in Hobson’s Bay. During the eight seasons
he has played cricket in Queensland he has every
season won both bowling and batting averages of
his club, and has come out on top in the bowling
averages of all Queensland for seven seasons. His
batting record for ’9l was 96 runs per innings, and
his bowling 96 wickets at five runs per wicket.
Against the ’B9 Melbourne team he secured nine
wickets and scored 85 runs, not out. He
did most of the beating when Queensland
beat Syd. Gregory’s ’B9 Sydney team ; for
he downed seven Sydneyites for 37 runs first
innings, and six for 32 in the second. Playing
for the Brisbane Stanley O.C. against Alberts in
’9l he scored 26 runs (not out) off seven balls,
while the rest of his side each made a blob. He
scored 75 runs in 25 minutes for Stanley against
Graziers in ’92; this score included seven fivers.
He and Percy M‘Donnell, against a Townsville
18, scored 81 runs in 18 minutes, the first four
overs yielding 16, 14, 14, and 15. Coningham’s
biggest score was his 153, for Sydney against
Northern Districts, in ’92. His recent 151 and 51
against N.S.W. show that, as a batsman, he’s
beyond N.S.W. bowlers. He went to England
with the Australian Eleven in ’93, and was very
badly treated by that eminently shabby aggrega-
tion. During that visit he distinguished himself
by saving a boy’s life on the Thames, and received
a handsome medal. As a side-issue, Coning-
ham thinks the Englishman Richardson the best
bowler he ever met; Syd. Gregory the best cover-
point ; Atkins the best mid-off. He ranks Donnan
as the best batsman in Australia for suiting his
play to the wicket, and perhaps the hardest Aus-
tralian batsman to get-out, and reckons he should
be picked as one of the first three batsmen for the
next Australian Eleven. Coningham is a fast ped.
—has won 170 races altogether at distances of fifty
yards to five miles. In ’B7 he won <£soo in Bris-
bane handicaps and hurdle-races, and between ’B5
and ’B9 he won every hurdle-race he started in.
In ’BB he beat Bird over five miles for <£so a-side.
Same year he won £l2O in a pyramid-match.
Playing football in ’9O he broke his neck, or some
equally serious part of himself, and took sixteen
weeks in hospital. Later he severely injured his
heart, but cured it by getting married, and becom-
ing the author of a little left-hand bowler.
Altogether, the accomplished youth is born
behind his time. He should have lived in the
days of knight errantry, and shone in plumes and
armor, and gone a-grailing with a spear before
him and a rescued princess behind him on the
saddle. He can probably do more different things
than any other athlete in Australia, and he does
them all well; also, he has the great virtue of
being a humorist, whereas most of his kind take
themselves and their muscles with intense serious-
ness.

POLITICAL
POINTS
“ The planters are the backbone of Queens-
land ” and the Kanakas are the bone-dust.
In N.S. Wales Legislative Council are six
doctors of medicine and five doctors of laws.
It is prophesied that the three “ windy ”
members of S.A. Assembly—Moule, Castine, and
Caldwell—wdl be defeated at the March elections.
The trouble is that perhaps three “ windier ” men
may take their places.
The Oppositionists in Kauriland are
already forming the coming Ministry—among the
leaders being Stout, Captain Russell, Duthie and
Larnach—and are selling Seddon’s skin while that
large, brawny ex-publican is still alive.
Julian Salomons, Q.C., M.L.0., received
in fees from N.S.W. Treasury for the year ending
Oct. 3, 1895, .£1420. 0. G. Heydon, M.L.C.,
during the same period received .£9l. The fees
for prosecuting George Dean and his associates
have not yet been paid.
Politics run a good deal to hair in N.S.
Wales ; witness Parkes. In the present Assembly
there are only nine bald heads among 126 mem-
bers. Premier Reid narrowly escapes making the
tenth by carefully cultivating a wisp of hair across
his cranium from the left side.
S.A. is going to take a ballot of the electors
on the question of Bible-teachingin public-schools.
The result should be a foregone conclusion. The
Scriptural crowd is small but enthusiastic, and its
great aggregate parson will hustle it along to the
poll to the last man. The secularists are many
but apathetic, and they have no black-coated
army to round them up, so they will poll badly.
The people who want to do something, even if it
is a profoundly stupid thing, are always more
active than the ppople who sknply want to leave
something undone, no matter how much reason
there may be for leaving it undone.
The Mo olap
Lands Bill provides
for the granting of a
75 years’ lease of a
slice of Corio Bay
(Vic.) foreshore to a
salt manufacturer
named Cheetham.
Cheetham is 75 years
of age, and will be
150 when the lease
runs out; in the
meantime, he wants
to make salt with the
assistance of the pro-
tective duty. He has
been making salt for
some time, but desires
to get hold of a tenure
he can raise capital
on, and a 75 years’
lease of the barren bit
of coast is considered
good enough. Long-
more wanted to make
the tenure 50 years
only, so as to give
Cheetham time to
rest before he died,
but Madden com-
plained that this limi-
tation would strangle
a promising industry
—though how a pro-
tected industry could
deserve anything else
than strangulation
that usually violent
Freetrader forget to
say. Hume Cook
moved that no adult
on the works should
be paid less than 9d.
an hour wages—6s. a
day whereupon
Murray Smith said
that the Labor-party
was a curse to the
country. Madden
sneered that it was
now an offence to
make things cheap;
Trenwith retorted
that the sin was in
making men cheap.
Therefore it seems
that Freetraders Mad-
den and Murray
Smith, who say that
Protection is a curse
and an extortion,
would rather see the
profits remain with
the extortioner than
insist on a reasonable
proportion being
divided among his work-people. Protection may
be bad in the eyes of Madden and Smith, but
ihe minimum wage idea is loathsome and un-
speakably awful.
M‘Elhone, M.L.A., opposes the Randwick
Cemetery Closing Bill on the ground that he often
passes the place and has never yet noticed any
offensive odor. M'Elhone was educated in the
hide, tallow and boiling-down business, so possibly
his sense of smell has become blunted. His
language is also of the hide and boiling-down
variety.
All the Sydney papers, except the silent
and always non-committal S.M. Herald, have
used language about the Government’s doings in
the matter of Crick’s arrest which should make it
deeply regret that it ever took Attorney-General
Want to its capacious bosom. The Bulletin
adheres to its prophecy that the Reid Ministry
will die by the hand of J. Want.
Ex-Premier Shiels must have made about
half-a-dozen wild attacks on the Victorian Govern-
ment within the past two years. The rest of the
time he has generally been away from the House
—sick. Nervousness, worry, disappointment,
boom losses, and the consciousness that he got his
one great chance a year or two ago and muddled
it away are Shiels’s malady.
When Treasurer Ward returned to Maori-
land he brought with him a most expensive rig-out
made by a Piccadilly snip. His appearance on
the Ministerial benches created a profound sensa-
tion, and during the tariff discussion invidious
comparisons were drawn between his fashionable
“clobber” and the plebeian store clothes of
Premier Seddon. A politician who rises in im-
ported clothes to advocate a Protective tariff is an
anomaly.
S.A. Assembly practically terminated its
existence last week, as a general election takes
place in March. The general belief is that it was
the worst Assembly S.A. ever had. It was sadly
deficient in brains ; but for solid jaw it was points
above the most verbose clerical congress. Despite
all this, it did good work, thanks to the Kingston
Govt, and the Labor-party, and many democratic
measures were passed in the face of persistent
Tory stonewalling.
On Ist Jan., ’95, the N.S.W, duties on pic-
tures, statuary, pianos, silks, satins, lace, jewellery,
carriages, precious stones, high silk hats, patent-
leather boots, -and many similar articles, will be
abolished. But the duties on coffee, cocoa, corn-
flour, rice, salt, sugar, jam candles, kerosene, &c.,
remain on for the present. The Reid Govern-
ment’s yearning to cheapen the things which enter
into the daily consumption of the working man
sticks out here like a bowsprit.
Again the statement has been made in
N.S.W. Parliament that previous to Judge Back-
house sentencing solicitor Rofe, the latter’s counsel
interviewed him in private. For the sake of
public decency it would be well if the truth or
otherwise of this matter were fully known. If
untrue, then a denial from 0. G. Heydon will be
ample and sufficient; and, if true or only partly
true, it is incumbent on either the Judge or bar-
rister or both to explain at once.
r
I
WHAT THEY CALL A BOOM NOW.
“There are signs of a decided move towards a return of prosperity in
the city and suburbs. ” — News of the day.
CLERGYMAN : “ Well, sir, how's business ?”
TRADESMAN : “ Tip-top. I went within an ace of making my rent last
week.”
Tozer remarks complacently in the Kanaka-
land Assembly, by way of apology for the homi-
cidal South Sea heathen: “ The Kanakas may
commit crimes against the person, but certainly
not against property. ” Which accounts for the
equanimity with which the Boodlewraith regards
recent Polynesian outrages. So long as the brown
savage doesn’t go round making a brutal assault
on the bullion or stoushing • the overdraft in the
eye, nothing else matters much. Meanwhile, it is
learn that there are twice as many
Kanakas as white Queenslanders in gaol, in pro-
portion to their numbers, and the cost of locking
up the murderous nigger is becoming a very
serious item of expendi ure.
Crick was acquitted on Tuesday night, and
on Wednesday morning it was announced that
Attorney-General Want was leaving for Japan by
Saturday s steamer. Therefore, quite a lot of
things which Crick still desires to say to Want must
stand Oyer for two or three months. Considering
that Crick has had to listen otf-and-on for some
weeks to what Want had to say (per medium of
xleydon), this hat refusal of Want’s to stay and
listen to what Crick has to say looks mean.
A Bill has been presented to the U.S.
Senate for the expenditure of .£20,500,000 on
armaments. This may not mean war with Britain
over the Venezuelan difficulty, but it looks
seriously like it. Congress has also voted =£20,000
to cover the expense of determining the frontier
between Guiana and Venezuela, and as Britain
professes that it will see the States in a place un-
mentionable before it allows any interference
with that frontier this is another aggravation.
During the debate on J. C. Neild’s motion
m N. S. W. Assembly re sweating in the clothing
trade, Premier Reid declared loftily that he
would ‘ smash up ” any contract the principals
or which could be shown to be fattening on the
dire necessities of the poor. There is no legal
power to do the aforesaid smash, and G. Reid has
mine nothing, so far, towards getting that power.
He simply undertakes to go out alone on
his own personal smash, which is mere childish
blow.”
Premier Kingston’s Law Reform Bill
struck against the usual Upper House snag and
foundered by a large majority. An Australian
Premier who carries democratic measures through
the Assembly generally does it knowing that they
will be lost in the ‘ ‘ other place. ” Therefore, if he
introduces them, the Assembly seldom takes him
seriously, and lets them go in any shape ; and, if
he doesn t introduce them, the House and the
country want to know why he is going back on
his principles.
Crick’s first public act, on his re-appear-
ance in N.S.W. Parliament, was to dump down
a resolution that the retention of Attorney-General
Want in the Ministry was “ a standing disgrace
to decent and honest government. ” This interest-
ing motion was choked off, however, by Reid, on
the thin pretence that the matter was still sub
judice. The obvious fact that Crick’s matter had
ceased to be sub judicc stared everybody in the
face, but even a thin excuse is better than none,
especially at the fag-end of the session.
When Crick was out on bail awaiting trial
he appeared in court in connection with a case,
and the Judge informed him pretty plainly that
he had better not conduct cases in court until his
trial was over. The Law says it assumes every
man to be innocent until he is proved guilty; but,
in reality, it assumes every man guilty until he
proves himself innocent. Therefore, it assumed
Crick to be guilty, and shut-down on him accord-
ingly. The Bulletin would hardly mind the Law
being the ass it is if it wasn’t such a hypocrite.
As an illustration of the state of S.A.
politics, the National Ass crowd now' owns nearly
the whole of the S.A. provincial newspapers. The
policy of “ muzzling ” the press was commenced
when the Labor-party collared numerous Con-
servative seats in 1893, and in 1896 the voice of the
country papers will go out in one harmonious bray
for the Ass candidates. In spite of this the Labor-
party expects to gain two or three Assembly seats
next year. The village settlements will vote the
democratic ticket, and it is expected that Ash
and Howe —two x>rominent Ass men—will give
way to Labor members.
As one mode of reforming the “justice”
of the peace system, the election of justices by the
people is certainly consonant with democratic
principles. Also, for the sake of those who grovel
to precedents, it is worth mentioning that the
office was originally an elective one in England—
the country from which Australia borrowed the
J-B.—and remained so until the “commission”
system was established by Edward 111. The
present mode of appointment is, therefore, a
shoddy innovation, and all good, solid Tories who
reverence the mildew of the Past and worship
things that are old should go solid for the policy
of popular election.
Jock M‘lntyre, who is vaguely understood
to be leading the Opposition, has a simple plan for
making the Vic. railways pay. He thinks that
by writing off £10,000,000 of the capital the Com-
missioners could put the business on a sound
basis. The benefit to the country, which has to
pay interest on all the original capital, whether
written off or not, would lie in the immediate
calm satisfaction of believing that =£10,000,000
sterling had been irretrievably lost down the
national sink. This would prepare the public for
a furious outbreak of joy presently when the
Government felt able to credit itself with 2 per
cent, profit on the reconstructed railway capital.
A Bill to abolish public-school fees and
make education absolutely free in N.S.W. was
pushed half - way through the Assembly by
Griffith, M.L.A., during the session " just
ended ; Out Government hostility stopped it
from advancing further. Premier Reid’s objec-
tion is that he can’t afford to lose £50,000
a year net revenue. He already loses about that
amount in subsidising the Sydney papers with free
newspaper postage, and the money would be much
better spent in promoting knowledge than in cir-
culating, at the cost of the State, the latest betting
and the story of the horror that was done in
Woqlloomooloo, and the advt. about the baby to
be disposed of.
Premier Forrest, at Coolgardie :—“Par-
liament will build a railway to Esperance when it
thinks it necessary. I think you had better leave
this matter and ask for things you are likely to
get. . . As far as the Esperance Bay railway
is concerned, I must express myself as entirely
opposed to it. If it is carried out, all the traffic
from the eastern colonies will go by it.” Of
course it would. No one would be likely to pay
for 1000 miles of unnecessary haulage on himself
and his goods merely to keep alive the dismal city
of Perth. Forrest's admission that he objects to
the Esperance Bay line simply because he wants
to drag everybody and everything at great expense
round through his own beastly town for the said
beastly town’s profit, is about the most foolish
statement on record.
His motion in favor of re-establishing
quinquennial parliaments in Kanakaland, so that
the Boodlewraith Government will only have to
dodge the infuriated populace once every five
years instead of every three, has probably sealed
Hamilton s fate in the Cook electorate. That
doughty legislator lias lived long enough on the
reputation of his shooting exploits and fisticuff
encounters, and the electors in his district are
about ready for a change. Riddell, editor of the
Hagle (Ch. lowers), has just been stumping the
district m the interests of Labor with good
prospects.
CALLED BACK.
1- JOHNNIE : “I’m tired of that feller’s stoppin
at the winder ter chin with my sister every
mornin’. ”
2 —MR. RYDER : “Well, good-bye, dear. Business
before pleasure, you know, so I must be off.”
3—And he was off in short order.
The enquiry into the charges of corruption
brought by Lormer, J.P., against the unpaid
magistracy of Melbourne is getting on about as
rapidly as was expected. The Government first
declined to take the matter up in the jjublie in-
terest, and wanted Lormer to support his case
single-handed against all the combined J.P.-dom
of Victoria. Then it offered him the assistance of
Bryan O’Loghlen, the easy-going, genial, hairless
baronet whose constant anxiety not to distress
any influential person makes him about the most
unfit man in Victoria for the business. There
were long delays, in the course of which Lormer
averred that some of his best witnesses were being
shipped off to parts unknown, and in the same
interval several robust libel-actions were started
against Lormer. Finally, the investigation had
one day out last Wednesday, and after one hair-
raising alleged “revelation” supported by three
witnesses, and a flat denial by the J.P. against
whom the charge was made, the proceedings were
adjourned for seven weeks. If the court drives
along at this furious rate, it will certainly run
over somebody.

THE SYDNEY MUSIG HALL— EXTERIOR VIEW.
A NEW MUSIC HALL.
A WELCOME addition to the architecture of Sydney
has just been completed by Mr. John Lawler, upon
the site where stood for many years his vast furnish-
ing warehouse, at 608, 610 and 612 George-street The
buildings are erected on land having a frontage to Georg
street of 50 feet, with a depth of 250 feet along Union Jane
and are two storeys in height. The front is built of red
double-pressed bricks, with ornamental terra-cotta work.
There are two shops, each 60ft. by 16ft., with lofty ceilings
and built-in strong-rooms in each shop, and Nvell-hghtec
offices overhead. The shops, too, are uncommonly well-lighted ,
and the lavatory accommodation is all that could be desiref.
The vestibule, 100ft. by 12ft., leading from George-street
to the Music Hall, is of commanding altitude ; and, hke all
the other divisions of the building, is admirably lighted--
by day by a splendid lantern light; at night by the electric-
light. The offices upstairs, six in number, have an entrance
from Union-lane. { ,
The Music Hall is 90ft. by 42ft., with a height of 30tt.
and has an immense louvred lantern-light in the centre, ihe
o-allery at rear of hall is 30ft. by 42ft., and seats 250 people,
while the whole hall comfortably seats 1000. There are
numerous escape doors, all of which are on the latest ap-
proved principle. The ceiling is of iron, with artistically
moulded iron cornices; the proscenium also is of iron ihe
hall is splendidly ventilated ; and all that the skill of talented
electricians could do has been done with the
which also illuminates the magnificent stage of 30tt by
The dressing-rooms are under the floor of the hall, very
commodious, and perfectly ventilated.
The cloakroom adjoins the manager’s offices upon the
ground floor, off the vestibule. Under the office floor is a
strong-room, built of iron girders and concrete, with a stone
staircase leading from the offices. The whole of the mam
portions of the work was done by day-labor.

A SUCCESSFUL SEASON.
THE Sydney Music Hall was opened on 2nd November last
with, flattering public patronage ; and the excellent com-
pany secured by the proprietor has been playing to large
ever since. The newest attractions have been seemed
rom time to time ; and the unanimous verdict is that for an
entertainment full of laughter and frolic, yet choice and re-
ined, there is nothing in Australia to surpass that provided
oy the Sydney Music Hall.
The accommodation given to visitors has been the sub-
ject of warm commendation. The floor is on a gradual slope,
which permits the most distant spectator m the cheaper part
of the house to secure a complete view of the stage. Above is
a spacious gallery. The acoustic requirements of the hall
have been specially attended to, so that the hearing is almos
perfect. The stage is deep, is supplied with all the most up-
to-date mechanism, and the scenery—which has been specially
painted for it—is in all respects adequate. Everything
indeed about the hall is new. The decorations, the furnishings,
the stage appurtenances, are all of the most complete kind.
The programme is changed weekly, and new faces are
constantly appearing on the platform. The company, now 100
strong, and in its '8th week of success, gives, under the
superintendence of manager W. P. Morrison, a show t >
pleases, amuses, and instructs. The entertainment deludes
Songs, Ballads, Dances, Sketches, Funny Acts, Skirt-Dancing,
High Kicking, Acrobats, &c., &c. ; and a specially strong bill
has been prepared for the Christmas and New ear Jpason.
The Pantomime De Va. ,-ty programme is a wondrous affair.
First-class artists everywhere are invited to communicate
with the proprietor, Mr. John Lawler, 608 George-st., Sydney,
who now on his own behalf and on that of the Sydney Music
Hall Company wishes to friends and patrons everywhere
A HAPPY NEW YEAR.

J. B. Patterson's warlike nephew, George,
has been appointed adjutant, whatever that may
be, to the Vic. Mounted Rides. George Patter-
son, the last time The Bulletin heard of him,
was leading a detachment of rifles to glory in front
of the Governor’s carriage, and if an adjutancy is
anything greater than that he ought to consider
himself a favored mortal. Distinctions in military
rank are more than ever difficult to understand
since Booth started a barmy. An adjutant, at a
salvation meeting, is a fellow who tases sinners
3uite unawares by whispering “ come, do come I”
in their startled ears,

ice Minister Gould is a close churchman and

General Want is said to have a pet Sundav-school

Cardinal Moran has a somewhat Chinese
cast of countenance, and, if fitted with a pig-tail,
would, in his ecclesiastical robes, look not unlike
a Mandarin. Apropos of which this story is told
of a certain English begging ecclesiastic who
lately invaded Australia, and who, as he wielded
a good knife and fork (and perhaps for other
reasons) was not smiled upon by the ascetic
Cardinal. One day the visitor, while in the street
with a friend, saw that gentlemanly • looking
Chinese, the Rev. Soo Huo Ten (Anglican) pa*s
by. “Ah,’’ said the rev. trencherman, nudging
his companion, “ Another of your saintly Austra-
lian prelates, I presume.”
ONLY ONE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Eyes of brown and eyes of blue.
Or inclining gray ward ;
Eyes unchangeable and true,
Fickle eyes and wayward—
All of these I’ve seen, and sighed
Till my shattered heart has died ;
None would droop if I defied.
Lighten at my stray word.
Eyes of brown and eyes of blue
Ne’er would show me favor ;
Hotly though I learned to woo,
Eyes would never waver.
Idle glance was all rny lot,
Lightly given, soon forgot;
Of a sweeter meaning— not
E’en the slightest flavor.
Eyes of brown and eyes of blue
Know no feeling tender ;
W oman's heart is never true,
Woman’s faith is slender.
Yet, did her eyes condescend
One poor glance on me to fiend,
What would be my answer, friend ?
Full and free surrender !
WYVIS.
An indignant deputation from a N.S. VV.
back I 'looks town complained the other day about
a prisoner being employed to paint the gaol-fence,
thereby preventing some freo-oitizen getting a
job, A whole lot of similar deputations have
turned up at different times to complain of cheap
N.S. VV. gaol-made products competing with those
of the cornstalk who is at large; yet N B.W.
votes strongly for a policy under which the pro-
ducts of the tree Chinaman—who is even cheaper
than the imprisoned Australian—and of the Bel-
gian and German convict, come into this country
free, and compete as much as they please. As
evidencing the condition of what the N.S.VV.
citizen evidently supposes to be his mind, this is a
curious state of things.
Dickson, M.L.A. (Q.), wants to have a
bronze statue erected to Gov. Norman. This in-
satiable appetite for erecting statues at other
people’s expense is a disease that wants watching.
Dickson should remember how Gov. Blackall’s
statue at Ipswich hung tire so long as to be a
public aspersion on the dead man’s name. Let
the matter stand over for 50 years ; then Gov.
Norman may be as forgotten as Dickson himself!
If be isn’t, then erect the statue.
A Northern P.M. telis a story about a
young nigger who, once came to him to borrow a
spade lor the purpose of burying his aged pa.
.the magistrate complied with the reqm st ami
accompanied him back to thecamp to see the dead
parent—who was laid out on the ground, wrapped
up in ti-tree bark, and bound round with vines.
Ibe P.M. was horrified to see the supposedly-dead
man open and shut his eyes, and said to the dusky
son, “ Why, he’s not dead—l just saw him open
his eyes.” “Oh, yes, he dead,” exclaimed the
affectionate young nigger, “ he only gammon !”
Sergeant-Major Baker, late of the Vic.
Permanent Artillery, charged with an extensive
senes of swindles (his alleged method was borrow-
ing many sums ot money simultaneously), was a
nephew of Valentine Baker (Pasha), whose esca-
pade with JVliss Dickenson in an English railway-
carriage is historic. The offences imputed to the
Vic. absconder somewhat recall the case of a very
smart Sydney trader, who, many years ago,
scooped in a lot of cash by somewhat similar
methods before scooting to' ’Frisco. Amongst
other things, he sold his buggy to a priest, and,
having gut paid, borrowed the trap from Ins rever-
ence “ for the day ” —afterwards proceeding to sell
it to and borrow it “for theday ” from a multitude
of other confiding persons. Ue got off clear with
or <£7ooo there was then no M.L. cable
and, after living in San Francisco for many years,
he unsuccessfully tried on a similar trick there
lately.
A reported opinion of George Black, M.P.
(N.S.W.): “There will never be any solution of
the ‘unemployed’ difficulty until the day of
universal brotherhood ’’: —
“Universal brotherhood”
Cannot yet be understood,
And the sound of its expression somewhat flat Is J
For the “ Brotherhood of He”
Means the “ Sisterhood of She ”
Pause, and think a bit, dear boy, how far off that Ist
The Argus, in a burst of particular in-
sanity :
It is sufficient (o say that there is a growing sentiment
all the world over that everything is not attained by
giving one man one vote and by doing nothing more.
The world is progressing from that stage, and in a colony
there is a special reason for this development.
Can the Tory paper name any part of the world
which has discarded the one-man-one-vote prin-
ciple after having once adopted it, or mention any
“colony” where a new faith in plural-proputty
votes has lately started to grow ?

down a series of “ Resolutions ” for
1896.
Every man does so, as it’s the
correct way to begin the New Year,
whether he succeeds in keeping
them or not.
One Resolution
You Can Keep
may come in handy.
If you are a millionaire, pass on,
as it’s quite immaterial to you
whether you pay a guinea for a
fifteen-shilling article.
This is for the eye
of the man who has no chance of
marrying Vanderbilt’s daughter.
I Resolve
during 1896 to follow the example
of my wife, who assures me that
whatever she requires in the way of
LACES, RIBBONS,
DRESS FABRICS,
COSTUMES, CORSETS,
UNDERWEAR,
MILLINERY,
BOOTS and SHOES,
CHILDREN’S DRESSES,
FURNITURE,
DRESS TRIMMINGS,
PERFUMERY,
etc., etc.,
She finds it at
Mark Foy’s
in the greatest abundance ; in the
most fashionable style, shape, make,
or cut; in the newest or freshest
materials; and at prices which
represent a saving of from four
shillings (as a general thing) to
ten shillings (occasionally) in the
pound. And as
My Wife Knows
A THING OR TWO,
the man who can please her in
these things can please me in
BOOTS, SHOES and SOX,

German J.P., to pri-oner : “You vare (tronk. I
Seen you mi beset f. Vourtli'vii days, mitondt '>rp-
tum, Mow you blend—guildy or not guildy? ’
The scenery of the Otira Gorge (M.L.)
ranks among the grandest in the world. Some
one said to Arthur Davis, an old coach-driver :
“ You must have heard a great many remarks
upon the scenery in your time. What have you
found to be the general opinion of English
tourists?’’ Davis meditated for a few seconds,
debating evidently how best to summarise the
various dicta he had heard. Then he took his
pipe from his mouth and said : “ Well, the general
opinion seems to be ‘Bai Jove.’” The same
driver once had beside him on the box a very
nervous man who for hours plagued him witli
anxious enquiries such as; “Is it very much
worse going down Porter’s Pass than coming up.
D> you think I shall be very frightened? Would
you advise me to go inside?-” Davis bluffly
assured him that it would be “ All right.” When
the Coach was a few hundred yards from the point
where the descent begins, he leaned over to Ids
companion and, speaking in a low voice, said :
“ I don’t want you to say anything for fear of
frightening the other passengers, but I’m just a
bit afraid of my front wheel. I want you (con-
fidentially) to keep a close watch on it and tell me
if it shows any sign of coming loose.” Now, had
there been the least thing wrong with the wheel
any idea of descending the pass would have been
out of the question, for the road is cut out of the
aide of the mountain, so that on the inner side is
the face of the cutting, on the other a precipitous
fall of hundreds of feet to the bottom of the
valley. But the nervous passenger thought only
of the commission with which he had been
charged, and kept his eyes riveted to the axle of
the suspected wheel. In about 20 minutes the
coach rattled through a small river, and a moment
or so afterwards came to a stop. The passenger
gave a sigh of relief and turned to the driver ;
“The wheel seems all right,” he said. “ And
what about the Pass? ” The other turned quickly
and gazed hack in the direction from which the
coach had come. Yes, there was the road like a
clay-colored thread laid along the face of the
mountain. “And we have come down there?”
he asked incredulously. Davis nodded. Then he
laughed. “I told yon it would be all right,” he
said. “But,” said the other with only partial
comprehension, “ the wheel . . “ Ob, that
was all right, too ! ”

The stone at the Golden Surprise, Charters
Tpwere, was at latest reports the best being raised on that
field. This looks like becoming a valuable property, but
the ‘ 1 Surprise ” corner of the Towers field has hitherto been
notorious mostly for its patchiness. Some dabs were
got from time to time on or near the surface. At only a
moderate depth the reefs and hopes of the shareholders
alike disappeared.
* » * *
,The Victoria and Caledonia Block, Charters
Towers, has been in the shade for some years. Formerly
the old Just-in-Time, it turned out some big averages.
It is popularly supposed to be a block on the Victoria
reef, from which such handsome returns have been
obtained. Sinking to catch that reef at a depth, they
either missed it or passed through a blank, or something.
The reef worked in Craven’s Caledonia also runs into the
Victoria and Caledonia Block ground, and is its stand-by.
Recently a party of tributors obtained over 90oz. from
47 tons 17 cwt. of stone taken from Craven’s reef, in the
V. and C. Block ground.
• * * •
Charters Towers dividends for November,
£18,803 14s. Bd. Calls, £7400. Dividends for 11 months
within a trifle of £230,000. It is probable the year will
end with a quarter of a million.
* * • «
’"’ At the start of the Auckland (M.L.) mining-
boom, a number of men—several of whom had been em-
ployed in the Hauraki—took up a piece of ground peg-
and-peg with that big gold-producer. They called it
Bunker’s Hill, floated it, and in a week scrip stood at ss.
A shaft was sunk with the idea of cutting Legge’s leader,
supposed to run from the Hauraki into Bunker’s. After
getting down a certain depth and driving some distance
the manager wired that a leader had been struck,
and forwarded a parcel of very massive and rich
specimens, which were proudly displayed in a huge
wash - basin at the exchange. The shares began to
jump, and soon touched 18s. 9d. Shortly after, rumors
went round that the mine-manager and the legal manager
had parted with large parcels of shares. The public
began to buzz, when the manager affirmed he had not
struck Legge’s at all, and begged to be allowed to drive
another 20 or 30ft. so as to reach the jeweller’s shop.
Meantime the scrip came down with a run. A crushing
was proceeded with, but only turned out 85oz. Then the
directors (shares being now 45.) met and sacked the
manager ; two dissenting directors immediately resigned.
Of no other new mine was so much expected for a time,
and the crash has had a most damaging effect on all the
smaller Coromandel stocks. Bunker’s big neighbor
(Hauraki), for the month ending 14th Dec., produced
£7206 worth of gold from 246 tons.
» * * »
The Waihi, Upper Thames (M.L.). is a progres-
sive mine. Bullion to the value of £337,042 has been
obtained since ’9O, the annual returns being as follows :
1890, £20,930; 1891, £23,934; 1892, £44,883 ; 1893, £61,895;
1894, £82,820; 1895 (eleven months), £102,580. Average
value of ore per ton, £3 ss. 6d.
A bit of the mine’s inner history. Some years
ago, worked by ordinary battery process, it dragged out a
miserable existence. The stuff realised less than £1 per
ton, but—a large heap of tailings had accumulated. In
those dark ages scientific treatment was unknown on the
Thames, but eventually the Cassel Co.’s expert came along
and aroused the sleeping beauty. Cassel’s man assayed
the tailings, lay low, finally bought the lot for £5OOO, put
up a large cyanide plant, and netted £20,000 clear. The
local people woke up ; got more capital, and cyanided
night and day. Which accounts for the milk in the Waihi
cocoa-nut.

For publishing at Hobart a prickly little print
called Actual Facts without having entered into recog-

ordered in default of payment to be imprisoned “ until

for life.

Slowbart people do not take kindly to income-
tax. One citizen whose return was sent back to him for
fuller details re some bad debts, enumerated therein as a
set-off against total receipts, was exceeding wroth on
receiving it. Ordinary language failed him, and he wrote
opposite the items specially mentioned as requiring
explanation, the following crisp information ; “ Skedad-
dled ; d—d thief.” “ Cut his throat ” (true). “ Civil-
servant, d d rogue,” &c. Later on, his case was heard
in Chambers, and the presiding Judge pointed to the
fact that his expressions were totally unfitted to the
occasion. The “ individual ” said that the income-tax
officials had practically called him a liar, and he, in his
anger, could command no parts of speech but nouns,
adjectives and verbs. However, he got through with his
appeal.

O’Blank was a mining inspector, appointed
because he had “ friends” and possessed of an insatiable
desire to lord it over the miners among whom he had

His first visit was to the Homeward Bound, where Dan
M’Lean and mates were working on a three-foot reef of
brown stone. Dan smiled as he saw the new inspector
floundering down the underlie. O'Blank saw that smile,
and vowed vengeance. “ Look here, chaps,” he gasped
after he had got his breath, “ you’ll have to be mighty
careful now ; Fm not going to let miners be killed by your
infernal carelessness. See that flake of granite up there—
that’ll have to come down.” M’Lean smiled again.
“And,” continued O’Blank, “this piece of work at the
head of the drive’ll have to come down.” Still Daniel
smiled serenely and nodded his head. “ And—oh ! d
me,” exclaimed Mr. O’Blank in a towering rage, generated
and fanned by that quiet smile of Dan’s, “ that there long
ledge will have to come down too, or, d me, I’ll have
ye all up for negligence in contravention of the Act in
such cases made and provided. That there ledge’ll have
to come down, d’ye hear?” “Yes,” replied Dan in his
quietest and most conciliatory tone, “ that ledge will have
to come down right enough. That’s the reef.”

Time the various Eastern Marine Boards took
action to prevent the disgraceful overcrowding of
steamers bound West. Passengers are packed closer than
the proverbial herring, in berths hastily rushed together
’tween decks, while the sanitary arrangements are at
times too awful for description." And yet, under these
circumstances, the shipping co’s have the gall to ask the
public to inspect this "or that ship’s splendid accommoda-
tion. But, of course, one cannot expect too much from
Marine Boards, seeing they are principally controlled by
shipowners.

One of the most amazing of the many Vic. boom
publications was a voluminous compilation styled “ The
Jubilee History of Victoria and Melbourne.” Looked
through now it is found to be filled with advertising puffs
of all the most crooked men and institutions that made
the period stink with their putrescence—all the gaoled,
suicided or absconded prisoners, all the cronk, gone-bung
financial snares, are arrayed in the book, and be-slavered
with slimy laudation. And this very compilation holds
honorable place in Melbourne National and every Mel-

Prohibition seems to have done something for

But the prohibitive calamity is never likely to repeat that
stroke of luck. No one will ever strike a gold-mine while
searching for gingerbeer.

Dear Bulletin, —Is there any money in the
country? I lately struck a town on the N.W. coast of
N.S.W. that for scarcity of coin can give a long start to
any busted bank or venerable statesman. There is
nothing else remarkable about it - it has the old-time pub.
with a barn-stable, the blacksmith’s shop, the combined
store and post-office, and the always-new-looking gal-
vanised-iron-dancing-shed spread along the hard, blue-
metalled road. But all the while I was there—and
when I left—l didn’t see a coin change hands. Two
or more busbies enter the bar (no “ Jimmy Woodsers ” up
there) have their whisky or rum (you leave the “ colonial”
district when you pass Newcastle) and pass out. Landlord
chalks it up. “All good marks ?” I asked. “Yes; but
they have a limit. Then I go round and buy their pigs
and corn, and wipe off the account. You see, up here
they’ve only got to pay the interest, the flour-bill and the
grog-score, out of the corn ; the old woman buys every-
thing else out of the poultry. When a fellow comes here
at all, he stops for the day, so I ring in a couple of stiff
’uns and then”—he held the whisky bottle under the
water-tap—“towards the last they are drinking water,
and it’s funny to see them break it down out of the filter.”
I went along to the store. Every customer Carried eggs,
fowls, beeswax,-hides, or horse-hair—and took the amount
out in groceries, &c. Youngsters brought a couple of
eggs each—“ Please, for some lollies!” But the climax
was reached by a bare-legged, middle-aged, frowsy-headed
child with a letter—“ Please, put a stamp on this, and
mother’ll send the eggs when the hens lay them.” —Ponte.

Dear Bulletin, —Be the much-worried miner
and the coming N.S.W. conference. This latter is an im-
provement on the “ Rabbit Conference,” The members
for the district nominated the recipients of free-passes and
sleeping-berths for the bunny conventicle. There were
no experts called. The miners (estimated by you at about
one-tenth of the fields) are electing a representative for
each so-called field : but it is only the claim-holder who
gets a show of election. How about a field such as
Bywong?. Where the ground is all private property, the
claim-holder is not the miner. He is generally a holder
for sale and wishes to be allowed to remain so provided he
gets a tenure. Our delegate is secretary of the Progress
ommittee : and he is director of a co. applying for leases,
etc, : also, he is an applicant and mate of an applicant for
other leases. Now, allowing his rectitude and capability
to be incontestible, is he the man to represent those who
are debarred from claims by cliques, which, though they
have not yet got all the reefs, have first applications in
for the best of them ? I have asked the Mines Dept, to be
allowed to put this forward at the conference, being
self-elected, simply because the disappointed miners
cannot hold or attend a meeting. If there were any
labor conditions here, there would be employment for at
least 200 wandering miners.—Pmu Mowbray, Bywong.

Said a man from the Bahamas to a Bulletin
man the other day “ The artificial manufacture of
pearls by natural means is quite easy if you only know
the way. Introduce a small piece of grit into a pearl-
oyster, and in one or two years you may get a pearl. But
I know the wrinkle whereby you can get a pearl every
time. You know that ‘Southern Cross pearl’ that is
valued at £20,000? Well, from what I know of the arti-
ficial construction of pearls, I think it is quite likely to be
a fake -perhaps not an intentional one. You know those
little lead crosses in children’s lolly packets ? Well, using
one of these as a base, I just missed making a ‘ Southern
Cross No. 2’pearl. One end of the darned thing has no
deposit on it; that was all. I know a Chinaman who has
a lot of little leaden got Is perfectly covered with pearl.”

A Melbourne business incident. A person, say
Smith, had a good business, but was not satisfied and
hungered for the connection of a big rival. He knew
Brown, the manager of the latter. The manager held a
big connection on his own account, and is one of the
cleverest men in his line in Australia; also, he had
money, said cash being invested in certain bank shares
carrying a supposed very remote liability. He listened
to Smith and saw that the offer of a half partnership in
his business for £3OOO was a good thing and cheap. The
bank being considered sound, shares to value of £3OOO
were handed over. Matters went on swimmingly for the
new partnership, and Brown’s old firm felt the ground
slipping from under it, and commenced to view affairs
seriously. One morning, however, the bank did not take
its shutters down, and never will again. The bank’s
liquidator then worried Smith and Brown for calls. Re-
sult ; Smith and Brown are now roaming the earth in
broken boots looking for jobs, whilst the latter’s old em-
ployers have bought their busted rivals’ business for a
song from the liquidator of the defunct bank, and are
serene and happy.

Vic. softgoods people speak of this season’s
trade as the soundest for the past four years. Last sum-
mer most of the Lane firms dropped heavily over several
big retailers who went wrong, but now the weak ones are
wiped out they are again making substantial profits. One
of the principal houses has only made three bad debts
this half-year, and the average all round is on a similar
low percentage.
SPOUTING NOTIONS .
The result of the two scratch races in which
Zimmerman was beaten at Melbourne, last Saturday, by
Pither (M.L.) and Walker (Vic.), respectively, made a
sensation. In the Invitation Mile, Pither challenged the
field in the fourth lap, and got away 20 yards ; 100 yards
from home Zimmerman caught him, but Pither came
again and won by a length, amid great excitemens.
In the other race, the One - mile International,
after Zim. had led from the start, Martin
bolted in the third lap and got away 50yds. When
Zim, started after him Walker hung on to A.A.Z.,
whom he beat on the post by a few inches. Zim. said he
never thought anybody here could have stuck to his
wheel in such a sprint. During the afternoon Zim., paced
by a triplet, cut out half-a-mile from a flying start in
58sec., thus lowering the Australian record of Imin
2 l-ssec.

Young Harris, the biker from England, blames
Melbourne’s variable climate for his moderate displays
thus tar. Can’t get into form, he says. Harris is under
suspicion of having lost some of his form through a fall,
before coming to this country. Didn’t he fracture a lot
of ribs, or break his neck, or something ?

Parsons’ crack performance to date, which even
eclipses his 28 l-sth secs, lap on the M.C.G. grass track,
is the mile he threw behind him at Melb. Exhibition, last
week, in 2m. 2 4-sth secs., or 6 secs, less than “Bob”
Lewis’s previous best Australian record. Considering
that this was put up on a five-lap, sharp-cornered,
irregular-banked track, which Zim., on his first arrival
in Melbourne, pronounced capable of recording a mile
in 2.10, but no less, the performance must rank with the
world’s best. Leaving out the Yankee alleged records
on straight tracks, most of which are done with a first-
class blizzard in the rear, the recognised times of the mile
are—(England) Harris, 1.58; and (America) Johnson,
1.53. The great Zim. has so far failed to cut the time
below 1.57, and Parsons’ last week’s performance certainly
looks equal to either Harris’s or Zim.’s, when the condi-
tion of the English and American tracks is considered.
* » * ♦
It is by no means a settled thing that Parsons
goes to America with Zimmerman.

M‘G : “ Paul Mell ” is very wise after the
Austral event. When he says that the placed men in the
Austral final were too generously handicapped he talks a
truism which was apparent to everybody on the ground
ssecs. before the pistol went—but not previously. The fact
must be recognised that perfect handicapping is impossible,
or we would be having every competitor finishing abreast
as in an Argus man’s sketch. The handicapping of the
Austral of ’95 is.as good as could be wished. The fact that
the back men had no possible chance in the final lay, not
in the starts allotted, but in the fact that a huge gap
of 60yds. was left them to make up. The fact of the
matter regarding Crisp is that nobody, not even excep-
ting himself, was aware, or, in the writer’s opinion,
is yet aware, what • a flyer he is. The boy came
over from Tasmania with hardly a race to his credit,
and, considering what the handicappers knew about
him, he was not at all well treated by being placed
on the 255. Of course, he has turned out a tcmpicide
(copyright) and the race falls easily to him how easily no
one will ever know. By the way, Paul Mell’s cycling
history is a bit “ off.” He gravely asserts that “Crisp’s
time is the shortest (of any Austral winner) but then his
start was the longest.” This is incorrect. Woodward,
the ’93 Austral winner, scooped the £2OO from the 270yds.,
as against Crisp’s 255, and when it is considered that the
former’s start was from Don Walker and Arthur Turner
on scratch, while Crisp’s, though nominally from Zimmer-
man, was really from Parsons, Pither, etc., his 255 must
be reduced by another 60yds.

Cycling being essentially amateur in M.L., few
cracks of note are found in the professional domain.

The high-gear cyclists—Martin and Porta, for
instance - are clumsy performers individually, but for
show purposes they have a distinct value. The contrast
between the high-gear workers and “pretty pedallers”

“M.” writes: “After M'Kibbin’s recent bad
performance - five wickets for 183, against an inferior
batting team like Queensland—he will have to work
wonders with the ball in order to sail with the Australian
Eleven. The following would be as good an eleven as
any :-G. Giffen, Darling, C. Hill (S.A.), H. Trott (capt.),
A. E. Trott, Graham, Lewis, Bruce (Vic.), Gregory,
Donnan, Turner, Iredale (N.S.W.), Coningham (Q.), or
Eady (Tas.).” Giffen will please smile here.
• « • •
Percy M‘Donnell reckons there is at present
only one first-class bowler in Australia—Turner ; but he
is not the Terror of yore. The next Australian Eleven, in
M'Donnell’s estimation, will be very weak in bowling and
not over good in .fielding; in batting, it will be strong.
“ George Giffen is the best all-round Australian cricketer,
but would make a very bad captain.” Donnan, in his
opinion, should be included as “ a game, good batsman, a
good field, and good change bowler, and a perfectly
steady man,” who won’t decorate the tour with any glit-
tering “ bursts.”
M'Donnell says that the drawbacks to Brisbane
cricket are want of enthusiasm due to the conviction that
no Brisbaneite can be good enough for the Australian
Eleven; practice wickets so badly kept that batting on
them does a man more harm than good ; and the bad
light and bad wickets of the Brisbane Association and
Exhibition grounds. The success of English and Aus-
tralian batting is due, he thinks, not to improved batting,
but to deterioration in bowling. Australia has no Spof-
forth or “ Terror” Turner now, and England has no such
bowling trio as Shaw, Morley, and Steel.

Blackham should be ticked off at once as an
“ impossible ” manager for next Australian Eleven. “ Old
Jack ” is a rabid cricket enthusiast, who would be incap-
able of tearing his thoughts away from an interesting
game. A smart, smooth, unemotional business man,
with the tact to keep the team in good fellowship, and
the business experience necessary to a money-seeking
show is what they want. Another objection to Black-
ham, or any other old ex-member of the Eleven : As a
diplomat he is a proved failure. Former teams have not
been happy families under his captaincy. Harry Mus-
grove should be the man to take charge of the next Aus-
tralian Eleven, and bring them back in a good temper,
with a good record, and a good big bag of boodle.

The cricket-match, Queensland Graziers Meat
Export Co. v. N,S.W. Northern Districts was a lively

The N.S.W. Cricket Association promised
Coningham his expenses if he would come to Sydney and

Turner stands out of the N.S.W. team going
to Melbourne and Adelaide to play in the Interprovincial
matches. It is only fair to /ay that Turner could not do
himself justice at present owing to business exigencies.
And did he play, and play badly, it might spoil his show
for the next Aus. Eleven.

G. Giffen, W. Bruce, and A. Bannerman will,
it is confidently said, pick the next Australian Eleven
Business may stop Bruce’s going, but A. Bannerman will
do his utmost to get nominated.
George Giffen is a doubtful starter for the Aus-
tralian Eleven. The reason, he gives is the retirement of
Mostyn Evan from his candidature for the managership,
but some Adelaideans who understand the, workings of
the great man’s mind fancy he is backing out because
Harry Trott is such a strong tip for the captaincy.
If the South Australian cricket public had to
elect the captain of the Australian eleven, Harry Trott
would head the poll, with Giffen nowhere.

Not long ago a certain Southern horse-owner, or
pony-owner—no matter which was in the habit of
placing his “stiff’uns” in the hands of a certain book-
maker, who laid agin ’em to the modest amount ordered,
and also, as a matter of course, laid a bit extra for the
benefit of his bloomin’ self, d’yersee. This bookmaker
used to instruct a second Ikey, who, equally of course,
laid a bit for Tsself, and so the game went pleasantly
on. A stiff ’un isn’t good for very much money
at small suburban meetings. The betting on the
corpse opens at 6 to 4 maybe, and quickly
lengthens, and by the time £4O has been extracted
from its decomposing remains the backers smell a bad
smell and retire with curses on their lips. One day the
horse or pony-owner aforesaid handed in his animal for
treatment as per usual, and the corpse looked exception-
ally fresh and juicy. So the first bookmaker decided to
get a lot extra for hisself, also the second Ikey thought he
saw a fine chance to do likewise, and somehow the backers
stuck to their foolish fancy with unprecedented vigor.
The dead ’un won that day. The owner was debited with
the modest amount he had ordered his confidential agent
to lay. On the other hand, he was credited through his
backing commissioners with the few hundreds won from
the two bookmaker biters who had been bitten. This is
what is called a sporting story.

Backing a fashionable jockey’s mounts is one of

The enquiry made by the Vic. Railway Com-
missioners into the charge against the booking-clerks at
Spencer-street, of keeping back change when ticket-selling
during Cup-week, proves, so far as it has yet gone, to be
rather a low-down affair. It transpires that the complaints
made came, in some cases at all events, from V.R.C.
private detectives, who admitted having left their change
behind, and tailed to return for it when called back. The
idea was to ascertain whether the clerks stuck to any
surplus cash. As most of them, however, did account for
the surplus, there doesn’t seem to be much in the affair.

That fine mare, Mystery, tried to break the
Australian mile record at Moonee Valley (Vic.) recent
trotting meeting. She started off at a great bat, and was
going strongly when a thorn punctured one of the pneu-
matic tyres of the sulky. In spite of the delay which
this caused her, she just equalled the previous record,
2.25. She made two other attempts during the afternoon,
but the first go had evidently taken a lot out of her, as
she got worse instead of better. Her owner intends to
have another try next meeting, and, as his private trial
was 2.19, the odds seem to be on the record going
kersmash very soon.

Writes “Scrip”: A noticeable feature of the
Sydney Xmas handicaps this year is the lack of pre-
liminary interest usually manifested, and the meagre
character of the early betting. The Summer Cup run-
ning should furnish a fair forecast of the probable result of
Tatt.’s Cup, though the latter is a quarter of a mile
longer. For the first-named event Mahee, who has been
lying fallow for some time, appears to have an -undoubted
chance, if not saved for the longer race. Courallie may,
at one of the meetings, contradict the impression that he
is not a stayer. He ran well in Nobleman’s Metrop.,
which was fast considering the ground. Woodford is
reckoned to have an outside show, and so is Te Whiti, but
the light-weighted Fort should hold the pair safe in either
cup. Distance appears to be to his liking, as witness his
good run behind Quiver in the three-mile race in the
Spring. The Trier may bid for Tatt.’s Cup, but doesn’t
appear to have a rosy chance. The most dangerous pair
in both events are Mahee and Fort.
December Stakes should provide a clipping
contest. Reward, Huret, Le Var, and Mosaic appear
likely to monopolise the betting, but it’s on the cards that
a surprise will be sprung by Amnabah, who has a few
places to his credit, and is coming on.
One might pick half-a-dozen, and then fail to
spot the winner of Carington Stakes, which is likely to
furnish a big field. Courallie, Blue Cap, and Response
appear to have undeniable chances, while the well-bred
Collarette should have more than a good outside-show of
bringing off a long-shot.

Mr. T. J. CLUNE,
of Walkerville, S. Australia, "writes:
“Six years ago, I had an attack of Indiges-
tion and Liver Complaint that lasted for
weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, food distressed me, and I
suffered much from headache. My skin was
&
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. I tried
several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of
mv customers recommended Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla; it helped me from the first,—in fact,
after taking six bottles 1 was completely
cured, and could eat anything and sleep like
,a child.”
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla

Dear Bulletin, —Dr. Johnson and the

law, jam publica unteferenda privatis, has been
universally accepted Ly modern jurists, one of the
most eminent of whom puts it that “ the com-
munity has a paramount claim —irrespective of
any collateral circumstances whatever—upon the
individual’s decision between any two lines of
conduct.” And, since it is only in the assumed
ultimate interests of the community that a special
professional reticence is permitted to the lawyer,
it would certainly seem that, when the lawyer
himself believes silence will be detrimental to
those interests, his duty is to break it.— SUMMUM

The evolution of N.S.W, Land theories
has so far proceeded thus : For many years—fully
40—tracts of land were given away as favors, as
bribes, or as rewards. Then succeeded, by a
decree of the Imperial Government, a system of
sale, with a minimum price of ss. per acre. This
was followed some eight years after by another
decree fixing the price per acre at 125,, and this
again by an Imperial Act raising the amount to
j£l. Having parted with the land, the next
development was the study of means to tax some
of it back. This study culminated in the Dibbs-
Jennings proposal of £d. tax with ,£lOOO exemp-
tions, which was rejected. Parkes-Bnrns followed
with the same scheme and £5OO exemption, w hich
died stillborn; and then came Reid with Id. tax
and .£475 exemption, which being conferenced
down to is to go on the statute-book.

And work up a most illigant ruction

Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
Genera! Debility of the Nervous' System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both_ in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaliiie Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies’
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,

this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to tho Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Su livan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus JOB,
and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

‘ ‘ Later in the afternoon an attempt was made
to induce a jockey to ride a favorite ‘stiff’ for £2O,
but the jockey immediately threatened the offender
that he would be reported.”- (Melb. paper). The public
ought to be able to form a notion of the sort of ‘ sport ’
they may expect at petty suburban race-meetings when
£2O is the “ insult ” offered to the boy who steers the
the favorite.
• • • •
At Sandown (Melb.), the other afternoon,
‘ books ’’ refused to pay over one race (the last on the
card) until they had held a meeting in Melb. to discuss
the “ swindle.” The alleged swindle lay in the fact that
the winner was a warm favorite at 3 to 1 on, and they had
been somehow led to suppose it would get beaten.

For the New Year’s Day meeting at Flemington
there is a good enough programme, and the “double”—
Standish Plate and Bagot Handicap—seems to have a
little of its old-time interest left for some people. But, to
The Bulletin’s way of thinking, a “double” on these
races is an unusually bad investment at the prices offered.
The Bagot seems to be confined to a very few good paper-
chances, and several of the others ought not to have a
“ possible.” The more reason for expecting something
unexpected to turn up in the betting at the post, and win
the race. Among those that should go very near it, if
going at all, Palo Alto is the most likely to win in any sort
of weather.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
The V.R.C. chairman called upon Premier
Turner, the other day, and put the club’s side of the
question, re opening Flemington race-course to the public on
Sundays, in a favorable light. The trouble is that Sun-
day visitors leave broken bottles on the track, and other-
wise behave like embittered punters who bear a grudge
against the property.

The short-sighted punting throng ruthlessly
dismissed the well-bred Fort from their calculations in
December Stakes on Saturday, and he landed a 10 to 1
shot, after completely clipping his field in the last fur-
long. Ensign’s relative is a well-built, dashing pacer, and
promises to ere long figure in the first flight.

W. R. Wilson has made a substantial profit over

Dan Creedon (Vie.) v. Jim Smith (Eng.), stakes,
£4OO ; rounds, t wenty ! Cable liar calls this a boxing-
match. Same way he’d call a Chinese play a play, whereas
it’s a funeral. The British fighting lion must have become
a very domesticated ass to stand this sort of farce being
foisted on his public. No two men can box in the real
sense more than eight rounds. Creedon should win,
unless the man who gets to work first is counted out by
the referee. Concerning the number of rounds ; what an
°*'S'y of butchery, blood and battery was crammed into
the Seale-Sandall slaughter ! And the last four rounds
Seale spent half the time on the floor. Dooley says two
willing men can box but four or five rounds.

Yankee papers use powerful language about
Fitzsimmons. One editor says the “ bluffing, red-headed,
lanky, water-crossed cornstalk” is frightened to meet
Corbett. At Hot Springs (Arkansas), the pair were
ordered by the court not to fight, whereat “ Fitz. seemed
much relieved.” What Corbett “seemed” is not stated
Subsequently, the pair dined at the Capitol Hotel, where
the champion poked his finger in his opponent’s face,
being dragged back per the coat-tail by his manager.
“ coofiy went on eating his apple-pie.” The sheriff
told them in the pub. that, if they plugged in his county,
he’d shoot ’em on sight.
The proposal for a battle at dead of night for no
purse worth speaking about, simply to settle the feud,
wasn’t adopted. Corbett said he was agreeable, but that
was after he’d heard Fitz. wasn’t. The charm of the
championship is the barracking thousands and the rich
purse, which lends metallic lustre to the show.
One ’Murkan speculator has been following the
gladiators for months, in order to reproduce their fight in
kinetoscope form, with some kind of a telephone arrange-
ment to chronicle the remarks of the seconds and fighters
during “ time.”

On the 31st. Oct. that lanky blacksmith from
Timaru (M.L.), always dubbed “Fitzsimmons of Aus-
tralia,” came into £5OO as forfeit from the Florida Athletic
Club. He held the dollars just 22 seconds-a whole sheaf
of attachments gobbled ’em up before he could slake his
thirst with one of ’em.

The Boston Traveller gives quite a different
account of “ Poor Griffo ” ; “ He is in durance vile a<>ain,
having been handed over to the authorities by Harry
Donald, of R. Harnett and Co. Donald went on the
second bond which gave Griffo his liberty pending the
t rial of the charges against him. Griffo was just getting
ready preparatory to going into the country to prepare
for his 10-round contest against George Dixon, when he
was “ pinched.” Griffo’s “ manager ” claims Donald gave
Griffo up because the latter would not be managed by
Donald and his associates. In turn, Donald says Griffo is
a much-abused boy, and that he is badly handicapped by
the people who are managing him. I don’t know who
Donald is, but he tells the truth. There never was a
boxer in the world so miserably managed and treated as
Griffo. He is to be pitied. Isn’t it about time for the
leeches to let go their hold ? ”

It is cabled from America that Fitzsimmons
an-» p-ter Maher are to bash and disfigure each other on
Feb. 14.

Placke’s trouble after his fight with Barker was
the second of the same brand. He put in three weeks of
semi-unconsciousness after a fight in M.L. When the
vast Dutchman first came to Sydney he wanted to take
Dooley on, at least so it is alleged. What Placke could
really do before he met Barker no one seemed to really
know, for he would never give a taste of his quality.
♦ • • •
Corbett did a wise thing in handing the world’s
championship over to Maher, the Irishman, for keeping a
championship or pretending to keep it ends up with the
holder some day becoming nobody. And Yankeeland,
like other places, has no room for the played-out.

Small fry bookmakers and spielers turned out
strongly for the Upper Yarra Regatta, the south bank
being thick with layers of odds. But rowing-men are a
tough lot to deal with, and don’t work hard at the oar
every night for nothing. A backer laid £1 to 10s. on one
event, and when he won went up to collect. He was
handed his pound back and told to consider himself
lucky. After much bad language he left, to return with
a few hairy, hatless, and bootless oarsmen, who proceeded
to maqfully stoush the “book” and his supporters
Connoisseurs describe it as the most breezy fight seen on
the Yarra bank for many months. As many as eight
hot, fat bookihakers, ten spielers, two pickpockets,
eight oarsmen, and six casual strangers were plugging at
one and the same time. Several spielers were thrown
overboard, and sundry “bookies” were turned upside-
down, and the loose coppers shaken out of them, and 10
hats were in the river at once. Finally the books were
routed, with much nose-blood, and after that the moral
atmosphere cleared considerably,

Ed. Bulletin.— The Sydney Mail’s Xmas
supplement purports to depict a camel-loading
scene out West. The artist shows a man using a
double rope as a guiding-rein. Now, no such
thing is m use. One nostril—usually the left—is
punctured, and through this is thrust from the
inside a round bit of wood with a button at one
6 ir lls button keeps the piece of wood from
pulling out when the string attached to the other
end is pulled on. The rein is usually a small
sized whip-cord, as there is no need for any great
force. By the way, why is it that many Bulletin
artists, in depicting a swagman’s camp, show the
billy swung on a pole supported on two forked
sticks ? No genuine bush swaggy ever uses such
a contrivance. He puts the billy right down on
the coals. — Been There.
Lord and Lady Brassey’s lawn-picnic to
6000 Melb. upper-form scholars was not the un-
mitigated success that gushing reporters of both
sexes picture, but this was no fault of their Excel-
lencies. The trouble arose from the fact that the
gigantic piles of provisions were mown down early
m the day ere many of the small boys had had a
look-in. The managers made the mistake of turn-
ing the girls loose upon the provender first, and
when the girls were through nothing remained but
grease-spots and a great vacancy ; consequently, a
couple of thousands of empty boys were left roam-
Xl u? y ice " re o a l lawn, looking wolfish and abom-
ably disloyal. His Ex. offered a shilling a-head
for the boys to go into the city, and get something
to eat if anything edible remained in Melbourne,
which than t seem likely, but the teachers wouldn’t
hear of it. At future events of the kind, Gov.
Brassey will know better than to give the girls
first show at the comestibles. Boys at a picnic
make a great clatter over the food, and seem to be
absorbing great masses at lightning speed, but the
girls settle down to business gravely, in a business-
like way, and, as any experienced caterer knows,
get away with about 30 per cent, more provender
in a given time.

“He Hadn’t Got No Money.”
TOLD BY JIM BROWN, WHO FOUND HIM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ A man, name unknown, cut his throat at Coolgarciie
yesterday, the reason assigned being that he had no
money .‘'—Telegram in daily paper.
But why’d he go and do it, they asked in the Die
Hard bar,
“Why, man, he’d fought right round the north
from Eurowingabar, ~
He blued his watch on Jimbuc, on Dundrum sold
his moke,
And though he held some dollars might just as
well bin broke.
He faced the old Red Ridges, beyond Wyanna-
beeld, _ ,
With thirteen hundred miles to do before he
touched the field.
Three times for want of water his tongue hung
like a dog’s;
A week he lived on lizards, but right along he
And strikes an old dead camel (I swear to God
’tis true),
He sliced the hump for tucker, the hide to bind
his shoe. .
I met him outside Morgan’s, he was cussin pretty
hot, . ,
An’ we blued a crown together—it was all the
stuff I’d got. .
An’ I bummed around some later, an’ raised four
bloomin’ quid, _
An* meant to take ’em to his camp; yes, s elp
me, boys, I did
Laid out to make right down that ridge, soon as
I’d had a spell ; ...
An’ why the deuce I didn’t then? Well, blowed if
I can tell.
“I haven’t got no money,” I s’pose he figured
that; . ,
Then wrapped the paper round a stick and spiked

Old Prof. M‘Coy, lecturing on the Aus’
tralian rook - cod : —“ Gentlemen, this fish wa s
once very instructive. Soon after I came to Aus"
tralia in the fifties I was invited to a grand
dinner in the old Criterion Hotel of ‘ merchants,
bankers, and others,’ who had been brought
together to taste a new fish said to be identical
with true Newfoundland cod, a bank of which
had been discovered in Vic. waters by Vic. fisher-
men—practical men, you know. The givers of the
dinners proposed to form a company to subscribe
so many thousands for a fishing-fleet, so many
thousands for shore curing-factories, and so much,
of course, to the discoverers and promoters.
Statistics of Newfoundland fisheries were quoted,
immense dividends prophesied, the smallness and
inferior flavour accounted for by the fact that the
fishermen with inferior appliances could only
catch a few small ones, and at last my opinion
was asked. Just then the most popular book of
the time was Sam Slick’s ‘How Many Fins has
a Cod?’ That title was my opening sentence.
No one knew. ‘Gentlemen,’ I said, ‘I will
answer Sam Slick’s question. A true cod has
three dorsal fins and two anal ones. Now, as
these fish before us have only two dorsals and one
anal, they are not young true cod; in fact, they
are not true cod at all.’ Thus burst another
South Sea Bubble ! ”

“No person who eats freely of Granuma can possibly suffer from Dyspepsia, Constipation

Herald of Health, p. C 4. Of all Grocers; Wholesale, J. INGLTS & CO., Sydney.
f
The present hideous snob-society mode o
handshaking—jerking out the right hand into a
swan’s-neck sort of scoop from a line rather above
the shoulder-strap level, and gripping in mid-air—
is said to have originated in the fact that “Wales”
once had a bad boil on or near his biceps, and
couldn’t manage to shake hands anyhow else.
For coughs, colds you can’t beat Colemane
and Sons Eucalypte Extract.*
“ The fact that white women will deal
with Chinamen and other Asiatics and pay them,”
writes “Scotty the Wrinkler,” “is well exem-
plified by one town in N.S. Wales, and I have at
last found an additional reason for the deal and
the pay. Take the market-gardener. The women
will not part to the white man. 4 Put it down,
send your bill every month.’ At the end of a
month white-grown vegetables are at an end, and
the white man will either sue at once or let it
slide. But the Chow will take an ‘ad interim’
instalment of a shilling or two, and go on. ' Very
shame at length compels payment by hubby, who
can’t stand being ‘sued by a Chinaman.’ I have
heard from a music-teacher that she seldom gets
a settlement unless in eggs or milk, and that
months after the score is badly missed half-a-
erown will come, with ‘Mother has no more change
to-day.’ And it is the same yesterday, to-day,
and forever. Why don’t the Chinkies start piano-
teaching? Our girls must learn to sing ‘ Say Au
Revoir,’ but they needn’t pay. Last year a J.P.’s
wife drove up to the garden of a friend of mine
and bought and carried away a load of vegetables.
This opened an account which still stands at the
one transaction, unsettled.”
HIS INSPIRATION.
The country fried ; no rain fell down,
The sun burned fiercely overhead,
It glittered on the blistered town,
And on the grass land, bare and brown,
Encumbered with the woolly dead.
The faithful flocked to parson Jones,
And bade him kneel and pray and pray.
But Ephraim would not bend his bones,
He stalled them off with hopeless groans
From burning day to burning day.
And people talked with pious spite,
And branded Jones an infidel.
But Ephraim changed one Sunday night,
And prayed before them with his might,
And, lo 1 the rain it fell and fell.
And now the flock feels keen remorse,
And o’er its doubts of Ephraim mourns,
But Ephraim never saw the force
Of prayer to alter nature’s course—
His faith was solely in his corns.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “ Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No, 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “Pure Gold ” and “Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will nob
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the asrency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ THREE CASTLES” and cc O^k-IPST-A-ZCsT. 7 '
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South WMes to allow the American lobacco Co., Limited, to monopolism
the wholei of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles’ 9 and “Capstan 99 Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
‘‘Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what peopl
should or should not smoke.

JONES OF JIMBEROOMBA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was Jones of Jimberoomba was a discontented
man,
It was Jones who swore ’twas barren from
Beersheba unto Dan,
It was Jones who told his fellowmen, with scowl
of noble scorn,
’Twould be money in their pockets had they never
yet been born.
He was grumbling in his cradle ; he was growling
(it was said)
When they took him to be christened, when she
took him to be wed ;
He was grumbling on his death-bed, with his
comrades at his side,
And as soon as breath for grumbling failed he
turned his toes and died.
And when our days, too, were numbered, high in
Heaven, it so befell,
That we met him as an angel in the meads of
asphodel;
There were battlements of crystal, there were
leagues of sapphire sea,
And a seraph robed in glory, with a diadem, was
he.
Came a strain of mystic music like a magic mur-
mur by,
Cherub forms of fairy beauty floated far and
floated nigh,
And a beatific splendor seemed to rest upon the
throng,
And the winds that swept the portals were the
soaring wings of Song.
And we gazed upon the seraph (dare I call him
Seraph Jones?)
Seraph Jones of Jimberoomba —and we asked in
dulcet tones:
“ You were always, Jones, a grumbler, in our
little earthly sphere ;
Would you tell us, gentle seraph, can you find a
grievance here ? ”
Through the heavenly orbs of Jones a flash •£
earthly fire there blazed,
Slow he doffed his glorious head-gear—on his
golden crown he gazed ;
And with angry voice, “D’ye call that thing a
fit ? ” the seraph cried —
And we knew that Jones was living though they
said that Jones had died.

ON WIRRABO ROAD.
G-one are now old coaching ways
And the merry drinking days,
When the passengers on top
Treated Jehu to a drop.
And, ’tis said, a man in black
Drank one night to Hell-fire Jack—
Jack, who in a storm of hail
Raced for miles the Southern mail.
It was in the long ago,
On the road to Wirrabo.
Out of fashion are the nights—
Rum gal«re and stand-up fights—
When the shanty-keeper’s grog
Landed teamsters in a bog.
Gone the break-neck driving days
When Jack Fletcher swam his bays,
Covered head to foot with mud,
Slap-bang through the creek in flood.
It was in the long ago,
On the read to Wirrabo.
Vanished with Bohemian days
Careless, open-handed ways ;
When the squatter paid to see
Every man-Jack on the spree,
And the young bloods, flush and gay,
Kept it up till break o’ day,
Cantering home along the track
Side by side with Hell-fire J ack.
It was in the long ago,
On the road to Wirrabo.
Worthy of more finished rhymes,
Venturous, Homeric times !
When the pris’ner, left unbound,
Felled Olendinning to the ground.
But when outlaw Monaghan
Chased the coach by Ryan’s Run,
Fletcher, never drawing rein,
Put a bullet in his brain.
It was in the long ago,
On the road to Wirrabo.

BULLOCKY BILL AND HIS OLD RED
TEAM.
From the river sidin’, the railway town,
’R the dull new port there three days down,
For’ard an’ back on the up-hill track,
With a creak o’ the jinker ’n a ringin’ crack.
Slow as a funeral, sure as steam,
Bullocky Bill an’ his ole red team.
Ploughin’ around by the ti-tree scrub,
Four wheels down t’ the bloomin’ huo,
Hither an’ fro, with their heads all low,
Bally, an’ Splodger, an’ Banker go.
Men in the ranges much esteem
Bullocky Bill an’ his ole red team.
Wormin’ about where the tall trees spring,
Surging ahead whep the clay bogs cling ;
A rattle of lash ’n of language rash
On the narrer edge of immortal smash.
He’d thread a bead or walk a beam,
Bullocky Bill with his ole red team.
Climbin’ a ridge where the red stars ride;
Straddlin’ down on the other side,
With a whistle an’ grind, an’ a scramble blind,
And a thunderin’ gum-tree slung behind.
But they always get there, hill or stream,
Bullocky Bill an’ his ole red team.
Engines ’r stamps fer the mines about,
Tools fer the men who’re leadin’ out;
Tucker, an’ boose, an’ the latest news
Back where the bunyip stirs the ooze.
Pioneers with the best we deem
Bullocky Bill an’ his ole red team.

Dear Bulletin, —On the track I have met,
I think, the whole staff of The Bulletin, except
the editor. Strangely enough, I never met
anyone who said he wrote or drew for any
other paper. Stranger still, your staff seems
always hard up, and has a yearning for
beer. To be a Bulletin man of note on a
station or a shanty is something, I tell you.
This season at a Western station the slushy
turned out to be Henry Lawson (your Henry). It
is very remarkable how Henry disguises himself.
I hardly knew him —he looks different every time I
meet him.—E.K.
At Double Bay, Sydney, are the remains
of a dismantled stone wharf to which, in the brave
days of the System, military offenders were brought
to receive their “ six dozen ” and other little
luxuries of that sort. The bored stone to which
the triangles were attached may still be seen at
low tide. It is a dreadful thing for any country
to have a past whose relics consist mostly of
ancient cats and triangles and gags and leg-irons
and legends of old-time Gabbetts, and the ruins of
dismantled gaols, and the dry-rot of here and there
a superannuated gallows, and the ghosts of bygone
lags, and things like that.
SMALL MATTERS.
1 —OWNER (to prospective buyer): “ I’m goin’ to
be perfectly honest with you, and tell you
that the horse has one little trick, although
it really isn’t worth mentioning.”
2 —Buyer : “Oh, no! Certainly not! Very
small matter, indeed.”
3—"And, of course, that’s not worth mentioning
either.”
A biography of the late Professor Huxley
is now in course of preparation by his son, Mr.
Leonard Huxley, of Charterhouse, Godaiming,
England. The Professor spent nearly four years
(1847-50) in and about Australia, and married an
Australian lady. It is believed that many in-
teresting letters written by him in these days and
dealing with his Australian experiences are still
extant, and any persons possessing such docu-
ments would lend material assistance in the pre-
paration of the biography by forwarding them to
Mr. Leonard Huxley at the above address. They
will be carefully returned after copies have been
taken.
The devout Jap. lady carries about with
her a lot of prayers printed on small squares of
fine rice-paper, and when any trouble comes she
piously swallows one of them. The Mohammedan,
in times of great anxiety, writes a short petition
on a board with charcoal, washes it off and drinks
the water. And the European views them both
with contempt, as heathens who don’t understand
the rudiments of religion, because they take their
prayers in while he sends his out.

At the Inlet Mouth .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was a strangely pretty part of a wild,
hard coast, where the white-beached inlet broke
into the sea. Through the narrow mouth the
current ran ten miles an hour, carving for itself a
rounded, sloping bank which glistened in the sun
like undressed marble. But the rounded bank
was a quicksand, and there was only a swirl here
and there to tell how the current ran. Which
shows that appearances may deceive. But that is
a platitude.

Gilroy had had words with his partner
that morning, but only shags and curlews could
overhear them, and they couldn’t tell who was
victor in that struggle under the cliff. Probably,
too, they heard the chink of gold, as Gilroy and
his partner divided the business profits the night
before; but they didn’t read the Melbourne papers,
so they were ignorant as to its source ; and, even
supposing they knew all about the bank robbery,
it is unlikely they "would have suspected the part-
ner of black, black treachery—but Gilroy did.
The partner lay bound to a plank ; not roughly
or hastily bound, but neatly pinioned as though
he had met one stronger than he, and one who
was prepared to take vengeance slowly —and
strongly. He was raised above the ground by a
couple *f small kegs which were tied to the board
at his back, and his face was that of a man physic-
ally and morally beaten—which is not good to
look upon. He was murmuring something about
“ knife ” and “ finishing me off,’’but Gilroy hardly
seemed to hear. Apparently he meditated other-
wise.
* • • *
Gilroy had arrived at the Inlet Mouth—
where the current ran 10 miles an hour —and he
bore in his arms a Burden with nail-kegs fixed to
it. The Burden made no remonstrance—he was
past that—and Gilroy stopped at the brink to
think . . . but not for long This partner
would^ have a chance of being picked up by a pass-
ing ship, and he smiled as he thought of that; and
so the Burden plashed on to the surface of the
current, and a moment later was bobbing its way
over the ripples towards the Southern Ocean. The
partnership was dissolved.
* * * *
He turned to go, or would have had
not his foot slipped into slimy sand. Suddenly the
other foot sank too, while a sweat broke out on the
strong man’s forehead. A desperate struggle to
free himself—and the'sand came over his knees.
He shut his teeth and groaned, while the crisp
white shells poured in mockery on-him from the
bank above. He struggled again, quietly this
time and with method, but the grasp of the devil
seemed to drag him down, while the “ lap, lap ” of
the outgoing tide seemed a message from his part-
ner to come and join him. And the sand was up
to his hips.
He thought in agony of the box of gold in the
hole under the cliff, and rapidly, very rapidly, he
ran over the events of last night—and to-day. He
thought of his cronies in Melbourne, in the Islands,
everywhere ;he thought, too, of his mother. He
longed to be back again with these—all except his
mother. But he was being sucked steadily down,
f° r time was passing, and he was weaker now, and,
as the sweat trickled down his face, he held his
arms high that they might escape the slimy
? urs ® t . hat hound him. He laughed an ugly,
harsh laugh as a seabird dashed in his face,
for he knew what was to come. The sand
wa ? _ U P , to J llB shoulders. One more struggle,
and t° r the first time he found voice. He shouted,
he cursed, he raved, for at last his feet had touched
something solid and firm, but he was powerless to

* * * •
The lonely horseman on the inlet beach
had seen a cormorant sitting on a rock about the
size of a man’s head with clouds of others wheeling
round it. To relieve the monotony of his ride he
fired—and hit the Rock !
So Gilroy was released from Purgatory, and the
tide came up and took his body away to join his
partner.

BICYCLING IN DARKEST AFRICA.

And give that wheel away?
High Dikes like that are out of date,"
Said Charley Harkawav.
2.—“I like high wheels,” said Billy Bike,
“On Afrie's sunny shoro:
You’re good and safe, Hark! cam. that be
A lion's fearful roar?”

And with terrific bound—
He caught the Little safety wheel,
Because 'twas near the ground.

Was eaten up in state.
The Patent Manaqer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Two mining properties adjoined. Both belonged
to registered companies. One was largely in the
hands of poor men, who had spent 11 years in
bringing in a water-race ; the other was held by
local aristocrats.
It is certain that if France had noted the gun
Krupp sent to Paris Exhibition, in ’6B, the Ger-
man artillery would not have been, as three to one
in ’7O. It is also certain that, if these poor miners
could have seen half-a-yard before their noses, they
would never have tolerated the owners of the next
plot as directors of theirs. But few men can see
straight. Distortion is a form of slumber. In our
civilisation slumber is fatal. Both claims paid
dividends. The one with the better supply of
water was the better property.
Machinations began: complications arose. To
be versed in confusion is to be a financier. The
profitable manager was sacked, and a patent one
put in his place. The creature simply danced
when the directors twiddled his string.
He stripped from 80ft. of top stuff a large area,
say, two acres. He constructed several new (and
necessary) tail-races. He laid by a store of blocks.
Of course, shares fell. For two years there was
no return. Presently it was carried by a majority
of 50 shares in 24,000 that the claim should be
leased to the adjoining party for the next two
years.
This was done. The claim paid grandly. When
SORRY HE SPOKE.
SHE : “ This wine is over sixty years old.”
HE: "Bottle it yourself?”
it was handed back, tail-races were choked, boxes
ruined, blocks wasted.
Then shares fell again, and after a solemn
struggle and much round cursing, it was bought in
by “ the dear neighbours ” for one-third its value.
Since then the joint concern has paid handsomely.
It is always the toiler who is diddled.
Now let us finish the manager. As he stood at
the side of the tail-race, which was very deep, a
boulder, sent by Nemesis, detached itself from
above. Descending rapidly, it tapped him firmly
on the head, just behind the ear. Like a pithed
beast, he fell in a heap.
He was taken to the hospital—a common
rendezvous among us. The doctor diagnosed.
He said there was a piece of bone pressing against
the brain. He wished to trepan.
But Geoi ge refused with the same stubbornness
that had been so useful to the directors. The
whole man was the fleshy form of the word
“obstacle.” He fled the institution.
Then he grew silly, and in six weeks he was
dead. For the last fortnight he continually
chanted an obscene song. Ophelia, in her mad-
ness, grew strangely coarse.
POLYPE.
The Coeoaine Fiend.
Hogarth painted the rake’s progress. The
opium-eater’s progress De Quincey wrote. Now a
Vie. doctor, lately deceased, victim to the cocaine
habit, has left behind him an autobiography.
When in the German army, he, after a long
fatiguing forced march, took cocaine inwardly.
Immediately he was a new man, ready for any-
thing. That started him on the oooainist’s path.
From time to time under special circumstances he
again had recourse to the drug, but only as it were
medicinally, as above related. One night in ’B9 he
was sent for to relieve a country doctor who was
in a state of coma. Arrived, he found a syringe
sticking in the comatose man’s breast. Knowing
the trouble, he administered a strong hypodermic
injection; the country doctor at once sat up,
welcomed him heartily, talked brightly. The
memory of that night haunted the autobiographer.
Summoned shortly after to an urgent confinement
case, the summons found him racked by lumbago,
unable to move without extreme pain. He had t«
go. A syringe of cocaine with morphia enabled
him five minutes after to set out on a two miles
drive through a bitter cold night and a blinding
snowstorm. Before starting out on his return, he
repeated the dose. That fixed the habit, and he
was a cocainist. After a dose, he says, the eooain-
ist feels _ exalted, anxious to make his mark,
brilliant in talk, bright and quick of mental grasp;
his hearing is enormously increased “so that one
really (sic) can hear the flies walking over the
paper.” That is in the early period. But as the
habit grows, horrible symptoms are the followers
of the dose. He thinks every voice is some slan-
der on himself; therefore he becomes a solitary.
The pext stage is “the hunting of the cocaine
bug.” Worms and insects seem to move about on
his skin, his clothes, any implement he is using ;
but he never , sees them on other people or on
freshly laundered clothes. This “cocaine bug ” s
a characteristic symptom of the habit, and in its
origin quite different from the “jim-jams” of
alcoholism. Presently, night turns to day. The
night hours are spent in repeated syringings, till,
toward morning, coma ensues. The deceased
doctor for some time actually had a hospital war-
der come at a fixed hour every morning to revive
him with a strong injection of the drug. There-
after, come the hallucinations of threatenings and
persecutions, so apparently real that this cocainist
actually bought a pistol and three St. Bernard
dogs to protect him from his imaginary foes. One
awful night, the dogs seemed to talk of him and
slander him. He sprang on a table, a dagger in
one hand and a pistol in the other. One of the
dogs he shot dead. When his hospital warder
came in the morning, he was still on the table,
armed. Then the hallucinations took a filthy and
disgusting form. One day entering a surgical
theatre, everyone present—operator, nurses, at-
tendants, students, —all seemed stark naked.
That way, he knew, madness lay. He rushed
from the room to a private lunatic asylunf kept by
a friend and placed himself under restraint. In a
year’s time he had spent £l6OO on the drug. In a
physiological summary, the deceased doctor says
the cocainist early loses the appetite for solid food,
but likes lollies, cakes and sweets : diarrhcea be-
comes chronic; mental work becomes distasteful,
manual labour is preferred; the personal appear-
ance is neglected, but of this the cocainist is un-
conscious. Lastly, the system breaks up and the
end comes. This dead doctor was a man of high
qualifications, a most talented physician and
surgeon, and author of many valuable papers.
He came of a most intellectual family.

is an annual midnight howl-parade, at which
the coolies carry round the town a colored tissue-
paper temple, and wind up by burying same in
some lonely spot, meanwhile beating tom-toms,
dancing, crying, and generally “going off their
heads.” No one ever tried to—nor ever will-
stop this business, but the fact of the candidate
telling them they could have it secured him their
vote.

The commercial - minded Japs, are just
now disposed to puff their native products with a
little military “ blow,”it seems. F. Kanematuse,
Esq. (he has a Sydney agency), who claims to be
“leader of the direct Import and Export to from
Australia and Japan,” lately sent a consignment
of “beautiful and fine every Japan wares to sell
by public auction,” at Adelaide. The catalogue
from which the foregoing samples of E. K. E’s
English language are quoted, was sent over with
the goods from his head office in Kobe. It directs
public attention to the peculiar virtues of Japan
wares in this hour of triumph. Thus, in fancy
type on the front cover
“ The greatest Victor in the far East.
Buyers will be obtain the very strong power and good
Lucky.”
Evidently the leader of the direct Export meant
to suggest that each lot would prove a mascotte to
the purchaser and enable him to wipe the floor of
the market-place with any business rivals who
didn’t bid. “Buyers will,be obtain the very
strong power and good Lucky ! ”
Dear Bulletin,—A trait in the native
bear or koala not commonly known, I think.
Reading Nature a few days ago, I came across a
letter signed “ Arthur Nicols,” in which he tells
stories of native bears he once kept in Australia,
—all taken young. Three were intensely fond of
tobacco in any form, and especially of strong
black “sheepwash.” One of them to which he
gave a foul clay pipe, saturated with tobacco oil
and products, ate the whole of the stem. Another,
which used to sit on his shoulder while he wrote
or read, would take the pipe out of his mouth, and
proceed to chew it. This one was evidently a bad
lot, for he also loved whisky and water. Ap-
parently the tobacco and whisky did the beasties
good. Looking over the Transactions of the Mel-
bourne Medical Society, I find a paper there in
which the writer tells how he often found koalas
feeding merrily in an abandoned tobacco planta-
tion not far from his house. Perhaps that was
how Nicols’s koalas acquired their taste for to-
bacco. Certainly Nicols caught his young, but
then I have caught a 4-year-old youngster puffing
cigarettes. But where did the koalas first get the
whisky? Apropos of this depraved taste, there
was a sheep once shipped on one of the P. and O.
boats, which, while fattening, suddenly acquired
a taste for tobacco. The cook was afraid to
kill it for the table lest its flesh should be tainted,
so its bad habit saved its life. I have a cat myself
which is quite a connoisseur in vegetables ; and a
friend of mine had a horse which liked beer
hugely. Has this tobacco-chewing habit of tue
koala been widely observed, or are these instances
very exceptional ?—J. S. R.
Messrs. Bergl and Brabbin, of the Bowen
(Q.) Meat Export and Agency Co., are a well-
known firm of sheep and cattle undertakers, who
provide all descriptions of stock with a first-class
funeral, and relieve the squatter of any bother
whatsoever in connection with the final interment
of same in British or other foreign stomachs.
They will take delivery at their Bowen works,
and slaughter, weigh, freeze, bag, brand, ship,
pay freight, and effect insurance from time of
slaughtering until 30 days in London or other
dep6t, and for all these services their current
charges are 1 8-16 d. per lb. for beef, and
1 9-16 d. per lb. for mutton and lamb. If
desired, Messrs. Bergl and Brabbin undertake
disposal of the meat at destination, and their cur-
rent charges in the case of disposal at London are
112-16 d. per lb. for beef, and 1 13-16 d. per lb. for
mutton and lamb. When the much-worried
squatter calculates the weight of anxiety and
responsibility which acceptance of these terms
lifts from his shoulders, Messrs. Bergl and Brabbin
are confident that every stock-track in North
Queensland will be blocked all the year round by
immense multitudes of sheep and cattle converging
to their Bowen meat-works.*

“The Bulleti
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dit
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours:—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of tlie Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians. —The cheap

cheap European pauper to be absolutelj

A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner*
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
i than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter, that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with ho capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
arge fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by com par mg
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form —printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress; it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised. The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red coveris equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—-
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than and
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.
