NEVER before has there been placed
before the public such a series of
astounding disclosures as are to be
found in this book. The rise from obscurity
to immense and diabolical power of this
“mock saint,” who controlled the secret
forces and lured Russia to her betrayal,
is intimately portrayed by the help of
official and confidential documents. The
author writes: —“As one who knows Russia
intimately, I confess that I have often been
astounded when examining the mass of docu-
ments which this dirty Siberian peasant (the
convicted horse-stealer who rose to be the
secret adviser of Nicholas II.) had
secreted in his cellar in Petrograd, so
that the real truth of his traitorous deal-
ings with the Kaiser might be chronicled
in history.”

“I readily admit that the career of Rasputin, the sinister power behind the
Russian throne, and whose story I am here revealing, will appear incredible to
my readers. No work of fiction of mine has contained facts so extraordinary as
the real life of this unwashed charlatan, who, under the active protection of a
debased church, succeeded in establishing himself in the apartments of the
favorite lady-in-waiting upon the Empress, and further to teach his horrible
‘religion’ to the innocent daughters of the Tsar.” —William Le Quean.
[AUTHOR’S PREFACE]
Why This Book Was Written
In the following pages I have attempted to take the reader behind the veil
of the Imperial Russian Court, and to disclose certain facts which in this
twentieth century may appear almost incredible.
As one who knows Russia, who has. traversed the Empire from Virballen to
the Pacific coast, and who has met personally both the ex-Emperor and his consort,
as well as many of the persons herein mentioned, I confess that I myself have
often been astounded when examining the mass of documents which this dirty
Siberian peasant—the convicted horse-stealer who rose to be the secret adviser
of Nicholas ll.—had happily secreted in the safe in his cellar in the Gorokhovaya,
in Petrograd, so that the real truth of his traitorous dealings with the Kaiser
might be chronicled in history.
I here publish the story of the mock-monk’s amazing career as a further
contribution to the literature upon Germany’s spy system and -propaganda so
cleverly established as an insidious adjunct to her military attack upon the
civilisation of our times-
The conversations herein recorded have been disclosed by patriotic Russians,
the truth has been winnowed out of masses of mere hearsay, and the cipher tele-
grams and letters'l have copied from the decoded originals placed at my disposal
by certain Russians, Allies of ours, Avho desire, for the present, to remain
anonymous. WILLIAM LE QUEUX.

The Red Page
War Correspondents
James Edmond asks us to be bumble: —
After ail, the old men knew something and the
young men shouldn't put on frill. The Hun is a
great war correspondent, but there were pebbles on
the literary beach before he was born. Consider
these unknown and unnamed gentlemen of the press
who wrote the books of Kings and Chronicles. Solo-
mon slew 120,000 sheep and 22,000 oxen in one act,
which wasn’t exactly war, but it was a great deal of
meat, llehoboam, feeling peeved against Jeroboam,
mobilised 180,000 of his best soldiers —this from a
country about one and a half days’ ride across on a
very moderate l]orse —-but thought better of it. His
successor, Abijam, being more peeved, mobilised
400,000 men, and Jeroboam, from the adjacent king-
dom of Israel, which took the writer four days in a
buggy to survey it from end to end, collected 800,000.
Then Abijam became real wild, and viewed Jeroboam
as superfluous, and killed 500,000 in one day, and
Jeroboam was never quite the same afterwards.
Baasha of Israel invaded Judah, but seeing Asa, the
King, hanging round casually with 580,000 troops,
all “mighty men of valor,” he became worried, and
when a still bigger king took a hand Baasha felt
that he was becoming disliked and left. In one of
his quieter moments Asa defeated an army of
1,000,000 niggers. Elijah killed 950 false prophets,
which suggests that false prophecy was a .big, in-
dustry. This was in the troubled days of Jezebel,
and at the same time Obadiah concealed 100 true
prophets in one lot to save their lives, which implies
that true prophecy was also in a large way. Benha-
dad, of Syria, was dining in his camp with 32 other
kings, when Israel fell on them and practically wiped
out the 33 armies. The thick-headed monarch didn't
take the hint, but came again next year and had
100,000 men slain in a single day. To add insult to
injury, a wall (of some size) fell on the remains
of the army and killed 27,000. Things were looking
up with Jehoshaphat of Judah about this time —
Judah can be crossed in two days’ buggy-ride with-
out undue distress —-and he kept 1,160,000 soldiers
under arms, apart from garrisons. Yet he and his
big but reptile contemporary of Israel were both
shamefully battered by the irrepressible Benhadad.
Despite the fact that he and the 32 other kings had
been extinguished one year, and that, in addition to
other drawbacks, a wall had fallen on 27,000 of his
soldiejrs the next year, the Syrian never knew when
he was licked. King Jehoram was chiefly remark-
able inasmuch as he died aged 40 leaving a son aged
42. This wasn’t exactly war correspondence, but it
was dashed wonderful. In Amaziah’s days Judah
was past its prime, and the king- could only go to
war with 400,000 followers. Uzziah, who came after
him, was even less fortunate, though he banged things
about with 307,500 men. The line of great fighting
kings ended, about here. Certainly Amon was a
gkeat-grandfather at the age of 40, or thereabouts,
but that was more numerous than military. There
was still some money left, for Nebuchadnezzar looted
the temple at Jerusalem of its treasures, including
5400 vessels, large and small, of real gold—this
although the building, about 35 yards long by 12
yards broad, had been plundered six times,
and at the sixth looting even the gilt was scraped off
the doors. The latest operation was not only genuine
war; it was also very lucky for Nebuchadnezzar.
Truly there were reporters in those days.
The Children’s Library
“Gee, Bill! Ten bob for tbe first kid in !”
There was no ten bob, but a joker thought
he would add some sparkle to the proceed-
ings if he dropped a whisper that half a
sovereign awaited the first to get in the
door. He certainly did add some sparkle.
We had to put down a barrage in the
shape of a burly assistant to save the door.
And when the door was opened barrage and
all -went like the cataract of Lodore —
And foaming and roaming,
And working and-jerking,'
And guggling and struggling.
The foam of the first wave was provided by
the petticoats of Sis, who proposed to be
right on the spot where the good things
were. It was the opening day, not of a
picture palace, but of the Children’s Library
in connection with the Sydney Municipal
Library.
Bill and Sis in the old lending-room of the
library were impersonal items. We did not
like this; we often saw Bill hovering round
the poetry section, but coming away baffled
by too much learning—or too many words.
And sometimes Bill’s hands were clamoring
for soap and water. It was hard to turn
aside from Bill, but he was only a small
part of a big whole. When new quarters for
the library were mooted it was resolved that
Bill and Sis should have a place where they
were the big and only whole. By flooring-in
a lift-well and cutting a hole in a three-foot
wall, the thing was done, and to-day the
youngsters have a library all their own.
When Bill and (yes, occasionally) Sis
arrive with hands adorned with matter out
of place, nowadays they make straight for a
wash-hand basin, and our only fear is that
there will be no money left for books when
the bill for liquid soap is satisfied. We
cleared the market out of green soap, and
now we are using red —a fatal move, as all
the experimenters have to start again to see if
the red smarts out of the container as well
as the green.
Our children’s librarians for the first time
have an opportunity of regarding each Bill
and Sis as personal units, and delightful
units they are proving. The kiddies some-
times tell a story big with meaning in a few
artless words.
“Mother says do not give me new books, as
our house is not clean enough to bring them
into,” said one little girl. .
A small boy paid a shilling a week for. six
weeks to pay for a book he had dropped into
the water. As he handed in his last shilling
and received the damaged book as his own he.
remarked, with a triumphant air: “Ha, ha,
I’m glad I did that! I’ve been round to the
booksellers, and they‘have all got that book
marked at 10s. Gd., and it only cost me 65.”-
His name is I key.
What do children- read?. Anything and
everything! I believe that if we put a. copy
of “Principia Mathematica” (than which I
Lnow no more fearsome thing to open) in
the Children’s Library, there would arise a
small boy game enough to take it home for
a wrestle. I was standing one day outside
the Library talking to a man, and he put

Till the heart of him yearn to her, seeing her
so”?
Plow should we dream of it, how should we
know
That the sea ceased play at the grey earth’s
knee,
A song on her mouth and a gift in her eyes,
For the ages to come and the wooing to be?
Ere Earth of her magic had wrought the
first tree
The song of the pine-walk was sung at her
knee !
And the delicate first little moon in the skies,
Through the murk of the centuries seeing us
here,
Set flashing her shuttle, and, canopy-wise,
She wove us a mantle of silver and sighs,
Ere the darkness had fled from primordial
skies!
So the gift has come down to us shining and
clear,
The scheming accomplished, the centuries
spanned.
And the dream that the universe hid and
held dear
Is ours for a lifetime, a day or a year,
To keep, as it came to us, shining and clear.
Oh, the little pine-walk where we wander
was planned
For our wooing full many an seon ago.
Ere Time from the plasm with leisurely
hand
Plad moulded our bodies or breath in them
fanned,
The little pine-walk for our wooing was
planned.

The world I’d give could I forget
That your lips taught me how to woo.
I knew not love until we met;
The world I’d give could I forget
You taught me, for I wonder yet
What man it was who first taught you.
The world I’d give could I forget
That your lips taught me how to woo.

Cosy—An Idyll.
They’d called her Cosy whilst her hair hung
loose:
The name was pretty, and remained in use
When, in the flush of womanhood’s aurora,
She told me that her real name was Cora.
Cosy by nature: free from tantrums, nerves
And fitful moodiness ; her graceful curves
Suggested cuddle transcendentalised, serene —
In short, a pure, plump girl; a gracious
queen.
And oh, I loved her—in the way of speaking
Of fondness that forswears possession-seek-
ing.
Fair visions of slim ankles, silken “hosey,”
Perturbed me not if they belonged to Cosy.
Her mother rightly deemed her “safe” with
me.
I took her out and brought her back to tea;
And after tea she sang of birds and things—
The sort of songs a modest maiden sings—
And looked at me with eyes that feigned to
glisten,
As maidens do who have a boy to listen.
Then was I happy, with the full content
Of youth obsessed by new-born sentiment.
Anon we sought the sofa, where we spoke
In whispers, and cut oft a little joke,
Till Dad went off to bed and Mum grew
dozey,
And then my arm stole round the waist of
Cosy.
Bazaars and lectures were our chief pur-
suits ;
We raved of flowers and discoursed on
fruits;
And giving her one night a birthday-book,
I kissed the hand that clutched the gift she
took,
And all the world was bright. She neither
smiled
Nor frowned, but called me “Silly child.”
A Methodist she was, and oft at church
I shared her dreams of Biblical research,
The while the parson talked around the text,
Of lines that came before, or followed next {
For, was the shepherd ne’er so dull and
prosy,
I loved my Bible when I sat by Cosy.
Heigho! She left the town where we were
born.
Pier father, well-endowed with oil and corn,
(But not, Oh, not with wine), moved up in
life,
And Cosy Kemp became a deacon’s wife;
A holy deacon’s wife, so I was told.
And I—l soon skedaddled from the fold,
A wayward sheep, forgetful of the Lord.
But now. grown old in sin, aweary, bored,
I’d fain be good again, as in the time
When lectures urged me to resolves sublime
And all the future in my sight was rosy,
And church was Heaven, and all the angels
Cosy.

OSTRICHES AND THE GRIM
REALITY OF IT.
The Allies are trying 1 to stop, the war by
stopping the German. The Berlin pro-
gramme is to stop it by stamping the Allies
into the mud. According to various resolu-
tions passed by numerous bodies purporting
to speak for Australian Labor unions, the
best way to stop it is to stop reinforcements,
the ground taken being that if all hands did
this the war would peter out. Up to date
the Allies have not stopped the German. He
is in possession of large blocks of captured
territory. His armies appear to be in good
nick. The other armies are getting severely
mauled. The fact is fairly plain that if the
U.S.A. had not come in when the Russian
went out Berlin would already have got its
way. Then the war would stop, all right.
Whether Australia was unanimous on the
subject or not, the reinforcement problem
would cease to be worth worrying about. But
there would be other matters to think over,
for the dead past never completely buries
its dead and the new day has never yet been
an old one all over again. Meanwhile the rela-
tive merits of (1) stopping the war by either
of the plans relied on by the fighting coun-
tries and (2) helping the German to keep
going by the withdrawal of interruption are
worth Australians’ attention. There are
two reasons why. The first is that if the
Germans are not stopped Kaiserdom will
have its way; the second that if they are
blocked military autocracy will be banished
from the world. There is a minor incidental
reason—that at rock-bottom the Australian
stands to lose more if this war goes the
wrong way than any other person on earth.
He would lose both his identity and his job
and start on a fresh contract with a new
shift boss.
Now, the reasons why the Allies should
want to stop the German are just those
which would impel a citizen of Wagga to
put on his fighting face if someone arrived
at his door with a demand for half the back-
yard and a share of his wages every week and
an announcement that he had already appro-
priated Bananaland, the Speck and West-
ralia. Take France. If the Allies are de-
feated the German will most certainly
despoil her of those immense mineral de-
posits in the North and North-East that were
overlooked by Bismarck in ’TO, appropriate
the French oversea colonies and put the
French people under heavy financial tribute.
Nothing would remain of France but a
broken and bankrupt remnant of what was
there before. That he had not bled France
white was one of Bismarck’s greatest mis-
eries. That it should be done now was one
of the cardinal objects Germany had in view
during the long years* of preparation before
1914. To prevent this ghastly immolation
of France is why the French are trying to
stop the German. Take Britain. If the
German is not stopped Britain will be like
a whale stranded in the Northern Sea. The
Prussian has been hungry not only for the
day when he might see Britain economically
smashed and what is called “the Empire’’ in
ruins, but for the time to come when the
spirit of freedom which Britain has carried
through the world should be overtaken by
another conception of human liberty. Take
the U.S.A. A victorious Germany, hating
republican. institutions as it hates the idea
of getting licked, swaggering over Europe
! and half of Asia, would to the American
people be an eternal nightmare* for no
democracy would be safe with this terror at
its gates. It is because they want to be safe
-—because they cannot stand by and see other
democracies butchered so that armed force
may rule the earth —that Uncle SAM' and
Jonathan have got a gun and want to stop
the German.. All these seem fairly good rea-
sons why, in one place and another, the
idea of allowing the • armies and navies fac-
ing the Germans to evaporate is not popular.
To The Bulletin they appear good, solid
reasons why Australians who blither about
stopping the war by staying at home ought
to explain the moral or material advan-
tages of their plan to this or any
other country except Prussia. To Ger-
many, drunk with notions of world
domination, obsessed by ideas that were long
ago throttled by free peoples, the prize looks
greater than anything ever dreamed of by
Greek or Roman. Every one of the German
reasons for not wanting to be stopped makes
a thousand arguments why Australians
should be keeping the vultures off the car-
case, It is sheer madness to say that to
Australia it does not matter if Germany is
a winner—that the Commonwealth can be
defended, from invasion, and all the rest of
it.. Against such a Germany as victory in
this war would create Australia would be
helpless. There is no use having any delu-
sions on that point.
* *. * *
Someone writing to The Bulletin last
week argued that a certain justification is to
be found for Australians who want to let the
German win in the circumstance that Capital
is not doing its share in the war, that some
people are making big profits, that the cost
of living is going up, and that Labor is
right in “feeling there is something very
wrong.” The argument is tragic. To say
that a people are entitled not to resist a
gross oppression because they themselves
had failed to evolve a system of economic
perfection is neither sense nor anything like
it. Fortunes are being made in France and
Britain and America, too. The cost of
living in those countries has soared up higher
than in Australia. Capital is a shirker
everywhere. It is its very nature to be so.
But are the political imperfections and eva-
sions of free people to be turned as enemy
weapons against their liberty? Are their
follies towards themselves to be accepted as
reasons why they should be plundered by
an invader without protestation? Argu-
ments on such lines are mere excuses ad-
vanced to camouflage others that are too
sinister for exhibition. If the Germans are
stopped the people of Australia have the
future to themselves —a future in which
they can drag ill-gotten fortunes from those
who have them, do what they like with Capi-
tal generally, make innumerable experiments
with the cost of living, and otherwise push
along to the Millennium or wherever they
have the wit to go. If the German is not
stopped, others will wring fortunes from
Australia. Its workmen will have to revise
their conceptions of the standard of ■ living—
and incidentally of working. There will be
a whole heap of reasons then for “feeling
that there is something very wrong”—-also
for wishing to Heaven that there was a chance
of putting things only as wrong as they were
before. It may all come well in the end;
but only if the German is stopped can there
be hope of escape from disaster. And the
most certain way of not stopping him is to
adjourn from the job and maunder about the
size of the profiteer’s wallet.
LEGENDS OF HORATIUS AND
OTHERS (DECEASED).
The efficient enemy in our midst always
wears some disguise of friendship to hide his
emotions. He would be of little use as an
e-npmy if he went about naked. Thus the
table at public meetings is smitten almost
to death by orators who believe in compul-
sory service when the foe gets here, and who
go strong with the slogan, “No conscription
except for the defence of Australia against
direct attack.” But how can this country
be defended against the direct attack of an
enemy who has command of the sea? In
the first place it would be a case of less
than 5,000,000 population—say a little over
1,000,000 possible soldiers —defending a
battle-line 8850 miles long—that is to say,
the coast-line. There would be 113 to the
mile. Of course more than half the line—
the part that the defenders can’t reach by
rail —would be abandoned without a blow.
Nothing could prevent that. While the
eneipy’s war armament was attending
strictly to business, merchant ships could
bo used to dot the surrendered coast-line
w r ith settlements, agricultural, pastoral and
semi-military, at convenient places. These
could be provided with colored or other
cheap toilers, and the idea wouM. be to link
them together later on with railways built
by our own slave labor. The occupant would
possess at least one isolated capital, Port
Darwin, with one of the finest harbors in the
world, and 200 miles of isolated railway
(54 miles not quite finished). His real
trouble would only start further south. Aus-
tralia’s big lines have, however, an unfor-
tunate habit of hugging the coast; so as to
make things easy for him. A landing party
at Gladstone, where the main line runs
within a few yards of the sea and where
there is a fine harbor and an almost imper-
ceptible population, could do in a few hours
an amount of wreckage that would cut oft
Central and North Queensland front the
south, and leave their people and their rail-
way rolling stock marooned as if on an
island. A raid on Bundaberg, where the
conditions are much the same, and a few
more explosives would cut off another large
section of Queensland with its people, its
food supplies and its railway stock. If New-
castle was captured, or if a single herd of
bombs was dropped from the air or the sea
or both on Hawkesbury bridge, the railway
system north of Sydney would be cut into
four broken sections, and three of them,
with all their branches, would be wholly
isolated. If both Newcastle and the Hawkes-
bury bridge were rushed by the enemy there
would be five sections, four of them as use-
less to the rest of the States as if they were
in Brazil. Incidentally, two-thirds of the
population would be on one side of the break
without coal to light its fires or drive its
engines; and two-thirds of the coal would
be on the other side, pretty much at the dis-
posal of the enemy. The N. S. Wales South
Coast coal-mines could be cut off from Syd-
ney by the blowing up of a single tunnel,
and there are plenty of tunnels to choose
from, all within a few yards of the shore.
Then the mines, which are also close to the
shore, could, to a great extent, be put out
of commission. After that there wouldn’t
be much coal left.
Except perhaps the Murray Bridge in S.
Aus., there are no weak points for sudden
attack on the line between Sydney and
Adelaide. Adelaide, loafing happily on an
open shore, is very weak. At Port Augusta
the western transcontinental railway is
squatting on the beach crying out for a brick
to be thrown at it, and when that brick is
thrown it is good-bye to Westralia and a
good part of S. Aus. as a section of the
defence scheme. Then Australia would be
cut into five or six isolated parts, while Tas-
mania, if an enemy held the sea, would be a
seventh. Port Augusta is not a fortress nor
even a big town. It contains about 1300
people; Gladstone has the same; Bunda-
berg has about 10,000; Hawkesbury, where
the bridge is, has practically none; Murray
Bridge has a few score. And at these few
lonesome coastal and semi-coastal spots the
defence of Australia could be practically
wiped out in a day. The rest would be a
mere matter of patience. Even if, by a
miracle, the Hawkesbury bridge and New-
castle escaped for a while, and coal was still
available, and if the supply of rolling stock
was much more abundant than it is, it is
reckoned that it would take a month to con-
centrate a decent N. S. Wales force at Bris-
bane by reason of the break of gauge and
the necessity for unloading and re-loading
troops and munitions at the border, where
two different sets of trains would try to keep
time, and fail badly. And forces of any size
from Adelaide and Melbourne would take
two months on the way, with two breaks of
gauge and two unloadings and re-loadings.
And it would be equally bad if the concen-
tration was at Melbourne or Sydney or
Adelaide. As an incident the enemy need
not be there when the labored land-concen-
tration arrived. He could go away at short
notice and loot other cities. All this talk
about shifting troops and munitions and
stores, implies, of course, that there are such
matters to shift. At present there is little
of them, and the traitors who froth so plaus-
ibly about defending Australia on its own
soil do nothing to repair the scarcity.
The conquest of Australia could be an-
nounced in a way that would secure recogni-
tion abroad, if the enemy, who had licked
our Allies when we didn’t expect it and
thus secured the sea, had possession of a
handful of points on the coast. He would
then command the exports and imports, in-
cluding the supply of material that weapons
and locomotives are made from ; practically
all the coal; the headquarters of Govern-
ment, finance and manufacturing industry;
most of the revenue, and the ends of all the
railways. He could eat his way along the
railways at liis leisure. He could spread
himself along the roads with armed motor
vehicles, and the unarmed and unclothed
population could do little or nothing. He
could construct or reconstruct all manner of
public works, and build ships, locomotives,
trucks, cannon, airships, fortifications, etc.,
with the labor of his prisoners. He could
work the. coal-mines in the same . fashion.
The day is past when the rising en masse
of a high-spirited people can expel the proud
but lumbering intruder. The national up-
heaval has to start with insufficient arms
and discipline, and with a great lack of up-
to-date appliances. It depends on its courage
and its desperate resolve to win or perish.
Within a mere handful of years it has been
disqualified. To-day the airship would drop
gas ( the Judges of Israel and spoil
Gideon’s night attack with searchlights. It
would blot out the defence of Saragossa or
Garibaldi's Roman republic with huge
bombs falling from the sky. It would fly
high and find Iyoloktrones or Winkelbied
on his highest mountain, or it would fly low
and_ trace_ William Wallace in his forests.
Or if it didn’t find him in his forests another
branch of science would break his circle of
spears with The unfindable De Wet
and his commando would be located by
Gothas any morning before breakfast, and
Abdel-Ivader’s matchless horsemen would
be run down by tireless steel vehicles carry-
ing machine-guns. Montenegro (one-fourth
the size of Tasmania), by virtue of its tall
mountains and its heroic but not too well
provided soldiery, held its own against all
and sundry for 400 years. It won its last
dazzling victory against the old order of
things in 3912. Then the new order of
things struck it, and being gassed it lasted
about four weeks.
* * * *
Australia, in short, is the one place where
Australia, as it is now, can’t be protected
against a really serious direct attack. The
story of a free and valiant nation defending
its oU r n hearth on its own doorstep is poetic
and pictorial. It calls up meihories of dead
heroes who ar,e quite irrelevant, and of wav-
ing flags which nowadays only betray the
bearer to a telescopic enemy who promptly
shpots the flag with a ten-mile gun. It re-
calls fenced cities that were previous to the
day when Sydney could be bombarded from
Ivatoomba. It is all a legend of the years
Before the Tank and when Fat Bertha was
unborn. But it is a pleasant soporific, used
to keep the country asleep till it is so late
that waking isn’t worth while, and to flatter
it by making treason or cold feet pass as
high-class patriotism. All manner of strange
things pass as something else in war-times.
LANGUAGE AND DEMOCRACY.
In the days before history the Aryan lan-
guage set out to conquer the world. It was
a good little language suited to the people
who made it—a people living in some
cold corner of Europe or Asia where there
was more snow than sunshine and more toil
than leisure. The Aryan people spread
themselves from India to Britain, and took
this language with them; and wherever they
went the language gathered up new ideas
and new color. In the course of ; ages it
became a hundred languages, because in each
place where it had lived it added pew words
to the old and altered the shaples of the
old to suit a new environment. Greek, Latin,
Sanskrit, Lithuanian, Irish and Icelandic
were all children of the parent language; and
each kept busy in its own way improving
itself with any handy sound that could ex-
press a useful local idea better than it had
been able to express it before. The various
languages thus created and improved then
began to creep together again and form new
groupings. The race movements of Europe,
the wars which shook that continent, the
religious persecutions, the growth of trade-
all these tended to bring languages together
and out of several to form one new tongue.
England got the chief benefit owing to her
peculiar situation. The original population
spoke a Celtic tongue akin to Welsh. This
language was modified by the Koman con-
quest, and altogether changed by the Anglo-
Saxon invasion, but never entirely destroyed.
The Saxon and Angle in few cases brought
their wives with them ; and the new com-
munity retained as much of the British lan-
guage as was necessary for the woman’s use
in domestic affairs, and a good deal more
that seemed handy for general purposes.
About the same time the Normans took the
Norse language to northern France, where
it mixed with a tongue composed of the
original Celtic, Latin and the German
brought in by previous Frankish conquerors.'
This language, known as Norman French,
was grafted upon the English stock, which
had also been modified by the Danish of other
invaders from the east. The revival of learn-
ing combined with the influence of the
Church to introduce a constant stream of
Latin words into educated speech, and to
these Science and the Arts added a lot of
Greek terms. Meanwhile England had
become the asylum for every distressed per-
son in Europe, Those who fled from kings
and courts or from plain poverty caused by
the destruction of war made homes in the
island, and retained on the new soil as much
of their old languages as possible. Thus
almost every strand of the unravelled primi-
tive Aryan language, after gaining bulk and
strength in widely-scattered lands, was woven
again into the tongue of modern England.
Nor has the process ceased yet. Australia.
Canada and the United States are still
gathering up words and modes of expression
which make their speech clearer and more
graphic to mirror their thoughts; and with
British trade expansion the language itself
has become so widely known that it bids fair
to conquer the whole world and become at
last universal. Before that happens, how-
ever, it has to take to itself all that is of
special value and use in the other great
languages; and it will be an English as
unlike ours as the speech of Bernard Shaw
is unlike Chaucer’s which in the end
passes as current coin of the mouth among
all lands and peoples. In point of fact, it
will not be English that has triumphed, but
the original Aryan tongue, which, using Eng-
lish as a means to its end, has produced the
perfect medium of human expression.

And this thing is more than an allegory ;
for language is really mankind, in that it
stands for its thought, which is all that is
worth while about it;.. Man cannot think
without words; and the words in which he
clothes himself are ‘l-eally the man. Getting
the history of language, we get the best
history of the race. In the primitive Aryan
people there were beyond doubt certain prin-
ciples which guided the small clans in their
wintry territory. One of these was the desire
for the greatest security for the community
coupled with individual liberty. The very
word “free,” though it is not quite universal
in Aryan languages, goes a very long way
back. It is found in Sanskrit, where it
means love. It is in Gothic, and right
through the middle tongues of Europe. It
is the r,oot of the word “friend.” The free
were originally those of the clan or family,
as opposed to outsiders—those who were
friends, those who should be loved. Here is
the very foundation ideal of democracy. The
same word which stands for personal liberty
stands also for clan or conimunal obligation
and devotion. The European race, like the
European language, set out on a great ad-
venture in remote prehistoric times. It
pushed its way into many lands, faced all
kinds of conditions and difficulties, made vast
experiments in government, but always
clung to an idea] of sober, organised
freedom. In places it endured all man-
ner of despotisms, in places it flung
back into anarchy ; but always there was a
hope that the ultimate good might be found.
It fought bitter and destroying wars under
unworthy leaders and made more bitter and
destructive peace that only more wars could
sweeten : but it still had a will towards the
decent thing, and, striving towards that, it
broke its kings as enthusiastically as. it
obeyed them. All the time it was learning,
gathering information and experience and
moving by zig-zag tracks towards its sure
goal. Like its language it began in course
of ages to regroup itself. The big empires
that rose looked like signs of failure and
retrogression, but they were really stepping-


stones to the wider federation of man. If
. a hundred countries could live under the
British flag, twenty nations be happy under
the French, and a multitude of self-govern-
ing States cluster in harmony under the Stars
and Stripes, there was proof incontrovertible
that the federation of the whole European
race was. possible when the way had been
found.
* * * *
The terrific struggle against Germanism
now going on is part of the race education.
The cooling cannon must find the White man
nearer than ever before to his. goal. A
meeting at the Trades Hall or a Young Men’s
Debating Society may on occasion put the
whole world right by passing a single reso-
lution ; but the world is not so easily put
right as this. The primitive Aryan race
may have been very near its goal when it
first set out on its adventures of the ages;
but a resolution passed on one snow-clad hill-
top would not have fixed its course. Experi-
ence of all things was necessary, even though
in. the long run it might come back to a
point very near that from which it started.
As all students of literature know, and as
the Spring poet must learn before the
Muse will give him a sidelong nod. the
tendency of written language is always
towards a greater simplicity. It has a
larger vocabulary to draw upon and a wider
range of means of expression, but in its
progress towards perfection of form the
choice of words becomes exact and simple.
In fact, the last books this world may write
will, on all appearances, be. in construction
and language, singularly like the simple
speeches of the old storytellers by the Clan
campfire ; yet behind that will lie all the
knowledge of the ages. So it wifi probably be
with the race. The last Government may
be as simple as the first, but with exact
reasons for its simplicity which the first
did not possess. The truest philosophy of
human life is that which sees the world as
a school. The grim tutor War is now busy
with the cane, but the lesson —and all the
lessons—must be learned.
VICARIOUS MOTHERHOOD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At the N. S. Wales Labor Conference in 1911
a woman delegate handed in a resolution
from her branch to the effect that, in view
of the increase in insanity disclosed by the
report of the Inspector-General of Insane, a
hospital should be established for the early
treatment of incipient mental cases in order
to prevent the occurrence of insanity where
possible. This was included in the party’s
platform at the instance of the present Min-
ister for Health, who now has the establish-
ment of such a hospital under consideration.
Since 1911 various Ministers have been
approached by various women, who have
had suggestions to make in regard to mental
deficiency generally, and there are at the
present time two bills in process of being
drafted with reference to this subject. Now
a band of women at the instance of the
Women’s Reform League has taken the mat-
ter in hand, the objective being the estab-
lishment at the Medical School of a clinic of
psychiatry, to provide for the study of all
subjects relating even remotely to insanity.
They demand that the medical student be
put in a position to learn how to prevent
nervous disorders due >to shock or strain
from developing into actual insanity; how
to save to the community its greatest social
asset — brains.
The Profession is indignant at such im-
pertinence, and washes its hands of all
responsibility in the matter. “Something
might have been done,” doctors say, “if a
pack of meddlesome women had not inter-
fered—but now !” Words fail them !
About 40 years ago a Commission was
appointed in England to consider, among
other the possibility of preventing
insanity in many cases by timely treatment
and proper cate; also the relation between
insanity and crime-— apropos of which one
recalls some remarks made by Judge Gor-
don in an Adelaide court recently. A very
interesting report was drawn up by Dr.
Brudenell Carter, a well-known physician
and the author of several delightfully-written
books. It contained recommendations for
the amendment of Lunacy Laws so as to
permit of early preventive treatment being
applied to cases of incipient insanity; also
recommendations that instruction should be
given in medical schools on such subjects. This
report was forwarded to Parliament —and
pigeon-holed. Several years later Dr. Cyril
Maudesley doiiated £30,000 for the build-
ing of a public hospital which was to provide
the kind of treatment advocated in Dr.
Carter’s report, and to enable medical stu-
dents to take post-graduate courses in men-
tal disorders. This money lay idle for many
years because the law as it stood precluded
its being used as specified: it was practically
illegal to prevent insanity. At length a com-
promise was arrived at, and instead of the law
being effectively amended the money was
handed over to the London County Council
and a hospital built which is administered
by the Lunacy Board, of Control- —the equiv-
alent to our Inspector-General of Insane, it
is still necessary in England, as in N. S.
Wales, for a patient who may become
insane .through neglect to come under the'
Lunacy Department before he can receive
preventive treatment. The authorities must
be assured that the horse is well and truly
stolen before they will allow the stable door
to be locked.
At intervals since that first conference the
question of preventive treatment for insanity
has been brought before various medical
congresses in Australia and Great Britain;
and at many recent congresses strong reso-
lutions have been carried concerning it. And
the net result has been a fanning of
existing interest on the part of the always-
enthusiastic neurological section of the
8.M.A., arid the awakening- (perhaps) of a
spasmodic interest on the part of one or two
isolated members outside that section. So
it would appear that the “strong resolutions
are likely, to continue indefinitely—unless
the public insists upon their being carried
info effect. So, as the men are all in the
trenches, women must include this in their
war work-: it -directly-affects-Ahe sons -and
brothers we sent out, and who are coming
back now victims of shell-shock —dearly-
loved wrecked and shattered things who may
never be the same again, but who might
be saved by kindly treatment. And those
among us whose men were reported as hav-
ing shell-shock and later reported “missing”
wonder in anguish of soul liow many of them
have slipped overboard from hospital ship
on their way home. We see our boys,
who have given up brilliant prospects for the
privilege of risking their lives, discharged on
half pensions—or without any pensions—by
the Medical Board. That they are quite un-
lit for work does not constitute any claim
for consideration in the eyes of the A.A.M.C.,
whose members realise a man is wounded
when they see a shattered limb, but cannot
understand that he may be much more seri-
ously wounded when the injury is more
deeply seated and less obvious, and that he
may be in far greater need of care than if
he had lost his eyesight or limbs.
Women are the guardians of the future
race, and even those of us to whom mother-
hood is denied cannot escape this responsi-
bility : tee must care for other people's chil-
dren. These men are the potential fathers
of future generations. We have the right
to demand on this, if on no other ground,
that they shall get the right kind of care
and treatment, and to insist that those who
assume the responsibility of treating them
shall have to demonstrate that they know
their business before they are registered as
being duly qualified to practise it.
UNE FEMME.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Of Course They Bomb Hospitals.
The futility of British outcries against the
Hun military policy of dropping bombs on
hospitals is exasperating. Of course the
Huns are air-raiding hospitals when and
where they can. Killing wounded soldiers
and the nurses whose business is to tend
them back to health is, indeed, pardonable
militarism compared with the Frightfulness
of shelling the beach of a seaside holiday
resort where hundreds of children are dig-
ging holes in the sand, or torpedoing passen-
ger ships for the sake of “moral effect.”
Shocking inhumanity is all in the game as
the Huns play it, and all expression of art-
less British horror at such tricks has been
pathetically foolish for years past. The Ger-
man nation at large has been brutalised by
its preceptors, as well as by its military
system, for the last half-century, and the
German everywhere is now a Hun at heart,
sneering inwardly at humanitarian criticism
of the Frightfulness which boldly proclaims
itself a means to the proud Hunnish end.
The easy doctrine that “ all Germans are not
brutal” seems intended to suggest that most
of them are fully up to the level of civilisa-
tion among the Allies —that the average non-
combatant Hun is a genial soul refined by
education in arts, sciences or business;
especially business. On the really honest
folks who preach this dangerous doctrine
the lessons of the War have been wasted.
The nation can be judged by its medical
men —-a class of educated non-combatants
whose profession is associated in every
country with good manners. And for an in-
stance of how the Hun medical gentleman falls
short of our ideal we can turn to the book
prepared at the end of the first year of War
by a Belgian scholar, Jean Massakt, Vice-
Director of Sciences in the Royal Academy
of Belgium. The 3rd chapter, treating of
“The German Mind, Self-Depicted,” starts
with a quotation from the Kaiser’s Speech
from the Throne on August 4, 1914: —
It is not the spirit of conquest which urges, us
forward ; but we are animated by the inflexible
determination to retain the position in which God
has set us, for ourselves and for all the generations
to come.
From page 341 we learn how a body of edu-
cated Huns graced the position in which
God had placed them : —•
Many hundreds of German Army surgeons met in
congress during the Easter holidays of 1915 in
Brussels. On the last day of the congress, Wednes-
day, the 7th April, a banquet was held, on the pre-
mises Of the Palais de Justice. On the Thm-sday
morning it was discovered that the surgeons had left
souvenirs behind them; they had. .. .chosen for their
purpose the most beautiful halls of the Palais.
As regards the mentality of their fighting
forces: —-
When in August and September, 1911, we were
told that the Germans were amusing themselves by
depositing ordure in their beds, we refused to believe
in such perversion. But a walk through Eppeghem,
Sempst, and Weerde was enough to enlighten u 5....
Not -only in the grocers’ shops had they delighted
themselves by mixing snuff with the butter and
tacks with the cloves, and pepper with the flour, but
all the bedding bore the malodorous traces of their
visit. Let it not be imagined that this mania of
beastliness is peculiar to the common soldiers. The
officers who spent the night of 19th August, 1915, at
Cortenburg, between Louvain and Brussels, were in-
fected by the same Kultur. In a certain house they
carefully laid the table in the dining-room, without
forgetting the r serviettes, and then deposited a sou-
venir on every plate. ' In another house in Corten-
burg they chose as a receptacle the tall hat of the
householder. In the chateau of Malderen (Brabant),
having taken all that pleased them and broken the
rest into small pieces, they opened a card-table,
deposited their excrement there, and carefully closed
it again.
These historical facts are offered to the con-
sideration of people in Australia who con-
tinue to apologise for German outrages in
war with the argument that, war is a brutal
thing, anyhow, and German “thoroughness”
in brutality is merely evidence of an honest
German will to win. Is it possible to imag-
ine a congress of Australian army surgeons
wantonly defiling a town hall in "an enemy
city?. Or to suppose that a little party of
superior British officers would enclose their
excrement in an elegant card-table with the
view to shocking the lady of the house next
time, she opened the piece of furniture? Or
to picture a group of Australian majors per-
petrating the dining-table outrage? To
accept the Germans as our equals in civilisa-
tion is to libel the English-speaking world.
To condemn Hun military and naval ex-
ploits by the law of -common humanity in
warfare is to excite further ridicule from
“God’s -Chosen.” Of course the Germans
drop bombs on hospitals! We are fighting a
people whose very sense of humor is steeped
in filth,-and whose dream of GoD-ordained
triumph is a hideous nightmare.
The Job for the Soldier To-morrow.
If it was not clear before to Minister for
Repatriation Millen and others it probably
is now that in its broader aspects the ques-
tion of repatriating Australian soldiers is
closely bound up with the general problem
of Australian industry. If opportunities
for employment are reasonably numerous
when the real strain of repatriation begins,
the business of restoring the soldier to civil
employment will not be difficult. There
should be less trouble about it in Australia
than anywhere else on ,earth, for industrial
expansion is here a relatively simple mat-
ter. If Australia, instead of buying copi-
ously from outsiders, becomes addicted to
supplying the local market with goods, there
will be work for a lot more citizens than
those who come back in khaki. But if the
politicians decide to go on in the old rut,
repatriation can Pot possibly be anything
except a story of disappointment and waste.
Unfortunately there has been a much
greater tendency among politicians to throw
around hot-air promises about “giving
farms to soldiers” and “spending millions”
than to get down to the foundations on
which the future of the nation and inciden-
tally of the soldier must be built. So far
the work done by the Department has been
experimental. It could hardly be otherwise;
for practically all the men who have
returned to Australia are in some way sub-
normal. There are the men who have been
incapacitated by wounds or sickness. There
are the neurasthenics. There are those who
should 'never have gone away anyhow. And
apart from the actually maimed and debili-
tated there are the numerous non-triers,
On the whole, The Bulletin believes that
the Department is honestly struggling to
deal justly with these men. It has made
mistakes, but in the circumstances these
were inevitable. In certain directions, how-
ever, it is more than details that are wrong.
Thus the land-settlement side of the scheme
is radically unsound. To repatriate soldiers
by making mortgage-ridden serfs of them is
simply to court disaster. But apart from
this special aspect of the whole repatriation
scheme there is this consideration: that
when thousands of sound men come to be
returned to Australia, repatriation—which
boils down in the end to the man and the
job—will be very different from what it
looks like with the war-boom in full pro-
gress. At best the Government is only
fumbling along now. It may spend,
however, thousands a day on susten-
tation allowances and put hundreds of
men into jobs every week, but unless there is
absorption into permanent industries there
can be no genuine repatriation. What is
going to be done for the soldiers is only part
of the problem of what Australia is going to
do for herself. The time is about ripe for
the Federal Parliament to let the public, see
if it has any practical ideas on that subject.
The Income Tax—and Others.
It has been calculated by Knibbs in “The
Private Wealth of Australia” that the net
income of all persons in the Commonwealth is
£257,000,000 a year. The figures based on the
war-census cards are probably wrong, for
there is internal evidence of good, hard lying.
This paper finds it hard to swallow the
allegation, for instance, that only 381,000
people, companies and institutions in Aus-
tralia are earning £3 and over per week net.
But taking the figures, with a helping of salt,
they show that about £80.000,000 of income
comes each year within the ambit of Com-
monwealth income tax. And as the appro-
priation therefrom by the States and the
Commonwealth combined already runs to
£10,500,000, H. E. Pkatten, of N. S. Wales,
warned the Senate the other day tha,t there
was little hope of making up the huge bud-
gets looming ahead out of income tax. In a
general way Pkatten was right. Income
taxation works in a particularly subtle way.
It is well within cold fact to say that 75
per cent, of the £10,500,000 taken from the
£80,000,000 is in turn collected from non-
payers of the tax in a direct form. The limit
of income tax would, be hard to reach in
the case of trading concerns with which it
becomes part of the charges of production
or distribution. In the case of earners of
fixed incomes, however, the limit of tolera-
tion would be easy to decide. Their lot is
the hardest, for on them the tax falls
directly, and they help to pay the tax of the
richer individuals whose economic position
gives them the chance to pass on the hat.
The fact, then, is that every man, woman
and child in the Commonwealth pays income
tax; and the poorer classes pay the most.
The truth about this has not yet soaked into
the public mind; but it will some day. In
the interval this paper agrees with Pkatten,
though for different reasons, that new
sohrces of revenue will have to be tapped
by the Commonwealth. Unless this is done
taxation of the mass of the people will
become more than oppressive. Only the
vast quantity of borrowed money now thrown
about makes even the present taxation easily
'endurable. There is not far to look for a
new source, either. It is something more
than a scandal that property in Australia
escapes almost free, while raids of increas-
ing violence are made on the wages of the
people. There are freehold lands in the
Commonwealth of an unimproved value of
The land tax derived by the
Federal Treasury is £2.000.000. No coun-
try in the world can show any such injus-
tice to the general taxpayer as this, or any
such shirk. While the earnings of the weekly
wage earner are being surreptitiously cut to
the bone, this vast accumulation of wealth,
of which the greater part is held by a hand-
ful of people, is touched for about Id. per
annum for each £l. The economic literature
of every country shrieks in protest; and the
war shrieks it too.
The Price of Congestion.
The discussion about the high price of meat
in Sydney has drawn attention to the curi-
ous fact that N.S.W. is now a meat-import-
ing State —that is to say, the cattle and
sheep it brings from other States are more
than those it sends away. This is about
how matters stand :
Sydney (with its environs) is the only local
market of any size.
It isn’t handy to any great cow and jumbuck dis-
trict, so its meat has to come a long way.
It is growing out of all proportion to the rest of
the State. In 1871 it contained 2734 out of every
10,000 of N. S. Wales’s population. In 1891 it held
3386 out of every 10,000. Now it holds 4088. The
city population was 137,776 in 1871. Now it is
about 780,000. So the amount of meat that has to
come a long way has multiplied about fivefold since
1871. And on the average this extra meat has to come
a longer way.
It costs more per mile than it did to fetch the
creature. Higher railway' wages, bigger interest bills
and sundries make a difference.
A great part of N. S. Wales won’t send meat to
Sydney unless it heavily outbids Melbourne and
Adelaide, because a very large section of the State is
nearer to these cities than to their own city, and
naturally trades with them. This competition grows
more intense as the three cities grow.
If the population of Sydney was scattered over
three or four cities at three or four good har-
bors, instead of being forced, by the faking
of the railway policy, to herd in one huge,
sedfish, short-sighted metropolis, the food
would have, on an average, very many miles
less to travel. So congestion has to be paid
for like other diseases. Better means of
distribution may do something: the regula-
tion of prices may do something; but they
won’t make the remote bullock any nearer.
Education in Australia.
N.S.W. Education-Minister James artfully
drew a red whale (it was bigger than a her-
ring) across the track when speaking at the
recent Parkes celebration. This was the fish :
The same criticisms, the same prophecies of
failure, the same dire forebodings for the future of
the children, were launched at the [Education] Act
of 1880 as at the Act of 1866, and, strange to say,
in spite of the experience of the last 38 years, we
hear the same dirge to-day.
Well, without making a dirge, someone
might explain, on the birthday of the Parkes
Education Act, why N. S. Wales lags behind
in scholastic affairs. The usual test is the
proportion of children between five and 14
who can read and write. (Children under
five are excluded, because babies are born
illiterate. People over 14 haven’t necessarily
any connection with our school system; they
may have brought their complete ignorance
here with them.) And at the last six cen-
suses these results were shown :
Children (5 to 14) out of Every 10,000 Who
Could Read and Write.
1861: Tasmania, 6160; Westralia, 5179; S.A., 4973 ;
Victoria, 4851 ; N. S. Wales, 4263; Queens-
land, 4053. Average, 4757.
1871: Victoria, 6397 ; Tasmania, 6160; S.A., 5763;
Westralia, 5716; N. S. Wales, 5349; Queens-
land, 5116. Average, 5910.
1881: Victoria. 7853 ; S.A., 6956 ; Queensland, 6670 ;
N. S. Wales, 6458 ; Tasmania, 6160; West-
ralia, 6076. Average, 7061.
1891: Victoria, 8236; N. S. Wales, 7372; Queens-
land, 7236; S.A., 7206; Westralia, 6780 ;
Tasmania, 6704. Average, 7588.
1901: Victoria, 8526 ; Queensland, 7942 ; S.A.,
7790 ; Westralia, 7775; N. S. Wales, 7662;
Tasmania, 7620. Average, 7984.
1911: Queensland, 9269; Victoria, 9221; Westralia,
8982; N. S. Wales, 8907; S.A., 8761; Tas-
mania, 8632. Average, 9027.
Out of six chances, therefore, N. S. Wales
was below the Australian educational aver-
age six times; S. Australia, Westralia and
Queensland, each five times; Tasmania,
four times, and Victoria not once. Victoria
scored four firsts and one second ; Tasmania,
one first and one second; Queensland,
one first and one second; Westralia, S.A.
and N. S. Wales, one second apiece. N. S.
Wales has talked more about its Education
Act and its Parkes than most States have
done about their Acts and their Parkeses,
and a fourth place at the last official count
isn’t much to show for it all.
♦
Westralia, the State that Drove Four
Booms Abreast.
The situation of Westralia in this present
year of grace and war and slump is unique.
There has been nothing just like it before,
though other States have had.their experi-
ences. There have been immigration booms
which helped by reason of the money the
immigrants brought with them, and a de-
pression lias followed. There have been
land booms, after which the breakage has
been dreadful and the recovery long. There
have been gold booms, which rushed up
prices, created an abundance of coin, and
brought into existence a class of workers
and speculators who found it hard to adapt
themselves to other occupations when the
bottom fell out. And there have been dread-
ful borrowing and public-works booms.
And every generation of boomsters has held
that its boom wasn’t like any other boom,
but was the real solid thing that would last
for ever. Westralia’s supreme disaster was
that it had all its booms at once, and it is
now having all its bursts at once, with an
extra war-burst thrown in. Its gold boom
reached the top in 1003. Victoria, in the
glorious days when Bendigo and Ballarat
and Forest Creek were new, didn’t beat it
by much, and Victoria hadn’t a loan boom on
hand at the same time. As for N. S. Wales
and Queensland, their best was small dust
in the balance by comparison. Now the
Westralian gold-output has fallen heavily,
and is still doing it. The immigration boom
lasted from 1891 to about 1905. During
that time the net gain by arrivals was
greater than that of all the other States put
together. The subsequent drop was so
sudden, even before the war started, that the
net influx fell from 50.420 (1901 to 1905'
to 2758 (1906 to 1910). The land boom
was wonderful while it lasted. As for the
loan boom, there had never been anything
like it. The net public debt (debt, less sinking
funds) was £l7 os. 6d. in 1881; £3O ss. Bd.
in 1891; £65 10s. 4d. in 1900; and over
£ll6 per head in 1917. This is the world’s
best, with no war expenditure included in
the total. Now the loans in London have
stopped gave for renewal purposes. Loans
in Australia are only paper money, and even
for them the authorised interest rate has
been put up to the ruinous maximum figure
of 61 per cent. The paper money is of no
value for paying interest in London, and the
interest payable there in the metal that one
seldom sees nowadays is about £940.000 a
year. The revenue has dropped from
£5,356.978 in 1916 to (if it is possible to
judge by the nine months’ returns. already
in) about £4,000,000 for 1918. There has

never been anything like that drop for size
in proportion to the size of the revenue, and
in suddenness, on all the pages of Australian
history, and except when a 'Country was
over-run by an enemy it has scarcely been
paralleled in any other history. There have
been seven deficits in succession. The State
became so riotous by reason of its confidence
in its herd of simultaneous booms that even
in the year when its revenue per inhabitant
was the biggest it ever had and the biggest
in the world it spent more than it received.
It has shut the stable door very hard in the
unexpected absence of the horse, but still it
looks as if the shortage this year will equal
one-fifth of the outgoings. The railways
are paying worse than they did. And there
are two dreadful rocks ahead. In 1920 the
Commonwealth ceases to be liable for its
subsidy to the States of 255. per inhabitant
annually, and also for the special subsidy
granted to Westralia for 10 years, beginning
at £250,000 in 1911 and ending at £160,000
in 1920. The special subsidy will almost
certainly not be renewed, and the ordinary
all-round subsidy may, by reason of the war,
stop also. Tasmania, by the way, also
receives a special subsidy of £90,000 a year,
and when that stops the island will get a
shock. Still, its position looks a shade less
desperate than that of Westralia. What
will happen- to the big State which drove
four furious booms abreast, and saw them all
fall down at the worst possible time, no man
can tell. The banks have helped a lame
State over the stile in the past, but the banks
have already parted with every sovereign
they can safely spare to the Federal Govern-
ment. It is a situation that calls perhaps
fqr some sympathy and certainly for a
tremendous amount of hard work
economy.

Uncle Sam and the Submarine.
Held up on the new front from Soissons to
the Marne, the German began the'week with
an attack from Noyon to Montdidier, the
immediate object being to flatten out the
salient there and widen the front for the co-
operation of the army of Von Gai/lwitz
with that of the Crown Prince. If this
assault is seriously pushed on and the enemy
gets the elbow-room he is after, there wiil
be bloody days ahead in the valleys of the
Oise and the Orque. These are the natural
lines of advance to Paris. They were fol-
lowed by Von Kluck, and the fact of the
Kaiser’s heir being now nominally in com-
mand of the German left, combined with the
German’s persistence in trying to shove him-
self south from Noyon, is an ominous sign
that Ludendorff reckons he holds a
winning hand. The ground is not difficult.
To the invader such an advance would in
every way be preferable to facing the tre-
mendous job of breaching the French lines
at the Marne and outflanking the defence.
That trouble may draw nearer the capital
than it is to-day is further suggested by the
news that Paris has been converted into a
vast entrenched camp, and by Clemenceau’s
reference to the lines that are “growing
thinner and thinner.” However valiantly
the Allied armies may be standing their fiery
trial, there seems little doubt that the
quicker Brother Jonathan’s sons arrive the
better. Some of them are there in the
thick of it and are doing well; but it is
possible, and more than possible, that the
very gravest issues now depend upon the
race between the transport and the sub-
marine. Exactly what effect the submarine
is going to have on the effectiveness of
American intervention is, of course, a mys-
tery. According to Secretary of the Navy
Daniels, the doorway to France cannot be
shut. That is good to hear. But there is
nothing very good about the other news of
more submarine craft operating along the
American coast. On the face of it these
pests are a long way from being negligible.
So far as the campaign has gone this sum-
mer the position arrived at is that unless the
defence is materially strengthened and soon,
the army of France will be fighting for the
national life in a more real sense than ever
before. “Everything now depends on
America,” says Lloyd George. Probably
that means : “Everything depends on beating
the submarine.” And the test of how much
it is beaten will be the number of American
troops landed in the vicinity of Foch —not
obscure statistics about something else.
Meanwhile the German is tackling his con-
tract with grjm thoroughness.
Dope.
“0.K.”: When I find the public swallow-
ing the poisonous piffle offered to us by the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, I turn to
one or other of the prophetic letters from
Keith Murdoch, written months ago. As
soon as the Versailles Council had taken
supreme control of military affairs, and long
before March 21, when the Huns delivered
their first desperate blow, Murdoch wrote
these warning words of wisdom
It will be well to remember throughout the year’s
campaign that the Allied armies in the West will
have to bear a far greater weight than ever before.
Do not be afraid when news comes through of
reverses; do not quail, when the enemy’s claims
reach into scores of thousands of prisoners and many
guns. For in such battles losses are inevitable. Our
defences have never been highly organised, either on
the British Front or on the French. Vast improve-
ments have been made since Kerensky’s collapse, but
they are still such as will necessitate strategic retire-
ments. With all their wealth of cement block-houses,
concrete gun emplacements and scientific entrench-
ment the Germans went back time and again before
our thrusts. The Australian soldier is convinced that
the German attack cannot be so strong as that of
the British in Flanders last year. Our men do not take
too seriously Fritz’s punching power. But by due sacri-
fice and repetition of blows, Hindenburg will be able
to take prisoners and storm positions. Already
his men are showing themselves picked for the
Western fighting. . . .Behind these stalwarts there
have been distributed the greater part of Germany’s
1919 class—her class of youngest sons. And so it
is to be a massacre of youth. No wonder that the
rumbling of discontent in Germany against the offen-
sive—the steady muttering of the strikers’ catchword
—“No attack in the West” —dies slowly. Germany
groans and stumbles under the whip of her own
militarism. But it goads her on. It is 'one of
those responsibilities which, once accepted, must be
carried to the end.
It hurts one to read that “our defences have
never been highly organised,” whereas a
wealth of labor and scientific endeavor is ex-
pended on German defence. Nevertheless
the warning of what must be expected, and
the exhortation to keep a stiff upper lip
when the inevitable trouble came, has had a
tonic effect on one reader, anyhow. If was
anti-depression medicine, to be taken when
required. The stuff the Sec. for the Colonies
lias befen sending is just dope—dope that
creates pleasant illusions for the moment if
you are silly enough to take it, and leaves
horrible depression behind it. The unreason-
ing optimism of men in authority is as
morphia to the national morale. Thusfar
the errors in the Kaiser’s promises have been
mere trifles compared with the foolishness of
official predictions on the Allies’ side. The
Huns have not had to bear the strain
of frequent shocking disappointments. We
have had to bear so many of them that our
muscles of mental endurance are splendidly
developed. But that is no argument in favor
of continuing to pile straws on the camel’s
back.

“Homespun”: A remark worth considering
was made to the Inter-State Commission
while_ it was inquiring in Melbourne into
the high cost of clothing: a merchant mur-
mured that “the prejudice against local
tweeds had broken down.” Whereupon the
trade concurred, and the public with mild
enthusiasm approved. But so far no one has
mounted a soap-box to demand that the
breakdown be made permanent. The preju-
dice existed because it was fed and fattened
by the interests of a group of importers and
retailers; the present breakdown is only due
to the war-time dearth of shipping. When
the ship famine became real, the trade fell
over itself to place orders with the local
mills—the same mills which were compelled
a few years previously to beg for orders, so
that a big Australian industry might escape
the scrapheap. It is well to remember when
the daily complaint is made that the mills
are unable to execute awaiting orders, that
the output was more than sufficient when the
imported tweeds were available. One re-
tailer’s purchases of local goods jumped 200
per cent, in three years, not because of a
desire to help the local industry, but, as one
witness moaned, because “the war had forced
firms to make larger purchases of local
materials.” And that they will return to the
foreign goods as soon as they can is quite
clearly indicated by the fact that an im-
porter, who had placed a large local order,
destroyed every mark and brand that pro-
claimed the origin of the goods. In view of
all this there is plainly only one thing to do
if we want to keep this trade—put on a
duty that will do its job. If we don’t want
to keep the trade, then I can only presume
that we don’t want to pay our war debts.
Which will be very awkward for quite a lot
of people who at present are taking no in-
terest in the matter.

“E.F.11.”: “T. Pallida” says (B. 30/5/’l8)
that “no guarantee of even reasonable free-
dom from risk qf disease is afforded by any
system of woman-examination.” Some
years ago the Thursday Island pearling
fleets migrated to the Aru Islands in the
Dutch East Indies. Eight schooners, one
steamer and 115 luggers, with the launches,
etc., made up the fleet. Dobo was the lay-
up and pay-off station. When we went up
first the population of the town consisted of
two Dutchmen and a few colored people.
We took up 1500 and soon another couple
of thousand arrived, including a contingent
of 104 Jap girls who came to practise the
oldest profession and help the pearlers
spend their big money. Very s6on we had
trouble. The Red Plague was raging, and
many a good diver went out through it and
the deep water. The heads of the fleets
held a confab. Result: A visit to the
Dutch conitrolleur and a proposal—the
pearlers to build a hospital and pay a doctor
to be appointed by tlie Dutch authorities.
The first week the scheme was in operation
Jap girls squealed and yelled as the little
Javanese police dragged them to the hospi-
tal, and their menfolk scowled and mut-
tered. But the lot finally got there. The
girls who had the trouble were kept in the
hospital till pronounced right. Next week
the girls went without much squealing, and
after a month or so they made no secret of
their liking for the system- To people who
had no experience the result was wonderful.
In a few months the trouble had died out
to practically nothing. At the first there
were 17 “boarders” at the hospital; after
three months it was reduced to an odd case.
Everything may be as “T. Pallida” says,
and infection may dodge the medical man
once or twice, but let the inspection be done
regularly, and —well, there is the Dobo ex-
perience to for itself.
“Kopai” : The price-fixer is a guileless and
simple soul. The outcome of the Board’s
latest brain-wave is the fixing of the profit-
margin on certain staple lines at 20 per
cent., the wholesaler’s invoice being the evi-
dence of the retailer’s good faith and the
basis upon which the Board’s inspectors will
judge his regard for the law. Now, some
of these last-fixed commodities are up 300
per cent, within the last year or two; and
goods purchasable at 2d. per lb. in 1916 are
worth 6d. to-day. But plenty of far-seeing
traders carry stocks of the 2d. purchase of 1916.
Under the present decree their selling price is
24d. retail; 2gd. wholesale. The wholesalers,
being importers and with only real invoices to
show, of course are not selling. The re-
tailers? Well, can you imagine any street
where the same line of goods was being
retailed at 2Jd., 3Jd. and so on up to 6cL or
7d., according to its date of purchase by'the
retailer, especially when the article is not a
perishable one and the 1916 brew is undis-
tinguishable from the 1918 one? Can you
imagine any body of retailers being such
born fools as to try it? Yet the Board in its
innocence presumes that they will. What
does the retailer do? Why, sell at 6d. or
7d., of course. How? Oh, tut, tut! The
retailer who could not scamper through a
fool regulation like that ought to be out of
a trade that needs brains, and into a
Government department spinning red-tape
or fixing prices! That’s the tragedy of this
price-fixing: it is forcing hundreds of for-
merly reputable traders to become rogues, it
is costing the country very large sums in
salaries, fees, etc., and the public gains in
the end—nothing.
If these “honors” that come from England
were conferred upon any intelligible plan
they would be less entitled to disrespect. But
nobody has yet discovered any method in
the madness. At the best politicians use
them as sops and bribes. Only one man
can get a Chief Justice’s job; but two or
three can be engineered into a title, lest they
should turn unfriendly towards the political
persons in authority. Justice Hodges is a
K.B. This is presumably for service on the
Victorian Bench. But have his services
been any more faithful than those of A. H.
Simpson, who lately retired from the N. S.
Wales Bench? If the honor is given be-
cause of judicial eminence, why has no title
ever been given to any judge of the more
eminent High Court Bench? (Griffith and
Barton got theirs before they went up.) If
eminence in the profession brought Mit-
chell, K.C., his K.C.M.G., why is Knox,
K.C.. merely a small C.M.G.? Is it because
to his eminence as a lawyer he added valu-
able service as a Red Cross Commissioner ? Big-
joiin Forrest has alone received a peerage : is
bluff, vain old Bigjohn the most eminent
man that Australian politics has produced?
The point has almost been reached when one
of these titles, instead of being an honor,
must be regarded as prima facie evidence
of either bribery or attempted bribery—an
effort mostly on the part of cynical poli-
ticians to make things up to somebody for
not having given him something else, or, in
the worst cases, a deliberate purchase of
political support in a crisis.
“Taranaki” : The news having filtered in
to Australia that the M.L. National Effici-
ency Board has recommended the Dominion
Government to prohibit the export of all
timbers, there has been horrible consterna-
tion in Australian cowfat quarters; for most
of the butter put up in the Commonwealth is
packed in white-pine boxes. This white
pine is shipped from M.L., and there is
certainly nothing better for the purpose. But
there may be something as. good or good
enough ; and Australia ought to have got to
work long ago to find it. White pine is so
generally useful that it has been slogged into
and cut at such a pace that, a couple of years
ago, M.L. woke up suddenly to the fact that
within another 10 years the supply would be
about exhausted and its own cow-cocky be
without pine boxes. Consequently for a year
or more there has been an agitation on the
part of the dairying people to stop export by
imposing a prohibitory duty, thus reserving
supplies for home use. Those concerned in
this matter in Australia have been well
aware of what was doing, and it was their
business to look out for a substitute. Instead,
it became known a month or so ago that an
Australian syndicate had secured a big tract
of timber country in the Dominion contain-
ing millions of feet of the coveted wood.
That of course set the cockies off stronger
than ever, and the recommendation to bar
export is a reply to the syndicate's grab. To
retaliate by stopping supplies of Australian
coal, which do not show signs of quickly
failing, and which M.L. has not got, is a
Hunnish sort of idea that will not appeal to
many outside the timber trade. Australia’s
proper remedy is to get busy and develop its
own timber supplies.
Justice Heydon, who has been appointed
President of the N. S. Wales Board of
Trade, will himself undertake (with the
help of a couple of members) the inquiry
into the cost of living with a view to fixing
the minimum wage ; and thereafter no arbi-
tration or wages board award may disregard
the Board’s finding. For the rest the Judge,
who will retain his job on the Arbitration
Court, will probably leave most of the Board
bf Trade proceedings to the Deputy, J. B.
Holme. But this inquiry alone will keep
the old Judge jumping. As, owing to the
importing and non-manufacturing policy,
the cost of most things is fixed, either wholly
or in part, by people outside, and the cost
of bringing these things here is also fixed
by people outside, and these people shove
the prices up without notice, the whole busi-
ness looks like counting 10 crows on a dead
tree; by the time the count is finished nine
old crows have left or 16 new crows have
arrived.
After all. the Federal Government
probably made a mistake when it wouldn’t
allow a Socialist delegate to go off to Russia
to find out what manner of things are being
done there. Michael Zadorosky, a well-
known Russian Socialist settled at Wallum-
billa (Q.), who did manage to get to Russia
to join in the great emancipation, writes
back to his neighbor, James Leahey, an
account of what he finds
My worst forebodings are turned to facts. It
seems to be a horrible nightmare.- The worst descrip-
tion of events in Russia pales before the reality. In
no period of autocracy was Russia subjected to such
callous brutality as she is now in the reign of
Socialism. Liberals caught in the act of condemning
Socialists' regime are torn to pieces by the ruthless
mob of beasts. In the day tune passers-by are
stopped by bands of robbers and stripped—in the
main streets of the big towns. Bands of peasants
and deserters attack homesteads, kill owners, rob
everything and burn buildings.... The helplessness
of a man here is maddening. An honest man is like
one on a little island with the tide coming up. You
can do nothing but wait for the waves. The horror
of it all drives hundreds to suicide.
Meantime, Germany looks on and smiles at
its work. With the Hun nothing matters
but the end.
From W. L. Baillieu, Melbourner
The letter of your Melbourne correspondent
“Johanna” of 27th May stating that my son, “young
Jim Baillieu, ex-Grammar youth, went away last
year with the gunners, and has been back here for
some months with nerves,” and that he “ought to
thank God his name is not Jim Brown,” is cruelly
untrue. My son Jim has pot “been back here for
some months with nerves.” He has not yet been
allowed to enlist, and I will not permit him to join
up until he is 19., It was his brother Tom—an ex :
Grammar youth—who went away last year with the
gunners. He “has not been back for some months” ;
he is now a flight-lieutenant fighting in France.
“Johanna'” has apparently founded her mis-state-
ments on the fact that my second son, Lieut. Harry
Baillieu, M.C., also an ex-Grammar youth, is back
from the war. 1-Ie was two years fighting in France,
and gained his Military Cross af’the battle of Lagni-
court. The Medical Board examined him only a few
weeks ago and pronounced him unfit owing to heart
trouble for return to service at present. He is now
in hospital, having been operated on for acute appen-
dicitis. The above facts will, I am sure, convince
you that your correspondent’s letter is, to put it
mildly, a gross slander on my son Jim, and by its
conjoined untruth -may reflect on two of his three
soldier-brothers, Tom and Harry. I do not believe
The Bulletin' stands for this sort of thing, and I
feel sure you will be glad to publish this letter.
The Bulletin regrets having published the
inaccurate paragraph complained of by Mr.
Baillieu, and unreservedly accepts his state-
ment of the facts. It never had the smallest
inclination to reflect on the courage of young
Jim or young Harry, or young Tom either.
The point it wanted to make was just this:
A Baillieu, if he suffers, say, from shell-
shock, may be able to get home; an unknown
Brown, without influence, may not be able
to. Yet the Defence Department proposes
to pillory youngsters by publishing their
names if they break down on the field and
are charged with cowardice. As “Johanna”
said, “brave boys for the time being un-
hinged are subjects for sympathy rather than
for censure.” As it proves, no Baillieu has
come home with “nerves.” But if he 1 had
done so this paper would not cast a stone at
him. It regrets that other boys can’t come
home—or, at any rate, can’t get the rest they
ought to have from the dreadful strain. And,
though it hasn’t been asked to say so, it is
sorry if it has hurt the feelings of either of
the two Baillieu boys—or their father. Any
man with three out of four boys at the Front
deserves all that consideration.

KATINKA.
Returning on the wedding day
Of his once’fond and true Katinka,
Young Ivan found her vowed away
To Strogoff, an official “stinker,”
Whose former wife (reported dead)
Had borne, till she no more could bear ’em,
His brutai taunts, and then had fled
And sought a Turkish pasha’s harem.
Katinka saw her sad mistake
When told of intercepted letters.
And with her “boy” conspired to break
Her fatal matrimonial fetters.
In order that the maid might fool
Her husband, yet be strictly proper,.
She motored off to Old Stamboul
With dear old Thaddeus T. Hopper.
Sweet purity reigned in her breast;
She never courted hugs or kisses
When hopefully they went in quest
Of Boris Strogoff’s former missus.
And T. T. Hopper played the game;
No thought uneircumspectious had he—
But oh! his lawful partner came
And found tlie Russian girl with Thaddy.
Then all the fat was in the fire:
The old, old stagey situations;
The bouncing matron filled with ire,
The sudden rush of complications,
The truth in mystery concealed
Till circumstances cleared the fog off,
And from the harem was revealed
A Turkisli-trousered Mrs. Strogoff!
When Ivan claimed Katinka’s hand , f
The scene was in a Paris cafe;
New banns of marriage now were banned;
Plump Mrs. Hopper, sweet as taffy,
Took Thaddeus once more in tow—-
All guiltless proved he stands before us.
The curtain fell on all the co.
United in a final chorus.
Fortune is. going to smile upon “Katin-
ka,” the musical play produced at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s last Saturday. Its wealth
of; music, though without any particular
character of its own, is up to ordinary
comic-opera standard; the book is fairly
amusing; the ball of gaiety is kept rolling,
and the three scenes and many dresses are
more or less beautiful. Coming after “Bing
Boys” it seems twice estimable. It shines a
good deal on its own, and more by compari-
son. Of course the orchestra was too loud
on the first night. No conductor has mas-
tered the art of so subduing solid music at
Her Majesty’s as to adapt it to the unusual
shape of the auditorium. But the effect of
excessive noise has doubtless been toned
down somewhat by this time, and the song
words .presumably go for more than an
occasional glimmer of meaning.

The first “corroboree” of the Actors’ Asso-
ciation of Australasia, held on Sunday night
in Sydney Criterion, was a happy social
occasion made notable by a strong perform-
ance of Lord Dunsany’s tragic one-acter, “A
Night at an Inn.” Frank Harvey (pro-
ducer) was The Toff who thought of all
things but one ; Dobson, Hughes and Fern-
side his three frightened seamen accom-
plices; Nicolas, Moore and Bishalt the three
pursuing Indian priests; J. B. Atholwood
the god Klesh, who, w’hen his priests
have been murdered, one by one, while
trying to recover his stolen ruby eye,
miraculously appears in the inn. puts the
eye back into his jade forehead, and then calls
tire robber-murderers forth in turn to be
strangled. The curtain fell with The Toff
going out hopelessly into the windy dark, say-
ing in a flat, hopeless voice, “I never thought
of that!” It was an artistic treat, and the
theatre-full of guests thundered their appro-
val. Playgoers who had not the luck to be
invited missed one of the most intellectual
Australian productions of recent years. The
Bulletin cannot imagine an audience that
Dunsany’s art would not hold. The play
should be done again—if not in the ordinary
way of business as a curtain-raiser, then at a
special patriotic performance.

FIRST CORROBOREE OF THE ACTORS’
ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALASIA,
AT SYDNEY.
Lord Dunsany's “A Night, at an Inn.” The
Idol of Klesh (Jimmy Athol wood) claims
his stolen ruby eye.
“General Post,” at Melbourne Royal, will
have further opportunity to strengthen its
hold on Australian understanding. The gentle
comedy isn’t witty, but the plain, wholesome
humor of the story appeals to everybody in-
terested in the study of snobbery. Snobbery
as it appears in the English home of Baronet
Styan, and is frankly confessed to by Lady
Ethel Morrison, seems not as truly awful as
we get it in the naicest Australian Red Cross
circles, where nobody ever owns up to it.
The performance of “General Post” improves,
but there is still plenty of room for Lizette
Parkes to remember that the play starts in
1911 and finishes in an indefinite period
known as “After the War.” She might note
the flight of time more carefully. Also her
stage brother might be less convulsed by his
poor little joke about the “shower of mul-
lets.”

“Carmelita” is hardly a feast of music
and a flow of soul, but Melbourne Palace
supporters like it. Its strongest claims to
indulgence in the eyes of this paper are its
generally spotless behavior and its local
origin. Also it appeals for favor on its
vocal side. But the personalities don’t as a
rule sparkle. Maud Miles (Carmelita) con-
ducts herself with necessary gladness, but
Dorothy Hastings is damned by a wintry
spirit, and Whitehead has a terribly gloomy
manner. Far from suggesting a jaunty free-
booter, Whitehead might be a drummer for
a Bible Society spending a miserable even-
ing in fancy dress. ,
At Melbourne King's to-morrow will be
the last night of the absorbing story of Chil-
cote and his cousin Loder and the lady who
decides to treat them as one and the same
husband in the sight of the world. Guy
Bates Post will lay aside his “nerves” after
Friday, and the good dawg Huskie will cease
to scratch himself in the limelight, unless,
indeed, the trusty canine has a part in “The
Nigger,” due on Saturday. Melbourne is ex-
pecting great dramatic things of “The
Nigger,” and the fact that the play can run
only 10 nights ensures good booking for the
remainder of the season.
“The Million Dollar Girl.” at Melbourne
Tivoli, is going for all she is worth. Now-
adays, when Celia Ghiloni comes along with
a suit-case and sings of a wandering one who
thinks of returning home, the words of her
refrain are projected on the scenery, and a
tuneful section of the audience takes the hint.
Melbourne Bijou’s latest misdemeanor is
entitled “Roley Poley,” but it has no resem-
blance to its famous namesake. Its nearest
relative would be a cream-puff if the puff
were thinner: it shows the quality of the
revue whose only meaty thing is an under-
clothing joke. It is a change of air to turn
to Phil Newbury and 4my Murphy, who are
still warbling soulfully in the first half of the
programme. Bessie Lester supplies the jar-
gon of Noo Yark’s East side and “gets” the
house, and there is a new lassoist named
Lockwood who can go a couple of loops
better than the average expert.
Marguerite Clark turns to another page of
“Babs Diary,” at Hoyt’s, Melbourne, this
week, and relates the damsel’s adventures
with £250 a year. Babs is delightfully un-
real in her use of the money, but the
winsome art of the actress gives Babs’s
achievements an exquisite charm. The
second feature, “The Thing We Love,” is a
soaring tragedy which reaches the noblosi
altitudes.
The latest ghostly visitor at Melbourne
Majestic is Bessie Barriseale in “Those Who
Pay.” Bessie is a poor girl who nourishes
a humble affection for a lawyer, only to find
that a soul like a violet is hardly an asset
with some types of men. More tumultuous
feelings surge in a free adaptation of Robert
Hichens’s “Garden of Allah.” Helen Ware is
the lady in the case, and her dark, upheaving
passion in the middle of a sandstorm is one
of the finest heartquakes ever given in the
films.
** * *
There is just one point of marked origi-
nality about “The Price of Pleasure,” which
is being given its first Australian trial by
the Anderson co. at Adelaide Majestic: the
wicked baronet (Fitzherbert, of course)
butchers his legal adviser (Stanford) for
giving an unfavorable opinion. The said
opinion is that a young Australian (Guy
Hastings) has a better claim to the title
and estates. (It is conceivable that as the
play was originally written the claimant
came from some other continent; as it is
locally produced, he bears the fine old Aus-
tralian name of Gilbert D’Arrnand.) Law-
yers generally hold most of the cards in
melodrama, but this melodrama does not
think much of them. When a junior
(Stephenson) takes up the running, the
baronet merely poisons him, with the aid
of a grandly unscrupulous she-villain
(Marie Dalton), and has a shot at burning
up the whole office. The rest is more con-
ventional. Ida Gresham is kidnapped and
shut up in a garret, where she meets and
rescues the secondary heroine (Gladys
Daly), who had lost her reason on seeing
the first crime; and so to the necessary
happy ending. The acting is more than
good enough.
“Daddy Longlegs,” at Adelaide Royal, is
a pleasant surprise, the sentimental side be-
ing brightened by the humor supplied by
Brampton and Clarice Hardwicke. Miss
Temple is her pleasant self. Waldron and
Miss Macdonell are easy and effective in
the leading parts, which make no great
strain on their powers; there is stronger
meat to follow. Business is big. The Taits
have given “Henrietta” and “Turn to the
Right” a return visit to the King’s, re-
opened foy the occasion. The men are
effective, but one misses Lizette Parkes; on
the other hand, Margaret Calvert does a
brilliant feat in jumping from the saintly
peach-jam mother to a much better fashion-
able widow than the previous widow was.

“8.R.” describes 40 minutes of it:—
A gas attack rings up the finest fireworks display
in this world, Fritz concentrates his artillery on
the sector. He pastes the front line and supports
with Jack Johnsons, coal-boxes, minnewerfers, whiz-
bangs, 5.9 howitzers and everything he can use in
an effort to locate the cylinders and burst them so
that we and not he may have the benefit of them.
Minnewerfers break up the barb-wire entanglements
and send them over in a hail. A nose-cap screams
in and tears a great hole in the sheet of iron sup-
porting the parados. A 5.9 comes straight through
HIS DISTINCTION.

the sandbsigs and goes to rest under the fire-step
within a foot of where a man is crouching. Luckily
ls . a ' uf ‘ Machine-gun bullets whiz along the
top of the parapet, tearing open the bags and send-
mg down dirt in showers. A shell ricochets off a
tree and goes whining on its way. Duckboards,
equipment, sandbags and sheets of iron shoot 50ft. in
the air. The ground heaves under the concussion of
heavy shells, and the trench begins to look like 218
dogfights. A man crawls round the corner of the
traverse and dies at our feet. A runner, hurrying
through with a message from H.Q., drops like a
polled ox. An h.e. lands just above us and fills up
the trench. Deafened by the explosion and blinded
by smoke, with the stink of the acids in our nostrils
we struggle out from under half a ton of soil which
a moment before formed the parapet. A screaming
in the air warns us another shell is coming. We
drop flat, hugging the side of the trench. It lands
above us with a force that jars us. A moment of
suspense follows; but the explosion never comes!
Another dud, thank God! There are now only two
of us left.' We take turns at observing. A whiz-bang
carries away our brazier and the coke decorates the
landscape. That means no hot food or drink to-
morrow. My water-bottle springs a leak; it has
been struck by shrapnel. Meanwhile the gas drifts
away towards Fritz like a great white fog. From his
front line Verey lights, magnesium flares, star shells,
rockets and red and green flares spout in thousands,
showing up No Man’s Land as bright as day. A
powerful searchlight sweeps the sky, never twice
from the same spot. A heavy barrage thrashes back-
wards and forwards through the gas, dispersing it.
Word goes through to stop our artillery, and a little
later Fritz gives it up also. But he is very nervous,
and the tornado breaks out intermittently, only to
die down again when he finds there is nothing doing.
“Kali” ; I’m sorry to beat Mr. Webster’s
best authenticated record of postal inactiv-
ity, but here it is. A letter posted in Syd-
ney on May 26, 1892, reached its Vic-
torian destination on May 26, 1918 —by a
strange coincidence exactly 26 years after
it had been posted. It was only a celebrated
Syrup circular, and evidently the postman
was feeling tired and threw it up in the
ceiling of the post office. There it was
found—a still stranger coincidence —by a
son of the man to whom it had been posted.
Mr. Webster can truthfully say that he has
ar least expedited the delivery of letters.

There was a thrilling sight in North
Adelaide one evening lately. The driver
of an electric tram-car coming in empty
from suburban Prospect somehow fell off the
car just after starting. The car buzzed along
on its own for more than two miles, over
points and past compulsory stops, without
the conductor, an easy-going soul, suspect-
ing that anything was wrong, apparently.
Meanwhile the motorman was giving chase
on another car, clanging its gong furiously
and decli ing likewise to stop anywhere. It
was a quaint sight. When the steep
descent to the river was reached, it is esti-
mated that the 15-ton runaway got up a
speed of about 35 miles an hour, and by
the Children’s Hospital it overtook a slower
car, fortunately nearly empty. There were
two cases of severe injury; but compared
with the slaughter there might have been it
was a wonderful escape.
“Dial-sight”: “Hamer’s” refer-
ence (B. 23/5/’18) to dogs
attached to the A.I.F. reminds me
of “Rags,” a Yorkshire terrier
who got his name from the elabo-
rate coat he wore at the time of
his involuntary enlistment. he
was-pinched out of the back of a
motor-car near Melbourne Town
Hall by a Billjim en route to em-
bark with the first convoy. “Rags”
landed with the First Division of
Artillery at Gallipoli and whilst
there narrowly escaped untimely
end by reason of an army order
that all dogs under suspicion of
being used to communicate with
Johnny Turk should be killed.
Eventually he went away with the
other Aussies at the Evacuation;
and in due course went to France
to do his bit. Last time I heard
of him he was in care of a farrier-
sergeant in the First D.A.C., and
was still guarding the column’s
rum ration. I’d like to hear that
“Rags” had come home safely and opened a
pub.

“Kerani” : One of the queerest by-products
of this war is the Chinese Labor Battalion
employed behind the lines. Their “uniforms”
cover a wide range, and their head-gear in-
cludes straw hats, felt hats, caps, tin hats
and sundries. Their boss is rather a swell,
in a tweed suit and decker, but he is seldom
seen. He has a kind of sergeant-major who.
does all the work, which is quite as it should
be in military matters. The s.-m gets them
out in the morning by blowing a horn, and
they fall in in a mob, all talking at the
top of their voices. He shouts himself
hoarse, and pushes them about and eventu-
ally they get into a rough line and start to
number off. When they get up to 40 or
so, some Chow mangles his number and the
whole lot break off and take to him. They
make it a personal matter, and the horn has
to be brought into use again. After five or
six goes the number reaches the end of the
line, and the s.-m. yells out the Celestial
equivalent of “form fours.” After perform-
ing a weird evolution they get into a sort of
column and shuifle off up the road all jabber-
ing. The s.-m. wears six chevrons on each
sleeve (upside down), and several stars and

crosses on his shoulders and chest. He de-
serves them all. They are partial to puttees,
but very few have the regulation kind. The
others improvise. One ingenious bird made
a pair out of an old rubber ground-sheet.
They come half-way up his thighs, and are
unique. These Chinese don’t live in their
tents —they live under them. They are very
frightened of the Boche raiders’ bombs, and
the camp is like a rabbit warren with the
tunnels they have made for shelters. All
the same, if a bomb is dropped anywhere
near the camp they rush out and tear up
the road in a mob —as often as hot towards
the scene of operations. They got as far as
our Major’s quarters—about half a mile up
the road—the other night, and opened up a
debate on War Aims or something. The
Major thought it was mutiny and reached
for his revolver. But his batman knew bet-
ter. He hurled an empty petrol-tin in
among then. I think some.of them are going
yet.

Either we are improving or our luck is
bettei*. 'On the last day of 1877 one out of
every 429 people in N. S. Wales was in
gaol; in 1887 one out of 437; 1897, one out
of 576 ; 1907, one out of 1947; and on
December 31 last only one out of every 1362.
And yet gaol seems a lot more pleasant place
than father must have found it. Down to
1896 it wasn’t easy to dodge punishments,
and irons and handcuffs, floggings and black
cells were all on the menu. Not a man has
been punished with irons or handcuffs or
floggings for the last four years; dark cells
and solitary confinement have been dis-
carded and the old time-wasting labor lias
been cut out. Actually in N. S. Wales the
new idea, seems to be that very few people
are any the better for gaol; and still a few
manage to creep in whom the English sys-
tem, for instance, would shut out. Sixty-
four out of every 100 people received into
gaol in N. S. Wales last year got there not
because they were wicked but because they
wepe poor—-in other words, because they
couldn’t pay a fine. In England it isn’t left
to the magistrate to say whether a convicted
person shall have time to pay or not: he
simply has to allow at least seven days
“provided that the convicted person has a
fixed abode within the jurisdiction of the
Court or in the absence of any other special
reason,” and the prison authorities reckon
that even this pushes too many inside the
walls. This matter and the faulty law which
still allows V.D. prisoners—many of them
women—to leave gaol want the Ma State’s
attention. Last year 37 males and 17
females had to be released though they were
not free from contagion; and (add this for
the benefit of M’s.P. who have their lunch
in town) one of the men was a cook.

Helen of Troy, Helen of Troy,
Walking the ramparts with Paris boy!
What did she wear

Of Greek mythological grace and joy?
Bitter blockade, bitter blockade,
Great Agamemnon about them made!
And a girl who was nice
No fancy price
For frills and anklets and fripperies paid.
Without pretence, without pretence,
Helen of Troy must cut down expense!
So she pared with skill
Her milliner’s bill,
Till Hecuba called her a girl of sense.
A modest gown of dead-leaf brown
She wore as she walked the fated town.

And the grey Fates noted the wonder down.
Shields arc broken and long spears shake.
Simple her dress for economy’s sake.
Simple and sweet,
But, when all complete,
It cost her fifteen guineas to make!

Four Sydney Professional Nurses testify to this Nerve Medicine, CLEMENTS TONIC
Because they have noted that in cases of Weakness after fever and operations and general ill-health, a rapid improvement follows its use.
NURSE L. BENNETT, who has her own private hospital, “Montone,” Ashbnrner
Street, Manly, N.S.W., writes the following letter: —
CLEMENTS TO±NIC LTD.
“From what I know of your medicine there is no need for sick people to say farewell to
good health.
“I have followed the nursing profession for 10 years, and I have observed the results of
various medicines on my patients, and I agree with others that Clements Tonic is a remark-
able good remedy for people who are affected with bad nerves, melancholy and insomnia. It
certainly has a curative power, and any delicate person could not do better than take it. When
exhausted it always gives me renewed strength. “(Signed) Nurse Bennett ”
NURSE O’SULLIVAN, Red fern and Parramatta, of 34 years’ constant nursing service
• in the above districts, writes that in her opinion Clements Tonic is a medicine
specially suited to constitutions weakened by illness. She writes:—
CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“I carried on my profession at Young Street, Redfern, for 25 years, and for the last nine
years at Parramatta.
“I have had a large number of sick people under my care, and it has been a pleasure to
recommend Clements Tonic. I knew it would give good results. My niece was rather run down
in health lately, but she is getting on splendid as the result of taking your medicine.
“(Signed) Nurse O’Sullivan.”
NURSE MARY ROE, 80 William Street, Paddington, sends her opinion of Clements
Tonic after 15 years’ professional experience.
CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“For many years Clements Tonic has been a great blessing to me. I take it when feeling
the least bit exhausted after the great demand on my services. I have followed my profession for
15 years, and have a very large professional clientele.
“I have recommended this medicine to my patients and others in cases of Neuralgia, Indiges-
tion and Bad Nerves. In my opinion there is nothing to equal Clements Tonic. I know of
instances where it has almost wrought a miracle in the health of many of my friends. Use it as
you wish. “(Signed) Nurse Mary Roe.”
NURSE E. H. HALL, 502 New South Head Road, Woollahra, N.S.W., writes ofi
Clements Tonic: “I recommend it to my patients in cases of Indigestion,
Dyspepsia and Acute Nervousness.”
This medicine is certainly one of the best Nerve Restorers possible for Invalids or
those whose systems feel the strain of arduous labors, especially in commercial life.
A few doses of this medicine works wonders.
NURSE HALL writes: —
“I cannot estimate the value of your medicine.
“Where my patients show symptoms of want of sleep, nervousness and dyspepsia I often
recommend it. My house would not be thoroughly equipped without it.
“Personally, I derive much benefit from a few doses of it when fatigued.
“(Signed) Nurse E. H. Hall.’*
Essentially the medicine for the invalid, or for those weak from overwork, fever or operations. It gives new life to the system, tones up the stomach, liver or nerves. Try it to-day.

A beautiful rule-bound official who is due
for promotion was discovered in a Sydney
tram last week. He was a ticket-inspector,
and he demanded that an armless soldier
who was a passenger should produce his
pass. The soldier told the beautiful official
who is due for promotion that he had his
pass in his pocket but couldn’t show it be-
cause the only hand he had was made of
wood. Whereupon the gentleman who is
due for promotion said, “Well, I’ll get it
myself,” opened the flap pocket of the sol-
dier’s tunic and examined the contents until
he found the scrap of paper he wanted! An
official with nerve like that shouldn’t have
to wait long for the. promotion either. He
is quite wasted examining tickets on a tram.

The Censorship has a new enemy looking
for its blood; not the newspaper editors this
time, but the farmers, especially of S. Aus.
The wheatgrowers’ rep. on the Australian
Wheat Board is Clement Giles, who only got
there after infinite trouble and has since
been shown that he is about as welcome
as a plague of bullants. Lately, in company
with Rees, M.L.C., Giles visited the Mallee,
and, addressing the farmers, informed those
interested persons of the commission paid to
the Australian wheat agents, the four agents
in London and others, and gave them other
information about their business. Giles’s
report to his principals was censored; and
now there are a few thousand farmers furi-
ously sniffing the air.
Hope springs eternal in the human beast.
Hence the Hun still expects to win.—Solo-

“Country Ped”: At the Easter Confer-

Union, a motion was carried, almost unani-

vised and that only essentials be preserved.
Naturally Director Frank Tate and Senior-
Inspector Burgess rushed to the assistance
of their adopted darling, though in the end
the former promised that a committee of
teachers and experts would be called to
report on the matter. Now what do you
think that report will be? Remember that
the teachers who will sit on the committee
depend on Tate and his experts for their :

aries. But if the Minister wants an indepen-

appointing a tribunal of recently-retired

Dear old Hobart, being so largely 60 or
thereabout, has been agitated again over the
age of consent. The other day a deputation
urged Attorney-General Propsting to raise
Miss Frailty’s age to 16, and he promised to
recommend that much to Parliament. The
next request was that the time for laying an
information against the seducer should be
extended to 12 months. Propsting agreed
to recommend six months; but he was flatly
against the suggestion that in these cases
there should be a jury of an equal number of
men and women, his objection being that it
was not reasonable to ask a mixed jury to
adjourn to a private room to discuss the
usual evidence. However, he put forward as
a fair proposition that no juryman under the
age of 30 should sit in these cases. But why
30? Why not 58?

“Carillon” : A bugle that did its best to be
a hero, and was actually incapacitated by
gunshot wound, has come
back to Ballarat. It re-
turned with Graham
Coulter, D. 5.0., formerly
lieut.-colonel of the
Eighth. Of solid silver,
it was presented in 1867
by “the ladies of Balla-
rat” to the old Ballarat
Rangers. The purchase
money was collected by
Lieut.-Colonel Greenfield,
then a lieutenant. When
the Rangers were dis-
banded it remained with
the bugler till he died,
and some years later
Lieut.-Colonel (Senator)
Bolton bought it from a
local shopkeeper in whose
window it was discov-
ered. Bolton was O.C.
of the Eighth in Egypt,
and it accompanied the
battalion and sounded
the calls. Then came
Gallipoli, where it was
more of a trophy than a
battle clarion. With
Coulter it went to France.
Except at a base buglers
are unheard there, so it
went silent to the battle-
field, and was not ren-
dered any more dumb
when a bullet removed
the mouthpiece and put
it on the retired list for
good. Its present job is being the nucleus
of a Ballarat War Museum.

“Wart”: The Lilydale (Tas.) Municipal

and got a dozen applications. After going
through them, the Bumbles narrowed the
applications down to two —a re-
turned soldier and a civilian. They
couldn’t decide between these, so,
instead of giving the returned sol-
dier the preference, they put the
two names in a hat. The civilian’s
was drawn. Lilydale, Tasmania.
Make a mental note of it. Associ-
ate it in your mind with moral
cowardice. Whenever the name is
mentioned think of a place which
had a chance to give recruiting a
lift, and sneaked away. Lilydale,
Tasmania.

“Mac” : I hope The Bulletin
will keep kicking at the vicious
habit of starting children off to
school while they are babies. In
my district, where I have practised
for 11 years, the hopeless igno-
rance of impatient mothers and the
acceptance of infants by the Educa-
tion Department is setting us well
on the road to general myopia.
Dr. Cohn in his statistics from
German schools years ago made
40 per cent, of the children there
shortsighted. I am of the opinion
that, as children in the main are
born longsighted, the persistent
forcing of the eyes to see at un-
natural short distances results in
over-stimulus to the blood-vessels
in the region of the eye, causing
the abnormal enlargement of the globe that
produces the myopic condition later. Hence,
as “M.D.” says (B. 23/5/T8), the frequency
of refractive errors and a spectacle-wearing
nation.
* * * * *
“Karee” : One lame reason given for requir-
ing officers to re-enlist as privates if they want
to return to the Front is that it will block
officers who have .been returned as incom-
petents or “services no longer required.” The
point that hurts most, though, is that birds
who have only recently declared war, or who
have hung on against superhuman odds for
ai couple of years, leave with the proved
men who are starting off scratch again. A
redeeming feature of the scheme is that after
the present commissioned camp-heroes have
been absorbed, returned officers will take
reinforcements over and return with in-
valids. That’s one grievance removed, any-
how. Formerly, when a private or n.c.o.
was due for promotion on the field, perhaps
after three years’ scrapping, he often had to
mark time, owing to the arrival of a starred
home-fire stoker.
"ONE TO BE TAKEN."
“My husband has got a buzzing in his ears
all the time. What do you suggest ,
doctor ?”
“Oh, let him go away by himself for a
month's holiday."
"Impossible-he can't leave his business!”
“Well, how about you going?"
“Skipper”: “One-of our balloons is miss-
ing” doesn’t always mean that some poor
cuss who spends the best part of his life
up in a swaying “sausage” has slipped his
moorings and floated gracefully over Fritz’s
lines, or has been punctured by an unfriendly
Gotha and disappeared in black smoke. It
usually does; and then the
sausage is missing for good. But
on the occasion of which I’m
thinking it was only missing for
one night. An Australian bat-
tery’s horse-line \yas alongside a
Balloon Section’s headquarters,
and had already helped itself to
enough wire-rope for breast-lines.
Now these Billjim gunners
w r anted a tarpaulin to keep the
harness and fodder dry, and they
had spotted one in the sausage
shop. The tarpaulin was duly
struck off the sausage section’s
strength and taken on the
strength of the A.I.F. Next
morning it was unrolled to re-
ceive the necessary camouflage,
and Billjim took two backward
somersaults —h e found he’d
pinched a brand-new balloon!
Another Australian battery didn’t
have a G.S. waggon at its horse-
lines and wanted one. The Guards’
regiment next door had one, and
the battery-drivers had their eye
on it. One dark night Billjim
gathered together his forebs and
removed the G.S. But when they
got outside the Guards’ gate the
waggon became badly bogged. Just
then a party of Guards under a
corporal returned from a fatigue
job. “Say, Corp.,” said one of
the “undisciplined mob,” “we’re
having trouble with our G.S.. The
horses have been shot and now
the t ——- thing is stuck in the
mud. Can. you give us a hand?” The
Guards turned, to and helped the Australians
home with Their waggon. Next morning
even that waggon’s, own mother wouldn’t
have recognised it.
* * * *
A man differs from a woman inasmuch as
he doesn’t take two other girls with him to
help him select a hat.—Solomon Malaprop.
At last England is looking with a cold eye
upon the Flossie who is as much an enemy
as the Hun that lays out Billjim or Tommy
with gas or shrapnel. At the end of March
a regulation was gazetted under the Defence
of the Realm Act declaring it an offence for
a woman who is. suffering from Y.D. to
chance communicating it to a soldier, or to
issue to Billjim or Thomas the usual invita-
tion. Nobody will gain more from this than
the boy with the wide-brimmed hat. He
hasn’t a home in England to go to when on
leave or waiting despatch to the Front; and
his free and easy habits and his big, generous
heart have made him the particular prey of
the pavement-dawdler. Now the Lady of
all the World (it is suspected that at the
start of the war the Hun bundled many of
her out of his country to do her worst else-
where) is liable to be asked to step inside
for a week for closer inspection ; and if she
hasn’t a clean bill of health at the end of
that time she is the nation’s guest until she
has one.
GETTING AS NEAR IT AS HE COULD.
THE FAG : “Oh, I’d go to the war quick
enough, but mother wouldn’t like me
to; and I’ve never disappointed her
since the day I was born."
THE SNAG: “Well, if she was hoping for a
daughter, I’m sure you’ve done your best
to console her."
THE MATRON’S JOY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A curious fortune mine, and long
I’ve hidden deep within my soul
The tragic comedy. In song,
So ludicrous yet full of dole,
It wells now, and it will not stay;
I love the ladies young and gay,
Yet while no maid of dear eighteen
Will turn a fondling smile on me
I’m much besought by dames between,
Say, forty-five and fifty-three.
What strangeness in my being is
To chill the maid, I cannot say ;
What weird and hated feature ’tis
That warms the matron night and day.
I ponder still, and may not know.
A source it is of bitter woe
To seek for youth with eyes of flame,
And never have the luck to see
A soft return but from some dame
Of forty-five or fifty-three.
The widow plump of forty-six,
Or forty-eight, or fifty-two,
For me a nice respect will mix
With tenderness that’s fat and true.
When sweet eighteen without a glance
Runs off to join the heady dance,
I’m cornered in a shelter dim
By diabolic strategy;
Attacking there, with coyness grim,
Is some trim ma’am of fifty-three.
Bucks older far I meet, and they
Still foot it with the flappers. Ah,
I loathe the luck that gives them May,
And leaves to me her fond mamma!
The girl by age beset, we see,
Has pity; none will pity me.
Run as I may, hide in what place
I will, yet with persistence dree
Fate stares me fondly in the face,
And she’s a dame of fifty-three!
VICTORIA.

OLD
Tompsitt, one of the fathers' of pharma-
ceutical chemistry in Melbourne, and partner
in the old Rocke-Tompsitt firm, came to the
end last week. A very reputable citizen was
Tompsitt. When he lost £lOO,OOO in the
Melbourne land-boom it was more than a
loss on paper. But he met the whole lia-
bility without asking for terms. Men as
wealthy as he made much more fuss over
smaller losses. One of his specs, at that
time was the purchase of a city property—
corner of Swanston and A’Beckett streets—
for £27,000 in the fond belief that it would
presently be the centre of an immensely
enlarged Melbourne. After a lapse of 30
years it remains almost as much out of the
world as ever. In his last will the useful
old citizen bequeathed to every employee who
had served the firm for more than five years
an amount equal to two weeks’ salary for
each year of service.
When William F. Abram arrived in Aus-
tralia 33 years ago the bee was an unculti-
vated and mostly unprofitable insect ; but by
systematically importing yellow queens from
Italy and elsewhere Abram improved the
breed and the industry almost beyond recog-
nition. The old enthusiast winged off last
week at Beecroft (N.S.W.), aged 69.
THE OPPORTUNIST.
BESS: “That's Mrs. Grabbit — she's a great
war-worker .”
BOB: “Indeed!”
BESS: “Yes, she's married no less than four
of her daughters to soldiers.”
Concerning an expedition to savage places:
Maoriland’s six editors invited to Europe as the
guests of the British Government are George Fen-
wick, of the Times, Dunedin ; Haeket, Herald, Auck-
land ; Reading, Lyttelton Times, Christchurch;
Charles Earle, Dominion, Wellington; Geddes, Times,
Wellington; and Pirani, Star, Feilding. Fenwick is
the father of the party. If a U-boat ends the expe-
dition he will miss his 72nd birthday. He first went
into the Dunedin office 59 years ago, but was
out of it for a while, after he had finished
his apprenticeship. Pirani is another old hand
Melbourne born. He served his apprenticeship
as a printer on the Herald, Wanganui, in the late
’seventies. For nine years he sat in the House of
Reps, as member for Palmerston North. Earle was
a protegd of Gresley Lukin, and for long' was that
old warrior’s right-hand man on the Post, AVelling-
ton. When the Dominion was launched in 1907 the
young man (lie was 36) was given the chair. Reading
was recently in the sub-editor’s room of the Welling-
ton Times. Haeket, a Scotchman, had his training
in the. Cold Country. Geddes, a bitter enemy of
the Massey Government (but not of the Massev-Ward
fusion), was a few weeks ago called to the Council.
“Yannatherra”: The recent cyclone up
Hull River way robbed us of six-feet-odd of
jfood Australian—Kenny, superintendent of
the Abo. Settlement. He first saw gum-trees
at or near Grafton (N.S.W.) and a knack
of handling the blacks installed him as bud-
gery boss-pfeller at the Hull. On the night
of the zephyr Kenny had a fearsome job to
calm the scared Binghis, and he succeeded
until the homestead began to go. Then
Binghi lit out for the timber as the roof dis-
IN THE BOOM.
THE ARTIST'S FRIEND: “I was- reading an

appeared. Kenny grabbed liis wife and
daughter and made for open country. Trees,
iron-sheets and sundries made the going
exciting. The family sheltered under a
log on the lee side of a hill, and it was there
that a big jagged beani sailed . over and
passed through Kenny’s body. The same
missile killed the daughter. Next day all the
abos. but two answered at roll-cail. The
missing had taken refuge underneath the
house before it collapsed. A wealth of abm
lore went over with the departed super.
The ‘‘Australian Grace Darling,” Mrs.
Eliza Dick, died at her home at Newcastle
last Thursday. She was the widow of Senior-
Sergeant Dick, of the Water Police. Sydney,
and acquired the label in 1863 when she
rescued a man and boy from drowning in
Sydney Harbor. The Water Police Bar-
racks wnre then on Goat Island, and the
Dicks were resident there. W. T. Dick,
M.L.C., is a son.
Luck is against the three Darcy brothers
who are in the cattle business near Hall's
Cr.eek, out on the border of Westralia and
the Territory. A few months ago one of
them was injured by a fall from his horse,
had an operation successfully carried ' out
with a razor under instructions given over
the telegraph wires by Dr. Holland in Perth,
1800 miles way, and died, after all, of fever.
Now a second brother, Tom, has fractured
his thigh, and the same Dr. Holland is giving
hints to a Public Works man who expects
to be up that way shortly.
The oldest ex-Minister now living in N. S.
Wales is Tom Slattery. He held office 33
years ago. But almost every other State can
beat that. In Vic. Alfred Deakin was a
Minister 35 years ago; P. O. Fysh was
Premier of Tasmania 41 years back; J. H.
Symon, who still leads the Bar in S. Aus.,
no matter who is Attorney-General, was
Attorney-General in 1881; and Chief Justice
Griffith was Attorney-General of Queensland
seven years before that.
Though as a matter of principle they will
all be glad to have Australians officering
Australians, many an Anzac will be sorry to
see the last of Brig.-General Noel M. Smyth,
Y.C., the British officer who was in charge of
the First Brigade at Lone Pine and Pozieres.
Quiet, methodical and thorough, he was to
be depended on for delivering the goods, and
his work on Gallipoli won him the C-B. The
Soudan (where he got his V.C.) and S’Africa
were among his earlier campaigns. He was
never a strenuous adyertiser and limelight
man; wherefore Australia heard less about
him than about one or two others who are
to be passed on.
Now on his way to the Front —his first
trip outside his native shire —a young Vic-
torian who until a few months ago had never
heard of the war. Dad, who took in no papers,
worked two remote farms, and the boy’s
first news of battle came from a soldier in
khaki whom he met on a country road. He
thought the man in brown was “a sort of
policeman.” But from him he got the din-
kum oil. conducted a victorious quarrel with
dad, and, after a lot of hanging about, came
to Melbourne and enlisted. To his tent
mates at “Broady” he confided that he was
22, and that Melbourne would make even
dad stare.
Killed in France Lieut. Sam Bankier,
formerly a dentist at Port Macquarie
(N.S.W.). It was Bankier who, as a pri-
vate in the A.M.C., rendered first aid when
General Bridges was mortally wounded.
Major L. E. Beavis, who is listed with the
D.S.O.’s, is the 23-year-old product of Dun-
troon College mentioned in The Bulletin
a while back. Both he and Lieut.-col. G. F.
Murphy, who got a small C.M.G., come from
Bathurst, which has gained as many decora-
tions as any other country town in the Ma
State. Six of its reps, have taken the
D. 5.0., 10 the M.C., five the D.C.M., and
there are a crowd of M.M.’s. Murphy, the
latest in the limelight, gave up tutoring
young Australians to teach the Hun a lesson.
The long-expected knighthood for William
Sowden, of the Register, makes things level
in Adelaide daily-paper offices again. The
late Robert Thomas had one as a proprietor
and business-manager of the Register ; Sow-
den has been editor for 20 years, is one of
the proprietors, and has a host of outside
interests of the unpaid kind. He started
long' ago on the Castlemaine (Vic.) Repre-
sentative, under the brilliant Walstab. but
crossed over into S.A. as a youngster, and
after useful experience at Port Adelaide and
Moonta got into the city office, where he has
been ever since. He is a tremendously hard
worker, writes and talks with equal fluency,
and generally makes a travel-book out of his
rare holidays. Like Bonython, he comes of
a Cornish family.
“Copabella” : They run in all shapes. Our
rabbit-o wears a returned-soldier badge. The
other day while he was removing a bunny’s
overcoat he mentioned casually: “Seems I’m
to have a bit of a decoration!” As I was
interested, he handed over a Defence Depart-
ment envelope. Rabbo proved to be one-
time quartermaster-sergeant of a D.A.0.,
an Anzac and a S’African veteran. His
“bit of a decoration” was the Croix de
Guerre, awarded for putting out a burning
ammunition dump in France in September,
1917, at a time when enemy aircraft was
bombing severely and transport was all
messed up. A British decoration is to
follow. My q.m.s. was a miner at Won-
thaggi before enlisting, but, arriving home
only to bury the wife from whom he had
been parted for three years, he took up
rabbit-hawking to keep his children in town
and have them looked after. Hawking, he
explained, came to his hand first—-that’s why
he did it. And when you come to think of
it, that’s just the very same quality that
makes Billjim the surprising soldier that he
is.
The most picturesque figure in a recent
Tas. municipal conference was old Warden
Dan Burke, who has spent 61 years without
a break on Westbury local-government
bodies, and has been warden for 41 years.
Though now 91 he joined in the debates
vigorously.
A versatile citizen went west when
Colonel Windle Hill St. Hill died at Hobart.
Born in Devonshire, he was on the staff of
General Cameron during the Maori War and
afterwards served in India. He reached
Tasmania in the ’seventies as private sec. to
Governor Weld, and a few years later was
Commandant of the local military forces. In
18S6 he was elected by North Hobart to the
House of Assembly and held the seat till
1893. He will be remembered as the first
man to introduce Eight Hour legislation to
the Speck. For a time he was editor of the
Southern Star, and he was compiler of the
Tasmanian Turf Register. A couple of his
sons are on active service, one being a colonel
in the Northumberland Fusiliers. The other
is in East Africa.
Brig.-General “Pompey” Elliott, who took
the 7th Battalion to Gallipoli, has just added
the C.B. to his D.S.O. This is the sort of
man Pompey is. One lad, who went to the
Front at 18, was given his horse on a weary
march while for 10 miles the 0.C., instead
of leading the column, tramped behind. It
LOW CALLS ON HIS BROTHER-
ARTIST MINNS.
was Pompey, too. who frothed when he
heard of military police bailing up Billjims
on London leave because they had come
straight over from France with the Somme
mud still upon them. Pompey deliberately
muddied himself and then talked to the
brass-hats.
A billet has been found for Harry Jack-
son, who was in the Vaughan Ministry in
S. Aus., and for some years before that was
Speaker. He was thrown out of his Labor
seat for Port Pirie last March, after holding
it for 12 years. Now he goes back to the
town as representative of the Commonwealth
Shipping Board, replacing Capt. Davis, who
took the Aurora to the Antarctic for the
Mawson expedition. Davis returns to active
service.
Ex-constable Cornelius Crowe, who was
convicted of publishing a pamphlet on Mel-
bourne police corruption, which he says he
didn’t publish, is a free man again. He was
in the gaol hospital all the time, and is full
of gratitude to the authorities for the treat-
ment he received.
H. H. Champion, of the Book lover, calcu-
lates that he would have been a General by
this, time had he been able to stick to his
original job of soldiering. Or a corpse ; there
have been heavy casualties in his family—l 4
deaths thusfar, and the others are tramping
steadily between hospital and front-line. One
of his surviving relatives is Field-Marshal
Haig. Considering his physical handicaps
Champion himself manages his bookish
enterprises quite remarkably; and he has
utterly confounded the false prophets who'
years ago would have cut him off in his
prime.
THE TRIUMPH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He drew his war-sword from the wall,
Sloughing its scabbard with a clang,
And in the great assembly hall
His angry voice in thunder rang,
“The world shall- rue my wrath,” said he,
“When thousands in its blasting fall,
And lands shall desolated be!”
The world re-echoed with his tread....
The kind earth slyly hides his dead.
A greater war-lord, Death, goes by,
And scorches life with burning lust;
The gentle songsters trill, and die;
The glad beasts sport, and turn to dust....
Yet are there birds in ev’ry tree,
And sportive field-things leap and fly;
Triumphant life all round I see.
Although a million lives are fled
The kind earth softly hides its dead.
Death at the war-lord, when they meet,
Will grin his ghastly, high disdain ;
“Oh, fool who did my will, how fleet
Pass traces of your anger vain!
For where your hand made waste, the Spring
With joyous wealth has come again,
While you are but a worm-ripe thing.”
And when the words of Death are said,
The earth will hide the outcast dead.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The Bulletin had some Plain English
the other day about superfluous Commis-
sions, based chiefly upon a report issued by
Senator Long, who for some reason or other
had been appointed by W. M. Hughes to
“inquire into the matter of trade between
Australia and Java, Singapore and the East
Indies.” An analysis of the report proves
the Commission to have been worse than
superfluous. _ Not only has Senator Long
shown a certain amount of ingenuity in sup-
plying his report with blazing inaccuracies,
but his conclusions are weird and wonderful.
For instance:—
Our flour alone is high in the public estimation,
a fact that is evidenced by the depreciation in the
export volume per annum from about 26,000 tons to
14,000 tons while the war has been raging.
This probably is the first time on record that
a trade commissioner has taken the falling-
oif of consumption as evidence of public ap-
preciation. But even apart from his figures
the Commissioner is ridiculously inaccurate.
“Our flour alone is high in the public esti-
mation,” he says. If our flour alone is high
in public estimation, why elsewhere does he
say that “our butter stands in high favor in
both of the countries under consideration
[Dutch East Indies and Straits Settlements] ?
The fact, of course, is that frequently the
Commissioner doesn’t mean anything, the re-
port being just a slovenly mass of words.
Elsewhere the ignorance of the report is
almost grotesque. Having mentioned that
these countries show their appreciation of
Australian flour by buying less of it, the im-
ports having declined from 26,000 to 14,000
tons “while the war has been raging,” the
Commissioner proceeds :
The difference in this branch of trade, as expressed
by the figures, was deviated of course to America.
Presuming that this weird remark means that
trade in flour which formerly came to Aus-
tralia has gone to America, what has Senator
Long to say of an official appeal which was
made some time last year to Australia by the
Government of the Straits Settlements, asking
ror regular shipments of Australian flour, as
the U.S.A. had entirely prohibited the export
of foodstuffs? As a matter of fact, the entire
flour supply of the Straits Settlements is
now being provided by Australia.
One might have expected that at least on
the subject of tin and tin-mining this Com-
missioner, coming from a large tin-producing
State, would have avoided the errors over
which one stumbles in the rest of the report.
But Senator Long really excels himself when
he comes to tin
It is a remarkable fact, and one suggestive of the
old proverb of carrying coals to Newcastle, when
one notes that tin was, until recently, exported
from Australia in no inconsiderable quantities to
the Straits Settlements. The reason, of course, is
that some of the largest refineries in the world are
situated there. Tin concentrates amounting to 180
tons were thus exported in 1911; 156 tons were
exported in 1912; and 307 tons in 1913. For the
period 1914-5, however, the total quantity of exports
in tin concentrates amounted to 22 tons; and none
was exported during 1915-6.
Really this is unpardonable. Three minutes
spent with Knibbs would have shown him
that the Australian exports to the Straits
Settlements tin smelters have been as follows:
1911 .. £277,961 1914-5 .. £179,962
1912 .. 387,524 1915-6 .. 239,457
1913 . . 447,875
There is only one thing to be properly done
with this report—to recall and destroy it.
Its facts are not facts and its conclusions
are therefore utterly valueless. Worse, in-
deed, than valueless in many cases: they are
misleading. One of the Commissioner’s
principal recommendations, for instance,
refers to shipping. Now, as to shipping
Senator Long says :
The Royal Packet Co. of Batavia provides ser-
vices to Australia The only other line that;is
trading between Australia and the Dutch East Indies
and the Straits Settlements is that Of Messrs. Burns,
Philp and Co. I understand that yet another line
that used to ply to the Dutch East Indies —the East-
ern and Australian (E. and A.) —has gone out of
commission during the currency of the war.
The West Australian S. N. Co., which has
maintained a regular service between Aus-
tralia, Java and Singapore for over 20
years, is not known to the Commissioner at
all. And as to the E. and A., which “has
gone out of commission during the currency
of the war,” the fact is that it ceased run-
ning to Java and Singapore in 1881. What
sort of conclusions can a Commissioner come
to who knows so little of the facts? And how
dangerous it is to put conclusions so formed
before Parliament and the people for their
guidance!
Trade reports of the right kind are of
infinite value. But to have value they must,
in the first place, be strictly accurate. And
they should be made by a trained investi-
gator. The Australian practice of issuing a
Commission to a politician with no special
aptitude, and calling the result a trade re-
port, ought to be suppressed. Australian
Chambers of Commerce and Manufactures
should see that it is.

When The Bulletin discussed the affairs
of the Colonial Bank three weeks ago and
again urged either amalgamation or an under-
standing amongst banks whereby the number
of branches might be reduced, it was vaguely
understood that a proposal for the union of
the Colonial with the National had for the
time being got into a back-water. Progress
was, however, it seems, still being made;
and the directors are now able to say that
they are unanimously in favor of amalgama-
tion and that a basis is being arranged—a
work which, of course, involves a very great
amount of labor, embracing the valuation of
every security and all 'other assets of each
bank. When the job has been com-
pleted shareholders will be at once told
their fate—whether, for instance, there will
be any writing down of capital, and so on.
Presumably there won’t be any, for the
National’s accounts show net assets rather
over 50 p.c. in excess of capital, while the
Colonial shows over 70 p.c. in excess. Both
have pref. as well as ordinary shares ; and
though that isn’t the ideal constitution for a
bank, it is understood that the basis will be
preserved—probably because the difficulties
in the way of doing anything else seem in-
surmountable. The National has no less than
165 branches and 50 agencies, about half the
total in Victoria; the Colonial has about 70
branches and 30 agencies in Victoria, but
elsewhere none except in Sydney and London.
Apart from the gain in strength by binding
the two together, it should be possible to
make considerable economies, to the advan-
tage alike of customers and shareholders.

The reserves have thus outdistanced the paid
capital of £300,000; and taking that cir-
cumstance into account the directors have
shown a good deal of restraint in keeping
the dividend at the old 8 p.c.—very wise
restraint, in view of the grave uncertainties
of the future. In addressing shareholders
at the half-yearly meeting the chairman said
that “the general business position was favor-
able. Trade was sound and fairly active.”
The Bulletin will be glad if trade proves
to be sound. Its present view, however, is
that the position has in it serious elements
of unsoundness. Prices are high, certainly,
yet people are willing and able to buy freely;
but that is mainly because they are paying
with their own lOU’s. A prosperity based
on an enormous increase of paper money, an
unprecedented expenditure of loan money
and the purchase at abnormal prices of some
of our products is so fictitious that un-
pleasant consequences can hardly be
avoided. There must be readjustments, and
probably violent readjustments; and the
sooner the whole community realises it the
better. No doubt the banks do realise it;
and in that lies one of our best hopes that
we shall get invaluable help through our
difficulties presently.
Going back to the March before the war
started the Royal’s balance-sheet has shown
these changes:—
■ Liabilities.
1914. 1917. 1918.
Notes in circulation.. £1,103 £BBO £872
Bills in circulation, etc. 58,602 250,770 276,756
Deposits at interest . . 1,491,800 1,547,298 1,649,280
Free deposits .. 833,490 1,123,947 1,284,232
Assets.
Liquid assets .. 1,261,233 1,477,911 1,557,931
Advances . . .. 1,590,682 1,963.483 2,189,227
Premises, etc. .. 62,965 83,470 77,700
Total liabilities have thus increased from
£2,384,995 to £3,211,140, or by 35 p.c., while
the holding of liquid assets has increased by
not quite 24 p.c. Advances are 38 p.c.
higher. These figures, as they stand, suggest
that the Royal is making advances pretty
freely, notwithstanding that an unusual pro-
portion of the increased deposits are free—-
probably money awaiting investment. But
this has to be taken into account: for some
reason or other the cash position in 1914
was exceptionally strong, and this justified
the management in financing some of the
new industries which have come into exist-
ence and are making large profits—much
larger profits than they would be entitled to
make if Parliament gave them and their
backers anything like security of tenure. So,
notwithstanding that advances are nearly
£600,000 more, although only £158,000 has
been added to the deposits at interest, the
holding of liquid assets is still equal to over
48 p.c. of all liabilities; and that position,
strong in itself, is further strengthened by
the fact that nearly two-thirds of the liquid
assets are cash, bullion and Commonwealth
Treasury notes. Further, the Royal holds
less than £5 of the public’s money for every
£1 of its own funds; and that and an un-
called capital of £900,000 together make the
position of depositors exceptionally comfort-
able.

For their paper supply Australian news-
papers depended upon Scandinavia, England
and North America; and England got most
of its pulp from Scandinavia, so that, in
practice, Australia depended upon that coun-
try and North America. 1 The English supply
ceased long ago; and to the shipping difficul-
ties in the way of getting Scandinavian sup-
plies has been added the excessive exchange
on remittances to Sweden and Norway, fre-
quently exceeding 40 p.c. Further, though
Scandinavia uses water-power freely, it calls
for large quantities of coal from Britain,
and these have not been available. What
imports there have been have been at abnor-
mal prices; for neither Asquith nor Lloyd
George has been game to seriously tackle
the allied coal and shipping interests, which
are probably the most rapacious in Britain.
American paper-producers made hay while
the sun shone. Latterly, though Wilson’s
cold eye was turned upon them, the increase
of local freights and the demand for ship-
ping for war purposes still made the price to
Australian consumers anything from three
to five times more than it was before the
war.
For some time after the war started Aus-
tralian newspapers were living partly on old
stocks, and war prosperity made it possible
to increase revenue. Twelve months ago the
directors of this co. reported:—
In the case of the Herald increased costs have
been to a great extent counterbalanced up to the
present by very substantial increases in the business
done both in circulation and advertising, with the
result that dividends have been maintained and
reserves strengthened.
There have, however, been further serious in-
creases of costs during the past half-year; and
the co., after paying its 6 p.c. pref. dividend,
has only £2609 net left over, as against
£18,472 in the corresponding half of 1915-6.
Nor is there any prospect of an improvement,
unless it can be made by economies, which
in present circumstances are difficult. The
co. has been fortunate enough to increase its
stocks from £28,517 to £125,978 during the
half-year ; and while it costs money to hold
such large quantities, any additions will
only be got at generally, increased prices—
for some time to come, at any rate. London
Times has trebled its selling price since the
war started; that Australian daily papers
haven’t done something in the same direc-
tion suggests that they either are philan-
thropists or find one or two obstacles in the
path to a common understanding—the same
obstacles, perhaps, that prevented them in
the past co-operating to establish or secure
the output of paper-mills here or elsewhere.
The vicissitudes of the half-year have
altered the look of the balance-sheet figures
a good deal: —

Liquid assets now include nearly £50,000 of
cash, various securities having been realised;
and this and current revenue may soon wipe
out the liabilities, doubtless incurred in con-
nection with shipments of stock. It looks
from this as if all the stock was not in store;
and the best thing shareholders can hope for
at present is -that it gets there.

It has been assumed that income tax for the
past year will call for £5OO ; and that amount
has been deducted from profit accordingly.
The co. has a paid capital now of £12,500 in
25,000 shares paid to 10s. and liable for
another £3 155.: half a crown per share was
transferred from accumulated profits during
the year. The co. operates under a Special
Act which empowers it to do business as
“executor, trustee, attorney, guardian, liqui-
dator, assignee, receiver and committee” ; but
it has a strong and well-entrenched competi-
tor in the. State Office, and its progress isn’t
rapid, seeing that it has been running now
34 years. No doubt it relies mainly upon
the personal connection of the directors and
others interested. That it isn’t losing
ground, however, is shown by the following
comparison of gross earnings:—
1912. 1916. 1917. 1918.
Commissions .. £3730 £4843 £5208 £5608
Interest, etc. .. 1551 1801 1840 2133
Probably in connection with its trustee busi-
ness (though this isn’t specified) it owes
£57,791; and “balances due to the c 0.,” apart
from mortgages, are £45,639. Its other
assets include mortgages, premises and fur-
niture, £15,596; debentures (nature un-
specified), £17,500 ; and cash £7650. A co.
without large expectations; yet on its small
capital capable of showing excellent profits
so long as.it continues to command the con-
fidence of its own little circle.

Ballarat Land Mortgage and Agency
Uo., Ltd.—This co. came into the world 29
years ago. It was a bad time for a finance
co. to be born; but the infant survived and
suffered less than many others that had
much more pretentious cradles. For a good
while past it has had a capital of £20,000 in
20,000 shares of 30s. paid to £l, and it had
reserves of £17,800 after paying the last
half-yearly dividend to March 31. In addi-
tion to its own funds of £37,500 it had at
<^e P. oS its and other liabilities,
an{ * * ts assets were real estate
£97OJ, loans on mortgage and other securi-
mortgage) £58,479, and sundries
£4.L. Since the war started, and especially
ot late, the deposits have been shrinking,
mainly, it is said, because the depositors
wanted the money for War Loans, and the
co, has had to go to the bank; the overdraft
had crept up to £3945 as at March 31.
Now . the directors announce that “the
situation would be best met by calling
up more capital to strengthen the position
of the.co.” Another ss. per share is called
accordingly. The co. faces a position which
a good many others who have lent borrowed
money on mortgage will have to be pre-
pared for. In some centres the position has
been eased by the artificial prosperity which
has made it, as a rule, easy to get in mort-
gages or dispose of foreclosures. Ballarat,
however, isn’t in that position. In the cir-
cumstances the directors seem to have done
the wise thing. It can’t be to the interest
of shareholders to force sales at present.
The next wisest thing is to simultaneously
hang on to whatever money it can get in.
Incidentally if the dividend were reduced a
point or two it would be all the better;
every pound put by now is a good insurance
fund, and if it shouldn’t be needed there is
presumably no dragon on the premises to eat
it. . Last half-year’s profit was £lllO, of
which £9OO was divided. As for depositors
there seems no reason why they should lose
any sleep. The assets are valued at £68,680

The tale of the Broken Hill Prop.:—
The history of the Broken Hill Prop., which is
just undergoing its fourth reorganisation, is one of
the romances of Australian development. Probably,
if it owed its birth to anything more than chance,
it was to Sunny Corner. That moderate little pro-
perty, comparatively handy to the Sydney papers,
made silver talked about; and so Thackaringa and
Purnamoota got attention years after Paddy Green,
the storekeeper at Menindie, had tried to find out
whether the galena which the teamsters used to
bring in from the Barrier was worth anything. That
first little test parcel, by the way, didn’t reach the
smelter: it had an accident en route.
The first Broken Hill syndicate was in 14 shares
held by the manager and employees of Mount Gipps
station. The storekeeper sold his two for £25.
The prospectus of the first co. was issued on June
29, 1885. Each share in the syndicate carried 1000
shares in the co., less a few they gave away, and
the public was asked to pay £9 each for 2000.
The 16,000 were then to be issued as paid to £l9.
The float was viewed coldly, although even then a
lode 21ft. “thick” was showing at 150 ft.—in a shaft
partly sunk, by the way, under the supervision of
David James, who won a Melbourne Cup later. He
was doing a contracting job at Nine Mile in ’B4.
But though five bags from a crosscut at 100 ft. had
assayed 118 oz., and for 7ft. wide at 150 ft. the lode
carried chlorides freely, all the prospectus ventured
was that “the whole width is believed to be highly
payable.” Three of the provisional directors are
. directors still- —Bowes Kelly, Harvey Patterson and
William Jamieson. They would put it differently if
they had to do it again.
The first split occurred in Feb., 1889, when the
16,000 shares were cut into 160,000, of £2, paid to
38s. Then London and Glasgow began to take notice,
Dick, of Belata belting, being one of the first to
smell it out. But London didn’t like a liability on
the shares, so the 2s. was called up. The co. had
pulled through without calls thus far. It was early
in 1890 that London was obliged: the shares were
cut into fives on the “colonial” register with an
extra One for the London register, making in all
960,000 shares fully paid to Bs. It lasted like
that for over 21 years. At first the furnaces were
on the mine; but in John Howell’s day a start was
made to smelt at the seaboard. The British, a pup
co., was the first to put up furnaces at Port Piri'e.
For these works it was necessary to get iron flux in
the neighborhood; and the Iron Knob, across the
Gulf, was taken up. v
The story of the first attempt at making
pig iron out of this flux has yet to be told. As a
matter of fact, there was a bit of a row about it.
A furnace was lying idle, and some enterprising
metallurgist wondered whether he could make pigs
with it. He succeeded —but didn’t improve the furnace.
Probably, however, general-manager Delprat kept the
incident at the back of his head ; and in 1912, after
elaborate inquiries, the scheme for making a modest
start on steel works at Newcastle was launched.
This meant another reorganisation: the authorised
capital was increased by 540,000 shares, of which
221,006 were issued at a net premium of £353,610.
Then came the war; and, the operations having been
technically successful, the directors seized the oppor-
tunity to pass on the lead smelters and silver refin-
ery, etc., at Port Pirie to the Associated Smelters,
putting the proceeds, as well as £1,000,000 of
debentures, into the new undertaking, on which up
to the present time upwards of £2,750,000 has
been spent.
Incidentally £10,250,000 has been paid in divi-
dends by the Broken Hill Prop. ; and, besides, the
old co. floated off Block 14, the British and Block
10, which have all been big dividend-payers, and
have in their turn promoted other cos., notably the
Misima and the King Island Scheelite. Indirectly,
and apart from what the iron and steel industry has
done already, the benefits the country has derived are
enormous. For one thing the co. developed the coke
industry, which until then had scarcely been born;
for another it trained an army of engineers and
especially chemists who, besides developing the zinc
industry (to the greater benefit perhaps of Germany
than Australia —but that was our own fault), have
enormously influenced the metallurgical practice of
the lialgoorlie and other fields.

Mammoth Molybdenite (N.S.W.), after
having a rough time on the Sydney market,
had its boom last week; somebody had got
early information that the Broken Hill Prop,
was after an option over approximately a
third of the property. Nothing may come
of it, of course; but at any rate the show —
or part of it—will be thoroughly sampled for
the first time. The Molybdenite directors
don’t announce the terms; they merely say
they consider them favorable.
The Mammoth has so far been working
two shifts, but is now getting labor for a
third. Meantime two new 100 ft. tunnels are
being driven; one is already in 56ft. and
showing “fairly decent’’ ore. The directors
have also decided to double the 10-head bat-
tery at a cost of about £4OOO, and the
enlarged plant should be at work within
four months. Running two shifts, the pre-
sent plant can put through 126 tons ore a
week at a cost of just under 245., exclusive
of development charges and royalty. With a
75 p.c. recovery profits work out this way:
.33 p.c. ore, £4 175.; .50 p.c., £B5 45.; .75 p.c.
£203 65.; 1 p.c., £321 9s. Working three
shifts costs will be reduced to 20s. per ton,
handling 190 tons a week; and when the 20
stamps are at work, it is reckoned that costs
can be cut to 14s. 3d. per ton, handling 380
tons. Figures for the latest run have not
been made available, but this paper believes
the grade has been averaging somewhere
about .7 p.c. If that is so, the question is
whether the average can be maintained ; and
that is a story the battery is left to tell.
Slee, the Broken Hill Prop.’s underground
man, lias been watching operations for
several weeks past; and it was on his report
that the directors asked for a working option.
* * * *
Vegetable Creek, Emmaville (N.S.W.),is
practically on the last lap : shareholders were
told the other day that the end might come
after another year’s work, and that the cur-
tain would certainly be drawn within two
years. The directors are at present looking
round for a new property. Ore reserves at the
end of April were estimated at 270 tons.
Twelve months previously they stood at 245
tons, and 204 tons were got out during the
year. Boring has produced nothing but disap-
pointments, and though the wash in the recent
developments in the Gordon shaft is of
good quality it apparently has little body.
The year’s output of 204 tons realised
£37,227, or an average of over £lB2 per ton.
Taxes absorbed £3956, and after paying exes,
and allowing £626 for depreciation, there was
a net profit of £9061. Three sixpennies, ab-
sorbing £10,125, have been distributed. There
are 135,000 shares paid to 16s. 3d.; and there
is £6003 in War Loan and fixed deposits, a
bank balance of £862, unsold ore worth
£3742, and plant and stores of a book
value of £6452. The Board has been
reduced to three by the dropping of the two
Adelaide directors, originally appointed to
represent 64,000 shares, but now dwindled
to a third of that holding.
* * # *
From Westonia.: —
From now on Edna May Deeps will be able to extract
very little high-grade ore from the rich stope above
the 566 ft. level. The stope has already been taken
up so high in the rich ore that the block remaining
must be left standing solid to ensure safety. This
level, therefore, may be regarded as practically
exhausted so far as high-grade material is concerned.
The 666 ft. level has opened up much as expected,
for development has proved that the Edna May reef
has been gradually losing its width and gold content
from the 300 ft. level. The falling-off in this respect
from the 566 ft. to 666 ft. is most marked. The winze
connecting these two levels, partially through the
rich ore, has already seriously depleted the rich
stope above the 666 ft. level. However, there is still
a quantity of high-grade ore available above this
point, which may enable the co. to show decent
yields for a few months. The 666 ft. level has been
extended a distance of 108 ft. and, provided the reef
turns suddenly to the north, the level may be
extended for a further 70ft. or so. At the same
time, it should be remembered that length does
not necessarily count for much, as the further north
you go the less the gold content. And, as the reef
is already very close to the Central boundary, the
latter will probably receive what is left after sink-
ing another level or two. Meanwhile, driving is
held-up, all hands being urgently required for stoping
in the 666 ft. level. As to the future, it does not
seem likely that the mine can be worked at a profit
except by winzing or underhand stoping on what
remains of the rich shoot below 666 ft. The value
therefore of the concern seems to be contained in
ore reserves between 566 ft. and 666 ft. levels, and these
do not exceed 15,000 tons. As the co., with the
aid of £13,000 from reserve shares, paid only
2s. 6d. in dividends from the 566 ft. level, share-
holders can estimate for themselves what amount
might reasonably be expected in dividends from the
666 ft. level. Certainly, the co. may locate a new
payable ore body; but as regards ore in sight and
ore which may be reasonably said to be in prospect,
anyone who looks for more than ss. per share in
dividends is an outsize in optimists.
The water difficulty at Westonia continues very
serious, and it seems likely that when the 25,000
tons or so of ore remaining at the 385 ft. and 480 ft.
Edna May levels have been treated the end of
Westonia will be at hand. Of course there is a
considerable area of likely country still unprospected
bQth inside and out of the areas held by the cos.,
and it is probable that prospecting will disclose
something worth while. But there is no time to
waste. If efforts are not pursued in this direction,
or if they prove unsuccessful, the Edna May pumps
will most* likely cease operating in about 18 months.
The curtain may then be rung down on Westonia.
Recently a meeting of shareholders of the
New Queen Cross, Charters Towers (Q.),
was called to discuss winding-up, but before
the meeting the manager discovered a new
make of stone in one of the bottom levels.
So now the question of winding-up has been
postponed in the hope that the new make
may prove to be a cross reef, for it isn’t for-
gotten that the Papuan next door discovered
a rich cross reef —now worked out —in ex-
ploring the workings of the Moonstone. The
Moonstone reef extends into the new Queen
Cross; but the Cross has only been able to
pay one dividend on 200,000 shares. The
latest crushing was 21 tons for an average of
£6 11s. 3d. per ton.
* * *
“Old Hand”: It’s up to Dalmayne (Tas.)
y°“ ie }'y directors to keep a sharp eye on the
trafficking in the co.’s scrip. Shares are
being picked up quietly in Melbourne at ss.
and ladled out again at 20s. This is very
nice for the chap who collars the 155., but it
is bad biz for the holder who is caught on the
hop. If the scrip was listed this couldn’t hap-
pen. Though the world isn’t told the fact, the
mine has fully 30 working faces ready, and
a ropeway capable of carrying 150,000 tons
annually. There’s a big hopper on the jetty
end full of coal. But it might have stuck
there if the jetty hadn’t been lengthened
150 ft. to give a depth of 26ft. for decent-
sized craft. Moorings are being got ready, so
that things will hum directly the co. can get
a steamer or two into the trade. Dalmayne
is only 270 miles from Melbourne, and the
Board offers the Lawson Government
200.000 tons at 11s. 2d. f.o.b. That means
cheap fuel in winter-time if the ships can be
got. It also explains why the knowing ones
have been hunting after cheap shares.
Cyclones, a strike by little brown brother
for white man’s pay, and poorer ground
clipped profits for John McWhae’s Philip-
pine Co.’s dredges last year:—

Though the wash worked by No. 2 was lower
grade, still for nearly half the year the
dredge was nosing into ground worth Is. 2d.
per cub. yard. Now the warning is given
by manager Telford that a big lump has been
sliced out of the rich Cocoanut lease. The
verdict in respect to No. 1 plant is that it.
will finish up the ground suitable to its capa-
city this year. Ahead of No. 3 is a deep-
dredging campaign, but it still has a fair
area of the ninepenny ground to operate on.
No. 4 is due for better things, as it is work-
ing into the best section of the Casalogan
lease. All in all, the past year’s work was
disappointing, and except for the first Is. div.
all the co. did was to wipe off a tenth of its
debenture debt of £46,000. Since the books
were closed, however,. results have looked up,
and another shilling for shareholders is fore-
casted. But the heavy capitalisation of this
Filipino show is a handicap, profits having
to be spread over 174,600 shares; and if it
weren’t for the richness of the areas worked
by No. 2 and No. 3 dredges, divs. would be
either very small very infrequent. The
Philippine Co. owns 97,075 shares in the
Paracale Co., for which it runs No. 1 and
No. 3 plants. Its div. from the Paracale
was £7281. It had a working profit of
£20,975 from its own two dredges, and a
total net profit for the year of £24,339.
W. A. Freeman’s Austral Bolivia, Ltd., re-
gistered in January, 1916, has just issued its
first report. But a whole lot of things have
been done meanwhile. The co. was an off-
shoot of Austral Malay, Ltd. —floated
off because some shareholders in the
parent had an idea that this was a
wild-goose chase. Gore Adams, a M.L.
engineer, told The Bulletin remark-
able stories of tin-dredging possibilities in
far-away. Bolivia, and was passed on to
Freeman, among others, to discuss whether
Australia couldn’t make something out of
that region as it had out of Malaya. Free-
man interested first his Austral Malay Co.;
and then Austral Bolivia, Ltd., was formed
to investigate an option in which Adams
was interested. The preliminary reports
were highly satisfactory; but the Govern-
ment intimated that no money must go out
of Australia to develop a foreign property.
So Freeman went to Uncle Sam at Boston :
After considerable negotiation terms were agreed
upon and on February 27, 1917, a co. called Bolivia
Tin Corporation was incorporated in the State of
Maine, U.S.A., in 240,000 shares of $5 each to take
over not only the mine, but also the Undertaking
generally of this co. The contract provided that
this co. should receive 20,000 shares plus a return
of its expenditure.
R. P. Lawrence, who had made some of the
preliminary inquiries on behalf of the Syd-
ney co., was appointed managing director.
The American co. got to work promptly, and
made contracts for two big bucket dredges
and a concentrating mill. Last December
the mill began work on some dumps of
residues, and the first dredge went into com-
mission on April 28. For April “the produc-
tion from Indian labor and from the dumps
of residues was 140 tons assaying 53 p.c. tin
oxide.” The balance-sheet shows that the
paid capital is £13,600. The promoters who
had the Mendieta options get £4000; and,
after allowing for interest earnings on one
side and exes, on the other, the Sydney co.
will have 20,000 shares and about £12,000
to distribute. Austral Bolivia will then be
liquidated subject to consent under the
War Precautions Regulations.
The wonderful old Tasmania mine,
Beaconsfield (Tas.), is nearing the end of
the supply of concentrates from which it
has been squeezing two or three thousand
pounds a month since work stopped under-
ground. The last clean-up of seven weeks’ work
Produced only 7770 z. gold, worth £3295, from
1848 tons treated. The roasting and grind-
ing plant has been closed down for altera-
tions, which are expected to take three
months. The winding up of the co. has so
far produced one Is. dividend. It is a slow
business. Meantime, the township of
Beaconsfield, which depended on this mine,
is gradually pulling itself up by the roots.
* * * *
The little Bobbin Billie, near Oberon
(N.S.W.), is engaging some local attention.
A first small consignment to Cockle Creek
has returned just over an ounce to the ton,
which leaves a margin over exes. The reef
is about 2ft. wide, and has been developed a
distance of 150 ft.

WHAT DOCTORS PRESCRIBE FOR
INDIGESTION.
Physicians who have specialised in the
treatment of stomach troubles are naturally
in a position to judge intelligently as to the
best thing to use. It is therefore a matter
of interest to those who suffer from indiges-
tion, gastritis, dyspepsia, pain after eating,
heartburn, etc., to learn that physicians who
have devoted their lives to the alleviation of
human suffering are more and more instruct-
ing these sufferers to get a package of
Bisurated Magnesia from the chemist and
take a half-teaspoonful in a little hot water
immediately after eating or whenever pain
is felt. Doctors who prescribe Bisurated
Magnesia do so because they know it gives
quick relief in nearly every instance —because
it. is not a secret remedy, and because no ill-
effect follows its use. For these reasons suf-
ferers from dyspepsia, indigestion and
stomach troubles generally are strongly ad-
vised to get a package of Bisurated Magnesia
from their nearest chemist and begin its use
without delay.— Advt.

Sydney, June 10, 1918.
My Deab Arini, —
A Duntroon collegian, writing to his home
tolk, states that some of our friends the
enemy are most comfortably housed in his
vicinity, with a portion of our army told off
to chop his firewood. Do they do things that
way in the Fatherland?
An Australian girl in London writes that
Genevieve Ward spent her 81st birthday at
an At Home to Australian officers given by the
Hon. Mrs. Edwards, who makes it a weekly
festival. Genevieve delighted the Aussies
with sprightly recitations and the poise of a
schoolgirl. She says it’s a confirmed habit of v
sipping milk that does it. In the company
was that famous Harriet Phipps who has
also a wonderful grip on this planet. Lady-
in-waiting . and for 40 years private sec. to
Queen Victoria—yes, Harriet must have
started with an iron frame. The old lady
lives at Kensington Palace, and encourages
Australians to look her up.
The best Anglicans are in mourning for
Mrs. Clarissa Docker—wife of the Judge—
who died last week. The church and the
rectory had never been far from her. Dr.
Tucker, her father, was an archdeacon at
Wangaratta (Vic.) in the long ago. Her
brother, Horace Tucker, was the big, bearded,
likeable parson who shepherded Christ
Church, South Yarra, and started the Cab-
bage Garden’s earliest village settlement.
Her sister married Dr. Green, who bished
at Armidale and later at Ballarat. There
are two more mitres in the family. Mrs.
Docker’s second daughter, Mildred, married
Maynard Pain, a medical missionary, son
of that Dr. Pain who till recently wore
gaiters in Gippsland ; and her niece is the
wife of Dr. Stephen, the brainy Victorian
who bishes in Hobart.
When the widower Dr. Saumarez Smith
was Primate in Sydney, Mrs. Docker, as
principal lay-woman, was president of the
Anglican Girls’ Friendly Society for many
years, stepping down to the vice-chair nine
years ago when the new Archgaiters brought
a wife with him. Half a dozen other church
funds and charities kept her busy, but she
found time ,to manage a household of
seven daughters and two sons. Three
daughters are married, but two —Mrs. Pain
and Mrs. Piddington—were widowed in
their mother’s lifetime. The third is the
wife of Frederick Campbell, who lectures at
Melbourne Uni. Of the four unmarried
daughters the eldest is secretary of the
Gii'ls’ Friendly Society; another 1 , with a
B.A. degree, is on the staff of the Public
Library. Of tw'o sons the elder grows wool
in Central Queensland ; the younger is a
doctor with the A.I.F. in France.
The late Mrs. Docker was a cousin of
General Finn. The gentle lady came from
the North of England as a youngster. Her
mother - , Mrs. Tucker, however, hailed from
Kent, where the Finn family had grown Rom-
ney sheep for generations. When financial
disaster crowded round the old Finn home,
son Harry determined to be a soldier. There
was no money to buy a commission. So he
enlisted —a social crime at which Aunt
Tucker could only look askance. But the
long claw of coincidence brought the cousins
to Sydney. The then Colonel Finn, with
much distinguished service behind him, was
State Commandant, while Mrs. Ernest w y as
the wife of a District Court Judge.
Sister A. M. James came back home —she
is a Westralian girl—by a trooper which left
England on April 7 and arrived at Fremantle
on May 22. But, having met Lieut. W. J.
Whettam, M.C., on the wild, wet sea, she
was persuaded to come on to Sydney, which
was reached on June 1. Five days later they
were married at St. Andrew’s. The bride
had done her bit, anyhow; she had given 3J
years to woi’k in Egypt and on troopships.
The ’groom was with the Tunnellers, and
had two years’ service.
The King Salters engineered a dance at
Cockatoo in a big room usually given over
to service goods. It happens to possess a
good floor, so the present-time dancing-shoe—a
thing with a delicate sole at best—didn’t come
to pieces. The mundane object of the party was
to raise £5O for soldiers’ huts at the Front.
The Salter purse paid for the supper, so
there are practically no exes. Boats swished
through the rainy night to pick up nice girls
at adjacent waterside villages; and sailors
helped to twirl them through the pleasant
evening.
Field-Artillery dames put their bonnets
together to secure Lady Davidson for a gift
afternoon in St. James’s Hall last week.
Brown-paper parcels advanced in heavy
battalions, and scarlet poinsettias nodded on
the table in front of the armchair. But
the Government House lady did not come —
Someone had forgotten to pass on the
request. Mrs. Davenport, entirely sur-
rounded by white furs, watched the front
door, and assistant artillery-women anxiously
scanned the horizon. In vain! Dorrie
Ward sang to a full house, and a male voice
entreated his fellows to “Take a Pair of
Sparkling Eyes.” Mrs. Agnes King, Mrs.
Arthur Tower, and some of our Best Hats
assisted.
In spite of precautions to keep the knot-
tying a quiet family affair, numbers of
friends, countrywomen and sightseers clus-
tered round the slim young bride as she left
bleak All Saints' Church on the arm of her
just-wed husband Ken Austin. Joyce Allen’s
froeking was of that “simple” sort quite
impossible to the merely poor—georgette fine
as the silky Indian muslin of long ago, with
a glimmer of pearls and a foam of white
tulle for a veil. She’s a daughter of Arthur
Allen of the legal firm. Two younger sisters,
Margaret and Marcia, with cousin Barbara,
rustled along in faintly-tinted tucked gar-
ments, while a herd of motors snorted in the
street. The ’groom is a son of Henry Austin,
the wonderfully-preserved veteran who walks
into town from Boslyn Gardens.
A returned Aussie who wears the M.C. —
Major Kirkwood —led a Wollstonecraft girl
down St. James’s aisle the other day. The
bride, Kathleen Wynter, is a forceful young
person, well known in knitting strongholds.
He has had five brothers at the Front, and
she has three.
Dr. Baret, resident junior at the Water-
fall Sanatorium, is getting into khaki, and
the ’torium folks have handed him a set of
military brushes, pocket wallet and ’baccy
pouch, with their good wishes engraved on
each article.
A matinee in the Palace Theatre on June
20 will be another rib in the body of Italy’s
Day. Mostly tableaux. The Sydney girl
is going to look as like a 16th-century damsel
as her sun-kissed face permits.
Escorted by a couple of dozen of his
friends, Jack Garry, of Garryowen, Bina-
long, one time inter-State footballer of some
note, marched through town with reinforce-
ments for the Other Side. He leaves a wife
and two kiddies to await his return, and
four brothers to keep watch over his inter-
ests bn the land.
Artist Eliott
Gruner (father was
a Norwegian) cheer-
ily writes that he
“w r ent into camp on
J u n e 3—King’s
Birthday for luck!”
For months he has
been living in the
open, painting here
and there, but chiefly
bracing up a not-
over-robust frame for
the soldier’s job. His
heart was set on
going to the Front
with the A.M.C.,
which faces the
enemy with a ban-
dage and a roll of
sticking-plaster. But
the new “general service or nothing” order is
iron—and into the general melting-pot go
the artist’s delicate fingers with the horny
hands of others. The artist is one to whom
Australia will say “So-long!” with regret.
As a landscape-painter Gruner puts a touch
of Aready into a cultivation paddock and the
glamor of Australian sunshine into a paling
fence.
Gruner started as a small boy—so small
that some friendly hand probably lifted him
on to his high chair —in Julian Ashton’s
studio. An elder brother had determined
that the youngster should be a musician, and
an Irish mother saw no just impediment.
But the art instinct was stronger than
either. A compromise w r as made. The
youthful Eliott churned out so many five-
finger and other exercises each day on the
piano, and in his off-time was allowed a
brush. Then the elder brother died, and
Eliott had the good son’s privilege of looking
after his mother. He kept the family pot
boiling in uncongenial wa-ys with his paint-
ing as a small side-line. Seven years ago,
after many struggles, he joined the Society
of Artists as Ashton’s assistant-teacher.
Then the sun began to shine. When general-
manager Russell French was to get a jubilee
present from the officers of the Bank of N. S.
Wales, an oil-painting by Griiner was chosen
and a hundred guineas paid for it. From
that day the artist’s luck has never changed;
and to-day he hasn’t a yard of canvas left.
All his pictures are sold at prices that would
have astonished the Australian artist of 25
years ago. On this financial success has fol-
lowed his long-deferred desire —to get into
khaki. A legion of friends —4or Gruner is
one of the best-liked men in his profession —
wish him the best of luck and a safe home-
coming. May Moore in a life-like photo
of the artist emphasises that mixture of
gentleness and tenacity which is characteris-
tic of the subject. Note the almost sculp-
tural firmness of the brow.
Here is Lieut. P.
V. Stor k e y, our
very newest V.C.
The cold official
statement is:—
He commanded an
attacking platoon which,
emerging from a wood,
observed eighty or a hun-
dred of the enemy with
several machine - guns
holding up the advance
of troops on his right.
...Storkey had only six
men.... Lietit. Lipscomb
and four others joined
him, and he decided to
attack. Storkey led his
men, expelled the foe,
killed and wounded 30,
and captured three offi-
cers and 50 men with
some machine-guns.
Though the gallant youngster’s people live at
Napier, M.L., he enlisted in N. S. Wales, on
December, 1915. He left with reinforcements
of the 19th Battalion. Since then he has been
twice wounded —but evidently very effectively
mended. The hero’s laughing face was
snapped by Judith Fletcher just before he
left Svdney. The 19th Comforters, by the
way, have their half-yearly meeting at 11
Bent-street this mid-week.
Also in Artillery trappings is Frank
Hughes, last of the eligible sons of the late
John, M.L.C., to go forth to battle. Two
brothers, Bryan and Gilbert, have done
things with the British, but Frank, good
Australian, clings to the A.I.F.
From one of ours in France :
Met yesterday that good Australian, Sergeant Flora
Sandes, on her way back to Servia, after a spell in
England. She went out there first as a V.A.D.
nurse, and ultimately joined the combatant ranks
on their hospital being scuppered during the retreat.
She has been wounded several times and sports a
row of decorations. And she’s not of the masculine
type—quite the reverse; has a quiet voice and soft
biown eyes. What we want to know is whether you
could get one of our dear lads in Australia to volun-
teer to take her place in the home while she’s away.
On June 14 comes Violet Day, when the
desperate citizen can escape by the purchase
of a few of the scented blossoms. There
will be other temptations, of course. Com-
forts funds dames are stocking their stalls
with sweets and cakes, and (hush!) I think
the raffler may get the usual thrill of pass-
ing on a boudoir cap to a confirmed bachelor.
Grace Burrows is organising this effort to
re-stock the Soldiers’ Club.
A bride of this week, Mavis Thompson, of
Queensland, is to wear all the finery that one
girl can reasonably be expected to carry to
the altar. Ivory charmeuse embroidered in
silver, with floating tulle drapery; train, a
vision lined with shell-pink georgette, and
silver roses a-shimmer at the waist. (The
architect of this morning glory was Mrs.
Elsie Page, by the way.) Bridesmaidens
Thompson and Hordern will float behind the
heroine in St. Mark’s ; they will be in blush
pink and charmeuse with billows of georgette
and silver lace to hold the drapery. The
young man, if thafs worth mentioning, is
Lieut. See.
Charming Emelie Polini as the freak-
brained De Luxe Annie is still drawing big
houses at the Palace. On Saturday night, in
spite of muddied streets and sleety rain, or
perhaps because of these things, local society
rolled up furred to the ears. One of the best
pelts of the evening was thrown round the
graceful shoulders of young Mrs. Leslie Wal-
ford, the Dora Alexander of so many amateur
shows.
The words of Delany’s cantata “Captain
Cook” were written in 1888 by ex-M.L.A.
Pat Quinn. Pat put his muse into cold stor-
age for many years, and wrote nothing while
he was away in the U'.S.A. But the breezes
of Australia have fanned the old embers, and
once more gentle Roderic isn’t the only poet
in the family.
Letters come this way in strange hand-
writing from L. W. Robinson, a Sydney
solicitor and a former mayor of Woollahra.
Shortly after the death of his wife Robinson
’listed and managed to lose his right hand in
France. But he got to work promptly and
learned to write with his left, and manages
quite well. He is on a Home Service job in
England now.
The Russell Richardsons’ soldier-son—the
major who got a Military Cross for his
bravery at the Landing and afterwards —put
the usual circlet on the finger of Mollie
Snape, an Armidale girl, a week or two ago.
The Richardsons are old residents of the
same hamlet.
Poor Derek Hudson, one of the few
musicianly singers whom we have had lately
in modern very light-opera, is now T officially
reported dead of wounds in Finance. For
weeks his wife, in one of the J.C.W. com-
panies, has been clinging to that frail straw
—“Reported missing.”
Still another amateur lot, “The Gipsy
Singing Girls,” threaten to have the last shil-
ling the Northern Suburbs are trying to hide.
The Gips, trained by Rita Lancaster, invade
the city on Saturday, June 15. They’ll pack
their kit in Hornsby and lift up their voices
in the King’s Hall at eight. Proceeds go to
the Waitara branch of the War Chest and the
Hornsby Red Cross.
The fatted cream-puff was killed for Peter
Dawson and Mrs. Annette Peter the other
afternoon. Oswmld Anderson, who is manag-
ing Private Dawson’s farewell concerts in the
Town Hall, was in charge. The baritone
wall appropriately sing “I’m a Roamer” —
he’s on final leave.
General Botha’s son, Captain Louis Botha,
is engaged to Agnes Macdonald, of Spley
Manor, N.B. I suspect the lass not to be
of pure Dutch descent.
The Horty ladies are doing well with their
tea-and-bun shop in the city. It may grow
into a concern with a King-street restaurant
in the future. But life is not all buttered
scones. They slipped off their overalls the
other day, put on their winter coats and
listened while Government poultry-expert
J. Hadlington told the life-story of a
chicken. I don’t know whether it was a
parable or not.
Mrs. Trefle is pushing a Good Shepherd
Home party at the Carlton on June 18. The
company will hold its breath while a gos-
samer-trousseau raffle is drawn.
The patriotic citizen who is following the
new gospel of more publicity, band music
and banners for our returning soldier boys,
seems to have forgotten the nurses who come
back with the transports. After years of
work in Allied hospitals, running, among
other risks, gas and bombing by Hun ’planes,
and working among sick and wounded on
home-coming transports, nurses are allowed
to lapd behind the camouflage of public indif-
ference. There is no provision of motor-
cars for them. If there is a spare seat in
a Red Cross car and a nurse encumbered with
a suitcase chances along looking with large,
hungry eyes for a brief taste of limousine
life, she might be invited to fill the vacuum.
But otherwise she may struggle along as best
she can, with no inclusion in the welcome of
netrol, cheers and tea. Suppose the women
who haven’t done a blessed thing in the way
of war-work take this little matter up and
help save their faces—if not their souls ?
Yours affectionately,
VANDOBIAN.

Melbourne, June 10, 1918.
My Dear Yarrie,—
The Bing Boys’ Ball, advertised for 8.30
on Thursday night, really got going about
midnight. The sets were scheduled for 11.30.
There weren’t many of them. A big chiffon
store had one; its njannequins stepped out
of a huge bandbox lined with quilted rose
silk and got ready for the lancers. Another
rag shop had a burlesque set of boys dressed
as girls. Then the Bing Boys’ stars formed
a set and joined in a procession. Captain
Conant tried to form a set of his picture-
stars, but it fell through, as his crack per-
formers had been grabbed by Mrs. Leslie
Stuart for her Kiss Trot set—the historical
matinee Kiss Trotters who dress in black
net and green sashes. But in some cases
a prudent mother had added a piece to the
filmy underskirt. Others with more amen-
able mammas came in the net-filmed hlack-
silk tights of the momentous stage appear-
ance, arid were mildly sensational in the
strenuous twostep. Archie Whyte and
Westmaeott, of the J.C.W. army, acted as
M.’sC. for the spectacular sets. They fin-
ished their job mopping their brows.
The patriotic committee sat on the plat-
form like waxworks figures. They were
well protected by pot plants and each had
paid a guinea. There was a fine exhibit of
mayors. Roma 1 Clarke was in the waxworks
along with dad ; so was Gordon Knox. The
younger fry descended occasionally for a
whirl when the music got too tempting.
Char. Crespin arrived in civvies. There is
a murmur of his brother’s aspirations to
the mayoral chair next year.
With exceptions the ball was shockingly
dressed. Mrs. Archie Whyte wore black
tulle and the favorite green scarf of the
moment. Mrs. Geoff Syme was occupied
with committee work. The ball was arranged
so breathlessly as to leave the actively-
interested women no time for relaxation.
Mrs. Barry Thompson spent much of the
evening soothing Mrs. Fred Pett while the
doctor mended a broken limb. Marie Tem-
pest arrived late in a mask with a lace-fringe
and a gorgeous brocade gown. The Bates
Post pair came on after their show. Maie
Baird led the procession in her best red-silk
tights. Mrs. Jack Dunlop wore a low black
gown with dangerously-filmy shoulder-straps.
The Thiels brought the decorative Mavis
and took her home before midnight. Betty
O’Hara usurped Mavis’s place as receiver of
congratulations. Beryl Fitz just yearned to
show her engagement ring. Bayley Jones
Was in brave naval uniform, and there
were other touches of black cloth and gold
lace among the khaki uniforms. Mrs. Nor-
man Brookes wore pastel chiffons and a
worried look. She and Mrs. Thompson were
running the show. The gate-money goes to
the Mayoress’s Fund and the Patriotic
League. Lady Stanley sent her “patronage”
and some guineas, but did not attend.
Mrs. Fred Pett, a dainty little woman
about five-feet-nothing, caused a sensation
on Thursday night at the Bing Boys Ball by
breaking her leg five minutes after she started
dancing. There were half a dozen doctors
frivolling, but Barry Thompson reached the
job first, and had to be operated on himself
later because of a splinter he ran into his
hand while preparing a makeshift spliat.
“Katinka” opened on Saturday night to
a packed house. Marie Tempest was in a
box with Captain Conant and Grace Palotta.
“Mary” (as she calls herself) was in a
dusky blue gown with a pink vanity-bag on
the ledge Of the box. Grace got a “hand”
from the gallery and gave an embarrassed
bow when the gallery yelled “Miss Palotta!”
Star Marie took her welcome with a smile.
Grace Palotta wore very transparent
black lace over flesh-pink ribands. Pearce,
Minister for Expense, was boxed opposite
with his little wife in black and two large
flump daughters in full opera undress. A
odyguard of khaki lurked in the gloom.
Lawyer Whiting’s shirt-front took up so
much room in the front of his pen that son
Harry—a just-returned invalided warrior—
had to sit in the stalls with a remarkably
pretty girl in pink. Stella Nathan occupied
an orchestra stall with a pale green tulle
neck ruffle to keep off pneumonia. Mrs.
Norman Brookes brought along a dinner
party to the stalls. Mrs. Leslie Stuart had
entertained her 20 girl Kiss Trotters at
dinner with 20 carefully-selected men part-
uers, and they were all at the show. Mrs.
Fleming (N.S.W.) had a party of girls in a
south box; one wore a glowing scarlet cloak.
Mrs. Kerr had her daughter with her in the
circle —a pale, pink-frocked youngster.
Charlie Tait sat in centre circle, and his
lady was a bunch of vieux-rose velvet.
One of the swankiest parties of the season
will happen on July 10. The committee-
women can all boast soldier-men at the war
from the early days. There is Mrs. H. A.
Dodd, whose son has the M.C., and has been
in the Second Field Artillery since the
horses were first harnessed; Mrs. Hal Reg-
gall, whose colonel-husband is a D.S.O. in
the same division ; Mrs. Reggie Clarke and
Mrs. Haydn Starke; Miss Madge Back,
whose fianc6, Captain Charles Duffy, is in
France; and Betty O’Hara, because her
young man (Mr. Stodart) has been away
since 1914: and Margot McKinnon, whose
cousin lately gave his life in the Division.
Tettie Appleton (daughter of the Colonel)
and Geoffrey Strachan are joint secs, and
brigadiers of the show. Geoffrey is an in-
valided soldier from the Second. Mrs. Leslie
Stuart is giving her house and standing all
the expense of the party. The revel is to
happen on Wednesday night, July 10, and
everybody knows that the Stuarts’ ballroom
is a dream. There is such a rush that the
tickets may have to be auctioned. Cards
and billiards for non-dancers. The funds
are to provide the Second with a regal
Christmas dinner —their fifth on active ser-
vice.
Though Edward Mitchell, K.C., who has
just been Iv.C.M.G.’d, is a Gumsucker, his
dad, William Mitchell, brought up his son in
the rarest of Fine Old English atmospheres,
so that Edward’s new frill fits him very com-
fortably. The elder Mitchell was fond of
pomp and circumstance. He did the more
public part of his pomping as President of
the Leg. Council: but in private life he also
spread his feathers as a squattocrat of old-
time Kyneton. He ran his stock at Barfold,
and in that fertile region Edward was born
and reared. Of recent years the K.C. has
written copiously for the Conservative press
on political subjects, and his K.C.M.G.-ship
would seem to have floated to him across
that sea of the right-colored ink.
The learned Hodges, of the Supreme
Court Bench, is a knight-bachelor at last, so
that's all right. His handsome lady has
had a distinguished matrimonial career, her
previous choice having fallen on the late
Robert Chirnside. She was originally Alice
Ware, one of the late Joseph Ware’s dozen,
and was “raised” at Minjah, the Ware squat-
tage near Caramut. Howells, of Woorerill,
and Dowling, of Jellalabad, each chose one
from the same prize flock.
The late Flight-commander Alex. Little
(lie won the D.S.O. twice, the D.S.C. three
times and the Croix de Guerre, and was
recommended for the V.C.) was educated at
Scotch College, Melbourne, and was so proud
of his old school that he wore its cardinal,
gold and blue colors on his machine. In one
of his last letters he made the request that,
if he were killed, his- son should be educated
at “Scotch.” He married an English girl a
couple of years ago, and the young widow is
coming to Australia.
Lieut.-Colonel Abbott, M.H.R., indulged in
a hurried handshake on his return from the
Front last week. He was saluted with a
general cheer on his first appearance in the
Reps, after his re-election last year, and was
afterwards bundled off to bury his blushes in
champagne.
Captain McNamara, V.C., of the Flying
Corps, who is at present instructing at the
Laverton Flying School, bumped back to
earth very unceremoniously the other day arid
wondered what part of the map he had landed
on. It was the sleepy little toWn of Yarram,
away up in Gippsland. No bones broken —
just a shake.
Bowes Kelly, though he never seems
rushed, must be a busy man these days. He
is chairman of the Broken Hill Prop, and of
the Colonial Bank: the one is just adding
something like a million and a half to its
capital, and the other is discussing an amal-
gamation with the National.
Mrs. Arnold Westley gave a lunch party
last Wednesday, and then took her guests and
boxed them for the vaudeville matinrie at
the Bijou. Amy Murphy and Newbury were
the attracting stars. Maoriland Amy sang
in wonderful voice and a bepearled pink
gown.
Young Dr. Balcombe Quick has earned the
right to pin the D.S.O. on his chest. He is
the son of W. H. Quick, who has a humpy
at Macedon. His mother was a Miss Bal-
combe, and he calls Mrs. Norman Brookes
cousin. Balcombe surgeoned through the
Gallipoli campaign, and has been in the
Rouen district in France for some time.
Notwithstanding many offensives, he is still
a bachelor.
Miss Adelaide’s miscellany :
Private Hudson, who has just won the M.M., is
one of five brothers, all of whom have been fighting
since the warhounds were slipped. His wife’s five
brothers hold the same notable record, and his
mother-in-law is munition-making’. She’s a chit of
a girl of 67 !
Lieut. Darling, son of the late John, completed
two months’ sick leave in Adelaide the other day
and started back to rejoin the R.F.A. The John
Tennants’ son was a passenger by the same boat.
He prefers to enlist in England, though goodness
knows the Australian boys are calling loudly enough
for help from home.
D.S.O.’s have been bestowed upon Lieut.-Col. Shep-
herd and Major Clayton, both with the A.M.C. since
the end of 1915. A similar distinction came to
Major L. C. Sando, who left here in command of a
Light Horse Brigade Train in 1915. Lieut.-Col. E.
J. H. Nicholson, who enlisted in Westralia, but has
spent most of his life in this State, has been
adorned with C.M.G. His eldest daughter, by the
way,, has just taken her B.A. degree at the Perth
University.
A Roll of Honor, unveiled by the Premier on
Tuesday, shows that 222 good citizens who are now
soldiers or nurses were employed in the Chief Secre-
tary’s and Treasurer’s departments. Altogether
there have been well over 3000 enlistments from
the Service, with the Railways (267 officers and 1685
men) at the head of the list.
W. Henderson, the newly-appointed general sec.
of the Central Council of the Returned Sailors and
Soldiers’ League, hails from up-country, where he
threw up a good legal practice to enlist. He won
his third stripe before being invalided home.
Lieut. Colin Duncan, who was here on furlough in
the Spring after being gassed, has cabled from Eng-
land, where he has been held up as still unfit for
active service, that he is returning to Australia as
A.D.C. to the Gov.-General. His big brother, Capt.
J. G. Duncan-Hughes, has won the M.C.
With luck the State War Council Soldiers’ Hostel
should be ready for opening by the end of the month
or early July. Fourteen hospital beds have been
privately given, a generous example which might
well be copied. '
A Military Cross goes to Hudd, lately a juvenile
member of our Assembly, and another to Harry
Thomson, a former Rhodes scholar and a member
of the law firm of Varley and Evan. Adelaide claims
also an interest in the D.S.O. given to Donaldson,
chief surveyor on Broken Hill Central, and to
Hamilton, assayer for the Zinc Corporation; and in
the Flying Cross that comes to Taplin, whose father
is an Adelaide architect, though the boy enlisted in
Sydney, where he had a job as electrical engineer.
Pauline Curran, the Apple Island daugh-
ter of Curran of Tatt.’s, is spending all her
time on serious trousseau embroidery. Her
fiane#, ex-aide Fitzgerald, has just reached
England, and gossip says that Pauline fol-
lows very soon for the marriage.
A handsome enamelled pendant is among
the wedding presents of a Tasmanian bride-
groom, and it is matched by another already
in possession of the bride. He is Lieut. G.
H. Wilkins, of the Fifteenth, and the gift,
which hangs on a ribbon of purple and white,
is a Military Cross. She won the Royal Red
Cross when she was Sister Estelle Venner
Keogh, of the Australian Army Nursing Ser-
vice in France. They sailed back to Aus-
tralia together last March, and became 1
engaged on the homeward journey. He is a
Devonport (Tas.) lad, and she a Melbourne
lass.
Geoffrey Luttrell has done with fishing,
and he and bride Alys (late Bridges) will
“go into residence,” as they say in Royal
circles, at Trawalla station. Luttrell’s dad,
who is a brother-in-law of the G.-G., owns
an antique humpy, Dunster Castle, on the
smiling downs of Somersetshire, and has a
tinge of the blood of the Plantagenets in his
veins. If challenged he can produce an
analyst’s certificate.
Alys Bridges—now Mrs., Geoff. Luttrell—
set superstition at defiance at her wedding.
She Wore a long black scarf over her gown,
a black hat and a bunch of violets—all
dreadfully unlucky things for a bride to
sport.
Margaret Baskerville, Douglas Richardson
and Miss Primrose —the last the organiser of
the Visiting Trained Nurses’ Association —
have collaborated in a book of verse and
illustrations for patriotic purposes. Seven
hundred are now on sale at Red Cross
centres.
Mrs. Beatrice Higgins, wife of the Judge’s
scholarly brother, who has been giving a
series of patriotic afternoons, has composed
and set to music a War Cradle Song, which
she has dedicated to the memory of her
brother, Commander Shuter, R.N. This song
is to be sung at her “afternoon” this week,
when Lady Stanley is to be present. Mrs.
Higgins’s son is leaving very shortly to join
the Naval Air Service.
State Government House got up a hurried
party for Red Crossers last week. The
pasteboards were labelled “8 till 10.” The
trouble was they couldn’t get the company
away by 10, because the G.-G. wouldn’t go
and allow a general exodus. His Ex. was
enjoying himself talking forestry, and he
talked and talked, while anxious aides
hovered. At last a diplomatic genthelp
gained the ear of Lady Helen. Then she
touched her spouse on the arm and said
“Come,” and he went.
Captain Conant, the Stanleys’ theatrical
aide, is arranging a further sassiety theatri-
cal stunt; this one will be for the Australian
Comforts Fund.
The wives of the City Fathers (one wife
per father) are on the go this month. They
want funds for the Mayoress’s kiosk when
the next Day dawns, so there is to be a card
party in the Town Hall on the afternoon of
June 19. Mrs. Davey (the imposing lady of
the diamond ear-rings) is running it.
Francie Adler (Frances Alda she calls
herself now) has been appearing in a won-
derful dress as Columbia, * and singing “The
Star Spangled Banner,” in the Metrop.
Opera House, New York, for the benefit of
American soldiers.
Alex. Welsh, of Echuca (he has done
some verse for The Bulletin), has com-
posed a “Back to Echuca” song with a cap-
tivating melody. The dogs in ’Chuca are
barking it and the school children sing it
every day. If that doesn’t bring the Old-
timers back to the pleasant Murray town
they’re going to send out drovers with stock-
whips. -
Artist Newbury has been a boom for the
past week, and that distinguished officer,
General Request, has ordered a prolongation
of his show of pictures. Mrs. McCubbin has
enthusiastically taken up the young man.
She gave him a tea-party at the show last
week, and crowds of the Naicest flocked up
the steep stairs. The Bates Post couple
were guests.
Florrie Young startled Collins-street the
other day by tripping along wearing a green
dress with an enormous old-fashioned bustle
and panniers. Then she went to the Town
Hall to watch the latest contingents of Vic-
torians on parade. She waved an enormous
flag and sent forth her singing voice full
speed and pitch. The marching soldiers
joined in the song, and there were cheers
and shouts for Florrie.
Mrs. Brough is busy in England—on the
boards. Her husband, engineer Bell, has
been in France and is now busy in the North
Sea.
The Melbourne Repertorians are feeling
proud of their fellow actor, slim young Lyle
Christian, who has won the Military Cross.
His brother Ken had lots worse luck—he
was killed when his troopship was torpedoed
in the Mediterranean on New Year’s Day,
1916.
Booked for Military Crosses, two brothers,
Captain J. M. Hogg and Captain J. P. Wal-
lace Hogg, sons of the Hoggs of Surrey
Hills, whose country ought to be proud of
them. J.P. came from ’Frisco to Australia
to enlist and went thence to Gallipoli and
France. J.M. has seen three years’ service.
Another son sleeps in Flanders, and the
youngest boy in France. Yet another is
with the 21st Battalion —the crowd that
faced the music on the Southland.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

HOW TO MAKE A GOOD
NON-POISONOUS COUGH MIXTURE.
To avoid the dangers attendant upon the giving to children of cough piixtures
containing such habit-forming opium drugs as paregoric, laudanum and morphia,
parents will be well advised if they make their own family cough mixture from
HEENZO (registered name for Hean’s Essence), which is a compound of non-
poisonous herbal extracts, needing only the addition of warm water and sweetening
to make a most reliable treatment for chest and throat troubles. Each bottle of
HEENZO will make a pint of ready-to-use mixture. A pint of ready-made cough
remedies would cost at least 12/-. HEENZO costs only 2/- (by post, 2/3), and is
obtainable from all leading chemists and stdres, or direct from G. W. Hean,
Manufacturing Chemist, 178 Castlereagh Street, Sydney.
“I NEED A TONIC.”
How often have you heard the remark passed:—“l need a tonic”? If you are
feeling fagged out physically, and your brain won’t act quickly and clearly, you
should not hesitate about taking a course of HEAN’S TONIC NERVE NUTS. They
restore to the human system the elements of healthy nerve tissue, and pure, rich
blood, thereby overcoming lassitude and the hundred and one aches and pains which
afflict the lives of neurasthenic subjects. Hean’s Tonic Nerve Nuts are sold by all
leading chemists and stores, price 3s. per box, or six boxes for 17s. 3d.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSÈD OIL
“T.S.”: Re cormorants. Adelaide Botanic
Gardens have had to get after them with a gun, the
loss of gold-fish and others having been so great
lately. One bird was found to have 27 fish in safe-
leposit.
“Dr. Nil”: “Te Whare’s” reference to
the wood-swallow or bee-bird (B. 16/5/’18) puzzles me.
When I was in N. S. Walea,,years ago I fraternised with
both these birds, and always thought that the wood-
swallow—three varieties—were slate and white in
plumage, and mostly haunted telegraph wires or other
bare perches, and skimmed about in short flights
catching flying insects. The so-called bee-bird or
bee-eater I knew as a green and gold bird with a long
curved beak and two long quills projecting from its
tail. It usually floated about on sunny days utter-
ing occasionally a small, pretty, musical cry. Some
said it ate bees, but Robert Hall (“Useful Birds of
Australia”) says it rarely if ever does. As to court-
ship manners of wild birds, I give the palm to the
dove-pigeon—not mentioned in Hall’s book, by the
way. Ho. 1 sidles up to his lady friend and bows
in a courtly manner, repeatedly remarking “Koo-
coo! Aoo-kitty-coo!” or words to that effect. The
lady looks sideways at him, as a rule, and says,
“Croo!” in a contemptuous voice and turns a scorn-
ful back upon him. Then No. 2 swain comes mincing
up and interposes, bowing and sidling and making
similar remarks to No. 1, and is sometimes allowed
to sit close alongside the lady and whisper in her
shell-like ear—sometimes not. The whole per-
formance is as graceful and polite as an old-time
saraband or pavane. In any case the rejected lover
takes his congee like a knight of the Court of King
Arthur, or even better.
* * * *
Captain White and other S. Aus. natural-
ists are begging the Government to have the lower
end of Yorke’s Peninsula fenced off and kept in its
present wild state as a reserve for native animals.
The whole of Kangaroo Island, just across the gulf,
was supposed to be such a reserve, but the farmers
there made such an outcry about damage done to
crops that they were allowed to kill on their own
land; and the recent production of skins suggests
that the liberty is being abused. On the Peninsula a
straight fence would create a reserve without great
expense.
* * * *
“Killy Kitty”: Let me offer “R.S.” a
helping hand in the matter of tanning kangaroo skins
(B. 16/5/’18). Take a few strips of wattle-bark and
cut into pieces about one inch in length. Boil these
in water with two or three ounces of alum for a
couple of hours. Strain the preparation, and when it
is cold soak the skin in it for 24 hours. This done,
take a smooth stone and rub over the wet hide, which
prevents it becoming hard. Then hang it out to dry.
Repeat the soaking, but do not now apply the stone
until the skin has lost most of its wetness and is just
damp. Then do the rubbing and tack out to dry.
Some tanners soak and rub only once, but I have
always found the leather much softer after double
treatment.
* * * *
“D.F.”: About turtles on the southern
side of Australia (B. 23/5/’18). Ancient chroniclers
record that away back in the ’forties a 3001 b. turtle
was caught in Port Phillip, off Williamstown. Appa-
rently the specimen which Eyre saw at Fowler’s Bay
in 1840 was not the only one that had taken the
wrong turning about that time.
ARS LONGA.
THE CHARMED BILL: “Do it take yer long to learn them there mouth-organs, Charlie?"
THE VIRTUOSO: “Not s’long. The first four or five years is the 'ardest.”
THE DAWN OF HOPE.
JOCULAR BUTCHER: “'Eard the latest, eh? Like feeds like. Eat 'art and you gets
'art. Eat drains and get drains. And so on. Now, what ad out this nice tongue to
take ’ome to the wife?”
MR. MEEKUS : “Eh—you haven't got a frozen one, have you?”
“Leo Lear”: “Jim Ca-rew” (B. 11/4/’IS)
hints that the nest of the “horieysucker” is the best
hidden. I presume he means honey-eaters; but even
then the statement is far from correct, as the family
consists of upwards of 200 species, some of which—
wattle-bird, leather-head, etc. —build homes as con-
spicuous as a calf’s head. Some of the nests most
difficult to find are those of rare birds, mostly scrub
dwellers, and known only to ornithologists. For
instance, the rufous scrub-bird of N. S. Wales, rifle-
bird of Q., and bristle-bird of the Otway ranges;
but of the common birds I place the dwelling of the
brcwn flycatcher as one of the hardest to locate. It
is a tiny edifice built right into the fork of a limb,
and would altogether escape the notice of the keenest
observer if he didn’t watch the bird until it be-
trayed the show. The mansion of the crested shrike
(yellow-bellied shrike-tit, if you please) built among
the top leaves of a giant gum is another hard to find
except by % spying on the owner. Shore birds
are also tough problems when it comes to find-
ing their eggs. They don’t put out much capital on
building material, but the eggs blend so well with
the surroundings as to be almost undistinguishable.
* * * *
How animal life acts and reacts is shown
by R. S, McDonald, of the still-wild S. Australian
country beyond Murray Bridge, who writes that he
lately killed his first snake. He supposes that the
myriad gohannas used to keep them in cheek, but
these have disappeared, probably scoffed by foxes.
Yet McDonald has ho quarrel with the fox, because
it has cleared out wallabies and rabbits, and saved
a big expense in wire-netting.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: “Murua” in his account of
the Trobriand Islands (B. 16/5/’18) is wrong in
saying that the blessings of competition have im-
proved the price of pearls fished by the natives. The
pearl and other trade in the atolls has been for
years in the hands of Greeks, who have become as
firmly established as their compatriots in the Sydney
cray and oyst’ industry. As they are Levantine
Greeks it is easy to realise that competition within
the colony is not likely to greatly benefit the heathen.
The pearl-getting is almost all done by the natives
and the Greeks pass .the goods on to foreign buyers.
Though the fishing is done in the mussel beds —quite
different from the M.O.P. of Torres Strait—very
beautiful blacks, pink and yellow pearls are not un-
common. The star-eyed maidens of the group are
not coy; and the advent of the Greeks did not im-
prove them, so that when at last an R.M. was
appointed he had to be a medical man. What a job
he had in coping with venereal disease may be read
in the Papuan reports 1906-10. The group is remark-
able for the facts that totemism and hereditary chief-
tainship are found there, though little known in
Papua proper. Descent is traced through the mater-
nal line, and the laws as to caste, marriages and
observances are as complex as in better-known lands.
Tbe two aristocratic tribes or castes are folk apart.
They are much bigger and better developed than the
common herd, and for this reason a big man goes
well with the girls. Curious examples of the artistic-
taste of the people are the thick, wooden shields
used for ceremonial purposes. These are carved
and painted with what are practically armorial bear-
ings, blendings and groupings of the family' totems,
etc. Slavery, or at least serfdom, was prevalent, but
has largely disappeared, though the mob still
crouches and crawls in the presence of a chief. The
Trobrianders are or were sea-going traders, building
fine sailing canoes and dealing mostly in the splendid
yams grown on the atolls.
* * * *
“McNorth”: Far Northern Binghi has a
firm belief in blood-letting as a cure for head and
other aches. He makes a series of • incisions about
the pain centre and lets them drain. As the carving
is usually dong, with the more or less sharp edge of
a piece of broken oyster-shell the method is often
successful, the lesser original pain being absorbed in
the greater pain of the treatment. The incisions
always heal cleanly. Yet with a white man an
uncared-for cut by an oyster-shell will in nine cases
out of 10 become septic or something like it, so
it would appear that black brudder is less suscepti-
ble to blood-poisoning than his white relative. Macer-
ated or pounded herbs are occasionally used some-
what in the fashion .of a wet compress, but cupping
is preferred as being more demonstrative, and Binghi
thinks, therefore, more effective.
* » * *
“Batley”: The disease said to be affecting
about 75 per cent, of horses in the Solomon Islands
and mentioned by “Wee Bobbin” (B. 16/5/T8) is
possibly a dermatitis, which is most commonly
known as “summer sores.” These lesions are due to
the presence in or beneath the skin of a worm which
is thought to be the larval stage of a species of round-
worm found very frequently in the stomach of the
patient. It passes part of its life history through
flies ( Muscids ). Although it has not been definitely
proved, it is possible that biting flies ;( Stomoxys )
are responsible for the inoculation of the larvae into
the skin of the horse, where they set up an inflam-
matory condition. If this is true the disease may be
prevented by destroying horse-manure, which contains
the embryos of the said worms and which forms a
breeding-ground for flies.
* * * *
“Binbashi”: Re “John Mac’s” account (B.
10/1/’18) of the use by native medicine-men in the
Islands of extract of convolvulus leaves to procure
abortion. The itinerant native quack in late German
New Guinea retails a prescription intended for a pur-
pose considered not quite the thing in polite society.
The concoction is wrapped in a small portion of
plantain-leaf, and the buck in possession proceeds
to make the charm work by the simple process of
exhibiting it to the chosen belle. Her subsequent
chance of avoiding his ardors is considered smaller
than Buckley’s.

THE SINGLE-HANDED TEAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We’re more than partners, Ned ’n’ me,
Two sections permanently righted.
Yiv seen us on the mooch, maybe,
Like remnants lovin’ly united.
Ned’s on’y got one stump, the left;
By ’appy chance I’ve got its brother.
Of his two dukes he’s been bereft;
My left was mauled, ’n’ had to go.
It fortunitly ’appens, though,
I kept the other.
Aboard there’s me like arf a peach,
’N’ Ned’s the other arf, but soon it
’S borne on us that side by each
We makes a satisfact’ry unit.
A ’andy cobber on the ship
Fakes up for us a set of clutches
That clamps us firmly hip to hip.
In seven minutes we can peg
The mile out on a timber leg
’N’ two steel crutches.
We now go halves, like Si'mese twins,
’N’ as a team I hold we’re bosker—■
The blighter on the street that grins
Has got to deal with Edwin-Oscar.
At balls we two-step, waltz, ’n’ swing,
’N’ proppin’ walls no one has seen us.
W’hen at the bar I never ring
The double on ole Ned. For both
One hand must serve, ’n’, on me oath,
It’s fair between us.
He’s five foot eight, I’m little less;
He’s Roman, I’m a sort of Proddy;
But no sectarian bitterness
Will disunite this sec’lar body—•
We’re hitched for good, we’re two in one.
Our taste’s the same, from togs to tipple.
But, straight, it makes me sad, ole son,
To think if he should croak or me,
The pore bloke what is left might be
A bloomin’ cripple.
VICTORIA.

The fwopefo Engine
is known throughout the length and breadth of
Australia for its great wearing qualities, its good
substantial power and its ease of operation.
Many of them have been in use for ten years and cost less than ten
shillings for repairs. Both the material and workmanship throughout
are the best that money can produce. This sterling quality of
construction and efficiency has created a demand for Cooper Bngines
that enables us to produce and deliver them to you at a price at least
25 per cent, less than any other engine in the same class.
This 4-Brake Horse-power Cooper at £B5 is an example of the
wonderful combination of “Quality and Price” we can offer. It is
powerfully constructed, fitted with fuel pumps, built-in magneto and
the highest quality attachments. Cylinder and valve chambers have
ample water jackets, and the large water tank keeps it cool in any
climate. Anyone can start and run it without difficulty.
It is unconditionally guaranteed to give satisfaction. If you require an
engine, write us full particulars of your work and we will quote you an
outfit to suit your requirements.

HANDICAPPED.
THE LADY: “I'm afraid you're what they call ‘a bird of passage.' Here to-day and
away to-morrow."
THE GENT: Impossible, lady! Why, I ain't got'r bloomin' feather to fly with."
“Tropical Druid” (from the Admiralty
islands) : “Malaria” asks for tips on quinine dosing.
As one who has been many years near the Line I
can say what is the practice of the old-timer to
dodge the tropical fiend—quinine in not less than 10-
grain doses whenever one feels feverish or even “off,”
but at no other times. Anything less than 10
grains has little effect. In many cases one’s stomachic
acidity is not sufficient to dissolve the quinine as
taken in capsules or tablets, in which case it must be
taken ready dissolved in muriatic acid. When one
has actually got malaria, then not less than 30
grains daily; but when there is no fever it is fool-
ish and even dangerous to general health to take
quinine daily as a preventive. I have found that
when one is run down from, say, a few days in an
open boat or marching along the hot beaches, one
is prone to a fever attack. Also excessive
intimacy with John Barleycorn will bring on
malaria; likewise a sudden turning from heavy
drinking to teetotalism will lay one open to it.
Only two things will combat malaria—quinine and
kerosene. Quinine for the sufferer, and kerosene for
the anopheles mosquito larva: in tanks, spoutings,
swamps, etc.

“Dingo”: For hard graft in of food
the cassowary stands alone amongst Australian birds.
In the Bowen district of N.Q., especially during the
dry season, cass. actually hews down small trees and
saplings on the chance of getting a mouthful; and
if, after listening intently, any sign of life or move-
ment is detected in the interior of a log or stump, the
horny axe-like beak is brought into action, and in a
few moments the chips begin to fly. Generally the-
reward for an hour’s yakker is a small grub or
two.

“F.N.T.”: Scott, of Tarradiddle, ordered
six gallons of whisky from a Melbourne wholesaler.
When the keg arrived at Tarradiddle station Scott
gave it a knock and a shake and discovered that it
was only half-full. He refused to take
delivery, and wrote to advise the wholesaler
that the keg had evidently been tampered
with. The wholesaler lodged a complaint
with the Railways Department and told Scott to
send back what was left of the consignment. This
was done, with the Department’s officials inquiring
into the matter all the time it was coming back, no
doubt. When the wholesaler’s driver went to collect
the keg at Spencer-street he gave it a knock and a
shake before signing up; and the only result was a
dry, hollow noise like a keg full of nothing. The
balance of the whisky had gone to make the subject
of still further inquiries.
“Jay Pay”: “H.M.'s” foxterrier bitch
(B. 9/5/’18) is apparently affected with roundworm.
Make up powders as follows: santonine, 3gr.; sul-
phate of iron, 2gr. ; sugar of milk, 20gr. Give one
powder (not the same one) five mornings running on
an empty stomach, following the last with a dose of
castor-oil, containing, say, 10 drops of turpentine.
Repeat the treatment after a fortnight has elapsed.

“George”: He was so emphatic about it
that I’m still doubtful whether he was a liar or
a bishop. With his mate, he explained, he had well
besmeared with bird-lime a young gum upon which
hundreds of cockatoos habitually gathered. Next
morning the trappers went along to collect the catch.
There was none ; but there was a big hole in the
ground where the tree had stood overnight.
MORE WAR-TIME ECONOMY.
“Shave shickshpensh! Thatsh orl verrawell
(hie), hut if I don't span’ it how can
some (hie) other poor f'ler shave it ?”
“Taringa”: No good “H.Y.E.” telling me
that the “bee-eater” is a much-maligned bird. A
more fitting name cannot be found for the pest. The
number of honey-makers it devours in a few days is
sufficient to deplete an apiary. I have examined 32
of them shot since December, and in every instance
found that the victim had dined well on my stock.
* * * *■
“Ornis”: Allow me to add a few words to
those of “Leo Lear” (B. 2/5/’18) concerning the
cormorant tribe and its sins. During various wan-
derings on many islands, mostly uninhabited, in
search of bird-lore, I have poked into sundry smell-
some rookeries of these birds and always found fish
remains scattered about the bulky nests. But in
practically every instance the greater portion of the
captures consisted of either very poor quality fish or
else those we do not consider of commercial value.
Here in the Speck cormorants are anathema, and Is.
a head is given by the Fisheries Department for all
shot op inland waters. As we have plenty of im-
ported trout but no irrigation banks to be destroyed
by yabbies, perhaps it is right to down them when
they are away from their proper haunts.
“Azack”: For scrub-itch try this remedy.
Dab a damp rag on carbonate of soda or washing-
soda and then on to the irritated part of the body.
This is a common means of relieving inflammation
and irritation of the skin caused by plants of various
kinds. By the way, early in 1917, after the Namoi
River had been in flood, a number of scrub-cutters
were engaged cutting doyvn Noogoora burr on the
river’s banks, when they became infected with weep-
ing eczema. In Tasmania, I believe, some of the
hop-pickers cannot follow their occupation owing to
their becoming infected with hop-rash, which is
something similar to scrub-itch. Again, men engaged
in the eradication of stinkwort become infected with
a kind of blood-poisoning, and are sometimes laid up
for weeks.

“E.R.P.”: It has been rumored for years
that Ben Hall and his bushranging’ gang planted
a large hoard of gold and valuables in the Weddin
Mountains (N.S.W.), about 12 miles out of Grenfell
in a south-westerly direction. In 1912 two men,
claiming to be pros-
pectors, and appar-
ently Yankees from
their twang, arrived
in Grenfell, and in-
quired the whereabouts
of a certain spot in
this direction, which
they were trying to
locate from a rough
plan that they had.
An old farmer directed
them to the spot,
which was only a few
hundred yards distant
from his house. They
stayed with him for
three days, each night
leaving at moonrise
with a pick and shovel
and a large suit-ease.
On the third night
they left as usual, but
as they failed to put
in an appearance by
dinner-time the fol-
lowing day, the old
cocky hobbled up to
the place to which he
had directed them.
There he found that a
patch, about 2ft. deep
and 20 yards square,
had been dug up. In
this he found impres-
sions similar to those which would be left by three
oil-drums buried in the ground, and fossicking about
he picked up four or five small nuggets of gold.
Prom that day to this nothing has been heard or
seen of those two strangers.

“Norma”: The blackfellow was scratching
his bump of meditativeness when I came upon him.
“What’s the matter with you, Billy?” I queried.
“Plenty plurry matter, boss. Too many plurry jobs
to do to-morrow. Missah Barnes he want me go
mustering cattle, Jack Kyan he want me ride ta
plurry outlaw, and the missus he die yesserday and
gotta funeral, and I dunno which of ’em to do!”
* * * *
“Smokehouse”: The name “butterfly-fish”
is given in Torres Strait to a small rare fish that
leaves the water and flies, or planes, for some little
distance. It’s flight is slow. The body is about
four inches long, and shaped like a slightly flattened
cigar. A perky little head at the fore-end is held
higher than the back, and, right aft, the freak is
fitted with a tail, shaped like the tail of an aero-
plane. The wings, about three to four inches across,
are butterfly-shape and act as planes only, no move-
ment in them being visible. Body, blade; wings,
spotted black and white. He’s new to me, but
some of the natives know him, though they say that
he is seldom seen. On the drift that I saw this
chap we scooped on board a hefty specimen of the
yellow-and-blaek sea-snake that measured just over
a fathom and a half. They are common enough up
here. The native divers are afraid of them. They
say that the devils twist themselves round a man
when he is down after shell and paralyse him. Per-
sonally I have never known of any such case, nor
have I met any discolored Ananias who has. Still
they all firmly believe the yarn, and it’s just as hard
to knock anything out of their black blocks as it is
to knock anything ipto them.

“Elkieta”: Can emus swim? Well, in
1874 I was travelling from Bourke to Goolwa on the
old Maranoa on a full river, when one morning
about 10 miles below Louth, I saw a flock of seven
large emus coming at a great pace down into a
long narrow bend about a quarter of a mile above
us. It appeared to me that they were being hunted,
and I thought the pursuer would have his picnic in
a few minutes, but the birds kept right on at top
speed, took the water without a halt, climbed the
other bank and raced on across the plain and out of
sight. The river here was certainly 300 or 400 yards
wide and with perhaps a two-mile'-an-hour current.
When in the water only half submerged, and with
head and neck curved like an S, the emus looked like
black 'swans, but they swam much faster than the
latter.

“Half-moon".: On a North Queensland
station a Binghi stockman was dared by some of the
station-hands to imitate the cattle-dog which was
heeling some colts in a stockyard. Without a
moment's thought Binghi crawled through the rails
and approached a colt on hand and knees. In the
fraction of a second the bite was made and the young
’nn galloped to the other end of the yard, leaving
the nig. laughing on his belly and untouched. The
heeler had dodged the flying hoof by an inch or so.
This is straight dinkum, although I see every stock-
man from Normanton to Bourke incredulous.

“S.S.”: Smith was wending his way
homeward after a revel that had lasted all night. He
was in evening dress, and dragging after him a black
overcoat. It may have been that someone had played
a practical joke on him ; at any rate, hanging down
h'.s back on a string was a cold roast chicken intact.
Following Smith was a lanky, mixed-up kind of a
dog in which the wire-haired terrier predominated—
a furtive dog that was conscious of his degradation,
but hungry, very hungry. Every few steps Smith
looked round at the dog, regarding him in a per-
plexed way. Presently they came where Carpenter
was leaning on a gate. “Goo’ day,” said Smith.
“ ’Snice day.” “It is indeed, ’n’ thank you for men-
tionin’ it. Same to you.” Smith paused. Then said
he: “I gotter grea’ favor to ask of you, ole feller.
Who’m I?” “Who are you? Why, you’re Smith—
Mr. Walter Smith.” “I thought so, too,” he said,
and then looked long and thoughtfully at the wire-
haired terrier. “But there must be shome mishtake.
Waller Smith hasn’t gotter dog!”
COOKY,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Greasy he was, so greasy that our eyes
Slipped all roads when we tried to look at him,
But a fair dinkum dab at stews an’ pies,
An’ he’d scratch tucker anywhere, would Jim.
,
So now we picture him with halo bright
In that fair land of which the padres tell,
Robbing St. Peter's angel-roost by night
An’ frying them upon the lid o' Hell,

There’s a LIFE-SAVING POWER about
HEARNE’S
Bronchitis Cure
That makes it NECESSARY in ACUTE Cases.
One Dose of this Wonderful Remedy will very often prove
sufficient if taken at the commencement of a Cold * but the
class of case that HEARNE'S fairly REVELS IN is one that
the ORDINARY remedies have failed to make any im-
pression upon. Herein lies the REAL VALUE of HEARNE’S
BRONCHITIS CURE—a Medicine that can be given with
PERFECT SAFETY and the UTMOST CONFIDENCE to the
YOUNGEST CHILDREN and very AGED SUFFERERS, as it
does NOT contain, and has NEVER contained
any poison or harmful drugs.

the question to me. I said: “Here are two
boys coming out of the library; we’ll take
them as a test.” One lad had a Henty under
his arm; the other—aged 13 or thereabouts
—a book on the Shakspearean cryptogram!
He assured us it was for his own consump-
tion.
It must not be imagined that all our
small visitors require the attention of liquid
soap; we are honored by a cosmopolitan
crowd ranging from the cook’s son to the
Australian equivalent of the Duke’s son.
Rubbing shoulders with Bill, the Duke’s son
is taking a sup of the pori’idge of democracy
that will make him a better man. Quite re-
cently a duke’s son casually mentioned tea
to Bill. Bill as casually replied that as Dad
was out of work there was no tea for him.
Our plutocrat rose to the occasion by pre-
senting Bill with all his wealth —sevenpence.
What Bill’s tea was like we can only
imagine, but it is possible that he did what
another of our small hard-up heroes did when
presented with sixpence—bought a pound of
meat and took it home to mother.
Now that it is possible to approach Bill
and Sis as units, our children’s librarians
are giving them a gentle course in aesthetics
—if such a flowery word can be applied to
such a humble effort. Perhaps Bill does not
know that Julian Ashton lent us six of his
own pictures to decorate the walls of the
library ; but, at any rate, when Bill looks at
the walls lie sees a picture far removed from
anything his own home contains, and he will
see these pictures once or twice a week until
the kindly owner removes them. Then we
4ntend to ourgle another studio. Just now
we are in the midst of an essay competition
on “Which picture do you like most, why
do you like it, and what is the picture
about?” with a pi’ize for the winner. Mr.
Ashton will learn something about his pic-
tures that will refresh him.
On the principle that “No man, having
once tasted good food, or good wine, or even
good tobacco, ever voluntarily turns to an
inferior article,” we are hoping that Bill
and Sis, having lived for a time at least with
'good pictures, will never be quite satisfied
with the inferior article. It is only a hope
at present, but judging from the proprietorial
airs adopted by a newsboy who drops in at
night with his small sister to see that things
are running smoothly, and the appreciation
expressed by a little maid who can only
come in at night because she turns the
mangle by day, the kiddies are happy in
their library.
A wise writer has said : “One gateway to
the heart of a child is always open to us —
that magnificent gateway built of books!”
It is the aim of the Children’s Library, and
of the sympathetic labors of the women in
charge, to keep that gateway free from
weeds, and to open the door into pastures
which will give to the child “never-ending
vistas of delight.”

The Inky Way
“Sparrowhawk”: The elder generation of
inky wayfarers, who remember the bi’illiance
of Frank (“Telemachus”) Myers of 15 or
20 years ago, will be glad to know that his
son, Lieut. Francis Roy Bula Myers, has
come safely back with the D.C.M. He won
it as a sergeant of the 53rd (N.S.W.) Bat-
talion in France at the age of 23, for holding
a line of, trenches for seven hours after his
officer had been wounded, in the face of re-
peated German attacks. The youngster, a
clerk by occupation, enlisted at Liverpool,
and was promoted to sergeant for his excel-
lent showing in a tussle with Abdul.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Apropos The
Omnibus (B. 25/4/’18). This paper was
founded in October, 1841, by Henry Crois-
dale Wilson, who had been in the army and
was a P.M. of Sydney. It appears to have
lapsed in January, 1842. A new series com-
menced on March 11, 1843, but this second
attempt appears to have been short-lived.
Colonel Wilson lived at Victoria Cottage,
Miller’s Point, and at Colne House, Prince-
street, both still standing. The latter he con-
verted into a sort of accommodation-house,
where the knuts of the day, overcome by
their potations, were bedded instead of being
sent to the lockup. The Colonel was also
the first to introduce the four-in-hand coach
to Australia. Not having any horses when
the vehicle arrived, he employed a body of his
police to haul it from the wharf to the police
courtyard. History does not say what
became of that coach.

Books Received
An Anzac’s Bride, by Mrs. Patrick Mac Gill (Her-
bert Jenkins, London), is one of the ills that Bill-
jim suffers: for his fame he has to be allotted a place
in pill ads. and fiction. The sweet young thing with
the flaming red hair, soft brown eyes and milk-white
skin in this yarn could have been anybody’s bride;
for Billjim appears only at the wedding and to
administer the k.o. to the villain. For the rest, the
story tells of what can happen to a girl with red
hair and a strayed husband.
Mulberry Springs, by Margaret Storrs Turner (T.
Fisher Unwin, London).
The Rod of the Snake, by Vere Shortt and Frances
Mathews; Closed Lips, by George Vane; The Great
Gift, by Sidney Paternoster; and The Long Spoon,

“Business, Robbery, etc.
“Rita S.”: I know of a sow that had
litters of 16 for three seasons, and two lots
of 14 and 18 in the one year. Her progeny
brought in over £l5O, and when she ended
up as butcher’s meat she herself brought
in another fiver.

Melbourne’s chief asparagus-growers are
ex-cricketer Frank Laver, of Kew, and
Edward Hunt, of Kooyong. The latter’s farm
on the Kooyongkoot Creek, established half
a century ago on a rich flat, yields most of
Melbourne’s supply; and in early Spring
the nobility of Toorak may be seen any fine
morning moving privily with their baskets
to dicker with old Edward for a few bundles
of his best.

“Sparks”: The other day one of the steam-
ship cos. advertised for a wireless operator.
I applied for the job and learned that what
was wanted was an experienced operator
holding a first-class certificate to take charge
of the apparatus on a new liner. He would
be required to sign on for the trip
to the United Kingdom and return,
and would receive £7 per month. This
means that the wireless operator, who in
these strenuous times often has the safety of
the ship in his hands, is offered a couple of
pounds per month less than a fireman or
second-class steward. I’m beginning to
wonder if expert knowledge is an asset.
* * # *
“Terry Hy Hie”: Those responsible for
the purchase of estates for soldiers’ settle-
ment in N. S. Wales have weird ideas of the
value and productivity of land. Some time
ago a big area that embraced several well-
known Lachlan River properties, including
Iviacatoo, owned by Dick Wootton, was
offered at £2 10s. an acre. The Advisory
Board turned it down on the ground that the
country xy as not even a good grazing pro-
position ; yet at the last Sydney Show Bob
Gibson, who holds part of Kiacatoo, compet-
ing against all Australia, secured three firsts
and a champion for fat bullocks fed on natu-
ral grasses. Of course, it would be great if
we could provide land for . the boys that
would grow ensilage and oil-cake, but it’s
doubtful if it can be done.

“Quidam”: Price-fixing may be all right,
but if somebody doesn’t also fix the diameter
of candles, the wicks will soon have to be
tied on outside. When kerosene is 11s. 6d.
a tin, carbide £BO per ton wholesale, and
candles so attenuated that they cannot cast
a shadow, there would be a good opening for
the old-time fat lamp—only for the dreadful
price of fat. In the old days when fat was
a waste product on Outback stations, all that
one required for an illumination was a jam
tin, a bit of moleskin and some fat. Smoke
and smell were by-products that were thrown
in. But a tentative experiment when the
kerosene-tin unexpectedly ran dry has con-
vinced me that a fat lamp under modern
conditions leads' direct to the Bankruptcy
Court. It wquld be cheaper by fax' to im-
port a whale and instil a wick into him.
What a lot the “good old pioneers” got fox-
nothing ! Even a bullqck-team costs money
nowadays.
* * * *
“X.Y.” : “Smoko” asks why we don’t grow
our own tobacco. Until the excise imposi-
tions of the Stuart Government, in the early
’Bo’s, a good, sound, locally-grown and manu-
factured tobacco could be bought in N. S.
Wales country stores at 2s. per lb. One
point about this industry is that it does not
entail heavy work, and another is that it
does not require a lai-ge area. Given cleared
land, the whole of the work can be carried
out by children or disabled men. Hence,
tobacco-growing, curing and manufacturing,
taken together, offer a better chance of suc-
cess to intelligent repatriation efforts than
any other industry available. Where rich
land is available the area for each settler ox-
family would be small —not more than at
most 20” acres. But it would be foolish to
stop short at growing the leaf, when manu-
facturing offers an easy and lucrative occu-
pation for men who have lost one or both
legs. Where the industry of producing the
leaf is carried on in village settlements, the
conditions would be favorable for the turning
out of a superior finished article, as the leaf
could then be flue-cured, in any weather. A
curing-house could be erected on the co-
operative principle, and this would enable
the growers to turn out the light-colored
leaf so much sought after at present. *
“F.D.” : A Tasmanian officer recently sent
back the label of a jam tin which asserted
that the contents had been inad'e at
Glenorchy, in Tasmania. Incidentally,
he said uncomplimentary things about the
stuff, and expressed a preference for German
bullets. Now, no jam factory has existed at
Glenorchy in modern times ; arid it is 13 or
14 years ago since the jam-making firm men-
tioned on the label had tinned its last boil-
ing at that place. The war has been a god-
send to heaps of people with old stocks on
their shelves. But it is almost too much to
believe that jam had been kept all that time.
It seems more likely that a manufacturer,
frankly ashamed of the stuff he was putting
up, used some ancient labels.
* * * *
The roof over our heads: —
The building trade is shortest just now of roofing
material. Before the war we depended on the
foreign article to keep the weather out, but the Ü-
boat and other circumstances have knocked imports
of slates from £71,*101 in 1912 to £28,361 in
1917, and of tiles from £59,367 in 1912 to £28,045
in 1917. And those figures are deceptive as regards
quantities, for prices in some cases have been more
than doubled.
The chances of getting early supplies at reasonable
prices from overseas are remote; the re-building of
France and Belgium will take all available material,
arid, as a matter of fact, Britain has guaranteed after-
whr supplies for both countries. Unis Australian
industry has been given another lift. Several Com-
monwealth firms have been turning out excellent tiles,
and so far they have got more orders than they
can fill.
The position -with regard to the Australian supply
of slates has hitherto been less satisfactory. Quarries
are, however, now being worked in S. Australia;
another near Goulburn (N.S.AV.) has been re-opened;
and lately a deposit 20 miles from Kempsey, North
Coast (N.S.W.), was pegged out by a Sydney engineer,
who reckons the quality superior to the Italian and
American, and almost equal to the famous Welsh.
Bulk samples are now being tested.
The S. Australian quarries are at Mintaro and
Willunga. The latter are particularly promising.
They were worked as much as 70 years ago, and
there are cottages in the little Hills township which are
still roofed with surface slates put on as far back
as that. The Adelaide Town Hall, the Anglican
Cathedral and the Governor’s residence at Marble
Hill are all roofed with Willunga slates; and some
of these have stood the test of 40 years. The prin-
cipal properties are now owned by Australian Slate
Quarries. They include a quarry formerly known
as the Bangor, butXrenamed the Australian. One
face is 200 ft. wide by 120 ft. deep; and necessary
machinery has been installed. Some of these
Willunga properties were worked long ago by the
Dunstan family; and John Dunstan, for many years
past a Sydney architect, has taken charge as man-
aging director. He has one advantage which the old-
timers didn’t enjoy: a railway has brought the
quarries within about 25 miles of Adelaide.

“F.W.”: Requiring some desk pads I
bought the local stationer’s stock. On the
cover of each pad was printed “100 sheets.
I counted several of the blocks and the highest
number of sheets was 75. At the same time
I bought a line of note-book refills— lw
sheets.” The best ran to 96. I didn t com-
plain, feeling sure that the manufactureis
were insuring soldiers or something.
DERELICT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Away from the docks where the crippled crocks
Of worn-out windbags ride,
An old hulk broke her cable yoke
And drifted down the tide;
Beyond the bay where green meets grey
She slanted southerly,
Telling the gale an ancient tale
The wind-witch told to me:
No more she’ll ride the harbor tide
In a dingy cloud of coal-dust
To scullery-maid the steamer trade
Which swept her off the sea,
A smouldering shell where cockles dwell,
Rotten with wrack and hold-rust;
For the sea-gods heard her pleading word
And flung her fetters free.
For all the lands manned by her hands
And served with zeal unfailing,
For all reward she brought her lord
And the love she gladly gave,
For all she fared, for all she dared,
Through forty years of sailing,
She reaped in age the niggard wage
And prestige of a slave!
Her sticks are shorn and bulwarks torn,
And the scroll-work aft is tattered,
Her clean-carved bow -disfigured now
By a fractured figurehead;
But what recks she the majesty
That thankless people shattered,
When the winsome maid, opce more sea-sprayed,
Has wakened from the dead!
Wakened at last to deeds long past
Of the rattling, battling sail-days,
When clippers paid in the long-run trade
And steam was classed obscene;
Sailing away to the farthest bay,
Their advent making mail-days—
She was as fleet as she was neat,
And, in her right, a queen!
Borne by the breeze o’er the seven seas
With the soul of a merry rover,
Free as the birds or the prairie herds,
And keener in the chase;
Speeding her flight in flowing white,
Courted the wide world over,
As the fairiest maid that e’er displayed
A limb of shapely grace.
Nor bears she back to the tropic track
Old Neptune’s nymphs a-courting,
With moonsails high against the sky
And stun’s’ls all adraw ;
With the Jimmy Green ballooning clean,
And her nostrils gaily snorting
Where the bow-wash breaks to phosphor flakes,
And the long swell makes her yaw;
Where the Tradewinds croon their long low tune
When the mellow moon is shining,
And the pairs advance in the festive dance
Or coo in the cro’jack shade;
Where an impish ray of silvern spray,
With a mischievous designing,
Would blight the bliss and curb the kiss
’Tween love-lorn man and maid.
Nor fares she forth to her native North,
Where the Great Bear lamps are blinking ;
And the Channel lights like jewelled sprites
Glint gold on Night’s dark gown;
Opening the gate through Dover Strait,
With the Goodwins slily winking,
And marking the way past reef and cay
To the lights o’ London Town.
But towards the South she points her mouth
For the zone of the ’Forties Roaring—
Where the Cross rides high in the cold night sky
And the wild west wind comes fair;
Through hail and gale to the beaten trail
Where the albatross is soaring;
With a bone in her mouth she is slanting south—
Her heart was ever there.
Seeking, the ways of olden days,
Where the fleet maids met in battle,
Hearing again the loud refrain
As the sailors trim her gown,
Feeling the chocks and the chatt’ring blocks
Running their rattle-rattle,
: And her fore-foot lift to the sheet’s long drift,
Trampling the Easting down.
Old tracks worn white by many a flight
Of the lissom-lined Blackballers,
Where the Cutty Sark, the Lightning spark,
And Thermopylae fleeced the foam;
Thither to ride the Great South tide,
Which served the swift Blackwallers,
Till the seagods all send the last long call
That brings all rovers home.
And there on a bright, cold, cloudless night
When the western wind pipes merry,
With the old-time creak from poop to peak
Thrilling her weary bones;
As the sirens play death’s chantey lay
On the harps of Mother Carey,
She will roll and go to a watch below
In the port of Davy Jones.
SOMEWHERE AT SEA.

GIVE YOUR NERVES THREE GOOD
MEALS A DAY.
PHYSICIANS SAY PHOSPHATE
MAKES THE NERVES STEADY AND
STRONG.
Phosphate is the natural food of the
nerves, and the form they most readily
absorb and transform into vital nervous
energy is known as 6 itro-phosphate. You
can get Mtro-phosphate from your chemist
in the form of 5-grain compressed tablets,
and if you take one of these tablets imme-
diately after each meal you will provide
your nerves with the nourishment they need
so badly. Feed your nerves and they will
become steady and strong, and as your nerv-
ous strength increases so your general
health will improve. Your brain will act
quickly and clearly, your eyes will grow
brighter, your step will become firmer and
your cheeks will glow with health. Languor,
lassitude, weakness and depression will be
overcome and a decided increase in vigor and
vitality will be quickly noticeable. — Advt.

POLITICAL
POINTS
ELECTION-NIGHT.
[For The Bulletin.]
A street. The tinsel of electric-light.
A polling-board aloft. A coterie
Of people swanking on a balcony.
An angry crowd below. Eyes flashing bright.
Great voices roaring to the roof of night.
A gust of missiles. Intermittently
of laughter floating free.
And, over all, the stars in flight on flight.
And jerked and jostled by the surging crowd,
A tattered woman, weary-eyed and bowed
By overwork and overweight of woes,
Mumbles and dreams of brotherhood and love;
While, leaning from the balustrade above,
The country’s portly ruler thumbs his nose.
MAORlLANn. BARTLETT ADAMSON.
A large section of the community says it
.objects to titles; but it cheerfully grabs the
chance to knock off work to celebrate the
birthdays of two titled persons, the King
and the Prince of Wales.
Pacifists and pro-Germans will now agi-
tate for a “mutual cessation of air raids on
towns outside the actual area of warfare.”
The fact of course is that Huns can’t make
“reprisals” on America for the damage done
to Germany by a fleet of airships; hence
the humorous demand for cessation of
attacks in which the German must come off
second-best. Air-raiding is the Allies’ trump-
card, consequently the prayer of the enemy
will be “No trumps!”
Prime Minister Hughes keeps on his royal
progress with his suite, including his
advance agent, his press agent, his advertis-
ing agent, his stage-manager, his scene-
shifter and his limelight man. Also Minister-
for-the-Navy Cook keeps on his humbler way
with his suite. The latest news from them
is that they propose to establish permanently
a High Commissioner at Washington
(U.S.A,). But not a word about establish-
ing permanently a High Tariff in Australia.
Yet evbn Cook ought to be able to see by
this time that if there is work for an Aus-
tralian Commissioner in the U.S.A. it is be-
cause the U.S.A. has manufactured things
and attracted millions of people while Aus-
tralia has imported them and attracted mil-
lions of debt.
THE BOOT INQUIRY.
There teas an old woman who lived in a shoe,
The children she didn’t have will he found
in the cemetery on the left-hand side of
the picture.
Griffith, C.J., and Barton, J., the one 73
and the other 69, are both very sick men
these days; and the question of pensions for
High Co lift judges cannot be deferred much
longer. If any man in public employ ought
to have a pension that man is a judge. The
public interest demands it. The only argu-
ment against the practice is that judges are
paid a very fair salary and they ought to
put some of it by. This means inevitably
that they must be concerned in certain in-
vestments and be more or less dependent
upon certain vested interests; and that in
itself is objectionable. To assure the abso-
lute independence of judges the State must
do the investing for them and guarantee them
a pension or annuity-. If there is no pro-
vision of that kind the public interest is
almost bound to suffer also through judges
sticking to their jobs and their salaries long
after they have ceased to be physically and
mentally fit. This is particularly dangerous
so far as a final court of appeal is concerned ;
for the errors made there cannot be erased
even at the cost of much money.
A remark about the relative cost of
government in N. S. Wales and Victoria,
and the fact that Victoria is the only State
which is making ends meet this year, aroused
Premier Holman to defend himself by point-
ing out that N. S. Wales spends £lOO,OOO to
£150,000 a year on returned soldiers, while
Victoria doesn’t. But it isn’t small things
like that about which people complain.
What they remark is that the first Govern-
ment Holman was in increased the expendi-
ture by £769,388 in its first year; by another
£1,469,463 in the next year ; and by a further
£1,521,499 in the third year. Then Holman
became Premier instead of second in com-
mand, and bumped up the expenditure by
£903,351; then by £233,897; then by
another £996,066; next by a further
£1,809,812. This prodigal habit began four
years before the war started, and it is child-
ish to explain an addition of £7,703,476 to
the annual expenditure by saying that
£lOO,OOO to £150,000 a year—about one-
seventieth part of the whole —has gone to
the soldiers.
The Hun dream of the com-
merce of the world leads him to snake war
on the commerce of neutrals and bellige-
rents alike; for if a neutral country has been
booming through the temporary lack of com-
petition, it may be many times more danger-
ous when peace comes than the battered and
exhausted ex-belligerent. South America
was the one whole continent which tried to
stand out. Its ships were therefore sunk
impartially “in mistake”; in fact some in-
tercepted documents of the brutish German
Minister to the Argentine revealed that he
had advised that when Argen-
tine ships were sunk it should
be a total disappearance, as sur-
vivors would explain the sinkage
and make trouble. Then strike
troubles began to spread like a
pestilence under the guidance of
new leaders who rose to sud-
den eminence , and preached
almost undisguised civil war as
the only means of throwing off
“the yoke.” With commerce
being drowned on the sea, and
industries being paralysed on
land, Governments began to
search into the sources of in-
come to these enthusiasts. The
Hun ramifications that were
stumbled on were astonishing,
and the number of blameless-
looking citizens who were found
ramifying passed belief. The
verdict was that the Hun wants
a crippled globe—all except his
own territories—-so that the way
may be easy when he is able to
resume business, and that the nations which
don’t take earnest thought for the morrow
may have a very poor morrow when it comes.
Ih N. S. Wales alone 26 engines a month
are, till the war is over, to become deadheads
and so much Scrap-iron because of the short-
age of spare parts for repairs. It is a cheer-
ful outlook for Cocky; and already the pro-
duce forestalled have bounced up prices to
consumers. Many of the public thought that
N. S. Wales made locomotives; all it ever
did was to put imported parts together, and
we are paralysed if Pommy, the Yank or the
Hun fails to spoon-feed us. Of course, we
could make all the spare parts required; but
who is going to put down the necessary
plant till he has a guarantee that after the
war he will not be undersold by free im-
ports? And apparently, rather'than give
that guarantee, the Federal Government will
see Australia humping bluey.
Apropos the recent 24th of May celebra-
tion, why shouldn’t we have a little affair
of our own on Thomas Mellwraith’s birth-
day? As regards the late Victoria, people
remember her pride in her daughter’s
Prussian marriage and in her grandson
William the Horrible; they remember her
almost lifelong German adviser whom she
kept on the premises, Stockmar; they recall
the bitter complaint of one-time Prime
Minister Aberdeen that the Prince Consort’s
whole policy (at this time the Queen and
her husband practically ran the foreign
policy of the country between them and
insisted on being consulted on every des-
patch ) was a struggle to promote a- German
empire with Prussia at the head of it; and
there is still a memory of the letter which
Albert the Good wrote to the King of
Prussia urging him to join in the Crimean
war and get the western Russian provinces
as his share of the reward. The best that
can be said for the estimable Queen was
that there were plenty of people equally
shortsighted. To the day of her death in
1901 she apparently saw no Hun menace
on the horizon, though it loomed large
enough. But Thomas Mcllwraith, in Bris-
bane, recognised the footfall of Fritz all
about the Pacific as far back as 1883, and
when the British authorities refused to hear
anything he annexed all of Papua which
wasn’t already Dutch, so that Hans Schmidt
might not be within gunshot of Australia.
Queen Victoria’s Government promptly dis-
avowed the act lest the Hun might be
offended, but by great persuasion a bit was
saved out of the wreck. Brother Hun took
the rest.' Mcllwraith was something of a
prophet, but his imperial mistress didn’t
understand prophets.
/Somebody ought to explain this. When
the farmers alleged that they were being
mercilessly fldeced in the matter of wheat-
freights, Hughes answered that “there is not
a Blue Book rate for wheat from Australia.”
Now the Times “History of the War” (vol.
XI, page III) says that, in the autumn of
1916, Mr. Runciman announced that “a
large purchase of Australian wheat had been
made, and that a number of steamers had
been requisitioned to load wheat in Aus-
tralia at Blue Book rates.” Somebody’s repu-
tation is going to look no better when this
wheat business is cleared up, if it ever is.
Meantime the gagging of the farmer’s repre-
sentative on the Australian Wheat Board
doesn’t improve the smell around the wheat-
stacks.
“The German is always hating ‘some-
body or something. He must hate to be
happy.” —James W. Gerard, formerly V.S.
Ambassador at Berlin.-
Thank Heaven, we are making some pro-
gress. Judge Therry, in his “Reminis-
cences,” states that in the early ’fifties wheat
was imported to Sydney from Chile, and the
Freetraders of the day contended that home-
grown grain would never be able to com-
pete successfully with the Chilean article.
WHERE IT HURTS.
Intoxicating liquor is to be barred to patients in
military hospitals on leave. To be distinguished they
will wear a blue arm-band on each arm of their coat
or tunic.
“I wonder how long you will suffer from the
effects of your wound.”
“ Dunno. But as long as I ’ave this blue
ribbon on me arm at any rate.”
“Simmer” : The Australian glass trade is
closing by instalments, though the demand is
greater than ever it was. We have the fac-
tories, the machinery and the men, but lack,
it is alleged, raw material. Glass is made
from sand, lime and soda ash. The two former
we have in abundance and .of superfine
quality, but our soda ash —a salt product—
is imported. We’ve got salt of our own, but no
industrial initiative, thanks to a long course
of Freetrade. With a high tariff, when the
TJ.S.A. want something, or when somebody
makes them think they want something, the
first thought is of how and where it can be
produced in the country. In Australia that
habit doesn’t exist; we simply turn to a
directory and look up an importer’s address.
Though Roumania lias bought peace at
the sacrifice of almost everything it has, with
a promise to pay £400,000,000 in the future,
the Hun, like the spirit of John Brown, goes
marching on. He has appointed a committee
of 370 to run the country—seven obscure
Laborites and 363 other persons that he
can rely on. All the prominent Laborites
have been arrested in one act. That is why
the seven are obscure. The others were
arrested for making the Hun tired with
gush about “brotherhood.”
The Holman Government has reformed
suddenly and taken two steps to improve
matters in the N. S. Wales cockying indus-
try—guaranteeing 4s. per bushel, payable
on delivery, for the coming crop, and making-
advances on land turned up to fallow for
PHILIP O. FYSH, ex-Premier, ex-Treasurer,
ex-Almost Everything Else of Tasmania.
the 1919-20 crop. Half the trouble in the
wheat industry, resulting in many abandon-
ing the business, and others enduring un-
necessarily rough times, has been due to the
system of doling out small payments for the
commandeered wheat. The promise of prompt
payment comes too late to do much good this
season; but the advance of ss. per acre on
land turned up to fallow during the winter,
besides being a godsend to many a cocky
who has lately had to leave the farm and
earn a few pounds to keep the pot boiling
while waiting for the crop to grow, ought to
produce better and more profitable crops
next season.
Compelling arguments in favor of the new
Queensland law relating to the marriage of
diseased persons are contained in the report
of the committee of experts appointed by
the Vic. Government to inquire into matters
relating to syphilis. It is stated that a
syphilitic, aged 33, now at Langwarrin
camp, who married 14 years ago and had
suffered from the disease a year previously,
is the father of eight children, five of whom
were stillborn and the other three syphilitic.
Out of 1001 conceptions in 150 families
showing evidence of syphilis the committee
found only 210 children born ali’ve and so
far healthy.
A FEW REMARKS FROM THE FRONT LINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Con’t wake up, Australia,
Glorious land of Hope!
Don’t you let them rouse you,
Just lie down, and dope;
Dreaming dreams of Freedom,
Mixed with dreams of sport,
Of pleasures Peace will bring you
When she shall reach her port.
Forget your little army,
It’s mostly wild black sheep—
Yes, damn your little army;
Have another sleep!
Nations are lilie humans;
Some are sure, but slow;
Some are energetic,
And want to boss the show.
Don’t you —be apathetic ;
Fill up with empty hope.
Don’t you wake up, Australia,
Just lounge about —and dope.
And when these other nations
Kill us, your wild black sheep,
It won’t hurt you, Australia:
You’ll pass hence in your sleep.

ing against gambling at patriotic carnivals, and
working in the old, old Bible bluff:—
“Many are the people who have come from certain
of these fetes appalled at the audacious exploitations
by means of raffles, etc., whereby exorbitant sums
are collected for articles of comparatively nominal
value.... Apart from the condemnation of the
Sacred Word, with its warnings of inevitable judg-
ment where evil is persisted in, our eommonsense and
God-given instincts surely tell us it is high time
we braced ourselves for loftier standards.”
Whereupon a Melbourne merchant wrote requesting
the Six Saints to quote any portion of the Sacred
Word condemnatory of Red Cross raffles. And, lo i
they either searched the Scriptures and drew a blank
as regards the alleged sinfulness of the spinning-
jenny, or else they knew they were beaten and didn’t
trouble to search. Anyway, they shrank into silence
and allowed judgment to be given against them.
Their talk about “the condemnation of the Sacred
Word” was simply audacious bluff. As a matter of
fact, the Bible has never a text against lotteries,
betting, comic-operas, card-playing, Sunday joy-rides
m motor-cars, or many other of the sins that the
late John Wesley invented for business purposes.
As for dancing, the Sacred Word positively barracks
for the vile frivolity. All things considered, the
Bible is full of discomfort for the very wowsers who
profess to fly to it for consolation in time of trouble.

The Full Court of Vie. last week upset the
conviction of a hotelkeeper at Neerim South who had
been fined for “permitting certain persons to play
an unlawful game” on the premises. The certain
persons had been playing poker. The magistrate
had held that poker was not lawful. On appeal
the question for the Judges was whether the game
itself was one of chance, played with “instruments
of gaming,” not whether Bung had allowed unlawful
playing. Apparently if the magistrate had found
that a pack of cards was an instrument of gaming
and that in common knowledge poker is a game of
chance within the meaning of the Police Offences
Act, the conviction would have been sustained. But
on the finding, their ’onors were limited to the
simple issue and they held that poker-playing was
not necessarily an offence within the meaning of the
Act. If this judgment is interpreted by Bung gen-
erally to furnish judicial permission for setting up
a Jack Pot as a regular part of the business, Bung
will be making a big mistake. There can be no
doubt about it that the law did not and does not
contemplate poker-playing in pubs. There are 175
reasons why this should be so, apart altogether from
the conclusions arrived at by legal dialecticians
about chance and skill. Poker is a gambling, game
—and a red hot one, too.
Of course skill comes into poker. Playing on the
level the player with the clearer judgment of values
and chances and discernment of the others’ methods
will win—provided he gets the paper. But the
element of pure chance is tremendously strong. And
on this point the observations of Justice Cussen are
deserving of hilarious attention. Cussen, J., rambled
at great length about the “dodges” of the footballer,
the variation in delivery by a bowler, the stealing
of runs by a batsman, the versatility of a tennis-
player’s strokes and the advantages a chess-player
could get by making an opponent misjudge what
he intended to do with the bishop. All this was to
show some sort of connection between these artifices
and drawing two cards or sitting pat with kings up.
The Judge’s analogies are not analogies at all. There
might be something in them if Cussen, J., produced
a team of footballers addicted to drawing to decade
whether they went on the field with one leg each
or whether the other side had its hands tied behind
or had to play on crutches. And chess might bear
some resemblance to poker if one player started
without pawns and opened with four queens. Among
alert players there is not much distinction between
poker and hazards or two-up, and a player who is
not alert might as well hand in his socks at the
start and go home to bed.

N. S. Wales National Coursing Assoc, ran
off its Champion Cup meeting on Woodstock En-
closure, Rooty Hill, last week-end. For the Cham-
pion Cdp Beauty Spot was always a hot favorite,
the best price on offer being 6 to 4 on, straight out.
After she had passed out the Derby winner, Rowdy
Micky, in the first round, 10 to 1 on was the best
available. In her two next courses she beat Little
Wap pi ng and Tarcisius, both good dogs. Then the
stake was hers and the books thankfully started on
a new page. Another event decided at the meeting
was the Thorne Stakes, won by Shy Mary (White
Hope—The Bride) from Black Silk (White Hope—
Black Wattle). Before the final the Shy Mary pro-
prietary wanted to divide the stake with the Black
Silk crowd, who whispered “nothing doing.” But
Mary never gave them a hope.
Although S. S- Bennett, of Rooty Hill, has been
an ardent courser for many years, he never ran a
brindle dog before last week. This was Brit-
ling, by Benediction—All British, a runner in the
Thorne Stakes. There were 13 in the family. The
first whelped was a brindle bitch ; then there were
11 blacks; the last was a brindle dog—Britling.
Benediction, who won for Bennett the Champion Cup
of 1915, was a hard black in color, as was his dam,
Black Cygnet. His sire, White Hope (imp.), is,
however, brindle, and it is from him that Britling
inherited the. color scheme. The Bateman Shield, a
fearsome-looking piece of furniture, resembling a deco-
rated coffin-lid, is now Bennett’s property in fee sim-
ple. Years, ago the shield was donated to the N. S.
Wales National Coursing Association by Jack Bate-
man, who kept a Sydney pub. John directed that
it was to .be held by the owner of the winner of
the Chamnion Stakes from year to year, and had to
be won three times by any one owner before becom-
ing his property. Numerous well-known coursers
had a leg-in for the trophy, and in 1915 Bennett got
his first win for the shield with Benediction. Last
year he won again with Beauty Spot, and this year
he won with the same bitch. Consequently he takes
the coffin-lid.
* * * *
Sydney punters met a new one on Satur-
day, and most of them didn’t know anything about
it until the proceedings were over. But those who
did helped themselves with both hands. One of the
starters in the Flying at Canterbury Park was Lord
Bardolph, a four-vear-old gelding from the dam of
Malt King. He came from Bananaland and had
never before been heard of, and, ridden by an appren-
tice, escaped notice, the public being too busy
struggling to get on Eulacre at 9 to 4 and 2’s, anil
Herbie and Goorianawa. But money was coming
for him from the right place all the time at 12’s
down to s’s. It was an easy win. Lord Bardolph
enjoyed a quiet youth, having had only two previous
starts. He looks like being heard of again. C.
Barnes owns him.
* * * *
There are not many better or more un-
lucky sprinters in Australia than Some Boy, who
shifted from the ponies last year to Randwick. Nor
are there many on which punters have lost more
money, for every time he has started he has been
solidly backed. After winning a Flying at Randwick
in December he ran second in the Challenge and
subsequently ran numerous more seconds and thirds,
varied by a win at Moorefield last month. On Satur-
day the little fellow was a starter with 9st. 51b. in
the Club Handicap, 1J mile, at Canterbury Park.
There was a big field of fair second-raters. He won
easily. How he would get along over a distance
with nags of his own class remains to be seen, but
even with them the handicappers wouldn’t be giving
anything away. They keep him well set. Some Boy
has always been ridden by the same lad—the owner’s
son. It would interest some people to see another
horseman on top.
* * » *
Biplane, of Maoriland, was at Randwick
again last week. Mason will get him ready for the
proceedings in the Spring—for short courses,
apparently. The colt has thickened a lot since
Derby-time.
* * * *
Bracken and L. H. Walker were making a
good race of it for the winning-jockey belt this
season in N.S.W., with some of the advantage to
Bracken owing to Walker having had to stand down
for a couple of months. But Bracken is playing
fair. He had his appendix dug out last week. So
Walker can go on with the pegging while the other
one gets better. As he is only three down it looks
odds on.
* * * *
Though a Sydney paper made graceful ref-
erence the other evening to a “Newcastle-trained
gelding jockey” having been on the winner, the
books were ready to give a shade of odds it wasn’t
true. But it was well meant.
* * * *
“T. 0.1.” : Tom Payten, of Randwick, has
sold his Newmarket stables to William Inglis & Co.,
and will probably retire from training. Tom’s
record is a grand one. He prepared “Kirkham”
White’s horses when Tom Hales was chief jock, for
that ancient and eminent stable. Kirkham was a
grant to John Oxley, Surveyor-General in Mac-
quarie’s time; and so far back as Christmas Day,
1827, the pioneering Rev. Thomas Hassall drove
from Cobbitty to Kirkham and held service in the
loft over the stables. Some 50 assigned servants
attended. One of Payten’s charges, the great Chester,
is buried near by; there is a handsome inscribed
headstone to mark the grave.
* * * *
“Trot” : Heaven may know how long it is
going to be before the N. S. Wales Government
discovers that a totalisator system which pushes over
to the backer of a dividend-payer less money than
he staked is a farce, but nobody else does. It
happened five times at Canterbury Park on Satur-
day, twice recently at Warwick Farm, twice at
Randwick a fortnight ago. In addition, there were
several occasions on which the backer only got back
his money. There may be a jocular side to such
proceedings, but it is horribly expensive. Ikey as
a place fielder has done some weird things in com-
piling a price list, but be never yet had the nerve
to offer to pay out less than the punter dropped into
the bag. The worst he ever did was to field
against the winner on the basis of the punter not
losing if his horse ran second or third.
* * * *
“Mujik”: Anyone who went to the A.J.O.
winter meeting with £1 10s. and backed three horses
on every event the first day, and incidentally every divi-
dend-payer, would have gone home with £29 19s. 6d.
more than he started with. There were 16 dividend-
payers, which means that this particular punter
landed the odds of 20 to 1 that he got the lot.
Well, it may be all right if .you keep on doing it,
but there were any number of places where he could
have got 50 to li that he couldn’t pick even two
winners. I don’t know what the right odds would be
against picking every dividend-payer that day, but
2000 to 11 would have been a safe wager for Ike to
lay.
* * * *
“Trot”: At tlie A.J.C. Winter meeting
three races were thrown away by indifferent riding.
In two of them the races were lost because of
riding that was downright bad. Now, it seems to
me all wrong that this sort of thing should pass as
part of the game. For some offences a jockey is
promptly fined; for others he may be ■ given a
holiday or pushed out indefinitely. But he may
show the grossest incompetence and yet go on riding.
It is unfair to owners, trainers, nags, the public and
other horsemen. Wherefore I beg to move that the
stipes be empowered on a first offence to publicly
warn a jockey to do better, on the second to give
him a spell for a post-graduate course or something,
and on the next to hand him a diploma for use
somewhere else. Then the promising apprentice who
really can ride would get more chances and a better
training.
* * * *
Majella, winner of a handicap at Ballarat
(Vic.) last week, has been at the stud and had a
foal to Maltfield. As she ran five furlongs in “4”
her family experience didn’t do the lady much harm.
* * * *
According to Jowett, in the House of
Reps., there is less horse-racing in Victoria than in
other States. Queensland has nearly twice as many
meetings per annum, and N. S. Wales more than 21
times as many.
* * * *
Alan Selman, who died the other day at
Ferntree Gully (Vic.), where he had been a settler
for over half a century, was a leading figure on the
turf during the ’seventies and ’eighties. In addition
to owning and training his own horses he was associ-
ated with the late James Paterson and was very
successful. But he suffered heavily when the land
boom broke, and for 25 years had only looked on at
racing from afar.
* * * *
Bloomfield and Bradfield, representing
Robinson and Clark at the Adelaide Birthday Cup
meeting, seemed to think they had a mortgage on
the principal event, and scratched Elsdon, Adelaide
Cup and w.f.a. winner, on the morning of the race,
to rely on the disappointing Escomb, with just one
maiden event to his credit. However, long previous
notice had been given of the scratching as probable ;
and, in any case, ante-post betting is illegal in S.
Aus. The public did not care for Escomb, and voted
for Rosanna, Shacko and High Tension; but backers
of these didn’t know much about it. William the
Silent made most of the running, but the little local
horse Wee Gun came with a successful run at the
finish and had a dramatic win. At the back of the
course he was nearly down, in some heavy going.
Hopwood (who rode last year’s winner also) lost
his stirrups, but came again, and the little horse
came with him. The weight was 9st. 21b., and the
time, 2min. 35sec., a local record. There was an-
other record on the final day, when Hawker’s Boon-
tree won the Alderman Cup, from Wishing Cap and
Rosanna, If mile in 3min. 2sec. The old Victorian
hurdler Foin won the Steeple. In the three days
over £65,400 went through the totalisator, which
is more than at the Adelaide Cup meeting just
before, and has only been surpassed away back in
1912. The main feature of the whole Autumn
campaign in Adelaide was the marked success of
local owners.
* » * *
Wee Gun, the Adelaide Birthday Cup
winner, illustrates the advantage of not running a
horse to pieces as a two-year-old. He did not race
at all till the end of his three-year-old season, and
was nearly at the end of the next before he won a
stake worth £lOO. At five and six he has been
brilliant. He is very small, but willing, was bred
by squatter-politician John Lewis and leased to
Gregory, who trains him; and stable gossip credits
him with being, or being due to be, a father.

By annexing the English Derby Gains-
borough made his owner, Lady Douglas, the first
woman to own the winner of this race. Gainsborough
was bred by the lady and sired by Bayardo from
Rosedrop, a St. Frusquin mare with a Trenton
mother. He is trained by Alex. Taylor, who turned
out Gay Crusader to win the Derby last year for
A. W. Cox, from Broken Hill.
* * * *
Sparks began to fly from the start when
Sid Godfrey and Wal Scutts collided at Sydney
Hippodrome last week. Up to half-way through the
fourth session Wal was getting none the worst of
it. Thence onward there was the melancholy spec-
tacle of Wal hitting the floor with frequent bangs.
Before the adjournment for a massage Godfrey
clipped him on the chin and when he arose dropped
him twice in the same place. In the fifth stunt it
happened three times again. Early in the sixth he
was downed some more. Whereupon D. Smith, Esq.,
held that the dropping had gone far enough and
told Scutts to drop out. The young man’s main
defect is that his friend Mr. Godfrey has too' much
h.p. in his delivery department.

N. S. Wales Rugby League football this
season is afflicted with the jumps. : Balmain (pre-
miers for the past two years) were early in the lead.
South Sydney pulled them down and sprang in front.
Since then South has been crumpled by both Western
Suburbs and Glebe, and Balmain has rushed up top
again, with three-parts of the compass—-South, West
and East—two points away. This dragging down
and jumping up is establishing healthy conditions at
the gate. In six matches, McPherson (West) has
landed 11 goals and scored two tries; Harold Horder
(South), eight tries and nine goals. Wally Messen-
ger had nine goals and one try when he adjourned to
get a collar-bone repaired.
Parramatta riflemen have a patent for
finding the target. Recently the A team won the
Metropolitan (Sydney) District Rifle Union cham-
pionship with 2844 points—7s less than the record
of the club in winning last year’s championship.
Last week they gathered up the miniature rifle cham-
pionship for the third successive year. Skipper G.
L. Ardill’s 365 out of 420 is the best aggregate of the
season.
* * * *
R. J. Roberts, of the Sydney Registrar-
General Rifle Club, kept his eye in at Randwick range
on Saturday by knocking 37 chips off the bull’s-eye
at 600yds. Of this run, only seven were counted in
the shoot, and J. Helsham’s “double possible” of
70 was acclaimed a better club effort. Roberts’s 37
is the best on Australian record books at 600yds.
At 500yds. E. Rowling’s (Wingham) 62 bulls,
in 1910, is mentioned first.
* * * *
R. J. (Jack) Massie has got the D.S.O.
Perpendicular, he is 6ft. 4in., and any way you like ;
to measure him 100 per cent, grit; in athletics he
has been a Ma State rep. at Rugby Union football
and cricket, and won the N.S.W. amateur heavy-
weight boxing championship; in war, he has been
in three casualty lists (he was dangerously wounded
at Lone Pine) and last year was decorated with the
Croix de Guerre. In 1913-14 Sheffield Shield Cricket
the great left-hander took 31 wickets at 18.25 —
second only to J. N. Crawford’s 33 for 17.03; and
in Sydney premiership cricket in the same season
he had the most-wickets record —69 at 10.37. He
is a son of H. H. Massie, who tripped with Billy
Murdoch’s ’B2 Australian XI, and grandson of T. A.
Dibbs, the G.O.M. of Sydney banking.
* * * *
Two familiar names appeared in a list of
recent recruits to the A.I.F. at Orange (N.S.W.) —■
Alec Curran, inter-State Rugby footballer, and Edgar
Bonnor. Edgar is a nephew of the mighty George
and himself a cricketer who may some day do things.
Bach of them would be smaller if there was not 6ft.
of him.

Maoriland lost a coming tennis champion
when Gordon D. Seay was killed in action lately,
after 14 months’ war service. Seay, before he wore long
trousers, had to be reckoned with by the old ’uns.
He won the premiership of South Canterbury, and
reached the semi-finals in the provincial fights at
his home-town, Christchurch. At that time in a
club championship he and William Goss, a wily old
bird at the game, took the Doubles Cup from Ollivier
and Jennings, then doubles champions of the
Dominion. A week or so later Goss and Seay did it
again, getting the Canterbury Doubles. Seay went
away as paymaster-sergeant, but chucked the job for
a chance to be in business as a gunner.
* * * *
A. S. Watt, who won the N. S. Wales
schoolboy singles tennis championship from Todd by
two sets to one, is a promising lad at this branch
of education. Although only 16, he has won Sydney
High School tennis championship for two years, and
looks an aspirant for bigger things in days ahead.
Among; the lasses, D. Akhurst (Normanhurst College)
had little difficulty in outplaying opponents and
retaining the title. There’s not a more consistent
player in school tennis.

“Jim Carew” : Where did “Con Drew” (B.
6/6/’18) learn Murrumbidgee pool? I have been “on
the road” in Australia for the past 25 years, and I
have never met a man who could “brown” a school
for any length of time. I am pretty familiar with
“Con’s” so-called “deadly contrivances” (except the
hold-back Peter, which I have never been up against)
and have found them to be mostly legends. Murrum
is usually played with the ordinary pool “shake” and
marbles, and the average man running a school is
satisfied with the profit he gets from the table with-
out taking the risk of cruelling his pitch by dirty
work.

“Wart” : Trout fishing has gone well this
season in Tassy. Lake Leake has given 2277 rain-
bows ; average weight, 3flb. ; largest fish on the fly,
7ilb. ; ditto, spinner, 81b. The Great Lake for the
last few years has not been popular as a fishing
resort, but this year it nearly reached its old form:
1264 brown trout and 433 rainbow trout, besides
several salmon. The average weight was over 71b.
The largest brown trout was 161 b. and rainbows of
91b., 101 b., 111 b. and llflb. were taken. The last
is a record for the Speck.
THE SPORTSMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I have a natty suit of brown.
The waist is smartly girded.
Because of it about the town
I frequently am “worded.”
I gave two tenners for my gun.
I’ve hardy sporting habits.
Some chaps prefer to shoot the Hun.
But that’s not sport; it’s merely fun—
I’m out for rabbits!
With leather knickers to my knees,
A quite attractive stocking,
I prowl about the hills and lees
Where little birds are flocking.
I’m noted as a shot. A ball
I’d almost put a midge in.
For dirty war I have no call;
I much prefer to take a fall
Out of a pigeon.
I have the huntsman’s instinct still
That fired my rude forefather.
I dearly love to maim and kill,
And any day would rather
Go slaying wildlings in the trees,
With rifle or with arrows,
Than lie about in pampered ease.
But nothing that shoots back can please
My taste like sparrows!

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort and good
health artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten

D. J. Gilbert, who has been “offered” the
position of Controller of Repatriation, is a
journalist with one of the quickest ears in
the trade. He has had Sydney Telegraph
and Herald experience, and was to have
been editor of the World; and when that
orb failed to spin he was provided with Gov-
ernment jobs, mainly through the good
offices of J. 0. Watson. In connection with
these jobs he has wiiat seems to the Win-the-
War Government to be the great merit of not
being a returned soldier.
Now that squatter John H. S. Lydiard is
dead, diligent inquiry discovers only three
survivors of the tony Victorian police cadets
of the goldfields days and earlier—Reginald
Green, who joined September, 1852, and
retired on pension December, 1883; John
Sadleir, joined December, 1852, and pen-
sioned December, 1896; and E. W. Fosbery,
M.L.C., who joined in 1852 and crossed in
the first ’sixties to N. S. Wales to remodel
Ma’s Robert.
Before Victoria had Billy Hughes to
help her —as far back, indeed, as the ’forties
—she had built the Jane Cain, a 292-ton
barque, intended for the London trade. The
139-ton City of Melbourne, said to have been
the first screw steamer seen in Australian
waters, was also built on the Yarra. Half
a century more of Freetrade, and it is doubt-
ful whether we should have enough enter-
prise to grill our native bear before eating
him.
A list of 28 Japanese steamship cos.
shows the lowest dividend to be 6 p.c. Then
there is 9 p.c. (one company) ; 10 p.c.

There is money in the ship business
when strenuous folk, who are too busy to
even attend Judd’s meetings and hear him
orate about liberty, can slam a new ship
together in six weeks, and make it pay for
itself in six months. Unfortunately we
do the paying.
Westralian Chamber of Mines complains
bitterly about the lack of finality in the
findings of the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court. As it is open to either party to
apply to vary the award and for the Court
to make such variation retrospective behind
the date of the application, a cited employer
can never be certain what wages he may
have to pay even for work already finished
and (as he thinks) paid for, and cannot
estimate with accuracy the cost of future
operations. What the Chamber wants is
for the Court to follow the lead of the" State
tribunals and make awards for definite
periods. . Recent Federal awards in the
mining industry are also growled at, par-
ticularly those features relating to a reduc-
tion in hours and increased rates for over-
time and. Sunday work. Both are declared
to be unjustifiable and likely to close down
the majority of mines now working in the
West.
“Edo”Kalgoorlie industrial unions are
slowly and surely working: to close down
most Golden Mile properties. Ignoring the
fact, that wiiile the price of gold remains
stationary the cost of mining materia] has
soared, unions insist on more wages, shorter
hours and alleged improved conditions which
will mean more expenses to the cos. Lat-
terly there has been a small strike for wet-
ground pay, though there is no such thing as
a really wet spot on the Mile, and all ore is
so dry that it goes straight from the shaft to
the dry-crusher. Then, though there are
more official inspectors than ever, and work-
ers appoint their own men, when a fatality
happens all hands in that mine pull out for
24 hours as a protest against unsafe working
conditions.. Over two years ago a specialist
was appointed to look after underground
ventilation, with the result that in this re-
spect drives and stopes are as healthy almost
as the surface; yet, the other day, unions
determined to supply their inspectors with
thermometers to see if a row could be started
on the temperature question.
“Copabella”: We discovered a bush-lawyer
of advanced type the other day. He had a
dispute with a friend over money and, hav-
ing won that, was rubbing it in with an
“insulting words” charge, the “words” hav-
ing been used during the money argument.
His chief supporting witness described the
shrewdie’s modus. “He come up to us at
the corner,” said the witness, indicating
Shrewdie, “and said he’d had a row down the
street and wanted a witness. We never
seen him before, but we said ‘Righto’ and
went along of him. He went up to th’''ac-
cused and said ‘You called me a scab.
didn’cha ?’ Th’ accused never said nothing.
Shrewdie said again, loud: ‘You called me
a scab !’ Then th’ accused turned on
him and said. ‘Well, so y’are a scab.’
Then Shrewdie said to us, ‘That’ll do me,
mates,’ and. we went back to the corner!
No, y’.W’ship,” said the witness, “we never
seen him before. We never got nothing for
coming here.” The Bench scratched the bald
spot for a while, then it said that sort of
evidence was no good to it, and gave the
accused the verdict. But as an essay in cor-
roborative evidence it had its points.
Adela Pankhurst, lecturing in Australia,
used to chuckle over the fact that comic
papers in Germany and elsewhere presented
the English politicians as miserable pol-
troons, trembling at the thought of what
the valiant suffragettes might do if they
caught them in thp street. How she laughed !
And how clever she was thought to be by
her silly women-disciples for having helped
to make the forbearance of the British
authorities look weak and foolish! Well,
the suffragettes of yesteryear are welcome
to all the consolation they can get from the
revelation of what the German Ambassador
said to Admiral Hood when he was leaving
England on the outbreak of the war:—
The Kaiser asked me to ascertain whether Great
Britain would participate ‘if Germany declared war.
I replied that....the British were s o unmilitary that
they allowed suffragettes to intimidate them. I
have no doubt that my report influenced the Kaiser
to declare war.
So the Pankhursts can take credit for hav-
ing done their little bit to bring about the
great catastrophe.

Winter Warmth 8 Comfort
in the Office and Home.
You can’t keep a light heart beating in a cold body. A
cold office or a cold home is poor economy. A cold office
means discomfort, and discomfort makes for discontent
and inefficiency.
And what a difference cosiness and warmth make in the
home —shivers are certain death to amiability. If the
home is cold and cheerless, one wants to either “Get out”
or “Go to bed.” Then there’s the children —their health
and comfort demand warmth.

liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned

Juno: No ; but if gold is held against notes
it means that a foreign creditor can be paid to the
extent of the issue, whereas a nation which has
£100,000,000 of paper money and no gold or means
to buy gold would be bankrupt if it had to pay a
foreign creditor as little as a fiver. “Why not issue
notes against real value in the shape of foodstuffs?”
We don't mind —if you can suggest a means by
which the notes shall go out of circulation as the
foodstuffs disappear.... Maleesh: Yes, but the dock-
ing wasn’t to pay for dungarees, great coats and
boots thrown overboard. And, anyhow, because

This is my hymn of hate about the horrible Huns.
May our troops blow them to smithereens with their
guns;
May they chop them up in horrible slaughter ;
May they make them run, as fast as water
Down a hill, back to Berlin ;
May they make them recognise their sin
In starting this : awful war.
May they make them do penance evermore;
May they keep them awake all night
With noise of guns and because of right.
May Billjim swear at them like some Billjims can,
And show each one that he is not a man,
But a great big horrible beast.

very rarely make good verses.... Amicus: They
haven’t the simple child-note which would give
them interest.... Assistant Bill : Your n.c.o. is a
dreadful plagiarist.... Jack: Send a marked cheque
for a thousand to pay probable damages, and we’ll
consider it... .Jim D.: The magistrate was right. ...
J.R.: Not good enough... .M.A.: The rhymeless
chant doesn’t thrill us.. ..S.K.: “Winter Pain” not
quite. . ..E.G.B. (perhaps): Why did you write in
water instead of ink ?.... Rasmus: Not up.... School-
girl, etc.: Not good enough yet; but there was a
time in Shakspeare’s ' life when he wouldn’t have
made much of a job of “Hamlet.”... .C.C.: Poor
thing with a very small point. .. .L.S.D.: The verse
doesn’t carry it... .W.J.8.: Not enough there....
O.B.: A splendid tribute:—
Oh! How these Heroes gave their flesh and blood,
To fight for their country and their King
As if they were stirred like a great flood
They were sure they did the right thing.
Oh! These Women Heroes we’ll never forget
Their great deeds they gave in Honor
Nor may they never regret,
As their loved ones went outdoor.

The comparatively new Primary Indus-

has the good mission in life to encourage

one method is to increase the demand for

from the 13th inst. onwards.
Prom a Provost-Marshal’s office in Prance ;
“Karee” (B. 25/10/’l7), in dealing with the sub-
ject of French decorations, puts too high an appreci-
ation on the Medaille Militaire and the Lfegion
d’Honneur.
French Honors rank thus: (1) Legion d’Honneur;
(2) Medaille Militaire; (3) Croix de Guatfre; and
they are awarded as follows: —
Officers. —The Legion d’Honneur is given (a) for
25 years’ service in the army; (b) for conspicuous
gallantry in the field and, as a rule, when an officer
has five or six bars to his Croix de Guerre; (c) to
officers who have shown conspicuous bravery in the
field and have been disabled through war services.
It is also given to prominent citizens—a “titre civil”
—but carries no pension and has not the same value.
Exceptionally it is given to n.c.o.’s and men for
specially gallant services, and is at least equivalent
to two Medailles Militaire.
N.C.O.’s and men.—The Medaille Militaire is given
for (a) 25 years’ service in the army; (b) conspicu-
ous gallantry in the field and, as a rule, when the
recipient has five bars to his Croix de Guerre. It
is never given to civilians. Exceptionally it is
given to General Officers who have commanded
armies in the field and who have already been given
the highest order of the LSgion d’Honneur.
Officers, N.C.O.’S and men.—The Croix de Guerre
is given for gallantry in the field.
The corresponding values of French and British
decorations are, approximately.-—For officers: Legion
d’Honneur (C.M.G., D. 5.0.) ; Croix de Guerre (M.C.).
For n.c.o.’s and men: LSgion d’Honneur (Y.C.) ;
Medaille Militaire (D.C.M.) ; Croix de Guerre (M.M.).

While the use of trailers cancels the guaranty on many trucks,
Denby encourages them.
That’s because the wonderful pulling power of the Denby motor,
and the sturdy efficiency 'of the Denby internal-gear rear axle,
enable Denby trucks to haul trailers without the slightest danger of
damage to the truck itself.
And there are many lines of business —perhaps yours is among them
•—where trailers will cut the delivery investment in two.

A Time for Strong Nerves
War-time, with its excitement and hysteria,
is a trial to the strongest nerves. To those
whose nervous systems are run down by
overwork or worry, to those who. are on the
verge of neurasthenia, it is a time of danger.
There is no tonic for the nerves that is not
a tonic for every other part of the body.
There is no form of debility that does not rob
the nerves of nourishment. The remedy,
therefore, for nervous breakdown, is a tonic
that will build up the general health, revital-
ise the blood and enable it to carry to the
nerves the elements that they need-
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are an ideal tonic
for this condition because they are non-
alcoholic, and neurasthenic patients should
avoid alcoholic stimulants.
Sufferers from nervous disorders who have
been taking treatment without benefit should
investigate the tonic method. Write to-day to
the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co.. Box 594

the Nervous System.” It will be sent free on

“E.T.”; Alfred Butt, new’est theatrical
knight, is connected with about a dozen
variety and legitimate playhouses in London
and the large provincial centres —-quite a
Xorthcliffe of the amusement world, in fact.
As a youth he was a “pushing young
particle” in Harrod’s Stores. Marrying a
daughter of one of the directors of the
Palace —the big vaudeville house in Shaftes-
bury Avenue —he drifted into the show busi-
ness. Lately in his spare time he has been
assisting the food-controller. He is still
acquiring theatres, and at present is the only
rival of Oswald Stoll, who, by the way.
could also have had a knighthood if he had
eared to put up the money.
“Old Yarra-banker” : Melba will be pleased
with the American papers when she gets back
home. New’ York Evening World made
her chatter like this:—
There is now no opera, because ,there are no great
voices, no great singers. There were l'our of us:
Nprdica, Calve, Earnes and I. Where can you find
their equals among- the voices of to-day?....1 kriow
that I have the most beautiful voice in the world,
and as long as I know that I shall keep on singing.
To smooth things over somebody told her
that the whole art and practice of Ameridan
interviewing is the translation of unspoken
thoughts; and somehow that didn’t seem to
mend matters much.
Hugh Buckler, who has been at various
times reported “incapacitated,” “missing”
and “dead,” has bobbed up alive and fit
enough to accept a mumming job in London.
When the last mail left he was playing a
“De Luxe Annie,” at
Sydney Palace.

respectively.
“Smike” : Guy
Post’s stage man-
ager, Milano Til-
den, has a great
opinion of the stage
staff at Melbourne
King's, who have
obliterated the Noo
Yark records for
changing the scen-
ery in “The Mas-
querader.” As the
two principal scenes
in the play are
fixed sets on mov-
able platforms, the
main thing required
is muscle and activ-
ity. John Chilcote’s
heavily - furnished
library can be sub-
stituted for Loder’s
lodgings in 33 sec-
onds ; I have seen
it done, with my
eye on the clock.
The achievement
was due solely to
the enthusiasm of
perfect ly-drilled
Australians. Incidentally, Tilden never spares
bouquets for that charming piece of pre-
cocity, Cecil Haines, who plays Peggy in
the drama. The infant, a young Australian
of 12, originally sparkled in Beau. Smith’s
“Seven Little Australians.”
“J.F.H.”: Compulsory curtain-fall at
10.30 at all London theatres and music-halls
started on Easter Monday. It is a war-
economy measure designed to cut down the
consumption of gas, coal and 'electricity. To
meet the requirements of the order .most of
the revues were pruned, overtures and inci-
dental music were cut down, and intervals
abbreviated. They are now practically con-
tinuous show’s extending over a couple of
hours. Oscar Asche starts his “Chu Chin
Chow” at 7.30 instead of 8, winding up at
10.15, and Marie Lohr has done the same
with her “Love in a Cottage,” which is
doing splendid business.
“G.H.”: The “something” which “went
wrong with the mechanism” of the gun that
fired a bullet into Chung Ling Soo was
explained at the inquest. The tube of the
gun used for carrying the ramrod had been
converted into a second barrel, and the
breech plug had been stopped up at one end
and drilled in the side to fire a charge in the
tube, leaving the live charge in the barrel
undischarged. Years of wear had rendered
the faked mechanism leaky, and the deto-
nator fired both charges.
C. J. Dennis attempted to pot “The Senti-
mental Bloke” for the movies, but didn’t like
the job, so it was turned over to Lottie Lyell,
who prepared “The Woman Suffers” for the
Southern Cross Films. Den gets £959 for
the picture rights of his classic, and also
earns the privilege of having his features in
the prologue. He will probably be shown
chained to his desk in a poetic frenzy, with
Hal Gye shovelling his royalties into a sack,
while Dave Low tries to calm them both
with a bit of ragtime or a song by Lauder.
Anyhow, “The Bloke” will shortly be on the
screen, along with Den’s Wellington nose.
THE MONOPOLISTS.
RUPERT: “Bah! Curse the war; the soldiers
are getting all the limelight!”
“T. 0.1.”: The Salle de Valentino, men-
tioned recently in The Bulletin and
known in old Melbourne as “The Sally,” was
amongst the earliest places of amusement
founded after the discovery of gold. It resem-
bled a small circus, circular in form, with
wooden supports and a wooden roof, standing
on a block of land at the eastern extremity of
Bourke-street w’here afterwards “Mint
Sauce” Jones had his tailor’s shop and
Charles Edouin had the Imperial Hotel. The
Sally’s entertainments comprised a prome-
nade concert and a ball. Here the lucky
diggers down for a blow-out met partners.
Still, in spite of its rorty character, Sara
Flower and many another leading vocalist
sang there. Not far off in Spring-street W’as
Astley’s Amphitheatre, built for G. B. W.
Lewis (whose widow is still acting in
London), the frailest and most combustible
of the old theatres in Melbourne, yet of them
all the only one except the Queen’s and the
Prince of Wales’s to escape destruction by
fire. The Queen’s and The Prince of Wales’s
were soon turned to commercial purposes,
which may account for their escape. A pic-
ture of the Salle He Valentino is in the
Mitchell Library.
“B.”: “Salome,” the play, w r as written by
Oscar Wilde in French, in 1893, and was
rehearsed by Sarah Bernhardt at the Palace
(then the English Opera House), London.
When the Censor banned the piece Wilde w r as
indignant, and declared that he would become
a naturalised Frenchman and live in Paris.
“The Vision of Salome” was produced by
Maud Allan in 1908 through the “J. T. Grein
Independent Theatre,” which was no particu-
lar theatre, and was run allegedly for Art’s
sake. Grein, a naturalised Englishman of
Dutch birth, and the man who went after
Pemberton Billing’s scalp and got something
else, is, or was, a well-known dramatic critic.
“Salome” was produced in the original in
Paris by Sara Bernhardt in 1894, the year
after the English censor had cast it out.
“Jean Sibi”: There must be something
defective in the moral temper of the English
when Wilde’s “Salome” should be considered
“perverted” at this time of day. The most
diligent searcher
for sexual unpleas-
antness will dis-
cover nothing in
the French original
or Lord Alfred
Douglas’s English
translation that en-
titles him to hold
his nose. The piece
is a picturesque ren-
dering of the Bible
tale, doubtless
limited in intention
by the author’s
comparative igno-
rance of French,
but never suggest-
ing that it had the
same literary birtjj
as the tainted
“Dorian Grey.”
Tw’o well - known
French authors,
Marcel S ell wob
and Stuart Merrill,
who were asked to
revise the French
of “Salome,” con-
fessed that the
play’s innocence
was sustained by
an artless vocabu-
lary, and this senti-
ment is supported
“The Easiest Way," at
Sydney Criterion.
Norma Mitchell as
Elfie St. Clair.
by the unanimous and unequivocal accept-
ance of the effort in almost every Euro-
pean country. As a matter of fact, “Salome’
is not so disturbing to Puritan sensibilities
as Flaubert’s jewelled description of the
scene, and hasn’t an atom of the relentless
realism with which Stidermann depicted the
heroine in “John the Baptist.”
“J.F.IJ.” from London :
On Easter Eve Australians in London were,, con-
fronted with a divided duty through the simultaneous
production of, a couple of new war plays, the lead-
ing lady in each case being an old favorite with
Sydney and Melbourne theatre-goers. However,
neither Ethel Irving at the Royalty nor Madge
Titheradge at the Garrick had any cause to complain
of lack of Australian patronage arid enthusiasm.
Ethel Irving scored a decided' success in a strongly-
emotional role designed for her by Hall Caine. The
piece is called “The Prime Minister,” and is based
on the assumption that another tremendous war is
to follow. It starts with the rising of the curtain
and finds Ethel —a furious German who recites the
Hymn of Hate with vitriolic energy and demoniac
scorn —employed as nursery governess in the house-
hold of the British Prime Minister. Germany decides
on his assassination, and the governess is naturally
commandeered for the job. But her feelings com-
pletely change, and in the end she gives her life to
save the statesman’s. It is a steep and uncon-
vincing story, and has had a mixed reception from
the critics; but it is generally agreed that Ethel
made the most of her difficult and luridly-contrasted
roles. Meanwhile Madge Titheradge was playing
naturally at the Garrick, and looking very charming
in the uniform of a lady-doctor in the French fighting
zone. Her piece is “By Pigeon Post,” and its author.
Austin Page, has turned out a crowded mixture of
French traitor, German spy, secret military plans,
wireless messages, and messages carried by pigeons—-
'plots within plots and wheels within wheels, so
much so that William Archer opens with the confes-
sion that if a prize of £lOOO were offered for an
accurate and comprehensible account of the proceed-
ings he would not compete. But he adds that “Miss
Madge Titheradge plays the medical heroine with
sprightly, vivacity and feeling.”
Another Australian play, “Billy from the
Rluegums,” which had a trial at Toowoomba
(Q.) recently, is the work of Miss Jane King
and Frank E. Shephard, both native-born.
The comedy-drama opens in a bush, shanty at
the Back o’ Beyond and ends in a Sydney
drawing-room where the Smart Set yawns
over life and plans the indiscretions which
make it bearable. At Toowoomba, where
a £5O house is fair biz, the players drew £3OO
in three nights.
“Snell”: Do actors and actresses become
more perfunctory, or am I merely quicker to
resent evidences of languor and boredom in
a performance? In any case, I am per-
manently off the last nights of long runs.
The price is no less on these occasions,
and the persons who pay to see and hear are
just as deserving of respectful consideration
and a fair return for their good money as
those who bought in earlier in the season ;
but what they get in nine cases out of 10 is
a distressing, remorseful feeling that they are
keeping the actors awake and robbing the
orchestra of its well-earned rest. On two
recent occasions the_ performances (in the
presence of fair audiences) w r ere so yawny
and slipshod that many present must have
felt, as I did, that they were doing a great
wrong in needlessly prolonging the existence
of a show that only wanted to be comfort-
ably dead and in full enjoyment of a quiet
burial.
From London :—•
“The 13th Chair,” immensely successful, is going
on tour. Madge Mclntosh, the old Australian favor-
ite, takes Mrs. Pat Campbell’s leading part. The
first anniversary of “General Post” has been cel-
ebrated in a practical way. There were two per-
formances, all the proceeds of the afternoon were
given to a war charity, and between the two the
author invited the company to dinner. This ; play
locks like running on indefinitely. But the most
astonishing success is “A Little Bit of Fluff,” aged
nearly 1200 and still going strong.
“Yatep”: The old nigger farce dies Imfd.
There are only tw’o “speaking” shows at
present in Brisbane—-vaudeville and bellow-
drama. The formerv introduces “A Ghost in
the Pawnshop” to an alleged modern revue,
and the latter rollicks through “Patsy Bol-
ivar” deftly sandwiched into Act 2 of Bret
Harte’s “Roaring Camp.” I remember these
absurdities as played by big Ben Brown,
little Newlands and Frank Hussey over 40
years ago, and recall my dad remarking that
they took his memory back to boyhood. Dad
is now abreast of his 90th mile-post.
Maeterlinck has produced a sequel to “The
Blue Bird” ; the children are grown up and
in love. A translation is to be tried in
London shortly. Sequels are notoriously
liable to be unequal to the originals, and
this Bird looks a particularly difficult thing
to add a wing ‘to.
When the gradual mail left, Dublin was
flocking to the Abbey Theatre to see “The
Lost Leader,” whose name is Parnell. He
is represented as having been in hiding and
turning up to take a hand in the 1916 rebel-
lion. <
“Stargazer”: George Riguold had been
appearing for a week at Bendigo in a most
affecting drama, in which he had depicted
the manly hero, a Cornish miner, with such
fidelity that the miners of Quartopolis were
profoundly touched, and the men of one big
mine, mostly Cousin Jacks, clubbed together
and bought an elaborate umbrella to present
to the splendid fellow. A deputation of
three called upon Rignold at the Shamrock,
while a barful of diggers awaited their re-
turn downstairs. Rignold was so amazed
at the brevity of the interview that he stole
down after them. The foremost Cornish-
man faced his brothers in the bar. flung the
umbrella on the counter before them, and
said: “We dedn’t give it to ’e.” Then, with
infinite disgust: “We’ve bin deceived in this
’ere Regnol’. Mail, ’e edn’ no Cornishman
an’ no miner. He’m a poor flitterin’ dude,
tha’s what ’e be.”
SIGN MANUAL OF SIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The villain in the picture-play
Is marked as with a bar;
Not only in the greedy way
He munches his cigar;
Not merely by liis awful scowl,
Nor by the way he’ll peep and prowl,
But sin is -in his soul agog,
If, when he enters, like a Hog
He kicks the dog.
From that fell act there’s no escape.
He may do fearful things—-
Manslaughter, robbery and rape—
And hope' still round him clings;
But down to deepest depths he’ll skate,
And end in universal hate—
Him will the splendid hero flog—
If in the pro(or epi Jlogue
He kick a dog!

Experts Writing for the English Press.
Simple and Effective Methods.
By Olga Amsdell, Special Correspondent,
London, Eng.
To Kill Roots of Superfluous Hair.
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but how
to kill the hair roots permanently. For this
purpose pure powdered phemiuol may be
applied- directly to the objectionable hair-
growth. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to instantly remove the
hair, but to actually kill the l’bots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol, obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
Removing Her Skin.
The quickest and surest way to make a
good complexion out of a bad one is to
actually remove the thin veil of faded or dis-
colored outer, skin from the face. This can
be done easily, safely and privately by any
woman. The process is one of gentle absorp-
tion.
Get some pure mereolised wax from your
chemist and apply it at night like cold cream,
washing it tiff in the morning. In a few
days the mercolide in the wax will have
absorbed the disfiguring cuticle, revealing
the fresh young skin underneath; you will
have a beautiful, clear, natural complexion.
The process is pleasant and harmless, making
the face look brilliantly attractive and youth-
ful. It also effectually removes such blem-
ishes as freckles, tan, moth patches, liver
spots, pimples, etc. Every woman should
keep a little mereolised wax on hand, as this
simple, old-fashioned remedy is the best com-
plexioned beautifier and preserver known.
Blackheads Instantly Go.
A very simple, harmless and pleasant pro-
cess is now used to remove blackheads and
correct .greasiness and large pores in the
skin. You have only to drop a tablet of
stymol, obtained from the chemist, into a
glass of hot water and bathe the face with
the liquid after the effervescence has sub-
sided. The blackheads will then come right
off rm the towel. The enlarged pores immedi-
ately contract to normal and the greasiness
disappears, leaving the skin smooth, soft and
cool and free from blemish. But to make sure
that this desirable result is permanent it is
advisable to repeat the treatment several
times at intervals of say about four or five
days.
Grey Hair Unnecessary.
One need not resort to the very question-
able expedient of hair dye in order not to
have grey hair. The grey hair can easily be
changed back to a natural color in a few
days’ time merely by the application of a
simple, old-fashioned and perfectly harmless
home-made lotion. Procure from your chem-
ist two ounces of tammalite concentrate and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply
this to the hair a few times with a small
sponge, and you will soon have the pleasure
of seeing your grey hair gradually darkening
to the. desired shade. The lotion is pleasant,
not sticky or greasy, and does riot injure the
hair in any way.
Naturally Wavy Hair.
Good stallax not only makes the best possi-
ble shampoo, but has the peculiar property of
leaving the hair with a pronounced natural
**wave, an effect presumably desired by many
ladies. A teaspoonful of the stallax granules,
dissolved in a cup of hot water, is ample for
a luxurious head wash, and leaves the hair
with a peculiar lustre and fluffiness obtainable
from nothing else as far as known. It is per-
fectly harmless, and can be obtained from
most chemists, although since it has been but
little used for this purpose it comes only in
jib. sealed original packages, enough to inake
up 25 or 30 individual shampoos. [2

THE WIDOW’S WOE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We wed when we were young and fine,
But soon dull life took hold of both,
And dust filled all this heart of mine—-
To laughter I was ever loath.
Not early, but with drift of days,
It came about, nor with intent,
That I must counter all his ways,
Go other than the way he went.
It vaguely seemed that this should be:
Because we were tied limb to limb
He must go daily hating me,
And I must go on hating him.
He need but do some simple thing,
, Or speak some wish, and sourly I
Would to another purpose cling,
His custom or his taste defy.
His hatings I must love, because
Thej' were his bane. What loved he would
I must detest. These were the laws
Of W'edlock as w’e understood.
And now he’s gone I sit by day
And mourn, deep in my heart a dread
That haunts my night. Has he his way?
Perchance he wished that hi was dead!

“The Oldest”: Of Parkcs’s first three
Ministries no one member remains. Of the
fourth (1887-9) Charles J. Roberts and
Francis Abigail are alive; of the fifth and
last, McMillan, Bruce Smith, Joe Carru-
thers, A. J. Gould and Pumpkin Smith.
N. S. Wales has had 24 lodgers at Govern-
ment House since the foundation of the State.
Five are living, the senior being Carrington,
1885-90. Of his successors four are dead
(Jersey, Duff, Hampden, Rawson) ; the
others alive are Beauchamp, Chelmsford,
Gerald Strickland and the present holder,
Davidson.
Former Govt. Astronomer Pietro Baracchi,
parent of recently-released Guido the
Irreconcilable, was himself an academic
Socialist in the mustard-seed days of the
movement in Melbourne. Guido’s grandpa
was a Tuscan soldier —a Knight of the
Crown of Italy and not at all nice to Aus-
trians.
“Bobby” Knopwood, Van Diemen's Land’s
first parson, could indulge in a sardonic sort
of humor when off duty. In his diary he
records how a sergeant of marines was given
100 lashes for drinking with a convict, and
then adds: “N.B.—This morning Lieut.-
Governor Collins breakfasted with Mrs.
Powers and Powers (a convict). Mrs. P.
lives always at the Governor’s table.” There
was nothing strait-laced about the best
society in the Speck in those days.
The family of Scotch parson P, J. Mur-
doch, of Melbourne, has been punching hard
for Australia. The war correspondence of
eldest son Keith has done more to keep Aus-
tralia in touch with her part of the war than
the work of any other pressman, and some
of his_ expositions of political and military
possibilities have been prophetic. He was,
by the way, the first Australian pressman
to interview a British Prime Minister. His
youngest brother, Lieutenant A. M., won the
Military Cross with a Victorian battalion
last year, and the performance has just been
duplicated by the middle brother, Lieut.
Ivon G. A sister is nursing at Caulfield
Military Hospital.
A very old Melbourne citizen, Tom Miller,
a one-time lawyer, sustained Malvern’s only
pack of beagles in the long ago. He kept
them at Iledgeley Dene, an estate overlook-
ing the Glen Iris Valley—now given up to
desirable villas and architects’ dreams. In
those years Iledgeley Dene was virgin bush
wherein the beagles sought bandicoots , and
native cats. The local aristocracy used to
follow the beagles afoot; Miller, too stiff for
such activities even in those distant days,
came along on his faithful hack. He used
to dismount at the fences, the nag would
hop over and Miller would then remount
and continue the pursuit. . It was a healthy
pastime for all parties except the bandicoot,
which is partly why Miller survives to tell
the tale, no doubt.
“Sol M.”: “Teller” complains re the
crumpled, soiled and allegedly germ-infested
condition of our note-issue. * I would ask
him to have patience, and not blame the
Government in his haste. Notes wouldn’t
be- crumpled if untidy people didn’t crush
them into balls, or bundle them confusedly
into. dirty pockets along with tobacco and
debris. The Government doesn’t crumple
the notes itself; if it did there would be a
Crumpling Board with a highly-paid officer
in charge and a big staff. And, anyhow, did
anybody ever see or hear a germ on a note?
Did anybody, according to evidence that is
good in a court of law, ever die of notes?
Has the death-rate gone up since notes prac-
tically superseded gold—or the birth-rate
either? And how does a ten-shilling note
compare for i closer settlement with an old
library book or a police-court Bible?
“Tliula’s” story of a strenuous family :
Ren Ruschpler, one of two Sydney boys who had a
thrilling- escape from a German prison at Peronne,
comes of a family expert at giving the slip. His
great-grandfather would have been shot as a Polish
rebel if he hadn't bluffed his guards. Ren’s father
decided when a youth to try Australia. While in
Sydney he accepted an invitation from the captain
of the German warship Aridine to dine on board.
After being fed he was detained on the vessel for
training. For two years he kept.the, stopper on a
volcanic temper ; but he lost control one day when,
as the ship lay at anchor off the coast of Maoriland,
an officer emphasised some remarks with a kick. The
subsequent swift proceedings landed him in the ship’s
prison. As he lay awake that night awaiting his
punishment at dawn, the door opened and his mate’s
head appeared. A minute later the two lads took a
dive over the side. The splash was heard and
bullets began .to whiz. Three hours later, at Island
Bay, Wellington, Ruschpler struggled ashore —alone.
•He made for the bush, where his fine physique won
the admiration of the Maoris and he so delighted them
with nauffbal instruments he improvised out of reeds,
etc., that they decided to keep him. Eventu-
ally he bolted, reached Palmerston North, and re-
turned to Australia. In Melbourne he married a
niece of Mrs. J. S. Butters, the lady who, as Mayoress
of that city in 1866, wore the historic dress repre-
senting “The Press.”


StOPAIN
A BOON TO MOTHERS.
After much thought and experiment
we have at last succeeded in completing
what we believe is the most successful
treatment known for toothache. We
have placed it on the market under the
name of
STOPAIN
A Toothache Gum.
Besides being the latest and most
successful treatment for toothache,
Stopain is both simple and economical.
It is in the form of a gum l and all you
have to do is to fill the cavity of the
tooth with it. It excludes the air and
stops toothache immediately.
No more burnt gums or blistered
tongues by liquid “cures” and this
alone means a lot to mothers.
Not only does Stopain relieve the pain,
but it also assists to preserve the tooth
until dental aid can be obtained, thus
making it invaluable to families in the
country who are often a day’s journey
from the nearest dentist.
Stopain is a boon to mothers. No
home should be without Stopain ; it is so
convenient and never fails to bring relief.
Stopain has been tried by thousands of
people and we have never yet known it
to fail when used according to directions.
Get it now for you never know when it
may be needed.
Stopain is sold by most retailers at Is.

Jjßanny Chamberlain
Whooping Cough’s
Strangling Grip
Often Permanently Injures.
THE danger lies in that awful straining cough,
which so often leaves permanent after effects.
The severity of the attack depends on your treat-
ment of it. Keep up the child’s strength with nourishing
food and at every paroxysm of coughing give
BS
m
This wonderful medicine
loosens the cough and makes it
easy to expel the toug*h mucus,
which is the cause of the strang -
ling sensation.
If the cough is kept loose and
expectoratio easy you need have
no fear of the after effects of
whooping cough.
Thed isease is contagious and
if one child is attacked the others
are bound to get it too.
Don’t wait till they develop the
cough. Start treating the others
as soon as the first is attacked.
Give them Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy in regular doses.
This will keep their lungs and
bronchial tubes free from that

Neglect whooping cough and
the attack may last eight or nine
months. Treated with Cham-

only run its usual course of sis
or seven weeks.

BE PREPARED.
tnany other dangerous maladies diarrhoea often comes on unexpectedly and frequently
the patient is aware of it some serious disorder Ins developed. During the warm
weather attacks of this kind are very frequent and often so swift in their results that life is in danger before the physician
can be summoned.
Those who have the interests of their family at heart keep a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy on
hand for immediate use in cases of this kind. It is without ciouht the best medicine prepared for diarrhoea, dysentery.and
other disorders of the bowels. If given at the first unusual looseness of the bowels the attack may be avoided but even in
advanced stages it is a quick and most effective remedy.
Never leave home without a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy in your luggage. The excitement
incidental to travelling and change of water and food often bring on diarrhoea, colic and pains in the stomach for which
speedy relief must be obtained and Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy can always be relied upon to do this.

Weakness
Every movement of the
body uses up a definite
amount of vitality. That
is why you feel tired at
the end of the day. When
you overtax yourself, or
when your vitality is
undermined by illness,
your whole system be-
comes too exhausted to
recover its lost vitality
without assistance. Your
system is like a plant that
is drooping for want of
water. And just as water
revives a drooping plant—
so ‘Wincarnis’ gives new
life and new vitality to a
weakened constitution.
Because ‘Wincarnis’ pos-
sesses a four-fold power.
It is a Tonic, a Restora-
tive, a Blood-maker and
a nerve Food—all in one.
Therefore <

The Wine of Life
creates new strength, new

can feel it doing you
good. You can feel every
wineglassful giving you
more strength than you
had before, and surcharg-
ing your whole system
with new vitality. That
is why over 10,000 Doctors

If you decide to go to the dogs, go to the

“Musketoon”: Put this to the Professor of
Spooks. On April 5 an old clock owned by
Mr. Harry New, of Warren(N.S.W.), which
had been long stopped, woke up and struck
12 (midnight). A few days ago Mr. New
received word that his grandson, Private
Mat Clark, was reported missing on April 5.
A syndicate which took on the job of boil-
ing down the blubber of 25 whales washed
ashore at Bayley’s Reserve (M.L.) struck
a gilded proposition. So far 1500 gallons
of oil have been extracted, and ambergris
valued at £3OOO is on hand. The next school
of whales to get high and dry will be wel-
comed with a banquet and three cheers.
“Sid”: “Smoko” (B. 2/5/T8) advises us
to go in for tobacco-growing. Now if he
will only tell us where to sell the stuff, he
and most other Aussies will soon have their
pipes full of local weed. Here’s my experi-
ence. I grew a patch of Havana cigar leaf
and sent a sample to the Vic. Government
expert, who reported: “The cigar leaf is a
nice sample, though on the small side, while
texture and color are good.” But manufac-
turers ignored my letters and samples, and
one that I interviewed might have been a
rabbit-skin dealer for all the interest he
seemed to take in my leaf. Give us a ready
sale and a fair price, and the tobacco will
be there.
A jewel-thief made a grab and a dash in
Sydney lately and got away with the best
part of a trayful of rings. This sort of
thing happens pretty often, but no jeweller
has yet ventured to break one of the old
traditions of the business and snip a chain
on to the tray as he pulls it out for the
customer. A polite system of espionage
seems to be about the only protection the
best shops have, though the ornamental per-
sonage who patrols the kerb in front and
fusses about motors may be an armed sprin-
ter in disguise. The bookseller, with cheap
bulky stock scattered around, can afford to
put up ‘a bluff that all buyers are honest;
the jeweller grown flat-footed with waiting
and hollow-chested with, bowing has to watch
his customer for sleight-of-hand, and if
there’s a breakaway he’s in no condition to
leap his own counter.
“D.F.”: The first petition in favor of
price-fixing in Australia came from the
“settlers of the Field of Mars.” On Feb. 19,
1798, they met and asked Governor Hunter
to fix the retail price of imported commodi-
ties. Thev complained that the wholesaler
sold tobacco at ss. while the retail price was
10s. or 155., that sugar was landed' at from
7d. to 13d. and cost them anything from
2s. 6d. to 55., and that tea had jumped from
10s. to 40s. The hardest knock of all was
that spirits bought wholesale at from os. to
10s. a gallon were traded off at 15s. a bottle.
After telling Hunter that Heaven had sent
him as “the angel of our deliverance” the
petitioners said: “As the Colony is now over-
run with dealers, pedlars and extortioners it
is absolutely necessary to extirpate them.”
Two or three of the breed seem to have been
left, however.
“E.S.S.”: The American green bug, at
present attacking the orange crops, and the
Indian white wax scale, which seems to
fasten on to anything, even the native trees
in the bush, are two particularly obnoxious
curses that Australia has been saddled with
through the importation of fruit. They are
costing the orchardists a mint of money to
fight, and the ultimate cost to the country
is incalculable. Fruit importations cannot,
by any stretch of imagination, be con-
sidered" necessary, yet the Federal Govern-
ment has quite recently permitted large ship-
ments to be brought in, and that despite a
distressing need of shipping space for other
purposes. Another thing that should be
seriously considered is the probability of these
fruits being carriers of new ills to con-
sumers. A Broken Hill doctor not long ago
advanced the theory that the mysterious X
disease was caused bv eating unwashed
grapes. If he had blamed foreign-grown
fruits he might have been much nearer the
mark.
“Cicada”: Here’s a coincidence. At a
recent conference of Censors and Editois in
Melbourne, the name and fame of Brig.-
General Gellibrand, D.S.Q, and Bar, were
the subject of passing reference. Gellibrand
is the Tasmanian orchardist who was a
lieut.-colonel in Gallipoli, where he won the
D.S.O. Later he had command of a brigade
when it went forward to recover the ground
lost at Bulleeourt. Another brigade had
failed of its objective, a British division had
been hung up. and Gellibrand’s was attacked
on both flanks. Before he had saved the day
the brigadier was carrying a rifle himself.
The Bar was the first of his rewards for the
remarkable performance. Well, one of the
editors, who had been at some pains to
emphasise Gellibrand’s identity, entered a
tobacconist’s shop after he left the conference
and called for a packet of cigarettes. He
opened it —and the card inside bore Gelli-
brand’s photograph!
“Warrego Bill”: While “Copy Boy” and
others are arguing about southern Premiers,
let me put forward T. J. Ryan as the most
courteous and approachable Premier that
Bananaland has ever had. Immediately he
assumed office, Ryan won the hearts of the
pressmen by fixing a time, morning and
afternoon, at which to submit to their cross-
questioning. and throughout his term he has
adhered to the arrangement. He was quite
a relief after the testy Denham. Kidston
was also an easily approachable man, but he
was not so popular with pressmen as Ryan,
who frequently excuses himself from import-
ant callers in order that he may go out into
the hall and submit to the questioning of the
roundsmen, and thus keep to his appoint-
ment with them. By comparison Hughes is
a rude and abusive little bounder. My
first experience with him was during the
Wide Bay campaign in 1915, shortly after
he had become Prime Minister. I received
a telegram from the Age instructing me to
ask him if it were true that the Labor mem-
bers had presented a memorial asking that
Parliament be re-assembled early in the New
Year. Billy raged up and down the room
and shouted: “It has nothing whatever to do
with you, or anybody else ! You might as well
ask me what I had for my damned break-
fast !”

A Challenge to the Elements

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Rainy Season.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE wind is harnessed to cloud again
I And it frets a little about the load
As it draws it on with an unseen rein
O’er the hidden leagues of the long blue
road;
For the high cloud waggons are heaped with
snow
Of the great white fleeces the mist-sheep
grow.
The wind is harnessed to cloud once more;
Perhaps some goddess has need to spin,
And she sits and chafes at her golden door,
JNor will take heart till she can begin;
So the sun-serfs go to each hazy pool
To help to gather the white cloud-wool.
And they cry the wind from the Arctic seas,
And the wind comes whinneying from the
North
To the following foals of the lesser breeze
That the grey South-East brought forth ;
irom the low fields sparkling with early
rain
They draw the waggons of cloud again.
And the pack takes many a different form
As the waggon moves on the long blue road,
hor the black sheep give it a hint of storm
And the lightning darts through the gleam-
ing load,
Till the restless goddess who fain would spin
Uan use a flash for a knitting-pin.
I hope she will knit it away to-night
And leave us only the empty blue,
So the rollicking wind can travel light
And play, with nothing at all to do—
With nothing to draw as it gently blows
Put the sunny soul of a happy rose.

The Grave of Pierre Lamont.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT lay beside tbe uneven mounds of red
bricks, with here and there a fragment
of wall still standing, in what had been
a gaiden but was how merely rough gi'ound
broken with shelMioles and cumbered with
debris. It bore a simple cross with an in-
scription that it was the resting place of
Pierre Lamont, died of wounds, September,
**••lk 9 cross was decorated, as usual,
with one of the tricolor cockades which mark
the graves of French soldiers. There are
many such graves; but this, isolated in the
wilderness of the deserted village, was con-
spicuous.
Not that the village was empty. Caval-
cades of horse- and motor-transports passed
through it daily, and its shattered streets
were tull of soldiers, from the neighboring
camps, or the billets improvised in the least
broken houses. In an estaminet, with
boarded window-places, its roof patched with
stnps ° 4 f corrugated-iron and tarpaulin, the
Y.M.C.A. served them with tea at 10 cen-
times a jam- or milk-tin, and assured its
customers that there were no more candles,
but some were expected to-morrow; while
upstairs, in the crowded writing-room, letters
tor home were being written by the hundred.
Ihe Hotel de Ville, buttressed with sand-
bags, held a canteen in one doorway, and
was disposed otherwise, as far as its reduced
condition would allow, in military offices. At
its front, where a fountain may have played
tormeriy, was a. water-tank with its notice
that the water must be boiled or chlorinated
and required an unmentioned quantity of
bleaching powder to 100 gallons; and there
were always some horses or mules at the
water-trough hard by.
And now the inhabitants were returning
to the village. Some of them came un-
noticed, like the man who hung the sign
Barber Done Here” outside his shop, and
who, apparently, had formerly been a
butcher ; like the little woman in black, with
two children looking much too young to be
anything but her grandchildren, whose pre-
sence was made known by the unexpected
opening of shutters which showed a window
with glass in it, and, behind, a few packets
of cigarettes and tobacco, some tinned goods
and an assortment of violent-hued gelatine
postcards. One egg, placed adroitly in the
centre of the confusion of other goods, gave
indication that fried eggs and coffee might
be obtained within—an assurance that was
received with enthusiasm, restrained some-
what until pay-day, when a packed doorway
testified to popular approval. The growing
congestion was relieved by the intimation
that another shop where fried eggs were cul-
tivated had burst into flower in another
quarter.
Some, however, came heralded. There
were strange carts bearing loads of furni-
ture, now and then with a coop of fowls
showing amongst them; and a handcart or
so, laboriously propelled over the muddy
roads. Sandbag embrasures and boarded
windows began to disappear, and glass, with
wonderful clean little window-curtains, and
plants in pots, to take their place. Unsightly
structures, erected for military exigencies,
vanished. The military were moving out to
new camps ahead. Children appeared in the
streets, splashing their wooden shoes in the
mud by the roadside. They were at home
again—with, the stray mongrels and the cats
that had arrived from nowhere to do or shirk
their duty regarding the rat nuisance.
It was the barber who noticed my interest
in the grave of Pierre Lamont. Something
in its solitariness, I suppose, appealed to me,
for I scarcely ever passed without pausing
to look at it and speculate.
“The people are returning; but it will be
more better when the war is over,” he said—
his usual preface to all remarks. “Old Pierre
Lamont he come to-day; but he went away
again, some more, I think.”
“Pierre Lamont?” I asked, momentarily
puzzled.
“I saw you look at the grave, M’sieur;
the grave of his son.”
I nodded understanding.
“So the old man has returned—to visit the
grave, I suppose? A sad visit!”
“But, yes ! More sad for him ! Old Pierre
was—what you call? —a miser. He and his
son were—were —not friends.”
Butcher that he was, he had the barber’s
trick of talking. He asked if the razor was
all right, M’sieur, and then, regarding it as
a courtesy question that made no real differ-
ence, went on talking.
“Young Pierre he was debonair; but old
Pierre—no! The father of the old man, he,
too, was of the money too fond; but with
him it was a fondness for making riches, and
when his son became old enough, he showed
him how to make the money also, and they
worked together. But with old Pierre it
became a madness. Of nothing else could
he think; no, not of the boy, even, who had
no mother, for Madame died. That was for
the boy good, perhaps. A little —what you
call? —wild lie became, perhaps, running
about with the holes in his clothes and
nobody caring; but he grew a k bon young
man, who spent a franc when he got it, and
had not the money-sickness; handsome and
brave and strong. With him I played when
a boy, though I was much more old; but no
shame have I in saying that we fought, and
it was not I that won, M’sieur. But, he
getting a franc, we spent it together, M’sieur.
“Old Pierre, he went on counting his
money, and young Pierre he went on being
happy. It is said that the old man spent
his time making schemes for more money, and
preparing his deeds of mortgage and reading
them again and again ; and, that being done,
he would count up his money for the love
of it. At least once in the day. he counted
it; at sometimes, more. And, because it
pleased him so much, he got the love of
having the money itself, besides the deeds,
just to count it, centime by centime.”
He shook the cloth from beneath my chin,
and indicated to me the hanging towel, that
I might rub over my face if I desired; but
went on talking as he lathered another cus-
tomer, and I lingered, listening.
“Young Pierre, he became 17, 18, 19.
Nobody know what will become of young
Pierre; least of all he know himself. Cer-
tainly sometimes he did wring money from
the old man, but not enough, and spent it;
but tiring of little money and poor clothes,
he took work —all sorts of work; on the
farms, in shops, and sometimes clerk —to
clothe himself and have the money to spend.
He did spend it free: what you call chuck
it about; drinking wine, and singing songs,
and making love. But, still, old Pierre he
seemed to not notice.
“Only when Pierre, as a young man will,
fell in love, did Pierre pere notice. It
was Marie Duboisin at the Bstaminet du
Nord that Pierre loved. She was petite and
good ; what you call bonsare. But no; old
Pierre meant not for Pierre to marry her.
For what of the dot? The Duboisins had
money very little, and old Pierre, who
thought of nothing but money, meant his son
to marry a dot. He stormed and he swore;
and that, of course, made Pierre love Marie
very much. So Peirre pere and Pierre fils
they quarrel; and Madame Duboisin she say
no daughter of hers will sweetheart with a
man whose father likes her not; and Pierre
says the devil! he will do as he likes, and
he likes Marie; and Marie she says she
will always love him; and old Pierre says to
his son, in a great fury, at last, that he
could go to the Devil. So he went to Paris.
But Marie he kiss before he go away.
“I saw him,” he added, with pride. “And
she weeping about him, too, and crying that
she loved him. That is all, M’sieur,” he
concluded abruptly.
To me it seemed but the beginning.
“But the grave?” I hinted.
“Oh —ah, the grave!” he cried, as if he
had found a new subject. “Young Pierre he
was buried there. The towel, m’sieur. Tup-
pence, please. Thank you very much,
please!”
This to his customer; but I lingered as he
tucked his cloth under the chin of a new
client.
“He came back to die, fighting, about
here?” I asked.
“But yes! The war he come—ah, that
was very bad. At first the people stay; but
not after the Uhlans came riding in, and go
away again; then more come, patrols only.
Then come our army—patrols too —only
afterwards the British ; and with them, when
they come, the shells commence to fall, fall,
fall, until the people run away. Only some
stayed, hoping it would pass; but no, and
then the whole of us that remained we went
also. Ah, but —to leave your home, M’sieur!
All you have!....And the sights, M’sieur!”
“How about Marie?” I inquired.
“Ah, she was of the lucky ones! Some
scandal was made because of Pierre, and,
therefore it was thought more better she
should go to a convent and become a nun.
So she was there, though not a nun—not yet.
And the people of the Estaminet du Nord
were all killed, and the house ruined. Ah.
there has been much people killed: it will
be more better when the war is over!”
“But how did Pierre” I began.
“Ah, yes! Pierre, M’sieur! It was that
I would tell you! Old Pierre did not go;
perhaps he knew that Pierre was with the
French army, and hoped, if he was near, he
would come home; for old Pierre had aged,
and he fretted sometimes about his son,
though nothing said. His home was shelled,
and caught fire, but he remained: we were
here between the armies, M’sieur. Then,
one night came a soldier, much wounded,
stealing through the village; and we who
knew him knew it was Pierre. Yet he had
no words for any, only ‘Where is my father?
Has he not gone? How dare you let him
stay?’ ”
He paused to steady himself.
“For he had come back, he whom his father
had disowned, in his fear for him. Brave,
M’sieur; for he risked much from his own
army, too, adventuring here; and he had
come with cost of sore wounds. Scarce
could he reach his father’s house; and-in the
morning was this grave that you know of,
M’sieur. And old Pierre that day went.
“He was as one mad; for when a German
patrol came in the town, he cursed at
them and threw money at them, cry-
ing: ‘Dirty dogs! That is all you want.’
Money that he so much loved! The Ger-
mans said it was not much money, but hear-
ing of his son and seeing the new grave,
they took some pity and left him; but they
came back at night, the dogs.

Require Prompt Dressing with ZAM-BUK
INSEPARABLE from the rough, tearing work of the work-
shop, railroad, farm or cattle station are those every-
day cuts and bruises which may be neglected once too
often. Zam-Buk has brought to the worker new possibilities
in “first aid.” Clean the skin round the wound or cut, and
promptly dress the injury with Zam-Buk. Zam-Buk does
more than allay pain and inflammation; it prevents fester-
ing and blood-poisoning, and heals up your hurt quickly and
perfectly. Zam-Buk is wholesome, and contains none of the
rancid animal fats that make old-fashioned ointments so
risky and useless. When you cut or scratch yourself the
best thing to do is to apply Zam-Buk, the powerful anti-
septic and healer.
GUT HIS HAND WHILE SAWING.
Painful, Inflamed, Festering Wound Healed.
“While sawing, my husband inflicted a nasty wound in
his left hand with the saw,” says Mrs. F. Reid, of Fleet
Street, Devonport, N.Z. “The wound inflamed and festered
up, and stubbornly refused to heal, notwithstanding the
various remedies and treatments we tried.
“At length we happened across Zam-Buk, and
were so encouraged with the marvellous benefits
derived from the first applications that we continued
to apply this excellent balm. Zam-Buk drew all the
bad matter out of the sore, allayed all inflammation,
finally healing up the place with clean, healthy skin.”
Every Worker Needs ZAM-BUK.
Zam-Buk is a perfect remedy for eczema, ringworm,
ulcers, bad leg, blood poisoning, scalp disease, running
sores, festering wounds, sore feet, piles, scalp disease, rash,
and quickly heals cuts, burns, scalds, sprains, bruises,
scratches, and similar skin injuries, Zam-Buk is sold by
all stores and chemists at 1/6 and 3/6 per pot.

“For the Germans knew, even when they
came, of old Pierre and his money. The
tirst patrols would stop, and bully him, try-
ing to make him yield them bribes for peace
and security; and later they would search
his house and demand his money openly. But
old Pierre was shrewd; he must have sent
it away; but even many of us thought he
had hidden it in his cellars. Did I not, my-
self, catch Peter Bascelle searching for it
with pick and hammer, hardly had old Pierre
left the village.”
“And the Germans caught you?” I sug-
gested, shrewdly.
“I did but think that, knowing the Ger-
mans would search, it would be a pity if old
Pierre had left it where a seeker could find,”
said the barber, unabashed. “Had I found
it and the old man wanted it—why, it was
his! But the Bodies ordered me away from
the town; yet not before I knew that they
could never find the money, for old Pierre
had beaten them. And there are now many
holes, besides those the shells have made.
It was Jean Nicolas who first returned, and
I know that his hurry was to search, too.”
Another man took the chair.
“Look here,” I commenced; but the bar-
ber. had commenced an entirely new conver-
sation with his latest patient. I went out.
It was late when I thought of returning to
camp. Passing what had been the residence
of old Pierre Lamont I came upon a unique
crowd grotesquely illuminated by a pair of
lanterns. An old man stood in the group,
and facing him were some excited figures
standing out from a background of soldiers,
late wanderers like myself, amongst whom I
recognised the barber. Between them was a
man in uniform.
“He has the permission of the town com-
mandant,” said the man in uniform, deci-
sively. The old man, ignoring the excited
people round him, opened what seemed like
.a box, and taking out a paper held it to the
flame of one of the lanterns. He dropped it
to the ground as it flared and poured more
papers upon it.
“Deeds!” he said, as though talking to
himself. “These people are beggared—why
should I make their burdens more? And
these—my country also will be poor.” More
papers went on the flames.
“Old Pierre purifying himself of his sins
by fire!” I said, also to myself.
“But.” vociferated the barber, “to violate
his son’s grave—his son, Pierre!”
“Yes, that is it!” cried several voices.
There was a grim silence. Then another
box was carried into the circle of light and
laid on the ground. The tall young figure
that had borne it straightened itself, and
advanced so that the light fell on a hand-
some face seared by a bullet wound.
“Pierre!”
Then Pierre explained.
“My father would not go till he had hid-
den his money. So I rejoined the troops,
sure that he would follow.”
We knew then what had been buried in
the grave.
“The grave was yours, Pierre,” said the

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PETER SMITH is working at night!”
So the gossip ran round the town-
ship. The elder gossips added in-
formation of the last time Peter was known
to work at night—2o years ago. Since then
he'had declined to use his forge after dark,
no matter how urgent the w r ork. He
would get up at daylight in the morning, but
no pay could persuade him to work after
te,
* * *
A hundred years ago, when the army
which had defeated Napoleon was begging
and starving about the English countryside,
Peter Smith’s great-grandfather signed an
agreement to go to Van Diemen’s Land
as smith to the Van Diemen’s Land Associa-
tion.
It was only the fear of being unable to
earn enough to keep his young wife and
child from feeling the pinch of hunger that
could have made him take such a step.
The forge of the Peter Smiths had been a
part of the Devonshire village since before the
dawn of written history. In fact, much of
the early history was hammered by the Peter
Smiths into iron, and is still sometimes dis-
covered —old weapons and armor buried
with long-forgotten chiefs, pirates and sea-
rovers in long-forgotten graves ; old weapons
and armor treasured in museums and manor
hall; massive iron hinges to the doors,
beautiful altar railings, and hooks and spikes
whose use have long been forgotten, in the
Avails of ancient churches; old iron furniture
and utensils in old farmhouses; and old
farming implements rusting in odd corners of
old farmyards. So the forge seemed a part
of the village and was always handed down
to the eldest son, Peter, along with the old
traditions and recipes for torturing iron into
beautiful and useful shapes. It seemed
almost as big a sacrilege to uproot it as it
Avould have been to uproot either of the old
oak-trees which shaded it, and seemed to
have stood there just about as long.
So Peter Smith’s great-grandfather found
himself at Cressy in Van Diemen’s Land,
where the company owned many acres of the
best land in the island, and he was restive.
Not that the company was a bad company
as land-owning companies go; it worked its
land as far as it could get labor to do so;
it bought the stud stock that laid the
foundation of Tasmania’s flocks and herds,
and its servants were treated well, although
always made to remember that they were
servants. But Peter had heard stories of the
land which was given away to almost any-
one who went to Hobart and asked for it;
even time-expired convicts were becoming
landowners. He decided to become a land-
owner, too.
He left his wife and children at Cressy,
and five days afterwards was in Hobart
inquiring about land. But word from the
manager of the company had preceded him,
and, although there was land for others,
there Avas none for Peter Smith’s great-
grandfather. It would never have done
for the idea to get about that such as he
could have land for the asking. Why, none
of the large landowners would have been able
to keep a servant at all, and that would
have been a nice state of affairs —for the
landowners! So Peter collected his forge
and his family and settled down at Ross.
It may be the stone houses, the English
trees, the hedges of gorse and hawthorn and
the rabbit he saw on the road had some-
thing to do with his choice. But mostly, I
think, it was that he saw the coaches and
the waggons on the main road, and knew
that wherever there is much traffic there is
need for a blacksmith. There he grew old and
handed over the forge and all the secrets of
the trade to Peter’s grandfather, who mar-
ried and begat a family and grew old in
his turn, and died after handing over the
business to Peter’s father. Peter’s father
married and might have grown old in his
turn, but he was kicked by an unruly horse
which he was shoeing, and the forge
descended to Peter before he was 20 years old.
Peter married the daughter of a neigh-
boring farmer. She was fair and slight as
Peter was big and dark, as a Peter Smith
should be. For twelve months they lived as
near to heaven as it is given to mortals on
this earth to do. She delighted to go in
the forge when he was working after tea and
blow the bellows for him. She never tired
of seeing Peter, standing in the midst of an
aureole of sparks, hammering the white-hot
iron, nor of seeing the muscles of Peter’s
arms and throat lit up by the red glow of
the forg’e, and moving like serpents under
the skin as he swung the hammer.
At the end of the twelve months young
Peter was born and the mother died. Peter
sat in the room with his dead for two days,
neither speaking nor taking any notice of
those who came and went. The old doctor
spoke of brain fever, unless Peter could be
turned from his grief; but nothing availed.
He followed stolidly to the grave and came
just as stolidly home. It is hard to say what
stirred him, but at night he went into the
smithy, lit the fire and began working at
some iron bars. Night after night he
worked, blowing his fire and torturing the
iron into strange shapes. Never a very
sociable person, he encouraged company less
than ever. At the end of two months he
brought out the result of his work, took it to
the cemetery and fitted it round the grave—
a little iron railing. More than an iron
railing, it was a work of art; Peter had
beaten his grief into the metal until it took
on strange and beautiful shapes. Then he
went home and asked for the boy, and for
twenty years refused to do any work in his
smithy at night.
Young Peter grew up. An assassin threw
a bomb at Servajo. A fortnight afterwards
the world was at war. For a week the war
made little difference in the lives of either
old or young Peter, and then the papers
began to tell of the German’s doing in Bel-
gium. One morning young Peter put down
the paper with the remark: “I suppose I’d
better go.” ‘‘lt seems so, lad,” said old
Peter; and young Peter went.
Peter went to see the boy at Claremont
camp and examined his kit with the eye of an
expert. Clever little things; but rather frail,
he thought, most of them—not the work
there should be in them. Now Peter was
home and working at night. He did not
encourage inquisitiveness in those who went
to see what he was doing. He had picked
out a fine piece of steel and was hammering
it and beating and hammering again, until
it took on the shape of a saucer, and then
of a basin. The blood of generations of for-
gotten armorers was strong in Peter, and he
was making a helmet. He had one of young
Peter’s hats, and he measured and gauged
and hammered his steel until it took on the
shape of a skull-cap with a slightly outward
curved edge. Then Peter polished and blued
it and lined it with felt.
On the day the transports left Hobart
Peter was there to see them go. At this last
farewell he handed young Peter the helmet,
saying that he had been particular to make
it so that it could be worn, almost invisible,
under the regulation hat or cap. Young
Peter put it in his knapsack and, although
it was heavy and he had little confidence in
its ability to stop a rifle bullet, he would
not have left it behind for any money. His
companions joked about it and said it would
make a good stewpan ; but Peter carried it
through all the long days of drilling in the
hot sand and sun of Egypt.
On the great day of landing he put it on
under his cap and before the day was out it
had two bright grooves where glancing bul-
lets had struck it.
Peter’s helmet was shown round the rem-
nant of the company, and when it got as
far as the Colonel he sat down and wrote
to the War Office about it.
Four weeks on Gallipoli and young Peter
was blown up by a high explosive shell from
“Beachy Bill” and the helmet, with a third
dent made by a shrapnel bullet, was packed
up with his other belongings to be sent home.
When Peter’s father was informed of
Peter’s death he seemed to crumple up
almost as badly as when Peter’s mother died.
For weeks he went about his work, hardly
speaking. He seemed to live only for the
letters which still came from Peter —posted
before his death. One day the parcel arrived
with Peter’s few belongings. In the helmet
was a letter from the company commander
telling of the way Peter died and saying that
he believed the account of Peter’s helmet had
gone a long way toward getting the War
Office to manufacture them for all. Peter
put the letter down, picked up the helmet,
wandered across to his wife’s grave in the
shadow of the ivy-covered church steeple.
There was no tombstone, merely Petjer’s
beautiful railing and the grave covered with
clean white sand. The only ornament was
a wreath of silver and white put there
by a good-natured brother-in-law; although
Peter vaguely had always thought it
looked out of place he had left it. To-day
he knelt down and took thrf! gaudy thing
from its glass-top tin case and put the
dented helmet in place of it. Then, after
laying the wreath on a neighboring grave
which was already well supplied with such
objects, Peter went home.
Next day he shaved himself clean and went
to look for the recruiting-sergeant.

“I have pleasure in stating that 1 have given both of the 2 Stand Portable
Crutching Plants I purchased from you an exhaustive trial, and with the
utmost satisfaction. They are handy to move about, economical to run, and
the Fairbanks Morse Engine is simplicity itself. Crutcliing at the different

considerable.”
