LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
PROUST AND PSEUDS
Sir,
N. W. McGuire (4/4/64) thinks that
no normal boy of sixteen would busy him-
self admiring Proust or Beethoven, but
vvould spend his leisure playing football
or cricket. Cultural pursuits are pre-
sumably effeminate (suitable for a girl,
tnd therefore unimportant).
Whatever may be said of Proust,
here is surely no doubt about Beetho-
vens masculinity? Moreover, what is
io normal about this priority for activi-
ies in which females have no part?
Vewcomers to Australia wonder about
t; for me the most mystifying aspect is
he mutual attractiveness that evidently
ixists among the beefy, boring, foot-
>alling drongoes that your correspondent
vould have as a desirable norm.

It was with some surprise that I read

Jjay ask, from what olympian height
'oes Mr McGuire presume to dub Paul
ohnson a “pseudo-intellectual”? Is not
his cliche becoming a device for
escribing people whose thought pro-
esses are a bit us, or from
vhom we differ extremely?

the guests' suites and the

our staff are dedicated to the

Our fully licensed restaurant
is already becoming a mecca

drew a word picture of Sir William as
a rugby player, “holding the ball and
punting upwards” —no mean feat.
As far as my criticism of trade with
Red China is concerned, it is not direct-
ed towards unilateral action by Austra-
lia, which would have little effect on the
political problems involved. The Chi-
coms are true Marxist-Leninists and
believe Lenin's dictum: “When the capi-
talist world trades with us they will begin
to finance their own destruction.”
Sir William Gunn on his return from
Peking said: “We were engaged in in-
ternational trade, not politics.” Chou
En-lai and Liu Shao-chih, Red China’s
two most powerful leaders, have said on
many occasions recently that they do not
recognise any difference between poli-
tics and economics. There is plenty of
evidence as to examples of how the
Communists have put this theory into
practice.
The first question is: “Do the Chicoms
need technical training in wool textiles?”
If Sir William had gone shopping in
Hong Kong on this trip, he would have
found he could have purchased first-class
woollen textiles made in Red China. It
they do not really want technical assist-
ance, what do they want? Would it be
textile machinery on long-term hire pur-
chase terms, which in effect is a short-
term loan? This is already operating on
wheat purchases (40 per cent of our
wheat sales) from Australia and Canada.
Why do the Chicoms need these terms,
when they are financing other countries
for subversive purposes, e.g. Somalia £2
million grant and £7,200,000 sterling
loan interest free for three years.
Why do non-Communist countries
want to finance the destruction of them-
selves and their friends, e.g. S.E. Asia?
This is the avowed objective of Peking,
reiterated almost daily by the Peking
Radio. Now that a new Communist
Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist) has
been formed and is receiving full en-
couragement and support from Peking,
are we in fact partially financing our owm
Communists who seek to overthrow our
democratic system by revolution, not
evolution?
In New Zealand, Indonesia, Japan,
Ceylon and Burma, the Communists are
all working with Peking not Moscow,
and so are North Vietnam, the Pathet
Lao in Laos and the Viet Cong in South
Vietnam.
Your Man on the Land stated that I
got “letters published occasionally”. I
trust this may be one of them and that
it may make some people give more
thought than they have up to the pre-
sent to the intricate and dangerous prob-
lems involved in trade with Peking. If
we want to finance textile mills, why not
assist our friends rather than our enemies,
especially when many of them, such as
Formosa, are contributing substantially
to our national security?

“THE GROUP” OUTDONE
Sir,
Add to “Batman's” browsings in
salacious literature now available on the
newstands of Australia’s capital cities
(4/4/64) the fact that certain novels by
authors of world repute are readily
obtainable in most libraries and book-
stores. These (including some of Yerby’s
and Slaughter's) make “The Group - ’,
“Chatterley”, “Lolita” and “Peyton
Place” read like text books.
My wife runs a “haute couture”
establishment. During the last five
years eight juniors have left hurriedly
through pregnancy. None of them were
acquainted with “Chatterley”, “Lolita’ - or
"'Peyton Place”, their main reading being
the women's weeklies, comic strips and
the local “rag”.
I lived in America during the period
of Miss McCarthy’s “Group”, and the
things described in that work (or hinted
at) were commonplace in certain cliques
and on the campuses from California to
New Jersey.
With unbridled licence on stage and
screen almost everywhere and social be-
havior reaching a new low, it may be
pertinent to consider seriously if a cen-
sor is really necessary.
There ought to be a moral, some-
where in all this, but it appears unlikely
that freedom of choice over what we
read, see, or hear will ever be accorded
this generation.

THE BENN CASE
Sir,
I want to protest as strongly as pos-
sible against the outrageous and bar-
barous sentence passed on Maurice
Benn in Western Australia. Only those
who have experienced life with severely
retarded children can have any idea of
the ordeal to which the Benns have been
subjected. In such a case, the degree
of retardation is of great relevance. The
communication possible with mongols,
for example, is incomparably greater
than that possible with a child as severely
retarded as the Benns’. The attempt to
cope with such a child in its home must,
at some stage be abandoned, because a |
woman ceases to be able to lift or re- j
strain the child.
Mr Benn, it is urged, should have
committed his child to an institution.
This is indeed the legal solution; it may
not necessarily be the morally correct
one. In my ignorance I must leave this
to the theologians and merely refer to
two cases I know of, where parents have
resorted to the institutional solution.
In one case, the family kept the child
(unable even to sit up and apparently
recognising no one) until the moth er
could no longer lift her; then with t e
utmost agony of mind she placedl tne
child in a State-run institution. The)
gradually ceased visiting her, unable
bear the sight of her increasing emac
ation. . j
In the other case the child, a e

seven, was placed in a State-subsidised
institution for several weeks while her
mother was in hospital. As there were
normal children in the family it was
hoped that the mother might be per-
suaded to leave the child in the institu-
tion permanently. After three weeks the
parents visited the child. The sedation
prescribed for it by their doctor to last
three months had been used up in three
weeks, the child had lost over a stone
in weight and was extremely emaciated
and almost constantly asleep. They
could not bear to leave her there and
postponed the inevitable day when some
solution must be found.
I am not attacking the institutions that
deal with these cases. No happiness
for anyone can be gained by prolong-
ing the lives of these children. They
are incapable of comprehension, much
less intelligent than animals, subject to
convulsions, often spastic, and frequently
desperately distressed, to the extent of
biting themselves and tearing their flesh
with their fingernails. The only humane
course is heavy sedation, even though it
may result in premature death through
malnutrition.
That Mr Benn must stand trial for his
solution to this terrible dilemma must
in the present state of our laws, be ac-
cepted. That he should be ranked with
the most brutal murderers and con-
demned to death, without even a recom-
mendation for mercy, leaves one mar-
velling at our savagery in this day and
age. This verdict can take its. place
beside the achievements of our early
penal authorities.

THE TRUST
Sir,
Like Mr C. R. Badger, Director of
Victorian Adult Education, we've all had
high hopes for Dr Coombs’ Elizabethan
Trust (11/4/64). However* Mr Bad-
ger is incorrect on one small point
there is now no realistic possibility that
the Trust is about to scatter Old Totes
across Australia. Like that other heavily
publicised Good Work, Professor Quen-
tin's Playwright's Studio, it was a nebu-
lous and thoroughly impractical scheme
conceived in haste and abandoned with
pleasure once the event was no longer
good for free paragraphs in the Press.
That this kind of smoke-screen should
still be necessary is a bit dispiriting.
However, as Mr Badger so accurately
demonstrates from his owm experience
with the Trust, Dr Coombs’ organisa-
tion cannot easily learn from past mis-
takes.
The criticism of “fibre and integrity”
which Dr Coombs once called for from
the professionally qualified is the one
asset which could have balanced the long
Trust resume of artistic and managerial
debits. These days, however, profes-
sional opinion must usually remain dis-
creetly hushed, for the Trust’s many and
sensitive tentacles reach out in all direc-
tions.
• The possible remedy? An independent
voice or two on the Trust Board, as
tough with ‘'fibre and integrity” as is
necessary to counter the expedient opin-
ions which lead to the typically low
standard's of Trust staging, to muddled
extravagance and to a yet longer list of
failures.

THE DFRB FUND
Sir,
It is my considered opinion, and I
believe I am qualified to give one, having
been a contributor to the Defence
Forces Retirement Benefit fund since it
was instituted, that Mr Fairbairn’s state-
ment (21/3/64) is complete and utter
nonsense. It may fool those Hon.
Members who are qualified to be fooled,
but it will not fool any serving member
of the forces. Fancy a group captain
or colonel paying a paltry £4830 into
DFRB and drawing a pension of
approximately £35 p.w., when even a
lowly warrant officer in the Army would
pay in approximately £5500 in 37 years
service and retire at approximately £l3
p.w.
1 pay approximately £lOO p.a. into the
fund for 37 years (as the figures now
stand ) and on top of this, my gratuity of
£5O p.a. for 37 years goes into the pen-
sion fund, bringing my figures up to
£5500. Now, an officer in the Army gets
a gratuity of £2OO p.a., which reverts to
the pension fund on top of his yearly
payments; which means that the group
captain would be paying £2OO p.a. for
37 to 40 years plus normal contributions
of approximately £BOO p.a.
Another hole in this scheme is the
fact that returned servicemen are en-
titled to old age pensions at 60 years
so that if one retires at 55 on £l3
p.w. he only draws this amount in actual
fact for five years, and then the differ-
ence between the two pensions comes
from the DFRB because he has paid
for old age pensions in his taxes. H e
would have to live until he was approxi-
mately 70 years before he would even
get back the money he put into the fund.

National Notebook
Largesse
Elizabethan Theatre Trust’s Press
reception for Dame Margot Fonteyn
and Rudolf Nureyev at the Chevron last
week was one of those enormous
epicurian romps that do little more than
make the stunned journalist wonder how
so many people could possibly get on a
Press guest list.
While we were chatting to people we
hadn’t seen since the last cocktail party,
Dame Margot sneaked in and was sub-
sequently pointed out by a tall gentle-
man as being the black and white hat
around which other more spectacular
hats could be seen diligently seething.
“I hear her hat cost six guineas,” the
observer volunteered, but whether he
was naive and considered
it expensive, or blase and
thought it unbecoming for
a Dame, we never found
out.
Many of the journalists
had come expecting some
sort of conference, but
found themselves overwhelmed with un-
expected largesse in the form of chicken,
canapes, roast beef sandwiches and three
kinds of spirituous liquor.
The gentleman who knew about the
hat had a theory on this, too. The Trust,
taking care of the pennies, had asked
the Chevron caterers the cheapest way
to refuel 300 people, and the Chevron
had wisely suggested champagne and
caviar. But after being twitted about
spending £42,000 on a tent, the Trust
must have felt doubtful about what
people would say about the seemingly
sinful extravagance of champagne and
caviar.
No Jazz Singer
Tn Sydney last week we went along to
a party offered by the local Sinhalese
colony to celebrate their New Year.
They confessed to us that nobody had
any idea what year it was in the
Sinhalese calendar—"these dates are only
used in reference to horoscopes to
determine whether such and such a day
is propitious for some new venture.”
We heard drummers, folk-singers, saw
dancers and were intrigued by a baritone
who rendered “Curley Headed Babee”
apologising because he didn't know any
of his own country's songs. But the
singer, Kamahl, told us he has spent
nearly all his life in Kuala Lumpur and
is now a Malaysian citizen.
"My parents moved their home from
Jaffna in north Ceylon when I was a
kid,” he told us. "My name is really
Kamal, but most people here made it
rhyme with ‘camel' so 1 put in the ‘h’.”
Tall, slim and dashingly handsome, he
came to Australia in 1958 to study.
“I’m not a Colombo Plan student; my
parents paid all my expenses. I’m study-
ing voice at the Conservatorium now,
but I started school in Australia at King’s
College, Adelaide. I took my Leaving
and went on to study architecture at
the university.”
He found architecture interested him
only slightly and, when friends urged
him to enter an amateur contest,
surprised everybody, himself included,
by winning first prize—a visit to Sydney.
One-man show
|7ve Langley’s “The Pea Pickers” may
be one of the great unread novels
of Australian literature. At least, there
is a feeling that it has not been read by
many people who would read it if they
could find it, and enjoy it if they read it.
“The Pea Pickers” won the S. H. Prior
Prize in 1941 and was republished by
Angus and Robertson in 1958. Douglas
Stewart called it “a unique refreshment
of our literature”.
“The Pea Pickers” has now emerged
in the form of a one-man show by Mrs
Joyce Goodes, producer for the Can-
berra Theatre Players. After 15 per-
formances in Canberra, Mrs Goodes
brings “The Pea Pickers” to Sydney’s
St James’ Hall from May 8 to 16. An
Arts Council tour of NSW is being
arranged.
Mrs Goodes did the adaptation of
“The Pea Pickers” herself. For her one-
man show she committed to memory
11,500 words and in it she plays 20
parts. Mrs Goodes plays without props,
except a reading-stand. She wears mole-
skin pants and changes from a purple
shirt to a red one at interval. Slacks
and shirt are Mrs Goodes’ 1964 version
of the men’s clothes which the two girls
in “The Pea Pickers”, Steve and Blue
Beesknees, wore.
Mrs Goodes said that she read “The
Pea Pickers” when it first appeared. As
a preparation for her one-man show she
visited Miss Langley, who now lives in
the Blue Mountains. She said Miss
Langley is now writing a novel based on
her years in New Zealand. Mrs Goodes
said she believed that her one-man show
was the first time that an
Australian novel had ever
been presented as a one-
man show. Her aim was
to give the flavor of the
book so that people would
want to read the whole
book. After her Can-
berra season there were waiting lists at
Canberra libraries.

A few months ago Kamahl decided he
had exhausted all opportunities offering
in Adelaide and moved to Sydney, where
he continued his studies under Harold
Williams, “I like to sing Handel and
Schubert, but I soon realised that if I
wanted to make a living I’d have to
compromise,” he said. “I have accepted
engagements in night-clubs and hotels.
I've just finished a season at the Aus-
tralia —it went very well.”
He has discovered that Sunday
smokos in RSL clubs, while not in the
first line of cultural achievement, pay
very well. “They usually want pops,
but I work in a few serious numbers and
they don’t mind. In fact it’s a wonder
to me anything gets through the smoke
screens they set up in those places and
yet they keep giving me repeat book-
ings.”
A few months ago he was offered the
bass role in Handel’s Messiah at a
church recital. “I loved doing it; it
made a contrast to a previous engage-
ment.” He smiled, “I was billed as a
jazz singer in an all-Negro road show.
They asked me did I mind being taken
for a Negro. I didn’t mind what they
took me for, but I’m no jazz singer. I
was glad when the show folded after
three weeks.”
Voices
YU e talked last week with Hazel de
"" Berg, of Sydney, and asked how
she was making out with her lone enter-
prise of tape - recording Australian
writers and artists reading and dis-
cussing their work. This was something
she started in 1957, when she was taping
“Old Days Old Ways” for the Blind
Book Society. She had the idea of ask-
ing Mary Gilmore to include a few words
on how the book was written, and in
agreeing to this Mary Gilmore suggested
that Judith Wright might record some
poems, too. Judith Wright in turn
suggested Douglas Stewart, and that was
how it began. “I just kept on,” Mrs de
Berg told us. “There are over 300
recordings now. B E that’s no satisfac-
tion. I only think of the ones I’ve
missed! And the others still to get...”
Mrs de Berg’s unaffected admiration
for her subjects has carried her round
the country mainly at her own expense,
though she has had some assistance from
the Commonwealth Literary Fund and
the Art Advisory Board. Her tapes
finish up in the National Library as a
gift to posterity. Sixty - seven of the
poets have already been put on discs,
and other discs may follow.
As she knows such a lot of them, we
asked Mrs de Berg how she thought
Australian writers and artists measured
up these days. “The artists are right out
in front,” she said decidedly. “They’re
more sophisticated and up to date than
the writers. Our poets are wonderful,
but a lot of the fiction writers tend to
write backwards towards what is familiar
and old-time. It’s not us they’re writing
about.”

PLAIN ENGLISH
Whitlam Warns the Liberals
most significant thing about
Mr Whitlam’s recently publicis-
ed report on the defects of the ALP
is its mildness. He only said the
sort of thing that most members
of the Labor Party have been say-
ing for years; that a mediocre, Left-
ist, extra-Parliamentary machine
has reduced the Parliamentary
Party to impotence, that the
machine-controlled Federal Con-
ferences closed to the public
and to the Press do the Party
more harm than good; and that the
Communists control many unions
which constitute the Labor Party
and therefore can manipulate the
Labor Party. Mr Whitlam was
right, despite some critics, to con-
centrate on organisation rather than
on policy, because although Labor’s
suicidal defence and foreign policies
lose votes, the ALP will not be
able to produce good policies until
it gets its organisation in order.
It was doubtless for this reason,
too, that Mr Whitlam did not bring
up nationalisation.
The significance of Mr Whitlam’s
criticisms lies not in what he said
many other Labor reports said
the same things more emphatically
but in the fact that a senior
Labor leader has said it. This
means that ten long years after
Dr H. V. Evatt wrecked the Labor
Party and men like Mr F. E. Cham-
berlain climbed to power on the
wreck, one leader at last has stated
the facts plainly. It means, further,
that the long-advocated reforms
may at last be begun.
The crucial decisions now lie
with the country’s largest and
wealthiest trade union, The Aus-
tralian Workers Union not over
where it stands, which is well
known, but over what it w ill do.
The Left wing and Right wing
balance each other and the AWU
has the ball at its feet.
It was only because the AWU
decided to support Dr Evatt in the
early 1950 s that the Party turned
Left-wing, and now it has the power
turn the party back to the centre.
With AWU backing and with
leadership from men like Mr Whit-
lam, the Labor Party may at long
last be able to produce a real alter-
native government.
There is a warning for the Liberal
Party in this. Too often it has
prospered on the follies of the
Labor Party.
Seato ...
lI?HAT a melancholy spectacle
* the SEATO Conference in
Manila presented to the world. The
Treaty Organisation has been in
existence for 10 years but never
have the divisive forces in it been
so apparent. While it is true that
SEATO has certainly proved a
deterrent to open Red Chinese
aggression in South-East Asia—in
other words US naval and mili-
tary power - it has been quite un-
able to prevent the Communist sub-
version of Laos, the near disaffec-
tion of Cambodia and the gradual
erosion of South Vietnam. While
some of these results have been the
result of the difficulty of composing
ancient feuds among the South-East
Asian states themselves it has been
mainly the result of a lack of com-
mon direction and purpose among
the signatory powers as to what
should be done to keep South-East
Asia politically and militarily intact.
Pakistan’s quite obvious disgust
with SEATO the result of that
country’s brooding suspicion of
British and American military aid
to India is one example. Another
is the virtual abdication of respon-
sibility in the area by France. The
French argument skilfully de-
molished by Australia’s Minister
for External Affairs that South-
East Asia should and could be
neutralised is the hollowest of
dreams. Neutralising South-East
Asian countries seems about the
best way of ensuring as in the
case of Laos an open Red
Chinese takeover. It is now quite
obvious, despite strong statements
made at the Manila Conference by
the United States and Britain, not
to mention Thailand and Australia,
that the Treaty Organisation can-
not take very much more in the
way of internal dissensions. The
question now is not merely where
does SEATO go from here but has
it anywhere to go at all?
...and Anzus
INDONESIA Has always had a
number of comprehensible and
semi-historical objections not only
to Malaysia but to the way in which
Malaysia was initially sponsored
and formed; objections which a far
greater number of people in this
country have tried to understand
than Djakarta has perhaps realised.
But there is a limit to both under-
standing and sympathy when objec-
tions express themselves in the
Confrontation of outright aggres-
sion and acts of subversion against
a country finally born with the
blessing of the United Nations and
expecting to live in peace with her
huge neighbor.
The Australian Government’s de-
cision to send troops to Borneo is
a decisive one and we must bear
whatever consequences flow from
it. They could be unpleasant,
perhaps for decades. Equally, Sir
Garfield Barwick’s unqualified state-
ment that an attack by Indonesian
forces on Australian forces ir.
Borneo will invoke the Anzus
Treaty and bring the US into open
conflict with Indonesia is the clear-
est possible warning Indonesia
could expect of the grave conse-
quences attendant on following hei
present course. Will Indonesia
take stock of the position into
which she has steadily and fatally
manoeuvred herself and against
which Djakarta’s usual political and
diplomatic skills have been unavail-
ing? For an industrially backward
country in economic chaos, politi-
cally weak and without friends or
allies, to pursue the self-defeating
course of invasion in Borneo must
seem an act of madness; a final
act of self-destruction that Indo-
nesia’s many friends in this countrv
genuinely hope will not occur.


THIS AUSTRALIA
THE LABOR PARTY
Mr Whitlam v.
the Machine
Will the politicians forget?
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
GOUGH WHITLAM
Reformation
1%/I'r Gough Whitlam, Deputy Federal
Labor Leader, has put himself firmly
into opposition to the controllers of the
ALP machine. He has questioned the
value of the machine that for decades
has been the symbol of Labor policy-
making and that has degraded Federal
Labor parliamentarians to the status of
over-age office boys. The machine con-
trollers will undoubtedly fight back.
Whitlam advocates not patching but
the replacement of the existing machine,
which he regards as archaic, with party
machinery more appropriate to a modern
age, in which social conditions have
changed dramatically from those which
prevailed when the old machine was
adequate.
What he wants is a Federal Confer-
ence meeting annually, open to the Press,
as large and representative as its
British and New Zealand counterparts,
and one in which Federal electorates,
Federal unions, Federal parliamentarians
and candidates endorsed by Labor for
Federal seats would have a voice in
policy-making. Adoption of the Whitlam
conference plan would mean that, what-
ever form of control did emerge, it
would be different from the present
control and give the Federal Parlia-
mentary Labor Party a chance to regain
its lost status in the council of the Party.
As Whitlam sees it, aside from its
electoral appeal, parliamentary influence
upon Party policy-making is necessary
because of changed social conditions
(which are responsible for, in Whitlam’s
words, “the percentage of citizens who
are eligible for membership of trade
unions constantly falling”). Further,
because of the immense complexity of
modern-day problems, “on many issues
and particularly on increasingly import-
ant issues such as foreign affairs and
defence, the parliamentarians should be,
and are, the best informed members of
the Party”. As things stand at the
moment many of Labor's most important
policy decisions are made by the Party
members least qualified to make them.
Whitlam has put his thoughts on paper
with a frankness rarely equalled by a
major Labor leader in recent years. In
my view he is voicing lucidly and realis-
tically the views and feeling not only
of a large section of Labor’s rank and
file but also of the majority of the
Federal Parliamentary Labor Party. But
I think he made mistakes in the way
in which he set out his views. He may
be right in his assessment of the poor
quality of Labor parliamentarians.
Personally I do not think it is as poor
as he makes out. My feeling is that
if the parliamentarians were not so
crushed and cowed by the machine they
might show quality of a better order.
But Whitlam did criticise his col-
leagues, even though after his report was
publicised last week by “The Daily
Telegraph” he engagingly included him-
self in the criticisms he had offered. This
is his Achilles’ Heel with the Party,
Parliamentarians resent criticism. It
was Whitlam’s reflections upon their
capacity that registered most deeply with
them, and his reflections could cost him
dear in future Caucus votes. But the test
now is not so much whether Whitlam
personally can outfight the present
machine controllers as whether the idea
for Party reformation he has put for-
ward can prevail against the authority
of the present machine controllers and
bring about a restoration of parlia-
mentary-wing influence in the Labor
Party.
Whatever happens, Whitlam, and the
ideas he has put forward, are not going
to get Left-wing support. He has commit-
ted the unforgiveable sin. He has form-
ally, and on paper, recorded his dis-
approval of the handling of the Unity
Ticket issue and the condoning of the
extension of Communist infiltration ol
the trade union movement.
It will be interesting to see whether
the large-sized stone Whitlam has flung
into the Labor pool produces continu-)
ing ripples or whether the present Left-
ist machine controllers can eliminate
Whitlam by having his influence —and
possibly himself removed from the;
front rank of the Federal Parliamentary
Labor Party.
EXPLORATION
The French Oil Report
Is Wapet doing enough?
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
/"iF the seven potentially oil-rich sedi-
mentary basins designated by the
French Petroleum Institute team which
has been examining Australia’s oil search
prospects for the Federal Government,
three covering practically the whole
tenanted area of Western Australia are
in the hands of a single group, Wapet, in
which Caltex, Ampol and Shell divide
the interest.
Although Wapet spent £2£ million
exploring this 285,000 square mile area
in WA last year, bringing its total search
expenditure to £2O million for some
90 unproductive wells, the French report
again raises the nagging questions
whether this is enough and whether
others should be given wildcatting rights
over Wapet’s vast areas in the west.
Admittedly other companies have
rights to search in areas around Wynd-
ham and also in the Kimberleys, while
Wapet has itself farmed out 11,5®
square miles in the Carnarvon Basin (of
not so hallowed Rough Range memory)
to two substantial US oil search com-
panies, Sun Oil and Continental Oil.
after so much unproductive expenditure
on its over-dispersed search effort, Wapet
must surely see that it will have to give
up more of its ground.
Indeed one of its partners, Shell, look s
to be somewhat disillusioned by the
search task in the west and, as well a s
pressing on with the search in Queen 5 '
land, is now to take on a new 49
square mile area off the coast of M
—the first offshore licence granted )
the NSW Government—though this area
is not one favorably regarded by


team, who see Bass Strait as the best
offshore bet. On shore, of course, the
French had to pick the Surat Basin,
already a winner with Moonie, and there
can be no complaints about tenements
there, even if drilling activity is slower
than it should be. Otherwise the French
think the Amadeus Basin, in Central
Australia where plenty of companies
have areas but where, again, search
is far too slow and intermittent, has
good prospects.
TASMANIAN ELECTIONS
Country Party has
the Key
Liberals chase the Catholic vote
FROM A HOBART CORRESPONDENT
E. REECE
“Stability”
An election promise by the Tasmanian
Liberal Party leader, Angus Bethune,
which has passed virtually unnoticed on
the mainland, represents the second
major break-through for Catholics on
State Aid within a year.
In an effort to end Labor's 30-year
'rule in Tasmania, Mr Bethune has, for
ill practical purposes, offered to pay for
the training of teachers for Catholic
schools. In his policy speech the Liberal
leader said that all trainee teachers
passing through the Education Depart-
ment would be allowed to choose their
iwn school, State or non-State.
Mr Bethune has also promised to
guarantee loans raised by non-State
schools for capital works and to intro-
duce a scheme whereby students at all
secondary and high schools will be able
0 hire text-books at a moderate cost.
Most Catholics have been temporarily
satisfied with the Labor Government’s
expanded bursaries to non-State schools.

!i ha/ e ! n^ de ’ { be Premier, Eric Reece,
I eclare d his party will rely on
1 Uove mment’s record of “political
stability and development” during the
past five years.
The Country Party State president
(Mr E. Reynolds) produced no surprises
in a policy heavily orientated to the
interests of the primary producer and
a promise to abolish heavy State probate
taxes. Nevertheless the CP's last-minute
announcement that they will direct
preferences to candidates supporting
“free enterprise and orderly marketing”
has brightened Liberal hopes.
Despite a balanced programme, Mr
Bethune faces a Herculean task. Firstly,
he has the handicap of two renegade
Liberal members standing as Indepen-
dents in Denison and Franklin. Secondly,
there is the intrusion of the CP for the
first time since the 19205. The Country
Party, revived in Tasmania last year, has
organised intensively and now boasts
strong branches in all country areas.
The CP has claimed it could win
enough seats from Labor to form a coali-
tion government with the Liberals. One
of the CP’s main problems has been a
leader with a good public image. The
State president (Mr “Robbie” Best,
MLC) was a nominal leader until three
weeks ago when he withdrew from the
presidency, because of ill-health, in favor
of a Franklin chemist-orchardist, Mr
Reynolds.
The CP has nominated full teams for
the State's five seven-seat electorates. As
the party will have to poll well in the
cities, if it is to have any chance of win-
ning even one of the 35 seats, it has en-
dorsed a variety of candidates from far-
mers and orchardists to an undertaker.
If it can win only one seat from Labor,
Mr Reece will lose his slender majority.
Even though the ABC has allotted the
CP no time for election broadcasts
(because its allocations are based on per-
centages of the vote won in the preceding
election) the CP is the key to the election.
THE UNIONS
The Leftists’
Last Ditch
Dumping Souler
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
Left wing at Melbourne Trades
Hall Council are working des-
perately to prevent the election of Mr
M. (“Mick”) Jordan to the Secretary-
ship. They have picked their strongest
possible candidate in Mr Jack Wood,
one-time Assistant Secretary to the ALP
and since 1957 a THC representative on
the Supplementary Workers’ Compensa-
tion Board. In the process of mustering
votes for Wood, the Left wing have
worked swiftly and ruthlessly, their most
notable victim being Mr H. Souter, Sec-
retary to the ACTU.
Until last week Mr Souter was a
delegate to the Melbourne THC where
he represented the Geelong Trades Hall
Council. He is one of the nation’s most
experienced union officials, an authority
on industrial law and had represented
Geelong for seven years. Unfortunately
for him, it was believed by the Left wing
that his vote would be cast for Jordan.
Mr Souter was removed from his position
as Geelong delegate and replaced by a
reliable Wood supporter in a 33 to
23 vote poll.
Casting their eye over other provincial
Trades Halls which have delegates who
will vote in the Jordan v. Wood contest,
the Left wing took action to change the
representatives from Castlemaine and
Bendigo. The former was represented
by Mr Doug Burgess, one-time research
officer for the Melbourne THC who is
now working as an AWU organiser. The
Bendigo delegate, Mr J. Francis, an
organiser of the Storemen and Packers
union, was also considered a Jordan
supporter. Messrs Burgess and Francis
were, like Mr Souter, rolled from their
positions.
Even ACTU President, Mr A. E.
Monk, had some worrying moments. Mr
Monk attends the Melbourne THC as
the delegate of the Mildura unions and
his recent visit to the Sunraysia City is
believed to have been to beat off a Left-
wing attempt to unseat him.
Out of these moves the Left wing
have Won three more votes but at the
cost of arousing considerable animosity.
Mr Wood will poll better than any other
candidate the Left could run, but Mr
Jordan still remains odds-on favorite
About 280 THC delegates are entitled
to vote in the election and both can-
didates have issued circulars seeking
support. So far, the printed material
from both candidates has been restrained
and free of mud-slinging.


BUSINESS
Parliament’s Pitiful
Ignorance
Foreign capital , alumina and biscuits
F. C. CREAN
Shadow
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
\ fter recently chiding the United
States for its virtual ban on foreign
bond issues, it was a pity the Federal
Treasurer, Mr H. Holt, did not come
into the House of Representatives while
Labor members were attacking the
Qantas American loan last week when,
in the absence of a senior Minister to
clarify the issues, the poverty of
economic expertise revealed from both
sides of the House was pitiful. Even
Mr Frank Crean, the shadow-Treasurer,
seemed to have only a vague idea that
it would be necessary for the Govern-
ment to raise counterpart funds here in
the event of dipping into overseas re-
serves as an alternative to making the
loan, while a number of speakers talked
about the overseas reserves as if they all
belonged to the Government and still
others apparently had not learned to
distinguish between capital and revenue.
However, with the £ll million to be
borrowed for Qantas, and with Comalco
announcing that U.S. banks are putting
up £s2m. long - term capital for its
projected alumina plant at Gladstone
(Queensland), it has been a good week
for those who believe not only that Aus-
tralia can make local capital go so much
further if supplemented by overseas
borrowing but also that the latter is very
useful in buttressing overseas reserves
(even in a year when a surplus is
accruing on current overseas trading
account), not to speak of the benefit of
garnering dollars for the impoverished
sterling areas’ gold and dollar reserves
at a time of weakness in Britain’s balance
of payments.
Preceding all this, Labor leader Mr
A. Calwell had been hotfooting against
overseas capital interests and, by implica-
tion, the possibility of the reserves
getting another nice haul from Nabisco
the American firm bidding against the
Australian Biscuit Company for Swallow
and Ariell, without adequate recognition
that, as Nabisco intends to bake biscuits
here anyway and will certainly add
something to the economy both in
capital outlay on new facilities and by
introducing the latest technical advances
in biscuit-making, the £1.2 million ini
volved in its present offer would bt
largely net gain to our resources.
It was left to Mr N. L. Beaton, Labe:
member for Bendigo, to draw the las;
sinister ounce from Nabisco’s present!
here when he asked the Attorney
General, Mr B. M. Snedden, whether!
would take whatever steps are availat:
to him to ensure that Nabisco, by tab
over of the Australian Biscuit Compare
will not be permitted at one foul swot
to gain monopolistic control of the Ac
tralian biscuit industry.
Mr Snedden could well feel, howeve:
that while it may have been Nabisco
original design to swallow piecemeal It
fragmented proprietaries which ultimate
joined forces to form the Australia
Biscuit Company and so thwart p
design, there was more sting in I
Beaton’s other questions pointing to tl
inherent dangers of the ABC’s o»r
‘’dominant position approaching con
plete domination in the Australia
biscuit industry’’ in the event of it getti
control of Swallows.
As the Attorney-General’s restrict
practices proposals are aimed not at fa
breaking up of Australia's monopoly
but at the individual practices the®
selves, and as no suggestion has coffi
from Canberra of Sherman-like legist
tion, Mr Frank Gurgone, Nabisco
negotiator in the bid for Swallows, In
possibly had the last laugh. Talking
Melbourne last week about the ABt
present 70 per cent of the Austral!-
biscuit market, he said “American to l
would not allow one company to cot
trol that much of the market — but I
not criticising Australian law.”
AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE
ffiJiulletCn
80 Years Ago: April 26, 1884
11/here would our defence force be
” if an enemy landed? To ask this
question, it is urged by not a few fools,
is to disparage the valor of our
troops. The question, in reality, is
not one about efficiency. We suppose
that, man for man, the men of New
South Wales are as brave as those of
any other country. We leave it to
idiotic Podsnaps to suppose that they
are braver. The point is, are our paid
troops as professionally expert as
those which might be landed here with
hostile intentions? It doesn't need a
great authority to say “No" to that
query. Our troops are neither one
thing nor the other, neither trained
volunteers iior thoroughly well-
officered regulars. To rely upon it
is to rely upon a broken reed
without any disparagement of its
members' individual pluck.

A respondent from Paris) what a

Americans. Hardly a day passes but

dent had with Sir Henry Parkes, who
asserts that his visit to Europe is
specially in connection with the New

of this interview have not impressed
people here greatly with his political
sagacity. His puerile threat of closing
the Australian ports to French trade
is unworthy of a man who poses as
a statesman. As to the question it-
self, you may rest quite assured that
the French will annex the New Hebri-
des whenever they are required, in
spite of all the Australian Convention
may do. If the Australians wish to be
beforehand they must act without
delay.

Queensland has not had an Attorney-
General with legal qualifications since
Neal Macgroarty was beaten in 1932.”
Almost seven years have elapsed since
the Country - Liberal Government was
elected, yet Queensland is still without
a legally qualified Attorney-General. Of
the original member-barristers, one has
been appointed from the back-bench to
the Bench; another did not gain party
selection after the Redistribution; and
only Raymund Smith remains.
Mr Smith was admitted to the Bar in
1952. In 1957 he won the difficult seat
of Windsor from Tom Rasey, and in the
last election increased his majority with-
out any overt assistance in his campaign
from top party brass. He is in very good
standing in his profession and is a good
Parliamentary debater. He has the dis-
tinction, it is generally believed, of being
the only Roman Catholic in the Liberal
Party since Neal Macgroarty.
When Dr Noble, the Minister for
Health, died suddenly during the Easter
holidays a Cabinet position fell vacant.
It is assumed that Dr Peter Delamothe,
the Attorney-General, will immediately
(or after a brief interregnum) become
Minister for Health, consistently with his
personal inclinations and aptitudes and
with vaunted party policy.
On Tuesday, April 7, the 18 members
of the Liberal Party voted to select a
Cabinet Minister. The Premier, Mr
Nicklin, did not indicate which Ministry
would fall to the lot of the successful
candidate. One of several possible
motives is that he wished to save the
voters the embarrassment of considering
the suitability of any candidate for any
specific post.
The number of candidates who con-
sidered themselves capable of adhering
to any political post was most gratifying.
Of the 18 voters, 12 were candidates and
Mr Tooth, who began with 2 (including
presumably his own) emerged victorious.
The voting showed that the Liberal
Ministers did not want Mr Smith as
A-G, for he appears to have picked up
no votes after his initial six.
The virtual certainty that Dr Dela-
mothe would move on to Health from
Law stimulated the Bar and the Law
Society, in the preceding week, to make
representations to the Government for a
legally qualified A-G. One might have
expected the Government to seize the
opportunity to placate both those who
suspect, on statistical grounds, that the
Liberal Party does not want Roman
Catholics and those members of the
legal profession (the great majority)
who resent the policy “No lawyer need
apply”.
Queensland looks like improving its
unassailable record for having square
pegs in round holes, with no com-
petitors in sight.
LEGAL AID
The Case of Mr & Mrs M.
The luxury of litigation
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
A lthough NSW has had a system of
State legal assistance in civil cases
dating since 1908, and of legal aid for
criminal matters since 1907, the opera-
tion of these two systems has been
hampered by a harsh means test. The
Public Solicitor can grant legal assistance
for actions and proceedings in the
Supreme or District Court. In the
Petty Sessions court assistance can be
granted for landlord and tenant matters,
hire-purchase, lay-by, or certain kinds
of loans and mortgages. On the
criminal side the Public Defender will
act for accused persons in Quarter Ses-
sions and the Central Criminal Court,
but not in Petty Sessions (as a general
rule).
At present the limit for the permis-
sible income for an applicant is £BOO a
year, increasing by £75 for each depend-
ant. What this does, in effect, is to cut
out a large number of the population
who earn between about £l6 and £2O
a week.
But this section of the population has
rarely had a chance, if married, to
accumulate sufficient savings to embark
on litigation. If they have more than
£2OO in property or cash they are not
eligible for any assistance (excepting an
equity of up to £3,000 in a home).
One case which recently came to The
Bulletin’s attention shows what hap-
pens: Mr and Mrs M bought a low-
price home from a builder in one of
the outer Sydney western suburbs. The
price was £3359, of which £2BOO was a
bank loan. The deposit, moving expenses
and previous expenditure on furniture
had eliminated their savings. Shortly
after moving in, extensive faults became
obvious in the bathroom, ceilings, cup-
boards, bedrooms, kitchen, laundry and
windows. The retention fund provided
for in the contract was of the order of
£BO, far from enough to meet the costs
of repairs for which two quotes were
obtained £465 and £350.
The plight of the couple was further
complicated by the fact that builders
are reluctant to do such repair jobs, be-
cause they require more work and p 0 $.
sible liability for undeveloped faults,
So confronted with the need for litiga-
tion, Mr and Mrs M found that their
only recourse was to a District Court
action. Minimum legal costs would be
£l5O, of which only two-thirds could be
recovered if successful. If defended,
delays of up to a year are not uncommon
in the District Court, which has a fan
tastic backlog of work. An arbitrator
provided for under the contract was an-
other possibility, but costs of specialist
witnesses and the arbitrator could be
more than a court action.
As a semi-skilled tradesman (a tyre
moulder), Mr M’s income was enougt
to push him beyond the assistance of
the Public Solicitor. So Mr. and Mrs
M, having exhausted their immediate
savings in getting their home, were con-
fronted with the dilemma of whether to
go to court committing themselves to
more expense (with the possible threat
that the building company, not a bi \
one, could quite possibly be insolventbj
the time the case came to a hearing) or
cutting their losses and spending all theii
money and current savings on the hun-
dreds of pounds of repairs needed.
The NSW means test has not bees
adjusted since 1957 and the system need)
a thorough re-examination and adjust-
ment to more realistic estimates of wbil
constitutes a low-income today.
On cheaper homes, solicitors would
like to see a review of the usual contract
clause providing for retention funds d
only 1 2 per cent of cost price for three
months as a safeguard to the buyer
Such a figure is useful for bigger cos-
tracts but with cheaper homes, hui
have a tendency to cost more.

resign will have failed; if not then the
case can proceed to hearing.
Even though the plaintiff in this case
is Lt R. C. O'Dea, an RAN jet pilot
instructor stationed at Nowra, the High
Court's decision on it would certainly
directly affect the other case pending—
that of Army Captain Mervyn Marks,
who was the first service officer to
launch such an action where a demurrer
is also pending.
The effect of the demurrer may well
be to force further delays before the
cases come to hearing and to make extra
demands on the fund raised by service
officers to support Captain Marks’ action.
While rumors are rife on possible
improvements in pay and conditions,
there are no firm developments. The
Minister for Defence, Mr P. Hasluck,
over a month ago spoke of making a
statement in three weeks but at the point
of going to press he has been silent.
The proposal from within the Defence
Department for the appointment of an
Arbitrator to look at the whole question
of service pay and conditions has now
apparently been passed over. It is
reported that Sir Victor Windeyer of
the High Court was approached but
refused the appointment because he
could not spend enough time on the
assignment. Now the possibility of a
committee is being canvassed, with some
figure like Sir John Allison as chairman.
Resignations continue to be rejected
in the army. There has also been some
comment among officers on the fact that
a Brigadier is being allowed to resign to
take up a post with a State Governor,
some three years before retiring age.
But although there has been criticism of
this anomaly, such late resignations are
allowed under pension regulations out-
side the scope of the Defence Act.
UNIONS
Post-mortem in the GPO
Put the blame on “Fearless Frank ”
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
T>epercussions caused by the Sydney
* mail strike have just begun. It was
soon clear that when the general sec-
retary of the Amalgamated Postal
Workers’ Union, Mr G. Slater, mounted
the rostrum at the Sydney Town Hall
dramatically waving a piece of paper
(the agreement) in front of 3000 strikers
and exclaimed: “You have defeated the
Menzies Government,” he was stating
something less than the facts.
Once this was realised the hunt for
a man responsible began. The four
trade union representatives who took
part in the negotiations at Canberra
were Mr Albert Monk, the ACTU presi-
dent; Mr Jim Kenny, secretary of the
NSW Labor Council and senior vice-
president of the ACTU; Mr F. J. (“Fear-
less Frank”) Waters, the Queensland
secretary and Federal president of the
APWU; and Mr Slater.
Mr Monk is already under attack from
Left-wing and Communist union leaders,
both over the terms of the settlement
and his condemnation of the Shop
Committees. The Communist weekly,
“Tribune”, which first proclaimed the
settlement as “complete victory”, now
attacks Monk and Kenny for the
settlement but soft-pedals on Slater.
It is reported that Kenny opposed the
agreement; certainly his name does not
appear on the official circular sent out
by the APWU on the terms of the agree-
ment.
So the scapegoat in the APWU must
be either Slater or Waters, both noted
for their “far Left” attitudes.
The well-organised Communist Party
branch in the GPO was not among the
early leaders of the strike (which appears
to have been based on genuine industrial
grievances) but spent much of the time
catching up with events, finally gaining
control of one committee. When the
terms of the agreement were publicised,
its members were amongst those most
hostile to Slater, but they were instructed
by the Party leaders to back Slater and
break down hostility against him. For
the Left wing and the CP made a quick
assessment and realised that while it was
practically impossible to lose control of
the Queensland branch of the APWU
and any Left wing nominee of theirs
could win the position, Slater could
easily be toppled from his position by
a “moderate” candidate in a showdown.
Waters then is expendable.
But Waters is fighting for his political
life and may put up a struggle that will
split the Left wing in Queensland. He
apparently sensed that he might be used
as a whipping boy before he left Sydney
when he said that Slater “made a mistake
in not explaining fully the terms of the
settlement to the Town Hall meeting”.
Whatever happens it is unlikely that
the Sydney postal workers will forget Mr
Slater and his over-extravagant phrases.

TRADE
The Hard Sell
Lies Ahead
The “ Centaur ” half way
FROM JOHN MOYES IN MANILA
is the half-way point for the
biggest trade mission ever to leave
Australia. It marks a dividing line in
more ways than one. Behind the trade
ship Centaur lie the lands of “joint
ventures”.
Ahead are the ports of “hard sell”—
Hong Kong, Osaka and Tokyo.
So far the mission has been an out-
standing success. Sales and prospects in
Singapore were good, Bangkok was
better, and the reception in Manila has
most mission members itching to get
back to continue negotiations begun
during Centaur’s hectic 48-hour stay.
There seems no doubt that Australia will
increase her exports to these areas con-
siderably in the next few months, and
that the increase by this time next year
could be really spectacular. Sales have
been made and negotiations for sales are
well under way through a wide range
of products—from plastic buttons to 50-
ton presses, from locks to hospital equip-
ment, from fashions to cars.
Mission members some of them,
anyway have realised, however, that
though the short-term export prospects
are rosy the long-term picture may not
be so bright. They have seen other
countries, particularly Japan, the United
States, France and Hong Kong, estab-
lishing joint ventures in Malaysia, Thai-
land and the Philippines. And they
realise that unless Australian industry
moves fast it will not be many years
before tariff barriers will close the doors.
These Asian countries have a fierce
nationalism. They are determined to be
partners in their own progress.
All of them welcome joint-venture
proposals—and if the proposal is a good
one they are not fussy from which
country the proposal comes.
Australia has a good name in
Malaysia, in Thailand and in the Philip-
pines. Some Australian joint ventures
have been operating here for years. Ten
more are being negotiated in Singapore
at present and others are under way in
Thailand. One Australian-Filipino com-
pany was announced during Centaur's
short stay in Manila.
The mission leader, Sir Frank Ledger,
has been at pains to stress, at all Press
conferences, that though the mission is
essentially a selling one, the 112 dele-
gates on board are eager to discuss
joint-venture proposals. His remarks,
too, have been widely reported. All
this is good. But it is not good enough.
By 1970 the population of Malaysia,
Thailand and the Philippines will total
more than 90 millions.
Australia can share in this tremendous
growth. All three countries would
welcome Australia sharing in it. But it
seems that the businessmen of other
countries are moving faster than busi-
nessmen in Australia. They are setting
up joint-venture factories on extremely
favorable terms, and before long they
will be sheltering comfortably behind a
tariff wall which will protect them from
almost all competition.

Yes, salad oil! Australian Chemical Holdings, through its subsidiary Pacific Safflower (Australia) Pty. Ltd., have
been instrumental in starting a new primary industry.
Previously, before this enterprise initiated the growing of Safflower in this country, the oil was imported.
The oil from Safflower has been known as an excellent paint medium for years. More recently it has assumed
its place as the best edible oil for salads, mayonnaise, margarine, etc.

Gallipoli Today...
Even in 1964 bits of barbed wire, corroded cartridge clips and battered water-bottles
By ROBERT RAYMOND
To stand on the summit of Chunuk
Bair, the central crest of the
Gallipoli peninsula, is to come
face to face with history in a form so
perfectly preserved as to be eerie.
Facing south, the ground falls away
in ribbed folds towards the pointed tip
of the peninsula, Cape Hellas.
To the right stretches the glittering
Aegean Sea, with the misty hump of
Samothrace on the western horizon, and
the grey bulk of Imbros closer in. All
this is Europe.
To the east is Asia, separated from
Gallipoli by the narrow, dark waters of
The Dardanelles; here runs a cold, four-
knot current that flows from the Black
Sea through the Bosphorus, past the 500
mosques of Istanbul (which sounds much
better as Constantinople), into the Sea
of Marmora, and finally into the Aegean.
Here, where Asia and Europe press
close, within 1200 yards of each other
at The Narrows, even the sketchiest
recollection of history, ancient and
modern, feeds the mind with images of
heroic assaults on The Dardanelles:
Xerxes crossing it on a bridge of boats;
Leander swimming it to see Hero; and
Byron swimming it to see if Leander
could really have done it.
There are fortresses of various periods
on both sides of The Dardanelles, on the
Asiatic mainland and on the Gallipoli
peninsula. Practically every conqueror
who passed this way seems to have built
new forts to cover his retreat, or
knocked down the ones already there to
facilitate his advance. The older the
forts, the better they seem to last.
And yet the most recent invaders,
although they built no forts, have left,
after 50 years, a sense of their presence
here on Gallipoli that is so strong that
it makes the scalp tingle.
This is because of the uniquely isolated
nature of Gallipoli. Nowhere else in the
world was so concentrated a war fought
in such an uninhabited region.
When the Allies came over the
horizon, with their plan to force the
straits, capture Constantinople, and
knock 1 urkey out of the war, they found
a peninsula inhabited only by scattered
farmers, and then only on the eastern
side, fronting The Dardanelles.
The western hills, sloping steeply
down to the cove w'here the Australians
and New Zealanders landed, were virgin
scrub, where not even sheep had grazed.
And since the Anzacs left, no one else
has moved into the area, except the
men of the War Graves Commission.
The result is that the battlefields
between Anzac beach and the summit
of Chunuk Bair, a few hundred feet
above, are still as they were when the
troops stole away to their boats in the
darkness.
The trenches still wind through the
gullies, although now they are beginning
to fill up with grass and shrubs. Every
kick of the foot turns up a rusty frag-
ment of barbed wire, a corroded cart-
ridge clip, a battered water-bottle.
It is not hard to find a skull or a
thigh bone half exposed under a bush.
So many men died here, in such con-
ditions of close and ferocious fighting,
that hundreds of bodies particularly
those of the Turks—were never properly
buried.
Those men who were found and buried
in a quiet, methodical operation that
has been going on since the early 19205,
lie in what must be surely the most
peaceful locations that ever marked the
violence of war.
The war cemeteries at Gallipoli are
sited all over the peninsula, at places
where the heaviest fighting occurred—
at Cape Hellas, where the British troops
were landed in daylight right in front
of the Turks; at Lone Pine, where the
Australians won seven VCs in four days
in hand-to-hand fighting; at Chunuk
Bair, where for a few hours a handful
of men gained the crest and looked down
on The Dardanelles, the object of all
their sacrifice, before Mustafa Kemal
hurled them off again.
The graves are marked by small,
square headstones, almost flush with the
turf, and trees have been planted all
around.
For thirty years these cemeteries were
fashioned and looked after by Major
Millington, an Australian war veteran.
He lived alone in the town of Channa-
kale, on the Asiatic side of The Darda-

lipoli collecting material for the special

documentary.

nelles, and never learned to speak a-word
of Turkish.
Major Millington died recently, and
his place has been taken by a young
Englishman, who continues, with his
staff Of Turkish gardeners, to improve
lawns and trees and shrubs that almost
nobody comes to look at.
All this may change if plans being
made by the Turkish Government to
encourage visitors find a response over-
seas.
The Turks have just as much reason
to remember Gallipoli as Australians
have and perhaps more.
The invasion came at a time when the
Ottoman Empire had collapsed and the
neighboring countries were tearing
chunks off the carcase of the Sultan’s
sprawling domain, which stretched from
Bulgaria in a great crescent round .the
eastern end of the Mediterranean to
Tripoli.
The Young Turks, a nationalist group
trying to maintain Turkey's indepen-
dence, were not eager to follow Turkey’s
traditional allegiance to Germany
(originally founded on mutual distrust
of Russia) to the extent of joining the
war against the Allies.
But Turkey was eventually involved,
and within a few months the great
Allied assault on The Dardanelles began.
The victory of the Turkish and German
gunners, in preventing the Allied fleet
from forcing The Narrows, and finally
the army’s feat in penning the Allied
armies into their two bridgeheads, gave
Turkey new hope, and provided Kemal
Ataturk with the impetus he needed to
defeat Greece, stabilise Turkey’s bound-
aries, and modernise the medieval,
despotic State.
Today Turkey, with 30 million people,
is still a long way from being what we
would call a modern State—but it dates
its progress from Gallipoli. Or Gelibolu,
as is the spelling of the small
fishing village that gives the peninsula
its name.
this little village still welcomes
its handful of boats back from the
fishing grounds each morning, while the
old men sit outside the coffee shops, and
the messengers hurry up the hill to the
mayor’s office with trays of tea, steaming
in tiny glasses.
An occasional jeep or military truck
drives through the square, because
Gelibolu is now, as it was 50 years ago,
the headquarters of the military governor
of the region.
It can hardly have changed much since
Liman von Sanders, the German com-
mander of the Turkish forces opposing
General Hamilton, settled in one of the
houses to direct, with unrelenting
tenacity, the defence of The Dardanelles.
We stayed in Gelibolu for one night
on our way down to the battlefields, after
driving for hours along the flat European
shores of the Sea of Marmora.
Arriving at midnight, we found one
dimly-lit hotel still open. The pro-
prietor showed us to a couple of rooms
that each had four beds, with a pair of
slippers beside each bed.
In the morning Alan Moorehead asked
the proprietor, in sign language that
appeared to be unmistakable, for hot
water for shaving. He was straightway
led round the corner and shown the
barbershop.
Eventually we got our water, amid
general disdain. Even the poorest Turk,
it seems, goes to the barber rather than
shave himself. However, the night cost
only four shillings each.
The only other sizeable village on the
peninsula is Sedd-il-Bahr, at Cape
Hellas, the extreme tip. The village
huddles round a huge Byzantine fortress
that lasted well until it was shelled very
heavily by the British before the land-
ing at X Beach—the main thrust of the
original Gallipoli invasion.
The Anzacs, landing in the early
dawn at a steep part of the west coast,
where they had been carried by cur-
rents, were almost unopposed because
nobody—least of all the Turks —con-
sidered it feasible. But at Sedd-il-Bahr
the British landed in daylight, and were
awaited. To stand and consider what
they tried to do is, even today, a sicken-
ing experience.
The beach designated by Hamilton
and his staff for General Hunter-Weston
and the 29th Division—a highly trained
British unit, the best involved in the
whole campaign—is perhaps 300 yards
wide. It slopes gently from the sea, and
then perfectly open grassy ground rises
evenly to low ridges.
The flanks are sealed, on the east by
the long, high walls of the old fortress,
on the west by a sheer cliff. When the
British arrived, in broad daylight, the
Turks were lying comfortably behind the
ridges 200 yards away, having taken
cover during the so-called “annihilation”
bombardment by the fleet.
All day men tried to reach the beach
from the grounded River Clyde, run»
ning down gangways from the sallyports
in the side. And all day the Turks
killed them, like ducks in a shooting
gallery^
Looking at the little waves rolling on
to that beach today, it is all too easy to
see it as Salmson, the pilot, saw it as he
flew over that day the sea scarlet for
more than fifty yards out from the shore,
with red waves breaking on the shingle.
On the cliff overlooking this beach,
where now the farmers plough without
concern (the shells and cartridges that
used to explode between their oxen’s feet
seem all expended), a huge granite
monolith has been erected to com-
memorate the entire Gallipoli campaign.
An the four faces, and on the low walls
that surround it, there are listed
all the units, from the ends of the earth,
that came to Gallipoli.
There is probably no other single war
memorial anywhere in the world that
calls up such a variety of images, of
scenes of embarkation and dedication —-
from the south island of New Zealand
to the lowlands of Scotland, from the
Punjab to the French Alps.
From the memorial, the low hump of
Achi Baba seems an easy hour’s walk
away. This low hill, about five miles from
the beach at Sedd-il-Bahr, represents the
distilled disillusionment of the whole
vast Allied force, and those who sent it
on its way.
The first great dream was, of course,
to reach Constantinople, thereby open-
ing up the Black Sea and sustaining
Russia.
Then the sights had to be lowered, to
merely capturing the Gallipoli peninsula.
And finally the great objective of the
whole campaign seemed to become the
taking of Achi Baba. And even that
proved unattainable.
The Cape Ffellas battlefield impresses
by its sheer deadly openness, and the
picture it throws up of men rushing
across flat ground at barbed wire and
rifle muzzles.
Anzac, on the other hand, bewilders
by the sheer impossibility of visualising
men clawing their way up those cliffs, to
fight hand-to-hand with bayonets, rifle
butts, and fists.
And yet, as Alan Moorehead has re-
marked, there is, about these sighing,
hilltop cemeteries, no feeling of death
and depression, but an overwhelming
sense of peace—as if the clean, washed
winds of the Aegean have somehow
blown away from this campaign the
stench of the slaughterhouse that hangs
over the Western Front.

OUT AND ABOUT
Faith and Good Works
Charity on an international scale
By JAN SMITH
66TT don't just walk into a strange
I country and tell them they meed
one of my homes,” said Group
Captain Leonard Cheshire, VC, newly
arrived in Sydney on his second visit to
Australia. But with the recent dis-
closures, through the Benn case, of our
shortage of homes for retarded and
defective children, he could hardly have
walked in at a more propitious time.
With his wife, former Resistance
worker Sue Ryder, the Group Captain
has established more than 50 homes in
various countries for the treatment and
maintenance of what could loosely be
termed hopeless cases. In the beginning
he concentrated on maimed and incur-
able ex-servicemen, and waged a long
campaign with Germany to get their
Government to pay reparations for con-
centration and labor camp victims and
their families. Today his homes care for
lepers, retarded and defective children,
the incurably ill and bedridden, stateless
Europeans and anyone who cannot be
helped by existing charities or hospitals.
The cases cared for at the Cheshire
homes run into thousands. Under the
National Health Scheme, in England, the
old and chronically sick, without families,
have no future but a hospital bed, with
no individual care and virtually no
exercise. And in England, as in almost
every other country, the number of sick,
retarded and defective children is much
more than the places available in homes
and hospitals.
He has always been especially in-
terested in children. “I’ve never really
known any retarded children in my own
circle,” he said, “apart from one in a
family I used to stay with as a child, but
from the thousands of cases I’ve seen,
I’ve learnt that consistent individual care
is what they need.
“The most rewarding thing about
caring for these children is to see the
personality coming through. We mustn’t
think that because they are short on
intellect and social skills that they haven’t
emotional needs just like anyone else.”
The flowering of the personality comes
from this same intensive care, but the
Group Captain, perhaps wisely in the
face of so many blanket statements on
the subject, will not say whether home
or institutional care is better.
In England, where the problem of
retarded and defective children is a
growing one, the Group Captain thinks
the greatest immediate need is for tem-
porary-care centres, where parents can
leave their children for a month or more
to give themselves a break. The Cheshire
homes are doing this wherever possible.
A Catholic since 1948, the Group
Captain is something of a convert extra-
ordinary, coming to the faith after an
Air Force career as a Dambuster and
later as Britain’s official observer for
the Nagasaki bomb dropping. The
beginnings of non-doubt had been sown
earlier in a West End cocktail bar. when
a woman challenged his untroubled con-
viction that God was an internal con-
science. “1 thought it was a damned odd
thing to discuss in a pub,” the Group
Captain said, “so I tried to change the
subject, but she just kept at me.
‘Absolute nonsense,’ she said. ‘He’s a
person,’ and that’s what really started it.”
With no money but an Air Force
pension, the Group Captain began his
good works with a farm-style home for
ex-servicemen, run on vaguely socialistic
lines and intended to be self-supporting.
It wasn't. “I was terribly idealistic about
doing something to help,” Cheshire re-
called. “The established charities didn’t
appeal to me, because they didn’t seem
to be doing the things I felt were urgently
needed,” he said.
Disillusioned, he went to Canada,
taking odd jobs like farmwork, far
removed from his postwar fling as a
“Sunday Graphic” columnist. Back in
England, he nursed a dying ex-service
friend, and set out with new dedication
for a second attempt at doing something
to help. By the time he met Miss Ryder,
who had been establishing her own
homes in Poland and Yugoslavia for
Nazi victims, his reputation as a helper
of the helpless was high throughout
England and Europe.
“Sue came to me in England to see if
I could help her with some desperate
cases in Germany,” the Group Captain
said. “Germany was granted sovereignty
in 1952, and the big international
charities like the Red Cross were pulling
out, leaving thousands of people with
no one to turn to. It wasn't exactly a
merger in the concrete sense, because
her homes are run a little differently
from mine, but marriage did mean we
could encourage and inspire each other.”
They were married in a Himalayan
palace in 1959 and came to Australia a
few weeks later. “It wasn’t a successful
trip in practical terms,” Cheshire said.
“We tried to do too much get money
for homes in India, arrange emigration
for displaced persons, investigate the
need for an Australian Cheshire home —•
all impossible to arrange in three weeks.”
Both had been married before, Miss
Ryder to a Resistance pilot who was
killed, and the Group Captain, at 22,
to the much older Hollywood actress

Constance Binney. Had he really been
as wild and feckless as the papers said?
“Well,” said Cheshire, with a nice, like-
able laugh, “all undergraduates are wild,
aren’t they? Even law students. I had
a fast sports car and spent a lot of time
at dog tracks, but I don’t any more. I
don’t believe one’s relaxation should be
too far removed from one’s work, so I
stick to something quiet and useful like
photography.”
Mrs Cheshire’s chief occupation away
from work is their two children, who
have cut down her trips to Ryder homes
in Europe. “She doesn’t have an
enormous staff of people at all,” Cheshire
said. “She just drives around by herself
and it’s nothing for her to stay up 18
or 20 hours a day, sometimes three days
running.” Mrs Cheshire also visits all
the alien prisoners in German gaols, and,
like her husband, supports her homes
almost entirely from small private dona-
tions.
Most of Mrs Cheshire's work is in
Poland, where the religious climate
helped toward her conversion to
Catholicism shortly before her marriage.
“1 didn't convert her at all. I’m afraid,”
Cheshire smiled, denying old newspaper
stories from overseas which mentioned,
among other things, that Mrs Cheshire
considered their marriage strictly a
business merger.
“More aggressive”
rpoDAY Mrs Cheshire has achieved a
safe, if not overly peaceful, co-
existence with the Communist Polish
Government. “I don't want to give any
details,” the Group Captain said, “but
you see she’s rather more aggressive than
I am about getting things organised. I'm
the sort of person who’ll settle for a
compromise, but not Sue.”
Cheshire himself doesn’t need the
aggression, because, without intending
any disrespect to Mrs Cheshire, he is
the sort of person people just naturally
like to help, and probably one of the
few international crusaders ever to be
offered a free suite by the Australia
Hotel. In Sydney he is being helped with
lecture and visit plans by Mrs Colleen
McLeod, a longtime helper of the Group
Captain’s in India. Mrs Barbara Cole-
man of Melbourne, secretary of the
Indian homes, is also managing tour
details.
A tall, serious, not-too-English English-
man, son of a legal expert and educated
at Stowe School and Oxford, the Group
Captain is still an easy, unassuming
talker far removed from the hardsell
do-gooder. “You’d better put all that
in there,” he said, looking a little
anxiously at the maid who’d arrived with
a trolley of cold beer for the reporters
assembling next door in the bedroom.

THE GIRL YOU'VE BEEN WAITING TO SEE
rpHE nicest part is at the beginning.
The Girl You’ve All Been Waiting
to See is seen immediately—seated on
a simple couch, wearing a simple twin
set, a smile to match and no jewellery.
This, then, is Christine Keeler? A
rather demure-looking young woman
with her skirt pulled discreetly over
her knees and an “Oh, hello there!”
expression in her wide-open eyes? Yes.
“My name is Christine Keeler,” she
confirms softly, precisely with no trace
of the embarrassment that Queens-
land members of the Country Women’s
Association feel ought to accompany
such an admission. “This is the story
of my life”, she goes on, “so it also
is the story of Dr Stephen Ward.”
Just him. No one else. Not even
a whisper of Jack, Bill or any of the
other boys. And so it begins—not,
as you might expect, with shots of
Miss Keeler in her nappy, but at her
first assignment as a professional
model posing in a briefer pair of
panties and bra. One gets the impres-
sion that she feels this is where her
life began.
Here Yvonne Buckingham takes
over the role and very like her in-
famous counterpart she looks, too.
There the resemblance seems to end,
however. Miss Buckingham portrays
Miss Keeler as the sort of girl any
Dad might be pleased to have for a
daughter when she is not drunk,
drugged or playing fast and loose with
a sexy Jamaican. The “story”, such
as it is, is told in a series of flash-
backs from a nightmare impression of
one of the Keeler appearances at the
d Bailey. As it is meant to be a
bad dream, the beatnik-bearded judge
and Victorian-type jury may be taken
as figments of the conscience-stricken
eeler imagination. Indeed, that is
bow they are presented.
But the flashbacks are meant to be
rea • These include a lengthy swirn-
mmg pool scene (strongly reminiscent
0 liveden, though the venue is not
named). This sequence really gets off
e ground when one of the girls is
stripped of her f owel on the run,
revealing a very fleeting glimpse of her
naked body complete with what
appears to be a patch of pubic hair.
As similar still-life pictures are con-
sidered obscene, however briefly
viewed, by Australian courts, some
sections of the national audiences at
large should be suitably shocked. Then
there is a party thrown in Stephen
Ward's flat by Christine for “some of
Mandy Rice-Davies’s friends”. (It
seems Christine DOES pronounce the
final, correct “s” of that possessive,
like any well-spoken gel.) The party is
certainly thrown. It develops into the
sort of debauch familiar to Dolce Vita
audiences. There is a liberal sprink-
ling of call girls, wealthy philanderers
and the occasional homosexual. One
of these provides the film’s most
petulant line when, after Christine
(Miss Buckingham) hurls herself full-
length upon him in front of the others
as he is lying on the floor, she tries to
arouse his dormant male passion.
“You’re generate!” he screams, having
extricated himself from her amorous
clutches, keeping a firm hold on his
unfastened trousers. They play that
bit for laughs.
Tn short, it’s all you might expect in
any Continental film that Britain
has banned for what are obviously
non-political reasons. Sex rears its
unctious and sometimes ugly head in
every major scene, with the exception
of Christine’s only meeting with Mr
Profumo. This happens beside the
pool. Christine, lying flat on her back
and covered with a bath towel, is
approached by a pair of bare legs.
She gazes up at their unseen owner
and tells him she may be contacted
through Dr Ward. Only much later
are we told to whom those legs be-
longed (as if we didn't know). In a
brief inset about the former British
War Minister’s lies to the House, John
Profumo finally gets named. Until
then he is just “someone eemportant”,
to use Eugene Ivanov's words.
Ward, as portrayed by John Barry-
more, is a mild-mannered Svengali
with a liking for Christine and a
penchant for peering through a two-
way mirror at her in bed with Ivanov.
Johnny Edgecombe, the Jamaican, is
seen giving Christine an excellent
lesson in how to get the best results
from smoking marihuana. Peter Rach-
man hovers melodramatically in the
wings, always in dark glasses. How-
ever, Lucky Gordon, Lord Astor,
The Whip Girl, Valerie Profumo, the
so-called Man In The Mask and a
score of others are ignored by “The
Keeler Affair”. Mandy Rice-Davies
is there, of course, but not as the
disarmingly frank young woman we’d
had a sneaking regard for ever since
the Ward trial. Instead, it seems,
Christine regards her sister-in-whore
as just another dull little tart. It’s a
little disillusioning. And one can’t
help wondering if the many omis-
sions and inevitable distortions of
“relevant” events didn’t influence
Britain's censor in banning “The
Keeler Affair,” just as much as the
highly suggestive sex content of most
of the film. (In the 84 minutes that
the Australian censor has left in, the
assertion that Ivanov and Profumo
shared Christine's favors sometimes on
the same day is made repeatedly.
However titillating, this has been
shown to be a lie.)
The film ends soon after the death
of Stephen Ward, with just the briefest
touch on the trial that preceded it.
Then the modulated voice of the real
Christine returns to announce who
played which part. She sounds suit-
ably grateful.
It remains to note only that the
Keeler talent for unfortunate timing
seems to have been passed on to her
film. Its opening in Brisbane (which
was the Australian and British Com-
monwealth premiere) was matched by
just one other notable opening in
town. It was the first day of British
Week.

Excavating Herod’s Palace
Discoveries cast light and generate heat
By Professor YIGAEL YADIN
Masada was perhaps the best-known
unexcavated site of antiquity in
the Holy Land.
It was known to the youth of Israel,
who made it a regular place of pilgrim-
age to commemorate the tragic and
heroic death of its 960 Jewish defenders,
who —before the capture of the fort in
AD 73 by the Roman governor Silva —
preferred to commit suicide rather than
become slaves to their conquerors.
It was known to all those who studied
Roman siegecraft for its uniquely pre-
served Roman camps, siege-wall and
assault ramparts. It was known to
classical archaeologists, for it was here
that Herod the Great built his palaces,
fortifications and store-rooms.
It was also known to all explorers and
travellers who admired this awe-inspir-
ing rock deep in the Judean desert and
overlooking the Dead Sea; its vertical
cliffs and difficult ascent; and the beauti-
ful view from its summit towards Moab
and the Dead Sea in the east, the oasis
of Ein-Gedi in the north, the mountains
of Hebron and Bethlehem in the north-
west, and the Nabataean expanses in
the south.
Schulten, the German scholar who
conducted a brief exploration of the
area in 1932, was moved to write: “One
can envy the future explorer of the
fortress his task, for it is varied and
interesting and the magnificent view is
a reward in itself.”
I have been in this envied position
since the middle of October, 1963, am
I can only say that Schulten understate
the prospect. But beauty of scener
alone would not have been sufficien.
reward for the formidable efforts re-
quired to mount a large-scale archaeo-
logical excavation of Masada; bringing
water, supplies and equipment over long
distances through roadless terrain; pitch-
ing a base camp near Silva’s camp and
having to be satisfied with an inferior site
—he had first choice and he chose well
(using his site would have ruined the
remains of his camp); mobilising hun-
dreds of volunteer workers from all over
the world—for only with the spirit of
the volunteer could one live and excavate
for several months under the severe
conditions we knew we would face.
It was, indeed, because of these
difficulties that Masada, although so well
known, had never been the site of a full-
scale archaeological expedition.
It was the aim of our expedition to
undertake an exhaustive excavation of
all the remains on the 650 by 300 metres
boat - shaped plateau, searching for
archaeological data which could shed
light on the enigmas of its history. Our
efforts in the first months have already
yielded important finds, among them
extremely valuable documents in various
forms, including Biblical scrolls and
scrolls of a sectarian nature. We have
also "been able to clarify the nature of
the architecture, art and stratigraphy of
Masada’s buildings from those of Herod
down to the Byzantine period.
One of the most tantalising —to the
archaeologist buildings erected by
Herod on the summit of the Masada
rock is the three-tiered hanging palace
best described as a palace-villa. It is
built on the very edge of the precipice
and is the only spot on Masada which
enjoys both constant shade and shelter
from the searing desert winds.
The living quarters proper, rooms
built round a courtyard, were on the
upper terrace. This section was in dis-
repair after Herod’s time, when the
Jewish Zealots occupied Masada in
AD 66, and had been destroyed by
them shortly before their suicide in
AD 73.
The centre terrace was for rest and
leisure, boasting a circular pavilion and
a colonnade. The bottom terrace is the
best preserved, and here we discovered
the wall-paintings, still in good con-
dition, which adorned the villa.
Amid the debris of the rooms on this
terrace we found gruesome evidence o
the fate of the Jewish defenders: in the
ashes, coins of the Jewish Revolt agams
the Romans, a letter in Aramaic, a
mantle, arrows and hundreds of silver
plated scales of armor. Lying am° n r
these articles were the skeletal remain

of a man, a woman and a youth. Dark
brown plaits were still attached to the
female scalp. Nearby were her sandals.
Just south of the palace-villa are the
ruins of the famous store-rooms built by
Herod. More than five store-rooms have
been excavated and reconstructed. We
lound scores of jars containing remnants
of food, each being kept in a separate
room. One room contained jars of flour,
another of oil or wine, and so on.
We have cleared two-thirds of the
western palace. Covering an area of one
and a quarter acres, this turns out to
be the main palace of Herod, a palace
in the magnificent sense —a royal resi-
dence complete with throne room,
reception halls, service quarters and
workshops.
It was here that we found beautiful
multi-colored mosaics, which are the
very earliest discovered in this country.
Our greatest surprise—and our most
important discoveries—awaited us in the
fortress casemate wall. When the Zealots
captured Masada in AD 66 they used
the many chambers in the wall as living
quarters for themselves and their
families. We discovered here large
quantities of domestic utensils, as well
as more than 1,000 coins. Unlike the
public buildings, which were burnt com-
P etely, many of these dwellings and their
contents, apparently not considered im-
portant enough to deny to the Romans,
' VCre not fired. And in one of the
c ambers we found our greatest prize
so far scrolls.
The scrolls consisted of fragments of
saints, Leviticus, Genesis and some
apocryphal books. The fact that these
"ere found with articles clearly belong-
JNg to the Zealots, such as coins of the
e 'j'°lt, including 17 silver shekels,
makes these scrolls some of the most
important discovered to this day. For
ere > at last, are Biblical documents
earlier than the year AD 73 whose date
cannot be disputed. With them are more
than 100 inscriptions on shards which
show much of the way of life of the
Zealots.
Among the scroll fragments is one
which is identical with a scroll found
in Qumran cave IV (Qumran is the site
of the Dead Sea sect whose scrolls were
found in the caves in the- 19405). This
particular scroll, consisting of liturgies
associated with —as I believe the
heavenly Sabbath sacrifices, is highly
sectarian, both in its terminology and in
the fact that it is based on the peculiar
Qumranic calendar—a year of 364 days,
12 months each of 30 days, and four
intercalary days. The first day of the
first month in this calendar always falls
on a Wednesday. Now, one of the
chapter headings of our scroll begins:
“The song of the sacrifice of the sixth
Sabbath in the ninth of the second
month.” This corresponds exactly to the
Qumranic calendar.
Resemblances to Christianity
117ith this find—for Dead Sea Scroll
scholarship the most important
Masada find so far—a new and heated
debate has already begun among scholars.
This is because for the first time a Dead
Sea Scroll has been found outside Qum-
ran and in an archaeological stratum and
milieu clearly belonging to a Zealot
stronghold.
The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls
in 1947 produced writings of an
apparently unknown Jewish sect, living
in the later phase of the second Temple,
i.e., about the time of the birth of
Christianity. Moreover, the scrolls re-
vealed, inter alia, that some of the beliefs
and rituals of this sect bore striking
resemblance to what were known to have
been those of the early Christians. To
mention only a few, they called them-
selves the “New Covenant”, or “New
Testament”; they were “the poor”; they
lived together and enjoyed community
of goods; very similar to the early church
of Jerusalem.
The common meal of the sect showed
similarity to the eucharistic feast; their
rites of baptism in many ways resembled
the teachings of John the Baptist. Their
dualism and concept about light and
darkness, life and death, body and spirit,
find many similarities in the writings of
the New Testament, particularly in the
Gospel of John. And yet there are also
basic differences, particularly concern-
ing the concept of the Messianic nature
of the End of the Days, which they
thought was very imminent.
There is no doubt that this was a
pre-Christian Jewish sect. The influence
of this sect on primitive Christianity is
not so difficult to explain. For one thing,
the scene of John the Baptist’s ministry
was in the Wilderness of Judea, more
or less in the very vicinity of the
Qumran. Even Jesus, when he was “led
up of the spirit into the wilderness to be
tempted of the Devil”, may have been
wandering not far away from Qumran.
And Paul, also; he, too, could easily have
contacted the people of Qumran and
learned about their ways.
But whatever were the means or ways
in which this Jewish sect influenced some
of the beliefs of the early Christians, the
main importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls
lies in the fact that for the first time we
have a missing link between what is
called normative Judaism and early
Christianity. It shows that Christianity,

in the beginning, was in fact much more
influenced by Jewish concepts, albeit
sectarian, than had been thought before.
It is only natural, therefore, that the
discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls led
scholars to intense efforts to identify the
Dead Sea sect with any of the known
Jewish sects of the period.
Because of the striking resemblance
between the Dead Sea sect teachings,
ways of life, and location, and those of
the Essenes one of the four main
Jewish sects (the others being the
Pharisees, Sadducees and Zealots) —as
described by Philo, Josephus and Pliny
the Elder, most scholars tend to identify
the Qumran sect with the Essenes. How-
ever, since so little is known of the
actual beliefs of the other divisions,
suggestions were also brought forward to
identify the Scroll sect with the other,
particularly the Zealots. Of the latters’
beliefs we know—from Josephus—that
generally speaking their religious prac-
tices were identical with those of the
Pharisees (a fact which, by the way,
emerges quite clearly also from our finds
in Masada) except for their divergence
on the political-religious concept, i.e.,
that the Zealots, with their zeal for free-
dom, would not recognise any dominion
but that of God. In the latter concept
there was no doubt, in my opinion, some
similarity between them and the Essenes.
Identification with Essenes
"VTow to turn back to Masada. Those
1 who hold that the Qumran sect was
a Zealotian sect will seize upon our
Masada find as confirmation of their
theory. However, there are strong
reasons for the conclusion by most
scholars, with which I tend to agree,
that the Dead Sea Scrolls sect should
be identified with the Essenes. And so
another solution must be sought to
explain our Masada discovery.
The one that commends itself to me
at present is that this scroll reached
Masada with one of the Essene groups
who fought together with the Zealots and
took refuge with them. This theory is
based on the list of area commanders of
the Revolt enumerated by Josephus. One
of them is given as a certain John the
Essene. We can, I believe, conclude
from this that a number of Essenes
joined with other groups of fighters in
the great war of the Jews against the
Romans.
A comprehensive discussion of this
question will be more fruitful after we
publish the material in the appropriate
scientific journal. I am hopeful that such
discussion will produce discerning insight
into the nature of the great Jewish
Revolt, as well as a better understanding
of the Jewish sects in this period, in-
cluding the early Christians, (ofns.)

Songs of Social
Significance
“The surface hardly scratched”
By CHARLES SRIBER
His biographic notes paint a glowing
picture of Howard Keel . . .
“whose husky 6ft 4in, 195
pounds matches a stirring resonance of
a rich baritone voice that won him re-
cognition as one of Hollywood’s most
versatile singers in the remarkably short
space of five years”.
This data, plus the information that
he played football, baseball, basketball
and has a low golf handicap, is no doubt
intended to place him as a singer of the
new, robust, jumping-about school.
However, Keel opened the door of his
hotel suite and greeted me with guarded
politeness, led the way to a settee, settled
his huge frame and began stroking his
beard. He explained the mustachios
and whiskers were an inheritance from
the 90-minute TV version of “Kiss Me
Kate” he had just finished for the BBC.
His last film was “The Big Fisher-
man”, made in 1959. Why none more
recent?
He shrugged: “Because they didn't
go well. Business is slow for me in that
line. I don’t get any offers so I’ve been
playing the theatre, night-clubs and
straight plays. Last thing I did was a
new play by Howard Fast. It was un-
fortunate. We rehearsed two weeks and
played two weeks in Bucks County.
That was a try-out spot, of course, and
we all hoped it would make Broadway,
but . . .” He let his hands fall on his
knees.
Had he any views on social musicals,
such as “West Side Story”? “I feel it
hardly scratched the surface of the
problem. It brushed over the racial
issue. After all, it was just ‘Dead End
Kids’ set to some pretty good music.
“I recently played in Richard Rodgers’
‘No Strings’. Now that got a lot closer
to grips with the racial problem. It
concerns this American in Paris who
meets up with a Negro girl who wants
to make something of him. She tries to
shake him out of himself and be some-
body definite. Sam Taylor wrote the
play and pretty good stuff it was.
“How did they take it? Well, we
opened in Boston and did well. We went
to New York and continued to do good
business. But as we moved further West
it fell off. When we hit the Coast,
Kennedy was assassinated and that
killed the show, too.”


FORUM
Gallipoli, Then...
The facts and the historians
By M. H. ELLIS
To most Australians Anzac was
Gallipoli and C. E. W. Bean’s
official history the adequate report-
ing coverage of the event. But it takes
far more than a reading of Bean’s
detailed and excellent work to under-
stand The Dardanelles campaign and its
dire effects on the progress of the whole
of World War I. Wrapped up in the
story of Anzac are the political intrigues,
the battles of opposing schools of
political amateur strategists, the struggle
between the Western Front command
and the “Near Easterners” for men and
ammunition and priorities, the battle
between the differing schools of thought,
which yet in common saw the vital im-
portance of Aegean campaigns and what
they could achieve by attack on the “soft
underbelly” of Europe, or by opening the
way through The Dardanelles and Sea of
Marmora to supply the weapon-short
Russians, some of whom had not even
sticks to fight with. In this area the
conflict between the giants, Salonika v.
Constantinople, was almost of Olympian
proportions: Lloyd George v. the Rest.
Also, finally, there was the situation
created by the fact that with its troops in
rags and suffering continual massacre,
Russia was demanding in a threatening
bellow that when victory was achieved
Constantinople and The Dardanelles
should become Russian. But for Russia’s
attitude the story of Gallipoli and Anzac
might have been different indeed; for it
was Russia that firmly interdicted the
plan for the use of a Greek army of
150,000 to join in the taking of Istan-
bul. Not one Greek would St Petersburg
allow to set foot in Turkey, even though
all the Greeks desired to do out of
sentimentality was (they said) to be the
first to take communion in St Sophia
before they gracefully retired. So out
went Venizelos and his plan and into
the ascendancy went King Constantine
and his German wife. Greece was
blotted from the Gallipoli picture and
Lemnos became not friendly soil but a
base snatched from an adversary.
Through all the tortuosities of the
complex story of The Dardanelles, there-
fore, the reader of history needs a guide
to show him fairly clearly what is
happening round him, leaving critics?
the apologists and the propagandists and
the contending adversaries to put their
points of view after the events are tabled
in his mind.
For a preliminary bird’s-eye view,
Lieutenant-Colonel Kearsey’s brief en-
cyclopaedia “Notes on the Gallipoli
Campaign” cannot be bettered. It has
everything in tabloid form.
Perhaps Alan Moorehead’s splendid
“Gallipoli” is the best finished study of
the whole picture. It is much more
accurate than most epitomes, but it leaves
much to be explained and the more
intensive student needs other guides.
For historical purposes, The Darda-
nelles venture needs to be studied in three
phases the first, the development of
the application of the Admiralty’s policy
of steady and continuous pressure on a
Mediterranean enemy into a grandiose,
scarcely planned and utterly inadequately
equipped venture for opening the
Bosphorus, arming and aiding the
Russians, commanding the Balkans and
destroying Germany through the back
door by forcing the movement of the
Kaiser’s troops eastward and denuding
the Western Front at the smallest possible
expense.
In this phase it is possible to see
the unorganised state of the political
Supreme Command of the war both in
France and England and the part which
public hysteria played in assuring control
to men utterly unfitted to exercise
authority in positions for which their war
training did not fit them men like
Kitchener and Sir John French.
Kitchener’s wars had been conducted
hitherto against savages, with an admini-
strative headquarters equipment that was
likely to consist of a bundle of telegraph
forms in his hat. It was when he took
the bit in his teeth that the disastrous
drama of the Peninsula land war was
really born.
The best guide to this period—before
studying the period of military prepara-
tion which followed and for which
General Sir lan Hamilton’s “Gallipoli
Diary” is the best tourist’s guide—is the
account of that remarkable South Aus-
tralian-born Marine, Maurice Hankey.
Hankey, between the ages of 18 (when
he joined the Royal Marine Artillery) and
36, rose to the Secretaryship of Balfour’s
Committee of Imperial Defence while
still a major. Clear-sighted and active,
he was confidant of everybody and
much favored by the Prime Minister,
Asquith, who later had sufficient con-
fidence in him when things went wrong
to send him to Gallipoli as his personal
envoy to report confidentially on the
situation.
He had been one of the fathers of the
idea of attacking Gallipoli by land. As
Intelligence Officer to the Mediterranean
Fleet in 1907 he had personally viewed
the Peninsula and The Dardanelles and
formed the opinion that The Narrows
could never be forced by the Navy with-
out military aid, though the Committee
of Imperial Defence had decided early
that year that “the landing of an
expeditionary force on Gallipoli would
entail great risk, and should not be under-
taken in the event of war with Turkey if
other means of pressure were available.”
It was he who wrote the famous “Box-
ing Day Memo” at Christmastime, 1914,
which ranked with Lloyd George’s
Salonika paper, and was so much a
matter of conflict in the next two or
three years. In this essay Hankey set
out possible means, such as the use of
tank-like caterpillar-traction vehicles
and petrol flame-throwers, for breaking
the stalemate on the Western Front. He
presented an alternative scheme for
striking at Germany through Turkey and
the consolidation of the Balkans in the
task of ousting the Sultan for ever from
Europe, and particularly a plan to attack
all German outposts simultaneously and
to divert three army corps from the
French front to be used with Greek and
Bulgarian forces to capture Constan-
tinople.
Hankey’s “The Supreme Command
1914-191 8” (Volume I) was not published
till 1961. Had it been issued much
earlier it might have saved others a lot
of ink and misconception. It might, for
instance, have saved C. E. W. Bean,
the fairest of men but dependent on the
information then available, from writing
the summary of the genesis of The Dar-
danelles campaign which so angered
Churchill: “So through Churchill's excess


of imagination, a layman’s ignorance of
artillery, and the fatal power of a young
enthusiasm to convince older and slower
brains, the tragedy of Gallipoli was
born.”
This, on the dispassionate evidence of
Hankey, writing from the “horse’s
mouth”, must, as Churchill declared in
his “World Crisis”, be labelled as an “in-
accurate, incomplete and prejudiced
judgment which history must reject.”
It is true that Churchill wanted to
attack The Dardanelles out of hand on
the outbreak of war when the Turks were
utterly unprepared. It is true that he
fought tooth and nail for the quick and
sudden attempt to make a naval break-
through which his First Lord, Lord
Fisher, opposed to the last, and almost
to the point of resignation, because he
had in mind a wild scheme for control
of the Baltic. He even had The Darda-
nelles forts bombarded with some effect
on November 3, 1914, and if he had
had his way the Turks would have been
hurried to defeat through naval action
before the Goeben and Breslau had been
allowed to get to shelter in Turkish
waters and the Germans to reorganise
and arm the Gallipoli defences. But
Hankey shows clearly that it was Lord
Kitchener who, in the War Council
meeting of January 8, 1915, pronounced
The Dardanelles a suitable military
objective. Kitchener, however, said
150,000 men with adequate weapons
would be needed, adding that there were
no troops available.
Hankey makes it plain that this medita-
tion started the fires of ambition for the
campaign smouldering. It was the verdict
of Admiral Carden, Naval C-in-C in the
Mediterranean, on January 11—that,
though he could not rush the Straits into
Marmora, he might penetrate them “in
a month about” that set the flame
burning. This especially since Kitchener
commented that he believed the Carden
plan worth trying and that, if it did not
succeed, the Navy could withdraw.
Especially, again, since Sir Edward Grey,
the Foreign Secretary, averred that the
Turks would become “paralysed with
fear” if they saw the forts being destroyed
one by one.
Asquith’s informal conference
TTankey shows that it was Kitchener
who. on February 9, 1915, raised
hopes of a land campaign by saying,
casually, that if the Navy required assist-
ance later on, it would be forthcoming;
and it was Hankey himself who found
this news so welcome that he went to the
Prime Minister, Asquith. It was Asquith
who called the informal conference of
Lloyd George, Grey, Kitchener, Chur-
chill and Fisher which decided to send
the 29th Division to Lemnos if possible
within nine or ten days, and to provide
equipment and landing craft for a force
of 50,000 to attack the Peninsula.
It was Hankey who on March 1 wrote
the paper: “After The Dardanelles: The
Next Step,” following consultation with
the naval and military staffs, and who
circulated it at the most cheerful point
of the negotiations for Russian and
Balkan co-operation, before the Russians
blew the whole plan sky high with their
objection to Greek participation.
Kitchener alone apparently, in secrecy,
decided to vary the plan from one merely
to use troops to make the victory com-
plete after the Navy had done its best,
to one to use the 80,000 men committed
to the task as the substantive attacking
force, with no thought of breaking off
in case of failure.
This decision, as Hankey shows, was
the real genesis of the Gallipoli landing.
No actual decision to use the Army in
the way it was used, was made or
recorded by the War Council. Hankey
himself was so utterly dismayed at the
thought that he wrote to Asquith “im-
ploring him to appoint a Naval and
Military technical committee to plan the
attack in great detail to avoid a repetition
of the Naval disaster”, of which news
had already come to hand. But his memo-
randum was lost in the confusion brought
by the news of the disaster and of Neuve
Chapelle. In any case, Kitchener had
already sent off lan Hamilton —who is
the next key historian to follow sans
staff, sans proper orders, sans informa-
tion, sans everything, on a day’s notice
to conquer Gallipoli what time the
world's Press was giving the enemy day-
to-day news of what was coming.
Hamilton, only a week appointed, had
already steamed down the whole coast-
line of the Peninsula viewing the horrible
marshes at the head of the Gulf of Saros,
the towering menace of Achi Baba, the
cliffs and gullies where Quinn's Post and
Courtney's Post and Lone Pine were
soon to be marked on the map and the
little bight, under the watercourse-scored
cliffs all covered with bushes, which was
soon to be named Anzac Cove.
Everywhere he saw the criss-cross of
huge networks of Turkish defences which
he had been assured in London by
Kitchener were not there. He had finished
an unpleasing day by being hurled into
the midst of The Narrows naval battle—
the greatest action so far in history
between ships and shore “amidst a
world gone mad . . . the elephant and
the whale at it tooth and nail, the whale
getting the worst of it.” He saw the great
Irresistible, the Ocean and the Bouvet
sunk and the Galois aground, the Inflex-
ible limping home and the forts scarcely
touched. It had seemed to him that the
coast between Gaba Tepe and Suvla was
feasible for a landing only “if it were
a calm day and there were no enemy”.
The Sphinx of Khartoum
Tt is a few days earlier than this that
Hamilton takes over the lamp from
Hankey as a main guide to pilot the
historically inquisitive visitor through
the morass of confusion.
The circumstances of his appointment
were enough to explain subsequent
failure, and to make one marvel even at
the degree of success achieved.
Kitchener had abruptly told the War
Council of March 10 that he was sending
Hamilton in command. On the morning
of March 12 he had sent for Hamilton,
whom he had seen every day for months
without mentioning the word Dardanelles,
to him:
“Opening the door I bade him good morn-
ing and walked up to his desk where he sat
writing like a graven image. After a moment
he looked up and said in a matter of fact
tone, “We are sending a military force to
support the fleet at Gallipoli and you are to
have command.”
Then, having uttered “his one tre-
mendous remark”, the Sphinx of Khar-
toum picked up his pen and went on
writing. He behaved as if it had been all
settled as at Pretoria 12 years before.
Then, on even vaguer orders, Hamilton
had gone off to the Western Transvaal
with a buggy, two horses, a mule and an
ADC to beard De La Rey in his den and
fight the final important battle of the
Boer War. Though the General's “know-
ledge of The Dardanelles was nil; of the
Turk nil; of the strength of our forces
nil”, he was supposed, it seemed, to
improvise.
Requests for explanation had led to
the premises that he was to play second
string to the admirals; that the “Cabinet
did not want to hear anything of the
Army till the Fleet sailed through the
straits; that no attack was to be made
until his force was complete and ready,
after which they were to burn their boats,
take Constantinople”, retire and “let the
French and Russians garrison the city
and sing their hymns in St Sophia.” And
so the new C-in-C went off" within a day
without A. or Q. or Medical Staff,
and with a strange Chief of Staff.
The student will be wise to cling to
his hand tightly for the next six weeks
after he goes away from Whitehall with
Kitchener’s answer (“Not one!”) to his

The defeat of the Fleet which he wit-
nessed on March 18 had had a remark-
able effect on the War Council (as Han-
key reported) and convinced it, as Kitch-
ener put it, that the “Army ought to see
the business through . . . there could be
no going back. The publicity of the
announcement has committed us.” It is
around Hamilton in particular that the
six weeks of turmoil centres. In those
weeks were retreat from Lemnos to
Egypt to train and equip his troops, to
sort out the supply ships, to appraise and
get to know new troops, mostly un-
blooded, and to organise the intricate
plans for six separate dawn landings.
Thus Hamilton is the best primary guide.
But after the weary day and night
of April 25, 1915—at the end of which
he was woken from a sleep of exhaustion
to hear tentative proposals to withdraw
troops demoralised with shrapnel and to
give orders to hold on because “you have
only to dig, dig, dig until you are safe”
other guides take over and exhibit
the third phase of the campaign, even
though Hamilton’s diary continues.
Bean’s achievement
Af these, two stand out —men of dif-
ferent types. One is the British official
historian Aspinall-Oglander, whose two
volumes “Gallipoli” in the “British Official
War History” are classics of their kind.
He was a Royal Munster Fusilier who
saw much of the campaign from a box
seat after enduring earlier wars in Ash-
anti, the Mohmand country and South
Africa. He was the officer who was
Chief-of-Staff of the evacuation opera-
tion, mentioned no less than ten times
in despatches and a highly decorated
Brigadier-General at the end of the war.
His is the most valuable, dispassionate
and comprehensive of Gallipoli battle
histories two-sided since the author
has had full recourse to the German
and Turkish viewpoints (as represented,
for instance, in the Fiinf Jti.hre Titrkei
of the German Liman von Sanders, and
the writings of Kannengiesser Pasha and
others w'ho bring out the facts about
the armament, strength and status of
fortifications of the Turks). At the same
t'me, Aspinall-Oglander makes clear what-
niight-have-been, if the attacks had been
a dequately manned and munitioned, in
Passages where he compares Hamilton’s
Krithia attack on a three-mile front of
May 6-8 with 20,000 men and only
1 8,000 rounds of gun ammunition in-
cluding ship-based fire, with Haig's fruit-
'ess contest at Aubers with 30,000 in-
fantry backed by 25,000 reserves and
BO guns in support on a two-mile front,
with shells fired at the rate of 80,000 for
. e a Y- He writes that if Haig had won,
't would have achieved little towards
winning the war, whereas if Haig's two
crowded divisions and his 80,000 rounds
had been available at Krithia they might
have carried Hamilton all the way to
Constantinople.
After digesting Aspinall-Oglander is

collected or personally observed. His
own diaries of four years of war ran to
300 volumes, apart from notes., and he
made it a rule to visit, as far as was
humanly possible, every trench or
position mentioned in his own six
volumes and to make detailed notes on
them. With the exception of Fromelles
and Hermies (in 1917) he was present
on part of the battlefield in every historic
battle in which the AIF played an im-
portant part. And he set his standards
in his report on Gallipoli.
His is the classic description of the
Anzac section of the campaign, our
greatest piece of war reporting, a trench-
to-trench and bush-to-bush and bullet-to-
bullet story which has no equal for its
meticulousness. Yet dealing essentially
in detail, it moulds itself into a mag-
nificent whole and seems to defy imita-
tion, as shown by the lame results of the
efforts to follow his methods of the
army of historians who produced the
story of the Australian effort in World
War 11.
Sometimes on larger issues, on the
politics and strategy of war, he goes
astray through either lack of knowledge
of basic material as yet unrevealed or of
too hastily or cursorily surveying it when
his mind was intent on a main issue of
detail. But this does not topple him
from his throne as the producer of the
great Australian war classic, which
embraces not only the glorious tenacities
and gallantries of Anzac but the whole
of Australia’s achievement in its first
great war.

Around Melbourne
THE EXPLOSIVE VINO DI CARLTON - AND FITZROY
As we have pointed out before, there
was a time when Victoria saw
itself as the future vineyard to the
world, and Melbourne as its glorious,
rosy capital. Alas, that ugly disease,
phylloxera, ruined all. Yes, Mel-
bourne and its environs was good
wine country. There were vineyards
all round Ivanhoe, Caulfield, Whittle-
sea, Sunbury, Geelong, Punt Road,
South Yarra and, believe me, there
were even vineyards by Victoria Park,
now the sacred soil of the Colling-
wood Football Club. Even today
those who are members of the ultra-
select wine clubs occasionally see a
Sunbury hermitage or a Lilydale
riesling taken from a well-guarded
Toorak cellar.
But look, all is not lost; Mel-
bourne’s fame as a wine town has
returned. Mr David Wynn, of
S. Wynn and Co. Pty Ltd, told the
Liquor Royal Commission that Vic-
toria now had 20,000 do-it-yourself
wine families, mostly New Australians,
and they were making a million
gallons of wine a year.
The home-making of wine was
assuming vast proportions, he said,
and it represented a third of the wine
consumed in Victoria. So, instead of
the Lilydale rieslings and the Sunbury
hermitage, we now have il vino di
Carlton, il vino di Fitzroy and the
odd drop of Collingwood chianti.
On your behalf I called on Mr
David Wynn and asked him if he had
tried any of the home vintages, and,
indeed, he had. He said it came
almost invariably in a beer bottle
with a crown seal, and naturally the
home vintner always was splendidly
proud of his product. They were
not the sort of wines that could be
put away, according to David Wynn.
It was best to drink them young, say
about six weeks old. After that they
tended to deteriorate, quietly turning
into vinegar before the end of the
year.
Mr Wynne said that the usual mark
of the home product was a fiery acid
finish. Later I learnt one handy little
tip. Should you be caught in an
inescapable situation where you are
asked to share in a bottle of il vino
di Fitzroy here’s the line . . . “I’m
terribly sorry, I never drink on a
Saint's day. Would you mind if I
took a bottle home and enjoyed it
tomorrow?”
Now, that figure of a million
gallons (6,000,000 bottles) is rather
impressive, particularly when you
consider it has gone up from 600,000
gallons (3,600,000 bottles) last year.
They’re not just figures dreamed up
by Mr Wynn; they come from the
Department of Agriculture, and the
estimates are made from the quantities
of grapes sold at the Victoria Market.
It’s a great pity that the local foot-
crushing season is almost at an end,
for you could visit the market your-
self. There’s a special place at the
market set aside for the winos. Nor
does it merely operate on market
days. It goes six days a week.
There, before dawn, you see hun-
dreds of Italians, Greeks, Maltese,
Australians, too, hollering for their
cases, and it has been reported that
frequently strong men are reduced to
tears when they fail to get their 20
or 30. Largish Italian women are
there, too, to help their husbands
carry the 501 b cases back to the
trucks.
A ll this is matter of much sadness
to the commercial winemakers.
Although we are forbidden to make
our own beer and gin, it is perfectly
legal to make as much wine as we
want as long as we consume it all in
the family, and don’t sell it. And
they’re not a bit shy up at the market.
The average family makes about 300
gallons a year, 1800 bottles. Does
that surprise you? Well, look at it
this way. A good Continental family
likes to get through a couple of
bottles with every meal. The kids
like it. Everybody likes it, and there
are those enthusiasts who will start
the day with a pre-breakfast pick-me-
up of two glasses of wine and two
raw eggs.
There are some who produce their
own grapes. Around Carlton and
Fitzroy you can see houses with
grapevines growing beautifully in and
around the cast-iron of the verandas.
A friend of ours recently moved into
one of these little Carlton wineries.
He found an extraordinary number
of wash-sinks in the laundry. Wash-
sinks are very handy for wine. You
merely crush your grapes and drain
the juice out of the sink hole. In
the pantry the walls were covered
with red splashes, not so much from
the enthusiasm of the drinking; these
came from exploding bottles.
The home winos do not adopt any
over-complicated methods. Some just
crush the grapes with their hands or
their feet in the laundry sink. Some,
more technically-minded, use the
laundry wringer or a small wine press
that has a jack and barrel. They put
the juice, stalks, skins and all in a
44-gallon barrel and let it bubble. It’s
all so simple; nature takes over. No
sugar, no yeast, no preservatives have
to be added. You just have to stand
by patiently for a month until the
brew stops bubbling, then you have
wine, worth all of a shilling a bottle.
Of course, there are other aspects
to this. The Excise people are worried
about the folk who turn their home
wine into grappa, and there are still
plenty of illegal stills around Mel-
bourne which regularly decamp from
site to site with all the speed and
skill of the best two-up schools.
The wine industry is a little baffled
as to what to do about it. Mr Wynn
told the Royal Commission that per-
mits should be issued to those who
wanted to make wine at home, and
there should be a maximum limit for
each member of the family.
But it’s not only wine, don't you
see. We have had cider-makers before
the Commission talking about the
production of cider, perry-makers
talking about the production of pear
m ne.
And that’s one remarkable thing
often overlooked by the temperance
societies; practically everything that
grows, from spuds to crab-apples,
can be turned into alcohol. The truth
is that nature is frightfully opposed
to prohibition.

OVERSEAS
Elections on a
Small Island
A vote of no confidence in France?
By a Special Correspondent
Last January, responsible Govern-
ment in the British sense ceased to
exist in New Caledonia, and the
French Government resumed executive
control Sf the island. The story behind
this drastic move is a fascinating one;
it is a story of graft and mismanage-
ment; of personal ambition and rivalry;
of dynamite; and, romantically, of a
country’s history being changed because
of a crab-fishing expedition and a mid-
night telephone call.
New Caledonia was granted almost
complete internal self-government in
1957. Parliament was elected by uni-
versal suffrage; the Party winning the
majority formed the Government; the
Ministry chosen from this party headed
the executive, and was responsible to
Parliament. Since January last, this
Ministry has ceased to exist. Executive
control now rests in the Governor,
advised by a Council. The member-
ship of this Council is such that effective
control of the Executive is in the hands
of a Governor appointed by France.
In 1958 New Caledonia, like other
French colonies, was given the choice
of complete independence, or of remain-
ing within the French Union. Before
the referendum the French Government,
through the Minister for Overseas Terri-
tories, promised that it would respect the
Constitution of 1957; self-governing
powers might be increased, but under
no circumstances would be decreased.
In December, 1963, the French Govern-
ment, in spite of the opposition of the
New Caledonian Assembly, and of the
majority of the people, abolished the
Constitution of 1957.
Such a possibility was undreamed of
in 1958, and in the rosy glow of their
new internal self-government, the New
Caledonians voted to stay in the French
Union. This was very wise; a small
country of 77,000, closely tied to the
economy of France, and receiving con-
siderable financial and technical aid
from the mother country, would have
been foolish indeed to have cut adrift.
Nevertheless it would be interesting to
see what would be the result of another
plebiscite today.
New Caledonia has approximately
40,000 Melanesians, 30,000 Europeans,
and 8000 Indo-Chinese, Indonesians, etc.
The political parties have from the
beginning represented these divisions.
Not that color has had much effect; one
of the most striking things about the
country is the almost complete absence
of any color bar. But the whites are in
large measure the haves, the colored
people the have-nots. Not surprisingly,
then, the colored people tend to support
the Union Caledonienne, which has a
strong social policy. Since most of the
very considerable social benefits are paid
for by the wealthier whites, they usually
support the opposition parties—the De
Gaullist United New Republican Party,
and the Lafleur Party.
Surprisingly enough, the Melanesians
are almost fanatically faithful in voting,
(it is not compulsory), the whites quite
apathetic. From the beginning, there-
fore, the Union Caledonienne gained
control of the Government. Oddly
enough, both parties are opposed to
income tax, so there is no income tax
in the country, and little likelihood of it
being introduced. This advantage is in
part offset for the employer by the heavy
social services tax —30 per cent of the
wages he pays to his employees. The
employer himself must pay this tax.
Fortunately the danger of a White
Man’s Party and a Black Man's Party
seems to be diminishing. At the last
elections the Union gained quite a lot of
support from the white workers; con-
versely, the Opposition managed to gain
the support of a number of the tribal
chiefs on the East coast. Generally the
natives vote as they are told by their
chiefs.
The question of the efficiency and
honesty of the Government is hotly
debated, and the opponents of the Union
have some rather hair-raising stories.
The French Minister for Overseas
Territories, M. Jaquinot, who was largely
responsible for the • abrogation of the
1957 Constitution, told a sorry tale to
the Chamber of Deputies in Paris. I n
practically every department it was the
same; power used, or rather abused, for
personal or political ends; worse still,
perhaps, inefficiency and slipshod
methods resulting in waste on a grand
scale.
In the State Hospital in Noumea, for
example, no one who belonged to “ a
certain political party” (the Union) paid
anything. Most of the Departments
were quite incapable of keeping any sort
of accounts for money spent, still le sS
of estimating future expenses. Appoint-
ments were largely political; ability
counted for almost nothing.
These charges were, naturally, hotly
denied by the Union. They were, they
maintained, general and unproven. ™
they were true then legal and constitu-


tional means existed for remedying the
situation. The guilty could be punished
in the Courts; Parliament could be dis-
banded and new elections called. The
French Government ignored, or rather
overrode, the strongly expressed opposi-
tion of the New Caledonian Parliament
in destroying the Ministries, and made
no pretence of consulting the people.
They betrayed the pledges given in 1958;
they were trying to return to colonialism.
What truth is there in the accusations
of Jaquinot? Naturally a stranger spend-
ing a couple of months in the country
has limited facilities for finding out
these things—especially things like graft;
one must judge largely from what one
hears, and perhaps sees. Personally I
have little doubt that graft and patronage
existed on a very wide scale—but plenty
of far more sophisticated countries than
New Caledonia have the same problem.
Certainly there is plenty of inefficiency.
It is widespread even in the business
world, as instanced in the price of
locally grown food. Eggs, for example,
cost 12 shillings a dozen produced locally;
it is far cheaper to import eggs from
Australia. When it comes to the public
service this inefficiency is multiplied
many times over.
One of the most eloquent, and best
informed, men that I met was a highly
experienced and qualified French
engineer, who has spent his life in
administration in Madagascar, Indo-
China and other French territories. In
his view the situation is ridiculous, fan-
tastic, impossible, heartbreaking, stupid
. . . As head of the Public Works
Department for a large part of the Island
he is certainly in a position to know
what he is talking about. He estimated
that the working week for the average
native in the Department of Public
Works is 12 to 15 hours. They get
‘‘sick leave” whenever they want to go
home to pick coffee, or fish, or just
have a rest. They knock off work
because it is too wet as soon as a cloud
appears in the sky. Even when work-
ing their pace is so slow that they
accomplish little. There is constant
pressure on the Government officials
irom political sources to take more and
more men on the payroll, irrespective of
whether they are needed or not. A job
means a vote for the man who arranges
it.
jhe crab-fishing expedition
Q n on e occasion I accompanied him
on a trip to inspect some bridges he
was building. “I am building six bridges”
he said bitterly, “they will cost about
12 million francs, and take 12 months
"~if I’m lucky. If I could let them out
for private contract, they would take
three months, and cost four million
francs.”
The leader of the majority party, and
the most influential politician in New
Caledonia, is Maurice Lenormand. His
opponents maintain that Lenormand’s
wealth has increased in direct proportion
to his political power, and has little
reference to the pharmacy he runs. How-
ever, no political graft has ever been
proved against Lenormand personally.
Certainly, he has shown considerable
skill and political acumen in organising
and running his party —for the Union
is largely his creation and his personal
bailiwick. Maurice Lenormand is also
the New Caledonian Deputy to the
National Assembly in France. But the
career of this distinguished politician
looks like coming to an untoward end,
since he is now under sentence of two
months gaol. Not a little of the present
trouble in New Caledonia stems from
this fact. The story is quite a fascinating
one.
Some four years ago Maurice Lenor-
mand began complaining that plots
against his life were being hatched by
his political opponents. As a protec-
tion he arranged for a bodyguard to
watch his house. Most thought the
whole story a political stunt.
Ironically enough, it was a crab-fish-
ing expedition which brought about the
political downfall of Lenormand, and
indeed of the New Caledonian constitu-
tion. Late one night the crab-fishermen
were dividing up their take, down near
the wharves —just outside the Union
Headquarters, when they saw two men
run out of the office. They seemed to
be in a hurry, looking back apprehen-
sively before jumping into their little
Citroen and driving off at full speed.
Shortly afterwards a charge of dynamite
wrecked the Union Office. Unfortunately
for the dynamiters, they were recognised
by the crab-fishermen. Their names
were Ciavaldini and Galaska; the latter
a tough ex-paratrooper who fought in
Israel, and seems to have been some-
thing of a soldier of fortune.
The dynamiters, rather unwisely, drove
straight to Lenormand’s Headquarters,
and the guards saw them in close con-
sultation with Lenormand. At this stage
the telephone rang—it was the police,
to report the outrage to Lenormand. The
timing of this call was to be a crucial
point at the trial, since Lenormand testi-
fied under oath that it had wakened him
from his sleep, and had occurred before
the meeting with the dynamiters. This
was flatly contradicted by Lenormand’s
own guards.
Galaska began by claiming that he
had been hired to do the job by Lenor-
mand, but later he withdrew this state-
ment. Both dynamiters were given
prison sentences. Not unnaturally,
Lenormand was strongly suspected of
having been the moving spirit behind
the dynamiting. Be that as it may, there
was no doubt that he had tried to
suppress evidence at the trial; he was
tried and found guilty on this charge,
being given a suspended sentence. He
made two appeals, the second to the
Court of Appeal in Paris, the equivalent
of the Privy Council. Both appeals
failed.
It was while this affair was at its
most bitter that the French Minister for
Overseas Territories, M. Jaquinot, arrived
last year. The original invitation to
Jaquinot had been made by Lenormand,
but the latter now decided that the Union
should show its displeasure at the treat-
ment its leader had received by a boycott
of the Minister. The boycott was a mis-
take; it embittered the Minister against
Lenormand and the Union, and left the
field to his political opponents. They were
not slow to use their opportunity to
point out the manifold sins and short-
comings of the Union. There is little
doubt that the Minister was greatly
influenced by all of this.
Incompetence, mismanagement
11/’hen Jaquinot returned to France he
moved quickly and decisively. He
made a stinging attack on the incompet-
ence, mismanagement, and venality of
the Government of New Caledonia, and
pushed through a Bill in the Chamber
of Deputies which abolished the minis-
tries. In their place the “Conseil du
Gouvernement” was set up. This was
to consist of five elected members, three
coming from the Union, and two from
the Opposition. In the case of a three-
two split, the Governor has the casting
vote. This means, in practice, that the
Governor will have complete charge of
the Administration.
Supporters of the Union are convinced
that they have been the victims of a
deep-laid plot by an amalgamation of
Big Business and the French Govern-
ment. Big Business in New Caledonia
means the Societe de Nickel. It is cer-
tainly true that “Le Nickel - ’ opposes the
Union, which seems to follow a policy
of mild socialism rather akin to that of
the Australian Labor Party. Indeed the
attitude of many New Caledonians to
the Union is remarkably similar to that
of Australians to the Labor Party. In
each case there are those who are con-
vinced that their socialisation policy is
simply preparing the way for Com-
munism, while others maintain that such
a policy is essential for some degree of
social justice.
The influence of the Nickel company
is enormous. It produces 10 per cent
of the world's nickel, and this represents
the greater part of the income of the
country. While much of this money
finds its way into the pockets of the
Rothschilds and the other shareholders,
much of it reaches the people. The
company employs some 4000 workers,
and pays very good wages. The Nickel


Company exports represent about 96 per
cent of the exports of New Caledonia,
and in 1962 totalled about ten million
pounds; a very considerable sum for a
country of 77,000 people.
There is plenty of evidence of this
wealth, especially in Noumea. There
are an extraordinary number of cars, a
fine shopping centre, busy wharves. The
magnificent harbor is dotted with
picturesque sailing boats and speedboats.
The shockingly high prices seem to
worry the locals but little; indeed most
of the complaints I heard about the
high prices came from French and
foreign officials living on fixed incomes.
Most of the foodstuffs are imported,
Australia supplying the greater part. A
combination of high labor costs, in-
efficient methods, poor land, and small
markets, make it cheaper to buy from
Australia than produce for themselves.
The natives share only in a limited
degree in the prosperity. This is in
part at least their own fault. Many of
them are lazy and unreliable, and this
forced the Nickel Company to import
laborers from elsewhere, especially from
Indo-China and Indonesia. Some natives
work for the Nickel, or for the Public
Works Department, some grow coffee
as a cash crop. But many still live a
primitive life in their villages, subsisting
on yams, manioc, taro, bananas, coco-
nuts, fish, etc. The limited money they
do earn often is spent on alcohol in
spite of the efforts of the Government
to prevent the sale of alcohol to the
natives. Indeed so unsuccessful were
these efforts that in October last, the
restrictions against selling alcohol to the
natives were lifted. This at least would
cut out boot-legging, which was very
widespread, and often quite open.
For those natives prepared to work,
and able to find work, wages are high
—about £ls a week for an unskilled
laborer. The 30 per cent social services
tax paid by the employer was designed
to help the worker, but it has boome-
ranged to some extent, by forcing up
costs, and also by crippling many of the
smaller industries. The natives are also
helped by a generous child endowment
paid by the Government. This is almost
certainly one of the factors which has
led to a greatly increased birth-rate
among the natives.
New elections are to be held this
month (April) in New Caledonia. They
were due in 1966, but the conviction
of Lenormand renders him ineligible to
hold office, and the Assembly has been
dissolved. Since the Union has bitterly
opposed the constitutional changes, and
the Opposition have at least acquiesced
in them, a sweeping victory for the
Union will certainly mean a vote of no
confidence in the French Government,
and a sign of the dissatisfaction of the
people. 1 believe that this will occur.
When a
Miracle
Fails
Italy’s boom bursts ...
From SAMUEL BRITTAN
in Milan
IF anyone is wondering w'hy relations
between Italy and her Common
Market partners have reached an all-
time low, he should take a journey to the
triangular area formed by Genoa, Turin
and Milan. This is the triangle where
the Italian “miracle” was born, and
where the first signs of a rather nasty
recession have now appeared.
Olivetti has had to sack some workers
(an almost unheard of thing in this part
of the world) and people are now
wondering hov long it will be before
Fiat, which has reduced its working
hours, does the same. Out of date pro-
duction figures still being published show
big increases over last year, but workers
at the world-famous sewing machine firm
of Necchi are on a two-day week. The
bottom has fallen out of the building
boom; and investment in plant and
equipment could take a tumble this year.
All this is happening in a country
where the Communists increased their
share of the vote to about 30 per cent
at the last election, and the word revolu-
tion is not yet entirely a joke. Yet the
main advice of the “Six” to Italy has, at
least until recently, been to cut back
still further at home. Professor Hall-
stein, of the Brussels Commission, has
addressed a snooty note to the Italians
asking them why they went to the Ameri-
cans for most of the $lOOO million credit
they recently arranged to see them
through the lira crises and did not go to
the Six instead. The most important
reason in all probability is that they
would have spent much more time argu-
ing and got much less in the end.
A secondary reason is the pro-Ameri-
can feelings of the Nenni Socialists now
in the Government. In Stalin’s time they
supported the Communists; but now they
are devoted to the memory of President
Kennedy one of the quickest volte-
faces that even Roman politics have seen.
The Americans, who are anxious to keep
them that way, arranged the credits with-
out asking too many questions.
The Italian “miracle”, like the German
one before it, was based on a plentiful
supply of cheap labor. Wages actually
rose less than productivity and the great
mass of profit thereby generated was re-
invested in the factories and skyscrapers
which every tourist passing through
Milan notices straightaway. Suddenly
something looking like full employment
has arrived and brought with it a
characteristically exaggerated reaction.
Wages have shot up even more than
prices, and not only are the southern
migrant workers, whose eyes have been
opened to the wealth around them, now
voting Communist, but they are buying
meat twice a week instead of once a
month.
Economically, the crisis is fairly
straightforward. The worrying feature
is the way it is being exploited as part
of a struggle between the Left-Centre
Government in Rome and the big in-
dustrialists and financial interests Some,
but not all, of these, seem to come
straight out of the pages of Marx. Thev
totally reject the diagnosis above and
simply pound the table and shout that
the Government has opened a wav to
Communism and that its very existence
has frightened off savings and invest-
ment.
The Italians now need a period of
time to digest the rapid gains of the
last few years and to adjust their in-
dustries to the new pattern of consumer
demand. They need time for a fresh
attack on the age-old problem of the
South, and the new long-term economic
plans, now in preparation, should at
least remove the more hysterical allega-
tions made on both sides, if only there
is time to discuss it rationally. During
the next few months, too, the Left-
Centre Government will have to find
out whether it has a common language
in which it can talk to the trade unions.

critics have been watching the quiz
shows lately and developing all kinds
of fascinating statistics about them. One
counted the exact number of commercial
plugs Bob Dyer managed to cram into
a half-hour. It was some number short
of 1000. Another “daring, controver-
sial” critic came up with the shattering
information that some of the “Coles’
£3OOO Question - ’ people got their first
£2OO more easily than others. Some-
one else grumbled about Bob Dyer’s
current spelling bee, and another cried
aloud that Roland Strong had steam-
rollered a contestant whose answer had
probably been correct. Who cares?
Certainly not Messrs Dyer, Strong and
their sponsors. Their quiz shows have
lasted for years and may be permanent
fixtures, for two reasons. As Vance
Packard noted recently in a magazine
article, such formula shows can run
forever without the weekly plot varia-
tions that starve out the dramatic series.
And they can do this because they are
based on the everlasting interest in freaks.
In “Pick-A-Box” the freaks are as
filled with that marvellous assortment of
facts misnamed “general knowledge” as
the Tattooed Man’s skin is full of pin-
pricks. In “Coles’ £3OOO Question” the
freakishness of a remarkable memory
is sometimes devoted to useful know'-
ledge. An Albert Einstein could choose
Physics and win the £3OOO. He w'ould
be lucky to last one night on “Pick-A-
Box”, lacking a complete knowledge of
obscure British kings and queens.
Dyer is primarily a showman. He can
sense, though not always exactly,, when
one of his troupe is losing his public
appeal. He can discover likely replace-
ments and build their reputations. And
he has the showman's flair for turning
most attacks on his enterprise into
valuable publicity.
“Coles’ £3OOO Question” lacks show'-
manship. It depends entirely on the
“categories” the contestants choose, how
well they remember, and what luck they
have. Five weeks is the longest any'-
one can appear. The contestants,
moving through at a fast clip, give the
show its appearance of motion while it
is standing still. Its W'orst feature is
the torture chamber in which the £2OO-
- winners have to stand while a
superimposed clock paces out 30 seconds
and a dreadful dirge prevails. It’s close
to sadism.
The latest arrival on the scene, “The
Quiz Kids’’, has neither showmanship
nor the faintest appearance of move-
ment. The old radio show has been
transferred to a television setting which
has all the visual appeal of a mammoth
freshly disinterred from the ice of ages.
And this goes on and on. The Kids
are not smart enough to be freaks. The
only lively features are John Dease’s
when the producer manages to cross him
up in a marvellous variety of ways. And
as he refrains from damning the fellow
in round terms there is not much enter-
tainment in that, either. Unless the
Quiz Kids and their master are given a
new producer, set, format and at least
one Kid with a little showmanship in
his blood, the show seems doomed.
Acquired Taste
Here’s Dawn. Channel 9. Sydney.
JJere s Dawn” is for Dawn Lake en-
thusiasts. For those who respond
to her style of singing and laugh at her
brand of humor it is a complete success.
For those who don’t get a kick out of
standardised gestures, borrowed arrange-
ments and a voice that was not much
better than ordinary five years ago, and
for those who have seen Barry Hum-
phries be a lot funnier at the same thing,
it is just as complete a failure. For Dawn
Lake, like her husband and producer,
Bobby Limb, is an acquired taste. Her
slightly zany personality infects her songs
and sketches and manages to overcome
the lack of imagination that goes into
their production and writing.
In format the show' is as predictably
dull and lifeless as all-Australian tele-
vision variety. The comedy reveals once
again the dearth of good comedy writers
in Australian television.
“Here’s Dawn” is like any number of
its predecessors in the drab history of
variety shows, only the star has changed.
Dawn Lake gives it vigor, energy and
occasional vitality. That it is not quite
enough is her fault only because her
talent is too mediocre to overcome the
mediocrity that is its showcase.

THEATRE
Desire to Please
Bayanihan Philippine Dance Company.
Comedy Theatre. Melbourne.
during the 1950 s as an exten-
sion of the Bayanihan Folk Arts
Centre (a university-supported research
body), this company has toured exten-
sively in recent years, and has now
reached Australia, offering a programme
of “Glimpses of Philippine Culture”.
We have, for example, a number of
“Dances of the Mountain Region”, a
“Muslim Suite,” and a set of “Regional
Variations”. The aim is to inform as
well as entertain, to “project the cultural
identity and artistic image of the Filipino
people”.
The company certainly entertains.
These lively and talented young people
are quite clearly not “the world's most
exciting dancers, singers and musicians”
(an unfortunate programme-note exag-
geration) but they are highly professional
and delightful to watch. Their material
is pleasantly varied, never so exotic as
to be inaccessible, but always interesting
and frequently intriguing. 1 found the
Muslim dances particularly enjoyable—
the last of them, an elaborate piece in-
volving fans, swords and long bamboo
poles, is as colorful and exciting as any-
thing we have seen in Melbourne for
years.
But like most folk-art, these dances
are often diffuse and uneconomical. They
are, no doubt, enjoyable to perform, as
they are to watch, but to a foreigner
they convey only the picturesque surface
of a strange way of life, not anything
fundamental about it. The “image” is
the advertising man’s kind, not the
artist’s. It is too charming to be true
—too wholesome, light and gay. It is a
product not of an intense and profound
vision but of a desire to please.

On opening day this highly pro-
fessional piece of acting still had some
few spots needing a final sand and polish
■—but there was also more than enough
laughter to fill out the rest of the week.
Mr Ron Haddrick, as the hypochondriac

Haddy as his pretty, spiteful spitfire of

a father as one could wish for.
“A Winter’s Tale”—a sad tale’s best
for winter, says the play—is at once one
of Shakespeare’s greatest pieces of
humanity and perhaps the most difficult
of his works to bring off properly. The
great virtue of Mr David Burney’s
presentation at the charming Cell Block
Theatre is that his company, mostly
young aspiring professionals and ad-
vanced students, plays in a modest and
completely consistent style. Because
they do this, the play itself comes
through in a clear, simple light. In this
Mr Burney has achieved something
quite a number of our much more fan-
fared Shakespeare companies have
missed.
The costuming is brilliantly done, per-
haps a little too brilliantly for open
stage, where the effect is immediate and
does not have to carry the great length
of a proscenium theatre. The freely-
adapted “Elizabethan” stage allows a
fine speed and fluidity, so much so that
(with not very extensive cuts) the play
runs two and a half hours or less —re-
markable timing for these days.

Irish Night Out
A Tribute to Brendan Behan. Union
Theatre. Sydney.
tribute paid to Brendan Behan at
the Union Theatre was an irreverent
and slightly chaotic one. The programme
was a pint-pot of individually good per-
formances, but as a production it lacked
any design or coherence, or particular
relevance to Behan himself. On a bare
stage, with a blown-up photograph of
Behan in spotlight, actor Mark McManus
dashed on and off between the folksingers
to steal the show with a reading from
“Borstal Boy” and a scene from “The
Hostage”, Mr James Meagher squeezed
in a few well-chosen words of appraisal,
and even Dave Allen popped up rather
incongruously with a few Irish jokes.
Including a screening of the film of “The
Quare Fellow,” the tribute ran for four
hours, approximately one and a half
hours overtime. It was rather as Behan
might have arranged it himself.
The show was the brainchild and pro-
duction of Irishman Francis Evers, who,
in association with Sydney University
Dramatic Society, found most of the
finance. Hundreds were turned away at
the door. If there was little evidence of
his efforts as a producer, he made his
presence felt on stage. His opening and
closing speeches provided the only touch
of obvious sentiment. Declan Affley and
Brian Mooney sang rebel and drinking
songs. Gary Shearston and Tina Date
provided beautiful harmonised and pol-
ished renditions of Irish lullabies and
famine songs, but their place in a tribute
to Brendan Behan was dubious. Only
Mark McManus’ spirited acting of Be-
han’s prose and plays paid apt compli-
ment to Behan as an artist.
The film, apart from being a bad film
and an irresponsible treatment of the
play, was not a good idea. For Behan
was professionally and in his public pri-


vate life a man of the theatre, and this
was where Evers’ emphases should have
been. If Behan’s life and career were a
long rehearsal for his death, “A Tribute
to Brendan Behan” paid him little hom-
age. It was much more of an Irish night
out —an enjoyable hotchpotch that
should be repeated, but under another
name.

FILMS
Case History
Freud: The Secret Passion. Director,
John Huston. Savoy. Sydney.
This Sporting Life. Director, Lindsay
Anderson. Embassy. Sydney.
You’d think it just about impossible
A to make a dull film about Freud,
but John Huston (of all people) has
managed this dreary feat. Huston is one
of the most vital and stimulating of
directors; films like “The Maltese Fal-
con,” “The Treasure Of Sierra Madre,”
and “The African Queen” are screen
classics, and even in his failures (like
“Moby Dick” or “The Misfits”), though
he may be scatty and annoying, he was
never dull.
The film deals with five of Freud's
early years during which he worked out
his system of psychoanalysis and, by
observation of both his patients and him-
self, formulated his theory of the Oedipus
complex. Huston explains disarmingly
that “we have taken liberties with fact
in order to tell the truth.” This means
that instead of the sheer slogging hard
work and wasted effort through which
Freud, like any scientist, had to battle
to sort out a plethora of facts, the film
shows him presented with them on a
platter by a neurotic young woman with
all the symptoms in the book, who
obligingly dreams such tailor - made
dreams that Blind Freddie could have
interpreted them.
Montgomery Clift's amazingly incom-
petent performance in the central role is,
of course, an insuperable weakness in the
film. His characterisation of Freud con-
sists in wandering somnambulistically
through the_ picture wearing a blank
stare and an astrakhan beard. Most of
the acting is little above amateur
standards: Susannah Yorke as the com-
posite patient has a role far beyond her
capabilities. Eric Portman and Larry
Parks appear (that's the best you can say
for them) as a couple of unlikely medical
men; the most professional work comes
from Rosalie Crutchley and Eileen Herlie,
as the mothers of Freud and the patient
respectively.
The film has been clumsily cut (pre-
sumably in a doomed attempt to liven
things up) but this merely makes it in-
coherent but not any the less pedestrian.
Hypnosis is frequently used in medical
treatment in the film, and Clift and Parks
spend a good part of their time droning:
“Your eyelids are growing heavy ... you
are drifting into sleep.” They don’t
know how near I was to taking them at
their word.
Since David Storey himself worked on
the screen adaptation of his novel, “This
Sporting Life”, we must assume that he
was responsible for —or at least con-
sented in—the shift in emphasis of the
film. The actual incidents of the story
are almost unchanged, but the result is
different and to my mind much less
satisfactory.
Though Storey’s novel is on the surface
the personal history of Frank Machin, a
young miner who attains stardom as a
professional footballer (to him the sum
of human endeavor), it is also a clear
indictment of the whole set-up of profes-
sional sport. Storey does not claim that
pro football is any more dishonest than
any other legitimate big business. He
merely shows how it can destroy its raw
material the young men who happen
to be born with a certain physical
strength and talent by making them
gods for a few years and then un-
emotionally discarding them.
The film, however, concentrates almost
exclusively on the personality of Machin,
a violent, inarticulate man, and his doom-
ed relationship with his widowed land-
lady, a woman so embittered by the death
of her husband that she cannot dare to
involve herself emotionally again. This
of course, is an integral part of the novel,
but it’s by no means the whole story.
Lindsay Anderson deals so sketchily
with the intrigues and plottings of the
team managers who manipulate Machin
like .a pawn on a chessboard that this
aspect of the film is almost meaningless.
Rachel Roberts’ performance as the
widow is so shatteringly good that it
almost manages to hold this incoherent
film together; this is acting in the grand
manner.
Richard Harris is physically convincing
as Machin, but his acting, though profes-
sionally expert, seems to me mannered
and unreal, and (particularly in the later
scenes) he often rants in a manner more
suitable to an opera house.
This is in great part the fault of the
director, who after making some highly
praised documentary shorts has spent
some years in stage direction. Much of
the film shows the theatrical approach—
effects are unduly underlined, the actors
“project” needlessly. What stagey con-
trivance there is in the death scene, with
its absurdly obvious symbol of the black
spider.
At times, especially in the football
sequences, Anderson shows a real feeling
for cinema, but much of the direction is
unnecessarily tricky the complex flash-
backs at the beginning, for instance, seem
to me too clever by half and finally
what remains in the memory is not the
film itself or its direction but Rachel
Roberts’ astonishing power and virtuosity.

/Commercial interests of one sort or
another have long been forcing
jazz (and practically everything else)
into unnatural channels and there is a
constant demand that musicians produce
something new and saleable. Musicians
have, arguably, to live and many are
quick to hop aboard any likely-looking
new bandwagon. Since its creation by
two jazz-influenced Brazilians (Antonio
Carlos Jobim and Joao Gilberto) most
modern jazz groups have tried bossa
nova, many of them merely borrowing
the surface mannerisms.
Bossa nova (meaning “new wrinkle”
or “new approach”) began, not as a
dance, but as a musical style which,
basically, involves the superimposition
of jazz improvisation on a 2/4 samba
beat.
In these albums we have two very
different approaches: Miles Davis uses
bossa nova as a device to express his
own brooding personality while Herbie
Mann adheres closely to the original con-
ception. Also, whereas Mann emphasises
the Brazilian rhythm, Davis and his
arranger rarely do more than imply the
2/4 basis of the music.
There are many who argue that the
flute has no place in jazz, but careful
listening to Herbie Mann should change
all but the most biased opinions. For
him bossa nova (which he claims has
revitalised his musical thinking) demon-
strably means a return to lyricism, grace
and melodic beauty. On “Minha
Saudade” and “One note Samba” by the
originators of the style, and on his own
“B.N. Blues” and “Copacabana”, he
swings gayly and is superbly backed by
guitar, bass, vibraphone and assorted
South American percussion. The popular
“Brazil” begins with a short, almost
satirical, statement of the melody, then
Mann darts off into a puckish, thumb-
nosing dance of delight.
Miles Davis’ “Quiet Nights” is some-
thing of a let-down. Its overall impres-
sion is one of gloom. Considered the
greatest of the cool trumpeters, there are
times when he sounds more like a frozen
cod. Nevertheless, he is highly re-
garded on the contemporary jazz scene
as a sensitive, dedicated artist in spite
of (or perhaps because of) his prima-
donna behavior.

Portrait of a King
By M. H. ELLIS
King Edward VII. Sir Philip Magnus.
John Murray. 50s.
rpHE standard of royal biographies has
certainly improved in the last genera-
tion. The place of the old sycophantic
bowdlerism and the chronique scandal-
euse has been taken by such works as
Harold Nicolson’s “George V”, an
absorbing account of an able and well-
trained British constitutional monarch
engaged in exercising his three rights—
“the right to be consulted, the right to
warn, the right to encourage”; and even
a frank autobiography of Edward VIII.
Now we have Edward VII as limned
by Sir Philip Magnus (Allcroft) who is
eminently fitted for the assignment. A
baronet and occupant of one of the most
famous of thirteenth-century fortified
manors in England (Stokesay Court), the
biographer of Burke, Gladstone and
Raleigh, he has brought an experienced
hand and a balanced historical eye to
bear on an amazingly intimate collection
of documents at his disposal.
These included all the relevant papers
dealing with his subject at Windsor
Castle, which were made available “with
unrestricted access,” by the Queen; the
original papers of the Prince Consort
concerning the young Edward's educa-
tion; the King’s own diary from boy-
hood onwards —short of a few volumes
lost through fire; his remarkable letters
to his son, George, over whom he main-
tained an almost brotherly mentorship
throughout his life and whom he trained
most effectively for Kingship. Also, he
had to his hand a mass of personal and
official correspondence, Cabinet papers,
and the daily reports sent to the King
by the Prime Minister or leader of the
Commons during the period of his
monarchy.
From this huge mass of paper the
author has distilled an attractive and
mostly convincing and well-balanced
picture of an unusual man and an un-
usual king. He has alike resisted the
temptations to stress the sensational, to
gloss over scandal or to magnify or
detract from merit. In fact, he seems
to have set down fairly what came to
his hand without prejudice and without
attempting to give judgment beyond the
bounds of interpretation.
At one stage he remarks in passing on
the similarity between the stories of
Charles II and Edward VII, and it is a
theme which he might have pursued at
some length; for the resemblance in
form and texture between the whole of
their lives as illustrated by Sir Philip
Magnus’s book is astonishing.
Physically, of course, there was no
resemblance, for Charles was one of our
three largest kings like Henry VIII,
six feet four inches tall; while Edward
VII was a little fat man who, in the
prime of his life, boasted a 48-inch
waistline. And Charles was very much
a Scot with an infusion of Latin blood,
who lived in an age in which the word
of the monarch was social law, and the
other very much the Teutonic, in a
world into which Marx and Engels had
been born and in which no monarch or
aspiring prince could live free of the
continual moral surveillance of an eager
Press.
Edward's was the wider world, the
more comfortable and luxurious one.
But otherwise the resemblance between
the circumstances and courses of their
lives ran strikingly parallel, allowing for
progress and the distillation out of the
nineteenth century of a great deal of the
insanitary earthiness which mired the
middle seventeenth.
/Charles spanned the age between the
monarchical absolutism of James the
First and the age of the Bill of Rights,
and Edward VII the age between the
immediate decade after the passage of the
Reform Bill and the era of Lloyd George
and the reform of the House of Lords.
The one endured the civil wars of a mid-
century which robbed him for a long
time of his birthright; the other, the
industrial revolution and the wars of
Empire, each period ending on the brink
of armed conflicts of a magnitude un-
paralleled in earlier times. Each finished
his unpromising career in a splendid and
glittering reign the like of which no man
living had seen, and at the conclusion
of which the first rumblings of constitu-
tional explosions to come where to be
heard underground.
Both began their lives in educational
handcuffs locked on to their minds by
wowserish parents with a burning
ambition to keep them royal; both were
denied from manhood onwards, for
many long years, contact with the
realities of Government, the one through
the death of his father and a poverty-
stricken exile, the other by the jealousy
of a wilful mother, obviously fearing
loss of power in her self-enforced
seclusion.
Thus each educated himself for king-
ship in a most unkingly manner, learn-
ing among common men the facts of
life political and domestic, which kings-
in-training in their respective periods
were denied the right to learn. So each
became much more a human being, with
wide contacts with society and its diver-
sions and politics, than was usual for
monarchs in their times. Each, too. was
more in the public eye and known
intimately to more people than most
princes of their days.
Both loved the ladies, each according
to his kind and age. It might be
chronicled, indeed, as a yardstick by
which to measure the progress of
humanity’s civilisation, and the urbanity
of courts between 1685 and 1910, that
one of Charles’s last deathbed murmurs
was a plea not to let the little drab
“poor Nelly” starve, while one of the
last hands to clasp that of the dying
Edward belonged to the Honorable Mrs
Alice Keppel, who had comforted his
last years, and who was brought to his
bedside by his sorely-tried Queen. (How
much she comforted him seems some-
what problematical, in view of the fact
that she was 29 and beautiful and he was
60 and nearly fifty inches round when
they first met in 1898.)
If King Edward was not nicknamed
Old Persimmon or Old Minoru by the
ribald after he had won the Derby
three times, as King Charles was nick-
named Old Rowley after a famous
stallion, both were great revivers of the
old Norman prairie sport of the Turf —
the “sport of kings”. Charles was the
founder of Newmarket, which was to
him what Epsom and Ascot were to his
nineteenth-century successor, plus the
seventeenth century’s equivalent of the
Edwardian Baden Baden. The name
“Chase-Me-Charlie” survived in the
Stud Book right up to the 19205, though
those favorites “Jack-Come-Tickle-Me”
and “Sweetest-when-Naked” apparently
left no descendants on the English Turf.
Edward, like Charles, was always in
financial trouble till his astute friends
the Rothschilds and Maurice de Hirsch
and Ernest Cassel rescued him, but he
was a very Croesus of the Turf. In
stud money and stakes he earned the
fabulous sum of £415.840 and sold his
Diamond Jubilee, his second Derby
winner, and brother of the famed Per-
simmon, to the Argentine for the then
record sum of £31,500.
Behind all the froth and the gambling,
the ladies and the night running, there
resided in Charles and Edward the
shrewd abilities of two great diplomatists
who sometimes averted war but whose
diplomacy in the end went wrong; two
great builders of the national defences,
especially of the Navy, two great patrons

of scientific advance, the one the father
of the Royal Society and the patron of
Boyle with his steaming kettle, the other
the patron of C. S. Rolls and his motor
car, one of the real fathers of the petrol
age.
Lastly, both again were extraordinary
pickers of men as instruments of their
policy and lives —Charles with his Hyde
and his Bennet, his Tom Killigrew and
his Buckingham; Edward with his
devious Esher and Hardinge of Penshurst
and his “great Xtopher” Sykes and his
kind.
But they were not lucky with their
more ribald poets. Charles had his
Rochester who wrote on his bedroom
door openly:
Here lies our sovereign Lord the King,
Whose promise none relies on;
He never said a foolish thing
Nor ever did a wise one.
Edward, on the other hand, had an
Hilaire Belloc, more rollicking but with-
out access to his bedroom door at Mrs
Willy James’s week ends for her monarch:
A sturdy matron will be set to cope
With Lord , who isn’t “quite the
thing” ,
And give his wife the leisure to elope,
And Mrs James will entertain the
King.
But both were great kings, in great
historical ages of which their lives were
in many ways typical, monarchs of great
change and great advances in standards
of living. And the lives of both make
reading as entrancing as any novel.

Aboriginal Art
Old and New Australian Aboriginal
Art. Roman Black. Angus and
Robertson. 50s.
Black is anxious to promote
Aboriginal art as a commercial pro-
position. In his terms the “old” art is
that of the Aborigines themselves (or at
least of those who still work in tradi-
tional modes—Namatjira and the Aranda
school are not examined); the “new Abo-
riginal art comes from whites, especially
from commercial potters and designers
working, it seems, mostly for the export
market.
You may conclude that this is not an
scholarly work, and you would
e right. The purpose and central thesis
°f the book are mostly nonsense. Granted
1 at if designers want to use Aboriginal
motifs either because they like them (as
‘ argaret Preston did) or because they
nd they sell well, there is no reason why
! , e y shouldn’t succeed artistically; but
« s ? bit strong to hail their efforts as
national art, distinctively Australian in
aracter”. An extreme case, if ever
ere was one, of the reduction of culture
10 geography.
It is even more stupid to attempt to
promote its growth on these grounds. It
is neither customary nor, I think, desir-
able to describe a people’s art in terms
of how commerce can profit from it.
Mr Black, for instance, “cannot help
admiring” carved baobab nuts from the
north-west Kimberleys, and in con-
sequence cannot refrain from suggesting
that the “motifs could be applied per-
fectly to slip-decorated pottery.”
Examples of the “new art”, some
sound, some abominable, are illustrated,
but fortunately it seems that even as
earnest a collector as Mr Black cannot
raise enough acceptable new art to fill
many pages; so, although its presence
hangs like an ochre dust-storm over the
whole work, the “new” section is short.
His treatment of the “old” is that of
an amiable collector. He describes at
considerable length the programmatic
basis of the work he illustrates, and
rarely plunges into aesthetics, anthro-
pology or close documentation. There
is nothing here, as I remember, which
could not be found in Mountford and
others listed in his bibliography.
The black and white illustrations are
profuse, and every one is described in
detail. This is good, but it is no sub-
stitute for a text.
BILL HANNAN
Picasso’s Girl
Picasso and his Friends. Fernande
Olivier. Heinemann. 31s.
At first glance this looks like one of
-*"*• those books, of which there are too
many, that afford the camp followers of
famous men an opportunity of showing
off their insignificant memories. But in
fact la belle Fernande knew Picasso and
his friends as few have known them, and
her recollections were written in the
early ’thirties, slightly before he became
the object of a great cult.
It is a book both sad and illuminating.
Mme Olivier is enough of an artist her-
self —or perhaps she was, for she may
have died since then —to have a more
critical understanding of her lover than
is vouchsafed most women in her
position: she herself studied at the Ecole
des Beaux-Arts with Friesz and Dufy.
Her observations are sharpened by
intelligence (she was one of those French
middle-class girls who in liberating them-
selves from their environment develop
acute analytical powers) and a frosty
sympathy, born of disillusionment. In
these often poignant but always episodic
sketches she remains chiefly the recorder
of incidentals, though of incidentals that
help us to complete the more profound
but vaguer picture drawn by Gertrude
Stein.
When Fernande met Pablo he was
desperately poor; a distraught young
Catalan, intense and suspicious. Appar-
ently he never liked France. They had
to stay in bed for want of a fire, and she
tells a delicious anecdote of how, by
clever stratagem, he managed to obtain
a free meal. Yet she claims, with how
much truth it is impossible to judge,
that Picasso was happier in those days
than he was to be after Kahnwwiler had
made both him and himself rich. “Loyal
companion during the years of hard-
ship, I was not to share the prosperous
years ahead”, she writes. It could be
that this cry from the heart explains
some of the bitterness that occasionally
creeps into her pages.
Certainly, and while always master of
a lucid style, she writes best of the pre-
cubist period before 1908, when they
lived together in Picasso’s slummy studio
in the Rue de Ravignan. This was
when he formed friendships, not devoid
of rivalry, with Guillaume Apollinaire,
Max Jacob and Salmon, the poet, and
with Derain, Matisse, Braque, van
Dongen and that other Spaniard,
Zuloaga, whom fame has treated less

well latterly but who may yet come into
lasting favor.
Of all these men and their women—-
on whom she comments with almost
uniform bitchiness —we get telling
vignettes which, in their modest way,
throw light on their temperaments and
the atmosphere in which they created.
There is a delightful description of
events concerning the dcuanier Rousseau,
whom she considers as naive a being as
he was a painter.
Many will enjoy the book for its
amusing or pathetic close-ups: Apollin-
aire’s duel, his panic at being innocently
entangled, along with Picasso, in the
Louvre robberies; a hashish party in
which poets and painters lay bare their
inner selves; Picasso firing his revolver
in the Place du Tertre half in fun and
half in fury . . . their conclaves in the
Lapin a Gill before it became just
another depressing tourist haunt. All
this adds up to a fairly rounded back-
ground and has the freshness of a
tachiste canvas on a small scale.
Fernande Olivier does little theorising.
But one must be grateful to her for
allowing Picasso’s moody face to emerge
above his milieu. She now thinks that
his work is entirely intellectual, having
once believed that its greatest strength
lay in a deep and despairing love of
humanity. Later, writing of cubism and
subsequent meetings with the futurists,
she seems to contradict herself. “Nothing
abstract or intellectual could move him.”
But in reality there is no contradic-
tion. Picasso, the quintessential intellec-
tual painter, is fascinated by the bull-
ring and by boxers, by Grock and the
clowns of the Cirque Medrano —and, in
the high moment of “Guernica”, intellect
and emotion fuse in genius.
Picasso and his girl met through a
kitten. Whether it was an important
meeting for him we may never know,
but it was for her, and she has paid her
debt to history in an unassumingly
honest volume that is touching because
it has no sentimentality.
DAVID MARTIN
Crime of the
Century
Assassination! The World Stood Still.
John Cottrell. Four Square Books.
ss. 6d.
Tn an author’s note, John Cottrell
abdicates responsibility for anything
but a purely superficial account of the
Kennedy assassination by pleading the
emotion engendered by proximity to the
event. The true significance, the motiva-
tions of the assassin and an evaluation of
the contributory sociological factors are
left by default to more authoritative
works which will follow to examine the
“crime of the century” in the “cold
light of day.”
Cottrell’s own chronicle of the events
of November 22, 1963, is mainly notable
for the speed of production of this
paperback (it was written within 19 days
of the assassination) and for the fact
that the first account in book form is by
an English journalist; but the author’s
plea of an “impossible deadline” is not
a valid excuse for its limitations. His
account amounts to nothing more than
a chronological rehash of the day to day
newspaper coverage; at best it is journa-
listic, anecdotal, w'ritten in a proven
journeyman’s style which thrives on
coincidence.
We learn, for example, that every
American President elected at 20-year
intervals since 1840 either died or was
killed in office, and that four assassina-
tion attempts took place on a Friday;
but there is no examination of James
Reston s thought-provoking comment in
the New York “Times” that “the indict-
ment extended beyond the assassin, for
something in the nation itself, some
strain of madness and violence, had
destroyed the highest symbol of law and
order.”
Perhaps in the cause of Anglo-ES
solidarity, Cottrell adheres strictly to the
official version of the events of the fatal
day. Though he does make passing
reference to some discrepancies, he does
not pursue any of the serious doubts
that have been raised on them, notably by
Berkeley (California) lecturer Mordecai
Brienberg in his examination of the
events (Bulletin, March 21); varying
official statements concerning the type
of gun used; the critical timing of
Oswald's movements, and the angle at
which the bullets entered the President's
body.
In his references to President Kennedy
Cottrell’s attitude is not unlike that of
a preacher called in to eulogise over the
departed, who must avoid any hint of
criticism, and he appears to be measuring
the dead President for a myth com-
parable to that of Lincoln; this adulation
seems to extend to all past US Presidents
as if an assassination attempt were the
surest road to greatness. The use of
the Russian reaction to “epitomise the
grief of the world” really epitomises
nothing but the naivete of the authors
approach.
Accounts of assassination attempts on
other Presidents included in the book
suffer from precisely the same super-
ficiality as that about Kennedy, going no
deeper than contemporary newspaper
accounts. Considering the author’s great
advantage —he had been engaged for
some time on research into assassination
attempts —it is hard to escape the con-
clusion that a big opportunity has been
lost.
Cottrell’s prediction that authoritative
works will follow has already been borne
out by the recent announcement that an
authorised history of President Kennedy*
assassination by William Manchester, the
former President's biographer, is to be
written. Mr Manchester’s estimate that
the work will take from three to
years to complete gives us hope that all
concerned will profit from less haste and
more depth.

From Hardware stores everywhere t.is
recommend “The Honest to God De-
bate”. It will leave the reader in no
doubt whatsoever that Christianity is in
the midst of a revolution of enormous
proportions.
Most of the contributors to this sym-
posium are more or less in sympathy
with the new' movement of thought which
I have called “depth theology”, and
which the editor calls “Christian radi-
calism”. But there is a real debate here
in that some hostile viewpoints are
printed alongside of the friendly ones.
The book consists of twenty-three
reviews of “Honest to God” (including
one by Rudolf Bultmann), eight essays
(stimulating ones by John Robinson,
John Macquarrie and Ruth Robinson;
provocative but uneven ones by Alasdair
Maclntyre and David Jenkins); and ex-
cerpts from fifty of the hundreds of
letters received by “Honest John” (as
he is now being calk J) in response to his
book.
The letters are by far the most inter-
esting part; they reveal a deep dissatis-
faction with present forms of “trad”
Christianity. For example, a vicar’s
wife wrote to Dr Robinson: “You have
made the Church seem alive again, when
for years it has seemed so unbearably
dead!” A public sqhool headmaster
suggested that we must “give up bashing
away at dead images”.
A housewife wrote: “I would not say
that the Church has ‘nothing to lose but
its chains’ but it is peculiarly near to
that”.
One correspondent wrote that because
of the “defunct forms expressing dead
thoughts” he was tortured by church-
going . . . “Each Sunday I wonder whe-
ther I am aiding and indeed being con-
taminated by the paternalistic hypocrisy
which preaches ‘Go forward’, ‘Live by
the Spirit,’ and which itself never budges
from the tired patterns of yesterday’s
pieties”.
Finally, a country vicar wrote: “With
all my heart I know you are right, and
that somehow Christ is struggling free
from the grave clothes of our binding”.
Now that a group of such letters is
in print it will be very hard to deny the
necessity for a reinterpretation of the
Christian faith for a world “come of
age”. Dr Robinson (despite the haziness
°f his book) has shown us the direction
in which the Church will probably move
y*; e -, towards an existentialist Christ-
ianity in which God is not a heavenly
being but is rather a present reality in
the depths of personal relationships.
The Honest to God Debate” is a
significant step forward in the continu-
lng discussion about a religion that seeks
to be relevant to the secular society of
the twentieth century.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Generating More Confidence
I>ecause of its prior knowledge of the £2om. rise in Aus-
tralian trading bank advances for the month of March,
the Reserve Bank moved quickly to dampen any enthusiastic
spending. What might have appeared to be a precipitate
action in a seasonally slack month is now justified by the
publication of official bank figures.
On top of this there has been heavy selling pressure on
short-dated Government securities (or lack of buying support).
This has induced higher interest yields on the open market
and suggests an increase in bond rate.
Thus the investor is given frequent and persistent pointers
of the official policy of the Treasury in setting its face
against inflationary factors before such influences get a chance
to gain strength.
The Stock Exchange has taken notice of the official action
and is proceeding with caution. If the Reserve Bank shows
it is prepared to raise interest rates and restrict lending, it is
obvious it will not make a once-and-for-all gesture but will
keep the subject under strict surveillance. Armed with the
knowledge that the Reserve Bank is on the qui vive to seize
any bold sheep which may spring out of the pen, there is no
justification for investors to believe they can anticipate a
stock market runaway.
Normally, with employment tightening up, high liquidity in
the banking system and extremely buoyant export receipts,
the share market would adopt a most optimistic view. In fact,
it did just that earlier in the year. But the recent call-up of
£lo9m. of trading bank funds into Statutory Reserve Deposits,
plus a positive indication that the flexible interest rate weapon
is now standard equipment in the Treasury arsenal, has kept
the speculators in check.
One important point arises from all this. Despite fears that
imports may quicken, local businessmen could regain some of
the much-needed confidence which was lacking in recent years,
because they have received an official assurance that the
economy will be kept on an even keel and that steady, rather
than spectacular, growth is the order of the day.
A Rise by Any
Other Name
Oy reclassifying its overseas holdings of gold and foreign
exchange at the beginning of April, the Reserve Bank has
added about £64m. to its reserves. The funds were always
there but, by transferring its holdings of overseas securities,
including Treasury bills, to the new omnibus title “gold and
foreign exchange”, an enlarged image is now included in the
front window for everyone to see.
An important point to remember, however, is that this
reclassification must be kept in perspective. Future com-
parisons could be misleading if this £64m. addition is forgotten.
Gold and foreign exchange held by the Reserve. Bank now
appear at the impressive level of £764m’. Add to this the work-
ing balances of the trading banks, and the total of overseas
reserves is well above £Boom.
It is unwise to place too much stress on the strength of
these reserves, because Australia’s balance of payments includes
borrowings and various other vulnerable items. But the
external indications of a nation’s reserves are valuable in
establishing international credit and achieving prestige in trade
circles. The main danger is when imports become too extrava-
gant without proper thought to the build-up of those reserves.
Loans from overseas must be repaid, plus interest, and any
repatriation of investment funds must automatically be lopped
off our reserves.
The structure of liquid assets
The graphs above illustrate the formation and distribution of liquid assets in the Australian financial system
(Source: Reserve Bank Statistical Bulletin, March, 1964). The Reserve Bank last week changed the classification
“gold and balances held abroad” to “gold and foreign exchange” and the move is referred to in an article
above. Monetary policies are further discussed in “Economics Anonymous” on page 53.


More Big Overseas Finance
For Development
T overs of financial expertise are very happy to applaud Rio-
Tinto-Zinc Corporation’s skill in the fixed-interest raisings
for the Gladstone (Queensland) alumina venture. A con-
sortium of American banks has proved willing to lend some
$ll7 million, apparently on an immediate short-term basis.
Finesse will come into its own with later conversion to
longer-term money, presumably when the plant is finished
in three years. For then the US dividend equalisation tax,
adding to the expense of borrowing from America, should,
hopefully, be off the books.
Queensland Alumina Ltd, the construction company, unites
four foreign partners RTZ (through Conzinc Riotinto of
Australia), Kaiser (USA), Alcan (Canada), and Pechiney
(France). The domestic payoff rests in the speedy develop-
ment of Australian resources and a handsome accretion to
overseas reserves.
London money, to the tune of £stglo million, will soon
help RTZ get started on its Hammersley (WA) iron ore project.
Further useful subtleties complete the whole borrowing
scheme, since Japanese steelmakers who take the ore pay
in dollars. The job now is to get the long-term contracts.
Sums of these orders obviously cannot be found in Aus-
tralia. So it won’t be every day that the chairman of
Sydney Stock Exchange may allow himself to praise BHP
and Boral for moves “to ensure continued Australian owner-
ship of certain of our mineral resources”.
Britain’s Expansive Budget Cuts
Demand a Little
T AST week’s British Budget should have produced few real
shocks for close observers of the UK economic scene.
While the more puritanical “experts” were suggesting raising
indirect taxes by approximately £stg2so million, quite a bevy
of commentators seemed to agree that round about £l5O mil-
lion would be a reasonable enough amount.
In actuality the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Reginald
Maudling, decided to plump for a revenue increase of £lO3
million, deriving £lOO million from higher taxes on tobacco
and alcohol. The balance is expected to come from a slightly
wider tax on football pools’ betting.
Heavier taxation covering all forms of betting, frequently
advocated to cure a popular English “disease”, has been
avoided.
Running true to character, Mr Maudling tended to disdain
the offering of any obvious electoral baits in the Budget.
Certainly the Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, appears
to have reached a hurried resolution for an October election
right on top of the final Budget preparations. The Chancel-
lor went on his path unperturbed.
He practically had to, for a very untraditional pre-Budget
statement gave direct notice of “raising substantially increased
sums from the taxpayer”. Mr Maudling was well able to
justify the previous fiscal year’s greater* spending and lower
taxes. “But it must be clearly understood that the picture
this year, with unemployment rapidly falling and the demand
for labor rapidly rising, is an entirely different one,” he
deliberately added.
The 1964-65 budgetary tone again received a precise set-
ting in the Treasury’s Economic Report 1963, published a
week before the Budget speech. It echoed a cheerful British
disposition: “Prosperity was a present fact: but the need for
collective action to avoid inflation and strengthen our compe-
titive position has emerged more clearly than ever before as
the essential condition for the continued achievement of a
satisfactory economic growth.”
Over all the current ebullience of the British economy hangs
the understandable official desire to prevent overheating and
to initiate a long-term guarantee of rational expansion. Some
of last year’s jump in output, incomes and exports plainly
derived from taking up the slack of idle capacity.
Though demand deflation has been practised somewhat
unskilfully in the past, a cutback is called for when demand is
rising 5i p.c. a year while production capacity can only gain
4 p.c. Incidentally, the National Economic Development
Council also argues for that productive target.
Mr Maudling sounds willing to take his stand on a full
deficit at nearly £BOO million (including £67 million surplus
on “above the line” items). He openly risks temporary balance-
of-payments difficulties, sustained by healthy first and second
line reserves.
Sound sterling and Stock Exchange gains probably fortify
the Chancellor in his aims. He must, however, achieve an
accepted incomes policy and also face the possibility of
having to use a more sensitive purchase tax “regulator”.
Skilled Labor Shortage
Gets Attention
At long last the Federal Government has made a promising
reference to plans for tackling the acute shortage of skilled
industrial labor. The Minister for Labor, Mr W. McMahon,
permitted himself the disclosure that his department was
devoting deep thought to adult training schemes.
Still another report must be completed, though, before the
coping stone can be placed on all this arduous ratiocination.
Mr McMahon is held up by the Australian Universities Com-
mission survey of technical education. He should increasingly
realise that the pace needs to be hastened when the required
data comes to hand.
Up till now, apparently, metal and electrical trades have
somehow gained priority in training and retraining schemes.
Building and construction have lately pushed up a consider-
able backlog of vacancies, while printing is also demanding
more skilled workers.
The printing trades employers continue to talk of being
stifled by a growing manpower shortage and press for re-
examination of the whole apprenticeship question. Some
changes have already been effected throughout the building
trades, though these have proved far from sufficient.
Now an extreme tightness in the local employment situation,
leaving mainly a residue of unskilled workers, forces the
Government to talk of resurrecting some highly successful
wartime training schemes. Once more, though, implementation
must wait upon a string of conferences involving unions and
employers.
These will take place against a backcloth of labor-hungry
enterprises like BHP, and even the Public Service, exploring
overseas.
None would gainsay the urgency of the situation, especially
as Australia’s industrial development could be checked in an
economic climate calling for more and more technological
aptitudes.
It might pay the Government not to forget the notion of a
crash programme advocated some time ago by the ANZ
Bank. Among other things, this involved an all-the-year-
round use of existing training facilities (schools, colleges,
etc.) in order to give school-leavers an early baptism into the
kind of skills needed by their future industrial employment


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Monetary Policy at Crossroads
“Rather disturbing picture' 9
Tn what Mr James Robinson described
in the Arbitration Commission the
other day as the current “tinderbox”
liquidity situation, the monetary authori-
ties could be excused for taking unor-
thodox measures to ensure not so much
that the economy was unaffected by it
but that the optimum effects were
obtained.
There is a vital difference here in that
while one of the effects of completely
neutralising the influence of excess liquid-
ity on the economy would be to allow
the rate of interest to move independently
of the excess layers of liquidity, there
could well be some advantages for the
economy in allowing the excess to exert
some influence on the rate of interest.
Needless to say, in current conditions
of labor shortages, the area for
manoeuvre available to the authorities is
very limited, insofar as any further re-
ductions in interest rates would have the
effect of bolstering investment expecta-
tions, which, in turn, would exacerbate
labor shortages in the basic industries.
There is not much doubt that this labor
shortage in investment goods industries
rather than any shortfall in other re-
sources is the critical factor in deciding
how far the economy can afford any fur-
ther pressure of high liquidity on the
rate of interest.
The Reserve Bank seems to be well
abreast of the position. Its latest action
in increasing the interest rate on trading
bank deposits without immediately per-
mitting the trading banks to increase in-
terest rates on advances betokens recog-
nition that, for the time being, there
should at least be a halt to the process
of stimulating private investment.
is not necessarily to say that even
with the bank’s lending facilities al-
ready squeezed by the call-ups to special
deposits this can be done simply by trying
to coax current deposits into fixed de-
posits by offering a higher rate of inter-
est on the latter.
The Reserve Bank appears to be well
aware of this, because since the move it
has also been selling bonds heavily in an
effort to reduce liquidity still further.
Indeed, possibly before this article is in
Print there could well be further mea-
sures to tighten up liquidity, so to reduce
the pressure of the excess on commercial
rates.
Even if the main danger might seem
1° lie in fixed (long-term) investment
being pushed ahead too rapidly for the
labor resources available, thus far in the
Reserve Bank’s attempts to mop up
liquidity the effort is being concentrated
on the tightening of short-term rather
than long-term money.
This is seen not only in the increase
in trading bank deposit rates but also
in the new facilities afforded to the tra-
ding banks to take short-term deposits,
a move designed both to stop the short-
circuiting of bank loans by inter-company
borrowers and to make the Reserve
Bank’s control over the credit situation
more effective.
Fogically, however, the overall design,
starting with the call-ups to SDR, would
seem to be directed to minimising the
activisation of deposits, not so much in
short-term investment as in rather
longer term channels, where commercial
rates are now very favorable to bor-
rowers and where fixed rather than
working capital is involved.
trouble here is that, through the
A trading banks at any rate, the Reserve
Bank has no short cut to these longer
term interest rates which have most bear-
ing on the high current rate of private
investment, and it will be interesting to
see whether its open market operations
on the shorts are extended to the longs,
and if, through the special term lending
funds of the trading banks, it contrives
to cut back this longer term investment.
Equally, if this longer term investment
is the real problem it would be rational
also for the Federal Government to re-
duce its own capital expenditure, for, as
Mr Leslie Atkinson said in his presiden-
tial address to the Associated Chambers
of Commerce conference in Melbourne
recently, “budgetary and monetary
policy must not run in opposite direc-
tions and if it is necessary to tighten
monetary policy, a check should also be
applied on public expenditure.”
It is conceivable, of course, that the
Reserve Bank thinks the economy is on
the eve of a significant increase in the
activisation of deposits all along the line,
not only through the whole scale of
investment but also for consumption
purposes, presupposing the long-awaited
increase in the propensity to spend. The
authorities may think that their luck in
having a restrained velocity of circula-
tion and caution in consumer spending
on their side is too good to last.
On that reasoning the policy of opera-
ting on the quantity of money by get-
ting out of sight as big a proportion of
trading bank current deposits as possible,
either tucked away in SDR or in fixed
deposits in the trading banks, makes
very good sense, whereas the main jus-
tification for attacking interest rates lies
not only in getting in well before a boom
investment psychology pervades the
economy but also in making the price of
money higher and so diminishing the
attraction of higher activation of such
current deposits as left available to the
trading banks.
lnstitute of Public Affairs stated
in its latest review that because of a
much slower velocity of circulation the
big increase in the money supply in
1964 (estimated at 11 p.c. on 1963 com-
pared with rises of 5.1 p.c. in 1959 and
7.7 p.c. in 1960) should not prove nearly
as inflationary as in 1959-60 when heavy
lending by the banks and fringe financial
institutions to business and consumers
brought about a rapid turnover of
money.
“There is a reluctance to borrow for
any but the most sound and worthwhile
purposes,” said the IPA, but, if only
looking at the heralds of speculation in
the building industry, the Reserve Bank
may not be too sure about this.
Equally it may be thinking of the
effects on the velocity of circulation that
may follow a big increase in wages, if
that eventuates from the basic wage
case which terminated last week.
Mr James Robinson painted a rather
disturbing picture of the possibilities in
his final address to the Commission.
Summing up his argument, he said that
an increase in the velocity of circulation
was the immediate effect of an increase
in wages. “It is a reasonable assumption
that wage-earners spend a greater pro-
portion of their income than other sec-
tors, and consequently the total level
of spending will rise if wages rise,” he
said.
Further, “the secondary effect of wage
increases is that businesses require
greater money to finance the labor costs
involved in wage increases, and this leads
to a higher level of bank overdraft and
Government expenditure, both of which
directly expand the money supply.”
Finally Mr Robinson said: “If wage
increases exceed increases in output of
goods and services, the expectation that
prices will rise the fact is that prices
do rise leads to an inflationary situ-
ation. People expect prices to rise, and
businesses and individuals endeavour to
purchase goods before the prices get
higher.”

MARKET POINTERS
Restraints on Enthusiasm
llTith short-term interest rates rising
"* and a general policy of higher rates
for fixed deposits, the share market has
not been encouraged to rise un-
restrainedly.
Talk of higher interest rates on
savings bank deposits and bank over-
drafts also point the way to tighter
money.
Yet there is no doubt the economy is
achieving steady progress, with latest
employment figures giving a warning on
the problems of full employment.
There are some hurdles to surmount,
including the prospect of a substantial
lift in wage rates but, with rising bank
advances, there is justification for expect-
ing further buoyancy in industry.
★ ★ ★
Takeovers (Swallow & Ariell) and
bonus issues (National Consolidated)
are presenting sweet plums for investors,
thus emphasising the advantages of
equities over fixed interest stocks.
A stock which has been moving up in
the market and causing some speculation
is WINCHCOMBE CARSON, which has
an assets backing of 435. 9d. per 20s.
share. The shares slipped down to 265.
recently, but not for long, and investors
have been asking if the improved interim
dividend of 4 p.c. is the only reason for
recent buying interest.
★ ★ ★
mining market has shown some
sharp advances in recent months
and some of the rutile shares are
currently receiving renewed attention.
WYONG MINERALS in particular has
enjoyed a steady rise and has gone up
in quick order to 16s. compared with
13s. a few weeks ago. A rapid jump
like that indicates strong hopes by some-
one.

pOLLOwiNG the MARY KATHLEEN
URANIUM report that it would pay
only one more dividend of 3s. 6d. out
°f profits earned from its £4om. contract
with the UK Atomic Energy Com-
tnission, directors outlined a fairly bleak
waiting period until 1970, when an up-
surge of demand was expected.
But buyers of shares in the associate
company, KATHLEEN INVEST-
MENTS LTD, are not pessimistic.
Kathleen Investments holds a 35 p.c.
investment in MKU, so that each share
ln Kathleen Investments is equal to
C'bout four-sevenths of an MKU share.
The market, prior to the one-for-four
ss. premium issue announcement, as-
sumed that Kathleen Investments could
pay between 3s. and 4s. tax-free to its
own shareholders out of its MKU in-
come this year.
And, in the meantime, the rutile
interests could fill the gap until MKU
reopens its mine. But the 100 p.c.
premium issue came as a shock, fol-
lowed by a forecast of only 25 p.c. divi-
dends on the enlarged capital (Is. 3d.
per ss. share).
An easing in share values, however,
could provide an investment offering tax-
free dividends for at least two years.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Where to Find £8.5 Million?
Grim time ahead for Cox Bros
tpHE interim report from Cox Bros Ltd
A will raise some doubts as to the
company's ability to repay nearly £Bi
million on unsecured deposits and deben-
tures which mature during 1964-65.
The half-year turned in a loss of
£338,000. This compares with £175,000
lost in the full 1962-63 year and a profit
of £686,000 in 1961-62.
The company almost struck trouble
with nearly £2 million that matured this
year, but was saved by the sale of Foys
(WA) to David Jones. If losses continue,
then more assets must be sold to meet
the maturing loans, but a proportion of
the freeholds are already believed to be
under mortgage.
Probably one of the biggest causes of
the half-yearly loss was the £354,000
allowed in discounts to shareholders.
However, directors might be rather
foolish in removing this as many share-
holders apparently shop in Cox stores
only for the discount.
On this figure, w'hich represents a 10
p.c. reduction, £3,540,000 of sales must
have been made to these people. This
represents about 22 p.c. of the £16.2
million total sales in the half-year.
It is pretty obvious that the accounts
could not stand too much of a sales
drop, but it is hard to ascertain exactly
what effect a discount elimination would
have. Some shareholders would consider
the discount as a sort of dividend.
To add to this already gloomy picture
is the sad prospect of further losses in
the current half-year. With no Christ-
mas and no Foys (WA) to boost
trading, things could get grirn^
In the interim report, the directors
talked very blandly about the WA sale
improving liquidity and saving interest.
This is true, but on the other side of
the penny is the fact that Foys is no
longer a member of the group, so
revenue is going to suffer to a consider-
able extent.
Of course, the affiliation with Aus-
tralian United Corporation (chaired by
Sir lan Potter) through the arrangement
that this company has with Cox Finance
(50 p.c. owned by Cox Bros) will un-
doubtedly help things along if the going
gets difficult in 1964-65.
In addition it should not be overly
hard to sell Foys in Melbourne or
Georges in Collins Street. David Jones
and Myers respectively have often been
rumored as interested buyers for these
two establishments.
The Road to Recovery
Ltd, manufacturer of
transport trailers, buses and fork-
lift trucks, is on the road to recovery.
Following a loss of about £530,000 in
1962, £41,000 in 1963, a court case
over inflated stock values, and a board
reorganisation last year, the clouds seem
to be clearing away. *
Last week’s intprim report revealed
a pre-tax profit of £76,210 for the
December term after a 15 p.c. sales
increase to £3 million. Sales in 1962-63
totalled £5 million. This result is in
line with the forecast made by the new
chairman (Mr K. O. Humphreys) in the
last annual report of a 1964 pre-tax
profit in the vicinity of £150,000.
However, shareholders must wait until
at least 1965 before they see a dividend
and probably longer before the 10 p.c.
rate of 1961 is paid again. In that year
profit came out at £150.000 after tax.
The new board decided some time ago
that, in order to strengthen liquidity,
no dividend would be paid this year.
Exactly how strong they intend to make
it is unknown, but the chance of a small
payout to shareholders in 1965 is not
remote.
Bellambi*s Bonanza
expectations are held for Bell-
ambi Coal Co. Ltd, which has just
secured a three-year contract with
Japanese steel mills and chemical com-
panies.
The contract calls for production at
double the rate of the last Japanese
contract, which was for 410,000 tons in
two years to April 1, 1964,
The new contract for 1.25 million tons
should project earning rate (last year
14.5 p.c. on enlarged capital) to unpre-
cedented levels.
At 13s. 9d. the ss. shares, yielding
3.6 p.c., have scope for appreciation.
A Tree Flow of Facta
ThiE shareholders of Frozen Food fn-
dustries have again been put in the
enviable position of knowing exactly how
their company is faring. Last week’s

Through CABIC the Copper and Brass Information
Centre the Copper Industry provides a free service
to Australian manufacturers and technologists to assist
them in the most economic uses of copper and its
alloys.
Product development and continuous scientific
research into the applications and physical properties
of these metals is now a world-wide project, supported
by virtually all the copper producing countries of the
Free World.
Since its formation in June, 1961, the Copper and
Brass Information Centre has supplied technical
information and practical assistance to industry and the
trades. In addition to an active field service, CABIC
offers the facilities of a technical library, a film library
and free literature on many subjects relating to the
industrial and domestic uses of copper.
The advice and help of a technically qualified staff
with many years of practical experience are available to
all those who share in some way our interest in the
development of the Australian copper industry an
industry which is currently contributing in excess of
£15,000,000 to Australia's export income,

detailed figures for profit, earning rate,
sales, tax provision and depreciation on
a nine-month basis as well as for the
quarter.
Things seem to be going pretty well.
In 1962-63 before public listing, earnings
equalled 15.6 p.c. and the prospectus
predicted dividends of 9 p.c. To date,
profit is running at a 19.6 p.c. rate, an
interim dividend of five p.c. has been
declared, and sales have jumped sub-
stantially from £366,000 to £588,000 —
about 60 p.c.
The ss. shares are currently worth
around 10s. 6d. on the market and yield
4.8 p.c. from the dividend. This is a
reasonable income return but, more im-
portantly, there are good prospects for a
dividend increase with such a healthy
earning rate, and the possibility of capital
gain on a medium-term basis is strong.
The group operates in all States and
New Guinea through 15 subsidiaries.
Activities extend from operating self-
service ice stations, to manufacturing
snack foods (mainly frozen) and distri-
buting Cottees frozen foods in Victoria
where everything is centred. Probably
one of its best known brands is “Chiko”.
Exporting also enters the picture in a
minor way—a meat boning plant pro-
cesses meat for this purpose.
Grace Bros’ Service Circle
race Bros has proved a good fairy
to the A. J. Benjamin group (in re-
ceivership) by purchasing the stock, lease
and plant of the Benjamin Top Ryde
store.
This acquisition gives the thriving
Grace Bros a complete circle of shops
from Brookvale to Chatswood, Top Ryde,
Parramatta, Broadway and Bondi
Junction.
The ss. shares of Grace Bros are
currently bringing 225. 6d. (yielding 2.8
p.c.) which compares with this year’s
peak of 235. sd. and last year’s of 235.
They are worth watching for some
temporary weakness to allow cheaper
entry.
Kathleen’s New Appeal
one - for - four premium issue
planned by Kathleen Investments
(Australia) Ltd is evidence of its vigor,
despite the shut-down of the Mary Kath-
leen Uranium mine.
And Kathleen is far from done with
uranium. MKU still has £13.9 million
which can be distributed tax free to
shareholders provided profits from future
operations “become available to that
extent”.
Kathleen has also bought the remain-
ing 51 p.c. of Queensland Mines Ltd
(from Factors) giving it complete owner-
ship of Anderson’s Lode, if contracts

emerge as a major uranium producer.
From a single investment in MKU,
Kathleen is now developing wider in-
terests in other minerals—beach sands,
tin, etc. —with the object of filling the
gap until uranium contracts can be
secured later in the ’6os. The problem is
to maintain a balance between immediate
and long-term profit.
The £474,130 to be raised by the issue
(half of which is premium) will be used
to develop existing projects, primarily,
it appears, the Cable (1956) Ltd ilmenite
plant at Bunbury and the tin deposits at
Marble Bar, both in WA.
A purchase at around 20s. 3d. would
average down to 18s. 2d. after the issue.
On the new dividend rate of 25 p.c., an
investor would obtain an attractive in-
come return of 6.8 p.c.
WcltletTs Bliss
TjV)R medium-term appreciation, Welded
A Products Ltd should prove an interest-
ing and rewarding purchase.
The ss. shares were quoted at 6s. lOd.
buyer, no seller, last sale 75., when news
was released of the issue to E. W. Bliss
Co. of Ohio. This will double paid
capital eventually to £920,000 and bring
in £644,000 cash, including the 2s.
premium per share.
The American capital will finance the
rest of the development programme at
Milperra, and it will be payable in in-
stalments over the next five years.
Welded Products intends to introduce
Bliss products, such as rolling mills and
ancillary equipment for the ferrous and
non-ferrous industries, metal processing
equipment, presses for the metal working
and automotive industries and so on.
The Australian company, engaged in
the production of heavy-duty metal work-
ing machinery, presses, rolls and shears,
welded fabrication, and profile cutting
in steel, has had a rough time these last
two years.
The 12T p.c. dividend was cut back to
8 p.c. for 1962 and 1963 (years to June),
and the last earning rate was 11.1 p.c.
The new shares going to Bliss will not
rank for dividend until 1966-67, giving
Welded a chance to restore earning rate
to respectable levels.
No Growth From Email
A company to exhibit solidity but no
real progress in the last decade is
Email Ltd, electrical equipment complex.
Profit in 1954 was £630,620, in 1963
£609,683, without much variation either
way in the intervening years.
A reorganisation of the company
structure in 1962, changing from a
multiplicity of subsidiaries to divisions,
has apparently not brought any
economies.
The market registered its disappoint-
ment in the 1963 performance (lower
profit after lower provisions) by dropping
the shares from Bs. lid. to Bs. sd. The
yield there is 5.9 p.c., which is only
moderate for what is solely an income
stock
Winterbottom Warming Up
HThe £lOO,OOO expansion programme
proposed by Winterbottom Holdings
is doubtless a necessary step if directors
wish to maintain earnings on paid capital
which jumped substantially from
£450,000 to £675,000 after a one-for-two
bonus last July. At the time, they did
not commit themselves to saying the
10 p.c. dividend would be maintained,
but merely expected that the larger
capital would be “satisfactorily serviced”.
Such a task should not be overly
difficult as the group is increasing its
share of the expanding WA motor in-
dustry. Its main activity is a dealership
for BMC and Chrysler in Perth. Sales
of the vehicles produced by these
organisations have been increasing rapidly
—especially the BMC Morris 1100.
The expansion will be carried out in
all sections of the business. The first
stage has already been finished; at Red-
cliffe, a headquarters has been established
to sell and service Nuffield and Case
tractors and farm machinery. The next
stage involves the complete modernisa-
tion of the facilities for car service and
replacement parts supply.
Conquip Lively
Qydney earthmoving equipment maker
Conquip Ltd gave signs of paying
its highest dividend yet when it an-
nounced an interim pay-out at the annual
rate of 10 p.c. from profit for the
December six months.
This is a splendid recovery from the
4 p.c. paid in the lean year of 1960-61.
Watson’s First Takeovers
Oydney scientific and medical house,
W. Watson and Sons Ltd, has made
its first two takeovers. They are Medical
Instrument Co. Pty and E. A. Kemp
Pty, both Sydney firms in allied fields.
Share issues were made in connection
with these transactions, which increased
ordinary capital by £22,500 to £547,470.
W. Watson’s ss. shares currently

establishment expenses of the new ladies’
knitwear section had adversely affected
the overall result. Some sections of the
business maintained trading results
despite higher costs. Sales in the March
quarter improved over the same period
last year, although the turnover for the
half-year was lower.
Shareholders should not give up hope
of a dividend distribution at the end of
the year, although it will almost certainly
be below last year’s full 8 p.c.
National Consol. Bonus
TPhe one-for-five bonus issue of ss.
A shares to be made by National Con-
solidated reflects in part the recovery and
general return to prosperity enjoyed by
the automotive industry. The company
manufactures heat transfer, metal and
automotive parts, distributes bearings,
publishes greeting cards and has a share
in numerous other interests.
It also reflects the confidence directors
have in the immediate future because the
issue ranks for the current year’s final
dividend (expected to be Bd. or 13£ p.c.)
and they expect to maintain the 20 p.c.
dividend on the enlarged capital.
Not that this would be particularly
difficult anyway as earnings last year
equalled 38 p.c. on capital.
The company seems to be in the
position to maintain this earning rate in
the current year on the higher capital
or at least come very close to it. The
interim report said earnings in the
December half-year had risen 14.3 p.c.
and there was every indication that “the
1963 after tax profit of £1,032,671 would
be exceeded in the current year.”
More Life Savers Available
11/Tien Life Savers (A’asia) Ltd con-
” firmed last year’s 16 p.c. dividend
rate with an interim 8 p.c. the ss. shares
were about 2s. below the peak price of
375. 9d. for 1964 to date, and for the
calendar year 1963.
The large parcel of Life Saver shares
formerly held by Macßobertson's (Aust.)
Ltd, which was placed with the public
in February, has improved the supply
position for this admirable stock.
Hudson Still Troubled
market's patience with George
Hudson Holdings Ltd is being put
to the test by the latest news that no
interim dividend will be paid, and pro-
bably no final either for the current
June year.
The marketing of timber and manu-
facturing operations is the main soft
spot.
The ss. shares may slump near last
year's low of 2s. Id.

Financing Development in
South-East Asia
Qouth-East Asia Development Corporation Ltd has
moved smoothly into its investment banking functions,
reporting a not unfavorable profit of £15,892 for the first
year. Launched by Development Finance Corporation, the
company brings together an impressive array of capital pro-
viders from the Asian area, New Zealand, Canada, UK,
USA, France, Belgium. Holland and Germany.
The more purely financial operations of SEADC have
embraced the management of Malayan Unit Trusts Ltd
and an approach towards becoming a house of issue for
companies seeking Malaysian Stock Exchange listing.
Chairman Dato Nik A. Kamil does lay some stress, too,
on success in facilitating joint industrial ventures. So far these
activities have been concentrated on the Malaysian States. It
would be particularly interesting to learn how much Aus-
tralian business has responded to available opportunities.
There can be little doubt that SEADC’s whole bailiwick is
getting ready to take off for the necessary industrial stiffening.
Recent news from Singapore’s Jurong development tells of the
starting of Singapore Galvanising Industries Ltd (to make iron
sheets and ingots). Jurong Shipyard Ltd, and Bridgestone
Malaysia Co. Ltd (to make 126,000 tyres and tubes a year).
The joint partner with local interests in all these efforts
comes from—Japan.
The Japanese are not averse, either, to looking around
Indonesia —getting ready for economic action as the political
revolution sheds its brashness. In a smaller way, Australian
businessmen could be just as enterprising.
AIDA Advocates Overseas
Export Loans
Moting with satisfaction the formation of the Australian
Bankers’ Export Re-finance Corporation Ltd to facilitate
credit for exporters, a move it has been advocating for years,
the Australian Industries Development Association believes it
is equally urgent to implement measures to facilitate loans to
foreign countries to purchase Australian goods.
AIDA points out that such loans are used by most of the
major industrial nations overseas to increase export sales and
also to assist the developing countries.
For instance, Sweden recently lent five million dollars to
Turkey for the purchase of equipment for a new power
station. Germany has made a loan of 8.5 million dollars to
Greece for the purchase from German manufacturers of
machines and machinery for the erection of an aluminium
plant. A similar loan is being negotiated with France. Germany
has also made a loan of 3.75 million dollars to Vietnam for
the establishment of medium-sized industry.
At the present time Australia has ample funds in London
to enable us to undertake such commitments without
embarrassment.
More Australian Car
Components
V/loves by the Commonwealth Government to influence motor
manufacturers to increase the Australian-made content of
vehicles to about 90 p.c. can hardly be called sudden or incon-
sistent. For years the Federal Government has been working
towards this end but appeared to relent considerably when a
general liberalisation of import controls was introduced in 1960.
Imports of automotive parts have jumped sharply in recent
years and the Government began to get worried again when
the rate doubled to £93.8m. in 1962-63 and continued to show
a rising trend after June, 1963.
The Tariff Board last November was told to inquire into the
motor vehicle industry, based on an application by the Federa-
tion of Automotive Products Manufacturers, with particular
emphasis on whether the by-law admission of components for
use as original equipment in vehicles should be discontinued.
Because the Tariff Board inquiry is expected to take two
years, there is good reason for implementing a plan requiring
the use of additional local components. As a major employer
of Australian labor, the motor industry would be better situated
to cushion a setback from the current boom if most supplies
were drawn from local producers.
There is no doubt that mass producers overseas can produce
various parts at a cheaper rate than by setting up a high-cost
project in Australia. But inevitably the day arrives when it
becomes a question of whether a nation can afford to import
large quantities of vehicles and components, as New Zealand
discovered.
Australia’s build-up of local manufacturing activities has
produced intense competition, involving price cutting and more
frequent models ... all to the benefit of the consumer. There-
fore, at this stage, it does not appear the Government would
be encouraging a monopoly by insisting on a larger Australian
content.

Qantas-flown best-sellers absorb the New Zealand market
New Zealand publishers recently flooded Halstead Press of Sydney with orders for best-selling
books. These stocks were required urgently to take advantage of public demand whilst at its
peak. How to send light reading by the ton the fastest possible way? The company promptly
called Qantas to get consignments off by air. One publisher who profited from these extra sales
said, This airlift speaks volumes for Qantas Air Cargo. We’ll be specifying Qantas regularly
in the futuie. This trend to Qantas Air Cargo not only means increased business for Halstead
Press but will also simplify its production planning. If you’d like to create big export
impressions, why not talk things over with Qantas —the international jet airline that knows
Australia’s business best.

Pros and Cons of Ansett’s Expanding Empire
How long will the company’s tax holiday last?
By ROGER RANDERSON
Mr R. M. Ansett would never have
succeeded in building his now mas-
sive group of air, road and tourist
industries without getting creditors as
well as his shareholders to accept quite
considerable' risks, nor without persua-
ding the Commonwealth Government to
make exceptional arrangements for
sharing the duopoly of trunkline opera-
tions with its own airline.
Unorthodox financial methods were
necessary to maintain the 10 p.c. ordi-
nary dividend in the period when Aus-
tralian National Airways, Butler Air
Transport and other acquisitions were
being absorbed, and the entire air fleet
was being modernised.
The latest balance sheet of Ansett
Transport Industries Ltd still contains
remarkable features and raises questions
which are not answered, despite the
wealth of information included in the
company’s attractively presented reports.
At the same time, a review of balance
sheets since 1957 affords evidence of
rising earnings, skilled control and a
steady consolidation of the company’s
position.
ATI has begun to add a television
dominion to its empire, as the owner
of the third Melbourne station, ATV-0,
due to commence operations in August,
and with interests in stations in other
States.
Mr Ansett claims that Austarama
Television Pty Ltd, the subsidiary own-
ing the Melbourne station, will have
the most far-reaching effect on the
future profitability and long-term stabi-
lity ’ of his group of industries.
This may be correct in the long run,
and many of his well-wishers, including
the writer, hope that this optimistic ex-
pectation will eventually be realised.
JJowever, the immediate problem is
the financing of losses during a two
or three years’ period of establishment
and development, judging by the experi-
ence of well-entrenched competitors
which are now being challenged.
If it were not for the hump to be
surmounted in these new television ven-
tures, one could regard prospects for
Maintenance of the 10 p.c. ordinary
ividend as very satisfactory.
An unchanged interim dividend has
een announced, payable on April 30,
and the accompanying report for the
six months ended December 31 reflected
continuance of the improvement in
economic conditions which lifted
revenue considerably in 1962-63.
Ansett Transport Industries, after
charging £3,051,741 for depreciation
and providing only £40,582 for income
tax, showed net profit of £1,269,936 for
the year ended June 29, 1963.
The year’s increase of £201,497 in
stated net profits (or £218,188 if ad-
justments are made for profits on dis-
posal of fixed assets) permitted increases
in provisions and writing-offs after an
unchanged dividend commitment of
£640,423.
The dividend commitments will in-
crease by £124,054 to £764,477 in the
current year, as the result of the one-
for-six par issue allotted to share and
convertible note holders on June 28,
1963.
Revenue in the first half of 1963-64,
however, was £1,857,837 higher at
£17,648,821 than in the first half of the
previous year only £839,000 of the
increase being due to a new source of
revenue from the acquisition of Mac-
Robertson Miller Airlines in May, 1963.
Directors added that continuance of
the 10 p.c. dividend “seems assured with
ample cover for reserves”.
11/fosT outside observers are puzzled by
the long-continued immunity of An-
sett Transport Industries from the pay-
ment of full standard rates of income
tax, despite the charging of amounts of
depreciation which appear to be very
large.
Quarters close to the company have
attributed the company’s low tax pro-
visions to the combined effects of
ANA’s substantial tax losses when it was
taken over in 1957, and the fact that
the company writes off its aircraft over
four years.
They have added that under these
conditions little tax will be paid before
1968, although this date could be
brought forward by increased profitabi-
lity.
Let us subject these statements to a
little critical analysis.
ATI provided an aggregate of
£124,843 for income tax in the five
years 1959 to 1963 inclusive, with
aggregate stated net profits during the
period of £4,610,502.
Rough calculations point to income
tax of the order of £2,972,000 if
standard company rates had been
charged on these earnings.
Have the allowable ANA losses
aggregated £2,847,157 during the
period? It is extremely unlikely. Sub-
stantial operating losses by ANA Pty
Ltd were said to amount to “several
hundreds of thousands of pounds”.
Depreciation provisions by Ansett
Transport Industries Ltd have during
the same five years period assumed the
following splendid proportions:
£
1959 1,432,125
1960 1,976,476
1961 2,587,566
1962 2,589,284
1963 3,051,741
we to infer that the group has
been claiming, and is being allowed,
even greater deductions for deprecia-
tion than these figures indicate?
This is the clear implication of state-
ments already quoted from the quarter
that purports to understand the position.
It is not beyond the bounds of possi-
bility that the Commissioner of Taxa-
tion is showing some consideration to
Ansett under direction from the Federal
Government.
Doubtless, this would receive justifi-
cation on the ground that it is neces-
sary to put Ansett on an equal competi-
tive footing with TAA, which does
seem to be socially desirable.
But other industries may well ask why
they should not be conceded similar
treatment, especially since generous
allowances for rapid depreciation of
fixed assets hold many keys to technical
efficiency and national productivity.
So far as the status of the company’s
shares is concerned, the immediate prac-
tical question is: How much longer will
Ansett Transport Industries be allowed
to operate under such favorable condi-
tions?
Stability in the net figure of “Aircraft,
engines and spares” during the past
three years, despite additions exceeding
£3 million, suggests that the time is
rapidly approaching when amounts to be


written off will decline, thus causing tax
commitments to increase far beyond the
present surplus of earnings after dividend
payments.
Directors have appropriated from pro-
fits the following amounts to establish a
reserve for future income tax:
£
1960 165,323
1961 200,000
1962 250,000
1963 255,873
However, it is not a specific reserve
of readily realisable assets, so that pay-
ment of higher income tax in the future
must still come from earnings.
“Minus working capital”, as shown in
the table below, still seems to me to re-
present undue dependence on borrow-
ings, and to be a weakness in the com-
pany’s finances calling for correction.
A note to the 1962 accounts stated
that this situation is common in a ser-
vice industry, particularly in civil avia-
tion, because revenue arises from ser-
vice given by the Fixed Assets.
“Over the past five years,” the note
added, “this company has purchased 18
aircraft costing about £12,500,000, 30
motor passenger vehicles costing about
£1,000,000 and motor freight vehicles
and trailers costing about £650,000.
Thus a conventional Current Asset to
Current Liability relationship to give
working capital is not applicable.”
proposition is arguable, even
though “minus working capital” may
be shown by some overseas air transport
companies, and even though the argu-
ment might have been placed on a
stronger footing by reference to the
company’s high proportion of cash re-
ceipts for services rendered.
But Ansett- now seems to have lost
confidence in asserting this claim. The
latest balance sheet contains no such
note, and purports to show current
assets exceeding current liabilities by
£3,898,607. However, this effect was
achieved by including £6,071,634 of
liabilities due within one year among
the company’s “Long Term Liabilities”.
One wonders why such matters are
persistently overlooked in the granting
of merit awards for balance sheets.
For the purpose of the table below, I
have had to adjust this, besides detach-
ing “Investments” from “Current
Assets”.
Compared with the difficult transi-
tional year of 1959, ATI has strength-
ened its position by reducing secured
bank overdrafts and loans secured on
properties and aircraft by £4,438,780
from £13,043,568 to £8,604,788.
Unsecured (and unlisted) deposits,
however, have increased by £8,730,515
—from £4,476,087 to £13,206,602.
Overseas borrowing to finance two
Boeing 727, due to be put into service
later this year will increase the com-
pany’s secured debts.
At the same time, a current prospec-
tus seeks £500,000 to £1,500,000 of un-
secured deposits for terms of three to
10 years.
A trust deed limits the aggregate of
all borrowings to six times shareholders’
funds, which is a very high limit for
an industrial enterprise.
An issue of £1,500,000 of 7 p.c. notes
is due to be converted into ordinary
capital in June, 1966.
Funds of share and convertible note
holders now total £11,819,987, com-
pared with £4,444,271 in 1959.
Ansett's duopolistic position under the
1961 Civil Aviation Agreement Act pro-
vides it with a most valuable property,
which must be the envy of private air-
lines in other parts of the world.
For 15 years the company has a
franchise over about half the Australian
air industry’s revenue, which at present
totals about £36 million a year. No
other trunkline competitor can en-
croach for the period on the evenly-
divided preserves of TAA and Ansett-
ANA.
Stability is assured by provisions for
gradual re-equipment into full jet air-
craft by both organisations.
The surprisingly severe attack on
Ansett by the Federal Leader of the
Opposition, however, is a reminder that
the company's present position may be
vulnerable to swings of the political
pendulum.
Investors generally will be encouraged
by the fact that such a sagacious inves-
tor as W. R. Carpenter Holdings and
such a potentially large supplier as
Boral now possess greater interests in
the company than the large holdings of
Mr Ansett himself.
Nevertheless, it is not easy to value
the ordinary shares. The company gives
its earning rate on average capital em-
ployed last year as 20.51 p.c., but this
is extremely debatable when it depends
on payment of negligible income tax
and in the absence of information as to
the period of its “tax holiday”.
While I consider the price of ss. 6d.
was too low last year, the present price
of 9s. Id. to show 5i p.c. dividend
yield seems high enough in view of the
company's immediate problems of
maintaining earnings and reducing de-
pendence on borrowings.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Newsprint Company’s Growth
Tasman Pulp and Paper exports exceed £NZ40m.
Ojnce Tasman Pulp and Paper Co.
Ltd began operations in 1955, it
has been responsible for export earnings
of over £NZ4O million, and import
savings of £NZI9.S million to New
Zealand.
The company has become New
Zealand's largest exporter of manu-
factured goods, supplying over 40 p.c.
of total NZ exports to Australia.
Tasman is officially described as
mainly an export enterprise, selling two-
thirds of its newsprint and pulp output
overseas, and one-fifth of its timber
production. Australia is the largest
customer.
The NZ Government has provided
loan money over the years, £NZI million
of which is being converted to par-
ticipating preference shares. It also
holds 2.2 million 20s. ordinary shares.
Break-up of the £NZ9.7 million ordin-
ary share ownership is: NZ Government,
32.7 p.c.; Bowater Paper Corporation
Ltd of London, 17.0 p.c.; The Fletcher
Trust and Investment Co. Ltd, 11.3 p.c.;
Australian Newsprint Mills Holdings
Ltd, 20.6 p.c.; and public shareholders
the balance.
It was 1954 when Tasman sought
public subscription to 500,000 20s.
ordinary shares (at par) and £2 million
in 5 p.c. debentures.
The enterprise was originally spon-
sored by the Fletcher Trust and the NZ
Government to commercially develop
the Kaingaroa forest of exotic conifers
on the north island of NZ. This was
the largest man-made forest in NZ and
the growth rate of the pine and fir trees
was considerably greater than similar
forests in northern countries.
Recommendations were made by
Canadian consulting engineers to con-
struct an integrated plant producing
annually 75,000 long tons of newsprint,
36,800 long tons of sulphate pulp for
sale and 72 million board feet of sawn
timber.
In the year to October 31, 1963,
newsprint production at 160,000 tons
was nearly double that of the previous
year, thanks to the successful start-up of
a second newsprint machine. Output of
sulphate pulp for sale rose by 7000
tons, but more had to be directed to the
Production of newsprint, so the quantity
available for sale fell from 51,563 to
37,805 tons. Sawn timber output has
never been as great as originally
envisaged, and in the last two years has
declined from 56 million board feet to
48 million board feet, largely due to
depressed conditions in the Australian
building industry.
Since inception, Tasman has invested
£43 million in plant and machinery,
buildings, employee housing, forest de-
velopment, working capital and in
acquiring shares in Australian News-
print Mills.
This acquisition was a 1963 arrange-
ment to exchange two million ordinary
shares with ANM, reciprocal board
representation, and the achievement of
‘‘orderly development in the manu-
facture and distribution of newsprint in
Australia and New Zealand”.
The investment in ANM is shown in
Tasman’s accounts as “at cost £2.7
million”.
Each company made a one-for-ten
bonus. The issue by Tasman to ANM
was at a premium of 7s. per share,
creating a share premium account of
£700,000 from which the bonus was
made.
The partnership envisages a rapid
growth in Tasman’s newsprint output to
250,000 tons a year by 1965, it is
believed.
Heavy borrowings carry commen-
surate interest burdens. In 1962-63
term liabilities amounted to £lB.B
million, compared with paid capital at
balance date of £9.7 million.
Total interest charges rose by
£545,000 to £1,055,200 in the year to
October 31, 1963, while depreciation
charges rose by £981,000 to £2,222,300.
These increases were entirely due to the
major capital investment in the second
newsprint mill and related plant, and
were the causes of the profit fall.
The net profit actually receded from
£979,376 to £670,368, although sales
had expanded by 41 p.c. Tax liability
was still nominal.
Special depreciation of £654,883 was
allowed by the Minister of Finance in
calculating the provision for tax,
although it was not written off in the
company’s accounts.
A maiden dividend of 5 p.c. was paid,
absorbing £385,000. Presumably, now
that reciprocal agreement has been made
with ANM, every effort will be made to
keep on the dividend lists, although
ANM did not participate in Tasman’s
first dividend, nor did it pay anything
to Tasman in 1962-63.
During most of the company’s history
Tasman has operated in a situation of
world over-supply of newsprint. News-
print and pulp prices are lower than
they were in 1955, so the company has
battled to contain costs by increasing
production from original plant, by
generally greater efficiencies, introduc-
tion of technological improvements, and
lastly by a major plant extension costing
about £12 million.
Canadian newsprint delivered to Aus-
tralia has recently declined in price, but
Tasman directors believe they can meet
this changing situation with their new
plant. Demand for sawn timber from
Australia is on the up-grade.
Directors make no promises about
this year’s profits. New plant will be
productive for the full year, but heavy
charges for interest and depreciation will
continue. And, of course, this year there
will be preference charges before ordin-
ary shareholders receive anything.
Emphasis will be placed on increasing
volume and efficiency from existing
plant, and some time will elapse before
the second newsprint machine is working
at optimum capacity.
The shares are not listed on Aus-
tralian Exchanges. Forest products and
paper will be well in the frontline of the
proposed Australian-New Zealand Cus-
toms Union.

JEFFRIES INDUSTRIES LTD
Seeking Takeover Prospects
Teffrif.s Industries Ltd of Artarmon
** (NSW) is still looking for opportun-
ities for takeover. The chairman (Mr
R. E. Jeffries) told shareholders at the
March annual meeting that several, in-
vestigations had already been made but
all finally rejected.
The company, whose business was
founded by the chairman in 1932,
operates as engineering and electrical
manufacturers and merchants.
Existing activities include pneumatic
and hydraulic production equipment,
automation equipment, electrical insula-
tion, power supply equipment (insulators
and switchgear), portable pneumatic and
electric power tools, controls for auto-
matic equipment, commercial and
domestic electrical appliances and
electroplating.
Customers are all branches of in-
dustry, government departments and
public authorities.
Since 1947, Jeffries has had a 49 p.c.
interest in Morphy Richards (Australia)
Pty Ltd, which distributes Morphy
Richards appliances here. (Morphy
Richards of England is a subsidiary of
EMI of England.)
Associations are maintained with over
60 American and British firms, one of
the most important being the manu-
facturing licence and distributing agree-
ment with General Controls Co. of USA.
This was secured in 1960-61 and
prompted extension of the Artarmon
production facilities.
Trading in the year to November 30,
1963, resulted in a net profit of £82,561,
after providing £53,350 for tax, £18,201
for depreciation and £9500 for long-
service leave. There was a loss of
£306 on sale of fixed assets.
Profit compares with £92,613 in
1959-60 (the peak year) and £76,457
in 1961-62.
The 15 p.c. dividend established in
1953-54 is paid once again. Earning
rate improved from 17.8 p.c. to 19.5 p.c.
on unchanged ordinary capital, after
preference charges of £12,000.
Shareholders have had the opportunity
to subscribe to a one-for-two par issue
in September, 1955, a one-for-tw r o note
issue in May, 1959, and a one-for-five
issue at 2s. 6d. premium in May, 1961.
Noteholders rank equally for any cash
issue, and in the event of a bonus con-
vert automatically. Otherwise, maturity
date is February 28, 1965, when ordin-
ary capital will increase by £108,750.
In 1961, £150,000 was raised in 8 p.c.
redeemable preference shares.
A working capital ratio of two-to-one
dismisses the possibility of another
capital issue in the near future.
Group sales are currently running at
a higher level than previously, and
directors feel future prospects are en-
couraging.
An income return of 5.3 p.c. jj
attractive at these times from a com-
pany which has such a solid record
sound growth prospects. Its overseas
relations don't do it any harm in in-
vestors' opinion either.
However, the high pay-out ratio*
means the earnings yield is an unremark-

J. C. LUDOWICI AND SON LTD
Wait on the Earning Rate
TTalf-way through the last financial
year directors of J. C. Ludowici
and Son Ltd saw*that it was going to be
a bumper period and accordingly they
announced a one-for-two bonus and a
share split from 20s. to ss. units.
They forecast a dividend of not less
than 1 1 p.c. on the enlarged capital.
Shareholders were not disappointed.
The interim payment before the
bonus was 8* p.c., and the final on the
larger capital was 6\ p.c. The total pay-
out for the year represented 12 p.c. on
the final capital.
This was in effect a 20 p.c. increase
in income for shareholders.
J. C. Ludowici celebrated its centen-
ary in 1958. Its original business ves
leather belting and sole leather. Today
the company makes nylon and plastic
bonded power transmission and conveyor
beltings, packings and seals, and in-
dustrial gloves; it acts as general po' ver
transmission engineers, and distribute
Fla-Seal oil and grease retainers, tubin#
and hose.
Factory and warehouse are located -•
Lane Cove (NSW). There are branches
in Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane.
Properties were revalued in 1956 h
£192,795 and this reserve, since deplete
to £129,182, formed the basis for jhe
recent bonus which capitalised £62.59
The balance of this account is no' 4
£66.682.
In the last three years Ludowici h-S
been selling off investments. The resu l '
ant capital profit has been set aside W
long-term development of new produw
in a provision for commercial develop"
ment. During 1963 £8,193 was spent

year rose from £31,044 to £64,077 after
providing £36,000 (1962, £9,087) for
5 tax and £21,739 (£18,501) for deprecia-
tion. An appropriation of £10,000 from
profits was made for long-service leave
allowances which may be paid in future
in excess of those for which the com-
pany is legally obligated.
Directors described trading con-
ditions as buoyant in 1963. Although
competition is aggressive, they are con-
fident of steady expansion and an in-
creased share of markets.
In issuing the bonus to shareholders
in late October, directors said it was
made in the belief that the company
was soundly based. They explained that
the old dependence on industrial leather
manufacturing had been replaced at a
rapidly accelerating rate by the develop-
ment of synthetic rubber and plastics
fabrication.
As investments are just about
exhausted as a source of funds, the
company must depend more on retained
profits for its development. The present
trend is encouraging, but investors
should not get too carried away. It
might be prudent to wait for evidence
that last year’s excellent earning rate
(31.2 p.c. after preference charges) is
not just a flash in the pan.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Hitting Front-page Headlines
And the shares didn’t go down
TTs not every day that one of your
investments manages to get off the
financial page and move up to the head-
lines. But that’s exactly what did happen
with Ansett, and not only on the day
that the propeller and engine fell off. For
two days later we read that Sir Robert
used the words “filthy question” when
a certain accusation was made in Parlia-
ment about the incident. It sounded as
if he’d stolen the phrase from the “Goon
Show”.
At least the shares didn’t go down and
I’m grateful for that. These days it seems
just a matter of hoping that your shares
don't join the general downtrend. In this
regard the portfolio has had its dis-
appointments in Hanimex and Pioneer
Concrete. Both companies would appear
to be doing very well. This apparently
has little bearing on their price move-
ment. If it was Amalgamated Chemicals,
Lend Lease or Deposit and Investment,
I could understand.
The confusing thing about the present
market is that it is still relatively de-
pressed when viewed against an obviously
prosperous economic background. With
this as my theme, I waded into the pur-
chase of one of the stock market's heavy-
weights— James Hardie, the asbestos
king.
It would be a serious challenger for
the most conservative company on
the Stock Exchange.
Several bonus issues have been made.
Now, for the first time since listing, the
company is to make a par issue on the
basis of l-for-4. At the same time, it
will raise the dividend to 13i p.c. for the
year ended March 31. This is a pretty
fair indication of a record profit for the
year.
The stock market has taken these
developments very quietly, the price of
the shares remaining at about £6 15s.
After buying 100, I'm now hoping that
the stock will be very quickly reassessed.
Following this purchase was a quick
buy on Thursday of 200 Molloy Hold-
ings, a small timber company operating
in Wollongong. Heavy losses in 1962
and 1963 and a record loss for the first
half of the current year have pushed the
company into receivership. Even when
this current loss is deducted from the
book assets backing at June 30, 1963, it
still comes out at a hefty 7s. for every
share. Throw in the tax loss of £200,000
and it doesn’t look a bad proposition for
a takeover. Besides, the marking down
of the share from 2s. to Is. seemed too
much.
On to the final purchase this weekend
and that was R. W. Miller. If “change”
is the motive for success, then this will
be a most successful company.
Initially only a shipping business, the
company moved strongly into the coal
industry and now controls nine collieries.
Then, in 1957, it took over a brewery
at Petersham and thus became the third
major force in beer in New South Wales.
It has since built up a chain of some 20
hotels in the city and metropolitan area.
Now once again the emphasis falls on the
shipping side. It has already purchased
one coastal tanker, plans to import an-
other two and have a further three
tankers built locally.
Miller’s have managed to overcome
the initial opposition by the Government
and the oil companies. This removes
one question mark about the stock. The
other has been the consistent heavy sell-
ing from one source since listing, but
this apparently has almost dried up.
After having sold around 19s. for so
many months, the shares should start
moving forwards shortly. I bought 500.
Selling is always much harder than
buying. To raise the odd £1000, out
went two of the steadier stocks,
O'Donnell Griffin and 500 of the Eric
White. Total profit was £47.
Transactions for the week were:

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Rylah Now as Racket-buster
Clean-up overdue at Victoria Market
~\T ictoria’s Chief Secretary, Mr Arthur
y Rylah, doing rather well in the eyes
of the mothers of some teenage daughters
in the furore over the banning of “The
Group”, has done it again. This time
he is to import a “racket-buster from
the FBI” to help Victoria’s police force
to clean up “protection rackets”.
Although he avoided saying specifically
that the protection rackets are to be
found in the fruit and vegetable business
at the Victoria Market, everyone knows
that’s where the rackets are.
There is no doubt the Victoria Mar-
ket needs a clean-up —or, much more
to the point, the whole system of mar-
keting of which the Victoria Market
and similar markets everywhere are but
a part.
So far, the approach to the problem
has been a classic example of treating the
symptoms and not the cause.
In true Eliot Ness style the police
recently set up “road blocks” on two of
the main arteries leading into Melbourne.
Trucks bound for the markets in the
early hours were stopped and searched.
Even a wizened Chinese market gar-
dener driving a horse and waggon a
relic of former days was apprehended.
This at least proved that there is still
one Chinese market gardener in business.
The great majority given the once-over,
however, were naturally Italians.
Italian community inevitably is
associated with anything to do with
fruit and vegetables these days. In fact,
the market gardeners may be Greeks,
Cypriots, Yugoslavs, Maltese or any one
of a dozen different nationalities, but
somehow it always comes out that they
are Italians.
More than 1000 motorists were halted
at the road blocks which, in the official
police phraseology, were “an intensifica-
tion of a particular form of investiga-
tion”.
The investigation is without doubt that
which is continuing into the shotgun
murders a few months ago. The men
murdered were all associated in one way
or another with the Victoria Market.
Just why they were murdered has yet to
be proved.
The Victorian Government has intro-
duced into Parliament a Bill which should
go a long way towards cleaning up the
market mess if it becomes law.
This Bill provides for a docket system
so that a complete record of all con-
signments sent'by producers to merchants
and agents will be available at all times.
The system would protect the producer
against unscrupulous agents who buy
cheap and sell dear.
There have been many stories of
almost illiterate, peasant-type market
gardeners not always Italian who
have been shockingly treated by mer-
chants and agents selling their produce
at the Market.
The recent flare-ups are not so much
the result of a “struggle for power” as
a last-ditch stand against inevitable con-
traction.
Although many housewives go to
great lengths to buy their supplies direct
at the Market, the prices these days are
often higher than those in suburban
supermarts.
The small market gardener as such is
doomed.
A revolution in the marketing of con-
sumer goods with foodstuffs well to
the fore was forecast at a merchan-
dising “workshop” organised by the Vic-
torian Employers’ Federation in Mel-
bourne recently. The speaker was Mr
E. B. Weiss, director of special merchan-
dising of a Madison Avenue advertising
agency.
Mr Weiss said that the broad trends
among manufacturers, wholesalers and
retailers towards “gigantism” was cur-
rently leading to a breakdown in the tra-
ditional lines of demarcation between
them.
Retailers as a result were becoming
large manufacturers and were also
moving into wholesale functions.
He said that the independent retailer
of general merchandise, including foods
and drugs, was doomed.
This trend is already well in evidence
in the retailing of frozen chickens and
meats and is growing in the case of
packaged vegetables (potatoes mainly)
and fruits.
The supermarts are being supplied
direct by huge factory-farms and the
Victoria Market type middleman is be-
ing cut right out.
Before long the supermart chains
may themselves either own, or control,
the farms supplying them. That system
might not be bad provided the farmer
gets a reasonable price for his produce,
The farmer-gardener, in the case of
fruit and vegetables, and the producer of
other foodstuffs will not be the illiterate,
peasant-type who is easily hoodwinked,
But it will not be all plain sailing, of
course.
One big poultry set-up has come in for
severe criticism over its methods of late,
The parent company supplies the feed,
the birds, and much of the equipment,
Some hundreds of individual farmers pro-
vide the labor and the sheds. The parent
company does the marketing.
The farmers complain that initially
the returns are good, but gradually
the parent company reduces the margin
of profit and there is little the farmers can
do because they are well and truly com-
mitted for a long period.
The same situation is said to have
developed with tomatoes and sweet
corn.
difficulties may not be insur-
mountable. A group of such farmers
are in a much better position to organise,
to get expert legal advice if necessary,
and to win support for their case than
is the individual battler sending his pro-
duce off to the Victoria Market or its
equivalent.
Meantime, the problem of what to do
with the battling individual put out of
business is something Mr Rylah and
governments generally might think seri- *
ously about.
Should the “racket-buster from the
FBI” succeed in sending the undoubted
parasites in the business “up the river
there will be a far greater number of
decent, hard-working, small gardeners
and producers (among them Italians) ,
who are going to be left behind in the
changeover which is beginning to gather ,
momentum. '
It is not only an Australian problem.
It is world-wide and it is to be hoped that
we do hot witness in this country some
of the scenes already taking plac e in
others.
In France, angry farmers have armed
themselves with pitchforks and marched
off to storm the big farms in their dis-
tricts.
Actor Jean Gabin is one large farmer
who has felt the point of the pitchfork,
so to speak. He owns a large, modem
farm in Brittany.
An angry mob accused him of rum-

ing several local small farmers by buying
up their land so that he could retire to
live “in the fashion of a squire”. It has
been reported that Gabin, in pyjamas,
wept as they shouted their insults.
Other men have been similarly abused
in what is termed the “new peasants’
revolt”, but the Gabin case makes the
best reading—particularly the bit about
him being in his pyjamas.
Disorder has reigned in the French
countryside for three years now over
what is simply a world-wide trend which
even President De Gaulle is unable to
check. The French peasants have pelted
Government mediators with artichokes
and have sabotaged railway lines. They
have also barricaded roads with their
tractors.
They do have tractors. In fact, they
are no more peasants in the historic
sense than are the farmers in this
country.
They are just small farmers and they
don't like what is happening to them.
In any expanding nation costs inevitably
favor the big man against the small.
The one glimmer of hope for the
small fellow is that he become a specia-
list producing something which is unique,
or for which there is a specialised de-
mand, providing he is able to arrange
his own marketing outlet.
Japanese Tractors Next?
Pushing farm machinery in return for wool
Japanese cars are becoming familiar
sights in Australia. How long will
it be before Japanese tractors are on the
market?
Not long, if the Japanese have their
way; but a very long time indeed if the
Australian, American and British manu-
facturers, who have most of the market
now, have their way.
Japanese agricultural machinery of
all kinds has made tremendous strides
recently.
Until two years ago Japanese manu-
facturers were fully engaged in supply-
ing their home market. Their main
products were small tillers suitable to
Japanese needs. Now they are looking
for exports and are designing and build-
ing implements accordingly.
Japanese makers established two firms
in Taiwan in 1960. These firms, initi-
ally to produce tillers, were set up by
Kubota Iron Works (Mitsui) and by
Izeki Noki-Yanmar Diesel.
Kubota now has plants in Brazil and
Burma and is negotiating to build a plant
in India. Izeki Noki is building in
Brazil.
Komatsu Seisakujo is another manu-
facturing firm increasing its sales through-
out Asia. This concern is linked with
International Harvester.
Honda, maker of the motor cycles, is
expanding into farm machinery and has
already placed orders in France and
Thailand.
The Japanese are producing imple-
ments with readily interchangeable parts
specially suited to local conditions. They
are also concentrating on the lower
horsepower tractors which—until the re-
cent advent of the Fiat Factotum and
the Massey Ferguson 30 had disap-
peared in the horsepower race in most
other countries.
As with cars and motor cycles there
is no doubt of the quality of the Japanese
farm implements.
Apart from local sales, the message
for Australian tractor interests is that
exporting Australian tractors and imple-
ments to Asia is not going to get any
easier.
Design and finish will need to be of
a particularly high standard to compete
successfully with the Japanese products.
In view of our mounting dependence
on Japan as a wool customer, Japanese
interests are bound to seek opportunities
of pushing sales here of farming or asso-
ciated machinery and plant. New Zea-
land obviously had an eye on this when
she recently purchased 150 cold storage
railway cars for meat from the Japanese
Kinki Sharyo company. Fifty of the
cars were bought complete and the re-
maining 100 semi-complete.
An item which Japan could supply us
with little or no repercussions internally
is chemical fertiliser. Our superphos-
phate stocks are limited and alternatives
must be found.
Japan is exporting 2\ million tons of
chemical fertiliser this financial year
mainly to Indonesia, South Korea and
the Philippines, and some to Europe,
Mexico and India. The main fertilisers
are ammonium sulphate and urea.
Japan also is exporting increasing
quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables
despite its huge home demand. This
bodes ill for Australian fruit farmers who
are sorely in need of increased sales in
Asia now that the European market has
tightened.
Apples, potatoes and onions are the
three biggest Japanese exports in this
particular field. Other items include
mandarins, pears, tomatoes, radishes,
plums and ginger.

THE BULLETIN has been a famous name in Australia

years of continuous weekly publication it has seen
many changes. Two years ago it got a new cover

Royal Palace, Bangkok. KLM flies to 104 cities in 68 countries
Visit fascinating Bangkok on your next trip
to Europe or the East by reliable KLM
(With KLM you can make many stops
en route to your final destination at no extra air fare.)
Add a dash of South-east Asian spice to your overseas trip. Take
time to meet the friendly Thailanders. When you book your flight
with reliable KLM, you can arrange to stopover in Bangkok for
a sight-seeing tour at no extra air fare. From Bangkok, KLM can
fly you comfortably to Japan, India, Western or Eastern Europe,
the Middle East, Africa (N. S. E. or W.), North, South or Central
America. Here are more reasons why many experienced Australian
travellers prefer to fly KLM.
1. Bangkok offers oriental charm,
western comfort, unique shopping oppor-
tunities. Hotels have air conditioning,
bar and restaurant facilities, swimming
pools. Sights to see: Buddhist temples,
classical dancers, bustling canals and
the colourful floating market. Things
to buy: Thai silks, wood carvings,
bronze and silverware, jewellery
2. KLM has had longer than any other
airline to perfect its reliability —44
years. KLM was the first European
airline to fly to the “Far East.” KLM’s
total route network is 144,000 undupli-
cated miles —the second-largest inter-
national air network in the world.
KLM has trained the crews of 26 other
airlines, provided maintenance for 28
and catering for 15.
3. Japanese stewardesses, wearing kim-
onos, add a touch of Oriental hospitality
on KLM's DC-8 jet flights to and from
Tokyo. Japanese-speaking travellers are
made to feel right at home. Menus
give passengers a choice of European
or Japanese dishes.
4. KLM engineers maintain their DC-8
jets with a series of exacting check-ups.
In KLM’s US$6 million workshop at
Amsterdam, careful KLM craftsmen
clean pistons and cylinders with crushed
cherry stones. They also use X-rays,
closed-circuit .television, ultrasonic
washing machines, ultra-violet light and
infra-red ovens. KLM technicians put
in an average of 74,475 man-hours a
year in order to maintain one DC-8 jet.
No wonder KLM is the only European
airline entrusted with NATO jet over-
hauls.

5. A KLM DC-8 intercontinental jet
leaves Sydney every Thursday at 10.45
a.m. Melbourne passengers can make
a same-day connection comfortably.

If you want to fly on to Europe or to
Tokyo you can be there by Friday.

plan your trip. He is an expert and
will show you how to make the most
of your time and money.
