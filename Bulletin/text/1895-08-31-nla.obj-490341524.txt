“The hoots fit splendidly ai d are very cheap. You

is in vogue. I shall do what I can to recommend you.”
GEO. PAMMENT, Seddon-st., Kumars, N.Z. May 7, 1895.
“ The hoots you made me from description of my foot
and S'lf measurements have more than satisfied me. I
never had a pair of such well-fitting and comfortable
bools—so much so, that I have discarded all my old
enemies. Your price, with duty and everything, does
not come up to the price charged here for hoots’not to
be compared with vonrs.”—JOHN M‘ARTHUR, Police
Magistrate, Longreach, Queensland. May 31, 1895.
“ I am sending you an order tor two more pairs of your
boots. Those you sent me were a splendid fit, and for
workmanship and durability they could not he surpassed.
I have had them in wear now 12 months, and there is not
a crack in them, and I have no more trouble with my in-

And to prove this, I will GIVE you a bottle of my
remedy for nothing ; so that you may have the chance
to try it before paying out any money. This shows
what I think of the remedy, and I am sure a trial of it
will soon convince you of its sterling merit. I have
made a life-long study of Fits, Epilepsy, or Falling
Sickness, and when 1 say CURE, do not mean merely
to stop them for a time, but a radical CURE. Because
others have failed to relieve you, is no good reason why
you should continue to suffer. Send for my treatise,

WHEN THE BAILIFF BRINGS A
WARRANT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You’ll think selecting pleasant when you tackle it
at first,
When you've left the grinding city—the city that
you’ve curst;
When the burning-off is over and the seed you’ve
sown is up,
And you’ve got sufficient sugar for every second
cup.
Then you’ll see a glorious future and you'll dream
by night and day
Of corn and wheat and “ taters ” and such things
which never pay ;
And you’ll wonder why they hang around the
blessed town below
Till the bailiff brings a warrant and your cows
have got to go—
Till your cows have got to go.
When you’ve reaped a dozen harvests (all golden
ones, of course),
When the baby’s into breeches and young Tom
can work a horse ;
When the grass is looking splendid and the gully’s
running over,
And you’ve time to say “Good-morning ! ” to the
westward-going rover—
You’ll boast of bags and bushels and of what
you’ve just “ put in,”
And you’ll gaze upon the hay-stack till you fancy
that it’s “ tin ” ;
You’ll feel happy, and contented till there come a
tale of woe
When the bailiff brings a warrant arid the nags
have got to go—
When the nags have got to go.
When the season gives fairpromise and the winter’s
nearly o’er
And you’ve gathered in the pumpkins and put
boarding on the floor ;
When you’ve raised the wind so high that you can
tell the time of day
Without going by your shadow as the sun goes on
his way,
You’ll think it nearly time then for a pleasure-
trip to town,
And you'll “yaeker” all the harder on the strength
of going down ;
But you’ll wish the lot. to Sheol and you’ll curse
the blessed show
When the bailiff brings a Warrant and it All has
got to go—
When it all has got to go.

THE TOWNSHIP LIGHTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With laughter and love-spells and witch-eyes of
blue
There’s a girl in the township is waiting for you.
There is nothing that thrills like a handclasp of
hers,
So bridle your best horse and buckle your spurs ;
We’ll wait not for moonlight but saddle and ride
With the lights of the township our goal and our
guide.
There are glasses to empty and yarns to be spun ;
There are cards to be handled and coin to be won ;
There are light-footed dancers that wait in the
hall
For the boys from the station to open the ball,
With its waltzes for woomg and lancers for love
While the lights of the township are dancing
above.
The day has been long in the dust and the heat,
But the way will be short with a guerdon so sweet,
The songs of the rover will shorten the miles
That the queen of our fancy makes bright with
hei smiles.
And stirrup to stirrup we’ll sing as we ride
To the lights of the township that glimmer and
guide.
We’ll welcome old faces, our glasses we ll fill
Till the silver moon drops on the crest of the hill ;
The words of our love to the night shall be borne,
Our song to the dawnwind J _our laugh to the morn,
We’ll dance till the sunbeams are out in the sky
And the lights of the township gleam faintly and
die.
The world may despise us, and parsons disprove
That the night is for dancing and drinking and
love,
But we’ll saddle our horses and ride to the dance
And drink to the beauty that kills at a glance—
We’ll hold to our loves and we’ll stick to our creed
As long as the lights of the township may lead !

SATURDAY, AUGUST 31, 1895.
The State as a Murderer.
The social gulf thab yawns, with ludicrous
suddenness, between the wholeseller and the
smallseller of beer, or beef, or calico, or
coffee, is not so isolated a phenomenon as it
seems at first sight. Mankind is so largely
built that way, and makes such spontaneous
and habitual use of this principle of distinc-
tion that it is, for the most part, blind to
the fact that its real deity is Bulk. “Be
Big,” is society’s creed in a nutshell, “and
/ou will be Respectable ! ” Hence, Fatman,
O.M.G. Buy and sell ; cozen and swindle ;
pob and murder, even, if you will—bub,
ibove all things, be wholesale ! Don’t
peddle, or you are lost ! The gorgeous
creature who superintends—in tinsels and
reatheis—the shooting and stabbing by one
?eb of men of a lob of others who have
never done them any harm, gets glory
ind gratulation, instead of the gallows with
which we punish the solitary slayer of his
idnd for being in such a ridiculously small
way of business. The fellow who squeezes a
windoipe and annexes a watch gets six months
uid the cat merely because he is injudicious
enough to undertake, as a private enterprise
uid for his material profit, the “robbery
with violence ” which the nation, at the same
;ime and for exactly the same reason, is com-
Hitting wholesale upon a recalcitrant power
jf inferior strength—and in the name of
Tod ! The drunkard who gets a shilling
Iroin his “uncle” upon his spare shirt per-
forms precisely the same commercial opera-
don as the great lady who gets a couple of
diousands upon her diamonds from her
banker; but, while the “hypothecation”
brings no discredit to anybody concerned
therein, the “pawning” is looked upon as a
more or less reprehensible transaction be-
sween two more or less disreputable persons,
And the difference is just the difference
between one shilling and forty thousand !
“You pawned your watch, sir,” once said
Purves, Q.C., to Mortimer Fran klyn (with
a “y ”)• “ I prefer to say ‘ hypothecate,’ ”
replied Franklyn. “Pawn,” you see, is a
retail word.
Probably, therefore, it is chiefly by
reason of the magnitude of its slaughterings
that the State has hitherto so largely escaped
consideration in its capacity as a murderer.
But, since the fatalities of war and pestilence
and famine and earthquake slip so rapidly
away from the focus of public interest, it
is not surprising that the State’s domestic
slayings should never, so far, have come
properly within that focus. Now and then,
perhaps, there is uplifted in the market-
place a weird and solitary voice, crying aloud
against the equanimity with which the com-
munity persists in making the acquaintance,
through its stomach, of all manner of
ghastly diseases. And the community —after
•lending half-an-ear for half-a-minute —
admits that it is all very true and very
deplorable, and goes on tranquilly murder-
ing itself and its descendants as before,
through the indirect but highly effectual
method of almost totally neglecting to ascer-
tain that what it puts into its mouth to
sustain life is not, instead, a vehicle of in-
fection and death.
# * #
The recent discovery by a N.S. W. police-
sergeant of masses of tuberculous corruption
in the throats of a large number of pigs
intended for consumption, is a cheerful
circumstance which points pretty certainly
to the conclusion that loads of similar loath-
someness reach undetected the public market
and the public stomach. Also, the fact
that in New South Wales it should be left
to a policeman to make —or not to make—
such pleasing discoveries, is but another
illustration of the placid indifference with
which the State—while abundantly concerned
about human diseases, in esse —regards the
admitted source, in posse, of about the worst
and most hopeless of them all. Tuber-
culosis—easily communicable to the human
subject per medium of insufficiently cooked
meat or milk—affects not only cattle, sheep,
and pigs, but also fowls, which frequently
contract the disease by picking up the dried
sputa of the human consumptive. So that,
as there is in New South Wales no official
supervision of vended poultry, it is hard to
say how liberally the State may not, in this
special direction, have contributed to its
own bills of mortality. But it has plenty of
other homicidal opportunities, and that it
has no wish to forego them is evidenced by
the airy insouciance with which it intrusts to
utterly incompetent hands the nationally
momentous duty of inspecting the edible
animal before death, or the flesh thereof
after it.
• # #
About 8 per cent, of market cattle, it is
estimated, are diseased —tuberculosis, the
commonest ailment, being also frequently
one of the most difficult to detect, be-
cause the characteristic emaciation of the
human subject is unusual in the beast,
which may, even up to the last stages of the
disease, give little external sign of its con-
dition. In a tuberculosed sheep, also, the
localisation of the disease in neck or groin
may be so little noticeable that the animal
may easily be sold or slaughtered as in proper
health and condition. Cancer, too, though
of doubtful communicability to human
beings, is a horror to which no sane man
would be willing to give the benefit of the
doubt, and the flesh of animals fevered by
over-driving or parturition is productive of
very serious enteric effects. Pigs, though
exempt in this part of the world from the
ravages of the deadly trichina spiralis, get
pretty level again with a special liability to
contagious pneumonia, and the sheep adds
to tuberculosis and anthrax, a list of diseases
peculiarly its own,
• # •
All which things—taken in connection
with the assertion that we are the greatest
meat : eaters in the world—furnish a grim
commentary on the three facts that to be a
thoroughly competent stock and meat in-
spector a man must be a systematically-
trained veterinarian ; that there are but
half-a-dozen such officially employed in New
South Wales ; and that the local stock-
inspector, who has practically, therefore, the
stomach of the province in his hands, is, as
often as not, appointed to the post for any
or every reason but special qualification for
the work. He may, as sergeant of police,
have the duty just carelessly “chucked-in,”
as it were, with a multiplicity of others, or
he may, as an ex-cattle-salesman, possess
sufficient rule-of-thumb knowledge to recog-
nise readily enough the commoner forms of
the commoner stock-diseases. Or he may
have got the billet simply because he is “a
party by the name of Johnson,” or has
“ obliged Benson,” or is somebody’s brother
Bill ! And, even when he knows anthrax
from pleuro, or foot-rot from fluke, he can-
not be in two places—nor in two hundred—
at the same time.
• # #
The vast area of the province, no doubt,
renders impossible that universal and minute
supervision which alone could entirely pre-
vent the sale of diseased meat —alive or dead.
But that the State cannot do all, is no reason
why it should do nothing ! It could, at all
events, abolish the incompetent inspector
and the private slaughter-house. From the
latter goes forth in all directions an abund-
ance of death-dealing stuff’, of which the
former wots not, and which, probably, even
if he did “ wot,” he wouldn’t be able to
“spot.” The Noxious Trades and Slaughter-
ing Act confers upon municipalities possess-
ing public abattoirs the power to forbid
slaughtering elsewhere, but in not a single
instance has the veto been exercised ! The
ignorant and brutal municipal authorities,
like Briggs of Ballast-quarries, “ don’t care,"
and the State—as represented by the Legisla-
ture—didn’t apparently care either, or it
would have permitted of no option in the
matter.
* • •
Stock and meat inspection in New South
Wales, therefore, is a howling farce —with a
background of unescapable tragedy. And,
therefore, again, the State, which compla-
cently folds its hands over such a monstrosity
—which deliberately, also, sells hell-tire
spirits out of bond, and which refuses to
preclude (by becoming its own sole publican)
the wholesale poisoning of the citizens
with similar abominations—is a murderer
upon a scale so vast and comprehensive and
far-reaching that its criminality in this direc-
tion has come apparently to be regarded as
part of the immutable order of things by a
public which nevertheless raises a howl of
horror over the surreptitious elimination of
half-a-dozen infants, or waxes wildly hysteri-
cal over the loss of a score or two of lives in
a shipwreck.
The Japanese Invasion.
One of Chas. Kingsley’s most forcible poems
tells how “ the merry brown hares came leap-
ing ” over a piece of English farm-land —
Leaping late and early,
Till under their bite and their tread
The swedes and the wheat and the barley
Lay-cankered and trampled and dead.
In some such fashion a local poet might describe
the Japanese invasion of Australia and its
results. The little brown men come leaping
over our north-eastern and north-western border
by scores and hundreds. Every Yokohama
ship brings a few', and a few more. And
wherever they go the destruction of white
industry follows in their train. Sooner or later,
every Japanese who comes here ousts a white
man from a profitable calling. If Australia is
to be and remain a white nation, the home of
white races, it is time for the provincial Parlia-
ments to say that the Japanese, like the Chinese,
“must go”—or, at least, that their coming be
finally stopped. This step must be taken ; and
every year, every week, every day that it is
deferred, the danger and difficulty of taking it
increase. The Japanese have hardly yet made
good their position. Once let them become
entrenched and fortified, and no one can guess
what it may cost to shift them.
f # # #
The question is not to be disposed of by the
sneer that Australians are fond of a bogey, and
that the chief result of the recent war, so far as
we are concerned, has been the substitution of
a Japanese bogey for the familiar Chinese one.
The Chinese invasion was never a bogey : it
was a grave danger, and it is so still. The
younger generation hears with surprise that
there was a time when the Chinese in Victoria
numbered about 13 per cent, of the adult male
population ; when 4000 Chinese lay in quaran-
tine on Fitzroy Island (Q.), the Colonial Office’s
refusal to sanction restrictive legislation having
forced the Government of the day to declare
the whole Chinese Empire in quarantine !
There are still 40,000 Chinese in Australia ; and
in the Northern Territory, where they almost
monopolise the gold-mining industry, there
were at the ’9l census only 1159 whites to 3392
Chinese. The Japanese danger is not substi-
tuted for the Chinese : it is added to it. And
the Japanese invasion is the more to be dreaded
because the Jap has all the virtues of the China-
man and more besides ; because he is supported
by a strong, alert Government, keenly alive to
the national advantage, keenly sensitive to
slights on the national iionor ; and because there
are obvious commercial advantages to Australia
in the budding trade with Japan, and some
Australian traitors to their country will
endeavor to grasp commercial profits at what-
ever cost of national disaster.
# * # /
There is one man, standing at a Northern
outpost of Australian civilisation, who has had
during the last 10 years special opportunities
for observing the effects on white industry of
the Japanese invasion. Thursday Island is the
first port of call on the eastern coast for Asiatic
steamers ; it is the favorite landing-place of un-
attached Japanese ; it is now a chiefly Japanese
settlement. In March, ’94, there were 720
Japanese to 651 Europeans ; and the proportion
of Japs, has since increased. John Douglas,
Q. Government Resident at Thursday Island,
says in his last-issued report (March 6, ’94): —
The continuous stream of Japanese immigration, if
maintained, will soon completely change the character of
our maritime population. It has had the effect of driving
away many of the South Sea Islanders, who are the best
seamen we have. Wages have dropped from £3 a month
to 305., and they may go down to 20s. This is not an
unmixed gain, and it seems to be possible that the [pearl-
shelling] industry may pass very largely into the hands
of aliens. Two years ago there were not 20 boats owned
and manned by Japanese. Now’ there are upwards of 70,
and of these 38 are owned by Japanese. This is a matter
which merits the serious attention of Parliament.
The hint was plain enough ; but Q. Parliament,
with its majority employed in propping up their
bank, took no notice. Q. Ministry, indeed, was
understood to have “ made representations” to
the Japanese Govt, in July last year, but
nothing came of them except fresh instalments
of Japanese immigrants for the sugar-planta-
tions.
» # *
Meanwhile the Thursday Island evil has been
increasing. Seen last month by a Bulletin
representative Mr. Douglas said :
The Japanese now either possess or are working out on
credit nearly 100 boats, and, as things are going, it looks
as if they will before long own l he fisheries altogether.
They are slowly hut surely winning Thursday Island, and
what they are doing here they may do elsewhere. They
are hard-working, abstemious, and clever, and they stick
to one another closely. They are heaven-born co-
operators, and in this respect more formidable rivals than
the, Chinese. In the boats they are all ambitious to
become divers. When one man comes up another puts
on the dress and goes down, and so on. Thus a Japanese
boat will sometimes be at work from dawn to dark ; at
any rate, they can and do work longer hours than the
ordinary boat, in which there is only one diver. Then,
again, those of I hem w ho are educated are most inde-
fatigable in sunlying English. I have a boy in my house
just now who w orks away every evening at his phrase-
book with an English and Japanese dictionary. Our
local bookseller tells me that the best-educated among
them buy useful books, grammar and arithmetic hooka
I took up a book in hia shop, the other day—“ The Com-
plete Letter-Writer” (“ by a member of the aristocracy,"
if you please !) “That ia a great favorite with the Japs,”
he said ; “ I have sold at least a dozen copies to them."
They have their own shops, their own boat-building slip,
and they are trying (they say) to establish a public-house
of their own. Altogether they are' most assimilative.
Here in Thursday Island it will soon be a case of the sur-
vival of tiie fittest; and, if they go on as they are doing,
the Caucasian will be played 1 have really a great
respect for I he Japanese, and have a great admiration for
their physical and mental capacity'; but if the projected line
of steamers between Australia and Japan is going to bring
us further heavy contingents, to be landed at all out
ports, I say “ Look out I ”
# * #
The men who brought the Japanese divers to
Thursday Island bitterly regret it. For the
Jap., unlike the Chinaman, is not content to be
man. He will be master. As Mr. Douglas
says, he is tireless, industrious, inventive, and
—the secret of his success—he knows how to
combine. The Japanese community at Thurs-
day Island imports as much as possible from
Japan ; deals as little as possible with the
whites. Jap. helps Jap. sedulously. Every
now and again a while boat-owner is forced out
of the competition ; his boat is purchased and
christened by a Japanese name ; there is general
Japanese f*6joiCTrfg7 r< We will sooh be bursters
here altogether,” said one the other day. They
have more adaptability than their white rivals,
and at least as imTch ability. The representa-
tive Jap. at Thursday Island is a University
graduate —LL.B. Down the coast the same
characteristics are shown. The sugar laborers
look to the time when they will be sugar-
farmers—and work for it. Many already lease
or own land ; and the others are keenly emu-
lous. It is the same on the western side of
Australia—the Jap. divers are gradually sup-
planting their masters. Westralia, too, does a
flourishing trade in women, who come under
contract for five years to Japanese brothels.
And sex does not alter race-characteristics—
whitejjtomen, like men, cannot live with their
little brown competitors.
# # #
All this, of course, is an old story elsewhere.
The pushing, restless bearing of the Japs, in
Hawaii has earned them the title of “ the Eng-
lish of the Pacific.” Brought in as sugar
laborers, they now control several plantations.
They “ strike ” just like a white man, and exact
the uttermost farthing of possible wages. In
California, the 10,000 Jap. vineyard laborers
have brought dismay into the white ranks.
What competition is possible with men who are
used at home to work gladly for 3d. a day ?
The Englishman, American, Australian, are
expensive animals. They are habituated to
luxuries ; they waste in a week enough money
in food, and drink, and lodging to keep a
Japanese family for three months. We are the
superior race, we say. It may be ; but our
wants are our masters. The Jap knows no
such master. He developes the maximum of
energy with the minimum of expenditure.
Where he gets his foot his body follows. Ajhd
already he is getting footing in Australia. Ad-
vertisements for and by Japanese servants are
common in the daily papers ; there is an agency
in .Sydney for indenting Japanese laborers in
any number desired. What is to be the end
of it ?
# # •
And note this : the Japanese Covernment is
not, like that of China, an oafish and ostenta-
tious sluggard. It is jealous, intelligent,
aspiring. It is not likely to endure maltreat-
ment of its subjects by a foreign power ; more
probably it will strenuously insist on thmr
right to rank as equal citizens in any country
on earth. When Japanese coolies in Fiji, the
other day, fell sick of an epidemic, the Govern-
ment sent a doctor all the way from Japan to
enquire into the circumstances.- China would
not have done that. Moreover, Japan is
imbued with a keen spirit of patriotism. When
Germany, Russia, and France insisted on the
abrogation of the terms of peace with China,
and the cession by Japan of her spoils on t he
mainland, the people were furiously indignant
with the Government for giving way. Shrewd
observers say it did give way only because
it felt its fleet unequal to that of the
three allies. And now the Government has
ordered another half-dozen ironclads. The
Japanese are determined that intruders in Asia
shall know that Japan must be reckoned with.
» # •
The Japs., in fact, good-humored though
they be, have a touchy, warlike strain in a
temperament as easily kindled as that of French-
men. They do not hesitate to measure their
strength with that of Britain —and one Jap.
journal recently referred with contempt to the
shopkeeping country as “ the unwieldy China
of the West,” and suggested that it would be
easily dealt with by the victorious Japanese
troops. The ideal of .the nation, says the com-
petent Henry Norman, is “Japan for the
Japanese,” and behind this is the dream of
“Asia for the Asiatics”—a confederacy of
Asiatic nations with Japan as arbiter and
chief. Realisation is quite possible. No
revolution could achieve more marvellous re-
sults than that which transformed feudal Japan
into modern Japan in less than 30 years.
Japanese manufacturers are now outdoing Man-
chester, snatching trade from India. They
have the immense advantage of cheap silver.
Population is greater than that of the British
Islands, and nearly as dense. There has already
been large immigration. Is Australia also to
become a Japanese colony ?
# * •
It has received a dexterous invitation. Aus-
tralian Governments have been asked to notify
their wish for inclusion as parties to last year’s
treaty between Britain and Japan. If they do,
they agree that the Japanese shall have full
liberty to enter, travel, or reside in any part of
Australia. They agree that the Japanese shall
have the same rights at law, the same
commerce, as an Australian citizen. They
agree that the Japanese shall not be compelled,
on any pretext whatever, to pay any taxes
which natives do not pay. And one
powerful section of the Australian daily
press —which has been lately printed on
Japanese-made paper—is apparently eager for
this treaty to bo swallowed. The Chambers of
Commerce at Adelaide and Brisbane are con-
sidering the question “ in the interests of
trade,” though Sydney Chamber doubts whether


trade may not be too dearly purchased at the
price. The Victorian Government has an
Lent in Japan looking for markets ; and it is
(l uite possible that Vic. Parliament may be
asked to ratify the treaty. Therefore, Ihe
Bulletin has stated the facts as it knows
them the risks as it sees them, and now makes
demand whether Australians are prepared to
sacrifice their birthright for a mess of com-
mercial pottage.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Totalisator or Total Abstinence.
Murray, M.L.A., having failed to raise more
than a dozen tote supporters in Vic. Assembly,
threatens the bookmakers with a bill to sup-
press public betting of every description. I Ins
proposal evoked sundry joyful resolutions from
the Loard’s anointed, and would, if sincerely
and vigorously pushed, have the effect of either
abolishing the turf or compelling Parliament to
legalise the “evil” it now pretends to dis-
countenance. The ingenuous, or ingenious,
Murray Smith, who now wants to know
“ the difference between the totalisator and
Monte Carlo?” would find himself jammed into
a corner and compelled to admit a fatal want of
distinction between Flemington or Raudwick
racecourses and Monte Carlo aforesaid. You
stake your money on the table, or you place it in
Ikky Mo’s black-bag. When the ball hasfinished
rolling the croupier receives or pays, and when
your Gee-Gee has finished rolling croupier Mo
either refunds your investment with winnings
attached, or rakes it in, to all intents and pur-
poses, from the bag to his pocket. As a rule,
he rakes it in. Newmarket Heath is a Monte
Carlo, quite independent of the argument that
horses are noble animals and a corpulent Heir
Apparent gambles with them. You may
attend a meeting at Newmarket, Flemington,
or Randwick and watch the sport without
having “a shilling on a norse,” which is the
praptice of all moral- men (so they say) in-
terested in the improvement of blood-stock.
The same sophistical humbugs can drop into
the rooms at Monte Carlo and watch the game
in an equally harmless manner, if they like. A
billiard - tournament at a betting club is
a Monte Carlo, or, if you will, a handi-
cap race between men. In itself it is
a good thing, developing muscle, brains,
pluck, patience, and resignation among the
competitors —and an interested spectator is not
compelled to wager upon the chances of the
struggling bipeds. Murray, M.L.A., under-
stands all this, and Murray Smith could be
made to understand it by a plain, straightfor-
ward anti-racecourse Betting Bill. The Parlia-
ment which declares the- tote illegal, whilst
refusing to carry its war against the bookmaker
into the enemy’s camp (the racecourse) is a
disgracefully immoral institution. Stupidity is
the only excuse available for any tote opponent
who sits there, inasmuch as the truth concern-
ing the present Betting Act gets honest recog-
nition only from the tote’s adherents. The Bill
MußßAYmiy/ii introduce, if it were determined to
have bookmakers prohibited along with the tote
or legalised in conjunction with that more
respectable machine, would brand every man
who voted against it as a fool or a scoundrel.
At present, these two classes of undesirable
politicians are able to pass for moralists, and
the blessing of the Church is upon them. It
only remains for Murray to win a crown of
glory with a Bill so pure and sweet in senti-
ment that the Church will be properly shocked
when the moralists throw it out by a large
majority! And a bill to show parsons the
difference between the saint who hates and a
saint who loves Ikey Mo, would serve a
religious purpose, even though its scornful
'rejection led to the speedy acceptance of the
t >le.
Railway Ticket Scalping.
Last week The Bueeettn noted N.S.W. Post-
office’s prosecution of an express co. for carrying
letters. This week it records N.S.W. Full
Court’s decision that transfer of railway-tickets
is illegal—another effort on the part of a Stale
monopoly to secure the exclusion of competitors
for its profits. The cases, however, are not on
all-fours. The express co. supplied a public
want which the P.O, left unsupplied, and its
operations were therefore legitimised by the
public interest. The railway ticket-scalper,
who thrives by purchasing unused halves of
return-tickets and re-selling them fdr less than
single fare, gives the public no new convenience,
nothing that it cannot obtain already. He
cheapens railway-journeys for some travellers,
but his profit means a direct loss to the railway
revenue, and such a loss is directly borne by
other travellers at ordinary rates, and by the
public who do not travel at all. In other
words, the scalper and his purchasing cus-
tomers make an illegitimate profit at the
expense of the general body of taxpayers. In
the public interest, the Railway Commissioners
are right to end the scalper’s business if they
can. They would be wrong if they sanctioned
the cutting of rates to any section of the public
outside their regulations. The Supreme Court
gives them the right to make tickets non-trans-
ferable, and there the legal aspect ends. But
the purchaser of a return-ticket has* and feels
that he has, an equitable claim on the Commis-
sioners for the half he does not use, and it would
be judicious for the Commissioners to acknovy-
ledge that claim. If a man who transfers his
unused ticket makes an illegal profit, the
Commissioners get from the man who destroys
Ids Unused ticket an inequitable profit. He
pays them for a service which, from one reason
or.another, they do not perform. And, as the
Commissioners calculate the price of tickets on
the understanding that they represent services
to be performed, they would lose nothing by
returning the price of a ticket which represents
an unperformed service—less, say, 10 or 15 per
cent, for cost of issue. The steamship co.’s do
this, charging varying rates for the concession.
Until the Railway Commissioners do it also,
whatever the law may be, their tickets will be
rightly transferred as often as the public can
lo it without fear of detection. The State has
'lie right to protect the community, but every
'udividual has the right to protect himself.
A Freak Parson.
Globe-trotting parson Joe Cook, spreading
himself on 11 Law and Labor, Property and
Poverty,” in Sydney, last week, merely blather-
skited. “I would have complete freedom of
contract,” said he. Only a few minutes before
he had cadged for popularity by saying that
“if Australians are to do justice to their
colored fellows, they must give their attention
to a reform of the contract system under which
colored labor is at present employed.” What,
then, becomes of “complete freedom of con-
tract ? ” If the holy man’s humbug means
anything, it is equivalent to an admission that
he regards “ complete freedom of contract ” as
a “ system ” that needs “ reform.” Which was
not to be demonstrated. Again, roars the
bellowing apostle, this time (as reported by
Sydney D.T.) stultifying himself in the small
compass of a single short sentence: —
He believed in the rule of supply and demand, and
would not have Government determine the rate of wages,
which, he held, ought always to be equal to twice the
cost of living.
Once more, palpable ground-bait ! In the name
of crooked logic, who is to determine what sum
is “ equal to twice the cost of living”? And if
wages “ ought always to be equal to twice the
cost of living,” how can they' be regulated by
“the rule of supply and demand”? In the
time of famine, “the cost of living” may be
“ 16 times x,” and “ the rule of supply and
demand ” may give only “ one-half of x.” Yet,
according to Cooker (not Cocker), that famine-
time will produce the equation —
x
16 x = —, or 32 x = x.
2
What sort of vanity permeates the professional
parson who sets himself up on a pedestal as a
big-brained man, claiming to have thoroughly
studied all the up-to-date branches of all the
sciences, who poses as a teacher of the human
race, and who then publicly vomits forth such
contradictory twaddle as the above ? The
political and economic parson is a freak of
nature.
Law v. Human Nature.
Editor Bulletin, —The statement of a Sydney
publican that his insolvency was owing to his
refusal to do a Sunday trade, looks like a solid
fact, for Sydney hotels are of two classes : a
minority which can afford to keep within the
law, and a majority which must break the law
or burst. The Sunday restriction is chiefly a
hardship to the casual visitor, and even he
speedily learns that it is only necessary to join
the crowd that vyaits its turn at the back-door
of the third-class hotel to get his glass of bad
grog without trouble. In like manner the way
is open for anyone to put his money on the
tote. Of course the tote is mostly a swindle.
No winner gets a fair dividend; and should a
new-chum think the game good enough to run
straight at, on the 10 per cent, basis, the police
will soon convince him to the contrary. You
cannot pay blackmail on a betting-shop, or
keep open-house on Sundays, on a legitimate
profit. It is idiotic to blame the Force —they
are neither better nor worse than any other
crowd of men. People will drink and gamble,
and if Govt, refuses to charge a legal toll their
servants will take an illegal one. Human
nature is like that ; and until the police are
recruited by Gabriel and composed of his
angels no change can be reasonably ex-
pected. It may be desirable that we
should not drink to excess, eat too much,
gamble, or indulge in sexual vices, but
making such acts illegal is not only useless,
it is criminal. For the man who has drunk an il-
legal glass of beer, or the lad who puts a shilling
on the illegal tote, has learned contempt for the
law. The policeman who takes his weekly
dole from publican, bagnio-keeper, or betting-
den lias learnt contempt for discipline. Thus
the morals of the whole people are sapped—by
“Law.” Why not have a Sunday Liquor
License, a Tote License, and so on? If the
social quagmire cannot be smothered why not
fence it in? You may regulate what you can-
not kill. And the vices of the people
that fill our gaols and hospitals may fairly
pay their cost to the community. So long
as honest labor does not earn honest
reward, people will seek illegal gains in
gambling and speculation for the spoliation they
have suffered. And the exploited worker sees
no remedy but to exploit somebody else. We
know that alcoholic and sexual cravings are
medical, not legal, questions, yet we put up gaols
when hospitals are wauled. No rational school-
master, nowadays, tries to teach Euclid with a
ro d—he finds the blackboard better. But the
Law is no “ forrarder ” than the pedagogue of
the year One. We smile at the superstitions of
our ancestors, and on all questions but those of
vital importance laugh at their judgment ; in
ethics alone do we open our mouths and shut
our eyes and see what Plantagenets will send
us.— H.F.
Editor Bulletin, —Is it not a sufficient reason
for abolishing the Second Chamber that the
chief difficulty of modern Parliaments is that
there is not enough time to properly discuss
laws desired by the people ? If so, then any-
thing that lessens that difficulty without involv-
ing greater evils will be good. Assuming that
the Legislative Council has, in many cases, pre-
vented bad laws, has it not done more harm by
delaying good ones which have ultimately
passed, but only at the expense of much time
that might have been given to the discussion of
other useful measures? Given an elective
executive —the province divided into about 10
electorates, and the right of a certain propor-
tion of the House (say one-third) to demand
that any measure as carried be referred to the
electors for veto —is it probable that the State
would suffer merely through hasty legislation
when, in the meantime, the measure would be
discussed in the press and on the platform? If
the people desire a law they should have it —
good or bad. If bad, it will soon be found so
and repealed, and probably be done with for a
generation. The present necessity for requiring
the sanction of both Houses (which should both
be representative of the people) is like requiring
a man with a very bad stutter to speak his wish
twice before granting if, .on the stupid assump-
tion that he may not mean what he says with
so much difficulty the first time. —Tawa.
Re N.S.W. Post Office’s prosecution of an
express-messenger co. for delivering letters.
The justification of a State monopoly is that its
operations benefit a majority of the people, and
benefit them more on the whole than private
competition does. The State monopoly of the
Post-office is so justified. No infraction of that
monopoly should be permitted unless it gives
to a majority of the people some benefit which
the State cannot, or will nob, or does nob give,
or to a minority some benefit which does not
involve a greater loss to the majority. On the
other hand, no State monopoly should be
allowed to own a field of public convenience
which it does not till, or to pursue a dog-in-
the-manger policy of excluding private competi-
tors from a business which it is unwilling or
incompetent to carry on. And a State mono-
poly must always maintain its superior
efficiency—the justification of its existence. It
cannot be allowed to sell inferior services at a
high price on the mere ground that- it is a-. State
monopoly. State Socialism is instituted because
State Socialism pays the community. The
moment it ceases to pay, on the whole, in any
sphere, or in any part of any sphere, no invoca-
tion of a State-fetish can give it credentials to
remain.

Cromaboo: We hate poetry about .the greenness of Ire

and yellow in the complexions of the Australians them
selves; whereas in England you see thousands of people,
quite healthy, but with complexions which, from an Aus-
tralian standpoint, are mere pictures of apoplexy. II
ever in Australia you see perfect “Irish” green it it
always associated with corruption—with the spot, foi
instance, where a bullock has foundered or a horse died,
or a man been buried. Here, in fact, you rarely see real
green except in the oemetery-advt. painting on the under

that it did not show Truth as she is known to the

If Queen Victoria sent a telegram to
Berlin (as the cable said) congratulating German
dragoons on their heroic charges against the
French array under Bazaine, in 1870, then it is
quite time that the ancient lady abdicated. Apart
from its bad taste, the telegram was absurd.
Valor is proved only by valor. If the Germans
fought specially well in some particular battle
the Frenchmen must have given them a fine
chance to do it. Why not compliment both
sides? And who gave V.R. permission to send
such a telegram “on her own?” As the figure-
head of the British Empire she has no business to
speak on any matter relating to quarrels betwc en
other States, unless her Prime Minister pulls the
string.
From Parkes, N.S. W., comes a pathetic
story. The body of Thomas Fitzgerald was
found, with a rope round his neck, hanging down
a shaft. He was a native of Victoria, 59 years of
age, and left eight children living. Latterly he
had been very poor, very ill, and in low spirits.
His wife deposed that on Saturday morning her
husband rose at 6 o’clock, baked two batches tf
bread, and afterwards came and knelt at her bed-
side deploring their poverty. He cried out that
his heart was broken, and that, in the 23 years of
their married life, everything had gone against
him. He said he had never thought he would be
in such low circumstances, and then he went
away, saying he was going to the quartz ridges.
She never again saw her husband alive. His dead
body was found two days afterwards by his son.
Which recalls an Egerton (Vic.) miner who went
down a disused shaft and hung himself in a winze
=to be found 18 months later, when a ventuie-
some miner, exploring the workings, banged up
against his bones by candle light.
Dear Bulletin, —If N.S.W. must have a
second Chamber, why shouldn’t it be a small
council of advice and revision elected by the
Assembly ? Say a score or less of members, to be
chosen by the present Assembly ; a fifth or sixth
to retire every year and be eligible for re-election
by the Assembly of the day, A compact council
of brainy and experienced men, answerable to the
country through its representatives, would keep
in touch with public opinion, and only need to sit
a few hours a week. Functions: to amend and
revise bills. No initiative. Two rejections of
any measure by the council to necessitate the
referendum. With the referendum the expensive
election of a large council would be a superfluity.
Electing the Legislative Assembly makes the
country very tired and muzzy. Electing a second
chamber, or too much referendum, would be be-
fogging and a weariness to the flesh. The Assem-
bly could choose a better council than either the
Executive or the country. Better and more
independent men would serve on a council elected
by the Assembly than on a council answerable to
the Premier of the hour—through the Executive.
—J.B. [A remarkably unwise suggestion. The
objections to the Assembly as at present consti-
tuted are that in it a minority of electors, possibly
a majority of electors, have no representation ;
that it swarms with road-and-bridge members;
that the good man known all over the country is
almost invariably beaten in any single constitu-
ency by the interest of the local log-roller. The
proposed Chamber would be still more unrepre-
sentative, for the Assembly-minority would go
unrepresented. And, as like breeds like, the
creatures of an Assembly with an inch of brain
and a yard of mouth and a mile of pocket would
probably be 10 times meaner than their creators.
Complete confidence can be placed in no repre
sentative body however elected. The people can
fully trust none but me people.—Ed. B.]

and HEALTH.
WEARERS of CELLULAR UNDER-
CLOTHING are remarkably free from
colds and chills, because the clothing dries
quickly, and the body is chiefly surrounded by
air, instead of with damp-laden material.
CELLULAR UNDERCLOTHING
should be worn next to the skin during both
summer and winter, and extra outer-clothing
should be worn over the Cellular if additional
warmth is required during the coldest weather, so
that the air contained in the meshes of the
CELLULAR UNDERCLOTHING may escape

The Pitiful Case of a Cruelly-
wronged Woman .
A FEW years ago there lived in Melbourne one
Thomas Richard Butler, who was in some respects
a remarkable man. He was, or claimed to be, a
qualified chemist, and he possessed, or claimed to
possess, the power which is variously labelled
mesmeric, animal-magnetic, or hypnotic. That he
really could in some cases, by the use of “ passes,”
diminish or remove pain we have the testimony of
his wife—whose painful case The Bulletin now
proposes to put compactly before a public which,
so far, has read but scattered fragments of the
story.
Butler appears, further, to have possessed that
taste for toxicology which is liable at any time to
lead to such unpleasant inferences as have just
brought about the fruitless exhumation of the body
of a former employer of Butler’s. Not so with the
ability which the man displayed in the manufac-
ture of nostrums of the “ household ” order, to
which concoctions he further possessed a notable
knack of giving such ear-arresting designations as
“Forked Lightning,” “Annihilates” and the
like.
Some connection with certain land trans-
actions is supposed to have led to Butler’s
hurried departure to England, though not long
afterwards he returned to Victoria, and, after
a short stay, removed to Sydney. There he
carried on the manufacture and sale of such
things as plating-fluid, silvering-mixture, and
stove-polish. It was in consideration of his
putting this business, when he entered the employ,
ment of a chemist named Copp, entirely in Mrs.
Butler’s hands, that she foolishly signed an under-
taking not for three years to seek any maintenance
from her husband.
Some time after Butler became a member of the
Copp household, domestic differences are said to
have commenced, and it is certain, at any rate,
that Copp, a sober man, with markedly studious
tastes, took, about this time, to excessivedrinking.
Butler eventually came to have practical charge of
Copp’s pharmaceutical business, and, when Copp’s
rath r sudden death took place, it was ostensibly as
Mrs. Copp’s representative that Butler made such
strenuous efforts to have the usual autopsy dis-
pensed with. In the end of March, ’92, about 14
weeks after Copp’s death, Mrs. Copp gave birth
to a child, about which the only fact that need be
mentioned here is that its name was registered as
Nellie Butler Copp—Nellie, it appears; being the
name of Butler’s sister.
Mem while, things had been growing so bad
with Mrs. Butler that, when she found the nos-
trum business dwindling to nothing, she was
obliged to make legal demand upon her husband
for maintenance. The agreement which she had
signed, however, rendered several such applica-
tions futile ; and when at last she did obtain an
order for a weekly sum, it was appealed against
and quashed on the ground that, instead of
setting forth that she had “insufficient means
of support,” her application stated that she
had none. But the Judge who found him-
self thus compelled by the letter of the
statute to do a preposterously unjust thing,
expressed his opinion of the transaction in terms
Which appear to have decided Butler upon making
an effort to effectually throw his unfortunate wife
upon her own resources. Through a third party,
he opened negotiations for the reconciliation
which, for her children’s sake but to her own
desperate misfortune, Mrs. Butler was only too
ready to make. The abominable plot which has
since been exposed and punished was imme-
diately set on foot. Davis and the woman
Peake were employed by Butler to compro-
mise of his wife; and, only 14 days after the
“reconciliation,” Butler’s tool, Davis, having
pestered Mrs. Butler with his attentions for some
days previously, intruded himself upon her in her
house at a time when, by preconcerted arrange-
ment, Butler was to bring a fourth person to the
house to serve as an independent witness on the
accusation of adultery with which it was intended
to support the application for divorce.
The suit, possibly on the advice of the
lawyer who had advised Butler to the mainten-
ance-order appeal, was instituted in forma
pauperis, thus depriving Mrs. Butler—should she
be successful in having the divorce refused—of any
chance of costs. But, so far was she from being
successful, that, in addition to the disgrace and
agony of being publicly declared an adulteress, this
monumentally unfortunate woman had to endure
the conviction for perjury of a brother who had,
as there is now ample evidence to prove, told,
in his sister’s behalf, no more than the exact truth.
Before matters had reached this point, however,
Mrs. Butler had been obliged, first, to part with
her little remaining furniture, and nearly all her
personal apparel, and then to apply to the Bene-
volent Asylum for the bare means of subsistence
for herself and children.
It was at this stage that private-inquiry-agent
Cooke, so frequently mentioned in connection
with the divorce proceedings, undertook gratui-
tously—not, as Mrs. Butler desired, the establish-
ment of her brother's innocence—but the neces-
sary preliminary of proving collusion with regard
to the charge of adultery which had been made
against her.
To such good use did Cooke put the few days at
his disposal that, within two hours of the expiry
of the six months required to make absolute*the
rule nisi against Mrs. Butler, she was enabled to
file affidavits affirming Williams, who was sup-
posed to have been her partner in guilt, to be
identical with the man Davis, employed by Butler
to obtain or manufacture evidence against his
wife. Answering affidavits were, of course, filed,
to which Mrs. Butler, thanks to the good nature
and energy of Cooke, was prepared with such
crushing rejoinders that Davis and the woman
Peake were forthwith arrested on the conspiracy
charge. It was at this stage that attorney P. H.
Sullivan generously took the place, gratuitously,
of the fifth solicitor who had, in default of
the quid pro quo, “ chucked up ” the wretched and
unprofitable Mrs. Butler.
After some trouble, Davis and Peake were,
upon evidence raked together by Cooke, committed
for trial, but even then the Crown, for once, dis-
played a reluctance to prosecute, which resulted
in a postponement of the trial for two months.
The actual reason for this unwillingness to move
in the matter was, The Bulletin happens to
know, a very different one from that pressure of
railway-accident-actions which was officially
assigned as the cause. Butler himself was subse-
quently associated with his two tools in the con-
spiracy-indictment, with the result that all three
received severe, and, in public opinion, richly-
merited, sentences.
Her own innocence and the worthlessness
of her husband having thus been practically estab-
lished, Mrs. Butler was simple enough to suppose,
not only that she would immediately receive
custody of her children, but even that her brother
would forthwith be allowed to walk out of gaol as
an innocent man. Butler, however, had vindic-
tively arranged matters so that what money and
property he possessed should never reach his wife,
who is thus, owing to want of means to complete
the necessary legal formalities, not yet in lawful
possession of her own children ! while her brother,
nearly three weeks after the application for his
release, is still awaiting in gaol the termination of
the orthodox official fooling over a plain case.
The conviction for perjury of this young man,
John Johnson byname, was based chiefly on the
assumption that his evidence, as to an act of
adultery on Butler’s own part, had been concocted
to serve his sister’s purpose in the divorce pro-
ceedings. And yet another powerful testimony
to the necessity for a Public Defender is supplied
by the disgraceful fact that, at Johnson’s trial,
there was not brought forward a tittle of the
overwhelming evidence in his favor since
got together by private - detective Cooke —
amongst which are statutory declarations by two
reputable persons, strangers to each other, that
Johnson had spoken to them individually of
Butler’s adultery nearly a year before the divorce-
proceedings in connection with which he was
assumed by the prosecution to have invented the
story. These declarations, amongst others of
equal weight, are now in the hands of the Crown,
ami yet it appears doubtful whether Johnson,
who is only 20 years old, and who has almost com-
pleted his preliminary nine months of solitary
confinement, will be released, after all, in time to
leave it in his power to say that he, as an inno-
cent man, had not been compelled to herd with
hardened and professional criminals.
It is not surprising, in these circumstances, that
there is being developed for Mrs. Butler a wide-
spread public sympathy, wliich it is to be hoped
will speedily assume practical form by relieving
her from the undeserved penury that lias, during
the past terrible two years, reduced her at times
to extremities which more than justify the heading
of this article.
A fund in aid of Mrs. Butjer has been opened
by Sydney Daily Telegraph, to which The Bul-
letin cordially invites its readers to send even the
smallest sums.

“ Gentleman Joe,” at Sydney Lyceum, is
one of the most morally innocuous of the bowel-
less, gilded phantasmagorias set up by the Gee-
Gees. There isn’t a line in it that a young girl
may not repeat to her maiden aunt, and the most
lurid patch in the show was a copy of the
scurrilous Bulletin, which Mrs. Ralli-Carr left
unconvincingly lying loose in her front garden.
The baseless fabric of a dream, set to hard-boiled
music, about diagnoses “Gentleman Joe,” which
went to show that, after all, it is a great advantage
to see the piece played in Lunnon. Lewis Brad-
field, in tile little rdle, was a sadder and wiser
Brad field than heretofore; his wildly-cheeked suit
seemed to put a check upon his “bucking-up”
abilities (seen at their zenith “In Town ”); and
his “ business ” appears to come about as naturally
to him as whiskers on a duek-egg. It may
be that the long season had something to
do with the deadly silence of Bradfield’s delirious
legs, and the entire absence of anything like
gagging or unconsidered by-play. As a purely
amthor-inspired performance on the part of the
first funny man, Bradfield’s rendering of Joseph
Myrtle deserves preserving as a curio. It is so
rare to get the author-johnnie “ straight ” in a
Gee-Gee show.
• • «
The plot is, briefly, that a hansom cabby is
mistaken for a, lord by a society chaperone (Miss
Palotta), who discovers her error outside a bathing-
machine, whereupon she ought to apologise in her
best manner but doesn’t, and hands over the girl
in the intoxicated head-gear and the draught-
board upper tackling to the real lord (Charles
Kyley), who has come into a fortune. Meanwhile
Maud' Hobson, as Miss Du Potts, described as an
American but cleverly disguising the fact in good
Criterion-bar English, is left looking out for
another peer when the curtain falls; and the cab-
man is last seen walking off to the altar with the
maid (Decima Moore); while Fred Kaye (Mr.
Jones) is observed to be counting his daughters,
in the hope that one will turn up missing.
The music of "Gentleman Joe” contains one or
two hummable things—Decima Moore’s Puritan
ballad, for instance, which suits her to the very
shoelaces; Fred Kaye’s ‘‘Captain and Mermaid”
song, which suggests a smoke-concert item with
its tail docked ; ‘‘ln my Hansom,” with encore
verse embalming Max O’Rell’s ‘‘Cabs with the
blinds down ” historiette, sung by Bradfield, and
cackled over delightedly by the cold-shoulder
brigade, as if they rather revelled in the crude im-
peachment. Grace Palotta hasn’t a song to suit
her peculiar style, but Maud Hobson has a chance
with “That’s Me,” and makes the most of it. But
why Blanche Massey should be given the centre
of the stage and the orchestra all to herself to
piteously pipe a flabby little song about Love
being something or other is either a mystery or
the clever trick of a stage-rival. The weak point
of “ Gentleman Joe ” is Madge Rossell’s dancing
—there isn’t half enough of it. Phil Goateher’s
scenery is charming—especially the beach at Mar-
gate.
** * *
Not as the sands of the seashore for multi-
tude was the audience that assembled, on Satur-
day night last, to make acquaintance with George
Joseph Rignold of Canaan, though the “well-
known Biblical story” was mounted and staged
with a glittering magnificence that should have
carried on its back a much more cripply play than
the attractive drama which Parson George Walters
has evolved from the family history of Jacob and
Sons. Half-a-dozen members of that eminent firm
of pastoralists are discovered when the curtain
goes up, bemoaning the bad outlook for stock, in
a scene of such convincing aridity that The Bul-
letin was prematurely seized with the desire to
rush out and have a drink. But, finding out that,
between the prologue and the first act, eight solid
years would be available for that purpose, it suc-
cessfully restrained itself until Miss Lena Braseh,
as a small, preliminary Joseph, had been satis-
factorily disposed of for 20 pieces of silver —say,
Jil sterling—to a highly-revpectable foreigner,
attired in a spear and a clean nightgown.
• • •
Having duly dived beneath the aforesaid
eight years, the slim and silvery Joseph of the
prologue comes to the surface again as a substan-
tial middle-aged person, with a sleek humility of
demeanour which strongly suggests the possibility
that the original Mrs. Potiphar story was correct
after all ! The audience, however, has reason to
be thankful that to this offensively lowly indivi-
dual an extremely copper-coloured Potiphar com-
mits a delicate mission to On, the priests of which
place are suspected of being, politically, a bit Off,
as otherwise it would miss, in the Osirian
temple-scene, as weirdly splendid a spectacle as
Gorgeous George has ever staged. The Dance of
the Rising Sun, also, is a blessed and beautiful
circumstance, in connection with which it is
pleasant to record the entire coincidence of this
paper’s taste in pretty girls with that of the holy
men of On.
• « •
Miss Maud Williamson, as the vigorously
seductive Mrs. Potiphar, worked the temptation-
scene so artistically up to white-heat that The B.
began to fear it would never have successfully
enacted the part of Joseph, of whom, in this
instance, it has only to observe that he was com-
mendably less melodramatically Rignoldesque
than usual. J. W. Hazlitt played a good Plain-
Bill-Potiphar sort of part, and the strident Scott-
Inglis, as Ata, supplied the sound and reliable
kind of villain that is always eventually discour-
aged with a knife, or a pistol, or a thick stick.
Harry Plimmer’s Pharoah was an alert and busi-
ness-like monarch, and the Brethren bore up as
well as could be expected under the weight of
commercial depression and 11 brothers a-pieoe.
Mr. John Bruuton was screeched and whistled to
the front with every fresh scene, and at the end of
the third act the author had to be violently torn
from his shell to let the audience behold in the
flesh the parson who had actually acknowledged
that the clerical cadger takes the cake for “ front,”
and that the best card in the priestly pack is the
superstitious weakness of woman. People who
have been choked-off Joseph by a fear of a flap-
doodle combination of stage and Sunday-school
are so certain to find out their mistake that that
vicissitudinous person will probably continue for
some time to be thrown down a hole and pulled
out again and sold and promoted and maligned
and gaoled and exculpated and glorified.
** * *
The Empire co. make strides as public
entertainers; and, this week, half-a-dozen old
favorites, are back to strengthen the per-
formance, which now goes with a rattle. Syd-
ney has every reason to be satisfied with
her variety-shows. What is wanted now is a
theatre specially-built to accommodate them, on
the London or Paris music-hall plan, with
ample promenade, ladies’ room, handy refresh-
ments, and plenty of space to smoke and
chatter at intervals. At present, the audi-
ence has to choose between the discomfort of
sitting still throughout the performance and the
equal discomfort of stumbling over a score of
knees on the way through a dim passage to a dirty
pavement. The first theatrical manager with
money and brains enough to erect a Folies-
Bergeres in Sydney and Melbourne will never live
to regret it.
• • «
The pleasures of the promenade entertain-
ment are hardly yet realised in Australia, but that
the public only want a little encouragement is
evidenced by the good attendance on the first
night of Sydney Town Hall Monday Pops.
Monday’s programme, however, can easily be im-
proved on, especially if the promoter makes his
co. rehearse concerted pieces, and brings them on
in chorus as often as possible. One man or woman
on the Town Hall stage, unless a top-notcher,
doesn’t make much impression, and a few
trios or quartettes would liven things up
considerably. There is an excellent, little
orchestra under Sig. Podenzana, and the talent,
though familiar, is capable enough. The
hero of the evening (not altogether from a
musical point of view) was Mons. Napoleon
Botfard, a tenor all the way from Paris, who sang
a fantasia on “Faust” which hashed up pretty
nearly every notable melody in the opera. Luckily,
the audience wanted the music and wasn’t par-
ticular about the words, and the.mixture was quite
successful. Miss Baber, Miss Galvin, and Messrs.
Weir, Farley, and Hallewell, also contributed suc-
cessfully ; and when the “sentiment-evenings”
come into swing the concerts will probably begin
to gee,
•# * *
“ Does death end all ? ” was the question
wrested with in his first Centenary Hall lecture
by Rev, Joe Cook (from Bosting, in ’Murka)—
with the inevitable result that Joseph got badly
thrown. Joseph is as cocksure as of yore, and
prances as proudly ns aforetime around the same
old circle of gratuitous assumptions in which who-
soever believeth not shall be damned. Also, lie
sets up, in the same old row, the same old polemical
men of straw, in order that he may promptly
punch them all down again, to the glory of the
Lord and the delectation of the faithful. The
proving, “from conscience, physiology, and revela-
tion,” that death is no extinguisher—was the
small contract in connection with which the
“eminent philosopher and scientist” forgot to
explain why he was playing it so low down on the
Almighty as to assume that revelation doesn’t fill
the bill, or why anybody who thinks he has God’s
guarantee for a post-mortem existence should
require the supplementary assurances of Joe
Cook !
* * •
Cook besides being controversially a
question-begger of unparalleled audacity, even for
a parson—is oratorically a ghastly exemplar of
that Yankee fondness for fustian, which has
diverted so much tolerable pulpit-talent into
the channels of third-class low comedy. In his
grinnings, and growlings, and bowlings, and
hurryings, and slowings, and sudden boundings
over lofty brinks of falsetto into awful chasms of
melo-dramatic profundity—Cook is but. a badly
Bowdlerised version of the boss-bunkumite, of
whose gruesome climacteric screech Joe has evi-
dently made reverent and careful study. But he
hasn’t mouth enough to quite get there! The
Talmagean oral abyss is the sort of thing that
is seen but once in a century.
» » •
“A law of nature," bellowed Joseph, “is
not its own explanation!” Neither is Cook !
The explanation of Cook is that, while he is a
skilful shirker of all such bold, bad questions as
would be asked by the mere sons of Belial, he is a
glib purveyor of mild argumentative pap to the
holy and weak-witted audiences who sit at bis
feet to he convinced once more of what they never
had mental backbone enough to question.
** * *
Elton’s success with “The Guv’nor,” at
Sydney Criterion, augurs brightly for the blas6
Hampden’s popularity, and if his coming Excel-
lency gets his foot as firmly in the stirrup of public
affection as his namesake comedy does, he .will be
a rose-crowned potentate going away. The
comedy goes equally well by morning or evening
light, on land or water, and the amphibious parts
of it are nicely balanced by the artistic sumdried
appearance of the garden-wall over which Frank
Emery pops his malignant countenance in a
manner suggestive of Mrs. Nickelby’s lover. No
change of bill is, as yet, announced, though there
is lots of change in the treasury.
** * *
Mark Twain, who has been delayed a
week or so by the recent accident to the VVarri-
moo,. is due in Sydney about the middle of Sep-
tember, by which time that other humorist, Holy
Joe Cook, of Boston, will have moved on and left
the track clear.
** * *
Johann Kruse will give his first Sydney
concert in the Centenary Hall on Saturday
evening. He will be assisted by Madame Elise
Wiedermann (soprano), Signor De Beaupuis
(pianist), and Herr Hattenbach (violoncellist), all
new to Sydney.

Melbourne saw the last of Miss Olliffe in a
pathetic realisation of Paula Tanqueray, a per-
formance so much finer than her previous best in
the same character, or any other character, that it
astounded her admirers. On Friday night Mrs.
Tanqueray lived and suffered through the third
and fourth chapters of Pinero’s story. The part
played the actress, not the actress the part.
When Miss Noble reported the suicide of her
step-mother there must have been many people
present who felt that Mrs. Tanqueray was dead
to them, and regretfully hung her portrait, by
Geraldine Olliffe, in their gallery of recollections,
not far from Sarah Bernhardt’s famous Camille.
** * *
On Saturday, the W. and M. opera co.
re-appeared at the Princess’s, bringing a rush of
business with them. “Madame Angot” is not
nowadays a very attractive show, as a rule, but
this occasion had a particular charm for the
Chosen in the form of Miss Juliet Flegeltaub
Wray. Bookmakers, flushed with their recent
victory over the tote, came in force to see the can-
didate win, and, if racial sentiment were popular
opinion, Miss Wray would have to be accepted as
Nellie Stewart’s legitimate successor. The truth
(Hebrew and Gentile) re this clever and energetic
aspirant is bound to prevail presently, so it may
as well be stated now. The damsel’s long experi-
ence as an amateur star has furnished her with all
the confidence of a professional expert, both in
singing and acting, her enunciation is most distinct,
also her natural ability enables her to imitate
a finished artist in characters where “go ” is the
first essential. Miss Wray, who has caught same
of Nellie Stewart’s tricks of speech, is a pleasing
Olairette, in spite of her obvious wig, except When
she attempts to dance, or when the music exposes
her false singing method, and makes her warble
sound like a violin accompaniment. Clairettes of
all styles and qualities have invariably scored a
hit with the riotous ditty in the last act, but Miss
Wray’s success in this easy item was not more
notable than the failure of her wrangling duet
with Miss Florence Young, for which both ladies
were responsible. Thecrudbness of thenew “ prima
donna’s ” work, as a whole, would have been
quite apparent in a first-class show. This wasn’t
even good second-class form. “Madame Angot”
happens to be the W. and M. Coy.’s feeblest pro-

“Saved from the Sea” is slowly giving
way under the burden of utter foolishness at
Melb. Royal. The gallows drop which refuses to
send Walter Baker to his doom, the craven villain
who shrinks from an assassination of Miss Wat-
son, likewise the mad mariner with a strange
objection to berlud, and the unique expanse of
rolling sea, must all be withdrawn after Friday
night. It seems that certain Bulletin allusions
to a waste of vittles at Bland Holt’s picnic were
uncalled for, since they only applied to one parti-
cular occasion when the company were off their
feed. In the ordinary way five mutton chops and
a roast chicken are religiously “ scoffed ” upon the
stage, whilst a fine volume of malt liquor dis-
appears from view. And yet the end of this
satisfying drama has arrived so soon. On Satur-
day, the co. reverts to “The Prodigal Daughter,”
who will play the season to a close.

Stevens and Howells’ new concert com-
pany is mainly a shock-headed youth of uncertain
age who inflicts awful castigations upon a grand
piano. There are but three imported stars in the
oo— two young lady vocalists and the queer
apparition aforesaid. One of the ladies is a satis-
factory dramatic contralto, shaped accordingly,
and the other, Miss Evangeline Florence, a tall,
slender soprano with a voice to match. She soars
very high on a light wing, but although a more
fully cultivated singer than the Lalla Miranda
whom Australia knew, Miss Florence is not as
birdlike as that fluent little warbler.

Mark Hamhourg, the Russian pianist,
seems a somewhat unique example of “ flashness ’’
in youthful art. He burst forth some years ago
as a juvenile prodigy, and can’t have grown much
since. He would be very short if he got his hair
cut; also, he appears upon the platform in a short
coat, and lie sits upon the margin of his chair, as
though abashed hy the piano’s presence. That’s
duplicity on Mark’s part. Suddenly he raises
both hands against the instrument, in the manner
of an angry ’Arriet who has caught another girl
fondling her chap ; then he sets about clawing
and punching the keys at a great rate. Some-
times, when baffled in ten consecutive attempts to
tear ’em all up by the roots, little Mark will pause
m instant and glare at his adversary before
resuming the battle with redoubled fury.
He’s a hurricane pug. with Tartar blood
in him, is Mark, and a wonderfully clever
tighter, too. He makes no mistakes. Mark
always gets right home on ten spots at once.
Mvery blow tells! "His performance may, or may
not, be magnificent from the composer’s point of
view, but it’s war— e’est la guerre. Naturally,
there is a certain sameness in the results of these
remorseless campaigns. Under Mark’s treatment
a Schumann slumber-song is calculated to make
any sick person, at the furthest end of the hall, sit
up. He was sent into our world to wake the dead
rather than to soothe weary souls in the reserved
seats. Nevertheless, he is a fine pianist of his
kind. , K

At Sydney Tivoli last Saturday there was
much singing, much beauty, much glitter, much
high color, Fannap’s mouth, clever silhouettes,
smart jmrgling and acrobatic feats, and a bumper

As the smallest spark remaining might start the
Broken Hill mine fire again the expensive precautions
have to be continued. The only way to find out for cer-

Export of ore from the Central’(B.H.) has in-
creased much since the sale of the mine to the Frevven
syndicate was authorised, but the quality is not high, and
anticipations regarding the earnings of the 00. during the
period of grace before the syndicate takes over Hie pro-
perly will scarcely be realised. The kaolin develop-
ment —which almost upset the sale—has been patchy
and disappointing.
♦ • ♦ •
Mon at Broken Hill still dispute as to whether
the fire in Block 11 is out or not. Over a fortnight ago
the manager reported that it was, yet other practical men
doubt it; and all the time they continue to force down
carbonic acid gas. The difficulty is that there are timbers
above the level of the bottom of the quarry or open-cut
and thnt the gas, being heavier than atmospheric air’
cannot reach these upper timbers, as it escapes through
the vents nt the bottom of the quarry. If there is fire
anywhere, it is in these uppermost timbers. Of course
, though the gas cannot reach these, it can and does
prevent any downward spread of the smouldering. One
man who really deserves credit for what lie has done
during this trouble is Capt. Warren, manager of Block 10,
not so much for keeping the fire out of his mine as for
keeping the gas out.
The treatment of Broken Hill sulphide ore is
already much more extensive than is generally thought.
Hardly less than 5000 tons is dealt with weekly. The
South concentrates slightly over 1000 tons, and ships the
material to Europe. The Junction treats 500 tons and
sells the product, part to Drj’ Creek and part for ship-
ment. Block 14 deals with 1400 tons, sending the product
to its Adelaide furnaces. Block 10 concentrates 500 tons,
and sells the product for shipment. Wills and Co. are the
chief buyers for shipping; the material is bagged and
used largely for “stiffening'.” Block 10 also ships up to
650 tons crude ore weekly ; and the Junction and other
mines as much more. Then over 1000 tons is smelted
locally, mixed with other ores ; making up the 5000 tons.
Six months hence the output should he over 8000 tons per
week. This for the special enlightenment of those who
think sulphide treatment still entirely a problem.
Offers for Block 10 sulphides—thought to be the
most refractory at Broken Hill —continue to come from
many quarters. So far, however, the parcels sought for
are only of experimental size.
* * • *
Why don’t the shareholders in the Pinnacles
(Br ken Hill, N.S.W.) stir up the directors? In the light
of H'e experim“iits and works at Broken Hill for sulphide
treatment something might be done with the admittedly
refractory Pinnacles ore, of which there is an enormous
quantity. Instead, only just enough men are maintained
on tribute to hold the ground, the lower levels continue
flooded, and nothing he| ter than pig-rooting is being done
in the upper levels. Worse still, valuable portions of the
concentrating plant are being sold to the B.H. companies.
Only last week two huddles were thus disposed of to the
Junction. There has been more than one semi-scandal in
connection with this group of mines at the Pinnacles, and
it almost seems as if another is developing.

of course, the Rothschilds are going to float it. Water-

So a new “lode” has been found at the SOft.
level of the Drysdale Proprietary! For “lode” read
“deposit.” When N.S.W. Govt. Geologist Jnques was
examining the field last year, writes a BULLETIN corres-
pondent from the field, he roared at the idea of any
“lode” exi-ting at all. “One man, speaking of this
apocryphal lode, told the,” he said, “ she dips down here
and comes up ah"Ut a mile north near the Coronga
Downs fence, slap in the middle of my claim." Mr.
Jnques says: “There isn't any lode at all—only a series
of deposits thrown here and there at haphazard. There
is no reef, vein, or lode—why, you can’t, tell till you have
washed it whether the stone being raised carries gold or
not.” Which is a fact, the Drysdale manager washing
two prospects daily to see if they are still on gold —though
it doesn’t alter the other fact that thousands of ounces
have been raised from the claim.
Apropos, No. 1 Drysdale shaft, although the
lowest of the three, is still perehed up on the side of the
hill. Dr> sdale Proprietary is down on the flat at the
font. Still the latter say; “The new lode in Drysdale at
86ft. level is (tearing westerly, and we expect to cut. it
after sinking another 166 ff.” How can they do this
unless it d ; ps almost vertically ? Who sends those wires
to S.M. Herald ?

Mt. Lewison, Pambula, after a long spell of
indifferent luck, has again struck good gold in its fissure

be better managed than the last.

From a Bulletin correspondent in London;
“The Morgan (promoted by Pritchard Morgan, once a
N.Q. attorney and mining speculator, now a member of
the Commons), and other gold-mines in Wales, are
yielding very handsome profits, and new mines of great
richness are being discovered. The London people, as a
rule, will only deal with practical mining men. Some of
the miners from Coolgardie, in little better than a miner’s
suit of clothes, floated their affairs without trouble, while
other properties failed to be moved by Australian M.P.’s
and office men. The Morgan mine, in North Wales, paid
a £5600 div. in May, and crushed a little bonanza of
3 tons 12 owts., yielding at the rate of 400 oz. per ton.
The last 10,000 tons crushed 12dwts. of standard gold !
They crush by water-power; the cost of raising and
crushing is only 6s. 6d. per ton ; the best miners only
getting 4s. per day.
“ The Morgan mine is situated on the river
Mwddach(or something like that) between Dolgelly and
Barmouth, the port at the mouth of the river noted for
its beauty. It, is aim near Mount Cdderwidderiddwerr—
(humanely called ‘Gadder’ for short).”

Col. North, it is said, sold in Paris 40,000 Lon-

thing by buying at 10s. a large number of shares given
for adjoining properties, so that he can keep Ins promise
to the victims in returning to the < o. the vendors’ shares
he received as his profit in the float.

A very well-known mining man recently in
W.A., now in London, writes to The Bulletin:
“ VVestralians are looking up a little, on account
of the Great Boulder output. It seems as if they were
gel ting ready for a small boom. You would be surprised
to see how little is really being Hone in W.A. wild cats.
You.can sell shares in hut few mines, and you io tld not

dence of the sick condition of the mine. The Colonel
appears to maintain that the damnatory cable sent by
Fingall should not have been published, as it really re.

they erred, erred on the side of horn sly and candor.

Several cool-headed mining men, including Capt. Vaudrv,
have described the Boulder as one of the greatest gold-
mines of the world, and advised their friends to buy up
to £3 or £4 a share, and ns its richness came with a rush

Average sample Coolgardie wire: “The crush-
ing at the Croesus mine was somewhat, disappointing, the

a yarn of what the manager did in this Instance to show
thnt the crushing was not, a fair average. The public
have Dug grown w aned of mining excuses. Why only
8 tons? And if the mine has better stone, why not crush
100 tons to prove it ?
Agitation already started to extend Coolgardie

Editor Bulletin, —As an original shareholder

As a practical business man, 1 advocate that a committee
of shareholders he appointed to take stock of new plant
and workings, and obtain a report from an expert
master engineer ; so endeavoring to restore confidence
in the mine and market. No non-mechanical man used
to mining plants can understand the losses which have
been sustained through the hoard of directors not hav ! ng

done elsewhere.—Yours, &c., James Farr ant, Launces-

Q. Mines Under-Secretary Sellheim, in his
annual report, complains of the shameful mismanage-

machinery was landed for one mine and lay idle on the

Heaps of old iron and machinery, representing many
thousands of pounds, lie rolling about most Northern
mining properties. On the Etheridge it is calculated
that something like a million of English money has been
spent, and hardly a shaft is down below 400 ft.

That Curse Again.
The idea that murderer Deeming’s autobiography
was altogether too dreadful for publication and
had therefore been destroyed, is altogether
erroneous. And thereby hangs a tale. From the
day of Deeming’s arrival in custody at Melbourne
right up to his trial he did little else but write the
story of his life. This information duly reached
England, and soon the London City Press Agency
cabled out to Marshall Lyle asking how much he
would take for Deeming’s story. More in the
spirit of levity'than of business Mr. Lyle replied
“ .£1000,” and was astonished at the immediate
acceptance of his terms and the cablimr to a Melb.
bank of .£looo to be paid over on delivery of the
certified complete autobiography. Thus encour*
aged, the solicitor set no limit to expense in
preparing the defence, on which he altogether
spent about £4OO. A couple of days before the
trial ten chapters of the autobiography were in
the hands of Marshall Lyle; but it was just here
that the Curse of Deeming took a hand. On the
first day of the trial Deeming said through the
bars of the dock to his solicitor: “There are
some names omitted in that last chapter; let me
have it again and I will fill them in.” Thereupon
Lyle left the court and returned with the
chapter required, which, at the close of the day,
was returned to him by the author. Gaoler Foy
(since dead, the Curse having marked him) saw
prisoner hand back the papers, and at once re-
minded the warder on duty that a breach had
been committed of the special and, in some re-
spects, unwarrantable precautions ordered to be
observed during the trial ; it having been laid
down that no document was to pass from Deeming
to anybody in Court, without having been first
submitted to Foy. The Warder represented the
situation to Marshall Lyle, who, upon receiving
Foy’s solemn assurance that the MS. would be
returned him next day, handed it in. But it was
not returned to him next day, nor upon any other
day. The gaol officials put Lyle off till after the
trial, when the matter came within the province
of the sheriff, who referred the solicitor to the
Chief Secretary. It was then ascertained that the
misappropriated manuscript had been submitted
to a Cabinet meeting, whence it had been borne
off in the coat-tail pocket of Premier Shiels, who,
when implored to return the important papers to
their rightful owner, at first seemed to convey the
impression that they had been destroyed, but
afterwards argued that it was his duty to with-
hold them from publication. Shortly aiterwards,
the City Press Agency cabled that, the contract
not having been complied with, it must be con-
sidered cancelled. Thus was Marshall Lyle
diddled out of the only substantial means avail-
able to pay for his work, and the other expenses
incurred. It subsequently transpired that the
contents of the historical tenth chapter were too
much for the authorities. Deeming had filled it
with gorgeous details of his alleged hob-
nobbing with the Wilsons at Tranby Croft,
the scene of the celebrated baccarat episode.
“ I just ' missed meeting the Prince of
Wales,” wrote Deeming, “by the merest chance.
He arrived a fortnight after I left.” Other
familiar and flippant remarks about "Royalty
decided Shiels to treat the question of re‘t irin(f
the MS. as an affair of State, and he submitted it
to Gov. Hopetoun, who (reckless of the Curse)
promptly decided that the dreadful writings
should be suppressed— i.e., retained by himself to
be shown around amongst his friends. The Curse
fell on Shiels swiftly and heavily. His Ministry
was soon thrown out; he has since been poli-
tically shelved ; and it is said that his health U
permanently shattered.

Mr. Justice Simpson (N.S.W.) lias been
doing divorce work lately. When he is sitting it
is not so easy to get unhitched. In the first place,
his Honor is and always has been an opponent of
the easy-divorce system ; and, secondly, he is
judicially deliberate and cannot be induced to
race. If a certain contingency should occur, Judge
Simpson will be the very man for divorce.
* £ #
According to Judge Simpson, habitual
drunkenness alone is not, in N.S. Wales, a
ground for divorce. In the case of a wife there
must be habitual drunkenness for three years,
accompanied by a neglect of domestic duties. But
Photo. by Yeoman.
JOHE JOHNSTON, Mrs. Butler’s brother,
sentenced to three years’ for alleged perjury, but
now believed to be perfectly innocent.
the mere fact of a wife’s continual drunkenness
implies neglect of domestic duties, inasmuch as
part of her duty surely is to make herself
tolerable to her husband, and not to chronically
smell of rum. If she does chronically smell of
rum and her husband dislikes the smell of rum,
she is emphatically neglecting her domestic duties.
The drunkenness of the wife involves cruelty to
the husband, and is, or ought to be, good ground
for divorce.
This is how the Cholly
boy in Sydney told it ;
“Yaas. I only had thwip-

Most, if not all, of the
de-nominations have now, in
Melbourne, special charitable
organisations connected with
them ; and to their credit be
it said that Protestant, Catho-
lic. Jew, or heathen, is wel-
comed by any one of them
without question of creed. It
is sufficient that an applicant
is in want. Such methods
show a spirit of liberalism con-
spicuously absent from the
churches’ dealings with Poor
Persons not so long ago, when,
to secure relief, the being a
member, or at least a catechumen, of a particular
sect was a sine qua non.
Melb. Medical Faculty wanted to make
the women students dissect in the same room with
the men. But the women kicked, and induced
the University Council to reverse the order of the

of joy. Nearly all aboard are more or

Dear Bulletin, — Referring to a
recent competition in definitions of
“Woman Up to Date,” I beg to for-
ward a few for your contempt : 1. An
earnest exponent of erotic eccentrici-
ties. 2. An arrogant apostle of ap-
palling aridities. 3. A preposterous
pioneer of pernicious propensities. 4.
A vituperative vixen of vulgar and
vicious vagaries. 5. A morbid mischief-
maker among maudlin mediocrities, —
Yours faithfully, An Asinine Aspiran .
eor Alliterative Achievements.

In Australia nowadays the young
man who has nothing better to do
studies for a profession, and having
gained it still has nothing better to do.
Surveying has been done to death;
barristers and solicitors, whose best
resource now is an occasional black-mail
libel-action, live in the hope of one day
eating one another ; as for physic—well,
the average doctor is not now making
£3OO a year, and many are half-starved.
The newest professional craze is den-
tistry, and several footballers have
gone to Europe and America to learn
this art, despite the fact that either one
of their hands will catch a football as
Borafortably as an ordinary hand will
catch a marble. Imagine a man with
hands big and strong enough to pull
"Ihe horns out of a bull manipulating
in the dentist-chair the slender jaw of
another man’s very best girl !
The ethics of missionary enterprise are
beyond mortal comprehension. The late massacres
in China remind The Bulletin that it knows a
lady, perfectly sincere and honest, who is at
present a missionary in the Flowery Kingdom.
Aforesaid lady owns a considerable part of a
Queensland plantation, cultivated by some of the
most barbarous heathen in the Southern hemis-
phere. But the heathen at home is always a
negligeable factor, as witness the state of Sydney
ind Melbourne slums.

Kew and Hawthorn are the headquarters
of the Vic. Chinese missionary, and many local
Sunday-school young ladies have classes of Chows,
some of whom are coming on rapidly. The
Bulletin advises the fathers and brothers of such
young ladies to read the back files of the ’Frisco
papers re the guileless Sunday-school miss and her
soulful pupil—the fascinating Chow. When the
Kew and Hawthorn men have acquainted them-
selves with this subject, they will shoot their
sisters rather than let them run the risk.

ordinary suspected cit.
A male witness in a particularly disgusting
Melb. case was accused of having tampered with
another witness (female), but was held guiltless
because said witness, a young girl, was such an
unmitigated and vigorous liar that it would be
scandalous to commit a cat on her evidence.

Judge Hood, dropping the charge, informed
accused impressively “ that he was a remarkably
lucky man in having such a witness as the girl
against him.” Certainly—the man was lucky in
having to contend with such a transparent liar.
The female perjurer is often too opaque for the
average Judge to see through her at a glance, and
then accused invariably gets hung or is flayed by
the Govt, man-butcher ; but had this particular
damsel not been the kind of damsel she was, the
man might not have been called upon to defend
himself against such a charge. Justice Hood
seems to consider it logical to believe the accusa-
tions of a ground and lofty liar while disbelieving
her testimony.

Adelaide W.C.T.U. has resolved on moving
to have choirmasters added “to guardians,

accounts for the exclusion of the latter from the

This time the stipendiary beak, Thomas
Dobson was sued at Melbourne for trespass, and
Thomas proved that he had entered the establish-
ment of complainant to draw wages allegedly due.
The money was not paid, and he sat down, saying
he would camp till it was paid ; whereupon his
employer had him arrested for trespass. The
P.M. imposed a fine of Is., to the disgust of other
magistrates, who held that defendant was justi-
fied. Then spake his Worship: “But if a
fine is not inflicted accused may take action
against prosecutor.” The fine ivas inflicted. So

The other day, at Charters Towers, a
Chinese was charged with using obscene language.
The offence was clearly proved, and defendant

St. Kilda (Melb.) Council, lately headed
by a cheap, teetotal Mayor, deposed the cold-
water magnate the other day, with great rejoicing,
and elected a man who is willing to infuse spirits
into the municipal proceedings. The late Mayor
accepted the position without an allowance, it
being understood that during Ids reign councillors
would refresh themselves at a filter in the Mayor s
room. This arrangement appears to have cast a
dense gloom over the council, which, after long
suffering from a thick rust on its tongue, at
last set up a cellar on its own account, ihe
retiring Mayor offered himself for re-election on
the old terms, but the council howled and elected
Or. Lemme, who takes a subsidy of .£l5O, and is
understood to be morally bound to irrigate coun-
cillors. Plainly put, St. Kilda councillors vote an
allowance of .£l5O of the borough money for a
grand annual year-long “ shout ” for themselves.
This is the same body which recently ‘‘much
regretted the necessitous circumstances that
compelled it to reduce the usual charity grant of
.£2OO. Whilst Demos neglects the councils,
councillors may be expected to take excellent care
of themselves.

Wesley Hall, Mountmorganaire (writes

A rich Australian in England who has just
hyphenated his name recently gave a big ball, and
it is said that out of his 600 guests he only knew
100. Invitations for men were knocking about
very freely, and one man had 30 blank cards to
distribute. This is how Anglo-Australians fill
their ball-and-supper rooms. According to Ids
enemies, the thrifty host does not give the best

accounts for the inferior sex being so difficult

Mr. Ryan, late of the Engineer’s depart-

uncommon experience of the courtesy of the
officials of the Imperial Institute, writes a Bul-
letin correspondent. Mr, Ryan (a Fellow of the
Institute) and his wife were visiting the Railway
Exhibition on the day the Prince of Wales was
there. He happened to pass close to where they
were, and they stood back a little so as not to be
too prominent. But they did not succeed _in
escaping the eagle eye of a jackanapes official,
who promptly had them turned out neck and
crop. Such conduct where a lady is concerned is
unpardonable; but it is only a specimen of what
may happen to a man who comes between Royalty
and the wind—at the Institute.

W. : Bulletin wondei’s whether it is
“unconscious cerebration or coincidence ” which
makes one of Arthur Morrison’s tales an exact
replica of the fate of the Perkins women in South
Melbourne. It is neither. The fact is that Mor-

cases are so common in this sweated world that
they are happening every day in every city. The
name is the only peculiar coincidence in the whole
thing.

The unfortunate Melbourne woman, Wil-
liams, who,confessed to having drowned her two-
year-old boy, said that she had “ tried to get him
into the Catholic Church Home, but, as he was
not a Catholic, they would not take him in.”
Yet the Protestant parsons, filled with “brotherly
love,” are constantly accusing the Romish authori-
ties of dark acts of proselytism. TheR.C. “push”
is thus between the Protestant devil and the deep
sea of infanticide. If they had taken in baby
Williams, Melbourne Protestantism would have
shrieked anathema; because they didn’t, the
mother drowned him like a redundant kitten,

Fate is inexorable. Young Prell, son of

lungs were weak, to go up to .the Northern
station. The morning after his arrival he was

drove the pointed stick he held through his chest.
His family now bewail the death they tried to
keep out of his way.

A man in Sydney Domain, last week, was
successfully garotted for “ tuppence” ! Which re-
calls a Brisbane instance, about 10 years ago,
when a man had his skull bashed in, and only
emerged from hospital three months afterwards, for
threepence. Again, some 20 years ago, a Brisbane
man was sentenced to five years’ “hard” for
stealing sixpence. This last indictment was made
one of “highway robbery,” the perpetrator, a
drunken fool, having “stuck up ” a nervous man
for “sixpence.” The “convict” served every
day of his awful sentence, too, excepting the
usual “ mitigation ” for “good conduct.”

Lawyers, writes a Bulletin correspond-
ent, are not the only persons who live on their
articled clerks. Melb. architects’ offices abound
in indentured unfortunates ; usual premiums,
from £lOO to .£2OO. Latterly one firm had six
articled clerks during one year ; three or four
were very common, and two the usual thing. No
salaries are paid while “serving time,” and, if ex-
ceptionally good, a clerk may, at the end of four
or five years, earn as draughtsman from £2 to £3
per week.

The interest in Cellular Clothing is be-

Cellular fabric is so large that it may be said to
cover every variety of clothing for all seasons and
for all climates. Since the doctors recommend it,
and since it gives the maximum warmth with the
minimum weight, and is therefore peculiarly suit-
able for Australian climates, it is not surprising
to find it quickly superseding the old materials
used for underclothing. The sole agents for the
colony of Victoria are Messrs. Hicks, Atkinson

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at*
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and now,'after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

Sydney Lyceum, attracted the usual dress-hat
house. The matinee didn’t strike me as being a
bright specimen of its class. Many of the music-
hall turns tucked in between the most «|>ortive
acts of “In Town,” “The Shop,” and “Gaiety ”
Girls, were a heap more irritating than the scene-
shifting rowdedovv they were run on to hide would
have been, and even the Gees-Gees weren’t beyond
making mistakes that afternoon. For instance,
when Madge Rossell and Kaye were doing that
exquisite Japanesque pas de deux of theirs in “The
Shop Girl,” the vision of little Decima Moore,
bundled up in a prosaic grandmotherly-looking
shawl, and landing at the wings in full view of
the audience, was an unnecessary exposure.
Another smile occurred when Ryley came forth
to sing “Sunlight Soap Above,” and the dazed
orchestra wildly hunted for the score for several
minutes while Mr. R. stood with his mouth open.
Then the Bombardos-Pataques duet between
Elton and Reilly was rendered a trifle incon-
gruous by the fighting-cock business eventuating
in front of a mild back set representing a morning
room with a modern clock on the mantelpiece. If
they had only thrown in a chimney, too, the
thing might have suggested belligerent Thomas
cats. The clock, and so on. by the way, had
served as background for Myra Kemble and
Monkhonse in “Wailing” (a piece with many
aliases) which was chiefly a success because it was
the vehicle for the re-appearance of the almost
resurrected Miss Kemble whom Australia lately
heard of as dying in London. Miss Kemble, in
a white brocade tea-gown with a petticoat of
yellow lace and knots of yellow ribbons, received
quite an ovation on her re-appearance via the jaws
of grim Death.
The migratory Comic Opera Co., which went on
to Melb. same day per express, were sprinkled
about the Lyceuin at the M. benefit. The Comic
Opera Co. had a gratifying success in Brisbane,
and look snappy after the fray. Flo. Young, at
the railway-station, was very smart in a tailor-
built travelling dre-s of fawn tweed and a
moderate bat, with Mrs. Lauri in neat tweed ami
a straw “sailor”—a pleasant contrast to the
appearance en route of some of the lollopy Gee-
Gee ladies who journey in fly-catcher veils,
flowers, frizz and other abominations. 1 caught a
glimpse of the athletic Wallace Brownlow and
George Lauri, too, both looking as bright as
buttons. I hear (apropos of the Comic Opera
Co.) that Flo. Young makes up Lord Clanside
the very double of “Sweet-Marie” Norrie (who
is rather a nice boy when released from a velvet
doublet), and is a great success in the part; and
that Miss Minnie Everett (a Pollard ex-liliputian,
who is to marry Willie Rice in Mellioiirne) made
quite a hit with a pas seal in the green-room scene
of “In Town.” One rejoices to hear of the suc-
cess of Australian talent.
N.S.W. Horticultural Society may congratulate
itself on its winter shows—a neat exhibition held
this time in York-street skating-rink, with after-
noon-tea gratis and stirring music as extra attrac-
tions, and the Acting-Governoress giving the
daffodils and orchids the advantage of a fashion-
able start in life on opening day. This has been
a season Of great depression in tbe kingdom of
vegetables—drought and frost playing havoc with
the green things—and so the small, though excel-
lent, display made by the H. Society is remark-
ably good considering the weather we’ve been
having lately.
Only two decorated tables competed, an ar-
rangement of daffodils and feathery leaves gaining
an easy first ; but I fail to see why the second
“ decorated ” table should have run into a place,
seeing that if there had been any sort of a third
vegetable on the lists it couldn’t have failed to
gain second prize from the winner thereof.
Because a prize is going begging the judges
shouldn’t give it away blindfold, as if it wouldn’t
keep for another time, and nobody of taste would
have given more than a groan at the violent
arrangement of snowdrops and holly—spring and
winter in collision —which that table displayed.
Other faultjr things in the decorative line were the
open fans with sprays and bunches of flowers on
them. This sort of thing is all right for palm-leaf
fans, but the open-and-shut variety are never
carried stiffly unfurled all the time (except by my
portrait at the prow of these remarks). The
orchid display was clever; only these grotesque
flowers, tliat want a Beardsley or a Japanese
Ethel Stephens to do them full justice artistically,
are so fulsomely gushed over by “ society ’’(which
would, in its heart, if it has a heart, just as soon
gaze on an onion) that one always hurries away
from their neighborhood.
Sydney University Dramatic Society, under
the able guidance of the veteran Charles Burford,
produced Sheridan’s fine old comedy “The
Rivals,” at Sydney Standard Theatre, last Wed-
nesday. Of course, the full bouquet de Sheridan
wasn’t apparent, the play having been discreetly
boned to suit the unpolluted minds of ’Varsity
students who are on winking terms with the
classics—but still the show succeeded, for it was
smartly acted, well-learnt, and handsomely
dressed. Nearly everybody mummed acceptably.
Mr. J. P. Pickburn, in red velvet, as Sir Anthony,
made all the points in the quarrelsome scene ; Mr.
J. H. Brearley was quite Bellewish as Captain
Absolute, in a howling uniform ; Mr. J. M‘Mahon,
wasSirLucius O’Trigger, with an unfaltering Irish
accent and a splendid suit of blue and silver;
Bob Acres (Mr. E. B. Dalton), reminded me
of Lydia (in “Dorothy ”) in the duel scene; Mr.
M. Logan, was Faulkland, in black and gold ;
and Mr. F. Copeland played the servant
lout like an artist. Among the ladies, Miss
Marie Langton made a hit with Mrs. Malaprop
her voice and method being startlingly like Mrs.
Brough’s at times ; and Miss Ackman infused a
lively sonbrette spirit into the part of Lucy. But
Julia and Lydia were badly cast. The languish-
ing Miss C. Roseby, of the somnolent articulation,
should have been the romantic die-away Lydia,
while the self-conscious Miss Hnngerford might
have played Julia without evoking bricks from
the audience. All the ladies wore becoming
period gowns, and the large audience applauded
the performers after every scene.
Sydney Suburban Bicycle Club and the Darling-
hurst Harriers are to be congratulated on achiev-
ing a very cosy hop at West’s Rooms last
Thursday, when athletes of all shades of opinion
whirled on the polished floor, the harriers having
the advantage over the wheelers as to pace. I was
surprised to see no “bikes” or spikey shoes among
the decorations, but otherwise all was well, for ball-
committees must not be blamed for the gaudy and
immutable trimmings which go with the 'all—and
the music was excellent. The company seemed
very evenly balanced —no wallflowers of either sex,
and some of the frocks proved very becoming.
The wife of one of the secretaries wove yellow silk
with chiffon sleeves and violets with good effect,
and the fiancee of Mr. F. W. Maddocks (well-
known in amateur - sporting circles, and now
entered for the bonds of matrimony) wore a nice
dress of grey and black. Most of the dresses were
fresh and bright, and the whole dance, was a great
success. Girls certainly ought to haunt athletic
hops, for the youth who plunges through the air
on a bike, or after a football, or in a paper-chase,
is renowned for rushing into the matrimonial state
almost as rapidly as he breaks track-records. The
number of athletic disciples who have wives to
hold their watches for them while Gtissie struggles
with a heat, seems incredible considering the
yonlli of the offenders.
The first concert given in Australia by Mr. and
Madame Marquardt, at Sydney Town Hall, on
Saturday (under thesegis of Churchill Otton), was
a great success, so far as the principals were con-
cerned, and, really, if the stars twinkle as |»er
advt. nobody need complain if the satellites aren’t
little Jnpiters. The chief attraction —Madame
Marquardt, in a white brocade gown with huge
white sleeves and diamond rings, which carried
half-way down the big hall, made a seraphic pic-
ture hugging the great golden harp, and plucking
harmonics from the strings thereof. An “ Elegie,”
by Parish Alvars, and a “Grand Mazurka do
Concert” were her two numbers, multiplied into
four by irresistible encores accompanied by a
miniature harp designed in flowers. Madame is
certainly a born aitiste; harp-music is no
cloak for artistic hypocrisy—you might as
well expect a cat to take a bath ns a
musical pretender to evolve an effective harp
solo. For there is any amount of soul in the
instrument David used to star Israel with—it is
more saturated with what the French call “lc
moi” of the performer than even the violin. I
think harp-playing is to violin-playing what
marriage is to courtship. The coy violin nestles
shyly under the chin and on the arm of the player
—but you throw both anus fervently round your
harp. And it makes such a pretty pose, too, that
Australian society ought certainly to take it up—
soul or no soul.
Mr. John Marquardt is a very good-humored
member of the tribe of Sarasate, and is evidently
constructed on much broader lines than Norman-
Neruda, who refused absolutely to contribute an
obligato to somebody’s song during the Halle con-
certs. Mr. Marquardt, on the other hand, plays
an obligato to the quavering cry of an amateur
soprano (who certainly ought to have been
nervous, singing a ten-and-sixpenny song in an
eigbteeupenny voice), much to the surprise of
people used to the disobliging ways of artists.
Besides being so amiable, Mr. Marquardt is tech-
nically master of the violin—he plays without
music always, and is bright and concise in style,
but lacks in magnetism and is not conspicuous for
sympathy. Miss Constance Evelyn, the budding
Sydney contralto, was also acceptable on the bill.
Miss Evelyn has a fruity voice, and when she
learns to respect vocal climax and to articulate
intelligibly—well, then she will be flying ’Ome-
wards with fell designs on “Markaysie.” The
next Marquardt concert was not announced,
but as R. S. Smythe is here with Kruse billed for
to-night (Saturday), dates will be difficult to fix
to avoid these meteors bumping in the straight.
One felt a pardonable sort of pride in the success
of the “ Gentleman Joe ” dresses, which were all,
I believe, made in Sydney, and it won’t be won-
derful if the local pin-and-needle brigade do plume
themselves a little on Mrs. Ralli-Carr's (Grace
Palotta) very dodgy dress of black and white
stripes, like a married magpie, with a bodice
draped in black chiffon, big sleeves and black jet
on it; toque bat, with black jet and white roses,
and a black and-white fan—just like a lovely lady
done in splash work. Maud Hobson wore pink
brocade with slashings of green velvet on the cor-
Hygiene teaches that nothing is so bene-
ficial to the human constitution ns thorough
cleanliness a theory verified by modern revela-
tions of the deadly microbes which infest the
flesh and blood—especially if we do not keep
ourselves in a clean condition, which ought to be
the first aim of every individual with any esteem
for himself. The use of Amykos has proved to be
very important to this end, by its great sanitary
power over the skin, month, teeth, &c. If you
value yourself, never be without this excellent pre-
paration.*
sage, sleeves like dropsical footballs, a toque hat
which beggars description and a green parasol
garlanded in pink roses. You wanted smoked
glasses to look at her. It can’t be much worry to
clothe “ Nellie” Massey—a draping of smoke-grey
with a white chiffon cross-over and a paint-uie-in-
oils-please-liat was her first array. Some of these
days, if she isn’t careful, this lady’s savagely
artistic garbing will land her on the public hoard-
ings as an advt. for Smears Pope.
The other girls were Mr, Jones’s daughters,
barring Decima Moore, who played a slavey, and
Elo Lloyd, who wore trousers again—playing a
“buttons” with a great deal of—er—breadth.
They were all charmingly dressed and contrasted
—Madge Rossell taking the odd trick in petunia,
with black lace petticoats smothered in jet, which
made a brave show when her heels went up, sug-
gesting the necessity for a kicking-strap. In the
second part, there was seaside dressing. Grace
Palotta was smart in a dark blue reefer jacket,
with cream silk facings over a cream skirt, and
topped by a very tasteful hat to match. Maud
Hobson (whose American accent takes a lot of
finding) sported ivory-white with a barred front,
and a cap like an uncooked damper on her golden
hair, which was beautifully matched by her yellow
petticoats. Decima Moore (whose voice still
resembles the voice of a modern conscience crying
in the social wilderness) wears a very disorderly
costume—a “South Sydney ” combination of grey
and scarlet, with a large red bat like a bush-fire or
a bold advt. for tomato sauce, while underneath are
scarlet petticoats. It is a boldly-vulgar concep-
tion, but Decima sutlers under (lie awful disad-
vantage, for a gee gee, of looking like a lady, even
though her costume might be the “salt sea foam,
tortoise-shell comb and looking-glass” of Fred
Kaye’s mermaid. “Gentleman Joe” was under
A.V. K. patronage on Monday—a large theatre-
party including two A.V.R. daughters and the
secretary. Talking of theatre-parties, the latest
craze in New York is for managers to give prizes
for the biggest ot these instruments of torture.
One prize-winner brought fifty-three. A Sydney
theatre-party of fifty-three would obviate the
necessity for any dialogue on the stage.
Women are as hard-as nails where their own sex
is concerned. Listen to a section of the dispute re
the appointment of a paid under-secretary (at
.£l2O a year) to Sydney Hospital Saturday board.
The post has been secured by a woman, and a
fellow woman, “a Doctor’s Wife,” writes to the
daily papers in a bold attempt to undersell her
sister. “ 1 am quite sure tiiere are plenty of
women who would gladly undertake the duties for
a quarter of the sum.” Imagine sending mis-
sionaries to preach brotherly love to the Chinese
with a ease like that in onr very midst !
I don’t think clever literary women should ever
marry, because, when their divorce-case gets into
the papers, ami their gushy love-letters are read in
open court, then their smart cynicisms strike you
in a hollow place ever afterwards, and you are not
convinced by little goes of airy satire which the
jvreaclier evidently never takes herself. Take, for
example, the love-letters ot “John Oliver Hobbes,”
the cynical authoress who got rid of Mr.
“Hobbes "the other day (Mr. “Hobbes” was a
bank-clerk named “Reginald!”) To imagine
such a brilliant woman bowing down to
an idol with tan feet and a “ situation in the
city ” is enough to make angels weep. Think
of the creosote and nitric acid in “Some Emotions
and a Moral,” and then read this love-letter
written by “J.0.H.” when the public weren’t
looking : “ My own precious Reggie, I must send
you a few lines to tell you to take care of your-
self, and be a good little boy, and keep out
of mischief ’’(which Reggie apparently found very
diffioult work). “ I am going to keep the spotted
jersey, it looks quite snappy. I am to sit and
play gooseberry to Miss and her young
man. Papa asked me if I thought they would be
embarrassed. Did you ever read such twaddle as
your poor Felice (her pet name) is writing? Poor
Felice! . . Sweetest darlingest and belovedest,
a thousand kisses and a thousand loves.” In
another letter she was very lonely and wanted her
“ pretty lamb.” In another (there were plenty of
them, alas!): “Dear, precious, old thing. She
grows more and more lonesome . . she feels as
if half only of her were Imre, and the sensation is
not comfy. I seem to reserve all my elegant com-
position for publication.” Yet Fate reserved
some of the other stuff for publication, too! And
the moral is—always polish your private corres-
pondence to the highest shine you can manage, for
you never know when a stolid man in a horsehair
coiffure will start reading it aloud to the re-
porters.
Some of the cross-questioning in the Hohhes
divorce-case was very up-to-date, and suggested
that the New Woman virus is spreading rapidly,
and is being taken into account in these rnle-nm
affairs. The petitioner was asked whether she
hadn’t suggested, before marriage, the advisa-
bility of dispensing with olive-branches? Also,
whether it really was her opinion that, as human
nature had not changed since the days of Abra-
ham, a man ouyht to run a harem ? “ Dili you tell
him you agreed with Tolstoi's views in the
* Kreutzer Sonata’ as to a wife hearing a sisterly
relation to her husband?” “Did you tell him
you loved him as a brother?” The whole thing
suggests the ground-plan of the “ Heavenly
Twins.” It strikes me that the modern lover
proposing an amalgamation with a New Girl has
a lot of delicate ground to cover if he wants to
know exactly where ’e are before the ceremony
starts.
My Melbourne correspondent writes :—“ At
the Austral Salon musical evenings it has
been found necessary to bang a large illuminated
placard of ‘Silence’ by the piano. And, to see
an unfortunate singer with that notice alongside,
facing a roomful of culchawed women, trying
hard to repress themselves and to look in-
terested —and to hear the unanimous gasp of
relief, followed by the resumption of the chatter
when the song is over—is an experience. But of
late the placard has not been so effectual —it is
getting worn and battered, and resembles a target
after a day’s shooting.
The fancy-dress ball at Govt. House was a
taking spectacle. Everybody not having been in-
vited, there was plenty of room for the |K>ssessors
of smart costumes to show them off. The Madden
family, in an emblematic group on the blue dais,
were well up to the mark in good looks. The
Acting-Governor’s shapely limbs get their best
show in tight-fitting black velvet; item, H.E. was
bedizened with point lace. The hostess hadn t
grasped the pose of the tragic Marie Antoinette,
but as a smiling make-believe in powdered
hair she did credit to her dresser. Miss
Ruby Madden, as Mi M'o Rosette, seemed
hampered all the night by the scrimpiness of her
skirts. As heauiy of the family, she was distanced
by lier sister, Sylvia, as Princess de Lainballe,
who tripped out with accurate flightiness. Lady
Clarke, with a silver-crescent moon poised on her
dark hair and a black dress spangled with little
silver stars, looked like a select abstraction in a
whirl of color. Miss Mary Clarke was very effec-
tive in the blue picket and red skirt of a vivandiere.
The cue native baronet, in helmet and sword
seemed to be playing the part of janitor,
as he only appeared in doorways. As a rosebush
in full bloom, Lady Holled Smith could not con-
ceal her majestic step, which always creates the
impression that she is inwardly singing “Ruleßrit-
tania. Miss Clare Berry, in quaint white satin
frock and spreading hat and plumes, sus-
tained her claim as an Australian beauty. Young
Mrs, Frank Stephen had arrayed her rosiness in a
garb representing pale sea-water bestrewn with
seaweed and shells, Frank Madden, of bucolic
aspect, bad got himself up as an old English
waggoner with much effect. A number of notably
pretty girls sauntered round as Puritan maids;
others, with good-looks as a foundation, came out
as doctors of law—the severity of either style
being a good set-off to rosiness and rounded
contours. The minuet and floral march were
pretty items of the evening’s entertainment. And
the refreshments were on a lavish scale.
“Piior to Kruse’s Melb. performance of the
Kreutzer Sonata, Prof. Marshall-Hall recom-
mended Conservatorium students, as a sort of
purification, to read Tolstoi’s book of the same
name. Later on, he called the lady pupils to-
gether and retracted his advice. He had forgotten
the details of the plot, he said, until, refreshing
his memory after his professional recommendation,
he had discovered that it was not altogether a
young lady’s tipple. The girls blushed at the
thought of their escape. Nevertheless, that very
day inaugurated a demand for the proscribed
work which Melb. librarians and booksellers still
confess themselves unable to cope with.
“Melb.’s musical dictator, like other geniuses,
suffers from absence of mind. In his early Melb.
days, before his grass-widowhood, he was once
escorted by his liege lady to a ‘society’ at home.
Drifting from her side soon after arrival, he was
button-holed by a brother musician, with whom
he. made merry for the rest of the evening. The
friends left together and boarded the same tram,
transferring themselves in due course to a sub-
uiban horse-car. Deep in discussion, they dis-
mounted at the terminus, and it was only on the
very threshold of Ins comrade’s villa that the
wandering sheep awoke to a sense of his own
responsibilities. 'Murmuring words to the effect
that* he’d forgotten his wife, lie turned like one
possessed and hurriedly retraced his steps into the
darkness.
“ When all expenses were paid, Johann Kruse,
’tis said, received a cheque for 80 guineas as the
price of Ins first Melb. concert. He promptly
handed the money to his father, a Hawthorn
(Melb,) chemist, who is dying by incites of mouth-
cancer. The old man says that nothing keeps him
alive now but bis son’s presence, and prophesies
that they will both leave Melb. at the same time,
though not together. When Johann, in Germany,
got news of his father’s illness he instantly packed
up and was on Ins way to his native Australia
within 48 hours.
“ The noble army of pay - dodgers lately
sustained a nasty rebuff at the hands of Prof.
Marshall Hall. Violinist Kruse had promised to
play to the conservatorium class during the prof.’s
lecture-hour, but sent an excuse. The lecturer,
entering to break the news to his students and go
on with thfe ordinary routine, found the hall
packed with strange women, attracted by the
‘ free concert.’ Remarking that he was not aware
that he had so many disciples, the monster went
on ruthlessly to point out that most of them were
oyer age, and. apart from that, had paid no fees.
Then he suggested that they had made a mistake.
Kruse’s ‘concerts’ took place elsewhere, at popu-
lar prices. Finally, he dismissed all intruders,
and, only when they were Well out of hearing, told
his own flock that Kruse wasn’t coming.”
“ An Australienne writing from London says i
This week I explored the New- Woman in her
native lair, and she frightens me. She is so ugly,
has such dreadful teetli (the French are quite
right—English women have horse teeth), and is so
aggressive. I went to a meeting of women-snf-
fragists, and was nearly talked to death by ram-
pageous females in dun-colored garments. Why,
if yon want a vote, must you be a frumpish guy ?
“Please don’t be‘New.’ It is so out of date
now. Acoordeon chiffon sleeves and huge toby
ruffles of lace or chiffon will keep you “old ” and
innocent, but they are vastly expensive, I must
own. I met some ’Mnrkan lady journalists, who
are harder to bear with than oven trie Englishers.
They talk of ‘Trilby’ as if it were inspired.
Why? What is there in ‘Trilby ’to make them
all rave? They go and see Du Maurier and call
his house a Shrine, and behave altogether
absurdly. The ideit of beauty now is to have a
well-shaped left foot—nothing else counts with
these fanatics.”

justices of the peace shall be elected by the adults
of the districts in which they are to exercise

An official return shows that in the Tweed

At Bungeydore, N.S.W., a “fly” man

so as not to lose it. Twice he has had to unhinge
the oak and carry it to the poll, being unable to

Vic. Protectionists have secured a duty on

It is now an absolutely-proved fact that
titles are bought and sold in England in the most
profligate manner. Sir Scaristrick Naylor-Ley-
land is one of the be-baubled creatures of Rose-
bery. He turned his back on the Tories, sub-
scribed to the Liberal funds, and the ex-Prender
stuck a word in front of bis name. And this is
how the man defends himself :
I learn that. I joined the Liberal Party in consideration
of a baronetcy, and I hat I purchased the said baronetcy
for a larve sum of money. It is obvious that these two
propositions contradict each other, inasmuch as if the
baronetcy bought me I could not have bought the
baronetcy.
There is no contradiction whatever. If you buy
bread with the money, the baker buys your money
witii bread. Anyone who scrubs his finger-nails
can get a title in England if he pays enough to
the funds of one of f'.<• two paities. Ask Brassey.

Premier Reid is well at N.S.W.
Treasury “ Practica’ly, I will abolish the Trea-
surer’s ‘advance-account,’” was his former budget
promise. Yet he has expended out of it £17,246
in two months only. He is abolishing it at the
rate of <£103,000 odd per an.
Q, Govt, resolutely declines to state what
it paid for Darling Downs land repurchased from
the squatters or the banks for settlement pur-
poses. The secret history of these purchases
might be worth reading. By many roads Kanaka-
land cash reaches the same maw.
The sudden extinction of the electric-
light in N.S. W. Assembly when Macdonald, M.P.,
referred to members’ morality, recalls the fate of
Nmian Melvillefe declaration in the same chamber:
“ I propose, Mr. Speaker, to throw a little light
on the subject.” Then the dynamo stopped.
It looks as if the Colo Valley grabsters
would have “ Buckley’s chance” of getting their
scheme through Parliament in face of the N.S.\y>
Labor-party—which, remarks Sydney D.T., “is
affected with a chronic form of the
enterprise mania.” Of course the D.T. means
“ afflicted.”
Q. Govt, is setting many baits in view of
the approaching elections. Civil servants receiv-
ing below <£lso p.a. are to have <£lo a year in-
crease; those between <£lso and <£3oo a <£2o in-
crease. An accident, of course. But will this fat
year blot out the memory of two lean years of 10.
per cent, deductions ?
Despite all Ministerial explanations to the
contrary, Alex. Kethel, one of the new N.S.W.
Leg. councillors, has taken serious umbrage at
Premier Reid’s flippantly-dictatorial remarks con-
cerning the new batch. Kethel is a Scotchman
with some “speerit,” and will never make an
easily-worked Government puppet.
Some mean N.S.W. election-candidates
profited to the full by the bribery clauses in the'
new Act. One new M.L.A., a trader, is alleged
to have repudiated (on “moral grounds”) even
his committee-secretaries’ out-of-pocket expenses,
and his score or more of canvassers and “ paid ”
organisers have never received a cent.
The National Ass party anxiously praya
for the speedy decease of the present S.A.
Assembly. The Tory idea is that Symon, Q. 0.,
is the only man who can fight Kingston, and
Downer and Solomon will both have to give way
to the brilliant lawyer if the latter can only be
induced to sacrifice the bone for the shadow.
Staughton, M.Ij.A., is one of the small
band of Freetraders in the Vic. Assembly. Never-
theless, he spoke strongly against a proposal to
reduce or abolish the duty on imported cattle.
Staughton is a squatter, and like every other
Freetrader wants Protection for his own industry.
Freetrade is always intended for the other fellow.
The N.S.W. Minister of Justice is not the
man to deal with the Mount Rennie trial and its
results. The influences which have so long em-
bastioned Judge Windeyer are smashing down,
but are still felt, directly or indirectly, in many
powerful quarters. In the long run, this hideous
scandal wi 1, metaphorically speaking, have to be
treated with a bowie-knife.
Sydney D.T. extracted nearly a column
of blood-curdling Irish “ atrocities ” from its last
English mail. Which recalls the time when it
was a standing order in the office of another great
Australian daily to ransack the mail for a couple/
of columns of the latest Irish brutalities. “ Keep
them as characteristic of the country as possible,”
was occasionally added.
The exact percentage of profit for the Q.
Northern line is about per cent, throughout the
whole extent— p.c. for the Townsville-Towm
section. Even the despised Central line pays its
-ft, and helps to swell the Southern revenue.
Northern wool and cattle, Northern gold, and
Northern railway receipts are the true secrets of
Queensland’s returning prosperity.
It is the custom in some N.S.W. public
schools on pay-Mondays for the teacher to an-
nounce the order —“ All those boys (or girls)
stand up who haven’t brought their school-fees.”
Thus the “paupers” are earmarked publicly.
ONE GOOD TURN, &c.
FLOSSIE (who has overheard conversation between her father's groom and
the family doctor): “ Ain’t you goin’ to buy our gee-gee?"
DOCTOR: “ No, my dear, I want a larger horse.”
FLOSSIE (reproachfully)-. “We always take any size baby you choose
to bring.”
and become the objects of the cheap but cutting
scorn of those boys (or girls) who have been able
to bring along their tuppences. Wanted—Free
Education.
Never was a man so heavily handicapped
j n politics as Frank Cotton, M.P. (N.S.W.),
whose unfortunate chronic sneer permeates his
debating attitude and speed). Catching the
Speaker’s eye, lie ad vances to the table, sticks out
one foot, throws back his chest, hangs one thumb
in the arm-hole ot his vest, and, in tones of wither-
ing sarcasm and concentrated scorn, hisses out—
“Mr. Speaker.” Which, with the Georgian
diction and precept, so impressed a new member
that he exclaimed : “ Henry George turned sour !”
Cotton’s sneer is the sort of thing you see on the
face of the wind-dried dingo corpse.
The Argus to the rescue again: “We
must make this country a cheap country, and thus
induce people to come and settle.” A cheap
country 1 Some Melbourne prices: Brawny
laborers, from 2s. fid. per day, upwards and down-
wards; female machinists, from 3s. a week;
mutton, l£d. ; beef, 2d, ; bread, Id. per lb.; pota-
toes, about 15s. a ton ; funerals, 30s. (including
whisky). A cheap country !
According to Coghlan, the Q. Govt, bor-
rowed (1881-1885) .£3,309,000, and, in the
same period, private borrowings amounted to
£13,291,000. Fiom ’B6 to ’9O Govt, borrowed
£8,793,000; private borrowers, £2,303,000, Thus,

in 10 years, a total of 30 millions odd of borrowed
money came into Queensland. No wonder things
boomed in those days, and no wonder Q. ever
since has been whipping the eat.
All the really first-class debaters, except
Crick and Ashton—and, in a sense also, Reid and
Millen—are gone from the N.8.W. Parliament.
Parkes, Wise, Barton, Dihhs (a sound debater on
finance) have vanished, and have left behind the
jagged roughness of an O’Sullivan, the snarling
-ueers of Cotton, the soft academic nothings
of Tom Ewing, the humorous bosh of Ferguson,
the snappy wit of Jack Haynes, and the expec-
torant ferocity of J. M.‘El hone.
The BuLLETrN would have preferred to
gee pome member of N.S. W. Assembly other than
Mr. R. Atkinson Price move the resolution affirm-
ing that Judge Windeyer should leave the Bench.
Long ago Mr. Price and Judge Windeyer differed
acrimoniously about Sydney School of Arts,
but this had apparently all been forgotten, so
that his Honor smiled on Mr. Price’s can-
didature for Gloucester, and paid him many small
attentions. Is Mr. Price in solemn earnest ?
N.S.W, Premier Reid: “My (Tory)
appointments to the Leg. Council were prompted
by a desire to bring about a peaceful settlement of
the differences existing between the two Houses.”
In the next breath : ,l The Council has been
altered, and, if necessary, it will be altered still
more.”
The act of brenthinsr is a form
That varies with the motive’s mould ;
Breathe on your palms to nv>ke ’em warm.
Breathe on your tea to make it cold.
S. A. National Ass employs a female can-
vasser to whip np the women voters for next
election, and the Tory women who turned up
their noses at the very idea of entering the polling
booth are being enrolled by the hundred. In
Adelaide and suburbs meetings of languid “pro-
pertied ” women are addressed by a young lecturer,
with waxed moustache and faultless clothes, on
the iniquities of Kingston. Afternoon-teas, in
which Mrs. Brown’s latest liaison comes up for
discussion, are now quite out of the running.
Almost every one of Reid’s appointees to
N.S. W. Legislative Council could be placed by past
outputof mouth and pen under obligation to explain
himself quite as pressing as that which keeps Dr.
Garran with his nose to the explanatory grind-
stone. Half of them opposed land-tax exemp-
tions; half of them condemned income-taxation;
while to Edward Pulsford is attributed one of the
manifestoes of the Landowners’ Defence League.
The attack on Dr. Garran is directed not so much
against the individual as against the Herald
oracle.
A paper, subsidised by the Reid party,
the other day accused The Bulletin of being the
tool of that fat monopoly Sydney Gas Co., and
promised that it would a tale unfold. As nobody
connected with The Bulletin has or has ever had
any more intimate connection with Sydney Gas
Co. than paying his gas-bill, there is no tale to un-
fold—save ttiis : That the Reid organ’s denuncia-
tion of the Gas Co., and its insinuation against
The Bulletin is only a squirt of mud intended
to divert public attention from the fact that one
of the chief authorities of the subsidised sheet in
question is an arch-boomster and underground-
engineer of the impending Colo Valley grab. The
Bulletin will watch with much curiosity the
Reid parly’sattilude towards this lovely reach-out.

When the measure was before Parliament, tire

Act should only apply to a municipality after a
poll at which more than half the ratepayers had
voted in its favor. When an attempt was made
to apply the system to Gawler (S.A.), Fat Man

Some prophets of evil profess to foresee a
regular old-man drought in N.S. Wales. If a
three-years’ drought of a really virulent type
should arrive, it will probably blast the Reid
Ministry next time it appeals to the country.
The bulk of the community goes on the primitive
logic that if the country is prosperous for the time
being the Ministry is good enough, but if it isn’t
then it is time to throw out the Government. A
Government which had a big loan to spend, and
during whose period of office there was a long
spell of damp weather in the West, and a big rise
in the price of wool, and a first-rate wheat harvest
in this country coincident with a famine
abroad, and a few big gold discoveries, would
possess the confidence of the electors as no other
L , on
Government has done for 30 years past. Reid
had better pray for rain.

Sir.—The most prominent and burning question just now is
the coming advent of a real live yachting Governor—one who
can lay claim to front rank as a practical seaman. All yachts-
men are agreed that the coming of Lord Brassey will do all that
is necessary to place yachting in this colony on a similar level
to that it occupies in other lands.—“ Yacht Owner.”

Stated that Messrs. Tom Roberts and
Arthur Streeton throw in their lot with the new

the other an amateur coterie.
An old Windsor (N.S. W.) native and Syd-
ney municipal identity celebrated his 85th birth-
day on August 20. Mr. Tuomas Broughton was
one of the first Sydney Municipal Council, and
was Mayor in 1817 -since which time he has
taken no part in public matters.
Howard C. Coghlan is sub-editor, not
editor, of the new Melb. Evening News. The

The members of a certain numerous and
highly-placed Melb. family never take luncheon.
It is a characteristic upon which they pride them-
selves that they are able to get along on two meals

Archbishop O’Reilly (S.A.) has discovered
that the R.C.’s of his diocese are liable for church
debts equal to 15s. per head, and he has begun an
agitation to secure the liquidation of the liability,
which exceeds .£30,000. He left his former
diocese (Port Augusta) practically free of debt
before bis translation to Adelaide.
Barrister Rurves and Attorney Frank
Stephen have just had a hght, or no fight,
according to various gossip, at Caulfield races.
The big papers bad one of their nonsensical
squelching agreements, but of course the small
fry made their market. Stephen is the Governor’s
brother-in-law, and supported O’Hara for the
'hospital election. Hence these tears.
Lord Carington, in respect of his recent
earldom, wrote thus to Lieut.-Gov. Way (S.A.) :
“ I keep my old name and call the buy Wendover
—a title offered by Mr. Pitt to my grandfather
about 1800. It is a small town in Bucks where
he had property. Hampden sat for it.”
Reader Wood, deceased, who had the
biggest foot in Maoriland, sat in the Assembly for
Parnell till put out by F. J. Moss, now British
Resident at Rarotonga. Wood, in his time, was
the only orator in the House ; of late years he was
the ornamental figurehead of the Northern Club,
Auckland. As a Treasurer his financial schemes
were barren.
A particularly pious shark found a com-
forting explanation of Purves’s cerulean reminis-
cences at the Melb. Law Institute. “It is right;
yes, it is quite right,” said the party in question,
“that the young men present should receive
instructibn in medical juris prudence.” Why, cer-
tainly. The time-honored Roger Bacon story is a
choice rasher of medical jurisprudence.
Guy Boothby, editor of Lend. Windsor
Magazine, some of whose recent fiction-work is
infinitely preferable to the bragging narratives of
“exploration,” which originally brought him into
notice, is to be married in October to Miss
Bristowe, daughter of a wealthy London Stock
Exchange man. The young man seems to be
striking oil. He is a nephew of Sheriff Boothby
(S.A.).
“The N.S.W. Chief Railway Commis-
sioner made an excellent impression at the recent
Railway Congress,” writes a London corres-
pondent to The Bulletin, “and his speeches
were listened to witli marked attention by those
who understood English. But he was handi-
capped by his unfamiliarity with French. Why
do not public men devote a little time to the study
of the one necessary language?”
Agent-General Duncan Gillies’ peculiar
style of oratory is only heard to advantage after
large greasy meals. At Gov. Bras. -ley’s London
send-off, Gillies (loq.) : “I am sure Lord Brassey
and the colonies will work together to promote
the benefit of mankind, and to favor human free-
dom.” Not even Duncan himself could say what
is meant by this copious blither; hut a man of
Gillies’ size must talk enormously or be for ever
lost.
Melbournian : “ There need be no secret
that it was Mickey Lynch, of long ago, who quar-
relled with the painter for depicting him in profile,
with one eye. He rivalled Mickey Dawson,
Fitzgibbon’s dad-in-law, in wealth, and his man-
sion was at Grace Park, Hawthorn, where he
gave a commanding site for the present Catholic
church. Lynch was aesthetic, and, Grace Park
being full of stumps, he covered them with
statues.”
A story without a moral. Three years
ago a public official got wrong in his cash, and had
to leave his billet in order to enter a gaol. On his
release he went to the West, not caring to face his
old associates. He is now said to be worth
.£lOO,OOO. But knock off a cipher and it is still
true that he is by exactly that sum better off than
he would have been had his cash not got mixed,
and had he continued quietly in his original civil-
service billet.
While walking home, absorbed in some
lively andante, Prof. Marshall Hall fell in a gutter

Solomon, M.P. (S.A.), made
£3OOO in hard cash out of his first
attempt at Westralian flotation a
few weeks ago. Now he is giving
the Assembly a rest and devoting
his financial ability to the Ex-

Augustus Sleight, “under-
taker to His Excellency,” was
having a drink in a Melbourne
pub. the other day, when a man
at the other end of the counter
sang out “ Gus !’’—meaning the
waiter. Whereupon Sleight turned
round witli “Hullo!’’ “Oh,”
said the other man, “ I—l don’t
wahn’t you , I wahn’t th’ Gus that
waits on the livin’, not the wahn
that waits on the dead !”
“ ‘Colonel’ Fcez,’’ writes a
Bulletin correspondent, “is in
great form in London, and is a
conspicuous figure at all Queens-
land functions. He is always
ready to oblige with a song, and,
considering his age and the amount
of lemonade he must have got
through during his long residence
in the city of sin, sweat, and sor-
row, his voice is marvellously good
and fresh.”
“Sir Arthur Hayter,” writes
The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent, “sacrificed the N.S. W.
Governorship to his pai ty. It was
supposed that he would he able to
hold his seat as Liberal member
for Walsall against any opposi-
tion, but the Uuionistic wave en-
gulfed him, with many others,
and he is now seatless, having
lost his chance of one of the diplo-
matic prizes. He is a very nice
fellow, and would have made a
most popular representative of
Downing-street.”
Phil. May is reported, in a widely-circu-
lated English press interview, as having said that
he formed his unique condensed style as a result
of the bad printing in the (Sydney) BULLETIN.
Which is a bit at variance with this authentic
story. A Bulletin man once said to Phil. :
“ Why don’t you finish-up your work a little more
—put in back-grounds and so on like other
artists?” “Look here,” said May, “ I try, like
yon, how much I can leave out, not how much I
can put in. And I haven’t yet done with con-
densation. When I can draw with half my pre-
sent lines, I shall be able to earn six times the
money.”
Mrs. Lowe, Melbourne's arch-Woman-
Suffragist, relates that a local M.L.C. lately gave
as the reason of his opposition to the extension of
the franchise that he “didn’t believe in any-
thing French.” Mrs. Lowe is the lady who,
having said in a lecture that “woman was made
by God to match man,” was reported by the Age
assaying “woman was made by God to mash
man.” An apology was immediately clamored for
BACK STREET AMENITIES.
HE : “ Father’ s going to drink Sally’s ' ealth; she’s gone and got
engaged.”
SHE : “ Your father's good at that, Is t he young man nice ?”
HE: “ He’s got nice whiskers.”
SHE (jealously) : “So has our cat.”
and received —the usual stereotyped regret that*
our reporter had written “mash ” for “match ”
“ a difference,” concluded the par., “ considerable
to the eye, though little to the ear and less to the
heart.” The Mdb. Suffragists have not since
asked for any apologies.
W. H. Groom, the underground engineer
of Kanakalaud Assembly, the other day com-
pleted his 33rd year as member for Toowoomba.
He was first elected in ’62, and has sat continu-
ously ever since without being able (thanks to
general distrust) to engineer himself into his
darling ambition, a Ministerial seat. Toowoomba
was for long years his pocket borough ; but his
power seems now on the wane. He was made
junior instead of senior member at last election,
and thrown out of an aldermanship by a big

farmer and murderess—from a M.L. print.

that his supporters can’t persuade themselves he’ll

The AusTKAuia.N otak, the only self-styled
Protectionist Sydney daily, won’t wash its hands
of N.S. VV. Legislative Council. Like historical
England, it carries on its wars with the aid of
foreign mercenaries. It now ad vises the Council
“to bring off a veritable coup” by resisting the
public’s demand for a land-tax, by exempting
from such tax all present municipal lands. Let
that principle be regarded as just, or unjust, the
people will not permit the irresponsible, nominee
and unrepresentative Chamber to shape its taxa-
tion. That is the pressing point. Ey always
shouting for help from i he Leg. Council, the Star
compels those non-thinkers who believe that it
speaks for the whole Protectionist party to assume
that that party concedes to the Upper House
the right to control public finance. The Protec-
tionist party does no such thing. If the Council
were conceded the right to shape land-taxation, it
would also, and logically, claim the right to shape
the Customs tariff.
Richard-HiII,M.L.C.
(N.S.W.), is dead. lie
was born in Elizabeth-
street, Sydney, in 1810,
his father being “ master
of the lumber-yard ”
i.e., overseer of the con-
victs employed in the
timber industry. The
buildings of the lumber-
yard are now used as the
Imperial Naval Store-
house, and the old build-
ingin George-street north
still bears the inscription,
“ Erected in the year
1812, L. Macquarie, Esq.,
Governor.” Until quite
recently two other his-
toric buildings were in
this neighborhood, one
having on the keystone
the initials I.N. and the
year 1808 —it being the
residence and office of
Sydney’sfirst postmaster,
Isaac Nichols. The build-
ing adjoining had also a
monogram and date on
the keystone, “ M.R.,
1810,” it being the resi-
dence of the historic
Margaret Reibey—whom
many persons seek to
identify with Margaret
Catchpole. These build-
ings were purchased by
Govt, for the purpose of
forming the new roadway
between George - street
and Circular Quay. Mr.
Hill and W. C. Went-
worth married sisters.
Mr. Hill was a non
-smoker and almost a
teetotaller. His death
was caused by a chill
following on the too
rapid drinking of a glass
of water.
Old George Bates, the oldest colonist of
South Australia—an excellent portrait of whom,
by Duryea, Adelaide, is printed in this issue—
is dying in the Destitute Asylum at time of
writing. He is the same age as the century. He
ran away from a whaler in 1826, and made his
home with some white companions on Kangaroo
Island, where they led a wild life fighting with
the blacks on the mainland and carrying off young
girls to stock their ebony harems. When the
first regular settlers landed at Nepean in 1836,
they found Bates and his comrades there, clothed
chiefly in kangaroo skins.
Observers note an ever-increasing tendency
in acclimatised deciduous trees to become ever-
green in Australia. Here the willow scarcely
sheds its leaves ere bursting into bud again ; whilst
in Maotiland it is quite bare for about four
months.
Nathan Herman’s New Premises.
Nathan Herman, the progressive merchant of 9
Wynyard-street, city, promises to transform that
unobtrusive and quiet throughfare into one of the
busiest spots in the heart of the city. The ware-
house has been renovated and enlarged, and on
Saturday Messrs. Rowe and Spain, architects,
formally handed the new premises over to Mr.
Herman. A Star repoiter called upon the enter-
prising proprietortheotherday, just in time to view
a choice shipment of elegant and up-to-date goods,
of which the latest fashions in dress materials,
beautiful in texture and design, were perhaps the
most striking. The labor of transferring the
stock to the new departments has been successfully
accomplished by the large staff which was engaged
when the business attained its present proportions.
The basement has been set apart principally for
bedsteads, and the magnificent lighting arrange-
ments, combined with fine display, render a visit
a pleasure as well as a speculative venture. On
the first floor are all classes of carpets, linoleums
and oilcloths, including genuine Brussels carpets
of undoubted value, which are cut and laid for
buyers at the astonishing price of 2s. a yard. The
famous teas (30s. per chest of about 401 b.), which
are packed on the same floor, are meeting with a
remarkable sale. It would be tedious to dilate at
length upon the surprises of v. Inch a visit is pro-
ductive; suffice it to say that the new premises
are worthy of the stock, and that the stock is
worthy of a continuance of public patronage. All
household furniture, and other requirements, from
the simplest lines to handsone pianos, are offered
at prices which must lie experienced to be compre-
hended. The boot department has already created a
stir among the firm’s customers, and this section of
the misfit parlor is one of its bulwarks. The pro-
prietor prides himself upon the excellent watches
which are sold, with a chain attached, at 5s lid
and 7s 6d. Country residents are receiving these
delightful little timekeepers by post. Mr. Her-
man’s £2 parcel, is the choicest fruit of his misfit
parlor. It contains :—Two outer shirts, two
undershirts, six pairs socks, two neckties, two col-
lars, six handkerchiefs, one set of studs, a hat, one
pair braces and a pair of boots, and, crowning all,
a complete suit in excellent material. Mention of
Mr, Herman is never complete without a reference
to his superb iron safes, which have made a name
for themselves throughout Australia. Tobacco
and cigars are also two of the choicest bargains
which the firm supplies.*

"For the pasts or 4 years, I have been a
freat sufferer from rheumatism and piles,
tried all sorts of medicines, but derived
no good from them. I chanced to read one
of your books and thought I would give
your Sarsaparilla a trial. I did so, and after
f e
taking one bottle I felt better, and after
taking 4 bottles I was a new man. I was
sorry I never took it before, for it would
have saved me very much pain. ”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Out on the banks of the Warrimoo,
Hunting the blue-skinn’d kangaroo.
Chasing the ’possum along the creek,
Scalping the dingo, fat and sleek ;
Ringing the hills with a wild “ Halloo !”
Mocking the voice of the shrill curlew ;
Herding the cattle with fearless dash,
Rounding them up with a whirl of the lash ;
Up with tlie stockmen at break of day,
Galloping, galloping, miles away ;
Slashing the horses—the devil may care ;
Spurring them on—the devil knows where ;
Rattling, battling, over the stones.
Screwing their muscles and racking their bones.
Lounging at night in the stockmen’s but,
Bag-covered windows and doors tight shut,
Slicing the damper, spongey and hot,
Pouring the tea from a broken-lipped pot,
Squatting around the great flaring log,
Swilling more tea —in the absence of grog—
Puffing out clouds of blue-colored smoke,
List’ning to yarns from “the city bloke,”
Roaring a sna c from a ten-year-old song,
Swearing and ■ q alibiing half the night long;
Nothing to care lor —nothing to fear.
Never a trouble throughout the year.

i English manufacturers are objecting t<

They don’t kick on behalf of the sheep, but just
because tar does not improve wool. The difficulty
cm be got over with boracic acid, which may be
dusted on dry, or sponged or brushed in as a solu-
tion (11b. acid to 3 pints water), or rubbed in with
the finger as an ointment made by melting together
three pounds tallow and salad oil, adding the
boracic acid while stirring. The last is best, tallow
being easily removed from wool.

It was inevitable that song-writers and
ballad-mongers should seize on the sensational
incidents of the trial of George Dean as a subject
for their muse. There has been published in Syd-
ney a “descriptive song on George Dean ” which
easily beats the record. It is called “Return of
Life ; ” and the last verse and chorus are here
quoted
At the Royal Commissioners’ office his friends had
gathered round,
His mother standing by the door listening for every
sound ;
A look of death was in her eyes, the jury had just
returned.
The verdict was “ not guilty,” in the second trial he
learned,
A pleasing look flashed o’er her face, the decision had just
been passed,
My son’s innocence has been proved, and he is free at last.
The trial has had your sympathy, it has been an awful
strife,
May the joys he shared by Dean and his friends, as heaven
returns his life.
Chorus.
Though he never knew he had a friend in those who were
outside,
Throwing in what they could spare to have him fairly
tried ;
Our troubles ought to teach us never to judge too rash,
There’s credit due to Crick and Meagher for gathering in
the cash.
Poor Dean !

A few weeks ago, at Oakey station (Cook-
town district), a gentleman was attacked by a
long yellow-coated animal, with a slight mane and
long wavy tail. This was not the first appearance
of the creature. It is surmised that the animal is
a cheetah, one having escaped from one of
H.B.M.’s ships while lying in port, years ago.
Many think, writes The Bulletin’s London
correspondent, that Salisbury made a mistake in

serve under Joe Chamberlain.

One Maori tribe, of Rotorua district, is

An improper “soiety” novel almost in-
variably opens with, or soon leads to, an artist s
studio. An easel in the first or second chapter is
the erotic writer’s trade-mark.
Chief Justice Berkeley, of Fiji, in sen-
tencing a coolie laborer to death, lately, said that
he had strong doubts as to the efficacy of the
punishment meted out to murderers, especially
coolies. During his career he had sentenced more
men to be hanged than any Judge in Australia or
Fiji, and now had to sentence two more, making
a number of 50 that he had sent to the gallows.
He had at last concluded that the penalty was not
feared as it should be, and he had at the present
time under the consideration of the Executive a
system which he thought would be more effective,
and which he hoped to see passed into Law. A
fiendish coolie wife-murderer, sentenced to death
at the recent sessions, when asked if he had any-
thing to say, replied “ Atcha ” (“All right,”)—
adding that he slew the woman because he wished
to return to Calcutta, and he could get back
quicker by being hanged than if he went by boat.
An alleged Tasmanian centenarian, one
Thomas Clesby, said to be 111 years of age, pegged
out the other day at Launceston. Quiet, peaceful,
sleepy Tasmania grows more centenarians to the
square mile than any other province, and S.A.
comes a good second. The race will probably
become extinct, however, in another 50 years or
so. Very few centenarians can stand close inspec-
tion, and when the birth-registration system is
old enough to explode them the race of very
old men will fade away, like Jeremiah, the
Waterloo veteran. The centenarian nowadays
rests on his own statements and his alleged recol-
lection of events which no one else is old enough
to remember, so that he can’t be bowled out.
When another toothless patriarch meets him they
always corroborate each other, because each one is
afraid lest the other relic may be genuine, in
which case he would only show his ignorance by
contradicting him. It is a beautifully pathetic
spectacle when a veteran of 110 and another
veteran of 109 foregather, and proceed to remem-
ber things that never happened, while a group of
enthusiastic admirers supply them with tobacco
and free drinks.
Dear Bulletin, —Jerome Darnel’s story,
“A Down Pin,” in a recent Bulletin recalls a
scene I once witnessed. The game was billiards,
and it stood at 49-47, when the lesser scorer
chalked his cue. It was a hard shot, and he laid
his cue on the cushion and glanced hurriedly from
one ball to the other to choose his shot. He
decided to try for the five, and, scrambling on the
table, poised his cue carefully on his knuckles, and
was swinging it steadily when the news came.
“Marshall, old man,” whispered a voice from the
cushion, “your wife died at half-past eight.’
Never a feature stirred on Marshall’s face ; his cue
oscillated once more, then shot swiftly forward ;
the ball cannoned rapidly and banged into the right
pocket off the red —a fine shot. Marshall watched
the ball’s progress until it dropped, then turned
quickly. “My God!” he cried, “poor little
Nellie 1 ” and his eyes filled with tears as he
crushed on his hat and hurried from the room.
Stoicism or callous cynicism ? I make no effort to
solve the question.-

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Two or three more illicit stills have been found
in Sydney. All Sydney is now divided into two pans—
one consisting of private stills and the other ,of public
tote-shops, and yet the police go through the solemn
farce of having a little suburban tote-man, who has fre-
quently offended (i e., he has frequently been prosecuted)
sent up for six months without the option of a fine;
whereas in King and Pitt streets, the very heart of the
city, anyone who chooses can, at any time of the day and
until almost midnight, enter lote-shops conducted in
first-class expensive premises without the slightest pre :
tence at privacy -with lists boldly hung on the walls,
men behind the counters taking money, ahd boys going
round with big pencils scratching off the “laid” doubles.
There they are, in full blast, 30 of these places, some of
them conducted in premises leased out by. rich and in-
fluential firms, and there can he no possible conclusion
hut that somebody is bribed to allow them immunity.
This sort of thing makes the legal administi'a.tirpi and the,
police system “ stink in the nostrils of the oommilnity."
• » • *
Since the foregoing was written the Sydney
police visited (on Tuesday morning) all the principal
layers of doubles in the city, and ordered them to
instantly close their premises, under pain of arrestc-They,
closed unanimously, and until the force goes tousleep
again business will presumably be conducted by the back
door. Tills action shows that the police were well aware
previously of the existence of the gambling-hous.es in
question, else they couldn’t have found the whole lot of
them with such unerring accuracy in one forenoon ; and,
under these circumstances, some person in authority
should be called on to explain why aciion was not taken in
each case as soon as it came to the official knowledge.
Aiso, he or somebody else should be invited to explain
why the law-breakers weren’t arrested, instead of simply
being warned not to do it again. When the force finds a
burglar, or a murderer, or a forger, or a Chinaman play-
ing fan-tan, it runs him in for the offence he has already
committed ; the idea of telling him he will be arrested if
be does it again never occurs even to the wildest and
reddest-beaded policeman that ever wore the regulation
boots. Why isn’t the belting-shopkeeper treated like any
other criminal? Is there any reason which can bear
honest inspection for the extraordinary latitude allowed
him?

Editor Bulletin,— Since the publication of the
weights for Melb. Gup I notice, with a certain amount of
secret satisfaction, that all the sporting writers of Aus-
tralia have either, ignored The Jeweller, or said “no
chance.” Now, seeing he won the Loch Plate, w.f.a., two
miles, and won the Summer Cup ns a four-year-old with
9.5, in 2.375, and as he is now in good trim, six years old,
and still 9.5, I will consider it (barring the usual chapter
of accidents) “ a hook(e) for The Jeweller." 1 put my bit
on Patron last year on the same line of reasoning.—A

The departure of Tim Swiveller for India is a
blessing for punters, especially the Melb. division. Tim—
he started at a very short price for the last two Melb.
Cups, and was in a fair way to repeat the offence—had
the credit of being at least 211 b. better than his merits.
He beat Sainfoin by a head for the Caulfield Cup of '93,
after a jostling race, and was disqualified on the
strength of a_ swerve, which, although it may not have
interfered with Sainfoin’s chance, undoubtedly showed
Tim to be “all out” at the finish. Yet the public would
have it that the ex-hurdle-racer was a good one, and a
stayer, notwithstanding the moderate form of Sainfoin
before and after the much-disputed event. ’ Tim Swiveller,
W!>s another Chicago (also backed (or two Melb. Cups
with painful results), and a striking example of the truth
that anything way “just get home” in the Caulfield
Cup under favorable circumstances.

“ In the interests of political freedom we should
keep gambling under the han of the law, and not give it
a legal blessing,” screams Rev. Joseph Nicholson, of
Adelaide, the apostle who fights so bard against the tote.
Doesn’t Ikey Mo, the bookmaker, enjoy a legal blessing?
If not, how comes it that he can Openly follow on a race-

Sam Cook’s withdrawal of The Admiral from
the Metrop. handicap,' whilst leaving him in the A.J.C,
weight-for-age races, which incur no penalty for the
winner, seems to point to a serious design upon one of the
Cups—probably the Melb.. Cup. Things are not often
what they seem in turf tactics, it is true ; but Cpok is
genuinely fond of The Admiral, and would give something
for the mere “honor and glory” of capturing the big
race with his.old idol, after all.

A Melb. photoer had the good luck to kodak
jockey Lewis in the act of getting killed at Caulfield
Steeplechase.
The very latest Southern starting-price swindle.
A country backer having gained introductions to several
S.P. merchants by wiring his money and instructions
before the race each day, took advantage of Saturday’s
racing at Caulfield to wire to each of the S.P. bookies
at ll.hb Saturday morning: “Have wired £lO So-and-
So. Half win, half place. If not laying place all to
win.” In every case it was too late to collect the wired
money (the Money-Order offices close at 12 on Saturdays).
Only one of the bookies wired to laid S.P. for a place, and
he, of course, had to draw 7 , but when the losing bookie
met a winning bookie over the same customer at the
Money-Order office on Monday morning, it was found that
the losing bookie’s money had been wired to Melbourne
after the race was over, whereas none of the winning
bookie’s money had come to hand.

There has been a bit of a “Royal scandal”
lately, writes Tub Bulletin’s London correspondent.
One of the young Tecks—Francis of that ilk— n captain in
the Ist Dragoons, stationed at the Curragh, recently
went a “ mucker ” and for a time could not pay up. He
laid the ridiculous wager of £lO,OOO to £lOOO on an Irish
two-year-old called Bellevin, which had won two good
races at Manchester. But the weight of 10,000 sovs. was
too much at the Curragh, and the animal was beaten.
Francis’s default became public property, lint at last
somebody—perhaps a rich Australian—found the money
and'bookie was paid. The young Tecks were left com-
fortably off by the late Duchess of Cambridge, out of her
savings from the handsome allowance paid her by the
poof British public, but no fortune could stand such
plunges. ,
No horse goes better at Randwick than

Euroka’a half-length defeat when trying to give
Finis two stone at Rosehill, last Saturday, does not dis-
count hva Epsom chance, and if the wayward one be in
right mood he should go close to winning the first big
handicap of the season. Mr. Oxenham's Solarium, though
a popular favorite and well-treated by the handicapper,
is hardly fit enough yet to win a fast-run mile race. By
Caulfield Cup time things may be different.
The heavily-weighted erst M.L. crack St.
Hippo is now going great guns at Randwick, and, though
the cognoscenti look askance at his enlarged hock, it
doesn’t seem to trouble him much,
Though Delaware is first favorite for both
Epsom and Metrop., it is probable that Albicore and
Oxide will represent the stable. The latter will be very
dangerous for the Metrop. Delaware will perform for
some of the w.f.a. events, but he will be seen at his best
in the Melbourne Cup.

they know it. Should his mission be the Epsom or
Metrop., he will be dangerbus; if nob, he is well treated
in the two big Cups.

Nobleman, evidently in qOmmission for the
Epsom ran a good third with Bst. 81b. on his 3-year-old
back in the All-aged Stakes at last Randwick Autumn
meeting, when the mile was run in Imin. Msecs. As he
. has now five months’ improvement in his favor, and a
pound less to carry, he should cut out a very fast mile.

Mannlioher now disputes first favor for the
A J O Derby with Bob Ray, and is, moreover, well backed
for the Metrop. Many think that both he and Bob will
find a mile and a-half too far for them when they meet
Coolalta, Blue Cap, and Valiant, and that these three will
fight out the Derby finish.
Ripple, about the most consistently unlucky
mare racing, broke the spell by winning the Hurdle
at Fleraington last Saturday, carrying lOst. 111 b.
This was her first win, and she had gob right up in the
handicaps by running six seconds in as many races.
Raak scored her fourth consecutive win at the
same meeting, but instead of winning by five or six
lengths as previously, she only won under punishment by
half a length. This is accounted for by her last win being
over a 4i furlong course instead of over 3-furlongs as
previously. Like Miller’s other flying 2-year-old, Meg,
distance will evidently find Raak out.

Two Cup candidates, Lord Richmond and St.
David oame prominentlv into notice at Flemington in
the August Handicap. The former, a four-year-old, and
up to last Saturday a maiden, won under the feather-
weight of 6st. 101 b., but it was a good perforrnanoe, as he
was not half well. St. David, who was backed down to
2 to 1, never had a chance, as he was turned round when
the barrier went up, and his owner (W. T. Jones) and
followers had to wear sackcloth. He is, however, a
beautiful colt(Carlyon— Queen of Nations) and must have
shown the stable something extra. He has been backed
both for Derby and Cup.

“Young Claude Rome (son of the popular
Tom Rome, of Queensland), of whose prowess as an
athlete I have often spoken, has,” writes The Bulletin s
London correspondent, “just passed out of Sandhurst
military college with the sword of honor. He was the
smartest fellow there —the best cricketer, footballer,
hurdle-jumper, boxer, horseman, and billiard-player, a
record almost equalling that of the ever-famoua Ted
Evans, of N.S.W., who could do anything a bit better
than anybody else. Young Rome is much sought after
in the cavalry branch of the service, and has been offered
a commission in the 10th Hussars, 9th and 12th Lancers,
and other smart regiments. The stalwart young Banana-
man will probably select the 9lh Lancers, who shortly
leave for India.

The semi-finals in the football competition for
Sydney Agricultural Ground trophies were played last
Saturday. Wallaroo v. University on the Cricket Ground
was a remarkable match. The early part of the first half
saw Abbott score a splendid goal from a free-kick, and
later on the fat man of the Uni.’s rushed over the line
and secured a try. Then Wallaroo, by determined com-
bination, bore the Uni.’s gradually back, until getting
within a few yards of the line, Manchee, the Wallaroo
half, caught the hall from behind the scrum and instantly
slipped over ; Wickham, with an exhibition kick, scored
a goal. Soon after the luck of a lifetime gave a Uni. a
pass intended for a Wallaroo, and thus by half-time,
University having scored the goal, led by 11 to 5.
After the interval the Wallaroos played up, forc-
ing the Uni.’s down again and again. Walker, the wonder-
ful Uni. sprinter, never showed at all, and Abbott, their
famous three-quarter, was “flopped” nearly every time
by Lane, the Wallaroo wing-forward. Wallaroo played a
fine uphill game, and, when Lane scored a try for them,
and Wickham kicked a fine goal, raising the Wallaroo
score to 10 as against Uni.’s 11, the crowd became enthu-
siastic. Time being close up, the side which should score
a try would undoubtedly win ; so things grew exciting.
Wickham got the ball and did score a try. He was
temporarily laid out, but all was over when Alcock,
his fellow Wallaroo, sent the ball high and straight
between the goal-posts, Wallaroos winning by 15 to 11.

In the Randwick v. Pirate match, on Agricul-
tural Ground, the Randwick fat man had his day out.
The first-half was contested bitterly enough, but the over-
excitable Pirates destroyed their own combination, and
Randwick led by sto 0. In the second-half the Randwick
“Jumbos” and their brother forwards rushed down the
Pirate defence, the game ending 20 to 01

The Victorian Rugby team, in playing the
N.S.W. Western Districts’ team, were handicapped by the
absence of several of their best men, and still further by
the presence of the opposing captain Read, the great fat
man of N.S.W. Rugby football. In the first half neither
side scored, but kept plunging and scrambling on the wet
ground ; in the second the fat man asserted himself with
dire results, and rushing down the foe’s ranks with
18st. momentum generously passed at the last moment
to another player, who dashed over. Western Districts
won by 11 to 4.

the Pirate team, Wood (Sydney University back) and

Geelong (without Peter Burns, Young, or Singleton),
beaten by Collingwood, played one of their best games.
The wonderful improvement in Collingwood play sur-
prised their opponents, who probably will be again on top
when the season terminates. Essendon, though not
taking it to heart, are the most unlucky team playing.
Though they have lost almost twenty games by accident
and otherwise, their match with S. Melb. on Saturday
was as good a game as any played in Melb. They will
finish sixth on the premiership list this year.

The coming of Zimmerman will mark an epoch
in Australasian cycling. He is a w'ondrous flyer and a
still more wondrous advertiser. Zim. comes from
America, where the athlete is more often made than
born ; where trainers bribe reporters into writing cock-
and-bull stories about their men’s heroisms. Sullivan,
in the height of his popularity, was shot at, garroted,
chased by mad bulls, poisoned, and threatened, and
everywhere he went he was followed by love-sick youth
and beauty. How many young and lovely girls the
great man protected from outrage 1 How many lives he
saved ! How often did he stop the runaway horses, and
go modestly away without telling the enraptured girls in
the carriage who he was? And wasn’t it Sullivan’s glare
in the ring that alone froze the blood of Slade, the Maori ?

then sail for Sydney on Sept. 1. Accordingly, he would
reaoh Sydney in time to grasp some of the £6OO which the

The N.S.W. Cricket Association is an honorary

The latest American leg-sensation is the “ umbrella-
dance ”in “Trilby” at N.Y. Casino. Two sisters do a
wild step behind a large white umbrella, which shuts out
all view of their heads and bodies and allows only their
legs, bare to the knee, to be seen. It is one of the rnost
suggestive dances ever seen. At its conclusion the sisters
furl the gingham and show themselves fully dressed with
the exception of the space below the garter —a disgusting
disillusionment. In the opinion of the stalls they ought
to go off sideways with the umbrella viciously open all
the way.

Ada Crossley, not unmindful of the handsome send-off

than of Miss Crossley ; but then Mrs. V.G. is so beautiful
a woman that she would make her way anywhere even if
she hadn’t half a voice.
A really extraordinary number of good voices are offer-

Snell; It was bad business on Boucicault’s part to
bring in “The Importance of Being Earnest” on the
heels of “The Amazons.” Both comedies are of the one
school, but whilst Pinero’s play is a marvel of conscien-
tious labor, plus brains, Wilde’s has the brains minus the
conscientious labor. All that is important in Oscar’s
yabber-yabber has been knocking about in the papers
during the last three or four months. His epigrams
being familiar, the play is gutted, and we get merely
half-a-dozen people all infected with O.W.’s opinion that
talk is the only rational exercise for a man or woman.
For all the business it contains “The Importance of
Being Earnest ” might he adequately performed in a bal-
loon. In fact, as an acting production it doesn’t amount to
a row o’ pins—that is, a Pinero.
Little Marie Lohr, aged about four years, daughter of
manager Lohr, is, according to her father, “an experi-
enced actress.” The other afternoon, says Sydney
Sunday Times, she played at Monkhouse’s benefit at the
Lyceum, and got a bouquet thrown to her. Sh'e brought
it home, and at night carried it down to Her Majesty’s,
where she was playing in “The World Against Her.”
Hazlitt noticed her coming in with the bouquet, and
asked her w'hat she was going to do with it. Drawing
the manager down to her two-foot-six height, she
whispered in his ear : “ I want you to give it to the man
in the orchestra, and let him hand it up to me to-night,
same as he does to the other ladies.”
Good gush. The Arous’s “ Victorian Girl,” at Covent

Florence Lloyd should strictly avoid appearing on the

Fitzgerald Bros. New London Company
Thb enterprising Australian circus proprietors—
who have ministered so long to the innate craving
of the Australian youth for sawdust, spangles,
and horses of varied educational attainments—are
now returning from our “Antipathies (as Mrs.
Potts Point Hiys) with the result of their investi-
gations into the wonders of the amusement world.
This result shapes itself into the new sensational
company due in Adelaide by the German Lloyd s
s, s. Gera about the 17th of September.
After travelling for 15 years on business, the
travels extending over the whole of the Anstralias,
Maoriland and the surrounding islands, the firm
began to think that the mere travelling for busi-
ness was a dull, humdrum sort of an atfair a
mere routine repetition, after all—and a notion set
in that a little spell of travelling for pleasure would
add variety to a monotonous round of continuous
change. So, on the conclusion of the recent suc-
cessful Maoriland season, they took the Mariposa
for the Great United States, the land of George
Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Barnum, and
other great men, hoping to discover secrets in the
circus line which might bring an enhanced joy to
the lives of the Australian small boy and girl—to
say nothing of those who make the juvenile popula-
tion a pretence for their own visits to the circus,
A rapid tour through the principal cities of the
United States and Canada was accomplished,
after which the firm crossed the Atlantic and
arrived in London. Here they spoilt several
weeks closely scrutinising the music halls, the
circuses and whatever else they could see, with a
view of bringing back to Australia, a company of
such an entirely novel and original character that
a great success must immediately follow.
After London, Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, and
Copenhagen were visited, and the choicest novel-
ties secured in each continental city to add to
those sensations engaged in London, the new
company set sail from Southampton on August 4,
and will arrive in Adelaide about September 17.
The season begins about the 18th September in
the Adelaide Exhibition, large buildings being
necessary for the production of the sensational
surprises on which the new organisation is based.
From Adelaide the company will go to the
Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane Exhibitions,
playing to popular prices ; after which the whole
combination will commence the Maoriland tour
some time in October in Auckland, under canvas.
The new Company includes —and is based upon
—three European sensational acts. The first is
the sensational trapeze act of Madame Adeline
Antonio. This charming young lady, after a
series of novel trapeze feats, is hauled up to the
roof of the building on to a pedestal, from which
site falls backwards into a net 100 ft. below, turn-
ing twice in the air before alighting in the net.
This is said to bo one of the most thrilling acts
ever seen in this line of business, and the
Fitzgeralds have long recognised that what
an approving world desires most jn its col-
lective public or private life is Thrill—
whether in politics, journalism, religion, art,
music, drama, and even law (especially divorce).
Thrill is the one desirable thing which ap-
proaches nearer to the honey-pots of Heaven
than anything else terrestrial. And any man who
can sit unmoved and unthvilled while a lovely
fellow-creature falls through space—apparently
from nowhere to nowhere —must be a hopeless
melancholic or a hardened and inflexible jour-
nalist, jaded to indifference by a long course of
melodrama or burlesque. Madame Antonio, after
continental triumphs in Paris, has been a fixture
at the London Aquarium for over a year, and now
she has been induced to come southwards to bring
a new species of Thrill to a waiting continent.
Next is the famous sensational diver Mr.
Charles Peart, whose dive from the roof of the
Antwerp Exhibition 7 is now a historical event of
international importance. Here is a description
of this marvellous leap :
Up, up, high above the sea of faces, to a little platform
just below the glass roof of the building, a man in th.
costume of a diver is slowly beimr hoisted. He settles
himself upon the scanty planking, whilst beneath him the
spectators are hushed into silent wonder at the daring of
the feat. Ah !he springs into mid-air, and then, with the
swoop of a bird upon its prey, falls rapidly to earth. Will
he accomplish his self-imposed task in safety, or will he
crash into the rows of chairs which hedge round the little
tank of water the diver has for his destination? This is
the thought which flashes simultaneously through the
mind of every spectator. An indefinable murmur of
relief runs through the gathering, for the diver strikes
the water with the velocity of an express, throws up a
cloud of spray, and then, streaming with water, he bows
his acknowledgments of the applause which greets his
successful accomplishment.
Peart says that the sensation of flying through the
air is exquisite, and, indeed, beyond description.
When he leaps fronv his little platform he sees
nothing, but as be falls he directs himself towards
the tank by waving his arms as though they were
wings, and using his head as a steering apparatus.
Sometimes he has found himself flying clean out of
his course on to the surrounding seats, and he has
to rectify this by a powerful effort of .bis arms.
Last of the three star engagements made by the
Fitzgerald Brothers is the famous Mahomet, the
“talking horse,” and his trainer, Professor
Probasco. This semi-human wonder is supposed
to be a native: of somewhere out Bathurst way,
and was taken when very young to America by
Mr. Dick Kenna, in company with several pug-
nacious marsupials. While there, Professor Pro-
basco discovered the secret of how to make a horse
talk without saying anything, and after the
education of the beast was completed he made his
first appearance at the Chicago World’s Fair. If
one were to describe this beast even as the prince
of trick horses, his trainer would be very much
insulted. He insists, and will maintain it before
any number of learned societies, that the horse can
think, and conveys the results of his education to
the audience in a way which cannot be mistaken.
He adds, subtracts, divides, and multiplies like a
bank-manager, and tells the time by any watch
like a policeman, the day of the month, the year,
&c. If a bell is rung a certain number of times,
he will rap out ever so quickly the same number
with his hoofs upon the stage. In London this
horse has been the rage and the wonder for 18
months, showing at several music-halls on the one
evening. Those who have seen his performances
tell stories of them which, to the sceptical mind,
appear incapable of belief, but if even half of them
are inm the horse must be the eighth wonder of
the world.
These bright particular stars will be backed up
by a company of minor stars who will flicker
round and fill up the chinks. Further, the famous
cornet soloist, Herr Von der Mehden, will uplift
the whole performance into a melodious heaven
with a band composed of specially picked men.
The firm are bringing out several novelties in the
shape of clowns’ acts, mechanical comicalities, &c.
When it is added that there will he trapeze, aerial,
globe and acrobatic acts, all new and from the
cream of the European theatres and circuses, the
public of Australia may expect to **e a perform-
ance unparalleled in I hi' history of “ shows ’’ since
the first white man « t ashore on the island con-
tinent of New Holl ■ ;> I.*

In the high-jumping contests at Brisbane exhi-
bition, the horse Spoudulix and the Tenterfield mare Best
Girl lied for first place with jumps of 6ft. 2in. It will
interest The Bulletin's English friends, however, to learn
that horses as jumpers are found to be comparative
failures in Australia, where most of the steeplechases
are now won by trained working-bullocks, many of
which sure-footed animals can easily carry a 14st. man
across a 7ft. fence. Though a little slow on the flat, their
marvellous prowess over timber more than equalises
things. As a proof of the trained bullock's cross-country
abilities, it is notable that during the past steeplechase
season not one jumping bullock has fallen at a hurdle in a
public race, nor is there on record one case of injury sus-
tained by a bullock-rider. Many of the bullock-jockeys
are Chinese, and the leading one is a Sunday-school
superintendent—or was, until lately.

Another jockey killed in a Vic. steeplechase.
Sport of kings—and of undertakers! So familiar are such
events that women, who would faint at the sight of a
pug.’s nose bleeding in a set-to, make no sign when a
smashed-up steeplechase jockey is carted off the course
to the hospital and the grave.

“Jack ” Brewer’s Bill, like Rosetem, a recent
purchase, by winning the Y.C. Hurdle-race returned his
owner’s purchase-money with profit. Brewer’s jumping
string is at present unequalled in Australia.
• « • *
Youngsters sired by Australian horses still have
the call in America. At J. B. Haggin’s sale the highest
priced yearling was a Darebin colt, which brought ±750.
• * * *
A startling race was one at Marong (Vic.) re-
cently. There were five starters, and after the even-
money favorite had run absolutely last his owner entered
protests against three of the others for not being district
horses. The}’ were disqualified, and then he protested
against the remaining one for having run on an un-
registered course. Case adjourned ; but it looks as if the
last horse will get the stakes.

An Australasian “Racing Chronicle,” in
monthly parts at a shilling a lime, is making ready to
issue from the office of J. J. Miller, Melbourne, under
Miller junior’s editorship. This live periodical threatens
to exterminate the “Turf Register,” which costs 30s. in
a lump, and comes out only once a year. The subscription
to Miller’s venture will be “arf a quid” per annum,
whilst in point of usefulness to horsey creatures who
desire to keep themselves posted up to date, it will be
absurdly valuable. A neat and easy system of indexing
each horse’s monthly performances is revealed by the
spi cimen sheets lo hand, and the printing has much finer
qualiiies than the average reader of such immoral litera-
ture.

The totalisator in France last year raked in
£208,000 for the charities and £104,000 available for the
encouragement of the breeding of thoroughbreds. The
machine in use is a beauty—it allows of backing for a
win or a place, and has automatic registers keeping one
copy of the record for the club and one for the Govern-
ment auditors.
• * * *
Anti-tote arguments. “A race-crowd starting
with £lO,OOO would only have £4OO left at the end of the
second day’s meeting, the remainder having gone to the
machine.” The amount is got at in this rough-and-ready
way—B per cent, on £lO,OOO = £BOO, and twelve times this
would be £9600. As a matter of fact, there would be £3684
of this ±lO,OOO left after being twelve times through
the machine. But a crowd of people with £lO,OOO
don’t tush and put all on the tote. No man puts the
whole of his capital on one horse, or one race. He keeps
something for the next, and the next; consequently, the
extortionate-percentage cry is sent kite high. Again, it
is asserted that while the machine takes 8 per cent., the
average bookmaker works for the modest average of
2 per cent. If this be so, what objection can there be to
the machine? What is to prevent bookmakers standing
beside it and offering tote odds, and a shade over? They
would get plenty of business, and still make considerably
over 2 per cent.
• * ♦ •
Some unpleasantness always turns up (remarks
Tins Bulletin’s London correspondent) when foreign crews
come to Henley. This time the trouble was with the
Cornell University eight in the Grand Challenge. They
had to meet the Leander—this year a really splendid
crew. When the boats were at the starting-point, the
umpire called out, as usual, “Are you ready?” and at
once gave the word “Go." It happened that the Leander
men were anything but ready, and when the Cornell
boys went off at a terrific bat the Englishmen did not
attempt to move, and the umpire did not call the Yankees
back. They accordingly went on alone, and, despite a
protest, were declared the winners. It might have been
expected that, when they saw they had started alone,
they would have come back to the starting boat ; but
such a thing seems not to have occurred to them, nor
when Mr. Willan, who knew he had made a blunder,
offered a cup —value 100 guineas—to be rowed for by' the
two boats on the last day of the regatta, would they
agree to try conclusions with Leander. Much bad
feeling was thereby created, and hard things were said,
though the Cornell men were quite within their rights.
However, they did not profit much, for in the next heat
the Trinity Hall (Cambridge) crew beat them fair and
square, the Americans, with their quick, snappy, short
stroke, being rowed to a standstill at a mile. The St.
John’s (Oxford) crew behaved in a much more sportsman-
like manner in the final for the Ladies’ Cup, for when one
of the Eton boys caught a crab at the third stroke after
starting, young Martin (son of the late N.S.W. Chief
Justice)at once stopped rowing and went hack fora fresh
start, for which he was rewarded by losing the race.
Young Martin, by the way, did not quite succeed in
achieving the highest honor which row ing men aspire to,
i.e., stroking the Grand Challenge winning crew at Hen-
ley, but he did very well for John’s (Oxford) by getting
second in the Ladies’ Challenge and getting well npin the
Stewards’ Cup. Mr. J. Spencer Brunton, of Sydney, had
rattier a nice house-boat at Henley in a good position,
and he entertained a number of guests everyday. Mr.
George Cheeke also was much in evidence, he having a
house near the river. Australians were to be seen galore
at every coign of vantage.
The “ Argonaut ” Toronto four, described as
the Champions of Canada and America, found a London
R.C. crew, stroked by Guy Nickalls, too many guns for
them. Rowers from across the water, with their short,
snatchy stroke and arm-work, are at a disadvantage
(writes The Bulletin's London correspondent) in com-
peting with the long swing of Thames oarsmen. Nor are
swivel rowlocks any advantage in rowing, whatever they
may be in sculling. A Dutch crew from Amsterdam
University showed to great advantage in the Stewards’
Cup, which they won easily. They pull a long, dragging,
effective stroke, and their victory was heartily cheered.
• * * *
Nobody has asked the Australian eleven to
England yet, and, therefore, the Sydney and Melbourne
cricket authorities are waiting. It was generally under-
stood that Marylebone C.C. was taking the visit for
granted, and that the Australian cricket powers were
taking it for granted, too. The latter have thought it
better to indirectly cable for the invite, otherwise a certain
Adelaide potentate might begin working up a surprise
party. That potentate never says ‘‘Please may I!” but
always, “ I’m coming, and you’ll enjoy yourself.”

No man ever captained an Australian eleven
like Murdoch. His fairness and good judgment naturally
fitted him for the post. He is the only Australian cap-
tain whom the whole side obeyed without murmur or
protest.

The Australian cricketer who has saved more
money than any other out of the proceeds of the
Australian eleven trips Is said to be Alec. Bannerman.

Stoddart,. Brown, and Brockwell have done
badly in the English season directly following their Aus-
tralian tour. M'Laren has done one or two sensational
things, but has generally failed. Ward and Richardson
are the only two who have played consistently up to
form. Brown and Stoddart, in getting into the way of
Australian wickets, have perhaps forgotten the English
style and cannot pick it up again. Brockwell apparently
forgot English style and never learnt Australian.
* * ♦ *
W. G. Grace, senior, headed the list of first-
class English batting averages np to July 1 with BTI runs
an innings; W. G. Grace, junior, came 56th with 25*1.
Abel was second with 69 ; Murdoch thirtieth with 33'15.
What has become of the delusion that Mmdoch was a
second Grace? The champion is much older than Mur-
doch, and, so far this season, nearly half a century per
innings a better man.

“ Jim ” Phillips, who umpired and sub-managed
for Stoddart’s last team, combines the cricketer, agent,
globe-trotter, sporting correspondent, boxer, wrestler,
club-swinger, fencer and oarsman in the one 16st. six-foot
man, 35 years old and 46J round the chest. He is one of
the best all-round professional cricketers, and has done
big things, such as 6 for 20 in the ’9O match, N.S.W. v.
Victoria, and 6 for 39 in Vic. v. S. Aus. in ’93. He has
business capacity, too, as is proved by his being able to
make his life one round of summer—staying in England
for the summer there, and coming to Australia to get
regularly browned by his own native Vic. sun.

Parson A. P. Bladen, of Warragul, Vic., once a
great footballer, has not forgotthen his old love. Preach-
ing on football last month he took a text punningly
beginning “I press towards the mark .” According
to the rev., football is a noble game, making a man quick
of decision and quick of action ; the field is a fine school
for control of temper, and the necessity of giving a little
mark to the goal-sneak instead of going for the glory him-
self teaches a player unselfishness and sets an example to
the crowd.

Veteran “Billy” Warbriok’s football record :
Collar-bone broken twice, arm broken once, bones of
hand broken once, shin splintered twice, laid out a dozen
times, innumerable cuts and bruises. Warbrick gives,
as the first essentials of a good Rugby man, complete
absence of fear and total disregard for personal safely.
There’s no other way to play Rugby, he says.

Muhleisen, the Maoriland cyclist who lately
rode from Brisbane to Sydney in 5 days 18i hours,
lowering the previous record by 13J hours, persevered with
rare pluck and endurance. At one stage he fell and
sprained his ankle ; this mishap caused the next 14 miles
to occupy 10 hours, and for some time after this he could
only use one pedal. The last 84 hours he rode without
sleep. He will yet pay dearly for this sort of thing.

Possibly the only wild-turkey (bustard) hunter
in N.S.W. lives at Broken Hill. During the six months
open season ending with July he bagged 432 turkeys,
which were sold at an average of ss. each, thus returning
the shooter £i per week throughout the season. All the
birds were killed within a radius of 20 miles of Broken
Hill.

What is the position of a bondman when
the person for whose appearance in Court on a
fixed date he has become surety suicides mean-
while? That question puzzled Melb. Bench theother
day. W. Rosier went surety for a man charged
with stealing guns, and accused shot himself ab
the earliest opportunity. Rosier wanted his money
back, and offered to produce the body as a guaran-
tee of good faith. The Bench was dubious.
Which goes to show that no man is safe in stand-
ing surety for another unless he is content to take
him home, lock him up in a burglar-proof safe,
and feed him through the keyhole, pending the
delivery of his corpse into the hands of the law.
But, after all, the Bench was an ass. Rosier didn’t
go bail for the man’s soul, but only for his body,
which was on hand.

Sir —J hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies

your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. lhanking you for your

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. . August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, &nd
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity. „„ . „

Dear Bulletin,—My mate, Jimmy the
Unck, has hard luck. He ekes out a living on an
old alluvial held where he was a rich man in the
titties. When he does get a few weights, lie
drowns his sorrows in the township, and generally
varies the monotony of returning to camp by fall-
-IUK down some abandoned hole, from which, as a
rule, ho is hauled by a passer-by, or else lies there
till morning. Last Saturday night Jimmy
manage< to reach home, but being too drunk to
hnd his bed, he Jay on the floor of his hut with I
his head in the ashes of the fireplace. Towards I
morning he woke up, and seeing the stars shinim* !
overhead exclaimed: “Down a blanky hole
•igam ! He pulled himself together, and with
great caution managed to get up to the top of the
chimney by bracing himself against the sides.
When there he immediately fell down to the I
ground outside. “ The domed place!” says'
•Jimmy ■ its all holes altogether. I’ll stop here
till morning.” Which he did.—Croyez.
Dear Bulletin, — Manna is commonly said
by bushmen and naturalists to be hardened san
exuded from gumtree twigs after the locust, or.
rather, the cicada, has sawn a groove in them and
deposited eggs therein. (It should be noted that
true locusts have long saw-edged hind legs with
which they make their mnsio by “fiddling” on
the raised edges of the wing-covers, while the
cicada makes its song with sound-drums on the
sides of the body, the two dark covers of which
can easily be seen at the junctions of the wiun-
covers with the body. That by the wav )
Chemist A, A. Simpson, of Walol.a, is denying
this vigorously, and declaring that the locust is an
impostor, and that the manna is really exuded by
little aphides or blight-insects found on various
plants limes, maple*, alders, roses, gums, See,
I he fact seems to be that both are right, only they
are talking of two different kinds of manna
Ihere are four mannas really : (1) the manna of
the pharmacopoei, which is an exudation from the
scarified bark of the manna ash omits) j
(2) mannas like the Australian, produced by cicadas
from eucalypts and ash trees; (3) mannas like the
oak, the Kurdistan and the Tamarisk mannas,
produced by the punctures of small insects, such as
bhghts, plant lice and leaf fleas; (4) mannas like
the Spanish, which are spontaneously exuded.
Ibe Australian bushman is, therefore, right about
the cicada-produced mannas of the mountain and
peppermint gums, while Mr. Simpson is abo right
a out ins a phis-prod need mannas. It is worthy
of note by hush-dwellers that manna is an excellent
laxative, much preferable, for weak sub-
jt-cts,-to cast fr oil, eto. The aboriginals knew

Longmore, M.L.A., says truly that the
brovennnent is responsible for the sale of inferior
spirits m Victoria, being morally bound lo bar
poison at the Customs, To which the old old
reply—revenue. With the duty upon whisky
standing at 3s. 9d. per quart, and the price of
discretionary nobblers from the hotel bottle re-
maining at 6d. as of yore, the Government must
either pass “vile stuff ” or kill the trade. The
one possible way out of the difficulty is never sug-
Rested. An Act enforcing the sale of spirits
by measure, instead of from the bottle as at
present, would give publicans a chance to deal
fairly with the public. Why not adopt the system
ot hills cafes, where spirits are brought to you in
graduated flasks? When you have had your drinks
the waiter comes and holds the flask to the light
sees how much has been consumed, and charges'
accordingly. At present, temperate people snHer
not because the quantity of their drinks couldn’t
be supplied in a fair quality at the price, but
because the ether fellows want more value out of
the bottle than they are piutmg into the till.
Peter suffers that Paul may swill, and the
thirstiest creatures, who would he the best cus-
tomers under the measurement system, are the
worst of customers now that the bottle is at their
mercy. The temperance apostle is an utterly un-
practical sniveller, or he would protest against
go-as-you-please drinking long ago.

‘ THE LAST OF SIX. 1
A medical view of modern fiction. “Among
physicians, ‘The Heavenly Twins’ is looked upon,
not as a literary venture to be judged by artistic
standards, but as a readable presentation of symp-
toms which suggest definite pathological condi-
tions. ‘Snips that Pass in the Night’ is admirable
as a pulmonary record, and ‘ The Yellow Aster ’
affords an insight into the psychic phenomena
insulting from neglect of natural instincts and
desires, which, surviving the appropriate period
of life, subsequently assert themselves in the form
of belated maternal love and ex pout facto philo-
progeiiitiveness. As to Miss Harraden’s book
while we find it useful for its glimpses into refined
sick-room conversation and pulmonary perxiflaue,
we regret, from a medical point of view, that after
giving such a careful history of the heroine’s case,
the author permitted her to be killed by an
omnibus. It is humiliating, after following
attentively the course of the disease and the
method of treatment, to be dismissed without
hearing the result of the autopsy. Moreover, we
found her style so delightful that we would gladly
have followed the hero to his last haemorrhage;
but that, too, was denied us. Sarah Grand’s
cases are open to the same complaint of incom-
pleteness, but with a little more clinical experi-
ence we have no doubt that her future novels will
be above reproach. She will stand unchallenged
as the novelist of venereal diseases, just as Du
Maurier is first in the fields of hypnotic romance,
and Beatrice Harraden in the department of
laryngeal and pulmonary complaints. There is
danger lest writers will attempt to cover too
wide a pathological area in their novels. The
speeialistic tendency must prevail iu medical
fiction, or the results will be unreliable and super-
ficial. There are neurotic episodes in Mrs.
Grand’s otherwise consistently venereal work,
which we cannot condone. There will be time
enough for the combination of various ailments in
a single work when each of the departments of
pathology has its special novel. We have no
novel of the ear, no drama of the digestive organs,
no romance of the kidneys, no pastels of the
intestines ; and these are only a few of the count-
less fields for literary and artistic honors.” —

Though the provincial governments of
Maoriland have been swept away, the Maori-
landers are still provincial in thought and deed.
Provincialism seems to cling to the character of the
community like the sins of the fathers. The Central
Government has to legislate for a crowd which
has, or fancies it has, the most hopelessly conflict-
ing interests imaginable. If public works are
mooted for the North Island, there is oue dis-
cordant howl from the Bluff to Cape Campbell to
the effect that the South is being shamefully
neglected. Then if the Labor Department pro-
pones to convey a hundred or two unemployed to
the North, every inhabitant of the latter rises up
and yells. An Auckland stipendiary sarcastically
remarked from his seat on the licensing-bench, the
other day, that those publicans who desired greater
freedom in the-matter of extinguishing lights out-
side their premises than the Auckland laws allow
should shift to Wellington—the inference being,
of course, that at the seat of the Central Govern-
ment people may do as they “dtimed well please.”
Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch pubs,
close at 11 p.m., but at Dunedin they shut at 10.
Tiie northern prohibitionists and the like wail a
mournful wail, and exasperate their neighbors by
everlastingly pointing to Dunedin as a noble
example, while confusion is worse confounded by
the whisky-sellers of the southern town wanting
to strangle Premier Seddon & Co.' for allowing the
northern pubs, an undue ad vantage. Maoriland
daily newspapers are seldom seen outside tlieir
own province, though Australian dailies are on
sale everywhere. In Christchurch, by the way,
the hotels, and not doctors, monopolise
the red light, the lads who parade the
street at night do so in all the glory
of bell - bottomed pants and wide - brimmed,
soft-felt hats turned in atthe crown in a doublefold,
as worn by the Melbourne larrikin of 20 years ago ;
in _ Wellington the genus cuts a dash in flat-
brimmed bard-hitters; while in Dunedin the
various “pushes” knock around in dog-stealer
caps and flavour “colonial ” slang with a strong
Scotch accent. The votaries of each style naturally
regard all the other styles with scorn and derision.
Cricket and football teams still struggle for glory
with men picked from within the old-time pro-
vincial boundaries, but provincialism has its
rcduclio ad ahsurdum (?) in the positive fact that
the shrewdest Canterbury farmers never, by any
chance, inform their neighbors of the nature of
the crop it is intended to plant, for fear the
others would follow suit and glut the market.
Even a popular brand of beer brewed in a
Southern town, which has a considerable sale
in the Noith island, has so far failed to wash
awtiy the provincialisms, for some Northern ass is
periodically and vociferously declaring to all and
sundry that that particular brand of “tangle”
“ ain’t as good as it used to be.” About the only
thing upon which all provinces unanimously agree
is the absolute necessity for annexing the remain-
ing lands of the Maoris.

In the Bush.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HAD lefb the township, with its array of iron
roofs blistering in the sun, its one street of
weatherboard cottages, and its suburb of bark
shanties. Climbing the ridge, I turned to look
back at it all—turned carelessly, for was not the
whole scene familiar to weariness ?
An endless ocean of tree-tops, dingy-green close
at hand, melting to black-blue, grey-blue, and, far
away in the distance, the pale-blue of the sky
itself. A shadeless foliage, Nature’s venetian-
blinds, through which tne white light slanted
Undimmed. The trunks of the gums naked as
though they had stripped for coolness, with here
and there a paddock of ring-barked skeletons—
gaunt, white-armed, mournful.' No diversity, no
break of color. Spring brought no greenness ;
Autumn no russet-reds. Nature hard-up, without
a change of clothes. This was the prospect.
A voice hailed me up: “Say, mate ; is this
Friday or Saturday ? ”
He was seated by the roadside, all of a heap, as
though he had been tipped there and had not yet
stretched himself out. Dusty, with crumpled
clothes, a tomato complexion, Snn-hlistered nose,
bleached whiskers, and bloodshot eyes. He was
handling a bridle.
“You say it’s Saturday, mate? I thought,
somehow, it was Saturday, yet I kind of doubted.”
Then, half to himself : “Monday and Tuesday I
knocked down the mare; Wednesday and Thurs-
day the saddle. Now, what did I drink yester-
day ? ” . . r i. i
He looked 'at me interrogatively, bub I shook
my head.
“ Have you got a drop of something on you? I
want a nip badly to straighten me up.
I handed over rny pocket-flask. His hand
shook so as he filled the cup that half the spirit
was spilt on the ground.
“Thank you, mate ; it’s not much chop in the
way of liquor, but I feel better for it. ’
I protested that rny brandy was the best “three-
star” undiluted,
“May be; I don’t say it ain’t, bub when a
chap’s been filling up with kerosene and vitriol for
a week, three-star is a 'onely kind of drink.”
I risked a word of advice on the evils of intem-
perance—the waste of money and health, the
day’s delirium paid for by a week of horrors, and
soon.
“ It’s no n.«v, mate. I know all jbhak, and a sight
more, and it’s all darned foolishness. Do you
suppose I drink because I like the stuff? Not a
bit of it ; I’d as soon take physic for all the
pleasure the taste gives me. For 12 months
straight-off I take nothing stronger than billy-tea,
and then I get full-np. It’s a dull life away back ;
at one time I counted on leaving it and going into
town again, but when the bush gets hold of a
man it’s like the sea—it’s got you for good. It’s
right in your blood, so to speak. You hate it,
curse it; you cart do anything to it but leave it.
Sooner or later you go back, and the old life com-
mences again. The same tucker, meal after
meal ; muttort and damper washed down'with tea;
the days are the same, and the weeks, and the
months ; and the blasted bush never looks young
and never looks old, with its galvanised limbs and
japanned leaves all the year round. The time
comes when you weary of it—weary with a desolat-
ing weariness, and, most of all, above all, yon
weary of yourself. Weary of that beast of a fel-
low who crawls about only to work, eat and sleep.
You want to have a spell from him, to shut him
up like a book you are tired of, just for a rest.
And there is one way, one simple way of escape.
You can go on a drunk. Then, for a week, that
fellow you are tired of is forgotten ; he just clears
out, and a brand-new man, a different kind of chap
altogether, comes along. He is tall and strong
and handsome, the idol of the women and the
envy of the men ; ho is the cleverest thinker and
the smartest speaker in the country. He knows
all about politics, and the mistakes those fellows
down in Sydney make, that call themselves the
Government. He feels like a king—so big, so
grand ; he talks like a lord, and the words flow
from him he knows riot how. All men are his
brothers. He finds the meanest hang-dog swagman
the finest fellow in the world ; he loves everybody;
he feels a place in his heart open for every mother’s
son of them. The whole world looks different to
his eyes, anil even the bush itself is a kind of fairy-
land. That’s the kind of man I am for a week
while it lasts ; and yon say, “keep to moderation.”
I tried it, sonny. One year I went down to
Sydney, saw all the shows, hummed round all the
streets, and at the end of a week I was the
rniserablest man you ever see. I knew nobody,
and nobody knew me; it was worse than the
cursed bush. I tell you. I was full tip, and gave
it brusher. A bushman is like that. If he wants
to leave it, what is he fit for after twenty years of
sheep and black gins? He’s just a fool when he
gets amongst other folks ; and he knows it, feels
it, and curses the day ho humped his swag out
back. He’s chained, riveted, married to the bush ;
and there is no divorce bub death or the rum-
bottle.

HENRY FLETCHER.
A Bulletin correspondent ; —Members of
the Workers’Union in Moree (N.S.W.) district
last year contributed =£6s (over one-fourth of total
contribution) to the local hospital funds. Yet for
this they get no representation on the committee
of fifteen—not even a subscriber’s ticket ; tint have
to go cap-in-hand to some local bigwig whenever
a man wants admission.
It is related that the proprietors of a lead-
ing W. A. rag-shop always start the morning’s
work with an employes’ prayer-meeting. The
senior partner begins by thanking God for the
previous day’s good business (if it has been bad,
the fact is mentioned, and a hope expressed that
an improvement will he shown), and there is
generally a special supplication for the cashier, who
must feel his prominence rather significant.
A rag-trade tale bearing on the question
of fixed duties. When flannelette was just coming
into popular favor in Maonland, 15 years or so
ago, the stuff was being used then as now for
ladies’ lawn-tennis dresses, &0., as well as for
men’s cheap shirts. A Wellington importer, fore-
seeing a boom in the novel material, brought out
an extensive order. Duties on dress material
vyere then high ; and on ruoh matters as men’s
shirting conspicuously low. Coming to the
Customs with a prudent mind, he listed his
assignment as shirting to secure the lower duty.
Quoth the official, “ IFe call it dress material;
but if you prefer to press it as shirting we will cut
it up and deliver in 2Jj-yd. lengths ! ” The Govern-
ment had just made it worth the while of a pro-
minent soft-goods importer to accept the post of
Customs expert, arid that was one of the many
instances in which his special knowledge did good
service.

Dear Bulletin, —The instant the Aus-
tralian “ pote ” touches either botanical or zoo-
logical subjects he becomes a massive wreck.
E.g. : “ The Breaker ” in his “In Such a Night.’’
His “drooping myall,” “stately pines,” and
“massy blood woods ” are boxed up in one im-
possible arid indiscriminate jungle. In the name
of the mysterious platypus, whom is he writing
for? IF “The Breaker” can show me a blood-
wood (Eucalyptus sp.) and a myall ( Araria pend u fa)
growing, in a natural state, together I’ll hang
myself on either he chooses ! I wonder if he ever
saw—other “ potes ” have —the lyre-bird (Mevvra
suj crhn) and the emu (D. none hoUandice) dam-big
together on the plains of Bourke or Coonamble? —

Those who recollect Henniker Heaton’s
brilliant descriptive articles in the Down AND
Gumtree Jernil will doubtless at once recognise
the hand of The Master in the following extract
from an article in the North American Review
on the subject of penny cablegrams, which pur-
ports to be written by Heaton :
Two generations ago a heaven-sent genius took pity on
the two great sister-nations of the Anglo-Saxon stock,
dwelling isolated and apart, fnr ever sundered by the
wide, tempestuous ocean. A slender wire was laid across
the depths of the watery abyss, and an end of this wire
was placed in the hand of either sister. “ Now, speak,”
said their benefactor, “as if yon were face to face. Share
yonr joys, sympathise with each other’s sorrows.”
Being short of one in the crew, at 'Frisco,
Shanghai Brown, the runner, obtained a corpse,
carried it aboard as dead drunk, put it in a bunk
and placed alighted cigar in its month, explaining
to the mate that “he would be all right in the
morning.” As they heaved anchor and got under
weigh at once, the ghastly fraud was not dis-
covered till out at sea.
M’Gregor, M. P. for Ballarat East, seeks
to prevent municipal disenfranchisement for non*
payment of rates. Sundry local bodies protest-
The measure is in the interests of the multitude
who pay their rates indirectly. The occupier of
any property is responsible for rates as well as the
owner, but the custom of contracting for the land-
lord to pay rates is so general that the mere occu-
pier seldom knows the way to the rate-office.
When he wants to vote, he perhaps finds that ho
is off the roll through the carelessness or default
of his landlord. The present system throws the
onus of Securing a vote on the individual rate-
payer —M‘Gregor’s Bill will put that onus on the
paid officer of the municipality. The machinery
for collecting rates is quite sufficient without the
disenfranchisement penalty, which generally falls
on the wrong man. As an illustration of the ease
of enforcing paytm nt of rates, Collingwood Coun-
cil recently had 150 cases. Summonses were
issued, and 00 settled out of court. The remain-
ing 60 were decided by the Bench in a batch on
one day.
"Hard Luck. "
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the bar of a Lonsdale-street hotel, the flay
after Melb, Cnp. Onr “ system ” hail as usual
failed, and we were bewailing onr hard luck. At
the mention of “ hard hick ” an old sWagman,
affectionately hugging his pint-pot, and evidently
on his once-a-year city spree, roused up :
“ Look ’ere, young fellows ; you might talk
about hard luck if y’d passed through what I
have.’’
“ Passed through a lot of beer, for one thing, I
suppose,” said a punter.
“Ay, and seen more than a town battler like
yon’s ever likely to. The ship I come out in was
wrecked. Managed to get hold of a piece of
timber, and was washed on to a barren island.
Had to live on shellfish for six blessed days before
I was found ; and it froze every night. And yet
you talk about hard luck !
“ After this worked for a cocky for four months,
but he wouldn’t pay my wages ; so I guv him a
hidin’. Was brought before a beak and given six
months’ straight off, before I could speak. And
yet you talk about hard luck !
“ Another time in Queensland ; got paid off a
job with 30 notes ; sewed ’em up in my swag ;
shook a dingey, and was makin’ down the river
when a flaming big crockydile upset the boat,
grabbed my swag and dis’peared with it. Got
away alive, but lost everything. And yet you
talk of hard luck !
“I got on purty well at one time for abpn’six
year. Had a little farm, was married, and had
two kids. Cut off three fingers feeding a chaff-
cutter, one day. Same week, wife died suddenly.
When I got back from the funeral, both children
was drowned in the well. That night, house was
burnt down ; the two dead bodies roasted, and I
escaped in my shirt and pants. And yet you talk
of hard luck i
“ About two year ago, got bushed in the
Dividing Range :no tucker for three days. Came
on a deserted hut ; found a little flour in a hag ;
shook it out on a box, and wont down to the river
for some water. When I come back the wind had
blown the flour away. And yet you talk of hard
luck !
“Up in Bendigo once, fell from a horse, and
broke my arm ; was making for homo, leading the
nag, when I put my foot in a crab-hole ; horse
jerked the reins, and broke my leg. Got on him
again ; and was chucked a second time. Broke
collarbone, two ribs, and—”
We left.

Apropos the dumping down in Australia,
as rulers, of alleged British noblemen, Labouchere
waxes warm. Taking for his direct text the
Hampden appointment, he quotes Napoleon, who
sneeringly compared a mere figure-head ruler to a
pig in a sty ingloriously fattened. “ What would
he have thought of a deputy pig in a deputy glass
sty, absolutely powerless, bound by his office not
even to express an opinion on things political, and
passing all his days surrounded with a bastard
imitation of regal etiquette? ”

The Vagabond .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
White handkerchiefs wave from the short,
black pier
As we glide to the grand old sea—
But the song of my heart is for none to hear
If none of them wave for me.
A roving, roaming life is mine—
Ever by field or flood—
For not far back in my father’s lino
Was a dash of the gipsy blood.
Flax and tussock and tern,
Gum and mulga and sand,
Reef and palm—but my fancies turn
Ever away from land.
Strange wild cities in ancient state,
Range atid river and tree,
Snow and ice. But ray star of fate
Is ever across the sea.
A god-ttke ride on a thundering sea,
When all hut the stars are blind—
A desperate race from Eternity,
With a gale-and-a-half behind.
A jovial spree in the cabin at night—
A song on the rolling deck—
A lark ashore with the ship in sight
Till—a wreck goes down with a wreck.
A smoke, and a yam on the deck by day,
When life is a waking dream,
And care and trouble so far away
That out of your life they seem.
A roving spirit in sympathy,
Who has travelled the wide world o’er—
My heart forgets, in a week at sea,
The trouble of years on shore.
A rolling stone ! —’tis a saw for slaves—
Philosophy false as old—
Wear out or break, ’neath the feet of knaves,
Or rot in your bed of mould !
But Td rather trust to the darkest skies
And the wildest seas that roar
Or die—where the stars of Nations rise—
In the stormy clouds of war.
Jleave to your country, home, and friends—
Die in a sordid strife—
You can count your friends on your fingers’
ends,
In the critical hours of life.
Sacrifice all for the family’s sake.
Bow to their selfish rule !
Slave till your big, soft heart they break,
The heart of the family fool.
Domestic quarrels, and family spite,
And your Native Land may he
Controlled by custom, hut come what might,
The rest of the world for me !
I’d sail with money, or sail without
(Let the lip of scorn be curled),
If you dare enough, and your heart is stout,
You can travel all over the world.
I’ve never a love that can sting my pride,
Nor a friend to prove untrue ;
For I leave my love ere the turning tide,
And my friends are all too new.
The curse of the powers on a peace like ours,
With its greed and its treachery !
A stranger’s hand, and a stranger land,
And the rest of the world for me.
But why be bitter ? The world is cold
To one with a frozen heart.
New friends are often so like the old,
They seem of the past a part.
As a better part of the past appears,
When enemies, parted long,
Are come together in kinder years,
With their better nature strong.
I had a friend, ere my first ship sailed—
A friend that I never deserved—
For the selfish strain in my blood prevailed,
As soon as my turn was served.
And the memory haunts my heart with
shame—
Or, rather, the pride that’s there—
In different guises, but soul the same,
I meet him everywhere.
I had a chum. When the times were tight
We starved in Australian scrubs ;
We froze together in parks at night,
And laughed together in pubs.
And I often hear a laugh like his,
From a sense of humour keen,
And catch a glimpse in a passing phiz
Of his broad, good-humoured grin.
And I had a love—’twas a love to prize—
But I never went back again ...
I have seen the light of her kind brown eyes
In many a face since then.
The sailors say ’twill be rough to-night,
As they fasten the hatches down.
The south is black, and the bar is white,
And the drifting smoke is brown.
The gold has gone from the western haze,
The sea-birds circle and swarm —
But we shall have plenty of sunny days,
And little enough of storm.
The hill is hiding the short black pier,
As the last white signal’s seen,
The points run in, and the houses veer,
And the great bluff stands between.
So darkness swallowed the far white speck,
On many a wharf and quay.
The night comes down on a restless deck,
Grim cliffs—and—The Open Sea !

Dear Bulletin, —Your theory that fat is
reserve force is but a surface truth, or rather a
mistaking of effect for cause. Fat is largely
attributable to temperament, and the “reserve
force ” is really the temperament of which fat is
the outward and visible sign. The typical fat
man is complacent, narrow in sympathy, and
callous to things not directly affecting his own
ego. H erein lies his strength, and as he offers
fewer points for friction than the nervous, strenu-
ous, and more sympathetic lean man, he is—as
per your application—better fitted to withstand
the wear and stress of public and political life.
Francis fCenna’s lines —
The eup of life is honey in the month
Of him in whom the hate of wrong is small;
To him in whom that hate is strong as drought
Tile draught is hitter, and the dregs are gall—
suggests much of the physical evidences of the
two temperaments. The fat man takes little heed
of “the world’s woes throbbing against theshores
of wrong ”so long as they’re not his woes. His
narrowness—of feeling, not of intellect —offers
few joints to Fate’s arrows, hut once let misfor-
tune find a way to his ego and he wilts more com-
pletely and irrevocably than the highly-strung
but more virile lean man. A recent Bulletin
contains illustrations of this! The public have
always been unreasonably partial to the fat man,
ami viewed his faults with a lenient eye. His
vices they rate as follies, ami his follies as pardon-
able weaknesses. He may steal the apples where
the lean man may not look over the hedge. This
foible of human nature has always been sup-
ported by the drama, and, up to lately, by fiction.
The Shaksperian Caesar’s “ lean and hungry ”
Cassius, and “Let me have mmi about me
that are fat,” strike the dramatic key-note.
Jack Falstaff would be hissed off the stage
as a knavish fool, instead of being applauded as a
foolish knave, were he presented as a man of
sinew. The later novelists, though less melo-
dramatic than their predecessors, dive deeper into
the complexity of human nature, and rightly
evince a disposition to transpose the attributes.
Space forbids instances, hut Wilkie Collins’s
“Count Fosco” may lie as a creation im-
possible to the earlier school. The stage, more
dependent on instant popular favor, more con-
servative —and possibly because comedy uses up
the available supply of fat men—lags behind. The
new term, “Fat Man,” has much more than a
figurative significance. Of course, these reflec-
tions are only generalities, and, like all generalisa-
tions on human nature, open to wide exceptions.
I mention this to prevent some particularist from
pointing out the inevitable exceptions, and, to his
own satisfaction, demolishing the argument.
There may be loveable fat men, but, speaking per-
sonally, I never made a friend of one, and always
find myself drifting apart from acquaintances as
they tend to adiposity. How say you / —Yours, B.
At Sea .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The little brig was doing her six knots in style.
Not so bad, considering the knocking-about she
had experienced for the last five days ; and the
“old man” screwed up his hard face into a
satisfied grin as he cocked a wall-eye aloft.
“Not a spar gone—looks queer, though; nasty
wrack flying. Those tops’ls might as well come
in,” he mused for an instant before roaring the
order.
It was the mate’s watch, and as the men sprang
into the ratlines he was before any of them.
The old man grinned, for the mate was his only
son, and had the freehold of the one soft spot in
his wicked, worldly old heart, seared by memories
extending from Number Nine to Bowsprit Lane.
The skipper glanced once at the wrack astern,
against whose dark grey surface the albatrosses
and molly-hawks doing pilgrimage for the galley-
scraps showed up like saved souls against the
smoke of the pit.
“Look alive, Jimmy!” he growled. Jimmy
grinned down at the old man, and sprang for the
yard. A rotten footrope went.
A moment after the birds astern hovered for a
swoop on the face that gleamed from the dark
rollers. There were no life-buoys, of course; those
are kept for the gaudy passenger-ships. The
solitary boat was staved into matches by yester-
day’s sea.
It seemed hours to the skipper before he had
realised that rescue was hopeless, and his boy must
die. He faintly heard the men aloft yelling
“ Man overboard ! ” and damned them for a set of
howling fools. Then he stepped into the cabin,
and reappeared a moment after with a long rifle
in his hand. Already the birds stooped and
hovered closer over a white spot a hundred yards
astern. The old man’s hand was steady as a rock
as he raised the rifle. For a brief moment the
face astern rose on a wave, fighting with the
winged devils above. There was a sharp, ringing
crack ; and the birds wheeled aloft as an arm shot
above the surface for an instant. The skipper
relaxed his intent gaze and marched back into bis
cabin.
* « •
When he was called up for trial at his
next port, people who had heard the story gazed
curiously on the hard square figure in the dock as
he numbered off each point of his tale with a
finger resembling a short and grimy carrot. And
when the jury returned with their verdict of
“justifiable homicide,’’ his only comment was :
“ Better die mercifully than drown with them
damned halbertrosses picking out his eyes 1 ”
Then the short, square figure stumped out to
rejoin the ranks of the unknown toilers.
MOYABBA.
Spontaneous spasm from an Australian
lady missionary in China: “ The weather is very
hot, and the Chinese are always quarrelsome in
hot weather.” H’m.
