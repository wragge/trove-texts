So? Sony. That’s all. Sony—the name
to look for. To ask for. To insist on
every time it comes to anything as
important as, say, a tape recorder.
After all, Sony created Japan's first all-
transistor radio. First tape recorder.
First transistorised TV, and home video
recorder. Sony is one of the most
looked-up-to names in the whole mir-
acle-filled world of electronic research.
The point of this ad? Just this. If any
brand name sounds like Sony, and it
isn't spelt S-o-n-y, you’re not getting
the best there is. Fair enough? So—say

UNCLEAR
IT WAS INEVITABLE that when the
question of the treatment of conscien-
tious objector Simon Townsend at Hols-
worthy ca’mp was raised in Federal
Parliament, a member of the Govern-
ment would claim that young Austra-
lians serving in Vietnam were getting
worse treatment. However, he did not
make clear whether this was at the
hands of the Viet Cong or the Austra-
lian Army.
TORTURE
WE HEAR that members of the staff
of the ABC were woken at half-hourly
intervals last Thursday night so that
the management could be sure some-
one was watching the Indianapolis 500
beamed by satellite from 1.30 a.m. to
5.30 a.m.
"IN" FISH
OUR MODEST RESEARCHES
lead us to believe that in Sydney the
most popular expense-account lunch
is grilled John Dory and a bottle of
white burgundy. This is borne out by
figures issued by the N.S.W. Fish
Authority. In the year to last Septem-
ber, overall consumption of fish was
down 924,170 pounds, including a
drop of 538,224 pounds for homely
mullet, but John Dory was up 538,224
pounds.
SIGNED
THE latest addition to Harry M.
Miller’s list of diversely entertaining
clients was revealed last week with
uncharacteristic restraint. When we
asked Mr. Miller if the dogs were
correctly barking that he and Mrs.
Zara Holt had signed papers making
him her business manager, he discreetly
murmured, “Yes, it’s true,” but pre-
ferred not yet. to talk about her busi-
ness plans.
THE URGE TO MERGE
THE MATINGS of companies are
often more interesting than those of
celebrities. An exa’mple is the current
merger of Big Sister Foods with the
larger firm of Reckitt and Colman.
On the face of it Big Sister will grow
bigger by “acquiring” the other con-
cern. While Reckitt and Colman will
have control, it will not be known as
Big Brother; nor will Big Sister become
Little Sister.
As a result of the union, she will
find herself in the same family with
Reckitt’s 'blue, Keen’s mustard, Nugget
bootpolish, Brasso, Dettol, Disprin, and
Goya cosmetics. In fact, Big Sister will
be a kissing cousin of almost everyone
except Aunt Mary, Uncle Toby, and
Betty Sydney.
This is in line with the modern trend
known as diversification. It is, of course,
important that the firm should not get
its products mixed up. Reckitt’s have
wisely decided not to attach their blue
image to Big Sister plum puddings.
The diversity of branches will allow
employees to find a niche that suits
them. A polished man can go to Nug-
get, a clean-living man to Dettol, and
so on.
Moreover, it will be possible for
executives to widen their experience.
If a Reckitt’s man feels blue, he can be
sent for comfort to Big Sister. If a
Brasso man is brassed off, he can find
relief in the Disprin division. When
a mustard ’man loses his keenness, he
can freshen up with Goya cosmetics.
And despite the variety of products,
they will all be Big Sisters under the
skin. ROSS CAMPBELL
PLENTY OF FORESIGHT
A GENTLEMAN of our acquaintance
has decided not to discard his some-
what elderly overcoat because its dark
fabric, waisted effect, and long skirts
make him feel rather like Soames
Forsyte.
The BBC television version of “The
Forsyte Saga,” now on the ABC, is
only, as we explained a few weeks ago,
getting in Sydney a respectable rating
of 14 or 15, but its influence is spread-
ing.
Copies of the book are now selling
briskly. When the series was released
in Britain, Penguin reissued it in nine
volumes, each with a colored cover
from the TV version. Penguin here
stocked up in anticipation, but for
the first weeks of the run they
remained on the shelf. Now they are
selling rapidly.
Among the audience for the TV
series are several Jolyons, Soames, and
Fleurs, whose parents were influenced
by the book a generation ago. We sup-
pose in another 20 years or so there
will be some more of them around,
called after characters in a TV series.

NEW LIGHT ON OLD BOOKS
MESSRS. BERKELOUW, antiquarian-
book dealers, recently inserted a discreet
advertisement in the literary pages of
Sydney newspapers.
“We are preparing a catalogue of
rare books on Australiana and other
specialised subjects and containing 1650
items,” it read, adding that the $5
charge for the catalogue applied not to
those already on the bookshop’s mail-
ing list but to new customers.
One thousand people are receiving
free copies of the catalogue some
measure of the fervor of collectors in
this country. Most will be attracted by
the Australiana and may be willing to
pay S6OO for a year’s set of early Tas-
manian newspapers, SIOOO for a sketch-
book full of lithographs depicting life
in the colonies, or $750 for the first
edition of Captain Cook’s Journal of
a Voyage in the Endeavour. A pirated
edition, this is the first printed narrative
of Cook’s discovery of Australia and
was published in 1771, two months
after Cook’s return to England and
well before the official edition was
released.
The book is interesting to collectors,
because it contains an introduction by
Sir Joseph Banks, who removed his

name from subsequent editions of the
book after he learned it was pirated.
A natural history of the insects of
N.S.W., published in 1822 with hand-
colored plates, is selling for $750, while
a copy of the first edition of “Mrs.
Beeton’s Cookbook,” which belonged to
Captain John Piper’s niece Elizabeth,
is a mere $l5O.
A textbook written by a Swiss ob-
stetrician in Latin in 1587 costs SIOOO,
containing as it does flyleaves thought
to be written in the author’s own
script.
Actually, a substantial group of col-
lectors, surprising in their intensity, will
be looking beyond the word “Austra-
liana” in the advertisement to the fine
print of “other specialised subjects.”
Whaling, medicine, and dentistry are
among the most popular and ill-assorted
topics in the Berkelouw catalogue. Some
of the books will be bought by institu-
tions, but there are collectors who would
not be collectors at all but for their
fanaticism as hobbyists pursuing a
specific interest apart from books.
To the bookseller, these people are
ideal as customers, since they are usually
so tenacious about their particular sub-
ject that they are willing to do an
unlimited amount of research on it.
On the other hand, the man who col-
lects books for the sake of being a
collector is often a kind of Toad of
Toad Hall switching to stamps or
motor - boats because he’s suddenly
bored with books.
“These people buy rows of books to
look at, then they lose interest,” says
Isidoor Berkelouw, who established his
King Street bookshop 14 years ago. “I
would rather have a customer who
spends SIOO or S2OO at a time for ever
than S3OOO a time for a little while.”
A customer who answers all .Mr.
Berkelouw’s criteria is a steam-engine
enthusiast who has amassed a unique
collection of early books on the sub-
ject. “He came to me a few years ago
and said he was interested in steam
engines but couldn’t find any worth-
while books about them in this country.
I said I could get them for him from
overseas but that it would cost money.
He said that was all right, so I sent to
some of my overseas contacts for in-
formation, and they sent me back lists
of available books, which I showed to
the customer.
“He told me to go ahead, but I said
that he would have to pay beforehand,
because if he changed his mind I would
be left without a market for the books.
He agreed, and by now I must have
sold that man 800 to 1000 early books
on the steam engine. I’ve advised him
to leave the collection to the country
in his will, and he says he’s going to.
“I find that the people who know
most about books are the easiest to
deal with. They understand prices and
don’t think they’re paying too much.
After they’ve already spent a lot of
time looking for a certain book without
success, they’re aware of its value.”
The cardinal rules for value are age,
rarity, and importance. Editions of
Shakespeare’s works are so numerous
that they have to date back to the
bard’s lifetime to be worth much today,
while fiction is seldom valuable, unless
the circumstances of the book’s publi-
cation make it interesting.
“Perhaps if it were the first children’s
book published in Newcastle, something
like that,” says Mr. Berkelouw with a
fine feeling for obscurity.
He himself has impressive credentials
as an authority on books. He belongs
to the fourth generation of a Dutch
family who have been booksellers for
155 years, and he published a brief
history of the firm on its 150th anniver-
sary.
His ancestor, Solomon Berkelouw,
used to sell theological books in Rotter-
dam to the owners of barques bringing
grain to Rotterdam through the in-
land waterways. A prosperous group,
the barque owners were apparently
bent on self-education, and theology
was in vogue.
Succeeding generations of Berkelouws
built up the Rotterdam concern until
it was destroyed by bombing during
World War 11. The family rebuilt, but
the business was taken over by the
Germans during the Occupation, and
Isidoor Berkelouw’s father, sister, and
brother died. He re-established the firm
in Amsterdam, then in 1948 came to
Sydney, where everybody advised him
that antiquity just wasn’t commercial.
“I took their advice. I went into the
textile business, and I was very suc-
cessful at it I had four frock shops
but I was the unhappiest man in the
whole of Australia. I said to myself
one day, what did you come to Aus-
tralia for? To make money or to be
happy? So I sold out and bought a
property at the bottom end of town
where nobody goes and started as a
bookseller. Everybody thought I was
mad.”
He spent two years accumulating
stock, his sons Henry and Leo joined
him in the business, and he bought the
firm’s present premises in the centre of
the city’s shopping district. The shop
lies between a perfume store and a
take-away food bar its rows of dun-
colored volumes holding a rather more
mysterious appeal, fresh dustjackets or
the crisply slit pages of a new book.
But the showroom is only the tip of
the iceberg. Above it are two storeys
filled almost entirely with rows of floor-
to-ceiling bookshelves, housing, among
other books, the “1650 items” of the
catalogue.
“We bring out one of these cata-
logues every year or so, but this is
probably the biggest one we’ve done.
There’s nothing in it under S2O. I took
the plunge, and I’ve created my own
field. Most of the booksellers here stop
at Australiana, but I’ve got other things,
too Americana, botany, and a col-
lection of early African books larger
than most you’d find in Africa. I try
to get overseas once a year and I’ve got
a market for all these things. For in-
stance, institutions are always building
up their libraries.
“Of course, it’s hard to sell to the
Mitchell and to a university library,
which have been established 50 or so
years, but things turn up. If the
Mitchell Library hadn’t been given such
a great start by two people Dixson
and Mitchell who gave them such
fantastic collections, and if they hadn’t
started amassing things 80 years ago
when they were still floating around,
they wouldn’t have had a hope of
purchase today. Those sort of books
just aren’t turning up anymore, and if
they do they’re too expensive.”

CATERING FOR
FOOTBALL'S
TEETOTALLERS
THE NEWS IS almost too incredible
to report. The Melbourne Cricket
Ground now has a dry area. The no-
liquor area covers three levels of part
of the northern stand, so now 15,000
people at the MCG are as dry as the
nicest areas of Camberwell and Canter-
bury. There are signs all around “NO
BOTTLED OR CANNED LIQUOR
ALLOWED IN THIS AREA.”
This is a remarkable break with
tradition. Even for the first interna-
tional match in 1861, not counting the
claret, gin, rum, whisky, and brandy,
it was reported that the caterers stocked
the entire underneath of the grandstand
with 500 cases of beer. Furthermore,
until the mid-1890s players always were
supplied with champagne at lunch and
tea. On several occasions there were
near-riots because champagne was not
available. Perhaps this is what is wrong

round the bend.
Safely.
Put yourself in the jockey’s saddle.
Your horse is boxed in. He’s hanging
into the running rail. Suddenly 900
pounds of racing machine hits the rail
at 35 miles an hour. A serious accident?
Less likely at the Warrnambool track.
Warrnambool Racing Club in Victoria
has invested in a running rail of gold
anodised extruded aluminium, made
by Alcoa.
Aluminium doesn’t splinter and break on
impact. Its resilience cushions the blow,
reduces the risk of injury.
Installation was significantly faster
than could be achieved with timber.
And cheaper in the long run, because
Alcoa aluminium can’t rust, and never
needs painting.
Alcoa aluminium will put you on the
right track in solving manufacturing
problems, or making the most of your
product opportunities. Just call your
nearest Alcoa Regional Sales Office.

with cricket today—not enough cham-
pagne.
Actually this is the first restriction
since 1906 when the Grey Smith Stand
was built. At that time there were
many complaints that gentlemen had
been seen smoking there, something
very distasteful to the ladies, so the
Grey Smith was declared a “no smok-
ing” stand, whereas a smokers’ stand
was instituted for the gentlemen.
The secretary of the Melbourne
Cricket Club, lan Johnson, said: “This
is purely an experiment by the MCG
committee to protect people from
drinkers at the football. There have
been complaints from people who have
been sprayed with liquor from cans, and
people who object to the language some
drinkers use. If people are staying
away from football because of excessive
drinking at grounds, my committee
thinks they may be encouraged to
return if they know they can watch
from an area where they will not be
pestered.”
So, you see, this is the compromise
for one of the great dilemmas of
modern ground management. There has
always been the fear that if people
were not allowed to bring or buy cans
at the ground they would not go to
the football. Even in the dry area at the
MCG one can still buy beer by the
glass, but this does not please the foot-
ball spectator. For one thing he loses
his possie, for another it is far too
slow and inefficient a method of
consuming beer, and even more im-
portant it is more costly.
One wise correspondent, who remem-
bered the dear old smokers’ stand,
asked why could not Mr. Johnson
erect a drinkers’ stand. This could be
constructed similar to the crying-rooms
which have been installed for mothers
and small babies at all modern picture
theatres. The drinkers’ stand could be
nice and antiseptic for easy washing
down, and, most important, the front
would be of soundproofed plateglass.
Behind this the drinkers could consume
their cans until they were silly, they
could swear, abuse the umpire, abuse
each other, and it would be all superbly
contained inside the soundproofed
drinkers’ stand.
The truth of the matter is that the
taking of cans to the footy has become
a great Melburnian tradition. At most
football grounds, in the Outer by half-
time it is almost impossible to walk,
the whole area is ankle-can-deep.
Please do not blame it all on the Carl-
ton Brewery. Some of them are soft-
drink cans and these times we get
vodka and orange, brandy and dry,
gin and tonic, and even good Beau-
jolais in the can. There is another
reason why cans are important. At
places like the MCG, private grand-
stands such as soapboxes are for-
bidden. So it is the tradition always to
take in at least four cans for one’s
own little stand. Good balance comes
only after years of footy-can watching,
but two cans go under each foot. The


most sophisticated football watcher
might choose to stand on Beaujolais.
A foreigner from Sydney might doubt
the validity of all this, but would he
believe if one pointed out that the
sight of the incredible quantity of cans
at a Victorian ground is a tourist attrac-
tion, almost like the rare sight of the
old six o’clock closing. And the disposal
of these cans has become a major prob-
lem for ground management. What
can be done with the empties? Well,
one restaurant, the Oriental Gourmet
Club, discovered that empty drink cans,
holed at both ends, made an enchanting
roof decoration. Then a garden writer
came up with a solution; dug into the
ground in long rows, they were abso-
lutely marvellous for ground drainage.
Be that as it may, the problem now is,
what will happen at the MCG? If dry
areas spread, will there be footy-sly-
grogging? Already there is an object on
the market which would be ideal for
sly-canning into the MCG. It is a
sponge-rubber cushion in a zipper bag
and in the sponge rubber there are slots
to take six cans. Naturally the whole
affair can be bought in club colors. So
the sly canner can have the pure bliss
of sitting on one’s club and one’s grog
at the same time.
On the first Saturday of the experi-
ment, 23,000 people went to the MCG,
but fewer than 1200 sat in the can-ban
area, which has a capacity of 15,000.
The “Herald” questioned two middle-
aged women who claimed they always
sat in that section. “We have two cans
in our bag, but we don’t know whether
to open them. We feel so guilty,” one
woman said.
Attendance is the basis of the whole
awful problem. The unhappy truth is
that Australian Rules football is a de-
clining sport, with attendances that
have slipped steadily for the past five
years. Nor has this been helped by the
wet, chilly winter. Total attendances
for the sixth and seventh rounds were
100,272 and 101,548. The North
Melbourne-South Melbourne match
was attended by only 7730; the Associ-
ation can do better than that. This is
for a sport that likes to boast it can
draw 200,000 every Saturday.
Meantime the publicity continues and
every Friday night there is an astonish-
ing program on television called
“Sports Parade.” Each week a differ-
ent team has the chance to take part
in a variety show. We have seen Ron
Barassi in a bra. We have seen Ted
Whitten, captain and coach of Foots-
cray, playing the part of Juliet in
“Ro’meo and Juliet,” and we have even
heard Blair Campbell, the Richmond
rover, sing “If I Loved You.” They
have quizzes, too, with opportunity for
footballers to score goals and behinds
according to how they answer ques-
tions.
Actors’ Equity is terribly alarmed
about all this, but if attendances con-
tinue to fall it could make an alterna-
tive to what takes place on Saturday
afternoons. At least it’s warmer in front
of your TV and there’s no restriction
op the number of cans.

tight lines and when he stands he
jiggles a leg to release the clinging
stuff. His grey hair is toothbrush length
and combed forward with a slight lift
at the crown.
The effect of all this on those present
is electric. Not as electric as walking
down Castlereagh Street in his black
mink. Everybody, he says, but everybody
ogled. But electric enough for Bobbie
to know he’s done it again. He sits,
sipping lemonade, he’s on a three-
months-off, three-months-on drink jag,
legs crossed, puffing a cigarette, while
everybody sashays around with their
gins and tonic asking intelligent
Sir Robert Helpmann ... pretty outre
questions about the ballet. Bobbie stares
at one male guest whose hair is eut
exactly like his. Fantastic coincidence.
And another fantastic thing is this man
knows how he felt going round an
abattoir. Bobbie’s on the board of a
meat company. This makes everyone
scream, you know, meat and ballet.
Anyway, they covered up his outre gear
and outre hairstyle with white overalls
and a plastic hat and led him through
the slaughter-house. He kept his eyes
closed the whole time and told them
he never wanted to see anything like
that again. “Yes, and aren’t the sounds
sickening?” sympathises twin hairstyle.
Bobbie shudders. No more. Oh, let’s
go through for dinner, says his hostess.
And sotto voce to everyone, call him
Bobbie, do.
But they don’t. It is easier to avoid
the issue and call him nothing. Bobbie,
on the other hand, brings the whole bit
out. “I have a friend who, when I got
knighted, said, ‘Oh, my God, you’ll be
unbearable.’ But actually the only time
I can’t bear it is when awful people
call me Bobbie or Mr., and I say, icily,
you mean Sir Robert.” Mind you, a title
has its advantages: free excess baggage
on air trips, for instance. “Oh, come
on, I know I’m overweight,” he says
to one of these baggage men the other
day. “It’s perfectly all right, Sir
Robert, you can go through.” Everyone
laughs and says how amusing, flying
with all that extra free luggage.
Actually, a clairvoyant called Fiona
predicted his knighthood in a woman’s
magazine, and he nearly died. Well,
that’s put the cap on that, he thought,
but it hadn’t. “I don’t suppose the
Lord Chamberlain in London actually
reads Australian magazines,” says a
guest who earlier told Bobbie that his
last memory of him many years ago
was seeing him do exercises at the end
of his bed.
On the other hand, a title has its
drawbacks: you know, people think
you’re loaded. He once admired two
plates during lunch with the Queen of
Thailand and next day the waiter
arrived at his hotel door saying choose
which you like. No, no, go away, says
Bobbie, I’ve no money, honestly, every-
one trying to sell me things. But the
waiter meant choose, it’s a gift from
the Queen. And the whole service
arrived with only one piece broken.
Wasn’t that nice?
Well, they’re all thinking, not much
of a disadvantage that, but it’s not
a bad story. Bobbie’s bubbling with
stories tonight, and everyone’s concen-
trating trying to remember them for
retelling to their friends. There’s not
much point spending an evening with
Sir Robert Helpmann if you can’t pass
on some of those lovely biting things
he says. Especially the bits about the
Adelaide Festival of Arts and the way
he got rid of all those committees. He’s
director for 1970, and if it’s gonna
flop, he says, it’ll be his flop and no
one else’s. He has already signed up
Larry Olivier and the National
Theatre, the Australian Ballet, a
Mexican art exhibition, a Constable

FOR SALE: BATTERED
CARAVANSERAI, SUIT
NOVICE VINTNER
I HAVE DRUNK in a good many
hotel bars. My wants are simple and,
apart from quick service, mainly of a
negative kind no race broadcasts,
no entertainment, no pests. Even so it
is not always easy to find a place that
meets these requirements. One may be
in a pest-free bar where someone sud-
denly plays a record of “Georgy Girl”;
or talking in a quiet pub when a
stranger lurches up and says: “Scuse
me, but I’m psychic, I’m a seventh
son of a seventh son, you shee. Now
I’ll tell you something . . .”
My role in hotels is that of a cus-
tomer. I have never been a hotel
manager or even a useful. I have liked
some hotel managers, usually the un-
obtrusive kind. Others I have disliked,
such as the licensee of a Sydney pub
where I had been drinking several
times a week for ten years. One day I
asked him to cash a cheque for a pound.
He looked at me suspiciously and said:
“Who are you?” While aware that my
appearance was not particularly strik-
ing, I had hoped that in the course of
a decade he might have noticed me
around.
However, I did not give much
thought to the problems of hotel man-
agement. Then lately I happened to
see an advertisement published by a
hotel broker. It read: “Suburban lease,
ideal beginner’s hotel; one bar, easily
controlled.” This clearly implied that
hotels demanded widely different
degrees of managerial skill.
I had known a few quiet beginners’
hotels. But I also remembered one in
Darlinghurst with a turbulent clientele,
which I sometimes visited in youth in a
spirit of bravado. When the patrons
came to blows, the manager, a thick-
set man, would jump over the bar
counter and personally throw them into
the street. That must have been a
hotel requiring management at the ad-
vanced or tertiary level.
I felt curious to know more of the
hotel manager’s craft. As a class they
are not markedly communicative, but
there are exceptions. One is Noel
Ottaway, Sydney journalist, who spent
some years running hotels and then
wrote a book about it. I read this
book, a paperback entitled “The Pub
and I,” and found it to be both enter-
taining and informative.
Mr. Ottaway revealed a vista of
little-known administrative difficulties.
For example, that of forming a policy
on raffles for girls. He found that in
more than one of the hotel bars in
his waterfront district unofficial raffles
were held in which temporary droit de
seigneur in respect of a comely young
lady was offered as first prize. At one
place the girl sold the tickets herself.
He heard of a beach hotel where a
second prize, in the form of a more
homely damsel, was available as well.
Mr. Ottaway decided against these
attractions, but at the cost of putting
himself at a competitive disadvantage.
Again, he found that a publican must
determine whether or not to court
certain specialised types of custom. He
cites the case of a licensee whose bar
became a social centre for lesbians.
The arrangement was successful; the
lesbians behaved with impeccable
decorum, and other customers enjoyed
coming to see them. Unfortunately, a
new and inexperienced barman made
advances to one of the more handsome
lesbians, and they all indignantly left
the hotel, never to return.
Then there were various types of
pests to be dealt with bores who
recited Shakespeare, truculent American
seamen armed with knives, men who
declared the beer was poisoned. Police
informers (detectable because they
called the publican “sir”), shady
vendors of stolen scotch (retailed by
some hotels at cut prices), after-hours
trading (a necessary hazard in the
country), the cost of counter snacks,
and the subterfuges of alcoholics Mr.
Ottaway came to know about all these
things.
Thanks to his excellent book I am
better able to understand the differences
between beginners’ hotels and those for
the expert. He creates a vivid mental
picture of the hotel of postgraduate
standard Shakespearian bores and
quarrelsome seamen in the public bar,
police informers and affronted homo-
sexuals in the saloon, a school of nine
businessmen who buy the publican a
glass of whisky and expect a free round
in return, a barmaid who sells her boy-
friend bottles of scotch for the price
of beer, a crooked eellarman down be-
low, and a beautiful ash-blonde being
raffled at the pub across the road.
It would go hard with a beginner
who attempted to manage such an
establishment. Personally I find begin-
ners’ hotels more congenial. I am easily
controlled, and do not mind buying an
occasional ticket in a raffle for a duck.


Should we sign
the Nuclear Treaty?
COMMENT
BY
PETER
SAMUEL
IT WAS QUITE silly for Mr. Whitlam
to suggest that the Australian Govern-
ment should sign the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT in UN
jargon) regardless of what it commits
us to. The NPT needs to be
approached in a careful, analytical
manner.
The first thing to get clear is the
limited nature of the constraints the
Treaty imposes. It is possible within
the Treaty to go to the very threshold
of being a nuclear-weapon State. You
can develop reactors which produce the
plutonium, the chemical plant to refine
it, and you can stockpile the resulting
raw material for bombs. At the same
time you can develop the rocketry or
the planes so that you have a func-
tioning delivery system, and you can go
ahead with design studies for the
“detonator.” There is nothing in the
Treaty which prevents you from doing
research on “weaponising” the detonator
so that it fits into a convenient war-
head, and there is nothing to prevent
you from manufacturing bomb or .war-
head casings. The only prohibition is
on the actual assembly of bombs and
on their testing.
The second important facet of the
Treaty is that the inspection procedures
are likely to be quite perfunctory, prob-
ably something like current Inter-
national Atomic Energy Authority
inspections, mere audits of the books.
Unless there are great advances in
instrumentation, it will continue to be
easy for a determined country to fool
inspectors.
The limited bite of the Treaty means
that it contributes rather little to limit-
ing the spread of nuclear weapons.
Instead of having an increasing number
of countries with assembled, tested,
proven nuclear weapons, we will have
an increasing number with unassembled,
untested weapons, only weeks away
from having fully proven nuclear
systems. It is very arguable whether
this is a contribution to a safer inter-
national" order, since it will increase the
degree of uncertainty about the nuclear
preparedness of potential adversaries.
On the other hand, of course, the
limited bite of the Treaty means that
we can sign without forgoing very much.
Within the Treaty we could go a very
long way to growing nuclear teeth. We
could do everything but sharpen them.
There are a number of costs in not
signing the Treaty. Our relations with
Indonesia and the United States, both
of which strongly support it, would be
somewhat affected for the worse. Our
image as a good UN member and
internationalist would be slightly
harmed, though the claims that we
would be an “outcast” or a “pariah”
are ridiculous (the Treaty has got a
very cold reception in the UN, and
many neutral countries have strong
reservations about it).
We are so backward in indigenous
nuclear technology that for us to have
any sort of useful nuclear capacity
before 1980 we will have to have close
co-operation with a nuclear power. If
we fail to sign the Treaty it is possible
that Britain, the U.S., and Canada, with
whom we co-operate at the moment,
may get tough and refuse us access to
their technology. We might be forced
to go to a non-signer like India, although
a country like Japan, which is quite
unenthusiastic qbout the Treaty, would
probably be prepared to give us help.
To my mind, the greatest point
against signing the Treaty is an internal
political one. To sign the Treaty would
be to nurture in the minds of the Aus-
tralian public a false sense of security,
and to make it politically more difficult
to take measures necessary for national
defence. We cannot at present foresee
the details of a contingency in which
Australia would need nuclear weapons.
But we do know that China will have
a functioning H-bomb system with
intercontinental-range missiles by 1972
at the very latest. Without making
Australia an integral part of the
American nuclear defence system by
having American missiles based on our
soil, as do Germany and Britain, no
American nuclear guarantee to Australia
can count for much. And the Ameri-
cans are simply in no mood to give
us a guarantee as strong as the NATO
countries have.
Both North and South Vietnam are
ahead of Australia in nuclear technology
and it is not inconceivable that by 1972
there could be a Communist Indo-
China on the way to acquiring nuclear
weapons. At some time we could find
ourselves needing tactical nuclear
weapons to overcome numerical in-
feriority in some “conventional” battle.
So we will need to be. in a position to
get a bomb quickly.
Assuming we make a serious start
on developing the technology and on
acquiring a reactor, we can do this
either within or outside the Non-
Proliferation Treaty. The Australian
public is, however, far more likely to
be impressed by the urgency of obtain-
ing a nuclear option if the Government
rejects this treaty for the toothless
document it is and tells the Australian
people that while hoping for the best
we have to prepare for something worse.
If, anywhere, the needs of defence and
development coincide, it is in develop-
ing nuclear technology quickly. We
need to generate some sense of urgency
so people do not whinge at an extra
cent or so on cigarettes and beer.
A genuine test of
nationhood
COMMENT
BY
"OBSERVER"
ONE OF THE PRIVATE predictions
made about John Gorton when he first
became Prime Minister was that over
the first few months of office there
would not be much point in paying any
particular attention to what he would
say about foreign policy from one day
to the next. During his breaking-in
period he was likely to say anything. It
would be more to the point to consider
what he had to say after he had his trip
to Washington and his trip to South-
East Asia. The theory was that despite
his earlier experience in helping out
with some of the less-interesting side of
the work of the External Affairs Depart-
ment as assistant minister, he was some-
thing of a novice in foreign policy and
it might only be when he met the
leaders of other nations that he would
develop a real touch for it.
His trip to America is now finished.
His trip to South-East Asia is now
beginning. It seems likely that any week
now we might again have a declared
foreign policy and a declared military
policy.
In this interim period in which Mr.
Gorton has done so much thinking
aloud he must, one hopes, have begun
to learn the lesson that foreign policy is
best declared not in informal asides
but in set speeches, and that one of the
most important places to make them is
in the Australian Parliament. He was
quite right to treat his formal speech in
the White House as an important
occasion. But it seems odd that he had
not said some of it before in the Aus-
tralian Parliament, where it could be
debated and—most important—clarified.
A reasonable answer to such criticism,
of course, might be that Mr. Gorton
was not ready to be clear about what
he meant, that he was still having a
think. Where he is more clearly open
to criticism is in his announcement last
week to the Australian people that he
would like to see Australia acquire an
Israeli-type army. This is an extremely

interesting piece of news. But it seems
strange that it should have been con-
veyed to us not in a set speech made in
Australia to the Australian people but
in an off-the-cuff answer to a journalist
at the National Press Club in Washing-
ton.
Whether the fact that the Prime
Minister of Australia says he would like
to see Australia with an Israeli-type
army meant that we are going to have
one is another matter. It is quite
probable that this expression of wish
might prove to be of no particular
practical significance. The Prime
Minister’s trip to Washington may
already be convincing him of some-
thing he has previously been reluctant
to believe: that the Americans will
judge Australia by its actions, and that
the action that can impress them most
is an active relationship with Indonesia,
Singapore, and Malaysia. When Mr.
Gorton in his White House speech
warned the Americans that Australia
could pursue independent policies this
was what, in one sense, they wanted
to hear if it meant that Australia
would, off its own bat, take more
responsibilities in its own neighbor-
hood. It is not just for us to ask the
Americans about their future interest
in South-East Asia: it is even more to
the point for them to ask us about
ours, so that they can decide for them-
selves what kind of an associate we
really are.
It is hoped that on his present South-
East Asia tour Mr. Gorton will follow
up what he has learned in America
with an increased conviction that in
Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia it
is recognised that Australia can exist
in its own right, as an independent
nation sharing a neighborhood with
other independent nations, and a wel-
come friend, not thought of primarily
in terms of the racial origin of its
people but of its geographical position,
not thought of as too small to be of
any use, but as of comparatively great
economic strength, not thought of as an
American lackey, but respected all the
more because of its friendship with
America. Once again, as with the
Americans, it is only by our own
actions that these attitudes toward
Australia can be destroyed.
The first action by which we will be
judged in Indonesia, Singapore, and
Malaysia is the same action as that by
which we will be judged in America:
our attitude in this month’s five-power
defence talks in Kuala Lumpur.
Whether we like it or not, our readi-
ness to give military assistance to
Singapore and Malaysia has become
the critical test of our honesty and
seriousness of purpose in our own
neighborhood. It is a test not only for
the Singaporeans and Malaysians, but
for America and even, in a strange
way, for Indonesia as well. It is a
genuine test of nationhood. When we
know the answer to it, we shall know
better who we are.

AUSTRALIA
How did John Gorton go in America?
Breakfast in the White House last week ... Cyrus Vance, Lyndon Johnson, John Gorton, and Ambassador Sir Keith Waller (r.)
LAST THURSDAY morning in Can-
berra the word spread quickly. Army
Commander General Tom Daly had
arrived in his office at Russell Hill
wearing a black eye-patch in
recognition of the Prime Minister’s
American announcement that he
favored adopting an Israeli-style
defence system.
The jokes quickly multiplied and
became an inevitable prelude to con-
versations about Gorton’s American
visit. About the only point of general
agreement was that the Gorton
Government is not dull.
Most Government parliamentarians
seemed to think that Mr. Gorton had
done “all right” in America. There were
some 'mildly critical remarks about his
labored speech-making, but a feeling
that his powerful personality came
through well. All applauded the
departure from the sycophantic ’tone
which has marked many previous such
meetings and liked his firmness in
stressing the importance of ANZUS.
Labor Members picked on little
aspects of the Prime Minister’s per-
formance. “He can’t finish a sentence,”
said one. “He can’t make a speech
without telling his audience what a
small, insignificant country we are,”
said another.
The only point on which he was
almost universally criticised was his
reference to an Israeli-style army.
Some tried to read something of value
into it. Leading backbencher Edward
St. John said: “If he 'means we take
defence seriously as the Israelis do, then
that’s fine. ”
But most reacted more apprehen-
sively. From the Defence Ministries
the reaction was puzzlement (was he
serious?) and grumbling (does he
have to put us on the spot by making
these announcements overseas?). One
thing at least became clear: Mr. Gor-
ton’s statement was not a revelation
of some existing plan or submission;
it was a piece of attitudinising, a
quickly seized-on phrase. But DLP
leader Vince Gair was very scathing:
“The man is staggering around in the
dark.”
Gair was expressing rather brutally
what many Liberals were reading into
Mr. Gorton’s Israel analogy. One
recalled a speech he had made soon
after he was elected Leader. In
this speech he said: “We want defence
sufficient in the future to take the
first shock of any attack that might
ever be made on us until such time as
the .allies whom we have supported and
helped could come to our help.” Did
this mean that Mr. Gorton thought that
we needed to view defence as a man-
ning of the beaches against an invader
coming Gallipoli-style from landing-
craft or floating down on parachutes?
Was it shades of continental defence
and fortress Australia?
“I reacted with horror,” said one
of Mr. Whitlam’s aides. “He is making
the armed neutralists on our extreme
left respectable. Are we to expect the
announcement that Monash’s Max
Teichman has been appointed Defence
consultant to the PM’s Department?”
Australian defence is, of course,
usually seen in terms of helping friendly
countries resist subversion and aggres-
sion from elements likely to be hostile
to Australia. In theory, anyway, it is
a sustained application of carefully
mixed doses of military and economic
assistance, so that these countries can
defend themselves and indirectly defend
Australia into the bargain.
Informed opinion in Canberra was
that only in the event of South-East
Asia actually being lost to hostile
regimes would the Israeli army model
became relevant. In the meantime Ex-
ternal Affairs officers shuddered at the
Press Australia might be getting in
Indonesia and Malaysia. What were our
Muslim neighbors thinking about the
allusion to “spearheads” to be used out-
side Australia and the Prime Minister’s
failure to refute his questioner’s refer-
ence to Australia launching Israeli-style
“punitive forays to discourage aggres-
sion”?
They were all somewhat reassured by
the clarification issued by Mr. Gorton’s
Press secretary to a Sydney afternoon
newspaper in which he said Mr. Gor-
ton viewed the Israeli posture as “the
very worst alternative facing Australia.”
He meant presumably that the Prime
Minister saw it as a last option. We
are not after all surrounded by “Arabs”
yet, and the whole force of our defence
policy has been directed at helping pre-
vent our region being turned into a
hostile environment. In opposition to
the feelings of some of Mr. Gorton’s
most ignorant unofficial advisers,
South-East Asia did not yet seem a
write-off. A firm “no” to the write-off
idea was given wherever it was asked
in Canberra.
A series of Cabinet meetings held
before Mr. Gorton’s departure had
worked out what the Australian line
should be at the Kuala Lumpur talks
next week on the future of Malayasian-
Singapore defence. It was a compromise
to be sure, but at least it was some-
thing firm to offer.
The essence of “forward defence” is
to be maintained. Technical assistance
and training of Malaysian and Singa-
porean troops may be slightly enlarged.
The present army battalion may be “de-
garrisoned” when or even before the
British leave. The base at Terendak
with its luxurious appurtenances of
swimming-pools, hospitals, schools, and
married quarters will probably be dis-


pensed with. Wives and children will
be sent home to Australia.
But as long as the Malaysians and
Singaporeans want Australia to main-
tain the essence of a military presence
it will do that. So the battalion will
remain, though abandoning its garrison
facilities. It will “go bush,” operating
full time in training exercises and joint
operations. Battalions, rather than stay-
ing a year, may be rotated more rapidly,
serving perhaps six months only.
No grand new treaty will be enacted.
The Australian Government is deter-
mined to avoid a deep or specific com-
mitment to Malaysian defence. A treaty
would almost inevitably imply this.
This is the brief that Mr. Fairhall
and Mr. Hasluck carry to Kuala
Lumpur next week, and Mr. Gorton’s
Washington visit has no bearing on it.
A widely held view among officials
was that the Prime Minister’s trip had
been greatly overplayed. Excessively
large expectations had been created:
“Damned humiliating for it to be said
he was going to meet the presidential
candidates, and then for all but two to
fail to turn up,” said one. “He’s a new
leader of a significant ally and the
Americans just wanted to have a look
over him. He did a good job for the
administration and for Australia simply
by joining the procession of other
leaders from 'South-East Asia going to
the U.S. and saying they shouldn’t
abandon us.” “You shouldn’t always
expect the Prime Minister to bring back
a trophy. It is good for him to go over
and study the game” was another
answer to the question of what he had
achieved.
Many people in Canberra pondered
Mr. Gorton’s attitudes. He is revealing
himself as an intense sceptic. Although
over the years he has loudly and loyally
spoken on the Menzies and Holt lines on
forward defence and the importance of
the Vietnam War, it appears now,
according to associates, that he did it
without much conviction. He is unwill-
ing now, as Leader, to accept unques-
tioningly the assumptions on which
Government policy was based. Shaken
also by the TET offensive in Vietnam
and President Johnson’s standing down,
he became deeply pessimistic about the
future of South-East Asia and of the
possibility for America to maintain any
role there. Thus his reluctance to help
Malaysia, his allusions to fortress Aus-
tralia, and his renewed emphasis on
ANZUS.
In America and on his Asian visit,
his associates hope and expect he will
get some reassurance and return to Aus-
tralia less bleakly pessimistic about the
future of the region in which we live.
He may even, they say, become some-
thing of the Asian that Mr. Holt
became.
“It’ll make a lot of difference for
him to see things for himself and speak
to some of the people involved,” said
one senior departmental man. “He’s a
sceptic and he doesn’t believe most of
the reports we write. He has to nose
around himself and check things out.”
National Service
Leslie Bury's long climb-down
AT EIGHT MINUTES past five last
Wednesday Mr. Leslie Bury rose in the
Parliament and declared: “I oppose this
clause.” He was referring to a clause in
an amendment to the National Service
Act, drafted by the Government. It was
the last step in a long climb down.
Mr. Bury was dropping the clause
requiring universities to provide his
Department with the names, addresses,
and birthdates of all their male students
for purposes of catching draft-dodgers.
Enlivened by the case of Simon
Townsend the half-hourly-wakened
conscript in Holsworthy the Govern-
ment’s attempts to amend the National
Service legislation were a rather
humiliating exercise. The trouble for
the Government started when they
failed to notice the potentially explosive
nature of several administrative clauses.
The Cabinet looked at the amending
Bill but it was told by National Service
Minister Bury that the only proposals
of significance included in it were two
uncontentious provisions: a clause
enabling the Minister to grant indefinite
exemptions as a matter of discretion,
and the transfer of unwilling conscripts
from military to civil jails; as for the
many remaining clauses they were sup-
posed to be merely administrative
changes designed to close off loopholes.
So the Cabinet never looked closely
at the Bill. The Prime Minister’s
Department, understaffed and not poli-
tically astute in some areas, also simply
overlooked the “mere administrative
changes” which were to blow up into
a major row. The second error by the
Government turned out to be its
failure to consider the possible reaction
of the DLP, which immediately seized
on the so-called “pimping” sections of
the Bill and said it would use its
balance of power in the Senate to block
them. The Government hurriedly
agreed to withdraw them.
Then last weekend it became
apparent that another section of the Bill
would have to be dropped. This was
the one requiring universities to supply
information and open their records to
the Department. Widespread university
protest had been aroused. Several
University Councils had condemned the
legislation and some had said they
would refuse to obey it. Students
threatened to make it unworkable by
propagandising students to refuse to
answer questions about their birthdate.
Ministers and senior officials were
impressed by the fact that even very
conservative Vice-Chancellors spoke out
strongly against it. They also had in
the back of their minds the anarchy
which angry students in the U.S. and
Western Europe have wrought. So they
began looking for a way out.
First the DLP was contacted and
asked by the Government to defeat the
clause in the Senate. It refused.
Together with a minority of Ministers
and a number of backbench Liberals, it
believed the universities should not get
special treatment and that the Govern-
ment should not give in to this sort
of pressure.
Mr. Bury himself was said to be most
reluctant in moving the deletion.
Indeed, he went out of his way to make
the point: “I presume there would be
no desire on the part of universities to
win themselves the reputation of being
harborers of draft-dodgers and I expect
they will co-operate.”
The Government’s decision to drop
the most contentious clauses of the Bill
at least took much of the barb out of
the Opposition’s attack. Much of the
Opposition ammunition had been pre-
pared for the very amendments that the
Government deleted, and many Labor
speakers were obviously using material
that had been prepared for matters
which were no longer in the legislation.
The debate itself attracted little
public interest. The galleries were
rarely more than quarter-full through-
out the committee stages of the Bill—
although 20 fresh-faced young men in
Army uniform sat benevolently watch-
ing over the opening of the committee
debate.
Former Opposition Leader Arthur
Calwell took advantage of the legisla-
Hughes. ..

tion to make what some observers
believed to be a veiled attack on his
successor. The old warrior said he
would oppose conscription “until I
die.” He added that the Labor Party
was paying a “heavy price” for its con-
tinued opposition to the “filthy, bloody
war.” But this, he said, was a price
worth paying. “We must continue to
uphold our principles and fight and
lose, if necessary, rather than become a
Party of warmongers,” he said. “In the
long term we will be vindicated.” Yet
some of his followers seemed a little
dismayed at his next suggestion that
“it may take another two or three
elections before we again became a
Government but what does that
matter if the price we have to pay for
office is abandonment of our opposition
to the Vietnam War?”
On the whole, however, the debate
sparked off little fire and only a few
histrionics. Even House Leader Billy
Snedden’s persistent gagging of the
debate on each clause raised little
protest from the other side. The Oppo-
sition forced 18 divisions many on
the gag alone in the two days of
committee discussion on the Bill. But
the debate itself provided little that was
new. In general each side had the same
old speakers saying the same old
things. The Opposition were “defenders
of shirkers” . . . The Government was
comprised of “jingoists” and “Fascists.”
Queen’s Counsel Tom Hughes claimed
one Opposition amendment, extending
conscientious objection to include
opposition to a particular war, would
create objection on “purely political
grounds.” This, he said, would render
the National Service scheme a farce.
Sometime Government rebel Harry
Turner told the House the majority of
conscientious objectors were “either
cowards or spivs” who persuaded them-
selves they were heroes. The Opposi-
tion’s Gordon Bryant said Government
members had shown their “incipient
Fascism” shining through.
Strangely, the Government’s decision
to drop clause 22 sparked off one of
the fieriest speeches of the entire
debate. The clause required universities
and other institutions to reveal names,
addresses, ages, etc., of students and
former students. Labor’s Western Aus-
tralian Kim Beazley, who recently
received an MA for a thesis on the
role of Caucus in the Labor Party,
launched into a bitter denunciation of
the drafters of the clauses. He pointed
out, despite the Government’s sudden
decision to drop this provision, that
Australia had been relatively free of
student violence. “Yet the Government
produces the one thing by which a
violent minority of a university could
get the whole student body on its side.”
An interesting incidental point to
come out of the debate was the strength
of feeling among Government Members
that conscription was the best system
of defence recruitment. It showed first
when Mr. Harry Turner declared:
“Never again, so far as I am con-
cerned, will this country depend on
volunteers again. We sent overseas
(during the last war) men who were
over age, men who were medically
unfit, and men who had family
responsibilities, so that others who were
medically fit and young and had no
responsibilities might stay at home.
Never, never, never again.” He won
wide applause for these sentiments.
Someone's thinking of the "consumers"
WHEN THE Bring-Back-Utzon cam-
paign finally died with the return of
the Askin Government in February and
when protests about removing opera
from the main hall eventually ended,
the Sydney Opera House faded out of
the headlines. The only question the
public still seems to worry about is how
much it is really going to cost. But there
are still plenty of decisions yet to be
made; decisions that will vitally affect
the working of Sydney’s land-bound
version of the Fill.
Such questions as what sort of stage
machinery should be in the opera hall
are still to be decided, with the Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust (and, no doubt,
the design architect, Mr. Peter Hall, and
his associates) keen to get rid of the
revolving stage arrangement that was
originally intended there, and to replace
it with a system of lifts. Apart from
allowing more space for the orchestra
pit, which at present accommodates the
impossibly small number of 35
musicians, removing the revolve and
installing lifts would allow the Eliza-
bethan Opera Company to use the same
sets and stage system as it will have
in the new Melbourne cultural centre.
There is also the question of what
sort of organ should be installed, what
the interior decoration should be like.
So it goes on.
The public’s massive lack of know-
ledge of and interest in these matters
is not universal. A group of Sydney
people, ranging from past antagonists
in the Utzon battle to a Liberal MLA,
a QC, and some theatricals, have been
gathered together by puppeteer Mr.
Peter Scriven into the Sydney Opera
House Society. The society, which “does
not propose to involve itself in con-
troversies of the past” (in other words,
it is not a Bring-Back-Utzon body), aims
at “encouraging the completion of the
Opera House to the highest standard as
a work of architecture and to support
efforts designed to ensure the best use
of the building as a centre for the per-
forming arts.”
So far, most of the important partici-
pants in the Opera House drama seem
to be in favor of the new society; the
Minister for Public Works, Mr. Davis
Hughes, has had some friendly chats
with Scriven and the acting-chairman,
Mr. Gordon Samuels, QC, and Mr.
Peter Hall has given them a rundown
at the Opera House site on just how
things are going, and is keen about the
idea of such a body.
In addition to Samuels and Scriven,
members of the society’s acting com-
mittee are Elias Duek-Cohen and
Michael Baume (both of whom have
written books that disagree wildly about
the Opera House), Peter Coleman,
MLA, Mrs. Jean Stuart and Mrs. Joan
Winchester, and Dr. Neville Yeomans.
The society intends to “encourage
research and discussion on the Opera
House.” It will “sponsor or produce
publications, organise seminars, and
hold exhibitions, and it will endeavor
to disseminate information as widely as
possible to keep people informed on the
progress of the building and the plans
for its use.”
But will the new society succeed in
presenting a consumers’ view of the
Opera House to the Government when
the Opera House Trust, an officially
appointed body, has so clearly failed
to do the same thing? Committee mem-
bers seem confident that the Govern-
ment recognises the vacuum left by the
discrediting of the Opera House Trust,
but at present there is no body which
can inform the minister or the archi-
tects of “consumer” wishes.
The society will hold a lunch-hour
public meeting to launch itself on Wed-
nesday, July 17, and plans to raise
funds by putting on a benefit night the
following Sunday.


South Australia
Millicent showdown
WHEN THE South Australian Court
of Disputed Returns delivered its judg-
ment and declared the Millicent
election void, only the president, Mr.
Justice Walters, seemed entirely satis-
fied and judicially composed. On his
right, the Minister of Lands, Mr. David
Brookman, certainly wasn’t, for he
dissented. To the left, Opposition
Leader Dunstan sat brooding and calcu-
Premier Hall ...' endorsement?
lating. Perhaps he was considering the
prospect of an exhausting Millicent by-
election. The other members, the
Attorney-General, Mr. Robin Millhouse,
and the ALP Member for Whyalla, Mr.
Ronald Loveday, simply stared coldly
ahead.
Shortly afterwards Premier Hall
announced that electoral reform is to
be the main election issue. If the LCL
wins Millicent, he said, he will consider
it “an endorsement of our electoral
plan,” whereas if the ALP retains the
seat he felt he would be bound to “work
out a compromise.” By gaining Mil-
licent, Mr. Hall would achieve the
necessary constitutional majority to
change the State’s electoral boundaries,
and with his plan for 25 city seats and
20 country seats it is estimated that
the LCL would need to receive less
than forty percent of the State vote to
lose power. The by-election campaigns
for both Parties thus promise to be
intensive and bitter.
The Millicent electorate is situated
in the south-east of South Australia, its
ragged boundary running from the
Coorong to the Victorian border. Some
7700 voters are on the roll at present,
and they range in occupation from cray-
fishermen at the old port of Robe and
sawmillers at the forest town of Penola
to affluent farmers working some of the
State’s richest, most productive soil.
Millicent has been regarded as a safe
Labor seat since it was first split off
under Thomas Playford in 1965 from
the old electorate of Victoria.
In 1956 the ALP polled a 52 percent
vote, building this up to 61.8 in 1965,
before dropping back to the fifty-fifty
situation of March this year. Even
before the Court had delivered its judg-
ment, and with nothing to lose, Labor
Members and Party hacks had com-
menced campaigning in Millicent,
strengthening what was for March a
poor local organisation. Not to be out-
done, the LCL retaliated by setting up
a Party office in the town, and then its
own canvassers began to arrive. Over
the next two weeks the electorate will
receive a quite remarkable amount of
attention, since Don Dunstan believes
it will, in effect, be voting whether or
not Labor or any Opposition Party is
to govern in South Australia before the
end of the century.
So far the new South Australian
Government has sat only long enough
to defeat the Dunstan Government. It
will sit again shortly after the new
Millicent result is known. With the
possibility of a Millicent by-election in
mind, Mr. Hall’s Government has been
clearly marking time. Its decisions have
so far been routinely administrative,
with the exception of a proposed
rationalisation of the State railway
system. This was a popular decision
generally, and even though Millicent is
to lose some rail services it is not
expected to influence voting. Mr. Hall’s
Cabinet is an unassuming one. The
somewhat naive appointment of Mr.
Murray Hill as Minister of Town Plan-
ning caused considerable city criticism.
Mr. Hill was not only a leading critic
of town planping legislation in the last
Parliament but also recently was the
registered manager of a large Murray
Hill land-development firm. Still, this
is not an issue likely to influence the
voters of Millicent, who in the deep
south-east of South Australia have been
given the signal honor of deciding the
State’s political future.
The West
Superoptimists
THERE WAS NO holding the opti-
mists at an Institution of Engineers’
symposium in Perth last week. With
their attention focused on the Pilbara-
Ashburton area, a great slab of land
stretching about 200 miles around the
western “shoulder” of Australia, from
North-West Cape to Derby, they saw its
annual minerals production rising from
the current $66.8 million to $250-300
million by 1975, and its population ris-
ing swiftly from almost nil to a quarter
million by 1985.
Of all minerals development outlined,
perhaps the most significant was spelt
out by Hamersley Iron’s managing
director, Mr. Russel T. Madigan, who
explained the rationale of metallising.
“The significant aspect is the possibility
of gaining access to a new market area,”
he said. “It is not commonly realised
that the highly developed countries
such as Europe and North America
produce nearly half of their steel from
scrap. It has been shown that metallised
materials can increase the production
of electric furnaces by as much as 40-50
percent, and because of their low
residual element content such materials
are likely to find wide application as a
scrap supplement.” Mr. Madigan re-
peated the claim often made by Indus-
trial Development Minister Mr. Charles
Court when he said: “Metallised
agglomerates could prove to be of
greater importance to the development
of this country than the development
of another steel industry.”
Mr. Court, whose visions for the
area are at last being caught up with
by others, has had to upgrade his esti-
mates of the population build-up in the
Ashburton-Pilbara region from 100,000
people by 1985 to 250,000 people by
that time. He said, “I know I’m a
born optimist, but even my most un-
kind critics would have to admit that
all estimates made in 1962 have been
surpassed.”
An authority on the area, with a
more academic approach to the multi-
plier effect, economist Dr. Alex Kerr
pointed out that on available data
export income from the Ashburton-
Pilbara region was likely to reach $4OO
million by the mid-1970s and $6OO mil-
lion by the early 1980 s.
Another optimist was Mr. John
Knox, head of the West’s new trans-
port co-ordination set-up, who advo-
cated an advanced container-type
barge scheme for the coastal shipping,
looked into sophisticated rail and air-
freight schemes, and put the provoca-
tive viewpoint on roads that: “I think
we might be nearing the stage where, in
certain places, we need two sorts of
roads—social roads and cargo roads or
carefully controlled dual-purpose roads.
I pose the question—‘Should not we
be carrying 150- to 200-ton payloads
at a time in road trains having 500 or
600 h.p. under their bonnet?’ and I
think they can probably succeed in re-
ducing the freight rate to something
like 2.5 cents per ton mile.”
Some of the few cautionary words
came from Professor Sir Philip Baxter,
chairman of the Atomic Energy Com-
mission, who doubted that the area
would support a nuclear power station
on present indications. Like Dr. Kerr,
he confessed himself hamstrung by
lack of information on the area, but
he forecast that the combined power
demand of the Pilbara coastal area
was unlikely to exceed 200mW in the
19705.
Mr. Court asked Sir Philip how the
position would be if consumers were
signed up to buy 400mW by 1975
and IOOOmW by 1980. That would be
a different matter, was the reply; on
that basis nuclear power would be justi-
fied. Well, said Mr. Court, that’s just
what we’re negotiating to do.

OVERSEAS
Gorton’s rating in
Malaysia and Singapore
From HARVEY STOCKWIN in Kuala Lumpur
MR. GORTON’S travelling across the
Pacific to be reassured (in the words of
the communique) of LBJ’s “keen in-
terest in the progress of the consulta-
tions and in the outcome of the forth-
coming Five Power Conference in Kuala
Lumpur” seemed, in Singapore and
Malaysia, a dubious advantage for Aus-
tralia when the Five Power Defence
Conference meets next week.
Not that the communique or the visit
got much play in the local Press. As
things stand Mr. Gorton’s main ally at
the moment would seem to be the
incredible capacity of the Malaysia-
Singapore newspapers to ignore what
it is in their countries’ self-interest to
know. Even the canvassing in Australia
of the possibility of abandoning “for-
ward defence” has not been reported. It
has been widely assumed .here that, in
Mr. Hasluck’s words, 1971 is a signifi-
cant date only for the British—so that
when an article by Denis Warner
attacking the Gortonian assumptions was
reprinted in the “Straits Times” readers
could be forgiven for wondering what
Denis Warner was attacking.
While the conference is too close for
any comment to be publicly made,
especially as Mr. Gorton is now on his
way, the impression one gets is that the
Malaysians and Singaporeans would
have preferred him to visit Asia before
Washington and would expect Australia
to pursue regional objectives of her own
without first getting reassurances from
abroad. At one extreme there would
seem no likelihood of Malaysia or Singa-
pore agreeing to a new defence system
of which the United States was a direct
underwriter. At the other end of the
scale they would not be too happy to
create a new system with an American
client State, which is the image that
Gorton is promoting of Australia.
In this context it would seem worth
restressing that the very fact that the
Five Power Conference will be discuss-
ing future arrangements, not just wind-
Ing-up old ones, shows the degree of
regional acceptance Australian diplo-
macy has already won. If the discussions
reveal a half-hearted Anzac interest this
acceptance will be in danger.
It also testifies to the fact that Aus-
tralia is psychologically accepted as a
regional power which has had a long-
standing presence in the region even
the Indonesian Foreign Minister’s words
have underlined this. To make it
abundantly clear, therefore, as Mr.
Gorton has done, that Australia is
only a small power, not only ignores
the facts and not only makes others
prematurely aware of weakness, but
also needlessly draws down the Austra-
lian balance in the power bank, since
power comes not only from what you
are and have, but from what you are
seen to be. For various reasons
Malaysia and Singapore would like their
connection with Americap power un-
emphasised and unstressed. As Lee
Mr. Gorton came back from America this week. Malaysia would
sooner have seen him first
Kuan Yew put it in an interview
recently: “We know that the Australians
and New Zealanders have hinged their
security with an American presence . . .
this is a fact of life, 'but I don’t need
the Americans on the land. I don’t
? van , t „ American troops or units on
land. To have stressed the American
presence mimed,ately prior to the Con-
ference, as Gorton has done, would
. , ■ A .
seem to have given Australia less room
for manoeuvre, not more, as claimed.
If the Anzao response is lukewarm in
Kuala Lumpur next week this will be
seen as a reflection of Washington’s
mood, too.
First and foremost beneath the mili-
tary minutiae of the Conference dis-
cussions, what Malaysia and Singapore
will be looking for are specific indica-
tions of Anzac political commitments.
Defence details are one thing —but the
point is where do the Anzac intention
and heart lie? Stressing as Mr. Gorton
has reportedly done in Washington that
“if the Americans go we go” indicates
not only a sterile approach (supposing
the Americans turned round and said
the same thing how would that help?),
but also one which fails to see the
political wood for the military trees. Put
another way, a strong assertion at this
stage of Australian independence and
capacity for independent decision would,
despite its risks, seem the best way of
safeguarding Australian independence.
There can be little doubt that the
Americans would prefer it that way, too.
In short, Mr. Gorton has not made his
first belated and truncated Asian visit
any easier for himself. At a time when
it seems fashionable to mark down one’s
country or one’s currency, he would
appear to have somewhat devalued
Australian credibility.

greatest friends of Australia, in Malaysia

taking Australian professions of regional
interest any more seriously than those
of the British. “What we would like to
establish,” said one Malaysian diplomat


to me a little while ago, “is a continu-
ing Commonwealth connection as one
of the central facts of our diplomacy.”
More recently, he commented, that
“Australia seems to be going through

Sling-shot killing
THE EYES are badly bloodshot, the
hands are raw and swollen, the hair is
matted and is now more grey than
golden in the past two or three days
Senator Robert Kennedy has come to
look like a man who knows that he has
lost, and has perhaps also the even
more agonising knowledge of realising
why.
California come or go, the real prize
his Party’s nomination for the
Presidency was almost certainly
taken beyond his grasp when the voters
of Oregon gave him the thumbs down
last week.
Why did Kennedy fail? His associ-
ates and aides undoubtedly would like
to believe and some of them are
already proclaiming that he was
beaten by the power of the Party estab-
lishment. It is not true.
One man alone was the agent of his
destruction the man whom Kennedy,
like everybody else, had consistently
underrated from the outset of this year’s
Presidential campaign.
Not content with toppling a
President, Eugene McCarthy has now
demolished a legend, that of Kennedy
invincibility. He has become the
giant-killer of American politics a
.candidate who set out six months ago
with a sling and five small stones and
already has two mammoth political
corpses at his feet. Most believe it
would need a miracle to give him his
chance to lay low a third, Vice-President
Hubert Humphrey.
It was the enduring nature and
power of McCarthy’s appeal that, above
anything else, wrecked the Kennedy
strategy. Try as he might with
McCarthy already in the field Bobby
Kennedy could never quite rise to the
challenging role that history initially
had seemed to cast for him. By missing
his own rendezvous with destiny last
autumn, he had allowed the part to be
pre-empted by another, and all the
Kennedy workers’ efforts to re-create a
Galahad-image for their own hero some-
how suggested nothing more than a
tawdry attempt to put on a road-show
production of “Camelot” (damagingly
complete with all the old cast of now-
bloated subsidiary players).
It is easy to see now why there was
a “lie-in-the-soul” of the Kennedy
campaign from the beginning. It was a
campaign that was supposed to draw its
strength from three basic emotive
forces courage, compassion, and
concern. But where was the courage last
November when McCarthy took to the
field, and Kennedy morose and
silent lingered on the touchlines?
Where was the compassion last Decern-
ber when the uproarious joke at the
Kennedy Christmas party at Hickory
Hill was that McCarthy’s campaign
was so incompetent that it looked as
if it must have been run by King Con-
stantine?
Where was the concern when, as late
as February, Kennedy could announce
in one breath that America’s whole
moral position in Vietnam had been
“badly undermined,” and in the next
McCarthy ... the
giant-killer
Bobby Kennedy...legend of
invincibility demolished
Humphrey ... the
one to beat
declare that he would not oppose
President Johnson’s renomination “in
any foreseeable circumstances”?
In the end those liabilities clearly
proved too much even for the most
magnetic name in America. The Ken-
nedy Presidential campaign was, in
fact, caught in a cleft stick. In order to
win, it had once the predictable
offer of the No. 2 spot on a Kennedy
ticket had been coldly refused in a
Wisconsin hotel bedroom somehow
to jostle McCarthy out of the race. But
every move aimed in that direction (and
in Oregon they were not so much
moves as hefty shoves) only served to
revive public memories of how the
rivalry began. For once the voters
decided that the nice guy should not
finish last.
For the Kennedy forces the defeat
though not at the very end totally
unexpected, except in its surprisingly
wide margin was almost overwhelm-
ing. It meant the end of an unbroken
streak of electoral success stretching
back over 22 years and 27 popular con-
tests. Even more immediately relevant, it
also meant the loss beyond any hope of
salvage of the basic strategy on which
this year s Kennedy campaign for the
t, . j , / Fjj a
Presidency has been founded. A
j., ; . i in
candidate who can collect only 42 per-
. r . • t a- ci
cent of the vote in Indiana, 51 percent
in Nebraska, and a losing 39 percent
in Oregon cannot expec? to present
himself to a convention as the demon-
strated and undisputed choice of the
people.
There is, however, ,one other thing
that the Democratic Party if it is to
win in November does now need
to become concerned about. Deservedly
or not, Senator Kennedy has become for
the deprived, the despairing, and the
dispossessed of American society the
one symbol of hope, the personal
promise of better times ahead. It is an
appeal that no other candidate,
Democratic or Republican, can match
not even Eugene McCarthy, who
(like Adlai Stevenson before him) now
finds his most fervent supporters not
just on the college campuses (whose
enthusiasm Kennedy has done nothing
to dent) but also in the middle-class
country clubs and on the smart
cocktail circuit, too.
For the first time in American
politics, at least in the internal power
struggle of a single Party, class lines
are now in danger of being rigorously
drawn. The “have-nots” are virtually all
for Kennedy, the “haves” are for the
most part divided between Humphrey
and McCarthy. It is certainly not a
question of policy: McCarthy can
plausibly claim to be easily the most
radical candidate the Democratic Party
has seen emerge since the days of Estes
Kefauver and his coonskin cap.
But McCarthy is pre-eminently a
teacher, while Kennedy is essentially a
redeemer a man who in the black
ghettoes and the Mexican townships it
j s obviously far more important to
touch than to listen to. Kennedy’s
power here is almost uncanny: for the
racially disadvantaged and the econ-
omically underprivileged he is the
prince who can do no wrong, the
saviour who was promised and has
come.
The intensity of emotional feeling
Kenned amon such voters make f
k diilicult to » ee how , he Demo .
cratic ' Party can retain iheir allegiance
in November if it disappoints their
expectations with its Convention
~ . . v . r> t i
choice in August. Yet no Party, least

, un u u , ,
era of the backlash, can be expected
x , , , , ’ , . r , ,
tO . km,ckle und f ,0 that kl " d .°*
™ nor, ‘y group threat - a threat that
Komedy himself has now, perhaps un-
wisely. be g un t 0 im P'y m hls own
speeches.
And that brings one to the final,


and perhaps decisive, reason for what
now looks uncommonly like the failure
of the long-prepared Kennedy bid to
reoccupy the White House. Personally
Senator Kennedy, with some lapses
(now perhaps understandably in-
creasing), has conducted an honest and
high-minded campaign on the issues,
and certainly no one could have be-
haved with more dignity and grace
than he did in defeat last week. But
there has nevertheless been something
about the whole thrust and drive of
the Kennedy effort that seems to have
alienated and alarmed large sections
of the nation.
Revealingly, from hotelkeepers to
telephone supervisors wherever the
Kennedy caravan has moved, the com-
plaint is always the same. “Those
people,” one is told, “march in as if
they owned not only the place but you
as well. They don’t ask or request,
they command and commandeer. I tell
you, it’s scary.”
It was, no doubt, that kind of per-
sonal reaction that the “New York
Times” had in mind when it delivered
its harsh judgment last week that
“Senator Kennedy and his entourage
have been too aggressive and too
relentless in their single-minded
pursuit of power.” And at any other
time given the unihibited nature of
American political combat—that might
have sounded a strange judgment. But
then this has been a very strange
political year.
The Republicans
Nixon strides out
ONCE AGAIN the identity of the
Republican opponent has been rendered
a degree more certain. With Oregon,
Mr. Richard Nixon fought his last
Primary election of the year and once
again did excellently with 73 percent of
the Republican vote. Governor Ronald
Reagan got 23 percent, too slight an
improvement over his 22 percent in
Nixon. .. looks in first-class shape
Nebraska to make any particular im-
pression, and this in spite of a costly
campaign (in which, to be sure, he
took no direct part personally). A tardy,
improvised campaign on behalf of Gov-
ernor Rockefeller for a write-in vote
did not save him from a miserable show-
ing, 4 percent.
Ever since Governor Romney with-
drew from the New Hampshire contest,
Mr. Nixon has had to live with the
lack of opponents competing openly and
directly with him. He has shown his
ability to bring in votes; the shadows of
doubt that linger in the Republican
Party concern his ability to defeat a
powerful opponent, should the Demo-
crats manage to put one up. The Repub-
lican convention will have to make its
choice at a time when the Democrat
choice, formally at least, is still unmade,
Each of Mr. Nixon’s successful Primary
campaigns has made the idea
(cherished by Mr. Reagan, in particu-
ar) a deadlocked convention,
forced to seek a new candidate, a shade
more far-fetched. The old candidate,
only one who has gone through the
mill of seeking popular approval, looks
first-class shape and the chance of
any other Republican displacing him
has become remote.
France
The franc, sick currency of Europe?
“IT IS QUITE simple. Either de
Gaulle shoots a few workers or he
devalues” was how one bloodthirsty
financier summed up the French situ-
ation last week. He has a horrid point.
In three short weeks France has been
stripped of its financial power. The
currency that for the past three years
or so has bullied its way through inter-
national financial conferences, has spat
on the dollar, is itself now naked. The
French Government has already offered
the workers a ten percent wage in-
crease more than enough to upset
France’s competitive position in world
markets. If it is forced to offer more to
get the workers working it will be
difficult to stave off devaluation in the
long-term.
On Friday, after the franc had
dropped below the floor imposed by the
rules of the International Monetary
Fund, the Banque De France reaffirmed
its determination to hold the parity.
Nonetheless the reimposition of ex-
change control regulations, lifted only
16 months ago, has meant the scrapping
of the General’s plans for Paris as
Europe’s financial centre.
At the close of last week, dealings in
French francs had stopped for all but
the smallest transactions. “Getting a
French bank on the telex is a devil of a
job,” said one London banker. Com-
mercial banks in many centres were
simply not prepared to risk holding
francs. The job of getting money out of
France had become a matter of suit-
cases rather than telegraphic transfers.
France certainly has more than
enough cash in the kitty to make
the old rate stick. It sits on the
world’s second largest pile of gold.
It also has foreign exchange worth $BOO
million, and can draw $9OO million from
the IMF any time it wishes.
Unlike Britain, however, France
has seldom dodged the logic of de-
valuation. Before the current crisis,
there were signs that the franc
was becoming overvalued, particularly
Prime Minister Pompidou (r.) after last
week’s Cabinet reshuffle
in relation to the Deutschmark and
Italian lira. Even if the current strikes
are settled quickly, the Prime Minister,
M. Pompidou, remains committed to
meet the unions in the autumn to
discuss the increases already offered
in the light of subsequent movements
in the cost of living.
Not that a devaluation of the franc
would necessarily spell disaster for the
world currency system. Indeed it is
arguable that nothing but good might
flow from the franc’s present plight.
Certainly if France now has to start
shelling out some of those ill-gotten
reserves to meet payments deficits, the
problem of the effect on world trade
of reducing America’s deficit will be
greatly eased.
A French devaluation would make
Britain’s task only marginally more
difficult. It is not that important a
trading partner. However, if one
Common Market rate is to change
it is possible that the other members
may also take the opportunity for
adjustment. In particular the Deutsch-


mark and possibly the lira might be
upvalued at the same time. In which
case Britain could end up better off.
There is nothing immutable about
the value of a currency, and the
Common Market’s fixed unit of account
was bound to have to face this problem
eventually. The formula is for consul-
tation before devaluation, followed by
the suspension of all current and
capital transactions. Then the Council
of Ministers must meet within three
days to either change the value of the
unit of account or to renegotiate those
elements in the agricultural agreement
affected by the devaluation.
Stripped of its power the franc will
not be so keen to see the downfall of
the dollar. Before the crisis, had the
two-tier-gold-price system collapsed,
the course of events was fairly predict-
able. America would certainly have
demonetised gold, by breaking the link
with the dollar, rather than have raised
its price. Britain would have linked the
pound to the dollar. De Gaulle would
haye whipped Europe into line, and
created a new gold bloc with the
European currencies tied to gold. The
dollar and pound would then have
floated downward in relation to the
European currencies. This would not
have been in France’s best interests, but
the chance of humbling the Anglo-
Saxons would have been well worth the
price.
Now, even if it had the power to
create a gold bloc, France could no
longer afford to. Its weakened franc
could not face a decline in the value of
the dollar and the pound. And, if
Europe were also forced to leave gold,
the price really would drop below $35
an ounce, slicing a lump from France’s
precious gold reserve. Ironically, France
now has an interest in seeing the
present monetary system preserved,
since its collapse would be more likely
to end in financial chaos rather than
a return to the “majesty of gold.” And,
if the franc is to be the sick currency
of Europe, there is a chance that
France will abandon its opposition to
the Special Drawing Rights scheme of
the IMF.
The trouble is that, although France
now has a stake in monetary co-opera-
tion rather than disruption, it may be
too late. Everything turns on what hap-
pens in the gold market. So far this has
been the one bright spot in the whole
mess. The price of gold on the free
market is now just over $42 an ounce.
In the turmoil one might have expected
heavy buying to push the rate higher.
Says one central banker: “I expected it
to go roaring through $42 days ago,
but I’m pleased it hasn’t.”
The higher the free-market price goes
compared to the official price of $35
an ounce the less tenable is the two-tier
system. Its collapse at this moment in
time would probably see a bear garden
of floating exchange rates, to the total
confusion of international traders and
to the detriment of world trade.
In the meantime it is the British
pound that suffers. When Britain de-
valued de Gaulle sneered, when the
franc totters the pound totters, too. It
looks thoroughly unfair. But again
Britain is paying the price of being a
reserve currency and collecting the back-
wash from all those years of payments
deficits.
Fleet Street
King deposed
SO Mr. Cecil King has gone the same
way that he came in by a board-
room putsch. Seventeen years ago it
was Mr. King who did the putsching,
and he became chairman of the Inter-
national Publishing Corporation, which
owns, among many other things, the
country’s largest-selling daily paper -—-
the “Daily Mirror” and its weaker
brother, the “Sun.” Last Thursday
morning, while he was shaving, Mr.
King received a letter from the com-
pany secretary telling him it was the
wish of all his colleagues on the board
that he should resign. Mr. King said
certainly not: “It will look as if I have
been caught with my hand in the till.”
So in the afternoon he was sacked.
Denied the front page of the “Daily
Mirror” for practically the first time in
his working life, Mr. King, who is 67,
took to the box. He went first to Inde-
pendent Television News. Yes, he said,
it had come as a great surprise. But
Fleet Street is not like an old-fashioned
minuet, it’s a bit of a jungle.
Why had he been sacked? “It was a
counter-attack by the Labor Party mem-
bers of the board on what I had said
on the front page of the ‘Daily Mirror’
a - fortnight ago.” Mr. King’s signed
front-page article on the morning of the
Labor Party’s savage defeats in the
municipal election called for the sack-
ing of Prime Minister Harold Wilson.
It also said that Britain faced the great-
est financial crisis in its history, which
would not be removed by “lies about
our reserves.” Foreign holders of sterl-
ing, who took Mr. King’s position as a
part-time director of the Bank of Eng-
land seriously, pushed the pound down,
and Mr. King revealed that he had
resigned from the bank the previous day.
This attack on Mr. Wilson predictably
backfired. Instead of weakening Mr.
Wilson’s wobbly position, it strengthened
it. Even Labor MPs who desperately
want Mr. Wilson to go cursed rather
than cheered Mr. King; if they did not
want to be taken for a Press proprietor’s
puppet they had to shut up, and they
did.
It was thought curious at the time
that the “Mirror” article was signed by
the chairman and not run as an edi-
torial. Fleet Street gossip had it that
Mr. Hugh Cudlipp who, now at the
age of 54, succeeds Mr. King as chair-
man of IPC was opposed to its pub-
lication. Be that as it may, what is true
is that after its publication Mr. Cudlipp
met Mr. Wilson and remained on
friendly terms with other members of
the Government, including the Chancel-
lor of the Exchequer.
Although he will claim (truthfully)
that he had no hand in Mr, King’s
downfall, it will be unlike Mr. Wilson
if he does not draw the attention of
colleagues who might have similar pre-
tensions to the awfulness of the warning.
But Mr. Wilson was certainly lucky in
that Mr. King’s attack was launched
from a crumbling managerial position.
Some IPC managers have long been
unhappy about the regime.
But, surprised and shaken as he was
on Thursday, Mr. King was also unre-
pentant. He supposed that the “Daily
Mirror” “is going to support the Labor
Party just in time to nail its flag to the
mast as the ship goes down.” He might
turn out to be right about that, at least.
He also said that IPC’s preliminary
figures, which were about to be pub-
lished, were going to be unsatisfactory.
But that is not exactly a surprise, either.
Cecil King...a boardroom putsch and out the way he came in


LOVE,
1968
IF YOU THINK that Love, 1968, is
no different from Love, 1967, or Love,
1958, or, indeed, Love, 1968 BC, ex-
cept in the mind of a diligent feature-
writer, look at three things which have
happened so far this year:
• Last month it was announced 'in
New York that a chemical contracep-
tive which with one subcutaneous
application can render a woman infer-
tile all her life if she wishes is in the
testing stage. If you think you have
clear ideas on the long-term conse-
quences of the present contraceptive
pill, then consider the effects of a
one-shot, lifelong contraceptive on
women, and, more particularly, on
men.
• Researchers reported last month
that a man who had received a
woman’s kidney in transplant wasn’t
at all happy about it; his body didn’t
reject it but his mind did. Transplant
surgery in 1968 is attracting the same
vivid interest which oral contraception
has" in the past few years and it raises
even more complicated questions. The
man with the woman’s kidney is being
ridiculous and illogical, of course. Even
South Africa could put a black heart
into a white body, but transplant sur-
gery as it grows more common must
break down the common man’s ideas
of the differences between races and
sexes (even if he is no Alf Garnett)
and is going to make it much more
difficult for men and women to main-
tain their traditional fictions about each
other.
• The Australian Customs Department
released the “Kama Sutra.” This will
have no effect on anyone. Our dili-
gent censors might consider that
science and surgery can and do make
far greater changes in our attitudes to
sex than the bpoks and films which
they keep away from us so carefully
and there is nothing any Government
official can do about it.
It is clear then that a great deal is
happening which is changing attitudes
to love and sex. It is not possible to
measure these effects on societies or on
individuals, although the poet and the
novelist may try, in the way in which
we can measure the effects of, say, the
discovery of oil or nickel on the gross
national product, but it is a good deal
more fun to try.
These are some of the changing
aspects of love:
THE MYSTERY OF LOVE
DESPITE THE IMAGES of the TV
commercial, mother-love is not a clean
shirt nor is love the same as desire.
Commercialism wades ceaselessly
through the areas of love and there is
no more rewarding area for its activi-
ties than the so-called feminine
mystique. Woman’s essential mystery
almost has become taken over by an
industry calculated to encourage
women to make themselves more
desirable to men, with a hazy sort of
love suggested as a reward for all the
trouble.
Some of the techniques would seem
to defeat the purpose. Most of the
bizarre products of fashion designers
begin by alienating the men they aim
to attract by the very nature of their
aggressive difference; feminine artifices
and allures which once were kept dis-
creetly away from masculine attention
are now advertised with such bluntness
that any man not aware of the padded
virtues of the latest brassiere or the
enticements of the newest pantie-girdle
must either be blind or just not
interested in women.
Yet with most of her commercial
“mysteries” exposed to the world (not
to mention her breasts) woman still
mystifies man. Helped, no doubt, by
commercialism, the male unthinkingly
equates female mystery with desire
and never more so in the 20th cen-
tury since the introduction of the mini-
skirt. Nothing seemed more designed
to react against a woman’s physical
desirability. Men had become con-
ditioned to the bikini, but were not
prepared for a wholesale display of
stocking, tops on legs which often were
better displayed in bedrooms.
The mini-skirt went through an un-
easy period of adjustment around a
woman’s waist, then, suddenly, rested
there comfortably, temptingly. By
exposing an extra four or more inches
of their flesh, women have enhanced
their mystery.
Writing on love in “Aspects of a
Single Theme,” the Spanish philosopher
Jose Ortega y Gasset said: “One could
say that the purpose of the luxury
and elegance, adornment and jewellery
which a lady places between herself
and others is to conceal her inner self,
to make it more mysterious, remote,
and inaccessible . . . Nothing is more
needed, the better to clarify the work-
ings of love, than to define with some
exactness the role which sexual instinct
plays in them. If it is an absurdity
to say that a man’s or a woman’s true
love for one another has nothing sexual
about it, it is another absurdity to
believe that love can be equated with
sexuality . . . Love, in its very
essence, is choice. And since it springs
from the personal core the spiritual
depths the selective principles which
determine it are, at the same time,
the most intimate and mysterious
preferences which form our individual
character.”
In 1968 our principles of selectivity
in love remain as much of a mystery
to ourselves as to another people. What
we do know is that Mary Quant and
the whole industry around her have
made it a much more desirable mys-
tery.
THE COURTSHIPS OF LOVE
IN AUSTRALIA the matter of who
married whom is often decided by
questions of what suburb you live in,
or what your transport habits are. For
those who use public transport, this in
itself can be part of the lottery of love.
Being next to a person of the opposite
sex in a bus or train for up to an
hour a day can itself sometimes settle
matters. And it costs less than dating,
although the costs of dates are now
being increasingly overcome by that
effective form of female emancipation,
the dutch shout. When greater free-
dom is required, there is the prime
vehicle of courtship, Dad’s car.
Boys and girls no longer carry out
many of the traditional ceremonies of
courtship. A catching game might
be a better name than courtship. (Per-
haps it was always so.) The sense
of “deeper relationship” is not marked
by public declarations. It just grows.
Out of the feeling that all other possi-
bilities have been eliminated comes the
proposal. Perhaps this greater sense of


informality, along with affluence, is
the reason why marriages are getting
younger than they used to be.
In economic terms, getting married
is now somewhat less of a gamble. The
young wife works on for a while, so
that some of that saving that used to
precede a marriage can now be de-
ferred until after marriage itself. And,
at least in theory, greater credence is
given to the possibility that by being
married partners have not necessarily
given up their claim to separate iden-
tity. Whether there is a real change
or a verbal one is undiscoverable, but
at least there are more words that say
it is so.
However, the outward ceremonies of
betrothal and marriage seem just as
entrenched as ever, perhaps because
just about everyone can now afford
them. There has never before been
such a complicated series of parties be-
tween engagement and wedding day as
now occurs in the suburbs, usually
accompanied by the piling up of con-
sumer durables, and never before has
there been such universal ability to
purchase all the accoutrements of a
traditional wedding—to such an extent
that it can now be smart to get married
in a fashion so modest that it was once
the prerogative of the very poor.
THE ECONOMICS OF LOVE
THIRTY YEARS AGO a Mother’s
Day gift was a bunch of white chry-
santhemums, home-grown by those
with enough foresight, and a card with
a sickly verse on it. Father’s Day did
not exist, and gifts at Christmas and
birthdays, children excepted, were dis-
tinguished more for the spirit than the
expense. These days, the cost of expres-
sing appropriate love on the right day
is staggeringly high. High points for
retail sales are Christmas and Mother’s
Day, and some industries depend
almost entirely on these two celebra-
tions.
It has been suggested, for example,
that electric shavers exist mainly as
gifts from women to men, who go right
on using the gear they had before.
There is even a mildly funny television
commercial built around this situation.
The price of parental love is easy
enough to estimate: the toy industry,
with a $4O-million-a-year turnover, is
built on that. It is harder to work
out how much men and women spent
on each other through courtship and
marriage.
A large part of the multi-million-
dollar entertainment industry aims at
catering for people in love. Restaurants,
theatres, motels all get their cut out
of the pursuit of love, and they need
to get in and get their share as quickly
as possible. Certainly, young men can
better afford to take their girlfriends
out before they are married than after.
Figures on jewellery and watches
suggest that about $4O million a year
(almost $4 a head) is spent in Aus-
tralia in this field. The bulk of this
would clearly be gifts. Other luxury
items, such as fur coats and perfumes,
could not survive on their present
scale without love. And if women
persist in giving men ties they won’t
wear and electric-shavers they don’t
use, then men retaliate with slippers
too fragile for everyday wear, stationery
that never gets used, and endless
wrong perfumes and cosmetics.
But what seems an interesting
development is that as expensive gift-
giving has become more prevalent it
has also become more practical. One
of Sydney’s large shops reports that
birthdays and other days of celebration
are becoming more and more the
opportunity for giving things which
are accepted as essentials and which
would be bought at some time, anyway.
For Mother’s Day this year, the shop
reported, their sales doubled for elec-
tric blankets, jugs, mixers, irons,
electric slippers (yes), hair-dryers,
quality blankets, embroidered sheets,
and high-grade towels. On Father’s
Day the same goes for handyman and
gardening tools, lawnmowers, and car
accessories.
At Christmas the shops look for-
ward to selling greatly increased vol-
umes of furniture and bedding, and
big-ticket electrical appliances such as
refrigerators, washing and washing-up
machines.
Increased sales in many fieldk have
certainly coincided (in recent years with
the increased “commercialisation” of
love. On the oth£r hand, it may be
that puritan feelings are still so strong
in us that we have to invent some
excuse for buying what we feel we
need to make life more comfortable:
that it was the desire to spend that
produced the habit of making tangible
public displays of love by exchanging
gifts rather than the other way around.
THE IMAGES OF LOVE
IT SEEMS significant that one of the
currently most talked about programs
on Australian television is a series
concerning the lives and loves of a
conservative Victorian family.
The romantic permutations in “The
Forsyte Saga” raise no eyebrows to-
day, and, enlightened as we all are by
the various moral revolutions we are
said to have undergone recently, we
should be unutterably bored by the
agonies of Irene and Soames.
But we aren’t—which points to the
fact that while the do’s and don’ts
of love may change, the basics in its
box-office appeal don’t. The big ques-
tions are still, “will they live happily
ever after?” or less romantically,
“what does he see in her?*’ or vice
versa. There’s self-identification in the
first, and human curiosity in the
second, and any love story which
doesn’t contain one or both ingredients
has little chance of success.
However, in “The Forsyte Saga”
marriage is what it has been at most
times and most places: an institution
in which the love of men and women
has to take its chance at growth and
survival against the love of position
and property. That was the whole
basis of Galsworthy’s saga, and it is
interesting that its fascination should
persist today. But, then, so many of
today’s stories of love in isolation, as
something which concerns only the two
people involved, grow tedious and thin.
" Last year, ABC-TV programmed a
fictionalised documentary which
examined the case for and against
love without marriage, but its analyti-
cal approach did little for its value
as entertainment, especially as all the
couple’s soul-searching didn’t bring
them to a decision.
Actually, Australian television, books,
and plays are taking a long time to
come to terms with love. Most novelists
and playwrights seem fond of more
prophetic themes, while television’s
attempts to portray it haven’t gone far
beyond the soap opera.; not that the
soap opera is a form to be despised.
“The Forsyte Saga,” despite its taste
and professionalism, is little more. But
the banality of something like the
ABC’s “Bellbird” and ATN’s “You
Can’t See Round Corners” makes the
difference.
In films, British realism and the
French New Wave have receded with-
out making an appreciable difference
to our view of love (only our view of
lovers we’re seeing more of them).
True, the happy ending is less preva-
lent than it used to be in Hollywood’s
heyday, but it’s still sought after. A
new American film, “Guess Who’s
Coming to Dinner,” dares to pose the
hoary old question, “would you let
your daughter marry a Negro?”, but
the real issue is “will they live happily
ever after?”
The young British women novelists,
firmly clutching their Oxbridge degrees
and copies of “Nova,” seem to be
taking love hardest, while Iris Mur-
doch, like some high priestess to Eros,
goes on weaving her literary mysteries
about love.
Of all of them, she has perhaps
done the most work on polishing the
facets of love’s image. By the time an
Iris Murdoch character has finished
his fiendish game of marital musical
chairs, we, and he, have experienced
all the alternatives to the one he’s
chosen something most of us never
manage to do, even in 1968.


THE FACES OF LOVE
TODAY, the feminine face of love has
more expressions than ever before.
Rules of beauty are tolerant enough
to admit Twiggy and Barbra Streisand
simultaneously, and to require less
artifice.
Or is the 1968 brand of artifice
supremely skilful at self-disguise?
Twiggy’s knock-kneed stride is almost a
parody of naturalness, in its way as
theatrical as Theda Bara’s dark-eyed
posturings in the 19205.
Nevertheless, today the uncultivated
look is being cultivated and whether
or not it takes more effort than it
seems to, it is more comfortably
assumed than most of the expressions
of beauty which have preceded it.
Imagine, for example, the sufferings
of the Gibson Girl of early Edwardian
times contorted into a swan-like
with the aid of a long, straight-
fronted corset and a “ ‘Neena’ bust-
improver modelled from the ‘Venus de
Milo’.”
And it wasn’t enough just to endure
these torments she had to maintain
“a high stance of the chin,” designed
to give her a faintly imperious, or at
least smugly self-satisfied, air.
The ’twenties, of course, brought
women what was called emancipation,
but was it worth it when fashion tyran-
nised them into taping their breasts
flat? By then, Hollywood had arrived,
and with it “the star” —a new face of
love.
Gentlemen preferred blondes, in tri-
bute to Mary Pickford, Carole Lom-
bard, and Jean Harlow, now remem-
bered as the screen’s first sex symbol—
something the ’fifties put into words
after the advent of Monroe. While
women stuck on false kiss-curls under
their cloche hats, men brilliantined
their hair and grew sideburns in an
effort to achieve the Latin suavity of
a Valentino or a Novarro.
But once the impact of the “talkies”
had been properly absorbed, there was
room for reality. If jug ears went
with Clark Gable’s tough charm, then
that was all right.
With the ’fifties came a new empha-
sis on sex in the cinema. Marilyn
Monroe, blonde, bosomy, and with her
paradoxically innocent “little girl”
voice, was the American ideal, while
the art cinemas introduced Australians
to Continental beauties Anna Mag-
nani, the ultimate in earth-mother
figures, and the voluptuous Gina Lollo-
brigida and Sophia Loren.
Teenagers, made conscious of their
status by the multiplicity of the mar-
kets catering for them, danced to Bill
Haley records, the girls burdened by
layers of tiered petticoats, the boys
affecting Presley-style quiffs and side-
burns.
Their idol was James Dean, whose
incoherence and apparent misery in-
spired every teenager who’d ever felt
a twinge of rebellion against parent or
teacher to identify with him.
A leather-jacketed Marlon Brando
in “The Wild One” appealed to
“rockers,” who still exist as “bikies”
today, the sack and the shift liberated
girls from petticoats, and by the ’sixties
a new ideal in teenage beauty had
emerged the “surfie.”
The ’sixties are a milestone, because
they have put an end to our obeisance
to the American face of love. It’s the
English style which dominates now
an unselfconsciousness about sex which
allows men to dress as flamboyantly
as women and feel no threat to their
masculinity, and women to dress in
mini-skirted freedom that emphasises
the grace of their bodies rather than
consciously exaggerating their femi-
ninity.
In a way, the two faces of love
are closer than they’ve ever been be-
fore brought together by wotnan’s
adherence to simplicity as a style and
man’s rediscovery of aestheticism.
Aubrey Beardsley’s face, so wrong for
his time, looks contemporary today.
THE LANGUAGE OF LOVE
UNDER THE EFFECTS of lazy
communication and modish jargon,
terms of endearment are now almost
outside the language of love. The word
“love” itself began to lose some of its
precise definition when shopgirls began
trading it across counters as “luv.”
(“Thanks, luv. That’ll be fourteen-and-
six.”) Now, though, men can be heard
calling each other “luv” (it’s a favorite
Richard Burtonism), and everyone, or
so it seems, calls everybody darling.
Such insincere endearments were
once the property of show business.
(“Darling, you were wonderful!”) or
jaunty servicemen expressing the war-
time privileges of their uniforms (“Let’s
have two cups of tea, sweetheart”),
but familiarity between the sexes has
grown to such an extent that complete
strangers now often exchange some of
the verbal tokens of love even before
they know each other’s names.
Situation and inflection still preserve
the exactness of the language for
lovers; for instance, “I love you”
remains a commitment, even if some-
times used expediently, and a mur-
mured “darling” at the right time still
says more than the punctuative “dar-
ling,” which often only means “mate”
or “miss.” It is a fact, though, that
influential word jugglers have debased
love’s language, none more than the
lyricists who contribute to the pop-
music industry.
The subject of love has sustained the
industry since it began; the synthetic
love of Tin Pan Alley probably
accounts for 98 percent of songs pub-
lished even though “love” has never
been satisfactorily thymed.
,Yet love expressed in song seems to
have become progressively meaningless.
The very monotonous repetition of the
word in the Beatles’ “All You Need Is
Love” makes it sound hollow and
heavily ironic. Perhaps that was their
intention; one is never very sure with
the capricious Beatles. But whatever
it is that they are saying, their empha-
sis is on the changing qualities of
love qualities that are separated by
more than time from the tender,
almost ingenuous, expressiveness of
Oscar Hammerstein 11, whose love
lyrics encompassed a love of everything
from corn as high as an elephant’s
eye to a northern June bustin’ out all
over.
A conveniently topical example of
pop-song love is “Honey,” in which
the lyricist keens for four or five
verses over a love for a. young wife
who has been killed by some unspeak-
able (and unspoken) tragedy, probably
in a road accident or by cancer. The
lyrics are no more banal than the
worst of them were in the 19405, but
the song is significantly interesting be-
cause it explores, if only superficially,
a tangible love relationship in such
maudlin terms. Even the title “Honey”
a Hollywood love word rendered
meaningless by overuse has a ring
of emptiness about it.
Once, entire plays or books were
constructed around a beribboned
bundle Of incriminating love letters.
Now, no one can be incriminated by
a telephone call or a greeting card
which expresses love as an insult. Men
and women still write love letters to
each other, but history won’t be able
to judge the great loves of the second
half of the 20th century by them.
THE TECHNOLOGY OF LOVE
IN WARM Californian pools, naked
in all their confusion, with rose petals
to fondle and each other’s fingers to
touch, five men and five women
“Christian names only, please”
murmur about their sexual inade-
quacies while psychiatrists sit by the
pool with pencils and notebooks. At
Washington University of Medicine
movie cameras photograph females
students, wives of faculty members, and
other volunteers at the moment of
orgasm. At the Reproduction Biology
Research Foundation of St. Louis,
prostitutes (male and female) enact


every sexual experience available to
the human imagination while white-
coated technicians measure their bodily
changes.
These are the extreme manifesta-
tions of the concept of love as a tech-
nology. Along with them go the con-
cepts of love as a craft epitomised
in the sex manuals with their diagrams,
or in deluxe editions of the “Kama
Sutra” with their pictures of Indian
female carvings.
Easily turned into absurdities, both
concepts, nevertheless, symbolise certain
improvements in the relations between
women and men. The fact that wives
have a right to full, if carefully con-
trived, sexual pleasure is now becoming
institutionalised in Western societies in
a way that is new, even if, like other
new things, this tendency caricatures
itself. To the observer it is still some-
times the caricatures that seem most
prominent the caricature of sex as
a kind of health cure (as if it were
not carried out by human beings) or
the alternative caricature of mutual
and simultaneously contrived satisfac-
tion as if it were the only true religion.
So far as technical progress in the
inhibition of pregnancy goes, mankind
is obviously moving toward the time
when every woman on earth will be
able to decide whether she will have
a baby or not. This is already taking
out of sexual activities some of that
sense of serious consequence that has
previously characterised them, but at
the same time the development in the
bacteria of the venereal diseases of a
resistance to “miracle cures” is restor-
ing some of that traditional fear of
promiscuity that, 20 years ago, looked
as if it might disappear for ever. In
either case, however, it seems likely
that sexual morality may go through
a permanent change, shifting perhaps
to a concern with sexual activity as a
relation between persons rather than
concern with the rightness or wrong-
ness in the act in itself.
THE FRUITS OF LOVE
DR. MARIE STOPES and the Pill
have helped to free love of one of its
consequences, and small families are
accordingly fashionable. But a parent’s
job has not become proportionately
simple.
One Sydney educationist recently
made the chilling prediction that the
child of the year 2000 will have to
know 2000 times as much as the
child of the year 1900 startling
news for parents still trying to cope
with the New Maths, the generation
gap, and McLuhan’s assertion that
their children are audio-tactile people,
a species they and their visual res-
ponses don’t have much in common
with, anyway.
But parents aren’t giving up yet,
despite the same educationist’s belief
that Australian schools are on the
“brink of an explosion of technology,”
and that within 20 years Mr. Chips
will be a push-button computer plug-
ged into a vast “memory bank,” which
a pupil will tap for information. The
teacher will be there, too to feed
the computer.
Today’s parents may miss out on
the tough times ahead, but some are
doing a preliminary round with the
New Maths at weekly evening classes.
“Down with sums,” the sentiment
behind the New Maths, is a refresh-
ing and encouraging catchcry. Other-
wise, Australian education 1968 style
is a solemn business. Politicians still
wrangle over State Aid, educationists
deplore the red tape in which edu-
cation comes wrapped, and parents
groan over the fact that they still
have to pay for it.
Meanwhile, the first products of
the Wyndham Plan worry about their
chances of getting to university, and,
forced by stringent university entrance
qualifications, try to make up their
minds about a career at the once
carefree age of 13.
Not that their parents aren’t
worried, too they still haven’t
evolved a satisfactory way of enlight-
ening their children about the facts
of life, according to a report made
by the Child Welfare Advisory
Council a few months ago.
Thirty-eight percent of illegitimate
children are born to girls between the
ages of 15 and 19, and about 40 per-
cent of unmarried mothers keep their
babies, in comparison with 27 percent
15 years ago.
But the ’sixties still haven’t evolved a
way to stop people neglecting their
children, or even an adequate method
for detecting cruelty to children.
Authorities have coined a new epithet
for it “the battered baby syn-
drome” and a committee appointed
by the Government found that cruelty
to children occurred “at all social
levels, sometimes without the know-
ledge of one of the parents,” but the
committee was also criticised for its
failure to be more specific about
methods of prevention.
The modern Mother has a new
dilemma to work or not to work.
Conservative educationists still tell her
no, she’ll feel too guilty about it for
her own and her children’s good. And
more progressive opinions tell her that
if she stifles her wish to take a job
she’ll relieve her frustration by being
harmfully over-protective toward her
child.
But if the educationists’ more ambi-
tious predictions about her children’s
future come to pass, perhaps she
should go back to school. Then she
would at least have a chance of being
able to hold a conversation with her
child when he’s an adult in tomorrow’s
computerland.
THE NEIGHBORLINESS OF LOVE
THE CHRISTIAN CONCERN for
love of humanity has been secularised
in so many ways in European civilisa-
tion that very few of the modern con-
cepts of progress whether they are
18th - century egalitarianism and
fraternalism or 20th-century welfare
statism cannot be traced back to
this source. This has led to a great
deal of claptrap and slaughter, but it
is also, surely, making our age the
most benevolent ever known, even if
the benevolence matches oddly with so
'much that is left over from the old
Adam.
Several decades ago both the prin-
cipal object of charity for the conser-
vatives and the principal agent of
change for the radicals was the prole-
tariat. Since the affluescence of the
industrialised nations has operated
most effectively in moving the less well-
off from the civilisation of the soup
kitchen to the civilisation of the super-
market, neither neighborly love nor
salvationary millenarian expectation
now looks to “the working class.” In
fact, there has been a backlash. Not
content that at least in the indus-
trialised nations, for the first time in
history, mankind can begin to live and
prosper without material misery, some
progressives have turned on the ordi-
nary people and attacked their
“materialis'm.”
Conscience still concerns itself with
the truly poor in the industrialised
nations, but much of it has shifted be-
yond national boundaries to that large
part of the world where life is still
constricted or, in some places, still
threatened by want. Nations are
ranked according to the percentage of
their GNP they spend on economic
assistance to the poor countries; huge
international bureaucracies of welfare
begin to grapple with the final destruc-
tion of poverty. Those who are most
enthusiastic are also usually most bitter
about the slowness of progress, but from
the viewpoint of history this is the age
in which the sense of neighborliness is
beginning for the first time to break
beyond national boundaries. It is also
the age in which, however tentatively
and ineptly, there is a realisation that
the tensions of racial tolerance might
finally be eased.
Compared with these extraordinary
achievements that poverty is being
reduced and can finally be dissolved
and that men of different races can
grow to accept their common humanity
the voguish dropping out of the
“hippies,” with their mishmashes of
mysticism, seems not an affirmation of
brotherly love but its opposite: the
glorification of self-importance.

Gorton came, saw, and changed his mind
ON HIS FIRST official pilgrimage
as Prime Minister to the land of his
wife’s birth, John Gorton arrived sus-
pecting that a United States with-
drawal from Asia’s mainland—possibly
even a retreat to the isolationism tradi-
tional in the United States and open
to exploitation by any White House
aspirant—was, if not a likelihood, then
a possibility.
It was this suspicion that caused Gor-
ton to preserve as one of his defence
options a “fortress Australia” policy
despite the pressure of those members
of his Party who wanted adherence to
the Menzies-Holt faith in “forward de-
fence.” Gorton himself escaped from
Singapore as a casualty still in band-
ages, after crashlanding his bullet-
damaged Hurricane on an air-strip
under attack and driving his face into
Prime Minister Gorton at the grave of
President John F. Kennedy in
Washington
his instrument panel to destroy for ever
his hitherto striking good looks. He
got out after surviving a torpedoing
that put him for 24 hours into the
water, whence he was rescued by the
Australian naval vessel Ballarat. He
was determined that, come what may,
he would not lengthen the odds of a
future generation of Australians being
locked up in Singapore, as so many
of his generation were, even if these
Australians would be few in number
as the members of a near-token force
kept in the area as a guarantee to
Malaysia-Singapore that Australia had
sympathy for and would support their
defence needs, with Britain withdraw-
ing in 1971.
If the United States got out, Gorton
was determined that Australia would
get out. He can see no direct threat
to Australia in the next five to ten
years. He held the view that, while
defence was important, defence in it-
self was a negative thing. Equally
important was what was being de-
fended. He wanted to be defending
an Australia that was dynamic and
developing, not one of stagnation and
sterility. Given this dynamism and
development, he believed that Australia
would be in a better position to defend
itself if a direct threat or threats
emerged in the next decade.
In other words, if the United States
were retreating into: isolationism, Aus-
tralia would be following it as fast as
it could. But Gorton came, saw, and
was conquered by the belief that, des-
pite the extraordinary dishevelment of
the American political scene, the likeli-
hood of the United States retreating
into isolation was remote that the
United States’ governing elite, both
actual and potential, was as seized as
Australia with the importance, both in
itself and to the world peace, of an era
in which more than half the world’s
inhabitants reside. In fact, instead of
him having to warn the United States’
rulers that they were retreating into
isolation, he was warned that he would
be putting the clock in Australia back
20 years if he abandoned the “forward
defence” policy of his predecessors in
regard to Singapore and Malaysia.
There are dangers, of course, in
accepting and planning future Austra-
lian defence policies upon an unquali-
fied belief that the United States will
not retreat, if not all the way to isola-
tionist, at least some of the way. Gor-
ton’s talks were almost exclusively with
the Johnson Administration, the main
personnel in which, including the Presi-
dent himself, will be out of office by
January, unless some unforseen con-
tingency emerges that will prevail upon
Johnson to alter his announced inten-
tion of not recontesting the Presidency.
But, despite the paucity of his contacts
with the so-far-announced Presidential
candidates Vice-President Humph-
rey, Senator Robert Kennedy, and
Senator Eugene McCarthy on the
Democratic side, and Richard Nixon
and Governor Nelson Rockefeller on
the Republican side Gorton appears
to have reached agreement with the
thesis argued by prominent !members
of the Johnson Administration and en-
dorsed publicly by Johnson himself.
This thesis was that Asia was too
important to the United States, and to
world peace, to permit an American
withdrawal until the area was stabilised
and the future of the small nations
there, which either supported America
or were neutral and had no desire
to be absorbed into the Communist
or any other world, was secured. This
would continue to be the situation
irrespective of who occupied the White
House, with the possible exception of
McCarthy. With Humphrey, Kennedy,
Nixon, or Rockefeller as President, the
changes in the Asian policy of the
present Johnson administration would
be marginal, not substantive.
American officials were quite
shocked (or were putting on the appear-
ance of being quite shocked) with what
they consider the queer Australian
attitude, with its obvious apprehension
of a retreat by the United States into
near-isolationism as far as Asia is
concerned. This is not justified by any
study of events, they argued. As Presi-
dent Johnson has publicly pointed out,
Senate speeches and things said in de-
bate should be put aside. What the
United States should be judged on is
what it has done and is doing.
The steadiness of United States
policy in the years since 1941, under
both Republican and Democratic
administrations, has denoted that the
United States and its people have un-
derstood the vital interests, for both
themselves and the world, at stake in
Asia and have acted upon them.
Gorton appears to have accepted
that, even with Kennedy in the White
House, U.S. Asian policy will change'
only marginally more.
The true paradox of the situation
was that Gorton arrived in America
fearing that America was retreating
from Asia, only to find himself being
reproached politely for even contem-
plating such a withdrawal on the part
of Australia.
The United States representatives
who talked with Gorton, including
President Johnson himself, emphasised
the desirability of Australia maintaining
its now entrenched defence links with
Malaysia and Singapore. Australia was
in a unique position. It was being asked
by Malaysia and Singapore to maintain
troops in the area, after the British
withdrawal in 1971 a rare tribute to
a country that had once contributed
forces to an occupying power.
The Americans argued that Aus-
tralia had consistently given leadership
to the area. It should not abandon
its leadership role by withdrawing
simultaneously with Britain and at a
time when leadership could result in
the area doing more for itself.
But here came the flaw in the posi-
tion of the United States’ governing
elite, both Democrats and Repub-
licans. Foreign affairs are influenced
by public pressures more in the Ameri-
can context than under our parliamen-
tary system. Gorton could not extract
any firm guarantee that if Australia
kept forces in the Malaysia-Singapore
area the United States would come
to its aid if, with Malaysia and Singa-
pore, it had more than it could handle.
Because domestic feelings have to be


By ALAN REID
who accompanied the Prime
Minister in America
considered, haziness crept in. Australia
had the ANZUS Treaty with the
United States, which provides that the
United States would step in if there
were attack upon the armed forces of
any of the signatories (New Zealand
is the other) in the Pacific area. If
anything went wrong, the United
States would not be looking at the fine
print to escape its responsibilities. But
public opinion would not accept any-
thing that appeared to be extending its
commitments anywhere, and particu-
larly in Asia after its experience in the
Vietnam conflict.
Australia would have to be content
with vague expressions of future good-
will and sympathy rather than a firm
guarantee. As Johnson had said
publicly at the White House dinner
to Gorton, he could not bind his sue-
cessors. But on the record of past
United States administrations of both
U.S. Secretary of Defence , Mr. Clark Clifford, puts his point
of view to Mr. Gorton
Democrat and Republican hues this
was not nearly so uncertain as it
seemed.
One thing which emerged unmis-
takably was Johnson’s genuine, deep-
seated, and almost emotional regard
for Australia. When he retires from
the White House, Australia will un-
doubtedly have three ambassadors in
the United States—the official Austra-
lian Ambassador, Sir Keith Waller, the
former U.S. Ambassador in Canberra,
Ed Clark, who proselytises so enthu-
siastically for Australia that if Australia
were an enemy and not a friend he
would be eligible for investigation for
activities on behalf of a foreign power,
and Johnson himself.
Johnson was clearly puzzled by what
he was going to encounter as Austra-
lian Prime Minister in place of Sir
Robert Menzies and the late Harold
Holt, who had given him unwavering
support in his desire to maintain
United States interest in Asia and Asia’s
importance to world peace. Various
Washington officials told me that he
was deeply troubled by Gorton’s un-
qualified statement that he would send
no more troops to Vietnam whatever
the circumstances, which appeared to
be a repudiation of Johnson’s as well
as the Menzies-Holt thesis that the
stakes in Vietnam were so vital to
Australia and to the future protection
of the rights of small nations as to
require the maintenance of an open-
ended attitude on commitments.
Though Gorton subsequently amended
statement in the Parliament, John-
son was undoubtedly puzzled about the
new form of Australian with whom he
h ac f t 0 d ea l-
It was to get the feeling of Gorton,
rather than to discuss serious business,
President Johnson and Mr. Gorton in the President’s office
after the official welcome
that a Johnson broke protocol and had
Gorton to dinner on the presidential
yacht, Sequoia, hours before the
official greeting ceremony. But the
two men undoubtedly established a
rapport. Johnson clearly liked Gor-
ton’s laconic, straightforward replies
to questions. Gorton equally clearly
liked Johnson. Gorton made it clear
that, while Australia would make its
own foreign policy decisions, American
and Australian viewpoints were so
close that it was unlikely they would
find themselves often in disagreement.
Johnson did everything he could to
help Gorton and to relieve Australia’s
fears. In public, he condemned isola-
tionism and emphasised the necessity
for the United States to continue to
recognise the importance, to the United
States and humanity generally, of the
future of Asia. In private, he affirmed
that all the influence of those asso-
ciated with his administration—an influ-
ence still significant in the Democrat
Party, even if those wielding it were
not in official positions—would be
exerted to maintain this line a far
from valueless pledge in view of the
continuing influence exercised by ex-
Presidents on the American political
scene.
What has Gorton achieved?
Nothing concrete. But he never
expected to achieve anything concrete,
But once he has made a value judg-
ment on the worth of what was said to
him, particularly on the likelihood of
the United States maintaining both an
interest and a continuing presence in
Asia, he is in a far better position to
deal with the problems that will arise
out of the talks next week between
Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia,
Singapore, and the United Kingdom
on the stability of South-East Asia in
the light of Britain’s 1971 withdrawal;
and the question whether Australia
should, for psychological reasons, main-
tain a military presence, however small,
in the area, as requested by both
Malaysia and Singapore.
My impression is that Gorton will
indeed has—formed the judgment that
America will continue a substantial
presence in Asia unless McCarthy is
elected to the White House, a con-
tingency which Gorton as yet regards
as unlikely but which would then
require revision of his judgment,
On what occurred during Gorton’s
visit it is likely that the Menzies-Holt
concept of “forward defence” will
prevail against “fortress Australia” at
least for a time, and until it becomes
finally clear who is to be the new
occupant of the White House.

Brain versus computer
By NIGEL CALDER
ACCORDING to current thinking
among the experts, there is no conflict:
the computer is a domesticated
machine, which is being steadily
adapted to serve men better, always to
augment human brainpower, never to
challenge it. “Man-machine interaction”
is the slogan of the times. Men and
machines will work together in benign
symbiosis, with the man at his personal
console contributing the imagination,
ideas, and questions, while the com-
puter sorts and calculates as quick as
a flash.
This touching picture has a lot of
reality in it. Multi-access systems,
whereby many users can apply directly
to the machine at their own con-
venience, remove the administrative
barrier to interaction. Conversational
modes of operation are making com-
puters literally child’s play. Associated
boxes of tricks turn the architect’s
sketches into neat, computable diagrams,
or allow the doctor to hand over a
patient to direct monitoring by the
machine.
Nor, with more urgent things to deal
with, is it worth losing sleep over the
remote, science-fiction vision of
machines growing independent of men
and eventually “rebelling.” One would
be rash to dismiss the possibility of such
independence, and even in current
technology, with computers helping to
design, build, and program computers,
there are hints as to how it might arise.
Hannes Alfven, the Swedish physicist,
in his pseudonymous book “The Great
Computer,” outlines a plausible route.
Yet it will be some decades before men
are able, let alone willing, to omit the
“Off” switch from the machines, or
give them direct access to energy and
raw materials.
But will we abdicate to the com-
puter? That possibility arises already;
in fact, it is no longer a question of
whether we abdicate but how much.
To what extent should we allow com-
puters, applied at a high level of
decision-making in government and
other activities, to determine our
actions? I can hear the rustle of rising
hackles among the computer experts.
“It’s not like that at all, as you know
perfectly well. Even operating at
Parliament House, the computer would
not be a little tin god telling the Prime
Minister what to do. The machine
merely gives the results of complicated
analyses, done according to programs
written by human beings. It can make
the Prime Minister, or anyone else,
better informed, and may even suggest
courses of action, but it no more makes
the decision than the engineer’s slide
rule designs the bridge. Computer pro-
poses; man disposes. Nor need it ever
be otherwise.”
The trouble with such reassurances
is that they neglect psychological atti-
tudes to computers. As people grow
accustomed to one generation of
machines with rudimentary applications,
another, far more powerful and with
more sophisticated programs, arrives to
keep them amazed. Awe may be avoid-
able, to some extent, by making a point
of familiarising everyone with the
nature and limitations of the machines,
as a routine element in education.
No understanding of the hardware
and software can save us from the fact
that the computer is already a machine
of fantastic power. What is more, it is
powerful in the very quality that 20th-
century men most admire and feel most
lacking in themselves rationality.
The computer is pre-eminently an
embodiment of uncontaminated logic,
able to make unerring deductions at
high speed from volumes of informa-
tion with which no human being could
cope. It magnifies the role of pure
reason in human affairs. If you recoil
from the idea of being led by com-
puters, you must believe that the human
brain, the only serious rival to the com-
puter for ordering our affairs, has other
qualities and interests.
The answer to the question of how
much we should abdicate to the com-
puter depends in part on a competitive
evaluation of brains and computers. It
also depends on how serious we are
when we complain that our current
international and social ills arise from
irrationality.
The capacity of computers has grown
so great and so variable that it is
meaningless to record the computer ex-
plosion by cumulative counts of
machines without inquiring about their
age and performance. At the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology, computing
capacity doubles every two years; for
the world as a whole the rate is prob-
ably not very different. Besides the
engineering progression from valves to
transistors to integrated circuits, big
advances in organisation and program-
ming methods have taken place in
part just to keep up with the growing
complexity and speed of the machines,
but in part also to make them easier
or more versatile to use.

roughs is building Illiac IV for the U.S.

Defence Department. Many details are
still classified, but it is to be 500 times
faster than any existing computer; the
makers claim it will be 100 times faster
than any other machine under
development. It can legitimately be
called a supercomputer because it is
an assembly of 256 processors working
independently or collectively, as
required by the four control units.
Individually the processors are remark-
able enough; they incorporate the
latest high-speed technology of “large-
scale integration” on silicon chips,
with working circuits so small that
6000 would not cover a postage stamp.
But Illiac IV is also important because
the designers tackle organisational
problems of interconnected networks of
computers the sort of thing that will
one day encase the globe in a ringing
welkin of electronic information.
The direct practical significance of
Illiac IV is that it will make problems
of extreme complexity accessible to
computing. When the first crude com-
puters appeared in the 1940 s we learned
that their speed permitted calculations
to be done that had always been possible
in theory but would have simply taken
too many man-years to attempt.
Even for the powerful machines of
today, there are inaccessible problems,
the most obvious being in meteorology.
Although some weather men still think
there is a residual element of chance
in the workings of the atmospheric
engine, the general belief of leading re-
searchers is that, in principle, the
weather can be calculated days or weeks
in advance. They have mathematical
models of the atmosphere which are
really pretty good already. They need
more information about the current
weather, and the World Weather Watch
has been instituted for that purpose.
But, most of all, they need much more
powerful computers. At present, they
are frustrated because using the best
models the machine takes more than
a day to compute what the change in
weather will be in the course of a day.
No one is waiting more eagerly for
Illiac IV than the meteorologists at the
U.S. National Centre for Atmospheric
Research in Colorado.
The workings of a nation’s economy
and the interactions of its elements
comprise a problem of comparable
complexity. Until computers came
along, mathematical models in econo-
mics were of little more than academic
interest. Now there are plenty of practi-
cal uses for mathematical models of
the operations of individual businesses,
and the first brave attempts are being
made to put detailed models of the
national economy on computers.
It is not premature to look to models
of other elements of planning, to try
to find the “best” ways of using scarce
resources, of distributing people in
cities, of siting industrial plant around
the country, of organising transport and
communications,, and so on. Such
models will allow rational comparison
of alternative policies by forecasting the
consequences of, say, raising and lower-
ing the bank rate, or saving or not
saving the coal industry. It would be
wrong to envisage all this activity as
monolithic, a single model on a single
computer. Rather, there will be plenty
of decentralisation, with local models of
business and regional plans in a give-
and-take relation with the models of
central government.
The primitive applications of com-
puters for payroll or indexing, for ex-
ample, merely replace robot-like activi-
ties of men with a more appropriate
mechanism. But now, for the first time,
complex systems of many kinds are be-
coming susceptible to rational analysis
that is also quick enough to be useful
in what the computer men call “real
time.” Where hunches previously had
to serve, calculation becomes possible;
where formerly it was impossible to
organise and comprehend all the avail-
able information on a complex subject
for example, in history it- is no
longer far-fetched to think of doing so.
The social sciences and the humanities
probably stand to gain more, in the long
run, from the new capacity for dealing
with complexity than do the natural
sciences, which have long been accus-
tomed to simplifying reality. But
biology will benefit, too, especially in
studies of ecology, of molecular pro-
cesses, of the brain itself.
Such is the promise of the super-
computers fast, versatile, intercon-


nected machines and the programs
being devised for them. The invention
of the computer will probably prove to
be of much greater consequence for
personal and national life, and for
human thought, than the invention of
the heat engine; we have to go back
to the invention of writing for some-
thing comparable. At the beginning of
only the third decade of the computer
era, we are more likely to under-
estimate than to exaggerate the possi-
bilities. The practical folk who began
writing could not have foreseen all the
implications of cumulative knowledge;
as men begin to escape from limitations
set by the speed and memory of the
human brain, who can tell where they
will end up?
A child quickly learns to recognise
the figure 4, whether it is printed neatly
in a book, scrawled clumsily in chalk
on a blackboard, or planted in tulips
in a park. Persuading computers to
recognise characters, even when they
are presented in approximately stan-
dard style, has proved to be exception-
ally tricky. Hence those funny numerals
on cheques. Machine translation of
texts, aiming beyond mere translitera-
tion, has also failed to develop satis-
factorily despite many years of work.
And although mechanisation of indexing
and cataloguing in libraries is very
effective at the routine level, what still
seems extremely difficult is to match
human ways of thinking when it comes
to translating an ill-defined interest into
a finite set of appropriate texts —the
sort of thing a human librarian takes
in his stride after a quick conversation
with the library user.
These are not abstract problems, nor
are they neglected. O.n the contrary,
the hiatus is embarrassing to a lot of
people. Plardware is becoming available
that will make it possible, in principle
at least, to store all man’s information
in electronic systems, and deliver any
portion of it anywhere, on demand.
Practical difficulties of injecting the
material into the system, and concep-
tual difficulties of retrieving it in useful
portions and combinations, threaten to
thwart this development. Nowhere is
this mismatch of computers and human
thinking more worrying than in the
existing computerised intelligence
agencies.
In the early days of computers,
journalists named them “electronic
brains.” Then a reaction set in: today
it is orthodox to say the computer is a
moronic calculator, unable to think for
itself or to respond spontaneously to
the unexpected. The very fact that a
human slip can completely frustrate a
computer program shows how depen-
dent is the machine on jts operators
for all its clever tricks. At present, that
dependence means that the computer
need not, and should not, acquire any
authority, because all the intelligence
and judgment are coming from the pro-
grammers and the users they serve. I
still fear that the non-stupid product
of the stupid machine may hypnotise
us. In any case, our comfortable
superiority will not last long. Tern-
porarily programming a machine to do
a particular job according to a
sequence of instructions is one thing;
and permanently programming it to act
in an intelligent way quite another.
That is an objective of current research.
“Machine intelligence” is now a pursuit
dignified with at least one professorial
chair (in Edinburgh) and going on in
a number of centres.
Semantic or philosoph'cal quibbles
are out of place here: inte’ligence in
machines means, to the experts, the
ability to convince human beings—by
conventional intelligence tests if need
be—that intelligence is at work inside
the box. In one limited but important
sense, the main thrust of conventional
computer development is also making
the machines more intelligent: to sim-
plify programming and man-machine
interaction, the computers are being
provided increasingly with means of
self-programming. In other words,
problems are presented to them badly,
and they work out the detailed
sequences of operations they must fol-
low. In humans, the ability to break
down problems into a series of steps is
one mark of intelligence.
The “machine intelligence” sped-

ence, experimenting with various possi-
bilities to find the best way of tackling
a problem, looking for quick, rough
routes to stated goals instead of elab-
orately trying to compute exact ones —
these are marks of the versatility and
intelligence they seek. Excessive opti-

sation of thought processes put the idea

of intelligent machines in disrepute for
a while, but now methodical work is
making definite headway. Of their two
main routes, one involves building
special machines working on different
and intrinsically more intelligent prin-
ciples than the digital computer. The
other, at present favored, relies on
special programs written for conven-
tional computers.
The quest for machine intelligence,
being concerned with mimicry of
human performance in machines, is
relatable to current research on the
brain itself. It also helps to focus
attention tin detailed differences
between computers and brains. The
engineers know exactly how present
computers work, but the programmers
are only gradually finding out how to
exploit them to the full. We know a
great deal, subjectively and objectively,
about what the brain can do, but less
about how it does it.
Telephone exchange, gramophone,
computer—the technology of communi-
cations and information has for long
been providing analogies for the way
the brain may work. This year it is
the “hologram,” the jumbled kind of
picture taken with laser light, and con-
taining much more information than
conventional photographs. It suggests
a way of explaining how, for example,
a simple question can trigger the recall
by the brain of a lot of organised
information. Analogies are often
helpful, or at least reassuring, but
plainly the brain is much more subtle
than any machine men have hit upon
yet. The scientific forces are building
up for what may be, during the next
decade or so, the final assault on the
central mystery of how the brain works,
At this stage all anyone can say with
confidence is that the brain operates on
quite different piinciples fiom the corn-

cells depend upon chemical processes.
And memory involves, at least in part,
the production of large and complex
molecules. This last point, which has
been controversial, now seems to be
established. In a very recent and strik-
ing experiment, a group in Belgrade
succeeded in erasing conditioned reflexes
from the brains of cats by injecting bio-
chemical agents antibodies that
reacted with brain protein.
Organisationally, too, the brain has a
style of its own. A computer has a com-
paratively small number of working
components, but it carries out many
thousands of operations in a second.
The brain has many more components
(about 10,000 million nerve cells) and
it seems to use very many of them
in each operation, just a few times a
second. The lower, less sophisticated
parts of the brain work more like com-
puters than does the cerebral cortex,
though still with notably different
logical arrangements. The eye, which
is in effect an exposed part of the
brain, is no mere television camera. The
impulses generated by light striking the
retina are converted into a form useful
to the brain, as different qualities of
the light and the image activate dif-
ferent kinds of cells. Classic experiments
by Keffer Hartline in the United States,
on the eye of a horseshoe crab, showed
how “lateral inhibition” between ad-
jacent cells serves to sharpen the con-
trast, to emphasise color and movement,
and to enable the eye to begin the pro-
cess of evaluating what it sees.
The most obvious difference of all
between the brain and the computer is
that the brain is connected to a living
body. Indeed, connected is too aloof
a word. The brain is an integral part
of that body, sharing in all its mechan-
isms, efforts, satisfactions, and pains.
Starting in the cradle, the brain learns
from the experience of its young owner;
the “programs” and “data store”
accumulate slowly in the context of
intense emotions. The psychologist can
tell us a great deal about the “cor-
ruption” of pure rationality and com-
puter-like mental performance by the
emotional memories associated with
learning and thinking. The biochemist
can instruct us in the natural “drugs”
that the body deploys in response to
circumstances, which influence mood,
thought, and behaviour. The brain
physiologist can pinpoint centres in the
lower brain that are not passive bridges
between body and upper brain but are
responsible for “drives” and emotional
behaviour.
Arranging for a machine to show
emotional behaviour to make it simu-
late fear, angqr, sorrow, and so on is
not difficult. Leaving aside philosophical
conundrums about self-conscious experi-
ence in a box of electronics, there is an
elementary reason why natural emotion
in men is a quite different thing from
programmed emotion in machines.
Human emotion serves identifiable
biological purposes and passed the very
harsh and searching tests of evolution,
palaeolithic survival, and modern stress.
But some hold that our qmotions are
dangerously obsolete for the scientific
world that men have made. By stan-
dards of cool rationality, we seem
inferior to machines. Here, I believe,
we approach the crux of the matter,
in deciding about abdication to the
computer.
Reason has hitherto had only a sup-
porting role in human affairs. Common-
sense, which is ad hoc reasoning, is
notoriously unreliable, instructing us
variously that the sun goes round the
earth, that beating children is good for
them, that unemployment is the
remedy for economic disorder. Science
itself, popularly misconceived as the
most logical of human activities, pro-
ceeds by kangaroo-like bounds in quest
of the joyful sensation of the new idea;
only when that is found is the repertoire
of methodology brought into play to
check it. In politics, it is hard to think
of a single act of any significance taken
on rational grounds derived by exer-
cise of logic from purely objective
premises. Is that bad? Yes, plainly,
when the “irrational” elements are bad.
But, if most of the emotional drives
had not usually been either constructive
or fairly harmless, men would not have
prospered so long, nor advanced in
numbers, knowledge, and social well-
being. The biological success touch
wood of the species is the more
remarkable seeing that we switched
from the hunting for which we evblved,
to farming, machine-minding, and pen-
pushing. In shaping our future, we
should, perhaps, make more allowance
for our bloodthirsty origins.
But why all the yearning for reason,
and distrust of emotion? They arise,
surely, because people say reason when
they intend reasonableness, and talk of
emotion when they mean blustering. I
certainly believe that civilisation will
be destroyed unless we act reasonably,
but that means something much more
than reason there is a lot of altruism
and self-confident restraint mixed up in
it, not to mention ldve. Big political
issues facing us now include the end-
ing of war, the breaking of the white
man’s monopoly of science and wealth,
and, in the rich countries, the need for
better goals than the pursuit of wealth
and technology for their own sake. In
these cases, emotional commitment is
needed first. Then we shall want all
the rationality we can muster for tack-
ling the complex details. At present
much more blind reason supported
with computers goes into planning
for war and into raising the white
man’s standard of living than serves
the contrary purposes.
The present scdpe of man’s rationality
is limited, not only in dealing with
emotional human beings but in its very
own heartland of logic and ordered
knowledge. Mathematicans know
systems of logic other than the binary
true-false of everyday practice. A
celebrated mathematical problem, the
prisoner’s dilemma, can only be resolved
by appeal to a metalogic involving
notions that would normally be called

irrational. We know enough science to
sense our great ignorance in important
areas, especially in what are now called
the behavioural sciences. The human
brain improvises and, by rational
intuitive, imaginative, and emotional
processes so far unexplained, stands in
for all the sciences that have not yet
been invented. It also must substitute
for all the types of computers we shall
never get around to building:

More than cool reason ever com-
prehends.
To note all that is not to defend
sloppy thinking or whimsical govern-
ment. Nor do I intend any Luddite
attack on the computer, in outlining its
differences from the brain. Powerful
computer systems and, eventually, intel-
ligent machines will bring immense
economic and social benefits, and the
sooner politicians and administrators
learn how to employ them the better.
As a means of obtaining information
and opinions from the periphery, com-
puter networks can promote decentrali-
sation of political power. Wisely
used, they are a vehicle of personal
service, of individuality, of infinite
variety. They should also rescue us
from our meritocratic error of over-
valuing measurable intelligence in judg-
ing individuals. When computers ds>
much of the work for which intelligence
is thought necessary, other virtues in
the human spectrum may receive more
attention. Meanwhile, better self-
understanding, and self-esteem, will
come from research on the human
brain.
So what is worrying me? Essentially,
the accidents of computability. Some
matters are suited to analysis by arith-
metic and binary logic, others are not.
Computer men like to say that one of
the benefits of computerisation is that
it forces you to think clearly and. logic-
ally; but it also forces you to leave out
the intangibles—or else make sweeping
assumptions about them. That does not
matter, so long as we keep computa-
tion in its place. But will we? With
computable problems we shall be able
to make much more impressive head-
way than we can with non-computable
problems. By all too easy conditioning,
we may come to regard as politically
important whatever is computable,
and to think that non-computable
problems are non-problems. That will
be tantamount to abdication.
For contemporary illustrations, con-
sider first the strategic use of com-
puters. Once political judgment has
been ousted by computable war-game
ideas, there remains no index of suc-
cess or failure except the system’s own
built-in assumptions; the moral and
political intangibles are excluded and
combative policies become self-justify-
ing, at least until such time when even
the most patriotic citizen sees that they
have gone wrong. Again, if we could not
measure national economic growth to
within one percent or so, we should not
be able to worry about it so much, nor
keep as anxious an eye on the annual

scoreboard. Such ignorance would be a
very bad thing, rationally, but it might
at least save us from the pseudo-
rational pursuit of economic growth at
all costs. As a third example, physical
disease is much more easily detectable
and quantifiable than mental disease,
so there is imbalance in the clinical
and research effort in favor of treat-
ing physical disease. (Perhaps the neg-
lect of preventive medicine arises for
similar reasons you can’t keep a
very convincing score of non-patients.)
There are subsidiary, related risks:
mathematical models, which are
hypotheses, may come to look like social
laws; the “optimised” planning that
computers make so easy is full of pit-
falls; departures from predicted be-
haviour by individuals may seem per-
verse and anti-social under a carefully
computed plan.
The picture that haunts some of us
is of a computer system in a capital
city or mountain stronghold, swallow-
ing a gargantuan diet of military intelli-
gence, chattering away usefully for
years—and then suddenly printing out:
GO TO WAR. Of course, unless the
programmer had a nice sense of drama,
the wording would not be quite like
that; but the picture is not necessarily
fictional. The human commander will
know that the machine has made
analyses and computations he can never
match by routes he could not follow.
There may be no time to check or even
recapitulate the data; the rules fed into
the machine years previously may be
only hazily remembered. Never mind
about possible electronic faults the
scope for past errors in programming
and data will seem starkly obvious to
the commander confronted with this
result. How can we make sure human
beings are never put in so intolerable
a situation?
If we reaffirm the non-computability
of human factors and the non-rational
root of our value systems, we need not
go so far wrong. Then it will be clearer
how we should draw the line in giving
scope to the computer in policy-making.
The safeguards will be procedural
rather than a matter of a fixed code.
Every high-level use of the computer
will be challenged on principle. That
should not be done in an anti-
technological mood, but simply to make
certain that the goals, the assumptions
of the model, and the quality of the
data are reviewed and that, where short-
comings and grounds for controversy
exist, these are debated. Existing models
will be re-examined at regular intervals
in the same spirit.
Given such monitoring, computerisa-
tion can have a most constructive
effect. It will oblige us to consider our
goals and motives more clearly and
explicitly than ever before. It will con-
tinually remind us of our lacunae of
knowledge and the limits of rationality.
Also, by relieving us of mental
drudgery, it will give us the leisure to
think about (and enjoy!) the uncom-
putable.

Cook Islands await
rediscovery
By ANTHONY HAAS
THE NEWLY self-governing Cook
Islands have achieved a deal with New
Zealand which serves as an example
for any colonies still around which
have not yet achieved independence.
What happens now is that the sue-
cesses and failures of running the Cook
Islands are now made by Cook
Islanders with New Zealand money,
rather than by New Zealanders with
New Zealand money.
Until 1965, the 20,000 people who
live on the 15 islands scattered over
80,000 square miles of South Pacific
Ocean, were administered by a New
Zealand resident commissioner. On
becoming self-governing, the islanders
were adamant that they had to retain
their New Zealand citizenship, their
access to New Zealand, and their right
to the $2-million-a-year subsidy that
provides 70 percent of their budget.
After World War II New Zealand
slowly gave Cook Islands more control
over their own affairs. In 1960, when
the United Nations Committee on
Colonialism passed its notable reso-
lution calling for independence for all
colonial territories irrespective of social,
economic, or political conditions, New
Zealand’s then Minister for Island
Territories, Mr. (now Sir) Leon Gotz,
offered the Cook Islands, either inde-
pendence, integration with New Zea-
land, association with a Polynesian
Federation or what he recommended
and what they chose—self-government.
The Cook Islanders have New Zea-
land firmly at the centre of their
international picture. Some other South
Pacific territories are beginning to
mean something to them, but Australia
is as remote as Kuala Lumpur, or
as Perth is to Wellington.
The explanation is historical. In the
rush to carve up the Pacific late last
century and early this one, Australia,
New Zealand, Britain, and France all
grabbed a bit. None of the acqui-
sitions was so important that any other
country would covet it. So the Cooks
remained a New Zealand outpost of
Richard John Seddon’s empire. Sed-
don was New Zealand Premier at the
turn of the century and felt his dignity
demanded acquisition of these sup-
posedly lucrative South Seas islands.
Australia has a few trading links
with the Cooks: rather, she sells the
group milk powder, rice, canned fruits,
preserved vegetables, spirits, timber,
live plants and cuttings, lubricating oil,
gas, medicines, plastics, chemicals,
saddlery, fabrics, glass, iron and steel,
agricultural machinery, electrical
equipment, and a number of other
odds and ends, including the motor-
scooter, which has caused a communi-
cations revolution on Rarotonga. In
return Australia buys nothing at all.
Australian construction firms may
have a chance to compete for tenders
for the real communications revolu-
tion in the Cooks later this year when
the New Zealand Government decides
who will build the $6.3 million inter-
national airport on Rarotonga. No
decision has yet been taken to open
tenders to overseas companies. Several
New Zealand firms are interested.
When this airport is finished, in 1971,
life should be very different on the
Cooks. When the New Zealand Cabi-
net gave the green light on the pro-
ject it not only gave Air New Zealand
a welcome boost but the Cook Islands
were given a new economic dimension.
The Cooks are at present so badly
served by regular air and sea services
that there are three weekly New. Zea-
land Air Force DC6 or Hercules flights
to get mail and passengers to and
from.

rights on Rarotonga. These will be
traded for access to valuable U.S.
points such as New York. At least
six American airlines are interested in
the South Pacific run, according to Air
New Zealand. New Zealand may not
only get her money back on the air-
port but a $2 million annual profit.
The airport may mean that the
Cook Islands’ earnings will overtake
outgoings and wipe out the annual
subsidy. But the earnings will be New
Zealand’s unless someone has a change
of heart in Wellington.
Although the subsidy seems to be
administered liberally and is set every
three years to enable some forward
planning, the subject was an issue at
the Cook Islands general election on
May 1. The Premier, Albert Henry,
and his ruling Cook Island Party and
Opposition, the new United Cook
Islanders Party, were for decreased
dependence on New Zealand.*
In spite of the vast and complicated
squabbles with some of his own Cabi-
net as well as the Opposition, Albert
Henry was returned at the election.
Three years of his charismatic leader-
ship had evidently given the 7000 elec-
tors a taste for more. Other men may
have been as able administratively, but
none had his political appeal.
At present, Australian National
University Ph.D. student David Stone
is trying to assess Albert Henry’s elec-
toral appeal. Henry has oratorical
gifts; he is the leader and founder of
the Cook Islands Party, whieh has 60
percent of the voters on. the capital
island of Rarotonga as members; he
spent 20 years before self-government
in New Zealand working for himself
and for his people; it was he who got
the subsidy from New Zealand. There
are 10,000 Cook Islanders in New
Zealand and many of them keep very
strong ties with home to the extent
of sending regular remittances to their
families, so that the older generation,
at least, knew him well.
The Opposition claimed that the
younger voters had gone against their
parents and supported it. This does
not seem to be entirely true, but most
of the better-educated Cook Islanders,
including those who have scholarships
to study in New Zealand, did support
the Opposition Party.
Discontent could grow as tradition is
weakened further by the impact of the
airport and the onrush of tourism.
Tourism will bring job opportunities
but, as has happened elsewhere, once
tourism comes, local fishing and agri-
culture will suffer. The best new
prospect is citrus fruits, which, if in
enough volume, could compete with
Australian exports to New Zealand.
Three years of self-government have
given this unique form of international
association between New Zealand and
the Cook Islands a chance to show its
strengths and weaknesses. The next
three years should see big changes.

with
miniatures
for the maximum in flavour
at the minimum in cost
Renowned international chefs have long
recognised how a great liqueur can
transform a simple recipe into a gourmet’s
delight.
Now you can secure a miniature of any
of these four distinguished liqueurs,
Tia Maria, Grand Marnier, Cherry Heering
and Stega and . . .
for less than 70 cents try these
award-winning desserts:
GRAND MARNIER
While this centuries’ old French orange
brandy can add excellence to a classical
main course, such as Duckling a I’Orange,
it has won wide repute in pancakes and
souffles. Try this recipe for Grand Marnier
Pancakes (makes about 12):
y 4 lb Flour, 1 oz Castor Sugar
1 oz melted Butter, 2 whole Eggs
1 pinch of Salt, Vz Pint of cold Milk
3 teaspoons Grand Marnier.
Put the flour, previously sifted, in an
earthenware mixing bowl, break the eggs
into it, add the salt, sugar and a little
cold milk. Mix this well to avoid lumps
and progressively thin the mixture with
the remainder of the milk to obtain a
very smooth and light batter.
Add the melted butter (if the batter has
formed any lumps, strain it before adding
the butter).
Lastly, add 3 teaspoonfuls of Grand
Marnier. Preferably, make this batter
2 or 3 hours before it is required.
Do the pancakes thin enough. At the
moment of serving sprinkle with castor
sugar and Grand Marnier. Serve very
hot.
If you wish to serve the pancakes
flaming (Flambee), arrange them on a
heatproof dish, sprinkle with sugar, add
a slice of orange and a few little knobs
of butter and a glass of Grand
Marnier Cordon Rouge. Heat the
whole and set alight, baste with the
liquid whilst the dish is flaming.
CHERRY HEERING
Pour a little of Denmark’s famed cherry
brandy, Cherry Heering, on grapefruit
before serving for a more piquant
flavour.
Or, with sliced fresh fruits, add toasted
chopped almonds, a nip of Cherry
Heering and chill well. Serve with ice
cream or whipped cream.
STREGA
Italy’s top liqueur, a tantalising blend of
more than 70 herbs, enriches sweets,
cakes and puddings.-One favourite is
Strega Peach Freeze. Force peaches,
sweetened with water and sugar, through
a sieve. Add a. few drops of vanilla, half
a teaspoon of lemon juice, melted fruit
jelly, and a nip of Strega. Pour into a
mould and chill for two hours.
TIA MARIA
Jamaica’s great coffee liqueur, Tia Maria
can be added /to any dessert or cake
where coffee is included. Add it to cream
before whipping. Or merely splash it
over ice cream. Float whipped cream,
flavoured with Tia Maria, on your after-
dinner coffee.
All four liqueurs available in miniatures,
13 oz and 26 oz bottles at all leading
liquor stores.

Here is a name to fasten on to
ajax
Ajax bolts and nuts are pro-
duced in their millions every
day by McPherson’s in
one of the world’s largest
bolt works. The Ajax range
is wide, too bolts, nuts,
spikes, washers, rivets,
coach screws, set screws,
studs and insulator pins
all in a variety of sizes and
finishes. Moreover, McPher-
son’s ensure that each one
of these small but essential
components meets the most
rigid specifications. Con-
stant research and labora-
tory testing of materials with
exhaustive checking during
production are part of
McPherson’s quality control
methods. And McPherson’s
laboratories are registered
by the National Association
of Testing Authorities. That
is why you can safely fasten
on to the name Ajax. It
means more in nuts and
bolts dependability.

BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY
Stirring up the oily waters
ONE THING now seems certain in
the fuss over oil prices; following Sen-
ator Gair’s statement last week the
public will not have to carry the cost
of the 75 cents a barrel incentive pay-
ment to local producers after the Gov-
ernment’s agreement with them runs out
in 1970. For no matter what the Gov-
ernment thinks, the DLP, which holds
the balance of power in the Senate, has
made up its mind. Not that its decision
was ever in doubt, because Vince Gair
has never been a fan of the big inter-
national oil companies.
In 1956, Vince Gair, as Premier of
Queensland, told the oil companies:
“Your attitude is no different from that
of the Communists. If the result of
arbitration doesn’t suit you, you go on
strike.” Gair’s prices commissioner had
said there was no justification for a
rise in petrol prices, but the oil com-
panies said that unless they got the rise
they would withdraw supplies. Gair
called their bluff and proceeded to
arrange alternative supplies. Petrol
refined in Taiwan was acquired through
a broker and legislation introduced re-
quiring petrol stations to distribute the
petrol.
The scheme foundered on the split
in the Labor Party, since breakaway
elements joined with the Country Party
Government to repeal the legislation
and allow the oil companies to raise
their prices.
Twelve years later, Senator Gair, as
leader of the DLP in the Federal
Parliament, is causing trouble in oily
waters again. Last Thursday he
launched an attack on the Government’s
oil policy. He said: “The DLP will use
every opportunity and exercise any
influence it possesses to change the
Government’s present inane and illogi-
cal policy on petroleum production.
“The estimated figures of petroleum
production and the money involved in
the incentive payment make it clear
that we are heading for a price increase
of not less than five cents per gallon.
“Such an increase would be an un-
warranted and unjust impost on the
Australian public, especially now that
large fields of oil have been discovered
in Australia.
“The Government’s policy means, in
effect, that the Australian people will
not profit from the recent discoveries of
oil in Australia. All the effort expended
on petroleum production over the years
has been to no avail if the discoveries
only result in an increased price per
gallon.
Senator Gair —launching an attack
“The individual motorist will feel
it, secondary industry, primary in-
dustry, and the economy generally
will feel it. It will have far-reaching
repercussions. It will cause an increase
in transport charges and indeed in the
price of every commodity.
“The present Government policy had
its origin in 1965 when Mr. McEwen
played Santa Claus to overseas oil com-
panies by granting 75 cents (U.S.) per
barrel as an incentive, which was 50
cents in excess or that recommended by
the Tariff Board.
“It is clear that the policy has to be
changed without delay. An increase in
the price of petrol cannot be justified,
especially in the light of the Australian
discoveries, and the Government ought
to note how politically indefensible such
a price increase would be.”
With three colleagues in the Senate,
Gair will be able to have a decisive say
in any legislation the Government
brings in. Present legislation expires in
1970 and will have to be replaced some
time next year.
It has been put around that Prime
Minister Gorton in Cabinet said it was
“damned ridiculous” that prices should
rise sharply with local supplies being
used and that he has called for a
major review of oil policy. So Senator
Gair may get some satisfaction without
having to throw his weight around.
Roads
Spending the money where it's needed
PRESSURE IS building up for aboli-
tion of the 40 percent clause in the
Commonwealth States Roads Agree-
ment. This provides that almost half
Commonwealth money must be spent
on minor rural roads.
Commonwealth Treasury has long
felt this is a purely political measure
which prevents the money from going
where it is most needed. The Com-
monwealth Bureau of Roads is against
it and so are most State road authori-
ties. The Chambers of Commerce of
Australia joined forces last week with a
formidable set of arguments of their
own.
The next five-year stage of the Com-
monwealth Aid Road Program is due
for review before July, 1969, and the
Commonwealth should seek to inspire
a new approach to Australia’s road
problems before then. The State Gov-
ernments in turn must examine their
own positions to see what greater
assistance can be given in helping to
overcome the problems of major city
roads.
As a means of tackling the problems,
the Associated Chambers of Commerce
are unanimously of the view that the
provision for mandate expenditure of
40 percent on rural roads should be
deleted from the Commonwealth Aid
Roads Act and that State Governments
should make a substantial allocation
from their total resources for the carry-
ing out of road development in their
major cities.
Even though Australia has one of the
highest ratios of road mileage to popu-
lation, a lower proportion of gross
national product is devoted to roads
than in some other advanced countries.
The National Association of Australian
State Road Authorities has estimated
that Australia’s total road needs for the
period 1969-74 would be $4170 million
and would exceed estimated available
revenues by $1468 million. On these
figures there is a costly gap to be
filled before Australia’s roads expendi-
tures can be considered adequate. The
costs of not filling the gap are the
growing death toll on the roads and
delays in road transport, particularly in
and around metropolitan areas.
It is not a problem that will be
solved quickly, even once a determined
attack is mounted. In the meantime, it
is a matter of tackling the problem


where it is most acute, namely, in our
major cities. In a young developing
country the casual observer might be
forgiven for seeing road needs in terms
of new tracks into the hinterland or
connecting links between new centres
of population springing up in fast
succession.
The stark fact is that in Australia
today the really desperate road problem
is within our major cities. The Lord
Mayors of the six capital cities have,
on 'behalf of all metropolitan muni-
cipalities, already put forward strong
submissions for urgent assistance for
road development in metropolitan areas.
These representations have had the
wholehearted support of Chambers of
Commerce and other organisations, but
so far the State and Federal Govern-
ments have not been persuaded to take
specific action to deal with the crisis in
metropolitan roads.
Foreign trade
Chinese cheats
THE BULLETIN reported last week
that the Indian delegation led by Prime
Minister Mrs. Gandhi complained about
dumped Chinese manufacture cutting
them out of the Australian market.
This week the Tariff Board reported
that in one area the Chinese are indeed
cheating—interestingly the first example
of Chinese trade malpractices. The
Board reported: “Although it found no
instance where the export price was
below the current domestic value
declared on the invoice, charges
enumerated on these invoices for items
such as overseas freight, cartage to
docks, labor in packing the goods into
outside packages, and value of outside
packages lead the Board to conclude
that if dumping is not taking place,
then serious irregularities are occurring
in invoicing goods from mainland
China.”
For example, the Board’s analysis
showed that in the case of Chinese
exports these charges represent a signifi-
cantly higher proportion of the C and
F price than on low-cost imports from
other sources. During the period re-
viewed the proportion overseas freight
bore to the G and F price ranged
between 10 and 50 percent and was
30 percent on average (weighted).
The Board acknowledges that some
variations in these proportions could be
expected for a number of reasons, but
it cannot accept, for example, that there
should be significant variations for
identical items shipped from the same
port at about the same time. These
variations were as wide as 15 percent
of the G and F price.
The Board found even wider varia-
tions in the proportion that the value of
outside packages bore to the current
domestic value of identical goods. This
has significance in assessing the value of
duty and the amount of duty levied.
MEN AND MATTERS
IT IS NOT too often that the Australian
Institute of Metals presents its highest
award a medal made, appropriately
enough, of silver, which is one of the
few metals able to nudge nickel out of
the headlines these days. But this year
the award has been made, and a metal-
lurgist (a breed much in demand in
Australia at present) won it.
The presentation was made at New-
castle, but the man getting the medal
was from Melbourne, Dr. Robert
Gifkins, the Senior Principal Research
Scientist of the Physical Metallurgical
Section of CSIRO, a title which seems
to put him on a stratospheric perch
miles above the madding crowds of
speculators in mining shares —and prac-
tically everybody else.
Dr. Gifkins, who lives at Nunawading
with his family, came here about
twenty years ago from Britain, where
he is, naturally, a Fellow of the
Institute of Metallurgy. He got his
Doctorate of Science from Melbourne
University, in 1961, for original
research. In 1962, the Royal School
of Mines, in Britain, invited him to
spend a year at Imperial College as
a research fellow, when he specialised
in the field of grain boundary cavitation
in nuclear reactor materials, where he
has made notable research contribu-
tions.
The opportunities, challenges, and
difficulties confronting younger metal-
lurgists in both academic and industrial
spheres have always claimed Dr.
Gifkins’ attention. The benefits of his
imaginative, constructive help and his
wise guidance are now warmly acknow-
ledged by many members of the profes-
sion both in Australia and some overseas
countries.
The establishment and development
of the “Journal of the Australia
Institute of Metals” has been largely
due to Dr. Gifkins. He played a
leading part in the activities that led
to the foundation of the “Journal.”
At the outset (in 1955), he was
appointed chairman of the Federal
Editorial Executive and has held this
position with great distinction ever
since, except when absent overseas.
THE OFFICIAL OPENING of the $2
million research laboratories at Thorn-
leigh, a northern Sydney suburb, for
Riker Laboratories Australia Pty. Ltd.
marks a milestone for Richard J. Preiss,
the Australian chairman and managing
director, who established the Riker
organisation in Australia exactly ten
years ago.
The laboratories were originally
billed to cost $500,000 and to be
finished by June of last year. The size
of the buildings was not revised, but
there was a larger investment in equip-
ment to provide a more complete func-
tion than originally envisaged. Now,
for the first time in Australia, privately
financed research will be carried out
into all fields of pharmaceutics and
pharmacology.
Internationally speaking, Riker’s busi-
ness is prescription drugs and medicines,
including major developments in drugs
to lower blood pressure, for the suppres-
sion of appetites, and for the relief of
coronary, asthmatic, and allergic condi-
tions. But in Australia the main
activity, at least initially, will be on the
central nervous system, researching
drugs for mental diseases.
Mr. Preiss is a graduate in pharma-
cology from Adelaide University. After
a few years with the Army in a South
Australian base hospital during the war,
he worked with May and Baker Ltd.,
the English drug company, for 12 years,
and became the N.S.W. and Queensland
manager. In 1958 came Riker Labora-
tories, an offspring of the American
Rexall Drug and Chemical Co., one of
the top 100 U.S. companies in size.
Though a slow talker in the fast-
Richard Preiss, slow but persuasive
talking world of American business,
Preiss was eventually able to persuade
his American parent to establish an
Australian laboratory rather than ex-
pand further their already huge labs
overseas. The group had come to the
conclusion that for best results the
optimum size for research laboratories
is 150 people, rather than the 1000 or
more that some U.S. companies now
have.
In all, Preiss has accumulated a staff
of 200 for the Riker organisation, but
this includes the subsidiary, manufac-
turing chemist R. D. Toppin and Sons
Pty. Ltd., of which he is also chairman
and managing director. This firm
makes proprietary medicines, including
a multi-vitamin and mineral tablet, and
does contract manufacturing for hos-
pitals. On the staff of the new research
unit there are at present 51 university
graduates, of whom four have been
lured back to this country in a reverse
brain-drain exercise.
Born near Clare, S.A., 48 years ago,
the son of a wheatfarmer, Preiss’ real
love is the land. He. commutes week-
ends with his family from Castlecrag
to a cattle farm at Mittagong, which he
happily acquired from his in-laws.

The Croesus Touch
ATTEMPTS TO RESTORE
SOME GLITTER
TO THE GOLD COAST
BY J. C. HORSFALL
THE TRUTH about the business
health of the Gold Coast, freely ad-
mitted by most of the commercial
people from Southport to Coolan-
gatta, is that it is pretty sick. A great
reappraisal of the future of the strip
and its place in the economy and
more particular in the Australian
tourist industry has been going on
for some time. Maybe as your
aircraft drifts down to it your thoughts
will be of bikinis, or perhaps Stanley
Korman (now wintering in Israel), but
for the permanent residents below, with
loads of money in the place, today’s
overriding thought is about when the
golden days of profitable prosperity are
coming back. Whether they be hoteliers,
shopkeepers, real-estate agents, sub-
dividers, amusement-place proprietors,
meter maids, hire-car people, or aircraft
operators, travel agents, or simply in
the ranks of the underemployed.
Looking at the affair in the hardest
business light, unblinded by the Coast’s
glittering natural and man-made attrac-
tions, the 40 percent drop in commer-
cial turnovers there last year is not
something the permanent residents, the
promoters, and the outside investors
who’ve sunk their money in the giant
enterprise can shrug off any more than
could BHP (with which it compares in
economic size) if the demand for steel
dropped by that much in a single
year. Nor is it just that last year’s
eclipse of business on the Coast is
necessarily a once-and-for-all affair.
This year the slump is continuing.
No punches have been pulled by the
local Tourist Development Association
in its efforts to get to the root of the
recession. Unlike some of the local
dignitaries I talked with whose infec-
tious optimism appears to be running
away with them, its diagnosis is pretty
realistic, though perhaps with it also
the next golden horizon looms rather
closer than it may prove to be. It gives
the facts of the recession unadorned.
Last year there was a drop of at
least 15 percent from the 1966 level of
572,000 visitors to the Gold Coast.
Allowing for annual growth rate in
recent years of 12 percent, air traffic
was down by about a quarter and by an
actual figure of 14 percent; the number
of coach arrivals fell by 25 percent;
businessess providing basic essential
monopoly services and so unaffected by
competition in their fields suffered a
40 percent drop in receipts. As for this
year, the Association says, “If anything,
the position has further deteriorated.” .
Why has this happened? Five basic
reasons are preferred by the Associa-
tion. In the first place there was the
cyclone of about this time last year
(the first big one since 1954 when the
Coast had barely arrived as a national
tourist attraction) and the adverse
publicity it attracted. Then New Zea-
land currency restrictions struck at the
Coast’s main source of overseas visitors
(devaluation of the N.Z. dollar would
now have made holidaying there nearly
20 percent more costly since last
November). On top of that the Israel-
Egypt flare-up deterred a lot of Jewish
people going to Surfers, a happy hunt-
ing ground of theirs (in fact, the
Association calls them “the backbone”
of the Coast’s winter trade). Lastly it
attributes a significant part of the
decline to general economic conditions
and the drought.
As well as all these difficulties the
Association admits that in the past two
years there has been “a vast expansion”
of accommodation, shop, and other
facilities, so that more and more busi-
nesses on the Coast are trying to live
off fewer customers. To make matters
worse, much of this development was
never soundly based but rather founded
on quite fictitious figures of the Coast’s
tourist potential. In consequence, it is
looking for a breathing space of three
years in which tourist growth can catch
up with the supply of facilities.
The essence of the economic exercise
now is to promote the product and get
the tourists flocking back in increasing
numbers. The fact that the revenue of
this sunshine business has suffered
heavily is not deterring it from massive
expenditure in the task. For instance,
the Gold Coast Council has borrowed
$3 l million to build a wall along the
sea front to prevent a repetition of
last year’s disastrous erosion, and to
restore the beaches. This has just about
been completed.
One can think of many indelible
question marks over the future of the
Gold Coast in Australia’s economic
scheme of things, questions ranging
from its place as an earner of overseas
exchange from the promotion of it
overseas (of which there has been
very little thus far, except in close
neighboring countries) to questions
about its own general economic direc-
tion, whether the best possibilities lie
exclusively in tourism development or
otherwise, such as a services industry,
or light secondary industry centre.
Even if it is bending over back-
wards to restore itself to its former
place in the tourist sun, the present
Gold Coast appears to be in a mood
for diversification in its economic
affairs, a reaction perhaps to the cur-
rent malaise it’s suffering from in its
tourist activities. On a cold analysis,
tourism looks by far its best economic
bet. It is far too isolated from big
markets and sources of manufacturing
supplies, and is without rail (the rail
line to Brisbane was ripped up in
1963), or harbor connections to make
much of a success of light industry
on any scale, though admittedly it is
doing something in building equip-
ment and the rather exotic manu-
facturing lines of skis, boomerangs,
wetsuits, lifejackets, and the like.

BRIEFLY
The economy : The ANZ’s monthly bulletin declared the
economy still sound, and the April downturn in capital
inflow was expected to be brief. Gross national product
may rise in real terms by 8 to 10 percent in 1968-69
compared with 5 percent this financial year.
Minister for National Development D. E. Fairbairn told
Parliament Esso-BHP would be exporting one million
tons of liquefied petroleum gas.
The 10 percent tax rebate for bond interest may not
stand, if Treasurer McMahon’s remarks are read right. Our
Treasurer told the English “Guardian” newspaper that
Australia would not make any sudden or large switch out
of sterling into other currencies or gold, nor will it
deliberately run down sterling balances.
A Senate Select Committee unanimously recommended
that Australia adopt metric weights and measures.
The markets: On Australian sharemarkets, big news of
the week was Anaconda-CRA-New BH’s nickel
find of values up to 11 percent at Higginsville, W.A.,
which projected New BH to $24 and CRA to $23.50
although these were subsequently corrected to finish the
week at $l6 and $lB.BO respectively.
The market was in a reckless gambling mood, with
speculators chasing the fringe nickel stocks for the best
proportionate profits. WMC was largely neglected, but
Timor hit $1.95 and finished the week 18c higher, on the
strength of nickel prospects, and Acmex, the holder of leases
south of the Anaconda strike, finished up $1.07 to
$3.63 . . . Latec hit 46c, the highpoint for 1968 on nickel
talk.
The week had opened with London taking an unpre-
cedented interest in Australian stocks, thanks to publicity
in “The Times” and the “Economist,” and also in the
“U.S. Oil and Gas Journal.” Among those sought,
Oil Search put on 38c to $1.38, Woodside 22c to $2.20,
and Ampol Ex. 45c to $3.95. The already heavily backed
favorite, BHP, added only 30c (to $23.70) for the week,
in response to Tuesday’s news of gas shows in Tuna A-l
at around 4300 feet, and the official report of hydrocarbon
shows (gas, not oil) beneath the gas field from which
Barracouta A-3 will be producing.
A. G. Healing moved up to 44c (from 26c) and Project
Development to $1.20 from last week’s level of 68c, both
without explanation.
The market in London was generally unsettled and,
although selling was light, buyers were reluctant and prices
drifted lower on most days. The increased U.K. credit
restrictions and the French crisis offset some good com-
pany statements. Australian mining shares continued
to sparkle, however, and by the end of the week gold
shares were brighter.
Wall Street ended the week on a brighter note, returning
from the Memorial Day holiday to stage an enthusiastic
reception for the latest step toward a tax-hike. The market
rallied on a broad front.
Companies: Prestige lifted profit from $1,058,000 to a
record $1,280,000 in the year to March, putting earning
rate at 30 percent. Reporting for the six months to April,
the British Tobacco group spoke of an encouraging increase
in profit. Firestone Australia incurred a loss of
$1,255,892 for the 16 months to October, the first
financial period under new control and reorganisation.
Profit in the year to June 30, 1966, was $19,946.
Reckitt and Colman said Big Sister Foods was only the
starting point for its expansion in Australia, now being
engineered by the reverse takeover of the food company.
Herbert Adams said it was not talking takeovers with
anyone.
Amalgamated Chemicals staged partial recovery in 1967
with a profit of $365,000 (8 percent on capital) but
paid no dividend, compared with the previous year’s interim
dividend only of 5 percent. Volkswagen Australasia has
cut its loss rate from $3,719,842 in 1966 to $2,614,304
and is planning for “operational profits” in the present year.
A dividend increase was announced by United Holdings;
interim was up from sto percent from profits for the
half to February.
ACI sold its bright steel operation to Martin Bright
Steels Ltd. for an undisclosed sum of cash. Martin Bright
will raise part of the price by a one-for-five issue at 20c
premium.
Everybody’s doing it . . . Bancor Pty. Ltd. offered $1.60
per share, or $l.BO in six weeks’ time, for 10 percent, then
20 percent of Vanderfield and Reid’s capital, on a first
come, first served basis, but this did‘not meet the directors*
approval. Tjuringa Securities made another first come,
first served bid for shares in Direct Acceptance, in an
attempt to wrest it from First Western Corporation. Mr.
Walter Shapowloff obtained more than 20 percent of
Talcott Factors by the same means, then made a 40c cash
offer for an unspecified number of 50c shares.
Mary Kathleen Uranium has intersected grades of
1.5 to 21b. of uranium oxide 800 feet below the present
opencut, but feasibility of exploitation may not be determined
for more than a year.
Vam paid $350,000 for a 75 percent interest in a turquoise
mine south of Hatches Creek in the Northern Terri-
tory . . . BHP dropped its Vam option for the Maryborough
nickel area in Queensland . . . but EZ is having another
look for nickel in the Zeehan area of Tasmania.
W.A. might soon be dubbed the nickel State; surface
indications of nickel (and copper) were found on privately
owned leases on the Pilbara goldfields. Norseman Gold
has pegged 21 mineral claims for beach sands in the
Busselton area of W.A.

Alcan adds ideas to
aluminium... and tough
Plank-flor saves
weight. Means more
profit. Every trip.
Starting out with a standard steei-and-timber carrying tray is
actually a handicap for a hardworking truck. It weighs too much.
Even a truck-tray only ten by seven feet weighs 9 cwt. If it's steel and
timber. An Alcan Plank-Flor tray, same size, weighs just cwt...
And Plank-Flor is tougher. Can't warp, rust or rot. Won't need
replacing. The Plank-Flor system is a series of high strength inter-
locking aluminium sections. It can help vans or trucks of any size to
carry more payload. And operators can save on registration, road
tax and general maintenance. Replace an old tray ... or start out with
Plank-Flor in your new vehicle. It's worth it.

Tactical Radio: A report from General Dynamics
In old suspense movies there always
seemed to be a sequence in which the
fleeing suspect tunes his car radio to the
police band, hears: “Car 64, fugitive
headed your way— intercept.” Where-
upon, suspect swings away and escapes.
Even today, by and large, if police
car A wants to reach squad car B one
mile away, willy-nilly, cars C, D, and
E, all tuned to the same channel, have
to listen too. And so can lots of unoffi-
cial ears.
This problem is compounded a thou-
sandfold by modern military tactical
requirements. Hundreds of squads, ve-
hicles, and individuals may be operating
separately over a wide area, all scram-
bled up with enemy units.
On occasion a commander must
broadcast orders to a hundred squads at
once. But he may also need to talk to a
single intelligence scout hidden hun-
dreds of miles away. Or an individual
unit may have to call another unit with
information or to call for support, with-
out hundreds of ears, friend or foe, all
automatically listening too.
Radio sets just that selective are now
being delivered or developed by General
Dynamics. Small and rugged enough to
go anywhere a man can go, and simple
to operate, the new radios are a key to
modem tactical mobility.
From 2 to 74,000:
World War II walkie-talkies had one or
two channels. The new sets have from
28,000 to 74,000 different channels for
voice or teletype communication. A gen-
eration ago, a mere 12 channels called
for a large fixed installation. Now one
with some 45,000 channels will be car-
ried on a man’s back. The biggest one
can fit the back seat of a jeep.
The enormous number of channels
permits direct “calling numbers” for
hundreds, even thousands, of other ra-
dios within sending and receiving range.
Each set, in fact, has a number of dif-
ferent calling numbers that can be
changed in prearranged groups every
day, every hour or in rapid sequence on
a moment’s notice to aid security.
The new combat radios are based pri-
marily on an old principle —single side-
band transmission. It took developments
of the past decade, however, in both
solid-state electronics and ultra-minia-
ture packaging to make practical such
sets for mobile ground use.
On an oscilloscope, an AM (ampli-
tude modulation) radio wave looks like
a single line. Actually that line is made
up of three distinct parts: a central car-
rier and two sidebands.
The central carrier is generated at a
specific frequency—in effect its “ad-
dress.” When modulated, (that is, the
message added) two sidebands come into
being to carry the actual information.
Both bear identical “intelligence.”
Less becomes more:
SSB techniques filter out the central
carrier and one redundant sideband.
The message is sent on the remaining
sideband, which contains all the essen-
tial information.
Only one-quarter of the power is now
required to send a signal the same dis-
tance. Alternatively, the same amount
of power needed for a full AM band
will send an SSB message at least four
times as far.
And with greater clarity.
“Noise” or static, comes from any
electrical interference—power lines, ve-
hicle engines, a storm 100 miles away.
The carrier section of standard AM is
particularly vulnerable. By using only
one sideband, two-thirds of the static
potential is avoided.
Radio tuning traditionally depended
upon quartz crystals, each of which vi-
brates at an individual wave length. With
enough of them, a large number of chan-
nels has always been theoretically possi-
ble. The number of fragile and expensive
crystals that could be carried in combat
was limited.
Today’s sets still use crystals but in
conjunction with electronic or electro-
mechanical oscillators and synthesizers
that can create thousands of different
rates of vibration—or separate channels
and can change from one to another
within fractions of a second.
Big becomes small:
New packaging techniques have been
equally important. For instance, big
tuning capacitors were originally the size
of a pair of clenched fists. Now their
function has been squeezed into a diode
the size of a match head. Sets in devel-
opment are only one-fiftieth the size and
weight of World War II sets that had
only a tiny fraction of today’s channels,
range or clarity.
Once upon a time there was room to
spare on our radio airways. Today, chan-
nels jam closer and closer; interference
has become a serious problem. General
Dynamics’ new sets are today filling
military needs. Future civilian applica-
tions, however, could double the num-
ber of channels available for voice or
data communication within the space
now taken up by AM transmissions.
New multi-thousand channel radios provide direct and clear communication among
hundreds of widely separated fighting units, each with many “calling-numbers”

Speculator’s Diary
AS CLOSE TO A
"CERT"
AS YOU CAN GET
TO MAKE MONEY in today’s oil and
mining markets you have to face the
facts. The facts are that shares are
effectively worth what they are selling
for. Their prices as always are based
purely on the age-old formula of
demand and supply. And at the
moment there is more demand than
there is supply. If you want to work
out intrinsic values—fine—it’s an inter-
esting (and sometimes amusing) exer-
cise, but unless you are willing to tem-
porarily disregard them don’t expect to
take home any profits. No doubt in
time, when supply finally catches up
with demand and when it becomes
obvious that many of today’s high fliers
are just not capable of fulfilling their
expectations, the intrinsic value will
come back into its own. However, until
then the only way to make profits is to
accept the fact that prices are some-
what out of control and make the best
of it.
One company in the oil sector that
does, in fact, seem to measure up intrin-
sically is the Papuan Apinaipi Petro-
leum Company. Under today’s market
conditions its price looks almost too
good to be true. It’s a company that’s
located right in the middle of the oil
lists, the go-go section of the market;
it’s a company that already has a
guaranteed income and which has got
extremely good prospects of increasing
that income quite substantially; and
it’s a company whose price still looks
relatively unravished.
Papuan Apinaipi on its natural gas
interests alone looks almost worth its
current price of 57 cents. The Asso-
ciated Group, in which Papuan
Apinaipi holds a 25 percent joint
Interest with Associated Continental
Petroleum, has already signed agree-
ments for the sale of 100,000 million
cubic feet over 15 years. The gas will
be pumped down from the company’s
leases on the Roma/Brisbane pipeline,
■which is* half-owned by Associated. A
leading Sydney broker who did a de-
tailed study of the stock reckons on
these figures alone, disregarding the
company’s other interests, Papuan
Apinaipi shares are worth a good 25
cents each. And as more contracts are
signed, and it seems inevitable that
they will be, the shares will be worth
even more. Associated has estimated
that sales of an additional 50,000 mil-
lion cubic feet alone could net the group
■double what it is now earning.
Exploration-wise the company is also
■of interest. What the shares are worth
on this basis is, however, anyone’s
guess. Although the company has a
currently active program of drilling, its
most excitfhg prospects from an oil
point of view are in the Bonaparte
Gulf area of Northern Territory—
where it has overriding royalty interests.
You might remember I mentioned this
area a few weeks ago in connection
with Alliance Oil Development as being
a geologically hot one. Offshore drill-
ing in the area in which Papuan
Apinaipi is interested is expected to
start early next year and it din be
reasonably expected that the company’s
shares will show a strong upwards
reaction as the actual spud-in time
draws closer. The company also has
royalty interests in the onshore Papuan
tenements adjoining Phillips Gulf—this
also has excellent prospects.
The most exciting side, however, of
the Papuan Apinaipi operation is its
coal. The company has massive coal
deposits in the Bowen Basin area of
Central Queensland which, if exploited,
and it looks almost certain they will
be, must make the company’s current
price look a steal. The company’s
last annual report revealed that at
Bluff, Queensland, drilling has estab-
lished reserves estimated at some 1000
million tons of high-quality coking coal
in seams ranging from 6ft. to 20ft.
thick at depths from 60ft. to 300 ft. At
Dingo North drilling had proved over
10 million tons of good quality anthra-
cite (the most expensive type of coal
available) at shallow depths that could
be recovered by open-cut mining.
The report then went on to say that,
the Associated Group and Thiess Bros,
had made a joint submission to the elec-
tricity authorities in Queensland for
the supply of steaming coal for a pos-
sible future power station at Theodore,
which would generate electricity for
Central and Southern Queensland.
Summing up, Papuan Apinaipi looks
a winner. It’s got gas going for it, it
has oil (or prospects of it) going for it,
and if its coal prospects are developed,
or if the contract for the coal supply to
Theodore power station is signed, the
company can very modestly expect that
its current share price will double or
better. I think this is one company that
under normal conditions would be a
good buy but which under today’s con-
ditions is as close to a “cert” as you can
get. I went all the way. I bought
5000.

Observe happy man on right.
He’s hooking dozens of
export sales.
One reason why Jack Alvey is a success-
ful exporter is that he goes out of his way
to demonstrate the advantages of his
product - overseas.
He’s manager of Charles Alvey & Son
Pty. Ltd; their famous product is the
Alvey side cast fishing reel. Regularly
Jack Alvey flies overseas, and takes
agents and buyers fishing. There, he can
convincingly demonstrate the advantages
of his fishing reel.
Result is, his English and American agents
are genuine Alvey reel fans - and now
they’re having trouble meeting demand!
The moral is: If you’ve got a good
product, it should sell anywhere in the
world. Just go out and sell it! Appoint
an agent. Take the trouble to show it,
explain it, demonstrate it. Keep it up.
The first bite could mean a big order.
Note: Exporting can increase your
turnover; can lower unit costs of your
product; can iron out seasonal fluctuations:
and can increase profits. Your company
will gain extra marketing knowledge,
and prestige.
The government helps you with:
Payroll tax, travel and promotion costs;
EPIC export insurance cover; Trade
Commissioner Services; promotion
publicity; and Department of Trade and
Industry facilities.

Why the boom keeps going
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
THERE IS one fundamental truth
about the mining boom that can never
be overstated; that is its ability to gen-
erate a continuing boom. A fortnight
ago when we forecast an “uneasy” time
for this week we did so because it
looked as if there were no really big
announcements imminent; after all,
WMC and BHP had put out their
sensations for the month. The facts
have shown otherwise; the Anaconda-
CRA-New BH nickel strike (at one
stage valued by the market at more
than the entire Western Mining Cor-
poration venture) has reminded the
market very forcefully indeed that the
fortunes being poured into mineral pros-
pecting right now are going to con-
tinue to turn up sensational news.
And booms feed on news (or the ex-
pectation of it). That is why the
massive drilling effort getting under way
this month in oil should provide sig-
nificant rewards to oil speculators; it
seems unlikely that all of the 30 wells
now going down or soon to do so will
not strike anything at all.
And the more drilling BHP does in
Bass Strait, the more good news it
seems to come up with. Last week’s
show of hydrocarbons in further drill-
ing below the Barracouta gas field
could end up having much more sig-
nificance than directors are prepared
to admit at present, and the Tuna well
also came up with some gas.
This oil-search boom is a sudden
change from the dull situation of last
month (just how dull last month was is
outlined in the article on Oil Drilling
and Exploration on page 57). But the
minerals search has been going on at
a steady clip for some time and it only
seems a matter of time before more of
the big leaguers, like BH South, which
is spending a lot of money, come out
with more good news. And then there
is always the chance that some of the
“roughies” might stumble over some-
thing, too.
All this does not change the .pros-
pect that, sooner or later, this boom
will go over the top, and that when
it does the reaction will probably be
more severe than it ought to be because
of the large number of technical in-
vestors in the market whose investment
decisions are influenced by such useful
devices as charts. On the other hand,
there is clearly a prospect that the
present dullness in the London market
could make Australia look even more
attractive to British eyes.
But even more important is the
growing awareness on the Continent
and in New York of the Australian
mining boom.
A COUPLE OF weeks ago we pointed
out, with our usual modesty, how well
the oil and mining stocks we selected
for 1968 had gone in the market so
far, and listed the successes of The
Chartist. As we pointed out then, it
has been hard to make mistakes in
selecting oil and mining stocks in
1968; our group would have returned
an almost 70 percent profit to those
who had invested an equal amount in
our seven recommendations. And this
was avoiding the risky, highly specu-
lative issues that have done so well.
But what is our record like in the
much more difficult industrial section
of the market, where there has been
no boom to carry everything along?
Our selections, heavily laced with re-
covery stocks, have done very well
indeed; an investor putting an equal
amount of cash on each of the 15
stocks we listed last December would
be showing a 25 percent profit by now.
This is the list:

On top of that, of course, there have
been the continuing suggestions made,
for example, in “Behind the Balance
Sheets.’ 5 All but one of the 12 stocks
recommended this year in this feature
have improved in price; some, like
John Martins, J. Fielding, R. W.
Miller, and A. G. Sims, rising by more
than 25 percent over only a few weeks.
And we are still hopeful that our one
laggard, Holden distributor Sydney
Holdings, will eventually come good
as GM-H solves its production problems
and gets increasing numbers of Holdens
on the road.

The Chartist says:
GREAT BOULDER GOLD MINES
was first recommended in November,
1967, when prices were about $11.50.
It was then suggested that an upward
target of about $24 would be possible
once the resistance level at $14.50 was
broken. However, buying power failed
to push prices through this level and a
major reaction followed and prices fell
to a low of $5.20 after the adjustment
for the issue. The stock now shows
promise of achieving the original pro-
jection adjusted to approximately
$22.50. There is the possibility of a
much higher target close to $4O but the
situation will require reassessment as
the trend develops. Last sale price on
30/5/68—510.10.


CLEAN vs. SMUT
It is a fact that ten years ago, before the emergence of the great Australian Aff-
luence, people and places really did look cleaner. Today, our beaches, highways, parks
and populace appear to be on the losing end of the battle for cleanliness. But not
our office buildings. Certainly not office buildings that are cleaned and cared for by
Crothall. They wage a battle against dust, dirt and grime that is never ending. And
they are winning. Crothall people, Crothall materials and the Crothall system of
cleaning is a combination that cannot be beaten. For premium quality cleaning service
at less cost, contact Crothall & Co. (We’re in the Pink Pages)

The Melbourne Market
Bricks have some
solid merits
NONE OF THE Melbourne-based
brick companies match the stature of
Brickworks Ltd. either in size or on an
investment plane, but recently they’ve
been as much in- the spotlight as the
N.S.W. giant. Two of them, Brick and
Pipe, the _ biggest in the State, and
Clifton Brick, have been running neck-
and-neck for the local brick accolade
of market favor and leaving the other
one, Glen Iris Brick, very much in the
lurch with their strong advances since
the beginning of the year. Both Brick
and Pipe and Clifton have beaten the
average market rise in industrials by a
big margin, while Glen Iris was a long
way under it. Brick and Pipe has come
up from 84c to $1.40 and back to $1.30
on profit taking after the bumper
result and lift from to 14 percent
in dividend. Clifton’s rise was from 98c
to $1.40, which was being held at the
end of last week despite an indication
from the company that, although sales
were up by 8 percent in the nine
months to March 31, profit for the full
year to June would probably be slightly
lower, largely because of cost increases.
Put alongside these two excellent
market performances, Glen Iris’
improvement of a bare 8 cents in the
past five months to 58c looks very
small beer.
Of course, observers shouldn’t neces-
sarily jump to the conclusion that
because Glen Iris’ shares have been
dragging their feet they are therefore a
good buy, that is taking the line that
they are bound to get in step with the
other two eventually. That doesn’t
follow at all, even if their yield is cur-
rently around percent, compared with
around 5| for Brick and Pipe and 5
for Clifton (Brickwork’s yield is much
lower at 3.4 percent). However, even
if there was nothing more to it than
that, Glen Iris could easily be given a
run by speculators who don’t seem all
that fussy what they buy these days.
Once on the scent they could easily
argue that the building trade is boom-
ing and some of it could be rubbing off
on the company despite its troubles. One
of the latter is misappropriation of
funds by one of the staff, which has
apparently been going on unnoticed for.
some years, according to the preliminary
report, which indicated inter alia that
the misappropriations had not affected
the lower profit of $116,511 (against
$135,334) for the latest year to
February 28 last, the amount so far
discovered, $85,508 relating to other
years.
The Minister of Local Government
has the Indian sign over the company’s
show at Oakleigh in the interests of
giving more ground to residents.
Against that, however, the company has
another kiln at Buln Buln, which
appears to be going strong, and all in
all the dividend record is pretty good.
Even with the reduced profit last year
the dividend was held at ten percent
and covered 1.8 times as compared with
only 1.7 for Brick and Pipe’s 14 percent
dividend and 2.1 for Clifton’s latest of
the same order (with a slightly lower
profit for the year to June 30 coming
up). So if speculators start chasing Glen
Iris they might not altogether be on the
wrong track. As for Clifton and Brick
and Pipe the yields on their shares seem
to be low enough, certainly in the case
of Clifton, for the time being at any
rate. On the long term both would
appear to have lock-away merits on
account of their propensity to expand
in a context of enlightened official
housing policies. (Clifton bought
Queensland Brick and Tile a few
months ago, which may well prove a
more paying proposition than Brick and
Pipe’s South Australian interests.)
THE BITS AND PIECES of Austra-
lian Factors will keep cropping up, and
possibly the receiver of the Victorian
bit which retains listed status, who has
been trying to get rid of it for two years
or more, is quite thankful that
nibblers continue to crop up as the
shares are hardly worth a song, except
for the company’s value for a back-door
entry to the lists and for the $1.2 mil-
lion tax losses, whatever these prove to
be worth: The key to the eventual fate
of the Victorian bit has been passed
from hand to hand in the form of a
controlling interest (there are about
2000 minority shareholders as well) and
now rests in the hands of Walter P.
Ham, a local stockbroking firm, who
last week seemed to be saying it didn’t
know what to do with it, because its
original plan to use the shell to house
and get a listing for another company
under its wing had not yet worked out
and may not do so. Depending on the
fortunes of this second company, Hams
would possibly put its controlling
interest in Factors into the market once
again. In the meantime, apparently,
another party is quite interested in get-
ting hold of it to squeeze the tax losses
out of it. Minority shareholders can
only hope that somewhere along the
line the part with the controlling
interest makes a respectable offer for
their holdings. What a dismal end to a
very dismal affair in which at one time
Australian United Corporation tuned in
to the extent of a million or so and
took a whacking loss for its trouble,
and in which other respectable brokers
closely identified themselves. But as the
weird going-on with T'alcott Factors
recently shows, there is still a role for
factoring here even if it hasn’t really
succeeded in getting more than a small
bite of the credit business offering in
Victoria, since Mr. Oswald Burt intro-
duced it ten years ago in company with
Stanley Korman, and Second Century
followed, only to come mightily
unstuck, also.

Behind the balance sheets
Boom times ahead for ODE
THE OIL drilling boom that starts this
month is good news not only for oil
speculators, it also means boom times
for oil drilling companies like Oil
Drilling and Exploration Ltd.,'"whose
drills have spent more time idle than
active in the past couple of years. And
as a little speculative sweetener there
is the chance that the burst of explora-
tory activity will turn up something
extra in the Mereenie area and so
upgrade the company’s important hold-
ings there.
But the main thing about ODE is
the cash it is going to make in 1968-69
out of drilling. Within the next six
weeks, ODE expects to have ten of its
11 rigs working simultaneously for the
first time. And, with luck, it may have
them all at work. This is a dramatic
change from the level of rigs used during
the past couple of years and indicates
the likelihood of a massive rise in earn-
ings next year from the current year’s
likely result (which promises to be signi-
ficantly better than last year’s poor
performance).
For average rig use in 1967-68 has
been better than in 1966-67, but still
well below capacity; for instance, last
week, one of the year’s worst, ODE
had only five of its 11 land rigs work-
ing. (All told, last week there were
20 land rigs idle in Australia and only
seven working, along with three floating
offshore rigs and three platform rigs.
One offshore drilling barge—owned by
an ODE associate company—was also
idle.)
Things were worse for oil drillers last
year when the average number of land
clrills working was 14.7 out of the total
of similar rigs then available of 38
(some have since left the country).
ODE felt this pinch as only 5.9 of its
rigs, on average, were in use and its
earnings crashed to only 8.5 percent on
capital.
One reason for the poor utilisation of
land rigs has been the success of off-
shore exploration, which has placed
heavier accent on offshore drilling than
before. To get a stake in this, ODE
has a 40 percent interest in Zapata-
ODE Offshore Pty. Ltd., which owns the
Investigator drill barge which drilled
the Golden Beach well in Gippsland
waters in March, 1967, and in the
current year drilled Ashmore for BOC.
It is currently lying idle in Darwin
harbor and could be there for some
time. But the increase in onshore
interest more than offsets this.
With much more work available and
with one month to go to the close of
ODE’s current financial year, it seems
that record results will be achieved and
1968 earning rate may be more like
1966’s 17.2 percent than 1967’s 8.5
percent.
In mid-March the company reported
net profit for the first half year was
slightly higher than the $314,000
achieved for the previous full year, and
therefore greatly in excess of the corres-
ponding half year. Depreciation charge
was higher and tax had ibeen provided,
although it had not been necessary in
the corresponding period of 1967-68.
To maintain satisfactory utilisation
rate of the drilling equipment, the com-
pany hopes always for long-term drilling
contracts. These are most likely to
come from drilling production wells
than exploratory wells. ODE has been
doing a fair amount of work for Wapet
in W.A.
The oil exploration industry is not
one geared to an annual growth
mechanism such as occurs in established
sections of the commercial world. But
the rate of oil exploration has increased
substantially since 1958-59 when the
Commonwealth Government first
announced its intention to subsidise and
grant direct financial assistance for oil
exploration. Since 1960, total expendi-
ture on oil exploration in Australia, and
New Guinea has multiplied from $15.7
million to $73.4 million in the 1966 year
to December. Of this the amount
spent by private enterprise has grown
from $12.5 million to $58.8 million.
The subsidy in 1966 was $10.2 million.
Expenditure for 1967 is not yet
known, but the number of wells drilled
in 1967 calendar year was 274, com-
pared with 134 in 1966, 209 in 1965,
and 26 in 1960. The year 1966 showed
a drop in number because many were
offshore, and a higher proportion were
deeper wells, which took longer to drill,
and, of course, were more expensive.
This trend continues.
Although there were more jobs going
in 1967-68, many were delayed by rain,
so ODE’s actual drilling activity in the
current year may, after all, be compar-
able to 1966-67.
The prospect of revision in 1970 of
the Government’s scheme of incentives
on local oil production is more likely
to speed up the rate of drilling activity
than otherwise in the interim period.
In fact, Wapet has accelerated its devel-
opment program on Barrow Island in
anticipation of changes, and other com-
panies with good prospects also would
be wise to hasten toward commercial
exploitation before the incentive is
scaled down. The drilling subsidy is re-
viewed from year to year on June 30,
and will undoubtedly continue regard-
less of what happens to incentives.
Since the Government began paying
subsidies for oil exploration, ODE
decided to stimulate drilling intensity
and an exploration subsidiary, Exoil
Pty. Ltd., was formed and applied for
lease areas over the Eucla and Officer
basins in S.A. and W.A. This company
was floated as Exoil N.L. in 1962, and

What is Lytespan?
Basically, Lytespan* is an electrified
track designed to support and supply
lighting equipment in a flexible manner.
It is the fastest and least expensive
way of installing multi-point lighting
with infinite flexibility. One Lytespan
circuit can supply power for up to 48
100 W. incandescent lamps. Special
adaptors make it simple to establish
connections for all sorts of lighting fit-,
ings of varied wattages anywhere along
the track. Fittings can be slid along
the length of the track, clipped on or
off as required, and fittings not in use
can be stored on the track. Neither
skilled tradesmen nor special tools
are required.
What are Lytespots?
Lytespots are a complete range of dis-
play lighting designed for use with
Lytespan, offering a wide range of
intensities and variety of beam spread,
throw, pattern and shape. With these
Lytespot fittings, on Lytespan track,
light can be tailored precisely to the
job in hand, changed quickly and
simply at will.
How Lytespan benefits you
Lytespan is the fastest and cheapest
way to install multi-point flexible light-
ing. It’s also the most versatile system.
Let Lytespan put you on the right track.

ODE had a shareholding. At last bal-
ance date it held 300,000 50c vendors’
shares (unlisted) and 84,600 shares paid
to 30c. The contributing shares were
then well below paid-up value, but in
recent months Exoil shares have moved
up strongly.
ODE sold all its Exoil shares includ-
ing vendors’ shares more than a month
ago and would have netted a capital
profit, but not as much as the current
market would afford.
/ Through its subsidiary, Krewliff
Investments Pty. Ltd., ODE retains
direct interest in oil exploration. Krew-
liff has a 13J percent interest in certain
areas of permits 43 and 56 in the
Northern Territory, which includes the
Mereenie field and which, after recoup-
ment of certain costs, drops to a per-
cent undivided working interest.
Drilling of seven wells in the
Mereenie area, 140 miles south-west of
Alice Springs, by Exoil-Magellan,'
revealed 300 to 500 million barrels of
oil and large reserves of natural gas.
East Mereenie No. 1 flowed gas at the
rate of 30 million cubic feet a day, and
No. 4 flowed oil at the rate of from
160-350 barrels a day. Commercial
exploitation has been delayed by isola-
tion and the tightness of the reservoir
rocks, but consideration is being given
to the possibility of using nuclear explo-
sions to free oil trapped in tight rock
formations. Meantime a gas pipeline
to Alice Springs is being planned to
exploit a small portion of the vast gas
reserves.
Magellan is spudding in another hole
in North West Mereenie in mid-1968
in an attempt to prove further reserves
to justify exploitation. If the Mereenie
field reaches commercial exploitation,
Krewliff’s interest could be of consider-
able value.
The company acts as drilling contrac-
tors from three locations, Alice Springs,
Toowoomba, and Perth, hiring out plant
and personnel.
In 1964-65 the company became
associated with H. C. Price of Okla-
homa, experts in pipeline construction,
but so far there have been no joint
operations.
In February, 1966, Zapata-ODE Pty.
Ltd. was incorporated, with ODE taking
40 percent and Zapata Offshore Co. of
Houston, Texas, taking 60 percent of
the issued capital. Zapata is a leading
contractor in offshore drilling in the
Gulf of Mexico. Investigator was built
in Newcastle and commissioned in
February, 1967, a floating drilling vessel
capable of drilling in 300 feet of water.
ODE’s share investment was only $2,
but ODE had lent the associate $400,000
in an unsecured loan and provided
$196,000 long-term trade credit facilities
in the year to June, 1967. Because of
the necessity for loan repayments, some
considerable time will elapse before
ODE shareholders receive any benefits
from this venture (Investigator repre-
sents an investment of $4 million), and
the fact that it has only done two jobs
in 15 months, and is now idle as off-
shore searchers prefer other types of rig,
puts the rewards further off than antici-
pated.
The company is interested in pro-
viding ancillary services to the oil
industry, and during 1966-67 Zapata
Offshore Co. and ODE, in conjunction
with the boatbuilders Lars Halvorsen
Sons Pty. Ltd., formed the company
Zapata-Halvorsen Pty. Ltd. to provide
service boats to the offshore oil industry.
The Attunga crew boat was launched
in January, 1967, and earned income
from April, 1967. ODE’s interest in this
is 26 2-3rd percent.
In the two years ending June, 1966,
$4.6 million was spent on six rigs,
bringing the score to 11. This sub-
stantial expenditure was financed by
placement of one million shares in April,
1965, at 70c with Australian financial
companies by a one-for-five issue of the
35c shares at 55c in April, 1966, the
placement of 700,000 shares at 62-|c
with institutions in July, 1966, and some
accommodation from the bank. In
1966-67, $284,000 was borrowed in
secured bank advances, as well as the
normal "overdraft, down from $1.4
million to $774,000.
Only other capital moves for share-
holders, since the company’s formation
in 1954, were the capital reductions
bringing par value of the shares down
from 5/- to 3/4, then written up in
November, 1965, to 3/6 by a 2d bonus,
so that the shares could be traded as
35c paid on decimal conversion, and
there was a one-for-four par issue in
July, 1963. In November, 1966, instead
of a 10 percent cash dividend, which
would have strained liquidity unduly,
the company made a one-for-ten bonus
issue of shares.
Liquidity having improved since, a
cash dividend of at least 10 percent is
assured by the 2c cash interim, and
directors’ promise that “subject to any
extraneous events directors are confident
a dividend of not less than l£c per
share will be declared in October, 1968”
on the 35c units.
A price near 60c would be more
reasonable for these shares, now around
50c, if earning rate of around 20 percent
is attained for the year shortly to con-
clude. And its bright prospects suggest
that further rises should follow. In addi-
tion, it has a stake in exploration and
so carries some speculative appeal. But
the short-term downside risk at present
price looks small (although the Zapata-
ODE associate has problems) and there
seems every likelihood of some price
appreciation bv September, when the
1968 results will be published.

Security analysis
Tyree’s transformation
TYREE INDUSTRIES LIMITED has
brought off the biggest coup in the
Australian electrical industry with the
rationalisation of a great chunk of the
power and distribution transformer-
manufacturing business in this country.
For the cost of $3 million in cash, Tyree
has just purchased the transformer-
manufacturing department of the
British-owned GEC-AEI group in Aus-
tralia. With its existing own large
operation in transformers, the integra-
tion will bring into the Tyree camp
control of around 70 percent of the
productive capacity in Australia for
manufacturing power and distribution
transformers. With an annual market
growth in the industry of about 8 per-
cent, there is a lot of profit which can
be earned with the right know-how.
Electric transformers are used to
minimise the cost of distributing power
over long distances and are used to
increase or decrease the voltage with
very little loss in energy.
Their size is expressed in capacity
(i.e., kilovolt amperes) and the volt-
age of the high-tension winding. There
is an ever-increasing tendency on the
part of electrical-supply authorities to
require transformers with a much
higher voltage and kVA rating than
ever before.
The larger units are more economical
for the supply authorities, for as their
electrical system develops and their
load grows they tend to use large
transformers in order to avoid having
a multiplicity of smaller sub-stations.
In the U.S.A., transformers of 400MVA
at 500kV (that is, 400 million volt-
amperes at 500,000 volts) are now being
installed, and in Australia units as large
as 585MVA at 330kV for the New
South Wales system and 200MVA at
500kV for Victoria are planned for
installation by 1969. At a rough estimate
of $1 per kVA, these units could cost
up to $585,000 each and weigh up to
300 tons.
The total power and distribution
transformer business in Australia is
worth in the vicinity of $20-25 million
a year, but, on a dollar turnover volume,
about 50 percent of the market is
restricted to the supply of transformers
above 75kV. The greatest profit
potential is in the supply of these larger
units. There are about 11 manu-
facturers in Australia, sharing possibly
60 percent of the market, and imports
make up the balance, but this tends to
obscure the economics of the industry,
where currently imports are making up
about 50 percent of the market above
75kV.
The electricity-supply authorities in
Australia, who are the customers for
transformers, are still a little wary
about the ability of the Australian
companies to supply the very large units
with the same degree of familiarity
and the same degree of efficiency as
the overseas companies because of
their more limited experience in pro-
ducing units . beyond 120MVA at
132kV and 100MVA at 220kV. Tyree’s
orders far exceed this capacity. In
actual fact they are shortly to com-
mence 180MVA at 300kV and then
their new works, presently being built,
will be producing the first contract
ever placed by the Snowy Mountains
Hydro Electric Authority for trans-
formers manufactured in Australia.
These transformers are for the Murray
2 Power Station and will make up a
bank of 528MVA at 330kV, being the
largest that will be used in Australia
for some considerable time.
The far-sighted Australian trans-
former manufacturer who wants to get
into the big league must plan about
five years ahead from the time he de-
cides to produce transformers with
higher voltages and higher ratings in
order to provide the facilities to tender,
receive orders, and execute these orders.
This involves not only a substantial
plant capacity and extensive training
of engineers to build the units but also
involves expensive test equipment to
provide works tests. My information is
that Tyree Industries is becoming the
major force in the industry and will
increasingly expand its share of the
market. It is the company which has
brought most of the technical innova-
tions to the Australian industry within
the past decade and the company now
has only one major competitor in the
Australian end of the business.
The integration of the GEC-AEI
transformer business with Tyree gives
this company the means to secure up
to 60 percent of the market at present
won by Australian companies. This
estimate excludes a further 10 percent
of the market held by the locals, which
is in the possession of Westralian Trans-
formers in Perth, a company in which
the Tyree family holds a large personal
investment and in which Tyree Indus-
tries Limited provides technical know-
how and managerial assistance in re-
turn for a substantial annual royalty.
Tyree is now after the lucrative
' business for the very heavy trans-
formers, so far a virtually untapped
market to the local Australian pro-
ducer, which is worth about $5-6
million a year.
The strengths of Tyree are in its
graduate engineers, who have been ex-
tensively trained both in the company’s
own design offices and factories and in
the laboratories, factories, and design
offices of its overseas technical advisers,
Westinghouse Electric Co., U.S.A., and
also with the French Westinghouse
licensee, Jeumont Schneider, with which
the company also has direct technical
know-how affiliations. Before the merger
with the GEC-AEI transformer depart-
ment, Tyree had 50 graduate engineers
(including the staff of its affiliate,
Westralian Transformers) in a total
workforce of 580. Tyree now inherits
a workforce of 400 from GEC-AEI,
trimmed down from 550, which includes
a team of 12 graduate engineers. The
new group, with a total employment
of almost 1000, now operates a total of
11 factories six in Sydney, two in
Melbourne, and one each in Brisbane,
Adelaide, and Auckland (N.Z.), while
the affiliate, Westralian Transformers,
is the sole producer of transformers in
the West.
The intention is to re-house the six
Sydney factories in a new complex at
Liverpool, near Sydney, which will be
occupied in progressive stages up to
1971, where it will eventually employ
up to 700 people. The first tenant at
the new Liverpool factory will be
Endurance Electric, which Tyree
acquired from the W. R. Carpenter
group in February, 1968. Endurance
Electric produces an intensive range of
small transformers used in appliances,
together with current transformers and
capacitors. The major advantages of
the rationalisation will come not only
from the increased buying power ad-
vantages in raw material purchases but
also from the concentration of manu-
facturing facilities in the various Tyree
factories to produce transformers most
suited to the needs of specific locations.
Transformers are very heavy units to
transport from the factory to the site,
as an individual unit can weigh several
hundred tons. Transport charges are
therefore a major item in escalating
the costs of production and can add
up to 10 percent to the final cost.

and 1 for 10 in both 1965 and 1966, the
latter two being in lieu of a cash
dividend. To help finance the acquisi-
tion of the Australian transformer
business of the GEC-AEI group, the
company is making a 1 for 4 issue at

At $2.50 the shares have a dividend
yield of 3 percent and the price earn-
ings ratio is 10.9. Although the current
dividend yield is small, I would recom-
mend the stock for its outstanding
growth potential.

Hope for Ardlethan’s prospects
THE RISE IN the price of shares in
Ardlethan Tin NL over the past month
or two has certainly been justified by
the announcement last week that the
company would be selling all its tin
concentrate to Japan. For the announce-
ment indicated that the company is now
confident that it can produce at a rate
of around 800 tons of tin metal (in Con-
centrate form). This is a considerable
improvement over the 626 tons it pro-
duced last year and seems to show that
the problems of recovery which had
previously been encountered have now
been successfully overcome. The
company’s half yearly report on opera-
tions to the end of December last
certainly indicated that things were on
the improve, but this appeared to be
the result of lower costs rather than
higher recovery rates. Although tin pro-
duction was virtually unchanged for
the first six months (rising from 323
tons to 329 tons), there was, in fact, a
considerable rise in profits. In place of
the loss of $26,000 incurred in the first
half of 1967 the company notched up a
profit of $61,000 a turn around of
$87,400. This improvement was due to
a combination of better grades, higher
recovery, lower interest-and-deprecia-
tion charges, and more favorable mar-
keting arrangements. The actual im-
provement was slightly better than these
figures show because the $26,000 loss
was after 25 weeks’ production, whereas
the profit earned for the first half of
the current year was after twenty four
weeks’ operations. In addition to this the
price of tin was lower in the six months
to last December than it was in the
first half of last year. When reporting
on results for the six months, Directors
said that there had been an “improved
stability” in recovery rates and since
then there appears to have been further
improvement.
The turn around in half-yearly profit
of $61,000 when added to last year’s
profit gives a figure of $138,000 for
a rough estimate of this year’s profit,
while if the combination of favorable
factors continues, and the second half
shows a similar rate of improvement,
profit for the full year may well exceed
this figure by a tangible margin.
The company itself has given the
nod to the higher figure by its declara-
tion of an interim dividend of 2-| cents,
as a full 5-cent-per-share dividend
would require earnings of at least
$196,300.
The announcement that the company
is to sell about 800 tons of tin per
annum, contained in concentrates, to
Rasa Industries of Japan shows con-
fidence that it can raise metal produc-
tion even higher than the 700 tons likely
to be produced this year (as against the
626 tons produced last year). This
higher production will, of course, mean
some increase in ore throughput. At
reserve grade and using a recovery
rate of 60 percent, which the company
says it is approaching, annual ore
throughput will be in the vicinity of
330,000 tons per year. Ore reserves
have been reduced by the past four
years’ operations from the 3,010,000
tons originally outlined in 1963 to
about two million tons last June, and
mining in the current year has reduced
this by a further 300,000 tons to give
a mine life of only some five to six
years at the output required by the
recently announced contract.
On this basis alone there would be
little justification for the 70 cents being
paid for the shares, even on the assump-
tion that dividends will continue. There
is, of course, the ever-present possi-
bility that a lift in the price of tin will
boost profits considerably, but the

abbreviated mine life must loom larger
as time passes, unless there is an
increase in ore reserves. It is just in
this area that there may be good
reason for the current strength of the
company’s shares. The market these
days is quite ready to forgive the lack
of earnings and dividends as long as it
is given the hope of success in explora-
tion programs; and, with the increasing
exploration activity which Ardlethan is
undertaking, its current valuation of the
company may not be so far astray.
The original reserves were established
at depths less than 150 feet, and it was
not until 1966 that any further drilling
was undertaken. Exploration since that
time has revealed several anomalies
both on existing leases as well as on
leases held by the company under
option, and in particular encouraging
results were obtained from drilling on
the edge of the White Crystal orebody.
Holes previously drilled to about 150
feet on this deposit contained evidence
of mineralisation of copper, and further
drilling has been made to test the
quantity of ore at depth for both tin
and copper.
The company has had ample evidence
that its orebody contains minerals other
than tin—its difficulties in achieving a
satisfactory recovery rate have in large
part been due to tangible quantities of
lead, zinc, and copper minerals, parti-
cularly lead sulphide.
LAST WEEK’S article on Western
Titanium contained a fairly glaring
error. The annual commitment under
the company’s contract with Laporte
Titanium (Australia) Ltd.—a million
tons of ilmenite over 20 years—is
50,000 tons per year, not 500,000 tons
as was suggested. This means that the
company cannot look forward to
doubling its capacity on account of this
contract, and hence will not have
capital expenditure from such an
Increase to offset against taxation liabili-
ties. Offsetting this there will prob-
ably be a need to increase capacity,
anyway, due to the demand for bene-
iiciated ilmenite—it will take more than
H tQ ns of ilmenite to produce a ton of
beneficiated ilmenite, and there will
still be a demand for ordinary ilmenite
for quite a few years after beneficiation
becomes a reality.
ALTHOUGH Project Development
lias been caught up in nickel frenzies
before, rumors that had been building
up all week culminated on Friday in a
massive and unprecedented surge to
$1.20 from 78c.
The company is understood to be
actively prospecting on its leases in
Western Australia.
One of these leases is in the same
area where earlier on in the week
indication's of nickel were reported.
Another lease is in the Southern
Cross area, the scene of much cur-
rently feverish activity.

THE LAND
N.Z.'s hopes for rural industries
IT IS literally true that if devaluation
last November didn’t have to save the
income structure of New Zealand’s rural
industries, it has come, to the rescue
of the Government’s finances which pre-
devaluation and the earlier scrapping
of consumer subsidies played such a
decisive role in supporting. The canker
there in the last year or two has been
the nation’s woolgrowers, who have
watched world prices of crossbred wool
crumble before their eyes without too
much thought that their incomes would
do likewise; at least until the N.Z.
Wool Commission would be forced to
bow to the inevitable and, to the great
relief of the Government, cut the re-
serve price to something more in line
with the realities of the world market.
Devaluation has, in effect, greatly
reduced the burden on the N.Z.
Government of holding up farm
incomes, particularly for wool for
which the world price had for some
time before devaluation made income
support a costly business. Unfortunately,
though, with the continuing weakness
in world demand for crossbred wool,
especially of the poorer qualities, the
country’s balance of payments has
gained little if anything from wool on
account of the depreciated value of
the N.Z. dollar. Nor has it gained very
much from dairy produce exported
mainly to the U.K., which, of course,
also devalued, though not to the same
extent as the N.Z. dollar. With meat,
it is a bit different, because the demand
in the main markets, the U.K. and the
U.S.A., is rather more elastic. In the
U.K., N.Z. has also been gaining from
the ban on imports of meat from
Argentina, and in the U.S.A. its price
advantage has been helped in that
devaluation against the dollar has given
it a full 19.4 percent edge over
Australia.
In the circumstances, it is not the
rural industries which have contributed
the lion’s share to the improvement in
N.Z. balance of payments, which have
been restored to an even keel since
devaluation. The main effect has come
from a sharp reduction in imports by
making them so much more expensive
in N.Z. currency terms. Actually, it is
manufacturers rather than farmers who
have found the most new-export oppor-
tunities opening up to them since de-
valuation. .’
A recent report on N.Z., by a
special correspondent of the London
“Economist,” made the point that N.Z.
is likely to see considerably more pro-
cessing of raw materials and com-
modities, an idea which has been
pushed strongly in Australia in recent
years and with increasing success.
Facing up to where N.Z.’s economy
goes from its present “excessive
reliance” on wool and butter fats, the
“Economist’s” man concedes that N.Z.
does have “some” time to make the
necessary adjustments. As he sees it,
“Britain is not exactly catapulting into
the Common Market and until it does
N.Z.’s main export market remains
safe. But once Britain does get into
the EEC, New Zealanders themselves
realise, even without the recent
example of Kenya’s Asians, that it
would be unwise to rely excessively on
Westminster’s undertakings of special
guarantees. ‘The British Government
would sacrifice its own farmers, let
alone ours, to get into the Common
Market,’ is the common view among
Cabinet Ministers in Wellington. What
New Zealanders do place more hope
in are two main arguments.”
The first of these, he says, is: “The
arguments about the future of wool
prices, which have recently recovered
modestly from last year’s depths. Here,
New Zealanders claim that the syn-
thetics that compete with their coarse
wool are currently being produced at
a loss. True. But the price of producing
these synthetics is falling all the time
with improved manufacturing processes
and increasing economies of scale. In
that case, the New Zealanders go on to
argue, there will still be a market for
coarse wool in Eastern Europe and the
more affluent parts of the developing
world. But this sounds dubious because:
“(a) Despite an increase of New
Zealand wool exports to these countries,
there is no reason why they should not
buy Western synthetics in rising
quantities.
“(b) The Communist world will
inevitably develop its own growing and
increasingly viable synthetics industry
in time.
“(c) If some of New Zealand’s Latin-
American competitors like Uruguay and
Argentina should go in for larger-scale
coarse-wool production, they could
probably undercut and outsell New
Zealand in what coarse-wool markets
still remain.”
Second, there are the arguments
about the world market for butter and
cheese. Here it is fair to say that New
Zealanders are talking sense when they
say that it is ludicrous to drive them
out of business as the world’s most
economic butter producers, at around
£l5 a hundredweight, so that President
de Gaulle can subsidise his farmers into
producing a world glut at £35 a
hundredweight. But leading New
Zealand officials are in some cases
doubtful about the prospects of getting
a workable World Commodity Agree-
ment on dairy sales, although the
Dominion Government is still trying
very hard for one.
So the crucial point is that, in the
longer term, wool, mutton, lamb, and
dairy fats are all likely to play a less
important role in New Zealand’s
exports, even than some of New
Zealand’s more level-headed prognos-
ticators foresee.

Unfathomable expansions in nitrogen
FOR REASONS that are not at all
readily fathomable, industrialists are
rapidly expanding this country’s cap-
acity to manufacture nitrogen fertilisers.
Consumption has certainly been in-
creasing at a remarkable rate, although
lagging far behind the growth of the
factories. Five years ago farmers were
applying less than half as much as they
are now. In those days the horticultural
and sugar croppers accounted for almost
all the artificial nitrogen produced here
or imported. But the acreage under
these crops has increased only slightly.
Therefore, it would seem that cereal
growers are becoming important users.
Western Australia alone among the
States has wide areas of wheatlands
that will respond profitably to regular
dressings of nitrogen. But even there
nitrogen manufacture seems to have
headed down the wrong road. The big
plant at Kwinana, near Perth, produces
anhydrous ammonia, the most concen-
trated form of nitrogen fertiliser there
is. It contains 82 percent of nitrogen,
This compound is a gas, but under high
pressure becomes a liquid, and so for
ease of transport and handling is stored
in pressure cylinders. Special equipment
is needed to release it into the soil,
Nevertheless, the lowest rate of applica-
tion possible with this equipment ex-
ceeds 201 b. per acre. This is more than
many soils need for optimum wheat
yields. Besides, anhydrous ammonia is

one of the most expensive sources of
nitrogen.
To avoid serious losses the gas should
be injected deep into moist soil at seed-
ing time. Farmers, naturally, like to
start sowing as soon as the soil becomes
moist and so are tempted to postpone
the fertiliser until afterwards. But an
application of anhydrous ammonia only
about two weeks after sowing has been
found to depress yields by four bushels
per acre. On this occasion the agrono-
mists considered that the reduction was
caused by mechanical damage to the
plants. However, it is a well-established
fact that anhydrous ammonia, like any
other nitrogen fertiliser that releases
free ammonia, can poison seedlings.
Another worry with this particular
fertiliser is that it partly sterilises the
soil and hence reduces the population
of nitrofying bacteria.
Anhydrous ammonia also increases
the acidity of the soil, particularly at
depth. This can discourage root
development and penetration and en-
courage shallow root systems.
Back east, and speaking particularly
for the Victorian Department of Agri-
culture, Mr. J. McCann stated recently
that nitrogen fertiliser applied over a
period of years gives an economic
return only in certain limited situa-
tions. These he defined as Mallee sand-
hills, other very light soils, skeleton-
weed - infested land, and, in the
heavily cropped fallow-wheat land.
Since the old axiom is still some-
times true, “a pound of nitrogen is a
pound of nitrogen, regardless of its
source,” Mr. McCann quotes prices for
the various fertilisers in terms of their
nitrogen content. Per pound of nitrogen
they are: hrea 9 cents, ammonium
nitrate 10£ cents, anhydrous ammonia
12| cents, and ammonium sulphate 13
cents. These quotes include the subsidy.
Without it they would be almost 4 cents
higher. Now comes the question: who is
being helped by the subsidy? And who,
for that matter, advised Mr. McMahon
to grant it in the first place? Perhaps
he and the industrialists were motiva-
ted by humanitarianism and the hope
that the food-short countries would be
willing and able to pay for the balance
outstanding after the Australian tax-
payer had made his contribution.
India, for example, has fallen badly
behind on its fertiliser production plan.
That country’s use of nitrogen is insig-
nificant in relation to its need. Its
farmers apply only about 21b. of
nitrogen per acre of arable land com-
pared with Japan, which piles on a
whacking 1101 b. to feed her population
successfully. The United States produces
and consumes more nitrogen fertiliser
than any other nation. U.S. farmers pay
about 8 cents a pound for their nitrogen
and use it on about one-third of their
wheat acreage. Biggest users, apart from
the horticulturalists, are the corn and
cotton croppers. In Europe, where
farmers also can afford to use lots of
nitrogen, the price is about 6 cents a
pound. One thing is clear: our subsidy
has either gone too far or not far
enough.

Television
This Day Tonight in
Lewis Carroll-land
by DENIS O'BRIEN
SINCE the final episode of “At Last the
1948 Show” made such devastating fun
of the earnestness of so many television
current-affairs programs it has been
difficult to look at the ABC’s “This
Day Tonight” without feeling that one
or other of its hired experts is going
to poke out his tongue and flap his
ears at one of Michael Willesee’s par-
ticularly banal points of view. As
journalism, “TDT” has begun to seem
like a parody of itself, drifting closer
to that Lewis Carroll world of breath-
less righteousness and harmless lunacy,
so cleverly maintained by Sydney’s
afternoon newspapers (which are still
cheap at five cents).
Most of what is frustrating the pro-
gram’s early clear purpose stems from
its irritating dichotomy. Someone in the
ABC sees it as a cult with a fan
mail and “I Like Bill” buttons;
“TDT” seems to see itself as every-
body’s conscience. The result is now too
often a bland and undemanding variety
show posing self-importantly as
interpretative journalism. Its little
exposes and indignations bristle in self-
contained comfort alongside Brian
Joyce, puffing through yet another of
his athletic interviews (and still seem-
ing to be selling Raoul Merton shoes
for Graham Kennedy); its studied air
of political fearlessness (Willesee telling
us where Whitlam went wrong) likely
to be followed by some pop group with
nothing but Bill Peach’s heavily con-
trived introduction to excuse three
minutes of stupefying boredom.
The program sets out to give us
what the daily Press can’t, but too often
comes across as just another afternoon
paper dredging for news and stunts.
Striving for the topicality of its mast-
head frequently traps it into the trivial
follow-up; it is at its best these days
when long-sightedly this Week or this
Month tonight instead of hastily and
expediently this Day tonight.
Patrick Nilon’s recent careful sum-
mary on the effect of chainstore con-
sumer competitions on grocery prices
was a simple example of the program
using its opportunities to effective
advantage. The item had a useful
perspective which is rarely apparent in
the program’s attempt to supply back-
ground and interpretation to the
momentous issues of the day.
When it shapes up to tackle some
sudden shift in international politics, a
dramatic breakthrough in medicine, or
a new crisis in human survival, “TDT”
looks admirably impressive. One has a
sense of comforting anticipation that
the world’s complexities (which even
overwhelm James Dibble’s air of calm
sanity at the 7 p.m. newsdesk) are
about to be logically explained and put
in context. But in—hurrying to meet
its deadline “TDT” rushes to judgment
and adds to the confusion more often
than it acts as a useful interpreter. A
common fault is to attempt a sym-
posium on a subject such as the Ameri-
can presidential race, recruit two or
three contributing experts into the
Sydney studio, bring in another couple
from Melbourne or Canberra by
coaxial cable, and then limit the whole
Peter Luck ... compelling
thing by time and imprecise direction
to a babel of superficialities.
It’s on such occasions that “TDT’s”
earnestness tempts the satirical thought:
how wonderfully manic it would be if
that Canberra contributor, remote there
on the monitor screen, began competing
against his isolation from the argument
in Sydney by undressing to beckon
attention.
Although it never seems to have
trouble hiring expert opinion from the
universities (academics always appear
to preen in the “This Day Tonight” en-
vironment), it’s a pity that the program
has no specialist experts of its own.
Frank Bennett offers the best substitute
with his substantial commonsense and
maturity. Peter Luck has a compelling
manner, knows how to let a fool or a
bigot hang himself, and measures his
thoughts against his tongue, but too
many of the team equate authoritative-
ness with solemnity, human interest with
frivolity, and opinion with information.
Michael Willesee, the unit’s staff con-
tributor in Canberra, constantly makes
the mistake of confusing Australian
politics with the dramas of Washington.
It’s a fault common to many areas of
public-affairs programming in Austra-
lian TV, and was characterised by the
production television made of the
Liberals’ stampede for the Prime
Ministership (an event which caused
Channel 7’s John Moses to say some-
thing to the effect that the TV coverage
meant that Australian politics would
never quite be the same again. God help
us!). Willesee almost visibly drools over
political drama and is inclined to invest
his summaries with the catchall cliches
of a B-grade journalist or the clumsy
metaphors of a gossip columnist.
I don’t think that “This Day
Tonight” is as politically neutral as its
hierarchy says it is, or as its responsi-
bilities call for it to be, but neither do
I think it is subversively Left Wing
an occasional criticism for political
purposes, anyway. Because it is a young
program and represents the progressive
endeavors of youngish men who are
anything but conservative, it has the
youthful manner of rebelliousness which,
unfortunately or not, translates into
view as a sort of urgent disestablish-
mentarianism. If a member of the politi-
cal establishment is standing in the way,
he’s likely to get his toes run over.
The effect wouldn’t appear to be so
politically partisan if “TDT” could
keep its cool. But when it fastens on to
some transient injustice or example of
bureaucratic idiocy it quivers with
barely controlled rage as if its function
for the night is to bring the whole
nation to the boil more than to dis-
passionately give us the facts. It
quivered away over the Simon Towns-
end case last week as if it alone was
fighting his barbarous confinement. Only
a lunatic would think that the practice
of waking up a prisoner every half
hour was tolerable, but “TDT” shoul-
dered its way up to the subject with
indignant righteousness which came
dangerously close to moving the con-
troversy out of context and ignored
the calm but effective protest already
gathering in the Press. Caught up
in the ABC’s quest for ratings,
“TDT” is inclined to forget that it
has a large audience that doesn’t
want to be converted to a point of view
by anger, only coolly informed in the
summary way that television can make
so digestible.
And its producers might not be aware
of the misinterpretation lying not far
from that übiquitous tagline, “We
invited Norman Cringe, Bill Sikes,
Gilbert and Sullivan, and the Minister
for Sewers to make a comment, but
they declined to appear.” It is one


thing for “TDT” to protect its sense
of fair play but quite another to
imagine that the Prime Minister, the
Treasurer—or anyone, for that matter—
has an obligation to miss dinner, grab
a pie, and hare out to the ABC for the
privilege of appearing on “This Day
Tonight.” The Press knows the impli-
cations of the words “no comment”
and uses them judiciously.
The program is at its most vulnerable
to criticism when its staff men are sub-
jective, because it seems to lack editorial
judgment. Neither John Power nor
Ken Chown, who alternate in Sydney as
the senior producers, gives his editions
enough journalistic discipline; Allan
Martin’s inspiration, as executive pro-
ducer, appeals to have weakened since
he gave the program its early impetus.
Power’s editions are usually slightly
more incisive, but neither he nor Chown
can cope with the inconsequentialities
supplied from the Melbourne end of the
coaxial cable.
The Melbourne “TDT” staff seem to
function as gigglers, or at least to con-
tribute the night’s coy giggle. My
instant memory of Melbourne contri-
butions would be a phantasmagoria in
which Brian Joyce, in a tracksuit, is
trailing a microphone after an octo-
genarian health faddist on a nine-mile
run; Eric Hunter, hanging bat-like from
a tree, demonstrating the effects of
high altitudes on Olympic athletes; and
Peter Couchman trying to bring clerical
solemnity to a discussion with an
hilarity of flat-earthers. Some of the
program’s most trivial moments
originate in Melbourne and it often
seems a waste of money to maintain
such a comparatively large unit down
there.
The principal virtue of “This Day
Tonight” is its existence; its developing
failings are rooted in its existence with-
out competition, causing it to play down
to a large, hypnotised section of its
audience. It can’t be blamed for its
lack of competition, but it should by
now have a sense of responsibility that
keeps it from descent into laziness and
smugness.
The subliminal campaign to represent
anchorman Bill Peach as a sex symbol
is the silliest fragment of the desire to
make “TDT” a cult, and should be
no deliberate part of a public-affairs
program. Unfortunately, it is beginning
to affect Mr. Peach’s own ordinarily
balanced approach. Among his tail-end
drolleries and homespun philosophies on
a recent Friday night, he pandered to a
fan’s curiosity by explaining that the
object he handled during the roll of the
show’s “Ben Hur” proportioned credits
was a vacuum flask containing coffee
“with a little something to keep my
eyes from watering.” Imagine that!
It makes me think that we might not
be far from satirical truth; that Bill
Peach one night will pick up that phone
on his desk and say, “I’ve told you
before, darling—you mustn’t ring me at
work.”
Music
Rewards
and surprises
By KENNETH ROBINS
MARILYN RICHARDSON’S recital
at the Cell Block Theatre covered the
whole gamut of vocal art with the
exception of the most spectacular
aspects of coloratura. For the life of me
I can’t imagine why Sydney’s music-
lovers don’t turn out in greater num-
bers to a recital like this one; after all,
Miss Richardson’s talent has been ex-
posed long enough on our city’s musical
scene for them to be assured of a re-
warding experience.
Three French songs opened the
program, the first two of which were
from the early 1200s and surprisingly
sophisticated. The guitar accompani-
ments, played splendidly by Don
Andrews, were, I suspect, of a later
date, as the polyphony displayed in
them was far from primitive. Having
music in this period sung by unformed
voices has always seemed an odd con-
ceit, but I did feel Miss Richardson
brought over much “voice” to these
songs, although the Dowland and
Campion songs which followed went
very well indeed, as did “Have You
Seen But a Whyte Lillie Grow,” sung
with the addition of some delicious
graces.
The only real disappointment of the
evening was in the Schubert group
which came next. Light followed dark
relentlessly throughout and this oscilla-
tion gave too much of a piecemeal
effect, also although the musical gods
laid their hands on Schubert very early
his work at 16 years of age does not,
with a few remarkable exceptions, sit
happily beside his later songs. The
serious songs in this group were un-
accountably marred by intonation lapses
—whole phrases at times wandered dis-
concertingly off pitch. Miss Richard-
son redeemed herself utterly in “Die
Unterscheidung,” the last song in the
group, which was a thorough joy. John
Champ, the pianist, was far too tenta-
tive and was often found palely loiter-
ing; Miss Richardson is a formidable
singer and he need never fear that full
collaboration is likely to steal her
thunder.
“Songs from the Chinese,” by Ben-
jamin Britten, completed the first half,
and here Miss Richardson’s intelligence
and musical expertise came through
loud and clear. Don Andrews’ accom-
paniments were evocative and accurate,
although a few harmonics proved to be
elusive and the glissandos in “Depres-
sion” were inclined to die before they
reached their destination. As to be
expected in a “first in Australia,” there
was probably too much care in the per-
formance, but I hope Miss Richardson
will keep this fascinating set in her
extraordinarily extensive repertoire, as
I can imagine no resident singer who
is likely to make a better job of them.
By the second half the slight huski-
ness which was apparent in the early
part of the recital had disappeared and
the Italian songs by Rossini, Verdi,
Bellini, and Donizetti got the full treat-
ment: golden ringing tone at the top
and warm and opulent in the lower
register. The short Bellini song was a
copybook example of what people
mean when they talk about bel canto. In
the final Spanish group I would have
preferred two guitars; “El Vito,” for
example, required much more punch
in the accompaniment to match the
earthy violent sensuality which the
singer brought to the song.
A CONCERT by Gordon Watson is
never a tame perfunctory affair and
his recital in the Great Hall of Sydney
University was no exception to this
rule. Mr. Wilson is unique among
Sydney’s musicians; he refuses to treat
music as a sacred cow, he has lasting
love affairs with Weber, Bellini, and
Liszt, he is articulate and some would
say overforthright, and he plays the
piano with tremendous elan. Who else
would have the gall to introduce a
sonata by Constant Lambert into that
unholy of unholies the International
Society for Contemporary Music (Syd-
ney). Not unexpectedly this sonata was
a salutary lesson in sheer compositional
technique. Here was a work in which
jazz rhythms really jumped and were
not intellectualised or clinically
deprived of life in the Stravinsky man-
ner. Behind the mercurial Lambert there
was more than a hint of darkness, but
this was never strong enough to con-
stitute an alien threat to the overall
freshness of the work. It received a
sparkling performance with everything
etched in clearly, and if there were any
wrong notes, which I doubt, they were
played with such aplomb as to be
regarded as a more than adequate sub-
stitute for the right ones.
From the two studies taken from
that wonderful and unaccountably
neglected set of Debussy through the
strange world of middle period Bar-
tok in his “Out of Doors” suite to the
huffing and puffing of Humphrey
Searle’s Sonata, one became increas-
ingly conscious that here was a resident
musician who is a virtuoso pianist.
Colin Brumby’s “Theme and Varia-
tions” had its first performance at this
concert. Mr. Brumby is Senior Lecturer
in Music at the University of Queens-
land, but his piece was free from
academic overtones. It did not wholly
renounce tonality, yet it seemed to me
to be a work of genuine originality.
Variations these days are so way-out
that I often feel “episodes on a theme”
or “ruminations on a theme” would be
a better title for the genre, but this
should not be regarded as a reflection
of Mr. Brumby’s ingenuity.
We incline to talk about the works
these days somewhat to the exclusion
of the performer, and while this is a
worthy state it was refreshing to have
the process reversed, for this was indeed
Mr. Watson’s night.

bourne.

WHILE THERE are enough costumes,
scene changes, and players in the first
act of “Marne” for an entire repertory
season, beneath its intimidating reful-
gence there’s barely enough content for
a quick sketch on “Mavis.”
Granted, the successful musical is
usually a case of mindlessness over
matter but “Marne” the musical of
the movie of the play of the best-seller
•—has lost much of its original oomph.
Partly this is the result of being a fuzzy
fourth carbon, but it’s also the outcome
of the author’s decision to mute Marne
to make her more socially acceptable.
She still enjoys her highballs and
oddballs, but she has lost her high-
camp quality, and Broadway senti-
mentality has sapped her bitchiness.
Where she used to blow a resounding
raspberry, she now warbles as sweetly
as Eliza, Dolly, or Charity. The charac-
ter is further softened by Gaylea Byrne,
who has none of Rosalind Russell’s
rough edges. Instead, she gives the part
a lovable gamin quality.
The better moments come from Mary
Hardy’s wildly overacted but successful
performance as the extremely plain and
very pregnant Agnes Gooch, and John
Frawley is also amusingly puffed-up as
Dwight Babcock, Marne’s pompous
banker. Fred Hebert has drilled his
troops and stagehands with his usual
efficiency, and Noel Smith wields an
imperious baton over Jerry Herman’s
passable score. But all their efforts can’t
hide the fact that Jerome Lawrence
and Robert E. Lee have presented us
with a very tame Marne.
Peter Shaffer is a playwright whose
cleverness serves to emphasise his
shallowness. A few years back his
“Royal Hunt of The Sun” was being
hailed in London as “the play of its
generation.” Now we can see that it
was nothing more than an ingenious
piece of conjuring—the stage at its
stagiest. “White Liars” is a similarly
arty piece, cleverly constructed but
without depth or resonance. But “Black
Comedy,” which exploits a device from
the Chinese Opera, is a damned funny
piece of entertainment. A young couple
are host and hostess to an ill-assorted
group of guests in a flat with a blown
fuse. We watch them groping as blind
as bats around the brilliantly lit stage
banging into doors, and each other’s
bosoms and bottoms. Invention flags
toward the end, but for a surprising
length of time the piece works like a
charm. Much of the credit for the play’s
success must go to a young English
actor called Trevor Bowen, who per-
formed with Keystone expertise.

SOUNDS BY TEXAS
RADIO station 2GB’s current identi-
fication jingle is a few bars of
“Waltzing Matilda.” What goes unsaid
is that those few bars are electronically
produced sounds made in Dallas,
Texas.
Ironically, many Australian radio
stations are ordering their identifica-
tion signals from a company in Dallas
■—necessary, it seems, if you want to
keep pace with this electronic age.
Aware of the un-Australian conno-
tations in the situation, Des Foster,
2GB’s station manager, says there’s
nowhere else to go. “Even the BfBC
uses this company, because they have
such fantastic equipment like 12-
track recorders, and other things I
don’t understand. The fact that we
don’t use an Australian company is not
a reflection on the industry here it’s
just that it’s not a big enough market
to justify other companies equipping
themselves as PAMS, the Dallas firm,
has.”
Nevertheless, Foster says the “hum-
bugging” of the Broadcasting Control
Board finally prompted 2GB’s decision
in favor of the foreign product. “We
made our own jingles for five years,
but it was hellishly hard work to do,
and there didn’t seem to be much
point in it, because the Broadcasting
Control Board doesn’t count commer-
cials as helping Australian composers.
They looked at it as our way of getting
up our five percent quota of Australian
material, and we got tired of the whole
business.”
WHO WON?
THE COST of the ABC’s midnight-
to-dawn madness involving the satellite
relay of last week’s Indianapolis 500
has been reliably estimated as at least
$50,000 —• that is, unless they didn’t
have to pay for the hire of the satellite
for pictures, the Compac cable for
sound, and their share of the rights for
the four-hour live telecast. It was one
way of proving that the ABC still caters
for minority interests, despite its partici-
pation in the ratings game, but it seems
a lot to spend just to satisfy insomniacs
and racing-car fans. If the money came
from an end-of-the-financial-year sur-
plus which had to be spent before June
30, it makes the financing of the ABC’s
operations even more mysterious.
As an exercise in modern communi-
cations, the telecast proved nothing that
hadn’t already been proved. It was weak
on public-service value and the public
interest in it even with the strenuous
artificial stimulation which punctuated
ABC newscasts for a week — was
limited. By the time “This Day
Tonight” began puffing it with film
dips of spectacular crashes in previous
years, the whole project became slightly
sado-masochistic.
Not surprisingly, there were last-
minute doubts about the wisdom of the
telecast within the ABC itself, particu-
larly after someone pointed out that a
recording of the race, air-freighted from
San Francisco, could be put to air in
Sydney slightly less than 36 hours after
the event. Urgency won the day, though,
even ' if Australia’s marginal involve-
ment in the race—a Repco-Bra'bham—
didn’t win the event.
But the strangest aspect of the ABC’s
fascination with the communications
satellite Intelsat II is the lack of inter-
est it’s said to be showing in a co-opera-
tive venture among Australian TV
stations to bring nightly edited reports
of the 1968 Olympics by satellite from
Mexico. Unless it has plans for other
spectaculars of its own (Test cricket
from Lords?) at that time, the ABC
would seem to be seriously misjudging
its audiences.
THE LITTLE THAT HELPS
AUTHOR Thomas Keneally will be
off into Henry Lawson territory this
weekend to collect the award for the
finest contribution to the arts in 1967,
given at the annual festival at Grenfell.
As seems appropriate to anything bear-
ing Lawson’s name, the award carries
no cash.
We imagine that Keneally, condi-
tioned by early years in a seminary
and later ones at a typewriter, is
relatively indifferent to money, except
insofar as it buys him freedom to write.
However, it does seem things have im-
proved a little since Lawson’s days.
Since his second novel, “The Fear,”
was published in 1965, Keneally has
won two Commonwealth Literary Fund
grants, one of $4000 for 1966 and one
of $6000 this year. He received $1000
from the University of N.S.W. Drama
Foundation to write “Halloran’s Little
Boat.” His second play, “Childermas,”
was commissioned by the Committee of
Responsibility for Children in Vietnam.
He has been commissioned to write a
“Project ’68” documentary on convicts.
In April he received the Miles Franklin
Award of $1000.
In 'September he takes up an appoint-
ment as lecturer in drama at the Uni-
versity of New England. Current
lecturer’s scale is minimum $5400,
maximum $7300. As well, Keneally
collects hard-earned royalties from three
novels (another to come later this year)
and two plays.
All this may not put him in Graham
Kennedy’s class as an income-earner,
but he may be getting near the Prime
Minister’s.


Art
Chaos controlled
By ELWYN LYNN
Grace Cossington Smith. Macquarie
Galleries, Sydney.
COMMENTATORS justly make much
of Grace Cossington Smith’s steady and
logical development; in her case, by
“logical” they mean the continuity of
frontality and of the broken touch which
became a shield or shifting veil of
mosaics. The mosaic is adumbrated in
the earliest work here, of 1925, and
even in such decorative art-nouveau
pieces like Thirroul Pier, of 1934, and
since it was a Cezannesque technique it
received Sydney’s blessing because, until
about 1959, Cezanne was almost the
sole permissive influence, and was taken
as the well-spring and measure of
modernism just as Greenbergian
modernism is equated with flatness. (As
Marx said he was no Marxist, Green-
berg might say he is no Greenbergian.)
Miss Smith played a significant part
in the Cezanne movement in her own
Reticent and quietly joyous manner, but
it seems necessary to emphasise that
she retained her individuality, for
notions of art’s continuity, which has
been stressed by Mr. Greenberg, tend
to play down personalities and hardly
explain* the sudden irruption on the
scene of such heroes as Courbet, Pol-
lock, or Gauguin, and perhaps it is
significant that Mr. Greenberg prefers
the Breton Gauguins, which move within
the prevailing movement, to his later
South Sea works. [I might interpolate
that we are going through a period of
Greenberg as Father Figure with a con-
sequent simplification of his views.]
Greenberg’s view of an artist’s internal
continuity and continuity with tradition
is as common as the related view that
art structures chaos; this is precisely
what Daniel Thomas says of Miss Smith
in “Art and Australia” (March, 1967),
but there is a dissident in the camp.
In his “Rage for Chaos” (Schocken,
$3.70) Morse Peckham argues that art
violates the deep demand of the mind
for order, that order that ends in every-
thing from mystic monism to totali-
tarianism. Art destroys this order that
limits freedom. However ordered a work
of art may look, like "Miss Smith’s, it
always contains disordered, powerful,
wayward features. Any work of worth,
says Peckham, has this rage for chaos;
of course he exaggerates, and just as
rage can hardly be applied to Miss
Smith’s work it can hardly be used
convincingly by Peckham of Watteau’s
The Embarkation to Cythera. There
will always, says Peckham, be features
in a work of art at odds with the
artist’s style and with the artistic con-
tinuum in which he operates. In face
of all the stress on continuity, he
asserts, as did Francis Bacon, that
beauty will always have something
strange in it.
This conflict between order and law-
lessness, this disjunction between styles,
is faintly evident in Miss Smith’s very
fine painting Bush With a White Gum
(1938), with the tough criss-cross of
trees in contrast with the almost form-
less foreground grass, which keeps the
arboreal structure in its place; for
structure becomes too independent in
The Weir (1938), where the semi-
diagonals have to be checked by corner
pieces that resemble stage props. In the
pale, dun Moss Vale Landscape (1938)
the genesis of her structure and of her
later emphasis on mosaic brush strokes
is clear, the mosaics becoming independ-
ent of the grass and clouds they sug-
gest and setting up a tension with the
structure. It was, of course, Cezanne’s
problem, too, for once he had found the
Impressionists lacking in structure, he
had to dissolve structure in planes of
light in his later work. What Miss
Smith was doing in balancing mosaic
against a structure in works full of the
open rhythms of landscape and the
disrupted rhythms of the bush was
quite different from what she did in
Bush Track (1925), where the foliage
was purely decorative. It is difficult to
trace her development from this
exhibition; one might think by the late
’forties she had decided to subjugate the
insistent structure that is so unrelenting
in Pumpkin Trees Drooping (1926) and
in Troops in George Street (1942) to
a floating, unanchored deployment of
mosaics of color, but an enticing Studio
Doorway of 1941, with an opalescent
fusing of yellowed ochres and pearly
creams, and a tender ephemeral surface,
predicts Bush in a Haze ten years later,
Here, structure has almost disappeared
and all becomes a shifting foreground
and this continues in Bush in Light
(1959), where more structure in the
form of branches is permitted, but now
it’s the subtle orchestration of color that
reduces the structural emphasis. Yet, in
the last work here, Window (1966), she
returns to the window’s firm form but
dissolves it in the mosaics of congealed
fight-
Miss Smith has kept her slight pen-
chant for chaos under control, and while
one admires the unpretentious dedica-
tion in works that are about the enjoy-
ment of the act of painting as well as
about painting’s content, one wishes she
would have loosened the tether more
often.
Films
How 'Clever Dick' came good
by BEVERLEY TIVEY
How I Won the War. Director, Richard
Lester.
“CLEVER DICK” has always been the
obvious nickname for Richard Lester,
ever since “iThe Running, Jumping, and
Standing Still Film,” which was smart
and funny in an unco-ordinated way.
While admiring the technical originality
of “The Knack” I found it a most un-
likable film; the Beatles movies were
good fun (but how much of this was
due to the Beatles themselves, a quick-
witted and engaging quartet?). “A
Funny Thing Happened on the Way
to the Forum” was a grand romp, but
by its very nature superficial. Was
Lester, then, really just clever-clever?
“How I Won the War,” as far as
I’m concerned, answers that question
with a resounding negative. Clever Dick
has not only got a sharp wit and a
wild imagination he has a heart and
a serious mind. This extraordinary
movie is funny, shocking, and moving
in almost equal proportions.
Lester himself has described it as
“an anti-war-film film,” and certainly
many old favorites, from the heroic to
the jolly adventure, get a resounding
raspberry. But it is also a genuine
protest against war itself, which is
presented as a series of absurdities inter-
rupted by periods of equally senseless
violence and terror and Lester mani-
pulates these contrasts brilliantly. When
his audience is totally abandoned to
laughter, the director shocks them back
to the horrid reality, only to sweep
them away again on a tide of laughter.
It may not be magnifique, but c’est la
guerre, all right.
And if it’s objected that slapstick
and harsh realism don’t mix, the only
answer is that in the event the technique
works: the moments of shock and un-
easiness are deliberate and accurately
calculated.
The cast is superb. Michael Crawford
plays Lieutenant Goodbody, a decent
sort who only gradually reveals himself
as a genuine destroyer, embodying the
fatal combination of a little authority,
total inefficiency, and unshakable belief
in what he’s doing. Crawford, growing
in stature as a comedian, is engaging,
droll, ultimately terrifying; his conver-
sations with a dapper “good German”
are among the film’s most telling
sequences. Michael Hordern is remark-
ably funny as the Staff Officer Unfor-
tunately confused as to just what war
he’s fighting he gives his men tips
on trench warfare and how to deal with
“the wily Pathan” and even tiny
roles (like Alexander Knox’s 'U.S.
General, a part which can’t have
covered more than two lines of script)
are brilliantly played.
But ultimately it’s Lester’s film, with
its free construction and ostensible yet
disciplined disregard for the rules of
movie-making.


BOOKS
Australia’s soldiers in Vietnam
By PETER SAMUEL
Vietnam Task: The Fifth Battalion,
Royal Australian Regiment. Robert
O’Neill. Cassell Australia. $5.00.
JOURNALISTS ARE NOT very popu-
lar people at the Australian Task Force
base at Nui Dat, in Vietnam. When I
was there last month I was subjected
to an almost continuous series of har-
angues against professional colleagues.
They are disliked, for their political
stance, which generally puts them as
antagonists to Australian involvement.
They are accused of gross inaccuracy,
even of inventing stories in slack periods.
Like journalists anywhere, they are
attacked for “sensationalism,” for writ-
ing more drama into a report than the
participant thinks was justified. But in
Vietnam it worries the soldiers especi-
ally acutely because they claim that
“sensationalist” newspaper reports cause
unnecessary fear and unhappiness
among their families back home. But
most of all they dislike journalists for
the books they have written: for their
lurid exposes of what they consider
trivial incidents which deserve to have
been forgotten long ago. And with
obvious justification they say that journ-
alists and academics writing about the
war know far less than they do about
it, and reckon they could do a better
job.
Well, here at last is a book that
should satisfy the men who have fought
in Vietnam. It is written by one of
them: Major O’Neill, who served with
the Task Force in Vietnam for 12
months. As Intelligence Officer to one
of the battalions, he was intimately
involved in the planning and assess-
ment of operations, as well as being
constantly in the firing line. As Dr.
O’Neill, lecturer in history at the Mili-
tary College, Duntroon, and author of
a highly regarded book on relations
between the German Army and the
Nazi Party,' he is obviously well quali-
fied to analyse this war. Yet the book
is a modest one. It is mainly a chronicle
of the operations of the battalion dur-
ing the year, and it mostly avoids
direct comment on the general issues
about which the controversy on the
war rages.
It is a readable, lively account
chapter-by-chapter of military opera-
tions. In each chapter, the author takes
time off to describe in detail a particu-
lar aspect of life as a Vietnam com-
batant: the difficulties of moving at
night, insects, reactions to battle
casualty, the problems of constantly
wet feet, relations with villagers, the
landscape. Each operation is sufficiently
different from the others to keep the
reader interested and to tell him some-
thing new about the war. And, unlike
the huge Public Relations section of
the Army Department, O’Neill manages
very well to explain military operations,
putting each in its geographic and
political context and outlining clearly
its objective and commenting frankly
on its outcome. Instead of appearing as
a series of endless “contacts” in which
individuals simply try to kill one an-
other, the actions of our troops assume
a purposive character as elements of a
strategy.
There will be a good deal of news in
the book for many people. To me, at
least, it has never been clear before that
the two battalions had great difficulty
in establishing the Task Force base at
Nui Dat and that they were in serious
danger of being overrun. A danger
that was averted only by skilful sweep
and patrol operations through the area
during the shift-in and construction
phase. Many Army people are critical
of the site chosen for the camp, and
unfortunately O’Neill does not give this
more than a few lines.
There is a lot of interesting practical
information about the difficulties in
making use of helicopters, and a great
number of observations about the Com-
munist troops, many of which cut across
conventional stereotype pictures.
O’Neill was impressed by their careless-
ness in many situations. Except when
mounting an offensive operation, they
are generally lacking in caution: sing-
ing and joking and usually wearing
rifles slung as they move down jungle
trails. They are inflexible sometimes:
as in the case when one of the VC
regiments in the province persisted
with its military plans despite the
obvious risk that those plans had fallen
into Australian hands. In fact they had,
because the Deputy Commander, after
a panic escape, had left behind in his
HQ cave his diary containing them.
Their capture was of great importance
to our HQ in anticipating Communist
troop movements for about four
months afterwards.
There are some insights into the sort
of ruses and feints which are essential
to success in war: the establishment of
a phony pattern of truck movement,
for instance, to conceal the mounting
of an operation, the use of VC-sympa-
thetic bargirls to spread false informa-
tion on Australian plans so as to foul
up their intelligence, and so on. O’Neill
delights in recounting some of the
humor of war: the discovery of dainty
lingerie in the temple of the apparently
abstemious, ascetic Buddhist monk, a
race between Armored Personnel
Carriers and ox-carts, and some of the
scrounging of supplies for which Aus-
tralian troops are notorious.
Unfortunately, he doesn’t go into
detail on this last subject, because it
has its more serious aspect. As in the
factories of Russia, scrounging is often
a sheer necessity for survival in the
Australian Army, because the misman-
agement of logistics, the red tape, and
delays are so bad. Some accounts have
it that there was complete logistics
chaos for a month after Australian
troops arrived in Phuoc Tuy. They
O’Neill. .. Intelligence Officer
were without food, essential parts for
machine-guns, tent poles, and a whole
host of other items. Without scrounging
at American camps they could easily
have died of hunger or been overrun,
because so many weapons were incom-
plete and would not function. O’Neill
has no comment on this.
Within the Army, at least, the most
controversial aspect of the book is
going to be its strong advocacy of what
may be called the Graham-strategy,
after the Task Force commander of the
time (though it appears that Colonel
Warr of the Fifth Battalion and O’Neill
himself played a significant role in
forming it, also).
This strategy starts with the assump-
tion that the Vietnam War is at root a
war for the support and control of the
peasant population of the villages and
hamlets of the country. The main-force
regular troops were the sword and
shield, the ultimate power of the Com-
munists but not its essential agents.
These were the village cadres, who

telligence for the Communist military
forces, and genera ly run the village
along Communist lines. But unti the
Communist main force is neutralised,

cadres and safely replace them with
Government officials. But this does not
necessarily require a war of attrition

doctrmated to believe that their mission
was to liberate the people, their isola-
tion in the jungle would breed defeat-
ism, bringing defections and serious
morale problems.
The Americans often .tend to judge
success in terms of enemy body-count
ratioed to friendly casualties, but the
Graham doctrine had it that this was
not the main issue, which was the
extent of support for, and control by,
the Government. “We were convinced
that the solution to the Vietnam crisis
lay in the villages rather than in the
jungles,” O’Neill says.
In judging the relative merits of dif-
ferent types of operation, O’Neill argues
that cordon-and-search of villages
proves far more effective than con-
ventional sweeps. He provides statistics

The shaping of things to come in music
By KENNETH ROBINS
Caliban Reborn. Wilfred Mellers.
Victor Gollancz. $4.60.
PROFESSOR MELLERS’ scholarship
is encyclopedic, yet his view of the
wood is rarely obscured by the trees.
There is so much uncommon sense
and sensitivity in his first chapter,
“Revelation and Incarnation: the
Legacy of the Past,” that it is heartily
recommended to everybody who re-
gards music as a serious part of their
lives.
Broadly speaking, the book equates
the font and aim of pre-Renaissance
music with Revelation; Renaissance and
post-Renaissance music with Incarna-
tion, and regards the 20th century as a
rebirth of Revelation. The larger part,
however, is devoted to the music of
this century, and in tracing the paths
from the late romantic to the music
of our time it is refreshing to find
Mellers treating Debussy as a major
catalyst as well as an enduring force
in the music of our day. The detailed
and sensitive description of “Pelleas
and Melisande,” which Mellers regards
as epitomising the twilight of human-
ism, is a virtuoso performance despite
his tendency to see symbols which I
am sure escaped both Debussy and
Maeterlinck.
By the first decade of the 1900 s,
Love and Death, very strong stuff in
the 1800 s, had been well worked over.
The final word, musically, had been
said by Wagner, fusing the two in
“Tristan” and ' sanctifying this union
in “Parsifal,” and by Debussy in
“Pelleas” in a less flamboyant manner
and from a different premise.
Mellers then sets the stage for his
investigation of the music of today.
There is hardly a page which does not
contain a worthwhile observation
clothed in imaginative and sometimes
pungent prose. On Messiaen, for ex-
ample, he says “he, more than any
other single composer of our time,
represents modern man’s weariness with
a literate, will-dominated patriarchal
culture , . .” Statements like this are
salutary, even out of context. At times,
however, he is inclined to reveal a
dichotomy which I find disconcerting,
such as his statement on Orff’s “Car-
mina Burana,” that “its banality is
sometimes inspired,” which smacks of
the cultish, analogous with vogues like
television’s “Batman.”
I never cease to be dismayed by the
desire of people who should know bet-
ter to be with-it, even if “it” appears
to be demonstrably meretricious.
Nevertheless, I would not suggest that
Professor Mellers’ flirting with the idea
that all the world’s a sage (see
McLuhan) invalidates or even blunts
his argument that the primitivism of
early Stravinsky and Orff contributed
an element which was a major force in
leading music back to its original
revelationary function. This must not
be construed as a descent on to artistic
all fours, as the leavening of Debussy
and Messiaen ensures a semi-upright
stance.
The sections on Boulez and Stock-
hausen will be difficult for the aware
layman and will not be too easy for
the professional; for, despite the lucid
and careful links which the author has
forged, the element of iconoclasm in
these composers makes the evolutionary
process difficult to sustain. Despite this
hazard the Wagner, Schoenberg,
Webern, Stockhausen, and the Debussy,
Satie, Messiaen, Boulez progression is
given commendable coherence.
Some of us who made an effort to
climb aboard the contemporary band-
wagon before World War II were grati-
fied to observe the eclipse of Varese
(who was a little too much for us)
in the post-war period. But from Pro-
fessor Mellers’ account it would appear
that this eclipse was confined to Aus-
tralia, as he gives plenty of space to
Varese’s significant contribution.
From here on, the pace accelerates
and the ideas tumble over each other
in a wild collage matching the tempo
of our times. This section does prove,
however, that Professor Mellers is as
with-it, in the best sense, as any person
living. He digs just about everything,
he tosses around such names as Charlie
Parker, Jimmy Giuffre, Ornette Cole-
man, and obviously knows what he is
talking about. He preserves the distinc-
tion between jazz and pop and yet he
unaccountably attributes a significance
to the quasi-modal effusions of the
Beatles but never, I fear, conceiving that
they could be the result of a restricted
guitar technique. But perhaps this is
an over-simplification; has he indeed
seen a genuine issue? Has he indeed
seen “developments in pop music
(which) cannot be isolated from what
is happening in serious music”?
The final chapter suggests that the
wheel has already begun to turn, and
that we could well be embarking on a
period which will be a combination of
the best aspects of Incarnation and
Revelation. This chapter, with its tacit
admission that evolutionary traces are
not wholly extinct, contains some in-
cipient nostalgia clothed in empirical
analysis which could indicate where
the author’s heart really lies. However,
those who find civilisation and illiteracy
impossible to equate will not be happy
with the shape of things to come as
espoused here.
Professor Mellers’ book is a major
contribution to musical literature, its
appeal and significance is probably
limited to the musically literate, but
there is plenty in it to stimulate any-
body who is interested in philosophic,
social, or aesthetic issues.

Ever been
caught
by a boom ?
There has never been a time in
Australia’s history when people have
been as wine conscious as they are
now. But the great upsurge in
interest, coupled with a dry year,
have created shortages of many of
the best wines Australia produces.
One of the things about a boom,
when the goods are in short supply,
is that standards can slip.
Orlando’s standards will not slip.
For years, in anticipation, we have
been thinking ahead - planting new
areas and new varieties, developing
and exploring new techniques and
equipment - and we will continue to
do so. But even so, current demand
has outstripped us. If you find
difficulty on occasion in obtaining
your chosen Orlando table wines,
we hope you will remember that
while we would like to take
advantage of the boom, we are
utterly convinced that it is more
important to preserve the quality
that has achieved such high
recognition of our wines at home
and abroad.

Understanding the
human motive

$2.95.
Nest in a Falling Tree. Joy Cowley.

“THE ROO SHOOTER” is a short,
loosely constructed novel whose very
great interest lies neither in its skill
as a work of fiction nor in its style
both are merely passable but in its
documentary authenticity and timeli-
ness. Whether you actively support the
arguments of conservationists and
others opposed to kangaroo slaughter,
or whether you feel confused by the
counter-arguments of those who approve
controlled killing, this is a book for
you. In parts it is brutal, in parts
beautiful.
Paradoxically the most sympathetic
accounts of animal life have often
(especially in America) been written
by people who hunted for food or fur.
Weatherly, a professional “roo
shooter,” belongs to the tradition of
writers like Ernest Seton Thomson: he
enjoys the tracking and the chase and
his own skill and prowess, he respects
worthy antagonists, and sometimes he
sentimentalises his victims. Always he
finds kangaroos, their habits and
heredity, fascinating. Whatever your
views you will finish this book with an
increased understanding of human
motive, of animals, and of some mat-
ters of natural history. For instance,
one of the most interesting parts of
Weatherly’s book is his theory about
the immemorial routes followed by red
kangaroos, and although I cannot find
his theory confirmed in any textbook
I am sure he is right hunters must
reckon with such behaviour patterns.
David Schlunke contributes excellent
black-and-white illustrations.
Also well illustrated, with apt and
amusing pictures by Peter Harrigan, is
“The Winds That Blew at Cossack.”
This account of life in that remote
Western Australian seaport dates to
some thirty years ago when Cossack,
now a ghost town, was already declining
as it had lived boisterously. The
author and her husband witnessed
events from the dead-centre vantage
point of the only pub, of which they
were managers. Linked threads, some
hilariously funny, some tragic, hold
together episodes in which a rich
assortment of incredibly credible
characters are described with verve,
sympathy, and grace.
“Nest in a Falling Tree” is a true
novel, its New Zealand author’s first.
It wholly deserves its overseas praise
(“It is a magnificent piece of work”
Alec Waugh). Technically, Joy Cow-
ley’s accomplishment in making her
first-person narrative widely embracing
and convincing is not the least of its
merits. The setting is circumscribed,
the characters few, but the novel’s
impact is savage and its implications
broad. Maura, the narrator, is a spinster
of 43, who lives with her invalid and
blind mother in a house too large for
their purse or energy. They decide to
employ a rather ambiguous boy of 18
who will board with them and do
gardening and heavy work on his day
off. Neighbors deplore and gossip. The
church group is agog. Were Maura,
Mother, and Percy mere stock charac-
ters the whole would be predictable and
sickly, but in every way both situations
and characters are shown new and in
a very original way. Surprising
moments of humor relieve this compel-
ling, sad, and inevitable story which
ends with Maura alone, her mother
dead, her lover deserted, her erstwhile
friends alienated.
STATUES
What happened to his schoolboy
idols?
They were always stilled in statue,
immobile
Where chisel fixed their rebellion in
stone.
Hasn’t he murdered them, cracked
them now,
laid out the backbone of his race
in a cold clamp of earth? Hasn’t he
layered bones to rest in fossil?
Did he see himself in the earth with
his heroes?
How can an angle of bones shout
Injustice
through time to an aging
archaeologist?
Was his protest the burning rubber
peeling tyres down a slash of road?
Only a car out of control, not him.
See him give death to the howling
crowd
that only turns on him in surprise
on seeing his eyes deep-set,
sunken in the rings of a sullen fish
strung up for days in a shop window.
Haunted by wind carving in sand
the hollows of his face
He caught the posture of heroes
in this century he loathed.
Crowds strike antics round his pose
now,
forming themselves, performing their
roles
about his broken figure.
Who’s to blame them when he, a
sculptor,
even into his own hand, chipped his
own statue?

FLYING THEIR
OWN COLORS
“THREE YEARS AGO we were driv-
ing from Melbourne, and were just
this side of the Arch of Remembrance
in Ballarat. It all came to me. I started
bashing my wife’s ear and didn’t finish
until we drove into the garage at
home.” Home is the Ryecroft Vine-
yards and Winery in McLaren Flats,
30 miles south of Adelaide, in South
Australia. The ear-basher was J. N.
Ingoldby (Jim Junior), the manager
and wine-maker of Ryecroft. “It”
cannot be dismissed in a sentence.
“It” was the fact that for many
years the McLaren Vale area had
been producing beautiful full-bodied
reds of great charm and distinction,
and that few people knew much about
them, by heavens. The region had
been developed as a wine area for
over a hundred years, in fact, but the
main markets were ignorant of the
quality of the wines. They tasted them,
all right, in blends that other people
put out, and they recognised the
quality, for they kept on buying the
blends. But this wasn’t good enough.
True, the big boys like Hardy’s and
Seaview had been identified with the
area. True, they were established and
had won many prizes. But that only
showed that the quality was there and
that the wine-buying public weren’t
getting a fair deal. Why didn’t they,
the smaller makers, get together and
form a company that would market
the regional wines under their own
label? Then the growing public drink-
ing wine would come to recognise their
quality and become aware of the
identity of one of the great red wine
areas of Australia.
Good idea? Good idea. Watch that
car, darling.
So Jim got together with Edge Den-
nis, a local grower, and a university
lecturer named Burr Dodd (you’ve got
to have some culture), and the
McLaren Vale wine company was born.
In February, 1966, they brought out
their first wines under that name, with
each label stating the grower, maker,
grape variety, vineyard, soil type,
maturation, and chief characteristics.
I have long been aware of the full
robustness of the McLaren Vale reds.
Indeed, in my first column in 1962
I chatted about two Hardy’s wines that
were based on Shiraz material from
the area. I have samples of these
wines still, and they are as big and
round and soft and fruity as 'ever.
And early in 1967 I wrote of a
D’Arenburg ’64 Cabernet Shiraz from
Osborne’s that has since improved
wonderfully in the bottle. Today,
Osborne sells more and more of his
own wine under his own label, and he
supplies parcels of reds to Jim’s brain-
child.
McLaren Vale is well suited for
fruit-growing and is particularly suit-
able for grape-growing. The climate is
temperate, with a mild summer and
cool vintage and freedom from frost,
the rainfall is just right at a steady
twenty-odd inches a year. Hell, what
more could you want. As there is
great soil variety, there are different
wine characters from the different
grapes of different vineyards.
The Genders vineyard is on the
heavy soil of the Daringa Swamp,
almost part of the town of McLaren
Vale. The vines are so profuse the
pickers have to reach rather than stoop.
The Dennis vineyards have varying
soil, light and heavy, and are on good
subsoil. His property is north-east
by some three miles of the township.
Sigston is just over the road from
Ryecroft, on heavy red clay that once
carried huge stands of great old red
gums. And “Gid” Brunato has his
vineyards not far from Dennis’, on
sandy loam.
The makers vary, too. Thank heavens
they don’t all think the same way.
Cud Kay from Amery Vineyards is a
very proper gentleman, squiring it
from his bastion with the bright red
roof not far from Seaview. The mag-
nificent stone cellars were built in
the past century by Cud’s father and
uncle. His son, Colin, a Roseworthy
Gold Medallist, is now overseas study-
ing wine-making methods to further
improve the breed. The soil at Amery
varies from biscay to deep sand, with
alluvial soil in the valleys and water-
washed quartz on the ridges with drifts
of shallow sand and a little limestone.
Alex Johnston makes the wine at
Johnston’s Pirramimma winery. He
is the son of Lex and nephew of
Digby, the manager of the cellar.
Their vineyards are just outside the
township and the soils vary from
sandy to rich dark earth on the flat.
I’ve talked of d’Arry Osborne before.
He is the son of yet another wine
doctor, and he has considerably
improved the vineyards and winery in
recent years. He is knowledgeable and
enthusiastic and, I’m told, inclined
toward formality during vintage. He
wears his old dress shirts as wine-
making gear and this is said to give
elegance to his reds.
The recently formed Southern Vale
Wine Co-op is another maker. They
had their first vintage in 1965 under
chairmanship of Wine Board member
Ambrose Tonkin. Neil Lindsay now
makes the wines, which are improving
year after year.
And last, and most, Jim Ingoldby.
He is a dedicated wine-maker and a
serious liver of the full life. He has a
passion for the local dry reds, nitrogen
heads, Bartok, J. J. Hilder, and smooth-
trunked eucalypts. He is a serious water-
color artist and his rambling, gracious
home reflects ‘his wide tastes. He also
has a gorgeous wife. Jim is a cultured
man, whatever that means, a truth
CONNOISSEUR
TABLE WINES
NOTES FROM LINDEMAN'S
CELLAR MANAGER:
One of the most intriguing aspects
of wine making is the effect that
soil, climate and conditions have upon
the flavour and taste of wine made
from a given variety of grapes. The
differences have to be seen, or rath-
er tasted, to be believed, and in
turn give rise to much of the pleas-
ure in wine drinking and of course to
much "winesmanship". One noted auth-
ority has always maintained that dry
red made from Shiraz grapes grown in
the Coonawarra area in the south-east
of South Australia, tastes more like
Cabernet Sauvignon Dry Red than that
made from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes
grown elsewhere in the state.
One of the most popular grape var-
ieties for the production of Dry Red
in Australia is Shiraz, traditionally
called Red Hermitage in the Hunter
River Valley, and as it is grown in
every district affords a good oppor-
tunity to see these effects. Better
of course to see a range of wines
made by the one firm as skills and
techniques vary tremendously between
the different companies.
From the Eden Valley in South
Australia we get very elegant wines
akin to the Coonawarra reds but with-
out the slightly "peppery" Coonawarra
character. A few miles away in the
Barossa,Valley the reds tend to lack
bouquet and flavour, to have a rather
"flat" character, and have a typical
furry-tasting tannin end palate.
At Corowa-Rutherglen in the south-
ern Riverina we make Shiraz dry reds
so black in colour, so full-bodied
and astringent that they are almost
undrinkable for their first ten
years. They tend to have a very
"fruity" bouquet, often likened to
the smell of a derivative of ether.
As well as bottling many of these
wines as straight district wines, we
create very distinctive "Lindeman"
styles by blending certain combina-
tions of districts together.
Foremost of these,our Hunter-
Coonawarra -Clare blend. Last year
we released the 1963 wine Reserve
Claret Bin 2565, and shortly will be
releasing the 1964 wine, Reserve
Claret Bin 2910.
Slightly lower down the scale is
our Bin 45 Claret, the current vin-
tage of which is 1965. Composition
of this blend can change from year
to year, but generally it incorpor-
ates Clare, Coonawarra, Hunter River
Valley, Eden Valley and Langhorne
Creek.

fanatic, and becomes unbearable only
during vintage. His having to keep
separate the various crushings of the
various growers and his own vineyards
with their different characteristics makes
him somewhat schizophrenic at this
time, but the results are worth it.
The results are something. Recently
I tasted two lots of them. Of them all
I liked the Ingoldby making of a
Sigston Shiraz the best. I can’t
remember whether it was a ’64 or
a ’65. It was lighter than most of the
others, with a very good clean fresh
nose and a good fruit flavor. The
balance of the wine was delightful, with
a good tannin and soft acid finish. A
developer, as indeed all the wines are.
The Johnston Pirramimma was clean
and fresh and much fuller. It has a
strong, late-p,cited character about it
w.th even a suggestion of sugar. Th,s
probably comes from the full fruit.
There is a'so a big tannin grip to the
wine This is one of the old style that

is very vinous. A strong smell of the
grape pervades. It is soft and smooth
in the mouth, though it does appear
to be a bit “hollow,” lacking the guts
you would expect from the nose and
flavor. The Cud Kay Amery wine is
interesting, medium-bodied and agree-
able. Dan Murphy, of the Vintage
Club, Melbourne, claimed he detected
a gooseberry taste.
The D’Arenburg ’65 is much bigger.
I liked the flavor of this wine and
thought it most typical of the area. A
big fruity wine, soft and round, with
good balance and without coarseness.
Good drinking now and in ten years’
time for those who enjoy this fuller
tasty style. I asked Dan what he thought
of it. He replied, “Well, it has a highly
spiced or smoky nose, which is almost
candyish at times, perhaps more the
smell of oleander or that of those spicy
perfumed bushes you get in Spain.” He
said it with a straight face, too.
The Dennis/Ingoldby wine I thought
more austere than some of the others.
It was clean and fresh, with a good
tannin finish. Another improver. And
not quite as “generous” as some of the
bigger wines.
I suggest these wines are worthy of
interest. Especially if you like the fuller-
bodied style of red that has so much
flavor. I think it splendid that, in these
days of a levelling standard and of
multi-blends, there are still these
regional wines around. And not at fancy
prices. What interests me even more is
this renaissance of a true regional
style, and, in these days of wine inquiry,
all the information you could wish for.
I see Walter James, the GOM of
Australian wine writers, endorsing an
ad with the comment, “. . . and now
they are flying under their own colors
their merits are bound to command
the respect of discriminating wine
lovers.” I am happy to agree.
Letters
The backbench revolt
The recent discussions in Parliament on
defence and the attitude of the Prime
Minister, who did not even add his
voice to this all-important debate (8.,
May 18), deserve further comment. The
argument that we should replace the
old Menzies-inspired “forward defence”
by a withdrawal within our borders,
maintaining mobile forces to be
utilised wherever required, must once
and for all be exploded as a complete
myth. What we must plan for is the
collective security of the whole area
in South-East Asia, including with Aus-
tralia its neighboring nations, so as to
ensure a peaceful development. This
does not mean either a simple garrison
in another country placed there to
watch only Australian security, nor does
it mean the building of a “fortress” un-
concerned with a continuous defence
policy of countries whose survival as
free nations is vital to Australia. It
would appear that the only measure
which Australia is adopting with great
fortitude at the moment is the build-
ing of a tariff wall around our con-
tinent.
We therefore most strongly support
those men in Parliament who are pre-
pared to risk their political future in
opposing their own Party leader’s
leisurely approach to our immediate
defence problems. John Jess, Harry
Turner, Geoff Bate, Edward St. John,
Don Chipp, and Peter Howson are cer-
tainly accepting their responsibility of
realistic thinking in terms of develop-
ment with safety (and it would be
remiss not to add to this group the voice
of Captain Sam Benson). They have
shown their deep concern at what
might be the result if the Government
continues with its fallacious policy of
delay and its hypocritical contention
that we in Australia can place develop-
ment before security at all times.

Wool communes
In a grey world as far as the woolgrower
is concerned, your article “The Right
Size for Rural Holdings” (8., May 18)
was a brilliant shaft of sunshine. The
National Council of Woolselling
Brokers’ concept of wool villages is only
beaten at the post by Mr. Curtis’ keen
advocation of wool communes.
Why on earth has nobody thought of
this before? In fact, why hasn’t the
concept already been seized by the Gov-
ernment? After all, as Mr. Curtis so
convincingly points out, the only alter-
native for the unhappy landholder is
“to lose his vocation, his land, and his
freedom of operation.”
The logical steps for governmental
initiation of the whole idea are quite

simple. To set the ball rolling it would
be necessary to order a large number of
Barn Doors, in the Orwellian tradition,
for allocation to each of the proposed
communes. Barn Doors are so very
much a part of commune life. Whether
they are actually attached to Barns, on
the other hand, is quite beside the point,
for their purpose would be not so much
to open or shut as to bear the necessary
slogans. These would need careful
thought, but we coudn’t go far wrong
with that most classical of all commune
slogans, “All woolgrowers are equal,
but some are more equal than others.”
With such a lead, how could the
scheme fail? Woolgrowers, tired of the
thankless effort of producing over 30
percent of Australia’s exports, dis-
heartened by the enormous burden of a
lopsided cost structure, demoralised by
the insistence that their economic con-
tribution by no means entitles them to
adequate political representation (“one
vote one value” is so much more demo-
cratic), would fall over each other to
enter into the spirit of the thing. The
odd reactionary who had the temerity
to Suggest that the adoption of realistic
economic policies could lower the cost
structure would have to lump it.

Expatriate view
If you can’t give Britain a “fair go”
you should leave the subject alone
altogether. It appears that the only way
Australia can become an independent
republic is to belittle and decry dis-
honestly the country from where she
originated and from whom many of
our customs and laws are derived.

Kangaroos' "protection"
I have been following letters which
have appeared lately in The Bulletin,
and I would like to add my comment:
According to a CSIRO Report (1967)
populations of kangaroos in Western
N.S.W. had declined by more than half,
and “in some areas the kangaroo has
been virtually wiped out,”
The “big dry” has resulted in thous-
ands of kangaroos perishing through
lack of food, and breeding also has been
severely restricted (increasing mortality
of “joeys” until none survived and
females ceased to breed).
During this calamitous period these
supposedly protected animals were most
vulnerable to the shooters’ guns, as they
were driven out of their natural habitats
in search of food.
Business as usual no closed season
for the roo, or even any talk of stop-
ping the shooting in areas where they
have been virtually wiped out.
