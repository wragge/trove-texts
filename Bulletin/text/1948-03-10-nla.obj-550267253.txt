FAMOUS SCOTTISH SUMMER RESORT IS BALLATER ON THE DEE
River Dee provides many a bonnie view as you
travel by train from Dundee to Ballater, where the railway
ends. This modern little town has some fine buildings, shops and
private houses, as well as three comfortable hotels. The town was
founded in 1770 to provide accommodation for visitors to the
well-known Pannanich medicinal springs, but it has continued to
gain popularity as a summer resort by reason of its own attrac-
tions. Busy all summer, Ballater becomes extremely fashionable
when Royalty is at nearby Balmoral Castle. Here at Ballater the
surrounding mountains provide varied and interesting scenery.
There is cone-shaped Craigepdarrock, the magnificent height of
Lochnager, often snow-capped; and “Big Nose” Morven, a pro-
digious monarch of the north. As well as Balmoral, the Ballater
district is famous for its Cairn of Remembrance, a memorial of
the Clan Farquharson, Here was the meeting place of the clansmen
on their way to battle and the disbanding place when homeward
bound. Each of those who assembled gave a stone to the cairn:'
each who returned took a stone from it, and usually a sorry pile
of stones was left to show how many clansmen had not
returned.

G IDE IN A MIRROR.
“To me,” wrote Andre Gide in his
diary, “the world is a mirror, and I am
amazed when it gives a bad reflection of
me.” That sentence might be taken as a
summary of the whole of the first volume
of the diary, which, translated and edited
by Justin O’Brien, has been published in
a handsome format by Seeker and War-
burg under the title of The Journals of
Andre Gide: Volume 1, 1889-1913 :it is
a mirror reflecting Gide.
True, Gide is not the only figure to be
seen in the shimmering glass of his prose.
His collected works today running to
more than 15 volumes —poems, plays,
novels, criticism, travel —he began his
literary life in the Paris of the ’Nineties,
among the symbolists, aesthetes and de-
cadents whose English representatives
were Wilde and Symons and Beardsley
and the early Yeats, whose Australian
representative was Christopher Brennan,
and who were led in Paris by Mallarme.
Some of the members of the Parisian
circle come to life in Gide’s pages.
D’Annunzio, for instance:
Toother we go to the Gambrinus;
d’Annunzio indulges with obvious greediness
in little vanilla ices served in small card-
board boxes. He sits beside me and talks
gracefully and charmingly without, it seems
to me, paying any special attention to" the
role he is playing. He is short; from a
distance his face would seem ordinary or
already familiar, so devoid is he of any
exterior sign of literature or genius. He
wears a little pointed beard which is pale
blond and talks with a clearly articulated
voice, somewhat cold, but supple and
almost caressing. His eyes are rather cold;
he is perhaps rather cruel, but perhaps
it is simply the appearance of his delicate
sensuality that makes him seem so. He is
wearing a black derby, quite unaffectedly.
Ibsen displeases him by “his lack of
beauty.” “What do you expect?” he said
as if to excuse himself; “I am a Latin.”
There are glimpses of Degas, the great
painter scornfully criticising the twilight
of the impressionist movement —“Degas
said, in front of Besnard’s ‘Arab Stable’
(a large painting in which a horse, in the
foreground, is rearing up, throwing on
the ground a strangely purple shadow),
‘Do you know why the horse is rearing?
Because of the purple! ’ ” ; of Rodin, in-
furiating Matisse by telling him to “fuss”
over his drawings for a fortnight and
then bring them back to him; of Leon
Blum—“Oh, if politics did not bend all
his thoughts, what a keen critic he would
be. But he judges things and people ac-
cording to his opmions and not accord-
ing to his taste” ; of the sculptor Nadel-
man, who “draws with a compass and
sculps by assembling rhombs” and whose
art, Gide says, would probably appeal
to Leo Stein (Gertrude’s brother, and “a
great buyer of Matisses”) “because it is
only a technique, and rudimentary at
that, and it can be grasped without
effort” ; glimpses of scores of poets and
artists, rogues, fakes and bohemians,
ranging from the dignity of the d’An-
nunzio sketch to the amusing story of
the scoundrel who had two women to
support him, living with one by day and
the other by night, or the satirical de-
nunciation of the “pig” named Victor:
Very pleasant dinner, like all the dinners
at the charming R.N.’s house; with a fat
idiot whom I had already met through
Rouart and who is named— L no one knows
why—Victor. His outthrust jaw prolonged
by a sort of goatee makes him look as if
he had just come down from the iEgina
pediment. He grits'his teeth and clenches
his fists as he talks; he impresses himself
as a wild man and puts frenzy into his
utterance of the most stupid aphorisms.
He says: “Catholicism has made of this
world a vast hollow top.” And this pig
is a painter. He paints on wood because
ms frantic brush-strokes would go right
through the canvas. With this detail I
leave him.
But in spite of such flashes of anima-
tion The Journals of A ndre Gide is not a
book of portraits. Too often—astonish-
mgly often —there is merely a mention of
some celebrity, no attempt to describe
him. If the picture of d’Annunzio shows
the author at his best in this respect, the
note on Sickert—“Yesterday at Dieppe
with Henri Gheon saw Walter Sickert
again. He said to me: ‘Do you remem-
ber the first time you met me you asked:
T hope it doesn’t annoy you that I like
your painting’?”—just that and nothing
more shows Gide at his least interest-
ing; and this bare jotting, the raw
material for a book, in no respect ready
for publication, is typical of Gide’s por-
traiture as a whole.
For those who like to watch a writer’s
mind at work, and who have a special
interest in this author, the rough notes
may have their appeal; but it is, at best,
a negative kind of value. For another
instance, there is Gide’s account of a
banquet for Edmund Gosse, from which
he emerges with a fragment of conversa-
tion between Maeterlinck and Verhaeren,
but with no picture of the scene, and of
Gosse not a word. In the whole volume
there is no pen-portrait of Mallarme:
whatever else the journal may be, it is
not, as one would hope and expect, a
satisfying picture of a generation. Essen-
tially, there is only one face in the
mirror: Gide’s.
The same bareness, the same sketchi-
ness, the same emptiness reduces the in-
terest of the book in other ways where a
rich and full statement might be expected.
In the travel notes, for instance. Gide
visits Tunis and, enchanted with negroes
and jasmine—the worship of the primi-
tive and the luxurious that was inspired
by the satanism of Baudelaire —becomes
himself enchanting in that vaguely de-
cadent manner:
I also sought in vain that dark cafe
■where the only inhabitants were tall negroes
from the Sudan. Some of them had their
bit toe cut as a sign of slavery. Most of
them wore, stuck in their turban, a little
sprig of white flowers, of fragrant jasmine,
which intoxicates them; it falls along the
cheek like a curl of the romantic epoch
and gives their faces an expression of
voluptuous languor. They like the odor
of flowers to such an extent that often, not
able to smell them strongly enough, they
insert the crushed petals in their nostrils.
In that cafe one of them would sing,
another would tell stories, and tame doves
would fly about and perch on their
shoulders.
The paragraph—and, scattered through
the book, set in Tunis, or France, or Italy,
or Spain, there are hundreds like it —is a
little prose-poem, something that might
have been written by Baudelaire himself,
or by Verlaine. But everything is brief,
patchy, disjointed. There is no coherent
narrative of Gide’s travels, but only notes
for his travel books, beautiful in a
precious way, interesting and irritating.
There are not cities and countrysides in
the book but, too obviously, cities and
countrysides filtered through, the mind
of Gide: “I have found the sedret of my
boredom in Rome: Ido not find myself
interesting here.”
It is the same again with Gide’s ac-
count of his reading and his criticisms of
literature, art and music. He says of
Wagner, “Germany has never produced
anything at once so great and so bar-
barous” ; and that, whether or not one
agrees with it,*is at least something defi-
nite. Again, and admirably, on Upton
Sinclair: “Read yesterday Upton Sin-
clair’s King Midas; very bad, quite out-
side literature.” ,
\yith a similar distinctness we find him
admiring the naturalist Fabre; “dazed
with intoxication” at the “ardent and
magnificent” poetry of Marlowe and find-
ing Keats “almost cold and colorless”
beside the Elizabethan; going to “Mac-
beth” and “Hamlet” when he wishes to
illustrate the perfection of literary form ;
interested in Dickens and Thackeray and
Conrad and Stevenson; studying “the
great figure of Byron” and “reading Car-
lyle, who annoys me and awakens my
enthusiasm at one and the same time”;
criticising the opening of Madame
Bovary as “very badly written” and de-
fending Salammbo against realistic
critics on the ground that Flaubert was
seeking for an image of antiquity rather
than trying to record facts —“Through
loathing for everyday reality he fell in
love here with everything different from
it.” We find him in youth—and a most
salutary process it would have been for
all the writers of the ’Nineties—wanting
to dry up his heart (“ ‘Sear’ is a better
word”) and read “the vigorous writers,
and especially the most virile: Aristo-
phanes, Shakspeare, Rabelais” ; and we
find him “Closeted in the greenhouse with
Goethe’s poems, surrounded by golden-
yellow calceolarias, without fever, with-
out anxieties, without desires” and en-
joying “perfect felicity.” But we also
find him writing, “Reflected at very great
length on what art criticism can be (and
especially on what it cannot be)”—with-
out supplying for the reader one word of
these impressive cogitations. We find
him saying that Walter Pater does not
give him what he requires from English
writing, but not adding what his require-
ments are. Time and again we have the
bare list of his reading, without com-
ment. And the definite critical opinions,
impressive enough when picked out and
listed, are rare and minute in the mass of
the book. Concerning Gide’s own works
there is practically nothing.
Essentially, then, the journal is Gide in
a mirror. For his personal appearance in
the glass one has to turn to Justin
O’Brien’s admirable foreword:
. A tall, well-built youth, Andre Gide was
inordinately austere and painfully shy. His
upbringing had developed in him an ex-
cessive sensitivity and feminine grace. His
hair fell below his ears, almost touching
his stiff collar; his cheeks were covered
; with a soft down that was soon to become
a full beard. Hypnotised by his keen dark
eyes, everyone except Oscar Wilde failed
to notice his full sensual lips and fine
aquiline nose. He dressed with a some-
what antiquated elegance, preferring soft,
flowing bow ties, a loose cape and a
broad-brimmed soft hat.
But, for the picture of the mind behind
the eye?. The Journals of Andre
'■ Gide is, in the opening chapters and, say,
foi( the first half of the volume, remark-
able ; brilliant; extraordinarily effective
as a piece of self-portraiture, at once self-
conscious and guileless.
Gide —and this is why he is not a great
diarist —was never off-guard ; he seems
to have had the notion of publication
always in his mind and, even when he is
confessing such conceivably embarras-
sing matters as his early puritanism, his
struggle to “force myself towards joy,”
his period of libertinage and his little
vanities and humiliations, he obviously
watched every word he wrote. With
meticulous care he was building up a
“portrait of the artist as a young man.”
But this process, cautious as it was, had
its own guilelessness: only a very young
writer, and a writer of the ’Nineties,
would have written his autobiography in
that modulated style, with those frag-
mentary profundities, with those Mal-
larmd-like omissions and silences, with
that contempt for almost everything ex-
cept the life of the mind —chiefly the
author’s own mind—and with that un-
varying belief in the importance of his
most trivial utterance.
So, in those opening chapters, we have
Gride as he chose to present himsplf in
his mirror and, beyond that, the uncon-
scious revelation of Gide as a young
writer. Allowing for minor differences of
place and time and fashion, he is any
young writer; and he is amusing, he is
tragic and he is sublime. He looks down
upon Paris from a hilltop and shouts with
Balzac’s Rastignac, “And now . . . you
and I come to grips!” He cries out in
rage against the people who cannot tell,
merely from the look in his eyes, the
great works he is going to produce. He
makes rule after rule to force himself to
work, warning himself of the necessity
for solitude and the danger of talking
about books yet unwritten. He decides
that he has “voluntarily and fatally con-
secrated himself, unto damnation, for the
sake of others; in order to manifest.”
He finds, in youthful melancholy,
against which he has made a sacred vow,
that the whole landscape assumes “the
color of my lamentable soul.” Search-
ing for a truth to replace his early
puritanism, he runs from philosopher to
philosopher, believes he has discovered
the secret of the universe, then cries “But,
after all, what does all this matter! !?”
He is appalled, unable to write, for fear
of net being wholly sincere. He longs, he
prays, to “want only one thing, and to
want it constantly.” He asks in despair
“Could anyone love me?” He attacks
bullfighting on the ground that the bull,
being enraged, is killed “in a state of
mortal sin.” He decides that his room,
as an aid to composition, must be decor-
ated with death-masks. He writes, “Woe to
him who thinks of his personality while
writing.” He meets, in perfect serious-
ness, others in his own state of rebellion,
ambition, torment and comicality:
After lunch the young Roberto Gatteschi
comes to call and we go out together. He
tells me of the novels he plans to write
and talks very intelligently about them.
It is to be a series forming a cycle in
which he will defend crime. The first will
defend (or at least will relate)-incest; the
second, murder; the third, theft.
It is a remarkable picture, but (all
praise of The Journals of Andre Gide
must be qualified by a “but”) it fades out.
Gide, says Justin O’Brien, shaved his
beard. With it, as far as this book is
concerned, he removed all color of per-
sonality. In the second half of the book
he is neutral. One learns a little about
Other men from him, a good deal about
other men’s opinions on art and litera-
ture in the form of aphorisms—Goethe’s
noble observation, for instance, that “The
tremor of awe is the best in man”—but
about Gide himself hardly anything. It
is with difficulty that one recalls he has
written many books; it is with absolute
astonishment one realises that, towards
the end of the volume, he has reached
the age of 45. If he has lived he has not
lived in this book. He has learned to
guard himself too well. His whole life,
too faithfully fulfilling a Mallarmean
principle, “fades into whiteness”; int 6
vacuity.
The journals, first published in France
in 1940, are regarded, say the publishers,
as Gide’s “cardinal work.” The two
volumes to follow the present instalment
may do something to correct the general
impression it leaves of a tantalising
scrappiness. But if it is fair to take the
great Sam Pepys as a model and a
standard for diarists, Gide, so far, though
by no means lacking in merit, is com-
paratively thin and hollow. There is too
much of the dilettante about this book.
Conducting a Massacre.
The ballad as a verse form is essen-
tially lyrical. It was, in its primitive hey-
day, verse with a purpose. It was the
medium of simple people with simple
hates to vent or ends to serve. It needed
to be in a form easy to memorise and to
sing, with suitable variations, while drunk
and in a mood to dance by a campfire or
at a feast. It was. a product of the
tongue rather than of the pen, and this
is why the ruder peoples usually pro-
duce the best ballads. Occasionally, how-
ever, as in Douglas Stewart’s Glencoe
(Angus and Robertson), a (presumably)
civilised man makes a good fist at
balladry.
The ballad, -if not originally Celtic,
should have been. Some of the best bal-
lads are in the purest Erse, or in Ger-
man. Any writer who is forced to pro-
duce his ballads in the namby-pamby
tongue of the Sassenach, which is too
precise and gentlemanly for the bar-
barous emanations of an unjust
indignation, is at a grave disad-
vantage beside bards of rougher
northern lands. Mr. Stewart has all the
qualities and feelings which go to make
a sound baliadist, including a completely
partisan outlook, and one feels that if
he had written in Gaelic his result, excel-
lent as it is in English, would have been
superlative. In Erse even a lovelorn
lament sounds like this:
Siubhail go soccair, agus subhail go ciuin,
Siubhail, go d-ti an doras agus eulaigh Horn,
Is go d-teidh tu, a mhuirnain! slan.
So it is easy to understand what could
be done with a really good massacre like
Glencoe if the means were available.
Mr. Stewart, of course, is not only
imbued with all the characteristics of per-
sons who derive from the Scotland of the
Stewarts. Much as he personally re-
sembles the young Charles-the-Martyr
(before the latter affected a beard), one
feels that at some stage his ancestral
genes must have become a little mixed,
with the result that he partakes more of
the viewpoint of the sennachie of the
Western Islands than of that of the
Stewart Court Poet. It would 'be far
easier to imagine him dancing round a
peat fire, a hunk of dripping Campbell
cow-meat in one hand and a queigh of
uisgebeatha in the other, yelling musical
objurgations at Clan Alpine than it would
be to picture him framing poisonous
nothings in Holyrood,
His balladry has something of the
rude roar of the torrent of the glen, the
authentic surge which warns prosody to
get out of the way or be run over. While
reading him one at times reaches for a
handkerchief to wipe away the spray of
Celtic vehemence which carries the author
through 16 solid ballads in about 14
different verse-forms, without any abate-
ment of picturesqueness or of the fresh-
ness of his sense of outrage at what the
Campbells and the Dalrymples did to the
Maclans.
There are no half-measures about Mr.
Stewart. Like all Highland poets he is
obviously a thorough hater and, what is
more to the point in a baliadist, a con-
vincing one.
“Dutch Kings,” Dalrymples (“like a fat
little bird in a blackberry clump”),
Campbells of Glenlyon and Breadalbane—
Mr. Stewart seems as if he writes with
hard feeling for all of them, as if they
were much-disliked contemporaries. As
for the Maclans, that turbulent, sheep-
stealing, rock-hopping little tribe of rob-
bers of the glen, he makes them sound
almost attractive and civilised, and cer-
tainly puts them under a new obligation
to Scottish poesy, to which their
memories owe so much already—to
which, indeed; they owe almost as much
as they do to King William for being
Dutch.
Had His Majesty not beep Dutch, and
had he not been served by Campbells
and Lowlanders, the chances are that the
epitaph of the Maclans would have been
no more than a shrugging of the shoul-
ders and the muttered “good riddance,”
which had greeted similar immolations
of inconvenient robber bands— men,
women and animals complete—through-
out the ages in the Highlands and the
Islands.
No Caledonian whose ancestors were
saved by the Campbells from being cut
to pieces by M‘Neills or Macraes should
fail to whet his dislike* of the “false and
fair” on Mr. Stewart’s easily-running
commentary on the cowards of Argyll
and their naughtinesses :
Kintyre was ours and the Campbells took
it, Islay, lona and all,
From Awe to Tay ye beggared your neigh-
bors, robbed them by fraud and
guile
Indeed, a diverting exercise for Cale-
donian gatherings should be the recita-
tion of Mr, Stewart’s ballads by 1?
representatives of the clans —one ballad
per man —taken at random. This would
be far more exciting than ice hockey or
League football if the wrong clansmen
got the wrong bits.

How did the sugar industry originate

In 1823 Thomas Scott made 80
tons of sugar at Port Macquarie

two years old. Interest lapsed, and
not until 1847 were experiments re-
sumed —in the Brisbane Valley, More-
ton Bay district. M. Buhot was the
first to manufacture from Queens-
land-grown cane, which he obtained
from the Brisbane Botanical Gardens.
Louis Hope put the industry on a
commercial basis. In 1863-64, in
the Moreton Bay district, he had 20
acres under cane; he introduced
kanaka labor in 1864. That year the
Queensland Acclimatisation Society
began importing new cane varieties,
and sugar companies were formed in
Brisbane, Maryborough and at Mac-
kay, where John Spiller planted the
first cane. In 1865, 141 acres were
under cane. , Louis Hope received a
land grant in 1867 for his work. In
Queensland by 1869, 5000 acres were
under cane and there were 28 mills.

The oil was applied too thickly.
Clean leather carefully with a damp

rub in gently a trace of sweet oil,
afterwards polishing. Never oil
leather heavily—use a little and rub

General Information on Norfolk
Island ?
This island is about 930 miles
e.-n.-e. of Sydney and 400 miles
n.-w. of New Zealand. Five miles
long by three wide, it was discovered
by Cook in 1774. Its area is 8528
acres and circumference 20 miles. Tire
climate is mild with a mean tem-
perature of 68 degrees and an annual
rainfall of 53in. Descendants of
Bounty mutineers were brought there
in 1856. The chief town is Kingston,
and the island’s population on June
30, 1944, was 749.

formation on growing it from seeds?
(1) Little success obtained from cut-
tings, but try using pieces of last
year’s wood (about 6in. long), setting
them at an angle of 45deg. in the
soil. (2) Good results are usually
obtained from seed (round, well-
dried and brown) sown in a mixture
of sandy loam, wood ash and decayed
leaf-mould. Water only sufficiently
to keep the soil moist.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
A MODERN GENERAL.
A “Christian Science Moni-
tor” reviewer of American
General George S. Patton’s War
as I Knew It speaks of Patton’s
“extreme impetuosity, which
made him difficult for the high
command to handle,” and his
“intemperate braggadocio, which
was disgusting to many of his
soldiers.”
Patton, on his own writings
(including his frank letters home
to a friend, published in the
“Atlantic Monthly”), evidently
had a violent prejudice against
Montgomery (not that he had
this on his own ; feeling among
the commanders wasn’t all
sweetness, as censorship made
it appear);
Bradley called to say that Monty
wanted aH the American troops to
stop, so that he, Monty, could make
a “dagger-thrust with the 21st Army
Group at the heart of Germany.”
Bradley said he thought it would be
more like a “butter-knife thrust.”
As his writings thoroughly
confirm, fatten wasn’t a parlor
piece. He was tough. He’d have
made a great infantry leader at
any time. “All my life,” he says
in one of his letters, “I have
wanted to lead men in desperate
battle ;I am going to do it; and
at fifty-six one can go with equa-
nimity—there is nothing much
one has not done.” He refers
to the possibility that one attack
might be a pushover: “Per-
sonally I would rather have a
fight—it would be good prac-
tice.”
Regarding the much-publi-
cised occasion when he slapped
a U.S. soldier at a hospital,
Patton’s account is that he saw
the soldier, a “hysterical case,”
sitting on a bed near a dressing
station:
I stopped and said to him “What
is the matter, boy?” He said
“Nothing. I just can’t take it.” I
asked what he meant. He said “I
just can’t take being shot at.” I
said “You mean that you are
malingering here?” He burst into
tears and I immediately saw that he
was a hysterical case. I, therefore,
slapped him across the face with my
glove and told him to get up, join his
unit and make a man of himself,
which he did. Actually, at that time
he was absent without leave.
I am convinced that my action
in this case was entirely correct, and
that, had other officers had the cour-
age to do likewise, the shameful use
of “battle fatigue” as an excuse for
cowardice would have been infinitely
reduced. The greatest weapon against
so-called battle fatigue is ridicule.
There were other occasions
when, if those under him may
have thought him “disgusting,”
he was just as disgusted with
them. In his book he tells of
taking over some new forces in
France; —
I visited the troops near Coutances
and found an armored division sitting
on a road, while its headquarters,
secreted behind an old church, was
deeply engrossed in the study of
maps. I asked why they had not
crossed the Sienne. They told me
they were making a study of it at
the moment, but could not find a
place where it could be forded. I
asked what effort they had made to
find such a place, and was informed
that they were studying the map to
that end. I then told them I had
just waded across it, that it was
not over two feet deep, and that the
only defence I knew about was one
machine-gun, which had fired very
inaccurately at me. I repeated the
Japanese proverb: “One look is
worth one hundred reports,” and
asked them why in hell they had not
gone down to the river personally.
They learned the lesson, and from
then on were a very great division.
Another glimpse of the war in
France (and of himself) from
the book:
The first Sunday I spent in Nor-
mandy was quite impressive. I went
to a Catholic Field Mass where all
of us were armed. As we knelt in
the mud in the slight drizzle, we
could distinctly hear the roar of me
guns, and the whole sky was filled
with airplanes on their missions or
| destruction . . . quite at variance with
: the teachings of the religion we were
practising.
I I shall always remember very un-
pleasantly the time spent in the apple-
| orchard, because I was obsessed with
the belief that the war would end
; before I got into it.
j He also touches on the re-
! ligious aspect in one of his
letters from Sicily:
I This morning I went to the Epis-
copal Church and for the first time
in my life found it crowded with
American soldiers and sailors. I had
very strange feelings in watching the
faces and types of men who went to
Communion... .It was a very strange
mixture. Whether it is faith or super-
stition I do not know, but certainly it
comes out in war and is coming out
faster all the time.
I had all the non-Catholic chaplains
in the other day and gave them hell
for having uninteresting services. I
am convinced that man does not want
to be preached to on the Divinity of
Christ or the efficacy of prayer—
certainly not preached to for half an
hour. I told them that I was going
to relieve any preacher who talked
more than 10 minutes on any sub-
ject. I will probably get slapped
down by the Church Union, but I
am absolutely right.
A sentence from his book
may come in the same category:
“Christmas dawned clear and
cold; lovely weather for killing
Germans, although the thought
seemed somewhat at variance
with the spirit of the day.”
One no doubt to be numbered
among those who found him
quite “disgusting” figures in
another of his letters (like all of
these, it says much about Pat-
ton) :
I had a nice legal question this
afternoon: Is a nurse guilty of con-
duct prejudicial to good order of
military discipline if she has a baby
in the theatre of war, said baby
appearing in & time insufficient to
have been developed outside the con-
tinental limits of the U.S.? My
point is that being in such a. condition
she had no business coming to war
and I am going to try her.
In another letter he refers to
art Arab who took a potshot at
him on the Sidi-bou-Zid road:
“An Arab jlist missed me —un-
fortunately, I missed him." The
Patton touch may be different
from the Nelson touch, but it’s
distinctively Patton (Nelson,
too, was tough enough). From
one of the letters:
I killed a huge pig recently. He
was within 20 feet of me, coming
straight on jvhen I hit him. He fell
on my right foot, but was stone-
dead. These expanding slugs are
bad stuff. I should like to hit a
man with one.
In another of the letters he
is asking his friend in the U.S.
to send him a certain excep-
tionally hard-hitting revolver:
“It is quite essential here at
least to always go armed be-
cause, while people have not
shot at me, except twice, there
is always a chance....”
The Patton touch in one of
the letters on the fighting
towards the end: “The few re-
maining Metz forts are sur-
rendering due to lack of salt,
lack of water and lack of guts.”
The only quality Patton found
lacking in the American soldier
—he’d have found it lacking in
Diggers, too —was that of being
a fanatic:
This is a big disadvantage to us as
we are fighting fanatics.
I a,m trying to think of some
method analogous to the one Crom-
well used when he created the new
model army, of making our men
more fanatical.
As an example, some of our
engineers brought me in an Arab and
a burro. The burro had panniers full
of German mines and covered with
a little grass. I asked them why
they hadn’t buried him. They said
that he was still alive. I said “Well,
go ahead and bury him,” but they
said “General, he is alive.” “Well,”
I said, “that can be corrected.” It
probably was. But when you think
these men were being blown up by a
dirty skunk like that and they showed
no animosity against him, it is very
interesting.
Regarding one other element
of the soldier’s existence —his
concern with death Patton
often wrote as if confident;
“If you read in the papers that
I have been killed wait till you
get a War Department confirma-
tion, because I have a great
many 1ive5....., ” Other refer-
ences, however, give a different
impression, making the rest
sound all the more like bravado
(before the war Patton was keen
on steeplechase-riding and fox-
hunting) :
If we should not meet again until
we get to the other side, I am
assured on credible authority that the
heavenly foxes are fast, the heavenly
hounds keen, the fog-bank fences high
and soft, and the landings firm. The
horses of the sun have always been
celebrated. “Whoop Ho! for a kill
in the open!”
There are a good many such
references in his letters, includ-
ing one bearing on the Ameri-
can practice of taking the war
dead back for burial in the
U.S.;
If I should conk, I do not wish
to be disinterred after the war. It
would be more pleasant to my ghostly
future to lie among my soldiers than
to rest in the sanctimonious precincts
of a civilian cemetery.
Patton did not get back. He
was killed in a car accident after
the fighting.
Bizonia’s Government.
Since February 24 the com-
bined U.S.-British zones in Ger-
many have been under what is
near enough to a German Gov-
ernment, though called an Eco-
nomic Administration and act-
ing under certain controls.
Its structure is: (1) An Eco-
nomic Council of 104 members
(Lower House) and a 16-mem-
ber Council of States (Upper
House) elected by the State Gov-
ernments ; (2) an Executive
Committee of six (Cabinet)
elected by the Economic Coun-
cil ; (3) a High Court for the
Combined Area (Supreme
Court), with an Attorney-
General attached to it.
Though confined to the eco-
nomic field, the new Administra-
tion’s powers—“in a wrecked
land where transportation, food
distribution and finances are of
the most urgent concern,” as
N. Y. “Times” puts it —are very
great. There is “the form, if
not the name, of a political
regime,” and it simply means
that Western Germany has now
become “a unified entity which
is to be fitted into the European
Recovery Programme,” as soon
as this is endorsed by the U.S.
Congress.
It also means the divided
Germany which earlier articles
in “Uncabled Additions” indi-
cated as certain ; and that, of
course, means in turn that U.S.-
Britain —with France most prob-
ably joining them —are going
ahead on the lines they said they
would follow as an answer to
continued Soviet non-co-opera-
tion.
Russia is now left to make
what it can of mostly agricul-
tural Eastern Germany. Bizonia
—to be changed to Trizonia
when France joins in—has a
population of well over
40,000,000 and “an economy
that is capable of producing as
much as England and France
combined.”
Antarctic Claims.
In a prose style as chilly as
the regions it deals with, Lon-
don “Times” has editorially
commented on the Argentinian
“attempt to establish meteoro-
logical installations on British
soil in the South Shetland
Islands,” in the sector which,
reaching to the South Pole, is
known to Britain as the Falk-
land Islands Dependencies:
There is a long-standing dispute
between Britain and Argentina over
the sovereignty of the Falkland
Islands themselves, whose British
Governor has responsibility for the*
Dependencies. Between 1820 and
1833 the Republic of Buenos Aires
attempted to occupy them as suc-
cessor in title to the King of Spain,
who had, however, resigned his claim
by convention with Great Britain in
1771. Although Buenos Aires
eventually withdrew under pressure,
its claim was never formally re-
nounced, and has been revived by
Argentina since the war. The De-
pendencies are, apparently, not
claimed as part of the Falklands
group, but rather according to the
theory that sovereignty over Antarctic
territory attaches to the nearest con-
tinental Power within the same limits
of longitude. But Britain had
annexed the Dependencies in 1908,
with the immediate pbject of pre-
venting the extermination of the fur-
bearing seal, and in' virtue of the
generally recognised title deriving
from the systematic exploration of
new lands. Here as elsewhere in the
international opening-up of the Ant-
arctic the British share has been pre-
dominant.
The “Times,” pointing out
that the main interest of all
nations in the Antarctic is
scientific, contends that “it
should be possible for them to
collaborate without raising terri-
torial controversies,” and men-
tions as “an excellent example
of the right spirit in that line”
British-U.S. collaboration in the
same quarter last year, Also
last year, however, the Buenos
Aires Government “refused the
offer of hospitality for an Argen-
tine expedition to British An-
tarctic territory on the ground
of their own alleged sovereignty
there.” On that Argentinian
stand —and, in fact, the whole
dispute—the “Times” frigidly
comments:
It will be unfortunate if persistence
in this claim prevents Argentina from
obtaining such reasonable access for
legitimate scientific purposes to sites
under the British flag as should be
capable of friendly negotiation. Even
apart from the possible bearing that
a precedent now created might have
upon the larger dispute over the Falk-
land Islands themselves, a claim
having so little foundation in history
or law cannot on principle be sup-
ported.
Discussion of the affair in the
House of Commons has been
just as frigid. There the re-
sponsible Minister, mentioning
the British offer to have the dis-
pute referred to the International
Court, said: “This offer has been
rejected by both [Argentine and
Chilean] Governments, and we
can only regard this as evidence
that they have no confidence in
their ability to dispute our legal
title.”
As for more violent disputa-
tion, a member of the Opposi-
tion asked: “Will the Minister
bear in mind that in the past,
when the Royal Navy was kept
at a proper strength, action
would have been taken long be-
fore this?” To which the
Minister replied: “I have no
doubt action of that kind will be
effectively attended to, but there
are many other methods of
settling international disputes.”
Impartial British.
“The best evidence that the
British are being reasonably im-
partial in Palestine,” a N. Y.
“Times” correspondent there re-
ports, “is that each side con-
tinues to accuse them vehemently
of favoring the other side.”
The correspondent refers to
the British having had to send
troops into action against the
Arabs, “and whenever it be-
comes evident that they must do
so to prevent massacre,, they do
not hesitate to do it. The Arab
press then berates them as hypo-
crites who talk against partition
while helping to make it effec-
tive.”
On the other hand, “When
they find Jews with arms the
British confiscate the arms’.
Though the British have been
lenient in arms cases since the
partition vote in offering fines
as an alternative to prison, the
Zionists accuse them of disarm-
ing Jews but not Arabs.”
The correspondent states only
half the fact in commenting that
“The British opposed partition
because they did not wish to
offend the Arabs, who refused to
agree to it.” However, he
amends that by another com-
ment which gets to the crux of
the whole matter: “Long experi-
ence in Palestine has taught them
[the British] that any settlement
that the Arabs do not accept
will cost” a heavy price in blood
and money to enforce, if, in-
. deed, it can be enforced.” '
After Stalin.
One often unconsidered trifle
in speculations on future Soviet
moves is the uncertainty of what
may happen in Russia on the
passing of Stalin.
Few are prepared to predict a
smooth transition: a mere as-
you-were, with a fresh dictator
hoisted into Joe’s shoes. Many
expect a violent struggle within
the party ranks.
In the view of N. Y. “Times’s”
chief European correspondent,
C. L. Sulzberger, “it is obvious
that there cannot be any single
Soviet leader who could com-
pletely succeed Stalin in either
position or stature.” As to that,
however, it would seem in the
nature of dictatorships that any-
one who could fully succeed to
the position would only have to
be ruthless enough to be sure,
in due course, of the stature.
The N. Y. “Times” corre-
spondent expects, rather, that a
“triumvirate or quadrumvirate
of leaders would assume control
of the functions of the Soviet
State under the continuing oyer-
all direction of the Politburo,”
an arrangement that would seem
to carry its own seeds of a speedy
and violent end.
While any such arrangement
did last, the correspondent
quotes “most diplomats and ob-
servers” as thinking its formal
chief would be Molotov, who
“appears without doubt to be
second only to Stalin in the
propaganda carefully fostered by
the Communist apparatus.”
Working with him, “but by no
means under Molotov,” would
be Zhdanov, who “has probably
greater authority and influence
in the secret party-controlling
apparatus and is known to be
close to Stalin.” The next of
importance listed are Beria and
Malenkov. “It is certain that a
Russian and not a member of
another Soviet race (Stalin is a
Georgian) will be the symbolic
chief.”
While thus expecting that a
group rather than an individual
will execute Politburo decisions
at first, and perhaps for some
time, “the best guess as to who
the eventual strong man would
be is Zhdanov.”

secret documents on the Nazi-Soviet

Union in the direction of the Indian
Ocean.” In N. Y. “Sun” George E.
Sokolsky comments: “Great Britain’s
most significant historical contribution
to India has been her ability to keep
Russia out. Great Britain no longer
stands at the gate. And ,no one
stands at the gate. No one at all.”

Moscow Fifth-Column School.
Until recently N. Y. “Times” Mos-
cow correspondent, Drew Middleton
states in a recent article in his paper
that in Moscow today there are vari-
ous schools “in which American,
British, French, Italian, Spanish and
South American groups are being
trained against the day when they
can return home to take up the work
of revolution, expressed in the form
of strikes, fomenting discontent, in-
ternal division and the shaking of
public confidence in established forms
of government and private institu-
tions.” The U.S., for one, has de-
cided that foreign-trained traitors are
a luxury no democracy can afford.

Arab Advantages. The warring
methods that have been tragically
effective against the British, who could
not retaliate in kind, are not work-
ing out so well against the Arabs in
Palestine, who, whatever they might
look like as soldiers, are specialists
in that particular line. London
“Times” has commented on them:
“The Arabs confine their activities
to the guerrilla warfare in which they
excel and they have all the advantages
of the country, as casualties inflicted
upon British as well as Jews prove.”

Making History. —Rather oddly, the
U.S. didn’t bother about an official
history of its part in the First World
War, but it’s making up for that.
Official historians were appointed to
scores of U.S. commands in the later
war, and, reports N. Y. “Times,” “In
Washington today 114 volumes of
official history of the United
war effort are being prepared.”

Uncle Sam’s Air Force. —U.S. Air
Force, at its war-time peak 2,411,000
men and 80,000 planes, is now offici-
ally put at 335,000 men and 24,000
planes, at which it is held to be still
the most powerful in the world. “It
has,” says N. Y. “Times,” “jet fight-
ers, rockets, guided missiles. It has
300 to 350 very heavy, long-range
bombers, including the six-engine
836, the world’s largest land-based
bomber.” Nevertheless, a commis-
sion appointed by Mr. Truman to
formulate a national air policy has
recommended: “More money should
be spent on the air forces than on
any other branch of the service; by
1952 total U.S. military expenses
should be nearly doubled.”

SMASH THE RED FRONT!
Communists in these parts, aping their
Muscovite masters in everything but the
employment of armed force—and that
may come —have taken to applying mili-
tary terms to their threats' and outrages.
Beaten in Victoria by a Government
which —unlike the blot on the name at
Canberra—saw its duty plain and
governed, the Communist leaders of
unions threatened that State with “sanc-
tions” should the Government ever en-
force the emergency law that was passed
and held in reserve when its mere appear-
ance in the Statute Book proved suffi-
cient for the immediate occasion. An-
ticipating the enactment of a similar mea-
sure in South Australia, these Com-
munists extended the threat of “sanc-
tions” to that State. In each case it
meant that they would blast all forms
of transport, internal and external, under
their control.
Presently one of the Victorian strike-
leaders bobbed up in Queensland, along
with the “budding commissars” and
“mimicking Molotovs” of Mr. Hanlon’s
indictment. Feasting his eyes on idle
trains and trucks —a pleasure denied him
in his own State, thanks to Mr. Holl-
way and Mr, McDonald—the ruffian told
the members of his union, many of them
restive because they had been refused a
ballot, that “all forces’ must be used to
win the fight—men must be marshalled
platoon by platoon if necessary.”
These unionists and their landlubber
mates having refused to be “marshalled
platoon by platoon,” the Seamen’s
Union, as announced by the secretary,
Casey, “imposed a complete blockade on
the movement of ships in Queensland,
inter-State and overseas.” The sinister ex-
pression “blockade” was repeated in the
Communist “Tribune,” exulting, as
always, in misery and anarchy, and re-
peated again when the Waterside
Workers’ Federation subjected all
Queensland ports to the ban which, the
pitiful crawlers of Canberra acquiescing
•—they rewarded it with appearance-
money and a multitude of other favors
for the asking—this Communist-con-
trolled organisation and the Communist-
controlled Seamen’s Union have main-
tained against Dutch East Indies shipping,
to the vast injury of this country, since
September, 1945. And the N. S. Wales
A.R.U., which has likeminded leaders,
and only a suit of clothes and a name to
reckon with (McGirr is the name) “closed
the last gap in the blockade of Queens-
land.”
“Sanctions” is an act of war. Block-
ade is war. And though the blockade of
Queensland has never been wholly effec-
tive—aircrews carrying freight and pas-
sengers and owners and drivers of trucks
and wagons, the latter returning good
for evil, have seen to that —it has caused,
and continues to cause, immense loss and
grievous suffering—grievous, that is, to
all but Communists and the stony-
hearted among their followers and dupes.
And the greatest sufferers have been
those with the greatest claim on and
challenge to those whose duty it is to
keep them supplied; women and child-
ren in remote settlements above or below
Capricornia. Some of these will die, if
they haven’t died already, and others
may never recover.
Even in the temperate south, and in
mild seasons, a widespread transport
strike, prolonged for weeks, is a sentence
of death to sick children, overwrought
women and old people who cannot fend
for themselves or totter along to the hos-
pital. With the Oriental cruelty of the
breed, the Communists chose summer for
their blockade of Queensland. And
places like Bowen (“out of baby-food
and powdered milk”), Cloncurry (“no
vegetables or fruit for a month”) and
many more in as harrowing a case or
worse, being floodbound as well as strike-
bound, are in the tropics, and others are
in the torrid west.
Other effects of the blockade were
listed by the Brisbane “Courier-Mail”—
of necessity incompletely—when the rail-
way stoppage had lasted a month;
A hundred thousand tons of sugar for
the south and overseas stranded in North
Queensland. Two hundred thousand boxes
of butter and 6000 tons of meat for Britain
held in depots and the like and slaughter
of cattle for export, normally yielding 1000
tons a week, reduced 60 per cent.
Wool worth £3,000,000 stacked in Bris-
bane stores, and payments for bales selling
at the rate of 55,000 a week suspended till
there are ships.
Foodstuffs, building materials, steel pro-
ducts, hardware, groceries, soap, matches,
afl essential for domestic and industrial life
fas trade with Queensland is essential for
domestic and industrial life in southern
States, particularly uninterrupted supplies of
sugar and timber] subjected to a holdup
which at the week-end was complete.
To this the Brisbane chairman of the
Overseas Shipping Representatives added
a justly bitter comment on the conse-
quences to Britain and other customers :
“Meat, wool, butter, raw materials idle in
wharf-sheds and nothing done. How
powerful the Communist element has be-
come ! ” And how insolent and traitorous
in its determination to do everything it
can by foul means to keep the British
people on their meagre and monotonous
rations so that discontent may be bred
and disorder perhaps promoted, and to
sabotage the nation’s recovery so that the
Marshall plan may fail. For that, of
course, is part of the Moscow-manufac-
tured plot.
The comment of the Brisbane spokes-
man for the Overseas Shipping Repre-
sentatives was followed by a statement in
which the Sydney chairman of the asso-
ciation gave the substance of an address
to the Stevedoring Industry Commission
—a Chifley-Evatt improvisation, “Com-
munist element” and all —by Healy,
general secretary of the Waterside
Workers’ Federation:
Mr. Healy said that, notwithstanding any
order from the Stevedoring Industry Com-
mission or any law, and despite the fact
that the Queensland Government has
sovereign rights, the Federation still intends
to defy the Queensland Government and
see that no cargo is moved in or out of
Queensland.
This insolence of Communist ruffian-
ism, as the Federal Opposition pointed
out, has rendered Healy, a Manchester
Irishman, liable to prosecution' and, on
conviction, to imprisonment and depor-
tation under the Crimes Act, the author
of which is the present Chief Justice of
the High Court, and which “Labor” has
not dared to repeal. The only pre-
requisite is a proclamation—amply
warranted in all conscience—of the exist-
ence of an industrial disturbance
threatening trade and commerce. The
Opposition did not expect the Prime
Minister to say that he would have the
proclamation issued and Healy prose-
cuted. It expected what it and the
country got from the exponent of bogus
pacifism—feeble evasion.
A related question Mr. Chifley could
not evade. He was asked whether he
would outlaw the Communist conspiracy,
as it was outlawed when Communists
were seditiously campaigning for a Hitler
peace. Choosing to forget Dr. Evatt’s
pledge when the outlawry order was
cancelled (“If the undertakings given”
by Communists “are not observed the
Government will reimpose the ban”), he
said he wouldn’t think of it, trotting out
the old stuff about Communists having
the right to propagate their “political
philosophy”—Christlike to Mr. Hollo-
way:—
The Government „ has already made it
clear that it does not propose to place
bans on any class of political philosophy.
In the situation that exists in Queens-
land this is flat betrayal, since it refuses
the nation that protection against in-
ternal foes which is one of the prescrip-
tive functions of Government, prescribed
in the Commonwealth Constitution itself;
and in the situation that has arisen in
Europe it is dangerous and detestable
cant and humbug.
That situation, as Mr. Chifley must
know, is comparable in every way to the
situation that arose when Hitler, in viola-
tion of his undertakings to Mr. Chamber-
lain, took possession of Czechoslovakia.
The only essential difference —other than
the fact that Hitler’s crime was less
abominable than Stalin’s', if only because
Austria and Czechoslovakia were for
many centuries parts of a German
■empire, whereas Hungary, Rumania,
Moravia, Bohemia and Slovakia were
never parts of a Russian empire—is that
Britain, as a result of Stalin’s turpitude,
has given a guarantee against further
aggression, this time to Austria, and this
time backed by the United States, as ex-
press and significant as the guarantee
given to Poland in 1939, out of which
came war. There were Nazis from Ger-
many here in 1939, and there were—and
are —more Germans and sons and grand-
sons of Germans in Australia than there
are Communists.
The great majority of our Germans
proved loyal to Australia in both World
Wars, and many died for Australia. But
suppose the Nazis corrupted them. Sup-
pose Hitler’s agents, perhaps in collusion
with Stalin’s agents—their masters' were
already “negotiating” in April, 1939
got control of trade-unions and Trades
and Labor Councils and the like. Sup-
pose they went in for sabotage and
brought about destructive strikes, strikes
reducing industrial law to a farce and
bringing all law into contempt among the
criminal classes. Suppose they did even
a tithe of the mischief that Communists
h£ve encompassed this last month, and
suppose a “Labor” Government had been
in office between March and September,
1939. Would even a “Labor” Govern-
ment have let them go their wicked way
on the ground that “ ‘Labor’ principles”
forbade it to interfere with “any class
of political philosophy.” No ; even a
Chifley “Government” would have hit
them with outlawry and deportation, if
only to save itself from being kicked
out and its party from being consigned
to everlasting infamy.
The “political-philosophy” sham, as
applied to Communists who did the
Nazis’ dirty work from September, 1939,
to June, 1941, proceeds from the sym-
pathy of association and a common
“objective” or from pusillanimity, or
from both.
"Cold War" Grows Hotter.
The Communist seizure of Czechoslo-
vakia under Moscow’s orders has no
doubt created, as the British Prime
Minister says, “widespread fear in
Europe” of an extension of the Soviet
dictatorship ; hut it has also made several
things quite plain. Among them:
A more general appreciation of what
Soviet policy consists of, and what it aims at,
in confirmation of warnings which British
and American leaders have long been de-
livering to their peoples.
The revelation that Russian Communism
has in reality no economic prosperity to
offer to the central European States, and
Moscow’s desperate efforts to cover up its
own failure.
An explanation of the whole course of
the Soviet’s attitude towards the United
Nations during the past two years.
A conviction in western Europe that only
the most energetic and united efforts can
enable it to resist the spread of the disease
of Communism in the favorable conditions
of chaos and hunger.
“Divide and ruin” is Moscow’s slogan.
Accordingly dissent and obstruction are
employed to disrupt every working body
of U.N.0.; treaties and agreements are
made only for deceit, for Russia keeps
none of them; Germany must be parti-
tioned, Europe partitioned, China and
Korea partitioned, peace settlements
everywhere stalled. And through Mos-
cow’s fifth-columns sabotage of industry
and trade is the policy, under Comin-
form orders, in every country seeking
to provide aid for the recovery of Britain
and Europe—or of China.
Facts behind the downfall of Czecho-
slovakia are that the Czech harvest last
summer was disastrous; that Stalin’s
current five-year plan is iri severe diffi-
culties ; that Moscow (having little grain
itself to spare) made an entirely spurious
trade-agreement with Prague which pro-
mised to supply immediately most of the
Czechs’ grain deficiency, and then sent
nothing; that the Czechs naturally with-
held exports in return, and the Soviet’s
home programme was absolutely depen-
dent upon the industrial potential of
Poland and Czechoslovakia. As soon as
hunger and the strangling of trade had
produced conditions sufficiently desperate
the Czechs were ripe for Communist
action. Henceforth Moscow settles the
trade-exchange problem simply by taking
over Czech industries.
One immediate effect of the Communist
coup in Prague was a hastening in both
the United States and western Europe
of preparations to get the Marshall plan
into action. Six weeks ago the New York
“Times” doubted whether the plan would
be operating by the scheduled date, April
1, and thought there might be another
three months’ delay. Every statesman
from the Elbe to the Potomac is now
emphatic that delay in face of Soviet
moves in Czechoslovakia and Finland
would bring on further blows against
Austria and Italy (where also elections
are preparing) and create despair
throughout the West.
A secondary development is that the
Marshall plan itself is taking on for all
parties a new meaning. The British
Government has gone over completely to
the view that, in Mr. Bevin’s words be-
fore the House of Commons in late
January, “Western Europe, including
Britain, must now draw closer together.”
In advance of a meeting in Paris of “the
sixteen countries,” Britain, France and
the three Lowland States of the “Bene-
lux” union met in conference to negoti-
ate that very fusion. They are also the
nations chiefly interested in the admini-
stration of the Ruhr. Three more, the
Scandinavian countries, are due next week
to make up their minds —in face of
“latest events in Finland and Czecho-
slovakia” —about their adherence to the
Western Union. Of the remainder,
“Bizonia” Germany, Italy and Austria
cannot stay out, Switzerland is shaping
to join, Greece and Turkey are abso-
lutely dependent upon U.S. military
support. Iceland and Ireland complete
the 16.
The trend thus indicated has probably
been assisted by the trade discussions at
Geneva and Havana which contemplated
the formation of regions of closer trade.
But unquestionably the need to present
a common front against the Comin-
form is the prime motive. U.N.O. can
hardly develop as an organ of world gov-
ernment during the next four years while
the chief democratic Powers bend all their
efforts to the strengthening of the Western
Union under the European Recovery
Programme, and an eastern bloc under
Russia uses all its political weapons to
combat those very efforts. The prospects
would seem to be that either the Russian
bloc will fail, possibly under open in-
surrection among the suppressed nations,
or that, if it does not, then U.N.O. itself
will be permanently partitioned.
In this connection a forecast two
months ago by a writer in The World
Today (Chatham House) falls very aptly.
In the course of a review of the breach
between the Soviet and the democracies
he submitted that the establishment of
the Cominform should be taken “as
the first step in the creation of a new in-
ternational organisation to which the
Soviet Union and its supporters will re-
treat” when they leave U.N.0.; and he
quoted Gromyko: any member had “the
right to leave U.N.O. as an expression of
State sovereignty,”
This, then, is “the cold war” —fast
growing hot —the combating of Russian
aggression and the sabotage by Commu-
nists outside Russia of the democracies’
political and industrial efforts towards
recovery. While the Marshall pro-
gramme, if it succeeds, is expected to
defeat the Communist schemes, the
chances of another war are not to be
ignored for these reasons:
U.N.O. may be split in two.
Revolt among the Soviet’s satellite States
—and there has apparently been a rising in
the Ukraine—may precipitate a conflict in
central Europe.
The pressing-through of the Marshall
plan, which must run to a schedule if
America is to remain satisfied, will almost
certainly demand the suppression in west-
ern Europe of Communist activities.
Speaking for the Attlee Government in
the House of Lords, Lord Pakenham has
given a guarantee of “unshakable support”
for the integrity of Austria.
And, lastly, the Cominform has set up
at Harbin to maintain chaos in the Far
East just as maliciously as in Europe.
The date for the much-planned Allied
settlement with Japan seems to be as far
off as the Greek Calends. Russia is not
alone in insisting that the Great Powers
shall draw up the terms for Japan, for
China, under grievances of her own and
Soviet threats, is taking the same stand.
Moscow’s “aggressive and expansionist"
policy is being developed against both
China and the United States —the one in
Manchuria and North China (now almost
lost to the Chinese Government), by aid
of the Communist rebels ; the other in
Korea, where the Russian Administra-
tion in the north is defying every com-
promise as persistently as in Europe.
U.N.O. Assembly’s decision that elections
shall be held in Korea “as soon as pos-
sible,” and the local American com-
mander’s ordering them for May 9, are
matched on the other side by Moscow’s
proclamation of North Korea as a puppet
Soviet republic. Both here and in Man-
churia it is being freely said that the Com-
munist forces have been armed with Jap-
anese weapons, and even stiffened with
Japanese Kwantung Army personnel
from Russian prisoner-of-war camps.
A gibe becoming familiar on the ears
is that the Western Allies will have to
wind up the war by restoring their late
enemies, Germany and Japan, to keep
Russia in check. The risk in the restora-
ation of industrial economy in both those
defeated countries is one which, it has
been agreed, must be taken. German
coal and heavy industry are essential for
European recovery, and, apart from
Asia’s consumer demand, the Japanese
people must in their confined space of
the future manufacture export goods in
order to live. Beyond these urgent short-
range plans no man can see clearly.
But in East Asia an old and historic
truth is rising again to confront the
western democracies, whose statesmen
made a: mess of their war-time disposi-
tions for China and Manchuria. That
truth is that China never did —within the
period of Europe’s acquaintance with her,
at any rate —rule Manchuria ; if anything,
Manchuria governed China in the sense
that the ruler of Manchuria held the
traditional gate of invasion from the
north. The Great Wall is proof enough
of that condition. If the Soviet through
its puppets is to hold Manchuria, and
thereby command North China, then the
Japan of the future, like the Japan of the
past, must either challenge the Soviet for
that commanding ground or make some
compact that satisfies her.
Right up to the Cairo conference in
1942 President Roosevelt insisted that
Manchuria should at the peace settle-
ment be “restored to China” —Chiha,
which could never hold it against either
Russia or Japan, or even keep authority
over one of its own satraps there. Even
worse was the invitation to Russia to
invade Manchuria at the very hour when
Japan was struck down from the sea.
Washington is' awake to the unpleasant
truth of the situation today.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Riches on Poverty Flat.
Apropos of the pensions steal which is
to be added to last year’s salary grab if
Federal “Labor” continues to believe that
Australia has no longer a national con-
science and will stand anything, Mr,
Menzies, to whom some approaches must
have been made, said this in a speech at
Parramatta;
I am told that Caucus is on the point of
announcing to an astonished world that
there is a pension scheme for us —five
hundred pounds a year for life after six
years’ service.
The first inspired account, communi-
cated by way of trying it on the dog,
was that there were to be £9 a week for
life for the M.H.R. retired or defeated
after nine years and £6 a week for the
two-term M.H.R. and the one-term
Senator. Where, as in “Labor” Australia,
there is no sign of public spirit, impu-
dence and greed have no limits. The
Opposition-leader proceeded:
Isn’t it amazing? One term of six years
and then five hundred a year for life. And
you should see some of the people we
get in the Senate!
It is enough to hear them when A.B.C.
turns on their “deliberations.” One such
experience is enough for the vast
majority of listeners. And the gentlemen
have so little to do that, although the
House has been sitting since February
18, they are not to be called together for
“deliberations” till after Easter. Mean-
time and at other times they have no
constituents to ply them with grievances.
Seeing constituents is no part of their
“duties.”
Eighteen of these Senators, 15 “Labor,”
were elected in September, 1946. The
salary was then £lOOO, and they must
have been willing to take the six-year
job at that figure, plus privileges, or they
wouldn’t have been in the field. Neither
they nor any of their associates uttered
a word of dissatisfaction with the terms
of the contract in which they were about
to enter with the people. But before
they took their seats in July, 1947, the
salary grab had been consummated and
they began drawing £l5OO a year for six
years without any known refusal of an
additional penny on conscientious
grounds. Now we have the monstrous
proposition that at the end of the six
years there should be added to the ill-
gotten £3OOO, less tax (if tax hasn’t been
abolished in the interim), a life pension
of £lO a week, payable immediately on
defeat or retirement —which means that
one-term Senators will be better off than
any two desperately-wounded servicemen
or arty three war widows. And the 18
other Senators due for defeat or retire-
ment on June 30, 1950, will have “quali-
fied” then.
And, if an unthought-of constitutional
difficulty can be overcome, there are to
be 24 more Senators and 47 more
Ms.H.R., mostly city chaps, to share in
the never-ending shower of easy money
unless the old Australian spirit asserts
itself and scares the easy-money boys into
dropping the project and the plunder.
Chameleon Lawgiving.
Webster defines the chameleon:
An acrodont lizard having a laterally
compressed body, prehensile tail, and
opposed digits. Can shoot out its tongue
for a distance nearly equal to its length to
catch insects. Eyeballs very large and are
moved independently of each other, but the
lids are fused together leaving only a
small central opening. Remarkable for
changes of color of the skin, which are
governed by nerve stimuli dependent on the
mood of the animal, as well as on sur-
rounding conditions. The chameleons con-
stitute a family.
In one of the world’s most ancient land-
masses this creature assumed to in-
terpret the law in the highest Court with
some remarkable assurance. It appeared
a quarter of a century ago to argue be-
fore the tribunal that the constitutional
power of the land as regards deportation
of revolutionarily-disposed imnjigrants,
on the advice of a Federal Board, was
bad, inasmuch as' it attempted to permit
delegation of the powers of the Governor-
General who, “being himself a delegate,
cannot delegate.” A great jurist, at
other times much respected by this ad-
vocate, commented sharply from the
Bench “Do you think we have come
down from the planet Mars?” And the
Chief Justice added “Youil argument
would make an end of Section 51, and
the whole legislative power of the Com-
monwealth would be gone.”
But “the eyelids are fused together,
leaving only a small central opening,”
and the tongue, not the ears, of this zoo-
logical specimen is its striking feature.
Ten years later, itself sitting on that
lofty judgment-bench, it declared that the
Commonwealth was “not a completely
sovereign body,” and condemned the
Commonwealth’s assertion of right,
againgt an aggrieved State, to act as
“plaintiff, Judge and executioner,” and its
claim to “an unequal and dis-
criminating jurisdiction.” This also was
rejected by the majority of the Court.
But because “the mood of the animal
and the surrounding conditions” govern
its behavior, nobody need be surprised
to behold it now pleading—still before
the same august tribunal —that Common-
wealth powers! are plenary, even to pro-
hibition of commercial activities by any
but “selected” fellow-inhabitants of the
land: that it can abolish them, turn
them out, acquire their property and
transfer their interests and activities to
anybody whom the chameleon and its
fellow-partisans may select; and do all
this for the advancement of peace, order
and good government, of a free democ-
racy, the source of inspiration of human
rights—as understood, of course, by
chameleorts.
The Little Molotovs.
The Communists in this country are
speedily splitting “Labor” even at the cost
of killing the Chifley Government, their
best friend. The inter-State dispute of
which Chifley sits in dread is inexorably
looming up.
Why this fear at Canberra? The an-
swer is that in Chifley’s political follow-
ing the restiveness created by the Bank
Grab Act has been renewed by Queens-
land and Victorian members’ alarm at the
havoc wrought in their home unions by
the Communists. Not a Queensland
“Labor” member has dared open his
mouth at Canberra on the month-long
blockade of his State by what Hanlon
calls “interlopers” and “mimicking Molo-
tovs” from the south. They, too, want
to see Chifley support Hanlon.
Nor is the “Labor” split confined to
Queensland. In Victoria, since the Shop
Assistants’ Union revolted against the
A.L.P. on the suspension by the Thorn-
bury branch of its president, Andley, for
having opposed an A.L.P. industrial-group
candidate for union office, an old union
feud, dating back to 1935 —the year in
which the late John Curtin was given the
job of reuniting the “Labor” party—has
flared up again. Another official expelled
by the Thornbury A.L.P. was T. Barry,
of the Communist-run clerks’ union. The
Communists have been egging on the
rebels, and Scott, of the local engine-
drivers, joined cause by withholding
A.L.P. affiliation-dues in token of defiance
towards the industrial-group movement
to which Chifley had given his blessing.
In January the rebels (said to represent
23 unions) discussed a new political
organisation divorced from the A.L.P.
This was answered by the Victorian
“Labor” executive’s decision that it would
declare what candidates for union office
were fit to receive support from the in-
dustrial movement, and that it would
take disciplinary action against any
affiliated union opposing the A.L.P.’s new
groups. The four C’s in the Victorian
A.L.P. —Calwell, Cameron, Clarey and
Cain—attended the executive meet-
ing last month which resolved to “protect
itself against minority domination and
infiltration tactics by Communists” and
specifically called on all unions “to recog-
nise the right of the A.L.P. to inform
unionists who are followers of the A.L.P.
policy and who are not.”
This row still smoulders, and the Com-
munist-run Victorian A.R.U. has de-
manded a purging of the Melbourne
Trades and Labor Council for its “failure
to plan any real campaign against the
Essential Services Bill” at the time of
the Victorian strike.
These are some of the reasons why
Chifley has sat inactive while the
richest State of the Commonwealth is
being laid waste by a strike which (as
Hanlon says) has “all the elements of
civil war.”
Dockyard Strikes.
Delay in construction of a destroyer at
Cockatoo Dock through a strike for 10s.
“disability” money is illustrative of the
enormous cost in time and money these
Communist-engineered stoppages have
caused at Cockatoo and Garden Island.
The Empire’s largest naval dockyard
south of the Line, Garden Island can be
more effectively immobilised by Commu-
nists than by a fleet of enemy bombers.
Work done is wholly naval, and with
secrets of radar-sets, gunnery-control and
anti-submarine instruments bared to Com-
munists, it is time naval authorities re-
placed them with ex-servicemen, prefer-
ably naval.
Naval - gunners, wireless - operators,
engine-room artificers and so on would
work on gear they had been used to ser-
vicing under all conditions for years.
They would be kept up-to-date with all
the latest modifications to which the com-
plex innards of a warship are continually
subject, and in time of war would form
a solid, loyal core of highly-trained main-
tenance men.
Working still under the Naval Discip-
line Act, such ridiculous situations as
strikes over sailors obligingly disconnect-
ing electric leads of guns to be lifted, or
painting their own mess-decks, would be
obviated. Men who had fought their
ships through six years of war would be
ashamed to claim “danger”-money for
venturing outside the Heads on ship trials.
It is inconceivable that a warship’s
captain would steam his ship with known
Communists in his crew. By the same
token, units of that fleet “upon which the
wealth, strength and safety of the country
do chiefly depend” should be spared their
loathly attentions in port.
SERGEANT CHIFLEY ON THE JOB.
“Sure, and I’m making the closest observance of Constable Hanlon’s behavior in this regrettable dispute.”

POLITICAL POINTS
Suggested question “without notice”:
Arising out of replies given this session
and last, (1) Has the Prime Minister read
any newspaper report on anything during
his term of office? (2) Does he read any-
thing ? (3) Can he?
Thompson (Hindmarsh), put up to de-
fend his crow'd’s neutrality in the Com-
munist war on Queensland —or to send
listeners to sleep, as he generally does—
blithered that past acts of anti-“ Labor”
Governments had forced the workers into
the arms of the Communists. Queens-
land has had “Labor” Administrations,
with one brief interlude, since June,
1915, the Commonwealth since October,
1941 —and there was only one non-
“ Labor” Cabinet (S.A.’s) most of the
time. Yet since October, 1941, as every-
one but Thompson knows, the Com-
munist grip on trade-unionism has
tightened.
Except as to salary and pension grabs
and manufacture of safe seats for “Labor,”
Canberra has two eternal formulas:
(1) “A decision has been deferred” ; (2)
“It’s a matter f0r”.... a State Govem-
jnent, a State industrial tribunal, a board,
a commissioner, a controller, a co-ordi-
nator, anyone or anything. Reporting on
the desperate position in January-
February, 1942, Wavell, then Supreme
Commander A.8.D.A., says it took him a
fortnight to get a decision from Can-
berra, the decision being that he would
be responsible for the defence of Darwin
and such of North Westralia as was con-
nected with that defence. The wonder is
that he got a decision at all.
Cable services thought it worthy of re-
port that a typist—Australian by all ac-
counts —had to prepare the first meal
stowed away by the first U.N. Commis-
sion party on reaching Jerusalem, no
Arab or Jew “babbler” being available.
One of the party is a Mr. Gosh. The
Glugs are expected to arrive any time —
probably feet-first.
It has come out that Commonwealth
departments use about 600,000 gallons of
petrol a month in 10,811 motor vehicles
—say, 55 gallons a month per vehicle.
On a basis of 20 m.p.g. that’s 1100 miles
a month. And people wonder why petrol
is short!
Chifley to Conelan: Lib. and Kewpie
organisers in Queensland get extra petrol
rations “for business purposes.” And so,
no doubt, do Communist organisers,
which explains why Communist leaders
qan speed from place to place to take
control of strikes against law, people and
country.
Dedman’s “tariff adjustments” have
been roughly handled by Menzies, Mc-
Ewen and Archie Cameron. ‘ Archie
handsomely allowed that Deddy had
secured a reduction of duty on imports of
Australian bacon and pork into Moslem
Pakistan.
The Stevedoring Industry Commission
has corrected a misleading impression that
it forced gangs of wharfies to load 41b.
of sugar in one lift when 31b. was enough
for any gang. It admits that it requested
the sturdy unionists to use 16-bag
slings when toying with 12-bag slings had
caused the unloading rate to fall horribly.
The wharfies' struck. Three days later
Sydney pubs were out of beer, and the
sugar gangs went back to 16-bag slings.
Governments looking for ways of stop-
ping strikes might try shutting all pubs
for the duration in strike areas.
Dr. Evatt, arguing before the High
Court that the powers of the Common-
wealth are plenary, regardless of States
and individuals —even to the extent of
abolishing or expropriating commercial
enterprises and relicensing them to
some “selected” monopolist—stirred up
memories, if not ghosts. Appearing for
the Sinn Feiner O’Flanagan and O’Kelly
in 1923, he put it to the Bench that a vital
section of the Immigration Act was in-
valid. “Do you think we have come
down from the planet Mars?” asked Isaac
Isaacs. “Your argument would make an
end of the Commonwealth’s legislative
powers altogether,” said Adrian Knox,
C.J. Argument rejected. Deportation
upheld.
According to A-B.C. the Goldberg
appeal is to come on for hearing before
Easter. Let Minister Holloway (Novem-
ber 6) enter again:
Mr. Goldberg was convicted and fined
£250 on April 11. Later his counsel de-
cided to appeal. All the delay caused from
April 11 to October 14 was due to the
wishes of Mr. Goldberg’s counsel. Since
then the delay has been caused by the
absence in London of Mr. Shand, K.C.
That went down with Holloway’s mob,
and the Opposition offered no objection ;
but their Honors are apt to take a dim
view of such “causes” for delay. In a
Sydney equity case (February 24) Justice
Roper came down hard on an application
for postponement, made on the ground
that a K.C. had taken a Melbourne brief,
saying “This Court cannot stop work
because counsel is engaged in another
State; there are sufficient members of
the Bar to cope with the work available.”
Original contribution to the Tasmanian
no-confidence debate by Jackson (Opposi-
tion) : —-
People are likening us to a bunch of
bananas because we come in green, turn
yellow and are never straight.
There were hoarse cries of “I’m not yel-
low, I am straight” and “Withdraw!
Withdraw!” Unlike the Jackson of Bull
Run, Jackson withdrew.
A sorry effect of the housing shortage
shows up in the maternity payments for
seven months : 115,679 in July-February,
1946-47 ; 104,312 in the corresponding
period of 1947-48. “Labor” is all there
with excuses. None was necessary after
the first World War when, with the popu-
lation around 5,000,000, 136,406 babies
were born in 1920, 136,198 in 1921 and
137,496 in 1922 (17,681 more, than in
1938), number of births per 1000 of meah
annual population being 25.45, 24.95 and
24.69 respectively. But only one “ ‘Labor’
Government” was in office then —in
Queensland. And even there “Labor”
had its part in a housing movement
which has not been approached in
1945-48, though “Labor” planning and
bragging have been incessant.
The fall in the birthrate wasn’t fea-
tured in Sydney newspaper posters. A
beer drought was. Newspapers and com-
munities so disturbed about beer can’t
be expected to do any worrying about
unborn babies.
Over in Maoriland Peter Fraser and
party are standing up to Communists as
firmly as Queensland’s Hanlons and Vic-
toria’s Hollways. With the undisguised
support of many railwaymen, the Holl-
ways said they wouldn’t tolerate the Com-
munist boss Brown and his pals dragging
Victoria into the “blockade” of Queens-
land. To this they added such meaning
references to enforcement of the emer-
gency legislation that ended the tram and
bus strike and prevented a railway strike
that Brown already snubbed by
branches of his union on other
scurried for cover, his tail larding the lean
earth.
Ignoring threats, Peter Fraser has
struck at the bosses of the N.Z. Car-
penters’ Union for “inciting or encourag-
ing” go-slow and had them substantially
fined. Unionists, he commented, “are in
no privileged position in respect of the
observance of the law, and they should
realise that they are being used as pawns
in a bigger game on a bigger field: Com-
munist tactics in all countries are to stir
up internal strife.”
The Communist Sharkey, now in
Asiatic parts telling all and sundry that
his mob would wipe out White Australia,
can scarcely find it hard to convince those
who can read that it could do the job.
It has boycotted Queensland as well as
N.E.I. shipping, stopped Queensland
trains and closed wharves and coalmines.
All this though there is one (1) Commu-
nist member in all the seven Parliaments;
and he got in on a minority vote. And all
because Chifley’s “Government” hasn’t
the pluck of a louse.
Chifley’s mortal fear of Communists is
shared by the miserable McGirr. That
poor fish of a Premier, already associated
with Communists in trying to force rail-
waymen, even unionists, to join the
A.R.U., which Communists have in their
bags—with the shivering McGirr ac-
quiescing, the A.R.U. has “closed the last
gap” in the Communist “blockade” of
Queensland —let a Communist-led mob
take possession of a busy block of Pitt-
street, Sydney, for two hours of the
busiest day of the week. About the same
time another Communist-led mob
marched to Parliament House, Brisbane,
bent on frightening Caucus into seeing
their leaders. Caucus refused to see the
fellows and, with the mob still at the
gates and presumably ripe for an uglier
“demonstration” if called upon, passed a
unanimous vote of confidence in Hanlon.
That is courage.
“The Government has lifted the general
prohibition imposed in June, 1940, on the
Communist party and its press.” Thus
Dr. Evatt on December 18, 1942, and he
went on to say that he had been moved
by “satisfactory undertakings, entered
into by certain individuals representing
themselves and the Communist party,”
which bound all concerned, among other
things,
To do their utmost to promote harmony
in industry, to minimise absenteeism, stop-
pages, strikes or other holdups.
There followed another “undertaking”
binding .on the other party to the con-
tract :
If the undertakings given are not observed
the Government will reimpose the ban.
That has been repudiated, as the “certain
individuals” and their mob have repudi-
ated their “undertakings” a thousand
times, in the latest instance besieging
Queensland and engaging in open insur-
rection against all industrial law, Com-
monwealth and State. Chifley won’t
“crucify” the Communists, and Dr.
Evatt has found the perfect funkhole
in the High Court.
Part of a resolution adopted at a
Farmers’ Union conference in Westralia:
A sinister anti-British and un-Australian
influence is tending to dictate Federal
Government policy.
Another part read “Production has been
and is being sabotaged by exorbitant tax
demands.” With “restricted” substituted
for “sabotaged” the thing was carried.
Hiley, the new leader of the Queens-
land People’s party, alias the Kewpies,
made a miserable, start by attacking Han-
lon when Hanlon was standing firm
against wreckers and baby-starvers:
W's consider the State Government blun-
dered badly by adopting an adamant strike-
breaking attitude.
A day or so later, perhaps because of an
internal revolt, it was butter instead of
guns;
Now that maintenance of constitutional
Government is the main issue the People’s
party will give its wholehearted support to
the State Government.
“Maintenance of constitutional Govern-
ment” has been “the main issue” all
along.
Willis (Queensland) and Hartigan
(N.S.W.) were contemporary Railway
Commissioners for seven years, and they
will soon be in retirement together,
though with contrasting memories. Willis
went out on a Saturday with a pointed
reminder to the striking railwaymen of
their duty to the public and 2 pithy ulti-
matum : “Be at work on Monday or con-
sider yourselves sacked.” Hartigan had
previously issued an ultimatum to his
railwaymen: “Join an approved union
or out you go!” Ignoble, for Hartigan’s
railways are not under political control,
though they soon will be. A member of
a union not “approved” sought an in-
junction against Hartigan in the Equity
Court. Justice Sugerman refused it, but
told the spirited fellow that if he were
dismissed he could “take proceedings;
adequate remedy is provided by law for
anyone dismissed for disobeying the
order.” And that goes for all the other
members of the “Labor”-Communist-
Hartigan-banned union ; and there are
over a thousand of them,
On one point Justice Sugerman’s de-
cision in the case of the railwayman
threatened with the sack is open to ques-
tion. Said his Honor: “Ahearn claimed
first that the A.R.U.,” which he refused
to join, “was controlled by Communists
or Cpmmunist sympathisers, and cross-
examination showed that he knew of no
basis of fact for the claim.” Heaps of
others could supply the “basis of fact.”
That very day “the N.S.W. executive of
the A.R.U.,” headed by a poor creature
named Ferguson—branded as a Com-
munist before the A.L.P. put him at the
head of its organisation and made him an
M.L.C.—“decided to ban all goods con-
signed to or from Queensland” in support
of the Communist siege of that State,
From “1906 and All That”:
it transpires that there cannot under the
present Constitution be that enlargement of
Parliament on which Caucus has set its heart
For between the date of the 1949 elections
and the following Ju i y t he number of sitting
Senators, remaining at 36, would not
fulfil the constitutional requirement that
the number of members of the House (to be-
come 122) shall be, as nearly as practicable,
twice the number of Senators.”
if the Attorney-General cannot bring him-
self to differ from that view, then the Govern-
ment must (0 arrange by a sham-fight to dis-
solve the whole Senate in 1949, or (2) hold a
referendum before June to amend the provision
naming [he month in which new Senators begin
f unc tion. A choice between two evils.

Chileans and Guatemalans. Last week a

PERSONAL ITEMS
Visiting Australia as treasurer of the
British Sailors’ Society—-among other
amenities for seamen it runs libraries on
4000 ships and in 56 ports —Sir Frederick
Sykes is the man who founded the Royal
Flying Corps. He commanded it in
France during the early part of the
Kaiser’s war, and was in charge of the
Royal Naval Air Service in the Eastern
Mediterranean in 1915-16. Sykes was a
trooper in the Imperial Yeomanry in
the Boer War, was commissioned with
the 15th Hussars in 1901 and served in
India. He took on ballooning in 1904
and flying six years later. His service
has been more varied than that of most
men. In addition to his air service he
was a temporary colonel of the Royal
Marines and A.A. and Q.M.G. of the
Fourth Mounted Division in 1916;
Brigadier-General and Deputy-Director,
War Office, 1917 ; sat on the Supreme
War Council at Versailles; was Chief of
the Air Staff and Chief of the British Air
Section at the Peace Conference. After
the first war he was Controller-General
of Civil Aviation for three years, M.P.
for Sheffield for six and Governor of
Bombay for five. Then he went back to
the Commons again, but was unseated at
the 1945 swing. Sykes has a long string
of British decorations, and almost as
many from foreign countries. He’s a past
chairman of the Royal Empire Society.
Unique among “Labor” leaders, State
and Federal, in having courage enough
to defend democratic Government against
mob rule, Queensland Premier Hanlon
has another attribute that distinguishes
him from other “Labor” Premiers—or
perhaps it is the same one. He is the
only one of the bunch who can feel really
at home at a Diggers’ function, knowing
that he is there in his own right and not
merely by virtue of his office. At a Bris-
bane dinner to Eric Millhouse, Federal
president of R.S.L., the other night he
was accorded a warm reception. Hanlon
served four years with the 9th Battalion
in World War I.
Named as first head of the National
University at Canberra, Professor
EJouglas Berry Copland, C.M.G., M.A.,
D.Sc., and Litt. D. (Harvard) has held
many big jobs, but first came to the fore
during the 1930 depression. Born in
Timaru (M.L.) in 1894, and educated at
Canterbury College, he was Professor of
Economics at the University of Tasmania
from 1920 to 1924, and when Sydney
Myer established the chair of Commerce
at Melbourne University he crossed Bass
Strait to occupy it. During the; crisis of
the ’thirties he was one of the principal
advisers of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, and he was one of the authors of
the Premiers’ Plan. R. G. Menzies
appointed him economic adviser almost
before the gong sounded for the late war,
and he carried that position through the
regime of Curtin into that of Chifley,
adding as a sideline the position of Prices
Commissioner. Three years ago Cop-
land became Minister to China. He has
given memorial lectures: at Harvard and
Cambridge, has served on scores of com-
mittees and has written a raft of books
on the “mad science.” A very arresting
personality to boot.
Anyone with the notion that male opera
singers are a sissy bunch had better pay
a visit backstage at the Princess Theatre,
Melbourne. Among the characters who
share the dressing-room with John Till-
brook, tenor of the Australian Opera
Company, are an ex-timbergetter, a
boxer and several ex-soldiers, all round
about 6ft. in height and built in pro-
portion. Tillbrook himself trained as a
commando and was seconded to an Allied
Intelligence unit which made a habit of
dropping him, and others, behind the
enemy lines and, later, of sending them
ashore in the first wave of Allied landings.
His singing career began with troop en-
tertainments in the jungle, and he came
out of the army firmly convinced that his
war experiences had ruined his voice. Re-
hab. gave him two years at the Albert-
street Conservatorium, where he met
singer John Fullard and producer Lennox
Brewer. They encouraged him to further
study. Tillbrook was born in England,
but came to Australia at three. He com-
bines the appearance of a handsome
blacksmith and the chest of a champion
wrestler with an unassuming nature and a
voice of considerable sweetness.
G. B. Shaw has maintained that until a
man is 40 he is only in his formative
years ; his “middle period” is from there
to 60; thereafter he is in his “prime.”
By that reckoning Harold Grant Ferrier,
whose features are here recorded by
Dubois, has done a whale of a lot of
“forming.” At 42 he is joint managing-
director of the marine-engineering firm,
Ferrier, Dickinson and Weir-Drysdale,
MARINE ENGINEERING.
and is in the chair of the Pioneer Springs
Company, W. W. Martin and Sons and
the Kingston Foundry. Add to all this
his recent appointment as president of the
Metal Trades Employers’ Association.
Ferrier mastered his three Rs at Sydney
Grammar, served an apprenticeship in
his father’s firm and went on to complete
his technical and workshop studies in large
engineering workshops in Britain. He
was hauled out of the Army during the
war to supervise work for Munition and
Navy Departments and for the Shipbuild-
ing Board, and was flown to Britain in
1944 to see about extending Australian
manufacture of auxiliary machinery for
merchant and naval vessels and the ser-
vicing of special machinery installed in
Australia-based units of the British
Pacific Fleet. He’s a member of the In-
stitute of Marine Engineers. With the
years he has passed up Rugby Union and
rowing for hunting, shooting and fishing.
Commodore Henry Arthur Showers,
C.8.E., R.A.N., recently appointed
Second Naval Member to the Australian
Naval Board, was, in his time, the
R.A.N.’s outstanding sportsman. During
his short attachment to the R.N., toward
the end of the first world scrap, he won
the Grand Fleet middleweight boxing
championship and played Rugby Union
for Kent and Hampshire. Later chang-
ing to hockey, he represented the Medi-
terranean Fleet at the Barcelona Exhibi-
tion in 1929. But his service hasn’t been
all sport. He skippered H.M.A.S. Hobart
in the battles of the Solomon Islands and
later relieved his new boss, Rear-Admiral
J. A. Collins (then commodore), in com-
mand of Shropshire. With her Showers
took part in the combined operations of
occupation at Wakde, Biak, Sansapor and
Morotai. Soon after the Japs threw in
the towel he took the Victory Contingent
to England in Shropshire. He relieves
Commodore J, M. Armstrong, D. 5.0.,
R.A.N., who becomes Director of Ord-
nance, Torpedoes and Mines.
Melbourne architects Alec Hall and
E. Milston have been judged joint win-
ners of the prize for the best thesis on
adapting the Shrine of Rembrance as a
memorial for both world wars. The
entry of the third-prize winner, W.
Davies, will be incorporated in the
final design, the execution of which will
cost £60,000. Alec Hall served in the
first war and E. Milston in the second.
A naturalised Czech, Milston is a sculp-
tor and painter ; as one of Prague’s lead-
ing architects he designed the library for
the palace in which President Benes
signed over his country to Gottwald.
Davies is a Maorilander. The memorial,
a great monumental forecourt on the
city side of the Shrine, will rule out the
Pool of Reflection which some people
think is the Shrine’s most effective feature.
The Davies design envisages statues
symbolising a son and a father who
fought in the two wars.
Victoria’s police force today holds
many who served with distinction during
the war, among them 24-year-old Major
R. S. Aitken, M.A., a Scot from Bonny-
bridge, near Glasgow, who, as an officer
of the Royal Tank Corps, fought at Ala-
mein alongside the A.I.F. In the Africa
scrapping he was blown up twice, one
tank running over a mine, the other stop-
ping a German 88mm. shell, Aitken, who
has a voice like an echo across the moors,
now finds many of his former colleagues
from the Ninth Division wearing the uni-
form he, too, has changed into.
First Professor of Music to be
appointed to Sydney Uni., Donald Peart
arrived from Britain the other day on the
Stratheden. There is no degree course
in music in Sydney, and to begin with
the notes and quavers will shelter under
the wing of the Arts course; a degree will
come later. Professor Peart played in the
London Philharmonic Orchestra under
Sir Thomas Beecham. His favorite instru-
ments are the violin and viola, but he
was carrying a ukulele when he stepped
ashore.
J. Sparkes, Queensland M.L.A. for
Aubigny and owner of the Lyndley
Hereford Stud at Dalby, is said
to hold a world record for a studmaster;
in the 35 years since he began to breed
the Lyndley Herefords, not one buyer
who has visited the stud in person to
buy bulls has left without placing an
order. This year 90 p.c. of the bulls
sold were dispatched without the buyers
inspecting them. Sparkes, who is also a
well-known Hereford judge, will leave
by air in May to visit some leading Here-
ford studs in England and America, and
hopes to import a draft of homed and
polled Herefords.
Herewith Warwick Seymour Brace-
girdle, D.S.C. and bar, R.A.N., son of
Rear-Admiral Leighton Bracegirdle, who
was military secretary to so many Gs.-G.
“Braces” is shortly off to U.K. to do a
staff course at the Royal Naval College,
Greenwich, where he will in all proba-
bility be a classmate of the Duke of
NAVAL GUNNERY.
Edinburgh. While serving in H.M.A.S.
Perth in the Mediterranean he was
decorated with the D.S.C., and added a
bar to it later as gunnery-officer of
Shropshire in the Philippines campaign.
A breezy, cheery type, for whom the
troops will do anything.

Australia include only two aborigines—
Uniapon, the preacher, and Namatjira,
the artist, though another could be added
—Onus, the Melbourne actor and
organiser of his fellow-abos. His
sponsors hope that tenor Harold Blair,
recently given a benefit concert at
Melbourne Town Hall, will be another.
He is 14 stone, has the chest and lungs
necessary to a singer and a voice that
Marjorie Lawrence and Tod Duncan de-
clared to be a natural, only needing to
be developed to get into the world class.
A Queensland mission-station took
charge of Blair’s juvenile education, and a
South Aus. mission carried it further.
He might have remained a truck-driver
on the canefields making a hit at local
concerts if his admirers hadn’t taken him
to see Miss Lawrence when that distin-
guished vocalist was singing in Brisbane.
She heard his voice and promptly invited
local musical critics to listen to it. The
men in the Ipswich railway workshops
provided the finance. At present Blair is
doing a course at the Conservatorium in
Melbourne, but his supporters hope to
send him to U.S. for a final polish. On
the platform he has the same easy poise
as his colleague of the same skin color,
Tod Duncan.
“Uramao”: Gerald Nairn, who, with
his brother Norman, established a motor
service across the Arabian Desert after the
First World War, in which they fought
with the N.Z.E.F., is holidaying in Auck-
land, where he has a son at the University
College. In 1923 the Nairn brothers saw
possibilities in a motor-transport service
to replace the camel-trains that took 11
days to cross the desert. Despite political
factions, desert brigands and the vested
interests of the camel proprietors, the
Maorilanders succeeded in reducing the
journey to 24 hours early in the history
of the enterprise. Now the 550-mile
Damascus-Bagdad journey takes 16 hours
in stainless-steel 18-passenger Pullman
coaches. World War II Diggers will recall
trips by the desert service. Normally the
route is between Beirut, Damascus and
Bagdad, but during the Vichy regime, tfie
Iraq rebellion and other dust-ups many
interruptions to the service occurred.
John Burne Mills at 32 is young to
hold the job of chief engineer to
B.C.P.A. A Yarrasider, Mills was edu-
cated at Sydney Grammar and Sydney
Uni., where he studied civil engineering
under the Sam McCaughey bequest. Tom
Leech was one of his lecturers; from
him Mills caught the aviation bug and
joined the Uni. Gliding Club, With a
B.Sc. to his credit he went to Britain,
where he spent a couple of years with
De Havillands, returning to Australia in
1939 for the same company at Mascot.
Over six-foot tall, he has been a keen
boxer, with a fighting weight round the
13-stone mark. He’s an associate of the
Royal Aeronautical Society, a member of
the Australian Institute of Engineers and
of the U.S. Institutes of Aeronautical
Science and Automotive Engineers.
“Pawang”: The prospect of mankind’s
worst scourge, influenza, being scotched
has been brought nearer. Professor
F. M. Burnet, director of the Walter and
Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne,
declares that it is now possible to identify
the wog, and that many of its properties
have been discovered. The new concept
is that the ’flu virus attacks the cells
through its own chemical agents, enzymes.
If some other enzyme not a part of a
virus or other disease-producing microbe
could be found which would act on the
cells before the virus enzymes got their
blow in the virus would be immobilised.
This has actually been done with animals.
Professor Burnet inoculated several
thousand Australian soldiers during the
late war in the course of his researches:
Former member of the 10th Light
Horse —he collected a D.C.M. in France
and was mentioned in dispatches—Jack
Nagle, veteran of two world wars, has'
retired from the secretaryship of Wil-
liamstown Racing Club after 20 years.
One of Australia’s best-known turf identi-
ties, he was a former secretary of the
Albury Racing Club.
Into the Silence:
In Sydney, at 76, Harold Laurence Harnett,
Sergeant-at-Arms of the N.S.W. Assembly from
1919 to 1936. A Boer War veteran, he joined
the Parliamentary staff in 1901.
At Lewisham, Wagga, Thomas Arrogan, Old
Digger and grazier, of a well-known Adelong
pastoral family. A familiar figure at country
race-meetings, widely popular, and prominent
in all public activities, he was always loyal
to Adelong, a sturdy patron of local sporting
bodies and R.S.L. projects particularly. In
his youth he was a keen footballer.
In Melbourne, at 51, Captain George
Cockerill, an original Anzac and a son of
George Cockerill, one-time editor of the Syd-
ney “Daily Telegraph.” He was well known
in amateur theatrical circles.
In Melbourne, at 30, Allan William Powell,
Melbourne journalist who was known to most
of Victorian and Riverina farmers.


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Melbn”; My sympathy goes out to
Mayor McNab, of Footscray, in his
endeavors to clear the name of that city
of its unfortunate associations. No sooner
had he succeeded in silencing Tiv.
comedians and radio clowns who use the
name as a synonym for unpleasant odors
than the attack was resumed in another
quarter, the representative of a paper-
manufacturing concern having stated that
“any suggestion that a paper-jnill would
create another Footscray is without foun-
dation.” McNab and his town clerk have
decided that Footscray has had it, and the
only solution of the problem is a Govern-
ment proclamation declaring “Footscray”
to be an obscene word.
* * * *
“Findy”: I agree with all that has been
said on all sides in the discussion on
Rembrandt’s camera technique, Tauber’s
ability to take a steep hill in top and the
Russian composers’ tendency to be a
little left of centre. After all, an oblong
is only a circle pushed out of shape,
things that aren’t equal to one thing are
usually equal to something else, and, as
far as Borgioli is concerned, surely it is
better to have yoved and yost than never
to have yoved at all. If Whistler’s
mother had a bust measurement of 38in.
and was 52in. around the hips, how could
Caruso be expected to confine her within
the narrow limits of the diatonic scale,
even if, like Tauber, he had had the
benefit of shrewd microphone technique?
Careful study of the writings of Sydney
art critics has convinced me that painting
is the most musical of the arts, and no-
one who has ever listened to a Van Eyck
sonata in the 7fin. by lOfin. measure
or even in the less familiar 8.9-h.p. model
could possibly think otherwise. As to
Gigli and his top “Cs,” I am no judge,
but I once saw the poor fellow make a
stratospheric attempt in the Grand
National. He was undoubtedly falsetto ;
he seemed to take it slightly lower than
and a little right of centre and came
hurtling down into Becher’s Brook. His
grey mount sprawled out and a mass of
black, brown and bay hurtled past to a
photo-finish.
* * * *
“Dong”: From far down our lane came
a spluttering roar, followed by a leather-
jacketed motor-cyclist howling along at
around 50. At the same time a
man on a boneshaker was slowly
approaching the junction in the main
street. After the crash the pushbike-
owner was first to get to his feet. He
gave a sad look to his back-wheel spinning
20 yards away and went over to hoist up
the speed king. “You all right?” he
queried. All that the other could man-
age to blubber was “My new bike. Only
had it three days. Look at the mud-
guard.” When patiently asked again
“But are you sure you’re all right,” he
snapped out a “Yair,” “Well, cop this!”
cried the cyclist. Left uppercut, and
beautiful.
* * * *
“Bell Rock”; Light-keepers have more
to fear than loneliness. During savage
gales recently the starving keepers of
Wolf Rock Light, off Land’s End, were
saved by helicopter. Once two keepers
manned each light, but now regulations
make it three. This is the result of a
tragic accident on Small’s Light, off St.
David’s Head, on the Welsh coast. A
full gale was rearing ramparts of water
over the rock, and though no relief
vessel could approach, passing ships re-
ported the light burning correctly and,
seen briefly through the spray sweeping
her balcony, the figure of a man standing
beneath the distress flag. He stood there
for days, hardly seeming to change posi-
tion. The gale blew out, the other half-
crazed keeper was relieved, and the cir-
cumstances of the figure’s vigil were
realised. It was the corpse of the assist-
ant keeper, lashed there by his mate and
frozen stiff. The other had been too
fearful of being suspected of murder to
bury him.

“L.V.S.”: When the time arrived for
our bus to move off the conductor stood
on the kerb and informed us that the bus
was overloaded and would not leave until
some of the passengers got out. Some
wag rose to the occasion and rang the
bell. Off we went, leaving the ticket-taker
putting into practice what he had just
been preaching. By useful work at bell-
ringing on the part of sundry passengers
we reached the city and dispersed without
“Silence in the Court!”
any sign of missing troubador. Reunion
of driver and conductor would have been
worth seeing—and hearing.
* * * *
“Mr. Dribble”: If we are as old as we
feel the burglar who set out on a noc-
turnal mission in Hawthorn (Vic.) re-
cently must have felt particularly
youthful. He forced the window of a
house, held-up the occupants, two
children of seven and 10, and then fled
gaily into the night, clutching as prized
loot “a quantity of comics.”
* * * *
“Suvic”: Can anyone explain a sight
seen only twice in over 500 hours’ flying?
It was in Canada, flying at about 1500
feet, with fairly even and thick stratus
cloud about 100 feet below. The sky
was clear above and the sun slightly be-
hind, the time about 2 p.m. The plane
was an Anson. In the cloud below ap-
peared a perfect spectrum circle, with the
shadow of the plane superimposed, the
wingtips touching the circumference. As
the distance between cloud and plane in-
creased the circle became smaller, but
with colors and plane-shadow more
sharply defined. What caused it? And
please don’t let “Shavia” chip in. I want
an explanation from someone who knows
—not a tail-end Charlie.
* * * *
“L. de R.”: A concert given by pianist
May Clifford at the Assembly Hall was
unique in Melbourne’s musical annals.
The talented young lady had to submit
herself to a severe test. She had to please
not only her audience but Professor
Heinze, music-teacher Lindsay Biggins
and “Age” critic and adjudicator Arthur
Nickson, who, unknown to the audience,
were present. It was the first time an
examination for the Diploma of the
Master School had been extended to a
public performance.
* * * *
“Notis”: This' discussion on pushing
large steamers around with one finger
reminds me of two yarns I once read.
In one some natives trying to steal a
launch were foiled by the owner-captain
standing on the jetty with a boat-hook
firmly fixed at the stern of the launch
and keeping up a strong, ever* resistance.
The explanation given was that as long
as the propeller was kept churning the
water in the same spot it could not de-
velop any driving-power. The other
story told of a Mississippi River captain
who, becoming angry with the keeper of
a gambling den, threatened to pull down
the building. He put a rope round it,
attached one end to his steamboat and
set the engines going. In a very short
time the building began to crack and the
gambler gave in to the captain. Which
writer was romancing? Or is a paddle-
wheel more effective than a propeller in
the circumstances?
* * sfc *
“X.Z.”: “Findy’s” bright young intel-
lectuals (B. 25/2/’4B) were obviously dis-
cussing the English paper set by Sydney
University at its recent matriculation ex-
amination. A record number sat this year,
and by all accounts there’ll be a record
number of failures. .
* * * *
“Nakhoda”: Puritanism isn’t confined
to Christian countries; in fact, Islam has
probably had more Calvins and Savana-
rolas than any other religion. The latest
is Seyd Abol Ghassem Kashani, a des-
cendant of the Prophet, who is endea-
voring to lead the Persian flapper back
to the chador, the insanitary head-to-foot
veil which, until 12 years ago, was com-
pulsory for women. He bases his move-
ment on the Prophet’s discovery that
“Woman was made from a crooked rib
and hence is by Nature crooked and
i should be kept in seclusion.” The rest
i of the s'eyd’s platform has a familiar
ring—he wants the closing of brothels,
night-clubs, bars and public-houses and
! banning from newspapers of pictures of
nude and scantily-clad women.
* * *
“E. & 0.E.”; “Tom” (B. 18/2/’4B) is
right when he calls Australia’s system of
book censorship illogical. For one thing,
it is seldom applied beyond the city, as
anyone who knows country libraries will
agree, I have seen The Decameron high
up on the dusty shelf of a small-town
library, where it had lain undisturbed for
years. Not purposely hidden, for the
librarian was merely “obliging” and
knew nothing about books or censorship,
but because the readers had never heard
of it and would, anyway, prefer some-
thing more modern. The most surprising
finds may reward a search of out-of-the-
way shelves if one is not allergic to dust.
* * * *
“Macnell”: There can be few more
gallant actions in naval annals than the
destroyer Electra’s fight against cruel
odds in the Battle of the Java Sea just
six years ago, when Perth was sunk.
Our destroyers had laid a smokescreen,
behind which the Allied cruisers retired.
Then the Dutch admiral in command
ordered a destroyer attack, Electra, a
four-inch destroyer, became separated
from her consorts and entered the smoke-
screen alone. When she burst through
the other side they were waiting—four
Jap cruisers' and four destroyers. Electra
dug her stern down and, a spurting fan
of spray in her teeth, raced in between
the enemy lines, “A” gun firing to
starb’d, “B” gun to port. The range was
2000 yards—open sights. As she passed
each cruiser her thin hull shuddered under
the vicious upthrust of bursting steel, and
shells smashed her upper structure to a
tangle of tortured metal. But she stag-
gered on, guns firing. A broadside landed
under her bow and a wall of water
erupted over the foc’s’le. The seaboat
changed into matchwood where it hung;
the funnel sheared off and a wall of flame
burst from its mouth. Ammunition was
hurried along the upper deck—between-
decks was laced with fire. Then a Jap
destroyer was hit by “A” gun’s load right
in the magazine and exploded into a
climbing pillar of black smoke. Electra
was stopped now, a sitting target. Sud-
denly “A” gun was lifted into the air and
flung over the side. A cruiser nosed in,
brought guns to bear and let go. The
game little ship withered under the blast,
but fought on until, with the sea lapping
its pedestal, “X” gun, the only one left,
fired its last shot into the innards of the
nearest cruiser. Then she was gone; and
the Japs.' still were firing, but only into
the column of smoke that stood, like
pall, leaning slightly above the sea.
* * * *
“Cond a”: Though the seagoin
strength of the R.N. has been cu
to 16 cruisers and a small num
ber of escort vessels and submarines, th
Service, as always, seems to be in the righ
place at the right time. The anchorin
of three heavily-gunned cruisers in port
as far apart as the Falklands and Belize
in British Honduras, exercised an immedi
ate muzzling effect on “the jackals’ yap
ping.” British bluejackets, landed as
disciplined unit, possess a unique steady
ing influence, I remember a British
political officer in Muscat asking for help
to quieten a threatening mob of Arabs
A cruiser tumbled half her marine com
plement into the pinnace, and the rec-
and-blue platoon headed shorewards
Marines are among the world’s best
drilled troops, and in the bazaar thei
glittering bayonets and deliberate step
acted on the receptive mob like th
desert night on nomadic tents. The ship
sailed next day and carried out gun prac
tice two miles offshore. She returned
week later, but all was quiet.
* * * *
“Spoke”: Europeans are often credited
with an uncanny capacity for picking up
languages, but they can make mistake
like other people. A scientist in Mel
bourne, a refugee from Hitler, decided to
add Russian to his equipment of a dozen
tongues, and found a teacher in anothe
reffo. He progressed so well with hi
lessons that after a few weeks he decider
to try himself out in a cafe run and fre
quented by Russians. The looks of be
wilderment he produced made him won
der if his powers were failing until the
manager tapped him on the arm and saic
in English: “That’s not Russian you’re
talking; it’s Polish.”
* * * *
“Millswyn”: Melbourne police receiver
a nasty jolt recently when several re
sponsible citizens rang and informed them
that the Ku Klux Klan was abroad in
Coburg, the suburb that has the honor
of being the home-town of Pentridge Jail
It proved to be a false alarm; the white-
robed figures were merely revellers from
a fancy-dress ball and not “Imperia
Wizards of the Invisible Empire.”
* * * *
“Jindivick”: Army scrounging? Our
chaps struck trouble when, on the O.C.’s
instructions, they went to a spot marked
on a map to pick up an old motor chassis
and engine for use in the M.T. school.
After much toil they cut the chassis up,
loaded it on a truck and brought it back
to unit lines. They had scarcely parked
their vehicles when a gentleman with a
mean temper and an axe arrived in com-
pany with the assistant provost-marshal
and police sergeant. The salvaged chassis
had been used by its owner as a power-
sawbench unit. The wreck referred to
by the instructing officer was found at the
spot marked on the map—right opposite
the home of the sawbench and over-
grown with scrub. After that we had
strict instructions to quit living off the
countryside.

“Ceg’s” mouth waters:
“Penny ice-cream, please,” said the small
boy. “Don’t serve penny ones,” said the girl
in the shop. So the small boy handed over
his penny and received three small, hard-
looking lollies. It took me back to my boy-
hood, when a ha’penny had real purchasing-
power and threepence was a fortune. Many
will remember the little lolly-shops, usually
kept by an elderly spinster, and the half-
penny case where such a variety was displayed
that the difficulty was to make up one’s mind.
I recall some of my favorites. Chocolate
pistols filled with some sor|i of white stuff;
packets of little pink-and-white “cigarettes
made of sugar; “Tom, Dick and Harry”—
liquorice mice stuck with glue on a card; long
honey, treacle and milk poles. Snowballs covered
with coconut ; packets of sherbert with a pip 6
of liquorice to suck it through. Large blocks
of pink chewing-gum, with a strong flavor, once
tasted never forgotten. Silver Sammies—toffee
covered with chocolate with silver-paper on
one end. Indigestible “tarts” with a centre of
jelly, brightly colored and defying any but the
strongest teeth. Sticks of chocolate wrapped
in silver-paper and liquorice “pipes.” Prus-
packets ranging from a halfpenny to threepence.
“Conversation lollies” with which one could
conduct an elaborate courtship with the girl
next door. Blocks of coconut-ice and flaky
coconut bundles filled with soft sugar, f
could go on long enough to induce the tooth-
ache, which in those days usually followed
if one had any teeth left capable of aching.
Then those little gelatine discs —so useful for
window-mending and the pink-and-white
peppermint walking-sticks. All those lines seem
to be off the market now. And what’s hap-
pened to the packets of Sen Sen— scented
breath-sweeteners —without a few of which m
bis waistcoat-pocket no swain was ready to meet
bis lady friend?.
SOME OF OUR SENATORS.
“Stigmatising as ‘amazing’ Labor’s latest proposal
that a six-year term in Parliament should entitle a
Federal legislator to a pension of £5OO a year for
life, Mr. Menzies added: ‘And you should see some
of the people who get into the Senate!’”
A Senator! That age-old designation
Seems to suggest you should be finding there
Someone of recognised prestige and station,
Grave, dignified and with an ample share
Of ripe experience for his high vocation,
A sort of Elder Statesman, as it were,
Like those old Romans who, so long ago.
Absorbed the eloquence of Cicero.
How very different our modern versions—
A fair proportion of them anyway—
The frothy demagogues who hurl aspersions
Across the floor and blare and bleat and bray,
Relying mainly upon such exertions
To show they’re qualifying for their pay,
And, whensoever they may get the shoot,
A pension, and a thumping one to boot.
State Rights the founders of our Constitution
Designed them for protecting, did they not?
Was ever a more fanciful illusion?
What chance has any chap who hasn’t got
A faction ticket for his contribution
To our Australian Witenagemot?
It’s only party hacks who climb the fence,
Coming from whither and departing whence?
A glimpse at some of them, here’s Ming
implying,
Would make us marvel at the hardihood
That got them into such a satisfying
Encirclement, and possibly it would;
Albeit for myself, there’s no denying,
I doubt ’twould do me any further good
Than reading almost anything they care
To say, or hearing it across the air.
N.S.W.
T. THE R.


“Zake”: It had to come. A New
York seaman listened to a girl play the
song-hit “Bongo, Bongo, Dongo” 20
times on a jukebox, and then the tor-
tured fellow up and shot her. No jury,
unless composed entirely of quarter-
witted jukebox addicts, could possibly
bring in any other verdict than “justi-
fiable homicide,” after which, no doubt,
forgiving him for the sound of his gun,
the Anti-Noise Society would make him
a life member. My contentment will not
be complete, however, until I hear that
some sawny-looking joker with a face
like a lugubrious horse slowly strangles
the snappy-line-of-talk hat salesman who,
after parking a quite unsuitable cady on
the bloke’s dome, stands back and tells
him he’ll feel happy about wearing it.
* * * *
“Nerts-2-ya”: During the past year or
so a yarn has been current in Australia,
substantially like this;
Visitor to institution or annual dinner or
anything you like hears one man yell
“89!” Everybody laughs. Another yells
“24!” Shrieks of laughter. Still another
shouts “45!” Several go into convulsions
of mirth. Visitor is told that the crowd
knows all the jokes in the world and for
convenience sake has numbered them, so
that when a number is called the joke is
instantly identified and laughter follows.
The visitor tries it, calling out “67!”
Nobody laughs. “What’s wrong?” he asks.
“Oh,” says his guide, “the joke was all
right. It was the way you told it.”
Now it turns up in the March, 1948,
“Readers’ Digest,” and is credited to
Bennet Cerf, American humorist, but
with the difference that the visitor was
struck by one man who kept on laugh-
ing at joke 94 and was told “I guess
he never heard that gag before.” Per-
sonally, I think the Australian version
100 p.c. funnier.
* * * *
“Bo”: The latest “purge” among Soviet
composers, who must further Communist
propaganda through their “music,” or
else, is a result of their “bourgeoise con-
ception of music” and their “failure to
express adequately the Soviet way of life.”
If a few well-placed bullets means the
"I'm worried about my husband — I KNOW he'll be
running around with some other girl!”
cutting-off at their source of such caco-
phonic horrors as the Leningrad Sym-
phony, then blessed be the purge. It may
seem peculiar to the Anglo-Saxon mind
that a jumble of crochets and quavers
could be interpreted as a political mes-
sage, yet, strangely enough, England’s
greatest composer, Henry Purcell, once
got himself into a spot of political trouble
throufih a Quickstep he wrote. It
appeared in 1686, when Purcell was 28.
Shortly afterwards James II appointed as
Lord-lieutenant of Ireland General Tal-
bot, the most-hated man in the kingdom.
A bit of doggerel verse entitled “Lilli-
burlero,” attributed to Lord Wharton,
himself later Lord-lieutenant, fitted the
music, and the song, taken up as a rally-
ing cry by the Protestants, had a powerful
influence in the subsequent struggle for
the overthrow of James. It was Wharton’s
boast that the ditty “had sung a deluded
prince out of the three kingdoms.” Dis-
loyalty to his sovereign must have been
far from Purcell’s mind when he wrote
the air, for it came hot on the heels of an
Ode to the King and two anthems for
the coronation.

“P.0.M.C.”: Several doors along our
street lives a brawny bloke who believes
in keeping strictly within the letter of an
ancient law by occasionally trouncing his
wife with a broomstick not more than lin.
thick. A few evenings ago a stranger —
we locals would have known better —
passed by, heard the howls, rushed in,
wrenched the broomstick from the
whacker’s grasp and in seven seconds was
stretched out on the grass—crowned with
a piece of wood • swung. by the brawny
bloke’s victim. This is an old, old story,
of course, but it has a new twist. The
muscular cove’s missus is only a de facto
wife.

“Standish”; Electricity restrictions
always set me wondering how long it will
be before some of our bright boys find
a method of using solar radiation to take
the place of turbines' and generators.
Western Desert-ers will remember the
stills used by the Afrika Corps with their
large reflector mirrors to provide the
energy by catching the rays of the sun.
These were cumbersome brutes, but they
did produce good water from the sea, or
from the brackish waterholes in the wadis.
I once met a Jewish chap, formerly of
Stuttgart University, living in one of the
Hashomer Hatzair settlements, who was
working on a scheme for providing
enough energy to water Palestine by lift-
ing salt water up from the sea and dis-
tilling it by steam evaporation, all opera-
tions to get their energy from captured
solar radiation. I don’t know what has
happened to him ; probably he is waiting
for peace to break out.
* * * *
“Plop”: Obviously too tiny for any-
thing to wear, knitted garments have been
weighing-in from relations ; information
on care and cleaning has come from the
in-laws, and, from one far-sighted aunt,
a book, What to Call the Baby.
Following the sigh of relief on gaining
this veritable dictionary of names, I found
that my own handle, Archibald, means
“extremely bold.” For others who
battled their way through the Third Form
and had their beads thrust under taps to
yells of “pansy” I quote further good
oil:
Algernon, bearded warrior; Aloysius,
famous fighter; Bartholomew, war-like son;
Basil, kingly; Cuthbert, noted splendor;
Marmaduke, mighty noble.
Possibly these nomenclatural atrocities
were devised in older, stoushier days by
warrior fathers wishing to guarantee that
when their children began carting their
stony notebooks to school they would
have to learn to fight.
* * * •
“Jasby”: Perhaps I was a bit hasty in
suggesting (B. 18/2/’4B) that the Russian
mule-breeders who
are going to produce
the fastest race-
horses in the world
by crossing blood-
stock with Mongo-
lian donks would not
need to worry about
studbooks. There
are cases on record
of a mule becoming
a parent, and the
Russkis had obvi-
ously heard of the
latest instance, which
happened in Louisi-
ana last November
when a 20-year-old
hinny, name of Lou,
threw a colt which
resembled her only
about his ears and
hoofs; in other re-
spects he favored his
suspected father, an
aged stallion who
shuffled off before
he had a chance to
deny paternity. A
court case now rag-
ing around the mother and her son has
nothing to do with parentage ; it concerns
ownership. A negro tenant-farmer alleges
he bought Lou for three loads of hay
and an undertaking to do certain work
for the vendor, a dealer in livestock. Not
long after he took delivery of Lou the
old girl, possibly to show her gratitude
at being saved from the boiling-down
works, presented him with the colt. When
the news spread, alleges the negro, the
livestock dealer came along and repos-
sessed mother and son. Negro is claiming
50,000 dollars, or, alternately, the two
animals. The dealer’s story is that he
did not sell Lou, but merely lent her. He
plans to exhibit the unusual pair through-
“Hey! I asked for pineapple, not raspberry !”
out America. He hasn’t stated yet
whether he proposes to take ’em to Russia.

“Clooter”: Amidst the quaking and
quivering of the various world curren-
cies one form of assets stands firm and
unassailable. Better than diamonds, wool
or land, valuable postage-stamps retain
their worth despite wars, the fall of
empires and the violent displacement and
movement of peoples. There are refugees
from stricken Europe who managed to
get out with nothing more than they stood
up in and were quickly established in
other lands, having cashed or obtained
credit for the half-dozen or so stamps
they managed to stitch into their shirts
or hid in their shoe-soles during the flight.
Wherever the possessor of wanted stamps
is today, his stamps represent solid wealth,
whether in sterling, dollar or yen, and
there goes on, unpublicised and behind
the scenes, a world traffic in them the total
annual turnover figures of which would
stagger our Federal Treasurer. It seems
strange that a bare square-inch of colored
paper should attain such eminence, but
then in the world of 1948 the bizarre
has become rather commonplace.

“X.S.”: Marx, or Lenin, or both, said
that religion was the opium of the worker.
One Melbourne firm allegedly has other
views about it. Victoria Dock police re-
cently unearthed a cache of 456 bottles
of beer and wine in a storeroom which
allegedly were being bought and resold
to employees “to keep them happy.”

“Ex-u.G.”: Melbourne “Herald” has
a photographer whose picture of a young
Australian mother with her child, pub-
lished 26/2/’4B, would win any award
for the best human camera-study of the
year and which, if copies of it were sent,
enlarged, to be hung in public places
throughout the nation, might bring the
blush of shame to every Government
housing-authority in the land. The young
woman was photographed at a Melbourne
ballot for 400 houses. She was one of
27,000 applicants, and she didn’t win a
house. She has been living in one room
for three and a half years. She is pic-
tured with her small daughter on her
lap, and the expression of wistful hope
and patience on her young face is so vivid
and arresting that it would move a stone
image. But stone images are soft as putty
compared with the awful hardness of
these authorities, and I suppose the poor
young thing will have to go on being an
innocent subject for sensitive press
cameramen.

“Lawnstob”: Apple Islanders are
agitated about contributions to party
funds, and there is talk of legislation to
stop it. I don’t see why a person should
be prevented from contributing to what
he believes even if what he believes is
bunkum. Just before World War I an
English magnate offered a large sum to
a leading party, the consideration being
a title. The party secretary looked up
the aspiring one’s humdrum record,
scratched his head and said “After
all, before the King can bestow a
title the recipient must have made some
public gesture. You don’t seem to have
even opened a church bazaar.” It was
thereupon decided that the magnate
should present to his town a lifesize
equestrian statue in bronze of a dead
Boer War general, and a sculptor was
commissioned. His masterpiece of
academic art was unfinished when the
Great War arrived and generals became
two a penny. A couple of years later the
party had merged with others in
a united war effort; the magnate was
forgotten and the price of copper had
almost trebled. At this point the magnate
dropped in at the sculptor’s studio and
gloomily contemplated his mass of price-
less metal. “What’s it worth to you if I
buy her as she stands?” he asked.
The sculptor named a figure, a cheque
was drawn, and in due course the effigy
was delivered at Moneybags’ factory.
Nothing further was heard of it. At that
time people were taking down their park
gates and selling them to munitions
works.

“Pitt St.”: From Circular Quay to the
Central Railway in Sydney run three long
streets —Pitt, George and Castlereagh
(almost) —and only one of them is wide
enough to allow two lanes of traffic. All
day long along those three and the short
connecting streets between them moves
the main part of the city’s life. I find
a perpetual fascination in studying the
daily crowds and an evergrowing wonder
as to whither they are going or what they
hope to achieve. To. anyone who cares
to take a stand at a selected spot at the
same time each day from Monday
to Friday it will become apparent
that very many faces pass regularly,
usually in the same direction, and about
the same time. There are, of course,
people whose work takes them to certain
places each day, and they are easily
identified. But round and round go
the idlers, obviously heading nowhere
in particular, obviously with nothing to
do. One would expect that kind of thing
to bore any mildly intelligent person, but
it doesn’t. My own theory is that they
have become the victims of a habit more
tyrannous than drinking or smoking.

“Tummas McN.”: There came into my
hands a copy of the Narrogin “Observer,”
a W.A. country paper of 13/2/’4B, and
mine eye was caught by a three-column
article headed “A Visit to the Eastern
States.” The opening paragraphs were
even more interesting:
The following impressions gained by a
member of our staff during his recent visit
to the East may prove of interest to readers.
They are also written with the object of
providing food for thought and, let us
hope, comment.
Beer, beer and more beer to meet the
ever-increasing demand is obviously the rul-
ing passion it is run a close second by
horse-racing and every other form of sport
in which betting is the chief consideration.
What puzzled the writer—and he isn’t
alone in that —is how the crowds of men
and women in the pubs found the time
to be there. Well, since comment is in-
vited, let us help him;
There is nearly always a strike some-
where, which releases not only strikers, but
others dependent on their products. Rac-
ing and other sports “in which betting is
the chief consideration” support a vast
crowd of moneyed idlers from Saturday to
Saturday. Absenteeism is rife in most in-
dustries ; there is a large number of public-
service employees with nothing to do, and
there is always a large number of people
forced to hang about the city awaiting
long-deferred decisions from their bureau-
cratic masters. There is the 40-hour week.
These are merely some of the reasons.
But the Narrogin man needn’t assume
that only the workers are guilty.
» * ♦ ♦
“First Mate”: Switzerland has launched
its first seagoing ship. Taking advantage
of the Barcelona Convention of 1921,
which empowers countries with no sea-
board to operate merchantmen under
their own flags, Switzerland commissioned
a British shipbuilder to build the General
Guisan. Launched recently at West
Hartlepool by the general’s wife, and
registered at Basle (the limit of navigation
on the Lower Rhine), the General Guisan
is a cargo motorship of 9100 tons and
12 knots. The same builders will con-
struct two 3000-tonners for another Swiss
company.
THE NEW LOOK.
“What is termed the ‘new look’ is really a re-
Tgval of the modes of the ’seventies and ’eighties, the
fashions of our grandmothers’ time.” —Sydney paper.
The new look, the new look!
You’ll hear its manifold
Attractions eagerly discussed
Wherever clothes are sold.
It comes as something of a shock
To be abruptly told
What’s billed as new is merely a
Revival of the old.
The new look, the new look!
Long since it had its hold
Upon the hosts of female forms
Whose contours it controlled.
Three-quarters of a century
Upon its way has rolled,
And now it’s back, the new look,
So definitely old.
The new look, the new look!
Wasp-waists, curves bulging bold
Below, bell-skirts—.all that you’ll find
In old-time “Punches” scrolled.
Our grand-dads saw them, and you bet
It didn’t leave them cold.
They had their hour and went their way
Ere good Queen Vic. grew old.
The new 109 k, the new look!
It seems, if votes were polled,
’Twould top them as a novelty
Among the wiles and charms whereby
The stoutest bats are bowled.
The lure and glamor claimed for it
May still be good as gold,
But what is there accounted new
From witching woman’s point of view
That isn’t (really) old?

Easily the best showing since the co. —
it is in the highly-competitive men’s-wear
business, specialising in manufacture of
shirts, collars, pyjamas, etc. —took over
the Pearson Law business in Melbourne
36 years ago. The leap in turnover was
no less than 38.6 p.c., thanks largely to
alleviation of labor and other problems
by decentralised manufacture and partly
to a satisfactory supply of cotton
materials, which the co. buys chiefly from
Britain.
Output of the main factory at
Richmond (Vic.) is supplemented by the
products of subsidiary units at Franks-
tdn (Vic.), Sydney (N.S.W.) and Sand-
gate (Q.) —the lastmentioned began pro-
duction shortly after the close of latest
accounts —thus eliminating many vexa-
tious transport difficulties as well as re-
ducing the freight item in overhead.
Selling prices are controlled by official
edict, and, since the co.’s products enter
into the cost-of-living regimen, a Gov-
ernment subsidy looks after rises in the
imported cost of cotton materials.
The larger turnover sent gross earn-
ings up £26,924;

There was no slackening in the rate of
advance of wage and other costs (up
£18,630). For the gain of £8294 in net
earnings, shareholders can largely thank
abolition of the War-time (Co.) Tax. The
£33,737 of profit was sufficient to give
the prefs. their full contract rates and
show 15.6 p.c. on average ord. capital,
compared with 11.4, 9.8, 8.7, 6.9, 3.7 and
6.1 p.c. back to 1941. The div. was
lifted from 6 p.c. to 7\ p.c., making the
average over the last nine years 4.7 p.c.
For the nine years before that the ords.
went hungry, slump having caught the
co. with heavy stocks and book debts
that had to be worked down at the worst
possible moment in order to reduce the
outside debt, while the hand-to-mouth
policy of retailers and exchange and tariff
adjustments aggravated the position.
As a hedge against the growing dollar
shortage, increasing scarcity of cottons
from Manchester and further price rises,
the co. bought heavily before the close
of last accounts, as the following com-
parison of balance-sheet figures shows:
1940. 1945. 1946. 1947.

To carry an extra £118,257 of stocks and
£133,452 of book debts, the board had
gone to its bankers and others for an
additional £165,044 at end of December
last. The improvement of £70,818 in the
more-or-less liquid surplus (£219,149) was
due mainly to introduction of fresh
capital.
Because part of the larger turnover
looks like holding in the future, and be-
cause present banking policy (now con-
trolled by the Government) is that trade
expansion should be financed by new
share capital rather than bank overdraft,
those on the ord. register at Sept. 10 last
were offered 110,000 new 10s. ords., one-
for-four, at par. The £55,000 thus re-
ceived lifted paid capital to £299,736 in
29,736 A 7 p.c. and 50,000 B 9 p.c. prefs.,
all of £1 each, and 440,000 10s. ords. On
that lot pref. divs. and 7\ p.c. to the ords,
will call for £22,825, or £10,855 less than
was netted last term.
As for the outlook, the fight promises
to be one mainly against rising costs, the
immediate effects of which have been
obscured by prevailing world shortages
and high prices. The three main factors
governing profits today are (1) turnover,
(2) gross margins and (3) costs. With
costs advancing and gross margins re-
ceding, profit has become mainly a func-
tion of turnover. When turnover gets
into reverse gear, as eventually it will,
the Prices Commissioner will need to
revise his present policy of progressively
shaving gross margins, if serious trouble
is to be averted.
At 15s. 9d. (13s. 3d. a year ago) the
ords. return 4.8 p.c. on a 7\ p.c. div.
basis. The A shares at 30s. and the Bs,
at 40s, yield 4.7 p.c. and 4.5 p.c, re-
spectively, and their combined divs. were
over five times covered by last year’s
net earnings. Net tangible backing is
£l2 3s. A shares, £6 12s. Bd. Bs, and
13s. 3d, ords.

All-round expansion of business, a
record profit, maintenance of the div. and
bonus at 10 p.c. on higher capital, and
a new share issue were the outstanding
features of the latest accounts of this 51-
year-old manufacturer and distributor
of office requisites and commercial
stationery, etc. It has factories in all
States except Tas., where a sales branch
at Hobart looks after the local market,
and a close association exists with the
Lamson organisation in U.S. and Europe.
Demand for the co.’s products, which
can be taken as a reflection of business
activity generally, sent gross earnings up
£41,002, or 36.5 p.c.:

Exes., which got a little benefit from
abolition of War-time (Co.) Tax, included
an extra £lO,OOO for taxation (£25,000),
an extra £2620 for depreciation (£10,811)
and an extra £1465 for the staff fund
(£4197). The net gain of £5877 lifted
profit to 15 p.c. on average capital as
against 13, 13.8, 15.1, 14, 12 and 13.1 p.c.
back to 1941. For the 11 years to the
close of last accounts shareholders re-
ceived a regular 10 p.c., sweetened with
£12,500 of bonus scrip and three new
share issues at a premium of ss. in each
case. For the seven difficult slump years
before that divs. averaged 5.5 p.c., pre-
ceded by an average of 9| p.c. for the
20 years back to 1910, which is the point
at which the public became interested.
To help put up two new factories —one
at Edmondstown (near Adelaide), now
completed, and the other at Kingsgrove
(near Sydney), on which a start is to be
made 500n —93,750 new £1 shares were
issued, one-for-two, at a premium of ss.
each in June last. When the books closed
the share premiums (£23,438, which has
been added, to reserves) and £24,478 of
the new capital had come in. The remain-
ing £69,272, to be called as required, will
lift paid capital to £281,250’, on which
10 p.c. will call for £1254 less than was
netted last term.
Before announcement of the new issue
the old f.-p. pound shares stood at 58s. in
the market, giving the scrip at ex-rights
value of 475. After sales at 525., buyers
recently offered 50s. without attracting
sellers. The return at 525. is 3.8 p.c. on
a 10 p.c. div. basis, and there is nothing
in sight at the moment to indicate that
the 10 p.c. distribution is likely to be
interferred with. Including uncalled
capital, net tangible cover is 295. 9d. per
share.
Expansion of the business is further
reflected in balance-sheet figures:

To add £16,191 to the book value of
premises, £35,502 to plant and carry an
extra £4524 of book debts and £48,589
of stocks the co. went outside for a
further £47,720 last term. That was
in addition to the new capital and share
premium money. There was a contraction
of £8287 in the more-or-less liquid
surplus (£177,600) owing to the outlay on
fixed assets.

What has happened here? Like most
other manufacturers the co.—it has 10
factories scattered throughout the Com-
monwealth and Maoriland that turn out
concrete-lined steel pipes from plates
fabricated by B.H.P. for water-supply
schemes, etc. —has the overflowing order-
book that goes with a sellers’ market.
Output, however, depends upon the
supply of steel plates, which in turn de-
pend upon a sufficiency of coal and ade-
quate labor force. Because of the coal
and labor problems, plates were in such
short supply last term that the factories
operated at less than 50 p.c. capacity.
That also meant disproportionate over-
head, which substantially reduced net
earnings. These were further affected
by a lockout at the co.’s Melbourne
factory early in the term and by unprofit-
able contracts in Maoriland.
After allowing £5OOO (down £13,000)
for taxation and £20,3)37 (up £5620) for
depreciation, there was an abrupt con-
traction of £23,479 in the net result
(£9107), which was the poorest since 1936.
It was a mere 1.8 p.c. on the £500,000 of
capital (half 7\ p.c. cum. prefs. and the
other half ords.), and reserves had to be
drawn upon for £7768 to pay the pref.
div. The ords., which were again passed
by, have had only five lots of 2\ p.c. since
the co. was formed in 1923, when the
parent Hume Pipe Co. and W. R. Hume
were handed 165,000 and 85,000 paids
respectively for rights. The public put
up the cash by subscribing for pref.
shares—the last 100,000 of them, issued at
end 1945, carried an unjustified premium
of 7s. 6d. each at the direction of the
Treasury, thus reducing the actual return
on this lot to 51 p.c. *
Over the last couple of years the co.
has spent a lot of money on expanding
and modernising its factories in anticipa-
tion of a heavy demand for pipes. But
until sufficient steel becomes available
these plants will have little opportunity of
earning satisfactory profits. How soon
that will be depends in no small measure
upon the Government, whose plans for
increased coal production have thus far
produced totally inadequate results.
Prospects of more regular though
moderate divs. to the ords., which would
help swell the earnings of Hume Pipe,
have been thus pushed further into the
future. And this at a time when the
board’s policy of building up reserves as
an alternative to paying ord. divs.
looked like bearing fruit. The ords. can
now see practically the whole of their
capital intact, whereas 20 years ago it
was all represented by intangibles.

The co.’s big silver-lead-zinc- and copper-
ore deposits are at Mt. Isa (N.Q.), arid
American Smelting and Refining Co. and
Mining Trust have a controlling interest
in the venture. The ore is treated on the
spot, and has been since 1931. The pro-
ducts are railed to Townsville, whence the
silver-lead bullion is shipped for treatment
at Britannia refinery (a subsidiary of
Mining Trust) near London, the zinc con-
centrates are shipped and sold overseas,
and the blister copper goes to Port
Kembla (N.S.W.), where it is refined and
sold locally.
The management has put up an excel-
lent technical performance, but slump,
anaemic metal markets, advancing costs
and other troubles robbed shareholders
of an early return on their money. Owing
to war-time shipping and other prob-
lems, production was switched from
silver-lead-zinc to all-copper in April,
1943. Since the end of hostilities ready
markets at high prices for all base metals
have greatly enhanced the co.’s pros-
pects. Shareholders got their first div.
(10 p.c.) in July last from profits equal
to 25.8 p.c. on average capital for the
year to end June, 1947. The £502,585
(up £353,175) of profit was written after
payment of debenture interest (£176,004)
and allowing £222,099 (up £88,303) for
depreciation.

Copper production was sus-

won’t be resumed on a large
scale until the new copper-mil-
ling and -smelting programme is
complete. The last was the first
full year’s operation on lead-
zinc ore since 1943.
Metal production over the last
six years has been as follows:

Last year’s metals came from

nearly all complex sulphides
assaying 5.50 z. silver, 7.8 p.c.

Factors affecting last year’s
figures were lifts in the basic
wage totalling 1 Is. a week, short-
age of coal and consequent use
of 2773 tons fuel oil —on a
B.T.U. basis it cost 2.8 times as
much as coal—shortage of skilled
labor, higher freight rates and
rise in the price of stores. In-
troduction of the 40-hour week
will bump up the current year’s
costs by something more than
10 p.c.

A lot more payable stuff is be-

zinc occurrences.
Shortly before the close of
accounts longstanding loans
from American Smelting and Re-
fining, Mining Trust and
Britannia Lead, aggregating
£696,691, were redeemed by
issue of 557,353 new f.-p, pound

Since the close of accounts
1,944*,202 new £1 shares —th©
issue was underwritten by
American Smelting and Refining
—were put out at par, one-for-
one. When all the money is in
paid capital will be £4,445,757,
on which 10 p.c. will call for
£58,009 less profit than was
shown last year.
The new money is wanted to
help finance installation of (1)
mining, milling and smelting
plant for copper, (2) refining
equipment for blister copper and
for (3) exploration and develop-
ment of the co.’s own coal de-
posit at Oxley Creek and (4)
housing and amenities. If the
hunt for coal is successful it will
mean a saving of £40,000-or-
more a year to the co. All
major items of new plant are on
order, but installation is held up
by delays in delivery. When
complete, the new equipment is
scheduled to handlejso,oob tons
copper sulphides for an output
of 1500 tons blister a month.
Annual metal production is ex-
pected to reach 2,775,0000 z.
silver, 37,000 tons lead, 24,000
tons zinc and 18,000 tons blister
copper. Costs should also
benefit from the bigger through-
put and increased mechanical
efficiency.
Mindful of the co.’s difficulties,
the high and rising level of costs,
the possibility of adjustment in
the Australia-London exchange
rate, of the uncertainty of metal
prices in the future and the size
of the debenture debt, the market
cautiously prices the shares at
395. 6d. The return at the figure
is 5 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis,
with possibilities of better in the
near future.


Consideration for
one’s dependents
THE lack of a Will has caused many a man’s
Estate to be tied up while his family needed
money—perhaps urgently.
A home-made Will has often caused more trouble than
no Will at all.
You can prevent this. See your Solicitor now. Tell
him your wishes and ask him to draw your Will. This
will entail the appointment of an Executor to administer
the Estate. Upon your Executor’s trustworthiness and
ability your beneficiaries will be entirely dependent.
Write for a copy of the booklet “Your Executor and
Trustee” which describes the services rendered in this and
other capacities by Perpetual Trustee Company, Limited
—and its charges.

Government Shipping
Since its inception in 1941 the
Commonwealth Shipping Board,
in its requisitioned-tonnage sec-
tion, had lost £8,608,511 up to
June 30 last. This is mostly in
respect of coastal vessels requisi-
tioned from owners but left
under their management, owners
receiving a charter payment and
a fixed percentage of voyage
receipts. Before the Common-
wealth Government interfered
with the control of these ships
the companies invariably made
good profits, but since 1941 the
position has deteriorated rapidly,
and the decline may be said to
have started from the time the
44-hour week was introduced to
the industry (by National
Security Regulation !) in 1942,
Since then operations of the
industry have been subject to
constant Communist obstruction,
both at sea and on the wharves.
And the Chifley Government
had “played ball” with the
Corns, all through the piece.
War-risk bonuses are still being
paid, and costs have soared
on every hand, while the turn-
round and loading rate of ships
have become much slower. Hav-
ing allowed the industry to be
brought to its present pass the
Commonwealth is now handing
back the coastal ships to their
owners.
The Commonwealth still
operates a Government-owned
and chartered-tonnage section.
At June 30 last this comprised
12 River-class freighters, six
“D”-class freighters and M.V.
Reynella, an Italian prize. These
ships were used, amongst other
things, to handle Government
tasks during the war, and they
were made to “pay” simply by
the Government debiting the
Army, Navy or other war de-
partment with more than enough
to cover the heavy cost of oper-
ating the ships. They made a
profit, or at any rate accumu-
lated a “credit balance,” of
£5,333,342 up to June 30, 1947,
during the last year of the period
apparently making a loss.
In 1945-46 the “surplus” was
£457,926. This, says Auditor-
General Joyce, “shows a con-
siderable reduction” on the figure
for 1944-45, the Directorate of
Shipping attributing the drop to
“the changeover from war-time
conditions and the national
necessity for the vessels to be
used for unprofitable cargoes
and in the coastal trade instead
of on overseas voyages. Re-
duction 'in coal freights and
iron-ore freights (River-class
vessels) and delays in turn-
around at ports have been other
contributing factors.”
What a blessing “war” was
to Government departments is
seen even in the 1945-46 ac-
counts of this Canberra ship-
ping branch. The surplus from
“operational voyages, South-
west Pacific,” was £988,063, that
from other “overseas voyages”
£107,746; but “coastal deficits”
—enter Comrades Elliott and
Healy—were £628,472. There
was a deficit of £229,771 on
“chartered vessels” in addition,
and the net bunce received from
the Government itself —paid for
out of taxes —was reduced to
£457,926. This year bunce and
all appears to have gone down
the drain and an all-over loss
shown. Anyway, the total
“credit balance” of £5,644,684 at
June, 1946, had fallen to
£5,333,342 at June, 1947.
£358-million ‘‘Works” Plan
The National Works Council,
Canberra, has a £358-million
plan for public works ready on
paper for the time when
unemployment starts to
become evident through-
out the land. It covers
water-conservation, build-
ing, railways, etc., in what
proportions undisclosed
as yet, and the practica-
bility of which is not
yet evident. This country
is urgently in need of
developmental works
plans, based on require-
ments and manpower and
materials available ; but
“works’* plans need to
give consideration to
more factors than the unem-
ployment position, party politics,
socialistic intent and bureaucratic
ambitions. Private enterprise
must be given its right priority
in the planning.
During the latter stages of the
war knight Harry Brown, as
Director - General of Public
Works, was moved to comment
on the surprising inadequacy of
“Labor” Government works
“plans” up to that time. The
fact that the £358-million scheme
is put forward as an unemploy-
nient-absorber casts doubt on its
real value in view of Canberra’s
addiction to mere payroll forms
of employment; but the propo-
sition, on the face of it, is
worthy of the widest public and
expert debate, and more should
be told about it.
Wheat Price
“Labor’s” internal arrange-
ments with regard to the “stabi-
lisation” of wheat prices were
summarised in B. 21 /1 / ’4B. Now
“Labor’s” representatives have
signed a 36-nation wheat agree-
ment which will, upon Parlia-
mentary ratification, bind
Canada (230 million bushels a
year), the U.S.A. (185 million
bushels) and Australia (85 mil-
lion bushels) to acceptance of a
maximum price of two Canadian
dollars a bushel for an export
quota of the amount indicated
in parentheses for five years
from August 1 next, with a
minimum price of $1.50 in the
first year, declining by 10 cents
a year to $l.lO cents in the fifth
year.
The estimated maximum, in
Australian money, is 11s. 6d.
to 12s. a bushel (against 17s* to
20s. at present), and the mini-
mum 6s. to 6s. 6d. Most, or all,
of current wheat-export con-
tracts made at a higher price
will be affected by the agree-
“Very reprehensible conduct! And THEN what did
he do ?”
ment, if ratified. But the deal
with New Zealand at ss. 9d.
will no doubt stand, and the
lower internal price will, of
course, remain.
It appears that world authori-
ties expect a decline in the price
of wheat before very long—one
good season in Europe would
start a slide—and an averaging
of the price would benefit con-
sumer countries now.
Toys and Houses
When Lines Bros. (N.Z.),
Ltd., Maoriland subsidiary of
Lines Bros., Ltd., London,
the world’s biggest toy-manufac-
turers, gets fully into iljs stride
toys will be only a second or
third string to its bow. Since
the new co. got a footing last
year by swallowing up Joy Toys,
Ltd., it has discerned beckoning
opportunities in housing con-
struction on standardised lines
that lifted the parent co. to
prosperity in the toy field.
Present sky-high housing costs
in Maoriland give any concern
that can cut exes, and speed-up
building a chance to romp
ahead. If toymaking holds the
secret to more and cheaper
homes, Lines Bros, might start
something in M.L. In a hurry
to get going, the co. secured a
Government store built in war
days at Mount Wellington, near
Auckland, with enough floor-
space for the plant from its city
factory and new equipment
lately landed from U K.
Perambulators and bicycles
may rank second to housing-
parts. Anticipating the move,
capital was doubled from
£60,000 to £120,000 last De-
cember, with the parent co.
holding three-quarters of the
shares. Profit for the year ended
August last was £2201, against
£1553 in 1946, but there’s no
div. (5 p.c. in 1946), as directors
want all funds to put the new
plant into production. Turnover
jumped 85 per cent., and is going
higher.
Britons on record-low butter
rations can thank New Zealand
that they’re not lower, for
Maoriland today is doing more
than all the rest of the world
put together to help John Bull
hold the line on the butter front
While other suppliers have been
slipping back, M.L. has forged
ahead, and now towers unchal-
lenged above all. Australia, in
second place, is sending less than
one ton for every two from
Maoriland ; and Denmark, great
pre-war rival of the Empire’s
leader in the butter trade, has
dropped back to a poor third.
M. shipments are climbing to-
wards the pre-war peak of
130,000 tons reached in 1938,
and, if outputs don’t slump too
much in the autumn, might set
an all-time record. So far yields
10 p.c. higher than a year ago
give a good margin, but M.L.’s
dry summer is now hitting pro-
duction. Here are figures which
tell the story of butter from
John Bull’s end:

all sources 9,517,913 4,226,081 4,325,825
The Maoriland percentage of
total British imports is striking
indeed.
* * * *
During the middle of last
year, in Washington, Eric John-
ston, formerly president of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
now a big figure in the film-
distribution business, told a
Bulletin man that within three
years Britain would again be
mistress of the, commercial seas.
Events are rapidly justifying the
forecast. It appears that by
1949 the British shipping in-
dustry expects to have fully re-
gained its pre-war dimensions,
tonnage even now being close
to the 1939 figure. Though it
has been a slow process restor-
ing British passenger liners after
long use as war vessels —it is
estimated that some of the
“Strath” ships cost the P. and
O. (or the British Government)
as much to refit as it did origi-
nally to build them —the pace
has been much faster than in
the United States, where it ap-
pears that it will take at least
another year to put the luxury
Matson liners into commission.
British shipyards have also been
launching new vessels, and the
earnings of the mercantile
marine must already be turning
in a tidy sum —a good deal of
it dollars, especially from the
Cunarders —that does not ap-
pear in the monthly export
figures of the Old Country. Even
if the United States has an enor-
mous export trade, British bot-
toms are doing a lot of the
carrying.

Lefeaux Speaks Again
Former top banker and ex-
governor of Maoriland’s Reserve
Bank, Leslie Lefeaux has given
another of his periodic warn-
ings to Maorilanders about the
trend of things. He says M.L.
is something like a cyclist riding
downhill with a following wind,
who might have to battle against
the wind when he gets on the up-
grade. Maorilanders have been
living softly for years, and they
can’t expect this to go on much
longer. They have had big
money-incomes, big wages and
short hours, but these don’t
make a high standard of living,
says Lefeaux from’ experience in
holding financial reins. He
wants M.L. to wake up, but
finds it hard to get a hearing.
Like others who forecast
rainy days, he is brushed aside
as just another prophet of
gloom. Nearly two years ago
he tried to rouse Maorilanders
to three dangers that he sees
nearer now. He said then (1)
beware of having too many
people in unproductive occupa-
tions living on the rest; (2) don’t
think people are rich merely if
they have money in their pockets
or in banks, because money is
useless unless there are goods
and services to buy; (3) don’t
spend too much on enjoyment,
here and now, of consumer
goods, but set aside enough capi-
tal for the future. Businessmen
will agree that this is good coun-
sel, and every successful business
is run much on these lines; but
it’s not so easy to get the rank-
and-file to take the long view.
If a blizzard sweeps in it
won’t be any use running to
John Bull for a loan asi Maori-
landers did last time, says
Lefeaux. He’s been to Britain
lately and should know. Will
Maorilanders take any more
notice of him than last time?
Dollar Loan Gone
On March 1 Britain drew the
last £25 million sterling remain-
ing in its doffar-loan account
with the U.S.A. The loan was
originally $4400 million (£llOO
million sterling), but $650 mil-
lion was earmarked to offset the
balance claimed to be owing by
Britain in respect of lend-lease.
The actual amount Britain had
to draw upon was about £937
million ; and of this a good deal
went in the conversion of
foreign countries’ sterling hold-
ings into dollars after July 1,
1947. The amount of the loan
that Britain was able to spend
on U.S. goods for reconstruction
and sustenance was considerably
below £937 million.
The loan was exhausted within
months ; it was intended to
last from three to five years.
Repayment of the whole
£llOO million is scheduled to
start from December 31, 1951 ;
interest begins to accrue at 2 p.c.
from that year. The final repay-
ment may be made in the year
2001, but Britain, if able, is en-
titled to repay in fewer than the
50 annual instalments stipulated.
The rapid exhaustion of the
loan is attributed to the rise in
prices of U.S. goods after the
deal was negotiated, to the
attempt to make sterling con-
vertible before confidence in
British financial stability had
been restored, and to the lag in
Britain’s trade recovery, parti-
cularly with “hard-currency”
countries. The socialist experi-
ment undoubtedly figured pro-
minently behind the whole mis-
carriage of plans.
Britain’s gold reserves are now
reputed to amount to about £450
million sterling. Some of the
holdings have been sold in recent
months. The United Kingdom
may also draw on its quota of
dollars in the International
Monetary Fund. But the time
has obviously come for addi-
tional help to be offered by
America under the Marshall
plan, otherwise there must be a
“last-ditch” stand on the sterling-
dollar front.
Coal in Maoriland
Since the New Zealand Gov-
ernment bought out the West-
port Coal Co., Ltd., last June at
a cost of £900,000 it has had cold
feet over nationalisation of coal-
mines, and other cos. are in the
dark about their future. In last
August’s Budget Finance Minis-
ter Walter Nash earmarked
£2,500,000 to buy coalmines,
with, probably, nearly a third of
the sum needed to complete the
deal with Westport Coal; but
nothing further has happened.
“The Government has had the
assets of the Waikato coal cos.
valued for its own purposes,”
said chairman Hector Morpeth,
of Pukemiro Collieries, a 38-
year-old concern, at the annual
meeting in Auckland, “but no
negotiations for sale have taken
place except for a preliminary
talk with one company. No bill
for nationalisation was intro-
duced last year, as forecast, and
it would appear the Govern-
ment prefers to acquire by nego-
tiation.”
This may be the cos.’ view—
or hope—but if the State sits
back they’ll have to carry on
under control, with soaring
costs and subsidies. Morpeth
said costs jumped from 18s. syd.
a ton in 1942 to 30s. sd. last
year for his co., and other chair-
men have told a similar story.
In 1942 the subsidy was a mere
Is. a ton. In 1947 it was
13s. 3d., and ceiling isn’t touched
yet. The four Waikato cos. —
Pukemiro, Taupiri, Glen Afton
and Renown —operate six of the
nine major coalfields in Maori-
land not owned by the State.
Together they produce 2000 tons
daily. Their capital aggregates
£452,000, and combined assets
at balance-sheet value last year
were £894,748.
Investors, anticipating State
purchase, boosted coal shares on
the market until confidence had
a jolt when nationalisation was
shelved in mid-spring. For
more than three months holders
have been wondering whether
they’ll get their purchase-money
back.
A tax-free return of 3.5 p.c.
will be obtained from Sargood
Gardiner ords. bought at 40s.
each if last year’s dividend is
maintained. Last term the div.
was taxable in shareholders’
hands, being paid from current
profits instead of from the tax-
paid reserves (£225,661) carried
over from the co.’s non-public
earnings. Now shareholders
have reached an agreement
whereby 38 p.c. of these reserves'
are allocated to pref. share-
holders for future dividends and
the remaining 62 p.c. to ord.
holders. On the basis of the
last distributions (5 p.c. and 7
p.c. respectively) this means that
pref. dividends for the next three
years and ords, for the next five
years will be tax-paid. At the
first general meeting as a public
co. held recently, the chairman
said it was intended to erect a
new factory at Dee Why (near
Sydney) to manufacture “many
lines of men’s-wear” ; land had
been bought, but Canberra was
not yet prepared to release the
necessary building materials.
The possibility of an eventual
increase in capital suggests it-
self ; last July the co. owed
£236,813 to secured creditors
and had a cash balance of
£6116.

SUNDRY SHOWS
"O Hell!"
Before it is too late let us take
Shakspeare and put him where
he’s safe —seal him up in a time-
capsule for a thousand years so
that some gardening play-pro-
ducer might dig him out and
say “This man is good,” and
treat him with accordant rever-
ence.
In “A Midsummer Night’s
Dream,” produced by Mayne
Lynton at Sydney Royal as a
bracer for school-examination
candidates, whole passages were
hewn out in order to save time,
and the tatters that remained
hung limp and damp as the cast
took turns in trying to make
them flutter. Mayne Lynton, as
Egeus, the brittle father of
young Hermia, spoke dead
words that he can make glowing
coals. “O hell!” says Hermia,
echoing the thoughts of many,
and wisely beats it for the
woods.
Before we can go with her,
escape from this Athens, and
see what’s doing out there
among the oaks, we are shown
Bottom and the “players” taking
scripts for their “most lament-
able comedy,” This at least
ought to be good, for Bottom
should be the jewel of the play.
He has a part calling for great
comedy talent and rare buf-
foonery, which actors like Oscar
Asche took all their time in
doing. Here we see Bottom and
the thickskins stumble woefully
—they were meant to, and at
least they do it on purpose, but
why should Augustus Neville,
portraying Bottom, sound so
like Chifley on a Budget speech?
Hurry, before the ruins fall
about us, and find out how
things go with Hermia, out
among the timber, sitting on
some wild thyme. What’s this?
Fairies thundering by like herds
of elephants? And one in par-
ticular singing in a glass-crack-
ing trill “The cowslips tall her
pensioners be”? Can this be
the “Dream” we have heard of,
like something gossamer swim-
ming in moonbeams? By heck
it is—it says so on the pro-
gramme. If our girths would
allow it we could join the
frightened elves who “crept into
acorn cups and hid them there.”
Here comes Bottom again,
muffled by his ass’s head:
The throstle with his note so true,
The wren with little quill.
To which he might almost
have added:
So, people of Australia,
I introduce this bill.
“What angel wakes me from
my flowery bed?” says Titania,
doped, and therefore blameless.
Had it been Oscar Asche her “I
pray thee, gentle mortal, sing
again,” might have been in
order. As things stood, how-
ever, she could have far more
feasibly called to Moth and
Mustard Seed: “Take this
leather-head away and bring me
some beer.”
Then Oberon, flapping his
wings like a flying gurnard, and
with him Puck, his messenger.
At last we can clap. In Puck,
played by , Irene Hilder,, we find
a being sparkling, agile as a
frog and rendering lines that
effervesce as they should, full of
all the mischief ever thought of.
"Rigoletto."
There is no doubt that Aus-
tralian opera is making a do of
it at Melbourne Princess, which
in three weeks has become as
fashionable as His Majesty’s at
the height of a Melba season.
“Rigoletto,” which was added
to the procession last week, was
distinguished by an excellent in-
terpretation by Robert Simmons
of the hunchbacked jester who
acts as pandar to his ducal
master, only to find that he has
made himself a good audience
for the seduction of his daughter.
He neither underdid nor over-
stated the malignant fury, the
baffled hate and the affection for
Gilda of the crumpled creature,
and he gave him a voice which
completely fulfilled the de-
mands of his feelings. Felicia
Francis was a suitably unsophis-
ticated Gilda, and her clean
enunciation made her caressive
tones pleasant to listen to.
John Tilbrook’s duke left
nothing to be desired from the
vocal standpoint, and his sing-
ing of that pet of all operatic
tenors, “Donna e Mobile,” was
up to concert standards ; but his
gay disregard for the conven-
tions was mainly verbal.
This early example of Verdi
has all the germs of the mature
work of the master, and the
famous quartet between Rigo-
letto, Gilda, Sparafucile and
Maddalena, factually as ridicu-
lous as any opera librettist ever
made ’em, is musically as com-
plex as' anything he wrote later.
Under the direction of Dr. Her-
man Schildberger, who took
over the baton from Joseph
Post, it was remarkably well
rendered, as were the choruses
of courtiers and ladies.
From one point of view
“Rigoletto” is insensate melo-
drama, but, being from the pen
of Victor Hugo, it is probably
an authentic picture of the
morals of the Renaissance. The
risible incident of the Body in
the Bag at the final curtain has
never been successfully put over
by any operatic company, and,
in fact, a company of arch-
angels couldn’t do it. In the
Australian presentation the final
duet between the expiring Gilda
and her heartbroken father was
mercifully omitted.
"Possessed."
Most psychiatrists in Sydney’s
Macquarie-street have w’aiting-
lists a yar d long, .a situation
which seems to be pretty com-
mon throughout the world. It’s
a sad com ment on this day and
age> an fi a sadder one that our
entertainers have fastened on to
fi to keep the sausage-machine
grinding out the moneymaking
celluloid. There has been a
string of films in which heroes,
heroines and villains have been
depicted in varying stages of in-
sanity ; some of them have beer
ridiculous beyond conviction
while others have had sufficien
of Hollywood’s pseudo-realism
to take in the impressionable,
who seem to base most of their
existences, from hair-styles to
moral values, on what they see
at the “pitchers.”
The latest offering of this
kind is “Possessed,” at Sydney
Regent. Briefly, it presents Joan
Crawford as a highly-strung
young woman hurling herself at
the head of Mr. Van Heflin
who, with considerable wisdom
and justification it would seem
from the Crawford’s behavior,
wipes her very smartly. This
sows the seeds of insanity in the
Crawford’s noddle, and she is
thereafter depicted as slowly
going mad, what time she
marries a wealthy businessman
(Raymond Massey), gives him
more worry than he deserves,
and finally murders Mr. Van
Heflin, who has retained his
place in the proceedings by be-
coming engaged to the Craw-
ford’s stepdaughter. The Craw-
ford herself is last seen locked
up in the mental ward of a
general hospital, as unpleasant a
spectacle as any mentally-
afflicted person can be.
Miss Crawford plays her part
with heavy realism and occa-
sional flashes of sensitive under-
standing, and Massey attends to
his part with his usual clinical
accuracy. Mr. Van Heflin
ambles through the doings
apparently never quite sure
whether he is meant to be the
villain of the piece or, like the
audience, an unfortunate and
undeserving victim.
It is of melancholy interest to
reflect that there is a film cen-
sorship which worries about an
inch or two of the human torso
and is apparently oblivious to
the blatant exhibition of other
facets of human existence in-
finitely less suitable for general
entertainment. “Possessed” is a
romanticised version of mental
instability ; despite an occasional
touch of realism, it has little
artistic content and less enter-
tainment value, and the main
effect of it and films like it is to
start silly young teenagers who
are dumped by their boy-friends
dramatising themselves as
“psycho” cases,
Sydney Minerva seems to have
committed the offence of putting
on a light comedy, uninhibited
by serious consideration of
politics, social problems or any
of the “isms.” “Off the Record,”
by lan Hay and Stephen King
Hall, is one of those typical
tangled confections which have
been running on the English
stage for years without losing a
shred of their popularity. This
one concerns the naval lieuten-
ant-commander and a socialist
M. who swap jobs for a while
and produce enough complica-
tions to keep the piece on its
feet and the audience pleasantly
amused for three acts. Like all
of its kind, the play needs in-
habiting rather than acting, and
there is no apparent reason for
the eviction of John Sykes, John
Wood, Richard Parry, Jessica
Ndad, June Winter and other
satisfactory tenants.

Women’s Letters
From Sydney
Most exciting news of the week is the
announcement that the King and Queen
and Princess Margaret will visit Australia
next year. This will be the first time a
reigning sovereign has come to Aus-
tralia, but the people here have happy
memories of the visit in 1927 of the King
and Queen, who were then the Duke and
Duchess of York. Most likely they will
come in H.M.S. Vanguard, the great
battleship in which they journeyed to
South Africa. This, together with the
British naval escort and the naval and
air escort provided by the R.A.N. and
R.A.A.F., should make the Royal entry
into Sydney Harbor a most spectacular
affair.
Canberra, of course, will be the scene
of most of the formal official functions,
and Yarralumla, where the Royal visitors
will stay as the guests of Governor-
General McKell, is to be spring-
cleaned from ceiling to cellar. There is
talk also of extensions to the house.. In
each State they will be the guests of the
State Governor and will stay at Govern-
ment House.
A series of glossy photographs show-
ing the glories of the Corinthic came into
the hands of this Letter last week. They
prove, once again, with the certainty of
a problem in Euclid, that there’s only one
way to travel, and that’s borne on the
ocean wave in a luxury liner. There’s
dignified spaciousness about the Corin-
thic’s lounge ; and the only thing lacking
about the smoking-room are some
sinuous dancing-girls and bubbling pipes.
There are verandah cafes and dining-
rooms, children’s play-rooms, and, as for
baths, they are scattered about like so
much confetti. In all, about 40 members
of the Old Vic. Company are touring
from England in this liner. They will
make a 20-week tour of Australia and
Maoriland, arranged by the British
Council. The three plays to be presented
during the tour are “Richard III” “The
School for Scandal” and a modern Ameri-
can comedy, “The Skin of Our Teeth,”
by Thornton Wilder —the lastnamed has
just finished a very successful London
season.
The engagement of Marion, youngest
daughter of the Bruce Priors and a grand-
daughter of The Bulletin’s S. H.
Prior, to Ted Arnott, only son of the
Frank Arnotts, forges another link in the
friendship that has existed over a number
of years between these two Bradley’s
Head-road, Mosman, families. Marion,
who had just left school when war broke
out, is still a V.A., as her detachment,
the Scottish remains on the active list. One
of her proud possessions is her Certificate
of Merit, signed by H.R.H. Duchess of
Gloucester, awarded for “outstanding
devotion to duty.” The young man served
with the anti-aircraft batteries and later
with the Cameronians in India and
Malaya under Lord Louis Mountbatten.

If your lucky star is in the ascendant,
and you keep your fingers crossed against
the Ides of March, you may still be
given a present of a Lewis Berger diary
for 1948. It’s the most charming thing
of its kind that has come this writer’s
way. It is Port Jackson between covers.
Each page is illustrated with an exquisite
drawing of rope and tackle, of the ships
big and small that sail on the waters
of the harbor, of the fish that swim in
them, and of the shells that the tide casts
up on the beaches that indent it. Each
month is introduced by a full-page pic-
ture against a bluey-green wash. For
January there is the quaint wedding-cake
light, while the four-masted barque Pamir
sails into December. But even more
fascinating are the small drawings of
rowboats and ship’s-bells, of pylons,
swimming ducks, old boatsheds and
lobsterpots. The drawings are by Hal
Missingham and Paul Beadle, the idea
of the book and the interesting foreword
by Roy Jenkyns. Printing and engravings
throughout are a delight.
Mrs. Jessica Lee, well known in Sydney
over a number of years as a philanthropic
worker, was recently married to S.
J. Baxter, of Milbang, Breadalbane. The
ceremony took place at the Church of
St. Nicholas, North Goulbum. The
matron of honor was Mrs. G. B. Stod-
dert. She is the only daughter of the
late H. H. Cripps-Clark, who, under the
name of “Two Seas,” for years delighted
readers of The Bulletin with his sea
yarns. Mrs. Baxter’s new home is about
five miles from her one-time-owned pro-
perty, Durralyma.

year they have been particularly active
in helping the War Widows’ Guild, and
have handed over to this group just on
£l4OO. This was disclosed at the auxili-
ary’s first annual meeting, which was held
at the Staff Corps Officers’ mess yester-
day. Plans are already in hand for a
garden party to be held at the barracks
on May 1, from which the Guild will

There was no talk of books or of the
making of them at the Women Writers
luncheon, when Mrs. Ada Holman, whose
Memoirs of a Premiers Wife is oneof
thq season s books, and Patrick Wmte,
w h° h as add e d stdl another , book (The
Aunt’s Story ) to his previous two suc-
cesses, wer;e the guests of honor. Patrick
was too shy to speak, but Mrs. Holman
told her listeners how easy it was to run a
house and have a career at the same time,
President, Mrs. Mary Irvine, introduced
the visitors, and Mrs. Gwen Spencer made
speech of thanks. Other speakers were
president of the Legislative Council, E.
l arrar ’ a life-long friend of the Holman
family, and Lady Anderson, who spoke
on Food for Britain,
Hats were a feature of the dressing at
this luncheon. They were small and be-
flowered, or depended for their effect on
their cartwheel size. Mrs. Scott-Waine’s,
rather like an inverted flower-basket, was
in natural straw, its upturned brim kept
in place with a bright ribbon. This hat
had been bought in England, as had her
black silk frock with its attractive draped
neckline. Una Kidgell, sister of Mrs.
Holman, and Mrs. Nell Strang, just
arrived by the Stratheden, were at the
luncheon. Marjorie Quinn, who is look-
ing much stronger, was greeted by all,
and recent arrival from England Tommy
Cochran had the opportunity of meeting
friends he had not seen for years, among
them Miss N. Jobson and Miss Wilson.
From Melbourne
The stage of St. Kilda Town Hall was
transformed into a hillside' scene with a
cascading waterfall, a softly - playing
fountain set among maple-trees, ferns and
hydrangeas for the Royal Melbourne
Hospital Centenary Ball, which was a
notable success. In the foyer were great
bowls of red dahlias, gladioli and white
shasta daisies. The ballroom tables were
decorated with floral red crosses and from
the balcony hung the flag of the hospital.
Accompanied by their personal staff,
which included Major G. Maxwell and
Capt. John Blood, the Governor, Sir
Winston Dugan and Lady Dugan were
received by the Chief Justice, Sir Edmund
Herring and Lady Herring.
, Lady Dugan wore a petal-pink chiffon
frock fashioned with a billowy skirt and
soft drapery over one shoulder ; the other
shoulder-strap was of pink and silver
crystal-bead embroidery. Her presenta-
tion bouquet of pale-pink-and-cream
gladioli blended perfectly with the gown.
Lady Herring, who was president of the
ball committee, wore a frock of fragile
black lace over taffetas. It featured an
off-the-shoulder bodice and the skirt was
highlighted with a bustle bow. In the
official party were the Lord Mayor,
knight Raymond Connelly and the Lady
Mayoress, Mrs. Bernard Heinze, whose
white satin bouffant gown was sprinkled
with diamente. Mrs. R. W. Chambers,
president of the hospital, wore a stunning
gown of white net covered with black
sequins. Mrs. Dennison Deasey, who
has just returned from England, chose a
midnight-blue chiffon gown, strapless and
with drapings over the hips. Mrs. Roy
Honeyman, to whose efforts much of the
success of the monster raffle was due,
wore a gown of pale lime-green crbpe
with gold ornaments. Mrs. Peter An-
drews was in shimmering pearl satin, the
bodice carrying gold trimming.
Iris Vincent Smith, one of the ticket-
secretaries, wore a bouffant frock of ice-
blue Swiss-embroidered organza over
silver lame ; her mother’s trained gown
was of black duchess satin. Hilda Corbett
effectively combined slate-blue satin and
cyclamen chiffon. Mrs. Sydney Baillieu
Myer wore amber-toned tulle with two
bands of black lace on the full skirt, the
bodice being of black lace. The folds
draped at the top of the bodice of Mrs. S,
Aarons’s pastel-blue slipper-satin frock
revealed her shoulders. Mrs. Richard
Faulkner’s velvet gown was grey-blue.
Mrs. Alan Tait wore a white Arctic-fox
cape with her white-and-silver lamd gown.
Ruth Tyrwhitt Drake wore a black satin
gown patterned with a series of diagonal
stripes in rich and glowing shades of
green, red and gold. Barbara Sellick’s
pastel-blue satin gown had a padded hip-
line and off-the-shoulder bodice. Mrs.
L. J. McConnan’s gown was of satin
printed with a Paisley design.
This portrait is of Joy, only
daughter of Mrs. E. Langford, South
Yarra, who has announced her engage-
ment to Frank, only son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edgar E. Greig, of Kew. Joy, who was
educated at the Presbyterian Ladies
College, is now secretary to the editor
of a leading Melbourne newspaper.
Swimming, riding, tennis and golf occupy
most of Joy’s spare time. Her fiance is
with his father’s engineering firm.
An all-white color scheme was chosen
by Maureen, elder daughter of Mrs. E.
Wilton, of Toorak, and the late Major
Eric A. Wilton, D. 5.0., when she was
married at St. Peter’s, Toorak, to Frank
Combermere, elder son of Mrs. F. Doyle,
of South Yarra, and the late Mr. Frank
Doyle. The Rev. Father E. Norris was
the celebrant, and Maureen was given
away by her brother, Lieut. lan Wilton.
The bride’s white chantilly-lace gown
was made over taffeta with the bouffant
skirt extending to a long train. The long-
sleeved bodice featured a heart-shaped
neckline, and the tulle veil was lent by
Mrs. Charles Godfrey. Attending the
bride, who carried a sheaf of Regal lilies,
were her sister Anne, Mary Malone, of
Sydney—who, incidentally, became en-
gaged at the reception to Harold Mighell,
of Melbourne —and Mrs. Clive Ormonde.
All three were dressed in bouffant frocks
of white organdie, and wore trails of
white tuberoses in their hair ; the flowers
were repeated in the bouquets they
carried. Val Gibbs was best man and
Eric Doyle, brother of the ’groom, and
lan Miller groomsmen.
The reception was held at 9 Darling-
street. Mrs. Wilton, who with Mrs.
Doyle received the guests, wore a black
crepe romaine jacket-suit and filmy
white lace blouse. Her small natural-
straw hat was trimmed with black velvet
ribbons. Mrs. Doyle chose a blue-and-
white patterned ensemble and a white-
straw hat ruched with black tulle. Guests
included Sir Frank and Lady Clarke and
Lady Knox, the latter in a beige en-
semble with large black hat and acces-
sories. Mrs. lan Miller’s floral frock was
worn with a black Merry Widow hat,
which had the largest brim yet seen in.
this city. With Dr. Douglas Stephens was
his wife, in floral frock and large-
brimmed white-straw hat laden with red
roses and lily of the valley. Mrs. Ot-
way Falkiner came from Widgewa, on
the Upper Murray, for the wedding.
Other guests included Maureen’s cousin
Jo Anne Wilton in an apple-green moire
ballerina frock and matching toque
trimmed with cyclamen roses; Mrs. J.
Lewis, in a simple black frock with an
osprey-trimmed hat; Hilda Corbett,
wearing white crepe and small white lace
straw hat; Mrs. Peter Lynch in navy
chiffon frock, short box coat of white
sharkskin trimmed with gold buttons and
small white, navy-trimmed hat.
Hats at the Newmarket meeting were
trimmed with feathers of every descrip-
tion—there were long pheasant-feathers,
colorful ostrich-feathers, the short, bushy
mount, and pert quills—there was even
one hat trimmed with the banned bird-
of-paradise plumes. Skirt-lengths are
longer, but one lass, wearing a bright
plaid skirt to her ankles, looked very odd.
The anklestrap-sandal type of shoe was
well in evidence and the platform soles
with gold studs still hold their own. Two-
toned shoes were worn with smart tailored
suits and walking shoes of suede were
of the lace-up variety. Pleated skirts
allied to the short jacket with its nipped-
in waist were noted in increasing numbers.
Lady Dugan wore a brick-red tweed
coat over her tobacco-brown frock; the
upswept brim of her matching red felt
hat was trimmed with brown corded
ribbon. Lady Leese, wife of Lieut.-
General Sir Oliver Leese, combined
cyclamen and blue in the herringbone-
pattern of her tweed coat; her small
cyclamen felt hat had tiny blue flowers
in front. Mrs. Richard Turnbull, wife
of the V.R.C. chairman, wore a tailored
coat of Spithead-blue facecloth and a
beige hat with rolled brim trimmed with
a long black quill.
The Duchess of Grafton, who has just
arrived from England, was smart in a
light-blue-and-white printed jacket suit
with a small white straw hat turned off
the face and trimmed at one side with a
knot of corded ribbon. Mrs. T. Holl-
way’s inky-blue wool coat was worn with
a spray of white gardenias ; her small
white hat was trimmed in blue. Mrs.
Gordon .Snow’s small plaid taffeta hat
was worn with a navy crepe romaine
frock. Helen Lewis had large gilt but-
tons trimming her black suit; her off-
white felt hat was finished with black
birds and a face-covering veil. Mrs.
Mary Hands’s cutaway suit was of navy
facecloth, the large buttons being gilt;
her French hat of pale-pink felt, upturned,
bore a wreath of navy ostrich-feathers.
Mrs. Edric Henty’s suit was navy, her
small white straw hat finished with navy
ribbons and veiling. Mrs. Norman
Martin’s off-the-face grey velvet hat was
trimmed with matching plumage. Her
daughter, Mrs. Alan Hutchinson, wore a
grey tailored suit. London-tan acces-
sories offset Mrs, Max Falkiner’s grey
suit.
Verdi’s “Rigoletto,” always a great
favorite despite the body in the bag,
brought a host of opera-lovers to the
Princess. Down from Olinda came
Madame Grace Angelau, accompanied by
her sons Guy and Jay. Violet Dunn was
in a formal gown of white cloque crepe,
with gold a fitting accompaniment. Mrs.
Garnet Carroll was resplendent in a white
Arctic fox cape-stole worn over a jacket
suit of royal-blue crepe embellished with
silver sequin embroideries. Mrs. Maurice
Sallmann wore platina foxes over her
black gown. Mrs. Paddy Moran, who
was with her medico husband, was in
white —she is a former musical-comedy
star. Mrs, J. E. Caiman wore royal-blue
draperies; Mrs. Eric Cottrell was in
formal black gown. Trixie Johnstone’s
short dinner-gown was of satin, glowingly
printed in flowers.

THE SERVICE MAN
PERCIVAL v. YAMASHITA.
Their Forces Compared.
“Ek Dum”: General Percival’s
dispatch on the Malayan cam-
paign is a lengthy, detailed,
soldierly document which puts
the campaign for the first time
into true perspective.
There was only one reason
for the Malayan campaign—to
defend Singapore fortress for as
long as possible in order to
prevent the Japanese from using
it as a base from which to
strike at British colonies and
Dominions farther afield until a
defence of them had been con-
trived.
This matter became doubly
urgqnt after the Americans lost
their Pacific Fleet temporarily
at Pearl Harbor. It was in some
measure achieved. For two and
a half months of the four needed
to make the Indian Ocean and
the seas round Australia safe
from invasion, through the injec-
tion into them of British and
American sea and air forces, the
Malayan campaign—amid ex-
ecrations of Communists and
their newspaper dupes—held up
the flower of the Japanese Army
and a large sea and air force.
It is pretty safe to say that if
it had not been for the time
taken over the Malayan retreat
Australia’s experience in the war
might have been a much harder
one. The fleet which was held
up off the Malayan Peninsula
Y/hile an ungrateful Australian
section screamed its ingratitude
might, instead, have been
anchored off Bunbury or even'in
Sydney Harbor. The Japanese
Imperial Guards might have
been fighting for Hunter’s Hill
instead of for Singapore Island.
General Percival writes;
The retreat from Mons and the re-
treat from Dunkirk have been hailed
as epics.... Each of the retreats lasted
approximately three weeks. The re-
treat in Malaya lasted ten weeks in
far more trying conditions. There
was no strong ally to help us and no
Navy to evacuate the force even if
it had been desirable to do so. It
has been hailed as a disaster, but
perhaps the judgment of history will
be that it was worth while The
gain of ten weeks and the losses in-
flicted on the enemy may well have
had a bigger influence* than was rea-
lised at the time on the failure of the
Japanese to reach even more im-
portant parts of the Empire.
Malaya was not, of course, fit
for defence. All effort during
the few months previous to the
invasion had been concentrated
on preventing Russia from going
under, as it nearly did. General
Percival goes further back into
the basic causes which he
assigns to “a common origin,
namely the lack of readiness of
our Empire for war,” though he
is courteous enough not to say
that a lot of this unpreparedness
was due to the activities of
persons who, only seven months
before the Japanese attacked,
were shrieking that the A.I.F.
must not be reinforced because
it was intended to use it in the
Middle East to attack the
U.S.S.R. through the Caucasus,
and because in Malaya it was part
of the machinery for enslaving
the free and enlightened Asiatic.
The Defence Problem
The features of the defence
problem were; firstly, that to de-
fend Singapore it was necessary
to have naval and air cover
which wasn’t there in adequate
strength. Secondly, since Aus-
tralia and India had virtually no
developed industrial war poten-
tial, it was necessary, primarily,
to depend on a base, itself under
fire from the air and involved in
a violent large-scale sea war
which it had by no means won,
round its coasts. This —the
United Kingdom base was 1
12,000 miles away by the prac-
ticable route.
Even in peace-time the defence
appreciation of Singapore pro-
vided an allowance of 70 days to
get a naval fleet from Ports-
mouth to the Malacca Straits.
In war-time this estimate could
be easily doubled.
On the other hand, the Jap-
anese had already well-estab-
lished bases 700 and 1700 miles
away. Their main bases were a
week’s steam over seas which
they completely controlled.
Finally, the Japanese were
able to use the very flower
of their troops, to give
Malaya the first call on
their supplies and to treat it
as a main objective, whereas in
the British Empire’s war the
United Kingdom (the only part
of the Empire with developed
war resources) had to give first
preference to its own shores,
second to the protection of the
world’s sea routes, third to
Russia, fourth to North Africa,
fifth to its great Dominions', the
rest taking what could be spared
and not always, the best. This
order was not dictated from
choice, but by a long-term
strategic plan for winning the
war.
Percival’s Appreciation
General Percival, coming late
into a field which had five com-
manders-in-chief during a couple
of months of his Malayan land
command, had been in Malaya
before as GSOI to General
Dobbie, later the dour and de-
vout defender of Malta. He
had made an appreciation of the
possibilities of Japanese method
as far back as 1937.
What took place, therefore, in
1941-42 was not novel to his
mind. Four years before he had
conceived, and officially re-
viewed, the chances of invasion
from Siam, the seizure of Kel-
antan and Penang, followed by
a drive down the peninsula
to attack Singapore from
the land side. This drive he
pictured as supplemented in
strength from the beaches of
1000 miles of coastline, which
were accessible on both sides
to an enemy with command of
sea and air.
He stressed, at that time, in
his report the need for strong
defences in northern Malaya
and Johore. He stressed,
also, the menace of fifth-
columns which would promote
strikes and disturbances apart
from doing the direct military
will of the enemy. He pro-
phesied the use of landing-craft
carriers, and of sea-tanks, which
eminent military critics later
earnestly believed to be the pro-
ducts of the vastly-superior
brains of the United States
Army and Navy—things which
the dull clods of Britons had
never thought of.
Forces Required
When he took over, therefore,
he was well equipped by know-
ledge and vision for his task.
He at once reviewed the position
and, on August 2, 1941, he sent
a cable setting out his target of
forces which it must be
strongly emphasised—was con-
structed on the presumption that
he would have powerful naval
cover and a minimum force in
the air of 336 modern machines
with trained pilots. His
requisition was for 48 infantry
battalions, four Indian recce,
units, nine field-artillery regi-
ments, four light ack-ack
regiments, two tank regiments,
three anti-tank regiments, two
mountain-artillery regiments and
12 field companies, with neces-
sary administrative units —this
taking no account of volunteers,
aerodrome ack-ack defence and
ack-ack defence of particular
localities, including the naval
base itself. Two heavy ack-ack
regiments were asked as an addi-
tion the following month, and
for Singapore alone he requisi-
tioned 212 heavy and 124 light
ack-ack guns.
The Dread Reality
Time showed how ambitious
this programme was. Against
the 336 efficient aircraft agreed
upon as a minimum requirement
—the real need was 566 —there
were 141, all obsolescent, so that
Buffaloes, Vildebeestes, Sharks,
battered Hudsons and Wirra-
ways had to fight Zeros, Junkers
88s and Junkers 878 dive-
bombers. There were no dive-
bombers in the British forces.
They had to face long-distance
craft with machines which had a
limit range of 300 miles. They
had to deal with an army which
had abundant modern transport
aircraft for the support of ad-
vancing and dispersed troops in
the jungle without any transport-
aircraft at all. They had to put
guns, few in number and re-
stricted in versatility, against an
enemy who had every variety
of weapon in abundance, am-
munition to burn and the means
to carry it. They had to pit
forces without anti-tank guns
worth the name against armor.
They had no tanks themselves
against 300 Japanese tanks.
The mechanical transport for
infantry was strictly limited.
And with all this and with the
disabilities caused by their isola-
tion, by the screaming panic of
the overseas press, news of which
must have been brought in by
reinforcements and the wireless,
they had to undertake their
lonely and arduous defence with
a force entirely inferior in man-
power and training to the pick
of the Japanese Army, which
was used against them.
Ours were not all first-class
soldiers:
Far too large a proportion of the
troops were only partially trained,
and there was a shortage 9f ex-
perienced leaders, especially in the
Indian and Australian units. Instead
of 48 battalions and supporting arms,
plus volunteers and aerodrome-de-
fence units, we had only 32 battalions
and supporting arms.
Practically all the Indian units
were suffering from the effects
of immense expansion of the
Indian Army which had begun a
year before and which had in-
volved the scattering of good
officers and n.c.os. very thinly.
It is easy to agree that the
supply of “leaders or even
of potential leaders” was “at
a dangerously low level.”
Few units had more than two
or three senior officers experi-
enced with Indian troops, and of
the juniors only a very small
proportion had had any Indian
experience. Most of the troops
were very young and inexperi-
enced. Some Indians had been
trained for desert warfare —the
worst kind of training for tropi-
cal rain-forest country. All of
them were in terrain in which
they were completely out of
their native element. And none
of them (A.I.F. included) had
had any really large-scale exer-
cises commensurate with the
tasks ahead.
Thin Dispersion
The dispersion of this entirely
inadequate force, of which the
A.I.F. was undoubtedly the best
large group, obviously had
to be very thin, seeing that it was
called upon to defend an area
as large as England without
Wales, not more than 60 miles
wide in places, though at the
widest 200 miles, a lot of it wild
swamp and jungle full of
malaria, with few crossroads and
as primitive as the Garden of
Eden. It had 1000 miles of coast-
line with many beaches on which
an enemy could land.
General Percival draws an
analogy:
It may be assumed that a superior
fleet is in occupation of Norway and
that Scotland is a neutral State, whose
territory must not be entered unless
the enemy is advancing with the obvi-
ous intention of landing in the south
of Scotland or has violated any part
of that country. In Cumberland,
Westmoreland and Lancashire there
is one division watching the main
road and railway approaches from
Scotland. On the East coast there
is a strong brigade group in Northum-
berland and a weak one at Hull
In the south there is one division
consisting of two brigade groups only
fi.e., A.I.F.]. One of these is on the
East coast about the mouth of the
Thames, while the other is in the
Oxford area. The Isle of Wight
(Singapore), where the Army H.Q. is
situated, is strongly defended on the
seaward side and has reasonably
strong ack-ack defences. The Com-
mand Reserve —one brigade group —
is partly in the island, partly in the
Cotswolds.
Viewed like that the defence
was of a staggering thinness even
if it had been called upon to
face a definitely limited enemy
force without knowing its strik-
ing-point or points and without
having the means of isolated
box operations. But it consisted
of inexperienced troops in the
main, as has been said, without
adequate air support or without
support at all.
Its artillery backing was even
more limited than its supply of
small-arms ammunition, which
was a worry from the begin-
ning.
The artillery complement with
which the 11th Indian Division
spread over the equivalent of
a block of country enclosed, say,
from Nowra (N.S.W.) to Can-
berra to Dubbo to Newcastle,
or Brisbane to Roma to the
outer Dawson to Maryborough,
holding at the same time a main
highway and railway against a
modernised and experienced
enemy of far superior force in
manpower, consisted of 16 4.5
howitzers, a mountain regiment
less one battery armed with a
mixed lot of weapons, an anti-
tank regiment with 36 two-
pounders, a light ack-ack bat-
tery with 16 Bofors and 24 25-
pounders. The recce, regiment
(Third Indian Cavalry) had
arrived without its armored
vehicles and had only recently
handed in its horses.
The Enemy’s Forces
The enemy, with command of
the sea —absolute in that area —
and with plenty of cargo-space
and light landing-craft suitable
for beach work, had a coastal
mobility which enhanced the
value of his forces greatly. The
Japanese had five, and prob-
ably six, divisions against the
three and a half of the
British forces at the begin-
ning of the' campaign, on
General Percival’s estimate. At
the fall of Singapore there were
about 85,000 British troops
on Singapore Island, perhaps
only 70,000 armed (the rest ad-
ministrative and medical), and
all these were short of ammuni-
tion for heavy operations. The
Japanese had over 100,000 in
Singapore and South Malaya at
the conclusion of hostilities, plus
300 tanks —with bombers, dive-
bombers and long - distance
fighters, about 530 altogether in
Thailand and Malaya and Indo-
China at the last phase of
Malayan hostilities when the
had almost none.
Whereas all the British
Dominion troops were relatively
untrained and all unblooded as
units before the campaign began,
the Japanese forces were the
flower of the Nipponese Army,
all specially and carefully
equipped and trained for the
work in hand. The enemy troops
included the Imperial Guards
and the Fifth Division, which
had been very highly trained in
jungle warfare. They had
been put through an exercise in
the Chinese War as far back
as April, 1941, when they
were landed on the Chinese coast
and used in a quick thrust in-
land which presented problems
very similar to those which they
might expect to undertake in
Malaya. Then they were sent
to Hainan Island, where they
were rigidly trained in jungle
technique and landing opera-
tions. When they came to
Malaya they had endless re-
sources behind them and first
priority for everything, yet their
campaign was only partly suc-
cessful.
The Japanese strategy was’ to
cut off the two Indian divisions
in the north by a swift drive,
reaching the Perak River in two
days. Had they done this Singa-
pore would have had short shrift
indeed. However, the half-
armed, ill-supported Indian divi-
sions held them back from the
Perak River line for 16 days,
and were not then cut off, thus
dislocating all the enemy’s plans.
Australia’s Peril
How perilous the whole posi-
tion was for Australia and yet
how little we contributed except
in advice and press objurgation!
Singapore was without doubt
Australia’s northern base, and
without doubt if Singapore had
fallen in December or early
January this country would have
been invaded, even if only
ephemerally. Yet all Australia
had in Singapore when war
broke out —though it had been
known for at least five months
thaf invasion of Malaya was al-
most a certainty—-were six Aus-
tralian battalions, two field regi-
ments, an anti-tank regiment of
light guns less a battery, two
field companies and a field-park
company, no ack-ack defence, a
few old Hudsons and some
pilots, a large number of whom
were little more than trainees.
If it had been left to us the
Japanese could have walked into
Singapore, and welcome. Then
the Indian Ocean would have
been theirs for the taking, Aus-
tralia would have been wide
open and the A.I.F. divisions in
the Middle East would have
been cut off.
Unforeseen Conditions
A factor was that Britain
could not have provided for
long-term defence adequately
except on assumptions of de-
velopments which seemed before
1940 unlikely. Very few critics
have paused to appreciate the
importance which Jap posses-
sion of French Indo-China
played in the attack on Singa-
pore. The possession of that
convenient attack-base only 400
miles away from north Malaya
shattered all strategic defence
plans'. But who in 1939 could
have conceived that the Japanese
would have secured that French
territory which brought them
within bombing range of Singa-
pore?
The Causes of Failure
When it was clear that
Indo-China would fall into
Jap hands the British com-
mand decided that the basis
of defence must be the air,
with a small military hold-
ing force which would merely
keep the fort until the air forces'
were in operation and immobi-
lised Jap sea communications.
Again unforeseen events —the
developments in the Balkans and
Greece, the entry of the Ger-
mans into the primarily African
zone of Africa, the strength of
German bombing attacks on
Britain, the huge development of
the submarine war, with a con-
sequent call for air-power, the
bringing into the war of Russia,
which had been our enemy until
June, 1941, and finally the loss
of U.S. aircraft which the Ameri-
cans left on their open aero-
dromes in the Philippines to be
shot-up —made the policy im-
possible. This left both land and
naval efforts in Malaya un-
covered from the sky and the
Japs with an enormous superi-
ority of men, machines, materiel
and opportunities.
The Final Factors
There were muddles and mis-
takes, as there are always where
a very inferior, ill-supplied force
is pitted against a superior one.
There was sometimes lack of
enterprise and determination, as
there always must be when un-
trained troops in unfamiliar
country are involved in a long
and fatiguing strategic retreat.
But they were shared alike by
all forces, and none is much in a
position to criticise the other.
In the end it must be remem-
bered that Singapore was' not
surrendered on military initia-
tive. On that little island of 225
square miles —from Manly to
Botany Bay, from Paramatta
to the Heads in Sydney terms—
there were 1,000,000 people
scarcely protected from bomb-
ing, with food running short,
sanitary arrangements dislocated
and perhaps 150,000 hotly-con-
tending troops shooting among
the defenceless civil population
if the fighting should continue.
The surrender came when the
water-supply was virtually gone
and when bombing threatened
a wholesale holocaust.
It is easy, remembering what
happened here when a Jap sub-
marine fired half a dozen lazy
shells into Sydney and when a
Jap recce, plane was rumored to
have flown over the city one
night, to imagine what would
have been the counsel on the
spot of those Sydney editors
who became almost apoplectic at
the thought that Singapore did
not “fight to the death.”
(An article describing the
fighting will appear next week.)

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Since Australia’s premier race is a
two-miler it’s surprising how few
other races there are here over that
distance. The V.R.C. has added to
the number the Carbine Stakes, a
standard w.f.a. event run for the
first time at Flemington on Wednes-
day last week. With prizemoney of
£2500 it’s the richest w.f.a. event
in Australia. At the weights, it was
a gift for Melbourne Cup runner-up
Fresh Boy, who, as a three-year-old,
carried Bst. to down Valcurl and
Black Law.
An advantage in the weights also
enabled South Australian two-year-
old Comic Court to turn the tables
on Scotwyn and Ungar in the six-
furlongs Ascot Vale Stakes. With
8.5 Comic Court received 71b. from
Scotwyn and JUOlb. from Ungar; they
finished in that order.
Starting hot favorite at 9 to 4
for the Australian Cup at Flemington
on Saturday, Sanctus managed to
run only a moderate third. Although
R. Cox, rider of Prince Chatham,
was later given a two-months’ sus-
pension for causing interference to
Sanctus three furlongs from home,
the favorite really had every chance
and was simply found wanting on
the day. A thrilling finish was fought
out between Adelaide Cup winner
Bannerette and Queensland Cup win-
ner Few Words; Bannerette took it
in the last stride.
Ridden, as she had been in past
successes, by Adelaide jockey D.
Graetz, Bannerette is a five-year-old
bay mare by Solar Bear-Bandrol. A
son of the St. Leger and Ascot Gold
Cup winner Solario, Solar Bear was
himself a well-performed stayer in
England, winner of the London Cup
(13f.) and the Stayers’ Handicap and
Queen’s Prize, both two-milers.
Adding to the string of successes
ootched up by South Australian reps,
over the V.R.C. meeting, Money
Moon made a stylish job of winning
the mile C. M. Lloyd Stakes from
a class field. Other runners were
Columnist, Chanak, Valcurl, Hororata
and St Fairy, who finished in that
order. Money Moon is certainly
doing everything right in his Don-
caster preparation.
One for the books was the Gibson
Carmichael Stakes (7f,), with Brovaxos
(R. Maddock) downing Carbon Copy,
Kerrigan and other two-year-olds.
Starting at 14 to 1, the winner was
the shortest priced of the three. Other
Flemington winners were St. Razzle
(W. Shipton) defeating Kindergold
and Galway Pipe over six furlongs;
Silver Rocks (W. Williamson) taking
the 10-furlongs Farewell Handicap
and John Masefield (W. Aldridge)
winning the Hurdle from go to whoa.
* * * *
The Flying, over seven furlongs, at
Rosehill on Saturday might have
given quite a substantial clue to tne
Doncaster-Sydney Cup double. Cer-
tainly as a spectacle it was a thriller.
Trover, whose success the books
would have greeted with joy, tried
to lead all the way and missed by
a whisker; Murray Stream, coming
on the outside, and Hiraji, bullocking
through in the centre after being
in trouble, both shaded the bolter,
a 151 b. pull in the weights giving
Murray Stream (J. Eaves) victory.
It was strange to see the finish of
a 1 sprint shared by a Melbourne Cup
winner and a dual Metropolitan
winner—a tribute to class and fitness
in both horses. Present intentions
are to start Murray Stream in the
Doncaster, Hiraji in the Cup, and
a lot worse doubles could be taken.
However, to this page’s eye the
best Doncaster trial seen at Rosehill
was that of Titanic (A. Ward), who
gave the Flying a miss to contest
instead the nine-furlongs Welter.
Lumping 9.4, Titanic finished brilli-
antly to beat Indarra and Torment,
both in receipt of a swag of weight.
It was a sterling performance for
a horse who’s in the Doncaster with
only 7.12 and has already proved
himself over the Randwick mile by
taking an Epsom.
Appreciating a more suitable dis-
tance than the sprints he’s been
contesting recently, the Beau Vite
gelding Paktong (G. Moore) won
the 12-furlongs Rosehill Cup, beating
Casanova, Royal Lad and other
moderates. In Mixed Stakes events
the best winner seen was Denali,
taking a seven-furlongs affair by
eight lengths and in better time than
Murray Stream’s in the Flying.
A similar event was won by Re-
spond (F. Williams) and an 11-
furlongs Mixed went to Parrakoola
(A. Mulley). Whistling Wind (W.
Briscoe) downed a tribe of two-year-
old fillies over six furlongs, and
Royal Andrew (G. Moore) accounted
for a bunch of their brethren.

There’s at least one course in the
world where the old axiom of horses
for courses doesn’t hold good—the
Aintree course, where they run the
English Grand National. A very
high proportion of National winners
have succeeded at their first attempt
on that gruelling run. An English
racing scribe writes; “Lack of ex-
perience on the Aintree course is
apparently more in favor of a runner
than against him.”

Royal Gem’s victory in the New-
market should finally dispose of
the lingering notion that it’s a
grievous disadvantage for a horse
to be drawn on the outside
in Flemington “straight-six” events.
The notion springs from the fact that
certain breakwinds once did give
“If you Want a really big’un I've got some TNT."
horses on the inside an advantage;
but that has long since been attended
to, and anyone who has walked over
it knows that the track on the out-
side is as perfect as it is on “the
rails.” But nothing is so hard to
kill as a racing belief or superstition.

Melbourne Jockey J. Crilley died

The Australian Olympic Federation
has named a team of 34 definite
starters for the Games. Heading the
list, and quite rightly, despise criti-
cism, is a girl West Australia s
Shirley Strickland. Of the whole
bunch, however, Treloar impresses as
most likely to rise to the occasion
when the pressure is on.
If there had been too much in-
sistence on time standards in making
the selections there would hardly have
been any British representation for the
recent Olympic speed-skating at St.
Moritz, there being such a wide gap
between British and Continental
times. The 1500-metres race on
skates was won by Farstad, of Nor-
way, in 2min. 17.6 sec. British rep.
Howes was only eighteenth in the
event, yet his time, 2min. 23sec.,
was a big improvement on the British
record of 2min. 27sec.

A sporting event that can reason-
ably be called historic —anyway, it
dates from 1445 —has been revived
this year at Olney (Eng.), having
been eclipsed by other events since
1938. It’s the Shrove Tuesday pan-
cake race, and in this year’s run
15 wives competed. As the “Times”
reported it: “The pancake bells of
the church gave the women warning
of the time to fry their pancakes
and of the time to assemble by the
pump in the market-square for the
start of the race. At the third bell
the competitors, frying-pans in hand,
start off along the quarter of a mile
route to the church. The rule is that
they must toss their pancakes twice
on the way and once as they run
down the path to the church door.
The winner is greeted .try the vicar
and kissed by the bellringer. In
a close finish the winner was
Mrs. Nellie Bosworth, of Neartown,
Olney.”

With Barnes (111), Harvey (104)
and Hasset (100) contributing their
respectable share, the Australian XI
closed at five for 538 against Tas-
mania at Hobart —the first step in
their trek to England. Tasmania
went west for 122 in their first in-
nings but saw time out for a draw
in the second, seven falling for 186.
A glance through the record-books
should help touring cricketers to
adjust their morale any time they’re
feeling down in the dumps, or, on
the other hand, too cocky. Bowlers
after a spell of fruitless laboring
against bats that look a yard wide
can seek solace in reading of Ward’s
none for 142 or Fleetwood-Smith’s
one for 298 in the same series. Or,
if they think they’re getting too good
for the game, they can have a crack
at Charlie Turner’s 1888 match record
of 17 wickets for 50 v. an English
XI at Hastings. Not much can be
done for the batsman doing a spell
of poultryfarming, but the over-
confident stonewaller can have a go
at bettering Stan McCabe’s time for
a double century—232 in 3hr. 55min.

“Ex-C.G.”: When I was a boy in
Victoria my old man took me
round the various gun clubs. My
hero was old Jack Sutherland,
who, under the gun-name of “Cal-
rossie,” always seemed to collect the
bacon. He came out of retirement
the other day, at 69, to walk off with
a galah-shoot at Kerang, downing 23
out of 25 birds, 19 on the first barrel,
against a record entry of 90 guns.

The Sydney match of Amurrican
importation Benny Evans against
Tommy Burns was about as poor
as fans could hope not to see.
Burns has never fought worse —that
on the word of a bloke who went to
school with him (his name then
Murphy) and reckoned he’d seen
Murph. turn on a better show at the
age of 10. Evans, in comparison,
looked fast and tricky, but obviously
didn’t have a powder-puff punch in
either dook; to make amends he led
in deadly fashion with his skull; six
rounds of butting were enough for
ref. Joe Wallis, who gave it to Burns
on a foul. All bets off. Some,
allegedly, are looking forward to a
return bout.
* * * *
At Leichhardt, Alfie (10.7), young-
est of the Trapping fraternity of
Sands, Sands, Sands, etc., lost over
12 rounds to ex-amateur champ.
Billy de Belin (10.61). Alf deserved
credit for constant hammering
aggressiveness, but he won only two
rounds (with straight lefts). De Belin,
punching cleanly and to purpose
throughout, won clearly enough for
even the unpredictable Leichhardt
crowd to approve the ref.’s decision.
Alfie having let the fraternity down,
brother Dave, visiting New Zealand,
retrieved the family name. Doug
Rollinson, as light-heavy champion of
those parts, should know something
about earthquakes; now added to
his knowledge are hazy recollections
of the one Dave loosed in the first
round.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Caltex”; The barber in our N.Q. .
town, who speaks crisply, somewhat on
the lines of a 8.8. C. announcer, settled
the Italian in the chair and reached for
the clippers, remarking perfunctorily
“Short at the back?” Cane-cutter Tony
was galvanised into action. “Shorta
tabac! I’ll-a say!” he exclaimed
vehemently. “You gotta some?” Snips
tells the yarn very dispiritedly. “That’s
the reward a man gets,” he says, “for
trying to keep the atmosphere of the tar-
boy and the longblow out of the barter-
ing profession!”

“H.E.R.”: “Hanko” and “Horseless
Horseman” (B. 25/2/’4B) are both mis-
informed. The native blackfish still in-
habits the northern rivers of Victoria.
Residents of Castlemaine fish for them
in Muckleford Creek, The northern
variety, however, is much smaller than
the southern, and as a fish big enough to
eat is big enough to breed, no minimum
length is fixed by the Fisheries and
Game Department. The northern kind
are often referred to as “slimies.”
“Waddlin’ Willie”: Murray cod, which
are normally only found in the Murray
and its tributaries, are being caught in
record numbers in the Yarra between
Templestowe and Worri Yallock on the
outskirts of Melbourne. As the Yarra
has no connection with the Murray and
its tributaries, the anglers put the ques-
tion to the State’s experts. Only evi-
dence produced in reply was the activities
of a group of pioneer anglers in 1871.
These men obtained large numbers of
small cod from the King Parrot Creek
near Wittlesea, placed them in water-
tanks, brought them over the hills and
liberated them in the Plenty and Yarra
rivers. They claim the fish now being
caught are descendants of those brought
over the ranges 77 years ago.
* * * *
“Harap”: Why do the ranks of cer-
tain avenues of trees lean toward each
other? The Greeks gave the trees sex,
and then made a love-story out of it. My
old Chinese friend Oi Lum Chong ex-
plained that each tree held a wicked
spirit—you could feel their presence if
you walked along the avenue in darkness
—and these spirits made the trees lean
inwards in an endeavor to pick lip odd
coins dropped by travellers along the
road. Awang bin ’Dullah, an erudite
Malay, agreed with the spirit-infestation,
but claimed that they were female spirits
and that the leaning was caused by a
desire of the females to exchange com-
ments on the physical charms of the
young gallants passing by. Actually, of
course, the explanation is simple. Two
lines of trees', planted fairly close to-
gether, give mutual shade which keeps
the inward-facing sides of the trunks
cooler than the outer sides. The sap,
rising more readily in the warmer part
of the trunk, stimulates upward growth
on the outer side. The inner side, lack-
ing sap, cannot keep pace with the outer,
and the natural result is an inward curva-
ture. If the avenue runs through a built-
up area the radiant heat from the build-
ings supplies the necessary stimulus to
the outside of the trunks'.

“Bon-Yi”: Consider this feat, per-
formed by three of the staff of the
Queensland Forestry Department at Yar-
raman in 1946, and be prepared to
wonder. Faced with serious risk of bush-
fires close to the hoop-pine plantations
and absence of water both for fire-fight-
ing and watering stock agisting among
the older plantations, the District
Forester in charge and his forest ranger
selected a site on the usually dry Rocky
Creek for an earthwall dam. Using an
R 4 tractor, scoop and terracer, and em-
ploying a driver for about six weeks at
a total cost of approximately £lOO, the
dam was built; it was 18ft. deep, 440yds.
long and averaged 80yds. across. The
torrential rains of last Christmas filled
it to verge of collapse, only a fortuitous
visit by the ranger on Christmas Eve
morning and a rush trip with nine men
to dig a wider bypass saving the wall
“Man overboard!”
from collapsing. It holds nearly
2,000,000ga15. now, is already the home
of various wildfowl, and hopes are held
for stocking it with perch and jewfish.
Willow cuttings will bind together the
wall which has now been widened to
30ft. at the top as a road into the plan-
tations.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: The quality of any
type of bush poultry depends not only
on its age but on its feeding ground.
The sweetest-tasting bird in the bush is
tough and stringy after subsisting for a
few months on the sparse feed of a
drought-stricken area. Ducks on the
salt lakes at Rottnest Island (W.A.) are
as tough and unpalatable as the mountain
duck. Teal, on the other hand, is good
eating. It nests out on the sandplains,
miles from water, presumably flying out
each day during the laying period ; and
within a day of hatching the ducklings
are disporting themselves in their natural
element.

“E.G.R.S.”: Just where is the line
drawn between the animal and vegetable
kingdoms? For years on each visit to
Woodgate (Q.) I saw dirty green objects
tide-abandoned on the beach, and was
told they were sea-cucumbers. The first
one I examined was 22in. of cucumber-
shape, the surface being patterned in pine-
apple-skin design. Beneath each bulge
of the design was a shell of an open spiral
type. In each of these absolutely uniform
shells (we estimated that the cucumber-
shape would hold 150) was a crab. I
concluded that sea-cucumbers were co-
operative blocks of flats run by crabs,
though how they reared their green sky-
scrapers and then inserted the individual
shells was mystifying. Then this year my
whole picture was upset. Idly picking
shells out of a fresh-looking specimen, I
noticed that as I descended from the top
end the shells became first very delicate
and transparent, then too fragile to handle.
Lower still they were mere embryos, and
at the bottom were several rows of trans-
parent bags of clear jelly and fluid —no
sign of germ or shape: absolutely veget-
able-like. And in the completed shells at
the top were not crabs but ordinary
tongue-shaped shellfish. The tribe ox
crabs in my first specimen, I presume,
must have been squatters.
* * * *
“P.J.H.”: I’ll bet “Midnight” (B.
28/l/’4B) that neither he nor his Chinese
fossicker can transplant gum-trees by that
fibrous-root-building process. It’s a loose
term which talks about transplanting
“native trees” as if they were all alike.
There are as many easily-moved trees
among natives (including kurrajongs) as
any others, and perhaps more finicky
ones that won’t move at all. I’ve listened to
all the “infallible” methods of transplant-
ing waratahs, N.S.W. Christmas-bush,
and so on, by various barbarian processes,
such as burning roots and lighting fires
over the old trunks. They all ignore
the reason for most failures in lifting a
plant from the bush —its feeding (or
fibrous) roots are spread far and wide in
search of moisture. Get the root-ball
full of fibre, as under good garden con-
ditions, and it will move all right. I’ve
tried moving hundreds of bush things and
had to get down to inch-high seedlings
with some so as to rake in all the roots.
* * * *
“Bo”: The bloke with the wall-eyed
dog had the floor. “You don’t call this
mud that you get on your boots in the
wet around these parts, do you?” he
said scornfully. “We’d think this stuff
was sand where I come from at Upper
Lansdowne. I was bogged once makin’
for Hannam Vale with a tabletop wagon.
It wasn’t half-way down to the axle, but
with that mud it was enough. A bloke
hitched his team of twenty-four bullocks
on to it. They was at it nearly all day.
In the end we had to wait till the mud
dried right out and then we quarried
the wagon out. I wondered when we
got it back home why it wouldn’t fit in
the wagon-shed. The boss got curious
an’ measured it, and found it had
stretched two foot eight! ”
* * * *
“Mat’s Mate”; We took a job with a
blocker in Mildura. He wasn’t a bad sort
and paid well, but after a few days he
began hanging about as we worked. We
gave him sundry oblique hints —such as
chucking shovelfuls of mud on his boots,
dropping posts within a whisker of his
h.ead, stamping “accidentally” on his toes,
etc., together with verbal indications —
that we preferred to work without a boss
overlooking us ; but he gave us a pathetic
look and kept on keeping near. Then he
took to coming to the hut at night and
hanging around us at the week-ends, and
Mat spoke up. “Well, I’m sorry, boys,”
our employer said wistfully. “Didn’t
mean t’ annoy you. Wasn’t tryin'
to spur y’ on or anythin’. Reckon
I was after a bit o’ company,
that’s all. Oh, well” —- He drifted
somewhat morosely away. Next day we
saw him working in another part of the
block, his wife beside him. “Y* know,”
Mat said, “The missus has never come
near us.” We pondered the fact deeply,
and Mat made it his business to seek the
boss out. We saw a good deal of him
after that. Yes, his missus considered
common working men beneath her notice ;
she nagged him from morning till night.
Work it out for yourself.

“Solitude”: We were bringing a mob
of cattle off the back run and, three
droving days out, had camped for the
night when the hikers straggled wearily
down the creek. Seventyfiver was still
taking in their small tent interestedly
when one of them strode over. “How
far off the township are we?” he in-
quired, “Two days if y’ can walk,” the
old bloke told him. “Three if y’ can’t.”
“Two days! Gosh! Thought we’d hit
the town tomorrow by short-cutting
across the range there. You see,” he
added, “we finished our eats tonight.”
Seventyfiver eyed him critically. “Y’
don’t ever want t’ come into this country
without y’r tucker, me lad,” he told him
severely. “Ain’t no game round ’ere.
Trouble is, we got held up ourselves an’
ain’t got nothin’ t’ spare im the grub
line.” The bloke nodded gloomily and
turned away. Next morning they were
gone. At midday I whistled the old fol-
lower, boiled the billy and was unrolling
the pack when Seventyfiver rode back
from the lead. “Hey,” I yelled, “where’s
the tucker?” “There’s a bit there,” he
answered. “Yair,* that’s it,” pointing to
a small half-slice of stale crust in my
hand. “Aw, well, Sol,” he defended apolo-
getically, “they were only young ’ns, an’
.. .an’ sorta helpless. Not a bit used t’
roughin’ it like we are.”

Jim O’Keeffe: Forget those theories
on the “bush” origin of the term “hatter”
for citizens of noticeable eccentricity. It
originated,.in England long before James
Cook sighted our eastern coast. The fur,
wood-shaVings and whatnot that went
into the toppers and beavers of the time
were treated by the hatters with certain
compounds of mercury ; many hatmakers
fell victim to mercuric poisoning, which
had a disastrous effect on the sufferers’
sanity. An alarming number of hatters
went mad until investigators nailed the
cause, and the processes involving the us.e
of mercury were outlawed. Apropos, the
practice of making hats of standard sizes
is fairly modern. Hats used to be chosen
without any particular regard for size,
and adjusted to fit the wearer’s head with
a running cord reefed through a series
of holes in, or loops on, the inner band,
and tied at the back. The natty little
silken bow that lends tone to the rear of
the sweatband of a modern masculine
tile is a relic of the cord.

“Fang”: As one who’d preserve the
Murray River from tourist hordes, if that
were possible, I’d prefer “The 0.D.” to
draw a veil over “Narrin’s” snake-shoot-
ing fame. What if the sport c.aught on
in popularity, attracting overseas game-
hunters? Sahibs used to shooting tigers
from the backs of pigrooting elephants
would come flocking to the scene for
snapshooting tiger-snakes as frail canoes
bucked through swirling rapids. It
wouldn’t be long before a cove had to
have a licence, and there’d be bag limits
and close season. Dammit, he’d even
have to be careful not to forget him-
self and massage a stray Blake with a
sapling and find himself up before the
local Beak for killing protected game.

“D.R.H.”; A mile from Bill’s place the
track passes a huge rabbit-warren and its
suburbs. The white clay-flats all about
are naked to the sun, but there is some
buckbush and a few small shrubs in the
little watercourse channels nearby. The
day was hot, the glare was blinding, and
from the tiny patches of dead-black shade
round the buckbush and under the creek
banks scores of rabbits hopped listlessly
away, high-backed and hollow-bellied, as
I passed. Each patch of shadow was
literally packed with bunnies,' and was
repacked as soon as I was 100 yards up
the track. I went on, marvelling at the
intelligence that makes bunny leave the
dim coolness of his burrow in hot
weather. It must have been many
degrees cooler down below, but the air
would be dead and the humidity much
higher. But how could a rabbit know
that the parched and quivering air above
I ground was a much healthier environment
than the darkness down under the
ground? I was still wondering when I
reached Bill’s place. We went inside, and
I had to stand still for a minute or so
until my eyes grew accustomed to the
gloom. Bill’s missus had set up her de-
fences against the heat: all doors and
windows were shut tight, all blinds
were drawn and the cement floors of the
back rooms had been thoroughly
sprinkled with water. The darkness was
a precious thing after the glare outside,
but the air was dead and the humidity
perceptible. “Good sort of a rabbit-
burrow you’ve got,” I said to Bill.

“Zake”: Struck ap old chap at dusk
on the river-bank baiting up. Each of
his three old cuttyhunk lines were
attached to steel serrated-edged rat-traps,
his bait being pieces of rabbit that were
rather “high.” After lowering the traps
carefully into the water he put the round
corks on to which the ends of the line
were tied in a kerosene-tin, alongside
which he dossed. His contention was
that cod, even when not hungry, were
curious and that at least one per night
could be induced to poke its bib into
one of the traps. Any of the Qouncil
tried this lazy plan’s idea of angling?,
JOCK’S HILL.
When Jock the shepherd long ago his sheep
on Yangar grazed , , , , . ,
The forest range that walled them back by
tracks had not been blazed;
When down the slopes no farther came the
timber tall and dense ,
The plain rolled out and on and on, a lano
without a fence.
Jock’s hut of slabs and bark stood' on the
last hill’s slanting side,
The furthest outpost of the run when station
runs were wide; ■ ,
The waters of Port Phillip spread low down
and far away . ;f
And now and then Jock saw white sails dntt
on across the Bay.
No city on the shoreline then with distant spires
Or chimneys tall with belching smoke to blur
the sky’s clear blue;
No fevered crowds had crossed the plain, out
west or northward bound
It was the shepherd men, they say, who hrst
the rich gold found.
Long lonely days the shepherd spent, the nights
more lonely still ... , .
When he had rounded up his sheep and camped
them on the hill . ,
And in the hut the slush-lamp threw weird
shadows on the bark
And through the cracks between the slabs shone
out into the dark.
When fences hemmed the station in the shep-
herd’s day was done
And horsemen rode the boundaries around the
Yangar run; , ,
Jock’s empty hut, a tumbled wreck, was by
a bushfire burned;
A grass-grown trench, scarce noticed now, shows
where the sods were turned.
Jock’s Hill his resting-place was called, and
through the years of change
Jock’s Hill it is to farming folk who live
beside the range;
There’s no one knows which way he went or
to what end he came — .....
He left a scar upon the slope, the hill hjs
kept his name.

JOHN G. GILBY.


“Betcha”: Frank had left it a bit late
to buy the handful of rams he wanted for
his small place, and the only available
offering was some better-class animals at
25 guineas. “But, cripes, five- or six-
quid rams is good enough,” he
“What y’ reckon a bloke oughter do?”
“Well, I dunno,” Charlie advised him.
“Think I’d take ’em if I were you. You
wqn’t get others now, and with better
lambs you’re sure to make up the differ-
ence in price later.” Frank nodded
thoughtfully, and, after considerable dis-
cussion and figuring, he bought the 25-
guinea anjmals. Turning them on to the
good feed of the house-paddock, he
branded them, dosed them and for the
next few days watched them carefully.
At the end of the week Charlie met him,
heavy-eyed and weary, dragging himself
up the paddock with a load of salt-lick.
“Cripes, y’ look worn out!” Charlie
remarked, eyeing him. “What’s the
trouble?” “Aw, it’s them rams,” their
new owner explained. “I can’t flamin’
well sleep at night for thinkin’ that
twenty-five guineas’-worth might turn up
its toes!”
* * * *
“Eastern”: Cockie Rodgers
straightened his back to survey the acres
of fern yet uncut and addressed old
Darkie: “Better call it a day, old boy.”
He strode up the flat to where a hand
was erecting a crooked, line of fence.
“Couple of hours late startin’ this
mornin’, weren’t y’. Bob?” he asked. The
fencer shrugged. “Might ’a bin a bit
late,” he agreed, “buCnear enough. Won’t
be here t’morrer. Hear the beer’s goin’
to be on in town. It’ll give y’ a chance
t’ split some more posts an’ put on the
line so I c’n do a bit next week.” “Yair,”
Cockie sighed. “Awright, Bob, I suppose
I c’n wait.” Half an hour later Cockie
met the mailman. “Hear prices were
down at the last sale,” the mail-carrier
informed. “They were, eh?” Cockie
chuckled heartily. “It’ll come, Ben.
They’ll drop t’ blazes an’ things’ll come
back, you’ll see.” The mailman stared.
“Yes, but you wouldn’t be making any-
thing,” he pointed out. “If there’s a de-
pression blokes’ll be out o’ work every-
where, and” “Too right they will!”
roared Cockie. “An I’m waitin,’ Ben,
waitin’ for ’em to come walkin’ up that
track there an’ sayin’ ‘Mr. Rodgers, will
y’ please give us a job?’ ”

“Pedant”: Steinbeck imagined nothing
new when he drew the picture of
an old man, just about at his last, drawing
a little sustenance from what Mr,
Micawber described as “Nature’s font.”
What schoolkid hasn’t heard of Jugurtha,
dethroned king of Numidia, N. Africa,
106 b.c., placed by the Romans in a
prison cell to starve to death, yet who sur-
vived because his daughter, permitted
to visit him frequently, fed him from her
breast on Nature’s own specialised food.
In China, too, for thousands of years
robust nursing mothers made a little in-
come on the side by nourishing invalids
and the aged.

“Moyhu”: In 1945 the King River
(n.-e. Vic.), which in living memory had
never previously ceased to flow, dried
out with the exception of a few water-
holes which were soon to become the
meeting place of cormorants, water-rats
and farm boys with rakes and wire-
netting scoops. As the drought, the worst
in the State’s history, progressed, even
these lost the last sign of moisture. Then,
with rain still months away, a cry was
heard: “The river’s coming down! ” And
it was. Sweet and clear, robust enough
in flow to withstand the pull of the
sandy riverbed, it refilled holes, renewed
acquaintance with logs, stones and banks,
moving down from farm to farm, pleas-
ing yet puzzling all. Where did the water
come from? Rain and melting snow,
seemingly the only two sources, could be
ruled out —yet here it was, gurgling and
wholesome, reviving drooping gardens
and spirits. Old hands attributed it to
"No wonder you cant raise anyone, Harry — here's a loose connection
mountain springs which, they claim,
always flow stronger in times of drought.
If true, it’s a compensatory phenomenon
on as par with soil benefits derived from
a long droughty spell, or parasite-control
effected by a succession of severe winter
frosts.

“Gravelsnatcher”; Does any man
know yet what colors will be encountered
half a mile below the ocean surface (B.
11/2/’48)? Beebe found that, as he
descended, the colors gradually faded, be-
ginning at the red end of the spectrum,
leaving a blackness which deepened until
the term black lost its meaning. Yet even
then Beebe saw brilliantly-colored fish,
even one, like a crayfish, which “ex-
ploded” in a flash that seemed designed
to dazzle an enemy even as it propelled
itself away—the deep-water equivalent of
the sepia jet with which a squid darkens
the water. Which suggests that the
absence of light is not complete at half
a mile. Perhaps it isn’t anywhere.

“Esk D.”: No landscapist could do
full justice to the setting of Courtland’s
place, a rich scene of undulating pastures,
well-bred stock, fine house and fruitful
orchards and gardens, flanked by steeply-
rising blue ranges and fronting a willow-
fringed stream. Yes, old Jim slaved all
his days to carve that model farm from
the scrub and timber, and still does his
share with his eldest son, Tom, and young
Harry, who has a perpetual grievance
against farm life. For the third time
in the week Harry backs the coupe from
the shed and speeds down the dusty road,
this time to a race-meeting at a small
town 50 miles away. His father watches
him go with troubled eyes. Dust and
sweltering heat prevail at the. races. While
the mood presses him Harry joins in
wholeheartedly with the animated throng
“If he gets your boy-friend can I take you to the pictures tonight P”
surging from the bar to the bookies and
back, swallowing lukewarm beer and
feverishly making bets. But it grows
stale after a time, and Harry gets fed-up
and heads for home. Over the tea-taole
he is aware of the reproachful glances ot
his ageing parents. “Whyever don’t y
settle down, Harry?” his mother asks.
“If Dad had been as shiftless we’d never
have had a farm like this. You should
follow his example and keep it a credit
to us now the bullocking’s been done.”
“Oh, hang it all,” Harry breaks out.
“Dad had somethin’ to work for, pioneer-
ing bushland an’ making his way. All I
got is the damn’ routine of farming the
place.” Jim, wise old bird, bought an-
other block of virgin scrub and gave
Harry a start. He looks like making 'out
even better than his old man.

“Dronestung”: The affinity between
bees and plants is almost uncanny in its
working, the nectaries of blossoms dis-
tilling steadily to provide encouragement
for the insects to probe at frequent inter-
vals, Or it may be pollen that is offer-
ing, and in both cases the interchange of
minute particles of pollen means fertilisa-
tion and, the ultimate in the life cycle,
reproduction, • A pis co-operates valiantly,
each trip by worker-bees confined rigidly
to one kind of plant, so that there’s
nothing haphazard in producing general
fertility. Colors may attract bees, but it’s
the honey scents that tip the scale, and
flowers of the same kind in various shades
are worked impartially. But it must be
a stage in evolution or something that
provides plants such as certain wattles
with false nectaries that keep bees occu-
pied industrially at times, for it’s another
season when the pollen-bearing flower-
heads are ripe for fertilising.

“X.E.D.”: Sam’s yarn; “I’m camped
in the city once —nothin a tent like this,
o’ course, but a room in a flash pub. It
wasn’t that I c’d afford it there —I couldn’t
find room in a cheaper place. Well, it
skinned out me roll payin’ in advance
f’r a fortnight, an’ I on’y had a few bob
left t’ buy tucker. Payin’ f’r meals was
out o’ the question. Lucky I had me spirit-
stove with me, so I cooked in the room,
though because of complaints I had t’ have
meals at odd hours. I cobbered up with
a bloke who fished orf the pier every day,
an’ he useter give me some of his catch.
There was a rare sort o’ argyment one
evenin’ a snooty-lookin’ joker objected
t’ me cleanin’ fish in the bathroom, but
I’d paid f’r me room an’ privileges and
wasn’t goin’ t’ be slung out. Then I
struck a couple o’ coves from the country
who weren’t able t’ git accommodation,
so I fixed it with them t’ sleep on the
floor in me room an’ charged ’em a few
bob so’s I c’d buy me meals. A couple
o’ days later the manager, a couple o’
flunkeys an’ a John tossed me an’ them
out. Reckoned I was breakin’ the law
by takin’ in boarders an’ was lucky t’
dodge bein’ run in. But it shows y’ how
hard it is t’ git a decent go in the city
an’ why the better-class blokes like me-
self stick t’ the bush an’ its ways.”
* * * *
“Old-timer”: Murmurin’ Mick, whose
beat was up and down the track from
Moama to Moulamien and Balranald,
saw them begin the building of the
Moama-Balranald railway and heard
great talk about closer settlement, new
towns springing up and so forth, and
was mightily put out about it. “Can’t
stand crowds,” he murmured. “Reckon
I’ll head off out west somewhere.” The
line was finished and Mick hung around,
visibly beginning to cheer up as the
months and then the years went by vtfth-
out much settlement and no new towns.
He kept to his beat, but gradually
changed to humping the knot along the
line, which he found far less risky than
the road— it had become infested with
motor-cars tearing back and forth in
clouds of dust. “It’s a hard dog for a
old road,” Mick murmured, in the bar
of the Border Inn, “an’ I can get along
them sleepers easy now. In the old days
a man could get a lift on a buggy or
wagon, if he wanted it, but these here
motors haven’t time to stop for y’. If
they do the blokes expect y’ to tell ’em
dirty yarns or somethin’. On the line a
man can climb into a truck at Wamboota,
go t’ sleep an’ wake up in Balranald.’’
“What’Jl y’ do when everybody’s flyin’?”
asked somebody. “Won’t be no trains
or cars then.” Mick thoughtfully eyed
his empty pot till his questioner nodded
to Bung. “Oh, well,” he murmured, “I
reckon I’ll be flyin’ around meself be
then. It’s a hard dog for a old road.”
He grounded his empty pot and headed
for the kitchen to fill his nosebag.
* # * *
“Gip”: After contemplating a fruit-
tree suffering from an onslaught of pos-
sums I’m still wondering how the little
grey chaps manage such a thorough job.
Not only the fruit crop, but every leaf,
too, had been eaten. One can under-
stand them collecting the lower leaves in
a face, but how about those topmost
shoots? For several feet those thin new
growths would not hold the weight of a
possum, nor were there any stronger
branches near from which they could
reach out. Undoubtedly the shoots
would bend, but if drawn down hand-
over-hand would never stand the com-
plete-circle bend necessary without
snapping. Climbing as high as they
could, did the little acrobats lasso the
further spikes with their tails, or did they
work in collusion, each bending his own
branch across to his neighbor?
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: While I can’t altogether
endorse the view that lack of recognition
would be the sole reason for a dog ? s
strange behavior if he saw his master
dressed in feminine attire (B. 25/2/’4B),
I agree that animals are influenced by
appearance. For instance, every week-
day morning my overgrown platelicker
greets my first appearance with the most
casual of tail-wags. But what a differ-
ence on Sunday mornings! If his excited
barkings don’t secure a prompt undoing
of the chain and subsequent romp, his
protests rise higher than the cost of build-
ing. The dog’s I.Q. being what it is, I
was certain that he didn’t count the days
or read the calendar, but a logical ex-
planation for the regular Sunday per-
formance baffled me. Then one Sabbath
morn, not feeling up to the usual “clean
up the horseyard” routine, I appeared
after breakfast in pyjamas instead of the
tattered old Sunday morning shorts.
Ziff merely looked up lazily, wagged a
couple of bars with his tail—from the
prone —and went to sleep again.
* * * *
“Flathead” on being lazy:
Tethered near a docile bombora a hundred
yards offshore, we had passed the morning
without getting a bite; lunch put the finishing
touches on the drowsiness the sun had wrought
among us, and one by one we slid down on
to the boards, each with his wrist rested on
the gun’l, unconcerned whether his line tugged
or didn’t. Then we scrambled up to look
at whatever it was that had swum past with
hefty splashes and bellowed to another pf its
kind; “Come on, Charlie, the tide’s just right. ’
Our eyes were focussing again and we were
able to get a good look at the second being
who, like his cobber, wore rubber flippers on
his feet, had a circle of glass set in a mask
over his eyes and nose, and dragged a spear
attached to a cord fastened around his middle.
We watched them scramble up on to the rocks,
adjust their headgear and, after a breather,
dive into the breakers. Nearly a mmute and
they rose again, each with a pound or so of
living silver twisting on his spear. They had
a conference, and the one called Charlie, bearing
both fish, swam over to us and asked it they
could leave their catch in the boat until they
were going back: “The fish might get washed
off the rocks.” We drowsed again, stirring
now and then as another fish thudded into the
divers’ haul up in the bow. Later, when they d
picked them up, threaded the three dozen on
a cord and left us still unsuccessfully riding
the swell and eyeing our empty bag, with at
least one contemplating a dive over the siqp,
our skipper, Harry Jubb, spoke words of wis-
dom: “That wasn’t fishing they were doing.
They’ve lost the point. The real pleasure in it
comes when you have learned the art of being
completely lazy, without a worry in the world,
just sitting and waiting. You dont have to do
the Mohammed act—they 11 come to you. And
when they did—a run of 41b. mpwong that
loved our prawns—we all agreed with him.
COW.
Yes, I have known the sloppy bail,
The dreary grind in mud and slush,
Cursed you from horns to tip of tail;
But, cow, I’ve seen you oft in lush
Green paddocks, where the grass was deep
And rich and sweet, like smell of hay;
When shafts of purest gold would keep
You company all through the day;
Seen you at early morning’s rise
When fog and earth were closely spun,
And y<ju stood faint against the skies,
Your outline lit by early sun
That streamed its palest morning light
And shadows made of powdered blue
Wherein, among the dewdrops bright,
I saw the shadow-shape of you;
Seen you wind past at end of day
When evening mists began to rise,
The earth fade slowly dnto grey
And you grow dim before the eyes;
Heard you press softly up the hill
And heard the low, deep, vibrant knell
Within the darkness soft and still
Of your old mellow copper bell.
I see a perfect morning scene
Where, oh, so often I have found
You standing still in peace serene
Where frosted cobwebs starred the ground
As if great Gruner’s priest-like hand,
There in that early silver hush,
Had, with his masterly command,
Arranged your beauty for his brush.
VICTORJA.

"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Sheep-fly.
“K.W.R.”: C.S.i.R. observa-
tions on a Stanthorpe (Q.)
property are continuing, and the
association between so-called
fleece-rot and body-strike has
been confirmed. Last year
about 1 p.c. of strikes occurred
among sheep showing no fleece-
rot, compared with about 22 p.c.
among those showing severe
fleece-rot.
Sheep affected by fleece-rot in
1946 again showed tendencies to
the weakness in 1947, while
fleece-rot was found to be more
prevalent among sheep classified
visually as “dense-woolled” than
among those with very slack
fleeces. This was observed also
among sheep at the McMaster
Field Station, and is recorded
because it is contrary to the
general belief.
Further investigations to de-
termine the quantity of dressing
required have followed the
C.S.I.R.’s discovery that a dres-
sing of boric acid, citronella and
bentonite was highly effective in
preventing strikes of lamb-mark-
ing wounds. As a result, it may
now be stated that generally the
number of lambs dressed should
not exceed 100 per gallon. If
flies are relatively inactive the
dressing may be effective when
used more sparingly.
The efficacy of the dressing
almost certainly is due to the re-
pellent effect of the citronella-
oil content, and in subsequent
trials using the boric acid-
citronella-bentonite dressing as a
standard, similar protection was
given by spraying with pure
citronella oil, semi - natural
citronella oil ( i.e ., citronella oil
from which most of the geraniol
had been removed), or dibutyl
phthallate. The quantity used
was about 2.5 ml. per lamb.
, Flies were not particularly
active during the tests, which
must be repeated and extended
to include other repellents, but
if present conclusions are con-
firmed citronella oil would be a
highly economical dressing.
The Dry Cow.
“Mr.” : A cow ends her milk-
ing season in a lean, rangy con-
dition as a rule and is often put
out in a back paddock on a diet
barely sufficient for subsistence.
She’s not producing and conse-
quently doesn’t need to be fed
as well as the milkers—that’s the
usual argument. It’s as fal-
lacious as it’s stupid, as any
good herd manager will say.
A dry cow needs feeding.
There’s tissue loss and bodily
exhaustion resulting from the
long milking season to make
good, and, more important,
there’s a need to build up re-
serves for the next lactation. In
a paddock that can offer only
dry, unpalatable fare, the cow
can’t help but calve in low con-
dition. Any feed given after
calving will be absorbed mainly
in keeping up the milk supply.
Bodily condition, already low,
will remain unaltered, or even
deteriorate, with a bad effect on
production. Given additional
feed during her dry period in
the form of silage, hay or good
chaff she’ll look, calve and milk
better and pay back with interest
money spent on the extra feed.
Rigging an Engine.
“R.H.G.”: When rigging-up a
car engine as a stationary plant
(B. 11/2/’4B) better results can
be obtained by including the
full rig of clutch and gearbox,
“It's amazing what weeds this rain brings up!”
with levers. A shortened uni-
versal shaft (universal at both
ends) should be attached behind
the gearbox in the ordinary
manner. The far - end uni.
should be welded to a plain
shaft by any handy means —I
found that a main-drive pinion
fitted the open end left, and this
could be welded on to the plain
shaft, which itself is laid in two
ball-bearing plummer blocks set
on rigid pedestals. Between the
two ball-bearings is fitted the
main-drive pulley.
The engine can then be set up
in a wooden frame of 4in. x 2in.
timber, roughly lined up with
the plain shaft, adjusted for
distance and the universal shaft
slipped into place. End-play is
negligible and harmless, and is
held in check by the gearbox
bearings and the collar inside the
ballrace housing at the far end.
By this means perfect torque
drive is ensured—no side-pull
on gearbox bearings, easy load-
free starting, no free pulleys,
choice of gears for different
speeds and loads* and quick
safety chuck-out with the clutch-
lever. Throttle can be adapted
for particular usage or a gover-
nor fitted. I find that extended
throttle control is more eco-
nomical and gives more power
when wanted, as it has much
greater range than any governor.
Cooling should be carefully
watched, and for day-long run-
ning for a 20-30-h.p. engine with
water pumps 200 to 300 gallons
of water are necessary, Solvac
B should be added to the water
—about a quart or more per
50 gallons—to eliminate scale
and consequent blockages. My
V 8 Mercury plant, rigged like
this, runs a small sawmill with
surprising economy.

Passion Vines.
“Plane Creek”: Paying crops
of passionfruit cannot be grown
unless the vines are carefully
tended. Neglected vines soon
*
become worthless and a source
of danger to other plantations.
Passions require well-drained
ground, but unless they can be
watered they are likely to suc-
cumb to heat during a severe
.Summer. Even though the vines
hang on through drought the
crop will be lost. Therefore it
is useless planting passion vines
unless they can be watered
while the fruit is developing.
If the main runners are
trained along and kept securely
fastened to their wires from, the
start future pruning will be
simplified. A good cutting-back
every year is essential. They
should be pruned in late winter
(say August) when a large sum-
mer crop is desired, in the late
spring or early summer for a
winter crop. They should be
well watered after pruning.
Spray the pruned vines with
4-4-40 Bordeaux mixture, repeat-
ing at monthly intervals for six
months, whereupon a spraying
every two months will suffice
until it is time to prune again.
This treatment will do much to
prevent brown-spot and scab,
the two major passion diseases
in Queensland and N.S.W.
Woodiness, very common in
passion vines, shows itself in
distorted foliage and malformed
fruit. As it is caused by a virus
circulating in the sap of the
vine, it cannot be treated. All
affected vines should be cut
down with as little disturbance
as possible (since that might
spread the virus to neighboring
healthy vines) and destroyed.
Fruit-tree Health.
“M. I. Tchell”; That cry (B.
18/2/’4B) that backyard or-
chardists in N.S.W. allow their
fruit to become “riddled with
disease,” thus infecting com-
mercial fruit, reminds me that
the late Sir Albert Howard, agri-
cultural scientist, said that
disease is Nature’s method of
telling us that we are poor hus-
bandmen and the soil is sick. In
other words, a healthy soil is
disease-resistant. In An Agri-
cultural Testament he gives ex-
amples of his own experiments
during his working life and after
his retirement, wherein he found
himself the owner of an old
apple orchard heavily infested
with codlin-moth. This he
treated by adding compost
(made by the Indore
method invented by
himself) to the soil,
and in three years
the trees were re-
juvenated and al-
most disease - free.
No artificial ferti-
lisers were used —he
says they kill earth-
worms and other
valuable subter-
ranean soil-tillers —
no poison sprays and
no diseased wood
was burned. Fm trying it on my
few trees this year.
Keep Fowls Cool.
“J.J.A.”: Fowls are liable to
suffer in hot weather. Birds
that have become unconscious,
or nearly so, can be revived by
splashing cold water over their
heads. However, it is far better
not to allow them to become
overheated. Take a spray-pump
and spray water against the
underside of the roof. This
breaks up into fine drops and
evaporates, cooling the air. The
drops that fall on to' the litter
will damp it without wetting.
This method gives far better re-
sults than just dashing water on
the litter. The walls can also be
sprayed. The hens may be ner-
vous at first, but after a day or
two they get used to it. If you
have no spray-pump the water
can be dashed against the roof
with a bucket, but this is not
quite as effective.
The Mistletoe Pest.
“E. V. S.”: Queensland
forestry officials are alarmed at
the wide range of infestation and
damage to native timbers. From
coastal belts the pest has ex-
tended to such widely-separated
areas as Bourke, Dubbo,
Goondiwindi, the Mitchell dis-
tricts and the State forest re-
serve of Fraser Island. In these
areas gum, box, mulga, Cypress
pine, etc,, are badly infected, in
some places to the point of ex-
tinction. Chief distributing
agents are birds, particularly the
oriole and mistletoe-bird. Rad-
cliffe indicates that the blossom-
eating little red flying-fox may
be responsible in part for long-
range distribution.
Only known natural checks
are the possum and koala. Ex-
perimental tests establish that
both will eat avidly of mistletoe;
the koala only when the plant
grows upon a eucalypt host.
The limited koala population
renders it negligible as a con-
trolling factor, but a strong case
appears for continued total pro-
tection for the possum.
Although of world-wide and
ancient lineage, the Australian
mistletoe, of which there are
many species, is indigenous to
this country. That it is unknown
in Tasmania lends support to
flying-fdx dissemination, for the
red-fox migrations extend only
to the northern districts of Vic-
toria, where climatic conditions
become adverse. This, with legis-
lative action, has enabled Vic-
toria to reasonably control
mistletoe, but no other State has
taken direct action against it.
Measures such as poisoning
the host and indiscriminate use
of the axe have raised more
problems than they have solved,
and it would appear that only
some biological factor will prove
successful. Not only is the
preservation of millable timber
and fodder-trees at stake; there
is involved also siltation of
streams*and soil erosion con-
sequent on timber destruction.
Grasshoppers and Crows.
“Agric”: Walter Gunn, Kil-
donan, Goondiwindi, who has
been keeping a close watch on
grasshopper infestations for
some years, advocates the pre-
servation of crows to keep them
in check. One of his properties
last year carried the biggest
swarm of grasshoppers he had
seen. Crows came in and de-
stroyed 60 per cent, almost im-
mediately and later reinforce-
ments cleaned up the ’hoppers.

Gunn contends that an upset in
the balance of Nature is respon-
sible for the ’hoppers reaching
plague proportions in recent
years. Man destroyed timber,
and the laying of poison-baits
for rabbits, dingoes, etc., also
destroyed birds. After watching
the position closely for some
years, and having tried various
methods to control the ’hoppers,
Gunn has come to the conclu-
sion that the problem will never
adequately be tackled until a
natural enemy of the ’hoppers is
found and protected.
Working Beehives.
“Bumble”: Have the smoker
well alight and direct a puff of
smoke in the entrance, after
which lift the cover and send
two or three strong whiffs of
smoke between the frames. This
should quieten bees of reason-
able temperament, but if there
are signs of them ganging-up
aggressively mord smoking is
needed. Hives are ‘easiest
handled on moderately hot days,
when the bees are working
strongly; in cold weather they
don’t readily make inroads into
honey and may be uncertain in
temper. Make sure they are
quietened before lifting frames.
A hive-tool or strong knife
is needed when removing
frames, doqe by prising the
others away and lifting one of
the outside ones. Stand it aside,
using the space in the box to
work through the others. Honey
ready for extraction varies from
practically fully-sealed combs in
cold climates and wet seasons to
sealed half-over in hot, dry, in-
land districts. It’s far better to
err on the liberal side when, de-
ciding how much honey stores to
leave for tiding the colonies over
till the next flow of nectar.
Frames should always be
handled vertically; on a hori-
zontal plane the combs may
fracture or drop out. Bees may
be shaken from them by a quick
flick of the wrists above the
hive and any remaining brushed
off with a light switch of grass
or leaves. Brood - combs
shouldn’t be exposed unneces-
sarily long to hot sun or chill
winds. Provided there isn’t too
much disturbance the queen may
often be easily found among the
brood-combs where the latest
egg-laying has been done.
Too much interference and
displacement of combs may up-
set small colonies and cause
them to swarm out; in fact,
avoid opening hives unless
strictly necessary, and then for
only short periods. Close down
operations if robber-bees from
other hives become too per-
sistent, for trouble of this nature
may quickly get out of hand.
Return an outside frame last of
all, having the bees off it and a
generous space left; then space
the others and fit the cover
securely.
Hints for the Farm.
“E. 2”: The woodheap axe is
probably subject to more abuse
than any other tool, and a handle
of Australian hardwood doesn’t
last long in ordinary circum-
stances. Keeping the blade rea-
sonably sharp helps, as does
avoiding sideways levering to
twist a piece of split wood off a
log. The handle should be care-
fully fitted and not allowed to
become loose. Leaving the axe
out in all weathers doesn’t give
the handle a chance.
“W. Court”; The most potent
cause of weeds seriously com-
peting with pasture grasses is
too-heavy concentration of stock
on the pasture, inevitably result-
ing in the denudation of the
grass. Overstocking, if con-
tinued long enough, will result
in the grass giving way under a
blanket of useless weeds. In-
creasing poverty of the soil also
has a lot to to with grasslands
becoming weed - ridden. Both
conditions are remediable.
“Sarina”: One great fallacy
is that clocks and watches are
rendered unserviceable by over-
winding. Experts declare that
no timepiece can be over-wound
unless the owner uses consider-
able force. They advise that
timepieces be always wound to
the fullest capacity, and that the
winding be done at the same
hour every day. Doing this in-
creases the useful life of the
spring and helps the clock or
watch to keep accurate time.
“Myrrhee”: Bor red, brown
or black scale on citrus in Vic-
toria, use a white or red oil
emulsion, Ipint in 4gal. of water.
Apply mid-March and again in
mid-December. For aphis,
spray with nicotine sulphate,
one fluid ounce in 4gal. of
water, plus 2oz. of soap as a
spreader.
“Myrr”: To keep a flighty
fowl on the ground cut all the
long feathers on the left wing
except the outer three, leaving
the secondary feathers un-
touched. This prevents flight
and allows the wing to close
against the body without detri-
ment to appearance or exposing
the vulnerable flank to weather
changes, as happens when the
whole of the wing-feathers are
hacked off.
“Ben Acre”: When a leaking
tail-valve prevents you from
priming a centrifugal-pump, and
such circumstances as a high
river make it impossible to re-
pair it, open a joint in the tail-
pipe and pour in loose earth,
washing it down with water.
Avoid sand. The earth will
settle against the valve, holding
the water until pumping starts,
when it is quickly washed out.
Don’t try it with other pumps.
“C.A.A,”: Water cut off for a
day can bring about an earlier
moult and then older birds will
not come back into production
until June or July. In young
stock a “neck moult” could result
in no eggs for six to eight weeks.
Don’t put medicines or disin-
fectants in the water, and keep
vessels clean. Where medicines
are necessary they should be
mixed with a mash.
“E.M.R.”: To grow ducklings
for table use do not allow free
range after they are six weeks
old. They should be confined in
small runs with shelter from
rain, sun and wind, but definitely
not in sheds. Where they camp
at night should be dry and clean
as possible. Do not overcrowd.
“Billjim”: As a winter vege-
table Brussels sprouts is not cul-
tivated to the extent it should
be in Australia, Superior to
cabbage in flavor, it is more
economical in the' home-garden
and no harder to grow. For
midwinter use plant during
March in heavily-manured soil,
allowing at least 3ft. square for
each plant. Pests common to
both cabbage and sprouts are
easier to control in the sprouts.
Lead-arsenate, loz. to 2gal, of
water, applied regularly, will
dispose of caterpillars, while the
addition of \oz. of nicotine-sul-
phate will combat aphis.

BRIAN BUREAU.
Quite a Surprise.
“The Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister, M. Zorin, whose visit to
Czechoslovakia during the ‘crisis’ was
made ‘to supervise the delivery of
Soviet wheat,’ has left Prague.”
Interviewed by Tass Agency
on his return to Moscow, M.
Zorin said he had been speci-
ally selected by the Politburo to
supervise the wheat deliveries to
Czechoslovakia because of his
wide experience in drawing up
agenda at Deputy Foreign
Ministers’ conferences, his speci-
“Domino!”
alised knowledge of escape
clauses in bilateral treaties and,
above all, his acquaintance with
the tactics in debate of the re-
spective diplomatic representa-
tives of Nicaragua and Luxem-
bourg.
His supervision of the de-
liveries of Soviet wheat, or,
rather, the preliminaries to the
deliveries, had evoked tremend-
ous enthusiasm among the
Czechs, and it had proved a most
interesting job.
At first, said M. Zorin, he
had decided that the most eco-
nomic delivery of wheat would
be by the construction of an
endless belt which would con-
nect the collectivised wheat-
farms of the Russian steppes
and the flour-mills in Prague.
He had come to this decision
after a profound study of certain
sub-clauses of the Atlantic
Charter. On this endless belt,
power for which would be drawn
from the great projected Pipe-
dreamski hydro-electric scheme
which would be put into opera-
tion when American and British
consultants were available, the
ears of wheat, cut by the latest-
type sickles, would be placed.
He had unfortunately been
compelled to abandon this idea
when it was pointed out to him
that most of the grain would be
lost en route because of the de-
predations of birds, and in any
case the grain, through being
jolted out of the ears, would
never get to the mills.
After a prolonged study of
the old Treaty of Utrecht he
had hit upon a more effective
method of handling bulk de-
livery. By putting the wheat
up in 21b. brown-paper bags
and transporting if by camel
convoy the incidence of pilfer-
ing would practically be elimi-
nated. The Czech authorities,
however, had pointed out that,
taking into consideration the
q Uan tity promised, it would take
750 000 camels to shift It over
2i years. The problem of pro-
visioning the animals was ex-
ceeded only by getting sufficient
drivers who could pronounce
the order “Hoostha! ” A subse-
nt study of the Yalta Agree-
ment the London Treaty and
the p ower of Veto in the U N .
3 ecurd y Council had ultimately
conv j nced him of the soundness
of thig argument
alternative scheme to shift
the wheat by the Russian State
Railways had had to be aban-
doned on several counts. Firstly,
the element in which the grain
took root was so permanent a
feature of the floors of Soviet
railway trucks that bulk wheat,
if placed in them, would quickly
germinate and grow. By the
time a necessarily long journey
was completed the wheat would
be shooting through the roofs.
In any case, when the rain got
into the trucks the grain would
swell, with a consequent risk of
bursting the sides of the trucks.
Finally, there could be no cer-
tainty that trucks consigned
from the wheatfields to Czecho-
slovakia would not, either this
year or next, turn up at Mur-
mansk, Vladivostok or Astra-
khan.
The possibility of shifting
consignments by air had been
considered after an intensive
study of international law and
certain protocols still extant.
This could have been effected
economically by using converted
army bombers. Unfortunately,
there were left intact now only
seven Flying Fortresses and two
Superfortresses, captured when
American crews made forced
landings, and these could not be
rendered airworthy in the
absence of American technicians.
In any case, M. Zorin con-
cluded, there was actually no im-
mediate hurry. Except for a
token delivery of two tons,
which was coming by bullock-
wagon next year, the first of
the big consignments under the
recently - concluded trade-pact
with Czechoslovakia would not
be due until the autumn of 1972,
when the eleventh Five Year
Plan was well into its stride.
Advised by the Tass Agency
Commissar that during his stay
in Prague a coup had given
the Czech Communist party

Industrial Troubles
Of the amount “lost by the Victorian
Government Railways in the last financial
year, £1,150,000 went west because of in-
dustrial stoppages” (B. 21 /1 /’4B). That
raises the question of the liability of the
unions concerned for damages should an
action be brought against them by the
people (the Government), who must make
good the loss.
The successful action by the “S. M.
Herald” against N. S. Wales Railways
for recovery of additional charges in-
curred for carriage of newspapers when
railway transport was refused during a
strike, and the threatened Action by
certain N. S. Wales tradespeople (sup-
ported by a solicitor “Labor” member)
against the Sydney County Council for
losses caused by “blackout,” are useful
pointers. True, these instances involve
breach of contract express or implied,
but in the newspaper case damages might
have been recovered by the Railway Com-
missioner from the union concerned. Ex-
pediency, of course, would be against
such a step, particularly under the present
political set-up.
A manufacturer sustaining loss through
lawless union action must surely have
right of redress. Success would make
unions extremely chary of fomenting
trouble, for norfe of them likes being hit
in the pocket. Civil action should be
possible against a few hundred men and
their union conspiring to put 17,000 men
out of work; or against a few bargees
who hold up a nation’s transport; or
against a militant railway group that
causes the “standing-down” of 5000
workers who are not parties to the dis-
pute.
Union will not act against union be-
cause of “solidarity,” while employers, as
a class, fear reprisals. But the need for
action exists, and sooner or later a cour-
ageous Government or trader will make
a legal test of the liability for Joss arising
out of labor disputes.—N.’W. J. (Vic,).
Compulsory Picnic
The Sydney trade-union concerned
has issued a circular to all muni-
cipal council foremen and gangers
in the metropolitan area, together with
books of tickets for the annual picnic.
On the butts of the tickets is a space for
names and addresses of purchasers.
The circular;
Dear Sir,
I have to inform you that the Union has
decided to hold its annual picnic at Clifton
Gardens on Thursday, March 11, 1948.
I am enclosing herewith a number of
picnic tickets which I shall be pleased if
yo%will dispose of among the members of
your division. Tickets are 3s. each and
cover wife and children under 16 years of
age or lady friend.
The picnic day is an award holiday for
all employees of the Council’s service, and
to maintain this day it is necessary that
all those in your area should take a picnic
ticket.
It is assured you will have no difficulty
in having each employee take a ticket, as
they are required to purchase a ticket, but
should any employee refuse or fail to do
so, I will ask you to bring his name under
my notice immediately.
I am also enclosing a circular which will
acquaint the employees of the sports events
to be competed for.
So now we even have compulsory recrea-
tion.— Gilgai (N.S.W.).
The R.A.A.F.
The war is more than two years over
and our main mobile assault weapon —
the Air Force —slowly but surely stag-
nates and disintegrates near our capital
cities. Our maintenance and replacement
facilities are still sited as if we expected
any future attack to come from Heard
Island.
An aircraft needing an engine change
at Darwin or Townsville remains
grounded while Sydney or Melbourne
dispatch a replacement. Major overhauls
are still not possible north of Brisbane.
Our pilots still “attack” modem naval
fleets in Beaufighters, while swarms of
400-knot Bearcats restrain themselves.
Our 70-to-90-gallon-an-hour Dakotas
go into “recess” and a Lancastrian using
twice the fuel, with less than half the pay-
load, takes over and puts our transport
pilots on the shelf. And that with our
dollar shortage for fuel purchases.
Mustangs are still our best fighter-type.
while half the world is equipping itself
with jet-propelled aircraft.
Our operational groups must be
manned and equipped with the least
delay. Their home ground must be the
Arafura Sea. Our maintenance group
should be sited in Central Australia and
a field-maintenance centre should be
built around it with a capacity to handle
complete overhauls and to maintain a
full reserve of serviceable spares.
Each operational group could consist
of a fighter wing, a mixed-bomber wing
and a general-purpose wing, made up of
a search, rescue and recce, squadron,
a transport squadron and a target-towing
and special-duties squadron.
An ops. group at both Batchelor Field
and the Townsville area would give us
full interlocking cover where it is needed
most.
Training-centres in the southern States
would dispatch their fully-trained rein-
forcements, and our aircrew “on service”
could be rotated and “converted” from
group to group and type to type.
Another urgent need is an intermediate
dual-control, fast single-engined trainer.
The jump from Wirraway to Mustang is
spectacular, but risky.— Van (N.S.W.).
“Bumps and Circuits”
After six years’ wartime flying of
everything from Moths to Catalinas under
most conditions, I am convinced land-
ing is the most dangerous part of flying,
“If y' come across a letter scented with ‘Paris Violets' it's for me."
but it does not now receive the continued
training it requires.
During those six years “circuits and
bumps” were part of my training from
shortly after initial solo flights right
through my service careen The training
was still there on operational tours,
especially if the old jnan was at all
conscientious. It consisted of repeated
take-offs and landing along the one strip,
each circuit normally occupying about 10
minutes.
We all hated it, but I wonder how
many of us would have “pranged” but
for this constant training. It was
monotony with a vengeance. Cockpit-drill
became habit, judgment of approach was
more accurate and all faults were cor-
rected, frequently by the old man over
the radio-telephone. After a while we
became proficient in landing and take-
offs. But that was not enough; we Jhad
to remain proficient. And so the “cir-
cuits and bumps” continued, night and
day. Sometimes it was at first light, and
with the “morning-after-the-night-before”
feeling I often swore dry for months.
Although I often cursed the R.A.A.F.
and the nobs that ran it, I still hand it
to ’em for training good safe pilots. Un-
fortunately these last two years have seen
a marked drop in R.A.A.F. training of
qualified pilots, the service evidently
thinking its “super-trained” men did not
need any more. When I read of the
tragic Lincoln crash at Amberley last
month I wondered if it was through lack
of landing training. The pilot, who had
misjudged his approach, gave his plane
the gun when it was too late and the
machine subsequently stalled.
The R.A.A.F. and all civil air com-
panies must continue the important train-
ing in landing and taking-off. There are
no two chances when you hit the deck
hard. Lessons of safe flying learnt during
the war must still be remembered and
taught.— Waddlin’ Willie (Vic.).
Salvage
As a dollar-saving scheme, which
could well be adopted here, Britain has
initiated a new national campaign to
salvage waste. Local council heads and
trade-union leaders have been given such
facts as the potential value of 200,000
tons of paper wasted in the country every
year:—
Repulped, a ton of this paper could pro-
vide wall- and ’ceiling-boards for 12 new
homes. During the war local authorities
collected nearly half a million tons of
waste-paper in one year—in eight years,
from 1939, the total of all materials sal-
vaged weighed 11,000,000 tons, worth £2B
million sterling. In addition 153,000 tons
of bottles and jars collected realised
£850,000; 107,000 tons of broken glass
gave £133,000; and 560,000 tons of cinders
were worth £303,000,
Organising the campaign, the British
Board of Trade intends to smash all war-
time records, and will gather 30 other
raw materials beside paper. It hopes to
have the whole plan oiled and working
by June. — Dinosaur (N.S.W.).
Malays and Pearling
The Minister for the Interior has just
announced that the recent disturbances at
Broome were caused by Malay divers
consorting with aboriginal women. He
apparently believes that the trouble could
be eliminated if the Malays were allowed
to bring their wives to Australia.
The Minister may not know that pearl-
ing is done at sea and not on land.
Luggers remain at sea for four or five
months and do not go near Broome until
they drop in for the half-yearly overhaul,
so bringing their wives to Australia would
not help the Malays. Nor could the
women go to sea and live aboard the
luggers, as there would be no room.
Luggers receive monthly rations from
a schooner which takes the pearlshell
from them and from which they are
directed where to work. The main object
is to keep the crews working at sea and
not allow them near Broome or any other
town until the half-yearly overhaul or
the annual layup.— Seaput (N.S.W.).

“Government Assistance ,,
“Tidapa” (B. 11/2/’4B) seems to think
that, although private enterprise may
have muddled along well enough in the
past, modern conditions are such that
the Government must help private in-
dustry to keep it alive.
Well, I’ve .been working for a long
time, mostly with my hands, and can re-
member the time when about one in every
seven or eight worked for the Govern-
ment, “helping” me. In those days a
man earning the money I earn would
pay little or no direct tax, and he could
buy about three times the quantity of
goods with his money—and that without
presenting any licence or permits, break-
ing any laws or regulations. Today, with
the number of Government “helpers”
doubled, it costs me a third of my income
in direct taxes; what it costs me in
indirect taxes and subsidies I do not
know.
Further, the things I might buy with
the devalued* currency left to me are in
such short supply that you can’t get a
packet of envelopes within a hundred
miles of this town. I got a shoeing-rasp
the other day after having had it on order
for two years. The house I am living in
has no stove because I cannot buy one.
Even at that, if I left the place tomorrow
100 people would be here ready to put up
a struggle for the key.
In the light of these facts it seems to
me that when Government “help” was
at half its present strength, civil servants
were so busy doing their own work that
they had no time to sit round “helping”
me with dreamed-up plans gazetted to
work out at a brick house and the equiva-
lent of a thousand a year for everybody
A plan like that may be all right in itself,
but there are thousands of them, made
by men who do nothing else but make
plans in a town whose inhabitants live in
the main on the things they see in*their
minds. Their visions have been rolling
off the assembly lines at such a rate that
they’ve got the traffic held up all over the
country.
Out in the world we dream our dreams
too, but we are rarely paid for them until
they are built into something more solid
than a blueprint. If the scheme is a
failure we have to stand our own losses.
Some rule like that should be applied to
these Government planners. Then, al-
though we might still have to listen to
them, we would not be compelled to pay
unheard-of rates for the verbiage.—
Ardizan (Q.).
Root of the Matter
Between £30,000 and £40,000 is ex-
pected to be lost by the Commonwealth
Government on the ill-fated Beaufort
prefab, “experiment” which had its
genesis in a specimen house opened with
great pomp three years ago in the Fitz-
roy Gardens, Melbourne. Some Federal
officials think the Victorian Govern-
ment should be mulcted for some of the
cost, since it cancelled its order for 5000.
The people who should be mulcted are
Federal and State Labor politicians
like Barry and Lazzarini, who flooded
the air with oratory on that occasion.
But they won’t have to pay, nor will the
Governments concerned —the taxpayer
will. Anyhow, the present Victorian Gov-
ernment didn’t start the thing—it stopped
it getting into a worse mess. —C. B. (Vic.).
In Brisbane the president of the
United Retailers, Fielding, said there
was no further need for clothes ration-
ing, and it would have ended before
Christmas “if the British crisis hadn’t de-
veloped.” As it was, British clothing
material exported to Australia couldn’t
be sold because of coupon limits. The
statement attracted some notice, and
there was a conference:- Chifley, Cour-
tice, Coles of the Rationing Commission.
Naturally a decision has been “deferred.”
—One Suit (Q.).
Adelaide “Advertiser’s” Canberra man,
looking into the proposal to increase the
size of Parliament, believes that it “will
guarantee practically every sitting
member of the House a safe seat for life
or as long as he can continue to command
party preselection.” There is no such
thing as a “safe seat” .when the voters
are fed-up. The Langs and Chifleys dis-
covered that in 1930-31, and the Chifleys
and McGirrs will discover it again.—
Candidate Once (S.A.).
Yugoslav traffic isn’t all one way. Two
hundred and thirty migrants from Tito’s
country arrived in Fremantle to work on
the East-West railway. One of them,
who had been a professor of languages
at Zagreb University but had left his
homeland rather than accept Commu-
nism, had something to say on the sub-
ject of assimilation. He pointed out that
at the camp at Swanboume, near Perth,
there had been no attempt to teach the
new arrivals English, and that when they
began work on the railway they were to
be drafted into small groups among
themselves, and would have no oppor-
tunity of learning the language or Aus-
tralian ways. Segregation is the right
way not to make good Australians out
of newcomers. —O. P. (W.A.).
A Sydney clothing factory estimates
that a girl paid 18s. a day has to machine
six children’s garments to be worth em-
ploying. If she produces seven or eight
she gets a bonus. She rarely qualifies for
it. But married-women employees do;
and now the trend is to get rid of the
flapper and employ the matron who will
really work. They are thinking the same
way in American factories. It’s the story
told in the well-known rhyme about “the
old red hen” as a worm-scratcher. —S. S.
(N.S.W.).
Under “joint control,” Commonwealth
and State, of the N. S. Wales coalmining
industry there was a production-loss
of 341,000 tons in 29 working days. This
was announced simultaneously with par-
ticulars of a Victorian plan for a
£16,000,000 brown-coal project at Mary-
vale South, near Morwell, in the Yallourn
district. There are to be a new open-
cut and two briquetting factories, designed
to produce 1,300,000 tons a year—suffi-
cient to meet half the State’s industrial
requirements. Gas production, which
also suffers from the caprices of N.S.W.
miners, the latest of which is objection to
a pony’s breath, will be served by gas
manufactured at Yallourn and pumped
to Melbourne through an 85-mile pipe-
line.—S. M. (Vic.).
