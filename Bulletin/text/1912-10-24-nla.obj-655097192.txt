Hell-and-Devil Poems by dames
Stephens
The Fulness of Time.
On a rusty iron throne
Past the furthest star of space
I saw Satan sit alone,
Old and haggard was his face;
For his work was done, and he
Rested in eternity.
And to him from out the sun
Came his father and his friend,
Saying, now the work is done,
Enmity is at an end:
And he guided Satan to
Paradises that he knew.
Gabriel without a frown,
Uriel without a spear,
Raphael came singing down
Welcoming their ancient peer,
And they seated him beside
One who . had been crucified.
The Mekky Policeman.
I was appointed guardian by
The Power that frowns along the sky,
To watch the tree and see that none
Plucked of the fruit that grew thereon. ,
There was a robber in the tree,
Who climbed as high as ever he
Was able, at the top he knew
The apple of all apples grew.
The night was dark, the branch was thin,
In every wind lie heard the din
Of angels calling: “ Guardian, see
That no one climbs upon the tree.”
And when he saw me standing there,,
lie shook with terror and despair,
But 1 said to him: “Be at rest,
The best to him who wants the best.”
So I teas sacked, but I have got
A fob in Hell to keep me hot.
What the Devil Said.
It was the night time, God the Father Good
Weary of praises, on a sudden stood
Up from his throne and leaned upon the sky,
lor 'heard a sound, a little cry,
1 Inn as a whisper climbing up the steep.
T> n^i. SO i }°°k e d to where the Earth asleep
with the moon, He saw the whirling
Swing round the world in surgent energy,
langling the moonlight in its netted foam.
And nearer saw the white and fretted dome
Of the ice-capped pole spin back a larded
ray
To whistling stars, bright as a wizard’s day.
But these He passed with eyes intently wide,
dill closer still the mountains He espied
(squatting tremendous on the broad-backed
Earth;
Each nursing twenty rivers at a birth.
And then minutely sought He for the cry
Mgh^ ie s^ s P ace so hugely
H e found it in a ditch outside a town,
A tattered, hungry woman crouching down
Pi® dead Babe—so there was nought to do,
lor what is done is done, and back He drew,
baa to His Heaven of ivory and gold;
And as He sat, all suddenly there rolled
trorn where the tvoman wept upon the sod
isatans deep voice, “O thou unhappy God!”
Under the Bracken.
A body lay upon a hill,
And over it the bracken swung;
1 he which had housed many an ill
Of hand and heart and tongue:
it was so foul the angels who
lit the dead for living flew
Irom where the corpse was flung.
Then all the ills that had been sted
in the heart and in the head,
s^n an d shame he knew
When he gloried in the sun
Rose from Hell again and fletv,
r illed with indignation,
And did what the angel crew
Gould not bring themselves to do.
Thay cleaned him more white Han snow,
I hey purged him of every stain,
touting their .own bodies so
i hey might not be clean again:
But • u.ien the living from the dead
Arose _ again, the angels said:
Behold, our work was not in vain.”
7 * 6 HiU °* Vision (Maunsel,
The Russian Dramatist
In. the evolution of the drama it is the
Kussian playwright that supplies the most
revolutionary ideas. Tchekov, with his
group-emotions,” is utterly foreign to an
iimglish audience; even Strindberg comes
nearer to our conception of a play; but
Maxim Gorki and Andreyev reveal to us con-
ceptions of dramatic art toward which the
English drama shows no sign of moving one
step.
T ~he Lower Depths, by Maxim Gorki
translated by Laurence Irving (Unwin, per
Gymocks Library), merely presents us with
a sandwich of life. Things happen, of course
in the cave-like night shelter in a Russian
city, wherem are gathered together some 16
representatives of the dregs of civilisation
for instance, one of the characters dies; but
such an incident is merely the surface ripple
that leaves the lower depths still in their
stagnant misery. At the end of the four
acts there is a hint that the advent of the
old pilgrim, Luka, with his simple philoso-
phy of Love one another,” has stirred
momentarily some response in the sodden
souls of the outcasts. But the art of Gorki
consists in picturing to us the faintness of
the possibility that any change could be
worked in his characters. There is tragedy
and comedy in the interplay of these quarrel-
some, degraded, miserable, child-like inhabi-
tants of the night shelter; but the lesson
of the play is that this state of things will
go on indefinitely ; the dramatist has given
you a mere section of the human sandwich ;
the rest of it is just like the four acts you
have sampled.
There is Satine, who is tired of words:—
“I ih tired, mate, of all our human speech
all of our words. I’m sick of ’em. I’ve
heard ’em every single one at least a
thousand times 1 love difficult, rare
words. When I was a little chap I was in
a telegraph office read a heap of books
There are some very good books and
quantities of curious words.”
Into the quarrelling, inarticulate, cloudy-
minded community comes the old beggar with
his philosophy—or hint of a philosophy—as
haltingly expressed as are the complaints of
the others:—•
‘‘All of us—-are all men! You can pre-
tend all you like, and give yourself all the
airs, but a man you were born, and a man
you have to die. And I see, for all folks
gets wiser and busier... .and though they
live worse and worse.... they’ve the will to
live better the stiff-necks Whoever
it is, all of us is of value.”
Satine asks Luka the difficult question,
“Why are men alive?” and Luka has his
naive explanation:
“They live for the better man. Now, let’s
say, there’s carpenters and the rest—masses
people. And then out of them a carpen-
ter s born a carpenter such as never was
in all the world ; above ’em all; never was
his like fer carpent’ring. ’E stamps ’imself
on the whole carpent’ring trade.... shoves
the whole thing 20 years forward. And so for
all the others And even the gentrv—they
live for the better man! Each thinks ’e’s
hvin fer ’imself, yet it turns out it’s for
that better man. A ’undred years....and
maybe longer, we ’as to go on livin’ till the
better man! All in their way live for the
better man. Therefore, you must show re-
spect f unto a 11.... it’s clear we can’t know
who e is, why ’e was born, and what ’e can
d 0.... e may have been born for our ’appi-
ness.. . .to bring us ’elp. And most of all
....that we must respect children.... the
little bits of mites !”
Gorki presents his sandwich of life, and
it is a real sandwich. Ilis characters live:
the mere fact that they are allowed so to
live. is sufficient indictment; he needs no
ending, happy or unhappy—there is no “cur-
tain to the existence of rhese inhabitants of
the lower depths. When one of them dies
another merely says: “Won’t cough no more,
that means. You must tell Klesshtsk [her
husband] it’s his business”; and another
remarks to her husband: “You must have
her out! Out into the passage! Can’t
keep dead bodies in here; here the living
have to sleep” ; while the pilgrim comments :
“For what and how shall we pity the
dead? The living we don’t pity and
ourselves we don’t pity why her?”
J*
One wonders whether King-Hunger, by
the Russian, Leonid Andreyev (Richard G.
Badger, Boston), has ever been staged, or
whether it could ever be staged. It is a
terrible dramatisation of hunger and the
oppression of the workers by modern capital.
The characters include “King-Hunger,”
“Death,” “Time,” and the many-throated
mob. The time is the present, The theme
is developed with extraordinary symbolism,
with passages of sternest realism, and with
dramatic effects calling for a stage the size
of a paddock. Here, for instance, in the
opening scene :
The first impression that forcibly seizes
upon a chance spectator is that of the many-
throated, complex, yet rhythmical noises of
the operating machines, and of the thousands
of men appendant to them. The uniform,
heavy gasping of steam engines; the hum-
ming and hissing of flying wheels; the whir-
ring of endless belts; the dull, infrequent
and earth-quivering blows of the massive,
mechanical drop hammers. On the back-
ground of these dead, ponderous, cruelly in-
variable sounds, as if independent of man’s
volition, a sprightly, volatile, but rhythmical
clattering of many small hammers....
At the rise of the curtain the stage repre-
sents the interior of the factory in black
and red. The red, the fiery—these are the
lights of the furnaces, the incandescent bars
of iron over which hammer dark shadows of
men. The black, the shapeless, like descend-
ing gloom—these, are the silhouettes of the
monstrous machines, whimsical structures
assuming the menacing aspect of a night-
mare. Sternly impassive they press with all
their might, and crush the men with their
colossal weight. The pillars supporting them
bear resemblance to the paws of monstrous
beasts... .Weight and quietude and gloom,
and it seems as if from every corner gloat
wide-open, fixed, blind eyes.
And as small black shadows swarm the
men below. Eagerness is absent in their
movements; there is no ardent, impetuous
freedom of gesture. Regularly and auto-
matically they talk and move, in measure
with the hammers and the working ma-
chines; and when some one juts out of the
mass, he seems as if a piece clipped off the
gloomy machine, the odd structure appear-
ing like some obscure monstrosity.
J*
The chorus of the workmen sounds, punc-
tuated by the three consecutive notes of the
great drop hammer: —
“We are starving... .We are crushed by
the machines We ourselves are part of
the machines.... We are the glowing fur-
naces.... We are the food for the machines.
.... Let us pray to the machines! Who is
all-powerful in the world? The machine.
Who is most fair, most wealthy, and all-
wise? The machine. What is the. earth?
A machine. What is man? A machine.”
(Thrice in stern assent strikes the drop
hammer.)
And, desperate, they call for King-Hunger
to laffease them; and he comes—a terrible
figure. One of the workmen exclaims:—
“I am a working-man. lam as old as the
earth. I have performed all the 12 labors
....dug and vexed the earth, built cities,
and have so altered her face that the Creator
nimselt would not readily recognise her.
But I can’t say why I did all this. Whose
will did I shape? To what end did I aspire?
My head is dull. I am dead tired. My
strength empresses me. Explain it to me, O
King! Or I’ll clutch this hammer and
crack the earth as a hollow nut.”
King-Hunger replies: “Patience, ray son !
have your powers for the last great revolt.
Then you’ll know all.”
In the second scene we have a flat, black
wall running upwards. On the top there
are brilliantly lighted windows, behind which
the capitalists are taking part in a dance,
and on to the balcony of which occasionally
beautiful, women and cultured men stroll,
love-making; while below in the underground
apartments of'the building a meeting of the
dispossessed takes place.
In all assembled about 20 persons. They
are street-walking strumpets, hooligans, pettv
thieves, cut-throats, paupers, cripples and
other scum of the great city—the most hor-
rible that poverty, vice, crime and eternal
insatiable hunger of the soul can produce
....lhe almost entire absence of the fore-
head, the monstrous form of the skull, the
large jaws, something either bestial or brutal
in gait and movement, make them appear
as beings of an altogether singular race.
Ihey discuss methods of exterminating
the. capitalists, from destroying their books
to infecting them with their own diseases.
The speeches are hardly quotable.
In the next scene we see the trial of the
starving in an immense court room, with
the aristocrats delighted spectators, all
dressed as for a ball. King-Hunger is the
judge, and Death an interested guest of
honor.
Then we see the revolt of the starving and
the treachery of King-Plunger. The city is
burning, and the rich huddle together in a
gieat ballroom. They are saved by a dirty
engineer, whose great projectiles decimate
the mob. And in the final scene we see Iving-
II linger leaning on a machine gun, survey-
ing the corpses of the starving. The victors
inspect the great battlefield, as if it were a
show. In the city, chains are being forged
for the prisoners. And suddenly a terror
strikes the complacent victors. At the com-
mand of King-Hunger, the dead arise, and,
in horror, the victors run howling from the
battlefield.
Jt
The terrible allegory is developed with
almost fiendish malignity. In the trial of
the starving, the prisoners are brought in
one by one, their faces encased in wire
muzzles. The chatter of the gloating specta-
tors is of the most trivial things, while the
examination brings out the most dreadful of
horrors. Here, for instance, is a fragment
of the examination
The starvling is led into the room. She is
a graceful, hut extremely emaciated young
woman, with a face pallid and tragic to view.
....Her voice is apathetic and dull.
What’s your offence, starvling?”
“I killed my child.”
“Oh, horrors! This women is altogether
destitute of motherly feelings.”
“What do ycu expect of them? You as-
tonish me.”
“Crimes of infanticide were not regarded
as such in ancient times, and were looked
upon as a natural right of parents. Only
with the introduction of humanism into our
customs
P^ ease > just a second, professor.”
But science, my child”
Iving-Plungeb : Tell us, starvling, how it
happened.
(With drooping hands and motionless, the
woman speaks up dully and dispassion-
ately.)
Young Woman: One night my baby and I
crossed the long bridge over the river.
And since I had long before decided, so
i
then approached the middle, where
the river is deep and swift, I
said, ‘“Look, baby, how the water
is a-roaring below.” She said,
I can’t reach, mamma, the railing
is so high.” I said, “Come, let me lift
you, baby dear.” And when she was
gazing down into the black deep, I thre
her over. That’s all.
King-llungeb: Did she grip you?
Young Woman: No.
King-Hunger: She screamed?
Y_oung Woman : Yes, once.
King-Hunger : What was her name?
Young Woman : Baby dear.
King-Hunger : No, her name. How wa
she called?
Young Woman: Baby dear.
And in the middle of the wholesale con
demnation of these wretches the court ha
luncheon. A gargantuan meal is brough
into the court-room, and the spectators anc
judges proceed to stuff themselves.
The appeal of this remarkable play, even
inadequately produced, would be immediat
and sickening. Only out of Russia coulc
such a drama come.
—_—.
The London Bookman (6d.) for Sept
has a special article, written by one A. St
John Adcock, upon the literature of Greater
Britain. The cover shows portraits o:
‘‘Rolf Boldrewood” and Ralph Connor, the
Canadian author, and a presentation plate
portrait of ‘‘Rolf Boldrewood” is also given
Ihe special qualifications of A. St. John
Adcock for writing upon what he terms the
literature of the “colonies” do not appear in
his articles. He has, from his distance anc
with his lack of appreciation of the Austra-
lasian outlook, valiantly attempted to sample
our literature, but the pabulum lias not been
assimilated. He rightly points out that the
Australian Kiplings” have been less in-
fluenced by that writer than by our own
Gordon, that more poets are living and pub-
lishing m Australia than in England, and
that their works have immeasurably larger
sales than those of any but the very chief
of the latter-day English poets. He adds:
‘lt is because there is nothing approaching
that demand for poetry over here that I con-
sistently advise our home poets to emigrate,
and wonder why they do not.” We pass the
information on to our immigration authori-
ties, who can be depended to apply the lan-
guage test in Turkish if there is any sign
of an influx of English laureates. He quotes
Bernard O’Dowd that, with rare exceptions,
the partially educated news reporters” of the
daily press have not the courage to pro-
nounce for or against a book before seeing
a London opinion on it. Also, John Ber-
nard O’Hara is quoted as stating that Prof.
Tucker is “our supreme literary authority” !
Arthur W. Jose explains that the Aus-
tralian writer is greatly lacking in apprecia-
tion of form. “This is probably due to the
circumstance that few writers here can
adopt literature as a profession, the gains are
not enough, and there is too much other work
to be done; and we have not the plethora
of literary periodicals that offer such large
markets to authors in England and the
United States, and the few leisured folks to
be found among us are rarely interested in
any sort of literature.” Of present-day
Maoriland literature, Adcock confesses, there
is comparatively little that has come to the
knowledge of the stay-at-home Englishman.
Many portraits of Australasian writers are
given, including one of E. W. Cole, whose
works specified are: A White Australia Im-
possible, Federation of the Whole World,
Truth and The Fun Doctor. On the author-
ity of Adcock, we hereby formally adopt
E. W. Cole into the literary hierarchy of
Australia.
Written by enthusiasts for enthusiasts,
The Poetry Review (34 Norfolk-street,
btrand, London; annual subscription, ss.
post free) leads a forlorn hope. A survey of
the first eight monthly issues does not arouse
vibrant enthusiasm. Each issue contains
articles on subjects connected with poetry,
original work by one modern poet,
with a prefatory critical appreciation, and
reviews of all current books of poetry. Con-
tributions are solicited by the editor, 93
Chancery-lane, London, but the rate of
payment is apparently far below that ob-
taining in The Bulletin. Still, if you are
an enthusiast.... ! The quality of the
poetry discovered and printed by this re-
view, too, does not say much for the poets
of Britain-—or perhaps these geniuses prefer
the other magazines which apparently pay
fairly high rates for poetry. Any issue of
The Bulletin or The Lone Hand has
more_ vital stuff in it. The editor announces
a prize of £3O for the best poem published
in the Review during this year—too late
now for Australasian entries, and hopes to
offer an award of £lOO for the best poem
printed during 1913. The editor disclaims
any desire to. “discover” one new poet per
month; certainly he has not hitherto done
so. He lugubriously states that “most of
the best modern work is interesting rather
as experiment than as achievement,” and
blames . the publishers—seduced by the £2O
publishing fee —for the indiscriminate over-
production of bad verse. One of the issues
(August) has value, inasmuch as it fairly
well covers the ground of “Modern French
Roetry.” One asks why a review devoted
to poetry should be dull?

Beauty’s Favourite.
The article which excels all others
in improving the beauty of the sKin
is naturally and deservedly beauty’s
favourite. This has been the
acknowledged and honoured
position held by Pears’ Soap for
nearly 120 years. It won, and has
maintained that position by virtue
of its complete purity, and by the
possession of those special emollient
properties which soften, refine,
and impart natural colour to the
Bkin. No other soap possesses
these qualities in such a pre*
eminent degree as

Condemned to be life-long
Invalid.
Restored to Health by
“ Wincarnis. ”
Mrs. SARAH DE VILLE, Burton-
on-Trent, writes: —
Dear Sirs, —A few months ago
I was so dangerously ill that the
doctors said they could do nothing
more for me, and advised me to
make the best I could of life, as I
should never be well again. I was
terribly upset at the prospect of
being a life-long invalid, and when
a friend of mine urged me to try
“Wincarnis,” I applied to you for
one of your free trial bottles. I was
astonished and delighted to find that
from the first glassful your “Win-
earnis” put new life into me. I perse-
vered with “Wincarnis,” and before
long I was able to get about again.
Instead of remaining a, life-long in-
valid, I was now able to carry on
business, and I owe all my renewed
health and strength entirely to your
wonderful “Wincarnis.”
Yours very gratefully,
SARAH DE VILLE.
So weak, could hardly walk.
“ Wincarnis ” gave new life.
52 Nightingale Road, Dover.
Dear Sirs, —I feel in duty bound
to write and thank you for the won-
derful benefit I have derived from
your splendid “Wincarnis.” For
months I have been depressed and
nervous, and so weak that I could
hardly walk, and felt I wanted to
be always sitting or lying down.
But your “Wincarnis” has put New
Life into me. I can now go about
my work with a new vigor, that
makes my household duties a pleas-
ure, instead of a burden as before.
I cannot properly express my grati-
tude for the grand health your life-
giving “Wincarnis” has given me.
It is splendid to feel so strong and
well. I have told all my neighbors
about your wonderful “Wincarnis,”
and I feel I want to tell the whole
world what a splendid tonic and re-
storative it is.
Yours very gratefully,
(Mrs.) C. B. BARN ATT.
Business, Robbery, etc,
From Edward S. Paul, Superintendent of
Schweppes, Ltd.: A Bulletin contributor comments
(19/9/’l2) on the Victorian Drivers’ Award, with
particular reference to the aerated water section.
He says: “The drivers have been particularly ill-
treated. It took nine years’ hard battling to get a
Wages Board, and then it took another two years to
get a working determination. This is part of an
organised effort of the employers to smash one par-
ticular union, etc.” Your correspondent, on the
facts, is wide of the mark. About seven years ago
the Aerated Waters Board determination came into
force, and from that date wages have been gradually
increased. Whether the increase should have been
more rapid is another matter. At ho time did the
carters in this industry apply to have their wages
dealt with by the Board, and if they had they would
have received every assistance from the employers.
The days when employers cried aloud that if wages
were increased they would have to close up are gone
by, and now only ultra-conservative employers object
to Wages Boards. Comparing the procedure under
the N.S.W. and Victorian Acts, that of the latter is
antiquated and cumbersome. In Victoria the em-
ployers’ and employees’ representatives (generally
five a side with a chairman) meet and harangue on
whether the wage should be (say) 40s. or 505., and
when the barter reaches a deadlock the chairman de-
livers a casting vote. In N.S.W. the Board takes
and records the evidence on both sides and decides
in camera on that evidence. The Victorian Drivers’
Board, I am informed, called no evidence on the
conditions but only on the wages paid in the
trade, and simply abolished the labor of
all boys and youths. After the employers’
deputation to Minister Murray, referred to
in your article, the Drivers Board amended its
award to admit of the employment of youths not
over 16 years of age, and as youths of this age are
both unobtainable and useless for the work, the
Board’s amendment is merely a blind to justify the
union’s position. The union apparently looks with
holy horror on youths under 21, and should read
your leading article on this very point in the same
issue referred to. The employers don’t even seek to
employ any driver under 21, but they do claim that
the youth who minds the cart or assists the carter
in taking the bottles in and empties out should be
paid youth’s wages. I should like to hear The
Bulletin's criticism on the Chairman of the Board,
the Rev. Hughes, of St. Peter’s, who not only made
the award in these terms, but amended it as above.
These are the sort of awards which rouse up the an-
tagonism of the employers and send them into op-
position instead of securing their sympathy. An
award of this sort from a pulpit orator is sur-
* » *
What a farce the Victorian Dairy Supervision
Act is, because of its “optional” clauses, is shown
by some recent figures published by the Age.
Though 107 municipalities are under the Act, and
only 99 outside it, those that are outside are mostly
the cow parts of the State. So 160,000 cows get
the benefit of departmental inspection and 508,7 v 7
don’t. With pigs the case is even worse, because of
the prevalence of tuberculosis. In the inspected
municipalities of Geelong, South Gippsland, Ballarat,
Mansfield, Kilmore and Neerim the percentages
affected with tuberculosis for last year were 5.41,
4.45, 2.52, 2.77, 1.99, 1.14. In the Western dis-
trict, where the rich but stodgy landowners live,
the percentages were: Terang, 19,87; Camperdown,
13.36; Warrnambool, 13.15 ; Colac, 12.18. These
four districts boasted 44,517 porkers; the first-
named six only 30,895; and one in every seven of
the uninspected swine was diseased.
“Wottleyav”: In Lilly Buk-stleet (Melbourne)
there are three rival cookshops where you may pur-
chase short soup and chop suey. One has a modest
sign out, “We never close.” Across the road his rival
intimates, “Open all night,” while lower down this
Chinese boulevard Chow 111. has pasted up the
legend, “Me awake always.” A big firm of plumbers
in Bourke-street has a huge sign, “Ideal Heating ’
over a window full of stoves. Next door a humble
sixpenny hash-house has gone one better with a
calico sign, flaunted over a window holding a raw
sirloin of beef and an uncooked apple-pie, bearing
the words, “Ideal Bating.” One hardly looks for
humor either in a plumber or a three-course meal
merchant.
* * * *
“Pneumococcus”: In lots of countries I’ve seen
pneumatic tubes used to blow parcels, packages,
letters, telegrams, etc., from the centre of a big city
to its extremities. The rohrpost has been blowing
through Berlin for 20 years. The system seems to
help the solution of the congested traffic problem.
If small parcels were blown through big tubes in
the Sydney G.P.0., about one-third of the lumber-
ing lorry-vans, carts, barrows and miscellaneous
vehicles could be dispensed with. It is not meant
that you could drop into the G.P.0., pay a penny,
and ask the young lady to blow home a string of
Frankfurts or a crayfish, or a dozen ripe bananas.
She couldn’t even blow your wife home. But modern
life is largely made up of small parcels and letters and
newspapers, which take up more room in the streets
than we think. Every big street is disfigured and
disorganised by furniture vans, carts and lorries
mostly stationary. The pneumatic tube needn’t be
big enough to blow a Chesterfield sofa into the
auction room, but it could deliver odds and ends.
* * * *
The Australian navy will in future be supplied
with oil from local shale. The whole British navy,
the Admiralty has stated, would be propelled by oil
if enough of the fuel could be procured within the
empire. Oil is priceless in warfare, because it is
smokeless. The next best thing is the Welsh smoke-
less coal (so-called). As a fact, it gives out a trace
when the ship is below the horizon. All other coal
is awful. Remember the enormous clouds of smoke
belched by the 16 U.S. battleships, whereby their
proximity was announced when they were still miles
out of sight. The Admiralty has determined to
have some oil vessels in the British navy and some
adapted for either coal or oil.
Dr. Doak, of Mosman (N.S.W.), has in his pos-
session the first post office Savings Bank book issued
in New South Wales. The P. 0.5.8. was established
in 1874, as an adjunct to the Splosh Order office.
Frank W. Hill, son of Dick Hill, of Bent-street,
was figurehead, and A. J. Doak, father of the doctor
above mentioned, was active head as examiner.
Arthur Docker —now in England on pension—teller.
Four per cent, interest was allowed on deposit, and
some days notice had to be given for withdrawals.
OUR ONLY HOPE (PRICE 3d.).
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
After expressing himself in a pessimistic strain
regarding this country’s future, Dr. Rentoul con-
cluded : “Oh, we can save Australia if you will
give adequate maintenance for evangelists, pastors
and teachers for the work of the ministry.”
—Daily paper.
I pray you, brothers, hearken
Unto the doctor’s whoop ;
Although ’tis calculated
To make your spirits droop:
This land is in the soup!
The sin-combating army
Is threatened with a drought;
More coin is needed badly
To put Old Nick to rout —
The “thrums” are giving out!
Prompt action must be taken,
Or sad will be our fate.
One way alone is left us
The ruin to abate—
Seize the collection plate!
If you would save your country
From misery profound,
Disgorge a holy tribute;
Yea. let the “thrums” abound !
Swift pass the plate around!

Ingersoll—the watch with

Do not buy a watch for its pretty case. It is the move-
ment or works that make it keep time. Seven-eighths of the
cost of every Ingersoll goes into the works —to ensure quality
of material and workmanship.
In the cheap showy class, the cost is put into the case,
and little or no consideration is given to the accuracy of the
mechanism.
The only way to make sure that you get an accurate,
reliable cheap watch is to see that the name “ Ingersoll ” is
on the dial of the watch you buy.

writes: —
“It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I
have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by
your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after using tobacco
heavily for seven years, sometimes Boz. to lOoz. in
the week. It is now 12 months since I last used
tobacco, and, although I am continually in the com-
pany of smokers, I do not have the least desire to
smoke, therefore I consider the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizzi-
ness, Nervousness and Stomach Trouble, which I
have every reason to believe were caused through the
use of tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are
only remembered as a hideous nightmare. I eat
and sleep well, and feel fit to face the world again.
It will give me great pleasure to recommend your
remedy to others.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Strong Man’s Agony.
I have given the subject a great deal of thought.
Sometimes my thoughts upon it were so strong that
I felt I ought to retreat from them. But every
time I have considered them in relation to what I
may call the miscellaneous relations sanctioned by
this Bill, 1 have come to the conclusion that those
who have warned the Government to regard this mat-
ter of illegitimate children are in the right.
—Moan from Senator Sledger on the Maternity Bill.
I am, I hope, a tender-hearted man;
I would not, wittingly, harm a dinosaurus !
I’d rather run from Beerslieba to Dan
Than fight! —for, if we’re killed, what
can restore us?
Nothing ! Exactly ! Hence, when called to
face
Some plain, meticulous, legal proposition—
Some little Bill, say, to improve the Race —
I murmur Halt! and study the position.
And then I turn my optics on the Bill,
And think, and think —ah, me! the
strain’s tremendous!
Yet I endure, and by mere force of will
I overcome the fiends who would up-end
us!
Sometimes my thoughts take shape before
my eyes,
So diabolical is my concentration!
As dogs and tigers they materialise,
About to rend the all-unconscious Nation!
Shall I advance (I say), and har their
road? —
Hinder them in their frightful 'work of
slaughter?
Ah, no! I must retreat!.... As ’twere, a
goad
Seems to impel me toward a glass of
water!
Frightful!—the effort’s frightful! Yes; but
see!
Once I arrive at my determination,
And drink, and lave my brow, the monsters
flee
Back to the dark caves of Imagination !
Saved! and I breathe again—the Nation’s
saved!
O God be praised! My thoughts almost
o’ercame me!
Suppose I were too rash —and met, and
braved
The Things?.... A ruined Empire could
scarce blame me!
Perchance, I had been slain! Kind
saints —No, No !
Slain by my own dread thoughts?—oh,
horrid ending!
It must have poured a cataclysm of woe
Upon the heads of those I died defending!
No more! Some pictures are too awfully
dire !... .
Hushed, awed and dumb, I kneel in con-
templation,
After retreat before demoniac ire
Of beasts that would devour a helpless
Nation!
Be this my prayer —that I may never think
Thoughts that would eat the State —if I
should let them —
Ere I can reach my hand out for a drink
And save you all — because I never met
them!

If You Must Walk.
If You must walk in silk attire,
And We in ragged raiment;
If You can live on credit pure,
And We —on ready payment;
If our lass goes in calicoes
While yours can laugh in sables,
Now who would blame if We should claim
A right to turn the tables?
Now some there be who do the work,
And some who do the workers;
And so —if some can do the Shirk,
Why —We can do the Shirkers.
If You can pass your idle days
In fashion gay and courtly,
While We must toil for corn and oil
To fatten up the Portly ;
If Yoit, the Loafing liich, can live
A Life of lazy splendor,
What marvel, then, if Luckless Men
Should call to you, “Surrender !”
How can You marvel if the crowd
From day to day embolden
When you but base your title-deeds
On Grab, the grim and olden?
What wonder when they see the way
Your leadership has brought them
They make a creed —these Sons of Need —
Of what yourselves have taught them !
Now some there be who do the work
And some who do the workers;
And so—li some can do the Shirk,
Why —We can do the Shirkers!

The Pub of Peace.
Over a drink most quarrels melt and enemies
shake hands;
This rule holds good all round the world —
in tame and savage lands;
And though she now and then runs out, and
grieves beneath the stars,
Peace mostly spends her placid days in cool
and shady bars.
The stubborn “barney” re a price, the quar-
rels o’er a lass,
These everyday vexations cease beside a
brimming glass :
And they who came “to have it out ” remain
to yarn and smoke,
And later tell their curious friends, “Oh.
he’s an all-right bloke!”
A meeting in some quiet pub out of the din
and strife
Appears the one sure remedy for all that
vexes life:
It makes good friends of foes—so fill your
glasses to the brim :
Mag dll pood fellows meet with Death , and
hqve a drink with him! >

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. 'To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin/’ is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

MORE ASPECTS OF CONGESTION.
Last week the spirit moved this paper to
draw attention to the fact that the census
of 1901 showed 43 counties out of the 141
which comprise New South Wales to be
losing population. This dying area repre-
sented 110,070 square miles out of the
310,700 which make up the whole State,
so it was no small asset that was being
abandoned and laid waste by the fools who
believe in the Congestion idea .and the
scheme for dragging everything to Sydney.
At the census of 1911 the counties which
were losing population had increased to 53,
and the area they stood for was 127,170
square miles, so the disease was plainly
spreading. Also, the loss of people in the
depopulated area between 1901 and 1911
was nearly three times as great as the loss
between 1891 and 1901. Thus not only was
the trouble expanding over a wider area, but
it was becoming more acute where it had got
, a hold. The loss of 7000 odd people in the
dying regions of the Ma State for the 10
years which ended in 1901 became a loss of
nearly 20,000 during the 10 years which
ended in 1911. Furthermore, the number of
counties which showed an almost impercep-
tible increase—the ones which were appar-
ently about to join in the slither down to
perdition—was distinctly greater in 1911
than in 1901. In order to illustrate the
situation a map is aopended. It shows in
black the area of New South Wales which
is losing population and the area in which
the increase of population is scarcely worth
mentioning. The whole area shown in black
comprises much the greater part of the Ma
State; and the population of that area,
taken as a whole, was less by about 1000
people, in 1911 than in 1901. There were
great losses in some places, and small losses
in others, and in some more localities there
were small gains, but the aggregate result
or consequence was a decrease. The popu-
lation of the State grew on a larger scale
than during any other decade in its history
save the boom period of ISBI-1S91; but the
new folk were crowded into a smaller area
than on any other occasion. In other words,
the Congestion policy reached a sort of
climax, and the curse of the One Bloated
City came home to roost at an earlier hour
than usual. At the same time, there is no
evidence that even worse things may not
be ahead. Every climax is liable to have a
bigger climax following after it.
The depopulation habit shows itself in
other departments of the census return.
THE CONGESTION OR ONE-BLOATED-CITY POLICY OF N.S.W.
The area shown in black had in the aggregate a trifle less population at the census of
1911 than at that of 1901. The white area (and principally the county in which Syd-
ney stands) acquired all the new population which came to the State, and also stole
some from the decaying regions.
Under the head of “Municipalities” appear
152 country places (he., places apart from
Sydney and its suburbs), most of which are
old enough to be included in the census of
1891 or even further back. The census of
1901 showed that 34 of these were dying
out, which is a fairly large proportion out
of 152. In 1911 things were naturally
worse, the Congestion madness having lasted
10 years longer. In that year no less than
57 country municipalities out of the 152
enumerated were on the perishing list. And
they were not all, nor nearly all, towns in
dry or otherwise ill-chosen situations. Many
of them were centres in the most favored
portions of the State, and there is nothing
wrong with them except the policy of drag-
ging everything to Sydney. They include
places like Aberdeen (not far from the neg-
lected harbor of Port Stephens), Berry and
Gerringong and Jamberoo; (on the fertile
South Coast), Bombala(close to the fine har-
bor. of Twofold Bay),-Bathurst, Braidwood,
Carcoar, Deniliquin, Goulburn, Gundagai,
Hill End, Hillgrove, Moania, Moruya,
Nowra, Nyngan, Parkes, Port Macquarie,
Shellharbor, South Shoalhaven, Ulladulla,
Warialda, Yass and other spots that look
like places of fair promise. The last 10
years ought to have been a boom period for
places of promise. The drought broke in
1903, and ever since then seasons have been
good and crops have been good. Also, prices
have varied from fair to excellent. There
was, during the decade 1901-1911, more
alleged political reform and more enthusi-
astic conversation about settling the people
on the land, and breaking up the big estates,
and shifting the great land monopoly, than
happened in any other three decades previ-
ously. But, all the time, the railways, all
pointing to Sydney, were being shoved fur-
ther and further out. The bullock dray
which used to take goods to the outports for
shipment direct to Europe mbved steadily
towards extinction. Tire' roads to the out-
ports became more and -more neglected and
deserted. It probably costs less now to send
wool by train from Monaro to distant Syd-
ney for shipment to Europe than it once did
to send it by dray from Monaro to adjacent
Twofold Bay for shipment to Europe. But
in the old days Twofold Bay was a bullock
or horse dray port competing on equal terms
with bullock or horse dray ports ah over
the world. Now it is a bullock or horse dray
port competing with railway ports all over
the world, and it can’t compete. # It repre-
sents a dead and gone state of things. And
Monaro has changed from being a horse or
bullock dray district, competing with simi-
lar districts all over the world, and blessed
with a port for oversea trade right at its
door, into a railway district competing with
other railway districts all over the world,
but hampered with vast and costly and need-
less distances over congested lines to reach
its outlet —hampered to a degree that makes
its position almost impossible. Monaro is
only quoted as an example. Its story is that
of the State in general, barring a favored
area, mostly in the neighborhood of. the
capital.
Cumberland, in which the N.S.W. capi-
tal city stands, has now rather more than
45S people to the square mile. Northum-
berland, which includes the port and city
and coal mines of Newcastle, has rather less
than 51 people to the square mile. Then
follow Rous (21 people per sq. mile), Cam-
den (191), Cook (16i), and so on. Out of
the 141 counties of N.S.W. only 11 have
more than 10 people to the square mile. So
the county in which Sydney stands has nine
times the density of population of its next
competitor, and about 22 times the density
of the place which ranks third on the list.
Out of the 141 counties there are 58 with
less than one person to the square mile, and
26 with less than one-tenth of a person to
the square mile. Of this last lot 10 are east
of the Darling, and located in what should
be fairly promising country. The popula-
tion of Cumberland has grown from 358
people per square mile in 1891 to
the above-mentioned 458 people per
square mile in 1911. That is to say, the
density of its inhabitants grew by 100 per
square mile inside 10 years. The next great-
est increase was in Northumberland, which
added 10 people per square mile to its popu-
lation. Rous, with an addition of nine per-
sons per mile, came third. The other in-
creases were hardly worth mentioning, and
these two, when compared with the phe-
nomena! growth or bloat of Cumberland,
are hardly worth mentioning either.
The average population of N.S.W. is now
about 54 people to the square mile, so
Cumberland county’s figure (458 people
per square mile, as already set forth
on at least two occasions) is some-
thing heroic in the way of discre-
pancy. In 1901 the district which
contains the inflated Ma State metropolis
had 354 more people to the mile than the
average of the State, while in 1911 it was
ahead of the average to the extent of 453
per mile. Thus the bloating or condensation
policy was plainly going strong between
1901 and 1911. There is only one province
in crowded India which is ahead of Cum-
berland for density, and even that only wins
by a neck or a hair. Cumberland beats the
Indian Empire as a whole by about three to
one, and Scotland and Ireland in about the
same proportion. The United States has
nearly. 80,000,000 people, but Cumberland,
in which N.S.W. makes its grandest effort
at Congestion, is more thickly inhabited
than any one of thefn, save only little
Rhode Island. _ The United States on the
aggregate is six times as crowded as is
N.S.W. in the aggregate, but it hasn’t got
the Congestion disease so badly. The aver-
age population of France is 36 times as
thick as that of N.S.W., yet among its 87.
departments their are only two which are
filled up to the same extent as Cumberland.
China has long been a synonym for suffoca-
tion and lack of elbow room, but among the
18 provinces of the Chow country four —
and no more—get ahead of Cumberland for
close packing of humanity. Outside Austra-
lia, if "he frozen regions are omitted from
consideration as uninhabitable, there is not
a single country which, as a whole,
is so thinly peopled as N.S.W., and
this makes the State’s effort to shove
its men, women and children into one
very small corner all the more wonderful.
*** - *
The. policy of the Ma State (which, by the
way, is also the policy of Victoria) is an
heroic effort to make as much as possible of
the . country—say 994 per cent. —as unin-
habitable as possible; to depreciate the
value of property to the greatest pos-
sible extent in 994 per cent, of the country,
and to shove it so high in 4 per cent, of the
country that it is hardly possible for any
ordinary citizen to pay the rent; and to
make the long, weary railways which all
point to Sydney drag through the largest
possible area of land in which there is the
smallest possible amount of business to be
done. In this last respect considerable suc-
cess has been achieved. In the year before
last the State had 31 non-paying lines —-loss
£276,255. Last year it had 33 of them —
loss £357,145. That was certainly some-
thing of an achievement in a time of high-
class prosperity, but the Congestion policy
does really wonderful achievements at times.
On some of the remote lines, out in the
country that is steadily losing population,
the falling away was remarkable. Thus the
loss on the Goulburn-Cooma section increas-
ed from £35,169 in 1910 to £43,638 in 1911;
that on the Cootamundra-Tumut section from
£11,784 to £23,938; on the Nyngan-Bourke
section from £9665 to £17,400; on the Tam-
worth-Wallangarra section from £24,666 to
£40,641; and on the West Tamworth-Bar-
raba section from £2790 to £5565. These
are old lines —some of them are very old—
which should have profitably '“developed the
country” many, many years ago. But they
haven’t been allowed to develop the coun-
try, the supposed interests of Sydney being
against it. So Sydney absorbs most of the
new population these days. And when a
cottage is vacant at Paddington or Surry
Hills, eight people compete for it by reason
of the over-crowding. And when the eighth
.person gets it through offering the highest
rent, the other seven demand that the .Gov-
ernment shall suppress high rents by Act
of Parliament.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
About Some Ancient Liars at Sydney.
At long last it is proposed to give some
measure of relief to the dead places in the
south-west of N.S.W. They are too far
from Sydney to make it possible that a rail-
way to that city would pay, within any rea-
sonable time, for steam for the whistle; and
it is suggested that the Victorian lines
should be carried a little way across the
b.order, so as to break the monotony of the
corpse. And hereabouts arose one of the
quaintest instances of BuMBLE-mindedness
that even the local records can show. Both
the Sydney Telegraph and Herald were
of opinion that the extensions should be
built on the N.B.W. 4ft. 84in. gauge, instead
of the Victorian sft. 3in., so that all goods
would have to be unloaded and re-loaded, at
vast delay and expense to N.S.W. denizens
of these parts, on the border line. Now the
extensions are expected to be, for a very lung
time, isolated bits of line in N.S.W. They
won’t connect with any place save Mel-
bourne, and there is no visible reason save
meanness and cussedness why the N.S.W.
people who are to use them (if they are ever
built) shouldn’t get a straight, cheap run
to their port. The break of gauge is a long-
standing misfortune, and with it, as with
the Federal capital trouble, and the wreck-
ing of the old common tariff, it was the
arrogance, meanness, and utter faithlessness
of N.S.W. which brought all the loss and
misery about. Australia started railway
building with an agreement to which N.S.W.,
Victoria and S.A. were partners, for a uni-
form 4ft. gauge. Almost immediately
the ancient liars at Sydney broke away, as
usual, changed their gauge to sft. 3in., and
left the other States to follow their lead, or
take the consequences. The other States fol-
lowed reluctantly, and grumbled a good deal
at the bloated insolence of Ma, and the im-
possibility of getting a square, honest deal
out of her. Then N.S.W. rested from
railway building for a time, while Victoria
and S.A. went ahead. And when they had
gone so far that it was hardly possible for
them to turn back, the ancient liars at Syd-
ney reverted to the 4ft. B|in. gauge, and left
its partners the alternatives that they could
either undo the work that was done, and
scrap most of the material they had pur-
chased, or put up with a broken gauge. It
is because of that old piece of gratuitous
wickedness that there is a break between
Sydney and Melbourne to-day, and passen-
gers are hauled out in the cold, grey dawn to
drag their belongings from one carriage to
another. The shattered agreement was kept
by Victoria and S.A. in so far that there is
no break between Melbourne and Adelaide,
which is the only instance in Australia
where there is a clear run by train from one
capital to another. The old arrangement
being dead—-thanks to the ancient iiars at
Sydney—other States presently went off upon
ways of their own, and chaos set in gener-
ally. And how many millions it will cost
to undo the chaos no man knows.
———
Nielsen’s “Expenses.”
The Nielsen case wasn’t improved by the
frank and cheerful announcement made by
the N.S.W. Premier that the wonderful
“Commissioner,” who has gone to the United
States to inquire into nothing tangible that
anybody can discover, has already drawn
nearly £2900 for “expenses.” Nielsen’s
affair looks more objectionable every time it
is inspected. He fell into a state of dis-
agreement with his colleagues. If he voted
against them the Government, in the then
state of its majority, was lost. If he re-
signed his seat (held by a rather small
majority), and an Oppositionist got it, the
Government was lost. If he kept his seat
and didn’t vote at all, the Government might
just be saved. He was sent away to report
on cabbages and kings, or something of the
sort. His absurd remuneration was called
“expenses”; if it had been called “salary”
his seat would have been forfeited, and an
Oppositionist might have got it. Thus he
was able to collect his Parliamentary salary
along with his “expenses,” and the lot seems,
so far as things have gone, to represent over
£3OOO a year. Of coxlrse, if Nielsen stayed
away for a whole session, his seat would
become vacant, and the election might end
in the return of an Oppositionist, and things
would be unpleasant all round. But Niel-
sen came back suddenly, with his blushing
“expenses” thick upon him; showed himself
in the House; saved his seat and his Par-
liamentary salary ; and fled away, so secretly
that his name didn’t even appear on the
passenger list, to earn more “expenses.” It
is admitted that he has the offer of a billet
at a very respectable salary as a Commis-
sioner of some sort somewhere or another—
though th 4 State of N.S.W. doesn’t seem
to urgently, require more Commissioners of
one sort or another; and if he accepts it
when he is no longer required to hold the fort
at Yass, he will, presumably, be fixed up
for quite a while. Meanwhile, he or his
secretary send back scraps of information
in return for all the “expenses” such as (1)
that he met Percy Hunter; (2) that the
price of meat is rising in. the U.S. ; (3)
that the Kanaka of Hawaii is a cheap toiler.
The fact that not one Labonte m Parlia-
ment has revolted against this business has
almost certainly done the party more harm
than anything else that ever happened to it.

Bogus Outrage, Perjury, etc., in a New
Place.
This country is used to the girl-child who,
having been smacked or otherwise pun-
ished swears an information against her
male corrector, and tries to get him hanged
or at least gaoled. Also, it is accustomed to
the serving-maid who varies, the monotony
of life below-stairs by lashing herself in-
securely to a bedpost and stating that a
malignant in a mask has done the deed, and
has submitted her to unspeakable indignities.
And then there is the suburban female who
is pursued tirelessly by a licentious, but
futile, malefactor, through 27 ill-lighted and
unpoliced streets; and the young woman
who claims to have been caught by the usua
peripatetic outlaw and bounded on and
robbed of the contents of her peggy-bag. And
there are many others But Melbourne
evolved a type last week that was <M er ent
from all the above. She was n 9 t m the
Marianne line of business —a calling which
makes for the reading of sensational litera-
ture, and, as an upshot, an unhinged mind
nor was she immature and flighty, or a vague
wanderer in unfrequented byways. She was
merely a 24-year-old shop assistant who was
detected stealing lollies. Her employer
sheeted the offence home to her, and let her
off with a caution. Instead of going on
her way rejoicing, she allowed the .attair to
rankle, and next morning she weighed in
with a fairly convincing yarn which, it it
had only been a shade more skilfully con-
cocted, and had been believed m . Court,
would have blasted for ever the social and
home life of the man who had objected to
her thieving from him. I ortunately, the
iury, in an unwonted spasm of common-
sense, disbelieved her utterly. After their ver-
dict, the Judge said :
The matter ought to be taken further. If the evi-
dence of defendant and his witnesses were correct, a
monstrous charge had been made against a reputable
man, who, according to the girl’s evidence, was ab-
solutely unfit to have control of any person rn bis
employment. As far as the verdict of the jury was
concerned, he quite agreed with it. The police should
take the matter up and have the girl prosecuted tor
perjury.
If one can take any sort of a line by past
form, the matter will not, however, go any
further. For some insoluble reason, it
hardly ever does in these cases. Yet here,
perjury has been committed unless the jury
aforesaid was hopelessly wrong—in the
attempt to do a most hideous injustice, a
crime far more serious to society and to the
person involved than 20 robberies. I he
offence of accusing someone of something
that is as difficult of disproof as it is ot
proof is a particularly safe one. And it is
just this class of offence that the Law usu-
ally jumps on hardest —and rightly so. It
is equally pernicious from the public, stand-
point, whether it arises from a desire tor
revenge or from a wish to escape pun-
ishment. And, finally, it is a crime that
tends to find herds of imitators. From every
possible point of view it requires to be
assailed with all the energy that the Haw
possesses. Alack that the odds should be
1000 to three, or thereabouts, against any-
thing of the sort happening. The girl who
attempted to steal, and, that, failing, made a
spirited assault on her victim s moral cha-
racter, will almost certainly go unassailed.
And, noting this, other girls similarly situ-
ated and of a similar type, will do likewise.
A fresh school of these blackmailing wenches
will be instituted —or, rather, a new class
will be added to the old and flourishing
school that has existed for so long. Which
will be a pity, seeing that it is all in the in-
terests of Law and Order that every fresh
development of the sort should be scotched.
Some Bessons from Mount By ell.
As this paper goes to press the worst is
known concerning the Mount Lyell horror.
The fire is all but out in the mine and be-
tween 40 and 50 coffins are awaiting the
bodies of those whom it was not possible to
save. The catastrophe is rendered more appal-
ling and heartrending, in a sense, by the dim
suspicion that, but for a touch of careless-
ness somewhere, it might have been averted.
Were the mine officials acquainted by tele-
phone as early as a quarter to 11 with the
fact that a serious fire had broken out.
And. if so, did they chance things, and omit
to instantly lift the shift? Was there only
one man to attend to two pu m phouse en-
gines on two different levels. And would
a system under which neither engine was
ever left untended and unwatched tor a
moment have obviated the spread of the con-
flagration? These -problems are agitating
the public mind just now, but what, basis
they have in fact will not be known till the
Commission which has been appointed by
the Tasmanian Government reports upon
the matter. There is a certain amount ot
dreary satisfaction to be got from the con-
sideration that the more the details ot the
hideous business have been ventilated, the
more the priceless quality of the white man s
courage and sense of duty have been estab-
lished. The writer once heard a Russian
officer, who had fought through the _Russ-
Jap war, expatiate on the uncanny daunt-
lessness of the Japanese. He argued that
their courage was superior to that ot the
white man, inasmuch as both privates and
officers were cheerfully willing to take part,
not in “forlorn hope” expeditions merely,
but in expeditions in which there was no
earthly possibility of any. of the party re-
turning alive. And he instanced a case,
during the operations outside Port Arthur,
where a whole regiment voluntered for a
sortie, in which 15 men only were required,
the job being to get as near the Russian
position as possible, signalling the results ot
their observations the while. In this case
it was certain that the whole band would
perish, and he contended that the modern
civilised Caucasian would not take on such
a contract. Jack Bolton, the 24-year-old
miner whose body was taken out of the
mine on. Friday, did better than this. He
worked, untiringly, helping his dazed mates
to the cage that was to carry them to
safety. At the last, as he was about to take
his place, a married man appeared. Bolton
was unmarried: he stepped, out of the cage,
pushed the family man in, and walked
serenely to a particularly awful death.
There were no strains of martial music,
no shouting comrades, no waving, pennons,
no enemies overcome with admiration m
spite of themselves, to hearten and cheer
him on. Just darkness and silence and loneli-
ness, and blinding, choking smoke, and the
ever-present expectation of the deadly gust
of monoxide gas, which ultimately came
along. And Bolton, be it remembered, to
the everlasting credit of the white mm ,
was but one of many. A race is m a good
way so long as its working men, meie
youths many of them, persons of no fixed
abode .perhaps, and with few friends
folks, ’in short, who have infnntesimally
little to lose by showing the white feather
and saving their skins—rise thus splendully
to a dreadful occasion. Australia can do
nothing for these epic dead men. But at
least it can see that those ft ey ,7® lift
behind are provided for, and it can use the
horrible example of their And
avert similar tragedies in the future. And
these things it is up to it to do in the most
speedy and thorough fashion possible.
Advice to Manslayers.
An Adelaide man lias been sent into seclu-
sion for seven years for a blow which re-
sulted fatally. It seems a savage sentence,
especially as, at the same Criminal Sittings,
a fatal gunshot, fired apparently by inten-
tion, though in drink and under provoca-
tion, brought the shooter only five years.
But the man knocked down and out was a
husband, and the striker was shown to have
been too intimate with his wife before, and
to have been actually living with her since ;
and it is likely that this had something to
do with the severity of the young and
austere Judge Murray. Also, the accused
made the great mistake of saying that it
was not his doing. It is not quite certain
even now, for the scuffle took place in the
dark outside a pub. But the accused was
shown to have been close at hand. There
was the known cause of. trouble between
the two men, and the negative evidence ot
the wife —who was present —was simply
disbelieved by the jury. After that, the
prisoner’s Cake was Dough, as Shaksfeake
puts it. The chance of the defence being
believed seems to have been hardly worth
the extra risk —accepting the verdict as
correct. But the homicide practitioner
almost ’always loses his head. This paper
has previously had occasion to remark that
no other skilled profession—except mater-
nity—is embarked on with such lack of fore-
thought or training. And it now advises
all and any of its readers who have the
misfortune to kill a man, or a woman —in
anger, or in liquor, or by any misadven-
ture short of deliberate murder —to run
straight for the nearest policeman. Tell
him it was accident, or a fair fight, 01 the
unforeseen result of a scuffle, or a blow
struck under intolerable provocation. (.As,
for instance, in the present case. We were
all a bit muddled with drink. And he slung
off at me about his wife, and wanted to
fight. And I passed him just one, and the
fall did the damage. And a man with a
skull as thin as all that ought not to be
allowed about in pubs.”) In fact, go con-
trary to the natural impulse, and tell the
Truth —or thereabouts. -A. clevei
will see to the rest. But don’t say that you
were not present, or that the deed was done
by a mysterious stranger whom nobody saw
before or since; for there are sure to be
sundry facts, that in your excitement you
overlooked, which will prove you a liar, and
then you will get a long sentence, or worse.
And, above all things, don’t bolt; tor then
the man-hunting instinct of the community
—and of the newspapers —will be aroused,
and you will certainly be hanged when
caught. It is not a nice thing to kill a
man, and it is not nice to get even a short
term of prison for doing it | but that, should
bp welcome by contrast with the obvious
alternatives. In three words, the (non-
deliberate) manslayer should Play for
Safety. Or, to put it in other words, he
should never leave the red ball over the
pocket.

The Vanishment of an Illusion.
E W. Knox, general manager of the
C.S.R., let at least one cat out of the basket
last week while undergoing examination be-
fore the Royal Commission on Sugar, at
Sydney. On May 1, 1912, Knox, in an
endeavor to save the Commission s time or
something, appeared on the scene with a
long statement on paper which purported to
explain all that was necessary, or, anyhow,
all the co. thought was necessary, ot its
position. The Commission, however, opined
that it wasn’t having any prepared state-
ment just then, and would conduct the job or
obtaining information in its own way. -Next
morning the press of Australia, or a fair
share of it, blossomed forth with the vast,
unwieldy epistle under a covering letter
thus.
The following statement was tendered to the Com-
mission to-day, and its acceptance refused by the
Chairman, but, as it contains matter of public in-
terest, I should be glad if you will publish it in
your next issue.
To the unenlightened public it appeared (1)
that the co. bad suffered an injustice at the
hands of the Commission, and was practi-
cally driven to assert, in the newspapers, its
innocence of long-standing and unpleasant
charges; (2) that the newspapers bad main-
tained the best traditions of the press by
throwing open pages of space to an unfor-
tunate litigant, suffering at the hands of a
prejudiced tribunal, in order that the truth
of his case might be placed before a just
world. Alas, that such holy sentiments
should have been born in vain. One of the
Commissioners put the matter to Knox this
way, last Thursday :
If it ("the statement) were published because:
Commission refused it on May 1, it could haiuly
have reached Adelaide in time to have been pub-
lished on May 2.
And right there the feline made one tre-
mendous leap from the old bag: —
Knox : I may explain that we sent the statement
round to our managers before tendering it here. Our
idea was, if it were not accepted, we would publish .
it, so we gave it to them in advance.
Commissioner Anderson: As a matter oi tact, then,
publication of it was arranged for before the Com-
mission saw it?
Knox: I think that is true, with limitations
That statement was ready last December, but we
had no opportunity of putting it forward till May.
Anderson : It was evidently decided some days or
weeks before May 1 to publish it in the newspapers.
Knox: It was decided months before.
Sadder still, the statement was not pub- .
lished for the benefit of a downtrodden and
oppressed co., but iu consideration ot meie
sordid cash for the benefit of the news-
papers’ annual div. Knox would not say
what amount the co. separated from itselt,
his reason being that he “was not going to
give the newspapers away.” Thus our illu-
sions vanish one by one, and life becomes
merely an opportunity for discovering that
things are not what they seem.
The Cheap Editor.
Some of these trade union papers seem to
be even worse employers than the lriyate
Enterprise rags. The Writers and Artists
Union recently moved the N.S.W. State In-
dustrial Court to appoint a Board to inquire
into the wages and working conditions ot
writers and artists on the Sydney press.
Most, if not all, of the larger Sydney papers
are already working under an agreement
with the Australian Journalists Association,
a Commonwealth organisation registered under
Federal law. And other papers, not working-
under agreement with that body, have
some sort of agreement with their employees.
But there seems to be in Sydney a sort of
fringe of papers —some of them trades-union
pubfications—the staffs of which have not
any agreement at all, and these staffs appear
to require protection of some sort. At the
first meeting of the Board one witness gave
evidence that he was sub-editor of the
Co-operator. His salary was 15 per week,
and the claimant union asked that he_ be
paid £8 per week. If the story he told is
correct, £8 is not one penny too much. He
explained that he wrote, on an average, 10
columns of original matter every week, and,
in addition, had to read proofs of the Whole
paper for libel and printers’ errors; that lie
had to sub-edit a number of pages of matter,
and that sub-editing in his case was largely
a matter of re-writing. In addition, he had
to arrange the make-up of the paper, and
sort out the various items which compose
the whole rag in the order in which they had
to be printed; besides all of which he did a
certain amount of reporting and a few other
trifles —thi Sj as already mentioned, tor to a
week The Co-operator, upon investiga-
tion, turns, out to be an eight-page broad-
sheet, nominally edited by J. H- Uatts,
M H R., who is mostly away m Melbourne,
and can’t edit; and it is run mostly m the
interests of certain unions'connected with the
railway and tramway services. Each of its eight
pages consist of eight columns, giving 64
columns to the paper. The. columns are 2d
inches in length, and contain roughly, 207
lines. So this unfortunate sub-editor starts
his weekly task by writing about 6iyds. ol
bright, original matter! In short, he gets
10s a column for mighty long columns,
and if there is a Tory paper m Syd-
ney which doesn’t pay twice or three times
that amount, this writer hasn t heard of it.
And then the unfortunate slave, after being
paid less than half rates for his writings,
practically edits the paper gratis. Are tne
Co-operator people ashamed oi themselves
or are they not?

“Beet” writes re sugar problems: ■
The difficulty of arriving at the profits of the
Colonial Sugar Refining Co. was made as appaient
as the butt end of an elephant last Thursday, when 1
General-Manager Knox was on the witness stand ot
the Sugar Commission, sitting at Sydney. Commis-
sioner Anderson figured that the 1911 profits in:
Australia amounted to at least £430,000, and in
Maoriland and Fiji to £345,000, or a total of
£775 000. Having arrived at these figures, Ander-
son asked Knox if they were correct. The General.
Manager, however, was not wildly anxious to practise
arithmetic. “I will not know until next week, he
replied, “what the profits were for last year, so I do
not see how you know.” Knox admitted that 1911
was an exceptional year, and that what the co. made
per ton of cane was probably very much more than
for the five previous years. Anderson interjected
that if the co. couldn’t bring itself to pouch the
profits in excess of £775,000 on the year s transac-
tions, he would be prepared to struggle with them
himself. According to the Commissioners calcula-
tion, on the capital of £2,375,000, actually paid up,
there was a return of 32.63, or £32 12s. 7d. per
cent, per annum, and on the stated capital ot
£3,000,000 the return was 25.83, or £25 16s. per
cent, per annum. Knox replied that, on the actual
figures, the return -was 10 per cent., that the divi-
dend paid last half-year was at the .rate of lb per
cent per annum; that the exact profits could be
ascertained by studying the statement published by
the co. in the Australian papers last May; and that,
if they couldn’t be so ascertained, it didn t matter
anyhow, because, as a matter of fact, the co. did not
want to tell the public what profits it was making.
Finally, the co.’s Genera]. Manager was asked if he
would look at the item, “liabilitv sundry creators
and suspense accounts, £903,278, m the balance
sheet for the year ended March 31, 1912, and say
what proportion was due to creditors; and the
General Manager of the co., with natural modesty,
replied that he was afraid not. So the Royal Com-
mission can do no more than believe that its earlier
suspicions are correct, or thereabouts.

“Ivai Kai” with a speaking trumpet :
The Victorian Royal Commission on life-saving
appliances and methods in connection with terry ser-
vices has been hearing evidence m Sydney. _ That is
to say, it has been hearing evidence of a kind, such
as (1) unlimited praise on the part of various har-
bor officials of the manner the several cos. conduct
their services ; (2) unstinted admiration from officials
of the cos. as to the way the harbor officials control
the water traffic. Haven’t noticed that any mention
was made of the fact that, frequently, passengers
have to shell out Bd. for a return ticket to Manly
when there is no seating accommodation for them.
Likewise, the Commissioners were not even given a
hint that when a Sydney ferry is packed like a tin
of sardines, it is still 25 per cent, short of its
licensed carrying capacity.. One harbor official of
great tonnage expressed his opinion that the only
real danger a ferry steamer was exposed to was that
it might come into collision with a big ocean-going
steamer, when it would, of course, be rolled over
like a log. Still, the official remarked, this wouldn t
matter much, as assistance would always be avail-
able within 10 minutes or so. Anybody knows liow
easy it would be in the circs, to stand on ones
head under water when unable to escape from the
glass coop, styled by the Sydney Ferries Co. the
upper deck. No doubt some unscrupulous persons:
would be drowned, for petty spite and selfishness:
are, unfortunately, too common in this world. In:
fact, considering their prevalence, it is little less,
than a miracle that struggling cos. are able to pay to
their lone widow, shareholders a paltry 20 per cent
or thereabouts.
“Button Stick”: Both “Machete” and
“Bromide” seem to me to be on the wrong
cycle track in their arguments about the
war bike (B. 3/10/T2). One says that if
a bikist is charged by a moke-mounted
'trooper he and his bike would have spots
and spokes knocked olf. The other retorts
that the bikist could wheel off the map before
the charge arrived. And “Bromide” now
remarks that no bike could be spurred for
life through Barcoo scrub, Balonne belar,
or tussocky country, without the horseman
ambling up and sticking holes in the -bolting
biker. Now “Machete” may remark that
the bike will refuse to enter the ring if
it’s in Barcoo, etc., country, and “B.” may
repartee or back-talk to the effect that tie
won’t be asked, and so on and so off. But
isn’t all this rather beside the point? Surely
the bike isn’t suggested as a ' firing-line
fighter. Its chief object in life will be (as

A Vision of Boot.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In short, the present N.S.W. Government appears
to have convinced itself that, so long as it calls itself
“Labor,” it can do almost anything wiftimpunrty.
Now and then this matter is put before the slov-
enly easy-going Fisi-iee Government, and it replies,
in a dull, emotionless fashion, that it doesn t pro-
pose to interfere with the tariff.’’-The Bulletin.
Behind his whiskers Labor stood,
His bowyangs on his knees,
Although they told him things were good
The message could not please;
He drew what looked a decent wage,
And worked six days a week,
Yet something like a growing rage
Flushed all liis hairy cheek.
He saw a band of sleek, keen men
Who wore his badge and name,
With wagging tongue and easy pen
Sell all his hopes to shame;
A wreck of broken pledges strewed
The hearthrug of the State,
The platform which his hands had hewed
Burned piecemeal in the grate.
He saw them pledge his home and kids
For cash to boost the land,
And gather millions' from the Yids
With large and grasping hand ;
xlnd he remembered how, in grin:.
Past days, when hope was small,
The promise these had given him
To float no loans at all.
He saw them gaily circle round
A fine vice-regal hat,
And with a meek, adoring sound
Join in the Prayers of Fat;
And he remembered how they swore,
If once to office raised,
To boot from out the public door
The shams that now they praised.
The Legislative Council’s calm
Disturbed him like small flies,
Or wind-blown dust that sought to cram
Loose landscape in his eyes.
That useless, dull and hopeless curse
That he had vowed to end
His trusted leaders sought to nurse
With care like some sick friend.
He looked around. The ports were locked,
Slow railways still dragged down
By narrow pathways, all but blocked,
Scant trucks to one grey town.
All he had hoped for stayed undone,
And all the weary while •
In Labor’s name black treason won
The Sydney landlord’s smile.
I saw strong Labor hitch his pants
And turn away his head.
“I hold,” he said, “these biting ants
Are somewhat worse than dead.
Ho. let me turn from craft and stealth
With open eyes to view
The work that for the Commonwealth
tier loyal leaders do!”
1-Ie looked. He paused. He swore a steep,
Large oath, as bushmen may.
“Odds crocodiles, they’ve gone to sleep!
Was what I heard him say.
“The tariff door is open wide,
I set them there to ward,
The nig and Chow from o’er the tide
Have broken down our guard.
“The sweater’s goods come pouring in,
They rest and let them pass
As readily as smiling sin
Trips o’er the summer grass.
Ho, sleeping fools!”—he raised his voice—
“ Back to your work! Be quick.
Nay, take your sleep, or take ,your choice,
My soul is roused to kick !”
Behind his whiskers Labor stood,
His bowyangs on his knees,
All fierce and angry was his mood,
And naught was there to please.
The nation’s chiefs were, snoring loud,
State insects stored their loot,
And no one marked the coming proud,
Vast sweep of Labor's boot.

a much greater distance in less time than

the good road country, but the rails might

10,000 men to get, say, 50 miles down the
line from Sydney, and have a fight com-
fortably or uncomfortably finished before the
troop-trains had cleared the bottle-neck.
Besides which, the rails would be strained
to the limit to carry the cartridges and

The Things that Connor, M.L.C., Doesn’t
Know.
Some, few davs ago, Frank Connor, of
WeStralia, M.L.C., and cattle monarch, was
interviewed by the S. M. Herald. He was
asked whether any emissaries of the U.S.
Beef Trust had been up his way (Kim-
berley, W.A.) :■ —-
“Yes, one of them came about two years ago,”
he replied. “He investigated the position very tuor-
oughly, and must have reported against starting
operations, because we never heard any more about
it. My own impression is that if this so-called trust
established itself here it would be quite a good
thing: Increased competition would be an advan-
tage 'to the grower, and I can’t see that it would
hurt anybody.”
It is plain from the foregoing that there are
things which even the most successful of
bullock emperors is unacquainted with. Two
years ago, the electors hadn’t been bam-|
boozled into voting “No” to the Referendum
questions. It seemed fairly likely that they
would so vote as to give Parliament power
to make laws in respect of “foreign corpora-
tions and trading and financial corporations
formed within the limits of the Com-
monwealth.” Of course, the framers of the
Constitution and the people of Australia
intended Parliament to have that power.
However, the High Court laid it down that
all the Australian Parliament was compe-
tent to do was, under certain peculiar cir-
cumstances, to prohibit a corporation from
starting business. The Beef Trust emissary
would have been a most blighted type of
imbecile had he squandered his employers’
money by starting operations before he knew
which way the electoral cat was going to
leap. Since he visited Kimberley, those
things have happened which he and his
Trust would have most desired. The fool-
public has voted in such a way as to keep
the National Parliament impotent as re-
gards the control of monopolies, injurious or
otherwise. And the High Court has decided
that monopolies or trusts are not injurious
institutions, anyhow, so long as they do no
more than raise prices against the consumer,
provide short supplies and inferior goods,
and lay themselves out to ruin competitors.
In fact, so long as a Trust confines itself to
activities of this description, it is, in the eyes
of the Court, a “laudable” institution, and
one that merits every encouragement. So
the Beef Trust emissary has come back.
Connor, M.L.C., hasn’t heard about him,
seemingly; yet here he is, and in Banana-
land there are tangible proofs that his con-
cern has started operations in the form of
a vast meat-exporting co., the shares of
which are nominally held by a number of
local clerklings. Mr. Connor thinks that
“if the so-called Trust established itself
here” (he is referring to the Trust, which is
already with us), it would be a good thing.
Also, he is unable to see that it would hurt
anybody. Yet he would probably call hiiii-
self a pro-Britisher, if not an Imperialist.
As this paper has remarked frequently
before, the establishment of the U.S. Beef
Trust in Australia constitutes the most stu-
pendous menace imaginable to the half-
starved inhabitants of Britain. The very
lives of many of them depend on cheap food.
Up to date, the Beef Trust has full control
of all the great meat-exporting countries
with the exception of Australia and Maori-
land. Let them once collar Australasia and
the British meat market is theirs. The Trust
bosses will be able to fix the price of meat
daily in London. And Connor, M.L.C., and
Cattle King, can’t “see that this would
hurt anybody”! Judging by his statement
that he personally met a Beef Trust emis-
sary, Connor obviously doesn’t even know
the elementary fact that there is no such
thing as a Beef Trust anywhere. He doesn’t
know that only last month, one Malkow,
of America, proved, amid deafening cheers
from the Liberal press of the Common-
wealth, that the whole of the talk about
there being a Meat Trust in America was
Socialistic humbug—the reckless lying of
the revolutionary and the demagogue.
Malkow offered, if the papers would but
give him a month or so to look round, to
. prove, by legal documents, affidavits, U*.S.
. Supreme Court records, title deeds, the rules
.of draw-poker and the by-laws of the Ohio
Happy Despatch Railroad Co. that, what-
. ever the position might be in reference to
other countries, there was not, never had
nnd could not possibly be a Meat,
Beef, Chop, Kidney, Sausage or even Leg
of Mutton Trust in any part of the land
which flies the proud standard of the Wooden
Eagle or Canned Remains or whatever it is.
Yet to Connor, seemingly, though he is in
the business himself, the whole splendid and
convincing uproar was as the mendacious
voice of a commercial traveller blithering in
the. wilderness.

There will be two more opportunities of
witnessing the miracles of Jansen at the
Palace (Sydney). Many of these miracles
would put some of the ancient jugglers who
became Christians right out of the business;
in fact, this writer recollects only one
miracle-worker of greater prominence. That

TURNING ,” AT THE ADELPHI.

was Heres, who descended into Hell, and
remained there 15 days, two hours and some
odd minutes. Jansen’s season closes on Fri-
day, and on Saturday the Palace will be
illuminated by “The Un-
seen Eye,” which Ran-
dolph Bedford has con-
structed. The play is
advertised as “brilli-
antly clever, with a plot
of absorbing interest, full
of intensely dramatic
situations, affording that
brilliant actress, Madge
Mclntosh, full scope for
her undoubted genius in
plays of this character.”
(Here Mr. Bedford leads
Miss Mclntosh forward.
Both bow profoundly.)
Taking warning from the tightness of the
local money market, J. Rufus Wallingford
has decided to move to Melbourne for Lup
week, and the last chance investors have to
get shares in his company at Sydney Cri-
terion will be on October 31.
A series of pictures, representing scenes in
Montenegro —of special interest just now,
because the aged King and his little army
are out smiting the Unspeakable hard on the
fez —are screened at the Crystal Palace.
They give one the impression that, if the
scenes shown therein are from the average
Montenigger village, a few hundred shells
and a large quantity of gunpowder would be
the best things they could possibly have.
“Williams’s Weekly,” of local events,. and
“Dearly Bought Friendship,” a military
drama, were two other notable features.
“The Sign of the Cross” picture, which was
alleged to have been taken to China for
missionary purposes, having converted all
the Chinese it is ever likely to, has been re-
turned to the Crystal Palace, Part
“The Girl Who Took the Wrong Turning”
wishes to assure her Sydney friends that she
is progressing favorably, and, traffic per-
mitting, will continue to wander from the
Path of Righteousness until further notice.
And George Marlow, feeling his purse grow-
ing heavier, announces that he is in no hurry
to turn her out or show her the error of her
ways; in which case she will be permitted
to reside at the Adelphi for another week or
so. Then it will doubtless be some other
innocent girl’s turn to be led astray.

Miss Margo, of the French accent, now
pouring variegated alcoholic drinks out of a
glass jug at Sydney Tivoli, presents the
most attractive summer turn imaginable so
far as it goes, that is. The thirsty patron ot
the house is advised not to go either to the
amphitheatre or circle, but to book a front
seat in the stalls, where the tray of super-
natural refreshment is handed round. The
brisk and chirpful mystifier excuses herself
from shouting for those upstairs by pointing
out that she wants to dodge a possible charge
of changing the tray by keeping it in full
view of the audience. But are there no
ropes in the Tivoli for the drinks to come up
by, or stairs for the drinkers to go down?
D’Arc’s marionettes, all of them finished
models of star music-hall people, are more
interesting than the usual turn of the kind.
The diminutive Will Whitburn is a fairly
good imitation of a well-known Melbourne
comedian, and the small Harry Lauder seems
to reflect the genial personality of the Scotch
specialist. Nella Webb, juggler Mozzetto,
tenor Marini, Tom Dawsop and Welch and
Carbasse are the other leading inhabitants
of the bill.

“Dorothy” is in its last week at Sydney
Royal. Meanwhile, business, where it is not

Ward and Vere are appearing in a more
or less humorous sketch at the National
Amphitheatre. Furthermore, Athos and
Read are doing weird things on skates, and
the Waldrons are causing catastrophes to
happen to one another by means of furious
personal violence. The populace love such
deeds, and what with them, and old friends
like the Driscolls, Billy Watson and Florrie
Ranger, the Amphitheatre is managing to
ride triumphantly on the flood tide of success
which leads on to a bloated credit balance.

The Marlow co. has finished its season at
Adelaide Royal with “Brought to Ruin,” a
worthless play. The management truthfully
advertised its “brilliant
company of artists,” and

Buckler and other tho-
roughbreds between the
shafts of a dray—so to
speak. Desmond and
Beatty, Miss Spong and
Miss Temple have now
come in with “Jimmy
Valentine” on the Wil-
liamSonian circuit. The
Schenck brothers have
started putting their
heads together at the
Tivoli, giving just the added touch of
thrill that ah otherwise strong bill
lacked. At the King’s are Victor the ven-
triloquist, Maude Courtney and the story-
telling “Mr. G.,” also the whole Corrick
family—an entertainment in themselves.

that summer is coming. The Exhibition has
varied from Kirkby Lunn—in the doctors’
hands part of the time—to an ambulance

Although the bouquet of “Florodora” is
not now so intoxicating as when first un-
corked, at the beginning of the century, it
has not entirely lost its allurement, and the
reception accorded the revival at Melbourne
Her Majesty’s has been such as to cause the
"combine’s” bump of amiability to stand out
like a water-melon. The pretty maidens are
not quite so fatally beautiful as some of their
predecessors, several of whom are now at
home in the gilded mansions of the affluent;
and the preseffi Tweedlepunch does not land
so often upon,. th 6 audience’s funny-bone as
did Lauri in days of yore. But Miss Palotta
is as charming and unmusical in this year
of grace as ever she was, and the show is
richer by an Ivy Schilling than it was before,
so it is a bob to the good. Miss Blanche
Browne (Dolores) was out of the cast for a
couple of nights last week, and the Laziest
Girl in Florodora (a place where nobody
seems to work hard, except the chief come-
dian) was played by Miss Nellie Wilson.
She used her passable mezzo with satisfac-
tory results, but did not always remember
to forget the alleged French accent which
she had to graft on to the characters she has
been playing for the last couple of years.
“Florodora” will depart before the end of
next week, and on Derby night “Nightbirds”
will proceed to build a nest capable of accom-
modating the managerial shekels until the
arrival of the panto.

“A Romance in Ireland,” another play in
which the greenness of the brogue is calcu-
lated to deceive the artistic eye of the un-
sophisticated patriot, was served up at
Melbourne Princess’s on Saturday, for the
delectation of an audience which was more
noisy than numerous. The romance is pro-
vided by Allen Doone conceiving an affection
for a swate colleen, and making a nocturnal
entry to her bedroom, with the most innocent
of motives. Unfortunately, he is surprised
by the ladv’s brother, whose mind is cast in
a suspicious mould, and the two gentlemen
go through a most willing mill on the floor,
for the honor of swate Norah and the glowry
of dear ould Ireland. If the rest of the play
was as lively as this incident, it would be
less liable to provoke the hollow cough which
denotes the wandering mind, and perhaps the
mind would be less inclined to stray if
Mishter Doone did not insist upon weening
over the grave of his dear old mother at in-
ordinate length. However, speaking gener-
ally, this writer would as lief hear Mr. Doone
weep as hear him sing, and if he wasn’t
doing the one he might possibly resort to the
other, so this paper will content itself by
merely lodging its protest against the grave-
yard scene, in the hope that it will be dis-
regarded. To-morrow (Friday) Mr. Doone
concludes a season rich in shamrocks and
shekels, and on Saturday George Marlow will
rush in where, for the past five weeks, the
local Orangeman has feared to tread. “Sins
of Society” is the captivating title of the
forthcoming production, and the democracy is
invited to come and learn how to misbehave,
by watching its betters hasten to the Devil.

The Prahran Lyric (Vic.) is subject to
periodical attacks of Dickensitis, _ and it had
another bout last week, when it put up
“Nicholas Nickleby” for an abbreviated spin.
The film was unwound in two acts and 71
scenes, and was doggedly pursued by the re-
marks of the lecturer. “Black . Sheep was
the name of a film which insisted on the de-
generative effects of beer and cards, and “The
Narrow Road” was a subject similar in
moral, and almost as pleasant and tidy in
plot.

Wirths’ contingent of human and beast
wonders maintains a strong hold on Mel-
bourne’s attention. Hillary. Long, the head-
balancer, remains the champion of the lot, his
art of absorbing liquor upside down being
especially appreciated by the Religious Edi-
tor, who says he never saw anybody drinking
up before. Equally wise and suggestive re-
marks might be made about the bears who
moisten themselves like commercial travellers
and waddle about like capitalists ; and much
language could be spilt about the loud and
distracting brass band. As regards the
clowns and elephants, conversation can be
cut off with the statement, that those ancient
features are still much akin. The elephants
are noted for their generous hide, and when
on hears the jests of the clowns, one assumes
they have elephants among their relations.

According to all accounts, Elizabeth of
England was an amorous lady, chiefly noted
for her shocking temper, and Mrs. Bernhardt,
who enacts poor Liz in the latest concoction
at West’s Palace, Melbourne, presents her
with the attributes that History gave her.
Sarah’s Elizabeth is at all times a likely per-
sonage, forceful enough and royal enough
when royalty at Sarah’s age means a dash ot
embonpoint and theatricality. The actress
is convincingly supported by her own
special company, particular credit being due
to the Earl of Essex of Mr. Lou Telßgen,
the party who was married to Mrs. Bern-
hardt by Mrs. Rumor, and was subsequently
divorced by Common Report. Tucked among
West’s other features is “The Girl at the
Key,” a Yankee tale of Wall-street finance.
** * *
The revival of “The Whip,” at Melbourne
Royal, is a caution to those quidnuncs who
complained that the imported co. of two
years back could have been easily
by a scratch team picked from the I irm s?-
local resources. As a matter of fact, the
newcomers who played “The. Whip at Her
Majesty’s were not a very bright lot, ana in
subsequent tests most of them showed their
shortcomings. But in the drama they were
specially engaged for, they looked their parts,
and spoke their lines accordingly, and with
one or two exceptions, acted well enough. A
hollow, spectacular melodrama isn’t a
medium for subtle characterisation or fine
emotional mummery, anyhow. Well, the no.
at the Royal includes Eric Maxon, Miss Dix,
George Miller, Atliolwood and Leslie Victor,
and the general effect is more flagrantly
artificial than it was before, although the
railway accident and the horse race are more
vigorously interpreted on the- bigger stage.

The quite satisfactory members of the pre-
sent crowd are Eardley Turner, as the noble
Marquis who has such a terrible “derry” on
touts; Miss Susie Vaughan, as the broad-
comedy widow; and Miss Gwen Burroughs
and A. J. Patrick, as the red-haired vil-
lainess and her colleague in crime. Also,
Leonard Willey acts the part of the young
parson reasonably, whereas the curate in the
original production was a beauteous ama-
teurish creature whose conscience kept him
on the verge of hysteria all the time. Pretty
little Miss Enid Bennett is a very weak and
mild suggestion of the jockey’s indiscreet
sister, and the orchestra, limited in number
and crude in repertoire, added nothing to the
gaiety of nations on Saturday night. “Get-

One more week of “On Our Selection”
will complete the financial triumph of the
Bert Bailey co. at Melbourne King’s. _ The
farcical drama of Dad and his family is
also an artistic achievement in its way, but
the financial splendor of the triumph out-
shines the brightness of the show. The
ancient adage that “there is no sentiment in
business” can consider itself blown out. Biz
at the King’s these last six weeks has oozed
Australian sentiment from every pore, and
will continue to perspire freely until Novem-
ber 1. To-day (Thursday) the management
is chucking the gross proceeds of a matinee
performance into the Lindsay Gordon
memorial fund.

The Max Franklin troupe of acrobats, who
belong to the flying order of gymnasts, are
the latest star turn at Melbourne Opera
House, and they start to be wonderful at
10.10 p.m. on this week’s programme. For
the Rickards’ first part has been swallowed
up by the second part, and the turns run
according to time-table. Thomas Bentley, a
Dickens character-impersonator, with a
talent for being better than some previous
people in the same old sort of entertain-
ment, is another recent addition to the bill.
The noisy Keltons continue to provide un-
welcome relief from the silent effects of
Chinko and Minnie Kaufmann. The face of
Whitburn remains as black as before, and
the mouth of Bluett altereth. Unhappily,
a first attempt to introduce Bernard Shaw
into Melbourne vaudeville society has been
crowned with failure. Miss Dorothy Grim-
ston and two male colleagues gave a vague
interpretation of Shaw’s cynical little draw-
ing-room comedy, “How He Lied to Her
Husband.” Miss Grimston’s sketch of the
showy, mock-sentimental spouse of the
stodgy stockbroker was weak, but graceful.
The husband was gravely pleasant instead
of cheerfully combative; and Henry, the
poetic youth with the courage of his illu-
sions, was represented as a human goat of
enfeebled intellect and doubtful age. Henry
wrapped the proceedings in mystery, and the
jaundiced eye of the audience failed to catch
the hang of the joke.

At the Athenaeum Hall, Melbourne, the
versatile warble of Margaret Cooper, with
her own inimitable accompaniment on the

is coming back with an altered programme
for a good-bye season, “Peter” is a house-

Kelly, when Johnson refused to deadhead
the clergy through to church conferences.
When the church is feeling bad through not
being deadheaded, it has a command of lan-
guage—language of lofty and high-toned re-
proach—that is magnificent.

The Marine Court, in regard to the loss of the
steamer Mark Lane at Gibraltar, has called the at-
tention of the Board of Trade to the fact that foreign
sailors, ignorant of the English language, were un-
able to differentiate orders relating to port and star-
board, and that this was a contributory cause of
much loss of property, besides being a breach of
the Merchant Shipping Act.
The shipowner signs on the cheap and fre-
quent foreigner in preference to the rather
dearer and less frequent Britisher, and saves
a bit that way. If luck holds, he keeps on
saving a bit that way. If luck turns turtle,
the non-linguistic foreigner piles the vessel
UP, and the shipowner loses a bit that way.
Or perhaps the underwriters lose a bit that
way. It's a silly business, whoever loses
the bit.
AT POVERTY POINT.
The English Trades Union Congress has been dis-
cussing the miserable salaries of chorus hand-
maidens. The representatives- of the Amalgamated
Musicians submitted a resolution, emphasising the
necessity of a minimum living wage for these girls,
so as to put an., end to the present “sweating and
degrading conditions.” He quotes agreements show-
ing that chorus girls are engaged at 18s. and even
16s. a week. Out of this they have to pay an
agent’s commission of 10 per cent., purchase board
and lodging and dress decently. It was said that
the profession was an immoral one, but, declared
the speaker amid applause, “such wages constitute
a direct incitement to immorality.” Leading Lon-
don theatrical authorities admit that while the
chorus-girls in. first-class houses, like the Gaiety and
Daly’s, are paid riot so very badly—3os. and some-
times £2 a week—their lot in touring companies is
very dreadful. The stage is rushed by skirted
youngsters in thousands, so unscrupulous managers
can get them at almost any figure.

Adelaide has not long to wait for its second
theatre. As soon as Williamson decided to take a
lease of the Royal instead of building, Sayers and
Lennon got out plans for a new house, and its foun-
dation stone was laid last week. It is to be one
of the biggest in Australia, to have all the latest
ideas in ventilation, seating and stage appurtenances,
and to cost something over £30,000. Name at pre-
sent intended, the Princess. The only thing against
its prospects is a location in the hitherto hopelessly
unfashionable Grote-street. But the firm thinks
that, firstly, the public will go wherever the goods
are good; and, secondly, that that part of the city
is “coming.- : After all, : Victoria-square is the centre
of Adelaide, . and the recent clustering round it of
the King’s (variety), arid Empire, Lyric and Central
(all pictures) , and now .this Princess, with the build-
ing of the Grand Central .- 'Hotel, all goes to explode
the old superstition that everything meant to attract
the public must be within a radius of 100 yards
from Rundle-street corner.
George Edwardes, of London Gaiety, the inventor
of musical comedy, is becoming righteous and cen-
sorious with advancing years. He has been telling an
interviewer that there are “too many risky shows just
now,” and he strongly objects to the London theatre
and music-halls being “continentalised in this
fashion. Sundry people with good memories have
been reminding George that in the days when he
was younger he himself produced some joyous con-
tinental stuff, notably “The Spring Chicken,’ which
most of the critics considered unpleasantly high
and decidedly aromatic. Also, George is strictly
Sabbatarian: “I am for keeping the Day of Rest for
actors, music-hall artists, stage hands and everybody
else connected with places of public entertainment.
If a man wants to go to mass or the church accord-
iner to his creed, let him do so, and after that let
him have rational recreation. It is not rational, nor
would it be beneficial to open theatres and music-
halls on Sundays.” In spite of his English-sounding
name, George Edwardes is an Irish Roman Catholic.
He served his apprenticeship to the theatrical busi-
ness under his uncle, the late Michael Gunn, at Dub-
lin Gaiety. A son of this Gunn was for some time
in partnership with Rupert Clarke and Meynell at
Melbourne Theatre Royal.
“Stargazer” : Who fakes topical verses for the poor
player? My curiosity is excited by the curious bad-
ness of the verses in a country where almost every
second man can write passable rhymes. These topical
jingles are invariably atrocious, but lately they have
displayed a tendency towards lower depths. Miss
Palotta is producing a bunch as addenda to her
“Tact” ditty in “Florodora,” at Melb. Her Majesty’s,
and the struggle to make the Baby Bonus and
sundry subjects of current interest chip in with the
sentiment of the song is so painful that it ought to
draw the attention of the Shakspeare Society, the
Hebrew Agricultural Association, and the Progress
Committee of Gaffney’s Creek. I am of opinion
that the writer, whoever he is, should be prosecuted
under the provisions of the Pure Foods Act. It is
high time the quality of mental pabulum supplied
to the public had some kind of legal supervision.
Young and inexperienced lady orator at Brisbane Liq-
uor Law Reform Convention: “I believe that, at from
19 to 22 years of age, young men arrive at the silly
age, when they would do anything to win a smile
from a pretty barmaid.” The lady is incorrectly
informed. The real “silly age” is the bald-headed
stage between 40 and 50 years. Ask any experienced
ballet-girl.
E. B. Manning has resigned his long-time billet
of secretary to Melbourne Savage Club, to return to
his former sphere of usefulness. Manning came to
Australia with the original Brough-Boucicault Co. as
actor and assistant stage-manager, his wife, Florence
Harcourt, being a beauteous “principal boy,” or
dashing girl in B. and B.’s burlesques and farcical
comedies. Their daughter, Miss Dorothy Manning,
is a soprano balladist with Branscombe’s “Dandies”
Co., and papa E.B. will look after the business in-
terests of the new show at St. Kilda (Melb.).
“U.”: The remarks of “Cockaigne” (B. 10/10/’l2),
concerning the “claque” in English music-halls, urge
me to mention that in Australia there exists a
“claque” system of blackmail. It is worked thus:
A performer about to make his first appearance is
approached with the offer of applause for a con-
sideration. And just what happenes if the considera-
tion is not forthcoming was illustrated not long ago,
when a soprano balladist of more than average vaude-
ville quality was systematically laughed at each time
she took a high note. The artificial laugh was not
echoed by the audience in general, but it frosted
the general gladness, and after a week the music-
hall programme was issued minus the lady’s name.
Of course some turns are such an assured success
from the jump that it is useless for the gang to
attempt “counting out” or “the bird,” but even some
very good performers are sufficiently uncertain of
themselves, before opening in a new ho.use, to fall
victims to the blackmailers. One imported enter-
tainer, who was specially anxious to score at his
first appearance, said to me: “I’ve met plenty of their
sort in England and America, but never fellows who
put on so much style with it. They’re real Willie-
boys—fashionable straw hats and the latest ties, and
the nerve to take as much as a fool performer will
hand over to them. Yes, I’m one of the fools.”
A gay old Irish sporting peer, Lord Rossmore,
who was also an intimate friend of the late King
Edward (so called because he seldom went to bed
early), has just published a volume of reminiscences
containing a few good stories and a lot of chest-
nuts, Some of the latter occur in the chapter on
Melbourne, which Rossmore was visiting at the
same time that Nellie Farren and Fred ? Leslie were
playing their London Gaiety burlesques, at the Prin-
cess. After the performance one night, Rossmore
says he supped with Fred and Nellie at the “little
French club.” Where was that? He probably'
meant the Cafe Denat, in Lonsdale-street, opposite’
St. Francis’s Church, which was flourishing (the
cafe—not the church) about that time. And then
he proceeds to rehash the stories that Fred told dur-
ing the repast. One of them related to a couple of
young bloods who had been making a night of it
and painting the town red. When they met in the
morning this conversation ensued: “Had any break-
fast?” “A chop.” “Anything else?” “A brandy
and soda and a dog.” “Great Scott! What did you
want a dog for?” “To eat the chon, you d d
fool.” That yarn is one of the 12 that are as old
as the ark.

From England comes word of the death
of Bishop Marsden, first occupant of the See
of Bathurst (N.S.W.). He was a grandson
of Parson Marsden of the earlv days, and is
said to have been born at the parson’s farm
—Mamre, South Creek. He was the first
native born who acquired a mitre. Bishop
Parry, of Dover, born at Government House,
Parramatta, was the second.
In the U.S., last month, George Reid was
invited to a reception by a number of suftra-
gists. He declined, according to the Chicago
Recokd-Herald because: —
He was an official of the English Government, and
for that reason he could not discuss political sub-
jects.
It is a staggering attitude. Still, in the
case of Australia’s weird old Yes-No conun-
drum, all is forgiven, because nothing is un-
derstood; just as we do not chide the un-
clothed heathen for his flamboyant deshabille,
but pass hurriedly on and endeavor to forget
him.
By the Oldest Inhabitant: —
William South, whose remains were buried at
Camperdown on Thursday, was the oldest fireman in
Australia, his years being 88. He came to Sydney
with William a’Beckett, afterwards Chief Justice of
Victoria, as “a hoy in buttons.” By way of an early
experience he witnessed the burning of the tvoyal
Hotel and Theatre in George-street in March, 1840.
He had driven Mr. a’Beckett to some function at old
Government House, stabling his horses at George
Castle’s “livery,” which stood in Castlereagh-street,
where the Mont-de-PietC* now lends money at reason-
able interest. In the excitement of the fire he forgot
all about his master, and at three o’clock, when he
got to Government House, everything was in dark-
ness. Mr a’Beckett had plodded home as best he
could. Another big fire was that which consumed
Hughes and Hosking’s Albion Mills, which stood at
the waterside, at the foot of Market-street. (A water-
color of the m.lls is in the Mitchell -Library.) In-
spired by the sight of these conflagrations South
joined the firefighters in 1850, and assisted at the
great burning at Tooth’s Brewery, in 1853, when the
burning 1 beer sounded like the crackling of fools
under the pot—which Scripture is somewhat mixed,
but it doesn’t matter. The great Tooth beer-terrace
was smouldering for three weeks. When too old for
service in the front line of battle, South was ap-
pointed messenger to the Fire Brigades Board.
“Splodger” : Passed over, G. Julius Brock-
man, one of Australia’s great bushmen and
pioneers. Julius came from a large clan in
the West, who have written their names all
over it and done things. Like* most of his
kind, he was a modest talker among strang-
ers. I remember sharing a room with him
many years ago in the old Rose Hotel, Bun-
bury (W.A.), where Julius was having a
spell. One night he gave me a simple jet
graphic account of his big swim for life.
His boat had been capsized early in the
night, it was quite dark, and his companion,
Miller, and a blackfellow were both drowned.
Julius, after seven or eight hours, battled
ashore naked, having been obliged to get rid
of his clothes in the water. He lay ex-
hausted on the sand until the cold drove him
into action. When daylight came, he found
himself 40 miles away from the nearest
settlement. The sun rose, and with it came
the blistering heat. Covering Ifimsalf as bekt
he might with primitive garfnents of sea-
weed, he tramped the whole way back to
civilisation. The wonder is that death could
get a man like that down at the age of 63,
but perhaps he had sassed the Destroyer so
often that the latter grew angry, and made a
special effort, and attacked Julius from
behind with a large piece of road metal, or
set a dog on him, or something.
Died suddenly, in a Sydney tram, Tom
Beasley, aged 46. Beasley wrote good verses,
many of which appeared in The Bulletin
and more in the Sydney Sun. On the latter
paper, and on its forerunner, the Stab, he
had the curious distinction of being specially
employed to write topical verse. He was
probably the first “office poet” permanently
engaged by a newspaper, and he justified his
appointment by the wonderful facility with
which he turned out his smart jingles—often
to the tune of a dozen or 15 sets per week,
for months on end. Beasley was at one time
prominent in the N.S.W. Labor party, and
worked on the central committee in its early
years, with men like W. M. Hughes, Hol-
man and Beeby. Later, he was Labor or-
ganiser in Westralia, and it was , his boast
that he knew the outside tracks of ‘the West,
and the country beyond all tracks, where the
prospectors lead their camels, better than
most men. A genial, kindly soul, full of big
enthusiasms, and modest to a fault, Tom
Beasley will not be among those quickly for-
gotten. Some of his verse in which the local
color is strongest is well worth reprinting,
and through it all there breathes a big manli-
ness and sympathy that is better than the
verse itself.
STANZAS ADDRESSED TO A LADY ON R THE
STARBOARD SIDE OF THE FIRST PART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The “first part” has been abolished at Melbourne
Opera House.- —Daily Fact.
At last, dear lady, we must say farewell;
In private I’ve already shed some tears;
This parting pains me more than I can tell,
Since I have known you for so many years.
I saw you first when I was wont to pay
Good coin to view the grief-provoking show,
Of which you were a part; I need not say
That that was very many years ago.
I think you were a Dutch girl, or, perhaps,
A Geisha; I am not prepared to swear
Whether the First Part then was “Jolly Japs ”
Or “Happy Holland”—but I saw you there.
So cold and proud you seemed, you never smiled
(Nor did your sisters) when the sable blokes
Upon the corners wittily reviled
Each other ; you looked scornful at their jokes.
To me, a callow youth, this seemed most strange,
And I was wont your conduct to deplore;
But time has wrought a most emphatic change,
I marvel not you found each coon a bore!
The chronic lady, with her songandance,
Who, when some poor misguided persons cheer,
Most carefully repeats her dismal prance,
Always provoked you to a bitter sneer.
The years rolled on, and still you failed to smile.
As each old song and jest more dreary grew,
With bitter face you sat there, all the while
My heart in sympathy went out to you.
Your suff’rings all those years I can but guess ;
And yet, it may console you to be told
That mine (and many others) were not less!
In pain we two have grown together old.
Good-bye, old girl. You’ve run your lengthy race —
I’m really trying hard to shed a tear!
In memory you’ll occupy a place,
Among the vanished drinks of yesteryear.
VICTORIA.

The Australian youngster is so precocious that we
experience no difficulty in getting babies to play
parts, however youthful. —Stage manager.
He leaned upon the outward wall,
And smoked a corpulent cigar.
The lady with him was not tall,
But ranked as something of a star.
Miss Montague was rising three,
A veteran of two was he.
He’d fur upon his overcoat,
Her locks were dyed with little care.
He showed a tendency to bloat,
And she had quite a jaded air.
“STAGE DOOR” was painted on a tin,
And soon rehearsal would begin.
Meanwhile they talked of strange old days
Of almost prehistoric arts,
When in the sentimental plays
Quaint dummies played the baby parts.
Said he: “The change surprise evokes —
Now dummies play the grown-up folks!”

An odd Compensation case has been be-
fore a S.A. Court. Deceased was employed
by a butter factory, and —owing to a pass-
ing burglar scare—had laid in a revolver.
As be sat over bis midday sandwich, a shot
was beard, and be was found dead. Acci-
dent or suicide? The coroner said accident,
and the widow claimed £3OO under the
Workmen’s Compensation Act, though jug-
gling with a revolver in a butter factory at
lunch time didn’t seem exactly like busi-
ness. The employers laid stress on an alleged
inaccuracy in the deceased’s accounts, and
eventually the Court differed from the coro-
ner. Not an accident. Not “arising out of,
or in the course of, employment.” No
compensation. But the Supreme Court is
likely to have the chance of hearing the
matter all over again.
Edgar Hoy Krygger, aged 17, of Ballarat
East, or thereabouts, has been notified by the
High Court that his religious scruples can-
not exempt him from military service under
the Commonwealth Defence Act. Edgar
fought the good fight of faith and was de-
feated all along the line. Supported by the
full strength of Holy Writ, he brought his
conscientious objections to bear on the Com-
pulsory Service System, but the High Court
judgment, without showing the least disre-
spect to Holy Writ, left the distressed youth
without a text to stand on. All the argu-
ments of Wowserism were embodied in
Edgar Ivrygger’s affidavit. He said: “All
my spare time is occupied in reading the
Scriptures. It is against the Word of God
to. attend drill. The Scriptures tell us if
thine enemy smite thee on the cheek turn to
him the other also. We have to do good to
those who hate us, and especially we are
told in the Bible that in the last days there
shall be wars and rumors of wars, but the
children of God are not troubled by these
things. Those that take the sword shall
perish by the sword.” And the High Court
knocked poor Edgar out by explaining that
his religious objections would get full atten-
tion in time of war. The colonel would say
to him : “Thou shalt not kill,” and order him
into the commissariat department, or the
ambulance waggon, or command him to do
good to them that hate him by bandaging
wounded prisoners in the field hospital. In
short, Edgar’s scruples are fully safeguarded.
There is nothing left for him but to kneel
at Ins bedside and thank the Lord that he will
be trained in time of peace to become an
efficient non-combatant in time of war. Up
to now he has given all his spare time to
reading the Scriptures, and is presumably a
flabby-dabby Krygger who couldn’t even dig
a decent soldier’s grave. The Defence Act
will try to inspire him to expand into a mus-
cular Iverristian, and will perhaps teach him
to_ march along the path of righteousness
without bending his knees.
The Australian navy is to be of the Cold
Water type as far as grog aboard may go.
Admiral King-Hall mentioned the fact at a
recent meeting. He gave the genesis of
teetotalism in the R.N. The movement com-
menced in 1860 on the battleship Russell, of
which his father was captain, and he—the
Admiral—a midshipmite. The captain called
the men together, and pointed out that most
ot the crime—looking askance at a petty
officer was crime in those days—arose from
drink. He asked how many men would
volunteer to forego their allowance of grog
for three months if he would abstain from
wine for the same period. (Whether he
abstained from other liquors doesn’t appear;
perhaps he didn’t care for wine.) Forty vol-
unteered. At the end of three months, 30 more
joined, and gradually the drought spread.
V\ nether the teetotal sailor will be as good
a fighter as the old drunken one nobody
knows, for it is many, many years since the
British navy saw active service. When it
does go into battle on a big scale, with his
Majesty’s ship Cold Tea in the van, fol-
lowed by the Rechabite, Templar, Wowser,
Teetotaller, Drought, Son of Temperance,
and other new leviathans, and with his
Majesty’s superannuated gunboat Jim Jam
sinking on the edge of the horizon, it will be
a great spectacle. Also, it will be a great
experiment. The question arises whether a
country which depends so wholly on naval
defence as Britain does shouldn’t have a
Drunken Squadron in reserve in case of
accidents.

“The Anarchist”: Bennett Burleigh, the
old man correspondent of the London Daily
Telegraph, states that the Bulgarian troops
are clad in uniforms of homespun and family
stitchery. Well done, Bulgaria, famed for
its roses and its timber-trees; its crops of
corn and tobacco; its production of wine
and silk ; for its mobs of cattle and horses;
its herds of swine and its flocks of sheep.
But Bulgaria grows flax and hemp as well
as roses and timber-trees. It owns few man-
ufacturing industries, and what there are for
home consumption. But every housewife
has her spinning-jenny, and very village miss
her hand-loom. _ So Bulgaria’s sons fare
forth to battle in garb of their own beget-
ting, somewhat differently equipped than
their Servian _ foes of the 1885 campaign,
whose Jew-built overcoats were washed off
their backs in the first rainstorm they en-
countered, being only glued instead of sewn
together. We have just got over an all-
Australian-made goods’ sale-week, and criti-
cal remarks have been fired at the poor
showing of the procession. Our Australian
manufacturers should wake up, and take a
leaf out of little Bulgaria’s book. An entire
army of homespun-clad warriors isn’t a bad
advertisement for the enterprise of a country
which has no manufactures to speak of, or
rant about.

The essential fraudulency of Melbourne
Savage Club was remarked, the other day,
by a rough-edged bloke who brought a mes-
sage to the management from one of the pic-
ture shows. When the plain, unvarnished
visitor was explaining his business, the func-
tionary who received him glanced coldly at
his slouch hat and suggested that he should
stand bareheaded on the mat. The bloke, re-
moving his lid. said, “Spare me days! I
thought yer called yerselves Savages?”
“Tom Catiline”: Melbourne University
is having its peace violently disturbed. The
Students’ Magazine recently arose in
wrath and said that if the taxpaying public
knew how the Uni. was conducted, it would
first laugh and then go for an axe. When
the people who, on occasion, deck themselves
in ridiculous and antiquated colored robes
read the forceful remarks, they were stricken
with a great and solemn silence at the idea
that anybody could be so lost to a sense of
decency as to criticise them. After they had

recovered their power of speech they met
together, breathing out slaughter and rusti-
cation. Prof. Masson, of the bottle-and-
smell department, wanted expulsions whole-
sale. Other dignitaries supported him.
Sugden, Master of Queen’s, and a few other
persons of comparative sobriety, restrained
the fretful desires of Masson to start deal-
ing out large and wholesale quantities of
rustication, and the Students’ Representative
Council was merely told not to do it again.
But the S.R.C. wasn’t in a respectful mood,
and taking its reforming zeal seriously, held
a meeting at which, to the horror of the
magnates, it virtually announced: (1) that
the students’ paper wasn’t going to be cen-
sored ; (2) that if the dignitaries didn’t like
criticism they could go on disliking it. Fur-
ther, by way of pouring kerosene on the
smouldering waters, the meetifig appointed
the writer of the offending article as one of
a committee to talk to Prof. Masson, if he
wanted any explanations. He did; but he
objected to the writer in question with great
vigor. He is still objecting, and the S.R.C.
continues to uphold the offender. Threats
of rustication are once more flying round,
and counter-threats of a general strike of
students keep things lively. The whole
uproar suggests a" tornado in a milk jug or
something, but it also offers a hint that
Willie Watt might find time to cast an eye
over the students’ complaints—the con-
tinual absence of professors, the hopeless
inefficiency of their substitutes, the arbitrary
follies of examiners, and the awful condi-
tion of the class-rooms.

So far, Premier Watt has given no hint
as to the terms on which expert C. H. Merz
has come to advise as to the electrification
of the Vic. suburban railways. In the re-
port he made to the late Bent Government,
Merz indicated £32,000 as his fee for plan-
ning and supervising the whole contract, but
he is a bigger man now than he was then,
and there are rumors that as much as 5 per
cent, on the 2| million contract —about
£125,000 —is the figure. It is time the Oppo-
sition dug some information out of Watt re
Metz’s fee, the sources of power supply and
other items. It will be too late to criticise
after the contracts are signed.
Melbourne Argus made a strange break,
the other day, when it tried to derive the
word “caucus” from the Latin. If the said
term came from the Latin, it was a darned
long time coming, and it must have got sore
feet on the road, especially as the highways
were very bad in the Middle Ages. The
common acceptation is that it is simply a
corruption of “caulkers”—the caulkers in
the shipyards of Boston (U.S.A.) having
been specially aggressive and anti-Bull in
1770, and being much given to secret soci-
eties. An American dictionary says it is an
Indian word, and should be spelled cawcaw-
wassough. This writer believes that in
reality it is simply a meeting of crows. They
caw first and then they cuss. The fact that
an Indian tribe bore the name of the Crows
is strong evidence in favor of this view.
Besides, the crow was well known to the
Latins, and it caulks its nest carefully.

“Men’s Outfitters,”
309=311 GEORGE STREET, SYDNEY.
On Saturday last, the .Sydney man sped
up back streets, and lost himself in the maze
of traffic in order to escape the annual United
Charities female with the extravagant smile
and the rattling wooden box with the handle,
and the grin cut in the lid for the coins to
fall through. This one-day hold-up appeals
to a lot of flappers and grown women who
ordinarily only bushrange a father, husband
or other defenceless relative. The license to
smile at the whole street and pursue perfect
strangers for cash appeals to the adventur-
ous, and affords others a gentle glow of
satisfaction at having shown off nice dresses
and stunning hats. But the general feeling
amongst the man victims is one of weari-
ness and curse. Women, the short-sighted
and illogical wearer of back-to-front gar-
ments and ideas, is always willing to squan-
der her energy on futile things. So the
widespread raid with its social fuss and its
inadequate result impedes the traffic on one
dreaded day in the year, and helps to delay
the time when the taxpayer will do his share
quietly and without excitement through the
State, instead of being bailed up for it 700
times in the public street by flushed and
headlong she-collectors who won’t take a
civil “No,” yet must not be treated rudely.
If the water-rate, the dog-tax and other
necessary charges were harried out of the
public penny by penny like the hospital-tax,
life would not be worth living. Still, that is
what a lot of women appear to be aiming
at the whole year round.

“K.” : Another form of Suffering Woman-
hood was revealed at Melbourne County Court
last week. Nellie Lyons, late of Macßob-
ertson’s lolly factory, charged the boss with
assaulting her. The foreman, she said, held
her by the hands until Macßobertson came
and opened her handbag, and loosened her
blouse, and compelled her to take her skirt
off to convince him that she had no lollies
concealed about her person. On the other
hand, Mac and his foreman denied all the
young lady’s statements re her clothing, but
stated that, being caught with half a pound
of jubes in her handbag, she admitted that
it was not her first larceny of the kind.
After which, she was forgiven her offence
because she said she was a poor orphan. In
her capacity of poor orphan Nellie claimed
£149 damages for the alleged assault. The
Court found for the defendant with costs,
and suggested that the bereaved young
woman should be prosecuted for perjury.
Her “gall” was a direct incentive to harsh-
ness, anyhow. Next time one of Macßob-
ertson’s girls is suspected of making free
with the lollies, the boss will probably pre-
fer to fetch a policeman to assault her hand-
bag and shake chocolates from her clothing.
A MATTER OF HORSE-POWER.
THE PURCHASER (between gasps): “But It-
th-thought (bump) you said the h-house
(bump) was only th-th-three (lump)
in-minutes from the (bump) s-st-station?"
THE HOUSE AGENT: “ W-well (bump), the
car can do e-eighty (bump) an hour, an-
and (bump, bump) if we don't meet the
c-co-cop (bump) I'll prove it."
CHEAP LABOR.
ALERNON DOOLITTLE: “Haw! These bweastly
council fellahs would make menials of us,
don' tcherknow."
BELINDA THINKLITTLE : “Another result of
the awful Socialistic legislation, I suppose."
“Leges”: Every citizen ought to follow
my example, and keep a record of big, un-
detected crimes I even keep the Gatton
murders alive in my mind. The police say :
“Oh, the affair will be forgotten directly.”
It is, but it shouldn’t
be. Melbourne has 90
per cent, of Aus-
tralia’s worst unde-
tected crimes. There
is the murder of the
diamond m e r chant
Bauer, in his Col-
lins-street office, and
£2OOO stolen. Un-
detected. There is
the poisoning of Mrs.
Moodie and her two
daughters in Prah-
ran. U n d e t e ct ed.
Again, the heavy rob-
bery from the Eng-
lish, Scottish and
Australian Bank
branch at Box Hill.
Undetected. A second
attempt at the same
place frustrated by the
robber being shot in
the arm. Uncaught.
Hawthorn omnibus
stuck up and passen-
gers robbed. Unde-
detected. Three ladies
bailed up and house
robbed at Vaucluse,
Richmond. Unde-
tected. Robbery of
about £4OO worth of
gold from policeman
in charge of Mel-
bourne Mint. And
add the Ballarat
murder of the woman Graham.
The rat legend is immortal. It is now
declared that the rodents abandoned the
700 ft. level of the North Lyell mine (Tas.)
some days before the fire. Is there any old
bank official who can remember if the rats
abandoned the premises of the Federal Bank,
and the City of Melbourne Bank,
and the Real Estate Bank, and the Aus-
tralian Banking Co. when they were totter-
ing towards the final and incurable sus-
pension?

“Lantana” : From the Sydney Mourning
Herald (12/10/T2) :
O’SULLIVAN.-“The Friends of Mr. and Mrs.
THOMAS MALONEY are kindly invited to at-
tend the Funeral of their dearly beloved NIECE,
Eileen O’Sullivan. (Funeral took place last
Thursday, in the Catholic Cemetery, Waverley.
This advertisement should have appeared in last
Thursday’s issue.)
I enter this as the most flagrant case of
missing the ’bus on record.
“Chasuble” : There
are three Melbourne
churches so rich that
there is no occasion
to bother either
about saving souls
or saving money.
These are St. James’s
Old Cathedral; St.
John’s, in Latrobe-
street; and the Col-
lin s-street Independ-
ent. The last-named
magnificent place is
a complete simula-
crum, wretchedly at-
tended. During over
20 years of Capillary
Bevan, its population
grew small by de-
grees and beautifully
less. But it has lots
of property! St.
James’s is an exam-
ple of a swindle per-
petrated 70 years
ago. Fi-om Govern-
ment there was then
cadged that immense
.area bounded bv Col-
lins, William and
Bourke streets. All
got for sacred pur-
poses. And what is
done with it? Ware-
houses built, and
many of them deal in
liquor, fetching in
many thousands a
year income. Now I
ask in all equity,
ought not the Gov-
ernment to have the
rents? What is the
use of being holy
without being right-
ous? Land not required for consecrated
purposes should be given back. St. James’s
pays the somewhat poor wages of Arch-
deacon Hindley and Dean Stephen, and
pours the other thousands into the, general
Church treasury. Part has gone towards
the maintenance of Bendigo diocese. The
St. James’s congregation is ridiculous in
paucity—about half a man and a dog. Yet
maybe £9OOO a year is collected. St. John’s
is rather better attended, but' poorly. The
denominational conscience awakes. At the
late Synod steps were taken to make
St. James’s and St. John’s mission churches,
in the hands of live, young, energetic men,
really leavening the city. As it is, those
churches are only billets, like the mouldy,
cobwebby places in London, with fat salaries
and handfuls of people.
* * * *
A recent happening in Ballarat (Vic.)
affords a sort of insight into the workings of
the ultra-religious mind. An old lady of
that village, of thrifty habit but distrustful
ways, had accumulated some £2OO in notes
and gold, and put her fortune in a locked
box in her bedroom. She suddenly missed
the capital. As it could scarcely have left
the country “on its own,” she desired the
police to find out who assisted it. There
dwelt with her an unmarried daughter of 50
and a religious turn of mind, and a niece.
The latter, being an ordinary woman of
more-or-less heathen tendency, was imme-
diately suspected, and metaphorically turned
inside out —to no purpose. Then it struck
the Law that possibly the extra-good Chris-
tian might know a little about the vanished
cash. She did. In fact, she knew all, having
at various times and occasions removed it
unbeknownst to its owner, and bestowed it
on church collections, missions to heathens
and the like. She claimed that, having de-
voted another person’s property to a good
purpose, she had done no wrong; but the fact
that she at first strenuously denied having
touched the money at all throws a large
doubt on her claim. Still, she isn’t the first
one who has persuaded herself that the end
justifies the means.
The miniqns of Victorian Police Chief
O’Callaghan are such careless, untidy per-
sons that, the other day, they made no re-
mark when a man, convicted of petty lar-
ceny, was handed a nominal sentence of
three months and allowed out on recog-
nisances as a first offender. A few days
later he committed a more serious annoy-
ance, and was committed to the General Ses-
sions. There it was discovered that he had,
only two days before he became a first
offender, left Pentridge aftfer a compulsory
residence of 15 months, and that even before
that he had dwelt there for two years. He
now returns for an indefinite' period. No
wonder there is a loud whoop that the Vic-
torian average of gaol population is decreas-
ing rapidly. The wonder is that anyone is
ever unlucky enough to get into gaol at all.
THEY HAD BEEN SAMPLED.
CISSY : “Monty is much better-looking than
Ted!"
GERTIE : “I don't know —I like Ted's mouth
best."
CISSY: “Oh, of course, that's merely a matter
of taste."
OUR ENERGETIC RICH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Archbishop of York says the selfishness and
luxury of the idle rich cause more industrial unrest
than the agitators they sneer at. Happily the Argus
is able to assure us there are no idle rich in Aus-
tralia.
With us there are no idle rich,
They’re captains all of industry.
They bake, or build, or sow, or stitch,
And make the clashing engines gee.
Where mighty business is astir
You’ll find the energetic Meat
Within a cushioned office seat.
Please note the fine, emphatic air
With which he wears his cultured feet.
Where motors rush with lightning speed,
Or caught within the social whirl,
Our rich are busy men, indeed.
Their grand vitality they hurl
With courage that respect commands
Into the hunt. They race and het,
Their brows are moist with honest stveat,
And by the sweating of their “hands”
They still a frugal living get.

THE HIGHER ART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The suggestion by the Minister for Education (Mr.
Carmichael) that the City Council should lease to the
Government portion of the Belmore Market Buildings
for temporary use as a conservatorium of music and
school of art, has come to nothing. The building has
been leased to Messrs. Wirth Bros, for use as a circus
arena.— A Sydney news item.
I beheld the artist wildly rant,
And savagely pull his hair
In front of the graceful ele-phant
And the large performing bear.
From a high trapeze, a monkey swung
While the peanuts thickly flew ;
Poised high on a pole a .tiger clung,
And a somersault he threw.
Before a cage an audience had
Committed a loud-lunged fuss r
I wondered what made the people glad—
’Twas the hip-po-pot-a-mus.
And before another I saw a score
Of boisterous laughing lots—
A boa constrictor on the floor
Was tying himself in knots.
But more I saw as I wandered through,
Beholding the sights alone;
A lion was chewing, as lions do,
At an unprotesting bone.
He bared his teeth, and he fiercely growled
With wild, primordial rage,
What time his furtive missus prowled,
And pawed the bars of the cage.
The gorilla grasped an iron bar,
And stared as if to behold
One man who hadn’t progressed too far
To come back into the fold.
His forehead sloped, and his beady eyes
Glared greedily where I stood,
As though he meant to express surprise
At loss of my monkeyhood.
The wild dog yelled, and the eagle shrieked,
And the monkeys swung with glee;
While the atmosphere with odors reeked
There, in Brown’s menagerie.
And T . watched the high-browed artist rant
As he fiercely pulled his Jiair
In front of the graceful ele-phant
And the large, expensive bear.

REBECCA ( on the eve of her marriage): “ Oh,
fader, vy do you weep?”
SOLOMON: “ Because to-morrow, my tear, lam
going to give you away.”
“Te Kuri” : Re this dog controversy. It
is faintly possible that the origin of the word kuri
lies in the Maori attempt to pronounce the English
word. Here are some other instances: “Poneke” is
said to be the Maori name for Wellington. It is
not. It is the Maori’s attempt to pronounce Port
Nicholson (the original name of the settlement).
Similarly “heketere” is the nearest the Maori can
get to secretary, but no one would suggest that it is
the original Maori word for that functionary. The
noise that he makes in saying shilling sounds more
like hiringi than anything; and it is in fact so
spelt in the native summons form of the Magis-
trates’ Court, which form is put in his own tongue
for the benefit of the ingenuous Henare. In fact,
one might say that fully 10 per cent, of the alleged
native names for places and things are nothing more
than the Maori attempts to pronounce the English
names, and his failure in such attempts is due to
the absence of several consonants sounds in his lan-
guage ( e.g S, D, F, B, and L). He has not, of
course, got an alphabet at all, but has learned the
English one, or as much of it as he needs. His
alphabet was fixed up for him by good Moravian
missionaries, and so became fairly phonetic and
escaped the British taint.
Dr. Mjoberg has been considering Binglii
in his habit as he lives in Northern Australia, and
the deductions he draws are as depressing as they
are old. He says:—
It is no use trying to civilise the aborigine;
civilisation means deterioration and death. The
best way to save them is to let them alone. Mis-
sions are of no use.
And so says the best scientific opinion all over the
world. The herding of the discolored ones in mis-
sion stations does no good either to the herders or
the herded. The missionary fondly imagines he
saves their souls. It may be so, but he certainly
brings them no material benefit. Dr. Skottsberg, in
his just-published book, “The Wilds of Patagonia,”
remarks forcefully, that the attempt to civilise pri-
mitive races is only another name for extermination,
and is, besides, a waste of energy. It is plainly im-
possible to change the habits and ideas of a whole
people in a few years, or even in the lifetime of a
single generation. It has taken more than that to
bring the Maoris and Fijians to their present con-
dition, and it is very doubtful whether either race is
more than superficially civilised. Above all things,
it is necessary not to deceive ourselves by imagining
that we have nothing to do but put the savage into
a suit of clothes, and teach him his catechism to
make him into a civilised man. Much more than
that is needed, as the British have found in Egypt
and India, the Russians in Siberia, and the French
in Africa. In none of those cases were the people
dealt with primitive savages, still they cannot be
raised to European standard.
“N. or M.” : Apropos of the great sorrow-
ful eyes of the octopus, “A Nehoc” (B. 26/9/’l2)
falls upon “Reka” with the pen of scorn and the
ink-bottle of contumely. The monopolists’ patron
saint has, says he, smallish eyes “which very much
resemble the headlights or cow-catcher of a flat-
head.” Well, then, Staepo#le, of “The Blue Lagoon,”
is out of it. He makes rather a point of the
eyes. Attend! “In the deep water of the pool,
gazing up and forward and straight at Dick, she
saw a face lugubrious and awful. The eyes were
wide as saucers, stony and steadfast; a large,
TILE GENTLE ANSWER.
BIG BULLOCK IV.: “Stand up! Wodjer mean
by praying in my presence?"
REV. V. OYLITUNG: “ Pardon, your Majesty;
'twas ever my custom to say grace before
meat!"
neavy, parrot-like beak hung before the eyes, and
worked and wobbled and seemed to beckon. But
what froze one’s heart was the expression of the
eyes, so stony and lugubrious, so passionless, so
devoid of speculation, yet so fixed of purpose and
full of fate.... The octopod has only been described
once, in stone, by a Japanese artist. The statue
is still extant, and it is the most terrible thing in
sculpture done by human hands. It represents a
man who has been bathing on a low-tide beach, and
has been caught. The man is shouting in a delirium
of terror, and threatening with his free arm the
spectre that has him in its grip. The eyes of the
octopod are fixed upon the man—passionless and
lugubrious eyes, but steadfast and fixed.” They
look like two Moseses after the light went out. By
the way, in a recent par. I am credited with saying
that it is the “killer” whale that surfeits himself
on octopod, and then suffers from ambergris. Not
so. It is the spermaceti whose unearned increment
makes him so much sought after. The killer is
the savage beast that hunts his more cumbrous
relative with a view to devouring his tongue. He
has .an unpleasant habit of biting off one of the
victim’s fins in order that the maimed creature
may circle helplessly and fail to escape.

“Nunawading” : One Harndcker, of Ligua,
South America, has written to Prime Minister
Fisher, recommending the introduction to Australia
of the quique, a rab-
bit destroyer of the
weasel or ferret tribe.
Cricketer Frank Allan,
Victorian rabbit and
general vermin inspec-
tor, has furnished a
report on the sugges-
tion. He urges cau-
tion, in view of Aus-
tralia’s dreadful ex-
perience with rabbits,
foxes, sparrows, star-
lings, Indian minahs
and so many other ex-
otics. Darwin wrote
of changes under do-
mestication ; equally
wondrous are the
changes that occur
under acclimatisation.
The rabbit is a curse,
but at least he is an
edible curse, and he
neither bites nor

plague of quiques or ferrets! It would approximate,
in hideousness, to a plague of skunks or the spec-
tacle of the sun blotted out by blue-bottles.

Gil : Like the man who backs racehorses
and buys shares in an imaginary mine, the average
stoush-patron is an optimistic animal. Recently I
was sitting next to a Melbourne biff-enthusiast
while a lop-sided mill was in progress. One of the
scrappers was obviously outclassed from the start,
but the man at my elbow, who had backed him to
the tune of a quarter of a pound, never became the
least discouraged. “He’ll bring that right hand
over directly,” he told me, confidentially. The
Superior Pug continued to deal out fury; but it
made no difference to my friend. “Wait till he
brings over that right,” he whispered, and winked
knowingly. Still the Other Fellow smote hard and
often, and hit out of his turn with monotony,
and the chap with the Terrible Right began to look
like a slaughter-yard or a friendly football match
between two Sunday-schools. “He’s waiting to
swing his right,” my friend assured me. The Man
with the Devastating Right was now looking like a
battlefield. “He’ll bring over that right in a
minute,” my friend remarked, “and then it’s a
case of good-bye.” But somehow the Dreadful
Right continued to be missing—and so was the
Dreadful Left, for that matter. They shaped up
for the Bth round. “He’ll whip that right in now,”
my friend informed me. “You just watch.” 1
watched. The right was whipped in, sure enough.
But it was the Other Fellow’s right, and his op-
ponent went down and out. “It was dashed bad
luck,” said my friend; “for he was just going to
whip in his right.”
“O.B.”: Watched the common household
variety of spider capturing his prey the other day,
and found my respect for his intelligence rise like
the temperature of Hades after the arrival of a
Beef Truster. Flies were scarce, because a fly-paper
had been getting in its best work, and the few
sleek insects which had not been captured were wise
and wary. The spider had been making poor sport,
but at length, by a cautious advance on all eights,
he contrived to get within six inches of a well-
nourished disease distributor. The fly looked as if
he understood the situation, and the spider saw that
he must use his higher scientific skill. Fixing his
web-line to the wall, at a point directly above the
fly, and calculating the distance to a fraction of an
inch, he slowly crawled along, paying out cable, until
the space separating him from his original base was
exactly equal to that between his original base and
his prospective dinner. The fly smiled in his fancied
security, but his joy was short lived. The spider
let go with eight hands, and, swinging on the loose
line, came right on top of his victim. The subse-
quent grab and disabling of the quarry were too
fast for the eye to follow, but the howls of glee
from the spider, and the agonised shriek of the fly,
will haunt ine to my grave.

'‘Eddyson”: The waters came down at
Kyhore with extraordinary activity, with the result
that in three days a mild drought gave place to five
or six feet of water all over the face of nature, and
the river’s brim was stretched out to the horizon.
And still it rained. On the sixth day, a Saturday,
a party of three in the punt from Richo’s vineyard,
cruising about in quest of adventure and derelicts,
espied Peter William Heyfield reclining in the fork
of a white gum. The rescue brigade rowed up
alongside, and invited Peter to come aboard. “Oh,
I’m orl ri’,” said P.W. Heyfield. “I think I’ll stop
a lil’ while longer.” “Better not,” he was warned.
“She’s still risin’.” “Tha’s true, but no ’arm won’t
come t’ me. I kin swim a bit, ’n’ they’s a dead
limb here wot I come up on.” “Don’t you be a
fool,” said Grigg; “come off while you gotter
charnce.” “Point iv fact, I can’t,” replied Pete.
“See I’m sorter keepin’ a happointment.” “An ap-
pointment—here?” “Yarrs. Me ’n’ me girl alwiz
meets ’ere Saturdees. She’s jist about jue now.
Reckon I orter wait.” “But, great Scott, how’s a
girl goin’ t’ keep an ensanguined happointment in
seven feet iv worter?” “I dunno, but Jess is wot
you might call resourceful. I won’t go, annyway—
’twouldn’t be gentlemanly.” “Arr-r, come along,
don’t be an ass.” “Couldn’t. Wot ’ud Jess say ?”
They spent ten minutes longer, trying to woo Peter
William Heyfield down from his perch, but Peter’s
faith in Jess was not to be shaken. “Leave ’er
alone,” he said confidently, “she’ll turn up. She
alwiz does.” The party in the punt paddled off, and
after cruising round a bit sighted a strange sail.
Drawing nearer, they discovered the curious craft to
be a large pig trough in which a very bony girl was
paddling industriously. It was Jess going to keep
her appointment.
THE RABBITER’S CURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Robby the Rabbiter loved his glass—
Loved it a little too much, alas!
His camp was close to the Mulga Inn,
Which served as a shrine to his favorite sin.
Most of the nights in a week you’d see
Robby involved in a moderate spree,
Leaving the pub at a blameful hour
Full as a well-filled bag of flour.
Robby a rum-looking gee-gee owned,
Light of the flesh but amply boned,
Ugly and lazy and underbred,
With a bumble-foot and a coffin-head.
Night after night this steed was tied
To the rail at the pub; and the horses shied
Time and again at the ancient wreck,
With its hat-rack hips and its hose-pipe neck.
Over a bottle of Ted’s “three star”
Bill and a mate at the Mulga bar
Fashioned a plot of the deepest guile
And left the pub with a four-inch smile.
Down the paddock the schemers sped
And found a horse that had long been dead,
One of those frames of bone and hide
That the crows have picked and the wind has
dried.
When the sun went down old Rob appeared
With blood of rabbits and horse-sweat smeared,
Riding the crock he was wont to ride;
And he tied him up and he went inside.
Out of the big scrub crept the dark,
And the stars rose over the stringy-bark.
They took his crock to the stable' yard
While Rob at the bar was drinking hard.
Then they saddled the horse that was dried and
dead,
And slipped Rob’s bridle over his head,
And stood him up by the dim horse-rail,
With a waggon propstiek beneath his tail.
Then they greeted their man at the Mulga bar,
And they filled him up with good “three star,”
Till the hour grew late and the sleepy Ted
Gave a yawn or two and suggested bed.
Rob was enjoying himself just then,
But the clock in the bar said half-past ten,
So he called all hands for a final shout,
And emptied his glass and stumbled out.
He took his reins with a heavy sigh
From the rail, and murmured a thick “Goo’-
b.ve t”
Then he lifted his toe to the stirrup-bar
With a “AYoh, my beauty!” and “Stand
there, Star!”
Now, as soon as the framework felt his foot,
It fell to the ground like rotten fruit,
And Rob with a shriek and sundry groans
Clasped to his bosom the bunch of bones.
They picked him up and they led him in
To the beer-stained shrine of his ancient sin,
Where, gibbering under the darkened bar,
He sought relief from the ghosts that are.
To the Mulga Inn on the lonely rise
The teamsters flock like thirsty flies,
And the drovers gather like gulls offshore,
But Robby the Rabbiter comes np more.

Kell Gilbert writes on a horsey matter:
Re your article (“An Official that Would Save the
State Money” [B. 26/9/’l2]), advocating the ap-
pointment of an expert horse-master to superintend
the buying and breaking-in of the Commonwealth’s
re-mounts. This step has long been urged among
such backblockers as are interested in, and under-
stand the ways of, the Friend of Man. The old, bar-
baric way of horse-taming is going out. The new—
and infinitely more effective—one is slowly gaining
a foothold, and for innumerable reasons should be
given all the encouragement possible. The very “worst”
—or to use the intelligent language of the enlightened
horse-educator—the most timid and cross-grained
horses have been made “lambs” by such men as
Skuthorpe, Lang, Jeffery, Marshall and others, with
none of the hideous torture that used to be con-
sidered essential. But huinanitarianism as regards
the horse is still, so to speak, in the pioneering
stage. The ancient practice of fiercely bullying
the wretched animal which happens to be over-
nervous, or something exceptional in the way of
high-spiritedness, continues to be glorified in the
most unexpected quarters. Take the following from
a yarn entitled, “The Buckjumper and the
Baby,” which appeared in the Sydney Mail
(18/9/’12): “On tiptoes, like a nervous cat, she
stood trembling at the feel of a man on her back
for the first time, her thin nostrils palpitating and
her sides heaving... .All right, Bill; let her go !....
Then, with a squeal of rage she jumped wildly for-
ward.... trying desperately to shift the weight on
her back.. . .beautiful bucker... .angry cunning effort
without a stop... .Campbell enjoyed it.... the mare
grew hot and angry. .. .while every nerve quivered
and her blood-streaked eye flashed. Tired at last
she steadied down sullenly... . exhilarating pastime
good fun. But the lesson was not finished
.. . .the mare stood sulkily in the middle of the
yard. Campbell lashed her with green-hide rope.
.. . .while she cowered, viciously showing the whites
of her eyes.” Then follows a gory description of a
similar conflict out in the open, at the end of which
the hog or ruffian Campbell again plied the green-
hide. It is a tragic fact that the infamy done by the
beast Campbell, as described with such queer relish
in an allegedly pious and respectable publication, is
widely accepted as necessary in the case of most un-
broken horses. Of course it isn’t. I am “breaking-
in,” or, rather, I am “educating” some horses at
Harrow station, in Queensland, at present, and have
done a good deal in that line in the past. In the
light of experience I contend that better results can
be achieved, practically every time, by gentleness
and patience. The horse-butcher is a relic really of
the Dark Ages which knew, as familiar figures, the
assigned-servant flogger and the nigger-shooter.
“Ruru” : If Cohen judges his Maoriland
asset by its apparent area on the map, he is apt to
be disappointed when he really comes to take stock
and value the pledges he has accepted. Ell,
M.H.R., mentioned the other day that sand areas
occupy 2,900,000 acres in the North Island, and
24,000 acres in the South. Also, an enormous amount
of the South Island is taken up by rocks, precipices,
snow, glaciers, ravines, lakes, rivers, shingle wastes,
stony river-beds and ferny country, where only wild

pigs blossom in the spring. The North Island,
again, wastes its acreage with swamps, pumice, vol-
canic desolations, mud-baths, hot springs and gum
lands, where vegetables and mutton are not. Put
up to auction by the mortgagee, an object of art
like Mbuht Cook might bring a fancy price, and
there are a lot of little lakes, waterfalls, and things
that' cu rio-collectors might like for their drawing-
rooms or their back hair, but the actual space
available for making wheat sprout and causing fat

COW COCKY : “ A fiver ! Wot sort of a cow can yer expect to get for a fiver? An ’ what's
the good of a baby if you've nothin for it to milk?”
“Vagabond”: I know a girl who had a
somewhat similar experience to that of “Reka”
(B. 22/8/’l2), but when I asked her what sort of
features were owned by the octopus which clam-
bered aboard the boat, the only description the girl
could give me was an attack of hysterics and a
wild appeal that I wouldn’t mention the dreadful
thing again. She and a girl pal were out fishing in
a boat which was anchored in the vasty deep of
Yowie Bay, about 6yds. from shore. Being fully
provisioned with a supply of chocolates
and novels, they merely dropped the
lines overboard and left the fish to
catch themselves. After an hour or
two one girl pulled up her line, and,
as the last thing on earth or sea she
expected to get was a fish, there was
wild excitement when an evident re-
luctance to be hauled in told that
the -hook had got something. Yet
the wild excitement was mild com-
pared with what happened when a
ropy-looking tentacle slid over the
gun’l and groped round. Both girls
gave an excellent unrehearsed imita-
tion of a steam siren in a fit, and
when another arm or two followed,
and it was plain that The Thing was
coming aboard, the fisherwomen pressed
the button and made the welkin ring
its clapper loose. When the head,
face, figure or body appeared, one
girl unanimously departed over the
other side of the boat, and the other
girl swiped wildly at the nightmare
with an oar. The octo. let go and
sunk hurriedly, and the girl shrieked
to her friend to get back, as It was
in the water again, flung the end of
the line overboard, and tried to poke
the visitor down out of sight with the
oar. She poked too enthusiastically,
and went overboard after it. For the
next minute the boat must have
looked like a chip in a cyclone, or
waterspout, or geyser of soapsuds, as
the swimmers threshed round in a
frantic endeavor to climb back aboard
out of reach of the devil which they
were positive was clutching at their
heels. Probably the fish was breaking the sprint
record for home and mother, and to this day tells
its friends of the awful-looking monsters it encoun-
tered that day.

“Snell”: On the second day of my stay,
Ernest Spence, who was a 1 Geordie miner, came
home, rolling drunk, and the concern of his poor
little wife touched my heart. How that wretched
woman went on, what tears, what reproaches, what
bitterness and despair! Truly, methought, thought
I, drink is a curse. Five days later Spence came
home more rolling than before. He finally plunged
head forward under the kitchen table into the pan
the dog was lapping the last of the soup from, and
I lent a hand in hauling him forth, shoring him up,
and towing and tacking him to bed. This time
there were no complaints from Mrs. Spence, no
tears, no dismal prognostications of a black future
of starvation, debt and depravity. In fact, she
came forth from the final disposing of Spence, wear-
ing a smile of great beatitude, and said she: “Ay,
he’s a dagger, they boy Ernie! He’s bin got
hisself chock full up for nothin’.” Ernest had been.
to a mine christening, and his sliickered condition
was a pure gift.
“N. or M.”: “Pete’s” Maori warrior who
laid claim to an allotment of land on the strength of
having killed and eaten the previous occupier, recalls
an experience of F. E. Manning, as told in his volume
of recollections (“Old New Zealand,” by a Pakeha
Maori). Manning, who settled in Maoriland in 1833,
had purchased a portion of Earth’s epidermis be-
longing to the natives. “I really can’t tell to the
present day,” he says, “who I bought the land from,
for there were about 50 different claimants, every
one of whom assured me that the other 49 were hum-
bugs and had no right whatever. One man said his
ancestors had killed off the first owners. Another
declared his ancestors had driven off the second
party. Another man, who seemed to be listened to
With more respect than ordinary, declared that his
ancestor had been the first possessor of all, and had
never been ousted, and that this ancestor was a huge :
lizard that lived in a cave on the land many years
ago —and sure enough there was the cave to prove
it!.... Another claimed because his grandfather had
been murdered on the land, and, as I am a veracious
pakeha, another claimed payment because his grand-
father had committed the murder!” Besides these
were the man who possessed the hereditary right of
catching rats on the land, and the cloud of witnesses
who swore to the presence of a wahi tapu, an ancient
burying-ground, disused some 200 years ago, wfyfere
the bones of their collective ancestors had reposed
until they were removed to a secret burying place in
the hills. Manning eventually bought or shooed off
the mob with the exception of one old chap who,
until his death about a quarter of a century later,
turned up every month or so, demanding payment in
gunpowder and proclaiming himself the wronged and
rightful owner. As a matter of fact, Maori owner-
ship is, or was, tribal rather than individual—a dis-
tinction not easily understanded by the untutored
Pakeha. When I was in Maoriland, some years ago.
the natives were still grieving over the loss of tribal
treasures, offered in a complimentary spirit of homage
to the Duke and Duchess of York and accepted as
presents. A valuable Tiki —to quote another in-
stance —was presented to a lady who had earned
the gratitude of one of the tribes —but it was still
shepherded by the tribe’s representatives, who ex-
pected that, at her death, it should be duly re-
turned. To wander down a side track, the Tiki,
best known from spurious miniatures in jewellers’
windows, is a greenstone image of the god Tiki,
who made man and then knocked off work, and, pre-
sumably, started drinking. The Maori has a well-
filled pantheon, and does not expect any of his gods
to do more than one kind of creation, as well look
to a bricklayer to do a carpenter’s work, he says, as
to expect the same god to make the earth, the trees
and men.
“Marloo”: Byron Bay (N.S.W.) claims
for itself a new long-distance record in death
adders. It previously possessed one which went 2ft.
7in. —half an inch short of the reptile in the Syd-
ney Museum. Warialda had for long the champion-
ship honors, for the Museum specimen had acquired
its length of horror in that region, but Byron Bay
now vaunts itself in the eyes of a whole continent
by being the proud possessor of 3ft. 2in. of torpid
curse. The thing was caught a week or two back
by a local resident called Prince, and it is believed
that even larger specimens exist at the Bay. One
enthusiastic hunter of the native beer and indigenous
rum asserts that he saw a whole herd of dappled
and striped death adders, averaging from eight to
10ft. in length, run like the scriptural swine down
a steep place into the sea. Being a religious man,
he prays several times a day that they may remain
there.
“Iyles Innison”: This is a commonplace
sort of world, but occasionally a little sentimental
incident turns up to elevate us from the mire. For
instance, at Suva, recently, an Indian borrowed a file
from a compatriot to sharpen his knife. And then,
when the blade had a nice keen edge on it, he used
it to cut off the head of the obliging chap who lent
him the file. Which shows how foolish it is to lend
anybody a file. Yet this Suva philanthropist hasn’t
things all his own way. In Sydney, a little while
back, a man, after promising to marry his best girl,
borrowed £5O from her. And when she sued him
for breach of promise, he used the £5O to liquidate
his lawyer's bill. He and that Suva chap ought to
go into partnership and start bookmaking, or pony-
racing, or something similarly sentimental.

“Mr. Ocky” : Just 60 years ago, W.
Howitt, a young Englishman, began to write a rather
interesting book, entitled, “A Boy’s Adventures in
the Wilds of Australia.” He became very much
taken up with our birds. A section of the book is
devoted to them, and the author describes, amongst
others, the peculiarities of the piping crow (mag-
pie), jackass (“only to be heard in perfection in
an Australian wood”), leatherhead (an imitator
which he heard near Kilmore, Vic., but nowhere else,
continually crying “Kilmore! Kilmore!”), carrion
crows (“scavengers”), parrakeets and parrots (“on
which,” he quaintly says, “guns seem to have no
effect”), cockatoos (white, grey and black, the latter
being proclaimers of rain), honey and wattle birds,
plover, lyre-bird, owls, and the much-discussed more-
pork, magpie-lark (he looks upon it as a dove), whip-
bird, razor-grinders (fly-catchers), the robin (“more
gay than the English”), the “superb warbler,” and so
on. One descriptive passage: “I am sitting here at the
foot of a huge gum-tree, surrounded by the golden
splendor of a variety of acacias in flower, while the
parrots and parrakeets glance past me, in their bril-
liant green, and scarlet, and purple, with their sharp,
wiry voices, while the cicada whirrs and the wood-
ericket sings, and a little taunting bird keeps cry-
ing, ‘Give it up! Give it up!’ and whole choruses
of others are chirping exactly like a flock of chick-
ens ; and the leatherhead, in his queer voice, asks
whether I am ‘quite well,’ and the laughing-jackass
seems as if he would laugh me out of my gravity,
and the warbling crow pipes on in a charmingly
grotesque kind of music.” Howitt enjoyed Aus-
tralia. No wonder.

In terror of rows.

And weary eyes gleam
Under tresses of brown ;

“Mongol” writes: —
Re the Japanese physician who attended the late
Emperor, and who, according to the cables, is now
being urged warmly to commit suicide. His case
presents a cruel instance of hard luck. In accordance
with the rules of Japanese Court etiquette, any
doctor who once attends the Emperor is for ever after-
wards debarred from attending anyone else. The
consequence is that the Imperial physician is
one of the most incompetent on earth. He gets no
practice in diagnosing or treating disease, and he
never performs an operation. His medical know-
ledge stays where it was at the stage, perhaps decades
earlier, when he became a Court official. From the
day of his appointment he starts to be a back number
and a fossil. By the way, it is not one medico alone
that will be called on to disembowel himself by our
progressive brown allies. There are 27 doctors in the
Palace, and the fact that the old Mikado couldn’t
live for ever is their funeral—their 27 joint and
several funerals.

The High Court to-day, in the case of an anneal

perform.

has never claimed to be a marvel,

defeat as easily with one arm tied behind
his back and his jaw gagged; in fact, to
Jack Johnson, beauty actors, and persons of
that sort he must appear a horrible mystery.
Having lost the sculling championship, he has
no excuses nor any explanation to offer, save
the obvious one that his conqueror was the
better man. His last words to an interviewer,
the other day, were: “AVliat I intend to do is

The habit of tottering about the edge of
things has become chronic with Richard
Denis Meagher, M.L.A.—the solicitor who

the blunder he made over the Dean case
very long ago. The State Supreme Court
thought hard about re-admitting him more
than once. It was on the brink of doing it
on one occasion, but postponed the matter
till the Nicholas AVillis land troubles were
cleared up. It buried itself in profound
thought again, and Drinked some more, and
decided to really do the deed next time.
Later on it did it, and some months later
the High Court undid the work. Finally
Meagher’s political party came to his aid’
and the Assembly resolved to make him a
solicitor again by Act of Parliament. Now,
by way of a sort of last scene in the drama,
the Upper House —which the Meagher party
was pledged to abolish, but didn’t —has
thrown out the Bill, and the ex-solicitor is
back where he was. So he will, presumably,
brink some more. As a brinker, his luck is
just awful.

Count Robert was invalided early in the abortive
campaign not by the bullets of the enemy, but bv
a wasteful influenza, which tackled four-fifths of the
half-clad and underfed Servian army. The affair
came to an abrupt conclusion, for Servia was half-
hearted m the matter, and Milan’s throne was already
becoming highly insanitary. By the way, Count
Robert went afterwards to Samoa, and there drilled
'varlike chums of Robert Louis Stevenson for
50 dollars a month, and rations. He was the most
nonchalant and cheerful mediatised Austrian prince
1 ever met.
Old Tom Brassey, Victoria’s some-time
Governor, who was perpetually falling off
something or othe r —he
could even fall off his own
feet while on level ground
—is now “Lord Warden of
the Cinque Ports.” As such,
he occupies Walmer Castle,
an interesting and battered
pile near Dover. Under
the rule of his predecessoi’s
in the Wardenship—Lord
Granville, Lord Dufferin,
Lord Salisbury, etc. —the
castle and it grounds were
open to inspection by visi-
tors at certain times. But
Tom apparently does not
like visitors. For three
months he has been leading
a hermit-like existence in
the place, and has flatly re-
fused to answer the knocks
of Yankee touxasts who want
to see the chamber where
the Duke of Wellington
died, and the place where
Mary of Scotland was be-
headed, and the spot where
Ilengist and Horsa landed,
and the apartment where
Macbeth murdereo Duncan,
and the exact locality in the
garden where the Spanish
Armada sank. At latest,
there was talk of getting a policeman or a
beadle or something to break down the door
and see if Brassey had fallen off himself,
and was consequently dead.
Victoria’s ex-inspector of Customs, long,
thin, wiry ,T. M. Christie, was heard of the
other day. He was travelling to his subur-
ban home by a late train, and in a neighbor-
ing compartment were three frisky youths
indulging in horse-play. He stood it for a
while, but as their antics and language were
evidently aimed at him, he presently desired
them to desist. They ignored the request, and
while he was considering the intricacies of
the case, the squashed remains of an orange
hit him in the eye. There was no further
indecision. . Before the well-dressed larri-
kins had time to grasp what was happen-
ing, Methuselah was over the partition and
had handed out enough stoush to last the
trio a month. The rest of the journey was
passed most decorously, while the three won-
dered in whispers who the deuce the “white-
haired old bloke was.”
Gone to the last roll call, Martin Cusack,
alleged to. be the last of the 40th Regiment,
which, with the 12th, engaged in a small
argument against Peter Lalor and co., at
Ballarat, in ’54. Cusack, being an obedient,
unthinking ranker, could never be brought
to see that the diggers were right in “rebel-
ling Also, he thought the rising a folly,
as the diggers “could have no hope against
trained Imperial soldiers.” Which shows
the narrowness of the poor man’s outlook,
tor, in the end, the diggers won everything
they fought for. Cusack died in the Ballarat
Benevolent Asylum, where he had been con-
fined to his bed for 17 years, a loyal but bed-
ridden Imperialist to the last.

THE DRUM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
General Booth’s success was half sincerity; half
drum. —Press comment.
If you aim at High Success,
If you’d rise above the press,
Of the crowd who snap at Fortune’s
Ev’ry crumb,
Sink your books and bookish toil,
Burn no more your midnight oil,
Get abroad—ambitious Brother—
Buy a Drum !
Would you rise within the Church,
Would you gain a lofty perch
Where the busy legal hornets
Daily hum?
In the forum, in the fane,
In the mazes of chicane,
Don’t forget the simple order —
Beat the Drum !
As a babe is led by toys,
So the world is led by noise,
And it cares not for the genius
Who is dumb ;
Ev’ry day with puff is rifer,
And we count the man a cipher
Who is never to the forefront
With the Drum.
What is Glory but a sound,
That a moment rolls around,
Then subsides into the Nothing
Whence we come?
Swing the sticks around your head ;
Recollect—when all is said —
Half the world is just as enr ty
As the Drum ;
Just as empty—and the way
To convince it is to play
On its noddle till its brain is
Out of plumb ;
You must rattle long and loud,
For the man within the crowd
Mostly measures your deservings
By your Drum.
For the mass have small respect
For the flight of intellect,
And the Dregs are filled with envy
Of the Scum ; -
But they always bend and bow
To the paralysing row
Of the Quack who comes before them
With a Drum.

This co. was formed in 1864, and re-incorporated in
1886. From then till the smash in the ’9o’s share-
holders were getting up to 12A p.c. divs. When the
slump came, divs. stopped and none were paid till
last year. The year after the slump (1894) an
issue of £900,000 of debentures was made in
London at 4J p.c., afterwards reduced to 31 p.c.,
making the total debenture debt £994,764. In
1910 the last of the debt was paid off. When bad
times came practically every cent the co. had was
in mortgages. As a result, the co. found itself
loaded with a heap of very much over-valued pro-
perties. There was only one thing to do. The capi-
tal was £250,000 in £5 shares paid to £l. Threp
calls, two of £1 and one of 10s., were made, and
capital was written down to the extent of £2 10s.
a share. Assets were written down to correspond
and the second column in the table represents the
price in excess of the written-down values, which
properties have realised. When the calls were made
104,230 shares were forfeited, and recently 12s. a
share of capital was returned, leaving £58,308 of
capital in the business. The co. is in a very solid
position financially:—

Net assets £192.009 £99,257
Since June, 1911, £87,462 of capital has been
returned; subtract that from the net assets at the
time = £104,546. So the position is much the same.
It will be noted that both mortgages and freeholds
have been very substantially reduced, which is a
sure indication that the co. is hastening its end.
Also, the small quantity of freeholds left on hand
shows that there will not be very much more “Profit
on Property Sales.” The net assets on hand are
now equal to about 13s. 7d. per share. This, with
the 12s. a share recently returned, isn’t anything
like what the shareholders put into the concern, but
under the circumstances they have every reason to
be satisfied, and by the time the end comes the net
value will have grown a bit bigger.
The profits on property sales, by the way, are
mostly guesswork these days. The bank has ceased
to mention exactly what it makes under this head-
ing. When the profit and the dividend are calcu-
lated, and there remains a certain amount which has
dropped into the reserve unaccountably, it is accused
of being profit on sales, there being nothing else to
reasonably accuse it of being. Of course, the
Board may have won it on a horse, but that isn’t
likely.
* * * ♦
Joe Gardiner, Ltd., was formed 12
months ago to take over various Sydney boot-retail-
ing businesses as from August 1, 1911. The paid
capital is £35,000, and the first accounts, lately
issued, show that £6777 of it was represented by
goodwill. Add £ll3B, preliminary exes, and it
appears that the co. started business with £7915 of
its capital represented by nothing that is visible, let
alone wearable. Still, as industrial flotations go,
that isn’t so bad, especially as the leaseholds, which
were probably worth a good deal at the moment,
weren’t valued at anything at all for prospectus
purposes; also, the new co. had the benefit of about
four months’ trading. The profits for the past 12
months (which include the four months just men-
tioned) were £7BOO. Of this amount £3500 (10
p.c.) is paid in divs., leaving a very excellent
£4300 available for the reduction of the goodwill
item, etc. Deducting this from the £7915 men-
tioned above, it will be seen that only £3615 of the
capital is not now represented by tangible assets.
Of the undivided profit, £2574 is, however, trans-
ferred to a special reserve, but whether this reserve
is created on account of any special liability or
contingent liabilitjq doesn’t transpire. The co.’s
debts amount to £24,301, which is on the large
side, and seems to suggest that some more capital
wouldn’t be amiss, especially as it has been decided
to open more branches. Apart from that, and as-
suming that the stock valuation has been done on
safe lines, the thing looks good, and in the matter
of profit-making it has certainly got off the mark
splendidly.

The progress is by no means magnificent. Reserves
are growing, but the progress is very slow, and the
shareholders would do just about as well, and do it
with less worry, smell and risk, if they buried their
money in Government securities. Municipal compe-
tition is their trouble. Launceston is the one up-
to-date municipality in Tasmania. It supplies cheap
electric light to the city and cheap electric power
to the municipal tramways from the swiftly flowing
South Esk River. There isn’t a whole Niagara or
anything of that sort in the South Esk, and even of
what water there is the municipality uses only a
fraction, which it carries to its works by a cheap
and shoddy water race. But the South Esk travels
at a furious pace, like the Snowy River, above Dal-
gety, and quite unlike the sluggish streams about
Canberra ; and the power it is capable of furnishing
is enormous. In this sort of business a pint of
water that is in real haste counts for more than a
big waterhole that is dreaming, with eels on its
bosom, in flat country. With this competitor against
it, the Gas Co. has to toil hard and practise intense-
economy in order to make a crust. Said crust is.
shown in the table above.

The big increase in profits during the past three years
isn’t as gaudy as it looks; nevertheless it is very
satisfactory. Because Victoria hasn’t any coal output
of her own to rely on, she must place all her trust
in Newcastle, and when Newcastle miners strike, Vic-
toria just has to wait while N.S.W. settles the argu-
ment. This is one of the results of refusing the Federal
Government the right to control such matters.
Thus, the profits of 1910 were very much depleted
as the result of the coal strike. Gas sales have
moved on at a great rate. Five years ago sales
stood at £6537. For the 12 months to June, 1912,
they were £10,798. Of course, since 1907, £4113
of new capital (including premiums) has been got
in, thus enabling the co. to extend its mains. Cal-
culated on capital and reserves combined, the gross
revenue has moved this way: 1907, £22 Bs. lOd.
p.c. ; 1912, £3l 2s. Id. p.c.—an increase which is
guaranteed to make shareholders feel much more
pleased than consumers. The financial position is
not all it could be; liquid assets total £2279, lia-
bilities (including an overdraft of £5980) amount
to £6762.
The neglected and unreformed tariff still
works hard to drag the country down. On September
30 the banks of N.S.W. and Victoria held £2,621,817
less gold and £756,743 less Government notes than
they did a year previously, so the total vanishment
of ,liquid assets was £3,378,560. Or it would be
more accurate to say that the gold and Federal notes
held by the banks in N.S.W. have diminished by
£3,554,581, while those held in Victoria have in-
creased by a trifle of £176,021. It is a slump that
may have elements of danger in it. Thus, a year
ago the banks in N.S.W. had £29 14s. sd. in cash
of one sort and another against every £lOO of lia-
bilities, whereas now they have only £23 4s. sd.
As to where the money has gone, that is plain
enough. These are the oversea import and export
records of N.S.W. for the nine months to September
30:—

Therefore, N.S.W. has not only failed during these
nine months to provide a penny towards the interest
on its foreign debts, but it has failed to pay, or any-
thing like pay, for the cheap labor goods it bought.
Yet it has used up its stock of money to a very
serious extent. The trouble has been tided over for
a little while, partly by borrowing as much of the
money of the other States as could be got from the
Australian Government and partly by floating loans
in England on any possible terms. But these re-
sources are limited, and if the pace is maintained,
another year should see N.S.W. in the Bankruptcy
Court. The whole process is a curious case of mov-
ing in a circle. (1) N.S.W. imports foreign goods
to prevent its own people getting employment. (2)
It sends away its own money to pay for these goods
so that there won’t be cash here to finance new en-
terprises, which is another way to prevent its own
people getting employment. (3) Then it borrows money
abroad at high interest, so that it may make employ-
ment for its people at building huge new railways,
which it hasn’t sufficient population to use profitably
—this at a time when the profits of its old railways
are fast fading away. How long does the State Labor
party of N.S.W. and the Foreign trade gang—mostly
from N.S.W.—in the Federal Labor party reckon
that this madness can last—especially in view of the
fact that the gold yield grows smaller every year in
every State?
The Australasian Motor Cab Co. (Syd-
ney) was started early in 1910 to revolutionise
things in Australia; but the revolution hasn’t
amounted to a dog-fight. The paid capital is
£54,303, of which only £25,419 is nominally in-
tact, the balance being made up as follows: Loss
on the business, £20,369; preliminary exes, not
written off, £5710; under-writing commission ditto,
£2805. lor the past year (to June 30) the revenue
was £23,769; expenditure (including £4650 depre-
ciation) was £29,237, leaving a loss of £5468 for
the 12 months. A good many of the expenses are,
however, non-recurring; for instance, the manag-
ing director was bought off for £4OO, and, in view
of the sort of agreement he had with the co., it
seems to have been a cheap purchase. The whole
concern has been reorganised—reorganised to such an
extent, in fact, that it isn’t a taxi-cab business any
loriger, but merely a motor-hiring co. Also, the
dreadful London Board has been finally got rid of,
and Australian directors are now in complete com-
mand. As cash ran out a while ago, some 61 p.c.
debentures were authorised —80 of £5O each —and
when the accounts were made up £l4OO was owing
on that account. Cash and book debts amounted on
June 30 to £1999-; on the other side, apart from
the debentures before mentioned, the co. owed £B9B.
The financial position isn’t, therefore, quite as horri-
ble as the co.’s history. As for the future, the pru-
dent man won’t prophesy ; he will wait to see what
the new management is like.

The N.S.W. Upper House has struck the
Gas Bill on the point by an amendment which pro-
vides for the capitalising of all existing reserves.
There was reason in the amendment. Some com-
panies have transferred reserves to capital, and
others have transferred money paid on capital
account (i.e., premiums on new share issues) to
reserves. So the idea of allowing dividends only on
what is called, capital, and which may be very much
more or a good deal less than the amount which the
shareholders paid in was so lopsided that even an
Upper House was liable to get a lot of popular
approval when it put its foot through it.

This is one of the, many trustee cos. which were
formed in Melbourne in the good times which pre-
ceded the collapse of ’93. It had rather a poor ex-
perience for a while, but has recovered sufficiently to
pay a 7 p.c. div. for the March-September half-year,
making 64 p.c. for the year, and still have £1349
available ‘for reserves. The reserves are now be-
ginning to assume reasonable proportions, although
still only slightly over, one-third of the paid-up capi-
tal ( £30,000). A second bonus of £229 is paid to
the staff. It will be noticed that tlie profits have
shrunk a little, but hot enough _to cause alarm.
However, “Commissions, rents and interest on invest-
ments, and dividend after providing for contingen-
cies,” have advanced from £7982 to £8094_ in 12
months. With these three items lumped in this
way it is impossible to estimate how : much- each
one of them has increased or dropped back.,- The
principal assets are: Advances on mortgages, £ 9811;
advances against beneficiaries’ interests,, £4400;
bank deposits, etc., at valuation, £3BlB ; Victorian
Government Inscribed 3 p.c. Stock, at par, £lO,OOO.
There are also freehold .premises, into which the co.
puts its spare cash, in the hooks at £13,950, and a
heap of cash. Against; this there is a mortgage of
£4950. A year ago it was £5OOO, so in a moment
of abstraction or something £5O has been paid off.
Considering that the heap of cash above hinted at is
£3lBl, it seems a pity the mortgage isn’t driven off
the premises faster. * #

Constant Subscriber: Mining is such a pre-
carious game that we never advise anybody to buy,
though now and then we advise people to sell.
North Broken Hill mine is getting into
the habit of producing over 1000 tons of concen-
trates per week. Last week the stuff assayed 68.4
p.c. lead and 21.40 z. silver, so the co. reckons it re-
covered 684 tons of lead and 21,4000 z. of silver.
The record weekly output is 1050 tons of concentrates
(68 p.c. lead, 220 z. silver) from 5915 tons of ore —
assaying 15.8 p.c. lead, 7.20 z. silver and 13.6 p.c. zinc.
Last half-year, to June 30, the North Co. made a net
profit of £101,172. The output of lead contained in
concentrates was 14,895 tons, and with an average
of £l6 ss. 6d. the profit was nearly £7 per ton of
lead produced. At the moment the output is at the
rate of 16,000 tons of lead per half-year. Allowing
for some increase in costs the net profit should be
over £lO per ton of lead. The North Co.’s contract
for the sale of a dump of slimes to the Junction
North and the sale of zinc tailings to the Amalga-
mated Zinc Co., sustains the revenue. On the
strength of these high prices the North Co. is shell-
ing out 6s. as a quarterly dividend (practically
£240,000 per year).
Chairman Harvey Patterson, at an extra-
ordinary general meeting of the B. 11. Proprietary
Co., said that it might not he necessary to issue all
the 540,000 new shares. The fashionable system of
raising money on debentures, with an option over
some of the new shares, will probably be adopted.
Last half-year’s net profit was £186,883, following
£204,847; total for 12 months, £391,730, which
is more than enough to pay Is. per quarter on
1,500,000 (old and new) shares. The co. will oper-
ate on its big iron property in S. Australia, which
contains a splendid percentage of iron and very little
silica, hut the ore has other peculiarities. Still, the
B. H. Proprietary knows pretty accurately how much
the ore will cost delivered at the Newcastle-works;
also the cost of coal and coke, arid the interest it
will have to pay to the N.S.W. Government for the
concessions granted.

Mount Ross, Copeton (N.S.W.), is open-
ing a tin lead at a depth of 165 ft. The channel is
being attacked from both sides, and less than 90ft.
divides the two drives. The lower tunnel from the.
Ross shaft has been crossing good-looking washdirt,
and the drive from the Deep shaft—so named be-
cause it is the deepest thereabouts—is also showing
wash with a good sample of tin oxide. Prospects run
to 351 b. of tin per ton. There are also diamonds,
hut no information is given as to their value. Some
thousands of small diamonds are unearthed every
year. They are of very low value. Diamond mining,
near Inverell and Copeton, hasn’t been particularly
remunerative, though occasionally a valuable gem
is met with. Still, some valuable diamonds may be
discovered in the deep ground, and washdirt that will
go 351 b. of tin oxide per ton is something to go on
with.

The North Mount Boppy Co, (N.53.W.)
apparently has had no luck With its venture at the
Blue Spec mine, Hargraves, Underground work has
ceased, and the only sign of animation is the crush-
ing of 600 tons at grass. At one time the co. had
prospects of being consoled for its Boppy misfortune,
but present indications point to the unhappy lot of
its wandering mate, the South Mount Boppv.
At the other end of the Hargraves field,
in entirely different country, the Big Nugget leases
are preparing for a prospecting campaign. They are
privately held. The chances have been favorably re-
ported upon. The idea is that saddle-reefs exist, and
if the present attempt is proved successful it will
have a big bearing on the future of the field, which
in 20 years produced over 200,0000 z. of gold. The
field was responsible for Kerr’s Hundredweight,
weighing 1061 b. gold.
Great Cobar (N.S.W.) copper contains
from 6oz. to 7oz. of gold, and from 30oz. to 40oz. of
silver per ton of base metal. The monthly returns
have been:—
Copper, tons. Gold, oz. Silver, oz.
July . . 501 4,575 23,328
August . . 640 3,723 -24,352
September 551 2,502 12,712
1692 10,800 60,392
This shows a lower yield than the June quarter,
which gave 2058 tons of blister copper, containing
14,3970 z. gold and 72,1560 z. silver. Still this big
concern is certainly showing better form, for it has
turned out 3750 tons of blister copper in six months.
Although in its long life Great Cobar (with its sub-
sidiary mines) has produced 100,000 tons of copper,
it has never produced copper more quickly than it has
done during the last half-year. The fact, however,
sticks out that Great Cobar has produced 19,850 tons
of copper since the date of the last dividend (Aug,,
1907). Cobar shareholders are a very hopeful lot,
and shares have kept up in a wonderful way. No
doubt the production of 3750 tons blister copper,
25,1970 z. gold, and 132,5480 z. of silver, in Six
months, is enough to make the shareholders expect
a div.

The Grafton copper mine (N.S.W.) pays a
3d. dividend. The smelters have been treating an
average of nearly 1000 tons of crude ore per month,
for an extraction of from 7 to 9 p.c. copper. Thus
a return last March from 991 tons of ore was
148 f tons of matte, containing 67 tons of copper,
while the September run was of improved quality,
judging by the latest weekly report, which states that
240 tons were smelted for matte containing 21 tons
of copper. Levels are named alphabetically. “A”
level is in 1446 ft. in hard ground, and has recently
developed a fairly good shoot of ore, and the manager
reports that, on opening out, there is an excellent
stoping width of clean sulphide ore. The mine has
been developed by tunnelling into the hill, and the
ore is trucked to the works from the deepest tunnel.
There are 80,000 shares, so the 3d. dividend costs
£2OOO.

After a struggling existence of over 17
years, Menzies Consolidated (W.A.) is believed to be
nearing the dividend stage. It was originally floated
in London with a cash working capital of £50,000,
and when all this had been used up an additional
£25,000, or thereabouts, was raised by means of
debentures. To date it has produced nearly
£600,000, but not one penny of this has been re-
ceived by shareholders. Working costs are still
high, but recently improved returns have enabled the
co. to show a small profit.
* * * *
A Melbourne concern known as the Nor’-
west Syndicate, has optioned the North Pole, near
Marble Bar (W.A.). Some high-grade copper ore
has been extracted from this show, and samples for-
warded to the Whim Well Co. for assay are alleged
to have averaged 23 p.c. A shaft is down 50ft., and
the Width of the reef is given as 22ft. Judgment
is reserved pending further inquiries.

“For reasons repeatedly given,” no posi-
tive estimate of ore reserves is attempted by the gen-
eral manager of the Kalgurli in his current annual re-
port. Two years ago he gave 400,000 tons as the
probable resources without stated grade, and during
the 12 months following 127,010 tons were raised
and treated for a return of £299,619, or an average
of 475. 2d. per ton. Since then the grade has been
reduced to a little under 40s. per ton, and although
some of the working faces in the higher levels still
show up well, the condition of the mine at depth
leaves much to be desired in the matter of payable
tonnage. As an indication of resources, the manager
t,h : nks that it is quite safe to place the profitable ore
that should result from present development at
250,000 tons. Meantime the mine is being worked
on safe lines, by which the grade is governed by a
regular system of ore extraction from every level,
none of which has yet been depleted.
Long ago back numbers of this paper
sounded the death-knell of Moolyealla tin field
(W.A.), to the accompaniment of local dissent. Now
a Government geologist, who has just returned from
that outlandish locality, reports: “There is little to
record about this centre nowadays. Half a dozen
prosoectors are dryblowing the old worked-out
gullies, and a few natives with their gins are doing
the same thing. Sluicing and puddling gully
tailings have been tried, but with little success.
Apparently, a gentle push is all that is needed to
send it down and out.” Of the low-grade gold con-
glomerates at Nullagine, which made a London co.,
promoted by A. E. Morgans, nearly bankruot, the
same expert says: “Judging from what could be seen

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“the Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.

of the abandoned workings, little, if any, legitimate
development has ever been done to prove the real
extent and value of these deposits That a con-
siderable sum has been spent in development is evi-
dent, but, apparently, with little, if any, system.”
The aid of the best mining practice and adequate
capital is needed to give a show working these con-
glomerates any reasonable hope of success, and the
mere fact of one having tried and failed makes it
doubly difficult to get another to tackle the job.
The deposits are secondary, but there is an immense
tonnage in sight.

Frank Moss, formerly boss of the Kalgurli
and Hainault, and now heavily interested in Green-
bushes tin and the Sand Queen, returns to the West
from other parts of the world at the end of this
month. One yarn is that he is coming back to make
preliminary arrangements for the flotation of a group
of Greenbushts snows in London, while another is
that it is the Sand Queen that is to be got rid of in
this way. So far, the latter property has produced
£83,000, and paid something over £6OOO in divi-
dends. An attempt was made some time back to
amalgamate it and the adjoining Gladsome lease,
which has yielded nearly £70,000, and sell them to
a “ ’Ome” co., but a hitch occurred, and the deal
consequently fell through.
The almost friendless Bullrush Co. (W.A.)
announces that 54in. of 58s. 6d. ore has been
struck 450 ft. from the crosscut at the 170 ft. level, in
the Royal Standard mine. For the last 90ft. the
drive has been in valueless stuff, and the discovery
of values at the point mentioned gives rise to the
official belief that a new lens of ore has been found.
The drive is to be continued to prove the extent of
the new shoot, and also to prove the continuation of
another one found by the original owners some years
ago in an open cut 300 ft. further east.
Having found signs of payable reefs, the
Adelaide Kurnalpi Option Syndicate has hurriedly
purchased the Havilah at Binti Binti (W.A.). The
show may promise to be successful, but in these days
of deception the public should look very carefully
before they leap into any net spread by any co.
formed for the purpose of acquiring any Westralian
mine. A clear and definite report by someone whose
opinion is worth having is wanted) and should be
insisted on first.
The Westralian Full Court gave reserved
judgment the other day in a very important ease de-
fining the meaning of a clause in the dividend duties
Act. which makes liable to duty of Is. in the £ all
dividends, profit, advantage or gain accruing during
any year. The Government sued Swan Brewery Com-
pany for dividend duty on £101,430 reserve fund
which company had transferred to capital account by
issuing new shares to present shareholders paid up
to £1 ss. The Chief Justice, in delivering judg-
ment, said that decision of Court was the simple
question, “Did the transaction amount to declaration
of dividend?” He thought it did. Judgment en-
tered for the Government for £5072 and interest at
7 p.c. In his last report the Com. of Taxation said
that local cos. frequently refrained from declaring
dividends, even when, apparently, in a position to
do so. Estimated that £400,000 of profits made by
cos. in that State is thus annually made exempt
from taxation.
The case of the Sandstone G.. M. Co.
(W.A.) serves to show how useless balance-sheet
figures can be, when they try hard enough. In the
co.’s accounts to March, 1912, appears this item.:
Plant and machinery ( £10,884), less depreciation
( £1089), £9795 ; which, of course, leads share-
holders to believe that the plant is actually worth
over £9OOO, and would bring something like that if
it were sold. The Sandstone hasn’t been feeling too
well lately, and has decided to die. This is how
the directors put it: “Your directors.... after nego-
tiations with 8., M. and Co., acting for the Oroya-
Black Range have agreed to 5e11.... the leases, plant,
etc., for £l/000. Shareholders will note that in the
last balance-sheet, plant stood at £9705, but....the
sale Of second-hand machinery, especially during a
time of depression as exists at present in W.A., is
very difficult.” Then why the deuce, if the direc-
tors knew that the plant would not bring the book
value, didn’t they write it down. From £9795 to
£40,00 is a big drop, and the leases and etc. are
being thrown in. So it is up to some shareholder
to ask “Whaffor?” Cash in hand at March, 1912,
was £1644 ; possibly it is much less now. So share-
holders are not likely to gather up 12 basketsful
of crumbs.
A contract has been let at Mount' Oxide
(Cloncurry, Q.) to continue the north drive
at the 208 ft. level. This level has been ex-
tended to 188 ft., with a face of ore lift,
in width, bulking 35 p.c. copper. There is,
according to the official report, 66in. of ore on the
hanging wall that assays 49-J p.c., while the other
66in. (making a total of lift.) assay 20 p.c.. so the
general average is a shade under 35 p.c. The tele-
gram goes on to say that the north drive looks re-
markably well, and no doubt it does, if there is 66in.
assaying nearly half copper. Still, there is only 61
tons of high-grade ore on hand, and in the past a
good deal of hand-picking has been done to bring the
ore up to first grade. There are 3000 tons of
second-grade ore at the mine, which is a moderate
quantity, considering the length of time it has been
accumulating.

Blair Athol Coal Co. (Q.), which missed
its usual quarterly sixpenny dividend in August,
has just broken the silence with one of 3d. On the
basis (6d. on 75,000 shares) its dividends ate up
£7500 a year. The new order of things (3d. on
100,000 shares) will only equal £ 3330-odd, especi-
ally if the 3d. puts in an appearance only every 41
months, which was the time taken to hatch the last
one. An option for £llO,OOO was recently offered
over the co., but the shareholders turned the pro-
posal down.
Tommy Burns, the rich North Queensland
surface tin show, has a small punch still left.
Floated in 1908, it got off the mark quickly, and in
1909 paid £l2 per £l2- 10s. share. Not that the
Southerner got many shares at £l2 10s. The simple
Northerner mopped them up at - par, and on the
strength of the boom divs. passed them on at a big
premium. After the rich surface stone was taken
out Tommy became the usual second- or third-rater ;
1910 and 1911 passed entirely without divs., and this
year has seen only another £2 per share. Present
prospects are, however, very fair. The co. has
bought and paid for a winding plant, etc.—part of
the old Smith’s Creek wreckage—and it looks as
though there might be a few divs. in the deeper
workings if the tin market keeps good. Last half-year’s
profit was £1686, and there was just about enough
cash and liquid assets in hand to square liabilities
when the accounts were made up in September.
Brilliant Deeps (Charters Towers) has
been following a strong reef from sft. to 6ft. thick,
in No. 5 level, but there is ISin. of lightly mineral-
ised and poor stone in the centre of the reef. The
rise above No. 5 level, which will join the new
underlie shaft, is also showing stone for the full
width, and the stone is showing a little gold. This
may be comforting, but the last crushing of 376 tons
averaged £5 17s. 3d. and the tendency seems to be
downward. For the half-year to September 14, B.
Deeps crushed 1175 tons for £8328. The cost of the
new hauling plant and the development work has
taken all the spare cash and left a small overdraft.
Dividends will drop in after a time.
* * * *
Papuan Brilliant and Victoria (Charters
Towers) has cleaned up 212 tons for £785, from' its
Moonstone lease. The half-year closed on September
13 with a credit of £403. During the six months
361 tons were crushed for £902.
New Brilliant Freehold (Charters Tow-
ers) hands out another sixpenny, raising the total
dividends this year to 3s. per share (£22,500).
This year to the end of September, 14,261 tons have
been crushed for gold worth £40,483. The re-
serves are not so strong as they used to be, for,
with the exception of No. 5 west, there has been
no development of much consequence for some time
past. No. 5 west, at 343 ft. from the shaft, had sft.
of well mineralised stone in the face, and the stopes
overhead carry from Ift. to 3ft. of fair stone. The
last fortnightly return was 747 tons for £l6Bl, fol-
lowing 734 tons for £l5Bl, which cannot leave a
large margin of profit. Costs at Charters Towers are
seldom much below £2 per ton. The upper crust of
this 'reef is in the East Mexican, but that co. has
had a poorer reef in its upper levels.
Stanthorpe (Q.) is excited over a dis-
covery of tin about 24 miles distant, near Ballandean
Siding. The deposit, which occurs at the junction of
granite and “trap,” is reported to be rich and of
large dimensions, the width being 50ft. to 60ft. in
places. The lode has only been worked to the depth
of a few feet, but the outcrop has been tested for
about 300yds.
It is said that Ilampden-Cloncurry is to
be introduced to the Paris Bourse, which already
knows something of Mount Elliott. No doubt the
cabled return for September made a favorable im-
pression. It was due to the improved running of
the converters, which, in addition to the current out-
put from the furnaces, treated 737 tons of accumu-
lated matte. To maintain a return of 721 tons of
copper per month the furnaces would require to treat
much larger quantities of 11 p.c. ore than they have
hitherto done. Last month 4335 tons were smelted.
* * * *
From the Duchess mine some 100 tons
are being railed 59 miles to the smelter per day. At
No. 1 (110 ft. level) and No. 2 (260 ft.) friable
ore is being mined; while No. 3 (400 ft.) and No.
4 (550 ft.) provide hard bornite ore, and rock drills
are used. At a point 224 ft. north of the shaft a
winze has been sunk from No. 1 to No. 2 level, right
in the heart of a rich shoot of copper ore. Still
further north, at the 110 ft. level, the lode is very
erratic. At 302 ft. the assay was 22 p.c. copper. At
306 ft. it was p.c. copper.
* * * *
Mount: Elliott (Queensland) has declared
a dividend of 10s. ( £73,759). Since the present
plant made a start (September, 1910) the intermit-
tent running has given 12,200 tons of blister copper
from less than 100,000 tons of ore. The output is now
helped by regular shipments of ore from the Hamp-
den Consols, which is providing metal-bearing flux
that makes it easy to treat Elliott’s oxidised ore.
For three months the return was 2010 tons of copper,
36090 z. gold, and 36770 z. silver from 16,961 tons of
ore. Still Elliott is doing so much exploratory and
development work on outside mines that the monthly
bill of costs must be very heavy.
William’s Fancy, Berringa (Vic.), is
tipped to stay on the div. list for a while. If so, a
low-grade centre is sure to claim a bit of attention
again. Few claims can pay like those at Berringa,
where 4dwt. means a meal and sdwt. cross words
with the barmaid. Take the past four returns:
3dwt. 9gr., 4dwt. 3gr., 4dwt. 14gr. and 4dwt. 7gr.
To mine at 600 ft., do development work and pay
divs. on dirt of that grade is a feat that would
make the sceptic want to be sure of the weight of
the ton measure did he not know how things went.
At the 600 ft. level, after payable stone bad been
proved for over 200 ft., mullock cut in and the hopes
of the field cut out. Now the mullock has gone, and
a full face of quartz is showing, with nearly 200 ft.
to go before the next series of the zig-zag breaks is
reached. Since Birthday Tunnel has passed into re-
tirement, Berringa has not had a better-looking
shoot of stone exposed than that now developed at
the Fancy.
In the days of the Star of the East and
the South Star, Sebastopol Plateau was a sport and
a gamble. When the Star shut up owing to poverty
at depth, the water swamped out two mines adjoin-
ing, and it looked as -if work on the Sebastopol
Plateau was ended. But the co. got a new shaft
going, and opening yields from the lode gave 106ioz.
from 196 tons. One of the features of the group of
mines to which the Plateau depends, however, is
that they often flutter and then fail. It is nice to
read that north, at the 600 ft. level, exists a highly
payable shoot, and that “a large body of payable
stone is_ showing in the face.” These generalities
want fining down, a la Rain of the North Nuggetty.
Equally cheerful would it be to learn that there is
upwards of 1600 ft. of virgin ground north to the
boundary if the market did not estimate its value as
worth well under half a sov. There must be a bit of
a smudge somewhere. Anyway, the battery will soon
rattle out • the truth about this resurrected Plateau,
and it will be judged, not on a preliminary spin of
400 or 500 tons, but on a year’s good work.
* * * *
A sale of slimes for £6lOO, by the Burnt
Creek, Maryboro’ (Vic.), helps another alluvial dead-
beat on to the dividend list. This co. made a manful
try w,jien opening on to the Bet Bet lead to return
a shade of the capital that has been pouring into its
works. Costs, under the eye of Jimmy McCrorev
and a non-swearing member of the ’Varsity profes-
sional Board, constituted pretty well a low record for
Victorian mines. But the water was too heavy and
the bottom too cemented for the claim to hit up a
score. By working on the Duke gutter, below the
Duke and Main Leads, Burnt Creek, now has a fam
extent of wash drained. This enables the run of
blobs, dating from 1903, to be broken. All the same,
the unwary must, count in the curly ones got from
the slimes dump if he wants to reckon up whether to
cling to Creeks or sell on the present flutter.
Great Southern, Rutherglen (Vic.), is at
last beginning to reward with occasional sprats
those who have stuck to it with empty pockets for
the past five years. During the greater part of that
time the gutter has beep in a wide reach, and the
gold has been just about’ sufficient to keep the wolf
from the door. Now it can also add a seasonable
bonus for the sports on the Board to cover their an-
nual flutter in Tatt.’s tickets. This disbursement is
possible because of an enrichment of the gutter en-
abling yields to be got, the like of which have not
been heard of in Rutherglen for years. Incidentally,
this turn for the better is helping on those who are
financing John Cock’s old mine, the Chiltern Valley,
in the hope that work at No. 3 shaft will also bring
a hatful of profits to a plucky crowd.
The importing craze was given a long
overdue set-back last week by the Victorian
Government. Some little time back the
Melbourne University applied for an endow-
ment to establish a Chair of Economics and
Sociology, and the Government applied a
friendly ear to the application. But it put a
tag to its friendliness, that an Australian
should be given preference when the appoint-
ment was being made. The Council of the
University hurriedly interjected that it was
beyond the bounds of belief that any Austra-
lian would be in the same paddock as a
foreigner of some kind, or words to the same
effect. Whereupon the Watt Government
plugged its friendly ear, locked the cash-box,
and remarked that there would be no busi-
ness done until the Council scraped some of
the prejudice off its ideas. The Council is
understood to be reluctantly looking for the
scraper.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
“0.K.”: Viewed on “paper,” by one who
was far outside the Kandwick radius at the time, the
results of the A.J.C. meeting give more than one
strong tip for the Melbourne Cup. Duke Foote is
the conspicuously, well-handicapped animal that has
not yet been tested over a longer distance than 12
furlongs, but has always finished like a stayer.
Hallowmas is less conspicuously well handicapped,
but has won over lj miles at the first time of ask-
ing, and is, to all appearances, a genuine stayer.
On the second day of the A.J.C. meeting the English
horse surprised his owner by winning the Squatters’
Handicap from end to end of the 10 furlongs. He
stayed in front all the way, and though said to be
“hard pushed,” he won by half a length from Zilper,
who beat Sunlike by the same distance. Well,
Zilper and Sunlike confirmed their form of the
Monday when they ran first and second for the Final
Handicap on the Saturday. This same Zilper had
been beaten, on the third day, by Shuja and Muti-
lator over a 12 furlongs, but when this pair met
Hallowmas in the Waverley Handicap (14 furlongs'!
the English horse beat them. This time he didn’t
run a tear-away race. Hallowmas was behind Ber-
nard (another imported one) most of the time, and
after heading him in the straight he lost ground, ap-
parently beaten. But at the very finish Hallowmas
jumped to the fore and beat Bernard by half a length.
He carried 7st. 71b., the same as his weight for the
Melbourne Cup, including his penalty. On paper he
has an undeniable fair chance, which may be a
great chance if he was not thoroughly wound up
when he battled so bravely with Bernard. W. H. Smith
could ride him at the weight, and if he does, the
five-year-old Hallowmas is not to be sneezed at. The
book suggests that he has only just begun to be
thoroughly acclimatised.
The results of the Eclipse Stakes on Octo-
ber 16, which Lady Medallist won so handsomely, and
the Caulfield Cup on October 19, wherein the popular
mare ran a rattling second with 9st 31b. on her
back, should certainly have moved the V.A.T.C.
stewards to demand a reasonable explanation of her
shocking failure in the Caulfield Stakes race on Oc-
tober 12. Royal Scotch ran consistently enough on
the three days of the Caulfield meeting. The bad-
tempered Eudorus ran consistently each time he
met Royal Scotch. But Lady Medallist 1 Her per-
formances subsequent to winning the October
Stakes (10 furlongs) at Flemington, shriek for ex-
planation.
Caulfield Stakes (nine furlongs)..—Royal Scotch,
9st., won easily; Mousme, Bst. 91b., second; Eudorus,
9st. lib., third ; Lady Medallist, Bst. 131 b., sixth.
Caulfield Cup (12 furlongs).—Lady Medallist, 9st.
31b., second; Royal Scotch, 7st. 91b., third; Eudorus,
Bst. 71b., fourth.
And, in the meantime, the mare, carrying Bst. 131 b.,
had won the Eclipse Stakes (11 furlongs). No ex-
cuse was offered for her defeat on the previous Satur-
day. It is left to stand as one of the inglorious un-
certainties of the turf.
Uncle Sam—of whom this paper remarked that
he had nothing to fear from a penalty for win-
ning the Toorak Handicap—scored his fifth succes-
sive win when he strode home for the Caulfield Cup.
The whip was on Uncle when he tackled the
top weight, with 251 b. advantage, but he never fal-
tered, and probably a few pounds more on his back
would not have stopped his masterful rush. Lam-
bert, who rode the brawny chestnut in preference to
his stable companion, Flavian, handled him very
judiciously, and will doubtless take the same mount
in the Melbourne Cup. The 101 b. penalty will bring
Uncle up to 7st. 61b. only. If trainer Whitty can
keep him bright and lusty during the intervening 17
days, the honest nag will go very close for the two
miles race. All the same, Lady Medallist, meeting
Uncle on 81b. better terms, should have a chance, for
she looks capable of improvement, and seems to have
gained stamina since last year. Melbourne Cup is
no longer a “one horse race” on paper. Duke Foote
has at least a couple of dangerous rivals.
The art of training such as Uncle Sam for
big races lies in keeping them in good work
without “stringing ’em up,” as (Say) Wilari was
strung before she broke a blood-vessel. Uncle’s coat
shone on Caulfield Cup day, but he wasn’t “a mass
of muscle” or “hard as nails.” He carried a fair
amount of flesh, and sweated somewhat on his big
barrel after the race. Nevertheless, he was soon as
dry as the proverbial bone on his quarters, where
the big effort had come from, and will not need to
be made any fitter for the Flemington job. Of
course there is always a fear of a return of the
rheumatism that occasionally crippled Uncle Sam in
his three-year-old days. The touts will look for the
suspicion of a limp.
“A very open race” was Mr. Mo’s catch term
re the Caulfield Cup after Duke Foote had been
scratched and Wilari had ,bled at the nose, and
Royal Scotch had developed a mysterious trouble
in his hoof, which seemingly was not so much cracked
as cracked about. “Anything might win,” said the
bookmakers. They said it by way of encouraging
punters to put their faith in outsiders, rough or
otherwise. The gag passed from mouth to mouth,
and the guileless public backed 11 horses at any-
thing between 12 and 25 to one, not to mention an-
other dozen rank outsiders. Yet the race at the
business end of it was a mere picnic for the favorites.
The Melbourne newspapers, with hardly an excep-
tion, had confined their tippings to the four placed
ones, and they were dead on the mark. ' The order of
the betting was Eudorus, Royal Scotch, Uncle Sam,
Lady Medallist, Golden Point. Aurofodina, an
eleventh hour commission from Clark and Robinson,
in England, sufficing to put their English-bred
Eudorus at the top of the market. And the order of
finishing was: Uncle Sam, Lady Medallist, Royal
Scotch, Eudorus and Golden Point; the sixth favor-
ite, Aurofodina, having been the actual leader into
the straight.
The running of Royal Scotch (on his cracked heel)
confirms the merit Qf Artesian’s victory in the
Coongy Handicap, where he beat the Maoriland flier.
Artesian weighted at Bst. only for the Melbourne
Cup, and with a proved character for staying, is one
of the probabilities of the two-miles test. This
writer fancies Duke Foote, Uncle Sam, Lady Medal-
list, Artesian and Hallowmas for Melbourne Cup, and
will pick one out of that bunch next week.
* * * *
Understood that the operations of Patrick
Iscariot, at both Randwick and Caulfield, showed a
deficit of quite unusual proportions, and to-day Brian
O’Galilee is looking forward with boundless confi-
dence and a cunning eye to a long succession of win-
ning outsiders during the four days at Flemington.
Nor is the Melb. Cup excluded from the vision of
his sure and certain hope. Duke Foote, who three
weeks before the race almost touched Revenue’s
starting price (less than two to one), will be steered
by W. Manning or “Bobby” Lewis, his pilot in the
Metrop.; Ernest Clarke being likelv to release
Robert from the contract to ride Eye-glass if Brown
wishes. But even though the Sir Foote nag gets
going, the last words to three or four mannikins on
certain mokes that can hang on for a mile and a half
are not certain to be, “Give the Duke a clear run!”

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, October 21, 1912.
My Dear Arini. —
The man AVill Shakspeare is again the
storm centre of a local argument. The col-
umns of the daily press are rent with fierce
discussion as to whether William was him-
self, half a dozen other persons, a money-
lender with a loud reputation, or plain
Bacon. The proposed memorial to the al-
leged bard of Avon, which was aired in the
Town Hall the other day, is the cause of this
raging controversy. An informative corres-
pondent, in one morning paper, is nrimed to
his eyelids with adverse comment, and dis-
misses the idol of Stratford’s American tour-
ists as “an illiterate clown,” and a mean-
minded person who left his second-best bed
to his wife.
The wealthy Eadith Walker took a hand
in the Shakspeare financial flurry, by
promptly removing her purse out of harm’s
way (as an adjunct to the memorial) and
coldly remarked that the funds would be bet-
ter spent in cleaning up our dirty streets.
The gigantic brain of man fails to recognise
the feminine attention to detail in this posi-
tion. A woman wants to char, and set her
house in order, before she plunges into the
china shepherdess business, or hammers her
thumb hanging the ancestral photos. A
man will cheerfully distribute his muddy
boots on a freshly-scrubbed floor, or hang up
his feet on a laundered cushion. Behind the
Eadith Walker digression there is a sound
notion that a nice, clean piece of Carrara
marble, for instance, is at present liable
to lose its effect, if the frequent garbage tin
staggers in the adjacent gutter.
The clothes worn by the Rupert Clarke lady
in race week, were the topics of breathless
whispers in the Sacred Horsey of Horsey—
the members’ stand. They looked like for-
eign goods of the Very Last gasp of fashion,
and mostly followed the magpie blend. A
black gown that trailed its light, serpen-
tine undulations round the wearer’s form
seemed to have a large knot in the middle
of its tail. There was nothing like it for
Style on the lawn, and the X-ray glances of
the Rich Hundred fixed a stony glare on
its evolutions till the dame and her baronet
retired to a seat on the outwork of the
members’ grass plot. Then a black parasol,
a small, steep, pagoda-shaped dream in chif-
fon, made an impenetrable wall between the
Clarke lady’s bronze head, and the bleat of
our Sheepocracy.
Miss Madeline King is just back from a
three months inspection of heathen habits in
darkest Papua. She’s been studying Fuzzy
Wuz and his out-door dress —chiefly cocoa-
nut oil cut low, and dog’s-teeth necklets, cut
on a bias —with a sketch block, and means to
illustrate his casual ways in a book. The
writer, by the way, is the head of the Angli-
can mission in these parts, and the letter-
press may, or may not, be lop-sided in its
estimate of converted cannibals. Miss King”
is alleged to have returned to this township,
engaged. As a matter of fact, the Nice Girl
who can escape from a tropic islet without a
few scalps is an unknown quantity.
Australia’s Dr. Morrison and his new
wife were booked to spend part of their
honeymoon in Constantinople, before return-
mg to China. This arrangement was ac-
cording to schedule, before the Balkan war
spark had .brought about the long-threat-
ened explosion. Morrison, however, is so
well informed on Europe’s tinder-heap that
it is likely he arranged to be present in the
ot Lost Dogs while the Unspeakable
lurk was having the time of his life with
his neighbors.
Charles Albert Elvy, a relative of the
music-warehouse family, is going to be mar-
ried, on October 26, to Miss Edith Webster,
ot this congested city of hereabouts.
Who is the W. G. Adams, of Goulburn,
who is cycling over the map of England v
And when will he be back?
Portland (N.S.W.), where the Common-
wealth officially grows cement, teemed with
editors and managers who manage large
commercial concerns, and a heavy consign-
ment of Important Persons, the other day.
l)r. Scheidel, a social star of some magni-
tude in his spare moments, was in charge of
the cement party, as a solid official corner-
stone of the Portland works. The Clielms-
tords took a growing-up daughter to this in-
structional outing, and the frequent ML A
who is becoming an alarming luxury in the
btate, was audibly present.
Members of the Women’s Club, now
skyed on the sixth floor of Stanway House,
gave themselves a warm welcome home the
other afternoon. The McMillan dame, presi-
™ Vi n the c , ommi ttee, being elsewhere, Mrs.
MacCallum lent her aid to the decorative
tea party. The dais in the main sitting-
room will throb with informative remarks on
one afternoon a week, but the bun of peace
will always be unmolested in the large din-
The new Women’s Club is spacious and
well furnished. Flangings mostly run to
blue and brown. The cretonne chair covers
in one retreat will tone down to a mild-
mannered displav of printed foliage, when
the heaviest members of the club have sat
on their patterns for a year or two An
automatic lift of the very latest and swiftest
design is still treated with distant respect
by timid elderly dames. An unreliable
rumor says, on the worst authority, that
one of the most thrilling spectacles which
followed the pressure of a wrong button in
this handsome machine was the expression
of a policeman who within half an instant
shot eight storeys to the roof, and was thrown
six feet into the atmosphere by way of dis-
count. When he found his feet on the tiles
after rebounding six or eight times, and
falling heavily on the establishment’s best
sky cat he firmly walked down the
mile or so of staircase, and fled
the premises. Even the best old
ladies in the club don’t want to go
bodily to Heaven before their time,
and a wretch informs me that they
stalk the automatic flying machines in
Gourdes. One traveller closes her eyes, and
suddenly bumps a button, while the other
bolds tier disengaged hand and prays for
help.
In the flurry of snatching some clematis
off its native soil, to decorate the Women’s
Club house-party the other day, a small nest
with two little eggs tucked in its fluffy in-
terior was indavertentlv dragged away and
added to the spoils. Will Mrs. Wren please
remove her property before the Bird Society
arranges for a clematis-picker’s funeral?
The Admirable King-Hall is to be suc-
ceeded on Australian waters by Rear-
Admiral Erskine. This country has no
knowledge of Erskine’s previous convictions,
but it expects that he will do his duty, as
Nelson remarked to Columbus when he pur-
sued Hannibal across the Alps.
_ “United Charities” Saturday is a poor rela-
tion of Hospital Saturday. It gives the
man in the street a second chance of swell-
ing with joy over a well-spent copper. But
the attack of the “United Charities” on the
public purse is only a far-off echo of the
dash and daring of the charming brigands
who pile up cash on Hospital Saturday.
The beauties of the “Charities” fund must
have been mostly laid low by the prevailing
’flu. A small percentage of anything calcu-
lated to raise half a crown for the Cause, by
the quality of its smile, or its outrageous
devotion to fashionable boots, patrolled this
city on Saturday. One sad-eyed collector,
who sagged in the skirt, told a portly citi-
zen that her only reward would occur in
another world. He gave her sixpence to go
on with. Other ladies collected more than
h" lr > , 's, for the total hangs fire at, or about,
£2OOO. ' **,l
Curator Maiden’s family of pretty daugh-
ters lost another of its rosebuds the other
day. when the eldest girl was married to Dr.
J. T. Paton, of Blackheath. The bridal train
was followed to the altar by three handsome
damsels, Doris Paton and Nellie and Doro-
thy Maiden. The bridal plumage showed a
generous helping of Limerick lace—an epi-
demic at orange-blossoms parties this season.
So much youth and beauty hung round the
Paton-Maiden wedding bells that compari-
sons can only be fired off at a safe distance.
Mollie David, in a wonderful silk garment
that shot green, gold and crimson lights
through its shimmering drape, was as hand-
some as any other maiden present, and that’s
as far as a cautious pen and a precautionary
ink-bottle dare to go. Dr. Vance supported
the ’groom, and two-thirds of the local Pill
and Porous Plaster brigade were present.
The Australian Dr. F. Goldsmith, who is
mentioned in the cables as just off to the
Balkan flare-up, is probably the well-known
Adelaide man of that name. He is a clever
surgeon, and gifted with more than the aver-
age weight in brains, but the wander-thirst
runs in his veins, and he can’t settle down
with a brass plate and a motor for any
stretch of time. He made heaps of friends
up Chatswood way during a settled interval
of stethescopic inquiry in that region. But
he broke away from his moorings to scatter
himself off to the tropics. Red Cross ambu-
lance work, with bullets whizzing through
the lurid atmosphere, will fit the Goldsmith
love of strange places without a crease.
The Lebbeus Hordern-Olga Monie wedding
caused a traffic-blocking crowd to stamp up
to the steps of St. Mary’s Cathedral the
other morning. The going-away motor was
like a small rose garden glassed in and'
mounted on rubber tyres. Nothing under the
rank of a fairy princess in an unreliable
chronicle by Grimm or Hans Anderson has
ever glided off to be “happy ever after” in
such a glorified chariot. The bridesmaidens
were Molly Barry. Gwenda Monie, Kath-
leen Baxter and Norah Floyd. Our most
experienced Society maidens let the richest
young man in Australia slip through their
eyelashes. The simple suburban maiden, who
is merely young and pretty, is acquiring a
habit of annexing the best matrimonial
stakes of the season. Meanwhile, the damsel
whose clothes and society gear cost a steady
stream of gold, frequently trips to the altar
with an impecunious naval gun of no special
tonnage.. These problems are already haunt-
ing curling-time, I’m told, in some of our
most expensive homes.
Dr. Cowan, late surgeon of the Makura,
has been chosen as Health Officer to the
Tongan Government. Probablv it is the
best streak of luck that has happened to the
Tongan Government up to date.
The new Governor Liverpool, who pro-
poses to reign over the M.L. Dominion, is
coming this way by the P. and O. Malwa.
He will probably leap ashore in this port
and have a hurried look at our deep-water
frontage before he unpacks his feathered
toque and prepares to meet the Wellington
police, politicians and resident gentry, also
the public debt, and the unpublished debt
which is kept in the background because it
is too terrible for inspection.
Mr. George Dunnett and his wife (of
Auckland) have been inhaling the munici-
pal dust in this town for some weeks or
thereabouts. They return by the Makura
to their native rainfall. Dunnett was senior
partner in the veteran shipping firm of Hen-
derson and Macfarlane. The firm’s house
flag, a circular saw, was seen in the South
Seas long before the advent of steam.
Cambridge has been absorbing colored
morals by proxy, at the lips of a traveller
named Di\ Gunnar Landtman, a lecturer
in sociology in Helsingfors Uni., Finland.
Landtman l'ecently spent two years in
Papua. He discovered cannibal hockey, and
firmly refxised a large consignment of wives,
offered to him as a token of esteem by the
ladies’ husbands. Landtman is also writ-
ing a book about _ Governor Murray’s dusky
subjects, so Beatrice. Grimshaw will have to
polish her bxilliant nib for fi’esh sensations in
alligator tails. She still camps at Port
Moresby.
A young Englishwoman, who lately ap-
plied to the Marylebone Court for a separa-
tion order from her husband, gave the Bench
such a complete list of outrageous acts com-
mitted and things thrown that I am sure
she must have kept a private day-book and
entered them carefully to his account. The
fact of being dragged downstairs might have
stayed in her memory without assistance;
but how, save by keeping a diary, could she
have remembered that the saucepan he threw
contained boiling water and three eggs? In
the midst of a life that seems to have been
all kicking and dragging by the hair, trifles
like three eggs would have been easily for-
gotten. The fact that he missed her with
the alarm clock was another incident of
slight importance which was carefully re-
corded. So was the occasion when he bit her
—and yet the nobility in the Hungarian
Parliament bite each other now and then.
But, of course, even a forgetful woman
might remember being bitten, especially if
she was bitten on a Friday and it happened
to be the 13th of the month.
There’s more fresh air than finance in
the average bird-man’s outfit. Australian
flying-man, Charles Lindsay Campbell, who
was killed at Brooklands (Eng.), not long
ago, left £24 as his share of this planet’s
goods. The Daily Mibeoe is appealing for
funds for Campbell’s wife and two chil-
dren.
Have you noticed the tallish hat, like a
bashed flower-pot, with a lax-ge slice of satin
binding its crown, after the manner of a
wide bandage? This is considered the cor-
rect head-gear for the morning shopper, I’m
told, but it’s neither cheap nor beautiful.
And you don’t get any reduction on the
goods through wearing it.
Mrs. Lena Conly and her company gave
two concerts here last week. The large,
municipal Hall of Echoes was the place.
The soprano with the plump waist-measure-
ment is as round in her full sweet vocal
organ as she is in her silhouette against the
wall. “Sing Sweet Bird” (Ganz), Lena
Conly’s .first thrill on Saturday night, with
its florid and over-trimmed refrain, was
attacked with exceptional success. The
average concert soprano gets more applause
than she deserves in this showy song, by
reason of a hard-worked flute doing the
genuine canary trill and shake, while the
lady shows a nice set of teeth and worries
along on the trail of the serpent-—I mean
the flautist. The Victorian singer did the
bird-business herself with a mere piano at
her elbow. Determined encores dogged her
evensong. Tenor Charles Bayley has a fine
voice, and only sins sometimes by letting a
throaty flavor trickle through his lower
register.
Handel’s “Harmonious Blacksmith,” with
Walter Barker at the harp, is the best ex-
cuse this town has had for five years or more
for the present-day appearance of that
antique instrument. The cold, thin twang
of the usual harp is a public nuisance when
it rises suddenlv through a soft spot in an
orchestra. Barker, however, seems to have
found the lineal descendant of the Tara’s
Hall specimen, for he drags the soul of
music out of its lean frame and shakes its
attenuated strings into organ-like notes.
He’s a heavenly harpist, but rather too thick
in the middle distance to make a convincing
angel.
Gertrude Summerhayes shows tempera-
ment and technique in her fiddle playing.
She is in the Lena Conly co.
The Kindergarten Union show in the
Town Hall, the other afternoon, was packed
to its last air-hole by adult spectators and
their infant relatives. Gen. sec. Ellen
Desailly and the brisk young principal of the
Roslyn Gardens’ College (Miss Dumolo)
guided the vice-regal steps to the platform.
At this crisis, something sudden happened
at the main entrance, and the crowd that
was outside stopped there in a consolidated
mass that writhed with curiosity, Later, it
dashed forward and nearly fell upon the
infant neck in the vestibule. The Free Kin-
dergarten schools demonstrated with all
their might in the body of the hall. Vete-
rans of six years led the circle games, or
chased nursery rhymes up and down the
scale in small treble voices with a tremble
or tumble or somersault in the puddle bars,
an adult audience being rather disconcerting
to very young talent. Each school had its
outfit of teachers, and the infant handicraft-
ers worked hard at play till the afternoon
crept on to tea-bell.
The Imperial Roller Rink closed like an
oyster on Saturday night. Its winter season
dragged so many of our Best Suburbs back
to the lure of the wheeled skate that the
decorative appearance of its youthful mana-
ger Bendrodt, taking the air on his palatial
marble steps, used to suggest a great peace
and full cash box within.
Dymock’s firm sends along “An American
Girl at the Durbar,” by Shelland Bradley.'
The lady who wrote the yarn is impartially
alluded to as “Mr.” Bradley by one section
of London reviewers, while another section
calls him “Miss.” So I don’t know whether
he is a woman or whether the authoress is
a gentleman. Personally, I don’t think that
anything out of petticoats could get down
into the detail of the “American Girl’s”
clothes area. It’s an ordinary, easy-to-read-
in the train narrative, with a strong thread
of good descriptive writing. It has the usual
story of a camel or something eating the
heroine’s Paris foliage on the crown of her
best hat, in a crowded procession. Nearly
every vain, dressy woman who rushes
through India sends this chestnut along as
her personal experience. Why not change
the locality, and give the processional beast
a taste of a su-Sde shoe?
The A.D.C. of every size and mental color
is heavily embroidered over the pages of “An
American Girl.” In India he differs from
his species as much as he does in Australia,
where we sample them in batches. Usually
I’ve noticed that the local specimen is often
a a j r . imitation of his lord’s best, or worst,
qualities. The jovial sporting type, the
prig, the Man of Means, the Man of Pre-
tensions, the mere fool and the good fellow
make a varied A.D.C. pattern in these
parts. The perpetual shawl- and poodle-
carrying aide seems to be dying out. How-
ever we shall probably meet his ghost in
some shade across the Styx, haunted by the
phantoms of red carpet and “God Save.”
Some women can keep a secret for 24
hours or so. Others can’t keep a hatpin, or
a handy, excuse, or a marcel wave in their
front hair. Madge Mclntosh can lock up a
secret, such as the plot of Randolph Bel-
ford s new play, “The Unseen Eye,” and
hand out all kinds of curiosity-tickling ex-
cuses for not mentioning anything you want
to know. She’s the brainy actress who plays
the heroine’s part in the drama that opens
at the Palace Theatre on Saturday night.
Here’s a sample of the Madge Mclntosh
manner, when she’s hiding a plot under the
crown of a navy-blue hat that perches on the
marcel wave in her front hair. Person
who r wants to know: “What is the Unseen
Eye?”. “Don’t confuse it with the All-seeing
Eye—it’s not a religious play—Australian
drama—down life —yes, Melbourne life.”
Person in charge of interrogation depart-
ment returns to the point. “Going to ride a
horse —got a swag, or billycan, or a bush-
ranger to take the centre of the stage?”
“N —no —not exactly. There’s an office fitted
up with every up-to-date fixture —no steno-
grapher”——“No stenographer in a stage
office, no girl with a 19-inch waist and the
brain of an American Trust no”
“It’s got a dictaphone—do you know what
that is? No? Neither do I!”
Australia has always been called one of
the finest show countries on earth, from the
actor’s point of view. Here the stage idol
is the darling of most smart entertainments
for which his (or her) priceless attractions
can be secured. I am reminded of this by
the recent experiences of some English mum-
mers who recently played “by. command”
before the Vanderbilt millions in the Van-
derbilt villa, at Newport (U.S.). Perhaps
musical comedy ladies have been a little
spoilt by the British peerage, for they ex-
pected to be met on their arrival at the
House of Dollars. They allege that, like the
men in the “Nightbirds” cast, they had to
use the servants’ entrance, and were gene-
rally treated very much as if they had
dropped in at the beginning of the nine-
teenth century to the residence of a Great
Patron. With rage in their hearts, they
were sent, after their performance, to a
separate refreshment tent. Here the orches-
tra. the stage hands and the whole company
were herded together. Before the first satis-
factory bite had passed thew infuriated
countenances, they were bustled off to catch
their train. The American members of the
co. swallowed the offhand treatment as the
usual thing to be expected from their mil-
lionaire class. But the wrath of the Bull
contingent is still overflowing the London
press.

The Superiority of
the “TRIUMPH.”
The neatness of the engine, the substantial design
of the frame, and the general accessibility of every-
thing, are points that draw the appreciation of all
motorists.
This alone would make it the choice of many
riders, but its efficiency, flexibility, hill-climbing
power, high speed with perfect safety, low cost of
operation, long life and smart appearance of
machine and its comfortable riding qualities make
it the motor-cycle that gives the greatest satisfac-
tion.
If you would like personal proof, coine in to our
showrooms and ask our salesmen to explain the
mechanism and the reason of its superiority. Free

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 21, 1912.
My Dear Yarrie,—
The Arts and Crafts Exhibition, last week,
lured State Governor Fuller and his lady to
the heights of the new Town Hall supper
rooms. They opened the show between them
as it were, and enabled the Elect to rush in
with extra enthusiasm, and tread on one an-
other’s corns. The exhibits took up more
room than the visitors cpuld spare, the A. and
C. management having been too modest in
their estimate of public interest at a shilling
a head. President Cresswell, beaming under
widespread blue plumage, led the vice-regal
lady to tea, and saw that she was laden
with roses, before the herd was allowed (at
an extra shilling per hat) to quench its
thirst. Secretary Miss Chomley, who has
spent the past two months fighting pleurisy,
was out of doors for the first time. August
Fischer pervaded the show in a gratified man-
ner; and Carew Symthe, of the Government
Art Department, led Governor Fuller to a
more interesting drinkery beyond the women’s
tea tables. Lady Denman lent some valu-
able stitchery for the show. One. item was
a large sampler, worked by a small child way
back in 1755. Another, a sort of glorified
Indian saddle-bag in gold embroidery. Lady
Carmichael was responsible for an interest-
ing parcel of stuff from foreign parts. Dur-
ing a lull, a society matron was heard to
remark pompously to a buxom daughter:
“Look, Muriel, this is the head-dress of a
Bulgarian pheasant.” A dear old lady of
the extra mild variety peered into a large
case of Filet lace and murmured dreamily:
“I never thought I should admire, it. It is
so new. you see.” Mrs. Miller played at
shop behind a counter of Irish linen and lace.
Mrs. MacDevitt fluffed her feathers proudly
over the local Work Association’s exhibit of
hand-embroidered things, , all of them as
dainty as the fine Parisian convent work.
An exquisite showcase of china, which looked
as if it had been dug out of far Cathay, was
the work of Miss B. B. Davis.
Melbourne florists are blooming wild, so to
speak, on account of the red or waratah ball
to be given here by the Denmans, on Novem-
ber 6. The poisoned thorn lies in the fact
that a Sydney staff is to “compose” the de-
corations.
The George Kelly widow will start the
New Year with a dash Londonward, to see
Dalzell, her youngest boy. He is studying
law at Oxford, English horsehair being, at
present anyhow, more seasoned than the
Australian variety. Still, if the Melbourne
Cup goes on gaining in importance, the stuff
the barrister borrows from the racing animal
will be mostly chased in Australia.
The Byron Moores will shortly have an-
other spare room on their hands, as daughter
Ruby is off to India for the third time.
Daughter Grace, who departed for a trip
with the Brighton Garlands, is still absent.
The rumor that one of the best members
of the distinguished order of spinsters was
going to the altar turns out to have been
wrong. When Toorak put on its best smile
and burst into congratulations, she remarked
briefly that it was the first she had heard of
it. Then everyone backed out as gracefully
as possible, and started to ask where the
rumor had blown from.
_ Mrs. Charles Fairbairn adds two more
girls to the garden of buds at her forthcom-
ing dance. One is an Osborne niece, the
other an English niece, by name Simpson.
Miss Osborne is the elder hope of Major
James of the clan, and the Simpson chick
is the eldest of half a dozen daughters whose
mother was Mrs. Charlie’s youngest sister
Berta. Dad is a naval officer of many but-
tons.
Mrs. J. P. Ryan these days wears a proud
smile. She was the first to secure the Grey-
Egertons for tea and conversation, for which
rite only a select few were summoned.
Cloyne, the Maddens’ old house at St. Kilda,
was the scene of the social event that set
the lately-returned dame beaming with satis-
faction.
Phyllis Power, who left home and husband
to steam westward to greet the Grey-Eger-
ton family party, is just now in strict re-
tirement on her Murray selection, owing to
a vicious insect which bit her face and left
her a “sight.” And when a smart woman is
a “sight” she is not fit to be seen.
Justice Hood’s nice daughter Kate, who
has been travelling through Britain, lately
had to endure the appendicitis operation.
The young Australienne, at latest, was plan-
ning to continue her holiday when she should
feel well enough to go sight-seeing.
Charles Fitzgerald (of the tribe of Lein-
ster), who has taken root at Macedon,
has temporarily put aside his occupation to
chaperone his youngest chick, Nesta, during
the horse frenzy. The Fitzgeralds, though
handicapped with a ducal cousinship, are both
pretty and popular. Mabel, the younger,
was recently collected by squatter Stevenson
and his daughter on their return from a trip
to Colombo, and is now helning to enliven
the domestic atmosphere at Bundook station,
near Hay.
Captain Holdtgren, the particular friend of
Count Morner, of Sydney, is once more
steering through these waters. The gilt-
edged captain announces that the Morner
pair are on their way hither from Norway.
They are coming for the Cup, seemingly, but
their stay will be brief.
The widow Henry Butler turned her
Brighton house upside down, last week, in
order to entertain the orphans from the
Home around the cliffs. The feast was
planned to take place under the wonderful
wistaria in the central court of the mansion.
But the weather, which cares nothing for
widows or orphans, went into liquidation and
chased the youngsters indoors. The food
eventually had to be rent in the ballroom,
and suitable amusements were also provided
under cover. The small visitors were packed
off at last with a bun apiece and a brand-
new shilling. It is highly probable that they
were also blessed before leaving. One of
the disadvantages of being an orphan is that
anyone is entitled to pat you on the head
and load you with a blessing.
Tottie Beeby, the youthful, curly-haired
niece, of the George Beebys, of N.S.W., who
made their summer home ever year at St.
Kilda, has breathed “Yes” to Captain Percy
Roper, from Shoeburyness, Essex. The
black-eyed fiancee has only just elevated her
hair. She was one of the expert water
nymphs of the seaside suburb.
The George Chirnsides are commandeering
the St. Ivilda Town Hall for a Cup week
dance. The only daughter, a delicate wisp
of a girl, who has been “finished” according
to the approved English method, is to make
her local d6but at this revel. She has already
had a London season, so she enters the lists
here as an experienced campaigner.
The daughterless Forrest dame has im-
ported a niece from Westralia to accompany
her during the racing season. Mrs. Forrest
is a keen entertainer of young people, so
Muriel North is assured of a memorable
time.
Mrs. Louise Smith-Dyer and her husband
mark the fact that they are comfortably set-
tled down after their travels by invitations to
a big Race-week At Home, in the Exhibition.
The picture salon is the artistic Corner fenced
off for the tea and chatter, and the invited are
requested to hurry in through the Aquarium
entrance. Louise keeps up the family inter-
est in the Great Barn, whereof her late father
was one of the original trustees. She went
through her bridal feasting and toasting in
a corner of the echoing place.
Mrs. Henry Cornish was responsible for
a big reception at the Grand Hotel last Fri-
day. Spring-street was fairly stuffed with
the motors of the oily classes, and the
lounge and stairs of the tall pub, with their
seas of expensive hats and frocks, looked like
perches in a tropical aviary. Witchcraft
being the favorite pastime of the sex, the wise
hostess had two fortune-tellers imagining
vain things in opposite corners, while a
band twanged and scraped behind palms on
the balcony. One of the Best flappers was
heard to remark in a loud voice: “Both for-
tune tellers have said the same thing; I am
to have three children after marriage.”
Which was a sufficiently moral prediction,
anyhow. The hostess had most of her dim-
ples on view, and wore a semi-transparent
gown of black and white, with the regulation
ostrich on her golden hair. Mother and
daughters Clegg, just returned from the
travel treadmill, looked all the same age; and
supported ospreys above their fashion-plate
outlines. The Forrest dame, in grey, made
plans with the race-winning Wynnes to party
together at the Bohemian Club dance. (Sis-
ter Mrs. Ledingham, by the way, is fore-
swearing this frivolity; but she was present
in black and white at the reception, and
drank tea with neatness and despatch.) Mrs.
Bowes Kelly, an impressive figure in blue,
remarked feelingly that she had cried her-
self nearly blind , over the Mount Lyell
mining tragedy. Mrs. Isaacs chaperoned
father’s dimpled associate daughter, who
shows no signs of legal dryness in her femin-
ine manner. Fan Dango, peering through a
big-patterned white veil, told somebody how
sorry she would be to lose her big step-
daughter; while stepdaughter Elsie Mackav
aforesaid, a beautiful vision in a shell-pink
envelope, beamed good-byes and said she
would soon be back. Mrs. Tom Hogan wore
a Dolly Varden bonnet and some fluffy clothes
which were either red or black or white. I
forget which. While the hours clattered
away, the party kept on renewing itself with
fresh batches of guests, so that the small
hostess at last grew fearful that the weary
fortune-tellers would refuse to prophesy any
more babies, or husbands, or hat money.
But the function came to an end at last, arid
the deafened hall porter went awav to a
nuiet spot and poured water on his buzzing
head.
Mrs. Harold Watson, one of the daughters
of the late Dr. Crosby, of Bananland. has
sister Truda in hand, getting her clothed and
ready for her wedding with squatter George
Campbell, of Darling Downs. Mrs. Watson
and the bride-to-be are at Bairnsdale, motor-
launching on the beautiful lakes thereabout,
and fighting out the last chiffon arguments.
The momentous event is fixed for November
6. at Scots’ Church, in Collins-street.
Mrs. Albert Miller’s musical party, ar-
ranged with the good intention of educating
friends in the nature and habits of music,
suffered a deadlv blow. Marshall Hall, who
was to have done the educating, went down
with an attack of influenza just before the
event, so a scratch programme had to be
arranged by the harassed hostess. She dis-
guised her troubled spirit in black velvet,
and had a green top-dressing on her white
hair. The gathering beamed kindly on the
performers when the music was loud enough
to stop the conversation. The new bride,
Athol Levey Miller, in black, was squir d oy
husband Guy. lame Greswell, Mrs. Kirk-
patrick, Dame Forrest and the niece from
Westralia were amongst the foremost of the
crowd which overflowed the Whernside ball-
room till the announcement of food caused
a polite stampede.
The lean and sadlike Tommy Cochrane, of
Dalgety’s, is billed in the next charity ama-
teur theatricals as the sleuth in “Raffles.”
This looks rather like a sop to the socially
useful young man for being cast as a mere
butler in the last outbreak. Aide Curwen
and Auntie Phipps are also involved. Os-
borne O’Hara, whose acting approaches pro-
fessional standard, and lawyer Hector Mac-
donald are other men implicated in the affair.
The curtain rises on November 1, and they
look confidently for a full house of race-time
visitors and vice-regals. Several Toorak
mansions are sheltering the rehearsals, and
even State Government House echoes loud,
fervent statements, to which the footmen are
deaf as adders, having heard the same weari-
some remarks bellowed 77 times in just the
same way.
The new Oriental Hotel was opened last
week with a mighty popping of corks and a
three-hour banquet, for which the guests were
divided tip into two sections, the men taking
their nourishment in one room and the
women in another. Rupert Clarke smiled
through a speech. It was he who induced
Loosen, the new manager, to venture out to
this corner of the world.
Caulfield’s Wednesday meeting collected
the first bunch of migratory race-goers, just
back from the Sydney galloping. Rupert
Clarke’s dame took the lawn in black, and a
hat shamed with ospreys. By the way, I
hear the Federal Government has made a sud-
den and determined stand about ospreys, and
that the cruelly-worn feathers are absolutely
forbidden entrance. Distraught milliners
are plunging their heads in bandboxes, and
weeping bitterly over the stuffs that are war-
ranted not to shrink; but the prohibition
stands, and their imported treasures arrive
in a severely sub-edited state. The most
harrowing aspect of the case from their point
of view is that this is “an osprey year.” A
mere humanitarian cannot imagine what
grief is compressed into that brief sentence.
On Caulfield Cup Saturday, the lawn and
the back of the stand were merely crowded
thoroughfares leading to the paddock where
the crowd ruined your dress and your tem-
per for you in short order. The half-crown
betting mania drives the exquisitely-gowned
society woman into the crush of the betting
paddock, there to worry any preoccupied man
she knows with her insignificant bit of silver.
The real type of female sport—the sort that
is used to having a racing animal in the
home stables, and knows something of pedi-
gree and form —has a business-like under-
standing with her menfolk about her betting
transactions. This sort of woman is so rare
that a lot of male cynics swear she does not
exist. I know she does, for I have seen one
stuffed. The frenzied half-crowner gets back
to the stand hot and dishevelled, and finds
she has lost her glasses; or else she pro-
duces foolish pearl and gilt miniature opera
toys, and holds them in front of her face
until she realises that her unassisted eye is
better. By then, the race has started at a
remote point of the course, and she has to
drag the sleeve of the nearest man and im-
plore him to tell her what is leading.
At tea time, the various afternoon hos-
tesses were seen signalling in all directions
across the heads of the crowd. The crush
was too severe for social grouping. The
newly-upholstered vice-regal box ‘looked like
a giant bandbox just home from the millin-
ers. Aides in top hats, or top hats with
aides under them, sped round the box till
it seemed to be enclosed by an immense halo.
The Fuller lady, never a keen racing enthu-
siast, said “goo’-bye” early, and a yellow
coupd swallowed her black feathers and shot-
silk racing coat. The refreshmentary was
stormed by the famished during the after-
noon, and one little waitress broke her arm
amid the confusion.
Miss Bluie Atkins —gentlest of damosels—
has committed herself to a song recital in
the Athenaeum Upper Hall this Friday
(25th). Ethel Mercer and Louis Freadman
will help her through the ordeal of a first
concert. Miss Bluie is the eldest daughter
of the Charles Atkins who invented Aus-
tralian Manufactures’ Day, and barracks for
local industry all the year round.
The German community in Melbourne
makes laudable endeavors to sweeten the
sourness of the local Scawtch Sawbath with
a flavoring of sinful “Continental Sunday.”
For instance, the Club Tivoli, which is a
Teutonic institution at Abbotsford by the
Yarra, opens its Englisches Theater any
day of the week to amateur musical and
dramatic caterers, who provide a programme
in German or English, after which the club
room is cleared for a dance. T’other Sun-
day afternoon the pupils of Josephine
Samuell took the stage with “The Sins of
the Father,” adapted from a scene in “Silver
King,” and the fourth act of “Othello,” and
did it very well. On the following Day of
Rest the programme was German drama and
farce, and the next was an Englisches Ivon-
zert with a bit of “She Stoops to Conquer”
wedged among the music. All this is very
saddening for Melbourne’s Noncomformist
Conscience, which has been too busily en-
gaged in shuddering at the irreligiousness of
the French to notice the importation of god-
lessness from Germany.
Blamire Young has fired round cards of
invitation, decorated with his own head, for
his forthcoming picture show. The one and
only Blamire and his works of inimitable art
are to be on view at the Athenaeum Hall for
a fortnight, from October 21. The collec-
tion comprises as subjects, Tasmania in the
early days, design for the Repertory Theatre
production of “The Seagull,” theatrical in-
teriors, and decorative panels.
May Vale contemplates a small studio pic-
ture show during “the off days of Cup week”
-—if there are such blanks in the fiercest
seven days of the whirling year. An inter-
esting bit of work just ready for inspection
is a portrait of Under-Secretary Callaway,
now chief of the Art Department in the
Government General Store. It was hard to
get him to sit still; but the artist has a way
with her. She painted the only portrait that
David Syme ever sat for.
Tenor Walter Kirby is having a concert, in
the Masonic Hall, on October 30. The solid
section of society, which gives expensive At
Homes in well-upholstered nests, is pocketing
tickets at a great rate, and shedding cheque-
book leaves like a forest in autumn. And
truly the mellifluous one has deserved to be
more of a Profit in his own country than has
happened thus far.
The “packer” is not always in evidence in
the theatre gallery. At a recent matinge
a young mother took her babe with her up
to the top seats of Her Majesty’s. After
Blanche Browne’s soprano sobs had been
drowned in the crash of orchestral noise
which brings the first act of “The Quaker
Girl” to a conclusion, she produced from
her bag a small spirit stove, a miniature
saucepan and a bottle of milk. The cow-
juice was heated and the infant duly nour-
ished ; after which, its ma sat back to enjoy
some more of Blanche Browne.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The C. H. Angases came back from England in
order to be present at the death-bed or bursting-up
of the Hill River estate. It has belonged to the
family for decades—which is our equivalent, here-
abouts, for centuries—and the roomy and pictur-
esque old house was Mrs. J. 11. Angas’s home in the
earlier days of her married life. The five-mile
avenue which skirts the: road between Farrell’s Flat
and Clare is on Hill River land—both J. H. Angas
and his father believed in planting as well as clear-
ing, and mathematically precise groves of timber
are to be found in most of the paddocks.
Miss Olive Dutton Green said good-bye to Ade-
laide in a perfect welter of teas. Fina. ;he gave
one of her own at the Queen Adelaide Oiub. Mar-
vellous how the sweet sorrow of parting is mitigated
by food. Her travelling companion is Miss Russell,
a niece of the Downer lady. She has been wintering
here, and is now bound for Cairo and marriage.
Miss Adelaide Baker and her brother are back
from their travels, and Miss Lily Waite and her sister
are on board the incoming Moldavia.
The Kirkby Lunn co. drew herds of country people
to the city, "and the hotels and boarding-houses have
been packed. Mrs. H. H. Dutton was a picturesque
figure at the final concert, and the Hawkers, Gilberts
and Bowmans also temporarily forgot sheep for
music. Members of the co. were feted by the
Lyric Club and at various lunches and minor fes-
tivities. On Sunday some of them found their way
to Hans Heysen’s new home at Amberside, and re-
joiced in his pictures.
By the way, the Kirkby Lunn visit proved yet
again the truth of Artemus Ward’s (or was it Han-
nibal’s?) old adage: “A prophet hath no honor,”
etc. The identity of Brewster Jones was a murky
mystery to most people. “Who is he, anyway?”
queried one damsel.
Mrs. Fearon gave a garden party at Netherby—a
kind of farewell function, as the Fearons are vacat-
ing the remotenesses of Mitcham for North Ade-
laide. They will live at Kouelta—now a private
hospital.
The rowing season opened with a tea at the sheds
on Saturday. Can you tell me, my dear, any social
function that is not either christened or buried to
the accompaniment of tannin, these, days?
“Lady lecturers,” as the dailies call them, are
everywhere. Mrs. Ransom, who has studied theo-
sophy in India and elsewhere, is here to tell us all
she knows, and the revelations are expected to be of
a hair-raising nature. Mrs. Mouchette and Mrs.
Lion, theosophists both, are friends of hers.
Mrs. Harold Fisher gave a small dance at
Dequetteville Terrace, on Friday evening.
Mrs. George Brookman gave a big At Home at
Gilberton on Tuesday. It was a decent day, and
the majority of our old nobility paraded the lovely
garden. Herself wore a smart frock of black and
white. Her daughter, Mrs. T. G. Wilson, wore green
taffetas, and Mrs. Norman Brookman heliotrope
ninon. The Duncan dame was also in black and
white, and Mrs. Chief Justice Way in prime taffetas.
Mrs. Angas Parsons habited herself in a cream gar-
ment, and Miss Jean Warren in a soft frock of grey
muslin.
Our old pal, the burglar, is here once more. He
has just relieved Harris Scarfe and co. of about
£lOOO worth of jewellery. He is a baffling, labori-
ous sort of cuss. He seems to have unlocked the
safe door in the ordinary way, and then to have
laboriously picked the door to pieces by way of a
blind. The police are searching for him with their
customary enthusiasm, and householders are once
more retiring to bed with revolvers under their pil-
lows and doors and windows double-barred.
Harassed parents in search of a trade for their
boys may take note of the fact that for the two years
ending June, 1911, the West Terrace Cemetery,
which is owned by the Government, made a profit of
£3OO and built itself a new fence into the bar-
gain.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.

To Kill Hair.
ELECTROLYSIS AT HOME. APPARATUS
RETURNABLE WHEN DONE WITH.
Superfluous hairs on the face or arms can only be
pot rid of in one way. The roots must he dissolved
by electrolysis.
The well-known Mme. Tensfeldt, one of the most
noted beauty experts in Britain, has for some years
been supplying to ladies, unwilling to pay the dx-
pense of repeated treatment for superfluous hair, a
portable and simple apparatus, for home use. Thanks
to the clear explanation which Mme. Tensfeldt sends
with it, ladies can use it for themselves before a
looking-glass, or a servant or friend can apply it.
The apparatus is charged for one year, and it works
perfectly, without pain or shock, while absolutely
destroying the root of each individual hair. Success
is guaranteed.
Home electrolysis is not like the pastes and fluids
with which ladies have, until now, had to be con-
tent. These substances burn the hair but do not
touch the root; the hair drops out—dead. The root
is completely dissolved, and it is impossible that
hair should ever grow again from the same root.
The Tensfeldt Home Electrolysis outfit will be sent,
carriage paid, to any part of the world for £5 5S;,
international money order or banker’s draft, payable
in the United Kingdom ; and when the apparatus is
done with it can be returned, carriage paid—pro-
vided it is sent within six months—and an allowance
of £1 5s. in cash will be sent immediately in ex-
change for it. The address is Mme. Tensfeldt, 120a,
Princes Street, Edinburgh, Scotland.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
Attorney-General Holman is easily the
hardest worker amongst the TSew South
Wales Ministers in the Assembly. When last
week’s sittings terminated there were 64
Bills on the business paper, and 84 ol these
were in the care of Holman. That perspir-
ing political tortoise, Premier McGowen, had
five as his share, and even then Ins shell
was nearly blazing with excitement.
On present appearances, a time may come,
through much congestion, when the County
of Cumberland will have 89 members in the
N S.W. Assembly, and the rest of the State
•just one. Some years ago there was a redis-
tribution, and the House was reduced by 85
members. The area round Sydney lost eight
and the rest of the State 27. Now there is
to he another redistribution, tv winch Syd-
ney and suburbs will srain five members and
the country will lose five. It might be the
simplest way to disfranchise every place but
Sydney right off and get it over.
One of the improvements proposed in Syd-
ney is the carrying of Moore-street through
to Elizabetli-street. This job, which is only
a few yards long, is expected to cost £50,000
—£450.000 to be paid for the buildings and
£400.000 to be recovered by the sale of re-
constructed properties if the market doesn’t
slump. At this rate, how much will the
reconstruction of Sydney cost? And might
it not be cheaper to create a new State-
owned city which wouldn’t need reconstruc-
tion? Then N.S.W. could have a bit of
street worth £400,000 without having to pay
£450.000 for the demolition of a previous
street.
Put in the fewest possible figures, this is
the staggering record of N.S.W.’s McGowen
Government: —
Year to SO/6/’ll . . . . Deficit £926,643
Year to 30/6/’l2 .. .. „ 524,769
Quarter to 30/9/’12.. .. „ 1,432,135
And this is the wretched gang which secured
offices on its solemn promise to reduce bor-
rowing and practise economy and the other
shining virtues.
The other day Melbourne Arcus gave a
conspicuous position to “Mother,” who
wrote in a condition of tight-lipped asperity,
rebuking those parents who purposed show-
ing their abomination of the maternity
allowances by refusing to touch the tainted
fiver. It may, considered “Mother,” be de-
grading to handle the coin, but the end jus-
tifies the means. Affluent mammas are
advised that they need not use the evil
jthing, and need not have it about the house
more than a few minutes before dispatching
it “to such political associations as are
striving to free the country from reckless
caucus Government.” It sounds like ingrati-
tude. Fisher, gasping his last political
breath, is to find the arrow that slew him
barbed with his own bonus.
Last week, down by the watery N.S.W.-
Yictorian border, a number of military
officers finished a “staff ride” —the modern
warrior’s educative substitute for real cam-
paigning. For a number of days, they were
galloping and trotting about the country,
armed with handfuls of maps, and imagin-
ing two opposing armies of State Frivhts
engaged in civil war over some such argu-
ment as the eviction of Governor-General
Denman. It is good to feel that such a dis-
astrous row is practically beyond the wildest
dreams of Australia, but no particular
thanks is due to the State Parliaments or the
daily press. If either of these institutions
were regarded seriously by the public, there
would be some chance of the wretched little
border squabbles raising serious trouble. But
the vicious old spirit that regarded the Mur-
ray as a sort of Australian Rhine, and the
Australians on the other side as foreigners,
does not exist any more in real life. And
however the Geebung may drivel, he. never
sees himself lying flat on his waistcoat
alongside a rifle where the big, placid river
flows down to the sea. Down in the base-
ment of his deceitful heart he feels that his
alleged grievances are not worth it.
A SUGGESTION.
YOUNG AUSTRALIA (mounted on new mono-
rail): "It may not bring in many more
votes, old slow coach, but it will bring a
uniform gauge, is up-to-date, and has many
other recommendations. So get a hustle on
and consider it."
Party Government is a quaint animal —
even the sloth which walks upside down is
ordinary by comparison. Hedges, of Wes-
tralia, has been trying hard to convince the
Federal Government that jarrah will make
better and more ant-resisting sleepers for the
transcontinental railway than karri, and that
such sleepers are also cheaper. Getting no
farther forward, he at last brought up the
matter in the House of Heps., and was de-
feated by a strict party vote. Every Govern-
ment man voted that karri would stand ants
better than jarrah, and every Opposition
man voted the other way. Even purely
city members who wouldn’t know a white
ant or a jarrah tree if they found them in
their soup went solid on the good old lines.
Consequently, barrister Bruce Smith',' who
was absent, and didn’t hear the evidence,
paired one way and barrister Hughes, who
was also absent, paired the other.
OUR UNCLE JEAN CRAPAUD-COHEN.

financiers. —News item.
MCGOWEN : “ This is your new uncle—Uncle
Crap and. Mind you're nice and polile to

Bull-Cohen!"
Dr. Chappie, late of Wellington (M.L.),
and now member of the British Parliament
for Sterlingsliire, seems to be hunting fame
of the cheaper sort with a lot of energy.
He has cut in with a proposal to solve the
Irish question by inserting a clause in the
Home Rule Bill giving the option to the
province of Ulster to attach itself to Scot :
land or England, provided
that it has a majority of
voters in favor of such
attachment, and th at
either Scotland or Eng-
land has a similar ma-
jority in favor of taking
it over. The suggestion
is about as weirdly un-
practical as it well could
be, but it doubtless serves
its purpose in keeping
Chappie in the limelight.
It amounts to about the
same thing as a clause in
the Commonwealth con-
stitution which should
enable Westralia to be-
come part of Tndia or
S’Africa, and Tasmania
to hook on at will to
Maoriland or Fiji. Any-
how, Chappie’s idea would
be futile, for no majority
in the whole of Ulster
would ever vote itself out
of the fun which may be
at any time transpiring in
Irish politics. Joseph
Chamberlain, in 18 85,
or thereabouts, made a
tentative suggestion of a
separate Parliament for
Ulster, but said no more
about the matter when it
was pointed out that even
Ulster had a majority of
votes for Home Rule.
“It is not till lie misses something from
the breakfast table that the average Eng-
lishman begins to hunt for his gun. Patriot-
ism in those isles is a full stomach ana an
ear for martial music.” —Slab of cynicism
from Andrew Soutar’s new novel, “broken
Ladders
THE LESSON.
At its last meeting, the local branch of the Politi-
cal Labor League decided to forward the following
resolution to the next Labor conference: “That all
public schools should teach the children the curse of
land monopoly.”
PEDAGOGUE: “ And this is the great Austra-
lian dog-in-the-manger —only more so! ”
Apropos Governors and their household
gods. N. S. Wales (and all the States for
the matter of that) deal very squarely
with Governors now-
adays. It was n't
always thus. When
G.-G. Denman stood
bowing hi s adieux
from the Melbourne
express one evening
last week he took
with him only what
he stood up in. He
had nothing else to
take. The Govern-
ment furnishes the
house and home for
the Governor, sup-
plies him with ser-
vants, and pays even
for his shoe polish.
Governors in olden
days had to furnish
for themselves. Sim-
eon Lord, old time
auctioneer, was
called in to auction
Governor Macquarie’s
effects, and coming
down io our own
time we find that «T.
T. Staff advertised
that he would sell for
Sir Charles Fitzroy,
on January 11, 1855,
“furniture, particularly neat, substantial
and well selected, consisting chiefly of 18
bedsteads, 8 arm and easy chairs, 24 tables.
12 washstands, wines, brandies, ale and
stout.” To-day if Government House needs
an extra window blind a requisition is
made out and forwarded to an expensive
contractor. Yet neither Macquarie nor Fitz-
roy got anything like the salaries paid to
Excellencies to-day.
The inevitable has arrived, and Treasurer
Cann has warned all the spending depart-
ments of N.S.W. to go slow, because there is
only a thin stratum of borrowed cash left
on the anguished floor of the Treasury.
There isn’t enough available money on earth
to keep up the pace which the maddened
Ministry was going. So some works will
have to be abandoned, and some to be hung
up half-finished, and some will have to ease
off. It is impossible to dig out £5,000,000
a year of loan funds as a steady thing, and to
give everybody a permanent job at railway-
building. Belshazzar, in fact, has seen the
writing on the wall, and the legend is
“N.S.F.” Still Cann is trying to break the
news gently. He says he doesn’t propose to
sack men. They are simply to go slow. But
it is impossible to pay men out of an empty
Treasury for loafing, and the wholesale sack
isn’t far off.
Frederick Flowers, vice-president of the
N. S. Wales Legislative Council, was so sore
over the dissection the Gas Bill suffered
there last week that he publicly assailed
one of the Government’s new nominees to
the Council who had kicked over the party
traces. This was J. A. Browne, who had
moved an amendment which Flowers de-
scribed as diametrically opnosed to the prin-
ciples of the Bill. Said Flowers: —
I only wish to warn hon. gentlemen that they are
responsible for the Bill. .. .They are doing it with
their eyes open, but it comes pretty hard to find that
the knife is plunged into the Bill by one of my own
supporters.
Jago Smith: It shows how bad the Bill must be.
Flowers: No; it shows how unsophisticated the
hon. and learned member is, how amenable he has
become, and how his environment is influencing his
political opinions.
Ashton: Did you consult with the hon. member on
the question of premium, capital and reserves when
you say that he has altered his opinion?
Flowers: I am not in the habit of consulting with
a gentleman who has had such little experience of
political life. However, I suppose we must take it
with the very best grace; but at the same time 1
think it might have been left, in decency, to those
who are quite as much concerned as the hon. and
learned member himself.
Browne looked as if a swarm of bees or
bears had suddenly settled on his conscience.
He hadn’t realised before that he was ex-
pected to pay for his appointment by that
kind of unquestioning support.
THE DESERT AND ITS FRIENDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 saw a dreadful shape arise,
Swirled in a dust-cloud rolling brown,
Presage of death was in its eyes,
And famine whitened on its crown ;
Its laughter filled the world with fear,
Its tread was as the march of doom,
A horror framed to scorch and sear
And harry nations to the tomb.
The cornlands withered at its breath,
Deserted homesteads showed its path,
It smote the village with slow death,
To pine in death’s dull aftermath ;
Vineyard and orchard shrank away,
And at the terror of its eyes
The axe and hammer ceased to play
The lilting song of enterprise.
The voices of the children died,
The schools were closed, the playgrounds still,
And o’er a fading landscape wide
Drear ruin gazed from plain and hill.
The red sun rose, the red sun fell,
Counting the days in light and flame,
With never voice or sound to tell
The parsing hamlet’s perished name.
And swirled in dust-clouds rolling brown
I saw the dreadful shape advance,
While famine whitened in its crown
And horror darkened in its glance.
Then first I heard it speak aloud.
In accents like the voice of sin
It cried: “I war upon the proud,
I am the desert, and I win !
“Old Babylon fell at my feet,
Memphis and Thebes my hot sand slew;
Dead Nineveh has felt the heat
Of barren summers, smitten through
With fierce winds blowing from my heart,
Palmyra slumbers on my breast —
In lonely silences apart
I gather lands to quiet rest.
“And young Australia, who so late
Arose to stop my headlong way,
Is heir to all the hungry hate
That gathers in my wastes of grey.
Oh, once before her infant might
I thought to hide my vanquished head
Where now I laugh in shrill delight
To know her light hopes lightly sped!
“For I have allies stout and true
To aid my strength and work my will,
Who draw the country’s life-blood through
Their narrow ways that throng and fill.
They choke the wide land’s stronger breath
To swell their city by the sea,
And lead a people’s hopes to death
And leave the richer fields to me.
“I creep and creep from year to year,
Their frontier narrows at my tread,
My swirling dust-clouds give me cheer,
I inarch through places of the dead.
My laughter echoes loud and strong
As grim with hope I see the end,
For still the desert has a song
To greet McGowen as a friend!”

The long arm of coincidence reached out
last week and achieved a regular “Two Cups” scoop.
On the second day of the Caulfield meeting (Wednes-
day), veteran Herbert Power's Wilari went hung
while running in the Eclipse Stakes, and had to be
withdrawn from the Caulfield Cup, for which she
had been solidly backed by stable and public. She
is not likely to race again. On the very next day
the Mitchells decided that, after all, it was better
not to risk a patching-up of Trafalgar for the Mel-
bourne Cup, etc. They had intended retiring the
champion, in any case, after Flemington and Rand-
wick Autumn meetings ; but further racing with that
tendon of the near fore-leg would have meant chanc-
ing a fall, knocking about and general breakdown.
So Trafalgar was scratched for the Melbourne Cup,
and retired from the turf at 5.50 p.m. on Thursday
evening, October 17. Both Wilari and Trafalgar are
by Wallace, and in the opinion of all decent and
right-thinking people the long arm aforementioned
was too darned busy altogether when it swept a
grand-daughter and a grandson of Carbine out of
the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups, and off the turf at
one fell swoop.
“The Mug” snorts magnificently: My
Caulfield Cup pick, Wilari, for whom Victoria’s star
jockey, G. Lambert, had been engaged, fractured
something early in the Eclipse Stakes, and was
promptly scratched for the Mile and a Half Cup. I
don’t blame the mare for doing it; but I do object
to the time chosen, as it prevented me informing the
brethren that her mana would pass with her jockey
to the back of Uncle Sam. But even this catastrophe
had its humorous side, and that was the way the
horse scribe rose to the occasion. “Broke a blood
vessel” was no use to his magniloquence. One Syd-
; ney man described how the Wallace mare came in
with “blood dripping from her nostrils,” while the
Australasian went the whole hog and described her
as “covered with blood.” She went out a bay and
came in a rich ruby, so to speak ; after which the
Melbourne weekly proceeded to tip the flat-catching
sprinter, Royal Scotch, of Maoriland, to win the
Caulfield Cup; and most other press “guides”
tumbled into the same trap. The sages intermit-
tently trot out the truism that “weight for age form
is no guide to handicaps,” but let a w.f.a. event be
won by a candidate for a big handicap to be run two
or three days later, and they shriek that w.f.a.
winner as a cert. Royal Scotch is the third Maori-
lander to trip up the press boobs in recent years at
Caulfield, by winning the nine-furlong w.f.a. Stakes
and failing in the Caulfield Cup. Pink ’Un (1908)
and Artillerie (1909) were the others. It, was
McLachlan’s brilliant horsemanship that lifted Royal
Scotch into third place to collar £250. The hoof-
crack of a few days previous was apparently all
right, or the moke would not have started. “Keep
off Stakes winners for Cups” is a golden rule that
applies always and everywhere. In all the years of
the Melb. Stakes (l:j miles, w.f.a., run three days
before the Cup), the winner has only twice suc-
ceeded in landing the Melbourne Mug, and the last
occasion was a couple of generations back. Second,
third, unplaced nags and also non-starters in the
Stakes have won the Melbourne Cup, but a Stakes’
victory is a well-established Cup curse. In 1895
Hova won the Stakes and started a hot favorite tor
the Cup, but ran second to Auraria. In ’96 and ’97
none of the first three in the Stakes were placed in
the Cup. In ’9B Battalion won the Stakes from The
Grafter, and the latter won the Cup. In ’99 and
1900 the Stakes shed nothing but gloom on Cup
happenings. In ’Ol Wakeful won the Stakes from
San Fran, and Revenue the Cup from the same nag.
In ’O2 Wakeful won the Stakes from Victory, and
Victory won the Cup. Wakeful won the Stakes for
the third time in ’O3, with Lord Cardigan second,
but his lordship reversed the positions in the Cup.
Since then such Stakes winners as Tartan, Poseidon,
Peru, Alawa and Trafalgar (thrice previously placed
in the Stakes) have failed in the big event. ' Last
year it was the Stakes third, Parisian, that grabbed
the big prize on the Tuesday. Yet every time the
Stakes winner has been in the Cup, he or she has
been boomed for the two miles, and often very fran-
tically. So it will probably be this time, though if
Duke Foote does not run in the Stakes, the booming
of that alleged Cup cert, will continue irrespective
of Stakes results.

Next Saturday’s Moonee Valley Cup (11
miles) is worthy of attention. The distance has been
altered as often as that of the A.J.C. Summer Cup,
but at time of writing it was to be lj miles this
year. Thirty-three mokes, including sundry Cup
candidates, were allotted various burdens. Ladv
Medallist heads the list with 9st. 91b., and six others
have above Bst. The average winning weight for the
event at H miles is about 7st. 101 b.. and there are
th ree likely ones on that mark in Flaith, Sandbath
and Mousme. Above them, the best are Ladv Medal-
list and Flaith’s stable mate, Gillamatong, with 7st
131 b., Below them. Karnattan. 7st. 71b ; Indiscreet
6st. 111 b. r and Moe, 6st. 71b. But the three on
7st. 101 b should include the winner. Only twice has
a M.V. Cup winner collared the Melbourne Cup 10
days later. Clean Sweep did it in 1900. and Blue
Spec five years later. Last year Hartfell won—his
last success for Agar Wynne before being sold to
Merton. In 1910 Ilartfell won the Phoenix Handi-
cap, of one mile. MV. Cup day, and next Satur-
day that event may go to the Vanquisher, owned bv
Merton.
“F.”: By what earthly process of reason-
ing does “Tne Mug” advise punters to back horses
that are weighted at the average winning weight
for the Cups, seeing that the actual thing is rarely
carried by the winner? Taking the figures for 30
years, I find that the average weight for the winners
of both Cups has been a fraction under 7st. 111 b. for
the Caulfield, and Bst. (within an ounce or so) for
the Melbourne Cup. And what else do I find ?
That only one horse (Blue Spec) has carried the
average Melbourne Cup winning weight in those 30
years, and only one winner (Maranui) has humped 7st.
lllb. at Caulfield. So the betting is 29 to one by
the law of averages against the average being
exactlv maintained this year. How is the average
arrived at? In the Caulfield Cup six winners have
carried 6st. odd (ranging from 6st. 91b. to Ost.
131 b.), 14 carried 7st. odd pounds, nine had Bst.
odd on their backs, and two got home with 9st.
and more. The fact of a dead heat in one year
makes the number of winners 31 in 30 years. For
the Melbourne Cup the figures are two winners in
the 6st. division, 15 in the 7st., eight in the Bst.,
three in the 9st., and one (Carbine) in the lOst.
An important factor in the Melbourne Cup average
is the number of three-year-olds (seven of ’em)
which have won with 7st. odd for their handicap, in
accordance with the unwritten law that preserves a
voung horse from Bst., and the written law that
imposes not less than 7st. 61b. on a Derby winner.
How absurd is “The Mug’s” suggestion, of special
importance for the average winning weight, which
does the trick once in 30 years! Within the past
13 years three winners—Merriwee, Acrasia and
Poseidon —have carried 7st. 61b., two of them being
penalised up to that limit for their Derby wins.
The average winning weight for the past 17 Melbourne
Cups has been only 7st. 101 b., as against Bst. for
30 years. And why this big drop in the average?
Because eight three-year-olds have won Melbourne
Cups in those 17 years, whereas only five youngsters
have captured Caulfield Cups in all the years of its
life. This, and the fact that the heaviest-weighted
“cracks” rarely run at Caulfield, but sometimes win
at Flemington, explains why the Melbourne. Cup
winners’ average is 31b. higher than the other.

The end of Johnson, champion pug of the
world, is indeed inglorious. It is his doom to fall,
not to the fists of an opponent worthy of his glove,
but to the tongue and talons of a hard-faced Yankee
she-personage, who hadn’t sufficient racial pride to
prevent her daughter being a nigger’s stenographer;
but had brains enough to know when to come in and
raise smoke. Johnson, apparently, fell a victim to
his own meanness. He likes his fun, but objects to
paying through the fist, let alone the nose for it; and
he didn’t realise that this outraged mother was loaded
head and tail. His white wife had just committed
suicide, and the mother of the White girl, who seemed
to have taken the place of the dead white wife, con-
sidered the time was ripe. Johnson was unpopular
before, but after the suicide of his wife he was de-
tested ; and when the population heard he had ab-
ducted a white girl from the care of her parent—-
well, then the population just reached for its gun,
and Johnson had to take to his heels. The white
population may do that sort of thing iteslf, but it
won’t stand a big nigger doing it with white women.
Johnson had been nibbling daintily at the gilded lure
of Mclntosh to come to Australia on the chance of
meeting his Waterloo, and when this riot occurred
he was wildly anxious to come right away as soon as
he could get out of trouble. But Mclntosh, who said
some fairly nasty things about him over his wife’s
suicide, was full. Johnson stuck in his throat. Act-
ing with his usual promptitude, regardless of finan-
cial considerations, he cabled to cancel all arrange-
ments. Johnson is turned down. His name is Mud.
Australia is closed to him. England is barred against
him. The United States will not have him. His one
haven is Paris ; and even Paris is getting respectable.
Anyhow, as a matter of strict business, Mclntosh did
well to cancel Johnson. Johnson only brings the
boxing sport into disrepute wherever he goes; and,
anyhow, it is quite possible before he gets through
with this Yankee lady and her daughter he may be a
few years older. A nigger charged with abducting
a white girl in the U.S.A. generally strikes some-
thing very solid.

Aecoi’ding to the mailed accounts, the
downfall of Australian boxer Dave Smith, in New
York, was beastly in its suddenness. But, all the
same, the Kangaroo can solace himself with the fact
that it was not a fist wallop that outed the Aus-
tralian. Smith was not showing to advantage, and
had been tapped, and the Yankee, rushing in to ad-
minister the knock-out, missed with his fist, but
caught Smith on the point with the top of his head.
Smith was in dreamland but still on his feet, and, of
course, caught the blizzard, and went down. Being
obviously unable to continue he was outed, although
he did stagger to his feet. It’s a curious thine', but
nearly every new arrival in the United States falls
victim to that sort of accident, or some other of the
same tribe. It may be only coincidence —but it is
remarkable that all the accidents go against the
foreigner. They may be great people, the Yankees,
but they’re precious poor sportsmen.

A carking suspicion, verging on complete
certainty, arises in the breast of this publication that
the Frenchman has not got what may be termed the
stoush temperament. In ! the same ring where the
loathly Johnson administered to Tommy Burns a
most unholy hiding Hock Keys, last Saturday night,
placed- the acid on Leon Bernstein, some time of
Paris. Burns, when the police stopped the massacre
and called Johnson off, was fullv prepared (in fact,
eager) to go on indefinitely. Yet his jaw had been
smitten an inch or more out of plumb, one of his
eyes was closed and the other closing, bumps the
size of bantams’ eggs decorated his brow, his body
was a mass of contusions, and one of his ankles had
gone. Bernstein was not marked by Keys ; in fact,
Keys hardly hits with sufficient force to mark anyone
of reasonable toughness in the matter of hide. A
smart fusillade of punchlets in the neighborhood of
the midriff were the deadliest goods that the Austra-
lian champion handed out to his Gallic brother. Any
local boy would have stood them for years. Not so
Leon. They filled him with dismay and hopelessness,
and utter desolating grief. In the eighth round he
retreated from them at a brisk hand-gallop, and ele-
vating both gloves in token of surrender, broke for
his. corner, and there bowed his head and wept. It is
the second time that the writer has seen France dis-
solved in tears in the ring during the past month,
and the spectacle grows wearisome. How in the
name of mendacity one daily paper was able to term
this futile scrap “the best of the season,” and what
induced another to call it “a clever and interesting
contest,” are, to the mere blunt and unimaginative
retailer of unfrilled truths, so many insoluble mys-
teries. Bernstein is a clever and attractive boxer,
and he seems to have a punch. But he is not within
coo-ee, or for that matter within cabling distance, of
the class of Keys. And the rugged nerve, which en-
ables a fighter to take hard punches over a long
term, and still come up dourly for more, is wholly
absent from his make-up. He is a nice-looking boy,
a speedy runner, and a ready tear-shedder, but as
a pug he is a false alarm comparable to a Marathon
entrant who is incapable of racing more than half a
mile.
The swimmers of Sydney got fairly going
on Saturday, when the perfect afternoon saw no less
than eight amateur clubs, three league (semi-pro-
fessional), and two ladies’ clubs in the water. It
was the second Saturday of the season, but the pad-
dlers have not yet got into their stride, although
Rose Bay (Sydney) saw Teddy Wickham do a
graceful sprint over 50yds. in a style that was dis-
tinctly prpmising. Another of the Longworth family
showed conclusively that speed and stamina are in
the blood. #
Parramatta (Sydney), which was some-
what downhearted over the defeat of the Heckenberg
family team in the tug-of-war recently, bucked up
somewhat on Saturday evening last when it learned
that Leslie W. Pye had again won the hill-climbing
contest with that invincible Vauxhall motor of his.
The test took place at Artillery Hill, National Park,
which is a beastly proposition for anything but the
toughest breed of motor-cars. About 50 were pre-
sent, and they all received a territtic knocking about
from the awful roads they had to pass over to get
to the deciding spot. Sydney roads have become a
scandal and a crime. Fourteen cars competed in
Class A, and Mr. Pye won easily, the next best man
being Mr. Carter with a Crossley, nine points be-
hind. The Parramatta champion is a conjurer with
a car —he talks to the blessed thing, and it does
whatever he asks or nearly bursts in the effort. Had
he not started life as a pharmacist he would have
made an excellent engineer; and had he toiled on
the footplate of a railway engine he would have
been one of that mysterious, world-wide clan known
as “Hell-fire Jack.”
The “Test Races” at Sydney last week
tossed up S. Burtenshaw as representative of the Ma
State at the Australian cycling championships meet-
ing at Brisbane. Both the half and the five miles
events fell to the twirling of his feet; and he goes
forth branded front and rear as the choicest amateur
goods to be found round Sydney .
The second round of Sydney First Grade
cricket came to its end on the most perfect after-
noon since the season began. The result is to
separate Glebe, North Sydney and Redfern from the
rest. They are together in the front rank of the
competition with four points each. It was a day
of stupendous cricket, both batsmen and bowlers
doing wonderful deeds. Taylor, of Burwood, took
in 127, and then carried his bat in triumph. Victor
Trumper, of Gordon, biffed 118 before Finneran
bowled him. Freeman, of Glebe, slogged 110, and
then fell to Stafford, off Cody. Norman, of the
same club, put up 108, and kept possession of the
timber. Barnes, of Redfern, also carried his bat,
and left the neat century to his credit when all his
lovely companions had faded and gone. Below these
were five others, who put up big scores; but the list
grows monotonous. Among the bowlers, P. Newton,
of Waverley, got six Middle Harbor wickets for 39
runs. Long, of North Sydney, swept away five
Petersham sticks for 12 runs. - Dupain, of Burwood,
got five Redfern batsmen for 61 runs. The great
and hideous example of the round was the downfall
of Petersham before the onslaught of North Sydney,
which had declared with 473 for the loss of eight
wickets. Against this appalling heap of runs the
flabbergasted Petersham team could put up only 61,
four of its men vanishing under the sign which is
the end of a water-pipe, and good old Sundries mak-
ing only four. Following on, the team did better,
and built up 204 for Seven wickets; but, of course,
that didn’t count. The defeat was by 412 runs on
the first innings. If anybody knows anything worse
than this to overtake a team at the beginning of a
season, let him declare it not; but bury it as a
thihg that should be forgotten. Balmain got Uni-
versity where it lived, with 245 against 216, and
scored a first innings’ win by 29. Gordon just scram-
bled out with 15 to the good on the first innings by
digging out 230 to Sydney’s 215. Waverley, which
declared with 241 for the loss of nine wickets, did
not allow itself any too wide a margin, as Middle
Harbor rushed together 198, and so finished only 43
behind on the first trial. Paddington,, which left
247 on the board for Glebe to wipe out, saw Glebe
do it, by putting up 320 for the loss of eight
wickets, and so lost by a pair of wickets and 73
runs on the innings. Burwood left 151 for Redfern
to eclipse, and the Syrian suburb dredged together
204 for the loss of nine wickets, hurriedly closed,
and requested Burwood to go in and get killed for a
two-point victory. Burwood defied it with 210 for
the loss of four wickets, so Redfern had to be con-
tent with its first innings victory by 53. The down-
fall of the Premier team, University, to the Bal-
maniacs was a distinct surprise. The surprising
part is that there was no sudden, unexpected, phe-
nomenal score on the part of Balmain to account
for it. Its highest record was the 77 of J. Myers,
but that and the 65 of Kemmis caused University
to kick the beam. Petersham went utterly to pieces
before the onslaught of bowlers Long and Hordern.
Long’s five wickets for 12 was bad enough m all
conscience, but to strike a second bowler like Hord-
ern with four for 29, was the luck of a bedridden
devil at the back of perdition. #
The way professional pedestrianism flour-
ishes and grows is marvellous, and it is due largely
to the efforts of the N.S.W. Athletic League. The
League keeps things on a very solid basis. In 1904
there were 14 clubs and 359 peds. registered. This
year (1912) has 135 clubs and 1496 members. Ex-
actly what the League gets out of it is hard to im-
agine—but, all the same, the League has done good
work, and had it got on to its job early enough on
its present lines, athletics might have never slumped
in popular favor as they did. #
Though the weather conditions were per-
feet, the wickets true and the outfields fast and
clean few of Melbourne’s first-grade batsmen made
much of a show on Saturday. Carlton encountered
East and gave a most lamentable exhibition, eight
wickets falling for 26 ; then the tail propped itself
up mildly, and raised the total to 65. McNaughton
took four wickets for 20 and Hendrie four for 37.
East had little difficulty in beating that paltry
score, and was 131 for four wickets when time was
called. ‘Roy met Essendon, and its two best bowlers,
being* in good nick, took the ’Dons by (the slack of
the flannels, in a manner of speaking, and ran the
whole side out for a wretched little 52 —Boulter five
for 30, Camion four for 22. The Maroons matched
that'score with the loss of one wicket, and thereafter
proceeded to make defeat impossible by piling up runs
regardless of ’Don’s lacerated feelings. ’Mood met
the premiers, ’Cote, and erected a distinctly moderate
total: of 170. ’Cote has, apparently, a good chance
of winning next Saturday if its batsmen are fit and
don't get the dumps or the megrims, and ’Wood s
bowlers aren’t too strong and the fine weather holds,
etc., etc. South bumped against North, and filled m
the afternoon with a sort of graceful negligence by
amassing 187 for seven wickets. ’Varsity pushed
together a young mountain of 253 runs for three,
while Richmond’s fieldsmen sprinted after the ball,
which seemed to have an unaccountable habit of
going where it wasn’t expected. It must be very
annoying to a thoughtful skipper to place his men
carefullv and deliberately in every position but the
right one, and then when he blocks that opening, to
observe a new leak develop somewhere else.
Melbourne indulged in its usual practice match
—with P’ran this time—and its men were all out
for 213 —Ransford 69, R. G. Johnstone 64 (not out).
P’rah had scored seven for no wickets when stumps
were drawn. So far nobody has knocked loudly at
the ,doo£ Of the selection committee, which picks an
inter-Stat.e team on November 1, though Willis, of
’Varsity, threatens to push through the aperture.
It was like a whiff from the splendid days
of yore to hear that E. G. Bonnor, nephew of one-
time mighty smiter George of that ilk, had made
local history at Glen lnnes (N.S.W.) by a double-
barrelled deed of derring-do. After knocking to- .
gether 99 runs he did a lot towards demolishing the
other side by gathering eight wickets for six runs.
Last season his visit to Sydney with the country
team met with but little success. The visit with the
bush brethren this season may leave a different mark
in history.
They’re beginning to kick hard in the
press in the United States against the sums earned
by the top-notch boxers, and shocked writers are say-
ing it is absolutely wrong that a boxer should receive
more for a couple of months of training and an hour
or so of slogging than a University professor does in
a year. It certainly is a reflection on the taste of
the community at large; but that does not seem to
be a legitimate reason for ukasing that no boxer
shall receive above a certain amount. That would
merely mean that the lion’s share would go to other
people, for as long as boxing exhibitions are popular
people will pay their money to see them; and if
the pub ic puts up vast sums for boxing, it seems
only right that the men who box should get a fair
share of it. Exactly what fate is in store for a
community that pays its bruisers and Chapzanders
more than it does its scientists is hard to say—it
certainly ought to be something fairly awful.

In a recent issue The Bulletin was
induced to remark that Australian cricketer lla/.litt
was 30 years of age, whereas he is merely 21. The
odd six years are herewith withdrawn and handed to
the Religious Editor’s tame barmaiden. This will
bring her to the age of discretion, or as near as
woman is ever likely to get to that desirable period.
The football season for Australia ended
with an odd sort of inter-State match in Adelaide.
The premier clubs of S.A. and Victoria usually meet
as a supplementary fixture, but Essendon and West
Adelaide could not arrange it. So the seconds, Carl-
ton and Port Adelaide, hastily fixed up a meeting in-
stead. By a coincidence each claimed to have been
the best local club on the whole winter's play,
though knocked out in the “finals” by a side trained
to the minute. The Adelaide public, however, stayed
away enthusiastically and in great numbers. They
missed seeing a quaint incident. Under Australian
rules, a boundary umpire has to throw in the ball
blindly. It was thrown in right on top of the um-
pire. The “ruck” swarmed all over him. He got
an elbow on the chin and another over the heart, and
was passed out. One of the boundary umpires took
his place. “Port” won easily, in the presence of
under 3000 people. Exit the muddied oaf for 1912.
Victorian motorists are moving to get a
racing track equal to that at Brooklands, with ac-
cessories, and about 100 of them lately inspected
Fern Tree Gully, to see how the land lay. An allot-
ment there would make an ideal track, right along-
side the station, with high hills abutting where the
finish would be, but the price is from £25 to £3O
per acre. The gully is little more than half an
hour’s ride from town—22 miles as the motor flies
—and there is no other patch within the distance
and the figure that offers such facilities for a track
with similar spectacular opportunities. In motor-
racing five-sixths of the attraction is in watching
the heavy cars whizzing round with Death running
behind and the undertaker following. People say
that the hills adjacent to the proposed course would
be a grand place to watch an accident from.
The British Association for the Advance-
ment of Science has been holding its annual
meeting at Dundee (Scotland). It is coming
to Australia some day, to die of old age and
be buried where its dead body can get a
gleam of sunshine. Charles Dickens chris-
tened it the “Mudfog Association.” It is
said to be related to the Seven Sleepers of
Ephesus and the Smithsonian Institute of
Boston. Dickens had a dreary time reporting
its proceedings in London Morning Chron-
icle. All sorts of scientific cranks and bores
get on their props and gas away for hours
at a stretch at the annual sessions
of the British Ass. This time a tremen-
dous old Presbyterian dominie —one Sir
Charles Donaldson, Principal of St. An-
drews’ University—droned for three mortal
hours on the advantages of phonetic spell-
ing. There are lots of points about phonetic
spelling, but one of his arguments
was that the article would enable us to
“get hold of the Chinese nation.” Get hold
of the Chinese! All sensible people want
to get away from them. His final conclusion
was that spelling should not be taught at
all. “Everybody should be allowed to spell
as he likes.” The only lucid interval in the
three-hours’ speech.
DOES YOUR CHILD SUFFER FROM
WORMS?
Stomach and Intestinal Worms are the
cause of nine-tenths of the crying, fretful-
ness and irritability of children. The mere
mention of worms makes one feel uncomfort-
able, and their presence in the system must
assuredly cause such torture and agony that
there is little wonder at the irritable dispo-
sition which is so often developed, not only
in children, but frequently in adults. Worms
require a specific medicine, and there is no
better remedy than Comstock’s “Dead Shot”
Worm Pellets, as used by Mrs. Willmott, of
Cooma, N.S.W,, who states: —“Hearing
about the wonderful success of your Worm
Pellets, I decided to give them a trial. I
gave my three children —Roy, Phyllis and
Horace —a dose each, as they had all the
symptoms of Worms. The Pellets were
taken at 6 o’clock in the morning, and at
10 o’clock Roy had passed a Stomach Worm
about 12 inches in length, and the other
children passed quite a number of Thread
Worms. Since taking the Pellets the chil-
dren seem greatly relieved,, and appear to be
better in health. I shall always recommend
them to my friends,_ and you may use this
testimonial for publication in any way you
please.”
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable preparation for the
eradication of Worms in children and adults.

DUNLOP RUBBER CO., All States and New Zealand
A Sydney, tram conductor’s life is far
from being an ideal state of existence. If
lie runs his car to time, he kills people and
breaks dowagers; and if he saves the lives
of people and lands his dowagers intact, he
gets into hot water for being late. Some
one invented an ancient saw, “Silly as a
sheep”; • but the rattiest sheep that ever
breathed is a monument of intelligence com-
pared to the average female tram passenger.
She will get in and out on the wrong side,
even if she has to walk right round the block
to do it. She carefully lowers herself to the
pavement with her face towards the rear of
the vehicle, so that she will get good dam-
ages if it starts before she gets clear. An-
other inane practice of the average dowager
is to get one foot on the step and the other
dangling over the street, and turn to take a
final farewell, or send a parting message.
Then, if the driver is not looking, she takes
a header and makes a display. The most
casual and easy-going dowager this writer
ever saw transpired on a George-street tram
last week. She bade the conductor “hold
on,” and he held, thinking she was about to
dismount. But she merely wished to tell
the lady who had alighted that butter was
better than oil for frying whiting in. Then
the conductor blew up.

About a “Hospital.”
The Court of Inquiry that is investigating
the ways and customs of Melbourne’s Infec-
tious Diseases Hospital was, at latest, still
asking questions, and getting little informa-
tion in reply. So far, it has been assured
by several witnesses that the secretary had
been on several occasions “blind,” “para-
lytic” and other expressions of the sort,
while other equally reliable individuals have
sworn that on the occasions mentioned he
was as sober as several Judges—which is
obviously several times as sober as one
Judge. Still, it was alleged that in 1908
the committee of management had occasion
to reprimand him and put him on three
months’ probation. The secretary said he
had had occasion to reprimand the engineer
for his language, which was so lurid that one
of his fellow employees couldn’t stand his
society at table, and took his meals in his
own room. The hospital’s “time book” seems
to have been regarded as ai joke, evasions
having been made and entries frequently
omitted when they should have been put in.
As to the lad whose early death and late
burial were the cause of the inquiry, respon-
sibility for the scandal has not yet been
fixed. The hospital’s telephone attendant
apparently got,a daily report naming a few
patients and their progress. The rest were
generally assumed to be “still improving.”
The death of the boy Waters was not
entered in this report, “as it should have
been,” and the doctor, who saw the case was
hopeless from the first, and was duly in-
formed of the lad’s death, “did not refer to
it in his report, and was under the impres-
sion that the relatives had been informed.”
Other witnesses told the Court that bodies
were sometimes kept in the hospital mortu-
ary for several days, and the undue continu-
ance of the deceased excited no remark,
though the fact had been casually mentioned
at the nurses’ breakfast table! The mor-
tuary attendant deposed that he kept no
book or record until quite recently, neither
had he any rules, regulations or instructions
from anybody. He also remarked that he
cleaned out the chamber of death once a
week, though until lately it had been cleaned
at any old time, the job apparently being
no one’s duty in particular. Just here the
secretary was recalled and asked a few ques-
tions, one of which was : “During that week
did you bother yourself at all about the body
being still in the morgue?” To which he
replied: “Well, no.” He also admitted that
this wasn’t the first patient whose relatives
were told he was “still improving,” when,
as. a matter of fact, the victim was actually
lying dead. At latest, the managing officials
were hunting up evidence to rebut Gordon
Webber’s further charges, that newest of
Victorian M’s.L.A. having got into the box
and heaved at the officials charges that the
hospital fire hoses were so rotten as to be
useless; that boots and sundry other
articles of clothing were tossed higgledy-
piggledy into the fumigator, thence bundled
into a store-room without labels, and after-
wards distributed as luck directed; that
damp and dirty bedding was used in the
wards; that a child had been allowed to lie
in a rain-soaked bed under a broken win-
dow ; that nurses and attendants left the
place without changing their clothes; that
the fumigator attendant had his meals,
milked the cows, drove the ambulance and
carried patients while wearing the same
clothes; that dead bodies were humped on
the attendant’s backs past children who
were playing in the grounds; that bodies
were dissected without the permission of
relatives; that one employee at least had
made a statutory declaration that he had
been asked to sign for £2 wages—and did so
sign-—when he had received only £1 Bs. It
is no wonder the officials want to rebut these
allegations. They want rebutting badly.
“Pat O’Maori” has a vision, or a mental
storm or something : —•
There is a small king in Italy who may or may
not be bustling about behind the Balkan trouble
and the irritation in Tripoli, and the annoyance in
Greece and some of the other things which are
making statesmen grey with worry and Cohen
pale about the shekels. The first king of United
Italy was an extravagant soldierly person with much
moustache. The second was a person with more
moustache, a genius for economy, a quiet spirit
and a saintly wife. Both these were large men
with a restricted outlook. The third king is small
enough to be a world-shaker, and has from first
to last shown a disposition to do things on his
own. Some time ago he married a Montenegrin
princess because he liked her, and refused to be
coerced into giving his girl up by all the threats
of his father and his political advisers. Lately,
Italy sought to grab a lump of the old Roman
empire long occupied by the Unspeakable Shirk, and
although it hasn’t made good to any sky-scraping
extent, the spreading of tlic war-flame in the Bal-
kans has probably ensured to it some extension of
territory. The first to raise the standard of fretful
stoush across the Adriatic is that very State of
Montenegro which is linked up in a family way
with Italy’s head person. Thinking it over the
other night, with the fumes of Dago-administered
crayfish in my ear, the whole situation became
as clear as macaroni. I saw a large remnant of
the Roman Empire, where it has declined and fallen
under the whiskers of Islam, kicking like mad
against its oppressor and waiting to be welded again
into something as nearly like the thing it 'once
was as a Sydney oyster palace is like the Roman
forum. Behind the racket I saw a small person
who might be a Napoleon or CaiSAR, or any old
thing, pulling about 7.10 strings very quietly and
cautiously, the while his regal wife flapped round
with a duster, or feather sceptre, or something, and
egged him on to save her countrymen from them-
selves by encouraging them to cut Turkish throats.
It may have been only the atmosphere of the
oysters and things which enabled me to imagine
other things which aren’t, but the time seems to
be about ripe, or the potato cooked, or something
for an upheaval of that part of the world that was
once greatest. Russia and Austria have long been
regarded as the countries most entitled to collect
and add to their dominions the European terri-
tories of the effete Turk, but Italy has a nearer
kinship to half the races of the Balkan peninsula,
and it seems likely enough that the little king
who rules in Rome and his Montenegrin missus
have been fired with the big ambition to cut in
where all others have failed, and gather up a federa-
tion of the noisy and discontented little States into
something which would make Italy a power in
Europe and Italian prestige in the South something
like that of Germany in the North. Was the grab
at Tripoli the first and carefully considered move
in a game which had for its object the capture
of Constantinople, and for its inspiration a dream
of flaunting eagles and imperial purple trousers?
— ;
Apparently Private Enterprise, like the
habitual criminal, is incapable of being
honest, even though it knows the constable
is watching. Years ago it used to sell 10 or
12 ounces of its goods as an alleged pound,
and 150yds. of material as an alleged fur-
long. Then the Commerce Act catne along
and ordered it to label its goods for what
they were, so that when a woman bought a
tin of jam she knew she was getting 270 z.
net, instead of 21b., as hitherto alleged, and
so forth. Private Enterprise kept the law
for a while, but its innate rascality presently
got the better of it. The other day the Cus-
toms authorities in Melbourne reckoned it
was time they inspected the reels of cotton
that this incompetent country imports by the
drayload. They did so. and found that the
frequent “300yds.” on the reel only measured
250, 270, and so on. The “mistakes” were,
of course, due to a “slight error in the manu-
facture,” and there was no intention to de-
fraud ; but the unfortunate part of the matter
was that the mistakes were all in favor of
P.E. That animal never, by any chance,
put 350yds. on a 300 yd. reel. So the im-
porters were coldly notified that any further
shipments of that character would be re-
jected. P.E. is now presumably wearing
its brains out thinking up a new plan for
“getting at” the public.

STRENGTH
SCOTTS
EMULSION
The recuperative and I
strength-making powers of
genuine Scott’s Emulsion
result, not in temporary
improvement, but in the
acquirement of renewed
health and lasting strength.
Thousands of Doctors,
in every part of the world,
recommend SCOTT’S.
Grateful mothers praise
it. Here is an example:
" My little daughter, Molly, wasted to
skin and bone, and was so weak that I
thought she would die I was advised
to give her Scott’s Emulsion, and now,
after a short course of same, she has
grown quite fat and strong, and looks
a bonny healthy child. ”
Mrs. E. Newell, 62, Regent St.,
Sydney. 31.8.11.
Mrs. Newell got the genuine
Scott’s Emulsion—hence the good
results. Further reason why you
should insist on SCOTT’S Emul-
sion—should see the Scott trade

HOW “ANTINEURASTHIN”
REMEDIES NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
It is, in the first place, essentially a food —not a
drug stimulant.
It is a food that feeds the whole of the nervous
system with those elements the lack of which in the
structural tissues constitutes the neurasthenic con-
dition.
It is so easily assimilated that in one hour it is
fully absorbed, thus creating quickly a renewed
mental and physical vigor. This is not mere stimu-
lation, but is really the sensation produced by the
actual assimilation and storage of those refined ele-
ments necessary to nerve comfort and vigor. This
is not—as in the case of tonics and stimulants —a
mere transient whipping up, but an actual addition
to the nerve structure and nerve strength of the in-
dividual. A FREE trial

plaints, and containing analysis of Antineurasthin,

SACAR Woodworking
Machines are British
They are tools of Exceptional Solidity
and Capacity—embodying the latest
ideas for Convenience and High Speed,
consistent with Accuracy. In their
construction nothing is skimped, no-
thing half done, in the endeavor to
produce a machine to sell at “low
price.”
The cheapest consists in what
the machine really is—what it
will do, as compared to others.
Sagar Machines are the cheapest
on the market, although perhaps
not lowest at first cost.
See Sagar Wood Working Machines,
notice the solid frames, the workman-
ship, the convenience of operation, and
the production. From what we
know Sagar Machines are insur-
ance against breakdown —an ele-
ment so prevalent with cheap for-
eign machines, and which quickly
turns a tool into an unprofitable in-
vestment.
If you want service, you want
Sagar Wood Working Machines. We

A. C. Martin: Re “High Prices and Low
Spirits,” you say that the boss always adds 25 per
cent, profit, so that, if the article costs 20s., he gets
25s. (5s. profit). And if, through increase of wages,
the article costs 21s., he charges 26s. 3d. (5s. 3d.
profit). Probably he does when he can. But, as a
j matter that may interest you, the Labor Government
of N.S.W. runs a statistical department which toils
earnestly to give some idea re the cost of the manu-
facturers’ raw material, the outlay in wages
and sundries, the value of the finished product,
and the amount the boss gets for himself. And
the figures show that the boss’s share grows less and
less. When the cost (wages, etc.) goes up from 20s.
to 21s., the manufacturer might like to j)ut up the
selling price from 25s. to 26s. 3d. But when the
miserable tariff makes it easy to sell imported scab
S or sweated or nigger or Chinese goods, so beloved of

Stirred by the breeze the tall trees did sway
While before his campfire a prospector was seated
Sadly thinking of loved ones far away
Armed with a spear an evil black watched him
Prepared to hurl the death-dealing dart
Through the air whizzed the poisonous weapon
Which penetrated the ill-fated man’s heart
From his slumber awoke the victim’s companion
Whom glared at the ghastly form on the ground
Speared by a black he gasped in horror
Raised the body and wildly peered around
From his belt.he drew a deadly pistol
And turned his brow to star jewelled sky
And pledged an oath o’er his lifeless comrade
The cannibal by his hand would Die.

tor’s Oath.”... .Mike R.: You will not wander here.
. . . .Mrs. J.N.D.: Looks like the faded war whoop of
Mrs. Grundy... .Ivor J.: Just wearisome... .Father
of Ten: The Religious Editor was unable to attend
the Synod.' He had been arrested the previous night
in a two-up school... .K.D.: Why worry about the
Maorilander who writes that Ch. Ch. is so vastly
superior in every way to Sydney? Ever since the
days of the Maoriland visitor on this side who said
to his Australian friend, “Ah, you ought to see the
moon we have in Auckland,” that sort of thing has
been a pleasant jest. .. .Coron: Your sentiments are
noble, but your verse is a base-born contraption.
For instance: —
So I hope you’ll concur
Now that I wish to infer
That the imports name is mud.
Walk round that verse three times and then ring
yourself up on the telephone and give yourself your
own unbiassed opinion about it....Pill: In United
States stories most of the male characters seem to
be named Bud or Buck or Huck or Hank, and the
girls are almost all Mamie. The reason of these
things no man knoweth. Also no man careth, though
'here and there some man damneth.... Nomo: Baby
Bonus “poem” to hand. This paper has no desire to
be violent or offensive, so it merely hopes that in
some future state you may be a cab-horse
L.B.C.: Why didn’t you pour your cataract of ob-
jections into the alleged offending publication? The
Bulletin has no special desire to point out that you
are dull or mistaken or both when you deplore “the
antagonistic and prejudiced feelings of Australians
to English people, not merely socially but commer-
cially.” Even Foster Phraser knew better than
that. .. . J.A.McE.: One more Baby Bonus ioke from
you, my man, and our stipendiary fool-butcher leaves
for your home, carrying sealed orders to bring you to
a nasty, sticky end... .McNorth: Your missionary
tragedy is too crude. In fact, you are an imitator
of “Bellerive,” without his streak of genius. .. .
Amber: Consider yourself chucked. In fact, you are
a bounced citizen.... Simplicitas: The question of
whether there is, or is not, a surfeit of toads in
Adelaide has ceased to be a matter of burning in-
terest. As a personal favor, let it lapse. .. .Badnib:
You cannot produce the comic effect by repeating
the phrase, “Yaas, bai Jove,” 14 times a page. There
is a small fortune (a matter of Is. 3d. possibly)
awaiting the humorist who evolves some newer,
brighter and better gag than this for the British
dude of fiction.... Concertina: Sentiment all right,
but verse very• poor. .. .Sniggles (and most of the
population of Australia) : The maternity bonus as a
subject for verse, prose or illustration is at a dis-
count. . . .Dynamo: Verse not up and pars, too thin. . .
R. Arnold: Dreadful verse... .F.J.L.: “Homeland”
is pretty, commonplace rhyme.... J.S.H.: “Young
Love” has been written about several times already.
In fact, it has been better written about more than
758,263 tiroes. . . . J.M.: “City of Dreadful Dust” is
no good either in English or Scotch... .D.W.: You
certainly have a humorous style of writing and a
still more humorous idea of grammar. .. .J.G.F.:
“The Spring Call of the Wild,” which you call an
“original descriptive poem,” fails because it isn’t
sufficiently original, isn’t poetry and doesn’t de-
scribe L.M.: “The Traveller” has promise, “A
Memory” has none.. i .B.B.: “Last Scene of All”
not badly done, but slight and behind time....
G.M.J.: Glad to hear from you, and to know you are
only 23. “Shakspeare” did us all good. Final
stanza: —
Now suggest’s to me a. humorous endeavor
If Bacon a Shakspeare did make
Australians, no doubt would like to be as clever
Then for your dear country’s sake
From feeding on the sheep, you must sever
To batten on the pig for ever.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
H.O’C.: No use Gilmour: Picture received. No
address on it and no gag. . . . J.E.J.: The thing may
be original, but it looks foreign. Australia has the
sundowner and the whaler and folk of that soit,
but the tramp is a different institution. .. .R.T.C.:
Illustrated jest re Johnny and his granny received.
Drawing is not your forte. Neither is humor....
il Chappie: Some character in the drawings, but
they were slain by the pernicious anaemia of the gags.


The Message of Sanatogen
No preparation of its kit'd has ever achieved such
a reputation as Sanatogen.
Many causes have contributed to this unpre-
cedented result.
Pre-eminent among them is the constant prescrip-
tion of Sanatogen by the medical profession which,
as a body, has awarded it the highest praise. More
than fifteen thousand doctors have written in the
most enthusiastic terms to describe the benefits they
have obtained from the use of the preparation
which The Medical Press and Circular states “has
strengthened the physician’s hand a hundred-fold.”
Everyone knows now that it gives
To the Sick —Health
It does this by its power of revitalising the
nervous, vascular, muscular, and digestive systems,
which it rapidly restores from a condition of depression
to one of normal action. By virtue of its composition
—pure milk casein in chemical combination with
organic phosphorus, an essential constituent of the
brain and nervous system—it feeds the brain and
ne ves, it improves the condition of the blood, it helps
the stomach to digest other food, and it thereby develops
and strengthens the muscles. In this way it gives
To the Weak —Strength
and that delightful feeling of returning vitality which
tells the sufferer that he has conquered the disease
which had conquered him, and is once more on the
road to health, and the possibility of taking up his
life again where he had laid it down.
Sanatogen, however, does even more than this.
It has its message for those whom disease has not
touched. Everyone is capable of increased vitality and
vigour. By feeding the vital centres Sanatogen gives
To the Healthy —Vigour
so that work becomes a pleasure, toil becomes enjoy-
ment, and the whole system takes on a feeling of
buoyancy, alertness and energy which is as delightful
as it is unusual.
Sanatogen’s merits have not only been eulogised
by the medical press, and by the medical profession,
but have also been endorsed by hundreds of the bes>
known men and women who have testified to the
cures it has wrought in their cases.
Sanatogen may be obtained from all chemists.
Write to-day for free descriptive booklet by Dr.
Andrew Wilson. Please mention this paper, and

Nice Morning!
It is a nice morning, whatever the weather,
if you start it with Odol-brushing the teeth,
rinsing the mouth, and gargling with a few
drops of Odol in a tumblerful of luke-warm
water. You go down to breakfast with a
palate clear and keen, a mouth refreshed and
young, teeth, breath and gums sound and
healthy. It is a pleasure to chew your food
properly (and thus avoid indigestion).
And under the radiating influence of these
agreeable symptoms you feel nice all over,
nice to everybody, with the result that every-
body is nice to you. A nice morning indeed
if you start it with Odol.

Odol is the most economical of all dentifrices, for,
owing to the concentrated strength of the prepara-
tion and the absolute purity of its ingredients, a
few drops only are sufficient for use at a time.

Hill-top “Christians."
Sophia, Oct. 11.—M. Guesiioff, President of the
Council, in an interview yesterday, stated: the Im-
pending war represents an appalling ransom that we
are going to pay for the freedom of our Christian
brethren.” —Recent cablegram.
On which subject “The Anarchist” speaks
a piece : —-
There are a lot of “Christians” in that seething
stewpan of south-eastern Europe Which is bounded
by the rivers Save 1 and Danube, the Transylvanian
Range, and the wild Carpathian Mountains that
ranching ground of races across which the Balkans
run like the ridge of the carapace of a tortoise.
There are no so-called “Protestants,” it is true ; but
in that cauldron of racial embroilment the adherents
of the Roman Catholic Church take their place as
symbolic of everything which a “Christian” ought
not to be. In many of the little kingdoms and prin-
cipalities, with populations ranging from a quarter
of a million to six millions (vide Roumania), from
a third to a half of the people are Mohammedan;
but everywhere there are colonies of Jews, and occa-
sionally large areas inhabited almost solely by gyp-
sies, whose religious beliefs comprise a . tissue of
extraordinary legends strung together on a thread of
fluctuating superstition. But apart from the univer-
sally hated Roman Catholic (for whose safety Austria
is held responsible) there are as many Greek
churches, each cordially detesting all the others, as
would fill a religious Tower of Babel. There is, to
begin with, the Greek Church proper—the lineal
descendant of the Eastern Church of Byzantium,
which has its centre in Greece and Constantinople,
and the sanctuary of which is the “Holy Mountain”
of Athos. This is called, also, the Orthodox Im-
perial Church, or the Great Church, and includes
the whole Greek-speaking race. But some of the
States in this caloric corner of Europe acknowledge
not this, but the Greek Church of Russia, with the
Tsar as spiritual head, claiming the sacred succession
to Constantine. Roumania has a Greek Church, or
rather two Greek churches of its own, with a
Patriarch of Moldavia and a Patriarch of Wallaehia.
The Armenians who infest the region have a sacred
city and a patriarch at Etschmiadzin. The Patriarch
of the vagrant Syrians lords the spiritual situation
at Antioch. A few wandering Monophysites acknow-
ledge the Patriarch of Diahekr. Visiting Maronite
monks from Mt. Lebanon cultivate an exclusive church
of their own ; while there is a Coptic Church, with
its headquarters at Cairo, and a Church of Georgia,
which dates from the conversion of a certain king
thereof, simultaneously with that of the arch-
diplomatist and Imperial confidence-man, Constan-
tine. These “Christians” are all agreed on one thing,
however, and that is hatred of the Turk. Their
Christianity _ gets no. further than the adoration of
the Cross, and they adore it. generally in its sym-
bolisation as a sword-hilt. When they make peace
with each other it is with a view of dethroning the
Prophet; and when they are at peace with the Porte,
ridiculously called “sublime,” they devote their time
to smoothing out family Greek-Church differences
and harrying the Roman Catholics (nominally under
the protection of Austria) and arranging local loans,
peculiarly collected, from the Jews. The Greek
“Christians” of the Balkan States are an ardent,
primitive people, with a terse faith, which may be
expressed in the words of Cromwell: “Trust in God,
but keep your powder dry.”
Unfortunately, there is dissension in the camp.
The anciently-descended Suliotes and Epirotes, of
Albania, are Moslems, a great section of them, but
they are the children of ason-old Europeans, the old-
time Illyrians, who . embraced the creed of the
Prophet after the death of their hero, Scanderbeg.
But what a fight those same Suliotes put up against
Ali Pasha, and later with him against the Sultan !
With Marco Bozzaris again, in the Greek wa T
of independence, they made dough of many a Turkish
cake. “Christians!” “Our Christian brethren! ” It
it quite true; the category includes “Christians” of
the foothills and “Christians” of the hilltops, who
have taken to heart the motto of Constantine, the
Greatly Mediocre, when he kissed his sword-hilt,
shapen crosswise, and declared, “By this sign I
conquer.” These “Christian” States constitute a
veritable melting-pot of alien strains. There are
Slavs in’ preponderance—Bosnians, Servians, Mor-
laclcs and Croats; and Turks, Greeks, Jews, gypsies
and Wallachians. The last-mentioned call themselves
“Romans,” and trace, or claim to trace, descent
from their “Divine Father,” Trajan, There are
Armenians, Italians, and even Germans, from a shift-
ing and trading population. The Bulgars, of whom
Sir John Mandeville has nothing to say but evil,
when writing in the fourteenth century, are Tartars
who came from the Russian Volga; Ancient Pan-
nonians and Moesians have mixed their blood with
that of the Slavic invaders, and with that of the
Arab and Persian colonists, introduced by the By-
zantine emperors. The Austrian realm is congerie
of races and tongues, but the national religion is
Roman Catholic, and there is no Mohammedan bogey
to inspire perpetual blood-letting among the divergent
peoples. But the races that inhabit the Ottoman
Empire cannot assimilate. l'hey remain as dis-
tinct as when they settled, unaffected by any pre-
dominating national type. Says the historian Free-
man:: “We cannot conceive a Welsh, an English and
a Norman village side by side; but a Greek, a
Bulgarian and a Turkish village is a thing which
may be seen in many parts of Thrace.” Greeks,
Illyrians, Vlacks, Roumans, Slavs, Bulgars, Avars,
Patzinaks, Chazars, Cumans and the terrible Turk
with his turkey-lolly, the sherbet he never drinks,
and the bath he never uses, combine to make up a
hotch-potch of turmoil and trouble over which the
flag of “our Christian brethren” will continue to
wave till the last Montenegrin has devoured the last
Mussulman, preparatory to going forth to wipe out
the last heretic of the. Greek Church and the last
adherent of the Church of Rome.

“Montere” : Canon Garland, who recently
went over from Bananaland to the place
where Maori and Pakeha engage in the pur-
suit of the fleet I O U to convince a dis-.
couraged population that it needed the Bible
in its schools, has been saying some things
which may have a lot more in them than
the thing he went over specially to say.
Here is something he shouted:—
“Three weeks ago, in the Island of Timor, 400 miles
away •from Port Darwin, 23,000 Portuguese soldiers
were required to defeat an insurgent force, and sub-
due a rebellion inspired, I solemnly believe, by a
foreign Power,” said Canon Garland, “for the rebels
were equipped with up-to-date weapons. The ascend-
ancy of a powerful foreign nation in that part of the
world would be a menace to Australia, for Port
Darwin, the key to the Northern Territory, would be
at -its mercy. I do not suggest who that Power is,
but what we have to remember is this: Port Darwin,
the back-door to Australia, is the front-door to the
teeming millions of Asia.”
A canon or any other sort of religious per-
son who observes, orates, declares or other-
wise makes public circumstances of this
kind should be of some, value to the commun-
ity, and his use would be much enlarged if,
in addition, he would whisper in the ear of
Fisher and other persons of his home State
the importance of a righteous railway for
Port Darwin’s defence. George Adam
Smith shows that “righteous paths” in the
very text-book of Faith which the canon
wants used in schools should be translated :
“paths which go straight to their destina-
tion.” The advocacy of righteous railways
of this sort is a straight job for a straight
parson who has eyes to see Northern Aus-
tralia as it is.

BRISBANE.
IN BANANA LAND
“Hobs-o’-Hades” fills in a blank page of
history
His Excellency, being expected at Dryandusty, the
local peerage put their coronets together to arrange
a fitting reception. The town band was retained to
blow the usual loyal strains, and the leading pub,
where the great man was to take his whisky and soda,
went to the expense of rushing up a red, white and
blue triumphal arch. But as the potentate’s car was
crossing the flats it got hopelessly bogged. His Ex.
thereupon got out and hoofed it humbly into town.
The townspeople, having quite made up their minds
that he would arrive in a dust-cloud with a regal
stench of petrol, hardly glanced at the swagless, tired
pedestrian who wandered along and casually asked a
bullock chauffeur the way to the hotel. The chauffeur
directed him towards the back entrance, and thither
the great man proceeded, steering carefully amongst
the bottle and rubbish heaps. When discovered later
by the hotel crew, he had escaped from a great
wilderness of fowls and was having an unobtrusive
wash. And all the time the massed populace was
waiting patiently in front to cheer, and the band had
its breath held ready to burst out through brass in
a hurricane blast of “Gorsave.”
Maryborough (Q.) has just had six
months’ electioneering straight off. In April
last it elected Corser (Tory) by a small
majority. Mitchell (Labor) appealed, and,
after a series of heartrending ups and downs
before the Tribunal, the election was de-
clared null and void. A fresh election gave
Corser and Mitchell 1792 votes apiece, but
a recount landed the former two ahead. Ap-
parently things are settled at last, but there
are doubts. Another appeal may upset Cor-
ser’s miserable majority of two, and start
the town on another godless racket.
Mackay has just distinguished itself by
the finest diphtheritic bout on record. When
the disease had raged for weeks, and rav-
aged some scores of families, the City Coun-
cil discovered that, right in the heart of the
town, there existed a Chinese slum of the
usual jerry-built insanitary order, and issued
an edict that the same should be abolished.
But wealthy landlords interposed. A com-
promise was patched up, with the result that
the slum (which is in a first-class block)
is jigging along as merrily as ever. When
Mackay has bad an outburst of tynhoid. a
touch of small-nox, and a visit of plague, it
may possibly tackle its slum again—-that is,
if the rich landlords allow it.
The Bulletin’s Religious Editor re-
cently wanted to start a League for the
Suppression of Outrageous Hats. T’other
day a lady, who evidently owned one of
these giant mushrooms, wrote to the Q. Com-
missioner for Railways, complaining that the
seats of suburban carriages were “too high
for a lady a large or even moderate-
sized hat.” Next day she received a letter
from the Department, telling her that it
had been decided to build a train with low-
backed seats, in order to remedy her griev-
ance.
What is happening to the Brisbane press?
From being the most parson-ridden institu-
tion in the North it is, apparently, develop-
ing a leaning towards Agnosticism, and even
positive Atheism. The other dav the Tele-
graph, once the white-haired boy of Wow-
serism, broke out: “In these days few of us
believe there is such a thing as a covenant
between man and God.” And some time
ago the Courier published quite a series
of letters with the startling heading : “Is
there a God?” But this was excusable, for
just about that period Fat was badly slaugh-
tered at the Federal elections.
Through the Rain.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As I crossed the flats a-flood beneath the
rain
I seemed to catch an echoful refrain:
“There’s a creek ahead of you
That has drowned a score or two,
And will make you wish you’d cantered back
again ;
It will sing about your ears,
And will mock your dying fears
As it swells in sullen sea above the plain :
Take a hint and get you back
To a safer sort o’ track,
Or you’ll maybe find a coffin in the rain.”
As I crossed the flats a-flood beneath the
rain,
Rang out the surging answer in my brain:
“Don’t you know a tryst is due,
And She waits, a lover true,
And She’s calling now who never called
in vain?
Though the creek were twice as high,
Though it rushed in thunder by,
What care I for its brawling and its bane?
I can hear above the din
Tender tones that woo and win,
And I see her eyes a-sliining through the
rain.”
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, October 19, 1912.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The chief function of the week has been the
Bananaland Art Society’s exhibition at the
Town Hall. For the pride of my sex I
record the fact that, almost without excep-
tion, the larger and more prominent canvases
are the work of women painters. The names
of Gwen Stanley, Vida Lahey and Miss
Macaulay Turner are more numerous on the
catalogue than any others, and Gwen Stan-
ley’s work is perhaps the best of all. But
being the grand-daughter of an artist, she
probably had hereditary advantages. Even
in the befer-drinking competition the descend-
ant of a gifted publican has an advantage
over the man who has merely swatted up the
art by diligent reading or by practising six
hours a day in the threepenny studio. Artist
Harrison, who has lately migrated to Vic-
toria, showed some good portraits, and one
Harvey sent in about a dozen busts and
plaques, moulded from wood, plaster or
bronze, that have been declared first-raters.
The formal opening of the Art Show was
committed on Tuesday afternoon by the
Mayor, aided and abetted by his wife. Later,
they hied forth to organise a hospitals “tag
day.” I don’t know whether “tag day” is
an old game or a new gamble, but I hear
that whenever it is applied or concocted, the
benefiting object becomes a bloated charito-
crat.
After the municipal lady and gent, had
fled from the exhibition, Mr. Thistlethwavte
fed the Art Club and its guests, and remin-
iscened about the early days of the society,
when such lions as Jenner were included in
the art menagerie. Altogether, it was a
cheerful afternoon, and there are not many
cheerful afternoons left. The next one will
be when Premier Denham persuades the
Australian Parliament that he is the proper
person to control the sugar industry in the
North.
Professor and Mrs. Steel shook some 70
paws to-day, the occasion being the opening
of a new chemical laboratory at the Univer-
sity. A delightful feature of the episode
was the total absence of speeches. All the
professors were present, and introduced
their women folk with that bland beam
which stamps the scholastic husband. Gov-
ernor Macgregor was amongst the intel-
lectual, looking all the better for his motor-
jag in the Backblocks.
There are now four sad and sorry youths
in our up-to-date lock-up, with an excellent
chance of explaining to the Law how they
happened to get there. So far as appears,
this is the way and the whence and the
why. A man, from the Solomon Islands,
having told them of the delights of the South
Seas, they hurriedly attempted to reach the
place in a motor-boat, which would have
been right if the boat had not been
claimed by Dan Mactaggart, together with
the stores aboard. But the open sea
was no place for these parlor buccaneers,
and they put ashore or drifted ashore on the
coast under a lighthouse, where the police
found them chewing the bitter cud of a
busted romance. Three of the party were
chauffeurs and the fourth was an immigrant,
which seems an unfortunate trade in many
ways. Of course Daniel Mactaggart may
have made a mistake in the identification of
the launch, but anvhow the lighthouse has
been identified, and the four boys are the
same four.
That mole-like affair, the People’s. Pro-
gressive League, arose from the obscurity of
its hiding-place and proceeded to hold a
theatre party last Wednesday, at one of
the flicker houses. Some of the old hard-
shells, who never heard of. sich. goings-on,
are now preparing their resignations.
Our baby University has cut another
tooth, and it i« known as the Women Stu-
dents’ Club. Yesterday it began business
with a luncheon, and earnestly discussed the
“fors” and “againsts” of University life.
Mrs. Cumbrae Stewart, Mrs. Scott Fletcher
and pretty Mrs. Baker were the only guests.
The others were merely members.
Yours in a budding summer,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
“Kobbi” : Re the barking jackass of Cape
York (Q.), mentioned by “McNorth” (B.
19/9/T2). There is no necessity to so
far afield to hear him. On the Keppel
Islands, off the coast of Central Queensland,
there are flocks of him. Thereabouts he is
known as “Keppel Jack,” evidently under
the impression that he only lives round that
neighborhood. On several occasions lately,
I distinctly heard his distinctive disturbance
off the mainland of Central Queensland. At
the time I put it down (or up) to the herds
of flying dogs that infest this locality. I
may mention that the local people get rid
of them by sending up poisoned meat on
kites. It is very funny to see a poisoned dog
fall from 2000 ft. or so and crash through
the galvanised iron roof of a house. Most
of the locals take these little mishaps in
good part, but others get really annoyed
about it. One unsportsmanlike person has
the roof of his place protected by iron spikes
set close together. It is a dull day when he
does not collect a thunderbolt or a dog or
two.
The Territory and its Calamities.
“Lakrakeeyaii,” more in anger than in
sorrow:—
If the Australian Labor party wishes to make the
Northern Territory a credit to the principles and
practices of democratic government, the sooner
“Jonah” Thomas is thrown overboard the better.
There is but one idea with which Thomas seems to
be possessed, and to which he has from the first
adhered with the tenacity of a weak mind, viz., that
the men who were in the country before! he took to
mismanaging it are either rogues or fools; and, if
they are civil servants, must be got rid of. The
present writer is neither an “old hand” nor a new
one, but has been long enough in the country to note
a few things. In the first place, it is a simple
Minister who in one breath says the Territory is a
glorious white man’s country, and in the next breath
proclaims that when a man has been there 10 years
he is useless. In the second place, there is no part
of Australia where long experience is so essential to an
understanding of the conditions, for the Territory
in the “dry” is a totally different country from the
Territory in the “wet.” Impressions of visitors are
practically worthless, and Parliamentary parties end
in spouts of nonsense. A comparison of the N.T.
officials of the old regime with the crowd Thomas
has sent here is all in favor of the former. Apart
from their superior knowledge of the country and
its conditions, they are, almost without exception,
men who have backed the place with their money—
to their own loss. They are the victims, not the
authors, of the Territory’s stagnation, and have now
the mortification of being penalised and insulted for
A CLOSE SHAVE.
(The whole field, has confidently
appealed for “run out." Umpire's
decision : "No! hou!!)
BATSMAN : “ Close shave, wasn't it?"
UMPIRE (local barber): “Yes, an’ if yer, ’ adn't bin in ther ’abit of 'avin ’ a shampoo
hafter yer l air-cut Ed 'ave said, ‘Next, please!"
the blunders and shortsightedness of politicians who,
even at their worst, were statesmen compared to
Thomas. The new officials, on the other hand, have
no intention of making permanent homes hei;e. The
Minister has given them such liberal salaries and
allowances < one junior clerk gets more than the
chief clerk of his deoartment, who is an “old hand’’),
that they enter gaily upon the work of filling their
pockets with a view to quitting as soon as possible.
The “narrow Territory-bound views” (a favorite
southern sneer a while ago) are that nine-tenths of
the money Parliament is voting and urging Thomas
to get rid of, might as well be poured into the deep
Pacific as be wasted on efforts to develop this country
without a transcontinental railway. The shiploads
of civil servants that are being dumped at Darwin,
and who spread themselves oyer the country, pocketing
their lgs. 6d. and 17s. 6d. a day “travelling allow-
ance,” will accomplish nothing, so long as the country
remains a fortnight’s sea voyage from the head-
quarters of population. The view of the men who
“have the white-ant funk,” and have “been too long
in the country,” is that the iron road to Oodfiadatta
should take precedence of demonstration farms and
a new Government House and much else, but the
“broad” Melbourne view is that developing the country
means shipping cargoes of clerks, and putting “vice-
regal” frills on Gilruth.
So far the record of Commonwealth adminis-
tration has been a succession of fiaseoes. First came
the farce of aborigines protection. That some such
measure was necessary none will deny, but as most
of the natives are living away from the settlements
and in their native state, it is not such a big matter
as would first appear. Surely the advice and ser-
vices of men experienced with' the blacks and familiar
with the country was a first necessity. There are at
least half a dozen men in the Government service
in the N.T. who have made a special study of the
question, and whose knowledge and experience have
proved useful to such makers of books as Baldwin
Spencer. Their advice was not asked, and every
Territoriar. who applied for employment was turned
down. A brand-new department was shipped from
Melbourne, the chief qualification of the staff being
a blank ignorance of the blacks and the country. As
the “protectors” were all strangers, the blacks near
the settlements (who most need protecting) soon
made themselves scarce, and as the Act under which
the Department works is a masterpiece of despotic
legislation, the protection the niggers most need now
is against the Department. It is the Wowser, par ex-
cellence, of Government Departments—raising clouds
of dust and making no progress, creating the maxi-
mum of irritation to blacks and whites alike, with
the minimum of practical good to any. That sexual
immorality, grog and opium were doing deadly work
with the blacks we all agree, but there is 'not an
iota less of any of these evils since Thomas began to
splash round with his expensive new toy. All that was
needed was the strengthening of the police force and
the setting apart of some such experienced man as
Stbetton to the office of Protector. Thomas talks
virtuously at Pleasant Sunday Afternoons as though
the N.T. nigger was a brutally-treated unfortunate
until he (Josiah) became his foster father. Rot!
His Aborigines Department was first a scandal, then
a laughing-stock, and now a contemptuously ignored
institution. At its worst it has deported N.T. young-
sters (against their will) to Westralia, consigning
them to the tender care of the philanthropic squat-
ters. At its best it is teaching the nigger to be even
lazier than Nature made him, and to depend upon a
beneficent Government to feed him without the trouble
of doing any of the abundant work available. But
perhaps the principal occupation of the Department
is attending to the matrimonial affairs of the nig-
gers—divorcing the unworthy, marrying and giving
in marriage according to convenience. It ought to
be called the Department of Aboriginal Dove Affairs.
The next joyous incident was Gilruth. Where
did Thomas get such an inflated idea of the genius
of this horse-doctor. As all other applicants were
turned down, and Gilruth was given the position
on his own terms, it might have been expected that
there were some special and unmistakable qualifica-
tions concealed about him. The Territory accepted
Gilruth at this valuation, and received him with
open arms. There was not a note of discord in the
cordial acclaims with which he was welcomed. Now
the Territorians, Tory and Labor alike, suspect that
there could not have been found a man more utterly
unsuited for the post. The “strong” man turns out
to be merely a bad-tempered man. The large-
minded statesman sets to work making children
hustle into school at 8 a.m., trying to bully the
priest into making a denominational school con-
form to the same hours,, and generally bumping
himself against the four corners of things simul-
taneously. Up to date, Gjlrutii’s chief concern has
been Gilruth —-his comfort, and, above all, his
precious dignity. To uphold and magnify the dig-
nity, there is a private secretary, or detective, or
nursery maid or lady’s help, who is paid £350 a
year as a civil 1 servant, and is chiefly occupied
teaching people to lisp “Zexcellency.” What would
Andy Fisher think of the Government House ball
recently given by his representative here? Invita-
tions were headed with a gold crown —the envelope
bearing the same device. The local pedagogue had
instructions to strike up “God Save the King” on
the piano when Zexcellency and “Madame” made
their appearance. The crowd gaped in astonish-
ment. There were two supper tables—one for his
Ex., with just a few others to keep him in coun-
tenance, and a larger table outside for the herd. But
if he is ridiculous socially, as a manager of men
Gilruth is likely to be a calamity. With about
10 0 men in the Government employ he has made
chaos. Give him a few thousand on railway con-
struction, and he will make Sheol.
The Transcontinental line, as speedily as possible
and by as direct a route as possible, is the first,
word in the conquest of the Territory, and until
that word has been spoken, the pious platitudes of
Thomas and the bombast of Gilruth are but “fill-
ing the belly with the east wind,” or something
equally unsubstantial.

FORTY-NINTH REPORT.
Presented to the Shareholders at the Ordinary General Meeting oil 30th October, 1912,
The Directors have pleasure in placing before Shareholders the annexed Balance-sheet and Statement
of Accounts for the Half-year ending 30th September, duly audited and certified.
The net profits (including £3943 6s. Bd. brought from last Half-year)
amount to .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. £26,407 9 3
Which it is proposed to deal with as follows, viz:—
To pay a Dividend at the rate of 8 per cent, per annum . . . . . . £12,000 0 0
Transfer to the Reserve Fund (making it £180,000) .. .. .. 10,000 0 0
And to carry forward the balance . . .. .. .. . . .. 4,407 9 3
£26,407 9 3
The business has been well maintained during the Half-year, but no special effort has been made to
extend it—the Directors thinking it advisable to keep their funds well in hand in view of the somewhat
stringent position of the money market, and accordingly it will be observed the cash reserves are very
ample.
The Directors would once more impress on shareholders that they have it in their power to materially
improve the business if each will do what he can in the way of introducing desirable accounts; their past
efforts in this direction are greatly appreciated by the Board.
By order of the Board, H. T. WILSON, General Manager.

THIS IS THE

THAT the purchase of this Biograph
is a safe and profitable investment
is proved by the fact that numbers
of biomen are replacing their old ma-
chines with it.
Travelling biomen especially find it a
wonderfully efficient and economical ma-
chine, embodying all those features which
are essential to a good biograph—com-
pactness, strength, reliability, durability.
It is absolutely silent in operation, and
renders the pictures without a flicker.
It is fitted with the Maltese Cross

HAVE YOU A BAD LEO
with Wounds that discharge or otherwise,
perhaps surrounded with inflammation and
swollen, that when you press your finger on
the inflamed part it leaves the impression?
If so, under the skin you have poison which
defies all the remedies you have tried. Per-
haps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated, the same with the ankles, x-ound
which the skin may be discolored, or there
may. be wounds; the disease, if allowed to
continue, will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hos-
pitals, and been told your case is hopeless,
or advised to submit to amputation, but do
not, for I can cure you. I do not say per-
haps, but I will. Because others have failed
is no reason I should. Send to the Drug

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them —the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to haVe done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. . They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
.you have lost
ithe h e a r i ng-
nerve co m-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
.regret trving the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The nrice is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
' sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
j inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
| pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
i not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

SOEREOI4 YEARS
Itched and Burned. Skin Came Off,
Leaving Them Raw. Tried Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment. They
Soothed from the First and Cure
Has Stood Test of a Dozen Years.
“For fourteen years I suffered with my
hands. The skin came off in patches, leaving
my hands raw. They itched terribly and if
I rubbed them, water oozed' out, leaving
them worse than before. My thumbs and
first fingers were the worst, the skin came
off, leaving a red, smooth surface. They
itched and burned terribly. Other parts of
my hands became affected, the skin first
drying up and peeling off. They were drawn
together and I could not grasp anything.
“I tried various ointments, but they did
me no good. I went to five different doctors,
having medicine and ointment from each, but
all to no purpose. One of the doctors told
me they would never be cured, another said
the oil was all dried up out of the skin.
Not one gave me any hope of ever being
cured. A friend thought one of my fingers
was withering away. I tried various oint-
ments recommended by friends, but they all
failed to cure. After some time, a friend told
me about the Cuticura Remedies, having tried
them with success for hands similar to mine.
I tried them, and I found that nothing had
such a soothing and cooling effect. They
acted wonderfully, and I noticed the sooth-
ing effect from the first. My hands were
completely cured by the Cuticura Soap and
Ointment. It has stood the test of a dozen
years. It was wonderful, I never saw any-
thing like it. Other members of the house-
hold have benefited by it, and we are never
without a box.” (Signed) Mrs. Alice Blomley,
129, Durham St., Rochdale, Eng., Jan. 3,1911.
The first warm bath with Cuticura Soap
and gentle application of Cuticura Ointment
are usually sufficient to bring instant relief
permit rest and sleep, and prove the first steps
in a speedy, successful and economical treat-
ment. Cuticura Soap and Ointment are sold
throughout the world, but a liberal sample
of Cuticura Ointment, with 32-page book on
care of the skin and scalp, will be sent free on

The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Hair-Growing Compound.
10,000 FREE
TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling Jiair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the. top of my head was quite bald.
1 had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time-— : yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the. human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantitv of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having- arrange'd for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world—l am
not interested in decrying others—but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

Cora Brown-Potter (the Gown Trotter of old), who
toured Australia with liyrle Bellew, has joined the
Theosophists, and, as the London papers*put it, “is
leaving- the stage for the psychic platform.” The
stage left her some time ago, but it didn’t leave her
for the psychic platform. Ever since she was a
girl, so she declares, she has “craved for a true
Hindu to show her the light.” At last, when she
was urgently in need of something to remind the
world of her incomplete deadness, she has discovered
“a Hindu preceptor who understands Gosainthan
occultism.” This dark mental lantern has already
made her “understand the vast difference between I
and My and the bridge that spans the gulf.” Pro-
bably he has also explained to her why icicles do not
grow on devils, and how it is that you can’t balance
loose boiling water on your eye. Cora alleges that
Gosainthan is “a temple in the Himalayas, 17,000 ft.
above the sea,” also that “no white man has ever
been within 50 miles of its sacred precincts.” When
next Cora comes to Australia it will doubtless be
clad in white, a la Annie Besant, when she will gibber
about the true Inwardness of the Murky and the
esoteric significance of less than 2d.
Frederick Wedmore, novelist, journalist and travel-
ler, has published a volume of reminiscences. He was
a dramatic critic in Bristol in early manhood, and
he has some pleasant things to say of the Terrys and
the Rignolds, including our own well-beloved George
and his brother Bill. Also, he knew Henry Irving, whom
he describes as “simple, modest, chatty and unaffec-
ted. ’ Wedmore mentions an early Melbourne actress,
Mrs. Charles Young, who came to Bristol with her
second husband, Hermann Vezin. In the opinion of
Hermann, Wedmore did not praise his wife suffici-
l|e wrote to the editor charging the critic
with being 1 “over head and ears in love” with a cer-
tarn other actress who was mumming in Bristol at
the same time. Hermann Vezin, although an accom-
plished actor and first-class elocutionist, was so can-
tankerous and ill-tempered that managers found it
convenient to ignore his existence. During the last
.i Ve j lS P f , his life 11 e had ver y few engagements,
and devoted most of his time to teaching stage
aspirants of both sexes. h
“Hullo”: I hereby enter my selection for the worst
photo-play m existence. Saw it the other night in
byclney. It is an English production. The film told
us that The Australian Actor returns to his Cabin. ’
the idea of the English producer was that, after a
crowded season in Dungog, the Australian star hur-
ries home to his cabin in the Never-Never Said
cabin was an ordinary stage room. It appears that
his daughter, who, during her father’s unavoidable
absences in the metropolis of Dungog, keeps the Red-
skins from scalping the domestic goat, has fallen in
love with two youths. Under her father’s direction
she writes the same letter to each, telling them to call
the following afternoon. The next scene shows an
English Jane, along which a coster pulls his little
cart, stacked up with what look like willow logs. It
is evident that he carts this wood across the bound-
*ess plains of the west, and sells it to the shivering
squatters. The Australian actor arrives, disguised hi
a stage beard, and arranges with the coster to place
nim beneath the tiny cart. He is supposed to have
been upset and crushed and killed and severely in-
lured. Exit coster and enter the first suitor, who is
strolling through the English scenery dressed like a
London bank clerk, or worm. He passes by on the
other side, like the Priest and Levite on the metalled
road to Jericho. Then enter the second suitor, who
wears no collar. His name, of course, is Jack ; and
•lack rescues the apparent old man from beneath the
wheelbarrow, which weighs about 21b. Next we aie
told that the bank-clerk “forces his attentions on the
actors daughter and offends her.” His offence con-
sists in chasing the girl all over the cabin. Jack
comes in time to rescue her. Then, according to t.h -
screen they are interrupted by “the arrival of a
brigand from the bush.” Said brigand looks like
one. He is the Australian actor, still more disguised
by still more heaps of beard. He is overpowered by
the collarless Jack, while the bank-worm cowers in
he tpvper mf the cabin. Then the screen announces
the father s decision: “You’re the boy, Jack. A
strong right arm and a kind heart!” This is the
English photo playwright’s idea of Australia. It
should be immediately. secured for use at all our
schools.
“Vic.”: The Ballarat competitions include a Scrip-
r,ess,av ? n *7" he , Teacilln §' of Christ.” Awards
just declared and referred to in Ballarat Presbytery,
from which the prize of £2 2s. emanates. A mem-
ber said there was a difficulty in collecting this large
sum of money last year, tie hoped there would be
none now. Another member: “Let Moderator Thom-
son be appointed collector.” The Moderator: “No,
Two years ago I was collector, and had
l* 1 ' 1 all out of my own pocket.” Laughter
ensued. Mr. Rain was then appointed collector, and
handed in donations of eighteenpence
each. How these people do dash money around!
A journalistic hint from Germany. There is a
newspaper in that land of Kaiser Bill that prints on
one side only. This policy enables. the other side to
be used for wrapping up provisions without the bacon
and butter being spoiled by printers’ ink. A native
paper in tile Deccan (India) is printed on a square of
white cotton cloth. After (he readers have perused
its contents they utilise it for the rest of the day
as a. pocket-handkerchief. Then they send it to the
local laundress and it returns a clean white sheet, to
be used again for newspaper purposes. A London
speculator 80 years ago started a daily handkerchief
punted on calico, and sold at 4d. It was an attempt
to evade the 6d. stamp duty on newspapers, but it
didn t succeed. The daily wipe blew out.
“Oldest Inhabitant”: The prologue to the “Re-
venge,” played in Sydney’s first theatre on January
16, 1796, alleged to be by Barrington, was generally
supposed to be by Captain Collins, Judge-Advocate,
and author of an early History of New South Wales.
That the piece was ever spoken by Barrington, or
spoken at all, is extremely doubtful. Some years ago
Mr. Alfred Lee, a well-known Sydney man, and an
enthusiastic collector of Australiana, was mooching
round the old bookshops of London, and came across
an old calf-bound volume, consisting of two books
bound together. The .fifst was of no interest; the
second was “Original Poems and Translations, parti-
cularly Ambra, from Lorenzo de Medici, chiefly by
Susanna Watts, London, printed by Nichols and Sori,
Red Lion Passag-e, Fleet-street, for F. and C. Riving-
ton, St. Paul’s Churchyard, and Sold by all Book-
sellers in Leicester, 1802.” In the volume are several
prologues ’ by “A Gentleman,” including “one suit-
able to be spoken on any occasion,” and then Lee
found the prologue attributed to George Barrington.
Lee sold his collection to the late David Scott Mit-
chell, and his “find” is now in the Mitchell Library.
Collins mentions the performance of “The Revenge”
and the farce of “The Hotel,” but makes no allusion
to the prologue.
“Star” : It was during the travels of a peculiarly
combative grand opera company in Australia —a com-
pany that averaged nine fights a week, and turned a
manager bald-headed in a single season. The com-
pany was raving in Melbourne for the second time,
and at a critical juncture one night the hapless stage
manager came thundering from “behind,” plunged
into a seat in the office, and sat babbling like an
infuriated anthropoid. “What do you want?”
snarled the great boss of the show. “What do I
want?” shouted the stage manager; “I want change
for a tenor.”
All , Henry Irving’s biographers up to now say he
made his first appearance at the Lyceum, Sunderland
(England), in a small part in “Richelieu,” his tutor,
William Hoskins, having given him a letter of intro-
duction to the manager of that theatre just before he
(Hosk.) sailed for Australia. But it has lately
been discovered that Irving made an earlier and most
inglorious debut at Sadlers’ Wells Theatre, North
London, at the time that Samuel Phelps was drawing
playgoers from all quarters to that out-of-the-way
old barn by his brilliant Shakspearian revivals.
Hoskins, who was a leading member of the co., per-
suaded Phelps to give young Irving a trial in a
small speaking part, but Irving made such a mess of
it that Phelps sacked him on the spot, told him
to stick to liia stool in the wine merchant’s office,
and warned him never to enter a stage door again.
At Sunderland, too, Irving broke down on the first
night through nervousness or stage fright, and was
unable to utter a line of his part. It was a dismal
beginning, but Hoskins had great faith in young
Irving, and his confidence was well-founded in spite
of initial disappointments.

Mrs. Bellafrs’
FOUR-MONTHS OLD BABY.
(From a photo.)
“I have never come across a soap like Rexona Skin and Facial Soap
for babies,” writes Mrs. Maud Bellairs, Stoke Street, Townsville, Q. “My
baby is now four months old, and I have been using Rexona Skin and
Facial Soap since his birth, and it has made his skin as soft as silk and
clean and healthy. It has also taken off a rash of prickly heat and pre-
vented the cradle-cap coming on his head. He sleeps well during the day
and his hair is growing quite curly. There is no one who could wish for a
better baby than mine. I would not attempt to use any other soap except
Rexona Skin and Facial Soap, as it does not smart nor chafe like other
soaps do. My nurse recommended it to me.”
REXONA Soap for Health 8 Beauty.
Rexona Soap is as
sweet, wholesome and
pure as the mountain
dew. To use it for the
daily bath, or even to
wash the face with it, is
to furnish the skin with
a tonic and antiseptic of
unquestionable value.
Rexona Skin and
Facial Soap is a refresh-
ing, Soothing, Healing,
Antiseptic Soap, medi-

ciple as the famous

those credit balances. Now the Government has
drawn upon them to the extent of £3,370,000, ana
probably more, if we had the London balance by

CHOKUS OF LOANS.
Citizens, your Loans behold!
Timid, trifling things were we
In the sluggish days of old —
Little dwarfs of £ s. d!
Now, we loom up, big and bold,
Homing to the sheltering fold —
Speeding swiftly o’er the sea!
You must feed us well with gold —
See the new recruits enrolled!
See their banners flying free —
lOU AND YOG OWE ME !
Enter Premier McCohen —
What’s here? What do I see? They
make me tremble. Innumerable horde!
I will dissemble!
Yogngest Loan (approaching timidly) :
Father !
Premier : Off! Off! I know you not;
{Aside) Great Rothschild! What a lot!
Second Youngest Loan :
Father, you are forgetting!
He is of your begetting ;
And I —and he —and he; we are not jest-
ing ;
Oh! spurn us not, I pray!
You’ve only got to pay —
You’ll find us really very interesting!
Premier :
I—l —l’m blither-—er — astounded!
And wholly confounded!
My wrath is unbounded!
How dare you regard me as father ?
Third Loan :
I fear we distress you;
I thought we should bless you !
You may pay us, you know, if you d
rather!
Premier:
Pay you? Pay all these loans? How
many are there of you?
An Old Loan (in a deep voice) :
There are about £104,000,000 altogether,
not counting what’s to come!
Premier {in a faint voice) :
I—x —will c-consult. my colleagues, and
er—see what can be done in the matter.
Enter Principal Dun ( loquitur ) :
Good, Mister McCohen! Good! I can
be Dun in the matter! ( Leads forward
£7,000,000 Loans due this year.) How
about starting with this little lot?
Premier : Er —I’ll see what Cann —
Principal Dun :
Exactly. But meantime the family’s in-
creasing. Look at those little Loans
slipping in there!
PREMIER:
But they’re not all mine, I tell you!
Those old, grey-whiskered chaps, for
instance
Principal Dun :
Well, but you’re responsible 1 , you know.
You’ve known ’em for 30 years, and
helped to age ’em. They ought to be
retired at once, and they can’t be retired
without paying ’em.
Premier: Er — Ah! —I’ll make them a
speech; shall I ? They might be re-
newed. Cann can arrange? Well—
My dear little boys and girls—er —er—
er— —
Several Loans :
He thinks it’s a Sunday-school! Now
for a treat!
An Old Loan ( solemnly ) :
One—hundred —and —four millions ! And
some of us are very old, Mr. McCohen,
very, very old!
Principal Dun :
There you are! They must be retired!
Premier {hastily) :
Well, I’ll give them a prayer—no! We
will all join together in singing the dear
old hymn, "The Time is Ripe.” (Sings.)
The Time is Ripe for change—
If any change there be —
It’s very sad and strange,
This dearth of £ s. d.!
Our Loans are falling due,
The Treasury is bare,
And for my lOU
Bull doesn’t seem to care!
The market has been raked.
Yet little it affords;
With thirst for gold unslaked,
Old loans arise in hordes!
The time is ripe for change!
Election day is near ;
Hope’s getting out of range,
And things are looking queer!
Mv little bark is beached —
The tide has ebbed away—
The Limit has been reached—
For we are asked to pay!
To pay, O Lord! —A feat
Beyond all mortal bounds;
For who can hope to meet
A hundred million pounds?
Principal Dun :
Amen! But you’ve omitted the final verse.
Premier :
No —I don’t think so. That’s all I know.
Principal Dun :
Pardon me. (To Loans) : All sing it to
him, please!
CHORUS.
Extravagance and waste
Their course have nearly run;
When all the facts are faced,
McCohen’s rule is done!

THE MUNDY SUN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AS you are looking for sermons m
stones,” said the barman, “I’ll tell
you about Mrs. Mundy’s diamond.
The weather outdoors was gnashing its
teeth with unaccustomed fury, and the gu -
ters were tumbling over the footpaths
their mad haste. The customers blistered
grateful shins against the bar radiator. 0
one offered any objections. „ . ,
“We called it the Mundy Sun, Patrick
Mackaboy continued, seating himself on the
counter in affectionate contiguity wi 1 m
spirit stove, “and it blazed on the expansive
shell-pink bust of Mrs. G. Dunstable-Mundy,
a widow twice removed, and still a mighty
liuhtress before the Lord. She was putting
up at The Lotus, a sedate Sydney house that
once enjoyed a monopoly of my invaluable
service and unexampled tact for a short
season. T
“The Lotus was a model of decorum, it
was almost ashamed of being an hotel, kent
its bar in the background, and permitted
Rechabite texts in the best bedrooms. For
all that, it was a going concern, and a
popular resort for the middle-aged and the
ailing, much frequented by prosperous, pas-
toralists from Barracoolong and Pinbingie,
professional men of means from the languid
towns, and other voluptuaries with sore feet.
“I never met so many sore feet outside
the theatrical profession. There were always
several great men at dinner with their toes
done in bundles. You heard the padded
hoof-beats in the passages all night long. In
the smoking-room five or eleven opulent
squatters, with their muffled heels gingerly
set up on adjacent chairs, looking like some-
thing home from the laundry, sat from early
morn to the midnight hour, explaining to each
other in what manner the Labor party was
hounding the country to the devil, sir.
“Mrs. Dunstable-Mundy was highly ap-
preciated by the old bucks. You did not
look for frantic excitement at The Lotus,
but when the giddies started getting out and
up and downstairs after the large pink
widow, each slinging a foot like a newchum’s
bundle, things brightened up, and there were
moments when I did not yawn so as to quite
engulf my back stud.
“Of course, the women drew back their
heads, and looked at Mrs. Mundy over then-
lean beaks with the cordiality of the indig-
nant hen; but the women were the wives,
sisters and maiden aunts of the great aggre-
gate Bumble-Foot, and were distinctly en
suite. Consequently Mrs. M. found then-
scorn refreshing on the whole, and took a
sun bath in it whenever she felt a trifle
pipped. ~ , ,
“The widow was not at all bad. There
were hints and indications that it was a
herculean task, and an engineering feat of
no little skill, to lace and brace her into
shape of mornings, and her maid. Margie,
had biceps like a Hungarian wrestler; but
Georgiana Dunstable-Mundy caged a little
purple devil in either eye, that peered and
mocked at you between the bars of her
drooped lashes. There was a splash of color
in her cheek, and a dash of ginger in the
swinging way in which she would fetch and
carry her extra freight. A portly woman is
only deplorable when she gives way to it,
but Georgiana bore up like a fine galleon,
with flying flags and a band on the poop.
“I liked Georgiana Dunstable-Mundy
from my insignificant position in the swill,
and it did not surprise me to see old Swollen
Toes ambling on her track. _ If I had been
a superannuated Croesus, drink barred, with
a wheezing on the chest, and one foot in
swaddling cloths, it would have pleased me
too to nestle on the warm side of a boun-
teous comforter, of Georgie’s proportions,
and make believe I was alive.
“Perhaps the diamond helped to lure a
few of Mrs. Dunstable-Mundy’s friends. It
was a blazing stone, not half the size of that
decanter, and was set on a long, slim pendant
fashioned simply like a torch. From my
knowledge of precious stones, I should have
said it was worth £5OO or £7OOO. The widow
wore it whenever she put on evening cos-
tume. and Georgiana had a fondness for
decollette gowns, so that the Mundy Sun
was much in evidence, inviting the attention
of connoisseurs to the superior texture and
tone of the surrounding epidermis.
“Everybody assured Georgiana that the
diamond would be stolen. Bryant, who \vas
managing The Lotus, contracted a mild
form of neurasthenia through worrying over
the massive trinket, and was up nine times
a night to. shoo imaginary burglars off his
licensed premises. But Mrs. Mundy only
laughed at their fears.
“ ‘There’s a ready sale for diamonds,’ said
she; ‘and I know what to do with mine
when I’m afraid to wear them. I’ve got to
get £lO,OOO worth of satisfaction out of
these, and I can’t get that sitting in a cold
vault with an armed guard on the door.
Precious stones are to throw at your neigh-
bor, and I throw mine every chance I get.’
“The Mundy Sun and other gems Georgi-
ana scattered over her ample surface were
supposed to be the remains of a vast accu-
mulation of geological samples belonging to
the family of the late Horatio Dunstable-
Mundy, whose original ancestor was in with
William the Conqueror, and had availed him-
self of all the opportunities.
“Georgie’s most faithful attendant was a
tenderfoot named Randolph Hann, .T.P., who
trod the earth cautiously, his left foot being
parcelled off and swung from his neck in a
sling. On yonder hills his father fed their
flocks, and Randolph was giving it out in a
thick whisper that he had more cattle than
an active man could count in a year. He
was a fat, incapable person with ailments.
You could hear him breathing a week off,
and he had a face like a puff ball with some
trifling features thrown at it.
“Hann was a widower in charge of twin
daughters, who were 35 or worse, and pain-
ful to behold. Mary had the sort of face
that would appeal to a man who would use
a plain pudding for a mural decoration.

MISHAPS OF
•CHILDHOOD
Zam-Buk is the Mothers Friend.
Healthy youngsters seem to be always “in
the wars,” cutting and knocking themselves
about, and sustaining bruises and gashes, the
sight of which often make their mothers turn
their heads in horror. Just what every home
needs is Zam-Buk. A pot of this Balm and
a bandage on a handy shelf, where they are
ready for immediate use, save untold pain,
time and money.
Mrs. C. Hedges, Cash Store, Ravenswood,
Queensland, says: “I have used Zam-Buk
Balm on my little daughter for cuts and
bruises, and it gives me pleasure to testify
to its valuable healing qualities-. The effect
of the first application was very soothing,
and continuing to apply it, the child’s wounds
were speedily healed. I have also tested its
powers on myself for a deep wound in the
foot, caused by a nail, which obstinately re-
fused to heal, but Zam-Buk effected a thor-
ough cure. I have recommended Zam-Buk
Balm to my friends, and its success has
been equally pronounced.
Every Home Needs Zam-Buk.
Zam-Buk, the ever-ready Healer and Skin
Cure, is invaluable for Cuts, Burns, Bruises,
Pimples, Blackheads, Sprains, Abrasions,
Scalds, Scalp Troubles, Poisoned Wounds,
Piles, Eruptions, Boils, Running Sores, Chil-
dren’s Sores, Eczema, Abscesses, Shaving
Sores, and all injured and diseased conditions
of the skin.

Colic, Diarrhoea and Dysentery
Are diseases that require immediate attention. In almost every neighbourhood
someone has died from these diseases before medicine could be procured or a
physician summoned. p
Those who rely upon physicians often find that they are away from home when
most needed.
Every family, and especially those who reside in the back blocks, should keep
at hand a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic & Diarrhoea Remedy.
No physician can prescribe a better medicine for the purpose for which it is
intended. It is invaluable for both children and adults.

Jane’s resemblance to her sister invited pub-
lic sympathy.
“While Hann, J.P., yarded sumptuous
Georgiana among the pot plants in the
piazza, his short, corpulent daughters stood
off and loathed her. But no woman could
get any real heart-comfort out of despising
and hating Mrs. Dunstable-Mundy. The
diamond which blazed upon the widow’s
bosom like a buckler of ‘brazen studs and
tough bull-hide,’ or a miraculous chest pro-
tector, turned aside the bolts of malice and
blunted the shafts of scorn. Withering
glances cast at a woman behind a diamond
like the Mundy Sun were about as effective
as soft-boiled eggs heaved at the original
Sphinx. Every perfect lady in the place
knew it was so, and grieved over the fact.
With diamonds enough, a woman can live
down anything. If I were a doctor I would
recommend diamonds for all female com-
plaints.
“Mrs. Dunstable-Mundy’s diamond stood
for aristocratic pretensions and great
wealth. It was an undeniable credential at
The Lotus, and conferred such prestige on
the wearer that she rose superior to criti-
cism. Georgiana’s knowledge of this im-
pelled her to keep the flashlight about her,
and cast the beam in her sister’s eye on all
occasions.
“ ’Twas one hour and 40 minutes past mid-
night when the drowsy hum of the sleeping
host at our superior family hotel was pene-
trated. and dispelled by a piercing shriek.
The simile of the stirred anthill won’t serve
to describe the manner in which a crowded
residential flat is affected by wild cries in
the dead of a dark night. The ant in his
moments of greatest agitation knows what
he is after, and breaks in one direction for
the escape door, but uncle, when he is called
up in the gloom with the idea that the bas'e-
ment is afire, there are burglars on the roof,
and murder on the stairs, behaves like some-
thing that has just had its brains ampu-
tated. He tries to walk through a window
with the wardrobe under his arm, or re-
peatedly bats his dilly head against the
walls.
“In my rush along the corridor I met
one fat lady escaping with three pillows
and a wash-basin; two old bumbles trying
to push their faces through two foot of
welded brick ; another struggling desperately
to tow an iron bed after him down the
stairs; and an eminent authority on rams,
with an extinguished candle in one hand
and a revolver in the other, looking for the
fire.
“The screaming came from Mrs. Dun-
stable Mundy’s room. It took us 27 minutes
to elucidate the mystery. Mrs. Dunstable-
Mundy had swallowed her diamond.
“Georgiana was distracted, but while I
was away, collecting four or five doctors,
Bryant extracted something in the nature
of evidence from the frenzied lady. She put
the Mundy Sun. in a glass of water on the
washstand, having been assured that the
brilliance of diamonds is enhanced by con-
tinual _ submersion. Being a-thirst later, she
arose in a half-sleeping condition, and drank
the water and the diamond. She declared
with every manifestation of moral and
physical anguish that she had felt it go down.
“Well, for hours the full strength of the
medical profession was out after that dia-
mond. This was prior to the day when the
M.D. could light up your unexplored interior
with X-rays, con your most jealously guarded
mysteries, and find a baby-pin in 100 yards
of winding intestine. The profession was
working in the dark. Results were nil.
“Next day I had a peep at Mrs. Dunstable-
Mundy. She was ghastly and as limp as a
feather bed. Her face was the color of wood
ashes, and a dire apprehension haunted her
eyes. She told Bryant that she knew she
had only a few days to live.. The earnest
assurances of three expensive physicians
failed to shake Georgiana’s conviction that
her finish was at hand. There was not a
hap’orth of dash left —no pretence, not even
a smack, of vanity. Only a misshapen
widow with a pasty complexion and the in-
tolerable fear of God in her heart.
“ ‘l’m going to die!’ she said.
“ ‘Nonsense, nonsense, my dear lady.’ said
the medical expert. ‘Why, bless my soul,
I’ve saved a woman who swallowed a china
door-knob.’
“ ‘l’m going to die!’ Georgiana persisted.
‘And I’ve been a wicked woman.’
“Mrs. Mundy stuck to her point, and in four
or five days the idea that she was ticked off
for a sad end was generally held. She
looked it. I would never have believed that
a fine, swaggering widow of 40, with the
necessary worldly goods, and abundant high
hopes, could have been brought to such a
piteous pass in so short a time, had I not
beheld the decline and fall of Georgiana
Dunstable-Mundy. She took to her bed, and
was so resolute about dying that she
had to be taken over by a certified clergy-
man of the Presbyterian section, whose duty
it was to prepare her to head a picturesque
procession up the golden stairs.
“At this stage there were confessions. The
maid Margie was my informant. Mrs.
Mundy had admitted, for the comfort of her
soul and the improvement of her chances
hereafter, that the late Horatio left her the
sum of £256 per annum, which represented
her sole earthly possessions. The missing
jewel was distinctly and decidedly Brum.
Not only was the gem paste, but the setting
was a brazen deception. In this manner
Georgiana’s sin was getting back on her.
It was the corroding of the base metal in
the depths of her being that was bringing
about an unseemly and premature finis.
“On being advised of these further facts,
the general practitioner recalled a quartette
of specialists, and the motion in favor of an
operation was carried on the casting vote
of the chairman. Georgiana was removed
to an adjacent private hospital to await the
opening ceremony.
“You’ll notice I get dragged into these
things. Possibly it was because of my kind
eyes, or perhaps because Bryant was away
and every other man in the hotel had greasy
heel, or elephantiasis of the hoof, and
couldn’t run to catch grubs. Anyhow. Miss
Mary Hann sent for me in her hour of need.
The summons was urgent.
“I waited on the spinster in her own
apartment. She looked like a mass of tissue
paper that had been left in the rain, as she
flopped there on the carpet surrounded by
wet handkerchiefs. There was no sparring
for an opening; she waddled across the room
on her knees and embraced my ankles.
“ ‘Oh, you will; you will, you will!’ she
wailed.
“I said certainly I would —anything in
reason.
“ ‘Save her! Save her!’ sobbed the hap-
less maiden.
“I promised to do it, on my honor as a
barman and a brother, if she would supply
name and address.
“.Then she opened her heart to me, and
three minutes later I was chasing that briny
cataract downstairs, with no more ceremony
than might be displayed in ejecting an un-
sound cat. I rushed her into a cab. We had
nine minutes to make the hospital, and
made it.
“I trundled Mary into the infirmary as no
gentleman would gallop a breathless and
untrained lady in distress. Mrs. Dunstable-
Mundy was already on the operating table,
I believe; but such was the impetuosity of
my charge that Miss Hann was instantly
projected among the startled operatives.
“Here Mary told her sordid story all over
again, and I was given to understand that
Mrs. Georgiana Dunstable-Mundy sat up as
Heaven made her, and said those things to
the collapsed spinster pickling in her own
tears, which, however impossible before a
mixed audience, are permissible, even admir-
able, in exceptional circumstances and during
moments of intense spiritual exhaltation.
“Georgiana was not operated on, and
Georgiana did not die. I saw her a few
weeks later in Pitt-street, looking remarkably
fit, and carrying her trim bulk with a saucy
swing again. This was the day following the
receipt of the cheque that settled the breach-
of-promise case, Mundy v. Randolph Hann.
“You will have guessed that, whatever
else Mrs. Mundy swallowed (perchance a
nutritious frog of a kind then frequently
met with in Sydney mains), she had not
swallowed the Mundy Sun. The fact is, Miss
Mary Hann had crept in while the proprie-
tress was enjoying a hot shower, and provi-
dentially stolen the resplendent gem.”

(according to the old Greek song) is to
woman), deceit is to the Bengalee... .Elab-
orate tissues of circumstantial falsehoods,
chicanery, perjury, forgery are the weapons,
offensive and defensive, of the people of the
Lower Ganges.” Quite a large number of
Australians will cheerfully endorse Mac-
aulay’s sentiments and extend them to the
regions of the Upper Ganges whence hail
our Bakblox hawkers; and the Australian
who does not endorse them, but judges our
dusky fellow subject more leniently is yet
prone to adopt the attitude of supercilious
pity of the Yankee who sang—
The pore, benighted Hindoo,
He does the best he kin do:
He sticks to his caste from first to last,
And for pants he makes his skin do.
But I am digressing. The Hindu is, un-
doubtedly, a delusive dodger, but, as a first-
class hypocrite, the white man of a certain
description can give our colored brother a
close run for his money. Witness the de-
meanor and utterances of our fellow Euro-
pean (of a certain type) when taking an
oath: —
Counsel: Do you believe in God ?
Witness: Of course I do.
Counsel: Do you know what will happen if you
tell a lie?
Witness: Yes. I will go to Hell and be punished
for ever and ever.
(Very often the witness doesn’t believe any
such thing, and demonstrates his disbelief
by perjuring himself immediately after the
above asseveration.)
Contrast now the utterances of Ram Dass
when similarly interrogated. I quote a case
that actually occurred :
Ram Dass (in reply to counsel) : Yes —I tell lies
Everybody tells lies.
Counsel: Like you are now ?
Ram D.: Yes. You tell lies yourself sometimes.
Counsel: Do you believe in God ?
Ram D.: Yes.
Counsel: What will happen to you if you tell lies?
Ram D.: I get plenty money—just like in Bengal.
Probably the above-quoted assertions of Ram
Dass made up the most truthful statement
he had ever made in his mendacious exist-
ence.
Take again our black brother Warrigal,
who is called upon to give evidence on a
matter concerning his white boss in a Far
North cattle-stealing case :
Counsel: Do you understand the nature of an oath’
Warrigal (grinning) :My oath—Yes !
Counsel: What would happen you, if you tell lie’
Warrigal (cheerfully) : Me go Tonga big burn fire.
Counsel: But what would happen if you tell the
truth ?
Warrigal: Oh, then—Boss lose ’em ease!
Of the three witnesses whose notions re
the obligations of truth-telling are revealed
to some extent in the foregoing patches of
dialogue the aboriginal was truthful to the
extent of 50 per cent.; the Hindu was abso-
lutely veracious in his minutest asseveration
—for he admitted he was a liar; said fur-
tliGr with David that dll men were liars; and
candidly confessed that he was going to fib
vigorously for money. The white man, on
the other hand, professes a belief in an eter-
nal hell, and immediately proves his dis-
belief therein by committing perjury. If, as
Bernard Shaw says, Parnell was the most
truthful man in the House of Commons,
because he fearlessly told the Court in the
I igott case that he made a certain incor-
rect statement in Parliament purposely to
mislead the House, whereas Ministers of the
Crown and ordinary M’s.P. perjure them-
selves every day and never own up to the
perjury—if this be so, then Ram Dass, the
open, confessed and undiluted professional
prevaricator, is leagues ahead of Bill Smith,
the candid Caucasian, who violates the im-
mortal truth every day in our Law Courts,
his solemn Bible oath notwithstanding. In
tther respects, Ram Dass is a wild, weird un-
shaven nuisance concerning whom one can
truthfully sing:—
Our brother is a man of Sin ;
Our brother is a Ganges worm ;
He was meant to grub for money in a placid land
and sunny,
And give shelter to the homeless germ;
But—we shudder in a bright young land
At our brother from the Coral Strand,
Our brother with his dirt and his animated shirt
And the bundle in his unclean hand.
