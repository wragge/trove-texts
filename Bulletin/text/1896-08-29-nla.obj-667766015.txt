Lawson’s Prose.
Angus and Robertson reprint by permission and
issue in admirable form Lawson’s prose tales and
sketches from The Bulletin and other papers
l odpp., ctoth-bcmm!, mailed free from Bulletin
oitice to any address in Australasia far 5s. 6d. in
Btamps or post-notes).
* ,• • •
Certainly no complaint has to be made on tho
score of quantity : there is some as to quality, and
* good deal as to arrangement.
Many of Lawson’s sketches are written in
series,: there is a ‘"Mitchell ” sequence, a “Steel-
man sequence, a bush sequence, a city sequence,
and so on. The obvious way of dealing with
these was the best way. They should have been
classified and put in sections, so that continuity
might be unbroken and the characters might gain
force and distinctness from the massing of impres-
sions. Exactly the opposite course has been fol-
lowed. The book is like a bad cook’s ragoht.
You get here a mouthful of salt, there one of
pepper, the next is meat uncondimented. Not
? , Y V* Power lost, but the haphazard mixture
jolts the mind like an unexpected bottom-step.
The pity of it is greater because
with the best arrangement the
matter would seem scrappy and
disconnected. Written for occa-
sional publication, these detached
sketches have no unity of idea
or treatment. Their appeal was
bound to be diffused and vague :
the least that could be done was
to concentrate the interest as far
as the slight skeins of similarity
permitted, and instead of half-
a-hundred taps to strike half-a-
dozen blows. It was not done.
Lawson might conceivably have
written many of his fragmentary
impressions into a single plotted,
climaxed story which would make
a permanent mark. Or if even
he had contrived a set of charac-
ters to pass from chapter to
chapter, as Mark Twain manages,
and hung his matter on their
pegs, his result would have been
stronger. As it is, the reader
is perpetually getting-up steam
for a five-minutes’ journey which
brings him back to starting-point.
And only half-a-dozen of these
sketches—as printed—are some-
thing like literature. The rest are
frequently good journal - work,
good material for literature—no-
thing more.
* * *
Yet the standard for criticism
of Lawson is rising as he rises.
We ask from him better tilings
than we asked a year ago. Hither-
to he has only had to make a
reputation-with his endowments
an easy task : now—O labor of giants ! —he has
to maintain it.
And Lawson’s public reception has been quite
equal to his deserts. Even iiis first poor booklet
(printed by his mother, Louisa Lawson) met praise
instant and generous; his volume of poems has
been noticed by a hundred critics anxious to forget
blemishes, keen to discover beauties; the rolling
snowball of his fame has been kicked onward by a
thousand eager feet. Thanks in part to this zealous
ardor, there is not a corner of Australia where his
name is unknown ; not a town in which he will
not find some strange hand stretched to «rip his,
some honest face shining with pleasure to greet
the poet of the bush.
What a change since Gordon’s day ! When
that poor baffled idealist blew his brains out in
the covert of the Brighton scrub, his talent was
hardly known, certainly unappreciated by the
mass of Australasian readers. Clarke says he
died “in the full flood of his success, with con-
gratulations pouring upon him from every side.”
But Clarke referred all things to the standard of
Collins-street. His world was Melbourne, with
an occasional extension to the Wimmera bush.
And outside Melbourne—or, on a liberal estimate,
Victoria—Gordon at his death was practically
unheard-of. A few sportsmen, a few literati,
made the circle of his admirers: his fame is
purely posthumous. The quickening of the Aus-
tralian literary sense in the past ten years is won-
derful to look back upon. Now, if there are not
many to detect new talent, there are very many
able to appreciate it when detected and ready to
chorus enthusiastic welcome.
Of this quickening Lawson and Paterson and
the others of the new bevy of bards and writers
are reaping the fruits. But reputation, like
rank, has its responsibilities. If Lawson’s is not
to wane, he must wax continually.
* * * *
The charm of Lawson's prose is essentially that
of his poetry. Art he has none; his artifices
are of the feeblest. For the most part he might
say with Antony ;
I only speak right on ;
I tell you that which you yourselves do know.
But what others merely know, Lawson feels. He
is indeed abnormally sensitive : the trifles which
make evanescent impression on ordinary minds
draw blood (and ink) from his. Then ordinary
minds with pleasure recognise their own impres-
sions. “ Why, these are our thoughts; these
people are our people ; these scenes and places are
the scenes and places we have known for all our
lives.”
Precisely ; yet until Lawson pictured, revealed,
and vitalised them, those thoughts, those people,
those places and scenes never really existed for
ordinary minds. Which is, of course, but a varia-
tion on the well-worn apothegms that beauty is in
the eye of the gazer, that we get out of everything
exactly what we put into it, that one man’s meat
is another man’s poison, and the rest. The ordi-
nary mind lives all a life behind horn windows :
genius has invented glass. Its senses are acute to
the point of ecstasy; it sees the rays of the human
spectrum to grosser eyes invisible ; like the beau-
tiful Norse god Baldur, it can hear the grass
growing. And Lawson, as before enunciated, has
a touch of genius.
His instincts of assimilation and selection are
“ The y have been toeing about her for three hours." (Illustrating “ A Day on a Selection" in Lawson's
book of prose sketches.)
matched in his later work by his instinct of ex-
pression. His quaint simple style suits his
rhemes and mode of thought. And his manner is
strengthening. The happy word and phrase come
to him easily : the incidents fall without effort
into place : his picture is made before he knows.
Lawson is beginning to find himself.
Yet his impressionable mind often reflects the
color of the medium through which it has been
flowing last. There are hints of Bret Harte and
Dickens in his earlier work ; of Mark Twain and
Bulletin humorists in his later. And the work
is none the better for them. Regard for Lawson’s
reputation would, indeed, have excised a good
half of the book—especially stories in which the
pathos is deliberately manufactured, like “ Arvie
Aspinall’s Alarm Clock ” ; and valueless sketches
like “ Bogg of Geebung,” with similar imagina-
tive effects ; and undistinguished journalism like
“For Auld Lang Syne.” The remainder, in their
class, would be very good indeed : asitis, thelevel
of the volume is a long way below its best pages.
Not the best, but the most promising are those,
which tell “An Unfinished Love Story.’’ Here,
for the first time, Lawson ceases to describe
characteristics and starts to create ciiaracters.
* * * *
Mahony’s drawings are mostly good, and they
really illustrate the priut. Two, by permission of
the publishers, are reproduced in this issue of
The Bulletin. And, as it has not been said
before, it may be said now that “While the
Billy Boils ’’—which is the disconnected name of
Lawson’s disconnected book—is chock-full of in-
terest for Australasian readers, and worth five
shillings of any man’s or woman’s money. And
it will be easy for intelligent people themselves to
make the quotations which, did space permit,
would here be given to justify and elucidate these
diota.
Is nob the intellectual cream of Melbourne sup-
posed to rise near '‘The Book-Lovers’Library ” —
whose list of August-added books is nearly all
novels, most bad ones ?
Notes.
Sydney’s new journal, The Block, is very
nicely printed, but it is not the model paper. For
one thing, it is not cocksure and dogmatic enough.
When the millionaire is found (“ In the beginning
was a millionaire ” will be the first line of the
model paper’s gospel) and the model paper is
founded, cocksure dogma will be of its essence.
That is to say, it will so consistently use its own
thinker to do its own thinking that the enormous
majority of persons who mentally live by fifth-
hand opinions alone will be irregularly knocked
flat by the wind of its fluttering pages. Irregu-
larly—for the model newspaper will be movable
in space and time: the millionaire alone will be
fixed. That is to say, when there are no topics
and the staff has no ideas the paper will stop issue
until ideas and topics come along, and even at
other times its size will range from a leaflet to a
volume.
Further, the model newspaper will go on circuit
like the law-courts. There is rarely more than
one topic of leading national importance on the
carpet at one time, and the model paper will seek
that topic where it may be found, and fall upon it
while it is yet near. The editor and his assistants
will migrate to Melbourne, or Auckland, or
Hobart—or wherever the Dean case of the day
may be—and be in readiness to write up the
Nocent Waterspout on the spot, eftsoons as it
rises. Of course, the model newspaper will not
chronicle the petty currencies of local gossip, or
discuss the petty problems of local interest. ’ It
will employ the best minds of the day on national
questions and permanent questions, and its
articles will be signed, and its writers will say
what they darn well please and take the responsi-
bility as long as the matter’s interesting. And—
many other things, all dependent on the million-
aire. Can anybody oblige with a millionaire?
The recent Burns eruption threw curious light
on the periodicity of the human mind. It is
generally recognised that before you can draw a
bucketful of water up the ordinary pump you
must pour a dipperful of water down. Similarly
unless you bribe the ordinary intellect with an
anniversary, you may pump till your head is tired
without getting one responsive idea. Put a cen-
tenary in the slot, and the populace will work.
The peculiarity is plainly an aboriginal trait —
the mark of a juvenile stage of individual- and
race-development. You meet it in the woman
who repeats obituary poetry in the papers on the
anniversary of some relative’s cjeath, and Woman
is nearest the juvenile and aboriginal type. And
you are confirmed in the diagnosis of it by recol-
lecting that anniversaries such as birthdays and
wedding-days are most significant to children and
women the most intellectually backward among
individuals; while anniversaries such as Sunday
and Christmas are most significant to the most in-
tellectually backward M i>•< > n rr races.
And, indeed, from in, cultured point of view,
a death-centenary would seem a gruesome cele-
bration, were not the instinct of its gruesomeness
dominated by the more deeply-rooted instinct of
its anmversariness. From a cultured point of
view, there is absolutely no reason why Robert
Burns should be specially remembered at the end
of 100 years rather than at the end of 101, or 99, or
58, or any other arbitrary period of what we call
time. And, goingstill further, if Burns had really a
message of value, every cultured mind should
have absorbed it and be permeated with it all the
time, and the significance of anniversaries would
be lost altogether, since every moment would be
as significant as every other.
This follows from the doctrine of association of
ideas. The wiser a man grows, and the more ex-
tended his culture, the larger becomes his stock of
concepts, and the more numerous the connections
between them and the images presented to his
mind. Thus, a baby looking at a flower may per-
ceive that it is red. An uncultured man may
know that it is red and round and odorous and is
called a rose. Alice adds that it is good to wear
and matches her gown ; Marmaduke that it costs
sixpence at the florist’s; and so on. But a cul-
tured man knows all that literature has said about
roses; he reads in the blushing petals the poetry of
humanity, and hears as he gazes the ecstatic song
of the bulbul:
Sweet, ever sweeter, sweetest Love hath been:
Shirin, Shirintar, 0 Shirintarin I
And the really wise man, looking, sees and is
reminded of so much more that it is evident that
at the apex of culture and the extremity of wis-
dom to which we hope we are tending the least
mental impression derived from any source will
suffice by association of ideas to callnip the whole
thinkable uni verse from the storehouses of memory
and imagination. So that we are really binding
ourselves to a lower race-standard when we worship
days and times and seasons, and we make a crab-
like and degenerate leap by merely honoring our
poets a hundred years after they die instead of
bringing them into our hearts and living with
them and honoring them every moment.
P.S.—Perhaps Burns is an exception, though :
think of Haggis all the time !
P.P.S.—No, lie isn’t; think of whisky all the
time—the compulsion to celebrate a Burns anni-
versary (and all the other anniversaries) every
moment! The imagination here reels.
[Plainly, it is time to lock the imagination up
as drunk and disorderly.]
Several correspondents testify to the existence
of another privileged ring at Melb. Public
Library. “Atone time files of periodicals were
repeatedly short of last numbers, in consequence
of trustee leader-writers borrowing them; and
books were constantly missing for the same
reason.” And, “looking for any attractive book,
you find continually that it has disappeared in
hocus-pocus fashion. Not long ago I missed ‘La
Pucelle/ ‘ The Scarlet Letter ’ and ‘ Tom Jones.’”

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
get ting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until X became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney."
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the hack and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my bo3' had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Taimvorth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly provn its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
59 other leading residents.

He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.

The
Reliable
Disease Is an effect, not a cause. Its origin
Is within; its manifestations without. Hence,
to cure the disease the cause must be removed,
and in no other way can a cure ever be ef*
fected. Warner’s Safe Cure is established on
lust this principle. It realises that
95 PER CENT.
of all diseases arise from deranged Kidneys
and Liver, and it strikes at once at the root
of the difficulty. The elements of which it is
composed act directly upon these great organs,
both as a food and restorer, and, by placing
them in a healthy condition, drive disease and
pain from the system.
For the innumerable troubles caused by
unhealthy Kidneys, Liver and Urinary Organs;
lor the distressing Disorders of Women: for
all Nervous Affections, and physical derange*
ments generally, this great remedy has no
equal. Its past record is a guarantee pf
continued performance.

When you go out shopping, consider, think
of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-
tation in the form of a pretty show ; there is
B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and 0,
who says that he is the man for your money ;

The Campfires of the Lost.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Who will may see, on plains around
By scanty rivers crossed,
Where none but weedy growths abound,
The campfires of the Lost.
To fan the blaze, the twigs and cones
From dying Hopes we tear ;
And wolfish Angers gnaw the bones
Of dead Ideals there.
And effigies of sacred things,
Or bric-a-brac of Fame,
Anon a stern-lipped watcher flings
Remorseless to the flame.
To drown your glory in the dark,
O, children of the Light !
The frail, the crushed, the fell, the stark
Deploy their hosts to-night.
Grim scouts o’erlcap your city’s walls,
Oast potions in your wells,
With leprous patches taint your halls,
And mine your citadels.
Your timid treasurers await
The onset of our need ;
The .myriad tramp his lonely hate
Is whetting with his greed.
Your serfs now mocking greet your cries
Of “ honor,” “ law,” and “ trust ” ;
Your lily women recognise
The prowling lips of Lust.
Your veil of Art, by free winds tossed,
Is rending as you look—
Your Art, which claimed to love the Lost,
And jeered them, and forsook.
Your brutal Science yields a corps
Of derelicts, to train
With formulas of lethal lore
Our nascent rebel brain.
The scavengers of Learning there,
And outcaste lords of rhyme
Compose us anthems of despair,
And polyglots of crime.
And godless phalanxes assist
Our priesthood celebrate
A diabolic eucharist
With chalices of hate.
Your system’s ripened fruits appear
In vampire and in sot;
The tiger women wait you here,
You soiled and left to rot.
See there a squeezed-out sponge of trade,

SATURDAY, AUGUST 29, 1896.
The Beak and the Dead.
Victoria has longhad, and deserved, therepu-
tation of being one of the most snuffle-ridden
provinces of this continent. It is a land of
sour Sabbatarianism and aggressive Calvin-
ism, where the saints who have strong
orthodox views about the damnation of in-
fants are supreme. Its famous boom and
its wonderful burst are both monuments to
the holiness of Victoria, inasmuch as all its
worst frauds were engineered by the pillars
of the church, and almost all its prominent
men who ought to be in gaol, were, and still
are, notorious for their infuriated piety.
Victoria has more bitter orthodoxy to the
square inch than any other spot in these
provinces, South Australia alone excepted ;
and an element of snuffle and mediaeval piety
pervades not only its laws but the method of
their administration, and the pious J.P.
rages exceedingly in the land. Down in
Victoria they still occasionally bury the late
suicide secretly, and at night, with a vague
idea that it makes God feel better to see
the remains of the person who has died con-
trary to the views of the great associated
Podsnap hustled around with obloquy after
dark, and the Victorian J.P. probably
makes more severe remarks about the
suicide than all the rest of the Australian
magistracy put together. The latest case of
the kind turned up last week, and read as
follows :
During an inquiry into the suicide of the nonagenarian,
reported in Wednesday’s Age, the coroner, Mr. W. W.
Greene, P.M., expressed himself as strongly opposed to
the frequency with which juries attributed a suicide’s
action to unsound mind. He ordered that the body be
buried between 9 p.m. and 12 midnight, in accordance
with the powers given him by the Act.
» * * •
This sort of proceeding, of course, does no.,
harm to the deceased, and, so far as he is
concerned, it might go unnoticed. The spec-
tacle of a blatant magistrate jumping with
the large feet of his mind on a person who is
dead and therefore can’t defend himself, may
look foolish and indecent and in the worst
possible taste ; but as the person jumped
upon is probably beyond all knowledge of
the matter his share in the incident may be
passed over. The P.M. who has “strong
views ” about the conduct of the dead, and
orders his insensible dust to be hauled around
in a specially insulting fashion in a feeble
attempt to get level with him, is a natural
product of the law which authorises such
things, and the law is the natural product of
the spirit of public snuffle by which Victoria
is pervaded. In a certain low, degraded sense,
however, the Victorian procedure is more
logical than that of the other provinces. In
all the Australias the parson-ridden law re-
gards suicide as a crime, and when any citi-
zen attempts suicide and fails the law runs
him into gaol for a longer or shorter term to
bring him to a better frame of mind. If the
man wlfo only attempts suicide is a criminal
the man who actually achieves it would be
naturally regarded as a still worse offender,
and as he can’t be imprisoned for three
months, owing to very obvious and unpleasant
reasons, the only way in which the law can
express its opinion of him is to offer a special
insult to his remains. In New South Wales
and other provinces, the unsuccessful suicide
is imprisoned, but nothing happens to that
worse offender, the successful suicide, except
that he is allowed to remain dead. Vic-
toria, which is more logical in its illogicalness,
carries the proceeding to its natural termina-
tion by trying to follow him into another
world, and shakes an impotent fist at him
across the Styx.
* * * *
Some day it will probably occur to the Aus-
tralian nation that its entire attitude on the
suicide question is foolish and ridiculous, and
that the law dealing with the matter is an
anomaly, and that the administration of it
tends to make the bush J.P. even a greater
fool than he is by nature. The matter is
not in itself of any great importance, inas-
much as the old view of the question is
a relic of parsonical bigotry and intolerance,
and a scrap of the dreary superstition which
has kept the world more or less in chains for
centuries. There is absolutely no direct or
reasonably indirect scriptural condemnation
of suicide, and the Bible, which is supposed
to be the foundation of this country’s law
and morals, nowhere prohibits it. The gene-
ral feeling against it is partly a survival from
the old fighting-days, when it was every
man s duty to kill somebody else, and suicide
meant the loss to the tribe or nation of a
valuable individual who ought to have been
better employed in killing somebody else
before he died. It is partly a survival of
the days of slavery, when every man be-
longed to somebody else, and suicide meant
the destruction of valuable property ; conse-
quently, there being no other*way of influenc-
ing the suicide, the Church, as the friend and
agent and protector of the propertied classes,
announced that hell was the inevitable con-
sequence of self-destruction. Further, there
is a social prejudice against suicide because it
often tends to destroy the carpet, which is also
property ; and because it is sudden and in-
artistic, and uncomfortable for the people
who find the body, and it often throws the
expense of the funeral on persons who are
quite unprepared for it. Moreover, if there
is no hell for the suicide, then for whom is
there a hell ? And if there is no hell for
anybody, then what future is there for the
Church, and the collection-plate, and all the
rest of the sacerdotal establishment ?
* * * *
If suicide is any crime at all, then it is
murder ; there is no other heading in the
decalogue under which it can be included.
In that case, attempted suicide is attempted
murder, and the punishment should be 10 or
15 or 20 years' penal servitude, or there-
abouts. If the Church isn’t prepared to
demand that attempted suicide should be
treated in this fashion, then it gives away its
whole case. If the State isn’t prepared to
put attempted suicide on the same basis as
attempted murder, then it has no criminal
basis to put it on. The administration of
the law is fully as confused as the law itself.
If the suicide fails in his purpose it holds
that he was of sound mind, and fully
responsible for his actions, and it sends him
to gaol for seven days, or a month, or there-
abouts. It does this, either with the idea
that a man who isn’t afraid of hell will be
scared out of his evil purpose by gaol, or
because it thinks a person- who is too
miserable to care to live any longer will be
c l ie ? l . U P a ud made to take a brighter view
by a residence in a luxurious stone
building ; or because a month’s confinement
is its idea of a fair equivalent for attempted
murder ; or because it feels that it is a fool
in a cul-de-sac, and it has to do some-
thing, and can’t give a reason for doing
it. But it sticks with intensity to
the theory of the unsuccessful suicide’s
sanity, because otherwise it would have to
confine him in a lunatic-asylum for an in-
definite period, and it hasn’t sufficient faith
m itself to accept the responsibility. On
the other hand, when the suicide succeeds in
his purpose it almost always declares, with
or without evidence, that he is insane,
because its dismal orthodoxy alleges that the
suicide who is sane goes to perdition, and
the average bench hasn’t sufficient faith in
its orthodoxy or in its own perdition to make
such an assertion. Moreover, it is an un-
comfortable thing for any bench of gentle-
manly instincts to say about anybody, and it
might lead to retaliation from the deceased’s
big brother; so the average magistrate in-
structs the average jury to lie as politely as
possible about the late-lamented’s state of
imnd and the general decision seems to be
that it the deceased was sane enough to kill
limself scientifically then he was insane, and
if he was so insane that he didn’t know how
fished hmiSelf ’ then hIS san % is f ully estab-
To the credit, or discredit, of Victorian
law, it is much more given to facing this
difficulty than is the law of any other Aus-
tralian province. In Victoria it is a matter
of frequent occurrence for the suicide to be
planted secretly by night on the ground that
he killed himself with a full knowledge of
his sin, and is Lost, according to the good
old parsonical phrase. Then the back-blocks
J.P., who naturally knows all about it,
solemnly closes the doors of Paradise against
him, and orders his corpse to be treated with
disrespect according to law. By all the rules
and regulations of orthodoxy the deceased
has vanished into the infinite, and from
where he is the globe on which a small, un-
considered beak is making severe remarks
about his clay isn’t so much as a speck
against the background of the blackened
sky, and the matter affects him as little as if
somebody had a low of him in
Jupiter. The only excuse for the stupid in-
sult and the lugubrious midnight burial is
that it may hurt the feelings of the suicide’s
surviving relatives, and some other possible
suicide may possibly give up his purpose for
fear his midnight burial may hurt the feel-
ings of his relatives—in which case it seems
that the surviving relatives should be flogged
or beheaded in order to make the deterrent
as effective as possible. Or possibly there is
a shapeless idea in the mind of the illogical
beak that somewhere in eternity and infinity
the defunct may hear of what happened to
his remains, and feel aggravated in the
neighborhood of the Milky Way; or more
probably there is no idea at all in the magis-
trate’s vacant intellect, and he only acts as he
does for the same reason that a cow looks
over a gate in the afternoon. The law of
suicide and its administration are equally
tangled, and there is no sense or logic in
them.
* * * *
The shortest and simplest process is for
the code to cease the futile attempt to deal
with a subject which is beyond its reach. It
should give up trying to decide whether the
suicide was sane or insane, for the sufficient
reason that he is gone beyond its jurisdiction
and is never coming back—at least not in
any shape which it can recognise ; and his
state of mind is a matter which is not of the
slightest use to it, and to pry into the ques-
tion is mere'gratuitous impertinence. It
should also give up the foolish attempt to
wallop the dead, and to shake its fist across
the Styx at a ghost which may not be there,
and to throw an imbecile little brick at Pro-
vidence, by offering cheap insults to the
suicide s dust. It is illogical, for one thing ;
for another, it is the meanest kind of
cowardice to attempt injury to a person who
is down and will never get up again ; and it
is the worst kind of foolishness for the com-
mon J.P. to know more than the Scripture
on which Ins alleged religion is built. So far
as concerns the suicide who succeeds, all that
the law wants to find out is that he is quite
dead and that no person save himself is
lesponsible. As regards the suicide who
taifs, it has a right to repair him to the best
of its ability, on the off-chance that he may
.have changed his mind and may want to be
repaired ; and to charge him with the bill for
medical attendance, and hold him civilly and
criminally responsible for any injury he has
done, by bloodstains or otherwise, to any-
bodyeise s property—and there its respon-
sibility ends. It doesn’t know where the
successful suicide has gone, or where the
unsuccessful one was going to—even the
Church doesn t profess to know where the
place is situated that it says he was
going to. If there is any such place,
and he was going there, the place
m question doesn’t belong to the law, and
it nas no authority to warn anybody off the
grass. What the State knows about the
beyond is that it drops the convicted mur-
derer over the edge into it, and the depth is
so great that it has never yet heard the thud
o his arrival there ; and beyond that all it
knows is that it knows so little that it doesn’t
dare to teach the subject in its schools for
fear it doesn t know anything at all. And
this information is hardly sufficient to justify
it in stating definitely whether its citizens
should go there—wherever it may be—or not

girl after ten, and rub her down with a large
fatherly hand, and inspect her to see what her
probable age is, and offer to let her off the in-
dignity of being taken through the streets in

herself agreeable. He can further inspect her
with the aid of the policeman on the next beat,
and the two can ask her in a paternal way if
she is respectable, and if she doesn’t know the
meaning of the term they can explain it to her,
and they can jointly examine her to see if she
really seems to be over 16 or not. Then she
can be hauled up a back lane to the house of a

left there in charge, as an individual suspected
of being steeped in the Worst kind of depravity j

severely about the assumed evil of her ways,
and exhibit her to her family as an awful ex-

capture. If the married person doesn’t
happen to be of such good repute as the police-
man says he imagined her to be, other things
may happen as well. If the policeman escorts
his prey home in custody, the small boys of the
neighborhood will probably join the procession,
and make offensive remarks as they go. The
whole business is calculated to fully enlighten
any girl as to a great many things which she
didn t previously understand, and it provides in
a large and generous way for her being pawed,
and examined, and interrogated by almost
everybody. And, as the only restriction is that
the policeman must think the girl is under 16,
and as the average policeman is capable of
thinking almost anything, there is a great deal
of interesting employment ahead for ihe force.
The people of uneasy virtue are having a really
fine time in Maoriland just now.
Divorce by Mutual Consent.
Ihe frequency and comprehensiveness of the-
plea of “ desertion ” in Hew South Wales,
divorce-suits tinge deeply the suspicion that,
“desertion” frequently means “collusion.”"
Which adds another degree of relevancy to the-
question—Why should not collusion be made-
an openly valid and tenable ground for granting;
a divorce? Why need perjury be added to-
collusion to enable unhappy couples to be-
legally sliced apart? Why should not the-
mutual agreement of any wedded pair
that their particular marriage has proved a.
failure be the best of all grounds for dis-
solving the partnership ? Any such a case is
not a matter affecting public interests. It is.
the wedded disaffecteds’ own affair. The
State has nothing whatever to do with
any religious ideas imported into the
marriage relationship ; in the eyes of the
law, that is merely a civil contract, and, like-
other contracts, can be mended or ended—
mended by a judicial separation ; ended by a.
divorce. If a religious faith impels one or
both of a married pair to hold binding views;
regarding matrimony, they are free to be boundl
and are not bound to be free. All that the-
State should consider is the desirability of
liberating fools who have fallen into their own
neis, and the necessity of seeing that the
children by a marriage are provided for. Man
and wife should possess the right to go before a
divorce Judge and say : “ See here ; we’re sick
of each other; neither of us wants to go and
commit any of the statutory offences of adul-
tery, continued drunkenness, felony, cruelty,
or desertion ; but one of us will have to do one
of those things if you don’t divorce us right
off.” And the Judge should be able to say :
“ Fees, please; or certificate of poverty. You
are divorced.” What more cogent reason can
there be for the cancellation of a civil contract
—and the law holds marriage as a “civil con-
tract ” only, which is why “registrars” are
endued with full splicing powers—than the
desire of each party to the contract that it
should be cancelled ?

The Kanakaland Bank.
Brisbane Worker is pegging away at the
thesis that the Q. N. Bank ought to be examined
and disinfected before the Govt, swallows it.
It has unearthed a variety of interesting infor-
mation concerning the bank’s transactions with
its political shareholders, and their transac-
tions with the public funds, and the continual
disappearance of the public funds in the re-
cesses of the bank ; and just now it is drawing
attention to a remarkable change (long ago
noted by The Bulletin) in the certificate given
by the bank’s auditors. Up to 1892 the Q.N.
Bank audit certificate read :
We hereby certify that the above is a true and correct
statement of the affairs of the Queensland National Bank,
Limited, on [such-and-such a date]. (Signed) Francis Q.
Southerden and W. Robertson Strong.
But at 30th June, ’92, the auditors x-eported :
We certify that, IN OUR OPINION, the above balance-
sheet is a full and fair one, exhibiting a true statement of
the affairs of the bank AS SHOWN BY THE BOOKS.
Nothing said of vouchers, nothing of examina-
tion of securities. Which, as The Bulletin
has previously pointed out, looks ominous.
And The Worker has ferreted out a few dozen,
other little circumstances of the kind, which go
to strengthen the strong case pre-existing for a.
survey of the bank’s affairs by a committee of
(1) the Q. Auditor-General, (2) a first-class:
Southern actuary, and (3) a skilled Southern,
accountant with a reputation to lose, before the
Govt, takes any more responsibility. Yet The
Worker acknowledges the hopelessness of the
struggle :
It would appear that the Government of to-day, being
apparently strong and allowed to have much their own.
way, another tin-pot investigation will take place unless
some newspaper does its duty.
The heads of Q. Labor-party, in fact, are be-
ginning to realise the utter impotence to which
their last-election policy reduced them. Had:
they chosen to climb down from their impossible-
platform, and unite with the Opposition to
catch the Moderate vote, they might possibly
have gained a Parliamentary majority, they
would almost certainly have gained a minority
only less than the majority. As it is, the score-
of Labor members in the new Parliament are;
practically only a row of ciphers. The Govt,
majority hopelessly outnumbers them, andi
votes them down consistently. They can talk,


but it all goes for nothing when the division-
bell rings. The result is that Q. Labor-party
will paks through this Parliament as it passed
through the last, without securing one reform,
one step in advance—nay, more, without being
able to hinder backward steps, without being
able to exercise the least influence on the
policy of the Government. As legislators,
the Queensland Labor-party may be counted
out. The Govt, does as it pleases. If
the Govt, wishes to consummate any job in
connection with the Q.N. Bank, no rectitude of
purpose, no array of arguments, will avail the
Labor-party one whit against the overwhelming
Govt, majority. Whether there will be any
honest examination of the Q.N. Bank’s con-
dition depends entirely on Premier’s Nelson’s
personal honesty and self-respect. If “ the
party ” can persuade his Scotch kirk-elder’s
conscience to whitewash the sepulchre, white-
washed it will be, and the Labor-party may go
and play marbles.
Italy and the Pope.
A problem that will complicate the choice of
the Pope has already found definite statement
in the European press, and peculiarly vivid
re-statement in the radical Italian papers —and
on this point nearly all Italian papers are
radical. Will the Italian Government allow
the perpetuation of Rome as the seat of the
Papal throne? The consideration has been
urged that no other Government of Europe has
ever been called upon to receive within its
boundaries, and to be compelled to tacitly re-
cognise the pretensions of, a sovereign who—
insidiously, it is true, but nevertheless inces-
santly—makes war upon its power ; and the
Italian Government is apparently determined
to force this issue upon the contemplation of
the world. As one Italian paper puts it, “ the
Vatican is the centre of veiled insurrection,”
and it is asking altogether too much from
secular human nature to expect that the Go-
vernment which is endangered, and whose very
existence, indeed, is challenged by the insur-
rectionary force, can longer tolerate the present
conditions. As no good Catholic, according
to the pronunciamentos of the Vatican, can
be a good and patriotic citizen of Italy,
it necessarily follows that the chief concern for
the Italian Government is to finally break the
Papal power, and, therefore, the chances are
that it will only agree to the next Pope having
his home in the Vatican on condition that the
Papacy shall abandon once and for all time its
itemporal claims. In other words, the Italian
ipeople will demand the impossible, for the
assertion of those claims will never be aban-
doned by the Church, and because compliance
■with her impossible demands cannot, in the
.nature of the case, be made, then there will be
nothing for it but for the new Pontiff' to find a
twentieth-century Avignon. For the world,
ihowever, there is the supreme consideration
that the Papacy will never voluntarily abandon
Rome. Rome is not merely a figure and type
for “the Mother of all Churches.” The city is
;an integral element of the Church’s splendour
and her seeming unity. Break the tremendous
itie which connects the Church to Rome the
‘City, and you sever the historic, the ecclesias-
tical, and the sentimental bonds which bind the
infallible Church of to-day to the irrevocable
.past —to the continuity of her traditions, and
.to the ever-full reservoirs of her faith. When
the Papacy departs from Rome, the dogma of
Infallibility will have to be repealed.
The Co-Respondent that Should Have
Been.
Vic. Chief Justice Madden’s recent famous
■divorce decision seems, at time of writing, almost
certain to be overturned, like many of his other
■decisions, by the Full Court. Mr. Madden
■decreed that a husband whose wife had gone
•wrong could not get relief because he had
■allowed her to follow her profession as an
■actress, and travel with a theatrical co., and by
thus exposing her to temptation had forfeited
all claim to redress. Evidently Mr. Madden
didn’t look where he was going when he took
this amazing jump. He implied either of two
things. One was that the theatrical profession
is so immoral that every actress is expected to
go astray unless her husband has his eye upon
her all the time, therefore any man not in the
profession who marries an actress, or any man
in the profession who marries her but who can’t
get a constant engagement in the same co.,
must take it for granted that his wife
will go wrong. And as no actor can get
a constant engagement with his wife—
the Dacres tried it and the experiment
ended in ruin and poverty and a tragedy
at the memory of which the public still
shudders this means that every actress is
expected to go astray unless kept constantly
chained up. And his action in refusing to biff
the co-respondent with the strong arm of the
law means that any actor has a right to lead
her astray without suffering the usual conse-
quences ; the actress is excused because she is
led astray by the seductive heavy villain, and
the heavy villain is excused on general prin-
ciples. The other possible reading of Mr.
Madden’s judgment is that evert/ man who lets
his wife out of his sight is expe<sted to take the
consequences, and that the consequences may
be expected at any moment, and that Mr.
Madden thinks it is only the natural thing for
every woman to go wrong if the old man isn’t
alwaysathome, or if he goesout without firstlo.ck-
ing the lady up in the strong room. In one case
the whole theatrical profession, male and female,
has good cause to heave rocks at the hair-waxed
C.J., and in the other the whole female popula-
tion, and all the male population that has any
respect for the female population, has reason to
throw road-metal at him. Also, it is not quite
clear that Mr. Madden, by his own logic, isn’t
an indirect co-respondent and wrecker of happy
homes by inference. His Honor, in his pre-
judicial days, was a patron of boxing-matches
where men bashed each other’s heads for fame
and a cash consideration. Many of these men
were married. When they came—partly at
Mr. Madden’s instigation—to bash and maul
each, other they had to leave their wives at
home, which was practically the same thing as
if they had allowed their wives to go out and
leave them at home ; and they thus—partly at
Mr. Madden’s instigation —exposed these
ladies to serious temptation. When Madden,
C. assumes a lofty immoral attitude concern-
ing men who part from their wives in the course
of business, he ought to remember the large
number of men whom he has incited, more or less,
to part from their wives in pursuit of the ear-
chewing profession, and the possible conse-
quences of that separation, and assume a
humbler tone in consequence. Also, The Bulle-
tin regards the C.J. as a direct incentive to
immorality in another sense. By his own
theory, a man who lets his wife associate with
the seductive tragedian shoves her along the
downward road by exposing her to temptation.
But when a husband habitually comes home—
partly at Mr. MADDEN’sinstigation—witlihiseye
blackened, and his nose knocked endways, and
his ear six times its natural size, and his jaw on
one side, he also exposes his wife to temptation ;
the sight of that awful object—for the wreckage
and disfigurement of which Madden, C.J., paid
away his good money—is enough to make any
woman elope with anybody merely to get away
fromit. What is the difference between leading a
woman away by exposing her to the seductions
of a handsomer man than her husband, and
driving her away by making her husband uglier
than any other man? Will Chief Justice
Madden answer?
The Gospel of Greenstuff.
“1 have used no animal food for 40 years,”
boasted an ancient Sydney vegetariariatic at
the recent annual cabbage-worry of the fad,
“ and therefore I am well and hearty at 82 ! ”
This is the -post hoe with a vengeance, and even
at its best the argument cuts impartially both
ways. If A, who is vegetabilious, is entitled
to attribute to that fact his survival of B, who
wasn’t—then C, who isn't, is equally justified
in crediting to this circumstance his survival of
D, who was. Also, there is absolutely nothing
to show that, other things being equal, the
average Nebuchadnezzarite doesn’t die sooner
than the average omnivore, or get into gaol
oftener, or that he isn’t more liable to marry a
woman with one eye. Also, again—how does
this indubious ancient know that he could ever
have got through 40 years of chastened cow-
diet if it hadn’t been for the constitution built
upon his preceding 40 of unregenerate beef- and
mutton ?—or can even any life-long green-feeder
be sure that he hasn’t hung on to existence
mainly by virtue of the stamina inherited from
centuries of more or less carnivorous ancestors ?
Also, once more—what does this whole Gospel
of Garden-stuff make of the plain fact tiiat
before the flesh-consuming peoples the rice,
maize and banana-eaters have gone uniformly
to the wall ?—or of the unavoidable conclusion
that, if Nature hadn’t intended Man-animal to
subsist partly upon flesh, she would have fixed
him up—dentally, assimilatively and digestively
- —upon some such plan as the Ox-animal. When
the Vegetarian Society has successfully achieved
the chewing of its cud, its kail-yard cult will
have a leg to stand on ; meantime the butcher
has no cause to tremble !
♦
The Australasian thinks, or says it thinks,
that the Leg. Council should have control of
the public finances, and wants some reform
which will enlarge its authority in this direc-
tion
When Mr. Duffy, at the Mayor’s quarterly dinner, in-
terjected “Never, never” to Sir Frederick Sargood’s
prediction that ere long; the Leg;. Council would be given
some voice in finance, the company no doubt understood
him to be joking, as usual. The people who pay the bulk
of the taxation—certainly all the direct taxation —are not
likely to consent to any important changes in the suffrage
unless extra strength is given to the only House which
represents them. We are rapidly arriving at a state of
things in which one set of people impose taxes and vote
away the money, while another set has nothing to do but
pay such taxes. An Assembly elected by adult suffrage
would have for its constituents an immense body of voters
who pay scarcely any Customs duties and no direct taxa-
tion. The temptation to squander the revenue would,
under the new circumstances, be irresistible.
This is interesting, as showing what the House
of 48 Rich Landlords means to do with Turner’s
One-Adult-One-Vote Bill when it comes along.
The property-owners of Victoria have now' a
larger say in the Assembly than the non-pro-
pertied classes by virtue of their plural vote.
Also, they have entire control of the Leg.
Council, so that the Fat Man is fully repre-
sented in two Houses and the Lean Man has a
small voice in only one. The statement that
the Council is the only House which represents
Fat is a fine piece of lying; the Council is the
only House which represents Fat alone, but
that is quite a different thing, and why the Fat
Man should have a House all to himself while
the Lean Man hasn’t passes comprehension.
The Australasian’s definition of wdiat the
present Upper House wants is a solid reason
why the Sargood crowff which goes up for re-
election next month should be ejected bodily.
If Victoria misses the opportunity to throw
that mob out on its ear, then it fully deserves
whatever may happen to it. What will happen
so far as the Adult Suffrage scheme is concerned
seems tolerably evident. The price proposed
to be charged for that measure is the surrender
to the Council of an equal share in the control
of the finances, and even adult suffrage would
be six times too dear at such a figure. It would
only mean that every citizen would have an
equal vote in the election of the Assembly ;
but, as a contra, the Assembly would be so
much shorn of its authority that it would be
hardly worth anybody’s while to have any vote
there at all. The Vic. Fat Man has more than
an equal voice on financial matters now by
reason of his plural vote in Assembly elections,
and his demand for another equal voice all to
himself is a very large order.
If one-half the allegations made up to date re
the management of the Melbourne post, tele-
graph, and telephone office are true, that
department should be about the most wonderful
sink of corruption on this continent. ' So far it
would seem to have existed mainly for the pur-
pose of supplying jobs to one favored contractor
at extraordinary prices. One of the charges
alleged against him is £4 14s. for repairing a
coal barrow, the value of the work being esti-
mated at 17s. 6d. He is also accused of receiv-
ing £ll Bs. for stores worth £1 18s. ; and for
13 jobs, of an estimated value of £32, he is
alleged to have sent in a bill for £lO3 and been
paid quite cheerfully and without any demur.
It is further averred that some of the goods
never came to hand at all, and that some of
them were wholly useless ; but as a book, which
was supposed to throw a lot of light on the
matter, has disappeared, and no one knows
where it is, and the most wild and infuriated
search can’t bring it to light, the inquiry is at
present going on three legs and making less
progress than it might do. The board, which
was long busy hunting up evidence about fes-
tive ladies who called in to see officers of the
department and did casual high-kicks and other
exercise, has now got into dead earnest, and
seems likely to break something.
The Peacock Factories Act (Vic.) does not
specifically provide for a weekly closing of
shops for half-a-day—but indirectly that will
be one of its general effects, beginning in Oct.
next. Shopkeepers halt between two opinions.
Wednesday? Saturday? And all the while
employees pray that the choice may fall on
Saturday, so that “ the evening and the morn-
ing ” may be the holiday. The larger city shops
close on Saturday afternoon already—and this
privilege cannot be taken from them even by a
majority. Many suburbs now celebrate a
Wednesday half-holiday—reserving Saturday
till 10 p.m. for the big business of the week.
To have the “universal Saturday ” would be a
great boon to thousands now kept working
while all the world enjoys itself; but, of course,
Wednesday, if generally recognised, would
become a sports day, and would make a
pleasant break in the week’s work. One of the
surprises of the situation has been to find so
many shopkeepers willing to discuss closing on
Saturday, usually worth three other days for
business, when there is a prospect that other
shops would do the same, and that “ wages
day ” would be shifted back to Friday or
Thursday.
Nothing but male loyalty and public pressure
will keep women from playing havoc with cur-
rent male wages-rates in the new branches of
industry to which Australian Governments and
other employers have recently admitted them.
Some of the late Postal appointments of women
are said to be accompanied by a scale of pay
pointing to decline. Men, however strongly
opposed to the employment of women, must
now, seeing woman has forced admittance,
stand by her in demanding payment at man’s
rates, or men’s and women’s wages will both go
down (as in Maoriland, where two compositors,
husband and wife, work for wages which in the
aggregate do not amount to more than a man’s
pay according to the Australian standard). If
men don’t support women in claiming men’s
wages, employers, State and private, will re-
duce men to women’s rates. In Lancashire
(Eng.) all weavers are paid alike. Men and
women work side by side, and the pay-sheet
takes no stock of sex. There the men stood by
the women, and wages now scale on the male
level. In the textile industries of Yorkshire,
male workers stood aside and the male wages
are every month sinking nearer to the female
level. When work is- equal, sex can’t count as
an extra. The water-level is what the em-
ployer can get the work at.
Dear Bulletin, —How is the Argus weakness
for giving local militia potentates their full
military titles on all occasions to be reconciled
with the strenuous efforts of the conservative
print to be caustic at the expense of the Ameri-
can colonel, captain, general, judge, etc. ?
What is true and impressive dignity in the
Britisher is howlingly absurd in the American
citizen. So dignity, like morality, has its geo-
graphical limitations, and, as with true mora-
lity, so with unquestionable dignity, it is made
only in Britain and her dependencies, and not
for exportation. No wonder the Vic. Tory
press bolsters the militia ; it is a veritable hot-
house for the forcing of young Tories. The
militiaman who looks for advancement becomes
a blatant Imperialist, and naturally an ossified
Tory ; all his ideals are at ’Ome, and his
ambitions, and usefulness, and beauty are only
appreciated to the utmost by the conservative
papers that are always shrieking for more
defences, and picturing the poor private Aus-
tralian citizen crouching terrified behind a noble
wall of soldiers who defy his foes for him at so
much a month. The foes are purely imaginary,
and nothing more is needed. “ Defiance, not
defence,” should be the motto of the Victorian
militia. —S.
“ All religions that I fell in with in Ireland seemed to
me too irreligious ; really, in sad truth, doing mischief to
the people in place of good.”— Thomas Carlyle. “ I can-
not help thinking that religion is the root of Irish misery.”

Wasthe late Monarch William aourse or ablessing?
It isn’t a question which troubles us much ;
For this is the point we consider distressing—
The bone of your Irish contention was Dutch.
Disputes on the topic of Saxon oppression
Spring up from the sod of your Emerald Isle,
But the passions provoked by an Orange procession
Are simply and truly religiously vile ;
So, rush into action, supporters of faction,
Who love to distraction
A pious belief:
Go, scatter and shatter the brothers you
batter,
And finish tne matter
By coming to grief.
“ Equality under the law ” is the coming, and
now near, cry of the Australian So-
licitor Kong Sing very properly told Stipendiary
Deloiiery, in a Sydney Court some few days
ago, that he did not see why Chinamen were
raided and hauled to justice and heavily fined
for playing fan-tan or pak-a-pu, while Euro-
peans who gamble in pubs, and clubs and pri-
vate houses remain unmolested. Chinamen in
North Queensland, remembering the rights
possessed by the squatters of old, petition the
Government to shift the straggling aborigines
from their neighborhood, or to, in effeet, allow
them to use the squatter-plan of “dispersal. In
other parts the same appreciation of the posi-
tion and the same demand for the advantages
and privileges of the white man are taking
substance and shape:—and where is the human
reason that can rebut the cry ?
Q. Chief-Justice Griffith has presented to
Parliament some “ Notes on Australian Federa-
tion,” in which he says, with appalling circum-
locution,, that on the colored-labor question at
the present time a federal authority couldn t
possibly know where it are. Griffith’s extra-
ordinary mind pulls so many different ways
that it will never be made up in this world, and
doubtfully in the next. No other Australian —
not even’ Parkes —has left such a serpentine
political track. At various times, Griffith
has opposed Chinese immigration ; has opposed
coolie ditto ; has indirectly supported Chinese
until his political opponents nicknamed him Ah
Sam ; has declared kanaka laborers to be
worse oppressed than the victims read of in
“ the blackest annals of the slave-trade has
encouraged and legalised kanakas ; and has de-
spatched an emissary at public expense to
Europe to arrange for the importation of “ mean
whites.” Griffith, while not pretending to be
particularly pious, has had the political support
of the Churches (probably because his pa was a
Congregational parson) ; he has had the support
of the teetotallers, while consistently drinking
whisky ; has been the leader of the “ great Q.
Liberal-party ” without being a Liberal; has
had the adoration of the Labor-party—and its
detestation; was leader of a Bar that profes-
sionally and socially “ cut ” barristers who be-
came “ legal practitioners ” (“ amalgams ”), yet
was the first Q. Premier to make a “solicitor-
only ” (Mein) a Supreme Court Judge. Was
there ever such a political polyhedron ?
Victorian law on the subject of treasure-
trove seems a trifle mixed. The other day
a Melbourne man was acquitted at the Supreme
Court on the charge of larceny of and receiving
a watch and chain which his little daughter
had found and his wife had pawned. The
Crown said, by its prosecutor, Walsh, Q.C.,
that “if a person found an article he was ex-
pected to make reasonable effort to discover the
owner.” The Crown said by its defender —
well, the Crown didn’t have a defender, so his
view is unobtainable—and Judge Holroyd
summed up that “ if the accused at the time he
received the watch had no intention of appro-
priating it, he was not guilty of larceny.”
But not very long ago Madden, C.J., said that
any person finding an article in the street was
entitled to keep it; and more recently Judge
Williams declared the exact opposite, and said
that such person was not entitled to keep it,
even though no claim were made for it. What
he was to do with such article the Judge
omitted to say. Perhwps he didn’t know. In
the face of all this, how does the State itself
stand ? If an article be left in a railroad car-
riage it is passed on to the lost-property depart-
ment. The State contents itself with advertis-
ing a monthly or quarterly list of its findings in
the Govt. Gazette ; and should the owmer
(possibly under the impression that it was lost
elsewhere) advertise for its return, the State
takes no notice whatever. Yet, at the end of
six or twelve months the State sells all these
lost articles by auction and collars the proceeds,
thereby showing its intention of appropriating
the lost article or the value thereof. Things
are mixed.
A Public Health Bill which Maoriland Parlia-
ment is now struggling with provides, among
other things, that every ship-master arriving in
M.L. must make a declaration that none of his
passengers are consumptive, and failing this he
will be fined £5O ; if he lands any consumptive
passenger he will be fined £lO and the consump-
tive will be fined a similar amount; if he allow's
a consumptive to occupy the same cabin as
another passenger he will be fined <£so ; and if
a person proves, within three months of his
arrival in M.L., to be consumptive, he shall be
deemed to have been consumptive on arrival,
and the captain who brought him shall be held
responsible. This last clause will make matters
tolerably interesting for the captain, who is
required to diagnose consumption three months
before it becomes generally visible. A glance
at the death-statistics, however, seem to cast
some doubt on the logic of the whole business.
In 1894 there were 576 deaths from consump-
tion in Maoriland, and 287 of the patients were
born in the province, while there were only 41
out of the 576 who had lived in it for less than
five years. From this it would seem that M.L.
mostly grows its own consumptive, and that the
tuberculous cow -and pig in the province are in
a great deal more need of inspection than the
tuberculous man who arrives from outside.
The chief reason why political debates on Pro-
tectionism versus Freetrade, or so-called public
orationson either of these questions, are generally
unprofitable and beside the mark, and useless
as demonstrations of any idea or ideal, is that
each advocate merely “ begs the question” and
fabricates his premises. The Protectionist
w'ould-be light is too busily engaged in slang-
wlianging the iniquities of the importing
monopolist to build up any logical edifice in
support of his cause ; and the Freetrade apostle
is too recklessly eager to demolish the manu-
facturing monopolist to pay any attention
to any other aspect of his case than “ the curse
of cheapness. Wanted : A real live debate,
in which it shall be taken for granted at the
outset that both importers and manufacturers
will, whenever they get the chance, grab all
they can, fine or tax the working-man all they
can, fatten all they can, and give as little in
return as they can—after the ordinary fashion
of ordinary human nature. In short: A debate
on Protectionism with human greed as its
basis v. Freetrade with human greed as its
basis. After which, the application of the
issue to the particular people or country inter-
ested should supply the solution of the vexed
enigma. There is no absolutism of any fiscal
theory. There is no fixed gospel. To a com-
The Wesleyan chant is a damnable horror,
The bell of the Baptist rings hell in the ear;
A Catholic soul is unhappy—begorrah !
As long as a “ father ” can hold it in fear ;
The smug English-Churchman seeks grace in pre-
tences ;
Poor plutocrat atheists worship the Queen;
But the stupidest bigots insulting our senses
Are rival adherents of Orange and Green.
Then clutch a shillaley, Dunn, Dawson, and
Daly,
And bring it down gaily
On somebody’s head ;
Hit hard and hit many, no mercy to any—
Fight, cats of Kilkenny,
Until ye drop dead.

munity marooned on a barren rock in mid-
ocean, protectionism would be a hideous
handicap. To a people living in an island-
continent, fertile and resourceful, but threat-
ened by greedy foreign naval powers, Freetrade
might mean extinction or subjugation or
starvation. The diet or physic of a babe
would be innutrient and weakening to an
adult; the diet or physic of an adult would
eufever a babe. Also, a babe must crawl, or
be aided to walk, before it can walk of its own
volition and without bandying its legs. Why
not apply the simplest rules of common-sense
to fiscal surroundings, instead of talking rhodo-
niontade about millennial theories ? Given the
straight-out issue : Fat Man v. Lean Man, or
Haves v. Have-nots, which fiscal theory is more
profitably applicable to the majority (i.e., the
Have-nots) in Australia ?

The combination bill, “ Cavalleria llusti-
cana ” and “ David Garrick,” which filled in three
nights at Sydney Lyceum, after Tosca had finally
bumped herself to death over the Roman battle-
ments, did something to improve the reputation
of the Potter-Bellew combination. In “Caval-
leria,” Mrs. Potter was the same exaggerated,
wild-eyed, wildly-painted, posturing creature as
reported last week, but in the more peaceful
character of Violet Gresham she gave herself a
fair chance with very pleasing results. Her great
beauty—which was wholly lost in the beplastered
countenances of Tosca and Santuzza—asserted it-
self, and her costumes were a dazzle of glorious
millinery. She put comparatively little force into
the part ; when she ordered the inebriated Gar-
rick out of the house it was done with the even,
placid voice of one who asks for change of a half-
penny, and she fled from her hard parent in an
emotionless monotone which was wholly unequal
to the situation. But in all the beauty scenes of the
play Mrs. Potter was a great and undeniable suc-
cess. . Bellew’s Garrick was effective at every point,
but in “Cavalleria,” Scot Inglis, as Alfio, the
teamster, overshadowed everybody else, and made
the one unquestionable success of the little tragedy.
There was more picturesqueness and more life and
energy and realism about him than in all the rest
of the show, and when he polished-off Bellew,
after getting his ear considerably bitten, and
Bellew had died a rather unreal kind of death, he
was the only person that the audience cared to re-
member to any great extent.
* * * »
The P. B. co., at time of writing, is doing
a spell of “ As You Like It ” to excellent business,
and Mrs. Potter is about the prettiest and best-
dressed Rjsalind that Sydney has yet seen. There
is a tendency to exaggeration about her in places,
and she is somewhat unreal in other places, and in
some more places she almost forgets to be artificial
and is in danger for a moment of being a really
charming and clever heroine, and the general
impression is—at least, it is just going to be, when
the actress degenerates into her old artificialism,
and then the audience really doesn’t know what its
impression was, or was going to be. Still, Mrs.
Potter’s beauty and her occasional touches of
brilliance, or something that might be brilliance if
it didn’t depart so suddenly that the audience
hasn’t time to be quite sure what it might have
been if it had stayed long enough to be anything
in particular, carry her through, and the general
effect is good. The co. is an unusually strong one ;
there is not a weak spot in the performance,
barring the bewildering Potter, concerning whom
the public hasn’t begun to be. certain whether she
is a weak spot or not. Bellew’s Orlando is a
strong, consistent performance. Scot Inglis is
perhaps the best Jacques who has pervaded the
Australian stage, and Miss Polly Emery the best
Audrey, and the veteran Cathcart fills the part of
the ancient Adam for all that patriarch is worth.
The show is mounted in a large, rich, expensive
fashion, especially for a six-night performance,
and the next thing that happens is “ Camille,” on
Saturday, for three nights only, after which
“ School for Scandal” fills a similar period.
* * * *
The “ King of Crime ” pursues his course
of battle, murder, and sudden death at Her
Majesty’s until Friday, and on Saturday he will
give place to “True as Steel.” There is not so
much unexpected funeral in this piece as in the
present production, but it is remembered in
Sydney as a healthy and solid drama with a moral
as large as an elephant, and a reasonable amount
of corpse. Marschner, trick cyclist, has been
temporarily on the programme at H.M.’s, and
some of his doings are calculated to make even the
stolid Plugger Martin green with envy.
* * * *
Maggie Moore abandons the character of
the mesmerised maiden with no stockings on for
the last three nights (Friday, Saturday, and Mon-
day) of her season at Sydney Royal, and farewells
in good old “Struck Oil” and the “Chinese
Question.” Friday is Miss Moore’s benefit, and,
as Premier Reid and the rest of the God-fearing
Ministry are to be present and the surplus will be
on view in the vestibule, it promises to be a very
large event indeed.
** * *
Harry Rickards has done nothing more
than usually extraordinary at Sydney Tivoli this
week, Crackles and the Frantz Family and the
mysterious Provo being still in possession. La
Bell Maie has returned to walk her airy wire, and
some other people are expected, and sundry more
people are going away shortly. The Ovide Musin
Concert Co., under Lohr’s management, is due at
the Centenary Hall on Saturday night, and the
return of Bland Holt from a place called Brisbane,
which is beside a creek somewhere, is beginning
to be remotely expected.
** * *
A ghostly exhibition, said to be inspired
by Rontgen’s discovery, is going just now in King-
street, Sydney. A man, fully dressed, is shown
standing in a coffin. The lights are lowered and
then raised again, and the occupant of the coffin
is a skeleton. In response to requests from the
audience the bony fragment waves his arm and
gnashes his forbidding jaw. Voice from the
audience asks him to “ Have a beer,” but this is
obviously absurd as he has no place to put it, and
the memento treats the suggestion with silent
contempt. Then the lights flicker down again for
a second or two, and the bony one is gone and the
man is back again, and the person who made the
rash offer of beer goes surreptitiously away.
** # *
“ The Nominee,” in which Nat Goodwin
finishes his Melbourne season to-night (Thursday),
is one more story of a comic married man going
forth upon the razzle-dazzle and suffering subse-
quent tribulation at the hands of his mother-in-
law. Years ago, Harry St. Maur introduced
“ The Candidate ” to Australia, with some suc-
cess. “ The Nominee ” is a bright American
variation of “ The Candidate,” and a much less
impossible joke; Nat Goodwin is a better
comedian than St. Maur, and altogether the sh«w
under notice calls for a general expression of re-
gret that it didn’t come along a fortnight earlier
to prevent other things from happening mean-
while. There is a political backbone to the
narrative. The razzling sinner gets returned
to Congress on the wrong ticket unbeknown
to himself, for whilst he should have been preach-
ing the Jacksonian doctrine of Freetrade to a
savage tribe of Protectionists in a remote elector-
ate he was otherwise engaged with a gaudy Annie
at New York. And when Annie tracks him to
his domestic circle it appears that she really came
to capture somebody else, four male members of
the cast having given their hearts to this dissolute
female at one time or other. The feeblest of the
four victims ends the disturbance by volunteering
to marry Annie, to whom a wedding, more or less,
will make very little difference.
* * » *
Nat Goodwin is a fine, broad, polished
joke in the name part of this amusing piece,
whilst the company—barring only the feeble
youth aforesaid —supports him well enough. The
Misses Elliott—Gertrude and Maxine —made their
first appearance oil Saturday night, and proved to
be valuable additions. Miss Gertrude is a neat
little actress : Miss Marine walks majestically
through the character of the razzler’s doting wife,
and excites great astonishment at his conduct in
leaving her for fourteen days. Most husbands
would think it advisable to be tied to her apron-
string henceforth and forever.
“ Romeo’s First Love,” preceding “ The
Nominee,” might easily have been an unwarrant-
able insult to Divine William, but the author (one
A. E. Lancaster) deserves credit for an earnest
little effort to depict an incident in Romeo’s career
prior to his meeting with Juliet. The damsel in
this case is uninteresting, and some of the Shake-
spearian characters chant their lines on the panto-
mime-fairy principle, nevertheless the ambitious
trifle, elegantly staged, gives Miss Blanche Walsh
a chance to create a graceful young Romeo. Her
share of the performance was a decided success on
Saturday night, and this journal takes the oppor-
tunity to heave a sigh over the rumor of Miss
Walsh’s immediate return to the land of her birth.
* * * *
“ Romany Rye, ’ at Melb. Royal, promises
to restore some of the lost business to that vener-
able establishment. The public that stayed away
from “Cheer, Boys, Cheer ” for unknown reasons
is disposed to make amends by rolling-up to the
older melodrama, and the overthrow of the mur-
derous individual who stole George Rignold’s
birthright, or purchased the papers belonging to
his girl, is received with much acclamation.
“Romany Rye ” comes of a tough race of melo-
dramas. During ten years’ absence from Mel-
bourne it has lost none of its early vigor. The
chief villain curses his gipsy relative as heartily
as before, the inebriate bird - fancier is still
on the original burst, and the Mother Shipton
who sits brooding over her evil past in a damp
cellar seems rather younger than the creaking hag
of long ago. Likewise, the shipwreck has kept
pace with modern improvements. “Romany
Rye depends a good deal upon its famous marine
disaster, and the present rendering of the foain-
fleeked waves is all that could be desired, if not
more so. George Rignold, Plimmer, Sweeney,
Miss Watts Phillips, Walter Raynham, Miss
Williamson, and Miss Emily Hughes (as Gertie
Heckett) have most to do with the plot. Generally
speaking, they do it rather better than it deserves,
but not so well as Brunton did the scenery.
“ Romany Rye ” seems likely to run another week,
although “ Called Back ”is ready and anxious to
take the floor.

Revd. Charles Clark will breathe his last
lecture at Melb. Athenaeum Hall on, or about,
Saturday (29th), and.Musin will give a farewell
matinee at the same spot this afternoon (Thurs-
day) previous to leaving for Sydney.
* * *■ *
On Saturday “ A Trip to Chinatown ” will
be produced at Melb. Princess’s, an announce-
ment which is quite superfluous under the cir-
cumstances. The city has been talking of the
American burlesque for some time, and everybody
knows that the hour of his arrival is at hand. On
Friday the Princess’s closes for preparations.
** * *
A very ’igh-life performance of “ The
Parvenu ” is to come off at Cliveden, the Mel-
bourne residence of baronet Clarke, on Sept. 1, in
aid of the local Fever Hospital. Pretty Miss
Mary Clarke is cast for leading lady’s part, and
her brother Frank will impersonate the pampered
flunkey in attendance. Lord Shaftesbury, Lieut.
Col. Bingham, Mrs. Alfred Cornish (related to
colonial royalty), also a Mr. Vivian, whose name
sounds promisingly proud and haughty, will be
principal male conspirators in this deserving out-
rage, and the price of tickets for the good cause is
fixed at 7s. 6d. Three half-crowns is a reasonable
figure for an entertainment of such social magni-
tude, therefore Lady Clarke exhorts patrons of
the charity drama to book their seats early. Chil-
dren in arms and other disreputable characters
will not be admitted.
** * *
Hearing Musin and Scharf play the
Kreutzer Sonata to a moderate audience at Melb.
Athenaeum, one felt a hearty contempt for the
local “musical world” whish had swarmed into
the Town Hall, a while back, to enthuse over
the vastly inferior performance of Kruse and De
Beaupuis. Verily the Kruse boom was the greatest
of R. S. Smythe’s achievements in gammoning
the public.

There is medical authority for suggesting
that the Nerveless Man on tour may possibly bean
addition to the roll of lepers. Dr. Sam. Williams,
of Melbourne, states that the N.M. case reads
exactly like one of “anaesthetic leprosy” (little
known to the faculty in Australia), which doesn’t
show itself on the skin. Dr. Williams has sampled
this interesting disease in ’Murka, or somewhere,
and stuck pins into it without giving the patient
any discomfort.

The Wild- Cat Column.
Premier Reid last Thursday laid on N.S.W.
Assembly table a document which badly wrecked his
financial reputation, and said in a tone of triumph that
he thereby fully vindicated himself from all the charges
brought against him. The document in question was a
report from the Auditor-General. It stated that the
a ,‘ e f9 e c d “ Ulbb ?, defi< ; i , t ’” U P t 0 the e,ld of was not
£1,465,000 as alleged by Premier Reid, but only £851,000
The Reid deficit for the half-year, January to June,’9s'
was set down at £149,000—0r at the rate of £298 000 a
y ea J> . , T . he to f al deficit- was, therefore, £1,000,000, and as
G. Reid issued £1,174,000 of Treasury bills to cover it he
apparently borrowed £174,000 under pretence of coverinsr
a shortage that didn’t exist. Also, he is convicted
roan Auditor-General of accusing his predecessor
of £600,000 more deficit than really existed, which
is a painful situation and a bad reflection on
iremier Reids character. Further, the Auditor-General
has transferred £411,000 of the alleged revenue for the
half-year ended June, ’95, hack to previous years, pre-
sumably on the ground that G.H.R. was trying to take
credit for money which belonged to his predecessors, and
thereby make his own accounts look £411,000 better and
his predecessors the same amount worse, than thev
w f r ®-. Again, the Auditor-General knocks the
it rf 0n the head to a £ reat extentl by showing
that half of it was accumulated before Bibbs took office
to say nothing of the fact that a large amount of the total
shortage was incurred after he left office. And when he
thls d° eu «i e nt on the table, and thus convicted
himself on the best authority of manipulating the
accounts m various ways to put his predecessor in the
worst possible light, Premier Reid said that he “ deeply
regretted the outrageous attacks upon him had compelled
cheers” S6ek thlB vllldlcation >” and there were “loud
The wildest humor of the situation, however
consisted of a report on the financial situation from three
bank managers. Premier Reid stated that he had asked
Dibbs of the Commercial Banking Co. of Svdnev Stanton
of the City Bank, and French of the 8.N.5.W., to examine
hp a n?° o Un v? ai L- d See that , tl \ e surplus was genuine. And
the three bankers reported : “ With regard to the con
mg piuag raph of your letter, asking us to look at the
cash balances oil thfe 30th June, 1896, and to state whether
there was or was not a surplus of revenue in 1895-6 over
expenditure, chargeable by law to the year 1895-6, and if
so, how much? we feel we are unable, with the informal
tion at our command, to give an answer.” The Treasurer
who proudly lays on the table a report from a committee
of his own selection saying that it won’t guarantee the
correctness of his figures, and declares that his position
is now fully vindicated, is a most wonderful perso?

The Australasian Securities Investment Corpo-
ration, whose prospectus appears in another column, is a
quaint idea in the way of subdivision of labor. The
Association proposes to raise a capital of £250,000, though
there is power to increase it up to £2,500,000. This will
be invested in the shares or debentures or other securities
of joint-stock companies, not more than 10 per cent, of
the capital at the utmost being* fixed in any one security
though it is intended to keep the limit much lower than
even this, the idea is that the Association, being run by
cute business-men and its risks distributed over a large
area and carefully watched, will always more than balance
any losses through the depreciation of one security by the
rise of another, whereas the individual investor may have
his all m one investment and see it go hopelessly broke
The idea is sound enough and quite feasible, and the pro-
posed Association is under excellent management \ still
there is something grotesque about it. Nowadays men
form companies to do almost everything. Next they begin
to form companies for the express purpose of holding
shares in those companies. And, if the securities invest-
ment corporations become numerous, someone may yet
strike the bright idea of forming a co. for the express
purpose of holding shares in them. And as every co. in-
volves some kind of a manager and office and board of
directors, and as the possibilities in the way of forming
co’s to hold shares in other co’s are practically unlimited,
it follows—well, it is difficult to say what does not follow.
* * * *
That struggling institution, the Australian De-
posit and Mortgage Bank, has closed the half-year with a
profit of £69—equal to about fourpence per cent, per
annum on capital. Even this is a great improvement on
the previous three half-years, which showed losses of
£2616, £7566, and £5631 respectively. The recent reduc-
tion in interest, however, saves about ' 9000 for the half-
year, therefore the dilapidated institution ought to have
been £9OOO better than it was for the half-year ended
June, ’95, and as it is only £7635 better it would seem
that it is really— apart from the saving in interest—£l36s
worse. Still, in one respect it shows an improvement:
deposits have been reduced by t'72,000, and now stand at
only £594,000. This is almost Ihe only' bright spot in the
report. Interest on loans and investments (£10,944) is
£776 less than last half and is less than £1 14s. per cent,
per annum on the investments, and if the co.’s money is
lent out at an average rate of only 5 per cent, this means
that fully £BOO,OOO of the alleged assets are unremunera-
tive, or dead, or more or less lost, or comatose, or some-
thing. Freehold property (£66,000) yields £367 (not
much over 1 per cent.), which is too humble to be worth
mentioning. The A. D. and M. Bank may have got round
the corner; it is something to have made any kind of a
profit by any process whatever, and the fact that its pro-
perties have begun to be saleable once more is encourag-
ing ; but it has a long, dusty road still before it.
* * » »
The Land Mortgage Bank of Victoria, another
casual survivor of the boom, announces that the net loss
is £9696, compared with £BS47 and £6616 in the two pre-
vious six-monthly periods. The Land Mortgage has only
£250,000 of paid-up capital, and owes £900,000 on deben-
tures, so it is woefully top-heavy. The debentures bear
V P er cent, interest, and a callous gang of English inves-
tors have so far refused to make a reduction, but
further negotiations are in progress. A reduction of
interest to 2 per cent, would just save the concern, if
things don’t get any worse, but, otherwise, its prospects
look about hopeless. A call of £1 per share (£250,000)
has been made, but it would require a call of nearly a
million to pay off the ruinous debenture-holders and put
the concern on its feet, and as the proceeds of the call up to
30th June were only £5lBl, the progress so far is hardly
worth mentioning. Seeing that the L.M. Bank is trading
almost entirely on borrowed money, and the said money
costs twice as much as it earns after paying working ex-
penses, and it is hardly possible to get a large enough re-
duction to make ends meet, and things are apparently
getting worse rather than better, so that even a reduction
to 2 per cent, might only postpone the trouble, and con-
sidering that the shareholders’ little capital is probably
more than all gone in depreciation already, and even on
paper the assets are £40,000 less than the liabilities to
shareholders and the public, and no progress worth
speaking of seems to be made with the realisation of the
assets, it looks as if the best course for the Land Mort-
gage Bank would be to give up the ghost—what ghost
there is.
* * * *
The Standard Bank (Melb.), still another weary
fragment of the boom, announces that it has lost £7063
for the half-year, as against £1513 and £4908 lost for the
two previous half-years. Also, £224,107 has been written
off for bad debts, and a depressing appendix states that
further losses will have to be provided for. The de-
posits have been reduced by £42,000, but they still
amount to £682,000, which is a stupendous load to
shift. Calls are £66,000 in arrear, and seem very
hard to collect. Even on book - values the assets
are now £240,000 less than the total liabilities, which
means that nearly half the capital has disappeared over
the horizon. The gross takings are less than 2) per cent,
per annum on the written-down value of the securities.
The Standard some time ago struck an arrangement with
its depositors, whereby they agreed to take 2J4 per cent,
interest in cash and the remaining 2 per cent, in new
deposits due 1903, but as the institution is not earning,
over and above expenses, even the 2| immediately pay-
able, it is evident that, unless things improve, the bottom
must fall out of it sooner or later.
* * *
The Commercial Bank of Tasmania shows a
profit for the half-year of £4024, as compared with £3261
for the last half and £4410 the one before. A 5 per cent,
dividend and income-tax absorb £3766, so there is only
£258 to carry forward. The earnings are equal to rather
less than 3 per cent, on the shareholders’ funds, so things
are none too gorgeous with the old Commercial.
* * * *
United States banking law defines a bad debt as
one the interest on which is more than six months in
arrear and which is not covered by full security and the
security in process of realisation. Any debts with interest
over six months in arrear and which are unsecured, or
where the security is not being realised, are not allowed
to be reckoned as assets, and if there are not sufficient
other assets to cover liabilities a Govt, official shuts up
the concern. The U.S. finds that State control is quite
possible, though the Australian Fat Man professes to re
gard it as an anarchical idea which has never been tried—
a mere impossible, impracticable vision of wild-eyed men
with long hair and bombs in their hands. The system
was adopted in the States by hard, conservative men as a
mere matter of business, and the whirling dynamiter is
attached to it here in a perfectly irrelevant fashion to
scare off the public, though he has no more to do with it
than a massacre has with a P/N at three months.

An irreplaceable store of medical instinct
and experience goes to the grave with Dr. Thomas
Chambers, who died at Sydney of pneumonia on
Sunday last, aged 07. Dr. Chambers was probably
Australasia’s leading gynecologist, and was, before
he came to Australia for his health, a dozen years
ago, one of London’s best-known “ woman-
doctors.” To the last, he was an ardent student.
He shone equally in diagnosis and in operative
surgery, and had the complete confidence alike of
the medical profession and of hosts of patients.

M Cracken’s Brewery (Melb.) is appealing to its
debenture-holders (mostly English) to reduce interest from
4£ to 3 per cent., and extend the date of repayments
from 1908 to 1916. The institution is loaded down with
£500,000 of debentures, so the reduction would save it
£7500 a-year. As the loss last year was £22,923, while for
1894 it was £9983, and for 1893 there was a loss of £4636,
it is difficult to see how a mere saving of £7500 a-year can
do much to keep the institution on its legs. The co. has
a paid-up capital of £500,000, and, as already mentioned,
owes £500,000 on debentures. Also, it has a growing
overdraft; its assets consist mostly of £900,000 worth of
hotels and other properties at cost, and the said assets are
even then admittedly £53,000 less than the liabilities
to shareholders and creditors. And what is the present
value of £900,000 worth of hotels, &c. ? Would they fetch
anything like enough to cover the debenture-holders
alone?

Victoria Coffee Palace Co. (Melb.) reports a

a steady increase in business, a gradual diminution in the
overdraft, a reduced rent, and a lifting of the depression,
dividends begin to appear possible once more.

One great point to be noted in tbe Police-court
hearing of the City of Melbourne Bank case was the treat-
ment of an all-important witness, Edmund Rouse, by
both the Crown and the defence. Mr. Rouse’s examina-
tion and cross-examination was expected to last for many
days. He is the ex-manager of the London branch, who,
in'September, 1892, telegraphed to Melbourne enquiring
whether the bank was involved in B. J. Fink’s insolvency
and to what extent. The reply was a ghastly tarradiddle,
understating the amount of Fink’s liability and. overstat-
ing that the bank was fully covered. Rouse’s testimony
to this vital fact in the Crown case was elicited in the
most unobtrusive manner possible. It wasn’t enlarged
upon, or held up to public notice by the examining coun-
sel, and within the short space of twenty minutes the
gentleman from London was bustled out of the witness-
box. There was no cross-examination whatever. Alfred
Deakin managed to interject an assertion that Rouse was
“trying to prejudice the case,” but having fired his blank
cartridge, the mock-indignant barrister took care not to
attempt to prove where the alleged “ prejudice ” came in.
Chief witness Rouse had stated a damning truth against
the City of Melbourne Bank management, and seemingly
the general policy of the enquiry was to give a gentle
cough and look as though nothing unpleasant had
occurred.
* * * *
The City of Melbourne Bank crowd had one
anxious moment when Rouse was giving evidence
as to certain figures. Barrister Deakin interrupted
Rouse, who promptly flared up and threatened
mischief—“ Don’t put words into my mouth. Are
you giving evidence here or am I? Will you hold
your tongue until I ask you a question and don’t
make assertions concerning what you know nothing
about. Don't interrupt me or I will .” The witness
stopped short, and presently apologised for having lost
his temper. But the threat was truly awful whilst it
lasted.
* * * *
The Bulletin would like to read Edmund
Rouse’s private report on the C. of M. Bank prosecution,
formed from his own brief experience in the witness-box.
It would be as interesting as Kaye’s letters ’Ome re the
Mercantile Bank trial.

commissions. They soon break through the rule when
good co’s decline to pay the fees—as in the case of
Charters Towers mines. Most of the money lost in share-

Melbourne Full Court, having granted uncon-
ditional certificates to Matthew Davies, J. B. Davies, and
other insolvent boomsters, was bound to upset Judge
Molesworth’s ruling in the case of C. B. Fisher, the good
old squatting identity who failed for a million and a-half.
Judge Molesvvorth found that the insolvent’s schedule
was a record of reckless speculations, and in a plain-
English acceptation of the term “ reckless ” this finding
was undoubtedly correct. The Full Court got over the
difficulty by stating that Mr. Fisher’s schedule revealed
nothing more than “ a prudent and generous man might
have done.” It was not the business of any captious logi-
cian in a horse-hair wig to denounce the Full Court’s law.
C. B. Fisher’s certif. had no bitter opponents, and it came
in the natural course of things Melbournian. But he
might at least have been spared the charge of prudence
in conjunction with due credit for generosity. Better to
have held him up to public respect as an insolvent whose
recklessness was free from the popular taint of dishonesty.

N.S.W. “Lands” Carruthers : “Out of over
200,000 selections taken up under the Act of ’6l, only

was used for some purpose other than the benefit of the
community.” What? Only 90 per cent, of dumtnydom ?
And the wholesale thieves of yesterday are the Js.P. who

Sydney Mint received in ’95 less N.S.W. gold
than in ’94 to the extent of 20,6710 z. —a similar shortage
of Q. gold amounting to 108,5050 z. —which Deputy
Master Macdonald Cameron explains in his report to
London as arising from stoppage of mining operations
through want of water. The official estimates, however,
show that the Q. yield did not drop to nearly the extent
suggested by Mr. Cameron, and that the N.S.W. yield
actually showed an increase of 35,0000 z. The fact appears
to be that gold is diverted from the Sydney Mint by the
very high coinage charges that for some reason are con-
stantly maintained there. Sydney charges are for certain
parcels three times heavier than 'Melbourne charges.
Much N.S.W. gold is annually exported unminted, but
practically every ounce of Vic. gold gets coined.

Pambula : “ Two Melb. gentlemen representing
considerable capital have gone out to Jingera to inspect

that some of the properties that are now languishing for
the want of capital will change hands.” It never seems
to strike the ordinary mining correspondent that capital
is languishing for the want of mines. Yet, solemnly
speaking, that is the true position of affairs throughout
Australia. Because of the millions of idle cash available,
mines in Australia are bringing a bigger price than in any
other part of the world. Money is plentiful and so are
“ wild-cats,” but good mines are scarce, and of these few
are for sale.

So far, there being no sign of general condemna-
tion of W.A. “ wild-cats ” in the Argus articles on Western
mining, by Mr. Herbert Daly, an ex-officer of Vic. Mines
Dept., the boomers are in great fettle. One, who signs
himself “ Victorian,” gives himself away by congratulating
the paper and the writer on “simply stating things as
they exist in an accurate and clear manner, and not
launching out into impossible comparisons, or his opinion
of the estimated dividend value of the mines.” He is also
quite sure that “ the general public have a very vague
idea of the little stoping done to produce the splendid
crushing results already recorded.” “ Still harping on the
Boulder group ! What about the Great Boulder ? ” is
thrown at the present writer 50 times a week. Well, if a
group of good mines, all in one comparatively small area,
is sufficient for 1000 wild-cats, on which millions of money
have been and are being wasted, then the writer will retire
from the mining arena. At present, he is inclined to think
that (without imputing any want of honesty to Mr. Daly)
the public will vote for Briggs, who had nothing to gain
by telling palpable, though unpleasant, truths.

Cosgrove’s mine, Coolgardie—what has become
of it? What is the battery doing? The public either
hears a great deal or nothing of any mine of this name.
At present it hears nothing. Forfeited shares are adver-
tised for sale, but that is not satisfying. What, too, has
become of the last rich strike in Bayley’s ? The last re-
port sayeth nothing : “ Reef 4ft. wide in Everard shaft,
no free gold.” Where, oh ! where are the Plunderderry
and the Wealth of Expectations? And in looking down
the list of English W.A. companies not floated this year
but early last, and some the year before, the same ques-
tion might be asked of 30 other mines.
•** > *
Engineers who have studied the details of the
W.A. Govt.’s proposed water-supply for the Coolgardie
fields are generally of opinion that it will involve more
than double the estimated cost and take five to six years
to carry out. This is good news for a lot of mines which,
without water, can manage to live without gold. Long
before the scheme is carried through, a railway will run
to Esperance, the present opposition of the Forrest Govt,
notwithstanding.

Norseman : “ The Queen of the West has struck
a sensational find. Seven pounds weight of pure gold
was broken yesterday close to the surface, some of the
lumps of gold being as big as a man’s fist.” One lump
should therefore weigh more than 71b. What is the weight
of the Norseman whisky?
Again from Norseman : “ The Mt. Henry
mine is creating excitement and the country is pegged for
miles. (Good old phrase !) Capt. Prout has visited the
ground and he says that there is enough payable stone in
sight on one block to keep up an output of 1000 tons a
day for 20 years.” So this one block has only 7,300,000
tons in sight—just about enough to keep a 1000-head mill
running for 100 years. And this is the sort of stuff the big
Australian dailies print as mining news !

Dr. Simon on his return to Westralia : “ It can-
not be denied that investors in London, Paris, and Ger-
many are growing anxious for returns, and, unless the
mines begin to show their value, confidence will ulti-
mately wane.” The wonder is it has'not waned long ago.
It is difficult for mines to show value without gold. The
want-of-water-and-machinery wheeze is nearly played out.
How long did the Great Boulder take to show its value
after it struck the new formation from which the whole
of its gold has come? How quickly it was followed by
the Lake View and Ivanhoe, as soon as they got on to
similar formations ! Why are there more idle batteries
within 10 miles of Coolgardie, in proportion to the number
erected, than in any other part of Australia ?

The shareholders of Block 45 at Hannan’s have
decided to reconstruct, taking 160,000 paid-up shares and
giving away 70,000 shares to find a working capital of
£25,000. Perhaps a fine thing for the future of the mine,
but for the immediate present it is a much better thing
for Messrs. Wilson and Horn, who will probably have no
difficulty in disposing of the shares at par, thereby netting
£35,000 by the deal. When this has happened it will
suddenly occur to some of the shareholders that the old
co. might have done the same thing itself and made its
own profit. Then the co. will proceed to kick itself.

W.A, newspaper hummers are not even satisfied

the lode at the 200 ft. level are going 30oz. and 40oz. to the

hundreds of tons going through the battery for an average
of about 3oz. ?

Specimens bringing <£lloo from the Queen of

submit specimens to auction would be regarded as con-
clusive evidence that the owners were not up to their
business. Madness now consists of sending the 2ewt. to
London. Since the almost immediate collapse of Bayley’s,
the Wealth of Expectations and the Plunderderry, after
each had exhibited rich specimens in London, J. Bullion
gives the W.A. specimen-mine a wide berth, and the men
responsible for any more exhibitions will probably meet
with a violent death. Golden rule—never buy into a
specimen-mine. “‘ My face is my fortune, sir,’ she said.”

As a neat example of some of the Westra-
lian alleged crushing-returns, last year a man from
London was sent to a 90-Mile lease to watch a crushing
of over 100 tons in the interests of intending English pur-
chasers, the vendors being a very influential crowd. The
result was a trifle over 3dwts. per ton, the tailings con-
taining about 2dwt. more. Hie property was declined
with thanks, but subsequently a syndicate took it up, on
the recommendation of a man who said it averaged 2oz.
to the ton. It was floated in London, and another crush-
ing took place with similar results. The reconnnender
then put on his own men, and Western papers now gravely
state that a 2oz. crushing has taken place.

All the representatives of Bull’s money don’t

The latest joke on Melbourne ’Change relates to

mising reef at Omeo,” is generally understood to be the
ex-Melbourne “sport” who started the powerful associa-
tion aforesaid in London. And the working of this reef
by the Mount Hepburn Co. figured on the prospectus as
part of a general scheme for the development of the coun-
try and the promotion of immigration. Nothing about

New Red, White and Blue Consolidated ranks

test the northern ground, where the co. thinks it has a
• large slice of the Red, White and Blue reef to work. A
successful strike there would put a heap of heart into the
Pearl.
Lazarus dawdling till the shaft gets well over
the 3000ft. mark, where crosscuts will be driven to test the

averaged a shade over 6dwt., which, however, didn’t save

Dear Bulletin,—Re Vic. Mt. Morgan. I must
admit the various reports hereon are conflicting and mis-
leading, but, all the same, the discovery is a valuable one.
Govt. Geologist Murray reported that the lode runs from
N.W. to S.E., but I am inclined to think there is no lode,
properly speaking—that the whole mountain ridge is a
mass of the peculiar formation found in the prospecting
leases. It is a sort of sandstone conglomerate, inter-
persed with quartz veins and pyrites, containing a little
gold, and, according to recent assays, a fair amount of
silver. There are numerous outcrops in all directions, so
it is impossible to say where is the beginning or end of it.
At the junction of two creeks about two miles above the
mine the fall is great and it is possible that enough water
exists to work a battery in winter, but I much question
if they will be able to dispense with steam in summer.

The Bulletin hears that at a meeting of
Oonfucians last month in Kucheng (China) it was
resolved to thank the “Australian Missionary So-
ciety for its continued supplies of lady-mission-
aries, and to ask it to send more Australee gel
by every steamer. It was stated that Confucian
males, who are studying the “modern religion
called Christianity,” are only just beginning to
appreciate the Australee gel, and that the demand
for her far exceeds the supply. It was pointed
out that the “ modern religion ” was one founded
on “love,” and that was a point at which Con-
fucians could meet young and plump lady-mission-
aries manfully.
AT A BACKBLOCKS ACCOMMODATION-HOUSE.
DAUGHTER OF ALL WORK (to traveller): “Will yer give me the
brush I gave yer to brush yer ’air; I leant to do some
scrubbing.”
TRAVELLER : “ Certainly ; and could you get me a blacking-brush
to give my boots a rub?”.
DAUGHTER OF ALL WORK : “ Yer can use this brush for them, too,
and I’ll ’ave it nicely washed by the next time yer want to
brush yer ’air.”
At the other end of this question : It is reported
that a deputation of Sydney Chinese waited upon
the Mission authorities, the other day, to protest
against the continued export to China of lady-
missionaries, of whom there were not enough to go
round among. Sydney applicants. The spokesman
was Want Kow, who said: “ Follin tlade welly
goo’. Too muchee follin tlade no goo’. Too
muchee sendee gel China. Allee nicee fat gel
teachee Chinaman go way. No goo’. Me natche-
lisee Blitishee ; me wantee goo’ gel teachee me

Hell, he too; Ah Kiss, Ah Woo, Ah Buk, and

Yet cynics ask: “What shall we do with our
girls?”

Apropos of the China - mission women’s
craze. Why don’t they look round their own
doors, where so much is to be done ? enquires a
Bulletin correspondent. Far-off fields are green,
and the “heroines” and “martyrs” leave home
to —travel at the expense of a fanatical public, and
lord it over the “poor benighted heathen.” The
country districts of Australasia offer a wide field
for work—yet helping hands are often withheld by
those who profess much. A recent Tas. case in
point: A half-witted woman with two encum-
brances, not blessed by Church-union, lost by
death her “ protector ” shortly before the advent
of a third child. Totally destitute, she had to
apply for Govt, relief to keep body and soul
together. The “ good ” folk would not help be-
cause she had led an immoral life, i.e., was not
“ married proper. ” Alone she bore her travail in
a wretched hovel. Two or three days after her
confinement she found herself without provi-
sions, and had to walk five miles to the town-
ship to procure some, carrying her infant
with her. She got a small bag of flour,
&c., and struggled back with her burdens.
The trooper, making his rounds a few days later,
looked her up and found her dying. Immediate
steps were taken to send her to a city hospital,
which necessitated 80 miles’ journey by coach and
rail, but she “ passed out ” before she reached
there. What a brutal satire on the yellow-heathen
mania ! If all men are brothers, all women are
not sisters, or cousins either; and, though charity
begins at home, there is more glory if one gives to
help those who have no direct claim on us—who
are not of our kin, but make use of what we send
them, and scoff at us in return.
The daughter of a well-
known N.S.W. squatter has
eloped and married a groom
employed on one of her father’s
stations. The lady’s choice is
said to be a steady and well-
set-up young fellow ; it is fur-
ther alleged that the squatter
shows indications of taking a
sensible view of the situation
and helping the young couple
to make the best of this
life.

Dear Bulletin, — Be the
lack of Celtic bards—every in-
telligent observer knows that
the Irish mind is unpoetical.
Irishmen are always glib, fre-
quently eloquent, talkers, with
a turn for blarney, but their
intellectual gold is mostly
coarse, very coarse. National
poverty may be solely to blame
for their vulgar sen tin it. The
more refined Irish of lad future
will breed poets. In the mean-
time, they must be content with
breeding barristers and politi-
cians.—Saxon.
“The N.S.W. Public Se-
rvice Board is, in its treatment
of teachers, considerably ahead
of the Bananaland Govt.,” re-
marks a Bulletin correspond-
ent. “Some time ago the Nor-
thern teachers (dead against
the intention of Parliament)
were severely retrenched by
the Boodlewraith, many of
them losing from 10 to 20 p.c.
of their salaries. It was openly
said in Parliament that the
Educational System was re-
sponsible for strikes and social
discords . . hence the ne-
cessity for a gradual lopping-
away of the evil tree. The
average salary in the North is
below that in N.S.W., while
the cost of living is much
higher. . . . In the face of
all this the head officials of
the Northern Education De-
partment write wailing reports
about the difficulty of getting
young men of superior intel-
lectual attainments to enter
and remain in the service—a
service which has been assidu-
ously packed with cheap female
teachers (whose only study is
the great book of Matrimonial
Prospects) and underpaid pu-
pil-teacher boy-labor.”
In re a curious judicial decision on a
divorce application recently, a correspondent asks:
“ Ought a. Judge who is supposed to be, and who
sets himself up as, a devout R.C., or who is a
member of the Anglican Diocesan Synod, to be
allowed to adjudicate on divorce matters, seeing
the decided views held by both the churches
named against divorce; it being assumed that
Judges are sincere adherents of the creeds they
profess to bolster ? ” The weakness of the question
lies _ chiefly in the assumption in its tail. The
ermine is supposed to blot out religion, always
excepting the traditional little soupgon in “ May
the Lord have mercy on your soul ! ” when a
gory sacrifice is being ordered.

Barton Bnissey is most things to most men,
and in his own slow, heavy way he fills a good
many capacities. The other day he got his mis-
sionary stop on and remarked to a Melbourne
audience: “We must all acknowledge and pro-
foundly regret that there are so many in our
midst who are m no sense true Christians and all
are -burning with anxiety to have that blot re
moved from among us.” This large, inclusive

way of putting things was evidently inherited
from the original pick-and-shovel Brassey who
made his money by fearlessly tackling the whole job.
All are conscious that all are not true Kerristians,
and all are anxious to remove the blot. The real
state of the case is that each is conscious that the
other fellow is not a true Christian and wants him
to remove the blot; for instance, the Sabbatarian
person says that Gov. Brassey is the blot himself
because he throws open his “ yot ” on Sundays.
Parson Isitt, the
Maoriland Cold Tea crank,
says that “ you cannot
take up a paper without
reading of a death caused
by drink.” The Bulletin
respectfully asks this in-
temperate shepherd if he
really thinks he is telling
the truth? This paper is
prepared to lead Mr. Isitt
by the hair to the most
convenient School of Arts,
and go through the papers
with him, taking them as
they come, and it solemnly
bets him an even keg of
rum that he won’t read of
a death which he can prove
is caused by drink in one
paper out of every four.
And it bets him two bar-
rels of beer to one that lie
won t find one such death
in one paper out of every
three. It further bets him
two bottles of whisky to
one that he can’t offer any
evidence whatever in sup-
port of his ridiculous Tozer,
and it is willing to bet
him one gin cold that he
isn’t game to attempt to
prove his statements. Also
it hereby lays two Ainur-
rikin cocktails that even a
mining expert, regarded as
an economiser of the truth,
isn’t in it with the average
teetotal statistician ; and
on top of this it lays Isitt
an even clove that he in-
vents his facts as he goes
along.
The first social occa-
sion in Sydney, when the
number of ladies present
equalled the gentlemen,
was in 1825, theeventbeing
a ball given by Mrs. Dar-
ling, the Governor’s wife.
Thus it took 37 years to
equalise the presen’able
members of both sexes in
the haut ton.
Mayor Tucker, of Adelaide, gives his an-
nual ball on Thursday, Sept. 3, and his ticklish
position has been rendered a little more difficult
than usual because women now have a vote and
he is to be a candidate for the Central district at
the next Leg'. Council elections.

While defending an “ under-16 ” seduc-

David Gaunson quoted the late Dr. Hearn’s
“ Aryan Household ” to the effect that if an Act
were passed which was not in accord with popular
sentiment juries refused to be bound by the evi-
dence, and thus put a check on inconvenient legis-
lation. This appeal to the jury to repeal the law
was unchecked by the Judge. Counsel also
brought a volume of Romeo and Juliet into court
to prove the unnaturalness of the law as it now
stands. He characterised the Act as a direct in-
centive to crime, and claimed that the time was
come when boys should be protected against girls.
The girl in this case had admitted that she told
accused she was nearly seventeen.

Apropos the Age-of-Consent question, once
more Sydney’s moral epidemic. With some, it is
deadly earnest crankiness ; with others, a wallow-
ing in upside-down vice and diseased voluptuous-
ness. The subtlety of its attractiveness is that its
disciples can mouth morality and parade maxims
while talking absolute filth all the time. Consider
a possible test of the virtue of the Social Gim-
leteers: How many parsons among them would
refuse to marry their own, or a friend’s, 16-year-
old daughter with a millionaire? Is there any
Female Apostle, now ready to sew the skirts

Elder who wouldn’t jump at a chance—or implore

“ F.” to The Bulletin :
Re “B.B.” and that “Pleasant Sunday Afternoon.”
Much of the barracking of the white-collar brigade is
towards raising the age of consent. This may be laud-
able ; but why for females only ? Why this old-time dis-
crimination of sex, this squint-eyed view of things, not as
they are here now, but as they may have been at some
other time in some other climate ? To listen to the Rev.
Hegoats one would imagine the colonial population to be
divided between male wolves and feminine lambs ; as a

matter of fact, ( the saddle is on the other horse. It is safe
to affirm that in at least half the cases our females seek
their own seduction. Is not the poor, callow youth",
preyed on by the designing beldame worthy of consider-
ation ? There are a score of Mrs. Potiphars to one Joseph
Surface, and, in bush courting, in nearly every case, the
active partner is the woman. Everywhere you will see
faded spinsters married to lads under-age, unsophisticated
youths trapped by the lures of old campaigners. And what
worries our Australian mother most is her boys —she
knows what the girls are capable of. And, grauting that
in morals Parliamentary interference is desirable, it
should go all round. “An age of consent act for girls”
would only be justified by a corresponding “ close time
for boys.”

“ Co-respondent—the right man in the
wrong place.”
Railway - Commis-
sioner Mathieson has
decided not to adopt
the patent door-closing
apparatus on the Vic.
railways. Probably he
is wise. An apparatus
which closes all the
doors simultaneously
before the train starts
and opens them all at
once when it stops
would make an im-
mense saving in wages,
but it is doubtful if it
would pay all the same.
When each door is
closed separately by an
official, he generally
sees that no one has his
head or feet or fingers
in the way before he
bangs it; besides, the
people see him coming
and take their heads
and the other parts of
them out of the road.
A machine which didn’t
come round and give
notice, but just banged
all the doors at once by
an invisible power,
would brain or maim or
scalp somebody several
times a week, even
though it gave notice
that it was going to
bang the doors by blow-
ing a whistle that rent
the heavens. In fact,
for the first seven years
or so, till people got
quite used to it, the
whistle would make
some people put their
heads in the road for
mere curiosity. Then
all these people would
sue the Government for
=£lo,ooo damages, and
the average jury, which
is always agin the
Guv’ment, would give
them big verdicts. And
even though 40 officials
swore that the whistle
was blown unto 70
times seven, it probably
wouldn’t make any difference. Unless some one
can invent a door where nobody can get his head
in the way the apparatus has its drawbacks.

Cardinal Moran, in proposing a grand
Australian Fair as another step towards the com-
pletion of St. Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney, referred
to the Holy Church festival at Melb. Exhibition
which realised =€13,000 profit, and invited Arch-
bishop Carr to disclose the secret of that glorious
loot. There wasn’t much secret about the working
of the Catholic Fair in Melbourne. The prettiest
young female members of the persuasion were_
fixed up behind stalls and “race-games,” and
utilised in every line of cash-extraction, and all
the Murphys, Dalys, Dooleys, O’Sullivans, &c.,
received official instructions to roll up and spend
their money somehow. A good few thousand
photos, of Archbishop Carr were sold on the pre-
mises at prices from a shilling upwards, and a de-
votional trade in crucifixes leavened the lump of
gambling transactions. The Fair was just a great,
giddy bazaar, with a spice of religious sentiment
dropped in at intervals. It started with Arch-
bishop Carr’s blessing, and ended in a sort of
spiritual Irish jig, and in those cases where any-
thing less. satisfactory than =£13,000 came of the
blessed shivoo the sinners confessed their little in-
discretion and got rather more absolution than
usual.

A Bulletin correspondent writes from
Kempsey, N.S.W. :
On Saturday evening, just before dark, a man with a
heavy swag tramped up the main street of Kempsey. A
few steps behind him came a woman, apparently his wife,
pushing in front of her a large box fixed on to the under-
carriage of a four-wheeled perambulator, and loaded with
odds and ends of luggage. Behind the woman came a
girl of about 12 years carrying in her arms a fair-sized
infant; and-bringing up -the-rear of the sad procession
was another youngster who plodded along with its hands
wrapped for warmth in the folds of its thin pinafore.
They were “ on the wallaby,” and had moved close on 12
miles that day; youngsters and all.

It was a judicious stroke of savoir fuire on
the part of the solicitor for a co-respondent in a

Attorney-General as his client’s counsel. It was
also another illustration of the undesirableness of
continuing the Attorney-Generalship as a political
office.

able meanness; but don’t blame the doctors.
They are asking in their own clubs twice what
the public, through the “benefit” societies, are
paying—viz., 3s. a quarter, or 3d. a week, for the
same services. The fact that we medicos do not
gauge our services to lodge patients by the pitiful
sums they pay us, does not make your remarks
any the less pertinent or pregnant of commonsense,
but it is sadly amusing to see you who

A Mother’s Appeal.
Thk following letter, dated 12th July, 1896 from
Mrs. E. J. Grien, St. Kilda, Newton, N.S.W.,
appeals to all parents : “My little boy, now aged
14 years, suffered with dropsy, which extended 111
over his body. He could not lie nor walk about,
he was such a terrible size—even his head was
so dropsical that it was twice its natural size. He
was quite blind, and his breathing was very
labored. I took him to a number of the cleverest
medical men of Sydney, but they could do nothing,
and I began to think that my poor boy was near
to his last days. One day, when passing a
chemist’s window, I saw ‘ Warner’s Safe Cure for
dropsy.’ I purchased one bottle, and, when
finished, the swelling seemed less, and his appetite
and digestion better. His digestion had been so
weak he could not take a drop of milk.
‘ ‘ I was so delighted with the change, I sent for
more Safe Cure, and now I can say this medi-
cine saved my dear boy’s life, and trust that this
may be seen by other parents who have dear chil-
dren suffering. I would like them to see what
Warner s ‘ Safe ’ Cure has done for my son.” #

A travelling Australian, who went to see the first night
of “ My Girl ” at London Gaiety, tells Tiie Bulletin that
the lady, instead of being flippant and free as of yore, is
another clergyman’s daughter, domestic, demure, saint-
like, and insipid, in long skirts of virgin white that never
rise above her ankle. The curtain rises on Charles Ilvley,
who, by way of earthly reward for his surpassing piety
and innumerable acts of ascetic virtue, has become Vicar
of Barum-Stoke. Nothing is left of the Charlie of old
“Gondolier” times save the rolling eye, the extended
arm, and the cuddle. He is sad, solemn, cadaverous,
while the white choker and upturned optics invest him
with an even greater holiness than we of Australia were
accustomed to impute to him. Like all stage parsons, the
Rev. Ryley has a daughter, “ My Girl,” which her name is
Ellaline Terriss, who comes in for the cuddle. The plot
of “ My Girl ” can be bought in any Family Herald sup-
plement. Ethel Haydon, who is in the piece, plays and
sings charmingly. Grace Palotta appears in an unbecom-
ing frock and has two speaking lines, and Florence Lloyd
is in a pretty frock and has no speaking lines at all.
A well advertised Melb. singing teacher has a talent for
discovering wonderful possibilities in the voices of most
women who come to her for an opinion. She is as popu-
lar as the ladies-doctor who advises the patient to seek a
long change of scene. “John, dear,” or “Dear papa,”
the aspirant cries, “ I’ve consulted madame, and she says
I ought to go ’Ome at once for a course of training.”
Dr. Neild’s supper-party in honor of Emelie Melville
was a gay affair, by all accounts. One guest declares that
17 toasts were properly honored, but his recollections of
the festival from the time of the eighteenth speech are
vague and unreliable.
Sydney organist Wiegand, interviewed by an Adelaide
reporter : “ ‘ You have played several pieces by Australian
composers. What do you think of these compositions?’
M. Wiegand replied to this query with such a very ex-
pressive pantomime gesture that the scribe thought it
best not to pursue the subject further”!
Judge A’Beckett opined thus in the Richardson divorce
appeal last week (Richardson had been refused a divorce
by Madden, 0.J., on the ground that he had exposed his
wife, an actress, to temptation by allowing her to join and
travel with a variety-show): “If the wife had wished to
go to Sydney with the theatrical troupe, and her husband
had objected on the ground of the temptation to which
she would have been subjected, she might well have com-
plained that he was insulting her.” It is as well for the
reputation of Poverty Pointers generally that all the
Supreme Court Judges are not Maddens.
H.: “Re theatre accidents. I was in Melb. Royal when
Bandmann’s lago stabbed Mrs. Steele’s Emilia. She
uttered a painful 1 Ah ! ’ and the people applauded ; but
lago came to the footlights, imploring someone to fetch a
surgeon. I was also in Melb. Hayinarket when Walter
Hill (Harry’s father) met with his frightful accident, being
impaled by a spike while getting over a mock-wall. The
afterpiece, ‘ Ernani ’ burlesque, was not acted, but the
Argus reported that it came off indifferently, and made
no reference to the accident.”
Why cannot Goodwin be above getting starred in a
cast ? Even Rignold is.
The Vic. country tour of the Charles Godfrey Co., under
Lohr’s management, promises to be a pretty big success.
The vocal-comedian seems to have knocked them hard at
Ballarat.
The Austral Salonists are now lionising Emelie Melville
and Shakespeare. The lady’s views on the Bard of A.
formed the staple of a recent afternoon talkee-talkee.
But why Shakespeare ? Isn’t it time some other Immortal
had a show ? William would come out so nice and reju-
venated if they gave him a rest for, say, a century or so.
Another fitting victim of a conspiracy of silence would be
Molifere.
Musin’s hair turned white in a night, over a railroad
collision.
H. : “ The onslaught upon Charles Clark, in Bulletin,
is bird-lime to a reader, as is the way with pungent half-
truths. What pleases long and pleases many must possess
some merit, as Johnson says. Clark gratifies the great
average of Dickens’ lovers in England, America and Aus-
tralia. Only a voice and a memory ! But what a lot in
that. Nor is it quite true. And Smythe, though he has
only fetched inferior histrions to Clark, is surely a bene-
ficial quack.”
One little bit of Nat Goodwin’s business as Bob Acres
recalled to mind Billy Elton, in “ Marjorie.” Both come-
dians raised a burst of horse-laughter by displaying their
hair fixed up in curl-papers.
The two ’Murkan dramatic companies now visiting this
hemisphere don’t go in for much mutual admiration. But
some of the members of one crowd agree with nearly all
of the other contingent in denouncing The Bulletin as a
scurrilous rag, for having said of them what they say of one
another.
Dear Bulletin,— A Poverty Point par. (Aug. 15) makes
it appear that Miss Yvonne Leverrier made her Melb.
dfibut at a Marshall Hall concert, and was afterwards cap-
tured for a Met. Liedertafel performance. This is incor-
rect. The Liedertafel introduced the young Sydney
pianiste to notice, with the result that the committee has
been violently reproached by a section of the Melb. press
for having ventured to look beyond the Vic. borders for
new talent. Sundry local teachers have pupils whom
they would like to put forward for advt. purposes.—E.
Nat Goodwin does not even acknowledge the authorship
of “The Ballad Monger” in his play-bills and programmes.
Several versions of the Gringoire story have been written.
If one mistakes not, the version Goodwin plays is that by
Walter Besant and W. H. Pollock, produced by Beerbohm
Tree in London five or six years ago. But why not say so
on the playbills?
Dr. Neild, the Melbourne surgeon and Shakespearian,
has an ambition to superintend the production of an open-
air representation of “As You Like It.” The difficulty is
to find a competent actress with the necessary beauty of
limb for Rosalind. The old doctor says he knows plenty
of good legs on clever girls, but the owners thereof will
only show them when necessary to their medical
advisers, and not to an admiring public. A bibliophile,
however, should know how to prize the sight of treasures
not revealed to the vulgar gaze; at least, that is the com-
fort his friends give him.
George Musgrove was so cocksure of Goodwin’s success
in Australia that he told the Mellikan man he would not
need to take more than two plays with him—“ Gilded
Fool ” and “In Mizzoura.” And the third week of the
season in Melbourne opened with “The Rivals.’
Curriculo : “The regular established Australian wander-
ing circus seems to have disappeared. Yet Ashton first,
and Burton after, made it pay well enough. It was worth
the shilling to hear Burton say, “ Ladies and gentlemen,
thanking you for your key-ind attendance, there will now
be an interval of ten min-utes.”
Fax’s omission to gather up a bouquet for the lady, on
the last night of their appearance at Melb. Princess’, was
followed by a terrible to-do behind the scenes. Trilby, it
is said, even vented ill-humor upon the floral tribute
which was viciously kicked by the renowned foot. Alas 1
poor johnnie !
Nat. Goodwin evidently sets a high value on his new
leading lady, Maxine Elliott. He commissioned someone
to meet and take care of the fair one in Sydney, and at
Melb. she was gushingly greeted by the boss in person.
Rather odd that Musin and Trebelli should be in Aus-
tralia at the same time. Wasn’t the violinist the cause,
more or less, of the notorious quarrel between Mde. Tre-
belli-Bettini and daughter Antoinette ?
Dear Bulletin,— The assertion that George Rignold
was too old and too large for his part in “Cheer, Boys,
Cheer/ is unfair. It wasn’t a young romantic lover
character, but that of a grave, middle-aged, heavy swell.
In two or three scenes, particularly in the first act, the
actor was the right man in his proper place. By the way,
physical and mental worry have reduced G.R.’s solid flesh
of late, and his stage-figure is- ten years younger than it
looked a month ago.—B.A.
Goodwin has commissioned George Gordon to paint five
scenes for him to take back to America, in addition to the
same artist’s setting for “ The Gilded Fool,” which he has
purchased from the firm.
“ A nice little sugar-plum ” was J. C. Williamson’s
opinion of “ Romeo’s First Love.”
Miss Lillie Large, who d6butted at the Queen’s Hall,
London, is a Maoriland soprano, born at Napier, and
tutored by Framezzani. Her voice is light and flexible,
well under control, and used with intelligent feeling.
Predictions of celebrity for every ardent songstress who
takes the floor at a Melb. amateur concert are sent along
to .Tiie Bulletin in paragraphs starting with : “Yet an-
other budding Melba or Crossley ! ” This is rather vague
and unsatisfactory, especially in the case of “ buds ” quite
old enough to know which sort of famous vocalist they
mean to blossom into.
One of the “ illusions ” that Carl Hertz has brought
over with him is the kinetoscope, worked on the magic-
lantern principle, with figures developed to about two-
thirds of life-size. Judging from a private trial given at
Melb. Opera House the other night, these kinetoscopical
views on a sheet are not as clear, or natural in movement,
as the peep : show pictures produced by Edison’s original
apparatus, but the effect is wonderful—perhaps too won-
derful for nine out of ten persons in a theatre audience.
The trouble will be to make them realise that hundreds
of lightning photographs are employed in the representa-
tion of an omnibus travelling across London Bridge, or of
the sad sea waves rolling in upon a strip of sandy beach.
A forgotten place of amusement is the place between
the back of Melb. Theatre Royal and the hospital, with
Little Bourke-street at one end and Lonsdale at the other.
Now a livery stable, supplying horses for Bland Holt, it
was built as Rowe’s American Hippodrome, when Rowe
first returned from America, and afterwards it was the
Prince of Wales Theatre, tenanted by the Bros. Dick and
Fred Younge. Rowe came for the third time as an em-
ploy 6of Chiarini, arid was a broken-spirited man. Once
he made heaps of money in Melb., giving grandly to the
charities.
Wallace Brownlow has taken up a lease about eight
miles out of Kalgoorlie, and is working it himself in
between his fits of working at the old musical lode.
Westralian papers report a triumphant appearance of the
Brownlow Concert Co. at Kanowna, where they gave a
programme to suit the mining soul. The co. consisted
mainly of Wallace 8., Prof. Benjamin, the club manager,
and young Horace Destree, an ex-Melbourne amateur,
who played the accompaniments and sang about half-a-
dozen comic songs. The local critic, after expressing
regret that a gentleman with Mr. Destree’s voice should
waste it upon such inferior compositions as “ The
Hebrews’ Fancy Ball,” added, sorrowfully, “ he was en-
cored, however.”
Perhaps the most gory stage tragedy on record is one
that occurred in Sweden a few centuries ago. A Passion
play of “The Crucifixion” was being performed. A
favorite actor playing the part of a Roman soldier had to
feign to pierce the side of the actor on the cross. He was
so carried away by his part that he drove his spear in
reality between the ribs of the actor and killed him.
Whereupon King John 11., who was a spectator, in his
anger killed the actor who had made the blunder. The
people, vexed at the loss of a popular performer, set on
King John and cut his head off.
Melbourne of late seems to have been saving up. its
money for “ A Trip to Chinatown.”
A sister of the Lion-comique, Leybourne, whose death
was referred to in a recent Bulletin, is married to Albert
Onesime Britannicus Gwathveoyd Louis Chevalier, the
Coster chanter, now touring so successfully in America.
In his biography, Chevalier tells rather a good yarn of an
old lady who, after hearing one of his choice costerese
items, left the provincial concert-hall with indignant
haste and the sneering remark, “ And this is an English
gentleman ! ” “ Charles Ingle,” the composer of most of
the singer’s songs, is his brother.
Pretty Miss Emily Hughes sprained her foot the first
night of “Romany Rye” at Melb. Royal, so during the
rest of the week she couldn’t fly from the villain’s clutches.
She had to limp out of danger.
Admirers of violinist Musin and' pianist Scbarf complain
that those excellent artists neglect to put on “ frill.” It
is a unique failing in professional musicians.
Tommy Hudson left Melbourne for India, with his new
co., last Saturday.
Smoking by ladies is forbidden in all the London
theatres and halls.
Minnie Palmer’s Rogers first came to Australia with a
frosty lady star.
Augustus Harris left a balance of £24,000 at his banker’s,
anyway. The approximate value of his very much mixed
estate will be arrived at presently.
Madame de Kontski, wife of the veteran pianist, is a
keen woman of business. A friend visited them the
morning after the Chevalier had played at the United
Arts Club, Sydney. “ What do you mean by keeping an
oldinan up all night?” she demanded. “My dear, my
dear,” said the Chevalier, “it gave them pleasure.”
“ Pleasure ! you ought to know better; a man of your
reputation' should never play anywhere unless he be .
paid.” The Chevalier is now ill at Adelaide. He con-.
tracted influenza, which has developed into pneumonia.
Nat Goodwin is a Boston Boy, and was on intimate
terms with Oliver Wendell Holmes, who much admired
him.
In England, most of the skating-rinks fell into the
hands of the Salvation Army—which, after this year,
takes possession of most of the Melb. rinks. “ Blood and
fire ” evidently pays.
A correspondent enquires what became of the old-time
comedian, fat Bob M’Gowan.
Nobody, writes a Bulletin correspondent, seems to
have remarked the Coleman-like appearance of Polly
Emery as Audrey in “As You Like It.” Perhaps it is the
Polly-Emery-like get-up of Coleman in everything; but,
anyhow, the resemblance is so marked that were they to
join forces they could create something of a sensation. I

Goodwin’s Shakesperian parts have included Hamlet’s
Gravedigger, Dogberry, and Bottom, in “ Midsummer
Night’s. Dream.” ,
Herr Benno Scherek, pianist to Trebelli’s Melbourne
concerts, first came into prominence before the Australian
public as Santley’s favored accompanist. His accompani-
ment of Gounod’s “ Nazareth ” was a perfect revelation to
amateurs. Later, Madame Urso, the violiniste, secured
his services on her Australian tour; and finally Scherek
settled down in Melbourne, which city he thinks affords
great opportunities for musicians from abroad.
Actress Eleanora Duse has developed melancholia of

Signor Podenzana, one of Sydney’s best ’cellists, is an

A Parren was the original Careless in the “ School for

Peter Teazle. His son, William, again, is the present
great Sir Peter, and has his son, William, familiar with the
same part. This last Farren came to Australia with Mark
Lemon’s son, in Garner’s first comedy co.

%He will at once join the North Queensland

thing much better than an organised gang of cut-

A Yic. bridegroom swore, the other day,
that neither he nor the bride had felt “ insulted ”
by some “ tin-kettlers ”, whom an active bobby
had summoned “ on his own ” ; in fact, he wasn’t
sure that he hadn’t regarded the din as a compli-
ment. And the Judges are to decide whether ss.
tines are to be cancelled. That policeman landed
his quarry on the comprehensive count of “ insult-
ing behaviour.”
When Judges Windeyer and Innes took
leave of absence and Darley and Stephen resigned
from N.S.W. Law Consolidation Commission,
Premier Reid officially announced that the country
was done with the business, and added that it was
arrant folly to set about consolidating laws, most
of which he had determined to repeal or amend.
A few nights after Attorney-General Want said:
“ The Commission’s work is not over. It must be
taken up where it has been dropped and vigor-
ously carried on, but at considerably less expense.”
Then Quidnuncs asked : “ Which head of the
Ministry will prevail?” The appointment of C.
G. Heydon and recommencement of work proves
that in this case “Jack ” is something better than
his “master.”
The N.S.W. Ministerial song in ordering
that the building of the new Sydney Houses of
Parliament be at once proceeded with is that the
edifice may be useful for the Federal Parliament.
Which is calculated to promote Federation with a
vengeance!
As the Houses of Parliament are a national and
permanent concern involving a huge expenditure,
it will be simply monstrous to shut out, as pro-
posed, all designs save those of the Government
architect. Mr. Vernon is a man high up in the
estimation of his fellows, but he may not, after
all, be an absolute Michael Angelo ; also, he was
possibly appointed just as much because he had
plenty of social influence as because he was an
excellent and reliable architect. Lord and Lady
Carington are said to have smiled very sweetly on
the proposal to give Mr. Vernon his present post.
The Bulletin publishes this issue in
its new and more commodious premises, No.
214 George-street North. Apropos of which a
friendly contemporary remarks that The Bulle-
tin’s “ present office looks larger than it really is
—plenty of ‘ front,’ but no ‘depth,’ as some critics
say erf the quality of the paper.” The “some
critics ” in question were The Bulletin itself,
which printed the gibe “to prevent its enemies
from saying it; ” but now, to paraphrase Whistler,
Oscar has said it.” Likewise, the paragraph
now being so extensively reprinted and rehashed
/, ro . m an English paper ”) about Parkes’ copy of
“ Childe Harold ” containing the signature of
Byron s ‘ lanthe ” (Lady Charlotte Bacon) origin-
ally appeared in The Bulletin in an interesting
column headed “ Parkesiana. ” So far as most of
the Australian papers are concerned, Bulletin
matter is no good until it has voyaged to England
and back.
An English religious paper publishes an
extract from the letternf a Chartered Co.’s soldier
in South Africa :
It is grand fun potting niggers off and seeing them fall
like ninepins. . . . There have been two or three
caught in the town lately and shot as spies. There is
great excitement to see them shot. Crowds go out to see
it. They are stood ten yards off the firing party, who all
—eight or nine of them—blaze at them at once. It is
quite a nice sight out here now. One gets callous
and hardened, and does not object to seeing it. At home
now, I could not see a man hung for the world. Out here
it is an amusement. Yesterday three natives were hung
for being spies. They were marched out of town about
half-a-mile. Ropes were tied to branches of a tree, they
were made to climb up, the rope put round their necks
and made to jump off the tree and drop. One would not
for some time. He would talk to Mr. Colenbrander, who
asked him at last, “ Can you see Buluwayo ? ” The nigger
said “ Yes.” So Mr. Colenbrander said, “ Have a good
look at it, as you will never see it again.” So he did, then
said “ Good-bye, Mr. Colenbrander,” then jumped off.
The cheek of the sweep amused me !
“The cheek of the sweep amused me.” J. Bull
expects the nigger shall even be hanged respect-
fully.
The latest in Melb. streets is a tandem
cycle ridden by two graceful girls in knicker-
bockers.
The Broken Hill surgeon who boned a
cadaver, as a champion of the rights of all hos-
pital doctors, because the local coroner had
ordered an outside medico to perform the post-
mortem examination of a man who died in the
hospital, hit upon a brand-new artifice. This
question of professional etiquette has been dis-
turbed before, but the Broken Hill vertebra-
annexer is the original Columbus who made that
egg to stand on end.
There is good authority for saying that the
reason why the Imperial Govt, handed over Nor-
folk Island to N.S.W., which had not asked for
it, and declined to hand it over to Maoriland,
which had asked for it and was 400 miles nearer
to it than is N.S.W., is that Bull thinks Maori-
land is drunk with Socialism. N.S.W. is believed
to be more firmly rooted in the orthodoxy of Govern-
ment.
A new (protected) industry is about to start
in Sydney in the shape of a Lager Bier brewery.
Hitherto Victorian lager has had a large sale in
New South Wales, and has proved itself a light,
refreshing beverage eminently suited to the cli-
mate. Now-a local brewery co. is in course of
formation, and, the duty-excise on local beer being
considerably lower than the duty on the imported
article, the enterprise is expected to flourish.*
Baumann’s Cafd, Pitt-st., Sydney, with
its attractive luncheon and dining rooms for ladies
and gentlemen, has lately instituted a special din-
ner served every evening, at an inclusive tariff of
two shillings, for the convenience of theatre-
parties, &c. Ladies’ afternoon tea and dainty
cakes are a speciality evoking commendation.
Wedding-cakes and pastry of best quality are for-
warded, securely packed, to any part of the colony,
and catering of every description is undertaken
anywhere. *
Vic. Assembly has just discovered that it
pays civil servants <£loo,ooo a year in “ allow-
ances,’’which it wasn’t aware of, and a violent
attack of retrenchment is imminent. The item
which roused the bile of the House worst of all is
one concerning a certain railway engineer. In
the Patterson days the Assembly retrenched this
person from .£750 to ,£668. Then the Govt, gave
him a surreptitious allowance of £l5O a year “in
lieu of increase of salary,” so his screw was really
raised to £BlB, and the Assembly tears out great
handfuls of its hair and wants to know what is
the good of it professing to have control of the
public purse if things like this are to happen. It
took .£lOB off another man, and now it discovers
that he has <£l4o of allowances, and it finds that
several other men get <£4o a year for “ increased
cost of living,” whatever that may be.
Mr. Chas. Kerry, of the popular Sydney
photographic firm of Kerry & Co., has published a
series of most interesting photographs taken in the
little-known Kiandra district of N.S.W. Kiandra
is only 24 hours from Sydney, yet the winter of
the Australian Alps invests it with a mantle of
frozen cold seven months in the year. The 60 or
70 inhabitants, and half-dozen dogs and goats,
enjoy this ; and when the glass is 42° below zero
men, women, and children travel round on their
snow-shoes like greased lightning. This Arctic
region should become a veritable sanatorium for
the heat-stricken of other districts; there for
dinner if you eat two fowls you feel light and
happy afterwards ; you melt your frozen nose and
ears and cheque before hotel furnaces as big as the
Prophet Daniel’s ; you snow-shoe with the grac<-
of youth and beauty if you are built that way,
and if not you squat toad-fashion on your
snow - shoes and toboggan down the slippery
dopes, slump. And sleep there is sleep’s ideal.
There have been some heavy falls of snow at
Kiandra, particularly in ’94. That winter old
Yorky, a local identity, was snow-shoeing home
one moonlight night. Guide-postsand telegraph
posts were buried ; Yorky was a mere wandering
speck upon a vast expanse of white. The sense of
dazzling light filled his soul with gloom ; no trees
being visible he was bushed. But just at the
moment of despair he caught sight of a trail of
smoke issuing from the snow. He steered over
to it, slowed up, stopped. Glory ! There beneath
him was a luxurious steak grilling over the hotel
kitchen-fire. He slid down the chimney to supper.
The Eucumbene rivulet runs right through
Kiandra ;itis a tributary of the Snowy. Most
of the Kiandra men are miners. When Sydney
was baking on 108° day, Kiandra was calling its
84° “ d -d ’ot. ’ ’

N.S.W. Supreme Court Bench, drawing
salaries to just on £19,000 a-year, shaped for
work in this fashion one day last week: Owen,

Manning down with grip or something; and
Windeyer and Innes abroad, one convalescing and
one hunting for a billet with more glory in it.
Emergency-men Cohen and Rogers were all there,
®f course; but they are not counted in the sum
the country regularly pays for Supreme Court
Bench-work.
One day in N.S.W. Supreme Court Salo-
mons, Q.C., was on one side of a case and Cohen
on the other, and Salomons quoted something
from a Bacon’s report, which he handed straight
to the Bench, instead of letting it go through
Cohen. “I do not like to offer Bacon to rny

Our old, but unvenerable, fat friend,

Geoffrey Drage,
recently elected
English M.P., and
formerly secretary
of the big Labor
Commission, was, it
is more than sus-
pected, a visitor to
Australia four or
five years ago. At
all events, a young
man of the most
pronounced haw-
ha wish Oxonian
type called in a
mysterious fashion
upon several promh
nent and would-be
prominent people
in two or three dif-
ferent provinces,
and on a great
many people who
were officially in-
terested in educa-
tion, “lower-class”
politics, and in so-
ciological work, and
to most of the peo-
ple he honored with
a call he gave a
book. This was the
novel, “Cyril,’’the
late editions of
which appear with
Drage’s name on
the title-page. “Cy-
ril ” is a pnggishly-
clever but terribly
diffuse study of so-
ciety and politics,
British and Conti-
nental, and was re-
ceived with a good
deal of adulation as
priggish as many of
the chapters of the
book. The interest
of Mr. Drage’s visit
for Australians lay in the belief that he was
supposed to have very high official sanction—of
the sort that can be repudiated if necessary—for
his attempt to discover the actual state of opinion
here with reference to a Royal personage as
Governor-General of the projected Federation. So
much mystery surrounded the visitor’s movements,
and so much uncertainty prevailed as to his name
that, if it were not that the book bore the in-
scription “from the author,” doubt would still
exist as to who the man was. It was suggested,
indeed, that he himself was a “ Royalty ” incog.,
but his obvious braininesß discounted that sup-
position.

Melbourne book-shops are now flowing
over with Stead’s twopenny condensed extracts of

A newly-arrived tall-hatted candidate for
literary employment in a leading Sydney news-
paper-office was lately asked, ‘ ‘ Are you an M. A. ? ”
Next, “ Are you a B. A. ? ” Next, “ Are you an
LL.D., or anything of that sort?” And, finally,
“ Are you a reverend of any kind ? ” The
answers were all “ No’s,” and, soon after, a sad-
faced man passed down the stairs and out into the
cold street.

Chief-Justice Berkeley, of Fiji, sat with
N.S.W. judges in Banco one day last week. Talk-
ing of his predecessor, St. Julian, the first Chief
Justice of Fiji, Mr. Berkeley said that the work
of the office is much less distracting and onerous
now than in St. Julian’s day. He professed to be
greatly entertained by the gossip which still
attaches to the name of the ex-Sydney law-reporter
whom King Thakombau installed as chief admin-
istrator of his country’s laws.
The tradition as to the commonness of

graduates may be averaged as a guide. Here
is its order:—Smith, 15 (including two Smyths
and one Smythe); Robertson, 12 , Sutherland, 8 ;
Brown, 8 ; Morrison, 7 ; Robinson, only 5 ; and,
most wonderful of all, Jones has but 4 to its credit.

Slattery, the self-
confessed silver - scrip
forger (he got 3| years’

and had little work to
do most of the year. He
was a great “Native,”
a church pillar, and
many think he would
have beaten Shiels for
Parliament had he tried
when asked. He re-
fused to stand “ because
his views were the same
as Shiels’,” which, in
the light of the pre-
sent, was a distinct
libel on Shiels.
The “jolly and fat”
N.S.W. Premier Reid

Melb. demise : County Court Judge Bin-
don’s widow. Bindon was a worthy, poll-parroty,
cockatoo-faced fogey, who was satirised in the
pantomimes for his shocking bad hats. Though
very correct in demeanour, he scandalised Gipps-
land, on circuit, by shooting little birds on Sun-
day. His son, barrister Bindon, instructed by
Gaunson, defended Ned Kelly, not quite in the
Aspinall way, wherefore, partly, Gaunson pleaded
that Ned ought to escape the rope.
Somebody has remarked, re the appro-
priateness of names, that one naturally associates
the name Wragg with illegitimacy and sordid
suicide or child-murder. More significant far are
the names of two children just committed to the
care of Vic. neglected children’s department.
They were respectively 7 and 8 years old, and had
been living in a house with no furniture, and only
half a quilt and two bran-bags to cover them.
Their grandfather, aged 80, could sometimes earn
1/6 per week, sometimes nothing. Their mother
appears to have deserted them. Their names are
George Grieve and Elsie May Grieve.

Sp:;gn >letti : “Pastor Marshall, of the
Melb. toniest Scots Church, is great on obituaries
of the pious wealthy, who drop into the grave
about once every three weeks, ; but, I think, no-
body ever heard of his unearthing a poor saint in
Sabbath eulogy. Excellent Johnston, of the
Argus, came in for the slab last Sunday, with the
conventional whine about the present generation
being no good. How the parsons kootoo to their
bitterest enemies, the newspapers ! ”
Premier Reid never eats baker’s bread,
in consequence of a disgusting sight he saw in a
bakehouse, where a drunken baker was work-
ing, some years ago. G.H.R. ate no bread next
day, and when on tour generally contrives to take
with him a small supply of home-made. Owing to
a somewhat cognate occurrence, not unconnected
with a dairy presided over by two sore-eyed black
gins, Mr. Reid’s immediate predecessor in office,
Parkes, for some years took no milk in his tea.
Mr. C. G. ' Heydon has undertaken fro
gratuituously consolidate the statutes of N.S.W.
Mr. Heydon is a good lawyer of unspeakable in-
dustry and conscientiousness, and so careful of
detail that he has been styled “ the microscopic
Mr. Heydon.” He is an uncompromising moralist
with the mental bias of a prosecutor, and on the
bench —he has more than , once been an acting
Supreme Court Judge- inexorable a's Rhadaman-
thus. He began his career as a banker, and, so
far as icy reetitud -■ is concerned, will certainly
■ start the next world as an angel with a double halo
DOMESTIC AMENITIES.
SHE: “ What would you be if it were not for my money? ”

When Dick Seddon, M.L.’s present Pre-
mier, came over from Melbourne to the West
Coast in ’66 and swung a lusty pick-and-shovel on
the Greenstone rush, he chummed in casually with
two brothers on the next claim. One of them waa
named Dan ; the other, as a matter of course, was
Bill. After a while, Bill resolved to take a run
“ home,” from which he had been many yeaija
absent, and there he learned that his sister had
married one Seddon, and that a large, hulking soji
had grown up and recently departed for Maorj-
land. Seddon had accidentally run up against his
own uncle Bill and his other without any
one of the party understanding the situation.
There is some discusssion among the sculp-
tors of the various God-fearing N.S.W. Ministers
as to the medium in which their remarkable heads
should be finally “ done ” with a view to preserva-
tion in imperishable form. As far as Reid is con-
cerned, it’s a toss-up between soap and brass.
Jpe Cook might be done in sealing-wax—post-office
sealing-wax; Gould in alabaster, as the nearest
approach to ice; Garrard ip gold without alloy,
as a specially God-fearing Minister ; Brunker in
tallow; Carruthers in putty; Syd. Smith, ajs
Minister for Agriculture,- might have his head
carved out ;of a prize pumpkin; anjd Jack Wanjfc
should be done in common clay, as'the only self-
oonfessed human being in the lot.
The Samuel Marsden memorial business is
not likely to “catch on ’’ to any dangerous extent.
Firstly, many classed as his admirers know that
his character won’t bear close .'examination.
Secondly, there are for all, except greedy persons,
quite enough memorials of the rev. -ex-blacksmith
in Australia and elsewhere', In the church of his
native village in England there is a tablet to him ;
St. John’s, Parramatta, has a memorial; and All
Saints church at Marsfield was built to honor him.
Besides, Dean Cowper, of St. Andrew’s, Sydney,
is a living memorial of the rough-and-ready and
often ferocious politipo-bvangelifet, for it was
Marsden who took away the dean’s father from
rural England and started the family in the shep-
herd business on the west of Wyn’yard-square.
About £BOOO has been recovered out of
the ,£lO,OOO in gold which went down in the
Catterthun many months ago. Considering the
depth—just on 160 ft. —at which the divers had to
work, the strong currents, and the fact that the
wreck lay in the open waters of the Tasman Sea,
it was the most remarkable diving feat on record,
and the two men, Briggs and May, who fetched
up the lost bullion richly deserve tne <£7so apiece
which they receive. It is eerie work, wandering
among the recesses of a lost ship on the sea bottom
—especially a ship whose passengers mostly went
down with her, so that their sodden bones are liable
to be met with at any turn in the regions below
decks—where the big shark and the conger-eel and
octopus come to eat the sunken crew. Diving with
modern appliances is a solemn way of making a
living, and the man who goes dynamiting Chubb
locks 50 yards below the surface and poking round
in the green twilight at the bottom of the ocean
looking for lost treasure must, if he possesses the
imagination of a normal human being, deserve all
the money he makes at his industry. The expense
of the prolonged search for the Catterthun’s gold
was great, but still there is a large profit left
in the enterprise. The underwriters are now sell-
ing a lot of the recovered sovereigns at a guinea
each, as mementoes —the odd shilling going in
aid of the Shipwreck Relief Society.

POLITICAL
POINTS
“ Freetrade can never be other than a
variable expedient.”—Frederick Greenwood.
The difference between the Devil and the
politician is that the politician is blacker than he
is painted.
Minister Young says the Reid Govt, will
last till 1900. That would mean altogether a con-
secutive six years’rule and majorities in at least
three consecutive general elections.
Brisbane Courier has the front to propose
a second vote for Ministers and ex-Ministers of
the. Crown, and talks grandiloquently about the
“ high worth of their patriotism and patent record
of service done.”
All the good-looking men in S.A. Assembly
are against woman-suffrage ; and the hard-faced
politicians who would ornament a chain-gang are
for it almost to a man. The ugliest politicians
are.the most enthusiastic on the subject.
Old Frederick Sargood, M.L.C., alleges
that Vic.. Legislative Council “ rests on a sound
democratic basis.” Think of the dreadful Sargood
—the man who is against every semblance of re-
form—being on a democratic basis ! He would be
more comfortable on an iron spike.
N.S.W. Premier Reid went to the country
last year on the burning question of reforming the
Leg. Council. He never attempted to reform it.
He merely deformed it. To-day the Council is as
cantankerous and as people-defying as ever. Reid
is keeping “ reform of the Council ” as an ever-
lasting trump-card up his sleeve.
The electors of Melbourne province show
no disposition to shift Robt. Reid from the Leg.
Council. Flinders Lane runs the show with the
assistance of cherubic Dr. Bevan, and the soft-
goods representative will be returned unopposed,
seemingly. Robt. Reid, as a “ successful public
man,” is an irritating mystery to a good many
people.
“HIS MATE’S ALIVE!” — From, Henry Lawson’s volume of
sketches , “ While the Billy Boils.”
The stock inspectors appointed by Q.
Govt, to cope with the tick trouble appear to be
largely composed of needy Ministerial hangers-on,
with no knowledge of or fitness for the work.
Victoria lias been
crying out for years
past for a reform of
the insolvency law
and the law relating
to companies, yet the
measures dealing
with these two re
forms were on the
point of being strand-
ed 2C times over for
want of a quorum.
Both bills struggled
through comm i ttee
in an almost empty
House, and all t! >e
work on them was
done by about a
dozen members. The
rest stayed away—■
except at divisions
because they didn’t
care for such dreary
work, or didn t un-
derstand it, and were
too lazy or too stupid
to learn. But if the
Council throws out
these two bills or
amends them out of
all shape, reckoning
that where the As-
sembly is so indif-
ferent it can do
pretty much as it
pleases, the howl of
the men who stayed
away will rend the
heavens, and they
will want to know
why the Government
they are too tired to
support doesn’t rise
and do something
great and awful at
once.
Brisbane Courier pleading for a plurality
of votes :
The idle, self-indulgent, discontented elements in the
community die out or migrate. The industrious, thrifty,
thoughtful element stays on. Therefore, we say let a
citizen of twenty years’ standing have a second vote.
In every Bananaland coast-town there are hun-
dreds of industrious, thrifty citizens who are con-
tinually transporting themselves, and often their
families, in the search for work; there are also
hundreds of loafers and drunkards who live for
twenty years on the same old booze, in the same
old street, within hail of the same old pub. . . .
Evidently Queensland is booked shortly for a
Redistribution of Seats Bill and a fancy franchise.
Considering
that the N.S.W.
gaols yield practi-
cally nothing in the
shape of cash value,
and that the prison-
ers are not employed
on any kind of work
that gives a decent
return for - their
labor, and that
whenever any at-
tempt is made to
employ them in pay-
ing occupations a
wail goes up about
them competing
with free labor out-
si d e considering
all these things, The
Bulletin suggests
salt-making as an
industry which
might fill a large
gap. N.S.W. spends
about £60,000 a year
on imported salt. If
importation was
wholly prohibited,
and salt made a
State monopoly, and
the industry run
wholly by prison
labor, it would com-
pete with no free in-
dustry in- the pro-
vince. And if the
Prison department,
with no wages to
pay, and no eight-
hour movement, and
no strikes, couldn’t
supply the country
at present prices or
even less, then some-
body evidently
wants to be kicked
hard.
English Co-
operative Delegate
Clay : “We think
it is only right that
we should do some-
thing with our own
colonies in prefer-
ence to sending so
much money to other
countries.” “ Our
own colonies! ” The
voice of the world-
owning Hinglishman ! Australia owns nothing—
not even herself.
A rude and effective assault was lately made
bySleath, M.L.A.,upon the pious self-complacency
of N.S.W. Col. Sec. Brunker during the debate
on the financial statement. Sleath described Mr.
Brunker as an incompetent humbug who lived on
his hair and his eternal professions of integrity.
As it was delivered in Committee early in the
morning it was not reported, but it was un-
doubtedly the most trenchant attack yet made on
the ill-founded political reputation of the Colonial
Secretary.

THE BIRD-CAGE,—PRETTY POLLY!
Remarkable how public opinion influences
even the Law. Melb. Trades Hall unionists now
freely stick about posters, warning the public
against certain employers, by.name.
A custom is springing up in certain N.S.W.
Protectionist quarters for leading men who are
announced to speak at meetings to come in late
and attract applause on squeezing on to the plat-
form. One ex-M.P. for Northumberland in recent
years carried this to a fine art, and the expression
of startled surprise which overspread his counten-
ance on finding himself an object of applause
would have done credit even to George Rignold.
Leg. Council Franchise Extension Bill,
which would have enfranchised 15,000 lease-
holders and others, was carried in S. A. Council by
12 votes to 11, but as an absolute majority of the
House was needed, the measure lapses for this
session. The Kingston Govt, has been much
blamed for not originating the Bill in the Assem-
bly, as there is a large majority in favor of it in
that chamber. Magarey and Campbell, M’sL.C.,
alleged democrats, voted with the Ass party.
Vic. Government is going to try its hand
at another Bill for abolishing the property suf-
frage and giving one vote to every man and woman
in the province, and the Council is getting ready
to heave out the hated measure once more. The
struggle between the two Houses in Victoria is
the fight between the elephant and the whale over
again—a combat between the man who has no
hands and the one who has no feet. The One-
adult-one-vote Bill should bring things to a crisis
if the two institutions could get at each other—
but, unluckily, they oan’t.
An old-established Kyneton (Vic.) solicitor
was dragged up the other day before Judge
Williams for retaining a lady-client’s money ever
since 1890, and flatly refusing to give any account
of it. He was suspended for 12 months certain,
and thereafter further suspended until he paid up
the ill-gotten coin. Under these arrangements he
has no interest in paying the money until his 12
months’ suspension is just expiring, and the client
may look for her cash in August, 1897. What
other profession is there in which a man who has
misappropriated trust money for six years or
so, gets another 12 months in which to settle up ?
It is understood that Vic. Assembly will
dissolve next April if things go well, and if “things
go badly it may dissolve earlier-. The general im-
pression is that the batch of Leg. Councillors who
go for re-election in Sept., and who include many
of the Government’s most inveterate opponents,
will mostly be returned almost unopposed. And
the further impression is that the same people
who return them will send Turner back in April
with a big majority, and having thus fixed up the
same old deadlock once more will want to know
why the Government doesn’t “do something.”
The Vic. public apparently can’t understand that
so long as it lets the same fossils drift back to the
Council no Government can do much. The one
effective remedy would be to provide on the esti-
mates a salary of £4OO or .£5OO a year for each
Councillor. Then a rush for the M.L.C.-ships
would set in that would sweep Fatman right off
his legs. It would take about £5OO a year to do
it; the constituencies are so much larger and elec-
tions consequently so much more expensive than
those for the Assembly that a big salary is neces-
sary.
B. R. Wise writes to Sydney daily press
rubbing salt into the wounds inflicted upon Reid
by M‘Millan, and thus brings into view a political
combination, on which Reid will have to keep his
weather-eye. Wise and M‘Millan have never
been very close j>olitical associates, representing
as they do two diverse streams of political thought
on Freetrade. M‘Millan stands for “sound and
safe ” conservative legislation, with no disinclina-
tion to revenue-tariffism, tempered by M‘Arthur
and Co., and “good Government”; while Wise
stands for speculative Henry Georgeism, and
advanced taxation with “ exemptions on incomes
of ability.” For the rest, both men are far abler
Rarliamentarians than any on Reid’s side of the
House, and outside command two different kinds
of support, which may or may not be reconcil-
able. They both have a legacy of revenge from
their old chief, Parkes ; to say nothing of a big
personal score to be wiped out. Both were offered
the leadership of the Freetrade party when Parkes
retired in a huff and it was going begging. Both
refused, on the evident assumption that Parkes
was indispensable. All these little rivers run into
one big stream, and Reid will have to fight for
dear life when waters are not so smooth as now.
While M‘Millan and Reid are making and
losing reputations—the public can take its choice
which loses and which gains—over the financial
position of N.S.W., the Opposition financiers pre-
serve a judicious silence on details. Indeed, Lyne
and See were at sixes and sevens on the actual
delinquencies of the Treasurer in their speeches,
and both disagreed with M'Millan, while all of
them were at loggerheads with Reid. What a
puzzle N.S.W. finance must be when three past or
present Treasurers and an ex-Minister for Works
are making the air blue with their contradictions !
When Chinese who cross over into N.Q.
are captured and found to have no money, what
is done with them? “They are detained in cus-
tody,” is the usual Governmental reply. But
somebody asked Home Secretary Tozer the other
day—“ How long?” And then the beautiful
State system intended to put practical difficulties
in the way of the Chinesing of Australia fell to
pieces. “ What’s the use of keeping them in cus-
tody when they have neither food nor money?”
answered Tozer. “Of course, they pass out. into
the general population to make a living for them-
selves.”
There is a puncture in the tyre of the Vic.
Parliamentary Labor-party. The feeling between
I lancock and Prendergast was illustrated a few
nights since. Prendergast was raising a stonewall,
but Hancock wanted to catch his last train home.
“ Cut it short,” said Hancock. “ The hon. mem-
ber who interrupts is very rarely here at this time
of night,” said Prendergast. “It would be a
good thing if you weren’t,” retorted Hancock.
Now the two champions of Labor mutually de-
nounce each other to their respective groups of
adherents. Yet the quarrel is premature. Tren-
with’s shoes are not empty yet, and if they were,
neither Hancock nor Prendergast is fit to fill them.
All the reasons which determined the U.S.
Constitution-makers to deny to Washington, the
seat of Federal Government, a vote in the national
elections apply with equal force to the city in
which the Parliament of a Federated Australia
shall assemble. Have those Sydney Exhibition-
artificers who endeavor to justify the erection of
their doll’s-house by hinting that Sydney may be-
come the seat of Australian Government given the
necessary amount of thought to this aspect of the
business ? Are Sydney and its suburbs likely to
accept disfranchisement even for the sake of hous-
ing the national representatives? This question
should be definitely settled before one pound of
money is voted for the construction of a building,
one of whose uses, the proprietors say, will be to
serve as a Federal Parliament House.
BUT SUPPOSE THE OTHER FELLOW
BUCKS.”
“The Legislative Council of Victoria is now
placed on a firm democratic basis.”
SARGOOD, M.L.C.
Ex-Minister Yale, who has just quitted
the Turner (Vic.) Cabinet, says that he pointed
out how at least ,£lOO,OOO a year more could be
saved on the civil service, but his colleagues lacked
the grit to carry out his plans of retrenchment.
Also, that he showed a possible saving of .£50,000
a year in the Post-office alone, whereupon that
frivolous Mike, Postmaster-Gen. Duffy, sacked
one man. He wasn’t one of the men recom-
mended for retrenchment, and he was the post-
master in Yale’s own electorate. Whereupon Vale
threw his portfolio at Duffy’s head and left.

A Mrs. Charles Comstock, of Fisher s

seven children at one confinement —four girls and
three boys. All doing well. The record.
A German, charged before Bundaberg (Q.)
Bench with the larceny as a bailee of <£so, en-
trusted to him by a kanaka for safe-keeping, cross-
examined Tommy Tanna : “ Didn’t you give me
the money to inwest for you in my business ? ”
Tommy: “Yah.” Prosecuting counsel: “Do
you understand what that fellow mean when he
say inwest?” Tommy: “My word ; that b-
fellow been waste my money ever since I give it to
him.” Prisoner committed, but duly acquitted by
a jury of his “ fellow-countrymen.”
From South Afrit a. Briton : “The British
Empire is so great that the sun never sets upon it.
Boer: “No doubt. The Deity would never trust
John Bull in the dark.”
‘ ‘ Ceremonials are very well to look at, but
I can imagine nothing more uninteresting than to
read exhaustive and exhausting accounts of them.
A sincere, straightforward, historical narrative
would be unobjectionable, but it is part of the
conventionality of the occasion that the scribe
should write in a vein of exalted and insincere
adulation, leaving on the mind of the independent
reader a curious impression of pretentious servility
and snobbishness.” —A London journalist on the
Czar's coronation mummery.
Ed. Bulletin, —If anything could surprise
me,, your par. of Aug. 1 would do so. I am
charged with anarchial tendencies, and this after
many years of stubbornly fighting that madness.
The next thing will be to accuse me of being a
full-blown Roman Catholic. True, the row in our
association did spring out of practical anarchy,
certain members having developed that disease
badly, and vowing to drive me out of Melbourne
because I laughed at their fad and otherwise
opposed them. The hall was not half, but quite,
built ; and I lectured in it from May, ’B9, to
March, ’9l. When I tell you that our law-s'iit
against (he trustees was the very first case tried
by the now notorious Madden, you will fully
understand our failure. The other Judges had
not grown independent of the Chief when our
appeal against his decision was made; and they
reluctantly and with damning admissions con-
firmed his decision. Ino more expect to get jus-
tice from our Judges than to become a bishop.
The poetical embellishments re my laughing out of
the window and sitting weeping and raving amid
the ruins are not bad for romance, and they tend
to show that invention is not a lost art or “ gift ”
in literature. —Jos. Syhes.
The Illinois Staats Zeitung, a Chicago Tory
paper, thus advises: “Just as the corn-louse and
similar insects are driven out by setting against
them certain other insects that devour them and
their eggs, so should the State cultivate and rear
anarchists in the principal nests of Socialism, and
leave to the anarchists the work of destroying
socialists. The anarchists will do the work much
more thoroughly than either police or district
attorneys.”

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The argument re the inclusion of Ranjitsinjhi
in the English test-team, that the Indian prince learnt all
his cricket in England does not affect the matter,” re-
marks “ Australian Abroad ”to The Bulletin. “It is his
national physical characteristics, his wonderfully supple
wrist and keen eye, that make him such a clever batsman.
“Clem Hill was nearly being omitted from
the Australian team in the second test-match ; he has of
late so frequently failed through a desire to score by pul-
ling straight balls to leg.
“Jones, before the second test-match v. Eng-
land at Manchester, complained of having strained the
muscles of his side. A day’s rest and liniment did him
little good, but it was finally decided that he must be
played at all risks, otherwise, with Eady disabled (a
strained arm), the Australians would be absolutely without
fast bowling.
“ Trott stood out of the Leicester match and
went to see the Stanbury-Harding boat-race ; Giffen con-
sequently captained the team. He was wonderfully success-
ful bowling in the first innings, when he secured 8 for 30
runs; and in the second he got 6 for 89. He, however, kept
himself on from beginning to end of the second, and in
the last hour he was plainly tired. The last Leicester
man came in at 5.30 and stumps were to be drawn at 6.
If the last two men played out time it was a draw, if not
it was an Australian victory by an innings and 300 runs or
so. At one end Giffen gave Donnan a few overs, then
Eady an over or two, but he himself kept pegging away
at the other end. Trumble ought certainly to have had
more of a chance than two overs at such a time, and this
craze of Giffen’s for bowling himself again shows how im-
possible he is for a captain.
“Old Trafford wicket is always a trifle slow,
otherwise it could not possibly have been better than for
the second test-match. Trott won the toss, and had a
good advantage in getting first knock. The weather was
bright and charming as far as Manchester weather can be,
and there were fully 15,000 people present when Iredale
snicked Richardson for four the first ball of the match.
“ Against Hampshire the Australians made 462;
against the Players, 454; and against Leicester, 584; or
exactly 1500 runs in three consecutive innings—a record
performance.
“ The receipts of the Australian team up to the
close of the Hampshire match—half the tour—were £lOOO
ahead of the ’93 takings. If this increase is kept up, and
it probably will be, for the team is now much talked of,
some of the careful ones (and r.here are three or four) will
have a big lump to draw at the end of the trip.
‘ ‘ Fourteen Englishmen attended at Old Trafford
for the ‘ All-England ’ (assisted by Ranjitsinjhi) second
test-match. Grace made the final selection half-an-hour
before play began. He decided to leave out Lohmann,
Pougher, and Mold. Pougher we saw get a nasty blow on
the knee the day before at Leicester from Donnan’s bowl-
ing; but it was wonderful with what unanimity the three
omitted professionals “ told the old man my leg was bad,
or my arm was bad,” as the case may be. The profes-
sionals requested to attend to plav if called upon get
their money whether or no, but the advt. of the inclusion
in an English team—and the honor —is highly prized.
Double fees (£10) are paid for these matches.
“On no ground in England do the Gentlemen
and Professionals come out at the same gate ; nor do they
dine together. For instance, E. Jones, Esq., of Broken
Hill, would never be called upon to eat at the same table
as Richardson, the Surrey professional.
“At Lord’s, 43 reporters filled the press-box
during the first test-match, while 44 found places during
the second at Manchester. Of these, two men represent-
ing Pardon’s Cricket Reporting Agency (late Wisden’s)
and two men representing the Sportsman Agency supply
over 80 papers with results. In addition there are other
smaller agencies and perhaps 30 pressmen on the ground
who never enter the box.
“When Iredale had made his hundred in the
second test-match he walked the full length of the wicket
to Trott, who was in with him. They shook hands effu-
sively. Whether this was all Iredale went for or whether
he wanted to borrow something from his captain on the
strength of it, the great crowd of 25,000 spectators, who
had assembled by that time, could not tell.
“ And the boys rolled up . . the bloomin’ sacri-
fice to see ” on the Thames between Putney and Mort-
lake on 13th July. It was seriously stated and universally
accepted as correct that Stanbury’s ‘innards’ were so
flaked with fat that, at every st roke he pulled, the liquefied
margarine either clogged the valves of the heart or so
copiously exuded from his pores that he was unable to
get a body-purchase from which to ‘ put his shoulders
into it.’ Thus the only advantage the Australian pos-
sessed was as an oil-spray in case of ‘ troubled waters,’
and the ‘ Little Wonder’s ’ lightness was thought likely to
counterbalance that by enabling him to skim, like an
arrow, on the crests of the waves. Every paper that
ventured an opinion gave the muscular little Englishman
as the winner, and yet he was hopelessly outclassed, and
beaten after the first score of strokes.
* * * *
“ Stanbury, by so easily beating Harding, has
lost all chance of rowing any other Englishman.. Atone
point he rested on his sculls for a few moments and the
crowd shouted exultingly : ‘ He’s done ! he’s done ! ’ but
their ecstasy was very short, for Jim, putting in three
long, powerful strokes, immediately pulled up the two or
three lengths by which his lead had been reduced. There
was a lot of talk about Harding being able to beat Stan-
bury, but bookmakers of any repute would not lay against
the Australian. The match is not mentioned now, for
Englishmen really can’t stand a licking. Had Harding
won he would have been flooded with challenges.”
“Hammersmith Bridge, after the Stanbury-
Harding Chinaman cortfege : Disgusted pearl-buttoned,
over-clothed British workman removes his pipe, relieves
his mouth and his feelings in order—‘ Well, I’m con-
demned ! Pore old John Bull wopped agine ! Hit’s my
opinyun that in hathletiks John Bull hain’t no crimsun
clars ! ’
“At Henley, the four-oar races were rowed
without cox’uns, the steering being managed by rudder-
lines on the stroke’s feet. The Yale College (U.S.) crew
raced in a paper-boat, and might as well have been made
of paper for the sorry show they gave. When is Australia
to send a crew ?”
* * * *
Hitherto Murdoch’s 1711, in 1882, is the largest
aggregate compiled during any Australian cricketing tour
in England.
* * * *
Out-to-leg : “I never travel in the railway past
Richmond, Melb., cricket-ground without thinking of the
English lion-hitter, Griffiths, who sent the ball right over
Punt Road,- into the Cricketers’ Arms bar.”
* » » •
George Lohmann has been quite a failure
against the Australians this time—bowling average poor
batting average 0, or thereabouts.
* * * *
Little Abel will come out with the best average
among the English pros, this season for all matches, as
well as the Anglo-Australian events. And his grim com-
rade, Richardson, stands out, after all, as the only bowler
who has always troubled the visitors on good wickets
and the most likely to be chosen for the English team
that will attack Australia next year.
* * * *
“ In sturdiness and evenness of form the Aus-
tralians have proved themselves superior to the best
eleven that could be chosen to represent All England ”
says London Daily Chronicle. Which nobody can deny
If Stoddart’s next team is to win test-matches on hard
Australian turf he will have to bring six or seven of the
very best English batsmen who can resist the temptation
to make uppish strokes. Looking back at the names of
Stoddy’s last crowd, it seems wonderful that they should
have won the rubber, a success due partly to the cap-
tain’s example in playing a much less dashing game than
he is noted for at Home, and partly to the comparative
softness of Australian bowling at that time. Brown, it
seems, takes no credit for winning the final test in Mel-
bourne. He reckons that the bowling on the last day was
ridiculously easy to hit, and he shone merety in the
matter of making up his mind to whack it about.
* * * *
Bails: “The compiler of the World’s Cricket
Eleven forgot a wicket-keep.”
* * * *
In a match between Cambridge University and
A. J. Webbe’s Eleven, young Albert Trott was the only
professional engaged. He had the distinction of being
the only player who didn’t get a “Mr.” before his name
in the newspaper reports.
* * * *
Geo. Giffen told the writer, the day before he
left for England, that, every man playing to form, the
present Australian team was (from a touring point of
view) the strongest batting combination in the annals of
cricket.
» * * *
The sun shone on last Saturday’s meeting of
N.S. W. Wheelmen’s League, and the muscle-worshippers
got filled to the brim with the excitement of sensational
finishes. Had gods been racing instead of men, the
leather-lunged 15,000 could not more frantically have
hailed each victor.
There was a tremendous outburst when Mead-
ham (N.S. W.) and Walne (Q.) fought desperately down the
straight for victory in the August Handicap final. Walne
won—not by a half-inch, but by three-eighths. As he
flew over the last 100yds. he could hear the mighty voice
of the Sydney barraekers bellowing “Meadham! Mead-
ham! Meadham wins!” “D d if he does!” said
Walne to himself, and he set his teeth and lasted out the
challenge. Wally Kerr, one of the coolest and best judges
of a race, was certain that Meadham won. But the
majority of those in a proper position to judge gave the
win to Walne. Meadham, who once more showed he had
no bundle, thought he had made a dead-heat of it.
Davison (N.S.W.) won the Winter Stakes very
easily, as anticipated ; the only thing he appears to re-
quire is a block of ice inside his cap. He bullocks instead
of racing with judgment; in his August Handicap heat
he made the pace for Meadham and O’Brien right through,
and once in the straight for home those clever riders
downed him for his pains.
The great Bilmai'tin was himself again last
Saturday, and had he not been badly blocked several
times in the final of the Aug. handicap he might have
been first instead of fourth. But in the Ten-mile Scratch
race he plugged along in his customary resolute style,
always hanging just “ thar,” or jigging suddenly to the
front and then as suddenly dawdling while in the lead —
a dodge to slow the race. And when the last lap came
he set-to with Martinic grimness, and neither M'Donnell
(Amor.) nor Body (M.L.) could challenge him in the
straight.
This is the first time that Martin has met
M'Donnell in a long distance. M'Donnell proved himself
a cool, clever rider, but he will have to lay in more sprint
and stamina to beat Martin in their match. The only
reason why Martin should not beat M'Donnell is because
the famous Bill has now been training three years with-
out one proper interval of holiday. Yet, judged by the
way Martin collared his field in the first two laps in his
heat of the August Handicap, he is not stale.
Martin is a rare good horse to carry anybody’s
money, because he has a happy knack of “getting
there.” When an expert boxer went for the uninitiated
William one day in the dressing-room, M. crowded
in and slogged off skin and hair most unscientifi-
cally. But he got there. The other man was carried
home for repairs, but W.M. went out on his cycle with
his iron jaw set for victory.
So far Martin is the brainiest and best-lived
cyclist in Australia. He does exactly the things he ought
to do, and he leaves undone the things he ought not to
do ; he goes to bed every night at 10 ; and he realises that
a racing cyclist’s biggest bundle is a girl.
Ken Lewis (M.L.) rode a very lucky and un-
lucky race in his heat of the August Handicap. He stole
up and up and up—on the inside all the way, and was
winning easily when Middleton (Vic.) rushed past to
snatch a win.
Walne (Q.) won his heat of the August Handi-
cap (1 mile), won that race’s final (£50); and by a magni-
ficent sprint won the Final Handicap, 3 miles (£l5). He is
a light, wiry, compact athlete—has a trunk as round as a
gum-tree.
Quong Tart, the starter, had to go near the
crowd once when firing the pistol. He remarked after-
wards : “ They chaff me over there ; ‘ Scotch Haggis,’
they say ; ‘ Cornin’ thro’ the Rye,’ Scotch gammon, and
so on ; I laugh. ‘ All li, ole f’lah,’ I say.”
The hearts of the quad could be heard thump-
ing against their ribs, and those of the spectators stood
still, as, when the four riders were pacing Don Walker
(Vic.) in the half-mile dash, James, the steersman, missing
his pedal caused the machine to swerve and rock fear-
fully. To have come down at that pacing gait would
well, it would have been a splash advt. for the ambulance
corps, which takes a benefit shortly. Walker did the
half-mile in lmin. 0 2-ssec. ; the rest of the half mile
dashes were struck out of the programme.
Middleton (Vic.), after he and Lewis had won
the Tandem Race, ground his teeth and shook his fist at
Elliott and M'Coonibe, who ran second. A lap and a-half
from home the latter pair nipped across Lewis and Mid. so
sharply that a smash was averted by a hair’s-breath. And
so, having won, Middleton bounced off his machine, and
with the fire of battle in his eye but friends swarmed
round.
* * * *
Sydney footballers are making wild efforts to
reach Melb. fight-record standard. On Saturday (Aug. 17)
a losing team (Carolinas) attacked the umpire, who was
saved by a policeman. The barraekers of the other club
were, however, knocked down, and a free fight with bricks
followed. The barraekers fled to an empty house and
were rescued by the police. On the same day a row took
place at the University over the ball, and soon became
general. Hysterical mothers and sweethearts forced
themselves into the rumpus and fainted, while children
were trampled underfoot. The unfinished match wasn’t
resumed.
* * * *
At a late football-match in N. Melb., an enthu-
siastic sympathiser with the visiting Collingwoods wrought
havoc with “ something wrapped up in brown paper.”
The “ something ” was generally believed—considering
the way in which men went down before it—to be an iron
bar. It turned out to be a copy of “Sweet Alice, Ben
Bolt.” The only wonder is that the injuries received from
this frightful weapon didn’t prove fatal.
* * * *
First-class Rugby in Sydney has already petered
out. The Wentworth-Randwick meeting this Saturday is
a challenge affair, and two sultry spells are expected. The
proceeds very properly go to an ambulance corps.
* * * *
The touring Queenslanders are striking bad
patches in M.L. One town put in a team averaging over
13st., and the visitors had to look on. M.L. athletes ap-
pear to be getting bigger every year.
» * » •
Gov. Brassey and his spouse were largely starred
as an additional attraction to the big South Melbourne v.
Collingwood match last Saturday, posters headed by their
portraits being profusely scattered over the city. Yet
“ Uncle Tom ” and Madam cleared out at half-time,
evidently disgusted at the game being so ladylike, after
all they had read of late.
* * * *
If the leading Melb. football teams had planned
an attempt to revive old-lime interest in the champion-
ship, they couldn’t have arranged last Saturday’s results
differently. But football frenzy is a thing of the past.
* * * *
Melb. senior football interest reached its height
on Saturday when S. Melb. played Collingwood, and Melb.
Essendon. At S. Melb. Gov. Brassey watched his first
game of Vic. football, the heaviness of which seemed to
sit flatly on his soul. Collingwood, after a hard, even
game, just managed to make a draw with South, who
scored 3g. 10b. to 3g. sb.
Melbourne, now about the best team playing
football down South, followed up last Saturday’s Colling-
wood victory by walking over Essendon. The Red-and-
Blacks, quite out of the hunt, greatly missed several of
their best (injured) players. Nevertheless, Melb.’s 7g. lib.
to Essendon’s sg. 3b. was well-deserved. Leith (Melb.)
kicked four splendid goals.
Port Melb. beat Fitzroy 5 to 3, and Carlton
scored similarly against St. Hilda.
Williamstown and Footsoray, after a rough
game, ended in a disgraceful riot. None of the players
attempted using the ball towards the finish, which con-
sisted of a series of more or less cowardly assaults. The
umpire removed the ball, stopped the game, and called in
the police. A decision will be given at the local police-
court during the week.
S. Melb. seem certain premiers for 1896.
* * * *
Itinerant photographers lose many money-
making chances by not patronising football. Pictures of
an angered crowd “ dealing it out ” to a mud-spattered
referee would sell well. Ditto reproductions of that lady
bashing an official during the interval at Melb. on Satur-
day. Also, negatives of an overjoyed barraeker kissing
the referee after a second-grade match in Sydney, a few
weeks back.
* * * *
Fifty to one in hundreds have been booked about
Broken Hill for Melb. Cup. The length of the odds
proves that the layer doesn’t believe in the alleged sound-
ness of Broken Hill’s leg, for on his Australian Cup win
the handsome S.A. stayer is one of the best-handicapped
horses in the race. But the backer must have credit for
knowing something.
* * * *
Prince of Wales, who ran third to Hear Hear
and Mourpa in A.R.C. Mayor’s Mile, should about win
S.A.J.C. Derby on Tuesday. Hear Hear, with 6st. 71b.,
cut out the mile in lmin. 44see., and paid a £22 16s. div.
Hurdle Race winner, Wirrana, paid a £21135. div.
Nature’s gaming-table at Rosehill provided an
exciting finish in August Handicap, Saturday, when the
dice-box of fortune rattled in favor of Bay Sal. It looked
a certainty for Royal Rose, but the mare got in by a
nostril and a-half, and the favorite lost the club’s £lOO
valentine. The way Erewhon finished suggested a likelv
win within a few weeks.
* * * •
Sydney’s champion chasers were once again
eclipsed by old Bushman, at Rosehill. Started for fun,
the repeatedly pensioned-off ancient landed a forlorn
hope, and few backers were any the richer.
* * * *
Banjo’s trip to Caulfield likely prejudiced his
chance in Adelaide G.N. Steeple. The Topsy horse Black
Flag shaped wretchedly. The owner of the winner, All
Fours, sold his nag before the race.
* * * *
Straightfire’s Flemington August Handicap win
under Bst. 101 b. puts a cheerful front on his Caulfield Cup
prospects. The crowd he met weren’t champions, but he
beat them. And with 241 b. less in October he has an
undeniable chance.
* * * *
Dalmeney and Destiny for the Epsom and
Metrop. double is now a much-fancied combination.
* * * *
The fixing of a maximum handicap weight by
the A. J.C. is a desirable innovation. The minimum should
have been shifted up a few pounds also. “ Fluttering”
handicaps are a delusion and a snare, and astute owners
soon realise the fact.
* * * »
Nevvhaven’s absence from Sydney Derby doesn’t
make the race much easier to pick. Coil, Tird, and Reka
are almost certain starters, and there is nothing to indi-
cate that one is better than either of the others, or that
the trio won’t go down before an outsider with no reputa-

A tale of two Nationals: The M.L. horses
Tiritea and Donald M ‘Kinnon entered and accepted for
both M.L. and Caulfield G.N. Hurdles and Steeple double.
Billed to leave Auckland for Sydney, they didn’t, and
punters rushed them for the “locals.” Leaving, osten-
sibly for Christchurch, they stopped at Wellington, and
every paper in the country published conflicting state-
ments about them daily for a fortnight. Then two boxes
were rigged up on an Australian-bound steamer. Mean-
while they were being supported in Sydney and Melb. for
Caulfield, one man laying £lO,OOO. At the beginning of
Caulfield week Sydney Telegraph printed a wire from
Melb. saying the prads had arrived there. Next day-
scratched. Now it transpires they never went to Melb. at
all, having gone to Maoriland G.N. meet from Wellington.
When this was known, horseites there went a raker on
Donald M'Kinnon for the steeple, drawing their salaries
in advance to back him. Final: On the day, the uncon-
sciously-humorous stable, quiet and dumb-like, won in-
stead with Mutiny, a son of Mute.
* * * »
Sydney’s equine elite are getting into stride for
the A.J.C. instead of trying on off Saturdays. The
Metrop. stake increase to £l5OO should induce more triers
than usual this year. Sydney substance and Victorian
shadow.

A novel billiard-match was played at a London
club recently. One player wore a suit of armour and ten
pairs of woollen gloves. The othey muffled his hands in
a pair of boxing gloves. The game was 1000 up, both
players starting at 980. The man with the “mittens”
won.

Scotch blood always tells in shooting competi-
tions, though the average Caledonian prefers a fixed
target to a Hying one, as a rule. Donald MTntosh, the
best of Victorian wing-shots, is in a fair way to be recog-
nised as the champion pigeon-potter of Europe. At Hur-
lingham international meeting he met a choice collection
of shooters, all going for the big money prizes, and his
“bag” amounted to £5B3 —a fact that speaks for itself.
Also the name of the latest “ Australian” hero speaks for
itself.

The Argus has been hoaxed once more, this
time by a veritable “ deeds that won the empire ” story
of a Homeric combat between a game-cock and a turkey
in the yard of the Melb. Detective Office. It all appeared
in large type, with the names of the party from whom the
turkey was stolen, and the detectives concerned, and
under special cross-headings. The Argus must have been
thinking of the days when the Duke of Edinburgh was in
Melbourne. At that time they did have cock-fights at the
Detective Office—in the" presence of H.R.H., and under
the auspices of the Police-commissioner himself.

One of the very best dressings for burns
is a compress soaked in fresh milk, renewed night
and morning.
Bandolph Bedford, in S.A. Chronicle,
puts in a good word for the much-abused Wes-
tralian Government:—
In Esperance I flud the first example in West Australia
of the desire to lean on the Government, and to be “agin
the Government ” if it refuses to act the leaning-post.
Three or four people arrive and make a settlement by
reason of the location being a goldfield, or a halting-place
on a goldfield’s track. On the track of the prospector
come the condenser man, and a gentleman who sells
summer drinks, or winter drinks for that matter, without
a license. Then come the regulation seller of malignant
intoxicants, and the man who has been a draper on the
east coast, but who becomes here a mining manager and
advisory expert. When the township is three months old
a loquacious person generally a barber —arrives with a
floating capital of eighteenpenee or thereabouts. By the
time his residence on the field aggregates a fortnight, the
responsibility of his investments causes him t.o form him-
self into a progress committee, which airs its wonderful
ignorance of the equalisation of finance by memorial-
ising the Government for an expenditure of £30,000 or
so on roads —the revenue of the settlement being £lOOO
or less a year. The native “ Westralians ” are now in the
position of the Boers, who—all jingo whooping being
beside the question—have a lot of justice on their side.
The floating population are the Uitlanders, and thus the
Transvaal is repeated in Westralia, only in a more peace-
ful style. The Westralian says: “We have our interests
bound in our old agricultural settlements. You t’other-
siders improve our position by your presence, but if your
new goldfield settlements prove failures large Govern-
ment expenditure will recoil, not on you, who will go
back east, but on us who have to stay here where are our
living and our dead—stay here to face the music and foot
the bill.” Despite all the abuse that has been levelled at
the Government, the fact remains that it has kept an
almost equal step with the wonderfully swift march of the
new population, and that it builds railways quicker than
any other country in the world.

Ayer's Sarsaparilla
Mr. Charles Stephenson, a well-known
Railway Employe at Kalapoi, New
Zealand, writes:
“About ten years ago, while en-
gaged in shunting, my loot caught
between the rails, and my leg was
fractured below the knee. It healed
in time, but 1 have been troubled
ever since with swollen veins, and
have been obliged, at times, to wear
a bandage. About a year ago it be-
came much worse, and I feared I
should be obliged to give up my
work. A friend advised me to try
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. I did so, and
after taking four bottles the swell-
ing disappeared, and I have not
been troubled with it since.”

“ Oobdenism is on its defence.”—The
Foktnighty Review.
Sydney D.T. winds up a pathetic story of
a horse killed by a N.S.W. locomotive with the
emotional remark—“ He leaves a widow and
grown-up family.”
For a nice, large horror the experience of
the assistant man-butcher at a recent Newgate
(Eng.) execution would be hard to beat. When
the bolt was drawn the Crown Law officer did not
step back asjyromptly as he should have done, and
so fell through the trap into the pit; to save him-
self he clutched hold of the legs of the patient
and hung on like grim death.
The English companies must look to their
laurels. The North German Lloyd Co. will have
on the, Aus ralian line at the end of the year two
magnificent mailboats of Atlantic-liner speed-
each of 11,000 tons and 20,000 tons displacement,
and double-engined with triple-expansion engines
of 7000 h.p. These boats are to be fitted with
gorgeous passenger accommodation and all modern
comforts for tropical travel, including the most
luxurious forms of baths.
Liebknecht, leader of the German Social-
ists, writes of his recent lecturing visit to Eng-
land :—“For the first time since the downbreak
of the Chartist movement the masses of the Eng-
lish workingmen are stirring to fight in their own
cause. . . . I looked for Jingoism in England, and
I did not find it among the working classes. It is
in England, as it is in Germany, France, and
other countries, Jingoism or Chauvinism is the
invention and monopoly of the capitalistic classes,
whose interest it is to keep the working classes,
and to perpetuate international discord —the last
hope of capitalism.” But Bulletin experience
doesn’t tally with this. You may judge the Eng-
lishman at Home by the Englishman abroad — and
can’t the latter crawl !
While the sour Sabbatarians of other folds
are mouthing woes upon Narrabri (N.S.W.) foot-
ballers, and the like, the local R.C, priest sanctions
such arid other Sunday recreations, provided that
religious “duties” are not neglected. His
reverence specially mentions fishing, dancing,
bowling, and the making of wedding garments !
Shure, in good ould Oireland, it did be the Sunday
fashion, after Mass, for the bhoys and the colleens
to meet on the village-grane and dance forninst
aich other, each blioy, be the same token, giving
the fiddler a penny. If there was no fiddler, one
of the colleens would “ lal-lal, lal-lal-3al-la ” the
chune ! And even in dissenting areas of England,
the writer has seen the village youths “tussling”
(wrestling) on the grassed spaces on Sunday after-
noons.

A German savant, Seiiion of Jena, from a
study of Australian anthropology has just pub-
lished some interesting conclusions. Australian
blacks are ranked in culture-grade above the
Veddas of Ceylon, about equal to the Fuegians of
Patagonia, slightly lower than the Pigmies and
Bushmen of Africa, the aboriginal Brazilians of
S. America, and the Eskimos. The Australians and
Dravidians of India belong to the same main stem,
which sprang from a root including races like the
Ceylonese Veddas, the Japanese Ainus, and the
Khmers and Chains of Cambodia. The white or
Caucasian race, being of Dravidian descent (or
ascent), are thus more nearly related to the low
wild Australian black than to the higher Mongols,
Malays, or negroes. So the Queensland squatter
is more nearly related to his “ black boy ” than to
his Chinese or Javanese cook.

To Herr Rassmussen,
Proprietor of the Alfaline Remedies.
Dear Sir, —It gives me great pleasure to inform
you that I have derived great benefit from your
celebrated Alfaline Remedies during my explor-
ing expeditions throughout Australia, and I con-
sider them invaluable to all travellers in the bush.
—Yours very truly, B. BUTTON,
(Formerly a Councillor, Brighton, England).
Witness : A. F. Beker, Manager, Grand Hotel,

Mr. Button writes later: —“ The Pills I had
from you were of great benefit to me and others.
In one case, when three hunters and trappers
were travelling about the ranges near my place on
the Rose River, one was taken very ill ; his mates
intended taking him in a waggon to Wangaratta
(about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor. I
gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to
inform you that having to pass their camp next
day, I found him up and pegging-out his skins
and looking well. This speaks volumes for your
valuable Remedies.”
A Lady’s Wish. Fulfilled.
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform
you that your celebrated Alfaline Universal Pills
cured me, when all other remedies and doctors
failed, of a stubborn case of Debility of 18 years’
standing. My wish is fulfilled at last, and I don’t
know how to thank you enough. Dear Sir, I
shall recommend your Alfaline Remedies to all
sufferers I come across. You are quite at liberty

monial, and anyone writing to me will have full

To Heer Rassmussen,
I am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline
Lock Cure Pills completely cured me of a very
bad disease. Previous to taking your Lock Pills,
I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better; and I shall
never regret trying your Alfaline Pills, as they
had a wonderful effect on my complaint, which
several of my work-mates can testify to. I have
recommended your Alfaline Herbal Remedies to
several of my friends, who have reason to be very
grateful for it, and I shall always do my best to
recommend them to any fellow sufferers. You

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 18711 was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Eriday I took the first of
your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

without success several of the leading doctors

I am now completely cured, and I shall be most

The MEMORANDUM of ASSOCIATION provides —
*\ The Corporation is hereby precluded from investing in, or holding any portion of its Capital in
securities which have not at the date of investment a recognised market value, and which have not at
the date of acquisition paid dividends or interest to the holders regularly during the two years imme-
diately preceding (Government securities and priorities over dividend-paying companies excepted);
and no portion of its Capital may be invested in Mining Companies’ Shares.” It cannot, therefore,
participate in the formation of any new undertaking.
“ The Corporation is precluded from investing in or holding any portion of its Capital in securities
upon which the liability is unlimited.” ...
“ The Corporation is precluded from raising money upon Mortgage, receiving deposits at interest,
or issuing Capital having any priority whatever.”
PROSPECTUS.
THE purpose of the AUSTRALASIAN SECURITIES INVESTMENT CORPORATION,
Limited (which will be virtually a co-operation between shareholders in existing well-established
companies), is to satisfy one of the greatest wants of these colonies —a channel for investment in safe
and convertible securities which give adequate promise of a reasonable return, with a minimum of risk
and liability. Many classes of the community have neither the opportunity nor the experience to
enable them to properly gauge the value of the securities which the markets offer, and a Corporation
such as this affords scope for spreading capital over a great variety of investments throughout Aus-
tralasia, which private individuals with small means and little experience cannot hope to accomplish.
It is generally acknowledged that the financial institutions of Australasia will not be able to pay
the same rates of interest on deposits that have ruled in the past, and that mortgage-interest will be
correspondingly reduced ; and it is recognised that, though such rates may fluctuate, they must be
permanently on a lower basis than heretofore. These Colonies are being brought into closer connection
with the Old World, and financial conditions must consequently assimilate more nearly than they have
hitherto done.
There are over one hundred securities quoted upon the various Australasian Stock Exchanges,
which, during the crises, and since, have continued to pay steady and, in many instances, large divi-
dends. Although separately they are subject to the risks of individual management and to competi-
tion, it is considered that, taken collectively, they afford as substantial and profitable a mass of invest-
ment, combined with safety, as can be found in any country in the world.
THE AUSTRALASIAN SECURITIES INVESTMENT CORPORATION, Limited, is
founded on the principle of Mutual Insurance, and is restricted from investing more than 10 per cent,
of its capital as a maximum in any one of those existing securities, .this maximum being reduced as
further issues of capital are made until it ultimately reaches 6 per cent. But its purpose is to hold
permanently only comparatively small amounts in the capitals of as many of these steadily dividend-
paying undertakings as possible. The shares of the Corporation will therefore, it is believed, constitute
a security fulfilling the following essentials of a desirable, safe investment of the highest standing :
1. The utmost security of the principal.
2. A constant rate of interest above that now obtainable upon Government stock, bank deposits,
or high-class mortgages.
3. Absence of speculation.
4. Recognised and ready marketability, subject to a minimum of fluctuation in price.
5. No personal liability on the part of the investor after payment of his shares in full.
6. The prospect of a gradual increase in principal.
7. An absence of the risks attaching to particular industries, and individual management.
8. Possessing a capital based wholly upon long-established joint stock enterprise in all parts of
these colonies, and which it is believed cannot default short of an entire collapse in the
solvency of Australasia.
The maximum dividend payable by the Corporation is limited to 5 per cent, per annum, until the
whole authorised Capital has been paid up, and it is proposed that all additional profits realised during
this process shall accumulate and be re-invested. It is further provided that such investment of addi-
tional profits, after a reserve fund of 20 per cent, upon the Capital of the Corporation has been accu-
mulated, may be distributed amongst the shareholders in the form of allotments of new shares in the
Corporation. Thus, it is anticipated that the shareholders’ principal will gradually be increased, and
with that increase the interest received upon the original investment will expand. This principle
embodies in some degree the benefits accruing under a participating life insurance policy, but such
participation will possess the lasting advantage of not terminating at the death of the original holder.
The Directors may, at their discretion, retain upon current account, or on temporary deposit, with
their bankers, such a sum as they may consider advisable in the interests of the Corporation.
The preliminary expenses (which are limited to the usual legal charges and brokerage) will be dis-
tributed over the first five years ; and the expenses of management will be exceptionally small. The
Directors will be virtually Trustees for the shareholders, and all dividends received from investments
will we paid direct to the bankers of the Corporation, where they will remain until distributed under
authority from the Board. The Corporation is precluded from conducting any business whatever out-
side the defined limits.
It is intended to apply for a quotation on the Sydney and Melbourne Stock Exchanges ; and the
Directors are empowered to make additional issue of shares, either in Australasia or in London,
provided always that a preponderating proportion of the capital shall be retained upon the Australasian
register or registers.
The Board reserves the right to declare the Corporation formed upon £lOO,OOO Capital being
subscribed.
Prospectus and Form 3 of Application can be obtained from the Brokers, Messrs. JONES and
BLACK, Bond-street, Sydney, or at the HEAD OFFICE AND BRANCHES OF THE BANK
OF NEW SOUTH WALES, the Bankers to the Corporation.

North Sydney, June 25, 1896,
Messrs. Fisher and Co.
Gentlemen, —I cannot speak too highly of your excellent
preparation of KOLA NUT. As a tonic, 1 found it .far
superior to anything of the kind I ever used, and have
strongly recommended it to several friends, all of whom
(after taking it) are enthusiastic in their praise of it. Kola
Nut Tonic has a most beneficial effect after an attack of.
INFLUENZA ; on some of my acquaintances it has pro-
duced wonderful effects, particularly in strengthening the ’
muscles of chest and limbs. Many of my cycling friends
swear by it. I notice its use has been adopted by the
Alpine Club as a STIMULANT and NUTRIENT in moun--
tain-climbing expeditions, &c., as it generally increases
the power of the LUNGS and keeps off muscular fatigue,
and will prove invaluable to athletes. 1 feel confident
Kola Nut Tonic will have a large consumption, for those
who once try it will always keep it in store.—Yours faith
fully,
CHARLES WISEHEART,
Willoughby.
NO CYCLIST SHOULD BE WITHOUT THIS REMARK-
ABLE INVIGORATOR, ESPECIALLY LADIES.
EVERY SINGER, AUCTIONEER, and PUBLIC
SPEAKER should take KOLA NUT TONIC.
A recent issue of the Planters’ Monthly contaiiis a
description of this remarkable nut and its uses :
“ Kola has the property of staying hunger, whilst sup-
porting the struggle for existence.
“ If a supply of nuts had been included in Mr. Stanley's
outfit his men would not have suffered so terribly for want
of animal food.
“ As might be expected, the value of Kola increases as
it makes its way into the interior of Africa, and some of
the tribes farthest removed from the sea pay for the drv
powder an equal weight of gold-dust.
“In a despatch from Mr. George Alexander Stevens,
Her Majesty’s Consul at Bahai, he calls attention to the
great powers of endurance in lifting heavy loads and
transporting them to long distances in the tropical
climate, attributed to the free use of Kola Bean. An old
African, after biting a piece of the magic Bean, lifted 179
English pounds weight on to his head and carried the
same for a distance of four miles.
“Still another merit is named, however, which will
interest the temperance party. The negros who chew
Kola Nut have no desire to drink rum, and hence save
money and retain their strength.”
A woman—whose'name under the circumstances cannot
be given—came into our shop the other day, with tears of
gratitude in her eyes, and said, “My husband used to
come home on Saturdays DRUNK, but he has been taking
Kola Nut Tonic for four weeks, and now conies home
quite SOBER and places the whole of his wages in my
hands. God bless you 1 ”

A Bulletin correspondent :
Archbishop Carr’s school reading-books will, it is con-
fidently asserted, be a pleasant surprise from the stand-
point of Australasian interest. Australasian Govern- i
ments have been criminally doltish in the matter of pro- j
viding suitable literature for their youngsters, and a
hope, perhaps too sanguine, of the Archbishops is that
the literary excellence of his little books and their philan- j
thropic and liberal sentiments will secure their adoption
by one or more of the Australasian Governments. Any-
how, these new books amount to a flank attack on the
secular State which, with loud trumpeting, ousted, the
churches from the education of the young, and then
went placidly asleep as regards their intellectual food. j
In Vic. Assembly, under the new standing
orders, a bill which has been left unfinished can be
taken up next session where it was left off, instead
of being laboriously started again at the beginning.
The only necessary formula is the following choice
piece of obscurity which is read by the clerk of
the House :
I certify that this Bill is identical with a Bill as last
agreed to by the Legislative Assembly which passed its
second reading in the last preceding session of this present
Parliament, but was not finally disposed of by both
Houses when the session closed.
This is the true legal method of trying to get
everything into one long, tangled sentence. What
the pompous person really wants to say is : “I
certify that a bill was introduced during the last
session of this Parliament. That bill was not
finally disposed of by both Houses when the said
session closed. That bill is this bill.” Much
clearer, much Shorter.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
* “ The average barmaid,” writes a British
enquirer into the subject, “prefers her lot to that
of a lady help, or nursery governess.” Here and
there a superior Hebe gets tired of being “ a sorb
of decoy,” but the others are glad to occupy a
position where they “do see life, anyway.” Bub
life, in the full sense of the term, is not revealed to
barmaids. Their knowledge of. female character in
private domestic circles is nil; the men they meet
every day are masqueraders more or less. Where
does Hebe gather her ideas and pick up food for
reflection ? From her “ best ” customers, her
friends, as she calls them— i.e., her most frequent
customers, pub. loungers, bookmakers, the ‘ * flash ”
types of commercial and professional men. She
naturally listens with more interest to the conver-
sation of matured drinkers than to the chatter of
young johnnies, for these, as she soon learns from
experience, are very likely going to the dogs,
if not to jail. Mankind, as she sees it, is divided
into tipplers who conduct themselves decently,
and tipplers who are lewd beasts, both classes
being more or less englamoured by an artificial
cheerfulness. She is .apt to pity a blear-eyed
“ waster ” instead of despising him. He pitches
fairy tales to her across the bar of some apocryphal
faithless girl or wicked wife, whose conduct drove
him to the bottle for consolation. Her fund of
sympathy is exhausted upon disreputable Dicks
and Charleys—she has none left for worthy things.
Hebe seldom cherishes any real respect, or affec-
tion, for her “mashes,” because she is bound to
fool them ; it is her business to fool them,' to con-
ceal other flirtations from therii, to be false in little
matters if not a Jezebel at heart, and therefore her
womanly disposition to think tenderly of an ad-
mirer is largely overruled by the feeling that her
admirer is a “juggins.” She knows or
next to nothing, of inen who don’t come at least
six times' a week to squeeze her hand and talk to
her with at least one glass of drink in them. Her
world is enveloped in a mist of whisky fumes, her
days are passed in promoting stupid dissipation,
her eyes rove from one familiar customer to
another, when not engaged in watching for some
special “ friend ” who has promised to come in at
that particular time. And she flatters herself
that she sees life. Poor, blind Hebe !

I AND OTHERS.
Increase your yields by Saving the Fine Gold
and Pyrites by the use of
Wynne and Trey art ha’s
Patent Battery Plates.
This Invention, lately patented, revolutionises the ordi-
nary battery treatment of ores, for by its use copper-
plates, quicksilver, and chemicals are entirely dispensed
with.- The Wynne and Tregurtha Patent Battery Plates
are made of iron, cast with peculiarly-shaped ribs. They
are fitted in a wooden frame, and take the place of the
ordinary copper-plates and blanket tables. The tailings
on leaving the stamper boxes pass over the plates which,
from their construction, catch the fine gold and pyrites,
allowing the sand and water to flow away. When the
plates are fully charged with the concentrates they are
then tilted backwards by means of a lever, throwing the
contents into a trough underneath. In practical use
much better results have been obtained by these plates
than by the ordinary copper ones, the yield of gold being
increased by fully 10 per cent. Excellent results have
been achieved in the treatment of refractory ores, where
the gold is associated with some foreign mineral, which
has proved deleterious to the mercury and causing the
loss of the gold. The plates are strong, simple in con-
struction, and easily handled, and can be obtained from

MELBOURNE-


According to Northern scientists, the rain-
fall at Enoggera reservoir (Brisbane) is evaporated
at the rate of a-quarter of an inch per diem. In
the interior of Australia an inch per day in
summer is about the average, and when one con-
siders that the yearly rainfall seldom exceeds (in
Western districts) lOin. or 12in., the awful signifi-
cance of the fact becomes strikingly apparent.
A. 0. Gregory tells how he once, while exploring,
left some hard india-rubber mugs on a table and
came back in a few hours to find a shapeless,
glutinous mass in place of the vessels. But then
a temperature of 118deg. will melt india-rubber,
and 125deg. in the shade is not uncommon in the
backblocks.
At the recent Melb. lecture on “Medical
Education,” a clergyman elicited a cheer from the
“ distinguished ” audience when he urged on doc-
tors that it was their duty to point out the im-
morality of keeping children at school for a long
stretch in the day-time and then piling weary
home-lessons on them at night. But when he was
logical enough (and manly enough) to refer to the
immorality of merchants compelling their tired
clerks to come back to the vitiated air of their
offices at night to save a few shillings, the “ dis-
tinguished” audience hissed and groaned in-
wardly, and was outwardly as demonstrative as a
block of ice.

Dear Bulletin, —Your correspondent who says
that the umpire-stoushing at N. Melb. will put another
nail in the coffin of Vic. football is all out. Read the
future in the history of the past; and you will find that
the popularity of the game is in direct ratio to the spirit,
ill-feeling, brutality, or whatever you like to call it, that
its players and barraokers exhibit. Melbourne and Ade-
laide football was at its highest in ’B7 to ’9l, and, during
that period, club partizanship was never at so high a
pitch. Practically all the young men and youths of all
classes in both cities wore the colors of their favored clubs
daily, a practice that led to many a free fight, not alone
at matches but during the week. When was excitement
higher than in the deciding Geelong v. South match of ’B7
at the S. Melb. ground, yet for three weeks prior it was
freely rumored and believed that the South barraokers
intended to drown the Geelong players in Albert Park
lagoon adjoining the ground. Scarcely a Saturday passed
then without some “ disgraceful scene ” on one of the
grounds; umpires had repeatedly to escape by the back
doors of the pavilions to avoid being mangled by the in-
furiated mobs in front; and fighting on the playing-ground
was an accessory of about every third match. Anybody
who witnessed any of the old-time contests of Fpotscray
and Williamstown, Richmond and North, St. Hilda and
Prahran, or South and Ports, and saw road-metal and
pieces of quartering used to lay out objectionable
opponents, will recognise the fallacy of the contention
alluded to. —Larrikin.
* * * *
The captain of a North Melb. junior football
organisation was giving evidence in an umpire-stoushing
appeal case before Judge Casey at Melb. Criminal Court.
Asked by the opposing barrister “ What did you do when
the final bell sounded ? ” he replied, “I ran towards the
umpire.” “ And why did you do that ? ” I wanted to get
his name ; he gave such unfair decisions.” One to the
captain. But the barrister was not beaten. “ Did you
see him struck ?” he persevered. “ Yass, I seen a bloke
stoush him.” “Then, did you run up to protect him?”
The. witness stiffened upright for a second, then his jaw
dropped and his eyes started from his head ; leaning his
head forward, he repeated slowly and with an expression
of scorn actors would give years of study to acquire :
“ Did-I-run-up-ter-pertect-’im ? Me run up ter pertect
’im?”—a pause—“No-o-o-o”—deliberately—“ I did not
run up ter pertect ’im.” Even the Court smiled at the
emphasis of the reply, and the lawyer, gathering himself
for a final attack, observed : “ I suppose you thought he
did not receive sufficient punishment?” “ Well, ’e could
er done with a trifle more.” The witness then stood
down.
* * * *
To realise the complete possibilities of football,
writes a Bulletin correspondent, one must see a junior
match. The other Saturday 1 had the pain of witnessing
the W. Melb. juniors pulverise Hawthorn. Up to half-
time the game was fairish, but thence on, “slinging,”
tripping, even “rabbiting” and “stoushing” were in
order. As one barracker near me said to his mate, there
was “plenty of jog to-day.” “Yes,” returned he, “they’re
makin’ it blanky willin’.” After three-quarter-time the
barraokers —mostly Hawthorn —decided to take a hand ;
and strolled on to the ground, got in the way of their
friends’ opponents, tripped them, and made things
generally “ very willin’.” The umpire was there in person,
but he might as well have been away. It was a notable
exlrhition of our “ glorious winter game.”

Two workmen employed in a Ohio (IJ.S.) cycle-
factory recently stole all the parts of a machine. At the
trial their lawyer showed that the entire value of the
stolen parts was under £3, and claimed that the co. which
sold the bike for £25 was the real thief. A discrimi-
nating jury admitted the logic and acquitted the
prisoners.

A severe blow is struck at English cycling by
the suspension of Michael, the 19-year-old Welsh laa,
pending enquiry into alleged cronk running in the recent
“ chain ” matches. If Michael be guilty, his offence is
ten times more heinous than that of the ordinary “dead”
cyclist or jockey. To receive a big sum from the Simpson
lever chain people to do his best for them and then
“turn dog” is an act repulsive to the most hardened
spieler. The state of cycling in France may be gauged
by the fact that the Parisian tracks decline to recognise
Miohael’s suspension, and still use him as a draw to their
meetings.

The Marylebone C.C., says a Sydney paper, is
one of the most exclusive clubs in the world. Yet
any first-class cricketer who travels as an amateur can
get elected a member of the M. 0.0. —Grace and Stoddy,
for instance, are not Personages in a sassiety way of
speaking. The Jockey Club is an exclusive affair, seeing
that some of the whitest and wealthiest of racing men
don’t stand a possible show of entering it.

A member of the Australian Eleven, writing to
an Adelaide friend, alleges that the memorable score of 18,
all out, against M.C.C. was not altogether due to the
wicket and Pougher and Hearne. The Australians had
visited London Tivoli the night previous. Usually veil-
behaved, they had a night out, and paid for it next day
on a bad wicket.

K. J. Key, capt. of the Surrey county eleven,

played.”

Dear Bulletin, —Your correspondent, signing
himself “Australian Blow,” who accuses The Bulletin of
a British bias in its cricket comments, seems to form his
conclusion from the fact that he knows of no other Aus-
tralian paper which isn’t biassed the other way. The
Bulletin, I take it, tries to counteract the general
tendency both of cricket cables and local reasonings
therefrom. There is always something to be said for the
unpopular side of the case, but Australian newspapers, in
general, are careful not to say it. They confine them-
selves to suggestions of what might have been if some-
thing different had happened to the advantage of Our
Boys, and never, by any chance, draw attention to the
misfortunes of the Englishmen, who must have their share
of bad luck sometimes. As regards the stupid Hinglish
excuse that test-matches are “sold” by the professional
players, it arises from the not infrequent evidence of pro-
fessionals’ indifference to “honor and glory” in minor
matches, where they are not under the observation of
their club authorities. For my part, I can swear that I’ve
heard many young Australians, as well as new-chums, say
of Stoddart’s last visiting team —“They could do what
they liked with our fellows,” though it was always ap-
parent that the visitors were trying their hardest in the
important games. Nevertheless, their last performance
in Melbourne—an extra match against Victoria, for some
benefit purpose—showed how badly the pros, can cut up
when they have no personal credit, or gate-money at
stake, and the captain happens to be ill. —Yours, British
Bombast.

Dr. Pat. Moloney, of Melbourne, lecturing on
sport, declares we are cricketers, “ because our tree-
climbing ancestors tossed the fruit to their young, who
gleefully caught it.” This should make us more lenient
in regard to the monkey-tricks of various players at ’Ome.

Mr. “ Johnny ” Deeble promised, at the start, to
rule the crooked Sydney trotting-owners with a rod of iron,
but he has hardly succeeded in carrying out his promise.
One stepper, “thrown in” week after week, runs a “bye”
without sign from the stewards. This ruins a race, as
owners, who might otherwise back their horse, stand off
for fear it may be that stepper’s day out.

The American papers talk seriously of the pros-
pect of sending over a trotter or pacer to beat the great
N.S.W. horse Fritz. A writer in the Horseman suggests
a horse named Klatmath, with a 2.8 J record, as likely to
do the trick. Fritz, on our courses, can trot a mile in at
least 2.10, which means that it is 1000 to 1 against a horse
who, on perfect American courses, can trot a mile in 2.8 J,
crossing the water and beating 2.10 in Australia. No
horse has ever trotted in Australia within any number of
seconds of his American record. Mr. Foster bought the
pacer J.H. at a big figure, on the understanding that he
did a certain trial, and he carried out the contract. But
when J.H. arrived in Australia his American record had
been left behind, and he never recovered it.
• » * *
M.L. trotting has a better chance of reaching a
higher plane now that dissenting associations have shaken
hands. Colonial Sec. Carroll has promised the sport a
fair share of tote permits. But cronkness must disappear
from all racing. Weak-kneed clubs will forfeit their right
to race. Mr. Carroll’s plan is to treat them like publicans:
black marks, extinction.
• * * *
M.L. ring’s petition to bet on courses contains
one fairly sound argument. Owners backing at fixed
odds would receive those odds. At present, if they in-
vested on the tote at, say, sixes and their horses touched
threes, they would receive threes. Which is quite true.
But clubs say the machine gives better odds all-round,
and quote occasional mammoth divs. The books say
they would probably re-invest some of their big corns, on
the tote ; the club would gain, and owners, having got a
fixed price, wouldn’t be prejudiced. This, of course,
would favor owners, who could also play up on the nod.
One big club does license its local men, but the writer has
never seen their odds quoted alongside the tote’s in race-
reports.
* * • *
It is to be hoped the intended efforts of A. J.C.
committee to achieve the tote will prove successful.
Prevailing influences have reduced racing to a mere
open-robbery pastime ; the abolition of the noisy horde of
bookies, alleged bookies, swindlers, and hangers-on -would
be a public relief. The automatic layer doesn’t knowingly
fatten on “ stiffs,” nor does it lay scratches, or horses not
on the ground. Also, owners would benefit by added
values, and the public wouldn’t miss a small tax on their
pleasure for charities. As the gilded crowd will button-
hole vigorously in anticipation of the special meeting to
discuss machine legislation, members are hereby asked to
ponder upon the certainty of Sydney Cup being raised to
greater value than Melb. Cup in a few years ; of the estab-
lishment of a big winter National; of increased values all
round, encouraging outside competition and public pat-
ronage, and of the attainment of a higher standard of
turf morality than at present exists—or doesn’t exist.
» * * *
If the controlling powers are sincere in their
desire to restrict racing in the metropolitan area, the
legalisation of the tote would afford them opportunity.
The limitation of permits, and the interdiction of clubs
not getting them, would curb the evil right away. The
all-too-numerous shandygaff meetings got off on suburban
run-rounds weekly are quite unnecessary. They are
steeped in cronkness, and the proprietaries line their
pockets instead of improving their tracks and appurten-
ances.
* * * *
The odds fraternity are said to be quite within
their rights fielding against dead ’uns or non-starters.
The public trust to newspaper information re the lattei,
and fall in badly. At least six horses mentioned weekly
in Cup quotations aren’t in training and won’t be trained.
Yet all have been alluded to in rosy language, and
marked “dangerous,” especially in the allegedly well-
informed sporting papers which don’t seem to trouble
about private enquiries. Ikey Mo is a trifle more careful.
He knows when the “ handsome, well-bred full brother to
So-and-so ” is scampering about the paddock, and lays
accordingly.

Mr. Chaffey Baker, chairman of S.A.J.C., says
the totalisator has made his club “ the most successful
and prosperous jockey club in Australia.”
The multiplicity of readied-up pony “ pots ”
lately has caused much relief to bookies’ cash-bags. One
badly-stricken penciller asked a steward recently why
some of these inconsistent beauties weren’t brought to
grass. No one yells louder for “straight racing” than
the gent heavily hit by a “ waiter.” “ The expected hap-
pened at last,” said one of the papers the other day,
alluding to a long-deferred win. It happened in a big
field of well-backed ’uns, and the ring did not expect it
until the last moment, when money came at them all
roads, and was poured into every shop in the city.

Member Crick’s proposed N.S.W. <£lo stallion-
tax is badly required. The country is overrun with scrub-
bers allowed to perpetuate their species. The £3 tax on
racers is something new, but churchy Ms.P. may support
it on principle. Some of them would tax stakes offered
by clubs for competition, if they got a chance.

Crick, M.P., once had a betting-case before a
certain judge, whose ignorance of sporting matters was
as apparent as his desire not to appear ignorant of them.
It was a law-suit over the payment of a double, and a
sporting witness was asked—“ Did the first horse win ? ”
when the judge interposed and exclaimed, testily, “Now,
Mr. Crick, do you think I am so ignorant as not to know
that the first horse always wins ? ” Later on the witness
was asked—“ Did the second horse win?” (meaning the
second race, of course.) The judge said, “ Sir, do you
suppose I’m such a fool as not to know that the second
horse cannot win a race? Of course your answer is
obvious, witness. Did the second horse win?" “No,
yer honor,” replied the witness ; “he was dead 1 ”
“ Dead,” said the judge, “ how could a dead horse run a
race? What do you mean?” “I mean he was ‘stiff,’”
said the witness. Whereupon the judge looked fierce,
threatened the witness with contempt of court, and bade
him stand down, talking nonsense about dead and stiff
horses running in races.

A prize-winner at the recent Olympic Games
writes that the fame of young Flack’s athletic perform-
ances having preceded him to Athens, the committee of
the games became fearful of the chance of a Greek pulling
off the race from Marathon. Accordingly, they worked
the oracle in a fashion that would have done credit to an
Australian pony-stable. Entries for the great race closed
for Greeks a fortnight before the meeting, and a trial race
had been run under the direction of the authorities of the
sports to select the most likely local men. In order to
“dish” the foreign competitors, the committee ordered
another trial race to be run and sent up several more
competitors, one of whom ultimately proved successful in
the race itself. Post-entries for this second body were
accepted, in distinct violation of the advertised conditions.
Under these circumstances, it is a wonder that Australian
Flack, or the Americans, got a show at all.


A Sydney Sunday paper publishes a story
“ Starved to Death ! What it Feels Like—by
One Who Knows. ”
Goldsbrough, Mort and 00. gave five
guineas for the fleece of the 1600-guinea ram Pre-
sident. It weighed 221 b., and is for exhibition.
At Inglewood (Vic.) the other day an old
fellow of 03 brought his grey hairs in sorrow to the
grave by deliberately blowing the top of his skull
off with a gun.
A Melbourne unemployed went into the
Russell-street police barracks and shot himself dead
the other evening. It seemed that the poor fellow
was anxious to give as little trouble as possible.
He took with him enough money to pay funeral
expenses, aiid remembering that the police would
have to convey his body to the morgue, he left it
with the police, to spare anyone the job of going
to fetch it.
A remarkable statement appears in a
privately-printed pamphlet just issued in Eng-
land, by Canon Jenkins, Lyminge, who corres-
ponded for many years with Cardinal Manning.
The cannon, in conversation with Manning after
the latter’s elevation to the cardinalate, referred
to the iniquity of the Papacy of the Renaissance
period, such as the doings of the Borgia, the
Ghisleri, and the Pamphli Papacies. The Car-
dinal seemed in complete ignorance of these chap-
ters of history, and heard of them not only with
horror but terror. He said to his Anglican friend :
“ My only comfort is that I believe in the Holy
Catholic Church. ” To which his friend replied :
“ But what if it is not holy ? ”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Supper was over at Shingle Hut and we
Were all seated round the tire —all except Joe. He
was mousing. He stood on the sofa with one ear
to the wall in a listening attitude and brandished
a table-fork. There were mice—mobs of them—
between the slabs and the paper layers of news-
papers that had been pasted one on the other at
periods ranging over ten years until they were an
inch thick ; and whenever Joe located a mouse he
drove the fork into the wall and pinioned it—or
reckoned he did.
Dad sat pensively at one corner of the fire-place
- Dave at the other with his elbows on his knees
and his chin resting in his palms.
“Think could you ride a race, Dave?” asked
Dad.
“Yairs,” answered Dave, without taking his
eyes off the fire, or his chin from his hands—
“'could, I suppose, if I’d a pair o lighter boots ’n
these.”
Again they reflected.
Joe triumphantly held up the mutilated form of
a murdered mouse and invited the household to
“ look.” No one heeded him.
“ Would your mother’s go on you ? ”
“ Might,” and Dave expectorated into the
fire.
“ Anyway,” Dad went on, * we must have a go
at this handicap with the old mare ; it’s worth
trying for, and, believe me, now, she’ll surprise a
few of their flash hacks, will Bess.”
“ Yairs, she can go all right.” And Dave spat
again into the fire.
“ Go / I’ve never known anything to keep with
her. Why, bless my soul, seventeen years ago,
when old Redwood owned her, there wasn’t a
horse in the district could come within cooee of
her. AJI she wants is a few feeds of corn and a
galiop or two, and mark my word she’ll show some
of them the way.”
* - * » *
Some horse-races were being promoted by
the shanty-keeper at the Overhaul—seven miles from
our selection. They were the first of the kind held
in the district, and the stake for the principal event
was =65. It wasn’t because Dad was a racing
man or subject to turf hallucinations in any way
that he thought of preparing Bess for the meet-
ing. We sadly needed those five pounds, and, as
Dad put it, if the mare could only win it would
be an easier and much quicker way of making a
bit of money than waiting for a crop to grow.
* * * *
Bess was hobbled and put into a two-acre
paddock near the house. We put her there be-
cause of tier wisdom. She was a chestnut, full ot
villainy, an absolutely incorrigible old rogue. If,
at any time, she was wanted when m the grass
paddock, it required the lot of us from Dad down
to yard her, as well as the dogs, and every other
do * - in the neighborhood. Not that she had any
brumby element in her—she would have been
pasier to yard if she had but she would drive
Steadily enough, alone or with other horses, until
she saw the yard, when she would turn and deli-
berately walk away. If we walked to head her
she beat us by half a length ; if we ran she ran,
and stopped when we stopped. I hat was the
aggravating part of her ! When it was only to go
to the store or the post-office that we required her,
we could have walked there and back a dozen'
times ere we could have run her down, but; some-
how, we generally preferred to labor in catching
her rather than walk.
When we had spent half the day hunting for
the curry-comb, which we didn’t find, Dad began
to rub Bess down with a corn-cob--a shelled one —
and trim her up a bit. He pulled her tail and cut
the hair off her heels with a knife ; then he gave
her some corn to eat, and told J oe he was to have
a bundle of thistles cut for her every night. Now
and again, while grooming her, Dad would step
back a few paces and look upon her with pride in
his eye.
“ There’s great breeding in the old mare,” he
would say —“ great breeding ; look at the shoulder
on her, and the loin she has ; and where did ever
you before see a horse with the same nostril ? Be-
lieve me, she’ll surprise a few of them.”
We began to regard Bess with profound respect;
hitherto we had been accustomed to pelt her
with potatoes and blue-metal.
The only thing likely to prejudice her chance in
the race, Dad reckoned, was a small sore on her
back about the size of a foal’s foot. She had had
that sore for upwards of ten years to our know-
ledge, but Dad hoped to have it cured before the
race came off with a never-failing remedy he had
discovered —burnt-leather and fat.
* * * *
Every day, along with Dad, we would
stand on the fence near the house to watch Dave
gallop Bess from the bottom of the lane to the
barn—about a mile. We could always see him
start, but immediately after he would disappear
down a big gully and we would see nothing more
of the gallop till he came within a hundred yards
of us. And wouldn’t Bess bend to it once she got
up the hill and fly past with Dave in thfe stirrups
watching her shadow ! —when there was one : she
was a little too fine to throw a shadow always.
And when Dave and Bess had got back and Joe
had led her round the yard a few times, Dad
would rub the corn-cob over her again and apply
more burnt-leather and fat to her back.
* * * *
On the morning preceding the race Dad
decided to send Bess over three miles to improve
her wind. Dave took her to the crossing at the
creek—supposed to be three miles from Shingle
Hut, but it might have been four or it might' have
been five, and there was a stony ridge on the way.
We mounted the fence and waited. Tommy
Wilkie came along riding a plough-horse. He
waited too.
“ Ought to be coming now,” Dad observed, and
Wilkie got excited. He said he would go and
wait in the gully and race Dave home. “ Race
him home ! ” Dad chuckled, as Tommy cantered
off, “ he’ll never see the way Bess goes.” Then
we all laughed.
Just as someone cried “Here he is !” Dave
turned the corner into the lane, and Joe fell off
the fence and pulled Dad with him. Dad damned
him and scrambled up again as fast as he could.
After a while longer Tommy Wilkie hove in sight
’midst a cloud of dust. Then came Dave, scarcely
faster than a trot, and flogging all he knew with a
piece of greenhide plough-rein. Bess was all-out
and floundering. There was about two hundred
yards yet to cover. Dave kept at her—thud !
thud ! Slower and slower she came. “Damn the
fellow ! ” Dad said ; “ what’s he beating her for?”
“ Stop it, you fool! ” he shouted. But Dave sat
down on her for the final effort and applied the
hide faster and faster. Dad crunched his teeth.
Once—twice—three times Bess changed her stride;
• then struck a branch root of a tree that projected
a few inches above ground, and over she went —
crash ! Dave, fell on his head and lay spread out,
motionless. We picked him up and carried him,
inside at once, and whevi mother saw blood on him
she fainted straight off without first waiting to
know if it were his own or not. Both looked as
good as dead, hut Dad, with a bucket of water, ;
soon brought them round again,
* * * *
It was scarcely dawn when we began pre-
paring for a start to the races. Dave, after
spending fully an hour trying in vain to pull on
mother’s elastic-side boots, decided to ride m Ins
own heavy bluchers. We went with Dad in the
dray. Mother wouldn’t go ; she said she didn’t
want to see her son get killed, and warned Dad
that if anything happened the blame would for
ever be on his head. .
We arrived at the Overhaul in good time. Dad
took the horse out of the dray and tied him to a
tree. Dave led Bess about, and we stood and
watched the shanty-keeper unpacking gingerbeer.
Joe asked Dad for sixpence to buy some, but Dad
hadn’t any small change. We remained there,
though (in front of the booth), most of the day,
and ran after any corks that popped out and
handed them in again to the shanty-keeper. He
didn’t offer us anything—not a thing !
“ Saddle up for the Overhaul Handicap ” was at
last sung out, and Dad, saddle on arm, advanced
to where Dave was walking Bess about. They
saddled up and Dave mounted, looking as pale as
death.
“I don’t like ridin’ in these boots a bit, he
said, with a quiver in his voice.
“ Wot’s up with ’em ? ” Dad asked.
“ They’re too big altogether.”
“Well, take ’em off, then ! ”
Dave jumped down and pulled them off—leav-
ing his socks on.
More than a dozen horses went out, and when
th.e starter said “ Off ” didn’t they go ! Our eyes
at once followed Bess. Dave was at her right
from the jump, the very contrary to what Dad
had told him. In the first furlong she put fully
20 yards of daylight between herself and the field
—she came after the field. At the back of the
course you could see the . whole of Kyle’s selection
and two of Jerry Keefe’s haystacks between her
and the others. We didn’t follow her any further.
After the race was won and they had cheered
the winner, Dad wasn’t to be found anywhere.
Dave sat on the grass quite exhausted. “Ain’t
y’ goin’ to pull the saddle off ? ” Joe asked.
“No,” be said; “I ain’t. You don’t want
everyone to see her back, do you ? ”
Joe wished he had sixpence.
* * * *
About an hour afterwards Dad came stag-
gering along arm-in-arm with another man—an
old fencing-mate of his, so he made out.
“Thur yai,” he said, taking off his hat and
striking Bess on the rump with it; “ besh bred
mare in the worl’.”
The fencing-mate looked at her, but didn’t say
anything ; he couldn’t.
“Eh?” Dad went on; “say sh’ain’t? L’ere —
every’ name is—betcher pound sh’is.”
Then a jeering and laughing crowd gathered
round, and Dave wished he hadn’t come to the
races.
“ She ain’t well,” said a tall man to Dad—
“short in her gallops.” Then a short, bulky indi-
vidual without whiskers shoved his face up into
Dad’s and asked him if Bess was a mare or a cow.
Dad became excited, and only that old Andei 1 -
son came forward and took him away there must
have been a row.
Anderson put him in the dray and drove it
home to Shingle Hut.
* * * *
Dad reckons now that there is nothing in
horse-racing, and declares it a fraud. He says,
further, that an honest man, by training and
racing a horse, is only helping to feed and fatten
the rogues and vagabonds that live on the sport.
