Winston
One of the chief historical services tha
Winston Churchill’s The World Crisis (Au
tralasian Publishing Co.) performs is t
establish, so far as such a matter can
established, the moral responsibility for th
war. Britain certainly did not want i
The Government was Liberal; most of it
members were Little-Englanders; and th
bulk of the people had almost lost the capf
city to think of war except in terms of pun
tive expeditions. Sir Edward Grey (Foreig
Secretary) struggled desperately to avert tl
menace on practical lines which must ha\
appealed to anyone who wanted it averted.
To get the Groat Powers together round a tab
in any capital that was agreeable, with Brita
there to struggle lor peace, and if necessary
threaten war against those who broke it, was h
plan. Had such a conference taken place the
would have been no war. Merc acceptance of tl
principle of a conference by the Central Powe
would have instantly relieved the tension. A wil
to peace at Berlin and Vienna would have found
difficulties in escaping from the terrible net wide
was drawing in upon us all hour by hour.
France, which knew the relative strength (
the French and German armies, was moi
than reluctant. There was none of the sell
assurance of 1870: that had all been trails
ferred to the other side of the Rhine.
Justice to France requires the explicit statemen
that the conduct of her Government at this awfu
juncture was faultless. She assented instantly
every proposal that could make for peace. SI
abstained from every form of provocative aetioi
She even compromised her own safety, holding bac
her covering troops at a considerable distance behinc
her frontier, and delaying ■ her mobilisation in ti
face of continually gathering German forces tid ti
latest moment. Not until she was confronted wit
the direct demand of Germany to break her Treat
and abandon Russia did France take up the cha
lenge; and even had she acceded to the Genoa
demand she would only, as we now know, have bee
faced with a further ultimatum to surrender to Ger
man military occupation, as a guarantee for lie
neutrality, the fortresses of Toul and Verdun. Tliei
Was never any chance of France being allowed t
escape the ordeal. The German military chief
btimed to give the signal, and were sure of th
result. She would have begged for mercy in vain.
In the last resort it is not Cabinets o
military chiefs who make great wars, but th
people. The French and British people wer
in hand, and eager for peace, when Britain’
naval preparations began on July 27. Some
thing might have been done two days late
when the First Fleet left for its Wa
Station. But by the 30tli the strategi
concentration of the R.N. had been com
pletcd: in Churchill’s exultant phrase, “The
King’s .ships were at sea.” The Frencl
saw what that signified rather more clearly
than the British —that France had the R.N
behind her, and hence, in the long run, shoulc
win. On the 31st, as we now know, the
Russian Ambassador in Paris sent the tele-
gram to his Government which emphasise!
that the time for negotiations had passed,
that France was ready to fight, and that
Russia must mobilise. Intent is the basis
of every crime, and, so far as the events of
July, 1914, were concerned, intent dearly
originated in Germany. Long before France
had decided to fight, any German statesman
of pacifist leanings would have been in dan-
ger at the hands of the Berlin mob.
Churchill claims to have discovered
Beatty. The Admiral had been unemployed
for IS months, and was out of favor at the
Admiralty when Churchill made him his Naval
Secretary. To understand this strange
First Lord’s enthusiasm over his find it
has to be remembered that Churchill is still
as keen on soldiering, polo and hunting
as when lie joined a cavalry regiment over
quarter of a century ago. He admired
Beatty because he was more like a cavalry
officer than a sailor: —
He had seen a lot of fighting on land with the
army, and he came of hard-riding stock; his fathei
had been in my own regiment, the 4th Hussars, anc
I had often heard him talked of when I first joined.
The Admiral I knew was a very fine horseman, with
.what is called “an eye for country.”... .His mind
had been rendered quick and supple by the situations
'of/ polo and the hunting-field, and enriched by
' various experiences against the enemy on Nile gun-
boats and ashore.
j'lt is doubtful if the methods of the cavalry
officer are desirable, on the whole, in one
who has the handling of great affairs. Most
of Churchill’s own failures, from Sidney-
street to Antwerp and Gallipoli, may be
traced to his cavalry training and tempera-
ment. He has a love of danger for its own
sake. Faced with the choiefe between stav-
ing safely at home, where his job is, and
crossing to France to have a look at the
state of a front line, he usually chooses the
latter. He believes in putting issues to a
touch —in standing to win or lose all on a
isingle dashing move. This trait is notice-
able in almost every page of his book, and
it is revealed also in the men he specially
marks out for approbation. His idol is Lord
Fisher, whose delight when told that the
fleet had been mobilised (in other words, that
the odds were ten to one on war with Ger-
many) “was wonderful to see.”
In' “The World Crisis” Churchill shows
himself to be an even greater literary artist
than he appeared in his “Lord Randolph
Churchill.” The style is as eager and glow-
ing, and the balance of the whole book as
masterly, while controversial problems are
approached from a less didactic angle, even
where they happen to be problems which
concern liis own reputation. He should be
remembered as a brilliant interpreter of the
life and history of his period long after his
political record is forgotten.

Where the War Poets Stand To-day
When the war broke out some of us
who are writing to-day had not read much
that we had chosen for ourselves. And so
when, within the next two years, the maga-
zines began to be crowded with wonderful,
exuberant, tragic young poetry, we thought
we were in a new r world. We found Rupert.
Brooke, and let our thirsty young tongues
ripple over the cadences of “The Chilterns”
—-““I shad desire.and I shall find the of
my desires.” Then we read what Wilfrid
Gibson wrote about him—
T''e sreldpn head goes down into the night
Quenched in cold gloom
—and our young hearts broke. There were
other gods as well —the supreme boyishness
of C. H. Sorley. who “swung ungirded hips”
for a brief moment; the plaintive songs of
the Irishman Francis Ledwidge ; the sonorous
songs of Masefield ; and many, another.
But that was nine years ago; we have
had many books since then, and it behoves
us to set our shelves in order. So we look
through them to see who is worthy to go back
permanently. Rupert Brooke, John Freeman,
Lawrence Binyon, Francis Ledwidge, John
Masefield, Thomas Hardy, W. W. Gibson,
John Drinkwater, Wilfred Owen, C. E
Sorley, Robert Nichols, Siegfried Sassooi
Wyndham Tennant, Leon Gellert, Alan Seegei
Joyce Kilmer—one sorrows to find that fe\
of them have stood the test of the years
Each volume has, perhaps, a poem or tw
that is notable; but other books have
great light shining on almost every pag<
The greatest virtue of the war poetry wa
its spontaneity—the fact thiat it seemcc
to force its way out of the hearts of lads
many of whom had hardly written a lin
before. All such poetry must be at leas
reasonably good poetry; and the poets 01
my shelves are all a great deal more thai
reasonably good poets. They are all of thei
fine, true and beautiful; some of them onl
lack the universality of appeal to mak
them eternal. They sufficed adequately
during the war years, when nations wcr
living on their emotions. But norma
times demand more. They demand that th
intellect, as well as the emotions, shall b
satisfied.
The war poets fall, roughly, into thre
divisions. There were, first of all, tin
men whose sole impulse to poetry was th
war and its stupendous significance to them
next, the accepted poets, who regarded th
war as they would any other great national
convulsion, recording their emotions faith
fully; finally, those men who were already
skilled literary craftsmen, if not acceptec
poets, who found in the war a wonderfu
mine of new material. Although Ruper
Brooke was already a poet of some standing
in 1914, he must be regarded as the perfec
representative of the first class; lie was th<
spirit incarnate of young England. He ha<
beauty of body and of mind, the divine spirt
of youth, his poetry was wide in its appea
—and he was killed. That sufficed to give
a man the name of genius in the early days
of the war; and there is no doubt tha
Brooke was sometimes great, notably in
“The Soldier” and “These Dead.” But the
war brought forth so many flashes of genius
that one cannot endow any man with immor
tality who was not .more than occasionally
great. Much of his work, including oui
beloved “Ckilterns,” was nothing more than
charming and original. It still warms tin
heart to read him, but the time that gave
his cry its special poignancy is gone. Julian
Grenfell was great and warm-blooded in
( one poem, “Into Battle.” There is infinite
' tenderness in the last stanza of Wyndhan
Tennant’s “Elome Thoughts'in Laventie”—
Hungry for Spring I bent my head ;
The perfume fanned my face,
And all my soul was dancing- in that lovely little
place,
Dancing with a measured step from wrecked am’
shattered towns,
A way.... upon the Downs.
These men found in the war the great adven-
ture, and looked with dazzled eyes on the
sun of new-found emotion.
In the second class, of established poets,
notable work was done by John Masefield,
Thomas Hardy, Ed ward~Thomas (though he
had done most of his previous work in
prose) and Sir Henry Newbolt, whose poem
“The Vigil” was the finest p : ece of purely
patriotic verse that was produced. Dr.
Robert Bridges was unhappy in the new*
medium, and Rudyard Kipling produced very
little of worth. This class did excellent
work, because it included great artists under
the wh ; p of a new and a powerful emotion.
But there was a certain acceptance of
conditions in their work which robbed it of
the keen poignancy possessed by the younger
men.
One poet standing apart from the others
has been too often missed —Wilfred Owen.
'He was purely a poet of the war, and the
war in its grimmest aspect. But his work
had a greatness of conception and a terrible
beauty that lifted it far beyond the frail
songs of the other young men. Hear a
stanza of his “Anthem for Doomed Youth,”
that sonorous title for a really great poem:
What candles shall be held to speed them all?
Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes,
Shall shine the holy glimmers of good-bves,
The pallor of girls’ brows shall be their pall,
Their flower the tenderness of patient minds,
And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.
This is not vers dc semaine ; it has all the
ingredients of the great classic poems—
beauty the more outstanding for its strange-
ness, tragedy, grim irony and an appeal that
is eternal. He is equally strong, too, in
“Greater Love”:—
Red lips are not so red
As the stained stones kissed by the English dead.
In the men of the third class are to be
found the salvation of English poetry to-day
and to-morrow. They differ from the first
class in that they wrote from the senses
rather than from the heart, and from those
of the second, who wrote primarily from the
brain. To them the war was a feast of new
sights, new thoughts, new emotions, which
blossomed into the fine flower of poetry.
They were more sophisticated than the boys,
more impressionable than the accepted men.
Thus W. W. Gibson in “Lament” :
We who are left, how shall we look again
Hanpily on the sun or teel the rain
Without remembering how they who went
Ungrudgingly and spent
Their all for us, loved, too, the sun and rain?
In this category belong Robert Nichols,
always beautiful, sometimes powerfully emo-
tional, and J. C. Squire, Sassoon and Seeger.
Most of these men are singing still, and
there is a, ripeness, a warmth and a passion
in their work to-day that might not have
been there had it not been for the war.
And, now, whom shall we keep? Rupert
Brooke must remain, for the occasional flash
of greatness and the spirit that was his;
and Wilfred Owen has won a place by sheer
merit and vastness of utterance. But most
of these slim singing hoys must go. lovely
'though they were. The young voices will
come again when the occasion arises. Gib-

Verlaine Among the Mystics
Emile Verhaeren calls Verlaine’s Sagesse
“the deepest and greatest work of r rench
poetry, the white crown of his work. ’ V er-
laine himself preferred “La Bonne Chanson :
La lune blanche
Luit dans les bois ;
De chaque branche
Part une voix
Sous la ram Ce....
O bien-aimfie.
, • •
Un vaste et tendre
Apaisement
Semble descendre
Du firmament
Que l’astre irise.. . .
C’est l’heure exquise.
A very wizard with words and syllables,
changing vowels into living color and music,
Verlaine stands confessed here as the singing
master of modern French verse. Such sheer
lyric beauty would be generous compensation
to most of us for volumes of what he himself
calls “literature.”
In “Sagesse” he emerges as a mystic
one result of his conversion to Catholicism—
and on his qualities as a mystic Verhaeren s
estimate more or less depends. “I am a
Catholic,” says Verlaine, “but a Catholic of
the Middle Ages.” And lie was, even as
Villon, whose genius so curiously resembles
liis own. An English mystic, poet and
contemporary of Verlaine’s has summed up
the essence of mysticism:
To most even good people God is a belief. To the
Saints He is an embrace. They have felt the wind
of His locks. His heart has beaten against their
side. They do not believe in Him for they know
Him.
Villon and Verlaine, though both for suffici-
ently good reasons would scout the idea, are
with the “good people.” Richard Craw-
shawe and Francis Thompson are with the
saints.
Une of the most striking things about
Verlaine was his power of turning casual
impressions and sensations into great poetry
by treating them emotionally. His new-found
belief appealed to the artist in him as some-
thing that could be analysed and dramatised.
The truth of the emotion, which for him was
the main thing, lay well within his grasp.
He was not particularly concerned as to its
intensity. The fact of the matter is that if he
abandoned himself to life he took small joy
in death, and so he is out of touch with all
the great mystics from Francis of Assisi to
Blake and Francis Thompson. Curiously
enough, in “Sagesse” the superb sense of infin-
ity that enfolds “les Pofemes saturniens,” the
“Romances Sans Paroles” and often the
“F@tes Galantes” deserts him, with one rare
exception. And the richly sensuous beauty
that flourishes elsewhere in him and, which
mystical verse like that of Crawshawe con-
stantly achieves, vanishes with the sense of
infinity. Verlaine’s mysticism is bloodless
beside “The Flaming Heart” or “The Hound
of Heaven.” It is not that his so-called
mysticism is a lesser thing than Crawshawe’s
or Herbert’s or Thompson’s, but thalf it dif-
fers absolutely in kind. The ritual on which
he based his faith was, to Verlaine, hardly
vital enough for him to strike from it the
glowing imagery essential to great mystical
verse. He rediscovers a subject called an im-
mortal soul which, from an emotional stand-
point, interests him vastly, but somehow
fails to evoke the artist of the earlier Wat-
teauesque landscapes or of “Paysages
Tristes.” He misses the extravagance of
the great mystics. “Art consists in being
absolutely oneself,” shouts Verlaine. But in
“Sagesse” he so constantly subdues his per-
sonality that he is not himself, and conse-
quently he falls short of the almost careless
sincerity and the impressionism which to him
is style itself. For once he is tempted to
reproduce rather than represent—“color”
rather than “nuance'’ —'and as he becomes
more definite his touch is less sure. A
pedestrian faith keeps him constitutionally
incapable of the fine excess of mysticism in
its larger sense. He does not love God and
the saints as he used to love Mathilde Maute
or Arthur Rimbaud. That splendid spiritual
gallantry which is the birthright of all great
mystics is lacking. When the exquisite artist
of the “Fgtes Galantes” became the great
poet of “Sagesse,” poetry tightened her
purse-strings.
Verlaine is at his best when he combines
the plastic beauty which comes into the
world with all good Parnassians, lit by the
impressions and inspiration so peculiarly his
own, with the rare metrical wilfulness that
grows with his craft.
To be in love with life is a fine thing for a
poet. With Verlaine the zest for living and
loving is intimately bound up with a “con-
fessional” habit and an uncanny power of
reproducing sensations. Strange scents
haunt his verse. Scents of flowers or of
beloved young bodies, or an insipid perfume
that gives a touch of realism, an atmosphere
of disenchantment, or a suggestion of irony
which is almost poignant, to what might
simply have been a rococo picture of some
“pays bleu.” There are few finer achieve-
ments in the poetry of the world and the
flesh than “La Mort de Philippe II.,” a little
drama of decaying civilisation that keeps the
reader standing on tiptoe on the threshold
of the immortal. The subtle breath of death
and decay, the weirdly dramatic effect of
isolated lines and the idea of fate brooding
over all things are there, and an uncanny
sense of character.
Many of the “Fetes Galantes” have the
finite perfection of mosaics. “Pantomime,”
for example, a frail little history elusively
suggestive of the powder-and-patch witchery
of yesteryear, and “L’Alkie” and “OythSre”
and the matchless miniature
of “Colloque Sentimental.” Shedding immor-
tality on the fleeting things of life, he plays
new variations on the theme of Art: “the
instant made eternity.”
Verlaine lives neither by the mysticism of
“Sagesse” at the one pole nor in “Chair and
the fleshly “Chansons pour Elle” at the
other. The real Verlaine is the poet ot
friendship and the Cafe Procope, of the
“Dedicacfes” and “Epigrammes,” the con-
summate artist of “Fetes Galarites,” “Eaux-
Fortes” and “Paysages Tristes”; the, man
who sang “II pleure dans mon eoeur,” who
was own son to Villon in largeness of intel-
lect and the capacity to express emotion.
Arthur Symons sums up Verlaine’s lyricism
in a couple of happy phrases: “He paints
with sound and his line and atmosphere be-
come music.” Verlaine himself does rather
better:
La chanson se m6le au clair de lune.

Concerning Greece and Sanitation
The moon was in a metal ring
Of hard and angry light;
Thin trails of cloud were seen to swing
Across the cold blue night,
When Julian the Apostate strode
Along the bleak suburban road.
I think he came from Antioch
Or some old town long dead ;
His crown looked heavy as a block
Of sorrow on his head.
Though made of golden laurel trails,
The thing appeared fixed on with nails.
He flopped on the verandah seat,
And like an emperor svvore
Some Latin oaths of special heat
That roused the folk next door ;
And as that language seemed too weak
lie cursed a solemn while in Greek.
Then, shaking his imperial gown,
He said: “I took the odds.
I tried to save their old renown;
But (curse the gilded gods!)
The man who tries to hear their call
Bangs his gold hat against a wall.
“I tried to save their falling shrines
And give them back their job,
To run the world on ancient lines,
And teach the Christian mob
That clear Athene’s voice was still
The thread of purpose in the will.
“What use? The brutish Asian thought
Had worn Olympus grey.
Goat-gods of serfs had turned to nought
The light that once could play
Round young Apollo in the strong
Great days of moving life and song.
“Not the white gods of Europe’s dream
Had moved the people’s hate;
But nigger fancies in a stream
Had poured across the State,
Making of bestial lust a creed —
Called Greek by those who would not read.
“Their stinking Pan was in the place
Of clean and heedless Zeus....
Oh. dash it all! The cold disgrace
Hits hard ; but what’s the use
Of raking up the ancient shame? —
We’ll say the niggers were to blame.
“But this is over all the odds” —
He waved an angry hand—
“ You pour contempt upon the gods
In your Australian land.
To White Australia luck and peace!—
But why declare that dirt is Greece?”
“Good sir,” I said, “the pipes of Pan
Are ringing on this shore.
They blew for art since art began ;
And now they blow some more
Because great artist-minds explain
That art without wild lust is vain.”
“Hell!” cried the Emperor. “Give me air!
I suffered jeers and gibes;
But not for that rude thing of hair,
That god of nigger tribes.
Old Athens took him as a jest—
The mob rose up and did the rest.
“Why is Apollo still dethroned —
Tlie king of light and fire?
To reeking Pan base helots groaned
To free their chained desire.
Shall art with love and beauty feast
At the same table as the beast?”
“Great sir,” I said, “you must not miss
The strong sex-impulse here,
The draggled wanton’s splendid kiss
That makes all colors clear.
Your gods were modest gods, you know:
But Pan —oh, trust me, Pan can blow!”
“And also hum !” the Apostate cried.
“Let in the light and air!
The sun is up, the world is wide;
E’en yet the gods may care.
Not staggering age that prates of youth
Shall see the rainbow arch of truth.”
The Emperor went across the street,
His head was proud and high.
If some “Hellenic” braves should meet
The fire that fills his eye
I think —though shibboleths are sleek —
His wrath might almost wash them Greek.

Fairy Lands Forlorn
Why is it that when we speak of the
great writers of Ireland we say Yeats, Synge,
James Stephens, James Joyce, St. John
Ervine and Thomas McDonagh, but omit the
sweetest, saddest singer of them all, Padraic
Pearse? He of all the poets has best mas-
tered the real, original Gaelic which is still
spoken in wilder parts of Ireland. He w'as
the founder of a school which had for its
aim the restoration of the Irish language
and the full development of Irish personality.
He probed and sought until he found the sor-
rowing heart’s heart of his country, and with
a pen dipped in tears he wrote his little
poems, his plays and tender stories. Into
far parts of Ireland, fairy lands forlorn, he
went, obsessed with her beauty, her speech,
her poetrv and her suffering. And he wove
from these a magic cloth of wonder.
All his work shows an intense feeling for
the music of words and the stringing of them
together in harmony. He himself wu-ites in
“An Macaomh”: “I have put no word, no
speech into the mouths of my people that
those whom I know well would not use in
the same circumstances.” The old gods of
Ireland have little place in his work. He
uses them only as a background for his satu-
rating Christianity. He remembers them
tenderly as forerunners of a greater glory.
His plays are not for ordinary theatres or
for ordinary players. They require a certain
atmosphere and a deep love of beauty on the
part of the actors. It would be impossible
for any one not sympathetic with Ireland to
portray his characters. They must be treated
with the reverence due to a prayer. And
through all his writings there leaps and
sings, sighs and croons his overwhelming love
for children, “the young, soft things.” I
can imagine him seated on a green hill sur-
rounded by children, pouring into their de-
lighted ears the sad little story of Eoineen,
who so loved the swallows that when the
time came for them to fly away to the warm
south he went with them “over the wild
seas.. . .to the country where it does be sum-
mer always. And there was heard the cry-
ing of a woman in that lonely place—the
crying of a mother keening her child.” Or,
again, he might have told his ragged audi-
ence the story of Barbara, “a little wooden
doll that was bald, and it purblind ; but its
two cheeks were red as a berry, and there
was a smile on its mouth,” and how Barbara
saved the life of Brideen, her mother, who
was five itself. Then, maybe, his eyes would
grow' more tender and his voice soft and re-
verent as he whispered of losagan, the “little
brown boy, with a white .coat on him like
W'as on every other boy, and he without shoes
or cap, and it seems that there were, as it
would be, rays of light coming from his head.
The sun shining on his share of hair, may-
be.” And how the Holy Child took by the
hand old Matthias “who hadn’t bent his
knee for the length of threescore years”
and led him to the house or His Father.
But in the plays and later poems, and the
story of the Mother, comes the foreshadow-
ing of agony and sorrow', of his tragic life
and early death, Mac Dara in “The Singer,”
w'alking among the poor of the city and the
poor of the roads, is Padraic Pearse him-
self. He, too, w'ent out on a great adventure
and said, with Mac Dara, “I will take no
pike. I w'ill go into the battle with bare
hands.” The suffering he had seen, “the
bare marriage feasts, the candleless wakes,”
slipped fingers of doubt and anguish into his
eyes; yet his heart still believed, still hoped,
splendidly faithful, that freedom and happi-
ness would come. But the heart that shook
with pity for all human things and was glad
with a great joy
To see a leaping squirrel in a tree,
Or little rabbits in a field at evening
Lit by the slanting sun,
Or children with bare feet upon the sands
Of some ebbed sea, or playing in the streets
Of little towns in Cannacht.
w’ent down upon its way sorrowful.

A Satchel of Books
The Romance of Fiddler’s Green, by Clara Endi-
cott Sears (Houghton Mofflin Co.). This writer
found a new field ; she is working the Shakers, the
queer old sect which was given a bad time (that it
didn’t generally deserve) by the cold, rigid, suspi-
cious Puritans of the conventional . New England
pattern. Add to this uncommon setting a seductive
manner and a story whose interest never loses itself,
and you get one of the best of the American novels
of the season.
Eden of Bringard, bv Wilkinson Sherren (Cecil
Palmer). A romance of Wessex in the ay R : n
the Homans were putting the leg-rope 0 other
Plenty of blood in it, of course—blood and other
things, including, as far as written history wiU let
us judge, a fairly faithful picture 9! the homes 1
the period. Including the accessories of a «®man
feast—vomitorium and all. On the whde,
even a jazz in between courses is better. ine
ject asks for vivid treatment, and gets it.
Give and Take, by Amber <H"rst and
Blackett). This long book is by Mrs. Blanco White,
the daughter of W. P. Reeves, a former M.L. Min-
ister and subsequently Agent-General. The story is
packed with political intrigue within the Ministry
of Reconciliation during the latter stages of. t*
war. Strikes, labor agitations, housing and intri-
cate problems of employment are all touched on, ana
Mrs. White, having held a in one of the
Government departments during the troublesome
times, is able to ornament her scenes with such a
wealth of description that it reads in places like
Sidney Webb having an argument with Beonoia
Eyles. There is plenty of vigor and humor in the
story, but the uncanny subtlety apparently designed
to show the brilliance of the writer is positively
frightening.
The Seven Ages of Woman, by Compton Mackenzie
(Martin Seeker). This attempt to cover the life of
a woman from infancy to old age is rather scrappy
and nebulous. Still the author produces a sugges-
tion of the lady's romantic sensibilities slowly per-
ishing in the disillusionments of wifehood and
maternity, and also creates an atmosphere of emo-
tional want, only half gratified at the finish when
she adopts her granddaughter, in imitation of her
own grandma 60 years before. The book is delicate
and tasteful, tender and ironic, and magnificently
removes characters that become superfluous or dis-
quiet! ng ; but of solid, sustaining portraiture <t
hasn’t a jot. About the only figure who achieves
veracity is the lowly female who marries her son,
Geoffrey, and tartly refuses all efforts to patronise
or help her. Compton Mackenzie has, at any rate,
faithfully dramatised her contemptuous sniff.
Dohachi. by John Ayscougli (Chapman and Dodd).
The Cormshman has a large capacity for emotion,
and probably the little principality has yielded
more sectlets than any other part of England. This
is the well-told tale of one of them—the Marchers
to Zion, who set themselves up somewhere on the
New England coast. A descendant of the leaders,
Zechariah Trelose and Miriam Mehenrick, was
called lehabod, for that “the glory has departed
from our house” ; and when it was Ichabod’s turn
to have a child he stood the name on its head to
bring the glory back again. The plan Seems to
have succeeded; and Dobaehi (the name passed
muster, having a good Biblical sound) had more
luck than she could have reasonably expected. It
isn’t an attractive community that the descendants
of these ill-balanced Pilgrim Fathers make; but it
offers John Ayscough a field for good studies of the
types it would naturally produce. Some of the
developments are pretty swift; but, generally, the
author has done his work faithfully.

“R.H.”: Let me apologise to Miss (or
Mrs.) Cecil Warren (R.P. 7/6/’23) if I un-
intentionally hurt her feelings in my article
on “The Evolution of Love.” _ If she will
read it again she will see that in the offend-
ing sentence I was simply explaining why
the Greeks took to homo-sexuality ; a Greek
w’anted a mute who would fight, if need be,
and I doubt if any woman would care to
face a hoplite in sword and armor. I quite
agree that woman possesses all the qualities
enumerated by Mrs. (or Miss) Warren, but
it is only comparatively recently that man
has recognised the fact. That is why I have
the honor to be a member of the N.S.W.
Feminist Club.

Zapaterin.
Zapaterin cuts from the fragrant leather
Shoes for the brown feet bare;
Within his cap is a scarlet feather
Such as the gypsies wear,
And tender his eyes
As his needle flies,
Stitching his shoes and his dreams together.
Zapaterin’s shop is a place of laughter—-
Swift through the gloom it slips;
It shakes the dust from each trembling rafter,
Curves on the children’s lips;
And the air is sweet
With its dancing feet,
With songs, and the echoes that follow after.
Zapaterin, say, from whom do you borrow
Gladness to make you wise?
Is there no thought of a sad to-morrow
Hiding behind your eyes?
In forgotten years
Did you once know tears
That you cobble my shoes with a thread of
sorrow ?

Tropic Spring Song.
Offer your lilies, frahgipanni! Lift
The netted basket of your perfumed gift
To mollify the fierceness of the noon;
Plead for the coming of the wet monsoon!
You, poincianas, pray that you be drenched
And every flambeau on your branches
quenched!
Renounce, O royal bougainvillaea,
Your purple—put it utterly away!
Cassia, when the thirsty lightning gapes,
Assuage it with your yellow globes like
grapes!
Give up all this hypocrisy of Spring
Here in a clime where there is no such
thing.
Welcome torrential rains that grow and die
In little distances, and the split sky
Of deafening thunder! We would see and
hear
Something, however violent, more sincere.

Temptation.
I love you, sweet Temptation! Come again
Upon the morrow and each morrow on ;
Lead me into the byways, and anon
Show me the pastures not upon the plain.
Take from me ample measure in the pain
That weak men fear; thus might I drink
to you
From flagons brimmed with each forbidden
brew,
Though every sip imprint a lasting stain.
For I have learned that envy is not meet
Where you have stayed the power of your
charm,
And passed men by and left them solemn
clods.
So come, Temptation, with your guerdons
sweet,
And I shall love you, take you on my arm,
And walk with you into the realm of gods.

The Outcast.
He had no time for women, so they say,
Was queer that way;
Just lived for drink and what it brought
to him.
AVho knows? Some dim,
Vague vision sweet—maybe (a boon no less)
Forgetfulness.
I know not. ’Twas his secret. He is dead,
With no word said
To man or woman of the force that drove
His heart to rove
Hell’s highways with the grey witch Memory
For company.
Perchance in Death’s dark tavern now he
quaffs
His glass and laughs
At Life that broke him on its wheel, and
Shame
That smirched his name,
And Love that fashioned his Gethsemane
Of Memory.

The Taffetas Cloak.
A taffetas cloak on an old peg hangs,
Cowslip-colored as dairy cream.
Yet it seems to me as a body swinging
To and fro from an oaken beam ;
Such sombre secrets a touch awoke
In the dust that came from a woman’s cloak.
A finger of light has found the attic:
It moves, to point like a seeking sword
Where a rose of silk at the throat is fastened,
Looped across with a satin cord.
And passes down to a clasp of paste
That played the shield to a rounded waist.
There’s a tiny stain on one shimmering
shoulder,
Brown as the leaf of a summer fled—
Was it ever vivid, and wet, and spreading,
Red on the cloak as a bloom is red?
Was it ruddy wine when the Mad Hours
ride?
Or the point of a rapier turned aside?
In the taffetas cloak a spider crouches:
I saw the twitch of his hairy legs,
And he seemed as the soul of a long-dead
woman
That out of the grave-clothes creeps, and
begs
That the taffetas cloak be left to hide
The price she paid for her laughing pride!
I can see from the open attic window
A new green leaf on a tall tree’s crest,
And the mottled wings of a bird, adventuring
Into sun from a fresh-built nest,
W’hile the loosened dust from each silken fold
Dissolves in blue like a mist of gold.

AN UNPROTECTED INDUSTRY.
The spirit of Nationalism (the word has
been prostituted by the politicians, but no
other will serve) which swept over Australia
as a result of the achievements of our sol-
diers and sailors in the late war, has natu-
rally produced a cultural renascence. But
many of those who are prominently identified
with the movement urge Australians, directly
or indirectly, to be anything but Australian.
George Lambert would send every artist
of merit to London. Other members of the
intelligentsia want us to be Greek. This is
not altogether surprising. The coastal
climate of our settled regions, where
nearly all the artists and professional
writers live, is the coastal climate of
Greece —neither too cold nor too hot
for nudity during three-quarters of the
year. And our young people go in exten-
sively for the pastimes which beautify the
body—surfing, swimming, boxing and tennis.
Australia might produce a Praxiteles to-
morrow in the sense that all the conditions
are favorable. England never has, and in
the natural order of events, never will.
Natural conditions apart, there was no
magic about the force that gave the world
the art of Greece, the Age of Marble. It
was the same force that gave the world the
literature of the European renascence—a
spirit of competition induced by the expec-
tation of applause and money. It is this
force that has given the art of painting the
little loc&l renascence which is shortly to
find expression in an Australian exhibition
of pictures in London. Rich Australians
began to buy Australian pictures because it
was too expensive to import foreign ones.
Then someone discovered that many Austra-
lian pictures, besides being cheap, were beau-
tiful. The artists, greatly encouraged, pro-
ceeded to paint harder and charge more. A
new industry had arisen on typically Greek
lines.
But what of literature? In the 16th, 17tli
and early 18th century England or France,
a man who wrote a tine play or poem, or,
for that matter, any sort of play or poem, be-
came at least as famous as our Jack Greg-
orys and Sid Godfreys. Noblemen were as
glad to talk with noted writers as Austra-
lian publicans are to go motoring with
jockeys. A statesman gave Swift a sine-
cure in his household, and a king was proud
to perform a similar service for Voltaire.
One Australian Governor recognised Austra-
lian poetry to the extent of asking Victor
Daley and Henry Lawson to Government
House. But his successors fell back on “the
better elements of the community”—politi-
cians and profiteers—and the only occasion
when an eminent Australian poet now has
a prospect of recognition in high official
circles is on the day of his funeral. The
profession of literature is not only unfashion-
able, it is almost as unprofitable as art was
in the days when no one bought an Aus-
tralian picture who could afford a German
oleograph. The daily press is chiefly to
blame. When “Australia Week” conies
round the typical big-city paper is to be
found calling heartily on its readers to buy
Australian goods and not set the cost against
the interests of the nation. The cry is taken
up by politicians, publicity experts and other
fluent leaders of thought, and soon all hands
are urging the people to buy one another’s
products or stand confessed as destitute of
patriotism. The solitary exception concerns
the products of local writers. Preference
could not be urged, with any semblance
of consistency, in the columns of a journal
which offers its readers au instalment of an
English 75,000-word serial, for which about
2s. 6d. per column has been paid ; a syndi
cated article by an English politician which
has cost the paper, say, half-a-guinea; and
a couple of pages of advertisements of Yankee
picture-films and Yankee and British plays.
The politicians are not in a position to legis-
late for the benefit of Australian writers. To
do so would annoy their press patrons, who
want to be allowed to go on buying litera-
ture at coolie rates, and the change might
not be immediately remunerative as regards
votes.
* * * *
Two arguments are commonly employed
by interested parties against giving that pro-
tection to Australian writings which they
nearly all admit is owed to Australian goods.
In the first place it is claimed (meanly
enough at bes.t) that a work of art is an
inspiration ; that human beings do imagina-
tive work as the birds sing, and will produce
it whether the pay in praise and cash is
adequate or not. The best evidence against
this comfortable theory is the historical fact
that no country has known a golden age, in
sculpture, painting or literature, without
rigid protection. The most rigid of all was
that of Athens, which, after the War of
Independence, mobilised within its own w r alls
practically the whole intelligence and cul-
ture of the world. The Elizabethans had a
substantial measure of protection. The Eng-
lish language was not used outside England ;
if an Englishman wanted to see a play or
read a book he had to be satisfied —unless he
was that rarity, a classical or French or
Italian scholar —w’ith a home-made article.
The case of modern England is slightly differ-
ent. English literature has been hit as hard
by the competition of American writers as
English manufacturers have been by the
competition of American goods. But London
is the Athens of the English-speaking world.
Is is the goal of almost every man or woman
with something to sell in the cultural line
—as this country, amongst others, has had
bitter reason to know. The England of to-
day—given the protection 16th century Eng-
land had —would no doubt achieve something
amazing in literature, for the British have
been the world’s greatest natural writers for
several centuries; even with the protection
it has, the country of Hardy. Wells, Kip-
ling, Bennett and a score of others is
doing relatively well. As for Australia, it
is far away from the chief centres of
intellectual effort; it is bombarded with
cheap books from every part of the English-
speaking woifid; and the United Kingdom
and the U.S.A., by unloading on it the stage
equivalents of £lO serials, blanket its efforts
to produce a national drama.
* ♦ * *
The second argument against protecting
local literature is that anything of the sort
would represent a tax on knowledge. The
objection, if sincere, might be met by an
agreement to put no restrictions on any mat-
ter that a competent board of experts decided
was likely to add to the national stock of
useful learning. Such a provision would not
apply to 90 per cent, of the dramas, comedies,
films and novels which are now entering the
Commonwealth; in fact, most of them de-
serve to be barred as detrimental education-
ally and otherwise. The effect of encourage-
ment was interestingly shown the 'other day
when Sydney Telegraph (one of the few
Australian dailies which try consistently
to help Australian art and literature) offered
a £lOO prize for an Australian play, together
with Oscar Asche’s assurance that if a
worthy work resulted he would produce it.
The paper had over 200 plays submitted, and
there can be no question as to the merits of
several of them. Suppose every daily paper
were to print a proportion of creative work
by Australians, and that every theatre and
picture house were to present a proportion
of Australian dramas and scenarios. The
certain effect would be—more especially if
the change came in conjunction with a tariff
on overseas fiction —to produce a literary
renascence similar to that which has
occurred in our Art world. Such a develop-
ment would be worth a State subsidy, if
only as an advertisement for the Common-
wealth abroad. And a dramatist or a novel-
ist, like an artist, is a continuing advertise-
ment from which posterity benefits. A Vic-
tor TrTjmpEr or a Les Darcy dies; a
Norman Brookes grows old and is presently
forgotten, but a Shakspeare and a Dickens
live on. Australia can have the beginnings
of an important literary and dramatic school
to-morrow, as it already has the beginnings
of an important artistic school, but it will
have to pay for it as it has paid for its
commercial industries.
HODGE OF MERRIE ENGLAND.
A little while ago a bill for the abolition
of hereditary titles passed its first reading
in the British House of Commons. It passed
only by accident, a dazed Speaker having
forgotten to call on the “Noes” ; but it was
a sign of the times, none the less. The “old
nobility,” of which a great deal is so new that
the ink is hardly dry on the cheque that it
bought its title with, has had various losses
of late. It lost its veto on legislation, as a
result of a dashing bit of procedure when
it rejected the Budget by 350 votes to i 5
on the night of November 30, 1909, an in-
credible rally of bedridden and senile noble-
men having swelled the attendance to 10
times the usual number. For that it was
told it must pass a measure for its own par-
tial suicide, or suificient new and reliable
peers would be created for the purpose, even
if it was necessary to raise to the Upper
House all the breweries of Britain. Tnen
the old nobility lost much of the public’s re-
spect through being too numerous, as well
as being futile and the result of purchase.
For much the same reasons it lost a good
deal of its own respect, so that to-day about
the most passionate roarer for reform roars
disrespectfully in its own bosom. This is
Lord Birkenhead, who represents a peer-
age only four years old, the son of a father
named Smith and a mother who was
Taylor before she rose to be Smith. Birk-
enhead has hardly begun to be hereditary
yet, but he has a dream that if the House
was reduced in numbers and had some brain
or other qualification it might so far recover
popular esteem that the Conservative Gov-
ernment would venture to give it back its
veto. To add to its other losses, the peerage
dropped a lot of money through the war, and
some of its brightest ornaments got down
to the degradation, when they discharged
the servants and shut up the stately home, of
publishing a balance-sheet —presumably to
show that they hadn’t lost- the money at
Monte Carlo or bought Flossies with it,
blit that their agricultural properties were
running at a loss. And a sort of final cala-
mity seems possible, for Giles Hodge —the
bucolic Hodge of Merrie England—has lately
been joining unions and going on strike. In
1914 the National Agricultural Laborers’
Union and the agricultural section of the
Workers’ Union together had 18,288 mem
bers. By 1921 they had 350,000. And that
means more than one-half of the total of agri-
cultural laborers, who, according to the last
count and including shepherds, numbered
only 600,000 for England and Wales. A far
greater number of farmers are paying either
rent or interest on the money they borrowed
when they bought out the landlord at boom
prices in the happy days of the war. In
the almost-happy days before the war the
average wage of Hodge in England was 17s.
9d. per week ; largely by the efforts of the
unions, backed, of course, by the war during
the war years, the minimum in 1921 was
465. per week. Never before in the his-
tory of England was the wage-drawing
Hodge paid so much; hardly ever, if ever,
was the nominal farm-owner or -renter so
badly off.
Yet, on the face of things, it might seem
that there is a glimmer of hope on the hori-
zon. In England, going by the records of
the last nine or ten years, the maximum
wheat yield is 3530 bushels per 100 acres,
and as the minimum is 2850 bushels there
are no sudden shocks in the business as there
are in Australia, where the maximum was
1608 bushels to 100 acres, and the minimum
258 bushels. Moreover, it is difficult for
the English farmer to be more than 50 miles
from a market, and it is that market which
regulates Australia’s price; so that Aus-
tralia gets the same price less the cost of
several times as much land freight and
12,000 miles of sea freight. But rent—the
exaction from which Ireland got practically
free by a brisk process of revolt —eats up, or
used to eat up, what would be reckoned a
fair crop in some parts of Australia. The
landlord must be kept up, and even in his
reduced condition one of the Sutherland
type, with six peerages, requires a good deal
of nourishment. And local rates, payable
b,y the tenant, form an item difficult for the
Australian to understand. In England and
Wales, for the year 1921-22, the amount col-
lected was £173,000,600, or £4 11s. 4d. per in-
habitant. During the same year the average
direct taxation levied by the State Govern-
ments here was £3 4s. 2d. per inhabitant;
so in England a mere mayor and corporation
can beat our whole State Government by
many yards in a hundred. Here the average
tenant pays no rates, and if he is in a very
small way he pays practically no direct
State taxes. Loans fill the gap—for the
time. In Britain even the denizen of a
small, high-up domicile in a tenement house
is accustomed to whole processions toiling up
his stair, asking for road rate, lighting rate,
water rate, education rate, general rate, and
poor rate.
Of course, if instead of paying off its
debts Britain went on borrowing, as Aus-
tralia is doing, matters would for the moment
be easier for the farmer. But Britain isn’t
mad enough to escape for a few years from
one great difficulty by planting the seeds
of a greater one. Nor does Protection pro-
mise much for him. Protection is intended
to promote local' production; but sufficient
local production seems quite impossible, no
matter what the tariff. Merrie England had
a good deal more than a person to the acre
on census day; and the situation becomes
strained when an average family. of four
tries to live on 3f acres and accommodate
thereon its house, garden, office, factory,
cemetery, coal-mine, iron-mine, public build-
ings, school, gaol, lunatic asylum, docks and
sundries, and grow its grain and feed its
flocks in between. Some of the millions will
have to be shifted: it is insanity to have
an empire w’ith some of its people huddled
so close in a small island that they can’t
grow their own victuals, but must pay car-
riage on them over tens of thousands of miles,
while a few more of its people are scattered
over dominions which could comfortably nro-
duce a hundred times more food. And it
is even more insane for the artisans en-
gaged in making woollens and cottons and
things for the scattered dominions’ use to
huddle in the small island ; for there is a
double or a treble lot of waste in that case—
waste in carrying raw materials to make the
goods with, and food to feed the operatives,
and, finally, the manufactured articles back
to the people who will buy them. No won-
der, while the British farmer is hard up,
there are a million and a half unemployed
in Britain: an empire which tries to run
its business on such lines would have just
as much chance of escaping trouble as The
Bulletin would if it decided to keep its
writing staff in Spitzbergen, its artists at
Bourke and its printing plant alongside
Niagara Falls. But even the redistribution
of the Empire’s white population will not
solve the problem for either the farmer of
Merrie England or the wage-earning Hodge :
for the latter, though on a fair wicket for
the moment, will gradually find that his job
is slipping away from him, leaving him with
less wages thaai he got when his • minimum”
was only about one-third as much as it is
now. For both of them the only hope seems
to be in making the farmers small, inde-
pendent proprietors like those of Ireland —
with safeguards, of course, against the aggre-
gation of farms and the starting of the
whole trouble over again.
THE SLUMBUGS AND PUFFADDERS.
Thoughts of a man on a fixed salary:—
On my desk as I write are curt communications
from W. H. Whiddon, N. S. Wales Commissioner of
Taxation, and T. S. Hulme, Federal tax-gatherer for
the same State. Both remind me (having got the
information from two quarters) of the amount I re-
ceived last year for my contributions to the news-
paper which has the misfortune to employ me, and
mention what they insist on extracting of it.
Hulme I will pay with philosophic resignation,
knowing that my money, less the expense of getting
it in, will go towards war interest and sinking fund,
which totalled 21 millions last year. But Whiddon
is another pair of sleeves. I don’t know a more
efficient tax-collector, or one who runs his office
better, but I never settle his annual bill without the
feeling that 1 have been “had” —that of every
shilling he drags from me only threepence is for the
legitimate expenses of government, the ninepenee
being an enforced contribution to the cost of running
demented State undertakings, like hopeless ami
superfluous railways, not to mention the fish-shops,
whose manager had such an odd habit of hiding
hundreds of pounds under carpets.
This brings me to the general statement that
direct taxation, as levied in Australia, is largely a
swindle. The most gorgeous limousine in my
neighborhood is owned by Puffaddek, the profiteer.
Having made a fortune during the war by selling
fur coats to soldiers’ wives, Puffadder devoted por-
tion of it to buying an expensive house and furniture,
the limousine aforesaid, and dazzling raiment and
jewels for Mrs. Puffadder (her portrait has appeared
in the Sunday Slobber with the information that
“she dresses beautifully and is -one of the smartest
jazzers in our younger set”), and put the rest into
tax-free securities, Commonwealth and State. I sup-
pose his income from these investments amounts to
10 times my salary; moreover, he hasn’t done a tap
of work since he sold out of the rabbit-skin business.
But whereas Hulme and Whiddon get down on me
for my few shillings a week, they let Puffadder
alone. Another casual dweller in our suburb, where
his wife is malignantly hated by matrons who can’t
afford to wear the stunning furs and diamonds that
adorn her ample form, is Koiiansteix the bookmaker.
In the jargon of his tribe, Koiiansteix “follows the
meetin’s.” January finds him in Perth for the
local Derby and Cup; in February he'goes to Mel-
bourne for the Newmarket Handicap; April draws
him to Sydney for the Doncaster-an’-Cup; in May
he proceeds to Adelaide, in June to Brisbane, and so
on. By never staying too long in one place
Kohanstein avoids paying State income-tax. Should
he be asked to submit a return (a thing which
never happens to the thousands of shop and street
Kohansteins, whose profits are such that they pay
their agents 10 p.c. of all money staked), it is easy
for him to show r that his earnings were less than the
statutory exemption of £2OO or £250. Unlike the
man on a fixed salary, he is allowed to deduct front
his income bad debts, real or alleged, travelling
expenses to his place of business, and “any other
expense actually incurred in the production of
income,” which may be, and doubtless is, con-
strued to mean wagers lost to other bookmakers, or
said to have been lost, in pursuit of his useless
calling. I can’t say whether Kohanstein has ever
paid tribute to my persistent correspondent Hulme,
bijt to get at such as Kohanstein an all-Australian
Income-tax Act, with an Australian-wide department
administering it, is manifestly necessary. Under
the division of imposts decided upon by the Bruce-
Page Government, Kohanstein’s income will vir-
tually be as tax-free as Puffadder’s.
* * * *
Another who will profit by the new' arrangement is
that worthy Nationalist and King-and-Empire Leaguer,
Slumbug. Slumbug’s income (£9OO a year, I
believe) is derived from house property. He draws
rents for three or four dwellings in Sydney, two
or three in Melbourne, a couple in Brisbane and
others in Perth and Adelaide. He has so ordered
the matter as to be exempt from the State income-
taxes, but Hulme hits him up to the tune of £25 or
£3O a year. However, w'hen the Commonwealth levies
on companies, and the States on individuals, Hulmf.
will cease to handle Slumbug’s cheque, and that
person—as useless and unornamental a loafer as
ever cumbered the earth —will enjoy the same proud
privilege as Puffadder and Kohanstein.
• • • «
Slumbug calls Bruce a statesman after his (Slum-
bug’s) own heart. That may be true (I hope it
isn’t), but a real statesman w’ould labor not to
deserve Slumbug’s approbation. Any proposal that
favors Slumbug, Kohanstein and Puffadder at the
expense of the large body of taxpayers who w'ork
usefully for their living proclaims its own rotten-
ness. A genuine scheme of fiscal reform would pro-
vide for (1) the redemption, at the earliest possible
moment, of all tax-free loans, so that the Puff-
adders may be made to pay for the privilege of
living on the community’s toil; (2) the surrender
of the income-tax by the States to the Commomvealth :
and (3) the surrender of the present taxes On
land, entertainments and probates by the Common-
wealth to the States. These imposts, which will be
unnecessarily duplicated if Bruce’s proposals go
through, brought in approximately £3,000,000 last
year. In 1917-18 the States rubbed along with an
income-tax revenue of £4,843,000, and that sum,
prudently handled, would suffice for their present
necessities. The difference between the two amounts
could be made up, without hardship to any deserv-
ing interest, by the taxation of land values. In the
past few years the State Governments have taken
too much from personally-earned incomes and com-
pany profits and too little from the ill-gotten gains
of land sharks and their kind. Since the war
millions have been made by speculative dealings in


city and suburban property, but only a ridiculously
small portion has found its way into the Treasury.
No harm could come of continuing the 255. p.h.
payment, and the small subventions which Tasmania
and Westralia receive, for a term of years. The
thing is at least an incentive to the frontier-States
to increase their population.
COSTS AND CULTURE.
When Archbishop Kelly recently wanted
to know why State Education in N. S.
Wales was costing £l3 per child per annum
while his own variety of the article was
offering at £6 10s., it was easy to explain
that a large part of the difference was due
to salary which Church Brother and Sister
do not collect; and then silence set in. no
doubt the explanation was correct, and
certainly as weighty as the remark required,
but both question and answer remain so
far off the real subject of the Cost of Edu-
cation as to appear almost trivial. So, too,
when a disgruntled taxpayer falls a halt-
column of the Daily Telegraph with
amazed wrath at the sheer iniquity of pay-
ing £7 or £9 or £5OO or whatever it is per
week to, school-teachers who, after all, are
very poorly educated, lazy and altogether
worthless people, it is similarly easy for
the teacher to use up as much ink the next
day with conclusive proof that he is the best-
trained, hardest-worked and worst-paid per-
son in the world. Both letters are interest-
ing; but for anyone who would really get
to the heart of the business they are no
more satisfying than the entertaining patter
about the £l3 versus the £6 10s.
A much more pertinent contribution on the
old subject—the fact that 96 medical gradu-
ates were the other afternoon turned loose
from the Sydney University—does not seem
to have been recognised as such. Indeed,
but for the somewhat peevish comment from
older doctors to the effect that the profes-
sion is already too overcrowded to be as lucra-
tive as it could be, it attracted hardly any
notice at all. Yet there is a lot lurking
behind that 96. Infants’ schools, primary
schools, high schools and university could
point though 16 years or more of the best
teaching, with the most expensive material,
in the best-equipped schools, by the most
highly-paid teachers, to 96 finished products
of the educational mill. Exactly how much
the State wants these 96, how much it has
paid for them and what it expects to get
from them or they from it, would be embar-
rassing questions. The account is ruled off
at £l3 per head per annum.
In the same city, about the same date and
hailing from the same infants’, primary and
even super-primary schools, there were also
turned loose very many times 96 young men
whose profession, trade or business is just
plain nothing. These are not to be con-
fused \yith the yearly output of parasites and
hoboes, for whom no educational system ought
to accept full credit or blame, though it
will not be difficult for the others to become
these same things later on. At present they
are just young Australians of very much
the same physical, mental and moral weight
as the newly-hatched medico, but without
his training, or any other training They
were at school with him a few years ago,
where they enjoyed the same lessons and
cost N. S. Wales the same £l3 per year,
or Dr. Kelly’s cut-rate of £6 10s., while
they remained there. Whether they were
failures through not learning what the
schools taught, or whether the schools were
failures through not teaching what could
be learned; whether they could not afford
to stay at school longer, or whether the
schools could not teach them enough in
the few years they did stay—these con-
siderations must be mere asides mentioned
in undertones. The question is one of
Costs. Educationally they have been fin-
ished, like the graduates, and turned out to
serve the State in the various ways in which
the State has paid over good coin to be
served. In their case, however, an average
rate of £l3 per head is likely to be very
wide of the mark. An entirely unprofes-
sional and jobless person may not have
received his full £l3 worth at school. On
the other hand he is quite likely to require
a State to add to his cost such items as: —
(a) Sundry millions to build useless public works
providing him with what has temporarily the appear-
ance of useful work.
(b) Relief pay when he isn’t working.
•(c) Free accommodation in gaol occasionally.
It is altogether too early yet to complete
his score. With the graduate it is too late.
When they commenced school together
their costs were equal at first; but as the
school was to a great extent heading all its
learners towards the same cultured end, the
unskilled one found he had no use for this
particular kind of schooling, and dropped
out by the way, and the graduate tended
more and more to hog the lot. Every time
that £l3 was not used up by a Bill Smith
who now throws dirt into a dray on the
city railway, it was added on to the initial
£l3 of one of the comparatively few who
can manage to go right through with the
Educational System—perhaps a William
Smythe who has pursued his studies even
to the lofty heights of clothing himself as
an indecent female on Commem. Day.
N. S. Wales boasts of a high brand of edu-
cation, but it would seem to be effective only
for those who can manage to wait for the
full dose. A few years of it seems to pre-
pare for nothing or very little; and N. S.
Wales, like any other country, cries aloud
for the efficient service of workers who can-
not remain at school for 16 years. A nur-
seryman takes a hundred seedlings, spends
sixpenn’orth of bonedust on each, allows 50
to wither entirely out of the story, and raises
at last two perfect plants and a vague num-
ber of nondescripts that he didn’t intend
and can’t use. If then he gives his total
cost as sixpence each, he ought to guess
again.
Boys from school have for years been clus-
tering into these groups:—
(a) The highly-skilled and highly-paid professions,
the above 96 graduates being one ready example.
(b) The army of more or less skilled thinkers and
workers who keep the country alive, whose efficiency
is sometimes due to schooling and just as often in
spite of it, and whose skill, earning power, value
and enjoyment are not nearly as great as a purpose-
ful education ought to make them.
(e) The totally unskilled workers (in other times
and lands labelled serfs or coolies) who are told
regularly from election platforms that they are
everybody else’s equals, but who lacked either the
chance or desire to be anything at all, and whose
sole asset now is mtiscle.
It is alarming when an attempt is made to
estimate just how many of us are in each
of these classes.
As for Costs, let us forget all about the
£l3 and the £6 10s. and honestly tackle the
questions:— ‘
1. Which of these groups do we want most?
2. For which can we afford to pay?
3. What brand of education is likely to give us
what we really want?

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Bruce-Page Policy.
The Bruce-I’age Government opened Par-
liament with rather more than the usual
drapery, and with a programme from which
the things that really matter were curiously
absent. The general impression created is
that it is a combination which isn’t too well
fitted for big things and doesn’t want any
trouble in doing them, and which has a
dislike for being unorthodox or unusual. That
orthodox feeling often gets in the way of big
things. Thus though the assistanf-Prime
Minister entered politics to achieve the sub-
division of the unwieldy States, or one of
them, the matter doesn’t figure conspicu-
ously on the programme. Presumably this
is because subdivision is, in absurd theory, a
purely State Parliament affair, and it is the
polite thing to leave it to the State Parlia-
ments, with a firm conviction that it might
as well be left in the waste-paper basket.
The programme includes a Federal debt-
sinking fund, and a sinking fund is always a
good thing, especially if it shows the slight-
est capacity for overtaking the debt. But it
would be too unusual for the Government to
announce its definite intention to transfer the
profits of the note issue, and the baby bonus
money, and any other odd funds it could find
or raise to a special sinking fund (its own
special fund) against the State debts, such
an act being an interference with State
Frights. Aet it is the State rather than
the Federal debts that are liable to pull the
Commonwealth down; it is the Common-
wealth’s subjects that the State Governments
are pawning; and the Commonwealth will
be expected to come to the rescue if there
is a day of crisis. By way of a remarkable
labor-saving device, the construction of the
Canberra Metropolis in Two Pieces is to be
placed in the hands of a Board, with power
to borrow. It can thus go ahead without
bringing the weary subject up annually be-
fore a Parliament in which some are cranks,
and some are scolters, and some are indif-
ferent. The Ministry, like its futile prede-
cessor, has a pious aspiration to convert all
the railway systems to the standard gauge.
This doesn’t take the form of a stern resolve
to convert the 677 miles of Federal BJft.
gauge railway to the standard, or to com-
plete, on the standard gauge, the big line in
its own estate to which its honor is pledged.
Instead, it assumes the shape of a craving
to construct lines which are not its affair.
Other items of policy include a uniform
bankruptcy law, improved old age pensions
and some sundries. But the matter that is the
biggest and most urgent of all receives prac-
tically no attention. Australia has ceased
to grow north. It ceased 60 years ago. The
line of very moderately effective occupation
is in the old place, from a trifle above Bris-
bane to a little above Perth. The line
of fairly effective occupation runs from
just above Brisbane to Port Augusta.
The biggest town north of the two lines is
Rockhampton, which set up with a mayor
and corporation 63 years ago, and has now
no more than 24,000 people. Because sundry
important countries are from two up to
several times as much in need of space
as they were 63 years ago, the tendency
to call our title into question increases. Be-
cause the Commonwealth owns the N. Terri-
tory, and because it is the Commonwealth,
this is the Bruce-Page Government’s direct
and overwhelming responsibility. It is no
small matter to own, and for hungry nations
to know that we own, and to see that we
apparently don’t care 2d. if we lose, an area
of half-a-million sq. miles. Save for the
Cook episode, which lasted only 15 months
and closed in 1914, the unique wrack and
ruin of the past 13 years in this territory
was the work of Ministries which included
Hughes and his admiring pupil Pearce.
Out of the entire Bruce-Page outfit Pearce
was the one man who had to swear that the
methods from which these results arose were
good methods and should be continued, or
else had to condemn and stultify his whole
Ministerial career. With a capacity for do-
ing the wrong thing which amounted to
genius the Government sent his north to
report on the ruins. Wherefore the Govern-
ment, in addition to some hazy remarks about
“development”—the kind without which no
home is complete—proposes no more than
to extend the Territory’s narrow-gauge
(31ft.) line south-east 160 miles from Emun-
galen to Daly Waters. Even this is utterly
wrong, for these reasons:—
It is foolishness to build any more narrow-gauge
lines, especially when the builders are so anxious
for a uniform standard gauge. The fact that
Hughes and Pearce built 54 miles of narrow-
gauge route in the Territory makes the business
none the less foolish. The widening of the line
should begin at once, and from the southern end.
The extension work should also be pushed on from
the southern end. It is insanity to hump material
half-round the continent so that the work may be
done where labor is dearest.
Also, it is a crazy business to build from the north
so that the gap in the line (there must be a gap for
some time) shall be as far south as possible, in-
stead of working from the south and having it as
far north as possible. If an enemy develops when
the work is finished all but the last 100 miles, and
the progress has been from the north, that work will
just shriek to him: “Come before the chance passes!
Come to Darwin, and you will find a railway waiting
to take you to the Ranges, and the Finke River, and
1000 miles into the fertile heart of Australia! The
rolling stock can’t get away, for the other end is a
dead-end, and the enemy can’t reach you unless be
snatches command of the sea, which you won’t
allow.’’ That is the scheme, and it is rotten to
the core.
There is, of course, no doubt as to the reason
why the obvious course of resuming work on
the South-to-North line from the southern
end is not adopted. It would commit any
Government which did it to the honest ful-
filment of the bargain which was made with
South Australia, and those Queensland people
who want to steal the work for the profit
of their State, without paying anything,
would rage at large. Queensland contributes
to the Commonwealth £1,250,000 per annum
less than its fair share on a population basis.
But it has more votes to sell than S.A., and
it has the advantage of a certain “pull” in
N.S.W., for Earle Page’s State is offered
the tail-end of the steal, the diverted
line having one end in the Assistant-Prime
Minister’s State. The proposed steal looks
like a business which would earn the perpe-
trators a moral right to a place in the
Rogues’ Gallery, but there seems to be profit
for political vote-hunters in it.

The One-lunged Soldier.
Fob several years consumptive soldiers, many
if not most of them tlie victims of the
Huns’ gas attacks, have been receiving pen-
sions fortnightly and visiting review Boards
every six months. Whether a pension
is cut or increased it continues to be
a source of anxiety to the recipient. He has
a doubtful security for six months, or until
the Department sees fit to call for another
review, which may happen any time. He is
never surp from one week to another that
he will not be thrown on his own poor re-
sources. Once a man is afflicted with con-
sumption he is handicapped for life. Whether
he is “cured” by open-air treatment or
Spaiilinger’s treatment, or by injections and
inoculations, his lungs will never, can
never, be restored ; and, since lungs are more
essential to life than arms and legs, and the
loss of a lung is as much a permanent dis-
ability as the loss of a limb, the man who
has had T. 8., whether “cured” or not, is
entitled to a permanent pension. Unfor-
tunately a T.B. has no physical advertise-
ment hanging on him ; and apparently what
the public’s eye doesn’t see the politicians’
great heart doesn’t grieve over. Even the
Repatriation Department will not employ
these T.B. cases in its offices or elsewhere ;
and when that Department shudders and re-
fuses to employ them, how can they expect
private firms to do so? If a T.B. manu-
factures goods there is in most States a regu-
lation ordering him to fumigate them ; and
there are a lot of other regulations to harass
him in earning a living. If he takes on a job
of his own he is still handicapped by short-
ness of breath, weakness and heart trouble.
Ever he is looking forward to a “cure” ; but
who can wonder at his terrible fits of de-
pression when he reflects that a hundred
Spahlingers cannot give back to him
his lung tissues or his heart muscles! Why
is a permanent pension refused these men?
Any man who left these shores fit and
came back less fit through wounds, gas, ex-
posure or shell-shock has an indisputable
claim upon his country if only for the rea-
son that he will never again be able to com-
pete on fair terms with his fellows industri-
ally. Most of the afflicted men still alive
have had a pension for four or five years.
Why not give them the satisfaction of know-
ing it is permanent while they live? They
can still be “reviewed” every six months and
segregated if necessary. Few of them would
object to being “reviewed” every three
months, or even three weeks, so long as the re-
viewers were unable to “monkey” with the
dole. It is the everlasting uncertainty and
anxiety 7 that galls and retards progress to-
wards health. The extra demands on the
Treasury in making the allowance perma-
nent would not be great; it might not even
be anything at all when the possible office
economies are taken into account. But
whether it is great or little it ought to be
faced ; and this country will be guilty of a
breach of faith until it is faced.

Other Federal Capitals.
The other day the Federal Works Committee
was on the subject of Canberra —one which
is about as inexhaustible as the conversion
of the Jews or a robust case in British
Chancery. Among the witnesses was Speaker
John Mackey, of the Victorian Parliament :
He spoke in adverse terms of the proposal to trans-
fer the seat of government from a large city to a
remote spot such as Canberra.... He thought the
Parliament, because of its national character, should
sit in a large city, either Melbourne or Sydney. It
was essential that members should be brought in con-
tact with the general public.
Unfortunately Australia does hardly any-
thing the way any other country would do
it. A quarter-century ago no State had the
sense or foresight or enterprise to offer the
Commonwealth a large city to sit in. In
such Federations as Brazil, Argentina,
Uruguay and Mexico the Federal Parliament
sits in the supremely big city; but, then, the
big city (Buenos Aires holds 1,700,000) be-
longs to the Federation, along with some sur-
rounding territory. When the Federal autho-
rity moved in it came as sole possessor,
and the State authority moved out. That
is why the capital of the State of Buenos
Aires is the minor town of Da Plata, just
as in the case of the Brazilian Federation the
capital of the State of Rio de Janeiro is
Nictheroy. Of eourse, 1,700,000 able-bodied
citizens wouldn’t stand being disfranchised ;
but the idea that the citizens of the capital
must be without a vote is only a U.S. freak of
which this country made a servile copy. The
other and commoner and simpler device is
for the Feder'al capital and territory to have
its Representatives and Senators like any
State. But it has no State Government save
such as the Federal authority permits, so
that the Commonwealth may be master in
its own house. Austria, though very new in
the republic business, has also recognised
the point that Australia misses, and has set
up Vienna as a city State. Of course, no
need exists to declare that the supreme Gov-
ernment owns London, Paris or Rome, for
these are not Federal capitals, and there
the supreme Government owns the whole
country. As a general thing, and in an ordi T
nary Commonwealth, the Federal authority
has the right to make railways or grant
concessions for their making. The idea that
it should be dependent on any State for the
use of the State’s mixed train when Federal
legislators want to go home is purely Aus-
tralian. It is characteristic that when this
land imitated the United States fin the
matters of having as the capital a new and
city full of disfranchised
inhabitants, it missed the really interesting
points of the case, which were these :
The Thirteen Original States federated without any
State Government demanding possession of-the capi-
tal. The question was left open.
Later, Virginia, the dominant State and the one
which had borne the chief burden of the war, began
to dictate and make “demands.” But they were curi-
ously unlike the N.S.W. “demands.” It asked that
the Federal territory should be partly in Virginia
and partly in the small adjacent State of Maryland,
and that it should be on the Potomac, so that it
might have an outlet to two States and also a water-
gate. This was arranged. Later, it being consideied
that the Federal area was needlessly extensive, the
Virginian bit was handed back to the State, and so
far as the Federal capital is “in” any State it is in
Maryland. ,
As the price of this concession in the matter ot tne
capital, Virginia, and the Southern States which
backed it, gave way on another point. They surren-
dered their debts to the Commonwealth. Treasurer
Alexander Hamilton was adamant about getting
these debts, holding that a lot of petty authorities
shouldn’t be left to fool with what was, after all, the
credit of the Commonwealth as a whole. Though new
State debts have arisen since Hamilton’s time, they
haven’t been on anything like the Australian scale.
But, as already mentioned, Australia has
ways of its own, and seldom does things alter
tlie manner of other people.
Australia and the U.S.A.
It is really time that Australia, if it isn 1
the seat of a wholly kickable community,
should take some measures with its large
neighbor across the Pacific. Some reasons
for this view are these: —
(1) The U.S. people sell us, in some years,
worth more than they buy from us,
and they always sell us a lot more than they will
buy. All the surplus we make on trade with all
the other countries in the world, and all our gold
output to boot, are at times eaten up by paying for
surplus Yankee goods. Constant tightening of the
U.S. tariff, with no similar tightening of ours,
is making the bad position worse. It is no sin on
the other fellow’s part to bill us, as he did in 1921,
for over £26,000,000 for which he would take
nothing but cash. But it is drivelling weakness
on our part to let him.
(2) The United States man has some high-handed,
off-handed ways which he might correct out of the
natural goodness of his heart, if the matter was
pointed out with the proper instrument. For in-
stance, a perfectly respectable Australian arriving
at a U.S. port with a perfectly good U.S. passport
may be thrown into what is really a gaol for being
“in excess of the quorum.” The quorum provides
that less than 300 Australians may go to the U.S.
per annum to settle, and about 30,000 Italians. The
excess man learns that he is excess by being run in
for being excess.
(3) The latest, of course, is the anti-liquor law,
by which the people on any British ship which
calls for an hour or two at a wayside Yankee port
like Honolulu must get rid of their grog outside
the three-mile limit. Yet no one has the grit to
enact that every U.S. citizen approaching a foreign
shore must throw his revolver overboard outside the
three-mile limit.
All these doings are, of course, quite lawful,
having been made so. And there is no rea-
son why the Australian shouldn’t also do
something lawful, likewise necessary, strenu-
ous, and calculated to advertise this country
more than can be done by 10,000 Trade Com-
missioners. In fact, it would make the name
of Australia, now so little known in George
Washington’s land, a household word there.
One idea is to establish a quorum, not of
imported settlers but of imported goods,
somewhat after this fashion: —
When the Commonwealth’s purchases from the
U.S.A. have, during five successive years, exceeded
its sales to that country by more than 50 per cent..
the Law of the Quorum shall automatically come in
force.
And after that, when, at any time in any year,
the goods received from that country shall equal in
value the goods sent to it in the whole preceding
year, the receipt of goods from said country shall
cease until the next Ist of January, and any more
goods coming to hand will be sent back at the cost
of the person who sent them here, and the person
to whom they are consigned shall not pay for them,
and no action for recovery of the money shall lie,
or be of any use "whatsoever.
That would advertise Australia, and elevate
it enormously in the respect of U.S. people,
as being not the worm it looked. It would
also lend to the opening of hurried negotia-
tions. The U.S. might even allow the
British subject here to travel between two
big sections of his own empire in a British
ship which was permitted to supply its
passengers with a drink at meals, even
though it did make a passing call at a U.S.
island port en route.
Art in Australia.
The collection of Australian art to be hung at
the London Academy in October is not as repre-
sentative of our best men’s work as it ought
to be: some artists on the list should have
been passed by, the quota of others should
have been reduced, and a few absentees who
have done sound work should be represented.
Nevertheless, in view of the difficulties, it is,
perhaps, as representative as it is reasonable
to expect it to be: certainly it is sufficiently
so to afford an excellent opportunity of
making comparisons and examining the
faults, virtues and tendencies of Australian
art. But such discussions of it as have so
far been heard give little sign that the
opportunity has been taken. They have
been mostly of the kind which gives three
cheers for the best known, two for the lesser
and one for everybody else. To judge each
picture by the creed of the school to which
it belongs is the easy way: not only does
it save labor, but the critic who thus panders
to the plea for tolerance of every point of
view also avoids the risk of making enemies.
But that way effects nothing towards finding
what is true in art, and the only real justi-
fication for the critic’s existence lies in a
serious effort to find that. If the critics had
not failed in this, many of the freak schools
which have done art so much harm might
have died at birth or soon after: certainly
it is unlikely that they and the doubtful
schools from which they sprang would have
grown into the serious handicap to art evolu-
tion they are. For it cannot be denied that
much of what is called modern art has
perverted vision to such an extent that the
work of the great masters of painting and
of those who attempt to follow them is too
often given but a cursory glance, being dis-
missed as “mere realism.” It is often even
denied that title because it contains nothing

in the way of deliberately-distorted forms,
ex^Sge rated colors or modified tones: no so-
called joyous quality of paint, no display of
conscious technique or any of the other
equally silly things now too often considered
e | s ential in realistic painting. The tragedy
of it is that the student through his school,
and the layman through the critic, have little
but these things served up to them, in either
a pronounced or a modified form. Hence the
schools show so poor a percentage of students
who are capable of following art. Too
often, indeed, the student is rendered suffi-
ciently illogical to become the possible well-
spring of still another unsound creed; and
the unfortunate layman is cajoled, or mis-
led, into allowing the student complete free-
dom to go on twisting vision more and creat-
ing more confusion. In the turmoil visual truth,
art evolution and normal vision are neglected.
It is a situation that calls for frank criticism
and plain speaking, and it is a misfortune
that in connection with Australian art
«ir Se thin S s have been generally discouraged.
.You have no opinions about art in Austra-
lia, a travelled European declared recently ;
' and you never will have while sincere dis-
cussion is disallowed.” Probably if the
merits and demerits of various brands of
motor-cars were not frankly canvassed, not
half as many people would become interested
in motor-cars, with a corresponding reduction
in sales. Certainly if the free discussion of
the points of racehorses were frowned upon,
not half as many people would have a pound
on the Melbourne Cup. It looks, therefore,
as if not only art but the artist might be
vastly the gainer by the encouragement of
real criticism in place of the non-committal
fudge which now passes for opinion where
pictures are concerned, and for the manu-
facture of which the artists themselves are
mainly responsible, since among many of
them an expression of lack of appreciation
of a picture is taken to .be the equivalent of
an expression of personal hatred of the
painter.
The Law as to Deportation.
“J.E.” on some other aspects of Deportation:
In reply to “J.8.D.” (B. 14/6/’23) I submit that
these things can be overdone i (1) A prostrate
respect for “English law,’’ or what is supposed to be
(2) An idea that “liberty” consists of the
liberty of any bad-mannered, bad-tempered, bad-
countenanced stranger to come here, and stay here
without invitation, and browbeat us, and snarl at
us, and make a disturbance generally; (3) An im-
pression that justice consists not so much of equity
as of the snatching of technical points; (4) A con-
viction that if a person is of a certain race and a
certain religion, and is sufficient of a hoodlum, he
can do no wrong.
It may be, as alleged by “J.8.D.,” that most of
the offences created by the statute under which
O Kelly and O’Flanagan may be deported are “un-
known to English law.” Suppose we leave English
law out of the case, also Roman law, and Roman-
Dutch law, and canonical law, and suppose we have
a try at Australian law. We at least know what it
is. Because England never had a complete and
systematic overhaul of its code there are obsolete
matters in existence there, about deportation and
transportation and boiling alive, that even a pedant
doesn’t take the trouble to know unless he is a
very industrious pedant.
-1 think that, if our law is carefully reviewed,
it Will be found to provide that criticism of the
government of any Dominion or State with a view
to its improvement, even if that involves the estab-
lishment of a wholly new system of government, is
quite legal. We may be always w'rong, but we have
not got to the point of enacting a statute under
which “a speaker or writer might be deported for
speaking against the Soviet Government of Russia”
—this because it is not allowable to advocate “the
overthrow of the Government of any civilised coun-
try.” If “English law” recognised the Soviet
business as a Government and present-day Russia
as civilised, it might be illegal for strangers of an
offensive and vulgar type to try to raise either
money or recruits here with a view to the Soviet’s
overthrow by violence and gory murder. But merely
speaking against it as a concern greatly in need of
improvement would be quite harmless. This nation
is said to be lazy and casual, and to borrow too
much, but it isn’t an absolutely furious -persecutor of
free speech.
“J.8.D.” seems troubled by the dream that unless
we give up the recognised right to deport intruders,
and unless we suffer tamely the insults of any un-
couth outsider, some “Labor Government” may begin
to deport our own people for advocating “lowered
wages or lengthened hours of labor.” If a Labor
Government feels that way I don’t think the most
unmanly or unwomanly grovel we could do before any
truculent visitor would save the situation. I recog-
nise that the Board which considered the case of
O’Kelly and O’Flanagan, wasn’t “sworn,” and
despite my objection to profane language I think
that a pity. I admit that it was appointed by
the Government, but then it could hardly be
appointed by the defendants. It had “no permanency,”
but then a tribunal which is only wanted once in
a blue moon can hardly be permanent, and draw its
pay all the time. As “J.8.D.” truly remarked, it
wasn’t answerable to Parliament—in other words,
it had the noble independence of the High Court,
which I rather regard as a good thing. But in any
case it was only a court of investigation, with power
to report but not to pass any sentence, so it all
seems a monstrous fuss about nothing.
Nobody, I think, could avoid agreeing with
“J.8.D.” and with Dicey and Voltaire that it is a
great thing to live in a land where “the laws might
be harsh, but where men were ruled by law and not
by caprice.’’ Therefore I think it blessed that if the
Irish “envoys” go out they will go in strict accord-
ance with law and not caprice. And it will be a
standing law and not one capriciously made to meet
their case.
As a final point “J.8.D.” explains that the
“envoys” have two charges against them —one of
sedition, which I suppose carries imprisonment, and
one of being imported nuisances, which carries a
free saloon passage home. As their outlaw leader
has given up the fight they were going home in
any ease, sooner or later. They can’t defend them-
selves against the tragedy of the free saloon passage
without “disclosing” their defence on the
other matter, and it seems that it would be “the
violation of a constitutional principle of even greater
importance” than anything else if this happened.
I have heard so much, principally in connection with
people of the O’Kelly and O’Flanagan type, about
tilings being unconstitutional (i.e., contrary to the Brit-
ish Constitution) that I sent a rush order to every
wholesale bookseller I knew of for a copy of he
document. To my surprise I learned that there was
no such document and never had been. Still' I admit
that it may be a drawback for an accused person
to “disclose” his defence prematurely. It might
TOO MANY BROTHS SPOIL THE COOK.
“Complant is made that the Australian High Commissioner’s social engagements are interfering with
his offictal duties. A recent uccount of Joseph Cook's movements showed him to be in the middle of
an unbroken serles of dinners and fvstive functions.
JEAMES: “Next week's invites to shivoos, sir."
COOK: “ Righto, boy; accept the lot, as usual—tell ’em Oshtralia will be zhere!"
not matter if he had a truthful defence —say, if he
was accused of murder, and his case was that the
corpse was alive and well, and then present in court.
But if it is a tricky, police-court-shark defence which
must be sprung on the judge and jury like a rat-
trap, “disclosure” is to be avoided.
I don’t think the craving for fine and pernicketty
points of law, constitutional or otherwise, is the
highest kind of law, or of justice either. It uses
up time that might be better spent in settling the
Northern territory. But it is a characteristic. I
believe the most remarkable law case in the British
records came from Father O’Flanagan’s land.
Kelly got O’Kelly, the postmaster, to weigh the
letter, and was told that’ 2d. would just carry it.
Kelly put on two penny stamps and posted the letter,
and the recipient was charged for deficient postage.
When Kelly had reimbursed him he went for the
department on two grounds. One was that it was
the weight of the stamps which caused the letter
to be overweight when it aroused suspicion and was
re-weighed, and the Department had no right to
charge for carrying its own stamps. The other was
that the moisture of the stamps probably turned
the scale, and the moisture was never delivered, it
having dried up en route , and become a false pre-
tence, The best legal talent in Ireland was employed
in this ease, but the records were burned when the

exacting high rates.” “Egg producers cold-storing
to keep up rates.” “Poultry-fanners combining to
extort inflated prices.” “Great loss on millions of
eggs exported.” “Australian eggs cheaper in London
than locally”—we have had paragraph upon para-
graph, column upon column, to the same effect
for the last six months. All mere cackle!
The purpose of this publicity-campaign—it is
obviously well organised—is to lead the public to
believe that the two co-operative concerns which are
now handling the bulk of the eggs in N. S.
Wales have conspired to rob the public for the
purpose of enriching themselves and the poultry-
farmers. And, on the “Codlings your friend not
Short-” plan, it is sought to make the public
believe that the commission agents who till recently
did all the manipulation would have had eggs
cheaper for public consumption, and at the same
time, but for the two co-op. “manipulators,” would
have made better returns to the poultry-farmers.
It is only in 1922-23 that this publicity campaign
has been carried out so persistently. In 1921-22
one co-op. concern tried to stabilise the egg
market, and but a few plaints were heard then
from Sussex-street. In 1920-21 there was no co-op.
attempt to protect the egg-farmer ; so • Sussex-street
said nothing at all. In June, 1921, the whole-
sale quote for choice new-laids reached 3s. In
June, 1922, it also touched 3s. The present month
sees it at 2s. Bd. Three .years or so back it was
3s. 3d. So much for the recent inflation!
Now as to export. Without touching on the
question of our being a debtor nation, paying our
interest and for our imports with our products,
it might be noted that Australian meat, butter,
cheese and fruit —fresh, dried and preserved—are
being sold cheaper abroad than locally, and no
howl is being made about the fact. Why, then, the
row about the poultry-farmer assisting to keep the
bailiff out of Australia? Moreover, in 1921-22,
808,849 doz. eggs were exported, and Sussex-street
never whimpered. In 1920-21 some 413,602 doz.
were shipped, and in 1919-20 211,034 doz. These
figures are supplied by the Federal Statistician,
and are for the whole of Australia; but as Sydney
is the main port for the egg trade, the bulk of the
eggs were N.S.W. produce. Admittedly, there has
been a loss 0 n the eggs sold in England this year.
How much is not yet known, nor whether the levy
the majority of poultry-farmers paid will cover it. As
the co-op. cos. have not finalised their accounts,
all the figures quoted are just idle when they are
not malicious cackle.
1 do not know what the at-ship’s-side cost of eggs
exported in 1922-23 was, so I. cannot deal with
that aspect of the question. In 1921-22 the declared
cost was Is,. lOid. ; in 1920-21, 2s. lOd. ; in 1919-20,
Is. Bd. ; and during those years Australian eggs were
fetching well over 30s. the long hundred (10 doz.)
in London. There were some losses and there were
also some gains in those years. The poultry-farmer
never handled the profits, but certainly suffered
the losses. Probably that was why there was no
“dope” campaign for the public’s benefit in those
years. When eggs were exported at Is. Bd. the
fanner got as low as Is. 3d. per doz., less commis-
sion, etc. In 1920-21, when the declared export
price was 2s. 10d., the price net to farmers went
as low as Is. 6d. Who got the margin in those
years? And why did they' not supply the papers
with the details ? Also with harrowing shrieks
about how the public was being robbed? The daily
papers have spread themselves on “supply and
demand” in the course of their tirades on the price
of eggs. Well, on an average, the commercial flock
of fowls will lay thVee times as many eggs in Sept.,
Oct. and Nov. as in March, April and May. If
e SS s are worth Is. 6d. per doz. to the farmer in the
flush season—and with wheat at 7s. a bushel and
pollard and bran at £ll a ton, there is not much
margin of profit at Is. fid.—what ought the price
to be when fowls are laying only one-third as
many eggs l The obvious retort is that the surplus
of the flush season should he used to average the
price in the off-season. This is done, to a certain
extent, else eggs would have been about 4s. 6d.
instead of 3s. of late. In any case the pppers surely
do not object to the poultry-farmer banking (cooi-
storing) his surplus earnings (eggs) as provision
against the days of scarcity. As a matter of fact,
if eggs dropped to Id. a doz. there would be a limit
to the public consumption. To sell them cheap is
to allow speculators (the real manipulators prior
to 1922-23) to buy them up and cold store them —
as they have done in the past, when eggs reached
as much as 3s. 3d. a doz. What a morsel the egg
pool has snapped away from the yapping pack !
As to cold-storage generally, if properly graded
and stored the egg, which nature has provided with
a container that will keep its contents better than
any man-invented contraption will, is the safest and
most nutritive “stored” food available. Butter and
cheese and meat and nine-tenths of the poultry cooked
m Sydney are cold-stored, and nobody " wearies
anybody else with paragraphs and articles wanting
the storers thereof shot as rogues and thieves.
Journalists, lawyers, doctors, street-sweepers and
a lot of other people have organised to stabilise
their earnings, and secure an adequate wage. The
poultry-farmers are not attempting to do a thing
more than that.

“Six-and-Eight” : The flat-rate method of
company taxation cursed by The Bulle-
tin (7/6/’23) provides another means by
which the very wealthy can become tax-
dodgers. For example, if Midas floats his
business into a limited co. he is taxed in
N. S. Wales at the rate of 2s. Gd. in the
i. If he carries on exactly the c ’me busi-
ness in his individual capacity ne pays up
to 6s. Bd. Some plutocrats have been able
to save themselves the trouble of even form-
ing companies. Instead, they have found
cos._ complaisant enough to carry on under-
takings for them under an arrangement
whereby the difference between the company
(2s. 6d.) and the individual tax (up
to 6s. Bd.) is split up on a fifty-fifty basis.
.Nor is the Act relating to the taxation of
company income the only legislation which
is used to avoid payment of taxes. The
N. S. Wales Life Assurance Act of 1902
is employed by tax-dodgers to avoid probate
duties. It is provided that an insurance
policy effected for the benefit of a wife or
children shall not form part of the insured
person’s estate. Thereby a man who is
wealthy and tricky is enabled to convert a
great part of his estate into insurances on
which no probate duty is payable. As the
portion left unconverted is, in many in-
stances, small, it is surprising that the
squeals of the done-in State Treasurer are
not heard from Macquarie-street to Mil-
parinka.
“A.M.F.”: As a business man the Prime
Minister should overhaul the business side
of the Defence Department, particularly that
portion controlled by the Military Board.
Much of the extravagance disclosed by the
Boyal Commission during the latter end of
the war is reappearing. The training of the
Forces has, moreover, developed into a costly
farce, the greater portion of the amount voted
this year being appropriated for the pay of
the Permanent Force staffs, which have at-
tained a ratio of one to every 12 Citizen
Force trainees. _ .A considerable portion of
the small remaining balance is expended in
schools of instruction for officers. These are
frequently conducted at popular seaside re-
sorts (in season) and catered for on a lavish
scale. Huge stores have been erected for
the housing of stoces and waggons received
from overseas, 90 per cent, of the latter
not being worth the cost of freight and
housing. To attempt to use them in a war
emergency would be to invite chaos.

POLITICAL
POINTS
From an okl Parliamentary hand: —
The reason why Bruce wants to close up the
Federal Chambers by Sept. 1 is that a good-sized
group of Nationalists, including Hughes, won’t stand
I’age leading the Reps, while the P.M. goes to
the Imperial Conference. Bruce will either have his
own way or throw up the sponge. Neither wing of
the Coalition wants him to get out of office —just
yet. The next man leading might be a dissolution-
ist, and that wouldn’t do at all.
In urging the Sydney Labor _ Conference
to surrender to Moscow, which it did, Gar-
den and other wordy importations insinu-
ated that the lied Objective was responsible
for Theodore’s victory in Queensland. In
point of fact it ruined his choicest plans for
winning half-a-dozen agrarian seats, on the
capture of which he had set his heart. Thou-
sands of farmers who used to vote. Labor
refused to have anything to do with the
party in its new orientation. Country dele-
gates to the Sydney Labor hullabaloo pro-
tested that the same thing would happen in
X. S. Wales, only more so. They argued
that the restoration of the party to power, in
N. S. Wales and the. Commonwealth, de-
pended upon its regaining the confidence of
the cockies who used to support it, and that
if Theodore couldn’t do the business in
Queensland, with a great reputation for
leadership and an attractive policy of agri-
cultural co-operation, there was no hope for
Dooley, or some other puppet of the city
Reds.’ But the prophets of disaster might
have saved their breath.
The harder the States borrow the harder
they have to tax to make good the deficit
on the “permanent and reproductive” works
which the loans are spent upon. In 1913 the
States owed £295,000,000; and that year
£1 Is. sd. per head of taxation saw them
through. In the next five years they borrowed
£97,000,000 more, and the taxation moved up
to £1 19s. lOd. Then they started the wild-
est jamboree on record, and in the next four
years £115,000,000 was added to their debt.
And the taxation streaked along to corres-
pond, no less £l 4s. lid. per head be-
ing added. Some day the public will realise
that a loan policy is a politicians’ policy—
the politicians buy place and power with it;
the taxpaying ass merely carries the burden
which the policy straps to his shoulders.
The proposal to establish a uniform bank-
ruptcy law looks rather lonesome on the
Bruce-Page political programme. It was
generally assumed that if any Government
resumed, in a piecemeal fashion, the neglected
job of extending the Federal jurisdiction it
would begin -with the urgent marriage and
divorce question. Surely no State wants a
Federal Court to file its schedule in!
Federal Opposition-leader Charlton, mad-
dened by the sight of a Ministerial bench
with himself not on it, rushed in with his
vote' of censure before he had time to accu-
mulate materials, and made a weak showing.
His most vigorous charge was:—
We have thousands of able-bodied men who cannot
get work.... The Government has made no proposal
to meet their case, yet it proposes to spend £lOOO
per head on newcomers.
The “£lOOO per head” was, of course, the
casual shot of a man unaccustomed to
figures; but there certainly are unemployed,
though what the Federal Government can
do for them is another matter. It was re-
cently alleged that there are scores of brick-
layers’ laborers idle in Sydney for lack of
bricklayers that they could brickie for, and
that the importation of real tradesmen would
supply them with work inst.ead of taking it
from them. It was also stated at a public
inquiry that, it being easier to call men brick-
layers than to make them such, the trade
had been so “diluted” with amateurs and
dilettantes that inside 10 years the average
efficiency fell 30 per cent. That meant
worse-paid men, or more costly houses, or
houses that fell down oftener. Charlton
didn’t even hint at a plan for improving these
matters.
CATERING FOE THE BEST PEOPLE.
THE HKSD TO THE NEW ASSISTANTS: “Now, here are your instructions. Never do the
unusual. Avoid making yourselves conspicuous. And he careful to offer our Best
Customers only what they want. Don't intrude. Remember, we are not a
Fitzroy firm!"
From the Public Gallery:—
Bruce has made an impression on others besides
Theodore. Since the session opened, he has revealed
an unsuspected aptitude for telling retort and
self-possession in circumstances that would have
made the late Nationalist leader lose his temper.
Without brilliancy or commanding intellectual
attainments, he has the gift of knowing what he
wants and the knack of getting to it by the direct
route. His Parliamentary manners, even towards
frivolous questioners, are above reproach. His
own party has nil the appearance of solidarity, and
nothing has happened to disturb its harmonious
relations with the Oockies. H. E. Pratten’s return
from Java and Hughes’s reappearance in the House
may liven things up, but on present indications
Bruce will get away to London all right.
When the basis of the Commonwealth
Bank is overhauled—it will be an easier job
now—it ought to be laid down that the in-
stitution shall pay taxes just like any other
trading concern. At present it is exempt;
wherefore it can afford to do things for its
customers which other banks can’t do for
theirs. This means that one lot of taxpayers
are bled that another lot may benefit, be-
cause if all were taxed the taxation could
be less all round. Something may be said
for the non-taxation of State enterprises
when they have a monopoly, as in the case
of the Post Office; but even there the public
will never know what its services are really
costing so long as they don’t have to help
support police and other offices which are
necessary to them. Nothing at all can be
said in favor of their exemption w r here they
are merely trading in competition with tax-
payers.
Probably because they think they see the
writing on the wall for Lawson and his
team, Eggleston (St. Kilda) and Argyle
(Toorak) are pushing into the limelight in
case one of them may be required. Labor
won’t help anybody more conservative than
Lawson into power. If a Radical were
leader Eggleston and Argyle would do very
well as steadying forces, but neither is
acceptable for the No. 1 job.
Dropping into Auckland (M.L.) recently,
Premier Bill Massey was handed an address
testifying to his “wisdom, sound judgment
and foresight” in handling national ques-
tions. VVilliam modestly admitted that he
had exhibited these qualities. No inhar-
monious remarks were made about the gen-
eral election, at. which the Massey party
was mauled so severely that it remains in
office only with the help of old opponents, or
about the Oamaru by-election, in which Bill
intervened with every ounce of his wisdom
and judgment and failed. In Auckland five
out of the nine city and suburban seats are
held by Labor. That wasn’t referred to
either.
“Gadoitcha”: The requests of about a
dozen different deputations which grabbed
the flying coat-tails of Pearce during his
recent flit through Darwin were mostly given
the usual kind of cold storage. His speech
in the Town Hall was punctuated by the
dog-fights that are a feature of Darwin
public meetings, and was largely composed
of ill-chosen tributes to his worth as a poli-
tician and an account of how he won the
war. He said “cotton” a lot, and even men-
tioned the woi’d “railway”; but a day or two
later he motored away via Newcastle Waters
into Queensland. That convinced the Terri-
torians that the construction of the North-
South line by the direct route, as per agree-
ment with South Australia, had no part
whatever in the picnic.
The Lean of the Community are told, gen-
erally with a wink, “Oh, Fat will pay.” But
though Fat does pay for such extravagances
as Theodore’s, Lean doesn’t escape; and
often his contribution is increased far more
than Fat’s. Of every £lO,OOO of the wagers
of “employees” in 1917 Queensland took
£164. By 1920 it took £622. Public ser-
vants’ contributions in the same time went
from £lO3 to £392 per £lO,OOO. For every
£lOO that graziers paid in 1914 they paid
£363 in 1920. For every £lOO “employees”
paid in 1914 they paid £427 in 1920. Not
only is Lean bled f he also has his leg pulled.
Having accepted the Red programme, it
was patently absurd to keep the Red people
out of the Labor party; hence the decision
at the Sydney Conference in favor of adopt-
ing the Communists bodily. A vision ot the
future is that of the New Labor drifting into
Federal power in a period of general mamer-
ence, and the formation of a New Labor
Ministry, including Donald Grant, Yv if/js,
Lambert, Garden and Thomas Walsh the
gentleman who said he had no objection to
Chinese brethren in the Seamen’s Union, and
who might not object to them in the army
either, if useful in suppressing ‘‘counter-re-
volution.” And if it proved that these men,
or others like them, had come to stay ow i n §
to a revised electoral list, or an amended
franchise, or a sliding ballot-box, some people
might begin to wonder whether indifference
in the face of danger is a good thing. But
it may be rather late then.
Melbourne Harbor Trust has agreed to
take over the Williamstown dockyard from
the Federal Government for £150,000.
Holden, the chairman, delights in deals of
this kind. Some of his chickens will come
home to roost, though, if a single Port
Authority is created for Melbourne and Gee-
long, and he has to take charge of affairs
now controlled by the Geelong Trust. He
left that concern just in time to save his
reputation.
“Bildad”: Mention has been made in The
Bulletin of a peculiar trait in the Aus-
tralian character which causes the land to
be full of long-contemplated works on which
paralysis has fallen just because they are
so simple and obvious. The elimination of
the kink or death-trap in Elizabeth-street,
Sydney, is a case in point. Elizabeth-street
could be carried straight through for about
£45,000, But, then, by spending £lOO,OOO
something might be done to preserve the old
double crook. The resulting deadlock is so
intense that it is probable a Home for Incur-
ables will be built instead. It is like the
silly regulation about walking on the left
side of the footpath in the metropolitan area
or part of it. Nobody has the capacity to
enforce it, or the energy to abolish it, so the
dazzed population just walks all over the
shop and bumps hard.
The latest “Quarterly Summary of Aus-
tralian Statistics,” which brings the tale up
to the end of 1922, shows that the Hughes
Government didn’t improve during its last
days in its management of the big estate
which was supposed to be blessed with its
direct control. The figures showed the N.T.
population to be still on the down-grade,
being 3554, or 1298 less than it was five
years earlier. This was one to every 147
sq. miles. Savings-bank deposits dropped
another notch —to £lO 3s. lOd. per inhabi-
tant, or about one-third the Commonwealth
average. With only £36,219 on deposit the
bank doesn’t pay for axle-grease. There
was once £102,348 to credit. The goods
shipped away during the year amounted to
513 tons, or about a ketch-load, which is
why ships don’t trouble to call. The value
of goods shipped abroad during 1922 was
£5036. They were worth 51 times that
amount (£269,000) in the last years of South
Aus. management. Imports are worth more
than twice the value of exports, but they
are paid for out of official salaries, and the
other States pay the salaries. When it is
considered that the Territory has more land
with a rainfall of 30in. and over than any
State bar Queensland, it seems a marvel
how big a wreck a few small men can make.
“J.F.H.” renews an acquaintance:—
Australia’s wordy old friend Tom Mann bobbed up
recently at a conference of unemployed at Coventry,
the place through which Lady Godiva rode clothed
all in chastity. Tom announced himself as a
“Fraternal Delegate of the Red Internationale of
Labor Unions,” and counselled a general strike as
“the only means of bringing the boss-class to its
knees.” He modestly disclaimed any intention of
inciting the wholesale slaughter of capitalists. “All
you need to do is to fold your arms —go to bed if
you like—and in three days the country will be
yaws.” And if there were two lots of fools as
big as the chain-clanker suggests his friends should
be, and if the other lot put their railways, steam-
ships, factories, etc., to bed for two days, then
Mann’s friends would starve. They might even
starve if the managers and directors went to bed.
Millions did in Russia, anyway.
Ball, the N.S.W. Minister who is really
authorised to deal with railways, recently
promised a cross-country line from Rooty
Hill to Thirlmere and Tahmoor, near Syd-
ney, though each place is served by two lines
already. When it is finished the stretch be-
tween Picton will have three parallel lines
almost in sight of each other. Now a new
line from West Wyalong towards Condobolin
is announced. This will make six almost
parallel lines within a hundred miles or so —
or seven, including a fussy little loop down
by Yanco. Meanwhile, Carruthers, the man
who has no authority at all in railway mat-
ters —the envoy who can be disavowed at
any moment —has continued to peregrinate in
the North, assuring the people that they will
get one railway towards the coast by some
unspecified route at some unspecified time
after the next loan is floated. And he affects
to be the most shocked old political frost
on record when people shout “Rats!” What
other animal could they shout?
HOW HE KNEW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At the A.L.P. Conference in Sydney, Mr. Mina-
han, M.L.A., denied that he had ever been expelled
from the Labor movement. On the one occasion
when the executive withdrew its endorsement from
him, and he only appeared as the fifth official candi-
date, the electors responded by putting him at the
top of the poll.
“A delegate: Your money put you there.
“Mr. Minahan: You are a liar.
“A delegate: You’re another 1 I got some of it.”
“False to my principles none ever knew me.
They never drummed me from the Labor fold,
Or from the movement, a la Dooley, threw me.
Even when those who pull the strings grew cold
How little harm their enmity could do me
Was illustrated by the way 1 polled.
What vindication more could I desire?
Was ever triumph more supremely gladsome V”
A Voice: “It was your money did it.” “You’re a
liar!”
A Voice: “Liar yourself! 1 had some.”
“If jealousy and envy could have queered me,
If furtive malice could my ’scutcheon cloud,
My name were Mud. Per contra they endeared me
Unto tile calumny-detesting crowd,
I feel convinced. And when they chaired and
cheered me
Wasn’t it enough to make a fellow proud ?
I licked, for all Macdonell House’s bias,
Oomrades who had more pull, albeit duller.”
A Voice: “Your boodle put you in.” “You Ananias!”
A Voice: “Nix it! I saw the color.”
“Oh, Labor lions, led too oft by asses,
How have I toiled for you from youth to age!
Sheer merit —sterling worth —these are the passes
Have raised me to the Parliamentary stage,
Zeal for the uplift of the toiling masses,
Solicitude for all who earn a wage—
These are the qualities men sense and pause on,
Not fluency or craft, intrigue or pelf.”
A Voice: “Best thank your brass.” “You impudent
Munchausen I”
A Voice: “I touched a bit myself.”

ing £600,000 during the big boom of the
’eighties, was one of the big Yankee’s adver-
tising “stunts.” They abandoned the Aus-
tralian field many years ago, and it is signi-
ficant that their elaborate premises should
pass into the hands of Australian offices
which were small, struggling concerns when
the “gilt-spurred roosters” were crowing.
The National Mutual has acquired the Equit-
able Buildings in Sydney, and a few years
ago the Mercantile Mutual bought the
Mutual Life of New York’s pile in the same
city. So big has the Colonial Mutual grown
that the £280,000 which it has contracted
to pay for its new home represents only 56
p.c. of its jubilee lay-by. It would have
been a much bigger concern had it not lost
some of its early energy, and had some un-
warranted allegations not impeded progress.
New business written is still in smaller
volume than the records of ten to a dozen
years ago; but solid progress is being made.
Here are new Ordinary assurances for a
number of years ;—•

1915 . . 1,298,248 I 1922 . . 2,317,665
During the past 12 months, though 1472
policies assuring £374,897 became claims,
there was an increase of policies from
71,717 to 73,107, and of assurances from
£5,276,467 to £5,607,843. The average per
policy written last year was £320, compared
with £237 10 years ago.
The departmental tables give one view of
the Colonial Mutual’s expansion; here is a
comparison of total premium income only :
1901 ..£313,650 I 1916 ..£594,861

1911 . . 554,714 | 1922 . . 896,943
Interest from investments is now a big con-
tributor to income: last year the net return
(that is, less taxes) was £325,194, and, in-
cluding a few thousands appreciation of secu-
rities which had been bought at a discount,
the aggregate income of the society was only
a few thousands short of 1£ million. This
comparison shows how dearer-money times
have helped (the figures are for the Ordi-
nary branch)

The rate has improved 12s. 7d. since 1914,
and on present Ordinary funds that means
£36,600 or so annual addition to income.
This improvement has had its effect on the
expense rate, but all the improvement shown
isn’t due to that —the society has been actu-
ally handling its business more cheaply than
formerly:—

1916 .. 15 7 0 „ 1922 .. 15 17 1 „
The improvement last year must be viewed
in conjunction with the smaller volume of
new assurances. The plan of allowing 7
p.c. for renewal business and charging the
balance of exes, against new business indi-
cates that £92,658 of first-premiums last
year were won at a cost of £114,250, a new-
business rate of 123 p.c. The new policies
are not being written cheaply; two years
ago, when War Gratuity business w T as help-
ing, the society showed a new-business cost
rate of around 100 p.c., using the same for-
mula for estimating it; but as recently as
1914 it exceeded 150 p.c. Applying another
accepted formula—assuming that new busi-
ness costs 10 times more than old business —
the Colonial Mutual’s renewals cost last year
was 10.3 p.c. : and the first-premium rate 103
p.c., which compares with 12.1 p.c. and 121
p.c. respectively in 1914. Both methods of
calculation are quite arbitrary, and merely
provide a basis for comparison. The figur-
ings indicate that, though assurance, like
every other business, is now more costly to
run, and despite the fierce competition ruling
since the dozens of young offices have been in
the field, the Colonial Mutual has consider-
ably improved its expense rates.
Meanwhile, mortality has been easier than
allowed for in the tables on which premium
rates were based —in 1921, for instance,
losses by death were 79 p.c. of the office ex-
pectancy—and the improved return from in-
vestments has already been noted. So when
actuary and secretary James Fullar esti-
mated the amount required to cover policy-
obligations as at December 31 last, £248,042
of surplus funds were disclosed, £202,272
of it being the year’s “profit” and the balance
the carry-forward from the previous year’s
valuation. The directors are distributing
£181,496, which provides reversionary addi-
tions exceeding £295,000, the bonuses rang-
ing from £5 per £lOO of assurance 45 years
in force to 30s. p.c. for policies five years
in force. When estimating its liabilities
the society assumes that funds in future will
earn only 3* p.c. p.a.: they are now earning
5| p.c. So there is a wide margin, for con-
tingencies in the valuation, and as interest
considerably better than that assumed when
premium rates were fixed is practically
assured for many years, investment earn-
ings will be an important contributor to
future surpluses and bonuses.
The Colonial Mutual’s Accident branch,
though it also pays bonuses —usually a uni-
form addition of 2 p.c. to benefits provided
in policies—is not making rapid progress.
During the past year 727 Life policies also
carried Accident and Sickness risks, and 796
straight-out Accident policies were issued.
Nevertheless, premium income was £5lO less
than for the previous year. Figures for 10
years have been as follows: —

Funds, including £5768 provision for unex-
pired risks, and £11,968 reserve for bonus
additions, amounted to £42,217 at Dec. 31.
An Industrial branch was established only
13 years ago, though it was helped by the
purchase of the old Standard’s business. In-
come has more than doubled in six years, and
now exceeds a quarter-million. Perform-
ances since surpluses recouped the heavy
outlay at the beginning have been as follows:
Industrial Department.
Income. Claims. Expenses. Funds.
1914 .. £97,036 £15,476 £49,623 £19,267
1915 .. 104,807 18,809 48,735 56,530
1916 .. 121,308 15,616 51,245 110,977

1922 . . 251,453 43,962 77,718 744,410
Besides the mutual principle applying to
Industrial operations, the society has also
made concessions to policy-holders, and they
have no doubt helped business-getting. Some
of the customary forfeiture provisions were
made easier, and for the past two years the
society has employed a nurse to advise sick
policy-holders. Another innovation, which
cost £2009 last year, is a “welfare” scheme,
under which good advice is given to policy-
holders. It also, no doubt, is payable pro-
paganda. The department paid its first
bonuses last year, and now, the actuary
having decided that the £744,410 of funds
at December 31 were £35,081 in excess of
a valuation which has been tightened up,
£24,302 is being taken to provide reversion-
ary bonuses ranging from- 30s. to 11s. 3d.
p.c. on the sum assured. These bonuses are
50 p.c. better than last year’s.
The Colonial Mutual, like most other Life
offices, has adopted a policy of “safety first”
with its investments since interest-rates on
Government securities improved. For many
years mortgages headed the lists. Of the
latest balance-sheet total of £6,681,808 more
than 4* millions (67.8 p.c.) were in public
securities, and only £713,074 (10.7 p.c.) was
loaned on mortgage. The book value of pre-
mises at December 31 was £645,442 (10
p.c.), but that item will be increased by the
purchase of the new Melbourne headquarters.

After two lean years Castle Salt’s distribu-
tions to shareholders have been restored to
normal, the 8f p.c. on bonus-increased capi-
tal giving almost as much as 10 p.c. did
formerly. But the margin of surplus profit
visible after providing for depreciation of
leaseholds is trifling. The co. would have
been in much sounder condition had the
directors not transferred £9150 in 1920, for
reserves are now only £326 in credit, and
that is in a “dividend and depreciations
adjustment account.” Conditions have im-
proved a good deal. The latest harvesting,
which provided the stocks for the current
year’s trading, was fairly satisfactory, and
a few of the adverse market conditions which
affected profit-earning for several years have
improved: price-fixing by Governments has
been abandoned, and the hides and meat-
canning industries are recovering from the
after-war depression.
This comparison of the liquid position
shows the recovery the co. has made—

liabilities at the latest balance were smaller
than for many years, and the qo.’s affairs
generally had become more comfortable. But
the actual balance-sheet position—and, inci-
dentally, the current year’s profit-earning—
depends entirely on how stock valuations
stand in relation to markets.

Since the March, 1922, accounts were issued
the co.’s interests have doubled: in addition
to the Sydney and Newcastle dailies, a
morning News Pictorial and an evening
daily have been introduced to Melbourne.
The former had been running during six
months of the financial year, but the other
made its appearance a few days after the
latest accounts closed. Whether Melbourne
activities affected profits is not disclosed;
but probably the subsidiary co. has carried
most, if not all, preliminary and establish-
ment costs there. The two new dailies are
run by Sun Newspaper (Melbourne), Ltd.,
to which the public (including a number of
Sydney co. shareholders) subscribed £lOO,OOO
in 8 p.c. £1 prefs. which participate with
ordinaries up to 10 p.c. The 150,000 of ordi-
nary shares are held by the parent co. Pre-
sumably the subsidiary will publish accounts
later on. But balance-sheet figures in a case
of this kind are not of supreme importance,
everything depends on the extent to which a
co. can employ its plant and organisation.
In Sydney Sun Newspapers has been aston-
ishingly successful: it has done so well that,
though its shareholders subscribed £107,350
of new capital during the past 12 months
to finance Melbourne interests, divS. of 10
p.c. on the face-value (£1) of scrip were
paid. Three years ago three shares paid to
17s. 6d. each were allotted for every £1 fully-
paid held previously, the new scrip being
provided by writing up assets and giving
goodwill a book value of £245,633. The
shares have since been paid up to 18s., and
last year’s 10 p.c. divs. were equal to 11 1-9
p.c, on paid capital. The year’s good profits
were the more remarkable in view of the
directors’ gloomy forecast, in their 1922
report, that conditions then “made impractic-
able” any reduction of the selling price of
l*d. if shareholders were to receive a “reason-
able return.” Two months later, others hav-
ing taken the lead, week-day issues were sell
ing at a penny. Evidently a larger circula-
tion and better returns from advertising
provided full compensation. The accounts
closed with £33,666 in excess of the div. dis-
tributions. Incidentally, £15,042 of the
£22,000 put into a contingency account at the
1921 balance disappeared during the past 12
months.
A comparison of recent balance-sheet
figures follows:
1919. 1921. 1922. 1923.

Melbourne co. . 61,496 69,753
Goodwill . . 245,633 217,633 215,000
Of £670.230 of capital £174,045 is represented
by the excess of goodwill over and above re-
serves and P. and L. balance. Of course,
there may also be intangible assets in the
Melbourne co. affecting the representation
for capital. Generally, the balance-sheet is
not informative: premises and plant in Syd-
ney and Newcastle are detailed: but the en
tries “Melbourne expenditure, on account of
Melbourne co., £69,753” and “Investments,
Sydney. £152,476” are vague. The co. is
proceeding with extensive additions to pre-
mises and plant in Sydney, and as only
£2279 of cash showed up in March, it is not
clear how financing is being arranged. What
is clear is that the N. S. Wales business is
turning in splendid profits which may prove
very helpful if the southern enterprise lags.
The directors announce that the pictorial
daily was “an immediate success”; the even-
ing paper “promises to be a success.” In
the Melbourne Herald the Sun has a for-
midable and wealthy competitor, but though
editor Monty Grover’s invasion of his home-
city may not be so spontaneous a success as
his Sydney pioneering, there should be few
doubts about the future.

Paid capital is £96,443. and at March 31
outside debts totted up £385. The total book
value of assets was £157,926, so the accounts
suggested that the co.’s belongings exceeded
capital and liabilities by £61,098, instead of
the £22,460 shown in the table. But the
figurings for the table do not take into
account £37,888 in a “capital reserve” and
£750 set aside for taxation. The “capital
reserve” represents some of the hot-air which
was pumped into the movie business by
’Murkan J. D. Williams when he effected
the amalgamation of interests in the Gen-
eral Film Co. West’s is represented in that
concern by £86,536 of shares, £10,400 of
debentures and an advance of £4OOO. Instead
of watering its own capital to correspond
with written-up interests in the combine, this
co. and Amalgamated Pictures, of Mel-
bourne, wisely treated the difference as a
“reserve.” Evidently West’s directors re-
cently decided that this account should be
further fortified: during the year it was
increased by £1026, probably the profit from
the sale of a city leasehold disposed of at
a “satisfactory figure.” This addition has
not been taken into account when reckon-
ing up the year’s profits. The improvement
on the previous year is accounted for by a
distribution from the General Film Co.,
which has been an erratic div.-payer. The
principal sources of income are the co.’s own
leasehold and freehold properties, and they
don’t appear to be so remunerative as they
used to be. Here is a 10-years’ comparison
of balance-sheet figures :
1913. 1921. 1922. 1923.
Liabilities.. ..£34,777 £6,332 £5,852 £385
Freeholds, plant, etc. 30,034 32,475 32,472 32,470

Book debts & cash 5,797 11,862 10,947 16,212
The proceeds of the sale qf property last
year went into short-call loans. Apart from
holdings in the General Film, the co. at
March 31 showed liquid assets £15,727 in
excess of liabilities. Properties stood in the
books at £40,777. That left almost £40,000
of paid capital to be covered by the £100,936
of General Film shares, debentures and
advance. What those interests are worth
cannot be guessed. This much is clear: a
lot of glitter has disappeared from the movie
business, owing chiefly to circumstances over
which Australian distributors and showmen
have had no control. But West’s, not hav-
ing placed any capital value on the boom
froth, has paid a fair average rate of
div. since it reconstructed 13 years ago, and
has meanwhile strengthened its position a
good deal with surplus profits.

The Importance of Tight Valves
Boiler Blow-off service is the most difficult of any required of valves.
Further, the slightest leak at the blow-off valve means continuous money
loss. The valve which does not leak soon pays for itself, whatever the
cost, and thereafter earns daily dividends for you.

GUARANTEE.
The knowledge of what the Everlasting Valve has done warrants us in
giving this guarantee:
Should any regular Everlasting Valve in boiler blow-off use develop a leak, and not give perfect continuous service
for TWO YEARS after installation, it will be repaired or replaced without charge, or money refunded, as buyer may choose.
In addition to Blow-off Service, the Patent, Leak-proof, Everlasting Valve is unequalled for any service where a straight-through passage is
required. It is made for quick or slow opening ahd closing, and in any kind of metal.
Our valve hook cannot fail to interest you.

GUTHRIDGE LIMITED, 10 George Street, Gamperdown (City), Sydney
The Barrier has increased its labor team
to about 5000 employees. Lead prices have
been well maintained, considering that the
Ruhr argument has meant a cessation ot
demand from Germany. The price of zinc
is not of much interest to Broken Hill at
nresent excepting to those cos. having an
interest in Electrolytic Zinc. The Broken
Hill production of zinc concentrate is sold
for years ahead at a fixed price.
North B. H. jogs along with an output of
15 000 to 16,000 tons crudes monthly. With
high-grade ore, tiptop metallurgy and low
costs the mine is doing excellent work.
On the 1550 ft. level good progress is being
made driving for the lode, and results should
be looked for in five or six weeks. Accord-
ing to Geologist Andrews the lode should
be got, and the development work is expected
to add well over a million tons to ore
reserves. < .
The B. H. South is pushing on with the
erection of its new zinc plant. The slime
plant is already producing and helping re-
venue. Increased output may be looked for
when the complete plant is ready.
Zinc Corp. is mining about 15,000 tons
monthly from the South Blocks. The old
dump-treatment plant is being pulled down,
and a new crude-ore mill is being built in
its place. Two of the staff, Freeman and
Sloan, have accompanied George Klug to
London to help in the investigation work on
the new Elmore process.
Of the smaller fry, Block 10 is wearing
a down-at-heels look, and will probably not
work long unless lead prices leap upward. At
present it is in pawn to the Smelters’ group.
The few remnants of low-grade stuff remain-
ing—probably aggregating not more than
100,000 tons of “extractable” ore —might
yield more profit if sold to either of the
adjoining cos. Junction North is hopeful of its
new roasting process for oxidised material,
and will be in position to give it a fly
shortly. Meanwhile, rumor is persistent at
the- Hill that Melbourne interests have not
lost hope of amalgamation or absorption of
some shows, particularly on the north end.
The grouping of several of these mines would
be advantageous.
• * * *
The prospects of a new coalfield being
opened up on the N. S. Wales main-southern
railway have advanced another stage: efforts
are to be made at an early date to form a
co. to establish a first colliery. In 1914
Coal, Ltd., proved the Bulli seam to be <Sft.
3in. thick, and of excellent quality, at Appin.
A few months ago drilling at Douglas Bark,
2f miles from the Appin bore, ran Bft. 10in.
of first-class fuel at 1687 ft., and lately an-
other bore a mile north proved Bft. 7in.,
free of bands, at 1794 ft. On a conservative
basis, 250 million tons should be available
within three miles of the railway. The open-
ing up of the seams will be costly, but there
should eventually be good markets for the
field. A soundly-developed colliery would
have excellent prospects of competing fbr
the southern trade against the more distant
and older mines whose working faces are
three to four miles in from their hauling
shafts. Anyway, the development of the
field is of more than local importance; it
would probably assure an industrial future
for some of the languishing southern towns.
The effect of the recent rise in tin is
shown by Great Britain, Emmaville
(N.S.W.). For the half-year ended April,
1922, there was a debit balance of £1464;
six months later it had been reduced to
£948; for the term ended April last there
was a net profit, of £2087, leaving £lOB9
available. Three divs. of Is. each absorbed
£l5OO, and a debit balance of £4ll was car-
ried forward. Another Is. div. has since
been paid. The production of both plants
for the half-year was 58 tons oxide, which
realised £132 per ton, as against the previous
half’s average of £lOB. Back Creek, in the
township, on which the main plant is work-
ing, has been quite a surprise as to values,
giving the richest ground the _ co. has
had to treat in its 15 years’ life. The
mine is still being worked on tribute.
*** * /
Hampton Celebration (W.A.) has raised
sufficient funds to remodel its treatment
plant and to go deeper. Hopes are enter-
tained of better prospects, but it seems too
much to expect that the lode, which lost
most of its gold at 50ft. from the surface,
and, save for one or two short lengths, _ is
unpayable down to and at 300 ft., will im-
prove at depth. Anyhow, that was the
experience with every other ore-body worked
on the Hampton field.
* * * ■*
Another attempt—there have been several
failures—is about to be made to work por-
tion of the old Fraser’s group at Southern
Cross (W.A.). This time the Government
is advancing £5OO to unwater Fraser’s Cen-
tral shaft, and a local syndicate reckons it
can do the rest. Between 1890 and 1897 the
group produced more than £750,000 of gold,
and paid a big sum in divs. Deepest work-
ings are at about 500 ft., where the ground
is hard, and values known to exist there
would be barely payable under present con-
ditions. But there may be better —or worse.

Arsenic is in better demand in the
West, and Perth and Kalgoorlie promoters
are talking of the fortunes that lie in sev-
eral long-abandoned goldmines at Randalls
and elsewhere. Some ore at Randalls, a few
miles from the Trans, line, goes 40 p.c.

Last week the “Wild Cat” credited the
Ives Reward co. as the option-holder of
Brown’s Reward, Yalgoo (W.A.). Of
course, it was Lass o’ Gowrie which took
over Brown’s. The Ives has never been in-
terested in Yalgoo; it has had its hands
full with its own show on the Ives.

New Langi Logan, Ararat (Vic.), half-
yearly report is one of pleasant anticipations.
It is true that equally optimistic reports
have been distributed by the co. in the past
and that performances have failed to liVe up
to them, but in this instance bulk tests have
given results which induce the directors to
forecast “the likelihood of early and profit-
able extraction.” The report states definitely
that there is no longer any water difliculty
to hamper operations. The extreme southern
wash-drive is in 4oz. ground; and there is
2000 ft. between this point and the boundary.
The report indicates that the main reef-drive
is some distance ahead of the wash-drive,
and that bores are being put up to drain the
ground. Omission from the report of any
statement as to what prospects have been re-
vealed by these bores may or may not be sig-
nificant. A simple official report on the point
would remove a suggested doubt.

“Optic”: Bill Toole will not work out
the fathomage at New Langi Logan. Alec
Peacock says the mine has a block 600 ft.
by 250 ft., and he announces that 133 fathoms
of it went over 40z., the dirt coming from
wash-drives. But he, too, shies off calculat-
ing that 600 ft. bv 250 ft. gives only 4200
fathoms. Most of the best gold has been
got west of No. 1 rise, where several of the
drives were left in 6£oz. dirt. This rich
stuff seems to be making towards the west
bank, so Toole has shoved a rise up off a
west branch reef-drive. If he draws a blank,
or only moderate-grade dirt, things will
crack. Results at No. 3 rise, lower down
the gutter, give the key to this bit of work.
Toole drove out west only to get wash
almost to the floor of the drive; it then
flitted overhead for 200 ft., but has now got
back on to a dead level, with better values
making, a 4oz. sampling showing up in time
for the annual powwow. Such irregularity
shows the Langi gutter to be ais patchy as
ever, though the runs of gold are better than
higher up in the lead. They need to be,
for £185,772 stands at the debit of working
account and £14,500 at the debit of plant
account. The co. owes its banker and others
£6BOO, while £l4OO has been lifted out of
the Treasurer’s till since the books closed.
* * * *
Biplane, Harrietville (Vic.), from the
315 ft. and 440 ft. levels, has been averaging
only 6dwt. Seemingly the rich quartz got in
the winze at 240 ft. was a patch even smaller
than the general run of Harrietville makes.
Geologist Kenny put his lens on the show,
but he can’t explain why so well-defined a
shoot should fade. A short crosscut at
315 ft. south will soon disclose all he wants
to, know, but it won’t land the co. high in
the list of fatmen shows —the shoot of gold
is too short. Nevertheless, Allen Bowler still
forecasts “a lengthened period of pros-
perity.”
Daylesford (Vic.) still does its best.
Ajax is on a good market wicket; shares
are bottled up, and the bears are being
squeezed dry. All the good stone lies above
No. 6 level, with most of the crush-dirt com-
ing from the stopes over it aiffi No. 4 level.
Hansen's prospecting programme at Ajax
North is costly, and as the big makes of
stone at Nos. 7 and 8 levels were not of
pay quality, development is eating into
yields.
Ajax South ran into 2ft. of quartz in the
shaft with the usual Ballarat boost. No-
thing payable has been got so far any dis-
tance from the big mine. Nevertheless, it
is good prospecting. Meanwhile, the two
Rising Sun mines only await a show of
colors in the famous Daylesford mixture to
give them their flutter. That’s what makes
Daylesford such a fascinator.
“Bendigonian” discusses serious matters:
When I wrote last (B. 7/6/’23) to point out that
market manipulators were likely to Co harm to
the field, I little dreamt that we were on the
verge of a debacle which is perhaps without par-
allel- in our history. It is no use mincing words:
what has happened in connection with the New
Blue during the past month will mean disaster unless
there he some speedy solution of the mystery.
To assume that the bottom is out of the mine
would be to cast serious reflections on two honored
names : —manager R. O’Brien and chairman G. W.
Lansell. In the half-yearly report published in
February, the manager was definiteness itself: “We
have large reserves of payable ore opened up both
on the sandstone and slate veins which insure large
outputs for several years.” The chairman was no
less emphatic; “The resources of the mine are of
great magnitude.... and may reasonably be expected
to provide profitable employment for years to come.”
The work done since has been mostly developmental
so that the “resources of great magnitude” ought
to have increased. I therefore dismiss the sugges-
tion that the drop in value of shares from 455. to
15s. in five or six weeks is justified by any marked
change in mine prospects.
Spec-sellers are not likely to be responsible for the
downfall. “Once bitten twice shy” may apply to them,
and they got a hammering for the raid which they
made on the stock 18 months ago. The only pos-
sible explanation seems to me to be that there has
been a well-devised bear attack —bears in this con-
nection being totally distinct from spec-sellers. It
may be very simple to organise a syndicate to man-
oeuvre market operations by persistently selling stock
at ever-lowering rates, thus creating a funk, of which
they take advantage—the modus operandi being to
sell, say, 500 shares (and have a great fuss made
about it) from 255. to 155., meanwhile having con-
federates at work to pick up the thousands that
frightened holders will throw on to the market. To
sell 600 and buy 5000 in this way may be clever,
but it may also be despicable. The directors are
open to severe censure. The drift has been allowed
to proceed now for several weeks without the utter-
ance of a single official word of explanation. An
air of assumed indifference and the mere assertion
that the mine will beat the market will not meet
the circumstances. . What about the protection of
honest shareholders’ interests? They surely have a
right to be warned, or advised, against the tactics
of unscrupulous manipulators. The management
should not delay to take measures which will put
beyond doubt the real position of the mine.
* * * *
As foreshadowed by Premier Theodore, the
State has taken over the Mt. Mulligan col-
liery and coking plant from the Chillagoe
Co. The recent strike put the co. behind
just at the critical moment when coke-pro-
duction was starting. Mines-Minister Jones
has been anxious to get control of the mine,
as it should assure a regular supply of fuel
for the Chillagoe smelters. The co. had
a contract for these supplies, but was not
able to fulfil them. Mulligan coal is
high in ash, but has good steaming quali-
ties, and washing enables a good coke to be
turned out.
* * * *
A co. has been formed to w T ork the Brook-
field (Q.) claims, chiefly the Eclipse No. 1
and No. 2 and the Surprise. Payable reefs
have been proved to exist, but geologist St.
Smith gives Eclipse No. 2 the palm, and the
co., acting on his advice, will start off on
it by sinking a winze and looking for other
veins by crosscuts. Present plans are to
spend £6OO or £7OO on this work, and pro-
duction from the rich pyrites vein, which
has assayed up to 510 z., will help. Then,
if funds are available, it is proposed to sink
on the No. 1 Eclipse. The Surprise group
also offers inducements for development. The
amount available for prospecting work is
small considering the prices paid for interests
in the syndicate: up to £3OO and £350 for a
twentieth share.

J. W. Hetherington, of the Blair Athol
(Q.), having seen the open-cut nearly com-
pleted, is packing his bag with samples, and
is making for the Far North and Canada
seeking orders. He is satisfied that there is
a future for Blair Athol, as the fuel will
stand handling, and, judged by high calorific
standards, is a pretty good steaming coal.
There are so many State-owned collieries
producing nowadays that the only chance
for Private Enterprise is an export market.

A protest from the Speck :
The Carbide Co. at Electrona has had to close
down as a result of competition from the importa-
tion of surplus stocks of foreign carbide. Metallurgist
J. H. Gillies, the founder of the industry and the
driving power behind the development of the Great
Lake power-scheme, has had a might}' struggle
against adverse circumstances, and it is now possible
that he will lose the results of a life’s work, and
that an Australian industry will be strangled, be-
cause of the indifference of Federal Ministers.
When the co. commenced operations, it expected
to raise further capital from time to time as work
proceeded, but it was soon in difficulties, and ap-
proached the Tas. Government for assistance. This
was refused, but after two years’ negotiations the
Labor Government succeeded in persuading Parlia-
ment to purchase the power works from the co. and
contracted to supply it with power with which to
carry bn its proposed metallurgical activities. Car-
bide works were started and the output of first-class
carbide was commenced. Then another difficulty
arose: an adequate supply of carbon electrodes was
unprocurable during the war; but Gillies met the
trouble by manufacturing his own. The co. got going
again, but it had lost a good portion of the period
of war prices.
After the war, foreign manufacturers commenced
to dump their surplus stocks on the Australian
market, and the industry was again held up. The
duty of £7 per ton was altogether inadequate, and
the Federal Government was prevailed upon to place
an embargo on the importation of carbide, the co.
agreeing to a maximum charge. This embargo per-
mitted the co. to carry on successfully, and consumers
were being supplied at prices not much above pre-
war level. But with a change of Government the
embargo has been discontinued, and again the foreign
article is on the market at a price which just under-
sells the local product.
The Gillies co. has now been squeezed out of
business after valiantly duplicating its works to
enable it to meet the full requirements of Australia.
Prime Minister Bruce refuses to lift a finger to
save the industry from extinction. He regards an
embargo as a serious matter; though he has since
readily consented to protect the Queensland sugar
industry and others by embargoes.
The destruction of the industry is a serious matter
for Tasmania. The Government has advanced the
co. more than £90,000; it has spent £15,000 in
a transmission line to the works ; while the receipts
for power sold are about £15,000 p.a., and would be
increased by £7500 with the works operating at
full capacity. But all these facts here had not the
slightest influence on Mr. Bruce. The assistance
sought could have been afforded without one penny
cost to the Federal Treasury or to consumers. Cer-
tainly the latter are at present getting cheaper car-
bide; but that is due wholly to abnormal conditions
in the world’s carbide markets. Later on, the Com-
monwealth will pay dearly for its carbide if the
foreigner succeeds in killing the local industry.

Austral Malay’s prospecting staff has
completed the probing of the area
(Lower Burma 1, 30 acres being added there-
by to the 000 already proved to average

put into possession without delay: mean-
while Austral Malay directors are planning

The gradual decadence of the gold-mining
industry is shown by the production of the

pared with those of the same period for the
two preceding years :

The improvement in Queensland is attribut-
able to the resumption of work by Mt.
Morgan. Victoria has improved slightly on
last year as the result of better yields from
one Bendigo mine. The steady retrogres-
sion there is remarkable considering the
liberality of the Government in granting
assistance. The industry is now sustained
by three mines; Blue (Bendigo), Ajax
(Daylesford) and Morning Star (Woods
Point).

WIMBLE'S INKS”
•‘The Deacon” : The bush still produces its
gruesome tragedies. Lately a cripple—one
arm was useless and both legs nearly so—
sat down in the scrub to light bis pipe.
Holding the box between his knees he struck
the match with his good hand. Somehow he
set himself alight, and being unable to roll on
the ground he hobbled off to an adjacent
svaterhole. But a barb-wire fence stood in
the way, and the unfortunate cripple got
hopelessly hung up in it. There he slowly
and thoroughly roasted to death. Chance
help came just at the end, and the lucid
brain in the one minute that remained gave
a clear account of the horror.
“Wilfrido”: A constable at Timaru
(M.L.) met his man coming from a hotel
late at night and inquired whether he was
a member of the staff. “No,” said the per-
son questioned, “I’m a lodger.” “Is your
name on the books?” asked the cop. The
other said he didn’t know whether it was or
not. “Well, if it isn’t,” said the cop, “I’ll
arrest yon.” The two repaired to the pub,
where the books revealed no sign of the re-
quired name amongst those of the holders
of rooms. “Well,” said the owner of it at
last, just as the proprietor hove in sight,
“they must have missed it out this week.
You see, I’ve been living here for over 80
years!”
SAVING THE COUNTRY.
“The head said we’d got to economise—especially on
stamps. So we’ve cut out the postage on city
and suburban letters and deliver ’em by taxi.”
"Bohnock”: “M.T.” (B. 7/6/’23) reminds
me. Two years ago, in a busy N.S.W. North
Coast post-office, I was making a final clear-
ance of the letter-box at close-up time, when
I noticed an envelope drop into the box and
mysteriously disappear. With my noble
band of understrappers I crawled underneath
the building and found the letter —with about
500 others. Investigation disclosed that any
letter, unless pushed forward, was liable to
slide through an almost imperceptible aper-
ture at the bottom of the box. To those m
supreme command the writer suggests a
circular to postmasters calling upon them to
make a periodical inspection of all mail re-
ceptacles.
“Pitt Streeter’s” vignette at Kirribilli: —
A large man beamingly approached him and
exclaimed, “How d’ye do, Mr. Hughes, I have not
seen you for” “Hey - ?” said Billy, putting a
hand to his ear. Slightly taken aback, the other
remarked again in a louder key, “I was saying.
Mr. Hughes,- that I haven’t seen you .since”
“Hey?” said Billy in a voice that made everybody
on the rapidly-filling wharf jump. The large citizen
was already beginning to look uncomfortable and
newcomers were asking in startled whispers “What’s
up ?” The large man pulled himself together and
made another attempt. “I was just saying, Mr.
Hughes,” he roared, “that you and I haven’t met
since” “Hey?” said Billy in a fortissimo that
rose above the crash of the incoming ferry-boat.
The corpulent person did not wait. He turned
wildly, dashed through the crowd, and hurled his
avoirdupois aboard. Smiling sadly the honorable
member for North Sydney obeyed the ferry-hand’s
injunction to “Hurry on, please,” and the gang-
plank clattered ashore.

“H.S.” on an outbreak of Jazz Charity:—
The artists of N. S, Wales had the odd experi-
ence the other day of being told that they and
their women-folk are untit to run an artists’ ball.
Except for one or two painters, the crowd that
volunteered for the enterprise of saving the artists
from themselves by taking over the control of their
ball were almost entirely in what may be called
oi>r K.B.E. class—-the most philistine and anti-
Australian class, as a whole, in the Commonwealth.
Special measures are to be taken to “exclude un-
desirables,” and by a diligent process of deodorisa-
tion it is hoped that this ball may be both “help-
fur to sweet charity and free from the objectionable
features of other artists’ dances.” The, artists know
well. that \the average big artists’ ball is not in it
for unseemliness with, say, a really fruity Picnic Race
Club ball. Rich Sydney women do not, however, offer
to take over the organisation of Race Club balls
and keep them free of undesirables, for one thing
because they would .receive a severe knock-back
from the Club authorities if they did, but chiefly
because the enterprise would not promise an adequate
recompense in advertisement.

"Cartot” : In the 14tli century one of the
popular methods of treating small-pox was
to isolate the patient and hang
red curtains around him, to. the
exclusion of all natural light.
It seems to have, been vaguely
supposed that there was some-
thing in the treatment that shut
out malignant influences,
although the reputed inventor,
one John of Gaddesden, Court
physician to Edward 11. dur-
ing the Black Death, left no
monograph on the subject.
Centuries ago the idea of a
cure being effected by such
methods was discarded as a
preposterous superstition; but
now a Paris specialist has
arrived with the announcement
that, whereas the chemical rays
of daylight, if allowed to fail
on a small-pox patient, will
make him worse, the pernicious
effect being greater as the spec-
trum-scale is ascended, the
lower colors have the exactly
opposite effect, red, the lowest
of them all, being of great aid
in treating the disease. The
same authority insists that a
patient, given ordinary treat-
ment., and with only red rays
of light permitted to fall on
him, will recover in about a
ouarter or a fifth of the time
that would otherwise be taken.
It is believed that the organ-
ism to which the disease is due
has its growth and potency in-
hibited by the rays at the bot-
tom of the spectrum ; this has
been proved beyond doubt in
the case of several other patho-
genic bacteria. Those old
chaps of the Middle Ages knew
more than we credit them with: this isn’t
the first instance of one of their remedies,
purely empirical as they may appeal - , being
proved perfectly sound.

thing through!” The faithful transmitter
sent out this intro., and the musical item
followed. Among subsequent acknowledg-
ments came one from a warship in the
harbor: “We liked the song, but the pro-
logue was better!”
“Umfaan”: For 25 long and exciting
years Mike Dolan and Peter Dunn had been
enemies. There was no quiet malignancy
about Mike or Peter—it took a large section
of worried neighbors to keep them from
homicide if the two Dungaree spud-growers
happened to visit the township on the same
day. No one knew the origin of the bitter
feud, but as the years rolled on it assumed
the proportions of an Iliad. Then a while
back Peter was arristed on a little matter
of sheepskins found in his barn with Some

body else’s mark on ’em,-bad-cess to ut. On
the day of the trial Peter was challenging
the jury when—holy -wars!—Mike Dolan’s
name was called. Before Peter had quite
recovered from the 'shock of his old enemy
being on the jury, the said enemy, unchal-
lenged, and surprised at it, was seated in
the box. Evidence over, the Judge summed
up and" the jury retired. As soon as the
door was closed Mike took off his coat, rolled

used ’it as a pillow, remarking, “Yous lads

stir Mike. He was completely indifferent.
An hour two hours, three, dragged by. Most
of the jurors had cows to milk or little one-
man businesses ito attend to. Money was
talking even if Mike was silent, so finally
the foreman led his 11 into the court. “Not

Ten minutes later in the nearest pub Mike

vored to butt him into insensibility. It took

“Aeon”: A little salesgirl in our (Syd
ney) place has just got her first real lesson
in the danger of jumping to conclusions. An
important customer dropped in. She was
large and loud-voiced, but her banking-
account was more of both. “I must take
more care of myself now,” said she, viewing
her ample form in the mirror. “A woman
can’t take really good care of herself when
she has a husband who wants her at every
turn, and never thinks she can do enough;
but I'm going to make d change now I’m
alone.” “Oh, Mrs. g” said the sales-
child with an appropriate expression of the
deepest sympathy, “we did not know of your
loss. And he always looked so well, too;
“Looked far too well!” snapped the customer.
“He’s cleared out to America with the par-
lormaid.”
* * * *
“Clinton”: During the early days of the
war, when the officers and crews of enemy
ships were interned, many a good dog was
shot because it was unfortunate enough to
be owned by a German. Being imported
animals, they couldn’t be landed without quar-
antine, and the Government naturally .jibbed
at meeting the cost of this and their subse-
quent upkeep. A few escaped by being given
to the masters of vessels bound for foreign
ports. A splendid Newfoundland dog. whicn
was credited with having saved three peopie
from drowning, was handed over to the
master of a Norwegian sailing vessel which
cleared Newcastle for a South American
port. There was no one more gratified at
his escape than the official charged with
supervising the massacre.
"Hamer”: Sydney is to have another
“Chase” —a somewhat high-sounding title,
presumably intended to denote a plaice wheie
nothing may be pursued except happiness and
nature-study. It is to perch along the shores
of tJpper Middle Harbor, where 2000 acres
of Crown lands are to be thrown into a
reservation. The place will be a great deal
more accessible than Kuringai Chase, whose
beauties are doubtfully known to one Sydney-
ite in a hundred. The new Chase, like
Kuringai, is to have an aboriginal rock-
pool and some white native-bears. At all
events the surveyors who were delimiting the
boundaries of the Chase lately came upon
some of the latter fauna —a rarity anywhere
in Australia.
“Eight-and-Four”: A very fine point <»l
law has led to an Adelaide woman being
penalised for her good-nature. Several years
ago, S.A. came to the conclusion that women
are not necessary or even appropriate as bar-
tenders, and passed an Act for the gradual
abolition of barmaids. Those already em-
ployed were registered and allowed to go
on, but no new ones were to be admitted
to the vocation. However, a licensee could,
and can, always get his wife or daughter to
help at the bar; a mother was not mentioned,
perhaps by intention or perhaps by over-
sight. In the present case a lady who her-
self runs a city hotel went to see her son,
who runs a suburban one. While there she
lent a hand with the trade, as if she were
at home—and was promptly charged, and
fined, as an unregistered barmaid.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The swirling leaves in a panic fly,
The cloud battalions are torn and thinned,
For down the sky goes thund’ring by
With plunge and cry a galloping wind.
The streaming branches crackle and snap,
The tiles go flying from stricken roofs,
The windows slap and rattle and clap
At the sudden rap of his racing hoot's
Drumming a measure of wild delight,
A ringing, clamorous jubilee;
Where’er they smite in their headlong flight
The foam flies white from the churning sea.
And high o’er the smother of dust and spray
The clarion call of his whinny shrills
Its fierce affray, as he takes his way
To the winds that neigh from the inland hills.

“Te Bnbarantiko”: The last time I saw
Herbert Maitland was at Easter. In an
ancient suit with ttousers to the knees and
one shin badly “barked,” he was oft the Nel-
son’s Bay jetty, Port Stephens, while the
auxiliary fishing-boat he favored was taking
on board paraphernalia for a trip. And he
told me this yarn. Seated on a rock he had
fished for two hours without getting a bite.
A little further along an urchin dropped in
his line and hauled out a three-pounder.
“What kind of a fish was that you caught,
sonny?” asked Maitland. “I don’t know for
sure,” replied the kid, “but this gentleman”
—indicating one alongside—“says it’s a
blasted miracle.”

“Country Ped.”: The Vic. Education De-
partment has signified its approval of the
movement for installing gramophones and
cinema machines in country schools, pro-
vided the local authorities will raise the
necessary funds. But how can it seriously
expect the parents in the general run of
small country schools, which average less
PROFIT AND LOSS.

broke off your engagement with him.”
“Yes. I made a mistake, and sent him

than 20 pupils, to raise the money? And
these are the very schools where such ad-
juncts are most needed. As a way out ot
the difficulty some of the schools have formed
groups to buy the necessary outfits. I sug-
gest that the' idea is capable of further ex-
tension. Why shouldn’t the department it-
self group the schools ? Many of the little
ones could be cut out, and the children con-
centrated in a central school, being con-
veyed from more remote districts by sub-
sidised motor-vans, as is done in Canada.
The central institution could be maintained
at less expense than half-a-dozen small
schools, and —more important still —be
staffed by efficient teachers, permanent and
visiting, thus giving the country children
the same benefits as are now received by
town children. With such a school in each
country community, all district efforts for
the benefit of the children would be co-
ordinated ; the parents of 100 children would
be able to provide the very necessary extra
appurtenances that a Government should not
be asked, to provide.
“FORTY LOVE .”
“I say, I'm awfully sorry—I forgot all about your party last night .”
“Oh, weren’t you there?”
“Lex’s” Counsel of Perfection: —
The Judge who presided over the Howland v.
Howland divorce suit in Sydney began his summing-
up last Thursday with the remark that it had been
conducted by the lawyers on both sides “according
to the best traditions of the legal profession.” He
may have meant that it was not disfigured by boorish
truculence. And, again, the seeming compliment may
have been a subtle insult. The Court s time, for
Which the public pays, had been occupied for 11
days to no useful purpose: and the case had cost
the parties over £3OOO, and landed them nowhere.
The only tangible results are that a number of mem-
bers of the profession have been made considerably
richer, while at least three families have been dis-
rupted in fact, while remaining joined in law. How
much more admirable it would have been if the oppos-
ing lawyers had come together at an early stage.
One impressive expert might have been deputed
whether he was a barrister or a solicitor would have
been immaterial provided he had the right peisou-
ality—to tell the parties the truth about themselves.
Stripped of that camouflage which ■ diplomacy de-
mands, the gist of his advice would have been this:
“You have all acted in such a way that a jury will
be bound to find against you. If you fight the case
the odds are 100 to 1 on that the lot of you will
be branded as liars and ruined financially into the
bargain. My suggestion is that you meet, and in
your own interests, and more particularly those of
your children, arrange a collusive suit. The ques-
tion as to which party shall ‘carry the baby’ might
be decided by lot, or by an arbitrator, who . would
also decide what form the suit shall take.” One
of the reasons why this act of Christian charity is
never performed is that any barrister oi solicitor
who undertook it would risk being disbarred or
struck off the rolls. And yet it is almost as obvious
a deed of humanity as that performed by one who
saves a momentarily demented fellow-citizen from
drowning himself.

“O.F.II.”: Melbourne officialdom is dis-
cussing a proposal to continue • shops and
offices along Wellington-parade South as an
eastern extension of Flinders-street When
the Collingw.ood railway, now (electrified,
was run (in a cutting) through the reserve
in the centre of the parade, it spoilt the place
as a beauty-spot. The strip that remained
on the south (Jolimont) side has been dis-
figured by the erection of wooden buildings,
used for various purposes by the Common-
wealth. It is suggested that by selling tins
strip a tidy lump would be available tor
making the Treasury Gardens presentable
and finishing oft the improvement ot tne
Fitzroy Gardens. A bill was pushed througu
Parliament authorising a worse thing the
disinterment of the bones of the pioneers
in West Melbourne Cemetery to enable
Paddy’s Market to be extended. Given a
line of shops on the reserve strip, and it is
all Swanston-street to a half-acre block at
Croajingalong that Clapp will lease a simi-
lar strip for another row on the railway
frontage, which includes the old Cast Mel
bourne Cricket Oval.

“Vandorian”: Rupert Bunny, the com-
fortably circumstanced Australian painter
long settled in Europe, has been stalking
scenery in the South of France. A roman-
ticist, he rarely cares to snare the dun
grey tones of Northern Europe, though
think he painted an interior of St. Paul’s
(London) in the midst of November’s fall-
ing smuts. That Avas two or three years
ago. He has four things in the Salon which
opened its exclusive portals on May 1.
Writing to me of his recent southern trip,
he says: “I did a lot of work, and hope to
send more things to Australia in a couple
of years. The Societe Nationale and the
Artistes Frangais, the latter the old Salon,
are breaking away from tradition and open-
ing the same day. Everything is so expen-
sive, and it costs less to have it all in one.’
As to the general conditions of art in Paris,
one picks up a few crumbs. There has been
a great rumpus, mainly because of a dean-
set having at last been made against the
new (or comparatively new) school of
“jazz” painters. “The fact is,” says Bunny,
“the struggle for life amongst the rank anc
file of artists here is getting very bitter, and
the dealers, or some of them, encourage the
stupid and ignorant sort of work which
floods the market, thus making big profits
out of unknowns, who are delighted to sell
a canvas for 10 or 15 francs —say, four
or five shillings, English money.” Inciden-
tally, two of Bunny’s pictures in the Salon
are in a religious vein—Mary and the infant
Christ, and St. John.

“Cyrano”: The nuisance and scandal of
senseless and offensive buffoonery by ’Var-
sity students in public disgraces M.L. cities,
as well as Sydney (B. 24/5/’23). The sight
of students presenting these tenth-rate vau-
deville shows in the garish noon amid a guf-
fawing crowd, and imagining they are amus-
ing, must cost our ’Varsities many possible
students. In Christchurch the other day one
of the exhibitions was given in the middle
of the impressive jubilee celebrations of Can-
terbury College. Larrikin undergrads, pub-
licly parodied religious services, and, scantily
dressed, sought to play the fool with any

“Stellsby”: “Silent contempt.” cited by
“Winkle” (B. 31/5/’23), should be effaced
from the army and navy crime-list. In
the hands of an unprincipled officer it is a
weapon for tyranny and spite against which
there is no adequate protection. I have seen
ratings crimed for “silent contempt ’ without
the slightest provocation. Junior officers,
who are more concerned about their dignity
than an Admiral of the Fleet, are prone to
put a man “in the report” for looking side-
ways upon nothing. In tlje army “silent con-
tempt” may not incur serious punishment,
but in the R.N. it often culminates in a long
stoppage of grog and leave. It may even
mean cells for the unfortunate Nobby, who
has at some time or other perhaps grinned
at an affected “haw” from a cub Nelson.

“Spare Corp”: The muddlement of the
War Service Homes Department has been
the worst feature of Repatriation m Aus-
tralia and now the Department is charging
the muddle to the soldiers who have secured
shacks. In many cases ex-soldiers were forced
to accept the plans and specifications, of the
Department, on the plea that their own
plans would exceed the amount grantable
(£800). Often enough the Department ex-
fieded its own £BOO limit; now the ex-soldiers
re being billed with the excess, and, natu-
rally, are kicking. One of the Departments
expensive methods was to provide material
IN TURNS.
“I can’t make you out. One minute you are
gay, and the next as sad as can be.”
“I am in half-mourning, you know.”
and bargain with contractors for labor in
the erection of the houses. It was not an
altogether unnatural result of this method
that material mysteriously disappeared from
allotments where houses were building. I
know of one locality where a contractor had
three places to build and four houses have
gone up—the last on a block belonging to
the contractor. Quite all right, perhaps ; but
you should hear what some people say about it.
THE WORD-BREAKERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Out of the gracious morning, full of the laughter
of birds,
He came to the sorrowful valley where thought was
broken in words,
Words that were moulted of meaning and lost to
their old renown
In the jangle of ceaseless speaking that was life in
the faded town.
A town —it had meant a hedge-row, that word in the
great green days;
But they made it to mean a desert of brick for
their folly’s praise.
And the smoke was thick in the sunset and a black
grime edged the sea;
But they boasted their dungeon’s greatness and
claimed that their lives were free.
free —it had spoken of kinship, that word when its
sound was young.
The free were the world’s strong children of the
world’s strong manhood sprung;
But here where they boasted freedom they thought
not of friend or mate,
But of foes that were ever with them to call forth
a holy hate.
H o ly—it meant but. healthy, that word in the long
ago;
Something akin to the sweetness of the great clean
airs that blow,
Something afar from the loathing where the lame
and the maimed words mix,
Where the town lies sick in the palsy of gossip
between the bricks.
Gossip—Ah, shrill backbiters, what right to the
word have you ?
Are ye sib to God or each other in aught that ye
say or do ?
He stood in the sorrowful valley of moulting and
wounded words,
Then turned again to the silence and the chatter
of leaves and birds.

Melbourne’s ex-Mayor David Ilennessy,
who died suddenly of bronchial pneumonia
at the week-end, continued to be somebody
after he had ceased to wear the bunny-skin.
His aldermanship freed him from facing the
electors, and he had heaps of time (he re-
tired from business in 1889) for his com-
mendable hobby—the public gardens. The
latest job he took over was the chairman-
ship of the Botanic Gardens committee. Two
decades ago Hennessy was in the Leg. Assem-
bly as member for Carlton South. He was
not a good speaker, but managed to get
through without boring anybody or tread-
ing on people’s corns. George Reid, when hi*s
guest at one feast, described him as ‘‘Thret*
Star” —an allusion which all but the water-
drinkers enjoyed.
Alongside this is the best Perceval can do
with Syd Shipway, whose name was a sine
qua non, or a ne
[j lu s u Itra, or
something of the
sort, on Sydney
concert pro-
grammes 20 years
ago. He was a
humorist then, but
is cast for a
heavier role these
days, and in his
spare time main-
tains his connec-
tion with the fra-
ternity of the foot-
lights by secretary-
ing Ye Idlers’ Club.
Many a sick
inmate of many an
institution in and
around Sydney will
give the best imita-
tion he can of three
Aussie cheers when
the name of this
organiser of bright
shows on their be-
half is mentioned.
Although he has
lapsed into un-
broken suburban
respectability, he
occasiona 1 1 y
emerges to invite an audience to ‘“lift the
roof off,” because, as he generally explains,
it isn’t his—or theirs.
Vie. Labor-leader G. M. Prendergast is
putting up a record of waiting for another
turn on the Treasury benches. Nearly 10
years ago he was for 13 days Chief Sec. under
the late George Elmslie —and that is the
one bright spot in his long career: he has
been barking at the Government steadily
since 1904. He is now ageing at the busi-
ness, but his moustaches are still trucu-
lently waxed and his eyes still look confi-
dently for the miracle —it can only be a
miracle —that will pitch him into power
again.
A Gallery-man’s note :
One who will look with baleful eye on the
coming scrimmages in the Reps, is W. Watson, the
Independent member for Fremantle. Now 59, and
with the mournful honor of having two sons killed
on the same day in the war, Watson hasn’t lost
the spirit that about 40 years ago drove him to
issue a pamphlet against party politics. It was a
youth’s expansive screed, muddy in expression but
full of sagacity, and the veteran still fondly re-
members the stir it made. He was living in
Gastlemaine then, but later went to Westralia,
where he has built up a big business, with his
third son as chief-of-staff. A kindly, engaging
character with an energetic sec. toddling ever in
his wake, Watson is bound to make his voice
heard as the days go on, particularly over the party
manoeuvring that smudges present-day politics.
He would head the Ayes with a brass band on any
motion for Elective Ministries.
The late W. A. McArthur, of Sydney,
whose death was reported in last Bulletin,
fought what is probably the closest election
on record when he had his first shot for the
House of Commons. This was in 1886, when
he stood as a Gladstonian Liberal for the
Buckrose division of Yorkshire and beat
the late Christopher Sykes, a local magnate
and a’close personal friend of the then
Prince of Wales, by one vote in a poll of
7483. On a recount, however, the seat went
to Sykes. In 1887 McArthur was elected
for a Cornwall division, and sat until 1908.
“Old Banker”: A man who will be dis-
cussed when it comes to appointing either
a Governor of the Commonwealth Bank or a
Board of Manage-
ment is Mark
Baker Young. He
is the chief inspec-
tor and a well-
salted banker. In
the old Colonial
Bank he was an
inspector, and from
that got the job qf
manager in Mel-
bourne when the
0 o in monw e a 11 h
Bank was born,
Afterwards he man-
aged the Sydney
branch, then was
lifted to his pre-
sent job. Young
has just returned
from a world’s tour
after having repre-
sented Australia at
the Pan - Pacific
Banking and Com-
mercial Conference.
He is still in the
early fifties.
TED YATES,
Labor M.H.R. for
Adelaide.
“Uramao”: Massey, of Maoriland, whose
hold on the reins of power is precarious, will
nevertheless attend the Imperial Conference
if lie can come to an understanding with the
Liberal leader. Should the trip come off, he
will be the only Prime Minister in attend-
ance who also was present at the previous
Imperial talk. Of all the heads of the
Allied Governments who helped to draw up
the Versailles peace terms, Big Bill is the
lone survivor—the last rose of summer left
blooming alone.
“Biltong” : A. G. Yewen, who passed out
at 66 the other day, was one of the quietest-
voiced, most self-effacing and lovable men
in Sydney, and for years had been telling
S. M. Herald readers about the price of
wool and stock; yet in the days of his warm-
blooded youth, away back when young Hoi-
man and Hughes were first looked upon as
dangerous socialists by Fat, Yewen was the
reddest of Reds. He edited the hectic and
long-since-defunct New Order, apd the
story goes that at a big banquet in the Town
Hall, whereat the Employer sat in buik,
Yewen suddenly appeared, stalked solemnly
round the board and placed the lurid pamphlet
before each guest. By the time he had
worked back to the door the collective mouth
of the party was sagging in the paralysis of
amazement. Then Yewen struck a dramatic
attitude, waggled a long, lean finger at a
wall quite innocent of writing, yelled, “Mene,
Tekel, Upharsin !” —and vanished.
“The Deacon” : From the very beginning
of the N.S.W. Labor upheaval months back
one inexplicable feature has been the uncom-
promising hostility of Mrs. Kate Dwyer to-
wards her former idol, “Sunny Jim” Dooley.
She carried it with her through Conference
to the bitter end. Knowing that his women’s
following is the one body of Dooley’s sup-
porters which has never let him down, dele-
gates were at jiains to find out the reason of
this defection and antagonism. But all they
could do in the end was to wonder what
would have happened if Dooley had sent one
or two women, including Mrs. Dwyer, to
the Leg. Council.
Gone nearer to the stars he loved, Murray
Leith Allen, a disciple of Inclement
Wragge. Born in England in 1843, and
coming to Australia as a young man, he re-
signed a good job in the N.S.W. Education
Department to join the erratic meteorologist.
He was assistant in the observatory which
Wragge established on Mount Kosciusko—
where, by the bye, poet Bernard Ingleby was
also on the staff. Allen became a ’Varsity
coach later, but for the last 10 years was a
very sick man.
M. P. Hynes had three tries for Parlia-
ment before he broke into the Bananaland
legislature the other day. Twice he failed
to dislodge E. B. Swayne (Country party)
from Mirani, and last December he ran second
to F. W. Bamford, M.H.R., in Herbert. On
May 12 he defeated W. H. Green, Mayor of
Townsville, and deputy-leader of the United
party. The reshuffle of seats favored the
Labor man, and Fate and the Redistribution
Commissioners ironically excluded Green’s
own house from the Townsville electorate.
Hynes, who was born in Mackay, has been
horse-breaker, “gun” cane-cutter, navvy,
wharf-lumper and union organiser and sec-
retary. Although only 38 he is as grey as
a badger, scales 16 stone and owns a voice
that would out-rumble an empty tramcar.
His dad was one time Mayor of Mackay.
and his mother, at present living in Sydney,
was the first white girl born in the district—
under a dray on Connor’s Range.
The grave has closed over Charles Yeo,
once a well-known figure in Northern Vic.,
who had got to within five years of his cen-
tury. In the middle ’eighties he was in the
Assembly for one Parliament, but afterwards
was content to be a member of the Council of
Agricultural Education and such like. Founder
of the auctioneering firm of Ydo, Taverner and
Co., he in his palmy days nlade the welkin
ring from Swan Hill to Bendigo. A likeable
old man.
Amongst the leading stock-and-station
agents in Melbourne half-a-century ago were
Ryan and Hammond. The former was the
father of Dr. “Plevna” Ryan and of Marian
Ellis Rowan, Australia’s most gifted flower-
painter. Hammond’s son is Rev. R. B. S.
Hammond, the prohibition apostle, who has
been wearing a dog-collar since 1894. Bishop
Field Flowers Goe, of pious memory, was
the cleric’s anti-liquor godfather.
Gone to a closer view of the stars, P. J.
O’Connor, who was one of the members for
Fitzroy in Vic. Assembly early this cen-
tury, after Best went to the Federal Par-
liament. He served the same locality as a
municipal councillor in the periods he could
spare from his land-agency business and his
star-gazing hobby. Two wives preceded him
to the other side.
R. .1. Noble, the ex-N.S.W. school-inspec-
tor’s son who was handed the Ben Fuller
agricultural scholarship in 1921, is doing well
at the Minnesota ’Varsity (U.S.A.), where
he has been investigating flag-smut in
wheat. The scholarship peters out this
month, but the Dean of his College of Agri-
culture has sent a special request for an exten-
sion to enable Noble to finish a research job
on which he is engaged.
Arthur Merrin has been appointed Vic.
Sec. for Mines, but will continue to be Chief
Inspector of Mines and Boilers and con-
troller of the brown-coal mine run by his
Department. He will, however, have to
throw up his lecturership at the ’Varsity; so
the net result of his lift will be about £125
a year—and the added dignity.
Whatever happens to the income-taxing
authority the name of W. 11. Whiddon shpuld
cease to worry the N.S.W. ’payers after
October, when its owner will touch 65 and
be due for retirement. The prospect of a
change in system may, howqVer, induce the
Government to retain him until the new
order has been settled.
M. L. Hall, of the Union Bank, who died
suddenly in Adelaide the other day at 62,
was in the old Bank of S.A. before the
Union absorbed it. He put in seven years at
Broken Hill in its palmy days, and was an
inspector for Vic. and the Speck later,"but
for the past 15 years had been in Adelaide.
“Tay Pay”: Donald Grant has been a
thick-and-thin supporter of Father O’Flana-
gan in Sydney. The twain have been much
together on the platform and at the Commu -
nist citadel in Sussex-street, and the strange
companionship has caused a flutter even in
circles in sympathy with the Sinn Fein
ecclesiastic. One is a professed Christian
priest; the other an atheist whose most bitter
gibes were reserved for religion and its
preachers. But that was in his I.W.W.
days. We may yet see Dr. Mannix joining
forces with John Ness in the creation of a
Mohammedan College run by Buddhist
priests.
Alleged to be the last of the once great
I-lawkesbury River tribe, old Tom Dillon
left Newcastle Hospital for the Happy Hunt-
ing-grounds recently. Pie claimed to be
close on 100, and though he spent the greater
part of his life in the valley of the Hunter,
like most Binghis he sought the shelter of
the abo. reserve at the finish. A fall into
a fire brought about his end.
Vic. Parliament now houses five knights—
Peacock, McPherson, Mackey, Robinson and
Manifold. Mackey and Manifold, like Flora
MacFlimsey, of Madison-square, have nothing
to wear on nights of festivities. They have
no stars or ribbons like the other three. Gaud
May or Swanson
will be in the same
terrible plight
when he gets oft' the
civic throne in No-
vember, but for the
present his fur-
edged robes, cocked-
hat and weighty
gold chain serve.
Still, there’s no
saying ho w far
they’ll all descend
before they finish.
Irvine, for in-
stance, can deco-
rate himself with
an amazing array
of_ gold lace and
things—and he was
a plain mister a
few years ago.
E. TURNBULL,
Vic. State presi-
dent (and acting-
Federal President)
of the R. S. A.,
who is “having
wards” with Prime
Minister Bruce.
“8.E.” : Died at Stavvell (Vic.) “Doctor”
Charles Lum, known throughout the Wim-
rnera as a herbalist. Lum made a good deal
of money, and handed it out again in a way
that makes many of our so-called public-
spirited men look cheap. He was tit), and had
Put in 49 years in Australia: he had been a
telegraph linesman and an engine-driver in
the N. Territory before he took a trip to
China about the time of the Boxer rising,
after which he blossomed out as a herbalist.
The old Celestial was fond of the gee-gees,
and always seemed to have the “oil.”
H. L. Brown, who was the other day ap-
pointed Sydney manager of a combination of
motor-agencies, brought to Australia the
‘ tank” which was subsequently used to
gather money for war funds and to boost
war loans. The capacity he showed during
the Big Scrap in regard to war-like mdtors
landed him into some responsible jobs,
among them being the training of Americans
in the use of armored cars. With the war
over, he was promptly snapped up by a
motor firm.
“S.S.” : Sydney acquires another Adelaide
artist, W. A. F. Seppelt, of the new school
of portrait-painters. He has been one of
the very few in S. Aus. to venture on the
more ambitious type of picture, which con-
tains a number of figures. He has a lot to
learn yet in technique, but his “Lying in
State of Ross Smith” shows that he has
vision as well as ambition.
“ILK.” : A recent par. about Mick Consi-
dine, ex-M.11.R., toiling at the Victoria Dock
recalls that when ex-Senator Harry Turley
put up for South Brisbane, in the early
’nineties, he went to the polling-booth, re-
corded his vote, and returned to his job
wharf-laboring. Despite his election, next
morning he was down at work as usual.
The boss called out: “Will the honorable
member for South Brisbane move that bag
of spuds?” “Aye, aye, sir,” responded Tur-
ley, and the motion was carried!
“Sucre”: “H.N.” (B. 7/6/’23) is right
m saying that T. J. Ryan owed his
sound interpretation of constitutional law
to McCawley and Macrossan. But it was
dapper barrister Jimmy Blair, now a Dis-
trict Court Judge, who pulled McCawley
off a clerk’s stool in the Justice Department
and showed him the track to the Chief Jus-
tice’s seat. Blair was then Attorney-Gen-
eral. Now the ex-clerk numbers his old
boss among his staff on the Bench. Verily
the psalmist was right when lie said the
roster of to-day is the feather-duster of to-
morrow.
When in 1921 James Wilkinson Whyte,
who died the other day, ceased to be Recorder
of Titles in Tasmania and retired, he handed
over no less than seven other jobs—he was,
as well, Collector of Stamp Duties, Regis-
trar of Public Trusts, member of the Civil
Service Board, trustee of the Agri-
cultural Bank of Tas., and various other
things. Whyte had a sound knowledge of
finance, and on property law he was rec-
koned b.v the profession to be the Speck’s
best. His father was Premier of the island
from 1863 till 1866.
“Cinquante Neuvieme”: Another din-
kum padre (B. 31/5/’23) was Rentoul, of
Pompey’s Brigade. In the ’l6-’l7 winter on
the Somme he had a soup-kitchen at the
head of Bull-lane, above Flers, well remem-
bered by all who knew that sector. In spite
of being blown out he stuck to it, and one night
heard a Digger, while supping a milk-tin of
appetising soup, size him up so: “Well, the
padre’s not such a bad poor old blankard,
after all, to stick up here when he could
he back in a deepy!”
HIGH TREASON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is never a mortal that treads the earth
But is doomed to woe;
He has either an income beneatli his worth
Or a corn-cursed toe,
He has either a collar that chafes his chin
Or a load on his mind,
Or lie backs sure winners that fail to win
Or wakes to find
His appendix must suffer an unkind cut.
But —
His Rotten Luck and his Operation
Are the light and joy of his conversation.
There’s a crumpled roseleaf, so they say,
In the brightest lot:
Poor Matthew’s wife has run away,
Poor Mark’s has not.
And not one of the millions of humankind
But is “misunderstood.”
The doubts of his fine, supersensitive mind,
His intentions so good,
Fate brushes aside with a cold “Tut-tut!”
But —
The Mate of Matilda, the Knight of the Garter
Enjoy nothing better than being a martyr.
There are times when grief has a certain zest
For the lone and lorn,
And we’re all of us prone to “lean our breast
Up till a thorn” ;
There is never a blessing we love to nurse
Like a grievance dire,
There’s a curious pride when things get worse
And the gods conspire
To fashion our metal with blow on blow.
So —
Though our troubles are sore and we dare not flout
them,
Whatever on earth would we do without themf
victoria.

“Allbutt”: I’ll give “Azac’s” giraffe (B.
24/5/’23) as much start as he wants and race him
with a few emus of my acquaintance. On the
N.S.W. Western Plains, where Fraser’s racers get
loose and scoot along at 60 an hour, the emu doesn’t
have to exert himself to keep level, not only for
the first mile, but for many of them. A few years
ago out Moree way one particular bird used to
race the mail-train every day, and would run across
the line in front of the engine, wait till the last
carriage had passed him, then, coming round the
other side, put on an extra spurt and cross in front
of the engine a few hundred yards further up. I
know the train crew used to try their dam’dest to
beat him, as I was one of them; but he was too
good.
* * * :Jc
“Jimmy Possum”: I don’t know about a
bloke chopping his head off; but I did know a
German, a good-tempered, taciturn old chap, who
nearly knocked his napper off with a maul one
lay. He was belting into a tough log while I kept
time with the broad-axe. Suddenly the business-
end of the maul flew off, struck against a tree
20ft. up, rebounded, and bumped Christie on the
back of the head, knocking the wonder out of him.
A SCREAM.
“George! George! Wake up! I heard it again!”
"Oh, go to sleep. It's only the beastly wallpaper.”
After a while he picked himself up, felt his bump,
and then looked at me. “By cripes,” he said,
as I stood grinning at him, “nearly I say some-
tinks.”
“Lofty”: Re “Condamine’s” yarn (B.
31/5/’23) about the prad and the flooded creek. The
night the 1902 drought broke the old man and my-
self were camped on the wrong side of the ’Bidgee.
At daylight we decided to hit the track “at the
Soot,” and on arrival at the crossing found it to be
jbout 80yds. wide (in normal times about 25) and
running very strongly. There was a bridge about
six miles up, but the old man decided to give the
crossing a go. We were driving two 13-hand ponies
—mountain bred and tough as nails —in a heavy
buggy loaded with all our camp gear and instru-
ments (the old man was a C.E.). The crossing was
always dangerous, and had been responsible for the
death of five bushmen. Everything went well for
the first 20yds.; then suddenly we found that all but
the ponies’ ears and mighty little of ourselves had
disappeared under water. It was a case of get across
or drown, there being no chance of turning. The
old man shouted encouragingly to the ponies, and
they responded gamely. Then for about 40yds. we
saw only their ears and occasionally their snouts
when they tossed their heads for a breath. Thanks
to them we got through with the loss of only a
bucket and some language on the part of the old
man. The facts of this episode stick in my head
chiefly because, on arrival home, mum poured a stiff
glass of grog down my neck —my very first.
“Wai-ite”: Looking through a copy of
Pears’ Encyclopedia I learned that the eucalyptus
is “a gum-tree which, in some cases, has been known
to grow from 480 to 500 feet high.” Can anyone tell
me where I can see one of the 500 ft. saplings?
“Baro”: I don’t agree with “Monaro” (B.
31/5/’23) that the greyhound is speedier than the
horse. In such trials as have been made the horse
has always been handicapped with weight. It is
difficult to see how they can be matched on equal
terms. The Romans used to race horses without
riders, but their methods would not be allowed to-
day—especially by the S.P.C.A. The prads were
made to extend themselves through fear, like a dog
with a tin tied to his tail, only with the horse the
scaring contraptions were attached to the flanks. My
money for the Animal Speed Stakes goes on the
gazelle and the giraffe, which have been timed to
attain speeds of 60 and 70 miles an hour respec-
tively. The gazelle certainly looks the goods; but
who that has seen a giraffe trotting in a Zoo
enclosure, its legs flopping about as though they
belonged to somebody in the next street, would
suspect it of possessing such speed?
* * * *
“Orion”: I can back up “Early Bird” (B.
31/5/’23) re his lady-shearers at Torah (N.S.W.).as
I happen to know the place. But as workers they
can’t beat three girls I know near Bidgerebong, a
small settlement down the Lachlan from Forbes
(N.S.W.). The father had a sudden heart seizure
which left him unfit for the heavy farmwork, and,
the only son being useless, the three daughters deter-
mined to see it through. Under dad’s tuition they
learned to handle the team of six draught horses
and a four-furrow plough as well as he ever did.
Stackbuilding and driving the harvester were all
mastered in good time. When I last saw the place
it was as well kept and as profitable as any man-run
farm in the district.
* -if * *
“L 36”: Let “W.D.G.” (B. 3/5/’23) be
told that herbage is the natural' food of the shell-
back or blue-tongue lizard. “W.D.G.’s” reptile may
have developed a taste for kangaroo, but although he is
endowed with remarkable speed for about 843yds.
the advantage is a little bit on the side of the
’roo. Further, the scaly chap isn’t equipped with
the prongs necessary for the climbing to enable
him to prey on sleeping birds or rob their nests,
so his only hope is to eat something that stops
right where it is on the ground.
* * * *
“Booyong” : “Yarrum’s” par. (B. 24/5/’23)
re spearing ducks recalls to my mind one of the big-
gest hauls of ducks I’ve heard of. An estuary at
Mandurah (W.A.), -which runs inland some miles,
w'as, about 20 years ago, the home of thousands of
a species of black duck
that did not take to the
wing, but fluttered
along the surface of the
water. There was then
a fish-canning works at
Mandurah, and it was
decided to run the nets
out and snare some of
these ducks. The flr«t
attempt resulted in a
haul of 1100, which
were treated at the fac-
tory. Years afterwards,
while there on a fishing
excursion, we borrowed
some nets and secured
48 ducks in less than
half an hour. The nets
were laid parallel with
the shore, and as the
birds swam up towards
the floats they dived
and became entangled
in the meshes. The nets
were then pulled into a
circle, and any ducks
remaining were shot.
Many thousands were
snared in this way and
tinned at the factory.
“Sucre” : Everyone knows the record high
jump done by a horse ; but I’m out after pig per-
formances. At Yangan (S.Q.) I saw a black-and-
white boar sail over a fence sft. 3in. high. He didn't
scramble up, but leapt straight from the ground.
* ♦ * «
"Kunika Tau”: “Bouragi’s” par. (B.
17/5/’23) about the sawfish caught in Tamata
Creek (Papua) brought back to my mind that
in 1914, when with Rupert Clarke’s expedition,
I caught one of these fish with hook and
line in the Alice River about 50 miles above
where it junctions with the Fly. That would
be somewhere about 500 miles from the coast—
that is, following the stream, which would be the
most likely way for Mr. Sawfish to travel. This
was the only one of the species we caught on the
trip, but we got other kinds which were new to the
white members of the expedition and which our
native carriers could not identify. One kind, similar
in appearance to a black bream except that it had
protruding nostrils, was about the most unpalatable
thing in the fish line that ever I tasted. Near our main
depbt, nearly 600 miles up the Fly, we caught several
lung fish. At certain seasons a curious phenomenon
may be observed on the wide reaches of this river.
Swarms of small yellowish moths skim along the top
of the water like a fleet of miniature hydroplanes,
and following and feasting on them may be seen
large shoals of fish. These are similar to herrings in
appearance, but in no other way, as those we cooked
and sampled turned out to be about as juicy as a
plateful of cocoanut fibre.
PUTTING THEIR MITES TOGETHER.
SPIRITUALIST SPEAKER: “My dear friends, we are now about to
give a demonstration of collective effort.”
DAD (to Missus): “Gripes, here comes the plate! I thought there
was some 'ave in it.”
“E.P.” : We were doing construction work
on the telegraph line near Mackay (Q.) and left a
live wire hanging to within 4 ft. of the ground at
knock-off time. Jacko, the boss’s new rouseabout,
happened to touch this wire, and got a shock. Next
morning the boss, who turned out at daylight, was
mystified by the sight of Jacko sneaking up towards
the wire, taking advantage of every bit of cover on
the way. At last, having with infinite caution got
close up, he suddenly shot out his hand and touched
the juice-conductor. He was still gasping at the
shock when he spotted the boss. “Klise,” he ejacu-
lated, ‘'what name that one? No matter how quiet
you bin come he bin know it!”
* * ■* *
“Bolide Bill”: “Pedro” (B. 31/5/’23), ex-
tolling the virtues of the kurrajong, reminds me that
two very different vegetables bear that name. The
bushmen of the North Coast (N.S.W.) know as
kurrajong a weed which inhabits the brinks
of ridges and tops of plateaux too dry and weather-
worn to support anything else. It grows in single
stalks like the sunflower, sometimes to a height of
Bft., gives off an offensive odor, is inhabited by
tiger-snakes and bandicoots, and is about the easiest
type of brush to mow down. The many who know it
and are unfamiliar with the valuable inland tree of
the same name but totally different species must
take such testimonies as “Pedro’s” with a whole
bagful of salt.
* * » *
“Keystring”: Fluke shots, is it? About
the end of last century, Laurie, an elder brother of
Gilbert Finlay, one of the first Australians men-
tioned in despatches in the war, while getting a
few marsupial-skins near South Grafton (N.S.W.) —
the family had not then moved to Westralia, though
the dad, an architect, was there —used to fire his rifle,
if coming home late, to let the family know he was
all right. One dark night he tipped up the barrel
casually, and let go—and a dead ’possum fell from a
near-by tree, drilled by his .32 bullet.
■* * HI •
“Skyrider”: “The Deacon’s” prad (B.
24/5/’23) reminds me of another horse, Ned Kelly,
which belonged to a bank manager at Crookwell
(N.S.W.) about 20 years ago—a big chestnut, age
unknown, as quiet as a pet dog. If you walked into
the paddock with a bridle and Ned saw you strolling
towards him, it was good-night to all hope of catch-
ing him. The only way was to leap through the
fence or over the gate and rush straight at him as if
you were breaking the record. He would then stand
perfectly still and open his mouth for the bit. It
was said that he was formerly owned by a bush
gentleman who frequently had to leave the vicinity
of the police rather hurriedly, and there may have
been something in the yarn. I knew an old black
hack in S. Aus. which was built on entirely different
lines. In his case, as soon as he spotted the bridle
he came charging up at 20 miles an hour with his
mouth open. If you knew his little ways you stood
your ground; he always pulled up within a few feet
and waited. But a newchum at the game invariably
got to the other side of the fence, whereupon the
old prad would indignantly retire to the farthest
corner of the run and sulk.
* * * *
“H.S.K.”: Re “FYT’s” remark (B.
17/5/’23) that Queens-
land bush animals are
all infested with tick
except ’possums. In
the south-west of W.A.
kangaroos, brush kan-
garoos and wallabies
are infested more
or less with a big
blue tick, also a most
irritating kind of louse.
The ’possum is worried
by this latter pest. If
you put your hand on
the skin of any of these
animals after they are
dead, in a few seconds
you feel a swarm of
the hardly distinguish-
able lice racing up
your arm. On one
occasion my dogs
caught a big ’roo that
was practically too
weak to stand up—-a
mere skeleton, although
there was plenty of
feed about. A post-
mortem showed it had
large blue ticks around
its nose, eyes, ears,
tail, and wherever they
could get a foothold,
and it was literally
covered with lice. Once
I saw a brush kangaroo
run ahd fall over;
then, picking itself up,
it repeated the perform-
ance twice before the
dogs got it. After a
couple of bites they
stood back opening and
shutting their mouths
in a comical way, as
if trying to spit. I
examined the animal,
and it was a lousy mass
of bones. Brush skins
were dear at the time,
but I didn’t skin that
one.
“Sucre”: "F. Clinton” (B. 31/5/’23) men-
tions the futile attempt of Wyalong and Scone people
to popularise Angora goat-flesh as a substitute for
beef and mutton. No doubt the venture failed be-
cause goat-farmers marketed long-whiskered “stink-
ers” instead of juicy juveniles. I have dined off a
two-months-old kid, and found it equal to the best
lamb. Mount Morgan (C.Q.) is the home of the
common goat, and the longer they live the stronger
they smell. Notwithstanding, Queensland slaughtered
25,080 last year for food, and 625 Angoras.
* * * *
“Tom Pepper”: Re “ Jackaburra” and the
bloke who nearly cut his own head off (B. 10/5/’23).
Many years ago a timber-getter in Gippsland
(Vic.) was lopping the limb of a fallen tree several
feet from the ground when the limb snapped and
the axeman lost his balance and fell backwards.
By some unaccountable means the blade of the
axe severed his throat to the spinal column. This
happened before the poor chap’s body reached the
ground. He never lost the grip of his axe.
THE REWARD OF INDUSTRY.
PAT: “Watchew always workin’ overtime for
now?”
MIKE: “Well, ye see, I bin bound over to
keep the peace fer stoushin ’ that swine
O’Brien, and when I ’it ’im again it’ll
cost ten quid.”
(Continued on page 24.)
THE NEWCHUM SHEARER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The shed roll-up was poor that year
And they were pushed for men;
So though he said he could not shear
They booked him up a pen.
At “forty bob a hundred” he
Seemed satisfied enough,
And hacked away contentedly,
Though big they were and rough.
’Twas in the penning-up somehow
There strayed into his pen
A ram the size of any cow —
He grabbed him there and then.
His hefty load lie dragged across
The b&irrd and to the
To where the station tally-boss
Was weighing up the bales.
“It’s forty bob a hundred, eh?
Well, strike me [censored] fat,
Just give this blighter ’ere a weigh—
He must go more than that!”

THE BEER WITHOUT A RIVAL-f
"Orion”: “Condamine” (B. 31/5/’23)
quotes a horse harnessed to a cart crossing a stream
*2O yards wide. The first time I took a hand in get-
ting a nag across the Darling behind a boat (one
rowing and another holding the horse’s head up with
a halter) I made a mess of it. Not realising the
weight a horse can put on the halter in the circum-
stances, I let it slip through my fingers, and the prad
-a half-broken three-year-old colt —sank like a
stone. We gave him up for lost, and all the new-
chum names known to westerners were hurled at me
for my carelessness. Lord knows how much later we
were staggered to see the;'brute crawl out of the
water on the other side, but minus the halter. The
river was fully 100 yards wide at this point. We
were never game to try him again, so whether he
was a long-distance diver or not I can’t say. inci-
dentally, I have often had horses in shallower water
get across a stream by touching bottom and spring-
ing to the surface for air, as “Condamine’s” did.

down a spare brick , will ye? I’m short

“Raupo”: Tell ‘'Jesmond” (B. 19/4/*23)
who is worried by the attentions of blowflies to his
blankets that the only thing to do is to get a canvas
bag, stuff the blankets in it upon arising (preferably
before sunrise), and tie the mouth of the bag tightly.
New blankets in particular have such an attraction
for the buzzers, both of the blue and yellow variety,
that “Jesmond” may find his canvas covering thickly
coated with the results of their untiring energy ; but
it is a simple matter to scrape these off the smooth
canvas, whereas it is an almost impossible feat where
new hairy blankets are concerned. The flies are no
respectors of nationality—Pommy or M.L. blankets
are no more immune than those of Aussie manu-
facture.
"Jay Aye” : Are black swans following the
example set by ducks and other waterfowl, and seek-
ing elevated nesting positions to protect their young
from the fox? The reported discovery' of a large
nest at the Coorong (S.A.) by a blackfellow lends
color to the suggestion. He
says it was built on the
crown of a small gum-tree,
about 10ft. from ihe
ground. The small, leafy
branches were interwoven
just as you find the reeds
hr-a swan’s nest. The
structure was partly sus-
pended, and swayed with
the wind. As down and
feathers, in> addition to
pieces 'of eggshell, were
in the nest, the brood had
evidently been hatched.
Unfortunately, the abo.
destroyed the nest, which
prevented further investi-
gations. Pairs of ducks
are often seen during the
breeding season prospect-
ing the timbered country
in search of suitable
nesting-places. They give
one the idea that instinct
is compelling them to look
for something they don’t
understand. Stretches of
water no lontrer offer
protection, -for a fox was recently shot on an
island over 200yds. from the mainland.
* * * •
“Jimmy Possum” : “Baal Gammon's” yarn
about his mate bumping' along in a dray with three
felloes and a few spokes only (B. 10/5/’23) reminds
me of a jovial Bananaland cocky I met one day
driving home from the pub in a dray without any
rotators. “Ish orright, mate,” he hiccoughed, when
I asked about the absent wheels, “the blankersh
cornin’ behind—givin’ ’em a flamin’ race.” Some
humorless cuss had removed the linch-pins while
Cocky was filling up at the pub.
“Ezekiah”: “El Dorado” (B. 24/5/’23)
didn’t laiow my daughter, or he wouldn’t label Mrs.
Fraser “a ringer among her sex.” Mary Ezekiah
practically entered the world with the blades in one
hand and a sheep in the other. In her tlappevhood
she was a good ringer, but after she passed her 21st
birthday she could run the blades over 90 sheep day
after day without hounding the curl out of her hair
or the blissful expression out of the jumbucks’ orbs.

“Harry J.”: Old hands frequently men-
tion such and such a horse or cow that “died on
me” ; and I recollect one instance where the expres-
sion was literally correct. Old Bob, who had a
clearing job on the roadside, bought for a few
shillings a very ancient mare from a swagman who
had probably found her alongside the track. That
night he tethered her to a sapling ,at the side of his
tent, and, leaving her a soap-box full of chaff and
bran handy, turned in. It was 2 a.m. when the
crash came. Bob woke to the sound of the crack-
ling of the side poles of his tent; then the gothic
framework of the old prad bulged the calico and
bags, ripped them from their moorings, and, settling
down with a groan and a convulsive fore-and-aft
kick, pinned Robert to his bunk. For ever after-
wards the old chap used to tell us about “a good
sort of a mare that died on me,”
* * * *
“Arabe” : “Azae’s” 80-miles-an-hour giraffe
(B. 24/5/’23) helps me to believe in the tales
of a, friend recently returned from India concern-
ing the speed of the cheetah, or hunting leopard.
He says this four-legged bit of lightning can give
the black buck (the speediest of its kind in
India) a start of 400yds. and catch it before it
has gone another 400. This means a speed of about
70 miles an hour. Fortunately for the deer tribe,
the cheetah can bore the atmosphere at this speed
only so long as the breath with which it commenced
the pursuit lasts. When it has to take another
it is winded, and has to give up, consequently its
limit is something under 1000yds. The Bpeed
sounds incredible, but after “Azae’s” giraffe—well,
why not ?
“Wandi”: The other day I had crawled
nearly a mile to get a shot at a flock of magpie
geese that were feeding on a green flat near a big
swamp. At the moment I fired another bloke fired
from the opposite direction. We both ran up and
found one bird lying dead where the flock had been.
Argument naturally ensued. The other bloke was
positive he’d shot the bird, because he aimed at the
nearest and saw it drop. I was about to advance
similar proof, when I noticed something and gave the
corpse a kick. It had been dead at least two days.
“Jay Aye”: When Old Joe, the bird-
catcher, seriously said he’d sooner rob an eagle’s nest
than that of a butcher-bird, I smiled; but now I
understand. A 13-year-old lad, spending his holi-
days on a station north of Adelaide, found a
butcher-bird’s nest with young ones in it, and his
cousin, a girl of his own age, wanting the youngsters
for pets, he climbed the tree. Although the birds re-
sented his approach to the nest, it was not until he
had put the young ones in a bag he had slung over
his shoulder that they seemed to realise what he
wr s’ after. They then attacked him furiously. One
hung on to his ear until it tore away. Whenever
the boy struck out at one with his free hand the
other assaulted him from the opposite side. The girl
screamed and threw sticks at the birds, but could
render no effective assistance. The lad, while fight-
ing, tried to slide down the limb, but a notch caught
in the seat of his pants and for a time held him
prisoner. As the young birds were squeaking loudly
he-loosened the bag and dropped it. The parents
followed and attacked the bag while the lad
descended. His face was in a terrible state, and he
THE NEUROTIC AT THE BARBER’S.
managed to just reach the house before he collapsed.
A doctor was immediately telephoned for, but did
not arrive for 24 hours. By that time blood-
poisoning had set in and the youngster died three
days later. The doctor thought that the birds had
been feeding on carrion, and had carried the germs
on their bills.
* * * *
“Yarra Bank”: Last January a lad on
holiday out Tambo (Q.) way was cantering home
one afternoon when he became aware that he was
being followed or chased by a brolga, which was
alternately running and flying. He kept on and
arrived at the homestead with the bird still in
attendance. It had a good drink and a feed, then
camped among the horses. It took a particular
fancy to one old mare, which it now frequently fol-
lows out on the run. The bird is becoming very
cheeky, monopolises the feed of the fowls and of the
tame cockatoo, and gives any of the women folk a
hefty peck if they are not: watching. What
strange fancy or instinct induced the brolga to fol-
low the lad in the first instance? Even admitting
that the drought .was severe, the incident still seems
unaccountable. Anyhow, the fact of the bird remain-
ing for six months seems to suggest that it has
a lively appreciation of a good wicket. Probably
it will depart in the mating season.
“Jimmy Possum”: Re tremendous journeys
on horseback (B. 3/5/’23). Here are a few that
can be authenticated. Some years ago, the late
.T. A. McCartney, travelling manager for the Q.
Cattle Co., rode in one day and without changing
horses from Waverley
station (Q.) to Rock-
hampton—lo2 miles.
The trip from Prairie
station to Gladstone
(Q.), 90 miles, was
often made by him in
one day, and on at
least one occasion it
was covered between
daylight and dark with
a led packhorse. This
game old boy—he was
well past the age limit
when these riding
stunts were performed
—claimed to have rid-
den 130 miles in one
day without changing
mounts. When he had
a long ride ahead, he
breakfasted on a snack
of bread and butter
and a cup of tea ; for
refreshments along the
road he carried only
a flask of whisky. He
passed out at 80-odd
a while back, after be-
ing bedridden for about two years.
“Yarrum”: In the good old day's a dead-
beat wandered into the pub at Boro (N.S.W.) with
an old muzzle-loading gun that he wanted badly io
trade for 10s. “Is she any good?” asked a squiffy
squatter. The ’beat said she wasn’t too bad. “Then,”
said the sozzled gentleman, “I’ll give you £1 for a
shot at you at 100yds.; and, if she hits, ITT give
you two.” The squattah missed badly, and was so
incensed that he offered £ 5 for a go with a bullet.
I nearly forgot to mention that the only sober people
present were the gun-owner and Mrs. P. House; also,
that it was the gun that afterwards shot Lord
Ancrum.
* * * *
“Van Cat”: Another worm has turned.
A well-known identity of Robb’s Jetty and the
Fremantle Mole (W.A.), having grown tired of
having his word doubted, has imported a device
to attach to his fishing-rod. It is a Yankee idea
(where else would it be needed?), and is fixed to
the rod and line. It has a compensatin'? balance
to eliminate the pull caused by the fish, the actual
weight of Mr. Fin being registered on a card.
At the conclusion of a day’s sport the total catch
is neatly classified for reference. The Worm now
tells his story backed up by documentary evidence.
* * *
"Ezekiciii": Here’s the straight oil for
keeping ants out of safes. About a foot from
the receptacle put an inch-thick line of crystal sugar,
continuing it without a break round the four sides.
The ants never get beyond it. They don't want to.
Try the thing before you scoff.
* * * *
Three of a kind:
"Mag” : With apologies 1 resuscitate the old theme
of the kangaroo birtli. With mine own eyes 1 have
now beheld the phenomenon, bar the actual birth.
A section of a large female 'roo was brought to my
house the other day, and we performed an illegal
operation. Through a filmy covering the embryo
could be plainly discerned. The film having been
carefully cut, this was extracted with the umbilical
cord attached. (The cord when gently extended was
nearly a foot long.) The eyes were distinct, the
mouth was a tiny round hole, the forearms were
developed and in motion, the tail was defined, but
the hind legs were only in process of development.
The embryo over all was perhaps a little over one
inch, had a curious resemblance to a pup, and was
evidently on the point of birth. Alongside the preg-
nant sac was another, plainly indicating Nature’s
allowance for -twins. Does not the remarkably small
size of the new-born joey hinge on the kangaroo s
peculiar mode of propulsion? Presuming Nature, in
the ordinary course of events, ordained the period
of gestation to be nine months, and assuming Joes
attained to one-fifth the size of a calf, would this
not be an impediment to Mammy when in flight,
and tend to rupture her internal organs and cause
malformation or death to little Joseph? As things
are we have a premature birth, and a soft, snug
cabin for Joe’s conveyance which expands or con-
tracts at Mammy’s sweet will. The operator at.
our seance—one of the very few who liave witnessed
a birth —described it thus, bearing out the descrip-
tion supplied by an Abo. contributor some months
ago: “The back is arched, the tail brought well forward
underneath, and the head bent low down. The young
is then delivered on to the butt of the tail, and the
split hare-lips of the mother (so well formed for the
purpose) gently place it on the teat.” By the wav,
the result of our operation is now bottled in spirits.
“A.J.J.T.”: Here is a scientific reference to
kangaroo birth taken from the British Medical
Jouhnal : “The manner in which the foetus gets into the
pouch in marsupials, as kangaroos and opossums,
puzzled naturalists for more than a century. A
simple explanation was given by Qoerling, of Perth
(W.A.), in 1906. When the embryo marsupial reaches
a certain development it is born from the female
by the usual channel. But it is born blind. But
though blind the arms are well developed, and fingers
are furnished with well-developed claws, and
it can open and close its hands like the paws of
a cat. This foetus makes its way by aid of its
claws through the fur of its mother till it finds the
opening into the pouch. It enters, finds a teat and
fastens itself on to it with powerful jaws. The
fentus travels through the mother’s fur, moving its
arms in a swimming fashion, and leaves a track in
its mother’s fur which lasts for some hours. In
the mother’s pouch the young kangaroo is protected,
warmed and fed and develops its fur.”
“The Toiler”: I held to the bushman’s view that
the young kangaroo grows on the teat until I
attended a drive at Cbolatai station, Warialda
(N.S.W.), in 1885, at which Caldwell, a member of
the British Naturalists’ Association and his assistant,
Watt, examined every female of the 1500 that were
yarded. I think the result convinced all who were
TRULY A BLACK WORLD.
“It's a terrible thing old Mrs. Casey dyin’; they’re not openin’ the
pub until after the funeral.”
present that the young- were born in the ordinary way
and placed by the parent on the teat. Caldwell
informed me that, from the numerous examinations
he had made, he concluded that where the mother
kangaroo had hard times, and was compelled to travel
long distances for feed or water, the young were often
prematurely born, but lived on account of the
natural shelter provided by the pouch. He came
to this conclusion on account of finding in some cases
young ones apparently more matured in the womb than
in the pouch. A great number of specimens were
collected at this drive by Caldwell and preserved
in spirits, but I believe most of them were lost
in crossing the Maeintyre River in a buggy. The
yard into which we drove the ’roos had hessian
wings over a mile long, and the hoppers were driten
over some bushes into an excavation about sft.
deep, from which they went up an easy grade into
the yard. The excavation and bushes prevented the
leading ’roos from coming out again. There were
65 of us doing the driving, and our captain was
Cotton, the well-known Queensland squatter. The
drive lasted three days, and during the time we
were hospitably entertained by Codrington, the then
owner of Coolatai.
WHITEWASH FOR WOY WOY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The citizens of Wov Woy, in public meeting
assembled, have entered an emphatic protest against
the allegations recently published that every week-
end witnesses a saturnalia of drunkenness and disso-
luteness in the district.”
O satyrs, half-goatlike, half simian,
Who streaked after Bacchus the young
(As featured in Keats’s “Endymion”)
And got so uproariously stung,
■ • One might think reincarnate your band is
Athirst for new razzle and joy,
And seeking, mutatis mutandis,
The same at Woy Woy r .
O cruelty (with 90 per centum
Of canard) that Woy Woy would drag
To the level of lurid Tarentunv
Where Homans repaired for a jag!
Where anglers their dreamy diversions
Secure front the sibilant seas,
Who ever encountered aspersions
So fishy as these?
Would they class you with London's A Isa t la-
in Whitefriars 1 think it was set —
Now a memory, no more, Dei gratia,
But oncej oh! so wanton and wet?
Would they daub you with soot of the Bowery ?
Do they limn you with hops in your hair
Fandango-ing, Hawkesbury the flowery,
And Woy Woy the fair?
At Vauxhall, one knows, there were orgies
Whereon few would faithfully touch
In the days of the dissolute Georges—
Corinthians and Mohawks and such.
The Rocks may have seen saturnalia,
Or square jamborees, we’ll allow ;
But then she was younger, Australia,
And wilder than now.
O shicker, its shame and its stigma!
O vice that is vinous and Vexed!
It’s still an elusive enigma,
Wnose turn for a slap will come next.
Do I dream that our morals are mending?
Shall 1 wake to “Millennium Ahoy!”
When only the wowsers are wending
Their way to Woy Woy?

HUDSON SUPER-SIX.
HUDSON strength begins with engine
and chassis design, it is developed
in the construction, and is the pre-
dominant feature throughout the whole car.
Nothing is left to chance; every piece
of material that goes into the construc-
tion of the car is tested and retested until
the whole car represents the best obtain-
able in manufacture and material.
It is from this that the Super-Six gets
its ability to outlast and outperform cars
of much higher price, and it is this that
has made it —

Powders
His Ex. and Dame Margaret Davidson,
who have been perhaps the hardest worked
vice-regal pair that N. S. Wales has known
for half-a-century, will say a long, last fare-
well to this State in March: with their
family they will leave for England by the
Euripides on the Bth. The spaniel Peggy,
the Scotch terrier Bruce and the parrots
from the Seychelles will also be of the
party. It is expected that Premier George
Fuller will be in a position to announce
Sir Walter’s successor very soon after bis
return to N. S. Wales.
On July 8 his Ex. and Dame Margaret
Davidson will leave for Broken Hill, going
via Condobolin. On the way they will boil
the billy at Trida, Ivanhoe and Wilcannia,
incidentally giving their blessing to any-
thing that is in need of it. They expect
to arrive at the Hill on the 14th, and will
leave five days later for Wentworth. Thence
they go to Mildura, returning to Sydney via
Melbourne on July 26.
Last Friday afternoon the forceful face
and figure of Melba dominated the Show of
Australian Art at the Education Gallery.
Longstaff has just completed this portrait of
the song-bird, who, truth to tell, makes one
think of a multiple-course dinner rather than
of a supper of nightingales’ tongues. But
lxmgstaff’s brush has caught a truly remark-
able likeness—one feels the indomitable force
of the woman looking out of the small, alive
eyes. It is Melba, sure of her art, of herself,
and of her Voice. For the rest she is wear-
ing a frock of moonlight-blue—-the frock, by
the way, that was first worn at the People’s
Concert. It merges into a background of
warm, soft night, stabbed by electric lights.
A tiara and a diamond and pearl necklace
are other accessories. A clutter of artists
and the friends of Art waited about from
3 till after 4 to pour floods of congratu-
tions over our John; but the artist didn’t
turn up till the gallery was almost empty.
And then he crept in looking as though lie
rather expected to meet reproachful scorn
or, worse, a request for a speech.
The Governor-General’s car, bearing the
G.-G.’s lady, found its way into Dowling-
street in the ’Loo one cold afternoon last
week. The Council of the Kindergarten
Union had called a rally of its committees
and voluntary helpers, and the vice-regal
lady came along to show her interest in the
better baby. The play area of the school
was used as a tea-house, and the grown-ups
seated themselves as sedately as bishops upon
the baby chairs around the baby tables. But
mere males like President Cohen and Innes-
Noad stood up to the tea-drinking. Aide
Lawrence’s blue eyes most of the time
dreamily contemplated his own beautiful new
hat. Miss Desailly, Miss Dumolo, Mrs.
Anderson and Florence Sulman took an
active interest in the afternoon; and Dr.
Charlie MacLauriri’s wife turned on the light
of a blue frock with fur outposts.
Sydney’s women doctors listened in the
Assembly Room of the Women’s Club the
other day to the report of the first year’s
work of their very own hospital at Surry
Hills. In 12 months the patients, all women
and children, numbered oxer 6000; nearly
1000 of these were kiddies under 14. Dr.
Lucy Gullett’s voice sounded triumphant as
she read the report, and the pink carnations
on the lapel of her grey coat seemed to
blush more rosily ; and when Treasurer Mar-
garet Harper announced a credit balance of
£173, the lay listener couldn’t help wonder-
ing what sort of Federal Budget might come
from a female Prime Minister. Cheery Con-
stance D’Arcy outlined the reason of the
hospital’s coming into being—and that briefly
was the need felt by hard-up Miss and
Mrs. Sydney for the advice and service of
her medical sister. It is worth a note that
the eases attending the venereal clinic have
more than doubled. And that is another
good step towards the health of the com-
munity. Professor Mills and Dr. Purser
handed sweet-swelling herbs of praise to the
sisterhood; and the G.-G.’s lady, who pre-
sided over the gathering, endorsed the com-
pliments.
On Saturday, to the obbligato of flapping
flags in a biting westerly, Sir Walter and
Dame Margaret declared the memorial stones
of a new r wing at Western Suburbs Cottage
Hospital. Croydon, well and truly laid. The
affixed tablets testified to the munificence of
tobacco magnate G. F. Todman, who gave
£20,000 to meet the needs of the institution
and, incidentally, as a memorial to his daugh-
ter. After the formal talk their Exes, wan-
dered through the building and had a cheery
word or two with the patients.
The Firm ran to a tea-leaf brew at the
Cavalier the other afternoon to allow its
new concert artist, Lydia Lipkovska, to say
“Hello!” to several tablesful of Sydney. The
lady has a complexion of radiant fairness,
and her husband says that even the suns of
Java and India could not scorch it. It is
claimed for her that she is a frocker of un-
usual charm and originality, and carries with
her a wardrobe of almost royal splendors.
One frock is so stiff with gold embroideries
that it is a heavyweight even for a strong
man. One tea-drinker turned to Madame’s
husband. “I have just heard the story about
your wife always practising in a room
where she is surrounded by her pet birds.
Such a charming idea ! So romantic!”
M’sieur lifted a whimsical eyebrow'. “For
Madame and the birds, yes! But for
others” and he ended the sentence on
an expressive little hand-movement.
As usual St. John’s was the belle of the
season’s College dances. The long avenue
had more than its usual starry crop of lan-
terns and electrics, and within doors the
scene was gorgeous enough for an Asche
production. The hall, with its beautiful
woodwork, was a succession of pools of
golden light cast by the deep-toned shades
through w'hich the electrics glowed. Masses
of autumn leaves in all the rooms served as
a perch for what resembled the Rowan col-
lection of butterflies. The variegated winged
things wheeled and shone everywhere till
they affected the dancing-girl’s head nearly
as much as they did the poor little French
flapper whom Madeleine Rossitter used to
recite about; and as for the stuffed croco-
dile, he wore one in his ear with great effect.
At the head of the stairs Principal of the
College Dr. O’Reilly turned the cream of his
tongue to bid his guests welcome: and so
passed them on to the warmth of a firelit, deep-
chaired lounge. The principals of the other
colleges within the Uni. gates turned up in
strong force; and young R.C. Law and
Medicine with their best girls were respon-
sible for a good deal of the wear and tear
of the ballroom floor.
On with the dance was also the slogan of
bt. Vincent’s ex-students mkhvay through
i They chose the Wentworth for
the display of their new season’s frocking.
Over 200 Old Girls of the Darlinghurst
school turned up to the reunion, which w T as
strong in good looks and smart frocking.
Still another of the week’s College dances
was that of St. Ignatius’s Old Boys. They
stuck to their old love, the Paddington Town
Hall, and decorated it with banks of palms
and the royal blue and white of the College
colors.
Old Grammarians of the Shore stirred the
Wentworth’s froth of gaiety higher than
usual the other night when they sandwiched
their annual cheerio between the ballroom
and the Palm Court. Red and yellow roses
and Iceland poppies glowed on every table,
and the school flag looked decorously down
on the goings on. New (and young) head-
master Robson brought his attractive Eng-
lish wife in flame-colored frocking; Mrs.
I’urves had with her daughter Joan; and
good-looking Mrs. Esplin, who is the strong-
est pillar every year of the ball’s architec-
ture, shed her air of usefulness, and in glit-
tering black was one of the smartest frockers
in the room. Miss Rhodes, another consis-
tent committee woman, was in soft pale
blue. The Shore’s younger set and its flapper
friends turned up by the hundred; and sec-
retary Heron and treasurer Crane will have
something like a cheque to hand over to the
memorial playing-fields fund.

Gladys Pott, who has an 0.8. E. and labors
under the cumbersome title of Chairwoman
2* Society for the Overseas Settlement of
British. V omen, is a practical, observant
lady with the un-English facultv of smooth-
ing her Australian listeners’ fur instead of
rubbing it up the wrong way. She has had
during the week a kind of triumphal proces-
sion from one women’s organisation to an-
other, and everywhere the O.K. stamp has
been put upon her. Midway through last
week the A r ictoria League (of which august
body the lady is a vice-president in London)
spread a lunch for her in the white-and-gold
room of the Mary Elizabeth. Dame Mar-
garet shed vice-regal distinction over the c m-
plimentary cutlet; and the visiting guest was
further cheered by a bouquet o» yellow roses.
Society that turns a serious frown on the
problems of its country applauded the speeches
with its knife-handle at the proper intervals.
From the Victoria League lunch the energetic
Miss Pott dashed to the Royal Colonial In-
stitute, where the representatives of a per-
fectly terrifying list of leagues and such like
awaited her. Here the G.-G.’s lady did the
honors, supported by a strong rally of Vic-
toria Leaguers that included Chief Justice
Cullen’s wife, the Storey and Denison ladies,
Dame Alice Chisholm and Mrs. Holman. One
thing the speaker stressed—the immigrant
abigail is not, and must not be expected to
be, the polished and bevel-edged maid of 25
years ago. She is mostly drawn from the fac-
tory and the secondary school. Mrs. Orams
(Salvation Army), Ruth Beale and Mrs.
MacCallum threw a few observations into
the arena ; and Lady Forster ended proceed-
ings by putting on record her admiration for
the housewifely qualities of the Australian
woman.
George Mcßae’s finest monument is the
Registrar-General’s office, which he designed
to harmonise
with St.
Mary’s Cath-
edral alo n g-
side; and the
effect is some-
thing that
town-planners
love to linger
over. In the
days before he
became Gov-
ernment Archi-
tect he served
the City Coun-
cil ; and if the
big thing he
did there —the
Queen Vic-
toria Markets
—did not turn
out a finan-
cial success, it
wasn’t his
fault: he was
told what was wanted, and nobody can say
that he didn’t produce a majestic pile. He
reached the retiring age only a few months
ago, and had no peaceful twilight—ill-health
was with him all the time. A widow and
two daughters are grieving over their loss.
Marie and Madge Ellis, who are at home
either at Waterloo .station, Walcha, or at
Strathfield, went off on their travels last
year, and saw something of four continents;
and when Madge returned it was to find that
the time had seemed so long to Alfred
Waugh, of Barraba, that lie simply couldn’t
exist another six months without a wedding.
The little live-wire of a girl just managed
to crowd it through in time : it happened at
St. Luke’s, Concord, a week or so ago, the
bride dressing for her part in ivory velvet
with an embroidered georgette train hung
from a shoulder and caught at the waist, and
a tulle veil held by a band of silver tissue
across the forehead, a spray of orange-
blossom on either side. The bride’s
understudies were Enid James and Emmie
Russell —like the bride, old P.L.C. girls;
and not so old either. They wore georgette
the color of rock melon, with black panne
velvet hats, lace-crowned. The ’groom pro-
duced a nephew, Harold Fletcher, of Ken-
tucky station, to support him, with Ken
Stinney as groomsman. After the hospitable
Ellises had duly entertained their 90 guests,
the small bride put on navy blue, took hold
of the steering-wheel of a new car father
had given her. and went off down the South
Coast. Her husband accompanied her; the
thing seemed to have been pre-arranged.
Dr. George Redford Hamilton has per-
suaded pretty Dagmar Quist to become Mrs.
Hamilton at an early date. Dagmar is one
of three sisters with names as unusual as
their brand of good looks: Lasca and Sieg-
frid are the others. Siegfrid was one of the
Tivoli beauty girls.
Maisie Scott, of Neutral Bay, will be an-
other of the month’s brides. Up till the
other day she was on the staff of the Union
Bank. But that didn’t keep her from making
every bit of her own trousseau. The young
man in her case is Arthur Sydney Rabbidge.
Waverley, where the family lived for so
long, will be interested in the engagement of
Grace Evelyn, youngest daughter of the late
“Bob” (R. G.) Watkins, to Keith, third
son of Mr. and Mrs. G. S. Mackellar of
Ardachy, Chats wood.
The Laidley-Levy wedding is timed for
one of the last days of this month. Bride-
groom-to-be’s father has presented the good-
looking Helen with her new home off Edge-
eliff-road. It’s Roslyndale, the old John
Hughes place, and it’s being “made over” by
decorators and architects.
This Letter the other day gave the late
Canon Kemmis a grand-daughter he no doubt
would have been proud of, but whom the
family-tree wouldn’t let him claim. Mrs.
E. W. Fenner is really his niece: her father
was a Mackay (Q.) run-holder.
t A year or so ago a child-lover in the
United Insurance ('o. started a little fund
to provide entertainment for sick kiddies
in Sydney’s many hospitals. The members
of the staff greeted the idea with enthusiasm,
and the result has been a whirl of Punch
and Judy shows, movies and tea-parties at
every hospital where there is a kiddies’
ward. Punch and Judy have put up their
classic performance as far out as Waterfall;
and the letters of thanks are towering up
like Kosciusko. There’s a movement now
on foot to get all the insurance offices to
combine in an Amusement Fund, and so swell
its proportions that outings and seaside and
country holidays may be added to the list
of smile-promoters among the baby sick.
Further information can be got from the
enthusiastic treasurer, Mabel Dansey, and
the secretary, H. Irving Burrows, of the
United Insurance Co.
Miss Prior, who has come to Australia
from the Girl Guides’ lI.Q. in London to
do instructional and organising work, will
be in Sydney on June 27. She will be the
guest of his Ex. and Dame Margaret at Gov-
ernment House.
Lute Drummond and just-arrived Lily
Juncker linked up at the Commissioner
Cooks’ monster at-home the other week in
Lily is studying with Amy Sher-
win. At Philip Wilson’s recital the Sydney
girl saw Mrs. Hardy Wilson among the
front-seaters. Philip did an almost entirely
Elizabethan programme, specially dedicated
to one Rossi ter, a musician who died in 1623,
leaving behind him 21 songs or “ayres.” The
composer is buried at St. Dunstan’s in the
West, which lies almost in the shadow of
Australia House.
Undeterred by the chilly blasts of the
night, three of the bare sex, sitting in the
front row of the d.c. at “Chu Chin Chow,”
decided to swallow an ice apiece. The atten-
dant, after leaving the three paper plates on
the balustrade, went his way. The talker in
tl>e middle, turning sharply from right to
left, swept her ice over the edge. In con-
sternation the three gazed into the stalls,
where a startled sister was hurriedly trying
to separate her spinal column from what she
had mistaken for the South Pole. Sud-
denly the house sensed the joke, and to the
accompaniment of bursts of laughter the
three ice-cream fiends rushed to the gloom
at the back of the circle.
Edmund Resell, the brewer, had about
£325,000 in his sock when he died; and the
two boys get it. The immigration people
lately made a film showing thet-jprogress of
a man who arrived less than 10 years ago
with about eighteenpence, went on the land,
and now is taking a trip to the old place
with £12,000 to the good. They might make
something more glittering out of Edmund
Rescli’s Australian career. It isn’t 50 years
ago that he was running his lemonade around
Wilcannia in a barrow.
Many people are familiar with Professor
J. W. Mackail’s “Latin Literature” and his
“Life of William Morris,” but it was a sur-
prise to read in Mrs. Patrick Campbell’s
book, “My Life and Some Letters,” that the
translation of Maeterlinck’s beautiful “Pel-
leas and Melisande,” in which she made such
a hit. was by the same professor. Mrs. Pat
tells how she came by it: —
One day .Jack Mackail brought me as an offering-
his translation of this lovely work, written out in
his own fine hand. This archaic poem of beauty,
passion and loveliness, unthumb-marked, and undog-
eared by tradition, gave me peace and certainty. I
had come into my own.
Forbes Robertson thought the play “weak
and morbid,” but Mrs. Pat insisted, and the
piece was put on with Mrs. Pat as Meli-
sande, Martin Harvey as Pelleas and Forbes
Robertson as loland. It took London by
storm. The first of the Professor’s Sydney lec-
tures on poetry, under the Uni. Extension
Board, will be spread at the King’s Hall on
July 9.
Artist John Eldershaw is over from Tas-
mania with cheeks that glow ruddier than
his native apple. He’s to hang a show of his
oil-colors in Gayfield Shaw’s rooms to-dav.
His home is an old mill in Richmond (Tas.),
a survival of convict architecture. Its chief
attraction, he says, is that it is 14 miles
from a railway.
Ex-State Commandant Lee is these days
in charge, of a co. that is growing oysters
up north. His shell-fish are so well drilled
that he simply has to play the “Reveille”
when he wants them to get out of their bed.
Occasionally they grow too hilarious; then
he comes down to Manly for a rest cure.
O. N. Gillespie, who has written fine
verse and prose for The Bulletin, has
climbed to the top, if not of Parnassus, at
least of a peak that in Maoriland eyes is a
dizzier eminence. Pie has just been ap-
pointed general manager in those parts of the
P irst National Film Exhibitors’ Association,
under whose banner Norma and Connie Tal-
madge, Jackie Coogan, Richard Barthelmess
and such like immortals are enrolled.

Phones Cantrel 1532, 1533,
For the opening of the Federal talking-
shop by Forster, G.-G., a bigger crowd than
ever struggled into the listening galleries.
Priminister Bruce looked paler and less self-
confident than usual while his Ex. got off
his “speech.” Willy Watt cut a weird figure
with white horsehair all over the top end of
him. It is loudly hinted that Mrs. Willie
snorts scornfully at his official adornment,
and she is supposed to have rendered up
thanks for having left her kiddies at home
and thus spared them the saddening sight.
After the ceremonial everyone made a bee-
line for the teacups, which were laid out on
tables all over the place, under picturesque
overgrowths of pink carnations and ferns.
Mrs. Bruce fed her special crowd in the
Members’ room. Under a fur wrap her mole-
colored georgette, scalloped at the hem,
showed mauve and silver embellishments on
the upper deck, and her dark head was
tucked in a toque of mixed mole, mauve and
silver. Dr. Earle Page’s wife was in a
natty brown coat and skirt and had a thatch
of nasturtium velvet. The Brudenell White
dame smothered her dark-toned tailorings in
expensive furs. Bruce’s confidential-
secretary-to-be was not sighted, but his wife
loomed pleasantly in a vivid red headpiece
topping furs and navy tailorings. Her
mother-in-law, who is Senator Guthrie’s sis-
ter, was in all black. Little Mrs. Victor Sel-
heirn was bustling round without her
General, and Mrs. Ferrers Guy, wife of the
Priministerial private sec., and Commander
Hyde’s good-looking feminine half also drank
bohea in the Bruce sector.
The Civil Ambulance Ball, held at St.
Kilda, justified its picturesque title of “The
Thousand Lanterns.” The lanterns—oodles
of them —were looped in several tiers over
the balconies against a backing of inky
velvet and palm branches, and further
starred the ceiling like the Milky Way on
a jag. A lighted picture screening the stage-
showed a symbolic figure with one leg in
mid-air and an unintentionally bacchanalian
aspect that made it look as if it was a left-
over from the Artists’ Ball. The much-
heralded procession of lantern-bearers, which
w r as to have been brightened by the leading
theatrical sljars, was frost-bitten through
many mummers defaulting at the eleventh
hour. Lady Forbes Robertson led the pain-
fully abbreviated crocodile under convoy of
banker Morrice Williams, and was followed
by daughter Anne McLean in primrose tint-
ings and a handful of lesser lights, while
Town-Clerk Fred Chamberlain brought up
the tail-end with half-a-dozen blue-capped
V.A.D.’s and a quartette of Ambulance men.
The leading lady spread a note of ravishment
in rose velvet foamed with smoky tulle.
The thrill of the evening occurred in the
cotillion fox-trot, when a bunch of girleens,
headed by Mardi Syme and Anne McLean,
handed favors to the male jazzers lined up
on one side and the petticoated section on
the other. But—la, la ! —many of the dan-
cers unblushingly heaved their trifles away
when they saw who had been given the twin
favors to their own. Bridge cards fluttered
above-stairs, where Admiral Clarkson’s dame
and Laura Nyulasy had dressed the premises
in autumn foliage and lanterns. The special
supper for theatricals and committeeites was
eaten in another upstairs chamber. One
damsel, who hungered for cold turkey, shot
the barrier, and Lawrence Grossmith oblig-
ingly left half his chicken-wing to make
room for the intruder. The young things
playfully showered each other with confetti
in the giddier moments after midnight.
Miss Gertrude Rennie, who was chiefly
responsible for the frivol and its success, w T as
nicely upholstered in golden tissue with whis-
perings of primrose taffetas. Mrs. Hyde
marred the attractiveness of her black crepe
coverings with a wisp of fur clasping her
delicate throat. The Tallis lady cloaked
dull gold with peach-colored velvet, and her
chum, Mrs. W. Robins, was expensively
sheathed in grey and silver brocade. The
Clarkson lady wore dusky hangings, and
Miss Nyulasy helped her in pale-blue satin
and silver, which spoke of a recent trip to
the French capital. Little June Roberts
was short-skirted in black flecked with beads.
Mrs. Grossmith was cloud-like in grey and
silver, and the Mackey lady spread mauve
and silver. The hon. treasurer. General
White, failed to materialise, but gunner
General Coxen was there with his wife and
a brace of girls; and Captain Pitt Rivers,
Naval-Captain Hyde, Commander Bnsh and
Major Meredith helped to make up the
crowd.
It was not the artists who gave the early
morning end of their annual ball a ruddy
tint, but a crowd of wild men and women
who blew in from another rowdy-dowdy and
hit things up with an impromptu bacchana-
lian scene. A superiah Cold Countryman,
who confesses an acquaintance with the
naughtiest night clubs in Paris and London,
remarked, "By Jove, it’s about the hottest
thing one has ever seen —what?” But apart
from the invading roysterers there was a
hectic spot or two. The supper-room can-
teen was a dry one, but the early-morning
bottle-oh can testify that the motor-cars
lined up outside were filled with contraband,
and the men’s dressing-room is also said to
have yielded a fair quota of empties.
A lady who was staging a whirl in the
St. Ivilda Town Hall the next evening trotted
in after her breakfast coffee to see that the
previous night’s debris was swept out in
time for her to get busy on her decorations.
Her horrified eyes lit on a crumpled mass of
swallow-tails on a settee. “ ’Scuse me!”
hiccuped the derelict, ‘‘came back to look for
m’ teeth —lost ’em at lasht night’s ball. So
tired, had to lie down and must have dropped
off.”
Captain F. C. Alsop handed daughter
Marion over to Ronnie, son of mint-manager
Albert le Souef, at the Melbourne Grammar
Chapel the other day. The bride blushed in
brocaded hangings beneath a Limerick lace
veil creamed with age. The Rupert Greenes’
two daughters, as her attendant maids, were
twin orchids in mquve velvet with cloudy
tulle floating from narrow headbands. Ivan
Le Soeuf helped Dr. Charlie Osborn to look
after the bridegroom, and the subsequent
healths were drunk at the Oriental.
Gaud Mayor Swanson, now that he has
got his “honor,” doesn’t hanker after any
extension of office, but will take a trip to
Europe next year, beginning in March —
about the time the St. Pat.’s Day parade
will be on.
The J. J. Brenan widow is mourning the
loss of her daughter Aggie, the home girl
of her family, who went out after a long
battle with the effects of a motor accident.
Until last week it was hoped that the in-
valid would recover; then she suddenly took
a bad turn, and her sisters Jennie and Eileen
blue-pend-lled all their professional engage-
ments to be with her.
At Benno Moiseiwitsch’s opening perform-
ance in the Town Hall, several rows of
chairs booked by civic officials loomed emptily
out of compliment to ex-Mayor Ilennessy.
The audience was mostly made up of the
really musical, who, after roaring apprecia-
tion at the proper intervals, finally drifted
out humming the lyrical bits which the pian-
ist stresses so beautifully, even in his most
classic items. The small Parkes boys
(brothers to Cecil) were there to learn and
enjoy, and Dr. Hamilton Russell sat in his
usual piano-recital seat. Charlie Tait
brought his two older daughters and a son,
and Frank Tait his pretty little wife, who
had wrapped herself in a very beautiful
silken shawl. The Robert Harpers’ daugh-
ter, Mrs. Alf Taylor, was there with a squad
of friends, the musical Godfrey sisters had
another party and violinist Muriel Camp-
bell came along with a pal. Mrs. Ben
Boothby, who is keen on musical events,
was also sighted in the front seats.
Nettie Walker, whose dad is head of Mel-
bourne Grammar’s chief prep, seminary,
Grimwade House, has just engaged herself to
Roddy Travis, son of the R. W. Travises
of Bewley, up Maffra way. Nettie has a
whole lot of younger brothers at home who
are thrilled.
Say how do you do to Edith Harrhy—
English by
birth, Austra-
lian by mar-
riage, and a
composer with
80 songs to her
credit. Of
these the best
known are
“Two Songs
of the Sea,”
and a collec-
tion of kiddies’
verses. Of the
latter “I
Won’t Come
Out of the
Bath” is the
favorite of
Edith’s daugh-
ter, Patricia,
aged three, an
Austral ian
edition of her
ex-soldier dad.
The composer is at present in Sydney, where
she is to give a recital next Saturday at the
Conservatorium.
Mrs. Hadwen lent the Franeatelli rooms
for an afternoon-tea and sing-song to swell
the funds of the Loreto Free Kindergarten, a
pleasing circumstance for which Mrs. James
Alston, kindergarten president, and Mrs.
de Gruchy, acting hon. sec., were primarily
responsible. Among their active assistants
were Mrs. Ben Hoare, Mrs. W. M. Robins,
Mrs. Merson Cooper and Mrs. Pat McCauley.
The last, by the way, is preparing to hand
her good works to various understudies for
a few months while she takes her younger
daughter north by way of a health tonic.
Gertrude Healey looked after the musical
portion of the afternoon. She herself did
some fiddling, Biddy Allan was at the piano
and George Cowley, Kathleen Fitzpatrick,
Madge Wren and several others sang attrac-
tively. And the cakes were plentiful and
creamsome.
The Women Automobilists spread the fes-
tive tea-cake in their club parlors last week
when Mrs. H. J. Robertson, in becoming
henna, launched a nicely-filled programme of
musical events, with Natalie Dawson at the
piano stool. A small boy, Dougall by name,
warbled with the purity of tone and selfless
passion one expects to hear in the heavenly
choir, another youngster fiddled wonderfully
well and Charity Wynne, a newcomer who
earns her crust as a dancer, elocuted prettily.

about Isabel’s fiddling, and told her to keep
on, as her tone was “superb” and nobody
was likely to be disappointed in her.
“Directly she comes on,” said Guy, “she
inspires her audience with confidence. They
sit up and say, ‘Now we are going to hear
something—no nonsense here.’ And they’re
quite right.”
The Melbourne Music Club welcomed
Benno Moiseiwitsch the other night in the
best parlor at the Lyceum Club, where pink
chrysanthemums of special quality nestled
amid autumn leaves. Fritz Hart unloaded
vvofds of greeting, which Benno acknowledged
with a smile, and Mrs. Fritz, trailing a lace
scarf over her blue silk, effected the num-
berless introductions. The star came under
the wing of Charlie Tait, who also brought
daughter Gwen, 'a fascinating item in an em-
broidered shawl which stirred envy in every
female breast. Marie Bremner, who has real
Springtime in her young throat, sang a de-
lightful trio of Elizabethan lyrics, and among
the chair-warmers were Prof. Laver, Ger-
trude Healey, Dallas Fraser, Rita Hope, Vio-
let Somerset, the Reggie Franklin widow (a
Sydney girl with a fine soprano which may
be soon loosed on the concert platform), Dr.
Rudall, the Albert Zelman pair, Miss
Michaelis and Ethel Godfrey.
One of the first Gazette notifications pub-
lished with Treasurer McPherson’s name to
it after he got his 1v.8.E. described him as
a rag-seller. He invited tenders from holders
of noxious-trades licenses for the purchase
of rags from the lunatic asylums.
Some people are never satisfied. In the
“Kelly country” (Strathbogie) the cookies
prayed hard for rain, not having had any
for four months, and now they are bemoan-
ing that the prayers got too unqualified an
answer. Mackrell, the Farmers’ Union mem-
ber for Upper Goulburn, reckons that 500.000
tons of water emptied itself on to his place,
in the last month, when 13 inches fell. He
had time to make calculations on the days
he was compelled to stay at home and watch
the downpour. The word “irrigation” is
taboo in the district —it’s almost as safe to
call a man an Orangeman.
Oxford’s poetry Professor Mackail, who is
likewise president of the British Classical
Association, has come here to give a series
of lectures with the blessing of the local
’varsities, and is accompanied by his wife —a
daughter of Burne Jones and a cousin of
Rudyard Kipling, of Britain’s new Prime
Minister and of Sir Edward Poynter. The
visiting pair had unpacked in the Malvern
home of their daughter, Mrs. Thirkell, when
the latter thoughtlessly developed the ’flu.
So the visitors were passed on to the Bertie
Austins.
Prof. Mackail, by the way, made his first
appearance in history in a letter written by
the great Burne Jones to the still greater
Watts, announcing the engagement of the
idolised Jones daughter to the man of litera-
ture :
Before he wanted her, and before I dreamed of any
such thing, I thought him a fine gentleman through
and through, and yet—look what he has done to me!
I have known him for seven years, and always he
semed a grave, learned man who came to talk to me
about books —and it wasn't about books he came, and
where am I in the story ? I wanted to write cheer-
fully about it, and I can’t—l lose so much.
The two young people that caused these
paternal tears to flow have in turn known
what it is to lose a daughter in similar cir-
cumstances, and are grandparents to-day.
Harry Skugg, conductor of the Malvern
Tramways Band, was a proud man entirely
when a recent meeting at Malvern sub-
scribed £2OOO in a few minutes to show
their faith in the world-tour project. Shugg
gained a reputation as conductor of the Gee-
long Harbor Trust Band, and during the
time he has been waving the baton in Mal-
vern the Tramways Band has never been
defeated. After waking the echoes of the
Empire Exhibition the band will tour
France, Belgium and Britain before contest-
ing the championship of Britain at Man-
chester and the world’s championship at
the Crystal Palace in September, 1924. Gib-
son Young is to business-manage the tour.
At the umpteenth show of the Arts and
Crafts, now overflowing the Town Hall
supper-room, the goods furnish ample proof
that the society is still busy wedding art
and utility. It has thus helped to trample
down the awfulness of defacing good mir-
rors with atrocious paintings and destroy-
ing the comfort of sofa-cushions with florid
embroiderings. One clever ex-penwoman,
Henrietta McGowan Walker, will go down
in history as the discoverer of the possi-
bilities of stringy-bark. Her little lot is a
big draw at the Exhibition. Surgeon Fred
Bird’s wife —of the Western District
Hopkins clan—displays some yards of grey
material which she made straight from the
sheep, and Mrs. Ossie Syme has a child’s
frock created from silk she had acquired
direct from the cocoon. Florence Whitney
feelingly demonstrates that the machine-
made article is vulgar compared with the
hand-stitched, more especially when it comes
to the habiliments of his royal highness
The Baby. No self-respecting woman who
has glimpsed the basket-making section will
henceforth think of using the imported
article. Trantham Fryer has been adding
to the interest of the show each Friday
afternoon by modelling in clay.
A little gossip from Adelaide:—
The Cohens’ mayoral ball was by far the best of
the many fine shivoos they have given. Decorations
were white and gold, as befitted a golden-wedding
affair, with an occasional glimmer of rose by way
of relief. Great golden bells hung from the ceilings
of the main hall and the annexe, 4000 yards of white
and gold muslin formed a canopy, veiled the lights
and turned the gallery pillars into fluted columns.
Mrs. Cohen was in gold tissue and lace with touches
of royal blue, and Lady Bridges sported shrimp-pink
chiffon velvet. Miss Murray and the Barwell dame
"’ere in black; Miss Barwell was in primrose and
cinnamon; Miss Judge in Early-Victorian black; Mrs.
Legh Winser in white; and Miss Prior (of the Girl
Guides) in cinnamon georgette.
There have been a couple of talked-of country
dances—one at Angaston, with the Ronald Angases as
host and hostess, and the other at Morgan, given by'
Mrs. Leslie Dean and Mrs. Sidney Dunk. Town visi-
tors went up in batches to both. Nearer home the
Osborne Hall was the scene of a ball that had Mrs.
E. M. Heath as hostess and daughter Hilary as guest
of honor, the former in blue and gold brocade and
the latter in pale blue georgette; and the Winter
Club and the Palais have been booming, too, with
Mrs. Edmund Bowman hostessing one of the biggest
parties at the former.
Even the deluge that disorganised tram and train
services and piled up a foot or two of silt in houses
in the low-lying western suburbs couldn’t keep
music-lovers from the S. Aus. Orchestra’s second
concert, so the Town Hall was filled even unto the
organ galleries. Lady Bridges was there (she rarely
misses a concert) with Miss Judge; and others who
turned up were the Harold Davieses and Walenns,
Mrs. Charles Dashwood and Mrs. Angas Johnson,
Miss Amand Wright, Dr. Gerald Hayward and the
AV. A. Magarey and Hack matrons.
At the Conservatorium Students’ Concert, a couple
of nights later, the outstanding items were a flute
solo by' Constance Pether and Mrs. Wauchope’s sing-
ing.
The estate of the late J. AA r . Bakewell, sworn at
£63,700, goes to his wife and daughters. Mrs.
Bakewell and her elder daughter, Mrs. Evelyn
O’Leary, have been living in England for some
time. The younger daughter married one of the
Gould clan from Maori land and has made her home
in the Dominion.
There was a tea at Government House the other
day to meet Miss Prior and hear her speak on Gill
Guiding. Mrs. Teesdale Smith. Miss Gillum, Mrs.
Cecil Fisher, Mrs. Ernest Good, Mrs. McMahon Glynn
Mrs. J. P. Moriee and a considerable sprinkling of
the y'ounger set did the listening.
Mrs. Hilary Boucaut, daughter of the George Hiles
who once owned Munjibbie station, and widow of a
one-time well-known lawyer, died a few days ago.
Mrs. Boucaut took a keen interest in the birth of
the new C. of E. Girls’ Grammar School at Glenelg
and was a member of one of its committees.
The engagement of Princess Maud to Lord Carnegie
links a one-time Governor of this State with Royalty.
The Bosanquets’ nephew, Major Rivers Bosanquei,
married Lady' Katherine Carnegie, and so is a
brother-in-law of Princess Maud’s fiance.

This TUDOR Battery IS NOT of the House- or Farm-lighting type. It is the largest
battery in the Commonwealth,/has a capacity of 9000 ampere hours when discharged
in three hours, and forms part of the Plant of the Sydney Municipal Council Electricity
Department.
TUDOR Batteries for HOUSE- and FARM-LIGHTING SETS embody the same
principles of design and manufacture as are applied to our largest Power Batteries.
They are built to give a maximum life at a minimum expenditure for maintenance.
The result is a HOUSE-LIGHTING BATTERY that is unequalled for long service
and reliability. ..
If your present battery is not giving you satisfaction, install a TUDOR and thereby
protect yourself against further Battery troubles.
When purchasing a House-lighting Set, insist on a TUDOR Battery equipment; they
last longer and keep you free from worry. Over fifty municipalities and towns in
Australia have installed TUDOR BATTERIES in their Lighting Stations.
TUDOR BATTERIES ARE MADE IN ENGLAND.

MICK SIMMONS
DO THE JOB
PROPELY
National candidates were prominent in
the races over the sticks and the solider obstacles on
the wet Williamstown . (Vic.) course. The Bendigo-
trained Bendoe (7 to 2) had his neck in front ot
Mnemar (s’s) at the finish of the Port Phillip Hurdle,
but was lucky in getting a late run on the inside,
Mnemar hanging out. The latter looks the likelier
sort of horse for the three-mile journey at Fleming*
ton, more especially as he will have 121 b. less to
carry than the lOst. 121 b. he humped on Saturday.
Jackstaff (6’s) was a close third and the fourth
horse was the S.A. visitor Argosy Boy (9 to 2),
who is decidedly useful and is certain to be improved
by the race. The £4OO Steeple went to the 6-to-4
favorite Warlock, who outstayed Thaletas (9 to 4)
over the last bit, the third horse lumbering in 100
yards behind Thaletas. When a green four-year-old,
Warlock fought out a magnificent finish with Monrose
in the big A..J.C. steeplechase. He is now trained
by N. D. Godby, who has Liberate under his care,
and having already been successful over the Fleming-
ton timber, his National chance cannot be ignored.
* * * #
At Randwick on June 4 Dialogue (Demos-
thenes—-Tete-A-Tete) made all the running in the 13-
furlong Winter Stakes, and had the infant on top
been able to kick him along over the last 100 yards
he would have
ruined the big
bets on Purser.
With M u n r o
aboard, 7st.
61b. to car-
ry, nearly
three fur-
longs less
to travel,
and only
m o d prates
to beat, Bailie’s
horse looked a fail
thing for the
.£2OO handicap at
Canterbury Park
(N.S.W.), yet his
odds were 4 to 1
in a field of seven.
He led all the
way, and won
nicely by a neck
from Kilkee and
the expensive
Blaekadder, who
has been wildly
over-boomed.
ABEL HYDE,
A. J. C. stipendiary
steward.
Ted Morley, M.L.A. for Barwon, says he
will have another shot at legalising the tote when
Vic. Parliament reassembles on July 11. He
thinks that ■ the abolition of concession betting will
help him, and intends to bid for the votes of
Premier Lawson, McPherson and others, by proposing
the extinction of T. Rook in five years. When the
division was taken on his Tote (plus Tommy) Bill
in August, 1922, it was defeated by 41 to 15. To
get a bare majority of the House he will need
to convert 18 opponents, and the task is beyond
any private member, though a Premier might do it.

“Snow”: Within a week of his arrivai
in Sweden “Slip” Carr, the East Sydney sprinter,
won a 100-metres race in 10 9-10 sec., which is
equal to even time. He ran away with another
event in 11 l-10see., Gale, the Victorian, being
second. Paddock’s time for the 100 metres at the
1920 Olympic Games was 10 4-ssee., about a yard
better than evens. Australia doesn t own a recog-
nised world’s champion in any branch of athletics,
but in Carr it will possess one presently if he keeps
away from the primrose path.
* * * *
“Spikes”: Victoria has a future Olympic
rep. in Geo. Hyde, the 17-year-old Melbourne har-
rier, who romped in ahead of 200-odd others in the
five-mile junior championship at Caulfield. Last year,
when he captured a three-mile race for Vic. cadets,
he showed such form that there was a wild scramble
among club secretaries to sign him up. Melbourne
got the youth and handed him over to Bob Chalmers,
the one-time Maoriland pro., who coached the A.I.P.
team which competed at Paris in 1919. The Royal
Blues haven’t had a more promising bit of stuff
since the days of George Blake.
# » * *
“Mirza”: But I never claimed, as “Pick”
avers 1 did (B. 7/6/’23), that Lester Kelly was the
only Australian athlete to jump higher than 6ft.
I said he was the only Australian amateur to do so.
Two lilywhites, A. H. Scott (N.S.W.) and Eric
Russell (Vic.), have cleared 6ft., and, given favor-
able conditions, Harbison (N.S.W.) will doubtless set
new Australian figures. Many professionals have better
records than 6ft. As long ago as 1891, one, M. A.
Conroy, jumped 6ft. sin. at a Melbourne competition.
Beeson’s 6ft. 7 5-16 in. is the world’s best for either
amateur or pro.
* * * *
“Goondi”: The recent Uni. boatrace, in
which Brisbane once more donkey-licked the southern
crews, provided fresh evidence of the race-destroying
effects of the North Australian climate. G. W. Hard-
ing, who pulled No. 4 in the winning boat, was
born at Innisfail, on the Johnstone River (N.Q.),
and lived there for the first eight years of his life.
Then he spent three years in Papua. After that
the pallid victim of the tropics came south to
Maryborough and a creditable scholastic career, fie
won a Government scholarship and passed the junior
and senior Uni. exams., capturing, in the latter, the
State bursary.
* # # *
“The Deacon”: When Brother Edwin
went out suddenly at St. Joseph’s College, Hunter’s
Hill (N.S.W.), amateur sport lost an enthusiastic
worker. Born in England, Brother Edwin’s early
life was spent with his soldier-father at Paddington,
where, as clubmate of Charlie and Alec Bannerman,
he was responsible for some fine cricket scores.
After the Church collected him in 1872, his energies,
both in culture and sport, were divided between
M.L. and N.S.W. Of late years no man has done
more to spread the cult of amateurism among the
boys of the Great Public Schools. He was 74 when
Time was called.
* * * *
Arthur Havers, a 25-year-old English pro.,
won the open golf championship with a score of
295, beating Hagen, the American, who was success-
ful in 1922, by a stroke. McDonald Smith, another
Yank, was third with an aggregate of 297, and Kirk-
wood’s 298 earned him fourth money. The Austra-
lian gave his now-familiar exhibition of brilliance
and unsoundness. In the words of one disgusted
critic he “threw away a championship that was virtu-
ally in his pocket.” Heading the field in the last
round, as a result of some superb strokes, he took
five at the 14th hole, six at the 15th, and seven at
the 16th, playing like a flustered novice. He went
to pieces in the same way at Sandwich last year.
* * * *
The S. Aus. and Vic. Cricket Associations
have turned down the request of Queensland to be
included in Sheffield Shield matches. There will
now be a conference of the State bodies concerned,
but Queensland’s chances of admission are far from
rosy. On recent form the Bananalanders have just
as good a right to compete for the shield as the
Soustralians. Rather better, in fact.
* * * •
“Centurion” : The Oxford cricket team has
a strong Australian leaven. In addition to Betting-
ton, the old King’s School boy, who is captain, it
includes H. O. Hopkins, who was captain of the
Oxford lacrosse sidle last season, and R. P. B. Bar-
bour, of the famous N.S.W.-Q. cricket family. Hop-
kins, who hails from Victoria, got his cricket Blue
last year but missed the Cambridge match through
an injury.
• • * »
Conceding 71b. to the Victorian Al. Moore
at the Sydney Stadium, Mendies, the little Portugee
from Pyrmont, stopped him in the 17th round. The
Melbourne lad was game, but he isn’t much class,
and the small crowd didn’t go into raptures over
the exhibition.
* * * *
“Snow”: Hock Keys, who died the other
day, was one of the cleverest boxers that ever
pulled on a glove in a Sydney ring. He had a
wonderful left hand and was as fast as lightning
on his feet. But, like most latter-day Australian
pugs., he lacked a knock-out punch. Mainly for
that reason his U.S. tour in 1907 was a failure, but
he went 17 rounds with Freddie Welsh.
* * * *
“Schnorrer”: Is the boxing supremacy of
the planet passing to the Jews? In England a
Jewish team won the cadet championship for the
second time in three years. Jewry knocked out all
comers in 1921, lost by two points to Lancashire in
1922, and triumphed again in April by 4 points.
Benny Leonard, whom many Yanks regard as the
greatest lightweight of all time, is a Jew; so is
“Kid” Lewis, who has been feather-, light-, welter-
and middleweight champion of England; so was
Otto Cribb, the best natural fighter Australia has
seen in the last quarter of a century, Les Darcv
excepted. Leonard is a likeable chap. Once when
he was on a long journey, an aggressive-looking
person entered his carriage and demanded to know
if there were any Jews there. It looked like a
Yid-baiting incident, but Benny kept quiet until the
stranger repeated his question. Then the champion
explained who he was. There was no fight. The
inquirer was a Jew himself, and was merely looking
for another to make up a “Minyon”—a service
which Jews can hold anywhere if they can secure a
“Minyon,” or quorum.
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp” ; The private history of
a boxing contest of not so long ago has never been
written. One of the parties was a pug. who, spend-
ing little, had amassed a fair wad during his time
in the ring, but became smitten with the charms of
a lady who abhorred fighting. Marrying her, he
invested his money in a suburban business, and
solemnly promised her that his fighting days were
done. But the management he had fought for got
into desperate trouble owing to the illness of a
bruiser for whom a mill had been arranged. The
ex-pug. was appealed to as an old pal to help the
situation througn, and was too good-natured to
refuse. On the understanding that the substitution
would not be announced until the last possible
moment, he trained hard, and directly the news
was published absented himself from home. The
fight proved a horrible fiasco. Mrs. Stousher eluded
the officials who had been told off to keep her
away and made a violent scene at the gate. The
fatal intelligence of her arrival having reached him
in his dressing-room, Stousher lost his nerve and
took a fearful hiding from a man whom, but for
being unmanned by thoughts of the homecoming
that awaited him, he would have polished off in
a few rounds. “You can never understand women,”
he said morosely, telling me the story. “The missus
was dead set against me fightin’; but w’en they
took wot was left of me ’ome that night, ‘A nice,
boxer you are,’ she starts, ‘lettin’ yourself get
licked by a lizard like that!’ An’ I’ll never ’ear
the end of it, I s’pose.”

W. T. Parata, whose presentment appears
herewith, is the unchallenged king of Maori Union
football and rules his
amateur kingdom with
a strong hand. Of
the five Maori teams
that have visited Aus-
tralia in the last 35
years he has raised
and bossed four—
those of 1910, 1913,
1922, and the present
combination. Parata
was the proudest man
in the southern hemi-
sphere when his Maoris
won the rubber in
1922. The dream of
his life is to take a
Maori XV to England.
On the form shown
last year and last
Saturday they would
beat more than would
beat them.
In the hardest
and most exciting
game of football
played at Sydney this
season, N. S. Wales
beat the Maori Rugby
Unionists by 27 points
to 23. The Maoris
blamed the referee for
their defeat. Some of
his decisions were certainly questionable, but
no one can say that he didn’t help to make
the thing fast. The visitors’ 2-3-2 scrum was more
successful than the Cornstalks’ 3-2-3. In the line-
out work, too, Tureia’s men were superior. Mill,
their little half-back, was the pick of the 30; his
screw-running has seldom been surpassed on a Sydney
ground. Tureia (captain), a husky five-eighth, was
great in defence. Their most noticable helpers were
Piena, a tricky five-eighth, Potaka (centre) and, among
the forwards, Bannister and Walker. Raymond, the
Rhodes scholar and N.S.W. winger, came into pro-
minence early in the piece by intercepting a Maori
rush and getting over with a grand run. He did
nothing equal to that afterwards, but his work
was always good. Nothling, the full-back, kicked
three fine penalty goals, but missed chances that
were easier. _ Crossman, Elliott and big Tancred,
who has played the Union and League codes in both
the Commonwealth and the Dominion, were other
conspicuous members of a strong and speedy side.
Some of the Maoris and one or two N. S. Welshmen
will need to have their tempers under better control
in the second match, which is to be played on
Saturday, and in the final tussle on Monday. In
other respects a splendid standard of play was
attained in the first encounter, and the series will give
the old game a welcome lift.
Those who had prophesied that South
Sydney would gallop away with the League premier-
ship were considerably astonished on Saturday when
Western Suburbs defeated South with ease. West
scored 31 points (7 tries 5 goals) to 10 points (2
tries 2 goals), South going to pieces in the last
20 minutes. McMillan, the winners’ custodian, com-
pletely outplayed the veteran Hallett, who had had no
small share in South’s victory over Balmain. And
there were few more vigorous players on the ground
than 88-year-old “Tedda” Courtney, who scored the
last try of the day. Two of the other matches also
provided surprises, Glebe accounting for Balmain
(7 to 5) and St. George for the neighboring New-
town club (14 to 12). South and North are now
level at the top, two points ahead of West and East,
with Uni. at the bottom. The students have played
seven matches and lost the lot. Presumably their
time will come.
**, * *
“Centurion”: “Leagueite” accuses me of
talking through my hat (B. 14/6/’23) for saying
League football is a professional game, and adds that
“no game is professional, though those that play
it may be.” Weil, R.U. law expressly bans any foot-
baller knowingly playing with or against “any foot-
ball organisation declared by the Union to be a
professional body.” The same rule applies to foot-
ball clubs, and the League game was deciared a
professional organisation over 30 years ago. “League-
ite’s” claim is further squashed by the fact that
the Uni. League club has included two men who
have been paid for playing. This alone would brand
their associates in the team as pro’s until reinstated
by the body whose rules they offended—in this
case the R.U. As it is, the Sydney University team
is doubly in the professional soup. As for the
grant of “Blues” to the members of Brisbane and
Uni. League teams by the Australian Universities
Sports Union, it may be pointed out that the grant
commands no recognition outside Australia—and
very little here. The delegates of the Sydney Sports
Union, which does not recognise the League team,
opposed the thing, but were overborne by the repre-
sentatives of States where football amateurism is not
highly regarded. It is “Leagueite” who has been
using his lid for a megaphone.
“Wodgil”: A Sydney Uni. proposal for a 10s. 6d.
levy, the proceeds to be devoted to the maintenance
of the ’Varsity Oval and the furtherance of amateur
sport, enabled the pro-League undergraduates to make
an effective demonstration. Assembling in force,
they rejected a motion in favor of the levy, and
passed a vote of censure on the committee of the
Sports Union. They have certainly a right to pro-
test against being taxed for the upkeep of an en-
closure which they are not permitted to use. Still,
it was an unfortunate day for Uni. sport when they
threw in their lot with the League. Their club
has fared so badly this season that stern and unbend-
ing Leaguers talk of “parssin’ it out” next year.
Also, by its association with hard-jawed gents, whose
main consideration is the gate, it was involved in
the rotten business of inducing the Maoris (fruit-
lessly, as it happened) to transfer their allegiance
from a game which they played for the love of it
to one which they would play for money. That
was an utterly discreditable chapter in the history
of Australian sport.

At Sydney on Saturday the Maoriland
Soccer players avenged their defeat at Brisbane by
kicking 3 goals to Australia’s 2. They deserved
their victory, for they had distinctly the better of
a fast and willing game. George Campbell, their cap-
tain and centre-forward, got all three goals, and
was a tower of strength, his ground-work and short
passing delighting the connoisseurs from England,
who contributed largely to the £794 gate. Alick
Gibb and Cartwright were about the best of the
Australians, some of whom spoilt their work by self-
ishness. They will have to adopt other tactics if
the side is to win the rubber at Newcastle (N.S.W.).
* * * *
Although it was a wet afternoon 100,000
devotees of the Australian game saw the League
matches in Melbourne on Saturday, a large propor-
tion being present at Essendon’s demolition of Mel-
bourne. The ’Dons were the faster team, and kicked
more accurately, so they booted 11 goals 8 behinds
to 8 goals 12 behinds. But the Fuchsias, instructed
by Collingwood’s ex-rover, Percy Wilson, are coming
along, and, if they stick to their work, will be there-
abouts at the finish. Carlton, on the other hand,
are going from bad to worse. This time Colling-
wood licked them by 75 points to 50. To reach
the finals the Old Blues will have to win every
remaining game, an almost impossible feat, although
they have been scouring the State for new men.
Fitzroy romped over St. Kilda, scoring 74 points
to 38 ; and Geelong lost to Richmond by 50 points
to 50, mainly through wild kicking. On a charge
of having accused an umpire of bias a St. Kilda
official has been disqualified from holding any office
in the League during that body’s pleasure. The dis-
barred person threatens to appeal to the law.
“Wink”: Recent mention of Bert Franks
recalls the genial brutality of “Joker” Cameron, his
co-worker in South Melbourne’s ruck. Though, guilty
of as many acts of violence in the field as h'alf-a-
dozen ordinary players “Joker” was popular with
opponents and spectators alike. He took and gave
hard clouts with the utmost cheerfulness. When
cornered with the ball he would clench a fist and
frown horribly, which threatening motions often
made the other chap pause for a moment. Then
“Joker” would get his kick —and grin hugely. When
he received a knock his vengeance was swift. The
first opponent he met—large or small, guilty or inno-
cent —would collect an elbow in the ear, a knee in
the back or something else to remember him by. Often
the injured one protested that the treatment was quite
uncalled for. “I know,” “Joker” was wont to explaip,
“but one of youse blokes gave me a beaut, and I’m
passin’ it on.”
“Tren” : In the early days of Australian
football, simplicity was the aim and boast of its
enthusiasts. It was claimed that after five minutes’
instruction any stranger with a stout heart and a
fleet foot could play without danger of breaking
the rules. It was the conditions that made the
game hard for players. Across the gravel surface
of the Melbourne Football Ground ran a gully, and
a clump of trees grew in the fairway. Despite these
drawbacks this was, even then, the haunt of the
aristocratic athlete, who, unable to boast of the
playing-ground, skited about the appointments. By
alteration the cricket pavilion was made to right-
about-turn, and was used as a football grandstand,
the playing area being enclosed by a rope strung to
posts. Other teams played in open paddocks with-
out protection from onlookers, who often crowded
around them, and by threats and violence prevented
their doing their best. For this reason all clubs
found it difficult to muster a full team when play-
ing away from home. Richmond (Tigers even then)
was a dreaded spot, and often games were aban-
doned there because the opposing team declined to
play the ball and fight the larrikins in the same
stride. Collingwood, too, over 60 years ago, used
tactics resembling to-day’s. Allowed, like Richmond,
five extra men —20 to 15 —they used these spares
to develop a crude system, and wonder was always
expressed that such a thin, weedy lot could put up
such splendid battles against opposing giants.
* * * *
“Ex-Englishman”: History soon degen-
erates into legend. Possibly Wills (B. 31/5/’23) did
evolve the Australian code in Victoria —though ic
seems to have developed quite independently in
South Aus. But that he did it out of a sort of
kindly regard for the “working classes” is obvious
nonsense. Who, going out to play a game, thinks
about a “class,” or about anything but his compan-
ions of the moment? There can, I think, be no
doubt that the Australian code was simply a com-
promise necessary to enable the few enthusiasts to
get a game at all. The pioneers of football would
all have played in England. Codes were not nearly
so rigid then; I myself can remember a time when
Sheffield and Birmingham, each claiming to play
the only genuine Soccer, could arrange a meeting
only by allowing Yorkshire rules to prevail before
half-time and the slightly-different Midland rules
after. But certainly there would be the broad and
unbridgable Rugby v. Soccer gulf among those who
first went out to kick a ball in Australia, and dis-
sension must arise instantly. Compromise alone
could settle it. Under the cross-bar, or over, to
score a goal? “Oh well, let’s have no cross-bar at
all.” Handling, or none? “Well, let the man run
with it just far enough to get his kick” (bouncing
the ball and running on was a later discovery).
Eleven aside, or 15 ? “There are a lot waiting to
play; make it 20 for the present.” And how about
standing offside? “Oh, let ’em stand where they
like. Come on, or else it will be dark before we
get started.” That’s how things would develop
between young men out for exercise, rather than
by one young man sitting down to legislate for the
“working classes.”
* * * *
South Australia has arranged to extend
its inter-State football programme by giving West-
ralia home-and-home matches every year. The first
of them, played in Adelaide, was entirely spoiled by
rain. The Oval was a mass of mud, in which both
sides slipped and fell. On the day. there was only
one side in it: S.A. won by 10 goals 13 behinds to
3 goals 5 behinds. The return match will take place
in Perth next month, and the Westralians hope to
show that, playing at home, thev are as superior
as they proved themselves in the “carnival” of 1921.

“ ‘Battling Siki’ professes himself disgusted with
boxing and everything connected with it. He has
decided to abandon the game and take up lion-
training.”—Cable.
He is tired, disillusioned barbarian
Prom Afric’s uncivilised shore,
Of the Stadium’s clamor vulgarian,
Of the Ring with its roar and its gore.
He is weary of razzle and riot,
Of ingrates who flatter and rob.
He’s after, in fine, some more quiet
And placid a job.
He has heard the tumultuous thunder
Of cheers—and disparagement’s howl—
Acclaimed as a world-beating wonder
Or outed with hoots on a foul.
Now a god—now an idol that’s busted—
He’s given and taken his knocks.
And at last he’s supremely disgusted,
Ped up with La Boxel
Th<? ruffians who ramp and who ravage,
The bruisers who batter and brawl,
They grate on the soul of the savage
From the jungles of far Senegal.
In Paris the vicious and venial,
They irk him, the fights and the feasts;
He deems he will find more congenial
Communion with beasts.
In fraudulent contests and tricky
No more he’ll adventure his frame.
Dead-sick of the cestus is Siki
And all that pertains to the game.
The guerdons of sinews and science
To champions white he’ll resign—
And take up the training of lions
As more in his line.

THE INKY WAY.
“Joseph A.” : W. J. McWilliams has just completed
60 years’service on the Hobart Mercury. Joining the
paper nine years after it started, he has been with it
ever since. He is a prominent member of local horti-
cultural societies, and at 76 has lost none of his skill
in dealing with slugs of either variety.
“Bret Vane”: Unlikely places where the old pink
cover’s been found ? On a trek towards Bagdad
we were approaching the Tak-i-Garra pass (it
brought Alexander’s army to the plains before ours)
and surprised some of- the local aristocracy scan-
ning a copy of the paper. This was on the borders
of Kurdistan.
“P.A.L.”: The exodus of pressmen from M.L.
continues. Cables arrived on one day for four Wel-
lington inky-waysters offering them jobs on Sydney's
imminent new daily. Will Lawson left a few weeks
ago, and following him in a few days are Les Free-
man (N.Z.) Times), Guy Natusch (Post) and Eric
Marshall (Dominion). It isn’t safe to mention Aus-
tralia to a M.L. newspaper proprietor just now.
“Hamer”: Apparently the Henry Lawson Memorial
Fund committee has gone to sleep. Or else it has
failed to realise that the people who most loved Law-
son are not those who can send cheques. The best
way to push it would be to distribute subscription-
list forms throughout Australia —to the country
Schools of Arts, for instance, And to the pubs, in
both places there are many people who will be glad
of the opportunity to pass in their small subs., but
would never consider them worth forwarding individu-
ally by post. It is rather disheartening to see the
memorial lagging for the want of a little organising.
“F.T.Ii.”: My experience re The Bulletin's
strange and far-flung resting places. Early in 1916
1 was in Helouan, Egypt, and was to be presented
to the Coptic Patriarch, Pope Cyril V. The particu-
lar business of his Holiness in Helouan was to
anoint (in advance) the successor to the throne of
Abyssinia, a ceremony that was strictly private.
While waiting for the interview the Patriarch’s valet,
an Abyssinian with a slashed face, showed me into
what was evidently meant for a study, and indicated
a Pile of newspapers that might while away the
tedium of waiting. There were dozens of Greek,
Arabic and French publications, and three in English
—the Egyptian Times, London Punch and The
Bulletin.
“Bolo’i: For villainous ealigraphy the three chain
pion pressmen I have met were G. W. Steevens, the
brilliant scholar and war correspondent who died of
enteric during the siege of Ladysmith; A. G. Hales;
and Harry Peters, Australian correspondent of the I.on-
don Times. Steevens’s penwork was so cramped and
microscopic that, he might have written the Lord s
Prayer on a postage-stamp; Hales was and still re-
mains the despair of comps.; and Peters has held the
Australian belt successfully against all-comers for
years. The last-named, when a sorely puzzled reader
brought back a slip that had floored all hands,
pondered over it for a while, smiled and said reassur-
ingly: “Follow the context, old man, and you’ll be
all right!”
“Jim G.”: A par I happened on about the projected
publication of the verses of Harry Morant (“The
Breaker”) set me thinking of the time I camped
with him, many years ago. It was at Job’s Gate, on
the Queensland border, about 15 miles west of Good-
ooga. Morant did not write very much, but he
read a lot —when he could get it. He wasn’t much
of a mate, as bush mates go, or much of a bushman
either. He had a vein of contempt for-Australians,
especially workers, which he took little trouble to
bide. All the same, he had some fine qualities, in-
cluding his love for a good horse. When leaving
Job’s Hut he nailed two polo sticks crosswise in one
of the rooms. Eight years later, when I called, they
were still there. I am wondering if they are there
yet.
“McTrochus”: The cables announce the appearance
in London of “Patrolling in Papua,” by W. R. Hum-
phries,. a member of the Papuan magistracy and
writer of many crisp Bulletin stories of island life.
Humphries has done much wandering in Papua. One
little jaunt he can tell of was from Nepa, Lake-
kamu Goldfield, across the Mt. Chapman Range-Tile
watershed of the Waria and Kunimaipa rivers into
former German New Guinea; followed by a stroll
from Morobe across the island to Moresby, and thence
overland via Hall Sound to his starting-point. The
trials and: tribulations of the lone-hand official in the
wilderness, and the wonderful success of the locally-
trained public service in opening up the vast terri-
tory for Law and Order, should make interesting
reading even .to those blatant gong-beaters who have
lately grabbed so much cheap publicity for their “ex-
plorations.”
“H.E.H.”: When the Salv’armv .swept uproariously
into the hamlet of Queanbeyan (N.S.W.) in
the early hours of a Sabbath morn some-
where in the mid-’eighties, the astonished
populace voted the ambidextrous drummer the
star turn of the outfit. W. J. O’Neill (whose
father was then engaged in tri-weeklying the local
Times) charcoaled above the kitchen mantel a crude
sketch of the drummer seated on an imaginary plat-
form and violently in action. Whereupon Victor
J. Daley—at that' time a guest of the O’Neills—
after viewing the disfigurement with silent amuse-
ment, proceeded to supply the inscription:
“Give me, O Lord, in realms of bliss
No measly harp to strum,
But let me sit and bang like this
An everlasting drum.”
It was long years before any other vandal was
permitted to erase either the picture or the poetry.
“Corrie”: Met Smiler Hales in high glee one after-
noon in the London Press Club. He had dined the
previous evening with Hulton, of Manchester,
who at that time was regarded as a sort of
Northeliffe of the Midlands. During the meal
Hales undertook to write for Hulton’s papers the
life of Peter Jackson, the pugilist. “When the
entr6e came on,” said Smiler, “he offered me 30 bob
a thousand words, but I got him going, and by the
tinie we cracked the walnuts he clinched at three
quid a thousand.” Some weeks later Hales was in
the club looking a picture of contentment. “How’s
Peter going?” I inquired. “Fine,” he said emphati-
cally. “I’ve written 10,000 words, and am only
teaching the young blighter to swim among ihe
sharks in Sidney Harbor. I haven’t put his hands
up vet. By the time I screw him down he ought to
have panned out about 300,000!”
“Middle Blue”: “Cecil Warren” (B. 7/6/’23) say>
Randolph Bedford seems to “us women” like an elc-.
phant in a bric-a-brac bazaar. Well, here’s one
woman'to whom he seems rather like the best short-
storv writer of all now that Henry Lawson has
o-one. I’ll’have his man, woman and baby—big and
red and fat and honest as he makes it—before any-
thing Amcric'a and England are now producing, wrap-
ped up in the cotton-wool of style and workman-
ship and psvehology and all the rest of it. Bedford’s
baby kicks and crows in healthy sunshine, and is not tin
superannuated animal the American baby has become.
Not is it the pinafored infant of Britain. I have a
quarrel with Bedford, however. It is this. He is
too frank. You cannot read Bedford aloud to a mixed
audience —not his best work. If he would only take
his baby and read aloud his stories to it he would
’know why he is not as famous in England and
America as he is in Australia.
A PROTEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This Saturday, of all days in the week,
Is joyless and forbidding of aspect:
For on this day, to make my study sleek
And trim, a dozen peaceful hours lire wrecked.
A very caveman, driven from his lair,
Will mutter and contract his shaggy brows.
Why not ? —the eouch of bloody-bones and hair
Contents him, and his simple need allows.
So from untidy dens we poets are
All dustered out in name of decency";
The besom is abroad both near and far.
A foe that hath no bowels. As for me,
I love disorder. Yea, I love it well
And think the smell of it a goodly smell.

All the conventions of pre-War comic
opera are recalled by “Sybil,” which
has been haying its first-in-Australia
run at Adelaide Royal. Brody and
Martos and Jacobi started it, out
Vienna way, but Harry Graham and Harry
B. Smith have Americanised it for the Eng-
lish-speaking market. Sybil, a prima donna,
drops into Bomsk (somewhere in Russia)
with her manager and his wife. Paul, her
iover, has deserted his regiment to follow
her, and to save his life she has to pass for
a Grand Duchess whom the local Governor
is expecting. This is all very well till the
Grand Duke arrives; but he makes no
fuss—he is quite ready to accept the lady
for what she says she is. And that is all
very well till the real Grand Duchess drops
in. She sees what has happened, and takes
up Paul as a counter-stroke; and there is
the usual confusion over the lodging of the
various parties for the night. Meanwhile,
the manager’s wife has had to pass for
Sybil, and most of the fun comes from the
Governor’s attempts to get her to sing, and
his free love-making to her in her husband’s
presence.
Tallis, visiting Adelaide to help Myers
with this riot of color and costume, talked
much of its cost; and he was justified. Never
before have nil the girls in a comic opera
worn so much clothing. Furs and trains
and headgear elicit frequent gasps from tnat
half of the audience best fitted to judge. The
men’s uniforms are equally striking in their
way, and seldom have so gallant a brace of
lovers ns Chisholm and Claude Flemming
played “opposite” each other in an opera.
Gladys Moncrieff rises to a big chance, and
gets right out of the Spanish type in which
she has ' been specialising. Cecil Bradley
(with an odd look of Nellie Stewart) domi-
nates the stage after her late arrival. Sti-
gant gets most of the fun, as the manager,
especially over a machine which he takes to
be a bomb-thrower, but which in reality
illuminates the whole town and gives away
himself «and his partners in fraud. Leslie
Holland is more quietly funny, and is artist
enough to get a hearty laugh even for the
century-old jest, in a comic duel, about hits
outside a chalked line on the waistcoat ‘ not
counting.” A puzzling study is that of the
manager’s wife. She seems to have been
a charmer in the original, but to have been
Americanised into a sort of Connie Ediss

A rather surprising young American, Alan
Brooks, is engaging the close attention of
Sydney Tivoli audiences. He is not a Rotary
Club booster, neither does he carry iron-
mongery in his hip-pocket. He is merely
the author and principal actor in a little
three-scene sketch, “Dollars and Sense.” The
sketch has both wit and tense situations;
it moves rapidly from curtain-rise to cur-
tain-fall, the three scenes being set from the
beginning. Brooks owns an artistic restraint
lacking in most of the vaudeville showmen
of his country. Capable support is given by
his wife, Eileen Robinson, and Colin Hun-
ter and 11. S. Kurasaki. Dickens imper-
sonator Clement May appears in three new
rbles, Carton, Micawber and Little Nell’s
grandfather; and Herschel Henlere con-
tinues to give his best, and his best is worth
going a long way to hear. With these three
big turns the rest don’t matter. And they
don’t.

Tenor Walter Kirby ended his series of
recitals at Sydney King’s Hall midway
through last week to an outburst of real en-
thusiasm. The season has been marked by
well-arranged programmes, abounding in the
operatic arias which are Kirby’s trump card.
He included among his singing numbers
some charming verses by Elizabethan writ-
ers, Donne’s exquisite lines gaining a tre-
mendous round of applause. The death scene
from Verdi’s “Otello” and Gounod’s “Thou
Art My Sun” were other thrillers of an
artistic season. Henry Penn, Nina Roma
and Vern Barnett were accessories to the
success. Sydney is late in making Kirby’s
acquaintance, but his voice and his method
have already won him friends enough to
assure him a long run as a Harbor Front
concert-singer.

Oliver Twist, Fagin, Bill Sikes and Nancy
are “on” at Sydney Crystal Palace this
week. The part of Oliver is played by
Jackie Coogan, who makes a more robust
Oliver than others have done. But it is a
film worth seeing. At the Lyceum Sher-
lock Holmes has been resurrected, and twice
daily has a battle royal with Professor
Moriarty. John Barrymore is the person of
most importance. The supporting film is the
startlingly new story of a hard-up young
woman’s emergence into Sassiety. The
Strand features Bebe Daniels in_ “The
World’s Applause,” with Bebe climbing the
precarious ladder to limousines and furs.
There has been a shuffle among the minor
houses, with the result that Chaplin carries
his dinner-pail to the Rialto, “Lorna Doone”
enters the Empress’s stage-door and “Smilin’
Through” keeps the Majestic and Norma
Talmadge followers happy. Knighthood is
still in flower at the Strand and “The
Queen of Sheba” is turning money away at
the Town Hall.

Before leaving for the Empire Exhibition,
Thorpe McConville’s Wild Australia show
is putting in a few weeks at the Sydney
Hippodrome. Last Saturday night the big
Haymarket house was crammed with horse-
lovers, from apprentice jockeys to ancient
cabbies and venerable draymen. There was
also a small sprinkling of punters, surrep-
titiously laying the odds that the buckjump-
ing bull would toss the latest volunteer with-
in 30 seconds. No local tram straphanger
can ever hope to be half as comfortable as
the star buckjumpers of the show looked —
Billy Dodd, “Snowy” Carr and Stan Shep-
pard. But the risks the lady buckjumper,
Dorrie Phillips, takes must make her an un-
popular person with insurance agents. There
are the usual bucking ponies, mules and
donkeys, with a whip-cracker and other
accessories. In addition, any young Horatio
who can sit Warrigal for one minute can
have a tenner to help pay for his night’s out-
ing. It is a good show and Church-parade is
going to have something else to talk about
when McConville arrives in the neighborhood
of Hyde Park.

“Enter Madame” becomes exit, old girl, at

Saturday.

“The Faithful Heart” throbs its final beat
at Melbourne Palace on Saturday and a new
revue, “Rockets,” about which a lot of pre-
liminary pyrotechnics have been exploded, is
in preparation. The fact that the two Aus-
tralian girls Lorna and Toots Pounds, re-
cently entered at the Customs as “re-
imported,” are to star in the show seems an
earnest that it won’t prove a damp squib.
Exactly when “Rockets” will soar sky-
ward is at time of writing a dark managerial
secret.

Since “Mary” left on Saturday night the

appearance in Melbourne on Saturday next.

The guillotine has been at work on Hugh
Ward’s “Tangerine,” and those who go to
see the colorful affair at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s can stay for the last curtain with no
more than the ordinary risk of having to
camp in the Gardens till the first suburban
train leaves in the morning. The show gen-
erally has been considerably brightened up
since its opening night, though if still more
cutting were done it would be in no danger
of bleeding to death. Meantime the princi-
pals strive according to their lights to invest
the nebulous plot with substantiality, and
June Roberts’s toe-dancing is an airy joy.

The “Quarantine” flag is still gallantly
flying at Melbourne King’s. In its fluttering
shadow Lawrence Grossmith goes on making
love with a blase air, and Dorothy Seacombe
is disrobing with becoming modesty as here-
tofore. Lots of other people in Melbourne
have likewise been disrobing, and staying
disrobed much longer; but that’s the nU s
fault. It isn’t a virulent brand of the
sniffs that Melbourne has, but quite un-
pleasant enough to have an effect on some
of the theatres.
“Hamfat”: Ilignold (B. 7/6/’23) eom-
bined an exceptional talent for acting with a
poor head for business. When his lease, of
Her Majesty’s, Sydney, was about to expire,
he was faced with a demand for more rent.
The man was coining money, but with all
the weighty indignation of which he was

MAJESTY'S .

capable he declined to consider any increase
at all, and transferred to the Lyceum. But
the public has queer tastes in the matter of
playhouses. The change from Sydneys fore-
most theatre to one with vulgah traditions
of melodrama lost him the support of the
Very Best. He had been paying only £BO
per week for Her Majesty’s. The owners
wanted £ll2, and would probably have
accepted £lOO. George’s idea of theatre
values would make modern managers smile.
“G.A.C.”: “0.K.” (B. 17/5/’23) talks
about the fat small parts in Shakspeare with
wisdom. Is there a more sympathetic and
more effective part in “Macbeth” than that
of the. doctor in the sleep-walking scene? I
haven’t the play by me, but I can remember
his lines about “strange, unearthly things’
being abroad, and his final appeal, “God,
God, forgive us all!” They shine out like
a silver cross in the whole eerie scene. Then
take Gratiano in “The Merchant.” Every
line of the bluff fellow’s speech is full of
matter, and he can make you love him for
his gift of good friendship. Look, too, at the
love-lorn Sylvius in “As You Like It,” with
his despairing cry of “Phoebe, Phoebe,
Phoebe!” And half-a-dozen others. I don’t
think any Shakspearean can ever complain
of having a poor part.
“J.F.R.” (Lond.) : The first batch of full-
blooded American negroes and negresses
imported by Alfred Butt for his new “Rain-
bow” revue at the Empire have duly arrived
and completely failed. All they do is a plant-
ation medley of song and dance differing but
little from the old-time productions of burnt-
cork negro-minstrel cos. The only innova-
tion is in the matter of noise. These real
niggers keep up a deafening din all the time
they are on the stage. The scene fell flat
on the opening night, and since then Butt
has cut it down to less than 15 min-
utes. There are hundreds of performers un-
employed in London Avho with the aid of
burnt-cork and bear’s grease could have
done the scene far more acceptably and effec-
tively. It was thought that the out-of-work
pros. Would make a hostile demonstration,
but beyond a few cries nothing of that sort
transpired. A sensation was, however, cre-
ated by the principal low comedian. Jack
Edge, who came before the curtain and vehe-
mently protested that his part had been so
cut down that he was not allowed anything
like a decent show. He was hustled off by
stage-hands and promptly sacked for break-
ing his contract, one of the provisions of
which is that ho performer may address the
audience without the manager’s consent.
Last scene of all in “Chu Chin Chore.”
Removing the ashes of Oscar.
From a Cockney Poverty Point!—
Marie Tempest has put up the shutters at the
Duke of York’s and gone touring in the provinces.
While a good start is proverbially half the battle,
a disastrous Oiie is very difficult to retrieve, and
that has been Marie's misfortune. The first-night
failure of “Good Gracious, Annabelle” was a blow
frotti which her season never recovered. A new
generation Of playgoers has grown up in London
during Miss Tempest’s long years of absence in
Australia and America. That, no doubt, was a
factor.
Curtain-raisers have dropped out of fashion in the
modern theatre. Marie Lohr is making an effort to
revive them. In my young Australian days our
theatrical fare began with a one-acter at 7.30 j then
came a full-sized, four-act drama; after that there
was a lively farce, to send the audience home in
good humor. We got oiir money’s worth in those
times. Now we have to pay twice as much for half
the quantity.
Daphne Dollard is drawing the crowds to "The
Rainbow,” at the Empire. On second and wiser
thoughts Alfred Butt decided to give her the salary
she Originally demanded, and she came into the cast
a few nights after the start. The little Australian
promptly made good. Butt's repentance was largely
due, to the failure of the big band of niggers he
imported from America, They were the blackest
of black frosts.
“Yardley”: The father of George Rignold
owned a small theatre at Stretchley-street,
a suburb four miles out of Birmingham, and
there it was that George got his early train-
ing. Afterwards he joined a stock company
at the Birmingham Royal. A tour of Britain
followed, and when George returned to his
native town his bride appeared with him in
a play called “Amos Clarke.” But it wasn’t
much of a success. Rignold really made
his name when Charles A. Calvert broke
down while playing “Henry V.” George
lowered hfcnself into the kingly armor and
registered the hit of his life.
“Bismuth,” from a back seat :
A Melbourne symposium of actors’ vi£ws on critics
is almost unanimous in its childlike admiration for
the man who unfailingly hands out bouquets. The
symposers have little use for the fellow who some-
times launches a cloud of mustard-gas, though oue
theatrical light concluded that the scoundrel was
possibly “honest.” Now, nothing is more obvious
than that the dramatic critic who takes his job
seriously, and registers his opinion with all the wit,
force, and ingenuity that he can command, is inspired
by the highest sincerity. It does not pay him to
write criticism. Apart from the labor of composi-
tion—the comparative ease of concocting trite
generalisations is palpable to anyone in the business
—there is the stronger point that, as soon as he
develops a capacity for exposing follies and weak-
nesses, he begins to be disparaged as a crank who is
disagreeing with the majority for the sake cf
notoriety.
The truth is that the earnest, uncompromising
critic never gets any advertisement among the
multitude at large. A few may respect him for his
integrity and his aloofness from the conspiracies of
lunch- and tea-parties, where his weaker brethren
are inoculated against candor by some young star's
personal attractions, hut, generally speaking, he
ranks little higher than the police-court reporter who
is often turned on in emergencies to do his work.
Moreover, if he has any knowledge of the literature
of the stage and endeavors to keep abreast of the
movements and developments in drama, stuffing
himself with Dunsany, O’Neill, Schnitzler, Von
Hoffmansthal, and the rest, he passes for a pedant
among his lazier confreres, and is for ever damned.
There is nothing more certain than that a critic of
this kind carries on a thankless task against great
odds in Australia.
But I mustn’t overlook two compensating advantages.
He isn’t asked to sample the management’s bulk
whisky on first nights, and he is never invited to
meet actors and actresses in private. ;•

“Norbell”: Ivate Bishop, dead in London
at 75, played a queer medley of parts at
Her Majesty’s, Sydney, in 1895, her last
year in Australia. She was Martha to
Rignold’s Devil in “Faust” (she had been
his Marguerite once) ; Mrs. O’Brien in
“Shamus O’Brien” ; Sally Millett in “World
Against Her” ; Posie Pentland in “My Part-
ner” ; Mrs. Darlington in “Youth” ; Madame
Fourcanade in “Esther Sandraz,” and Zenobia
iii “A Scrap of Paper.” The last two were
with Arthur Dacre and Amy Roselle: Kate
and Amy had been the Violet and Mary of
the four-year run of “Our Boys” in London.
At Rignold’s benefit in September, ’95. Kate
Bishop made one of the crowd in the Forum
scene from “Julius Caesar,” while “Little
Marie Lohr,” her daughter, gave an exhibition
of club-swinging. Sydney Evening News
says Kate will be remembered as Mother
Guttersnipe in “The Mystery of a Hansom
Cab.” I think she will be better remembered
as the sweet and gentle heroine of scores
of “Called Backs” and “Romany Ryes,”
or as the gracious Portia, Helena and Mrs
Ford of Rignold’s Shakspearean productions.
THE NEEDFUL KEPT.
“Twenty years elapse before the next act.”
“Thank goodness, they’ll have time to im-
prove their acting by then.”
“C. Ockuey”: One of the first plays I
ever witnessed was H. J. Byron’s comedy,
“Our Boys,” during- its record run at London
Vaudeville. A companion piece, “The Girls,”
by the same author, followed it. In both
these offerings the “girls” were played by
.\larie Illington and the just-dead Kate
Bjshop. Strange that both of them were
destined to come to and make good in Aus-
tralia. The former—and perhaps the better
artist of the two —was here playing a dash-
ipg comic female in “The Whip.”
“Second Murderer”: Charles Kenningham
(B. 14/'G/’23) made a hit in "La Basoehe”
at the Royal English Opera House—after-
whrds the Palace, London, circa ’9l. Writ-
ten by Adolf Carrb and composed by Andrb
Messager, the thing was a genuine success,
but its uncouth label is against it. (It was in
this “La Basoche” that David Bispham
made his first appearance, and not in the
“Flying Dutchman,” as has been stated.)
After the final curtain at its premiere, Carre
and Messager came behind to shake hands
all round, but Messager, in a burst of Gallic
fervor, grabbed Ivenningham and kissed him
fervently on either cheek, to the accompani-
ment of a delighted “Oh. Charlie!” from all
the girls. “La Basoche” is never heard of
now, though operas not in the same musical
street with it still flourish.
“L.H.P.” : In the early ’eighties I saw a
company headed by the late Eloise Juno in
a round of plays at the Dunedin (M.Lj
Princess’s. The opening piece was “Jeanie
Deans,” a dramatised version of Scott’s
“Heart of Midlothian,” and it was followed
by “The Green Bushes,” “The Relief of
Lucknow,” “Rob Roy” and “The Flowers
of the Forest.” The night I was at “The
Green Bushes” Miami, in jumping from
the stage-cliff into the stage-river, hit the
bare boards with such a thud that an Irish-
man in the pit yelled, “Begob, the water
must be frozen.” Full-bodied old plays they
were, with plenty of action and honest senti-
ment, although our highbrows, I suppose, would
sneer at them now. Donald Dinnie, the
athlete, was among the performers, and
piper Gray, who later became father-in-law of
comedian Fred Bluett, blew lustily on the
bagpipes.
“Ancient Prompter” : “Katinka,” the musi-
cal concoction from America whose many
catchy numbers Australian playgoers know
almost by heart, has not yet been staged in
London. But it recently made its appear-
ance in quite a modest fashion in the Eng-
lish provinces, and the metropolis is to see
it next month. Strange how managers fight
shy of this piece. The Firm had it for
a long while before putting it on, and was
quite surprised when it turned out a winner.
“Gnarek”: Charles Austin, one of Ward’s
importations, used to do a minor turn in
East End halls, where his style of humor
had a piquant appeal to audiences who
knew he kept a pub rahnd abaht the Com-
mercial-road. Riding in a ’bus one day,
after a matinee at the Shoreditch ’all, he
noticed a “To Let” sign on the old Shore-
ditch police station. Struck with the comic
possibilities of such a place being run as a
commercial venture, he collaborated with the
late Wal Pink in the production of the
sketch “Parker, P.C.,” in which he made
the hit of his career. When Austin’s name
appears on London bills the words “Parker,
F.C.,” are added in brackets to remind
the short-memoried public of his chief title
to celebrity.
“Ex-Englishman”: Why did the Firm en-
gage both Beryl Bryant and Eve Gray to
play lead in “The Faithful Heart” (B.
31/5/’23) ? A girl in the prologue, and
that girl’s daughter in the play 20 years
or so later, seem destined by all the rules
of the stage to give one actress a chance to
show subtle differences noticeable through a
general resemblance. And that is how the
play has always been cast in London.
“J.F.11.” (Lond.) : Iu the ’eighties and
early ’nineties the American comedian Frank
M. Clark ran a vaudeville show in the Vic-
toria Hall, Bourke-street, Melbourne. Its
most alluring feature was a bevy of beauties
he called his “Silk Stockings,” and the shape-
liest limbs encased in the stockings were
owned by May Yohe, a kid from Pennsyl-
vania. May afterwards migrated to Lon-
don, where she scored a success in “Little
('hristopher Columbus” and other pieces of
the “coon” order, then the prevailing craze.
She married Lord Francis Hope, brother
and heir-presumptive of the Duke of New-
castle, but he spoilt her chance of wearing
a coronet by divorcing her. Little has been
heard of May since 1913, when she sang her
old “Honey, Ma Honey” song at London
Opera House, but the subjoined par. has
been going the round of the U.S. papers
May Yohe, who has had more ups and downs than
a public lift, is on her way back to the vaudeville
stage. She married a lord, ran away with the
soldier-son of an ex-Mavor of New York, married and
divorced him, sang in a cafe in San Francisco, married
another soldier, served as a nurse in Africa in the
war and worked as a charwoman in a Seattle ship-
yard. “I am like a rubber ball,” she declares. “The
harder I fall the higher T bounce.”
Clark, by the way, is a pitcher-actor in
America- —or was when last heard of. One
of his meritorious deeds was to bring out
Will Whitburn, whose sketches of the Col-
lingwocd larrikin of the period were unsur-
passably humorous. And, to complete the
history, Lord Francis Hope lives in a very
modest way at Dorking, in Surrey ; the old
home of the family, Deepdene, with its mag-
nificent gardens, has been turned into a
hotel. Between them the two Hopes, father
and son, are said to have got through about
a million and a half. After divorcing May
Lord Francis married an ex-Melbourne girl.
“1874”: “Theatregoer Since 1876” (B.
7/6/’23) is wrong in stating that Coppin
offered J. C. Williamson 140 p.w. when the
Williamsons came to Australia. Coppin,
then running Melb. Royal, had been bitten
badly by other Yank actors before the Wil-
liamsons arrived. Amy Stone, who slaught-
ered the part of Cigarette in “Under Two
Flags,” was an especially tragic specula-
tion. Amy crashed in 1874. Williamson
and Maggie Moore turned up in August of
that year. It w 7 as because Coppin would not
risk wages on “Struck Oil” that the fifty-
fifty agreement as to takings w 7 as arrived
at. It turned out a winner for both parties.
“Ancient Theatregoer” on playmaking:—
The Esson-Thmer-Lofting controversy about ex-
pressionism in drama reminds me *f a hit I made
once at a Saturday supper of the Whitefriars Club
in Anderton’s Hotel, Ludgate Hill, London. After
beefsteaks, stoups of wine and flagons of ale, Arthur
Bourchier, then playing Cardinal Wolsev at the
Haymarket with Beerbohm Tree, opened a discus-
sion on the proper objective of the playwright. What
was his duty when writing a play, and how should
he fulfil it? Sutro, from the chair, thought Bour-
chier dwelt too much on the need of uplifting the
masses through the agency of good plays. Pinero, just
home from America, considered a writer should give
the best that was in him regardless of popular taste.
Jones, Hichens, Grundy, Barr, Philpotts and Jerome
dealt lightly with the theme. Then my host, the
secretary of the Institute of Journalists, introduced
me as an Australian whose views might be useful to
the Whitefriars. The hour was late and my contri-
bution to the argument had to be as brief as a
flapper’s skirt. It was merely to the effect that the
playwright should look at liis subject through the
box-office window and write only what he thought
would pay. I never got such a “hand” before or
since.
WHEN THE COAST IS CLEAR.
“Do you vamp?”
“Well, sometimes. But not while mother's about.”
“Caesar's Ghost”: “Norbell” says (B.
24/5/’23) that “Hilda Spong did ‘Every-
woman’ for a few shillings.” Our co. was
in M.L. playing, among other things, a piece
called “The Landlord.” In the bar-parlor
of a pub members of the co. were talking about
their triumphs, when one remarked, “We
did ‘The Landlord’ in Wanganui for £95.”
Bung looked up with a start, and imme-
diately set off in chase of the manager.
“Look here,” he said, “you ain’t goin’ to
do no landlord here for nothin’. I w 7 ant cash
in advance.”
“Don Caesar” : Before the “Maritana” con
troversy perishes, let me push in with the
statement that Wallace had nothing to do
with the libretto. That was written, for the
most part, by Edward Fitzball, but the words
of “Scenes That Are Brightest” and “In
Happy Moments” were by a person with
the unpoetic name of Bunn —Alfred Bunn.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : Looking at Nellie Fer-
guson to-day it is hard to believe that she
used to impersonate the ill-nourished Jo in
“Bleak House,” and the attenuated Oliver
Twist. When a girl Nellie was uncommonly
successful in both characters, as her father,
D’Orsay Ogden, had good .reason to know.
Many a frost was thawed by the sentimental
old stuff. Once, when Nellie was Oliver,
Harry Douglas, as Bill Sikes, belted Nancy
with a specially-made cudgel, the head of
which was a split rubber ball containing a
“blood-sponge.” Wherever Douglas walloped
the lady a white mark was left surrounded
by a splather of cochineal-blood. Harry
used to be consumedly proud of the effect
created by this simulated ferocity. “Night
after night,” he would recall in later years,
“wim-men were carried faint-ing from the
theat —ah.”
“Blackfriars”: Gerald du Maurier and
Viola Tree have laid their heads together and
concocted a play called “Dancers,” the
pseudonym “Hubert Parsons” ill-concealing
their dual identity. The show contains cow-
boys and a masquerading earl, who nearly
loses the good girl he meets in the Far West
because he considers it only right to marry
the bad girl, to whom he got engaged in a
sluggish fashion 10 years ago. A marriage
in high life is narrowly averted through a
convenient overdope. Then the right young
woman arrives from the Golden West and
gets her earl, after all. The voice is the
voice of Gerald, but that hand seems to b«
the hand of Viola.
“The Deacon”: Everyone to his taste, by
all means, as “Abbot Park” (B. 14/6/23)
remarks concerning what he regards as
Shakspeare’s most “unpleasant” play. .All
the same, the bright thoughts and intentions
of Caliban towards Miranda in “The Tem-
pest” wouldn’t convey any uplift to the
local Dorcas Society.
“8.C.F.”: When the late Charlie Work-
man was in Johannesburg with a D’Oyley
Carte co., he shared the same dressing-room
with Fred Billington, a burly Yorkshire
basso. At Capetown they had engaged a
man as dresser and general factotum; he
made himself indispensable, and was, they
assured me, “a perfect jewel.” One treasury
night they left their pay envelopes and all
their jewellery on the dressing-table in his
care, being for some minutes on the stage
together. Returning first, Charlie found the
room tenantless; but, thinking Jeames had
been called away and taken the valuables
with him for safe-keeping, he did not worry.
Then Fred came in, and the callboy, sent
to the stage-door to make inquiry, brought
the tidings that the perfect jewel had gone
out 10 minutes earlier, w r alking very fast
and carrying a handbag. Fred broke the
heavy silence. “Well, we won’t have to tip
the blighter, anyhow 7,” he said.
“Pollio”: “In Dahomey” (B. 14/6/’23 )
wasn’t much of a play—one good song and
the rest a curiosity. But the colored com-
pany that performed it knew 7 more about
its value than do
most musical comedy
folk about theirs.
The last act was sup-
posed to begin with a
firefly ballet in a
swamp, and end with
the usual gathering
up of the ragged ends
of the plot; a front
scene of no import-
ance separated these
two. But on the first
night the final scene
fell flat, while the
ba 11 e t—a really
piquant thing—w a s
encored. So on the
second night—l was
there—they simply re-
versed the order of
the scenes, got rid of
the plot by 10.30,
gagged the front scene
through anyhow, and
wound up w 7 ith a viva-
cious rendering of the
ballet. It was en-
cored and re-encored.
And then the audience
sat back to endure
the wind-up, not hav-
ing noticed that they’d
had it. The orchestra had to play “God Save’’
four times before anyone tumbled to the
fact that the play was over.
“Blackfriars” : The London cablemen have
lost all sense of proportion in chronicling
the bi-weekly “triumphs” of Australian
nightingales in that village. Pianist Ernest
Hutcheson seldom gets a line, although he
is probably the greatest Australian instru-
mentalist abroad, and Frances Alda and
Stralia, both miles higher in the song-world
than the girls who have captured the cable
offices, are never mentioned. Hutcheson is
about the only living musician who can still
draw a jazz-saturated multitude to recitals
exclusively devoted in turn to Beethoven,
Bach, Schumann, Chopin and Liszt. “A few
of the moderns,” New York Musical
Courier urges, “might do worse than
attend one of Hutcheson’s recitals and get
the proper point of view 7.” Yet how 7 many of
his fellow-countrymen have ever heard of
him ?
“Orb”: Cabled that the Birmingham Re-
pertory Theatre crowd, the best-known reper-
tory lot in England, celebrated Shakspeare’s
birthday by playing “Cymbeline.” The
Roman soldiers wore the uniform of the
Bersaglieri, and the ancient Britons were
in khaki. The characters in the wager scene
appeared in dinner-jackets, and lachimo
sported modern evening-dress w r hen he got
out of the trunk. No other particulars are
furnished, but 1 suppose these, young Roman
knuts displayed hot socks and drank whisky-
and-soda. Imogen, of course, retired for the
night in pyjamas of kingfisher marocain after
climbing out of a smart georgette evening
frock and Mauvaise-honte corsets. In tkt-
Brummagem version of “Cymbeline” these
lines were doubtless cut:—
“Thou villain base,
Know’st me not by my clothes?’’
“No, ror thy tailor, rascal.
Who is thy grandfather : he made those clothes,
Which, as it seems, make thee.’’
When Nance O’Neil did “Macbeth” here the
difficulty of dressing the supers correctly as
“kerns and gallow’glasses” w 7 as overcome by
sending them pretty w'ell mother-naked to
the paint-frame, where the scenic artist ap-
Elied local color w’ith a 6in. brush. Some-
ow r , that sounds a more effective way of
doing it than putting them into khaki.
COY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Miss Sylvia’s voice is in flrmarrl
Wherever she may chance to I e:
Her critics say she heats ihc band
In “Requiem” or “My Rosary.”
But, still she’s coy as anything:
It takes some words caressing
To win her to the mood to sing—
She takes a lot of pressing.
More than Miss Sylvia’s voice I like ;
A subtle charm to her belongs—
It often gives mj r heart the spike
That she should waste my time with songs ;
And deep I cursed the “Ah, now do’s,”
The “But you must” and “Yes”-ing
With which her usual audience woos —
She takes no end of pressing.
To me as coyly did she show
When, whispering, I spoke to her.
Time after time she answered “No,”
Yot from her side I would not stir.
At length into the garden we
Went softly, rules transgressing. . . .
I found, with no one near to see,
She still took lots of pressing.

“BILLABONG”
Windmills and Troughing
offer you a full measure of Service,
Dependability and Value,
Their outstanding quality and many exclusive features
make BILLABONG” Pumping and Water-supply Plants
the preferred choice of all who demand the utmost of the
above qualities.
Referring to “BILLABONG” Windmills, an enthusi-
astic owner writes as follows:
“When in need of a Mill, I obtained catalogs of every
make of Mill known to me. These I submitted to two of
my brothers (who are expert mechanics, and one especially
skilled in machine design and construction), asking them to
pick out a Mill. They had not the slightest hesitation in
arriving at the conclusion that the absolute superiority of
the ‘BILLABONG' over all other makes was evidenced by
even the most casual perusal of the catalogs. I consider the
‘BILLABONG' can give points to every other make of Mill
from top to bottom.”
“BILLABONG” Patent Steel Troughing is equally superior in
Its class. It is constructed on commonsense lines that enable it to
withstand rough usage and hard bumps. Its patent interlocking,
grooved joints are easily fitted together, cannot pull apart, and cannot
leak. “BILLABONG” Troughing is supported in a framework of
heavy angle steel, and will give so many “years of extra service” that 4
it is easily the cheapest troughing proposition available. M
There is much that we would like to tell you about fm
“BILLABONG” Mills and Troughing. but as the space available
here will not do them justice, we will gladly send you our illus- Jm
trated booklet, “W. 65,” which tells the whole story. Write NOW xff
for your copy. P

J. Northcote: No, you won’t drag that
sectarian tail-of-my-coat through these pages....
Saaedi: “Casual Bloke” too much like too many
things. But you might make something out of the
Maaleesh parallel... .S.T.D.: Too vague for us. We
loathe cloudy generalities.... Deco: No doubt there
is plenty to be said in favor of birth control —in
individual cases. . . .P.R.P.; We read your poem for-
wards, and we read it backwards; but it didn’t
seem to mean anything either way.... Poss: We’ve
known men who could make as good verse by putting
the dictionary through the domestic sausage-machine.
.. . .M.R.K.: Commonplace, except where you make
an heroic attempt to rhyme “Noah” with “four.”
....C.: Thanks, the error was noted.... Grizzly:
Your Pegasus is too prone to trip over his own
feet... .N.L.P.: No, there are other discrepancies.
This one attracted attention most, however, because
it was so large, in proportion, and arrived so sud-
denly—almost in a day, like Jonah’s gourd... .
B.S. (Tas.) : The tragic beauty of the tale moves us:
A trainer had a noble steed.
The finest in the land;
But he for -funds was not in need.
So he was kept in hand.
* ‘We’ll keep him for the Melbourne Cup*
And fill him up with dope,
, He’ll show the other goats all up,
f For they will have no hope.
“No hope with him. when he’s not green,"
The trainer boast did make,
But there is many a slip between
The Cup, the lip, the stake.
One morn while training on the track,
With an apprentice up,
He stumbled over, broke his back;
That’s how they lost the cup.
•. • .Oedyshros: Too obviously manufactured....
D.R.F.: It doesn’t make much of a yarn.... El
Dorado: Not enough point... .J.C.E.: Shocking....
W.H. (Brisbane): Doesn’t strike us... .S.M.R.: No
good to us.., .Raupo: Lost itself on the track....
Pat B.: Verse too weak to hobble in.... J.D.M.:
Old idea in poor verse Black Sand: “The Dredge”
will bring up no g01d... .G. 8.: The old wail with
the same “murky lea” and “deep’ning g100m”...,
Koinahin: Why leave out all the definite articles?
You are not writing a telegram... .H.J.C.: Improve
your workmanship R.A.8.: Verse asking God to
look after the world when it is dusk is no doubt
meant kindly; but it lacks distinction... . ( J.H.
(North Brighton) : You must do better than that....
ICat: That’s the way to do it: —
I am going to be a cooky’s handy man.
And learn the noble art of milking Polly and her
clan;
I’ll take great pride in rearing every poddy calf,
With courtesy I’ll always separate the pig and chaff ;
When I’ve mastered the intricacies of reaping and
sowipg,
To the cocky for my cheque I’ll be going.
And every day slowly I’ll improve my position
In spite of the callous, long tongue, brainless poli-
tician.
... .E.M.W.T.: Can’t do anything with it....
A. : Nothing wrong except that the matter wears
white whiskers... .Ynot: Vivid enough, but the idea
has got sore shoulders through overwork.... Midas:
The “Ring” doesn’t fit....H.M. (Unley Park): As
empty as a pre-election promise... .A.H.G.: Far too
rough..: .M.C.S.-: Poor stuff submitted in handwrit-
ing that an inebriated hornet might envy....
W.F.11.: Thin and made of w00d.... Osesar: Doesn’t
get half-way across the Alps... .C.W.P.: “Winter”
won’t do. The others have a chance. Put your
name on your copy.... Curlew: An ancient story
told tediously,.. .D.F.S.: Same old thing, same old
way....M.8. (Gore Hill): Commonplaces in shamb-
ling verse... .D.S.R.: No use to us. .. .E.G.H.: Stop
thee-ing and thou-ing and try to make your verse
look sincere... .M.P. (Mudgee): Poor stuff....
E.J.T.: It wobbles and it bumps and says the obvi-
ous thing weakly. .. .A.B. (Elsternwick) : Not bad,
but this is a poor market for that sort of thing... .
J.A.R.: Not well enough done. .. .Plodder: “"Why”
is too slight. The other has yet to be dealt with.
. ...E.G.1).: “Girl” is a squeezable object; but you
simply can’t make her fit in to rhyme with “world.”
. ...J.H.S.: The sonnets move harshly.... The Knut:

worse. .. .J.R. (Dunedin): No, thanks... .J.H.D.:
It toils too heavily.... P.H. A. : You string it out
with useless words. .. .C.M. (Lismore) : Try again.

but you might improve it.... Mary W.: None of
them up....H.L. (Belltrees) : (1) Get something
to say ; (2) Practise the art of saying it. . . .John A.:
No use to u5.,.,5.1.D.: Shortweight as to interest...
H.F. (Glenelg) : The verse is better than the prose ;
if it were a little better it would be acceptable....
D. : Both score a miss. .. .M.R.K.: Too weak to
carry its weight. .. .R.S.J.: Nothing in the murder of
the goat. .. . A.C.T.: No earthly use.... Lone Hand:
Not strong enough to take a trick... .H.G.M.: That
sort of verse isn’t suitable for yarn-telling....’
M.H.M.: Well done; but that professor wasn’t
pleading for a classical education. ... Grip: There
is no music in it... . Yardley: You haven’t grasped
the idea. Of course, we have put the same quantity
of gold into a sovereign; but if you were able to
take the sovereign abroad you would find that it
was worth anything from 10 p.c. to 20,000 times
more than it used to be in other countries’ cur-
rency. It is this premium which has kept most
Australian gold-mining cos. going during the past
five years.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)

“Monaro”: Surely this is the oddest acci-
dent ever. Recently a M.L. telegraph-
operator, immediately on blowing his nose,
felt a stinging sensation in his left eye.
Examination showed that the force of the
blow had burst the eyeball, totally destroy-
ing the sight. In future when that operator
has a cold he’s going to wear a bib.

THE amazing redudion in
the price of Palmolive has
no parallel in Australia so
far as a high quality toilet soap is
concerned. And we again em-
phasize that there is no change in
Quality, Size, Weight or Shape.
The fragrant cake of Palmolive
which costs IV2 d. to-day is of the
same remarkable quality as the
Palmolive which hitherto cost 1/-.
Think what this means. No
longer is the green and fragrant
cake of Palmolive reserved for
mother, father and grown-up
daughters. The children now
may revel in its use from bath to
bedtime. From earliest infancy,
through nursery and school days,
the skin need never know the dis-
comfort of pimples, blackheads
and roughness resulting from im-
peded cleansing. For all cleans-
ing that does not get beneath the
skin, penetrate the pores and free
them from all accumulations, is
impeded.
Palmolive is the perfed cleanser.
It contains the valuable oils of the
palm and the olive. These oils
are lotion-like and soothing, and
at the same time penetrative in
their adion. They do get beneath
the skin; they do enter the
minutest pores and cleanse and
free them from all impurities.
Palmolive is the modern develop-
ment of an ancient beauty secret
known to the Egyptians at least
3,000 years ago. The elegant
women of that wonderful civiliza-
tion used the crude blend of the
oils of the palm and the olive to
cleanse and beautify their skins;
to keep them smooth and soft.
And modern scientific research,
employing the best brains, a vast
amount of money and many years
of time, has discovered nothing
better, nothing to compare with
this age-old beauty secret.
Palmolive permits thorough, beau-
tifying cleansing. It soothes and
refreshes ; it stimulates the skin to
healthy adion resulting in smooth,
fine texture and clear, natural
bloom. Buy Palmolive for your
personal use, and buy it for the
bathroom. You cannot buy a finer
soap no matter what price you pay.

“Umses” : Defendant in a by-law case in
Christchurch (M.L.) the other day stated
that he had been driving a traction-engine
for 73 years. He is now 88. Can anyone
top that record for sticking to one job?
“Biloela” : For big yields off small areas
tomatoes are worth mentioning. At Agnes
Banks (Hawkesbury River) two seasons ago
a man harvested 924 half-bushel cases from
a quarter-acre. The average value was ss. 6d.
—£254. This was a single-handed perform-
ance and the net return was £202.
* * * *
“Dash Dotty” : The latest machine of the
Telegraph Department is the Diplex, which
enables messages to be sent two ways simul-
taneously on the one wire. It is a variation
of the Duplex, and has thus far been used
only on short circuits, but lately has worked
well up to 150 miles. In fact, a private
trial between Sydney and Melbourne, con-
ducted at midnight, proved that at a pinch
it could be used over that stretch.
* * * *
“Sammas”: There are some outrageous
anomalies in the tariff. Diamond jewellery is
subject to a duty which causes hardship to
nobody and helps to pay legislators’ salaries.
But unset diamonds are allowed in duty-free.
Most assuredly diamonds in any form should
be dutiable, as they not only represent the
highest and most inane form of luxury, but
cannot even boast the usefulness generally
ascribed to motor-cars or fur-coats.
* * * *
“Geo Rich” : Westralia can boast of own-
ing a few big things besides the State deficit.
At Katanning a mushroom slightly over 74in.
in circumference, and weighing l|lb., was
recently exhibited. At the Porongorups, pota-
toes, grown without manure, were dug that
scaled 3flb. each. And last season Kendenup
(the De Garis settlement) grew a water-
melon that scaled 72Jlb. Kendenup also has
the first commercial dehydrator south of the
line.
* # * *
“Cutter”: There is a grocer’s boy in Tara-
naki (M.L.) who is going to be heard of in
the future. The boss held a local butcher’s
cheque that had been dishonored two or three
times. The new boy was directed to make
an appeal to the drawer to supply currency
in its stead. He waited until Saturday night,
bought a roast of beef, and' tendered the
cheque in payment. An assistant duly
counted out the change. The butcher went
bung on the Monday.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: The N. S. Wales Bung is
getting some unpleasant shocks over the
new method of estimating the value of
licenses. Under the old system the annual
fee was an assessed round figure—practically
a guess at the fair thing ; by the 1922 Liquor
Act Amendment 2 p.c. of the liquor pur-
chases for the previous year becomes the
amount to be paid for the license. A wine-
shop-keeper in a comparatively small way
found his annual fee raised from £2O to over
£6l; and a suburban hotel, which last year
paid £B5, is now expected to disgorge £333
16s. 9d. The out-at-elbows State Govern-
ment will have quite a heap of unexpected
money rustling into the cashbox. But it
will manage to get rid of it somehow.
* * * «
“The Deacon”: I noted a new and ingeni-
ous way of obtaining a free ride in Sydney
the other day. The two oracle-workers, be-
ing apparently anxious to get to the top of
Oxford-street with the least possible exer-
tion, waited till the motor-’bus was well
filled and the conductor safe in the crowded
front portion. It was close by the Padding-
town Town Hall before he reached them, and
they immediately began an earnest conver-
sation on their fingers. The ticket-snatcher
indicated no compree, whereat one of the
non-paying passengers produced pencil and
pad and wrote that they were strangers in
the city and wanted to be put down at the
Deaf and Dumb Institution. The sympa-
thetic conductor laboriously wrote his grief
that they were on the wrong mr -hine, and,
whilst the show waited, put the necessary
directions down. I got off there, too, and
heard them congratulating one another over
the entire success of the dodge.
THE END OF THE MARK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The mark, whose old value was 20 to the £, is
now quoted at 350,000.”
He was a German millionaire
And sadly did he go ;
His head beneath his cash and care
Was bending very low.
The mark-notes bundled on his back
Were there for all to see;
Yet he was starving for the lack
Of breakfast, lunch and tea.
Alas, that wealth should be so poor 1
He leaned against a wall
And listened to make very sure
How far the mark could fall.
Yes, plain enough he heard the crash
That rang through all the town —
A rustling thud that told of cash
Still bumping, bumping down.
But yesterday his million stood
Strong for the day’s defence;
The notes at any time he could
Exchange for eighteen pence.
But now, with hunger much enlarged,
He felt the game was done;
The cheapest eating-houses charged
Five millions for a bun.
And so he swore at the police
Until they ran him in
To eat black bread and be at peace
With other men of sin.
And still the mark went down and down
And unbought buns grew stale,
Till all the millionaires in town
Were very safe in gaol.
Then, with the beat of marching drums,
The allied hosts drew near,
As eager as the throng that comes
At five o’clock for beer.
Yet at their coming all was peace;
The town seemed at its prayers.
They only found the sad police
Who kept the millionaires.

“Tarago”: We were up for pension exam-
ination. The M.O. shook his head sadly at
Blue. “You’ve got a very dirty tongue,
young man,” he said. “Dirty tongue!” ex-
claimed Blue. “Strike me, doctor, you orter
’eard our section corporal.”
“L.D.1.”: Another lively argument to
confound Barwell and the Black Northers
is John Hewitt, native of North of Ireland,
who came to Tambo (Q.) in 1564, built
Greendale woolshed, and has been carpen-
tering here ever since. He passed his 90th
milestone on May 1, and is still able to .look
after his garden and fruit-trees.
Just-knighted William Thorley Loton, of
Perth, is the only one alive of the Western
Staters who attended the Federation Con-
ference presided over by Parkes at Sydney
in IS9I. Other survivors of the 43 dele-
gates present at that convention are
McMillan (N.S.W.), Thynne (Q-), Cockburn
and Justice Gordon (S.A.), and Bird
(Speck). Loton, born in 1839, is the oldest
of the living six.
“Harold Hardupp”: Melbourne, like Syd-
ney, is afflicted with an excess of doctors.
All told, there are 1060 in Victoria, 647 ol
them in the big city. The Uni. exams, have
added 416 brand-new practitioners to the
over-crowded profession in six years, the last
batch numbering 67. In Sydney recently
an institution which advertised a medical
appointment at £3OO per annum had 370
applications to consider.
Magnificent McCall, Clerk of the Vic.
Uppah Chambah, is likely to see next session
through before giving up his post. He under-
stands the Dreary House better than the
whiskery Jenkins ever did, and, having iew,
if any, prejudices, gives much quiet help to
expedite business. McCall had to wait for
promotion from Usher of the Black Rod as
long as Jacob had- to serve to win Rachel,
both Jenkins and Pitts being stickers; so he
isn’t inclined to hurry about quitting his job.
P. Verschaffelt, the new M.L. Public
Service Commissioner, is a brainy person
with a fine record. He began as a cadet in
the Lands and Survey Department at Gis-
borne only 17 years ago. In 1915 he was
appointed sec. to the Commissioners, in 1919
became Controller of Wills in the Public-
Trust Office, and recently has been Acting-
Commissioner. Verschaffelt graduated LL.B.
at Wellington, is a barrister and solicitor,
and holds the rarest of accountancy diplo-
mas.
In days when fiction was cut to a pattern
now nearly obsolete, there was a sliding
panel in a wall of the haunted grange to let
the ghost through. Now it is in the haunted
ballot-box, and lets the ghostly voter through.
If there is truth in half of what is said
about stolen ballot-papers, and surrepti-
tiously-printed ballot-papers, and about trick-
boxes to put sham votes in, and tricky holes
through which to take real votes out, the
fight for a N. S. Wales Labor selection or
for a small union appointment is as fierce
as any old-time struggle for the job of Caesar,
and not so respectable.
“J.E.D.” (S’Africa) : So Oswald Howse
has passed on (B. 22/3/’23). I was
examined by him in ’96 when he was prac-
tising at Wingham (N.S.W.). Reginald
Neville was then at Taree, and left to prac-
tise at Orange. I saw Neville during the
Boer War with the N. S. Wales Ambulance
Corps. They were both personalities to re-
member in the old days, even though their
English style of riding togs did amuse the
locals. With the advent of the motor-car
doctoring must be an easy job now compared
with what the old medicoes went through. I
once knew Oswald Howse to ride 60 miles,
without a stop, except to change horses, to
a bad case of smashed leg. Part of the ride
was over a mountain track, and the time was
about 54 hours.
“FY7” : “Pat Busliie” hits the mark (B.
31/5/’23) in his comment on the leniency of
country juries. Up to a few years ago it
was impossible to get a jury to convict for
cattle- or horse-stealing at such places as
Roma or St. George, in South-West Queens-
land. A Roma jury made itself so famous
by its amazing acquittal of the defendants
in the great overlanding steal from Bowen
Downs to Adelaide that the Government
withdrew the town from the District Courts
list for many years. Rolf Boldrewood has
made that story familiar in “Robbery Under
Arms,” though in the book the cattle-lifters
are convicted. In the Far North matters
are still so bad that the Cloncurry cattlemen
have banded themselves together to preserve
the rights which the law, as now admin-
istered, is powerless to maintain.
“Rooinek”: Australian newspapers have
recently been claiming that the Hollinger
(Canada) is the world’s greatest gold-pro-
ducer. The two biggest Rand mines, Gov-
ernment Gold-mining Areas and Crown
Mines, are both ahead of it. The Canadian
show was credited with lan output of
£2,400,000 last year. Owing to the strike
the Rand worked only nine months for the
following results for three mines
Gold
, Treated. Produced.
Govt. Gold Areas . . 1,241,500 tons £2,495,989
Crown Mines . . 1,778,000 „ 2,458,002
New Moddersfontein 929,000 „ 1,945)676
Within the next few years there may be a
new claimant for the title: New State Areas,
which has an immense holding on the richest
portion of the East Rand, commences pro-
duction on a large scale next month.
“Burwood”: I ran across old Harry Bald-
win the other day. He lives in the shadow
of the Dandenong Ranges, beyond Croydon
(Vic.), and had just got back from his first
visit to Melbourne for 15 years. He was
ropeable—didn’t know what things were
coming to; mustn’t stand here, mustn’t
stop there, couldn’t even walk across the
street except from corner to corner. “Tell-
ing me where to go and what to do,” he
rumbled; “me that carted logs for the old
Princes Bridge before this one was thought
of! Wonder what they’d say if I took a
bullock-team along Flinders-street now!”
Harry says the only time he ever got bushed
was when looking for bullocks with his father

“E very blessed
day of my life I
use Rexona Shav-
ing Soap, and not
for worlds would I
use any other.”
—Mr. PHIL SMITH.
m
“I enjoy shaving: with
Rexona Shaving: Soap, and
have found it to exactly
suit me. It lathers freely
and makes shaving: a de-
light.”
—Mr. NORMAN LEE.
Men! Try a Rexona
Shave
You’ll Enjoy It.
In half-a-minute Rexona Shaving Soap softens
the beard, and the lather will remain on the face
with all its softness for twelve minutes ; but Rexona
shavers do not require this, for Rexona Shaving
Soap makes the beard so soft that a Rexona shave
really takes not more than two minutes.
A Rexona shave is a luxuriant yet an economical
shave, for the lather is over 150 times as great as
the Soap used, and a 1/0 triangular stick is suffici-
ent to last the average man at least 150 shaves,
which makes over eight shaves for a penny. Then,
too, consider how much easier Rexona Shaving
Soap makes the beard on the razor, and how soft,
smooth and antiseptic it leaves the skin, and pro-
tects it from all weather conditions.
Being an antiseptic medicated Soap, it has a
tendency to quickly heal any cut you may have the
misfortune to get, and if troubled with pimples or
blotches of any kind, will daily tend to improve
them.
Men! Try Rexona Shaving Soap, the new trian-
gular stick—-we can promise you a new satisfaction.
“As a luxury, as a necessity
and as a unique novelty I
give the palm to Rexona
Shaving Soap.”

The Long Voyage.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
barque goes reeling down the seas
Before the culling wind,
And all the lees of longshore ease
Once more are left behind ;
Left seething leagues behind,
And wide-eyed lifts the day,
Aflame, from caves of crystal waves
Full half the world away.
The rigging sings like smitten strings;
She sways to dip and lift;
Thick o’er her sides as deep she rides
The hissing fleeces drift;
The shorn foam-fleeces drift,
And veiled the sun sinks dim,
liedd’ning the verge of some great surge
Far on creation’s rim.
The throbbing sea makes melody
Beneath her shearing keel;
Sullen or bright comes day, comes night
Swift as a circling wheel;
An ever-turning wheel
That at the last swings high
The shadowy strand of some strange land
Between the sea and sky.

The Valley.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A CHILD of the wide spaces was Rex
Campbell, sombre and silent, yet
at times rippled by vivacity, as a
silent lagoon may be ruffled by fitful gusts.
By lonely ridge and across the great plains we
bad ridden together, scalping, droving,
tramping; we had battled through it all,
vagabonds of the great Outback.
And through it all ran the throb of un-
rest, of vague longings, and the thread of
nameless dreams; for Campbell was a vision-
ary. The heart of the camp-fire glowing
redly, the lament of the curlew from dark
slopes of forest, the moonlight silvering the
ti-tree flats, these played on the strings of
his soul, awakening strange emotions that
found expression in rapt utterance, until
I, too, fell under the sway of his inspira-
tion. Amidst the vagaries of a complex
character, strangest of all was his aversion
to goannas. Wrapped in our blankets in
the black silence of the night I learnt to
distinguish the peculiar slithering rustle of
these reptiles, like the swish of a piece of
carpet across a floor, at which Campbell
would squirm with loathing. “Why this
hymn of hate, O Pal?” I flippantly asked
on one occasion. “Don’t know,” he snapped
savagely; “I hate the wriggling brutes, that’s
On another occasion, while asprawl after
our midday meal, he suddenly quickened at
sight of a large-size goanna foraging round
our camp for scraps.
“Look at the filthy brute,” he burst out,
his face quivering with a strange mixture
of shrinking and ferocity. “Look at it side-
ling and slithering like something unclean,
always on the prowl.” I stared in amaze.
I had seen my emotional cobber in many
phases, but this time he had blazed into
quick, fierce hatred. “Ghouls of the wilds,
scavengers of the forest,” he carried on pas-
sionately—“look at it, repulsive and bloated
with obscene feasts! See its snaky head,
with the cruel jaws that tear and rend at
anything weak and maimed. Heaven help
the stricken swaggie in the goanna dis-
tricts ! Damn you!”—he snapped off to
rush the reptile, pelting it with rocks in a
spasm of fury.
Still marvelling I commented on his
strange obsession, and Campbell, whose fury
had left him with the sudden shift of his
mercurial temperament, looked at me with
the eyes of a mystic.
“How can I explain?” he asked dreamily.
“At sight of them I have always felt sort
of cold and shuddery, a mixture of loathing
and fear. Is it some hereditary horror, and
the experience of a past existence still in
my soul? Is it simply a random prejudice
or a presentiment of evil from these reptiles?
Who knows? Some day I intend writing
to the Psychic Research people about it.
Now look lively and let’s get on the road.”
After some months’ separation we had
joined forces in Taroom, for the ’possum
season was at hand, and the surrounding
district bore promise of being rich in fur
skins.
Who that has battled over the wide spaces
of this continent can boast of his experi-
ence until he has known Taroom, of Central-
West Queensland? One of the oldest settle-
ments in the northern State, it sprawls
drowsily in the heart of the forest country.
Only at the end of the ’possum season, when
hundreds of fur-hunters assemble with their
loads of skins, drawing. in by twos and
threes from the vast wilderness of the bush-
lands, does the town yawn and rouse itself
from slumber. Cosmopolitan are these
gatherings of men, for the lure of the ’pos-
sum season, with its tales of big cheques
made in rich fur-bearing districts, appeals
to many. The cultured gentleman on his
uppers, the knock-about battling through at
whatever turns up, crooks and nondescripts
from cities, drifting flotsam of humanity, all
mingle with the professional hunters in a
hotch-potch.
Taroom sees them assembling, unkempt,
browned, bearded, eager for the feel of a
cheque and the flavor of the fleshpots. The
atmosphere of the town grows heavy with
the musty smell of pelts as the buying agents
pile and classify. For a short space the
town itself throbs with the rip and tear of
a jamboree. Sprawling forms litter the by-
ways. Gusty oaths and the thud of blows
in grunting," clawing conflict mingle with
the crash of bottles and the drunken clamor
of attempted melody, as cheques are broken
down. Then they drift off, and Taroom
sinks back into its day-dream.
Again at Show-time does the township
flutter with a week’s gaiety. From the four
points they gather, grave-faced bushmen and
bright-eyed girls. From far-flung station
and settlement they beat in till the town
rocks with the thunder of hoofs and the
rumble of motor-cars, and the listening
silence of night is threaded and pulsed with
the beat and swing of dance-tunes and the
lilt of laughter. Yet again the phase passes
and the town is enfolded, overshadowed by
a great loneliness.
The forest districts stretching away north
and west of Taroom have been left un-
touched by the swing of Ages. The spirit
of Creation’s dawn still breathes in the
sombre depths of timbered valleys and
rugged ridges, till the mind of the traveller,
sensing its mystic spell, grows hushed and
listening in strange expectancy. It w r as here
the curtain of oblivion enveloped Leich-
hardt, the explorer, and his party. A hoary,
weather-beaten coolabah in the main street
bears his initial chopped in the trunk. Just
a last little token of his progress before
being engulfed in the mists of the unknown,
and the story ends. Grim, dark and inscrut-
able, the Spirit of the Wilds holds the secret
well.
We struck out from Taroom in a clatter-
ing four-wheeled contrivance packed with
our outfit and drawn by a pair of veteran
nags. The tang of the bush, pungent and
fragrant, mounted like an incense, while the
feel of space, of freedom, the thrill of Nature
in all her wild splendor, warmed in our veins
like a draught of wine. And Campbell, pul-
sing with the spirit of it all, sang as we
threaded our way across the low-lying
stretches of the Dawson Valley, and swung
to the north-west, winding upwards towards
the higher levels of the plateau. Along
Palm Tree Creek, past Wombagwine and
Coorada cattle stations our track led, a clear
70 miles from Taroom, for Campbell was
heading for The Gorge bordering on Coorada.
Giant trees towered and sprawled far above
our heads. Yellow Jack, coolabah, silver-
leaved ironbark, interwoven in a medley of
mighty forest foliage, eternal, colossal and
engraved with the tale of Ages, ran on into
hazy distance. Past lagoons, gleaming in
sheltered valleys, where wild-fowl splashed
and rioted among gorgeous water blooms,
secure from the intrusion of man; over
ridges whose crests rose from the maze of
timber to peer across intervening space, we
plodded leisurely onwards, while the harsh
clamor of cockatoos in the tree-tops split
the heavy silence. At times a kangaroo
threshed across an open slope, or a stray
dingo slunk between the tree-trunks.
At night pur camp-fire gleamed redly
through a world of darkness, while strange
murmurings hushed the mind. For the spirit
of the primeval seemed to creep through the
forest, whispering its message. At these
times the mood of Campbell flickered in
strange phases, seeming to shrink in the
grip of an unknown dread. Then out of the
night would steal the hateful, slithering
rustle, awakening in him vibrant profanity.
Finally, threading the timbered mazes of
outlying Coorada, we reached The Gorge and
looked down on a panorama, immense, won-
derful, numbing the mind with the sublime
majesty of Nature. New to the scene, I
gazed speechless. Slumping on a rock, Camp-
bell, who had run across the place in some
previous bush wanderings, regarded my
absorption with dreamy understanding.
“Overwhelming, eh?” he murmured. “A
freakish immensity of Nature that staggers
the feeble human mind. Yet Man in his
swaggering arrogance climbs on a self-built
pedestal and crows his lordship in the plan
of Creation.” His voice crooned on in lazy
sarcasm. “Crows like a barnyard rooster,
and with about as much intelligence! Man
the Supreme, for whose whimsical conveni-
ence the very planets whirl in their courses!
Then we look unon this” —he flung his hand
towards the valley and sank into silence.
A convulsion of Nature, an irruption
occurring in the dim past when the Earth
rocked and shivered in the throes of fearful
travail, when the pitch-black of the heavens
was lit by the glare of volcanic outbursts —
such was The Gorge. In an extremity of
agony the Earth had gaped and stiffened,
leaving a fissure whose bottom lay several
hundred feet down precipitous cliffs, and
whose sides opened into a valley that
stretched away to the skyline. Accessible
only at one point, this was the country
Campbell was aiming for with eagerness,
partly because of the untouched possibilities
of its skins and partly because of the spirit
of exploration.
The lengthening shadows awakened us to
action and camp was made close handy. We
were quick to the blankets, and soon the
dying embers of the camp-fire winked dully
through the darkness, while the clink of the
hobbled horses died in our consciousness.
The hilarity of the kookaburras found us
on the move in the early dawn. Leaving
the waggon, with a few accessories strapped
across our saddles, we rode along the lip
of The Gorge for some miles, seeking the
point of access into the valley. The elation
of adventure stirred warmly in us, and
Campbell in the lead spurred his mount into
a lumbering trot, brushing through over-
hanging foliage that drenched us with
sweet-scented dew. Light and clear he lifted
his tenor voice in the lilting refrain of “The
Yeoman’s Wedding Song,” joining in pealing
notes with the early-morning chorus
of the Bush. “Ding dong, ding dong,
we’l*l gallop along”—often had I heard
him give tongue to that rousing melody,
but only when his pulse was beat-
ing high. When our troopship pulled
out of Pinkenba in the memorable
days of 1914 that song rose among the
tumultuous cheering and the crashing
bands. On various sectors of the French
front it had lost itself in the racket of a
massed attack.
The sun was mounting high when we
reached a bridle-track dipping steeply into
the valley. Leading the veteran nags that
sat back on their haunches with snorting
protest, we slithered and scrambled down the
path. As we descended, the noises of the
upland forest died and we plunged into a
silence that struck sharply on the senses.
The forest growth hung limp, and no wild
life woke the echoes. The aisles stretched
gloomy and silent, till one lowered the voice,
and the ear was strained in listening.
Campbell was ahead, picking his way
down the slope, winding in and out between
giant boulders. Suddenly he paused,
peering at a rock jutting out from
the steep-cut wall. The face of it was
smooth and worn, and roughly chipped across
its surface was the picture of a sprawling
reptile. The crude drawing had been colored
with some dark stain which yet remained

"THE surest way of keeping the skin flexible, healthy and
1 free of all disfigurement is to instantly check the least
sign of roughness, soreness or scaliness with Zam-Buk.
This powerful herbal balm soothes, purifies and heals in
a marvellous way.
When you treat your skin with Zarn-
Buk, you may be sure that you are not
experimenting with any common oint-
ment or salve containing animal fats
and mineral poisons—but giving your
skin the benefit of the most curative
essences which Mother Nature provides.
While so naturally healing, Zam-
Buk also has a powerful germicidal and
soothing influence. It quickly allays all
itching irritation, causes inflammation
and swelling to subside, and grows
healthy, new skin in a unique way.
Whether your trouble be ordinary
pimply eruptions, sore chapped hands,
chilblains or a more serious attack of
eczema, ulcers, abscesses,
ringworm or blood poison,
you can always depend upon Zam-
Buk. Zam-Buk’s powerful antiseptic
and skin-growing properties make it a
perfect healer for cuts, burns, scalds,
etc. It is also the soothing remedy for
piles, and used as an embrocation soon
drives away muscular rheumatism, stiff-
ness and other aches and pains.
Mr. JOHN PROWSE. Magpie Street,
Ballarat East, Victoria, says:—“l was troubled
with skin sores oil my face for about six months,
and nothing that I tried offered any relief. At
last I applied for a sample of Zam-Buk, as
offered by you in our local paper, and I am
glad to say that after using Zam-Buk for about
a week the sores completely disappeared.
“I can very gratefully testify to the healing
power of your wonderful remedy, and shall
always recommend it to anyone suffering from
skin troubles.”
A box of Zam-Buk kept always
handy saves hours of pain and many a
doctor’s bill. Don’t be persuaded to
waste time and money on useless sub-
stitutes.

fairly fresh, showing up vividly the repre-
sentation of a huge goanna.
“What the” my exclamation ended in
helpless astonishment.
“More of ’em, there and there,” said
Campbell, pointing.
At many points where the smooth sides of
jutting rocks formed a convenient canvas
for the primitive artist, crude, dark-painted
drawings showed the reptiles squirming in
varied fantastic postures. Many of the
drawings were almost obliterated, apparently
by the wear of ages.
“Must be aborigine art,” I hazarded, as
we approached in closer inspection.
Campbell nodded thoughtfully. “Queer,”
he muttered, sinking into silent contempla-
tion. Presently he roused. “Is there any
record of our niggers doing the sacred stunt
with these brutes?” he queried slowly.
“Don’t be foolish,”, I laughed lightly
“Sacred stunts don’t fit the Aussie black!
Still, it’s funny to find goanna photographs
scattered round on rocks —especially in this
gorge,” I added lamely.
Campbell’s gaze royed round the valley;
then he eyed me in vague abstraction. “Oh,
I don’t know,” he murmured, half to himself.
“I wonder”——- Suddenly lie burst into peev-
ish irritability. “Curse it! Can’t we ever
get away from the jdamned things? Come
on!” He mounted abruptly and rode off,
while I climbed slowly to the saddle and fol-
lowed.
Our course led down the valley, winding
through a maze of forest, with intervals of
tangled scrub. We rode slowly, on the alert
for signs of ’possum, and studying the local-
ity for future operations. Away on the up-
lands the wind tossing Tie forest drifted to
the ear like a faint sighing, but around us
the silence hung heavy, oppressive.
“Darned noisy, this place,’’ grunted Camp-
bell, satirically; “seems like a hoodoo in
the air.”
As we rode into a small clearing, a flurry
of dead leaves ahead showed a big goanna
moving sluggishly for cover. In a few
seconds it was scrambling up a tall iron-
bark on the fringe of the clearing. As it
mounted into the out-flung branches Camp-
bell jerked up the rifle slung across his
saddle. The report billowed through the
valley, and the reptile curled through the
aii’, thudding to the ground.
Something suddenly materialised, crouching
over the dead goanna—something like a little
old man palsied with age that yammered as
though in furious grief. We did not see it
come; it suddenly was there. Black-skinned
it seemed, bent and shrivelled, with wispy,
straggled hair and long, skinny arms that
groped and beat its breast.
“Great Scot!” I broke the spell in an
attempt at flippancy. “What’s this —the old-
est inhabitant?”
As I spoke the Thing flung its arms to-
wards us, uttering a wail that shrilled
through the forest, bitter, despairing, menac-
ing. The cry thrilled me with a sickening
fear. A sort of desperation threw me from
my horse to rush .forward with a vague
thought of grappling with the infernal crea-
ture. Even as I rushed it vanished, though
I saw no sign of fluttering bushes. With
it had vanished also the dead goanna.
Wiping a clammy face I turned to Camp-
bell, who sat immovable.
“Well, what do you make of it?”
Again from the depths of bush rose the
wail. As though in answer, it seemed to
my overwrought consciousness a queer rust-
ling pervaded the forest, like countless creep-
ing things on the move. Campbell was look-
ing at me, grave and anxious.
“An ancient relic of a vanished tribe, or” —
he hesitated—“what is that saying about
things in heaven and earth not dreamt of in
our philosophy?”
The horses had been twitching and stamp-
ing uneasily, and as we sprang to them they
moved off eagerly.
We were far down the valley towards the
close of day, and, striking a clearing beside
a waterhole, we made camp. Grass was
plentiful and the horses were picketed on
ropes. The shadow of the enveloping forest
intensified the gloom, and our camp-fire
seemed a tiny splash of Tight in the ocean of
blackness. While lying on our blankets be-
fore turning in, the dancing flames flickering
on some object lying between us and the fire
drew our attention. Campbell bent forward
to examine it, then looked across at me. The
dead goanna lay before us!
“Where in thunder did that come from?”
I jerked out.
Campbell sat back on his blankets. “Lis-
ten,” he spoke softly. Drifting through the
black silence came a faint, continuous rust-
ling.
“This place seems to be giving us the
dingbats,” I growled. “Let’s sleep it off.”
And we curled up in the blankets.
I must have slept, for suddenly something
stabbed through my senses, bringing me wide
awake. It came again, a wail that pealed
through the night, chilling me. The forest
seemed awake with a sweeping wind. The
horses snorted and stamped, and then there
was the scream of an animal in agony.
“Hell’s curses!” roared Campbell. “Go-
annas ! Get the horses.”
A nightmare of horror enveloped us. From
the forest they came, dropping from over-
hanging branches, igreat, waddling, filthy
brutes with snapping jaws, biting, tearing,
nauseating. The night seemed alive.
I tore free from the jabbing of red-hot
pincers on my wrist and rushed blundering
to the plunging horses. Campbell was
ahead, threshing and cursing. One horse
was down rolling and kicking in the grip of
countless reptiles. Snorting with terror the
other snapped his rope while Campbell clung
to him. “Quickly, for your life,” he shouted.
As the horse plunged forward, both of us
swung to his back.
We reached Coorada with festering body-
gashes and sick in mind. Campbell went
down with fever, and as soon as he could
travel we beat away to the light and warmth
of crowded cities.
But who may side-step his destiny?
To-night a paragraph stares at me from
the evening paper :
The Toll of The Bush.
A message from the Central, West reports the find-
ing by thg'police of the dead body of Rex Campbell,
a well-known identity in the out-back country. It
appears his horse arrived at Lockspur station, on the
fringe of the dry-belt country, and a search-party
went out to seek him. It is surmised the horse
broke camp and Campbell perished from thirst. When
found, the body was almost unrecognisable owing
to severe mutilation, apparently by goannas.
BILL O’B.
The Gamble.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BRODY, the owner of Taloonda, walked
cautiously along the south side of
the men’s hut and peered through an
open window. It was just as he had ex-
pected. Jim Cluney and Joe Connors were
comfortably on the floor, with their backs
against the wall. A drowsy game of cards
was in progress.
Under ordinary circumstances Brody
would have fired them on the spot. The
war, however, had left mo:*e work than
workers on the sheepruns _ of Westei'n
Queensland. Brody knew his men thor-
oughly. He was obliged to feed them, humor
them, pay them good wages and hope and
pray that they might by chance bestir them-
selves and accomplish something.
This condition had ceased to be a worry
to the squatter. He knew the situation
would in time right itself, so he took it all
in good humor. “I hate to bother you fel-
lows,” he said with a laugh. “I’m sliort
three steers. I wish you would go as far
south as the old hut and look around. Walk
down and take your time —it’s pretty hot
in the sun.”
Cluney and Connors dusted their trousers,
gathered, up their cards and sauntered across
the paddock. Six hours later Brody called
Larry McDermott, the cook. “Take this
note down to the old hut, Larry,” he said.
“Jim and Joe are down there awaiting
orders, I suppose.”
* * * *
Cluney and Connors stepped to the door
of the old hut and looked at the road leading
to the homestead.
“Here comes Larry. I’ll bet the boss sent
him out to see what we are doing,” said
Cluney.
“Wouldn’t be surprised,” replied Connors.
“If the old man knew we had been sitting
here all day playing cards he would be as
mad as a horse-fly in a garage. The cook
has a message all right—notice how impor-
tant he looks. He walks as if he was riding
on horseback.”
McDermott drew within hailing distance
and waved an envelope. “Walked five miles
to bring’ this, and it’ll cost you five bob to
read it,” he shouted.
“It ain’t worth it,” retorted Cluney.
“Come here. We want a match. Me and
Joe ain’t had a smoke for two hours.”
The cook put the envelope in his pocket
and handed Cluney the matches. All three
rolled cigarettes and went inside.
“Five bob for the note,” demanded McDer-
mott, placing the matchbox on a corner of
the rickety table.
“Ten bob or nothing,” replied Cluney, ban-
teringly. “We’ll draw for it. 0 He pro-
duced a dirty pack of cards.
With due ceremony they cut and turned
up the cards. The cook won. “That’s ten
bob you owe me,” he said. “Tell you what
I’ll do. Make it a quid or nothing. Cut
again.” , . „ , ™
“A quid or nothing,” agreed Cluney.
Outside the sunlight was suddenly cut off.
Greyish clouds rose over the horizon and
moved slowly westward. A puffy wind
kicked up little swirls of dust.
“A quid or nothing,” repeated Cluney.
Slowly and deliberately, after muttering a
few words that didn’t seem to mean any-
thing, he turned a card. The cook’s cere-
mony over the cutting was, as always, even
more complex and elaborate. Finally he
turned a card and won.
The wind gave a hollow moan as it eddied
about the hut. The entire sky was overcast
now. A few drops of rain spattered on the
roof. .. ~ ,
“Two quid or nothing, said the cook.
Connors sat motionless. Cluney began his
mumbling and muttering preparatory to the
draw. Came a swish of wind and rain. A
loose sheet of iron on the roof clattered.
“Hurry up,” urged Connors. “We had
better read that letter.”
“What’s the flamin’ hurry?” growled
Cluney as he turned a seven of spades.
McDermott then began his incantations. He
waved his hands and ruffled his hair and
shouted hoarsely above the din of the storm.
A terrific rain beat down on the plain—a
veritable cloudburst. Momentarily the wind
increased in force. Again the cook turned
his card and won. Cluney was desperate.
“Three quid or nothing,” he roared.
For ten minutes or so Cluney walked in
circles, and danced and waved his arms.
Then he turned a five of hearts and collapsed.
Now it was the cook’s turn, and not to be
outdone he indulged in a most terrifying orgy
of supplication to old Lady Luck, ile out-
stayed Cluney by five minutes and turned a
six of hearts.
“A fiver or nothing,” he screamed in com-
petition with the wind and rain. The water
was now a foot deep in the hut, and the
matches were floating under the table. Tak-
ing off his boots he danced in his socks. Then
he turned a card and won. So dark was
it now that it was almost impossible to dis-
tinguish the cards.
“Make it exciting,” shouted Connors, or
it’ll be too dark to see who wins.”
“A tenner or nothing,” yelled Cluney, and
—turned an ace.
McDermott grabbed a card and peered at
it with his nose an inch away. It was a
deuce. “Nothing,” he cried. “I lose. Here’s
the letter.”
With water up to their waists they opened
it; but now the interior of the hut was an
inky black, and not a single word was recog-
nisable.
* * * *
At dawn next morning three men, in
water to their necks, clung to the old hut
as it floated down the Georgina. The first
streak of grey was overspreading the east-
ern horizon. The rain had ceased.
Reaching into a pocket, Cluney produced
a soggy envelope. He spread the note on
the roof of the hut and read what the boss
had written to them the day before: “You
fellows had better knock off work and come
on in. It looks like rain."

After firing, just slide the fore-end back and
forward, which operation ejects the empty
case and passes a cartridge instantly from
the magazine into the chamber—and repeat.
May be taken apart without tools. The barrel,
therefore, may be cleaned from the breech.
The breech block is easily removed so that the
mechanism and bore can be kept in perfect
