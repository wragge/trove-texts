A MELBOURNE BOOKSELLER
The memoirs of the Melbourne
bookseller A. H. Spencer, The Hill of
Content, are published by the firm
that bought him out, Angus and
Robertson, of Sydney; but it is some-
thing like the return of the prodigal
son (though certainly not in rags),
because Spencer grew up in Angus and
Robertson’s, and left them only to
strike out on his own in Melbourne.
In fact, the best part of the book is
about his early days in Sydney. He
was not only trained, but impulsively
sacked, and then warmly reinstated, by
the great George Robertson himself:—
Like all outstanding men, G.R.
had one outstanding fault —I knew
of no other fault in him —which was,
roaring at his staff....As I was
working alongside G.R. he became
impatient... .He roared at me. I
stood still and looked at him, for he
had never before subjected me to
the keelhaul treatment. Shouting
“Don’t stand there looking at me
with your bloody wooden face!”
the Chief almost shook hands with
a seizure. It was a Friday... .The
following Monday, upon his return
at 9 a.m., the edict went forth:
“Send Spencer to me! ” My
“insolence” had been chewed over,
and the verdict was: “Spencer, I’m
going to sack you, go and get your
pay.”
But the other A. & R. genius, Fred
Wymark, got Spencer back, keeping
him out of Robertson’s way, and in a
month Robertson was competing with
Wymark for Spencer’s aid, and a while
later Robertson said, “Spencer, you
are too skinny. I want you to come
and eat with me every night for a
month”—
and I did very well out of it, for,
while he used time reading Walter
Jeffery’s newspaper, the “Evening
News,” I, too young to bother
about newspapers, being hungry also,
kept on eating.
So if the visitor to A. & R.’s gets the
feeling, not unfamiliar to the present
reviewer, that it is not as other book-
sellers are, it is maybe because there is
still some of Robertson’s capricious
glory about it.
Spencer has some brilliant and
often-told stories of the two great col-
lectors Mitchell and Dixson:—
By the time I, as a lad, came into
contact with Mitchell he was an
invalid. So that is the picture I
retain of him, sitting in his favorite
old armchair, with eyes eager and
bright, waiting . . . waiting for
something to turn up.
Mitchell liked his little joke, and
it wasn’t always kind: —
If he exclaimed “By jove, that’s a
thing I’ve always wanted! ” and
bubbled with glee, it was a danger
signal. Be careful. This was one of
his ways of getting a little fun out
of the game. He had no intention
•of purchasing your article, either
because he already had a copy of it,
or really didn’t want it. But he
did want to hear the seller roll out
a prosperous, healthy price, so that
the disappointment of rejection
would express itself right from his
hair to his boots.
Spencer speaks-up nobly for Henry
Lawson: “Weaknesses apart .... a
natural, true mystic. Many times after
J. G. Lockley had awakened me to it,
I saw that amazing unearthly-spiritual
expression in Henry’s face”; and he
has a good story about him:—
One of my earliest recollections of
Henry is of the fun he had with
Angus and Robertson’s errand-boys,
of whom I was one. We would
place a large empty case on a hand-
truck, Henry would lie in it, the
only visible parts of him at either
end of the case being his head and
feet, and we took turns at giving him
a fast ride. Once the case fell off
the truck with Henry in it; it turned
right over and there he was,
trapped. Some scared boys freed
him, and when Henry could stop
laughing he spent his time comfort-
ing the boy who upset him.
There is a picture of W. M. Hughes
rushing out of A. & R.’s after being
told they didn’t have Jowett’s transla-
tion of Plato, snorting “Good Lord!
Not a copy to be had? What in hell
do the people read?” and John Norton
and H. D. Mclntosh, both “Napoleon
addicts”; and how Mclntosh paid-up
to help a beautiful widow, who had
only her husband’s library, of little
value, finance her return to England.
But about his best story of handsome
doers is the story of how he asked
H. L. White, of Belltrees, Scone, to
finance him in Melbourne:—
H.L.W.: Why do you wish to
see me?
A.H.S.: I want you to lend me a
thousand pounds.
H.L.W.: Just like that, eh? All
right, you can have it. What do you
want it for?
Then Spencer goes on:—
When he had given you his trust
he first said, “You can have it,” and
only then: “What do you want it
for?” I must add that he lent it
without any security whatever....
“Here is the money, Mr. Spencer,
try not to lose it, but if you do your
best and fail, and lose this money,
try not to worry too much about
it.”
Spencer worried, but paid it back
in three years, with seven per cent,
interest; and worked so hard for ten
years in Melbourne that in 1932 he
collapsed, and had to take six weeks
off to recover.
Early in his Melbourne career, in
1924, he met Melba, who had been
sent by a friend to see his “fine old
books,” and a little later Beverley
Nichols, browsing over the counters,
fled to an inner room when Melba’s
car arrived outside, fearing to be told
to go somewhere or do something by
his august employer:—
Beverley Nichols’s imprisonment
lasted only fifteen minutes, for that
day Melba came in only to say,
“Where is your wife? Go and get
her; I must talk with her, she does
me g00d.”.... I was not surprised to
find that Mr. Nichols was not
anxious to emerge.... he had dis-
covered. ... .the Second Folio Shak-
speare, and first editions of Paradise
Lost, The Pilgrim’s Progress, The
Faerie Queene, The Anatomy of
Melancholy, Gulliver’s Travels and
Hakluyt’s Voyages. ... .1 was then, in
1923 and onwards, dispersing the
finest library yet sold in Australia,
the amazing collection of Robert
Sticht, of Queenstown, Tasmania.
Spencer could also afford to be
smug when the young aide-de-camp to
the Governor-General, Lord Forster,
Captain Alan Lawrence, mentioned
that he’d been searching for years for
Mariner’s “Tonga”:—
“It’s hardly worth giving you its
name, because you are not likely to
meet with a copy”....
Maintaining a poker face, I said,
(Continued on page 58)
WILDERNESS THEME
I saw that country in a dream
—its empty earth, its searing breath,
its burning stones, its stars —the land
some know as life and some as death.
I trudged across unending plains
(hero or midget, which was I?),
while from above stared down at me
a vastness of unwinking sky.
I did not heed the dried-up creeks,
/ did not feel the blowing sand,
but, like Sturt’s pattering sheep, my days
gained strength from what seemed barren
ground.
I seek again that scene in dreams
—the blazing stars, the ochre earth,
the stones, the shining flowers —the land
some see as life and some as death.
Dingoes may race to gnaw my bones,
the roaring winds unearth my skull;
say only this—that all my days
with that persistent search were full.

THE SUMMIT AND BLOCS
r T"'HE difficulties of the West in
negotiation with the Iron Curtain
countries is illustrated by the after-
maths of the visits of Khrushchev to
the United States and China.
Apparently openhanded with his
lavish offers of peace and disarma-
ment, Khrushchev was able to use the
forum of the United Nations to say his
piece in a way that would make him
heard throughout the world, and then
return to Asia to bolster the morale
of a sullen and aggressive China which
is gradually gobbling the border-
lands surrounding it and threatening
its friendly neighbors.
To Moscow the United Nations is
merely an instrument for forwarding
its policy of world-conquest by sub-
version, and to be used for its own
purposes, especially for the purpose
of promoting enmity towards Moscow’s
special enemies.
TT-HRUSHCHEV’S performances in
the United States and since have
been based on a derisive appreciation
of what was likely to happen in the
West, where open expression of opinion
by the press is still permitted and where
strong countries do not determine the
lines of policy of adjacent weak
countries by rolling across their fields
with tank-divisions and closing their
borders to turn them into slave-camps,
as has been done by the U.S.S.R.
throughout Eastern Europe.
The approach to the discussions of
peace, on the Iron Curtain side, is
marked by an enforced unity which is
impossible on the side of the Western
nations, because behind the Iron
Curtain the strong suppress tendencies
to adopt procedures according with
various racial and national charac-
teristics which are apparent in the
West. At the same time, having their
own underground, their parlor-pinks
and professorial and press sympa-
thisers in every Western country, the
Communists are able to secure full
publicity for these differences and
sometimes to accentuate them for
Communist benefit.
All this is very much apparent at
the present time. The Soviet Union,
through Khrushchev, has been able to
adopt the initiative as the inventor of
disarmament, to the disadvantage of
those who disarmed after World War
11, in contradistinction to Russia, which
armed itself and every rebel band
which seemed likely to succeed in
Communist revolution, China and
North Korea included, thus forcing
the war-tired West to rearm on a
world-scale in its own defence.
Moscow has also gained the initia-
tive and applies the gag on outside
discussion of the disarmament ideal,
with the angry bullying by Khrushchev
of everybody whom he met during his
U.S. tour who dared to imply that
Russians and Chinese were not all by
nature doves of peace. These crushing
attacks on individuals were made with
calculated fury to impress the unthink-
ing and to encourage the idea that he
is touchy enough to call everything off
if criticised.
Khrushchev’s carefully-timed state-
ments made since his return home are
calculated to bring to world attention
the differences between Western nations
and the apparent firm adherence of
Russia to the principles of a disarmed
peace. A main ingredient of his tactic
has been to state openly again and
again his conviction that there are still
powerful elements in the West hostile
to peace and dedicated to aggressive
intentions.
/Tj'RADUALLY the evidence is
accumulating that Khrushchev is
no more in earnest about disarmament,
except for obtaining advantage for the
Communist party’s long-term pro-
gramme, than he has ever been. His
attitude to the world seems to be that
the only Power that matters in the West
is the United States, and that he can
ignore the rest. If he could secure an
agreement with the United States to
control the world that would suit him.
And this is what he means when he
speaks of the Communist and capitalist
worlds living together.
Last week, to show how little he is
afraid of the United States, while
kindly consenting to treat it as a
partner in running the globe, he asked
the world to believe that a U.S. diplo-
matic attache deliberately met a
Russian traitor in an open street a
block from the U.S. Embassy in Mos-
cow, and at nine-o’clock in the morn-
ing, when passing crowds were going
to work, handed him a bag so obvi-
ously containing a huge sum of money
that bus-passengers rang the M.V.D.,
whose myrmidons found that the
conspirators had conveniently pro-
longed their kerbside chat so that they
could be caught in the act of exchang-
ing espionage secrets in writing. And
the Kremlin then allowed this vicious
U.S. spy to go, though he was liable to
be shot under Soviet criminal law.
Mr. Macmillan apparently is in
favor of an immediate summit-
conference on the principle that the
sooner it takes place the less interval
there will be in which to subvert it.
The Western European countries are
of the same mind, but wish to have a
main line of discussion decided before
going into the debate.
U.S. State Department and the
A American press (which has a habit
of following its view) seem to want a
nice long series of chats as a pre-
liminary, but only after world opinion
has been convinced that Western
Europe is at sixes-and-sevens and
the only way in which unity can be
achieved is through a conference in
which the chief negotiators will be
swamped by a huge mob of junketing
secretaries and advisers.
Other nations involved may wish
to avoid this and make discussion a
clean-cut informal debate by four or
five leaders behind closed doors. But
they are dragged into the crowd-
technique by the example of the U.S.
The propaganda to prove the rifts
among Western European leaders
(and particularly their supposed con-
tempt for and hostility to Mr. Mac-
millan and the United Kingdom) before
Khrushchev’s visit to the United States
proved spurious. But this has not
prevented the resurrection of the same
propaganda now, when the United
Kingdom Government is pressing to
get the summit-meeting over before a
preliminary campaign of manoeuvre
and accusations of Western differences
give Russia an advantage at the
meeting.
r rHE real need seems to be for the
Big Four or Five to meet as soon as
possible, and it will be fatal for the
West to go as a concerted bloc led by
the United States to present an ulti-
matum. Each partner in the West
should be able to fight for its indi-
vidual viewpoint untrammelled by
prior agreements, if some scheme can
be thrashed-out which is very
doubtful.
At the same time they should all
remember that there are other nations,
in the British Commonwealth in par-
ticular, whose strength will make them
major factors in the world within the
next 25 years, if they are not now.
Nobody is going to dictate a defence-
policy to Australia, for instance, while
Indonesia threatens Dutch New
Guinea and China insists on pressing
down on South Asian countries.


"We've gotta climb this western summit, Charles, before we tackle the big one."


PLAIN ENGLISH
A Premier Passes
Leaving the caucus-room for a few
minutes before the end of the party-
meeting last Wednesday, John Joseph
Cahill, Premier of N.S.W., entered
Sydney Hospital shortly afterwards on
the advice of a doctor hastily summoned
by his colleagues. A reassuring bulletin
was issued the same evening, but on
Thursday morning his condition de-
teriorated and he died just before noon.
Before entering hospital the Premier had
apparently had two mild coronary occlu-
sions ; he suffered a third just before
his death and, a few hours earlier, a
stomach haemorrhage from a burst
ulcer. It is significant that both these
conditions are associated with strain,
worry and overwork.
Mr. Cahill had been in the N.S.W.
(with one break of three
years) since 1925 and had been Premier
since 1952. Born in Redfern in 1891,
he served his apprenticeship as a fitter
with the Railways Department, but lost
his job through his activities in the 1917
transport strike. For a while he sold
insurance, unsuccessfully contested the
Dulwich Hill seat, worked again as a
fitter, and was elected M.L.A. for St.
George. After redistribution in 1930
he came back as member for Arncliffe,
was Government Whip under J. T. Lang,
lost his seat in 1932, regained it three
years later and continued to hold it at
successive elections to the end.
When the first McKell Government
was formed in 1941 Cahill became
Minister for Works; after the 1944
election he was given the Local Govern-
ment portfolio as well. Deputy Premier
(in succession to J. M. Baddeley) in
1949, he became Premier when J. J.
McGirr resigned in April, 1952.
As Premier he led his party to victory
in three successive elections while Labor
was being defeated or losing ground in
other States and in the Federal sphere.
As a political tactician he had few equals
and it is doubtful whether any other
man could have kept the Parliamentary
Labor party in N.S.W. intact during
the faction-fights that followed the
Hobart conference in 1954. In June last
he passed the previous record (set by
Bertram Stevens) for the longest con-
tinuous term as Premier of N.S.W. At
his death he had served seven years, six
months and 21 days in that post.
Putting aside all the fulsome flattery
of people who hated Cahill at 10 a.m.
on Thursday and searched for super-
latives to describe him two hours later,
he had these merits: No Premier was
ever a harder worker, none was eyer
more called on to bear fools gladly or
was more adept in disposing of the
serried legions within his party who
believed they had a right to give him
orders. He had the virtue of being able
to divorce politics from private life —
though The Bulletin, was one of his
most acid critics he arranged to lunch
with a Bulletin man only a few days
before he died. He had a real love of
the Australian tradition, a real interest
in history, and his particular pride was
in his services to music and art, though
he claimed no expert knowledge of or
sensitivity to either. A sound family
man, in his private moments he was a
friendly soul even when sorely tried.
His one real, bred-in-the-bone hate:
daily newspapers.
Recruiting Efficiency
The return of the Third Battalion of the
Royal Australian Regiment, part of the
spearhead of Australian defence and of
the Regular cadre from which our forces
would be expanded in time of war, is not
very creditable to the spirit of young
Australians.
The Third Battalion was supposed to
vacate the field to the First Battalion,
which relieved it at Penang early in
October, but in order to leave its relief
with effective strength it has come home
short of 300 men.
The explanation seems to be a lag in
recruiting, and this is very difficult to
understand in the face of the tradition of
the three battalions, which rose phcenix-
like out of the proud Australian 34th
Brigade, which represented the Com-
monwealth for six years in the occupa-
tion of Japan.
They were —under their original
numbers, inscribed in Roman letters on
their sleeves —about the most noticeable
of all troops in Japan, bearing them-
selves with a decorum and neatness that
made Australians who saw them in the
streets or on parade proud and some
other nationals envious.
They fought finely in Korea —all three
battalions —under their new names, show-
ing determination and adaptability.
The Third Battalion came out of it
with the right to wear the American
Presidential-citation flash and with a
corps of seasoned officers and men who
have since done much in moulding the
new-type defence-forces of the Common-
wealth.
In Malaya their record is equally dis-
tinguished. They have won a number of
decorations and. a reputation as “fight-
ing tigers” and adaptable, tough bushmen.
It is inexplicable that there are not
among an Australian population of
10,000,000 enough youngsters with
adventurous spirits to keep the three
battalions full and even running over.
The life is good and brisk, the living-
conditions at Penang and for men during
long spells are certainly equal to those
of civilian life. Indeed, families return-
ing with the Third Battalion describe it
as “luxurious” and bemoan their now
lost leisure.
Possibly the approach in the appeals
for recruits is the wrong one. It concen-
trates on the material advantages and pay
and makes little or no appeal to the
adventurous or the romantic.
Certainly the whole technique of
recruiting and measures in general for
assuring that there is a properly-trained
nucleus of experienced regular troops
always up to strength seems to need
overhaul.
They Call It "Peace"
As the truth about the Communist-front
Australian and New Zealand Congress
for International Co-operartion and Dis-
armament dawns belatedly on them,
prominent citizens and Church authori-
ties are withdrawing their support.
At the weekend the assembled Aus-
tralian Anglican bishops condemned the
congress and Professor A. K. Stout with-
drew his sponsorship.
A move is being made to get the
Baptists out of it, while many individual
clerics are finding they will be busy
during the congress, or would like more
information.
Yet the facts are clear. It was
organised by the World Peace Council,
itself a Communist-front organisation;
its organiser, Goldbloom, is an A.L.P.
man with a record of co-operation with
the Communist party ; the date it opens,
November 7, is the national Russian
day, and its first public announcement
contained the statement that the Aus-
tralian delegates unanimously supported
recognition of Red China and its admis-
sion to the U.N.
The Rev. Norman St. C. Anderson, a
Congregational minister, who is a
national sponsor of the congress and a
member of the planning-committee, got
some shocks on a TV-programme. He
had to admit he had not seen a pamphlet
put out by the Ringwood branch of the
congress describing three clergymen who
had refused to attend a local meeting
as having dingoed ; and he was stunned
to see a congress report that 21 Aus-
tralian delegates to a Communist-
sponsored youth-festival in Vienna had
pledged themselves as active workers for
the congress.
It is natural that any organisation
with the word “peace” in its title should
attract Christian leaders, but disillusion-
ment comes tardily.
The plainest description of the congress
was that by the Morwell R.S.L. sub-
branch, which called it a Communist
conspiracy; and the speech by Gold-
bloom to the Methodist conference
certainly had a chilling undertone:
“Those who condemn the congress and
do not attend it will be recorded as
stubborn people unwilling to contribute
to world peace,” he promised.
Recorded by whom?
Monash University
By slapping-down for general reading
the report of the Universities Commis-
sion on the proposed Monash University,
the Prime Minister, without saying a
word, gave an effective answer to
criticism by Premier Bolte and others
of the Commonwealth’s delay in making
known its proposed contributions to the
cost of the new university.
The commission is critical of what
has been done so far by both the Bolte
Government and the Monash interim
council. It is dismayed to find that the
interim council had commissioned
architects to prepare plans for the science
buildings before appointing the pro-
fessors, and rather more dismayed,


apparently, by the estimate of the cost
of site-preparation between the current
month and December, 1960 —£759,000.
The commission does not accept this
as realistic. The Murray Committee (in
1957) was led to believe that a site would
be found on Crown land, but the cost
of the privately-owned 287-acre site at
Clayton, an outer-Melbourne suburb,
was given at £650,000.
Pruning the Bolte-Monash expense-
account, the commission goes on to
say that, as about half of the site is
occupied by an epileptic colony which
it was proposed to settle elsewhere on
Crown land (relieving the State Govern-
ment of the necessity of buying it), and
making provision for a hospital and the
C.5.1.R.0., the cost for university pur-
poses appears to be £214,700.
The commission is prepared to pass
this amended account and to assist with
the cost on a £-for-£ basis. This provides
a peg on which to hang a warning to
all universities that the Commonwealth
cannot assist unless it has the oppor-
tunity of considering all proposals before
a State or university enters into a • firm
agreement. The commission offers other
subsidies to Monash and agrees that the
claims for the second Melbourne uni-
versity are special.
Premier Bolte’s pained surprise at the
publication of the report is remarkable.
The Victorian public was entitled to be
fully informed of this criticism, and of
the reasons for the Commonwealth’s
hesitancy.
George Catlett Marshall
[By “Ek Dum”J
Half - forgotten outside his own
country, General of the Army George
Catlett Marshall, U.S. Chief of Staff
1939-45, later Secretary of State and
Secretary for Defence in the American
Cabinet, was 78 when he passed out in
the Walter Reed Army Hospital at
Washington.
More picturesque soldiers have con-
sistently attracted the attention of
reporters, but the fact remains that
Marshall was the unassuming creator
of the forces of his country and their de-
ployment and equipment at a time when
the Western world stood in dire peril.
Not a spectacular or imaginative
figure as a general, there was no doubt
about his overall virtues as a planner
and organiser or about his calm head
and his readiness to learn —or to scrap
operations and types of thinking at the
possible expense of his reputation when
convinced that he was wrong.
As a young officer Marshall served
with distinction in the Philippines and
in World War I, but his prqmotion was
only routine and by 1938, at 58, he had
reached the office of Chief of the Plans
Division of the General Staff. He became
Chief of Staff and a general in Septem-
ber, 1939, as the Germans moved into
Poland —an unexpected appointment
made over the heads of several seniors
—and it was primarily due to his fore-
sight and his ability to convince Congress
of what was to come that the United
States had a large assembled force at the
time of Pearl Harbor.
On strategy he came into conflict with
the British, who rightly believed that it
would be courting disaster to attack
across the Channel without thorough
organisation, and he was undoubtedly
wrong in his refusal to agree to
Churchill’s well - conceived plan for
attacking “the soft under-belly’' 1 of
Eastern Europe. Indeed, whenever he
entered the realm of strategy he exhibited
weakness, but his planning ability re-
deemed this failure. He was the man
who chose General Eisenhower for
Supreme Command.
After the war, following a brief period
in China, he became the first military
officer to serve as Secretary of State, the
President’s choice being supported with-
out question by the Senate.
In the post-war years the world had
to thank Marshall for two things. It
was he who finally defeated the vice-
presidential plans of Henry Wallace to
appease Russia and he began re-establish-
ing the strength of American defence
in a manner which probably averted a
Soviet attack on Western Europe. Also
his determination put into action what
is called “The Marshall Plan” —though
it was the baby of others —which gave
needy countries 12-billion dollars in
“Marshall aid” in under four years.
In 1950, during the internal conflict
in the American Cabinet over the Korean
war, he became Secretary of Defence.
He will be remembered in relation to
this period for his courage in having
General MacArthur recalled from
Tokyo and as the man who afterwards
destroyed many of the illusions fostered
about the MacArthur record.
In private life an unassuming man
who repelled attempts to make him a
subject of publicity, he was aloof—so
that it was said of him that he had no
enemies and no nickname. Yet he was
persuasive and a great conciliator and
rationaliser of opinion and his manner
and clarity of expression inspired con-
fidence.
Marshall’s crowning triumph came
when, at 72, he was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize, a remarkable achievement
for a man who had claimed all his life
to be first and foremost a professional
soldier.
A Garden Square Lost
Not on the same lofty plane in which
it was begun, the negotiations between
Underhill, the Melbourne real-estate
concern with English backers, and the
City Council have ended. Underhill has
got the contract to build the £6-million
office-block on the Western Market site,
despite some formidable opposition out-
side the council, and there are bitter
recriminations all round.
The newspapers, which wanted a
garden-square, described the City Coun-
cillors as obstinate, unimaginative, rate-
collectors, revenue-collectors, age-defined,
bluestone civic bookkeepers and small-
town thinkers; individual councillors
were labelled pompous and cheap. The
councillors replied by demanding new
newspapers.
There is no doubt that the majority
of Melburnians would have preferred
an open garden on this city site, but the
campaign for it was so belatedly begun
(on the eve of signing with Underhill,
after a decade’s attempt by the council
to get some body to take-over the site)
and in a tone so violent that it was
inevitable the non-LaboF councillors
would be repelled. Only one of 21 Civic
Group councillors voted with the nine
A.L.P. members.
Good old “vested interests” appeared
in the speeches from both sides; but
there was no real venom in the charges.
It is neither the lust for personal power
nor money that produces in Melbourne
the most passionate fights (particularly
among erstwhile friends), but matters in
which art, taste, civics and aesthetics are
in question.
Yet it is true that a very large number
of those to whom Melbourne usually
looks for artistic and aesthetic guidance
were truly longing for a city breathing-
space of beauty. As usual, however,
they failed to get there fustest with the
mostest.
An Onerous Task
['From Canberra]
Attorney-General Barwick has put an
amazing amount of work into the
uniform-divorce legislation since its in-
troduction some months ago. Aiming
to make it acceptable to most sections of
the community, he has hardly let-up in
his interviews with individuals and
organisations.
As a result he has produced 56
amendments; these will make final
acceptance almost a certainty, but they
will also mean that it is unlikely the
measure will be passed before Christmas.
Even if the Reps, completes its dis-
cussion in time there’s little possibility
of its being disposed of by the Senate
before the adjournment late in November.
The four major amendments which
Barwick proposes are:
(1) That no decree on the grounds of
separation can be made by a court unless
adequate financial arrangements, includ-
ing a property-settlement for the
respondent, have been made by the
petitioner ;
(2) The grouping in a petition for
divorce or separation all relevant matters
to enable them to be dealt with by one
court, instead of a number of indi-
vidual hearings by different courts ;
(3) Power for a court to rescind a
decree nisi in the event of a miscarriage
of justice by fraud or perjury ;
(4) Provision for a court to proceed
to hand-down a maintenance- or custody-
order, even though it refused a petition.
Other amendments will tighten the
structure of the legislation and insert
protective clauses relating to both
petitioner and respondent, and to
children affected by any decree.
If Barwick can get the bill through
Parliament, as expected, it will be a
triumph not only for him but also for
Victorian Liberal Percy Joske, who sub-
mitted a private member’s bill on this
subject a couple of years ago.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
HThe Roman - chariot races at the
Brisbane Bushman’s Carnival were
such a - success that the Showground
authorities want to buy the chariots,
which, by the way, were minus the anti-
pedestrian swords sticking out each side
from the hub-caps. (They had the right
idea about pedestrians in them days.)
No matter how the others tried, the bays
driven by Archie Sugden came home first
every time. As one bookie put it, they’d
be hot favorites in any future races.
Best price he could give about them, he
said, would be VI to IV!—“Sanasi.”

“Ardoyne”: “Lifetime Guarantee”
looks reassuring beside a streamlined
picture of a household appliance, but
whose lifetime? Not the buyer’s, surely:
the most naive young wife scarcely
expects a gadget bought when she is 20
to last until she is 70. A guarantee for
the manufacturer’s or supplier’s lifetime
means little in an era when firms are
constantly folding-up, amalgamating and
being takeover-bidden. So the lifetime
guarantee must refer to the life of the
appliance; i.e., it will go on working
until it stops going on working.
“Tabba”: It surprises me that the
bottle-makers who fought beer-canning
so fiercely didn’t hang some of their
argument on hygiene. Cans stand on
shelves or roll about in cars picking up
dust; can punch-openers lie in slopped
beer, get thrown under the bar un-
washed when not in use, or lie in dirty
corners of car glove-boxes and parcel-
trays. An opener is picked up and
punched through a dusty (or worse)
can-top until the point is submerged in
the beer, which is then poured-out over
the dirty rim of the can. On the other
hand, the crown-top of a bottle protects
the lip over which the beer will be
poured, and the lip is not even touched
by the opener.

“Emel”: Oddest road - accident was
surely a collision between a car and a

It’s obviously distraught, and I have
grave fears that it will be exhausted by
morning. Can you get someone to get

“R.E.”: Well-known Melbourne critic
was giving a lecture on films and the
theatre to prisoners at Pentridge. System
there is to tape the talk and pipe it
through to the cells at a more suitable
time. When the critic had been recorded,
one of the old inmates brought in after-
noon-tea, saying apologetically, “Sorry
the bun’s a bit crook. It’s a pity more
good cooks don’t turn to crime.”
“M.E.D.”: Dismayed at finding a
large number of refrigerators still on

were bought, to run themselves in at their
leisure.

THE SYDNEY CIRCUS
“Argument is proceeding whether the
Commonwealth Government should change its
plans for a huge square block of buildings
on the extension of Elizabeth Street, Sydney,
to conform with plans for a circus to which
the Qantas building has already contributed
a curved facade.”
A new proposal's come to irk us:
Elizabeth Street's extension-circus.
An architectural stamping-ground
With all its buildings circling round,
And open as a motorist’s grin
To chase irate pedestrians in.
And in the centre there will be
A fountain topped by statuary
Where pigeons drink from the same font
as
Flyers from the nest of Qantas
And bill and coo the cons and pros
With heads of Commonwealth
bureaux.
And tourists from far-distant places
Will stare with wide, astonished faces,
While those of us who have to work’ll
Never venture in that circle,
But go about our own affairs,
Because we're just a lot of squares.

"llt/HEN I read out the news-item about
V' the N.Z. police-force taking male
recruits at 19 years but women at not
below 23, and a police training-school
instructor saying “Women haven’t much

tartly: “I can quite understand that when
it comes to men there’s not much point

“Sister Ellell”: None like the Irish for
cashing-in ; but no one could say they’re
not ingenious. Flying by their domestic
airline from Dublin to London, I was
entranced by the chrome-and-green
plane, the black-and-green upholstery, the
black-and-green carpet, and the hostess
smart in a green suit (they’re often red-
haired, tool). Rain and wind outdid
each other, and I found myself sitting
next to an Irish priest of lugubrious
mien. We taxied, and quick-smart were
in the air. The priest gazed out of the
window at the rain-lashed darkness, and
-then addressed me for the first time:
“It’s a desperate night!” Blimey! So I
ordered myself a double-whisky; and
when it came, the little glass was liberally
besprinkled with bright green shamrocks.
Whether they did the trick, or it was
just the luck of the Oirish, I dunno, but
that I’m alive to write this assures that
it wasn’t too desperate.

“Miss M.”: Discussion here of board-
ing-schools with most boarders sent me
to the Australian Encyclopaedia to settle
another old argument: which Australian
hospital has most beds? The Encyclo-
paedia plumped for Sydney’s Royal
Prince Alfred, which with its ancillaries,
Gloucester House and the King George
V Hospital, has 1398 beds. But what
about those huge Army hospitals at
Concord (N.S.W.) and Heidelberg (Vic.),
now given over to Repat.? And what
about Brisbane’s “largest hospital in the
Southern Hemisphere?” Ah, here we
are: “The Brisbane General Hospital,
which includes the Wattlebrae Hospital
for Infectious Diseases, Rosemount
Orthopaedic Dept., Brisbane Children’s
Hospital and the Women’s Hospital, has
2416 beds.” That’s more like it, but how
does it accord with the claim, a few lines
above, that R.P.A. is Australia’s largest?

a cup of tea. Management referred me
to the waitress, who showed me where
she kept the tea, sugar, electric-jug and
biscuits. Tourist official at the next book-
ing-office quite approved the idea as he
collected the next b-and-b fee from me.

that the Russian Bear should get the first
squint at the other side of the moon,
but nobody seems to have recalled the
discovery of that other Bruin whose
curiosity was recorded in a rollicking

chorus of our youth. To the tune of
“F’r’e’s a jolly good fellow” it ran:
“Oh, the bear went over the mountain”
—repeato, to lead up to: “To see what
he could see.” Whereupon the heavy
artillery came in with: “And what did
he see? And what did he see?” The
answer was always delivered with super-
gusto: “The other side of'the mountain.

than expected, I received a clarification-
list all right. At the bottom it stated
that a fee of 2s. would be added to the

“Doynest”: The Sydney clerk who
collected child endowment for a
fictitious family of seven children re-
minded me of an odd-job man our firm
employed. As paymaster, I knew from
his tax-concession form that he had four
young children, and one day he con-
fided that his wife had gone to hospital
for a fifth. The little woman pulled
through, but with mounting hospital and
medical bills the poor chap was at his
wit’s end for money to clothe the new-
comer. Some of us spoke to our wives;
they rustled up a huge collection of dis-
carded baby-wear, and we gave it to
Bert. He didn’t know how to thank us.
A few days later he was in police
custody, having been nabbed overnight
making-off with some of the firm’s goods
in a sack. Bert had a record, it
appeared —but a wife and kids didn’t
figure in it.
“Ardoyne”: After qualifying for the
Victorian public service last December,
my elder Tad accepted employment else-
where, didn’t take to the work, and
decided to sound-out prospects in the
p.s. again. The officers who interviewed
him were helpful and businesslike,
arranging for him to be admitted with-
out re-examination or repetition of other
formalities, and within a few days he
was working in a branch that appealed
to him and was suited to his aptitudes.
We felt that the State public service was
grossly maligned by the jokes about red-
tape and departmental delays: few
private employers would have dealt with
his application more promptly or
efficiently. That was two months ago ;
now my son has received a letter
advising that his application for appoint-
ment has been approved and that he
will be notified when he will be required
to take up duty!

“Ex-ACT”: As a modest sherry-,

I read The Bulletin Wine and Food
section (B. 14/10/’59) with avid appre-
ciation. The section on sparkling wines


evoked some nostalgia, because 1
haven’t had any for years. A lot of
sparkling burgundy went out of my thin
pay-envelope during my courting-days
of more than 30 years ago, and I vividly
recall my first encounter with cham-
pagne. As a young cadet at the opening
of a new insurance-building in Collins
Street, Melbourne—at, I think, 11 a.m. —■
I found the speeches brief, but the hos-
pitality lavish, including innumerable
bottles of French champagne (this was
the year 1923). When I hit the pavement
I realised it would be absurd to go back
to the office, because I wouldn’t be able
There! Just as I always said — blue-velvet drapes and sequins !”
to write, anyway. I sheltered in a picture-
show until well after 6 p.m., and then,
knowing the chief-of-staff would have
gone to dinner, I crept in, wrote a few
pars, and departed homeward, still
cheerful. How many Australian re-
porters get French champagne on the job
these days?

“Eureka”: A woman who lives up the
street entered the telephone-box near my
ho'me at 9.30 a.m. and was still there at
midday. I decided to ask her if she
would mind concluding her conversation
because I wanted to make an urgent call,
but just before I reached the door of
the box she hung-up and came out.
“Considering the price we have to pay
for telephone-calls,” she said to me, “one
would think they’d provide seats in these
boxes.”
HTHEY were really in the groove,
rockin’-’n’-rollin’ with that peculiar
gravity and intensity which the exercise
demands. The skirts of the girls
swirled high, revealing various degrees
of daintiness or originality in pantees.
The electrician noticed that one girl
was wearing luminous pants, so promptly
threw the switch and left the hall in dark-
ness. Then he trained a spotlight on the
girl; the musicians kept playing, the
couple kept dancing, and all anyone

dipping and swaying to the rhythm.—-

distant. Around Sydney Harbor, Port
Phillip Bay, etc., a great deal of coast-
line is becoming inaccessible. Retention
of part of the national shorelines is the
aim of a bill introduced in the U.S.
Senate, authorising the Secretary of the
Interior to acquire nearly half-a-million
acres of land bordering the oceans and
lakes at a cost of 50-million dollars, to
be supplemented by an additional 35-
million from private gifts. What is being

quite a few of the pages are devoted to
recipes for rich dishes and cakes, fatten-
ing sauces, cream and chocolate. Color-
ful, mouth-watering illustrations of the
finished articles are there alongside the
recipes. It’s Dante’s Inferno rewritten
for the kitchen.
TRAIT BON!
“A French psychiatrist says that nobody is

Alt your chromosomes, together
With your genes, settle whether
You will turn out brilliant, or become

Be a gargoyle or a beauty,
Have a lofty sense of duty,
A yen for peace, or urge to spill some

An influence pre-natal
May determine if your• pate’ll
Keep cool, or you’ll get het-up, in a
jam.
But the bearer of the banner
Of a very cocky manner
Can’t put the blame for it on sire or
dam.
So, if you would be detested
And occasionally molested,
Not bothering Life’s rose-stem to
de-thorn,
Be aware that Mother Nature
Quite forgot to germinate your
Mind with bumptious arrogance when
you were born.
You must set-out to acquire it.
There’ll be fewer who’ll admire it
Than want to bounce a brickbat off
your bun.
Oh, it’s great to be a magger
With cocksureness, swank and swagger—
Until you meet a far, far better one !

SHIPS ARE SUCH FUN!
By "PATTO"
f\NE of the charming things
about sea-travel is the way
in which you are asked by your
friends to look-up certain
people on board. Week after
week before you sail, someone
is bound to say, “Oh, I hear
you’re sailing on the Negombo.
You really must look-up the
Cairngorms. They have a
Shorthorn stud at Tumble-
weed, you know ; distant con-
nections of mine ; you’ll find
them awfully nice.” So by
the time the ship sails, your
occipital cortex is simply
bursting with names.
But somehow with the battle
in the Bight, the heat of the
Indian Ocean and the fact that
you have your own friends, you
just don’t catch-up or can’t
be bothered. Then one day as
you are having a gin with some-
one, a gent breezes up to the
table and says to your friend,
“How about some bridge
tonight, Tompkins?” “Righto,
Cairngorm,” he replies. “By
the way, do you know my
friend Herbert?” “No, I don’t
think so,” says Cairngorm.
“Are you related to the Her-
berts of Tanglefoot Creek?”
“No,” I tell him, “I live in
Sydney”; and he gives me a
strange look that seems to say,
“Ah! Another of those city
parasites who live off the backs
of my Shorthorns and
Merinos.” The rest of the
conversation goes something
like this.
Herbert: Sit down and
have a drink.
Cairngorm : Thanks. I’ll
have a beer.
Herbert : I was asked to
look you up by the Ponds, of
Point Piper, but somehow I’ve
never got around to it.
Cairngorm: Oh, you know
them, do you? Some distant
connections of my missus.
Herbert : I hear you’re
going over to buy some cattle.
Cairngorm : Oh, yes, I’ll
probably buy a couple of prize
bulls.
Tompkins : All right, so long
as you don’t make too many
yourself, Cairngorm.. Ha! Ha!
Herbert : I hear they’re very
expensive. What do you expect
to pay?
Cairngorm : Oh, coupla-
thousand guineas, I suppose.
What line are you in?
Herbert : Art-collecting.
Cairngorm: What? You
mean etchings and that sort of
thing?
Herbert: As a matter of
fact, I’m hoping to buy a
Picasso.
Cairngorm: What the hell’s
that? Sounds like the name
of a horse out of something-
or-other.
Herbert: Not at all. It’s
an oil-painting that will prob-
ably cost three- or four-
thousand quid.
Cairngorm : That don’t
make sense to me —in fact, it
sounds damned stupid—paying
all that for a picture.
Herbert: (A bit riled.) Well,
it’s not stupid to me. And let
me tell you that after your
2000-guinea bull has served its
purpose and his perishing hide
is in the soles of shoes plod-
ding along Pitt Street, this
Picasso picture will still be
going strong and will probably
then be worth twice what I pay
for it.
Cairngorm : Well, I’ve never
even heard of them —not in
my line. Well, must be getting
along. See you later. (Mutter-
ing.) Picasso be damned. He
must be crazy. I’d rather have
a bull.

POLITICAL POINTS
After a long history of “always the
bridesmaid, never the bride,” R. J.
Heffron, by an unexpected turn of the
wheel, found himself on Friday Premier
of N.S.W. Twenty years ago he missed-
out by one vote when N.S.W. Labor was
choosing a leader to replace Lang and
in 1947 he lost again by the same
margin. W. J. McKell beat him on the
first occasion; J. J. McGirr on the
second. Heffron didn't contest the
leadership when McGirr resigned, but
was chosen as Deputy Leader, and has
held the position ever since. He has been
Minister for Education since 1944.
The swearing-in of Heffron as Premier
was the obvious move, but his retention
of the post will depend on the meeting
of caucus today (Wednesday). If he is
elected leader of the Labor party he will
continue in the Premiership ; otherwise
he will have to make way for the new
leader, like Frank Forde in similar cir-
cumstances after the death of John
Curtin in 1945. Heffron’s age —he is
69 —may be a bar to his election. On the
other hand it could be a reason for
choosing him to fill the gap while
younger contenders for the position sort
themselves out.
• •
The only previous instance of a N.S.W.
Premier dying in office was John Storey,
in 1921. Jim Dooley, who had been
Acting Premier during Storey’s absence
early in the year, was sworn-in as
Premier and elected leader of the A.L.P.
a few days later.
• •
Almost before the news that Premier
Cahill had died was abroad in Sydney,
Cabinet-architects were at work replacing
him. About the only combination of
Ministers that seems not to have been
considered was Billy Sheahan as Premier
and Gus Kelly as Minister for Educa-
tion. Most Ministers were considered
“too” something by somebody—Sheahan
too tactless, Heffron too benign, Hills
too inexperienced, Renshaw too taciturn
—and so on.
Reg Downing, possibly the most
promising starter had he been at the
post, was unfortunately marooned in
“another place” and there was no im-
mediate way of bringing him down to
common earth.
• •
When Khrushchev was in Hollywood
they took him to see the filming of “Can
Can.” News-shots showed him grinning
broadly, but he later expressed himself
disgusted. Now he’s going to Paris
President de Gaulle will no doubt give
him the opportunity of being disgusted
at the Folies Bergere.

N.S.W. Opposition - leader Askin’s
censure - motion over Metropolitan
Cement’s overdraft with the Rural Bank
was defeated by 58 votes to 37. Labor,
of course, had the numbers to defeat it
in any case, but when the Country party
announced that it would not support the
motion the debate became an exercise-
only affair, though not without sound
and fury. Askin seemed to detect faint
footprints of Doyle, Arthur and others
in the cement, but little was said in the
debate that had not been said before.
McKerihan’s comment when it was
all over was, “The sooner everybody
lets the Rural Bank carry on its normal
activities like every other bank the
better.” A £4-million overdraft running
on for years and getting bigger all the
time —how normal can you get?
• •
Nobody seems to have been ready to
deny the strongly supported story that
Dr. Evatt would be the next Chief
Justice of New South Wales —not even
the learned doctor himself. But there
are lions in the path. The Communist
leaders of the Miners’ Federation are
believed to be appalled at losing their
favorite politician, even though he has
done little to support them since they
campaigned intensively for his election.
• •
The date of the Summit conference is
still only a matter of guesswork, and
history seems to be repeating itself in
Western Europe, where the selfishness of
France and Germany have been among
the most dynamic forces in world history.
The British favor an early conference
while the atmosphere is right, but the
German and French attitudes are compli-
cated by the Berlin and Algerian prob-
lems.

[From Canberra]
Senator Nancy Buttfield, from South Australia,
has learned the hard way that, male or female,
once you are in politics there are certain
rules to' be observed and if they’re broken
you get slapped smartly. The slaps were
administered in the party-room as a sequel to
Nancy’s disclosing in a newspaper-article what
had happened in the same party-room when
she put-up her proposal for a Senate committee
to inquire into tourism.
Everyone knows that party-room secrets leak
out, but never in anyone’s name. And
particularly so when a barb is added, attack-
ing members of the party for alleged
“wowserism.’’
When the Senate Government parties met
this week, Ted Maher, of Queensland, led a
full-blooded attack oif Mrs. Buttfield, telling
her that in future she must respect confidences.
Nancy left the meeting a very subdued
woman and subsequently in the Senate
apologised for being a bad girl.


Who was the P.M. kidding when he

“most ill - informed” member of Par-
liament on the question of members’
privileges and amenities'? It was he, as
head of the Government sub-committee,

recommendations of the Richardson
Report which contained all the privi-
leges and amenities that members now
enjoy. Anyway, he 1 has called for a
full list so that he and a couple of
senior Ministers can study them to see
which, if any, should be withdrawn.

Tom Hiley, Queensland Treasurer and
Housing Minister, is planning a personal
review of methods used to collect lagging
Housing Commission rents. He told the
Assembly that arrears hovered regularly
around £90,000 and were still tending to
rise. The Treasurer recently roasted
Commissioner Galvin for a toughly-
worded circular sent to tenants, told him
to avoid irritating good tenants, but to
press bad payers hard.

Melbourne’s s.-p. bookies haven’t
given up the ghost on the off-course
tote-bill and are still arguing in the
Spring Street lobbies with anyone who
will listen. The Labor vote in the Legis-
lative Council will be important, so the
harangues have been addressed chiefly
to the A.L.P., but some Labor M.L.C.s
want the bill to go the full distance and
provide for off-course cash-betting.

John Duggan, Queensland Opposition
leader, told the State Trade Union Con-
gress that the days of direct-action and
emotional appeal to workers had vir-
tually passed. He urged delegates to
produce a policy that would be practical,
conform to modern conditions, and be
in accordance with Australian sentiment.
It was the A.L.P.’s duty to establish in
the public mind that Labor could be
trusted and that it was interested in
Australia’s future. Isn’t that what the
Doc. his been trying to do for years?

One aspect of the comparatively
sudden decisions in Sydney and Mel-
bourne to permit lofty city buildings of
20-and-more stories is the concern being
caused to some businesses which, not
long ago, built to the then height-limit

Today, it seems, buildings of twice the
height (and therefore, almost twice the
earning-power) could have been built.

“Stromlo”: As a (fortunately) de-
tached student of Antarctic affairs since
the days of Scott, I await with interest
to see whether the treaty - talks in
Washington pay any attention to Admiral
Byrd’s suggestion of some years ago that
the frozen South should be regarded as
an international refrigerator, where the
world’s food-surpluses could be stored
until the time when they were needed
to supplement the needs of the vastly
larger world-population of a.d.2000 and
thereafter. I’m also waiting to see
whether Australia is prepared to back
its claims to large slices of sovereignty
by providing its own supply- and ex-
ploration-ships, instead of chartering
them, and by running its own Antarctica
air-services instead of appealing on
occasion to the U.S. forces.

Lord Attlee flew into Melbourne and,

“Ceg”: A correspondent in a Mel-
bourne paper asks, with some reason,
“How can compulsory voting be justified
for the electors, when the person elected
to Parliament may abstain from voting
(as he often does) when he is elected?”
There are, of course, various reasons for
such abstention on the part of a member,
including political strategy, or a complete
lack of information in his mind as to the
matter under debate. However, an elector
with similar reasons can be fined unless
he goes along and records a vote. Why
the distinction between electors and
elected?

Although the A.L.P. platform urges
the destruction of all Upper Houses,
many Labor men, including Cahill him-
self, were lukewarm on abolition of the
Legislative Council and were thought to
be going to the referendum with a view
to preserving the Council rather than
abolishing it. An abolitionist will stand
a much stronger chance with some sec-
tions of Caucus as a candidate for the

Water-shortage, S.A.’s ever-recurrent
problem, is never far from Playford’s
mind. At the moment there are two
new proposals under consideration, in
addition to the duplication of the
Morgan-Whyalla pipeline. One is the
enlarging of the Mt. Bold reservoir;
the other a plan to use Lake Bonney,
between Berri and Cobdogla, as a
storage for Murray water, to be piped
8y miles from Lock 4, just downstream
from Berri. The proposal would cost
£5 million, but it would give storage for
13,625-million gallons, which is about
the present capacity of all Adelaide’s
reservoirs.
Playford’s hopes of reaching agree-
ment with N.S.W. to divert some of
the water from the Menindee Lakes
have apparently evaporated.

Figures produced by Premier Bolte
show that wage- and salary-earners in
Victoria increased in the 12 months to
July 31 by 17,900, or 36.9 per cent, of
the Australian total increase, compared
with 26.6 in N.S.W. Victorian unem-
ployment is 1.1 per cent, and the Aus-
tralian average 1.3 p.c. Of all new
buildings under construction in Australia
in the year to March 31 34.8 p.c. were
in Victoria and 32.7 p.c. in N.S.W.;
and of 49,000 houses and flats built in
that time in Australian capitals, 36.1
p.c. were in Melbourne and 35.7 p.c.
in Sydney. These percentage differences
may not seem significant until it is
remembered that Victoria’s population is
only two-thirds that of N.S.W.

[From London]
U.K. Labor reaction to defeat is as pathetic
as it is nonsensical. When asked to account
for their defeat, the reply is always the same:
“We haven’t, convinced the people that we’re
Socialist enough. We’ve tried to play at
capitalists and it won’t work.”
“But the people don’t want Socialism.
They’ve just said so.”
“That’s because they don’t understand it.
It hasn’t been explained to them properly.
It will have to be re-stated ...”
By comparison, Sinbad was unencumbered,
but he did manage ultimately to get rid of
his burden. Mr. Gaitskell will need prodigious
resolution if he is to get rid of his.


Personal
ITEMS
Visiting Australia with the British
delegation to the Commonwealth Par-
liamentary Association’s conference,
Clement Richard, first Earl Attlee, is
perhaps the easiest to recognise of all
the delegates. He looks exactly like his
photographs of 1945-51, when he was
twice British Prime Minister —a little
greyer, perhaps, but otherwise un-
changed.
Born in Putney (London) in 1883, Lord
Attlee was educated at Haileybury
College and went on to Oxford. Called
to the Bar in 1906, he practised in
London for three years, and while there
—from his visits to the Haileybury
Mission in South-east London and from
the friends he made there became
absorbed in Labor economic theory.
Secretary of Toynbee Hall in 1910,
lecturer at Ruskin College in 1911, and
then from 1912 to 1923 tutor and lecturer
at the London School of Economics—
but taking time out from start to finish
of War I, serving with the South Lan-
cashire Regiment and Tank Corps on
Gallipoli and in Mesopotamia and
France, wounded, and ended as a major—
he became first Labor Mayor of Stepney
in 1919 and M.P. for the Limehouse
Division in 1922. Parliamentary Private
Secretary to Ramsay MacDonald (then
Leader of the Opposition) from 1922-24,
he was Under-Secretary for War in the
Labor Government in 1924 and became
Deputy Leader of the Labor party in
1931, graduating to Leader of the Oppo-
sition in 1935.
In War II he was successively Lord
Privy Seal, Secretary of State for the
Dominions and Lord President of the
Council acting loyally and ably as
Winston Churchill’s right-hand man in
the National Government. The debacle
of 1945 brought him to the post of Prime
Minister for two successive terms. He
was raised to the peerage in 1955 and
made a K.G. in 1956.

Lancelot Morton Spiller Hargrave,
chairman of Adelaide’s Festival of Arts
Committee and in his third term as
the city’s Lord Mayor, is the poker-
faced, puckish character known to
Diggers of two world wars as “Gerry”
Hargrave. Now 64, lawyer Hargrave,
who’s been in “everything from croquet
to steeplechasing,” can be safely bet on
to make a success of the festival, which
begins in March next year.
A “steeplechasing Lord Mayor”?
Well, after a bit of tanti vying in
Palestine in War I as a Light Horseman,
Hargrave rode Alan Bowman’s Cullu-
laraine in the Morphettville Hunt Club
Cup. His mount (once a G.N. winner)
had fallen in two previous starts. Says
Hargrave: “I was extremely relieved to
be able to dismount of my own
volition.”
Herewith, David Forrest, 35-year-old
author of a novel (just published by
Heinemann) entitled The Last Blue Sea
—a story of the war in New Guinea,
which won the first Dame Mary Gilmore
Award.
Forrest, down from Brisbane, where
he works in the Commonwealth Savings
Bank, called at The Bulletin the other
day and spoke a little about his book
DAVID FORREST
and how it came to be written. It has
taken him 12 years to finish, he said.
It’s based on his experiences in War 11,
when he was a member of the 58th/59th
Battalion’s Intelligence-section. Twenty-
one when he came home from the war,
he gained a very vivid impression of
the fighting, and from his post in
Intelligence where. more than is
possible for ordinary infantrymen, he
could see what was happening on the
flanks, and to a certain degree at higher
h.-q.s—he got a general picture of the
whole operation he uses as a background
to- the character-studies he has drawn.
He stresses that the book is a novel,
not a war-history.
This is his first book, though Forrest
has had a number of short-stories pub-
lished before. He valued his time in the
A.I.F. and after the war remained in
the C.M.F. until 1953, working with
Intelligence at Northern Command h.-q.
To give him some more of his due:
Jack Davey (farewelled by a colleague
in these pages last week) had built
a reputation as a crooner in his native
New Zealand before he first came to
Sydney in 1934. He made his way into
2GB and also started singing at 2BL
before he set about revolutionising
radio-announcing in Austialia. From
then on he broadcast from 2GB and
other Macquarie-n.etwork stations almost
continuously, except when he was serv-
ing with the American Red Cross as a
field-entertainer during the war. Having
landed in Australia with £1 in his pocket,
he ended his life the highest-paid radio-
entertainer in the Commonwealth.
Immensely popular, known in almost
every home, he was also greatly respected
because of his kindness, which showed
itself not only in his treatment of shy
quiz-contestants but also in less-pub-
licised acts of general humanity ; and
he was admired, too, for his gameness.

Whenever Denis Warner makes a
call at The Bulletin office, talk gets
round sooner or later to deployment-
maps. He came in the other day, back
from visiting 10 countries in South-east
Asia and the Far East, with very little
good to say for the accuracy of some
situation-maps he had been shown on
his travels. Although just recovering
from a spot of sickness, he was looking
his usual vigorous self. He’s gone to
Melbourne now to put the impressions
of his last tour on paper, but he’s itching
to go abroad again as soon as that’s done.

“Bass”: Veteran prospector James
Edmund Tregurtha, who had sought gold
over most of Australia, New Guinea and
the Yukon, passed on at 92 at Perth’s
Military Hospital, and somewhere along the
track he's bound to strike an old mate with a
waterbag and an urge to repay a past favor.
A New South Welshman from Deniliquin, he
learnt blacksmithing in Victoria, but soon found
himself looking for gold in Queensland. From
there he prospected with some success through
nor'-Westralia, moved across to S.A., went
north a little, and with a couple of mates left
Oodnadatta and headed through the desert
country on a line that brought them out a
couple of hundred miles north of Kalgoorlie.
That dry stretch probably decided him to try
his luck in New Guinea, and soon after that
the Yukon rush of ’9B took him up near the
Arctic. In less than a year he was back in
Westralia, and had his share of luck. He was
one of the first white men in the Petermann
Ranges country; and he was adamant that
Lasseter’s Reef was a myth.

The gardens and bushland round the
home of O. M. (“Mack”) Falkiner,
M.L.C., at Newport Heights, Sydney,
500 ft. above sea-level, are as near to a
summit as you would find around
Sydney. And the refreshingly informal


atmosphere and discussions at a
luncheon given there to visiting Com-
monwealth Parliamentarians suggested
that the site could be most suitable for
official meetings of a “summit” nature.
World problems assumed reasonable and
surmountable proportions to delegates,
here for the Commonwealth Parliamen-
tary Association meetings, as they basked
in the spring sunshine and sipped our
national amber beverage.
Delegates from Malaya, Ghana,
Nigeria, Northern Ireland, Canada,
Aden and elsewhere, together with
observers from the United States,
mingled like members of one family.
Talk was on topics like “Our voting
system is better than yours.” No guarded
words, no prepared statements, each man
proud of his own system ; but prepared
to acknowledge points in favor of others.
A delegate from Ghana joins a group.
He is lightly accused of having an in-
feriority complex for saying that his
is only a “small” nation of six million.
“Only four million less than Australia,”
he’s told. He counters: “Australia likes
to think it is an important nation. It
will be, but not for many years.” We
pour him a beer.
The' robust Whip of the Nigerian
Government, his blue-and-white striped
garments blending beautifully with his
rich chocolate skin, rejoices that the
steak-and-kidney is just as his wife
would make it. The Duke of Abercorn,
from Northern Ireland, laughs heartily
over this new common-denominator—
the Queen, democracy, and steak-and-
DUKE OF ABERCORN
kidney. A Bulletin rep. lightning-
sketches him as he laughs..
Bill Wentworth, M.H.R., arrives and
is quickly introduced to an Indian, the
only Communist delegate present —but
no one tells Bill this till after the
delegates have parted. Anyway, such was
the atmosphere on this Sydney summit
that even these two may have found
much in common.
As has been noted before, present writer’s
rate of advance since joining The Bulletin
tends to increase to two dukes an hour.
Earlier in the year, just before going to inter-
view Argyll, the office-door opened and
H. P. (“Duke”) Tritton came in. A few days
ago “Duke” had just called again for a yarn
when Bill Prior entered with the sketch he’d
made of James Edward Hamilton, fourth Duke
of Abercorn. Keeping the theme in the purple,
“Duke” Tritton is celebrating his golden-
wedding on November 28, and hopes his book
Time Means Tucker will be out about the
same date, or close to it: so is The Bulletin
—it’s publishing “Duke’s” book.

“8.P.M.”: It is given to some to excel
in the calling they have chosen, but few
have combined with this eminence a
complete humility and understanding of
their fellow-men: Jack Shand was one
of the few. To those on his own side
of the legal profession he was known
to all, and, of more significance, he
knew all of us. Impish in expression
and happy in nature, when work was
put aside he played with the same
enthusiasm he bestowed upon his work.
He excelled at both, but never mixed
the one with the other. There will be
few of his former colleagues who have
not at some time felt the warmth of his
generous and kindly nature. It may have
been at the time of some personal need
or perhaps congratulations on some
forensic victory, sincerely given as by
an equal to an equal and never more
sincere than when this eminent counsel
was himself the vanquished. No col-
league ever worked with or against Jack
Shand without learning much —and to
the discerning the lesson went far beyond
the art of law. We will always remem-
ber him for many qualities that showed
him as a great counsel and a great man.
But to all of us no quality will be
remembered better than his passionate
love of justice—and his determination
that it should prevail for those whose
means or circumstances did not permit
them to pursue it. This quality will be
his monument to the Bar, and so long
as there are those who will see it the
Bar will never cease to give its best
service to the community.

New general-finance-manager of Aus-

ABORIGINALITIES
SAWDUSTS
r T''HE by-product of timber is no longer
the fiiiing-heap at the municipal tip or
the heaps smouldering outside sawmills.
There is ebony sawdust which, mixed
with blood, composes bois-durci medall-
ions ; there are mahogany “fines” that
impart the right sheen to mink and
chinchilla furs, and even down to the
carpeting of your local butcher’s shop
there is a ramification of peculiar re-
quirements to be met by the sawdust-
merchant.
That which catches the spilt gravy on
the busy cafe’s kitchen-floor can be just
hardwood, but the smart neon-lit meatery
buys a light-colored pine, preferably of
a sharp resin scent. It must not be too
fine and dry, or it will float up to the
displayed joints.
Premium .prices are paid for smoking-
sawdust by the ham- and fish-curers. In
the Old Dart it’s oak, in the U.S. hickory,
in Australia it was New Zealand kauri,
but supplies failed and our curers now
burn hemlock, which is dry and impor-
tantly innocent of pitch or resin. The do-
it-yourself farmer swears by redgum for
his smokehouse, but he makes his own
when sawing dry firewood.
Rumbling (or polishing) inside a
revolving box calls in the silverware-trade
for sawdust free from tannic-acid or
acetic-acid, but clothes-pegs or tooth-
picks are rumbled with any dry species
with a little wax added. When the circus
comes to town this is a bulk order at a
cut rate for a very old customer, who will
be very vocal if any jarrah or red-pine is
included, because that shows badly on
the cream ponies and the bareback riders’
tu-tus.
Large quantities of sawdust are called-
for suddenly to keep paper-bagged
fertiliser and lime off rain-wet floors of
railway-trucks. Growers of azaleas and
rhododendrons want only hardwood saw-
dust, and W.A. karri is tops for these
acid-loving ericaceae.
A discriminating utilisation is in the
manufacture of plastics, and here is
specified not only the sawdust color and
moisture-content but its degree of fine-
ness by mesh-count.
Omitting 9500 country butchers who
get their own from the local sawmill,
the Australian sawdust-business totals
yearly 1,150,000 bags at from Is. 6d. to
12s. 6d. a bag.

“Sear” (N.Z.): Down they hurtled,
with a sound like ripping cloth, wings
half-closed, heads and necks straight,
webbed feet plastered against grey
feathers: much too fast to make the
approach into the tree-lined Ongarue
River. Then into a sizzling turn and
round in a wide sweep, till enough pace
was lost to enable them to dive steeply
down and cut three brief frothy wakes
in the darkly flowing water. Three grey
duck —the old triangle again—a picture
of streamlined grace put to precision-
work. Watching them in action you’d
say that their technique was the model
"Parly-voo fronsee ?”
for the first landing-on-a-flightdeck
operation.
“Brick E”: The brickie was a weather-
beaten old-timer who used to call his
plumb-rule “Sarah.” I asked him how
came the name. “That’s my missus’s
name,” he told me. I still didn’t get it.
“Well,” he grinned, “I build a corner up,
sight down it, and reckon she’s dead
plumb. Then I put Sarah on it to check
it. And the old bitch has never agreed
with me in forty years!”

“Judee” : You wouldn’t find many
horse-troughs in a day’s march through
Sydney’s suburbs ; but it’s different in
the State's second city—Greater New-
castle Council employs a man who’s
mainly occupied in cleaning and repair-
ing troughs. Breadcarters’ horses are
the chief imbibers. One trough at Walls-
end was repaired recently because
members of a riding-school watered their
mounts there.

“The Hat”: Having decided to clinch
a deal on the sale of a flock of his ewes,
a distant neighbor in a Riverina (N.S.W.)
town phoned a telegram through to the
city agent. It simply said: “Can supply
ewes.” The boy at the post-office pain-
fully spelt this out and said: “Yeah, but

“O’Johnno”: Tasmanian bees have
seemingly been adopting go-slow tactics
over the past year, during which 190 bee-
keepers had a total of 6331 hives operat-
ing ; of these 4775 yielded 341,565 lb.
of honey, against a 29 per cent, higher
figure for the previous year, when there
were 132 fewer hives. Average yield of
each hive was 71.5 lb., compared with
108.3 lb. the year before. Presumably no
action will be taken against the defaulters
unless proof is forthcoming that poor
blossom and not an inexplicable lapse on
the part of formerly trusted and
industrious workers is to blame.

“Crow Eater”: I remember the
embossed jars (B. 23/9/’59) carrying the
name of the Standard Salt Co., in S.A.
At that time Yorke Peninsula salt was
scraped from the scores of lagoons at
the lower part of the Peninsula, carted
by horse-teams to Edithburg’s several
refineries, and shipped to pretty well all
parts of Australia as well as to New
Zealand. Sailing-ships and ketches were

still in action then, and the three-masters
could frequently be seen loading, as well
as steamers like the old Time and Age.
The Standard was one of the companies
operating at Edithburg ; the Castle and
the Federal were also working. In the
early days of the century the industry
provided work for hundreds of men, as
well as a tidy sum for farmers who
either worked or let the lagoons on their
property. One of the biggest lakes was
Lake Fowler, near Yorketown, about
16 miles round ; another was Pink Lake,
covered with sparkling pink-tinted
crystals. When I was last over that
way, about two years back, the industry
was very quiet, and where any scraping
“Scared of sunburn, Mary ?”
was being done mechanisation had
replaced the old hand-pushed scrapers
and ploughs.

“Alawa” (N.Q.): The bonds of
matrimony were strained at our wharf-
laborers’ picnic. At the start of the foot-
race for the wharfies’ wives it was noticed
that a black gin had lined-up. When it
was gently explained that she couldn’t
start because she wasn’t married to a
wharfie she became very indignant.
“Married! Me not married to a
wharfie! ” she screamed. “I’m married to
more blutty wharfies than anyone here.”

“Fuzzy Wuzzy”: Better prices for
copra and coconut-oil and a major rise
in exports of coffee and cocoa sent the
Papua and New Guinea export-revenue
in 1958-59 soaring to a new record total
of more than £l6| million, an increase
of more than 31 per cent. Copra and
other coconut-products top the list with
nearly £9 million, and cocoa, with nearly
£li million, is ahead of both plywood
and rubber. Gold exports were down to

totalled 4253 tons, compared with 639

duction in the next few years.

“Cunedda”: In the general-informa-
tion section of Pears Cyclopaedia (1932
edition) is an item on the origin of the
word “Never-Never” (B. 30/9/’59):
Never-Never Land is a name that is now
frequently given to the seemingly illimit-
able plains of northern Australia. Who
coined the phrase is not known, but it was
first uttered on a London stage by Sir H.
Beerbohm Tree in the character of “Captain
Swift,” the gentlemanly Australian bush-
ranger. The late Wilson Barrett used it
as the title' for both a play and a novel.
It is also prominently used in Sir J. M.
Barrie’s Christmas play, “Peter Pan.” In
the early ’Bo’s of last century, a book
appeared with the title of The Never-Never
Land: A Ride Through Northern Queens-
land.

“Pigskin Bagman”: Webster's (accord-
ing to “New Recordings,” B. 16/9/’59)
defines “combos” as “the universe con-
ceived as an orderly and harmonious
system.” To the old-time bushman the
term referred to white men married to
or living with lubras. Maybe there was
something in it, after all." It can’t be
forgotten, though, that the term or title
was proudly carried by Frederick Ward,
otherwise Thunderbolt. In fact, so
highly did he rate the appellation that
he bestowed it on what must have been
one of the greatest bush horses ever to
look through, a bridle. Thunderbolt’s
Gap and Combo’s Leap are two spots
I have seen over which this super animal
carried his lawless rider, and no ordi-
nary horse could have done either.
* * * *
“Archaen”: For spelling aboriginal
and other native words anthropologists
have had to devise new signs for con-
sonants. One is “n” with the tail of a “g”
added to represent the combination of
those two letters used by our aborigines
and by Polynesians at the start of many
words, such as ngama and Ngaio.
Another is a special sign to represent
the glottal stop, which is more than a
dropped letter ; it is a sound which can
be described only as a catch in the breath.
Special type has to be used by printers,
of course, when setting-up scientific
papers dealing with anthropological
subjects. Strangest of all is the exclama-
tion-mark before proper names in the
language used by the Bushmen of Africa.
Their name for themselves is printed
!Kung, and the exclamation-mark stands
for a peculiar explosive click which they
give before pronouncing this and similar
names.

'Two mysterious denizens of uncertain
species which supposedly still inhabit
southern waters have from time to time
been seen and even believed.
One reputedly disports in the 50-
square-mile sheet of water in Tasmania’s
Central Highlands. Its first appearance
was as far back as 1863, when one
Charles Hedlam reported having seen it.
A number of others have sighted it since,
and one feature on which all agree is that
it carries a large projecting fin behind
the head. A man named Slater saw the
“bunyip” in 1914 while fishing ; it was
only a few yards from the shore and he
got a close-up view of the fin, which
was about 1 Sin. behind the snout, rigid
like a shark’s dorsal-fin, and dead-black
in color. A student of Tasmanian natural
history, he was convinced that the
creature was not listed among any of
the island’s fauna.
In 1932 a noted Tasmanian naturalist
publicly declared that the data collected
undoubtedly showed there was an animal
in the lake possessing well-developed
swimming-powers. There is a possibility
that it may be a seal; but the Great Lake
is a long way from the sea, necessitating
an up-river journey of hundreds of miles.
The lake-denizen must be nearing the
century-age mark by now.
The other one that is still await-
ing identification is the “Monster of
Southern Cross Reef,” in Bass Strait. It
has been seen on several occasions by
fishermen and others, who say it travels
beneath the water with some sort of
appendage on its back, which it pushes up
two or three feet above the surface and
moves in spiral gyrations. It may be
related to the ray-family; but those
who’ve seen it at close range can’t place
it among pictures or descriptions which
have been shown to them.

CHARGING INTEREST ON TAXES
'"There appears to be no doubt
at all that when Treasurer
Holt, in his Budget-speech,
remarked that “there is room
for difference of opinion as
to what the true capitalisation
of the Post Office should be
in accounting terms” - after
mentioning that “the Govern-
ment” had provided some
£4OO million (out of revenue)
for new Post Office buildings
and equipment since 1945 —he
had in mind charging the Post
Office accounts with an arbi-
trary rate of interest which
would be recoverable from
Post Office revenue.
In a letter to The Bulletin,
published on October 7, M. R.
C. Stradwick, Director-General,
Postmaster-General’s Depart-
ment, said: “During the past
five years Post Office capital-
expenditure has totalled close
on £2OO million. These funds
have been provided from Con-
solidated Revenue, and the
Government has decided that it
would be fair to expect charges
to telephone-users not only to
recoup operating- and main-
tenance-costs but also to ensure
a reasonable return on new
capital used.”
From that it would appear
that “the Government has de-
cided” already although
Treasurer Harold Holt as late
as August 11 said “we have
recently decided to appoint a
committee of competent out-
side people to study and report”
on this matter.
If the Government has
already received the report of
the committee which it has
“recently” appointed in order
to make its decision “to ensure
a reasonable return on new
capital used,” then the com-
mittee must have acted with
an alacrity hitherto unknown
in Canberra circles.
It is not being suggested here
that the Treasury, in levying
an interest-charge on revenue
spent on Post Office capital-
works, would make Mr. Strad-
wick’s task as Director-
General of Posts and Tele-
graphs any easier. It would
make it more difficult. The
Bulletin’s concern here is one
of high economics its con-
tention in this matter is that
to charge interest on money
spent from revenue on capital-
works would be a betrayal by
the Government of the prin-
ciple on which the money was
originally raised and spent and
of the objective which it was
intended to achieve.
This matter of capital-
expenditure out of revenue
goes far beyond the problems
of the Post Office. Post Office
finances represent only one of
the manifestations of a long
period in which revenue has
been applied towards payment
for capital-works. While it may
have been the recipient of the
largest allocation of revenue
for works, at around £4OO
million since 1949, the fact is
that something like £l5OO
million has been spent on
various works out of revenue
over the past decade.
Since 1950-51 the Budget
surpluses applied towards State
works-programmes and debt-
redemption (apart from statu-
tory provisions under the
sinking-fund arrangements),
and the annual Commonwealth
capital-works outlay out of
revenue, are shown in this
table: —-
Capital
Outlay
Budget From
Surplus Revenue
(£mil.) (£mil.)
1950- .. .. 7.0 31.8
1951- .. .. 98.5 110.6
1952- .. .. 13.4 103.6
1953- .. .. 56.3 94.1
1954- .. .. 70.1 95.7
1955- .. .. 61.6 101.9

1957- .. .. 104.4 123.5
1958- .. .. -9.3 132.3
513.6 901.3
For the current year no
Budget surplus is anticipated,
but the appropriation for
capital-works out of revenue
is put at £142 million. Of this,
£35 million is earmarked for
War Service Homes, £25
million for the Snowy Moun-
tains Authority, and £39
million for the Post Office.
This method of financing
public works during the par-
ticular period to which it has
applied has had, in an opinion
long held and published by
The Bulletin, the advantages
(a) of supplying money for
public works when it could
have been obtained otherwise
only at excessive rates of
interest or by the inflationary
use of bank-credit; and ( b ) of
taking spending-power out of
“So that’s why you wanted a lock of my hair!
the pockets of the people
during a period in which too
much money was, notoriously,
chasing too few goods.
It tended, also, to offset the
expenditure on the waste of
war (1939-45) that had been
financed out of public loans
and Treasury bills.
Furthermore, in a period in
which the economic waste of
current defence-expenditure
averages around £l9O million
a year, it tended to establish,
out of revenue, assets of
civilian worth roughly equal to
the large sums which each
year disappeared from civilian
ken behind the curtain of the
defence departments.
Notwithstanding, the anti-
inflationary effects of this
Commonwealth Budgetary
policy, the cost-of-living index
in Australia increased from
1415 in 1949 to 3019 this year.
This means that in the decade
during which £l5OO million was
spent out of revenue on
capital-works the cost-of-
living more than doubled. In
The Bulletin’s opinion, if the
capital-works outlay had been
financed by other means infla-
tion would have been greater
still.
The crux o£ the argument
against now charging the
departments concerned wrth
lnt “? s ! on th ? f , re . ve ”“
pended as capital is that the
interest-charge would un-
doubtedly be passed-on to the
public in increased charges for
services rendered, and this
would add to the cost-of-living
and the inflationary spiral

Such an action, promoted by
the Treasury, would seem to
be economically irresponsible
from the point of view of the
national struggle against in-
flation.
It would tend, also, to make
the national Budget an expan-
sionary one by bringing more
funds into the control of the
Treasury ; and the more money
that flows in that direction the
more expansionist the Can-
berra empire- builders appear
to become.
Governments and Govern-
ment departments create little
in the way of goods or services
(the Post Office is an excep-
tion), and almost never create
capital. An expansionist
policy in Canberra at a rate
beyond that of the produc-
tive section of the Australian
economy is a danger-signal to
be heeded by all.
Workers’ Cash Orders
A lush little business is The
Workers’ Cash Order and
Finance Co., Ltd., with its
registered office in Sydney but
with branches at Newcastle,
Maitland and Wollongong, and
agencies at Cessnock and
Singleton (N.S.W.). Whether
“the workers” have supplied
the capital, or whether they
just avail themselves of the
finance, isn’t clear, but the
distinction could be important.
Paid capital is £lOO,OOO in
1000 founders’ shares of 10s.
each and 99,500 ords. of 10s.
each. Reserves at June 30 last
aggregated £l69,4l3—share-
premiums £56,959, undistri-
buted profits £112,454.
On these funds, after pro-
viding for undisclosed taxation,
the co. last term showed net
profits of £39,267, equal to
39.3 p.c. flat on total capital.
But after the ords. are paid
their first 10 p.c. the founders’
dividends are calculated on the
basis of a quarter of the
remaining profit, plus whatever
is paid on the ords. over 10 p.c.
For 1958-59 the ords. were
paid a final div. of 20 p.c. ; so
the founders’ whack worked-
out at one-fourth of £29,317
( = £7329), plus 20 p.c. on £5OO
( = £100), the total being £7429.
This represents 1486 per cent,
on the founders’ capital of
£500!
Still, the ords. have no com-
plaint. They got their 30 p.c.,
even though only £l9BB of the
year’s profit was left to be
visibly carried forward.
The word “visibly” is empha-
sised because, with taxation
provision not disclosed, and
with depreciation allowance of
£1674 for the year on fixed
assets which, after the pro-
vision, had a book-value of £6
(motor-vehicles, £3, furniture
and fittings, £3), it would
appear that profits to begin
with are very conservatively
stated.
On top of this, it is men-
tioned by the auditor that
“profits of the subsidiary com-
pany have not been taken into
account in arriving at the
profits as disclosed in the
accounts.”
The subsidiary appears in
the books as shares “at cost,
less provision,” £20,000. What
this subsidiary does is not
completely evident, but if it is a
chip off the old block it could
be a fine repository for inner
reserves.
The parent has other invest-
ments shown “at cost, less
provision,” at £45,000. Sundry
debtors, also less provision,
appear at £377,026, advance to
subsidiary at £1725, and bank-
balance at £30,216.
Sundry creditors, tax-pro-
vision and divs. payable total
£204,560, on the liabilities side.
The directors are cheerful in
the annual report, if not
particularly specific. They say
that the co. has had another
successful trading-year, and
looks forward to a further
good one. It is in a sound
position, and the board is
giving attention to changing
conditions.
On Sydney ’Change, in
the unlisted section, buyers
hopefully offer 30s. for the 10s.
ords. without attracting sellers.
The shares would seem to be
worth waiting for at that price,
whether you are a worker or
not.
On the board of The
Workers’ Cash Order and
Finance Co., Ltd., are John
Lamb (chairman), S. P. P.

tary), H. Lamb and Lawford

Housing Finance
[From tlie presidential address by
K. J. Hedley, F.F.A., to the
Actuarial Society of Australasia]
TJecause of the attributes of
other types of investments
—the very high rates of interest
available on debentures and
notes, the taxation concessions
and minimum expense associ-
ated with ownership of Gov-
ernment securities, and the
practical freedom from taxa-
tion of dividend income re-
ceived by resident companies
—home-purchase loans of
themselves are not attractive to
an institutional investor such
as a life-office unless (a) the
rate of interest charged is high
from the borrower’s point of
view; and ( b ) there are other
advantages in that life-insur-
ance to cover the debt can be
required as a condition, as well
as the fire-insurance on the
property.
The comparison with other
forms of investment is a very
real one, yet the apparently
onerous nature of (a) and ( b )
can be a source of future diffi-
culty and public distrust.
The attempt to treat indi-
vidual home-purchase loans as
commercial loans, impose
restrictions on rights of repay-
ment (perhaps charging a
substantial penalty where re-
payment is sought before ex-
piry of the full term) and
generally to take advantage of
present circumstances in im-
posing conditions could create
a store of trouble.
The whole question of hous-
ing finance in Australia is a
most difficult one. Unfortu-
nately specialised institutions
of the status and character of
those of many other Western
economies are lacking.

reasons for this failure to de-
velop adequate organisations
for housing finance? There is
a need for clear thinking in
the analysis and assessment of
published statistics, and also
for freedom from political or
institutional bias in a thorough
investigation into the nature of
lenders in this field, the sources
of their funds, and the terms
of loans.
It is generally recognised
that in “good” times other
avenues of investment are more
profitable to lenders the in-
dividual home-buyer cannot
then afford the interest-rate
that commercial businesses can
pay. Within a few years we
have seen a tremendous change
in Australia ten years ago
many life- and general-insur-
ance companies were lending
to terminating building-
societies at 31 p.c. p.a. calcu-
lated on the daily balance. In
this particular field of long-
term finance, long-term stabil-
ity is also required, and it
seems essential that this be pro-
vided by some form of statu-
tory intervention,
How can a change be made?
Can specialised institutions, far
stronger than those that exist
today, be created in our
country in a permanent form?
Can their development lead to
the elimination of unduly
onerous conditions, and such
abuses as those associated with
the provision of temporary
finance to approved ex-service-
men borrowers awaiting their
turn to draw war-service loans?
Is anything possible in the par-
ticular Constitutional situation
of this country, or does the
existence of competing
sovereignties make it too easy
for all to avoid entanglement?
Would a Federal system of in-
suring loans along the lines of
the U.S. Federal Housing Ad-
ministration serve a purpose,
and inter alia enable the estab-
lishment of some control over
the terms of loans of the
organisations insured by it?
N.Z. Import-licensing
AA'ajor changes in N.Z. im-
A port-licensing system were
announced by the Minister of
Customs, Mr. Boord, when he
released the 1960 Import
Licensing Schedule.
The principal new features
of the system are:
t (a) Provision for an “R” or
“replacement-licence” scheme
designed to permit an im-
porter to get all his genuine
import-requirements of an
item (up to a ceiling of 150
per cent, of the value of his
1959 licences) while avoiding
the issue of licences which may
not be used, but which, by
their very existence as a
potential charge on overseas
funds, tie-up exchange which
could otherwise be allotted
elsewhere. The “R” licences
will apply to 109 items, about
30 per cent, of all imports.
( b) Provision for new im-
porters to obtain licences for
goods in the “R” category.
(c) Provision for a system
of “industry groups” whereby
an importer may use a licence
entitlement to import any item
within a specified group, rather
than only to import the par-
ticular items for which the
entitlement was originally
issued.
( d) Exemption from licens-
ing of a number of items
representing a considerable
amount in import-value. They
are: Raw sugar, crude oil,
motor-spirits, certain bulk oils,
explosives, crude sulphur in
bulk, and manures.
(e) Reintroduction in a new
form of “token licence” pro-
vision. Over a wide range of
items for which no other allo-
cation is provided, token
licences will be available for
imports from any source to the
extent of 10 p.c. of the value
of 1956 imports of the same
goods. In a few cases, token
licences will be on the basis
of 100 per cent, of the value
of 1956 licences.
Migrating Oil
£1- rom L. Owen]
A Brisbane correspondent
asks why I stated (B.
30/9 / ’59) that the Puri oil
“had obviously migrated from
a considerable depth” when I
had already asserted (B.
25/2/’59) that “that passage
may quite possibly have been
in a lateral direction.”
My correspondent adds:
I am not trying to trip you up,
but only want to know why you
now consider the migration from
depth.
In a subsequent letter, he
asks: —
If this [migration from depth] is
so, then wouldn’t a further bore
on the Puri structure be a waste
of time unless it is carried down
to a “considerable” depth?
First of all, I would point
out that—as soon as data with
reference to the chemical and
physical characteristics of the
Puri oil were released —it was
obvious to me that it had been
subjected to long - distance
migration from depth to reach
the limestone in which it was
encountered. This deduction
was confirmed when the age of
the limestone was given as
Miocene.
11l the B. 25/2/’59 article
I was dealing with a specific
aspect —that of the oncoming
of light crude after “wet” gas
when the well was acidised.
Here, a further migration was
indicated, this time within the
limestone and laterally. The
two conceptions are comple-
mentary, and are in no wise
contradictory.
It is a fact, recognised by
all geologists with field ex-
perience of migrated oils, that
most of the paths which such
oils have followed have both
vertical and horizontal com-
ponents. It is, therefore, an
integral part of the search for
the reservoirs from which the
petroleum originated to trace —'
by every means available—the
probable paths taken before
deciding on the location of
further deep (or, for that
matter, shallow) wells in the
area in w'hich migrated oil has
been encountered.
That answers the question
asked in the second letter.

“Hey Diddle Diddle”
Apart from scattered pas-
sages of vivid individual style
and fun, the new revue at
Sydney’s Phillip Street Theatre
contains little of the stuff that
long runs are usually made of.
Here and there it throws
broad fun at such promising
butts as civic receptions to
royalty ; the more pretentious
aspects of Wine Week ; housie
drives ; health studios ; tele-
vision-quizzes and beatniks ;
but the writing in these
sketches is seldom strong
enough in verbal or musical
wit to make a telling point.
Attempts have been made
to offset this basic lack of
local brightness with essays in
prettiness and whimsy and a
couple of digressions into wow-
ending sentimentality, some of
which just don’t seem to
belong like occasional
draughts of soft-drink in a
session of plain beer.
The company served this un-
even fare with varying degrees
of success. Gordon Chater
dealt energetically with most of
the material allotted him, often
managing to disguise weak
lines with his own considerable
personality; but most of his
solos—the hare-brained party-
rounder ; the perfume-fancying
navvy; the Madison Avenue
Yank telling Australia all about
itself; the pathetic little
migrant at Mascot; and the
raucous old barmaid were
too weakly developed to
respond.
With a fascinating mixture
of conviction, grotesquerie and
sheer craft, Lyle O’Hara was
easily most successful. Time
and again—as an eagerly
neurotic woman imploring a
terrified doctor for the treat-
ment ; an English girl who has
migrated to Melbourne to see
“My Fair Lady”; a plant-
fancier overwhelmed by a pro-
liferating bush from Mars;
a housie fanatic ruffled by
cackling amateurs; and as
Dollie Dyer in an otherwise
poorly imagined burlesque on
“Pick-a-Box” she almost
convinced us that what we
were seeing was, after all, first-
rate revue.
Jill Perryman worked with
charm, judgment and spirit in
song and dance, but was less
impressive in her spoken
appearances.
Judi Farr, a newcomer to
Phillip Street, is something of
a find. Her social editress in
the civic-reception lampoon
and her beatnik Cinderella who
thought the palace ball was for
squares indicated that she is
capable of much more than
was asked of her here. Un-
fortunately she was given one
of the early soft-drinks to
serve —a typist’s soulful mono-
logue about her babbit-knight
boss, written by Joyce Gren-
fell in one of her more
“literary” moods.
The others of the company—
Robina Beard, Bob Ainslie,
Kevan Johnston (when not
dancing) and Edward Lans-
downe —were seldom able to
impart either a personal lustre
or a bold outline to their
material.

“Oriental Cavalcade”
Freddy Sales doesn’t just
stand around a microphone at
Sydney Tivoli telling blue
stories. He has a wonderful
act as a baby who bashes a
tin dish out of his playground
“with a spoon” ; another as a
ballet-dancer eating fish-and-
chips; and in another—with
Billy Rayes as a Gestapo
officer and an American
, officer respectively—Sales is an
English spy in Germany and
an American soldier a.-w.-l. in
China respectively.
Rayes is a bit outclassed ; his
acting is better than his
comedy. But he does a remark-
able likeness of Maurice
Chevalier.
Next-funniest show on the
bill is the Kawashima dancers,
all wearing heads of baby dolls,
burlesquing “Swan Lake.”
These pretty little Japanese
girls have only their quaintness
to differentiate them from
official Tivoli girls in their
other appearances, but in the
Tschaikowsky parody they are
superb.
Juggler Che Chung Chong
presents the novelty of his girl-
assistant, Mana Koon, being
as good as he is. They balance
balls on balls on the ends of
sticks ; then she balances two
trays, one on top of the other,
on a stick, and knocks the top
tray away with another stick
so that the eggs on the top
tray fall into glasses on the
bottom tray.
The male Sylvano held the
female Sylvano while she
twisted and slid around with
hardly any clothes on in the
moonlight in India. And in
case you got tired of watching
them, there were lovely girls
like statues holding-up the
stand the Sylvanos were per-
forming on the same girls
who, in the opening of the
second part, made such human-
all-too-human bronze figures in
the Mysterious Golden Temple
of Siam.
Next we were in a clearing in
the jungles of Malaya, where
Fred Santos gave a working-
over to Evelyn the Python and
Dawn the Cobra ; after which
a dragon the height of the
proscenium-arch moved up to
the footlights, opened its mouth,
and there was Mikey the
Monster Girl going into her
contortions.
After such wonders no one
could be surprised by Joe
Balangue playing a mouth-
organ with his nose, or three
mouth-organs together with
nose and mouth, horizontally
and vertically ; or by the Philip-
pines trio, soloist and guitarist;
or by the tiny Ricman Duo,
who just sang; or by Billy
McMahon, who tap-danced;
or by the Rudas dancers turn-
ing somersaults on sticks; or
by the Tivoli ballet, which,
though cut in half, was nice
enough for both halves.

“Waltz of the Toreadors”
A strange title for a play-
wright to clap on to a near-
farce about an ageing French
general reaping the bitter
harvest of his youthful wild-
oats! The shock-tactics title
is taken from a dance per-
formed at a military ball
during which the general, as
a young man, fell in love with
his partner. (His wife, it is
later revealed, also chose a
lover in the course of the same
dance. A pity, then, that the
music of John Hotchkis
didn’t suggest the amazing
aphrodisiacal powers the waltz
must have had.)
Nor is the title the only
shock in the piece. The old
general, suspecting the family
doctor of being his wife’s lover,
challenges him to a duel. The
doctor insists, professionally,
that the general is in no condi-
tion to fight a duel, and they
compare stomach-muscles to
emphasise the general’s lack of
condition. At this moment
enters the general’s long-lost
dancing-partner, and both men
are caught, literally, with their
trousers down. (An elderly
lady sitting next to me prac-
tically required medical atten-
tion to restore her!)
An Anouilh play is never,
fortunately, a piece of one
mood. When the general's
wife breaks her pretence of
bedridden ill-health, revealing
it as a device to keep him at her
beck and call, both characters,
as well as the play, suddenly
take on a new dimension, and
it was in this portrayal of
underlying feelings that Brian
Cannon and Jean Seib gave
their best performances.
Ray Dunlop’s Brisbane pro-
duction had much to commend
it —excellent sets and costumes,
for example—but the problems
of the Gallic style defeated
many of the cast, and speech
that should have had spring
in it, assurance and rapier-like
lash was often insecure and
laconic.

illegitimate son of the general,

Josef Krips in Brisbane
Viennese by birth and train-
ing, Josef Krips is far from
being an exponent of the
sugary side of Viennese musi-
cal life. He played to his
Brisbane audiences programmes
of music written, for the most
part, in or around Austria, but
with such power and authority
that the absence of novelties
of any kind was hardly noticed.
With Jan Panenka, bor-
rowed from the Czech Phil-
harmonic as piano soloist, he
produced lovely playing from
the Queensland Orchestra in
Mozart’s D Minor Concerto,
a blend of the delicacy and
masculinity that Mozart
demands without always get-
ting. It was a perfectly-
balanced accompaniment to
Panenka’s poetic account of
the solo part.
Beethoven’s “Eroica” Sym-
phony was not written for an
enormous orchestra, and has
no great batteries of brass in
spite of its heroic proportions.
Yet it needs tremendous drive,
and a kind of sonority of tone
that can only come from the
whole orchestra playing as one
man. Krips seemed to have
no trouble finding the vast
resources of sound he wanted,
and the slow movement was
funeral - music that never
became dreary of spirit, but
was, rather, a passionate elegy.
Another programme had
lighter things, particularly a
Mozart serenade in which
Viennese geniality really was
needed to save an innocent
little piece of “incidental”
music from seeming to be
crushed by the terrible for-
mality of the concert-hall.
There was also Elgar’s “Enigma
Variations” to show that one
doesn’t need to be English to
make them sound well, and a
princely-toned “Mastersingers”
Overture played with a swag-
gering confidence of attack.
All this came hard before
the visit of the Czechs, and had
“Oh, no—not rabbit again!"
a tension not noticeable before.
Obviously the players were on
their mettle, and although the
splendor of the touring
orchestra just over the hill did
something to slacken public
interest in these concerts,
Krips’s standards of interpre-
tation were of the highest
quality.

Duo-pianists
At their recital in Paling’s
concert-hall (Sydney) duo-
pianists Norma Read and
William Fraser achieved their
most felicitous playing in four-
hand work, and the best of this
came at the end, with some of
the Brahms waltzes from Op.
39. Here integration flowing
from a complete understanding
gave an extra fillip to the
rhythms and a better polish to
phrasing. This followed —also
at the same keyboard—a read-
ing of Schubert’s “Leben-
stiirme” which, despite some
overthick bass harmonies, drew
a strong melodic line.
A suitably light touch by
both players revealed much
of the grace and elegance of
a Mozart sonata, the filigree-
work being crisp and deft; and,
where the tempo dropped, the
lyrical flow was smooth.
Not so authoritative was a
fugue for two pianos by the
same composer, which began
the recital. Initial uncertainty
here led to faults of both
gear-meshing and tone-balance.
The Sonata (1942) by Hinde-
mith was a difficult assign-
ment. A craggy work, depend-
ing for its impact on un-
relenting vigor and unortho-
dox rhythmic patterns com-
bined with off-beat themes and
embracing some twisted
musical ideas, it is built around
a recurring three-note figure
which at times is used to the
point of monotony; but the
fugue which is its cornerstone
is a piece of lively invention.
Earlier in its tortuous byways
the recitalists seemed none too
comfortable, but they gathered
confidence with the fugue and
swept through it with no little
spirit.

“Yeomen of the Guard”
The practised hand of
Evelyn Gardiner was apparent
in the stylish and smooth-
running production for the G.
and S. Society at Sydney Con.
of the operetta which, of all
Gilsullivan, comes closest, by
reason of a more dramatic
libretto and a higher content of
serious music, to grand-opera.
The concerted singing of
the principals was highly effec-
tive —nowhere better than in
the beautiful quartet “When a
Lover Goes A-Wooing.” Light-
ness in volume in the choruses
was more than balanced by
tonal quality.
There were some excellent
individual performances. Mary
Blake’s was the best Dame
Carruthers Sydney has seen
and heard in 20 years, and her
splendid mezzo-contralto was
aided by faultless enunciation.
Betty Morison’s Phoebe had
pertness and vivacity, and she
sang “Were I Thy Bride” with
a winning mischievousness.
As Colonel Fairfax, John
Wirth used a strong, forthright
tenor with musicianship in “Is
Life a Boon” and “Free From
His Fetters Grim.” Leslie
Andrews was a Shadbolt of the
most hangdog sort, as lugu-
brious a “mad wag” as Gilbert
could have conceived. As
Jack Point, Jonathon Herbert
let the weight of a generally
sound performance lean more
towards the dramatic than the
comic.
Under Frank Johnstone, the
orchestra, after arousing early
misgivings with a ragged
account of the overture, settled
down to give a fairly good
account of its assignment.

Sydney Art
The week’s art in Sydney
comprises a rash of abstracts
at Farmer’s Blaxland Gallery,
where the Contemporary Art
Society is showing its 21st
annual inter-State exhibition;
oils by George Lawrence at
the Macquarie; and baubles
at the Clune Gallery, King’s
Cross.
Despite the large number of
vivid abstracts leaping from
the walls, the Farmer’s show
is relatively flat, and the reason
could well be that so many
of the painters, having accepted
the idiom of abstract art, are
simply putting paint onto the
canvas and hoping for the best.
Not only paint, either. Oscar
Edwards has a marvellous time
with actual pebbles and bits
of glass (but no diamonds)
in “The King of Diamonds”;
and Elwyn Lynn has a “Large
White College” ingeniously
made of hessian, newsprint and
other odds-and-ends.
Foster - Beale’s “Central
Rock” looks rather like the
Titanic going down ; there is
a watercolory coolness in
Ronald Steuart’s “Hawkesbury
River”; and Leonard Hessing’s
“The Bride,” while not particu-
larly feminine, is a nice black
piece of abstract composition.
Edward Hill has some fairly
pleasant steely moments in
“City Panorama” ; Feuerring’s
“Garden” is full of exotic
squiggles ; Jo Caddy has a firm
rock-like central figure in
“Composition”; and Bob
Dickerson has two firm pencil-
drawings— not abstracts.
At the Macquarie, George
Lawrence is exhibiting quiet
oils which depict, besides Aus-
tralian scenes, bits of England
and France. English influence
is evident in his large “Coastal
Farms,” with its hot reds and
Martens-colored trees; “City
at Night” seems to lean to
Lautrec in foreground figure-
movement ; “D ill ish a m,
Devon,” is pleasant, but a bit
postcardish ; a dark “Nocturne”
is slender and effective; and
there is a soothing “Beach at
Tabourie.”
The Clune show, titled
“Muffled Drums,” has muffled
work by Elwyn Lynn, John
Coburn, Oscar Edwards, Roy
Fluke and John Ogburn.
Fluke’s “Great Wall” is
interesting, mainly for its
surface-texture ; but the rest of
the stuff, far from making a
lighthearted protest about art-
lovers and critics, seems con-
trived and immature.

“Some Like It Hot”
This furiously paced,
brilliantly written and enor-
mously funny farce, set in
prohibition Chicago, gets off
to a remarkable start. A hearse,
with floral tributes atop, is on
its solemn way to Masonetti’s
funeral-parlors when a cop-
car heaves in sight and starts
pumping bullets into it; where-
upon a bunch of plug-uglies
keeping the coffin company let
down the back-window and
spray the flatfoots with hot
lead.
Cops being temporarily
rendered hors de combat, the
coffin, with a few of its
flowers shot off, is borne
reverently by the bullet-
headed pall-bearers into the
chapel, past the softly-playing
organ and thence into the
hooch-joint at the back, where
its contents are joyously distri-
buted around the tables.
A raid on the place touches-
off a gangland war ; the only
two witnesses to the rubbing-
out of one gang by another, led
by George Raft, are the saxo-
phonist in Raft’s hooch-joint
band (Tony Curtis) and the
bull-fiddle player (Jack
Lemmon). To escape liquida-
tion they don women’s clothes
and join a Los Angeles-bound
girls’ band, in which Marilyn
Monroe is vocalist.
Thereafter producer-director
Billy Wilder, pausing now and
then to take a hearty side-swipe
at Italian nabobs of gangsterism
and the melodramatic treat-
ment accorded them by Holly-
wood, uproariously thrusts the
impersonators into a variety of
strife. Highlights are an im-
promptu party thrown in the
upper berth of a Pullman by
“Daphne” Lemmon, who ex-
plains to the real girls that his
well-developed muscles come
from lugging his outsize in-
strument around; and a
sequence in which Lemmon is
the object of the unremitting
attentions of an amorous
millionaire (Joe E. Brown).
Most of the comedy is
handled expertly by Curtis,
Lemmon and Brown. The
Monroe, who has played so
many dumb-blonde roles she
can do it by dead-reckoning,
adds shape, substance and a
neat piece of daffiness to the
proceedings.

Dunlop Rubber Australia, Ltd.
A moderate div.-rate, enabling expan-
sion to be financed within the
framework of earning capacity, has
assisted the steady growth of the big
Dunlop group over the past decade. Ord.
divs., held at 8 p.c. from 1947 to 1953,
rose gradually in the following years to
reach the present 10 p.c. level in 1958.
The largest manufacturer of rubber
products in Australia, Dunlop Rubber
Australia, Ltd., was formed in 1920,
after the third reconstruction of a co.,
originally registered in 1899, to take
over the Australian rights and interests
of the English Dunlop Rubber Co. The
English co. obtained a large shareholding
in 1927 and two years later both Per-
driau Rubber Co. and Barnet Glass
Rubber Co. were absorbed. With the
development of new products, numerous
subsidiaries have been added to the
group, which now operates 25 factories,
mostly in N.S.W. and Victoria.
The manufacture of all types of
rubber-tyres provides Dunlop with over
two-thirds of its total income, but the
group also turns-out automotive batteries
and wheel-brakes, footwear, clothing,
waterproof garments, sporting - equip-
ment and industrial plastics as well as
an extensive range of rubber- and
synthetic-rubber products. The group’s
contribution to Australian post-war
development has been impressive and
has included supply of conveyor-belting,
hose, wedgropes and tank-linings to such
important projects as the Snowy River
scheme, Rum Jungle, Woomera, Mary
Kathleen and Kwinana and Geelong oil-
refineries.
Since 1950, paid capital has almost
doubled, increasing by £4,557,322.
In 1951, 1,267,500 £1 shares were
offered to shareholders at a pre-
mium of 7s. 6d. Kenworth Rubber,
Ltd., was acquired in 1955 for 370,032
ords. and last term the issue of a further
265,000 ords. saw the purchase of ord.
capital in a subsidiary. At balance-date
paid capital stood at £8,063,980 and in-
cluded £930,000 in 10 p.c. prefs. A
l-for-6 bonus-issue early this month
brought paid capital to its present level,
£9,252,977. The gift hand-out followed
on capitalisation of the share-premium
reserve, £1,154,314, and the asset-revalua-
tion reserve, £34,683.
Last year, group turnover moved
ahead by £6,104,451 to reach £57,104,451,
a record. This massive advance accords
with growing demand for tyres, tubes,
etc., from expansion of the motor, trans-
portation, mining, primary and secondary
industries as well as the overall rapid
growth in population of Australia. Con-
solidated net profit leapt £246,385 to
clear £1,785,669, also a record, after
setting aside £1,233,355 (up £247,717)
for tax and providing £1,234,971 (up
£221,909) for depreciation:

At the moment there is every indica-
tion that last year's profit-earning achieve-
ment will be bettered this term. Sales of
tyres have risen markedly over the last
12 months, and prospects for the
remainder of 1959 are favorable.
Immediate outlook for the Australian
tyre-industry as a whole appears optimis-
tic. Output of raw rubber in Papua and
New Guinea continues to rise. A
general-purpose, synthetic-rubber plant
is to be established in Australia by
Vacuum Oil Co. Pty. near its Altona
refinery in Victoria. Carbon-black, an
essential material in the manufacture of
motor-tyres, will shortly be manufactured,
also, at Altona, by the Australian Carbon
Black Pty. Until now all carbon-black
has been imported. In the near future
the tyre-industry should be able to get
about half its requirements from the new
factory, which will produce from 25-
million lb. to 30-million lb. of carbon-
black a year, and in so doing, save
Australia an annual expenditure overseas
of around £2 million.
On the other hand, but dependent
upon the pace of general development in
Australia and the consequent growth of
demand for the products of the tyre-
industry, competition could become
slightly keener later on, and perhaps even
acquire a sharp edge in 1960. The
industry’s export markets in Africa and
Asia have been encroached upon by, and
have suffered fairly substantially from,
intense Japanese competition. Thfe tyres

appeared on the local scene. B. F.
Goodrich Australia Pty. (formed by the
International B. F. Goodrich Co., of


U.S.A., and Ampol Petroleum, of

Davis Gelatine Consolidated, Ltd.
"VTow a booming business with
£1,500,000 paid-up capital, Davis
Gelatine had its origins in a small glue-
factory established in Auckland, N.Z.,
in 1881. Production of gelatine began
in 1913. Four years later, after an
export-market was established in Canada,
a factory was opened at Botany, N.S.W.
In 1929 a plant was established in Vic-
toiia. The gelatine and glue business
of Michaelis, Hallenstein and the Co. Pty.
was then taken-over.
In 1951 the co. acquired a 70 p.c.
interest in the only gelatine-manufac-
turer in South Africa ; then in 1958 a
65 p.c. holding in Nelson Dale and Co.,
Ltd., one of the oldest manufacturers of
edible and technical grades of gelatine
in the U.K., was acquired.
The Davis Gelatine group consists of
12 cos. in Australia, N.Z., South Africa,
Canada, the U.K. and (since last year)
the U.S.A. The subsidiary cos. listed
in last year’s published accounts are:
Davis Gelatine (Aust.) Pty., N.S.W.;
Glues and By-Products Pty., Vic.; Davis
Gelatine (N.Z.), Ltd.; Davis Gelatine
Industries Pty., South Africa; Geo.
Nelson Dale & Co., Ltd., U.K.; Davis
Gelatine Pty., Vic.; Davis Gelatine
(Canada); Davis Gelatine Incorporated,
N.Y., U.S.A.; Davis Gelatine, Ltd.,
U.K.; Davis Gelatine (Africa) (Pty.),
Ltd., South Africa ; The New Zealand
Glue Co., Ltd.; and D. G. Transport
Co. Pty., N.S.W.
Davis Gelatine Consolidated was
formed early in 1955 to put group-
interests under the control of a single
holding-co. The public subscribed
£300,000 of the £1,500,000 paid-up
capital, split-up into 20s. ord. stock-units.
The group produces edible gelatine,
widely used in foodstuffs and domestic
preparations. It also manufactures in-
dustrial gelatine, agar, glue and
adhesives (from both natural and
synthetic resins) with oil, tallow, bone-
flour, filter-materials and fertiliser as
readily marketable by-products.
Most of Australia’s output of gelatine
is produced in N.S.W. Statistics of
gelatine production are not available.
The upward trend in the manufacture
of gelatine is continuing, in spite of in-
creasing competition from imports. Sub-
stantial quantities were imported from
overseas (especially from the U.S.) as
edible gelatine, but were used indus-
trially. Over 60 p.c. of imported U.S.
gelatine was, in fact, photographic
gelatine. Imports from the Common-
wealth countries are admitted under the
preferential tariff rate, but the rest is
subject to substantial duties.
The group’s business in the year ended
June 30 last continued satisfactorily.
Consolidated net trading profit edged
upwards by £28,089 to £426,253, after
providing £131,412 (up £13,344) for
depreciation. Provision for tax increased
by £21,621 to £162,778, and seems to be
in excess of the ruling rates on the basis
of visible profits.
After deducting the proportion attri-
butable to minority interests in two sub-
sidiaries, the group’s consolidated net
profit was £252,354 (up £9795), including
£1266 income from investments:

Dividend remained steady at 8 p.c.

on sale of assets. After deducting £l2B
net increase in intangibles total reserves
and undistributed profits amounted to
£1,070,059, or more than a third of the
paid capital.
There were no important changes in
the group’s capital-structure during the
year under review, the capital remaining
at £1,500,000 for the fifth successive

and improving plant was continued,
financed from internal resources. Visible
capital-expenditure during the year
amounted to £393,227. The book-value
of fixed assets increased by £261,815 to
£1,863,430 during the year. Stocks rose
by £65,796 to £1,396,716 and debtors by

Davis Gelatine’s unique position in
Australia, satisfactory disclosed earning-
rates, extensive export-markets (last year
Australian exports of 'edible gelatine
totalled 1,280,0061 b., valued at £238,849)
and solid financial structure all add-up
to make the scrip’s potential attractive,
in spite of the modest 8 p.c. div.-distri-
bution. The last sale of the 20s. ords.
was made at 595., leaving the yield
at 2.7 p.c.
Consolidated Metal Products, Ltd.
■poRMED in 1950, Consolidated controls
a group of subsidiaries engaged in
lead-smelting and -refining, and manu-
facture of lead-oxide. The co. also pro-
duces equipment and component parts
for the assembly of storage-batteries and
is engaged in export-trade. It is the
largest buyer and processor of scrap-
lead in Australia, and one of the major
purchasers of virgin-lead ingots.
Consolidated holds a substantial in-
vestment in Electrical Equipment of Aus-
tralia, Ltd. (par value, £25,000). In
addition, there is a large and diversified
investment portfolio (including shares in
8.H.P., Commonwealth Engineering,
Martin Bright Steels, E.Z. Industries
and Bramble Industries).
The Consolidated Metal Products
group now controls seven fully-owned
subsidiaries. These are C. Doring Pty.,
Phoenix Chemical Co. Pty., Battery
Equipment Supply Co. Pty. (all in
N.S.W.); Lead Refineries Pty., Lead
Products Pty., and Battery Equipment
Supply Co. (Vic.) Pty. (in Vic.), and
Battery Equipment Supply Co. (Q’ld.).
The group's connections with the
battery-trade date back to 1934, when
Phoenix Chemical Co. Pty. was estab-
lished in Sydney to manufacture lead-
oxide. At the same time Battery Equip-
ment Co. was founded to produce
battery-plates.
The business expanded to Victoria,
leading to the formation of Lead Pro-
ducts Pty. in 1947 and Lead Refineries
Pty. in 1950. C. J. and W. F. Doring,
Sydney smelters and refiners, were
brought into the group’s interests in
1951.
On the whole the group has shown a
very creditable standard of capital-
expansion and growth of earning-power
since its formation in 1950. The profits
slipped only once, in 1957, due to the
drop in world lead-prices.
During the first six months of last
term the tonnage of lead smelted and
refined increased, assisted by the success-
ful installation and operation of new
mills and improved techniques. Sales of
lead-oxide improved appreciably. On
the other hand, sales of battery-com-
ponents fell, both in quantity and value.
Competitive conditions continued
throughout the year ended June 30, 1959,
but the co. succeeded in edging-up its

This represents an earning-
rate of 22.9 p.c. on the average
share-capital, and compares
with 25.7 p.c., 22.4 p.c. anxf
29.3 p.c. looking back over
1958 and the preceding two,
years respectively.
The profit was struck after'
writing-off £34,221 (up £2856),
for depreciation, paying
£4200 directors’ fees and
£3760 land tax and provid-
ing £71,597 (up £1861) for
taxation. The amounts set
aside for taxation in the last
five years appear to have been
consistently in excess of normal
requirements for visible profits
at current rates. Thus last
year’s tax provision was over
56 p.c. of the revealed profits,
while the existing tax-rate was
equivalent to 37.5 p.c. Pleasant
visions of undisclosed reserves
keep coming to one’s mind.
During the year the co.’s
share-capital was increased by
one-third (£150,000). The div.-
rate was fixed at 11 p.c. on the
new £600,000 paid capital, and
was amply covered by last
term’s earnings. On the figures
disclosed, and on Consoli-
dated’s past performance, the
co. could have absorbed an
unchanged 12| p.c. div. (on the
larger capital) without much
discomfort. The directors,
however, have elected to follow
a more conservative course,
limiting the initial distribution
on the new £600,000 capital to
11 p.c. This took-up £61,125
(up £4875). The reserves
received £66,054 and also
benefited by £Bl6 profit on sale
of assets and by an undisclosed
addition (£130).
The co. capitalised its
£lOO,OOO assets - revaluation
reserve and made a two-for-
nine bonus issue on March
20, 1959. At the same time a
cash issue, one-for-nine at par,
was made on the basis of the
pre-bonus share-capital.
The net effect of the two
issues was to raise Consoli-
dated’s paid-up capital to
1,200,000 10s. stock-units:

Following the capitalisation of
assets-revaluation reserve and
the transfer of last term’s un-
distributed profits the visible
reserves were shown at £258,000
(down £33,000). Apart from
that, there were no significant
changes on the liabilities side
of the consolidated balance-
sheet.
On the assets side, freehold
increased by £25,165 to
£231,610, but the book-value
of plant, machinery, etc.,
was £2925 lower at £128,025
showing the effect of heavy
depreciation write-offs over the
recent years. Investments in
other cos. went up by £51,261
to £242,503. The co. made
the £50,000 cash-issue of shares
in order to raise funds to
strengthen its investment port-
folio (the market value of
which was estimated at about
£330,000).
Stocks on hand were normal
at the current world price of
lead. Last year stocks were
shown at an unusually low
figure (due to a sharp fall in
world prices) and this explains
the big jump in book-value
over the last year (by £121,008
to £277,451). Cash was £67,846
lower at £35,307. Current ratio
worked out at almost 2.1 to 1.
Net tangible backing was

At the last sale the 10s. stock-

that an original shareholder
would have quadrupled his
capital over a period of 18
months, taking into account
the three-for-two cash-issue
last February.
Much of the co.’s strength
derives from its association
with Civil and Civic Contrac-
tors Pty., which sponsored the
co.’s formation and holds 30
p.c. of the paid capital. Civil
and Civic is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the big Dutch
construction firm, Bredeco’s
Bouwbedrijf, N.V., and since
its incorporation in 1951 has
been associated with varied and
substantial projects, including
contracts in connection with
the Snowy Mountains Scheme
and Caltex House (N.S.W.). Re-
cently Civil and Civic was
engaged in much-publicised
litigation over a newly-erected
block of home-units at Darling
Point, Sydney.
In addition, Lend Lease has
enjoyed considerable support
from the M.L.C., which
acquired a 20 p.c. equity-
holding and also advanced
£240,000 by way of long-term
loans.
Accounts for the year
ended June 30, 1959, reflect the
progress made by the co. At
balance-date paid-up capital
was £250,000, divided into
500,000 10s. stock-units. Un-
appropriated profits increased
by £12,640 to £14,738, follow-
ing the transfer of net profit
earned during the year
(£46,817, less £17,753 tax;
£5424 preliminary expenses
were written-off), minus the
8 p.c. div.-distribution, which
absorbed £ll,OOO. Profits made
during the last term equalled
an earning-rate of 22 p.c. on
the average share-capital.
The consolidated balance-
sheet, incorporating the co.’s
two wholly-owned subsidiaries
—North Shore Medical Centre,
Ltd., and Cecec (No. 1), Ltd.
—showed long-term liabilities
£18,600 higher at £323,600
(including £50,000 short-term
convertible debentures). Un-
secured current liabilities
amounted to £124,273, bank
overdraft was £3816 ; other
liabilities were obligations
under contracts of sale
(£291,567) and income yet to
mature (£223,825).
Assets totalled £1,231,819
(up £554,542), including land
and buildings, and work-in-
progress £406,281, shares and
loans to associated cos.
£342,716 and contract debtors
£841,409. Other fixed assets
were £1413.
After the close of accounts
there were five major develop-
ments. The co. took-over
Regional Centres, Ltd., which
operates a modern shopping-
centre at Top Ryde. This
acquisition should return a
high rate on the investment.
Lend Lease had acquired a
large shareholding in Richard-
son and Wrench (with its
managing-director joining the
R. and W. board), strengthen-
ing considerably its competitive
position. The co. also decided
to undertake land - trust
management, opening-up a new
major field of operations.
In August, 1959, the co.
announced the issue of
£300,000 registered first mort-
gage debenture stock. In
October a new one-for-two
cash issue at par was made.
Lend Lease has under con-
struction in Sydney a large
block of 40 modern home-
units at Elizabeth Bay (Ithaca
Gardens, scheduled for com-
pletion in December) and
another (of 48 home-units) at
Kirribilli.
Land has been purchased
and negotiations are proceed-
ing for development of several
other . projects, including an
office-block and professional
suites in Macquarie Street,
home-units at Blue’s Point and
a land subdivision at St. Ives.
In addition, both land, and
options on land, have been
secured in Melbourne and
Sydney.
These ventures should prove
profitable in the light of pre-
vailing business trends.
Directors have already fore-
cast a 1 p.c. boost (to 9 p.c.)
in the 1959-60 div.-rate.
Growth-potential, rather
than the small immediate
returns, tend to be the main
factor behind the progress of
Lend Lease stock on the
’Change. At the last sale the
10s. ords (backed by £1 Is. of
net tangible assets) brought
375. (rights 275.), yielding 2.4
p.c. on the basis of a 9 p.c.
dividend.

From Herbert Holman
General Election
TThis was a puzzling election.
A The Conservatives were
favorites throughout ‘ the cam-
paign but the straw-polls were
widely out with their final fore-
cast (this inaccuracy has now
been explained by the essen-
tial two-day gap between
assembling the inquiries and
collating them). What particu-
larly confounded the experts
was the high percentage (8 to
10) of “don’t-knows.”
The 100 majority, represent-
ing a 60 per cent, increase oil
the 1955 one, is handsome
enough but it is no landslide,
for only 11 marginal voters out
of 1000 have changed their
minds since last time. Such a
result certainly cannot be
regarded as a “blank cheque”
to Mr. Macmillan.
He is, and must remain,
answerable to the electorate
on the single important issue
of prosperity, and the future of
his party is inseparably linked
with a rising standard of living.
The Conservatives believe
this election is a turning-point:
that henceforward they can
claim to be accepted as repre-
senting the nation as a whole.
This may well be in the not-
so-near future. Nevertheless,
out of the 79 per cent, poll,
44 per cent, of the people
voted Labor, against 49 per
cent. Conservative, which sug-
gests that the prejudice (or,
put another way, feeling of
“having nothing in common”)
will need a lot of breaking
down.
So far as the “don’t-knows”
were concerned, the question
that teased them was not “Shall
I vote Conservative or Labor?”
but “Shall I vote Liberal?” The
difference is that, while in
previous elections a Liberal
intervention has tended to split
the Conservative vote, thus
favoring the Labor candidate,
this time it had the reverse
effect. The marginal voter has,
in fact, demonstrably indi-
cated that he has no time for
Socialism.
End of an Epoch?
Here is the real turning-
point. The pattern of voting
showed quite early that
Labor was not holding its
ground. (After only fifteen
results, “Deuce,” the electronic
computer, indicated a Tory
majority of about 100 and
kept consistently to this figure.
And Mr. Gaitskell acknow-
ledged defeat before half the
results were known.) So
Britain, following North
America and Australia, has
endorsed the trend away from
Socialism.
Not only has old-fashioned
doctrinaire Socialism lost its
appeal but the nation for the
most part dislikes and mis-
trusts trade-unionism.
It is testing-time for the
Opposition, but there is little
chance of a reformation. Mr.
Gaitskell, it is true, recognised
the trend long ago and, no
doubt, would dearly have liked
to steer his party away from
the undertow. But he was, and
is, hamstrung by the diehards
and dependent upon the trade-
unions for his revenue.
Another aspect of the mood
of the electorate that com-
mentators have noticed is the
simple one of pride—pride that
goes with achievement. The
young, we learn, are ambitious
and like to identify their
country’s progress with them-
selves. The negative altitude of
Socialist propaganda strikes
them as ridiculous.
REIGHHOLD CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES
(AUSTRALIA) LIMITED, SYDNEY
CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS, DELIVERED
BY MR. E. S. WOLFENDEN.
AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE COMPANY HELD AT
THE REGISTERED OFFICE, 49/61 STEPHEN ROAD, BOTANY, ON
WEDNESDAY, 30th SEPTEMBER, 1959, AT 2.30 p.m.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I take great pleasure in
welcoming you to this Fifth
Annual General Meeting,
and the first in our newly-
extended administrative office
block.
This is a further sign of
progress within our organisa-
tion, and you may be sure
that immediate benefit has
been gained from the cen-
tralising of management and
administration at the main
manufacturing site at Botany.
The past year has been
most profitable for , your
Company, as you will see
from a survey of the first
page inside the 1959 Annual
Report, headed “Statistics
for Stockholders,” to which
I now refer. Every figure
quoted by me has exceeded
the comparative figure for the
previous year. Whilst this is
not perhaps quite what we
would like in regard to the
figures for taxation, it is
reasonable to assume that
our Stockholders are just as
pleased with the overall
result as your Directors and
Executive Staff.
The Consolidated Net
Profit for the year shows at
£294,986, which is a record
result since establishment of
the Holding Company five
years ago. Such profit
exceeds the 124-% Ordinary
Dividend and the 5% Prefer-
ence Dividend by more than
60%. A further £70,000 has
been transferred to General
Reserve, which increases the
total in this account to
£450,000, which, together
with other Reserves, now
total £657,978.
Issued Capital has increased
slightly since last Annual
Accounts, as a result of the
purchase of our new New
Zealand subsidiary company,
Morcom-Green & Edwards
Limited. This newly acquired
business has achieved a
further goal for our organisa-
tion in establishing a manu-
facturing centre in Auck-
land, in addition to the one
already operating profitably
in Wellington, New Zealand.
Over the past decade
expansion has been continu-
ous, and I feel confident in
reporting that there has never
been a time when some new
plant installation has not
been in process. This, of
course, requires continual
Capital expenditure, and to
aid our finances in this
direction an issue of 6\%
Unsecured Convertible Notes
of 10/- each was made to
Stockholders on the Register
on 23rd March, 1959, in the
ratio of one Note for each
five Stock Units held. At
the same time an allocation
of Unsecured Notes was
retained for issue to key
employees of executive status
throughout our organisation.
The resultant issue of
employees’ Notes was made
through the newly-formed
Reichhold Chemicals Staff
Provident Fund, and I feel
sure that this fund will be of
great benefit both to our staff
and to the Company.
This is an opportune time
to make reference to our
employees in the Reichhold
Group. Over the past year
it has been most noticeable
how well the staff in all
different locations have corn-
bined efficiency with a very
fine spirit of team-work,
On behalf of my Board I
would like to register our
appreciation of the effort
given by all Executive Staff
and employees, resulting in
a Profitable year

Memoirs of a
Pioneer Pressman
(Abridged from a book to be published later)
By B. S. BAXTER COOK
(Founder of the Australian Journalists' Association and No. 1 A.J.A. Gold Medallist)
Although we did not have
much money sixty years
ago, senior members of
the “Herald” staff and
those of other Melbourne
papers were expected to have in
their wardrobes what was then,
and for many years, the
fashionable outfit for outdoor
dressy functions: a frock-coat,
grey striped trousers and a bell-
topper.
How we all managed it
was a financial achievement on
which I can only look back
with some degree of pride. I
must confess, however, that
the cost of such a made-to-
measure outfit by one of the
best tailors would not exceed
£lO. As to the ordinary sac-
suit, I remember buying a
made-to-measure blue vicuna
suit with two pairs of trousers
for £2 10s. It lasted me for
many years. But this was
during the depression towards
the end of the last century
and the beginning of the present
one, after the bursting of the
land-boom.
There were no picture-shows
and very few motor-cars to
entice people to spend their
money recklessly in those days.
Pressmen saved a bit of
expense by the privilege they
enjoyed of having their names
“on the doors” of all the legiti-
mate theatres. This meant that
they had free entry any night
with a lady companion, so
long as each reporter put his
name down in the office theatre-
book for a particular night,
to avoid the risk of more than
one representative of each
office being present at the same
time.
When the frock-coat era was
gradually passing, the Beaufort
outfit with fancy waistcoat and
boxer-hat came in. I had one
of them, too. This went out
of fashion in due course, and
in came the sac-suit —black
coat and vest, with grey striped
trousers. This, in the way of
dress, was all that was needed
for functions, even for Govern-
ment House and Parliamentary
garden-parties.
The last time I saw my bell-
topper one of my grandsons
was using it to prove that he
could materialise a rabbit from
its interior. Possibly my shiny
tile finished-up at some frowsy
old theatrical costumier’s shop.
T wonder how many are alive
A today who “did The Block”
sixty years ago? “The Block”
was the section of Collins
Street on the north side from
Elizabeth Street to Swanston
Street. Saturday morning was
the fashionable hour when the
young bloods met their bud-
ding lady-loves and the older
business tycoons met the
fashionable matrons.
The Block was accepted by
the costumiers of the day as the
locale of the fashion-parades.
The principals of these dress-
designing establishments would
be seen at various vantage-
points to note how their crea-
Henry Lawson, as Will
Dyson saw him for “The
Bulletin Poets” series in
1908, two years before the
memorable visit to Malla-
coota related in this
instalment.
tions looked in actual wear,
and also to see what their com-
petitors were up to.
Not much time was spent on
The Block, except by the
younger folk who got together
in groups, the personnel of
which was constantly changing.
Once up and down was usually
sufficient for the older folk.
Having met their friends they
went off to convenient clubs or
to a nearby cafe for morning-
tea.
The moving multitude, how-
ever, was always interesting to
those who were merely sight-
seers. They had heard of The
Block as a famous meeting-
place and wanted to see some
of the celebrities, just as many
people today go to the Mel-
bourne Cup principally to see
the socialites, the racing being
merely incidental.
So much had The Block
become recognised as a rendez-
vous that some of the society-
journals ran a column headed
“Seen on The Block,” with
descriptions of the ladies’
dresses. The caricaturists also
came to light. Their drawings
were usually clever. One series
I remember bore the caption
“Things We See When We
Come Out Without Our Gun.”
There was a sprinkling of
members of Parliament who
used The Block as a convenient
place in an amiable atmosphere
where they could meet friends


“I like Melbourne. There’s so much more bustle
here than in Sydney.”
—Phil May in B. 9/4/1887. (Other illustrations, without captions,
on these two pages are from Phil May’s “On The Block” or “Things
We See When We Come Out Without Our Gun” series, first published
in The Bulletin.)
and constituents. A regular
Blockite, E. L. Zox, M.L.A.,
was a great teller of funny
stories, and in the telling of
them he never spared himself.
There was the occasion when
he slipped on the pavement in
Collins Street. When the bulky
gentleman had been helped to
his feet and asked, “What
happened?” he replied, “Only
a heavy Jew falling.”
He was the joy of the carica-
turists, always wearing a white
waistcoat, his embonpoint
emphasising its expanse.
The bright young men of
those days were referred to by
less fortunate employees, who
did not have time to gossip on
The Block, as “Block
Johnnies.” Fancy waistcoats
were the vogue, the buttons
often being real agates. A
popular piece of fancywork by
young ladies was the working
of pretty designs on hucka-
back material for their sweet-
hearts. These young bucks did
not think they were completely
equipped for The Block unless
they had obtained from the
florist a small, neatly-made
spray of flowers which they
inserted in a buttonhole.
Usually behind the lapel was
hooked a thin tube to hold
water to keep the spray fresh,
For a few crowded hours
each Saturday morning The
Block presented a colorful
cross-section of open-air social
life. The coup de grace was
given to The Block parade when
the police began to enforce the
“move-on” regulation. It had
to end sometime, because the
gossipers became so numerous
as to completely hold-up
pedestrian traffic.
FELLOW SCRIBES
I did not like the “Age” of
the old days, when it was
personally controlled by
David Syme, with its dic-
tatorial attitude on public
affairs and its personal ven-
dettas against public men and
officials who had dared not to
follow its directions (the old
phobias have been dropped,
and the “Age” is a splendid
paper today).
I felt then that the “Argus”
was more dignified and a better
literary production. Also, my
early regard for the old
“Argus” was largely due to my
enjoyment, as a cub reporter,
of the contributions of the top
men. Of the many I could
mention, John Sandes comes to
mind now as a particularly
brilliant “Argus” staff-man.
He was usually marked in the
duty-book for the big social
events. On one occasion he
and other pressmen, in full
evening-dress, in accordance
with the custom of those days,
arrived at Government House
in St. Kilda Road to report a
ceremonial dinner.
The English aide-de-camp,
not understanding the demo-
cratic ways of “these colonials,”
had the pressmen ushered up
a back stairway to an out-of-
the-way room. They were told
that when the time arrived for
the speechmaking they would
be conducted to the banquet-
ing chamber.
Sandes’s dignity was out-
raged. Speaking for his col-
leagues as well as for himself,
he told the official that if the
pressmen were not at once
admitted to the banqueting-
hall they would leave in a
body.
There was a hurried con-
sultation in the Gubernatorial
set-up, apologies were tendered,
and the pressmen were then
treated as guests fit to mix with
the elite.
Lord “Dicky” Nevill.
A.D.C. to several Gover-
nors and popular every-
where (as David Low
saw him).
This incident was known to
few outside the ranks of work-
ing-journalists, no mention of
it having been made in the
newspaper reports of the func-
tion. But it tickled journalists


to reflect that a leading mem-
ber of the staff of the most con-
servative newspaper of those
times should figure as a “strike
leader.”
His action had a good effect.
Not for many years did I hear
of any such similar action be-
littling the press. It was in
1958 that there was a some-
what similar occurrence. It
happened in connection with
the Queen’s Birthday levee in
Brisbane. Reporters and press-
photographers were bluntly
told that they would not be
admitted. The Queensland
District of the Australian
Journalists’ Association, backed
by the newspaper proprietors,
banned reports of the function,
excepting a mere mention. It
was afterwards explained that
the Governor’s English staff
had applied the London levee
procedure, where only invited
guests could attend. An
assurance was given that such
a thing would not happen
again.
Generally speaking, the
private-secretaries and A.D.C.s
This other A.D.C. figured
in a Bulletin cartoon in
the ’nineties over the gag-
line “More Trouble for
Victoria.”
of Governor-Generals and
State Governors were, and are,
helpful to pressmen doing the
official functions. Lord
Richard Neville was, perhaps,
the most popular. He came
first to Australia as A.D.C. to
Lord Brassey in 1895, and was
again in Victoria in 1909 in a
similar capacity to Sir Thomas
Carmichael. He was known
familiarly as “Dicky” to
socialites and working-journa-
lists alike.
Intention of John Sandes
brings to mind one of the
most brilliant weekly columns
that graced the Melbourne
papers of his day. It was
entitled “The Passing Show”
and appeared in the “Argus.”
The first contributors were
John Sandes, Donald Mac-
donald and Davison Symmons,
the latter nicknamed “Peter.”
It was Peter who suggested the
nom-de-plume “Oriel,” because
of its meaning, “a bay-
window.”
I hope I may be pardoned
for recalling in particular my
youthful hero-worship of this
most likeable and capable
journalist. In the middle of
his brilliant work he seemed
to have otherwise unemployed
brain-cells capable of t£king-in
conversations going on within
earshot without interrupting
the train of thought on his
writing. Suddenly he would
drop his pen and proceed to
tell an entertaining story him-
self, apropos of what the other
fellows had been talking about.
He never minded being inter-
rupted, except when the copy-
boy came in saying the printer
was waiting. Peter was always
behind with his writing,
although it flowed from his
pen so smoothly. He was one
of the kindest mentors I ever
met in my cub days.
Macdonald told the story of
Symmons’s solicitude for stray
dogs, which he could not
resist taking home. Such a
mongrel had annoyed
Symmons’s neighbors by howl-
ing at night, and one of the
sufferers came down in the
early morning to remonstrate.
“Not your dog?” he said,
when Symmons truthfully
repudiated ownership. “But,
my dear sir, he is on your
mat!”
“So are you,” Symmons
retorted, “but you are not my
dog.”
Donald Macdonald himself
was a cultured journalist who
could write comprehensively
on almost any subject. He had
a particular hobby in nature-
studies, and wrote a weekly
column, “Nature Notes,” for
the “Argus.”
On one occasion he was
standing on the steps of the
“Argus” office and suddenly
noticed that one of the plane-
trees near the Town Hall had
lost very few of its leaves,
while the other trees in the
vicinity had reached the usual
winter defoliation.
He went back to his desk
and rang Guilfoyle, the then
Curator of the Botanic
Gardens. The botanist offered
the suggestion that the tree
might be near an arc-light, and
therefore lived in a kind of
perpetual daylight. Mac had
a closer look and found that
it was so. He went back once
more to his desk and wrote a
nice little nature-note pointing
out how the ways of men
were interfering with the ways
of Nature.
When Australia, in 1899,
resolved to dispatch a con-
tingent to the South African
War the three Melbourne daily
papers decided to send
accredited war-correspondents.
The doyen of the party was
big, popular Mac. He was
one of those who were trapped
in the siege of Ladysmith, but
he managed to smuggle out
colorful dispatches which were
widely read, not only in Aus-
tralia but in many other
countries.
/■'Vne of Peter Symmons’s
contributions in the lighter
vein related to the first bill to
impose an income-tax in Vic-
toria. It was introduced into
the Victorian Parliament in
1893 by G. D. Carter,
Treasurer in the Patterson
Ministry. Those who would
be called on to pay the tax
were, of course, resentful, but
Peter found a champion for
Carter in the person of a
“wuckin’ man,” who let him-
self go in this style:
Oh, take me to some quiet pub,
Not such as gilt and glass
embellish,
W’ere wuckin’ folk can talk an
smoke,
Or sip their ’arf a pint with relish.
In Friendship’s name we’ll drink
our whacks,
And 'ere's an ’ealth to foiler arter,
May 'Eaven defend our inkum-tax,
And Gawd bless Mr. G. D.
Carter.
But the “wuckin’ mans”
sardonic satisfaction was short-
lived. Carter’s bill was so
unpopular that it had to be
withdrawn a couple of months
later. In 1894 another income-
tax bill was introduced ; this
time by Mr. George Turner
(later Sir George). It was
passed in January, 1895. South
Australia appears to have set
the example by placing an
income-tax bill on the statute-
books as far back as 1884. It
was followed by Tasmania in
1894 and N.S.W. in 1895.
Queensland and Western Aus-
tralia passed income-tax Acts
after Federation.
HENRY LAWSON
SILHOUETTE
It must be fifty years ago
that I first met Henry
Lawson. Jack Winter, son
of “The Boss,” and I had
decided on a holiday tour, Mel-
bourne to Eden (N.S.W.),
taking in Mallacoota, a far-
distant coastal resort not very
far from Gabo Island on the
north-eastern tip of Victoria.
Lawson was there with T. D.
Mutch (N.S.W. journalist who
later was Minister for Educa-
tion in N.S.W.) and E. J.
Brady, poet and author, both
of whom I had previously
known.
Our project was a rather
ambitious cycling adventure.
We decided to go by rail to
Sale, stack our bicycles on a
river-boat to Lakes Entrance,
and then push the bikes the
rest of the way. We each car-
ried a swag containing changes
of clothing, boots, etc., a few
hundred cartridges, and fishing-
lines, -rods and sinkers. We
each had a double-barrel shot-
gun slung over our shoulders.
Our load was so heavy that
we had to walk much of the
distance, some 140 miles. The
going was particularly hard
over Mount Drummer.
There was only one accom-
modation-house at Mallacoota.
It was known as “Allens’,” and
was conducted by a pioneer
of the district. The family still
live there. Brady had a per-
manent camp not far away,
where he lived with his family
for many years. He did most
of his writing there.
Among the attractions adver-
tised for Allens’ were swim-
ming, fishing, shooting,
billiards, etc. I was curious

A Ribuck Spree
By H. P. ("Duke") TRITTON
Old Danny was our local
bottle-oh. He called
every second Monday,
and as we usually had
a session on Saturday nights
there were always a few dozen
empties for him. And as I
would never accept payment
for them, being glad to get
rid of them, we became very
good friends.
On one visit I found a
couple of full bottles that had
been overlooked at a previous
party, so Danny put the nose-
bag on his horse and we
adjourned to the back lawn to
knock them off.
He was in a reminiscent
mood and I knew he would
tell a story of his larrikin days,
on The Rocks when Griffo
was king. Having been a
milk-and-water larrikin myself
a few years back, I was always
eager to hear Danny’s yarns
of the mighty men of the
generation before mine. And
his cauliflower-ears and flat-
tened nose were mute evidence
that it had been a tough era.
He started off: “The best
spree we ever had was at
Pyrmont. An old bloke, Cock-
ney Bob, had a livery stable
in a lane off Miller Street and
he had a big feed-shed with
a pretty good floor for danc-
ing. Bob was a hard-case, and
though he’d pinch the eye out
of a needle, he had a hell of
a nark on booze. Wouldn’t
touch it himself and didn’t like
to see anyone else have a
drink. He lent us the shed
on condition there’d be no
drinking or fighting.
“Well, there was a lot of
chaff and oats in the shed, so
we had to carry it out into
an empty stall, and that made
a bosker place to plant the
grog.
“There was a big turn-up,
blokes from every push in
town, and donahs in galore.
Griffo was there, Johnny Gilli-
gan from Redfern, Bricky
Keen ; Bluey Norris brought
Sal Jerks, Tommy the Nut had
Lady Munro, and there were
dozens of other blokes and
donahs.”
I interrupted him: “Wait
a bit, Danny. Tell me a bit
about these characters. I
wasn’t born when they were
about.”
TTe grinned. “I forgot. Well
you don’t have to be told
about Griffo, do you?”
“No,” I replied. “I’ve heard
a lot about him.”
“All right. Johnny was the
leader of the Redfern push
for a good while. Bricky Keen
was about the crookedest
jockey that ever straddled a
horse. He couldn’t even lay
straight in bed. Bluey was a
rabbit-oh and had the flashest
cart in Sydney. Sal Jerks had
an ice-cream barrow, but she
did most of her work at night.
Battling Bill was a pug from
Camperdown. He couldn’t
fight for sour apples, but he
won a lot of scraps because
the other coves knocked-up
trying to knock him out. His
sheila, Big Liz, was a profes-
sional, her beat was on Harris
Street and Bullawarra Road.
“Tommy the Nut was the
flashest - dressed cove in
Sydney. Everything he wore
was hand-made: he wore a
straw hat with a brim only
half-an-inch wide, tight coat
and trousers and a wide red
tie with a naked sheila painted
on it. But his shoes were the
dead finish ; set in the toe of
each was a photograph of his
special sheila. Sometimes he
would have little round looking-
glasses instead of the photos.
Blime! he was a nut all right.”
I asked: “What about Lady
Munro? Was she a fair-
dinkum Lady?”
He answered: “I wouldn’t
know. I was never game to ask
her. But her name on the
charge-sheets was always Lady
Munro. You wouldn’t think
Johns had a sense of humor,
but it was always reckoned to
be a good joke to send a young
copper, on his first job, to pick
her up when she was on the
rampage.”
What Danny told me she
would do to the unfortunate
young constable who was
unlucky enough to fall for the
job of arresting her shocked
even me. And I’m tough. So
I won’t go into details.
“Danny,” I said, “you knew
a lot of nice people.”
“Oh, yes, they weren’t a bad
mob. There was one cove
there that no one knew. He
was a tall, sunburnt cove with
big shoulders and a dial as
hard-looking as a junk of blue-
metal. He didn't talk much
but said he was a shearer and
came from outback.”
Danny paused and rubbed
his chin. “I’ve often wondered
about him, I think he could
have been that bloke Henry
Lawson wrote about. You
know, the Bastard from the
Bush. He was that kind of a
bloke.
“ A nyhow, the dance was
going on nicely till Sheeny
Joe bumped into a bloke from
the ’Loo and stopped a punch.
Sheeny was no mug with his
maulers and they got stuck
into it.
“Of course, everybody took
sides, and punches were slung
in all directions. There had
been bad blood between Liz
and Sal over trespassing on
each other’s beats, and they
got into holts. There was no
hair-pulling but they stood up
and swapped punches till Liz
took Sal in the belly and she
went down. Bluey did his
block and swiped Liz, and the
Battler smacked him down.
“It was on properly then.
Then some silly coot took a
poke at the bloke from the
bush. He didn’t even flinch.
He leLout a howl like a dingo
and waded in for his cut. Every
time he slung a punch some-
body went down and stayed
down. Strike me dead, that
cove could fight!
“Griffo was trying to get
to him, and they met in the
middle of the room. They
stood staring at each other,
and the crowd scrambled back
to give them room.”
He stopped.
“Well,” I said, “what
happened?”
He shook his head and
sighed deeply. “The Johns,”
he said sadly. “About twenty
bloody Johns and Demons.
The place was stinking with
the cows.
“A big sergeant said he was
going to summons the lot of
us for disturbing the peace and
they started round with their
books taking names. The
stranger wouldn’t be in this.
He made for the door, and the
Johns closed in on him. He
went through them like a dose
of salts. Two Demons grabbed
him, but he stoushed one and
tossed the other on the top
of his head in the gutter, and
went scarping up the lane and
round the corner like a flaming
emu. The Demons squirted
a few shots at him, but he got
clean away.”
“How would he have got
on with Griffo had they
fought?” I asked.
Danny looked at me scorn-
fully. “He would’ve got his
ears belted off. No one could
beat Griffo. But,” he con-
ceded, “it would’ve been a
mighty scrap. Something to
write home about. I never
saw or heard of him again,
but still think he was the
Bastard from the Bush:
“Him getting away annoyed
the Johns, and they lumbered
the mob. We filled two Black
Marias and they got Robbo’s
four-horse bus, and it was
damn’-near full, too. We
brought a quid apiece, but we
all reckoned it was worth a
quid. It was a Ribuck Spree.”

The Melbourne
Carnival
Australia’s most important
racing carnival —Cup Week in
Melbourne —begins next Satur-
day with Derby Day. During
the four days of the meeting
the V.R.C. will distribute over
£60,000 in stakemoney.
Cup Week in very much its
present form goes back to 1869,
when the V.R.C. first extended
its Spring Carnival to four
days. The Melbourne Cup
itself dates to 1861 ; run then
by the Victoria Turf Club,
which gave place in 1864 to
the Victoria Racing Club.
Sydney owner-trainer Etienne
De Mestre won the first two
Melbourne Cups with Archer,
and De Mestre and another
great Sydney trainer, John
Tait, so dominated the early
years of the Cup that between
them they won nine of the
first 18 Cups; five to De
Mestre, four to Tait. In later
years, W. S. Hickenbotham
and Dick Bradfield also trained
four winners.
Bobby Lewis holds riding honors
for the great race, with four
winners, stretching from The Vic-
tory in 1902 to Trivalve in 1927.
Darby Munro, Jack Purtell and
W. H. McLachlan all rode three
Cup winners.
Four-year-olds have won 27 Cups,
five-year-olds 25, three-year-olds 23
(the last, Skipton, in 1941), six-
year-olds 15, aged horses eight.
Carbine set a still-unbeaten
weight-record when he carried 10.5
and downed 38 rivals in 1890. The
only other winners to carry 10.0
or better have been Archer (10.2)
in 1862 and Poitrel (10.0) in 1920.
Only two horses have won the
race twice —Archer in 1861 and ’62,
and Peter Pan in 1932 and ’34.
Next Tuesday will see the 99th
running of the Cup, which this
year carries prizemoney of £15,000
in addition to the £5OO Cup. The
winner will take the trophy and
£lO,OOO. It is a long way from
the first Cup—a sweepstake of 20
sovereigns each runner, with 200
sovereigns added by the V.T.C.
Originally it was winner take all,
with no prize for second or third.
Minor placegetters in the
A.J.C. Metropolitan have a
good record in the Cup, and
possibly Royal Jester, second
to Macdougal this year, will
enhance that record. Royal
Jester can get two miles —he
was second to Froth in the
Auckland Cup in the smart
time of 3.l9j—and with 8.6
he is well handicapped for a
five-year-old. Grand Garry’s
second to Noholme in last
Saturday’s W. S. Cox Plate at
Moonee Valley was an excel-
lent run, and the four-year-old
Dalray gelding has a second to
Macdougal in the two-miles
Brisbane Cup to his credit.
Mac, winner of the Adelaide
Cup, is another proved two-
miler and his form has been
excellent.
Yemen was very unlucky to
lose the Cup last year, but his
form on this visit has not been
up to the mark. . Travel Boy
blotted his copybook badly in
the Cox Plate, in which both
Trellios and last year’s Cup
“Ride an honest race, and remember our motto —
'A fair deal for the punter ”
winner, Baystone, also per-
formed poorly. The Caulfield
Cup winner must be respected
in the Melbourne Cup, and
with only 7.8 Regal Wench
should run well. Of the rest,
Macdougal is under a cloud,
Sir Blink and Chicola seem to
have too much weight, and
Foxmara and Gaybao did not
run well enough in the Moonee
Valley Cup. New Zealand Cup
winner Balfast will have
friends, and should give them
a good sight. Dhaulagiri’s
Cup run may depend on his
Derby showing, but he is a
very good colt, and if he runs
in the Cup he will command
respect. Moonbridge, fourth
in the Cox Plate, has a sound
Cup chance with only 7.8.

Melbourne Cup Selections:

Derby Day at Flemington
offers as well-balanced a day’si
racing as anybody could wish.
Sydney-trained horses have
won the V.R.C. classic six out
of eight times this decade, the
exceptions being Sailor’s Guide
and Sir Blink. The colorful
grey Martello Towers may
start favorite next Saturday,
but possibly Dhaulagiri will
win the classic for Victoria.
The High Peak colt has greatly
impressed this writer since his
first win at Caulfield some
months ago, and, while the
grey is very good, Dhaulagiri
may be too strong for him in
the run home.
For the Derby : Dhaulagiri,
1 ; Martello .Towers, 2;
Travel Boy, 3.
The five-furlongs £2500
Maribyrnong Plate (two-year-
olds) has also been a good race
for Sydney entrants —five of
the last seven. However, it
could be Adelaide’s turn, as
Dalai, unbeaten in three starts
at home, is reported to be very
good. Dalai is trained by Nor-
man Plews, who won the
Maribyrnong Plate with Cellar
Master in 1951. Victoria’s
best hopes look to be the smart
filly Impulsive and the un-
beaten Milverton.
Maribyrnong Plate Selec-
tions : Dalai, 1 ; Impulsive, 2 ;
Milverton, 3.
•' • • •
The balance of the Derby Day
programme is made up of the
10-furlongs w.-f.-a. Mackinnon
Stakes (Comic Court, Delta and
Rising Fast have made it a
stepping-stone to the Cup), the
Hotham Handicap (often a good
Cup guide—Baystone won the
double last year), the mile Cantala
Stakes, the six-furlongs Smithfield
Handicap and the 10-furlongs
Wakeful Stakes for fillies (often a
preview of the Oaks).
The Moonee Valley Cup has
rarely been a sound guide to
the Melbourne Cup, and this
year is not likely to be differ-
ent. The winner, Sanvo, is
not in the big Flemington race,
and the placegetters, Nether
Gold and Auteuil, are suspect
over two miles. First-prize of
£3200 in the Valley Cup was
easily the most important suc-
cess achieved by the five-year-
old Sans Tache horse Sanvo,
with whom trainer Frank Mus-
chialli is now hoping to win
the Williamstown Cup.
Chicola’s close fourth was her
best run this spring, particu-
larly as she was forced to act
as pacemaker.
Noholme turned-in the best
exhibition of galloping seen in

Melbourne for a long time to
win the rich W. S. Cox Plate
as he liked. The Star King-
dom colt left all who saw the
Plate wondering.how on earth
he lost the Caulfield Guineas.
Noholme was easy in the market,
the reason being a doubt that a
Star Kingdom colt would get 10
furlongs. However, the circular
Valley track is not a true staying-
test —another Stair Kingdom three-
year-old, Kingster, won the Cox
Plate, as Noholme did, by sheer
speed.
Sellwood used Noholme’s speed
from barrier-rise. The colt led five
lengths at the mile, was eased back
to a length in front at the turn,
then given full rein, to career
away in the straight for a four-
lengths win in race-record time of
2.2 7/10. Travel Boy endeavored
to pace it with Noholme, but was
hopelessly burnt-off. The Dalray
gelding Grand Garry impressed
greatly with a run from fourth at
the turn to second place, and
Prince Lea hung on well for third
money. Mac and Moon Bridge
did reasonably well to dead-heat
for fourth.
• • • •
First division of the St.
Albans Stakes (five-furlongs;
two-year-olds) was won by the
Hydrogen-Bella Yorker geld-
ing Hydrell, trained by Sydney
mentor Jack Green, who now
has hopes of the youngster
landing the Byron Moore
Stakes on Oaks Day. Adelaide
filly Makoli, who took the
Second St. Albans, came to
Melbourne with a big reputa-
tion, but ran unplaced, at odds-
on, at her first start, at Caul-
field. It transpires that she hit
her head in the starting-gates;
A pity the average racegoer
has to wait until too late to
acquire knowledge of such
accidents.
The High Peak colt My
Peak gave further evidence of
his class by winning the second
Dundonald Welter at his ease,
to make his record five wins
from his last eight starts. His
time for the six furlongs,
1.12 3/10, was exceptionally
good for the Valley. He is
due to run in the Railway
Highweight on Cup Day, and
will be worth support.
Hitherto disappointing, the
Empyrean colt Worthing,
trained by Fred Hoysted and
raced by A. R. Creswick (who
was recently elected to the
V.R.C. committee), won the
Greenvale Handicap, a coming
winner from which is Bell
Rope, who finished brilliantly
in sixth place after being
virtually knocked out of the
race. The Neapolitan horse
Count Tassia turned-in a
sparkling trial for next Satur-
day’s Cantala Stakes by taking
the Phoenix Handicap in
1.37 1/10, a new mile-record
for the Valley.
* * *
Sydney Horses
Winchester, proving a useful
sprinter for owner-breeder
C. K. Urquhart, added
another win when he defeated
a smart field in last Saturday’s
Rosehill Flying. He upset a
plunge on good Queensland
performer Second Earl, who
had every chance, but was
safely held in the dash to the
post. Stable apprentice H.
Trenear handled Winchester
well, and with experience
could become a leading rider.
While T. J. Smith was in
Melbourne with Travel Boy
and Foxmara his foreman,
“Happy” Rolls, led in two
stable winners at Rosehill, Miss
Gigi in the First Two-year-old
Maiden and Pan Dominant in
the Auburn Stakes. Miss Gigi,
one of the Newtown Wonder
(imp.) progeny, is from Happy
Harvest by Hunter’s Moon
(imp.) from Gold Gleam by
Hall Mark. Happy Harvest
won races on Sydney tracks.
Pan Dominant another
well ridden by a stable appren-
tice, this time H. Williams —
had his win in the 10-furlongs
Auburn Stakes, restricted to
apprentices claiming 71b. (most
of the young lads did a sound
job in this race). Pan Domin-
ant is a three-year-old gelding
by Pan II (imp.) from Koro-
levu by Coronach (imp.).
Though the Smith stable was
out of luck down south, Jack
Green won races at both
Moonee Valley and Rosehill.
Johnno, his Rosehill winner,
easily landed the Welter;
raced by F. H. Edmonds, he
now has five wins to his credit.
Yass, a slightly-built grey
filly by the new sire Rawson
(imp.) from Goddess by Ajax
from Grey Port (imp.) by Port-
law, won at her second start
the Second Two-year-old
Maiden, and in style suggest-
ing that she’ll soon win again.
She’s a half-sister to Harn-
ham Hill, who just failed to
live up to early promise,
running second in both the
Caulfield and Canterbury
Guineas and third in the A.J.C.
Derby. Goddess is a half-
sister to Mayfowl. One of
the oldest and most respected
hands in the game, Bert Mc-
Coy, trains Yass.
• • • •
Lightly-raced three-year-old
Gili won his second race in
succession when he came with
a fast run on the rails to land
the First Parramatta Stakes,
well ridden by apprentice C.
Pearson, who also had the
mount when the colt won a
Canterbury Park Maiden. Mrs.
E. C. McMenamin, wife of one
of the most picturesque riders
of his time, races the Maka-
pura (imp.) youngster, and
Ted himself bred and trains the
colt. A p p 1 a d a y finished
strongly in second place.
• • • •.
Yarrawin —being kept for
easier suburban middle-
distances for the time being—
won his second race from
three starts when he finished
full of running in the Rosehill
October Handicap. New
Zealand-bred, the winner is a
brother to Monte Carlo (now
racing with success in America).
Disappointing Grenoble
finished second ; he goes fast
on the tracks,-but doesn’t seem
able to win with the colors up.
• • • •
Cherry Djust wasn’t equal to
winning a barrier-trial for two-
year-olds, but he recorded an
impressive first-up success in
the midweek Canterbury Park
Maiden for that age-group.
The youngster appeared to be
set a hopeless task nearing the
home-turn, but in the final
half-furlong he smothered the
leaders and won by nearly a
length. He looked at home
on the rain-soaked going, and
he should soon win again.
He’s by Emperor (Fr.) from
Bruena by Brueghel (It.) from
Princess Cadenza by Valais
(imp.). Bruena had thrown
a number of earlier winners,
including High Spot, High
Sovereign, High Prince, Lady
Bruena and Doncaster winner
Fire Dust.
• • • •
Purple Haze, a winner at
Ipswich (Q.), is a smart colt,
beautifully bred —by Smoky
Eyes (imp.) from Tranquil
Dusk by Dhoti (imp.) from
Tranquil Star by Gay Lothario
(imp.). He shapes like one
well worth keeping in mind for
later on.

Last Saturday night six-year-
old Apmat put up a remark-
able performance to win the
Harold Park £5OOO Anniver-
sary Cup from scratch. Losing
ground at the start, Apmat
was actually behind the back-
markers (on 24yds.) when the
field settled-down, and, with
bunching in the last lap, then
made a sustained run on the

24-year-old bank-clerk, he’s
been playing that ball-game
for eight years; won the

the footballers’ Sandover) in
1956, became captain-coach of
Y.M.C.A. in 1957, and repre-
sented W.A. in Melbourne that
year and in 1958. Hitherto he
has had a go at field-sports
during summer, with outstand-

he will naturally concentrate
on basketball, with a court
set up in his backyard. ✓

“Athlete”: There’s nob much
chance of America being un-
seated as the first track- and
field-nation at the Rome
Olympics. Sydney athlete
Geoff Madden, a student at
Modesta, California, in a letter
to N.S.W. selector Alleyn
Gainsford on the recent meet-
ings in Fresno, tells that crack
sprinter Ray Norton was look-
ing from side to side for his
rivals as he ran 100yds. in
9.3 sec. Madden said he
“slouched” to the line. He ex-
pects Norton to smash the
world 100-metre record of
10.1 at the Olympics. The
shot-putters, he said, threw the
shot about like a ball. Parry
O’Brien, world-record holder,
tossed the weight an “easy”
63ft. 3in Four others got
over 60ft., including Dallas
Lang, who’s only 18. Sprinter
Otis Davis, in his first season
on the track, clocked 46.2 for
440yds. Five men cleared 15ft.
in the* pole-vault, including
George Mattos, who was in the
U.S. team at the 1956 Olympics.
“Some of the performances
left me astounded,” Madden
wrote. “The U.S. has terrific
strength in every sprint and
field-game event.”

parking, a practice-field,' bowl-

“K.R.”: Former Rugby
Union Test forward Roger
Cornforth, a big fellow, made
his first century in Sydney
grade-cricket the other day,
some 20 years after his first
grade game —he scored 117 for
Mosman seconds v. Balmain,
with 12 fours and four sixes.
Cornforth, who lost 7st. when
a p.-0.-w. of the Japs (he put
it on again later), represented
Australia at water-polo at the
1948 Olympics and played in
Tests against the 1950 British
Isles Union team. Partnered
with Cornforth for a time in
this cricket-match was another
Union footballer, Kevin Ryan,
of Norths—they added 50 in
14min. together.
“Veryl”: Twice in the
pennant-match between North
Melbourne and St. Kilda the
ball, going at a fair pace,
crashed into the stumps with-
out dislodging a bail! Neither
batsman survived long after-
wards, however —maybe shock.
A North bat cut State pace-
bowler John Edwards hard on
to the off stump, the ball going
through on the first bounce to
the ’keeper. Not out. At the
other end, when Saints batted,
a batsman edged North pace-
bowler Geoff Jinkins sharply
into the stumps. The bail
budged not. Jinkins took a
miraculous 8-0 on a good
wicket against Prahran to-
wards the end of last season.

“Inquirer”: Victor Kelly,
secretary of the N.S.W.
Lawn Tennis Association, a
man who is never satisfied with
letting things remain the same,
has enlisted the aid of the
C.5.1.R.0. and inventor Ted
Both to think-out a device
which can be placed in the
hands of a linesman and ensure
an accurate “call.” Mr. Kelly
thinks that someone with a
knowledge of electronics may
give such an aid to the far-
too-much criticised official. He
also has paint-manufacturers
thinking about producing a
paint that will prevent a line
spreading, and he’s got others
doing research into whether a
white line is the best in marking
a court. On that subject Len
Curnow, the “brain” behind
Melbourne’s organisation of
the 1956 Olympics, carried-
out hundreds of tests to find the
colors that blended perfectly.
Not everyone who saw the
picture the Melbourne Cricket
Ground presented appreciated
the thought that went into the
color-scheme, but some did—
especially the Italians, who
have adopted the scheme for
Rome’s Games next year.
* * *
Three of the Great
“Cremox”: Three of the greatest
cricketers of all time were Trumper,
Spofforth and Turner.
Vic Trumper stands almost alone
as a batsman. His century (in
50min.) out of 130 on a sticky
wicket against Saunders and Co.
of Victoria was one of the greatest
innings of all time, while his 300
not-out v. Sussex in 1899 on his
first visit to England as a youngster
and 185 not-out in a Sydney Test
are other wonderful knocks.
As to trundlers Spofforth and
Turner (“The Demon” and “The
Terror” respectively), each took
over 300 wickets on an England
tour and clean-bowled 200 of them.
Any bowler who gets a hundred
wickets on an England tour nowa-
days is hailed as a national hero.

T>lans for a revolution in the
A U.S. motor industry are
widening and deepening. “U.S.
News and World Report,” an
independent weekly news-
magazine published at Wash-
ington (U.S.A.), notes that the
revolution “is not restricted
alone to the production by the
Big Three [Ford, General
Motors and Chrysler] of ‘com-
pact’ cars. Instead, it involves
a change in the whole con-
cept of the automobile’s role
and its place in the economy.
The turn is back toward pro-
duction of cars designed pri-
marily to meet basic trans-
portation needs.
“In the years since World
War 11, the U.S. auto-industry
ran a race to find out who
could produce the biggest car,
with the highest horsepower,
having the lowest silhouette
and sometimes featuring the
most extravagant fins. Gaso-
line-consumption skyrocketed.
“During the course of this
race the industry sacrificed
most of its foreign market. The
way was opened for a flood of
foreign imports. A new com-
petitor, the American Motors
Rambler, moved in to take 6
per cent, or more of the
domestic market. Studebaker’s
Lark came along to take
another slice of the market.

were marked up year after
year. The auto-industry
appeared slow to realise that
the tastes and needs of its
customers were changing. In
the ‘new-car year,’ starting
now, all this is to be different.
“The big car remains big.
but its price usually is not
marked up. There are some
price-cuts. Customers will get
more for the same money.
“At the same time the Big
Three are coming out with the
first of a growing series of
compact, or economy, cars.
These are Chevrolet’s Corvair,
Ford’s Falcon and Chrysler’s
Valiant.
“In big cars and in the
smaller ones the horsepower
race and the race toward
engines of higher and higher
compression are forgotten. The
emphasis is on a choice of
engines that will permit owners
to use regular-grade gasoline.
Engineers have come-up, too,
with engines that give more
miles per gallon.
“The goal once again is to
meet the wishes of customers
with varying needs and desires.
The goal, too, is to regain at
least part of the domestic
market that has been lost to
foreign imports and to get back
into competition for markets
abroad markets that have
been allowed to go in part by
default.
“In this race all makers now
are producing compact cars.
More are to come.
“All these new cars are
expected to have a powerful
impact on the vast 'automotive
industry, on its wide-flung
merchandising network and on
people’s car-buying habits.
Just how great that impact will
be must remain uncertain until
the customers deliver their
verdict.
“One big question to be
answered is whether the com-
pact cars’ original cost —some
where in the range of $2OO to
$3OO lower than standard-size
Chevrolets, Fords and Ply-
mouths—will attract buyers in
really large numbers.
“Manufacturers themselves
are by no means sure of what
lies ahead. Their forecasts are
in a rather wide range. One,
from Ford, is that one Falcon
will be sold for every three —
or perhaps four —bigger Ford
cars. Another, from Chevrolet,
is that it will sell one Corvair
for every five full-size Chev-
rolets.
“The manufacturers, how-
ever, are ready to adjust to a‘
stampede to compact cars, if
that should occur. They say
it would be no major problem
to divert additional manufac-
turing-capacity to smaller cars,
if public demand goes that way.
“Compact cars are not ex-
pected to shove big U.S. cars
into the background at any
time in the foreseeable future.
There are fully as many big
cars for 1960 as heretofore.
They offer quite as many
allurements as in recent years.”

Angles on Aid
'T'he Manchester “Guardian”
A outlines the advantages
Russia seems to have in the
field of aid to underdeveloped
countries advantages prob-
ably accounting for Khrush-
chev’s wish for more of this
kind of economic competition
with the West:
“Central direction of her
economy is one: recent experi-
ence of industrialisation under
very exacting conditions is an-
other. When India wants, say,
a steelworks capable of pro-
ducing a million tons a year,
Russian engineers are likely
to have constructed something
like it in a district not pre-
viously industrialised several
times before in recent years.
They simply need to adapt
existing plans and do not have
to start from scratch.
“They also seem more con-
scious than Western people of
the political importance to be
attached to the human relation-
ship formed abroad by the
engineers and technicians they
send to the underdeveloped
countries.
“In the minds of the foreign
workers whom they advise or
control, these men create the
image of the nation they repre-
sent. Experience at home has
taught the Russians to be more
patient and tolerant of back-
wardness and inefficiency
than are Western engineers.
‘Brotherly help’ need not
always be a mere phrase; it
often is quite a convincing
attitude. Being accustomed to
simpler conditions of life,
Russians will also fit more
easily into their new environ-
ment.
“These different approaches
are well illustrated by a Swiss
observer’s report on Germans
and Russians in India, recently
published in ‘Der Monat.’ Both
of them are putting-up steel-
works there, the Germans in
Rourkela, the Russians in
Bhilai. (The British are respon-
sible for an even bigger one at
Durgapur, also using some
German contractors.) Neither
of them lives in particularly
attractive surroundings.
“The Germans —about 1600
of them —are irritated beyond

endurance by what they con-
sider Indian inefficiency ; they
shout; they show their con-
tempt ; they prefer to do all
important jobs themselves. The
Russians —only 700 —stick to
their advisory role. Indian
engineers and workers carry
out most of the work and
therefore learn much more.
And the Russians never shout
at them.
“The Germans have their
own clubhouse, hospital, swim-
ming-bath to which Indians
are not normally admitted ; in
fact, they live rather like the
British used to live before
them. The Russians have none
of this. A representative of
Big Brother is watching them,
but they have no political
meetings (the Indian Govern-
ment politely asked them to
refrain), and they do not seem
to miss them particularly.
With the Indians they have
established an easy relation-
ship. Their wives do their own
cooking and shopping, so they
are not troubled, as the Ger-
mans are, by pilfering servants.
“As economic aid increases
in scope, similar conditions are
likely to be repeated elsewhere.
Many of these differences
may, indeed, be unavoidable.
To some extent, at least, they
may be the inevitable result
of different backgrounds. But
they also show that the pro-
vision of aid is not wholly an
economic question.”
The Arab West
/Commenting in L o n d o ii
“Time and Tide” on
General de Gaulle’s peace-
offer to the Algerian nation-
alists, H. M. Nahmad notes
that although the importance to
the West of a peaceful settle-
ment to the Algerian problem
is well understood, “what is
not so generally known is the
place Algeria occupies in the
Arab world”:
“Put in simple terms it
would seem obvious: Arab
nationalists everywhere are
opposed to imperialism, there-
fore it is their duty, so runs
the argument, to oppose the
French, who are the imperialists
in this case, and support the
rebels.
“In the case of Algeria, how-
ever, it is by no means as simple
and as clear-cut as this. For
into it the Arabs have carried
their bitter quarrels, their
rivalries, jealousies and never-
ending disputes. Algeria, in
this context, has become just
another battleground for the
struggle for power and in-
fluence in the Arab world. The
bidder for power is the U.A.R.
President, who is making a
desperate attempt to hold on to
the last shreds of his prestige in
North Africa.
“While Algeria’s immediate
neighbors, Tunisia and
Morocco, have been trying to
persuade the rebels to give
General de Gaulle’s proposals
favorable consideration, Cairo
has been doing all in its power
to urge the rebels to reject the
offer. For President Nasser
knows that a peaceful and
honorable end to the fighting
in Algeria, and a political solu-
tion which would satisfy the
moderate demands of Tunisia
and Morocco (and embrace the
idea of a federation of the
three Maghreb States) would
mean the end of his ambitions
in that direction.
“Much of the credit for the
more hopeful attitude of the
F.L.N. leaders to the de Gaulle
plan must go to the President
of the Tunisian Republic, M.
Habib Bourguiba, who has, in
the past, suffered rebuffs for
his efforts in trying to bridge
the gap between France and
Algerian nationalism. His
position has been a difficult
one. On the one hand was
the wish to avoid a split with
France ; on the other, the claim
for Algerian independence
which could not be ignored.
“The part taken by Tunisia
and Morocco in the recent
deliberations is an indication
of the growing stature of the
Maghreb (Arab West) inde-
pendent States in the’ counsels
of the Arab world. The seal
was set on this by the holding
of an Arab League Confer-
ence at Casablanca in Morocco
last month. Hitherto all
meetings of the league had
taken place in the Eastern part
of the Arab world, either in
Cairo, its headquarters, or at
one of the Lebanese holiday
resorts.
“Although the Maghreb is
joined to the Eastern Arab
countries by ties of language,
religion and a common cultural
heritage, there are many
differences between these two
sections of the Arabic-speak-
ing world. These differences
are natural and spring from
geographical factors and the
process of history.
“It is an irony that while
modern means of communi-
cation, education, wireless and
the cinema have brought die
peoples of the Maghreb and
the Eastern Arab world closer
together in many things they
have driven them apart in
others.”
Hunger the Enemy
TpHE “New York Times”
editorially notes an im-
portant statement made earlier
this month by Paul G. Hoff-
man, managing-director of the
United Nations Special Fund,
to the General Assembly’s
Second Committee:
“Mr. Hoffman had to remind
his hearers that one-billion
people living in 60 member-
nations and 40 territories asso-
ciated with the U.N. are still
carrying-on a struggle against
‘continued acceptance of
poverty, illiteracy and chronic
ill-health.’
“He said again, what has
to be said over and over,
‘that the yearnings of these
people for a better life can


bring a better world or, if their
yearnings are ignored, a world
of mounting tensions and ex-
plosive unrest.’
“What poverty has meant,
and still means, is suggested in
the fact that the best we can
expect this year is an average
per capita income of $l3O in
the substandard countries a
net gain of at most $2 a year
since 1950.
“Population has increased
rapidly, and income has not
much more than kept up. The
result is that the average indi-
vidual in the United States
is many times as well-off as the
average individual in the
typical underdeveloped
country.
“The funds with which Mr.
Hoffman’s organisation has to
work are limited. The goal
this year is $lOO million for the
Special Fund and the technical-
assistance programme. Mr.
Hoffman dares to dream of a
world in the year 2000 in which
‘hunger, illiteracy and chronic
ill-health everywhere can be
the memories of the past.’ ”
But, notes columnist C. L.
Sulzberger in the same paper,
“the job is so immense that
nobody can accurately measure
it”:
“Some U.N. estimates claim
$40,000 million will be needed
over the next decade just to get
things started. But there is no
satisfactory outline of the task.
“To meet this lack certain
influential Americans are now
discussing a dramatic new
approach. They would call
upon Moscow to join us [the
U.S.] in facing the issue on a
non-political study-basis similar
in spirit to the recently con-
cluded scientific approach to
the International Geophysical
Year. Technical co-operation
during the I.G.Y. was superb,
although it coincided with a
nervous cold-war phase.
“According to this scheme,
‘have’ countries, including those
of both blocs, would together
make an inventory of total
world resources and total world
requirements by ‘have-not’
countries. These would then
both be extrapolated forward
on a 10- and 20-year basis. If
the Russians agreed to work
with the West we would end-up
with a basis for planning long-
range aid. If not, we could
at least expose their insincerity.
“One can detect in the
United States a growing aware-
ness of the vast scope of aid-
requirements and of the im-
possibility of trying to tackle
the job alone. In the mean-
time, underprivileged Asia
waits.”
Back to Berlin
'Two questions on the effect
A the Eisenhower-Khrush-
chev talks have had on the
Berlin issue, asked and
answered by Harry Schwartz
in the “New York Times”:
“Can a mutually satisfac-
tory agreement be reached on
Berlin ?
“Premier Khrushchev has
now ended his talk of deadlines
and threats on this matter and
promised to resume negotia-
— N.Y. “Herald Tribune.”
“FOR THE NINTH TIME—NO!”
tions, although when and how
such negotiations will take
place is still unclear.
“But so far he has concen-
trated on promising to give
guarantees against any Com-
munist military takeover of
West Berlin should the area be
declared a free city without an
effective Western garrison as he
demands.
“Yet even if agreement could
be reached on such guarantees
effective enough to satisfy the
West, there remain other
problems. The economic life
of an isolated capitalistic West
Berlin could be slowly
throttled over a period of time
by artfully applied taxes on, or
other impediments to, passage
of goods and persons across
100 miles of East Germany.
“And the city has become a
symbol of Western resistance to
the spread of Communism.
Any move that looked as if it
were a retreat might give the
impression that the West was
backing-down on its opposi-
tion to Communism.
“Will Premier Khrushchev
accept any alternative to his
proposed German settlement ?
“The Soviet leader is asking
a high price on Germany. He
still demands that two German
peace-treaties be signed, with
West and East Germany respec-
tively. This in turn implies a
demand that the West recog-
nise East Germany as a fully
independent, sovereign State.
“There is further implied in
Mr. Khrushchev’s position the
demand that West Germany
negotiate for future German
reunification with East Ger-
many as an equal.
“The West, on the other
hand, is committed to at least
eventual complete German
reunification based upon a
democratic vote of all per-
sons living in both Germanys.
The gap between Western and
Soviet positions here has
obviously not been narrowed
even slightly.”
Writing on the same subject
in the British monthly “The
Twentieth Century,” G. F.
Hudson claims “there is no
good reason for thinking
that Khrushchev has embarked
lightly on the policy he has been
pursuing since last Novem-
ber, or that he intends to
renounce the threat of a new
blockade of West Berlin if he
is not given control of the city
: —or some form of joint super-
vision which can be used to
obstruct and interfere in its
administration.
“What is beyond question is
that after nearly 10 years of
stalemate or peaceful co-
existence—in Central Europe,
following the failure of Stalin’s
original Berlin blockade,
Russia has resumed the
offensive. As long as the
Russians respected the agree-
ment which terminated that
blockade and refrained from
invading the territory of West
Germany, there was peace in
Europe, however unacceptable
to German national sentiment
might be the continued division
of the German people into two
separate States.
“There were conflicts and
crises in other parts of the
world, but in Europe Russia
made no further attempt to
alter by force the status quo as
established in the spring of
1949. Then in November of
last year Khrushchev de-
manded a drastic alteration of
the status quo in Russia’s favor
without offering any compen-
sating concession to the West
and with the threat of a new
blockade if the West did not
accept the substance of the
Russian proposals.
“This is the situation with
which we are still faced ; all
that has happened since to
mitigate the aggressiveness of
the new phase of Soviet policy
is that we have been given an
extension of the time-limit.”
W.A. Wool Scheme

** comment on the “West
Australian Wool Growers’
Voluntary Co-operative Wool
Marketing System,” which pro-
poses to by-pass the auction-
system by offering wool direct
to manufacturers “at stabilised

“By ‘long term’ is meant at
least 12 months. In addition
to this price-assurance the co-
operative society will give a
guarantee as to the quality,

growers in other States to join
the co-operative. If their
efforts succeed, it will result in
less wool being sent to the
sales ; eventually, it could lead
to an abandonment of auctions
if sufficient growers so decided.
“It is, however, roost un-
likely to grow to this extent,
for the practical difficulties are
immense. Who, for instance,
will fix the selling-price for the
hundreds of Wool-types grown
in Australia? Where is the
genius who can say what wool
prices will be 12 months hence?
And what happens to contracts
entered into at prices which in
the course of time prove to be
well out of line with the world
market?
“The truth is that no grower,
whether he be in Western Aus-
tralia, eastern Australia or
Timbuktu, can for long defy
the judgment of the market.
The private buyer will purchase
wool direct only so long as it
suits his book ; as soon as he
discovers that he is paying
more than the world price he
will go back to the auctions.
Producers in South America
have had that lesson driven
home to them more than once
in recent years, and one would
have thought that the hopeful
‘pioneers’ of Western Australia
had been warned by their
example.
“As we have said before,
the auction-system of wool-
disposal has its defects. But
they are not nearly so serious
as some woolgrowers make out,
and a calm appraisal of what
the auctions have done for Aus-
tralia in the last half-century
must lead to the conclusion
that was reached at this year’s
International Wool Confer-
ence — that there is no substi-
tute for wool auctions.”
Dragnet Digest
Manchester “Guardian”:
“The vehemence of Mr.
Khrushchev’s peace-mongering
in Peking is encouraging evi-
dence of his probable sincerity
in Washington. At the same
time, it suggests that he knows
as well as the rest of us that
until now the Chinese Com-
munists —still in their xeno-
phobic ‘Stalinist’ phase—have
been the coldest warriors of
the cold war; and that it is
in their power to freeze-up the
thaw on which he has set his
heart. For Mr. Khrushchev,
although the absolute ruler of
the Soviet Union, is nothing
more than the senior partner
of world Communism as a
whole —and some would even
deny him that title.
“China is the ally of the
Soviet Union, not the satellite.
She does not always toe the
Kremlin line: sometimes, in-
deed, it looks more as if the
Kremlin is toeing hers —and
hers is generally the more in-
transigent. The Soviet leaders,
after all, seem convinced that
a world war would destroy
them; but it is not so long
ago that Mao Tse-tung was
telling us that China was the
only Power in the world with
nothing to fear from the
hydrogen-bomb.”

A London “Financial Times''
diplomatic correspondent: “To
any visitor from another
‘Socialist’ country Czecho-
slovakia must seem like the
promised land and Prague like
the heavenly city. Shops are
full; food-prices, although high
in relation to earnings by
Western standards, are not ex-
cessive—with Czech cooking as
good as ever —and a wide
range of consumer-goods is
available to those able to pay
for them. Prague has retained
many of the outward charac-
teristics of a Western city and
architecturally is still one of
the most attractive of Euro-
pean capitals, as it always has
been.
“Yet it is also a curiously
dead city. There is none of the
intellectual effervescence which
strikes one when talking to
many young Russians. The
vast mass of the population is
politically apathetic, concern-
ing itself with the material
needs of everyday life. The
police is efficient and incon-
spicuous, partly, one suspects,
because it has little to do now.
“If faced with a problem the
Czech will go according to the
book. Probably nowhere in
Eastern Europe has Marxist
orthodoxy been so rigidly up-
held in recent years. A story
current in Prague is of the
Russian soldier who was help-
ing to arrest the Hungarian
Government during the 1956
revolution. Asked by a
Hungarian whether he wouldn’t
like to go back to Russia to
start a revolytion of his own,
the soldier looked round care-
fully and then whispered: ‘Yes
. . . but we are afraid of the
Czechs.’ ”


about the billiards, as I had
seen no evidence of a billiard-
room about the premises.
Out for a little walk one
morning we saw a young
fellow with a bucket, appar-
ently “going a-milking,” but
not quite in the attractive cir-
cumstances so charmingly
depicted in the old song. I
asked him where the billiard-
room was.
He took us to a barn in an
open paddock. Two creaky
doors were prised open and,
in a kind of dusty haze, there,
sure enough, was a full-size
billiard-table. We went to the
rack, but could not find a
cue with a tip on.
“Hey! ” I shouted to the
milk-hand, as he was resuming
his journey to the cow-
paddock. “Where are the
tips?”
“Strike a light,” he said,
“we don’t use tips!”
I had a suspicion that this
might be so, because I had
noticed that the tops of the
cues were mushroomed to the
shape of the heads of well*
used wood-chisels.
“Haven’t you any tips?”
“Too right. I’ll soon put
one on for you.”
He got a hammer and a tack,
and on went the poor little
tip, stabbed through the heart.
It was not at all surprising
that, when I struck a ball, it
described a circuitous and
rocky course that reminded me
of the elliptical billiard-ball
curse in the Gilbert and Sulli-
van opera. I thought if there
were such a thing as a petri-
fied hen-egg, these balls must
have been close relations.
“And what about a piece of
chalk?”
“Chalk?” he repeated in sur-
prise. “We don’t use chalk.
We just damp the end of the
cue and it doesn’t slip too
much.”
We had a bit of fun all
the same.
“Oack with my friend Tom
Mutch, he explained that
he was looking after Henry, as
he had not been well.
Henry later explained to me
quietly, but with a humorous
glint in his eye, exactly what
the “illness” was. He had been
on a “bender,” and a
prohibition-order had been
taken out against him at the
instigation of his friends.
These must have been his true
friends, who did not insist on
his drinking with them every
time they met.
“Tom’s a great fellow,” he
said. “He’s given-up his time
to come to this quiet spot to
keep me straight. You know”
(this very confidentially),
“there is a pub on the other
side that I could get to if I
wanted to. But I wouldn’t
let Tom down. I’m playing
the game as Tom planned.”
Incidentally, this was the
beginning of a two-years’
abstention from drink —a
splendid effort on Henry’s part,
which might have been sus-
tained for a much longer period
had it not been for the careless
indulgence of “friends” who
underestimated his power of
resistance.
One night we were sitting
on the veranda of Allens’,
Another seen in Mel-
bourne “Without Our
Gun.”
swapping stories and strongly
puffing pipes and cigarettes in
the hope of creating a sort of
smoke-screen against an army
of mosquitoes. Now and then
a few managed to dive-bomb
through the smoky haze and
land quietly on their feeding-
grounds.
While I was swatting these,
I noticed that Henry was
placidly smoking away, leaving
the enemy free to explore the
landing-ground for a spot to
enjoy a truly bloody meal.
But soon they all seemed to
transfer their attention to the
more succulent prospects in the
adjoining pastures.
“What have you done to
be exempt from these attacks?”
I peevishly asked
“I’m nicotine poisoned,"
Lawson said.
It was not surprising. Henry
never seemed to be without
his pipe. He stoked-up first
thing in the morning before
breakfast, and still had his
pipe in his mouth when he went
to bed. The only time I saw
him without his pipe was when
he was eating.
Lawson had been quiet for
a few moments. Then he came
out with this: “Apparently the
Mallacoota mosquitoes are
much too much for Mutch.”
I must not leave the impres-
sion that Mallacoota has any
more mosquitoes today than
any other seasidg-resort. It
has been made one of the
most delightful of places for
visitors.
On these evenings on the
veranda of Allens’ we yarned
about one thing and another.
Henry was somewhat deaf, but
he always listened very intently.
I remember telling of a little
bush experience. Knowing (hat
I was a journalist, Henry asked
me if I had written it as a
story. I said that I did not
think I could make it look
interesting enough.
“Do you mind if I use it?”
he courteously asked.
I told him to go ahead.
Tom afterwards explained
that Lawson did not depend
only on his own bushlore from
his experiences for his prolific
output of prose and poetry.
He often picked-up themes
from others and wove them
into the masterpieces which
had made him famous.
Lawson died at the early age
of 55, after a very sad career
in which penury and alcohol
played a regrettable and an
all too prominent part.
COURT HUMOR
The sombre conditions in
which the dignified pro-
ceedings of the Supreme
Courts are conducted
has a tendency to magnify, and
even brighten, every little glint
of humor. The smallest kind
of witticism comes as a wel-
come relief in the usually tense
legal atmosphere.
Sometimes a judge would
brightly break through the
impressive barrier of judicial
formality. In such a case, if
it were a mild joke, we jour-
nalists used to insert in our
reports “(laughter).” This was
thought to be necessary to
indicate that something funny
had been said, because, away
from the legal surroundings,
a joke would lose half its risible
appeal.
But in most cases the
“(laughter)” was quite super-
fluous, as many of our judges
have been noted for their bril-
liant wit, an example being
Sir John Madden. (His eleva-
tion from the Bar direct to
the Bench as Chief Justice was,
however, no joke for Mr.
Justice Hartley Williams, who
had been almost unanimously
tipped by the Bar for the high
position, and when he was
passed over by the Govern-
ment of the day, even a knight-
hood did not assuage Sir
Hartley’s feelings.)
If the laughter in the court
is caused by witnesses, it is
usually at once suppressed by
the Court Crier. This tearly
termed official is not to be
confused with the Court
Mourner who functions in
other high circles “(laughter).”
You see, I have not yet lost
the habit! . . .
Looking at some of the so-
called “comic - strips” in
present-day newspapers, it
would help if an occasional
“(laughter)” were inserted. I
am not very deficient in humor,
but most of these strips of
overseas origin fail to give
me the slightest tickle. There
are others, of course, that
always add to the gaiety of
nations. The strips by Austra-
lian artists are by far the best.
I should be ashamed of my-
self criticising the work of a
few fellow-craftsmen who have
a sense of humor different from
mine, because to have to do
a comic-strip every day must
be a veritable nightmare. I
should be extending to them
my deepest sympathy, and I
can do it now with all sincerity.
But, getting back to my
story, it is the duty of the
Crier to preserve order in the
court. As I knew him, he
would usually keep his eye on
the Bench, and if he saw that
the judge was amused, there
would be no call for silence
from him. If it were from
the barristers’ table, he would
cry “Silence!” only after the
laughter had almost subsided.
But if the source were the
witness-box, his stentorian
“Silence! ” would be very
prompt.
You can see, therefore, that
the court can laugh at itself,
but that a witness may not
make fun of it. The court
must preserve its dignity and
impressiveness to the outside
world. It’s no place for the
witticisms of witnesses.

barristers and audience

'T'he restaurants in modern
ships are nice. You dine
there to avoid the regimenta-
tion of the dining-room, where
there are usually two sittings.
The inmates are summoned by
a trumpeter who plays “The
Roast Beef of Old England”
at both ends of the ship in case
the wind is blowing both ways.
On the last note, hundreds of
God’s creatures, immaculately
gowned, emerge from every-
where.
The food in the restaurant
is superior, the conversation
very genteel, and the atmos-
phere so quiet you cannot
avoid hearing some of the
highbrow chit-chat. For
example, two elderly dowagers
are masticating quite close.
They are dripping with jewels
and old lace and their conver-
sation is uplifting. Let’s call
them Flora and Dora for
brevity, as it would be too
boring to keep on repeating
Mrs. Packenham-Milthorpe.
Flora: Oh, you’re having
soup, dear! (As if she didn't
know !)
Dora: Yes, dear.
Flora : I think consomme
very uninteresting, dear. So
dull.
Dora: Oh! Do you, dear?
Flora : This weather is
rather unpleasant, don’t you
think?
Dora: Yes, dear.
Flora: There’s a name for
it. Mon-something or other.
Something Indian.
Dora : I heard it once. Was
it mongoose?
Flora: (Laughs.) Oh, no,
dear. That’s a smelly animal.
Charles had one when he was
stationed at Gilgit.
Dora: Oh, really?
Flora : Ah, now, what is
that name? I will ask the
steward. (So she asks him.)
Ah, yes. Monsoon, of
course. Have you heard from
Bertie lately?
Dora: No, dear.
Flora: I wonder if they are
related to the Naunton-
Dunderfields of Stony Strat-
field?
Dora : I don’t think so, dear.
Flora: Well! There was a
family—rotten to the core. All
the place mortgaged to the
hilt, and a new Rolls every
Christmas for Marigold.
Dangerous woman. Land a
man in the Divorce Court
before he could get his shoes
off.
Dora : Are you having
pheasant or duck, dear?
Flora: Pheasant, dear. I
always have pheasant. These
modern chickens are so
muscular, they must walk from
one of those impossible places
with aboriginal names.
T ater in the evening, after
fleeing from Flora and
Dora, I encounter the old
General on deck and find him
delightfully pukka, and
although inclined sometimes
to get his vowels tangled in
his uvula, he is otherwise quite
intelligible and, for once, is
almost friendly, so I suspect he
is lonely. Here's how it goes.
General: Hah! There you
are. Have a cigarette?
Me: No, thanks. I like
them with spats on.
General: Lovely night!
What!
Me: I’ll say.
General: You’ll say what?
Me: Lovely night.
General: Rathah! Care

Me: I’ll say.
General: You’ll say what?
Don’t you agree?
Me : Oh, quite.
General : What I say is that
if an officer looks after his men
in and out of the line and sees
they get top-hole treatment,
why shouldn’t he have a bit of
luxury! What?
Me: I’ll say!
General: There you go
again.
Me : Where were you in
the last war, General?
General: By Jove, I came
in for that ferry-ride to Sicily.
Good show!
Me : Did you cross over to
Italy?
General: Good God! Of
course I crossed over; went
right through to Termoli, you
know. Wouldn’t have missed
it for anything.
Me: Wasn’t that where the
Royal Marine Commandos
had to come in and get you
all out of a mess?
General: I’ll say! Damn

For instance, he might cry

This formula would mean
that Jones owed Brown some-

half-a-century old, square

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Wine
As an old (in experience)
toper, I have no great objection
to the current fashion for try-
ing to make everyone a wine-
connoisseur, or to do-it-your-
self advice on how to be a
gourmet. The propaganda for
our wines is skilfully pumped-
out by the industry, and every-
one is happy—that is, almost
everyone.
Twenty years ago I was buy-
ing still and fortified wines
in half-gallon lots from vendors
in and around Sydney. I
used these in my household
for entertainment, enjoyment
and cooking. Today many
vendors offer good low-priced
clarets and near-hocks or
sauternes at keen prices ; but
I buy less than a fifth of the
wine I formerly bought, and
no Australian brandy at all.
Australian brandy, sold by
the bottle, is overpriced and
not in the same street for price
and quality as French brandy
similarly available.
Australian fortified wines
sold over the counter are
particularly unreliable in
quality: they vary constantly
and unpredictably. As for most
sherry sold over our counters,
I concluded 10 years ago that
it’s no more than a rehash
of the blender’s bungling.
Apparently, miscarried ports,
muscats, madeiras, etc., are
rehashed by dilution until
some of the sourness and musti-
ness and incompatibility is
subdued, are then labelled as
sherry and sold to the undis-
criminating.
Our producers, if they are
genuinely interested in im-
proving local sales, must make
an honest effort to present in
single bottles the quality they
so loudly and expensively pro-
claim in their propaganda.
As a buyer or trier, I
couldn’t care less about their
gold medals. Until their show-
and exhibition-awards are
judged in conjunction with
their stock over-the-counter
products which should be
secretly and widely selected by
the judges so that marketing-
policy can be checked against
show-time sincerity—the wine
industry will continue paying
expensive advertising-accounts
which ultimately produce only
diminished \ sales from dis-
illusioned customers who don't
* appreciate huxterism as a sub-
stitute for value.
The presentation of our
table-wines leaves much to be
desired, especially in Sydney
hotels. At one hotel, with its
share of overseas visitors,
wine has lately been served
for dinner after only 10 minutes
in the ice-bucket. That wine
didn’t have a chance! At the
same hotel, although not a
stranger, I was charged 9s: for
a half-bottle of still wine,
before tip. Needless to say, no
tip—it had been anticipated,
and more than handsomely!
This is friendly criticism.
Having bought wines near
Chiltern, Forbes, Barossa and
so on, and having found all
of them good, I’m convinced
that quality should get its
“Don't you think it's time We got back in the Water again?"
reward. If the vignerons put
value into the bottle, the
pounds will look after them-
selves.
Advertising alone is a de-
lusion, especially for those who
must pay for it. With a
population of 10-million, in-
cluding many recent arrivals
of Continental taste and in-
clination, the market is both
clear and assured. It rests on
reasonable quality consistently
available throughout the year.
—D. G. C. (N.S.W.).
If there is one country in the
world that should be able to
grow really good wines it's Aus-
tralia ; and, by any standards
apart from prejudice, wine-
snobbery and all the mumbo-
jumbo that goes with if, we
most certainly do just that—as
™l ne - and -;°° d
S LiH .h, A ~? fa ‘ rly
be said that Australian wines
of various types will stand com-
parison with any.
Wine Week was celebrated in
Melbourne with banqueting,
wine-tasting and so on ; but,
thank heaven, without any of
the nonsensical talk usually
associated with wine in the
older countries of the world—
particularly England. There, we
are confronted with a stone
wall about 6ft. thick, reinforced
with the observations of so-
called connoisseurs who, in
some of the magazines, go into
raptures over Continental
vintages but spare not a word
for wines of the British Com-
monwealth.
Wine-production in Aus-
tralia is steadily increasing and
is now our fourth primary
industry, with an annual pro-
duction of over 11-million
gallons. Much is being done
by judicious advertising to
bring the drinking and appre-
ciation of our wine to its
proper level. The accent has
been too long on “glorious”
beer, and not enough attention
has been paid to the wise words
of old Omar.
For more years than I care
to remember, the retailing of
wine, both by bottle and glass,
has been in the hands of wine-
saloon keepers and licensed
grocers who wouldn’t know a
good claret from sheepdip.
(There are, of course, glorious
exceptions, but not many.)
Licensing Courts seem to be
more concerned with premises
than with a prospective
licensee’s knowledge of wines.
And as far as pubs are con-
cerned, a good knowledge of
football or some other sport
seems to suffice.
Statistics prove that over the
past 10 years Australian wines
have been drunk more and
more, and that we are becom-
ing wine-conscious. This can,
perhaps, be attributed to the
influx of New Australians, par-
ticularly those from southern
European countries, most of
whom are great wine-drinkers.
Let’s hope the time will come
when Australia will be known
as a wine-country and leave
glorious beer to old England
and its thousands of little pubs.
An illustration to conclude
with: Last summer I was pass-
ing a small house in a side-
street of the industrial part of
Geelong (Vic.). Under an old
tree half-a-dozen Italians were
“discussing” a bottle or two of
our wine. There was music and
some singing, and it all seemed
very pleasant. Further along
was the pub. The bar was
packed to the doors and over-
flowed onto the pavement. The
noise was deafening, the atmo-
sphere and language foul, and
the drink being slopped all over
the place was beer. No music,
nothing pleasant, and above
the din a loudspeaker with
much distortion was blaring
out a race-result. My thoughts
turned to the little party up the
street. What a difference!

Australia’s history, short as it is, contains some
remarkable passages.
One which comes into perspective, with
Queensland celebrating its Centenary, is that more
than twice the area that remains in New South
Wales was cut away from it a hundred years ago to
make the new Northern State.
But even more notable than that, in terms of
our national advancement, is that Queensland was
only thirty-two years on from its separate
foundation when the Australian States were
meeting in 1891 in the first of the series of
Conventions that led up to Federation.
The Federal notion had, in fact, originated
years earlier, in inter-colonial conferences, and
councils tracing back to 1883.
So, a mere twenty-four years after the youngest
State was formed, we were on our way to
nationhood. And fewer than forty years after
Queensland’s separation, the new Commonwealth
awaited only the sanction of the Australian people
and the passing of an Imperial enabling Bill to
bring it into effect.
My reason for recalling this here is to point,
in the light of today’s experience, to the necessity
for our keeping ever attuned to the future.
The world is very different from what it was
late in the nineteenth century. Australia is virile
and prosperous, with a population that has almost
trebled since the vote for Federal unity was carried.
In the years ahead the changes will be broader and
longer. For while the pattern has been set for us,
only a fraction of its rich detail has been filled-in
as yet.
We see how swiftly a dissection of Colonies
was turned to fulfilment of the national ideal. And
the turning was made boldly—as students of that
period know —in years that were less kind than
these we are living.
Back there, in the forward-thinking that urged
the wise founders, was the spirit that must animate
each one of us now in bringing our country on to
the still greater future for which it is destined.
y
Australia contributes sub-
stantially).
The puzzling thing is (as I
wrote in some Plain English
items for The Bulletin some
years ago) that although the
representatives of Australian
employers going to the annual
1.L.0. talks have faithfully and
forcefully reported this trend
the Menzies Government has
apparently taken no notice
whatever.
Nothing, of course, ha£ been
said on the subject by that
perennial traveller Albert
Monk, now going 1.L.0.-wards
by sea and contemplating some
difficulties there with other
union men as a result of the
present A.C.T.U. tie-up with
Communists.
But isn’t it time Australia
took some stand on 1.L.0.,
despite our belief that it has
some worth-while accomplish-
ments to its credit? Are we
prepared to accept the com-
promise “Wusslean” mentions,
or to take firmer action? —
Stromlo (N.S.W.).
Fees in Church Schools
If church-school enrolments
are slowly falling because
parents can’t afford the fees
(B. 7/10/’59), why don’t
church-schools adopt the
Gordonstoun principle of a
sliding-scale of fees according to
parents’ income?
At Gordonstoun (Scotland)
one-third of the parents pay
more than average fees so that
the other two-thirds may pay
less. The school has a long
waiting-list, and some prospec-
tive Gordonstoun parents are
willing to plank-down the
whole capital-sum, to cover
five years’ schooling, in order
to get a place in the queue.
If a church-school finds it
hard to carry on without
Government assistance, why
not turn the concern into a
non - profit-making company
registered as a charity? The
most expensive boys’ boarding-
school in England today (basic
fees, £6OO a year) is run in this
way, and it only came into
being in the past 25 years.
Fundamentally a Church of
England school, it receives
pupils from all over the world
—some from Australia. It is
always full, has a long waiting-
list and a first-class sporting
and academic record. The folk
who run it have their eye on
the ball all the time. Only
coeducational at sixth-form
level, it is the only school in
England where riding and
horse-management may be
taken as an extra (20gns. a
term). Many of the senior lads
play polo and hunt.
I have been on the teach-
ing-staffs of several church-
schools in Australia. Prac-
tically all the headmasters I
served under were little more
than rubber-stamps for the
school-council, which invari-
ably seemed to consist of
elderly men with petrified ideas
about education. Many of
these schools have had a long
innings because of the impetus
of tradition. That impetus is
now becoming exhausted and
the dead-weight of the “old
boys” tradition is sometimes
an almost insupportable
burden.
The remedy is not to be
found in State assistance. When
Rugby School (England) was
looking for a headmaster some
years ago to pull it round an
awkward corner, it selected a
man with no previous school
experience. He was, however,
an able administrator, and he
got the school successfully
round the corner. That seems
to me to contain the germ of
a very good idea. — Sir (Q.).
Stockpiling
Stockpiling has been so
much a part of U.S. post-war
economy that Australia might
find it worth studying. The
U.S. has stockpiled for a
variety of reasons: to safe-
guard its defences against
shortages in case of war ; to
bolster prices in some of its
industries ; to create world
stability in some strategic
materials; and to assist its
allies in the cold war.
After nearly 15 years of
stockpiling it’s pertinent to ask
whether Uncle Sam, who’s
always been a pretty shrewd
dealer, hasn’t discovered an
attractive element of profit in
the practice; and then to
inquire whether Australia
mightn’t it even more
profitable to stockpile some of
the raw materials produced in
this country.
There can’t be many minerals
in use today whose value
won’t appreciate considerably
over the next 20 or 30 years ;
and there are some, notably
manganese, which could well
double or treble in value over
that period. There may be
some whose values will stay
as they are, or even decline,
but which are vital in the
event of war. The amount we
might lose on them through
stockpiling would be cheap
insurance.
But there are features even
more attractive than actual


profit or provision against pos-
sible contingencies. A vigor-
ous policy of buying by the
Commonwealth Government
would stimulate the mining of
base minerals and send men
into the outback of a country
already opened-up by the pros-
pector and the mining-
companies.
The Government might
sometimes have to subsidise
by buying above world prices,
but in some cases that’s already
justified. Manganese-producers
are now forced to sell within
Australia, at a price well below
that offered by America, their
entire production up to a
certain level. Only when they
can show proved reserves
beyond Australia’s immediate
needs can they export and get
the price which really makes
the game pay.
It was that incentive which
produced spectacular finds of
manganese in North Westralia
a couple of years ago. Three
companies already producing
manganese staged a battle
which must have strained their
resources almost to breaking-
point, but which gave results
worth any number of gold-
strikes. Some really big
deposits of manganese were
located then —the direct result
of high prices offered by
the U.S.
Our Government could have
got the same results by offering
a price lower than world
parity but considerably higher
than Australian users are pay-
ing now. And it wouldn’t be
losing on the deal.
Assume that it bought, at a
price within range of that
offered by America, the annual
production of manganese above
what is required by Australian
manufacturers. In 20 years’
time, probably less when our
internal demand for the
mineral has increased, as it
will, it could sell what it buys
now at a handsome profit.
If there was every prospect
then that our demands could
be met by annual production
for the foreseeable future, then
the stocks of manganese would
be equivalent to their value in
gold-reserves, and could be
used to balance payments.
Apart from that, the
Government would be stock-
piling a material vital to the
economy of every industrial
nation, and it would be
encouraging the right type of
man to get out where he's
wanted and find out what else
this continent can yield.
That’s probably the most
important aspect. The search
for oil has already yielded
profits for the Common-
wealth, not the searchers —in
the shape of increased know-
“ Absorbing?”
ledge of what lies below a big
part of this country. It has
directly resulted in the dis-
covery, in North Queensland,
of what may be the world's
biggest bauxite-deposit.
A vigorous search for
minerals, which could take
men into all the uninhabited
areas and would attract capital,
internal and overseas, might
yield some surprising finds. It
couldn’t fail to pay big
dividends. Gravelsnatcher

Aid’ for Church Schools
Whilst agreeing with all
“F.G.” has to say in support
of State aid for church-schools
(B. 7/10/’59), I’m surprised to
learn that “their enrolments
are slowly falling.” This may
be true of secondary Anglican
schools in Queensland, but it is
surely not true of church-
schools in other States.
The author of the 1957
“Current Affairs Bulletin” on
the independent schools of
Australia wrote:
Several of the most strongly
established of them now have twice
as many applicants as they have
room for, and in some cases
vacancies are as low as one out of
three, or even one out of four,
applications.
Though this analysis is con-
fined to 58 “independent” well-
known boys’ schools, all but
five of them are church-schools,
and presumably their fees are
higher than those of the lesser-
known ones.

increase of 64.1 per cent. I
don’t know what the increase
for State schools throughout
Australia for the same period
was, but for N.S.W. it was
52.5 per cent.
As “F.G.” says, this ques-
tion of State aid is a “hot
potato,” and politicians are
reluctant to handle it. They
are prepared to recognise
church-school standards; to
agree that they educate at least
half our university-graduates,
and to concede a parent’s right
in a democratic community to
send his child to one of them.
They may even agree that a
church-school has an advan-
tage over a State school, since
it can bind itself to a par-
ticular philosophy of educa-
tion, and that lack of State
aid makes Australia almost
unique in this respect in the
democracies.
However, they also know
that State aid would mean less
funds for State schools, which
need more money for more
teachers, and, since R.C.
schools would be the main
beneficiaries, the ugly charge
of sectarianism.
R.C. spokesmen have been
vocal enough in their claims,
but it seems nothing will be
done until other spokesmen
become equally vocal.
Meanwhile a large number
of parents those with
religious notions about edu-
cation and those who live far
from State schools will be
obliged to contribute to the
support of the State schools,
already overcrowded, which
their children don’t attend, and
to pay fees to the private
schools of their choice. In
short, they will materially
assist the State education-

in my life."
system by not requiring the
State to educate their children.

Economic Leaps Forward
In the first of his series of
1959 Dyason Memorial lec-
tures Indian economist Dr.
Rao argued that India, in try-
ing to bring her economy up-
to-date under a democratic
franchise, faced peculiar diffi-
culties. Previous revolutionary
economic changes had taken
place in societies where the
masses lacked political power
—such as 18th- and early-19th-
century England, and in the
Communist world. In India
political revolution —i.e., the
establishment of a democrati-
cally-governed society had
preceded economic revolution.
In the Western European and
Communist countries exploita-
tion of peasant and worker had
proved a fundamental condi-
tion of the establishment of an
industrialised society:
Exploitation of the workers and
peasants was possible because of
the absence from society of demo-
-cratic freedoms. Involved in all
this was the need for maximum
profit and surplus. In capitalist
society it was called profit; in
Socialist society it was called
surplus. But it meant preventing
workers enjoying the fruits of their
income, which was their due as a
result of increased output.
Dr. Rao’s remarks were apt
as regards India or any other
country faced with the prob-
lem of transforming a society
economically under universal
suffrage.
It is also true that the
industrialisation of England
was achieved when the masses
did not "enjoy the franchise,
Even the mild changes in
voting-strength initiated by the
First Reform Bill of 1832 did
not take place until half-a-
century after the Industrial
Revolution really got under
way. It wasn’t until the 1880’s
that, with the granting of votes
to rural laborers, working-
class males became completely
enfranchised. (Women, work-
ing-class or otherwise, were not
given votes until 1919.)
Applied to Europe in general,
however, Dr. Rao’s thesis is
untenable. In most parts of
Europe revolutionary political
changes preceded economic
ones.
The French Revolution of
1789 convulsed a society that
had hardly felt the first im-
pact of the Industrial Revo-
lution. The class that was the
driving-force behind it the
intelligentsia, of mainly
bourgeois origin, with a strong
leavening of the privileged
legal class —was not a class
made economically powerful
by the new industrial tech-
niques, as were the new-rich
manufacturers of England who
were strongly behind the
Reform Bill of 1832.
The revolutionary disturb-
ances —some of them resulting
in the overthrow of estab-
lished regimes ; others in their
modification—-which affected
most European States in the
first half of the 19th century
took place in societies none
of which had been previously
transformed by the Industrial
Revolution.
Also, Australia, Canada and
the U.S. achieved industrialisa-
tion without serious strain,
under a democratic franchise
previously instituted. Cun-

IDENTICAL TWINS IN DAIRY-RESEARCH
By W. G. WHITTLESTONE
lyy article here on genetics
showed how living
organisms which grow from
a fertilised cell or ovum
have a mixture of factors
from both parents. The
chromosomes of the cells
carry the genes or factors which
decide the nature of the indi-
vidual. The special germ-cells,
ova or spermatozoa, have half
a set each of chromosomes
When the ovum is fertilised
it once more obtains a com-
plete set, half from each parent,
and is called a zygote. I
mention this because twins are
often referred to as morio-
zygotic or di-zygotic, instead
of identical or fraternal.
There are two kinds of twins
—those which grow from two
ova which have been indepen-
dently fertilised, and those
which have grown from only
one fertilised ovum.
Di-zygotic or fraternal twins
are no more alike than ordin-
ary brothers and sisters, and, of
A revised estimate of
Argentina’s wool pro-
duction for the 1958-59
season has been issued
by the Argentine Wool
Federation: the esti-
mate is 3 per cent, up
on last season’s pro-
duction. It was also
stated that as a result
of the exceptionally
heavy flooding experi-
enced during April, the
wool production would
not be greatly affected
during this season, but
would be reflected in
the 1959-60 output.
Australian wool-growers
know that lamb losses
can be greatly reduced
by the safe, sure,
humane method of
Castration and Tailing

course, they may be of differ-
ent sexes. Their inherited
characteristics may be quite
different. They have had
similar environments before
birth, and often have very
similar environments after
birth. This is particularly true
of human-beings, so that twins

which are genetically differ-
ent may seem more alike than
they would have been if they
had been of different ages,
and so had different treatment
at home and at school.
Mono-zygotic or identical
twins spring from one egg;
they have an identical genetic
make-up, and any differences
are due to environment. They
are possible because sometimes
during the growth of the foetus
a splitting takes place. During
the first stages of growth,
the ovum splits into two identi-
cal cells ; these each split into
two and so on, until a great
cluster of identical cells has
grown. If, during this phase,
the mass splits-up into two
chunks, they will go on grow-
ing independently until finally
two identical embryos are
formed.
Sometimes the mass splits
into three of four pieces so that
we get identical triplets or
quadruplets.
During the early phases of
growth the mass has neither
head nor tail, right nor left.
Later it starts to differentiate,
so that the front and rear and
right and left sides are set-out.
When splitting occurs after the
growing mass has become
oriented, so to speak, the twins
will still be identical, but one
will be like the mirror-image
of the other. That is, each
twin will be identical with the
mirror-image of its mate.
Sometimes the splitting
occurs too late, and the masses
can’t separate properly; this
causes a Siamese-twin type of
monster. Another form of
splitting is not complete, so
that part of the embryo is
twinned and the rest is not.
This is the cause of twin-
headed calves or two lambs
with only one head. Another
oddity occurs when the partly
differentiated cells split at
different stages of growth: a
pair of twins and a monster
consisting of a head only is
an example of this.
The important thing about
identical twins is that they
come from the same cell. Their
cause is not known, but, what-
ever it is, it is not inherited
with any strength. Although
the Ruakura Animal Research
Station has had a twin herd
for many years, so far an
identical twin has never given
birth to identical twins. This
is unfortunate because it
makes it that much harder to
maintain a herd of identicals.
On the other hand, fraternal
twinning tends to be inherited.
In human families twinning
often runs for many genera-
tions.
It will be clear from what
I have said that fraternal twins
are caused when two eggs are
fertilised at the same time. This
is due to the mother having
shed two eggs. It is easy to
imagine how this tendency
could be inherited, and it seems
most likely to be inherited
through the mother. I should
say, in connection with identi-
cals, that, while it is most im-
probable that the tendency
is inherited through the mother,
there is some evidence that the
father can have an effect,
though it is not a strong or
common occurrence.
Among cattle in New Zea-
land (where about three-
quarters of the cows are Jersey-
crosses) fraternal twinning
occurs about once in 100 births.
An accurate figure for identical
twinning is hard to obtain, but
it is about one in 1000 births.
So, you see, identical twins are
hard to come by.
The reason why twins are so
important in animal-research
is that all useful domestic
animals breed slowly, so experi-
ments on the relative import-
ance of different factors of
environment are almost im-
possible, because it is not
possible to keep differences of
environment going long enough.
Or, putting the problem
round another way: two herds
of cows, say, on two treat-
ments in numbers large enough
to cancel differences due to
variation between individuals
would need to be so large that
it would be hard to maintain
satisfactory control within the
groups.
There is also the problem of
expense ; large experimental
herds of cows may be costly to
maintain.
The tremendous value of
twins may be gauged from Dr.
John Hancock’s figures for
twin-efficiency. This number
represents the number of pairs
of ordinary cows which may be
replaced by one pair of
identical twins. In a study on
butterfat-production the figure
is 54; for milk-production,
22 ; body-weight, 26 ; growth-
rate, 13. The figures show that
in a study of how cowshed-
management affects butterfat-
production, one pair of twins
should be as good as 50 pairs
of ordinary cows. But would
they?
I raise the doubt because
one fact will at once spring to
the mind of a practical dairy-
man. In a normal fairly large
herd you have a pretty wide
range of types and tempera-
ments of animals; but each
pair of twins is a pair of
animals with identical tempera-
ments, if they have been
brought-up in the same en-
vironment.
Now, in an experiment on


management and production,
temperament will be a tre-
mendously important factor.
In other words, it will be
necessary to have enough twins
to give a sample of types of
dairy-temperament. This pro-
bably means that for such a
study you would need about
10 pairs of twins. However,
this is much better than 50
pairs of animals, and the
results of the study would be
much more accurate.
The reason why twins are
more accurate is because
ordinary pairs of cows have
such big differences between
them, due to their genetic
make-up. In an experiment, the
difference caused by the
conditions being studied
must be bigger than the
differences amongst the
animals on the same treatment.
Ordinary animals start-off with
big differences even under
identical treatments; identical
twins start with small differ-
ences, and this makes it pos-
sible to sort out the influence
of genetics and of environ-
ment.
The immediate appeal of
twins for dairy-research lies in
the fact that fewer animals are
needed, and the results are
more accurate than with
ordinary animals. Particularly
when physiological studies are
being done —where tempera
ment and such complicating
factors are not involved—it is
possible to work with, say, five
pairs of twins and get quite
accurate answers. This is
wonderful, particularly if the
experiment requires surgery.
It’s one thing to fit 10 fistulas ;
it’s quite another to have to
fit 100!
Another great appeal of
identical twins lies in the fact
that they make it possible to
tackle the problem of sorting
out factors of environment and
genetics in production of milk
and butterfat. There’s a lot of
rubbish talked about “Nature
versus nurture,” and breeders
of fancy stock have some dog-
matic, but unsupported, ideas
on the importance of breeding.
At present at Ruakura there is
a very important experiment
using twins going on. It is an
attempt to discover the relative
importance of breeding versus
general management in deter-
mining the producing-ability
of a herd.
In a later article I will tell
about results which have
already been made possible by
using twins. I will also tell
something about the way they
can be recognised, because I
hope some day that the Uni-
versity Farm will be able to
afford to build a herd of
identical twins for studies on
how management affects milk-
secretion.
When we can set about col-
lecting twins I would be very
glad if readers with dairy-
cows would co-operate, be-
cause, in building a herd of
such valuable animals, the
greatest asset is the help of
dairyfarmers. This is a way
in which the man on the land
can help research.
Shearing Technique
“Clancy”: A new technique
in shearing has been developed
by Godfrey Bowen, Chief
Shearing Instructor, New Zea-
land Wool Board, who came
to Australia to demonstrate in
front of Princess Alexandra at
the Melbourne Royal Show.
The technique is designed
to save physical effort by
eliminating second-cuts in the
wool and by holding the sheep
a little closer to the razor. A
nine-man team, using this tech-
nique, has shorn 3156 sheep
in a nine-hour day—Bowen’s
personal total being 405.
Bowen owns a Border
Leicester stud at Levin (N.Z.)
and has written a shearing text-
book, Wool Away.
Danish Red Cattle
Re “Kaytee’s” article on
cattle-breeding (B. 29/7/’59), a
reader has sent in a report on
the Danish Red breed which
he received from a friend in
England, who’s president-elect
of the European Red Cattle
Breeders’ Association. These
extracts should be of interest:
“On our arrival in Den-
mark, Johannes Nielsen, presi-
dent of the Danish Red Cattle
Society, took our delegation to
the bull-station at Toftegaard,
Hillerod. Here we were given
the following information
about Scandinavian Red
Cattle:
Sweden: dual - purpose, big
horned, red and white.
Norway: very dairylike, red,
naturally hornless.
Denmark: dual - purpose, all
horned, but mostly dehorned arti-
ficially. The Danish Red breed
aims are for each cow to yield
11,0001 b. a year at 4 per cent, on
to 4.5 per cent, (many cattle pro-
duce far more than this modest
yield) for three or four lactations;
then slaughter to produce about
7501 b. of good youngish meat,
without fat.
“In Denmark lactations are
quoted for record purposes
anywhere from 300 to 365 days,
but for bull-testing stations
only a period of 304 days is
allowed.
“The whole country is free
of tuberculosis and of Brucellus
abortus. All vaccination is
prohibited; import-control is
therefore very severe.
“Ninety per cent, of all cows
are artificially inseminated.
About 1200 bulls are used to
inseminate perhaps H-million
cows. No steps have yet been
taken to breed naturally horn-
less red cattle, in case the basic
qualities of milk, butter and
beef should be lost or
impaired ; but changing labor-
conditions are making some
farmers consider the necessity
for less individual- attention,
with less labor.
“l ater we visited a heifer-
proving station, where 20
heifers by each of the bulls
under proof were collected
three to five weeks before
calving, all being due to calve
about the same date. Every
heifer has a 304-day test. Tests
for yield and butterfat are
taken on two consecutive days
in every week for the whole
period of the test. When a bull
has been proved outstanding
by such a test, his bull-progeny
out of similar cows will com-
mand a high value. A typical
contract for the sale of a bull
to an A.I. centre might com-
prise :
“At three months old, a
first payment of £5OO upwards 1
in cash ; for each Ist prize at
a show, an extra £lOO cash ;
for each 2nd prize, an extra
£3O cash ; for each 1 st-prize
heifer-group, an extra £lOO
cash; for each 2nd-prize
heifer-group, an extra £3O cash.
After one year at the A.I.
station, a further 2s. a kilo
(2.21 b.) for every kilo over
200 kilos of butterfat in his
daughters at the station.
“The bull-breeder therefore
shares in success long after he
has sold a good bull.”
Lessons from fhe Post
“An Chuidh”: A farming-
society, founded in 1803 in
Forfar (Scotland) by George
Dempster, of Dunnichen, ran
until 1814. Some of the find-
ings of this body, which aimed
at improving agriculture, are
interesting, because they show
how old some modern
methods are and how hard it
is to get other recommenda-
tions adopted.
From the first the society
recommended that no farmer
should employ a hand without
a reference from his previous
employer. It also then stressed
the need for maintaining
superior breeds of cattle and
horses and suppressing weeds.
Rotation of crops was advo-
cated, so that grain succeeded
green crops and fallowing was
dispensed with. Some members
maintained that ground should
be left fallow once in 10 years.
One member was commended
for harvesting 1541 b. of red-
clover seed off an acre of
ground. Cultivation of Swedish
turnips was recommended, so
was the feeding of carrot-tops
to cows, and it was decided that
more wheat should be grown.
Other items discussed were
flax-growing and the use of
gypsum for manure. The
society also pointed out that
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(15/10/’59)
Queensland should have good general rains during
November, with heaviest falls and consequent flooding in
the northern and central coastal areas and the central-
western and south-western districts. Reasonably good rains
should continue in December.
N.S.W. can expect good general rains during November,
with heaviest falls on the n.-w. slopes and plains, central
tablelands, and central- and south-western districts. Flooding
may occur in parts of the State, with reasonably good
follow-on rains in December.
Heavy general rains are indicated in Victoria during
November, with flooding in parts of the State. Rainfall may
vary from moderate to good in December, although the
Mallee and Wimmera districts may be confined to light rain.
Reasonably good general rains are likely in South Aus-
tralia during November, although falls may be patchy and
mainly below normal during December.
The south-western agricultural areas of Western Aus-
tralia should receive reasonably good rains in November.
Best falls should occur in the centre-coastal districts.

animal carcasses could be

By 1808 the society was
advocating the idea of sowing
vetches in drills and draining
marshes. Experiments in
growing kale were reported;
a donation was made to Mr.
Meikle who invented the
threshing-machine.
When the society held its
10th anniversary its member-
ship was 80 —it had begun
with 34 —and formation of
similar societies throughout
the country was urged.
Exhibitions of livestock were
held and prizes presented;
fines were imposed for weeds
allowed to grow unchecked;
drill-sowing of wheat was
recommended, because it gave
one-third more yield than sow-
ing broadcast, and because the
use of wheaten flour was so
important. Drainage was
encouraged, and was largely
effected in the district. Foirin-
grass was considered as a
pasture-and-hay crop which
would give four cuts a year.
Blight in barley was believed
to be prevented by pickling.
Yellow-turnip was declared
better than the Swedish. A
return to the use of oxen for
tillage was suggested.
After the 12th year, the
society did not reassemble.
Dempster had been elected
president for life and was then
over 80, but members of the
society probably believed their
work was finished. The
country, formerly covered with
furze, broom and bogs, was
now drained, cultivated and
free from weeds ; wheat was
largely grown and good roads
were plentiful. Before the 18th
century Scotland was a rich
agricultural land, with good
roads, but the 18th century
found it neglected and covered
with bog. War II was to find
the land in a similar plight and
only heavy subsidies persuaded
farmers to grow wheat, which,
from my observations, seemed
still to be largely broadcast.
So it seems that there are
lessons to be learnt from the
minutes of a farming-society
of 150 years ago.
Wool Disunity
“A.C.T.”: It’s a pity wool-
growers find it difficult to agree
during a time when the scien-
tists are excited about develop-
ments in the use of wool and
in the manoeuvres of its rivals.
Dr. Eric G. Carter, of the
International Wool Secretariat,
London, says that wash-and-
wear woollen material devel-
oped by Australian scientists
is a reply to the challenge of
synthetics, and Dr. Gerald
Laxer, technical director of the
Wool Bureau in New York,
reports that synthetic-fibre
manufacturers are trying to
copy the special natural virtues
of wool, notably “warmth,
drape and softness.”
Yet arguments continue
between growers’ organisations
over matters like marketing,
proposals for a floor-price,
etc. The Federal Government,
understandably, has said it will
consider no proposals, includ-
ing those for a referendum,
until growers are unanimous.
Poll with Poll
“Tabba”: In “South Aus-
tralian Round-up” (B. 2/9/’59)
Don Barkley, of Newbold
(S.A.), is quoted as saying that
Poll Shorthorns will not pro-
gress while breeders mate horn
with poll.
That is true, because a
horned animal can’t give polled
calves. The horned charac-
teristic is recessive, and an
animal with horns is therefore
homozygous, so that its pro-
geny must inherit horns.
If mating a horn with poll
produces a poll, the progeny
has inherited its poll charac-
teristic from the polled parent.
Polled animals may be homo-
zygous or heterozygous, be-
cause the dominant charac-
teristic must show. This means
that if you mate poll with poll,
you may get horn or poll;
but if you mate horn with
horn, you must get horn.
The aim in the Poll Short-
horn world is to breed stock
up to the beef-standard of the
Scotch Shorthorn. If a polled
animal has weaknesses, you can
keep it for breeding. But why
retain a horn, which will cer-
tainly have lost the desirable
beef-characteristics, when it
has no value for getting polled
calves?
At sales in South Australia
I was surprised to see experi-
enced breeders bidding keenly
for homed stock because it
was claimed that they were
“chockablock with poll blood!”
If you are breeding for polls,
don’t dither over horned calves
—cull them!
Fire Precautions
[From “Pieter Xuyts”]
'T'here are indications that
Western Australia is facing
a summer full of fire-hazards.
For a start, the Bush Fires
Board, out to keep damage as
low as possible, has said that
it intends to enforce the law
regarding firebreaks. The Act
gives the board power to insist
on the provision of adequate
firebreaks ; and there’s no limit
to the width that can be re-
quired in a firebreak, since what
might suffice in one situation
would be useless in another.
Irrespective of whether the
regulations are enforced or not,
commonsense dictates the pro-
vision of safeguards. The
ordinary farmer is generally
well aware of how vulnerable
he is, and he usually takes some
precautions. The trouble is
that he’s inclined to be opti-
mistic and sometimes fails to
take into account important
factors.
One such factor —it can be
overlooked —is that fire travels
faster uphill. The heat from
a fire prepares the fuel in front
of it for combustion, and,
since heat rises, fuel uphill
from a fire has a greater heat
directed at it than that below
the fire. A slope isn’t a good
place for a break, but if you’ve
got to make one there,, make
it a lot wider than would be
necessary on the flat, particu-
larly if the prevailing wind
blows up the slope.
Roads can create a sense of
false security. Too often a
country road is just a narrow,
bare strip with prolific growth
on either side. Frequently,
clearing of the road has been
limited to the minimum and
the sides can’t be ploughed or
cultivated, so grass grows at
will, and, instead of a fire-
break, the road becomes a
hazard.
If the Road Board can’t or
won’t burn the roads around
your property, get their per-
mission to do the job yourself
early in the season. Then,
with the break you’re com-
pelled to build round the
inside of your property, you’ll
be sitting behind a pretty good
line of defence. You’ll also
be free of the worry that some
irresponsible will throw a
lighted cigarette-butt out of a
car into tinder-dry grass.
But that won’t protect you
from internal hazards. Given
the right conditions, a hay-
stack—even an old one —can
erupt into flames without
warning, or with very little
warning. If you’re watching
at the right time you might
see a haze over the stack and,
with luck, be able to tear
enough down to dissipate the
heat and beat the full effects
of spontaneous combustion.
(But don’t touch a heated stack
until you’ve got good fire-
fighting-equipment alongside
it.) You seldom happen to be
watching at the right time, so
a stack that erupts into flames
can usually be written-off.
Even if you get the pumps
onto it, what you save will be
spoilt by smoke,
It’s only an occasional stack
that will erupt, so it pays to
space your stacks well apart
and make ample breaks, at
least 20ft. wide, around each.
Then the one that goes-up is
your only loss.
The same applies when a
fire is approaching your pro-
perty. A spark may carry half-
a-mile and lodge in one of your
stacks —and then it helps a lot
if the fire is confined to that
stack. Again, in a wind a
blazing stack sends up a
shower of sparks. You know
pretty well from which direc-
tion you can expect wind in
the summer, so don’t locate

gallon tank that can be slipped
on the back of a truck. There
are plenty of small units on
the market, well under the £2OO
mark but capable of handling
most fires, and they can be
attached to a truck perman-
ently, if necessary. During
summer keep the tank full and
mounted on a ramp from which
you can easily mount it onto
your truck. During periods of
dangerous fire-hazard it pays
to have the tank on the truck
day and night.
About that ramp. The best
idea I’ve seen was a platform
the height of the truck floor,
with the tank resting on pieces
of 3 x IT There were four
pieces of 2in. piping handy,
and it was easy to lever the
tank sufficiently to remove a
piece of timber and replace
it with a piece of piping.
Once the four pieces were in
place the tank could be rolled
onto the truck in about two
minutes.
Finally, look on your pro-
perty for what it is—a part of
a fire-district —and be ready to
co-operate with every other
member of the district imme-
diately a fire breaks-out.
Westralian Woolclip
“Spooks”: When Eric Smart,
of Erregulla Springs station,
Mingenew (W.A.), finished
shearing 46,771 sheep, includ-
ing 9283 lambs, on September
3, 1959, his clip was 1242 bales,
including crutchings. At the
present price of wool this adds-
up to a £lOO,OOO wool-cheque.
Smart’s experiments in farm-
ing have been successful, and
the station at Mingenew is no
exception. All the land these
sheep run on was just waste
sand-plain until he built it up
into pasture-land, and put
most of his money-spinning
flock to graze on it.
The extaordinary summer
weather that has ushered in the
Westralian spring may, how-
ever, make feeding of the sheep
a problem as the months go
on.
The Zebu Cross
[From Michael SawtellJ
Re Samuel Hordern’s article
(B. 16/9/’59) on the history of
Santa Gertrudis cattle in Aus-
tralia, in 1908 I was droving
for old Bill Laurie, the Darwin
butcher, who ran cattle at
Humpty Doo. There I saw
what we used to call Zebu-
cross cattle some people
called them Brahman-cross —
which were the forebears of
the present Santa Gertrudis
breed.
Those cattle were first
"No, it's a horse , put together by a committee."
brought to the ill-fated settle-
ment at Port Essington by
Captain Bremer about 1836.
You may read about the
Essington settlement in Ernes-
tine Hill’s book The Territory.
When the wild blacks drove
them out of Port Essington, the
first settlers left behind them
their Brahman cattle, Timor
ponies and buffaloes.
Port Essington is at the
mouth of the Adelaide River,
which runs into the Arafura
Sea. The old cattle-station at
Humpty Doo, where they now
grow rice, is about 40 miles
from Darwin and 50 miles
from the sea. There is plenty
of grass and water there, but
the country is sour and will
not fatten cattle. However, the
remnants of the Zebu cattle
were crossed with Herefords
and Shorthorns, which were
brought on to the Adelaide
River later.
In my day I used to muster
many of these Zebu-cross,
which were always fat and
immune from ticks. Although
they were rather shy and
would run about a great deal,
I often used to say to Laurie:
“These are the cattle for this
country.” But he would reply:
“They are too small.” So they
were in those days ; they didn’t
weigh more than about scwt.
and put too much beef on the
forequarters, while Australians
like it on the hindquarters.
Their beef was splendid,
though—tender and a bright-
red color, with a streak of fat
in it.
The Americans were smart
enough to cross them with our
beef-breeds and make a new
breed of them. Then we im-
ported them back into Aus-
tralia. Sam Hordern is right
—Santa Gertrudis cattle are
the best beasts for our tropical
North, and the breed is being
improved every day.
Imported Blood
“R.G.8.”: Articles in the
“Beef Cattle Feature” (B.
16/9/’59) and a later one —
“Cattle at the Melbourne
Royal” (B. 30/9/’59)— imply
the need for breeding from im-
ported stock. Heavy reliance
on imported stock seems to
have been accepted practice in
most of our breeds of cattle in
the past. This is supported by
the only scientific analysis of
breeding Australian cattle,
which was made with Jerseys
and reported in the “Australian
Journal of Agricultural Re-
search” in September, 1957.
Several breed - structure
studies have been made in
Britain and the U.S.A. These
have shown that quite a small
number of leading studs, which
are generally closed or in
closed groups, determine the
rate of genetic improvement in
a whole breed. Their progeny
is bought by other studs, which
thus gain the genetic improve-
ment made in the leading
studs.
Such a situation is sound, as
long as everyone is happy with
the type of animal produced.
Looked at another way, it
means that a breeder who con-
tinually buys blood from
another stud cannot hope to
produce animals genetically
better than those he buys. The
same applies to a country
which depends heavily on im-
ported stock to improve its own
breeds. It cannot hope to raise
the genetic standards of its
breeds above those of the
country of origin.
Geneticists point out an-
other factor. In different en-
vironments animals containing
different genes are favored.
This results in breeds becoming
adapted quite naturally to their
own environment. Thus it is
likely that by using imported
cattle in breeding we undo any
adaption to Australian condi-
tions which has occurred in the
past.
Granted that in certain con-
ditions, especially as a result of
inbreeding small numbers,
there is no alternative but to
introduce new blood; but in
most of our breeds of cattle
we have numbers and quality
of genetic material for Aus-
tralian conditions equal to any
we could hope to import from
overseas. The ban on cattle-
importations thus presents no
obstacle to breed-improve-
ment in Australia. Perhaps by
preventing introduction of
climatically unsuited genetic
material our breeds may im-
prove more rapidly.
Farm Hint
“Deter”: When harvesting
melons use a sharp knife or
secateurs. Never pull melons
from the vine, because this
often leaves a cavity where rot
may develop, and because the
vine also suffers damage
through being pulled out of
shape.

From Mrs. J. D. Berry, Box 66,
Keller, Texas, U.S.A.:
I am studying your country, and find
that the climate and rainfall is not so
much different to ours. In our little
town of 1000 people, the local Lions’
Club sponsors an annual country fair;
I’ve been asked to furnish a booth, and
I thought I'd concentrate on Australia.
I would like a small flag, a map and
some literature about your country, and
if at all possible some specimens of
rock and ore, some bright feathers
from Australian wild birds, and maybe
a small pack of flower-seed so that our
garden-club could grow at least a potful
of flowers.

How many different types of
plover are there in Australia ?
Three resident species and two
kinds which breed in northern
Asia, visiting N.Z., mainland Aus-
tralia and Tasmania during the
southern summer. These migrants
include the golden plover (Pluvialis
dominicus), a handsome bird
common on Australian beaches and
salt-marshes from September to
March. The resident species are
the banded plover (genus Zonifer )
and the spur-winged and masked
plovers (genus Lobibyx ). Both the
banded and spur-winged plovers
are birds of the fields, and in some
areas, notably Tasmania, the spur-
wing in particular has become very
common, following restrictions on
shooting. The masked plover is
a tropical species, extending through-
out swampy areas from northern
Australia to New Guinea and
neighboring islands.

Some information on Rotary—
what are its basic aims, and how
many Australian clubs are there '!
The aims may be summarised
in this way: through fellowship, to
promote high standards in business
and professional life and to
encourage the ideal of service in
the community. Rotary is non-
sectarian and non-political; it aims
at suppoiting all worthy charitable
and community enterprises. Being
an international organisation,
Rotary helps in promoting world
understanding; its central office is
in Chicago, and there are inter-
national offices in London and
Zurich. The name originated in
the fact that the members of the
first club met in rotation at their
various places of business or homes.
Rotary was introduced into Aus-
tralia in April, 1921, when a club
was founded jn Melbourne; in May
of the same year a second club was
formed in Sydney, and subsequently
the movement spread to all States
of the Commonwealth. By July,
1955, Australian clubs numbered
274, with a total of 10,932
members; in the following year it
was announced that membership
had increased to approximately
12,000. Administratively, Australia
is divided into five districts, each
supervised by a governor elected
annually.

What is the position regarding
mineral leases in W.A. ?
Mineral leases authorise the
holders to mine for a specific
mineral, or combination of
minerals, to any depth within the
confines of the lease, and convey
the same construction-rights as a
goldmining lease. The initial term
is 21 years, extensible for a further
21 years if required. Except under
special conditions (including the
payment of royalty) as set-out in
the Mining Act, 1904-55, land held
under a mineral lease may not be
mined for gold. Land occupied
as a claim by virtue of a Miner’s
Right may not be leased without
the consent of the holder, nor may
land which is proved to the satis-
faction of the Minister to consist
of payable alluvial ground be nor-
mally made the subject of a mineral
lease. . If, however, a tract of land
has already been worked as alluvial
ground and has been abandoned,
or the Minister is satisfied that
there is sufficient reason for waiving
the exemption, leases may be
granted for areas not exceeding,
* individually, 96 acres. In all other
cases mineral leases may not exceed
48 acres and, where practicable,
must be rectangles of a length not
more than twice the depth. The
labor-conditions provide that a
mineral lease must be manned by
at least two men for the first 12
months, thereafter by at least one
man for every six acres or fraction
thereof, with a minimum of two
men. An annual rent based on
acreage is charged.

(1) What are the characteristics
of talc ? (2) Where does it occur ?
(3) What are its uses ?
(1) A soft whitish, greenish or
greyish mineral. In composition
it is an acid magnesium-metasilicate,
H2Mg3 (Sio3)4, with a specific
gravity of 2.6-2.9. The crystals are
rare, and the massive forms
“steatite” or “soapstone” are . more
common. (2) Up to 1939 the talc
produced in Australia was not of
high grade, and previously all the
high-grade talc required (about
1000 tons per year) was imported
from Italy, Japan and India.
Subsequently the local position
improved, and with increased pro-
duction imports were progressively
reduced in the period following

Sought relief from the hot sultry

His oddly shaped weapons he had placed
by his side,
In close easy reach of his hand,
His daily companions, that he handled
with pride
And with skill, when occasion demand.
No worries or cares warped his keen
active mind,
And the cost of sustainment was small
For he hunted when hungry, like the
rest of his kind,
As he’d learned from the time he could
crawl.
He possessed a sixth sense which lies
dormant in us,
A transference of thought to another.
And although miles apart, he would
often discuss
The events of the day with his brother.
His form of commandments were the
strict tribal law’s,
He adhered to their principles too,
Analysed and compared, proved the
same ones as yours
When accepted from his point of view.
Though he roamed around naked, it
was natural to him,
For it seemd to have been “God’s Inten-
tion,” .
With a mind yet untarnished with
civilised sin,
Or corrupted by modest pretension.

The glory of spring roses—and the
violence of spring storms —were favorite
topics of the week in Sydney. One
became conditioned to wading through
flooded streets, and the mystery of the
elusive taxi that vanishes when pursued
preoccupied many minds especially
those of the wading group! But sun-

Great bowls of the choicest roses from
her garden were used as decorations at
the Stage Club when its director, Mrs.
C. T. Lorenz, presided at the luncheon
given there in honor of Shakspearian
actors John Alden and John Laurie. She
also wore one dark-red bloom at the
shoulder of her magnolia-brocade suit.
There was never a dull moment; the
ready wit of John Laurie made his speech
a sparkling one, while John Alden gave
a convincing reason for the point he
made that more than ever in producing
Shakspeare it is the spoken word that
matters, choreography and stage-settings
being incidental. Fellow - members
helped Mrs. Lorenz make the luncheon
a very bright one. Mrs. Leonard Robb,
of Mosman, was there, also Mrs. Hyam
Owen, of Rose Bay (just back with her
husband, Dr. Owen, from a nine-months’
trip overseas), Mrs. Frank Louat, of
Kirribilli, and Mr. Caryll von Sturmer,
of the Education Department.

Whimsies—one of the happiest notions
to combat the ruinous effects of high
winds on hairdos —were popular at the
premiere of “Hey Diddle Diddle” at the
Phillip Street Theatre on one of the
wildest nights of the year, when heavy
downpours held-up quite a number of
first-nighters. Eye-catching in one of
jewel-red velvet and sequin-dotted veil-

trimmed with velvet bows and worn with
a draped-frock of black jersey. With
her were Sheila Helpmann, elegant in

Bettina Welch, whose American trench-

All the usual fun of a Tivoli show, plus
the gift of a dainty Japanese fan, and a
very delightful backstage-party given by
Producer Tibor Rudas after the show,
came last week with the premiere in
Sydney of “Oriental Cavalcade.” After
seeing the whimsical “kewpies” in their
Swan Lake ballet, it was intriguing to
meet the little Japanese dancers at the
supper-party later and find that, despite
their incredibly slim figures, they
possessed healthy appetites and were
obviously enjoying the novelty of hot-
dogs, with which they topped-off the
spread of poultry, fish, fried-rice and
savories. The Australian “lovelies” of
the ballet looked exceptionally long-
legged by comparison. Dressing through-
out the new show was an outstanding

It was very pleasant to be a guest of
the ladies’ committee of the Australian-
American Association at the Wentworth
last week, at a special press-luncheon
(lovely gift-orchid ’n’ all). The Lady
Mayoress, Mrs. H. F. Jensen, was there,

small feathered cloche was the same
shade of French-grey. Mrs. Jacoby

who contributed in good measure to the
gay chatter around the tables, and the

All the excitement of the Melbourne
Cup will be introduced into the annual
party arranged by the Forget-Me-Not
Committee at Usher’s Hotel on Cup
Day, November 3. There will be sweeps,
special tombolas and other entertain-
ment. Table-bookings and tickets are
available from Mrs. E. Acquare
(FM 6289), and should be arranged as
early as possible, as accommodation is
limited. Proceeds go to funds of the
N.S.W. Society for Crippled Children.

Cup Week begins on Friday, October
30, as far as the staff of the Women’s
Hospital (Crown Street) is concerned ;
an intriguing invitation to the Bar-B-Q
(to be held that evening at Canonbury,
Darling Point) sports an etching of a
racehorse with a grin (and mouth as big
as a hippo’s), and there's promise of
entertainment unlimited on a wine-dine-
dance basis, 10s. admission. Tickets can
be had by ringing FA0477, ext. 49a ;


proceeds will offset expenses of the
garden-fete to be held on Saturday,
November 14, at Lady Wakehurst Hos-
pital, 197 Birrell Street, Waverley, from
11 a.m. until late afternoon.
The combined young-committees of
the Royal N.S.W. Institution for Deaf
and Blind Children aren’t going to be
out of the fun ; they have a Hamper
Canter arranged for Monday night,
November 2, at the Trocadero ; dressing
semi-formal, tickets 10s. each, and
“Bring picnic-supper” is the message
printed on these.
MELBOURNE
There was vice-regal patronage for the
gala-premiere at the Little Theatre of
“Hot Summer Night,” fhe Victoria
League funds benefiting. Lady Brooks,
who accompanied Sir Dallas, wore a
charming ensemble of mist-grey chiffon
trimmed,with pale-blue satin. They were
welcomed by the senior vice-president
of the Victoria League, Mrs. Guy Bake-
well, and vice-presidents Mrs. Robert
Hamilton and Mrs. Frank May. A stole
of pale-pink taffeta highlighted the royal-
blue chiffon harem-skirted frock worn
by Mrs. Bakewell. Mrs. Hamilton chose
a frock of black Chantilly-lace; Mrs.
May a frock of bronze-brown guipure-
lace, the skirt featuring a floating side-
panel. Air-Vice-Marshal and Mrs. Allan
Walters were in the official party, Mrs.
Walters wearing a black-lace frock which
carried a large bow of pastel-pink silk-
taffeta. In the audience were Sir Wilfred
and Lady Kent Hughes, Mr. and Mrs.
Frank Menzies, Mr. and Mrs. M. Sall-
mann, Mr. and Mrs. Maurice Sloman,
Mrs. Ken Hadley, the Victor Nilsens,
Mr. and Mrs. Guy Hume, Mrs. Charles
Osborne, Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton Sleigh,
Mr. and Mrs. Len Voss Smith, Mrs. Roy
Duckett and her daughter Elizabeth,
Mrs. Jean Paterson, Nan Health, Pamela
Middleton and Marjorie Tatnall.

Styles shown by many designers at the
Gown-of-the-Year gala-dinner at Menzies
were good fashion, becoming and most
adaptable. Organised by the Mannequins’
and Models’ Guild of Australia, this
glamorous and interesting night was in
aid of Junior Legacy. Hall Ludlow was
accorded an Oscar for his winning entry,
a full-length coat-and-gown ensemble.
Of white wool, the coat was sewn with
many tiers of wool-fringe. Tiers of
white wool-fringe were also introduced
on the skirt of the gown, which, styled
on Empire-lines, featured a low, rounded
neckline finished in front with a rose of
the material. Halfway down, the skirt
billowed-out slightly and was then
brought-in at the ankles. The coat was
lined with a contrasting lipstick-red
wool. Material for this came from the
textile house of Australaine Fabrics.
Lady Dixon accompanied Sir Owen to
the gala-night, and other special guests
were Legacy president J. E. McKeddie
and Mrs. McKeddie, Mr. and Mrs. E. T.
Bazeley, Mannequins’ Guild president
Mrs. R. Scammell, and Mr. Scammell,
Guild secretary Mrs. Ralph Goodman,
and Mr. Goodman.
A highlight of the overseas trip
enjoyed by Mrs. R. G. Downing, of
Canterbury, was a visit to Rome, where
she and her husband saw the prepara-
tions being made for the 1960 Olympics.
She also visited the U.S., where, she says,
most smart women were choosing
ensembles which combined black and
cinnamon tonings. Paris she found not
as gay and lighthearted as when she was
there in 1952. Mrs. Downing, who is
the mother of nine-year-old twin boys,
is a member of the Mindanao Auxiliary,
which works for the Victorian Society
for Crippled Children and Adults.
Tennis is her favorite form of relaxation.

First exhibition to be held in the Sedon
Art Gallery, Hawthorn, was a collection
of watercolors by Sir Lionel Lindsay.
In opening it Mr. R. G. Menzies, who
is an old friend of the artist, paid a great
tribute to him, both as artist and poet.
Pictures which held this Letter’s eye were
“The Hermitage, Cordova,” sun-drenched
under a brilliant sky ; “Estaminet on
Road to Aix,” a homely touch of which
was the washing draped across the front
of the inn ; and “Spring in the Red Hills
of Spain.” Dame Pattie, wearing an
attractive wool suit in forest-green and
an off-white velvet petal-hat, accompanied
the Prime Minister. Also at the opening
were Lady Angliss, Lady Robinson and
her daughter Mrs. Joshua Pitt, Mrs. F. H.
Wright and her daughter Mrs. Ronald
Marriott, Mrs. Karl Kumm, Dr.
Gladys Hallows, Mrs. Ralph Skinner,
Mrs. George Gardner, Mr. and Mrs.
E. T. Cato, Sir Frank Richardson, Mr.
Ronald Nott, and Mr. and Mrs. H. A.
Challingsworth.

The promenade-deck was gay with
flags and bunting, colored-lights and
flowers for the dinner-dance held on the
liner Castel Felice in aid of the Victorian
Society for Crippled Children and
Adults. More than 200 guests were
welcomed by the chairman of the appeal-
committee, Sir Clifden Eager, and Lady
Eager. Highlighting the buffet-table was
a magnificent model of the Colosseum at
Rome ; and the food, liquid-refreshments
and the services of the ship’s orchestra
were donated by the directors of the
Sitmar Line. The ticket-secretaries, Mrs.
David Warford-Mein and Mrs. Mervyn
Tols'on, were accompanied by their hus-
bands. Sir Henry and Lady Wells were
in a party with the Line’s managing-
director, Mr. A. Bennett, and Mrs.
Bennett, and the Victorian manager of
Sitmar, Mr. H. Sharpe, and his wife.
Among those who attended were the
Geoffrey Tolsons, Mr. and Mrs. Bruce
Selleck, Mr. and Mrs. John Cox and
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Faulkner.

At the Moonee Valley Cup meeting
Lady Brooks was in the vanguard of
suit-wearers. Hers, of ink-blue wool,
featured the new short-cropped jacket;
her pretty hat was swathed with white
chiffon patterned in misty-blue flowers.
Mrs. A. J. Moir, wife of the vice-chair-
man of the M.V.R.C., chose a frock of
black French-wool crepe, a mink stole
and a hat of white carnations. Mrs.
W. S. Cox, wife of the club’s secretary,
wore a smart grey-and-white bird’s-eye-
tweed suit and a hat that was a swirl
of pale-gold silk-straw. A blue-straw
hat with a halo of royal-blue silk bows
was worn by Mrs. Morris Sallmann with
her cropped jacket-suit of ink-blue wool.
Mrs. Mark Clements (just back from a
world tour) teamed a suit of avocado-
green wool and a tiny green hat covered
with matching ivy-leaves. A suit in the
same shade was worn by Rosemary
Keppel with a hat made of rosettes of
white organza and green leaves.

Mrs. Gray Staley, who after holiday-
ing overseas for some months received
the “welcome-home” gift of a new grand-
son, was guest-of-honor at a luncheon
given by Lady Wackett in her lovely
home at Beaumaris. The hostess chose a
slimly-cut frock of old-rose white-flecked
tweed, the bodice cut with a tailored
neckline and joined at the waist with a
basque. Mrs. Staley covered her black
chiffon frock, which was rucked from
yoke to hem, with a black fine-wool coat
which had long revers of black fox-fur ;
her tiny hat was of pale mauve flowers.
Among the guests were Lady Martin,
wearing a brown wool-jersey suit pat-
terned in orange and misty-yellows and
a high-crowned brown velvet hat ; Mrs.
Charles Disney, whose beige tweed
Princess-frock was worn with a grey-and-
white-check coat and beige straw cloche ;
Mrs. Saul Aarons, whose tiny white
lily-of-the-valley cap went with a navy
ensemble; Mrs. John Heath, Mrs.
Robert Young and Mrs. B. Davidson.


“Do you require the first and best
edition, two volumes, 1817?”
“Oh yes, please, I don’t want the
later, smaller issue.”
... . Requiring not to move an inch
from where we stood, I lifted a
cloth cover from a table of books
not on display, took from it a fine
copy of Mariner’s Tonga, 1817, first
and best edition, and placed it in
Captain Lawrence’s unbelieving
hands!
As with most booksellers, Spencer is
most at home with the composition
and dates of books, variorum editions,
etc. His chapter on “Australiana:
Chiefly for Beginners,” and the section
on Australiana generally, is an invita-
tion to the dance which might well
lead the incautious reader down the
rosebud path of collecting; but maybe
there is something to be said, if you’re
going to go gay, for going gay under
sober advice, and what could be more
authoritative than Spencer’s hard-
leamed wisdom?
On the contents of poetry-books,
however, Spencer is not so happy. The
fact that Furnley Maurice dedicated
“The Gully” to him doesn’t make it
the best of Maurice’s works; a be-
nighted Sydney critic would give that
palm to his Melbourne “Odes.” Still,
here one must show some circumspec-
tion —towards the end of his book
Spencer gives us one of the rarest of
rariana: a bookseller’s opinion of
critics, in assessing the first “Bulletin”
critic, A.G.S.: —
Stephens was that excessively rare
thing, a creator - critic. The
ordinary run of professional critic
—literature, art, music—is sometimes
a poor thing, a poseur, a practiser of
the meretricious, a blot on his
calling, one who has sold his soul . . .
New Zealand Poetry
The poems in New Zealand Poetry
Yearbook No. 8, edited by Louis
Johnson (Pegasus Press), are, on the
whole —so far as it is possible to
generalise—more in line with con-
temporary English techniques, more
sophisticated and cosmopolitan than
those we usually get in Angus
and Robertson’s annual “Australian
Poetry”; and at the same time there
are fewer of those rounded, objective
poems, standing quite separate from
the author, which make the best
anthology-pieces.
There is a good deal of that some-
what turgid contemporary imagery
which probably comes from Auden
through Dylan Thomas —
No tourist’s guidebook or geo-
grapher’s chart
To warn of a climate that can cool
or obliterate
The small gyrations of a rough-cast
heart—
(how do you have a rough-cast heart
that can “gyrate”?), usually in the kind
of poem which clarifies an intricate
emotional situation for the author but
less certainly for his readers; and not
so many poems which, like, W. H.
Oliver’s “Autumn Fires” or Paul
Henderson’s “Rain Forest,” come out
specifically to tell us something about
the New Zealand cities or bush.
Still more rare, but existing, are
poems like Marilyn Duckworth’s
witty “Student” (her “Sick Child’s
Window” is another very charming
poem) that give us a portrait of a
person actually living in New Zealand:
All over the coffee shop
Her sleek eyes race,
Like a clockwork mouse, on every
face,
Numbering with her little clockwork
heart
All there is to be had in a coffee
bar ;
and rarest of all is the kind of poem
like James K. Baxter’s slightly brash
but lively “Prize-giving Speech,”
which not only paints a portrait but
tells a story —it is about a school-
inspector who dies while making the
usual prize-giving speech.
Charles Doyle in an introduction
raises the old, sad question, why poetry
does not sell; and, while admitting
that some of the fault may lie with
the poets, whose verses are “esoteric,
obscure, only for intellectuals,” goes
on to suggest that they had all better
“get angry” and write about the
atomic bomb. Heaven forbid! The
atomic bomb is a respectable subject
for poetry, as is a turnip, but it is only
one subject; and a whole anthology of
New Zealand poetry full of synthetic
anger about bombs could only be
dreaded. Clarity, objectivity, subject-
matter intimately related to the New
Zealand scene, and, above all, narra-
tive content—these are the elements
which will help most to restore poetry
to favor.
From that point of view—not for-
getting Denis Glover’s lighthearted
protest at the overcrowding of the
South Pole (“great Sir Hillary’s ice-
breaker jaw”); Gloria Rawlinson’s
accurate and warmhearted picture of
a picnic; Anton Vogt on a sparrow;
and Barry Mitcalfe’s translations from
the Maori (interesting, but not as
appealing as others that have appeared
in “Poetry Yearbook” and “The
Bulletin”)—this reviewer’s choice out
of the whole book would be Kendrick
Smithyman’s “Climbing in the Hima-
layas.” Here is a subject that has
hardly been touched before; one that
is of direct interest to New Zealand
(great Sir Hillary’s ice-breaker jaw
having also been seen in that direc-
tion); one that necessarily implies some
narrative content; and one that, as
Smithyman has handled it the
Abominable Snowman apparently be-
comes a symbol of the primitive in all
of us—has all the intellectual subtlety
to be found in the more private and
difficult poems.
1066 and All That
“Harold should never have lost that
battle,” Philip Lindsay once said
indignantly when he was showing this
reviewer over the field of Hastings;
and indeed it seems from George
Slocombe’s biography William the
Conqueror (Hutchinson) that Harold
shouldn’t have.
It is a question in the first place,
as Slocombe most interestingly reminds
us, whether he had any moral right to
fight it at all; for it seems clear enough,
despite the obscurity of much of the
evidence, that Edward the Confessor
had promised the English crown to
William and that Harold had no par-
ticular right, at any rate of blood, to
the succession.
This is a complicated episode, con-
siderably confused by Great-aunt
Emma, who keeps bobbing-up through
the drama like the Bad Fairy, but, to
make it as simple as possible, Edward,
the son of Ethelred the Unready and
Great-aunt Emma (she was William’s
Great-aunt), was brought-up in
Normandy because Ethelred took him
over there when the Danes drove him
out of England; and, when he came
to the throne, Edward brought back
with him a host of Norman friends and
advisers. Some time in the year 1050
or 1051 William came to visit Edward
—as the English chronicle puts it,
“William Earl came from beyond sea
with mickle company of Frenchmen,
and the King received him, and as
many of his comrades as seemed good,
and let him go again” —and it was
then, apparently, that Edward promised
him the English throne. Edward, for
reasons which George Slocombe does
not explore, was so saintly a soul that
he lived in total chastity with his wife,
and so, naturally, did not expect to
have a direct heir.
It seems clear, again, that Harold
acquiesced in this arrangement; and
that he had been sent over to Nor-
mandy by Edward in 1064 expressly to
reassure William on the point. After
being captured by the piratical Count
of Ponthieu and rescued by William,
he swore fealty with many solemn and

pious oaths, on a pile of sacred
bones.
However, all this was a bit unfair to
Harold. Edward had no business to be
giving the crown away to foreigners;
while Harold, just having escaped from
one French dungeon and no doubt well
aware that there were others in
William’s domains, could be excused
for swearing fealty with reservations.
Moreover, it appears that in his last
days—when Harold, as the Earl of
Godwin, was the most powerful man in
England, commander of both the fleet
and the army—Edward withdrew his
offer to William and named Harold as
his successor. And finally Harold was
duly elected king by the Witan, which
was the proper way for the English
king to be chosen at that time.
But, if his moral right to oppose
William was reasonably established,
Harold does seem strangely to have
messed-up his chances of defeating
him. Obviously the first thing he
should have done, with his superior
navy, was to have wiped-out William’s
unwieldly flotilla of 3000 ships, large
and small, while they were crossing
the Channel. At least he should have
stopped them at the coast. But, because
the seamen had got tired after waiting
four months for William, and the
farmers were anxious to get home to
their harvest, Harold dispersed his
ships and disbanded his militia just
two or three weeks before William
came over.
Harold’s next disastrous step could
hardly have been avoided. He was
threatened at that time with two
separate invasions, the king of Nor-
way, Harold Hardrada, also having
designs on the kingdom; and, just
when the English Harold was reluct-
antly disbanding his militia on the
southern coast, the Norwegian Harold
landed in the north. Harold marched
up to York; brilliantly defeated the
invaders at Stamford Bridge; then
learned that William had landed and,
with his weary and battered forces,
rushed south again to fight him.
But there seems to be no good
reason why, when he was expecting
reinforcements from the north, when
his army was exhausted and when
William was comfortably established at
Hastings, Harold should have rushed
straight into battle. He could prob-
ably have cut William’s communica-
tions with Normandy and chewed him
up at leisure. And even when he had
thus plunged recklessly into the battle,
there still seems no need for him to
have lost it.
The forces, says Slocombe, were
about even, 7000 men on each side.
Harold and his men fought staunchly
all day on their hilltop behind their
locked shields, and might have gone on
fighting for ever had not his undisci-
plined peasant levies three times let
themselves be tricked into pursuing the
Norman knights when they pretended
to run away, and had not, at the last,
the Normans resorted to their famous
device of shooting their arrows high
in the air so that they fell upon the
heads of the defenders, killing Harold
and his brother Leofwin. Even then,
had there been anyone else to take
command, the day—or, rather, the
night—might have been saved, for
when the Normans in their turn dashed
into the forest in the dusk after the
retreating English, there was a
slaughter of hundreds of them in the
ditch of Malefosse into which their
horses stumbled.
As it was, though subsequently
many ill-organised revolts broke out,
the Normans virtually conquered the
whole of England in ten hours. They
rewarded themselves so liberally with
the lands, titles, treasures, wives and
daughters of the English that it is a
relief to read of such gallant efforts of
resistance as that of the three brothers
Thurnoth, Waltheof and Thurman,
whose lands were assigned by the
conqueror to Ralph of Tosny:—
They fought valiantly against the
Normans as they approached, but,
overcome by superior numbers, fled
into the surrounding forest, where
they assembled a small force of
patriots. When Ralph of Tosny and
his men came to occupy their land
the three brothers attacked the
intruders by surprise. They killed
several Normans and set their own
houses on fire before returning to
the forest.
As Slocombe observes in his pre-
face, William the Conqueror “is at
once the most familiar name in English
history and the least-known of our
kings,” and for that reason alone, as
well as for the dramatic story he has
to tell, his biography is exceptionally
interesting. It is not a great work of
history, but it is without fustian and,
in spite of its outlandishly-named
characters and complex intrigues, both
readable and reasonably convincing.
Norman Collins Again
As in “London Belongs to Me,”
Norman Collins has taken the London
scene for his latest novel. Bond Street
Story (Collins), which has for back-
ground a big “emporium” peopled by
characters as rich and fruity as a solid
block of dark fruit-cake. The life-
story of each has the store as its centre
and circumference, and they emerge
with a Dickensian clarity.
One of the central figures is Mr.
Bloot, the senior floor-walker at
RammelFs, who claims he has only to
“Drop ’er nint in the raht quartah” to
advance the employees he likes; who
wears in majestical fashion his tail-
coat and resembles a colonel repre-
senting the regiment at a royal funeral.
His wooing of Hetty is very amusing—
his pompous dignity as a respectable
widower is as crushed by the impact
of her ripe, physical charms as his
knees are by her hefty weight when
she sits on them for a cosy bit of
cuddling.
Mr. Bloot is pathetically bewildered
when, instead of as a kind and ever-
loving wife, she emerges as a chronic
party-giver, a fascinating and perfumed
near-harlot, who just about turns him
into a murderer when she injures his
prize budgies. But Hetty’s philosophy
of life doesn’t admit a hankering for
the respectability of marriage so much
as for convivial company and an
inexhaustible supply of liquor to keep
things moving merrily.
Then there is Mr. Eric Rammell,
the managing director, who always
has a stock of bismuth tablets at hand,
and seeks escape from the relentless
social life forced upon him by his wife
as wearily and constantly as from his
dyspepsia. His attempt to rescue his
son from the clingings of Marcia,
London’s leading and much-married
model, is surprisingly effective as a
cure for both conditions.
There is always much going on at
the store: the summer sales; staff
dance; friction in the hostel; promo-
tions and sackings; publicity-drives that
sometimes go wrong: in fact there is
enough for half-a-dozen novels-
