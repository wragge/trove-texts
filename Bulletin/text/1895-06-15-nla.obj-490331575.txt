THE BRONTE FAMILY.
There was surely never a better illustration of the
generalisation which modern pathologists approach
—the theory which links genius, insanity, intem-
perance, and crime as modes of physical degenera-
tion—than the history of the Bronte family. The
father, though a clergyman, was nothing short of
a murderer —through ignorance or neglect of the
laws of the body. A lusty Irishman, with
insane tendencies, he married a young Oornish-
woman, who seems, though delicate, to have been
normally healthy; and killed her by abuse —if
there is any truth in physiology. The unfortu-
nate creature gave birth to six children in seven
years, and died of physical exhaustion. The
family were all weak and unhealthy, and the son
was vicious. All were brilliantly clever. None
lived to pass middle-age.
# # «
The brutal moral is obvious. To get a genius,
mate a vigorous man, with tainted blood, to a
high-strung nervous woman—or vice versd —and
produce, a dozen children in a dozen years. If
half of them live over puberty, you will certainly
have a genius—perhaps two or three. The more
closely you can tauten these conditions to break-
ing strain—the more nerve-disease you can get
into your subjects without killing them off too
soon —the greater your genius is likely to be.
• » •
The young wife was brought from “ the warm
Cornish sea that was her home”—brought to live
in a parsonage overlooking a graveyard on a bleak
and lonely Yorkshire moor ; and the water for the
use of the family seems to have been obtained from
wells into which the pollution of the graveyard
filtered ! The crazy, tyrannical father always
carried a loaded pistol, which he fired off at ran-
dom when his temper was bad. In this inhospit-
able environment the children withered and died
one by one.
• # •
Maria Branwell (Mrs. Bronte) was married in
1812. She died in 1821, in her 39th year. The
children were :
Maria, died 1825, aged 11.
Elizabeth ~ 1825 ~ 10.
Patrick „ 1848 „ 31.
Emily „ 1848 „ 30.
Anne „ 1849 „ 29.
Charlotte,, 1855 ~ 39.
What a sacrifice ! And the old father, born in
1777, outlived them all. Truly, his life was nour-
ished on their blood !
* * m
The series of Bronte novels is one of the
si.l ongest in fiction. Compare them with Lytton’s,
■or example, and you get at its keenest the strik-
ing contrast between genius and talent. Lytton’s
works are constructed by rule and measure accord-
ing to the best principles of art. They charm and
attract, but rarely move or influence. Charlotte
Bronte, the chief of the three sisters who lived to
write, has a much more limited scope, much less
learning and skill; but her passionate force is
irresistible. Lytton’s characters are only figures
in a picture—correctly drawn, admirably colored,
and arranged according to the best theories of
proportion and perspective. Charlotte Bronte’s
live. They are real personages—we are convinced
of it—painted with the writer’s life-blood, utter-
ing with stress and pang the thoughts which
agitate and overwhelm her.
# * " #
“Jane Byre ” is generally considered Charlotte
Bronte’s best work ; and for variety of power it
takes first place. It is not, however, so har-
monious or so attractive as “The Professor,”
which has more concentrated interest than either
“Jane Eyre,” “Yiilette,” or “Shirley.” It is
noteworthy (did not Lewes first make the
remark ?) that C.B. is least successful when purely
imaginative. Given the smallest base of realism
—some fact, some character she knows—and she
can deduce an endless series of consequences and
characteristics not actually perceived, but vividly
and correctly imagined. Without some actual,
sensible knowledge, her imagination robs her of
verisimilitude and coherence. The force of her
work lies rather in intensity than in extent; her
characters are all kindred, her heroes and heroines
have a striking family likeness.
* # #
Charlotte Bronte had a marvellous power of
observation and analysis, high dramatic talent,
and a gift of keen and glowing language. Hence
she could see the most commonplace personages as
under a magnifying-glass, in all their marvellous
humanity ; and so paint them to the unobservant
multitude. Her insight and executive force
together made her genius.
* * •
Her passion for the outre was a sign of heredi-
tary taint. The normal man loves the normal
woman ; the normal woman the normal man. The
abnormal in either sex—the degenerates of genius,
drink, insanity, or crime—gloat on irregularity,
monstrosity. Hence the perverted instinct of
sexual criminals. Victor Hugo has painted.some-
thing of this in Duchess Josiane. “ Les hommes,
fi done ! un dieu tout au plus etait digne d’elle,
on un monstre.” Doubtless C.B.’s female heroines
display her own character, likes and dislikes.
# # #
“The Professor” and “Yiilette” embody
Charlotte’s experience as a governess in Brussels.
Both are good and clever, interesting and true.
But Shirley is C.B.’s most fascinating character.
The love-scenes with Louis are superb. The force
of genius is in the dialogue: it is like Dumas at
bis best. The rest of the book, though exceedingly
good, is rather too sketchy—there is not sufficient
plot for the incidents, no central thread strong
enough to bind so many gems.
* * #
“ Wuthering Heights,” by Emily Bronte, is an
extraordinary 1 book—crude, without proportion,
yet not without power. There is a good deal of
dramatic talent, but small literary talent; all is
realism, nothing imagination ; and the course of
the narrative is confined. “Agnes Grey,” by
Anne Bronte, describes the experiences of a
governess ; and is graphic enough to interest. It
ends with the heroine’s marriage to a clergyman ;
and three children make home happy. Poor
Anne !
* * *
“ The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,” also by A. 8.,
is a conscientious story intended to show “ the
evils of drink,” and is as dull as most stories with
a purpose. Yet there is a naive truth in all the
Bronte sisters write which makes their books
interesting—close observers and analysts as the
three girls were. The poems by Charlotte, Emily
and Anne are not of first-class merit; and Emily’s
are the best. The others are hardly more than
schoolgirl rhymes, though showing more than
schoolgirlish vigor of thought and language. Mrs.
Gaskell’s “Life of C. 8.” is a tame production,
suppressing a great deal that clashes with “ re-
spectable” notions ; but the interest of the subject
shines through in despite.
The Bronte Novels.

from the “Contes de Lundi ”), and ex-
hibiting a side of the author’s genius not
shown in the “Short Stories ” elsewhere
listed.
A Saint, and other tales, by Paul Bourget.
The “other tales” are “A Gambler,”

limpid method.

The House by the Medlar-Tree, by Giovanni
Yerga.
Gallegher, and other stories, by Richard
Harding Davis.
Balaam and his Master, and other sketches
and stories, by J oel Chandler Harris.
With the doubtful exception of “The
Odd Number,” the stories in this series
are rather recommended by style and
sympathy than by plot or vivid interest.
Davis and Harris have considerable Ameri-
can vogue, justified by their drollery and
perception ; but the average reader finds
them tending to dullness. Yerga, Suder-
mann, and Anatole France employ the
charm of simplicity, not the fascination of
strength and splendour. Bourget’s stories
are lilies, not roses of literature—unless it
be white moss-roses. De Maupassant’s
striking book can be recommended for
general purchase : the others require some
“ acquired taste,” some welcome of appre-
ciative culture. Paper, 3s. each.

COUGHS, GOLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
OHITis AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to
Obtai HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir,—Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, 1 cannot speak too highly of it.
Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—-Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir,—l had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Bistern wick.”

Q URSELVES!
We wish It to be understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely inclusive variety of the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves
PUBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life—honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept Knall profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
never cease from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
gomewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing Humors
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the gieat majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-

ENVY.
He was the first always. Fortune
Shone bright in his face.
I fought for years ; with no effort
He conquered the place.
We ran—my feet were all bleeding,
But he won the race.
Spite of his many successes,
Men loved him the same;
My one pale ray of good fortune
Met scoffing and blame.
When we erred they gave him pity,
But me—only shame.
My home was still in the shadow,
His lay in the sun ;
I longed in vain ; what he asked for
It straightway was done.
Once I staked all my heart’s treasure —
We played—and he won.
Yes, and just now I have seen him
Cold, smiling and blest,
Laid in his coffin—God help me !
While he is at rest
I am cursed still to live —
Even Death loved him best.

If yon love me, tell me so ;

Wait not till the Summer hours
Heap with snow-drifts all the flowers,
Till the tide of life runs low— •
If you love me, tell me so !
If you love me, tell me so,
While the river’s dreamy flow
Holds the love-enchanted hours
Steeped in music, crowned with flowers ;
Ere the Summer’s dreamy days
Fade in Autumn’s mystic haze—
Ere is hushed the music flow—
If you love me, tell me so.
If you love me, tell me so ;
Let me hear the sweet words low )
Let me know while life is fair,
Feel your kisses on my hair.
While in womanhood’s first bloom,
Ere shall come dark hours of gloom,
In the first fresh dawning glow—
If you love me, tell me so !

Dear Bulletin, — In a recent exhaustive
description of Rockhampton (Q.) in Sydney Mail
it is casually stated that the inhabitants are in no
hurry for railway connection with the South.
This is mild ; but it would scarcely suit the Fat-
man of these parts to have the danger pointed out
in more emphatic terms. Look at the facts—and
the map. Rockhampton owes its very existence
to the central railway-line which stretches more
than half across the province. It is the artery
which supplies Rockhampton with its life. Tap
it fully at any point near the coast and the pro-
sperous city starts to slide downward to ruin.
Political influence and the constant strain for
Central Separation can only ward off the danger
for a little while. When the railway commis-
sioners decided that the disconnected section of
the line from Bundaberg to Gladstone was to lie
rusting and rotting through the bush, Rock-
hampton breathed more freely, but the trouble is
merely postponed. It is Gladstone which menaces,
with every natural advantage over the newer city.
Rockhampton lies on a flat about 34 miles from
the sea up a shallow and tortuous river. Over
.£160,000 has been expended on the tricky channel
and a yearly fortune is needed to maintain a pas-
sage. Nearly the whole of Rockhampton cargo is
transhipped on the open waters of Keppel Bay to
the small tenders which take the goods up the
river. The river is practically unnavigable at
night. A little further south lies the fine harbour
of Port Curtis with the apathetic town of Glad-
stone on its deep-water shores. Sooner or later
Gladstone will connect by railway with either
Rockhampton or Westwood—no matter which ;
and then the few wooden inhabitants of this old
town will be bustled into life by the transferred
trade of the great Central line, while the city of
sin, sweat, and sorrow will dwindle into insignifi-
cance.—Jackbird.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply ns with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ THiaiEJIEJ CASTLES ” and “ O^-IPST-A-HST.”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the interest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore; ippeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“ Three Castles” and “ Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

SATURDAY, JUNE 15, 1895.
The “Tote.”
One great cause of the world’s universal
poverty is the vast proportion of useless
non-producers which it- contains, and the
coinpar-atively small proportion of producers.
And, in speaking thus, it is necessary to draw
a sharp line of demarcation between useless
and useful non-producers. The producer, in
the hard-and-fast sense of certain Labor
representatives, is merely the man who sup-
plies the world with food, clothing and
lodging, and a few other bare necessaries of
a plain, gaunt, unpoetic existence the
horny son of toil in his hardest, most horny,
and most restricted aspect. Everyone
else is the non-producer, and is, consequently,
useless and objectionable. But as man
“ lives not by bread alone,” the undeniable
logic of facts makes this simple and beautiful
definition impossible. The artist, the actor,
singer, sculptor, architect, musician, and
writer are all non-producers in a sense, and
all persons whom the world could do with-
out, but if they were abolished or left out of
the scheme of creation, existence would be
so long and lank and utterly melancholy that
it would cease to be worth having. The
middleman, in all his varieties, commercial
and financial, is not actually a producer, and
he has multiplied far—very far—beyond the
world’s requirements, till he has become
a burden and a parasite ; still, in some
sense, and to a certain degree, he is
indispensable. And among others of the
much-contemned non-producing class are
physicians, scientists of all kinds, teachers,
lawyers, parsons, magistrates, Judges, police-
men, legislators, monarchs, civil-servants,
seamen, pawnbrokers, and, in short, almost
the whole of the town and city population
generally. Some of them are mere diseases
—equally useless and objectionable. Pro-
bably three-fourths of the great army of
merchants, dealers, importers, brokers,
agents, shop-keepers and hawkers could be
dispensed with, and the community be all
the better for their absence. The value of
the parson, as he is at present constituted, is
wholly problematical. The lawyer is one-
half the cause and one-half the effect of the
confusion and injustice of the law. The
civil-servant is partly a valuable and essen-
tial member of the community, and partly
an elegant pauper who is billeted on the
country through the influence of his uncle or
some other relative. The non-producing
classes, in short, are, to some degree, the
highest product of civilisation, and, for the
rest, they are an epitome of laziness, fraud
and sin, and to bracket them all together in
one unreasoning malediction is both foolish
and illogical.
Nevertheless, in one sense they are alike.
The actual producer has to support them all,
and the larger their proportion the heavier
becomes the struggle of life to those at the
bottom. Therefore, whoever can invent a
method by which even one non-producer is
abolished, without injury to anything in our
civilisation that is worth preserving, is a
benefactor to his species. And this exordium
brings The Bulletin at last to the subject of
the present article. During the session of
1895, bills to legalise the totalisator in Vic-
toria and New South Wales will be discussed
in the legislatures of those provinces. In
each case the measure is in the hands of a
private member ; and the want of Govern-
ment support, the indifference of many
legislators, and the unholy alliance which
has been formed against the proposal by the
snufflebusters of the community, the be-
jewelled A aeons and Cohens, the sporting
tobacconists, the fraudulent “ tote’’-owners,
and the riff-raff of the racecourses generally,
makes up a strong opposition. Under these
conditions the chances in favor of the Bill
appear decidedly small. Nevertheless, the
legalisation of the totalisator—as a scheme for
the abolition of one non-producing class —is
a move which ought to receive the most
cordial endorsement of all democrats, like-
wise of the Church, the respectable sporting
community, and all the supporters of law-
and-order generally. It should be on the
Labor programme, the Single-tax platform
and the Socialist platform, and be included
in the official policies of Freetraders, Protec-
tionists, prohibitionists, and all other parties,
divisions, factions and scrag-ends of political
humanity. And this paper respectfully
requests all these to give the proposal a fair
hearing, and to help it through in the
interests, not of party but of patriotism.
• # *
The opposition of the pious and pro-
foundly respectable section of the com-
munity is based on three axioms : (1) The
legal establishment of the “tote” is a
recognition of gambling ; (2) gambling is a
sin and a curse ; (3) therefore it should not
be recognised or permitted in any shape or
form. The first assertion is certainly true,
and the second is true, at least in part.
Gambling may or may not be a sin, but it
certainly is a curse. Unluckily, there is no
semblance of a probability that the curse is
going to depart from us. The Social Gimlet
section which demands that it should not be
regulated by law can do nothing to put it
down ; therefore it remains in an unregu-
lated state, and is, consequently, ten times
worse than it otherwise would be. Book-
making is nominally illegal, yet no jury,
magistrate or Judge will do anything of an
effective character to suppress it because the
sense of the community is not with the
Social Gimletists in the matter. “Totes”
are unlawful, yet there are a hundred or more
in Sydney alone, and no one will move in
real earnest to suppress them because the
great mass of the population doesn’t want
them suppressed. Three definite results,
however, have been achieved through the
impotent pretence of prohibition. The
totes are run secretly amid an atmosphere of
blasphemy, obscenity, bad tobacco-smoke
and whisky-breaths. They are all more
or less dishonest, and most of them
shamefully fraudulent, because no one
can sue a tote-keeper for the dividend that
is due to him—because the legal prohibition
naturally throws the work into the hands of
a low and shady class—and because no tote-
keeper can be honest and live, for he has to
buy immunity from the police and detectives
by secret bribes, and he can't make enough
money honestly to bribe enough police and
detectives to secure the aforesaid immunity.
And thus, as a third result, the
totes serve as means to corrupt the
police and detective force, and help to
make it so utterly untrustworthy as to be a
menace rather than a protection. Further,
the law as it now stands has increased the
the number of these fraudulent gambling
machines enormously. They are necessarily
run on a small scale and mostly in obscure
back-rooms, because it is not only necessary
to bribe the “force ” but to keep as much as
possible out of the sight of the Social Gimlet
Brigade which—despite its many faults—is
generally unpurchaseable. Therefore, as
there is a public demand for a vast amount
of gambling facilities, and as each fraudulent
tote-keeper can only supply a limited quan-
tity, the-number of these persons has grown
wonderfully and keeps on growing.
m * *
The bookmaker, the tote-keeper, the fan-
tan shark, and many others, are all evidences
of the great truth that man wants to gamble,
that he will gamble, and that while he feels
that way all the moral and constitutional
law on earth won’t stop him. The only
results of many years of legal repression are
that he gambles secretly amid objectionable
surroundings, that he doesn’t get anything
like fair value ?or his money, that he is a
considerable cost to the citato in abortive
prosecutions and the wages of police and
detectives, and that he gambles as much as
ever—perhaps more than ever. If repres
sion can do nothing better than this, then it
is time to try regulation instead. The fact
that regulation involves official recognition
amounts to nothing at all ; the evil exists,
and everyone knows that it exists, and there
is nothing more to be gained by refusing to re-
cognise its existence than there is by refusing
to recognise the existence of drink or disease
or death or Pahkes, or anything else that is
objectionable. Prohibition hasn’t diminished
the evil ; regulation can do no worse, and
will almost certainly do a lot better.
• • •
Thegambling “industryor, rather, this
one branch of it, for there are many others—
supports a very large number of persons.
The tote-keepers and their agents and
assistants, the bejewelled and diamond-
spangled bookmakers and their assistants
and hangers-on, number many hundreds.
They produce nothing, therefore the pro-
ducing classes have to support them all, and
to support them on a lavish scale. The
maintenance of this garish band costs very
many thousands per annum in actual cash,
and robs the country of many more
thousands which its members might produce
if forced to maintain themselves by repro-
ductive toil. If they and their industry
could be abolished together the saving to the
producing classes would be enormous. As
this particular form of gambling evidently
can’t be abolished, the next alternative is to
have the work conducted honestly and
openly, under proper supervision, and with
as few hands as possible, and the saving will
also be enormous. A legalised tote run at
each race-meeting under the control of the
various Jockey Clubs would extinguish the
great bulk of the bookmaking fraternity, sim-
ply because the machine gives better odds and
always pays up its losses. It would utterly
abolish the unlawful totes —nr 99 per cent,
of them—because the machine which doesn’t
require to pay bribes to police and detec-
tives, and to buy off informers, can always
give better returns than the one which does;
And with one or two totalisators working
openly, instead of a hundred lurking mys-
teriously down back streets, about one per
cent, of the labor would suffice; the crowd of
seedy loafers, hangers-on, blackmailers and
buttoners would evanish; and, of a large, use-
less, and utterly inartistic and depraved
class of non-producers, part w r ould be driven
to some form of profitable toil, some would
drift away to other countries, some would
die off in the congenial atmosphere of the
gaol, and among them all a great burden
would be lifted off the community.
• * «
These are the results which have been
accomplished, or are in process of accomplish-
ment, in those Australasian provinces where
the totalisator is already in operation. And,
in addition to them, the ma dune lias pro-
duced other advantages. With the decline
of the book making business the number of
glaring turf frauds has greatly diminished,
and a branch of sport which was growing
very foul indeed has become somewhat more
honest and reputable than hitherto. The
public gets better returns for its investments,
and the gambling disease is, therefore, less
ruinous, and creates less crime and misery
than it did aforetime. The Jockey Clubs
get a small percentage of the winnings, and
this source of income has enabled them not
only to improve their premises but to offer
largely increased stakes, which make it
worth the while of horse-owners to run for
prizes alone, instead of running to suit the
“ books.” And the Government gets another
small percentage which makes the machine
a source of revenue. In Maoriland tlie
Treasury receives between £lO,OOO and
£ll,OOO per annum from this source. In
Victoria or New South Wales it would prob-
ably net £20,000. All these matters com-
bined make a respectable aggregate reason
why the totalisator should be legalised under
proper conditions with all possible speed.
And, so far as The Bulletin knows, the
only reasons yet advanced against the inno-
vation are that it would destroy the profits
of the gaudy bookmaker—about the last in-
dividual who deserves consideration at the
hands of the public, and that it would be a
recognition of the vice, or alleged vice, of
gambling. And as that vice exists, whether
recognised or not, and exists all the more by
reason of its non-recognition, this latter plea
is hardly worth consideration.
• # •
This scheme for the reformation of turf-
gambling is not here put forward as a great
matter : on the contrary, it is a com-
paratively small one. The £20,000, or so,
per annum which Victoria and New South
Wales would each realise out of the State’s
percentage on totalisator receipts is not
much, though in these days of diminished
revenue and grinding economy even that
amount is not to be despised. Surpluses
nowadays—on these rare occasions when
there are any —have to be made up by pain-
fully collecting together all manner of small
sums, and no Government can afford to miss
even one little item of revenue, which can be
obtained without laying fresh burdens on the
people and thus accumulating unpopularity
for the next general election. Again, the
abolition of the many hundreds of utterly use-
less, and very costly non-producers who run
the present system of turf-gambling would
not be much of a relief to the pro-
ducing classes by whom they, and all other
unproductive workers or loafers, have to be
supported ; yet it would be a relief. Even
if one man who now does no useful work—
who does nut help to.enrich or refine or
enlighten or improve the community —call
be compelled to employ himself for a liveli-
hood in some occupation of value to the
nation, there is something gained. The
present unsatisfactory state of society can’t
he put right, by any one measure, no matter
how wise or beneficent it may be ; it bas to
be patched and amended by hundreds and
thousands of instalments, and no instal-
ment, however small, is to be despised.
Therefore The Bulletin urges that the
Totalisator Bill should not be killed by in-
difference because it is a comparatively
small matter, or sacrificed to superficial
snuffle as heretofore. The evil with which
it deals is only one among many, but it is a
very veal and urgent evil none the less.

gives prominence to :
- PROTECTION V. LAND TAX.
To The Editor of The Age.
Sir, —We are told by Freetraders, Single-taxers, and
some misguided Protectionists that we should lower pro
lective duties, abolish revenue duties, and make up Vhe
difference by a land-tax. Are we not now making great
rejoicing over the fact that we are increasing our export
of natural products? Yet what is the result ? It is only
an experiment which must take Lime to prove its success
and develops into a proper undertaking. It does not pay
sufficiently now', or there w’ould be more capital and labor
employed in it. Yet what are our anti-Protectionists
trying to do? To kill our export-trade altogether. if
exporting beef, mutton, butter, &c., is not now suffi-
ciently remunerative to induce a flow of capital to such
industry, how will it be when a heavy impost is placed
upon land? Why, this will simply prevent any profit
being made out of such liade, and it will be abandoned.
If we pay for our imports by our exports, we must make
the conditions for exporting such that we may gain and
not lose by the transaction. Mr. Trbnwith anil others of
the Labor-party see this clearly enough, and it is lime
they discarded the land-tax cry which they have adopted,
I feel certain, because it has been made popular without
being understood. —Yours, &c.,
2Sth May. Protection Understood.
This is the shriek of the one-idead maniac—the
fatuous fanatic who goes about with a plank
and calls it a bridge. He labors under the delu-
sion of all such faddists—that the solution of
the social problem is simple, not complex. On
the banks of Yarra, Melbourne may bear any
Sunday another saviour of his country who
declares that a diet of apples and nuts, com-
bined with deep-breathing, is the one certain,
remedy for all physical, social, menial and t
religious evils. The Bulletin does not deny -
the saving grace of apples and nuts and
breathing, and it has been at particidftr.

Financial Responsibility.
Some particulars of the Victorian Companies
Bill, to he introduced this session by the Tur-
ner Government, are now available, and, so far
as they go, the measure looks promising. They
are summarised as follows :
The Bill makes it imperative that half the shares in a
company shall be subscribed for and half the subscribed
capital paid before it can he registered. Actions for the
recovery of forfeited snares must he commenced within
one year, directors may purchase forfeited shares for a
company at the amount of the due call, no liability com-
panies are pronibited from holding shares in another com-
pany, the directors or officers of a no-liability company
receiving money on deposit are personally liable for the
amount, but the liability will not pass to executors ; com-
panies and societies must publish oertifled statements
twice a year of their assets and liabilities, directors must
keep properbooksof accounts,and the manager must verify
the balance-sheet by a statutory declaration. Power is given
to appoint special auditors. Companies are prohibited
from lending money on their own shares, and advances
made to directors must be filed with the Registrar-
General. It is made a penal offence for a company to
publish a misleading statement of the amount of its
capital. Dividends must only be paid out of profits, and
if this is contravened the directors are to be personally
liable for the amount illegally distributed. They are also
prevented from making a first or any issue of shares at a
premium until the company has been established at
least 12 months. No new companies are to be
permitted to use the words “savings,” “savings
bank,” “bank,” “banking company,” “banking
house,” “banking association,” or “banking institu-
tion." Increased restrictions are imposed on mort-
gages or assignments on the uncalled capital of a
company. The Registrar-General is to be informed where
branch registers are kept, and the shares must be dis-
tinguished from the principal register. Foreign com-
panies must register the names of their agents and situa-
tion of office. Power to alter the objects, form or con-
stitution of a company is subject to confirmation by the
court, which may also order, on a resolution of the share-
holders, capital to be reduced. The promoters or
directors of a company are held responsible for an untrue
prospectus under which it is formed, whilst it is a mis-
demeanor to make a false declaration with a view of in.
dueing persons to take shares. Promoters are also liable ■


to pay compensation to the person or persons imsle d
by a false prospectus. In connection with the winding-
up of companies directors are prohibited from becoming
liquidators, and if it is proved that any promoter, director,
manager, liquidator, or auditor has misapplied the money
or property of a company, the court may assess damages
against them. The powers of liquidators are strictly
defined, and the almost impregnable position they at pre-
sent occupy is removed by bringing them more under the
control of the law.
These provisions make it certain that—provid-
ing the bill gets through—there will be no
more alleged “banks” in Victoria with £lOO
or so paid-up capital, or with a paid-up capital
which consists mostly of the p.n’s of the
promoters, who are also the managers and
hold their own “securities” for safe cus-
tody. Also, it will make it certain that
the shareholders won’t he all men of straw,
and will prevent company - mongers dazz-
ling the public with that bogus security
■which comes of the announcement that the
.capital is £4,000,000, of which £500,000 is
subscribed and £25,000 paid up. Still, despite
the many good points in the measure, there
seems to be something wanting. Directors are
to be liable for dividends paid out of capital,
. a nd for money lost through misleading prospec-
tuses, and the books are to be properly kept,
; and the balance-sheet officially verified, and a
large number of other things of much value are
to be done. But when they are left undone,
;aud the directors are hauled before the courts
; as a consequence, the Bench will probably
.decide, as usual, that they were not left undone
within the meaning of the Act.” And where
(the Act says that directors and promoters are
tto be responsible for dividends wrongfully paid,
.or for money invested on the strength of
misleading prospectuses, the law will doubt-
less decide that this means they are respon-
sible if they had a criminal knowledge of the
wrongfulness of their own actions at the time
they were committed; and as no man can abso-
lutely prove what another man knew or didn’t
know, the same old snag will get in the way
again. Considering that every influential Vic.
bank-wrecker up to date was held by the law to
have no guilty knowledge of anything, under
any circumstances whatever, this difficulty is
serious. The shortest way out of it would be
to enact that directors, promoters and managers
shall be assumed to know what they are doing,
like other people, and that when one of them,
while in his sane mind, commits an illegal act
he shall be criminally responsible, whether lie
.knew he was committing it or not. This
proviso wouldn’t be nearly so brutal as it sounds.
‘When a man picks another’s pocket in the
.street, the law always assumes that he knew he
,was doing it. And when a man does the same
jin a bank, the law could assume the same thing
vwithout any injury to its sense of justice.
Prisons and Criminals.
lEditor Bulletin, —Your scheme for the reor-
ganisation of our prison system would, if intro-
duced under present conditions, work splendidly
jin theory, but in practice would be a dead
Ifailure. Whv not go to the root of the evil and
make a code of regulations and general orders
uinder which gaol-warders can discharge their
duties with humanity to prisoners and benefit
to the community ? It is not the system that
is altogether at fault, but the harsh treatment
imposed on warders by the regulations, which, in
many instances, make them irritable and unfit to
properly maintain good discipline. Let me give
two instances of many. First, warders (I speak
of New South Wales gaols) perform long
hours of constant duties, from 12 to 14 a day,
which is sufficient to sour the temper of any
man and make him indifferent as to his sur-
roundings. Should a warder be absent on
account of sickness, he must pay a substitute
ffis. fid. per diem to do his duty during his ab-
sence. This is justice with a vengeance, con-
sidering that a 3rd-class warder, who receives
;Bs. per day, most likely has to support himself
.and family on the balance—ls. fid. Second,
.should a warder need a holiday to recoup his
(health, he must pay a substitute and all his
.expenses to and from his destination ! In fact,
(those men are the worst-treated of all Govern-
iment employes, and yet we don’t hear the self-
sstyled democratic Labor-party ever raise its
woice in protest. Let gaol officials be treated
like men. The imprisoned should be governed
by the free, not by men who themselves are
practically imprisoned. —J ustice.
The N.S.W. Lead-Poisoning Regulations.
When Parliament essays the task of protecting
labor against the unscrupulous or careless
employer, there should be an exact understand-
ing as to the measure of protection wanted.
When that is settled, the resultant act or regu-
lations should crystallise the needed safeguards
in terse, unmistakeable English. At Broken
Hill the mineowners, it was complained, took
insufficient precautions for the prevention of
lead-poisoning; therefore, the local member
piloted through the Assembly an amendment to
the Mining Act authorising the issue of regula-
tions, which, when subsequently issued, were
based on the recommendations of the Lead
(Commission. Said regulations are an eminent
.example of what such a code ought not to be.
It has been found that the regulation which
practically prohibits the employment of boys
under 16 inflicts needless hardship in scores
of cases without commensurate benefit.
Although the drafters wisely made it illegal to
work in certain situations without a respirator,
they were silent as to who was to provide the
respirators, and the mining co. s have evidenced
a curious partiality for workmen who buy their
own. The clauses dealing with clothes-chang-
ing, the supply of drinking-water, &c., are
meant well, but are couched in pain-
fully deciepit English, which obscures their
meaning and probably renders them legally im-
potent. One clause describes several systems
of supplying drinking-water in lead-infected
neighborhoods. But the “ shall ” which would
make one at least of these imperative is varied
in places by the semi-optional “ should ;
the plentiful use of the conjunction “or in
the one long sentence into which the descrip-
tion and directions for application of the several
systems is massed, allows the mine-owners, if
they wish to be on the safe side and adopt one,
to take which they like. Finally, as if to
.cuoure that the water-supply clause shall
be a dead letter, it winds up “or the
miners may take into the mine tea
or water in cans,” &c. The trail of
the lame and halting “should” is, in fact,
all over the code. There is to be a bath and
changing-room caretaker, “ and it should be
part of his duty ” to do certain things. Then
there is a puzzle, not as to the meaning of
“ should,” but as to what the drafters intended
it should mean, which even an interpretation
clause could not settle. Every underground
workman “should” change his clothes before
descending to, and on coming from, work —one
regulation says. Another decrees that certain
other workmen “ shall be under the same obli-
gation to change before going on shift as under-
ground hands.” Yet there is no obligation in
the first instance—or if such was contemplated,
is the recalcitrant workman who neglects to
conform or the mining co. to be held liable for
breach of the regulations ? Revision is urgently
needed.
The Relics of the Star Chamber.
A Bulletin correspondent: Is it generally
known that the Privy Council is simply the
dregs of the Star Chamber, that it is all that
was left of that institution after the Long Par-
liament wiped it out as far as England was con-
cerned. An institution hateful to the English
freeman, obnoxious to English liberty, but good
enough for “ His Majesty’s colonies and planta-
tions!” The Judicial Committee of the P.C.
still preserves a good old Star Chamber tradi-
tion. Its judgments (by the way, not judg-
ments at all in form) are concocted in secret;
no one knows whether all the Judges have
agreed or whether there may not be two out of
five dissenting. This reduces immensely the
value of their decisions, for the opinions of
three nincompoops go out to the “colonial”
world as though they were the opinions of five men.
The 'personnel of the P.C. has been much im-
proved of late. But still it is far from perfect,
even from the purely legal point of view. The
English courts treat its decisions very cava-
lierly, even the puny Divisional Courts showing
no hesitation in over-riding them. The Council’s
imperfect acquaintance with Australian institu-
tions has resulted in bringing about an undesir-
able sense of insecurity in regard to the Torrens
system of land-transfer, which will become
worse when the system is adopted in England
and the weighty Court of Appeal begins to play
ducks and drakes with the P.C. dicta. The
absurdity of the system cannot be too often or
too strenuously pointed out. A batch of Judges
(the really able members of the batch deem it
infra dig. to be present) selected in a haphazard
fashion (till very lately), trained mostly on the
lines of English jurisprudence (the most insular,
bigoted, and narrow of all), sit as a final court
ofappeal to determine the subtlest questions of
law that can arise among nations of ages
varying from Noah’s to yesterday’s, some of
whom have lived under custom for centuries; and
adjudicate at the same sittings on questions of
English, French (old regime), Roman, Dutch,
Danish, Maltese, Spanish, Turkish, Maori,
and ancient Norwegian laws, to say no-
thing of Hindoo, Parsee, and Mahomme-
dan customs, and colonial admiralty appeals.
A more unwieldy and unsuitable contrivance
for dispensing justice to the most heterogeneous
peoples ever known in the history of the
world cannot be imagined. The Romans
early gave as good a supreme Judge to
their subject peoples as they had for them-
selves, and, as a result of the work of this Judge
(the praetor peregrinus), an almost perfect legal
system was evolved —which was respected by
the Romans themselves, and, in fact, afterwards
superseded their own. But our P.C. is not
respected by either Englishman or “colonial.”
A case in point is a recent decision on the law
of negligence, in which a Melbourne tailor and
his wife were, unfortunately for themselves, the
leading figures. The decision in this case is the
laughing-stock of all writers on negligence, and
the shuttlecock of every tinpot court in England
and Ireland. It is not even clear whether it
binds Australia, for an eminent English
Judge dismissed his consideration of it by
contemptuously remarking that it was only
binding on the Supreme Court of Victoria.

Tue Midland Railway Shindy.
The biggest legal fight and the biggest bill for
law-expenses which any Australasian Govern-
ment ever encountered will probably eventuate
in Maoriland re the famous Midland Railway.
The situation regarding that disastrous and
crooked scheme—drawn up by Stout and Vogel
in their frantic efforts to resuscitate the dead
boom —is altogether remarkable. The co. has
received, as bonus on the work already done,
land to the extent of several hundreds of thou-
sands of acres. It made four widely-severed
bits of railroad, which, unless completed, are of
little use to anybody. Then it stopped work, and
demanded cash instead of land, and, by the
stoppage, the land already granted was, to a
great extent, made a dead loss. The co.
threatened to drag the Govt, into a huge and
expensive litigation over its “ claims -or into
an equally expensive arbitration. I iually,
Govt, seized the line already built under the
terms of the contract, and now it is in an inte-
resting situation. There will be an enormous
amount of law over the matter. If Maoriland
loses, it will have to pay a massive bill of costs
and heavy damages, and then it will have
to go back to the old deadlock, and have
another big litigation, or arbitration, over the
co.’s “ claims.” If it loses there also, there will
be more costs, and another big bill for damages ;
if it wins, there will also be costs, and the co.
will probably remain on strike, and leave the
work in its present unfinished state, and after
all the sacrifices that have been made to get the
Midland line there will be no Midland line
after all. On the other hand, if the province
wins the first case, and thus asserts its right to
seize the unfinished railway, there will still be
costs to pay ; also, the nation must find the
money to finish the line if it is to be of any
value in opening up the country, and when it is
finished there is very little probability that it
will pay its way for the next 10 or 20 years.
There isn’t much to win if the couutiy does
win, and though the contract looks too explicit
to allow of any question, still the law is such
an anomalous kind of mule -Unit it -is just as
likely to lose. No legal document eau be made
so explicit that anyone can rely on it with
absolute confidence.
Dear Bulletin,— What is the matter with
“Government by the workingman for the woik-
ingman ?” Looking at the question from a
Socialist standpoint, I see no difference between
it “and Government by the people for the
people.” Latterday economists give to Labor
the natural produce of Labor, to every man
according as he produces. Surely this is ground
enough for the doctrine that the brain and hand
workers are really the people. The Labor-party,
as far as its name goes, is wide enough to include
everybody, from Jimmy Tyson to his station
cook, since all say, I suppose, that they
labor for their bread. There is nothing
in the constitution of the N.S.W. Labor
League to prevent a bank-director joining
it; it is not an association of manual
laborers —it is an association of workers. I admit
that the hob-nailed superstitionprevailsamongst
Labor-leaguers—as in S.A. It is a relic of the
time when a prominent plank of the Labor -
party’s platform was that it should not wear a
pot hat. But it is fast disappearing ; and the
most ornamental member of the present New
South Wales Parliament is a prominent and
trusted Labor man. Anyhow, the idle class are
responsible for the superstition. While they
consider it ungentlemanly to soil their hands
with honest toil, or to speak to a shabby
acquaintance in the street, so long will the virile
democracy of Australia thank God it was not
born a gentleman. — Railway Man.
It is alleged by their enemies that certain
Sydney solicitors have touts among the gaol
warders, who are employed, upon commission,
to persuade those prisoners entitled to money
from the Grown for their defence, to employ
the attorneys whom they represent. But this,
even if true, is no valid reason for the Crown s
pleading lack of funds, postponing the prepara-
tion of a capitally-arraigned man’s defence
until the first day of sittings, and then handing
the prisoner’s neck over to the care of an un-
paid sucking barrister, who, as Justice
Innes put it the other morning, needn’t attend
unless he chooses ! To Mr. Justice Simpson (in
the days of his Attorney-Generalship) is due
the credit of having first provided funds for
the defence of capitally-arraigned moneyless
prisoners. The system plainly has the approval
of his no less humane judicial colleagues, and
The Bulletin hopes that Attorney-General
Want will not bring about a rever-
sion to the old and cruel system. And
why should not their Honors emphatically
refuse to try any undefended prisoner capi-
tally arraigned ? Who would dare to blame
the Judge who, under such circumstances,
declined to hear the Crown Prosecutor ’ Upon
such matters the Judges should speak out loud.
Here is the Crown—which actually pays for
carriages and cabs to convey the members of
tlie N.S.W. Bar to vice-regal levees and spends,
say, £13,000 in erecting a statue to gaoler-
Governor Phillip '.—pleading “ N.S.F.” to
applications for the money necessary to defend
moneyless citizens on trial for their lives !
The fiscal attitude of the New South Wales
Labor-party is incomprehensible. The party
demands that the local worker should be com-
pelled bv statute to work only eight hours per
day, and that a respectable minimum wage
should be fixed. Then it demands that
he should compete on even terms with men
who work 10 or 12 or 14 hours a day for less
which is not commendable, but only
illogical and foolish. ihe short houis and
the minimum wage are Protection for the
foreign competitor; every artificial restric-
tion = placed by legal enactment upon an
industrial rival”is Protection, and this only
differs from the ordinary kind because it is
protecting the other man against us, instead of
protecting us against the other man. And if
the New SSuth Wales worker doesn’t protect
himself against the foreigner, as well as protect
the foreigner against him, then he is obviously
handicapped out of the race in every industry
that is open to foreign competition. The party
that thinks it can have higher wages and
shorter hours than anybody else, and yet com-
pete with everybody on equal terms, is expect-
ing a great deal.
Francis Abigail (just released from prison) and
Dr. Violette (surgeon to the gaol at Parra-
matta) affirm that N.S.W. treatment of juvenile
offenders simply breeds criminals by starving
them into incapacity to earn an honest livmg.
This they have seen with their own eyes. The
Comptroller of Prisons (who is the chief sup-
porter of the GouLD-gag) denies the charge. As
his denial must be based chiefly on the reports
of his own officials, it is worth little. It is
worth less still when one considers how fond
gaol-officialdom is of considering its own con-
venience the measure of right; how it is
tethered by red-tape ; how apt it is to regard
prisoners as blocks of wood, to be knocked into
shape with axe and mallet; how warmly it re-
sents outside interference with its methods.
The Bulletin is quite satisfied that Ur. Vio-
letta and Abigail speak the truth. The
N.S.W. gaol-system must be modelled by the
men at its head. These have been shown to
have neither heart nor brains ; and their system
must be like unto them.
Jos. Symes got a “not guilty ” verdict in the
criminal libel-action brought against him, but
has been imprisoned for 14 days by Chief
Justice Madden for contempt of court. That
is a trifle ; gaol is a fine place for reflection, and
the Liberator (how in its 11th year) will get
on all right for a fortnight. The tall, lank
Joseph— “ a man of sorrows ” if ever there was
oue _ u tters a hope that he has now seen the
end of his troubles. The Bulletin sincerely
hopes he hasn’t, for Australia can’t spare the
combative old atheist, who is, in his way,
almost as obstinate as the bigots he
attacks, but whose career is such a
monument of industry and talent used
with single-purposed sincerity that one glows
in contemplating it. For some 20 years
now, in season and out of season, with good
taste, bad taste, and no taste aLall, Jus. Bvme.
has been doing every day of Ids life three men *
work with tongue and pen to spread the truth
as he knows it, the light as he sees it. He ha-
fought continuously against calumny and mis
representation; the defection of friends and the
attacks of ~open and secret enemies ; private
affliction and public scorn ; frowns, pity,
and laughter. He has been poorer than.
Job all the time, his Liberator is hardly
ever out of the valley of the shadow of
death, and just now he badly wants £5O to
pay rent and taxes and give him a fresh start.
Such a man can only reach the end of his
troubles in two ways. One is to stop struggling
and float with the conventional stream. lie
other way is that painted in the magnificent
close of the magnificent “ Beauchamp s Career,
when the great Lord Romfrey stands thunder-
ing on the beach to direct the search for the
bodv of the drowned Radical, whose life has
been so pathetically fruitless, so grandly unsuc-
cessful. Perhaps the end of Jos. Bymes troubles
may come when a long, loose-jointed corpse with
grizzled hair and furrowed face is found floating
on the peaceful bosom of the Yarra, to receive
as guerdon and epitaph the title which
Heine chose for himself — “A Soldier in the
Liberation-War of Humanity.”
The assertion that the present low price of
candles in New South Wales is owing to the tall
in tallow, and not to Protection and the conse-
quent increase of local supplies, is knocked end-
ways, or partially so, by the following tact.
During ’B4 and ’B5 the price of tallow in Europe
fell from £37 to £24 per ton, but the importers
ring which bossed the Sydney market kept the
price steadily at 9d. per lb. Ihen, in 86, the
protected local industry started and prices
straightway went down with a thud to b.jd.
They have since been further reduced. From
this it appears that reductions in the price of
raw material don’t necessarily mean a reduction
to the consumer so long as the importing ting
has control of the market; also, that Protection
does make t hings cheaper —sometimes. Yet if the
duty is taken off the importer can, and probably
will, sell at 5d., or even less, per lb., until he
has extinguished the local maker, when he will
shove the prices up to the old level once more,
and during the fivepenny period there will be
much joy over the cheapness which comes
through Freetrade. The gist of the thing is
that the imported Freetrade article would
generally be cheaper than the local protected
one if the importer would sell as cheaply as he
can—which he won’t, except under compulsion,
and never will do unless his “ ring is burst up
by local competition. And the whole 4 reetra.de
doctrine of cheapness is built on the assumption
that the importer does sell at the lowest pos-
sible rate—which he doesn’t; and that he
doesn’t form rings to keep up prices—which he
does ; and that it is only needful to show that
goods can be lauded in Australia more cheaply
than they can be locally produced, quite ignor-
ing the fact that they never are landed at that
price, or anything like it, until the pressure of
local competition begins.
The Tichborne story told by Walter Lee, of
Glebe, seems to throw a suspicion of light upon
the origin of Orton’s imposture, and Jean
Ldie’s incidental perjury. Walter Lee gives
us an Osprey schooner as an actual fact. He
sailed on it from Adelaide to Melbourne in
July, 1854; believes that a young gentleman
passenger was Roger Tichborne, and that
one of the crew, called Arthur, was Orton.
The young gentleman landed at Geelong, went
on a prolonged spree, and was reported to have
died. Jean Luie was never aboard the Osprey.
The merit of Lee’s yarn is its moderation he
doesn’t protest too much. It sounds like a
probable explanation of many things difficult
to account for in the Tichborne trial evidence.
If Roger took to Geelong whisky and died, or
was murdered, there is ground for supposing
that he may never have written home. If
Orton knew of Roger’s life and death at Gee-
long he had at least one dead-bird in hand
when he started to shoot for the Tichborne
stakes. Also, if Orton and Castro sailed on
the Osprey from Adelaide, where Walter Lee
joined the ship (always assuming that Lee
hasn’t persuaded himself to imagine the exist-
ence of the craft aforesaid), it is possible
that Orton was one of the crew of the
Osprey at Valparaiso, or some other
port, where Roger, escaped from the
wreck of the Bella, came aboard. Which
would explain the apparent honesty of Jean
Luie’s evidence in days of yore. Orton had
loaded him up with facts, not fiction, and Luie.
was merely lying as to bis own personal con-
nection with the Osprey. Lee’s suggestive
reminiscences of that much-doubted schooner
are as well worth acceptance as the Claimant’s re-
cent “ confession.” The wily Fatman has doubt-
less confessed frankly enough everything that
happened from the time when Lady Tichborne’s
advt. came to his ears, but he may have denied
all knowledge of Roger in the fifesh for reasons
often hinted at during the famous trial and
since. The editor of the paper that published
Orton’s confession is inclined to credit Orton
with a knowledge of Roger Tichborne. He
has cross-examined his man, and found the con-
fession rather shaky on its legs, maybe.
Rumored that Frank Cotton, ex-M.P.,
will be amongst the next batch of N.B.W.
M.L.C.’s.
Scandinavia now proposes to take over all
private railways and make them a State mono-
poly. Fvery country comes to that sooner, or
later. “Either the country must own the railways
or the railways must own the country.”
Victorian Labor-members should have a
few words to say concerning the £2500 “bunce”
which Hopetoun is drawing as an absentee-
Governor during these last six months of his
engagement. If a sick Treasury is to provide
£5OOO for vice-regal exs. between March and
October, the cosmetiqued Chief Justice Madden
might as well have the whole amount, instead of
half, in which case he would probably be content
to forget his collateral salary as Chief Justice.
'The existing arrangement is a sweet satire on the
Government retrenchment policy. Lord Hope-
toun goes “Home”.on half-pay for six months—
£2soo, whilst Madden draws £2500 for imper-
sonating the missing earl, x>lus £1750 of judicial
wages.

“ La Cigale ” is doing one week of im-
mense business at the Lyceum, by way of winding
up the operatic season. There have been more
operas crowded into the present season than were
ever put into so short a space of time before, by
way of showing Nellie Stewart in as many differ-
ent aspects as possible before that favorite starts
in the track of the setting sun for the foggy land
of Bull. Next Friday will be the very last night
of Nellie before she quits this bereaved continent,
and, by way of leaving the brightest possible im-
pression behind her, she is playing the rather un-
satisfactory part of Marton with even more than
her usual brilliance, and “La Cigale’ is doing a
much wilder boom than its own rather slender
merits deserve. Miss Nellie was announced to
take a benefit in “ Ma Mie Rosette” on Wednes-
day, and with true benevolence the gross proceeds
are to be handed over to the poor of Sydney, so
it Is Nellie’s benefit in name only. In recognition
of which kindness The Bulletin hereby gives
three cheers, and would give more if its speaking-
voice hadn’t been affected by the weather.

The alleged Gaiety Co., after a brilliant
dazzle in Melbourne, which has reduced the
scanty remains of the local johnnie-dom to imbe-
cility, opens at the Lyceum on Saturday with
“A Gaiety Girl.’’ The rush which ensued when
this was known nearly swept “the Finn ” off its
four feet, and the circumstances were so desperate
that it was found necessary to sell the seats for
the first performance by auction. If the plan had
been opened at Nicholson’s in the usual way a
large number of persons would assuredly have
been killed in the rush, and Nicholson’s stock
would have been trodden underfoot and utterly
wrecked ; and when the dead were removed out
of the ruins W. and M. would have been tried
before Judge Windeyer, and convicted late on a
Saturday night under the capacious hanging laws
of N.S. Wales.

Bartley Campbell’s Californian drama,
“My Partner,” ends at Her Majesty’s to-night
(Thursday), after a run of only five nights. This
unfortun ite suddenness was forced on the manage-
ment by previous arrangements, which is to be
regretted, for Bartley Campell’s hero is a manly,
upstanding individual, with whom every person
possessed of anything like a soul must feel in
sympathy, and, though Mr. Rignold is struggling
with an aggravated influenza, he makes the charac-
ter deeply impressive. The funny man is a China-
man, and, as a Chinaman has no dignity to lose,
he doesn’t look such a melancholy spectacle as
anybody else would under like circumstances.
Moreover, Tolano makes an artistic Chow, and,
when he bowls out the hard-faced iniquity of the
story, he does it on logical grounds, which the
funnyman seldom does. Besides, his pathetic
devotion to the distressed girl with the blind
staggers, and the infant that she didn’t ought to
have, is a pleasant feature in his character. The
bad man, who is responsible for the infant, has
many redeeming traits about him, and, the audi-
ence feels, with a glow under its waistcoat, that he
would have put things right if the much-worse
man hadn’t prematurely dug a knife into his spine.
The play is ingeniously constructed, and G. Rig-
nold lies so magnificently to get the girl with the
infant out of a tight place, and so joyously hangs
the man who possesses her miserable secret and
wants to give it away, and shuts down with such
vigor on the Roman parent when he attempts to
make the oration which the disgusting heavy
father always makes to his daughter under such
circumstances, that the audience feels good
towards him all round. The prodigal daughter
has come home in so many dramas, and been
thrown out into the rain by her corrugated parent,
that it is a glorious thing to see that parent shut
hard down upon just as he is beginning his weary
old harangue about the disgrace which has come
upon his escutcheon, or his coat-of-arms, or his
clothes-trunk, or something.

Miss Amy Roselle and Mr. Arthur Dacre
open at Her Majesty’s on Friday, in “ Esther
Sandraz ” —a powerful play, new to Sydney audi-
ences—and “ A RpgularFix.” The Bulletin has
already had occasion to speak in high terms of these
two artistes, and they ought to fill even G.R.’s capa-
cious theatre. Miss Roselle proved in Mel-
bourne that her great English reputation was
fully justified, and Dacre is a versatile actor,
who covers a deal of ground in more ways than
one. The pair have brought with them a number
of plays new to Australia, including “ A Wife’s
Ordeal,” by G. R. Sims, “A Bunch of Violets,”
Sardou’s “ Scrap of Paper,” and the above-men-
tioned “ Esther Sandraz.” There should be a big
house at G. Rignold’s theatre on Friday night.

Miss Maggie Moore continues doing her
“last weeks” at Sydney Royal, and “Sweet
Innisfail ” is keeping up well—partly by reason of
Oily Deoring’s process-server, for whom this paper
has conceived a lasting affection as the most
capable and original process-server it knows.
This person’s shape, which is altogether unpre-
oedented, seems to he arrived at by wearing a
brick in his pants, and an unabridged dictionary
on his back, and a large knob of coal inside his
vest. Anyhow, a strong desire is growing up to
have him surgically inspected, on the ground that
he looksjike a camel which has been mashed by a
falling gum-tree. •*>.

The Empire (formerly the Opera House)
fills considerably of late, and seems likely to take
root in the great soul of the public. There are
two or three attractions at this house. Banvard’s
“Leap from the Dome” is a thrilling episode
which makes the onlooker feel as if the door-key
had gone down his back, and the trapeze ant is a
bone-shaking performance. Miss Ada Colley’s
singing is something worth listening to and think-
ing seriously about afterwards, and some of the
blushful maidens of the 00. are very fair to look
upon.

Sydney Tivoli is adorned this week by
Harry Gibson, “the great battle-axe juggler,”
who throws some altogether new lights on the
weapon with which Copeland, M.L.A., wanted
to demolish Reid’s majority. Horace Wheatley
and James Norrie leave at the end of the week
for London, their bleeding country having de-
manded that they should immediately return and
take up new engagements at immense salaries.
* * * m
Miss Maggie Moore gives a matinde at
Sydney Royal on June 19 to raise funds for the
defence of George Dean, and Mr. Rickards will do
likewise at the Tivoli. As justice is an expensive
commodity, it is to be hoped the cash results will
be handsome.

At the auction of seats for the first night
of the Gaiety Cos., at Sydney Lyceum, Mr.
Barney Allen, the metallician, bought the first
box submitted for’ten guineas.. Seats in the d.c.
realised as high as 245., and good positions
averaged, probably, 11s. Most of the front seats,
where a full view of the co.’s beautiful legs could
be obtained, were purchased “regardless.” But
the function was not what it should have been.
The auctioneer, Mr. Henry Gorman, as befitted his
early career as a Methodist Church office-bearer,
left all the color and poetry and dazzle and frill
and legs out of jus discourse. The “ Firm ” ought
to have hired* Joe Tolano for the occasion at a
high salary, and furnished him with an auc-
tioneer’s licence, and let him discourse at large
about the Gaiety girls, and the understandings
thereof, and cheer on Moses and Abraham and
Isaac and Jacob to destruction by bursts of poetry.
An auctioneer of the solemn, corner-allotment
variety is utterly lost under such circumstances.

Susan’s Rebellion was promptly put down
at Melbourne Princess’s, and on Saturday the
8.8. management staged “An Ideal Husband,”
-by “the author of Lady Windermere’s Fan.”
Everybody knows that the author in question is a
calamitous person named Oscar Wilde. The
brain responsible for “ A_n Ideal Husband ” is
shockingly diseased; the hand which penned the
manuscript is reported to be picking oakum.
Therefore, Oscar Wilde’s, play was placed before
the public as a convicted felon, so to speak. They
saw it under the disadvantages of gaol-clothes and
absurdly abbreviated hair, they scanned its fea-
tures in eager search for signs of turpitude, and
yet felt hound to confess that this was one of the
most pleasing plays'they have gazed upon.
In Sydney, where “ An Ideal Husband ” appeared
behind the spikes at the end of the season,
The Bulletin was struck by the prisoner’s
healthy aspect. The sentiment of “Lady Win-
dermere’s Fan” seemed to pride itself on being
contemptible, hut “An Ideal Husband ” bids for
respect.as well as cynical admiration. The slender
plot is very moral. A husband, who has been
guilty of only one financial sin against his high
principles, is made to suffer much at the hands of
a wicked adventuress and an abnormally good
wife. The wife learns to temper her rigid virtue
with a little ordinary feminine forgiveness* and
the friend of the family is a well-meaning indi-
vidual, given to talking sense when he isn’t
spouting sham paradoxes. Also, the father of
this friend reprimands him for his reckless habit
of spouting as aforesaid, and the wicked adven-
turess, who is the most inveterately “smart”
talker of them all, and who even thinks epigrams
aloud when she is left by herself in a room, gets
clean knocked out in the third act. The fourth
act is devoted to high principle, cheerful love-
making, willing self-sacrifices, connubial devotion,
and all that is most desirable in this world. Oscar
Wilde got this clever work from the sound side of
his intellect, whereas “ Lady Windermere’s Fan ”
was written, by the debased oakum-picker. The
two plays ’'should not be linked together on the
bill. Better to ascribe “ An Ideal Husband ” to
O. Wilde, deceased.
# • •
The cast of characters is the same as in
Sydney. Miss Olliffe’s picturesque adventuress
introduces the new actress to a Melbourne
audience, and the audience considers her a fine,
imposing, sweet-voiced artist, with a charming
little foot and ample ability to play her part.
Miss Faber, as the wife, is another special success,
whilst Messrs. Titheradge, Ward, Boucicault, and
Miss Noble are less special, but none the less
valuable in their places. “ An Ideal Husband ”
deserves a great success.

The Opera House variety show flows on,
but the rival co. at the Bijou will shift down into
the Oxford Theatre before the week is out. R.
S. Smythe has secured a brief lease of the Bijou,
and on Monday next he intends to produce
Frederick Yilliers, regardless of expense. Villiers
is advertised to come “ fresh from the seat of
war,” wherefore it is reported in Melbourne
that a gory conflict has been raging in Sydney.
The war-artist is expected to display several stir-
ring pictures of Parkes attacking the Government
on the rear flank of its policy.

Clifford whose last lecture on sing-
ing drew an admiring crowd, starts a series of
concerts at the Town Hall qn Saturday. Concerts
have dropped out of favor of late, nevertheless Mr.
Hall 6 is likely to make a success with his particu-
lar “ vocal and instrumental recital.” His pupil,
Miss Marguerite Ribhentrop, will be a chief attrac-
tion, and the first Australian appearance of this
tail young soprano is looked forward to with con-
siderable awe.

At Melb. Royal the two superior villain 8
are working out their respective destructions to
flourishing business, and the noble Baker is still
chipping in a casual reference to The Union Jack
just for the sake of appearances. Otherwise this
popular melodrama would have no visible claim
to its title. Its purpose as a military and naval
spectacle is not to draw attention to Hing-
land’s glory, but to expose the awful
character of a captain and an army con-
tractor. It even suggests that the British
bayonets would double up if suddenly brought
into contact with foreign stummicks. “ The
Fatal Card” succeeds “The Union Jack’’ on
Saturday. Bland Holt is making so much money
that lie can afford to withdraw a lucrative specula-
tion for fun, or perhaps his season is limited to a
certain number of weeks, and he has sworn to pro-
duce as many novelties as possible within the time.
Anyhow, “ The Fatal Card” will he played on
Saturday.

The death of a young wife is, by time-
honored custom, treated as a cause for unwhole-
some lamentation in newspaper obituary and
funeral notices. If the deceased lady was an act-
ress, the wail of the flabby-minded journalist be-
comes positively offensive. It is then a rouged,
powdered, spangled, lime-lit wail, the cry of an
amateur mummer in a burst of artificial distress—
an insult to common sense. Melbourne Argus
sobbed theatrically over the burial of Mrs. Tapley.
“ They lowered the little coffin down into the
earth, and a glorious sunset spread its rosy hues
over |he faces of all as the last words were said.
Then' the curtain of the night fell slowly, and the
little actress went home to rest.” “The extreme
youth of the dead actress, the pathetic circum-
stances of her death, and the presence of her
bereaved husband, who had doffed the mot-
ley in Sydney on Friday last only to put on
the garb of mourning here on Monday, lent an
infinite pathos to the last scene.” Maudlin drivel
and stagey cant. There is no exceptional pathos
in an actor’s bereavement. Everybody wears
motley in his daily business. And what of this
precious paragraph : “It was just in front of the
Princess’s Theatre that a pathetic little incident
occurred. As the carriage containing the wreaths
passed along a large white lily became detached
from one of the tributes and fell in the dust. In
a second a young girl with tearful eyes stepped
out from the crowd, rescued the flower from
under the feet of the horses, and pressed it closely
to her bosom.” Ugh !
At Poverty Point .
Among the tributes to Vi Varley’* dramatic charm
was that given by Sarah Bernhardt the night she was
sitting in a box at Melb. Princess when the “Old Guard "
was being played. When Violet Varley sang the song
with the Hoih>-1& chorus the whole theatre rose and
joined in, and Bernhardfsnatched the flowers from the
bosom of her dress, kissed them, and threw them straight
at little Varley—“ La petite Varley.”
Vi. Varley was a native of Talbot (Vie.), and the youngest
of two families. It is said that the distant cause of fier
death was over-exertion in “The Mountebanks” some
months back in Sydney.
The beauteous Florence Lloyd was thrown ofl her horse
in Adelaide. At first it was thought one of her lovely
limbs was broken, but a doctor—lucky wretch ! —examined
it, and said no pretty bones were injured. Adelaide cor-
poration lias been asked to rail off the spot where Flor-
ence fell, so that dudes may visit it regularly. Five
thousand applications have been received for the honor
of shooting the sacrilegious horse.
The only unkind thing written about the Blind Students
Concert Co., which come from Melb. and is travelling to
raise funds for the chart table institution in which the stu-
dents were trained, appeared in Sydney D.T.! “The visiting
performers have proved themselvesjess capable and in-
ferior in training to the pupils of our noble local institu-
tion hear to the University ; which pupils are far younger
in years and about whom no pretentious claims are
foisted upon the public.” Now, who teaches the pupils of
“ our noble local institution ? ” And who wrote the D.T.
notice ?
News comes from Paris that the pretty Melb. Israelite,
Miss Lalla Miranda, has made such headway that she will
appear as prima-dotma in “Lakme,” at the Opera
Comique, in October next.
The energetic Miss Juliet Flegeltnub, of Ballarat, who
lately appeared as Josephine, in “Pinafore,” at a Melb.
charity performance, has accepted a probationary engage-
ment'With Williamson and Musgrove. Yet another Vic-
torian Jewess!
Two of Vi. Varley’s most successful songs—“ When a
merry maiden marries, sorrow goes and pleasure tarries.
Every sound is now a song, all is right and nothing
wrong.” And another (from “ Dorothy ”)— *•The time
has come when I must yield the liberty I love so well ”
ending with the hag’s chorus, “ Aye, aye, aye, poor little
dear, wait till she comes to the end of the year.”
Prophetic?
Wallace Brownlow engages with W. and M. for another
12 months in Australia, and probably goes on for a few
months over the 12. Brownlow, by the way, has no
ambition to die in stage harness. He has set his mind on
ending his days as an English merchant.
The most gruesome send-off on record is Sydney Tele-
graph's farewell to the departing Nellie Stewart:—
“ There is an allegorical fitness in the selection of ‘ La
Cigale ’ as the opera in which Miss Stewart makes her last
Australian appearance—for some time, at least. Miss
Stewart emulates the grasshopper heroine of the drama-
tised fable. She is at the head of her profession here,
receives homage at every public appearance, and divides
honors with no one. Yet she cannot be content, but
must go abroad in search of new laurels and the gratifica-
tion of foreign applause. If she succeeds, very well.
If not? Then she will return, grasshopper-like,
after many years, old and pass6e even Miss
Stewart can’t go on looking girlish and pretty for
ever—to find the ants in occupation of her comfortable
home. New schools of players and play-goers will know
not Miss Nellie Stewart except ns an liis'oricat remnant.
and at her complimentary benefit (‘positively h»r last
appearance on I lie stage ') a callous general ion will shrug
its shoulders when the quavering voices of oldest inhabit-
ants tell what a charming actress she used to be. Or she
will return when the next century is no baby, and learn
the hard lesson that a tinny voice and an ugly shape can-
not be atoned for by a record of old-world success."
Miss Devlin (daughter of handsome “Dolly " of that
ilki is frequently heard singing in private now in London
(writes Tun Bulletins correspondent). She has a re-
m-irkahly nice soprano, admirably trained by Marches!,
who seems to be the teacher most approved by Aus-
tralians.
Ethel Haydon holds her own in London pretty' well
(writes The Bulletin’s correspondent). She is nice and
pleasant on the stage, but her voice is too small. She
will never he a great burlesque actress, whatever she may
do in light comic opera.
Annie Taylor, The Bulletin regrets to hear, has been
reduced by sickness to a ghost of her old self.
Williamson and Mnsgrove made a pretty considerable
profit on the expensive “Gaiety" season, in Melbourne,
although “A Gaiety Girl,” which was the Co.’s trump-
card, didn’t take a trick.
Journalist: “Familiar mistakes recur in our profession,
as, for instance, an agreement by the Melb. papers to
keep out MBs Varley’s death, on Monday, so as not
to shock her husband. The news reached him in a
more aggravated way, through condolatory telegrams."
Miss Varley’s death makes one think of two other
pathetic theatrical deaths of Melb. actresses scythed ofl
in their flower—Ellen Mortyn and Mdlle. St. Denis.
Hattie Sbepparde (wife of tenor Hallam) was another,
and she died under circumstances not unlike those in the
case of Vi Varley.
A man is never a prophet in his own country', but a
woman sometimes is. For instance, the three highest
prices realised at theauclion in Melbourne of dolls dressed
by actresses were for Nellie Stewart’s, which averaged £5
each. Grace Palotta’s doll was next at £4.
An “iron-jawed woman” died suddenly' at Sydney the
other day of heart-disease. A lesson to weight-lifters.
There are vacant dates available for Sydney Theatre
Royal, as will be seen from an advt.
The most lively, and not least popular, of the Gaiety
ladies has four children.
“ Decimal ” Moore is not bad. But what about “ Infini-
decimal ’’ Moore?
Grace Palotta is the most fetching of the Gaiety girls.
This is certain, because pious Adelaide confirms experi-
enced Melb. “ Maud Hobson is a beauty, but her legs
are faulty, whereas the Palotta hasperfect limbs, a pretty
face, and such eyes ! ”
Bland Holt’s dramatic gold-mine, “The Span of Life,”
has reached London Princess’s. An unusual instance of
a play being a proved success in every part of the globe
before London sees it.
Nellie Stewart is having the way prepared forher second
London advent. Both the latest numbers of St. Paul’s
and the Album contained large pictures, and gushing
notices, of her sweet self.
The aim of the pretty and clever daughter of a well-
known impresario is to take to opera-bouffe and outshine
the prima donna on whom pa smiles. But pa forbids!
Poor little Vi. Varley was an unassuming, unpretentious,
girl off the stage. She used to go about with the im-
pression that she hadn’t a grain of ability, and it was,,
only the constant pressure of relatives and admirers.,
which kept her up to sticking-point. After continuous-,
playing with the Comic Opera Co. for eight years, she .
quarrelled with “the Firm” some months ago, and,
severed her connection finally with that organisation. A a
good many efforts have been made since to get her to ,
appear again, but her dispute with W. and M. marked a ,
resolve to quit the Australian stage until she had con-
quered London. Her mind w’as full of the. plans for a ,
course of study under Randegger, and she was bent on ,
making a big effort to outshine a certain other Australian ,
star who somehow didn’t manage to scintillate over-
brilliantly in the London firmament.
The highest rate now paid to full dramatic co.’s (to
play and find plays like the “ Shaughraun,” &c., actors .
and everything included) by hall-proprietors, in Mel- ,
bourne, for one night’s show, finds a Jimiteat £5. Andi
then the capitalist considers the price extortionate.
The Melb. lady who tames lions for fun, and who, until';
lately, had several pet snakes, admits to a Herald scribe
that she is mortally afraid of rats. If Tu* Bulletin were ■
that lady’s husband it would keep a few tame rats.
A lot of people who gaze into the kinetoscope and see a>
cock-fight reproduced by photography regard Edison's-*
miracle as a paltry illusion compared with theHauntedl
Swing. A new scientific revelation doesn’t impress themi
half as much as a mechanical trick. The explanation,
lies in the fact that the swing makes them qualmish:.
The seat of man’s imagination is his stummiok.
Miss Florrie Simonsen, daughter of Mrs. Fannie Simon-
sen, purposes deserting the Melb. concert platform. She
is going to be married to a Mr. Turrell, a London com-
mercial man.
Historical literature via the Gaiety Co.: “Of course
she’s French, but lots of good families are French.
William the Conqueror was a Frenchman.” “True.
Why, she might even be descended from Joan of Arc."
“ Well, hardly 1 ” Nobody saw it.
It is now a clearly provable fact that there
were no less than 15 Freetraders in N.S.W.
Assembly who promised old-man Parkes their
support to his want-of-confidence motion, but sold
him.
The fashionable criminal charge of the
present season in N.S. Wales is that form of
assault upon a female which involves the services
of the sheriff’s deputy’s final deputy. In the
majority of instances, the prosecutrixes have repen-
ted of their first assertions and admitted the verity
of certain impeachments, or the accusations have
been plainly disproved. But as so many false
starts have been publicly made, it would seem as
though Cornstalkian maledom is at present largely
under the influence of blackinaildom.
Richard Chaffey Baker, M.A., now Presi-
dent of S. A. Legislative Council, is the strongest
Conservative in local politics. He it was whom
Premier Kingston was so anxious to slay in a duel
three years ago. Although still comparatively
young, it is more than a quarter of a century
since Mr. Baker was first sent to the Assembly for
Barossa, and his term of continuous service in the
Council has been longer than that of any of his
present colleagues. For an aggregate space of 784
days he has held office in various Ministries, and ,
it is now 18 months since he attained to the Presi-
dent’s chair in the House, which for half-a-dozen
years previously had been practically under his ;
thumb. He was beginning to think that Queen ,
Victoria had forgotten him, and if he had been,
passed over again on the ’present occasion he
might have drifted into deep and desperate dis-,
loyalty. Though they speak when they meet,
officially, there is still a great gulf between King-
ston and Baker, and last year the former was very
markedly left out from the list of invitations fcV»
the President’s dinner.

A Gentleman welldtnown in London financial
circles, returning to England shortly, is prepared
to undertake the flotation of a high-class MINING
PROPERTY.
Address— _
“ Mines,” Bulletin Office.
The Wild-Cat Column .
The Bulletin has long maintained that all
Australian borrowings should be done locally, and that
the local market would supply money as cheaply as it
could be obtained in London. The result of the South
Australian loan, floated last week, proves this contention
to be correct. Compared with the results of three other
loans recently issued in London, matters stand somewhat
as follows :-—M loriland, which has floated no loans for a
good many years and has now the best credit of all the
provinces,'got its money in London at £3 6s. 6d. per cent,
interest. Westralia raised its money in the same city at
i'3 Bs. per cent., and the Queensland loan costs about
£3 11s. per cent. This is calculated on the amount
received, after deducting accrued interest and probable
expenses. The S. A. loan was floated in Adelaide
at £3 10s., more than twice the amount required
being offered at very short notice. The loan was
issued at a fixed price ; under the tender system it
would probably have realised more and thus re-
duced the interest. Moreove*, Adelaide is not a
financial centre like Melbourne and Sydney, in either
of which cities the operation would probably have
been conducted still more successfully. Yet, after allow-
ing for the saving in expenses, the S.A. Government has
do'ne decidedly better in Adelaide than the Queenslanders
did in London, and has done very nearly as well as
Maoriland and Westralia. And, in any case, it is far
cheaper in the end to pay £3 10s. per cent, interest to
oneself than £3 6s. 6d. per cent, to anybody else. That
is just where the difference between local and foreign
borrowing oomes in.
* * • •
The Colonial Bank of Australasia meets its
creditors on the 17th with a proposal to reduce interest
on deposits to 24 per cent, for five years, and thereafter
to pay current rates, whatever these may be. One-fifth
of the 5, 6 and 7-year deposits are to be paid on maturity
and the other four fifths extended for five years. The 10-
year deposits are to be extended for three years. The
one excellent feature about the Colonial management was
that it never took British deposits. Its creditors being
almost all in Victoria, it will probably get its arrangement
through, while the City of Melb., which started much
earlier, is still struggling to explain things to indignant
Scotch creditors who have a vague idea that their money
has been stolen by aboriginals. The Colonial, it is also
understood, intends writing off a good deal of its capital
as lost when a new Act is passed making such a proceed-
ing possible. * » *
The leading bank-managers of Australia have
held a conference and drafted the outline of anew bank-
ing bill, which the various Parliaments are to be invited
to accept. It provides for a stringent definition of what
constitutes a bank, for certain modifications in the quar-
terly returns, for putting the note issue on anew basis,
and for a more definite form of audit. The scheme is
not yet made public, but it is safe to assume that it deals
with all these matters from a banker’s standpoint much
more than from the standpoint of the public. Meanwhile,
the present N.S.W. Bank Notes Act is near its expira-
tion ; that comprehensive Banking Act which was
promised is still missing ; and Premier Reid’s State Bank
proposals are very remote and intangible. Under these
circumstances, and until the State Bank oomes along,
some legislation is evidently needed to fill the gap. One
effective way to with the note difficulty would be to
provide that any existing bank may issue notes to any
xtent, on the one condition that it deposits with
the Treasury, Government stock to the full amount of
its issue, said stock to be held as security for the notes
and used to redeem them in case of default. On
the deposit being made the Treasury would issue
a licence to print and circulate nobs to a
certain definite amount. The issue being thus
practically guaranteed by the State the present regu-
lation, by which paper-money is redeemable in gold
at the bank’s head office only, would injure nobody.
Most banks would probably deposit a much larger amount
of stock than was required to cover their ordinary issue,
and with this security on hand the Government could
tide over any sudden crisis by declaring the notes so
covered to be.legal tender for any period that might be
necessary. * * »
The National Bank of Tasmania reports a neb
profit of £5590 for the half-year, and reduces its div. to
5 per cent. This absorbs £3BOI, and after paying £2OO
income-tax there is £1589 to cany forward. The National
of Tas. was founded in ’BS out of the ruins of the Bank of
Tasmania. It has a capital of £152,040, and it used to
have a humble reserve of £37,500, but this has lately
been reduced to £22,500. It doesn’t seem to have pro-
vided to any great extent for the evil day which cnmes
on every hank sooner or later, for between May and Nov.,
’94, it appears to have paid away in diva, all its profits
save £33, and this amount isn’t calculated to materially
strenglhen even a very small bank.

Seventeen years ago Christchurch (M.L.) Drain-
r Board reported joyfully that it had borrowed in
London £200,000 at 6 per cent, fixed fqy 50 years, so that
the loan can’t be repaid or the interest reduced -until
1928. Thai was in boom-time. Now the decrease in pro-
perty values has made the 6 per cent, an awful and in-
tolerable burden, and, judging from present appearances,
Christchurch may, in a few years, go broke after the
fast don of Oamaru and New Plymouth. In addition to
£500,000 advanced by the State, Maoriland local bodies,
of one kind and another, have borrowed locally £1,100,000,
and in London over £5,000,000. Of this amount nearly
one-half is at rates varying from 6to 9 per cent!_ The
British Shylock has been worse than the local one in his
dealings, more than half his money being lent at six and
s ven per cent. Under these circumstances, the going
broke of various Maoriland local bodies can be viewed
with complacency. The probable end of the business will
he that Govt, will offer the various creditors 3 or 3* per
cent, with a State guarantee, and put a strict limit to
future borrowing, or, better still, shut down on all bor-
r wing except from the Treasury ; and put in some kind
of a receiver to collect the interest and sinking-fund till
the liability is cleared of. This process would save the
country fully £120,000 per annurn-avery large amount
for so small a community,

Newcastle coal is sold in Sydney at 18s. per ton.
In Melbourne, de-pite 500 miles extra carriage, it is now
sold at from 13s. to 15s. 6d. This reduction fro™ the
old 255. rate was evidently made to cut out the local
collieries, which sell at from 12s. 6d. to 16s. But the
Turner Govt, holds that, if the local coal co. s were burst
up, the imuorting ring would promptly U P ™
price to the old monopoly figure, so it wisely continues to
patronise the local producer. Cheapness can often he

The Australian-butter market, writes The Bul-

demoralised owing to a very large lot h iving been thrown
on (he market-at low prices by a bank which had ad-
vanced upon it. Some was sold down to 265. per owt.
This should prove a lesson to shippers, for far more is
being sent over just now than the market can comfort-
ably absorb. The brokers and dealers are in despair, and
are wondering where the thing is going to end. Why does
not somebody try to discover some other means of pre-
serving butter than Uy freezing, for this process most
Undoubtedly bas a deleterious effect upon the butter,

The North Sydney Investment and Tramway
Co.—now burst—was formed to acquire 1000 acres of
land at North Shore. The co. bought the land for
£512,000. The man who sold it to the co. and thus left
that concern to hold the huge and dropsical infant, seems
to have paid £500,000 for it a few weeks earlier. The
man he goUit from had bought it a month previously for
£300,000 from one Billyard, and Billyard had acquired
it a few days earlier for £200,000. If the rise was in any
sense a natural one, then it was a most remarkable rise ;

The Kaffir boom has set everybody wild, and
the most ridiculous prices are being paid for shares,
writes Tub Bulletin's London ' correspondent. _ Take

believe, £2,750,000. The market is valuing it at nearly
£25 000,000, that is, £9 for the £1 share ! Other mines
are selling in proportion. Had the Londonderry not
knocked the bottom out of VVestrali.ans, some of the rub-
bish in that part of the world would also be at ridiculous
prices, hut, unfortunately for promoters who are loaded

Central (8.H.) directors agree to the postpone-
ment of the “confirmatory” meeting, and from present
appearances the sale to the "American” syndicate will
not he made. Had the directors resisted the postpone.-
ment proposal nasty things would have been said atymt
the non-reporting of the kaolin “ find ” at the first meet-
ing. This much may at least be said in their favor, that
their general manager, Randolph Adams, is not likely to
have given them any sensational report upon the striking
of the body, or for the first two or three days. He has
the reputation of persistently under-estimating—on the
whole, an excellent failing, but, as this case proves,
awkward at times.

At one time it was unsafe for reporter or visitor

There was no such word in Mr. Howell s vocabulary ;

loudest about creeps. Worst of all, this practice, an
obviously mean one, isn’t repressed. The same thing

these movements were pooh-poohed ; now they are sub-

which, like those of the adjacent Junction, are generally

The evolution of the Cobar copper-mine is an
object-lesson in N.S.W. mining. For years it was worked
profitably for copper alone, no allowance being made for
its gnld-eontenis, in fact, it is hut a few years since the
co. was made aware of the gold —by Fattier Curran, it is
said. About 18 months ago it was taken on tribute, by
men who had no previous experience in copper-smeinng
beyond that got by reading Dr. Peters’ work. Per aid of
the gold they make a fair profit, and, with a low copper-
market, the co. have paid a,div. out of the" royally. It
would he interesting to estimate the gold lost by the co.,
and made by copper-buyers in England, when the mines
rich oxidised ores were being treated years ago. -

Grenfell, N.S.W., says a Bur.hF.TrN correspon-
dent, has not been so Ivus.v as now during the last twenty
years. Some of the claims are on new finds; others are
working old finds re-opened. The Young O’Brien has 800
tons waiting at the battery ; last parcel (500 tons) averaged
over an oz. Some excitement has been caused by the
finding of a3oz. nugget in the wash from Dane and John-
son’s alluvial claim, S:rr Gull}'. Alluvial work is on the
inerease ; many parties are making wages from the old
ground. Altogether there must he fully 100 men now
constantly working on the field. Amongst the other
claims being operated are the Enterprise (at 240tt.) which
has 90 tons of 15dwt. Slone ready for crushing; reef 24
inches. Stone from this mine has gone 2oz. Homeward
Bound (local syndicate) has a loz. reef at 431 ft. ; about 50
tonsat grass. It was a well-known div.-paying mine in
the seventies. Grenfell, which was wonderfully rich
many years ago, would probably repay a visit by any
experienced party with small capital.

Two scraps of conversation indicate how matters
stand at v\ hile Cliffs. Mine-owner (a big “ employer ”of

Dear Bulletin, —You don’t altogether do
justice to Rev. Stone-Wigg, who is more than
fairly liberal for a parson. The Canon’s shot was
something to this effect : That the actual number
of coins in the collections was incompatible with
the size of the congregations. But he also said
that, while the poorer people gave generously, as
a rule—sometimes more, perhaps, than they cen-
veniently could, it was those bedecked in finery
who gave least.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback- the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation, in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

Mr. James Robertson, miner, West Wallsend,
N.S.W., who writes on February 17th, 1893;—
For a number of-years I have suffered from
chronic dyspepsia. I have been under a number
of doctors, and what relief I derived was only-
temporary. Finding I gained no permanent
relief I gave Clements Tonic a trial, and tin-
benefit I derived simply surprised myself—after
so many other remedies failing—it removed pains
from which I had been suffering for years. My
appetite increased daily, and also my strength. I
am only too happy to give my testimony, as a
plain working miner, as to the benefit 1
derived from your valuable Clements ffonic. All
my fellow workmen have known me for years, and

Dean Boyle, in his recently-published

that “if a sermon had been wanted in Attic
Greek, Badham would have been equal to the
occasion. I have had long letters from him in his
exile, full of emendations on Plato and Thucy-
dides, and when he met men like Conington at my
house he would pour forth his ideas upon Greek
texts and Shakespeare readings with astonishing
profusion. ”
The gilded Vic. M.L.C., Osmond, 30 years
ago was a furnace-worker at Newington crushing
battery, Stawell, when he bore the nickname of
“ Bill the Smelter.” His “rise” came with the
striking of a rich reef in the North Cross claim, in
which he held 2211 shares, on each of which he
for some time drew a fortnightly div. of £l. This
mine paid enormously for over seven years. Even
when wealthy, Osmond was a familiar figure in
Stawell on his black mare—making tracks from
the butcher’s with meat bought for himself.

The N.S.W. Chief Justice said, the other
day, that there ought always to be police about
the court, “because we never know what might
happen,” There are other Judges who also appa-
rently think that things might happen. For
instance, some time ago a man was being tried cm
a capital charge, and a few minutes before the
lunch-adjournment his lawyer tendered him as a
witness on his own behalf, saying: “ I presume,
your Honor, that the accused will now enter the
witness-box.” “ No,” replied his Honor promptly,
“ let him stay where he is and be sworn.” After
lunch the Judge, evidently seeing that to keep the
witness-prisoner in the dock while giving evidence
would be to leave a big opening for defending
counsel in addressing the jury, told accused that
“ perhaps he had better go into the box.” And
then people noticed that the water and ink-bottles
had been meanwhile cleared off the table, and a
fat detective stationed between his Honor and the
prisoner.

bably that of one of
the College domestics,
who stated in a shrill
soprano that the edi-
tor was “engaged in

that the rumor would prove false. Oscar’s alleged
lunacy turned out to be nothing more serious than
the sickness which every intelligent prisoner feels
when subjected to treadmill exercise—the eternal
purposeless “walking up stairs.” When his poor
fat legs showed signs of lameness and his bruised
spirit cried out against the absurdity of his
liver-shaking task, Oscar was put to oakum-
picking for the benefit of his health. At the
present moment, as likely as not, the miserable
aesthete sits in a dungeon cell pulling asunder,
with his white, tapering fingers and broken filbert
nails, the strands of a tarred rope. If he warms
the oakum over his little jet of gas, thereby melt-
ing the tar and taking half the punishment out of
the monotonous job, the warder spots Oscar’s
delinquency and reports him to the prison gover-
nor, who reduces Number So-and-So s allowance
of bread and water for the next fortnight. The
litterateur’s very identity is merged in an arith-
metical designation nowaday.; I'he name that
Oscar Wilde made for himsel. .■ lesn’t officially

H. : “ Probably in The Bulletin’s teeth,
I will hint that an idea in one of the Melb. daily
papers for an Australian penal station on one of
the outlying islands is worth noting.”
The land-tax resolutions division in N.S. W.
Assembly was encouragingly large numerically,
and totted up to (with pairs)—62 against 37; or
99 members out of a possible 122.
According to the Register, S.A. Opposi-
tion party consists of four, viz., Downer (leader),
Howe, Solomon and Castine, As the Register
is the Opposition organ, this is authentic.
St. James’s Gazette (London) thinks “it

former Premiers of N.S.W. to accept the post of
Governor at .£5OOO per annum.” It would 111
Varney Parkes, M.P., has resigned his
seat in N.S.W. Assembly through financial
trouble. The Bulletin hopes that Varney’s
chest-complaint is merely casual and not here-
ditary.
Good-bye to the idea of an Australian
Federal Supreme Court if vested rights are
acquired by our Judges to the succession to a seat
on the Judicial Committee of the British Privy
Council.
N.S.W. votes of censure are much tamer
proceedings just now than they were at the begin-
ning of ’93, when every week brought forth its
political crisis, and cordons of police and military
had to protect Legislature and legislators.
Men are employed in coal-lifting contracts
about the railways in Melbourne at Is. 4d. a day,
and “doss ” under the sheds and platforms. Yet
a local parson lifts up his voice and declares that
the great want of the country is “thews and
sinews.”
The N.S.W. Lands Acts should be consoli-
dated, and the cardinal points prominently dis-
played at every Lands Office in the province, along
with proper maps and full descriptions of available
land. And this applies to other provinces than
N.S.W.
Vic. Govt, retrenched its coal-bill this
year by refusing to allow fires in public offices
until June 1, even the Premier himself shivering
in the wintry atmosphere like a martyr. But
towards the end of May a cold blast came down
on Melbourne, and froze the civil-service to such
an extent that it couldn’t work, and on May 27 its
nose became so blue and its teeth chattered so
horribly that the rule had to be relaxed.
Reid has an-
other snahe which
he calls “ Mr.
Wise.”
The possibili-
ties of retrench-
ment appear to be
endless. Victoria
has reduced its
annual expendi-
ture from 10 to 6|
millions, and has
overhauled the
public depart-
ments again and
again, scores of
useless officials
being weeded out
each time. Now
Turner’s Public
Service Commis-
sion has gone over
the old ground
once more, and in
one office it found
13 highly - paid
clerks whose
duties had been
transferred to an-
other department
12 years ago, and
who had ever since
then been forgot-
ten, or overlooked,
or dropped out of
sight somehow,
though their sal-
aries were still
paid regularly.
And the Public
Service Board,
which was created
for the express
purpose of super-
vising the service,
really can’t re-
member anything
about the matter.
N S.W. Minister for Justice Gould con-
fessed to the Legislative Assembly last week that
the Attorneys-General have been inthe h JJ 0
taking public moneys to pay the oab-farea i ofbar
listers-all and sundry- who p might choose to
attend a vice-regal levee. The Bulle
abundantly disclosed in the past magnificent
robberies-by twenties, by fifties, by hun
permitted by law to these princes among licensed
bandits ; but, oh ! what a fall is here >! It is as f
the colossal forger, Miranda, descended to sno
dropping or as if the stioker-np of a gold-escort
prigged a carrot out of a Chinaman’s shoulder-
basket. Yah ! Robbers of gold-vaults and
bummers for a sneaked hash-house feed ! At one
and the same time the gods of plunder and the
gutter-rakers of larceny.
Significant that the Queensland railway
rates should be lowered just on the eve of a general
election when the votes of the Downs farmers will
be very much in requisition. .£50,000 per annum
is the estimated loss to the Treasury by this
manoeuvre.
Among the 54 N.S. W. members who voted
for the Reid income-tax of last week were six
Ministers—Brunker, Carruthers, Garrard, Gould,
S. Smith and Young—who, when private members
in ’93, voted against the then proposed Gibbs’
Income-tax Bill.
During three years of Chairman Smith’s
term, the S.A. railways (mainly owing to the
prosperity of Broken Hill) returned a handsome
profit after paying interest. No other Aus-
tralian system even pays interest. Smith’s pheno-
menal luck gave out in ’93.
Cambyses flayed an unjust Judge, tanned
the skin and nailed it on the judgment-seat,
each new occupant being sternly told to remember
what he was sitting on. The Frenchmen of the
Revolution tanned the skins of aristocrats and
made leather breeches. Australian wattle-bark
may be required some day for other skins than
cow-hides.
The social and political conditions from
which Chief Justice Darley can extract salaries at
the rate of £ll,OOO (£3500 plus £7500) and Chief
Justice Madden £9OOO (£3500 plus £5500), or
both together £20,000 from a combined popula-
tion of 2| millions, have produced, and must con-
tinue to produce, a badly-employed and badly-
paid “ working ” class.
Cablegram : “ Sir T. Fowell Buxton said
he hoped to foster increased feelings of loyalty in
South Australia. He congratulated Lord Rose-
bery on his success in the Derby on behalf of the
colonists who were fond of racing.” A brighter
remark than the above could be found any day in
the copy-book of a 7-year old school-girl. Why
should we have to suffer such things at breakfast?
They are a slow-going race in Westralia.
For instance, the Ooolgardie telegraph is a single
wire, and to prevent it being blocked by pressure
of traffic, no Westralian newspaper is allowed to
receive more than 500 words a day from the field.
The wire works by day only, hence the pressure ;
the idea of employing a night operator and keep-
ing things going all the 24 hours hasn’t yet
occurred to anybody.
Another leprous Kanaka has just been
discovered on a sugar-plantation at Mackay (Q.)
where the best sugar comes from. N.S. Wales
imports 33,000 tons of sugar from Queensland,
and a large quantity from Hongkong, Fiji and
Java, every grain of which means possible
leprosy. Cane-sugar, in almost every country
on earth save N.S. Wales, is a purely nigger or
Chinese product with possible leprosy in it.
S.A. National Ass. crowd last week ban-
queted Messrs. Smith, Hill and Neill, the retiring
Railway Commissioners. Symon, Q.C., Kingston’s
implacable enemy, was chief speaker, and the
result was a violent personal attack on the

.anxious to get into Parliament for years, but with
no success, and the Ass party consequently allows

N.S.W. Premier Reid cuts a poor figure
in connection with the Eddy episode. Ready to
promise Eddy anything, he is now ready to drop
him, and glibly ready to make quasi-excuse for
doing so. Dibbs : “ You are not keeping your
promise to Mr. E ldy. ” Reid : “ Well, since Mr.
Eddy is being paid £3OOO a year for leave of
absence, I do not think he has much to complain
about.” And this from a Prime Minister !
Litligow (N.S.W.), which is represented
by P.M.G. Cook, petitions strongly against Free-
trade. Lithgow lives mostly by industries which
are dependent on Protection, but it voted Free-
trade under the impression-that its own particular
industries were safe from interference, and that
other people’s industries didn t matt l r. N< W, io
its surprise, it finds itself in danger of getting the
thing it voted for, whereas it only intended that
other people should get it.
A feeling of pained surprise is expressed
in Sydney and Melbourne because South Aus-
tralia refuses to join in subsidising the proposed
Pacific cable. South Australia built and main-
tained the trans-continental telegraph, and
thereby furnished the other provinces with means
of communication with Europe and the rest of the
outer world, and these other provinces now feel
hurt at the unpatriotic selfishness of S.A. in not
helping to support a rival line which will do much
to destroy her business. This high-toned senti-
ment from Victoria an 1 N.9sW., which are even

now tearing each other’s hair in the frantic effort
to secure the Riverina railway-traffic, is very
touching.
Who is responsible for the clap-trap in
acting-Gov. Madden’s speech at the opening of
Vic. Parliament? “It appears as if the people
of Victoria were destined at no distant date to
reap the reward of the courage and patience with
which they have borne adversity.’ Some time in
the future they will find themselves reaping the
reward of their submission to the official jobbery
and corruption that has enabled a good many
adversity-makers to escape punishment.
Queensland is endeavoring fco give the
agricultural and pastoral industry a lift by reduc-
ing rail - freights on agricultural produce by
from 20 to 25 per cent, and wool-freights
bv 9 per cent., and is also making reductions
on timber, flour and coal. The Q. railways,
as a whole, already work at a heavy Joss,
and this step is expected to increase that loss
materially. Therefore, the community is to be
taxed to help along certain industries-which is
simply another form of Protection. N.S.W. 1 ree-
traders who advocate reduced freights are re-
quested to consider this aspect of the question.
The N.S.W. Parliament, The Bulletin
says again, could not do without W. I. Crick.
That pugnacious, political gadfly—a man of pro-
nounced parts and pronounced weaknesses—is in
reality the only Court of Appeal apparent to the
public vision, and is the only real and perpetual
Minister for Justice in the province. It takes
such brutal, humanity-awakening, oratorical fero-
city as that shown by him last week on the prison-
gag system to wake up Parliament. If the Reid
Government abolishes the Gag, as implied by the
Premier in reply to the debate thus started, the
credit of the abolition will belong to the devil-saint
Crick, and to nobody else.
The sugar controversy still rages in the
Sydney dailies. One of the latest shriekists on
the subject is a certain “M. S. Hill,” who points
out that N.S. Wales, in ’94, imported 38,000 tons
of sugar, the duty on which, at £5 per ton, was
,£190,000; and grew 25,000 tons, the price of
which was raised <£s a ton by the existence of the
duty. These two amounts make ,£315,000, and
M.S. Hill asks, in a blast of fury : “ For whom
are the whole people taxed this £315,000? Ihc
farmers.” Most people would imagine, from Mr.
Hill’s own figures, that £190,000 of the amount
wasn’t for the farmers or anybody else, but went
to pay the expenses of the Govt., and to save an
equal amount of taxation in some other shape,
but apparently this isn’t so. Meanwhile, it
appears from the Estimates that the sugar-duty
for ’94 didn’t realise £190,000, but that sugar and
molasses together only returned £163,000, or
something has gone wrong with the figures, as
usual. It is difficult to understand how blankly
ignorant of figures is the average economist until
he begins to write to the papers.
Poor M’Ooll, Patterson’s futile and gassy
Minister for Water Supply, was put up to criticise
the programme of the Turner Govt. He was
armed with nearly of notes and waved his
arms indignantly for some time. But his charges
only amounted to a statement that the Ministry
had reduced the allowance for boarding out desti-
tute children from ss. to 4s. per week, that it
should have knocked off one of-the city postal
deliveries, and that it was “inhuman” to press
selectors for arrears of rent. Two poor widows,
he said, had been so badly scared by the demands
for payment that they had sold their cows to raise
' the money demanded by a bowelless Government.
Then the Lands Minister gently asked for the
names and addresses of these widows, so that their
cases might be inquired into and the two poor old
dames letdown as lightly as possible, but M'Goll
refused to supply them, and Best insinuated that
he couldn’t because there had never been any such
widows, and M'Coll sputtered feebly and tried to
use strong language, and then the attack fizzled
out. Altogether it was about the feeblest thing
of its kind upon record.
Premier Reid says that he hopes to build
railways faster than they were ever built before in
New South Wales. If a Betterment law is not
passed, in the first place, this will mean that he
will have to borrow money faster than it was ever
borrowed before to pay for the railways, and more
particularly for the land resumptions, the latter
being generally the biggest item in the bill. Not
one mile of new railway should be commenced
until an efficient Betterment Act is in force.
At the levee held by Vic. Act-
ing-Gov. Madden on Queen’s Birth-
day, France and Russia were repre-
sented by M. Desjardins, the French
Consul. The majesty of the nigger Re-
public of Liberia was on the same
occasion embodied in three consuls.
A conference of Vic. Protec-
tionists lately affirmed the principle
of inserting a minimum wage clause
in the Factories Act. The Bulle-
tin has from time to time referred to
the unspeakable methods of the im-
porter-turned-manufacturer, and has
urged the minimum wage in Protec-
ted Industries as the obvious remedy.
But, more than this, it is a direct
challenge to Freetraders to put Pro-
tection under test conditions, and
prove itself for what it is. No in-
dustry is welcome unless it can pro-
vide its workers with a certain stan-
dard of living, and if Freetraders
are in earnest in their protestations
they will help to legislate this burden
for Protection. If the industries be
extinguished by the enactment, the
Freetraders will have proved their
case —if the industries flourish under
the minimum wage, JJthe Freetraders
shall for ever hold their peace. Amen.
The Maoriland Government
has taken possession of the unfin-
ished Midland railway under the
provisions of the Railway Construc-
tion Act, and, consequently, the pro-
vince’s one lawful experiment in
private land-grant railway budding
should now be near an_ end. The
Midland co. agreed to build 285 miles
of railway, and in consideration of
owning it and taking the profits was
to receive one-half of its cost-price in
land value at 10s. per acre. The co.
built about 90 miles of line, took its
land-errant thereon, and sold it at
13s. 6d. per acre, and then went on
strike for further concessions. It has
been on strike ever since, and at last
the patience of R. Seddon has given
out. The Govt, now proposes to
pay for the four unfinished fragments
of line, and complete them itself,
and swear off land-grants and “ pri-
vate enterprise.”
g.A. Govt, has given notice of the ve-
gumption of 98 sq. miles of land held by Mr. J.
Bosworth, an ex-legislator. It is to be cut up
into farms in time for next seeding season
In a list of J.’sP. gazetted in Adelaide
May 30, were the names of E. Alcock, chief
executive officer of the Rechabites, and of G.
Flecker, a prominent hotel-keeper. All things
to all men.”
The Bulletin lately called on all Fat
Men, Freetraders, and Anti-Socialists to handicap
Protection by imposing on it the burden of the
minimum wage. The Argus responds thus
There is certainly one department in which insistence
upon a minimum wage is justified If in any, and this is in
the trades which are heavily subsidised by the State. As
the grant is made with the avowed intention of raising
wages here above the British level, why should it be
a ]j owed j n these trades to sink below even the docker s
]eve] of 6d . the hour ?
Protectionists will welcome this “handicap’ as a
W elcome way of dishing the protected Fat Man.
Those who object to pensioners mono-
polising other people’s means of living can point
to three instances at least m Victoria lately,

, The beauty competition in Melb.—prize,

Bulletin, as the “Grace Palottery.” It was the

than lur mere looks, won their hearts. The

do not judge purely by faces, but by manner,
temperament, and all sorts of other things, men-

Parson Jas. Clarke, C. of E. incumbent at
Kogarah (N.S.W.)—so tender in love and so
dauntless in war! —is now battling with his Bishop,
lest his preaching-license be taken from him.
Clarke, having been divorced (pending appeal)
from his wife, is episcopally deemed too human to
remain a parson ; but the Bishop has reserved
judgment, principally on the ground that, until
leave to appeal is refused, the divorce-case is still
sub-judice. Whatever the event, Clarke is a
likely man to fight the issue on the most Quixotic
chances. The Church Temporalities Act will be
tested, and the powers of ecclesiasticism in Aus-
tralian courts weighed to the last grain. Parson
Clarke was the only O. of E. clergyman who
visited in prison Tom Walker, when that agnostic
celebrity shot poor Parson Laseron. Clarke even
found bail for Walker. But “when I was un-
justly detained in a lunacy asylum,” says Clarke,
“no brother clergyman visited me to comfort or

parson.

An amusing scene is enacted at the N.S.W.
Treasury on the Ist of every month. A retired
school-teacher calls for his pension, but will not
give up the receipt for same till he has the cheque
in his hand ; “ because,” he piously observes, “it
will not be honest for me to give a receipt for
Bomething I have not yet received, and ” —more
practically—“ you could keep the receipt, and say
I had been paid.” A clerk, therefore, has to hold
the cheque, while the ex-school-teacher holds the
receipt, and when the latter says “ Now ! ” they
grab for each other’s documents.

Capfc. Close, the N.S.W. soldier who
came into prominence recently through having
loved not wisely but too well, wishes to issue a
writ claiming .£5OOO damages from Major-General
Hutton. And the Major-General wishes the
Crown Solicitor to accept service— i.e., lie wishes
the country to take, the responsibility of the mis-
takes if any, committed in his official capacity.
The issue seems plain enough. If Gen. Hutton
took the action complained of without authority
from his Ministerial head (as alleged), then the
Gen. must take the responsibility. If otherwise,
the responsibility rests with Govt.
About a year ago the now-released Sydney
boom-defaulters petitioned for the remission of
what then remained of their term of gaol. In the
petition, they, or their friends, were injudicious
snough to suggest that their conviction was due to
the prevailing panic ; and further, that their sen-
tences wore, for the same reason, more severe than
those usual insuchcases. This riled the Judge, who
had both approved of the verdict and awarded the
sentence, and he sent in a minute so crushing that
even the influence which Abigail could bring to
bear took nearly a year to overcome its effect.

Brother Windeyer’s phenomenal luck
threatens to turn. Several recent cases of his
seem to be going the wrong way. The Dean case,
in which he averred he was as certain of accused’s
guilt “ as if he had actually seen him administer
the poison,” is certainly looking rather upside-
down ; and in the Clarke divorce-case, the C. of
E. ecclesiastical court failed to find Parson Clarke
guilty of drunkenness—of which the Civil Court
was fully assured. In the Butler v. Butler suit,
wherein Windeyer J. committed Mrs. Butler’s
brother (subsequently convicted) for perjury, two
people have now been committed for conspiring to
make it appear that the witness had perjured
himself.

A recent case of arsenical-poisoning fol-
lowing the Dean inquiry recalls the d ith of

The murderer was never discovered.

The Bulletin’s own special clairvoyant
predicts that the report of the Dean Commission
will be to the effect that it has taken a large
amount of new evidence, and finds there is reason-
able doubt as to the guilt of Dean, whose release
it recommends. Nothing will be said about the
absolute wickedness of the methods adopted at
the trial, and no comment will be made on the
presiding Judge’s theory that there were only two
alternative theories possible—either (1) that Dean
Was the poisoner, or (2) that one of the women
concerned did the deed—the theory (to some
extent backed up by expert medical evidence)
that very likely the woman was never poisoned at
all, having thus been quite overlooked.
# # *
One thing, anyhow, is certain ; That the
public is emphatically and overwhelmingly of
opinion that it is for the Crown to prove Dean
guilty, and not for Dean to prove his innocence.
The more than reasonable doubt which existed as
to the man’s innocence when the Commission of
Enquiry was appointed has been enormously
increased by the revelations as to the low-down
associations of the women concerned—to say
nothing of the disclosures made concerning the
rioketiness of the medical evidence, as reported
at the trial.
* * *
The Crown must have been hard-up to
asperse alleged-poisoner Dean’s character when it
puts in an absolutely illegal conviction recorded
against him in his infantile days. When 13 years
old he “soldiered” a horse, and, in default of
paying the fine, served three months in gaol.
Poor little wretch ! The 13-year-old boy who
would not soldier a horse, if he had half a chance,
is no true-born Australian.

It is time for Govt, to V'
provide a new lending library
in Sydney. The present obso-
lete structure looks like Noah’s
Ark stranded in Macquarie-street.
Thousands of useful volumes
are housed inside; should
the place catch fire it ,
will burn like a kero- k
sene-bond. The read-
ing-room is positively
revolting dirty, dis-
ordered and verminous, „ , '
and does not accommodate
a third of the people who wish
to use it.
It is gradually dawning upon a few usually
well-informed Australian business men that
there’s a lot of method in what was described as
the madness of a oertiiu Northern “merchant”
when he fitted up a portion of his suite of offices
as a luxurious drawing-room in which they were
entertained with cigars and wine ad lib. As at
least one foreign merchants friends at home have
bitter reason to know, their host is purely and
simply the secret political agent of a foreign
power.

It is unfortunate that the defence was not
able to call the clairvoyante lady as a witness at
Dean’s trial ac Darlinghurst, as her evidence
would probably have had considerable weight
with the Judge. There would have then been a
conflict of clairvoyancy, for the Judge, as it were,
saw a fair man putting poison in his wife’s food,
and the other possessor of supernatural sight saw
a dark man as the cause of all the trouble. Bub
the amateur wizard would surely have given way
to the professional.

■ The story goes that Dr. Knaggs’ intended
anti-spiritualistic exposition at the N.S.W.
Women’s Loan Exhibition fell through, on the
ground that the proposed show was of a nature
calculated to offend the Cissy and Josephine
brigade. If The Bulletin mistakes not, Dr.
Knaggs is the medico who was, some_ years ago,
publicly challenged by a Sydney spiritist to give a
performance of the nature indicated. It is a pity
that his offer should have lapsed.

Pilcher, Q.C., complains, and with reason,
of the manner in which the N.S.W, Crown Law
office is conducting the Dean Enquiry. The
matter is being fought, on the part of the Crown,
with all the bitterness of a contested action, and
with all the desperation of a defence. The Crown
Law offices are determined to wipe away the
implied slur upon their administration, and the
police, knowing this, see promotion in the ruin of
Dean, and are tempted to act accordingly.
HIS LATEST PICTURE.
“The faculty” adores terrible names.
Through the Dean Poisoning Commission! the
public knows more about “peripheral neuritis”
than it knows about influenza ; and yet, a
month ago, not one reader in 10,000 had
ever heard of such an awful thing. Which
awful thing is merely a symptom of several
“complaints,” and every hardened old sot who
has “ suffered ” a prolonged “recovery” has pro-
bably had it a hundred times. “ Wot’s er matter,
ole f’ler?”< )“ Got the cramps in my toes, knees,
and hands.” “Cramps? By Jove! old man,
you’ve got peripheral neuritis!” Then the har-
dened old sot will try and recollect a prayer, and
give up his drunken-ghost.

“You see, I never receive gentlemen,”
was the remark of the female clairvoyant who
gave evidence before the Dean Commission last
week. Just so. It is the women who rush the

diviners and futurists, and not only the vulgar
and illiterate females, either. Lovely woman has
such a stock of superabundant curiosity that
things mundane, from A to Z, fail to satisfy her,
and peer she must into the supposed supernatural.
When palmistry fails, she goes for clairvoyancy ;
that worked out, to the common “cutting of the
cards ” —three rows of the “ mystic nine” and five
over for indices of prognostication—with the yarn
about the fair man and the dark worked out by
“rules of contrairies.” The cards being satisfied,
she will live to be further fooled by the mere dregs
of a brew of tea in a cup, just as ancient priestly
soothsayers used to build auguries from the entrails
of an ox. Bah! Humanity progressive? Not as
to superstition ;it merely changes its vogues. All
the same : Short advice to fortune-tellers —“Never
receive gentlemen.”
In one particular, the Dean-case fortune-teller
was strikingly schismatioal from the usual
“patter” of her craft. Ninety-nine clairvoyants
in a hundred, of the vulgar fortune-telling sort,
and even trance-lecturers and alleged medical
diagnosers, will tell you that they “ never remem-
ber what they saw or said in ‘ that state.’ ” Never-
theless, that is nob always true of the true
trance or catalepsy. No less authorities
than Peter, Paid and Patmoa John and all
the ancient seers and orthodox cranks prove that
much abundantly. And so it is alleged by the
more enlightened fin-de-siecle “ psychics ” who are
neither the “flesh” of spiritualists, nor the
“ fowl ” of the theosophists, but merely their own
doubtful sort of “red-herring.” An alcoholic
cateleptic always remembers his “visions,” but,
if he doesn’t make a note of them right on the
point of waking, five minutes will often bury
them in oblivion for ever.

The American “Transportation Commis-
sion ” has come to Australia. This is indeed a
most insulting circumstance.
The centre of Europe is the great
suicide land. There are very few suicides
among the mountains, bub in the low-
lands they are plentiful, principally along
the banks of large rivers. In swampy
regions their numbers diminish. _ More
suicides take place in June than in any
other month, and less in December. As
many suicides take place in the first 10
days of each month as in the last 20.
Men generally kill themselves on Mon-
days, Tuesdays, and Thursdays (Wednes-
day—always selected by the Jews for
weddings—for some reason or other, is
an off-day, and after Thursday man is
probably kept up by the knowledge that
he will get his wages on Saturday).
Women generally suicide on Sunday,
most likely through the misery of the old
man being at home that day.
Which reminds The Bulletin of some-
thing. Mr. and Mrs. Dean, of the
mysterious Sydney poisoning-case, must
have been together by far too much for
their mutual happiness—anyhow, Dean
must have been far too much in the way,
no matter how gotd and level-tempered
his wife may have been. He was in
command of the night_ ferry-boat, the
only means of communication between
North Shore, where their home was, and
Sydney, and so he had his wife, as it were,
almost under lock-and-key. And as he
was up all night he was at home all day.
They might ha\e been happy had they
lived in Sydney —without his mother-in-
law.
The latest, and least, of Melbourne’s
amateur vocalists to take a benefit for the purpose
of going ’Ome to study is Miss Gertrude Jerrard.
Her farewell concert at the Town Hall was well
attended, so Miss Jerrard will doubtless stare for
London forthwith, and place her organ under
Santley’s care. It is understood that Santley has
kindly undertaken to do his best for the young
lady. He was very friendly with her father in
days of yore, which seems to explain the baritone’s
otherwise unaccountable admiration for his old
friend’s daughter’s singing powers. To the
writer’s way of thinking, Miss Jerrard is very i n-
likely to “ knock ” Europe either with her t( p
notes or her comic opera abilities, and the writer
speaks as one who has suffered a rendering of
Serpolette (in “ Cloches de Corneville ”) at her
fair young hands. This, however, is no reason
why Miss J. shouldn’t go home to study. Unfor-
tunately, her triumphant departure is likely to
unsettle the minds of dozens of other young
amateurs having equal pretensions to notice.
Madame Belle Cole’s testimony to Miss Gertrude
Jerrard’s musical prospects was rather ambiguous,
“ Before many years I hope to hear that she has
secured some kind of position in the old world.”

Since the scandal about the mysterious
disappearance of the Yic. Parliamentary mace,
extraordinary precautions have been taken to
protect the present gilded wooden bauble. It is
“planted” every evening after the House uses,
in a part of the cellar of the building known only
to the officer who has 'special charge of it, and is
solemnly dragged forth again about a quarter of
an hour before the House sits. Not even Mr.
Speaker knows where it is kept. An indiscreet
reporter who jocularly asked a question about it
one day, was eyed with the gravest suspicion, and
has since been made to feel like a marked man.
The mace is still a painfully sore subject with the
Parliamentary officials.

Melbourne johnnies, having gained experi-
ence at last Actors’ Charity Carnival, this time
mostly took the precaution to provide themselves
with small change. One gilded youth took a
friend to a refreshment-bar, asked for two drinks,
and pub down a shilling. “What’s this for?”
said the Thespian behind the bar, looking scorn-
fully at the “ bob.” “ Two drinks,” said the cus-
tomer. The actor-man answered never a word,
but solemnly drew the cork from a bottle of
Pommery, and handed it over, remarking, “ ’Ere,
help yourselves. I couldn’t insult you with any-
thing else.”

Mrs. Dean, of Winton (M.L.), in whose
garden the remains of three deceased infants were
lately dug up, is described by her neighbors as the
good Samaritan of the district—a woman who
was always ready to assist everybody in distress
to the utmost of her ability. Also, she was a
good-looking woman of considerable refinement,
and had a poetic craze for flowers, her flower-
garden being one of the show places of the district.
The blossoms grew well, no doubt, on account of
the dead baby at the roots. Somehow the lady
who has dead infants found in her garden is
generally a kindly person who is always will-
ing to help an afflicted fellow-creature on his
path, and the more kindly she is the mere
dead’ infants are found in her garden. So
far, the police believe that they have traced
22’children to Mrs. Dean’s possession, and
of these eight are still unaccounted for, though
every vestige of the lovely garden has been torn
up by the roots in the search for more remains.
The. ten living children who were found on the
premises all apparently well-cared for and
religiously brought up, and on the mantelpiece
was a neatly-framed In Memoriam poem, written
by the baby-farmer herself, expressing her grief at
the death of one of her charges—a little girl who
was found planted beneath a chrysanthemum.

There was much that was jarringly in-
artistic in the deliberate display made of Violet
Varley’s funeral. The advertising of the route,
the stopping at the church, and the parade of
floral offerings whetted the popular taste for sen-
sationalism, and the result was a public exhibition
of the most vulgar curiosity The church was
packed with weeping women whose hysterics
naturally unnerved the chief mourners and made
them the centre of a scene of almost bathetic
grief. All along the line of procession, too,
stupid' women could be seen breaking away from
the crowd to trot alongside the mourning-coach
and peer in upon tenor Tapley, just to see
and say how he took his terrible trouble.
Nothing more boorishly brutal could be imagined.
Then again, the four-horsed hearse, gorgeously
plumed and appointed, the conspicuous outbreak
of mourning-coach, and the other costly provisions
of the undertaker’s art, proved a motley contrast
to the variety of strange vehicles which fol-
lowed. There seemed comparatively few well-
known faces amongst the mourners, who, for the
most part, appeared to comprise every whipper-
snapper of a city clerk who possessed the price of
a cab-fare and could get a few hours off the chain.
Mixed up as the cortege was with a State function,
a butchers’ procession, and a fashionable wedding
—State, stage, slaughter-house, and society I—the
ostentatious funeral of the poor little actress was
a garish affair, which made the poetic grieve
that it had not been decided to have a simple
burial at early morn, without a funeral oration,
without a mob of women and children already
surfeited with the sight of decorated meat-carts,
without a ton or so of wreaths, without anything
discordant whatever, and with only a few real
mourners, content to grieve unseen, and satisfied
with placing a humble violet or two upon the little
grave. # * *

The Melb. man charged with having sold
his interest in a certain estate to from two to
thirteen different persons, was released by the
Bench on general principles. The point at which
the Bencli knocked off hearing the case and threw
accused out into the street was where it tran-
spired that accused had sold his interest allegedly
for the severalth time—for =6200. The man who
advanced the money, in addition to getting what,
if it hadn’t been sold before, would have been a
very valuable property, for a mere song, appears to
have got .£2O for his trouble. A man who intro-
duced the seller to him, and another man who
acted as runner-up, got £45 between them. This
nominally left £135, but when the accused was
found in a sort of moonstruck condition by the
police very shortly afterwards, he had only 9d.,
and as his breath didn’t account for the balance
the Bench concluded that it also went in commis-
sion to somebody. So the case was thrown down
the steps on principles which might not be good
law, but which seem to be very respectable jus-
tice, anyhow.

The human body is a victim to those
dreadful enemies, the microbes, and to prevent
those treacherous foes to approach you there is no
better method than to keep yourself clean and not
allow food to decay in your mouth or the clogging
of the epidermis. To prevent these things, one of
the most leading chemists in Sweden brought out
his world-renowned Amykos, which, without
doubt, is the best toilet requisite with which to
gargle your throat, wash your mouth and face.
Amykos is strongly recommended as a preventa-
tive of sore throat and bad breath.

My Dear Moorabinda—
The monster benefit matinee, tendered as a fare-
well compliment to Mme. Soldene, at Sydney
Lyceum, last week, was not only a great success
from the bag point of view, but it was a wondrous
demonstration of the triumph of temperament over
the man with the scythe, Madame is the Parkes
of the operatic stage—the grand'old woman of
light opera. Her voice is merely the echo of its
old self, and Lady Jane’s (in “Patience”) inven-
tory of her “ spreading charms ” is not altogether
unapplicable to Madarne’s personality—yet, by
reason of her marvellous vitality and her sound
artistio methods, she still makes acceptable stage-
appearances, and kicks out a long pink train with
her French heel with all the skittisbness of two-
and-twenty. At least, so she did in “Madame
Angot,” at her ben., when she skipped through
the part of Mdlle. Lange, in a melting rose-color
dress, a big feather fan, and a luxuriant brown
wig, and filled several weary young women in the
dress-circle with the fervent hope that they would
show the same happy vigor at 37 which Madame
does at—shall I say, double that ?
The matinee was brought to a successful issue
with the ready help of a long army of artists, in-
cluding the ’Varsity amateurs—whom the wicked
gallery saw fit to guy most unmercifully. A
feature of the Soldene affair was the absence of
the Grateful Person who slides out of the wings
as the audience gets its wrap together and thanks
people “in heartfelt tones ” for being so kind as
to spend an afternoon in pursuit of amusement.
It is quite time the benefit-speech was put a stop
to j at least, it is quite time to stop thanking the
public for turning up. The only people who
ought to be warmly puffed are the actors and
actresses, who certainly deserve all the advt, they
can get out of giving their services and ensuring a
bright, attractive bill, and who are really respon-
sible tor big houses on these cordial occasions. If
you don’t believe it just watch the fate of some
“deserving object” benefit in which small fry
only take part. It’s not the beneficiary which
fetches the audience—it’s the bill.
Talking of benefits, Miss Nellie Stewart’s well-
deserved turn was billed for 12th inst., too late for
me to notice this week, but a full house is a fore-
gone conclusion. Nellie, sticking to what she
told us when she returned from ’Orae, sails back
to grasp once more at British laurels, and if the
British public know a bright, refined, and charm-
ing actress when they see her, and recognise a
sweet, expressionful soprano when they hear it,
and can respect an infinite capacity for hard work
and a determination never to disappoint the
public—then one may safely predict a walk-over
for Miss Stewart with anything like a fair chance.
Wiseacres from over the dew-drop may shake
their heads knowingly and infer that little bundles
of beauty and talent like Nellie hang on every
bush “in town,” but it seems rather odd they
don’t import them oftener instead of sending out
hopeless sticks who get strained half-way through
the season. Nellie’s departure is Florence Young’s
opportunity. I hear that the well-dressed Miss
Young will be often seen in leading r6les when
Nellie packs.
It is difficult to keep pace with the Most
Travelled’s celebrities nowadays—they tread on
one another’s heels so. The only thing I didn’t
like about Mr. Haskett-Smith (the latest) was his
hyphen ; otherwise he was a geographical and
antique treat. It is a fine thing to hear an Eng-
lish parson graciously enlightening our aboriginal
ignorance on the Holy Land without giving
exhausted “ haws ” at every comma or appearing
too feeble in the jaw to send his voice further than
the sixth row, or calling languidly on the
“Loard.” I heard Mr. Smith’s illustrated con-
versation on “ Bible Memories,” and must confess
to having passed a pleasant evening, though, mind
you, Mr. Smith is not a ladies’ man. Every
woman-anecdote he related made the eternal she
look ridiculous ; and the list culminated in a word-
picture of the New Woman on of the
Dead Sea wearing knickers, a boiled shirt, a flam-
ing red tie, and a velvet coat. Even the Bedouins
shied at her.
Mr. Smith’s photographs are exceedingly in-
teresting (anybody who wants to see the source of
the Jordan has only to go to the head of Lane
Cove River—if Mr. Smith’s snap-shots are to be
relied on), and there isn’t the least suspicion of
snivel or cant in his boldly-delivered discourse. I
think he must be the New Parson, who will have
a magic-lantern rigged up in the choir, and preach
to crowded houses with a bamboo pointer and a
white sheet, Mr. S. tells some funny stories,
which are the sort of jokes nobody but a clergy-
man, or a respectable daily paper, could tell with-
out damaging their reputation for piety. Here is
one. A hotel in Jaffa is kept by a “ character ”
who names his two wings the Old and New Testa-
ment wing, respectively ; and there are 12 mmns
in each named after the 12 tribes and the dozen
apostles. “It is interesting,” innocently said the
rev. lecturer, “ to hear mine host telling a servant
to show some lady up to Peter 1"
The only people who had a grievance at the
Fresh Air League ball (at Sydney Town Hall, the
other evening) were a handful of men whose black
coats were covered in fluff from the pampas-grass
used in the decorations. Otherwise the hall-trim-
ming was a great success—ferns in profusion, and
banana-trees, palms, and other herbs, with an under-
current of quarantine-yellow art muslin, made the
ball-room look its very best. The cosy corners
were a feature—some of them fenced in with
Japanese screens would have made ideal spooning-
placesifonly they hadn’t been arranged to accom-
modate six people ! Surely ball-committees know
that “Two is company’’ and t6te-it-t6te corners
should be built for two and not half-a-dozen.
The dressing wasn’t bad at all. The Acting-
Governoress (His Acting Ex. didn’t come) was
enshrined on the well-draped dais, and was well-
draped herself in black brocade and lace with
green-velvet sleeves, a diamond necklace and pen-
dant, the whole livened up by committee flowers.
Miss Darley wore amber satin, and her sister a
dull-looking black-and-bluish gown. Mrs. Hutton
sported blue brocade and filmy lace like cobwebs
on a clear sky—and unwisely chaperoned a thin
girl in bright green, by the way, who really
looked like a French bean on end. Mrs. Rupert
Carington sported a dolly dress of blue satin
fussed over with blue tulle and blue velvet bows.
One of the dreamiest dresses on view was worn
by Mrs. Willie Mitchell—pearly brocade with
subdued embroideries and immense clusters of
pink roses on either shoulder and at the foot of
the skirt. _ Mrs. John See wore trained ivory
brocade striped with pale spring green, the bodice
a mass of ivory lace and diamonds; Miss Marcia
Cox, in a simple black skirt with green velvet
bodice fitfully trimmed with old lace and little
bunches of violets stuck round the neck and
waist, looked artistic ; and Miss M'Donagh’s black
silk frock, brightened with flat pink velvet bows,
was most stylish. Mrs. Caro (hon. see.) wore
strawberry brocade-pink velvet and diamonds;
Mrs. Woodin (the hard-working hon. sec.) wore a
well-cut brocade; Mrs. W. Brennan, in pink
poplin, had a color-match in Essie Jenyns-Wood,
who also wore pink, with a jewelled ceinture h, la
Juliet. By the way, the “best people” didn’t
wear the off-the-shoulder sleeve. I thought they
wouldn’t.
Of course, there were some sartorial eccentrici-
ties on the crowded floor. One girl wore white
and green, with green splashboards over each
shoulder, and a head-arrangement of magenta
flowers from her crown over her right ear, and
thence round her neck ! The misguided lady evi-
dently mistook herself for a verandah - post.
Another charmer, bundled up in scarlet, had
evidently never seen Katisha, whom she exactly
resembled; and yet another sat with two gold-
washed shoes stuck out, looking as if she had just
walked through a Coolgardie gold-mine and some
of the color had stuck. Also, a lady in a red
bodice and petticoat had a most wonderful train
of black velvet with big, ugly, pink roses here and
there, as if stuck on transfer-fashion. How a
woman who wilfully bedizens her back-view with
a horrible design like that must envy a peacock
his tail-feathers ! Pink and blue were greatly
worn, and a visitress from Melbourne, in a forked-
lightning sort of frock, sported the very latest
notion—a gold muff-chain—round her neck. But
toNellie Stewart belongs whatever credit apper-
tains to introducing ’em into Australia.
I thought a mourning-veil hung over “La
Cigale,” at Sydney Lyceum last Saturday, when
the grasshopper opera went up. Nobody could
help thinking of poor, pretty Yi. Varley
who last played the fusty part of Marton
for us (she really sang all the summer and
died in the winter like the grasshopper in the
fable) and the appearance of the ever-ready Bracy
in Tapley’s part, as the Chevalier, helped to keep
one reminiscency throughout the piece. “Cigale”
was brilliantly staged, and Miss Stewart gave an
entirely new and charming reading of the name-
part. What may be described as the gooseflesh
effects introduced into the last verse of “One
between Three ” resulted in that quaint ditty
having to be repeated three times, while the
dramatic scene in the last act has never before
been so tellingly rendered—Miss Stewart’s artistic
pallor very much helping the effect. I liked Nellie
as La Cigale.
The dressing was most aggressive after the first
act. In act 2 Miss Stewart sported honey-color
satin helped out with white and gold tissue, a big
white hat with white and silver feathers, and a
pair of full brothers to “ O dem golden slippers,' 1
immortalised in minstrelsy, on her tiny feet. Flo
Young, as the Duchess, ran about the stage in old
gold striped brocade, with a mottled-lobster petti-
coat, and a big brown hat with maroon roses and
brown feathers. Miss Young is a very fine figure
of a girl, but even Juno irritates you when she
tears about the stage in the aimless hurry of a
just-set-a-going mechanical toy, which is a fault
Miss Young has lately fallen into. The men have
a shy at silks and satins in “Cigale,” In act 2
Bracy, of the sweet, reliable tenor, wore a splendid
satin suit profusely trimmed with shoe-laces, and
Vernon, as the Duke, was very gorgeous, only
that his frivolous handkerchief was three sizes too
large for the tra-la-la occasion. One looked for a
lacey trifle, not a head-cold-bandanna, under the
frisky circumstances. Apropos of the flinty duke,
that largely-patronised children’s party he gives
looks a most probable sort of entertainment for a
duke of his proclivities to inaugurate.
In the last act, Miss Young was rigidly elegant
in eau-de-nil brocade, with huge bunches of pink
flowers over a pink skirt, veiled in coffee-color
lace, pink roses, and diamonds by the spoonful.
Nellie Stewart’s gown was a white brocade,
out Juliet-wise, thickly ruched at both ends
with yellow roses, which also formed arm-
lets; a draped train from the right shoul-
der of pale green, embossed in gold and
caught with yellow roses, was lined with yellow
satin. Diamonds to conclude. Dost like the pic-
ture? I did. With every apology to Lauri (who
made his usual success of the Uncle), I think the
funniest thing occurred in the Ist act. “Como
along, children,” chirped the only Nellie, “and
whoever’s first gets the pick of the plums! ”
Thereupon May Pollard (the “ Ant”) is heard to
groan, “Then good-bye to the cherry tree ! ”
Evidently tigs grow on thistles in Scotland. Sid
Deane was Vincent (“Vonsong ” in the first act,
but “Viscount” afterwards) in place of idol
Brownlow, and people groaned in spirit when he
turned up to make love to Nellie, though it was
satisfactory, in one way—it made the lady’s persis-
tent refusal of his unmodulated affection look the
most natural thing on earth.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

PROFESSOR ROBERTS’ GAUGER GORE.
An absolntn cure for all “ EXTERNAL ” Cancer. The only known remedy for this frightful disease. The preparation is made from a herb indigenous to South Africa alone, and used by the nativ >
tribes for the cure of the said disease. If applied in time it will effect a certain cure, guaranteed by the proprietor*. This remedy may be applied by the sufferer, without the aid of a doctor, and
causes no inconvenience beyond the requisite attention necessary to its application. It will eliminate all cancerous poison from the system, and will literally draw out the cancer itself, thus doing away
with the surgeon’s knife, which at best is uncertain.
Postal Address: Box 316 G.P.0., Melbourne.
Also, the Great I F vgeo Bio-Ohemic Remedy
(NOT SCHUSSLER’S).
Money and Health Saved without the aid of Doctors or Drugs.
The ONLY cure for what is called INCURABLE disease, such as Bright’s, Diabetes, Gravel, also Incipient Consumption, Asthma, Rheumatism, Constipation, Piles, General Debility, all nervous
troubles, including Heart Disease, and in particular DYSPEPSIA, the cause of all the above so-called disease and the CURSE of life. How few know that dyspepsia is PUTREFACTION i.e.
fermentation of the food both in stomach and intestines? The blood being made from this putrid matter, is it any wonder that disease follows ? With all the boasted knowledge of the nineteenth century'
as many people die to-day as a hundred years ago, because, as the venerable Professor Alexander H. Stevens, M.D., of New York, said recently to his medical class, “ The science of medicine has failed
owing to the fact that physicians HAVE STUDIED THE WRITINGS of their predecessors instead of Nature.” Professor Parker also declares : —“ As we place more confidence in NATURE, and less
in preparations of the apothecary, MORTALITY DIMINISHES.” And Dr. Allin«on, M.D., of London, who prescribes through the medium of The Times and Echo and other papers never advises
drugs, but in all cases the use only of hygienic methods—that is “ attention to Nature’s laws ” —which, in spite of physic, “ heals herself.” See what she does for a broken limb or a cut “if bound up in its
blood.” New tissue will form and the bone will heal itself. The Bio-chemic Remedy is founded on simple facts, and appeals to common sense. It is absolutely harmless and never fails in removing the
CAUSE of disease, and consequently the disease itself disappears, and thus restores the sufferer to comparative health. THESE LIFE-GIVING SALTS (the phosphates found by analysis in healthy
blood, but which are destroyed in the fermentation) are projected by INJECTION on the membranes of the colon, and are thus carried by absorption into the whole circulation of the system. The principle
of the treatment is based on the well-known value of the “ mineral baths ” (the minerals of whose waters are ALL supposed to do good, whatever the nature of the disease), at the same time only an
infinitesimal portion can possibly be absorbed through the skin, as the skin is a medium by which EFFETE matter is given off from the body. Whereas the Bio-cbemic Salts, the actual components of THE
BLOOD, are brought directly into the CIRCULATION, hence this ‘‘new method ”is of infinite value. Be it remembered, there is but one disease, THE BLOOD poisoned by the retention of effete
matter in the system, the symptoms legion. Remember, not an atom of drugs is used in the Bio-chemic Remedy. Our book of instruction, together with all necessary appliances, will be forwarded on
receipt of £2, which will cover ALL Costs for ALL time. The salts supplied gratis until recovery.

“ That which we call a rose, by any other
name would smell as sweet,” and so it
happens that we want to explain what
is MYFA? It is only a name,
the new name for Mitchell’s
“My Favorite” Tea. Why do
we change the name ? Simply to
protect you from fraud. The success of
“My Favorite” Tea has been
gigantic ; its immense popularity is so
pronounced that it has numbers of imita-
tors already, who have neither the brains
nor the inclination to get an original
name of their own
A recent decision of the Supreme Court has revealed the fact that the
words “ My Favorite ” can be used by anybody, and we have therefore, in
order to prevent your being misled into buying “Favorite” Tea, and
thinking it the celebrated blend of Mitchell’s, decided to change the name
for one that cannot be held by anyone else. .
MITCHELL’S “MY FAVORITE” Tea will be sold in future under the
name of MYFA TEA (copyright).
We positively guarantee “ MYFA TEA ” to be the identical Tea hitherto
sold as MITCHELL’S “MY FAVORITE.” What’s in a Name P A good
deal. Be warned! In future, when you wish to purchase MITCHELL’S
“MY FAVORITE” Tea, ask for
MYFA

THE RABBIT INVASION!
Melbourne Agk of 12bh February, 1895, published the following telegram :
Alburv, Monday.—Good evidence is forthcoming that some recent bush fires in the northern part of Riverim
have been occasioned through the ignition of the phosphorus used for rabbit poisoning. A fire which is supposed to .
have originated by this means destroyed over 30,000 acres of grass.
TOXA, the only scientific destroying specific, has no inflammable constituents. TOXA WILL NOT.'
IGNITE, either spontaneously or otherwise. Horses, Cattle and Sheep WILL NOT EAT TOXA. This poison,
is SAFE, EFFICACIOUS® and CHEAP ; cheapn as is incomp (ible with risk or uncertainty. Ilalf-a-ciownV

Dear Bulletin, —There are other than
bank-managers selling saveloys. Fancy four ex-

Dear Bulletin, —Sydney had better get
along without a Chinese detective. Melbourne
had one—Book Shing—who, for all valuable pur-
poses, proved a failure. He was useful enough as
an interpreter, but, when it came to real business,
he was as much fogged as the Caucasian D. It
might have been different had he not become
Anglicised in Beaufort coat, tweed trousers, &c.;
as soon as he did, ho lost that touch with his
fellow Mongols which is essential to the investi-
gator of Chinese crime. Unless Sydney can get
a Chow content to remain a Chow and act the D.
at the same time, it’s no use making any experi-
ment.—Yours, Cop.

A Dunedin (M.L.) debt-collector was lately
taken down by a Chinaman. He had to collect a
debt of <£l from one (say) Too Kwid, greengrocer.
He had called repeatedly at Too Kwid’s, but was
told T.K. was “ ill,” or “just gone out,” and was
going to prepare a summons. But one morning a
knowing Celestial called on the collector, and made
known to him that he could get in T.K.’s money
if the collector would allow him something for his
trouble—say, give him a receipt for 20s. and accept
13s. He also promised to see the matter settled in
a week’s time, but it might take longer, as Too
Kwid - was a hard nut. The collector agreed he
would take anything rather than sue a Chinaman.
The debt-collecting Clunky called sure enough at
the quoted time with 13s. and demanded receipt
for 20s. It occurred to the business man that it
would be as well to get his Chinese co-worker’s
name before he left, as he might come in useful for
future transactions. “Isay,” he asked, “what’s
j/ourname?” “Name me?” said the Chinaman,
half-way out of the door—“me Too Kwid.”

It is hard to furnish your home at Walhalla,
the Vic. township where your windows look
down the next-door chimney-flues. Some time
ago a local schoolmaster wished to put a piano
into his drawing-room. It took three days, 12
bullocks, and two men to get it from the base to
the mountain-top, and another two days to lower
it down by ropes to the level of the dominie’s
home.

Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the Sydney Bulletin a gentleman whose test,
monv carries special weight, writes thus : To Herr Rassmusskn.— Dear Sir -I think it my-duty to
inform you that a course of your Alfalme Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my nervous
and inconsequence, I have recommended them to many friends, who have all been cured by their
use. —Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.

160 Elizabeth-st., Melb., July 18, 1892.
Dear Sirl have much pleasure to inform you that a course of,
your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention that several of my fnem s
to whom I have recommended your remedies have derived great benet t
from them; therefore, I consider you are deserving of success, wmcn
I do most heartily wish you. t t>

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Here Rassmussen. March 15th, 1854.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. r ihanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper of
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

Theatre, Castlereagh-street, Sydney.
A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 18711 was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, ai d free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Great Debility and Weakness Cured.
51 Barkly-street, Ballarat, Victoria, Aug. 29, 1892.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.
A Lady’s Wish Fulfilled.
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform you that your cele-
brated Alfaline Universal Pills cured me, when all other remedies and
doctors failed, of a stubborn case of Debility of 18 years’ standing. My
wish is fulfilled at last, and I don’t know how to thank you enough.
Dear Sir, I shall recommend your Alfaline Remedies to all sufferers I
come across. You are quite at liberty to publish or make what use you
like of this testimonial, and anyone writing to me will have full
particulars. I am, yours respectfully, Mrs. E. SMITH, Port Mac-
quarie, Hastings River, N.S.W.
A Miraculous Cure.
The father of Mr. Peter Larsen, the celebrated Bandmaster to the Queensland
Military, writes as follows:
Ithaca-st., Normanby Hill, Brisbane, Sept. 20, 1892.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,—l am jubilant to inform you that your wonderfu
Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a very obstinate internal com
plaint; and that, although I am now over 70 years of ago, I feel a
strong as any young man, and shall always be grateful to you.
Yours very truly, N. LARSEN.

standing.—Yours gratefully, H. TOST.

benefit of other similar sufferers.*
Yours gratefully, JAMES NELSON WILLIAMS.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Though St. Alban’s Wilson has nine in Melb.
Clap, it will not be known for a few weeks whether any of
them will carry his colors, Tatt.’s lottery having yet to
decide future ownership. The stable is represented by
half-a-dozen in the Caulfield Cup also.
• • ♦ *
The wealthy Mr. Gollan is the second hvrgest
nominator in Melb. Cup, having five to pay for. One
thing noticeable is the defection of the barbed-wire-tera-
pered brute, Sternchaser, whose second to Portsea in the
Australian Cup, after making the running all the way for
nis stable mate, Culloden, will ever be remembered.
Pounamu (now in M.L.) represents the stable in Stern-
chaser’s place. He is a beautiful horse, by Newminster
Beryl (full sister to Nordenfeldt, whose rather sudden
death is the turf sensation of the week).
* * * *
Mr. Sam Hordern’s celebrated race - horse
Stallion, Nordenfeldt, which has died of paralysis, con-
sequent on an accident, could, it is said, have been sold
within the last few months for at least three times the
6600 guineas paid for him by his owner. Mr. Hordern,
who has 52 youngsters by Nordenfeldt out of high-class
mares, 24 of which are believed to be again in foal to the
departed, is in treaty in England for a successor to the
dead stallion.
• • • •
The National horses doing the best work at
Flemington, so far, are Dundee and Dairaio, and the touts
at Flemington swear by them for the double. Dairaio
especially is doing splendid work, and seems to have
enough foot to win a decent fiat race.
* ♦ • •
The latest dodge of the Melb. starting-price
brigade. The owner of a horse arranges with his com-
missioners to put so much on his horse at S.P. He then
goes to the course, but stays on the flat. As his horse is not
backed inside, and as the flat prices always follow the
paideck ditto, he gets on outside at a long price, and is
sure to get good odds for the money invested in town by
his S.P. commissioners.

Of the sires, Gozo was again the hero of the day
at Randwick on Saturday, when his offspring, Messmate
and Cradle, won the double —Duckenfield and Randwick
Stakes respectively. Gozo’s get—Pilot Boy, Sadur, Mess-
mate, and Cradle—have placed a nice little sum in stakes
to his credit during the past few weeks. What price his
next batch of yearlings?
* » • •
On dit that the most unlucky of Australian race-
horse owners is about to sell off his stud. He has raced
for years—spent thousands getting the best—yet he could
count his wins on his fingers. Several young Carbines
will be included in the list.
* * • •
“When that gilded Australian, Mr. William
Cooper, sold his horse Kirkconnel because he thought he
was inferior to Raconteur, I wrote,” remarks The Bul-
letin’s correspondent, “ that I believed he was wrong,
and that more unlikely things might happen than the
colt winning two at least of the classic races—adding that
I should not like to speak to Mr. Cooper if his discarded
horse won either the Two Thou, or Derby. What I pre-
dicted has happened. Kiikconnel easily defeated a smart
field for the Two Thousand, including the dreaded
Raconteur. Cooper’s face was a sight for the gods when
he saw the colt pass the post, and bring back to Blundell
Maple, in stakes and bets, much more than he paid for
the animal. Such bad losers as Cooper should never own
a horse. His brother, Daniel, is a much more philosophic
sportsman.”
* ♦ * •
The Yankees, Dwyer and Croker, took a nice
tittle sum out of the ring by the win of Banquet 11. in the
Two Thousand Trial Stakes at Newmarket (writes The
Bulletin’s London correspondent). They don’t seem to
be particular as to price when they have a real good thing
on. The ways of Campbell, their trainer, are a puzzle to
the old-fashioned school. For instance, w'ithin half-an-
hour of Banquet 11. starting for the race named he was
given half a pail of water, and after a short rest was sent
a full-speed gallop over five furlongs. After this he was
clothed and allowed to sweat, and without even waiting
to rub him dry he was started for the race, which he won
comfortably. They took as little as 5 to 4 about him.
But they had a bad fall when their chosen one, Montauk,
which was backed heavily, was beaten. The stable com-
mission was over £6OOO. A duel between them and the
bookies can only end one way.
* * • *
It was the mysterious Mr. Granville Lloyd, of
Australia (writes The Bulletin’s London correspon-
dent), who offered £lO,OOO for Raconteur. He in-
structed William Allison not alone to make a bid for
Raconteur, but to make an offer to Machell for a lot—-10
or 12 —of his horses, including Ravensbury. The price
asked was comparatively modest, and had itbeen genuine
business the buyer would not have had much the worst of
the deal with the 'Jubilee Stakes in view, for which
Ravensbury has a good chance.
Sir Visto’s Derby-win will resurrect British
punters’ buried faith in the “third for the Guineas.”
Lord Falmouth twice pulled off the Epsom prize with
non-favorites that had finished No. 3 in the mile race at
Newmarket, so it became for a time the proper thing for
horse-reporters to discover vast possibilities of improve-
ment in No. 3, whereas No. 1 and 2 were described as
“ thoroughly wound up” and not likely to be any filter
on Derby-day. But at length the public grew weary of
expecting animals to win a Derby for the particular reason
that they had been badly beaten a month earlier. “ Third
for the Guineas ” proved a “rotter” as often_as not.

Judging by the times put up by the Sydney
trotters now in Maoriland, it would appear that there is
something queer about either the tracks or the watches.

Lillie Bridge has placed a pony-trot on its pro-
gramme for Monday afternoon next, but the proprietors
have made a mistake in running it off in the afternoon.
Most of the trotting owners or riders, not being profes-
sional horsemen, have their work to attend to in the day-
time.
♦ * * ♦
Some good spins are usually seen between the
trotters coming home from Ooogee on Sunday afternoons.
Last Sunday Edith and Fairboy got together and had a
neck-and-neok mile from Randwick Course to the Zoo.
It was a great go, and a few such on the race-track in the
past might have gone a long way to popularise trotting
with the crowd.

The Australasian points out that 13 jockeys

A movement is on foot in England to present a
“shilling-testimonial" to W. G. Grace, and it is sug-
gested that Australia Should join in. Grace is a splendid
cricketer and a fine man, liut if Australia joins in testi-
monialising him it won’t be because he was personally
popular here. His manners were dingo-like.

Boundary umpires were tried in Melb. for the
first time at the charity football matches. In addition to
the game being faster and more open, the central umpire
is saved much hard work by their employment, and is
better able to enforce fair play. The one disadvantage is
the expense of seven umpires as against three.
• * * •
The football-match, Paddington Electorate v.
Wallaroo, on Sydney Cricket Ground last Saturday, ended
in a surprising win for Paddington by 12 points to 0.
Individually, the Wallaroos are a fine team, but as a com-
bination they are a failure. Paddington frequently ran
over them.
• • * *
Secy. Rand, of N.S.W. Rugby Union, who has
played the game for 14 years, gives up for good this
season. For long he was wing forward to the Wallaroos.
Five years ago he met with the footballer’s frequent ac-
cident—a broken collar-bone. He retires for lack of time
to train.
• * * *
The Cup offered to the Sydney footballers by
the management of Sydney Cricket Ground has to be won
three times. Randwick has scored two wins, University
one ; and as Randwick is stronger this year, it prou ises
to win the Cup right out. Whiteside, of M.L , who
•went to England with the Maori team, is one of Rand-
wick’s new players. Another Sydney team remarkably
strong this year is the Pirates.

The cycle race on Sydney cricket-ground last
Saturday brought 24 men to the front. The race was a
very fine one: the pace fast, and the riders’ judgment
particularly good. Megson rode in brilliant form, only to
finish fourth ; Williams, who had 115 yards handicap, won
by a length from Neil Matterson, who beat Phelan by a
few inches. Value of prize, £lO. The winner is captain
of the N.S.W. League of Wheelmen, and is a tailor by
occupation. About two years ago he won the first
amateur cash cycle race held in Sydney—worth £4O.
* * « *
R. Lewis, on Redfern (Sydney) track last week,
put up a properly authenticated mile on his bike in 2min.
8 l-sth sec. Some idea of the pace may be gauged from
the fact that Lewis’s time is a shade of a second faster
than the trotting record held so long by the American
wonder, Maud S.

Apparently the S. Adelaides have a mortgage-
on S.A. football premiership this year, like Essendon had
in Melb. for so long. The “Sowths” are playing with
the cream of Adelaide footballers this season, and the
only team likely to push them is the always consistent
and once mighty Norwoods.

Cyclist Zimmerman : “ Courage, both moral
and physical, can be gained and cultivated if diligently
pursued. Courage is needed not only in racing, hut in
deciding when not to race. If, saj', a man is riding a
two-mile race and at half-a-mile from the finish the men
begin to sprint, and he finds he’s physically not strong
enough to stand the strain, he should stop; but if for
lack of courage he allows his mental powers to urge him
on in his endeavors to come in a winner, he may do him-
self great harm.” Megson, of N.S.W., needs Zim.’s
philosophy. Megson, when out of form, rode so
desperately in one race that he had to give up at last
because he simply couldn’t see where he was going. The
ground was whirling and surging under him, and before
and around him was a great blurr through which the silks
of the leading men occasionally flashed.

That well-known pigeon -shot and all-round
sport, Mr. Fred. Gannon, travelled in the train the other
day with Geo. Garland, “ Billy ” Frost, and a few other
horsey men. Guessing the duration of a minute was the
topic, and Gannon, pulling out his chronograph, said he
didn’t think any man could guess nearer than ssecs. three
times running. Garland said he could time it to the tick,
and surprised Mr. Q. by three times guessing the minute
exactly. Frost was sitting in the corner of the carriage
next to Garland reading the evening paper, and, taking
his watch out behind the paper, without appearing to
join in the conversation, had each time with a nudge told
Garland when to stop. Gannon got out at Tempe, en-
thusiasticaboutGarland’sability as a timist. When such an
astute personage as Mr. Gannon can be so easily deceived,
who can wonder at the poor countryman being taken
down by confidence “guns.”

mouth, teeth, and skin clean and sweet, gives no
chance for impurities to lodge and grow into
disease. Amykos has just obtained at Tasmanian
Exhibition the first-class certificate which it had
previously secured from every person using it.

WONDERFUL
Blood-Purifying Effect
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
Mr. Charles Stephenson, a well-known
Railway Employe at Kaiapoi,
New Zealand, writes:
“About ten years ago, while engaged in
shunting, my foot caught between the rails,
and my leg was fractured below the knee.
It healed in time, but I have been troubled
ever since with swollen veins, and have been
obliged, at times, to wear a bandage. About
a year ago it became much worse, and I
feared I should be obliged to give up my
work. A friend advised me to try Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. I did so, and after taking four
bottles the swelling disappeared, and I have
not been troubled with it since.”

“ It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to toll you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Benger's Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ‘ Benger's
Food." From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”
“If every mother knew of
its value no other would be

It is not generally known that
the Australian Chinese have a matri-

a paper is regularly issued thence

Rev. Joseph Parker, who has
made himself notorious in England
by his avowed belief in the Scrip-
tures, urges the British Govt, to de-
clare a holy war against Turkey in
consequence of the alleged Armenian
atrocities. If Joseph ever hears the
stories knocking about as to how
nat.ves have been treated in parts of
Australia, he will probably inspire
Rosebery to bombard Sydney, Mel-
bourne, and Brisbane. But possibly,
being a Biitisher, Joseph can dis-
criminate between atrocities in
Armenia and “ healthy discipline ” in
Australia.

To give the other and best possible side of
a somewhat lugubrious picture. J. A. Sims, late
of Rockhampton, writes from Lane’s Colonia
Cosine ; “ We are now arrived at a stage which
may be termed self-supporting. We live mainly
on beans, maudioca, maize, vegetables, and
monkey. Stewed monkey is excellent, resembling
fowl. Some of our bullocks have been sacrificed
for food. . . . Our leather, hoots and shoes,
we make ourselves. Our regular working days are
five per week, of eight hours each. We have a
newspaper, Evening Notes, which is read every
evening. Occasionally there is a little disagree-
ment, but the bitter feeling and disgraceful im-
putations of selfishness and jobbing current in
New Australia are entirely absent. We have just
finished a very enjoyable Christinas festival.”

A NEW VIRTUE
Has been discovered in
jpcm'
♦Vhich will be welcomed by all who regularly
keep it in their houses ; in the first symptons of
Influenza, some Homocca, quantity immaterial,
applied in the nostrils has been found to check
the further spread of this distressing malady,
and in a very few hours the system is
able to eject the infection and prevent further
mischief.
It will stop a painful Influenza
cold almost like magic.
m
m
m
A cold begins with inflammation of the membra-
neous lining of the intricate little passages of the
nose (which is a Hampton Court labyrinth on a
small scale). Homocea at once subdues the in-
flammation by reducing the swelling, and thereby
relieving the feeling .of “stuffiness." Moreover, it
forms a protective covering for the delicate mem-
brane, and prevents cold air, fog, or other irritating
vapour from getting at it. In influenza, Homocea
acts in the same way, and here the germ-killing
properties of the ointment further come into play.
Not much is known about the way in which influ-
enza originates, but it is quite clear that it is caused
by an invisible germ or microbe of some kind.
Homocea may,therefore, be confidently recomended
both as a cure and a preventive of influenza.
Stiff Joints, Pains in the Back, Lumbago,
Strained Muscles, Cramps, can be got rid
of at once by Homocea, which instantly
touches the spot afflicted. Homocea as a
pain relieving, soothing, and curative
lubricant has no equal in the world of
healing remedies; it is a specific for
Rheumatism, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Pa-
ralysis, Convulsions, Bruises, Strained
Muscles, Pains in the Joints, Aches and
Sprains, Eczema, Burns, Tooth-ache,
Face-ache, Chilblains, Piles, Boils,
Ulcers, Stings, Chaps, and all kindred ills
and complaints.
Henry M. Stanley writes : “ Whitehall,
London. Dear Sir, Your ointment called
* Homocea ’ was found to be the most soothing
and efficacious unguent that I could possibly
have for my fractured limb, as it seems to retain
longer than any other, that oleaginousness so
requisite for perfect and efficient massage. The
fault of embrocations generally, is that they
harden and require warmth, whereas yours,
besides being particularly aromatic, is as soft as
oil, and almost instantly mollifying in the case
of severe inflammation.
“ Yours faithfully, Henry M. Stanley.”
“ Homocea ” should be kept in every
Family Medicine Cupboard , handy for
night or day emergencies .
“ Homocea ” is so id in two sizes by
all Storekeepers, General Dealers,
and Chemists.

THE SANDY-WHISKERED BLOKE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 and the sandy-whiskered bloke
Met close beside a backblox gate,
As neither of us had a moke
He asked me “ Would I be his mate?”
He saw my empty tucker-bag,
a “ ® etter have a feed,” says he,
And so I dropped my cursed swag
And had a welcome pint of tea.
He had some johnnies steaming hot
And mutton on a hoop-iron grill,
bays he, “ You’d better scoff the lob.”
And then, when I had scoffed my fill,
And stretched my carcase on the ground
To give my knocked-up bones a rest,
He asked “ which way I might be bound ”
“ n( i “ how things looked about the West.”
At Barker’s shanty could they tell
Of any drovers coming up,”
Because he “ had a dog to sell—
A little beauty of a pup.”
“ He’d saved, at thirty-bob a week,”
A cheque that he would try and hold,
lor he was bound to Walleye Creek
lo raise an ounce or two of gold.
He had a pound or two to spare ;
We’d “ try the diggings for a while,”
And what he had we’d gladly share
In reg’lar old colonial style,
And stand a show to make a pile.
And we could live like fighting-cocks,
For Walleye Creek was full of fish,
Great sleepy cod among the rocks—
What better could a fellow wish?
We camped beneath a Moreton ash,
And after midnight pretty late
1 woke to hear a rending crash—
The tree had fallen on my mate,
And when I tried to chop him loose,
Quite breathless with the pain, bespoke—
‘lt’s not worth while. It ain’t no use.
My legs and back and ribs is broke.
Jammed like a rat beneath a log—
The only cure’s a dose of lead.
Here, matey, take the little dog,
And take the purse beneath my head.”
He tried a dose of lead ? He did.

“HAVE MERCY!”—ANOTHER VERSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN].
Oh, ’Chaser, in your onward flight,
Charge not the rails with nose in air,
But steady down and take a sight,
Shorten your stride and jump ’em fair,
Go at your fences cool and wary—
Have mercy on the man you carry.
Wild Stockhorse, mad with six months’ spell,
Don’t race through timber quite so free;
A slower pace will do as well
To put your rider up a tree.
At the blind gullies turn or tarry—
Have mercy on the man you carry.
Oh, Outlaw, on the station found
Saddled and bridled for the fray,
When once your man is on the ground
Don’t bash his brains out in your play.
Befleot! Perhaps the wretch is married—
Have mercy on the man you carried.
And, Hackney, stumbling on the road,
Go pleasanter. Hold up, you dog I
Bespect your aching flesh-galled load,
And mitigate that bumping jog ;
To nicer gaits your paces vary—
Have mercy on the man you carry.

’Twas in a Western “ ten by ten
A red-soil ridge with scanty trees
Bose up before me, and again
Beyond I thought I heard the seas.
I climbed and saw a sea indeed —
A sea of scrub and whitened grass;
But sea of which my soul had need,
Naught ’neath that sky of molten brass,

She seemed a eirl of steadfast heart
As I gazed in her great grey eyes.
How could I tell she played a part,
And deemed me but a gilded prize ?
I loved her—and I thought I saw
Her inmost mind before me pass.
God ! when at length new-wed, I knew
Her soul was like that withered grass.

Down ! And the world’s war-squadron splashes
Past, loose-reined, in the blood and the mire,
Brown arms sweep and the bared steel flashes
On to the goal of the world’s desire.
Down ! By the war-steed’s hot hoofs cowering.
Broken the sword-arm, bent the sword,
And away to the front leap the sabres showering
Blows for the hell-hearth, blows for the Lord !
Has he clutched at the moon for jewel
To bind on his bosom and wear ?
Has he fought with a Fate too cruel
And followed a face too fair ?
No matter the reason why,
He is down, and it’s little the world will care
As it sweeps in a foam-fret by.
Down ! Weeps the moon, and he never wore it,
Down ! And the stars mourn into the mist.
Fate’s red weal is across his forehead—
Somebody’s face has never been kissed !
Flushes the dawn, and one vulture-speck
Spires and spins in a reeling sky ;
Down ! And it’s little the world will reck
As it rides red-rowelled by.

year, and a naval staff which costs about .£29,000
annually, and it will have to pay the salaries of
these potentates until their engagements expire,
and feel as well as it can about them.
THE HANDFUL OF THINGS WE KNOW
Several years ago an American humorist and poet
published some verses called “Little Breeches.”
This was an odd name given to a very small boy
who was caught out in a tremendous snowstorm,
and finally found in some hay quite a distance from
the house. However the boy got there bothered
everybody to explain. It was certain he never
could have walked. So his father said the angels
must have done it; “ they just stooped down and
toted him to where it was safe and warm,” he said.
The poetry about it (supposed to have been written
by the youngster’s father) starts off in this way :
I don’t go much on religion,
I never ain’t had no show ;
But I’ve a middling tight grip, sir,
On the handful of things I know.
That’s it ; the handful of things we know. There
aren’t many of ’em, but there are a few. And one
of them is this : That for a hundred results there
is only one cause. Nature developes and makes
differences; never a new force.
Here, for example, is an incident which shows
our meaning. About Christmas, 1889, Mr. E. B.
Wright had an attack of influenza. Previous to
this he had always been strong and hearty. Well
he got over the influenza; still, it had given him
(as he says) “a shake.” After this he got along
fairly Well, until February,of this year (1892) when
the influenza attacked him again. This time the
malady “meant business.” Nearly every bone
and muscle in his body ached like sore teeth. His
skin was hot and dry, and to bed he was obliged
to go. For sixteen days he was under a doctor.
At the end of that time he found himself alive
and that was about all you could say for him.
In his letter he goes on to tell what happened
next. “I had a foul taste in the mouth,” he says,
“and my teeth and tongue were covered with a
thick slimy phlegm. My wife says my tongue
was like an oyster-shell, and I’m sure it was rough
as a nutmeg grater. What I ate, which wasn’t
much, gave me pain in the chest and sides. After
a mouthful or two I felt full and blown out, and
I used to swell to a great size. By-and-by a
hacking cough set in and my breathing got short
and quick. At night I lay for hours gasping for
breath, and often coughed so I was afraid I should
burst a blood vessel. I got weaker and weaker and
was like a broken-ivinded horse. The doctor said
it was asthma, but he wasn’t able to relieve it.
Although I live only two minutes’ walk from the
factory where I work, 1 had to stop and rest on
my way many a time.
“Thus matters went with me until June, 1892.
Then one day I took up the Essex Newsman, and
read of a man living at Barsham, near Bungay,
having been cured by Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup. I got some of this medicine from, the
International Tea Company, Braintree. After a
few doses my breathing grew easier, and by
keeping on with the Syrup my food soon digested,
the cough left me, and I gained strength. lam
now as strong as ever, can eat anything, and walk
for miles. lam a brushmaker, and work at the
factory of Messrs. John West and Sons, High
Street, Braintree, and have lived in this town over
forty years. (Signed) E. B. Weight, Sandpit
Hoad, Braintree, Essex, August 23rd, 1892.”
Now let us see how this illustrates the proposi-
tion we started out with. For almost three years
Mr. Wright was ill with what seemed like a series
of different diseases. He had the influenza twice,
the asthma once, and another disease which he
gives no name to—even if he recognised it. Look
for a moment at the variety and incongruity of the
pains and troubles he mentions, and he doesn’t
describe them all, either. You would fancy he
had half a dozen ailments at least. Yet he had
but one— indigestion and dyspepsia—of which all
his bodily disturbances (influenza included—a
blood disease) were symptoms. All came out of
the stomach, and when Seigel’s Syrup set that
right the others quietly departed.
What, then, is one thing of “ the handful of
things we know ?” Answer: That nearly all
sorts of diseases are really symptoms of indigestion
and dyspepsia, and that Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup cures it.
Double that fact up in your fist and hold on to
It tight.

An Australian at ’Ome :—Last Sunday, at
Hampton Court, on the Thames, I was treated to
a strange and unaccustomed sight. Two insipid-
scented johnnies (one eye-glassed) lolled in the
stern of a heavy 20ft. boat, while one of the
brave-and-free—a poor devil of a laborer, with a
pallid face—laboriously dragged them along from
the bank. The tugging of the line round his
shoulders had chafed his ragged shirt to his skin,
and when, at the end of a long, heart-breaking
drag, the free-born human mule was stopped,
the scented sons of a generous race rewarded him
with —a shilling.— Dryblo web.

The Westralian Gold-Boom, — In a
W.A. Pawnshop,
[FOR THE BULLETIN].
Time, 9 o’clock, Saturday evening. Behind the
counter, a fair-haired chubby-faced Australian
boy. The proprietor, an Israelite with 100 per
shunt written all over his face, sits on a chair in a
room off the shop.
Enter a poor, haggard-looking, shabbily-dressed
woman with one child in her arms and two other
children, poorly-clad, trailing on to her shirts.
Boy: “You here again! You live in this
shop. ”
Woman: “Yds; haven’t had a word from my
husband yet, although he has been gone these
three months to Ooolgardie.”
Boy (cheerfully): “Ah! perhaps he’s dead.
Lots of fever up there.”
Woman; “For God’s sake, don’t say that!
He’s a good husband when sober, and, when he
dies, may the Lord grant that my three children
and myself die also ! We would starve to death
if we didn’t.” (Cries).
Mr. Mosenstein : “Don’t chry here, my goot
vouwn? Spoils my bithness. Veil, vot have you
got thith time? Hey !”
Woman : “ The only thing left me in the world’s
my wedding-ring. There’s nothing in the house,
the bailiff’s got all my furniture, and you’ve got
the family Bible, my jewellery, and all the chil-
dren’s, and my Sunday clothes and boots.”
Mr. M. : “Veil, let me thee the ring 1”
She (pulling it off and handing it to him): “ It’s
enough to make my poor mother turn in her
grave to see her only child pawning her marriage-
ring. It oost £3 when new.”
Mr. M. : “That’s 20 years ago.”
She (sharply); “ Indeed it’s only seven. I’m
only 25.”
Mr. M, : “Yell, you look 50! Vot you vaut
on it?”
She; “A pound.”
Mr. M. : “A pound 1 Do you vant to ruin
me? I’ll give you three bob. Not a penny
more.”
She: “Say five shillings to keep us from starving
for another week. I’m sure to hear then from my
husband, and will pay all back.”
Mr. M. i “ No.”
Then she begins to coax him, asking him “ how
he would like to see his wife in such a position,”
but, of course, he couldn’t imagine such a thing.
No one thoroughly seized of the beauty and the
glory of the compound-interest table ever could.
She snatches up the three shillings and walks
quickly out of the shop, one of the children re-
marking : “Mother, you’re not going to let that
nasty old man keep your pretty ring. What
would father say 1 ”
Then there enters the shop a travel-stained
digger with a swag. His clothes are studded with
stains of red dust, his boots burst in all directions.
His hands and face are badly mosquito bitten, his
eyes almost closed with sandy blight. Evidently
just finished a tramp from Ooolgardie.
Digger, to boy : “ Matey, for Christ’s sake lend
me ten bob on this swag till Monday, when I hope
to get a bit.”
Mr. M. : “ Vy do you insult us ven you vant to
porro monish from us ? Another swag 1 That
ith the fortieth I have lent on this very night. All
Ooolgardie vath coming to my shop this ev’nin’.
All I can lend is two thillings.”
Digger ; “ How can a chap carry througli Sun-
day »n two bob? Make it five shillings. It oost
me a couple o’ notes, and it’s quite new.”
Mr. M. ; “You vas pawning now, not buying.
Take two thillings or leave them.”
He took them.
Herr Arenalt, an exuberant German, tells
his brother senators that Great Britain, under the
leadership of Balfour, will ultimately abandon
monometallism. Michael Davitt says “Great
Britain isn’t built that way.” She lias nothing
to gain from bimetallism, and the thing which
she has nothing to gain from she doesn’t believe in.
Archbishop Carr gives the A rgus an ex-
planation of what the Pope means by indulgences
to the faithful who pray for England’s conver-
sion. It just shows the impossibility of any
accommodation between the Vatican and common
sense. The Archbishop proves that the Pope has
an incalculable stock of works of supererogation
done by the saints of the past, a sort of holy bank
on which he is empowered to draw cheques to any
figure.
At Ararat (Vic.), during the periodical raid
on the Chinese camp, when the usual Celestials’
concubine is seized and charged with drunkenness,
language and vagrancy, and when the usual num-
ber of mean Europeans turn up to swear they are
supporting her, the police-sergeant was questioning
a female witness. “ What’s your name?” “Mrs.
Ah Fat,” she replied. “ Are you quite sure you’re
name is Mrs. Ah Fat?” “Well,” she replied,
tearfully, “T think I deserve it after living with a
man for 20 years.” Even the sergeant was con-
vinced by this unanswerable appeal.
Dear Bulletin, —“ Melb. Pressman ” is
right in his comparison of R.O. and Anglican
clergy. I once sought a Balmain Anglican parson
for press information, and got a four-line para-
graph. Afterwards, he requested me to remain,
and I had visions of soda-water and other horrors,
but resigned myself to my fate. “Do you live
in Balmain ?” he asked. I told him I lived at
Bondi (which was a lie, but near enough). “ Oh,”
he sighed, “you see I am forming a Bible-class
for young men, and thought perhaps you would
join. Er—good afternoon.” Missionising the
heathen pressman 1 That afternoon I attended a
R.O. school festival, and four of us benighted
scribes were afterwards regaled convincingly by
the priests. We agreed to give the R.O.’s half-a-
column.—Thokold D.
A certain Melbourne pawnbroker has lost
all respect for wandering minstrels who blow wind
instruments. His name is Mossy Aarons, and
some time ago a German-Jewish gentleman came
into the shop with a tale of misery terminating in
a pathetic appeal for the loan of a saxhorn from the
stock. Armed with a saxhorn he would, he said,
be able to touch the heart of the people and earn
money. So Mr. Aarons allowed the stranger to
borrow the article, on condition that he should
not blow far away, but look in from time to time
to report progress. Unfortunately, a saxhorn
soloist finds it hard to remain at one spot. By
the time this particular artist had played his third
tune he had received ten successive pennies to go
away, so at last he went away—with the sax-
horn. In due course he got a month’s imprison-
ment for larceny as a bailee ; but what is that to a
pawnbroker’s shattered philanthropy ? .
Jack Denne’s Pupil .
[FOR THE BULLETIN].
Everybody in that Maoriland district knew Jack
Denne. He was married to squatter Nelson’s
only daughter, Cora, and had a billet as sub-
manager on the station.
Djnne had been keeping square for four or five
years, an unusual thing for him.
Old Nelson thought a lot of Jack, and used to
talk about the way be had pulled himself together.
Jack began to tire of the quiet station life, and
frequently took trips to the nearest township, with
the result that latterly he invariably returned
home drunk.
Nelson stood it awhile, but Jack’s trips became
so frequent that he at last told him that if he did
not pull up he would have to leave the station.
Jack thought the old man was only talking, be-
cause if he went he would take hi wife away with
him. Nelson had thought of this, and had got
Cora’s promise that if he sent Jack away, for a
time, she woqld not leave the homestead. They
said to each other that, in a few months’ time, if
Jack squared up, they would take him back.
One night Jack returned home after a two-days’
spree. Nelson packed him off, and as Cora had
been sent away previously for a month’s holiday,
Jack did not see her before he left.
Jack wandered about the country, shearing in
the summer and bush-felling in the winter, and
when work was slack he lived with the Maoris at
the pah at Kororo. Being a good Maori speaker,
he soon took up with a Maori wahine, called
Mutu, the daughter of an old chief.
Jack taught her to English, and when he
was away in the township at nights drinking she
used to amuse herself by learning to read f She
had got hold of some of his letters that he had left
lying about the whare.
He had received one from his wife, Cora, and it
was left lying with the rest. She told him in it
that her father was willing to give him another
chance, and asked him to come home on Christ-
mas Day. Mutu read the letter as well as she
could, and knowing it was not long till Christinas,
she thought Jack might go home to his wife with-
out returning to the pah.
She put on her flax slippers and went down to
the township to bring him home.
Jack always said, when he was drunk, that he
had made a mistake in teaching her English.
A short cut to the pah led right to the face of
a cliff. An arm of the sea ran up a narrow gorge,
where fishermen set their nets, as the schnapper
and kawhai came up through the gorge with the
tide to feed. Straight along this track to within
a few yards of the cliff —then a sharp turn to the
left brought you to Jack’s whare.
Mutu led Jack along. A part of Cora’s letter,
“ Come home on Xmas day,” flashed through her
mind. Would she let him go ? Thinking how the
other Maoris in the pah would talk if he left her,
she led him on.
The fishermen hauled in their nets in the early
morning. They found a few fish, and the bodies
of Jaok and Mutu.
Education is a failure.
HEMI NIRA.
Melb. annually eats 86,000 cattle and
1,200,000 sheep and lambs, yet, according to
T. K. Bennett, a leading meatman, there is in-
spectorial supervision of only one of its abattoirs !
Coroner Youl has a new verdict—“ Satur-
day night suffocation ” of infants by mothers after
their weekly drunk.
Sample of wild humor from S.M. Herald :
Commander M'Giffen had some very narrow escapes
during the Yalu battle. At one time he was directly in
front of the mouth of a 12in. gun on his ship as the
gunner was swinging it into place to fire. He closed his
eyes and waited for certain death. He opened them in a
few seconds and rolled off the superstructure just before
the gun went off.
The man who waited a few seconds under such
conditions would stop to read an article on bi-
metallism while he was running away from a tiger.
Cabled that the agitation re the Shook of
Gampridge's persistent tug on to the British Oom-
mand-in-Ohief has been revived. The idea now
is a Commission to replace him. The spectacle of
such a person as the Duke of Cambridge in
supreme command of an army is not less ludicrous
than would be the appointment of Martin Tupper
as successor to Chancellor Bismarck. Neverthe-
less, if it can be managed, a similar job is to be
re-enacted, as Queen Victoria is bent on giving the
post to her son Connaught, there being a tradi-
tional saying of Prince Albert’s, that the Mon-
archy’will be ruined if the appointment goes out of
the Royal Family.
Is the “person named Rogers” dead yet?
His spirit still inspires that amusing “Colonial
office ” about which Higinbotham said something.
The “Colonial office ” taxes Hongkong and Singa-
pore for the protection of “British trade” in
the East, just as Australia is taxed (voluntarily)
for defence of “ British trade ” here. Trade
follows the flag, and the beastly colonists pay for
the protection of it. The blackmail now levied on
Singapore is £lOO,OOO per annum, and the wretched
place has received notice that after 1896 it will be
£120,000. Newfoundland proposes to submit
itself to the Colonial office —and, as Singapore
shows signs of disputing the bill, perhaps New-
foundland will have to make up the Singapore
deficit as well as its own.
Mr. Eagleson, a Vic. barrister, has just
written a book on “Employers’ Liability,” de-
scribing well that wretched British-born, Yankee-
nurtured principle, used so long and so effectively
by employers to bludgeon maimed employes and
their relatives, and known as the Common
Employment doctrine. The writer shows to
demonstration that the Employers’ Liability Acts
have not so completely extinguished the doctrine
as workmen and their legislators imagine. It
would do Labor-members no harm to read this
part of the book, as fruitful in suggestions of
flaws in the Acts. The Victorian Act is only a
temporary one, and workmen will wake up some
fine morning after a colliery-accident to find their
Act lapsed and themselves thrown on the tender
mercies of the common law. The book is full of
references to N.S.W. cases. The hand of a demo-
crat is visible in the index. The words “ master ”
and “servant’’are relegated to the obscurity of
cross-references, and Higinbotham’s initiative fol-
lowed of “employer” and The
index is a perfect one from every standpoint.
