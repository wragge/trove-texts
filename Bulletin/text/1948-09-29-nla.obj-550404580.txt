ANCIENT BRITONS LIVED IN THE GROTTOES OF WOOKEY HOLE
CjITUATED at the foot of the Mendip Hills in Somerset, two miles from
Wells, these caves are renowned, not only for the size and beauty of the
grottoes, but also for the history and legend attached to them.
Over two thousand years ago these caves were occupied by the Ancient
Britons for an unbroken period of seven hundred years—2so b.c. to 450 a.d.
—and excavations have given a very close insight into their mode of living.
Pottery, bone pins, weaving combs, corn-grinding querns, implements of
antler and iron have been found, and by the number of Roman coins it is
apparent that they traded with the Romans during their occupation of Britain.
Further excavations in what is known as the Hyaena Den have revealed
the existence, 40,000 to 60,000 years ,ago, of animals which are now extinct
or not now living in England, such as hyaena, rhinoceros, cave-lion, reindeer,
wolf, urns, bison, elephant and mammoth.
In 1912 the discovery, at a depth of twelve feet under the debris, of the
skeleton of a woman, together with the skulls of two goat kids, a milking-pot,
sacrificial knife, dagger and a stalagmite ball like a crystal, corroborates the
legend of the “Witch of Wookey.”
The legend of the Witch of Wookey, the evil woman who was turned
into stone for her sins by a monk from Glastonbury, is evidently based on
fact, for her effigy can be seen here brooding beside the silent waters of the
subterranean river Axe, which over many centuries hollowed out the great
chambers and submerged passages.
Explorations by divers in 1946 recovered skulls and other relics of late-
Celtic origin, which are considered by authorities to be victims of sacrifices
some 2000 years ago. These discoveries, together with a representative
collection of Celtic and Romano-British relics from the floor of the entrance
passage, are housed in the museum at Wookey Hole.
The variegated coloring, the fantastic shapes of the stalactite formations,
the enormous size of the floodlit caverns in this amazing underworld, all
contribute to make Wookey Hole one of Somerset’s leading attractions.

AUTHORS ON CENSORSHIP.
[“We know no spectacle so ridicu-
lous,” said Macaulay, discussing Byron,
“as the British public in one of its
periodical fits of morality”:
In general, elopements, divorces, and
family quarrels, pass with little notice. We
read the scandal, talk about it for a
day, and forget it. But once in six
or seven years our virtue becomes out-
rageous. We cannot puffer the laws
of religion and decency to be violated.
We must make a stand against vice. We
must teach libertines that the English
people appreciate the importance of
domestic ties. Accordingly some unfortu-
nate man, in no respect more depraved
than hundreds whose offences have been
treated with lenity, is singled out as an
expiatory sacrifice. If he has children, they
are to be taken from him. If he has a
profession, he is to be driven from it. He
is cut by the higher orders, and hissed by
the lower. He is, in truth, a sort of whip-
ping-boy, by whose vicarious agonies all
other transgressors of the same class are,
it is supposed, sufficiently chastised. We
reflect very complacently on our own
severity, and compare with great pride the
high standard of morals established in
England with the Parisian laxity. At length
our anger is satiated. Our victim is mined
and heartbroken. And our virtue goes
quietly to sleep for seven years more.
To protect from such fits of morality
dead authors and those who, living over-
seas, cannot be committed to an Aus-
tralian jail, but may still be banned by the
clerks of the Customs Department, the
Federal Government of 1937 established
the Literature Censorship Board. The
Red Page (B. 4/8/’4B) has suggested that,
before a living Australian author is
dragged into court, this, or a similar
body, should be consulted and should pre-
pare a report which, in the event of a
prosecution, could be accepted by the
Court as “expert evidence.” Comments
on this plan from a representative group
of authors, critics and publishers are
printed below. Further comments will
appear on next week’s Red Page.]
From F. Bell, City Librarian, Sydney
Municipal Library : —
Admitting the necessity of some form
of literary censorship in Australia, *the
question is: How effective is our present
system? So far as the Federal censor-
ship of imported literature is concerned,
the present system does not hamper the
public librarian in his choice of overseas
publications. Before an American or an
English book is chosen for purchase by a
library it must pass certain tests, and it
is very rare indeed to find that such a
book has incurred the displeasure of the
censorship authorities.
Regarding Australian literature, it is
obvious that the present methods of
determining whether a book is harmful or
not are quite unsatisfactory. Let the
States retain their right to prosecute an
erring author or publisher, but only after
the book has been subject to examination
and report by a competent censorship
board. This would best be effected by
extending the present membership of the
Commonwealth Literature Censorship
Board to include representatives of the
States, by extending its powers to censor
over all literature either imported into, or
published in, Australia and by divorcing
it from the Customs Department.
From G. A. Ferguson, of Angus and
Robertson, Ltd. : —
The recent cases of We Were the Rats
and Love Me, Sailor revealed the muddle
of censorship in Australia today ; so that
your Red Page article is timely and con-
structive.
From the publisher’s point of view it
is not so much a matter of arguing the
principle of censorship as of realising
that in Australia there will be censorship
at some point. What matters to pub-
lisher and author is—where is this point,
by what standards is it to be arrived at,
and by whom?
Publishers would welcome the oppor-
tunity to submit doubtful MSS. to an
appropriate panel for an opinion. If
there were subsequent legal argument this
opinion could be used as evidence.
Perhaps the Advisory Board of the
Commonwealth Literary Fund could be
used as this panel,
* * * *
From E. C. Harris, managing-director
of Georgian House : —
. Censorship of books coming into Aus-
tralia from other English-speaking
countries is a piece of wowseristic super-
fluity. What is good enough for English
and American readers ought to be good
enough for us. Anyhow, what is banned
in 1948 will probably be admitted in
1968 ; even censors change their minds,
witness Joyce’s Ulysses, banned until
1948, now prescribed as a textbook in
Melbourne University.
Censorship of books published in Aus-
tralia by police and law courts is utterly
futile. It destroys freedom, promotes
fear and stimulates unhealthy interest in
the book censored, therefore nullifying
any advantage it may have for those who
may want to suppress views with which
they do not agree.
Publishers and authors have as great a
sense of responsibility as Judges, and a
far greater sense than juries, which fre-
quently make decisions contrary to justice
and commonsense, so that they may the
sooner be done with their unsought and
unwanted task.
From Professor Walter Murdoch : —
The position at present is that adult
Australian citizens, presumably sane, are
told what they may and what they must
on no account read by a mysterious body
pledged to give us no reasons for its
decision. This secret tribunal acts as the
bodyguard of Mrs. Grundy, a funda-
mentally absurd lady, the fertile mother
of a huge progeny of absurdities, I am
ready to join forces with anybody who
will take arms against our present crazy
system of censorship, which is entirely
unworthy of a civilised nation.
From C. E. W. Bean : —
I agree almost wholly with your sug-
gestions for censorship—“almost,” be-
cause I feel that there are two necessary
conditions: (1) That Government always
appoints its Board and Appeal Censor as
wisely as in the present selection; and
. (2) that provision is made for dealing
promptly with books that are held up.
I am afraid that these conditions are
not likely to be fulfilled without much
insistence and vigilance.
From Robert D. Fitz Gerald :
There can be little doubt that the sug-
gested improvement in the machinery of
censorship would give greater stability.
Authors and publishers would know
that if a prosecution were mooted it
would either be withdrawn on the report
of the expert and enlightened committee
(whose names would be known and
whose views could very likely be pre-
dicted and to whom MSS. might volun-
tarily be submitted by publishers) or that
if launched the principal evidence at the
trial would be the report itself. The
reasonableness of a jury and the im-
partiality of a judge in dealing with such
direct evidence can still safely be
assumed; what cannot at present be
assumed or assessed are the individual
views a judge or jurymen may have, not
on evidence but on particular taboos.
Uncertainty would remain as to what
might or might not be printed without
infringing the law. Remain it should;
for it is not an author’s duty as an
author, though it is as a citizen, to keep
within laws, but to awaken conscious-
ness. That awakened consciousness' is
the basis of order —of which laws are
simply the expression. Moreover, uncer-
tainty could only be removed by exact
legislation setting out in detail what sub-
jects, indeed what words, may or may
not go through a printing press. Such
legislation, setting censorship rigidly in
concrete, would not be in the interest of
authors. All this accepts the premise—
the “debatable point”—that a censorship
must be maintained at all.
Both censorship and the defence
against it that such-and-such work is
“literature” make the fundamental mis-
take of supposing that a line of demar-
cation can be drawn by a set of rules
between literature and pornography. The
fact is that by the curiously unmoral
standards of censorship* literature can
quite readily be pornographic, and
pornography is quite frequently literature.
To distinguish what elevates and awakens
consciousness by beauty and sincerity
from what debases the mind by crudity
or hatred of human efforts and desires
requires a rather higher morality than
can be imposed by a police force
whether armed with batons or prayer-
books.
A creative artist may assent to censor-
ship, whether self-imposed or imposed by
law, as a temporary concession to the
moral standards of his personal environ-
ment ; but in his capacity as artist he
must fight continuously for a raising of
those standards if his work is to have
more real significance than a pretty
hobby well or badly paid. Uncertainties
of censorship, irritating and bewildering
as they are, have, therefore, the advan-
tages as well as the annoyances of their
elasticity. Occasionally—if unpredictably
—they allow a little extra elbow-room in
the workshop. For this reason, too, the
vagaries of our indirect censorship of
local publications by prosecution are
probably preferable to direct, arbitrary
and rigid supervision of publications by
some as yet unconstituted Department of
Censorship. There is much savagery in
the process, however. Some such pro-
cedure as that recommended by The
Bulletin might civilise it.
* * * *
From Professor W. A. Osborne : —
I heartily support the attitude of the
Red Page. It will be a long time before
Australia lives down the banning of
Redheap and the manacling of Robert
Close. Censorship will always be diffi-
cult on account of indefinite and changing
standards of decency and the impossi-
bility of pleasing extremists in opposing
camps, but I fear it is necessary, as other-
wise publishers and writers of non-British
stock would flood the country with com-
mercialised filth. I would recommend
the formation of a single Federal Board
of Censors dealing both with imported
and locally published material, composed
of men of wide experience in literature
and life, exempt from political and
ecclesiastical pressure and possessing true
executive powers—not like the Common-
wealth Literary Fund Advisory Board,
which can merely recommend, the final
decision being left to an inexpert com-
mittee of politicians. We might well
adopt an unwritten rule operating in
England which, like so many British pro-
cedures, may not be very logical but is
eminently practical, and that is to give
expensive books a wide latitude of ex-
pression—indeed, with highly-priced
works censoring is unnecessary.
From Miles Franklin :
The Red Page article on censorship
draws attention to a state of affairs
dangerous to that freedom of expression
vital to democracies worth the name.
Putting aside for the moment the basic
debate on whether censorship should be
abolished, it is imperative, in the interests
of literature, whether imported or pro-
duced here, that the operations of any
censorship (even by a board including
men of such erudition and understanding
of literature as those at present acting
for us), should be readily available to all
those specifically concerned with books
such as writers, publishers, teachers,
librarians and those who use libraries.
The titles of books banned and the rea-
sons for such prohibition must be made
public. The suggestion of a similar
board to deal with Australian books
arouses suspicion in this overburdened
taxpayer as a second mustard-plaster on
a helpless sufferer when the extension of
the first would be equally effective or in-
effective.
From Vance Palmer : —
I don’t think that the creation of an-
other censorship board, no matter how
it was constituted, would make the writer
feel more secure. On the whole, his
freedom depends on the gradual liberalis-
ing of public opinion. If it were accepted
in all Acts relating to obscene or indecent
publication that honest intention and
literary quality were valid arguments for
the defence, there would be little reason
to complain. The scandal of a recent
prosecution was that it was carried out
under apt old Act that did not admit such
a defence. In general, police prosecution
is preferable to censorship of any kind.
Individual authors are likely to suffer
from it, at one time or another, but if
injustice is done it is done in open day-
light, and the public knowledge of what
literature is all about is increased by the
attention given to a literary prosecution.
On the whole, we have had few such
prosecutions. The sort of cross-examina-
tion an intelligent barrister can give to
illiterate witnesses, when matters of
literary knowledge or judgment are con-
cerned, acts as a restraint on both police-
officials and Governments.
From H. M. Green :
The whole business of censorship out
here is a disgrace to Australia; The
Bulletin is doing good work in exposing
it, and I wholeheartedly support its pro-
posals. The fact that so much is kept
secret about the whole business is damn-
ing enough in itself, apart from such of
the results as we are allowed to hear
about. As to the banning of imported
books, since the Government has estab-
lished a board it should leave that en-
tirely to them. It is most important to
settle this first, and then, as The Bulletin
suggests, a similar board might well be
set up to deal with locally-printed books,
of which accepted manuscripts might be
submitted in advance ; or the one board
might undertake the whole business. A
somewhat similar suggestion was made
in an article of mine on the Red Page
as long ago as 20/2/’35. Two things are
above all necessary: (1) The publication
and sale of no book should be interfered
with except on the decision of an educated
and well-read person that it possesses no
literary value, or practically none; and
(2) everything should be open and above-
board, and full information available to
everybody.
From Norman Lindsay :
The one rational solution of appoint-
ing a board of cultured men to adjudi-
cate on questionable printed matter is so
obvious that one can hardly expect it to
be adopted by a country as incurably
wrongheaded on cultural matters as
Australia,
While any prowling creature of the
wowser species is permitted anonymously
to institute police proceedings against a
book, and while the Customs operates
as a secret tribunal with arbitrary powers
to ban what it pleases, we are consigned
to a medieval limbo, as was clearly
shown by the penalties imposed on the
publisher and author of that essentially
wowseristic tract Love Me, Sailor.
There can be no greater farce perpe-
trated in the name of justice than allow-
ing 12 average citizens to give a verdict
on any passage claimed to be indecent.
The result is a foregone conclusion by
the mere presumption of indecency.
There is hardly a world classic that
would not be condemned on such terms.
Or, perhaps, one thing is rtiore
farcical: a Judge solemnly accepting the
assurance of a member of the Vice
Squad that his refinement has been
shocked by a page of printed matter.
The writers of this country must re-
luctantly face the unpalatable fact that
they can expect no help from the law in
their efforts to stabilise its culture. One
cannot accept the understanding that the
Judges really endorse the verdicts they
give against certain novels banned in this
country. They are men who have had a
university education. Their profession
gives them an intimate knowledge of
human motives and personality. They
know, as any well-balanced man must,
that ijo book ever printed has had the
slightest demoralising effect on morals.
Yet they take cover behind the letter of
an obsolete law when it is the question of
stating that simple truth from the Bench.
It is a strange thing that they cannot see
that the dignity of the law is as much in-
volved as the dignity of letters in the
need to defend literature from the type
of mentality that always has, and always
will, attack it.
I believe that the Judges of this country
administer its general law well and in-
corruptibly, but where any issue touches
an accusation of indecency we can sigh
in vain for a Mr. Justice McCardie on
the Australian Bench.
From Myra Morris : —
The Red Page, in opening up the sub-
ject of Australian censorship (a subject
that concerns not only the bewildered
writer but all those who care for the
future of Australian writing), has dealt
usefully with i a matter of great import-
ance. For it is, beyond doubt, a matter
of importance that an author of a
literary work may, under the present sys-
tem of censorship, find himself going to
jail.
The Red Page’s suggestion of a compe-
tent board to deal with the censorship
of books published in Australia has
everything to commend it* Such a board
(functioning visibly) would offer the
writer the protection that he needs and
do something towards lessening that very
real, very damaging fear, the fear of
obscenity which (to quote a present-day
writer) “must cause sometimes a sub-
conscious and fundamental castration of
thought and feeling which is much more
dangerous than the elisions of a pub-
lisher’s pencil, and may well be respon-
sible for the spinster fancies that are so
enormously saleable.”
From Professor E. Morris Miller: —
Assuming that the censorship of books
(undesirable as it is) continues as a Gov-
ernment policy, I agree generally with
The Bulletin’s suggestion that the
C.L.C. Board’s powers be extended. The
proposal allows; for an advance from the
tangible authority of mere legality to the
intangible authority of morality—a bal-
ancing between the autonomy of the in-
dividual and the autonomy of the State.
The main problem of the board would
be to determine in each case the limits
of a writer’s subjection to the com-
munity. The proposed board would act
as an umpire between the standards of
the group to which the writer in particu-
lar belongs and those of the community
as a whole. Its decisions would indicate
appropriate moral checks and balances
as between small and large groups in the
same society. In this service there is
no place for secrecy. The rules and de-
terminations of the censorship authority,
whether the board or the Minister, should
be at all times available for public criti-
cism. The board itself should not be
narrowly constituted. Its members, how-
ever estimable otherwise, should not re-
side in the same neighborhood; they
should be dissimilar in professional or
other attitudes and, as far as possible,
unaffected by the subtle influences of any
bias, whether academic, political, ecclesi-
astical, literary or moral.

Meaning of “yellow journalism”
and how did the term originate?
It is the name given to the sensa-
tional journalism of America, which
developed about 1880. The term is
derived from the appearance in 1895
of a number of the New York
“World” in which a child in a yellow
dress (“The Yellow Kid”) was the
central figure of the cartoon, this
being an experiment in color-printing
designed to attract purchasers.

How did the phrase “to grin like
a Cheshire cat” originate?
No satisfactory explanation of the
allusion has been put forward. It
has been attributed to the fact that
Cheshire cheeses were at one time
moulded in the shape of a cat; and to
the attempt of a sign-painter to repre-
sent a lion rampant on the signs of
many of the Cheshire inns.

Preventive measures against white-
ants when building?
All stumps, roots and timber should
be removed from the soil in the
vicinity of the proposed structure, as
frequently these are sources of infes-
tation. The flooring should be raised
well off the ground on concrete or
brick foundations, so that no timber
is in direct contact with the soil.
There should be good ventilation and
sufficient room to carry out an in-
spection of the flooring from under-
neath. Treat all timber, as far as prac-
ticable, by painting or soaking in creo-
sote oil. Where timber has to be
placed in or on the ground it should
be treated with creosote oil and the
ground around it also saturated with
the oil. Additional treatments given
every three to five years will extend
the period of immunity to attack.
The piers supporting the flooring
should be capped with flat zinc-com-
position plate, iin. thick, projecting
two or three inches, and cut with
a square edge, but the ordinary gal-
vanised-iron capping can be recom-
mended.

Who was Joanna Southcott?
A religious fanatic born in 1750,
she was a Devonshire farmer’s
daughter, who was for many years in
domestic service. In 1792 she began
to write doggerel prophecies and to
claim supernatural gifts, and in time
attracted a very large number of fol-
lowers. In 1802 she affirmed that she
would be delivered of a spiritual
being, called Shiloh. She died in 1814
of brain disease, leaving a sealed box
with directions that it should be
opened at a time of national crisis in
the presence of the assembled bishops.
It was opened in 1927, one bishop
being present, and was found to con-
tain nothing of interest.

Is there an antidote for the heavy
losses every year in antirrhinum and
stock plants?
To combat fungus disease which
attacks the roots of these plants, dig
out all affected plants as soon as they
begin to wither and burn them.
Drench the area with strong perman-
ganate of potash or lime-sulphur
solution, and before replanting dig
lime thoroughly through the soil.
Neither of these plants should be
grown in the same area for at least
a year.

H.G.8.; (1) The outer casing of the
binoculars might be painted with an
air-drying black enamel, after scraping
off the old khaki paint. (2) The best
finish is a stoved black, done before
the lenses are assembled and only by
experts. (3) The cases are usually
treated with raven oil, but it must be
very thoroughly dried and rubbed with
a cloth. A coating of clear lacquer
might stop the black from marking
the clothes of the user D.C.McW.:

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
U.S. Presidency.
At one stage of his tour of the
southern States with Henry Wal-
lace the N. Y. “Times” man
was able to report with a little
relief: “There was a lot of
heckling but not many eggs.”
Elsewhere it had been “eggs,
tomatoes and ice-cream cones,”
which Henry was reckoned to
have asked for by declaiming “I
believe negroes should have the
right to vote.”
But, though the googs and
assorted produce heaved at
Henry are an accurate enough
indication of his Presidential
chances, he is still generally con-
sidered certain to drain away
enough votes normally belonging
to his old party to oust Truman
from the Presidency. “Whatever
the number of votes Mr. Wal-
lace may receive,” comments a
“Herald Tribune” writer, “prac-
tically all will be a subtraction
from Mr. Truman—it is difficult
to imagine anyone voting for
Mr. Wallace who otherwise
would have voted for Mr.
Dewey.”
Wallace’s drawing strength is
put at 5,000,000 votes or more
—enough to have defeated
Roosevelt in 1944. Moreover,
a large part of that vote is ex-
pected to be in New York City,
further lessening the Truman
chance of carrying New York
State ; and only once in 50 years
has a party lost that State and
carried the country.
Thus, it is as good as un-
animously expected that Wal-
lace, who was sacked by Truman,
will succeed in pulling Truman
down in the election now only
a month ahead. At the same
time Henry will have such satis-
faction as he may find in being
the wrecker of his old party.
Perhaps a consideration with
him is that a Republican Presi-
dent may still be influenced by
the isolationism which, till re-
cently, was the most positive
Republican characteristic. That
would accord with Wallace’s
crusading for a softer approach
to Stalin, Henry believing the
sun rises when Joe gets out of
bed. He is, however, likely to
be disappointed in that expecta-
tion, since the stand against
Soviet expansion and aggression
is not the preserve of the Tru-
manites, but fixed U.S. policy.
As well as Henry, the Truman
forces have to contend with what
are called the Dixiecrats, a
mushroom States’ Rights party
in the usually loyally Democratic
South. The Dixiecrats object
to Truman civil-rights proposals,
interpreted as leading to equality
for negroes. They may not take
any State from Truman in the
South itself, but are expected to
act against him in the doubtful
border States, where the same
objections are shared. As well,
the Democratic party itself is
represented as divided; and on
all these grounds the sum of
opinion is that the election cam-
paigning has not altered Tru-
man’s very shaky prospects, de-
spite his having the assurance of
solid backing by labor. Per-
haps the actual strongest force
operating against him is the de-
sire for change, the force which,
in its due course, decides in all
democracies, and which alone
safeguards them as democracies.
Holding Berlin.
Various views have been
quoted here supporting sugges-
tions that Berlin is not worth
hanging on to, let alone fighting
for. In N. Y. “Herald Tribune”
Walter Lippmann supports the
rightness of the other view.
Holding that “it is impossible
to exaggerate the importance of
Berlin in the future of Germany
and of Europe,” Lippmann con-
tends that to withdraw, to con-
cede that Berlin might be the
capital of a German State under
the control of Russia alone,
would lead to the loss of the
whole of Germany.
A “capital” on the Western
side, set up at Frankfurt, would
merely be in German eyes the
symbol of the partition and of
the defeat and destruction of
Germany as a great Power: “As
between Frankfurt and Berlin
the ultimate allegiance of all
nationalist Germans must be to
Berlin.” The obvious policy for
any Frankfurt Government
would be to end the partition
and restore the unity of Ger-
many ; and “In pursuit of this
objective, the Russians, with their
German Government in Berlin,
will hold far stronger cards than
we can hold with our Govern-
ment in Frankfurt.”
The outcome; “Once we had
left Berlin, and had recognised
it as a German capital, and
given the western Germans a
Government, our own German
State with its capital at Frank-
furt would take over the prob-
lem, which we had been unable
to solve, of negotiating a general
settlement with Russia. We
should have surrendered Berlin
to the Russians and Frankfurt
to the Germans, and after that
the German peace treaty would
become a matter to be worked
out secretly by the Germans and
the Russians.”
French Shuffling.
Whether or not France ever
can recover its old place—torn
and broken and wrecked as it
has been—it is not likely to get
far along that hard road until
general elections set up a Gov-
ernment with the strength to
govern: “Which,” say the De
Gaullists, “means us.”
How far France now is from
a truly representative National
Assembly is shown by compari-
sons in a Scripps-Howard re-
port: “The municipal elections
last October gave Gen, Charles
de Gaulle’s party nearly 40 per
cent, of the popular vote. The
Communists won about 30 per
cent. That would leave 30 per
cent, for all the other groups.
Yet in the present Assembly the
Communists hold 186 seats, the
M.R.P. (Popular Republicans)
165, Socialists 103, parties of the
centre 70, with a scattering of
seats by smaller parties. The
De Gaullists are not repre-
sented at all.”
With that as the set-up, shuf-
fling Cabinets is not much of a
solution for France. “It has be-
come axiomatic,” comments
Scripps-Howard foreign editor
William Philip Simms, “that
France must either resume the
leadership of Europe or go into
eclipse herself. And the corol-
lary of this is that without
France there can be no vigorous
Europe.”
As for De Gaulle, the same
writer quotes private advices
from France as indicating that
many Frenchmen still think the
General hard to get on with, but
few now think he would try to
be a dictator: “Few fear him
as a potential ‘man on horse-
back.’ They think the spirit of
liberty, equality and fraternity
is still strong enough, and French
commonsense plentiful enough,
to make him keep his feet on
the ground. Especially in a
coalition Government.”
The most important thing
directly at stake is, of course,
the Marshall Plan, and all that
that means. N. Y. “Times”
Paris correspondent Harold Cal-
lender would have his own sur-
roundings first in mind in com-
menting on “the economic co-
operation imposed by the Mar-
shall Plan dollars” having been
“delayed and threatened by
national divergence.”
That means, above all, French
divergence (or disintegration);
and significantly it was the con-
servative “Le Monde” which
lately commented: “Enslave-
ment by the Russian police State
or by the capitalist American
system —here is the real danger
for Europe.” The reference to
America and the Marshall Plan
in that would be endorsed by
any Parisian Communist sheet
and by the Kremlin, from where
exactly that line of propaganda
against the whole Plan eman-
ated.
“Le Monde’s” article allowed
that the United States “menace”
w r as less dangerous than the
Russian, but it insisted that both
existed and both threatened the
“European spirit.” Such feel-
ing against the Plan would only
have to be proved as generally
French as this would seem to
suggest and certainly no Repub-
lican-led America would favor
continuing aid so despised.
Europe’s Unity Lags.
In line with the discouraging
reports on France, reports on
Europe generally which are
reaching the U.S. press from
correspondents are hardly cal-
culated to keep enthusiasm alive
for endless aid to the Mad Con-
tinent —particularly as that aid
is already blamed for high prices
and any shortages that occur in
the U.S.
The reports discount optimistic
views on Europe; show very
slow progress being made in its
countries’ co-operation among
themselves and similar require-
ments of the Marshall Plan.
Thus a correspondent of N. Y.
“Times” reports that “the move
for a union of Western Europe
goes forward at a snail’s pace,
although it is stimulated by what
is considered a danger to peace.”
One hindrance, noted particu-
larly in France, is fear that the
purpose of unity under the Mar-
shall Plan is to further the
strategic interests of the United
States; a view which, as far as
it exists, shows that Kremlin
propaganda has been effective.
The Swiss and Swedes are men-
tioned as holding back because
they find the Marshall Plan too
closely associated with the
frankly strategic Western Union
pact of Britain, France and the
Benelux countries, also behind
their view being “a lingering
attachment to neutrality and a
belief that neutrality is perhaps
not so obsolete as the last two
wars seemed to prove.”
The project for a Western
German State to co-operate
under the Marshall Plan is an-
other snag, chiefly because of
French fears and suspicions.
Britain, for its part, is also
shown in these reports as not
being as willing as expected or
promised: “While keenly in-
terested in the strategic aspects
of Western European unity,
Britain is less ready to join in
this unity in the economic or
political sphere because of her
world markets and her ties with
the Dominions.”
That last is sure to be a major
issue at the meeting of Britain
and Dominions in London a
week or so hence. Whatever
co-operation regarding Europe
that meeting may bring about,
the fact appears to be that the
European-co-operation plan is
dragging, and disappointment is
being expressed in America.
Jerusalem Bid.
Sir Ronald Storrs, author of
Orientations and expert on the
Middle East, comments in a
London “Times” letter that “One
of the by-products of extreme
Zionism is that anybody—what-
ever his previous pro-Jewish
record—who reminds the world
of the British achievement in
Palestine is liable to be pilloried
as an anti-Semite.”
A far worse “by-product” has
been the murder of U.N.O.
mediator Count Bernadotte —a
direct outcome of the extreme-
Zionist bid to have Jerusalem
included in the State of Israel.
An outcome, also, of the open
incitement in'America of exactly
the same sort of vicious murder-
ing, with hardly a word of
official U.S. condemnation
while Britain had the Palestine
mandate job.
In America during the past
three years the Irgun and Stern
murder-crews have figured as
heroes in a foul campaign of
hate-Britain propaganda. This
has not only appeared in adver-
tisement form in leading Ameri-
can papers, but has had editorial
support in some of them and
condemnation in practically
none.
Meanwhile, as Mr. Bevin was
impelled to state openly at the
time, action by an American
President—Mr. Truman’s vote-
catching declaration for the im-
mediate entry into Palestine of
100,000 Jewish immigrants—
broke a settlement the British
Foreign Minister had all but
arranged between Arabs and
Jews. Meanwhile, too, there
has been the State-recognition
of Israel in the same interested
U.S. quarter. Funds have been
openly solicited and collected in
the U.S. to support and supply
the murder-crews. America cer-
tainly should be shocked over
the Bernadotte murder.
Shortly before that murder a
Mr. Ivan M. Greenberg in-
formed the world through Lon-
don “Times” that Mr. Mena-
chem Beigin, the “distinguished
commander-in-chief of Irgun,”
with whom he had “just been
privileged to hold long and in-
structive conversations,” would
“fight to the last man” until the
Government proclaimed Jeru-
salem “part of the inalienable
territory of Israel.”
On that revealing bit of in-
formation, Sir Ronald Storrs
acidly commented: “I know not
whether Mr. Greenberg is a
British subject. If he is, he
would seem to have returned
from Palestine strangely unaware
of the long Stern and Irgun list
of cold-blooded murders of un-
offending British soldiers, police-
men and civilians, culminating
in the hanging-up and slow
strangling of two British ser-
geants, ahd the turning of their
bodies into explosive booby-
traps for their comrades who
came to cut them down. Is it
to the tender mercies of the yet
unapproved Government which
has tolerated, condoned, sup-
ported and profited by such
deeds that the world conscience
is now ordered to consign the
cradle of Christianity?”
Whatever U.N.O. now decides
for the future of Palestine in
general and Jerusalem in par-
ticular, the U.S. would seem to
have earned the onus of taking
the biggest share of the burden.
Dominion Needs.
Referring to the proposed
spreading of Britain’s man-
power and other strength
around the rest of the British
Commonwealth the strategic
concept which has strong advo-
cates, particularly among mili-
tary authorities —Yale Associate
Professor of International Rela-
tions Bernard Brodie makes the
following comments in the
course of a thoughtful article in
“Foreign Affairs”:
“The English - speaking
Dominions would like an influx
of capital which would enable
them to industrialise further and
thereby presumably raise both
their standards of living and the
size of their populations. And
in so far as they want immi-
grants: at all, they clearly prefer
Britons. But they do not wish
a great influx of immigrants
without a corresponding inflow
of capital.
“The United Kingdom cer-
tainly does not have the capital
to provide. Nor can she raise
it simply by disinvestment at
home. The industries of Britain
represent, among other things, a
good deal of fixed and sunk
capital not subject to removal.
To be sure, specific industries of
strategic importance —like the
aircraft-building industry, which
seems nowhere to be com-
mercially self-supporting, any-
way—can be helped to develop
in the Dominions by some mea-
sure of disinvestment at home,
but the possibilities in that
direction are very limited. While
hard times at home may induce
some Englishmen to leave, the
chances are small indeed that
any considerable number of
them can be induced to move in
peace-time because of some
soldiers’ strategic calculations.
“However, it is important to
remember [regarding Imperial
cohesion] that the attraction for
security which the United King-
dom has so largely lost is now
exerted by the United States.
And since the Dominions would
otherwise prefer their co-equal
partnership with the United
Kingdom, with whom they share
great traditions and sentiments,
to dependency upon the all top
self-sufficient United States, it
lies within our [U.S.] power to
harmonise those conflicting
attractions. Should American
policy show itself consistently
friendly to British interests and
to the Commonwealth system,
the Imperial connection will take
on new and added meaning to
the Dominions. All that is re-
quired is that Americans should
realise what a marvellous and
rare invention the British Com-
monwealth of Nations is, how
much good it has! done in the
world and how much it is to our
interest that it should survive.”

of the fluid flow to Tito from Trieste;
“and there are reasons to believe that
if his economic thirst becomes acute
it may again be quenched from the
same source.”

Kidnappings Unlimited. The
attempts to kidnap scared Russians in
the U.S. and ship them home for
whatever mercy awaited them there
caused a first-class sensation in
America, but it was actually normal
Soviet behavior. Back in the U.S.
from Central Europe, N. Y. “Herald
Tribune” correspondent Seymour
Freidin reports that in Vienna, for
example, there has been an average
of one kidnapping a day for more
than a year. Moreover, “Plunges
from windows followed a startling
percentage of the abductions.” Mai\y
of these jumps, falls or pushes oc-
curred after the victim had been in
custody for several days, such cases
happening “with dreary frequency in
the easternmost satellites.”

Policies on Germany. —The whale
of a difference between Soviet and
West ideas for Germany, as summed-
up by Scripps-Howard foreign editor
William Philip Simms: “There is
nothing to warrant the belief that the
Kremlin has changed its policy one
iota. That policy is to create a
‘united’ Germany, which at a signal
could be transformed, as Czecho-
slovakia was transformed, into a
Soviet satellite. The three Western
Allies want a united Germany, too.
But they want it to be free, self-
governing, self-supporting, democratic
and incapable of making war even if
it wanted to.”
* * * ♦
Petrol Cuts. —With the latest cuts in
petrol, a brief item from London
“Daily Mail” will no doubt have an
Australian application: “To win the
war in 1945 Ministers’ cars used 250
gallons. In 1947 the battle for peace
demanded the consumption of 1250
gallons.” On this item Chicago
“Tribune” commented: “The rising
tide of Government fuel consumption
reached its peak during the very
period when Labor-party fuel-ration-
ing was driving one out of every three
motorists off the road.”
* * * *
Fifth-column Service. —From the
distant quarter of Sweden’s defence
line up near the Arctic Circle a
correspondent of N. Y. “Times”
quotes “a recurring comment” made
to him by Swedes: “We have been
able to keep the military secrets of
this highly important defence area
from foreigners fairly well, but we
have been powerless to prevent
Swedish Communists from doing the
snooping.” And, of course, there’s
no need to go so far as the Arctic.
V * * *
Russian Wives. —In all matters
Russian it’s as well to allow some
margin for the differences in actual
thinking processes between the Occi-
dental and the Asiatic. E.g., the
reason given by the Soviet representa-
tive in U.N.O. for the refusals to
allow Russian wives of other nationals
to leave Russia: “Foreigners send
their nationals in to recruit agents,
especially from among our women.
This is the core of the matter.” It
could be the Asian-Russian mentality
to believe that that really explains the
marriages.
* * * *
Freedom, Justice, then Peace. —In
a speech in Paris, reported by London
“Times,” Field-Marshal Lord Mont-
gomery declared that the ultimate ob-
ject must be “freedom, justice and
peace, in that order.” He added:
“Some people put peace first, but
that cannot be right.” Peace was not
a direct aim but a by-product, and
too much concentration on it meant
appeasement. “A nation that is reso-
lute and clear-headed and is brave
enough to protect freedom and justice
without regard to risks is more likely
to get peace than by appeasement and
passivity.”
* * * *
Soviet Biology. —For the informa-
tion of Corns and fellow-travellers
who may not have caught up with
the party-line in this respect,
heredity is out as “the basic force in
nature”; that stuff, by ukase of the
Communist Central Committee in
Moscow (reported from there by a
correspondent of N. Y. “Herald
Tribune”), is mere “alien foreign
bourgeois biology.”- The “important
factor” is environment —as in, say,
the Australian-Russian Society.

BERT IN THE BEANSTALK.
Dr. Evatt’s press-boys on the other side
of the world have no light task in front
of them, Canberra’s Ijmelighter No. 1
demands a formidable build-up this time
with his current programme, to wit:
The Bank Grab Act appeal case before
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,
of which Dr. Evatt is by right a member,
though he will now appear before it as his
Government’s advocate.
The Empire Prime Ministers’ Conference
within a week’s time, where he will depu-
tise for Mr. Chifley with no more “pangs
and inhibitions” about the need for work-
ing with Britain than he and his late war-
time chief once expressed for consulting
apart from her.
The Paris meeting of U.N.0., now in full
swing, where Dr. Evatt has at last succeeded
in getting himself elected president of the
General Assembly,
Nothing less than an entire hotel is
likely to be adequate for the accommoda-
tion of his staff, which will include:
The Government’s master-planner of the
“Golden Age,” Dr. Coombs.
Professor Bailey, Solicitor-General.
The Commonwealth Statistician.
The assistant-secretaries from the Treasury
and the Commerce Department in Canberra.
The London High Commissioner (wait-
ing to be made “Ambassador” there).
The Australian Ambassadors from" Paris
and Moscow and the Government repre-
sentative from New York.
Mr. Shaw, from the Allied Control Coun-
cil in Japan.
Two Bishops specially appointed from
Australia (one Protestant and one Roman
Catholic).
Representatives of the Navy, Army and
Air Force.
Alternate delegates and advisers from De-
partment of External Affairs, also legal
advisers.
And their staffs, secretaries, chauffeurs,
and (if the London High Commissioner’s
set-up is any criterion) their special food
commissariat.
What a political Olympic Games to
write home about!
Before the result of the presidency-
ballot was known there was some anxiety
in the Evatt camp. American response
to the pro-Evatt canvassing had been
tepid “because of Australia’s unpre-
dictable attitude at former U.N.O. meet-
ings when her representatives frequently
supported Russian views”—a reference to
Our Foreign Policy’s famous “changes of
plumage in mid-flight.” However, the
press-boys will now be able to concen-
trate dutifully upon the other Evatt aim:
they have already flown a second kite
and reported that “Turkey has nominated
him for one of the five vacancies on the
bench of the International Court of
Justice,” which the knowing ones have
been saying for some time is Dr. Evatt’s
hope of escape from the sinking Socialist
ship in Canberra. For if he gets that job
he will be allowed to engage in nothing
else.
It clears the air that Dr, Evatt has at
last confirmed rumors of his oversea
ambitions. Tq be Minister for External
Affairs in Australia has become small
potatoes; the gibe of Czechoslovakia’s
murdered Jan Masaryk seems to have
sunk in—that it was the softest job he
could think of. Now the sirens of the
limelight-switches beckon to policy-
framing for a whole United World.
But it is growing more and more like
a desperately partitioned world —a grand-
scale enlargement of that mess into which
Dr. Evatt steered Palestine 12 months ago
and plumed himself on doing so. The
new Western Union, shaping towards an
even stronger Atlantic Union, offers no
good auguries for that conviction which
Dr. Evatt expressed last January, during
a brief period of self-repatriation:
If U.N.O. can be kept alive for two or
three more years it may become virtually
impossible for another shooting war to
break out within our lifetime U.N.O.
must survive and mature, for it is all we
have.
That was addressed to the United States
people. To Australia, where the national
view of foreign affairs has been sup-
posedly a purely Evatt prescription, this
was good enough:
I look to the future of the United Nations
with optimism. Democratic, peace-loving
countries like Australia must accept portion
of the great task of reconciling conflicts of
interest and ideology which are causing ex-
treme international tension.
Let nobody ask what or how—or even
who —without risk of lese-majeste. “The
professional mourners of U.N.0.,” said
Dr. Evatt, “have proved wrong. Look at
how it can do things—look at Palestine.”
These views were, and are, shared by
few. The present Secretary for External
Affairs in the Canadian Cabinet, Mr-
L. B. Pearson —of whom the London
“Spectator” wrote: “Few men speak with
more, knowledge, discernment and objec-
tivity”—returned from the same scene
with anything but Dr. Evatt’s enthusiasm
for U.N.O.’s prospects. From a Toronto
platform he told an attentive Western
world:
There are three courses which, in face of
difficulties too well known to need descrip-
tion, appear to lie before U.N.O.
It can carry on, or drift on, in the hope
that the general atmosphere may improve.
It can determine to amend the Charter,
and, if that is frustrated by use of the veto,
can disband itself and form a new organi-
sation bn a better basis, open to all States
which will give it support.
Or the present Charter can be retained
and within it, in full consonance with its
provisions, those States which desire can
form a collective system for mutual defence.
Mr. Pearson indicated that he preferred
the last-named.
Washington unofficially said “Hear,
hear!” and the “Spectator’s” comment
was: “This is tantamount to a confession
by a number, probably the majority, of the
members of U.N.0., that U.N.O. has
failed in one of the main purposes of its
existence. Since that is demonstrably
true.,.. .it is wise to recognise the truth
and face the consequences.” Professor
Gilbert Murray has delivered himself of
the same opinion. General Eisenhower
a few months later told the American
Legion that “the world is now divided
into two great camps —grouped on the
one side around dictatorships which
subject the individual to absolute control,
and on the other around democracy,
which provides him with a free and un-
limited horizon,”
U.N.0., as now constituted, is for any
practical purpose as dead as mutton.
That has been made daylight-clear by the
wrangling over Berlin, the utterly futile
ex9hanges at Moscow, and the declared
and venomous politics of the Kremlin,
which are directed to the defeat of the
European Recovery Programme and the
perpetuation of anarchy, misery and
despair in Europe. It is quite vain for
Dr. Evatt to maintain, as he did when
last before the House of Representatives,
that it is not U.N.O.’s job to make peace
out of the late world conflict, but rather
to maintain peace once it has been estab-
lished by the chief Powers. The point
requires no argument that if Soviet
Russia, whose malicious propaganda and
use of force against the other Powers’
efforts to set Europe on its feet are a
travesty of the U.N.O. Charter, refuses
any small measure of collaboration in the
making of peace, then it is only wishful
thinking to expect help from the same
quarter in maintaining any peace once
made.
The Russian hostility to any service of
that purpose declared at the Moscow
conference of 1943 (after Russia had ad-
hered to the Churchill-Roosevelt Atlantic
Charter), namely—
The necessity of ensuring a rapid and
orderly transition from war to peace and
establishing and maintaining international
peace and security with the least diversion
of the world’s human and economic re-
sources for armaments —
is an affront to any peace-seeking society.
There is no place for such a Russia in the
organism operating the United Nations
Charter.
Leadership of a real United Nations
such as the Canadian Minister visualises
will probably go not to satisfy some per-
sonal ambition, but to the representative
of that nation which brings to the task
the qualifications of resolution, resources
and the power to take command in action.
Defence, Is It?
The statements on defence made by
Ministers Chambers and Dedman during
last week paint a clear picture of the
kind of hands in which Australian de-
fence rests at present.
Mr. Chambers led off on September 21
with the assertion that Field-Marshal
Montgomery, whom he characterised as
“a great friend of Marshal Stalin” —the
two marshals have seen each other about
three times —“considered that Russia
would not be able to wage war within
10 years.” Mr, Chambers said that
Field-Marshal Montgomery “spoke of
Stalin often and favorably,” a viewpoint
which apparently accorded with the
Minister’s own, -and that he “thought
Lord Montgomery’s views were reliable.”
And on that basis, he said, the Gov-
ernment had “made all the plans that
could be expected for defence three years
after the war.” Within two days after
Mr, Chambers spoke, the Field-Marshal
made him look ridiculous by urging
the immediate development of strong
defences.
Mr. Dedman, who behaved like a
coursed hare, turning and twisting to
meet a fire of pertinent interjections from
soldier-members of the House, obviously
did not agree with Mr. Chambers, and
neither did Mr. Chifley. For Mr. Ded-
man quoted the latter, in preference to
the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,
as declaring that so far from being un-
ready for war for 10 years the Russians
were “so strong that they could initially
sweep right through to the English Chan-
nel.” However, he believed that, “from
the long-term world-strategy aspect,
when the forces of the great democracies
were arrayed together the position was
much different,” and he added comfort-
ably that the United States was the only
country which had the atom bomb, and
that this made it clear that the situation
“did not demand a large army.”
Mr. Chambers gave a solemn assurance
that the cadets of Duntroon were being
taught the use of the atom bomb, an aerial
weapon, and one which no cadet or in-
structor at Duntroon would be likely to
recognise if he saw it.
Australia at present has not a single
aircraft which could carry an atom bomb.
It has no material for making one and
no means for making one, and it is clear
that the United States and its intimate
allies are not likely to trust Messrs. Ded-
man, Chambers and their colleagues with
even the more common knowledge about
bomb technique while the Australian
“Labor” party goes arm-in-arm with
Communism.
The Government is not, of course, de-
pendent entirely on Mr. Dedman and Mr.
Chambers for defence. There are also
Mr. Riordan, in charge of the Royal Aus-
tralian Navy, Mr. Drakeford, command-
ing the Air, and a Minister for Supply
and Development, as well as Messrs.
Chifley and Evatt.
All this flock or gaggle of Ministers
is jointly concerned in the scheme which,
in five years’ time, at a basic cost of £250
million, Mr. Dedman believes devoutly
will represent “a substantial commitment
in Empire defence,” of which the “long-
range weapons range” was the main
scientific item.
This project, in any case, is a British
baby, and like everything else which ever
has been allotted to the Chifley Govern-
ment to carry out, is subject to “some lag
in planned expenditure because of short-
age of labor and materials, but not to the
extent of interfering with the programme
of the trials.” This is a modest state-
ment of the difficulties and delays which
are being encountered on the rocket-
range.
An R.A.N, strength of 14,753 is con-
templated, manning a fleet of ships of
which the leviathans will be two light
aircraft-carriers discarded in 1947 in pro-
cess of building by the Royal Navy. At
June 30 last actual naval manpower
strength was 10,676 ; the Navy was ad-
vertising for men, and the building and
manning programme was well behind in-
tention, However, “steps will be taken
presently to remedy the shortage”—steps
it is to be hoped which will be more suc-
cessful than the Government’s previous
efforts of the kind.
Naval construction is in the same posi-
tion. Two Battle-class destroyers—obso-
lescent types already—are being built,
along with “four varying class de-
stroyers,” but these small items “have
been delayed because of slow deliveries
of materials and the difficulty of obtain-
ing working drawings from Britain.”
Australia is not finding it economical or
practicable to provide its own plans.
The Army plan is on much the same
level as the naval one. Mr. Chambers in
five years of desperate campaigning pro-
poses to build it up to “a total post-war
strength of 19,000 permanent and 50,000
citizen .forces.” The citizen forces are to
have about a fortnight’s training with
the most limited materials during the
year, directed by generals, brigadiers and
lieut.-colonels in the time they can spare
from busy civil occupations.
There are now in the regular, interim
and other “armies” which are supposed
to be “permanent” and semi-permanent
including the reserve —about 20,000
officers and men, most of them occupied
in clerkly duties or in going through ele-
mentary training. And Mr. Dedman has
the effrontery to say that an intake of
182 recruits a month is “satisfactory”!
Over the enlistment for the citizen army
he has drawn a veil. The greatest enlist-
ments have been in units which own kilts
and which find overseas affiliations speci-
ally attractive. It is doubtful if the whole
enlistments obtained after months of
Government advertising and the combing
of football-grounds by enthusiastic re-
cruiting-officers would be enough to fill a
brigade group. The 8.C.0.F. in Japan is
being whittled down to a stage where it
could easily become lost among the
Japanese population.
Britain has conscription, exercised in a
limited way, and will have 825,000 men
in the forces undergoing a minimum of
twelve months’ training by January, 1949.
Russia has conscription of virtually every
person, male and female, from seven
years old upwards. The United States
has limited conscription, and its civilian
committee on the subject has vigorously
contradicted Mr. Dedman’s easy view-
point that compulsory training is “in-
appropriate to the country’s present need.”
The R.A.A.F. parallels the other forces.
The Government claims to have 16 opera-
tional squadrons in being. They are only
in token form, with 8000-odd enlisted
men against the total of 13,092 called for.
Enlistments are dribbling in at the rate
of 111 a month. But if all the resources
of the alleged 16 squadrons were pooled
in manpower and equipment they could
not provide, at short notice, a single fully-
trained effective squadron on a war basis.
There is no continental radar network,
and the men and material for ground
co-operation do not exist on the present
establishment.
It is foolish for “Labor” to talk about
the defence of Australia. At present there
is no defence worth the name.
Free Show at the Stadium.
Discussion as to whether the Eastern
Suburbs railway is to go through, round,
under or oVer the Rushcutter Bay
Stadium was suspended for a space last
Thursday night while the Temple of
Stoush was given over to a bout of verbal
fisticuffs between a Communist and a
Catholic priest. Billed as a debate on
the subject “That Communism is in the
best interests of Australia,” the contest
attracted a crowd estimated at 30,000 —
the biggest roll-up since the Bums-John-
son fight in 1908.
After Referee • McClelland had intro-
duced the contestants and called for
“Order-r,” Comrade Edgar Ross came
out of his corner throwing punches in all
directions —mostly Left-hooks and under-
hand jabs. Very few of them connected, as
the people they were aimed at all seemed
to be a long way away—in Wall-street, in
London, on Malayan plantations, in
Collins House, Melbourne, and in other
alleged breeding-grounds of Capitalistic
Intrigue. Apparently satisfied that his
hammer-and-sickle blows had sent his
phantom opponents out through the
ropes, he took time off to sing the praises
of the “strong, secure, stable and pros-
perous Soviet Union” (cheers and booing,
“Order-r, rorder-r! ”), of which he claimed
“in no country of the world were human
rights so explicitly acknowledged.” More
cheers, more booing, more Rorder-r. A
few blows at those in the Catholic Church
who were “trying to split the ‘Labor’
party.” Some pats on the back for the
“Labor” party, whose “platform of
socialisation is also the platform of the
Communist party.” More pats on the
back for Daniel O’Connell and other
Irish Catholics. Cries of “Don’t crawl.”
“Rorder-r!” Time.
Round Two found Dr. Ryan shadow-
sparring with the ghosts of Hegel and
Marx and a spectre he addressed as
“Dialectic Materialism.” Warming up a
little and shifting his feet, he aimed some
straight rights at Moscow. The Kremlin
was probably unmoved, but the Stadium
responded. Cheers drowned jeers—
“ Order-r, rorder-r! ” He then threw slabs
of Lenin and Stalin at Ross and struck
several body-blows that brought a large
section of the audience to its feet.
A particularly telling blow concerned
the question of religion in Russia —Ross
had claimed there was no religious per-
secution. Ryan stated that of 13 bishops
in Russia 11 were dead or in exile and
two missing, and “when a person is miss-
ing in Russia he stays missing.” As the
bell went he threw a question at his
opponent: “What is the attitude of the
Communist party towards the King?”
This brought Ross out for the next round
well on his guard. He parried with dark
hints of a “loaded question” and
“security-officers waiting to take down
what I say," and went on to explain that
his party had nothing against his Majesty
“as an individual.” They viewed him as
a symbol of the monarchic system of
imperialism, etc. Boos, laughter, “Order-r,
rorder-r! ” ,
Dropping his caution, Ross rushed
into the attack again, swinging wildly at
the Catholic Church. For the rest of the
contest the fight was Rome versus Mos-
cow, with Ryan scoring the best hit,
almost a technical k. 0., on a matter of
medals, Ross accused the Vatican of
supporting Fascism, Mussolini, Franco
and Hitler, and said that the Pope “even
gave a medal to the traitor'Laval.” Ryan
admitted the bestowal, but pointed out
that the medal was given when France
was still a free democracy, “ten years
before Laval became a Quisling.” He
added: “But it was not the Pope who
decorated the butcher Von Ribbentrop
with the Order of Lenin,”
The Bulletin’s Religious Editor, who
has slept through sermons in churches
of every denomination extant in
Australia as well as a few now extinct,
and its Stadium Reporter, who has seen
more title fights than any “Labor” publi-
can or politician, agree that Ryan won
every round. They are also in complete
agreement as to the futility of this type
of contest. The Communists do not enter
into a debate in order to win it or for
the pleasure of arguing under Parliamen-
tary rules. Thursday night’s debate gave
Edgar Ross an audience of 30,000 —a
greater number than any Communist in
Australia has ever been able to address
before.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Mr. Chifley and Mr. Taylor.
In the Representatives last week Mr.
Abbott, in the course of an attack on the
Government’s allocation of $1,189,110
to Metropolitan Portland Cement for
the purchase of second-hand plant in
the U.S.A., said that if Mr. Chifley
was “so simple and innocent” as to have
agreed to allocate dollars to the com-
pany without knowing the name of
Arnold S. Taylor (closely associated with
its promotion), he was not fit to be Prime
Minister.
Mr. Taylor’s record as a company-
promoter has been touched on in The
Bulletin already. In the Metropolitan
Cement float he figures as a vendor of
certain shares for which he is to receive
£72,964 in new scrip or cash under one
contract, and £16,497 under another.
Mr. Taylor also signed the estimate of
profits included in the prospectus.
Mr. Taylor previously attempted to float
two other cement concerns; they never
functioned as cement-manufacturers, and
his theory that metropolitan production
of cement is more economical than manu-
facture at the site of the chief raw
materials has not been put to the test.
One at least of Mr. Taylor’s schemes,
however, went a little further. It was
Coal Oil and By-products, Ltd., formed
at the end of 1940 to supply “vaporiser
fuel” to motor-vehicle owners putting up
the cash to pay for retorts at Berrima,
N.S.W. “As the result of police investi-
gations,” reported the N. S, Wales Crown
Solicitor in 1942, “it is perfectly clear
that this company has not carried out
its obligations.” Mr. Taylor agreed that
this was so, but said one reason was that
“the supply of power kerosene,” used by
the company for “fluxing purposes,” had
“abruptly ceased.”
The N. S. Wales Crown Solicitor
commented: “Notwithstanding the rea-
sons put forward.... there is evidence
that at this time agents of the company
were still canvassing for people to pur-
chase interests in the retorts to be
erected.” Mr. Taylor said on March
17, 1942, that “production by the end of
May is expected to reach the rate of one
million gallons per annum.” But on
May 13, 1942, the N.S.W. Assembly was
informed by Attorney-General G. E.
Martin that "several firms” were “still
not receiving any fuel,” though the com-
pany was getting “power kerosene at the
rate of 2500 gallons a week.”
The police, “in the course of their in-
vestigations,” found that Mr. Taylor ran
another co., Mudgee Shale Oil Pty.,
objects of which were “practically the
same” as the Berrima concern.
In May last, refusing an inquiry into
the administration of Mr. Ward’s Depart-
ment of External Territories following
J. S. Garden’s conviction, Mr. Chifley
told a press conference that he “watched
the administration of Government depart-
ments pretty closely.” In the Metropolitan
Cement case Mr. Chifley had a more
direct association, as Treasurer, with the
allocation of the very large dollar credit
for plant-purchase. Yet he had “never
heard of Mr. Taylor.” Didn’t R. G.
Hamilton, N.S.W. “Labor” M.L.A. for
Namoi and a director of Metropolitan
Portland Cement, tell him about Mr.
Taylor when he (Mr. Hamilton) saw Mr.
Chifley “on one occasion” on matters to
do with Metropolitan Cement? Mr.
Hamilton addressed the N.S.W. Legisla-
tive Assembly the day (in May, 1942)
the Attorney-General gave the informa-
tion about Mr. Taylor and the “Coal Oil”
concern. Obviously Mr. Chifley should
listen as well as “watch”—and read
“Hansard,” even if he chooses to ignore
the morning papers.
For Power and Freedom.
Up on the Bogong High Plains and
down at Morwell Victorians have
under way two vast projects aimed to
serve two ends: a big increase in the
power and light resources of the State,
and freedom from the costly caprices of
N.S.W. coalminers. The Bogong hydro-
electric works are to cost £25 million, the
Morwell brown-coal project £2O million.
Properly known as the Kiewa scheme,
the Bogong works will place a series of
dams and power-stations on the Kiewa
River in the Mt. Hotham district. The
stations are deep underground so as to
provide necessary falls of water to turn
the turbines —and, incidentally, they
would be reasonably safe from air
attack should it ever develop. It will be
the biggest Australian hydroelectric
scheme to date, and will develop 289,000
kilowatts (387,000 horsepower), with an
average annual output of about 1000
million kilowatt-hours of electricity. Pro-
gressive extensions will increase the total
generating capacity to 956,000 kilowatts
by 1956.
Kiewa is part of the State’s long-range
electricity plans, and is related to the
enlargement of Morwell-Yalloum. The
two systems will provide most of Vic-
toria’s electricity, and, when common-
sense prevails and the Snowy waters are
developed as a south-eastern Australia
project rather than as a purely State
matter, they will be ready for whatever
use the future holds for them.
The Morwell scheme is based on a
brown-coal field estimated to contain
6000 million tons, and as a by-product
of the briquette-making—each of the 20
presses will turn out 140 tons of briquettes
a 24-hour day—the station will produce
about 300 million kilowatt-hours of elec-
tricity a year. Not the least important
feature of both schemes is that a very
large proportion of the machinery, heavy
and light, is being made in Australia.
. These are not mere plans. The work
is going ahead now on the Kiewa and- at
Morwell. In the midst of industrial
anarchy in other parts and political shen-
anigans in the nation’s political capital
they strike a refreshing note.
A Poor Excuse.
Pressed by the North Queensland Cham-
bers of Commerce to state exactly what
he meant when he said that his Govern-
ment would “recommend the establish-
ment of additional Statesi in Queensland
when, as a result of its [his Government’s]
developmental policy, the new States will
have a reasonable degree of financial and
economic stability,” Premier Hanlon
found time before he left for London
to dash off a reply, the substance of
which was: “It is the considered opinion
of the Government that the establish-
ment of a new State in the North, with
the present population and industries,
would be liable to financial collapse in
the event of a fall in metal prices co-
inciding with a severe drought.”
North Queensland, somehow, refuses
to be impressed by the Premier’s paternal
determination not to let it strike out on
its own until he has given it “financial
and economic stability,” largely because
it has been listening to that sort of thing
for 50 years. As “N.Q. Register” puts
it;
Just how rich does the North have to
become ? This part of Queensland has
a “big four” which boosts its economy—
sugar, wool, meat and metals... .Townsville
acts as clearing-house for a large-enough
portion of the products to demonstrate the
colossal natural wealth of North Queens-
land. This year metals mined from this area
to the estimated value of £4,500,000....
£3,000,000-worth of sugar while meat and
by-products worth £3,000,000 will be cleared
from Townsville docks. W 001.... approxi-
mately 100,000 bales are transported through
this city each year; in round figures, worth
this the imposing sum of £5,000,000.
Those figures apply only to Townsville.
Cairns, Mourilyan, Lucinda Point, Bowen
and Mackay are also receiving and re-
directing the impressive golden flood of
wealth springing from the soil.
To which it might be added that all
the railway freights and fares, road taxes,
stamp-duties, port dues and other State
revenues entailed in the business men-
tioned goes to Brisbane, all the income
and other Federal taxes to Canberra
(from which remote capital the State’s
share of them passes to Brisbane, where a
Government which becomes aware of the
North only at election-time decides where
and how the revenues shall be spent).
In any event, N.Q. New-Staters are
fully aware of what financial liabilities
a new State would face in its formative
years, but they’re quite prepared to face
them, being confident that increased
population and development will not
come until the North manages its own
affairs.
Population Problem.
Professor G. S. Browne, of Melbourne
University, says a condensed report,
quoted B. 15/9/’4B, and comments “on
an address by me at a Pacific conference”
in Brisbane “are misleading,” and adds,
“I wondered if you would be interested
in what I really did say?” yery much
indeed:
I gave an account of the adventures and mis-
adventures of Hawaii in regard to immigration,
and suggested the following lessons for Aus-
tralia :
(1) That we must have migrants in increasing
numbers if we are to hold our continent suc-
cessfully. Seventy thousand a year is our present
policy, but we need 200,000 a year if our
population is to reach 15,000,000 by a.d. 2000.
(2) That, being a nation of democratic British
stock, we should give preference to British
migrants if we can get them.
(3) That the experience of U.S.A. shows that
we need not be afraid of introducing European
migrants of good stock, such as Scandinavians,
Baltic peoples, Germany and good-type Latins.
The selection needs to be carefully made.
(4) We should give attention to the strengthen-
ing of our own democratic beliefs and pro-
cedures in order that we may be certain of our
ability to assimilate these migrants and turn
them into good and satisfied Australians.
(5) There is little evidence that Australian
opinion is likely to move away from the White
Australia policy, but that policy should be
administered in such a way that our Pacific
neighbors arc not given offence.
(6) Occasional sweeping generalisations in
Australia that mixture of races necessarily re-
sults in moral and mental degradation are not
well founded. If the stocks are poor it is true,
but in New Zealand there is no stigma in having
Maori blood in one’s veins. A Vice-President
of U.S.A. was one-quarter Indian, and Will
Rogers was half Cherokee.
(7) The experience of Hawaii shows that the
Chinese-Hawaiian blend is often very successful,
some of the products becoming prominent pro-
fessional men and really effective citizens, men-
tally and morally.
(8) If ever Australia found it necessary to
depart from her White Australia policy, it
should be only in the direction of a small
controlled quota of very good stock, such as
high-grade Chinese.
All fair enough; but let’s hope the
Commonwealth never finds it “necessary
to depart from” the White Australia
policy. To strengthen such a hope we
must deal with some of our internal poli-
tical problems very soon.

CARRERAS LTD. - OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
POLITICAL POINTS
General attitude of the press on the
appointment of Our Foreign Policy as
president of the General Assembly is that
it will bring Australia prominently before
the eyes of the world. If it does, people
in other lands must be vastly better in-
formed than those of this country. How
many Australians could name the man
whom Dr. Evatt has just succeeded? Or
even say what country he represented?
Sydney “Morning Herald” has given
prominence to an article by Brian Doyle,
associate editor of the “Catholic Weekly,”
in which he asked how individual Roman
Catholics in the “Labor” party could
reconcile their consciences with “Labor’s”
socialisation objective, and challenged
“Labor” Cabinet Ministers of his faith,
whom he named, to state where they
stood on the subject. He also spoke of
“proposals for the formation of an inde-
pendent political party based on Christian
principles.” The gentlemen named pre-
served a stony silence, but during the
week there was much talk of proposals to
trim down the socialisation plank at the
current conference of the A.L.P. —prob-
ably on the principle that a stinkweed by
any other name will still flourish in
empty blocks.
There’s nothing so catching as a bad
example. Emboldened by the action of
N.S.W, “Labor” in introducing pensions
for members on a non-actuarial basis,
Federal Caucus has instructed Cabinet to
bring in a similar scheme. Present sug-
gestion is that a contribution of 30-bob
a week will bring a defeated or retiring
member £8 a week for life. Minimum
service eight years; minimum age-limit
45 ; money back for those dropping out
before becoming eligible. The main fault
found by Caucus was not that the tax-
payers will have to subsidise the scheme,
as they undoubtedly will, but that the
age-limit might penalise younger men.
The unspeakable Ben Hecht, who
placed his name to lying slanders against
British troops in Palestine, has stooped
to libel the dead. In New York he
spoke of Count Bernadette as “an ass
who wasn’t worth so fine a death a
professional catspaw hired to pull chest-
nuts from the fire for the British.” Berna-
dette worked for peace in Palestine,
knowing he risked death at the hands
of terrorists. Hecht carries on his poison-
pen-work thousands of miles from any
danger-zone,
A summons under the Crimes Act has
been served on Brisbane Communist
Gilbert Burns charging him with using
seditious words. It alleges that in answer
to questions as to the attitude of Aus-
tralian Communists in the event of war
with Russia he said, among other things,
“We would oppose that war. We would
fight on the side of the Soviet Union,”
or words to like effect. When the inci-
dent was first reported Communist leaders
claimed that Burns was not voicing the
policy of the party. The sentiment cer-
tainly expresses the feelings of British
Communists; at the week-end Harry
Pollitt, at a Red rally in Liverpool, told
his followers “We must create mass feel-
ing that British workers will never work
nor fight for a war against the Soviet
Union.”
Most fatuous remark of the week;
“Security might not be as vital to Britain,
because of its geographical position, as it
was to Australia, which was conducting
rocket-range experiments and had wide
open spaces,” Perpetrator, Calwell.
Prize, bound copy of his speeches with
boners underlined for easy reference.
Fadden followed up Harrison’s charge
that the Chifley Budget, which claimed
increases in the export of meat and dairy
products last year of 17 and 21 p.c. respec-
tively compared with the pre-war year,
was disproved by the Commonwealth
Statistician’s figures showing a decrease
of 10 p.c. in meat and an increase of only
17 p.c. in dairy products—butter and
cheese down 11 p.c. As to Chifley’s ex-
cuse that his figures were taken from “the
new index,” Fadden observed that
farmers weren’t concerned with indexes,
but with the fact that production had
fallen and exports declined.
First big question to hit U.N.O. under
Dr. Evatt’s presidency is the Berlin one.
The British, American and French
Foreign Ministers threw their hands in
at the week-end after Moscow had re-
fused to lift the blockade and demanded
control of all traffic between the West
and the unhappy city. It was accom-
panied by the usual Moscow abuse, there
were brawls in Berlin, and the British
Government was preparing big defence
measures. After Vyshinsky had called
sundry Britons and Americans “war in-
stigators,” Dr. Evatt weighed in with;-
While not so conciliatory as some had
hoped after General Marshall’s speech, Mr.
Vyshinsky was by no means so uncompro-
mising in tone as many had forecast.
Thus has the spirit which deals with
Australian Communists been transported
to U.N.O.
In announcing that two Australian
bishops—Dr. Burgmann of Goulburn and
Dr. O’Brien, Auxiliary Bishop to Cardinal
Gilroy—would act as advisers to the
Australian delegation at U.N.O. General
Assembly in Paris the Prime Minister said
the two clerics “could be of great
assistance in advising on non-political
matters.” Well, at least Eris O’Brien
hasn’t been noticed in the political hurly-
burly, but the same can’t be said of the
wearer of the other pair of gaiters. Bishop
Burgmann’s name appeared last month
with those of Dean Hewlett Johnson —
excluded from the United States for
Communist associations —and Ilya Ehren-
burg, a propaganda official of the Soviet
Government, as patron of the Australian-
Russian Society from which the N. S.
Wales A.L.P. has just dragged Clive Evatt,
Eddie Ward and other “Labor” members
bv the hair of the head. The N. S. Wales
A.L.P. has so far made no comment on
Bishop Burgmann’s appointment.
Donal’ Grant during the Budget debate
took the Senate on a verbal Cook’s tour
round the globe, surveyed mankind from
China to Peru and history from the days
of Nipponese Jimmu Tenno to the Atomic
Age and after. For the most part he
enjoyed himself as much as if he’d been
on his old stand in the Domain, but
when someone interjected “Doc Evatt
told you that” he saw red —a color never
far distant from his inner eye—and said
in effect that the Doc wasn’t the only man
in the party who understands world affairs.
Quite right, too. Didn’t Bert take Donal’
to Paris once as his adviser? And wasn’t
he flown back post-haste because his vote
was needed in the Senate?
Literary gem of the year should be the
edition of the “Continental Daily Mail”
containing a supplement on Australian
affairs. It includes articles by eight (8)
Federal Ministers.
As a sequel to an incident in Rose
Bay (Sydney) when four persons—two of
them women —were allegedly attacked by
thugs, a 26-year-old boxer was confronted
last week with a variety of assault
charges. He was remanded on bail of
£5OO. As a sequel to the sequel E. E.
McQuillan, a boxing trainer, next day
pleaded guilty to having behaved offen-
sively at Paddington police-station, where
he had claimed that the arrested man
“was one of his boys,” and that the
detective was “putting it over him.” He
j subsequently expressed sorjqpw, but too
late to save a £3 fine,
Falstein, M.H.R. for Watson, barrister-
at-law and importer of watches, was on
Friday convicted on six Customs charges
and fined £320, with £55 costs. He was
charged with having presented, through
his agent, invoices which were not genuine,
and having made, through his agent,
entries in which the value for duty of
watches and watch movements was
understated. Isles, S.M., in his judg-
ment, said the evidence of the prose-
cution was uncontradicted and must be
accepted. He was satisfied that Falstein
was the owner of the- goods imported
and that Preston was lawfully authorised
by him to make arrangements for their
importation. It could not be inferred
from the evidence that Preston knew the
invoices were not genuine or that false
entries had been made. “Falstein, if en-
tirely innocent, could have entered the
witness-box to contradict the facts alleged,
and to prove by his own testimony lack
of knowledge and absence of complicity.”
Suggestions by defending counsel that
the charges had been brought “recklessly,
with sectarian and political motives,” Mr.
Isles found “totally unwarranted and en-
tirely out of place.” He had no doubt
that Falstein was guilty of the offences
charged.
Falstein’s counsel asked for a discharge
without conviction, pleading that his
client had an “unblemished career” and
had only committed “a technical offence
against a revenue Act.” The S.M. refused
to assent. Later Mr. Justice Owen granted
a stay of proceedings, and an appeal is
proposed.
The Chifley crowd must wish that
they’d never entered that N.Z. wheat deal.
It bobbed up again in Fadden’s attack on
the Budget, when he pointed out that,
though the Government was saving £25
million in wiped-out subsidies, it still had
an increased expenditure:
I put this question to the Treasurer:
In view of the Government’s decision to
withdraw subsidies, will whcatgrowers have
to sacrifice their subsidy on wheat sent to
New Zealand and be reimbursed to the
extent of only a little more than 6s. a
bushel, or will the Australian Government
continue to subsidise the N.Z. Government
(which, of course, means subsidising the
cost of living in N.Z.) and refuse to sub-
sidise Australian potatoes, whole-milk,
clothing, raw cotton, etc.? These, of course,
are the chief factors in the Australian
housewife’s living costs. ,
Perhaps Mr. Pollard should abolish
wheatgrowing.
The triennial conference of the Federal
A.L.P. is to discuss the establishment by
the Government of a national newspaper,
“under the control of an impartial com-
mission, free from Government control.”
New South Wales executive is to urge that
members of the commission be appointed
“solely on the basis of capacity, integrity
and impartiality.” But surely no “Labor”
appointment has ever been made on any
other basis?
Premier Hanlon descended upon
London full of grand schemes for “step-
ping up sugar exports to Britain, involv-
ing £2 million sterling capital expendi-
ture, mainly for milling.” Whereupon
Food Minister Strachey said he’d been
told by the visitor that Queensland’s
sugar export to Britain could be increased
to 500,000 tons p.a. (Britain bought
300,000 tons this year) within a few
years. There was a lot more, but not a
word about the time it takes to load a
sugar ship in a Queensland port.
Socialists in Britain, at any rate, know
what Dedman’s defence scheme is worth.
A motion has been tabled in the House
of Commons by a group of British Labor
members asking the Government to pro-
pose next month to the Dominion Prime
Ministers that they should form “a
neutral bloc” of their territories in the
event of war. Clearly the idea is based on
the hope that then Britain and America
would not have to defend them.
Watersiders at the small North Queens-
land sugar port Lucinda Point have re-
fused to obey a Stevedoring Industry
Commission order to admit additional
members. There are 42 of ’em, and in
order to clear up the backlog of cargo
the S.I.C. asked them to increase their
number to 57. Lucinda wharfies load
sugar at a contract rate of ss. 9|d. a ton,
and shipowners claim that their pre-war
rate of 800 tons a day has slipped down
to 530 tons. The additional men would
bring it up to about 670 tons. Wharfies
at Lucinda, as elsewhere in Australia,
give lip-service to socialism, but aren’t so
keen on the share-the-wealth principle
when their own pockets are concerned.
At their present strength their yearly earn-
ings are somewhere round £lOOO a man.
Mr. Calwell and the Communist-led
Miners’ Federation have “agreed” on the
employment of Poles and Balts in the
coalmines. Agreed, that is, on the Federa-
tion’s terms that employment of immi-
grants underground will be controlled by
the Federation, the immigrants must join
a union, must have a working knowledge
of English and of mine-safety regulations.
Fair enough, perhaps, but Mr. Calwell
won’t say whether or not he agreed to
bring out potential miners only in “small
batches.”
Queensland, which has the most ports
of any State, is concerned about the ex-
pected rise of 10s. and 3s. a ton for
general intra-State and inter-State ship-
ping freights respectively. Rates of
61s. 6d. Brisbane-Sydney, 68s. Brisbane-
Melbourne and 695. Brisbane-Townsville
are tipped, though Acting-Premier Gair
says his Government will “control”
freights if necessary. There was a 75.-a-
-ton increase granted on inter-State rates
last month; shipowners had asked for
10s. Still, when the grand Socialist ships
start steaming round the coasts these
grasping capitalists will learn.
It is being freely said that McKenna
admits the B.M.A. has prevailed with
its arguments for holding off the half-
baked “free-medicine” scheme, but that
McKenna has to persist because it is
“ ‘Labor’ policy.” McKenna’s recent
statements suggest this as the correct ex-
planation, and it is notorious that
Socialists jnake a great show of trying to
hatch their own eggs though all the world
declare them rotten.
The futile Stevedoring Industry Com-
mission, after trying to kid everybody
that the slow turn-round of ships was in
part due to the ships now carrying more
cargo, somewhat joyfully announced that
except for the Queensland strike in March
there were no major waterfront hold-ups
in 1947-48. It had hardly got the report
out when Sydney wharfies stopped work
for a week because they couldn’t get 12
instead of 10 men to a wool-sling. But
perhaps the S.I.C. doesn’t regard a week's
idleness on Sydney wharves as a “major
hold-up.”
Industrial Court action is threatened in
Brisbane as a result of friction between
the A.R.U. and the Railway Traffic Em-
ployees Union. Early .in the year the
R.T.E.U. refused to join in the railway
strike, and since the settlement hundreds
of A.R.U. men, fed up with being used
as guinea-pigs for Red revolution, have
switched over to the R.T.E.U, Others
wanting to do the same complain that
A.R.U. officials have refused to give them
clearances. There’s a lack of consistency
among Commo-controlled unions. The
wharfies don’t like letting new members
in; the railwaymen don’t like letting old
ones out.
Clarence Hart Campbell, managing-director of
Asian Airlines —the concern that was refused a
landing permit by the Malayan Government —
and a co-owner of Marx House, must have had
burning ears for a few days last week. At a
Civil Aviation inquiry into the suspension of the
licence of J. E. Wood, a former engineer of the
company, counsel referred to Campbell as “a
very smooth gentleman, who has prevaricated,
shuffled, and side-stepped important questions
put to him in the witness-box,” and Wood
claimed that Campbell had on two occasions
threatened “to see Arthur Drakeford” and have
his licence cancelled because he (Wood) had
refused to sign-out a Catalina aircraft as air-
worthy. Campbell denied having made such a
threat, and in the House of Representatives at
Canberra Air Minister Drakeford in reply to
a question denied knowing Campbell. As a
result of the inquiry Wood’s suspension was
reduced from six months to three. As the six
months ran out the week the decision was given
his position is slightly better than that of the
condemned man whose death penalty was com-
muted to life imprisonment five minutes after
the trap fell.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Len Sellars, who has retired from
managership of Thos. Cook’s Sydney
branch, believes that psychologists, dip-
lomats and students of human nature
couldn’t do better than to take a spell at
handling Cook’s tours. He ought to know
—he’s been shepherding tourists into and
out of practically every civilised spot on
the globe since the turn of the century.
And not always from his office. He’s per-
sonally conducted trips throughout Aus-
tralia and New Zealand, Java, Malaya,
Bali and Japan. He rates as the biggest
draws in their respective countries:
Waitomo cave in Maoriland’s North
Island, where myriads pf glowworms
carpet the underground-river roof with a
twinkling mosaic of green and red; irri-
gation ditches in the Indies ; Jo’burg gold-
mines in S. Africa; first-war graves in
Europe ; and the Blue Mountains at home.
Still fit at retiring age—he captained
Victoria’s Rugby fifteen for three years—
Sellars golfs, doesn’t fish except where
they suicide, and takes his own holidays
at home.
With a jaw like a kauri stump and a
face burned to leathery toughness, Major
C. A. Whyte, late of the Black Watch in
Peshawar, stamped in, barked for 10
minutes on experiences covering half the
globe and stamped out again. He has
plenty to bark about. Joining the regi-
ment —of which Queen Elizabeth is
Colonel-in-Chief —as a ranker in 1899,
he served in the Khyber Pass and Central
Provinces with Field-Marshal Wave!!,
then a fresh-faced subaltern. He sailed
for the Boer War in 1901, returned to
India and joined the Calcutta police.
Restless again, an opening in the Burma
Oil Co. set him travelling through Bengal,
northern Assam and Burma. He clewed
up in Australia in 1908 and sailed with
the First A.I.F. for Gallipoli as a lieu-
tenant. Two nasty wounds collected
there caught up with him again in France,
requiring an eight-months lay-off in
England, Back in Australia, he took on
accountancy. Now, presidency of the Aus-
tralian Black Watch Association and sec-
retaryship of the South African Soldiers’
Association use up some of the surplus
energy which, even at 66, makes the sea-
soned veteran a very near approach to
perpetual motion.
The Rev. G. Kennedy Tucker, of the
Brotherhood of St. Laurence, once
focused attention on the iniquities of the
Landlord and Tenant Act by squatting on
the verandah of a house whose tenant,
an old woman, was threatened with
eviction. He’s likely to cause a rumpus in
another quarter by his latest suggestion
for the cure of alcoholics. He proposes
that churches should take over or open
and run hotels in the way they should be
run, all profits to be expended on improv-
ing amenities for customers and educat-
ing them in more enlightened drinking.
The Rev. Mr. Tucker works in a part
of the city where the derelict alcoholic
is fed on metho by disreputable saloons,
and he knows more than enough about
the problem. What the Trade thinks of
this prospective competition hasn’t been
disclosed.
“Trinco”: Lester B. Pearson (Mike to his
intimates), Canada’s new Secretary of State for
External Affairs, brings wide experience to the
job— most of his political life concerns his
country’s external affairs. After flying with
the R.F.C. in the first scrap a crash got him
a return to Canada. With a B.A. in history
from Toronto University, he went on to Oxford
and left with its 8.A., plus an M.A. and his
hockey and lacrosse blues. First contact with
external affairs was made when, in 1928, he
entered the department as First Secretary. From
then on travel and experience widened together:
1930, International Law Conference at The
Hague and Naval Disarmament Conference in
London; 1935, First Secretary in the High
Commissioner’s office in London; 1941,
Assistant Under-Secretary for External Affairs
back in Ottawa; 1942-43, extensive experience
with U.N.R.R.A.; 1944, when the Canadian
Legation in Washington was accorded embassy
status, Pearson was the Minister, with a step-up
to Ambassador the next year; and, in 1946, he
became Under-Secretary for External Affairs,
which position he was holding when Mackenzie
King announced his impending retirement.
Pearson’s own external affairs centre round the
brilliant bow-tie invariably winging his Adam’s
apple; his tie collection is renowned even in a
country where the adornment is not exactly
unknown.
Brian Doyle, whose Sydney “Herald”
article on the dissatisfaction of Catholics
with the “Labor” party is still causing re-
percussions, is an academic young man
whom a State bursary took to Marist
Brothers’ College at Randwick. With his
B.A. from Sydney Uni., and the family
coffers low, he took a job in the Public
Library, and in his spare time won a
Public Administration diploma and
studied law for two years. An appetite
for journalism developed, and he dove-
tailed in with his studies editorship of
the Catholic monthly “Fireside.” In
1944, after a spell in the Army and a
period with the Department of War Or-
ganisation of Industry, which engendered
a bad taste for bureaucracy that the
present breed’s done nothing to wash
away, he became associate-editor of the
“Catholic Weekly,” his present job. Be-
hind a quiet, almost deprecating exterior,
Doyle hides a useful will and a bright
mind.
“Fitz” farewells a mate:
R. J. Cassidy, who went west at Waverley
(N.S.W.) last Sunday, wrote many splendid
bush rhymes—who now remembers “At Piker’s
Pub”?—and countless amusing “Aboriginalities”
for The Bulletin under the pen-name of
“Gilrooney.” Bob, one of the shyest of The
Bulletin’s army of bush balladists, nailed from
Coolac (N.S.W.) and as a young man roved
the Far West of N. S. Wales as a bush laborer,
miner, carpenter and painter. Always a staunch
A.W.U. man on his wanderings, he joined the
editorial staff of the Australian "Worker” in
his late twenties and remained with that paper
(except for a brief period when he wrote for
the “Barrier Truth” and edited the Broken Hill
“Sport”) until shortly before his death. Dur-
ing his earlier years with the “Worker” that
Labor weekly, under the editorship of H. E.
Boote, was the most brilliant radical sheet in
Australia, and Bob’s pen was as bright and
sparkling as any of its team of lively writers.
He published two books of verse, Land of the
Starry Cross and Gipsy Road, a novel, Chandler
of Corralinga, and was well represented in the
anthologies. One of the founders with Tom
Mutch of the old )Vriters and Artists’ Union,
which later became known as the A.J.A., Bob
was a loyal trade-unionist to the end and a
constant battler for the bloke who had re-
ceived a raw deal. A keen cricketer and a
billiard-player in his younger days, he spent
his eventide years on Jong bush walks with
Rod Quinn, brother-poet and lifelong friend.
Bob’s widow, Lucy, is well known in Sydney
literary circles for her work in the cause of
Australian literature.
Most of the Cornishmen who came out
to South Australia in the early days of
the colony settled around Moonta for
the dual purposes of mining copper and
providing raw material for Oswald
Pryor’s Cousin Jack drawings, but there
were exceptions. One Redman, who
settled in the south-eastern part of the
E. C. REDMAN,
new clerk of S.A. Legislative Council.
State to develop a grazing property, was
grandfather of Ernest Came Redman,
Clerk of S.A.’s Legislative Council.
Here sketched by Coventry, E.C. went to
Westralia as a young man and became
secretary to the superintendent of a
mining-engineering company. Then he
went off to World War I and served in
France as a sergeant-major in the 48th
Battalion. This possibly stood him in
good stead when he subsequently returned
to his home State, joined the Parlia-
mentary staff and became the Council’s
Serjeant-at-Arms. At one time he played
grade cricket and lacrosse ; nowadays he
sticks to gardening.
With a background of degrees and
diplomas, Dr. Hubert Penny goes to head-
ship of Adelaide Teachers’ College, where
he has been senior lecturer since 1937. At
Adelaide ’Varsity he collected his B.A.
and M.A., the Diploma of Economics and
Diploma of Education, before going to
London Uni. on the State’s Education
Department’s two-year travelling scholar-
ship.
The lined, Hollywoodesque face here
revealed by Dubois is owned by Ted
Geach, N.S.W. commissioner for Toe H.
In business-life a public-relations officer
for Sydney National Bank, Geach rates
tolerance next to godliness, and instances
the innumerable friendships he has made
among all classes of men resulting from
exercising it. Toe H members recently
built a house for a less fortunate ex-
Digger, bank-managers sweating side by
side with tram-guards—that sort of thing
develops a fellowship you can’t get in
your best clothes. In the organisation
since 1925, Geach conceived the next
year the germ of the idea that the Red
Cross expanded into its present blood-
TED GEACH, of Toc H.
bank. He carried in his pocket a list of
blood-donors, told hospitals where he’d
be each night, and as transfusions were
needed they rang him and he provided the
name and address of a life-giver. A
long, genial cove, he saw action in New
Guinea with the 2/25th Infantry Battalion
—or, as the Yanks called them, “the two
slash two-five walking outfit.”
Rupert D’Oyly Carte, who died in
London at the age of 72, was a
member of that family whose affinity to
Gilsullivan opera is akin to that of
oysters to stout. Son of the late Richard
D’Oyly Carte, lord of London’s Savoy
Theatre for so many years, Rupert in-
herited the Gilsullivan-Savoy interests in
1913, gradually expanding them to in-
clude the New Claridge, Savoy and
Berkeley hostelries, of which he became
chairman of directors. Under his direc-
tion the comic-operas of the famous col-
laborators were played not only at the
Savoy but at Sadler’s Wells and the
Prince’s, and he took companies on tours
of Canada and the U.S.A.
The Rev. Father Adrian Martin, “Bish”
to the Navy, was educated early in
the century at the Parade, East Mel-
bourne, completed his ecclesiastical
studies in Rome in 1917 and went straight
to hospital ships as an A.I.F, chaplain.
After the Armistice he was stationed at
Bacchus Marsh, Moonee Ponds and
Mornington till in 1921 he joined the
R.A.N., where he served seven years, first
in the original H.M.A.S. Sydney, later
in cruiser Adelaide when she made a
world cruise in 1928. After. leaving the
Navy “Bish” was 10 years at Mentone
and was then given the job of collecting
£lOO,OOO to complete the spires of St.
Patrick’s Cathedral, Melbourne. He filled
the coffers so well that he was chosen
to organise the recent Diocesan Catholic
Centenary celebrations.
Subject of Lambart’s sketch is Frank
Arthur Cooper, Lieutenant-Governor of
Queensland. Born in Blayney (N.S.W.),
one of 12 children, Cooper found jobs
scarce in the little country town and
graduated to the city, ending up in the
Sydney Anglican Diocesan offiep. West-
FRANK COOPER.
Queensland’s Lieut.-Governor.
inghouse Brake Co. sent him to N.Z. in
1900, and, on return, over most of Aus-
tralia’s eastern seaboard. Embroilment in
strike trouble in Ipswich (Q.) cost him
his job. Shortly after he was elected
Labor member for Bremer (Ipswich),
which seat he held continuously for 31
years. From Minister for Education he
went on to Treasurer, and finally Premier
in 1942-46. A genial man, Cooper re-
laxes on the amateur stage.
From Mary Gilmore:
Seppclts’ front - cover advertisement (B.
15/9/’4B) reminds me that when I was a child
my Irish grandmother told me a tale of the
siege of Derry which, by connection, is also a
story of Australia. The defence of Derry is
one of the stories of history. There was almost
no food, even cats were eaten, and the last
shots (moulded of anything the defenders could
find in forges and factories) had been fired.
James IPs besieging troops were already mount-
ing scaling-ladders when a Mrs. Lindsay called
to the other women to fill pots and kettles on
the fine. As fast as the attackers climbed the
walls the scalding water smothered them, and
Derry was saved. That woman was the
ancestress of our Lindsays. L first heard the
story about 1873, and again, over 60 years
later, from Lionel Lindsay. We both had an-
cestors in Derry, and mine never forgot Mrs.
Lindsay.
Philip R. Le Couteur (“Pip” to the lads
he headmastered at Sydney’s Newington
College for the past 16 years) has called
it a day. In his time the school has
almost trebled its numbers. A product
of Melbourne Uni., where he won a triple
blue in cricket, football and lawn-tennis,
he added an Oxford cricket blue while
there with a Victorian Rhodes scholar-
ship in 1908, A member of Westralian
Uni.’s original staff, he controlled the
Methodist Ladies’ College in Melbourne
for 11 years before transferring to New-
ington.
Two young Diggers, Robin Boyd and
Douglas A. Norman, have won the travel-
ling scholarships of £350 awarded under
the Haddon Bequest by the Royal Vic-
torian Institute of Architects. The sub-
ject, an art gallery hypothetically situated
at Mildura, was possibly suggested by the
fact that ex-Senator R. D. Elliott some
years ago presented his collection of
Orpen pictures to the dried-fruit metro-
polis, which hasn’t a building in which to
house them. Boyd is a tutor at the
University School of Architecture, and
has been running the “Age” small-homes
section.
Into the Silence;
At 69, in Melbourne, Archdeacon H. M.
Hewett. Ordained in 1902, he was a curate in
several Victorian towns before coming to St.
Philip’s, Collingwood, and St. John’s, East
vern. He was chaplain to Melbourne’s Arch-
bishop during 1922-24, and was appointed arch-
deacon in 1938.
In London, Lord Noel-Buxton, who was
A.D.C. to his father, T. Fowell Buxton, when
he was Governor of S.A. in 1896. He was
wounded by a political assassin while on a
Balkans mission in the first war.
At 63, in Adelaide, where he was a dentist
for many years, Dr. Ernest Joseph Millhouse.
After registering in S. Australia, he collected
his D.D.S. at the University of Pennsylvania,
U.S.A., and later the Degree of Dentistry at
Edinburgh Uni. Eric Millhouse, K.C., is his
brother.
In England, Lady Twyford. Born in Port
Adelaide, she became Lady Mayoress of London
for 1937-38, the first Australian to do so.
At 62, in Brisbane, J. D. Ross, Queensland
Auditor-General. Starting in the railways, he
entered the A.-G.’s department as an accounts
inspector. He made many special investigations
for the Government, and was secretary to
several Royal Commissions. #

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS "
“Plop”: With the imposing literary
background of Sydney’s Public Library,
there is a gentleman petrified in bronze
on the right of the entrance to that hall
who gives an impression of might suffi-
cient to make any pigeon think twice.
He sports a decorated swOrd, collar and
breast. He has tassels on his belt, and
a broad cloak completes the regalia. Folk
entering the library might mistakenly
think that the aloofness of his faintly
upturned nose refers to them; you have
to take the line of sight from his eyes
to see where he really directs his scorn.
He is looking straight at the Shakspearean
group across the road, his mien suggest-
ing that he might have once been part
of that crew and that on some dark night
old Falstaff and the others got together
and lugged him over to his present possie.
A small boy was passing him the other
day. The lad was at an age where he
found it hard to keep up with his mother,
just old enough to read the plaque “Sir
Richard Bourke, K.C.8.,” yet not quite
old enough to give the reverence de-
manded. With a belligerent glance, and
the cry “Ya big show-off,” he stripped it
of its haughtiness and trotted on,

“Zake”: It is refreshing to observe that
solid confirmation has come for Dr.
Evatt’s considered opinion that Dr. Evatt
is a truly great statesman. The fact that
such confirmation has come from the
Soviet’s Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshin-
sky makes it all the more valuable and
will certainly confound Bert’s non-Labor
critics. Where those arch-muddlers
Marshall and Bevin have by their in-
transigence given the false impression
that the U.S.S.R. was deaf to all reason-
able entreaties, Bert has shown the way
and given hope at last to a tortured
world. His technique, developed ration-
ally from his experience in dealing with
our own Commo union-leaders, is so
simple that it is a wonder nobody thought
of it before —just agree with them. By do-
ing this at his very first meeting as
president of the U.N.O. General
Assembly he earned a rare encomium
from Russia. All Bert has to do now to
preserve world peace is to urge Bevin
and Marshall to follow his example,

“Jasby”: A Yankee advertising man,
“to find out how honest people were,” is
reported to have pushed a barrow of
dollar-bills around the streets of St. Louis
for four days, often turning his back on
it. No one, says the report, took a single
bill. That’s no proof of the honesty of
St. Louis/ citizens. If it proves anything
it merely demonstrates their lack of trust
in the man with the barrow, as obviously
no one believed the bills were genuine.
It is merely a modern version of the old
chestnut about the man who stood on
London Bridge offering to sell sovereigns
for a penny and got no takers. Personally
I’ve never believed the London Bridge
yarn. Even if no one reckoned the jimmy
o’goblins were real it would be apparent
that they were at least darn good imita-
tions, and there would surely be some
enterprising Cockneys prepared to take a
risk on a few penn’orth. Come to think
of it I don’t believe the St. Louis tale
either.
“Hoop”: A Sydney store is featuring
street-scene photographs, colossally en-
larged with bas-relief trickery, and
showing, against a background of folk
in street clothes, some gentlemen in abso-
lutely nothing. 'First appearance of the
display coincided with the Olympic
Games, so it possibly refers to the classic
days when they used to run barefooted.
A suggestion from a hard-hit taxpayer
is that the unclad gentlemen are a glimpse
of next season’s styles. Supporting the
latter theory are remarks the Finns are
reported to be making about their new
1000-mark banknote, which shows a copy
of a famous painting in which 13 naked
figures are staring into the distance. The
Finns claim this represents their popula-
tion watching the last shipment of repara-
tions leave for Russia.

“Flathead”: If there is enough ammu-
nition left in our plundered defence
magazines for a 21-gun salute, let it be
fired, I have found a Sydney tram-
inspector with a sense of humor. As
this gent with the badge came calling
for our tickets the passenger beside me
gave me a knowing wink, pulled out a
fistful of tickets from his pocket,, and
whispered “Never missed yet.” After
saying he had put his ticket in with the
collection, the grinning passenger invited
the inspector to pick it out. With an
even wider grin the inspector asked the
chap how many sections he was travelling,
told him the approximate serial number,
and suggested he should find it himself;
he added that he would call back when
he had been through the tram. Some
time later the smart passenger was still
frowning through them when the guard
“I think I'll swallow me pride and tell her all is forgiven”
came around and told him that he could
stop now, as the snapper had got off four
stops back.

“Bo”: Touching on strange interments,
can any historical example match for the
macabre touch that of Franz Joseph
Haydn? The composer died and was
buried in Vienna a few weeks after
Napoleon captured the city in May, 1809.
Eleven years later, when his body was
exhumed for removal to Eisenstadt, on
the estates of the Esterhazy family, whose
Master of the Orchestra Haydn had been
for over quarter of a century, it was dis-
covered that the skull was missing. It
transpired that, two days after the burial,
two officials had secretly opened the grave
and removed the head, their object being
to use it to test the theory of phrenology
Apparently no action was taken against
them for desecration, but they promised
to return the skull to Prince Esterhazy. A
skull was sent, but years later, when
one of the thieves died, he bequeathed the
true Haydn skull to the museum of the
Viennese Society of the Friends of Music,
and revealed that Esterhazy had been
tricked. Long and involved legal action
got the family nowhere. They had built
a magnificent mausoleum to house the
composer’s remains, but refused to com-
plete the rites until the true skull was
forthcoming. It was not until 1938, when,
having “absorbed” Austria, it became
high policy for Hitler to cultivate
Hungarian friendship, that the question
of the Haydn skull was revived, for the
still-powerful Esterhazy family had at the
fall of the Austro-Hungarian empire
transferred the family seat to Budapest.
The Nazis ordered the skull to be yielded
to the Esterhazys, and 130 years after
his death Haydn’s complete skeleton
found permanent resting-place.

“Spokeshave”: Typographical errors
aren’t confined to newspapers. A Mel-

The poster artist, possibly thinking about
his immortal soul, made it “Into the Fry.”

“F.S.”: Since Alfred Felton, no big
private art patron has come to light in
Melbourne, so the recently established
Council for the Advancement of Aus-
tralian Art proposes to go a different way
about it. Its dream is to raise £25,000
by art exhibitions, balls, gatherings and
private or public donations and to invest
it to provide an annual £lOOO for the
best Australian picture. As Archibald
has already provided for the portrait-
painters, subject-matter will be open. The
council has the best intentions, but in
one respect it has started off on the
wrong leg. It is proposed provisionally
to limit entries to those artists who have
had two years’ training at an art school.
The art school would presumably be one
that the council approved, but his-
torical precedent has shown that the
schools committees approve of have
generally been the wrong ones, and plenty
of the most significant painters never
attended any, or, if they did, heartily dis-
approved of them later. The Prix de
Rome, the most important art prize in
Europe, has been running for 100 years,
but no great artist has yet won it.

“Quizzed-out”: I have no objection to
the Prime Minister’s banning Von Skerst
from the National Quiz —that’s his busi-
ness, though it would be interesting to
know whether he would have taken
similar action had a notorious Communist
been in the same position—but I can't
agree with the criticism of the Loans
Organisation for allowing the man to
compete in the first place. The set-up for
the elimination contest was that the
general public was invited to answer a
series of questions, top-scorers to become
eligible for the radio quiz. Did the
critics expect the organisers to vet the
political record of every candidate before
handing him a question-paper? Failing
that, unless they knew the ex-Nazi by
sight, the judges would have no way of
telling whether his name was Von Skerst,
Macgillicuddy, Ramsbotham or Sniggle-
heimer until his answers were passed in,
and it is a generally accepted principle
in all competitions that you don’t change
the rules after the game is over.

“Radian”: In touching on the Lutana
disaster, “M.S” (B. 15/9/’4B) mentions
mysterious oil-patches on the sea, which
could have come from a crashed air-
liner. Oil-patches—quite common in
regular shipping-lanes—usually originate
from the filter discharge of oil-burning
ships. Filters are blown out once in
every watch and discharge a quantity of
oily sludge in semi-solid form. This
sludge is buoyant, and in calm weather
will often spread an oil-film over many
acres of sea.

“Boolswool”: Another centenary. In
September, 1848, Richard Goldsbrough
commenced business as a woolbroker
where now stands the Yarra Family
Hotel in Flinders-street, Melbourne. This
was the beginning of Goldsbrough, Mort
and Co. The first company was formed
in 1881 by an amalgamation of the part-
nership of R. Goldsbrough and Co. with
the Australasian Agency and Banking
Corporation. Richard Goldsbrough, who
died in 1886, was one of the prime
movers in establishing the auction system
of selling wool. Three years after his
death the firm’s Sydney interests were ex-
panded by the purchase of the business
of Mort and Co. (formed by T. S. Mort
in 1845), and the name was changed to
Goldsbrough, Mort and Co., Ltd., under
which title the company at various times
acquired the businesses of Harrison,
Jones and Devlin, of Sydney, Bagot,
Shakes and Lewis, of Adelaide and Perth,
Henry Wills and Co., of Perth, and
Badgery Bros., of Sydney.

“Ack”; Sub-editing Shakspeare (B.
1/9/’48)? A country paper made a fair
job of it. “Books in the running brooks,
sermons in stones,” was “corrected” to
“Sermons in books, stones in running
brooks,” a transposition that was much
more understandable to the majority.

“Uramao”: A printer’s error for which
I was to blame in my apprentice days

was an elder of the kirk and his son a
lay preacher. What they said when they
read in bold type: “Brown and Son, the
Direct Imposters” would not have amused
the presbyters.

“Laetitia”: That Dafnley Island tipple
(B. 15/9/’4B), whatever its alcoholic
potency, was certainly not kava. The
Torres Strait native has a handier and
less messily prepared source of exhilara-
tion than the South Seas product, which
is unknown in those parts. This local
brew is tuba, obtained by cutting the
young green shoots at the top of the
coconut-palm and allowing the resultant
secretion to distil into gourds. Fermen-
tation is rapid, the liquor changing in
a few days from a small beer to a knock-
out fluid of the valency of torpedo-juice.
Now that “Young Slim” has presumably
recovered from his post -tuba headache
he may derive some comfort from the
knowledge that he drank the liquor of
warriors. This was formerly Binghi’s
source of Dutch courage when he went
to war in quest of heads, ingredients for
his cannibal stpckpots or marriageable
maidens.

“Eureka”: Should Eden (N.S.W.) be
developed as a deep-sea port, much of
the credit for the early development of
the district must be given to the Imlay
brothers. The three brothers, George,
Alexander and Peter, explored and took
up large areas of land there in 1825,
opening cattle-stations at Pambula, Can-
delo and Bega. For the next 20 years
they worked hard in developing the coun-
try, but in 1846 George accidentally shot
himself while hunting, and three months
later Alexander died. In recognition of
the work of the brothers, the Imlay
Shire and Mt. Imlay are named after
them, also Dr. George Mountain, near
Bega.

“Muskeen”: It was in 1796 that Sir
Ralph Abercromby, not Sir John Moore
(B. 15/9/’4B), was so impressed by the
steady and intrepid bearing of the 27th
Regiment, now the Royal Inniskillmg
Fusiliers at St. Lucia. Not only was the
regiment’s “King’s” color displayed on
the citadel for one hour before the hoist-
ing of the Union Jack, but the French
garrison—2000 strong —was ordered to
lay down its arms to the 27th. Inci-
dentally, St. Lucia was the first distinc-
tion on the regimental colors, although
the regiment had already been in existence
for 107 years.

“M.S.”; Thousands of wooden
patterns, some nearly a century old, were
destroyed when part of the Phoenix
Foundry at Launceston was gutted by
fire. It was the second outbreak in recent
months, and the owners might be par-
doned, even by the unsuperstitious, if
they changed the name of their plant.
They look on the bright side of the legend,
however. The following day the manager
announced that the foundry would be in
full production within a fortnight, and
that same day work recommenced on
the ashes of the night’s disaster.

“Mullum”: I object to being called
“entertainment mad” simply because my
radio is on from the time I arrive home
in the evening until I go to bed. What
Bulletin correspondents and Chief Justice
Latham fail to realise is that much of the
sound from the set is “background
music,” which does not interrupt a con-
versation, light reading or the wife’s one
plain two purl. My radio is functioning
softly as I write; although I could not
tell you what the wireless has been play-
ing during the last quarter-hour, I would
be aware immediately if it was switched
off.
IN PARIS.
“Fiery and even quarrelsome discussions are likely
at the U.N. sessions but the mollifying effect
of French catering and the loveliness of Paris itself,
ever lavish with delights, may occasionally tone
down the bitterness. — “S, if. Herald” correspondent.
In this luxurious setting none belittles,
Where Art and Nature lavishly combine,
Think you that acrimonious transmittals
Of angry words will steadily decline,
Lulled by the excellence of Paris victuals,
Soothed by the taste of France’s choicest wine,
And will reaction to surroundings find
For one and all a happier frame of mind?
Will gloomy Slav and men of Latin breeding,
Arabs and Jews and all the rest as well,
Note their antagonisms fast receding
Under a glamorous city’s magic spell,
Take to calm argument and measured pleading
Instead of giving one another hell?
What blessings to the world therefrom might
flow
If it were so —if only it were so!
I’d say these mollifying influences
Might be more cheerfully predicted, though,
If they had worked where charity commences
Proverbially—that’s at home, you know —
Where Gallic deputies scorn all pretences
Of Parliamentary punctilio,
Snarling and scrapping in a fashion that’s
Associated with Kilkenny cats.
Still, we may hope that, in a job demanding
So much, the stimulating Paris air
May set the spirit of goodwill expanding
Among the delegates assembled there,
Fill them with wisdom, grace and understanding
(I’m quoting from a near-forgotten prayer)
As well as the amenities that spring
From eminently lavish catering.
N.S.W.
PIPARDS.


“Gravelsnatcher”: An Australian
p.-0.-w. recently received a letter from the
daughter of a widow on whose farm in
Bavaria he worked for a couple of years.
He had arrived at the farm in a state
of emaciation and perpetual hunger. The
Bavarians welcomed him and his mates,
fed them liberally, asked of them no un-
congenial work and genuinely rejoiced as
the flesh returned to their frames. Fol-
lowed a time that was happy by almost
any standards —until the German army
crumbled. In the joy of liberation much
was forgotten and overlooked. Pausing
only to reassure his hosts that the in-
vading allies from the. West were not
barbarians, the Australian made across
country to join the spearhead of the
American advance. The letter recalled
it all —vividly and in forceful language.
“And now,” it continued, “you are living
in a land of plenty, with an abundance
of food and clothing, and with never a
thought of us, as we hunger and shiver
in the winter you knew so well. You
have not even had the decency to write,
as you promised you would.” Within
an hour a remorse-stricken man had dis-
patched three parcels and an air-mail
letter. But he knew that he had been
forgiven. The letter, written in German,
began “You Dog” and ended “Your
loving friend, Frieda.”

“Percy P.”: Cables report the death
at a well-cashed and respected old age of
the chap whose great achievement was
writing “The Prisoner’s Song.” The
words of that ballad were tripey to the
point of nausea, but there was a catchy
"Not a word — I’m a stowaway !”
melody and it went round the world. Still,
I doubt whether the man who scooped
this wealth from the sale really wrote the
music. It is much the same as that of
many old narrative songs of the “Wild
Colonial Boy” genre, and bears an em-
phatic resemblance to one which opened
with “Oh I wish X had ten thousand mil-
lion dollars.” The ballad went on to say,
in quite a number of verses, that even
with all the money in the world the singer
would still not be satisfied with life. A
final verse conveyed that if he was com-
pletely surrounded by beer the illusive
satisfaction might be obtained. It was a
rough effort; but the words anyway were
better-phrased than those in the song for
which the air was borrowed.

“Alive Corpus”: Sydney Morgue and
Justice Department’s intention to rebuild
(B. 15/9/’4B) is fulfilled as far as the
morgue is concerned. A month ago I
inspected the entirely rebuilt morgue at
the rear of the Coroner’s Court, lower
George-street, and was shown a modern
refrigerating cabinet, capable of contain-
ing 15 cadavers. It is built of stainless
steel, as is the equipment of the post-
mortem room. In fact the morgue savors
more of the operating-theatre of a large
modern hospital than the generally mis-
conceived idea of marble slabs and white
shrouds. There are also a modern kitchen
and bedroom for the attendant, whose
duty it is to be there 24 hours a day.

“Flip”: Our spaniel has suddenly
ceased to swing from the postman’s
trouser-cuffs, a mystery which defied
analysis until yesterday, when I came
across the following in the advertisements
of the London “Times”:
Train your dog in elementary obedience
and road safety fry correspondence course;
trained dogs are happy, safe and content;
prospectus and. full details from Secretary,
National Canine Defence League, 8 Clirford-
street, London, W.l. There are several
other epurses.
Only time will tell what course the dog
has taken from the school. I cannot see
him voluntarily learning “elementary
obedience,” but from the old inner-tube
he scrounged from somewhere recently
and now drags about in an amazing
manner on the lawn we surmise that he
is about to “Make a Hit with the Ladies”
by developing his biceps,

“Spokeshave”: Melbourne used to have
a stage horse which had as long a run
in the theatrical business as Allan Wilkie
(B. 15/9/’4B). It belonged to Melbourne’s
last cab proprietor and was always called
on when theatrical producers were in need
of an equine Character, its owner proudly
keeping it in prime condition. When
the “Don Quixote” ballet 'was put on
at His Majesty’s, however, a more emaci-
ated beast was needed to depict Rosin-
ante. The management innocently made
known its requirements, but no owner
of a half-starved neddy came forward- —
very naturally, as the law regarding the
care and upkeep of horses is stringent
and well-policed in Melbourne. A com-
promise was finally effected, and the old,
fat cab horse duly appeared bearing
the melancholy knight, the false ribs
painted on its sides being as transparent
a piece of make-up as Laurence Olivier’s
in “Richard III.”

“W.P.T.”: If ever any of the Snowy
River schemes are put into operation and
the rough country at the head of the
river thoroughly explored it is possible
that two mysteries
will be solved. Many
people in that dis-
trict believe the air-
liner Southern Cloud,
lost on a flight from
Sydney to Mel-
bourne, will be
found in the rough
country at the head
'of the Snowy. An-
other mystery that
might be cleared up
is the story of a
nugget of gold larger
than any on record.
Many years ago two
prospectors returned
to Dalgety with a
story that they had
found a nugget so
heavy that it was im-
possible to get it out.
They brought a bag
of small nuggets and
some chips as evi-
dence of their find,
intending to take an
expedition back to
help them get the
treasure. The excite-
ment in Dalgety was
so great that half the
town got drunk, in-
cluding the two pros-
pectors. One died as
the result of the
spree, and the other
was so badly affected
that he could not remember the exact
location; he tried many times to lead
men to the nugget but never succeeded.

“Lawnstob”: A fellow with 144 prior
convictions, who was fined £3 10s. at
Launceston (Tas.) for being found drunk

alibi which motorists might envy. He
claimed that he couldn’t be said to have
been in charge of the horse, which was
such a terribly good one that it always
saw him home.

“L.E.X.”: An experience unique in the
Victorian Police Fingerprint Branch—the
finding of a fingerprint “in reverse” —was
largely relied on by the Crown as evidence
in a safebreaking case recently. On the
“That beastly puncture held us up for half an hour—give her the
Works , Pat!"
morning after a robbery the police found
on the door-knob at the rear of the shop a
perfect thumbprint in reverse—a print
made not by the ridges of the skin, but
by a white powder that had filled the
“valleys” between the skin-ridges. Thus,
instead of dusting thb print with white
powder and photographing the result the
police photographed the original print and
got what they wanted. The Crown
maintained that that print and one
taken direct from the prisoner tallied ex-
actly. Twenty-one months’ imprisonment
was dished out.

“South Coast”: Mention of Hobart’s
trams (B. 8/9/’4B) recalls the conductor
I heard bawl to the Sandy Bay crowd:
“Come on there. Hurry up and take
your time: another day tomorrow.” And
Tassie conductors seem to be the kindliest
in the Commonwealth. I’ve seen them
pull up and wait while belated passengers
came running, and then allow them to
get aboard on the wrong side, or to
scramble in past the man at the wheel.
A Launceston tram stopped halfway up
a steep hill for the benefit of a woman
who had changed her shoes for felt bed-
room slippers and got off the tram to
leave the shoes at the bootmaker’s. And
she didn’t intend to pay another fare. “1
hopped off, but I hopped on again,” she
explained. And the conductor let her get
away with it.

“Lower Tops’l”: Consternation was
caused at Ocean Grove (Vic.) recently
when a skull and other human bones un-
earthed by erosion were found by three
men strolling along the top of the cliff.
Police were called, and crime records
were scrutinised while the bones were
sent to the Government pathologist for
examination. When the report came back
that the bones had been buried “for a
considerable time,” the township’s oldest
inhabitant remarked: “They have that.
There was a cemetery there once. It was
closed long before my time!”

“Ceg”: Those “Clean Beds Is. 6d.” (B.
8/9/’4B) remind me of an experience in
Melbourne many years ago. I paused
with a friend outside a gloomy sort of
place in Bourke-street where beds could
be had for sixpence. As we peered into
a dim passage lit with a flickering fish-
tail gasburner a decrepit-looking bloke
on a cigarette-butt crawl addressed us.
“I wouldn’t advise you gents to doss in
there,” he said, pointing to the murky
entrance. “The beds are a bit crummy.”
We felt the advice was well-meant if mis-
placed. Later on, looking up the dic-
tionary, X found that “crummy” means
“Plump, comely and rich, slang pertain-
ing to women;” Just what did the butt-
hunter mean?

“Waddlin’ Willie”: Professor J. Mac-
donald Holmes’s The Murray Valley (B.
12/5/’4B) recalls an interesting phase in
the life of Hugh McColl —pioneer irriga-
tionist whose persistent advocacy was the
genesis of Victoria’s irrigation schemes.
Generations ago, when farming in north-
ern Victoria was only a hopeful vision,
he established an irrigation block at Gun-
bower, now a flourishing dairying settle-
ment in the Murray Valley. As a mem-
ber of the Victorian Assembly he was
continually fighting for a canal system
linking one centre with another. During
one session he produced from his bag
some peaches, pears, potatoes and onions
and passed them round the House.
Although he implored Members not to
lock up the land “that could grow such
produce,” the House was not sympa-
thetic. On an occasion in the early
’eighties he was the guest of Samuel
Wilson—an M.L.C. who was a squatter
near Ballarat. Wilson asked “How can
you have these schemes with our scanty
population? Irrigation has been a suc-
cess only where people are very numer-
ous.” McColl ignored the question and
asked his host for some sugar. When
the sugar was brought McColl spread a
little on the bare gravel path, later invit-
ing Sir Samuel to inspect it. There they
saw it thick with ants. “That is what
irrigation will accomplish, filling up the
area now bare of people,” said the fight-
ing irrigationist. Holmes’ book is a
testimony to the saneness of the old Scot’s
vision.

“Beecham”: The self-serve department
at its latest. At Pinjarra (W.A.) the
Road Board has promised local rate-
payers that they can have electric-light.
But the ratepayers have had to dig the
necessary holes and cart the poles to
the spot. Now the Road Board gener-
ously offers the labor to erect the poles,
and says that it will buy the necessary
cable and engage an electrical contractor
to connect up the houses. “But,” adds
the Road Board, “the ratepayers must run
out the cable themselves.”

“Metax”: Arrived at the works at
eight a.m. to find the office ransacked ;
rang the police-station and related the
details. After a patient hearing a drawl-
ing voice inquired, “Have you got the
burglar there?” A negative reply pro-
duced a satisfied grunt. “Righto, then.
We’ll be around at nine o’clock to have
a look.”

“Silver Bullet”; In a city restaurant
seeking a late supper I read “Our Chef’s
Suggestions” and decided on something
light. “I think I’ll try a little asparagus
on toast,” I told the waitress. “No
toast,” she replied. “Well, what about
a hamburger?” “No hamburgers!”
“Brains and tomatoes?” “No brains.”
“Then Til have a ham sandwich and a
cup of tea.” I got that all right, but now
I can’t make out why the chef made his
suggestions.
* * * *
“Pawang”: A British Labor peer. Lord
Amwell, in the course of a debate on
fortune-tellers and users of subtle craft,
claimed to be a psychic medium and an
automatic writer who had found himself
writing “perfectly intelligible messages
about concurrent happenings of which I
could not possibly have knowledge.” This
opens up some interesting possibilities for
politicians as well as voters. A member
of the Government might be intensively
trained in automatic writing until he was
able to reveal what the Opposition in-
tended to do in the, next debate on price-
control or something and vice versa. The
Taxpayers’ Association could train up a
member to find out what Mr. Chifley is
contemplating about his surplus. All that
is necessary is for the medium to attain
a state of complete relaxation so that
his left-hand doesn’t know what his right-
hand is doing.
PERRY AND SNUFF.
“Price-controls have been lifted on some 30,000
items in New South Wales, the range extending from
pianos, motor-cycles and second-hand cars, to collar-
studs, drinking-straws, slate-pencils, perry and
snuff.”
You never dreamed, in New South Wales the
sunny,
How many articles there were to buy
(That is, assuming that you had the money)
Till price-controls arrived. No more did I.
We found for total, when in print we got ’em.
That fifty thousand would be near enough,
Pianos at the top, and at the bottom
Perry and snuff.
How like the elephant, our powers reigning
At Canberra, whose trunk will take a glut
Of solid provender, while not disdaining
The proffer of a lolly or a nut!
Think of the time and trouble they were bound
to
„ Expend on summarising all the stuff
We buy (or sell), from motor-cycles down to
Perry and snuff.
OTO keep inflation back, it’s doubtful whether
There’s anything those eagle eyes evades,.
From scraps of bone that hold your shirt together
To straws through which you sip your
lemonades.
They aimed to stop not only those deluding
Chaps to buy high-priced cars by bounce and
bluff,
But vendors of more lowly goods, including
Perry and snuff.
Controls are off on much that figured thickly
In our requirements, coupled with a threat
That those who shove their prices up too quickly
Will soon be given something to regret.
So watch your steps lest you be left bewailing
Acts that authority may deem too tough,
You birds who, higher enterprises failing,
Look for a modest competence retailing
Perry or snuff.

* After providing £175,000 for possible fall in stock-
values.
The contraction of £36,871 in the latest
profit figure is more apparent than real.
Turnover was a record, and the £134,665
was written after allowing for deprecia-
tion (£84,091, down £3685) and taxation
(£210,000, up £117,270) and making
special provision (£175,000) against “pos-
sible reduction in replacement value of
stocks of raw materials.” Still, it was
enough to pay the pref. div. and show
24.2 p.c. on the £522,000 of ord, capital
as against 29.1 p.c. on average capital em-
ployed during the previous term. Includ-
ing the special provision, some, or all, of
which might turn out to be genuine profit,
the year’s net figure was £138,129
stronger at £309,665, which covered pref.
requirements and over 57 p.c. on ord.
capital. So repetition of the 14 p.c. div.
caused the board of this robust 14-year-
old no concern.
Olympic Cables, Ltd., which took over
the infant electric-cablemaking section
(established in 1940) of the parent’s busi-
ness at end 1946, has also given a very
good account of itself. It netted £43,971
for the year to end June last, or enough
to cover its own pref, div. and 21.6 p.c.
on its £191,459 of ord. capital, on which
a 13 p.c. div. was paid. So shareholders
have nothing to complain about on
account of the reshuffle. Holders of
the original £1 ords. received three f.-p.
ss. ords. in the Tyre co., plus one f.-p.
ss. ord. in the Cable co. On the basis
of last term’s distributions they received
divs. aggregating 13£ p.c. on the face-
value of their original holdings, as against
Hi p.c. in 1946. They also had the
opportunity of taking up £1 5 p.c. pref,
shares at par—198,857 in the Tyre co.
and 100,000 in the Cable co. And the
Cable co. will presently offer those on its
ord. register 490,164 new ss. ords., 64
for 100, at a premium of 6s. each.
Since war ended, demand has been
running ahead of expanding production
in the rubber-manufacturing industry.
On the tyre and tube side, which accounts
for the bulk of the co.’s turnover, the
following comparison of motor-vehicle
registrations in Australia (service vehicles
excluded) is a pointer to what has hap-
pened ;

Although shoeing of new vehicles has
fallen short of early anticipations, owing
to the dollar shortage, restricted output
of bodies and other problems, the call
for replacements has been heavy. Still,
the physical volume of Australian tyre
production for the year to end June last
was 22 p.c. below the 1938-39 level.
While the new all-Australian car (the
Holden) being turned out by General
Motors-Holdens will help to stiffen de-
mand for tyres and tubes, the fresh petrol-
cut, which comes in on October 1, will
considerably reduce mileage, and there-
fore lengthen the life of tyres, for private
motorists. What effect the unrest in
Malaya and Indonesia will have upon
the supply and price of raw rubber re-
mains to be seen. Output of American
synthetic promises to act as a price regu-
lator. To date the main problem of
tyre-producers has been to get adequate
supplies of skilled labor and ancillary
materials, including carbon black, mainly
a dollar commodity.
Continued expansion and provision
against delays in delivery of raw materials
are features of balance-sheet figures:

The £198,857 of new pref. capital, to-

used to carry £127,022 more stocks,
£35,381 more debtors’ balances, add
£55,830 to premises and £83,160 to plant

For over a decade war and post-war in-
flationary influences have been steadily
forcing up the national income, wages,
prices and costs. At the same time
scarcities, rationing and price control have
taken the edge off competition and, com-
pared with before the war, reduced the
sales effort needed to turn goods into
cash. The resultant growth in retail turn-
overs is illustrated in the next table, which
shows changes in aggregate sales of a
dozen Brisbane department stores com-
pared with corresponding periods of the
previous year:

Official policy has been, roughly, to main-
tain gross cash margins. Although gross
percentage margins have tended to narrow
as prices rose, and costs have persistently
gobbled more of each year’s takings, ex-
panding turnover has thus far worked
the trick so far as net earnings are con-
cerned.
Finney’s store is in the centre of one
of the busiest blocks in the city, and the
co. enjoys a reputation for shrewd buying
and careful administration. Last term
gross earnings (£405,091) stepped up
£18,714, and the net result (£83,377) bene-
fited by £9375 of the gain. The allowance
for taxation and contingencies (£75,095)
was £17,523 lighter, thanks largely to
abolition of War-time (Co.) Tax. The
profit was 20.7 p.c. on capital as against
18.4, 19.4, 16.6, 16.5 and 12.6 p.c. back
to 1943. The cautious board kept the
div. at 10 p.c., sent £5OOO to the staff
fund, and ploughed £38,171 back into
the business. That lifted reserves to
within £34,572 of paid capital, which
means that the two combined need net
only 5.2 p.c. to show 10 p.c. on capital
alone.
The co. trades largely on a cash basis:

Investments and

The year’s net additions of £15,379 to
property and plant and of £23,504 to
stocks were partly on account of the new
store at the comer of Queen and Edward
streets —it used to be the old Courier
building—which the co. bought a year
or so ago, the business having outgrown
its original premises. The improvement
in the more - or - less liquid surplus
(£279,023) was £25,867.
As for the current term, rising prices
following withdrawal of Government sub-
sidies and recurrent wage-lifts might be
expected to exert a limiting influence on
the range and physical volume of sales.
On the other hand the national income
and employment both promise to remain
high, and the unions are asking for yet
another substantial lift in the basic wage.
Sooner or later this process will work its
own cure, and retail turnovers will get
into reverse gear. The effect upon net
earnings will be in inverse ratio, unless
price control is either abandoned or
present policy substantially altered.
The market notes the co.’s strong
points, including the wide margin between
earnings and distributions, and prices the
f.-p. pound ords, at 475. as against 435.
6d. a year back. The return at 475. is
4-2 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis. On the
same basis the 55.-paid contribs. would
return 5.6 p.c. when fully-paid. But no
hint is given as to when the remaining
15s. is likely to be asked for. Including
uncalled capital (£50,057), the cover is
365. 3d. in net tangibles,

An impressive point about this holding
co.’s latest profit (representing 14.6 p.c.
on mean capital) is that it includes no
contribution from the forge subsidiary,
which has become the biggest John Mc-
Grath interest. Australian Forge and
Engineering Pty. recently had £250,000
paid capital compared with the parent’s
£300,000 ; the parent has since issued an-
other £lOO,OOO of which the Forge co. is
expected to absorb a large share. Situated
at Lidcombe (N.S.W.), this subsidiary has
been signed up to make most forgings
for the new Holden car; the customary
teething troubles caused a small net loss
last term, but production is now in better
stride and on a paying basis.
John McGrath’s remarkable transfor-
mation since 1940 followed the tempo-
rary cutting off of supplies of Hillman
and Humber cars —at that time the N. S.
Wales-Queensland franchise for these
was the co.’s main breadwinner. The
board reacted by turning its small manu-
facturing interests to defence work and
rapidly developing them.
Car franchises are now handled by a
second subsidiary, John McGrath’ Pty.
(paid capital £60,000), and three other
proprietaries complete the family. Distri-
buting British and American steel and
engineering products throughout the
eastern and southern States is Perkins

Nominal capital has just been lifted from
£400,000 to £1,000,000. Another issue
will be necessary, says the chairman, if
“the buoyant state” of the subsidiaries
continues to require working capital on
the current scale.
Of the latest dividend, 2 p.c. has been
labelled bonus. The £47,413 net profit
was declared after substantial deprecia-
tion of £32,369 (up £11,081), but tax pro-
visions aren’t stated. Many of the Perkins
agencies for U.S. products will probably
continue to be limited by the dollar posi-
tion this term ; Humber-Hillman supplies
are likely to be better, though the market
will be more competitive ; but the parent’s
showing will be principally determined
by the performance of the Forge sub-
sidiary, which in turn will largely depend
on the availability of fuel, power,, and
steel.
The co.’s £1 shares (all ordinary), to
which attention was drawn here 12
months ago when priced at 435., now
fetch about 555. Yield at that figure is
4.4 p.c. on the basis of last div., and the

Average net earnings of this old-estab-
lished catering business —it has 40
branches in and around Sydney—was
£34,384 for the four years to end June,
1939, and £18,945 for the eight years
after that. The figure shrunk to £10,036
for the 12 months covered by the latest
accounts, or 3.3 p.c. on capital as against
6,6, 6.1, 6.6, 6.1 and 4.5 p.c. back to
1942. The board kept the div. at 6 p.c.;
a suggestion that it is hopeful of recover-
ing some or all of the lost ground during
the current term.
Average distribution over the last eight
years was 5.9 p.c., and for the five years
before that 9 p.c. And, according to the
canons of sound finance, last term’s
£10,036 was not earned. No allowance
was made for depreciation, for which
purpose’£ls,o43 was set aside during the
previous term; and there is nothing in
the published accounts to show that any
provision was made for taxation either
—£4513 overprovided on account of
War-time (Co.) Tax in the previous term
was written back to p. and 1. account.
In these days of inflation and heavy co.
taxation the question of depreciation has
assumed a new importance.
The co.’s troubles were legion. The
year’s outgoings were bumped up by
£28,000 on account of wage increases and
the 40-hour week, and by £21,000 be-
cause of commodity price rises. Trading
was affected by gas and electricity ration-
ing, transport problems, irregular milk

All these things and the disas-

in selling charges combined to
severely repress net earnings,

lowing an overhaul of the or-

CENTRAL NORSEMAN
GOLD CORPORATION, N.L.
Extracts from the Address of the Chairman, Sir Walter
Massy-Greene, delivered at the Annua] General Meeting
of Shareholders of Central Norseman Gold Corporation,
N.L., held at Melbourne on Thursday, 12th Aug., 1948.
After dealing with the operations of the
Company the Chairman said: The mill
output may be slightly below 10,000 tons
during the next few months, pending de-
livery of items of plant for the crushing
section. Until the new main shaft is
available for mining the new ore shoots
the mill feed will come mainly from
stopes above the No. 20 level, some of
which are approaching exhaustion, and the
grade will consequently be below the
average of the reserves. Some reduction
in costs may be expected when the new
shaft is operating due to its favourable
position in relation to the new ore shoots.
Plans have been attached to the annual
report for the purpose of drawing atten-
tion to the extent of the company’s hold-
ings, as well as facilitating reference to
reports. The lease plan shows areas and
relative positions of the various leases.
It will be noted that these are spread over
a distance of 10 miles from Lady Miller
in the south to the Princess Royal in the
north, and comprise the major portion of
the producing part of the Norseman field,
New Shell .1 Phoenix Mine.
At the Phoenix Mine the new main
shaft has been sunk to 1200 ft. from the
surface, and is expected to bfcak through
to the Pilot rise from No. 16 level within
a month or so. The Pilot opening is now
completed to just below the No. 26 level,
and will greatly facilitate the completion
of the shaft. The shaft has passed through
two flat dipping reefs separated by about
100 ft. in a direction normal to the dip.
These reefs correspond with shearing and
quartz intersections in various surface
drill holes nearby. The first of the ex-
posures at 600 ft. depth is a well-defined
narrow reef which averaged 27dwt. over
9in. width for the 17ft. exposed. The
second at 1000 ft. appears to be a much
stronger featuro and average 7.ldwt.
over 48in. width for the length of 12ft.
now exposed in the shaft.
These results suggest that the Mararoa
Shear above No. 16 level has split into
separate hanging wall and footwall
channels and has entered a regular en-

Drives Now Back m Values.
At No. 25 level driving both ways cn
quartz reef continued throughout the
period and connected to the south' with
the 6040 N winze, beyond which the drive
is now - advancing. Both north and south
drives passed through poor sections of
the reef associated with relatively north-
west strikes, but each is now back in
values with a change to the more favour-
able strike.
The north drive now at 6858 N has ex-
posed a further 79ft. averaging S.ldwt.
over 48in., and the south drive, at 6020 N
has yielded 163 ft. averaging S.Sdvvt. over
65in., both faces now being in better
grade ore. Overall sampling figures for
the ore exposed at No. 25 level are now
9.sdwt. per ton for a width of 57in. over
a lengfh of 796 ft.
In the north drive near 6750 N the reef
followed a pronounced north-westerly strike
for about 100 ft. of length, and it is now
apparent that at this horizon it will pass
on the western or footwall side of the
New Main Shaft and that a marked
flattening of dip will be required to carry
it back into the H.W. side'in the deeper
levels. The probable existence of such
flattening is now suggested by results in
the pilot winze at 6940 N which has re-
vealed a strong reef entering the winze
from the footwall side at 110 ft. below No.
25 level. Sampling results from the short
length of exposure have been low, but the
holes did not reach the footwall of the
quartz which appears therefore to be wider
than 7ft. at this locality,
Division of Ore Shoots into
Groups
p *
In the annual report the new ore on
the No. 25 level was described as No. 4
group of ore shoots since it is the fourth
group successively going northwards along
Die Mararoa shear. The southerly, or No.
1 group were those worked in the property
adjoining the leases to the south. The
next, or No. 2, group are those ore
shoots shown on the plan which lie
broadly above and to the south from a
hue drawn from No. 16 plat on the
Phoenix Shaft to the north end of No. 6
level. The No. 3 group are those ma-
mediately below and to the north of that

reflects the geology of the gold deposition,
the areas containing the gold shoots being
believed to be those where the shear is
crossing successive drag folds in a par-
ticular favourable bed in the green-
stone. As the dragfolding is known to
continue northwards and the shear also as
far as we have any observations, it is
not unreasonable to expect the gold shoots
also to continue. The hatching on the
plan of the Mararoa vein shows Hie gold-
hairing shoots, the quartz being more
widely spread throughout the shear,

relationship of the various ore shoots
exposed in this mine can be determined,

Major Industry
How the chairman of B.H.P.
explained the bottleneck in coal
and steel as it affected Australia’s
biggest industrial undertaking:
The installed capacity at Newcastle
and Port Kembla steelworks for the
production of steel ingots is 1,750,000
tons annually. Unfortunately, output
for each of the past three years has
been substantially below that level;
production for the year ended May
'3l, 1948, being 1,308,410 tons.
Regular and adequate supplies of
coal and additional labor would have
made it possible to produce an ad-
ditional 34 p.c. of steel ingots and
so contribute towards the alleviation
of the steel shortage, which exists
not only in Australia but throughout
the world. It can be readily visualised
what this extra 440,000 tons of steel
would have meant to the nation in
the hands of the manufacturing in-
dustries and ultimate consumers.
The opportunity to embark upon
export business with other countries
still exists, but because of prevailing
conditions we reluctantly have had
to decline to enter those markets,
except for one or two isolated ship-
ments.
Mr. H. G. Darling added that at
present 84 p.c. of B.H.P. coal
output is mechanically cut and
73 p.c, mechanically lor d-d,
Overall Australian figures \, ere
39 p.c. and 29 p.c. respectively.
Turning from the particular
aspect of coal, Mr. Darling
commented on the manpower,
wages and production position
generally:
There must be a better understand-
ing of the simple truth that every
section of the community has every-
thing to gain by co-operating to pro-
mote the efficiency of the economic
system as a whole. It follows, there-
fore, that one section cannot possibly
gain by efforts to advance its own
interest at the expense of the whole.
The narrow view of keeping the
nation short of coal so that the de-
mands of the coalminers*can be con-
tinually enforced cannot in the end
benefit the miners. This policy can
only bring about stagnation.
During recent times we have seen,
both at home and abroad, that wage-
increases are inevitably followed by
price-increases, and the only lasting
result has been the diminution in the.
purchasing-power of currency and the
devaluation of savings. In the in-
terests of employees, shareholders arid
the community generally, I sincerely
hope that this destructive inflationary
movement will soon be arrested, as it
can be by increased production.
Some idea of the trend of wages
at our Newcastle steelworks may
be gained when I tell you that
whereas the average weekly earnings
of all employees increased by 22.28
p.c. between 1939 and 1945, the aver-
age wage at the present time is 60.53
p.c. higher than in 1939. This figure
does not include the effect of the
reduction in the number of working
hours per week.
With the shorter working week and
the expansion of industrial activity,
it is quite understandable that fac-
tory employment throughout the
Commonwealth should now be at a
record high. A high level of employ-
ment, however, means very little unless
it is accompanied by a greater or
at least a corresponding increase in
production.
The 40-hour week at this stage of
our national development has added
to the acuteness of the labor position
.and the difficulty of maintaining the
necessary numerical strength for
normal operations, let alone new de-
velopments. Moreover, the problem
has been accentuated by the heavy
turnover of labor, in itself a serious
and costly matter.
The introduction of the 40-hour
week has added considerably to the
cost and shortage of gbods and ser-
vices and is a big factor in further
increasing the inflationary trend, and
in time will seriously affect our
primary as well as secondary pro-
duction.
B.H.P. is a profit-making enter-
prise which has done more for
the advancement of the • Aus-
tralian economy than all its
“Labor”-party detractors have
ever done. The words of its
chairman deserve to be noted
well by all Australians, especially
trade-unionists, and regardless
of what their own particular
petty grouch might be against
the present order of things. This
country will be ruined unless we
restore ample productivity, and
in order to do that it looks as
though we will have to deal
effectively with both Chifleyism
and Communism.
The Sharemarket
The prices of Australian in-
vestment shares had a short
period of weakness last week,
following New York to a certain
extent, which was perhaps influ-
enced by the possibility of war
with Russia. The world is sick
of war, but there is no reason to
believe that equity shares would
suffer, during another war, any
more than holdings of cash,
bank deposits. Government
securities, etc. Land, house-
property, ordinary shares in in-
dustrial companies, merchandise
stocks, etc., have shown that
they withstand * inflation better
than paper-money investments.
As has been said here for
many years, a -war-time
economy, where not allied to
socialism, is not usually the kind
which makes the value of paper
money higher in relation to
equity shares—in other words,
it does not produce conditions
warranting a fall in share prices.
Our paper money of today has
not the gold value which it once
possessed, and suffers heavily
from Government-created infla-
tion in the process of financing
war’s cost.
Viewed from the aspect of
present internal industrial and
financial conditions, it is true
that the outlook for most busi-
ness enterprises is mixed. There
is a scarcity of labor, and wages
are rising steeply, with further
increases in prospect as the
abolition of Federal price-subsi-
dies has its effect on the basic
wage over the next few months.
Then there is the snowballing
costs influence of the ill-judged
40-hour week. On top of this,
coal is short, and so are many
raw and semi-manufactured
materials. It is hard to get any
smoothness in the running of an
industry today, it being the de-
liberate intention of the Com-
munists and “militants” to create
as much industrial creaking and
straining as possible.
Price-control is already subject
to relaxation in respect of com-
modities declared unessential,
and the tendency in future
should be towards more decon-
trol. This may provide greater
scope for industrial operations,
with a removal of some of the
restrictions which have in the
past slowed down enterprise and
initiative. Decontrol may lead
to isolated and temporary
abuses, but a return to competi-
tive production must be the aim
of all efficient and vigorous man-
agements. The trend towards
decontrol is all to the ultimate
good.
On the score of tax relief, there
is no sign of improvement in the
company field. Abolition of
War-time (Company) Tax has
been the only concession made
to investment companies, and its
benefit has been erratically dis-
tributed. The taxation burden
is still a very big obstacle to im-
proving company earnings.
Socialistic planning by Can-
berra “Labor” has suffered a
number of political reverses, and
private enterprise has brighter
prospects, on the political side,
than for several years. But pro-
duction on a larger, more ade-
quate scale will bring the
greatest real prosperity to in-
dustry as a whole. The defeat
of socialism and the removal of
industrial 'bottlenecks is the kind
of news the industrial share-
market should be looking for-
ward to in the future.

LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
Class-conscious Congress
The general public, after three
years of Labor government, has
become resigned to the lack of
anything constructive in the
speeches of delegates of the
“movement” at one or other of
its conferences. To the respon-
sible citizen, who looks with
eagerness for any positive signs
of progression, the 80th Trades-
Union Congress, held recently at
Margate, was no more realistic
than the rest of them.
After the Primate’s address,
in which he said that never had
the unions held so much power,
political and economic, as at
present, and that never was the
possession of power more
dangerous, the immediate re-
action was to look for evidence
of responsibility. It was not to
be found. The dominant char-
acteristic was sectional interest,
The diehard doctrinaire not
only tends to become so
absorbed in theories that he can’t
—or won’t—face facts, but he
also believes that the world is
for him and for the like of him.
It is he who creates class-con-
sciousness and makes sure that
he keeps it alive. The impres-
sion gained from the Congress
was that no one was considered
to matter except the trade-
unionist. Outside a few resolu-
tions framed by the larger
unions and one which dealt with
the training of members for new
responsibilities, the rest seemed
petty, selfish and irresponsible ;
and some were markedly Com-
munistic in flavor.
Miss Florence Hancock,
president of the T.U.C., cleared
the air, if nothing more, by
condemning “active mischief-
makers.” “We are well aware,”
she said, “that there exists in
this country, as in many others,
an organisation which tries by
every means to provoke indus-
trial troubles.” The more
direct admission —that Com-
munists were behind the strikes
—might have sounded better, at
least to non-union members. But
no doubt the president, bearing
in mind her audience, had to
consider her words carefully.
Meanwhile there is no evidence
that the mischief-makers have
been removed, or that the huge
bureaucratic machines have won
back the respect and confidence
of their remote rank and file.
Cripps
However frankly and soberly
the Chancellor of the Exchequer
expressed the state of the
nation’s economy, with his ad-
mission that wages could not be
raised by cutting profits, that
one section of people could have
a large slice of cake only at the
expense of others, that new
methods and new machinery
were preferable to longer hours,
the nation’s recovery would seem
still to depend upon harder work
and lower costs. Informed
realists are constantly pointing
out that we are not working
hard enough, particularly in
coalmining and in the building
trades. And the high price of
coal since nationalisation (signi-
ficantly overlooked by the Con-
gress) has itself been the chief
cause of higher living costs. So
more wage claims are pressed.
More prices rise. And more
wage claims...
The National Union of Manu-
factures, representing more than
5000 British manufacturers and
50 trade concerns, has endorsed
the Chancellor’s appeal for in-
creased production. It has, in
fact, been pleading with the
Government for the past two
years to talk less and do more,
by setting an example in cutting
down expenditure and reducing
the large staffs in central and
local government. With these
economies, it is argued that the
present penal rate of taxation
of 9s. in the £ might be reduced
so that reserves for replacements
could be built up.
The National Union also calls
for no further shortening of the
working week and, in some
cases, for longer hours. Finally,
it emphasises that every possible
incentive must be given to em-
ployees.
While the future of the nation
lies in the efficiency of its in-
dustry, a hard-headed approach
to the problems of productivity
may be too simple a solution to
commend itself to the theorists
of Transport House. Perhaps
that is why brother Shinwell,
temporarily seconded from the
War Ministry as a fraternal
delegate, was so concerned about
the 1950 general election,
A realistic policy, directed by
practical, business-minded men,
might then save the polling-day
and, ultimately, the nation. But
it isn’t expected to come from
the Left.
The “Proms”
If, 21 years ago, the 8.8. C.
saved the Promenade Concerts
from extinction, there havevbeen
no signs in recent years-’ that
their success depends substanti-
ally upon wireless relays. Seats
in this 54th season have been
hard to get, and queues for ad-
mission have been longer. The
series is as well-established in
character and seasonal regularity
to the London scene as a
November “particular” or the
Trooping of the Color.
From stage and platform as
well as in private, wits have long
made fair —and often unfair —
game of the Albert Hall, which
is a good substitute for the
bumt-out Queen’s Hall only in
capacity. Appearing to be
bigger from the inside than from
the outside, the Albert Hall
seems to typify many of the less
admirable characteristics of its
age. It is mighty and yet
trivial, ornate and smug. Sim-
plicity and directness are lost
in a profusion of tasteless detail.
Unlike the Queen’s Hall, which
made the chamber ensemble and
the grand orchestra feel equally
at home, the Albert Hall belies
intimacy. A Mozart Diverti-
mento has a naked incongruity,
like a clavichord in a super-
cinema.
There have been changes.
Man’s ingenuity still strives to
lay the notorious echo. The
protrusion that extends over the
heads of the orchestra like the
neb of a surrealistic cap has
been modified; and the sections
of the orchestra have been
boldly uprooted and rearranged.
It has been pointed out that the
result is nothing new but merely
reverts to a seating that was
used in the time of J. S. Bach.
But the echo has popped up
again—in another part of the
building. There’s plenty of
room for it.
Notwithstanding the strictures
of England’s most celebrated
conductor, the general public is
cheerfully defiant and chooses to
spend its money on hearing
what it wants —the more popular
works of Beethoven and
Tschaikowsky. While Wagner,
no doubt, with good reason, has
declined in popularity, the Bach
nights have been crowded.
Promenaders seemed noticeably
young, with rather more men
among them then women. As
every actor knows, to stand quite
still for long periods is a con-
siderable physical strain. Audi-
ences have proved to be more
discerning and less wildly accla-
matory than in pre-war years.
Performances have been good,
with a consistently high standard.
The two orchestras that shared
the eight-week season seemed
virile and fresh even towards
the end of their terms. Again,
the average age is much younger
than it was.
However much the more
precious type of intellectual may
sneer, there can be no doubt of
the value of the “Proms,” both
as an event and as a contribu-
tion to the musical life of the
Metropolis—and that ignores
the vast number of radio listeners
at home and oversea. A glance
at the repertoire shows the
astonishing compression into
eight weeks of works that cover
all tastes from the mildly inquisi-
tive to the choosy connoisseur.
And to the many music-lovers
whose leisure is scant the oppor-
tunity for aural refreshment is
without parallel.

FLOWER SHOW.
At about this time of the year
in Westralia the wildflowers are
out, Down around Busselton,
for instance, the Roaring Forties
have subsided or moved south,
the big brown Toos are showing
new coats, and along the
road through Dunsborough to
Cape Naturaliste the arum-
lilies run wild like patches of
snow under the gums. Wattle,
red-and-green kangaroo - paws,
brown-and-gold donkey orchids,
white-and-yellow spider orchids,
“blood orchids,” blue orchids,
and flannel-flowers grow by the
roadside, and the fragile insec-
tivorous sundew or rainbow-
fern climbs in a glistening
tangle through the bushes.
These pleasant recollections
were stirred by a visit to the
Red Cross’s “Flower Festival”
on a stray summer day last
week. The show —thd fourth —
is an annual event which
promises to become an institu-
tion, and well it might. On Syd-
ney Domain, and bounded by
the National Art Gallery, the
Botanic Gardens, the Mitchell
Library, Parliament House and
Sydney Hospital, it couldn’t
have a better setting for its 27
flower - filled marquees and
smaller tents and open beds of
flowers blazing with color.
Flowers have been flown from
San Francisco, Honolulu, Suva,
New Zealand and, of course, all
the Australian States. Most of
the abovementioned wildflowers
are on display as well as the
beautiful, pastel waxlike Qualup
bell, smokebush, everlastings,
crimson and sky-blue lesche-
naultia, wild primroses, desert-
peas, “Coolgardie rose” (this
specimen grown in Broken Hill),
and others.
Seeking information after
wandering through a profusion
•of daffodils, cyclamen, Iceland
poppies, larkspurs, carnations,
sweet-peas, gerberas, ranunculi,
snapdragons and a whole mar-
quee filled with large, motion-
less orchids —we were recom-
mended to G. Tony Ekblade,
whom we found among the wild-
flowers, where he was directing
the installation of lights, holding
a ladder for the electrician and
advising an inquirer that kanga-
roo-paws would grow from
seeds labelled Anigozanthos
manglesii, incredible as that may
seem.
Ekblade, lean and softly
spoken, with close-cropped iron-
grey hair and a mildly humorous
gaze, moved through the wild-
flowers with a kind of gentle
precision explaining where each
had come from and how it could
be grown. Pressed for informa-
tion about his part in the display,
he mentioned every name he
could think of but his own.
Pressed further, he admitted to
having bought land at Clifton
Gardens 15 years ago and set out
to convert it to a natural garden
by planting flowering-gums,
Christmas-bush, Illawarra flame-
tree, bottlebrush, chorezema
and many other Australian
flowers. Under further pressure,
he disclosed that he was a Swede
who “more-or-less ran away to
sea” in sailing ships and rounded
the Horn in a three-masted
barque before he was 18. After
seeing Egypt, Germany, Finland,
Denmark, Russia and other
places, he visited Australia in
1906 and, liking it, returned for
good in 1908 and set up in a
small confectionery business.
Subsequently, travelling all
over Australia from north
Queensland to Western Aus-
tralia by car —35,000 miles in
18 months on one occasion—he
made the acquaintance of Aus-
tralian wildflowers and decided
to grow them in his own garden.
“Travelling all over Australia
by car” seemed a lot of travel-
ling for a “small confectionery
business,” and under a final
burst of cross-questioning Ek-
blade admitted to having sold
his own business long ago and
having joined the Wrigley chew-
ing-gum concern, of which he is
now the Australian manager.
Just at this moment Mr. J.
Johnston joined the conversa-
tion with a cardboard box con-
taining some “mint bush” which,
he said,, “a lady from Grenfell
has sent us.” The conversation
rose to botanic level—“Ovali-
folia; if the plant had been
starved the leaves would be
about that size” —and we tact-
fully withdrew, having first
ascertained that Mr. Johnston
was not, as we suspected, a
Latin scholar or a professional
horticulturist but a metallurgist.
In search of further informa-
tion we fought through several
thousand people, daffodils and
potplants to Mr. John D.
Thomas, whose normal occupa-
tion is administrative legal work
in the Bank of N. S. Wales, but
who has been lent by the bank
as one of the joint honorary
organisers of the flower show—
Matt Nowland, who runs a
dahlia nursery at Thornleigh, is
the other half of the “joint.” Mr.
Thomas was in the process of
making up a time-sheet—
“£4 12s. 2d. for Sunday;
£3 6s. 2d. for Saturday and
£1 15s. a day for the rest of the
week ; that’s £l6 13s. 4d. for a
seven-day week.” The gentleman
who collected the boodle, we
discovered, was one of 12 casual
workers employed for the show
■Mhe remaining 400 workers are
volunteers.
By this time we were at the
head of a long queue waiting to
see Mr. Thomas, so we with-
drew to one side to observe
what went on. In the npxt 10
minutes he dealt with a dozen
or more people and such varied
things as taxation-sheets, de-
pendants’ forms, biscuits for a
stall, a utility to get them,
tickets for another stall, a re-
quest for lost property over the
public-address system, raffle-
tickets for another department,
something with which to water
the orchids, a donation to the
Red Cross and “somewhere to
feed the baby.” He then found
time —between gulping a cup of
tea and rolling a cigarette and
allotting the maypole-dancers a
tent in which to undress —to ex-
plain that organising the show
entailed lining -up with the
health authorities for the instal-
lation of sewerage, dishwashing
machines, hot-water storage-
tanks, sinks, boilers, etc.;
arranging transport for all the
exhibits; setting up the mar-
quees and stalls; organising
catering arrangements; manag-
ing the business set-up and
cleaning up when the show is
over, as well as dealing with
hundreds of inquirers.
Fearing that Mr. Thomas
might list us among the most
pestiferous of the inquirers, we
departed to wander through the
flowers again and out into the
Domain with the stream of
people on their way home carry-
ing bunches of leschenaultia,
smoke - bush, wild Australian
orchids and, of course, Anigo-
zanthos manglesii.
Royal Art Society.
A sea-piece by Lance Solo-
mon, a flowerpiece by Hanke,
several paintings of the bush by
Howard Ashton and, in the
watercolors, a piecs of glisten-
ing but nevertheless sombre
road by G. K. Townshend stand
out at the Royal Art Society’s
exhibition at the Education De-
partment Gallery, Sydney. They
are highly favorable indications
of what the society can do.
Other paintings, as representa-
tive, err a little on the side of
dullness, and most of all in what
may be called facile romanti-
cism—the assembly of thick and
bright paint in an incomplete
image of beauty or drama.
With full account taken of
the weak paintings in the exhi-
bition, the show as a whole is of
a high standard. Dargie’s por-
trait of an “Irish Girl” (bought
by the N. S. Wales Gallery) is
a solid but slightly disappointing
piece of wqrk. It has charm and
character, but on close inspec-
tion it shows rough edges of
technique—the mouth, for in-
stance, has the rigid appearance
of a careful application of lip-
stick —and the picture is inferior
to Dargie’s best work and lack-
ing in the “grand style” of Lam-
bert.
Garrett Kingsley has a nude,
pleasant and accomplished, but
a little cold and deficient in
something—color, passion or
majesty which would give
dramatic content, Kingsley and
Leonard Long both have land-
scapes of charm and promise.
Besides his enormous
“Gladioli,” Hanke’s “Green
Pastures, Kangaroo Valley,” a
quiet scene of willows, a stream
and a cow, is remarkable for its
richness in a small compass.
Howard Ashton’s “Bent Tree”
is, within its limits, a fine piece
of observation with a thin strain
of poetry in it. His several large
pictures, with a pattern of blue,
windswept skies, clear white
puffs of clouds and landscape
sparkling under sunshine have a
distinctive style and a clear,
hard excellence.
Strasser’s portrait of a Balinese
girl has charm and character
and color —perhaps too much
color of a uniform kind in the
background. The composition is
ugly, but the painting is one of
the best in the exhibition,
Salvana, Bell, Veal and Dow-
man are others who are well
represented.
Gafni.
The young Hungarian threw
all the opulence of his robust
tenor into the operatic lists at
his second Sydney recital. ■ His
flair for extracting the maximum
of sensuousness from an aria
gained point from his handling
of “E lucevan le stelle,” from
“Tosca,” and where the voice
rose in passages of tragical im-
port he gave it suitable depth as
well as just plain power. The
beautiful romanza, “Una Fur-
tiva Lagrima,” from Donizetti’s
“Elixir of Love,” was finely
phrased, and the “Vesti la
Giubba,” from “Pagliacci,” was
sung with more than sufficient
passion.
Gafni’s English has improved
quickly. He has graduated from
the “No-wose-in-oil-the-voild-
ondil-you-gom” standard which
characterised his efforts in the
Anglo-Saxon tongue last year.
This time his English enuncia-
tion in such songs as “For You
Alone,” Oscar Walters’s “My
Love Song to a Tree” and “Be-
cause” was admirably clear. In
such Italianate trippings as
Tosti’s “Marechiare” and Ros-
sini’s “La Danza” the tenor sang
at around 150 w.p.m, as to the
manner born.

crepe romaine was worn with a hip-
length brilliant-red jacket which glittered
with gold sequins. Mrs. H. R. Hamer’s
white satin gown was patterned in pastel-
blue feather design; her wrap was of
dyed ermine. Mrs. Hylton Dale’s pink
and silver lame gown was worn with a
short matching jacket which had an up-
standing ruffled neckline. Patricia Schur-
mann’s rose-pink taffeta gown was ankle-
length and featured the new harem skirt.
Mary Tait’s blue - and - silver - brocade
gown had a wide farthingale skirt. Over
her slim black gown Mrs. Frank Tait
wore a short lime-green velvet cloak.
Tall, slim Mrs. Bill Cook wore a black
dinner gown under a mink coat. A gown
of black velvet with a padded hipline and
full corded skirt was worn by Mrs.
Myer Sutherland under a mink coat, Mrs.
Bill McDermott’s choice was white crepes
and silver-fox furs.
Among the smartly-suited at Moonee
Valley on Saturday was the Lady
Mayoress, Mrs. J. S. Disney, whose hip-
length jacket with its unusual pocket-flaps
was worn over a black barathea suit;
her small black hat was finished with
veiling sprinkled with tiny pink roses.
Lady Wales’s black suit was pencil-striped
in white, and her hat of cyclamen-straw
finished with matching satin ribbons.
Mrs. S. Fletcher, wife of the American
Consul-General, chose a frock of parma-
violet and contrasted it with black coat
and small feather-trimmed‘black hat. Mrs.
William. Seymour’s gold-toned felt hat
trimmed with matching ribbon bows set
off nicely her grey suit. Mrs. Michael
Clarke’s rust felt hat, which was worn
with a rust suit, had sbft feathers in
beige tonings. Lady Clarke’s light royal-
blue suit was worn with a small white
straw hat. Brown panels were in the
jacket of Mrs. David Knox’s beige suit;
her accessories were London tan.
Mrs. A. E. Drakeford’s grey tailored
suit was edged with a lighter grey silk;
her sage-green hat had matching feather
trimming. Sonia O’Brien set off her
dusty-pink angora suit with a brown silk
straw hat and brown accessories. Loris
Nettleburg’s red-and-white-candy-striped
taffeta hat was worn with a junior navy
jacket suit. Joan Smallhorn teamed a
beige frock, hip-length navy jacket and
navy-and-white-spotted hat. Mrs. C.
Day’s choice was a black frock swathed
at the hips with black moire taffeta and
slit at the centre seam to show a ruffled
petticoat; her large hat of toast-straw
was finished with flat black velvet bows.
The Matthew Lang Cellars was the
setting for another of the popular parties
given by James and Janet Bowen Pain, this
one to celebrate Janet’s birthday. The hos-
tess chose a simple Quaker-grey wool
jacket-suit with touches of white at the
neck and sleeves; her small hat was
of white chip straw. Mrs, Reg Mowat,
of Sydney, wore a ballerina jacket-suit of
black moire taffetas with a small black
osprey-trimmed hat. Mrs. Martin Wang
chose one of her national costumes; it
was of pastel-blue satin patterned in a
scroll design of blue and pastel-pink. A
grey wool jacket-suit and small flower-hat
made neat combination for Mrs. Crosbie
Hucks. Lilianne Gay’s navy-and-white-
patterned frock was worn with a large
white hat. Ballet-dancers patterned the
gold-toned crepe frock worn by Ivy
Parker under her black coat; her large
hat was of gold straw. Mrs. George Max-
well covered her navy-and-white frock
with a hip-length box jacket; her large
navy hat was trimmed with satin ribbon.
Bows outlined the neckline of the black
frock worn by Mrs. Bill Cook, and match-
ing bows trimmed her large black straw
hat. Cyclamen bows embellished the hat
which Mrs, Colin Baldwin added to her
periwinkle-blue wool jacket-suit. Mrs.
J. R. Burt tied her beige straw bonnet with
brown veiling and wore a beige crepe
jacket-suit. .
An s.o.s. this week from Vivienne Betty
Stephens, organising secretary of the
Royal Melbourne Hospital. It is Egg
Appeal month, and the hospital will be
glad to receive all it can get. They may
be railed to Spencer-street or Flinders-
street stations, and the hospital will
gladly pay the freight. If cases are
needed, application to the auxiliary or-
ganiser at the hospital will hurry them
along.
Mrs. Audrey Elford, organising, secre-
tary of the Children’s Hospital, also adds
her plea. She hopes soon to open.an
Opportunity Stall in the Outpatients
Department, and to do this she will re-
quire a considerable quantity of used or
new clothing. Mrs. Elford will also be
grateful for hats ami flowers and trim-
mings suitable for remodelling hats. In
fact, she wants everything that has a
selling value; but not shoes. All dona-
tions can be delivered direct to the hos-
pital. Telephone number is FJ3171 ;
Mrs. Elford’s home number, U 3795.
For her marriage to Bryan Douglas
Austin at St. John’s, Toorak, Jennifer,
elder daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Andrew
Chimside, of Moorallah, Carranballoc,
wore a gown of pearl-tinted poult de sole.
The tight-fitting bodice had a deep square
neckline and long, tight sleeves, outlining
the neckline ; and at the wrists was a de-
sign of hearts and orange-blossom tied with
true-lovers’ knots, embroidered in pearls
and crystal beads. The skirt was flowing
and trained. A family veil of lovely rose-
point lace was mounted on tulle, arranged
with a point over the forehead and held
with tiny sprays of orange-blossom at
each side. Her bouquet was of palest-
pink orchids. The five bridesmaids, Jane
Chirnside, Peggy and Pat Austin, Rose-
mary Grimwade and Miranda Casey, were
frocked alike in russet-toned French tulle
over tulip-pink taffeta, made with bouffant
skirts and shirred bodices with softly-
draped bertha collars edged with
opalescent sequins which also trimmed
their narrow belts. Their long matching
mittens were also trimmed with sequins.
Half-circlets of deep-pink tulips were
worn at the back of the head and match-
ing tulips formed the bouquets. Bryan,
who is the only son of Mr. Tom Austin,
of Wanganella, Deniliquin (N.S.W.), and
the late Mrs. Austin, had Peter Grimwade
as best man and Richard Outhwaite,
Ronald Baillieu ? Derek Austin and David
Burns as groomsmen.
The reception was held at Menzies.
Mrs. Chirnside’s hat of cream feathers
had a large bow of brown taffeta at the
back and a swathing of cream-and-brown
tulle tied under her chin. Her dove-grey
frock featured a slim-fitting skirt, the
bodice being embellished with tiny gold
sequins. Mrs. Gordon Chirnside wore a
silk Paisley jacket-suit patterned with
brown and cream; her lime-green straw
hat had long-stemmed flowers set on the
wide brim. With Sir Edmund Herring
was Lady Herring, smart in a navy- and
aqua-blue ensemble. Mrs. Peter Grim-
wade’s pink-and-black-patterned frock
was worn under a black coat and with a
pastel-pink coarse-straw hat upturned in
front. Mrs. S. Mackinnon added a plum-
toned wool crepe coat to a frock richly-
patterned in plum and white tonings and
a small silk-straw hat. Black frock and
wide-brimmed silk-straw hat trimmed
with a diamond ornament were Mrs.
George Armstrong’s choice. Guests from
Deniliquin included Mr. and Mrs. Tom
Millear and their daughter Ann, Mr. and
Mrs. Theo McCaw, Mr. and Mrs. Gordon
MacArthur and Mr. and Mrs. G. Gatacre.
A pre-wedding party for Maree Ray-
mond, who will marry John Alderson at
Wesley Church on October 26, was held
at Menzies. Hostess was Mrs. George
Haines, smart in bottle-green corduroy
velvet and pink felt hat trimmed with
pastel-pink and green flowers. Maree’s
navy-and-white-checked taffeta frock was
worn under a navy coat and with a small
ribbon-trimmed hat. Her mother, Mrs.
R. N. Raymond, wore black braided
frock, dyed-ermine jacket and small rose-
trimmed black hat. Adelaide visitor, Mrs.
Ross Stephens, had bows of black velvet
clustered on her black hat, which was
worn with a black ballerina frock and
brown-fox cape. Phyllis Hare added to
her pink-and-navy-patterned frock a
matching pink hat swathed with black
veiling. Caramel-toned corduroy velvet
fashioned the tailored coat worn by Ivy
Parker with her winter-white felt hat
edged and banded with brown grosgrain.
From Sydney
Spring answered her cue and stepped
blithely on to the scene last Wednesday,
and the success of the Flower Festival in
the Domain was assured. Sun and soft
breeze, just enough to set the camphor-
laurels tossing the green feathers of their
young leaves, scampered through the day.
During the morning, long before the
opening hour of three, Red Cross
workers and enthusiasts were making for
the Domain. Here were all the flowers
of the season glowing in garden plots or
jars. Here were primrose and cowslip
and the more aloof orchid, often against
richly-veined variegated foliage. And
among the last none was more looked
on than the small pineapple just within
the entrance.
But, truth to tell, there were too many
tents. At first glance it suggested more a
jousting ground of chivalry than a flower-
festival. Actually you went inside the tents
to view much of the horticulture. Then
probably the lights weren’t working, and
the crowds blacked out the opening sides
so that the delicate hues of our native
flowers had a rather pallid air. But how
our native flowers from the West, from
Queensland, Broken Hill, clutch the
imagination with their, fragile loveliness!
The Viking Ship outside the Norwegian
tent carried a cargo of flowers in spite
of its awe-inspiring figurehead—a fero-
cious sea-dragon. Altogether made of
flower petals was the figure of a woman
on the Belgian stand, and above the
pavilions on the small lawn where France
displayed flowers and ceramics a cock in
bright tricolor plumage challenged the
world.
It was matey, too, to hear his Excel-
lency, Lieut.-General Northcott (no.t look-
ing a day older though his daughter, Mrs.
Donald Coburn, has presented him with
a granddaughter), declare the festival
open, and still later on to wander about
amid the growing shadows of tall trees
meeting all of Sydney.
Mrs. Berryman, her black frock wearing
a Quaker collar of white; Mrs. Jorstad,
wife of Norway’s Minister ; Mrs. Gregory
Blaxland and Barbara Knox with
their flower decorations; the Leslie
Morshead lady, the skirt of her grey
suit softly pleated; the Harry Mox-
ham lady, her suit of summerweight
woollen very much the new look ; Mrs.
George Bell, her creamy coloring mag-
nolia-like against her black frock ; Miss
Nancy Jobson and Miss Wilson ; Mrs.
Persia Porter and Mrs. John Moore in
their Red Cross uniforms; Mrs. George
Duncan, an absolute lure to the R.A.S.
show of flower paintings —these were
among the hundreds making money for
the cause, or just walking about the plea-
sant ways.
Do not forget that next Tuesday night,
October 5, is the date of the Black and
White Ball. The frocks going to this ball
are something out of the box —fresh out
of the box —for the occasion. It will be
a parade of fashion’s last word, pro-
claimed on the persons of Sydney’s best-
dressed, Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere, the
lady in this photograph, is president of
the ball committee. The Industrial Blind
Institution will benefit.
There were schooners in the bar and
yachts on the Harbor when the R.S.Y.S.
at Kirribilli opened its 1948 season, so
everyone was happy, nobody more so
than Martha, the Squadron’s cat; who
basked in the sunshine with approval.
After the wet and stormy weather of the
two preceding days the clear sky was so
welcome people forgot that the atmos-
phere was chill enough to bring
along the seals. But there wasn’t
even a sealskin jacket in view. Some
girls even wore thin silks and cottons, and
left the rest to heaven. The lawns
sprouted here and there a gaudy beach-
umbrella. The band was tucked into a
corner on the lower lawn, and the upper
lawn was crowded with tea-tables. Less
hardy mortals crowded the lounges and
the verandahs;
Guests from across the Harbor arrived
by barge and yacht. Among these were
Admiral H. B. Farncomb and Mrs.
Famcomb. The Brockhoff family came
by yacht, and Mrs. Claude Plowman en-
tertained. aboard the family’s Morna.
The Hamilton Kirklands took the hazard
and sailed across from Point Piper, Mrs.
Kirkland’s shell-pink sports hat with its
stitched brim struck the right note in
millinery. With her was daughter Ruth.
Lieut.-General Berryman was there with
his wife and daughter Anne. Mrs.
Berryman looked trig in black suit and
upswept hat; only touch of white was in
the Peter Pannish collar. Mrs. H. J.
Brady’s white straw beret and soft white
woollen coat propitiated the sun while
defying the wind.
Colonel Spain turned up disguised as
an Admiral. The yachting Furbers were
there, and Mrs. Waterman was in their
party. Nobody smarter than Mrs. Don
Taylor—always very English about her
suits and French in her millinery. Note-
worthy, too, were the two white roses in
Mrs. F, White’s hat. Primrose yellow
was Mrs. Claude Plowman’s frock and
her full-length cape. In her party were
Susan Binney, whose father governs
Tasmania, Mrs. Bertie Kelly, Mrs. Mal-
colm Mackellar, Mrs. G. D. Moore, and
former Consul-General for the Nether-
lands Pennink and Mrs. Pennink. Rear-
Commodore of R.S.Y.S. Hardie and
Mrs. Hardie sailed across to the
party in Windward II; and club’s popular
secretary, J. D. Wilkinson, cruised about
after being moored in hospital for some
weeks.
Pictorial news of the week is, of course,
the Royal Art Society’s show. This is
in the Education Galleries and was
opened last Saturday by Frank Clewlow
to much applause. On Thursday evening
the president and council had opened
the • hearts of Sydney’s art-lovers by a
cocktail party. The recipe for that brew
might be worth getting. Before the pri-
vate view on Friday more than £l4OO-
- of art had been sold. The Gallery
and the Marshall Bequest had bought
some (before the cocktail hour), including
a gem of Erik Langker’s.
Mrs. Erik arrived in Friday’s deluge
very fresh-looking in mint-green. Peter
Lindsay was a notable, his fair hair
bright under the skylight. He looked
embarrassed when somebody told him it
shone like Laurence’ Olivier’s in
“Hamlet.” What a treasure Estelle
Andrews is to the Society! As usual she
kept the door, her genuine pleasantness a
welcome in itself. Dora Toovey was
there, and famed flower-painter Sherman,
Joe Salvana, whose recent show in
Adelaide is still bringing him commissions
by post; and two young art students
hanging on Dargie’s “Irish Girl.”
“Gosh!” muttered the shorter one.
“Doesn’t he make it all look easy?” Big
star on the firmament was art critic
Jimmy MacDonald, over from Mel-
bourne. Noticed, Mrs. Hamilton Kirk-
land’s sapphire-blue turban with its
feather pompon.
The Australian women’s hockey team
which descended on Maoriland and sped
in friendly conquest from Auckland to
Dunedin returned last week. Manager
of the tour, Annis Rees, is'loud in praise
of the welcome given the team. There
were Mayoral receptions everywhere.
Even when their train only called in at
a town on the way from north to south,
there was a group of enthusiastic citizens
there to greet the girls and hustle them
off in the 20 or 30 minutes’ wait between
trains for tea or a motor spin around
the town. The Governor-General enter-
tained them to tea in Wellington ; so did
the Prime Minister at Parliament House.
Then the Mayor spread the welcome mat,
and so did Cutler, V.C., now representing
Australia in the Dominion. But Dunedin,
where the great hockey tournament was
held in Logan Park, is reflected in the
Australians’ memory like an emerald in
the sun. The Australians, too, won all
the matches.
The Girl in the Flat Opposite came
into the Bulletin last Friday, sniffed the
atmosphere, heavy with the smell of
cooking fish from somewhere near by.
“Heavens!” she exclaimed. “They must
be boiling down Jonah’s whale! ”
Three of Brisbane’s successful women
are down in Sydney attending the
national conference of the Business and
Professional Women’s Club. This actu-
ally gets down to business on October
2, and enters on two days of discussion.
The three ladies from the North are Mrs.
Prentice, a barrister, though not practising
at the moment, who is president of her
city’s branch of the club ; Patricia Thoms,
who holds an advertising and news job
(combined) on Queensland “Country
Life”; and Winifred Moore, social
editor of the “Courier-Mail” and a very
enthusiastic person who belongs to
almost every woman’s movement in her
city. The last-named is a fine pianist,
who, in the early days of the war, learned
to play the flute because, as she explained,
“music is always cheering, and you can
take a flute into an air-raid shelter, but
you couldn’t take a grand piano.”

THE SERVICE MAN
War Danger Grows.
“Ek Dum”: The danger of
war is not more apparent than
it was last week, but there is a
new and striking openness now
in the warnings which are being
issued. Till last week everybody
except the Russians adopted a
pose of optimism which was far
from justified by events. But the
finality of the air about the Notes
to Russia, the recall of General
Bedell Smith, the U.S. Am-
bassador to Moscow, “for con-
sultation,” the development of
defence measures, the increasing
interference by the Russians with
the Allied air-lift to Berlin, and
the outbreak of Communist-led
strikes in France would be
enough in themselves to make
the world feel alarmed without
the more ominous developments
and implications. These were
the disappearance of Marshal
Stalin from the scene at a
moment when a conference of
Russian satellite nations is
alleged to be taking place in the
Crimea, the absence of M. Molo-
tov from the U.N.O. Assembly,
and the stepping-up in the power
of Russian long-range radio so
that its shrill female voices, drip-
ping venomous hatred of the
English-speaking peoples, can
fling their poison to the poles.
The dangers of the situation
are not being brought home to
Australia by a section of the
press which had no room to
properly report the important
statements of Mr. Bevin and
General Marshall.
Yet those statements were
specific. Mr. Bevin made it per-
fectly clear that there could be no
settlement of the Berlin dispute
save by the lifting of the block-
ade, that Berlin stood out as the
allied symbol of resistance, that
the Western Powers were in
“absolute agreement,” and were
satisfied that Russia would in-
dulge in many manoeuvres to up-
set Western plans, but that it
was realised that the time had
come to stand firm at any cost.
Mr. Marshall’s statement,
made almost simultaneously, was
just as strong, and the other side
of the question was specifically
put by Nikolai Voznesensky,
Soviet Vice-Premier and a mem-
ber of the Soviet Union Polit-
bureau, which determines Rus-
sian policy, who has said in a
book just published that Stalin
demands “unconditional pro-
Russian orientation” in the Com-
munist parties of the world, that
the Second World War is “only
one of a series,” and that the
next war must inevitably come
before long unless! the United
States backs down on its policies.
All this comes at a time when
U.N.O. Assembly is meeting
under Dr. Evatt’s chairmanship
and again and again voting-down
Russia and its satellite countries,
which have been excluded from
all committee chairmanships and
beaten on moves to exclude Italy
and other countries from mem-
bership despite violent protests
by Mr. Vyshinsky.
The Western Powers decision
to refer the Berlin dispute to the
Security Council for settlement
produces little hope or enthusi-
asm. The proposal may leave
Dr. Evatt with an empty hall, for
there are hints from Moscow
that if any such move is made
the Kremlin will withdraw from
U.N.0., and frank Powers other
than Russia, such as the South
African Government, are begin-
ning to express their doubts
about the utility of that expen-
sive gabbleshop whose quarrel-
ings have done more to produce
a war atmosphere than any other
influence.
The South African delegate,
Mr. Louw —no doubt with
memories in his mind of Dr.
Evatt’s siding with the U.S.S.R.
and Asiatic countries against his
Dominion at an earlier stage—
remarked;
Unless the United Nations changes
the road it has been travelling for the
past two years South Africa may have
to consider whether its membership
is compatible with its national in-
terests.
Meanwhile, in the face of an
admission by the Russians that
they are maintaining their post-
war economy largely as a war
economy “until time determines
whether United States aims have
been thwarted by other means,”
Britain and the United States
are rearming, Britain not so
rapidly as might be because of
her economic difficulties and be-
cause the Attlee Ministry, com-
mitted to a class-war, cannot
achieve the national unity which
was attained under Mr.
Churchill.
Field-Marshal Montgomery,
belying the views attributed to
him last week by Mr. Cyril
Chambers, the Australian Min-
ister for the Army, declares that
a very uneasy peace broods over
the world, and military security
has become very necessary.
The only optimists in Britain
are those cynics who are repeat-
ing the current joke about the
quarrelsome and class-conscious
Mr. Shinwell: “When Mr. Shin-
well was the Minister respon-
sible for coal production, there
was no coal. Now Mr. Shinwell
is Minister for War, there will
be no war.”
And there won’t be unless
British and Dominion defence is
built up rapidly and sufficiently
to the exclusion of lesser needs.
It will be a plain walkover in
Europe. Russia has been pre-
paring for the new war since
1945, and is the only country
likely to be ready at maximum
potential. Russia, also, is obvi-
ously the only country which
courts war.
From Bad to Worse
By the week-end the situation
had become worse and was
marked by a typical attack by
Mr, Vyshinsky on the Western
Powers in U.N.O. Assembly.
It was the same old stuff
which the U.S.S.R. throws out
whenever it intends aggression
—the same sort of stuff which
Moscow flung out against little
Finland, which was accused of
aggressive intentions against
Russia before Russia faked its
clumsy pretext to invade that
tiny country. It was the same
accusation that the British and
Western Powers were preparing
to make war on Russia which
was shouted in the years 1925-
36 when Britain could scarcely
muster a division of troops and
the Navy and Air Force were
moribund.
The Russians at that time were
allowing their country to be
used as a training-ground for
German officers.
It was the same stuff which
was being shrieked over Mos-
cow Radio at the moment when
Stalin had linked himself secretly
to Hitler in 1939, and again the
same old stuff which was issued
in 1940, world-wide, by the
Comintern as part of its anti-
recruiting campaign, to ham-
string Britain and France and
intimidate the United States from
interfering with Germany’s
plans.
It was also the same which
the Australian Communist party
has been propagating ever since
it came into existence and par-
ticularly during the last few
months as part of a plan to put
the responsibility on the victims
of the U.S.S.R. if Russia should
decide to try to overrun Western
Europe. And it was a prelude
to the production of a specious
scheme by the Russian delega-
tion, under which there would
be a general one-third reduction
of armaments and the use of the
atom bomb would be completely
forbidden.
That scheme would have no
practical effect except to secure
proportional decreases for all
nations, plus an additional re-
duction in respect to atomic
energy by the Western Powers.
Next day-Russia-showed its
complete hypocrisy by refusing
to compromise on Berlin. After
the Western Allies had made
concession after concession it
brought forward a new demand,
not made during Marshal Stalin’s
talks with the Western envoys
but suddenly by Marshal Soko-
lovsky in his talks with the
four-Power governors of Berlin,
that Russia should add to the
controls over land and water
transport a further control over
air transport. As this would
mean the complete exclusion of
the Allies from the German capi-
tal, it was vigorously resisted ;
and the strong Notes of last
week having been rejected out of
hand by Moscow, the Western
Powers have decided to refer
the whole matter to U.N.O.
In view of the fact that the
Russian delegate Joseph Malik
has issued the threat that dire
consequences might follow the
discussion of various items be-
fore the Assembly, and especially
the problems of the use of the
veto, which had been the
U.S.S.R.’s exclusive weapon, and
of Korea, Greece and the admis-
sion of Italy and other States to
U.N.0., there seemed to be evi-
dence that the Kremlin and its
satellites had it in mind to walk
out of Dr. Evatt’s rickety and
quarrelsome body, which, on all
questions which matter, is
divided into two clean-cut camps
whenever voting takes place—
the totalitarian Russian bloc
and the Western nations and
South America.
All the world is arming either
for defence or offence. The
Russians as well as the Western
“False alarm—he's given in.”
Powers are holding manoeuvres
—along the Baltic coasts ; and
in course of “exercises” over
Berlin they last week fired a
barrage into the Allied air-corri-
dor.
It needs only a misplaced
shot to bring about the end of
an uneasy peace.
Fleets, Present and
Future.
“Ek Dum”: Last week the
Home Fleet was due to be on
manoeuvres in the English Chan-
nel (September 23-25), prepara-
tory to a training cruise to
South Africa and the West
Indies.
The fleet consists of Duke of
York, battleship, with two
carriers, three cruisers of the
Second Cruiser Squadron and
several destroyers. During the
exercises H.M.S. Illustrious, a
number of submarines and
m.t.bs. were added to help the
exercises, designed to “run-in”
ships which had been lying in
reserve for months and to give
them practice in defence against
underwater and air attack, and
particularly against assault by
small, fast surface vessels, which
have attained a new significance
with the development of rockets
and of some other modern
weapons.
During the latter part of the
exercises it was planned that the
fleet should be divided into two
squadrons, one under the Com-
mander-in-Chief and the other
under Rear-Admiral Russell,
commanding the Cruiser Squad-
ron in H.M.S. Diadem. Shore-
based establishments were or-
ganised to take part under com-
mand of Admiral Sir Robert
Burnett, Commander-in-Chief,
Plymouth, and Air Vice-Marshal
Hopps, commanding No. 19
Group, Plymouth.
Meanwhile there was a great
stirring at Chatham and other
constructional bases, and for the
first time since 1945 naval con-
struction was given first priority,
new vessels began to be pushed
ahead, and there was a general
ominous air of urgency which
suggested a period of peril.
The strength of the fleet, ac-
cording to the plans provided in
the naval estimates, is not very
heartening.
It was planned in March that
there should be two battleships
operational by August-Septem-
ber —Vanguard and Duke of
York. But of these Vanguard
was once more withdrawn, or
on the point of being withdrawn,
for conditioning as a Royal
ferry-ship for the Australian
tour. Anson and Howe, two
King Georges, were relegated to
training and experimental jobs
until April of this year, when
King George V, which was in
reserve, was deputed to relieve
Howe, which was then due for
refit.
Of the heavy fleet-carriers
none was operational early in
the year. Victorious was de-
voted to training and experi-
mental work. Illustrious has
only become operational once
more after several months out of
service. Implacable was not ex-
pected to be operational again
till the end of the year.
Of the light fleet-carriers only
Ocean and Triumph were opera-
tional early in the year. Of
those devoted to training and
experiment with special com-
plements, Vengeance was due to
remain temporarily immobilised
until this Brit i si h autumn.
Venerable was being handed
over to the Royal Netherlands
Navy, and Warrior, upon being
replaced by Magnificent (a
14,000-ton sister-ship to Aus-
tralia’s two new air-carriers),
was to refit. Theseus was ex-
pected to be operational about
the beginning of last month and
Glory by an uncertain date.
The historic giants of the
Mediterranean and Pacific wars
—lndomitable, Indefatigable and
Formidable —went to reserve.
There were the two Eagle-
class 33,000-ton fleet-carriers —
new mentions give Eagle’s ton-
nage as 45,000 —under construc-
tion very the only capi-
tal ships building—and 10 fleet-
carriers—the four 18,500-ton
Hermes class and six Majesties
of 14,000 tons, of which the only
ones being proceeded with a
little while ago were the three
which Australia and Canada
agreed to buy. The Australian
Government did its best to mis-
lead the people of this country
into believing that these two
vessels, already designed and
laid down, were its own warlike
inspiration.
Cruisers on the operational
list for 1948 numbered only 16
—including Liverpool, to be
operational by April, 1948,
Sirius, Diadem, Cleopatra and
Belfast, expected to be fightable
in the last quarter this year, and
Jamaica (Fiji class) by the end
of this year. Superb, latest
cruiser in commission, was ex-
pected to be immobilised a few
weeks ago. Thirteen cruisers
were in reserve, some used for
“target practice,” and Devon-
shire, an eight-inch-gun ship—
familiar as a visitor here for the
sesquicentenary and the last
cruiser to own a stem gallery—
as cadet-training vessel, with her
heavy armament reduced to one
twin eight-inch turret.
There were three cruisers—
Tiger class technically
“building,” but with construc-
tion at a standstill.
Of 34 destroyers marked
down as operational, five were
to reach that condition by June,
1948, eight by this month and
three on a later unspecified date.
Ten were under construction, of
which eight belonged to the new
Daring class and are almost in
the light-cruiser range—39oft.
long, 2620 tons, six 4.5’s and 10
40mm. Bofors and 21 in. tubes,
with an imposing turn of speed.
Tribals are being scrapped.
Eighteen destroyers were in
use for experiment and train-
ing and 65 were placed in
reserve.
On the whole it is an unhappy
showing beside the 200-odd de-
stroyers still in service with the
United States Navy early in the
year.
And 25 frigates operational,
18 for training and experiment,
with 136 in reserve, would not go
much further in utility than the
26 out of 65 submarines stated
to be operational.
The only-fighting vessels com-
pleted in the financial year
ended March 31, 1948, were
four Agincourt-class destroyers,
three of the ugly but serviceable
Battleaxes and seven “A”-
class submarines.
One defensive move which
the Commonwealth Govern-
ment should make early is to
wake up the Australian Broad-
casting Commission to the fact
that the British Commonwealth
may before long be forced into
a war with Russia. In the midday
Sunday news session on Sep-
tember 26, when it dealt with
Vyshinsky’s attack on the
Western Powers, the A.B.C.’s
description of that gentle-
man’s behavior sounded as if he
had right on his side, and the
only newspaper comment it
could find to quote upon his
offensive outburst was the
Parisian “Populaire,” a socialist
rag which is as near Communist
as may be and which justified
the Russian outlook.

Ancestors of
an
Industry
William Gregor an English clergyman, was
the discoverer of titanium —a metal of great impor-
tance today in the manufacture of paint, pottery,
glass and leather. In a valley of his own parish, in
Cornwall, Gregor had noticed a black sand with
peculiar magnetic properties. This sand is now
recognised as “ilmenite,” one of the principal
sources of titanium. On examination Gregor found
that almost half the sand consisted of a reddish-
brown solid. Treating this with sulphuric acid, he
obtained a yellow solution which, when heated
with powdered charcoal yielded a purplish coloured
slag. The slag contained titanium —but Gregor,
already a very sick man, was too ill either to carry
investigations further or to isolate the pure metal.
The Rev. William Gregor was born in Cornwall
in 1762, and educated at Bristol and the University
of Cambridge, where he became a Fellow of St.
John’s College and entered Holy Orders. He was
always a keen amateur scientist and, though he
chose to settle in a remote village of his native
county, he quickly acquired a world-wide reputa-
tion as a metallurgical chemist through his analysis
of such complicated substances as topaz, wavellite
and uranium mica. His death from tuberculosis in
1817, at the age of fifty-five, robbed him of the
satisfaction of seeing the importance of his work.
Nevertheless, his work on titanium
gives him a place in that select band of
British chemists to whom the world
owes the discovery of important
elements.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
After eight favorites had been
beaten in a card of eight races and
a string of winners had romped home
at such fancy odds as tens, twenties,
twenty-fives, and 66 to 1, punters at
Rosehill on Saturday had reason to
think they must have killed a China-
man. If they had, it certainly wasn’t
that personable little Celestial Ted
Doon, whose smile, after he had rid-
den home his fourth winner of the
day, would have enhanced the face
of the tiger.
With the promising MacArthur filly
Persist (Clarendon Three-year-old),
and Lone Duke (Windsor Welter),
Doon landed a double for the Kelso
stable, which has lately struck a de-
servedly good trot.. Doon’s other
two winners were Cragside taking the
first Richmond Mixed at 66 to 1, and
Cape Neddick downing Bold Duke
and Kerry Lad in the Hawkesbury
Grand Handicap (lOf.). The six-year-
old Foxbridge gelding Regal Son (B.
Smith) staged a slight reversal of form
by bolting in a very easy winner of
the first Kurrajong Novice (9f.).
In the second Richmond Mixed (7f.)
Saville Row (N. Sellwood) received the
verdict over Dalston (J. Thompson)
after an inexplicable mix-up in which
Thompson entered a protest of which
everyone, apparently, was aware
except the judge, who ordered correct
weight to be signalled; too late then
for anything much to be done about
it. The protest was withdrawn. The
second Novice went to lolanda (E.
Fordyce).
Completing a programme which
threw little light on prospects for the
big Spring meeting, the Gosper
Quality Handicap saw Columnist
again defeated; Rxo Fe (K. Robinson)
was the winner, with Dutchman a
good second. Possibly seven furlongs
is a shade short for Columnist and
possibly he didn’t care for the softish
going, but it was this page’s opinion
after seeing him previously defeated
at Randwick that the horse is, at
present, simply not in the best of
shape.
By Tuesday next we shall know
what has won the Epsom, the Metrop.,
the Derby and sundry other good
races; in the meanwhile —O for that
crystal ball!
The Epsom is, as ever, a very open
affair. Even restricting considerations
to those horses weighted at Bst. or
over, as the history of the race over
the past 30 years suggests can be done
with some confidence, there are stm
at least half-a-dozen with excellent
prospects. For a horse that ha
already won two Doncasters and an
Epsom, Blue Legend is most leniently
handicapped with 8.12, but the theory
of averages is much agin him. Hay-
ing already won an Epsom, Titanic
is also well in at 8.2; however, he
would really haye a better chance it
the distance were a furlong further.
At a mile he needs all the luck ot
the running over the last couple ot
furlongs to get through with his
powerful late finish. Should Breasley
secure a clear passage, Titanic will
go very close to the money.
Some doubts have been raised as to
the fitness of Crusader, who is to
contest the Epsom in preference to
the Metrop., but if recovered from a
reported illness he will have a tip-
top chance —particularly if the going
is soft. He was barely pipped in the
Doncaster by Blue Legend and re-
cently at Randwick won a mile Welter
carrying well over lOst.
Handicapped at B.4,*Thc Groom is
another with bright prospects. Pos-
sibly most in his favor is the fact
that, unlike Blue Legend, Titanic and
Crusader, The Groom should be
handy to the leaders all the way,
plus which he has a strong finishing
run. De La Salle, Denali, Heroic
Sovereign and possibly The Diver
could also be considered, while
Dutchman and Smooth Action im-
press as most likely of the light-
weights.
The Metrop. fortunately does not
look half so open; many have a
chance but none has anything
approaching the credentials of Dark
Marne. Given normal luck he looks
the winner.
The Derby should be, and this year
very likely will be, the race of the
meeting. The three-year-old crop is
outstanding, but no individual has yet
shown himself outstanding among
them. Ten furlongs is about as far
as any of them have gone in public,
and strange things may happen with
the extra quarter-mile of the Derby.
In Sydney, Carbon Copy has done
best of the Melbourne visitors with
his close second to Bernbrook in the
Chelmsford. However, Clement has
beaten Carbon Copy in Melbourne
and many consider Ungar the best
of the three. Of the Sydneyites, Royal
Andrew, Bernbrook, Bold Duke and
Snowstream have made the best im-
pression. On form shown to date
there seems little between the lot of
them, and a close finish seems very
likely.
* * * ♦
Class was not lavishly represented
at Moonee Valley on Saturday, where
the most noteworthy performances
were those of the three-year-olds
Rocket Gun and Phoibos.
Having previously shown his ability
by downing a really good w.f:a. field
at a mile, Phoibos was naturally an
odds-on favorite for the mile Moonee
Valley Stakes over the same trip,
in which he met his fellow three-year-
olds at level weights. Phoibos did
not, this time, lead all the way ; in-
stead, with the St. Magnus colt Gay
Saint “going for the doctor,” the
favorite pleasingly showed himself
amenable to being ridden from be-
hind. Phoibos moved up at the turn
and ran on to a very easy win from
Derrymore and Gay Saint.
In betting on the Pascoe Handicap
(lOf.) for three-year-old colts and
geldings punters showed high disdain
“Jessie , WILL you stop Wearing these slacks of mine!”
for the old proverb “Once bitten,
twice shy.” Having already burnt
their fingers more than once over the
High Caste colt High Tar, they pressed
on regardless, to send him out favorite
once again; and once again the air
was redolent of scorched flesh. Rocket
Gun (Stan Martin), a full-brother to
Melbourne Cup-winner Sirius, finished
as his name suggests, to down the
favorite by a couple of lengths.
Rocket Gun was receiving a lot pf
weight from High Tar, but it still
looked an excellent performance.
In other events at the Valley, the
weekly battle with friend bookie was
fairly even. Solvive (W. Williamson)
taking the first Nulla Nulla High-
weight and Paroxena winning the
Steeple with L. Meenan up were hot
favorites. Miss Prim (J. Gilmore) also
won the Corroboree Handicap and
Hororata (R. Heather) the Quality
Handicap at no fancy odds. How-
ever, the success of Del Rose (H.
Badger) in the Merri Handicap was
less popular, and that of Coiffure
(B. Eames) at 20 to 1 in the second
Highweight positively distasteful.

Sydney’s Riverview college evi-
dently has a couple of lads who know
how to use the legs for more than
mere supports. At the college sports
recently A. Meagher won the 100yds.,
furlong, quarter-mile, half-mile and
mile titles in the senior division, while
R. Burge took the same swag against
the under-sixteen-year-olds.

On our showing against other
Empire reps., including the huge
British team at the Olympic Games,
Australia should do exceptionally well
at the 1950 Empire Games, especially
as the handy venue, New Zealand,
should permit of a large team being
sent. It was actually Canada’s turn
for the Empire Games, but the ques-
tion of dollars caused a change.
Anyone looking from afar to the
high vantage points of The Lakes
(Sydney) golf course on Saturday
would have been justified in suppos-
ing it was a Melbourne football
crowd. One of the biggest The Lakes
has ever had, it turned out, to %ee
how the Australian champion, Ossie
Pickworth, would shape against Jim
Ferrier, ex-Australian and now an
American star, in The Lakes “Open.”
There’d been a lot of talk about Pick-
worth and Ferrier, but that good little
man Eric Cremin was between them.
It was Ferrier, 283; Cremin, 287;
Pickworth, 288. Cremin included a
67 in his score, Ferrier had two 70’s,
Pickworth two 71’s.

The cricketing tourists are on
their way home. The result of
the tour was a triumph for
Australia, though it emphasised
how English cricket has slipped
through the more serious business of
two wars. Of 31 matches (two-day
picnic affairs excluded) Australia won
25 —15 of them with an innings to
spare, seven with wickets up their
sleeve, and one match (the second
Test) by 409 runs; the other eight
were drawn.
The Australians piled up 47 cen-
turies against six by England, and in
19 innings topped 400 runs, England
doing so twice. Morris heads the
individual knocks with 290; Miller,
Brown and Hassett also have topped
the 200 mark. As in 1930, ’34 and
’3B, Bradman heads both aggregate
and averages (2428, av. 89.92), and
scored most centuries (II); he leaves
the game with a barrowful of records
but no greater honor than the cheers
of spectators and players, in tribute
to the mhn himself as much as to his
unequalled cricketing talent.

Collingwood went from the bounce
in the V.F.L. preliminary final at
M.C.G. on Saturday and had three
goals up before Melbourne realised
that the thing had started. Then the
team that had played like a scratch
mob from a shearing-shed on the
previous Saturday pulled itself to-
gether, surveyed the grinning oppo-
sition and settled down to real foot-
ball. Flying marks and long, driving
centre-kicks to the old stagers, Mueller
and Smith, on the half-forward line,
reduced Collingwood' to frantic help-
lessness. By three-quarter time most
of the 65,000 present were thinking
of an early tea, and those who stayed
saw Melbourne gallop on to an easy
25.16-15.11 victory, somewhat gener-
ously allowing the plucked Magpies
to boot a goal or two at the finish.
It’s Melbourne and Essendon for the
premiership next Saturday.

Welter champion Tommy Burns
seems unaccountably less popular with
fight fans than he was of yore. Scaling
10.71 for his non-title bout with
Mickey Tollis (10.51) at Sydney
Stadium, he was hooted to the echo
when the decision was given as a
draw. Actually it was a fair de-
cision, Tollis’s at times pretty counter-
work being balanced by Burns’s con-
tinual aggression.
* * * *
There was another drawn decision
at Leichhardt, where Ken Bailey (9.13)
seemed a trifle lucky to tie with
George Kapeen (10.1). Kapeen was
always the more aggressive party, and
towards the end of the third round
knocked Bailey into oblivion, from
which he was rescued by the bell.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Brian Bureau”: The traveller had
plodded painfully upward over miles of
dusty, winding track and was now almost
at the crest of the range. He paused,
flicked some of the sweat from his fore-
head and looked back at the sun-scorched
desolation through which he had passed ;
not a soul or a habitation was visible,
“I wonder what it’s like on the other
side?” he mused wistfully. Hurrying to
the summit he gazed down at the prospect
before him; it was a tenantless waste.
Involuntarily his arms flung outward in
a gesture of despair. The dormant
swarm of flies on his hat and shoulders
rose and momentarily formed a sinister
sort of halo round his head before settling
down again on him, “They warned me
I’d strike no mates on this route,” soli-
loquized the traveller. “Well, those flies
have stuck to me all the way. They ain’t
exactly good company, but I’d give any-
thing for a chance to drink with th^jn —
a long cold beer with each.”
* * * ♦
“Dusty Gully”: Mrs. Spriggs put down
the mail-order catalogue and shook Tom
out of his concentration on the losing
battle he was waging in triplicate with a
sheaf of official forms. “There’s a pair
of corsets here, Tom,” she said sweetly.
“Yair, I know, but” defended Tom.
Mrs. Spriggs affected not to hear. “Only
three pounds,” she went on. “I simply
have to get them,” “But, woman,” Tom
said. “Y’ know I can’t afford it. By
the time I pay f’r all the necessities”
“But these are necessary, Tom,” his wife
entreated. “I can’t possibly manage
without them.” “Ar, break it down,”
Tom growled. “Wimmin think that
about nearly everything they see. Can’t
y’ wait till we git ahead with things a
bit?” “Oh, Tom, you always say that,”
Mrs. Spriggs said, blinking tears. Tom
applied himself diligently to the forms*
but progress eluded him. He swallowed
uncomfortably and turned again to his
wife. “Aw, well, Betty,” he said gruffly.
“If yVe got t’ have ’em I s’pose y’ll have
t’ git ’em. I’ll write y’ a cheque.” An
hour later, the forms filled in, Tom was
surprised to find Betty still poring over
the catalogue. “WhatTe y’ studyin’
now?” he asked suspiciously. “Just
lookin’ over some of the things again,”
replied Betty. “I’m tryin’ to think out
what I’ll buy with the three pounds if I
decide not to get the corsets.”
♦ * * *
“Bo”: The traveller passing through
the little township registered disgust as
he stood on the verandah of the only
pub and looked up and down the only
street. “What a dump!” he exploded.
“Fancy living here! And fancy dying
here, too, for that matter,” he went on.
“I don’t suppose you even have an under-
taker in the place.” “Course we ain’t —
whadaya think we are —a bunch o’
pansies, havin’ to git fitted with a hard-
wood topcoat?” drawled the long cove
with the wall-eyed dog at his feet. “Well,
dammit, how do you get buried here,
then?” demanded the stranger. The long
joker looked at him with calm deli-
beration ; then he said “Why, we jist
sharpen their feet with an adze an’ belt
’em inter the ground with a seven-pound
hammer!”
“Shamuseen”: The Torres* Strait
legend of “The Ship with the Silver Keel,”
allegedly lying somewhere in the deeps off
Darnley Island, certainly substantiates
“Lower TopsTs” conjecture (B. 8/9/’4B)
that the “Seahawks of Devon” may have
chased their Castilian prey through Aus-
tralian waters. As the progenitors of the
present-day Torres Strait “boys” could
have had no knowledge of the existence
of silver, with which the lost galleon was
allegedly keeled, there was probably some
factual base for the tale. The idea of con-
cealing their precious burden from the
inquisitive eyes of the seahawks by em-
bodying it in the keel could quite feasibly
have occurred to the harried Dons. The
Darnley tradition has it that the false
keel was fitted at Damley, but the re-
fitted vessel was wrecked while only a
short distance on her journey, which was
presumably to the Spanish colony of
Manila.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: On their first holi-
day together for 40 years, the Woolbales
found Perth full and accommodation
scarce. After hours of searching for a*
room, when it looked like a choice be-
tween the Esplanade and a police-cell,
they discovered a hotel that could pUI
them up. The manager smiled a trifle
cynically as he offered them the rooms—
they could have either the bridal-suite
or the ballroom —and Dad dismissed both
with a certain amount of embarrassment.
“Look here, young feller,” he explained.
“All we want is a room where we c’n
doss down fer the night. We don’t want
nothin’ flash.” But the manager was firm.
Ballroom or bridal-suite. He
further, that he was a busy man and
would appreciate a quick decision. After
a hurried consultation the old couple re-
luctantly decided on the ballroom. A
couple of hours later Dad confronted the
manager with a request. “I think we
“yes, you gotta have patience."
better take that bridal-suite after all,” he
apologised. “We don’t feel any too com-
’ fortable in that ballroom. Bless yer soul,
young feller,” he explained. “Mum an’
me ain’t been t’ a dance for years!”
* * * *
“Old-timer”: “While you’re in town,”
Mac said, “y’ might go up t’ the Com-
mercial an’ find out when that travellin’
dentist will be back. Last time I saw
him he told me these two pegs on me
offside’d hafta come out. 1 reckon he’s
right. They’re givin’ me a lot o’ trouble.
Bin givin’ me hell, on an’ orf, ever since
he told me about ’em, so I reckon I’ll
amble in an’ get ’em yanked out nex’
time he’s along. Would y’ mind findin’
out when he’ll be there?” We assured
him that we didn’t and made for town.
We didn’t get back till late that night.
Next morning Mac came down to the
hut. “Didja see about that dentist
bloke?” “Yair, he’ll be there on Wensdee,
two o’clock till half-past four, the notice
said.” “Goodo.” Mac fell into deep
thought and we imagined he was getting
the wind up. “Cheer up, Mac. It don’t
hurt, these days ; not with this, modem
stuff they got t’ kill the pain.” Mac
came out of his reverie. “Aw, it ain’t
that,” he said. “I was just wonderin’ if
it was still the same bloke. Y’ see, it’ll
be seven year nex’ Easter since I saw
him the last time.”
* * * *
“E. 2”: Harry Riddle had come into a
windfall from a departed relative and
was itching to improve his dairy herd.
Having the cash and spending it were
two distinct matters, though, and he
figured on getting a good bull “on the
cheap” from Lonergan’s stud farm, where
Charlie Long worked. Charlie was
approached and agreeable, and he soon
made it known he’d fixed things quietly
with Lonergan for Harry to get a bull
for a mere £l5, Harry took the animal
home, and, though it commanded no re-
spect for its uncouth appearance, was
satisfied i# having a sire for his herd with
the strain of Lonergan’s bloodstock. Dan
was first to remark on it a month later.
“I see y’ got Bottle’s bull,” he said.
“Wha-at?” Harry asked. “Fred Bottle’s
scrub bull,” Dan said. “I wouldn’t have
that thing runnin’ with the herd.” “Wait
till I git me chance with the thievin’
hound! ” said Harry. “All me best cows,
too.” “Well, one thing, Harry, y’ must’ve
got him cheap,” Dan consoled. “Yairs,
he .was cheap f’r a good bull,” Harry
said. “What might y’ reckon I gave f’r
him?” “Couple quid,” Dan ventured.
“Cripes, he set me back fifteen!” Harry
wailed. “What’d y’ reckon Charlie Long
made on the deal?” “Well, I heard
Bottle gave him half a nicker t’ take the
bull away in the bush an’ shoot it,” Dan
said. “But I wouldn’t let that worry y’,
Harry. Y’ must’ve put it over Charlie by
bearin’ him down t’ fifteen notes; he’s
probably grizzlin’ his head orf now that
he didn’t stick out f’r twenty.”

“Lower Tops’l”: S.A.’s Cape Jaffa
light (B. 8/9/’4B) is the strangest light-
house I’ve seen on the Australian coast,
but I’d hate to live there. The structure,
which took five years to erect back in
the 70’s, is built of iron-screw piles on
the surf-washed granite rocks of the Mar-
garet Brock Reef, five miles to seaward
of Cape Jaffa. About 30ft. above the
swirling ocean and amongst a scaffolding
of round iron is a two-storied nine-
roomed house and kitchen, from the
centre of which rises a tube, surrounded
by more scaffolding, until it reaches a
lantern, 100 ft. above sea-level. Ten years
ago it was still an old hand-wound model
floating in mercury. A jetty, also on
screw piles, leads away 80yd. to a landing
stage and davits by a rocky shelf. Three
keepers are attached to the station, though
they spend two weeks on duty and the
third ashore with their families at King-
ston, 14 miles away, A weekly relief —
weather find surf permitting—by fishing-
boat brings the stores. But what beats me
is how those iron piles, constantly washed
by surf, do not corrode away.

“Waddlin’ Willie”: Pelsart Island, in
the Abrolhos group on the Westralian
coast, has the only pigeon-mail service in
Australia. The birds carry messages
written on cigarette-papers over the 36
miles of water separating the island from
Geraldton. Introduced by a crayfisher-
man trading with the islands, the service
advises Mcßobertson Miller’s Aviation
Company of the number of passengers
to be taken to Perth. On the map the
Abrolhos are just a few specks in the
Indian Ocean. It was in 1628 that a high-
pooped Dutch merchantman, the Batavia,
was wrecked there. The crew was able
to get ashore with some provisions, and
the ship’s master Francis Pelsart, made a
remarkable voyage to Batavia in a small
boat for help. While he was away half
of the crew mutinied and slew most of
the others. Captain Pelsart returned with
another ship and captured the mutineers,
hanging all but two on the spot. These
two were put ashore and never heard of
again.

“Kelms”: A well-meaning chap who
came all the way from the U.S.A. to start
a cattle “ranch” in New Guinea had
the misfortune to fall fair of the flapper
press, and he’ll probably spend the rest
of his life trying to live down the pub-
licity they’ve given him. He’s described
as “loose-limbed,” which means, I sup-
pose, that he can move his arms and
legs; and when a Customs official asked
if he had any ammunition for the shot-
gun he carried, he is reported to have
said no, but he could hit a running rabbit
with that gun. If the statement is cor-
rect, he’ll be a hero to every outback
schoolkid, some of whom have been
known to miss a running rabbit with a
piece of rock —a much more throwable
missile. It’s to be hoped that nobody
introduces him to the ammo that goes
with the gun. If he discovers how easy
it is to hit a running rabbit when the gun
is employed in the correct manner, he’ll
probably join the ranks of the city
“sports” who invade the countryside at
week-ends. Then New Guinea will miss
the opportunity for which it is waiting,
and the cocky will have another pest
to contend with.

“Horseless Horseman”: Mention of
that droving experience in Dajarra pad-
dock of Arumpo station in 1932 (B.
8/9/’4B) recalls another incident that
occurred a few days earlier. From the
Pooncarie common we obtained per-
mission—after a lot of argument—to take
a short-cut through Tarcoola, a mere
selection of some 60,000 acres, provided
we awaited the arrival of the manager be-
fore proceeding with the mob jambed up.
At sunrise next morning we were stand-
ing by the brake when the manager can-
tered out of the scrub straight up to me
without drawing rein.. “Do you know
what?” he asked. X felt certain he had
changed his mind! “Phar Lap’s dead,”
he told us. And all that morning with the
talk of the Red Terror’s exploits, so far
as the mob was concerned, we repeated
the Saltbush Bill act.

“L.P.”: I know of rabbit-warrens that
would make that 90ft. x 30ft. one men-
tioned by “Betcha” (B. 15/9/’4B) look
like a pophole. It’s in the old, dry and
shallow alluvial diggings, where drives
were put through and connected up from
shaft to shaft along the lead, and where
the 'rabbits later found their way into
the old, crumbling workings, that the big
warrens are to be found. Recently I put
a ferret in what looked like a nice, three-
opening burrow. Nothing happened in
the next two hours, and I was about to
give it up as a bad job when I noticed
some cottontails bobbing up from a hole
further down the diggings. That’s where
I found my. ferret—about 300yds. from
the opening I put it in!

“The Pirate”: Ocean-going ships letting
go 100-fathom lengths of cable (B.
8/ 9/ ’4B) reminds me of Finschhafen in
1944, then the biggest base in the Pacific.
For want of anchorages upwards of 100
steamers were always compelled to drift
around the ocean. Skippers of Liberty
ships particularly used to come into
Langemak Bay and let go anchor in
about 90 fathoms. More often than not,
with the great weight of chain suspended
over the bow, the chain took charge and
the windlass brakes wouldn’t hold, I
can hear the rasping roar now and see
everyone rushing off the forecastle just
ahead of the end of the chain which used
to fly up and overboard. Then, minus
an anchor and cable, the vessel would
stand out to sea to drift around as before.
* * * *
“Kerin Paul”: Brolgas which appear
occasionally south of the Divide are
timid and suspicious, and have good
reason to be so. I’ve watched them on
the plains around Cressy, in Victoria’s
Western District, but couldn’t approach
within 100 yards. The flock just kept
walking away, some pausing every few
yards, with wings raised, to bow and
point like ballet-dancers. They are
nomadic, seldom staying two days in
one locality, and I’ve never known them
to nest in the district, although the
swampy land around Lake Corangamite
would suit them. They can soar to a
great height, and probably go north to
breed.
* * * ♦
“Wonk”: Tich nursed his aching jaw
and wallowed* in gloom. It wasn’t the
five bob to get his tooth out that worried
him, but, considering the two-quid fares
on the mail-car, plus an overnight stay
in town, he doubted whether it was worth
it. He’d get rid of it some way. After
a half-hearted attempt with the pincers,
he got a fishing-line, twitched it tight
round the molar, and plaited the slack
into a rope. Next he fetched his nag,
wove the rope securely to her tail
and ordered her to “Giddap.” She
moved slowly. Suddenly Tich grabbed
frantically at her tail, she took
fright, and stopped only when Ted
Woods cornered her by his gate. Two
weeks later the little bloke was sitting
on the step as his benefactor came round
the corner. “Nice sort you are,
Woodsie,” he growled at him. “No sense
at all.” Ted stopped in amazement.
“Well, I like that!” exclaimed Ted.
“That’s all a man gets for savin’ y’r life!
Let me tell you, y’ were in a bad way
when I caught y’ that day. Broke ribs,
an’ y’r hide worn off, an’ took time off
t’ drive y’ into the doc.’s an’ get y’
patched up, an’ ” “Yair, I know,”
growled Tich, holding his jaw. “But why
the blazes didn’t y’ get me flamin’ tooth
yanked out while we were there!”
MOONLIGHT.
1 walked across the paddocks wide
One quiet, moonlight night,
When all the grasses, like a tide,
Swept by in silver light.
It was a breathless sight!
In cloistered groups dim clumps of trees,
As if in sacred mood,
All steeped in bushland mysteries
Of leaf and sap and wood,
Like congregations stood.
The clumps of pines I hardly knew
For, where were plumes of green.
I saw but steeples pointing blue
Up to the starry scene,
All lit with silver sheen.
How magic was the gentle hush
Beneath that arc of sky!
How far from me now seemed the bush!
An interloper, I
Trod awed and softly by.
VICTORIA.
JAMES HACKSTON.


“Eastern”: Dad strode into the post-
office with his load, learned that, owing to
the shorter working week, the service-cars
were no longer calling there, and, dash-
ing for his truck, made the office-pub on
the main highway with a minute to
spare. Then, propping himself on the
verandah, he gave generous voice to his
pet grievance. “It’s this blasted forty-
hour \yeek,” he told the world. “Never
will be any good t’ anybody!” “You’re
dead right there, mate,” the stranger in
the sports-shirt chipped in. “I been say-
ing it from the start, but nobody’d listen.”
Dad invited him into the bar, and con-
tinued. “It’ll ruin the flamin’ country,
that’s what it’ll do,” he groveled. “An’
the trouble is we can’t do anything about
it.” “Well, I don’t know.” The stranger
downed his drink and waited for a refill.
“If we get as many as we can on our side
and keep yelling loud enough they’ll do
something sooner or later.” “But, they’re
talkin’ thirty-six hours now,” roared the
old bloke. “Gripes, it’s plain ridic’lous.”
“Just what I tell ’em,” agreed sports-
shirt enthusiastically. “Do the job an’
be done with it, I say. Why chop a
cherry in bits to eat it? Twenty-four, I
tell ’em; twenty-four hours a week’s
enough for any man!”
* * * *
“Sur Cingle”: You follow the creek for
a blistering, stony mile or two, bindi-eye,
broken red rock and occasional patches
of dead-finish and myall. At last, lost
in a wilderness of naked red hills, you
reach a rockfall by a chain of dry water-
holes. The place is silent and, except for
an optimistic crow, dead. The sky is
blue-white with heat, the rocks are an
oven and you feel tired and thirsty and
very small. But there on the level rock-
slabs by the dry holes are emu-tracks,
lifesize and lifelike ; following them are
man-tracks, while to one side an old-man
kangaroo has left his toe-marks on the
rock-face. But the holes are dry, and
“Hosiery-repair department, please .”
there are no kangaroos and emus. You
look further and find, mixed among the
tracks, strange signs: a circle with a dot
in the middle, a row of engraved dots, a
sign pronged like a pitchfork. But over
all the rocks, for 100 yards up the creek,
wander the tracks, engraved for ever in the
stone, so real that the stockmen say “they
must’ve been made when the rocks were
mud.” You climb up the jumbled rock
to the open gibber hillside above. There
are the camps, their presence indicated by
white quartzite flakes and stone imple-
merits scattered on the red gibbers. It is
all so deathly still and lifeless. And yet,
when the holes were full, only a genera-
tion or two ago, there were friendly fires
and talk and laughter, and brown children
hunting lizards round the rocks. Only
musterers come that way now, and
scientific blokes with cameras and note-
books ; but the tracks remain, graven by
stone tools in stone, and will remain while
the stone itself persists.
* * * *
“Propalong”: An Adelaide zoologist,
while poking round a swamp somewhere
west of Lake Torrens, disturbed a kan-
garoo family at its morning drink. With
Dad in the lead the two adult hoppers
thumped a few yards up the sandhill and
then stopped to assess the biped’s inten-
tions, Joey, however, continued to count
tadpoles at the water’s edge. Just then the
villain, in a red coat and bushy tail,
appeared and commenced to stalk the
infant ’roo. The old man, who had been
examining his first live scientific specimen,
now saw the fox and thumped his
scrapers hard on the sand. Mum, hearing
the signal, flung up her head, scrutinised
the scenery, spotted the fox and made
some small, quick movement, but, appar-
ently, no sound. Joey, however, appeared
to receive the signal and, without hesita-
tion, dived for Mumma. Reynard made
a fast dash to intercept his breakfast, only
to be met by the old lajly, who rolled him
over with one quick boot to the starboard
ribs. The zoological cove then abbre-
viated the fox’s career with a bullet, and
the Macropus menage hit for the mulga,
no doubt discussing the strange things
you meet these days round swamps.
♦ * * ♦
“D.R.H.”; The sand was blank, wind-
swept and clean, save for a tiny mottling
of tracks that led to a very faint ring-
like mark some 2in. in diameter. A
cautious investigation with a twig re-
vealed that the innocent disc of smooth
red sand within the almost imperceptible
circle was actually a round piece of soft
and flexible silk, on the upper side of
which sand grains had been gummed so
perfectly as quite to disguise the cover.
For cover it was, shielding a vertical,
silk-lined tunnel that went down Sin. or
lOin. to the bedroom of a large and hand-
some trapdoor spider, a greenish-grey in-
dividual with the usual trapdoor equip-
ment of poison fangs. A question arises:
assuming that the spider lifted off the
soft sand-masked cover at the time of
her nocturnal hunting, how did she, on
returning to the hole, manage to re-
arrange the cover from below so that it
lay smooth and unwrinkled, simulating
windswept sand?
* * * ♦
“Solitude”; We skirted a bunch of
Herefords in the gully and eyed them
critically. “Bit holler,” remarked Seventy-
fiver. “Ain’t had a drink lately,” Riding
on to the one decent watering-place in
several miles we found a tourist camped
on the bank. “Sorry, mate,” Seventy-
fiver began, “but the cattle won’t come
for water while you’re here.” “Then they
can go somewhere else for the next week,”
came the defiant reply. “This here’s a
good spot to camp.” I dug a heel in
savagely, caught the low movement of the
old bloke’s mitt, and dragged my nag
back. “Yair, that’s what I always say,”
he answered the stranger affably. “But
y* can’t get none o’ the locals t’ camp
here; not since old Charlie tried it.”
“Why, what’s the matter with it?”
“Snakes,” hissed the old bloke, confiden-
tially. “Tigers, Charlie said. Place is
alive with ’em.” He paused as^ the leaves
rustled under a bush near by. “Course, a
bloke c’n keep track o’ the things while
he’s awake,” Seventyfiver continued,
eyeing the bush warily, “but Charlie s
trouble was he went t’ sleep.” His gaze
roamed uneasily round every patch of
cover. “Hard t’ see, tigers,” he remarked,
“It’s a good way from town here, too, and
blokes don’t come this way much. Ol’
Charlie was dead two days afore they
found him. Nice bloke, Charlie,” he
mourned. “Them there’s his meat-tins.”
Three hours later we rode back past the
watering-place. The Herefords were in
possession.

“Narrin”: The station kids had been
yelling and splashing in the waterhole for
an hour or so when Jimmy chanced to
look up at the low cliff overhanging the
pool. Next minute he was streaking over
the bindi-eye, shouting “Dad! There’s
a snake eatin’ the swallers —come quick! ”
The old man and a shotgun were soon
hurrying over to the hole. “Where’s the
snake?” he wanted to know. “Up the
“Sure I'll come along; where'll We go ?”
cliff, Dad —he’s got his head in one o’ the
bottle-swallers’ nests.” “But you bin
makin’ a corroboree down there enough
t’ frighten a mob o’ snakes —I heard y’ up
at the office.” However, the snake was as
described and the shotgun blast finished
it, and also a portion of the martin’s nest
it had rifled. A brief examination then
revealed why J. Blake had stayed on the
scene during the kids’ noisy bath session.
Joseph had inserted his front-end into
the bottle-shaped nest, swallowed the four
young fairy-martins and then had found
himself too corpulent to withdraw. If
Jimmy had not chanced to look up at the
cliff the slippery cove would no doubt
have waited philosophically until his
digestive processes had freed him from
his prison.

“Gravelsnatcher”; “Frank Hum-
phrey’s” goanna which, pursued by dogs,
reached a tree and made a more or less
leisurely ascent (B. 25/8/’4B) is a stranger
to me. He obviously means a racehorse
“go,” since the old bobtail couldn’t run
and would sooner offer futile fight, any-
way. And a racehorse goanna’s passage
up a tree is something that is seldpm
seen, even by a keen watcher. I’ve put
up many a “go” with a pair of ’roo-dogs,
and the most I’ve seen has been two fleet
hounds racing along either flank of a
sand-wave, in the middle of which the
“go” is making tracks. Suddenly the
dogs stop, and retrace their steps about
20 yards to a jarrah sapling, on the top
of which a new branch has appeared.
I’ve seen that much often, but of the
“go’s” rise from earth to tree-top I’m as
much in the dark as my dogs—and they
were trained for the job. Back in the
days of freedom I made money selling
“gos” to Ah Fat and his gardening associ-
ates. Half-a-crown each, and they took
all .1 could get.
* * * *
“Blime”; Pete’s sheepdog was a bit
slow, and his owner was getting fed up.
“Think I’ll keep me eye open for another
dog,” he remarked. “A good ’n.”
“Gripes, I got a real champ y’ c’n have
f’r a fiver,” Snowy told him. “This bloke
behind the nag here. I’ll show y’ what he
c’n do, soon’s we get out o’ town. He
won’t work with folks around. Temp-
’ramental, Champ is, like them fillum
stars. Good, though.” Half a mile out
Snowy decided conditions were right for
the tryout. “See them sheep up the road?”
he said. “Well, now you watch Champ.”
He whistled, and the dog showed a
nervous interest. “Aw, it’s that cove over
yonder; he cracked a whip,” Snowy ex-
plained. “Champ won’t work if there’s
a whip. Just like he don’t like another
mong about, either. An’ don’t never
roar at ’im or he won’t do nothin’.”
With the coast clear once more, Snowy
tried again. “Here, Champ,” he
wheedled. “Go way, there. I said, go
way.” The dog trotted forward and
chased the sheep where they wanted to
go. “There y’ are,” came Snowy’s
chuckle. “What’d I tell y’? Don’t never
try t’ force him though, an’ remember,
he don’t like workin’ in strong wind.”
“Righto,” Pete nodded slowly. “Just
one more thing, Snow,” he whispered
cautiously. “D’ y’ think the beggar’d
mind if I have a smoke now ’n’ then?”

“B. A. Ker”: I awoke badly shaken —
in two senses. In the first place I had
been having a horrible nightmare, and
in the second my pole-and-chaffbag bunk
was still rocking from the impact of the
weighty body that had collided with it.
Never having been conspicuously brave,
I spent the next few seconds wondering
whether my meagre possessions were
worth fighting for, and whether it might
not be advisable to be a coward for five
minutes instead of a corpse for the rest
of my life. I ceased to have a
choice; the intruder had crawled
under the bunk and was heaving up-
ward, trying to hurl me out! In my
hurried vacation of the doss I forgot
about the blankets wound around me, and
landed, hog-tied, on the ground. Ex-
pecting any second to feel hands closing
on my throat I groped wildly for a
weapon, found something that turned out
to be a Blucher-boot, and prepared to
die boot in hand. Suddenly there
was a crash—the interloper must have
crawled out from the other end of the
bunk and blundered into the kerosene-
case cupboard that stood against the back
wall of the tent. But now his voice
gave him away as he proceeded to dive
into the contents. The whack I got
home with the heel of the boot was a
good ’un; it must have been by the way
he shot out —straight through the wall
of the tent! Ten minutes later, after
I’d tracked down my pants, extracted
matches from the pocket, wasted half a
box finding the hurricane-lamp and the
other half in lighting the broken-glassed
thing, I savagely surveyed the mess of
jam, sugar, butter and flour. But the
most heartrending sight was the huge
hole to be stitched up in the back of the
tent. Moral: Never take stern (literal)
measures when a stray pig comes snoop-
ing into your tent.

“Mat’s Mate”: Mat was debating with
a wheat baron out of Underbool the
contract price for clearing bull mallee and
pine off about 100 acres. We wanted
175., his price was 135., and bit by bit
the two margins crept toward each other,
first by deeners, then successively by zacs,
treys and pennies. They met at 155.,
which, of course, was where both sides
intended they should meet from the be-
ginning. Then Mat set about getting a
few concessions like meat and milk and
free carriage of goods from the town.
When he hit the boss for a pair of axe-
files the boss howled, “Gripes, you’ll want
portholes in your flamin’ coffins.” “You
wouldn’t,” Mat snapped. “Why wouldn’t
I?” demanded the boss, hotly. “’Cos
y’d be too flamin’ tight t’ let the worms
see in for nothin’,” Mat snorted. It
nearly lost us the contract.

“Dekko”: Doubtless the Great Temple
at Baalbek was the Temple of Jupiter
(B. 8/9/’4B), as that deity was the chief
of the Roman gods. What is known as
the Temple of Bacchus is the smaller
one to the south of it. Although Arabs
will tell visitors that Solomon built the
Great Temple this is not true; in fact, it
was built by Antoninus Pius (a.d.
138-161). It is said to have contained
a golden statue of the sun-god. The
temple was converted into a fortress after
the Arabs sacked the city in a.d. 748.
Timur Beg sacked it again in 1400, and
in 1759 what was left of Baalbek was
drastically affected by a violent earth-
quake, Apparently from a remote period
Baalbek was the chief centre dedicated
to the worship of the sun-god, for its
name means the Place of Baal.
WITH LUCAS ON THE ’BIDGEE.
Ole Luke had seventeen children,
(There’s some have said a score);
Be that as it may, they were welcome
When Kennedy’s sheep was shore.
When Lucas roamed the claypans,
The ’Bidgee was running low;
But the beer was always in plenty;
Was it forty year ago?
They travelled at night with the wethers,
And hid in the flats by day;
If you saw strange sheep, ’twas a mirage,
Like they get out Geraki way.
In a saltbush marsh they was yarded,
And shorn at the dead of night.
The Lucas kids they penned them,
An’ baled the wool up right;
An’ to Melbourne sales they trucked it—
Fleece, with the Kennedy mark.
Lucas a thief an’ a liar?
Maybe, but never a nark.
(The white shorn backs aglimmer
Flowed beneath moonlit trees;
The embered eyes of the sheepdogs burned,
Their hurry an anguish of fleas.)
Twas at Deni court where they had him,
Lucas stood up in the dock
That the white-ants used for their kipsie.
The copper turned grey from the shock:
For, “Y’r Worship,” said Luke, “I’m that sorry
Ye’ve had so much trouble with me
F'r travelling be day an’ travelling be night,
An’ me children’s tricks —I can’t see!”
(And as time is wearing the plains out,
The legend of Lucas it grows;
Was he dinkum blind when he stole the sheep?
That only the bluebush knows!)

THE M AN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT OT GRAZCOS."
Woolclassing Standards.
“Murrawong”: D. A. S.
Campbell, president of N.S.W.
and Q’land Woolbuyers’ Associa-
tion, and W. G. Hunt, a wool
valuer, recently made a joint
criticism of them. In their
opinion the preparation of clips
for market has deteriorated
steadily year by year. They
want standards of classing im-
proved by increasing the status
of the professional woolclasser.
Under the Woolclasser’s
Award a competent classer is
one who can supply proof that
he has served for three seasons
as a practical woolclasser in
shearing-sheds or who has had
three seasons’ practical experi-
ence as a woolsorter, plus one
season’s experience as a prac-
tical classer in sheds. The critics
contend that the classer should
also possess the certificate of
the N.S.W. Technical College
or a similar certificate issued in
other States.
Every classer will insist that
while theoretical experience is
advisable, practical experience
makes success in handling clips.
There has always been difficulty
in getting the necessary ex-
perience. Well-known classers
have no trouble in obtaining
good sheds ; the newcomer finds
it hard, except at the peak of
the shearing season, to get an
opening. The Woolclassers’
Association does not admit
classers to full membership un-
less they can produce satisfac-
tory references from brokers
covering three seasons. The
Association does, however, pos-
sess a long list of probationary
members, and every assistance is
given them to become fully
qualified.
The modern classer is on a
totally different footing from
the classer of 20 years ago, when
there were big sheep properties
everywhere running large flocks
of well-classed sheep of even
ages. These are almost all gone
through closer settlement, and
the number of small flocks far
outweighs the big ones. Few
small properties engage a com-
petent classer, the work being
done by the owner, a son or by
the contractor, whose knowledge
of classing has been picked up
in his shearing days and who
has very rudimentary ideas of
market requirements.
The modern classer is often
required to be boss of the board,
machinery expert and woolroller
as well, and as a result he is
unable to concentrate on his
proper job. Campbell and Hunt
have taken this fact into con-
sideration and recommended
that a classer be not loaded with
these additional jobs. The day
is rapidly approaching, however,
when the classer must be an all-
rounder.
That Income Tax.
“Accountant”: “Graz” (B.
18/8/’4B) answers a problem set
to country accountants June
after June. They agree that
nothing is gained over the long-
term by stocking-up in June.
However, according to the value
of stock on hand at the time of
buying and the incidence of
natural increase at the “selected”
value, average cost will in some
cases have an amazing effect on
the value of the new stock.
“Graz” overlooks this point,
which is well illustrated in the
following examples: (a) where
there were 4000 sheep on hand
at 1 /7/’47 valued at 15s. a head,
2000 lambs were marked (selec-
ted value 10s.); and ( b ) the
same figures except that 1000 are
bought at £2 a head. It is
assumed that there were no
deaths or rations and that sales
were the same;

Although the immediate result
has been to reduce the profit by
£375, owing to the more-or-less
fictitious value of stock on hand,
the overall effect will depend on
sale values in subsequent years.
The average-cost system almost
universally used is rather a
makeshift and will presumably
persist until someone invents a
better one. The effect will not
always be the same; the value
of commencing stock and the
selected price of natural increase
being the determining factors.
At present most sheepmen are
in a position where their stock
on hand is valued at about 10s.
a head, owing to accumulated
natural increase, and sales on
today’s market realise a taxable
profit of about 50s. per head.
“Graz’s” observations on ration
stock are intriguing and deserve
a request to the Commissioner
for a ruling. Possibly this point
could be argued from two
angles ; where stock is killed for
the homestead and where rations
are virtually resold to the hands.
However, owing to the depressed
value of stock on hand brought
about, as outlined above, by
accumulated natural increase,
“Graz” cannot complain at pay-
ing exorbitant prices for his
chops.
Duranbah.
“K.A.S.”: The way to grow
bananas is amply demonstrated
at the Agricultural Department’s
Tropical Fruits experimental
plot at Duranbah, near Tweed
Heads (N.S.W.). Drainage and
terracing are the outstanding
features of this system, the
drains to keep outside surface
water, following rains, from
entering the plantation, the
terraces, within the plantation,
“W ell , fancy that—Wave run out of chaff”
safeguarding against internal
wash.
The plot is situated about half-
way down a gentle slope, and
V-shaped ditches, Ift. to 2ft.
deep, are dug round its whole
perimeter. The upper boundary
gutter, running across the slope,
intercepts the water coming
down from the higher ground,
stops it from cascading down the
banana rows and passes it down
the two side-channels into the
lower boundary drain. From
there it escapes into the stream
below. The terraces are low
walls of piled stones Ift. to 2ft.
high, with the earth banked up
behind them. They run in
parallel lines across the planta-
tion at right-angles to the direc-
tion of slope. The gradient
being gentle, the general rule is
one terrace to every second or
third row, but in the steepest
part every row is terraced.
There are occasional gaps for
drainage.
A subsidiary erosion check is
the scattering of chopped-up
banana stems, stalks, leaves and
other plant waste through the
patch. This also provides a de-
gree of natural fertilisation and
tends to keep the ground moist
and cool.
Artificial fertilisation, rapidly
becoming a “must” in N.S.W.
banana - culture, is regularly
practised. The tonic used is
P. 8.10, a blood-and-bone base
compounded with sulphates, and
the dose is 31b. per bearing stool
per annum. Though P. 8.10 isn’t
cheap (£l7 a ton), the excellent
results justify the outlay.
Irrigation is laid on through-
out the plot, but is used only to
supplement the natural annual
rainfall of 68in. The artificial
rain is turned on most often in
dry winter and spring spells,
and rarely exceeds 7in. in any
one year. Water is piped uphill
from a stream-well by a 6-h.p.
diesel - driven pump, and is
applied by sprayers from points
in a parellel-row system of pipe-
lines. Cost of the plant’s instal-
lation, though over £6OO, was
modest in view of the returns it
makes possible.
Bananas don’t monopolise the
plot, though they occupy three
of its five acres. The remaining
two acres are taken up by a
tropical-fruit plants nursery, in
which are grown papaws, pine-
apples, avocado pears, Queens-
land bush-nuts, pecan-nuts and
mangoes. All seem to be doing
very well, especially the papaws,
which equalled anything I have
seen in 16 years in the deep
tropics. Some single-stem trees
carried. 150 papaws. This is in
part due to the of P. 8.10
that each tree receives every 18
months. The banana patch is
commercially worked, and its in-
come goes a long way to meet-
ing the plot’s expenses, includ-
ing wages. The yield is high—
one irrigated acre produced 388
cases in 12 months.
Duranbah’s red volcanic soil
had been under sugar-cane—a
soil-dogger—for 30 years before
the plot was laid out in 1938.
The yield of this heavily-used
ground shows that growers
needn’t necessarily condemn
themselves to “hillbilly” exist-
ences in steep and eroding back
gullies for the sake of virgin
soil. The plot’s gentleness of
slope, freedom from frost, prox-
imity to the sea (2| miles),
handiness to a good road and
n.-n.-e. aspect are points often
urged by the department upon
intending growers in selecting
plantation sites. It’s an object-
lesson in the intelligent and in-
tensive use of a small area —the
best and most profitable form of
tropical agriculture.
Success with a Pump.
“Agric”; Using a Pomona
turbine-pump in a 6in. bore-hole
112 ft. deep, with a specially-
perforated length of casing at
the bottom, to allow a maximum
inflow of water, R. M. Reynolds,
Naranga Hereford Stud, Nor-
win (Q.), is irrigating a 16-acre
paddock with a 10-chain pipe-
line at the rate of 10,000 gal.
per hour. The pump is driven
by a 20-h.p. diesel engine ; the
district is not served by elec-
tricity. In the initial trial, 16
acres have been sown to oats,
linseed and other winter crops,
and the response is excellent.
Spray-lines deliver the equivalent
of lin. of rain per hour with-
out affecting the water-level in
the bore, and as the result of
Reynolds’s experiment a great
transformation is expected over
that part of the Darling Downs.
Chick Health.
“Urana”: Unabsorbed yolk
supplies the chick’s food for the
first few days. Often chicks die
when young or when almost full-
grown for no apparent reason,
and when opened are found still
to contain some unabsorbed
yolk. Improper incubation, over-
heating, chilling and crowding
are believed to be conditions
which interfere with the proper
assimilation of the yolk. A com-
mon symptom of the trouble is
poor feathering. Often badly-
covered birds which die are
found to have yolk in them
when opened. It is good manage-
ment to preyent chilling and
overheating of the brooders and
help prevent the wastage of
chicks brought about by yolk-
trouble.
Growing Bacon.
“Jock”; The man who runs
pigs as a sideline will get valu-
able information from W. S.
McAuliffe, Pi g Husbandry
Adviser, reporting in the
“Journal of Agriculture” (S.A.)
for July, on the State Bacon
Carcass Competition. The
analysis of results shows the
most successful pig is the Large
White-Berkshire cross, followed
by Berkshire, L.W., Berkshire-
Tamworth cross, and L.W.-Tam-
worth cross.
Apart from breeding, the
main factors are picking the
right type of animal and feeding
him correctly. He should be
long, well-proportioned and
even, short in the leg and set
near the ground. The winning
carcasses were fed a full protein
diet to produce plenty of lean
meat and good “streaking,” and
they all had milk and greenfeed
in their diet. Barley appeared to
be the most satisfactory base for
feeding, and the observation is

cut, too!
Secret of Rainbow’s flexibility is the coupling. Easy to connect-

made that whey is insufficiently

Preserving Galvanised-iron.
“Atlanta”; Paint preserves
roofs. Rust patches on old iron
should ffist be treated with a
prime coat of metallic-zinc-dust
paint before the whole roof is
covered with the same paint.
This gives two coats to rusty
areas and one to the rest of the
roof. If metallic-zinc paints are
unprocurable a good brand of
iron-oxide (red) roofing paint is
the next best. Lead-base paints
are poisonous, and must not be
applied to roofs used as catch-
ment for stock or domestic pur-
poses.
Paint is costly, and small but
useful quantities remaining in
tins after completion of a job
will soon deteriorate due to a
thick skin forming on the sur-
face. This can be prevented by
pouring a small quantity of
melted paraffin over the surface,
A strong cord looped through
the paraffin before it hardens
will facilitate quick removal.
Bending Water-pipes.
“Radian”: When packing a
pipe for bending (B. 18/8/’4B)
make certain that the sand is
perfectly dry. A pipe filled with
damp sand, plugged jit each
end and then heated, constitutes
a booby-trap. During apprentice
days 1 saw a plug blow out like
a shot from a gun, strike a
fitter in the face and cause
serious injuries. While the sand
method is satisfactory for the
general run of pipes, it is not
rigid enough for light-gauge
copper tubing as used in some
engine exhausts and hot-water
systems.
Usual procedure with thin-
walled pipe is to anneal it
thoroughly, then fill with molten
resin or lead. When the filling is
cool the pipe may be bent with-
out kinking or risk of collapse.
Later the pipe is heated evenly
and the filling melted out.
Small-diameter copper tube-—in
common use for petrol and oil
lines on engines—is easily bent
without filling if first softened
by annealing. To anneal copper
heat to a clear red and plunge
in cold water. Melting-point of
copper is fairly low, therefore
some care should be taken when
heating tubing or other light
sections.
Summer Vegetables.
“Myrrhee”: In Victoria sum-
mer vegetables do best in beds
that have been prepared well in
advance of planting. Turned in
now, weed-growth quickly de-
cays and this, with stable manure
or compost, increases the water-
holding capacity of the soil in
dry weather. Don’t turn the
organic matter under too deeply
—6in. is enough. Except for
beans (which need super.) apply
a 3:1:1 mixture—super., sul-
phate of ammonia and potash,
2oz, per square yard to the sur-
face and rake in about a fort-
night before planting. For vine
vegetables, dig a hole 18in. deep,
put a 4in. to 6in. layer of rotted
organic manure at the bottom,
and fill up, making a saucer-like
depression to take the plant.
Hints for the Farm.
“Myrr”: Cockerels can be
reared to rooster age on grain
and a dry mash, but it must have
a higher proportion of protein
(about 20 p.c.) than a mash used
to top off mature birds. The
reason is that they’re’growing
rather than fattening, and even
at marketing stage will carry
much more flesh than fat. Here
is a mash capable of supplying
the necessary proteins, and
bringing the birds to good mar-
ket condition: Bran, 241 b.; pol-
lard, 351 b.; wheatmeal, maize-
meal or crushed oats, 201 b.;
livermeal, 51b.; whey-powder,
51b.; meatmeal, 101 b.; salt, 11b.
Give them one grain feed, late
in the afternoon, just sufficient
to satisfy their immediate appe-
tites.
“Mozzer”: Lippia is hot a
grass, therefore caution is needed
before giving it the treatment
suggested for lawns. Most lawn
manures are not suitable for
lippia because they contain sul-
phate of ammonia. A good fer-
tiliser is three parts super., one
part blood manure, and five parts
bone and organic manure ; 2-4-D
and other selective weedicides
should not be used for the same
reason. Before topdressing the
lippia with loam, give it a dress-
ing of manure and plant seed in
the worn patches.
“Bill C.”; After being in use
constantly for five to six years
a wireless may develop a pro-
nounced hum and only give weak
reception of local stations (B.
1/9/’4B). This suggests that
most, if not all, of the conden-
sers are worn out and should be
replaced. Crackling and frying
noises from a fairly old set are
caused by a faulty transformer.
(In a new set, such noises point
to a bad connection somewhere
in the chassis.) The cost of re-
placing condensers is not exces-
sive.
“Big Billy”: A mixture of
three parts blood and bone, two
parts super, and one part muri-
ate of potash is an ideal dressing
for the average flower-garden.
Use annually in the spring on
all flower borders at the rate of
2oz. a square yard, dug into the
border where the ground is bare
or worked into the soil as a
topdressing between growing
plants.
“L.G.A.”: Leather belting
should be dressed with draught
castor-oil. Warm the oil to
blood-heat and brush well into
leather. Do not run a belt for
a few hours after dressing.

Familiar Formula.
Dr. Repulsev, the Minister
for Torture in the new Com-
munist “Government” of Indo-
nesia, was emphatic that the in-
surrection in Java had not been
inspired from outside the
country.
“It is utterly ridiculous to
suppose,” he asserted, “that just
because your Comrade Sharkey,
with the permission of the Aus-
tralian Government, visited the
Communist - party leaders in
these parts, that he had any
more to do with fostering our
revolution than he did the one
in Malaya which broke out
soon after he visited Communist-.
party leaders there. It was pure
coincidence in both cases.”
“I suppose,” said the inter-
viewer, “he came up here
especially to play you billiards.”
“Yes,” said Dr. Repulsev
quickly. “That was it —billiards.
We had some most enjoyable
games.”
“But there isn’t a billiard-
table in the whole of this place
you call a city!” pursued the
interviewer.
Dr. Repulsev thought hard for
a minute. Then his face lit up.
“Up here,” he said, “we don’t
use a table —we found it slowed
the game up too much.”
“And do you have cues?”
The Minister registered intense
“I keep tellin' you , man —THAT’S starboard !”
relief at this obvious departure
at last from an awkward subject.
“Oh, no,’* he said. “Why would
people want to line up when
under our efficient Communist
rule there is an abundance of
everything for everyone‘s The
people have never been so
happy” he broke off and
went to the door.
“What’s all that hammering
going on outside, comrade?” he
asked a guard.
“They’re just finishing erect-
ing the row of gibbets on Dr.
Soprano’s orders, comrade,” was
the answer.
Dr. Repulsev came back.
“Oh, yes. I forgot,” he said.
“We’re hanging over a hundred
Fascists who have refused to ap-
preciate the wonderful benefits
of Communism.”
“Talking of Comrade
Sharkey’s visit,” went on the in-
terviewer, “1 don’t suppose he
remained dumb all the time he
was playing tableless billiards.
We understood in Australia that
the chief object of his visit was
to try to obtain the services of
your brilliant team of Indo-
nesian scientists in an effort to
help us overcome the menace of
an invasion of poisonous gee-
bungs which are threatening our
valuable bandicoot flocks at
Bondi.” >
Dr. Repulsev nodded vigor-
ously. “Yes, yes—that was
exactly what Comrade Sharkey
discussed, now I come to think
of it. He was very worried —
said that unless the bandicoot
flocks could be saved your
country’s whole economy would
be wrecked. We promised all
the help we could give.”
“While he was here he didn’t
also discuss the use of Catalina
aircraft between Australia and
Indonesia, or the menace to
Communism from British im-
perialism in Australia, Malaya,
etc.?”
“Oh, no.”
“No, of course not. We under-
stood the most important- aspect
of his visit was to test the possi-
bility of increasing Australia’s
exports to Indonesia of our sur-
plus stocks of emu hides, platy-
pus oil, goanna feathers, junket-
foundry forges and smoked
stonefish. Was that right?”
Dr. Repulsev again looked re-
lieved. * “Yes, yes,” he said,
“that was it. Our discussions
were amicable. We hope to take
large quantities of the exports
you mentioned.”
“Exactly. By the way, Dr.
Repulsev, of what are you a
doctor medicine, science,
letters, philosophy?”
“Good heavens, no. Every
Indonesian politician helps him-
self to that title—it sounds
more impressive than plain
‘mister.’ We also do it as a
tribute and our expression of
affection for your Dr. Evatt,
who assisted us Communists
here so much by handing over
his foreign policy to Comrade
Healy and his brilliant team of
wharflaborers.”
“By the way, doctor, what is
your answer to allegations that
Moscow financed your revolu-
tion?”
“It is a lie. This is purely a
popular people’s revolution
against the pro-Trotsky, anti-
Stalinist activity of the Fascist
Dr. Soekarno.”
“Excuse me, doctor, but that
envoy, accompanied by two men
in Russian officers’ uniforms
and a political commissar, who
came in a few minutes ago,
spoke something in Russian and
left a cheque on the table —he
was, I suppose, a trade envoy
making payment for some Indo-
nesian exports?”
“Yes, yes—that was it, ex-
ports. We export quite a lot to
Russia.”
“We understand that yqp have
built up quite a trade with the
Soviet in platform-soled snow-
shoes, fur-lined postholes, barrels
of decontaminated smoke,
desiccated-coconut juice and jet-
propelled buckboards. It was
these you were being paid for,
no doubt?”
“That was it!” exclaimed Dr.
Repulsev eagerly. “We hope
next year to double the exports
to the Soviet of all those items
you mentioned.”

Walter Burley Griffin
In the considerable expansion which is
taking place in Canberra nothing is being
said or done to commemorate the man
who conceived the capital city of Aus-
tralia. Walter Burley Griffin, the de-
signer of Canberra, is the capital’s for-
gotten man.
Griffin had the curious destiny to be
born, reared and educated in one con-
tinent, to carry out his greatest and most
enduring work in, a second and to die and
be buried in a third. When, as a young
Chicago architect, he won the Common-
wealth prize for a design for the national
capital and accepted an offer to come to
Australia to supervise the work, he left
what would probably have been a highly
successful practice in America for a
period of trouble, argument, heartbreak
and loneliness in Australia. This ended
when he went to India to carry out
architectural commissions there. He died
at Lucknow early in 1937.
It is to nobody’s credit that Griffin’s
name has been forgotten in Canberra and
almost erased from the records. True,
he clashed bitterly and violently with de-
partmental heads, leading to a Royal
Commission which largely vindicated
him. Sometimes the departmental heads
were right, sometimes Griffin was. The
departmentalists went into the job in a
mood of square-footed, matter-of-fact
realism, Griffin in a mood of exalted
idealism. The two could not live to-
gether, and did not; but the fact remains
that even the bricks and concrete going
down in Canberra this minute are going
largely where Griffin said in 1912 they
should.
Minor amendments have been made to
his plan, but nobody has altered it in any
substantial way, while several Parlia-
mentary committees have strongly en-
dorsed it. But Canberra itself remains
Griffin’s only memorial, while his name
is steadily fading into obscurity.
Griffin was a shy, sensitive dreamer
in landscape and perspective, yet at the
same time extraordinarily tenacious and
uncompromising on issues of principle.
In his post-Canberra days he built and
lived in the unique suburb at Castlecrag,
near Sydney, where among other things
his passion was for trees.
As a man, Griffin was one of the most
singularly charming and attractive per-
sons I have ever met, one of those rare
men in whom the spiritual order comes
to life. It would be a gracious thing if
somebody in Canberra tangibly re-
membered him.— Warden (Q.).
The Liberal Party
It is nonsense to say that the Liberal
party is at sixes and sevens (B. l/9/’4B).
Whatever our failings, we do present a
strong and united movement functioning
in every State, and well led on Parliamen-
tary and organisational levels by two great
Australians in R. G. Menzies and R. G.
Casey.
Division of forces, lack of finance, and
want of a literature have been the greatest
handicaps the non-socialist political
forces have had to bear for this past
generation. It is the Liberal party’s object
to remedy these weaknesses, and the
hardest task of all is to persuade citizens
with literary talent to reply to the constant
stream of socialistic publications which
commenced with the Fabian Society tracts
from the Webbs, Shaw and others 50
years ago and continue with the Laskis
of today.
In 1945 the Liberal party amalgamated
14 political organisations and has since
consolidated that amalgamation. The
Country, party will not join forces with us,
although the overwhelming majority of
those who are opposed to socialism want
to see one party. Should the Liberal party
in such circumstances vacate the country
districts, or make a series of bargains
under which the Country party and the
Liberal party agree to vacate certain
areas and, in doing so, betray the prin-
ciples for which each party professes to
stand?
At two general elections the country
people have had their choice between
Liberal- and Country-party candidates.
They are accustomed to it, and they vote
for the candidate they prefer. There is no
other solution to the problem until the
time comes when the two parties unite,
and come that time will.
As to your gibe upon policy: The
Liberal party’s policy on taxation, public
expenditure, production, trade relations,
industrial harmony, defence and the rest
has been forthrightly stated again and
again. It has been stated in policy
speeches at one Federal and six State
general elections, and each policy speech
is on record.
Our eyes are already on the future, and
we are making towards our goal. We
shall endorse our candidates in both city
and country as the foundation upon
which a great national party will be built
to confront socialism and its ally, Com-
munism. —W. H. Spooner (president,
N.S.W. Division of the Liberal party).
A clear-cut and unified statement from
Liberal- and Country-party spokesmen
(B. l/9/’4B) is very necessary. I took an
active interest in the Eden-Monaro cam-
paign at the last Federal election, and the
varying expressions of policy from two
Country-party candidates, a Liberal-party
man and an outsider in the Services party
were most disconcerting. On such
matters as reduction of taxation each
party had a different story, so that electors
became confused and Labor was able to
make some telling arguments.
Further, Liberal- and Country-party
candidates came from large grazing in-
terests ; to these the smaller man on the
land has a deep-seated antipathy—shared
in some degree by a percentage of city
middle-class, . voters. Although the
Liberal-party man was a soldier with an
outstanding record, he was not exactly
the man to attract maximum support.
His campaign was not conducted with the
“Not so high , Granny; these post-war models cant take it!”
vigor that is necessary in dealing with
Labor. R. G. Menzies was right when he
said “Certain horses are required for
certain courses,” and up to date Fraser’s
criticism of Labor, while always with
them, has suited the floating voter in this
part of the State, and will continue to
attract adherents from sections of the
community outside of his own party.
The Liberal party might have won
Eden-Monaro had there been only one
candidate against Labor.
If Labor’s opposition wants to win the
next election it must select the right type
for each electorate, avoid overlapping,
and submit a policy which clearly shows <
the electors what to expect in the way of
industrial affairs, defence, social legisla-
tion, transport, development of primary
and secondary industries, simplification
of income-tax procedure and a foreign
policy closely allied with Great Britain. •
Merely mentioning bank nationalisation

White Australia
A welcome to babies and migrants (B.
8/9/’48)? Babies and married migrants
need homes; so do single migrants if they
are to marry and have families. Many
single Australians are postponing
marriage because they are homeless, and,
for the same reason, married couples
either limit their families or have none at
all.
Many couples who might have survived
a normal married life cannot hold to-
gether in the strained atmosphere of over-
crowded quarters in someone else’s home.
With thousands of Australians waiting
desperately for houses, migrants are
naturally regarded with suspicion.
The first essential to increasing our
population is a steady supply of reason-
ably-priced homes. They need not be
elaborate so long as they give adequate
shelter and enough space for a family.
But they will have to be built soon and
quickly to be of much use to the present
generation of young couples. Women
grow old quickly.— Kimat (S.A.).
Nurses
The shortage of trained nurses (B.
8/ 9 / ’4B) might be attributed to the
number who have married since the war,
or who have gone back to housekeeping
when their husbands were discharged.
If the attractive conditions already pre-
vailing for trainee nurses were advertised
sufficiently, I think more young women
would join the profession. Trainees are
no longer slavies. So-called assistant-
nurses in small private hospitals, often
taking only maternity cases, might be
termed such, but as they are generally
content to be little more than domestic
aids with no intention of gaining a certi-
ficate they cannot be confused with
nurses training in larger hospitals. Nor
can their working conditions be com-
pared with those of the real training
schools. Unfortunately, most people do
not know the difference.
Most hospitals today have far better
accommodation and serve better meals
than many trainees would have in their
own homes. The 40-hour week has
eliminated much overtime because of in-
creased staffs. In the last 10 years so
many reforms have been made for the
good of nurses that, today, theirs is one
of the best professions open to women
until they reach 30. That is the age-limit
at, which they may begin their training.
Discipline has been modified, and only
on rare occasions is it so strict that
trainees will rebel. But it is necessary
where one is dealing with life and death.
And many mothers of young girls doing
their training away from home are
grateful for the watchful eye of a strict
matron and superintendent.
No girl will enter a profession unless
she knows something about it. If the
Government used better publicity in the
campaign for more nurses, setting out
the advantages, good wages and the fact
that a registered trained nurse has a job
for life if she wishes, there would be
many more attracted to hospital work.
I’ve never thought the profession under-
paid, although in my training days I re-
ceived only half the salary of present
trainees. Accommodation and uniform
are provided—both a big saving. Over-
work does arise, but in no way can the
course of illness be measured by a clock,
and no nurse will deny a few minutes or
even hours if they mean quicker recovery
or comfort to the dying.
No system of force will bring recruits.
We need wider and better advertising of
the good points of nursing, and not the
growls and complaints which appear to
be coming from those who are not
actively engaged in the profession. —
Trained Nurse (Q.).
Competition
For some years our wicker-workers,
many of them blind or otherwise in-
capacitated, have had the home market
to themselves and have been fully em-
ployed. They are now being warned
that most of them are due for the sack
because Chinese basket-work can be
landed here at less than half the cost of
the local article of similar quality.
That is only one example of what will
happen to our other handicrafts as
foreign factories all over the world re-
cover from the war and begin to pour
their cheaper products into our ware-
houses. Australian short hours, high
wages and low output cannot compete
against Oriental or European labor con-
ditions.
We are selling our markets, our jobs
and our prosperity to aliens for a few
hours of leisure, a few shillings of in-
flated currency and the doubtful privilege
of being able to give cheek to the boss.
Every time we raise our wages or reduce
our quota we are swapping our birthright
for “a little more sleep, a little slumber,
a little more folding of the hand? to
sleep.”—A Mess (S.A.).
Sickness Benefit
My cobber, who has long resented the
“Social Service Contribution” tacked on
to his income tax, was considerably
cheered when he caught the measles. He
thought that, at last, he could claim
“sickness benefit,” and get some of his
money back.
Being a bloke who likes to do things
himself, he waited until he was out of
quarantine and fit for work before lodg-
ing his application. Instead of a cheque,
he received a neat little form, headed
“Notice of Rejection of Claim” —on the
ground that he “returned to work before
becoming eligible for benefit.” The regu-
lation governing this little trick reads
“The date of commencement of sickness
benefit is the date the claim is made; or
the seventh day after the day on which
the claimant became incapacitated, which-
ever is the later.”
This catch in the scheme should be
made generally known. However sick
you are, even if your temperature is 106
and you can see death grinning at you
over the foot of the bed, don’t fail to
remind the missus or someone to trot
along pronto and lodge your claim.—
Hist (N.S.W.).
Move Over, Cow
When “G’snatcher” (B. 4/8/’4B) speaks
of that mere hiatus in prosperity as the
Depression he makes me smile. Sixty-
fivers lived their boyhood through the
real depression of the 1890’s, Then there
was no relief work, no dole of 10s. per
week handed out to single men and no
two-weeks work out of three for the
married.
What we got in those days was a
hand-out of soup with a quarter-loaf of
bread, though not from any Government,
but from such organisations as the
W.C.T.U. For those unable to qualify
for the soup handout —one had to have
a reference from some responsible citizen
—there was the “eight-o’clock rush.”
Just after seven each night vans, charit-
ably loaned, would make the round of
city eating-houses, gathering the day’s
cooked scraps. These, after some little
sorting, were dumped on to tables in
some public hall to be devoured by the
hungry mob that never failed to gather.
When I and cobbers took a turn
at humping bluey, we found no
cockies willing to accord accommodation
in barns or even haystacks, or to give
away bags to make into a “wagga,” or to
leave them where they could be stolen,
or even to give a handful of the spuds
boiled for the pigs.
There were so many on the track in
those days that the average cocky felt
inclined to lift down the shotgun every
time a hesitant knock came to the kitchen
door. That’s why, with frost on the
ground, we were glad to move out a cow,
or a flock of sheep just to get the warm,
dry ground where th?y had been lying.
—Gumsucker (W.A.).
The Root of the Matter
The Miners’ Federation opposes em-
ployment of Poles and Balts in the mines,
allegedly because they have been bred
under conditions that prevent them from
having “a democratic working-class out-
look.” What that really means is that
the immigrants, having had first-hand ex-
perience of Communism, are likely to
prove a conservative force in any in-
dustry they permeate. The entry of thou-
sands of them into the coalmining field
would be a threat to the Comrades’ hold
on that key industry. It should be the
policy of the Liberal and Country parties
to secure entrance to the mines and other
key industries of any suitable immigrants
who have cause to hate Communism. —
Tom (N.S.W.).
The shortage of .22 and other ammuni-
tion needed to keep down farm pests is
very strange. During the war we made
all the ammunition necessary, yet now we
cannot produce enough to deal with
rabbits, foxes, dingoes and other animals
which are getting out of hand and seri-
ously affecting the man on the land.—
W. P. T. (N.S.W.).
While paying £3 ss. per cent, for loan
money the Government charges the thrifty
10 per cent, on their own money. The
means test, as now. applied to applicants
for old-age pensions, allows them to
have assets of £5O in addition to the house
they live in. After that' £5O the rate of
pension is reduced by £1 a year for every
£lO of assets, so that an applicant with
£l5O in cash, bonds or other assets has
his pension reduced by £lO a" year. In
other words, the Government charges
him 10 per cent, interest on his or her
own money. It’s certainly the wrong
way to encourage thrift. — Simple Simon
(N.S.W.).
