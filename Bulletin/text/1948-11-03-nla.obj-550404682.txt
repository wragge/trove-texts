WITH THIS MAGNIFICENT EDIFICE SCOTLAND REMEMBERS WORLD WAR I
r pHE SCOTTISH NATIONAL WAR MEMORIAL, com-
memorating those of the Scottish divisions who fell in the war
of 1914-18, takes the form of a shrine and gallery of honour built
as adjuncts to the castle. The shrine, which is the highest building
in Edinburgh, is entirely the work of Scottish artists, and is recog-
nised as the most beautiful and moving war memorial ever to have
been built. The keynote of the building is harmony, and it is
difficult to believe that it is not the work of one genius able to work
with equal ease in stone, bronze and glass.
The Hall of Honour has a barrel-vaulted roof supported by
octagonal columns which form bays, each devoted to two of the
twelve Scottish infantry regiments with inscribed and carved
panels. The shrine, beneath a lofty sculptured archway, contains
the Stone of Remembrance, which rests upon an outcrop of the
Castle Rock projecting through the marble floor, and bears a steel
casket lined with cedarwood in which are the names of 100,000
Scotsmen who fell during the 1914-18 war.
In the various panels, windows and friezes which adorn the
memorial no detail of service, however humble, has been for-
gotten ; the carrier pigeons, the reluctant mule and even the mice
appear among the reliefs. Nothing that has been done to com-
memorate the war can compare for poignancy and exactitude with
this parade of Scotland’s sons and daughters, and the Shrine is a
requiem and a hymn of praise. The memorial, which was opened
in 1927, was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer.

PATTERNS OF QUEENSLAND
If the Commonwealth Government
were thinking of commissioning an artist
to paint its possessions in the Antarctic —
and it would not be a bad idea —they
could hardly make a better choice than
the Queensland artist Kenneth Mac-
queen: which may be taken both as a
tribute to the distinctive quality of Mac-
queen’s art and a criticism of its limita-
tions.
In the book of his paintings published
by Legend Press, Sydney, under the title
Kenneth Macqueen, Vida Lahey says in
a short biographical foreword that the
artist is a farmer on the Darling Downs:
a region about as far removed from the
South Pole in color, temperature and
scenery as the earth could provide. The
fact remains that Macqueen’s paintings,
especially of sky and sea, look frozen —
not with that kind of coldness which
chills the spirit and proclaims that art is
absent, but clamped into patterns hard,
dramatic and motionless.
The clouds in the watercolor entitled
“Mackerel Sky” are not soft and
luminous vapor but brittle fragments of
ice. The waves in “Coolum Beach” and
“Afternoon Tide,” arrested in the moment
of turning, are ice-floes that will take a
year to reach the shore. The billows of
“Sandhills and Sea,” erect like “pressure-
ice” in bottle-green ridges, will lapse into
the sea again only when the sun melts
them.
These curious, frozen patterns are one
of the peculiar attractions of Kenneth
Macqueen’s art, and, if the paintings are
to be regarded simply as decorations, they
are excellent. But there is no mystery
in a decoration, no life ; there is form but
not vision; and one wonders whether
these watercolors fully satisfy Macqueen’s
own requirements for a work of art. He
writes about his paintings, in a pleasant
monologue accompanying the color-
plates, in the most admirable spirit:
Art should be simple; not necessitating
a specially-trained mind to understand the
idiom. There is so much that is incom-
prehensible and technical in mankind’s
activities today—surely art should not be
so My sole desire is that the picture
produce in the beholder, myself preferably,
a renewal of the elation caused by the
subject.
Macqueen sounds here like Words-
worth defining the process by which lyric
poetry is written; “emotion recollected in
tranquillity.” But in a good many of the
paintings the elation is missing. Between
the inspiration and the execution some-
thing different from tranquillity has inter-
vened: an obsession with mere pattern.
The elation has been clamped into a
formula: something pleasing in itself,
technically adroit, containing enough of
the original elation to make the painting
art as well as decoration, but still a
formula. It is possible that the explana-
tion of this cooling-off lies in the fact that
Macqueen, as he goes on to say, does all
his paintings in the studio, working from
a pencil-sketch made on the spot. A good
many landscapists, particularly oil-
painters, do the same thing; but Mac-
queen’s medium of watercolor calls for
a freshness and a spontaneity that are
often best secured by working direct from
nature.
There is evidence for this, perhaps, in
the fact that Macqueen’s landscapes, on
the whole, are less rigidly patterned than
his seascapes. His farm, he says, where
he works with his brother (who in his
spare time is an entomologist), is 200
miles from the sea ; and, having his sub-
jects continually under his eye, even if he
goes to “the painting-room” to work on
them, his landscapes are, metaphorically
speaking, about 200 miles closer to the
Queensland earth than his seascapes are
to the turbulent reality of the sea. Mac-
queen writes about his landscapes:
I try in my work to express the joy
of living Australia is not a sinister
country, nor is she harsh. Her bush is not
drab. It is full of gaiety if one will
trouble to seek. She has her grim moods;
but so have most lands—many of them
more grim by far —and there is always the
glory of her skies, and when she smiles it
is of a transcending beauty. I feel that so
many of us have got our country all wrong;
and I speak as one who has suffered from
droughts and fire and a host of other hard-
ships of the countryman—upon which we
are rather apt to dwell.
It is a sound and, when the fashion in
landscape painting is for erosion and
rotten stumps, a courageous manifesto,
and the paintings do, in spite of their
limitations, convey the “joy of living” and
the beauty of the earth that Macqueen
has tried to express.
Some of the reproductions, if memory
serves correctly, do not fully do him
justice. “The Waterhole,” exhibited a
year or two ago in Sydney, was a delicate
piece of watercolor in which soft greys
gave mystery to the distance and to the
kangaroos; it is still attractive in repro-
duction, but the kangaroos and a gum-tree
in the foreground have come out a bright
and astonishing blue. And it is doubtful,
surely, that the cows in “Bringing in the
Cows” and the tree in “Red Gum” were,
in the originals, quite so uncompromis-
ingly red. Were there not in “Young
Wheat Crop,” besides the pattern of
furrows and the ring barked trees (painted
for their delicacy instead of as images of
decay), light, distance and atmosphere to
give this harmonious landscape its full
measure of pastoral charm?
Whether it is because of lack of sub-
tlety in the other reproductions or whether
it is simply that Howard Hinton picked
the best, the outstanding landscapes in
the book are two from the Armidale
Teachers’ College, “Sinking the Tank”
and “Week-end Camp,” which, with its
flood of light among heavy foliage, has a
freshness lacking in the formal decora-
tions. “Billabong,” though again the blue
is suspiciously blue, is another attractive
plate.
The volume is bound in a golden cloth
and prihted on good paper, with 17 color-
plates and, in addition to Vida Lahey’s
foreword, an appreciation by Professor
J. V. Duhig. Eleven hundred copies have
been printed.
Painters' Recipes.
In writing Notes on the Technique of
Painting (Faber), artist Hilaire Hiler has,
as he says, taken as a model the written
wisdom appertaining to another noble
art:
I should like this book to be like a good
cookery book, as practical and as simple
to follow. A good cook does not use secret
nostrums or patent preparations if he can
help it. I don’t believe a painter should
either, but if you wish to make a Chinese
dish you would have to use soya sauce
Metaphorically, Hiler instructs the
artist not only how to use soya sauce, but
how to grow the beans and, for an
aperitif, gives some information about
germination and history; and yet he
accomplishes all this without losing sight
of his ideal of practical simplicity.
Among hosts of recipes pure and simple,
set out as "
2oz. rectified turpentine;
Boz. oil of spike; and
20oz. copal varnish, by measure
there are intriguing scraps of historical
information thrown off, as it were, in-
cidentally.
Under the heading “Dust,” for instance,
one learns that Gerard Dou, the 17th-
century artist who painted the Femme
hydropique, was so afraid of the effect of
dust on his painting that he never allowed
anyone to come into his studio, and is
alleged to have made his own entry
through a trapdoor in the ceiling ; then,
■ having entered, he sat for 15 minutes
before his picture, allowing the dust time
to settle.
On page 197 Hiler draws upon a Byzan-
tine recipe for a wax-emulsion process,
on page 199 he quotes Pliny on encaustic
painting and, on the next page, mentions
that according to ancient writers the en-
caustic paintings of Polygnotus were in
perfect condition 900 years after they
were painted. Then—with the usual
accompaniment of exact recipes—Hiler
draws upon modern chemical analysis.
All this is interesting and readable and,
within the narrow field of specialised in-
terest, valuable; there is a wealth of
patiently acquired knowledge behind the
clearly-presented facts. But it is, of
course, technical. The most stimulating
passages are, by the nature of the book,
fragmentary. A happy phrase with which
Hiler, concluding an account of the in-
fluence of the Renaissance on technique,
summarises the incidence of genius in
his profession:
The idea of genius, so stressed by nine-
teenth-century romanticism, has been kept
alive, probably very largely for commercial
reasons; but, as far as most of us are
concerned, statistics would show that we
have more chance of being struck by light-
ning than of ever attaining to it.
Writing on the care of paintings, Hiler
expresses himself intemperately. Damage
is caused, he states, by carelessness in the
studio or by “the barbarous, callous and
stupid treatment” of middlemen and
spectators:
Dilettantes scratch the varnish with their
fingernails to see “how it is”; they wet
little patches with alkaline saliva, often
plentifully supplied with tobacco-juice. At
every opportunity the first-cpmer, who is
asked to look after the picture’s welfare,
puts another coat of varnish on it
And, he shrewdly observes, not all this
vandalism is caused by ignorance.
“France, the country in which everyone
is interested in painting, is the most
dangerous one in the world for unpro-
tected pictures.”
Regarding the Renaissance, Hiler sees
it as a period when, with a prodigious
flowering of individual genius, technique,
in the material sense, began to decline.
He sees that decline perpetuated in the
Paris studio of a young lady from
America, a student on a scholarship from
one of America’s famous academies, who
incautiously invited him to look over her
equipment:
....three venerable and threadbare
specimens of what were once cheap hogs’-
hair brushes that at some indeterminate
date had perhaps been washed She had
never heard of sable brushes, did not know
that varnish could be mixed with oil and
turpentine, and often painted on unprimed
canvas.
But, on the other hand, Hiler writes
respectfully of French house-painters,
whose traditions, he states, date —“at
least” —as far back as the. Middle Ages.
And this —a certain down-to-earth
honesty which disdains no useful know-
ledge, blending with his rage for the
“barbarians and fools” who blaspheme
art, and a certain tolerant scorn for those
persons who “might have made good
handicraftsmen” if they had not been
freed by machinery and entered the
domains of the plastic and graphic arts —
gives a vitality to the book.
If Hiler attempted a book on the wider
subject of art and criticism, it should have
even greater value. There is insight in
his linking of a modern scorn for tech-
nique with industrial development, with
commercial interests and with a “level-
ling” philosophy. And in any case there
is something irresistibly attractive about
an artist who has the humor and honesty
to compare genius to a stroke of
lightning. Modern art criticism has pre-
sented a plethora of pseudo-geniuses, but
it needs an application of the same
analytical and creative faculties which
Hiler shows —in vehement flashes —in
Notes on the Technique of Painting to
sort the real from the false ; and for those
multitudes unsmitten by the divine fire,
there can be surely no more harm in
mastering the tools of creation than in
a poet’s learning how to spell.
New MacNeice Poems.
The most successful verses in Louis
MacNeice’s Holes in the Sky (Faber) are
a group of satirical and analytical pieces
—“Autolycus,” “Elegy for Minor Poets,”
“The Drunkard” —in which the technique
is under control and the poet is not
attempting more than, in an expanded
form, the epigram.
But if one looks for more than this —
and poetry, surely, has something to do
with beauty, with wonder and vision and
delight—the poems that matter most are
MacNeice’s impressions of the landscape.
There are not many of these, but “The
Strand” and “Last Before America” are
beautifully written, and “Cyclist,” though
looser in style, gives a delightful picture
of, summer. In “The Strand,” under the
influence of Yeats —a poem to be con-
trasted with the self-conscious “Littoral”
—he achieves a sureness of thought and
technique:
My father, who for all his responsibly compiled
Account books of a devout, precise routine
Kept something in him solitary and wild,
So loved the western sea and no tree’s green
Fulfilled him like these contours of Slievemore
Menaun and Croaghaun and the bogs between.
For the rest, the chief impression the
book makes is of muddle ; muddled tech-
nique, muddled thought; a groping to-
wards a new outlook. MacNeice’s tech-
nical failings are surprising in a poet of
his capacity and reputation. Even in a
ballad a line such as
Perplexed by the dicta misfortunes inspire
is a descent into doggerel; and if, as in
the loose and rambling “Western Land-
scape”—“ln ddggerel and stout let me
honour this country”—the poet confesses
his descent, that in no way alters the fact
of it. “Western Landscape,” because it
is one of the Irish poems, does contain
some effective poetry:
The curragh went over the wave and dipped
in the trough
When that horny-handed saint with the abstract
eye set off
Which was fourteen hundred years ago—maybe
never —
And yet he bobs beyond the next high crest
for ever.
Feeling;
Sea met sky, he had neither floor nor ceiling,
The rising blue of turf-smoke and mountain
were left behind.
Blue neither upped nor downed, there was blue
all round the mind.
Emotion:
One thought of God, one feeling of the ocean,
Fused in the moving body, the unmoved soul,
Made him part of a not to be parted whole.
But it also contains, along with “Our too
human skeins of wish” (a Freudian
catchword repeated in many of the
verses'), the line;
And docking the queues of the teetotum
consciousness—
which would not do credit to Era Malley.
Among other technical blemishes—
amidst the general looseness that mars
the cheerful “National Gallery”—there is
an unfortunate reference to the poet’s
heart as a magnetic mine, and some of
those mouthfuls of hyphenated adjectives
which Dylan Thomas, after Hopkins, has
brought into fashion:
Not intervolution of wind-rinsed plumage
of oat-field...
The faults are not the result of in-
capacity but of uncertainty and self-
consciousness. MacNeice attempts to re-
vive his old attitudes of thought, his old
styles of technique in some of the poems:
the grim revolutionary jauntiness and
ballad style of his captivating “Bagpipe
Music” in “The Streets of Laredo” and
“Slum Song,” the flowing philosophical
style of “Autumn Journal” in “The
Stygian Banks”; but the ballads are
feeble and the Stygian banks are strewn
with a most monstrous confusion of tor-
tured images and mixed metaphors. “The
Streets of Laredo,” a poem on the bomb-
ing of London, has some moments of
amusing balladry—
Then out from a doorway there sidled a
cockney,
A rocking chair rocking on top of his head:
“O fifty-five years I been feathering my
love-nest
And look at it now—why you’d sooner be
dead.”—
—but MacNeice is unable elsewhere to in-
fuse into the comedy the strain of grim-
ness it needs, and the poem ends tamely
and lamely, without conviction. “Slum
Song” is weak throughout.
Safari Sally.
In her Sally in Rhodesia, Sheila Mac-
Donald proved years ago that she could
write about Africa as though it slept
under her pillow. Tanganyika Safari
(Angus and Robertson) has just the same
intimate, chuckling tone.
The author states on the first page that
she has never been bored in her life. One
can easily believe it. In any case it would
be difficult to be bored on a buffalo-
hunting safari. On the way to Lushoto
by station-wagon, camp was pitched on
a high escarpment. Shivering with cold
in the tent, Mrs. MacDonald dozed off
just before dawn. She woke to a
muffled bellowing:
“Lions—lions,” I shouted to F.J., who
was awake on the instant and reaching for
his rifle. We both sat up, listening intently.
The bellowing came again. “There it is,”
I said in a shaky whisper. F.J. gave me a
withering look and, replacing his rifle, lay
back in bed and dragged his rug closer
round him. “That’s a cow calving in some
blasted Hun’s shamba,” he said tersely, and
added accusingly, “I’d only just got off to
sleep.”
Travelling round the foothills of Kili-
manjaro, there is naturally much country
that lends itself to enthusiastic description.
One hot afternoon camp was pitched on
the shores of Lake Manyara. No sooner
is the tent up than Mrs. MacDonald
pitches into the scene before it:
Imagine our tent in the shade of two
spreading acacia-trees. More trees to the
right and left of us. Forest behind, and
in front a sweep of short, sun-bleached
grass, reaching down to a deep blue, very
still sheet of lake, fringed along the whole
of its shallow depths with a rose-pink flush
of countless thousands of flamingoes, stand-
ing motionless like gigantic pink water-
lilies, gazing fixedly down into the trans-
lucent blue. Near to them flocks of white
egrets, circling and swooping and calling
and beating up again into the dazzling
sunshine on spread white wings, or alighting
in a drift of snowy white on the swaying
reeds of a papyrus swamp that seeped
greenly out into the still, blue water.
Throughout the book there are adven-
tures with lions, rhinos and elephants, all
of which increase one’s respect for the in-
habitants of Taronga Park and for Sheila
MacDonald as a travel-writer.
Nearly half of Arabian Days, an auto-
biography by H. St. John P. Philby
(Hale), concerns days in India. Mr.
Philby rates almost half a page
in Who’s Who. So he is a reasonably
famous explorer, and part, at least, of
his life must have been exciting; but it
requires considerable imagination to per-
ceive it from his book.
’Neath Austral Skies: W. Beard (J.
Bell and Co.). Mr. Beard declares that
he is trying to get back to the wholesome
Victorian period, and that he makes no
apology for the introductory poem to
each chapter. He gives a rough idea of
what he means in his initial verse:
That deepens the hue of the bluebells erect,
As they flower with such a regal effect.
Ralph, the hero of the novel, a model to
young manhood, is unaffected by en-
counters with a mosquito-pestered swag-
man who says “d !” and a naughty
girl called Molly whose romantic mind
had been fired “by some grossly exag-
gerated and sensual pictures” she had
seen in Moree.

Under Part II of the Ro-establishment and Employment Act
1945, members and ex-members of the Forces are entitled to
preference in certain circumstances in engagement for
employment. They ako have other special rights—for
example, in relation to housing and tenancy, and moratorium
and re-establishment benefits.
The Commonwealth Attorney-General’s Legal Service Bureau
advises, without charge, on all legal matters affecting service-
men or their dependants. Any member or ex-member of the
Forces who believes he has not been given the treatment to

Details concerning Perkin Warbeck,
a fiffeenth-century pretender to the
English Crown ?
The son of a Flanders Jew, he
claimed to be Richard, Duke of York,
supposed to have been murdered in
the Tower, and therefore entitled to
the throne in preference to its then
occupant, Henry VII. The Duchess of
Burgundy and Charles VIII of France
and James IV of Scotland gave him
their countenance, and Warbeck was
enabled in 1497 to appear in Eng-
land at the head of a force of 7000
men. He was easily defeated, tried for
treason and hanged at Tyburn.

How to polish or renew finish on
old cedar furniture ?
Wash each piece of furniture with
warm sodawater—-half-cup washing
soda in one gallon warm water, then
rinse off and wipe carefully after-
wards, drying in shade. When bone-
dry apply raw linseed oil sparingly
and rub in well, doing small area at a
time and polishing as you go. Any
furniture cream or wax can be used
for a finish, but raw oil and elbow-
grease are usually sufficient.

How to treat calendula plants
affected with rust ?
Cut off all badly-affected leaves and
burn them, then dust the plants with
flowers of sulphur or spray them with
lime-sulphur (one part in 50 parts ot
water) twice a week. If these
measures are not effective dig out
the plants, soak the soil with strong
permanganate of potash solution and
leave the area fallow for at least a
month before restocking with phlox,
nemesia, dianthus or plants not sub-
ject to the disease.

Australia's security from foes
without and want within rests on
her industrial capacity. The com-
bined production plants of C.D.D.
contribute greatly to Australia's
industrial security by making
the steel bodies and chassis com-
ponents for Chrysler, Dodge, De
Soto and Plymouth cars and
Dodge and Fargo trucks. But the
C.D.D. plants are equipped, as
their war record proves, to swing
swiftly and efficiently into much
wider fields when needed.

IS DOGS SOLDIERS?
BY CECIL MINN
“i I I E’S my dog,’ the Doctor says,”
j \ Larry told Bella. “ ‘He’s my
I I dog an’ nobody else’s’ ”
“The pointer?” said Bella.
“He turns his glass upside-down on the
counter,” said Larry.
“Huh,” said Bella.
“It was empty,” said Larry. “He turns
it upside-down, an’ he says, ‘He’s goin’t’
die a soldier's death,’ he says”
“He muster been full—as usual,” said
Bella.
“He’s goin’t’ the war,” said Larry.
“A fat lot he’d do at the war,” said
Bella.
“Aw, I dunno ; it don’t foller,” said
Larry. “He was at the last war.”
“An’ took good care he come back,”
said Bella.
“Some’s got t’ come back, haven’t
they?” said Larry. “Returned soldiers.”
“Like your brother Bill,” said Bella.
“He come back none the worse, too.”
“Except he had a wife,” said Larry.*
1 < y ES, poor woman,” said Bella.
I “He’s goin’ again,” said Larry.
“One ain’t enough?” said Bella.
“He reckons he might as well,” said
Larry. “He reckons he went to one war
an’ he’s been fightin’ ever since.”
•“I know where he'll do his fightin’,”
said Bella. “An’ Dr. McCabe, too.”
“It don’t foller,” said Larry. “A
woman can’t understand. It’s a war. I’d
go meself.”
“You’d get a long way with your glass-
eye. Even,” said Bella, breaking it down
a bit, “if you are the best shot on the
River. They don’t have nobody with
glass-eyes—*-Dr. McCabe’d tell y’ that.”
“I’d do as well as some of them, any-
how,” said Larry.
“A damn’ sight better, if you asks me,”
said Bella. “Dr. McCabe, puffin’ an’
blowin’ like a grampus just cornin’ up our
few, steps.”
“He turns his glass upside-down,” said
Larry, “an’ he says, ‘Larry Bronowski,’
he says, ‘you’re the best gunshot on the
River, bar none’ ”
“Well, so you is,” said Bella,
“I’m tryin’ t’ tell y’,” said Larry.
“ ‘You’re the best gunshot on the River,
an’ I wouldn’t trust nobody else,’ he says.
‘You’ll take him out to the quail paddocks
at dawn,’ he says. ‘At dawn, Larry,’ he
says, ‘an’ give him a soldier’s death an’
a soldier’s burial,’ ”
“The beer talkin’,” said Bella.
“He was upset proper,” said Larry.
“ ‘Shoot him at dawn, Larry,’ he says,
‘an’ bury him,’ ” •
“The beer talkin’,” said Bella. “Is dogs
soldiers?”
“Is dogs soldiers?” said Larry.
“Well,” said Bella, “is they?”
LARRY had no answer for that. In
fact, he had no answer after turning
it over for close on three days. He might
never have found an answer at all if it
wasn’t for what the elephants did to him.
What the elephants did was make Larry
laugh, which some had said couldn’t be
done. A bit unfair, that. He could
laugh all right, at the right sort of things.
Such as the elephants.
Larry saw them from where he’d been
working with his hoe and spade and
rake, finishing the bean-planting down
near the foot of the slope where the River
loafs past in its horseshoe bend round
the Town. There they were, five of them,
one big elephant and four a bit smaller,
standing upside-down in the River waving
their trunks in the clouds.
You didn’t expect to see things like that
in the River. Hardly. Horses and cows
reflected along the green banks, yes. But
not elephants.
Somewhere down inside him, where he
kept it, the elephants found Larry’s sense
of humor and tickled it with their trunks.
He burst out laughing. There was no
mere chuckling about it. He leaned on
his hoe and laughed till the tears filled
even his glass-eye.
The elephants belonged to a travelling
circus, so raising a laugh wouldn’t, in the
ordinary way, be anything very remark-
able for them, being in the nature of their
profession. JBut, even though they did do
it with a trick, getting a laugh out of
Larry was at least an unusual achieve-
ment. It put the elephants in the class
of the few other original comedians who,
at odd times, had brought off the same
hilarious feat.
ALL of those others, too—like the
elephants paddocked for the day on
the riverbank—virtuosi, so to speak, of
the open air. The cocky little willy-wag-
tail Larry saw one day fly fair on to a
hovering hawk’s back and go for an
aeroplane ride, looping the loop and
doing stunts planes never thought of, still
hanging on away up over the top of the
big box-tree and near out of sight before
it had hopped off and come back in a
nose-dive to its nest in the thorn-hedge by
the pig-s,ty.
Or those fish the last flood had caught
napping ; going right past just there in the
River with their heads stuck up out of
the fresh water, opening and shutting
their mouths as if they were talking. Or
Larry’s own pet crow, up to his thieving
tricks; coming in from Mrs. Hanley’s,
next door, with a plait of false ginger
hair in his bill.
Yes, each of these also had made Larry
laugh. But his laugh at the elephants
performed another sort of miracle. As
if his thinking had been taken out by it
and washed, it cleared away enough of
the puzzlement to let him reach a de-
cision. Even planting the beans had been
part of putting that off. Too hard a thing
for Larry, unassisted, to decide on. To
go along to Dr. McCabe’s and say, “I’ve
come for the dog, Doctor. You wanted
me to shoot him.” And so find out
whether it had been only the beer talking.
The Doctor —Larry thought more
about him as he went back up r the slope
to the house. Always a great one for the
Soldiers’ Memorial, and putting flowers
on the statue and making speeches. What
if he did take a drop, thought Larry,
going out the gate and along the road to
the Doctor’s. He was a damn’ sight better
than the others, anyhow, even if Bella
wouldn’t have him at any price. Where
was the others, thought Larry, when the
snake bit young Jim. Out playin’ flamin’
golf, that’s where they was. One thing
about the Doctor, thought Larry, you
always knew where to find him. But he’d
be home by now —they was shut.
WHEN he rang the bell and the Doctor
came out, Larry could see they’d
been giving it a bit of a lash again. Still
celebrating. You could always tell with
the Doctor—apart from him switchin’ on
the verandah light this time in the after-
noon.
“Yes, Larry? What’s the trouble?”
“I come for the dog, Doctor.”
“You’ve come for the dog?”
“You know,. .a Wednesday.”
“Wednesday? Wednesday? Let me
see now”
She was right an’ no mistaking thought
Larry. The beer talkin’. He was ready
to say it, “You wanted me to shoot him,
as you’re goin’ to the war,” when the
Doctor remembered.
“That’s right, Larry old fellow,” he
said. “Come for the dog. This way.
Down the steps. Round the back.”
The Doctor stumbled, bumping his foot
against the side of the path, leading the
way round. He don’t seem to remember
even now, thought Larry ; but taking hold
of the end of the chain.
“You wanted me t’ shoot him,
Doctor?”
“Hector,” said the Doctor, bending
down and taking a scruff of the pointer’s
neck. “It’s au revoir, mate. Yes, au
revoir. Hector old fellow. A soldier’s
death, mate. Do your duty, Larry.”
Larry went back with a picture of the
Doctor straightening his tubby form,
squaring his shoulders, and stumbling in-
side over the top step.
ON his own back step, with the light
from the kitchen window shining into
the yard,, Larry sat for a while looking at
the dog. Lying there with its head on its
paws, like a statue. Class all over it. Not
fretting. Not even letting on it was aware
of the other dogs, Larry’s, a bit further
down the fence, above the pig-sty. Dif-
ferent from his. Imported. Lighter.
Finer in the front legs, an’ the head.
You’d get some good pups out of him an’
Trixie. Worth a bit, too.
What he was committed to do didn’t
stop Larry going to sleep at once when
he got to bed. That’s what beds was for.
HE woke in the morning an hour be-
fore dawn, as if he’d set an alarm
for the purpose. Waiting outside the
kennel the dog gave him a welcome,
twisting its clean tan-and-white body with
pleasure and swishing its tail in the
mousey light. Letting Larry know it
was pleased to be there and pleased to
see him.
Both the rifle and spade gripped in one
hand, Larry unsnipped it from the chain.
They went out round the side of the
house and across the dew-wet grass to
the gate. Getting through, the fence across
the road he saw the light switched on,
and knew Bella was awake.
As they went on across country, mak-
ing for the quail paddocks, the dog
trotted alongside him, its head just in
front of the slanted barrel. The light
mist, lying over the lower paddocks, was
beginning to lift and drift away through
the trees, taking some of the darkness
with it.
They were beginning to skirt round
the swamp, Larry puzzled afresh ; trying
now to plan something. How to shoot
the dog when they got out there to the
quail paddocks, round the other side of
the swamp. As far as that went, he could
easily shoot it now, without raisin’ the
rifle. Just press? the trigger. Just in be-
hind the tan ears. Y’ couldn’t miss.
But about givin’ it a soldier’s death.
He wouldn’t mean no shootin’ it like that
in the back of the head.
Larry’s thoughts took a remarkable
leap. Would he mean blindfold with
their backs up against a wall an’ a firin’
squad? You couldn’t start doin’ that;
not with no dog. It’d take a tumble all
right if you started any blindfoldin’
business. This fellow would, anyway.
He must have meant some other way.
Soldiers chargin’ the enemy and gettin’
shot dead as they went. You couldn’t
do that, though, with this sort of dog.
Not with any sort of pointer you couldn’t
do that, let alone one like this fellow. It
wouldn’t go chargin’ at nothin’, whatever
it was. Not like a mong. You could do
it with a mong, all right.
Larry took a fair time thinking all that
out. They were coming now to the quail
country, and he could see the dog watch-
ing him. Its straight front legs stepping
high through the longish grass. A dim
idea struck Larry. That’d be the way, all
right. Send it on ahead, an’ when it made
a point, standin’, stretchin’ forward, with
a front paw bent —that’d be what he
meant.
He gave a low whistle. He didn’t know
what words the dog worked but this
one wouldn’t need no words. It’d under-
stand, anyway. It’d be a jump ahead of
you.
He dug the spade into the ground and
spoke to the dog. “Hector. Here. Right,
boy.” He waved his free armi in an arc
and the dog was off. Swift, alert; be-
ginning to work the tussocks in widen-
ing arcs. Missing nothing.
LARRY watched it, waiting. He slipped
a cartridge into the ’32, His eyes
narrowed ; wrinkled in. Anyone could
have picked which was the glass-eye. It
was the more human one.
Clear dawn now all over the quail pad-
docks, though the sun was still to come
up; reddening now on the long cloud
drifts.
Out in the clear ahead the dog had
slowed down to a stealthy walk. It
stopped now. Larry had the rifle part-
lifted.
That dog, thought Larry, what the
hell’s up with him? He ain’t pointin’
nothin’. He’s crouchin’ back. He’s
scared.
“A flamin’ snake,” said Larry aloud.
“That’s what it is—a flamin’ snake.”
He left the spade standing in the
ground and went on swiftly. The dog
still crouching back ; he could see its lip
curled up from its teeth, snarling.
Larry was up with the dog before he
saw what it was. Then, for the second
time in 24 hours Larry laughed. His
laugh brought a short bark out of the
pointer, laughing, too.
STRETCHED in the grass, the old red
sow opened her top eye and looked
at them. She didn’t move. Worn from
her night’s labors, she lay there with the
vast litter suckling their first breakfast.
It meant nothing to her that she had
joined those other earthy comedians, the
wagtail, the talking fish, the thieving
parrot and the five elephants. Or, yet,
that she and her litter were as good as in
Larry’s sty.
“Come on,” said Larry to the dog.
“Well get Bella to help us.”
The dog, trotting along, took the spare
wrist in his mouth; a comedian, too.
Larry in great good humor as well. Even
thinking of a joke. Go in and say “You
was wrong, Bella. He’s the same as Bill
—a returned soldier.”
The Blands of Paka Puki
By F. L. COMBS
TODAY in Paka Puki they have a
pharmaceutical chemist by exam,,
and he wears a white jacket and, if
you, too, are scientific, talks to you
in quite a scientific way about carbon
compounds and precipitates and cata-
lysers. It is a good thing that if he is
absent his young man who keeps on fail-
ing in his pharmaceutical exams seems
able to fix you up. I suppose he follows
his employer’s explicit scientific direc-
tions.
I miss the magnificent magenta and
blue phials from the window of the estab-
lishment (not shop) as T, Bland used to
keep it. Of course they are in the way
with all the new remedies in neat hygienic
packages and phials that have now to be
displayed. There is nothing you can ask
for that the new man does not have, even
including old-fashioned tonic remedies,
which Tim Delanty the roadman still
takes in regular monthly quart bottles.
One thing, however, has not chahged.
It is the prescription-room where all the
mysterious things the doctor orders in
his mysterious handwriting- are mysteri-
ously dispensed. It is, as in most chemists’
establishments, a passage five, feet wide
by nine feet long, the sort of confined
space lacking which chemists pharma-
ceutical or otherwise would be unable to
work. You see the reason? They need
everything close to hand.
As an old-timer myself, it is the old
chemist, not the new one, that interests me
most. His name was Thorold Bland. He
was (like myself also) a man with one
of those sudden abdomens, and there was
nearly always half an inch between the
bottom of his waistcoat and the top of
his trousers. He never wore the white
jackets that are so hygienic. On the
contrary, he used to come out of the pre-
scription department to attend to you in
a ragamuffin coat bearing on it the marks
of years of encounters with powerful
drugs such as Ac. sulp. and am. liq. and
aq. For.
THOROLD BLAND was a most like-
able man and something of a liar.
He skited a bit and bluffed a bit. When
he told you, as if to his own surprise, of
his success with his tomatoes he glowed
with naive enthusiasm, and, though you
sensed the hard kernel of egotistical self-
inflation, you shared his pleasure.
As a bluffer he was (at second hand)
always telling people from Arn Mills
down to the new doctor where they got
off. “McKendrick thinks he can knock
me up at any ungodly hour to hustle a
prescription along. He’ll find his mistake.
Where he was last they say the chemist
was his office-boy. He’ll find out, and
pretty soon, that that sort of thing is not
going to go over with T. Bland.”
Or “Arn Mills was in yesterday feeling
me out about giving this sewerage con-
tract to Bill Wills because Will’s is a local
man. I talked to him pretty straight. On
the council we handle the borough’s
money, and the borough’s entitled to
the best offer, as I told Mills in
pretty well those words. He didn’t like
it. He could see I knew all about the
way Wills had helped to swing the pub
vote to him last election. There’s a good
many in Paka Puki think it best to keep
out of Arn Mills’ bad books, especially
now he’s M.P. That was never my way
and never will be.”
As a matter of fact, T. Bland, for all
his self-dramatised vigor and downright-
ness, his uncompromising indifference to
the powers that be in the township, as set
forth in his conversation, was, when it
came to the sticking-poirit, all for peace
at almost any price, as Will Beswick
found to his cost when he relied on him,
to beard the leonine Am Mills over the
River Improvement Scheme. That was a
woeful fade-out.
All the same, T. Bland was likeable,

Our welfare as a nation is directly linked with the condition of
our farm lands. The conservation of soil and water in our
restricted agricultural areas is so urgent a necessity, so vital a
concern of every citizen, that it has become the dominant feature
of the Government’s rural policy. Erosion at a rate faster than
that which caused the U.S.A.’s notorious "dust-bowl” has so
impoverished some districts as to force the abandonment of
once richly producing properties.
Foremost in our Commonwealth plan for soil conservation and
reclamation is "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors, For contour fur-
rowing, grading, irrigation schemes, pasture improvement,
water conservation and reclamation of heavily eroded areas,
whether in the hands of Government instrumentalities or the
progressive man on the land, the most efficient and economical
method is by "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors and Equipment.

THE BATTLE FOR TIME.
A point always made in favor-
able comment on the Berlin air-
lift has been its ability to main-
tain a supply of food and other
essentials to some 2,300,000 Ber-
liners ; not so emphasised is the
fact that it has no hope of
supplying fuel and raw materials
for industry.
On this glossed-over aspect of
the admittedly splendid achieve-
ment, N. Y. “Times” has re-
ported that, with factories clos-
ing down right and left, nearly
100,000 have been unemployed
in Berlin as a direct result of the
Soviet-imposed blockade.
Similarly, in a sensationally
alarming article in “Saturday
Evening Post” touching on pre-
sent Western weakness, Demaree
Bess reports from Germany that
the air-lift “never offered a
final solution of the Berlin con-
troversy, since it is impossible
to supply Berlin’s industry in-
definitely by air,” adding:
“Aside from the fantastic cost-
liness of this operation, it could
—London “News-Chronicle.”
“OKAY. NOW YOU LIFT IT!”
not permanently relieve the Wes-
tern predicament in Berlin, be-
cause the Germans of that city
can earn their living only by
the products of their factories,
and no conceivable air-lift
could transport all the essential
imports and exports.”
That is one of the strains the
makers of the Soviet starvation-
policy plainly count on becom-
ing unbearably severe as the
winter worsens. With the assist-
ance of Communist agitation it
could lead to rioting, “justify-
ing” the Russians in taking com-
plete military control of all Ber-
lin “to preserve order.”
Apart from those unemployed
by the blockade, other Berliners
obviously will be severely tested
before the winter is over. A
few weeks back Mr, Bevin had
to warn them of “new hard-
ships” ahead, when already their
conditions were, by general re-
port, a good deal worse than
those of, say, Britain.
Also, London “Times” Berlin
correspondent, in two recent
articles on this main battle-
ground of the “cold war,” has
stated that even the October
nights and days “brought win-
ter’s chilling touch to many
hearts and homes.” It is “a cal-
culated cruelty” of the Krem-
lin, the “Times” man adds, “that
a Mrd winter may break a spirit
[in the Berliners] which has with-
stood intimidation and open
threats.” The correspondent,
however; believes that, in their
present mood, Berliners will en-
dure even the worse conditions
mentioned by Mr. Bevin rather
than side with Russia.
Meanwhile, the air-lift, by
most reports, has been far from
a dead loss. It has surprised
even the Western side and prob-
ably amazed the Kremlin by
actually increasing the food
stocks in Berlin above what was
held there when the blockade
was first imposed. From a mili-
tary viewpoint it is generally
considered even more worth the
cost, both in the active training
it has provided for Western air-
crews and in the highly import-
ant —it can be called vital —
matter of time.
As reported in N. Y. “Times”
and other U.S. papers, there is
now, based on England and the
Western zones of Germany, at
least a strong enough striking
air force to deliver severe blows
to Soviet industry in the early
stages of any Soviet-launched
war. However, according to the
“Saturday Evening Post” corre-
spondent already quoted, the
Western side is still in very poor
shape, in the air and generally,
to withstand a Russian on-
slaught. “Russian planes in
Germany,” the “Post” corre-
spondent states, “number thou-
sands to our scores, and their
quality is about equal to ours.
Even now the Russians could
drive our little Air Force out of
Germany as quickly as they
could drive out our meagre
ground forces.”
The same correspondent also
reports U.S. air commanders
(presumably those on the spot in
Germany) as being “disturbed
by exaggerated reports of Rus-
sian weakness in the air and of
American strength,” which re-
ports, he states, “present a false
picture of the actual situation.”
The air commanders’ present
problem “is to help hold the line
here [in Germany] so far as that
is possible, while the United
States Air Force is being gradu-
ally rebuilt, literally from the
ground up, after its 1945 dis-
integration. This is bound to be
a slow and laborious process,

tions, however lavish, can-

The correspondent,
who has been reporting on the
Mad Continent since long be-
fore the last war, agrees with
what is the general finding of
all but confirmed optimists:
that, in the event of war, the
Russians, like the Nazis, would
have victories to begin with.
Berlin, at least, would be very
easy. “Militarily,” says the
London “Times” correspondent,
“its position is hopeless. Iso-
jated w ithin the Russian zone,
Western Powers have to de-

continually exercise and change

is reported to be a regular fea-
ture, and there is much talk
among the soldiers of a possible
defensive war, s war was
also defensive. All this may
be no more than a phase of the
‘cold war’ which has long since
been declared. The fate of Ber-
lin will be settled by political
decisions taken in Moscow, and
information available on that
point is not reassuring.”
The weakness of the Western
side, apart altogether Jrom the
merely hopeless position in Ber-
lin, has been bluntly stated by
U.S, Deputy Army Chief-of-
Staff General Collins, who,
while allowing that “the man-
power and industrial potential
of Western Europeans is still
great” and that, “with world-
wide co-operation, there are
daily increases in their strength
to defend themselves,” added:
“At the moment, however, their
domestic problems are so great
that their military potential is
near an all-time low.”
This serious aspect, with what
the U.S. can do to rectify it,
has been thoughtfully dealt with
by Walter Lippmann in N. Y.
“Herald Tribune.” “Even if we
suppose,” says Lippmann, “that
Congress were called into special
session right after election in
order to ratify an alliance, to
authorise and appropriate for
military lend-lease and to im-
pose the industrial controls
needed to manufacture the muni-
tions and equipment, time
would have to pass before Euro-
pean continental armies existed
which could fight an effective
holding operation between the
Elbe and the Rhine.
“During the period of prepa-
ration the defence of Western
Europe would depend, as it does
today, not upon our ability to
hold the Red Army but upon
our ability to deter the Kremlin
from ordering it to march. The
crucial question is whether the
deterrent effect of American air-
and sea-power would be suffi-
cient, or can be made sufficient,
to meet the additional strain
that would be created by serious
measures to arm Western
Europe.
“As things are now, there is a
real though precarious balance
of power which preserves the
peace: Our ability to devastate
the Russian cities is balanced by
the Red Army’s ability to over-
run the cities of Western Europe.
But if effective measures were
taken and completed to arm
Western Europe the balance of
power would have turned radi-
cally against the Russians. Their
cities would still be vulnerable
to the atomic bomb; the Wes-
tern cities would be secure
against the Russian infantry.
“The period when Western
Europe was arming—but not yet
effectively armed —would in-
evitably be one of extreme
danger. The bitterness of the
Russian reaction to the economic
Marshall Plan has been con-
siderable ; against a military
Marshall Plan it would surely
be even more violent, especially
if the formation of a Western
German Government would fol-
low, as many who sponsor it in-
tend, by the re-creation of the
German Army.”
In Lippmann’s view—support-
ing, it can be said, the view
widely held in Western coun-
tries that would be in the direct
line of any Russian march in
Europe—there should be, with-
out waiting for months of
American debate, an immediate
declaration “that any advance
beyond the armistice lines would
be an act of war against the
United States,” this declaration
to be formally confirmed later
by treaty.
That would be especially ap-
plicable to France. Recently,
when some news seeped out of
U.S. dealings with Spain’s
Franco, a London correspondent
of N. Y. “Times” reported:
“What worries some French and
other Continental statesmen is
that the United States’ strategic
plans may be drawn with a view
to making Britain and Spain the
principal Allied bases in Europe
and putting France and the
Benelux countries in an expend-
able category.”
On the same news of U.S.
arrangements with Spain, Lon-
don “Daily Mail” commented
that “The French want to know
whether Spain is to be the
second line of defence—or the
first.”
From all the reports it is
evident that every day that war
has been and can be averted
counts as a day gained by the
Western side —not in preparing
to wage a war but in preparing
a defensive position that will
prevent one, and the nearer to
the Rhine that line can be con-
solidated the more secure will
world peace become.
“No-war” Prophets.
“It is more and more apparent
here [in Washington] that the
Russians do not wish to bring
on war.”
Thus David Lawrence in the
latest N. Y. “Sun” by air-mail.
Lawrence is editor of “U.S.
News and World Report,”
which, as shown in “Uncabled
Additions” quotes, has hitherto
been almost alone in unre-
servedly forecasting there would
be no early war.
Recent air-mails show that
feeling to be spreading. The
sober N. Y. “Times” now states
definitely : “Shooting war is n#t
likely, at least in the near
future.” As another example, a
“Saturday Evening Post” report
from Berlin: “It is now gener-
ally agreed that the period of
greatest danger of imminent war
has passed.”
Malaya Terror.
A recent Chicago “Tribune”
report sent from Melbourne by
Quentin Pope contained this
sweeping accusation:
“The Australians seem not to
know what is going on north of
them.”
Certainly the Chifley Govern-
ment attitude to northern hap-
penings all through—particularly
its handing over of this coun-
try’s foreign policy in that
quarter to waterside Communists
and its tardy and paltry assist-
ance to Britain in Malaya—
makes that accusation hard to
refute. *
In -another Chicago “Tribune”
report from Melbourne Quentin
Pope stated: “The way the Aus-
tralians are sitting on their hands
while the British are using
regular troops to squelch
terrorism in Malaya discloses the
peculiar defence set-up of the
British Empire Since V-J
day there ' has been talk of
‘planned Empire defence’ and of
‘Empire zones.’ But the Malayan
upsurge has shown that there can
be no zonal responsibility, other-
wise action there would have
been an Australian responsibility.
It is true the Aussies have no
army to send to the Malayan
terror spot, since their regular
forces are in Japan, but, they
could use Navy men and planes
to help the British.
“While they have no desire to
see the south-east Asia lands
overrun by Communists, the
Aussies also have no urge to
help maintain British imperialism
there. Their viewpoint was
stated by Prime Minister Ben
Chifley when he said the Asia
problem was not due to Com-
munism alone but went deeper,
and might prove insoluble.
There are 17,000 Europeans in
Malaya, Chifley said, adding : T
do not say it with any feeling,
but a great many of them are
there not from any great love of
the country, but because of the
profits they can make from it.’ •
“So, not wanting to see the
Communists in but not wanting
to aid the British against them,
the Aussies do nothing And
from London correspondent
Douglas Brass has been report-
ing to the Melbourne ‘Herald’
that the English are wondering
as they see their guards and
hussars being issued with jungle
green for Malayan service why
Malaya is not at least partly an
Australian responsibility.”

The following extracts from a
broadcast by Malayan Commis-
sioner-General Malcolm Mac-
Donald help to give a true pic-
ture of the situation in Malaya
and happenings there:

terrorists] have inflicted a heap

peaceful and innocent citizens,
but the rosy prospects of wide
triumph and victory which] they
once conjured up for them-
selves must be fading before
their eyes.” [This claim is sup-
ported by a Reuter special cor-
respondent in Singapore, who
stated in a “Sydney Morning
Herald” report on October 25:
“The Malayan battle has been
won. Chinese Communists who
sought to seize control of the
Empire’s second - best dollar-
earner have lost their hazardous
gamble.”] The MacDonald
broadcast proceeded:—
“Many factors have contri-
buted to the terrorists’ undoing,
the crucial one being the stand
made by the European managers
on mines and plantations. By
their steadfast conduct the
planters have helped greatly to
save Malaya.
“However, the main cause of
the Communists’ failure to de-
velop their strength is that they
did not have the support of the
people.
“The fact is that the peoples
of Malaya are hostile to the
terrorists. From the beginning
of the outbreak almost the whole
Malay population have opposed
them.”
* * * *
“The movement attacking the
Government and people of
Malaya is largely an alien move-
ment. . . .Because they have so
little popular support the Com-
munists dare not come into the
open, set up the standard of re-
volt and appeal to the people to
flock to it. They know that they
would receive no friendly
response.
“So they skulk in the edges
of the jungle and emerge
momentarily when they think it
safe to burn a smoke-house or
assassinate some peaceful citi-
zen. When opposed they never
stand and fight. As soon as
police or troops appear they run
away. They are not soldiers but
murderers. They are not derflo-
crats but petty tyrants.
“They are not' Malayan
Nationalists but international
Communists. They are agents of
foreign interests and Powers.”
*—* * *
“The force of our counter-
attack against the terrorists is
gaining weight with every week
that passes. The latest arrivals
to augment it are the Guards
Brigade. It is significant of the
British Government’s determina-
tion to fulfil its obligation to
protect the people of the Federa-
tion that whilst the Berlin crisis
is at its peak and Europe is filled
with thunderous rumors of war
they have sent this most famous
fighting unit to Malaya.
“Nevertheless, the complete
overthrow of the enemy will still
be a difficult and slow process.
Although their numbers are not
great, and the support which
they receive is limited, condi-
tions in the Malayan jungle and
countryside are favorable to
protracted resistance by armed
gangs of desperate men.”
* * * *
“The gunmen’s leaders can-
not surrender. They know that
the Government will not treat
them as honorable foes with
whom a compromise peace can
be negotiated. They are criminal
outlaws. Whilst they are in the
jungle a price is on their heads,
and when they com© out of it a
noose will be round their necks.
“So they will resist as long as
they can, and will force their
less enthusiastic followers to
continue their defiance also. We
are already receiving news of
executions in the jungle. The
fanatical captains of guerrilla
units occasionally have to assert
their authority and put courage
into doubting hearts by swift
trials and death sentences,
“We may hope that during
the period which remains before
they are finally overthrown our
offensive action will steadily re-
duce their power to burn and
rob, kidnap and murder. But
we must expect them in their
desperation to be ruthless.
. “Nor must we halt our offen-
sive action against these evil men
until they have been extermin-
ated. We must restore the situa-
tion which prevailed in Malaya
before the war, when the only
armed forces in the land were
those owing allegiance to the
Government, and when peaceful
citizens could live and work
without fear of intimidation or
assassination by gangsters’ guns.
“In doing that we shall achieve
more than a restoration of
security in Malaya. We shall
strike a deadly blow at Com-
munist terrorism throughout
Asia.”

Malayan Communist party is not

incidence that the Communists
in China and Indo-China are
on the warpath and that their
allies in Malaya and Burma and
Indonesia are simultaneously
making violent attempts to over-
throw the Governments.
“These are all parts of a con-
certed plan to extend Com-
munist Imperialism over all
mankind. If anyone doubts that
let him listen to what the local
Communists themselves say.
One document which has re-
cently come into our hands is a
manifesto issued by a rabble of
murderers calling themselves the
Malayan Peoples Liberation
Army of North Johore. After
expressions of admiration for
the Soviet Socialist Republic and
various foreign Communist or-
ganisations they declare; The
national liberation struggle of
Malaya is part and parcel of the
world-wide struggle for justice,
democracy and lasting peace.’
“They are showing the people
of Johore what they mean by
justice, democracy *and lasting
peace. Their justice is the sum-
mary justice meted out by
terrorists who shoot anyone
opposing their will, their de-
mocracy establishes equality be-
tween men, women and children
as victims for the assassin’s gun
and their lasting peace is the
lasting peace which meets you
in the grave when they have
murdered you in cold blood.”
Reluctant Lion.
Maybe it’s only another twist
to the grand old American
amusement of tugging the Lion’s
tail: at any rate, Britain con-
tinues to be strongly blamed for
holding back from all-out Euro-
pean Union.
“This country,” reports a Lon-
don correspondent of N; Y.
“Times,” “is making haste slowly
and with the utmost caution to-
wards European federation.”
The correspondent notes the
powerful advocates for union,
the support of virtually every in-
fluential newspaper and also of
the majority of the Labor party.
“The Labor Government itself,”
he adds caustically, “likes the
idea —as an idea,”
This reluctance has not been
seen merely as the British Gov-
ernment waiting on the
Dominions’ support that was
given the other day in the Lon-
don discussions.
As the N. Y. “Times” man
interprets it, the British Govern-
ment view is that there are
special and compelling reasons
for proceeding carefully and
building solidly in European
union. He represents the Gov-
ernment as doubting the feasi-
bility of early federation ; also,
being itself wedded to Socialisa-
tion, the Government is seen as
believing “it would be wrong
and dangerous to tie Britain’s
planned economy to the free-
enterprise system of other coun-
tries.”
Despite their reservations, the
same British authorities are
touchy on the issue, resenting
being accused of “dragging their
feet,” and pointing to the lead
given in this very matter by Mr.
Bevin. The resentment is in-,
terpreted by some American
quarters as merely evidence of
a bad conscience; they contrast
Mr, Attlee’s inaction with Mr.
Bevin’s high-sounding words.
“Saturday Evening Post”
states in a very blunt editorial:
“The Socialists [i.e., the Attlee
Government] sabotaged the Wes-
tern European Union.” The
“Post” further stated: “Messrs.
Attlee and Bevin appear to be
playing the traditional balance-
of-power game, but have failed
to get beyond the nineteenth-
century conception of what bal-
ance of power involves. The
weakness and defeatism of
France is another factor, of
course, but, if British influence
were more consistent, there
would be more hope than now
exists of turning the emphasis
toward the economic and politi-
cal essentials of Western unity.”
Ready to Revolt.
By the nature of things, ex-
patriates are not the most re-
liable of soothsayers; their
wishes become their beliefs, as
Macaulay noted.
But at all events there is a
striking unanimity among those
escaped from Russia in insist-
ing on a wide difference between
the Russians in general and their
Government, which, they say,
would turn to revolt in a Soviet-
made war and might do so any-
way.
Described as one of their
leaders who is accepted by U.S.
Military Intelligence as “com-
pletely reliable,” Constantine
Boldyreff is quoted on that point
by N. Y. “Daily Mirror”:
“W hen Mrs. Kasenkina
jumped from the window of the
Soviet Consulate in New York,
she was only giving a single,
dramatic expression of the de-
isires of millions of Russian men
and women held in terror by
their Communist dictators. But
a situation will be created in
Russia in a few months that will
make it impossible for Stalin to
attack because of insecurity in
his own ranks.”
Freezing the Earth.
A correspondent in Notting-
hamshire has given details in
London “Times” of a most
extraordinary mining experiment
—nothing less than the freezing
of the earth down to a depth of
412 ft. as a means of overcoming
seepage of water which other-
wise would flow into the work-
ings at the rate of thousands of
gallons an hour.
The experiment is one of
actual refrigeration; the plant
a giant replica of an ordinary
domestic refrigerator, the prin-
ciple being the evaporation of
ammonia. f
This refrigeration scheme be-
came necessary because the
shaft will pass through porous
sandstone forming the under-
ground watershed from which
Nottingham and surrounding
towns draw much of their water-
supply. The first step was to
circle the proposed shaft with a
ring of pipes which pass through
and below the sandstone strata,
and through these.pipes a brine
solution cooled to 37 degrees
below freezing-point is now be-
ing circulated.
By two months hence a collar
of ice will have been formed,
within which barrier normal
excavation will then proceed.
The shaft-sinking is to tap the
virgin coal in the centre of
Nottinghamshire, which, it is
estimated, will yield 1,000,000
tons of coal a year for at least
a century.

O Brave New Something! —On
November 9 they’re holding the
famous Lord Mayor’s Show in Lon-
don with all the ancient colorful
ceremony, and, a correspondent there
reports, one grim difference. It’s
primarily designed this year as a re-
cruiting drive.

U.N.O. Improvement. —Noted edi-
torially by “Saturday Evening Post”:
“One item of news about the United
Nations reassures us. The permanent
staff has appointed a consulting psy-
chiatrst.”
* * * *
British Motors. —If the motor-car
shortage isn’t being rapidly bridged
it’s hardly Britain’s fault. British
car-makers, reports “Wall - street
Journal,” are now exporting “about
18,000 completed autos a month,
against an average of 3677 in 1938.”

The, Maybe Fragrant Weed. —
They’ve long since got past rolling
their own in Britain: according to
“Wall-street Journal’s” London cor-
respondent they’re now growing their
own. “Amateur tobacco-growing is
flourishing in Britain’s backyards,”
the amateurs getting “a big kick out
of growing and curing their own
leaf.” It’s one thing—it must be
about the only thing—the British
Government doesn’t tax. Some
200,000 amateurs are said to be
growing the stuff, and, what’s more
incredible, smoking it. There’s even
a British Pioneer Tobacco Growers’
Association with a membership of
several thousand backyard planters.”

Uncle Sam in Greece.- »—Though the
U.S. has no combat troops in Greece,
nearly 400 U.S. officers and men,
headed by Lieut.-Gen. James A. Van
Fleet, are directing the Greek forces
against the Communist guerrillas right
up to the point of battle. The Ameri-
cans stop short of shooting, but
that’s all. It’s costing money. “U.S.,
News and World Report” states that,
one way and another, Uncle Sam in
the last few years has put $744,000,000
into Greece and will have put in
another $400,000,000 by next July.
The rate is to continue, the dollars
going into development as the Corns
are licked.
* * * *
Where Britain Lags. —As reported
in “Wall-street Journal,” Sir Henry
Tizard, president of the British Asso-
ciation for the Encouragement of
Science, names backwardness in tech-
nology as the weakest point in British
industrial efficiency: “No nation
stands higher than Britain in pure
scientific research. But in applying
science to industry by improved
technology, Britain lags far behind
not only the U.S., but behind small
countries like Sweden and Switzer-
land. There is a pathetic faith among
some Britishers that new scientific
discoveries, such as release of atomic
energy, will prove an ‘open sesame’
to increased production without extra
effort.’’
* * * *
Polio Epidemic. —The current polio
(infantile paralysis) epidemic in the
U.S. is to be recorded, states “U.S.
News and World Report,” as one
of the worst in history; “Number
of cases reported so far is 12,666,
more than most full-year totals. That
is the score at about the half-way
point of the polio season, with the
peak of new cases probably passed.
Prospect is that the year’s official
total will exceed 25,000 cases. It
could exceed 30,000. That compares
with an all-time high of 27,363 in
1916 and 25,191 in 1946.” It is,
however, “killing far fewer persons
than whooping cough, crippling fewer
than rheumatic fever.” There is fear
that “polio is becoming more wide-
spread and more deadly,” but “the
chance that scientists will develop a
preventive or cure still is strong.”
* * * *
Subsidised Socialism. —The N. Y.
“World-Telegram” has consistently
opposed any use of the Marshall
Plan as a means of forcing European
nations to conform to the U.S. eco-
nomic system, but regarding the pro-
posed nationalisation of the British
steel industry it makes a couple of
points which, if that proposal is pro-
ceeded with, will not be overlooked
when Congress discusses further
Plan-allocations: “Would nationali-
sation, or the transition, decrease
efficiency of the industry now pro-
ducing at an annual rate of almost
16,000,000 tons and far above pre-
war? If so, the British Labor
Government would be making an
economic change at the expense of
the Marshall Plan and European re-
covery. Secondly, would nationalisa-
tion create future unfair competition
with American industry in world
markets? If so, the British would
have a right to do that and take any
possible consequences, provided how-
ever they did not do it with Mar-
shall-Plan money. We do not in-
tend to subsidise the destruction of
our basic industry.”

LARRIKINS ALL.
About 30 years ago Louis Stone wrote
Jonah, a story of the Sydney “pushes.”
He called the first part of the book
“Larrikins All,” and in it recorded the
doings of a typical gang of the hoodlums,
led by a hunchback, who terrorised their
own neighborhood, Waterloo, and sought
fun and excitement in adjacent suburbs
and in the top-end of the city proper.
Their least harmful amusement was
lounging at street-corners guying passers-
by ; their mildest crimes smashing shop-
windows and street-lights. The typical
larrikin was a coward on his own, a
savage bully when supported by his Push.
His interests were horseracing and tarts —
“the dogs” and the lottery were then un-
known ; he was loudmouthed and
arrogant, contemptuous of authority and
all who observed it, but scared in the
actual presence of the law. Jonah himself
rose above the mob, and the same
qualities that had made him the leader of
the Cardigan-street Push enabled him to
succeed when he started first a boot-
repairing shop—running his former em-
ployer and benefactor out of business in
doing so —and, later, a shoe-store.
Stone published Jonah in 1911. At that
time the second Fisher Government was
in office —the first Federal Labor Govern-
ment to have a clear majority in both
Houses. There was nothing of the larrikin
about Andrew Fisher and his Cabinet;
they showed a fair sense of responsibility
towards the whole nation, not merely to
those whose votes had put them in power.
During the term of that Government
compulsory military training was intro-
duced and the first vessels of the new
Australian Navy were put in commission.
The Commonwealth Bank was estab-
lished, but there was no attempt to ex-
propriate the trading banks. A couple of
constitutional amendments were sub-
mitted to the people by referendum and
rejected; the Government accepted the
result as the verdict of a democratic
people.
Jonah cared for none of these things.
Neither in his capacity as leader of the
Push nor in his later role of proprietor of
a string of shoe-stores did his creator
endow him with any interest in politics.
Which is a pity ; he would have met some
mighty interesting characters if he had
turned to politics—Labor politics, of
course; no other brand would have been
of much use in the districts Jonah fre-
quented.
He would have been bound to meet
E. J. Ward sooner or later. If sooner,
Ward would have been the gainer.
According to one of his thumbnail bio-
graphers the 1917 railway strike left him
“a barefooted boy”—Eddie was rising 18
at the time, but some boys take longer
than others to grow up—and Jonah, with
his chain of shoe-stores, would hardly
have allowed a mate to get around with-
out hoof-coverings. The gift pair of
boots might have made quite a difference
in the subsequent history of young Ward,
since from his temporary barefootedness
allegedly sprang his implacable hatred of
the “capitalist exploiters.” Had the
Jonah-Ward meeting come later the cir-
cumstances would have been somewhat
different. In 1929 the hunchback would
have found Eddie president of the Surry
Hills A.L.P., editor of the “Tramways
Journal,” the trammies’ delegate to the
N.S.W. Labor Council and secretary of
the West Sydney electoral council —and,
of course, well-shod. He would have
been able to introduce Jonah to Jack
Beasley, M.H.R. for West Sydney and
leader of the Lang group in the Federal
House, soon to wreck a “Labor” Govern-
ment and send the party into the wilder-
ness for 10 years, later to be rewarded
with Cabinet rank, a High Commissioner-
ship and the rank of Excellency. Jonah’s
story of how he turned down the Push
and got on in the world would have
amused Jack ; if Eddie had failed to be
amused by it at the time he would have
seen the humor of it a few years later.
As Eddie became more friendly with
Jonah he would probably have taken him
around to meet some of his fellow-alder-
men on the Sydney City Council—he was
secretary of the Caucus 1931-32. One
alderman he would have met was Jock
Garden. Jonah would probably have felt
a bit uncomfortable with Jock at first,
especially if he looked him up in Who's
Who. Jonah’s connection with religion
began and ended with the Push’s Friday-
night pastime of taking a “rise” out of
the Salvation Army, so he would have
been a little embarrassed to read of his
new acquaintance: “Born Parish of Nigg,
Scotland; educated Bible Colleges,
Glasgow and Melbourne; Minister
Baptist Church, Evangelical Church of
Christ in Australia,” but would have felt
reassured to find that the entries referred
to Jock’s past, and that he had since been,
among other things, secretary of the
0.8.LJ. movement in New South Wales,
secretary of the Australian Communist
party and its first delegate to a Moscow
conference, and was now secretary of the
N. S. Wales Trades and Labor Council.
As the years went by Jock and Jonah
would have had other things in common
beside their friendship with Eddie. As
successful businessmen, Jonah with his
string of shoe-stores and Jock with his
publishing house —astrology a specialty—
they would have found income tax an
absorbing subject; Jock in 1948 was to
admit to a tax slug of £2OOO.
Another Sydney alderman Jonah would
have met would be Daniel Mulcahy,
though it is probable the two would al-
ready be known to each other by name
if not by sight, as Daniel had been on
the Waterloo Council for a number of
years and Mayor for eight. While leader
of the Cardigan-street Push Jonah must
have been responsible for the breaking
of hundreds of Mulcahy’s municipal lights
and for many other misdemeanors not
pleasing to an aldermanic mind. Still, it
is unlikely that Daniel, born in County
Kerry and probably a broth of a bhoy
himself in his younger days, would hold
that against him. There is no record that
Mulcahy ever went in for throwing road-
metal, but in after years he was to prove
himself an ajiept at throwing mud.
Jonah’s chain of shops would have been
useful to him in his relations with his
A.L.P. friends. From his headquarters
in Regent-street he would find it quite
convenient to slip across to the com-
mittee-rooms in West Sydney for a yarn
with Beasley or to the Trades Hall to
discuss business-organisation with Jock.
A branch shop in William-street would
be right in Ward’s territory, and on the
way from there to his Redfem branch
he would pass right past Billy McKell’s
front door—2oo miles from Yarralumla.
Jonah would learn a lot from these gentle-
men, but he could teach them a bit, too.
His training as leader of the Push would
have been of great value in breaking up
opposition meetings. Not, of course, that
Mr. Ward, Mr. Beasley, Mr. Mulcahy,
Mr. Garden or Mr. McKell would lend
themselves to such tactics, but Jonah, with
his larrikin upbringing, would have no
scruples. Such a meeting as that at which
Menzies, having had the temerity to
venture into Ward’s domain, had scrap-
iron thrown at him along with the epithet
Pig-Iron Bob, would have been right up
Jonah’s alley. Both the ironmongery and
the nickname would have appealed to the
Cardigan-street Push.
When the Second World War came
Jonah would have further extended his
knowledge of A.L.P, politicians and their
friends. As a big man in the boot-and-
shoe world he would have been interested
to meet the Commonwealth Controller of
Footwear and Leather Supplies, Sol
Rosevear, whose qualification for the job
—apart from having been one of the
Beasley group that wrecked the Scullin
Government, and from 1941 onwards the
absolutely impartial Speaker who made
a habit of stepping down from the chair
to make partisan speeches—was that he
had once been a timber-worker.
All this, of course, assumes Jonah was
content to stay merely on the fringe of
A.L.P. politics. Had he decided to be-
come a big-time politician on his own
account it would have been another
matter. Suppose, for instance, he had
entered the Federal House in the mid-
-1930’5, He would have felt immediately
at home, for among his team-mates he
would have found his old cronies of the
Sydney City Council, Ward, Mulcahy and
Garden. Eddie and Daniel would be old
hands by then ; Jock a newcomer who
was to last only one term in Canberra,
although his associations with the place
were to last much longer. By entering
Parliament at that time Jonah would also
have met Rosevear, instead of having to
wait long years until Sol became Con-
troller of Boots.
One interesting personality he would
not have met would have been Mr.
Chifley, who had just been callously re-
jected by the electors of Macquarie, and
was spending his enforced leisure pre-
paring his minority report on the bank-
ing system and dreaming of the day when
he would have in his hands hundreds of
millions of the taxpayers’ money to dis-
pose of as he thought fit. Another
absentee would be Bert Evatt, then more-
or-less decorating the High Court Bench,
with his destined role of imparting “a
larrikin streak” to Australia’s foreign
policy still in the lap of the unborn years.
But Jonah would have met them both —
and all the rest of the gang —as the years
went by. Once in Parliament he would
have gone from strength to strength. The
qualities that made, him leader of the
Cardigan-street Push made him a success
in business, and the same qualities would
have raised him above the ruck in
“Labor” politics.
Chifley returned to Canberra in 1940;
Evatt arrived there with a flourish of
trumpets at the same time. Had they
found Jonah there the whole course of
their personal careers would have been
changed. But “Labor’s” course would
not have been much altered. Jonah in
time would have succeeded to the leader-
ship of the party. The leader of the
Cardigan-street Push would have become
the leader of the Canberra Push. A real
larrikin would have become Prime
Minister. And the irony of it is that few
people might have been able to detect the
difference.
“Labor's" Own Depression.
Whatever the Prime Minister’s views
about what he has described 'as the
“economic disaster ahead of Australia”
unless there is more coal production, his
Caucus followers are preparing for the
general elections next year on quite
opposite propaganda. Their chosen
theme is that “Labor” has brought in
the “Golden Age”—that Australia has
never known such prosperity as under the
Chifley Government. G.-G. McKell’s
“gracious speech” from the Socialist
Throne was the election-campaign opener,
and the Budget followed with largesse to
.pensioners and more tax-reductions for
“the workers,” both of fleeting value.
Of course there are obstacles for the
“Golden-Agers” to surmount, and out-
right misrepresentation and false witness
are the handiest means of meeting them,
next to ignoring them altogether. One
Caucusite after another in the Budget
debate took the stereotyped line of elec-
tioneering ; that the soaring prices of all
necessities in this “Golden Age” are the
natural result of the popular refusal
at the late referendum to approve
permanent control of all prices by a
bureaucracy at Canberra. Nothing hit
the Socialists harder than that “No” vote.
“If you had voted ‘Yes,’ ” say the
Chifleyan followers, “there would have
been no rise in prices.” It will soon be
“This Golden Age won’t last unless you
vote for ‘Labor’ again.”
The same “Golden Age” barrackers
even declare, in face of all evidence, that
more coal is being produced than before
the war and that industrial output is
double that of 1939. There is not a line
in current statistics |,nd departmental re-
ports that does not give the lie to all this
or fail to point to the very opposite con-
clusion that, under a revolutionary-
minded “Labor” regime, the plunge into
socialisation has made a mess of this
country’s splendid post-war prospects of
founding a real national prosperity on
development of overseas trade.
It is entirely in the fatuous “Labor”
tradition to pretend that a resolution in
favor of some political quackery will it-
self cure any political ailment. This is,
the Caucus mob believes, good “election
dope.” So they declare that not their
idiotic planning but insufficiency of it
has ruined Australian industrial
economy; and that prize booby of the
Chifley Ministry, Senator Cameron, even
holds that there ought to be more strikes
than there are if the people are to be
really happy and contented. Not the col-
lapse of “Labor’s” post-war “planning,”
not Mr. Chifley’s deliberate inflation of
the finances to provide “more spending
money than ever,” but the people’s “No”
to any further powers for these political
mountebanks is now put out by “Labor”
as the cause of high prices. It would be
ludicrous if it were not so revealing of
the incompetence and false-dealing of
the class-war artists in office who are
rapidly sapping the vitality of the
country.
The answer to the pretence that Federal
control of prices could have kept down
costs is given in the Government’s own
figures. Federal subsidies on everything
the city peoples ate and wore, on their
transport, their fuel and even their leisure
occupations did not repress rising
prices ; they merely disguised them, and
small families paid in taxation for what
big families ate. Even so, the subsidies
were insufficient as incentives to reduce
shortages in potatoes, or coal, or trans-
port services, or milk and butter, or im-
ported textiles. The real producers of
essential commodities knew and said
cynically enough that it was just a ques-
tion of whether the Government, which
had made their businesses unprofitable
commercially, would pay enough to keep
them alive. Prices were not rising under
Federal control, weren’t they? Well,
Federal subsidies on these essential com-
modities totalled:
In 1945-46 £12,983,734
In 1946-47 „ 22,640,908
In 1947-48 35,030,957
And if the Federal Government had kept
them going this year they would have
passed £5O million, still with no prospect
of any end to the inflation until the
“Golden Age” should fall in a heap.
These figures do not include the sub-
sidy to farming industries —dairying,
superphosphates, cornsacks and the like
—which made up an additional six or
seven millions each year (also rising), and
which the Government inherited from
long past and could not discontinue
whatever the referendum vote. In point
of fact,- Federal Budget papers expressly
state that the Government was obliged
to discontinue the chief subsidies not be-
cause of the adverse referendum vote but
“because of growing difficulties in ad-
ministration,” or “excessive and rising
costs,” or (as with potatoes) “because it
depended on acquisition of crops under
war-time contracts,” or because of re-
vised arrangements with milk-producers,
control of whose market prices was like
a hot brick which Canberra hastened
long before the referendum to throw over
to the States. Control of building
materials was another such hot brick.
Their prices were rising so fast that Can-
berra “planners” could not hold them.
As for production comparisons with
1939, United Nations Statistical Office
figures confirm that Australian output of
pig-iron, steel, cement and coal has
hardly advanced at all on 1939 despite
clamant home demand, and that butter
and meat have actually declined, though
the Old World is starving. Yet the in-
crease in numbers of Australians em-
ployed runs into six figures. Contempor-
aneously, U.S.A., Canada and South
Africa comparable producer-countries
unravaged by war —have increased pro-
duction of most of these staples vari-
ously from 50 to 100 per cent. To
famine-stricken Britain Australia ex-
ported much less food in 1947 than in
1938, and even less in values of food
exports, though prices have doubled.
Professor Copland, who does not have
to depend on any “election dope,”
warned the country the other day that
“output of basic materials is much less
than the amount required to maintain
present numbers employed,” that
“Labor’s” boasted “full employment” is
being beaten by “Labor’s” own “go-slow”
practices, and that neither primary nor
secondary industry shows any appreci-
able increase over 1939 figures. Another
witness whom the Socialists can hardly
gainsay is Mr. Breen, the industrial
director of Mr. Dedman’s Department
of Post-war Reconstruction (Mr. Chifley’s
earlier pet). He has just returned from
eight months in Europe and America,
and says:—
Australia is suffering from industrial in-
digestion [his own department’s “planning”],
and cannot absorb all the English and
American capital offering. She has de-
veloped consumer production too quickly,
and for the next three to five years will
have to develop coal, iron, steel and chemi-
cals to support her industrial superstruc-
ture.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister him-
self has contradicted those who say that
coalfield production has not declined by
declaring that “only the expansion of
opencut workings, producing two mil-
lion tons this year, has offset the decline
in underground production and enabled
the more urgent needs of the community
to be met.” The A.C.T.U. president has
“not yet, received from the Prime
Minister” the request Mr. Chifley says
he has 'made that th© unions should give
more careful consideration to the now 13-
months-old Government approval of in-
centive-payments to increase man-hour
production. Under Communist pressure,
the A.C.T.U. won’t tolerate incentive-
payments to workers.
What humbugs these Socialists are!
They are not proof against the slightest
temptation to go off holidaying to the
Capitalist land of plenty and handle real
spending-money; and now Canberra’s
Minister for Supply and Development,
after visiting the King to fix details of
next year’s Royal visit, thinks there-s
nothing so good as New York. Senator
Armstrong returns to this land of
Socialist mess to repeat what he told New
Yorkers;
The future of Australia would be assured
if only it could get the men who built
New York to come to Australia There is
something in the American character of
what we need in this country. We want
men of terrific courage with money to risk.
We want, he implies, leaders of private
enterprise, profit-seekers, men who be-
lieve in work and in freedom to enjoy
the profits they earn from it. A Chifley
Minister says it!
Yet the Chifley Government has been
wasting the period of this Parliament in
preparing a gas-chamber for that prim-
ciple, inciting a class-war against private
enterprise and howling at profit-seeking
as immoral. What humbug what
colossal humbug!


PLAIN ENGLISH
A "New" Wheat Scheme.
All Australian wheatgrowing States have
now approved the Canberra “wheat-stabi-
lisation” scheme.
It’s fairly certain that a drop in world
wheat prices and the probability that the
peak has been passed and lower prices
can be expected from now on persuaded
growers that any form of stabilisation,
with a Government guarantee of a floor
price, is better than none. And though
one section of organised growers offered
the alternative of a somewhat nebulous
“co-operative marketing scheme,” it
made no apparent impression, probably
because it wore a distinct look of having
been hurriedly knocked together by some
of Mr. Pollard’s political opponents.
Anyhow, wheat is henceforth “stabil-
ised,” at least for five years, and the
growers would do well to remember that
Mr. Pollard promised them that he
would consider amendments to the plan
as time went on. In passing, any chur-
lish nark might remark that Mr. Pollard’s
crowd isn’t noted for accepting amend-
ments from anybody ouside its charmed
circle. Wheatgrowers may get different
treatment, wheat seats being important
in Federal elections.
What the growers have now is a Gov-
ernment guarantee of 6s. 3d. a bushel,
f.o.r. ports in bulk, on up to 100 million
bushels of every crop—that is, the export-
able surplus. To raise a fund to provide
this guarantee over the next five years, a
tax of 50 p.c. of the difference between
the guarantee and the export price, with
a limit of 2s. 2d., is to go on every bushel
of exported wheat. This, of course, is
stabilisation by equalisation. The grower,
not the Government, finds the money
for the floor price. This floor price (the
6s. 3d. guarantee) is to be varied “accord-
ing to an index of production costs for
each season,” and right there a large
question-mark intrudes itself. Sundry
Royal Commissions before the war and
Mr. Dedman’s Rural Reconstruction
Commission since the war have never
been quite able to do more than make a
sort of guess at production costs.
The old snag of the farmer’s equity
in his wheat remains, and in this connec-
tion “Labor” will find more than a little
worrying the Country party undertaking
that, if it gets the chance, it will restore
the principle that wheatgrowers should
be the owners of what they produce.
Though refunds are being made of the
export tax gathered under the old stabi-
lisation scheme, the new bill provides
that:
No refunds of tax from the fund shall
be made except after consideration at some
future date. The Commonwealth agrees
that it will not hold an excessive amount
in the fund, and it will consider a refund
of tax to the oldest contributing pool
whenever the financial prospects of the
fund justify it.
Which means that a man may get out of
wheatgrowing after a year or two and
jose his share of whatever disbursements,
if any, take place at the end of the five-
year period. However, since Mr. Pol-
lard so carefully promised to consider
amendments, doubtless this and other
questions will be winnowed-out in due
time. A cynic might observe that the
growers feel reasonably sure that
administration of the scheme will be in
other and less Socialistic hands by the
time the headers go into the 1949 crop.
Check to "Nationalisation. 11
The Canberra Socialists are losing some
of their pristine enthusiasm for “free”
medicine and “free” doctors, and with
good reason. There is formidable evi-
dence from N.Z. and U.K. that national-
isation of medicine does not work out
as the Utopians thought it would, and,
besides, even Mr. Chifley is beginning to
doubt whether he has enough money.
Senator McKenna knows the B.M.A.
is right about the “free”-medicine ramp.
He has now conferred with B.M.A. re-
presentatives about his new “free” medi-
cal service bill—to be introduced this
session, though “it might be two or three
years before the scheme operates.”
Caucus has heard details of the bill,
and members were sworn to secrecy about
it. The A.B.C. news-reader let drop in
one announcement last week, and only
one, a hint that the scheme would be
contributory, and a Sydney Sunday paper
understands patients will pay half-fees.
All Senator McKenna would divulge after
he had enlightened the Caucus meeting
was that the Bill would not aim at nation-
alisation of doctors or dentists. Very
good of him; also very wise.
N.Z. Government’s advisory committee
reported recently on the disillusionment
over there after several years of “free”
medicine that the only effective check on
abuses is to make the mass-rush of
patients” pay directly at least part of
the cost of the so-called benefits re-
ceived. Sir John Morris, president of the
Victorian Medical Board, just returned
from a Red Cross convention in Stock-
holm, reports chaos in Britain as a result
of the “free” doctoring, with daily queues
outside provincial doctors’ surgeries too
long for a single practitioner to deal with.
There is good cause for second
thoughts in Canberra on this dangerous
nonsense. It all threatens to become a
tragic farce.
Simons, of the Y.A.L
Tribute from an old opponent:
Perth (W.A.) got its Jack Simons from his
native Clare (S.A.). With' his sunny nature,
ready speech, ardent patriotism (he idolised
Deakin) and organising ability the tall fellow
made such an impression that visitors curious
about him were as likely as not to be told he
was a future P.M. And had the Labor heads
been partial to him —as they were to Curtin,
from whose weaknesses the other Jack was
free —Simons might have made it.
They were forced into giving him a nomina-
tion for the East Perth Assembly seat, but soon
picked a quarrel with him, alleging that as
member of the Newspaper Proprietors Associa-
tion he must be a party to a strike in a daily-
paper office. So Simons resigned as “Labor”
member for East Perth, contested the by-
election, was defeated and never came back.
It was “Labor’s” loss —and the country’s.
Simons founded the Young Australia League,
and to two generations of boys was “The Boss.”
Victor Courtney, one of the original Y.A.L.
lads, was an original partner also in his journal-
istic enterprises, which from modest beginnings
became considerable after the acquisition of the
“Sunday Times,” on which Courtney went
from cub-reporter to editor. Simons had a
genius for friendship, and hundreds of con-
temporaries in all States felt that something
had gone out of their lives when they heard
his big heart had failed, at 65.
"Labor" and Lisfeners-in.
The Federal Government, personified for
a passing moment in Senator Donald
Cameron, is disturbed in its collective
mind at the trend of commercial radio
entertainment, and, in that spirit of
altruism that is present in all its utter-
BEFORE THE LAW.
“External Territories Minister Ward is said to have urged in Caucus that only Labor barristers
be briefed to plead Government cases in the Courts. Caucus did not agree.”
“Yah, scabs!”
ances though often lamentably absent
from its actions, proposes to do something
for the suffering listeners. Last Wednes-
day the P.M.G. gave the Senate an inkling
of the proposals, though he was careful
to soft-pedal some of the harsher notes.
The Senator found two big short-
comings in Australian radio ; some pro-
grammes are below the standard “listeners
in a progressive democracy are entitled
to expect,” and some stations do not
provide “facilities on an adequate and
equitable basis for the broadcasting of
political and controversial subjects.”
To remedy this state of affairs “Labor”
intends to appoint a Broadcasting Control
Board which will have power over ser-
vices, technical equipment and pro-
grammes—the last item to be conducted
“in the public’s best interests.” Both
national and commercial stations will be
controlled by the board, the A.B.C. be-
coming openly as it has been for some
time in disguise: a Government depart-
ment. Its expenditure will, in future, be
met out of Consolidated Revenue, and the
Treasury and the P.M.G. will be repre-
sented on the Commission.
On the programme side Cameron
pleads that the fact that commercial radio
depends for its revenue on advertising
does not mean that “programmes should
be arranged in the interests of advertisers
rather than of listeners.” But are they
so arranged? The cultural level of
“sponsored” programmes is not particu-
larly high, but it is undeniable that some
of the features with the least claims in
this direction hold the interest of a large
number of listeners. Advertisers are not
fools, and the value they get for the radio
time they buy depends on their ability
to give the people what they want.
Senator Cameron’s board will presumably
give them what it thinks they ought to
want, and that in turn means what
“Labor” thinks they should want.
If the matter ended there it would be
merely another example of a Socialist
Government seeking to play the school-
master ; but the implication is inescajpable
that the Government intends to control,
through the board, the amount of adver-
tising time, and thereby the revenue of
the commercial stations. This aspect of
the bill should be considered in conjunc-
tion with the complaint of a lack of
“facilities on an adequate and equitable
basis for the broadcasting of political and
controversial subjects.”
Political broadcasts are dealt with more
specifically in a provision which bans “all
broadcasts on political matters current in
the preceding five years,” an obvious
thrust, as Mr. R. G. Casey has pointed
out, at the Liberal party’s “John Henry
Austral” broadcasts.
There is a case for raising the standard
of Australian broadcasting programmes,
but the proper course is by example,
through the national network, not by
forcibly-feeding the commercial stations.
And such is the record of Federal
“Labor” that no move it now makes can
be taken at its face-value; all must be
examined for symptoms of socialisation-
fever. In the new radio bill these symp-
toms are alarmingly apparent, and it is
appropriate that the Minister entrusted
with introducing the measure is a former
secretary of the Victorian Socialist party
and was a member of the 1921 Trade-
Union Congress which nailed the Sociali-
sation plank into the A.L.P. platform.
The 40-hour Fraud.
When last year the Chifley Government,
and the “Labor” Governments in four
States —two of them since thrown out of
office and a third only by bad manage-
ment missing the same fate —coerced the
Federal Arbitration Court into awarding
a shortened working week of 40 hours.
The Bulletin called the thing a fraud,
and nobody in the ranks of Socialism
jeered at such criticism more than the
successor to Mr. McKell as Premier of
N.S.W., whom even Mr. McKell disliked
for the job.
This is what counsel for the Common-
wealth Government (a party) told the
Arbitration Court during the hearing:
The Commonwealth says to the Court,
through me its spokesman, with considered
words, that after full consideration of all
the material which has been placed before
the Court, the Commonwealth’s view is
that the evidence given warrants the grant-
ing of a 40-hour week.
Mr. McGirr and the other “Labor”
State Premiersf assured the Court, through
counsel, that their Governments would
be quite able to cope with any alleged
increased cost caused by the shorter
week. Mr. McGirr even forced the
Court’s hands by legislating for 40 hours
in N.S.W. while the hearing was proceed-
ing. After a few months of trial with it,
when doubts about the thing were many
and horrible, and even Mr. McGirr’s rail-
way and road-transport services hadn’t
been able to arrange rosters to accommo-
date the innovation, Mr. McGirr said it
was the finest move ever and had resulted
in no loss of working energy.
Leaving aside the later revelations that
N.S.W. under Mr. McGirr can’t even
grow potatoes, and that the Chifley-
McGirr Joint Coal Board—experimenting
in State management of the mines—can’t
get coal, and is losing more through stop-
pages in its second year than its first, the
N.S.W. Auditor-General publishes shatter-
ing comments on the effect of the 40-hour
week. Last year Mr. McGirr’s Cabinet
went through 10 days of agony before
it could decide to raise first-section tram
fares by a penny in order to meet losses
on the undertaking. Now, with “the
financial structure transformed from
strength to weakness,” it has just re-
peated the performance in respect of in-
creases in other-section fares and week-
end fares, “Labor” can’t palm that off
on the public as being a result of the
“No” vote at the referendum.
Auditor-General Swift shows that 40
hours and wage increases have increased
the daily cost of maintaining &ch bed in
the hospitals from 13s. 9d. in 1939 and
21s. 7d. in 1946-47, to 275. lOd. in 1947-48
and (estimated) 30s. 7d. in 1948-49. The
effect on State-borne costs of hospital
services was to more than double them,
at £5,614,150, in two years. “Increases in
the basic wage and the introduction of
the 40-hour week mainly account for the
huge growth in expenditure on the trans-
port services”;
1945-46. 1946-47. 1947-48.
Railways —, £16,564,762 £20,727,632
Trams and
Buses £3,569,065 3,845,750 4,989,164
In Victoria, too, the Railways Com-
missioners report a record bill for work-
ing expenses of nearly £ls£ millions, an
increase of 18 per cent, over the previous
year. The cause can be stated in the
words used by the N.S.W. Auditor-
General : “Over 70 per cent, of the extra
costs in road-transport wages and salaries
was attributable to basic-wage increases
and the 40-hour five-day week.”
Each rise of Is. in the basic wage
costs the railways another £125,000 and
the road - transport services another
£30,000 per annum. The 40-hour week
alone cost the tram-bus undertaking
£500,000 for the year 1947-48, and the
railways, by parallel computation, about
£2,000,000. The railway fund’s war-
earned surpluses (£lO million in June,
1945) are now all spent, and overspent,
reports Mr. Swift; and “the future of
the tram-bus undertaking as a business
concern is dismal.”
This is the effect of the 40-hour fraud
welcomed in advance by Mr. McGirr on
behalf of N.S.W. service-users, saying that
as a burden it would not be noticed at all.
Now he and his crowd can get to work
persuading tram and train travellers that
the extra charges are only imaginary.
The Blight on Teaching.
One of the important points that seems
to be missed in discussions on the short-
age of trained teachers as well as the poor
recruitment of trainee teachers for the
State schools throughout the Common-
wealth is that teaching is a vocation, not
a trade into which any intelligent
apprentice may enter. Which is probably
why the mistaken view is widely pushed
that if much higher pay was offered the
position would right itself. It will take
something more than that.
The shortage, of course, is to a large
extent part of the general national short-
age of labor. It began with the war, when
thousands ©! teachers rushed to enlist, as
they did in 1914-18. It’s worth remem-
bering by those who run away with the
idea that teachers are “a bunch of Com-
munists” that under the volunteer system
enlistments of teachers for overseas ser-
vice were as high as from any other pro-
fession or trade. All the same, in N.S.W,
at least, the Communists have horned into
the teaching profession, and the effect of
this on rational Australian parents and
young people who might have considered
teaching as a career should be studied.
A fair sample of what goes on occurred
at Corowa (N.S.W.) the other week. At a
meeting of the local schoolteachers one
of their number stood up and boldly said
that the Teachers’ Federation was under
Communist control and that Communists
were disloyal and treacherous. Almost
falling over himself with haste, a Federa-
tion organiser rushed down to Corowa,
called the teachers together, said he’d been
sent to “investigate the deviationist
tendencies” (typical jargon) of the locals,
and accused the teacher of being “an
enemy of the public-school system.”
When a second teacher supported the first,
he, too, was subjected to a lot of abuse.
The effect of this sort of x thing—the
story was published in Riverina papers—
on potential teaching material may
well be imagined. Whatever their faults,
Australians are a loyal crowd and they
believe in a fair go. A lot of young
people with leanings towards the teach-
ing profession know that it is practically
compulsory for them to join this
Teachers’ Federation, and they can
hardly be blamed for shying away from
it.
The formation of teachers’ unions was
a necessary thing. Until their formation
teachers were underpaid and under-
privileged, Organised, they rapidly im-
proved their-status and incomes. To that
point the unions succeeded. But once
they got into the hands of the Communists

some of them, notoriously the N.S.W.
one, became nothing more than a trade-
union, engaged as heartily as [say] the
Miners’ Federation in “fighting the
bosses” and “attacking imperialism.”
These took up party politics, affiliated
with the Trades Halls, took sides in things
like the Prices Referendum. The N.S.W.
one stands for compulsory unionism—
though anyone with a flair for teaching is,
for the most part, an individualist.
All that the public ever hears from
these organisations are demands for more
money, or less work or free holiday-travel
or something. If they ever discuss edu-
cational advancement or put before State
educational authorities plans for school
and teaching improvement the public
seldom hears of them. Yet those parents
who’ve taken the trouble to meet and
talk with teachers know that most of them
are sensible, decent and loyal people
deeply interested in their calling and in
the pupils under their care.
A healthy sign in N.S.W. is the appear-
ance of a teachers’ anti-Communist group,
now claiming 1000 members. Breaking
the grip of the Communists won t be
easy. Until it is broken teachers as a
body will have to put up with public dis-
trust and suspicion, and the State educa-
tion authorities can expect to find trained
teachers resigning from the service and
would-be recruits being scared off. But
everything won’t necessarily be rosy when
the Communists are outed. There is still
need for raising the teachers’ status, and
for ensuring them an income and condi-
tions commensurate with the national im-
portance of their service. Australians,
however, are suspicious of everything
which Communists touch, and the sooner
the teachers realise that and do something
about it the sooner will other people listen
to their claims.
POLITICAL POINTS
Chifley told the House that “Parlia-
ment would debate the dropping or re-
taining of the word ‘British’ when it
debated the Nationality and Citizenship
bill.” Most Australians will be astounded
that the P.M. should even consider the
subject worthy of debate. This is a
British Dominion, founded and developed
by people of British stock who share a
common heritage of British traditions,
law's, language and literature. Is an
Australian any the less an Australian for
taking a pride in his British descent? The
word was adopted to reconcile and em-
brace the more particularised loyalties of
English, Scots, Welsh, Irish and the
Empire countries which the genius of
the four races colonised. That it should
be scrapped for fear of offending the sus-
ceptibilities of alien races which share
the benefits of the British concept, but
do not like to admit it, is an insult to the
> generations who, seeing no shame in the
word, made that concept a thing to be
valued and cherished.
Weaving around for a head to punch
in order to ease his mind over his latest
increase in tram-fares —the second this
year McGirr’s O’Sullivan spotted
“Granny Herald” and' let fly. Pointing
out that the Fairfax sheet, once a penny
paper, now cost tuppence and had almost
doubled its rates for classified advts., he
said “This is the paper that tells you it is
bad administration that forces up fares.”
True enough ; but when the “Herald” in-
creases its charges it at least collects them.
Last minute U.S. election-forecast
notice to Stalin and Co. “Keep off this
grass. It’s Dewey, but It ain’t green.”
Explaining that some commercial radio
stations found their services restricted by
financial difficulties, Senator Cameron re-
vealed that his Broadcasting Control
Board would have power, with the
approval of the Government, to give
such stations financial and other assist-
ance. One station that shouldn’t need
any help under this section is Mr.
Chifley’s 2HD ; its dividend-rate last year
was 16 per cent.
A comparison of price-controls in the
various States, compiled by the Metal
Trades Employers’ Federation, shows
some interesting variations. Considera-
tion for the dead or the bereaved possibly
explains why funeral-service charges are
still controlled in all States except West-
ralia, but in that case why is N. S. Wales
the only one to control coffins? Queens-
land’s failure to control mallee roots is
understandable —Hanlon’s State has none
to control—but does that argument apply
to “suits, tailored,” also off the control-
list up North? In Victoria there is an
open go for anyone wanting to buy or
sell “hatters’ fur —not on the skin,” still
under control in other mainland States,
while Victoria and N. S. Wales retain
control over goatskins, elsewhere un-
trammelled.
Defending his proposals for increased
taxation of private companies, Chifley
claimed that under the present system
men had set aside money for tax-free
reserves. “One of these individuals” had
admitted the truth of this, but had told
him that “the Treasury would get it all
back in probate duty when he died.” To
which the P.M. had retorted that “the
suggestion did not suit him at all, be-
cause he might die first,” At 63, on an
actuarial basis, Chifley the citizen has an
expectation of life of 13 years; Chifley
the Treasurer can count on as many
months.
It has become a common gibe against
our Socialist masters that they couldn’t
run a pie-cart and show a profit. N. S.
Wales Transport Minister O’Sullivan has
given point to the quip by calling for
tenders for the lease of the refreshment-
rooms at Sydney’s Wynyard station.
While every hash-house in Sydney has
been coining money the Government-run
eating-place down the Wynyard ramp
has been losing it faster than a punter
following an “infallible” system. De-
clared loss on Railway Refreshment
Services for the year ended June 30 last
was £19,987, but the Auditor-General’s
report comments that “the real deficiency
on wprking for the year was £97,987.
Revenue was augmented by a transfer of
£78,000 from the Special Reserye.”
For the period of the current year up
to October 23, losses of coal through
strikes exceeded those for the cor-
responding period of 1947 —being
1,577,551 tons against 1,559,011 tons,
a weekly average loss for this year of
38,477 tons. And “Labor” Governments
in Canberra and Sydney which have
taken control over the mines through the
Joint Coal Board pretend that State con-
trol means salvation of industry!
The C.S.I.R. is reported to have dis-
covered “a new type of star which emits
radio waves, but no light.” Can it be
that the researchers have unwittingly
tuned-in to one of Chif’s “Reports to the
Nation”?
Britain’s greedy socialisers, heedless of
the indigestion caused by their meal of
railways and collieries, are out to swallow
the steel-industry. Ivor Thomas, a Labor
M.P., who has resigned in protest, told
them:
Socialist planning is making Britain a
land fit for zeroes The itching fingers
of planners cannot let things a10ne....
After the last three years I have doubts of
both the competence and intentions of our
Socialist Ministers.
The ranks of Australian “Labor” prob-
ably include men who echo Ivor Thomas
in their secret hearts, but none with the
courage to say so.
Up-to-date definition of a lie: An in-
discreet statement by a “Labor” politician
reported verbatim in the press.
Turner, M.L.A. for Kelvin Grove, in
the Queensland Assembly, who blushed
pinkly at what he called a “dirty, filthy
story” told by Fadden at Gatton Col-
lege, was put on the spot a day or so
later. A church elder and opposed to
gambling, he was accused of having wop
a Parliamentary sweep on last year s
Melbourne Cup. It appears he won the
prize all right, but wasn’t aware he was
in the sweep until it was all over. His
colleague, Davis, who had put him in—
in more ways than one —told the House
that when Turner heard the news he asked
him, Davis, to accept the money. When
he refused Turner gave the money to
charity “and he gave my two-bob with
it.” Turner, a little rattled, said “I have
never opposed gambling controlled by
the Government. I hold that a thing
that is publicly controlled is legal.”
Principle is an important thing, but even
a church elder, if a “Labor” member,
can hardly admit opposition to the Golden
Casket or other gambles that have
“Labor’s” blessing.
Another effect of the 40-hour-week
fraud—Australian clothing manufac-
turers are now having shirts (among
other things) made in England instead of
trying to get the job done in local fac-
tories. It should cost more —but does it?
Chifley says he is “more than disap-
pointed” at the latest inter-union quarrel
at Kemeira which threatens a general coal
strike. There won’t be coal for Christ-
mas, and it looks as though “Labor’s”
Communist Left-wing is going to do its
best to- produce shortages of coal, power
and transport for the King’s visit, too.
Chifley will be concocting some hotter
description of his Communist “philoso-
phers” when that prospect shows up more
clearly.
In a Sydney case where one horsey
gent, is claiming from another horsey
gent, money allegedly due for training
expenses, the name of a well-known
patron of the Turf, Senator Ashley, was
brought up. The second h.g. denied lia-
bility on the grounds that he, the first
h.g. and bookmaker William Patrick
Mulligan had an agreement whereby Mul-
ligan was to pay all expenses of training
the horse Piccolo, on condition that Mul-
ligan had control of the noddy’s racing
programme. The first h.g. denied that
Mulligan had any interest in Piccolo.
Mulligan denied it, too, also denying that
he owned any horse. Cassidy, K.C.,
asked:
“What about Flying Duke? Are not
you and Senator Ashley partners in owning
Flying Duke?”
Mulligan: “No, that’s absurd.”
“Senator Ashley is a great friend of
yours?”
“Yes, he is, definitely.”
Mulligan said he had often taken Senator
Ashley to Chaffe’s stables [Chaffe is the
first h.g.l, because the Senator was very
interested in horses. He had never taken
part in discussions between Ashley and
Chaffe.
Sydney had two hot days last week, and
bang!—on came water restrictions despite
the fact that the Water Board had only
recently been congratulating itself on the
healthy state of its reservoirs. Its chief
hastened to explain that there was no
shortage; restrictions had been imposed
“because of the inadequacy of the distri-
bution system.” There’s a hint there for
the Coal Board. Any day now we may
expect it to explain that there is plenty
of coal in the mines, and that it is merely
the inadequacy of the distribution system
that prevents it reaching consumers.
After coming within close range of an
agreement on baking hours, the parties
in the Melbourne bread strike broke off
negotiations. The employers are standing
by the 4 a.m. starting-time award of the
wages board, originally with the carters’
union supporting them; the two unions
—operatives and carters —failed to agree
on a matter of half an hour (5 a.m. or
5.30 a.m.). The Victorian Minister for
Labor and the employers thereupon put
into operation an emergency scheme to
bake bread—not the full normal sup-
ply, but most of it—and deliver
to resellers, hospitals and schools. Every-
body except the operatives’ union had
had enough of the strike.
Queensland at present sends 10 mem-
bers to the House of Reps.—their alle-
giance equally divided between “Labor’
and anti-“ Labor.” The next Parliament
will include 18 Bananalanders, and both
sides seem to be exuding optimism over
the latest redistribution plan. “Labor”
prophets say the party can win 11 seats;
a Q.P.P. seer claims that on the 1946
figures the Lib.-C.P. group has already
won 11 and a two per cent, swing would
give it two more.
The A.M.P. Society is sponsoring a
scheme to develop South Australia’s
“Ninety-mile Desert,” a tract of poor-
quality land through which the Adelaide-
Melbourne railway runs. Although some
of this land is in the 15-20-inch rainfall
area previous efforts at cultivation have
met with scant success. Soil tests carried
out by the C.S.I.R. in the past few years
revealed mineral deficiencies, and experi-
mental plots of lucerne and subterranean
clover grown with the addition of zinc-
and copper-sulphate with superphosphate
have given remarkable results. The
A.M.P. plans to work in conjunction
with the South Australian Government
to develop the area in single-unit farms
for ex-servicemen and others, and it is
hoped the misnomer “Desert” will vanish
from the Ninety-mile Plain.
The Minister for U.N.0., Dr. Evatt,
naturally holds that the body of which
he is temporarily one of the presiding
ornaments is unfairly criticised for its im-
potence, But not Evatt himself can pretend
that U.N.O. is able to stop even a dog-
fight ; and as the “cornerstone” of our
national security in the Canberra Socialist
policy—it saves such a lot of trouble over
military training—U.N.O. is more than
a failure, it is a positive danger. Next
time Evatt visits Australia he might ex-
plain how U.N.O. expects ever to bring
about Russian collaboration for peace.
Winding-up his election campaign
Dewey said of American foreign policy,
“We will not achieve peace by conduct-
ing desperately important matters on a
‘happy thought’ basis or by jovially re-
marking that we like ‘good old Joe’
We will not isolate ourselves. More than
that, we will not permit ourselves to be
isolated and then engulfed.” The Re-
publican leader had already given ample
assurances that he had every intention
of continuing the Marshall Plan of help-
ing Europe to help herself. Any other
policy would merely be an open invita-
tion to “Good old Joe” to help himself.
The Coal Board is claiming 10s.
damages from each of 1200 miners con-
cerned in a strike on September 30 —
not the Chifley-McGirr show, of course,
but its United Kingdom opposite number.
Our Coal Board leaves disciplinary action
to the Miners’ Federation, which leaves
it to Providence.
According to report Ward tried to get
Caucus to agree that the Federal Govern-
ment should brief none but “Labor
barristers to defend its
that many barristers asked “Labor”
M.Ps. who were witnesses leading poli-
tical questions “to embarrass them.”
Caucus, says the story, rejected the sug-
gestion, apparently taking the view that
the winning of cases was more important
than the possible embarrassment of a
member. It is difficult to believe the
report. Eddie, in the witness-box a few
months ago, showed little sign of embar-
rassment. His ready repartee —-“You re a
liar,” “It’s a lie,” “You’re a dirty liar”—
surely showed him the complete master
of himself. Possibly the facts are mis-
reported, and what he really suggested
was that opponents of the Government
should be compelled to employ “Labor
barristers.

"DON'T IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Jasby”: The banning in Sydney of
the play “Rusty Bugles” on the grounds
that some of the words used in it are
“blasphemous and offensive” brings the
thought that there are fashions in swear-
ing as in everything else and that a word
that is offensive in one generation may
become harmless and almost “genteel” in
the next. A case in point is “bloody,”
which shocked playgoers when Shaw first
put it on Eliza Doolittle’s lips, but which
is now scarcely more than a mild exple-
tive. The list of swear-words is a very
short one, and where men are herded
together as in Army camps the really
“bad” words soon tend, through, overuse,
to lose their effectiveness and, to a large
extent, their offensiveness. A lot, too,
depends on the tone in which a word
is uttered. “When you say that, smile,”
said Owen Wister’s Virginian to Tram-
pas, summing-up in a sentence the whole
philosophy of swearing. I recall an Army
acquaintance —a non-drinker, non-smoker
and non-swearer. At least, he would
have been horrified at the suggestion
that he ever used bad language ; yet when
" Don't he impatient , darling—when the gentleman gets up Well all
sit down.”
things went wrong he would come out
with such expletives as “blinking,”
“jolly” and “blessed,” expressed with
such vehemence that they actually
sounded more obscene than the real cuss-
words that were the common currency of
his tent-males.

chins School we were proud of almost
century-old desks and seats carved with
names of predecessors —and our own. We
would run our fingers over famous names
and boast proudly: “He was the
cricketer.” “He’s the Judge.” “He won
the V.C.” After one holiday we returned
to find that a whole field of school history
and tradition had been ploughed under.
The treasured carvings had been planed
off and the old desks and seats sat in
rows, smoothly polished, characterless.
Something was torn out of us by that
vandalism. At the same time the old
front stone steps had been painted glaring
white. The stone would show again in
time, the names never.

“Gerald Ton”: Although the Abro-
holos Group off the W.A. coast may be
only specks on the map (B. 29/9/’4B), the
underwater shoals and reefs of which the
islands are the landmarks occupy quite
a large extent of ocean. Dampier, nosing
his way in Roebuck up the coast of New
Holland, shied off nervously when in
Lat. 29S the lead-line told of a scant
six fathoms, although there was no land
in sight. But the experienced seafarer knew
where he was —not far distant from the
dreaded Houtman’s Abroholos. It was
keeping well west of these shallows that
ultimately brought him along a line of
deeper water to Shark’s Bay. Nowadays
the Houtman’s is dropped from the name,
but the early Dutch were emphatic in
giving the full title. For on the long
voyage from Texel they were obliged to
negotiate an earlier Abroholos —off the
coast of Brazil. This also explains why
Dutchmen came to give a Portuguese
name to one of their own discoveries.
In Iberian the term is “abri vossos olhos”
—literally, “keep your eyes open.” Run-
ning down the Atlantic ships bound for
Rio Janeiro or the Cape found just off the
bulge of Brazil a vast area of shoal water
and islands that spelt disaster unless the
lookouts kept their eyes skinned —hence
the warning that became a name. So,
when in 1619, Frederik de Houtman, in
command of a fleet of 11 ships, nearly
found disaster on some similar shoals off
the coast of New Holland the name
Houtman’s Abroholos followed natur-
ally—Abroholos being the Dutchman’s
contraction of the more voluble Portu-
guese term.

“Zake”; The advertisement, with the
list of amenities and an assurance that
there would be no Saturday work, re-
flected the current difficulty of getting
shorthand-typists, and the flapper who an-
swered it had apparently been well
apprised of her new importance in the
economic scheme of things. None of the
nervousness that once characterised the
girl seeking her first job. With complete
self-assurance she swaggered in to the
sanctum languidly chewing gum. She’d
want time off every Thursday to get a
wet-set —that was the night of her club
dance. She’d want time off for shopping
each week, and on Fridays she’d probably
be in a bit late after the dance. All the
signs pointed to the g.-m’s. rising gorge,
“You’d have no need to worry about
having to go home in peak-hour traffic,
Miss Fetherbrane ’’ he rumbfed in heavy
sarcasm. I could get my chauffeur to
drive you home every afternoon.” Miss
Fetherbrane’s eyes opened wide and she
worked the gum across to one cheek.
“Good for you, pop,” she said. “But
I won’t trouble you—l’d go home on the
boy-friend’s motor-bike. But I could do
with the petrol-tickets you’d be saving—
Arthur’s always short of them.”

“Gravelsnatcher”: Strictly speaking,
“Salt Junk Joe,” when be says “the
term Roaring Forties does not refer
to a wind but to a geographical
zone” (B. 6/10//48), is correct. That
“ You'd better hold him, Albert; that's the second time hes dropped him!"
is the original meaning of the term,
and it is “still retained by pedants and
the unco-leamed. But our language,
though fathered by pedants, is moulded
by the people, and the Roaring Forties
are popularly accepted as the winds
themselves rather than as the region they
frequent.

“Pookie”: Benzedrine (B, 27/10/’48)?
Dr. Paddy Moran, in one of his books,
relates his experience of it in a remote
English village. Moran had gone there
as locum and, considering the size of the
practice, was astonished to find large
stocks of benzedrine. He stayed on the
job somewhat longer than was anticipated
and used the drug for “appropriate ail-
ments.” When the regular quack re-
turned he checked the drugs and indig-
nantly demanded what had become of
the benzedrine. Moran told him, and
was bitterly informed that the benzedrine
was not intended for human patients at
all, but for greyhounds.
* * * *
“Harpee”: Nothing will prevent me
from attending the next night meeting of
those noble animals —the greyhounds.
My curiosity is aroused. A radio com-
mentator, describing the performance of
a “hound” he had recommended to his
listeners, finished up by saying, after the
race, that “she stopped like a shot out of
a gun and folded up.” Any canine cap-
able of performing this feat must be
worth going a long way to see.

“Uramao”': It’s going the rounds in
Maoriland. A much-harassed citizen,
feeling that taxation slugs would eventu-
ally finish him off, made his will. He
directed that his body be cremated. His
wife asked him how he would like his
ashes disposed of. He replied that after
cremation the ashes be gathered together,
placed in an envelope and addressed to
Finance Minister Nash, with a note:
“Now you’ve got the blanky lot!”

“8.M.”: Maoriland Parliamentarians
during the past few years have added
some gems to the stock of spoonerisms.
There was the one made when an Auck-
land member, carried away with his de-
nunciations of the opposing party, warned
his hearers against “leopardising their
jiberty.” The latest occurred the other
day in the House when one Minister re-
ferred to his esteemed leader, Feter
Praser.”
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp”: The drunk at the
next table wept into his soup as he
whispered—in a voice that rose at times
to dramatic declamation —of his home
troubles. “Treated like a dog that s
me. Like a dirty dog, that’s all I am.
In me own home. But I’m going to
leave. Got a place to go to and then
they’ll see.” He went on to talk about
the suspected infidelity of his Wife and
the transgressions of his I m
washing me hands of them that s what
I’m doing. Going away.” He laid his
hand on the sleeve of his pal. But
don’t say a word to a soul about what
I’ve told you,” he begged. The people at
four neighboring tables, the girl at the
cash desk, three waitresses and sundry
passers had heard all about it, but if his
wife heard of his outpourings and taxed
him with it he would probably charge
his pal of the lunch-table with being a
traitor who could not be trusted with a
secret. It’s a risky business being the
heart-confidant of a drunk.

“Spinet”: Disabled artists (B.
6/10/’48)? The Brazilian mulatto
Antonio Francesco Lisboa was a disabled
artist if ever there was one. Nicknamed
“The Cripple ” he was born in 1730 in
the mining village of Ouro Preto, so
twisted and ugly that he was repulsive to
everyone. He had no education and no
teacher, and at 46 he lost his toes and
fingertips, but he continued to paint and
to carve. Two negro slaves carried him
to his work and bound the brush or chisel
to his crippled hands. Brazil’s first great
artist, he worked until his death at 84.
Ouro Preto, now deserted, has been pre-
served by the Brazilian Government as a
national monument.

“Bybren”: Most remarkable exhibit in
Adelaide’s Flower Day Festival was an
aviary modelled on the lines of a
Georgian home. About 4ft. high and
surrounded by a miniature garden with
sundial and bird-bath, it stood at the
entrance to Government House. As 1
struggled through the crowd to glimpse
the model a woman beside me held her
youngster up for a better view. “Isn’t
it lovely?” she asked her hopeful. “It’s
worth £2OO, and it took the man two
years to make it.” Junior broke up the
traffic-jam with “Gripes. No wonder
they’re taking so long to finish our
house.”

“J.H.M.A.” on Cunningham’s tomb:
Close by the old wall that divides the upper
and lower Botanic Gardens in Sydney, enclosed
in a sandstone obelisk, rests Allan Cunning-
ham —botanist, explorer and Australian pioneer
—and all about him are beautiful specimens ot
the flora to the knowledge of which he devoted
his life. Cunningham was born at Wimbledon
on July 13, 1791, and trained for a legal career,
which he abandoned as soon as he could for the
practical study of botany, eventually becoming
assistant-director of Kew Gardens, whence, as
one of “Sir Joseph Banks’s young men,” he
was sent to collect plants in Brazil, where he
spent two interesting years. In the middle
of 1816 he sailed for Sydney, to study and col-
lect botanical specimens in New South Wales.
Soon after his arrival he went exploring with
Surveyor-General John Oxley, and when he re-
turned at the end of a year was attached to
Lieutenant Phillip Parker King’s survey of the
Australian coasts, which kept him employed
until April, 1822. In the following August he
began botanical research in the Illawarra dis-
trict, continuing subsequently in the Blue
Mountains and the country, between Bathurst
and Mudgee. Next year he began the series
of explorations which opened up the Liverpool
Plains and the Darling Downs, and in 1828
discovered a route to the last-named district
from Moreton Bay. He spent four months
botanising in Maoriland, and visited Norfolk
Island in 1830. Returning to England at the
begining of 1831, he spent the next four years
at Kew, arranging and naming the specimens
collected in Australia. At the end of 1831 he
was offered the position at Sydney of Colonial
Botanist, but didn’t take it, suggesting that it
might be given to his brother Richard. This was
done, but when the latter was lost on Sir
Thomas Mitchell’s expedition of 1835 the offer
was again made him and this time accepted.
He arrived in Sydney again in 1837, but found
the job uncongenial, owing to the official view
that he was a kind of exalted vegetable-gardener
for the higher civil servants and their families.
Failing to get the position he wanted as
Government botanist, he left Sydney for Maon-
land, where he spent six months in botanical
research. He returned with his health broken,
and died in a cottage in the Botanic Gardens
on June 27, 1839. He was buried in the old
Sandhills cemetery, and when the bodies de-
posited there were exhumed in 1901 to make
room for the Central Railway station his re-
mains were placed in the obelisk, where they
are now. Apart • from its purely botanical
aspect, there can be little doubt that Cunning-
ham’s best work for Australia lay in what he
did towards opening up the vast and ncri
territories in the north between the head of the
Hunter River and Moreton Bay.
THE LATEST “YOUR
EXCELLENCIES.”
“Mr. Beasley and the other Australian High
Commissioners abroad have been formally Invested
with the prefix of ‘Excellency,’ a distinction hitherto
reserved for Ambassadors and Dominion Governors.
Most sturdy Laborites profess intense
Disdain for any titled eminence.
Such things as Birthday honors and the like
Give them, to use a homely term, the spike;
A sound aversion, it must be allowed,
They well may feel it hurts them with the crowd
To grab at any rank that’s held to be
A sign of higher social quality
Than those on whom, their party creed denotes,
They toil for uplift—and depend for votes.
Yet ever and anon, you can’t gainsay,
Some mark of royal favor comes their way.
Some drops are from the fount of honor
sprayed
They couldn’t, even if they would, evade. *
To elevate the job these trusty wights
Perform for us to more imposing heights,
Inexorable etiquette decrees . M
They now must be addressed as Excellencies,
A form of speech they could have scarce, it
seems,
Anticipated in their wildest dreams.
“Your Excellency! ” What a word it is
To indicate with sounding emphasis
The chap employing it is well aware
Of someone well above him on the stair,
Some figure it behoves him to address
With loyal allegiance and respectfulness.
You’d think in Labor ranks there’d be a bit
Of difficulty getting used to it.
The prefix that a grateful land accords
Its Beasleys and its Makins and its Fordes.
Secure from party strife and faction’s stir,
Who wouldn’t be a High Commissioner,
Engaged among our kinsfolk to diffuse
'Australia’s —which are mostly Evatt’s —views?
Our Treasury their service estimates
At patently Ambassadorial rates,
And what more fitting way to represent
The excellences of their management
Than to announce (however much it vexes
Old Labor notions) all are now “Your Exes.”?

“Bosun’s Mate”; The whole company
of Davy Jones’s locker would approve
that bell-rope of Captain Maitland’s (B.
27/10/’4B). Nearly 3ft. long and about
liin- in diameter, it consists of thousands
of knots tied around an inner core of
steel. There are turk’s heads, rose-and-
star knots, diamond knots, wall-and-
crown knots and dozens of others new
to this seaman and braided in red, yellow,
blue and white bands round clear spaces
of tightly-plaited coach-whipping. The
top of the rope is knotted into a crown,
and the bottom, where the brasso-stained
hand of Vanguard’s sideboy tolling the
hours will grasp it, is stranded into a
pure-white smother, like lace on a gal-
lant’s cuff. In all. Captain Maitland
used a mile or so of macrame twine, and
the job took him seven weeks of spare-
time knotting. He has produced two
other masterpieces. The first rests with
cruiser Sydney under the Indian Ocean,
and the second, presented .to Mount-
batten, graces the bell of a naval officers’
training school in England.

“B. A. Ker”: For years novelists and
journalists have been leading me up the
garden path, and if I hadn’t wandered
off the course when looking up the spell-
ing of a word I would still be a victim of
misrepresentation. In my early youth I
learned that villains .automatically turn
livid when enraged. For a time I was un-
decided whether that would be very white
or very red; but as I could not imagine
a greater villain than our schoolmaster,
and as his ravings always made his face
a flaring red, I accepted livid as meaning
red. Now I find livid defined: “Black
and blue; discolored, as flesh, by con-
tusion.” I was m6re often livid than my
master. All my reading life, too, tough
men have used, “lurid” language. Well,
anyone who has heard the vocal efforts
of tough men would naturally assume
lurid to mean colorful, bright-red. Wrong
again. “Lurid: ghastly pale; dismal;
wan.” Anybody ever hear ghastly pale,
dismal, wan swearing?
* * * *
“Gnomes”; “Penola” (B. 20/10/’4B)
asks where the word “gremlin” came
from. I dunno ; but it most certainly is
not, as many think, a word coined during
the war. The Scottish novels of Dr.
George Macdonald, written 60 or 70
years ago, mentioned these “little men”—
they were always good gremlins, too ;
used to help in the dairy, and so on.
After the maid had had a late night out
(if she was a good girl!) she would find
all her work done by the gremlins. The
word is not in any English dictionary
that 1 can find —nor any encyclopaedia.
* * * *
“Pontius Penwiper”; “V. Cluse” (B.
20/10/’4B) can disillusion himself of the
idea that the old congratulatory “Good
iron!” “arrived with our British fore-
bears.” In the last decade of last century
quoits swept the country like an epidemic.
The rope quoits were sometimes em-
ployed, of course, but the real game was
with iron ones, and any shot that caught
the peg was “good iron.” The term quite
naturally became one of-general approval
for anything. Three Sydney pubs had
adjacent strips used as pitches, and players
took possession of playing-spots in all the
parks, whilst during the lunch-hour the
ring of the quoits could be heard in lane-
ways right in the city’s heart. There have
been periodical revivals, but never on the
same scale as the original craze.

“Lower Tops’l”: Those fishing-rods
being manufactured from the timbers of
the Marie Laure in Melbourne are not the
first articles to be fashioned out of this
old vessel. When the bluff-bowed old
hooker was hulked in the Yarra 55 years
ago, her bowsprit and several other spars
were found'to be rosewood and were
sold for furniture-making. Until recently
this old lighter was the oldest vessel afloat
in the Southern Hemisphere, antedating
even the clipper era of the ’fifties. Built
of teak in the Seychelles in 1840, the
Marie Laure arrived in Hobart Town.

later. Fitted out as a whaling barque for
Tassie owners, for the next 44 years she
sailed the Pacific, lowering her boats as
far afield as the Behring Sea and the
southern ice-packs. For many years her
skipper was a Cape Verde Island black,
a champion sailor and whaleman, though
unable to read or write.

“Pongo”; Prefabricated houses (B.
22/ 9/’48)? I nominate an iron structure
imported by the trustees of St. Stephen’s
Presbyterian Church, Sydney, as Aus-
tralia’s first prefabricated house of wor-
ship. Iron-framed, and walled inside and
out with exceptionally heavy-gauge cor-
rugated-iron, it was made in England and
arrived here in the late ’thirties or early
’forties. Later it housed the Sydney
Municipal Library, and was located on
the northern side of Parliament House.
Dismantled at the turn of the century, it
was re-erected as a recreation hall at
Liverpool Asylum, where, still sound after
over a century, it stands today. It is one
of the best-constructed buildings in Aus-
tralia, I should know; I.assisted in its
dismantling and re-erection,

“Helldud”: The chain-letter racket had
a forerunner in Sydney 50 years ago,
when a good pair of boots could be
bought for half-a-sovereign. Some
shrewdies thought up a boot-ticket club.
For a bob they sold a book of 20 tickets
priced at 6d. each. By selling the tickets
and returning the money, the book-holder
earned a fine pair of boots. In turn, thpse
who bought the sixpenny tickets called at
the office, presented their ticket and a
shilling and were given a book of 20. A
pair of boots for Is. 6d, and the expendi-
ture of a little energy seemed a sound
proposition, and in no time the book-
sellers had collected thousands of bobs
from an ever-increasing stream of “get-
boots-easy” customers. Eventually every-
one in Sydney had tickets to sell, but
there were no buyers left. Police got busy,
but too late. The shrewdies with their
books, boots and bobs had vanished. For
months, afterwards “Buy a boot-ticket?”
were “fightin’ words.”

“Cheops”: A Granville (N.S.W.)
parson has discovered something he con-
siders far more important for young
married couples than sex education; he
advocates psychological education. He
says that one of the chief causes of matri-
monial explosions is that wives tell all
their troubles to their husbands as soon
as they come home from work. He
reckons that while young couples will
“swarm to sex lectures like bees to a
honey-pot” you can’t get them to listen to
lectures on psychological or spiritual
issues. The sex factor is not the chief
wrecker of marriages. People can usually
adjust their physical differences, but it is
harder to adjust differences in tempera-
ment.
* * * *
“Ceg” on two places of happy memory
to soldiers of the First A.f.F.:
Simpson’s, in the Poultry off Cheapside, a
famous chop-house, which every day at 2 p.m.
put on a fish lunch in a large room with two
long tables running the length of it and at one
end a sort of magistrate’s bench. About two
o’clock an elderly person dressed in sober black
would mount the bench and say Grace. Where-
upon the waiters started their job. First a fish
soup and then two or three fish courses. Diners
held on to the one set of ironmongery during
the meal. After the fishy business had been
disposed of, a large round cheese with a cut or
two out of it was held up by a waiter for all to
see and then passed to the “magistrate bloke” on
the bench. Small cards and pencils were handed
to each diner* who tried to guess, within a
fraction of an ounce, the weight of the cheese.
The cards collected, the cheese was placed
on large scales and its weight announced.
If any diner had it correct Simpson’s turned on
champagne for the whole room. That the
weight had been correctly guessed over the years
was evidenced by the large number of framed
certificates on the walls giving the guesser’s
name, the date, etc. The second place was the
Cheshire Cheese Tavern in Wine Office Court,
off Fleet Street. Most Diggers visiting London
managed to find their way there, but how many
knew that by going out to the back near the
kitchen they would find two wooden doors,
whitewashed and fixed with a chain and pad-
lock? The chain and padlock didn’t present
any difficulties to me and my mate, and we
passed through and down some steps into the
cellars. These were full of interesting old wine
vats, and soon “Simon the Cellarer” arrived.
He was delightful—and hospitable. Overhead
the traffic along Fleet Street was rumbling—
and we let it keep on rumbling. A large visitors’
book contained signatures of many British Army
leaders and others. We were permitted to sign;
at that stage we could still write our names
quite legibly.
* * * *
“Bo”: I bear, with what fortitude I
can muster, the inexorable fixed grin of
the half-nude beach brat so beloved of
the flapper-press photographer. The
smiling poster-girl I can generally tolerate,
though what a blessed relief it would be
were some advertising man to discover
the attractive possibilities of a girl’s face
in repose! But why, in heaven’s name,
must the poster artist be so divorced from
the realities as to depict a girl immediately
after having belted a golf-ball, gazing
with smiling rapture at an obviously
distant horizon and apparently waiting,
with magnificent confidence, for the pill
to trickle into the tin? As an observer of
the female physiognomy on the links I
group them into two general classes: the
battle-axes and the miss-and-giggles. The
former group, deadly serious as to their
game, regard the ball as a personal enemy,
and the grim manner with which they
set about dispatching it is usually re-
flected in their faces. The members of
the other group emit a series of colora-
tura “he-hes” every time they swipe at
and completely miss a ball (“I won’t
count that one. Mavis! ”). But a calm,
serene smile from the Lady of the Links
—definitely no.
♦ ♦ * ♦
“Ex-Sgt.”: On Salisbury Plain during
World War I the flies were unpleasantly
numerous, and the Sanitary Sub-Officer
had been endeavoring to have “Horse-
fall incinerators” installed at the latrines.
The Heads were against it, as they con-
tended that the odor of the burning re-
fuse would be objectionable; and that
as the latrines were so distant there was
no risk of contamination of food. About
a week after the S.S.O.’s suggestion was
turned down it was noticed that a new
white-colored fly was very prevalent
around the mess-tables, particularly in the
officers’ mess, which was nearest to the
latrines. The colonel sent for the S.S.O.
and asked him if he could tell them what
kind of fly it was. The S.S.O, (who had
a slight impediment in his speech when
excited) replied “Y-yes, sir, it is the
o-ordinary house-fly.” “But why are
they white?” asked the colonel. “W-well,
sir,” said the 5.5.0., “as you wouldn’t
believe they came from the 1-latrines to .
the camp I got some c-cornflour and
s-sprinkled all of the 1-latrines and most
of the flies with it to prove they c-could,”
* * * *
“W.G.’s Ghost”: I deplore this un-
dignified scramble for souvenirs at the
end of a Test match. It seems to me that
the winning team should have them;
there are just enough to go round—six
stumps, four bails and a ball. The losers?
Well, they can’t all expect a trophy, but
maybe the umpires would donate their
hats and coats for the casting of lots.
* * * *
“O’Johnno”: In my boyhood days
popular gifts for children were cast-iron
money-box banks in a wonderful variety
of mechanical designs. I recall a negro
with scarlet lips who clapped into a
capacious mouth the penny you placed
in his hand. There was a smiling Uncle
Sam, with striped pants; a coin popped
into the outstretched palm found its way
into a carpet-bag which fell open to re-
ceive it, while Uncle’s beard waggled*'in
glee. Then there was Jonah and the
Whale, with the big fish sliding up on
a great wave as his jaws opened to collect
Jonah from a red-coated old prophet
who hurled the laddie inside for a copper.
I have been reminded of those bright
penny-forfeit days on reading that a man
in America, president of a bank, has
collected hundreds of the ingenious gad-
gets. But why not reintroduce the idea
in Australia? One design I’d suggest
would be Whale Chif. gobbling a private-
bank investor every time the figure
worked.

THE SERVICE MAN
THE CONQUERED: THEIR PROBLEMS
From "EK DUM" in Japar
The Japanese are a conquered
race. Thousands of tons of
bombs, fire and otherwise, have
been rained on them. Miles
upon miles of all their main
cities were blown to smithereens
or reduced to ashes. What hap-
pened to Hiroshima was a cir-
cumstance compared to what
happened to Tokyo, Yokohama
and some other great cities of
industrial population. Tokyo’s
main business centre, the Maru-
nouchi, magnificently planned,
has wide open spaces on which
great buildings stood. Some-
times they have been turned into
car-parks and sometimes filled-
in with temporary buildings.
By and large, however, Japan
does not look like a conquered
country. The population, and
especially the rural population,
apparently regarded what hap-
pened in 1941-45 much as it re-
gards earthquakes and plagues.
It holds no more resentment
against its conquerors than it
does against an active volcano.
It takes the advantages which it
derives from the presence of its
captors as it would accept a rain
of manna from heaven.
To a great many Japanese the
presence of occupation forces
means plenty of work, high pay
and easy conditions, and they
wish that the occupation might
continue for ever. To those
who were employed in heavy in-
dustry conquest has brought
dislocation, but this is purely
temporary. Some works, like
the immense shipbuilding-yard
at Kure, which is one of the
strangest and most staggering
sights in the world, are literally
burnt-out ruins. There in that
tremendous chaos of old iron,
mangled steel framework and
derelict machinery, great guns,
battleship boilers, destroyer
prows, anchor chains, copper
filings, turrets and a riot of
sawn-up armor-plate and ships’
anchors the world’s biggest
battleship dock, far bigger than
Sydney’s, is filled to the brim
with broken wreckage, yet is
large enough to contain only a
fraction of what has been
knocked down or broken up.
Wheels Turning Again
But the wheels of part of the
Kure plants are already turning,
and in the larger centres such
as the Himeji-Osaka-Kobe area,
which forms virtually one huge
industrial town, larger probably
than anything of the kind in the
world. There chimneys are
smoking everywhere grand
chimneys which rear themselves
in bunches and clusters —and the
cities are filled with native in-
dustrial products. Huge depart-
ment - stores in Tokyo are
crammed full of luxury foods
at staggering prices. Fifty kinds
of cameras, superb imitations of
the world’s best, compete for
attention with acres of field-
glasses and microscopes, which
sell at what would be the price
of their stands in Australia.
China, damascene, cloisonne,
silks of thousands of colors and
patterns fill the windows and the
counters of all the big em-
poriums, and the streets hum
with motor traffic, for Tokyo,
at any rate, is a city full of the
very latest and most luxurious
in American motor transport, a
very large proportion of it 1949
vintage, driven by 1949-model
Japs working for the Americans.
It is all in keeping with the
magnificently - planned large
cities, the civic centres of which
are amazing to Australian eyes,
the huge buildings full of milling
workers and customers, and the
lovely parks, with which only
those of Paris can compare,
seem no less dear to the Jap
mind than they were even
though the Americans have
taken off the original names and
substituted for them the names
of General Doolittle and other
U.S. war heroes.
The Harvest Month
In the country just now the
harvest is beginning. It is an
arduous business for the farmer,
since fields, outside the Tokyo
Plain and some of the wider val-
leys along the inland sea, climb
the hills on terraces to an amaz-
ing height. On the hillsides
among the dark pines and the
clean, grey granite rocks, the
haunts of bluebells and the
scented pines, Papa San is chop-
ping up loads to make the build-
ing to house his green-skinned
but refreshing mandarins and
oranges. The big red apples and
the pears are ripe, and are laid
out on clean China plates in
every village. The countryside is
gay with banners and loud with
the music of the harvest festival,
and every ricefield is bowed
down with a bumper crop, some
of it a little battered by the
heavy bursts of rain which
Libby and Martha, our two pet
typhoons, are sending off.
The Favorite Industry
Everywhere there is an air of
rich productiveness except in the
war industries, which are dead.
The counter to its effectiveness
lies in the fact that in one field
of manufacture the Jap is
supreme and unapproachable—
the production of more and
more Japs, The first thing which
strikes a visitor only two days
out from Darwin is the com-
parative youth of the general
population and the huge ingredi-
ent of children under the age of
10. They haunt the streets in
mobs, droves and battalions.
The elder legions of them
parade the footpaths in bands in
their naval caps (if boys) and
sailor blouses (if girls) selling
crimson feathers for the Com-
munity Chest Fund. The younger
roll about in the fairway of every
motor highway and country
lane. The striking thing about
them is that they are all as sleek
as racehorses and as disciplined
as regulars. They learn to bow
and to obey before they can
walk, and it is not either our-
selves or the Americans who are
teaching them to any extent.
They are being trained by the
conquered, not the conquerors,
however some people may flatter
themselves to the contrary. And
they are Asiatics and always will
be Asiatics whatever we try to
make of them.
At the rate they are being
bred at the moment, and having
regard to continually improving
hygiene in the towns and shorter
hours of work —they have an in-
dustrial 40-hour week these days
-—they are the real problem of
the future for those who won the
war. It is impossible that exist-
ing Japanese territory can sup-
port them all, and not all the
Evatts or the Wards can make it
provide them with food and
clothing. They are the most
sinister facts about Japan today,
the more sinister because just
across the Japan Sea, a couple
of hours’ flying-distance, is a
Power which is monopolising
the news here at the moment
and which has involved the
world in a situation which some
observers here believe must
blow up within the next six
weeks or so.
The U.S.S.R. & Lebensraum
The newspapers of Tokyo and
Osaka have only one real topic
this week the U.S.S.R.
“8.C.0.N.,” the paper of the
British Occupation Force, gives
almost the whole of the main
three of its four news pages to
the subject. Movements in
general are based upon appre-
hension of what is to come.
General MacArthur has this
week been involved in confer-
ences with Lieutenant-General
Twining, Air Force officer com-
manding in Alaska, and Vice-
Admiral McCrea, Deputy Com-
mander of the Pacific Fleet, and
every measure is said to have
been taken to avoid the chances
of another “Pearl Harbor” in
the Eastern Command.
The most important issue in
the Pacific situation is a longer-
term one. There is only one

New York to
country adjacent to Japan which
could offer the Japanese ground
on which to expand. It is easy
to conceive that Russia must
have among its plans one to in-
tegrate Japan in the Soviet sys-
tem, supplying lebensraum and
adding Japanese potential to the
strength of the Soviet Union.
Given Japan as an industrial
source, the U.S.S.R, could put
the seal on a conquest of Asia.
It is the only country which
really is in a position to offer
the Japanese something tangible
and immediate. And however
unpalatable it might be for the
Japanese to accept, the growth
of population may force them
into doing so if the Western
world cannot provide some
other solution. The time will
soon come when there must be
a long-term solution, and the
only long-term solution which is
conceivable is an expansion of
territory, unless there is drastic
reduction of population.
The implications of that fact
are not to be balked, especially
by Australia.
Where the Two Wars
Meet.
“Gelt” from a white bed in
Sydney:—
Nobody has taken much notice of
it all as a facet of war —the white-
enamelled iron bedsteads, with their
Red Cross covers, were well dressed
by the right, as I looked down the
line from my pillowed position on the
ward verandah.
It was the same old scene, more
or less, that I had gazed upon as far
back as 1917 when, evacuated from
a C.C.S. in Flanders, 1 passed on to
the Canadian base at Etaples, then
on to a Blighty hospital and even-
tually convalescing in Harefield. Later
at George’s Heights much the same
scene met me in Australia. Always
the white-enamelled iron bedsteads,
well dressed by the right.
And now, here was I 30 years later,
once again propped up with pillows,
squinting down the ward at the neatly-
made beds, with their Red Cross
covers, the long-legged bed-tables,
covered with books and craftwork,
and the Diggers sleeping or propped
up with pillows as I was.
There they were: Bluey, Snowy,
Dark and Dad or Pop, just as it used
to be. But there were more “Pops”
now; more of the “Old soldiers who
never die, but only fade away.” And
here was where they faded: out here
at the Repatriation Hospital, at Con-
cord (N.S.W.) —“ 113th A.G.H.” of
the Pacific War —the old soldiers of
the first war, and the young soldiers
of the last war. (Last war?...who
knows?)
The Sameness of It
It is here at Concord that the
soldiers of the two wars meet. An
apt name is Concord, signifying agree-
ment and harmony between the old
and the young heroes, and I sensed
a certain regard shown by the younger
generation for the Dads and Pops.
Perhaps they realised that they, too,
might become the Dads and Pops in
the years to come, paying for their
soldiering 30 yea’rs after the flags had
waved for them.
But there they were lying side by
side: Pop, who had been gassed at
Poziferes: Snowy with malaria from
Milne Bay and Bluey with a duodenal
ulcer contracted “somewhere up
North.” Though 30 years lay in
tween their battles they all spoke the
same language, had the same ideas,
had striven for the same goals and
had fought the same old fights to
rehabilitate themselves.
There was the same old eliminator
of social distinctions the pyjamas
and dressing-gowns the uniform
which levels most outward appear-
ances and individuals become mere
bed-numbers.
So many things the same as 30
years ago: the dominating sister, the
coquetry of the pretty nurses, the
industry of the not-so-glaraorous, the
casualness of the orderlies. The same
flutter of excitement on approaching
visits from matron and doctors, and
the same speculation as to the doctor’s
verdict.
“That’s all right, son, just take
things easy,” from the medico on his
rounds, as he gives a friendly pat
on the shoulder. That means another
month or six weeks of treatment.
There was a difference now in the
patients’ desires and hopes as to the
doctor’s verdicts. The number of
lead-swingers were few. There was
a general desire for favorable reports
and speedy discharge, especially
among the younger patients. There
was a job to be done in the outside
world : crops to be harvested from the
market-garden, a truck or tractor
needing repair, a well-paid job teeing
jeopardised through absence, or the
possibility of an unfavorable medical
report on discharge.
Amenities and Plans
The tired, anxious eyes of the little
wife, or the grey-haired mother trying
so hard to be cheerful on visiting-
days, were the reason for this urge
for health and freedom. The susten-
ance allowance to patients and their
dependants is insufficient to meet the
costs of the present-day standard of
living. Thirty years ago it would
have been more than adequate, but
the luxuries of those days have now
become necessities.
There are other changes, too. In
the easy banter carried on between
the beds the expressions are of the
new vintage: “Pull your head in!”
“Shoot through!” There are more
Mates than Diggers. Gone are such
phrases as “Hop-over!” and “Pin-
out!”
But there are amenities now never
dreamed of in the days of the
“Diggers”: Earphones at the bed-
side, with a choice of broadcasting
stations; daily attention from the
Occupational Therapy and Red Cross
workers and, incidentally, considerable
rivalry between the two organisations
under the surface.
There is the paperman calling twice
a day, with unlimited supplies of
cigarettes of English brands, and on
race days a patient may somehow
find a means of taking an interest
in his favorite. The Red Cross
Rooms, though well known in World
War I, are far more comprehen-
sive in catering for the patients’
wants than 30 years ago: well-stocked
libraries for every literary taste, bil-
liards, table-tennis, a bowling green,
a picture-theatre and cafeteria, reading-
rooms and material for arts and craft-
work. There is some form of enter-
tainment available nearly every night
in the hall or theatre.
A rehabilitation officer regularly
visits each patient prepared to iron-
out his problems —whatever they may
be. Is it a trade or profession he
desires to take up? Then the neces-
sary machinery will be set in motion.
Does he require a house? Even that
rarity may be organised. A loan to
start or extend his business? It can
be done. Employment? . That is the
easiest of problems. Pension matters,
sustenance problems are all subjects
which the quietly-spoken, understand-
ing officer is prepared to deal with.
And, in addition to the official solver
of problems, there is the R.S.L. repre-
sentative who is ever on his toes,
eager to render assistance and advice
in every way.
The soldier of World War II is well
provided for with planning machinery.
Whether the final results, in these
days of higher costs and improved
standard of living, are as beneficial
to the Digger, seeking to fit himself
into civilian life, of course, is a horse
of a different color. There is, un-
doubtedly, more regimentation and
less of the individual effort; for the
man, lying in his white-enamelled
bedstead week in, week out, turning
his problems over in his unsettled
mind, has grown to lean more heavily
upon the planning experts who offer
to think and act for him.
Visiting-day v
• The most interesting period of Con-
cord life is visiting-day, which is every
day at specified times, excepting Mon-
day. It is during the week-end, when
the gates are opened, that eager rela-
tives and friends storm the building
like bargain-hunters on a Friday
morning. And then, more than at
any other time, is it possible to
appraise the background of one’s
ward-mates. For visitors are not
garbed in the uniform of pyjamas
and dressing-gowns; their individuality
has not been submerged by necessary
hospital discipline and routine.
Through the doors of the big build-
ings they surge, crowding the lifts,
hurrying along the miles of covered
ramps leading to wards, some of
which border on the river. Everyone
eager to see a loved one; to hear the
latest report of the x-ray, the
operation, the blood-test or the
sputum culture; to learn of the prob-
able date of discharge and then, on
the other hand, to tell of all the
exciting home incidents; baby’s new
tooth; little Johnny’s fall down the
steps; the progress of the lettuce
crop in the garden; the sweet-peas
blooming; little Willie’s marks at
school and Maisie’s mumps.
Among the women there are
fashions of every mode; furs and
well-cut tailored costumes, begloved,
high-heeled; a well-worn overcoat ot
many winters, lisle stockings and low-
heeled shoes; the snappy girl-friends
with their nylons and “new looks.
The men in usual careless dress, sports
coats and grey trousers, some carry-
ing suspicious-looking suitcases that
could contain bottles of a kind; but
these are —alas!—examined at the
gateway! ,
Visiting-day is a heyday for both
patients and relatives. Sometimes the
latter realise that old Pop is not so
bright as last week; the pain is more
intense, the cough more racking, and
they depart with heavier hearts than
when they came. And sometimes
there’s a screen around the bed and
the visitors remain after the specified
time for leaving, sitting and waiting,
anxiously, dry-eyed into the small
hours when, invariably, the Reaper
comes and another old soldier fades
away. , ,
But to offset this each day sees a
quota of the pyjama-dressing-gowned
army attired in ordinary street clothes,
a beam of satisfaction lighting up
their faces at the prospect of their
discharge and the knowledge that tne
malaria wog had taken the knock
(temporarily, at any rate), the duo-
denal ulcer had been cured, tne
sputum test had proved negative ana
the old lung had healed.
And so off they go—the old-time
Diggers and their younger mates who
had met in Concord wards to cure
their battle scars; most 9! them witn
grateful memories of kindnesses re-
ceived from sisters, nurses and the
cobbers they must leave behind.
They march out to take up battle-
stations in the war for peace.

was using a pair of fieldglasses owned by
Herbert Power, who raced Merriwee
when it won the Cup in 1896. Though
he had nothing special to offer at the
time about the winner, he did give
an interesting snippet which will be news
to most Australians. Still alive and well

cruising in a motor-boat in Canada, is
Melba’s husband, Charles Armstrong.
Whom the mob cheer! Last week in
London politicians were blaming Mont-
gomery for the failure of England’s re-
cruiting drive. The weekly “John Bull”
asked “whether Montgomery has the
temperament for sudden, fast improvisa-
tion which would certainly be needed
were the Western forces called upon dur-
ing the next two years.” Montgomery!
What wouldn’t the British nation, or the
world, have not given him the day before
Alamein? —the man who from boyhood
had studied war so that he would be
ready when destiny needed him. But
Monty’s notthe first to hear cheers change
to jeers. On V-day in London a wildly-
clamoring crowd cheered Churchill to the
echo ; when he went to the country in July
nowhere was he more soundly defeated
than in London. The same mob that
struggled to cast a worshipping glance on
Wellington, after he’d won the battle that
was to give England 100 years of Euro-
pean peace, later stoned his house. When
Cromwell died he was buried with pomp
among the kings in Westminster. With
the Restoration the man acclaimed as
the breaker of Royal despotism was dug
up and hanged on a Tyburn gibbet.
Abraham Lincoln was more fortunate.
The same assassin’s bullet that caught
him at the height of his popularity
guaranteed his immortality.
Mountbatten is in Malta to take com-
mand of the British First Cruiser
Squadron. An unsinkable man on an un-
sinkable island.
“Trinco”: General Sir William Slim, relieving
Montgomery as Chief of the Imperial General
Staff, became a soldier almost by accident.
By turns an office-boy, usher in a boarding-
school and foreman of a gang in an engineering
works, he answered Kitchener’s call for volun-
teers after the Sarajevo incident, and in no
time was promoted to the rank of acting lance-
corporal in the Royal Warwickshires —Monty’s
old regiment. A commission and a couple of
wounds followed. Slim belies his name, and he
was first knocked when his sturdy, oak-tough
frame led a decimated battalion of his regiment
to the top of Sari Bair in the Dardanelles
fight. Refitted, he was in at the capture of
Bagdad, and came out with M.C. and another
wound. Recuperating in India, he joined the
Gurkhas and stayed there for 25 years. Many
great soldiers are admirable with their own
kind, many are excellent with Indian troops.
Slim was top-class with both. He went with
the Fifth Indian Division to the M.E. and led
a brigade to Eritrea; and was knocked again.
Command of the famous 14th Army in Burma
gave him the chance to use his brilliant tactical
skill, first in retreat, then holding, then in a
series of vicious stabs that took his British
force back over their tracks. His wife fol-
lowed him with the 14th Army hospital. A
diligent student of human nature, Slim’s suc-
cess was attributed as much to his unremitting
study of the Japs in Burma as to his own
native brilliance.
John Pepper is well equipped for the
post to which he has recently succeeded
—head serang of Thos. Cook’s Sydney
branch. For a score of years he has per-
sonally conducted, advised, arranged and
acted as general factotum for tourists
wishing to go from Sydney to Canberra
or from the Cape to Cairo, or any place
in between. When a Bulletin man called
he was arranging a trip across the Pacific
with about the same degree of emotion
as he’d arrange a jaunt to Manly. Per-
sonally conducting tours through the East
Indies before anchoring in the Sydney
office. Pepper’s job ranged from diplo-
matically alternating the best rooms
among his guests to arranging the wed-
ding and honeymoon of two of them. He
organised the trips of the last Test team,
the Olympic team and the Kangaroos,
now in England; and his proudest boast
is that he’s never lost a man.
A mixed grill was called to
the bar in Melbourne recently. Adrian
Riordan, of Sydney, was a lieut.-
colonel in the permanent staff corps.
He retired in 1943 after 24 years’
service and began law then. Gordon
Just comes from a legal family, five of
whom are now practising law. Charles
Francis is a composer, and in the last
dust-up was a commissioned air-gunner,
“Fitz”: Recent reference to Norman Lindsay
having drawn the pictures for Dulcie Deamer’s
first yarn in the old “Lone Hand” is a re-
minder that it is close to 50 years since Norman
made his debut as a Bulletin artist. On the
“Red Page” of August 18, 1900, there is re-
printed a pair of bookplates, two of a set which
Norman had on show at the N.S.W. Society of
Artists’ rooms in Sydney. Also on show there
was a set of Lindsay pen-drawings illustrating
Boccaccio’s Decameron, which The Bulletin
art-critic of the day said were “the finest ex-
amples of pen-draughtsmanship yet produced
in this country.” In the following issue his
own likeness of himself appeared—also on the
“Red Page”—sandwiched between a short account
of the 21-year-old Creswick-(Vic.)-born artist by
“an enthusiastic (not undiscriminating) friend.”
Norman’s “enthusiastic” friend described him as
“keen of face, luminous of eye, slim and wiry of
figure, strangely resembling the early portraits
of Albrecht Diirer The very reincarnation
of the ancient artist-craftsman —one of those
merry painters of Verona He has done
enough already to give the solidest promise of
ripe years to come.” In the same issue appears.
Norman’s first Bulletin contribution, a draw-
ing showing a larrikin and his “donah” on a
park-jbench above a poem, “A Bush Rondeau,”
by Peter Airey, beginning:
“Why don’t yer squeeze yer gal a bit?” said she.
“Why don’t yer pull and haul me fair ’n free ?
For all your bloomin’ gas ‘Yer love me so.’
Yer spoonin’ style / reckon bloomin’ slow.” >
Further efforts from Norman’s pen quickly saw
print in The Bulletin. He tilted at Melbourne
Sundays, the aftermath of the Melbourne Cup,
and women who wrongly accuse men of crimin-
ally assaulting them, and he illustrated a number
of poems, including a piece called “Where the
Beer Bottles Grow,” Rod Quinn’s “Footprints,”
a bit about a boundary-rider who came to town
“to have a little burst,” and “Jiggitty Jane.”
Jane was a 54-year-old streetwalker —“Twelve
convictions, and drunk again!”—headed for a
pauper’s grave, and might have served as the
original for “N.L.’s” famous “Trio” printed
in 1906. His first full-page drawing, an illus-
tration of Victor Daley’s “The Poet and the
Muse,” was featured in the 1900 Christmas
number, and three weeks later there came his
illustration of Quinn’s widely-quoted “The Camp
Within the West.” By September 21 of the
following year he had invaded the front page
with a political cartoon entitled “The Price of
Glory.” Why doesn’t some publisher bring out
a book of Norman’s drawings for verse?

Daley’s “Vision of Calvary,” Jimmy Edmond’s
“Prodigals,” McCrae’s “Gallant Captain

verse by Mabel Forrest and “Kodak.”
Grand opera without a grand chorus
wouldn’t be half so grand, and here pre-
sented by Mcßeath is Haydn James, the
young chorus-master of J.C.W.’s current
opera, whose training of the Australian
chorus has produced high praise from all
quarters. Trained in a hard school of
musicianship, covering every branch of
the art through 26 years of apprentice-
ship, James was for many years the
A.B.C.’s Theatre Orchestra conductor,.
and among other jobs had the arranging

war he turned down offers from the
Services to use his ability for. entertain-
ment purposes and worked hard to make
air-crew grade. Trained in Canada, he
eventually flew in action with the 52nd
Wing at Morotai and points north. On
discharge, and prior to accepting his
present post, he was production-manager
for Broadcasting Exchange. A boxer’s
nose and cauliflower ear suggest that
pianos are not the only things he has
thumped.
In Melbourne the other day Horace
Stevens, Covent Garden bass-baritone
who was considered by some to be among
the greatest interpreters of Wagnerian
Opera, sahg his own anthem at a special
seafarers’ service in St. Paul’s. Named
after the psalm They That Go Down to
the Sea in Ships, he wrote it for his son,
Kemble, who, in the last scrap, com-
manded ships in North Sea and Atlantic
convoys. A choirboy at All Saints, St.

'Franz Lehar, who passed on to the
music of the spheres from his home at
Bad Ischel, near Vienna, was studying the
violin when Dvorak advised him to stick
to composition. The result was a light
opera, “The Merry Widow,” which, first
played at the Theatre-an-der-Wien in
December, 1905, went oh to 5000 perform-
ances in America and over 1000 in Lon-
don, Paris, Berlin and Vienna. In Buenos
Aires it ran simultaneously in five
theatres in five different languages. Three
years later Melbourne was whistling
“Vilia” and the famous waltz. Of the
play, with Carrie Moore singing “Sonia,”
Edmund Fisher, The Bulletin’s show-
man of the time, wrote:
It grew in a few short minutes from an
idea into an idol,' and has become a
synonym for daintiness and girl. While the
music is a lingering stream of languor and
charm, girl, with all her riches of pinkness
and warmth, clusters and scintillates on the
fat, bare body of the yarn.
The “Count of Luxemburg” and “Gipsy
Love” also found their measure of fame
overseas, and as late as 1936 Lehar’s
“Fredericke” was first presented in New
York. Three years earlier he had been
blacklisted as an anti-Nazi, but his musical
eminence—Hitler saw “The Merry
Widow” three times in the same week —
guaranteed him immunity, and he was later
“cleared.” Portion of his considerable
assets were willed to maintain his home
at Bad Ischel as a shrine to his Jewish
wife’s memory.

Among these distinctions is the
possibly more memorable—and certainly
unique—one that battleship Ramillies
postponed her sailing for him when, as a
young lieutenant, he was hurrying to join
her from cruiser Sydney for the trip out
to Australia in 1935. As commander of
Shropshire he had the pleasure of
looking after the mixed bag of male
and female ranks and ratings of the
Victory contingent. In America he will
renew many Pacific-made acquaintances
among the U.S. 7th Fleet.
Adelaide ’Varsity’s retiring pathology
professor, John Cleland, is probably the
only pathologist in Australia to have had
at his fingertips comprehensive knowledge
of nearly every branch of his subject.
With the pathology of man, animals and
plants his field ranged from the identifi-
cation of the mosquito which carries
dengue fever in Northern Australia to
new varieties of birds, and the discovery
that the abo. has only two blood-groups,
as compared with whites’ four, which he
puts down to JBinghi not having interbred
with other races for thousands of
years. Once, when a young doctor
in Westralia, Qeland tried his hand at
detective work. Performing an autopsy
on a 12-year-old boy whom he thought
may have died from an unidentified
disease, he was impelled, by the intent
callousness with which-a woman, insistent
on being present, watched the operation,
to open the lad’s stomach. He found that
the boy had been slowly poisoned by
diluted hydrochloric acid, given by the
woman as a throat gargle. Her morbid
interest hanged her.
Into the silence:
In Perth, John Simons, the man who intro-
duced thousands of Australian lads—many of
them now leading professional men—to lands
overseas they would never normally have
sighted, through the Young Australia League
he founded over 40 years ago. In turn a com-
pelling orator, hon. major in the Canadian
forces, president of A.N.A., M.L.A. and pub-
lisher, Simons was a big man, and most of it
was heart.
At 56, in Adelaide, Douglas Gordon, of Mt.
Crawford, and M.L.C. for Midland division
in S.A. Elder son of knight David Gordon,
he helped to found the Liberals’ Federal Council,
raised sheep and cattle in N.S.W. and the far
north of S.A., and was at Gallipoli.
At Newcastle (N-S.W.), Dr. Wilfred Nickson,
one of the State’s oldest medicoes. Graduating
at Dublin University, he toured the Continent
and met Louis Pasteur and Dr. Koch. He
came to Australia in 1886. A surgeon-com-
mander in the R.A.N. for a time —his commis-
sion was signed by Henry Parkes —most of his
services were given to Newcastle General Hos-
pital, in recognition of which the directors have
named the new £500,000 wing after him.

poet and author of Disraeli’s biography. Viola
Meynell, the novelist, is his daughter.
In Perth, at 75, Philip Collier, who was W.A.
Premier for two terms, in 1924-30 and in 1933-

in 1904 and broke into politics as member for
Boulder the following year.


Women's letters
From Sydney
Soft as a snowdrift are the two white
hand-woven wool pram-covers which will
be air-mailed by the Country Women’s
Association to H.R.H. Princess Elizabeth,
this week. Also in the parcel will go
bassinet and cot blankets which the
Princess has accepted. All were woven
by the president of the Wollongong
branch, Mrs. W. Hatfield.
Legacy Torchbearers held a real dqlls’
tea-party last Wednesday afternoon. This
rounded off the doll competition, which
brought in no fewer than 350 entries.
Each was gone over, dress, undies, hat
and all, by three eagle-eyed judges: Mrs.
W. Harrison, president of Torch Bearers,
Elizabeth Osborne, of the A.8.C., and
Coral Wood, of 2UE. The dolls had
been dressed by pupils of P.L.C., Croy-
don, and P.L.C., Pymble, S.C.E.G.G.S.,
Darlinghurst, and the Girls’ High Schools
at Neutral Bay and North Sydney.
A bright-faced little guest at the party
was Nola Thorne, of P.L.C., Pymble,
who won the first prize for the best-
dressed doll. Hers was an exquisite
“baby”—all muslin and lace. Victoria
Jaasen, of North Sydney High, got the
prize for her Esthonian doll. There was
an alert young cricketer, blazer, cap,
knitted pullover and all, and a Girl Guide
complete with pack on back. There were
girl poppets of every nationality, and,
of course, there was a bride with veil
and orange-blossom. There was a Red
Cross nurse, and there were some dressed
all in woollies as though set for the snow
country. The whole display is a grand
advertisement for the methods of needle-
craft taught in our schools. The
350 dolls will be on sale at Torchbearers’
fete at Elaine on Nov. 13. Mrs. Dorothy
Wood, the fete president, hopes you will
come and help to applaud the winners,
who will then be presented with their
prizes.
The Cymmrodorion Society of Sydney
had a golden wedding in the family
recently. The gaieties were in the Pick-
wick Club, and the guests of honor were
vice-president James John Jenkins and his
bride of 50 years ago. Every county in
Wales and Monmouth was represented,
so that the congratulations may be said
to have quite a national flavor. Also
present were sons organist and pianist
Idwal Jenkins, known to A.B.C. listeners,
and brother Elfed, equally known on
2SM. Old friend of the family Elystan-
Price, president of the society, was the
night’s chairman. At a Jenkins family
celebration of the golden anniversary the
previous week, Elizabeth Osborne, of the
A.B.C. Argonauts Session, and Idwal
Jenkins received quite a few congratula-
tions themselves. They had announced
their engagement that day.
Pretty brown-haired Patricia Howes,
of Mosman, and Phil Prior, of the same
suburb, announced their engagement last
week-end. This is the second engage-
ment-ring this paper has had in the family
this year —Phil is the youngest son of
H. K. Prior, managing-director of The
Bulletin.
If you are in the running, and aren’t
going to the Melbourne Cup, then you’re
going to some one of the many Maisie
Grieg parties. With her husband, Max
Murray, she is being rushed. The two
will be the guests of the P.E.N. during
next month. Old friend Mrs. W. Holman
(daughter Portia is a close friend of
Maisie’s) is pouring cocktails for them on
the fifth, and on Wednesday, November 3,
they will be the guests at lunch of the
Australian Book Society. At this lunch
the two will discuss “the business end of
writing in America.” These two writers,
who have gained secure footing in Eng-
land, intend to stay in their homeland
some time before going on to U.S., where
their work is already known.
Literature was in the ascendant with
both the Women Pioneers and the Thurs-
day afternoon circle of the English-
Speaking Union last week. There was a
great assembly of Women Pioneers in
their clubrooms on Thursday evening to
hear Dr. George Mackaness’s clever dis-
course on “Cradles of Australian Litera-
ture” and Colin Roderick’s talk
on Australian .novelists. The evening
lecture is quite a breakaway for this
club, but the descendants of the first
colonists took to it as avidly as young
ducks take to water. President Mrs. R.
Vallack introduced the speakers very
aptly.
King John was the Shakspearean play
chosen by Father T. Walshe, S.J., for his
lecture to the E.-S.U. members in Anthony
Hordern’s. He chose it because through
it the spirit of England breathes. He
chose jt because of its poetry, and prob-
ably because it is a play showing the
strength of mother love—in the one case,
of course, so wrongly directed. Dorothy
Smith, just back from Gunnedah, was in
the chair. Her black-and-white-patterned
crepes with their Quaker-like sheer linen
collar held the freshness of spring, and
nothing at all of the rain-spattered dust-
storm raging outside. Mrs. H. J. Brady
and Mrs. Prescott were the afternoons
thanksgivers,
Norda Rutkewitz is a pleasant, slim
woman, more like a ballet dancer in
appearance than a dress-designer. Her
frocks for day and evening wear mingle
imagination and reality in just the correct
dosage for Australian women. At the
parade of her models last Thursday even-
ing in the Savarin to help »Diana
Gregory’s candidature for Miss Australia,
she displayed frocks and suits just right
for the hot season now upon us. There
was one suit of white brocaded moire,
the skirt plainly cut gaining its stretch
from some pleats in the front, the hip-
length jacket moulded to the figure. This,
worn with a blouse of sheerest white,
would* rivet all eyes at any reception.
Masterlinck’s “Blue Bird,” which had
a trial flight yesterday, will be pre-

There were incantations from Mac-
beth around a special witches’ brew up
in Jean Garling’s flat last Sunday after-
noon. Jean threw a party in the true
Halloween spirit with 13 guests, witch
millinery and other signs and portents.
One sign of the times was the absence
of pumpkin faces. With pumpkin at Is.
a pound, only a millionairess could orna-
ment her table with them. But oranges
scooped out made a good substitute —
especially as they were filled with home-
made sweets. Incidentally, there didn’t
seem to be a broomstick on the premises,
either.

arena. As the teams entered the field to
play each captain handed the opposing
captain a posy of flowers. But the Spanish

All the newest wonders of the age were
glimpsed by, the voyager from Aus-
tralia: helicopters, jet-propelled planes,
television. She was present at the
Olympic Games, saw the Davis Cup
matches at The Hague, the Wightman
Cup matches, the Curtis Cup golf
matches. She went to Aldershot to see
the equestrian tests, and saw more
monocled riders and the grandest exhibi-
tion of riding she had ever seen.
But the size of the Toronto Fair
still holds wonderment for her. It
is our R.A.S. magnified a hundredfold.
A gargantuan display on a stage 300 yards
long, arranged by Olsen and Johnson,

From Melbourne
All the atmosphere of Flemington was
captured in the decorations *at Earl’s
Court for the Derby Eve Ball organised
by Lady Gullett and her capable com-
mittee to raise funds for the Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Re-
plicas of galloping horses, bookmakers’
umbrellas and owners’ colors were used,
and on a huge backdrop was painted the
scene so familiar to Melbourne race-
goers. During the evening an advance
running of the Derby was featured, the
wooden horses being “ridden” by well-
known Melburnians. On every table in
the ballroom were miniature horses
carrying racing colors. President of the
ball committee, Mrs. Chester Guest, wore
a bouffant gown of cigar-brown tulle
embroidered with gold sequins. Lady
Gullett’s slinTfitting gown in duck-egg
blue was splashed with a floral design.
Mrs. Bowen Pain’s russet-brown tulle
gown was on bouffant lines. Mrs. Bill
Gluth allied primrose tulle and gold
taffeta effectively. Among Sydney visitors
were Mrs. Lionel McFadyen, whose
black-taffeta gown was trimmed with
turquoise blue. Mrs, Hugh Birch wore
an off-the-shoulder gown of floral satin.
Techa Matear chose black tulle. Mrs.
Norman Robinson’s slim tailored frock
of white crepe was embellished with an
all-over pattern of silver beads, Mrs.
Donald Mackinnon was coolness personi-
fied in white floral-printed chiffon. Pink
roses circled the waist of Peggy Fraser’s
black Chantilly lace gown. Black lace
banded the wide skirt of Mrs. Edmund
Alcock’s white georgette gown. Mrs.
Bruce Rose’s slim-fitting gown was of
floral satin.
Even the expected rain on Derby day
did not deter women from wearing the
loveliest hats seen at Flemington since
pre-war days, Roses and exotic flowers
were favorites for large hats ; there were
small skull-caps trimmed with flowers
and feathers and tied under the chin with
veiling or ribbon, and quite a number
of bonnets were weighed down with
ostrich feathers. Soft blue was visible
under Lady Herring’s tailored black coat,
which was worn with a small black hat
trimmed with small blue feathers. Lady
Binney’s off-white wool tailored coat was
topped with a small quill-trimmed beret
in the same material. A raisin-red and
white-spotted jacket-suit of corded silk
and a matching hat trimmed with gros-
grain were Lady Currie’s smart contribu-
tion to the scene. Mrs. T. C. Manifold,
of the vice-chairman of the V.R.C.,
entertained the vice-regal party at
luncheon in a black ensemble to which
was added silver-fox furs and a soft black
tulle hat.
Adelaide visitor Mrs. J. Elliott Murray
chose a soft-green ensemble and a match-
ing hat tied under the chin with veiling.
Mrs. Charles Davis sported an umbrella
of Cameron tartan with her grey tailored
jacket suit and white flat beret. Mrs. Bill
Moses wore a large black hat with her
royal-blue tailored coat. Mrs. Sam
Hordern teamed a draped navy frock and
wide-brimmed matching straw hat. Mrs.
Tom Rutledge’s brick-red Duvetyn coat
was worn with a small white hat. Mrs.
Denis Allen had pink daisies clustered in
front of her small white hat which was
worn with a grey coat. Creamy roses
trimmed the large white hat which Mrs.
Ronnie Nott wore with her black faille
tailored frock. The Marina-blue of Mrs.
Arthur Laver’s pleated jacket-suit was
repeated as trimming for her black hat.
A grey tailored suit and matching hat
were worn by Mrs. Ron Cameron. Her
daughter Keera had quills to trim her
cocoa-brown felt hat, the tone of which
was duplicated in her lamb coat. Mrs.
F. J. Dempsey trimmed her black hat
with pink - and - black - spotted taffeta
ribbon; her coat was dyed-ermine. A
pleated panel was set into the front of
the skirt of Mrs. W. Seymour’s beige
frock. Mrs. Everard Baillieu’s caramel
suit had a flared peplum at the waist;
her shallow-crowned hat was of black
straw. With her soft green suit Mrs. L. R.
Buxton wore a small green hat which had
red velvet and a large rose for trimming.
Some lovely national gowns were
worn at the buffet dinner - party
given by members of the Chinese
Citizens’ Association in Victoria to
honor the first Chinese Ambassador
to Australia, Dr. N. K. Kan, and
Mada’me Kan. Venue for the party
was the Australia’s Venetian Court, and
guests were received by the president of
the association, Shun S. H. Linn, and the
secretary, G. Wing Dan. Madame Kan’s
gown of rich grey-blue satin was em-
broidered in plum tones at the high
neckline and slit skirt. Madame Wang,
wife of the Chinese Consul, chose a rich
off-white satin gown embroidered in a
cherry design. Mrs. Linn’s sea-green
gown was heavily embossed and the
sleeves and skirt were draped. Mrs. A.
Drakeford’s black gown had gold-sequin
trimmings. Mrs. Collins, wife of Admiral
Collins, wore a gold-and-rose brocade
gown which had a bouffant skirt and
narrow shoulder-straps. Mrs. Trevor
Oldham’s long-sleeved white crepe
dinner gown was richly trimmed with
gold sequins. Mrs. Arthur Warner chose
pale-lilac crepe ornamented with clusters
of silver beads in a flower design on the
shoulders. Mrs. W. K. Burnside’s deep-
biirgundy gown was embellished with
tiny diamente beads on shoulders and
bodice. Lady Knox covered, her evening-
gown with a hip-length jacket of pale-
green satin. Real pink rosebuds were
wreathed about the neck of Mrs. C. A.
Clowes’s pastel-blue gown. Mrs. David
Ting wore a pencil-slim black satin skirt
with a gold lame tunic. Jean Wing Dan’s
gold lame ballerina skirt was topped with
a black-velvet bodice. A high tortoise-
shell comb was worn by Mrs. Conrad
Charlton with her black floral satin gown.
Maree Adele, only child of Mr. and
Mrs. R. N. Raymond, of South Yarra,
who was married at Wesley Church to
John Alderson, only son of Mrs. Irene
Abraham, of Glen Iris, and the late Mr.
I. A. Abraham, chose for her gown a
fragile white Chantilly lace, which was
made over shell-pink net. The skirt was
bouffant, and the bodice featured an off-
the-shoulder line. Her billowy white
tulle veil was held by a pearl tiara. Her
cousins, Phyllis and Betty Hare, were
bridesmaids; their full-skirted white
organdie frocks were worn with tiny bon-
nets fashioned of the same material,
trimmed with flowers and tied under the
chin with pink-taffeta ribbon. Best man
was Nigel Manning.
Later Mr. and Mrs. Raymond enter-
tained more than 150 guests at a buffet
dinner-party at the Australia. Gold
sequins trimmed the bodice and hip-line
of Mrs. Raymond’s black dinner-gown ;
her black-tulle halo hat was highlighted
with white ospreys. Mrs. Abraham chose
a soft-grey lace gown and contrasting
blue hat, Sydney visitors included Mrs.
John Roles, whose white gown was
printed with large red roses and green
leaves. Mrs. H. Pugliese’s black gown
was trimmed with multicolored sequins ;
her large hat was a frothy affair of black
lace and tulle. Ivy Parker’s gown was of
ice-blue slipper satin, the skirt fully
pleated, the bodice trimmed with French-
pink roses outlined with gold and opales-
cent beads. A rose-pink pleated petticoat
peeped from under the full black skirt
of the dinner-gown chosen by Mrs. Ted
Biggs. Mrs. Ronnie Nott’s black-taffeta
gown had a heart-shaped neckline massed
with black sequins, which were repeated
on the hem of her bouffant skirt. Mrs.
Len Paddle’s taffeta gown was russet-
toned. Royal-blue crepe was Mary
Morris’s choice. Mrs. Eric Cottrell wore
a gown of turquoise-blue crepe; her
sister, Mrs. Norman Spry, favored a full-
skirted frock of rich ruby-red velvet.
Novelty at the party given in the
Matthew Lang Cellars by Fred Wyeth
and James Bowen Pain, to which were
bidden 150 guests, was the hat parade
compered by Ivy Parker. The co-hosts
and Mrs. Botften Pain received the guests,
among whom were Mrs. Gordon Chirn-
side, whose black velvet hat highlighted
with pink satin coin-dotted in black was
worn with a smartly-draped black silk
jersey frock. Diamente buttons fastened
the black satin tailored frock worn by
Mrs. lan Potter ; her bonnet of caramel-
toned velvet was shirred under the brim
with water-lily-green velvet. An off-white
ballibuntal Regency hat trimmed with
black velvet and veiling made neat effect
for Mrs. Edric Henty’s black frock, the
skirt of which showed the petticoat line.
Lady Clarke set off her black Persian-
lamb coat with a black-and-white-striped
taffeta boater trimmed with red roses.
Sage-green ostrich-feathers on a matching
hat provided contrast for Mrs. J. V. Fair-
bairn’s dyed-ermine coat. Mrs. Isobel
Green’s aqua-blue frock, trimmed with
clusters of white beads, was worn with a
black coat; her royal-blue satin hat was
trimmed with green and royal-blue
ostrich-feathers. Gardenias were pre-
sented to every woman guest by pretty
girls dressed in race frocks which had
been worn by smart women at the turn
of the century.

whereby A.P.P. becomes sole owner of
A.P.M.’s £2,200,000 of ord. capital. The
deal raised A.P.P.’s paid capital from
£1,891,631 in 228,500 8 p.c. prefs. and
1,663,131 ords. to £2,474,562 in 437,611
8 p.c. prefs. and 2,036,951 ords.
Having decided to make from Aus-
tralian timbers much of the pulp pre-
viously imported, the operating co.
erected a new mill for the purpose at
Maryvale (Vic.) just before the war, and
fast-running machines to turn out high-
grade wrapping papers, container board
and a variety of related products were set
up alongside. To meet the outlay in this
and other directions, £1,970,000 of fresh
capital, which brought in £lOB,OOO of
share premiums, was gathered over the
half-dozen years to end June, 1941. That
raised A.P.M.’s paid capital to £3,200,000,
of which £1,000,000 —held direct by the
public—carries a cumulative 6 p.c.
War provided fresh opportunities, of
which the management has made the
most, and £2,250,000 of 3| p.c. debenture
money was raised a couple of years ago
to help finance additions the five oper-
ating mills —Maryvale, Melbourne, Fair-
field and Broadford (Vic.) and Botany
(N.S.W.). To see the big programme of
expansion to completion—scarcities and
delays in delivery of equipment, etc.,
have hindered progress—the co. has just
received Treasury approval to raise nearly
million of share and debenture money
over the next couple of years.
Of the new money A.P.M. itself is to
raise £1,000,000 by issue of debentures
privately, on terms not yet announced.
A.P.P. offered those on* its register (prefs.
and ords.) at Oct. 30 1,979,851 new £1
ords. at 255. each. When all the money
on that lot is in, A.P.P.’s paid capital will
be £4,454,212 in £1 shares—4,ol6,Bo2
ords. and the balance prefs. The pref.
div. and 6 p.c. to the ords. will then call
for £276,016. That is £52,253 less than
A.P.M. netted last term, after deducting
its own pref. requirements. But the new
share and premium capital will need to
earn (net) at only half the rate of A.P.M-’s
existing funds to more than fill the gap.
And it is probable that the new debenture
money will turn in more than its keep.
Appearances are, therefore, that current
rates of divs. in both operating and holding
cos. are not likely to be interfered with.
The market priced A.P.P.’s ords. at
375. and the prefs, at 425., cum rights.
The net price, after exercising'the rights
and allowing for brokerage, is 31s. 9d.
ords. and 345. 6d. prefs., giving a return
of 3.9 p.c. and 4.6 p.c. respectively on the
basis of last term’s distributions. A.P.M.’s
prefs. at 30s. yield 4 p.c.; they enjoy a
wider margin of cover for both divs. and
capital.
Last term A.P.M.’s overall production
(128,480 tons) stepped up 3985 tons,
thanks partly to a full year’s output from
the remodelled board mill at Botany, and
partly to continuous running of the Vic-
torian mills following use of brown coal.
The effects of wage increases and the 40-
hour week were largely offset by a lift in
controlled selling prices. And there was
a saving of £31,309 in the tax bill
(£199,950), owing to abolition of War-
time (Co.) Tax. After setting aside an
extra £27,695 for depreciation (£369,893)
and allowing for minor reserve adjust-
ments, the net result was £13,874 better
at £283,763. That covered the pref. div,
and 10.1 p.c. on ord. capital as against
9.5, 7.6, 9, 8.9 and 8.8 p.c. back to 1943.
The year’s profit, plus debenture interest,
was 5.9 p.c. on debenture and share
capital and reserves combined ; so the de-
bentures are earning a lot more than their
keep.

1948.. 42,178 Nil 66,680'
The loss, second and biggest thing of its
kind since the old Hunter River and New-
castle S.S. cos. merged their interests in
the present organisation, is evidence of
the shocking mess into which Govern-
ment control has landed Australian
coastal shipping. The position, however,
is not quite so bad as the last line in the
table suggests. The £42,178 is subject to
a claim against the Shipping Board, in
respect of which an interim payment of
£lO,OOO has been received since the close
of accounts, and a further substantial
sum is expected. Still, no allowance was
made for depreciation of the fleet, nor
has been for several years ; but the ships
have been maintained in good running
order.
Factors mainly responsible for the un-
profitable trading were: (1) the slow
turn-round of ships, owing to shortage of
labor, go-slow tactics and industrial dis-
putes ; (2) rapidly mounting costs, fol-
lowing all-round and recurrent wage lifts,
introduction of the 40-hour week and
rise in prices of stores, etc,; and (3) the
damaging time-lag in officially controlled
freight rates, which are running a losing
race with costs. All these things hit cos,
operating short intra-State runs much
harder than the big inter-State concerns,
because of the relative time their re-
spective ships spend in the bottleneck
ports, where the “darg” is now as much
in evidence as it is on the coalfields.
Increased freight rates to help offset
the effects of the 40-hour week, Stevedor-
ing Commission’s levy and wage lifts,
etc., which have operated since the be-
ginning of 1947, were granted only a few
weeks ago. Meanwhile, the continued
advance of wages and prices has made
yet further increase in freight rates im-
perative, if a moderate profit is to be
earned on capital employed during the
current term. The co, has also to meet
competition from the railways, whose
freight charges within specified areas can
be kept low by imposition of blanket
rates.
Results for the current term will largely
depend upon the promptness, or other-
wise, with which the Government adjusts
freight rates, and upon a quicker turn-
round of the ships, which, in turn, largely
depends upon the amount of wharf-
labor available. In this connection a sub-
stantial measure of relief would follow
if the co. had the right to select and
engage permanent wharf-labor from
union members, instead of the present
method of daily pick-up from the pool.
Under existing conditions, this and other
shipping cos. on the N. S. Wales coast
are steadily consuming their capital; a
state of affairs that cannot long con-
tinue.
The co.’s four requisitioned ships were
returned in Dec. last —one, the Karuah,
has been retained in the Tasmanian trade
at tlie request of the Shipping Board.

The co. has been in the woolbroking,
pastoral-finance, agenqy and merchandis-
ing business in Queensland since * the
end of last century. It was record prices
for wool and livestock, assisted by re-
covery of bad debts (£8737, Up £6167),
that put the spring of £10,077 in last
term’s net earnings, which were also a
record. Seasonal conditions, bad in the
previous term, were mixed. They were
fair to good over the southern half of
the State, but patchy to bad in the
northern half, where serious losses of
livestock have occurred.
The volume of wool and livestock
handled by the co. last term were below
aver&ge, owing to the effects of drought;

However, Australia’s wool cheque last
season (£ 155-odd million, up £63-odd
million) was the biggest ever, the overall
average being 39.97 d. a pound, which
was 59 p.c. above the previous year’s
average and three times the average for
the five years to end June, 1939.
Including debt recoveries, the spring in
gross earnings (£81,204) was £23,111.
Growth in exes. (£57,102) was £13,034,
of which £B3OO was in respect of tax
provision (£16,600). The £24,102 of
profit was 15 p.c. on capital as against
8.7, 9.3, 9.2, 9.8, 11, 6.9 and 6.6 p.c.
back to 1941. A 4 p.c, bonus was sent
out with the 8 p.c. div., making 12 p.c.
for the year. Average distribution over
the last dozen years was 6.9 p.c. And a
25 p.c. rebate of commissions on wool,
fat stock and produce makes the de-
clared rate of div. worth more to share-
holders who are also clients.
As for the current term, good winter
rains have again brightened the outlook
for pastoralists in the southern half of
the State. But dry conditions continue
in the north and central-west, where
practically no agistment is available, there
is little, if any, water to be had on many
stock-routes, transport is scarce and dear,
and the dingo, blowfly and Noogoora
burr are other troubles. At auction
there has been strong demand for all
sound Merino and fine crossbred wools at
good prices, but bids for stronger grades
have eased a little. However, with the
statistical position of the staple steadily
improving, thanks to good clearances of
J.O. stocks, the immediate outlook favors
maintenance of a high level of earnings.
Average Australian price (greasy and
scoured combined for the first three
months of the current season was 45.9 d.
a pound, or 40.1 p.c. above the average
for the corresponding period of the pre-
vious season.
But costs are still rising and prices
cannot be expected,to continue at present
levels indefinitely. The market assesses
the risks by pricing the f.-p. pound shares
at 355. 9d. as against 31s. lOd. a year or
so ago. The return at 355. 9d. is 6.7
p.c. so long as the 12 p.c. distribution
continues, or 4.5 p.c. should the rate
drop to 8 p.c., which appears a reason-
able long-term anticipation. Net tan-
gible cover is 31s. sd.

Actually the shrinkage in last term’s
profit was greater than the figures in the
table suggest. Earnings for 1947 were
charged with War-time (Co.) Tax, later
abolished in respect of that year, hence
the transfer of £5OOO from tax provision
to reserves last term. Nevertheless the
£34,431 (down £890) of profit claimed was
a . heartening result, considering the
obstacles in the path. It was 13.6 p.c.
on capital as against 14, 14.1, 12.5, 11.6,
11,6 and 6.3 p.c. back to 1942, when a
combination of war developments reduced
ordinary commercial activity to a low
ebb. The figure was written after allow-
ing £21,575 (down £5421) for taxation,
the usual £2OOO for depreciation and
spending whatever was considered neces-
sary on maintenance, etc., a hungry
animal in this class of business. The div.
was kept at Hi p.c. for the third year
in succession, compared with an average
of 8.5 p.c. for the seven years before
that.
It was the bar and lounge trade that
stiffened the figures: i this notwithstand-
ing Sydney’s brewery strike, which inter-
fered with beer deliveries during part of
the last half of the term. Guest occu-
pancy was satisfactory, and the Prices
Commissioner granted a small increase
in tariff charges. Yet the catering service
again showed a loss; that was because
the gain from increased charges, and

more besides, was swallowed by
the steep rise in costs following
recurrent wage-lifts, the effects
of the 40-hour week and bigger
bills for foodstuffs, etc.
Without further increases in
tariff and liquor charges, which
are controlled, turnover appears
to have reached its peak, or
thereabouts. Certainly incomes
of those in the primary indus-
tries, for whom the Metropole
is a popular rendezvous, remain
buoyant—thanks to a good sea-
son and fat prices—and employ-
ment continues at the full at
high and rising wage-rates, all of
which augur well for spending
and maintenance of turnover.
Exactly how long current infla-
tionary conditions will continue
nobody can say at the moment.
What can be said is that there
is a limit to savings that can be
made on the organisational, or
management, side and that new
increases in costs are likely to be
reflected in hotel profits. Ade-
quate relief from the onerous
burden of co. taxation and/or
adjustment of hotel charges
would relieve the position.
When materials and labor be-
come available, renovations and
renewals will call for consider-
able outlay, which the co. is
well-equipped to meet this
means much so far as service,
comfort and goodwill are con-
cerned :

this co., whose mine lies between
Perseverance and Lake View on
the Kalgoorlie Golden Mile,
treated 396,626 tons (up 13,642
tons) of s.o9dwt. ore for
92,7090 z. (up 41510 z.) fine gold,
a recovery of 91.7 p.c. After
allowing for* depreciation
(£21,740) and taxation (£52,104)
the profit was £34,956 (down
£13,303). The drop was due
mainly to a rise of 7d. to 355. 3d.
a ton in mining and treatment
costs, which have continued on
the up-grade since the close of
accounts; The 25 p.c. div., less
tax, took £34,375, same as for
the previous year. English in-
come tax of 9s. in the £, makes
the 25 p.c. worth only 13i p.c.

man. The idea was to relieve
Australian shareholders, who
own most of the scrip, of the
English income tax already re-
ferred to. The British Treasury
had previously refused approval
for the change in domicile.
At end 1947 ore reserves were
put at 2,386,867 tons, averaging
5.3dwt,, a decrease of 61,941
tons and O.ldwt. respectively
over the twelvemonth. Most
promising development was at
the 3100 ft. level, where 150 ft. of
B.sdwt. ore, showing a little free
gold and telluride, was exposed
over a width of 58 inches. When
the books closed current assets
totalled £383,290 and current
liabilities £127,227. Paid capital

AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED
INDUSTRIES LIMITED
CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS AT ANNUAL MEETING OF
SHAREHOLDERS HELD ON 29/9/’4B
In the absence of the Chairman, Major-General H. W. Grimwade,
the Acting Chairman (Sir Alexander Stewart) took the chair and during
the course of his remarks said: —
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Profit of the Parent Company to
June 30, 1948, was £379,167 compared
with £376,964 for .the previous year.
Dividends of 8 per cent, per annum
on the Ordinary Shares and 9 per
cent, on the Preference Shares, ab-
sorbing £374,649, were paid, the
Ordinary dividend being 1 per cent,
higher than for the previous year.
The Consolidated profit is £476,515,
which is less than the 1947 figures by
£3,465, and represents a return of 5.2
per cent, on average Shareholders’
funds employed.
It is interesting that, for the first
time, the total assets of the Group
now amount to £11,035,931. When
the first Consolidated accounts were
published in 1940, the total assets
were £7,751,935, so that, in eight
years, there has been an increase of
£3,283,996.
I mentioned last year that we had
sold much of our holdings of Gov-
ernment Stock, and you will see that
we now own only £244,456 worth.
Our investments in shares in other
companies are substantial, but are
principally in companies where we
have definite interests and, in many
cases, a share in the management.
These holdings are of considerable
value to our organisation.
LIQUID FUNDS
The Consolidated accounts this year
show a bank overdraft of £317,063.
Since the payment of the dividend
to Shareholders in July last, the
aggregate overdraft in Australia and
New Zealand has increased to approxi-
mately £550,000.
The board, therefore, has decided
to carry out its intention, as indicated
last year, of issuing more shares.
We have received approval from
the Capital Issues Control to issue
448,623 Ordinary Shares of £1 each
at a premium of 295. per share. The
new shares cannot be offered to
Shareholders until the close of the
current Commonwealth Loan, pro-
bably about the end of October.
Proceeds of the issue will provide
capital for new industries upon which
your Board has decided, in addition
to extension and re-equipment of
existing ones.
GLASS FACTORIES
(a) CONTAINERS
(I) Australia, and New Zealand:
During the year turnover was the
largest in our.history, and would have
been greater had we not experienced
a severe shortage of labor. The year
was also adversely affected by the
shortage of coal and other important
manufacturing materials. These un-
favorable factors meant that produc-
tion was much below our plant
capacity.
Since the introduction of the' 40-
hour week our production difficulties
have been accentuated. At the same
time there has been no reduction in
operating costs. It is our policy to
overcome increased costs by economic
developments, and for years we suc-
ceeded, but lately have been com-
pelled to adjust selling prices to com-
pensate for increased costs.
At present we are constructing in
Sydney and Melbourne two new glass
furnaces, each of which will deliver
150 tons of glass per 24 hours, which
will be greater than the capacity of
any other furnace in the world.
Work is being carried on with a
view to these furnaces being in
operation in the coming year, and we
are confident that we will then be able
to meet the fulll demand for glass
containers.
(ii) Singapore;
We commenced production in
August, our Managing Director hav-
ing spent some weeks there organising
the business, and he reports having
experienced many of the difficulties
which are associated with the pioneer-
ing of such an important undertaking,
but expresses every confidence for
the future of the project.
Our Chief Technical Superintendent,
Mr. H. J. Quinn, and other members
of our Australian staff are in Singa-
pore training local personnel, and
they will remain until everything is
operating smoothly and production
reaches the required standard.
(ill) Tasmania:
It has been decided to erect the
factory mentioned last year, and our
Managing Director is now visiting
I Tasmania to launch the undertaking.
(b) WINDOW GLASS
There is still a great demand for
window glass, notwithstanding that,
in addition to our works operating
at capacity, shipments were brought
from overseas, incidentally, at higher
prices than the local product. How-
ever, arrangements are in hand to
enable the demand to be fully met.
OTHER INDUSTRIES
Our activities are now very wide-
spread, and I will merely refer to
them in a general way.
Plastics of all kinds.
Metal stamping and spinning.
Fibre and corrugated strawboard
boxes and cartons.
Steel fabrication.
Drawn bright steel.
Axes, picks and forged tools.
Timber cases.
Corkboard.
These all have had their share of
difficulties, but every endeavor has
been made to keep the plants in
these industries operating as efficiently
as possible.
EMPLOYEES AND WAGES
In the period under review the
average number of employees totalled
6,927, and wages paid £2,628,490 —
an average of £379 per head.
NEW INDUSTRIES
(a) CROCKERY
You were informed last year that
we contemplated the manufacture of
crockery. Since then our Managing
Director has been abroad to deal with
this project, and whilst in the U.S.A.
arranged for two of the Company’s
technical representatives to visit over-
seas to complete the requirements of
the industry. Certain machinery has
arrived in Australia, but it is difficult
to indicate when we shall commence
production. However, the work
is being hastened as much as
possible.
(b) TILiES
The Company has obtained the
Australian rights to an American pro-
cess for manufacturing glazed wall
tiles. Installation of plant is well in
hand, and production will be com-
menced very shortly.
CONCLUSION
The continued loyalty and team-
work of our employees earns our
deep appreciation and we convey
thanks to the Management, Staff and
all employees for the part they have
played in bringing to conclusion a,
successful year in spite of recurring
problems and. difficulties.

SUNDRY SHOWS
WIRTH'S.
Back on its native heath,
Olympia, Melbourne, which is
the big top by poetic licence, the
Greatest Show on Earth is up to
standard. After all, in its 67th
year it is almost becoming an
institution. It has successfully
weathered the storms of modern
entertainment, from the silents
and talkies to radio broadcast-
ing and other etiolated plea-
sures, and it will no doubt sur-
vive television. \
About that time Mr. Phil
Wirth will probably introduce a
new act in the shape of a school
of educated man-eating sharks
who will chase Madame Kovar’s
shapely legs through hoops and
perform as graceful manoeuvres
as the man-eating lions which,
in the present programme, walk
tightropes and mix with two
Great Danes without showing
any excessive inclination to have
a cut of the dogs or Madame
Kovar. If somebody could pro-
vide him with a dinosaurus Mr.
Wirth would certainly train that.
The elephants are as vast and
as imperturbable as ever, and one
enormous beast which doesn’t
seem to have been affected by
the bread strike walks a plank
with every symptom of enjoy-
ment. Two'trapeze-manipulators
carry the art to new heights.
The Great Millette places his
head on a whizzing ball attached
to a whizzing trapeze and
gyrates upside down at a furious
rate with no net beneath him
and no holds —an amazing feat
of balance. The senior mem-
ber of the Flying Wayne troupe,
a big, blond, cheerful giant,
hangs head downwards, catches
both his partners and hurls them
back on to their trapeze —all
perfectly done within a split-
second. He is shortly exchang-
ing this exciting occupation for
the calm of academic cloisters,
where he will study for his
M.A. and become a teacher.
The Kia-ora troupe claim
to perform unbelievable feats of
whirlwind acrobatics and fully
substantiate their claim.
"Manon."
Massenet’s “Manon” has
taken its place in the opera pro-
cession at Melbourne His
Majesty’s. Puccini’s was the
selection for the 1928 season, but
the difference is slight, if any.
The unconscionably unscrupu-
lous brother of Puccini, who
acts as go-between for his sister
in her several amours, becomes
her cousin in tl\e Massenet opus,
possibly out of deference to the
French censors. Otherwise the
drama of wholesale desertion is
the same.
Manon, en route to enter a
convent, deserts her religion for
a Minister of Finance, and five
minutes later deserts that elderly
roue for the handsome young
Chevalier des Grieux. They
escape in the Minister’s carriage
to Paris, where she discovers he
is an impecunious gambler, pro-
vided by opera convention and
J.C.W. with apartments to which
few millionaires could attain.
She deserts him for another boy
friend with a noble title, then
leaves him when she hears the
gambler has solaced himself with
a monkish habit. She seduces
him from the monkhood back
to the gaming-tables, where her
love is such an inspiration that
he makes a fortune.
Humanly speaking, most
operas are pretty awful, but this
is probably the first in which a
rake, spendthrift and gambler is
musically the hero, and in which
the musical heroine who gets all
the loveliest lyrics is a liar, a
courtesan and a thief. Massenet
leaves out the thieving, thus,
making her sentence of deporta-
tion as an abandoned woman
somewhat out of conformity
with French law.
The final apotheosis in Puc-
cini’s opera is a tedious scene in
the Louisiana prairie. Massenet
mercifully cuts Abb6 Prevost’s
novel short and finishes Manon
off in her lover’s arms on a coast-
road near Havre to strains of
ravishing music while the sky
turns sympathetically from pink
to purple,
Rodolfo Moraro, despite his
»
acting, ran away with the
honors, and the perfection of his
tone in the lovely air with harp
accompaniment in Act II held
up the traffic for at least five
minutes. Mercedes Fortunati
was ill-cast as Manon. Her
flightiness was as synthetic as her
passion, but there was charm in
her singing. Leo Piccioli gave
his usual gay performance as
her scoundrel cousin.
Vaughan Williams.
The first performance in Aus-
tralia of Vaughan Williams’s
Sixth Symphony was the high-
light of the ninth subscription
concert of the Symphony
Orchestra at Melbourne Town
Hall. The thundering bang-
bang-bang of the drums and
trumpets which punctuates the
complex argument of the strings
and woodwind in the first and
second movements might have
been Mars busy at his anvil
while the committees are dis-
cussing ways and means. The
calm epilogue which emerges
from the clamor might be a
satiric comment by the artist on
political institutions. Whatever
they represent, the complete
work is an amazingly vigorous
one for the 75-year-old com-
poser.
The symphony was followed
by the Clarinet Concerto in A
major of Mozart. In Mozart’s
day the clarinet was as despised
an instrument as the guitar is in
these times. Mozart, three
months from his deathbed,
showed what could be done with
it, and Thomas White, the Mel-
bourne clarinetist, gave it his
usual reverential treatment.
“West Wind,” set to the ode
by Shelley, and a choral sym-
phonic hymn, “The Silent
Land,” by Welsh composer
Cyril Jenkins, concluded the
proceedings. The Melbourne
Philharmonics gave a lovely
rendering of the closing passage,
“If Winter Comes,” in the first
work and got an ovation. Some
of it might have given to
the composer, who happened to
be sitting in the hall listening.
* * * *
N. S. Wales Chief Secretary
Baddeley lifted the ban on the
Independent Theatre’s perform-
ance of Sumner Locke-Elliott’s
“Rusty Bugles” after the pro-
ducer, Doris Fitton, had deleted
most of the swearing. The puri-
fied version is still a good de-
piction of a tentful of men bored
with Army life in the N.T., but,
with the censoring, a good deal
of the vitality, truth and humor
has gone. Ironically, the broad
good humor of Shakspeare, Ben
Jonson, Wycherley and Con-
greve has been staged in Sydney
without Mr. Baddeley’s interfer-
ence. Still, he probably thought
they were greyhounds,

“F.S.”: The Felton Bequest
trustees have let themselves go
to the tune of 600 guineas at
the exhibition at George’s Gal-
lery, Melbourne, of Sir Walter
Russell, C.V.0., R.A. They
must have been overawed by
prestige or something, as there
is nothing in the three pictures
purchased to explain it. One is
a portrait of a girl which hun-
dreds of R.As. could have
painted, the other two are oil
landscapes. Russell belongs to
the English school of watercolor-
painters who for generations
have been giving out attenuated
echoes of great men like Con-
stable and Turner, His oils
contain no more observation
than his watercolors..
Current Films.
Open City (Sydney Variety): An
uncommonly fine Italian film on the
resistance movement in Italy. Directed
with vast skill by Roberto Rosselini
and acted with similar excellence by
Anna Magnani, Marcello Pagliero and
a string of other remarkably compe-
tent players.
The Glory of Sport (Sydney
Palace): The Olympic Games in tech-
nicolor. One of those documentaries
which English studios do very well
when they set their mind to it — e.g.,
“London’s Victory March” and “The
Royal Wedding Gifts.”
Sitting Pretty (Sydney Mayfair):
Highly amusing comedy with Clifton
Webb as the perfect baby-sitter and
Robert Young and Maureen O’Hara
as the slightly-bewildered parents.
It’s been running for months.
Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream
House (Sydney Regent): Most
aspects of present-day homebuildmg
whipped into a bright comedy, with
Cary Grant and Myrna Loy as the
homeseekers and Melvyn Douglas as
the architect.
Life with Father (Sydney Cen-
tury): William Powell and Irene
Dunne making a fair fist of Clarence
Day’s domestic caricatures.
The Shop at Sly Corner (Sydney
Esquire): Nicely turned English piece,
with Oscar Homolka as an antique
dealer hovering protectively about his
violinist daughter. A seamy bit of
work in the form of a blackmailer
has to be disposed of in the young
lady’s interests.
The Gay Mrs. Trexel (Sydney
Liberty): Filmed version of “Susan
and God” released at last after being
kept on the ice by the censor for some
years. With Joan Crawford and
Frederic March. Amusing.
T-Men (Sydney Victory): Semi-
documentary stuff made into a good
thriller about counterfeiters and the
methods of nabbing them. Denis
O’Keefe is the sleuth.
My Brother Jonathan (Sydney
Embassy); Fairly sincere version of
Francis Brett Young’s novel about
a doctor carrying a banner for the
poor. Michael Denison does well
enough.
The Fabulous Texan (Sydney
Empire): - William Elliott, John
Carroll, Catherine Macleod and a
revolution in Texas.
No Orchids for Miss Blandish
(Sydney State): A much-diluted ver-
sion of the James Hadley Chase
story. Most of the English cast make
a ludicrous job of trying to act and
speak like Chicago mobsters. Tough,
but dull.
Beyond Glory (Sydney Prince
Edward): Alan Ladd as a West Point
officer with a psychological hangover
from the, war.
A Date with Judy (Sydney St.
James): Adolescent nonsense mainly
about adolescents.
Coroner Creek (Sydney Lyceum):
Randolph Scott stiff out West.

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Spring racing—and that is racing at
its best —has been dogged this year by
most un-springlike weather. As
always, there was grand racing at
Flemington on Derby Day, but con-
tinuous rain took away a lot of the
pleasure; so, for that matter, did some
of the results. However, visitors from
other States had no complaint; visit-
ing horses, representing S.A., Tas.,
N. and N.Z., won five of the six
races, took a fair cut of the minor
money, and altogether bagged £10,150
of the £13,500 prizemoney.
There was exceptional interest in
the Derby, with an anticipated struggle
between Carbon Copy and Vagabond.
They struggled all right—for third
place. The Derby went to the South
Australian rep. Comic Court, with
Sydneysider (though New Zealand
bred) Foxzami second and Carbon
Copy third.
Comic Court did not seem to settle
down during his recent visit to Syd-
ney, but, back in Melbourne, had im-
proved rapidly and was perfectly
suited by Saturday’s conditions. The
heavy going and consequent slow pace
enabled him to be well up with the
leaders all the way; at the finish he
left them standing.
The Derby-winner is a brown colt
by Powerscourt (son of The Night
Patrol) out of Witty Maid, is owned in
partnership by R. A., J. D. and A. J.
Lee (jun.), was prepared by trainer
J. M. Cummings and was ridden by
O. Phillips.
Starting at 25 to 1, Comic Court
provided a great result for the books.
Earlier his two-year-old brother St.
Comedy had done bookmakers
nearly as good a turn by not winning
the Maribyrnong Plate. St. Comedy
started even-money favorite and ran
unplaced. The Tasmanian-owned
Adela (W. Cook) gamely defeated Gilt
Archer and the A.J.C. Breeders’ Plate-
winner High Jip. By Midstream-
Suffragette and named after the suffra-
gette leader Adela Pankhurst, Adela
was the only filly to start irt the Mari-
byrnong, and is a full sister to Moon-
beam, who won the race in 1946.
One punter who may in future
think twice before entrusting a for-
tune to the caprices of an inexper-
ienced two-year-old is the gentleman-
reported to have taken the fantast c
wager of an even £7OOO about Sf.
Comedy in the Maribyrnong.
Wherever he may have finished in
the Melbourne Cup, for which they’re
lining up as this page goes to the
printer, Howe established himself as
a really fine horse by the sterling
manner of his winning the Hotham
Handicap. With the track .by that time
a quagmire, Howe faced the job or
carrying 9.12 over 13 furlongs and
conceding other runners from 171 b.
up to 441 b. Despite that, punters
chose the New Zealander for a get-
square” bet after a bad day \ lie
started favorite at twos.
Ridden patiently again by Badger,
and making one think more than ever
that the horse would have been more
wisely ridden in that fashion in the
Caulfield Cup, Howe was well back
early in the race. Between the six-
furlongs’ mark and the turn he gradu-
ally improved his position, and then,
-gaining a run on the rails, came
through as though carrying something
more like 7.12. With second top-
weight of 8.9 little Fresh Boy was
a game second but not in the hunt
with the big fellow.
Sydney fillies .filled the places in
the Wakeful Stakes; Grey Nurse,
showing a sudden return to form,
started at 25 to 1 to beat Wattle
and Sheba. Grey Nurse, who was
ridden by S. Ralph, is a grey Nizami
filly owned by F. W. Hughes, who last
year won the Wakeful and, subse-
quently, the Oaks with another grey
daughter of Nizami in Nizam’s Ring.
It was Sydney again in the 10-fur-
longs L. K. S. Mackinnon Stakes
with the Midstream colt Snowstream
first and Karachi third; old Valcurl
took second money. The solitary
local horse to win on the day was
the much-improved Beau John (N.
Powell) downing Filipino (who doesn’t
seem to have much heart) and Sol-
vive in the Cantala Stakes.
Quantity of horseflesh rather than
quality was the keynote of racing at
Canterbury on Saturday, where the
S.T.C. ran a card of nine races;
nevertheless fine weather, some close
finishes and a string of well-backed
winners made for a pleasant after-
noon’s. entertainment.
The three-year-old Nuffield colt
Cadet won the Flying, in which Rip-
tide finished a disappointing third be-
hind Star Gold after having started
odds-on favorite. Cadet, and also
Merry John, who,won the Welter,
were ridden by young Ray Selkrig,
rapidly proving himself outstanding
among the apprentices. Selkrig went
very close to landing a treble, his
mount, Granite, being beaten but a
half-head by Gay Wallah (A. Mulley)
in the October Handicap (9f.).
In other events at Canterbury the
two-year-olds Vicereine (A. Richard-
son) and Field Boy (A. Mulley) beat
fields of maiden fillies and colts,
respectively, at set weights; Phil Tress
(F. Hickey) and Agenda (F. Williams)
won divisions of the Ashbury Mixed
(6f.) and, over 11 furlongs, Hurry Up
(V. Faggotter) took the Campsie
Mixed. Three-year-olds San Mateo
(A. Hazelton), Tartan Girl and
Cabaret filled the places in that order
in the Three- and Four-year-old Han-
dicap for fillies and mares.

The V.R.C. committee last week
concluded its hearing of appeals in
connection with the Dick Turpin and
Vagabond cases. The horse Dick
Turpin, owner S. Lyons, trainer W.
Duncan and stable foreman J. Hayes
had originally been “warned off” by
the stewards after the horse was found
to have been doped when it won a
race at Flemington on August 21.
After a long and painstaking hearing
the committee found that the horse'
had indeed been doped but that there
was no evidence to indicate who had
administered the drug or caused it to
be administered, and the appeals of
all parties were upheld. In the Vaga-
bond case the committee upheld the
appeals of owner F. Spurway and
trainer Dan Lewis, but rejected jockey
D. Munro’s appeal against two years’
disqualification for alleged improper
practice.
The above and other recent cases
have aroused the usual outcry from
a section of the daily press against
what they choose to term “Star-
chamber methods,” and the usual
“demands” for open hearing of in-
quiries. One wonders if any of the
parties involved in the above-men-
tioned cases would subscribe to those
views.
* * * *
Since transport of horses by plane
is becoming popular here it might be
worth while to record the opinions of
an American expert. N. Y. “Herald-
Tribune” turf writer Joe E. Palmer,
after citing a dozen or so cases in
point, passes one comment on aerial
transport: “The conclusion here is
that the last horse to fly successfully
was named Pegasus.”
* * * *
Unfortunately it seems that, follow-
ing some dickering about expenses
and rules of amateurism, the star
turn of the Olympic Games, Mrs.
Blankers-Koen, may not visit these
parts after all. She’d have been a
great attraction. Her Olympic wins
were in the 80-metres hurdles, 100-
and 200-metres sprints and as a
member of the Dutch relay team, but
she also holds the world records for
the women’s high jump (5.7|) and
long jump (20.6); not bad for a
mother of two children.

“Long-leg”: The Australian
cricketers have arrived home. Their
undefeated progress through England
was a bright effort, though it didn’t
knock much dust off musty records.
“Mick an me Won a Wad on the other bloke, Tiger. Get
dressed and We'll celebrate.”
In all matches seven batsmen topped
the thousand runs, equalling 1926,
1934 and 1938, but it’s one behind

Australian cricket, in the coming
season, will enjoy a much-needed
spell from touring or being toured;
Sheffield Shield matches wdl be the
chief attraction, opening with N.S.W.
v. Q’land at Brisbane on Nov. 26.
’Tween whiles, testimonials to Brad-
man (Melbourne on Dec. 3-7) and
Oldfield-Kippax (Sydney on Feb. 25-
March 1) should rake in the chips
in good causes. With most of the
tourists back in their respective State
teams, Westralia may find the Shield
harder to hold than it was to win.
* * * *
The Rugby League tourists con-
tinue to have mixed luck and their
share of strife over t’other side.
Financially, however, the tour is
breaking all records; expenses have
already been covered, and the gates
from coming matches will be pure
profit. In the past couple of weeks
the Kangaroos have beaten Barrow
(11-5) and Leeds (15-2); they’ve been
licked by Hull-Kingston Rovers
(17-12), Wigan (16-11) and by War-
rington (16-7). In 16 matches so far
they have won nine and lost seven.

Supreme among the featherweights
for many years now, Willie Pep lost
his title at Madison Square Garden
(N.Y.) last week, being knocked in
the fourth round by the colored pug
Sandy Saddler. It was the first time
Pep has been knocked out, and only
his second loss in well over 100 bouts.

When it comes to the little men
of boxing every pound difference in
weights counts, and half-a-stone dif-
ference between flyweights is far too
great. So it was not surprising that
Taffy Hancock, scaling 8.2 f, should
have rather easily beaten N.S.W. fly-
weight champ, Jimmy Hogg (7.9|)
at Leichhardt. Game as they come,
Hogg didn’t let his disadvantage of
weight and reach beat him psychologi-
cally, but kept plugging away and
won two rounds by sheer superior
boxing; Hancock won the remainder.

The New Factors
Trading banks and other busi-
nesses learnt their lesson from
the crash of the ’nineties, and
fortified themselves accord-
ingly after their recovery. No
trading bank in Australia failed
during the financial crisis that
occurred 40 years later.
Following the 1914-18 war,
Governments became greater in-
fluences in the world of finance
and economics. They borrowed
more, taxed more, spent more,
had more employees on their
payrolls and became a factor in
banking affairs, usually having
banks of their own, sometimes
exercising the functions of
central bankers. In Australia the
issue of currency notes and con-
trol of the gold reserve became
the function of a central bank.
Results of the 1914-18 war
were the impoverishment of
Europe, the inflation in cur-
rency and costs, the sudden
ascendancy of the United States
as an almost self-contained in-
dustrial nation, growth of in-
ternal and international in-
debtedness of most of the bel-
ligerents, the flow of gold to the
U.S.A. and the revolutionary
effect on older industrial coun-
tries of the development of the
petroleum and hydroelectric age
in the Western Hemisphere.
The United States became by
far the most wealthy and in-
dustrially powerful nation op
earth.
International trade became
difficult because of the slow re-
covery of the production-rate in
many European countries.
United States mass-production
methods overwhelmed the
world’s markets in competition
with other countries, and tariff
policy throughout the world be-
came chaotic. The United States
in particular was not fully alive
to the world’s need for two-way
trade.
The world in 1928 became a
jumble of conflicting costs and
prices, of buyers and sellers, of
debtors and creditors, of gold
and paper money, of Capital
and Labor, of government and
private enterprise. There de-
veloped a disregard for, or un-
certainty about, the market-
ability of production. Industry
became impatient about the con-
ditions demanded by any well-
conducted financial system.
There was a huge boom in the
United States, which forced up
prices in other countries. Mam>
countries buying from tne
United States and Britain found
their funds becoming exhausted.
Credit contracted in the United
States, the stockmarkets crashed
and the boom of the 1920’s
ended in calamity.
During the next 10 years most
countries of the world became
engrossed in the problem of
credit-control and employment-
control. It was realised that,
provided Labor did its part
honestly and conscientiously,
there was an obligation upon
Governments, industry and eco-
nomic authorities to regulate
credit and production in order
to maintain a maximum spread
of employment and to improve
the general standard of living.
Purely mathematical systems of
credit-control were being re-
placed by methods embracing
human factors in industry and
trade, the less reliable and un-
inspiring human factors being
given due weight. A great deal
was learnt about credit-control
and unemployment-control in
the decade to 1940, and high
hopes were held that the end of
the last war would find Australia
possessed of enlightened eco-
nomic techniques that would
enable it to overcome quickly
the problem caused by war-
time disruption of industry and
costs- and credit-inflation.
But the problem has been
complicated immensely by the
intrusion of “Labor” politics
and the attendant Communism.
The very delicate financial
mechanism of credit-control has
been abused to provide “full
employment” regardless of pro-
duction by those “employed.”
The normal financial controls
enforced to curb inflation and
“booms” in misdirected employ-
ment are no longer operative.
Too many ineffective and restric-
tive controls ape operative. In-
stead of being directed towards
the maintenance of a balanced
state of production and con-
sumption in a community
“I’m the new boy. Say when!”
subject to democratic social
and industrial discipline, Can-
berra credit-control (coupled
with budgetary policy) aims
at producing a continuing
boom in “employment” regard-
less of production, inflation or
industrial indiscipline, and the
restriction of initiative in private
banks and private industry.
The Communists exercise a very
strong pressure, through the
trade-unions and the “Labor”
Government, with the object of
creating price-inflation and pro-
duction-breakdown.
It can be seen that we face
the next depression in circum-
stances greatly altered from
those in which we have met
other crises. We are chronically
short of production from labor
under the 40-hour week and
various “dargs,” the production
incentive has been restricted
through a variety of causes, and
the means by which unemploy-
ment might have been mini-
mised in an economy in which
production initiative remained
intact have been misused and
discredited by Socialists and
Communists. v
World-trade problems are
nearly always a factor in the be-
ginning of a depression. But in
Australia the political abuse of
finance, resulting in the over-
creation of paper money and (he
underproduction of goods and
services, has brought about a
state of affairs in which our
troubles are being created right
here at home.
“Mainspring”
Even allowing for the exuber-
ance natural to. a “director of
customer - research” in the
General Motors Corp. (U.S.A.),
this excerpt from a talk to the
Society of American Engineers
by Henry G. Weaver, based on
his book Mainspring, has a de-
cided inspirational quality in
these Socialist- and Communist-
ridden times:
The greatest of all our inventions
is not even recorded in the patent-
office records—in fact, it’s not usually
thought of as an invention.
No, it’s not mass production. It’s
far more important than mass produc-
tion. It’s the thing that has made
mass production possible.
This greatest of all inventions, and
distinctly American, was the invention
of an entirely new form of political
structure which represented a com-
plete reversal of all the old-world
precedents and which was based on a
principle that is just as fundamental
—just as positive, just as open and
shut, just as inexorable—as any basic
law of physics.
It is the principle that each in-
dividual is in control of his own
life-energy and that human in-
itiative and creative ability spring
from within and simply cannot be
forced from without.
Thus, for the first time in history,
the Christian principles of self-faith,
self-reliance, self-improvement and
individual responsibility were adopted
as the foundation for a political
structure. If you have any doubts on
that point, try to rewrite the Declara-
tion of Independence without refer-
ence to the Christian axioms. It can’t
be done.
So that, in the last analysis, is
the reason why America is the Land
of Opportunity and the Land of Pro-
gress.
That’s why we’ve gone further than
any other people in spreading the
benefits of inventive genius.
That’s why the people of the Unitec
States, who represent only 6 p.c. o:;
the world’s population, own:
80 p.c. of the world’s automobiles
54 p.c. of the telephones,
48 p.c. of the radio sets, and
46 p.c. of the electric power capa-
city.
And the United States, with less
than 6 p.c. of the world’s population,
has 92 p.c. of all the modern bath-
tubs—that is, bathtubs with running
water.
Before the war New Yorkers con-
sumed 140 gallons of water per day
per person. Parisians used 47. Lon-
doners only 43. (No figures on
Moscow.) And before the war Ameri-
cans consumed:
75 p.c. of the world’s silk,
60 p.c. of the world’s rubber,
50 p.c. of the world’s coffee, and
40 p.c. of the world’s salt.
Offhand, the last item sounds a bit
trivial. I was tempted to omit it,
but some of my economist friends tell
me that the use of ordinary salt is
one of the best indices of a nation’s
production and general standard of
living.
Taking that statement at its
face-value leads to the startling
conclusion that the people of the
United States are exactly nine
times better off than the average
people in the rest of the world!
It is interesting to note that this
ratio was recently confirmed by no
less a person than Gromyko and his
fellow-comrades at the United Nations
when they contended that the United
States, with 6 p.c. of the world’s
population, should pay 50 p.c. of
the expense for running the United
Nations’ set-up.
As you may remember, Senator
Vandenburg called their hand. He
thanked them for the compliment
and suggested that if we, by their
own admission, were so much better
off than other nations, then the first
order of business should be the adop-
tion by all the member nations* of
the system which has put the United
States in such an enviable position.
That, of course, was vetoed!
And Mr. Winston Churchill was
talking much to the same point when
he recently told the British Labor
party that they had broken the main-
spring of individual initiative and that
disaster could only be avoided by re-
placing and preserving the mainspring.

NESTOR OF THE N’s
THE LIFE AND END OF A FLEET DESTROYER
By "MACNELL"
The actions of our old V
and W destroyers of the
Scrap-Iron Flotilla during the
war are well known to Aus-
tralians ; not so many knew that
the R.A.N. manned, in addition,
a flotilla of five N-class boats.
Fewer still could name them.
Yet these long, powerful craft,
young cruisers in comparison
with the Vs and Ws, fought
from Murmansk to Madagascar,
and most places in between —
Arctic convoys, the Bismarck
hunt, Malta convoys and the
Crete show, marine-landing on
Madagascar and screening the
British Eastern Battle Fleet,
which, based on Trincomalee,
was for so long a potential and,
with the sea-and-air bombard-
ments of Sabang, an actual
threat to the Japs in the Indian
Ocean.
Norman, Napier, Nizam,
Nepal and Nestor were their
names, 4.7-gunned ships built in
England, loaned to the R.A.N.
and manned almost completely
by Australians. There were three
others of the class, given to the
Polish and Dutch navies. The
Dutchmen, Tjerkhiddes and
Vangalen, were later to meet
Nepal, Nizam and Napier in the
Eastern Fleet.
Of the five, four saw Aus-
tralia, if only for brief periods.
But Nestor, a unit of the R.A.N.,
never saw Australian waters;
and she alone of the flotilla was
sunk, cramming into her fighting
life of 16 months enough action
to bring her headline glpry in-
stead of, as was the case, com-
parative insignificance among
the non-naval public.
It is generally conceded among
naval men that until our Tribal-
class destroys were launched
the Ns were the most graceful
craft afloat —the sort of ships
you turn and watch as they slip
between the lines down-harbor.
Nestor was long and lean.
Most destroyers are. Her keen
bow fell away from the bullring
of the fo’c’sle at an angle of 30
degrees. . The rakish line of her
deck stretched aft for 300 ft. Her
squat bridge, streamlined funnel
and long twin guns enhanced
the impression of speed and
fighting-power.
Where the line of main-deck
portholes ceased her engine-
and boiler-rooms began. Housed
here were the great turbines
that, spinning under jets of
super-heated steam, drove the
huge clover-leaves of bronze
which lifted her 1760 tons
through the sea at 33£ knots.
Teeth and Claws
Above the engine - room
squatted a mounting of five 21 in.
torpedo-tubes, each of which
packed the blast of a cruiser’s
full broadside. Abaft them was
a 4in. a.-a. quickfirer, which,
with oerlikons, was* her a.-a.
defence, though the six 4.7-
inchers could open up on any-
thing not more than halfway up
the sky.
These guns, with her speed
and range, were what made
Nestor a Fleet destroyer. Six
weighty armor-piercing shells
flung at high velocity nearly 10
miles lift a ship from the anti-
submarine class, for which de-
stroyers were originally mainly
designed. She could take on
anything the enemy mounted in
a torpedo attack, and a pack of
her class could fasten their
teeth to some effect in a 6in.
cruiser.
Her upper-deck armament,
guns and torpedoes, were Nes-
tor’s teeth .and claws ; but, even
deadlier perhaps, were the hid-
den Asdic-sets that from her
vitals shafted sonic fingers to
feel and pinpoint anything that
moved below surface. On the
quarter-deck, arranged so that
she could throw them over like
chicken-feed, were depth-charges
in sets of rails and throwers.
This, then, was the ship which
her Australian crew boarded at
Fairfield’s Dockyard, Glasgow,
and commissioned on February
3, 1941. Her first commanding
officer was Commander G. S.
Stewart, R.A.N.
Working Up
Destroyer captains acquire
their experience in a grim school
which requires the power of in-
stantaneous decision, of grab-
bing at the essential lever in an
emergency when every second
counts. Regardless of larger-
ship appointments, they never
quite lose the small-ship disdain
for the mighty capital ship. A
destroyer pack is a sharp wea-
pon, they nearly always fight
against odds, and this attitude
becomes inbred in the minds of
the men who handle them.
Perfect human co-operation
and preparedness for any
emergency are main necessities
in a ship-of-war, and day after
day, working-up with destroyers
of the British Home Fleet off
Scapa Flow, Nestor’s men
trained and sweated in their new
ship, striving always for that
perfection in gunnery which
natural pride and the urge of
self-preservation inexorably de-
manded.
It was as a tightly-disciplined
fighting unit that Nestor sailed
in April, 1941, part of a de-
stroyer screen for a force of
cruisers dispatched northwards
to intercept three German
meteorological ships furnishing
weather reports for the Luft-
waffe. These ships were operat-
ing in a particular area near the
Arctic Circle whose climatic
conditions paralleled the south
of England. The cruisers did the
work, sinking one ship before
the others scuttled. Boarding
one of these, Nestor grabbed
important papers on the met.
work. These were flown im-
mediately from Scapa to Lon-
don with a R.N. intelligence-
officer.
Shortly afterwards Bismarck
was reported at sea. Ships based
on Scapa were split into two
forces to run her down, and
Nestor formed one of the screen
for Repulse, Rodney and the
then-new carrier Victorious. But
long and hard steaming, thrash-
ing along ahead of the battlers,
dangerously reduced her fuel.
She was ordered to Reykjavik,
in Iceland, to top-up. When she
rejoined the screen on May 24
she learned that Hood had
blown up in action.
The heavy units returned to
Scapa, and Nestor was sent to
Londonderry as additional cover
for the hunting force which had
been with Hood. When she
arrived this group had turned
over the Bismarck chase, to the
fleet steaming up from Gibraltar,
and so she missed the kill. Nes-
tor was thie only Australian unit
in the operation.
She Joins Force H
The ship’s next major assign-
ment was a Malta convoy with
Admiral Somerville’s famous
Force H. It was a grim baptise-
ment for a new destroyer, and
her crew were fully blooded
when they’d come out of it.
Captained by Commander A. S,
Rosenthal, the ship slid through
Gibraltar’s boom and up-harbor
to her destroyer “trot.” The
heavies were there —battleship
Nelson, her bridge structure
rearing a cliff of steel above the
fo’c’sle; Rodney and battle-
cruiser Repulse, long and mas-
sive, the latter wearing the Ad-
miral’s flag ; heavy Sin. cruisers
and carrier Ark Royal, her
fighters ranged on deck. Nestor
joined a flotilla of F-class and
Tribal destroyers, all fast,
modern ships. *
She had barely time-to fuel.
Above grey funnels down the
naval line hung a brown haze of
heat. One by one the heavy
merchantmen hove their anchors
home and stood for the open
sea.
In the destroyers’ trot half a
dozen boats nosed their buoys,
eyes on the Leader. A flag at
her yardarm gave a preparatory
jerk, then came down with a
rush. On six fo’c’sles six ham-
mers swung ; slipwires dropped
free and were run dripping in-
board. The red-painted buoys
surged back through the water
with the sudden release of
weight.
It was a cleanly-executed

ABORIGINALIES
“S.H.H.”: Racehorse goannas (B.
29/9/’48)? Had one turn on a show
that more than repaid the mercy* shown
him. We spotted one sunbaking on some
flat rocks about 25 yards from where
the river dropped a sheer 60 feet to a
big rock-pool. My mate pumped a
couple of shots under the go.’s tail. As
the lead whanged on the rock the big
fellow bounced on to his hind scrapers
and, pounding like the limit man in an
old-buffers’ race, reached the cliff and
leapt blindly into space. An unmistak-
able scream drifted up from the depths,
and, doubling to the edge, we were just
in time to see four nicely proportioned
lasses in their birthday suit§ clambering
on the rocks. It didrt’t take one long to
spot us, and, with a banshee yell, she
rejoined the go. in the* water; surfaced,
and pointed hysterically to us above.
The other three beat the go.’s time back
into the pool.
* * * *
“Eureka”; Although Andy’s hut, with
its roof of flattened kero.-tins, was hot,
it was still the coolest place in the district,
as there was not a tree for miles. Andy
and Joe were resting on bunks in the
hut, with the temperature well over a
century. Joe sat up suddenly and listened.
“I can hear rain,” he said. “Big drops.”
“Aw, lie down,” Andy told him. “It’s
only the sun melting the solder on the
roof. You can hear it dropping on the
floor,”
* * * #
“G’ropgr”: Even the best of bushmen
are apt to mislay things in wild country.
Round about the turn of 1900 a s.-w.
Groper, born in the bush and breaking for
new country well away from the family
selection, found his two-horse dray shed-
ding wheel-spokes. Unharnessing the
horses he rode back many miles to the old
village wheelwright, got a new wheel and
started back to his stranded dray. But
though he sought for many a week and
many a month he failed to find it. Track-
ing proved a failure, since torrential rain
had fallen during his return for the new
wheel. Twenty-five years later, riding
with a son in search of stray cattle, he
found the lost dray. The ter-
mites hadn’t left much, but
there it was, in so obvious a
place that he wondered how
he ever missed it. Again, about
the time of the big air races to
Australia, a couple of Dutch-
men, leaving Kalgoorlie with
a single-engined flyer, had to
make a forced landing far out
in the desert. Picking the
rubber-like bed of a dry lake
they got down nicely. Alarm
at their failure to turn up over
east led to the usual air search.
Picked up in due course they
were obliged to leave both
plane and luggage behind.
Luggage and plane are there
still, all air and land search
having failed to find them.
“Mat’s Mate”: The biggest mystery
we ever ran into began at Echuca. We
got out of the train and Mat strolled out
into the little square that opens off Echuca
station while I went to book a trunk in
the cloak-room. When I got out Mat
was in the middle of two coves going
him scone-hot, so I hopped in and did
what I could. Between us we managed
to beat ’em off and they took to their
scrapers. “Whatinell started that!” I
panted. “Dunno,” the big bloke grunted,
feeling his sore spots. “They rushed up
an’ one of ’em yelled out somethin’ about
his missus an’ they tore straight into me.
Gripes, it was willin’. I hope they ain’t
waitin’ on a bloke about the town,” “You
bin seein’ any wimmen?” I asked.
“Mel” be howled, indignant at the bare
suggestion. Well, we looked about
Echuca and we asked about Echuca but
we could neither sight the pair nor find
out anything about them. We speculated
about the episode with diminishing fre-
quency as time passed, and presently
talked of it no more. Nearly two years
later we were at the Forbes picnic races
when a cove stopped us and said to Mat,
“Ain’t you the feller me an’ the brother
pitched inter down in Echuca?” Mat
squared for action. “That’s me,” he
barked. The cove said solemnly, “Well,
we’re sorry. We thought you was some-
one else.” He turned and pushed into
the crowd. We pushed after him, but we
never sighted either of them from that
day to this. Mat reckons he’d give a
quid to know what it was all about.
“Betcha”: It seems that even rabbits
make architectural blunders in the build-
ing of their ground flats. Came on a
single-opening establishment that had
been built without a permit in the home
paddock, and before calling the perpetra-
tors to justice I sent the dogs scouting
around the vicinity for strays. They put
up a big old milky, and after they’d
coursed her into the retreat I set to work.
The burrow consisted of a long, single
shoot, deep enough, but very small in
diameter. X slogged away, but the ground
was hard and dry, and it took some time
before I could prod the quarry with a
stick. When I eventually reached the
milky and hauled her out she was on her
last gasp, while two little half-grown
blokes between her and the end of the
burrow were only just dead—suffocated.
The big rabbit jammed tight in the tiny
opening -behind them had accounted for
all three.

Frank Humphrey: The banana-birds
shrill their alarms like official awakeners,
and from the distance the laugh of the
grey kookaburra comes serenely through
the raucous bark-like calls of his noisy
blue cousin, who now stirs the rest of
the bird world to a chirping, chattering,
Screeching awareness of the dawn’s
approach. From along the river then, as
though at timed intervals, comes the
molten gold of the black butcher-bird
boldly rolling forth his few intricate bars
of syncopation, while his mate measures
their beat with the timed double call of
encouragement, or the raucous off-note
of disgust that invariably closes the per-
formance. Later, when the high sun has
quietened all but the toneless lament of
the doves, a quiet rendition of the black
chap’s strident notes steals into the camp
as though from a distance. It is not true,
however, but a pallid imitation mixed
with a potpourri of other discernible
bird calls. My friend the bower-bird,
furtively grey among the screening leaves
of the mango-tree, is putting on his turn.

“Old-timer”: “It says here,” said
young Bob, looking up from his book,
“that when this bloke Yewlissus an’ his
mob got shut in a cave be a big one-eyed
giant, Yewlissus an’ a couple o’ his blokes
stuck a blazin’ stick in the big bloke’s eye
an’ blinded him. But he’s cunnin’, see,
so he squats down at the cave door, an’
when his sheep go out t’ feed he feels
among ’em t’ make sure none o’ Yew-
lissus’ mob is among ’em. What you
“See what you've gone and done?"
reckon Yewlissus does?’’ Various
theories were offered. “Nuh,” said
young Bob. “He grabs the big rams —
they’re heavy in wool, see —an’ him an’
the rest get under the bellies an’ hang
on an’ the rams go out an’ ol’ One-eye
only feels their backs.” This was re-
ceived with general derision, the main
objections being that no man could get
himself under a sheep in the necessary
position to be carried and that no ram
"I ’m going to christen me kid tomorrow, Alf.
Coming ?”
could carry him if he did so. Bob had
to admit the force of this, from a wide
knowledge of sheep, but he was
“We ain’t talkin’ about sheep like we
muck about with,” he snorted. “In them
days everythin’ was big. They had them
dinnersaws an’ terrordactisses an’ floppin’
elephants bigger ’n the woolshed. These
was big giants of sheep.” The mob
chewed this over. Then Pocketknife
stood up. “I’m orf t’ blanket flat,” he
said, “before them fairy-tales gimme a
nightmare. If the jummies was big
enough for a man t’ ride under ’em like
that a bloke’d ’ve had t’ carry a step-
ladder round t’ read their earmarks.”
That finished it.

“Spinet”: Found a dead smoky-grey
Tasmanian ringtail possum hanging by
its tail from a gum sapling beside the
road to Mt. Wellington. The prehensile
fail-tip was curled round a branch little
thicker than a pencil, while a wind of
nearly gale force blew the rigid body
wildly about without loosening its hold.
I couldn’t tell ho.w the possum died, since
it bore no external marks of violence.
If electrocuted on the light wires, which
were overhung by tall gums, could it
have caught and held the slender branch
in its last fall?
* * * ♦
“Yangona”: Where did “Rawhiti” (B.
13/10/’4B) get his information on kava?
Admittedly his description of the village
maidens masticating the roots of the plant
and spitting the resultant mess into a
near-by trough is correct, but that pro-
cedure is now used only for very special
ceremonial occasions. The village kava
is today powdered by beating
with wooden staves. But as
for kava being a wicked drink
—well, “green” kava will go to
a man’s legs provided he can
get enough of it down, (actually
it has the curious tendency of
making the drinker walk back-
wards), but the kava drunk
throughout the Pacific is prac-
tically all made from dry roots
and only moderately intoxi-
cating. In all island stores one
can now buy powdered kava in
packets. It requires only the
addition of water to make a
nauseous muddy-colored con-
coction that tastes like sheep-
dip. But its medicinal pro-
perties are undoubted, and at
least one Suva doctor main-
tains that a bowl of kava daily is better
than the legendary apple;

“Pongo”: Who told “B. A. Ker” (B.
13/10/’4B) that jarrah is one of our
hardest hardwoods? No builder or
cabinetmaker would say so. Here’s a
rough classification of our hardwoods :
Extremely hard, gidyea ; very hard, iron-
bark ; hard, Murray redgum ; moderately
hard, mountain ash or Tasmanian oak
and jarrah. As a utility timber jarrah
stands alone. It makes excellent railway-
sleepers, telegraph-poles, wharf-piles and
ships and is a splendid cabinet timber.
One of the show-pieces of the Imperial
Institute, London, is a suite of jarrah
furniture. I’m not surprised that “G.
Snatcher” couldn’t drive nails into it—as
“B. A. Ker” truly remarks, a little soap
helps. But best of all is a decent-sized
hammer —a 26-ouncer for preference.
There’s an art in nail-driving, and I’ll bet
those two chatterboxes a coupla shin-
plasters that I can belt a 6in. nail through
a 2in. jarrah plank with one swipe.
*#* • *
“Larrakeah”: Quite correct, “Kerin
Paul,” snakes don’t masticate (B.
20/10/’4B), but there is one huge reptile
still allegedly living in Red Lily swamp,
about 10 miles past
the East Alligator,
N.T., that once had
the peculiar properties
of fossilising its prey.
Far from its normal
habitat years ago
Lupa crawled into the
wurlie of a family of
Worgaits who were on
a long walkabout.
Tired from the day’s
hunting, the sleepers
were swallowed in
rotation without any
alarm. The Joe Blake
made tracks for home,
but, becoming lazy
after his gargantuan
meal, at daybreak he
curled up for a diges-
tive nap. Meanwhile
the rest of the tribe
had discovered the
tragedy and set out
looking for revenge.
Eventually they caught
up with Lupa and
attacked the surprised
crawler with such
good effect that he
began to move in a
wide circle, disgorging
his victims at regular intervals. Unfor-
tunately, immediately on being regurgi-
tated, the bodies turned into blocks of
stone, and in their amazement the tribe
allowed Lupa to escape. Today seven
huge blocks of granite stand within two
miles of Red Lily Lagoon. They are so
symmetrically placed as to be obviously
the work of human hands. But Jacky
won’t have it.
* * * *
“Kali”: Big fish, is it (B. 20/10/’48)?
In 1924 a Greek, fishing from the end
of Darwin wharf, lost his gear so fre-
quently that he decided to rid the sea
of the menace. Fashioning a trace from
a steel clothes-line, he baited it with a
bullock’s heart and awaited develop-
ments. Ten minutes later he was playing
the catch with his half-inch line smoking
on its one turn around the bollard. I’ve
forgotten the measurements of the
monster, but the jetty crane was required
to lift its bulk from the water. Next
morning the minnow was paraded around
Darwin on a half-ton truck. Its huge
cavern of a mouth was staked open, and,
sitting inside on an ordinary kitchen
chair, was a 12-year-old Chinese lad.
“Cornstalk”: “Balander’s” groper (B.
20/10/’4B) is not quite a record. Back
in 1916 or thereabouts two of the
Shannon brothers, of Maclean, Clarence
River (N.S.W.), were fishing from the
wharf when one of them hooked some-
thing which streaked away and broke
the heavy jewline as though it were pack-
thread. Next day he used a heavy shark-
line with a yard of chain, having first
moored his boat at the foot of the steps.
An hour later his yell sent the brother
leaping down the steps as the line raced
out. In a matter of seconds the boat was
unmoored and the oars were out. The
battle that followed tested all their skill,
but towing the heavy boat with the oars
acting as a brake proved too much for the
fish, and after three-quarters of an hour
they pulled to the shore, where curious
helpers dragged the catch on to the bank.
It was a groper which weighed approxi-
mately 6001 b., and hanging from its jaw
was portion of the jewline that had
been broken on the previous day.

“Brian Bureau”: Whiskers Walpole
was cantering his hack Spanker over the
winding, stump-dotted track to the town-
ship when they were engulfed in a dust-
storm that blotted out visibility and
turned high noon into midnight. Relin-
quishing command, Walpole left matters
to his wise old nag, and Spanker, by some
instinctive magic, forged unfalteringly
onward, mile after mile, until he stopped
suddenly and refused to budge. Dis-
mounting and groping his way forward
a few paces, Whiskers was astounded to
find himself in the township bar. After
gulping down two pints in rapid succes-
sion to clear his throat, he heard Bung
exclaim: “’Struth, the sun’s out an’ the
dust’s gom. Wonder where it vanished
to?” “Don’t wonder no more,” snapped
Walpole. “I swallered most o’ it on the
way over, an’ wot I didn’t swaller’s still
stuck in me flamin’ whiskers.”
THE GORGE.
Grey and gaunt the bleak rocks staring,
Bare the massive time-worn stones:
Old the frame dried up and glaring,
White the old and shattered bones.
Hoary roots and veins of mountain,
Sinews torn beneath the sun,
Gashed and slashed the greeny fountain
Where the torrents spumed and spun.
Comes the sigh of soft wind blowing
Through the gap beneath the sky,
Where the little stream is flowing
Placidly before the eye;
Where the furious once came plunging:
Furies thrown in ruthless might,
Waters foaming, leaping, lunging,
Wild and fearful to the sight.
Broken mountain scarred and plundered:
Battlement where eagles nest,
• Where the torrent fumed and thundered,
Sleeps the gorge in mighty rest.
VICTORIA.

“Gem”: “We stayed at one of those
boarding-houses in the city,” said Gerry.
“A real posh sort of place it was, with
bank clerks and fellers with white-collar
jobs and tablecloths arid everything. I
comes down a bit early one morning and
we’re all waiting around for about five
minutes before Dave puts in an appear-
ance in his shirt and trousers, with no
coat. We just gets seated down nicely
when the landlady rocks us with Would
Mr. Ferrier please be so.kind as to put his
coat on before we start?’ Dave stares
down at his plate for a moment and at
the one small boiled egg and slice of
bread. Then he stands up with a bit of a
grin and says, ‘You’re right, missus, I
won’t need my coat off to eat this,’ and
goes upstairs to get it.”

“Taswegian”: Mention by Crosbie
Morrison — in his talk “Wild Life” —of
the introduction into Australia of trout
and salmon ova reminded me of the man
responsible, Frank Buckland. He was a
bora naturalist —at 2 % he could name
correctly the pictures of birds and beasts
in the natural-history books, and at four
he identified for an astonished clergyman
the fossilised vertebrae of an ichthyo-
saurus. All his life, he surrounded him-
self with animals. At Winchester he had
mice, guinea-pigs, slowworms and a
hedgehog. The fate of the hedgehog is
recorded by successive entries in a diary:
“lost hedgehog,” “found hedgehog,” “lost
hedgehog,” “found hedgehog,” until the
final one, “ate hedgehog.” At Oxford he
kept, among many lesser fry, a bear, a
jackal, a monkey arid an eagle. The
eagle stationed itself one morning in the
Chapel doorway and attacked anyone
who tried to enter. The bear proved
troublesome, too, and the Dean of Christ
Church at last told Buckland that either
he or the bear must go. Buckland was
especially interested in tasting outlandish
dishes. At Winchester he was renowned
for his squirrel pies and mice in batter,
while later in life his queer tastes must
have made his friends wary of visiting
him. He ate chops from a panther that
had been dead and buried two days (“not
very good” was his verdict), and when
the giraffe-house at the Surrey Zoological
Gardens was burned down he feasted on
roast giraffe. Two extracts from his
diary: “B. called—cooked a viper for
luncheon.” “Had some elephant-trunk
soup.” An extract from a guest’s diary
wins my sympathy. He wrote: “Don’t
like crocodile for breakfast.”

“Naturala”: One odd thing about the
Dame; as fast as she builds up in one
direction she pulls down in another.
Along sea-beaches she builds up dunes
of sand which, in the course of centuries,
often solidify into rock. At the bottom
of the sea she lays down beds of tiny
shells which solidify into limestone and
which she may in time elevate into dry
land. But, so that the shores shall not
become altogether cumbered with sand
and limestone reefs and formations, she
sends the means of their destruction.
How many beachcombers have noticed
reefs and rocks honeycombed with
myriads of holes, often tenanted by a
species of shellfish glad of such a refuge?
Actually that mollusc made those holes.
Known around Great Britain as a pid-
dock, but found all over the globe other
than in the Polar areas, these bivalves
have a shell of flinty hardness, armed
right around the double lips with a set
of teeth-like rasps. Choosing a rock of
reasonable softness, they soon bore out
“I tell you it's not a goanna !”
a home, enlarging it as they grow. Their
short life ended, the hole remains. Multi-
plied a thousand times, such holes reduce
the weight and toughness of the rock,
rendering it easy prey to the ceaseless
wash of the waves so that it dissolves
back into sand.

“Narrin” : That trapdoor spider with
the camouflaged lid (B. 29/9/’4B) is a
mere amateur. Although I’ve
able to prove it, I suspect the trapdoor
blokes in our sandhill country of wearing
bowyangs and carrying candles in their
hats. Poking around through the mulga
you strike, on a clear patch of red drift,
a neat little heap of what look like oval
pellets of sand. The size of the pellets
varies in different heaps from about an
eighth to nearly three-eighths of an inch
in diameter. Near the heaps is a small,
vertical, silk-lined tunnel, open at the top
and containing a small, light-colored
spider. The “pellets” are actually small
parcels of sand-grains enmeshed in a
network of silk. Very often there is a
regular pad between hole and refuse heap,
bearing witness to the previous night’s
labor. It looks as though the arachnid
quarries out the sand, bags it up neatly,
carts it to the surface, carries it to the
dump and then goes back to repeat the
process all through its shift. Human
ingenuity could hardly work out a neater
way of handling the shifting stuff in a
shaft, and the spider has the advantage
of being able to “timber” as he sinks.
* * * *
“Solitude”: Came on Seventyfiver
squatted before a couple of old kero.-
tins, shakily spooning water from one to
the other and, receiving no reply to my
remarks on quicker means of transferring
it, I left him to it. “A hundred ’n’
seventy-seven, hundred ’n’ seventy-eight,”
I heard as I gathered sticks and boiled
the billy. Then, pouring a mug of tea,
I went out to inquire how much longer
he’d be with the teaspoon. “Hundred
’n’ three—use the fork-’andle —hundred
’n’ four,” he replied. “Hey, you were
more than that before,” I pointed out.
“You’re going backwards.” “I ain’t,” he
growled. “It ain’t my fault if this joint’s
lousy with nuisances. Hundred ’n’ —er —
hundred ’n’—— Aw, cripes, get t’ hell,
can’t y’, Sol?” he roared, pouring all the
water back again. “YTe worse ’n that
thirsty, thievin’ Blue, that can’t even see
water without wantin’ a drink. One, two,
three ” I finished my tea, turned the
nags out, riveted a stirrup-leather, and
was rereading the weekly when the old
bloke at length grunted his way inside,
“Y’d think some o’ them firms ’d work
out a better arrangement, every time a
man wants t’ kill a fly,” he snorted.
“ ’Stead o’ this silly damn business 'o’
mixin’ their stuff three-’undred t’ one.”
* * * •
“S,”: “Narrin’s” toads (B. 13/10/’4B)
have long been employed by medicine-
men of all races, The Indians of the
Orinoco would never kill a toad because
it was the lord of the waters and cus-
todian of rain. Still, the reptilian
divinities were kept under upturned pots
and beaten severely with rods if a drought
occurred. Live toads buried under a
field of grain were believed to act as a
charm against sudden storms.
* * * ♦
“Ned”: The neat-chiselled, quiet
young fellow whom Sandy Jenkins took
on earned his dough and his damper. For
that reason none of us were over-inquisi-
tive about where he came from. But
when he shied away from the offer of
Sandy’s girls to do his washing and mend-
ing, and when he always had an excuse
to avoid a sing-song up at the house, we
began to do some quiet talking. He
started to talk about the spreading crop
of burr in the hill paddock on the morn-
ing that Sandy’s second daughter got
hitched to young Andy Marsh, but old
Sandy told him that he’d have to stretch
his legs under the wedding-breakfast
table even if he had to leg-rope him.
While the feasting went on the young
bloke sparked up and spilled as much
appropriate chaff as anybody. As soon
as the parson had gone Sandy cracked
a flagon of Jolly Roger, and while every-
one was hoping the honeymoon would
be a great event he suddenly reached be-
hind the dining-room door, handed out
the old shot-gun and spoke earnestly with
Joe Simpson, who *vas a good bush gun-
smith. The young bloke went white.
“Crikey,” he said. “I thought the only
place they had these sort of weddings
was on the Nambucca, where I came
from.”
* * * *
“Spinet”: The adrenal glands serve
not only to prepare the animal for fight
or flight (B. 13/10/’4B) but also to make
it terrifying to its enemies by apparently
swelling in size—the hair stands on end,
the eyeballs protrude and the pupils
dilate. That can be seen clearly in the
cat and, to some extent, in its enraged
master. In man, however, a sense of frus-
tration is often felt after violent emotion
because the burst of activity for which
the extra adrenalin has prepared the body
is forcibly suppressed.
* * * *
“Kenwood”: The reference to Pinus
insignis as an insignificant tree (B.
13/10/’4B) is doubly wrong. First, the
correct name of the tree is Pinus radiata.
The name insignis was given by the ex-
plorer Douglas (after whom Douglas fir
is named), and it went into commerce
under that title. The revision of
botanical names revealed an earlier name
for the species, and under the rule of
priority Douglas’s name must go. The
Forestry people use radiata. In botani-
cal parlance insignis means distinguished,
or remarkable, which is rather different
from insignificant. The tree is remark-
able for its dark green instead of the
typical greyness of pines, and for the fact
that it is confined, in its native California,
to a few hills near the sea.
“P.G.”: “Golden Mile” (B. 7/7/’4B) is
correct; a heavy mo on a miner is a
protection against “dusting.” Fifty years
ago stonemasons firmly believed in the
efficiency of face draperies as dust-screens.
In Scotland, Stonemasons’ Union rules
ordered the wearing of not only
moustaches, but beards as well. Pictures
of my Scots ancestors, stonemasons all,
depict them with beards.
* * » ♦
“Plankton”: Now you see him, now
you don’t! For an instant a tiny grey
form the size of your little fingernail
catches your eye. Moving with incredible
speed for so small a creature he seems
like a fleeting shadow as he runs across
the sea-beach, the exact color of the
sand beneath him, and should a passing
breeze accelerate his speed he seems
almost to fly, I don’t know his scientific
monicker, but always think of him as
“the ghost crab.” The natural coloring
of his square carapace has its camouflage
effect perfected by a peppering of dark
spots. His large oval eyes are attached
to strong movable stalks and fit neatly
into grooves on the shell. The tiny mite
is a dinkum digger, too, and can burrow
out of sight very smartly. When un-
disturbed he lies contentedly inside his
burrow, whence he throws out numerous
little balls of sand after extracting such
small nutriment as they contain.
DOROTHY WORDSWORTH;
Christmas, 1799.
Dorothy, that day the daffodils
Danced for you beside the stormy lake
You could not slake
Your futile love at any fount of rhyme
Like William, scribbling lines beneath the trees:
William, who dreamed away the summer-time
In his half-world of apple-bloom and bees.
You were a lone, bewintered swan, with snow
Hemming you in on one small space of bite;
Ho woman sought the crags where you would
go;
No lover sought the soft green vales with you.
Always I think of you at Christmas-time
With Coleridge in London once again .. .
You missed him so —the poet past his prime
Steeping himself in antidotes for pain.
Too soon young Shelley’s aureole was shed,
Too soon Lamb finished with his matchless
Tales;
And Keats, the thin apothecary, fled
From English woods of mourning nightingales.
I think of you the night the fiddlers came
With snowflakes on their shoulders .. . rafters
gledta.
Staid William sits bemused beside the flame.
But you are lost in melody and dream,
Dwelling on timid love what time they played
“The days when we were young.” In earliest
years
No heart can think of breaking in a maid:
Your sight was only dim with happy tears.

Be on the watch for sTgns of listlessness,
poor appetite, warm nose, or a dull,
loose or ragged coat. Digestive disorders
often produce these symptoms and they

THE MAN ON THE LAND
" DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO GRAZCOS."
Queensland Sheep.
“Outback”: On the State
statistician’s figures it will be
some years before Queensland
sheep numbers get back to
former figures. At March 31,
1943, Queensland had 25,650,231
sheep, but at March 31 last the
number was only 16,742,629, a
slight improvement on the
16,084,340 at the same date a
year earlier.
While it is debatable what the
position would have been had
the Blackall-Charleville rail link
been built, there is no doubt that
the figures would be much
higher. Whenever there is a
severe drought in one part of the
State’s pastoral area there is
usually some agistment country
available elsewhere, and a glance
at the map should convince any-
one that a link to connect the
western ends of the central and
western railway systems would
be a wise national investment.
For years this link has been ad-
vocated by graziers’ organisa-
tions and prominent public men,
but parochially - minded poli-
ticians fear that it would take
some trade away from the cities
of Rockhampton and Brisbane,
We have missed the oppor-
tunity of getting this rail link
practically paid for while high
prices rule for our wool. When
prices drop that excuse will be
used for not building it. Premier
Hanlon told a Longreach audi-
ence some months ago that it
would pay the Government
better to buy up all the sheep
likely to die in a drought than
to build the line. Lambs
marked in Queensland during
the years ended March 31 last
numbered 3,730,189 (2,152,802
the previous year), the propor-
tion which the number bore to
the number of ewes mated being
the highest since 1937 (57 per
cent.), which shows that the
sheep are doing their best, any-
way.
Irrigation Improves Pastures.
“Herbert”: Ken Cameron, a
sheepman, of Bullamon Plains,
Thallon (s.-w, Q.), is demonstrat-
ing that self-help pays dividends.
Twenty years ago, when prickly-
pear took millions of acres of
Queensland soil from productive
use Cameron didn’t wait for ex-
periments to establish that the
cactoblastis would eradicate
pear; he liberated insects over
his run and had large tracts on
the way to grasslands before
other landowners lost their scep-
ticism. Cameron is now show-
ing s.-w, Queensland sheepmen
how the carrying-capacity of
land can be trebled and prob-
ably quadrupled.
Bullamon Plains is on the
Moonie River, which runs
pretty strongly after rain. To
defeat rainless periods Cameron
has diverted the bed of the
Moonie for two miles and has
dammed the stream in two places
to hold water for pasture irriga-
tion on a scale seldom seen even
on the well-watered coastal belt.
By building two low-level weirs
he has permanently dammed a
stretch of water 12 miles long.
He is sure that when he has
completed his drought-defeating
work the carrying capacity of a
29,000-acre holding which nor-
mally runs 10,000 sheep will be
quadrupled and that rainless
periods won’t cause him sleep-
less nights.
Already Cameron is irrigating
800 acres by gravitation from a
canal cut three miles from the
river. He plans, as soon as pos-
sible, to irrigate much larger
areas and to sow improved pas-
ture to carry more stock. On
land which he reclaimed from
the prickly-pear he has been run-
ning one sheep to eight acres.
With irrigated, improved pasture
he expects to depasture 30 sheep
on the same area. From his 12
miles long water-storage, by
using canals, he has supple-
mented water supplies in tanks
on different parts of his holding.
Contour Levels.
“T.A.T.”: In B. 8/9/’4B
“H. 8.8.” gave a simple method
of ascertaining contour levels.
Virginia Richards, of Young
(N.S.W.), devised a gadget of the
kind mentioned, and it has been
used extensively and effectively.
Take, say, 30ft. of iin. hose,
two iin. gauge-glasses with same
inside diameter as the hose. Slip
a piece of larger-sized hose
over the end of the iin. —use a
piece about Sin. long and slip
in the gauge-glass. Use a bitu-
minous plastic to seal. Add to
other end of gauge-glass about
18in, of iin. hose by same
method. Treat both ends of long
hose the same way. Take two
pieces of 6ft. by liin. wood and
affix the gauge-glass by insula-
tion-tape thereto at about eye-
level. Put a mark across the
stick so that when the hose is
filled with water the level is
reached when both sticks are
held upright at the one spot.
A refinement which we use is
two bakelite (chemist’s) taps
which fit into the free ends of
the iin. hose. These can be
turned off when level is not in
use, and the gadget can be
thrown down anywhere. Avoid
using gauge-glasses which will
slip into the £in. hose. The
water which is suddenly con-
fined to iin. diameter from the
iin. bounces about too much,
t Made as stated, two men can
mark levels for any purpose
almost as quickly as they can
move.
Strangely enough, the device
described was made to carry out
a project aptly described by
“Sundowner” (B. 15/9/’4B), ex-
cept we decided to keep the
drains level. They work well,
hold all moisture falling and
in our hilly country prevent any
run-off. There is, of course,
something still to be done to
provide as far as possible for
the excess water falling in ab-
normal storms. We plan some
deep drains at intervals, whereas
the contour gutters are being
provided along every row of
trees, saucer-shaped, with the
tree near the outer or downward
edge.
Water for Livestock.
“Myrrhee”; By and large its
functions are to soften coarse
feeds, dissolve nutrients in food-
stuffs, transport digested .food in
solution to different parts of the
body, remove waste and regulate
body temperature. It’s not pos-
sible to answer precisely the
question how much water the
various animals, horses, cattle,
pigs, sheep and fowls drink in a
day, as this *is governed by vari-
able factors. Temperature,
exercise, dryness of feed, level of
production (as with the milking
cow) all play their part in de-
termining water requirements.
Average daily intake of the
various domestic animals is:
Horses, 10 to 15 gallons; bul-
locks and dry cows, seven to
10; milking cows, seven to 10
for maintenance and \\ for every
gallon of milk produced. A dry
sheep in hot weather will drink
about H gallons of water daily,
but a ewe suckling a lamb will
need double this amount, A
pig 2001b.' liveweight drinks 1|
gallons on the average, but a
suckling sow needs up to five
gallons or more in hot weather.
For fowls one gallon for 20 lay-
ing hens provides a safe margin
in all weathers.
Fruits for Preserves.
“Wilco”: Two excellent jam-
making fruits may be planted
from now on along the Queens-
land coast and in the north of
N.S.W., the rosella and the cape
gooseberry. Neither is hard to
grow, *
The cape gooseberry requires
a mild climate and plenty of
water. The better the soil the
bigger the bushes will grow and
the heavier will be the crop. The
fruit is carried during summer
and autumn months. Set the
seedlings four or five feet apart
and tie them to stakes or a net-
ting fence.
The rosella is best sown in
November and transplanted
during December. It will not
stand clay, but will tolerate any
other not-too-shallow soil. The
bushes do not require stakes ;
they grow steadily through the
wet season and bear in the
months from April to July, being
very productive if the fruits are
kept constantly picked. Four
feet of space is ample, but culti-
vate shallowly to keep weeds
down and the soil loose.
Lameness After Shoeing.
“Needle Ned”; If it becomes
apparent soon after shoeing
have the shoe removed immedi-
ately. If the lameness persists
the cause is most likely a nail in
the “quick.” Stand the foot in
a half-bucket of hot water at
least three times a day for a
half-hour or more. The infec-
“Another minute to go!”
tion will probably break out just
above the heel, usually about 10
days after, but in my experience
it has happened within four
days. Continue the hot-water
treatment with the addition of
antiseptic and bandage to keep
clean. Overnight the addition of
antiphlogistine is a good idea.
If the frog begins to lift, pare
the dead part away. Keep the
sole well protected with cotton-
wool and bandage. If possible a
boot should be made from a
piece of sole leather shaped to
the hoof and sewn to a soft
leather top. Later, when the
tenderness has disappeared, an
iron shoe raised at the heels
should be put on over a piece of
firm leather to protect the de-
pleted»frog. Pour a little Stock-
holm-tar under the leather. A
new frog should have grown
within two or three months. My
thoroughbred filly, thus affected
by a prick eight weeks ago, is
almost fit for work.
Requeening Beehives.
“Bumble”; Young, vigorout
queens are the best layers,
few drone eggs in the first sea-
son and are a strong factor with
the colonies resisting the swarm-
ing impulse. High-producing
colonies are the main object, and
that means hives crammed with
large numbers of bees. • Re-
queening seasonally will play a
big part in having the colonies
build up to satisfactory propor-
tions without swarming, also
providing the opportunity to in-
troduce new and better strains
or prevent deterioration by
selection from the best colonies
in the apiary.
Requeening may be done in
autumn or spring, according to
the operator’s fancy. The task is
a bit more difficult at the latter
time, but, considering the ad-
vantages and convincing results
obtained, it is well worth study-
ing how it will fit in with sea-
sonal conditions and normal
working routine. It is possible
to requeen at any time of the
season, when supplies of nectar
and pollen are coming in freely
and drones are available for mat-
ing, Some beekeepers do the
job simply by transferring super-
sedure-cells whenever they come
across them. Admittedly they
get good queens, but it must be
conceded that queens are well
on the downgrade before the
bees set about replacing them.
Requeening with artificially-
raised queens at regular inter-
vals is the better method,
I favor spring requeening be-
cause of the stimulus it gives to
raising large droneless colonies
and the forestalling of swarm-
ing. The drawbacks are doubt-
ful weather conditions, some re-
belliousness and occasionally
attempts to swarm when the in-
troductory method is by queen-
cells., It demands close attention

How the A.M.P. Society
helps the Man on the Land
The first need of a young married Man on
the Land Is to ensure that there will be money with
which his wife can carry on, should anything happen
to him.
At the same time he can arrange that money
will be available to pay off any mortgage in the event
of his death op at a certain date should he live to
that date 5 or that money will be available for stock
purchases or property development.
Every young man should use the A.M.P. to help
him work out his financial problems. Let him ask
the nearest A.M.P. Office or Representative for advice
as how best to do it.

to the apiary for a few weeks,
but once accomplished there
should be no swarming troubles
for the rest of the season. If
mating-hives are available it
would pay to raise and introduce
batches of laying queens, thus
causing only a short interruption
in egg-laying. To get colonies in
strong condition for requeening
early in the season priming with
small, regular feedings of thinned
honey inside the hives is a sound
stimulative measure.
Hints for the Farm.
“Billjim”: A useful home
adornment and one that pro-
vides a unique means of keep-
ing flowers fresh for a maximum
period is the floral plate. Fill a
plate, saucer or bowl with damp
earth, afterwards smoothing it.
With a skewer make a hole in
the earth and insert flower stem.
Place flowers so that a pattern
is formed. If the design is
sprinkled from time to time
these flowers will remain fresh
for a fortnight.
“Prop”; When lopping wilga
for sheep the centre of the tree
should be cut out, leaving the
lowest half-dozen branches un-
touched ; the tree will live, will
fill the centre again and will de-
velop the lower branches into
great leaf-bearing limbs.
“M.”: A fume-proof wall be-
tween the engine compartment
and milk and separator rooms is
a necessity; nothing absorbs
taints quicker than dairy pro-
duce. As an added precaution
see that the engine exhaust is not
placed where prevailing winds
will blow the fumes through ven-
tilators or windows into the
separator-room. If* the roof is
used as a water-catchment keep
the exhaust away from that also.
“Myrr”: The young evergreen
will recover better from the
shock of transplanting if taken
up with a large ball of earth, but
the top needs to be cut back
severely to compensate for loss
of roots. Give the transplant a
watering with liquid manure
made up of 2oz. of sulphate of
ammonia and 4gal. of water
every three weeks until it be-
comes established. Young trees
respond to good mulching in the
hot months.
“K.J.T.”; Which is the best
pullet? The one which begins
laying a full-sized egg or the one
that starts with a small egg
which gradually reaches standard
weight in the course of a few
weeks to a month? Well, the
pullet is young and therefore
not sufficently developed to
stand the strain of a large egg;
full-sized egg-layers often break
down and die. The birds that
start with a small egg usually
become the strongest birds and
heaviest layers. Many of this
type begin with a l|oz. egg and
soon lay an egg up to 2|oz.
regularly,
“Urana”; Young orange-
trees don’t like manure to be
heaped around them. If they
are seedy, dig a trench about Ift.
out from the trunk and put a
couple of pounds of blood-and-
bone in it. Refill with soil, and
before long you will find that
the rootlets have found the fer-
tiliser and the tree will immedi-
ately make new growth.
“Girrawheen”: Milk should
be separated at as near blood-
heat as possible. Cold cream is
more viscous and tends to clog
the disks and interfere with clean
separation.
“Plane Creek”: Lantana is not
only a smotherer of good grass
but is also dangerous to stock
and should not be tolerated in a
grazing paddock. Once cattle
get a taste for it they will eat it
until they die. Brushing isn’t a
good idea unless followed by
burning-off of the stems and
grubbing of the stumps, since the
young shoots are more harmful
than the old growth.
“Big Billy”: According to a
report by Victorian Depart-
ment of Agriculture about 28
per cent., or 9,000,000 bushels,
of the 47 millions of wheat pro-
duced in Victoria last season has
insufficient protein for the
manufacture of i satisfactory
bread flour. This is a higher
percentage than the preceding
season. The department says
that most of the wheat should
be segregated and used for pur-
poses in which low protein is
not a disadvantage and the bal-
ance blended with wheat of a
higher protein content to yield
a satisfactory flour. The survey
howed that the southern Wim-
mera produced most of the
lower-protein-content grain.
TAPEWORM IN DOGS.
In B. 13/10/’4B “C.A.A.” sug-
gested the use of arecoline hydro-
bromide in doses of from one
dram to 2oz. for treatment of
tapeworm in dogs.- Such large
doses would kill the dogs. The
dose for small dogs is not more
than half a grain, and for large
dogs up to two grains—in water.

Most great racehorses are at their
best between 3 and 5 years old
and up to 6 years old for
Sprinters but there are notable
exceptions.
Geldings for example sometimes put
up outstanding performances when
younger or older than the average
*—such as Amounis, who won the
Caulfield Futurity Stakes as a 7 year
old and the Caulfield Cup as an 8
year old and Mollisori, who won
£26,249 in stakes as a 2 and 3 year
old and then faded out.
Ajax, High Caste, Peter Pan, Heroic,
Eurythmic, are four instances of
famous horses who were great as 3
year olds, great as 4 year olds, and
great as 5 year olds.
Unlike racehorses, whisky never
enters its prime until it is over 5
years old. Not until then does it
attain ' fine bouquet and mellow
flavour. Corio /Special is aged for
over five years (more than double
the minimum set by Commonwealth
law).

medical man yourself, and as
long as you were loyal to the
doctor and he to you there was
no risk of an interloper. I will
not vulgarise this relationship
by the suggestion that you put
things in the doctor’s way and
he in yours. Besides, the dentist
was a party to the collaboration,
which proves, if anything can,
that it was purely professional
and high-toned in its nature.
T. Bland was Blandy on the
bowling-green. There he was an
important man and showed real
character, for he believed in
bowls, was grave about its ethics
and worried over the green as
he worried about nothing else.
He was chairman of the green
committee; practically a lifer,
and I used to like to see him in
abstruse discussion with the
caretaker, walking over the
sward before the season com-
menced. The caretaker, a wiry,
voluble little party, would pro-
test, “Well, they ought to give
her more of the big roller, Mr.
Bland, It ain’t for me to do it.
It’s more than one man’s work.
I’m always telling ’em.”
To this feeble excuse (which
was what it really was) T. Bland
would listen diplomatically, seri-
ously and silently as befitted one
who would have the ultimate
responsibility for what was done,
for it is no mere empty honor
to be chairman of a green com-
mittee.
His toughest time was when
Sunday drinking gave rise to a
certain amount of talk. It had
always been the practice to par-
take of a quiet glass and a snack,
maybe a sausage-roll and a sand-
wich, during the course of Sun-
day play. Then the admission
all of a lump of half a dozen
new and fairly young players
upset the balance of the club.
The worst was Young Tim Hop-
juice, noisy, full of bonhomie
and a lover of popularity, whose
audacity was his chief claim to
public regard.
Young Tim and his push took
to planting a keg in the club-
room the night before. They
sang, and it may have been true,
“Another little drink won’t do
us any harm,” but it did do
harm to the club, for it got it
talked about.
Certainly the talk was not un-
congenial to most of us, and, as
was the Paka Puki way, would
have gone on till the cows came
home without anything being
done. But there was the addi-
tional fact that Young Tim got
under the skin of staider mem-
bers, that friction bred faction,
and that there was a danger of
his (Young Tim’s) faction putting
him in as president for the en-
suing year. (Young Tim liked
to be at the head of things.)
Of the stern and effective
measures taken to prevent this
T. Bland could, and did, honestly
claim to be the spearhead. He
had himself elected president and
kegs were barred, and Young
Tim (forty-five), cocky and all
as he was, was told where he
got off. It proved an exhaust-
ing two months to T. Bland, for
altercations took a great deal
out of him. What he did en-
hanced his local standing, but
was wholly attributable to his
pure and high-minded belief in
bowls,
MRS. T. BLAND was that
curiosity of which all
small towns have one —a mar-
rietj-unmarried woman. She
was too spiritual for her hus-
band, but they had fallen into
certain habits and rubbed along
right enough. She had aesthetic
yearnings and also trifled with
spiritualism. California, that
catholic home of peculiar cults,
would have suited her down to
the ground. One year, regard-
less of how T. Bland had to
make a living, she developed a
craze for faith-healing and went
so far as to .bring a semi-profes-
sional faith-healer into the
township. People were down
on her for that; it showed such
a lack of consideration for
Blandy.
Mrs. Bland also had hanker-
ings for drama—not the sort of
thing Mrs. Golightly went in for
so brightly and boldly, but real
plays. She nearly always had a
male newly come to Paka Puki
in tow, and he was, as a rule,
10 years younger than herself
(she was 15 years younger than
T. Bland), and to my way of
thinking there was a hint of
something effeminate about him.
For a time such a young man
was a social companion, and
Mrs. B. took complete charge of
him.
Her craving for the stage got
no further than play-readings,
sometimes in costume and some-
times with action ; such action
as one book of words between
each two readers permitted. Of
course Will Beswick was roped
into these readings. He read the
stage directions, which was all
he was fit for in this line, being
a bit of a stick. Mrs. Golightly
pushed her way in, but proved
annoying. She took the wrong
tone. Once or twice I did old
men. In “The Barretts of Wim-
pole Street” I believe I was
rather good. Such a man to
hold his own on his own hearth.
He was far from being entirely
in the wrong.
T. Bland’s appearances at
these readings were rather
casual. He was not aesthetic,
and had a habit of entering into
whispered conversation with his
neighbor in the audience of a
score or so which could be most
provoking, although it was in-
nocent enough. There was no
malice in T. Bland.
THE plays were curiously of
a kind ; I venture to charac-
terise them as pale. Young
ladies in them were unhappy, it
seemed to me, because the world
was too coarse and crude for
words and because they had
not yet, so exquisite were their
sensibilities, found a male by
whom they were not repelled.
Their habits were, nevertheless,
interesting in some ways. They
drank quite a little, and once
and again came to light with
rather startling physiological
facts. At the time I was reverent
of their aesthetic message, but I
have since come to the conclu-
sion that, fundamentally
spinsterish, Mrs. Bland’s hero-
ines were suffering from ingrow-
ing egos. I may, of course, be
wrong.
One play made all Paka Puki
sit up. The heroine in it was
carrying the baby of a man
whom she would not marry till
she was sure of herself. Mean-
time, at her request, he had gone
to India to let her get her life
into perspective. The baby
played something the same part
as the ghost in “Hamlet” ; he
obtruded into the dialogue,
which was very introspective and
high-minded.
T. Bland, chatty and, as I
have said, immune to the
aesthetic, was more inattentive
than usual. He did not even
notice when Mrs. Golightly
nearly ruined the play by gag-
ging wickedly. When Mrs.
Bland, fragile and big-eyed, said
“I know I have it in me to be
someone’s life - mate: but
Robert’s? That I cannot at the
moment be sure of,” Mrs. Go-
lightly rejoined, with her eyes
on the book, “But that is just
the point, Elspeth. Can any of
us be sure what it is you have
in you?”
Will Beswick, like the good
fellow he was, saved the situa-
tion by reading the stage direc-
tions half a page further on.
This gave Elspeth time to re-
cover poise, and from then on
she read her lines with a vim
and asperity unusual for her
and not altogether in keeping
with her rather pathetic role. %
TIME has aged many of us
since those days. I think
that nowadays Mrs. Bland makes
up a bit more than she used to.
I cannot explain how it was that
she disliked Miss Katts, for they
were both, if I may be allowed
to use the word, soulful, She
was in the doldrums when Trev
Waters came to Ngatipattik to
take over the chemistry business,
but she failed to interest him in
her social and soulful comings
and goings.
T. Bland has retired. His in-
terest in bowls is now an all-day
matter. He never seems put out
by Mrs. B.’s latest crush, or
craze, or credo. Half his time I
don’t think he knows what she
does. When they pass over they
are bound to be on different
astral planes; a fact that, as in
many other cases, may or may
not somewhat alloy their other-
wise perfect bliss.

The Colonel had just got back
from bagging wildebeest in the

“Isn’t she a beaut!” he ex-

“To Whom Honor Is Due.”
Cho Kerr, president of the
Sydney branch of the Mur-
derers’, Garrotters’ and Thugs’
Association, was giving his presi-
dential address at the Annual
General Meeting of the organisa-
tion.
“Gennelmen,” he said, “it
gives me great pleasure to report
that the past year has been a
record [Cheers], an’ I think we
"Which one are you going
to keep , sir?”
can confidently look forward to
an even better one nex’ year.
“The ’eavier type o’ steel-
tipped boot that come on the
market ’as bin found o’ great
benefit to those of our members
’oo' speshalise in this kind o’
persuasion. Our various other
activities ’ave given a great
boost to the bottle- and razor-
makin’ industries.
“It’s one o’ the marks o’
yuman ingratitude that none o’
the manufacturers o’ these com-
modities ’as seen fit to make a
donation to our association.
One of our members durin’ the
year was good-’earted enough
to offer, for a couple o’ quid, to
give one o’ the makers o’ cut-
throat razors an unsolicited tes-
timonial to the way their pro-
duct ’ad stood up to constant
’ackin’ through jugular-veins
over a long period without ’avin’
once been ’oned. They knocked
’im back, the lousy cows, an’
w’en ’e wrote an’ threatened to
chuck their razors up and start
usin’ safeties they ignored ’im.
The cunnin’ sods knew there’s
nothin’ like the good old cut-
throat kind for our work.
“That fear o’ not reachin’
‘full employment’ that y’ ’ear
the politicians naggin’ about in
Canb’r’a don’t worry us. Your
association can boast that its
members are never without em-
ployment—in fact, the industry
in Australia’s biggest city ’as got
to work overtime to keep up
with the demand. As for man-
power shortage, the on’y kind
that could worry us would be a
shortage o’ blokes with wads in
their kicks ’oo mooch around
dark lanes at night—an’ that
ain’t likely,, Sydney bein’ full o’

“Your executive reports that
it was approached durin’ the
year by some Commos, ’oo
reckoned we were their natural
allies, an’ that if we’d become
wot they call one o’ their
auxilyeries they c’d put a lot o’
work in our way, an’ that w’en
the revolootion come some of
us would be appointed Com-
missars. The offer was turned
down, your executive feelin’
such an association would be
degradin’ to our members.
“Your executive regrets to re-
port the untimely passin’ durin’
the year of your treasurer, Joe
Welsher. The day after the final
date set for the collection o’
members’ dues Joe disappeared,
an’ so did our oscar. Two days
later ’is body was found, an’ it
is thought ’e was the unfortunate
victim of an attack by borers —
anyway, ’e was full of ’oles. The
office o’ treasurer is still vacant,
an’ will be filled by election at
the end o’ this meetin’. Candi-
dates can be assured they won’t
be able to rely on more than ’alf
a day’s start.
“At this junkcher I’d like to
pay tribute to the bunch of old
women o’ both sexes ’oo
take such a keen int’rest in
makin’ things so easy for us
these days in prison. Let us re-
member that it is always these

lash just for kickin’ a bloke to
death, rush to our defence. We
oughta be thankful that they
always show more sympathy for
us than the blokes we bump off
or their widders an’ kids.
“The greatest pleasure it gives
me as president to announce is
that, except for the treasurer as
mentioned before, the on’y
members ’oo ’ave wriggled out
durin’ the year died, as the
coroner says, of natural causes.
“ ’Ow diff’rent is that from
the bad ole days! I remember
when I first joined this associa-
tion as a journeyman-garrotter
it was nothin’ for us to lose any-
thing up to ’alf a dozen members
a year through ’avin’ a knot o’
rope clout ’em be’ind the lug
while they was markin’ time in
the air. They was Crool Cows
in them days.
“These days, as you know, its
nothin’ for one of our members
to plug someone, be ’anded a 12-
year stretch, kid crook in clink
an’ he out after a year or so to
go off on an unofficial ’oney-
moon with ’is blonde ‘fairy.’
That’s ’ow things should be.
“An’ ’ere, gennelmen, I’ll arsk
y’ all to be upstandin’ an’ sing
‘For They Are Jolly Good
Fellers’ to the mob that makes
our necks safe. We can boot
blokes to death or slit their
gizzards, ’appy in the knowledge
that we’ll on’y git a few years in
clink, where soon, owin’ to the
good work o’ the reform blokes,
we’ll be ’avin’ caviare for break-
fast an’ free manicure service.

The Long Blow
Many Westralian pastoral concerns
which are classed as private companies
have just passed through seven years of
the most severe drought on record. They
have had one or two good seasons lately,
and, with increased wool prices, had a
remote chance of recovering their
stability. But that was without allowing
for the exactions of the Chifley Govern-
ment.
One station has not paid a dividend
for 20 years after spending about
£2O-25,000. This year, its figures to the
end of June disclose a profit of £17,000,
but it looks as though Chifley will appro-
priate about £14,000 of that. It only
needs another dry year and the concern
will probably be abanddhed by its
holders.
Most, of our pastoral, properties are
held by the original owners, but they
must gradually pass to younger men. It
is impossible, however, for a young man
to buy a property with any prospect of
paying part of the purchase price out of
profits. Savage taxation absorbs almost
all the surplus.
The NT. is practically free from taxa-
tion in order to encourage its develop-
ment,' but the north-west of W.A. —which
is in exactly the same position as the
N.T.—is being bled to death to provide
funds for politicians'
The State Government has recognised
the.parlous position of these pastoral pro-
perties and is making substantial allow-
ances of land rents, but, ironically, the
Commonwealth taxgatherer comes along
and obtains increased revenue from the
State’s efforts to ameliorate the position.
—J. L. B. (W.A.).
Macquarie Buildings
Preservation of , Sydney’s Macquarie
buildings, should be the aim of all Aus-
tralians who attach any importance to
history and tradition —with the materials
and labor available, Macquarie was cer-
tainly responsible for some fine work.
The buildings have not proved so im-
pervious to the ravages of time as is
popularly supposed; but for unremit-
ting repairs and maintenance on which I,
for one, have worked during the last 50
years, they would have long ago crumbled
to dust.
Enthusiastic admirers of Macquarie
buildings have often drawn my attention
to the excellent condition of St. James
church and are inclined to doubt me
when I tell them these facts:
In 1893 the condition of St. James so
alarmed the trustees that they commis-
sioned architect Varney Parkes to re-
model and reconstruct the whole edifice.
The entire roof—every stick of timber,
every slate and all iron—was renewed ;
the steeple was demolished and rebuilt
to a new design; all the external brick-
w’ork was replaced with 9in. brickwork,
the bricks (Sandstock 2|in.) being made at
Liverpool by a Mr. Thomas. All the
stone porches, inside plaster-work, the
enclosing wall and handrail, windows,
doors and interior seating were renewed.
Restorations were carried out by the then
well-known builders J, M. and A. Pringle.
All that actually remain today of
Macquarie’s St. Jqmes are the inner walls
and; basement. Incidentally, church
officials who recently organised a search
for the church foundation-stone may find
it behind Varney Parkes’s new outside
skin. —Pongo (N.S.W.).
Home from Home
The men who work for B.H.P. at
Whyalla are a fortunate crowd, even if
they’re not aware of it. The hours
(mostly day-shift) are from 7.30 a.m. to
4.15 p.m., the lowest pay for laborers
being £7 ss. for a 40-hour week, which
is npt bad. Married men In the majority
have been established in their own homes
by B.H.P:, and single men can live in
special quarters, also provided by their
employers.
The single man has a room to himself,
and he can invite a guest along at night
for a game of cards if he cares to. The
room is 12ft. x 9ft.’ and has a good bed
with white sheets and pillow-slips. There
is suitable illumination, and a reading-
lamp at the head of the bed with an
accessible switch. Furniture is reason-
able and includes a wardrobe, mirror,
writing-desk, chair and table. The win-
dow has a blind and colored curtains.
Mosquito-net is available for summer
months.
Women make the beds and tidy-up the
rooms each morning, while the men are
also waited on by women in the mess-
room, where good wholesome food
(usually three courses with a variety to
choose from) is prepared by a chef.
Toilet facilities and sanitary conditions
are good, and there is a canteen, mail
delivery, a telephone and a laundry
service done for nothing, with certain
restrictions.
For all this the worker is docked 355.
a week from his pay. Yet a number of
men still complain about their living
quarters and wages. Some say the food
is not good enough, others think the
board is too dear, and there are those
who really believe they can get better
money elsewhere.— Silver Bullet (S.A.).
P.M.G.’s Department
Inefficiency in the P.M.G. ? s Depart-
ment (B. 11/3/V8) is hot caused by a
“vastly increased number of temporary
employees and casuals,” whom most
postmasters find as efficient and con-
scientious as the average permanent
officer. It stems, rather, from the amount
of non-departmental business that has
been shoved on to postal staffs in the
"I Won't talk t ’ you if you keep losing your temper!”
Government’s bid to make us the greatest
form-filling nation in the world.
In the old days, when permits were
unheard of, and shortage was a word in
the dictionary, postal clerks managed their
own department’s work efficiently
enough. Now counter officers have at
least five jobs which have no bearing
whatever on their prescribed work.
Petrol rationing is one example. The
time spent on that would provide enough
man-hours to enable postal clerks to
satisfy even the most demanding taxpayer.
The taxation-instalment plan is another
imposition, and there are many others,
some small in themselves, but the sum
total of them means a great deal of un-
paid overtime for all concerned. Under
these conditions it’s no wonder that
efficiency drops. Actually, considering
all the additional work, the P.M.G. men
qre doing a damn’ good job.
When the postal authorities refuse to
handle any business not connected with
postal work, the department will return
to that old standard which made it a
model for all other departments.—
Young Slim (W.A.).
Science and Food
In his admiration for scientists and
their restoration of worn-out soil H. A.
Lindsay (B. 13/10/’4B) seems to forget
the all-important factors of cost, man-
power and rainfall. He is dealing with
theory rather than fact when he says
that “a raw subsoil stripped of all its
topsoil by wind and water can be restored
to full fertility in as little as ten years.”
In a good-rainfall area that could be
done by Carting and .spreading compost
on the denuded area at a rate of several
tons to the acre to form a seedbed for
planting legumes. But the cost would
be out of all proportion to the value of
the land. In an arid area it could not be
done. U.S. authority A. tt Bennett in
his Soil Conservation gives the cost , of
reclamation of only partly-denuded soil
in the Brisighella project near Florence,
Italy, as from 250 to 350 dollars an acre,
or double the value of the land. . Aus-
tralian labor costs would double or treble
that figure.—l. W. R. (Tas ).
Rice
The present method of supplying rice
to New Guinea is a good example of
“control.” Companies, corporations and
large consumers of rice applying to the
Administration for a quota for future
needs have been told that rice is allocated
only to established merchants within the
Territory and one or two agents in
Sydney. The following ponderous state-
ment is from an official letter: “The
supply of rice is regulated by the Rice
Equalisation Committee, an instrument-
ality of the Marketing Division of the
Commonwealth Department. of Com-
merce and Agriculture.”
The consumer must buy from these
“established merchants” at prices above
those at which he could obtain rice from
Australia—southern firms are prepared
to supply the stuff, but cannot do so
without a permit.
It means that the Government,
allegedly opposed to monopolies, is it-
self combining with the larger concerns
in New Guinea and forcing consumers
to pay more.
The Golden Age price for rice is £62
7s. 3d. per ton at Lae, compared with
£2O before the war. The new standing
of this staple item of native food is indi-
cated by the list of prizes at a recent
U.N. Children’s appeal carnival at Lae.
Among the crystal glassware and free
plane trips to the inland was “One Bag
of Rice.”— Lim-Limbu (N.G.).
“The Government Stroke”
Politicians have a peculiar attitude to
the present unfinancial state of N. S.
Wales transport undertakings. Their only
answer to enormous losses is to raise
fares; the other side of the profit-and-
loss account (expenditure) is conveniently
forgotten. The first consideration of
private enterprise is to cut expenses long
before the price of its product or service
is raised. Of course, our transport ser-
vices have a virtual monopoly, so that,
without competition, there is no need to
watch expenses.
During a visit to Sydney I was amused
to watch three men laying a tarred strip
about two feet wide along the edge of
Petersham station. One man laid the
material in a heap, another spread it, and
the third rolled it out. At the rate they
were working they couldn’t have finished
in less than two days. One man could
have done the whole job in a day if he
worked.
There is the crux of the whole prob-
lem. Losses on the railways and tram-
ways should not be blamed on the 40-
hour week and increased wages. That is
purely escapist, and the Premier and his
Minister for Transport must know that
the “Government stroke” is crippling the
service more than anything else. But a
“Labor” Government is not game to
rectify that, so the public must pay extra
fares and higher freights.— Red Earth
(N.S.W.).
Rising Prices
Private enterprise must be careful of
giving Labor too much ammunition for
the next Federal election. Prices, for in-
stance. Since the end of Federal control,
many goods and services not subject to
price-fixing are creeping upwards. Costs
are certainly increasing, but if prices con-
tinue to rise “Labor” will make the most
of it, particularly as the financial pages
of daily newspapers constantly report
higher dividends, increased profits and,
frequently, record returns for public com-
panies.
That sort of news helps to counter
the claim of costs being too high, and
makes people resent having to pay more
for some of the things produced by these
flourishing concerns. Within the next
few months private enterprise would be
doing its cause* a lot of good if it could
start a price-reduction movement and
keep it going. People remember the
claims that freedom from control, plus
competition, would increase production
and keep prices down. That is probably
the main reason why they voted so
strongly against the Government’s refer-
endum proposals.
What private enterprise, and the politi-
cal organisations supporting it and being
supported by it, should remember is that
voters are moved by self-interest more
than anything else, and that, although
their own incomes may be higher, they do
not like paying higher prices to someone
else. “Labor” will capitalise on that. — Sam
Square (N.S.W.).
New Crops
No one can accuse Australian Depart-
ments of Agriculture of acting hastily in
the introduction of improved types of
crop and pasture plants from overseas.
Hybrid com had been giving splendid re-
sults for years in the U.S.A. before Aus-
tralia did anything about it. Little notice
apparently, has been taken of the many
new types of clover being grown in
America; the Ladino variety of white
clover, which appears to be excellent, is
now only being tried here, years after
it became a general constituent of pasture
mixtures in the U.S.A.
Considerable publicity given the Kudzu
vine and the lespedezas forced the ISLS.W
Department to make some guarded state-
ments on those plants, but very little has
since been heard of them from official
sources. ,/
Whenever the subject of perennial
wheat is raised in this country, the expert
greets it with a cynical smile, although
no attempt has been made to breed it
for our conditions. The soybean is
gradually becoming popular, despite
official indifference and even hostility.
If our Departments of Agriculture
were awake they would be trying every
improved plant evolved in any part of
the world, because we have most climate
and soil ranges to be found elsewhere. —

The Root of the Matter
A young Scottish ex-serviceman, who
came to this country with his wife and
two young children some months ago,
took up residence with relatives in a Vic-
torian provincial city. The accommoda-
tion being cramped, and another qhild
expected, he decided to buy a house if
he got the chance. One estate-agent
whom he saw had a house for sale, and,
after offering it to the tenant, who de-
clined to buy, offered it to the Scot, who
accepted, subject to Treasury consent.
While the contract was still in the
Treasurer’s office, the migrant’s wife re-
ceived a visit from an officer of Mr. Cal-
well’s Immigration Department, who had
travelled all the way from Melbourne to
cross-question her about the purchase of
the house. Who told him of the transaction
and on what right he based his inquisition
are not known, but it seems that migrants
who come to this country are on a dif-
ferent footing from native-born Aus-
tralians. — Dutigalla (Vic.).
An A.L.P, press advertisement states
that “Labor” should be returned at the
next Federal election because of “the rise
of 14 per cent, in the real income per
head since 1938-39.” The National Bank
of Australasia is cited as the authority.
Chifley and company can’t justly claim
credit for any such rise. They have had
nothing to do with the bumper prices
for Australian exports—the main cause
of the much higher nominal national in-
come compared with 1939. Further, com-
parison of 1938-39 with 1928-29 would
also show a substantial gain in real in-
come per head, probably a much more
impressive increase than any that has
taken place since.— Economist (N.S.W.).
Why do we have to depend on overseas
countries for olive oil? S.A, has produced
olive oil as good as the best Italian, and
large areas of that State are suitable for
olive growing. There are other suitable
regions in the Murrumbidgee irrigation
area, in parts of Queensland and Vic-
toria —in every State in fact. It might
bo worth helping ex-servicemen to
establish themselves in a comparatively
new industry.—W. P. T. (N.S.W.).
If Chifley and McKenna really want to
do something for national health, they
should dump their “free” - medicine
scheme and subsidise doctors and dentists
in sparsely-settled areas where none are
available now; provide more and
better hospitals, dispensaries and Flying-
Doctor services for country areas; and
extend research on cancer, arthritis,
tuberculosis and the stamping-out of
venereal and other diseases. A pointer
to some of the jobs they can tackle is
given by the Far West Children’s Health
Scheme and the Bush Nursing Associa-
tion in N. S. Wales.— Y. Ham (N.S.W.).
The Taxation Department has just
claimed £l4O from the committee work-
ing on the Ballina War Memorial Fund.
Under the impression that it would re-
ceive the usual taxation concessions
accorded to charitable organisations, the
fund sponsors have been going along with
their job, only to find that, because of
a flaw in constitution, the Depart-
ment could, and would, demand its pound
of flesh. — Bungle (N.S.W-).


in a voice of terrific volume; Dora Min-
archi was acting like an angel and devot-
ing her glorious tones to a bad cause as
a wandering Biscayan gipsy; Ferdinando
li Donni, perhaps a bit too gentlemanly
for a villain, was acting and singing well
as the notorious Count di Luna ; Clabassi
was gyrating very surely in the small
part of a captain, and Rafael Lagares
was giving his lovely voice and his sloppy
acting to Manrico, the young chieftain
whose mysterious birth and equally
mysterious relationship to the Count di
Luna helps to make an incomprehensible
plot more incomprehensible than ever.
Mercifully enough, nobody knew what
it was all about, however, and nobody
would have known if it had been sung
in English or any other language. Be-
ing possessed of the barmiest plot on
record, the story starting long before the
curtain rises, it was a distinct advantage
that Verdi’s most continuously melodious
opera was sung in Italian. Had it been
sung in English confusion would have
been worse confounded and a dazed
audience would have been so busy worry-
ing as to whose baby was thrown into
the flames and who grew up obsessed
with the idea of wreaking vengeance on
the supposed murderer of his supposed
mother, only to be murdered by his own
brother, not to mention the other cumu-
lative horrors, that it would have missed
the high “C” which every up-and-coming
tenor feels obliged, without the com-
poser’s sanction, to put into the aria “Di
quella pira.”
It would also have missed the lovely
Miserere, sung off-stage with telling effect
by Lagares, the enchanting “Amor-
sublime amor,” and the dozens of other
arias and lyrics which the genius of
Verdi poured into the ridiculous extrava-
ganza. Nothing demonstrates the com-
poser’s genius better than the fact that,
once the crazy thing is started with
Captain Ferrando’s long, dull and grue-
some recitatives, nothing can stem the
sparkling tide of music except the final
curtain. Chorus and scenery were good,
and the local Wilma Whitney was excel-
lent in the small part of Inez.
Jacob Lateiner.
If anything were needed to confirm
earlier appraisals of Lateiner it was pro-
vided by his playing of the Brahms
Paganini Variations at his final Sydney
recital. Every facet of each gem in this
finest example of Brahms’s theme-and-
variation art gleamed and glittered under
the pianist’s dazzling technique.
In Beethoven’s Sonata Op. 57 (the
“Appassionata”) Lateiner made of the
Allegro Assai the night piece it truly is.
Strong emotional outbursts, with sonor-
ous masses of tone built up in the re-
cesses of the bass, were culled from the
“I told you not to give them an
encore !”
shadows, only to sink back again. A
crystal-clear tone and serenity marked
the short, slow movement.
"Abstract" Art.
Eric Wilson’s “The Steriliser” and
Ronald Steuart’s “The Two Shells” are
the only two pictures that have any kind
of independent life in the exhibition of
abstract art at David Jones’s Gallery,
Sydney. It is interesting to note that
both paintings have some flavor of realism
—Steuart’s shells are recognisably shells
and Wilson’s steriliser is a kind of blue-
print concept of a piece of mechanism
with a central dramatic point of escap-
ing steam —and that both Wilson and
Steuart have demonstrated that they can
paint in the past.
The other exhibits—the brightly-
colored dots and cubes of Grace Crow-
ley, the green and sombre pyramids of
James Cant, Ralph Balson’s squares and
Gordon Andrews’s grotesque bones—are
merely meaningless; they give the im-
pression of mediocrity attempting bizarre
methods and achieving only dullness.
Nor is the sculpture any more impressive
—Eve Pentley’s “Bird Motif” is a squat
piece of work resembling a snail with a
blunt head sitting up on its convention-
alised tail, and G. F. Lewers’s “Dance
Movement” is only two pieces of airy
metal, while his “Marine Movement”
could easily be mistaken for a
child’s floppy hat. Nor, in the long
run, are Eric Wilson’s or Ronald Steuart’s
paintings really outstanding— at best they
achieve a kind of half-life beside a
wilderness of cubes and pyramids.
“Hamfat”; A cat that decided to spend
an evening in front of the screen of a
picture theatre, calmly making its toilet
while a picture full of pistol-shots and
violence ran its course behind it, but
walked off disdainfully when the lovers
got to amorous holts, received its meed of
publicity in a Sydney paper. Audiences
always find the theatre cat a source of
hilarity. One that stepped aboard
H.M.S, Pinafore and took an unconcerned
stroll round the deck, and another that
walked coolly across a pool of water in
the background of a scene in “La
Mascotte” at old Her Majesty’s, Sydney,
“rocked the house” ; but I give the palm
to a theatre mouser which made its stage
appearance during a performance of
“East Lynne” at the Opera House, Auck-
land. The management had made
arrangements for a star singer to sing off-
stage “When Other Lips” when Archibald
Carlyle asks his new wife, Barbara, to
warble that ditty. It was just when the
stage Barbara had started to “dummy”
the singing at the piano, back to audience,
and the songster had started her singing
off-stage, that the theatre cat made its
appearance and proceeded to look for a
comfortable chair to snooze on. The
laugh, started in the audience, spread its
infection to the performers and, reach-
ing Barbara, caused her to double
up with mirth, abandoning all pretence
of singing or playing. But the song she
was supposed to be singing and the
accompaniment on the piano she cer-
tainly was not playing went on, to the
increased delight of the audience. When
Archibald had removed the cat, and the
gurgles of mirth had died down, the play
had to go back a few steps and start
again.
manoeuvre. The six destroyers spawned
a smother of white from their tails, to-
gether, and, still in perfect alignment,
swung round when the last of the line
cleared her buoy and headed seaward at
10 knots in line ahead. When well out
the convoy altered course to the eastward
and sailed into the Straits.
First Blood
Nestor soon demonstrated the efficiency
of her anti-submarine team. It is not diffi-
cult to “ping” on a 300 ft. submarine mov-
ing at 10 knots below surface ; but to pick
up and accurately plot the running of a
35-knot torpedo indicates operational skill
of an exceptional degree. The second
night out from Gibraltar Nestor’s A/S
officer heard through his mechanical ears
four torpedoes approaching. Warning
was at once flashed to the heavy units
and evasive action taken. One torpedo
cut through Renown’s wake and another,
set probably for bigger fry, passed
directly under Nestor.
Her reaction was natural and imme-
diate. She picked him up on her Asdic
and nosed down the beam like a blood-
hound. Over went the charges, dropping
into the sea with slight splashes that
swelled a moment later into pressure-
pounding mountains of spray. Nestor
twisted like a hungry otter in k pool of
fish, a trail of eruptions pacing her stern.
Seventeen charges were dropped before
contact ceased. Calming down, she re-
joined the convoy. Her effort later rated
a “possible” from the Admiralty.
With light the bombers came, high-
level and torpedo. Destroyer Fearless
had been dispatched from Gibraltar at
full speed to overtake the convoy with
orders. Torpedo-bombers were concen-
trating on Ark Royal, and Fearless slid
round her stern in time to collect an
aerial torpedo that blew her paper-thin
sides open to the sea. She was sunk by a
British destroyer.
Then a flight of Stukas fell upon de-
stroyer Firedrake and bombed her fore
and aft. The smoke-floats on her quarter-
deck went up in a great wall of white
smoke. One of her flotilla-mates stood
by, and Firedrake, trailing a curtain of
white smoke over the water, limped on
towards harbor. She eventually made it.
That night the convoy entered Pantel-
laria Straits—the infamous E-boat Alley.
Here a viper’s-nest of E-boats were wait-
ing for the choice targets the night would
bring them.
They attacked with full darkness.
Radar was in its infancy, and searchlights
swung, came back, steadied while a
stream of tracer poured along the white,
pointing fingers, then glared for the next
bow-waved target.
Sydney Star was steaming close to
Nestor. The merchantman's half-dozen
or so holds all contained petrol—-except
one. This held flour; and here an E-
boat’s torpedo hit her. Ordered alongside
ito take the troops Sydney Star was carry-
ing, Nestor nudged in under the dark
cliffs of Pantellaria and dropped her boats
between them to act as fenders. About
500 men scrambled across and fell or
were dragged on to the destroyer’s decks.
Nestor stood by all night, and as dawn
was breaking the damaged merchantman
succeeded in raising 10 knots. But the
convoy had gone on, and daylight found
Nestor and her charge on an empty sea. •
They were not left long alone. Air
attacks developed to such intensity that
Nestor, fighting her guns almost continu-
ously, was impelled to ask for air escort.
They couldn’t send her planes, but they
did send cruiser Hermione. Hermione
sailed into the fight with all her dual-
purpose main armament in vociferous
action, and in almost as many minutes
blew three planes out of the sky. Then,
with the rest of the convoy safely in and
Malta’s ramparts visible far ahead, there
came Beaufighters to clinch the argument.
When the trio entered Grand Harbor
that afternoon, Baracca Heights were
lined with a wildly-waving crowd, cheer-
ing to the echo. It was a tribute Nestor’s
men never forgot.
Enemy losses for this convoy were 12
planes shot down, two others probably so,
two damaged ; one E-boat sunk, another
damaged. Six British aircraft were lost,
with Sydney Star the only escorted ship
damaged.
U-boat Kill
With her departure from Malta on
August 31 for Freetown there ensued a
period of comparative quiet, broken
by three submarine incidents. The first
occurred off N. Africa, when a lookout
reported a conning-tower to port. Course
had been altered to ram when the object
was identified as a dead whale. Next,
after fuelling at Bathurst (Gambia),
Nestor gained a firm contact. She
dropped a full pattern of charges, but one
exploded prematurely under her stern,
seriously damaging the turbine feet. This
required a two-month relit at Plymouth.
Third time was lucky. She sailed from
Devonport dockyard on December 5,
1941, for Greenock. Three days later she
sailed again to rendezvous with a Gib-
raltar-bound convoy. Four days out the
convoy ran into a full gale, necessitating
slowing to 10 knots to avoid destroyer
damage. At that time 22 destroyers under
the C.-in-C. Western Approaches were in-
operative through weather damage.
On December 15, off Cape St. Vincent,
Nestor sighted a German U-boat on the
surface. The destroyer immediately
opened with her big guns, but the German
beat the shells under. Nestor raced up.
Soon she had him. She plunged on,
slowed, turned, raced on again. Then
she let go. Again and again and again,
until the whole sea convulsed. Soon
the spouting sea threw up what they
were waiting for —oil, wreckage, scraps
of a human body. After that contact
ceased.
For this kill Commander Rosenthal
won a bar to the D.S.O. the Malta convoy
had brought him.
The end of December found her with
sister-ships Napier and Nizam screening
cruiser Ajax (of the Plate) in a bombard-
ment of Bardia. She left the Mediter-
ranean then, as one of a screen for
carrier Indomitable, ferrying Hurricanes
to Singapore. The carrier flew off her
planes near Java, probably the first
occasion on which Hurricanes Mkll were
flown from a carrier at sea. The force
returned to Port Soudan, in the Red Sea,
for more planes. By the time it returned
Singapore had fallen, and Indomitable
flew off her brood 100 miles from Ceylon.
They were in time to welcome the first
Jap carrier-borne raid on Colombo.
Nestor was in the Indian Ocean, as far
south as Mombasa and Zanzibar, until
she steamed through Suez again in May,
1942. Malta’s position was critical, and
two convoys were about to be dispatched
simultaneously, one from Gibraltar, the
other from Alexandria. Nestor joined
her three Australian sisters, Napier,
Nizam and Norman, with 20 British de-
stroyers, as the eastern convoy’s screen.
There were also nine cruisers and five
corvettes, and about 60 ships in the
convoy. It sailed on the afternoon of
June 13.
The Last Convoy
Enemy air attacks, launched from bases
in Libya and Crete, began almost as soon
as the convoy cleared harbor. The air-
craft were mainly Junkers 88’s and Focke-
Wulfs. Barely visible when sighted,
minute black dots, they crept slowly up
the dome of the sky from the direction
of Crete. Then suddenly the two leading
destroyers broke into flame and wreathed
themselves in clouds of brown cordite
smoke. Up among the bombers a cluster
of black puffs blossomed, a flick of flame
in the centre of each. As though in
answer to the guns a whine started high
in the sky—a whine growing rapidly into
a screech of sound. Down they came, as
the bombs neared the water resolving
into a, streak too fast to follow. They
were aimed at a tanker, and they got her.
She went up in a sheet of flame.
The attacks which followed were among
the fiercest of the war. Early attacks
were concentrated on cruisers and mer-
chantmen, but were later diverted to the
destroyers, to reduce the screen and open
the heavy merchantmen to U-boats.
On the afternoon of June 16, after
almost unremitting attacks, a signal an-
nounced that the Gibraltar convoy had
fought its way to Malta. In view of the
ferocity of the attacks, and as the Italian
fleet was believed to be at sea, Nestor’s
convoy was ordered to return to Alex-
andria. At 1800 that night it was passing
through Bomb Alley, off the s.-w. corner
of Crete.
Nestor’s packet came suddenly. One
second she was steaming placidly, the
next a forest of water was hurled up
around her. A thousand-pounder ex-
ploded six feet from the port side, an-
other almost as close to starb’d and the
third just cleared her stern.
The little ship seemed to lift bodily
from the sea. When she fell back, her
boiler-rooms, holding under pressure
superheated steam that could peel a man’s
skin off like a boiled beetroot, were open
to the sea.
Engine-room crews at once rushed to
the rescue, but the steam beat them back.
The ship’s surgeon donned a smoke-
helmet, descended into the hell of oil and
hot water and brought four men on deck.
But they were too far gone.
Meanwhile steam had been shut off
and the bulkhead between boiler- and
engine-rooms shored up —just in time, for
the sea had burst the wall between A
and B boiler-rooms. All light and
power failed, as the auxiliary diesel equip-
ment was under water in A boiler-
room.
With dusk, torpedo-bombers flew in for
the kill, but Nestor’s guns, with British
destroyer Javelin and another Hunt-class
boat standing by, beat them off. At 1900
Javelin passed a tow, and both ships had
just raised three knots when an air attack
developed. They survived this, but danger
threatened from fire. It broke out in an
uptake of the boiler from A boiler-
room, the oil flaming as it floated on the
water. With no power on the pumps, the
ship’s company fought the blaze with
extinguishers and buckets. They suc-
ceeded in localising it, but the fire grew
more intense, and the flaming funnel was
an inviting beacon for every enemy craft
within miles.
Commander Rosenthal decided that
the only way to stifle the fire was to plug
her funnel with hammocks. Hundreds
of these, with blankets, were soaked, and
dropped into the funnel through its in-
spection hole. Two ratings volunteered
to climb in and trample on the bedding.
This they did, and within an hour the fire
was out.
By this time night was well-advanced.
Nestor was heavy by the bow, effective
steering without power was impossible,
and her fo’c’sle, swinging almost broad-
side on to the tow, had parted it twice.
The second time, not enough yvire re-
mained to resume it. At 0530 that morn-
ing, with his ship settling further by the
bow, Rosenthal requested Javelin to
break W/T silence and report his position
to the C.-in-C. Fifteen minutes later
Javelin passed the reply—Nestor was to
be scuttled.
Javelin transferred the crippled ship’s
crew, drew off, raced in and depth-
charged the Australian at close range.
The slamming charges split her plates,
and at about 0700 the gallant little craft
turned her bilges skyward and sank, 280
miles from Alexandria.

Map of the world found in a very rare work of the 10th century.
Charting a course. ..
From way back in the early centuries, navigators mapped a course for their voyages over the
uncertain seas. Such charts were surprisingly accurate when one considers the limited scientific
knowledge of those times.
In modern times the wise man can chart his course over turbulent seas; steering for the ultimate
port of security and independence. Now-a-days Life Assurance is a science so exact that it is able
to plan for the thrifty community and make every provision for the future.
In this the Metropolitan Life can meet every circumstance, pocket and purpose. It is a purely
Australian institution with all its funds invested in Australia for the protection of Australian families.
